incorporate those jokes I wrote for you.

degenerate joke. Yeah. Um,

51
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,640
Yeah, I kind of Shit. All right.
Here we go. It's your day job a lot.

52
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,220
I need some dick badly.

53
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,820
I'm fucking tired of wasting
this good ass fucking pussy.

54
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,300
Oh yeah. I'm fucking tired of it.
I'm fucking tired of my pussy.

55
00:04:15,301 --> 00:04:16,470
Just fucking white spin.

56
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,310
Oh, is Randy. Don't
bring anyone in loving.

57
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,640
Well,
go to your mom's house.

58
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,450
Did I know who you are when you do
that? When you play Air Guitar? Yeah.

59
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,210
You're the fucking dude from
the Bruce Springsteen band.

60
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:43,010
The ECP street who became an actor. Oh
yeah. Little Stevie. You're that guy.

61
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,100
Yeah. Little Steven. You look
just like him when you do it.

62
00:04:46,101 --> 00:04:50,540
Like you got the the dad.
Yeah. Yeah. Feeling that. Gosh,

63
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:55,690
I hate that band. Yeah. I also, I
think he like Frank Sinatra. Yeah.

64
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,390
We hate when Springsteen, Bob Dylan,
the three people I hate the most.

65
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,930
I hate those people too.
And that's why we are married now.

66
00:05:02,931 --> 00:05:07,910
There's some things we digress on.
Yeah, of course as well. I think, uh,

67
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,480
I would rather bring back some dictators
if it meant we could get rid of those

68
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:15,150
three. Do I mean obviously
one's dad. Sorry. Thanks.

69
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,760
Ooh,

70
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,110
I'm just a blue collar.

71
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,200
It's a blue goose Puma boots strips off.

72
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,590
I think I have a hard time
buying that because he's a,

73
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,000
he's like a millionaire millionaire
many times over. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

74
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:35,460
It's kind of hard.
I don't like Bob Dylan either,

75
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,680
just cause it doesn't make it in
the bag and Lizanne and I'm like,

76
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,840
I just don't really, I just don't
understand pretending to think it's good.

77
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,710
I mean, the very first time I heard I
was like, this is dog shit. Who is this?

78
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:49,380
I was Bob yelling at this is
what people talk about. Yeah.

79
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,670
This guy is who celebrated.
I'll tell you though,

80
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:54,240
there's people listening right now that
their heads are exploding because they

81
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,280
absolutely, they love these people. They
don't know what the fuck's going on.

82
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,780
Who Was it? Hello? Frank Sinatra.
Yeah. We hate, I don't hate him.

83
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:04,700
As much as I hate the hate him,
I just don't

84
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,470
pretend that it's like a real singing

85
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:13,180
that's not singing. It's singing songs.
Yeah. He's just been a lucky guy.

86
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:17,980
Be So lucky. That's shocking.
Fog Up. Sing talking. Yeah.

87
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,490
Yeah. It's that. Hey. Ooh.

88
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,140
By my luckiest guy on the block
prep pap pap. I'm like, okay.

89
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,610
I know we've talked to him about this.

90
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,620
There's a lot of stuff that people like
that I hate most. Most current music.

91
00:06:32,621 --> 00:06:35,770
I don't understand it. A lot of
it's done shit. Fucking get it.

92
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,053
Every time we're in the,

93
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,300
in the country club and they're pumping
some shit through the, I'm like,

94
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,760
what is it? Is this, I
will say that I like,

95
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,560
um, new discoveries when they're
good, like anybody would, right.

96
00:06:46,561 --> 00:06:49,200
It's like somebody says, try this food and
you're like, Whoa, what the fuck is it?

97
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:53,480
Like, so music wise, you know,
like I, I got into Thundercat
over the weekend. Yeah.

98
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,180
Play that for me. And I was like, this
feels like Stevie wonder. It feels,

99
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,960
it feels familiar, but to me it's a new
discovery. I was really excited about it.

100
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,540
You like daft punk lately.

101
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,610
I like that new, uh,
Pusha t album a Daytona,

102
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,980
which I'm, I mean I knew, I
obviously knew who he was,

103
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:14,790
but I'm saying it's like when something
new comes out that you can get excited

104
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:18,990
behind. I really much, I mean,
Kanye made the beets and it just,

105
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:23,280
it further prove my point when everyone
was accusing him of like whatever.

106
00:07:23,281 --> 00:07:25,440
He might be going nuts or
whatever. I was like, yeah,

107
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:30,270
but they won't care if he makes drops
that heat on the gun. Yeah. And those,

108
00:07:30,271 --> 00:07:31,104
uh,
those

109
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,740
saying, oh, I like Cardi B. There
you go. Um, she and I shared today.

110
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,910
Thank you guys by the way,
for tweeting her. Yeah.

111
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:42,911
A lot of sweets and that is exactly
what we want it to bombard Cardi B with

112
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,240
tweets about,
oh my God,

113
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:48,380
you set up the pregnancy with Christina
and she on Instagram posted a video.

114
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:49,214
She's like,

115
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:54,170
I just got to thank my baby for giving
me this luscious hair and these big

116
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:57,890
boobs. You know what I'm
saying? Like she's, she really
is all about it right now.

117
00:07:57,891 --> 00:08:01,850
And I agree. She and I are, you know,
pregnancy besties, yes. For pregnancy.

118
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:06,110
Betsey's yeah. I like, I love my hair to,
my hair doesn't get that good. But anyway,

119
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,340
it's interesting. She and I share a due
date. It's very, we're going to have a,

120
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:13,220
I mean a little different.
She might do water births together.

121
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,880
She's going to fly out here. She might
do a actually announced that gender.

122
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:19,060
We're going a little different
route. You know, what's Your Pronoun?

123
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,490
You don't and believe on an
inflicting that kind of thing.

124
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,820
It's for them to decide. Yeah. Our,

125
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,560
our nursery is totally gender neutral.
[inaudible] yellows,

126
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,240
Greens, orange. I don't believe
in specific toys either.

127
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:40,010
I also believe in asking every
day. Yeah, let's do like today.

128
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,160
What are you today?
Especially starting around six months old,

129
00:08:43,161 --> 00:08:46,190
I asked for consent when I change
their diaper. Always asked for consent.

130
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,960
When you change a diaper feed, you know,
pick them up, bathed them and then,

131
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,000
cause that works, right. We're
asking, we have experiences with,

132
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,180
with one so far and they,

133
00:08:57,181 --> 00:09:01,290
they're really good at signaling when
they want to do things that are for there

134
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,070
or the word yes. We hear the word
yes a lot from a toddler. Yeah. Yeah.

135
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:08,340
It's one of their first word.
Yes. I'm thinking about it. Maybe.

136
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,430
Let me consider the options. They're
very rational, you know creatures. Sure.

137
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,620
So, um, well that's one of the
reasons I don't have baby showers.

138
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:20,950
I don't believe in having that binary
structure. Yeah. On gender mix.

139
00:09:20,951 --> 00:09:24,320
Lots of people giving me
gender specific things. Um,

140
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,820
I will say it is rare

141
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,070
but always a treat when full.
First of all,

142
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,880
when to like for instance when
a couple of weeks ago when um,

143
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,130
the female listeners sent
in there try it out videos,

144
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,370
which is a really a spectacular treat.

145
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,780
And then now when we get a video like
this where it's a woman saying she wants

146
00:09:44,781 --> 00:09:47,450
the sex, cause there's, I'll,
I'll let you know a little secret.

147
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,140
There's no shortage of men out
there who make requests like this,

148
00:09:51,141 --> 00:09:54,200
but when it's a lady,
it's a very special thing.

149
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,050
Well it's a role reversal
where generally not that, um,

150
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,480
forward about our sexual needs and desires

151
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,880
forward is, is a understatement
for this. I think.

152
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,070
Yeah. I want to get fucked meal. Okay.

153
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,930
I should be able to get fucked when
I want to get fucked. She's running.

154
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,990
I worked so fucking hard and I never got
no fuckin time to get no fucking Dick.

155
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:16,850
Like this shit is.

156
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,780
Yeah. Well, she does have a point. Look,
she's a very attractive woman. She works.

157
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,530
I feel like women,
it's easier for us to get lazy.

158
00:10:24,531 --> 00:10:25,990
She should be able to walk with her prop.

159
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,340
Why didn't she should be able to walk into
like a park and go, who wants to fuck?

160
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,710
And then a guy that I think maybe she has

161
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,680
like a like is the problem
that she's going after.

162
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,180
Sure. Unattainable men are
like, no, you can't not get sex.

163
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,280
She's going after losers.
That's the problem. Losers.

164
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,710
But she's not even getting it
from losers. It doesn't, it.

165
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,450
She's getting it from scumbags.
My,

166
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,600
my thinking is she's
attracting the wrong kinds,

167
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,960
but she's saying, Fuck Neil. Okay.

168
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,210
I should be able to get fucked
when I want to get fucked.

169
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,120
Did she say she can't get it? Period?
I don't know what's happening. I mean,

170
00:10:57,121 --> 00:11:00,840
is she going to the right places?
Are you going to bars? I don't know.

171
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:02,610
Are Willing to go to la.
I deserve

172
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,820
to be getting my face fucked
right near your face and my dope.

173
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Suffocate me. Talking dot.

174
00:11:10,941 --> 00:11:13,670
You can go to fuck tablet and fuck
who I want to fuck up there too.

175
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,370
Mm hmm.
She might have some

176
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,650
new doctor drew.
Yeah.

177
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,710
Fuck me lady.

178
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:29,880
Yeah. By the way, I always,
uh, as always a huge thing.

179
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:30,714
So Dr drew.
Okay.

180
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,500
I loved it. We love it. Yeah. I
mean when he's here he thinks I'm,

181
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,160
I'm being a little, is it
sadistic one? Yeah, he was,

182
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:42,070
I was really happy cause he was getting
on you more than me. This, yeah. He,

183
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,913
he really,

184
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,530
he thinks that I'm laughing
at his uncomfortability
and upon further specular,

185
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,760
uh, analysis analysis. I
think some of it's that,

186
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:56,090
but I think some of it is also the of
having somebody so over qualify like a

187
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:02,020
legit doctor. He's also been, you know,
40 years treating people with a DA,

188
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,560
like he's really overqualified and
having him watch are ridiculous videos of

189
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:06,394
course,

190
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,320
is such a joy for me and I get giddy
knowing that we're asking him to analyze

191
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:14,560
these ridiculous videos. It's
just, it's my most favorite thing.

192
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,480
There's one or two things going on here.

193
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,750
This is either a smart lady who realizes
the comedy and doing this and she's

194
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:27,601
doing it because she knows it will get
tons of views or it's a very mentally

195
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:29,020
unstable person.

196
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,140
She should give out her address like
the guide does and try it out. Guy,

197
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,600
she would get lots of responses.
You got to get up.

198
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,390
You got to give back to her address or
your phone number if she wants to respond.

199
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,220
Let's see, cause that's your so
far. I mean, see, here's my point.

200
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:45,320
Like there's no way this
lady can't get someone to,

201
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,910
she's cute was Ding Dong in her
throat. Yeah, that's easy peasy.

202
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,840
Request that be a challenge. You know?
She's like, no one will do it. Bullshit.

203
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,080
You'd do it, but do it right now.
If she was in the other room,

204
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:59,160
I just walk in there and do it and be
like, is this what you needed? It's,

205
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,540
and it's a silly thing.
That can't be true.

206
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,860
I can't do this no more.
I need some fucking Dick like this.

207
00:13:04,861 --> 00:13:07,740
I can't live like this.
Like what the fuck?

208
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,690
I got some good at Olympian Olympian.

209
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,603
Hmm.

210
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,203
Yeah.

211
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,490
Worldstar clips.
Okay.

212
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,740
There it is.
That's the reason.

213
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,990
Oh man, she's an angel.
I don't understand what,

214
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,180
well, the, the, the overt crazy as a
deterrent. Yeah, it might be the problem,

215
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,460
but it's still, I would still
go in there at least for one.

216
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,920
One not cause she, you know,
she's going to blow up your phone.

217
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,780
There's going to be multiple texts.
There's going to be followup call.

218
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,090
She might find your fucking home and
stock. You went, this bitch is too crazy.

219
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,970
That's the problem. You go to her
place to give her a fake number.

220
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:02,800
I mean 35,000 texts girl 65.
Oh Shit.

221
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:07,420
Don't just leave 30,000 on the table.
That's the problem.

222
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,380
That's too bad. Put It on my throat and
he ain't going to fuck me from the bag.

223
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,550
Love this girl.

224
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,670
You love it.
All that stuff.

225
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:23,610
You joke about. You love her. She's great.

226
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,810
This is your second
wife. This could be, it

227
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:34,430
should be good influence. Great mom.
Yeah. That's all I'm thinking about. Yeah.

228
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,940
Now,
speaking of love affairs,

229
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:42,350
particularly yours and mine, um,
yesterday you came downstairs.

230
00:14:42,351 --> 00:14:43,610
She had been fighting this cold,

231
00:14:43,611 --> 00:14:48,611
getting over it and in the morning we
have some coffee before we pick up LJ from

232
00:14:48,711 --> 00:14:52,370
the crib and you were hawking and

233
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:58,340
bringing up your phlegm in the kitchen
as we were talking and drinking and I

234
00:14:58,341 --> 00:15:00,590
look over and I'm like,
Eh, it's okay. All right.

235
00:15:00,591 --> 00:15:02,930
I held my tongue and then you got up.

236
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,110
I didn't when I did,
when I saw you

237
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:15,200
hawking a loogie into our kitchen sink,

238
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,390
sink the bar. It's somewhere that
we wash our hands, we wash glasses.

239
00:15:20,391 --> 00:15:25,391
The kid plays in like not really an ideal
place for hogging like a sick loogie

240
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,900
and I called it to your attention.
I was like,

241
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:33,980
do you think you could make me not do
that in the kitchen and do that in the

242
00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:37,880
bathroom? And I swear it. The
look on your face was like,

243
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:43,070
what? Like you were indignant
like righteous indignation.

244
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:47,900
Like I can't believe this bitch is
telling me I can't hock a loogie in my

245
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:51,660
kitchen saying it was, it was,
yeah, it was. It was, you know,

246
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,870
it was kind of annoying.
It's annoying.

247
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,130
Especially because at that bathroom was
like five whole steps from where you

248
00:15:58,131 --> 00:16:02,960
cock the five steps. I mean, here's
the thing, you know, when you're,

249
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,760
when you're getting through, fighting
through and getting out of a, uh,

250
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,050
sick a bronchial thing,

251
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:14,570
worst time is definitely the morning for
cleaning it because what happens is you

252
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:17,660
sit there, I know. And that
stuff just drips all night.

253
00:16:17,661 --> 00:16:20,390
So you wake up and it's just,
uh, it's like you're coming,

254
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:25,430
you really come in through some,
some dog shit. So you know,

255
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:27,680
the first thing is you
take your morning pice.

256
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:32,750
I now know no line now with you, it's
a medley of sound. I know, you know,

257
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:35,570
it's interesting cause I know what you're
doing in the next room just based on

258
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:38,840
sounds. The other day I was like, oh are
you scratching your nuts? And you're like,

259
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:41,570
how'd you know? I'm like, cause
I can hear it. I know the,

260
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,590
I know what each one means.
Like a deeper,

261
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,820
that's about scratch. A lighter
sounds, the front scratch.

262
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:55,100
So when you get up to pee and there's
multiple farts, that's a morning pee.

263
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:58,760
Generally not at night. It's a
specifically a morning. Sure.

264
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,700
So when I got down there,
I was ready to drink my coffee,

265
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:05,060
but then I just kind of took
a deep breath. I was like, oh,

266
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:08,600
there's some stuff to bring it up.
Then I brought it up in the kitchen.

267
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:11,120
I wasn't really thinking,
you know? No, I know.

268
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,930
I know you weren't fun part I then,
I

269
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,340
know before that you had a
paper towel that you would like,

270
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:24,140
like a dirty paper towel you'd found on
the kitchen table and then that one you

271
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:27,890
were spitting into. Oh, I
forgot. I block that one out.

272
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,560
I almost vomited.

273
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,690
I almost vomited and I thought
surely he can't take this further.

274
00:17:35,691 --> 00:17:37,220
And that's when you got up and you,

275
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,490
while they were jumping over the fact
that when my first got up I was like,

276
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:44,810
I got a pretty big boner right now.
Right. Which is kind of normal for you.

277
00:17:44,811 --> 00:17:49,610
But then your choice of like courting me
and getting me on board with the, yeah.

278
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,850
Was the Hawk and horrific and make
these sounds and be disgusting.

279
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,730
So like in your mind you're like,

280
00:17:56,731 --> 00:17:59,880
oh I got this bone or I love my
wife to help me out with it. Like,

281
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:04,860
and then every flower blooms
differently. Yeah. Yeah.

282
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,830
Color.
I got this boner.

283
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,210
So gross. I like how you're
like, why don't you give me
blow jobs? I'm like, mom,

284
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,600
you know, seven a half months pregnant.
I just barfing to my own mouth all day,

285
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,170
which I'm fine with.
It's really not what I want to do that no,

286
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,050
but I mean I don't, I wouldn't let
it, I wouldn't be bothered by it.

287
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:33,900
I would just have constant
heartburn. My bad. Yeah.

288
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:39,000
Anyways, that was our sexy life
yesterday. Then we watched a sexy movie.

289
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:43,470
Yeah. Molly would avoiding
this movie. I know.

290
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:47,460
I don't know why. I think it's just,
I'm not a fan of the, uh, the artwork.

291
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,900
I might have found a trailer.
Yeah.

292
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,430
Movies much better than the artwork
or the trailer. Well the artwork,

293
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:54,510
you know why you don't like it?

294
00:18:54,511 --> 00:18:58,350
Cause it looks like it's marketed to women
because they use a pink font, I think.

295
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,550
And so I'm sure guys are like,
I don't want to watch some chick movie.

296
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,090
And it's not really a chick movie at all.
Check movie.

297
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,950
She's a woman who is doing extraordinary
things and it's interesting. But yeah,

298
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:14,950
they didn't market it correctly.
It's Jessica's to chest
day in and she plays, um,

299
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:20,090
Molly bloom who was an Olympic skier and
then ended up running poker games like

300
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:26,610
exclusive poker games in Los Angeles
and later in New York too. Dark titties.

301
00:19:26,611 --> 00:19:30,210
Yeah. And uh, anyways, it's a great,
it's a really cool story. It's,

302
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:34,950
it's really well done movie
about gambling, but it's
more about her tests. Well,

303
00:19:34,951 --> 00:19:39,630
her tits were spectacular. They were
out the entire movie tire. There wasn't,

304
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,140
there was one scene where they
covered the up and I thought this,

305
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,540
I wonder why they're covering it.
I'm up now just to kind of,

306
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,370
it's the kind of movie and the kind of
tickets where you're wondering why there

307
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:54,210
isn't a more in depth conversation about
her kids in the movie because he does

308
00:19:54,211 --> 00:19:57,720
bring it up once her attorney is like,
you may want to dress down for court.

309
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,610
Like that's right.
I thought he was going to be like,

310
00:19:59,611 --> 00:20:01,920
that judge is going to ask the
suck on her tits or something.

311
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:07,200
And I have to say as a, as a
cisgendered woman, heterosexual,

312
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,950
I didn't, I normally don't. I'm
not fascinated by tits. The whole,

313
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:14,370
I was like enraptured looking
at it only that you, um,

314
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,310
right away started the conversation.
You Go, do you think they're real?

315
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:21,580
And my immediate feedback was 100%.
I think they're real now. See,

316
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,050
let's talk about this because
she's very petite. She's very tiny.

317
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:28,020
She was very clear to have such
big cans on such a small body.

318
00:20:28,021 --> 00:20:31,950
I could tell that there was
a lot of help in, in uh,

319
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,530
giving out that type of cleavage.
Other words,

320
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,160
there was a supportive bra and tight,

321
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:42,780
close up top pressing those
two photographs of people
watching can see what

322
00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:45,180
you're talking about. She's, first
of all, she's very beautiful.

323
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:49,720
She's very made up in this film. I think
every single scene. She's got full hair.

324
00:20:49,721 --> 00:20:53,020
Full makeup. Yeah. At a certain
point. Yeah. She's super,

325
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:57,240
super made up and every dress
is like a titty showcase stress.

326
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,920
Yeah. Even court. She's wearing like a
titty. You can see there's her tits there.

327
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,420
Her tits are there. See I do think they're
real action real. I think the real,

328
00:21:07,421 --> 00:21:11,500
they have a natural, they have
a natural drop to them. Yeah.

329
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,270
And then they're just exposed more.

330
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:17,560
And this bra is lifting them
up and pushing them together.
Which giving this, uh,

331
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:21,920
you know the cleavage, which is really
nice. The thing I will tell you,

332
00:21:21,921 --> 00:21:22,830
a big fan of her droop.

333
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,010
Here's how you can tell by the way is
the real good girl right here where the

334
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:30,370
real girl and she's got big tits to yeah.

335
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:35,680
So the thing is she looks like she
definitely is down. She's real pretty too.

336
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:40,480
She's just the real girl is prettier
than Jessica Chasteen I aren't there.

337
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,160
See now here's is interesting is
that that looks like a faker. Faker.

338
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:49,180
Here's how you can tell if tits are real.
If when you put them in at raw,

339
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,670
they mashed together. Okay. That,

340
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:56,671
that like fat lady cleavage where the
tits are real tits mushed together cause

341
00:21:57,671 --> 00:22:02,140
it's squishy. Fakers separate.
They're, they're a part,

342
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:06,790
there's a big cavern between the two
now. It could, it could just be her bra.

343
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,920
Yeah. See I can't tell cause there was
there it wasn't like real hangers. Yeah.

344
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:15,420
Yeah. But then sometimes they
look fake cause she's so petite.

345
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,730
This is all the movie stuff.
This is her at um,

346
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,080
a premier right here and they look well.
Is there any like casual tip pictures?

347
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:27,850
So this is her at a movie premier.
She, she'd got the side spillage here.

348
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:31,180
That looks like real tit meat.
Cause my tent meet.

349
00:22:31,181 --> 00:22:33,790
We'll do that cause fake tits.

350
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:38,260
You'll kind of see the bag like there
are hard and you see those fall real.

351
00:22:38,261 --> 00:22:41,740
See how they're mushed
together in the middle. They're
nice. Yeah. Not the perfect.

352
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:42,970
He's got real nice tits.

353
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,030
Wait until she pumps out a couple of
kids that we can get her on the show.

354
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:50,590
Join them now I would love is
the articles about her cleavage.

355
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:55,650
Oh cool. Keeping it classy.
Oh she's still 40. Damn.

356
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,960
Really? She ain't got no kids.
That's why they'll titties.

357
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,530
Look all night if she doesn't have kids.

358
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:05,230
I'm just assuming maybe she had him
lifted after some bitches are lucky they

359
00:23:05,231 --> 00:23:08,770
have kids or tits. Pop
right back. Hi Mine Minor,

360
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,670
the state troopers for life.
I had to get something done,

361
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:16,720
especially with a second kid.
It's a disaster now. See that's,

362
00:23:16,721 --> 00:23:19,570
that's the outfit she wears
in court and then there real,

363
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:25,450
the whole, everything is about those
tits. Molly's, Molly's takes ticket.

364
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,350
But it was, it's a good movie. If
you guys were looking for a movie,

365
00:23:29,351 --> 00:23:30,790
you haven't seen it.
I think it's uh,

366
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,710
it's definitely an entertaining
and you like tits. These,

367
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,540
this is the kind of show you're
going to, like, you got a wife,

368
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,260
it doesn't let you look at stuff.
You can be like, let's watch Malia.

369
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:45,700
I heard it was a really cool story.
And then you stare at Ted's room. No,

370
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:50,810
interesting analysis, Tom. But
here's the thing. So I texted, uh,

371
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:56,540
this fun of ours. He works as
a stylist. He'd silo styles,

372
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:59,790
all these celebrities, you know, I
said, do you know Jessica Chastain?

373
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,840
You work with her? He goes, I
don't style her. I asked him,

374
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:05,780
do you think those tits are real? He
goes, oh, yeah, yeah, those are real.

375
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,640
I've seen her before and he's a gay
guy, so guys, they know this stuff.

376
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,403
They really know.

377
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:17,490
Um, according to this, I don't,
I don't think she has kids.

378
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,750
Yeah. That's why those titties
look nice. Yeah. Yeah. She, she 40,

379
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:22,650
she had tests like that.

380
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,840
I ain't got no kids. It doesn't say
here. I mean, it says that she's, uh,

381
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,113
she's married,

382
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:34,530
looks like to a real fucking Guinea.
Gian look up bossy that,

383
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,180
that see an actor and he's

384
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,860
a normal person.

385
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,970
Just, uh, yeah. Anyways.

386
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,250
Yeah. But those tickets are,
they're really something.

387
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,880
And her teeth are nice and white too.
Like she has really white teeth.

388
00:24:53,881 --> 00:24:58,200
I admire that. She has really
nice teeth. Those are important,

389
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,440
especially as a movie star. Now,
you know, you're a movie star now.

390
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,760
Do you think you'll get yours whitened?

391
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:08,120
Um, uh, there's still a little, oh,

I hit in the face. Oh my

406
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,690
Do you know that

00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,990
25 times a week people send
me a link to Jean Segura.

catcher immediately where we
get to the brewers dug out.

411
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:24,550
That is not a good sign
for gene sucker off.

412

And there's a bodybuilder
named Maria cigarette. Yeah,

It's a committed 80 miles an
hour, but still at all, nothing.

414
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,900
It almost sounded like it
hit part of the helmet.

415
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,910
Shit hit with a base

416
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:50,840
walking to first base.
That's a great sign. No.

417
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,300
Did he have a helmet on? He did. Right?
He did. Yes. Yeah. When we were, you know,

418
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,050
my previous girlfriend, yeah, we were
always telling him to wear his helmet.

419
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,820
So glad he did. Yeah, me too.

420
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:04,660
I've been hit in the head
with a playing doubles tennis.

421
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:09,310
My partner was serving and she
served the ball right into my head,

422
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:14,020
the back of my head. That was
really horrible. That happens.
It does. It's not good.

423
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:17,140
I hit my cousin Janette with
a baseball bat. What? Yeah,

424
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:21,380
why I was at tee ball and uh,

425
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,840
yeah, I uh, and I hit that. I hit
Brian rather guys and get the same bat.

426
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:29,800
So there was a tea set up. Maybe
you have played the ball. Yeah,

427
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:32,650
it was pretty bad at it. And we
were kids. We were probably seven,

428
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,720
eight and on the back swing I hit um,

429
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,940
Jeanette and the head. Well, why the
fuck was she standing so close to you?

430
00:27:39,941 --> 00:27:44,020
I Dunno. So that was a whole ordeal.
She went inside or is a lot of tears.

431
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,430
And then it was like,
all right,

432
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:50,431
try it this time and this time I went
and I hit the ball off the tee and on the

433
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:55,490
follow up I got in the swing through
I clocked Brian and the jaw. Yeah.

434
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,980
As bad.
Yeah.

435
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:01,660
I mean there are a lot of tears and then
I ran home cause I was so fucking upset

436
00:28:01,661 --> 00:28:05,920
and scared. It was terrible. I thought
I killed my two cousins. Yeah you did.

437
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,750
Yeah. Pretty bad. Help you stop playing
tee ball after that. That was it.

438
00:28:10,751 --> 00:28:13,850
That was the last time ever picked up
a bat. Yeah, that sounds fucking more,

439
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,460
I hope our kid doesn't play tee ball.

440
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,400
It sounds like the most boring shit
to watch. It sounds pretty terrible.

441
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,900
So baseball is so slow, man. That's one
smart. I can't really watch for long.

442
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,990
That's pretty bad. Yeah.
I'm not into it at all.

443
00:28:25,991 --> 00:28:29,860
What can we get them into that
involves indoors air conditioning,

444
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:35,340
you know like swimming.
Swimming is great, right?

445
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,820
Yeah.
Is he running?

446
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,200
That's outdoors shit or the indoor sports,
I don't know.

447
00:28:41,201 --> 00:28:44,530
But I want to be able to be comfortable
in the, in the warmer months here.

448
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,490
Water Polo. Yeah. Water Polo. Okay.
That's good hockey you can do indoors.

449
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:53,710
That's dangerous. I don't like
hockey. Hockey is dangerous. Um, no,

450
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:58,450
no, no. Archery. Archery. Okay.
That's not a real sport. Oh,

451
00:28:58,451 --> 00:29:01,390
you get them into martial arts? I
was always in dance. Good. Yeah.

452
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,710
That's air condition. Yeah.
Comfortable seating. That's
what you want, right? Yeah.

453
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:10,240
So what we'll show them, we'll show him
like we'll get a, uh, a pamphlet ready.

454
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:15,280
Yeah. Of only indoor sports that's
comfortable. Seating and air conditioning.

455
00:29:15,281 --> 00:29:19,780
I'll be like
shoes and no traveling.

456
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:23,140
I don't want to have to get on airplanes
on the weekends to take him to games

457
00:29:23,141 --> 00:29:26,510
and other states places.
This is like mother of the year stuff

458
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,650
and then when he goes a soccer
bag, it's impossible. Sorry. Yeah.

459
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,553
It's an outdoors work.

460
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:36,730
And also I don't want to have to bring
snacks for the entire team or be involved

461
00:29:36,731 --> 00:29:40,660
in any way. Yeah. What kind of sports do
they have for that? Yeah. I think you're,

462
00:29:40,661 --> 00:29:45,180
you're, you're really excluding a lot of
sports right now. Not a lot left. Yeah.

463
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,740
Soccer signers. Okay. Right.

464
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,950
He can't definitely outdoors and there's
definitely traveling. That's the boy.

465
00:29:50,951 --> 00:29:55,810
Yeah. Yeah. Fuck how he can't
get hurt that bad. Right.

466
00:29:55,811 --> 00:30:00,610
With soccer you can get hurt for sure.
You sprain your ankle or some shit.

467
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,140
No football. No. People get fucked
up playing soccer. Not every,

468
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,430
not every game, but I mean people get
kicked in the head and knees to the head.

469
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,530
You know how they break man,

470
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,860
but he's not going to play soccer because
he's going to have your built and your

471
00:30:14,861 --> 00:30:19,390
stature and your body. You're not
built for soccer. I'm not sure.

472
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:23,530
You're built for couch.
What else?

473
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,820
What sports you lifting
things heavy things. Yeah. His
grandfather was a good, uh,

He's got your bill. The segora built.

475
00:30:30,281 --> 00:30:34,290
So what kinds of things or weight lifting.
There you go, that's, that's safe. Oh,

476
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:38,890
that's indoors. That's

477
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,150
No. Fuck the bake anything.
Yeah. There you go. Weight
lifting. We found the sport.

478
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:47,280
There you go. I like

479
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,100
What else are you guys good at?
And that's pretty much it.

480
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,830
Just lifting heavy shit.
That's what he was best at my desk.

481
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:57,910
Both of you are good at Diane
broad shoulders. Really good. Yeah.

482

the toilet the other day? Yeah, he did.

483
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:07,000
He showed me that he was using a handicap
stall. He always takes pride in that.

484
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,180
What is this here? Somebody
sent me this as this. This time?

485

robbed by me. Yes. I mean
Shit. I mean I wouldn't get it.

00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:31,970
Yeah, I'm the same way. I don't care. Just
don't give a shit. It doesn't bother me.

489
00:31:31,971 --> 00:31:32,640

511
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:59,750
a lot of times actors are looking
for monologues to perform for class.

512
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:03,140
You could see it or yeah,
for stage.

513
00:33:03,141 --> 00:33:06,500
This is definitely something that we've
shown to be very versatile as a piece.

514
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:10,620
And you take this into an acting
class, I guarantee you, you're,

515
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:14,070
you're acting coaches attention if

560
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:44,540

actually on a jog. That's amazing.

568
00:37:11,721 --> 00:37:14,240
And then what is this?
This is another animation that came in.

569
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:19,180
No black guys fucking fuck. Good. Okay.

570
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:24,270

576
00:37:46,751 --> 00:37:47,584
It's two men and

577
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:52,910

Okay. The stuttering.

579
00:37:56,451 --> 00:38:00,420
I love when they get the frantic
sputtering and the, yeah, yeah.

580
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:05,060
Movie to him.
Hot White trash come down off the truck.

581
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:10,040
Yeah, it's pretty wide. What's interesting
about Drew's last appearance? Um,

582
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,210
well there's a few things but also that
the mental illness and the drug use,

583
00:38:14,211 --> 00:38:18,350
it's hard to tell which is which. Yeah.
Which was kind of a revelation. Like, oh,

584
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,690
is it math or is it just he's mentally
ill. Sure. So lots to think about.

585
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,793
Yeah.

586
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:30,950
Why don't we take a short break here
and prepare for our guests? Yeah, yeah,

587
00:38:30,951 --> 00:38:35,860
sure. Sure. It about to arrive and farts.
Push the shit out. This shit out. Huge.

588
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:36,610
And

589
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:38,900
he really felt like I liked it. He got
a little defensive. He's like, well,

590
00:38:38,901 --> 00:38:41,350
well hold on a second, let me,
um, let me address this. Like,

591
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,370
he wasn't just going to let that slide
because he does not believe that far.

592
00:38:45,371 --> 00:38:48,250
It's pushed to shit or that shit.
Shit's, pushes the farts out.

593
00:38:48,251 --> 00:38:52,420
He didn't completely,
wow.

594
00:38:52,421 --> 00:38:54,480
We learned something every
time with doctor drew. Maybe.

595
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:58,500
Sure dupe many thanks to him. All right.
We'll be back shortly. You won't know.

596
00:38:58,501 --> 00:38:59,740
As always that we paused

597
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,150
and we're back from the pause
you never knew about. Um,

598
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:09,190
and joining us as long overdue,
um, is really long overdue.

599
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,290
You may know him from standup specials,

600
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:14,620
a television shows and a,

601
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:18,700
you may have mispronounced his name
for years. Um, uh, I've seen it.

602
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:22,690
I've seen it live and in
person. I've heard you say
that before. Like people say,

603
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:25,840
I was with them, I was with them on the
street in Vancouver and they're like,

604
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:30,880
that's funny when someone says, I love
you, I love you Chris. Delea. Yeah, yeah,

605
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,870
they still Leah,
it's delete.

606
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:36,220
And it won't matter that I
said that though because it
will still happen all the

607
00:39:36,221 --> 00:39:39,760
time. I say it. I make sure to say it. I
said apostrophes are until you know it,

608
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:44,080
message it. Really? No,
it's Sally. Sally, come on.

609
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:51,100
I don't know. No, it um, it's
Italian and they, they just say,

610
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:55,990
I mean people everyday Dalon Chris
long don't want to add an hell.

611
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,630
Yeah. It's like there's one
fucking, isn't that funny?

612
00:39:58,631 --> 00:40:01,540
Like someone sees a symbol and they're
like, I want to fuck with that. Yeah,

613
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,640
I know. I then you go like, just, it's
phonetic dude. I know. Telia yeah,

614
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,680
I get, I guess Delea I guess
I could understand, but
people fuck it up way worse.

615
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:15,160
I mean, I've been on the phone with people
where they go like, oh, you missed her a

616
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:20,670
yours mine because they go,
I think what happens is you don't,

617
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:23,530
mine's not as intimidating,
but you know,

618
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:26,830
to some people at [inaudible]
and they'll start to go like,

619
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:30,270
I want to say this wrong man.
And I'm like, just sound it out.

620
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,400
It's exactly the way it seems completely
phonetic. Holy for now. Which of course

621
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,980
that's why I go by p the
letter p I always upset it. I,

622
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:44,770
I always knew I was dating or for real.
Like I was like,

623
00:40:44,771 --> 00:40:49,360
I liked this girl when I could
spell it. Oh yeah. You're like,

624
00:40:49,361 --> 00:40:54,310
I don't have to look it up or something.
I was like her diehard friend.

625
00:40:54,311 --> 00:40:58,000
My real friends can spell my last name.
Now is your, is your mom Italian also?

626
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:02,380
My mom is Italian. Yeah, but she's
all, her maiden name is Dombrowski.

627
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:07,060
She's pulling the Broski.
She from the old country,

628
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:12,730
her parents, her parents, parents and
shit like that. Got that deep trauma.

629
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:17,630
Yeah. I don't know. I don't know how much,
I don't know how much trauma is and we,

630
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,950
I don't know how much traumas
in her family, like early,

631
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:25,120
like way back when Paul locks. Are
they Jews to no Polish. Yeah. I met,

632
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:28,720
I hung out with the delay is
in Vancouver.

633
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:32,870
It was when he shot his last passion.
You were there the night before I,

634
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,700
something like that. I might,
yeah, the vogue, right? Yeah,

635
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:38,930
the vote and I was there the day
after you. Oh, you were? Yeah.

636
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:41,030
So you'd shot your
special like on a Friday.

637
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:44,300
Got Your mind was Saturday and
they didn't change the marquee,

638
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:47,780
which was really cool. I
did anyway, they gave her,

639
00:41:47,781 --> 00:41:52,580
they were giving me shit about not doing
the alt show after my show. Yeah. Oh.

640
00:41:52,581 --> 00:41:54,200
And I was like,
I'm done feeling,

641
00:41:54,201 --> 00:41:59,060
it gave me shit about doing it after
shooting my special lights. I was like,

642
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:03,380
well, I'm not, I'm not going to do that.
You know? And the guy was like, we can't,

643
00:42:03,381 --> 00:42:07,000
we're counting on you. I'm
like, for the alt show. Why?

644
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,780
They are like a cause. And then when,
when they were like a, you know,

645
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:15,560
like agents and managers were kind
of giving shit back. They're like,

646
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:20,480
you haven't even changed the Mark
Key. All right. All right. All right.

647
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:25,190
Are Bad on that. Yeah. I remember Josh
or manager would always just be like,

648
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:28,020
I remember he would just be
like, you can do it. You know,

649
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:30,950
they really want you there. They want you
to do it. I'll tell him, no, I could tell,

650
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:35,780
you know, I'm like, dude, I'm not doing
right. By the way, by the way, by the way,

651
00:42:35,781 --> 00:42:39,650
though, me as me, by the
way, he did, uh, I did.

652
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,670
I was talking about him on my podcast
and they apparently like every like week,

653
00:42:43,671 --> 00:42:47,720
like somebody like, dude, Chris
Lou talked to like in the business,

654
00:42:47,721 --> 00:42:50,930
people like from ca are like, dude, have
you heard this? He's like, I'm heard it.

655
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:56,000
Alright. Wow. Because he
would always say, dude,

656
00:42:56,001 --> 00:42:59,030
every time I would pitch a fucking
idea to him, he'd be like, well,

657
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,810
there's a show in there. He would
say and do it. And I'd be like, no,

658
00:43:02,811 --> 00:43:05,850
it's a fucking show, dude. It's
their show. And they just want it.

659
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,060
And I guess tried to do the work,

660
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:16,590
uh, by the way, flush it out. Yeah.

661
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,910
Yeah. It was a lot of years we've
been hearing those fucking phrase.

662
00:43:22,911 --> 00:43:26,420
I mean me and you were like his first,
yeah, two of the first I remember,

663
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,560
I remember meeting you in front of the
Melrose Improv. This has gotta be like,

664
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:35,000
oh seven w and I remember asking you, I
actually remember asking him like, Oh,

665
00:43:35,001 --> 00:43:38,450
do you guys, or do you work with him? And
you're like, oh, he's like helping me out.

666
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:42,710
Oh Wow. Was that long ago, Jesus. And I
was like, what do you mean? You're like,

667
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,900
glad I even know what that meant.
You're like, like he's helped me out,

668
00:43:44,901 --> 00:43:48,110
but I'm not like a clinic. So it was
probably, so what happened was I,

669
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:53,000
I had started doing
standup in 2005 and uh, I,

670
00:43:53,001 --> 00:43:55,250
before that I was like,
like a writer.

671
00:43:55,251 --> 00:43:59,300
Like I had made money optioning
scripts in shit. Really? Yeah. Yeah.

672
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,590
And um,
and I,

673
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:06,630
I started doing standup and my manager
at three arts named Stephanie Davis,

674
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:09,260
who was great. She would always
be like, you should do stand up.

675
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,010
And I would be like, yeah, I've always
wanted to do stand up like that in Maya.

676
00:44:13,011 --> 00:44:16,730
Was your reaction in my, yeah, in my,
ever since I was a kid, I was like,

677
00:44:16,731 --> 00:44:21,410
the goal is to be, do stand up. Oh
yeah, 100%. But it was always like,

678
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:25,640
I was always like, and I didn't know how
dumb that was. This was then, but like,

679
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:29,990
I was like, I'll get in, I'll get famous
first, which is like, everyone would hate,

680
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,980
hate me. Oh, I know. I

681
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,980
know. I know a few people you're talking
about comics would hate you. Yeah.

682
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,480
But yeah, no, that's like
the worst thing to do is,

683
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:44,790
is just you gotta you gotta you know,
grind and, and hit the trenches. Yeah.

684
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:48,840
But, but, um, but so, so I,

685
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:53,220
so Stephanie was like my literary
manager and she was like, um,

686
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:55,350
she was like try standup and I tried,

687
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:59,820
I did stand up and I did it for a few
months and because I was at this point,

688
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:03,510
because also my things that were getting
optioned, none of it was getting made,

689
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,120
so I was like, oh, this your writing
screenplays or yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

690
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:10,360
Like I had a movie, uh, Kevin Spacey was
going to produce it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

691
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:12,740
You must have been like, fuck, I was 22.

692
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:17,840
Oh my God. Yeah. And did you have, did
you, I was wondering this like, did you,

693
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:21,940
because your dad was in the, as
a director, yeah. Did you had,

694
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,980
had you read just dozens and dozens
of scripts, so you kind of, yeah,

695
00:45:24,981 --> 00:45:27,220
I grew up in it. Yeah. So I
knew what it was all about.

696
00:45:27,221 --> 00:45:29,040
What a shit script was and yeah,
yeah.

697
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:33,870
But also, but also like,
uh, like you know how like,

698
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:36,720
you know, I go up so much,
I do stand up so much,

699
00:45:36,721 --> 00:45:39,240
like when I'm focused on
something, I'm like, I would,

700
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:43,650
I would literally sit and write for eight

701
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:48,550
hours a day. Yeah. I know. I can't
even fucking believe I did that.

702
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:52,180
Do you still do this ever? No, cause
it, cause it's all about stand up now.

703
00:45:52,181 --> 00:45:54,730
You know what I mean? Like I,
I like if I'm pitching a show,

704
00:45:54,731 --> 00:45:57,760
like I'll develop the idea and shit,
but I'm never like, I'm never like,

705
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:59,800
I'm always like, oh, I got
a show tonight. You know,

706
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:03,790
I don't want to do this new joke or, or,
or develop this or say this new thing.

707
00:46:03,791 --> 00:46:06,880
So it's more like I'm about your energy
and just, yeah, exactly. My energy. Yeah.

708
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:11,680
Can I just say, I'm so impressed with
your, you're such a great performer.

709
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:14,590
You're always up great.
You're always great on stage.

710
00:46:14,591 --> 00:46:18,700
When I see like a pop at the store and
I'll see you doing but an television too,

711
00:46:18,701 --> 00:46:22,300
like you've done these sitcoms
and I'm always blown away,

712
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:25,810
hey you look great on camera
and B you can deliver.

713
00:46:25,811 --> 00:46:30,520
Sometimes these jokes that like are not
technically hard jokes and they're funny

714
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:33,060
and you're like how fucking hard is that?

715
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:37,450
Because I took a Sitcom act in
class recently and it's really hard.

716
00:46:37,451 --> 00:46:40,540
It's not easy to do sit calm acting.
Yeah. Well first of all thanks.

717
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:44,690
I feel like, uh, um, I feel like it,

718
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,920
the thing I, you know, I don't
know, but I think that it's, it's,

719
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,440
it's totally different.
Like it's just, it's not,

720
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:53,030
I think when you try to bring the same,

721
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:54,640
like I was talking about
this like cause comedian,

722
00:46:54,641 --> 00:46:56,900
because comedians will be like ha,
cause they'll talk,

723
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,400
they'll ask me about like social media.
They'll be like,

724
00:46:58,401 --> 00:46:59,570
how did you get a following and shit.

725
00:46:59,571 --> 00:47:04,571
Like you can't like do the
same tone on different mediums.

726
00:47:05,511 --> 00:47:07,550
You know what I mean?
Like, like if you're, yeah,

727
00:47:07,551 --> 00:47:10,130
if you're a comedian
on stage doing standup,

728
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:15,120
like that's not the same thing as being
a character in a show on a sick. I'm,

729
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:17,300
even though there's an audience there,
and I always think about this like,

730
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:20,990
like when you're shooting is especially
for me because I'm real animated on

731
00:47:20,991 --> 00:47:25,310
stage. Yeah. But like when I go in, I do
a show in the car at the comedy store,

732
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:29,680
um, I know there's people in the fucking
back. Yeah. You know what I mean?

733
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:31,810
So I can be as animated
as I as I need to be,

734
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:33,670
but like when I'm shooting a special,

735
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,760
I always have it in the back of my
mind that most people are going to be

736
00:47:36,761 --> 00:47:41,410
watching this on their fucking TV.
So I don't really change much.

737
00:47:41,411 --> 00:47:45,280
But like I know I,
in the back of my head I'm like,

738
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:49,540
there will be close ups. So like you
can't like put, like I've seen Comedians,

739
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,930
I've seen comedians who I fucking love.

740
00:47:52,931 --> 00:47:57,250
I think some of the top comedians
and their specials, just, they,

741
00:47:57,290 --> 00:48:00,340
they're just like excited that they're
doing the special and you can see it on

742
00:48:00,341 --> 00:48:03,270
their fucking face, on the clothes. It's
two minute and it doesn't, it, yeah,

743
00:48:03,271 --> 00:48:08,050
it's not their best performance. And so
even in standup it's a different thing.

744
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,410
Like if you're shooting something,
so if you're doing something as a,

745
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:15,310
an actor on a sitcom or, or even
if you're on a show, you know,

746
00:48:15,311 --> 00:48:17,770
some drama or whatever the fuck it is,
it's all different.

747
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,060
And even on social media,

748
00:48:19,061 --> 00:48:22,630
like you can't do the same shit you do
on stage on like, you know what I mean?

749
00:48:22,631 --> 00:48:24,400
Like it's all different.
It's all different.

750
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:28,330
So I think that when you try to bring
the same energy but just doesn't work.

751
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:32,050
We were talking about acting in a
comedy versus drama and you're like,

752
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,170
you said that the dramas are the worst
because like you're there all day and

753
00:48:35,171 --> 00:48:38,650
then you're like, hey, what
I cut. And like that's,

754
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:43,000
that's the fun of the show.
Yeah, it's, it's a, it's,

755
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:47,520
it's really like, I mean, when you're
doing a comedy like you do, you,

756
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:49,810
you're literally like, I don't know, man,

757
00:48:49,811 --> 00:48:52,720
when I shot this movie
called Flocka dudes and uh,

758
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:56,450
it was with like all of these
great comedians that are, you know,

759
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:00,850
like a CML Hannibal. Uh, I mean, Brett
Gelman was in it. It was just, we were,

760
00:49:00,851 --> 00:49:04,720
we were crying, laughing,
shooting the fucking movie and um,

761
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,160
and then you do like a drama,
like, you know, I mean,

762
00:49:09,161 --> 00:49:11,290
I was on the good doctor last
year and it was just like,

763
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:16,590
you don't have that every
time you do a take on,

764
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:20,170
on a comedy, it's like you find out, oh,
this is funny too. I'll just this funny,

765
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,450
we'll do it again. This is funny
until you do it seven times, whatever.

766
00:49:22,451 --> 00:49:27,130
It's so funny every time. But you know,
I'm talking to this doctor about like,

767
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,540
I'm the doctor, his neighbor,
and I'm like, oh cool. Yeah.
So how was work? It's like,

768
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,870
yeah, it's like you got, if you're
not, unless you're doing like a real,

769
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:38,590
like the doctor role is cool. You know
what I mean? Like, cause he's like,

770
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:43,000
it feeds them artistically and he's
playing this real role and he's got like,

771
00:49:43,001 --> 00:49:46,290
but like when you're the
neighbor in a drama. Yeah.

772
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:52,390
Yeah. And, and, and I, I did
this, this movie every week to,

773
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:55,540
that's what I said. I actually
started doing it on stage. Like my,

774
00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:01,170
I started talking about how like my worst
nightmare job is to be on like CSI and

775
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:06,520
for eight seasons be Rich's shit,
but be that fucking guy where you're like,

776
00:50:06,521 --> 00:50:10,600
I'm way I had to type in. And you
know what I mean? Blow my brains out.

777
00:50:10,601 --> 00:50:13,000
I flew with a,
what's the guy that played a,

778
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:16,390
Chris Noth played Mr. Bailey
and that sex in the city.

779
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:20,890
So we were talking all about this stuff
and he goes, he said, um, he's like,

780
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:25,210
he's like, you know, that role is like,
it was fine or whatever. And then he goes,

781
00:50:25,211 --> 00:50:28,110
um, he was on law and yeah. Yeah.

782
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,490
How was, how did you like
that? He goes, well, he's like,

783
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:34,130
it gave me a lot of financial security,
but he's like,

784
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:39,530
every week it's the same print.
And you just go like, you're like,

785
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,120
we need to talk to that guy now.

786
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:49,550
You walk in and you're like, sit down. And
he's like, it's just repeat every week.

787
00:50:49,551 --> 00:50:51,680
He's like, there's nothing there. He's
like, you know what I want to be on.

788
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:54,350
It was like Downton Abbey.
That's what he, he was like,

789
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:57,620
you know where there's like actual
real things happening. There's a,

790
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,770
there's the drama swells and
the stakes like, and he's like,

791
00:51:00,771 --> 00:51:03,490
it's just like brilliant writing and he's
like this law and order bullshit man.

792
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:09,200
And then he got, he got
mad at the, uh, there's a,

793
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:13,280
there's a lot of flight attendant who
freaked out that he was on the plane cause

794
00:51:13,281 --> 00:51:17,200
like, you know, women and she saw me,

795
00:51:17,201 --> 00:51:21,750
she started to shake and he was
like, God dammit. I was like, oh.

796
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:26,180
He's like, he's like, not with American
Airlines. This is fucking Delta Bullshit.

797
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,640
They're, they're obviously not
professional. When she did that,

798
00:51:28,641 --> 00:51:31,460
he should have just
said, sit down, sit down.

799
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:36,890
And then they're asking him for pictures
and he's like some professional, oh,

800
00:51:36,891 --> 00:51:41,870
the actual, that's hilarious.
Tenants take a picture. I don't,

801
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:45,620
we were talking about this, me and
you. We don't cause Burt likes it.

802
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:48,590
What were we talking about? When people
come up we don't like it. Right? Yeah.

803
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,690
I'm just not writing me to speak
for you, but I'm like, first of all,

804
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:57,230
I'm super nice to everybody. Of course.
Like anybody says anything to me.

805
00:51:57,290 --> 00:52:00,770
I'm always nice. Of course.
I'm saying that he relishes

806
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:03,723
the courts.
It,

807
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:08,750
we went to the national championship
game with a Ari and men.

808
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,450
People will be like, hey Burt. He'd
be like, do you want a picture?

809
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:16,390
Ask them if they want to take a pic.
And then they'd be like, all right.

810
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:21,440
You would be like, like,
yeah. So it was totally,

811
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:26,810
I don't like is that because it ends up
on the Internet and you look like Shit

812
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,370
for a minute? You know what
I mean? I never think of it.

813
00:52:29,371 --> 00:52:33,410
That's I guess for a
woman to fucking Yvonne,

814
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:38,390
I'm always just like, I don't,
I don't, I don't know what is.

815
00:52:38,391 --> 00:52:42,260
Um,
I'm putting expectations of the person,

816
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:46,820
I'm assuming them.
So I'm always like wondering where,

817
00:52:46,821 --> 00:52:50,450
where you're expecting this to go? In
other words like, oh like you know,

818
00:52:50,451 --> 00:52:53,960
sometimes I'll walk in, they're like, come
have a drink with us. I'll be like, yeah,

819
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:59,930
yeah, yeah. You're a
stranger. Yeah. I'm just,

820
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:02,930
I'm just going to say this is the one
of the first things you learn. No.

821
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:07,910
Well I'm Burt will like invite people
back to his hotel. I'm at the Hyatt.

822
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:09,570
That's cool.
Yeah.

823
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:14,450
One time he did it to the
audience of the show. He was like,

824
00:53:14,451 --> 00:53:16,010
there was a performing and he's like,

825
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:20,960
oh so if you guys want to come
and they came in like drove.

826
00:53:20,961 --> 00:53:24,820
Oh my. Especially cause they like we
can party with the party guy. Yeah,

827
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,160
well that's the whole brand.

828
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:29,760
Then the bartender was like out
of shit. Like what? We're not,

829
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:34,290
we don't even have the alcohol anymore
dude. I like, I have like in my head,

830
00:53:34,291 --> 00:53:38,460
I have like, I like these rules
where it's like, first of all,

831
00:53:38,461 --> 00:53:42,090
I think I was telling you, I don't
know what it is with me, but I think,

832
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,040
and this is not an exaggeration,

833
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,090
I eight or nine out of
10 times they come up,

834
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:51,050
they say something insulting.
Oh, right, right, right.

835
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:56,130
Like they don't even realize,
you don't realize it. And
I understand, I understand.

836
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:56,490
You know,

837
00:53:56,490 --> 00:54:00,510
we lose track because we're around people
that we think are funny all the time,

838
00:54:00,511 --> 00:54:03,720
but they're like, oh, oh, this
is the only, this is, I get
to see a comedian. I like,

839
00:54:03,721 --> 00:54:07,240
I never have seen that. Right. Yeah. So I
get that they get the motor mouth thing,

840
00:54:07,241 --> 00:54:10,980
but whatever you wanna call it. But
like, there'll be like, oh my God, like,

841
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:15,060
like, um, man, oh dude.

842
00:54:15,061 --> 00:54:18,030
I always try to forget my friends
fucking hate you and always,

843
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:22,680
but I always stick up for you
like that and you're like,
and I'm, and I'm, and, and,

844
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:24,480
and so if that happens,

845
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:29,520
I'm not nice to you because you have
to understand that what you just did.

846
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,010
Yeah, no, I agree. Yeah. So I say,

847
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,670
did you just come up here to tell me a
bunch of people don't like me? Well, no,

848
00:54:35,671 --> 00:54:39,420
but I do. Yeah, exactly. No, I'm trying
to say, aw, man, but just say your stuff.

849
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,840
Then at that point just say, Oh shit,
I'm sorry. I didn't know what to say,

850
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:44,580
but that never happens.
They're like, no, no, no.

851
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:48,800
I just go and I know what time your
mind, you know, you remind me of like,

852
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:53,840
I'll be like, what? You know, you
remind me of who? That guy, uh,

853
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:57,660
from the hangover. I'm like, Zach
Galifianakis. Yeah. I'm like, why?

854
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,790
Because we have beards. Yeah, yeah,

855
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:06,930
yeah, yeah, yeah. You know who's
really funny? Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

856
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:10,830
That's what agents and managers like
to do too. But yeah, I don't even like,

857
00:55:10,831 --> 00:55:14,160
but there's also like little ones that
are like, that kind of irked me. Like,

858
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:18,770
oh dude, my fucking brother's a huge
fan. Can I get a picture for him?

859
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:21,660
Always. Yeah. Like, you know what I
mean? It's like a friend loves you.

860
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:26,010
He's going to be good. Crazy that I took a
picture of it. I always say, Oh, not you,

861
00:55:26,011 --> 00:55:30,580
Huh? Oh No, no, I'm not. I
like you too, but yeah, I like
to do cause della. But um,

862
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:34,770
yeah, agents will do like, hey, you sold
out the wheelchair and you're like, yeah.

863
00:55:34,771 --> 00:55:36,290
They're like, that's
great. Who sold out six?

864
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,230
I had a woman come up to me once
after a set at the comedy store.

865
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:47,460
I still to this day don't know what
she was getting at, but she said,

866
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:51,720
hey. And uh, I was like, oh,
what's up? And she was like,

867
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:55,980
you really funny. And I was like,
oh, thanks a lot. I appreciate that.

868
00:55:56,550 --> 00:56:01,200
And so, so far, right. The compliments
you really well. Yeah. Uh, she says, uh,

869
00:56:01,201 --> 00:56:05,160
yeah, like super real, super funny. And
I was like, oh, thanks a lot. Like also,

870
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,350
that's the other thing.
How many times do people say it?

871
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,430
A few times and you're like, listen, I got
it the first time. You're like, hey dude,

872
00:56:11,431 --> 00:56:15,780
you're so funny. Oh, thanks.
Like really? Oh, thanks. No,
no, no at all. Like, seriously,

873
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:18,380
I believed you the first time doing it.

874
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,620
I don't know where are you trying to
take this, right? Yeah, exactly. So, um,

875
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:26,290
so she doing that, she did it like
twice and then I said, oh, thanks a lot.

876
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:30,340
And then she said, I mean,
you know, and I said, uh,

877
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:35,950
I said, uh, I, I said, what,
what? You know? And she said,

878
00:56:35,951 --> 00:56:36,940
uh,
I mean,

879
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:38,800
okay.

880
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,570
You know,
you're not like,

881
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:42,810
yeah,

882
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:47,550
amazingly funny. And I was
like, and I couldn't believe it.

883
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:52,410
And I said, what? And she
said, no, no, no, no, no,

884
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:55,980
you're funny. You're really
funny, but you're not like,

885
00:56:56,730 --> 00:57:00,660
and she would do that. And I said, I
don't know what you're, what, what,

886
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:03,750
what is this supposed to go? And
then she, the way it ended was,

887
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:08,910
I mean you're not like Eddie Murphy.
Nobody's, that's what she said.

888
00:57:08,911 --> 00:57:13,140
And I said, okay fine. I said,

889
00:57:13,141 --> 00:57:17,700
you're just being rude. I get, why are
you pointing this out? Why their levels?

890
00:57:17,701 --> 00:57:21,360
Just say the compliment and then the
weirdest one I ever had it because it

891
00:57:21,361 --> 00:57:25,890
lasted too long and she kept, she kept
not saying things and I was like, Whoa,

892
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,630
come on, spit it out. But man,

893
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:31,620
one time I remember this guy came up to
me outside of the comedy store. Yeah.

894
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:35,640
Yeah. Cause Cause I, cause
I, he comes, he came,

895
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:38,910
he came up to me is a fucking kid.
He was in his twenties and he was like,

896
00:57:38,911 --> 00:57:42,900
hey man, dude, my friends fucking
always talk shit about you.

897
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:45,300
They don't think you're funny but I
think you're the fucking funniest.

898
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:49,920
I go like this, fuck you right
in his fucking face. I go,

899
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:51,030
fuck you bro.

900
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:54,460
And he had his phone out to take a picture
and I walked in and he was like, oh,

901
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:57,660
what did I say? He knows. Why
do you think that bothered you?

902
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:02,200
It sounds like the compliment of
like the hate you, but I like it.

903
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:05,040
That seems to be the one that, because
here's what it is, here's what, yeah,

904
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:09,870
because,
because they think that they think that

905
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:14,960
there was, they're saying like, you
know, there's that whole thing, like,

906
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:17,930
it's Kinda like saying like,
oh, that bans great. Oh yeah.

907
00:58:17,931 --> 00:58:22,220
I liked them before their album
came out. I liked them. They want,

908
00:58:22,221 --> 00:58:26,210
they want to be in on the, on the thing
that other people aren't in on. You know,

909
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:29,030
that fucking bugs the shit out of
me. Dude. There's one thing to say,

910
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:32,090
I love your work. Thank you. You're
great. That's it. And you know what,

911
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:34,450
the other thing, the other
part of this is that, um,

912
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:39,610
that is lost on some people is that
they don't make that same concession to

913
00:58:39,621 --> 00:58:41,990
their compliment to
other types of artists.

914
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:46,160
It's like if they saw the actor the thing,
they wouldn't be like,

915
00:58:46,161 --> 00:58:49,740
you're a decent enough access. They would
just be like, I love you. And Yeah, yeah,

916
00:58:49,741 --> 00:58:50,574
yeah,
yeah.

917
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:55,600
No one goes up to the
fucking band and is like,

918
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:59,590
you're kind of a good band.
Uh, there's another bay. Yeah,

919
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,760
yeah. We're also out on the
fucking patio and shit. Like

920
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:09,860
I was starting to bred her and, and
he was like, dude, think about like,

921
00:59:09,861 --> 00:59:12,650
if you love comedy and you're,
and you're like, and you,

922
00:59:12,651 --> 00:59:15,200
and you live in Iowa and you're
on Netflix and you're like, oh,

923
00:59:15,201 --> 00:59:18,470
these guys are amazing. You go to the
comedy store, you can just be like, Hey,

924
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:22,490
what's up? Yeah, it's true. It's insane.

925
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:26,270
Hit his lunch was saying, it's like, it's
like you, you go and you fucking see, uh,

926
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:29,130
you go, you go see Derek
Jeter at the fucking, you're,

927
00:59:29,131 --> 00:59:31,400
you're at the Yankees game and then
you're like, oh, hey, what's up Derek?

928
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,530
And he's like, Hey, what's
up? Let me just think.

929
00:59:33,531 --> 00:59:36,230
I'm trying to think from the perspective
of the audience member who's like, Hey,

930
00:59:36,231 --> 00:59:38,840
my friends don't like you.
I think they're trying to be like,

931
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:42,180
just wanting to know I'm going
against all odds here. Like, yeah,

932
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:44,660
I'm kind of telling my
friends to go fuck themselves.

933
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,630
That's how much I'm going to bat for you.
You're that guy,

934
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:50,060
a positive way of thinking about it.
However,

935
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:54,470
you have to understand that that's
not how it's going to come across.

936
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,920
He's right though. I mean,
you know Delhi's right? You're
actually right to, yeah,

937
00:59:57,921 --> 01:00:00,680
you're right. But I'm trying to think
like why would someone would be like that?

938
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:03,710
Cause they're like, I argue with my
friends, I defend you. You're my guy.

939
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,300
Also,
there's this one,

940
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:10,100
there's this thing that happens in
people's heads that they're not even fully

941
01:00:10,101 --> 01:00:13,880
aware of when they meet a comedian in
that is that especially one that they just

942
01:00:13,881 --> 01:00:17,310
saw. They're like, you just
made all these people laugh. Um,

943
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,880
I have a moment with you.
Right.

944
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:23,360
And they want to say something either
really funny to you or insightful or

945
01:00:23,361 --> 01:00:26,930
memorable. And so they, they kind
of go like this, it, and they,

946
01:00:26,931 --> 01:00:29,840
it's a verbal diarrhea and
let you know I had one.

947
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:32,440
And Alcohol,
alcohol is a factor.

948
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:37,340
Comes up to me after this coffee
goes, uh, she goes, Holy Shit,

949
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:41,270
that was fucking hilarious. And
I go, oh, thank you. She goes,

950
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:42,290
but I'll laugh at anything

951
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,400
that makes me mad.

952
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:50,710
Great. And then her friends are
like, she's a fucking idiot. Yeah.

953
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:55,600
She said that thing don't I
got, no, no, no. I get it. It's
fine. It's fine. Yeah. I've,

954
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:56,870
I've had a bunch of those,
man.

955
01:00:56,871 --> 01:01:00,680
I've had a bunch of those that you're
just there just like you kind of want to

956
01:01:00,681 --> 01:01:05,030
go. Do you know, I also, my, my pet
peeve one is I find it super annoying.

957
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:10,010
It's like you walk, let's say, uh, from
a club into like the shit bar room.

958
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,760
Most people are gone.
There's people you always,

959
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:16,520
or maybe it's like the hotel across the
street and like somebody will be like,

960
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:19,450
oh. They're like, yeah,
they go pretty funny.

961
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:24,020
Oh, bad. Rude. That, I don't
know. I acknowledge that.

962
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:28,430
I'll be like, yeah, that drives me nuts
because it's like, Yo, they're in my head.

963
01:01:28,431 --> 01:01:32,420
They're like, I got shit to you. You know
what I mean? Like I'm good at my job.

964
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:33,980
Like, oh, you're cool now.

965
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,980
I just bought a ticket to see me and you
left your ass off and now you're going

966
01:01:36,981 --> 01:01:38,590
to be cool. It'd be cool. To me,

967
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:42,130
to me is the equivalent of literally
looking at someone and being like,

968
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:43,960
you're not bad looking.
And you're like, what?

969
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:48,960
Oh yeah. Pretty good. As so
dismissive. I get that from men. Men,

970
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,213
men say

971
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:56,710
what it is guys or girls and guys all
feel like you don't want to feel like

972
01:01:56,711 --> 01:02:01,180
they're bowing to you. Right. You
were like a reserve. I will say,

973
01:02:01,181 --> 01:02:04,380
I bet Chris gets it more
because he's your eye.

974
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:08,230
To me it seems like a lot of like
young girls like you, cause you're,

975
01:02:08,231 --> 01:02:11,570
you know what I'm saying? Like your
demo is, yeah, maybe like cuter, hotter.

976
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:14,620
Not like Tom was a salmon.
Mostly dudes.

977
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:20,340
I get the guys that look like me
and yeah, true. They have guys

978
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,440
that come to my show look like
they have health problems.

979
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:28,470
I always joke about, I'm like,
I've never see, uh, there's,

980
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:32,040
there's no crystal his audience. It's
significantly better looking than yours.

981
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:34,860
Like let's just, absolutely in
court would be proven. Correct.

982
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:39,690
So I'm imagining that you have these like
cute girls in the club too, by the way.

983
01:02:39,691 --> 01:02:42,150
Sorry. In the clubs. So there'll
be like delete was here. Whoa.

984
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:44,910
I didn't know we had people that
looked like that in the city.

985
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:47,430
That's what I'm saying. They're
all good looking. So the,

986
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:50,580
the guys must fucking hate you.
It's gotta be hate daggers.

987
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:55,160
I do get, I do get like
sometimes like the guys are like,

988
01:02:55,510 --> 01:03:00,510
like 12 like do dudes come out to see
me like together and they're like,

989
01:03:01,101 --> 01:03:05,450
we listen to you in the fucking thing and
are like, Oh God, they think I'm like,

990
01:03:05,451 --> 01:03:09,000
Damn. I'm like so not that guy. You know
what I mean? Like, but um, but yeah,

991
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:13,730
biggest stabilized. Okay. Do
you get into Twitter battles?

992
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:18,560
Are you talking about, you're talking to
the fucking grand slammer, right? Yeah,

993
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:19,730
cause I don't pay attention too much,

994
01:03:19,731 --> 01:03:23,330
but I imagine you'd be one of the people
that would engage. It's just my wife,

995
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:26,480
he doesn't lash it slot. People
say to me like, you know,

996
01:03:26,481 --> 01:03:29,270
you should really let that go.
You know, like people are like,

997
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:30,680
you're better than that.
And I'm like,

998
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:33,950
there is no fucking way I'm
better than that. I'm that good.

999
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:38,420
However good you think that is. That's
exactly the level, dude. I just,

1000
01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:42,290
my one of my faith and people are like,
you shouldn't let it get to you.

1001
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:45,530
It's not even that it gets to me. And
I'm not saying it never does. Of course,

1002
01:03:45,531 --> 01:03:49,730
sometimes it does, but it's, it's
so fun. That's the whole thing.

1003
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,570
I think it comes across that you're having
fun. Oh, okay. Good. Good, good. Me.

1004
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:55,100
It's good to know. That's good to
know. What's your, what do you, what,

1005
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:57,350
what turns this is what I love about it,
dude.

1006
01:03:57,380 --> 01:04:00,470
This is what I fucking love
about it because first of all,

1007
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:04,940
we live in the age of the Internet,
which is fucking bullshit. Okay.

1008
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:08,840
Because a guy who's not even close to me,

1009
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:14,390
who I don't know,
should not be able to say anything to me.

1010
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:18,920
That's it. The rule, he's not in
the room with me. I don't know him.

1011
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:21,770
He shouldn't be able to talk to me.
Okay.

1012
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:26,810
We live in a world where everybody
likes that can talk to me. Okay.

1013
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:31,220
And, and that's in my head
fucked up. All right. So,

1014
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,810
so the fact that that person
can just like, dude, you okay?

1015
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:39,230
And it's hard to do this without
sounding like a pompous or whatever.

1016
01:04:39,231 --> 01:04:41,390
But like if I, if, if,
if when I was a kid,

1017
01:04:41,391 --> 01:04:45,020
if I could reach out to like people
that I like, oh my goodness, I,

1018
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:46,130
that would have blown my mind.

1019
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,980
Like I remember I met Jim Carey once
and I didn't wash my hands for like four

1020
01:04:48,981 --> 01:04:52,190
days, but now people are just
like, let me just tweet him. Yeah.

1021
01:04:52,191 --> 01:04:56,870
You know what I mean? Yeah. You Suck
it fucking in this movie. But so,

1022
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:57,920
so now,

1023
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:02,300
so now the fact that
somebody can do that okay.

1024
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:07,040
Is and the fact that I can
tweet, uh, you know, whoever, uh,

1025
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:11,900
Tom Hardy, it's a, it's a, it's
a luxury. It's a privilege. Okay.

1026
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:15,260
Yeah.
So if you're going to be able to do that,

1027
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:20,230
they, ah, I'm just discuss,
nor is going to see, you know,

1028
01:05:20,231 --> 01:05:21,910
he's going to see this. No, fuck that.

1029
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:25,840
I'm retweeting it now you get to
see how my life is, dude. Yeah.

1030
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:29,770
I'm retweeting this and I'm
giving you a fucking, I'm,

1031
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:32,110
I'm giving you a shot or whatever
the fuck you want to call it.

1032
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:36,970
And now everybody gets to talk
shit to you. This is all dude.

1033
01:05:36,971 --> 01:05:41,770
What the fuck is not cool? This is my
life, motherfucker. This is how it is.

1034
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:44,530
This is,
this is that you've entered,

1035
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:48,280
this is exactly what you wanted and this
is what life is. This is the Internet.

1036
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:50,710
You get to talk to me.
Oh everyone gets to talk to you now.

1037
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:55,720
I always thought I was crazy too, when
somebody will talk shit and then they go,

1038
01:05:55,721 --> 01:06:00,100
ah, they talk shit. And if you put
them on blast then they're like,

1039
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:03,160
it's really not cool the way you shared
it with everybody. And you're like, yeah,

1040
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,810
wait what? You shared it with
everyone as soon as you tweeted it,

1041
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:10,550
it's the internet. The fact, the fact
they are freaks you out the most.

1042
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:15,110
What gets under your skin on Twitter?
Um, well here's the other thing. I'll,

1043
01:06:15,111 --> 01:06:16,670
I'll go look at my name.

1044
01:06:16,671 --> 01:06:19,280
I don't look at just cause I
want to see the negative shit.

1045
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:23,450
So I'll just type in my name.
I did it the other day.

1046
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:26,330
I look at my name because I was like,

1047
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:29,480
I can't wait to retweet some of these
guys and like talk shit cause they don't

1048
01:06:29,481 --> 01:06:33,350
fit because they don't think they have
like 36 followers and they're like,

1049
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:36,590
I'm just going to say fuck it.
And then I love to,

1050
01:06:36,591 --> 01:06:41,300
I love to think of them going to sleep
and then waking up and being like,

1051
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:46,880
what the fuck? I like having just replies
and then, cause I know, I know they get,

1052
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:50,300
I know they're a hoe.
They're heart beats a little bit.

1053
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:56,390
How, how laughter.

1054
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:58,920
I've seen you do it tomorrow.
People,

1055
01:06:58,921 --> 01:07:02,100
obviously the biggest one
ever was this Logan pool one,

1056
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:04,560
which I know you've probably
discussed as an ad nauseum,

1057
01:07:04,561 --> 01:07:07,500
but just to some people that
are not really asking about, uh,

1058
01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:09,390
that's the youtube guy.

1059
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:14,960
Young guy has like fucking
crazy and he has like millions,

1060
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:16,620
millions of subscribers on youtube.

1061
01:07:16,621 --> 01:07:20,010
Millions and millions of people
follow him on social media.

1062
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:22,600
He's a very young demographic.
Um,

1063
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:26,940
and he got in a lot of shit
obviously when he went to Japan,

1064
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:31,320
he was filming blogs and he made one where
he went into like the suicide forest,

1065
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:34,820
filmed the dead body and then,
you know,

1066
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:38,550
made his video and then people around
the world, we're just like, dude,

1067
01:07:38,551 --> 01:07:42,530
you need to reevaluate your whole Evan.
He know he went off for a while anyways,

1068
01:07:42,531 --> 01:07:43,321
so he's,

1069
01:07:43,321 --> 01:07:48,321
he tweets out that he has a video that
like everyone needs to see or something.

1070
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:50,820
And Chris just goes like, no, they don't.

1071
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:54,450
And this guy is like,
uh,

1072
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:58,470
this kind of goes right here.
Oh yeah.

1073
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:03,930
I'm laughing because I know why your
comedy career took a dive, which,

1074
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:07,420
so that's what this guy says
back now when you see that,

1075
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:11,660
what you called it on the top,
we come back.

1076
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:15,980
That's the name of the is we can

1077
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:20,630
come back. Um, so when you see
it though, yeah, you see it, uh,

1078
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:24,440
you're, you're, you're adrenaline's
going right? Like you gotta be excited.

1079
01:08:24,441 --> 01:08:29,270
When I saw that, I was like,
Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Like,

1080
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:34,490
yeah, I was like, so like,
oh, I almost was like, oh no.

1081
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:38,780
Like this guy. Like what is he doing?
So you had a very calm assessment.

1082
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:42,770
It was very calm. Yeah, it was very
calm, but it was excited in my, in my,

1083
01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:48,150
in between this and you w w
what is soon to be the greatest?

1084
01:08:48,231 --> 01:08:51,980
The Grand Slam. The Grand Slam of all
time. How long does it take it? It was,

1085
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:55,230
it was a few. It was not like
a few minutes to read it. Yeah.

1086
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:59,500
And then when you drafted it,
you knew you had a fucking I,

1087
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:04,160
that was just the one I knew how I knew.
I was like, that's just what I was like,

1088
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:08,780
this is what, this is what
the joke is. Like, there's
no like, that's look at this.

1089
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:12,840
So this is what Chris responds with.

1090
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:16,610
At least when my career dies,
you can film it and put it up on Youtube.

1091
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:23,530
Retweeted 150,000 times
and liked 665,000 times.

1092
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:31,400
All right. So I got it. I didn't think
it would do that. Anyone assumed? No,

1093
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:35,600
it was a good one. Yeah. I literally was
like, ah, this is the right thing to say.

1094
01:09:35,601 --> 01:09:38,900
It's funny. You know, I would think it was
funny if I, I imagine someone else say,

1095
01:09:38,901 --> 01:09:41,870
I'd be like, Oh yeah. Would be like,
oh wow. It is like when you know,

1096
01:09:41,871 --> 01:09:45,170
like when you've done roast roast,
most of like the,

1097
01:09:45,171 --> 01:09:49,970
like the real experience roast writers
will tell you when you're gonna when you,

1098
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:55,030
what the approach to writing a roast
joke is actually do the thing that you

1099
01:09:55,311 --> 01:09:59,780
think of when you think of that person.
In other words, if you're roasting,

1100
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:04,200
um, uh, a giant fat guy, you
go in there like if you, like,

1101
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:06,260
if everyone thinks of,
well that guy's enormous,

1102
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:10,320
that's the wheelhouse because then it
becomes a relatable joke. Right. You know,

1103
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:14,490
so if, if the person is, if the
person, everybody knows the thing.

1104
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:19,350
So that's the people, that's how he
was introduced to. Exactly. Yeah.

1105
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:22,480
So it's like, it's like a
perfect, that's great gross joke.

1106
01:10:22,481 --> 01:10:26,900
Cause it's like it's a put down,
but it's not like a two aggro. Yeah.

1107
01:10:26,901 --> 01:10:29,120
I didn't want to be person. I mean, I
guess there's a little bit personal,

1108
01:10:29,121 --> 01:10:33,590
but not really. But like I wasn't,
yeah. Oh Man. Great. But yeah,

1109
01:10:33,591 --> 01:10:38,120
and then I, and then I went to bed and
then I woke up and it was like, you know,

1110
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,090
200,000 likes and shit.

1111
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:43,220
And then like he must be getting texts
from people and everything. Yeah, yeah,

1112
01:10:43,221 --> 01:10:46,580
yeah. Dude. It was like doing the
tonight show in the 80s people,

1113
01:10:46,581 --> 01:10:48,350
I would be walking down the street
and people are like, hey man,

1114
01:10:48,351 --> 01:10:51,770
got you back from Logan.
It's like so funny, Dude.

1115
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:57,470
It was like a, but he tries to come
back and then I started to be like,

1116
01:10:57,530 --> 01:11:00,230
dude, I just like just like, don't,

1117
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:05,750
he's losing delayed. So I was like, yeah.
I was like, I don't want to keep going.

1118
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:09,020
I didn't want to really keep going,
but I will because I'm me and I'm like,

1119
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:11,060
I love it. You know what
I mean? You are. Thanks.

1120
01:11:11,061 --> 01:11:13,680
And how does it feel to have your name
finally attached to something fun?

1121
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:18,810
Oh my goodness. Okay. But
people, it was like, it was,
it was, it was not even really

1122
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:25,530
the credit goes to how much he,
people didn't like him. Right.

1123
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:27,880
That was what people were retweeted.
That's true.

1124
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:31,020
Not necessarily I made the joke,
but it's,

1125
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:35,040
it's because it's attached to somebody
who's done something fully unlikable and

1126
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:38,850
you're, yeah, but I mean, he, he was like,

1127
01:11:38,851 --> 01:11:41,430
he like people didn't,

1128
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,730
people hated him before that Japan Shit.

1129
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:47,780
And now there was a reason
where it was like, oh great,

1130
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:48,720
because you mean he would go in,

1131
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:53,100
annoy the shit out of people
and be disrespectful and
shit. He was like the, the,

1132
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:57,180
the, the Tom Green, but the tongue green
was funny. You know what I mean? Like,

1133
01:11:57,181 --> 01:11:59,040
but like what was like,
okay, but be funny,

1134
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:04,230
any like followup to this whole thing
and anything like as far as like somebody

1135
01:12:04,231 --> 01:12:08,370
reached out to you from that knows
him or anything like that or no, no,

1136
01:12:08,371 --> 01:12:11,400
not really. No. I mean,
he, he, uh, you know,

1137
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:16,530
I don't know the guy for all I know, he's
in, in the, on his phone just like, oh,

1138
01:12:16,531 --> 01:12:20,090
this is funny. I was just fine, I'm
having a good time, maybe years. And, um,

1139
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:23,430
if I met the guy and he was nice fucking,
oh cares, like I'm, yeah, no, I'm not.

1140
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:26,070
And like, you know what I mean?
Like if you do something fucked up,

1141
01:12:26,071 --> 01:12:30,220
which that was pretty fucked up what
he did. Yeah. Um, you know, may,

1142
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:34,290
maybe he genuinely doesn't, you know,
he feels terrible and he's, who knows?

1143
01:12:34,291 --> 01:12:38,580
Maybe he's a fucking reformed
good guy. I don't know. But,
uh, but like, I, you know,

1144
01:12:38,590 --> 01:12:42,750
I fuck up you fuck up. It's of course,
but it's like on Twitter, it's like, it,

1145
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:47,800
did you hear from anybody who you've
never heard from in like supportive?

1146
01:12:47,941 --> 01:12:51,370
In other words, he was like, oh
my God, like famous. Yeah. Uh,

1147
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,800
I don't know. I saw some people that
retweeted it that I was like, Oh wow,

1148
01:12:56,801 --> 01:12:59,890
that's funny. Oh, right. Like
bikes, I can't remember. I
can't remember who, but like,

1149
01:12:59,891 --> 01:13:04,330
uh, um, you know what? I
posted it on Instagram. Yeah.

1150
01:13:04,331 --> 01:13:07,530
I posted it on Instagram, the
screenshot and like, people like,

1151
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:11,380
like Steve [inaudible], Steve Urkel
was like, wow, man. Oh, like, yeah,

1152
01:13:11,381 --> 01:13:15,370
like that kind of shit. That's
great. Um, yeah, so stuff like that,

1153
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,470
people are like, I don't want no part of
you, man. I don't want any business with.

1154
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:22,420
Yeah. Like Dylan Mcdermott was
like, Nice. That's so funny.

1155
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:27,620
Um, hey, so give us your, we were
watching this. Tell your, uh,

1156
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:30,460
your assessment of, uh, what's
going on with this girl.

1157
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:35,490
I need some dick badly.

1158
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:41,090
I'm fucking tired of wasting
this good ass fucking pussy.

1159
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:45,600
Oh yeah. I'm fucking tired of it.
I'm fucking tired of my pussy.

1160
01:13:45,601 --> 01:13:46,740
Just fucking white spin.

1161
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:50,690
So do you feel like,
um,

1162
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:53,150
would you ever have
sympathy sex with someone?

1163
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:57,230
Like would you throw someone a bone
that you're not that attracted to?

1164
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:01,690
Well, she's attractive. I'm saying I'm,

1165
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:04,730
I'm relating something
that's not necessarily really
do this. I'm just saying,

1166
01:14:04,731 --> 01:14:08,790
would you, would you ever throw,
I don't know. I'd never have. Um,

1167
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:12,370
you never like, uh, you know,
not, she's not, but she's,

1168
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,700
cause that's not where my
brain was going with this.

1169
01:14:18,701 --> 01:14:21,610
And then I was thinking of like this real
homely girl one time on a cruise that

1170
01:14:21,611 --> 01:14:24,610
I was like, yeah, I knew it was
because of personal experience.

1171
01:14:24,910 --> 01:14:28,190
Some girl you bone on a cruise,
some pink, and then you did it.

1172
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:34,090
I ignored her. I can't,
you never told me this.

1173
01:14:34,091 --> 01:14:36,640
I've known for 13 years,
14 years when we got to bring it up.

1174
01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:41,290
We'll talk about are I want to
know. So was she real fat? Was she,

1175
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:46,750
no, she was just like, Eh, I want to, uh,

1176
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:50,860
she was just kind of like
lagging behind and I was like,

1177
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:55,570
I kind of want to talk to her cause she
looks broken and talks about what else,

1178
01:14:56,240 --> 01:15:00,580
what happened was the next day, uh,
when homely was like, kind of like, hey,

1179
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,930
I was like, and then, uh, and then I,

1180
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:08,130
I got a direct line to the one
on one to 10. How old are you?

1181
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:14,800
35. 36. I was a 21. Oh Wow. Yeah.

1182
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:18,820
Very that my dad was on the cruise too.

1183
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:24,420
No, he, well, he kind of
knew. He was like, he was, um,

1184
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:29,890
you could tell it was like
he was keeping it, you know,

1185
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:32,320
he wasn't being like gross.
And he was like,

1186
01:15:32,321 --> 01:15:36,520
it's funny like to watch you like you
kinda like lay back because he would see

1187
01:15:36,521 --> 01:15:40,150
me before he would go, he
would turn in real early, you
know, but he'd be like, Oh,

1188
01:15:40,151 --> 01:15:45,060
I see what you do. You kind of like lay
back and you kind of like assess like a,

1189
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:47,900
like a, like a Hyena.
Yeah. Yeah. He was like,

1190
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:50,411
and then he's like,

1191
01:15:50,411 --> 01:15:53,530
and then you kinda make your move after
you've assessed the room. And I'm like,

1192
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:58,760
well I'm alone.
I'm alone with my dad would call vulture.

1193
01:16:02,290 --> 01:16:04,510
I wasn't one of these guys who was like,
cause some of the guys,

1194
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:08,470
especially at that age, you know,
really like talk, talk, talk, talk,

1195
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:13,090
talk to everybody. And I
was like, wait. So, okay.

1196
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:18,040
So I was relating to you that I,
I've never, I've never done that,

1197
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:21,370
but I don't think, I don't think
I would. I Dunno. I Dunno. No.

1198
01:16:21,730 --> 01:16:26,380
So this animal though, she, um,
I don't know. We're trying to,

1199
01:16:26,381 --> 01:16:28,450
I was first we were trying to,
we were like playing,

1200
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:31,720
thinking about her as being real. Then I
was like, maybe she's doing a bit like,

1201
01:16:31,721 --> 01:16:33,760
cause she knows she would get,
but then

1202
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:36,080
I want to get fucked Neil.
Okay.

1203
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:40,820
I should be able to get fucked when I want
to get fucked. I work so fucking hard.

1204
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:47,450
I deserve to be getting my
face fucked right knee. Okay.

1205
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:52,530
Big Cock in my throat. Yeah.
Yeah. Suffocate me. Sucking dot.

1206
01:16:52,590 --> 01:16:55,310
You got to fuck tablet and fuck
who I want to fuck up there too,

1207
01:16:56,210 --> 01:16:59,090
but wouldn't that my pole whole
thing with this is like how,

1208
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,010
how are you having a problem getting,

1209
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:04,850
because she's doing it for views.

1210
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:08,990
I mean it's a legitimate request
for Dick's in her throat. No,

1211
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,130
I mean there's plenty

1212
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:13,430
of guys that would do that. I, I don't, I,

1213
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:17,150
it's like if you're going to be a slut,
BF slept for real. You know what I mean?

1214
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:22,010
Don't, don't joke around about this
shit because this shit is real life.

1215
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:27,140
Real slots get offended.
This is the game dude.

1216
01:17:27,141 --> 01:17:30,170
Yeah. Yeah. If you, you know,
you can't be all, oh, you know,

1217
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:35,000
go go to target and say this shit,
fuck my face. They're going to see Dan.

1218
01:17:35,001 --> 01:17:37,970
We'll see. Cause that's what I'm saying,
it's not hard for a woman to get that.

1219
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:44,330
I get you want you want, you don't
just want any guy to fuck your face.

1220
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:47,630
Sounds like she does. Yeah.
But if she, but she would go,

1221
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:51,140
I mean she could go outside and just
doing like a homeless guy or guys out of

1222
01:17:51,141 --> 01:17:54,440
jail or even guys that she isn't feeling,
you know,

1223
01:17:54,850 --> 01:17:59,850
it's like she wants yeah that is annoying
as shit cause it's sure for views and

1224
01:18:00,861 --> 01:18:02,960
all that and that,
that is just,

1225
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:06,260
I mean talking about the Internet
did to me that's what's wrong.

1226
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:07,840
That's another thing wrong with it.

1227
01:18:07,841 --> 01:18:09,810
It's like just a little taste
shit or whatever the fuck you,

1228
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:13,040
you've seen it a little tay. Yeah. Which
is like nine years old. She's like,

1229
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:16,250
I'm nine years old. I got my money.
Then you bitches. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1230
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:19,370
That was really gross.
Will your parents,

1231
01:18:20,430 --> 01:18:23,660
they're probably posting it.
Yeah, they are. I'm sure.
But like, what are you doing?

1232
01:18:23,661 --> 01:18:28,010
What are you doing? And then, and
then the, and then the, um, the,

1233
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:28,873
how about now?

1234
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:33,770
Cash me outside girl who saw
her on Dr Phil and was like,

1235
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:38,930
Oh, I want to see her rap. She
has an album now. 10 million.

1236
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:42,190
I looked at, I looked
yesterday, 13.5. Wow.

1237
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:47,060
Who the fuck I get like, you know, you
know, in 10 years are going to be nobody.

1238
01:18:47,061 --> 01:18:51,080
But like that's generous. Generous. Yeah.

1239
01:18:51,081 --> 01:18:55,310
But I mean like, okay, well
yeah, maybe you're right. But
I mean, I hope so, but like,

1240
01:18:55,311 --> 01:18:59,840
it's like, dude, you're the glorifying
the idiocy of America, I guess.

1241
01:18:59,841 --> 01:19:04,190
But it's like, it's so fucking weird,
man. That's somebody would look at that,

1242
01:19:04,370 --> 01:19:07,280
catch me outside girl and be like,
what else you got?

1243
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:12,400
You're a real talent.
That's so weird to me. No,

1244
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:17,210
it's too saying you wouldn't eff
that girl. We just saw that girl.

1245
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:21,620
No Way. That will be a fucking
insane. Well, first of all,

1246
01:19:21,621 --> 01:19:25,580
she's crazy. Oh yeah. Uh,
right there. She's crazy.

1247
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:30,110
No, because we see these
videos so much. Then I'm like,

1248
01:19:30,111 --> 01:19:31,670
I can't tell is it mental illness?

1249
01:19:31,671 --> 01:19:35,900
Is anybody that would put that on
there is a crazy person. Yeah. Yeah.

1250
01:19:35,950 --> 01:19:40,320
Well I haven't dated since the 90s.
Friendster was around when Thomas, right,

1251
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:44,360
right. Yeah. No, that, that, yeah. I
don't know this shit anymore. Yeah.

1252
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:47,330
I was trying to find this one
was getting it on cruises.

1253
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:50,930
Was it a carnival cruise? Might. It's
a real bottom of the barrel today.

1254
01:19:50,931 --> 01:19:54,290
And cruises are horrible.
You know, I went on to,

1255
01:19:54,291 --> 01:19:58,520
I had one good time. I was 21 and I
went with a girl and it was so fun.

1256
01:19:58,521 --> 01:20:01,340
And then I went on a fucking
cruise on a bachelor party.

1257
01:20:01,341 --> 01:20:04,800
I don't want to jump off the worst.

1258
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:08,200
You ever done the Gig on the cruise ship?
No,

1259
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:14,070
no, no, no, no. I came real close.
Yeah. Um, I got a call and I, you know,

1260
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:19,020
I didn't have that much money
and, and the agent was like, no,

1261
01:20:19,021 --> 01:20:22,420
you'll have to do like this
welcome aboard thing. Oh No.

1262
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:25,890
And then you'll have to
do like to clean sets. Oh.

1263
01:20:26,330 --> 01:20:31,260
But then you get to do one dirty set
yet to and yeah, but the good news is,

1264
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:35,880
and it was like $1,000 more than I was
used to making it right. And I was like,

1265
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:37,590
I think I remember this is like,

1266
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:43,460
and I feel like something came up like
an international gig where I was like,

1267
01:20:44,850 --> 01:20:48,000
oh, I actually can turn
this off. It was relief.

1268
01:20:48,001 --> 01:20:50,010
It was when I turned it down
I was like, oh my God. Oh Wow.

1269
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:52,890
Cause I wasn't prepared to turn it down,
really, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1270
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:57,090
They were, I was this close to
getting an offer to do Olivia cruises,

1271
01:20:57,150 --> 01:21:02,130
the lesbian one. Oh really? This
is when we were living rampart.

1272
01:21:02,131 --> 01:21:06,160
Division. Yeah. There was talk of it and I
was like, I don't know. I'm not gay. Am I

1273
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:14,550
exactly what I'm talking about?

1274
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:18,710
She us out to God.

1275
01:21:26,770 --> 01:21:28,230
Why is she screaming?

1276
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:34,840
Love to see the person just
shooting it. Just so like, man,

1277
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:37,060
where's her house?
I don't know.

1278
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:39,513
Nope.

1279
01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:47,840
Okay. But by the way, those people,
unless her parents are rich,

1280
01:21:47,841 --> 01:21:52,490
like she's not making that much money.
She can't know. There's no fucking way.

1281
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:57,500
There's not, it doesn't. I
like what, what it's like,

1282
01:21:57,650 --> 01:22:00,020
it's like these,
the girls on Instagram that are like,

1283
01:22:00,021 --> 01:22:03,470
have like 10 million followers
that are like, where they're like,

1284
01:22:03,471 --> 01:22:06,890
buy this tea or fucking coffee,
scrub body shit.

1285
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:11,320
It's like their, first of all, uh,

1286
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:15,860
their followers are all men.

1287
01:22:15,950 --> 01:22:20,510
So then they can't sell shit to ladies.
They're not making that much money.

1288
01:22:20,511 --> 01:22:23,530
That what does, what does, what
brand is paying her? Like what, what,

1289
01:22:23,531 --> 01:22:28,060
what brand is paying her? What, what, what
is his Windex paying her? No, it's brand.

1290
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:31,760
It's like, and there's no, uh, there's
also that's like the, you know,

1291
01:22:31,761 --> 01:22:35,300
the big thing is like, there's
obviously no skill set there.
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1292
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:38,720
Well, and, and I get, and I get that
if you're 12, who cares? Just like,

1293
01:22:38,730 --> 01:22:43,220
I want to watch that shit, but like this
is the, the, the following of a spectacle.

1294
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:48,080
You're just watching this, right?
It, that, that is just my God,

1295
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:52,220
man. You guys have kids.
It's like, imagine ever going
to happen to our kid. No.

1296
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:54,800
Yeah, no. I, I, I obviously, but I mean,

1297
01:22:54,801 --> 01:22:57,980
just imagine if you had that
kid that was like, okay,

1298
01:22:57,981 --> 01:23:00,500
I don't want to go shit girl,
she's going to be at the House of Blues.

1299
01:23:00,710 --> 01:23:04,130
That's the thing is that they all have
these tours. He's like, this girl.

1300
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:11,010
Nah, Bro, come on, we're
all going man. Nah,

1301
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:14,920
be just like the next day I'd be like,
I bought you eight books last night.

1302
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:21,520
Um, yeah, so she said, you know what I'm
saying a lot. This is apparently, uh,

1303
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:23,740
somebody who drops
everything like that a lot.

1304
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:27,650
Oh yeah. You know, we had our odd
man rush there in the first period,

1305
01:23:27,651 --> 01:23:29,180
which is not good for us,

1306
01:23:29,181 --> 01:23:31,760
but I mean everyone had their nerves
going and everything like that. And then,

1307
01:23:32,330 --> 01:23:34,490
which we're glad to just keep them
to want and everything like that.

1308
01:23:34,491 --> 01:23:36,890
And then we went back and after
a period in the locker room,

1309
01:23:36,891 --> 01:23:39,440
just talked about what we need
to fix and everything like that.

1310
01:23:39,450 --> 01:23:42,320
Stick to the game plan,
get back on it and everything like that.

1311
01:23:42,321 --> 01:23:45,710
So that's one up deep trance
and everything like that.
Oh, anything like that?

1312
01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:48,980
Oh No, come on. I'm coming
in here to the tournament.

1313
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:53,550
I got nice shot long text from him this
morning saying, don't let the atmosphere,

1314
01:23:53,551 --> 01:23:55,250
uh, you know, get your nerve shaken up,

1315
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:59,860
play your game, which is what I can
do out here. And everything like that.

1316
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:06,060
Definitely helped for a moment.
Anything like that, the big matchup.

1317
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:09,440
Um, it should be a great game.
I can't wait to play him.
I know they're doing good.

1318
01:24:09,441 --> 01:24:11,180
Only one last on the season
I believe and everything.

1319
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:13,393
I'm kidding.

1320
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:20,740
He doesn't know. I know. Here we did
it for him. Here's a bunch of your,

1321
01:24:20,741 --> 01:24:21,880
everything's like that man

1322
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:24,370
and everything like that and everything
like that and everything like that.

1323
01:24:24,371 --> 01:24:26,650
Everything like that, everything like
that. Anything like that, you know,

1324
01:24:26,651 --> 01:24:28,750
like and everything like
that and everything like that
and everything like that.

1325
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:35,270
Jesus Christ, I guess, you know what,

1326
01:24:35,290 --> 01:24:37,490
seeing that makes me feel a lot
better for people coming up.

1327
01:24:37,491 --> 01:24:38,960
Give him a backhanded compliment.
It's like,

1328
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:42,460
you don't know what you're saying though.
And especially, you know, with, uh, with,

1329
01:24:42,590 --> 01:24:47,070
with people, with the athletes period.
At any level. So like sometimes we,

1330
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:50,340
we expect a, uh, just a,

1331
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:55,670
a better a hero and also just somebody
to be as articulate as a broadcaster.

1332
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:58,740
It's just the guy that fucking skates
and bangs his head against shit.

1333
01:24:59,190 --> 01:25:02,370
And then he's like, and everything
like that. And we're like,

1334
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:05,780
how come you talk skin?
It's like as I,

1335
01:25:06,090 --> 01:25:10,640
I hit stuff and everything like that,
it doesn't know what he's saying. Whoa.

1336
01:25:10,650 --> 01:25:11,550
Is that a new thing

1337
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:12,403
and everything like that?

1338
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:15,490
I think so. Oh man,
that's hilarious. Well,

1339
01:25:16,950 --> 01:25:20,170
2016, man, that's
something that's so funny.

1340
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,400
His friends have talked that sock.

1341
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:26,440
Do you know what sucks if you're not
famous and then you become famous for

1342
01:25:26,441 --> 01:25:29,750
something that at least with like
you guys, it's like, oh yeah, but we,

1343
01:25:29,770 --> 01:25:33,460
I got a body of work, you know, might
know me from, but like, oh my God,

1344
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:35,290
that guy just being being the fucking,

1345
01:25:35,291 --> 01:25:39,190
or being the guy who like fell down
and got shit on his eyes are like,

1346
01:25:39,191 --> 01:25:44,100
that's your, you are being, I mean this
is a more dramatic example, but this,

1347
01:25:44,110 --> 01:25:46,960
this lawyer in New York who's a,
you know,

1348
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:51,040
he was like screaming at people for
speaking Spanish and like that. Now it's,

1349
01:25:51,310 --> 01:25:55,120
that's you forever. Like you're the racist
lawyer. No matter what he ever does,

1350
01:25:55,121 --> 01:26:00,100
he'll never get away from that white
lady who called the police on those.

1351
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,830
Oh yeah.

1352
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:08,420
And she deserves it. That's even
smart. People are like, well,

1353
01:26:08,421 --> 01:26:10,760
you deserve that.
You know what I mean?

1354
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:15,020
Like that's barbecuing with a
man that when and then when,

1355
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:19,040
and then when everybody went and had
the barbecue the next day, it was the,

1356
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:22,640
it was so that shit is
just did that thing.

1357
01:26:22,790 --> 01:26:26,270
But I think reminded me of kids where
you remember when like when you're a kid

1358
01:26:26,690 --> 01:26:30,380
you can tattle tale and then if
somebody or somebody goes like,

1359
01:26:30,381 --> 01:26:30,951
this isn't something,

1360
01:26:30,951 --> 01:26:34,610
that's how you get emotional because you
kind of know you did something wrong.

1361
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:36,440
Yeah.
There's a camera on her.

1362
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:41,180
Someone's filming her when the police
arrive and she's like, yeah, I know.

1363
01:26:41,181 --> 01:26:42,890
She starts breaking down.
It's like,

1364
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:47,040
I think it was breaking down because she
knows. Yeah, she knows it. She's fought,

1365
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:47,893
she's fine.

1366
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:52,680
But she starts to twist it
as I'm so scared. This whole,

1367
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:58,830
the meme of that lady or the funniest man,

1368
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:02,680
like Obama and Michelle Kissing
and she's in the background. Just

1369
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:08,240
the moons are the best. Uh, fuck.
The Internet is so great though.

1370
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:12,920
Never lose that shit. Yeah.
The royal wedding. We love
those memes that came out.

1371
01:27:12,921 --> 01:27:16,770
Like people were cutting
in coming to America. Oh

1372
01:27:18,390 --> 01:27:23,330
yeah. Oh, right, right,
right. There was that one. Oh,

1373
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:28,250
the cause it had the black preacher
and they laid, um, uh, what's his name?

1374
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:32,900
Uh, Arsenio Hall as the
preacher's audio and it looks,

1375
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:37,460
it kind of matched really well.
Very, I won't have Randy Watson.

1376
01:27:38,690 --> 01:27:41,800
Fucking amazing.
You know what sucks is like,

1377
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:45,680
I try so hard to come up with jokes
and be so funny and it's just,

1378
01:27:45,681 --> 01:27:47,810
I just feel like it.
You'll never be,

1379
01:27:47,811 --> 01:27:51,450
I'll never be as funny as some bullshit
like that yet. That's a skill too.

1380
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:56,520
Oh yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. No, I know.
I know. I know. Yeah. Fuck that.

1381
01:27:56,570 --> 01:28:01,370
That's so funny. It's pretty
great. Um, so wait, where's this?

1382
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:05,120
Oh, the check this. This is
a lady who definitely has,

1383
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:08,600
I don't know what the fuck is going
on with her, but she goes into

1384
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:11,243
Taco Bell.

1385
01:28:11,830 --> 01:28:15,970
And when's the last time you ate
Taco Bell? I know. I know the answer.

1386
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:20,500
I know the answer. Okay. I was 19.

1387
01:28:21,090 --> 01:28:23,410
That's a long time.
It was a long fucking time ago.

1388
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:28,030
And it was in union square
in New York City. And what,

1389
01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:32,520
what made it the last time
I ate Taco Bell, I walked,

1390
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:36,090
I ate it all at the Taco Bell.
I walked out and I thought,

1391
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:42,270
I thought I wasn't that, that
wasn't, that wasn't that good.

1392
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:45,570
And it doesn't feel that good.
And I thought,

1393
01:28:46,050 --> 01:28:49,260
I'm never going to eat taco
bell ever again. And I thought,

1394
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,920
you know how everyone always says
they're not going to do something,

1395
01:28:53,070 --> 01:28:57,150
but then they always end up doing it
again. This time I'm not going to do that.

1396
01:28:57,390 --> 01:29:01,980
And I haven't eaten it in
fucking almost years. It's been

1397
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:05,360
19 years because that resolution
to stop eating Taco bell too,

1398
01:29:05,370 --> 01:29:06,570
had it in Wisconsin.

1399
01:29:06,571 --> 01:29:11,571
After the shows in 2011 I drank three
glasses of red wine and Taco bell was the

1400
01:29:11,851 --> 01:29:14,590
only thing open. I hate when
that shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1401
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:18,600
And I had a Mexican pizza and a bean and
cheese burrito. Great. They're great.

1402
01:29:18,630 --> 01:29:19,250
And I want,

1403
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:22,980
I tried to sleep at two 30 in the morning
and I wanted to vomit all night long

1404
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:27,940
and I, I did the same thing. Never
again. Never again. Never again. No.

1405
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:28,913
Neil Hamburger,

1406
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,200
I don't know him personally,
but you know about us.

1407
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,290
Have you seen the Taco bell thing?
No.

1408
01:29:33,990 --> 01:29:37,040
He's one of my favorite social
media you're talking about.

1409
01:29:37,130 --> 01:29:41,120
So what Neil does semi irregularly yeah.

1410
01:29:41,420 --> 01:29:46,010
Is He will go on Twitter and
use the search function to,

1411
01:29:46,011 --> 01:29:48,520
and he'll just type in like Taco Bell.
Yeah.

1412
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:53,680
And retweet what people are writing
about Taco bell and it's all shit.

1413
01:29:53,691 --> 01:29:57,260
Like I threw up a of Taco bell.
Taco bell got me feeling,

1414
01:29:57,261 --> 01:30:00,940
I feel like I've been poisoned. I
think Taco Bell poisoned me. Uh,

1415
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:04,830
fuck you talking about just
puke Taco Bell. I do like,

1416
01:30:06,650 --> 01:30:11,120
it's amazing. It's funny.
It's absolutely fantastic. Um,

1417
01:30:11,630 --> 01:30:16,340
yeah, he uh, he fucking a man.

1418
01:30:16,370 --> 01:30:20,170
Is that him by the way? Yeah, that's him.
Jesus. I didn't know what he looked like.

1419
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:21,650
What he does that,
um,

1420
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:26,300
is he the guy that goes hamburger
knows that Hamburger Jones. Okay. Yeah.

1421
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:27,710
That's shit kills me.
Yeah.

1422
01:30:27,711 --> 01:30:31,340
I remember seeing that on def jam like
the first time I saw that I was on the

1423
01:30:31,341 --> 01:30:35,630
floor. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
And I was like, I also had
that thing where I'm like,

1424
01:30:35,660 --> 01:30:38,240
there's no way he's going to keep this
up. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1425
01:30:38,241 --> 01:30:42,290
And then I came to find out like
that's 100% is that, that's so funny.

1426
01:30:42,291 --> 01:30:47,000
Cause he doesn't curse. So every time,
really first he says hamburger. Yeah.

1427
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:49,670
I mean, yeah. So it's like
he'll never be that funny.

1428
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:52,870
I won't never be asked to Ham
Burger. They're like, yeah,

1429
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:56,240
I mean it's shit like that that makes
want to quit. I'm like, all right,

1430
01:30:56,300 --> 01:31:00,760
well I give up. Then we were
talking about, um, earthquake
doing a gig somewhere,

1431
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:05,210
and my agent, your agent to
was like a, he's like, man,

1432
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:10,630
it was like so devastating the
level he was killing it. Oh.

1433
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:11,840
He was like, you know, it was like,

1434
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:15,890
like the building was going to
call like fall down and he goes,

1435
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:19,880
you'll never kill that
hard. And I go, oh, I know.

1436
01:31:19,910 --> 01:31:23,750
And then I could tell he was like, I
mean, I didn't mean like you won't kill.

1437
01:31:23,751 --> 01:31:27,740
I was like, dude, I know exactly what you,
yeah. And by the way, I will never, right,

1438
01:31:27,741 --> 01:31:32,030
right, right, right. Yeah. I've been in
rooms where, oh dude, I went to, you know,

1439
01:31:32,031 --> 01:31:35,330
Donald Rawlings, right?
Yeah. Like just, I mean,

1440
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:39,230
planes could be crashing into the
Improv and you wouldn't notice.

1441
01:31:39,231 --> 01:31:41,030
That's how hard he's killing. Yeah. Right.

1442
01:31:41,150 --> 01:31:45,820
So I remember they wanted me to do and I,
I,

1443
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:48,500
I, I don't, it's not my favorite
gay, but I liked doing it.

1444
01:31:48,501 --> 01:31:53,210
Cause I know sometimes the students want
want like guys that they like and shit.

1445
01:31:53,211 --> 01:31:56,720
And I, and I know sometimes they ask
for me, but like the, um, the, uh,

1446
01:31:57,260 --> 01:32:00,060
the rose bowl shows at the
Improv, ever do those? Uh,

1447
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:05,050
okay. So I guess people don't
know at home, but like every,

1448
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:08,800
every year, whoever's in the Rose Bowl,
a football team, the football teams,

1449
01:32:08,801 --> 01:32:12,640
they'll have two shows, one for each
team. And they're always at like 5:00 PM.

1450
01:32:12,850 --> 01:32:17,780
Yeah. And, you know, they'll reach
out sometimes, I guess if a coach was,

1451
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:21,850
the coach will be like, these are the
comedians we want or something. And, um,

1452
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:25,060
so they asked me and, you know, if I'm
in town, I'll do it because, you know,

1453
01:32:25,150 --> 01:32:28,540
it's cool. The kids are there, students,
you know what I mean? Like there,

1454
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:32,110
so I go in and I, um, and I'm
like, who's on the lineup?

1455
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:36,270
And I don't even really ask
this all the time, but, uh,
I was like, who goes online?

1456
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:41,080
And they're like, Theo,
Danelle, a few other guys. And
I was like, great. I was like,

1457
01:32:41,081 --> 01:32:45,070
uh, she was like, um, this is the
lineup. Tg sends it and it's going to be,

1458
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:48,700
I just remember last year was going
to be Theo, me and then Danelle.

1459
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:53,430
And I was like, I was like, uh, oh cool.
Uh, I don't want to follow down out.

1460
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:58,180
Right. Yeah. Cause that guy just
murders. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but I won't, if,

1461
01:32:58,181 --> 01:33:01,190
if the lineup were to
come out and say, Hey, uh,

1462
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:04,510
it's going to be Danelle and then you,
I wouldn't have said,

1463
01:33:04,630 --> 01:33:07,690
can I go before Danelle? Because
I, I, part of me is like,

1464
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:11,920
I want to see if I could do it right.
Do you know what I mean? Sure. So, so,

1465
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:15,520
so I get there and I'm,

1466
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:18,670
I arrive and as I arrive,

1467
01:33:18,850 --> 01:33:23,530
I'm walking into the Improv and I
hear utter destruction on stage.

1468
01:33:23,531 --> 01:33:25,450
Okay. So I'm like, oh,

1469
01:33:25,451 --> 01:33:30,451
this is a great crowd because whoever's
on his murdering here from the

1470
01:33:31,091 --> 01:33:35,860
peninsula. Yeah. And, um, and I go up to,

1471
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:39,850
and by the way, Theo is fucking
hilarious. I followed Theo all the time.

1472
01:33:39,851 --> 01:33:42,790
I know how to do it. I don't follow
done all, all the time. Okay.

1473
01:33:42,791 --> 01:33:45,190
So I've never done it. So, so I'm a,

1474
01:33:45,191 --> 01:33:50,010
I'm on after Theo and I go in and as
the destruction is, I'm, I'm like, oh,

1475
01:33:50,110 --> 01:33:54,310
it's probably Theo on stage right now
because I'm showing up almost at my spot

1476
01:33:54,311 --> 01:33:57,190
time as this is happening.

1477
01:33:57,191 --> 01:34:01,900
The destruction out of the
showroom walks Theo. He's like, oh,

1478
01:34:01,901 --> 01:34:05,410
what's up? And I'm like, Hey, what's
up? I was like, uh, oh shit man,

1479
01:34:05,411 --> 01:34:08,590
they're running behind, Huh? And he's
like, no, not don Nelson. And I was like,

1480
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:12,370
Oh shit. So he got here early and
he's, he was like, Nah. I was like, oh,

1481
01:34:12,371 --> 01:34:16,550
so you're going on next? He's like,
no. I went on and I was like, oh, uh,

1482
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:21,340
uh, so, uh, there's only one
more comic and it's me. Huh?
And he was like, yeah, yeah,

1483
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:25,060
yeah, you can crush them, man. And
I opened the door to the Improv.

1484
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:28,270
Uh,
I mean,

1485
01:34:28,690 --> 01:34:33,690
every single all men 260
plus pounds because of the,

1486
01:34:34,470 --> 01:34:38,230
there were football team,
they're all standing up.

1487
01:34:38,830 --> 01:34:43,660
They're standing up going like,
oh, they're all screaming,

1488
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:48,750
jumping up and down shirts
like this and Nell is singing.

1489
01:34:50,110 --> 01:34:53,800
He's just like, it's
like, it's like, uh, uh,

1490
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:58,700
it's like the joke of a black
church, whatever it would
be. He's like, Nah, Nah, Nah,

1491
01:34:58,810 --> 01:35:02,420
Nah, Nah, Nana, Nana, Nana.
That's what he's doing.

1492
01:35:02,570 --> 01:35:03,950
And they're fucking,

1493
01:35:04,190 --> 01:35:08,950
people are on shoulders are fucking
losing their minds. And I say, uh,

1494
01:35:09,350 --> 01:35:13,480
I go, I walk and read a company
anxiety, right? Dude, Rita, Rita though,

1495
01:35:13,510 --> 01:35:16,880
you know the Rita? Yeah, she comes up
and she was like, she literally is like,

1496
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,590
you're going to do great.
And I'm like,

1497
01:35:18,591 --> 01:35:23,591
you're only saying that because you
know I'm going to hit my fucking Dick.

1498
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:26,450
I'm going to you.
Nobody can follow this.

1499
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:31,490
I'm going to eat my fucking Dick. I
was like, just end the show ended.

1500
01:35:32,570 --> 01:35:36,680
But, but part of me is
like, ah, fuck it. I'm like,

1501
01:35:36,681 --> 01:35:40,100
I haven't bombed in a while. Fuck it.
I'll just go bomb. Who gives a shit?

1502
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:42,920
But then like, you don't want these key,
you want to like make these kids happy,

1503
01:35:42,921 --> 01:35:47,780
you know? So it's like, ah, how fucking go
up. And Theo was like, oh, you know what,

1504
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:51,470
open up with that, uh, thing about
how, because it was happening.

1505
01:35:51,471 --> 01:35:53,210
I used to have a bit about
how one black people laugh,

1506
01:35:53,211 --> 01:35:57,270
they relu locate and know to get up
and they move around. Totally do that.

1507
01:35:57,470 --> 01:35:59,480
And that's what they were
literally doing. So I was like, oh,

1508
01:35:59,481 --> 01:36:02,510
I'll fucking open with that.
Thanks. The, oh by the way,

1509
01:36:02,511 --> 01:36:06,050
I haven't done the joke in seven years.
It was my first special. So I was like,

1510
01:36:06,051 --> 01:36:08,660
I'll just do that. I guess it's kind
of annoying that I got to do that,

1511
01:36:08,661 --> 01:36:12,530
but fucking, and I can't, I, you know,
I don't feel confident enough. But, um,

1512
01:36:12,890 --> 01:36:16,970
I went up in that, that bit ended up
doing that bit, did really well. And then,

1513
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,700
but then it like, it like
was like, I was like,

1514
01:36:19,701 --> 01:36:21,290
thank God I'm only doing 15 minutes.
Cause it was like,

1515
01:36:21,291 --> 01:36:24,850
there's no way I could sustain it. So it
was like, yeah, it was like he murdered,

1516
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:27,920
he murdered and it was just like
petering out very slowly. And I was like,

1517
01:36:28,190 --> 01:36:30,830
I had to do crowd work. I was
doing crowd work. But man,

1518
01:36:30,831 --> 01:36:34,370
I mean like aren't good at that though.
Well thanks. I mean I had to do that,

1519
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:36,530
but do it, I mean, I don't think I've,

1520
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:39,860
there's been maybe two or three times
I've seen something crushed out heart.

1521
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:44,990
I cannot believe what Donald Rolling
does. Donnell Rawlings. Yeah, I've seen,

1522
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:45,863
um,

1523
01:36:45,870 --> 01:36:48,810
now there's no feeling to,
especially when you're like, it's,

1524
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:52,760
it's so when it's like, this is going
perfectly for that person. Like, yeah,

1525
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:57,030
like every line and like the audience
has absolutely losing their minds and I

1526
01:36:57,031 --> 01:37:01,740
definitely want to go like,
no, no, no, no, call it. Yeah.
Yeah. Well I'm filming this,

1527
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:04,530
the degenerates of comedy. Oh
yeah, that's right. That's awesome.

1528
01:37:04,590 --> 01:37:09,420
And they added the six person and you
know how it fucking is Brad motherfucking

1529
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:12,780
Williams. And the first
thing I tied to Josh, I go,

1530
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:14,950
I am not following Brown.
Yeah.

1531
01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:19,450
He crushes like that to
where there's nothing. No,

1532
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:22,750
you can't follow Brown ones.
There's no falling that you see.

1533
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:27,180
There are some guys like that that are
just, I mean Joey Diaz, Joey to me,

1534
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:30,330
that guy too. They're tapping on
the same night. Oh yeah, go for it.

1535
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:32,100
He's going to go last.
He's got,

1536
01:37:33,130 --> 01:37:37,010
I mean like, yeah. Uh Fuck. I
met him one time. I was walking.

1537
01:37:37,350 --> 01:37:40,370
I mean it's funny dude, I've walked into
the commies store wants enjoyed Diaz.

1538
01:37:40,390 --> 01:37:43,880
He's just like, I know that
you're a fucking pussy and
everyone's just like, Nah.

1539
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:47,860
And I'm like, and I walk in and I
literally walk in. I go, oh for fuck sake.

1540
01:37:47,861 --> 01:37:51,580
Like cause I'm next. You know,
it's so funny. I love that though.

1541
01:37:51,581 --> 01:37:55,090
Cause it's so like I failing is so
funny man. You know what I mean?

1542
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:56,040
Especially when

1543
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:58,820
you're going to be the guy to
fucking eat Dale, it's coming.

1544
01:37:58,940 --> 01:38:02,250
You didn't know it's coming after
you've done this a while. Like when,

1545
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:06,300
when you're like looking
back, I feel like you, you,

1546
01:38:07,170 --> 01:38:11,130
you think of more adjustments,
oddly enough, earlier on for me,

1547
01:38:11,131 --> 01:38:14,430
I totally agree with you
doing like now if I'm like,

1548
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:18,570
if I'm after someone just lighten
the place on fire, I'd be like,

1549
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:21,790
I'm still just going to go up there and
it's either gonna work or it's not going

1550
01:38:21,791 --> 01:38:24,780
to work.
And I'm like a slow starter.

1551
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:27,870
So if I follow someone killing
lots of times people will be like,

1552
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:30,920
I don't know what you're doing. Like it
takes maybe for a few minutes. But yeah,

1553
01:38:31,390 --> 01:38:32,820
always been like that though,

1554
01:38:32,821 --> 01:38:35,460
is that you've always known exactly
who you are and what you're doing.

1555
01:38:35,461 --> 01:38:38,370
You don't adjust for anybody.
I don't, I don't address it.

1556
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:41,870
Don't make any adjustments.
And like people who like,

1557
01:38:41,930 --> 01:38:44,970
like my dad who doesn't know
shit about company and be like,

1558
01:38:45,030 --> 01:38:49,410
he's been to shows where he's like,
uh, how come you don't like, uh,

1559
01:38:49,470 --> 01:38:52,550
maybe try to make it for them.
And I'm like,

1560
01:38:52,551 --> 01:38:56,310
because I went to that strength and
that's something I wish I would've learned

1561
01:38:56,311 --> 01:39:00,430
earlier. Cause I, I'm the
monkey that's like, wow. Well,
I'm going to do it this way.

1562
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:04,860
How about this way? You know, I don't
do it as much now, but oh my God,

1563
01:39:04,861 --> 01:39:06,810
the hardest I ever bombed.
I followed a black guy.

1564
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:10,110
We're basically doing a black
guy compliment. But yeah,

1565
01:39:12,690 --> 01:39:16,680
it was a guy in Canada and it was all,
it was a Canadian show,

1566
01:39:16,681 --> 01:39:19,340
all white audience obviously.
And um,

1567
01:39:19,950 --> 01:39:24,810
his name is tricks and uh,
and in the, in like 10,

1568
01:39:24,811 --> 01:39:28,140
15 minutes into my set, somebody
goes, bring back the black guy.

1569
01:39:28,270 --> 01:39:32,910
Like they actually yelled at and then it
went downhill real. It wouldn't really,

1570
01:39:33,150 --> 01:39:37,380
really bomb. Like boo booed me off. Really
asked me to leave. Yeah, yeah, it was,

1571
01:39:38,490 --> 01:39:42,330
it was 2013. It was a week. I
always remember this detail.

1572
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:46,330
It was a week to the day that
I shot my first special after.

1573
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:50,550
So I just thought was so interesting
that like at the time you're a career

1574
01:39:50,551 --> 01:39:52,530
highlight during a one hour special,

1575
01:39:52,740 --> 01:39:56,860
one week to the day later booed
off stage later. It was after.

1576
01:39:58,470 --> 01:40:00,490
Wow.
That's a neat part about standing.

1577
01:40:00,510 --> 01:40:03,930
I know you can feel great about yourself
and then you can feel like a total

1578
01:40:03,931 --> 01:40:05,970
piece of shit then oh that's interesting.
Great.

1579
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,750
Like showcase of what standard it
can be to people. Shoot your special

1580
01:40:11,910 --> 01:40:15,680
with the special like with the
material that is your special.

1581
01:40:15,690 --> 01:40:20,690
Oh that actually makes me feel better
because it's like that's cause it's cause

1582
01:40:21,620 --> 01:40:24,120
your specialist fucking
hoe cause your hilarious.

1583
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:29,720
But to be that funny and then
to just have it not work,

1584
01:40:30,030 --> 01:40:32,450
it makes me feel better. Like when it
happens to me, you know what I mean?

1585
01:40:32,451 --> 01:40:36,570
Like there's nothing like bombing.
No one is never better than the room.

1586
01:40:36,571 --> 01:40:39,420
You know what I mean? It's
like, Oh the other, by the way,

1587
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:43,710
the other person who I've never seen
anybody killed this heart in this room.

1588
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:47,340
I've seen people kill. I've had good sets
there at the comedy Magic Club in her,

1589
01:40:47,341 --> 01:40:51,420
most of the rod man. Have you ever seen
him? Oh, I know that guy. Who's that?

1590
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:56,020
Oh wait, who is that? This guy. Oh yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah.

1591
01:40:56,021 --> 01:40:59,380
He was on last comic. Yes.
Yes. That's how I know he did.

1592
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:02,830
He did a couple of sets at Merck.
Really?

1593
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:05,770
Like the kind of shit we're talking
about. We're like, he's closing this out,

1594
01:41:05,771 --> 01:41:09,170
right? They're like, well now he is.
Oh right, right, right, right, right.

1595
01:41:09,190 --> 01:41:12,550
Shows can call this show
while over. Yeah. Yeah.

1596
01:41:12,551 --> 01:41:14,440
They did it to me when I was starting to,
uh,

1597
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:18,310
headline the Improv's is they always
put a black guy is my feature act,

1598

1628
01:43:25,241 --> 01:43:26,570
Here to do. The turn is gonna. Okay.

1629
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:40,540
Tacos and Burritos. So happy.
Cause you had four eyes.

1630
01:43:45,250 --> 01:43:47,700
Pretty good. Pretty good
come back or that guy? Yeah.

1631
01:43:47,780 --> 01:43:52,040
The girl who was asking for fries said
this is racism at its finest. Wow.

1632
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:57,100
And then other patrons of this Taco bell
where like they have tacos and Burrito,

1633
01:43:57,710 --> 01:44:00,440
that's what they have right
here. So you know. Wow.

1634
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:03,860
And now this girl is,
first of all,

1635
01:44:03,861 --> 01:44:07,460
she's getting emotional about,
is she on something?

1636
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:13,680
It's, it's either or. It's really a game
of like, is it mental illness or drugs,

1637
01:44:14,450 --> 01:44:16,260
which is a bad game show.
Yeah.

1638
01:44:16,670 --> 01:44:17,503
Yeah.

1639
01:44:21,190 --> 01:44:25,500
Every day you go to Burger
King to laugh at you.

1640
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:29,120
Good.
This guy's good.

1641
01:44:32,410 --> 01:44:36,600
Whoa. So again, the other,
the patron was like,

1642
01:44:36,780 --> 01:44:40,620
what did you go to burger king and order
to lap. Yeah. He's pretty good. Yeah.

1643
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:43,680
Which I love. It's a very
specific fish. He didn't say,

1644
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:48,510
he said to lap pretty good. Very light
fish too. Yeah, it is very, yeah.

1645
01:44:49,010 --> 01:44:50,270
I don't have French fries,

1646
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:01,380
French
fries to nothing to me.

1647
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:10,250
There's something else I'm going to
go mental illness, maybe not drugs.

1648
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:13,640
Maybe cause he doesn't seem manic,
she doesn't want it to illness.

1649
01:45:13,641 --> 01:45:16,870
It makes it less funny and uh,
I just want somebody to know,

1650
01:45:18,690 --> 01:45:20,460
oh, you're not familiar
with the show. Sorry.

1651
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:25,130
I usually doesn't deter us. Um, yeah,

1652
01:45:25,131 --> 01:45:30,050
I mean she's definitely going through
something. Maybe. Maybe it's a,

1653
01:45:30,140 --> 01:45:32,560
she's just went through a bad
breakup and she's just, you know,

1654
01:45:32,570 --> 01:45:34,070
that's funny then that's fine.

1655
01:45:34,310 --> 01:45:39,310
It's funny she broke up with her or a guy
who love French fries are always like,

1656
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:41,210
um,

1657
01:45:41,210 --> 01:45:45,950
and then here's the best is that she
asked somebody else if there were French

1658
01:45:45,951 --> 01:45:49,160
fries. That's what she just gave away.
And that other person was like, yeah,

1659
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:51,620
you're at Taco Bell. Okay. Now. All right.

1660
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:56,510
So if you were in the Taco Bell at this
point, uh Huh. What would she be doing?

1661
01:45:56,540 --> 01:45:58,920
You would be doing nothing, right?
Just watching ear to ear smile.

1662
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:01,340
You heard it.
Your smile.

1663
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:07,850
I would be praying that the guy
that everybody yell and be like,

1664
01:46:07,851 --> 01:46:08,780
I hope he's got something else.

1665
01:46:11,110 --> 01:46:11,350
That'd be

1666
01:46:11,350 --> 01:46:15,990
so excited. But you would stay.
Stay away. Stay out of it.

1667
01:46:16,570 --> 01:46:20,170
I think I would have to say something
like, let's say like right now,

1668
01:46:20,171 --> 01:46:22,280
because this turns like,
um,

1669
01:46:22,750 --> 01:46:27,100
unstable emotional behavior turns
me off big time where I got like,

1670
01:46:27,130 --> 01:46:30,460
I don't want to be, but I'm a true,
I'm amused at the people interacting.

1671
01:46:30,670 --> 01:46:35,090
If she said something really fucked up
or insulting, let's say to the workers,

1672
01:46:35,091 --> 01:46:39,160
yes. Then I would jump in. Right,
right, right, right. Yeah. No.

1673
01:46:39,161 --> 01:46:43,400
When I see crazy unraveling, I stepped
back and I enjoy, just make time.

1674
01:46:43,610 --> 01:46:47,310
If it's crazy, if I know it's
crazy, then I won't engage.

1675
01:46:47,350 --> 01:46:51,390
But if I'm like you, but she's
probably crazy. I won't say anything.

1676
01:46:51,391 --> 01:46:54,630
Fuck you bitch. Get me fries. I'd
be like, Hey. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1677
01:46:54,631 --> 01:46:58,100
There's no fries anywhere.
Even on the block, like, yeah.

1678
01:47:11,170 --> 01:47:12,003
Okay.

1679
01:47:16,230 --> 01:47:19,870
Yeah. Well she really handled it really
well. Really have the cashier. Yeah,

1680
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:24,820
she really did. Wow. Wow.
Wait, is that viral now?

1681
01:47:24,821 --> 01:47:29,450
People are going to be going in acid for
French fries though. Keep going at that,

1682
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:31,000
but yeah.
Hey guys,

1683
01:47:31,180 --> 01:47:34,690
go ahead and send us your
videos asking for French fries

1684
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,770
now.
Del Taco or Taco Bell.

1685
01:47:39,650 --> 01:47:44,380
I think probably Taco bell's better del
Taco. I, I've probably had in my late,

1686
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:48,370
in my early twenties. Yeah. But, um,
I was, have you heard of the Burger?

1687
01:47:48,371 --> 01:47:50,950
I don't del Taco.
It was kinda good,

1688
01:47:51,070 --> 01:47:53,740
but I haven't eaten fast food
and I mean I've eaten in and out.

1689
01:47:53,770 --> 01:47:57,070
But besides that clean, are you a
pretty, I mean, dude, I honestly,

1690
01:47:57,071 --> 01:47:57,671
here's what it is.

1691
01:47:57,671 --> 01:48:02,620
I eat pretty clean until
11:00 PM and then I just,

1692
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:04,720
I, I, I'm hungry real comics. I was like,

1693
01:48:04,721 --> 01:48:06,880
I gotta get something to eat because
what time are you going to bed?

1694
01:48:06,910 --> 01:48:10,220
Usually relates to 2:00
AM that makes sense.

1695
01:48:10,221 --> 01:48:14,560
So you sleep and usually I, if, yeah. If
I have nothing to do. Yeah. Like even,

1696
01:48:14,590 --> 01:48:18,130
even this, I was like, even this when you
were like 11 o'clock Monday, I was like,

1697
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:22,710
oh good. This way I have a reason to
get up to get up. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Yeah.

1698
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:25,430
But you have, you know, you
have a young, yeah, yeah.

1699
01:48:25,431 --> 01:48:29,140
That's all we've been making
fun of. Scat singing. Oh yeah.

1700
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:34,590
You know the scat man right out of the
things you need to do to learn to scalp.

1701
01:48:34,660 --> 01:48:39,520
Right, right. Listen, I'm
learning a skill, especially

1702
01:48:40,030 --> 01:48:44,050
literally even a skill, right?

1703
01:48:46,590 --> 01:48:47,423
I mean,

1704
01:48:50,090 --> 01:48:52,770
do you need to learn seriously?

1705
01:48:53,690 --> 01:48:56,610
And then my son does this. He's
two and a half. He's a pro. Yeah.

1706
01:48:58,710 --> 01:49:03,120
Wow. That guy is so serious about
that. Super serious. And now there's,

1707
01:49:03,180 --> 01:49:06,690
you know what hand boning
is? Uh, I know that word.

1708
01:49:06,691 --> 01:49:09,620
What is this guy's a ham boner.
Um,

1709
01:49:09,990 --> 01:49:12,510
and he also incorporates,

1710
01:49:12,690 --> 01:49:15,110
I think he incorporates
scatting into it too.

1711
01:49:16,250 --> 01:49:19,900
Hambone it's just going to anger
me. I know it. I'm like, oh,

1712
01:49:21,330 --> 01:49:23,660
it's the combination.
You're good at it too.

1713
01:49:25,750 --> 01:49:30,120
It's completely useless skills combined.

1714
01:49:30,690 --> 01:49:34,500
Uh, see the, the Internet people will
just fight. I was like, Oh, this is,

1715
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:39,120
you can do anything and just
have a fan base. Absolutely. No,

1716
01:49:39,460 --> 01:49:43,110
you don't know what this is. I want
you to be, don't be, don't be alone.

1717
01:49:43,230 --> 01:49:47,830
I've seen this guy hit her or do this.
I bet couple of minutes,

1718
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:52,360
his ball smell better than his beard guy.
I've seen this.

1719
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:56,860
I've, you know why I've seen this
guy. Somebody made a meme about it.

1720
01:49:56,861 --> 01:49:58,380
I forget what it was, but
it was really funny. Oh,

1721
01:49:58,390 --> 01:50:01,330
you can go fuck himself because I don't
think this is a fucking talent either.

1722
01:50:02,770 --> 01:50:06,850
Oh fuck off with the share sells more
tickets than I do this size, this place,

1723
01:50:06,851 --> 01:50:08,020
man.
All three of us.

1724
01:50:09,930 --> 01:50:14,450
Oh, for God's sake. Oh fuck
off. Oh, just hit them.

1725
01:50:18,270 --> 01:50:19,990
You're doing it. Whoa. Hold on.

1726
01:50:20,190 --> 01:50:25,190
At what point in his life did was he
has these old is this as career was this

1727
01:50:25,321 --> 01:50:30,170
was like he was the guy. Cause it
makes sense in 1930 right, right.

1728
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:35,200
Like you can't hear the instruments.
Yeah. It's good to have from the air. Yes.

1729
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:38,513
Yeah.
But it's not,

1730
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:41,910
it makes me so annoyed when they laugh.

1731
01:50:42,170 --> 01:50:46,700
Oh, me too. It's not a talent.

1732
01:50:48,660 --> 01:50:53,220
Oh No,
it's your drunk grandpa at Christmas.

1733
01:50:53,221 --> 01:50:57,090
It's not a fucking skill with this
asshole smile. Look how impressed he is.

1734
01:50:57,880 --> 01:51:01,500
That guy, that guy. It's
his fault. What will like,

1735
01:51:01,890 --> 01:51:05,370
I want to know what that guy
sees all the time. That, that,

1736
01:51:05,371 --> 01:51:10,230
that this makes him smile. What does
he see? Just war all of the time.

1737
01:51:10,530 --> 01:51:13,830
Just people getting hit
by cars his whole day.

1738
01:51:15,270 --> 01:51:18,810
People. Yeah, and then
he's like, oh, not war.

1739
01:51:18,870 --> 01:51:21,030
That's literally what he's
thinking when he sees that guy.

1740
01:51:23,370 --> 01:51:27,810
Oh my God. Fuck off. Yeah,
here we go. What's so funny?

1741
01:51:29,190 --> 01:51:31,110
You know what? Nothing. Nothing, Bro.

1742
01:51:32,910 --> 01:51:35,450
I hope we get shot at the end of this.
We think,

1743
01:51:35,490 --> 01:51:39,390
I literally think an hour I could do
in an hour. I keep going over this.

1744
01:51:39,391 --> 01:51:42,240
I can figure out 80% of it.
Yeah.

1745
01:51:44,060 --> 01:51:44,970
Oh fuck off.

1746
01:51:50,540 --> 01:51:51,920
Do you think you sell CDs afterwards?

1747
01:51:54,090 --> 01:51:57,270
Here's all right. Here's the grand
finale. Ready to receive those?

1748
01:51:57,290 --> 01:51:58,220
Graph it out himself.

1749
01:52:04,450 --> 01:52:05,283
Okay.

1750
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:10,170
All right guys, I have a question for
you. Okay. Who is more talentless? Yeah.

1751
01:52:11,150 --> 01:52:15,680
The person on Instagram who's just like
the model and then they do meet and

1752
01:52:15,681 --> 01:52:18,950
greets and they make like
Cameron Dallas for instance,

1753
01:52:20,010 --> 01:52:23,410
he's millions of followers and they did
these tours where they just meet greet,

1754
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:28,430
right. Or this fucking asshole, like
who is more talent, who has less talent

1755
01:52:32,910 --> 01:52:35,840
I think.
I think

1756
01:52:37,480 --> 01:52:39,120
we're just to remind you, God, I don't

1757
01:52:44,050 --> 01:52:46,290
like what's more personally,

1758
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:53,140
I want bonus in the group. The
ham bone. I'm inclined to like,

1759
01:52:54,110 --> 01:52:58,250
Cameron's a good question. The
Internet model like that. Okay.

1760
01:52:58,310 --> 01:53:01,520
It's beauty is in an eight thing.
You're, you're blessed with it.

1761
01:53:02,820 --> 01:53:06,620
It's useless though. Just like that
one's you, it's a, it's a good question.

1762
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:11,060
It's a tough question. Who's more talent
list? Yeah. Like who makes you angrier?

1763
01:53:11,090 --> 01:53:14,090
Let, let's go with the field. Well that's
different. This time makes me angry. Yeah.

1764
01:53:14,091 --> 01:53:16,090
He makes me angry.
But I feel like the,

1765
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:21,000
the cute kid is less talent cause
it's Keith all he said, but he said,

1766
01:53:21,001 --> 01:53:25,820
and he's handsome. He's a model. He
modeled, okay, let's put it this way.

1767
01:53:25,910 --> 01:53:28,070
Mumbling to scale.
Modeling is a skill.

1768
01:53:28,071 --> 01:53:32,270
I think it's what people buy tickets
to meet that kid to me. Him. Yeah.

1769
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:36,610
This people, people buy tickets to watch
them do that. Do that fucking fuck.

1770
01:53:39,550 --> 01:53:43,040
Yeah. He, um, I think that, fuck this guy.

1771
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:48,350
There's this guy, I mean I'm just
trying to find the argument here,

1772
01:53:48,380 --> 01:53:52,790
but this guy at least
figured out something to do.

1773
01:53:53,420 --> 01:53:56,510
That's it, you know,
um, the other guy and,

1774
01:53:56,570 --> 01:54:01,430
and trick people into coming to see who's
the real asshole, I guess. Yeah. I mean,

1775
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:06,960
I mean,
ah,

1776
01:54:07,250 --> 01:54:08,520
no,
no.

1777
01:54:10,130 --> 01:54:13,200
Three of us went like how we would
be crying. I mean to eat an apple.

1778
01:54:13,201 --> 01:54:17,520
Can you get through who's more talented?
Him or the staying alive?

1779
01:54:17,700 --> 01:54:22,160
Staying alive. Show Christina.
What's that? You'll see. Oh
yeah, that's a good idea.

1780
01:54:22,190 --> 01:54:25,390
Well, in the meantime, you
know, let's, let's go through
the logic here. See that is,

1781
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:29,650
here's the other thing, like,
um, Cameron Dallas, right?

1782
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:32,590
His name that is cute. And that
his day, United Day in those days,

1783
01:54:32,591 --> 01:54:33,950
a Latin those days,

1784
01:54:38,070 --> 01:54:42,130
even that I pay money
to see this guy do this

1785
01:54:45,030 --> 01:54:45,863
is here.

1786
01:54:46,860 --> 01:54:50,490
I think he lives outside.
Uh, but I'm going by the, uh,

1787
01:54:50,790 --> 01:54:53,070
the forehead lines and not all,

1788
01:54:54,240 --> 01:54:58,290
not all of you two feet. Can I tell you,
I feel like he's more talented than that.

1789
01:54:58,291 --> 01:55:01,020
Fucking I like this more.
Yeah. I like this was way more,

1790
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:06,000
put it this way if you were watching a
movie. Yeah. And over the soundtrack,

1791
01:55:06,030 --> 01:55:09,330
this came on be way more
interesting. Yeah. Yeah. You'd
be like, oh, that's cool.

1792
01:55:09,331 --> 01:55:12,180
What is this? Or if you walk into a real
guy, he'd be like, what does this fuck?

1793
01:55:12,181 --> 01:55:15,100
You walked into a room and there's a
small stage and this guy was doing this.

1794
01:55:15,101 --> 01:55:19,070
You'd be like, I know that song
and go, but if sold, I was like,

1795
01:55:21,430 --> 01:55:23,230
you'd be like, fuck this.
Got Men. Absolutely.

1796
01:55:23,650 --> 01:55:24,640
Well, but, but why?

1797
01:55:26,130 --> 01:55:29,650
He doesn't know the words down low.
Jajuan Bennett.

1798
01:55:31,770 --> 01:55:32,890
So I by no,

1799
01:55:32,891 --> 01:55:37,750
no [inaudible] United.

1800
01:55:41,740 --> 01:55:46,140
Oh God. But this guy,
this guy has got charisma.

1801
01:55:46,170 --> 01:55:48,960
This guy's got an angle.
The other guy feel like he's a hoodwink.

1802
01:55:48,961 --> 01:55:51,930
I feel like he's, he's been brutal
with me. That's, that's a good feel.

1803
01:55:51,931 --> 01:55:56,550
Jipped when I see this, the old fucking
wire, the intention is, and you know,

1804
01:55:56,551 --> 01:55:59,760
if he's doing it well, see, cause you
know the song, you know the rhythm.

1805
01:55:59,761 --> 01:56:01,220
So if say United,

1806
01:56:04,630 --> 01:56:08,840
you know what to say United. And so when
you hear someone singing it, you're like,

1807
01:56:08,841 --> 01:56:10,130
I like seeing you.
But

1808
01:56:12,290 --> 01:56:14,650
you don't even know if that guy's
hand boning. Well, like when he,

1809
01:56:16,330 --> 01:56:17,170
I bet I,

1810
01:56:17,350 --> 01:56:22,060
I guarantee you there's other
ham bonuses that are like,

1811
01:56:22,230 --> 01:56:23,660
yeah,
this guy fucking suck.

1812
01:56:26,230 --> 01:56:29,320
And then they're, they're more
mad than we are. They're like,

1813
01:56:29,321 --> 01:56:33,070
this is the fucking guy. Yeah. He
never closed with the Po. You never

1814
01:56:34,810 --> 01:56:37,780
know. There's another guy was like,
you know, that is my thing. Yeah. Yeah.

1815
01:56:37,781 --> 01:56:41,920
That's true. How long have I
been doing that? A long time.
Right? You're right. Yeah.

1816
01:56:42,010 --> 01:56:45,710
And then obviously you just go, you
didn't even pop on that one. Yeah.

1817
01:56:45,790 --> 01:56:49,600
But the amount of it, this is intricate
too. There's a lot of moving parts.

1818
01:56:49,601 --> 01:56:52,210
He's got to sing the song. He's
got to do the lung infection. Yeah.

1819
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:53,753
Part.

1820
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:03,740
What's emphysema?

1821
01:57:07,650 --> 01:57:12,630
Dr Juke came in and said it was, he's
got, he say was upper respiratory issues.

1822
01:57:14,250 --> 01:57:16,310
I don't think you need to
be a doctor to know that.

1823
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:20,670
Wait a minute,
how is this guy

1824
01:57:21,050 --> 01:57:22,570
that long and know what this guys,

1825
01:57:25,330 --> 01:57:27,960
but that's why it's so amazing.
He's a medical marvel.

1826
01:57:28,020 --> 01:57:32,330
He's working against what
he looks like the last guy.

1827
01:57:33,220 --> 01:57:34,720
Ah,
okay.

1828
01:57:39,090 --> 01:57:42,260
Stuff happens.
There is rhythm and he's like,

1829
01:57:43,580 --> 01:57:45,200
he's one of those guys that if you saw,

1830
01:57:45,590 --> 01:57:50,210
if you were standing there and you
had loose cash in your pocket, yeah,

1831
01:57:50,220 --> 01:57:53,970
he's doing this, you might be like, yeah,
hell yeah, but not fucking old there.

1832
01:57:53,990 --> 01:57:55,460
There's also a,

1833
01:57:56,060 --> 01:58:00,680
just on a behind his face,
you know,

1834
01:58:00,710 --> 01:58:05,450
you're like, you feel for him. Yeah. The
other guy is like smug and you're like,

1835
01:58:05,540 --> 01:58:09,650
this fucking guy. Yeah. This
guy you want, you are like, oh,

1836
01:58:09,710 --> 01:58:14,060
I can see behind his face. He's like,
maybe you know, I mean, maybe he's crazy,

1837
01:58:14,061 --> 01:58:17,240
but like you're like, I feel for
him, like he wants to entertain you.

1838
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:20,980
I feel like it was a warmth
or something. Yes. Warmth.
That's what it is. Yeah. Yeah.

1839
01:58:20,981 --> 01:58:24,970
That guy. What? This guy wants to put on
a good show. Yeah. The lung infection guy.

1840
01:58:25,340 --> 01:58:29,900
Yeah, but the other guy, the
other, uh, but yeah, the, the, the,

1841
01:58:30,620 --> 01:58:34,400
Oh, for fuck's sake, dude. That's funny.
Do you buy the, you saw that lady,

1842
01:58:34,540 --> 01:58:38,780
the Tim Horton's on the right. Take a
shit in Tim Horton. Oh yeah, I saw you.

1843
01:58:38,781 --> 01:58:41,890
I saw it from your thing. You
repost it. Oh really? Yeah. Crazy.

1844
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:46,240
You know what? In my head I was like,

1845
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:48,520
I was talking to my opener
and he was like, uh, what the,

1846
01:58:48,670 --> 01:58:51,490
what the fuck you think happened?
And I, I like, I was like, oh,

1847
01:58:51,580 --> 01:58:54,330
she's saying I need to use the
bathroom. They're saying, no, you can't.

1848
01:58:54,490 --> 01:58:58,100
You need to buy something. And then
just like the only thing we discovered,

1849
01:58:58,430 --> 01:59:01,200
first of all, you're right, cause
we looked at, is it? Yeah. Okay.

1850
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:05,470
But the thing that also came out,

1851
01:59:05,471 --> 01:59:10,471
is it the reason that they said no to
her specifically is because she was a

1852
01:59:10,751 --> 01:59:15,500
known problematic. So like it's like
she came in okay. And then like,

1853
01:59:15,550 --> 01:59:19,780
hey guys know that it's then it, yeah,
she's, well it's a crime no matter what.

1854
01:59:19,810 --> 01:59:22,420
But if,
if I didn't know that,

1855
01:59:22,450 --> 01:59:25,390
if it was just me doing it and say I
need you just let them know, I'd be like,

1856
01:59:25,540 --> 01:59:26,373
I would,
I,

1857
01:59:27,130 --> 01:59:29,830
my thought would be like I should shit
on their floor and then give him the

1858
01:59:29,831 --> 01:59:33,790
business and we'll see what's up.
Yeah. Yeah. So I could understand her,

1859
01:59:33,910 --> 01:59:37,960
but if she was a known person than
not. Yeah, that's crazy. She, I mean

1860
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:41,020
everybody has been,
we've been talking about this.

1861
01:59:41,021 --> 01:59:45,610
Everyone's been sending in

1863
01:59:49,910 --> 01:59:52,050

1864
01:59:52,090 --> 01:59:56,110
So this guy has a video that we play and
try it out. Yeah. Oh yes. No, I know,

1865
01:59:56,111 --> 01:59:58,870

02:00:51,570 --> 02:00:56,140

Well, now people find them for us.

1881
02:00:56,141 --> 02:01:00,340
It comes to us. So yeah,

it's been so much since
since that came in.

1883
02:01:04,310 --> 02:01:06,880
So what was the thing you're trying to,
people were trying to do it,

1884
02:01:07,930 --> 02:01:11,310
we want people to use it as a monologue
and kind of be creative with it. Like,

1885
02:01:11,360 --> 02:01:14,160
you know, an acting class for like
bringing a monologue. That's kind of,

1886
02:01:15,720 --> 02:01:19,760
so people have been just, you
know, doing their versions of it.

1887
02:01:20,670 --> 02:01:25,660

02:02:23,580 --> 02:02:25,660
camera. Yeah, I'll sit down. I'll send it,

1903
02:02:25,661 --> 02:02:29,110
I'll send it over if you want to shoot a
good though, I'm gonna use a real camera

1904
02:02:30,970 --> 02:02:34,930
and I would love to see you do it. I mean,

1905
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:39,310
people will become real dramatic. Like
a real interpretation. Yeah, yeah, sure.

1906
02:02:39,370 --> 02:02:41,790
I'll get to get it a lot. I get a live
studio audience. I'll do a sitcom actor.

1907
02:02:43,700 --> 02:02:46,660
Okay. Black guys who love to five black
guys like the fuck. Fuck good. Yeah.

1908
02:02:46,661 --> 02:02:48,790
Try it out.
Didn't try it out is really,

1909
02:02:48,791 --> 02:02:51,400
I feel like honestly the
guy was just winging it.

1910
02:02:51,401 --> 02:02:55,210
But I think that getting to the try
it out part earlier. Yeah. Yeah.

1911
02:02:55,300 --> 02:02:56,770
You know what I mean?
Cause I don't know how long that is,

1912
02:02:56,771 --> 02:03:01,510
but if you got it too with
like a 35 second banger. Yeah.

1913
02:03:01,570 --> 02:03:02,890
That would just be true.

1914
02:03:06,380 --> 02:03:09,820
Then you can move in, but you got a fuck
or moving. You're moving. You get fuck.

1915
02:03:09,850 --> 02:03:10,870
What accident is that?
We've been trying.

1916
02:03:12,870 --> 02:03:17,610
That's right. Cause we're kind of place
it is moving. It's east coast for sure.

1917
02:03:17,611 --> 02:03:22,450
Yeah, try it out. Try it out. Try
it out. Yeah. From a building.

1918
02:03:23,160 --> 02:03:25,190
Do you want to know the
big mystery? What? So we,

1919
02:03:25,240 --> 02:03:29,460
we played this audio for a lot of people.
There's one line where he goes, um,

1920
02:03:30,060 --> 02:03:33,520
he goes, piss on me,
beat me, beat me on me.

1921
02:03:33,521 --> 02:03:35,900
I know that last part,
whole minnow.

1922
02:03:36,240 --> 02:03:39,810
So a lot of people thought he was
saying how a man out like piss on me,

1923
02:03:39,811 --> 02:03:44,610
beat me homie on out. Whoa man.
Out Ho Ho Ho me on out. Like,

1924
02:03:44,611 --> 02:03:45,000
he's like,

1925
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:49,210
Oh hold me on out or Homey homey on it.
Oh homie on outcome or a

1926
02:03:50,380 --> 02:03:52,800
piss. Somebody beat me
at home, Ya know? And,

1927
02:03:52,860 --> 02:03:56,550
and then there was just like all types
of submissions to what he's saying.

1928
02:03:57,640 --> 02:03:58,900
And then we,
we,

1929
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:03,940
we decided that he must be saying he's
like rambling through it and he's saying

1930
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:08,050
home here now, cause he gave out his
address before. Oh piss on me. Beat me.

1931
02:04:08,070 --> 02:04:12,550
I'm like, you can do it
right now. No home here now.

1932
02:04:14,130 --> 02:04:18,030
Like, hey, a forensics on. Yeah, we
have resumes on it. I tried different,

1933
02:04:20,150 --> 02:04:24,500
it's like that Yanni a Laurel did
you find out? Do you know what,

1934
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:27,860
what it actually was being
said, but I know what it is.
It's actually Laurel. Yeah,

1935
02:04:27,870 --> 02:04:28,500
well it,

1936
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:32,280
well they say that if you're old enough
you can't hear the higher frequency and

1937
02:04:32,281 --> 02:04:36,600
the higher frequency he recorded. Oh,
recorded saying Laurel. Oh really?

1938
02:04:36,630 --> 02:04:38,010
So he on an interview, he goes, we

1939
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:42,540
said Laurel, but you're right in that
it's also a device. You Yanni, right?

1940
02:04:42,570 --> 02:04:47,100
I was 100%. I was Laurel, it was
a, and he said he's saying Laurel,

1941
02:04:47,310 --> 02:04:51,840
but the pitch either that you naturally
here or the pitch that your device is

1942
02:04:51,841 --> 02:04:53,970
playing.
So if it's a higher pitch,

1943
02:04:54,680 --> 02:04:56,670
cause I put somebody played on
their iPhone is like, wait, what?

1944
02:04:56,671 --> 02:04:57,720
That sounds like Yanni.
Yeah,

1945
02:04:57,860 --> 02:05:00,870
but how funny would it be if
he was talking and somebody
was just like, oh yeah,

1946
02:05:01,190 --> 02:05:04,310
Coz he's Coz again, he and they're like,
what are you a fucking lunatic? Like,

1947
02:05:04,410 --> 02:05:08,010
like I said, Laura, that's
insane. It's insane. Um,

1948
02:05:08,770 --> 02:05:13,770
Maria now in the building.
Yeah, he, it, he refers to,

1949
02:05:13,771 --> 02:05:14,610
are you in the building?

1950
02:05:14,611 --> 02:05:19,611
If you're in the building 2195 and
now I'm here right now I'm pumped.

1951
02:05:21,300 --> 02:05:25,350
Homeless or a thug.
He says men from jail.

1952
02:05:26,280 --> 02:05:28,650
I mean, he's born, here's my address,

1953
02:05:28,740 --> 02:05:32,250
men from jail and bring a friend,
which is

1954
02:05:35,670 --> 02:05:40,150
how is like sexual desire and preference.

1955
02:05:40,620 --> 02:05:42,150
You have no control over it.

1956
02:05:42,151 --> 02:05:47,151
That's the craziest thing is if you want
to get fucked by a bunch of jail people

1957
02:05:47,551 --> 02:05:51,620
in jail, and that's what
turns you on. Oh, well yeah.

1958
02:05:51,630 --> 02:05:54,660
That's how the cards fell. Yeah. You're
like, just cut it out of my brain then.

1959
02:05:54,690 --> 02:05:59,070
Cause that's what I feel. I
know. Yeah. Well, doctor drew
says it's a lot of trauma.

1960
02:05:59,330 --> 02:06:02,390
It's got a lot of trauma and he's
kind of, you know, dealing with, yeah,

1961
02:06:02,610 --> 02:06:06,780
but you're right. That's the hard,
the hard wiring with the trauma.

1962
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:09,650
That's a good sound bar. I told my
fucking intern and make it sound bird.

1963
02:06:09,651 --> 02:06:12,990
It's the fucking worst thing in the world.
It's a worst thing in the world.

1964
02:06:13,020 --> 02:06:16,410
Or really, you just click
it in a habit. I click it,

1965
02:06:16,411 --> 02:06:20,880
I'm waiting 20 seconds and I'm talking
about something else and it's like,

1966
02:06:21,510 --> 02:06:25,080
okay, I fucked by a black guy. Oh, by that
time I'd be like, I'm like, it's over.

1967
02:06:25,100 --> 02:06:29,310
Yeah. Um, all right. Uh, oh.
So I don't want to forget. Um,

1968
02:06:29,970 --> 02:06:34,380
just let me pull this up. Chris, did we
do, how long have we been doing this?

1969
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:39,180
We've been, we're, we're over the two hour
mark. Luba box. You need to come back.

1970
02:06:39,181 --> 02:06:42,210
You're such a great, I can't wait
for you guys to ask me. I'm never,

1971
02:06:42,211 --> 02:06:44,220
the guy was like, let me be
Parcast, you know, but I, I don't,

1972
02:06:44,250 --> 02:06:47,450
I want to do so few podcasts, but
obviously I want it to do yours. Well, no,

1973
02:06:47,460 --> 02:06:50,220
we're so happy you can't cut.
Chris is on a big tour right now.

1974
02:06:50,221 --> 02:06:53,430
He's doing a lot of venues.

can see coming up in a,

1976
02:06:57,060 --> 02:07:01,710
let's see the count Basie theater in
red bank, Wilmington, Delaware, uh,

1977
02:07:01,860 --> 02:07:06,750
Redding, Pennsylvania. Tulsa. Looks
like it's going to be close to, or,

1978
02:07:06,780 --> 02:07:11,220
okay. See Midwest City Dallas. They're
all at crystal IA that come. Um,

1979
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:14,280
how's the tour been going? Fun. It's fun.
Yeah, it's so far. It's good. I mean,

1980
02:07:14,281 --> 02:07:15,930
I kind of just started, but it's been, uh,

1981
02:07:15,990 --> 02:07:19,500
it's been good to do theaters again
cause I stopped, I did it like years ago.

1982
02:07:19,501 --> 02:07:21,270
I did a theater tour and then I was like,
I want to do club.

1983
02:07:21,271 --> 02:07:22,770
We were talking about this
and I want to do clubs,

1984
02:07:22,771 --> 02:07:26,840
but then I was doing like 40 shows
and I'd like a DCM Prof. Yeah.

1985
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:33,060
You're doing Carnegie Hall. Oh
Wow. Pretty cool. Yeah. Very cool.

1986
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:36,040
Have you done yet? No.
No, no. I'm not there

1987
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:40,920
yet. She is. All right. So theater,
that's it. And then of course, uh,

1988
02:07:40,990 --> 02:07:44,230
congratulations is the the podcast.
Yeah. I have a lot of fun doing that.

1989
02:07:44,231 --> 02:07:47,770
I didn't think I W I didn't know if you're
one of the few people that could pull

1990
02:07:47,771 --> 02:07:52,060
off the solo podcast too. Yeah. Uh, yeah.

1991
02:07:52,061 --> 02:07:55,540
I was like, I'm, I, when I started
I was like, oh, I don't want to do,

1992
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:58,090
I don't want to have to rely on getting
guests. Yeah, of course. That's,

1993
02:07:58,091 --> 02:08:00,460
you know what I'm saying? We had
no guests for two years. Oh really?

1994
02:08:00,461 --> 02:08:03,750
That's the reason. Oh, that's
cool. We just, we were like,
let's just do it our way.

1995
02:08:03,910 --> 02:08:07,230
And then, so why did you start getting
guests? Just because it's just the studio,

1996
02:08:07,231 --> 02:08:09,970
but you can do it by yourself. Right? You
still do. Sometimes you'll do it by, yeah.

1997
02:08:10,030 --> 02:08:14,530
Yeah. That's cool. Um, yeah. Um,
I don't know. And then I was like,

1998
02:08:14,531 --> 02:08:19,150
I'm just going to do it. And I
was like, uh, and I was like,

1999
02:08:19,151 --> 02:08:23,410
do people do it solo? And I was
like, I knew bird did it solo. Yeah.

2000
02:08:23,740 --> 02:08:28,570
And then I think like Theo started doing
it around the same time I did it and we

2001
02:08:28,571 --> 02:08:31,840
were like, Oh yeah, you do it by yourself
too. And, but uh, but then I was like,

2002
02:08:31,930 --> 02:08:35,500
cause I was like,
I don't think I can do an hour talking.

2003
02:08:35,830 --> 02:08:39,370
But then after like two episodes, I
was like, oh, I get it. What do you do?

2004
02:08:39,371 --> 02:08:43,170
Do you go in with like a Kinda like,
just like, uh, I mean, uh, sometimes not,

2005
02:08:43,770 --> 02:08:48,040
but sometimes, um, I'll have
like three or four things. Like,

2006
02:08:48,700 --> 02:08:52,090
you know, like this happened, I'm going to
talk about it. Yeah. Like if I, if I like,

2007
02:08:52,390 --> 02:08:55,990
yeah, exactly. Like the Taco bell thing
or if I saw it or like, you know, or like,

2008
02:08:55,991 --> 02:09:00,260
uh, the met gala we'll talk
about that happened basically
like a riff thing. Yeah.

2009
02:09:00,370 --> 02:09:03,940
I see what you do. You go in there and
I get bits out of it too, which is cool.

2010
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,640
That's cool. Yeah, we've gotten bits
out of it. Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

2011
02:09:07,750 --> 02:09:11,110
And your Instagram's very funny,
right? I liked the, I liked the,

2012
02:09:11,120 --> 02:09:15,400
those highlights too from the pod.
Oh, oh, cool. Funny. Oh thanks. Yeah.

2013
02:09:15,401 --> 02:09:18,760
So go see Chris live or of course

2015
02:09:22,331 --> 02:09:26,410
All their bro. This is
uh, a song. Let's see.

2016
02:09:26,411 --> 02:09:31,000
This is therapy breakthrough by Pete
Sake to take us out and I think it has a

2017
02:09:31,001 --> 02:09:35,170
bunch of, uh, trying on out there. Try
it out and Dr. Grouping her phone. Oh,

I love it. Great. All right. Thanks
guys. We'll see you next week.

2019
02:09:54,820 --> 02:09:57,510
This
is

2020
02:10:02,460 --> 02:10:03,293
twisted

2021
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:14,210
schizophrenia please. Lack of

2022
02:10:15,930 --> 02:10:18,580
empathy.
I think it's a red one.

2023
02:10:20,310 --> 02:10:24,570
Frantic and complete. Lack of

2024
02:10:26,280 --> 02:10:27,113
empathy

2025
02:10:40,200 --> 02:10:41,420
till death.

2026
02:10:44,620 --> 02:10:49,110
Do you think curious around Calico
is both. I swear to God. Oh, well

2027
02:10:53,760 --> 02:10:54,640
it makes me,

2028
02:11:03,020 --> 02:11:06,200
it makes me,
it makes me,

2029
02:11:13,470 --> 02:11:14,303
it makes me,

2030
02:11:23,800 --> 02:11:24,633
it makes me,

2031
02:11:33,420 --> 02:11:36,530
I,
I hate who I'm becoming socially.

2032
02:11:39,230 --> 02:11:40,410
I've never considered that

2033
02:11:44,520 --> 02:11:49,100
my out of my mind. Right. Crazy. You know,

2034
02:11:49,101 --> 02:11:53,720
