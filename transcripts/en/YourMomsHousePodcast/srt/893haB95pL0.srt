1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:05,300
Wow. Well, well go to your mom's house,

2
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,470
Christina. Visits. Increase Increase

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,170
Frank Sinatra. Yeah, I'm not entertained.

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,220
I don't think it's great.
It's also not thinking why you say that?

5
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:32,030
He's singing singing.
I can sing like him.

6
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,640
Hey
Bob.

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,700
Really man. It's like no, but what about

8
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,870
Cassie? Kindness thing is
that one. But most of it is a

9
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,620
come walking in those
ladies at the fuck man,

10
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,370
bring me a drink. I love slot. And
you're like, that's not really singing

11
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,620
man, man. Man,

12
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:11,330
man, man, man, man, man,

13
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,313
man,
man.

14
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:21,440
There's ladies at the great man. Yeah,

15
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,090
that's a, what is that? That's
[inaudible] Sinatra. Nice.

16
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,670
It's really good. Yeah.
By who is that? Hello?

17
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,980
Hello something I can't see. Um, yeah,

18
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:41,000
really good song. I like it.
It's not just terrible. Terrible.

19
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:46,090
Yeah. And it's a very, it's just,
it's too overexposed to like,

20
00:01:46,091 --> 00:01:51,091
I feel like you hear Sinatra and I'm very
corporate environments to buy that Sig

21
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:55,210
flow. Sorry, sig flow. You know
like when you go to a bar stocks,

22
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,530
it's like a corporate approved type of
music. Yeah. I think cause it's just,

23
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:00,920
it's been around for so long.

24
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:05,030
I also feel like it's fake
nostalgia. Right, right. The
guy that tried, he's like,

25
00:02:05,031 --> 00:02:09,530
I just, you know, I love
that throwback feel. Yeah.

26
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,251
Right.

27
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:14,720
But it's been so overused that it's not
even authentic anymore cause they'll

28
00:02:14,721 --> 00:02:18,830
play Frank Sinatra, you know, at the
Mcdonald's or whatever and you're like,

29
00:02:18,831 --> 00:02:19,910
well this isn't cool.

30
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,310
Yeah,
I know.

31
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,380
You know. You know what I'm saying? I'm
only talking about, yeah, talking about,

32
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,770
you usually hear Sinatra and like Yuppie
places like our crate and barrel or a

33
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:32,290
Serola Tabula or Williams and Sonoma.

34
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:35,710
Like when you're buying your
hundred dollar pots and pans.

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,730
Yeah. People like to force
that. Yeah. That feel, eh,

36
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,230
but it's good that bay to the bar.
I think maybe,

37
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:46,690
actually I just realized
that's my issue with it.

38
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,950
I feel like the person act like
they're into that whole thing.

39
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:53,970
Right?

40
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,970
Like when did you meet
somebody authentically playing
Sinatra at their house?

41
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,180
But that's what relax
too. You're like, oh,

42
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,460
it's all about the authenticity as
bullet points. Like a 70 year old guy.

43
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,990
Yeah. My Dad. Yeah. My Dad does
likes Frank Sinatra. It doesn't fit,

44
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,000
but it's a, it feels, it feels like
it's fake. I'm like love for it.

45
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,170
I think you're right. I
think you're, I think it's a
manufacturer. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,280
You're right. A fake nostalgia. And at
that point it's not neat. It's not cool.

47
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,760
It's not raw. Yeah, absolutely.
Right. Yeah. The fuck is she doing

48
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,660
Schnitzel looking for food?
She just went behind it.

49
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,970
She got up on the couch. She hasn't,
maybe she's lost a few pounds. She has,

50
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,310
cause I had been cutting her kibble but
she doing man she's looking for is for

51
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,180
things to get into.

52
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,000
I cut her kibble intake so she
still eats the table scraps to fall,

53
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,171
but it's actually,

54
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:50,680
it's only been like a week of doing
that and she's already dropped some lbs.

55
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:55,180
It looks like. Oh for my uh, audio
people, I get a lot of people that,

56
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,690
you know,
ask questions and make suggestions about,

57
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,650
so I have an update on this computer show
with tutors or he would open the show.

58
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,850
I was wondering if we should watch the
mic guy because this discussion you're

59
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:09,470
about to get into sounds about
as interesting. I don't know.

60
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,750
I don't have him cute up, but I'm
saying it sounds like a real boring.

61
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,090
Are you going to get real technical on it?
Well,

62
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:19,570
it's a little technical but I think
we have a lot of people that have have

63
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:24,190
written in about it. Okay. So, so we
do the show with two two computers,

64
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,520
right. This basically becomes
the, the video computer,

65
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:30,700
the one I'm sitting in front of
and it's like a backup audio thing,

66
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,990
but the majority of the audio stuff
plays from the second computer. Right.

67
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,250
So that one for the second
time got butt fucked,

68
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,740
stopped working.
I took it in.

69
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,380
They will have already replaced a
logic board on it and I go, what?

70
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,090
She just did a code on it.

71
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:51,000
She reset the p Ram and then the p ramp
that I prayed to bring it back here,

72
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,250
plug it in.
Not the same issue but not playing.

73
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,550
So now I think it's actually the
Jack that I plugged in there.

74
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,080
So I'm going to get into cables plugging
and unplugging the cable and plug cause

75
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:08,160
you're messing with it. I then
somebody else. Yeah. You kind of,

76
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:12,220
you kind of solved it. I think
that there's also a, um, uh,

77
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,910
there's a software that somebody
told me to download to, to do,

78
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:18,010
to streamline this more.
So I'm going to try that too.

79
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,430
But we still don't have it today
because today I couldn't hook it up.

80
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,060
It's still an issue with it. Kind of.
It just fucking, it's so annoying.

81
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,633
It is annoying.

82
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,340
It sucks cause we do our show off of
that and all our drops are on there so I

83
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:32,380
had to transfer some. It's
like, but, and then I have that,

84
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,490
that version of the show
opened. That doesn't sound
the same for whatever reason.

85
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,000
It doesn't sound the same on this
computer. I don't understand that at all.

86
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,220
It doesn't work. Sucks. Yeah. So weird.

87
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:48,040
So we're just going to have to power
through, glass it through glass through.

88
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,110
Um, all right. Should we open the show?

89
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,920
I properly [inaudible] on my leather
mask or, yeah, it was the real math.

90
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:58,280
Let's fucking do this shit, man.
A virgin out from his chest,

91
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,820
from the covering with the
tension of pulling on the tail.

92
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,780
Those muscles are actually being
squeezed out into pushing out the penis.

93
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,233
Okay,

94
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,140
well welcome
to your mom's house.

95
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,130
And Christina

96
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,420
came here.
I know

97
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:52,130
DOR did. And it's the, that's all funky
sounding. I don't, I have no idea. Um,

98
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,120
it's a real low fi version.
I don't get it, man.

99
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,340
Anyways.
Um,

100
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,540
but scoop Bedo the de la God,

101
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,420
that's the way it goes sometimes abroad.

102
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,370
Well Not Take Yo rob far bup, bup, bup.

103
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,810
So you hang with the fellows
and you have a drink.

104
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,590
Oh six loaded up, bup, bup, bup, bup.

105
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,120
I'm the most popular
singer of the 20th century.

106
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:31,490
Right. And it also hearkens back
to a time like, isn't that the 50s?

107
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,150
Isn't that a time of like total sexism,

108
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:38,810
racism when the white man
while still does dominate,

109
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:42,800
but like a time when Whitey really fucking
let you know that he was in charge.

110
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,100
I had a real special black with them.
You know they had one, right? Yeah,

111
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,020
they're allowed one. There
you are. Cool. And he's right.

112
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,200
He was black and he was Jew met
both quotas and then they're like,

113
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:57,240
the rest of us are white.
We're not racist. Fucking
Sam is here the whole time.

114
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,420
Right? Yeah. Yeah, totally. And I,

115
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:03,320
but ironically that time in Vegas
is where those guys are performing.

116
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:07,900
That's back when Vegas was
about, it was Sodom and Gomorrah.
Yeah. It was, you know,

117
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:12,170
hookers and drugs and really
changed. Oozing. Yeah.

118
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,570
It's good and so crazy. And
like Nevada now has, uh,

119
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,350
I think they're, I think they passed
recreational marijuana. Not like that.

120
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:24,680
You couldn't do find it before,
but imagine to add that into the mix.

121
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:29,120
Like right now, weed is legal. You can
walk on the streets with open beverages.

122
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,550
Uh,
the Raiders are probably gonna be

123
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,460
I being serious. Yeah. That's chaos. You
should not have the writers there course,

124
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:40,870
but it's also on Nepal. It's perfect. It
is no better town to have the Raiders.

125
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,750
That is where they should be. Yeah. Just

126
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,890
amazing. It's just going to be people
shooting guns in the air, like, yeah,

127
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,310
we totally nuts by the way.

128
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,130
Thanks everybody that came out.
Um, Huntington, Long Island,

129
00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:00,580
Montclair, New Jersey, and Atlantic
city, another shitty isn't it?

130
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:04,820
Lacks Shitty, far Atlantic,
shitty, really fun shows. Uh,

131
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,510
my parents came to Atlantic shitty show.

132
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,001
I know,

133
00:09:07,001 --> 00:09:11,830
cause your dad called this morning and
he never asks to speak to me directly,

134
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:14,710
but you handed me the phone
and I got really excited.

135
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,670
He was really demanding it and I got
super pumped because I was like, oh,

136
00:09:18,671 --> 00:09:23,530
we're gonna do some brown talk. I mean
the dog and I, yeah. And what he does,

137
00:09:23,531 --> 00:09:24,700
and he does this every time,

138
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,820
is he just talks about how proud he
is of you and how much he loves you.

139
00:09:27,821 --> 00:09:31,300
He's like, you know,
or Zena Brown, a Tommy,

140
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,460
he's just such a great kid.

141
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:35,763
Great.

142
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,260
And he just talks about
how proud he is of you,

143
00:09:42,261 --> 00:09:45,860
of how well you did at the show and
your performance and your routine.

144
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,960
And then notice lately,

145
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,830
nothing like start to cringe more
than I would. He goes, hey, you know,

146
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,510
I watched the crowd.
Okay, I watched them. And,

147
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,470
uh, you, uh, you, you know,

148
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:06,471
you talk about things that they
also can relate to now I'm like,

149
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,053
yeah,

150
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,530
it's called the top. That's what
we all do. I think. Yeah. There,

151
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,640
because if you don't, people don't laugh.
Right. You got to hit a common ground,

152
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:17,040
but you, you have, uh,

153
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,990
I don't know really just,
it's really neat. No, try it.

154
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:26,860
Can I tell you what he said to me? That
was the best two gene. He goes, uh, uh,

155
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,760
uh, uh, audience was really excited.

156
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,980
See him like really excited and
this girl next to me was just dying,

157
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,470
just dying everything Tony,
he was saying.

158
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:42,030
And then I did really laughing and I was
so tempted to tell her that to my son

159
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,640
and at the end of the show I leaned over
and I said, that's my son. Yeah. And uh,

160
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,710
she really flipped out.
Yeah.

161
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,510
I told him, he was telling
me that. He was like, yeah,

162
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,930
I said to a somebody that's my son,
and then the guy goes,

163
00:10:58,931 --> 00:11:01,910
top dog. And I go, yeah.

164
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,120
He goes, I couldn't help myself, Tony.
And my mom was like, don't please.

165
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,620
When she told me, she was like, I said,
please don't please, please, please.

166
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,650
Now your mom, you said, um,
it has been having a better,

167
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,770
excuse me time at your shows
lately because you've been,

168
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,471
uh,

169
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:24,300
encouraging actually demanding
that she drink before the show.

170
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,790
Right. So that has been a
huge, huge help. I tell my dad,

171
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:35,090
give her too, because she really
can't handle her alcohol. Yes.

172
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,250
The best. Give her too. Um, and,

173
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,010
and make sure that, you know, she's good
and sauced it works so well. First of all,

174
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,060
she gets lightheaded and loose.
Yeah.

175
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,550
She didn't even remember what
the show about it the best when

176
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,980
she can't criticize or critique or not
what she has. I'm not worried about

177
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,370
that.

178
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:59,280
I just don't want her to like really
internalize anything really. Yeah.

179
00:11:59,281 --> 00:12:03,370
I mean like she just, at this point she
feels like, so because she'll, if she,

180
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,940
if she's sober, she'd be like,
that thing was kind of, you know,

181
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,070
that wasn't very nice to say that. Yeah.
At this point my dad was like, you know,

182
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:14,470
that was true and that my mom goes,
what?

183
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,760
It's like that whole story he told about
me. What story? I didn't even Amnesia.

184
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,020
None of it. None of it. None. I love
it. Lou went over. So I was like,

185
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,240
this is the only way she's
allowed to come to them.

186
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:30,190
Yeah. Well we instituted this policy
when she came to visit last time. Yeah.

187
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:30,820
Uh,

188
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,540
she came in and we immediately gave her
a drink and it ended up being the best

189
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:38,230
time we ever had with your folks. Cause
every time she'd come over I'd be like,

190
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:40,660
Charlie, you want, you want your peanut
Greens? You want your peanut agrees? No,

191
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,790
no I cannot. And then I would just
pour a, for her memory you would like,

192
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,720
tell me like, just pour for
end. Pour her a big one. Yeah.

193
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,990
I shall never take a second for, yeah.
So I was giving her like, you know,

194
00:12:49,991 --> 00:12:53,890
tall boys of Pinot grigio
and it was fantastic for us.

195
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:57,340
Like I remember they were down
on the floor with Ellis laughing.

196
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,120
It was great fighting for his affection.
It was the best time. Alcohol is the,

197
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,010
Oh, this is, this is the other
thing I wanted to tell you.

198
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,890
The last time she went to the,
the, uh, the live show. Yeah.

199
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,180
She drank and she goes, you know
what I have to tell you, did I,

200
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,630
I love the show.
Is that no more.

201
00:13:14,631 --> 00:13:19,370
You don't do the f anymore and
you don't say you're masturbating.

202
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,270
And my dad looked at me like,
like, what are you talking about?

203
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,660
He talked about that for like 15,
right? What show are you at it?

204
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,580
But then we realized it was the,

205
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,980
the sauce, the, the, yeah, the
sauce. The sauce, you know,

206
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:36,790
alcohol and drugs are great
for some people's personality.

207
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,670
Like my father is off the booze now.
Yeah. And he's a miserable content.

208
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,800
Right. And I don't like him
over because he's not fun.

209
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,920
And my dad's so much better
than when he's drinking. Yeah.

210
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,170
So people are like that. I have friends
too that are, I mean, obviously, you know,

211
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,790
everyone knows this.
Some people,

212
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:58,110
it's fucking toxic to the point
where you see that second drink,

213
00:13:58,111 --> 00:14:02,280
go down someone's hat and you're like,
oh yeah, I had friends like that.

214
00:14:02,281 --> 00:14:06,210
Even at high school. Yeah. And I recognize
like once this dude has three beers,

215
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,920
he headbutts people.
Right. Um, and then when,

216
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,270
then there's people who just are funneled
like Burt's a great example. Okay.

217
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,420
Exemplary drinker. Yeah.
Bert Burnt Chrysler. Yeah.

218
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,070
The unfortunate problem is that he's
great when he's drunk. Yeah. Yeah.

219
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,440
And I had been drunk just drinking.
You don't even know that he's drunk now.

220
00:14:25,441 --> 00:14:30,270
You don't know. Like, he's so fun. He's a
fun, fun guy. And my dad, the same thing,

221
00:14:30,271 --> 00:14:34,560
like a party drunk. Like he's
actually kind of a fun dude. Yeah.

222
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,720
I'm sure he's had a few in him.
He used to crank up the ABA. Yeah.

223
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:42,030
In the house and dance and like Andrix
Oh Henrik, I was on the darker days.

224
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,220
That's when he was running lights off.
Yeah.

225
00:14:44,221 --> 00:14:47,670
I'd come home from like high
school if, I don't know, like 15.

226
00:14:47,671 --> 00:14:50,160
I come home at night from like
hanging out with my friends and uh,

227
00:14:50,161 --> 00:14:55,161
he'd be sitting in the listening to
Hendrix listening to it so loud that I,

228
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,970
I was like, oh my God, did somebody
break in and turn off our stereo?

229
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,570
Like I would walk in and it'd be like
blaring and he would also have the

230
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:06,830
television on muted,
which makes me crazy personally.

231
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:10,160
Like if something's on an,
I can't understand what's
happening, I can't do it.

232
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,330
And he would just mute the TV and then
listen to Hendrix and just sit in the

233
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:19,130
fucking dark, like, get weird. I was
like, cool. This is normal. Right.

234
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,510
Functional value. That's just how I used
to get down. Yeah. That was his unwinding,

235
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,150
right? Yeah. That was a
weekend. That wasn't a weekday.

236
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,630
That was like a Friday night kind of
wind down. That's the end of the night.

237
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,970
Definitely.
That was like midnight.

238
00:15:31,971 --> 00:15:36,620
I'm rolling in and I remember
he was into that Marley mix to,

239
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,460
you know, I'm sorry. Yeah. There was some,

240
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:44,490
a song that he played. Yeah.
That was like, oh, this is a,

241
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,040
you know, he likes that stuff. Yeah.

242
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:52,270
You know what really made me laugh that
he used to do with my ex step mom is a,

243
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:57,280
she fucking hated German Christmas music
and my dad would play this one CD that

244
00:15:58,221 --> 00:16:01,760
we had and there was one song,
Hi Jay,

245
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:06,560
boom by g and she would fucking,
she would never get mad,

246
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,190
but when hide you boom. Baiji came on
just to irritate it. Oh, of course.

247
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,460
That was the whole fun is that my dad
would look at me because he had had a few

248
00:16:13,461 --> 00:16:17,930
in him and he was like, you ready for
the Christmas music? And I was like, yes,

249
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:21,260
because I knew that she was going to
get fucking hate it so much. She just,

250
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:22,094
she would say that.

251
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,740
Yeah.
Hi.

252
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,460
Did you move by g? I hate
these songs still good. Again,

253
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:34,050
like folks she hated for like you
with red, red wine. I hate red,

254
00:16:34,051 --> 00:16:38,280
red wine. But you don't play it to
agitate me like on Christmas. No,

255
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:43,230
but I mean it's not a bad idea.
I'm not going to not start doing that.

256
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,120
That's terrible with the boy.
That's terrible. Put whatever.

257
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,800
I'll get mad. Yeah, that's
the fun part is pissing Mama.

258
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,340
What's your read song? I'm trying to
think. You're a, it makes you see, fuck,

259
00:16:57,341 --> 00:17:01,380
I definitely have some. It's just I can't
really access and what it is right now.

260
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,260
You know you don't, but you don't
get as angry on arbitrary shit.

261
00:17:04,261 --> 00:17:08,640
Like I do know you get
angry at people like pro,

262
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:13,230
like in competence makes you angry.
I get mad at like irrational,

263
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,080
like songs make me angry. Yeah. I'd say
I'm healthy. What that's about. Yeah,

264
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,880
I'd say I'd say the diagnosis probably.
Yeah.

265
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,140
Well definitely one of us had a
dad that drank and the dark. Yeah,

266
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:30,840
I'd say so. Psychologists definitely.

267
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,870
You're definitely the mental
health champ of the both of us.

268
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,430
I work a lot harder to see.

269
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,150
I heard that one before.
Yeah.

270
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:49,040
Yeah. My Dad. Yeah. Ah, oh, he's,

271
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,000
they're so sweet.
They're going

272
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,170
to come back and visit soon.

273
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:55,100
I can't wait till I had my dad and my
mom and I'm married. My mom asked him,

274
00:17:55,101 --> 00:17:58,890
will you ever date your mom married her?
That's so true.

275
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,420
That's so true. Yeah. You. Oh, you married
her this weekend and I did Atlantic city.

276
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,270
I did him and my mom the other day.
What was the ceremony like? Oh,

277
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:09,200
it was real nice. And Atlantic
City, you know, we had it.

278
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:14,130
We did it right there at the Borgata.
Oh, that's cool. Very cool. Yeah,

279
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:17,490
it was fun. It was actually really fun.
You had a good time hanging with her? Uh,

280
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:21,270
hung out. Uh, she's, she's the slot
champs. Uh, she's in the slots,

281
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,260
loose loose slots,
but um,

282
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,550
she's not really good at it so that's
kind of real funny. That's hilarious.

283
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,590
Then the best thing is she has,
she's somebody who really sucks at it,

284
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,910
cause a perennial loser but
has all the advice for you.

285
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,670
So I always like the whole
time I'm with her, she's like,

286
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,050
this machine doesn't pay these
machine base. So you go like,

287
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,250
okay, you said to her machine
and then you're bedding too much.

288
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:51,420
I'm like [inaudible] like everything she
says, I just, I keep telling her, I go,

289
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,520
whatever your instincts tell you, do
the opposite. You're the fucking cooler.

290
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,020
Like you just kill a room. Well, I mean,

291
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:05,010
is there such a thing as a strategy for
slots? Well, I don't know if they're,

292
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:07,740
I mean probably not,
but there is there.

293
00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:10,590
I do know this just from
somebody I know who has,

294
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,240
I'm sure he's lost a lot of money,

295
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:15,360
but I know there's a lot that want
a lot of money as well. I mean,

296
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:20,010
I believe you go,
you get into your range and you Max bet.

297
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,970
There's no point in men the bets
on those things because all the,

298
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,330
if you do hit something then
what's the point is if you bet,

299
00:19:27,331 --> 00:19:31,080
but more so get like, get on a fucking
penny machine Max. So she's like,

300
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:35,250
don't bet so much. Which was
the Max bet on a penny? Well,

301
00:19:35,251 --> 00:19:40,160
I mean some of them it might be like a
dollar a spin. And if you go to like the,

302
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,010
you know,

303
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:45,210
or you can do $3 or five or you can go
to the high limit slots and that $50 a

304
00:19:45,211 --> 00:19:48,390
spin. But I just don't see the
point. I'm like, you never win.

305
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:53,210
And you're betting strategy never works.
So try the one. I'm telling you. No,

306
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:58,140
no. Yeah. Shin listened to you. Of course
not. But I still had fun watching her.

307
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,570
And then if it would, if she would
have hit something and we'd go like,

308
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:03,690
do you need nicotine meaning and it
would, uh, it would go like, you know,

309
00:20:03,691 --> 00:20:06,930
pay out like $1 50 cents there. Look
at you. You're fucking killing it.

310
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,660
And do you get paid in pennies?
Does it come out in pennies? No,

311
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:13,980
just it just adds up and
you know, it doesn't pay. It
doesn't, pennies don't drop.

312
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,470
It just adds to your
bank. So it'd be like, oh,

313
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:21,230
it would hit and it'd be like
70 cents. Look at you. Oh Wow.

314
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,220
I can see their logic. I mean, if
you're not in it for the money,

315
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,410
just the excitement of the win.
Yeah, that is it. She gets a rush,

316
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,780
but she's always complaining
that she never gets like,

317
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:34,820
it never wins any real money and like,
cause you're not betting real money. Yeah.

318
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,690
You can get a pony up. Yeah. She won't
do it. She's like, no, it's too much.

319
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,800
Maybe it's good that she's not into
aggressive gambling. She fucking,

320
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,410
she's so bad.
So bad.

321
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,120
But your mom's good at bridge.
Yeah.

322
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:57,450
Well there's no real like you
are lucking out on a machine.

323
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,710
There's no strategies pressing a button.
Yeah.

324
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,210
But I just think that like whenever
she thinks it's time, I go,

325
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:06,940
whenever your body tells you,
get up from this machine move

326
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:12,220
and whenever your body says go to that
machine, walk away. In other words,

327
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:14,690
you stop trusting yourself.
You're bad at this.

328
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:19,030
It's like when my mother used to give
me advice. Yeah. I'd be like, oh, okay,

329
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:21,760
I'll just do the opposite of what you
said because I know you're fucking crazy.

330
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,380
Do the opposite of what you
think is literally would.

331
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,960
And then my life was super happy. She
told me not to marry you. She was like,

332
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:32,830
you should get back together with your
lawyer ex boyfriend. I was like, oh,

333
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:35,890
that means I got to marry Tom.
Tom Is definitely in the winter

334
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,250
and see worked out. Yeah. She
didn't like you at all. She didn't,

335
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,910
didn't know you though.
She's crazy. Shared voices
telling her that you were, um,

336
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,480
you didn't like her really swear
to God. Yeah, she heard voices.

337
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,620
But sometimes you got to
trust those voices. She did.

338
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:58,450
Sometimes you do.
Where's the,

339
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,080
I'm trying to find the whale decks.
No wheel. Dick's is right here.

340
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:05,380
I was trying to find something else. Um,
but okay, we can get in a wheelchair.

341
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:10,040
I love this clip. I was
just so taken with this. Oh,

342
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,140
I remember now. Okay. What
is it Jane? No, I remember,

343
00:22:12,141 --> 00:22:15,430
I remember what I was looking
for. Um, this lady here,

344
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:26,030
this is massive whale.
Yeah. Is beached. Yeah.

345
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:30,950
It's so enormous. It's
so cool. So huge. Um,

346
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:35,630
and she is a, an expert. And then there's
like, there's a, there's a, what is that?

347
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,910
A forklift?
I mean a

348
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,550
fucking thing is so massive
that, you know, there's a,

349
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:46,340
there's a team of people on the
beach and she's the scientist.

350
00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:50,440
Obviously she's the one that, that knows
about the specimen. And then, you know,

351
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:57,220
covering the tension
of pulling on the tail.

352
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,150
Those muscles are actually being
squeezed out into pushing out the penis.

353
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:02,403
It's so big

354
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,180
city. Can you hold for a
second so I can show the penis?

355
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,680
Oh till I tell you,
cause we just looking at something,

356
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:15,690
he doesn't say what Stop Day is massive.

357
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,710
It's bananas

358
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:26,090
Sheath pulling the Penis.
Alright,

359
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,310
I didn't cut it off guys.
Come on.

360
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,400
Do you know what I love about her is
that everybody's like, I'm a nerd.

361
00:23:37,401 --> 00:23:42,340
I'm an I play video games. I'm a nerd.
Like no, no, no. That's a real nerd. Yeah.

362
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,360
She's a real nerd. It's awesome.
Great. Yeah, but that's a fucking nerd.

363
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:51,110
Not Farell or whoever. Cruel
wrapper. Right, right, right.

364
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,120
The black guy with glasses
isn't a fucking nerd.

365
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:57,980
That's a nerd and a sweater.
Well, I'm such a nerd.

366
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,880
I know. I am a girl who plays video games
like, oh, okay. I've read two books.

367
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:06,470
I'm a nerd, right? No, this lady knows
everything about whales. Everything.

368
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,800
Her life is Wilcox. Yeah. I
don't know about just the Cox.

369
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,890
She just loves licking them.
Holding them. Suck on them. No.

370
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:17,480
Putting the warn her phrase, the semen
on her friend. Hard drive round Pam.

371
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,840
She loves me. This is a whale's penis.
No, my life. This is only part of it.

372
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:27,060
Notice by the way, there's no bone in
his penis. It's completely flexible.

373
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,410
Whoa,
whoa.

374
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,460
Give you an idea of the size of this cock.
It's sitting on her lap.

375
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,080
She's bent down.
Yeah.

376
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:40,030
And like she's holding basically,
I don't know, not even,

377
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:45,130
not even half of it with one hand
and then flapping open handed the,

378
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:49,810
the, uh, the end of it,
flapping it around. It looks
like a, it's like a fire hose,

379
00:24:49,811 --> 00:24:53,740
but I mean, like they've already in
gorge. It's actually bigger than that.

380
00:24:53,741 --> 00:24:57,970
You know, it actually looks like
a safety cone painted black. Um,

381
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,230
or like a black person's leg.

382
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,213
Yeah.

383
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,730
There's like a leg.

384
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,950
No. Yeah. No.

385
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,870
I think the safety cone was a better,
like, imagine a six follow a safety count,

386
00:25:11,871 --> 00:25:15,910
but a black one, right? Yeah.
Yeah. Not a bad person is like,

387
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,393
okay.

388
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,520
It's actually probably the most
amazing penis in the animal world.

389
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:26,220
I love her so much. Yeah.
Now here's why. Probably,

390
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,340
and she makes a really good point of
why it's the most amazing penis. Yeah.

391
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,660
It's because they can't stop
the mount. Oh, right. Yeah.

392
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:38,710
Take us this penis is prehensile how when
you're a whale you can't grab another

393
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:44,090
well with your flippers and hug it and
make love to it and you don't really have

394
00:25:44,091 --> 00:25:46,790
very good hits so you can't
really do that motion.

395
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:50,660
So you got to reach the female anyway
you can. And this is what they use.

396
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,150
A penis is completely flexible.

397
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,840
Their kid penetrate from
almost any position.

398
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:02,200
Wow. So crazy. It is an amazing, she's
right. They can't hug. They can't thrust.

399
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:07,150
Like how did dolphins fuck, we should
try it. We should try this approach.

400
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,100
What's that approach?
Bed.

401
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:14,410
Just like no mounting,
no thrusting.

402
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,520
And when do we do, I don't know.
We just have to, it's just science.

403
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:23,380
So what else? Don't have a
favorite position. You know,

404
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:25,750
like there's no such thing
as missionary position.

405
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:28,480
All the whales and one of the few
animals that do make belly to belly like

406
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:29,323
primates,

407
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:35,260
it's because of this ultra humongous
penis that they could actually even have

408
00:26:36,101 --> 00:26:37,220
babies.
I love

409
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,280
her so much, man. The thing is don't
you love checks like this? Yeah,

410
00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:42,200
she's cool man.
He's like so into it.

411
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:46,110
She's like the only person that knows
this much about this whale's penis. Yeah.

412
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,510
Super stoked about it out here.
So that's really the land joy.

413
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,560
I know you love the
penis or we have to stop.

414
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,890
We haven't got to get this whale off the
beach. Or you finished it and know then.

415
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,360
Yes. Okay. All right. This
theme dot. You've got so hot and

416
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,150
unbelievable.

417
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,270
Yeah, that's cute. Right?
That's their little comedy.

418
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:14,080
He had to go in and you know it's coming.

419
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,610
Yeah.

420
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,193
Okay.

421
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,440
That is massive.
It is massive.

422
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,780
What else? Basle this basil. I like the
a worker's laughing. That's my favorite.

423
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:31,130
They're like no change from fifth
grade on. We don't change course.

424
00:27:31,131 --> 00:27:33,920
You shouldn't go that big Ole Dick.

425
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:40,960
Yeah, it's true. Yeah. It's
something you laughing now.

426
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,470
A Dick,
of course.

427
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,050
Especially because she's super
stoked about seeing a whale deck.

428
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,080
If my dad was on that beach right,
then hundred percent wouldn't be. Yeah.

429
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,270
I still love it.
Seven or eight years old,

430
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,940
pollute free lap dance. Love those
jokes. Oh, I got a little projects

431
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,350
crazy. Um, oh, you mentioned.
So I figured I would.

432
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,400
Uh,
you know,

433
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:10,760
I have come all over.
My face might have come all of ours,

434
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,720
all over Maine.

435
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,870
We played, uh, this lady last week.

436
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,480
Same Guy will never even touch
his own calm or tastes all come.

437
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,680
I've seen this happen so many times with
guys. You know what I'm talking about?

438
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:27,080
Yeah.
You posted,

439
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,820
you posted I are on your,
no,

440
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:34,340
it was the Instagram teaser
that I'm saying the weekly
teaser. Here's the thing.

441
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,790
I think we should go
on strike against calm.

442
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:42,860
Accum strike somebody a note.
I noticed that you noticed it,

443
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,390
right? Somebody who was like, Hey, is
that and actually tagged this woman?

444
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:51,830
Do you know her name? Oh, well
I can find it. Hold on. So God,

445
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:55,940
it's always weird when you play a video
like this and then you talk a lot of

446
00:28:55,941 --> 00:28:59,000
shit. Yeah. And you're a total asshole.
And I mean, and then it's like, oh,

447
00:28:59,001 --> 00:29:03,500
it's a real person. Yeah. I hate
that. I fucking hate that. Uh,

448
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,120
I've always feel horrible and
I'm like, God, I know he's,

449
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:10,070
we shouldn't have been such, but I didn't
realize something. Uh, what is her name?

450
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,950
Oh, here she is. Uh, she's on Instagram.

451
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:17,480
Shahrzad Shahrzad should we give her
lab? I don't want to. Yeah, it's okay.

452
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:22,160
Okay. Uh, Shahrzad and Morgan. Yeah.

453
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:27,020
And she's written a book, which is
why we wanted to kind of, right.

454
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:31,820
Yeah. I mean, look, she's um, here
Shahrzad what kind of name is that?

455
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:37,010
No. Shahrzad Morgan. Um, but it says,

456
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:42,160
oh, she said in that comment
that she's an escort,

457
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,020
which explains everything. Yeah.
Because we were like, wait,

458
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:51,040
why is this woman had this problem in
life that these guys are just coming all

459
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:54,400
over her and asking her to taste
it and well, that makes sense.

460
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:58,930
If she's an escort then
she's a professional come
dealer. You know what I mean?

461
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,810
I see it in there. It
doesn't say I have no, I,

462
00:30:01,811 --> 00:30:04,540
here's what I have that she
wrote a book called pleasure,

463
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:09,520
a memoir and you can get
it@mypleasurebook.com. So
just to give her a shout out,

464
00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:13,330
cause since we shit on her so
hard last week. Yeah. Uh, sorry.

465
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,190
Shahrzad we didn't know you were an
escort. If I knew that then it would,

466
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:21,460
it changed the game and she has a new
book coming out called what I did for sex

467
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:25,090
and what it can do for you. Oh,
that's cool. So now we totally,

468
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:28,780
we thought she was like a new
divorce, say maybe and yeah, she was,

469
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,210
which might be true also as yeah.
Who knows?

470
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,540
But that totally changes the
whole nature of the beast here.

471
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,030
Yeah. Um, and she did, she,

472
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:42,660
she was nice enough that after we
fucking absolutely shit all over this,

473
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,430
um, where's, she said, well thanks
for the compliment on my teeth. Yeah.

474
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,010
She does have a really nice to you.
I know.

475
00:30:50,011 --> 00:30:53,390
And we compliment and shoot and of all
the things she said, she pointed that out.

476
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,260
Nice Lady. Yeah, she's
nice. She says here,

477
00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:00,100
mother has a bachelor of
science in Computer Science,

478
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:04,240
Mba and she does a TM high now.
Just like me,

479
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,260
just like Asian genes, just like Asian
genes. Agent jeans. Oh our, yeah.

480
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,380
Our agent does TM. Yeah. I'm
the only one that's not on you.

481
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,720
You're not onboard board
the, the cold train. No,

482
00:31:16,721 --> 00:31:19,990
but I'm going to do it because you guys
got me both thinking about it so much,

483
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,550
girl. You got me thinking about it.
Thinking about how much I love you.

484
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,020
I love you.

485
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,780
Yeah, it's good. You should try it.
Um, just check it out if you like it.

486
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,660
If we're not, then you don't
have to wipe. Come on your face.

487
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:39,710
I meditating right now
in your mouth to come.

488
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,610
Remember I didn't the white tiger say
that did she would like to draw in the

489
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:48,900
essence? Yeah. She would put the cum
on her face and meditate and how veal.

490
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:55,830
I want to talk about the white
tigress practice holding the penis.

491
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,200
And she was hosed

492
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:03,460
by, uh, some fucking guy
like the, the guy 20. Yeah.

493
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,390
This activation God is activation.
Some guy like that was like,

494
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:08,250
you don't want to be a white
tigers. And she was like, okay.

495
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:12,430
Okay. If she get a special
title, like White Tiger. Yeah,

496
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:16,060
you get a white tiger is tight. Oh,
do I get an award? It's diploma.

497
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,380
So here's the thing, I think we
should go on strike against calm.

498
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:26,110
Okay. Well, if she's an escort then yeah.

499
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:31,100
Yeah. Okay. Another thing,
you should always wrap that
thing up. Yeah, yeah. Yes.

500
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:35,840
Right. Yeah. Gosh, that's a whole
other, that's a whole other thing, man.

501
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:40,010
Yeah, it's a lot. Yeah,
totally. Totally. Now, when

502
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:44,990
you use escorts, do you use
a condom? Uh, always. Always.

503
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:49,910
You can't play that game,
otherwise get burned by gonorrhea.

504
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:54,260
Used to say that all the time. Don't
we first started dating and I was like,

505
00:32:54,261 --> 00:32:56,480
do you have any diseases I should
know about? And you're like, well,

506
00:32:56,481 --> 00:33:01,280
I got burned by Garrett gonorrhea
one time. Twice. You got burnt twice.

507
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,520
Yeah, I did. I got burned
by gonorrhea twice.

508
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,420
That's true. But that's bacterial, so
that's fine. You can treat that. Yeah.

509
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,570
But you still don't want
it. What's it feel like? Um,

510
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,550
I dunno. It just, it doesn't feel
good. It feels better than it used.

511
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:24,050
Good. Yeah. Does It hurt when you pee?

512
00:33:24,051 --> 00:33:28,730
Is that gonorrhea? Um, yeah. Yeah. It
Hurts when you pee. It doesn't look good.

513
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:33,580
It look like, um, it looks like you
got an infection on your deferral.

514
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,790
Yeah. What sluts gave you that? Oh,

515
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,960
just fucking dirty road
beef, man. Geez, Tom. Yeah.

516
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,060
I had a dream last night that you,
uh,

517
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,430
had sex was one of my close friends,
one of your real close friends that,

518
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,100
because then I wake up and
I'm mad at you all day.

519
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,940
Even though rationally I know
I shouldn't be unconsciously.

520
00:33:55,941 --> 00:34:00,830
Every time I look at you, I feel just
a like a shiver of hate. And then I go,

521
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:04,380
oh wait. He didn't really do
anything. But I do hate you a little,

522
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:07,130
just a little bit today,
by the way. It's real cool.

523
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:12,190
And it's happened throughout
the course of our relationship.

524
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,100
We're, I would say today's
definitely one of the better days.

525
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:20,930
There's days where you carried anger
throughout the day from your dreams.

526
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:25,490
There couldn't be a more irrational
reason to be upset and you've been like,

527
00:34:25,491 --> 00:34:26,450
it's fucked up. Oh, you've,

528
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:31,160
you've cited your dream as the reason
you're in a bad mood before. Well,

529
00:34:31,161 --> 00:34:32,420
it's logical.
I mean,

530
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:36,950
dreams put you in a bad mood and then
I just have to remind myself constantly

531
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:40,940
that you didn't do the thing
you did. Yeah, yeah. Well,

532
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,270
yeah, I'll be liked it.
I did sex in your mind,

533
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,990
whatever. No one is hooking up with any
of your friends. You always say that.

534
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:58,430
Why would you say that it's true. No
one's so going to let any of your friends.

535
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:03,200
That's true. Why are you
saying that? Because you're
fucking your friends or dog.

536
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:07,880
The bounty hunter and they're not dogs.
They're not.

537
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,210
You got to fucking say that all the time.
It's like a rescue clinic.

538
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:17,570
That's so silly breed. Are you into
Christina's got him as a friend for sure.

539
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,640
You're so crazy.
If I just,

540
00:35:19,641 --> 00:35:24,300
because I don't hang out with
superficial Kardashians girl.

541
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,940
Everybody wants,

542
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,500
I don't hang out with girls that spend
all their money on a liposuction.

543
00:35:30,501 --> 00:35:33,680
And how about just a good friend that
looks kind of like you would that?

544
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:38,220
That's a problem on my friends.
Any Blondie's? Yeah, sure.

545
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,640
I don't know. I'm not, you know
what I like? That's so funny.

546
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:44,580
I like grumpy brunettes. Throw all
my friends and you know what I like,

547
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:47,280
so stop fucking around. Oh, that's
right. You're like Blondie's.

548
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,920
Maybe there's a reason I'm not friends
with any blinds because you'll start

549
00:35:49,921 --> 00:35:54,810
sexting. Yeah, maybe. Or those
of your p s speaking of texts,

550
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,790
I got a very interesting one.
Holy Shit. It's not Salamay.

551
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:04,170
So to recap, don't want to change
her phone number at this point.

552
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,310
What year and a half ago.

553
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:11,300
And you started at first
getting job offers for a nurse.

554
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:17,310
She's got a lot of nursing
opportunities in Florida. Boca Raton,

555
00:36:17,311 --> 00:36:19,710
I get the calls weekly,
we're hiring and Clearwater,

556
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:24,360
and then she never gets to the calls.
Then out of nowhere it was like,

557
00:36:24,361 --> 00:36:27,000
where are you Aiden?
Where are you?

558
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:32,490
Where are you people or let people
love you still feel like that.

559
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:36,690
And then it was like you weren't at
your AAA today. And then we're like, oh.

560
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:41,940
And then there was the calls when eight
is checked himself out of the Rehab

561
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:45,810
Clinic and I got calls from his
shrinks and it was like eight us.

562
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,170
You can't just check yourself
out of treatment. I really
need to speak with you.

563
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:51,660
This is doctor Blah Blah Blah.
So,

564
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:56,280
and it was Solomon and then Salami,
which is slowed down. It's been,

565
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:59,550
it's been months since we've done a
Persian voicemail and I'm just oh,

566
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:04,320
sad spot on my nose or something.
Lady knows that called saw them as well.

567
00:37:04,321 --> 00:37:07,710
We don't know cause we just, when you
lose hope with Salomon and she's like,

568
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,400
I don't know
that's somebody by the way,

569
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:13,890
I think I put it together
cause it's an older lady. Yeah.

570
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:18,180
If somebody that has all her friends'
phone numbers written down, interesting.

571
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:22,110
Every phone number in her life is written
down as a digit off and that's why

572
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:26,430
interesting theory. I like that. I
think it's just, she doesn't call,

573
00:37:26,431 --> 00:37:27,600
she opens her little booklet,

574
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:31,560
her old school handwritten shit possibly
supposed to be at three and it's an

575
00:37:31,561 --> 00:37:32,510
eight or something.
You know,

576
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:37,230
you remember that time she told Salami
to put plastic bags in the trees for the

577
00:37:37,231 --> 00:37:41,610
squirrels that it wards off score.
Somebody found photo of that.

578
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,960
That's something that people do.

579
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:47,990
You know crazy people do of course
is a squirrel problem that severe and

580
00:37:48,061 --> 00:37:52,200
pervasive in California looking
squirrels trying to get some food.

581
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:56,910
What do they do? What? What
damage do squirrels do? I
mean at least in city life,

582
00:37:56,911 --> 00:37:59,930
like, okay, they're kind of
annoying, but I do have this,

583
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,980
can I tell you what happened? Yeah,
yeah, of course. So for Atus I get,

584
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,100
I get a phone call yesterday
from an area code. I'm not,

585
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,830
I know I don't have friends in like,
this is not for me.

586
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:14,200
And I just let it go to voicemail because
I'm with little jeans and we're riding

587
00:38:14,201 --> 00:38:18,810
a train. It's cute. And then I get a
text from the number, it says hello.

588
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:23,790
And I was like, do I like who is
this? And I write back, who is this?

589
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:29,570
And this person just sends a photograph
of a $20 bill with just bricks of pills

590
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:37,370
and writes back Rick with the xannies
like,

591
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:42,520
oh, he's looking for, he's not
looking for Salamay or Schnoz.

592
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:48,970
Atus yeah. So I was tempted to write back
like, Bro, this is an eight is his phone.

593
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,480
But then I started, my maternal
instinct has kicked in where I'm like,

594
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:56,740
I don't want this dealer to know
that eight is, has changes number,

595
00:38:56,741 --> 00:38:58,300
because then he's just going
to fucking try to find him.

596
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,760
So I'm just going to not, I'm doing
radio silence on the drug dealer. Yeah.

597
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,610
Let him figure this out on his own.
I'm not going to help aid as get pills.

598
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,920
Of course. That's a ton of
Xanax though, if you guys are.

599
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,520
Wow. I didn't know. That's
how, I mean, I'm such a square,

600
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,920
like I'm not even sure what
Xanax looks like. Really.

601
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:25,960
I'm like this guy's, you know, for
a hundred of them in the metal,

602
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:30,030
that is so amazed. I got to really
cherish that one. Really Great.

603
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,740
So that was pretty exciting news.

604
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:37,810
We watched a good movie last
night for once and I fell asleep.

605
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:42,510
It was that good action
movie. English people. Yeah,
I really liked that one. Yeah.

606
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:47,170
And there were a lot of chapters in
it. The lead is a Chav, a Roadman,

607
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,190
a lot of road when we're in it,
rode men's

608
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:56,480
blood, fat, blood, blah, that there was a
couple blood and films in there. Really?

609
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:00,180
I couldn't even understand what the
henchman would be like. Blood, what?

610
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,590
I was drinking wine last night, so I
don't, I, I can't understand things.

611
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,460
Oh yeah. Watch the rest of that
soon. We rented it. You know,

612
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,410
right now we should have bought it.
It's a good one.

613
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,980
Told you we buy all the shitty movies.
Then we rent the good ones.

614
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,610
We own Jack reacher to
reach all the way back.

615
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,620
It wasn't available for Shitty
rent. Fuck. That movie's terrible.

616
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:28,020
Fuck that movie. I saw him that finished
it. I think I'm going to finish it.

617
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:33,670
I'm going to finish it. Jessica angry.
Watch the rest of that pile of shit.

618
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,460
I want to wish I watching.

619
00:40:36,461 --> 00:40:41,461
That movie really makes me wish I
knew Tom Cruise just so I could be uh,

620
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,890
um, call him and be like, how disappointed
are you in the way this turned out?

621
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:52,540
You would not do that if he was my friend.
You would not do that to a friend.

622
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,780
You don't do that to people do you know?

623
00:40:55,781 --> 00:40:59,950
But he's so I feel like he's the type that
would be like, he would be like, yeah,

624
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,440
the fucking director of fuck this one up.
Oh,

625
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:06,220
I feel like he would leave with that.
I think he's the kind of guy

626
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,510
that he's really,
cause he's in a,

627
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:13,960
he's in Scientology and
he's super positive.

628
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:16,570
Like he's one of those people that
say something negative. It's true.

629
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:20,060
Well I think it was really positive
experience because like he's one of those

630
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,170
roads, a lot of people that worked on
it and I'm so thankful to all of them.

631
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:29,170
One of those fucking horse shit.
Whenever people would credit the crew,

632
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,810
that's when I'm like,
uh,

633
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:36,540
main thing is I'm just happy to have
this crew back and I'm just happy that I

634
00:41:36,771 --> 00:41:39,710
was happy that these guys get to work.
Do they start doing that?

635
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,970
I'm sure that's what your main concerns.

636
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:46,030
My eyes can't real far back enough into
my head when I hear that that's what

637
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,070
Garth was doing last week.
Oh,

638
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:51,260
you know what's really great is that
everybody gets to see the grips and the

639
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:55,250
light guy like, no, you don't. One gives
a shit and neither do you know. Yeah,

640
00:41:55,910 --> 00:42:00,270
you're the star. They always say ego.
When shows get renewed. They're like,

641
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,120
the main thing is that, that uh, this
crew gets to work another season.

642
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,560
That's what that was the main,

643
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:09,620
I'm sure I was so worried about
like what are they going to do,

644
00:42:09,621 --> 00:42:14,000
like I'm taking care of, but like
these guys, that was my main concern.

645
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:19,500
Right. Yeah. I'm sure you're going
to make your wardrobe Mother Teresa.

646
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:24,050
I did find this from when I did get
gonorrhea, the first thing I kind of Rhea.

647
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:24,530
Yup.

648
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:25,363
Right.

649
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:32,010
Yeah. That was me taking a piss with
gunner. You never had an STD at all?

650
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,260
Not once. I mean, who knows.

651
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:38,650
We'll see what happens this
year in college or anything
like that. Never. Never,

652
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:43,500
never,
never.

653
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:47,580
I never have because I never
had sex with strangers.

654
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:52,640
People that I had a relationships with,
relationships with them. I had one eye.

655
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:57,690
What happened was I got bad bite
and I got sick. He got diarrhea.

656
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:02,820
He always knew your partner? Yeah. Yeah.
I was friends with the people I fucked.

657
00:43:02,821 --> 00:43:07,200
I never fucks rangers generally as a rule.
It's still my,

658
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:12,270
um, my, I guess my numbers
are pretty split on that,

659
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,530
so I'm sweating jurors like some
half strangers, half. I know you can.

660
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,420
Yeah. So gross. Oh yeah.

661
00:43:21,421 --> 00:43:25,770
I know one of your special strangers you
do you reminisce about her like once a

662
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:28,300
year? No, I don't. Oh yeah.

663
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:34,420
Reminisce about a stranger. I won't,
I won't say it on the air, but I'll,

664
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,780
I'll say this. It wasn't
a foreign country. Oh,

665
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:42,730
oh. See, look at your face
like I've talked about it.
I talked about it in my ass.

666
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,750
Yeah,
yeah,

667
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:50,020
yeah. That's what I'm fucking talking
about. You're still reminiscing.

668
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,340
It's not positive.
Yeah,

669
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:57,050
but you're still like ruminating
about this wonderful woman.

670
00:43:57,051 --> 00:44:00,200
You man making a greater point.
When I talk about her,

671
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:05,150
I'm making a bigger point to do it.
No, I'm going to have to watch the,

672
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:08,060
your new hour now to see what's going on.

673
00:44:08,061 --> 00:44:10,950
I haven't watched you do
standup in a while cause he'd
been out of the, you know,

674
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,690
we've been different cities, but yeah.
Wow. Look at that. See I was right.

675
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:16,370
She's always on your mind.

676
00:44:16,371 --> 00:44:20,300
This girl not always so special to
you and your hearts for real though,

677
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:25,910
Girl. Damn girl. Yeah,
you're in my heart. What,

678
00:44:25,911 --> 00:44:30,050
what about her? It's not her. You
bring out like what makes you,

679
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:34,280
it's not her reminiscent.
Finally. It's not that it's a Ma.

680
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:38,650
I'm making a point about women. Yeah. Um,

681
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:42,660
giving guys the go ahead
and how,

682
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,200
how women have to basically
be more vigilant than men.

683
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:48,360
Because if you're a guy,

684
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:53,540
there's just a point where you don't
rationally think where the peg you got

685
00:44:53,851 --> 00:44:57,300
gonorrhea from. I never
got gone to Rehab. Just,

686
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,061
no,
that's just,

687
00:45:00,061 --> 00:45:03,240
just the point that I made though at the
point that I make is just about that.

688
00:45:03,241 --> 00:45:04,130
It's not about it.

689
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,620
And you're absolutely right because
I remember as a young woman,

690
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:11,160
that dude's just,
all they want to do is come in you.

691
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:15,780
And she wasn't the only one who was like,
yeah, don't worry about it. Hell no,

692
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:20,100
no, no, no, no. She wasn't the
only one. Right. So dangerous.

693
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:24,090
Other floozies that I was with that
were like, don't worry about it. Yeah.

694
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,230
Yeah. We used to call your
sisters Luddy and scanty. Yeah.

695
00:45:28,231 --> 00:45:31,710
There's still saved in my phone like that.
They got so mad. Maria was just like,

696
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:34,500
whatever. Jane was like,
that's disgusting. She,

697
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:37,260
she thought this whole time
he brought this up last week,

698
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,670
she thought this whole time I had
her saved in my phone as cunt.

699
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:47,250
She goes, she was just like so fucking
rude. They used to call me conti and I go,

700
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,150
oh my God, you can teach me know. Yes,
you'd like. She was so adamant. I go,

701
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:56,610
the nickname was [inaudible] like
a skunk. Yeah. And she was like,

702
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:01,740
Oh really? I go, yeah, you thought
it was con? She goes, yes. No,

703
00:46:01,741 --> 00:46:05,860
it was scanty and Ludie.
Well, that makes sense now.

704
00:46:05,861 --> 00:46:09,540
And when she was so upset about that,
she was like, this is so fucking rude.

705
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,030
Gosh,
I know you're a scant,

706
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:15,900
but now this scares me for our son
because all these hoes will be like,

707
00:46:15,901 --> 00:46:18,120
you can just blow loads in me and then,
oh,

708
00:46:18,121 --> 00:46:22,260
I'm preggers now your life is over and
you're at an 18 year old boy or 16 year

709
00:46:22,261 --> 00:46:26,940
old boy. Well, okay. How do you
convince a young man to wear a rubber?

710
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,210
It's tough. I don't know, man.
We've got to use scare tactics.

711
00:46:30,211 --> 00:46:31,560
I think that's what I was just thinking.
Now,

712
00:46:31,561 --> 00:46:35,250
what can we say to him
that'll scare him enough?

713
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:40,170
Erash it's gotta be like right now I'll
take them down to skid row and you're

714
00:46:40,171 --> 00:46:43,570
like, all these people didn't
work out. And he's like, what?

715
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:47,850
He started doing it like six years old.
It was really impressionable.

716
00:46:47,851 --> 00:46:51,390
And every year you're like, I'm
going to go to no condom row. Oh,

717
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,640
that end drugs. You want
it, you would take pot.

718
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,690
This is what it looks like when you take
pie and be homeless or pregnant with

719
00:47:00,691 --> 00:47:01,410
you.
Pregnant people are like,

720
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:06,410
they took about it took pot and they
smoked drugs and then the baby's growing

721
00:47:07,781 --> 00:47:10,830
inside of you when you do that.
Yeah. That was the guys to

722
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:17,910
scare him. We'll say it makes your teeth
fall out to those tee ball and be like,

723
00:47:17,911 --> 00:47:22,230
yeah, if you don't wear a condom,
teeth fall out to fall out. Yup.

724
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:27,030
Did you drugs? She's full out. It does.
Right enough. We got to get on that soon,

725
00:47:27,031 --> 00:47:29,300
showing him pictures and I
will still be that thing.

726
00:47:29,301 --> 00:47:34,090
So we feel really don't tell him that.
Stoops. Yeah. What's wrong? What?

727
00:47:34,091 --> 00:47:37,930
You good man. Don't please. Um,

728
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,080
by the way,
I think of anything.

729
00:47:41,081 --> 00:47:42,730
This is one of my favorite
things that come in and a while.

730
00:47:42,731 --> 00:47:47,140
You remember obviously, right? Of course
you can't. I remember I was duct tape.

731
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:52,270
Yup. Guy Died. I'm so fired up.

732
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,610
So fire.
We have Korean food after this.

733
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:58,760
You're always in the Korean food cause
I have to shit, check this out. Yeah.

734
00:47:59,080 --> 00:47:59,970
This is crazy,
man.

735
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,690
I mean he probably had ever,
ever opportunity to put
a brown paper poke over.

736
00:48:03,691 --> 00:48:08,600
Isn't hey ed can poke holes in
it or a plastic bag, you know,

737
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:12,680
but duct tape.
I mean

738
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:17,790
it's,
it's just unbelievable.

739
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:19,620
People don't think this really happened.

740
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,720
This guy.
Oh God robbed the place with his face.

741
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:29,410
It's wrapped in duct tape and duct tape.
Hmm.

742
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:32,130
Isn't that insane to you?
Something tells me drug us.

743
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:36,090
We're responsible for that decision.
Yeah, a little bit. Of course.

744
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:41,130
Duct tape, man. Chuck
tape. It's bad. Yeah.

745
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:44,380
Bad. And it gets even more unbelievable
during a jailhouse interview.

746
00:48:44,381 --> 00:48:47,110
The suspect said police
have the wrong guy.

747
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,440
Yeah.
Here he is.

748
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:53,670
They call you the tape bandage.
That's not, you look at me.

749
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:57,060
Don't look like a duck tape
Ben and baby. I'm not. No.

750
00:48:57,061 --> 00:49:01,560
Duct tape banding loud one on one acid.
It's sucky.

751
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:06,090
You know this is not me. Now Look
Dude Mad. Do the homework, man.

752
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:12,300
He's got to go ask the
day pass duct tape tape.

753
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,640
I mean this is an insane

754
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:18,950
police. Say the suspect. It's
totally him. What? Lucky.

755
00:49:18,951 --> 00:49:22,790
Apparently the bandit was sweating so
much. The duct tape didn't quite stick,

756
00:49:22,791 --> 00:49:24,200
but of course he's not all that lucky.

757
00:49:24,201 --> 00:49:28,260
Police say they have enough evidence
to make the charges stick butter. Yeah.

758
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,740
Yeah,
that's definitely duct tape.

759
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:34,580
I like his approach to the f to denying
it though. Hey man, it's not me.

760
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,190
Look at me man. Look at me.
You know me man. You know

761
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,390
me loud one on one sucky.
You know this is not me,

762
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,950
but God Dang.

763
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:54,380
Yeah, it is a good defense.
Take bandaid unreal man. Shit.

764
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:59,840
Go ask the day,
judge.

765
00:49:59,841 --> 00:50:03,780
Do you know what I'm saying? Right, right
there. Shit. Amy, I'll tell you right now,

766
00:50:03,781 --> 00:50:08,330
one on one man is that he
said one on one on one.

767
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,790
One on one. I didn't know
that. You said live one on one,

768
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:13,710
like maybe his radio station.
Okay.

769
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:17,800
One on one as if it's sucky.
You know, this is not me.

770
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:20,650
Oh fuck that guy saying,
oh he's a master vaccine,

771
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:24,590
but all I know is that this is another
guy that it's in a duct tape Dev.

772
00:50:24,591 --> 00:50:25,880
That is an insane,

773
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:30,080
you imagine all these could cover your
face with how much that would hurt to

774
00:50:30,081 --> 00:50:33,860
take that off. That
would hurt so bad. Yeah.

775
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:36,980
I mean I don't think just your face.
What about when you're,

776
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,160
when it's coming off the back
of your head. Oh Fuck Shit.

777
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,500
I was even worried putting
on that fetish mask.

778
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:46,040
You wear it when you weren't the live
show. Cause I thought bring down the back.

779
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:50,240
Oh, well and also it's, you know,
it's sticky. Yeah, you could.

780
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:53,780
I thought people put Vaseline on their
hair. B or something. I don't know.

781
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:56,950
But duct tape. Duct tape. There's
no way you pull it out. It

782
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:03,500
hurts for her so bad. Yeah.
That's even a bandaid hurts.

783
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:08,990
Could you imagine that tape?
What's Your Pronoun? Oh, does it?

784
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,760
Oh, it just, may I plug my
shell this week? Please do.

785
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:16,810
So I actually spoke to a nonbinary person
on this week's episode of that deep

786
00:51:17,301 --> 00:51:21,500
bro. It drops a Monday night at
Minnesota. By the time this is up,

787
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:25,340
it will be there and it's on, I have a
youtube video, it's on my youtube channel.

788
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,180
Um, so listen to that seat
bro. And I, it was pretty,

789
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:34,660
pretty informative and it makes a lot
more sense now and actually hear it.

790
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,150
Yeah, they are. They, they did it.

791
00:51:37,151 --> 00:51:40,640
I asked for the Pronoun and they did say
they'd prefer to be for Jews today. So,

792
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:44,810
uh, they were very kind
and generous and very cool.

793
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:48,770
Good sense of humor about it too.
Yeah, that's sounds super cool.

794
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:52,700
Check it out this week, just like,
hey. Hi. How are you? What's your name?

795
00:51:52,701 --> 00:51:56,810
What's Your Pronoun? So we'll check that
out. That's deep, Bro. Um, all right.

796
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:57,823
Second announcement

797
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:03,580

803
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:27,440
Fourth and final show has been
added at the Vic in Chicago.

804
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:31,560
March 19th. That is it. There's no more.

805
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:36,090
Thank you Chicago for all your support.
Uh, if you haven't gotten tickets,

806
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:39,390
now is your chance.
There is three weeks until the show.

month because the original next day would

813
00:53:06,231 --> 00:53:07,350

He really enunciates.
Your Dad's got a broadcaster's voice.

847
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,340
I was in ranch.com it was big

848
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:23,820
mushy purples. Yeah, he
really says it well. Yeah,

849
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,030
you're very handsome. I love
you. Thank you. I love you too.

850
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,720
I'd like to be with you. I want to
be with you. Don't give me gonorrhea.

851
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,790
Don't fund my friends,
Dude.

852
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,470
She had bad dreams about me and
then hate me a little bit. The next

853
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,960
I've had. Yes, but not, it
was never carried in cause
I've woken up and be like, oh,

854
00:55:40,961 --> 00:55:44,980
that was a dream. Yeah, but it's
unconscious. It's just I can't help it.

855
00:55:44,981 --> 00:55:48,130
Jean Jean, I had jeans, my new favorite.

856
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,420
Unless you make some new friends you have
nothing to worry about because no one

857
00:55:51,421 --> 00:55:52,250
is going to be,

858
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:56,500
come on. No, we don't like my
friends cause they're not blondes.

859
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:01,220
No one's going to the dog pound.
They're not dogs, they're just Burnett.

860
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,560
They're all grumpy brunettes.
We're just having to be,

861
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:08,470
the best question I get asked all the
time is what makes monads pizzas so

862
00:56:08,471 --> 00:56:12,100
different and it's not really that easy
of a question to answer without going

863
00:56:12,101 --> 00:56:13,270
into a little bit of detail,

864
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:17,710
please don't go behind the scenes and
take a look at what we do with our cheese.

865
00:56:17,711 --> 00:56:21,840
What we do with our Dell, what we do with
our tomatoes can make this pizza union.

866
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:23,980
Our cheese is an piece of the

867
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,813
puzzle.

868
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:29,320
It's the middle child bridging the gap
between the crust and the toxic glue that

869
00:56:29,321 --> 00:56:32,680
holds it all together.
It's, it's delicious.

870
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:38,390
It is a beautiful thing to watch a master
cheesemaker preside over at new master

871
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,333
ways.

872
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:44,080
Just watching every step in a way to
make sure it's perfect and they have made

873
00:56:44,081 --> 00:56:48,910
us great.
When we talk about Mozzarella cheese.

874
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:53,830
Oh God. We're talking about a
product that it needs to be creamy.

875
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:58,770
Duh. Yeah. Yeah. What's the fucking
say? Well, it's like, I don't know.

876
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:03,890
Good. His cheese is really fucking,
I do. I do want to try it now. Right?

877
00:57:03,891 --> 00:57:06,830
Don't you think this guy is probably,
it's probably a pretty good, right? What?

878
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:09,620
Do we know the, is this la? No, no.

879
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:15,350
It's creamy. Buttery. Oh,
you get a little teary,

880
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:20,330
Rudy. Well, no, no. Naughty.
Oh, stop it. Stop it. Really,

881
00:57:20,331 --> 00:57:21,660
really good.
You're annoying.

882
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:26,343
Really

883
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:29,770
stop it. Yeah, it's Monatiz. That's gross.

884
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:34,270
That's really gross.
It was super boring and it's boring.

885
00:57:34,271 --> 00:57:37,810
And he's a boner is an exciting topic
that he made. Boring. How's that possible?

886
00:57:37,811 --> 00:57:42,670
You can make pizza and we look
forward. My favorite one of these, um,

887
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:45,730
was the one we did at the live
show where she's like dry ponds.

888
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:47,950
Now you may have heard of dry ponds,
right?

889
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:51,970
But the dry ponds in this dry pond
is a dry pond. Yeah. Oh my God.

890
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,580
[inaudible] pond is where there
used to be water. It's also,

891
00:57:54,581 --> 00:57:58,870
it was like really obvious, but you know,
when there's water, but then there isn't,

892
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:03,370
now it's a dry pond. Yeah, no, I
got it. Yeah, it was so boring.

893
00:58:03,371 --> 00:58:07,750
And dry pounds can be either dry or ponds,
but they're not both dry ponds.

894
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:10,450
They're like, yeah, what are you talking
about? So when the water goes away,

895
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:13,810
now it's a dry pond. You're
like, Yep, that's how you do it.

896
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:19,420
Teaching us about drive. How can we talk
about sink holes for a minute? Yeah.

897
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:23,560
I don't understand what's happening with
the sinkhole. Why don't you understand?

898
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,470
Well, we had a huge storms
and la this last weekend.

899
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:30,280
And then in studio city they said there
was a sinkhole and that just means that

900
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:34,090
what the earth just collapses and
sucks in everything around it.

901
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:38,870
Particular area. I mean, the
answer is simply yes. Uh,

902
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:43,900
there was a sinkhole that it opened
on the street level and below it was,

903
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:47,990
you know, the, uh, what's it
called? Like the, the water,

904
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:53,210
what is it that runs through
underneath the tunnel? The,

905
00:58:53,211 --> 00:58:57,500
uh, you know, I forget what
it's called anyways. Yeah.

906
00:58:57,501 --> 00:59:01,760
It was like sewage lines basically
like an open flooded. So the water, uh,

907
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:04,820
it was raining so much, right. That, um,

908
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:08,240
I guess that area was just
susceptible to it swallowed two cars.

909
00:59:08,241 --> 00:59:11,130
Did you see that? That's what I'm
saying. So, okay. So basically it gets,

910
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:14,210
sometimes there's sinkholes in that area.

911
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:18,380
It was above like a
functioning, um, you know,

912
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:22,480
sewage system line. Okay. So then that
breaks down and they think it sucks in,

913
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:26,990
okay. There are sinkholes
that happened just, you know,

914
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:30,070
terrain opens up. That's what
the fuck I'm talking about. Yeah.

915
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:33,740
Like when we used to live by the beach,
I would walk to the ocean. It was one,

916
00:59:33,741 --> 00:59:38,030
one time on the beach. Yeah. Dude. Like
just out of nowhere, the sand collapses.

917
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:41,690
And you're like, how does that even,
how, why? And how does that even happen?

918
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,130
This shit is,
is uh,

919
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:48,270
no crazy. Crazier than a
motherfucker, man. Ooh,

920
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:52,310
this is ray. We need, um,

921
00:59:52,311 --> 00:59:55,530
we need a boring video to explain
sinkholes to us. Look one up.

922
00:59:56,430 --> 01:00:00,090
Let's see how you is one.
Oh,

923
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,390
what's your tongue of bad?
Crazy.

924
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:07,880
Let's see. Let's go. Um,

925
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,790
this same as this one seems to vary.

926
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,620
Our scientists have discovered evidence
in rock layers to date or history on a

927
01:00:16,621 --> 01:00:21,480
geological timescale at
about 4.6 billion years old.

928
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:27,050
These scientists borings have internal
and external energies already tapped out

929
01:00:28,531 --> 01:00:33,360
the various land structures of these
energies or for shorter version

930
01:00:33,361 --> 01:00:36,180
constructive from this
map of the United States,

931
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:41,270
sinkholes occur in different regions
all across the USA and beyond.

932
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,390
Worldwide,
Huh?

933
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:48,300
Okay. Did you see that one called how
scary sinkholes are freaking thank you.

934
01:00:48,301 --> 01:00:51,450
And better at any time. Yeah. I
don't understanding our intro.

935
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,660
This guy's gonna drag it down.
Yeah, we're going to learn words.

936
01:00:57,661 --> 01:00:58,920
I can understand here for d news,

937
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:02,370
people and sink holes are now in
my list of things I fear most.

938
01:01:02,371 --> 01:01:07,371
Right under trapped by a wildfire
and above giant spider attacks.

939
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:13,230
Prison sinkholes. This reason a man
was asleep in bed in his Florida home.

940
01:01:13,231 --> 01:01:17,730
It's totally the earth gave way
under his house. It was a sinkhole.

941
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:20,640
He screamed for his brother
who rushed in to save him.

942
01:01:20,641 --> 01:01:24,350
But even with those few seconds,
it was too long. Kind of help.

943
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:27,960
I know the best way to get over it.
A fear of something is to get to know it.

944
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:30,090
So here goes.
All right.

945
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:34,590
Sinkholes happen when the bedrock of the
earth is slowly worn away by erosion.

946
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:38,010
It's particularly common in places that
are built mostly on limestone because

947
01:01:38,011 --> 01:01:42,180
it's so susceptible to that erosion
under the topsoil is a layer called the

948
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:46,110
overburden. Then under that is
bedrock, which sounds tough and solid,

949
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:50,820
but it's actually filled with cracks
and crevices. Water's constantly,

950
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,970
legally the water, the water,
water eats away at the rock.

951
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:59,640
The fucking water gums in,
Huh?

952
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:04,050
Snotty. Even you saying like
it wasn't so much water,

953
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:08,910
they wouldn't, yeah. Laughs
we got to deport the water.

954
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:13,560
It's raining too much, man. We gotta
get rid of all the water rounded up.

955
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:16,630
Oddly enough, everyone's always
complaining about a drought here. Yeah.

956
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:24,450
What the surface is a thin crust of soil
until the person walks over at course,

957
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:27,160
cause it all collapses.
Sinkholes.

958
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:30,460
In 2010 Guatemala City was
hit by Hurricane Agatha,

959
01:02:30,461 --> 01:02:32,920
and after being slammed
with 45 mile an hour winds,

960
01:02:32,921 --> 01:02:37,020
the rain finally proved too much
and caused this gaping hole. Oh,

961
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:41,260
an entire factory. The thing is, you
feed across and like a hundred feet deep.

962
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:45,340
It looks Photoshop. It most
definitely. Whoa, dude. Scary.

963
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:47,050
Luckily no one was injured.

964
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:51,790
Guatemala City is built on ancient
volcanic ash and pumice just Kinda like

965
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:56,410
gravel. And when it erodes, this happens.
That's not, and it could happen anytime.

966
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:01,510
Anytime a hard rain comes or whatever.
There's nothing they can do. Singles,

967
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:04,090
sinkholes aren't always
caused by rain or nature.

968
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:07,690
Sometimes humans screw things up.
We're pretty good at that.

969
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:12,250
Broken sewer pipes flooded. Mozzies are
underground records been known to come?

970
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:13,860
Is it?
You know what's crazy too is like,

971
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:18,000
there's always this illusion that
everything's fine. Don't worry about,

972
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:22,120
we're in constant chaos any
moment. You know, it's, it's,

973
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:26,430
it's a weird way about how the earth,
the world,

974
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:31,410
even in modern times, is susceptible
to its origins. In other words,

975
01:03:31,411 --> 01:03:35,940
the natural state. I don't have
many buildings with Nia. You know,

976
01:03:35,941 --> 01:03:39,300
big biotron signs, you go
like, well now it's modern,

977
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:42,800
but like the earth can still open
up and swallow you. Right Bro.

978
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,980
I was fucking divas. Fuck.
And you're right. Yeah. Cause
we can build technology.

979
01:03:46,981 --> 01:03:50,010
We can say that we have control.
We have no control over her mother nature.

980
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:54,150
She can fucking zero do a tornado.
A Tornado.

981
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:56,640
Fucking earthquake. Dude, forget it.

982
01:03:56,970 --> 01:04:01,720
Good luck with your fancy freeways and
your buildings. When that shit happens,

983
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:05,490
earth opens up. That's what's up. Go Walk.

984
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:06,623
Yeah,

985
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:09,840
yeah,
no shit.

986
01:04:09,841 --> 01:04:13,170
I remember it in the big earthquake
in 1994 when that happened here in la,

987
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:16,920
freeways just collapsed on top
of freeways. And guess what?

988
01:04:16,921 --> 01:04:20,280
If you're fucking under it, like
you're just dead, you're dead.

989
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,810
You know the one thing about that is,

990
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,480
it's much scarier is that their sudden
I lived through a bunch of hurricanes.

991
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:31,470
I hate that Florida. That's
terrifying piece. You have warnings.

992
01:04:31,471 --> 01:04:32,460
You know the warnings.

993
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,430
That changes a lot because they're like
a hurricane is coming and then you're

994
01:04:35,431 --> 01:04:39,630
just fucking dumb if you're around for it.
But why do people stay?

995
01:04:39,631 --> 01:04:42,770
Because there are people that
I've learned over time. It's a,

996
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:45,570
it's a mixture of dumb people,
poor people.

997
01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:47,940
Because poor people
really think about like,

998
01:04:47,941 --> 01:04:51,030
I don't have the means to
travel or stay somewhere.

999
01:04:51,031 --> 01:04:53,670
I never thought about that for
a long time, but it is true.

1000
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:56,940
But then there are dummies like there
are one zero like I don't give a fuck.

1001
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:00,420
You know what? I didn't get killed
last time. I sure shit like that.

1002
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:05,130
And then they stick around and
die like don't Dan race. Yeah.

1003
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:08,280
They risk it and then they just
get screwed. I wish we could,

1004
01:05:08,281 --> 01:05:09,990
I mean they've tried forever.

1005
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:14,100
They've been trying forever to
develop an earthquake system.

1006
01:05:14,101 --> 01:05:17,260
Like they could give us warning at least
like a few minutes because that would

1007
01:05:17,261 --> 01:05:18,490
help tremendously.

1008
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:24,070
But you're, you're just fucking
screwed dude. It's fucking,
yeah, it's a nightmare.

1009
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:28,000
That's why I don't like doing much.
I feel like the less I do the safe right,

1010
01:05:28,001 --> 01:05:31,930
I am better you can do is like, just
stay home all the time. All the time.

1011
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:35,120
Our House is super safe. We're safe
in here. I feel like. Think so.

1012
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:38,980
Unless there's a sinkhole beneath us.
So I think about that every night.

1013
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:40,330
Put that in your dreams.

1014
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:44,800
Put me with one of your friends having
sex in a sinkhole and your dreams real

1015
01:05:44,801 --> 01:05:47,140
scared.
The good news is you have life insurance.

1016
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:50,530
Please make some better looking
friends paid. They're all good looking.

1017
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:55,600
They're just brunettes. Blondes.
You got a bunch of fucking

1018
01:05:57,380 --> 01:05:58,213
what about

1019
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,080
not true of everyone about that?
And I'm like,

1020
01:06:05,081 --> 01:06:09,040
all your friends are here by your dog
pound and your fucking dog friends.

1021
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:14,050
Maybe your friends are Bowser's.
I got g Q squad is, oh, bullshit.

1022
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:16,390
The bt Gq.

1023
01:06:16,391 --> 01:06:21,391
The Big Tom is quarters
there elects the Hobo squad.

1024
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:25,690
That's your fucking squad.
That's what you're into. You
liked. You liked that Hobo.

1025
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:31,150
I am actually more to do it for you. How
both score Hobo looking guy. I'm like,

1026
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:34,570
my wife would like you to
come over, do it for you, man.

1027
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:39,100
Just like stupid.
Just like the gate.

1028
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:45,130
I was like, would you ever
one date your mom? Yes.

1029
01:06:45,131 --> 01:06:49,240
I hope those people fall into singles. A
dumb dumbs. You want to see a dad boner,

1030
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:52,120
a lightning strike?
I always,

1031
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:03,683
yes,

1032
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:09,513
I know.

1033
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:13,870
Excited Dad is my favorite thing.
A blue band.

1034
01:07:13,871 --> 01:07:18,190
Can you put a compilation together of
all excited dad footage that we've had so

1035
01:07:18,191 --> 01:07:21,490
many excited dad master
compilation of this shit.

1036
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:35,170
Is he a professional professional?

1037
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:41,680
It looks like he's in a broadcasting
kind of jacket and he's outside.

1038
01:07:41,681 --> 01:07:43,840
It's snowing like crazy.
I mean there's,

1039
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:47,290
I don't know how much snow was on the
ground and there's lightening and that's

1040
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:49,060
his reaction every time he sees light.

1041
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:50,983
Yes.

1042
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:03,480
Why is he so stoked about it? It seems
like he's at the television Guy, right?

1043
01:08:03,481 --> 01:08:07,920
There's somebody behind them and not
like a home video isn't a home video I've

1044
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:12,270
really picked up there.
You gotta be kidding.

1045
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:16,100
How can this guy,
how does

1046
01:08:16,110 --> 01:08:20,200
have a job looks terrible out there. I
would go inside. Yeah, it's horrible.

1047
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:25,250
You can have your $500 million Jackpot
and powerball or whatever the heck it was.

1048
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:30,370
But I'll take this baby for four
lightening strikes for episodes of thunder

1049
01:08:30,561 --> 01:08:31,200
snow.

1050
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:35,340
Okay. Thunder snow. Huh? That's
his shots. His Jam under snow.

1051
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:37,980
Most people watch lightening strike.

1052
01:08:37,981 --> 01:08:42,340
He would rather not have a half a billion
dollars. He just said, then see like

1053
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:49,680
you can have your jackpot. I just saw
lightning strike four times. Yeah.

1054
01:08:49,681 --> 01:08:51,600
I don't feel like it's that exciting.
I feel like I've seen,

1055
01:08:51,601 --> 01:08:54,460
hopefully not that exciting
and I'm excited for him. Yeah.

1056
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:56,280
But I'm not that excited neither.

1057
01:08:56,281 --> 01:09:01,110
I would stab him in front of his children
to get $500 million. So what I, yeah,

1058
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:02,323
he's crazy.

1059
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:07,240
I mean, this is just a total change. Not
only was it an hour was shot another one.

1060
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:11,860
What's up? Oh my goodness.
That's number six.

1061
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:17,500
You've gotta be kidding me. I
tell you, this is Chicago books,

1062
01:09:17,501 --> 01:09:20,980
Jealousy, Chicago all over again.
We're just sitting in the middle of it,

1063
01:09:21,330 --> 01:09:23,490
just like all over. So he's in. Wow. Wow.

1064
01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:26,250
I've never seen someone get
this excited about lightning.

1065
01:09:26,310 --> 01:09:29,640
It's really exciting for him. There's
nothing more exciting on earth and that,

1066
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:33,830
is there anything you could get this
stoked about? I mean, I don't, you know,

1067
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:38,080
it's like he has one passion and
it's fucking lighten this jam. Yeah.

1068
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:39,470
You know what I'd be excited about?

1069
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:44,380
Oh Dude. That's number
six. I like the baby.

1070
01:09:45,070 --> 01:09:49,130
I'd like to see the Aurora borealis.
Yeah, but there's no Alaska be cool.

1071
01:09:49,131 --> 01:09:52,030
You ever react like, I mean, I've seen
you go about that. I'm trying to think.

1072
01:09:52,050 --> 01:09:54,820
I get excited about the dads.
Yeah. You guys side by seeing them.

1073
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:57,970
I don't know if there's anything that
you feel that passionate about it like

1074
01:09:57,971 --> 01:09:59,410
that.
Like that.

1075
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:03,040
Like that time I met Kim deal
from the pixies was pretty amazed.

1076
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:05,260
I was really excited about that.

1077
01:10:05,261 --> 01:10:08,220
You're fun to surprise cause you
get excited on surprises. Yeah.

1078
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:11,570
Time I flew your friend out.
That was the best day on her side.

1079
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:15,100
That was the most exciting time.
Yeah. That was super fun. Yeah. Yeah.

1080
01:10:15,101 --> 01:10:18,880
That was a good surprise. Yeah. That
was so clever. She's cute by the way.

1081
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,730
She's totally cute. I no kidding
me. She doesn't live here.

1082
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:25,720
You know they can't banger.
Exactly. Fly around, but exactly.

1083
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:29,380
I'm talking about you're accessible.
Dog Pound. Oh, you're so stupid.

1084
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:31,400
Which one of your friends
is a winner there?

1085
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:34,660
Which one of your friends is
a big catch? Let me see. Huh?

1086
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:36,950
They're all fucking your friends.
Yeah.

1087
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:41,220
Well shot another one.
Wow.

1088
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:46,920
Fucking heard. Yeah, he's a super
nerd. What can, I'm not, I mean,

1089
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:50,040
Brussels Griffon I'm so our son,

1090
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:55,410
but even like look at Ellis do that
would make me that. Yeah. Know,

1091
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:59,790
like the boy makes us pretty excited.
Yeah. Yeah. With good reason.

1092
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:04,880
Yeah. But no, I don't, I don't see us. I
don't know. I definitely don't get that.

1093
01:11:04,881 --> 01:11:08,100
You always make fun of me for not
excited. You have no feelings. Oh,

1094
01:11:08,101 --> 01:11:10,050
that's not true.
That I have no feelings.

1095
01:11:10,051 --> 01:11:14,730
You don't have excitement or I assume
you get excited watching games now.

1096
01:11:14,731 --> 01:11:18,100
There was, you know what you get
excited about. Yeah. Football, um,

1097
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:22,710
killers like serial killer murder shows.
I don't get excited about them.

1098
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:27,180
You never get, I mean, it's literally
like, Tom, I'm pregnant. And you're like,

1099
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:31,830
oh yeah, no, that's also a lie.
You're a fucking liar. You exaggerate.

1100
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:34,150
You weren't as excited as fake news,
fake news.

1101
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:39,000
You weren't as excited as I thought
you'd be when I announced like pregnancy.

1102
01:11:39,001 --> 01:11:43,530
You were like, well, that's
great. Yeah, great. Yeah,

1103
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:45,870
I'm going to barbecue.
And then you barbecued,

1104
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:51,720
you went outside and you barbecued.
That's not true. I didn't go.

1105
01:11:51,721 --> 01:11:56,130
That's great news. I'm going
to barbecue. That's not neat.

1106
01:11:56,580 --> 01:12:00,180
I didn't say you didn't get super
stoked and then you're like, all right,

1107
01:12:00,181 --> 01:12:04,110
and then you just start a
barbecuing. I remember. Oh
full of shit. What do you get?

1108
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:05,460
You don't get excited.
No,

1109
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:09,840
you like rappers and stuff like you
get stuck when you meet rappers.

1110
01:12:09,841 --> 01:12:12,450
Not like that, but yeah,
I got excited. Come on.

1111
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:15,520
I got excited when we were having a baby

1112
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:22,740
toy. Please back. Like I wasn't excited.

1113
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:28,650
Speaking of babies in a baby doing this.
Let's see how it is.

1114
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:29,753
Yup.

1115
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:44,320
Tanya. Tanya said, yeah, this
is Tanya. Okay, excellent work,

1116
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,240
Tanya.
Getting them young.

1117
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:56,320
It's a cute kid. Your kid. Cute
little glass and kid. Totally.

1118
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,380
Um,
oh.

1119
01:12:58,770 --> 01:13:03,030
So apparently this is
you God doing standup.

1120
01:13:03,090 --> 01:13:06,000
I don't want to hear it. I don't
want to see it. Whatever it is.

1121
01:13:06,001 --> 01:13:09,480
It's stupid having vocal
fry. Oh, shut the front door.

1122
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:12,120
Let's see what it says here.
Stop it.

1123
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:17,230
Please submit evidence of Christina's
vocal snippets of her old standards.

1124
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:23,180
Okay. You're so shitty. I won't, I won't
put it up, but let's do here for a sec.

1125
01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:28,710
Wait a sec. Let's see if you have vocal
fry, please don't play. It went like this.

1126
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:34,240
Okay, fine. Great. There's my vocal
fi. So you had it. There was probably,

1127
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:39,840
I was probably going low in
the register. Oh, that's true.

1128
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:43,180
All right,
that's on a punchline.

1129
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:48,810
I have the video. Would you like
to see the new? No, I don't.

1130
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:54,840
I don't want to see the video
you have. Um, you have stand up.

1131
01:13:54,841 --> 01:13:56,380
Especially,
I don't want to slow,

1132
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,860
painful the kind of person
that enjoys everything I do.

1133
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:04,500
I love your bag. 10 years
old, Babe. Love your bed.

1134
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:08,140
That's when we lived in the
Rampart division. I had banks.
What's took a quick, no,

1135
01:14:08,141 --> 01:14:12,190
I don't want to watch my old jokes.
Let's please don't go quick.

1136
01:14:12,191 --> 01:14:15,220
You're an asshole and I'm going
to get you back if you do it.

1137
01:14:15,221 --> 01:14:18,800
We're watching your first year. I'm going
to find that you got all your standup.

1138
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:22,690
By the way, if every fucking thing you've
ever done on CD, you'd VHS. Can we,

1139
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:26,240
can we do this though? No. Let me
finish my sentence. Whatever it is. No.

1140
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:32,230
Can we pull it up and pause it just so
I can look at you so I can look at your

1141
01:14:32,231 --> 01:14:37,060
hair? You're lying because I know
we'll do, I've known him for 12 years,

1142
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:41,100
so it's muted me in it.
The volume on the volume.

1143
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:44,020
I just want to look at your hair.
Oh my God. It's so embarrassing.

1144
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:48,280
This was a badge. Ah, I had good teeth
though. And look at those gold earrings.

1145
01:14:48,281 --> 01:14:51,550
What phase is like going through?
God that's so old.

1146
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:55,220
That hair like a skinny. I was,
I was wearing a name nameplate.

1147
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:59,710
My mom gave me from Brooklyn. Oh
yeah. I was wearing big goals.

1148
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:03,910
Who've earrings, gas. Going through
like a, some kind of, I was wearing um,

1149
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:07,870
rockoware a lot that year for some reason.
I don't know what,

1150
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:12,630
what kind of phases was man. Yeah,
I look good though. You look great.

1151
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:16,720
Skinny Tan. This is when we first
started dating. Did you look great?

1152
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:20,650
It's like 10 years ago, bu
wait more. This is when I was,

1153
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:25,470
when we first started dating,
I went to Korea this year.
To do stand up. Uh, that's,

1154
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:27,070
yeah,
you went to Korea after we,

1155
01:15:27,071 --> 01:15:31,070
I mean this is right when I was
working as a writer. Still you look,

1156
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:35,560
I was working at a bakery [inaudible]
the name of the company that was working

1157
01:15:35,561 --> 01:15:39,880
as a writer. I've got my spank
bank ready to go. Great. Nice.

1158
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:43,480
Banks are not a good look
for me. I thought they were
great. I loved those banks.

1159
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:48,430
Are you fucking serious? No. Serious. Yes.
I like it. They're really uncomfortable.

1160
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:52,510
I don't care about that. I care that it
looks really, it looks so comfortable.

1161
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:54,220
It's uncomfortable because they,

1162
01:15:54,370 --> 01:15:58,570
they grow past your eyebrows really
fast and then you have to constantly get

1163
01:15:58,571 --> 01:15:59,404
them trimmed.

1164
01:16:00,070 --> 01:16:02,770
It's like the never ending quest to
keep your banks the right length.

1165
01:16:02,771 --> 01:16:04,960
And if they get too long
then they're in your eyes.

1166
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:08,770
It's sucks you got hair
in your face all the time.

1167
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:12,810
With banks from, was I
thinking a name plate? Oh,

1168
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:15,310
that was the time sex in
the city who was begging.

1169
01:16:15,430 --> 01:16:19,720
Everyone was wearing when cause Sarah
Jessica Parker had one situation that is

1170
01:16:19,721 --> 01:16:24,580
so old. My tits were great. You
know why they weren't that big?

1171
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:29,440
They were cs cause I was skinnier. I was
about 10 pounds lighter than I am now.

1172
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:34,760
And My tits were manageable.
Maybe Ds One D. Yeah.

1173
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:39,370
Tan. No wrinkles yet. Oh Man.

1174
01:16:39,371 --> 01:16:44,080
Now's a good time. Look how cute. I was
back to confident too for that long ago.

1175
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:45,570
You're supercar thank,

1176
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:49,790
I could tell were not even leading
myself until like the way that your pool,

1177
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:53,590
that's a Rocka wear jacket.
Fucking eye contact.

1178
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:57,010
This was a disaster,
this comedy time.

1179
01:16:57,250 --> 01:17:02,250
So these people would tape your sets
and everyone's signed away their their

1180
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:06,910
rights 10 years ago and if you
bombed that night, they didn't care.

1181
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:10,430
So, and then you'd ask them, can you take
that fucking down? They're like, nope.

1182
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:14,390
You signed the paperwork and they fucked
over so many comics who ate shit on

1183
01:17:14,391 --> 01:17:18,800
Carlton Stream it now. So they get
paid on that. Such fucking turds.

1184
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:20,000
I would never do that again.

1185
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,970
Think we didn't know it was like the
beginning of the Internet when people were

1186
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:26,020
putting Stanhope up. Yeah,
we didn't know. Yeah,

1187
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:29,140
it's so bad.
Scumbags.

1188
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:31,830
Total scumbags gum bag.
Well,

1189
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:36,290
I'm glad I had vocal fry on
their fucking thing. Comedy time.

1190
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:40,490
Douche bags. Um, thanks guys.

1191
01:17:40,491 --> 01:17:45,491
Thanks for scouring the
Internet and finding shit 20
years ago and road rules or

1192
01:17:46,191 --> 01:17:48,810
10 years ago.
This here is a a,

1193
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:53,860
it looks like this lady seems to have
accidentally taken the wrong drink at

1194
01:17:55,281 --> 01:17:58,010
Starbucks. In other
words, they put something,

1195
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,520
I think she took the wrong one
and she's fucking loses her mind.

1196
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:02,500
Oh yeah.

1197
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:07,500
[inaudible] they're like
fucking white people.

1198
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:20,630
She's having a panic attack. White people
are the worst. That's another touch.

1199
01:18:20,631 --> 01:18:23,910
Assholes to great title for an uh,

1200
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:27,420
a special to white people are
the worst. Writing it down. Yeah.

1201
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:30,860
It's a really good title.
You got it.

1202
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:36,920
[inaudible]

1203
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:43,270
Holy Shit. She's mentally ill. So
do you understand? I understand.

1204
01:18:43,271 --> 01:18:45,010
I think it would happen now.
She said,

1205
01:18:45,011 --> 01:18:47,620
you said that the next thing
we're going to be mine. So,

1206
01:18:47,621 --> 01:18:48,900
and then there's a second round,
the third round.

1207
01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:53,150
So they keep saying like your
thanks coming your drink. She's

1208
01:18:56,440 --> 01:19:00,160
laughing. Like look at his psycho.
Worried about a fucking drink.

1209
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:01,883
Starbucks

1210
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:07,210
personal [inaudible]

1211
01:19:12,030 --> 01:19:15,870
and that Starbucks employee you've got
to give credit was like really patient,

1212
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:19,280
really understanding great company.
Yeah.

1213
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:21,630
Because part of you wants to go like,
Hey,

1214
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:27,230
are you fucking serious right now that
you're freaking out that I said your

1215
01:19:27,511 --> 01:19:29,550
drink was next and it's not.
You see these cups,

1216
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:33,070
yours is one of these chill the fuck out.
Ain't no,

1217
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:36,430
it's called and she just takes a,

1218
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:40,590
she's just take one of those hundred
and 60 degree cups and just knowing that

1219
01:19:40,591 --> 01:19:45,060
Lady's face that was your drink. The
Fuck Outta here with that shit. Yeah.

1220
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:49,350
Well she's got other problems as you
can tell by the outfit and you like this

1221
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:53,010
type of behavior is tolerable and
about seven countries in the world and

1222
01:19:53,011 --> 01:19:54,150
everywhere else.
Oh,

1223
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:59,660
somebody just sticks a straw in your
neck just like drink out of that bitch.

1224
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:01,470
Well yeah.

1225
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:05,130
Could you imagine doing this and like
in Guatemala where the sinkhole have,

1226
01:20:05,131 --> 01:20:08,100
they'd be like, what? Why
are you, you're retarded.

1227
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:12,810
Throw you on the street there yet
addressed you. Yeah. Crazy person.

1228
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:15,260
Someone would beat you and
no one would stop it. No.

1229
01:20:15,570 --> 01:20:17,700
And then when the police came,

1230
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:20,860
so it be like that bitch was
going crazy about her shrink.

1231
01:20:20,861 --> 01:20:23,230
So I kicked her and they'd
be like, okay, good. Yeah,

1232
01:20:23,310 --> 01:20:25,590
cause I don't even
think in eastern Europe,

1233
01:20:25,591 --> 01:20:29,190
this shit would never held in Hungary
or Budapest if you didn't get your drink

1234
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:32,670
right. They'd be like, fuck you,
get outta here. Oh, okay. Yeah.

1235
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:36,360
There's no such thing as
the customer being right in
other countries, by the way,

1236
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:37,740
that is what the problem is,

1237
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:41,250
is that the customer is always
right and that is a lousy mantra.

1238
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:44,130
So stupid monkey.
They're not always right dude.

1239
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:45,780
And if you've worked in customer service,

1240
01:20:45,810 --> 01:20:50,100
you fucking know that there's a lot of
crazy people out there too. Crazy. Really?

1241
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:51,450
That's what's going on here.

1242
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:53,093
Customers not right.

1243
01:20:58,100 --> 01:20:59,320
She's definitely crazy.
Then

1244
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:05,060
now she's gonna fuck an email list this
week I saw that I was on your podcast

1245
01:21:05,061 --> 01:21:08,410
and I was very excited
and we look bad.

1246
01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:13,690
[inaudible]

1247
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:35,550
can I tell you something like,
honestly,

1248
01:21:35,551 --> 01:21:39,640
deep down when that happens to me,
I panicked a little too.

1249
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:44,020
Once my drink coming, like when
we see other people getting there.

1250
01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:45,790
Before you and you know you
were here before though.

1251
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:49,820
It's definitely something you recognized
and a feeling, but reacting like that.

1252
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:54,070
So you don't, I don't let it out, but
I have it. I do have it, nick about it.

1253
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:57,270
And you're like, but that's what you do
is your eyes are like, and then you go,

1254
01:21:57,271 --> 01:22:00,960
art is mine.
Is there one there for Christina?

1255
01:22:03,510 --> 01:22:06,410
And then they go, what is yours? You're
like, it's, it's, I think it's that cup.

1256
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:11,140
Oh yeah, we'll be there in a minute. Okay.

1257
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:17,590
You don't do that because that's too far.

1258
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:21,700
But that was a child temper
tantrum. You know, children react.

1259
01:22:26,050 --> 01:22:28,060
That's how I see.
Or I feel that way 100%.

1260
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:33,320
Right. But then as an adult you go, oh,
that's not appropriate. Yeah, you can't,

1261
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,020
you can't react that dead face.

1262
01:22:38,490 --> 01:22:42,340
It's so great. You thought that was yours
and now you're fucking flipping out.

1263
01:22:43,450 --> 01:22:45,580
Crazy white lady.
Crazy white lady.

1264
01:22:45,650 --> 01:22:48,550
That is crazy white lady
named crazy white lady.

1265
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:55,570
I like crazy white lady. That's
pretty funny actually. Um, oh,

1266
01:22:55,810 --> 01:22:59,230
I guess I would play a crazy
white ladies good before we leave,

1267
01:22:59,390 --> 01:23:01,450
but I need to have a joke
about it. Yeah, I know.

1268
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:05,470
You can't just have you fill your
mind with different idea, you know,

1269
01:23:05,471 --> 01:23:08,440
and then figuring out crazy white lady.
White people are the worst.

1270
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:12,100
Why did people are terrible? They
really are. The reason everything sucks.

1271
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:13,340
It's so true.
We,

1272
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:17,140
we tried to culturally a
dominate everybody else.

1273
01:23:17,141 --> 01:23:21,400
We think we're the best. Yeah,
we, yeah, we're just douche bags.

1274
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:22,540
We've ruined the world.

1275
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:27,640
Absolutely. Hey Mommy,

Hey, can I ask you something?
Would you ever date your mom?

1324
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:54,110
You date your mom? I mean,
it's just like the gays.

1325
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:01,120
It's just like, it's just like some
crazy people out there for that.

1326
01:27:03,110 --> 01:27:06,790
Yeah. You mean as well? They
didn't know. They were like,

1327
01:27:07,090 --> 01:27:11,590
they were in love with
someone like, no, no,

1328
01:27:11,591 --> 01:27:15,590
I'm talking about Dave,
your mother, you can't,

1329
01:27:15,990 --> 01:27:19,810
so they said no, I would
not date him. I'm like,

1330
01:27:21,390 --> 01:27:26,260
don't, no, I wouldn't answer.
Then I would say no. You say no.

1331
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:30,220
Yeah. Okay. All bars. All right.
I'll mark you down as a note.

1332
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:36,510
I mean people worth to you
that nurtured you in her womb.

1333
01:27:36,911 --> 01:27:40,840
Once you come out of that, there should be
no going back. Yeah. You don't go. Yeah,

1334
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:45,400
I stayed the same. I do. I'm a

1335
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:48,830
crazy browns.

1336
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:57,740
Oh Wow. She threw in a thanks.
Hitler, Rachel and Shawn.

1337
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:02,010
Wow. You ran into what? What people
are not used to running into,

1338
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:06,210
which is somebody engaging a person. Yeah.
It's set up somewhere being like, no,

1339
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:09,380
yeah, no, I wouldn't. Whatever. He was
like, wait, what? It was like, yeah,

1340
01:28:09,470 --> 01:28:12,750
really thoughtful, articulate guy who
was like, what are you saying? Yeah.

1341
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:16,380
What are you saying? What? How was
it like the gays? Yeah, exactly.

1342
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:18,810
That guy didn't throw that away.
He was like,

1343
01:28:19,140 --> 01:28:22,380
that is a dumb thing that
you could possibly say

1344
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:27,120
because it is. It is. It
is. It is the decoy. Yeah.

1345
01:28:27,121 --> 01:28:31,350
I mean that's why that's the dumb, it's
the dumbest comparison. So that guy goes,

1346
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:32,453
how is that?

1347
01:28:32,910 --> 01:28:36,770
Which is exactly what you should think
when somebody says it's like the gates,

1348
01:28:37,410 --> 01:28:41,700
but I love how she really plays it off
and she was like, it's just, it is wrong.

1349
01:28:41,701 --> 01:28:46,110
It's what some people say. Like he
really was like, oh, it's old herself.

1350
01:28:46,410 --> 01:28:49,340
Like asking the question. In other
words. Yeah. She made it seem like it's,

1351
01:28:49,410 --> 01:28:52,620
it's a worthwhile, but she's like, we're,
they're saying there. It's a debate.

1352
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:55,770
It's a debate.
I'm going to mark you down as a no,

1353
01:28:56,970 --> 01:29:01,040

01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:29,730
Either he's touched or he's on drugs,

1388
01:31:30,550 --> 01:31:33,150
he's tweaking ensemble and he doesn't
know what the fuck he's doing.

1389
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:34,750
You didn't never crawl under us.

1390
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:53,950
What are you good

1391
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:01,293
boy?

1392
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:09,610
Can't believe how much this kid kept
it together. That's taken a shift.

1393
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:14,480
I think 98% of the population would
not be able to view it this way.

1394
01:32:14,510 --> 01:32:16,840
I know I would. I'd be
like, Dude, I'm shitting

1395
01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:23,260
rob or shooting the
shit. Dude, I'm shitting

1396
01:32:26,050 --> 01:32:29,320
shitting your terms. Ron. Ron,

1397
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,320
what are you doing? Hey, wake up.

1398
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:48,250
Wake up thinking
about

1399
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:54,940
blowing up.
Shit.

1400
01:32:58,010 --> 01:32:58,843
It's Kinda,

1401
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:07,710
it's Kinda
scary because at the end,

1402
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:11,510
the guy that's Charles
really close to the team

1403
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:14,113
that way

1404
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:18,540
and had abrupt stops.
