1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:05,290
Well. Well, well go to your mom's house,

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,383
Christina.

3
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,100
Your mom's house is supported
in part by the song.

4
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,370
There you go. All right. Sorry.

5
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,700
The bandwidth anymore.
My brain,

6
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,000
something happens when you pump
a child out of your vagina.

7
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,460
It's your mind. Okay. This
is a cheese keeps cubes.

8
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,683
The song is

9
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,980
Cadillac. Oh, I like it. It's by ob one.

10
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,620
Of course there'll be one canola.
Um,

11
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,600
very talented. He is very talented.
Very talented Hawaiian. Yeah.

12
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,830
I remember when we went there
and everyone said it like that.

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,930
E I'm going to breath
bomb beach this weekend.

14
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,780
Tickets are moving real well.

15
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:16,781
So if you're in the breast bomb area right
down the street from mar a lago where

16
00:01:17,481 --> 00:01:21,560
our president elect chills
sometimes, um, come see me.

17
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,150
I'm only doing four shows.
Make America great again.
Maybe Gary. Good, great. Again,

18
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:30,620
come see me at the Improv in
West Palm beach this weekend. Um,

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,810
right after that I'm a home for awhile
doing some la shows, the genes machine.

20
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:39,650
Christine's, uh, we'll be
at the Washington Dick Hum.

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,040
Improv in the nation's capital
where then you are kind,

22
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,880
Kinda Camacho will be
running the country soon.

23
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:50,600
I think five people voted for
him in that state. In what state?

24
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,160
In Washington district of Columbia and
District of Columbia. Yeah. The state.

25
00:01:55,161 --> 00:01:59,510
You just lost all your
points. A kids. It's in,

26
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,310
there you go. You're doing the one of
the best clubs in the country. Yeah.

27
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,170
December 9th and 10th. It's really great.
I know. I can't wait. I can't wait.

28
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:12,320
I I knew at one point what stayed
out. That was it. Yeah. All right.

29
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,150
It's not a state babe. It's still
not a static. I know. It's a major,

30
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,890
uh, small city. There
you go. Um, New Year's.

31
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,130
I'm in Orlando,
Florida at that Improv.

32
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,800
And then my big tour starts in January.

33
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,090
We've added shows in Minneapolis,

34
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,730
Chicago, Portland, um,

35
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,900
Boston. Those are, those cities have
added shows. Other cities we're probably,

36
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:44,030
you know, not going to
add in. Get your tickets.

37
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:47,960
Now I start off in Kansas City
at the beginning of the year. Um,

38
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,980
I head Oxnard and then it is
on. Man. I, I'm doing some,

39
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,480
I'm doing a new New Orleans clear water.
It's going to be nuts.

40
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,920
It's going to be really quick. Were you
hear Ochsner? Don't you think of ox balls?

41
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,970
Yeah, I do. I've planned a
whole life. Cox nars. Yeah.

42
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,980
I've never said it out loud until now.
I'm really excited for this.

43
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,870
What do you think? Yeah, we added um,
Calgary, Edmonton and this Friday.

44
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,870
So in a couple of days the Vancouver
goes on sale. Just want it to look.

45
00:03:15,871 --> 00:03:16,391
Put that out there.

46
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:19,690
Do you think Trump's first order of
business will be to move the state,

47
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,490
the country's capital to like Miami?
That'd be awesome. Somewhere more fun.

48
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,030
I don't think he would.
He's a swimmer.

49
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,440
He doesn't know what Miami vibe somewhere
where there's more hot chicks. Yeah.

50
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,530
It's still fucking hot chicks around here.

51
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,190
You guys are all serious talking
about likes and he likes,

52
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,340
he does like some hot chicks,
but who can blame them for that?

53
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,610
It isn't like those bummer chicks.
Thank stuff. How opinions, boom.

54
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,770
Boom. You're ready to start the
show. Oh my God. I'm so ready to,

55
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,540
let's go jean

56
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,020
the honorable member or for a
Senate Gulf islands. You're rough,

57
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,560
my friend and her speech,

58
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:02,100
but I heard her to say a word that I
know is distinctly on parliamentary and I

59
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:05,640
think she may want to withdraw it.
The word was f a r t,

60
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:13,330
z. Honorable men, uh, member
for Calgary Signal Hill. Are
we saying, are you serious,

61
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:15,670
Mr Speaker? Like is my
colleague actually, seriously,

62
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,110
I just gave an impassioned speech
that's about supporting Alberta jobs and

63
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:23,650
that's what the leader of a political
party stands up and has to say. No,

64
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:24,484
I don't withdraw it.

65
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,520
Oh, it's Ryan. Don't bring
anyone loving to this.

66
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,510
Well, well, go to your mom's house,

67
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,300
Christina.
It's interesting.

68
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:53,270
Feel the base. That's a good one. Oh Wow.

69
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,180
Okay.

70
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,980
The sound is so immense.
My, my ear candy rumbling,

71
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:30,340
those, you know, I got those for you.
That's a gift. I got you. These are no,

72
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,960
not recently, but yeah, a while
ago, right? You just said no.

73
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,650
I thought you meant you just got these
from. No, but that was a present.

74
00:05:36,651 --> 00:05:37,700
Like I love these.

75
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,870
These are what I used to wear on airplanes
when I traveled a lot so I could lock

76
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:45,650
out other people. Yeah, you just
seal out the rest of the world.

77
00:05:45,651 --> 00:05:49,730
You're a huge fan of noise cancelling
head. I haven't got the mini ones.

78
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,590
The inner ear noise. Canceler
yeah, they're awesome. Does
that work? Okay, fantastic.

79
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:57,980
Put it in your rectum.
Yeah. And then your,

80
00:05:57,981 --> 00:06:01,250
your butthole closes and you can't
hear anything. It's fantastic.

81
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,120
All right. You know what I wish is that
people in our country, I talk back like,

82
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,170
oh my God. Like why is no one talking
to a president elect Trump this way?

83
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:16,760
Like are we fucking serious
while he gives us state of the union?

84
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,670
You're orange.
Nobody's making any sense.

85
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,860
This is great. This just goes to
show how sensible Canadians are

86
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,500
by the way, were, were in the studio.
We made it. It's still a mess.

87
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,780
We made it though.
This is better than last week.

88
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:38,450
So you can actually see a little
bit better than it used to me.

89
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,320
You can see we have an actual
production desk. Look at this.

90
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,870
This is like your, um, your
Dj Dad Mouth Central Station.

91
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,180
I got my turntables
right over there tables.

92
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,710
We got special soundproofing on
these walls and on the ceilings.

93
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,310
I missed him too. I'm glad you
brought him back into the fold. Yeah,

94
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,030
that's the American. And then
this is Canadian. So that's our,

95
00:07:15,031 --> 00:07:18,280
our Congress. It's how
we talk. We talk funny,

96
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,540
I just gave an impassioned
speech and then we go and then

97
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,813
a,

98
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,420
this was amazing. This
is a, this is incredible.

99
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,910
She said f a r t

100
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,520
talking about how to retain skilled labor.
Thank you.

101
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,770
Why isn't the infrastructure minister
talking about how to implement

102
00:07:40,771 --> 00:07:44,010
infrastructure funds and get
construction workers to work in Alberta?

103
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,510
Why does this government treat
Alberta like a fart in the room?

104
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,470
Nobody wants to talk about or acknowledge.

105
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,890
I like that is where my constituents had
been out with this government for over

106
00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:00,000
a year. And you know what? We're tired
of it. Oh. And by the way, constituents,

107
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,380
as I'm giving this speech,

108
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,980
there's liberal members across the aisle
that are laughing at me and they're

109
00:08:04,981 --> 00:08:05,910
laughing at you.

110
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,970
Okay, Ooh, I like her. Can
we get her to work down here?

111
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,400
Fan of the honorable member.

112
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,190
I'd like to use me,
my friend in her speech,

113
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:24,730
but I heard her to say a word that I
know is distinctly on parliamentary and I

114
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:28,190
think she may want to withdraw it.
The word was f a r tape.

115
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,960
The honorable men. Hey Oliver.
He signals are you serious?

116
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:40,370
Are you serious? Are
tape, whatever it was. F,

117
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,411
F, a, r.

118
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:47,090
T. F. A. R. T. A.

119
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,720
You know who that is? That's the
tattle tail tree school teacher.

120
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,693
Teachers.
Yeah.

121
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:00,610
Yeah.

122
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:05,440
Elizabeth, you fucking tattle tale
nurse. Such a fucking nerd. Nerd alert.

123
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,210
He said, what's going to happen? Are
they gonna punish her for saying that?

124
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:17,020
I have a lot to say about the
content of my friend speech.

125
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:22,330
I am deeply concerned as are all people
in this place for Canadians who are

126
00:09:22,331 --> 00:09:24,270
hurting economic downturn,

127
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,680
but the first important,
excuse me.

128
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,690
Oh good. Well just sit down.
Maybe she has to follow it.

129
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,230
Maybe she had to fart right then.
I wonder how often she farts.

130
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:41,900
She looks like she can,
she can. She farts a lot,

131
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,020
but it looks like they just
like kind of like fallout.

132
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,750
I think she eats a lot of TV dinners in
front of the television and she farts

133
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,890
and she pets her cats.

134
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,900
Yeah. Oh, oh, oh, oh.

135
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,523
What's going on?

136
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,000
Yeah.

137
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,540
And we're back. So this is part
of a living in a new place.

138
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:09,460
We've had a constant stream of
workers work things. Nothing.

139
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,300
Nothing really works. When you first
buy a house, Internet's terrible.

140
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:18,130
Internet blows the heater's not working.
Uh, the pool needs where it's all,

141
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:22,360
it's all under construction, but it's
coming together guys. Yup. Our life,

142
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,660
our life is almost gotten.
They uh,

143
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,020
they just shamed this lady
and just sitting down.

144
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,900
The lady who was like far T, well
they should, you know, like I said,

145
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:37,000
we could use a little bit of this and our,

146
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:41,440
and our politics from the no fun patrol,
you know. Fine. So what if someone,

147
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,070
she said Fart in the wind.
It was in the context of an event.

148
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,970
She's The lady that when she was a kid
and the teacher left the room for a

149
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:52,710
second, she told the
teacher came back, she said,

150
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:58,180
who said that everybody could have one
cookie and Simon had for Robbie had four

151
00:10:58,181 --> 00:11:01,390
cookies. Yeah. Fuck yeah. This,

152
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:04,480
this is the syndrome of someone
who needs justice all the time.

153
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,210
Not about justice at that point.
They know dickhead.

154
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,830
This is speaker.
Uh,

155
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:14,950
the leader of the Green party has been
probably one of the most vocal opponents

156
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,840
of every part of the Alberta economy.

157
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,610
So I will take no lessons
from her on Oh shit.

158
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,740
Alberta Bitch

159
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,270
for the set of shut Gulf islands.

160
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,580
And I feel it's important
to make something of the
member's choice of words is

161
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:39,581
that she then accused people opposite
her for reacting at in that context,

162
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,150
decorum is important and respect
is important to this place.

163
00:11:44,151 --> 00:11:48,530
I remind those who are now heckling me
that you are breaking the rules when you

164
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:52,820
do so. I've never heckled
in this place. Not once.

165
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,650
And I've never used language that
was on parliamentary, not once.

166
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:59,440
And I recognize my friends passion,
but I do not.

167
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,420
Stephanie's, she just sat down
again. Yeah. She got fucking shot.

168
00:12:05,421 --> 00:12:08,140
Hold. What's up? You know as a r t

169
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,010
I love that. I could hear her say
that. Oh well she didn't even,

170
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,900
she didn't tell her. She didn't
say the word. She spelled it out,

171
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:24,430
which is extra juvenile to me when adult
can't repeat a bad word. Of course.

172
00:12:24,431 --> 00:12:27,100
That makes me crazy.
Just say far dummy.

173
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,830
Like you've never said
Fart in your private life.

174
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,530
She didn't want to sink that low.

175
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,460
Shouldn't listen to this
show. I'm like, oh my God.

176
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,780
Elizabeth would have a real problem.
This, this show should be like,

177
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:45,770
it was the most offensive,
most offensive. Far. Yay.

178
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:52,520
Four. Yeah, four,

179
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,940
four. I remember she was from last
week, the big, the big flip fluff.

180
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,920
Ms Fluff. Great. Big forever. She is.
Yeah. She was so fucking fat. Oh my God.

181
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:08,110
Yeah. That was way fat. Cause
bird is fat. But that was like,

182
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:12,010
oh, obese. Oh yeah. That
was easily to Burt's today,

183
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,790
which has enormous, yeah. You
know what I'm saying? Yeah.

184
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,650
So yeah, so big. Speaking of that, I mean,

185
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:23,470
I'm really hitting this, this weight loss
thing hard. You're really, first of all,

186
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:25,210
you're really hitting your drops today.
I got to say,

187
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:26,830
you're on point with your drops.
Thank you.

188
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,830
And you've been hitting the weight
loss game harder than I've ever seen.

189
00:13:29,831 --> 00:13:34,810
You hit it. He's serious. Mr
Speaker, like you have been, well,

190
00:13:34,811 --> 00:13:37,730
first of all, working out daily. Yeah.

191
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,670
Jammin on the one the diets clean as
fuck right now. You bought the, uh,

192
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,120
that tank that you sit in for an hour
a day. Sweat the sweat tank. Yeah.

193
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,910
So you're losing water weight in addition
to fat. So there's a lot going on.

194
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,550
Yeah, it's pretty great. It's
pretty great. I mean, it's a,

195
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:59,440
it's a full on challenge
at this point about who is,

196
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:03,690
you know, who's going to be less of a pig,
right. Beginning of the new year. Well,

197
00:14:03,691 --> 00:14:08,020
and I've seen Burt's propaganda on
Instagram. Yeah. I don't buy it.

198
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,530
I don't think he's doing anything.
Yeah. You, you shouldn't buy it. I mean,

199
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,760
now it's nonsense. He's a
big liar. You know, he, um,

200
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,990
I see him telling nothing but
lies all the time and he's, uh,

201
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,600
he's also somebody who you
have to remember. Oh, this
is him right now shut. Oh,

202
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:27,520
okay. Burnt Chrysler. Hey,

203
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,390
sure. Clean it up. No, no.

204
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:38,350
Rock tweeted us in a ticket. 10. Friedberg

205
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,690
oh, what'd he say? Uh, no.

206
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,270
Okay.
Watch my news video and then call me back.

207
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,280
Well, um, we're doing a podcast
right now. Oh, son of a bitch.

208
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,300
What do you, what is your new,
just tell us. Just tell us.

209
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,760
I ended up dealing with you today.
I'm running on the treadmill after I did

210
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,310
my line was I call these
two bearings for those.

211
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,030
Y'All didn't get posted
back in high school.

212
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:16,270
That's where I was real men put hair on
the balls and the rock just back in high

213
00:15:17,011 --> 00:15:18,410
school line.
Happy Rolling.

214
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,720
That's hilarious man.

215
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I watched the video
and then, and then call me later.

216
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,720
Where's the video?
Is it on your Twitter?

217
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,450
It's on everywhere. It's
on Twitter. On Instagram.

218
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:34,130
It's a video a day during this
weight loss challenge. And, uh, and,

219
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,620
and just instead of doing a blog,
post them on Instagram.

220
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,520
Oh, another thing I want to
talk, I was talking to Ari,

221
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:43,510
he was saying that like we're just doing
a straight up weight loss challenge.

222
00:15:43,511 --> 00:15:45,100
That's how I understood it.
Right. He was like, well,

223
00:15:45,101 --> 00:15:49,630
if he's a half inch taller than you,
then he doesn't have to leave. I'm like,

224
00:15:49,631 --> 00:15:52,300
no dude, I'm not playing that. We're
doing a straight up challenge. Yeah.

225
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,050
Here's the deal. Here's the
deal. We both measure. Okay.

226
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,520
Okay.
We both come in at six one

227
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,280
and the whole deal is we just,

228
00:16:03,281 --> 00:16:08,281
all we have to get really is the pure 27
but we can get below 27 you have to pay

229
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:09,214
for the trip.

230
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,440
Both of you. Does he understand
that that's on him? If we hit that,

231
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,760
yes.
You get totally gets it.

232
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,900
Just simply overweight and not

233
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,210
our number is two 27

234
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,600
okay. Okay, so 27 all right.

235
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:36,030
Yeah,
she did a fear.

236
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,160
Okay. Okay, so that's this.
That's the addition to thing.

237
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,070
That's the on that

238
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:48,420
a den Denim you mean? All
right, so I'll look up.

239
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,730
I'll look up this video you just posted.

240
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:53,830
Call me later.

241
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:57,310
All right. All right, sounds
good. Bye. I didn't know that.

242
00:16:57,311 --> 00:17:01,930
So you guys only have to get to
being overweight and not obese.

243
00:17:01,931 --> 00:17:06,430
So two 27 and above is considered
obese. Well, for our height,

244
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:10,720
I mean, yeah, so two days right now we're,

245
00:17:10,721 --> 00:17:15,310
we're grotesquely obese and if we get
done at two 27 we'll just be overweight.

246
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:21,070
Like if we want it to be healthy.
But also you should,

247
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:25,590
you should remember this though.
The BMI is a super outdated measuring.

248
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,000
No, it really is. It really is.

249
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,110
How so explain to me how
the BMI like takes into,

250
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:35,650
it doesn't take into it like it wasn't
taking into account like at your muscle

251
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:38,890
mass. Really. It's just saying
like based on an average size guy,

252
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:43,490
oh you should weigh this amount, but you
could, you could be a muscular guy and,

253
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,970
and could be considered obese by it.

254
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:50,220
You could also just be kind of
a normal build guy and still

255
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,100
be considered obese by it. Cause
it's, it's an outdated measurement.

256
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,600
It's just taking the number is
what you're saying. But yeah, it's,

257
00:17:56,601 --> 00:17:59,910
it's just saying, oh, you're six feet
tall, you shade weigh 180 pounds,

258
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,710
but you can see guys that are two 10 that
are healthy guys. They're like, no, no,

259
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,510
you're obese now. Cause you're, you're,

260
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:10,550
so you're saying instead they should do
a ratio of your body fat to muscle tone?

261
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,590
Well, I'm saying that if somebody were
to really want to find out on this scale,

262
00:18:15,591 --> 00:18:19,920
you should do like a, a real, uh,
modern day body fat percentage.

263
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:22,140
So you know how much,
right, like a trainer,

264
00:18:22,141 --> 00:18:26,250
when you see sometimes they paint your
fat and then they tell you how fat you

265
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:31,140
are. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
Yeah. That's interesting.

266
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,490
I was like, Bro, I didn't find them. I
don't believe he's doing two a day. Oh,

267
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:38,680
I think it definitely just did you
think so? He did it today. Okay.

268
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,910
I'm not saying he's doing it every day.
Does he have a sweat tank like you have?

269
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,200
I don't think he has a sweat
tank. Um, you know, Diet.

270
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,740
I just can't see him sticking to it
for the month, especially on the road.

271
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,650
He's going to have so much
boost flowing through a system.

272
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,150
The problem with him and this challenge
is the road that's going to be a huge

273
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,170
obstacle for him.

274
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:02,640
And that's something thankfully you don't
have to contend with because he drinks

275
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:06,300
a lot. He drinks on the airplane,
don't forget, he doesn't fly sober.

276
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,770
So that alone is going to be quite
a challenge. Oh yeah. And it's,

277
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:15,330
it's a month of that, you know of
him trying to flush cannolis. Yeah,

278
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,740
I think so too.
It's impossible.

279
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,820
This is what's cool about this Internet
right now is that I can't fucking pull

280
00:19:20,821 --> 00:19:25,821
this up because the Internet here fucking
sucks even though we've paying for the

281
00:19:26,921 --> 00:19:30,550
top tier that they offer.
So that's always our problem.

282
00:19:30,551 --> 00:19:34,090
We always pay for the top tier and
we never get what we want. Dude,

283
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:37,840
it's such lush cause it's so hard to
get high speed internet and we've had

284
00:19:37,841 --> 00:19:42,460
different companies and they
all our garbage man dog shit.

285
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,503
Here we go.

286
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,620
Here we go in the morning, but
I'm ready to go to crossfit,

287
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,200
waiting for my workout partner,
Johnny Blade to come pick me up.

288
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:51,310
And that's how you start a day.

289
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,040
All before Tommy bonds just
had his first jar of honey.

290
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,120
Oh my hat fucked off.

291
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,580
Doesn't look good.
It doesn't look good at all.

292
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,270
No,
he's wearing a rock tee shirt.

293
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,823
Oh.

294
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:21,230
Oh my God. He looks like shit.
We are in jungle. Heading
back to the man cave. What?

295
00:20:21,231 --> 00:20:24,110
I call it two a day. For those of you
who didn't get pussy back in high school,

296
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,290
uh, two days with us. Bad ass used
to do to grow hair on her fault.

297
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,880
It's getting real up here.
Can you hear the music playing?

298
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:44,270
It's funny,
he goes funny.

299
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,540
He didn't do two a days cause he didn't
play ball. Well wasn't he like a,

300
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,430
what did he do in high school?
He would fucking hung out. Yeah.

301
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,080
He's one of these guys too that like,
oh my God. I remember one time I,

302
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,990
when I asked him, I go, did you play
football in high school? He goes, oh,

303
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,510
supposed to be like one of the
next best players at my school.

304
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:06,190
Like supposed to be great.
But then I injured my shoulder.

305
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,260
I was going to like everyone was talking
about how good I was going to be like

306
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:16,380
hypothetically, he was
proud of himself in college.

307
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:21,480
His movements are terrible in
college. Wasn't he van wilder? Yeah,

308
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,460
he was a lunatic. Partied.
He didn't even do the sports,

309
00:21:24,461 --> 00:21:26,680
so that looked really
bad when he was terrible.

310
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:31,420
It look like I got a 50 year old dude
trying to work out and you're like,

311
00:21:31,421 --> 00:21:34,010
stop it. You're going to pull
your back or something. Yeah.

312
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,400
He's gonna hurt himself.

313
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,500
I hope he got approval from his
position before he started. I should do,

314
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,950
I should do a video just where I show
him how to do this. This is bullshit.

315
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:50,680
He did once you've been doing
this already for months,

316
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,150
I'll take them to a class. Oh, remember
when you did crossfits? Oh my God.

317
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,790
He come home and you're like,
oh, it's a burpees. Burpees.

318
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,350
Yeah. I did a plank
yesterday, uh, two minutes.

319
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,390
First Time my entire life. Pretty
cool. You're just going to,

320
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,560
you're not going to give me any
kind of props. I am proud of you.

321
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,560
I think that's great.
I think I really do think that's great.

322
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm glad to 27 it's a magic number.
That's your record.

323
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:24,210
No booboo to 27. Oh, I thought
you meant to 27 was how long
you planned for? No. Oh,

324
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:29,140
just to two minutes. That's
fantastic. Yeah. Two 27 is not obese.

325
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:34,240
Okay. So No, you know, um,

326
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,410
yeah. Pretty incredible,
right? Very. Can't believe

327
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,210
I didn't do two a days and you throw it
to today's joke out. So fucking funny.

328
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,910
You know, bursts never even
been to Russia. No. That
whole story is just, it's,

329
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:52,300
it's all exactly. That's right.
Yeah. They didn't really call him no.

330
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,280
And he calls himself,
I'll stories guys.

331
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:59,920
It's all stories and his diet's
probably not clean. Oh my God.

332
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:04,540
He's not eating clean and not boozing
mean maybe for a few days. Maybe a week.

333
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:07,650
I could see him when he's
home. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

334
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:12,030
He's got leftovers because they blow it
out the crushers. Oh yeah. And there's,

335
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:16,590
I'm sure he's eating leftovers. It's
still sugar. We throw it out. We got,

336
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,430
we ate one day and then I throw it all out
the next day. Stuffing, green's paints,

337
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:25,910
tomatoes, tomatoes, checking,
Bam, Bam. Throw it out. Yeah.

338
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,450
So we didn't have,
we're not tempted to go to it.

339
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,680
That's how dedicated I am to my husband.
Winning the obesity challenge.

340
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,790
Challenge and not obesity challenge.
That's right. Two 27 jeans.

341
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:41,500
You're almost there getting closer.
Oh Dude, I'm getting closer.

342
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,590
Yeah. Written clean, clean
eating, clean living,

343
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,400
fitness, jumping rope, making boxing.

344
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:54,750
Boxing's I wanted to bring up a story.

345
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:59,780
We had the electrician come this week
and he pushed the doorbell and I answered

346
00:24:01,351 --> 00:24:05,340
and he goes, Oh hey jean. And
I had thought that I was heard

347
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:10,410
and I let him and I go,
I think he just called me gene.

348
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,460
And then later he goes, all
right Jeanne, you very much,

349
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,910
cause he heard me call you jeans
a few times and like jeans,

350
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,510
do you want this here? So he was like, he
was like, I'm picking up on it. You know.

351
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:25,340
He was like,
oh there's like Jane.

352
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:28,550
You loved it though.

353
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,400
Yeah.
I mean for a split second,

354
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,880
because we have had workers come through
here that are fans of your mom's house.

355
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,440
And I thought for a second,

356
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:40,310
maybe this guy is like a fan of the show
or something. Oh, for sure. He's a little,

357
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:42,740
he's a little older so I don't,
I didn't think so, you know,

358
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:47,120
but just the fact that someone called
me gene based on you is pretty great.

359
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:52,300
Pretty Great Jean ll the
morning gene flow gene. Um,

360
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:58,520
that was fun. It was fantastic. Jane Jane,

361
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:02,150
we still say jeans and mommy
to every drive through.

362
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,510
We do have the Starbucks drive through.
We live by a Starbucks now,

363
00:25:05,511 --> 00:25:10,160
so we drive through all the time and
it will be like a mommy, can I get a,

364
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:14,810
a Venti iced coffee, extra ice, no
sweetener. And they're like, okay,

365
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:17,240
it's going to be three 58. I'm
like, okay, thanks. Thanks jeans.

366
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,150
Say it fast. Yeah, because now I
do it. Yeah. And it's the most fun.

367
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,350
They never say anything.

368
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:30,150
And you can do it to waitresses were
Starbucks employees to anybody that you

369
00:25:30,151 --> 00:25:34,890
have an exchange with quick, quick, like
the grocery person, you go, hey mommy,

370
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,310
I'd like a blah, blah blah.
Thanks genes. I say things genes.

371
00:25:38,311 --> 00:25:39,850
Cause that one's easier.
Yeah.

372
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,400
I think we should start, um, uh,

373
00:25:44,401 --> 00:25:49,170
phenomenon around the world where
people start doing this. Hey Mommy,

374
00:25:49,171 --> 00:25:53,610
I like a double cheeseburger, blah, blah,
blah. Thanks jeans. Those, by the way,

375
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:58,920
those fucking international
Burdis fats are so fucking funny.

376
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,220
Aww.
I love that Indian one we got from the,

377
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,490
the female end major
Japanese wine was great.

378
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:12,030
So profesh so profesh profesh now there
was some controversy I noticed about

379
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:18,640
last week's master of accents.
I noticed that too.

380
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,360
It looks like your title
is being challenged.

381
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:26,540
Okay. Um, let me pull it up here.
Yeah. People were like, oh my gosh.

382
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:29,240
Her Vaccines, Huh? Okay. Pops.

383
00:26:29,241 --> 00:26:34,100
We've had a bit of a rest
time now for some training.

384
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:39,320
What's involved in, she would pop
place now I have to say we were,

385
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,390
you were saying something
about how dignified,

386
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:44,100
I remember you were talking
about dignified breads and then

387
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,460
when this club's up, I would say that
you actually said, oh, interesting.

388
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:51,240
First you're blaming, wait a minute,
I'm the apprentice of accents.

389
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:54,600
You're the master of eggs, but
you lived there. Yeah, I know,

390
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:57,630
but I was tired and not paying attention.
I'm just saying,

391
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,760
I think I followed your lead, but
you're the master. I'm just saying,

392
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:05,950
I think you polluted my mind for a moment.
Uh,

393
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,380
but then we had a number of people
write in a very upset saying this is

394
00:27:10,381 --> 00:27:14,850
absolutely very clearly not British.
It's Australian.

395
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,800
And then people on top of that wrote
in and go, this is Kiwi. Well yes,

396
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:20,161
you're right.

397
00:27:20,161 --> 00:27:23,590
Now allow me to clarify cause I read
all the emails and I've done my, uh,

398
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,510
my research here.

399
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:30,120
I heard the first speaker is Momster
alien and this key, this guy,

400
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,440
this New Zealand guy wrote and he's like,

401
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:35,250
I was so happy to hear that we're going
to shit on the ozzies cause I gives us

402
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:39,210
Kiwis. Great Joy. Yeah. And then he
goes, the rest were Kiwis. Oh really?

403
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:44,040
The first speaker is mom's trillion and
then all these lunatics so that the dog

404
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:49,041
wrangler is Australian and
then these little savage pigs,

405
00:27:49,661 --> 00:27:53,820
what's of his are Kiwi, right? These
suck pigs and they're laid texts.

406
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:57,340
Dog Fetish costumes are Kiwis. Wow. Right.

407
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,580
What a masterful right accent this
man has. Right. It's really weird.

408
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,110
Pops. We've had a bit of arrests, but it's

409
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,820
training.
What's involved in here?

410
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:13,630
Pop place at first seems really simple
because most people think you just get

411
00:28:13,631 --> 00:28:17,290
the most value. Right. Waddling
around and for the buck buck,

412
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,670
but it's really so much more complicated.
Oh my God.

413
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,540
Complicated than this. When do you
guys pull your dicks out? Yeah,

414
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,360
when he sent that he's Seiko that belongs
to somebody in the room. We'll dump up.

415
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:35,310
See, I knew it was mine. Well
done. Oh God. It's so fucking bugs.

416
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:38,950
Petting the puppy in the latex costume.

417
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:43,890
It's upsetting. It wasn't any other
trainers. There wasn't anyone to teach me.

418
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,450
You lived in Australia to Adam.
I know put together,

419
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:52,950
but I will say, can you press
pause? Yeah. Is that his accent?

420
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:57,160
His accent feels subtly Momster alien.
It's,

421
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:01,960
it doesn't sound as much as like
Gig you go day by. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

422
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:06,690
When they toggling tog o we have a big
Australia now I'm here. Yeah. Yeah.

423
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:11,210
One of the clips coming up.
That's right.

424
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,060
Pop lately.
Yeah.

425
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,500
How much for you to do pup play with this
guy in charge and just all these other

426
00:29:19,351 --> 00:29:23,400
guys and they all recognize you from
your Netflix specials. Even with my dog,

427
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:24,211
mass gone.
Well,

428
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:29,211
they cut your beard out of the mass
of people can recognize good die my FM

429
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:33,240
Netflix. Hey, you sure this guy? You know,

430
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:37,350
he pulls his dick out and just Mal Fox.
All these dogs, they don't mention that.

431
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,510
I know, but you know
that's coming. Of course.

432
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,630
Why else are people
wearing this tech shit?

433
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:46,540
Oh my God. He's smelling the other guy's
ass and aesthetics and SafeWork. Oh,

434
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:49,260
for fuck's sake. Putting
that altogether. I've become,

435
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:55,160
I become a trainer and I
own and backing it again.

436
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:59,710
Hey, who's your honor? I use
your own. No, that's right.

437
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,560
Yeah, I should have gotten
this. It's very disappointing.

438
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,540
It was a sad day in your mom's house.
Yeah,

439
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,900
I was going to be honest and I'm
going to be open about who I am.

440
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:16,010
That's who just said that this guy in
a full fucking ridiculous dog mask and

441
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:21,400
latex suit, dammit. And by the way, fate,
perfect smile, dog teeth. Perfect smile.

442
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,080
By the way, these late full body
latex dog costumes can't be cheap.

443
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:29,370
No, it's a real investment
of real investment team.

444
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:33,160
Also investment of your time to live at
this fucking perverts house in his cage

445
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:39,310
to get the realistic dog face
costume with your eyes cut out.

446
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,680
I guess a really aggressive like,
you know,

447
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:46,060
costumes and masks can go one way and
yet that's a really aggressive looking.

448
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:50,650
Doesn't it look super aggressive? Of
course. Yeah. But that's his puppy nature.

449
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,360
That's his nature. He wants
to express Tom. Oh yes, sure.

450
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,750
So gross. I is so, it's so not my lane.

451
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,570
I'm just so, I'm so not into this stuff.
Yeah. Where'd it go though? I don't know.

452
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,181
Make Fun of them,

453
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:10,320
but I want to hear the difference between
the Kiwis and the mom's sterling. It.

454
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,010
Okay. Okay. Cause I'm not sure

455
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,190
and I'm going to be open about who I am,
about who I am.

456
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:20,070
I'm not ashamed of the fetish or
muffled of the people that you should be

457
00:31:20,071 --> 00:31:24,270
ashamed though. A little beautiful, very
ashamed. I'm not ashamed of the fetish.

458
00:31:24,271 --> 00:31:26,820
I'm not ashamed of.
Why not people that I hang out with.

459
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,620
I think you should be just a little bit,
I suppose that I want people tonight.

460
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:33,230
It's a normal community.
It's not,

461
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,810
I don't think that I
should be hiding it away.

462
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,700
You can read it 100% sure.
Just like the guy that Mary's,

463
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:44,590
there wasn't any other
trainers. It wasn't. Can you
want to hear that difference?

464
00:31:44,591 --> 00:31:48,160
Right? Yeah. Wasn't well, I can't
cause a muffled. It might get,

465
00:31:48,161 --> 00:31:52,090
it wasn't any other trainers,
Thales and tried anyone to teach me,

466
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:56,790
so I had to go out and learn and
put together. The idea is well done.

467
00:31:56,810 --> 00:32:00,310
Secret got a present for
me. Pretty boy. Good boy.

468
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,233
Yeah.

469
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:03,840
Yeah.

470
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,830
I took it off of a relief to get that off.
So now put it back on.

471
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,300
Your parents are watching

472
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:14,700
and I'm going to be open about who I
am that I'm not ashamed of the fetish.

473
00:32:14,701 --> 00:32:17,020
I'm not ashamed of the people that I have

474
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,860
and I suppose that I want people
can buy and normal community.

475
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,240
We live in this guy's cage hiding it away.

476
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:34,770
A relief to get that off. So what?
What the little relief to get that off.

477
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:38,700
Yeah. So Kiwi, I mean,

478
00:32:38,701 --> 00:32:43,370
I guess sounds a little more of the bling.
What are you doing?

479
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,750
No checking a message. Oh,
who's calling? I don't know.

480
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:50,630
I got somebody just left me a voicemail.
I don't know if it's a, Oh, okay.

481
00:32:50,631 --> 00:32:55,280
It's a different guy. Um, I don't
know if it was the guy in the house.

482
00:32:55,370 --> 00:33:00,020
Oh, I gave my number. Oh, it's the Harry
is he let letting you know. I mean,

483
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:04,010
he seems happy. He's fine.
He's very happy. You would
think for a sense of like,

484
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,000
Hey, I want to keep my day job. Yeah.

485
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:10,190
I don't need my friends and family to
know that I dress up like a latex dog and

486
00:33:10,191 --> 00:33:13,850
sniff other guy's butts and then
you know, yeah. F them. You don't,

487
00:33:13,851 --> 00:33:16,160
you don't need people to know.
Just like what we said last week.

488
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:20,630
Sometimes my trainer, he, he helps
me. You know your dog trainer? Yeah.

489
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,340
It's just like the
gays. Yeah. I asked him,

490
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:30,110
would you ever date your mom asked him,
would you ever date your mom? He was like,

491
00:33:30,111 --> 00:33:34,850
Yo, really word. He calls
me mom, you know? I mean,

492
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,800
you know what I mean? Yeah. So dumb.

493
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,440
So dumb.
Fuck him.

494
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,090
What's up man?
That's something else.

495
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,140
I wouldn't even open up that can of
worms. It's just like the gays. Yeah.

496
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:57,930
God. It's just like the game is still one
of the most alarming things we've ever,

497
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:00,680
in my opinion,
played ever need to buy.

498
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,580
It's one that lingered
around the house for days.

499
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:07,020
He kept quoting that one for
days. It's crazy. I asked,

500
00:34:07,021 --> 00:34:11,940
I'm your mom and you're my son and I
if falling in love with him. He said,

501
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,460
are you really? I said, yes, I
am. He's thinking, don't what?

502
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,480
I was scared to let you know too.
I am too bold consenting adults.

503
00:34:18,481 --> 00:34:23,430
If it comes down to it, you know, it's
just like the gays there, you know?

504
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:28,940
As long as they're over 18 everything's
fine. Yeah, yeah, Yup. Same thing.

505
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:34,190
Yup. Exactly the same. I
asked him, I asked him,

506
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:38,840
you day, your mom, how do
you like, that's such a,

507
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,340
she just brings it up.

508
00:34:40,341 --> 00:34:44,330
When they were just one day who are
talking and laughing and she was like,

509
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,920
I asked him, what would you ever
day your mom like? Yeah. Hello.

510
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:52,970
How are you responsible as a parent,
right? It's on her. It's on her.

511
00:34:52,971 --> 00:34:56,930
You're not supposed to, so you want to
hear a distinctly Australian accent? Yeah.

512
00:34:56,931 --> 00:35:00,110
Let's figure the difference out
between the Kiwi and the Australia.

513
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:04,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, it was always in
bed and we will have come and wake me up,

514
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,390
not coming into letting me Jaxa.
I'll say saying,

515
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,630
I'll make running towards the light.

516
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,870
He was up on the straight and then he
come back towards the car and I said,

517
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:15,900
Oh hey, what are you doing there? Am I
doing there, Mike? You got to wait here.

518
00:35:15,901 --> 00:35:19,770
And he's like, Nah, Nah. Oh. I fell asleep
behind the wheel and I'm like, what?

519
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,790
What ride I ride,
I,

520
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,210
he needs a perfect smile.
A devil.

521
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,850
He's missing some paper.
I don't know where a perfect smiles are.

522
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,710
I have a perfect smile on my travel case.

523
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,410
I traveled with it so that if I
ever need a smile on the road,

524
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,443
thank God.

525
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:42,510
Definitely. Then he just decided to start
walking up the street again and I said,

526
00:35:42,511 --> 00:35:43,230
what do you know,
Mike?

527
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,200
You got to wait to hear the cops in
common and he's just started taking off.

528
00:35:46,201 --> 00:35:47,300
So I was reading,

529
00:35:47,301 --> 00:35:51,210
so I jumped in me little purple car and
started chasing him up the street and

530
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:53,110
then he went down a solid straight,

531
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,100
told the cop as he went in the psyllid
straight and I went and got him.

532
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,070
This is awesome. No, it's
just tasting me jokes.

533
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,690
Should I see the memory jogger and
he's got four teeth? They know.

534
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:06,970
Don't Australians just sound adorable
no matter what they're saying. Yeah.

535
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:11,980
Even chopper chopper. Joe died
his pubes ginger JOPPA. I love it.

536
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,510
Yeah, they do. They're, they're, they're,
they're a fun group. Sweet. Right? Yeah.

537
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,480
He just don't sound like dicks.
I don't know how long you lived there.

538
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,700
Six months there.
I did road rules.

539
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:25,150
There were saying you lived there and
filmed for like almost three months,

540
00:36:25,151 --> 00:36:28,960
I think you lived there and nineties
I know, but you lived as well.

541
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,070
How does that make my point? Well,
no, I mean it was an extended trip.

542
00:36:33,071 --> 00:36:35,110
I don't know if I would
consider three months.

543
00:36:35,111 --> 00:36:37,360
You wouldn't say you lived there
for three months. All right.

544
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:42,100
Then I guess it's living, I mean I lived
in Boston for a summer, I still say yeah,

545
00:36:42,101 --> 00:36:45,790
but I lived in a, I lived in youth
hostels and a Winnebagos. Yeah.

546
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,730
In the winter you were doing challenges.
Shit man,

547
00:36:48,731 --> 00:36:50,440
you're wrestling crocs sitting on ice,

548
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:55,330
just glass and you're just
classical house. Glassing just glue.

549
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:02,290
I got a bad bite. I got a
bad, this guy looks so happy,

550
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:05,860
really happy. And you know
these Australians, they
always, they're always happy.

551
00:37:05,861 --> 00:37:06,091
I don't know.

552
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:09,730
I've never seen a bummed out Australian
and they were like that in the 90s

553
00:37:09,731 --> 00:37:13,330
everyone's super nice then it was a
90 thing. I don't know. I mean, look,

554
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:16,160
I just know that I didn't meet a
Root Ozzie when I was there. Really?

555
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,800
No Americans are Douche bag.
We're mean to foreigners especially,

556
00:37:20,801 --> 00:37:25,030
but there are so nice. I loved it
there. Canadians. Australians. Yeah.

557
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:30,420
K We. Oh, nice. They're
all nicer than us. Most.

558
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:34,800
Most other places. Would you say,
oh, this is, this is New Zealand.

559
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,660
Ah, shit man. Hey, this bundles of energy,

560
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:47,540
right? Snacks to keep them going.
That's why I moved my kids pretty bad.

561
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,703
Pretty bad.

562
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,800
No,
you're laughing at it because of this.

563
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,970
Preventing trips around your home
can be as easy as tidying up toys.

564
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:06,610
The breathing is, they're obviously
very close though. That's Kiwi. Kiwi.

565
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:09,550
It's a bit of, yeah.
Fruity fruity bars. Yeah.

566
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:14,020
It's stronger and I feel like a struggle
as a stronger accent he bought. Yes.

567
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,660
It's a little more fairy cutie

568
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,120
energy bundles.
Right?

569
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:27,110
Snacks to keep the snakes and that's
why I don't say x already. Buzz.

570
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:38,170
Oh my God. Do you know that I clean up
the toys now a lot more because of that.

571
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,970
Yeah. See if it worked then oh my
God. No, I don't want to see it again.

572
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,840
Fruity bars,
snacks,

573
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,770
snipped down right there.
No Way.

574
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:00,320
Do you ever seen a moose
coming down that quick?

575
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:05,080
We've been slipping along here.
Just glass with glass.

576
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,900
We're just glassing looks glass glass.

577
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:15,700
It makes me so happy. Oh man, that
makes me so happy. Ultimate Dad Boehner,

578
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,550
that guy.
Yeah,

579
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,510
like hearing our son laugh and this
guy made me happy no matter what. Yeah,

580
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,040
just glass and I like his dad.
Move Lenient Thompson Gore. Whoa.

581
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,930
This is the dad move.
Just glass. Yeah. Oh,

582
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,560
they do this like he was
really such a dad move. Yeah.

583
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:38,600
Got Out here. Look at
the metal. This is why.

584
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:44,060
This is why we came up here.
Been slap it along this big huge metal,

585
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:47,750
big long call meadow slipping along here.

586
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,770
Just glass and just glass
and glass and all of a sudden

587
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:56,630
put my head on. I'm like, oh, we're just
glassing. He's pick your two of those.

588
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,760
We know.
I was wrong that this guy's Canadian.

589
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:06,760
No. You thought it was going to. Of
course. Yeah. No, he's from Colorado.

590
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:10,930
I don't buy it. How do we have a
Canadian living in Colorado? Dude,

591
00:40:10,931 --> 00:40:15,460
he has no Canadian accent it and
looking for Moose. That's, I mean,

592
00:40:15,461 --> 00:40:19,670
there's nothing more Canadian than
that. No, no, you don't know. It's um,

593
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:24,160
it's really bad. How, how far off you
are with that one? You don't know.

594
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,210
I'm really, I'm really
disappointed. Yeah. Okay.

595
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:28,323
Okay.

596
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,880
First of all,
yeah.

597
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:39,520
I want to bring up something that
I'm really thankful for. You know,

598
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:43,890
we just celebrated thanksgiving,
thanksgiving giving mate.

599
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:47,020
That was a perfect English accent.
Thank you.

600
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,420
And we invited her friends over.
Yeah,

601
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:54,010
we did straight friends and straight
friends and no good friends. Nobody.

602
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:56,320
Non binaries. Yeah. And
I'm saying, wait, you know,

603
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:58,450
we didn't do anything we didn't
want to do. So the point is,

604
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,510
you and I made sweet love.
Oh yeah.

605
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:04,300
In our home for the first time here.

606
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:10,050
And I wanted to thank you because you
put on deodorant before we did it.

607
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:14,830
That's really and showered and I thought,
wow,

608
00:41:14,831 --> 00:41:19,360
what a special occasion. Yeah. Okay. So

609
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,400
you did, you said that and
I was like, what are you
talking about? How you go whoa,

610
00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:28,900
deodorant. What's, what's going on?
What's the, what's the big deal here?

611
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:33,610
Why, why the deodorant? Like I
weren't you on an every day? No.

612
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,270
Do you mean no?

613
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:39,200
I mean what I mean is usually
when you're asking for set Scx,

614
00:41:39,201 --> 00:41:42,020
I don't want to say the word STX you,

615
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:45,650
you don't usually grow them up
or do anything special for me.

616
00:41:45,651 --> 00:41:50,651
Right before sometimes you'll have
flown across the country tape the night

617
00:41:52,191 --> 00:41:54,290
before you'll have a show and
then you'll be like, can we do it?

618
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:59,330
I was really impressed that you took
the time to put on deodorant as well as

619
00:41:59,331 --> 00:42:03,830
shower prior to us doing it like right
then. That was really cool for me.

620
00:42:03,831 --> 00:42:08,831
The most memorable moment was
we did it Saturday and yeah,

621
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:16,050
it was at the tail end of the Florida,
Florida state kit

622
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,010
and I turned it off,

623
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:23,180
especially when as soon as I get over,

624
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:28,210
like as soon as I rolled over I go because
it was a game on that would to me it

625
00:42:28,531 --> 00:42:30,320
was like the special moment

626
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,970
that you turn the game off.
I thought,

627
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:37,760
I thought you just mute it while I
thought I would mute it and just watch.

628
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,340
But then you were like,
I could tell you weren't into that.

629
00:42:40,341 --> 00:42:42,230
So I turned it off and you know,

630
00:42:42,231 --> 00:42:47,230
I tried to get through it as fast as
I could for you. Um, and then yeah,

631
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:47,721
for me.

632
00:42:47,721 --> 00:42:51,950
And then when I rolled back over on me
like I wasn't game on and you were like,

633
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:56,320
okay,
I'm going to go to the shower for me now.

634
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:58,460
I thought that by the way,

635
00:42:58,461 --> 00:43:01,630
that's a sign of a real
marriage is when you get,

636
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,070
you can do it and then your husband goes,
can I put the gate back on?

637
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:08,250
And you'll go, yeah, fine. It's fine.
And there's no anger. Oh, right.

638
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:11,900
It means you're in a good place and your
mass truth because I know how important

639
00:43:11,901 --> 00:43:13,850
that game was to you. There's
Florida, Florida state,

640
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,640
and we won the gator
chomp killed the gators,

641
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:21,500
the gay turds turds. Ah,
that was really neat.

642
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:26,570
And we've been playing this a little
roleplay lately, which is fun.

643
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,640
Well because we were making kissy faces
the other day and in bed and you'd had a

644
00:43:31,641 --> 00:43:35,990
glass of wine. It was kind of like three
quarters done was the side of the bed.

645
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,520
When I went to kiss, you know, I was like,
oh, I like this. This is like back in my,

646
00:43:40,521 --> 00:43:41,870
uh,
bar.

647
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:46,730
My bar in the days when I used to just
kind of troll the bars and you go,

648
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,140
oh my God, really? I go, yeah, you
remind me of, uh, what's a good bar? Bar.

649
00:43:51,141 --> 00:43:54,770
Troll name Karen. Karen. Yeah. Total care.

650
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:58,040
Then you're Karen and
just make it the bar.

651
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,520
I want to do a smoke
a cigarette too as it,

652
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:04,190
because when you have that on your map,
then I know you're down a lose and smoke.

653
00:44:04,191 --> 00:44:07,520
I'm like, yeah, what's up? And
Karen has really low standards.

654
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:11,750
She's not used to being treated well.
That's the thing. Karen's like, Whoa,

655
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:15,830
you're kissing me. Usually I
don't get math. Pat My head.

656
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:18,290
And that's what's with all
these sheets on your bed

657
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,940
and Karen doesn't get mad when
the guy flips the game on. Right.

658
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:23,870
That's what she's cure.

659
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:26,630
Karen's actually used to have the game
on in the background as they're doing

660
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:27,464
full volume.

661
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:32,010
So Karen's thankful that you turn
it off and that's why I let you go

662
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,600
back to you would've been
what would've been cool.

663
00:44:33,601 --> 00:44:37,980
If you want to be like really cool.
Why points we do it in the dog face,

664
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:42,120
in the TV, all the Games
on. That could be cool.

665
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:46,580
This might be the guy that
let me check. Uh, who's that?

666
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,000
That's the guy in the house. Oh Shit.
There's a dude in our house. Oh,

667
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:55,280
there's so many dudes in our
house. Always. What the deal

668
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:00,900
is he is he calling? I
Dunno. He just said I'm done.

669
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:04,650
So I'll be asking me if I need to come
over there and not asking me. No. Okay.

670
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:10,470
We'll see what he says. Um,
glass. But anyways, and then
what I really liked. Yeah.

671
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,810
So you have been taking, you've
been smoking cigars lately. Outside.

672
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,710
I've been enjoying getting back into
cigars. I like them like, I don't know,

673
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:24,630
20 years ago and you were 10 and now
I like them more than 20 years ago.

674
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:29,940
You're only 37. Yeah. So like a teenager,
late teenage, what are you talking about?

675
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:33,960
That's what I like. Cigars,
Florida. That's when I got
into cigars in high school.

676
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:37,890
Yeah. Who the fuck? Smoke cigars and
high school. That's how I got into him.

677
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:42,160
I was doing two days. That's how it
fucking calm down. Calm down. Yeah.

678
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,180
That was a grown man
already. That is silly. Yeah.

679
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:49,950
So you came in after you smoke your
cigar and I kissed you and I was like,

680
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:54,270
well it looks like Karen found a
match. Yeah. You're Bobby. Bobby.

681
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:57,660
Bobby again. Cause I
had cigar breath. Right.

682
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:01,740
And Karen's got such low standards. A
Bobby can walk around and the shorts. Yes.

683
00:46:01,741 --> 00:46:06,500
Unfortunately. Oh, for crying out loud.
What's wrong with the heater? I Dunno. Uh,

684
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:11,110
I gotta go. I gotta go out there.
All right, pause, pause number two.

685
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,330
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Oh,

686
00:46:15,331 --> 00:46:20,250
I got to stay with the dogs
and back for interruptions.

687
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,560
There you go. High traffic today in
the Segura. Yeah, a lot going on.

688
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:31,710
Well, I got a little tree for you. You
want to hear it? I got a little treat.

689
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,560
No Robbie, here we go.
Hey Buddy. That's top dog.

690
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:42,450
Hey Buddy. Stop Dog. I was the
Georgia. Oh God. Hey Buddy.

691
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:47,640
Good job doc.
Do you need to wipe down?

692
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:53,350
Stop talk gave, uh, gave dad a call. Yeah.

693
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:59,150
Oh my gosh. Pretty fantastic conversation.
We haven't spoken with him in a while.

694
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,220
Yeah, it's been a while.
And I got lucky that, um,

695
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:04,500
not only did I get to talk to top dog,

696
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:08,670
I also got to talk a little bit too.

697
00:47:08,671 --> 00:47:12,570
Charro oh boy. So it was,
uh, it was something,

698
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:14,550
they're coming out pretty soon.

699
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:19,090
Hello? Hey Buddy. Hey, you're home.

700
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,810
Yeah, I'm home and work every
day. All Day. Some of them.

701
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:29,020
Oh, it's great. What, how's it going? What
are you doing watching Perry Mason with?

702
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:30,000
Oh,

703
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,070
cool.
Hey,

704
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:36,340
did you tell me the other day that
you had like a new fart smell?

705
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:42,880
I did. I did. I did. What, so
what do you attribute that to?

706
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:47,790
You know, I don't know. I don't know. I,

707
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:52,791
I think maybe a combination of
some different foods and things.

708
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:57,130
Uh, but, you know, I, I kinda have my,

709
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:02,170
my fart smells down to bed,
eight or 10 basic smells. Yeah.

710
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:06,980
And this was a new one and
it, it, you know, cause it,

711
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:11,320
and it was ugly, I have to tell
you, but it wasn't so ugly,

712
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:14,290
but it was just different. It, you know,

713
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:17,230
it was almost like it was somebody
else's heart. Were you surprised?

714
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,190
I was surprised. I was
totally surprised. Yeah. Yeah.

715
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:24,920
Yeah. And then, so what, what did it
lead to though? I mean like, was it a,

716
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,160
were you sick or

717
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:32,160
do you think now, now there wasn't, there
wasn't any, any event. Usually, you know,

718
00:48:32,161 --> 00:48:35,610
if you have some need, it's a
restaurant you've never eaten before.

719
00:48:35,611 --> 00:48:37,670
You go to somebody's house,
you know,

720
00:48:37,671 --> 00:48:41,640
I have some greasy Italian
food or something and yeah,
I guess, yeah, but this was,

721
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,320
this was,
uh,

722
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,770
crazy Italian or something like that.

723
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:49,130
Some guys in like Italian
hates a time for this.

724
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:51,160
The only person alive
that hates Italian thing.

725
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,920
Hates means I really, you know, I tried,

726
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,810
I went back and tried to remember
what I ate and I can't put,

727
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:00,550
but it was definitely different. You
know, it was a real job, a real discovery.

728
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:02,800
That's really something,
Huh?

729
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:05,700
It is. It is. You know,

730
00:49:05,701 --> 00:49:10,080
and I thought I was kind of past the
point of new discoveries, you know,

731
00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:14,730
I'm 69 years old and kind of everything
is pretty much routine. So Emma,

732
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:18,780
there was a little bit of high excitement
there that I may have opened up a new,

733
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:22,180
a new vein and the old, you know,
margin testing, I don't know.

734
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:26,230
Yeah. So, but you still,
your movement afterwards, it
was standard. It was normal.

735
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,650
Yeah. It was standard.
Yeah, no, absolutely.

736
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:30,970
That's really something,

737
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:35,160
you know, you, you, you just came
to Thanksgiving and of course that,

738
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,750
that changes your,
you know,

739
00:49:36,751 --> 00:49:40,500
you have a lot of things in quantity
and stuff you don't normally have. So,

740
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,930
oh, this was, this was the thanksgiving.

741
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:48,340
No, it was a pre thanksgiving, but just
coming through thanksgiving, you know, uh,

742
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:52,380
you know, I should, uh, I'm
back to doing, you know,

743
00:49:52,381 --> 00:49:55,930
I had basically a twos and three
there ever since thanksgiving.

744
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:01,370
Wow. That's good. Anyway, but I,

745
00:50:01,371 --> 00:50:03,670
I would just stop by that
one. Smell. I've never,

746
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:06,990
two is a little hard. It's hard,
but threes and fours are ideal.

747
00:50:06,991 --> 00:50:10,870
So if you haven't twos and threes, I would
say fours and fives are ideal for me.

748
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:14,740
No five's too sloppy.
Threes and fours are the ideal.

749
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,220
I don't think so. I think, no, it's
not a matter of opinion of me. Look,

750
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:23,410
the reason for is or where you want
to be. Yeah. Yeah. I know this stuff.

751
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,980
I go four or five. Don't go for
a five. It's too sloppy. You

752
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,920
went threes and fours. I believe
me, I've studied this stuff.

753
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:36,800
I know the whole scale. When's your
colonoscopy? It's next one. Hold on.

754
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:41,990
You want a four and now you're right.
Three or four. You want to four, right?

755
00:50:41,991 --> 00:50:45,140
That's what I just to
three is kind of hard,

756
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:48,400
a sausage shape with cracks in
the surface. But that's all right.

757
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:53,530
You want a smooth soft sausage
or snake? Four. Four. Yeah.
No, sorry, go ahead. Okay.

758
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,050
Smelled that smell before.

759
00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:00,770
Yeah. I mean having a new, I
kind of know what you mean.

760
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:02,203
Um,

761
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:07,440
one thing that was weird was I was on
a flight last week and somebody kept

762
00:51:08,471 --> 00:51:12,450
farting and it was the same smells. I knew
it was the same guy. It's far too. Yeah.

763
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:18,060
And then about two hours into the flight
I farted and my fart smelled like his

764
00:51:18,101 --> 00:51:19,780
fart.
That was weird.

765
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:25,160
That was weird. Yeah. I couldn't
be, I tell you, we are, we are.

766
00:51:25,161 --> 00:51:28,400
We get on like,
like you're on a tram or something,

767
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:30,711
you know,
people,

768
00:51:30,711 --> 00:51:35,150
but sitting down so they stand up and
I am the 80 do that a lot in Florida

769
00:51:35,151 --> 00:51:36,140
because you know,

770
00:51:36,141 --> 00:51:40,580
if it would cold weather climates and
you have a party kind of get in a crowd,

771
00:51:40,581 --> 00:51:41,600
it kind of hides in your,

772
00:51:41,601 --> 00:51:46,060
your overcoat or jacket or wear
everywhere and you know, it doesn't,

773
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:48,650
but time it gets out,
it's kind of diluted.

774
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:53,680
But if you live in a hot weather climate
like Florida or la and that summertime

775
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:58,970
when you're Fart, it's out
there. You know, there's,
there's an escape hatch. Okay.

776
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:01,170
Oh yeah. And uh, you know,

777
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:04,440
yeah. So, uh, and then people,

778
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:11,240
people, uh, you know, then they all
look around, you know, there's like,

779
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:15,050
you always know, the people that don't
look around are the ones that did it.

780
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:18,230
Yeah. Interesting. Yeah,
you're right. Yeah. Yeah.

781
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:20,370
I do it.
I always look,

782
00:52:20,371 --> 00:52:25,020
I always look around with like this
discussed of what the hell's going on.

783
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,900
Yeah.
Kind of to kind of misguide them

784
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,160
all.
The other times I went to this one

785
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:37,220
conversations with my dad, or like an
eye, I'll reciprocate. I'll be like, oh,

786
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:40,670
I'll say this back. And then he'll
be like, so something else I did.

787
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:46,370
Yeah. And yeah, there was an older person
in front of me, so they don't know.

788
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:49,350
They're not aware if
somebody is behind them,

789
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:52,590
sometimes we're not aware of
somebody in front of him. Okay. Yeah.

790
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:57,450
And so they had no idea. And all of
a sudden this not only hedge smell,

791
00:52:57,451 --> 00:53:00,780
but it had noise too. I have
no idea. Somebody is them

792
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:02,550
and they find it a big one,
Huh?

793
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,170
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And, and then,

794
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,980
and then when they step up to the counter
and they realize you're behind, you're,

795
00:53:09,981 --> 00:53:14,600
they, they, they pretend they don't
have any ownership of the problem.

796
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:15,800
You don't. Right, right.

797
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,740
I remember one time I was, uh,
I'll never forget, you know,

798
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:20,990
just memories that just stick with you.

799
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:25,800
I share an office with this guy also
named Tom when I was working in DC.

800
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:31,200
Columbia. Yeah. Uh, that was
working at a America's most wanted,

801
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:36,270
he was a producer and Onair guy. And
I was just a researcher, so I was 20,

802
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,160
um,
and he,

803
00:53:38,161 --> 00:53:42,600
or maybe 21 and he was probably 40
at the time and we both like hip hop.

804
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:45,120
So one time we just
went to a record store,

805
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:49,770
like during lunch break just to
look at the records. And this guy,

806
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:54,360
this was back when there was record
stores everywhere and they had headphone

807
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,970
stations. You remember that
whenever it came to that.

808
00:53:56,971 --> 00:54:00,690
So you put headphones on and they would
have like five or six things you could

809
00:54:00,691 --> 00:54:03,600
listen to at the time. Sure, sure.
So these are albums that are out.

810
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:08,990
So this big guy is standing there
with headphones on and he hits like,

811
00:54:09,631 --> 00:54:11,400
so obviously you can't hear
what he's listening to,

812
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:13,990
but he's singing the notes
singing the song. He was like,

813
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:19,890
and as he hits the high note,
he rips a massive fart. Right.

814
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,360
But it was so weird because he turned
around and looked at us cause we were

815
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:27,330
busting out laughing and it was all,
he looked at us like,

816
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:31,280
oh you laughing at my voice. I think
he didn't know that he farted. Yeah.

817
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:34,930
Because when you're wearing your ear buds,
even in here,

818
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,190
you don't hear your far. And I
think because he was singing, yeah,

819
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:41,820
he didn't actually realize that he
pushed out a fart because I've had that

820
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:45,960
happen before when I've been on treadmills
where you're farting and you think

821
00:54:45,961 --> 00:54:49,960
it's silent and maybe it's not
and everyone could hear it. Sure.

822
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:51,960
That's a real common problem.
Yeah.

823
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:56,830
Yeah. I know what you mean. Um, did don't
tell mom about this new smell or no,

824
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,650
no, no. This is where it gets good.

825
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:06,070
She's in the other room.
She's not into this.

826
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:11,660
I haven't told her baptist. Is she
around by any chance? Can of talk to her.

827
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:16,090
You can talk to her. Hold on. Okay.
Hold on. Let me bring up right away.

828
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,310
I'm both of you then when you
took this side. Yeah, it's good.

829
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:22,900
It can wear on you
sometimes. Um, what's up?

830
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,870
Did you know that he had a
new fart smell the other day?

831
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:33,430
Yeah, he said after all these years
he has about eight to 10 fart smells

832
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:38,880
so great.

833
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:44,510
I'm so disappointed she disappointed at
you or doesn't want to hear about it.

834
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,460
Doesn't want to hear about it.
Which Tom she referring to when you are,

835
00:55:47,461 --> 00:55:52,190
you're telling me it's
telling me. I thought I heard
I Tom, which made me laugh.

836
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,360
I thought it was your dad.
Yeah.

837
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:58,700
No, I did them come and you have a new,

838
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:09,260
you should see how serious
he you sending me. It is

839
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:15,430
a my life. Okay. Person
hated in my life. Who?

840
00:56:15,431 --> 00:56:19,600
The person I'm talking about this middle
of the French and kicking him out is

841
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:20,693
anyone can do

842
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:32,180
70 oh, by the way, I want to tell you in
front of him. This is serious. Yeah. Yeah.

843
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:36,780
Oh my God. It hurts to hear. Say,
yeah, it's only wants to talk over you.

844
00:56:36,781 --> 00:56:40,270
I don't know. I want to talk to you.
Oh, okay. Did they remember you?

845
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:43,630
I don't want to talk about farts,
but this is like,

846
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:47,830
can you mag it smells.
I mean definitely still.

847
00:56:47,831 --> 00:56:52,660
How does it know when to change your
[inaudible] part? It will make so much.

848
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:56,360
I didn't recognize the smell of yours.

849
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:05,230
Let me see. When I farted.
I do recognize this man.

850
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:07,090
I know it's a new one,

851
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:10,000
but isn't that kind of amazing
when you think about it

852
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:14,790
then tell me. I cannot believe
that. I mean, I know if it,

853
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:17,040
mine is metal doesn't
smell as far as I know.

854
00:57:17,041 --> 00:57:20,500
But to recognize the smell of this heart.
He says there's a new one.

855
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:23,580
He says he has eight to 10
different smells that he recognizes.

856
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:28,010
Yeah. I want to put you on a
speaker. Yeah, hold on. Okay.

857
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,450
Oh crap. Damn. Yeah.

858
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,980
You said you have eight
to 10 different yeah.

859
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:39,490
Different snow in the kid from China.
Okay.

860
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:42,080
So I know by the way my car.
Oh,

861
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:45,250
what kind of taxes did you hear that?
Yeah.

862
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:49,023
Testing.

863
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:52,210
Well isn't it? He's, he's,
it's kind of a, a nice, uh,

864
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,110
a skill that he has that
he knows what's coming.

865
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:59,190
I just needed to know about history.
Know about the flowers.

866
00:57:59,191 --> 00:58:03,660
I know like the smell of the flower.
Roseway Iranian.

867
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:08,310
Oh, I know what butterflies coming by. The
color of this. Tell me about the fight.

868
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:13,250
What kind of,
but dad can do.

869
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:18,840
Dad knows the age that she's the
one that skill that's for shoots,

870
00:58:18,841 --> 00:58:19,674
can God.
Okay.

871
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:23,640
But he also wanted to give him discovered.
I think that the real thing is it,

872
00:58:23,641 --> 00:58:26,220
not only does he have that
skill after all these years,

873
00:58:26,221 --> 00:58:30,070
he was able to detect a new smell,
which is really signal.

874
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:35,180
Yeah. That really was kind
of like, ah, you know,

875
00:58:35,181 --> 00:58:38,030
it's like we ended a stronger
word finding a new planet.

876
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:42,720
Yeah, that's really true. Yeah.
It's like they, they find,

877
00:58:42,721 --> 00:58:45,450
they find new new solar
systems and galaxies.

878
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,330
How long,

879
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:52,010
how Lope Andrew did on your own that
you're going to live at Gordon to their

880
00:58:52,011 --> 00:58:56,870
fights and this male [inaudible]
that would be my goal and my,

881
00:58:56,871 --> 00:58:59,980
the meditation where we live,
I might have went on to be a ration card.

882
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:03,770
When you go to the bathroom, knowing
what's coming to see, I'm retired, I paid,

883
00:59:03,771 --> 00:59:08,450
I know it's coming today and I am
a lot of toilet paper.

884
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,670
I need an extra role.

885
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,760
So is the main the main advantage
to knowing what's coming?

886
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:16,470
Just toilet paper usage?

887
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,660
Nope.
Actually toilet paper.

888
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:24,650
Then the real main advantage is you know
how close you are and sometimes they

889
00:59:24,651 --> 00:59:27,710
come quicker than others. You
know, they don't come quick,

890
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:31,810
so do certain fart smells, let you know
you're going to have a really explosive,

891
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,170
huge shit.
Yes.

892
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:36,100
By I all. Absolutely.
Yeah. That I tell you.

893
00:59:36,101 --> 00:59:40,030
I know because sometimes we're talking
and then he runs out. I guess. I'm sorry.

894
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:43,070
I'm sorry. I'm good. He out. Say, ah.

895
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,030
I knew that I thought
was going to be a five,

896
00:59:46,031 --> 00:59:49,060
but it wasn't the biggest exploding. I
said, don't please don't go the leaders

897
00:59:50,350 --> 00:59:54,610
an eight and it goes all over them.
Oh Wow.

898
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,520
Well, I really clear. It's really,

899
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:01,430
I don't think you do have that discussing
as your fired because to call that

900
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:05,970
really cool. I think that's awesome that
he has that skill in a book. I don't,

901
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:09,680
I don't know, like I'm not at dad's level,
but I, I have some Cochise that yeah,

902
01:00:09,681 --> 01:00:13,690
they paint the ball and stuff. Yeah, yeah,

903
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:16,940
yeah.
I'm going to teach my son.

904
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:19,130
It's going to pass it down
from generation to generation.

905
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,060
Absolutely.

906
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:26,060
I'd be sure to be sure to be sure that
your phone knows that he's getting mad.

907
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:29,520
Never argue with any of
this disgusting stuff. Okay?

908
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:33,360
You should be hearing protection. Okaka
don't forget to talk about God. I made it.

909
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:38,070
Okay? I gotta go. I love you guys. Okay?

910
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,990
Yeah, but you know what? I
don't see. You said that you go,

911
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:42,350
you talk about [inaudible].

912
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:44,590
Do I have you forgot to say
I'm walking into a meeting.

913
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,630
Somebody here at the house. I have to
go. That's the reason why I got to go.

914
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:53,700
I said, if only for the
person I, he did. Okay. I'm in
another room. I love you guys.

915
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,730
Okay? I love that.
Okay. Bye. There you go.

916
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,570
Your mom does the same thing I do to
you because you always go, I gotta go.

917
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:03,510
I gotta let you go. Here you go.
So rude. I gotta let you go. Yeah.

918
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:08,140
That was probably one of the best calls
and a long time. I laughed so hard, man.

919
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:11,700
My stomach hurts from that call.
I love how upset Charro gets.

920
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:14,560
That's the best part is how upset she is

921
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:20,720
and how disappointed she
was when she found out what
you guys were talking about.

922
01:01:20,721 --> 01:01:22,850
Oh yeah, and she's disappointed in you. I

923
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:27,960
she couldn't read. What was it
here? I think it was here. Hi. Hi.

924
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,233
He said,

925
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:34,080
after all these years he has about eight
to 10 fart smells and he had a new smell

926
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,960
is, believe me, it's my favorite
thing too. That's why I do this.

927
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:46,620
Disappointment is so profound
in you, right then. Yes.

928
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:52,150
So fun. I'll both of you then when
you took this, that's funny. She goes,

929
01:01:52,151 --> 01:01:54,760
how bored do you get? What you talking
to your friend and you sometimes.

930
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:00,580
What's up? Did you know that he
had a new fart smell the other day?

931
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:08,140
Yeah. He said after all these years
he had eight to 10 fart smells.

932
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:10,090
Any of that new smell.

933
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:14,293
The smells.

934
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:20,370
She's so disappointed

935
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:21,790
in you right there.
Yeah.

936
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:26,340
I don't think I've ever heard her and
usually she just gets angry. Yeah,

937
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:29,140
but this was thorough disgust,

938
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:33,030
contempt and obsessiveness
at you and your dad.

939
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:37,650
It's a very nuanced emotion for Charlie.
This one's a little more than once.

940
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,640
Usually she just goes
to rage. Ah. So funny.

941
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:45,960
I don't want to hear, oh, I thought it
was your shit. Both from the streets.

942
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:49,250
That's how I like my answers.
It itch.

943
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:53,500
And so that's when she's a bit
Ghostface man. Yeah, she is. Yeah.

944
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:56,880
You know what I thought was really neat,
which you have been teaching.

945
01:02:56,881 --> 01:02:59,460
Our son is in the mornings.
You and I,

946
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:04,490
we get our coffee together and he'd go
into his room and we wake him up or he's

947
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:09,600
already up and we have like a family
time and there's a, there's a,

948
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:11,310
a rocking chair I sit in,

949
01:03:11,311 --> 01:03:15,270
I said was sitting there with Ellis and
you are sitting on like a plastic chair,

950
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,100
like a step,
the step stool.

951
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:20,940
And you are in your dad boxers like
you normally are with your, uh,

952
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:26,330
your slippers and just a shirt and you're
sitting on this plastic stool and your

953
01:03:26,971 --> 01:03:31,971
legs were spread open and the fabric was
pulling against up against your nuts.

954
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:32,601
Yeah.

955
01:03:32,601 --> 01:03:37,590
So we could see just a hint
of balls to the side to side.

956
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:39,540
Yeah.
And you spread your legs,

957
01:03:39,541 --> 01:03:43,050
you lifted the legs in the
air and then you farted. Yeah,

958
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:47,410
it was like a snap, snap,
snap, snap, snap, snap, like
firecrackers and the street.

959
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:51,900
And it was cool that our son
got to see that firsthand. Yeah,

960
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:57,360
it was pretty cool. I agree. It was
kind of like a that uh, what's that? Um,

961
01:03:58,190 --> 01:04:03,030
that, that great art that he had a kick
ass ripper. It was sitting on a dresser.

962
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:08,190
Right, right. His Dresser Fart. That's it.

963
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:12,960
A getaway.

964
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:17,410
Yeah. Good one. That's a neat thing.
Yeah. Yeah. Oh my God. That was so good.

965
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:24,370
Now how does your dad was another clip
from, uh, when I talked to my mom too.

966
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:27,700
I have a question though.
Earlier she was like, ask them,

967
01:04:27,701 --> 01:04:31,190
will you ever date your mom? I was
like, yeah, mom, what do you would,

968
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:36,830
would you do mom? Um, so
how does your dad hold it?

969
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,290
Does he hold in these as
a, the men? No, no, no.

970
01:04:39,291 --> 01:04:42,370
So how does he fired around your mother
who has honored contempt for them?

971
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:47,200
He just does and he'll be
like, baby, I go, it just came
out. I got it. I got to go.

972
01:04:47,201 --> 01:04:49,390
She goes, well, go to the
bathroom. And he's like,

973
01:04:49,391 --> 01:04:51,020
I don't want it to go to the
bathroom. She was like, this is this.

974
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:55,030
And then he'll get matches and stuff,
you know? And She just gets upset.

975
01:04:55,090 --> 01:04:58,570
She just yelled. But she loves
it. Ha. Yeah. I have to say,

976
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:02,200
I think one of the greatest things about
our relationship is that we just fart

977
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:07,060
in front of each other because could you
imagine 2040 years of having to get up

978
01:05:07,061 --> 01:05:09,400
and go to the bathroom? We know
people like that though. I know.

979
01:05:09,401 --> 01:05:13,390
But that's especially because your dad
has a sickness. He has a diverticulitis.

980
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:18,220
So those a rancid, it's medical.
Have you smelled? Of course.

981
01:05:18,221 --> 01:05:21,490
I've known him for years. Of
course. Bad. It's disgusting.

982
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:23,520
It's really rancid.

983
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:28,530
His farts are like just
wallpaper peeling any crazy.

984
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:33,580
So I wanted to play this
for you. This woman, uh,

985
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:39,280
Shah's Rad Morgan. She's an
author of the book, the fuck list.

986
01:05:39,850 --> 01:05:44,850
A memoir about the two years after her
divorce where she fucked a lot of dudes.

987
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:48,850
Cool. Um, we always talk
about this. Yeah. Oh yeah.

988
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:54,000
We're going to blow bang whenever
after. Oh yeah. And by the way, yeah,

989
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:55,333
you

990
01:05:56,690 --> 01:06:01,690
had a dream and then you tried
to kind of like dismiss it later.

991
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:06,970
You're like, ah, yeah, whatever was just
dream where you said I watched you, right?

992
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:07,630
No,

993
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:12,630
the dream was you had an idea for a bit
for your mom's house where I blow the

994
01:06:13,751 --> 01:06:18,450
entire cast of Juggalos. This is your
dream. This isn't my dream. Yeah. And I,

995
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:22,240
I went through with it. I did it.
Reluctantly reluctant. No, I just did it.

996
01:06:22,241 --> 01:06:26,280
I didn't think. Yeah. And then afterwards
I was talking to Bryce about it. Yeah.

997
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:30,310
Brace was like, wow, you
really blew all those guys.

998
01:06:30,311 --> 01:06:33,160
It was really crazy. And then I had
second thoughts. I was like, oh,

999
01:06:33,161 --> 01:06:37,150
we can't air that. We can't air that.
Right. And then I go, that's your concern.

1000
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:41,230
And then I go, Tom, I blew all the
guys in Gigolos. We can air this bit.

1001
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:46,030
This is going to, it's a
ruin my reputation as a
lady. Yeah. And that was it.

1002
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,760
Yeah. Look at him. And I
liked it as you, your dream.

1003
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:54,400
Tell your shrink about that one.
Let me know what she says.

1004
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:59,680
Who I roll. I mean, you're like, oh,
I had this dream like, like somebody,

1005
01:06:59,681 --> 01:07:02,080
it sounds like someone really twisted
your arm. He's like, well I just did it.

1006
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:07,240
I blew these five guys. But I
only remember blowing like, whoa.

1007
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:10,930
I only remember, I only remember one
Peter. Really? Yeah, like in the dream.

1008
01:07:10,931 --> 01:07:15,130
I didn't go one. You remember who was it
was through the braces. The Jesus guy.

1009
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:18,370
No sprays. It was praise God. You
blew brace in your dream. Right.

1010
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:20,980
But then I didn't,
I just remember seeing the painter.

1011
01:07:20,981 --> 01:07:24,790
I don't remember it like doing anything.
And then I remember Bryce being like,

1012
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:28,550
wow.
And then I asked to take the bed out.

1013
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,640
The breeze philosophy,
philosophy,

1014
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:36,530
philosophy, degrees, philosophy.

1015
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:45,800
You blew them. Yeah. And your
dream really cool babe. You got it.

1016
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:51,010
Hi. I'm sure was at Morgan.
I'm author of the fuck list.

1017
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:55,940
So this is a very unusual video. I
have come all over my face, kind of.

1018
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:59,430
You can see it and thank you
Brandon for leaving it there for me.

1019
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:06,010
Bryce. Uh, it looks good. It looks
like a nice lady. She did. Yeah,

1020
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:10,300
she did before she said that.
Well,

1021
01:08:10,301 --> 01:08:13,750
I don't know why you have to make a
video of come on your face, Donny.

1022
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:16,520
Well she's going to tell you why
we've all had come on our face.

1023
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:21,320
The reason I'm showing this to you is
because I want you guys to realize that

1024
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:26,690
come to me as a woman come just to be
something really disgusting and gross and

1025
01:08:26,691 --> 01:08:29,840
slimy and I would have never
let a guy do that on my face.

1026
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:32,210
I concerted so disrespectful.

1027
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:38,890
I want to tell you how I came to see
calm is not some Yucky slobby slimy stuff

1028
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:45,250
and make it something that turns me on
and this is how I realize by talking to

1029
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:49,730
men, they associate the come with
their pleasure with their orgasm.

1030
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:54,410
They will identify with it almost
like a woman might identify with her.

1031
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:57,240
I don't know,
with our hair,

1032
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:00,860
something about our bodies that we like.

1033
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:06,640
She's a really weird accent and she's,
is there some kind of expectation? Yeah,

1034
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:11,750
but so far I'm 100% on board with her.
Do you agree with that?

1035
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:15,990
That is an extension absolutely.
In guys do identify,

1036
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:18,450
identify it with their pleasure and
everything. I think that's that part.

1037
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:23,750
And so the fact that it repulses
me is that bad. Um, it's just,

1038
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:27,860
it's just reality. I just
have to deal with it. I mean,
I wish it wasn't like that,

1039
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,850
if that's what you're asking.
I wish it were a candy flavored.

1040
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:35,000
Mine tastes pretty good
as far as I remember.

1041
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:38,360
I had a couple of cups of it last
week wasn't, it wasn't that bad

1042
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:39,613
and

1043
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:46,500
not only up for a man has come is
a very precious part of himself

1044
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:51,330
at all. He loves his
comedy, still proud of it.

1045
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:55,320
She looks at it like it turns him
on when he sees it coming out.

1046
01:09:55,680 --> 01:10:00,680
He's proud of it because like he
sees how much there is parked shoots.

1047
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:04,200
It's a measure of his manliness,
you know,

1048
01:10:04,201 --> 01:10:08,130
like there's so many things about it
and when he could come on a woman,

1049
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:12,000
it makes him feel so close to her.
He's giving her part of himself. Right.

1050
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:16,700
This lady's a genius. Can I tell
you something? Or eyes are really,

1051
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,080
everything's right.
Can I tell you some?

1052
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:21,780
What's so great is when women
get hosed into this horse shit,

1053
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:26,000
that guy's feel things about their calm
and we need to be more respectful of

1054
01:10:26,001 --> 01:10:29,940
letting guys come on. Gimme a break. Yeah.

1055
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:32,990
This one is a little bit
about cell phones practices.

1056
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:36,740
I practiced as a white tigress for about
a year. Then the oral sex tradition,

1057
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:40,250
there's a lot of things. For
example, we have a technique,

1058
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:42,193
she talks weird.

1059
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:47,890
They both king deeply the penis and
you're almost like gagging on it.

1060
01:10:48,201 --> 01:10:50,590
And when I first heard about
this technique and then solid,

1061
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,430
I was like saw my goodness.

1062
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:56,750
And it was like the instant thing that
came up in me was that it's degrading to

1063
01:10:56,751 --> 01:10:59,840
women or the technique where
you're holding the back
of the head and the man is

1064
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:04,190
holding her head and then
circling has hips and holding.

1065
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:09,190
How day this lady's cool is she
needs a mill approval too much.

1066
01:11:10,190 --> 01:11:12,380
What's going on? What is this?
Why can't this get addressed?

1067
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:16,560
It seems like the eyes, oh, I got that.
No, I'm not like that. What's going on?

1068
01:11:16,561 --> 01:11:21,440
Their bags. She's old. Yeah.
But I mean God damn, she
should put come on those bags.

1069
01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:23,250
What I'm saying,
there's so much.

1070
01:11:23,251 --> 01:11:25,680
So much bags and you've got all
this access to all this come.

1071
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:28,870
Why don't you marrying the two?
Right. If it's a skin tightener. Yeah,

1072
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:31,360
cause I think she'll get more
calm, which she loves. She,

1073
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:34,180
if she takes care of those eyes,
her teeth look good though.

1074
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:38,280
She don't tell us your teeth look good.
She's an attractive woman. I know,

1075
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:41,940
but these are real bad.
Real well I can't. Exactly,

1076
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:45,580
and she has come on her face.
I keep forgetting that it's on the,

1077
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:52,020
I guess it's kind of dried. It's
usually gets flaky, right? Yeah. Crusty

1078
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:55,950
and it's a turn on. It's not
disrespectful. Great teeth.

1079
01:11:56,390 --> 01:12:01,390
You can see that like guys come
on in your body or anything.

1080
01:12:01,421 --> 01:12:06,421
Like if guys come on your face or in
your body or anything like they just,

1081
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:12,580
they just will. It's just such a
respectful, loving act to deal. Thank you.

1082
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,770
No leverage.
With riverbed,

1083
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:21,640
the guys,
she's a sesame street character.

1084
01:12:23,650 --> 01:12:28,210
So after they come on my face,
I like to rub it in and it makes really,

1085
01:12:28,211 --> 01:12:32,140
really good.
Facial skin is so smooth.

1086
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:34,163
Yeah.

1087
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:38,420
God Damn Hoes job you're talking about
and she's totally hosed this bride in

1088
01:12:38,421 --> 01:12:39,254
more than one way.

1089
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:42,940
The only thing is when I get into my eyes,

1090
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:45,070
it makes my eyes burn a
little bit and no shit.

1091
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:48,310
I get in my eyes because I like to
look at the men when they're coming.

1092
01:12:48,311 --> 01:12:52,660
I like to look in their eyes and I like
to see the come come out of their penis

1093
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:58,930
and Charles Murray on now. So I opened
my eyes to look and then always,

1094
01:12:58,931 --> 01:13:03,640
I always get some in my eyes, so I have
to figure out how to get better at that.

1095
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:07,900
Yeah, you got to get better at that
needs really oversexed I think.

1096
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:10,380
I think this is too much of
a focal point in her life.

1097
01:13:10,381 --> 01:13:14,090
I'm going to go out on a limb and say that
she's talking like a fucking teenager.

1098
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:18,770
She might have been really super
repressed I think so. This is her reverse?

1099
01:13:19,070 --> 01:13:23,540
I think so, yeah. Because usually when
people lead with the sexuality card,

1100
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:27,410
it's their whole thing.
I like to watch, come,

1101
01:13:27,411 --> 01:13:32,260
come out on the come lady. I'm come
face lady, come on my face. I rub it in.

1102
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:37,190
It's definitely, you're right, it's
years of repression and now she's,

1103
01:13:37,191 --> 01:13:41,900
she's the official. Come on my face
lady. It's so funny. I love by the way,

1104
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:43,910
the thought always being that like,
oh,

1105
01:13:43,911 --> 01:13:47,330
you really gotta be so accepting of
guys to get them to be indie. Like, no,

1106
01:13:47,331 --> 01:13:48,170
you don't.
You don't need them.

1107
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:51,470
You don't need the guy to come
on your face for someone to come.

1108
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:54,260
You know what I mean? Like dudes
will come no matter what, dude,

1109
01:13:54,290 --> 01:13:55,123
don't worry about it.

1110
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:59,150
Can we stop fucking worrying about
their feelings about their fucking calm.

1111
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:04,010
You don't want to, we don't have to
worry about guys know why. Who Cares?

1112
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:08,690
What do you mean? I'm just saying that
they're not an underserved demographic.

1113
01:14:08,691 --> 01:14:12,310
Sexually. Men historically.

need to take care of baby.

shirts on sale on the website.

I read an email that we got?

1127
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:03,160
Please read an email that we got.

1128
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:11,620
Okay. Ready? Yeah. Can you please
settle this debate once and for all?

1129
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:16,060
My wife and I argue all the time about
wiping techniques and we are in need of a

1130
01:15:16,061 --> 01:15:19,030
neutral third party to weigh
in on the subject Grady.

1131
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:24,880
So I myself am a sane person and I wiped
from front to back until the toilet

1132
01:15:24,881 --> 01:15:29,080
paper more or less comes back white.
She on the other hand,

1133
01:15:29,270 --> 01:15:33,040
goes back to front wiping
shit towards the clit.

1134
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:36,760
She justifies this aggressive,

1135
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:42,060
she justifies this by saying she has
this claw technique where she essentially

1136
01:15:42,551 --> 01:15:44,770
uses toilet paper as a make shift.

1137
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:49,140
Shitty finger condom scoops it
out from inside the beholder,

1138
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,470
so make sure she gets it all.

1139
01:15:50,770 --> 01:15:54,730
I agree her bunk hall is probably
definitely a lot cleaner than mine,

1140
01:15:54,731 --> 01:15:59,380
but what are you mommy's thinking? My
crazy. It's real crazy. Sounds a really,

1141
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:04,520
really aggressive on a lot of levels.
Wiping back to front is never recommended.

1142
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:08,650
No for nobody in that. She claws
at it and just, Oh man, wait.

1143
01:16:08,651 --> 01:16:09,550
Let me just see though.

1144
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:14,820
I do see the point like she went like
this with the paper in there that the

1145
01:16:15,361 --> 01:16:19,210
problem is you aren't putting Cutco on
your machine and that's not sanitary.

1146
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,440
You can also do the claw
through a reverse claw.

1147
01:16:22,441 --> 01:16:27,441
Do a claw front to pull out and use
your thumb as the claw right away from

1148
01:16:28,481 --> 01:16:32,680
there. No, you should definitely reverse
your claw. You should get the toto.

1149
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:37,420
Yeah, get the total washlet three
50 on Amazon using our banner.

1150
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:41,050
It's really the best podcasts.
Did you know that?

1151
01:16:41,051 --> 01:16:44,230
That the button that turns it on.
If you press it twice,

1152
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:46,420
that's how you get hard pressure.
No,

1153
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:49,780
it's soft on off and then there's stop.

1154
01:16:50,070 --> 01:16:54,720
So you do soft on the second time.
Makes it hard. You're fucking kidding.

1155
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:58,900
Cause I've just been increasing the
pressure by pushing the button. Wow,

1156
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,333
that's amazing.

1157
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:06,780
So we are using the washlet
from the nineties we got
the total three 50 and love

1158
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:12,230
and you do the model number
because the guy at the total store,

1159
01:17:12,231 --> 01:17:15,410
I went to their showroom and he walked
me through it and he goes oh you got to

1160
01:17:15,411 --> 01:17:20,411
get the three 50 that's the latest model
and get it on Amazon and it's pretty

1161
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:21,520
painless to hookup.

1162
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:25,550
You need to have an outlet by the
toilet and the water sources there.

1163
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:30,920
This thing has a remote control,
a heated seat. You just basically,

1164
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:32,900
it's like your old shit to shower thing.

1165
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:37,790
I mean I still like to do a
cursory wipe wash. Let uh sure.

1166
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:42,170
I'll do like a wipe. Why and then
I let it rip. Yeah. Why do you,

1167
01:17:42,171 --> 01:17:46,730
why do you do that's what the wash led
is for. No, I still like to do one wipe

1168
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:50,390
cause if you have a like
a lot of Kaka there,

1169
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:54,730
you don't have a big hairy asshole like
me. So yeah, I'll do like a cursory why,

1170
01:17:54,731 --> 01:17:56,450
but I just, I don't even
look, I just wipe it,

1171
01:17:56,451 --> 01:18:00,230
drop it and then I hit on and
then I just let that stream go.

1172
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:04,490
I mean there's nothing on the
paper afterwards. It's amazing.

1173
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,390
Have you used the dryer? Yeah.
That's so nice. It's a nice,

1174
01:18:08,391 --> 01:18:09,560
it's a hairdryer and your asshole.

1175
01:18:09,610 --> 01:18:14,540
It's a hair like a full powered with art
there is the front setting and then the

1176
01:18:14,541 --> 01:18:15,374
rear settings.

1177
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:19,140
But as a woman I have to use the
frontline so it pushes the Kaka away.

1178
01:18:19,450 --> 01:18:20,690
Do you know what I'm
saying? Yeah, I understand.

1179
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,360
You can't do the front
to the back to front.

1180
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:26,570
We got a horrible are hilarious
clip to watch. I haven't watched it.

1181
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,210
Do you want to weigh in?
We'll see what you think.

1182
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:38,020
What the fuck?
Ah,

1183
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:47,050
ah,
ah.

1184
01:18:47,850 --> 01:18:49,280
My fucking nuts.

1185
01:18:52,050 --> 01:18:56,700
Jesus. What were you thinking
dude? What accent master?

1186
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:02,340
I think this guy was driving. So
when you ask, what were you thinking?

1187
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:03,810
I think I have a pretty good idea.

1188
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:08,960
Not a whole fucking lot past the dope
summer of 63 that's what I was thinking.

1189
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:12,030
Jesus. Yeah. He goes,

1190
01:19:13,450 --> 01:19:16,860
did you hear that?
I don't think it's funny.

1191
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:23,300
Bummed
out.

1192
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:36,350
It's pretty funny.
Well,

1193
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:39,490
I think it's a bummer that that's the
guy that hits you. That fucking cunt.

1194
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:43,730
That Kippy asshole smoking dope.
Yeah.

1195
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:49,110
All over my face.

1196
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:53,760
I have come all over my
car and I really like it.

1197
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:57,430
It's an excellent skin softener show.

1198
01:19:58,830 --> 01:20:02,220
Aw, I don't like it in my,
Oh, he's at birds, boy.

1199
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:08,400
Super Dumb. Dumb. Do you see the
Hungarian email? I did. That's funny.

1200
01:20:08,401 --> 01:20:12,090
You notice that? Read it though.
Okay. It says, dear main mommy,

1201
01:20:12,091 --> 01:20:16,800
Tina and surfer of the water
champ champ thrown Tom.

1202
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:20,040
You surfer. Yeah. Hmm. Okay.

1203
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:22,220
Inspired by your wonderful podcast.

1204
01:20:22,221 --> 01:20:27,110
I pulled my jeans up high and tight and
sent off for a DNA kit from 23 and me,

1205
01:20:27,111 --> 01:20:28,760
I use the word I use,
the code.

1206
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:33,210
Bird has fat jeans to pay an extra
20% to pay an extra 20 bucks,

1207
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,510
which goes towards Burt's
liposuction surgery.

1208
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:39,680
I received the kit fluid bonded with
a test tube and a few weeks later I

1209
01:20:39,681 --> 01:20:43,640
received my results. The test identified
several very close blood relatives.

1210
01:20:43,641 --> 01:20:48,641
I didn't know I had you see my mom was
adopted and found her bio mother several

1211
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:48,681
years ago,

1212
01:20:48,681 --> 01:20:53,681
but she never found out the identity of
her bio father threw some detective work

1213
01:20:54,411 --> 01:20:59,411
and by comparing DNA results on
another website called g d match.

1214
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:03,410
Um, they compare DNA from
different testing companies.

1215
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:08,210
I discovered my mom's biological father.
Hmm. His last name was Joe Hahn sick.

1216
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:13,590
Does that sound, how'd you say it? Oh No,
you have to spell it. J. O. H. A. N C.

1217
01:21:13,591 --> 01:21:14,510
I s.
I k.

1218
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:18,140
Yo hand shake at sound check.
All right,

1219
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:23,060
well he was 100% cockroach
DNA having Hungarian.

1220
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:27,230
That makes me 25% Hungarian.
Excellent. We'll do. I know.

1221
01:21:27,231 --> 01:21:29,210
How do I connect with
my eastern bloc routes?

1222
01:21:29,330 --> 01:21:31,940
Is there anything special about
being Hungarian? Should I take this?

1223
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:33,770
Go dancing and start being rude to people.

1224
01:21:33,771 --> 01:21:37,190
Should I plan a pilgrimage to
Budapest? Yes. I'm really lost here.

1225
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:39,840
See you at the next family reunion.
Yeah.

1226
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:43,890
Andy p s my wife and I saw Tina
and Houston a while back. Uh,

1227
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:48,310
we already have tickets to see the fake
water champ time when he comes to town.

1228
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:49,173
Unbelievable.

1229
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:53,720
And as you'd say in Hungarian. [inaudible]
yeah, I think that's wonderful.

1230
01:21:53,721 --> 01:21:58,670
I think you should go to Budapest.
You said you should start eating sausage,

1231
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:03,800
drinking beer and abusing your body
because you can cause you got cockroach

1232
01:22:03,830 --> 01:22:07,940
eastern bloc DNA also,
uh, work on your scowl,

1233
01:22:08,570 --> 01:22:12,980
right Tom? Yeah. Work on your depressive
illness. You're going to need it. Yup. No,

1234
01:22:12,981 --> 01:22:17,510
it's nice. It's beautiful. Beautiful
cursing. Get, get a good curse. Going.

1235
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:23,090
A disdain for humanity. You got to work
on that a little bit. I think it's cool.

1236
01:22:23,091 --> 01:22:26,240
You should go check it out.
It's fun. Yeah. It's fun. How,

1237
01:22:26,270 --> 01:22:30,440
how grumpy some of them are. I don't
know if they are anymore, but you know,

1238
01:22:30,740 --> 01:22:33,980
last time I went shoes,
everybody in my family's grumpy,

1239
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:39,960
super grumpy stirs. That's
fun. Good for you. So that's a,

1240
01:22:39,961 --> 01:22:43,280
that's a pretty cool message. Very
resilient jeans. Very resilient.

1241
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:47,750
Well, someone else told me this.
A Mommy's long time, long time.

1242
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,530
First Time I was listening to a podcast,

1243
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:54,270
three 71 when a listener wrote in saying
their dad picks up an Asian accent.

1244
01:22:54,271 --> 01:22:57,350
Whenever we're talking to an Asian
person, this is my favorite thing. Well,

1245
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:01,110
this seems to be an epidemic as deeply
ingrained and dads as dad mouth is.

1246
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:06,310
My father does the exact same thing from
the unintentional horrifically racist

1247
01:23:06,311 --> 01:23:10,420
accent to reverting back to a
caveman sentence structure. However,

1248
01:23:10,421 --> 01:23:12,700
my father's dad accident
goes a little further.

1249
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:15,820
Not only does he do the accent of
the person you're speaking with,

1250
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:19,750
but he is in contact with them.
Over the course of maybe an hour,

1251
01:23:20,050 --> 01:23:21,610
he starts to switch up accents,

1252
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:25,660
even throwing in words from different
languages and it's, for example,

1253
01:23:25,661 --> 01:23:29,560
after an entire meal of him talking to
our waitress and a Sushi restaurant with

1254
01:23:29,561 --> 01:23:33,490
an Asian data accent. For some reason
over the course of a few sentences,

1255
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:37,410
it morphed into a Hispanic accent,
even ending the night with Eh,

1256
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:42,450
with him saying see and respond to the
waitress question of whether or not he

1257
01:23:42,941 --> 01:23:45,300
was finished with his
plate. Oh my God. Oh my God.

1258
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:50,430
My father is neither Hispanic nor Asian
and has not had any extended periods

1259
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,310
with anyone.
Um,

1260
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:56,710
he would not have a familiar familiarity
preference like a was suggested by the

1261
01:23:56,711 --> 01:23:57,311
main mommy.

1262
01:23:57,311 --> 01:24:01,540
I think this matter needs further
investigation to get the source of data

1263
01:24:01,541 --> 01:24:06,220
accents, keeping them high and tight
Blake be wow. That is just remarkable.

1264
01:24:06,221 --> 01:24:10,210
I mean, I have so many countless
memories of my dad doing that.

1265
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:13,700
Juan Nieto, did you have, did you,

1266
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:16,930
would you able to buy some Nice
space today? He's good. No.

1267
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:21,760
See why aren't you telling you like that,
that, and maybe this weekend we, uh,

1268
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:25,840
should I show you some of the
things in the church is nice here.

1269
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:30,060
You would like it and they were
like, okay, boom, boom, boom.

1270
01:24:31,190 --> 01:24:35,900
And it was like Jess,
Jess, so ridiculous. Um,

1271
01:24:37,690 --> 01:24:41,890
Miss. Say, uh, Oh yeah. Oh, by the way,

1272
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:46,990
do you remember the, um,
master of accents last episode?

1273
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:51,130
Um, which clearly we, you
know the fatty play? Yeah. No,

1274
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:55,870
the also the other guy. What was
the, uh, um, the redneck. Oh, right.

1275
01:24:55,871 --> 01:24:59,380
Yeah. From Louisiana. That's right.

1276
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:03,940
Somebody gave us a,
someone to give us the old one too.

1277
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,390
Huh? So what? Four. Hi y'all.

1278
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:11,190
I'm old man. Hey, I ran
five. You out balloons.

1279
01:25:12,270 --> 01:25:16,060
I got hope of will fold eight
wellness pick up fro. Oh, well

1280
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:20,450
scare. Looks good, right? He
looks awesome. It's chin. Looks

1281
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:24,510
Golf. I'm, I ain't go with state
prison here. Had a facial or bad at,

1282
01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:27,080
I'm wondering how paring it
back and forth out the failure

1283
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:32,200
makes a lot of sense.
We said he was hauling printers.

1284
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:36,980
It's hauling prisoners back and
forth. Oh, Angola state prison.

1285
01:25:36,990 --> 01:25:40,360
All right. That wouldn't make sense.
Yeah. Instead of printers. Yeah.

1286
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:41,880
Cringe.

1287
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:46,880
I had [inaudible] go [inaudible] have
to look it in tanker and then thank you.

1288
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:54,370
Thank run and thanking. Yeah,
but now we know that, uh,

1289
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:57,700
there's no printers that they
need and goal this state prison.

1290
01:25:58,690 --> 01:26:03,220
What a dumb fucking, well, yeah. Listen
in your defense as a master of accents,

1291
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:04,063
I think that

1292
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:07,260
your batting average is pretty
high. It's pretty, it's pretty easy.

1293
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:11,690
It's substantial. That one word off. I
mean, you translated all that hillbilly.

1294
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:16,700
I know, I know you hear this
dog. Of course. Of course I do.

1295
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:19,520
Hey guys,
I don't have a man of video in a while,

1296
01:26:19,521 --> 01:26:23,420
but I'm gonna make up to make it up to
you because this year I've had held the

1297
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:24,500

1298
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:29,620
super purpose where I worthwhile and a
lot of air six down to my stomach and

1299
01:26:29,621 --> 01:26:32,390
then I saw and more air because it makes
her up and said, I'm just burping it.

1300
01:26:32,391 --> 01:26:36,920
Write it up right away. So give
me a little bit, be patient.

1301
01:26:37,190 --> 01:26:39,710
I'm going to have to
swallow amount of air. Okay.

1302
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:43,990
I like how all of those are like, hey
guys. Like it's always like, hey guys,

People who are dany acts.
Yeah, the Dany actors or crew.

1305
01:26:52,970 --> 01:26:56,480
It's always super upbeat. Hey guys.
So today on this makeup tutorial,

1306
01:26:56,481 --> 01:27:00,930
I'm going to show you how everybody
opens their view. Youtube is. Hi Guys.

1307
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:06,350
I just want to talk to you.
Uh, hey guys. Hey guys.

1308
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:09,410
Hey guys.
It's me,

1309
01:27:09,411 --> 01:27:13,060
Haley and I just on a target run and
I wanted to show you everything I buy.

1310
01:27:13,490 --> 01:27:16,070
I got some little candle guys.

1311
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:20,490
I'm going to show you what I got.
There was some great emails.

1312
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:25,010
Remember the Yankee Candle Guy and he
would do candle runs and then he would,

1313
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,830
he would review the Yankee
candles. I like, I actually liked,

1314
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:30,530
I really liked those
good smelling candles.

1315
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:34,790
It was just like unbelievable that that
was somebody's whole plight, you know?

1316
01:27:35,090 --> 01:27:37,190
That was the whole thing.
Yeah.

1317
01:27:37,191 --> 01:27:42,060
That's everything that they do in
their life. It's just that, oh,

1318
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:47,090
I just did a target round, but
there's no power. Like who's watching?

1319
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:52,700
Who is watching that maybe got to only
be somebody who's also doing the exact

1320
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:56,900
same thing. Right? Like teeny
boppers. Yeah. Well, teenage girls.

1321
01:27:57,290 --> 01:28:01,340
Well I think just know that other like
just sad shopper. Is that all right?

1322
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:04,880
What'd you get? Oh, I
got something to wet,

1323
01:28:04,881 --> 01:28:08,260

yeah, let's, let's pull it up. Okay.

1324
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:10,660
I'm really painful too,
so

1325
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:14,560
yeah, that's right.

1326
01:28:16,170 --> 01:28:19,380
I don't know if I can watch it.
I didn't like,

1327
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:26,700
wow.

1328
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:31,460
You should see how that red
on the fucking Holy Shit.

1329
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:35,520
That was disgusting. Even
I'm like, I'm disgusted.

1330
01:28:35,521 --> 01:28:39,050
It grows rarely rice.
Jesus.

1331
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:42,730
I can't hear it. It makes it sounds
like Aaron, one day. I don't like it.

1332
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:46,100
Hmm. I don't like it. I
like it. I don't like that.

1333
01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:50,790
All right.

1334
01:28:54,050 --> 01:28:58,770
Aww. That's so gnarly. You know how many
come? Where's the, where's the Pey Info?

1335
01:28:58,870 --> 01:29:02,700
I mean, why isn't she
like, guys, hello guys,

1336
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,470
you need to pay for this video.

1337
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:08,260
I don't like it.
Yeah.

1338
01:29:13,370 --> 01:29:17,630
Do you know how many complaints we're
going to get from people for this episode?

1339
01:29:18,570 --> 01:29:23,540
Here? Buds listen to that. And it
was a lot of cards. A lot of burbs,

1340
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:27,920
Brown talk. There's a lot today, but
that one in particular was so loud.

1341
01:29:27,950 --> 01:29:31,210
Fucking gnarly. Blew up the
levels there. The chicken,

1342
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:36,410
this is the, hey guys,
whisper born. Oh God.

1343
01:29:36,510 --> 01:29:37,343
This shit

1344
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:52,590
as it given me so much anxiety.
It's making me so angry.

1345
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:04,640
It's so gross. I can hear it.

1346
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:07,890
The saliva on her. My, I don't like
that. Well, if somebody stealing,

1347
01:30:09,030 --> 01:30:11,580
I really hate this.
I really don't like this.

1348
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:16,380
I'd rather watch the bug.
That's somebody's favorite thing.

1349
01:30:20,210 --> 01:30:23,670
Okay. Right. Okay.

1350
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:31,383
Okay.

1351
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:33,750
Huh.

1352
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:36,780
I knew a girl in high school
that could do that. Yeah. Yeah.

1353
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:41,430
Her name was Tiffany and she would drink
a Dr pepper in burp like that. Ooh.

1354
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:46,320
I don't like this. This makes me so
fucking angry. All right. Isn't it?

1355
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:51,420
I have no patience for this to you, right.
I mean, I, I'm not into it Tom. Yeah.

1356
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:57,780
Talk to, yeah, I like it.

1357
01:31:03,210 --> 01:31:06,180
I don't mean dumb the show.

1358
01:31:06,980 --> 01:31:07,813
Huh?

1359
01:31:09,410 --> 01:31:13,190
I have come all over my face.
This is our [inaudible].

1360
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:17,540
I have to come all over my face.
So disrespectful.

1361
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:23,440
O f a r t and those are
the best ones of today.

1362
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:28,340
So it's a really good show.
It really was a good show.

1363
01:31:28,430 --> 01:31:32,050
It was really fun. Uh, so we
go out. Should we go out? Yeah.

1364
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:35,120
You got to come back to some patriarchal.
Put that shit down. Put that shit.

1365
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:40,410
That shit down. Yeah, let's do
it. Oh, can I request? Yeah,

1366
01:31:40,430 --> 01:31:43,300
if you have it. Yeah. I was
just thinking today that, yeah,

1367
01:31:44,530 --> 01:31:45,830
mom's house.

1368
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:51,290
You wanna hear that song? Yeah. It's
your mom's house. It's your mom.

1369
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:53,850
And I like that line.
Let's see.

1370
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:58,890
Jeans a and a dead.
Remember how that goes?

1371
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:03,500
Let me see if this is it.
Really listen to this one too,

1372
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:09,940
and we've had some fun.
Yes, he is. I said,

1373
01:32:11,990 --> 01:32:16,510
well, that's it. Go into that. This
is done the dinner. Then the bitch

1374
01:32:18,930 --> 01:32:20,290
