75
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:24,070
Hi. I'll make this brief. My name
is Shannon. Why your shipment?

76
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,070
I'm looking for girls for pussy.
I love to eat pussy.

77
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,993
Okay.

78
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,460
Don't bring anyone loving. Well, welcome.

79
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,000
It looks like he likes
to eat a lot of stuff.

80
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,670
We keep getting these cool
guys that produce videos.

81
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,120
How are they finding this? I don't
know and it's a very unique and whoever

82
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,070
is sending these in, I want to thank
you from the bottom of my heart.

83
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,180
This is exactly what gets me going.
Me Too.

84
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,570
And it meets all the criteria and
Albert. Excellent. Your mom crops, video,

85
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,800
portrait mode, tight. Uh, Y,

86
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,060
y wall background,
ceiling.

87
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,080
What normally happens is they hold that
camera away and you kind of get a little

88
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:25,400
too much, you know, space. He
went the opposite. Too much face.

89
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:28,580
He's holding his phone right here.
He's all face.

90
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,690
It's almost like he's telling you a secret
that he likes pussy. It's disgusting.

91
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:38,120
I don't want him to know that close and
he's got acne and most of these guys

92
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:43,121
need to know that all girls know that
you want Pussy Tommy and they don't want

93
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:47,720
to hear you saying that. They never
want to hear you say that. That's true.

94
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:52,100
It is kind of a given. Yeah, he does.
He's not shocking anybody with this news.

95
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,550
No, no. He's fucking, they all like it.

96
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,690
We all want it. Yeah. Well you
know, or some version of whatever.

97
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,090
He is so damned gross.

98
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,100
If you're in Africa,
you're looking for some action

99
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,260
kind of whisper to you.

100
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,403
Hello?
Talk.

101
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,560

Oh, he gave two different numbers.
Gout. What's with the, why does he call?

104
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,830
I know the whisper talks also. He's on
the drew list, please. Missouri Fat Guy.

105
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,980
Pussy Hound.

106
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:37,060
But then what's the drew list
up to how many we have for him?

107
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,410
Let me find it first. There's gotta be
some new. This is like new stuff for true.

108
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,030
This is, this is fucking not normal. I
don't know where it is. Where did it go?

109
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,070
You're too drew list. Maybe I'm
on the other side. Here it is.

113
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:07,270
that's a nine 10 1111
with the Missouri Fat Guy.

114
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,120
Are you serious things
that he hasn't seen yet?

115
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,160
Fresh material like this show
is grist for the mill of crazy.

116
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,750
Yeah, we've got the mill. Oh my God.
It knows that many. Yeah, of course.

Okay. Yeah. Dr Drew,

vomit of some kind needs you send them

120
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:36,730

teaser of last week and we were like,

121
00:08:36,731 --> 00:08:41,470
this one's for him. And um,

Obviously. It's a fine line.

144
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,510
So they can find them. We
uh, uh, the Meth, that guy
took it video down. Why? Why?

145
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:17,200
Yeah. I wonder why people found
them and they're like, hey man,

146
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:21,940
I want to see that Dick get bigger.
That's the thing about our,

147
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:22,540
uh,

148
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:27,430
listeners is that they are so
good at finding these people.

149
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,270
You can't hide from the Mommy's yes.

150
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:35,290
That they are a harnessed force and
they should never be matched with,

151
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:40,000
you know? Yeah man. Yeah. Quite a force.

152
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,280
Oh my God. I, I don't want to forget.

153
00:10:42,281 --> 00:10:45,690
So that's why I'm jumping into
this right now. What's that? Um,

154
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,150
I did it. I did it. I did it.

155
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:54,390
I went ahead and against your wishes.

156
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,290
Um, hold on. Oh boy.

157
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,480
Against your wishes. No
neuropathy. Now your apathy issues,

158
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,730
he just said,

159
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,470
I'm not sure why that's relevant
to his discussion of what,

160
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:14,950
when his brother comes so hard.
Yeah. With no known neuropathy.

161
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,630
[inaudible] neuropathy hinder his ability
to come rather than bolster it boost

162
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:22,690
his ability to come hard. You know what
I'm saying? Like his argument is, yeah,

163
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,950
there's no known neuropathy that would
be an advantage is what I'm thinking to

164
00:11:26,951 --> 00:11:28,870
his coming so hard.
It's all the math.

165
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,450
So why I mentioned the neuropathy, I
don't know baby smokes meth. I mean,

166
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,380
what are you trying to do here?

167
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,590
I'm just trying to make logical sense
out of the argument. That's your problem.

168
00:11:38,591 --> 00:11:42,640
My problem with crazy is my whole life
I've tried to understand it and I just,

169
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,230
you can't, you can't understand it. You
just gotta let it go. You dared me and,

170
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:51,510
and double dog dared me and
said, it's not possible. Uh,

171
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:55,430
I didn't say that. A, you said it's
not a good idea. It's not possible.

172
00:11:55,431 --> 00:12:00,340
And I went and pulled the trigger anyway.
Oh boy. It's the four stroking tee shirt

173
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,763
from,

174
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,830
I'll see you at your mom's house. Oh
boy. We went with the approach of,

175
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,480
uh,
having a golf clubs.

176
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:15,860
A lot of people were telling me, oh,
motorcycles have four stroke engines,

177
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:19,640
but I have no one. No, I
wouldn't know that. Well, the,
I just was just like, yeah,

178
00:12:19,641 --> 00:12:20,474
I don't,

179
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,690
so it says your mom's house for
stroke gang, don't math with us,

180
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,550
which is pretty funny.
I like the tag.

181
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,550
Yeah, it's pretty great.
I'm trying to find a,

182
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:33,820
I want to find the gentleman
that designed it for us. Uh,

183
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,300
to me it's Jeffrey Miles. Jeffrey
Jeffrey. Thank you very much. Uh,

184
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,940
says your mom's house. And then on that
bottom part it says, don't mess with us.

185
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:47,020
Which was a suggestion from somebody for
stroke gang. So it's in the store. Um,

186
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,680
I'm going to be selling
about five or seven of these.

187
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:54,610
Let's show Christina what time it is
and prove to her that for stroke gang it

188
00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:56,760
can be for the masses.

189
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:01,940
My prediction [inaudible]
Lotta Xcels not at all.

190
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,820
Not a lot of uh, female cuts being
sold. I can go and mail only on this.

191
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,830
I think the,
okay,

192
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,750
when that's a smart idea because you're
not going to see a lot of females,

193
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,160
female side necessarily.

194
00:13:17,161 --> 00:13:21,360
Trolls mediums are going to seem larger
sizes being so like you're full of it.

195
00:13:21,361 --> 00:13:23,610
But yeah. Um, I would be,

196
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,650
I would be so surprised if I saw a woman
out of your mom's house event or one of

197
00:13:28,651 --> 00:13:32,160
our standup shows wearing this.
I would not be surprised.

198
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,710
This is the difference between
you and me. Okay. Well I believe,

199
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:39,780
I'd like to get some numbers on these
because this is the rub rub shirt and no

200
00:13:39,781 --> 00:13:42,400
offense to the designer because he
tweeted me and he was like, I'm,

201
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,560
I can't believe you. Yeah, that was funny.
I was joking. But the design is fine.

202
00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:49,210
I'm not saying anything. I just
think the concept, the idea of your,

203
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,930
of a com beard on a comedian's face,

204
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:55,230
it's a little aggressive and I'm thinking
four strokes till someone comes hard

205
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,130
again. A little aggressive.
And they did the play on,
they put golf clubs there. Oh,

206
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:03,180
I got it. No, I understand the joke.
It's very clever. But uh, you know,

207
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:05,310
what does it mean? It's about, well now

208
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,850
like an inside thing where like
somebody who just walks by,

209
00:14:08,851 --> 00:14:12,960
someone in that shirt, it's like, Oh
God, I got it. A golf thing, you know?

210
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:17,380
Yeah. You're laughing at my reaction.
You know what's great about it?

211
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:22,610
It happens every, every episode and you
get mad every time. I know. It's terrible.

212
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,470
It's so funny.

213
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,570
You're like Charlie Brown when he goes
to kick the ball and then Lucy takes it

214
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:32,660
away. No. And he's like, why
did I keep trying anyways? Um,

215
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,350
disgusting,
vile

216
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:40,420
bye. Sees it. And they go, oh, that's
a golf friend. But then if it's a,

217
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:44,530
somebody that's in the know,
they know that it's a meth smoking,

218
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,620
that's a meth pipe right
under the golf clubs.

219
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,480
Yeah. But meant to look like a, a t with
a ball kind of upside down, you know?

220
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,530
Yeah.

221
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:58,060
You know me really funny because
doesn't Your Dad Golf? Yeah.

222
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,370
Maybe we could get him a shirt.
Oh, I'll definitely send them one.

223
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:05,980
You buddy at a golf shirt.
What's this for? Stroking cow.

224
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,720
So at four strokes would
imply we gotta get it.

225
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,570
I'm on the show soon.
He, uh, he's on a trip,

226
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,430
right? Four strokes would imply that you
can get the ball in the hole and four,

227
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,580
well it would, well, I mean it would

228
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,660
just, it doesn't necessarily
suggest that it's just, you know,

229
00:15:21,661 --> 00:15:25,220
a stroke is, uh, you
know, a swing of it. Um,

230
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,690
three strokes for strokes.

231
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:30,990
So I think it would just suggest to
a golf person that it's just, yeah.

232
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,650
Golf Lingo. You want me super funny
is if golf nerds did buy it. No,

233
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,400
I had no idea. Like, he's so
funny. He, to the driving range,

234
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,970
Dad boners wearing it.

235
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:45,770
What's the forest stroke that you and
your friends you go play golf? Uh,

236
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,130
yeah. Well, uh,

237
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,530
have fun selling those five
shirts and view so wrong on this.

238
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,980
Let's see what mentally ill women
you know are into that kind of stuff.

239
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,873
I'm telling you,

240
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,720
it's in the store now. March method,
merchant method.com. So slash Tom Segura.

241
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,790
Um, we did our, uh, so grow, we
did an overnight to get away.

242
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,470
Yeah. For one night. What we do is, uh,

243
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,830
we take her some and put them in the
dog crate, put a bowl, some waters,

244
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,970
fresh water,
don't get upset.

245
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:19,680
We leave him diapers were like change
yourself and then, sure. Uh, we, uh,

246
00:16:19,681 --> 00:16:23,040
we just leave him for like a day again.
Please say that you're joking.

247
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:26,700
So the child services doesn't
come investigate. Kidding.
It's less than a day.

248
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,080
We did them for like 18 hours.
Okay. Um, no, we have a,

249
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,880
he's watched. Don't worry about it. No.
Yeah, well it, the cigarettes and his,

250
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,410
his booze and then we go overnight.

251
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,110
It's just what something we
do every once in a while.

252
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,250
And we went to a nice place. We
spent the night out, but, uh,

253
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,300
first we went to their spa and did
like nice mommy treatment at the spa.

254
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,740
And, um, beforehand,
before we left the house,

255
00:16:55,741 --> 00:17:00,570
actually it was like mid day you
had ordered a Mediterranean lunch.

256
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:05,430
Yeah. And you were like trial this stuff.
And I go, okay. And it was really good.

257
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,960
It was it an Israeli or is it yeah,

258
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,060
Sydney. Yeah. Yeah, Mediterranean Diet.

259
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:12,720
I was reading how healthy it is and I'm
really into sour tastes right now being

260
00:17:12,721 --> 00:17:14,310
preggers. Yeah. So, you know,

261
00:17:14,311 --> 00:17:19,311
it's like a fucking Hamas and
chicken kebabs and stuff like that.

262
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,550
I had, you know, had had breakfast
and I was, I was like, yeah,

263
00:17:21,551 --> 00:17:24,060
but I'll try these and I've took
a couple of bites of things,

264
00:17:24,061 --> 00:17:27,930
really fresh egg plant that
fresh salads and mix, right.

265
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:31,230
Diced tomatoes, all fresh.
Very good. Really good.

266
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:36,150
And then of course like a homemade fresh
hummus. Hamas, I think he's homeless.

267
00:17:36,151 --> 00:17:37,610
Yeah, I, I

268
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,770
had that homos and um,

269
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,460
if you bites then a few
more or less really good.

270
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:48,650
And we drive to the place and um,
we check in together.

271
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,160
I go in my room,

272
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,020
I lay on this table and a
therapist comes in and was like,

273
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,460
okay here, you know, whatever,
like relax, have a nice treatment.

274
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,360
And then as she like changes
the light in the room,

275
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,370
my stomach goes through.
Oh, I was like, oh my God.

276
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,100
And like, you know when
you, I could feel it.

277
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,650
The feeling from my gut to my asshole,

278
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:18,810
I'm looking through that donut that your
face is in and I, my eyes widened. I go,

279
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,470
oh my God,

280
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:24,170
it's a catch it quick and I
just squeeze my cheeks so hot.

281
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:29,750
I spent the first 15 minutes just like
this and that donut like in a full panic.

282
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,260
And then eventually it just
went back up inside me.

283
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,380
It's interesting cause
I had a panic fart too,

284
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:41,590
cause that Mediterranean
food really creates a lot of
gas and I just client just

285
00:18:41,591 --> 00:18:46,290
hard as I can, which is very hard for
me. Um, but then it just disappeared.

286
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,150
Yeah.

287
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:51,960
Now here's the nice part is that the
minute you stand up after the massage,

288
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,770
it all comes out. Oh it is. Here's
the thing, and you forgot about it.

289
00:18:55,771 --> 00:19:00,540
That's what happened. You know, it's
like a 90 minute treatment massage.

290
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,320
So when, uh, when you're, when
it's like, okay, it's done.

291
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,700
You kind of have that drunk post
massage feeling where you're like, whoa.

292
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,910
And she was like, oh, they're
waiting outside with water,

293
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,050
their water. And I sit up
and you're like, Oh man,

294
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,280
you sit on the table for a second,
kind of gather yourself,

295
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,240
put your robe on. Like, oh man.

296
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:29,310
And then asthma about to walk out.
I go, Huh, I got the fart again.

297
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,470
And now you feel no pressure, no fear.
And it's just, it's like it built,

298
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,410
it grows, it grows and then
it comes out so fast. Yeah.

299
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,620
And so effortlessly,
but also with more substance and purpose

300
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:50,250
has really some meaning behind it.
You can't stop it if you want it to.

301
00:19:50,251 --> 00:19:53,610
At that point, it was like a
second massage has to happen.

302
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,560
Now what's really neat is where I was
climbing up some stairs with you to go

303
00:19:58,561 --> 00:20:02,610
back to our room and there
was a gaggle of young girls,

304
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,710
little 1213 year old tea.
We're not 12, 13? No. Uh,

305
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:10,890
how old are those slots? No,
like 17, 18, 19 like, yeah,

306
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:15,740
they're older tables sluts. Okay. Yeah,
they were total slots. Now they look,

307
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,300
they look tiny.
Everyone looks so young to me now.

308
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:22,860
They're not 12th night and they were
walking. I climb steps slowly now.

309
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:27,810
So they're like all kind of going
past and I let out the biggest fart.

310
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,870
Believe it. Here's
what's interesting. Okay.

311
00:20:30,871 --> 00:20:35,760
Here's why I wrote it down for
topic today because if you recall,

312
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:41,060
the Cincinnati fart happened when I was
six months pregnant and Cincinnati and

313
00:20:41,691 --> 00:20:44,760
that, what room do we, six one
eight or eight oh eight. Yeah.

314
00:20:44,761 --> 00:20:48,190
We couldn't figure it
out. And, and it came to,

315
00:20:48,191 --> 00:20:53,140
it came to my attention that pregnancy
farts for me are more powerful.

316
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,630
They smell exactly like what I
have just eaten. I, um, the day

317
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,520
I had some Broccoli and Le and beef
stew, I farted, like an hour later,

318
00:21:06,521 --> 00:21:11,070
it's smelled exactly like the beef stew
in the Broccoli. He was so crazy intense.

319
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,390
And so I allowed that tremendous for
it on the stairs. And I was like,

320
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:20,500
this is one of the nice things
about being pregnant is the volume,

321
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:21,520
the ferocity,

322
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:26,521
the years probably people that had really
heard and seen you do that would have

323
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:31,480
been that poor woman. You get
so much empathy as a, you know,

324
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,760
you think they take mercy on us.
Oh definitely.

325
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:38,470
Like I had done in the
pig that had been like,

326
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,280
oh that that nicely. They have no
idea what a savage you are no idea.

327
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,810
That's the best part about being
a lady is that nobody knows it's,

328
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,780
it's my secret,
our secret

329
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:54,610
and have a rnt and no that was great.

330
00:21:54,611 --> 00:21:58,780
And then here's the other thing that
we might, God we're at a nice place,

331
00:21:58,781 --> 00:22:02,350
you know, it's our one night out
for like, I dunno the month or two,

332
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:04,090
we never go out to dinner anymore.

333
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,480
Like we're in bed by
eight o'clock watching TV.

334
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:11,190
Like the dinner doesn't happen. So make
a reservation at a nice restaurant.

335
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,410
Really Nice restaurant and we eat it fine.
We look at the menu and we're like,

336
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:18,550
it's going to be a great meal. And then
especially because you're pregnant,

337
00:22:18,551 --> 00:22:22,090
cause I actually, I follow the lead
a lot. Like I try to be a good boy,

338
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:27,091
but if there's a pregnant woman eating
and saying I can only resist so much.

339
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,070
And so it's like there's a
few hours and you're like,

340
00:22:30,071 --> 00:22:34,660
well I got to eat something. Like I need
a snack. I could, we had a good two,

341
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,600
two hours and 45 minutes before a
dinner reservation at this point.

342
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,290
Here's the thing,

343
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:42,700
we usually dinner like at five with our
kid and our dinner reservation was for

344
00:22:42,701 --> 00:22:46,810
seven 45 which is for me,
that's pajamas at bedtime.

345
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:51,110
So five you're like, you're like, oh I got
to wait almost three hours. You got to,

346
00:22:51,111 --> 00:22:54,520
got to order something.
So we pull up the room,

347
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,800
the in room dining menu. Yeah.
And we, you start ordering

348
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:06,790
beet salad, cheese, careless smarties.
And then what was the other thing?

349
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,050
Oh the chips and Guac.

350
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,100
That's always the nail and the confidence
that that was bad. I mean it was good.

351
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:17,220
But anyways, they bring it up and
then it starts picking up cookies too.

352
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,190
Yeah. Oh No, they brought a
whole thing of different cookies.

353
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:26,470
What the fuck is this? Oh, just welcomes.
It's just a gift from the staff.

354
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:29,610
Oh my God. Yeah. I just, I dunno,

355
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,410
all of a sudden I'm looking at you.
I'm like,

356
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,590
supposed to have dinner in an
hour and you're like, yeah, oh,

357
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:43,250
I think we're going to skip appetizers.
I'm like, yeah. I think, yeah.

358
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,960
I ended up being a great meal
that we only ate even when I,

359
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,000
when I ordered dinner, the guy was like,
he sides. I was like, nope. He's like,

360
00:23:53,001 --> 00:23:56,840
it's not that big of go. It's
fine. I'd never do that. I
was like, no, no. It's good.

361
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:00,950
We're such 80th and that's such a nice
place. And we never really go out tonight.

362
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:05,720
We don't go to a nice places anymore
and like, we totally blew it, dude.

363
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:09,950
We blew it on Calamari and chips
and salsa and the chips in gloss.

364
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:13,100
So it was a fun night though. Super
Fun. Yeah, but I was like, dude,

365
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:19,250
you take it for at, Huh? Oh yeah, of
course. What did you drink? I drank.

366
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:24,230
Um, oh. I tried one of their signature
cocktails. I didn't even know that.

367
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:25,810
Yeah. And then, uh,

368
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:30,190
I had a glass of wine
after that crazy rep brows.

369
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:34,970
I'd be carried back to
the room. Sure, sure.

370
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,780
Well, you know what's so funny to you
and I are, this is why we're married,

371
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,650
been together for so long is that
we both liked the same things,

372
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:45,790
which is laying down and then eating.
Yeah.

373
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:50,960
Well it makes for a good relationship
watching stuff. Farming land,

374
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:54,530
the end of the same stuff, man.
Patten dogs. You know what I mean?

375
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,460
This is something I want you
to think about since, um,

376
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,840
we're going to have another baby soon.

377
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,420
Also,
I'm making use today a bit of a stink.

378
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:09,450
I've a baby nappies asexuality expert
claims parents must ask permission before

379
00:25:11,141 --> 00:25:13,270
changing their child's nappy.

380
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,650
Yeah. It's a foreign or word for it. So

381
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,340
it's the idea that we should ask
this child to be about for consent

382
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,220
to change. Yeah. In Carlson blades,

383
00:25:30,221 --> 00:25:33,940
consent must be given by the child
before they dirty nappies removed.

384
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:37,360
He or she is on the ABC
suggesting how to go about it.

385
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,910
I'm going to change a nappy now.
Is that okay?

386
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,640
Of course the baby is not going to
respond. Yes, mom. That's awesome.

387
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,140
I'd love to have my nappy changed,

388
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:49,740
but if you leave a space and wait for
body language and ways to make eye

389
00:25:50,561 --> 00:25:51,221
contact,

390
00:25:51,221 --> 00:25:56,221
then you're letting that child know that
their response matters and live in Glen

391
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,240
in that child run away
from the change table,

392
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:03,380
right? That's right. That's right.
I was going to say shit on it.

393
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,640
It's such, what's going on? It's
worth shit. What the fuck is it?

394
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,990
You know what's wrong is that people
don't think there's objective reality

395
00:26:11,991 --> 00:26:14,480
anymore. Everybody's living
in their own version of it,

396
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,860
and so whatever you say is right,
it doesn't matter.

397
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,120
There's no objective shit happening.
The thing is,

398
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,980
this woman had it right on the head.

399
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:26,981
You ever try to change a diaper on a
screaming infant who's wet and miserable?

400
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:32,470
Never give consent one out of half the
time when a kid can't even respond,

401
00:26:34,641 --> 00:26:37,820
but they're usually like, no, no, and
you're like, you have shit on you.

402
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:43,490
Well this morning. Yeah.
It takes 10 minutes just to
wrangle the toddler and uh,

403
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,970
to convince him to stop playing for
five seconds. Yes. It's, it's a,

404
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:51,870
it's a fucking nightmare,
man. And an infant, someone
who can't even really talk,

405
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:55,810
respond. Oh my God. That is the dumbest
thing I've ever fucking heard. Fuck.

406
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,050
An eight week old.
Is it okay with you?

407
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,760
This dumb bitch and I have never had
a kid in her life. [inaudible] stupid.

408
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:07,710
Basically. It's caused quite a stir.
Some slam. His concept is left lunacy.

409
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:11,730
Yes. Carson has definitive comments
saying the idea around consent is about

410
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,620
empowering children with their rights
and protecting them from sexual abuse.

411
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,440
Oh, okay. Well here's the
thing. You just tell the kid,

412
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:24,300
mommy and daddy change your your day
day. Yeah. And it, you know, nobody else.

413
00:27:24,301 --> 00:27:26,760
That's it.
Or if someone touches your eat,

414
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,190
why can't you just have a conversation
with your kids is what I'm saying?

415
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:32,880
Because what you're talking about like
stupid idiot kids that can't speak though.

416
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,510
She's talking about babies.
I've got a seat.

417
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:41,100
Same month old. You do two photo.
It's cool. Cool. It's cool.

418
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,850
Yeah. She can see her point. Oh, okay,

419
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,810
well monitor. It'll go po
says no. It was a single time.

420
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,000
You're not respecting
her consent. Oh, I know.

421
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:59,910
I liked these. Yeah, yeah, of course.
These keeper. Real man. Yeah. Um,

422
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,330
all I know. Yeah. You're
not respecting her consent.

423
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,120
Change that baby's nappy.

424
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,370
Well then I guess diaper changing is a
sexual event. Is that what they're saying?

425
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,920
I don't know. I'm going to change a nappy
now. He said, okay. Is that it? Okay.

426
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:20,900
I mean, you're not touch, you know what I
mean? It's not a sexual, I understand the,

427
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,210
the,
the kind of the logic of like,

428
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:27,780
can I pull your pants down essentially
and do the, you know, wipe you up.

429
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:32,370
But you know what, this is a, it
is, is it's madness. Yes. It's,

430
00:28:32,371 --> 00:28:37,350
it's absolutely madness that you would
think to ask a baby for consent to,

431
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:40,500
I mean, the fact that we're even
having this conversation. Yeah.

432
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:44,700
Well I'll tell you what else is
insanity. Uh, remember that gender,

433
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,260
was it Holland?

434
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:51,210
And she was asking the two year old what
gender the two year old felt that day.

435
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,360
And it's like the kid doesn't even
understand the fucking question.

436
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,830
Do you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

437
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,980
And it's like they don't know how
to even think in that way yet. No,

438
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,370
it's not even that's not happening.
Uh,

439
00:29:02,371 --> 00:29:06,180
I'll tell you who's not into
giving consent for everything.

440
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:09,510
Couple a number of the things they do.
Let me show you this gentleman

441
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,450
after one of his fights in
prison have to be the guy so bad.

442
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:18,690
I took a blue no sane and just
feeling this in no what I'm saying.

443
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,673
Nothing.

444
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:27,300
And it went from there, man.
Yeah, it went from no sure.

445
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,580
Became well known.

446
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:34,140
I would like a live in laser
does a respect everybody on this.

447
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:37,490
Everybody do you know about
me or disrespect of as Dasa,

448
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,790
you know what I'm saying?
And get crazy.

449
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:44,100
So he's got his own alter
ego. Good for him. I mean, I,

450
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,200
I can't say I wouldn't try to
do the same in prison. Well,

451
00:29:47,201 --> 00:29:50,140
why don't you hear a little bit
more about what dark side does.

452
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,250
Kelly says when others crossing
you will not only hurt them,

453
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,480
humiliate them as well. We warn
you, it's description is disturbing.

454
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:01,700
I told you SPEC. You know what I'm saying?
I told this, I might put more food.

455
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:06,500
It took me to put a wound or saying
I'll take me.

456
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:11,330
You know what I'm saying? You know what
I'm saying? Everybody don't mess with me.

457
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:15,500
No reason why by lead them after I
get in physical contact with them,

458
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:20,400
I learned an improvement from a 25 year
vision. I seen an old car and beat,

459
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,580
you know when he knocked the gap?
No Sin.

460
00:30:22,581 --> 00:30:25,170
He took a finger stuck in the Buddha
Hall. No what I'm saying. And they did it.

461
00:30:25,171 --> 00:30:26,090
So when that man crazy,

462
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,460
the Megan was sticking a finger
Buddha holes and we going to kill him.

463
00:30:28,461 --> 00:30:32,830
Leave him alone. No. Beethoven.
I alert. Yes. I learned from

464
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,020
it. Makes Sense. It does make sense.
It's scary as shit though, right? Yeah.

465
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,260
I mean that this guy is terrifying, but
that's why he, that's his signature move.

466
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:44,350
Yeah. He's telling you, I'm uh,
I'm uh, if you fuck with me,

467
00:30:44,351 --> 00:30:47,440
I'm going to put my finger in your butt.
I'm going to put my finger up your butt.

468
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:50,980
If you fuck with me. He's the
backside guy. Oh, he's smart.

469
00:30:50,981 --> 00:30:53,920
He knows what he's doing. It's called
marketing. It's called branding.

470
00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:58,420
Tom Get on board. I don't know,
man. It's um, that's intense.

471
00:30:58,421 --> 00:31:02,710
So nobody's talked to them. No, no fucks
with him. And they, you, you realize that.

472
00:31:02,711 --> 00:31:06,850
You probably get the warning when you
get that he's, he gets, he's like,

473
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,910
yeah. Hey Man. And then he, if you're new,

474
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:13,030
you ask them about you like that to
show me his finger. Was that all about,

475
00:31:13,031 --> 00:31:17,380
I'm like, well, the dark side
and he's got a real dark side.

476
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:20,710
He will, a dork set. He'll knock you out.

477
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,110
They help put his finger up your ass.

478
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,850
Just be aware of the thumb.
If you get on his bad side.

479
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:32,010
He just crazy Yulia Salada you name it.
Don't matter what you do.

480
00:31:32,011 --> 00:31:34,920
Are you going to get you
love it?

481
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,330
Yeah. I mean, look, you got a credit,

482
00:31:41,331 --> 00:31:45,110
this guy for some creativity here.
He's got a great hook.

483
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,090
He's got a great way of
protecting himself. Yeah. I
mean, he's kind of brilliant.

484
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:52,070
I think this is brilliant, really. Dude,

485
00:31:52,071 --> 00:31:55,170
if you are in prison with all
these fucking hard dudes. Yeah.

486
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,710
And you got them all afraid of you because
you're going to shove your finger and

487
00:31:57,711 --> 00:31:59,780
you're in their butts.
Yeah. It's brilliant.

488
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,680
I feel like he would just be giving his
idea to all these other guys though.

489
00:32:03,681 --> 00:32:06,620
I mean, no, what's the stop? The
other guy should be like, oh,

490
00:32:06,621 --> 00:32:08,440
that's what I'm going to do to,
you know.

491
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:11,700
So they're both trying to put their
fingers in each other's exactly.

492
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:15,530
You're fighting. Yeah, exactly.

493
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:18,980
You can't take another inmate's
calling card. That's not cool.

494
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,180
I mean what's going to stop you?
You're a convict. You're uh, you know,

495
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:26,610
remember this, this is also a prison
guy. I gave him to Greece. Yeah.

496
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,010
That guy's terrible.
I tell him now this one,

497
00:32:30,011 --> 00:32:33,740
I'm on his finger sticking in his
eighties and you know what I'm saying?

498
00:32:33,741 --> 00:32:35,600
Kind of like fuck yourself.
Yeah.

499
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:39,560
That's even scarier though
to tell somebody to put their
finger in their own. Oh,

500
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:41,680
this one's, that one's
super menacing. Yeah.

501
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:46,400
Cause you know it's leading
to a Fox. Yeah. Yeah.

502
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,860
All right. Yeah. Yeah. Cause he's like,

503
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:51,080
you got to lubricate yourself
so I don't get in trouble.

504
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,250
Wasn't that the reasoning?

505
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,820
Imagine like likes to fuck his seal.

506
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:01,640
That's a motto is fine. It is a is,
you know what I'm fucking saying?

507
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,550
Yeah. Well this guy, it's
just a finger in the stank.

508
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:08,310
He done it when you're knocked out.
Yeah. So it's fine. Like there's no fire.

509
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:11,210
What are you talking about? You're
knocked out. You're not gonna feel it.

510
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:16,220
You'll feel it afterwards. It's
just a finger gently. Well,

511
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:19,670
it's a thumb on a, you know, you're
already unconscious. So what?

512
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:26,460
Saying no. Saying Salsa.

513
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,223
Salsa.
Wow.

514
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,530
Got It. He's got it. He's
got the right idea. This guy,

515
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,990
you're a fan of dark side.
Hey man,

516
00:33:33,991 --> 00:33:37,530
if I were in prison and if I were smart
enough to come up with a hook like that.

517
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:41,350
Yeah. Yeah. I mean this guy's
a genius. A genius. Dark sizes.

518
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,413
Thanks.

519
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,193
Okay.

520
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,750
Flavor fleet.
Yup.

521
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:52,350
No, say no. Say No. Say

522
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,730
No. Say No. No.

523
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,410
It's been a while since we've
had a montage. Super Cut.
You know what I'm saying?

524
00:34:04,411 --> 00:34:04,930
Like that.

525
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:08,370
Yeah. That was pretty great.
Thanks. Dark sighting. God,

526
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:11,690
that would be the worst guy
to see on the yard. Oh my God.

527
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,410
Best if your cell mate with
someone like that? Nope.

528
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,960
I don't think he has a cellmate.
No, I don't think so either.

529
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:20,970
I think they know better than that.
I think they may have had a cellmate prim.

530
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,380
Remember that one? There was that one
on one. You turn me up a little bit.

531
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:28,300
There was that one. I might
have owned a lockup guy who, uh,

532
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,190
he had a crazy thank you.
It was a Kentucky one. Yeah,

533
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:36,230
we had a crazy mullet and remember he was,

534
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,990
he had a really scary stare.
Yeah.

535
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:45,570
And he told a story about how he had
a cellmate and he didn't like him.

536
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:49,990
Yeah. So he told the
warden or the guards, like,

537
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,330
I don't want to be soul
mates with this guy anymore.

538
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:55,960
Like get him out of here and there you
go. Like, you don't get to decide that.

539
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:00,030
So he just killed him. He goes, guess
what? I'll have some in the morning.

540
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,360
I just decided. Yeah,
that's terrifying. Yeah.

541
00:35:04,361 --> 00:35:09,010
Some of these dudes are pretty wild.
Gosh. Oh, that's why they're locked up.

542
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:13,840
Yeah. Um, what is this? I
haven't seen this. There's
someone said they discovered a,

543
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,850
what is this I want to share
with you? Oh, and guests.

544
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:21,180
Donia that's really close to where I
went to college. North Carolina. Hmm.

545
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,680
This is a poop pile in the neighborhood.
Oh, okay. Okay. Let's see how, let's see.

546
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,330
Well, your work in Gastonia,
North Carolina, and uh,

547
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:36,480
I know Christine's had all
these stats about poop pile,

548
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:40,890
not and not being a common thing
around here. But, uh, this is the local

549
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,260
poop out here. No. Yes. Stoney wow.

550
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,930
Trees right above us.
You can see it's flour.

551
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:55,980
This is what we do around here.
Tupac man.

552
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:02,080
Thank you. Edwin. Let's tar heel.
State mastery is hell Edwin. But again,

553
00:36:02,081 --> 00:36:06,130
I'm not seeing the design that
you describe where it put people,

554
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:10,480
put steps on the ladder and then there's
it. I had a little more ingenuity,

555
00:36:10,481 --> 00:36:14,290
so I mean, that just looks like
a bunch of sticks and some turds.

556
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,450
Let's switch gears for a second. Uh,
thank you Edwin for filming that. Um,

557
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,510
a lot of people were excited last week.
Uh,

558
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:28,560
by my tried out video and it ended up
leaving to a real examination of one bit

559
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,470
of dialogue. Yes. Uh, this is big.

560
00:36:35,471 --> 00:36:39,430
Your mom's house news hot debate.
We have been examining this.

561
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:45,090
Then I made note of the ridiculous amount
of different versions of things people

562
00:36:46,601 --> 00:36:51,600
are hearing. They're really, there really
are a lot. Really? Yeah, I wrote that.

563
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:54,130
Okay. Oh yeah, yeah. Let's hear
it. Well first I guess let's,

564
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:57,940
let's replay the audio so of course
it can beat me home. Ya know,

565
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:02,220
so it's that last bit on, Ya know, right.

566
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:06,990
Homea now. So piss on me. Beat
me, piss on me. Beat me on me.

567
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,340
I know that last bit. Homing.
Yeah. Really gets to people. Okay.

568
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:15,460
Yeah. So here is, I'm
going to run through,

569
00:37:15,461 --> 00:37:18,880
these are all the ones that were suggested
at least a few times. It's a few.

570
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:24,020
The first one which was
suggested the most actually okay.

571
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:29,170
Is that he's saying home yet and
it's because this is after he says,

572
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,030
um, yeah, uh, you got a friend,
your frank and moving to, right.

573
00:37:34,031 --> 00:37:34,900
So call me out.

574
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,750
So he's saying like homie out to all
your friends is what they're saying. Yes,

575
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:42,010
homie out Amina.
But then I hear homea now,

576
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,880
right homie on out is what they're, some
people are saying he's saying home. Yeah,

577
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,260
no homie on out,
you know,

578
00:37:47,261 --> 00:37:52,261
like homey on out homie homie on out.

579
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,980
So people heard help a man out. Oh yeah,
of course. When I say these things,

580
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:01,670
none of them should be heard
clearly because he's in this like,

581
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,860
he's so fired up. Frantic. Yeah.

582
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:08,030
That he's basically tripping
over the words right now. Sorry.

583
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:12,700
Will help a man out. Let me hear it again.
Help me out. You know palm. Yeah. No, no,

584
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:17,410
no, no. That's how some are saying,
hold on man out. How a man out.

585
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:21,580
Yeah. How a man, oh Ho, Ho, Ho man out.

586
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,900
How a man out on me. I know.
Some people are hearing,

587
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,573
uh,

588
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:33,880
hold me down. So it's like piss
on me. Beat me, hold me down.

589
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:38,870
Like he's, you know, I mean Piss,
somebody beat me. Oh Man. No, no,

590
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,510
no. Uh, own me. They in and out. Well,

591
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:46,630
that's interesting.
Let's people heard on me.

592
00:38:46,631 --> 00:38:50,920
I know a lot of people heard
hollow me out. In other words,

593
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:57,190
he's saying, hollow me out. Hollow
me out. Maybe. How long me out?

594
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,910
Let me hear it. Oh Man. No,
I think it's how a man out

595
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:06,820
a, it kept going. People, some of the
people heard whole menu like piss on me.

596
00:39:06,821 --> 00:39:10,790
Beat me that. No, he's
not that creative. No. Um,

597
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,090
the big one that really stood out to me.

598
00:39:13,091 --> 00:39:15,370
I'll tell you which one that I
started to believe I was hearing.

599
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:21,100
This one was explained to me by someone
is hone me out and to hone something out

600
00:39:22,001 --> 00:39:25,770
means to make a whole bigger.
Let's hear it.

601
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,150
Hone me out. Hone me out. All me.

602
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:34,060
I know now that would be such
an advanced word for him.

603
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:38,950
He's not thinking that what?
I threw an effect on it.

604
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:44,410
That was terrifying. Now here's
what I did right here. Okay.

605
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:49,630
So here's what I actually believe
to be what he's saying. Okay.

606
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:50,861
I believe,

607
00:39:50,861 --> 00:39:54,880
and this was suggested by a number
of people that he is actually saying,

608
00:39:56,110 --> 00:40:00,850
I'm home home here now. I'm
home right now. Oh Shit Dude.

609
00:40:00,851 --> 00:40:04,600
That's it. That's that one.
Resonate. And here's why. That's it.

610
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:08,590
Moments before he gave out his address.
Yeah, that makes sense. And he's like,

611
00:40:08,591 --> 00:40:10,840
I'm home wine now. So he's like
pissed on me. Beat me at home.

612
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:15,130
Like he's saying to come over home right
now so you can do those things right

613
00:40:15,131 --> 00:40:15,964
now.

614
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:20,980
I even did an edit where I tried
to split up how fast he says it

615
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:26,310
home here now.
Yeah.

616
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,470
And it's kind of like I'm a hot
white come back when he steps on it,

617
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:34,360
like I'm home right now and he's so
hopped up that he can't get the words out

618
00:40:34,361 --> 00:40:38,560
fast enough to just strike home.
So now it's pissed on me,

619
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:42,070
beat me now try to here home
here, now I'm home here, I'm home

620
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:48,840
home, Ya know? Oh mere.
Now I'm home and I'm home.

621
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,620
I'm home here now.

622
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,760
Do those things right now I'm
home and I'm here now. Yeah,

623
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:57,880
that's what he's saying. But he, that's
what he's saying. He's too frantic.

624
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,780
You know home.
You know I'm here now.

625
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,300
I'm home on here now and that and that
makes sense actually with his accent and

626
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:11,600
his hair. Would you want to say is piss
on me? Beat me. I'm home right now.

627
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:15,010
Come on over it now. It's my address.
It makes total sense. I think that is

628
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,900
all me. I know I'm home. I'm here now.

629
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:25,690
Can I tell you something?
I rarely get my mind blown like I'm,

630
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,450
my mind is blown because I
would never have heard that,

631
00:41:28,451 --> 00:41:31,660
but once you point that out,
that makes it,

632
00:41:31,661 --> 00:41:34,280
it makes sense in the context of
the other parts of the message.

633
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:37,580
I was impressed by it. Yeah,
I'm home. I'm here now.

634
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:42,610
What I was almost more impressed by as
soon as we uploaded last week's podcast

635
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:51,430
where I shared my version and asked
our listeners to share their version,

636
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:56,120
try it out.
It started to come in right away.

637
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,320
Go off the fucking fuck.

638
00:41:58,321 --> 00:42:02,960
Good feel black guy and you
want to fuck me moving in.

639
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:07,860
You can move in. You got to fucking,
I need to be fucked a lot, man.

640
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:11,720
You get free food for your
rent. Everything else, man.

641
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:15,300
This dude man in jail,
homeless.

642
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:19,040
You're thug and want to come and move in.

643
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,540
Your friend can move
into man for your rent.

644
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:26,070
You to listen to CUNY puts some.
He beat me.

645
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:30,120
You see me on a come over today
and try it out. Try it out man.

646
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:34,360
If you're my building, try not. You
want to fucking piss on my try now

647
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:39,030
man. I'm looking for hardcore
guys and we didn't want to do it.

648
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:44,730
I want him to deliver white
trash. Come dump. What's? Fuck.

649
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,560
Hey,
great.

650
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,670
Oh Wow. That was Alex. Um,

651
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:53,200
I won't let them all play out in detail
obviously, but that was stellar. But yeah,

652
00:42:53,201 --> 00:42:58,190
clay here in my building.
Fuck fuck good. Yeah,

653
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,750
this is creepy in the lines of, that is
perfect. Again with the previous guy,

654
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:02,890
terrible lighting.

655
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:07,720
They did it way better than I did with a
production value chest hair showing the

656
00:43:07,721 --> 00:43:12,110
weird background. Fantastic. Great work
guys. Production values too, right?

657
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:16,680
Got It. And you want to fuck me
at 23 buildings? One, two, eight,

658
00:43:16,681 --> 00:43:20,990
seven keys under the front mat.
I mean unit 12 you want to move in?

659
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,060
You can move it up, man.
I need to get fuck, fuck

660
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,160
clay is going on

661
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:32,080
some black females. He swiped it. Well,

662
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,770
all right.
This is an interpretation.

663
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:40,880
Fuck fuck girls got
the rabbit on the head.

664
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,750
I hadn't seen that.

665
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:51,570
What's the ribbon doing that
ribbon, Mike. Thanks Mike.

666
00:43:51,571 --> 00:43:56,220
Come over my house. 24 whatever.
You got to come over. Fuck me.

667
00:43:56,221 --> 00:43:58,800
Cause I think fuck man,
this is great deal man.

668
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:05,070
I don't care if you're homeless added
jails. So you just got to fuck me man.

669
00:44:05,071 --> 00:44:09,330
Cause it ain't give a fuck the law.
I'm a white trash piece of shit.

670
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:14,350
Big Black Guy in Brooklyn
and you wanna fuck him.

671
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,390
Barely say I know Morgan
half hit me up man.

672
00:44:18,391 --> 00:44:22,100
I'll be out there shaking my little
white hole picks on me. Okay,

673
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:27,110
you got fucking dog friends at fucking
also like the fuck I got a little white

674
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,150
lip.
You want to rip my ass

675
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:34,750
my ass. That's Dana. Dana.

676
00:44:34,751 --> 00:44:39,180
I've took some artistic license on this
interpretation but what works really

677
00:44:39,181 --> 00:44:43,530
well? I like it. It's so dark.

678
00:44:43,531 --> 00:44:45,780
You can barely see this one.
That's hilarious

679
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:48,280
Josh guys.
Well good.

680
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:51,510
You're hot black guy and you
want to flunk me at 2,395

681
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:57,570
when man, but you got leaking fucks
a lot, man. You get free food,

682
00:44:57,571 --> 00:45:01,830
free reign of the necessary
right man from jail, homeless.

683
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:06,250
You want to come move in your
frank and Logan Movement.

684
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,000
You get a lease in to keep this on me.

685
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:09,940
That's great.

686
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,820
You know what I would love to see
as a stage version of this like a,

687
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,600
like a really amazing actor doing this.
Like uh,

688
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:21,730
like Jeremy Irons. Yeah.
Christopher Walken. Really,

689
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:25,600
really talented to like, I mean
these are great. These are fantastic.

690
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,960
And actually start doing when,
when guests come in here,

691
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:34,150
we should start having our guests, uh,
do a cold reading and do the monologue.

692
00:45:34,151 --> 00:45:37,540
Yeah, I think so too. No
prep. That should is so funny.

693
00:45:37,541 --> 00:45:41,980
I do watching other people do it
now. Yeah, it's so it's, you see,

694
00:45:41,981 --> 00:45:45,790
you really get to see the absurdity of
his request and the absurdity of his mind

695
00:45:45,791 --> 00:45:50,050
and how sick he is and, and then just
how ridiculous the whole thing is.

696
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,710
But I think you're right that it's a,
I'm here. I'm home right now, home here.

697
00:45:53,711 --> 00:45:56,500
Now I'm home here now. That's what he's
saying. Here's only beat me at home.

698
00:45:56,510 --> 00:46:00,760
Where are it? You can do it
right now. Yeah. Fuck me right
now. Uh, that makes sense.

699
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:06,140
Contextually it does make sex says,
and he goes, uh, one guy goes, I'm in.

700
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,400
If you're in the building. Yeah. Does
he say that? Yeah, he does. Yeah.

701
00:46:09,401 --> 00:46:12,820
So he's saying I building and trial
child. Yeah. Yeah. I'm, I'm home here.

702
00:46:12,821 --> 00:46:16,120
I'm hearing now I'm here. I know.
Yeah. That's the accident. Is that a,

703
00:46:16,121 --> 00:46:20,030
is it a New York or a movie?
You can move in.

704
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:24,100
We're here right now. Yeah. Yeah. Right.
No, I don't think he's in New York.

705
00:46:24,101 --> 00:46:29,101
I think it's more like a Midwest movie
can move in and then you can move in.

706
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,930
Yeah. I'm here. I'm here right now.

707
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:36,870
I think that, yeah. Uh, well you are the
master. I mean you lived in these places.

708
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:40,890
I'm looking for hardcore guys.
I'm looking for hardcore guys.

709
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,990
If you want to move in you can move in,
but you got to fuck the

710
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:51,540
yeah, it's really crazy.
You know, you're in jail,

711
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:53,910
homeless or around your thug.

712
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:58,440
These clips sometimes you know, you never
know when they stopped giving. Yeah.

713
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:02,850
And this one has just been a fount
of just giving and giving and giving.

714
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,320
What a wonderful, what a one. I wish
we had his name is his real name. Yeah.

715
00:47:07,321 --> 00:47:09,810
I don't know.
I can live without knowing his name.

716
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:17,130
Oh Man. Yeah. Like great job. Thanks
for sending those in. Um, oddly enough,

717
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:19,800
I don't think we got a female submission.
Really?

718
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,820
Hell are you saying no women? Maybe
there is. I don't know. I haven't,

719
00:47:23,821 --> 00:47:25,110
I haven't checked my,

720
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:29,040
just let blue band send them then
let this be a call out to everybody.

721
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,100
We need a female

722
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:34,840
version of the moving. You can
move in, try it out. Um, or a clip.

723
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:39,700
Provide us with a new clip of a woman
acting completely insane and hopped up on

724
00:47:39,701 --> 00:47:43,960
math and requesting decks and
seconds and stuff. Yeah, let's,

725
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:46,360
let's get a woman clip. I mean,
no, if a woman does the video,

726
00:47:46,361 --> 00:47:50,680
she's probably a little scared that it's
Debbie take taking kind of seriously.

727
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,970
Yeah. You know what I mean? Well, no, I
mean, let's find a new clip. I hear you.

728
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:59,290
I hear you. I like to see them.
You go move when you're moving.

729
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,520
You're moving a man. That was
great. That was really fun.

730
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:08,430
I really was. Hey, did we mention, I
got to mention real quick. Yeah. Um,

731
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:13,450
you know, I dunno if you know Cardi
B. Yeah. My favorite singer of course.

732
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:18,600
Uh, Diala I, yeah, I make money moves,

733
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:23,590
got a new album out and doing really well.
She is just killing that. Yeah. Anyway.

734
00:48:23,591 --> 00:48:26,720
Bodak yellow.
It's her big song playing old songs,

735
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:31,540
but she's, she's just, she's
doing so well right now. Anyway,

736
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:35,980
she and I planned our pregnancies
at the same time and, uh,

737
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,760
she's doing July as well. I didn't
realize that. Yeah, we should, uh,

738
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,390
we should give her the heads up.
Yeah, I was thinking on Twitter.

739
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:48,400
Maybe if you guys could let her know
that her baby is due the same time as the

740
00:48:48,401 --> 00:48:49,690
famous comedian,
Christina p,

741
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:55,150
that would be amazing if,
you know,

742
00:48:55,151 --> 00:48:58,200
the way we got Gloria
Stefan's attention to,

743
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:03,250
to talk about she came on our
show and our show. What if, uh,

744
00:49:03,251 --> 00:49:08,251
you guys hit Cardi B of so much about
the fact that she's doing Christina's do

745
00:49:11,261 --> 00:49:16,060
that. She's like, Yo, who the
fuck Christina Pete. Well,

746
00:49:16,061 --> 00:49:18,820
how would it fuck cause she,
yeah, she's got that accent.

747
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:22,930
I'd be mine and my own business and
I opened my Twitter album. Yeah.

748
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:26,420
That would be amazing. Hit we
you, who the fuck is Jamar?

749
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:31,240
You Tag Cardi B be like, Hey
Cardi B, we should it be,

750
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:35,890
should we ask her? No. Did you know
Cardi B? Did you know it's pretty cool.

751
00:49:35,891 --> 00:49:37,960
Your due dates, the same
Christina beer. Yeah.

752
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:42,630
How cool of you to get pregnant
the same time as she is. So,

753
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:46,990
uh, it's, I am Cardi B by those
wizard is her hands her handle?

754
00:49:46,991 --> 00:49:50,740
I am Cardi B so it hit her up and be like,

755
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,233
um,

756
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:58,610
are you guys going to have your
babies in the same room? Yeah.

757
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:03,410
Yeah. Just make any reference to
Christina being pregnant with her.

758
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,310
So just be like, Hey,
I didn't know, uh, the,

759
00:50:07,311 --> 00:50:09,810
you're giving birth the same
time as Christina p. Yeah.

760
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:13,150
Did you plan to have the baby at
the same time as Christina piece?

761
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:14,963
Hmm.

762
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:20,970
Are you going to have a, a baby party
with Christina p with the families?

763
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:24,670
Do or would you have baby
showers together? What's
happening? We're going to, yeah,

764
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,940
she's on the east coast. I'm on the
west coast. Let's make it happen. Uh,

765
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:29,540
check out this guy.
Just,

766
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:32,540
this is the kind of guy I could see
you getting like rolling your eyes at,

767
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:34,730
I think this is on the train
or something somewhere.

768
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,450
So this guy from me once he taught
at prostitutes pee in his mouth,

769
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:55,940
so I think he's drunk on a subway
or a train or something. Okay.

770
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:02,043
Drinking mouthwash.

771
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:16,600
This guy, that guy just reading is down.
Don't even look, you know what that is?

772
00:51:16,601 --> 00:51:20,290
That's big city experience right there.
That's when you have been,

773
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:25,240
you know that if you go like that, very
exciting. You're going to antagonize,

774
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:29,320
you're going to provoke. He's like,
I'm just repeating what somebody says.

775
00:51:29,321 --> 00:51:31,750
Shit like that on a train
next to you. No. Yeah.

776
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:34,870
You act like you don't hear a fucking
thing and you just record them through

777
00:51:34,871 --> 00:51:35,920
your bicycle.
Yeah.

778
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:37,223
Yeah.

779
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:52,343
Okay.

780
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,570
This clip for me is really about the
guy sitting next to him was great.

781
00:51:55,571 --> 00:52:00,460
Trying not to laugh right now. That's
fantastic. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, what is,

782
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:01,630
what is my life,
right?

783
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:09,700
Yeah.

784
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,470
Yeah. He started to laugh here.
You started to laugh at the end.

785
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:16,780
He broke the guy next to him.
Yeah. It's um hmm. That's a,

786
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:21,820
that's a, that's an interesting,
what would you really need
a prostitute for that?

787
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:26,680
That's to me, that seems like an easy
ask the wife or the girlfriend. What? No,

788
00:52:26,681 --> 00:52:29,530
it's not. You could ask me to do,
I'll try and I'll try it. All right.

789
00:52:29,531 --> 00:52:31,110
I'll pee in your mouth will
be on your fucking face.

790
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:35,140
Not something most people
ask there. Oh No, I don't.

791
00:52:35,141 --> 00:52:39,010
I don't take offense to that. For me. It's
easy peasy. I'm already paying anyway.

792
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:42,970
Um, yeah, I wouldn't care. I
mean, that's cool. Have you,

793
00:52:42,971 --> 00:52:46,480
but I think most people that are,
that's kind of a,

794
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:51,790
I was, I not horrible. I mean it's kind
of advanced. I don't think most people,

795
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,470
you know, some people are in the p but
aren't most, most probably people aren't.

796
00:52:55,471 --> 00:52:58,300
I'm like, will you pee in my
mouth? And they probably wouldn't.

797
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,930
I don't think they would just be like, oh,
that's a good girlfriend has, but also,

798
00:53:01,931 --> 00:53:06,040
do you think he has a girlfriend?
That's probably what we should lead with.

799
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:09,250
Do you think he's just like, yeah, I'll
just ask my girlfriend for that. No,

800
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,200
I guess, no, I guess not.

801
00:53:11,201 --> 00:53:15,140
He seems a little drunk too
during the day little, yeah,

802
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:19,870
it's dude is fucking hammered. It
looks like it's the morning. Yeah.

803
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:23,740
Yeah. Huh, Huh.

804
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:25,893
And

805
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:27,893
go

806
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:43,270
oof. Really drunk, you know? Let's
see if it says where this was,

807
00:53:43,271 --> 00:53:46,540
I don't know if this was,
just says that he's the guy

808
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,160
I let prostitutes. PMR mouth.
I like the Vietnam office.

809
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:02,500
Yeah. The world is full of colorful
people. Yeah. So you would be like,

810
00:54:02,501 --> 00:54:05,710
you're on board. If I'm like, I want you
to give a shit. You know what I'm saying?

811
00:54:05,711 --> 00:54:08,500
Like if you're in a relationship
with somebody and that's their thing,

812
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,530
that's easy to accommodate that.
That's not, I'll be honest.

813
00:54:11,531 --> 00:54:15,490
That does not intrigue me.
Why not?

814
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:20,350
I've never been into urine.
I don't like the smell of it,
Daryl. I know, but I just,

815
00:54:20,351 --> 00:54:23,090
you know, most of the time you smell
pee. I don't go like, oh have a smell.

816
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:27,130
Pas excited. I'm like, this
smells like Piss, you know?

817
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:30,910
But it's like that guy that McAfee
guy lets people shit in his mouth.

818
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:33,640
That's to me different ballgame.
It is a different ball game.

819
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:36,670
It's a way different ballgame and those
people should be put somewhere else.

820
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:37,720
But it's mental.

821
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,890
But my point of bringing that up
is just that you know the smell.

822
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:45,850
How do you deal with the smell? The
Pismo? Yeah. Let's put things in context.

823
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:50,020
Your P, this is what the fourth
coffee you've had this morning. Yeah.

824
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:54,400
Second you drink nothing. First of all,
the water champ. Let's look right now.

825
00:54:54,401 --> 00:54:57,700
Who's got delicious clear water
on their t side of the table.

826
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:01,780
Who's drinking mostly water and
a cup. Okay, that's iced coffee.

827
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:05,140
That's your second. And that's
a venti. That's not a small,

828
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:09,820
so the reason your piece smells horrendous
is because you're not hydrating your

829
00:55:09,821 --> 00:55:14,580
mouth. It's smells like a brick of
coffee. Uh, my pee smells great. No,

830
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:18,160
it smells like an entire graph of
coffee being poured into a toilet.

831
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:19,750
I'm looking for Posey.
If anyone out there.

832
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,220
My p does it smell a lot?

833
00:55:24,221 --> 00:55:27,670
Because it's pretty clear cause I
drink a lot of water. You see? No,

834
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:31,540
I drink a lot of water. No you don't.
Yes I do. I drink mostly water. Water.

835
00:55:31,541 --> 00:55:34,630
Now Liars having a coffee. That doesn't
mean I don't drink mostly water.

836
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:38,830
I never see you drink water. I only see
you drinking brown coffee. Oh my God.

837
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:42,910
You're such a liar. You're such
a psycho liar. I never see it.

838
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:49,090
You cannot be trusted. That's what
I know for sure. P of my mouth.

839
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,730
You're a fucking liar.
You wouldn't want me to pee in your mouth.

840
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:56,800
No nastiest shit. I went. Okay, well
you don't have to drink it. Does he?

841
00:55:57,370 --> 00:56:01,000
Does he drink it or he just,
that's what I'm wondering.

842
00:56:01,001 --> 00:56:03,680
He doesn't drink it though, right? How
do you know he doesn't drink it? Well,

843
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:06,760
does the macafee guy eat the poo
poo or he just, I don't know.

844
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:10,870
We act like I fucking hang out with
these guys. You Watch the documentary?

845
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,010
They talk about whether he eats it?
No.

846
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:17,980
Why does nobody asks the pressing
questions in these films? I don't know.

847
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:22,420
That's like the biggest question. Do you
want to get pissed in your mouth? No. Why?

848
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:26,290
I'm not interested.

849
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:29,290
I've never thought why don't you let me
pee in your mouth and you can masturbate

850
00:56:29,291 --> 00:56:33,730
at the same time? Why not? Excuse
me. But the next time you masturbate,

851
00:56:33,731 --> 00:56:37,240
do you mind if I, what does she
say? I Dunno. I remember that lady.

852
00:56:37,241 --> 00:56:39,990
She's like to ask for Anal Lingus.
Do you mind if I

853
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,560
um, it's a very specific
thing. Fetish? Yeah.

854
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:52,390
You want to try it? No. How
do you know you won't like it?

855
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:55,870
I know I won't like it. What
part of it? No, I won't like it.

856
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:59,860
It's too hot. It's weird. I
honestly, it's not the smell.

857
00:56:59,861 --> 00:57:02,600
It's the temperature I think would
freak me out. Maybe it'll turn you on.

858
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,260
I don't think so either.
You could roll around in it.

859
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:08,650
Why don't you lay in the tub?
Live someone pay in your mouth.

860
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:13,150
I'm not averse to having
your fluids on me.

861
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:15,490
Like obviously I don't care about that.

862
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:18,670
I really do think it's the
warmth of the P and my mouth.

863
00:57:18,671 --> 00:57:20,710
That would make me want to vomit.

864
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:24,070
Cause it's like body temperature
except your ps really hot.

865
00:57:24,071 --> 00:57:29,071
Actually I think your p is like 105
degrees because it's so brown and thick.

866
00:57:29,531 --> 00:57:33,280
No, it's, it's like that guy's calm like
the four stroke p. That's cause it's,

867
00:57:33,281 --> 00:57:37,690
there's no water and it's just so chunky.
And it was like Brown chunks come out.

868
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:42,390
No, it's the temperature
more than anything. Um,

869
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:47,230
and your piece specifically
smells very pungent, very strong,

870
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:48,850
very strong smell.

871
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,340
When I go pee on your pee in the
middle of the night and I smell it,

872
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:56,830
it's so dark. It's so brown with
the P is like a brown. Cool.

873
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:01,420
It's clear. It's clear
as day. Oh No. Oh No.

874
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:06,220
Let's go take a pee challenge right now.
I'll fucking show you my piece.

875
00:58:06,221 --> 00:58:07,960
Clear years is Brown. No, it's not.

876
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:13,330
You say stupid shit nonstop and no one
calls you on course. I say stupid shit.

877
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:16,450
This is your mom's house, baby. This
is the platform for stupid shit.

878
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:19,960
I drink nothing but water
and coffee all day. Okay.

879
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,790
Then why does it smell like coffee?
Only it doesn't. That's what I'm saying.

880
00:58:24,791 --> 00:58:28,320
You're a fucking liar. Show strong. Okay.

881
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:34,310
Your P's mostly red. Okay. Red p.

882
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:38,270
Yeah. Right now being pregnant
from blood. Yeah. Okay.

883
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:45,640
That makes no sense. But yeah. No,
and I actually, I'll be honest,

884
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:49,090
you scared me with how little
water you've been drinking.

885
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:53,350
I'm being totally serious.
I see you drinking soda,

886
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:58,990
drinking alcohol,
but I don't see you drinking water.

887
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:02,410
I'm serious. Okay. Okay. Listen,

888
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:05,950
can I read an email that came in
from our friend Matt on these coasts?

889
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:11,230
I'm sure he says the sons,
they were having a,

890
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:15,580
a family discussion and it's kind of an
interesting topic and I definitely think

891
00:59:15,581 --> 00:59:19,570
it's appropriate for our show.
Okay. So what'd you do this?

892
00:59:19,571 --> 00:59:22,040
Once you take this offer,
it's a would you rather?

893
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,990
Okay.
Okay.

894
00:59:23,991 --> 00:59:28,580
From this moment until the end of your
life all of course I'm fucking blind.

895
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:34,220
All the food you eat will taste like the
best version of whatever it is you're

896
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:38,420
eating. So if you're eating pizza, it
will taste like the best pizza ever.

897
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,900
If you're eating snoozers,
it's the best snu she ever.

898
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,630
But every time you fart,

899
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,530
it will smell 1% worse than the last part.

900
00:59:48,531 --> 00:59:52,220
You may with no limit on how smelly
your farts will become over time.

901
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:56,540
So once you accept the deal, the next
fart you make will be the baseline.

902
00:59:56,570 --> 01:00:01,160
Do you make this deal? Why or why not?
Um, so thank you Matt for submitting this.

903
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:06,830
Both things happen in this scenario.
So you get the best food ever,

904
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:11,240
but every time you fart it gets
1% worse than the last time.

905
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:15,500
I mean, who would not
take that deal? Well,

906
01:00:15,501 --> 01:00:18,440
cause your farts are going to be
horrendous. By the end of your life.

907
01:00:18,441 --> 01:00:22,190
It's going to be napalm.
Who Cares? Who Cares?

908
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:26,600
I care. You're fortunate already bad. And
that there's no such thing as good fart,

909
01:00:26,601 --> 01:00:29,990
so it's already smells disastrous.
You're saying it's going to smell worse,

910
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:33,530
but you get the best taste
ever whenever you eat anything.

911
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,830
I mean this is an easy one. Yeah,
but it's not for me. Here's why

912
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:42,770
is that I don't want my food to taste
the best ever. Cause then I get fat.

913
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:47,540
Just fucking whatever. Check
yourself regulate. It's fine. Yeah,

914
01:00:47,541 --> 01:00:49,520
but food tastes even
better than it does now.

915
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:52,250
You know how hard it is for me just
to maintain and not when I'm pregnant.

916
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,670
It's hard. But I mean how could
you turn that? You wouldn't,

917
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:59,780
he's saying that if you have a bite of
a cookie, if you have a piece of paper,

918
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,210
I don't want it to be
the best tasting ever.

919
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:08,240
Cause I be the fattest person ever.
No. Yeah, no. You could just stop you.

920
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:10,160
There's some things you
eat now that are amazing.

921
01:01:10,161 --> 01:01:14,600
You don't just keep going crazy on
them. We can. You have self restraint.

922
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:18,770
1% worse.
Fart every time is terrible.

923
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,480
You won't be able to
stew in your own baby.

924
01:01:20,481 --> 01:01:22,740
You won't even be able to sit
in your own fart. Yeah, you,

925
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,580
but you'd work out a system. You'd be
like, oh, I got a far coming in and you,

926
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:30,290
you go outside and you'd run every time
you have to fart or something and right

927
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,610
behind you. Yeah. You'd just
be like, I got to Fart in the,

928
01:01:32,611 --> 01:01:36,150
you'd run away from your smell,
but what about me? Like you're not,

929
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:39,500
you don't think that'll bother me
over time and getting them outside,

930
01:01:39,501 --> 01:01:43,190
running away from it. But that's a lie.
Okay, let's, let's be realistic here.

931
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:46,760
You're not going to do that.
I just give you a mask.

932
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:51,530
You think I want to sleep with a mask on
set for sleep just for the moment when

933
01:01:51,531 --> 01:01:52,450
I Fart, dude. But you've,

934
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:56,390
here's when your farts mostly happen at
nighttime when we're laying in bed in

935
01:01:56,391 --> 01:01:59,470
the middle of the night, middle
of the night mornings, dude,

936
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,160
you far at like four in the morning,

937
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,760
super loud and then you think it's the
best thing that's ever happened to me.

938
01:02:04,761 --> 01:02:07,220
And I'm like, oh I can, I'll
start old and I wake up,

939
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,950
you fight in the morning to first thing.
So what?

940
01:02:10,951 --> 01:02:14,210
What am I supposed to be worried
about that it smells bad, dude.

941
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:16,670
So when you think I want
to smell that far. Yeah,

942
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:19,440
but I'm getting these great tastes.
I don't care about your tastes.

943
01:02:19,441 --> 01:02:20,500
I care about your farts.
Yeah,

944
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:24,600
but I'm saying that I would take it
because I want to have those great tastes

945
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:28,080
and I don't care if it smells a little
bit worse every time you're going to ruin

946
01:02:28,081 --> 01:02:31,530
your marriage. Why would I ruin it? Look
how bad your dad's farts smell. Yeah,

947
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,360
those are bad.
That's really bad.

948
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:37,110
They have taken up this offer.

949
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:42,930
Somebody may have given him this offer.
I mean his farts smell like this offer.

950
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:44,670
You know what I'm saying?

951
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:49,700
And that's a life Roner like
your dad's farts are just tear.

952
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:54,200
They clear out movie theaters.
You was fucking, you would
survive. I would survive,

953
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:56,490
but I wouldn't be happy. And
why? Why would you be unhappy?

954
01:02:56,491 --> 01:02:58,590
Because just to smell a little
rotten fart every now and then.

955
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:00,540
Every now and then.
My life is your farts.

956
01:03:00,541 --> 01:03:05,310
The other day we were in the kitchen and
you force my hand on your underwear as

957
01:03:05,311 --> 01:03:09,420
you farted on my hand. Do you think
that was nice? I remember that. Yeah.

958
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:13,290
I felt the vibration.
We're doing the cool one where I uh,

959
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,690
I played with my butt sheet as I farted.

960
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:21,540
I remember that one. Yep.
That was pretty cool.

961
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:25,590
I just feel like I deal with a lot of
your farts and for them to smell worser.

962
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:30,300
Why worser is not, it's
not cool for me. It's fine.

963
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:34,590
I feel like it's fine. We'll have fun with
your second wife. Let's talk about her.

964
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:35,653
I think she's like,

965
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:41,460
I think your second wife is going to be
a Dalmatian cause second wives usually

966
01:03:41,461 --> 01:03:44,230
are. Yeah. We've been
studying some second wives.

967
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:48,900
We know some people that are on their
second wife likes showbiz second wives.

968
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,440
You know what I'm saying?
Like the guy gets a little cash,

969
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:54,660
he has a midlife crisis.

970
01:03:54,661 --> 01:03:59,520
He dumps the first wife and the kids and
the family and then runs off with just

971
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:04,140
the fucking skanky.
IEST dumbest it happens.

972
01:04:04,690 --> 01:04:09,570
Happens a lot. So you need a few
times. Yeah. And it's, you know,

973
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:14,280
of course it's admirable. Everybody
goes, that's awesome. Um, but yeah,

974
01:04:14,281 --> 01:04:19,200
I mean like what, who, who do you, how
do you see it playing out for me? Um,

975
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:24,090
I definitely think that your second
wife is going to be way younger.

976
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,840
I'd be like, Hey, let's start
with like age. We're going to go,

977
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:31,500
this happens probably like, what,
five, six years from now in your mind.

978
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:32,334
The kids are grown.

979
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:40,440
Yeah, they're fine. They're fine.
They're doing great in elementary school.

980
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:43,830
And then you, you know, you're
a big movie star, big celebrity,

981
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:49,050
one of your ingenue costars she just
turned 20. She's like the new hot Winnie.

982
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:53,940
She's 20.
She's 20 years old and a blah.

983
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:58,830
I know you like blondes and
just really not demanding,

984
01:04:58,831 --> 01:05:02,190
like not smart. That's all
right. That's like the key,

985
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:06,510
the key to it from what
I've seen, uh, on these, uh,

986
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:12,450
these second wife. Yeah. A
lot, a lot less of this chat.

987
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:15,330
A lot less opinions,
no opinions,

988
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:19,990
no things you have to do today.
No. You know, there's no,

989
01:05:20,030 --> 01:05:23,920
no schedule or of course,
and that's what I seen that these,

990
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:27,730
the midlife guy goes towards it.
It's like, oh, this is great.

991
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:31,720
Then he sometimes has to remember that.

992
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:35,800
Then there's going to be
no opinions, no pain, no,

993
01:05:35,801 --> 01:05:40,210
no conversations that are going to be
decent. She's got to say stuff like wow,

994
01:05:40,211 --> 01:05:44,380
bay. But she'll call you babe
a lot, baby. Oh my God, baby.

995
01:05:44,381 --> 01:05:47,070
I love this.
Might have hair extensions,

996
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:51,670
a big fake tits and she's just going to
say things I have to a big fake tits, so.

997
01:05:51,671 --> 01:05:55,180
Right. I mean, she does. She's the second
wife. They all do. They all have second.

998
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:59,220
I think. I don't die. I
don't think so. You know? Um,

999
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:04,450
wow. This is awesome. Like those are
the phrases you're going to hear a lot.

1000
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:09,110
Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Oh, I love you babe.

1001
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:13,130
Yeah, Dalmatian Talk. Yeah.

1002
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:16,610
The second wife has to be way dumber
than the first. Oh, definitely. That's,

1003
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:20,800
that's part of what you're looking for.
Way less qualified as a human.

1004
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:25,140
It's just like a stupid girl and she's
just like, your kids are so cute.

1005
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:30,980
Tell him I keep, my kids are not good.

1006
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
This feels more girlfriend then
wife though. No, that's the point.

1007
01:06:34,001 --> 01:06:38,620
See that's the thing is that it should
be just a girlfriend like and then what?

1008
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:38,951
Then I'm like,

1009
01:06:38,951 --> 01:06:43,480
Oh fuck no you love it because you've
had the first wife who was all these,

1010
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,490
you know, words, words, words, ideas,

1011
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:51,070
orders and you're so over it and upset
that like the Dalmatians a relief cause

1012
01:06:51,071 --> 01:06:53,410
you can just do what you want.
Come and go as you please.

1013
01:06:53,411 --> 01:06:57,010
You are singing to me right
now. I love it. When um,

1014
01:06:57,790 --> 01:06:59,170
how do you prevent this from happening?

1015
01:06:59,171 --> 01:07:03,870
Cause it sounds like just how do
I prevent you got it. He tell me.

1016
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:05,900
I don't know. I just, that's great.

1017
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:14,660
20 Ted, stupid as, as all get out and,

1018
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:17,760
and like my kids spend a lot
of time with her and they her,

1019
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:19,250
oh that's the other parts of things

1020
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:24,970
like emotionally she's about the
same level. She's like I got,

1021
01:07:24,971 --> 01:07:28,960
I got them slime, we did a slime party
and I'm like, what's a slime party?

1022
01:07:29,290 --> 01:07:30,280
All the kids are doing it.

1023
01:07:30,281 --> 01:07:33,370
And she rented out a room at the
chuck e cheese or whatever. Fucking,

1024
01:07:33,410 --> 01:07:35,710
we all had slime party and
she's the coolest. I'll be like,

1025
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:38,590
cause she knows all this stuff
cause she's a fucking drum.

1026
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:42,190
Shandy said the store's name.

1027
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:50,530
Yeah, she's awesome. She had the, she
had, he let me get hair extensions.

1028
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:54,280
Shandy tech me to the salon. No, no.

1029
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:58,720
Shanti Shanti and we'll get them acrylic
nails when they're like seven my boys.

1030
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:01,870
Oh that's right. We didn't want them
girls. He noticed it but she, she wanted,

1031
01:08:01,871 --> 01:08:06,130
she wanted a whore up your daughters,
if you had writers spoil them,

1032
01:08:06,131 --> 01:08:09,280
let them do what they want and you
have to hear about how great Shandy is.

1033
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,130
You think you would just
tolerate it? Oh my God. No.

1034
01:08:12,131 --> 01:08:16,160
I would go to a mental hospital like I
would if you did that shit to me and our

1035
01:08:16,161 --> 01:08:20,150
family. Yeah. I would just
be institutionalized. I think
they would just give up.

1036
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:25,070
Oh my God, how it works. How do
I get this done? This is great.

1037
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:29,590
I would just be, I would be a
shell if you did this to me. Oh,

1038
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,000
that's what that second wife,
so what's second husband like?

1039
01:08:32,001 --> 01:08:35,750
Usually a second husband.
Women shut it down.

1040
01:08:36,510 --> 01:08:40,490
I think women, if you, if you had
this happened to you sometimes,

1041
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:41,540
here's how it goes to waste.

1042
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:45,350
The 50 year old woman just either
shuts it down like Jane Fonda,

1043
01:08:45,351 --> 01:08:49,700
she's older than that 50 but yeah,
she just came out and she was like,

1044
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,960
shut it down like women and go the other
way where they're like, I'm over it.

1045
01:08:53,961 --> 01:08:58,760
I'm never getting married again. I don't
need a vagina. I'm fine. I'm in menopause.

1046
01:08:58,761 --> 01:09:03,530
Don't touch me. I'm having hot
flashes. Or they go hypersexual. Yeah.

1047
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:06,350
And they're like,
I'm going to adult con this weekend.

1048
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:07,740
I'm going to touch vibrators and,

1049
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:11,980
and I'm a MILF guys and they really
advertise themselves as a Melph.

1050
01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:16,490
Maybe you do that. Maybe you start a new
site. Yeah. W from foreign ministers.

1051
01:09:16,491 --> 01:09:19,100
I just convert it to Christina.

1052
01:09:19,101 --> 01:09:22,520
gilt.com get off. I'm like, grandma,

1053
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:24,230
you're going to be some point.

1054
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:30,050
God
No,

1055
01:09:30,051 --> 01:09:34,310
but then I have to lose like 50
pounds and get Lipo and fixed my tits.

1056
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:38,020
If you want to go the hypersexual
and then I go hypersexual which work?

1057
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:41,590
I know you, you'd be like, I don't want
to do all that shit. I'm so lazy. I,

1058
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:46,490
you'd be like, no, no, no,
no. Shut it down. Shut it
down. Uh, but then, you know,

1059
01:09:46,491 --> 01:09:51,380
I'd find some like age gap, Love
Shit, some 28 year old loser,

1060
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:56,360
you know, playing the video games and
I, and I would just take care of him.

1061
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:00,050
That's the equivalent baby. The
Dalmatian wife. That's what I can't see.

1062
01:10:00,051 --> 01:10:04,580
You go in that route. I might, I mean,
what a video game guy. Well, I'm, I'm the,

1063
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,100
I'm the breadwinner and he's just like,
I play a bit down.

1064
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:12,130
Do you think you would like
the Dalmatian life course?

1065
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,570
I'm talking about something
more reasonable for you.

1066
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:17,180
Of course I went to Dalmatian
wife. That's it. But that's not,

1067
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:22,180
that's six years away. Maybe you would
not be a real tolerate six years away. Uh,

1068
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:25,910
how stupid she is. Cause she would say
dumb things. That's true. Oh my God.

1069
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:30,740
All the time. She's so
embarrassing. I would have uh,

1070
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:34,340
uh, dinners, but I'd be like, uh, no.

1071
01:10:34,341 --> 01:10:39,341
I was just going to be me and my friends
cause it would be other couples and

1072
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:44,090
they'd be like, where's your Dalmatian?
I'm like, oh, she had choir practice.

1073
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:44,661
But you know,

1074
01:10:44,661 --> 01:10:48,040
your other friends would talk so much shit
about your down nationwide. Of course.

1075
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:48,771
Oh my God.

1076
01:10:48,771 --> 01:10:53,480
It would never be their go
goto gossip things worse.

1077
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:57,020
We've seen Tom's new wife.
She's so, she's so dumb.

1078
01:10:57,021 --> 01:10:59,670
Christina was so much smarter
than her. Yeah. But then Berge

1079
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:07,200
yeah, no, I know a lot.

1080
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:14,010
Um, you know, I might get into some like
real kinky stuff next. You do. You know,

1081
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:16,470
this is something, I dunno how
much I could tolerate it. This,

1082
01:11:16,471 --> 01:11:19,170
this is so weird to me
that people really do this

1083
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:23,143
Peter Pan,

1084
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:40,530
I think it's so weird to me. So this
is some, a woman likes to be babies.

1085
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:41,670
She's a grown woman,

1086
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:45,170
likes to be treated like a baby and
he pretends to be her dad, dad. Kay.

1087
01:11:45,190 --> 01:11:47,490
This is definitely for doctor.
It's,

1088
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:52,580
here's what strikes me even more besides
the obvious is that we're actually with

1089
01:11:53,070 --> 01:11:54,870
a toddler all the time.

1090
01:11:55,460 --> 01:12:00,460
So the fact that this is somebody's choice
to be like this is really stands out

1091
01:12:00,601 --> 01:12:05,320
of stupid,
stupid or damaged cause yeah,

1092
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:10,170
I think what happened is some so much
trauma like I bet you this one is sexual

1093
01:12:10,171 --> 01:12:14,690
trauma and she wants, she needs
to regress or something. Okay.

1094
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:17,360
Cause she's not embracing adult sexual.

1095
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:21,960
This is why you know those a
porno girls talking baby talk,

1096
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:26,640
that's sexual molestation. How does this
Guy Bang her? Cause you know he's tall,

1097
01:12:26,641 --> 01:12:30,000
he's talking to her like a baby all the
time, you know, and then you're going to,

1098
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:33,810
he's like, he's like, okay, we
read our book, you're ready.
It goes sleep now booboo.

1099
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:38,750
And then, then she's like, Oh why
the fuck? It's like that's really it.

1100
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,890
Do they have intercourse? I
Dunno, let's get through it.

1101
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:45,680
I've men who moved Emily and already
crumbling through the power dreary air

1102
01:12:58,910 --> 01:13:01,620
but not really cause I'm fine.

1103
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:08,470
Oh see there you go. Ready? Just to
start. So he is 11 years older than her,

1104
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:14,320
so he doesn't mind taking on,
I guess the, the paternal role.

1105
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:18,040
You know what always stands out to me
about something like this is the effort,

1106
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:21,730
the amount of effort out. Good talking to
you. Like you're fucking baby right now.

1107
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:25,750
Again, I could do this, you
know, I can do this for a date.

1108
01:13:26,290 --> 01:13:27,670
Like if I went out with someone,
they're like,

1109
01:13:27,730 --> 01:13:30,010
talk to me like a baby or
something and be like, all right.

1110
01:13:30,011 --> 01:13:33,010
But then at the end of the
day I'd be like, there's no
way I could do this again.

1111
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:37,330
I don't even think I could last a date.
And this is so wackadoo.

1112
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:40,630
I mean this chick's got so many
fucking metal problems and so does he,

1113
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:45,580
but maybe he likes the dependency of
it. She's totally, you know a baby.

1114
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:47,380
It's so big.
It's so sick.

1115
01:13:49,210 --> 01:13:50,043
Yeah.

1116
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,960
Oh my God. He's going to be like,
you have your shoes. You know,

1117
01:14:04,961 --> 01:14:08,950
we got to go out with shoes. She needs
something. She can't put them on.

1118
01:14:08,951 --> 01:14:12,310
She needs her daddy.
Lg By definition

1119
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:16,600
is daddy don little girl.
And it is a subsection of Bdsm,

1120
01:14:16,601 --> 01:14:20,830
which is a part of kink. I was just
discovering things about the community,

1121
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:23,540
learning a bit more about it.
I decided to um,

1122
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:27,370
try it out and I've just loved
it ever since. It's just me

1123
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:33,450
try it out. So this, this grinds or
crank, it's really gets her going.

1124
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:35,220
This is a second. I
mean, I guess, you know,

1125
01:14:35,850 --> 01:14:39,960
I'd like to encourage people
to find out what they like.

1126
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:42,810
I got to tell you this.
I don't want the adult baby diaper thing.

1127
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:44,370
I don't get either.
I don't,

1128
01:14:44,371 --> 01:14:48,630
I don't understand what the turn on
is about being an infant or acting.

1129
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:52,340
It's really, that's your wires
are crossed, man is some flex

1130
01:14:52,410 --> 01:14:53,640
and wire crossed shit.

1131
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:57,470
There are a lot of people in the
community that do this sexually. Um,

1132
01:14:57,471 --> 01:15:01,450
and I'm not one of those
people completely, no
sexual lifestyle for me. Oh,

1133
01:15:01,470 --> 01:15:02,220
thank God.
Okay.

1134
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:05,280
Okay. So now that, that's more
so that means that she does fuck,

1135
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:09,420
but only when she's out of Cara. Thank
God I ain't, you know what I mean?

1136
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:11,420
I think the role,
I understand the role playing.

1137
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:15,870
Maybe she's healing some childhood trauma
or something, but the fucking, the fire,

1138
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:21,840
the guy, oh my God. Look like,
how's your girlfriend? Good.

1139
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:26,730
What do you guys do for fun?
Well, she pretends to be five.

1140
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:29,480
We go to the park. Yeah. Do play dough.

1141
01:15:30,570 --> 01:15:33,830
Max First told me that
she was this lifestyle.

1142
01:15:33,890 --> 01:15:36,180
She had shown me the videos that she
was watching. She showed me a copy.

1143
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:40,920
I know I'm a Jesus showing her how to
count and uh, going over the alphabet.

1144
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,950
You're like, what? Yeah.
Push her on the swings.

1145
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:48,090
There's a teeter totter or she could
spell her name. She could spell my name.

1146
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:52,970
Uh, could you spell the dog's name? Yeah,

1147
01:15:52,971 --> 01:15:56,910
we're really in a Thomas the train right
now. Can you count all at tenant back?

1148
01:15:58,450 --> 01:16:03,150
Does your girlfriend? Yeah, she likes
Peppa the pig. I saw that. Yeah.

1149
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:04,053
That's a good one.

1150
01:16:04,330 --> 01:16:05,180
Was it?
She was watching,

1151
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,860
she was eating these babies
snacks and I think that's when we,

1152
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:10,720
that's when we had the
conversation about it.

1153
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:13,990
No, you mean this fucking
asshole. Nice though, right?

1154
01:16:13,991 --> 01:16:18,090
It's Cosby sweater and his ear plug his
butt plugs in his ears. And all this,

1155
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:22,110
but he's a nice guy. Is he a nice guy
for doing this? To hear this psycho?

1156
01:16:22,330 --> 01:16:23,163
I think so.

1157
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:24,171
What's his deal?

1158
01:16:24,171 --> 01:16:29,160
Went down on more hardcore
versions of the DLG subset,

1159
01:16:29,161 --> 01:16:32,840
but for a lot of, for a lot
of people is nonsexual. It's,

1160
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:34,940
and for us it's nonsexual.
Do you

1161
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:36,260
imagine getting this shit?

1162
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:40,400
I know it's nuts isn't to just show you
the really is someone for everyone now.

1163
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:43,970
There is man. It's the inner
how lucky that she found him.

1164
01:16:43,971 --> 01:16:48,890
I would say because most guys, if she
was dating and she was like, I go,

1165
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:53,910
I, I learned blue sky blue and
those, you know, he'd be like,

1166
01:16:53,930 --> 01:16:57,080
did it and then this is a square. They
look the fuck are you doing right now?

1167
01:16:58,190 --> 01:17:02,480
Come wipe me. Yeah. I mean this is
like other level. Could you imagine?

1168
01:17:02,481 --> 01:17:05,840
I would love to see these two playing in
the park. I'm like, what is happening?

1169
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:07,100
How weird must it get?

1170
01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:12,230
Cause she said that a lot of in this
lifestyle do a sexual play on this.

1171
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:17,300
Yeah, that's what I'm, I'm wondering
what the deal is there. That's real.

1172
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:20,660
I think that's, that's trauma.
Absolutely right. It's gotta be,

1173
01:17:20,661 --> 01:17:24,850
you're reenacting the trauma. Oh
fuck. I mean there's, there's no way

1174
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:29,710
I have a little, a lot of the time,
especially when we're at home. Cool.

1175
01:17:29,910 --> 01:17:34,120
When we're just relaxing and I'm with
him. I'm little when I want to be, um,

1176
01:17:34,121 --> 01:17:38,500
I'm a little when it's right to be,
but of course it's,

1177
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:42,490
it's not something that like I cannot
some trouble like public, you know,

1178
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:47,500
I don't just randomly like shout daddy
because that's involving other people in

1179
01:17:47,501 --> 01:17:49,410
something that they didn't
know. So she's smart. Okay.

1180
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:53,540
Yeah. She understands boundaries.
She understands indoor, outdoor.

1181
01:17:53,541 --> 01:17:57,800
The is fun for her. She, yeah.
You know what? Now that I
see her, she seems rational.

1182
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,570
Yeah. And it just brings her joy and
then, you know, good for her. Yeah.

1183
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:04,560
But she definitely needs to make an
appointment with a therapist and, and uh,

1184
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:07,970
get on that. She really likes
pretending to be a little girl,

1185
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:12,090
might want to talk to somebody.
Daddy takes care of me,

1186
01:18:12,091 --> 01:18:14,670
but I also take care of him.
We take care of each other.

1187
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:19,500
And I think having that nurturing aspect
to the relationship really makes it

1188
01:18:19,501 --> 01:18:20,334
strong.

1189
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:30,070
Okay. You know, this could be growth,
this could be a wife number two. Oh boy.

1190
01:18:30,071 --> 01:18:34,040
It is like it is the same thing.
Yeah. For me basically, you know,

1191
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:36,400
dependent dumb,
dumb.

1192
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:41,740
Now this, this chick needs
serious mental counseling.

1193
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:43,340
See if she's still under this.

1194
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:45,910
And is there anything that just just
like going to a shrink once a week,

1195
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:50,890
twice a week maybe for her will just
do wonders. Yeah. I think getting out,

1196
01:18:50,891 --> 01:18:54,130
I think this discussion would, she needs
some professional. We're out a lot. Yeah.

1197
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:58,340
I have an extensive list of rules,

1198
01:18:58,341 --> 01:19:01,460
but the main ones are no tantrums.

1199
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:05,420
I'm no saying no and those are the
two that I'm not that great at.

1200
01:19:05,730 --> 01:19:08,600
If I break a rule,

1201
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:11,050
then I get timeouts.

1202
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:14,720
I just have to sit here in the corner
and stare at the wall and do nothing.

1203
01:19:15,370 --> 01:19:17,020
Yeah.
What the fuck is this all about?

1204
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:22,740
What's going on?
Why are you doing this?

1205
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:27,010
What the fuck is going on as a
ride? But Hey, you know what?

1206
01:19:27,011 --> 01:19:31,390
It sounds like she's a pretty rational
human and she knows what, Hey,

1207
01:19:31,391 --> 01:19:35,450
this is my fun time.
I I boundaries and I do this in the house.

1208
01:19:37,170 --> 01:19:42,170
Explain this lifestyle in terms of a
little whose lifestyle is kind of like a

1209
01:19:43,221 --> 01:19:46,610
coloring book where she hands me the
lines and I can just fill them in with

1210
01:19:46,611 --> 01:19:49,990
whatever we're calling
on one. Oh boy. Yeah.

1211
01:19:51,450 --> 01:19:54,630
What is a fire? She's five and she's
still drinking out of a sippy. Yeah.

1212
01:19:54,631 --> 01:19:57,750
Get on your advanced sippy stuff.
Well,

1213
01:19:57,751 --> 01:20:00,310
she can drink out of a cup by now at five.
Yeah.

1214
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:04,620
Ellis was the same exact to sip it. You
stopped that one. He stopped this. Yeah.

1215
01:20:04,621 --> 01:20:08,520
To go to school. I mean they don't
even let you bring that in. Vulnerable

1216
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:12,240
and so open in little space that
that's where I want to keep it.

1217
01:20:12,241 --> 01:20:17,010
Like it's a safe place and it's a place
that we share together on the day,

1218
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:19,860
Christ and the bass

1219
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:25,220
that would wear so quick right

1220
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:28,530
now. I know. And she said like,
oh, don't worry. I'll be like, hey,

1221
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:34,160
can you stop doing that?
That'd be so bad at being that that,

1222
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:38,160
but that's also the the time we live
in this whole safe place. Horse Shit.

1223
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:42,210
This is my safe place. I think you'd
be, we'll fucking weird is I want, yeah.

1224
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:47,580
What is wrong with these?
We will have fun decency anymore.

1225
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:48,901
You know what I'm saying?

1226
01:20:48,901 --> 01:20:53,610
Like can we just go back to repressing
our desires like a normal society and be

1227
01:20:53,611 --> 01:20:58,080
contributing members just for press this
shit and go do something else with your

1228
01:20:58,081 --> 01:21:03,030
life. That's good advice. You know what
I mean? Go, go contribute to society.

1229
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:06,000
That's good advice. Press desires
are good because they make you,

1230
01:21:06,001 --> 01:21:09,700
you sublimate them through other things.
This, I know you're going to get a kill.

1231
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:12,540
Fucking won a Nobel prize. You Psycho.
You're going to have some money.

1232
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:15,430
Great thoughts. All right, I'll go ahead
and I'll read this. Okay, so hungry,

1233
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:20,470
I'll read this to you is an
email that came in. Hey moms.

1234
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:25,210
I been with my boyfriend for almost
two years and as he is getting more

1235
01:21:25,211 --> 01:21:29,980
comfortable with me, he's also getting
grocer. But one year into dating.

1236
01:21:29,981 --> 01:21:33,220
We went on a two week long trip,
a few days into the trip.

1237
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:37,000
I noticed that he hadn't taken a shower
yet and he insisted that he showered

1238
01:21:37,001 --> 01:21:39,700
after I'd fallen asleep.
I believe them at first,

1239
01:21:39,701 --> 01:21:43,930
but as the first week went by and noticed
none of the hotel towels removing from

1240
01:21:43,931 --> 01:21:48,460
where I had got put them and the shampoo
and soap hadn't moved the next week he

1241
01:21:48,461 --> 01:21:52,420
got a really bad sunburn and use that as
an excuse to not shower for the rest of

1242
01:21:52,421 --> 01:21:55,120
the trip.
Turns out he didn't shower for a month.

1243
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:57,430
Fast forward to a year later,

1244
01:21:57,730 --> 01:22:01,450
we now live together and he was
showering every few days at first,

1245
01:22:01,451 --> 01:22:05,890
but now he just washes his hair and
his junk maybe once every two weeks.

1246
01:22:06,370 --> 01:22:10,360
I confront him about it all the time and
tell him that he smells like dirty skin,

1247
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,780
but he just laughs about it.
I've tried to get him to shower with me,

1248
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:16,450
but he always makes up an excuse.
Also,

1249
01:22:16,451 --> 01:22:19,600
he has the same bottle of soap in
the shower since I first met him.

1250
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:23,890
I worry that I'm starting to not notice
the smell and that our whole apartment

1251
01:22:23,891 --> 01:22:27,090
smells like him. He is also
an athlete. So that makes,

1252
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:29,480
yeah.

1253
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:32,720
Any suggestions to help
me make him shower. Also,

1254
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:36,500
what is the longest you've gone without
shower out and what is an acceptable

1255
01:22:36,501 --> 01:22:39,860
amount of time to go without
one? I can't go two days. Nope.

1256
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:42,740
Thanks for taking the time to
read this. Love the show. Hannah.

1257
01:22:45,110 --> 01:22:49,840
I mean, do you want to start? Well,
I mean, you know, obviously there,

1258
01:22:49,841 --> 01:22:54,841
there is probably some root issue
involved in this being something for him.

1259
01:22:56,871 --> 01:22:58,880
In other words,
this doesn't,

1260
01:22:58,881 --> 01:23:03,410
most people do shower that are normal,
healthy,

1261
01:23:03,890 --> 01:23:08,470
functioning in society.
Yeah. So, uh, I, you know,

1262
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:13,530
there might be something
tied to this guy's childhood.

1263
01:23:14,410 --> 01:23:17,230
Oh,
I might go even something more basic.

1264
01:23:17,231 --> 01:23:22,231
I had a roommate in college that had
severe skin psoriasis or Eczema or

1265
01:23:22,661 --> 01:23:24,380
something, some kind of
skin condition. Yeah.

1266
01:23:24,490 --> 01:23:28,480
And so showering for him was rare as
well because it would aggravate the skin

1267
01:23:28,481 --> 01:23:31,660
condition. So he might have
like a medical, I don't know.

1268
01:23:31,850 --> 01:23:33,870
Well she would pick up on that.
I think that'd be,

1269
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:38,210
if I like to just be adverse to taking
showers. It's, it's definitely unusual.

1270
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:42,260
Especially someone that works out a lot.
Yeah. This is a psychological issue too.

1271
01:23:42,261 --> 01:23:45,080
I think so. Yeah. Cause I mean
that's one of the main things.

1272
01:23:45,081 --> 01:23:47,960
I mean I'm going to go to the gym
here in a minute and it's like, oh,

1273
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:51,810
you come back and you're soaking
wet and yeah, sometimes you know,

1274
01:23:51,811 --> 01:23:56,240
you get distracted and it starts to dry,
but you feel that,

1275
01:23:56,450 --> 01:23:58,030
that dry sweat on you.
And

1276
01:23:59,570 --> 01:24:03,650
you know what? I am, I shower every
day no matter how horrible I feel.

1277
01:24:03,651 --> 01:24:08,030
I think the only times I've ever skipped
is when I've been really ill with a

1278
01:24:08,031 --> 01:24:11,610
fever. Even when I gave birth.
Yeah. I think I showered, uh,

1279
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:14,810
the next I've been very sick
and missed a couple days.

1280
01:24:14,811 --> 01:24:17,200
You know what I'm talking
to. But to set us, yeah.

1281
01:24:18,390 --> 01:24:19,680
Um,
with like a,

1282
01:24:19,681 --> 01:24:24,060
a viral or bacterial infection
or something that vomiting
and you're just like,

1283
01:24:24,061 --> 01:24:27,150
um, and you know, if you have
shakes because you, you know,

1284
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:31,350
your temperatures swinging a
couple of days, but being healthy,

1285
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:34,700
I mean the longest would be
skipping a day because of, yeah.

1286
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:37,770
Because of whatever
scenario, you know, a day,

1287
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:38,620
a day.

1288
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:43,620
But I am so fanatic about my body
is failing clean and feeling fresh.

1289
01:24:44,141 --> 01:24:46,240
I just feel greasy and oily.

1290
01:24:46,490 --> 01:24:50,330
Who doesn't like that?
I love the post clean failing best.

1291
01:24:50,450 --> 01:24:52,880
A lot of times I'll do it.
I've gone through, you know,

1292
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:56,060
a lot of times I shower right before
bed if I have a long day. Yeah.

1293
01:24:56,430 --> 01:24:57,900
It's like I'm about to get
in bed. I was like, no,

1294
01:24:57,901 --> 01:25:00,410
I'm going to shower first shower,
then get in bed.

1295
01:25:00,590 --> 01:25:03,200
Feels good. It feels good.
Yeah. I mean, listen,

1296
01:25:03,201 --> 01:25:07,910
I don't know how this isn't a deal breaker
for this woman sexually. Oh my God.

1297
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:12,410
Because you, uh, uh, just as a
partner I think as a courtesy,

1298
01:25:12,411 --> 01:25:14,990
like his dick and balls
can't smell great you,

1299
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:18,290
so he does it once every two weeks.
Yeah. And not only that, it's,

1300
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:22,240
it can give you infections
to UTI. Uh, you know,

1301
01:25:23,570 --> 01:25:24,380
they're not new.
Do

1302
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:28,610
together as a couple of years.
I would sit down, I'm serious.

1303
01:25:28,611 --> 01:25:33,200
I would go for this. I always say,
look, you know, I, you know, I love you.

1304
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:37,130
You know I'm with you. Yeah,
let's just talk about it. Yeah.

1305
01:25:37,131 --> 01:25:39,000
Why is she just straight up?
Yeah.

1306
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:41,960
Let's talk about what's going on and
he's going to be like, wait, what? What?

1307
01:25:42,530 --> 01:25:45,800
Let's just be straight up about it.
Just tell me so that I know,

1308
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:50,720
what is your aversion to showers?
Like what's going on, what's going on?

1309
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:53,910
And then he, he might be like,
no, I'd be like, no, no, no.

1310
01:25:53,930 --> 01:25:57,440
Like we've been together for a couple of
years. We lived together. So you know,

1311
01:25:57,441 --> 01:25:58,460
I'm in to you.
Yeah.

1312
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:02,180
But I just want to know and then maybe
you get a little bit under the surface.

1313
01:26:02,210 --> 01:26:04,610
See,
but I think if it is a psychological

1314
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:06,500
trauma or some kind of an issue,

1315
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:11,370
a lot of people don't even know what
that thing is consciously. The commerce,

1316
01:26:11,371 --> 01:26:14,780
like the conversation starter
is going to get something going.

1317
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:17,490
Can I tell you as a woman what I would do?
Uh,

1318
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:22,600
I think the trick is to get in with
dudes is sexual stuff and be like,

1319
01:26:22,761 --> 01:26:24,800
look, I love you. I want
to keep fucking Yale.

1320
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:27,880
I can't fuck you if your Dick
Smells. Yeah, that's true. I mean,

1321
01:26:27,881 --> 01:26:32,640
and you can also do the, if if reason
doesn't work, you can lead like,

1322
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:35,930
like basically set up that sex is
going to happen and he's like, yeah.

1323
01:26:35,931 --> 01:26:39,440
And they'd be like, look, go shop. But
see that's just going to get it done.

1324
01:26:39,570 --> 01:26:43,320
I know it's a long, I'm saying the
longterm discussion needs to happen. Like,

1325
01:26:43,790 --> 01:26:45,150
excuse me, like you're saying. Yeah,

1326
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:50,830
but she needs to maybe make an incentive
for him if he's not willing to,

1327
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:52,400
cause she says she's asked,
right.

1328
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:59,020
I think she needs to incentivize him
a little bit and maybe the sexist.

1329
01:26:59,091 --> 01:27:01,640
Yeah, I'd want to know. I'd be like,
oh, I really want to know what's up.

1330
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:07,550
Sounds horrible.
I mean that especially if he's exercising,

1331
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:11,450
that's really not cool.
Then again, there I just,

1332
01:27:11,451 --> 01:27:15,890
people who don't shower frequently,
who it's their thing.

1333
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:18,171
I mean,

1334
01:27:18,171 --> 01:27:23,171
I have relatives who are not big bathers
and I'm talking going days and days and

1335
01:27:24,921 --> 01:27:29,090
days and I, you know,

1336
01:27:29,091 --> 01:27:32,900
I don't know that hygiene man,
I got have it. I can't stand it.

1337
01:27:32,901 --> 01:27:36,200
If my hair is greasy and
I'm smelly or like I can't,

1338
01:27:36,201 --> 01:27:40,070
I can't be with someone like that. I
mean, thinking about your, your, your,

1339
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:43,010
your asshole and you're
digging balls and your badge.

1340
01:27:43,011 --> 01:27:47,360
Like to me not having a dirty
vagina is like, it's just, I can't,

1341
01:27:47,390 --> 01:27:51,960
I cannot, you know what I'm
saying? We'll dude's like, we know.

1342
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:57,260
No, you skip a day. What's
going on in your ball bag?

1343
01:27:57,650 --> 01:28:01,850
Of course you run that and you go, oh,

1344
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:06,590
you can smell it and nuts stink. Oh,
of course. I mean, same with women.

1345
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,180
It's just sweat. Yeah. I mean,

1346
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:15,060
you've got to get soap in
there. You got it. I mean,

1347
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:19,130
there's no way she can blow this
guy. There's no way. And again,

1348
01:28:19,190 --> 01:28:23,060
you can get all kinds of infections from
somebody who's not hygienic down there.

1349
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:27,020
You know, he's one of those guys, you
know sometimes you're out in public,

1350
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:32,740
you're in line at the grocery store and
all of a sudden someone walks by and you

1351
01:28:32,871 --> 01:28:36,260
go like, Oh yeah, I get
that. That be oh trail.

1352
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:40,010
You know where you go is so nasty.

1353
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:44,240
They walk around like everything's fine.
You pose a shit so nasty.

1354
01:28:44,241 --> 01:28:46,250
That's why people were put Julie,
they cover that shit.

1355
01:28:46,251 --> 01:28:49,010
I would that nasty oils and stuff.
I hate it too.

1356
01:28:49,011 --> 01:28:52,130
That's another thing I filled out there
for wife number two, no petroleum oil,

1357
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:55,790
no shower all the time, but she
does that. She was wife number two,

1358
01:28:56,270 --> 01:28:59,540
wife number two's got all kinds of
time cause she doesn't have a job.

1359
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:02,850
She doesn't really have hobbies.
She just likes to exercise.

1360
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:06,480
This was a, you know, another message
came in. It's pretty funny. Hey jeans.

1361
01:29:06,481 --> 01:29:09,540
After a busy morning I took
to my car to take a break,

1362
01:29:09,870 --> 01:29:12,840
reclined my seat and listen to
your mom's house while relaxing.

1363
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:17,880
I rolled the window down this beautiful
day and a miss listening to an edit of

1364
01:29:17,881 --> 01:29:22,080
Tom and friends in a gay orgy calling a
phone sex line. Remember that prank call?

1365
01:29:23,970 --> 01:29:25,800
I noticed through my rear view window,

1366
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:30,690
my female boss who was parked behind
me taking notice of the ungodly sounds

1367
01:29:30,691 --> 01:29:35,130
coming from my car after five to 10
seconds of clue listening to the phone,

1368
01:29:35,131 --> 01:29:37,830
sex call,
she got in her car and drove off.

1369
01:29:38,190 --> 01:29:42,600
I immediately laughed so hard at the
thought of her thinking about how I watch

1370
01:29:42,601 --> 01:29:43,680
gay porn on my breaks.

1371
01:29:44,930 --> 01:29:48,120
I have since run into her and the
Internet has yet to be addressed.

1372
01:29:48,150 --> 01:29:51,000
I want to thank the Mommy's for now
creating this unspeakable tension.

1373
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:54,060
We shall forever hold between us.
That's true.

1374
01:29:54,061 --> 01:29:59,040
Cause that that call was really graphic
really long too. Yeah. It was all like,

1375
01:29:59,041 --> 01:30:02,640
yeah, I fucking come on me, suck
Mike. It was really, really intense.

1376
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:05,840
It's pretty funny. Yeah. That's great.
You got to try to listen. You know,

1377
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:10,100
with ear buds. Yeah. I
guess roll your windows up.

1378
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:14,010
She's says jeans until the day I die.
The phrase,

1379
01:30:14,011 --> 01:30:17,820
try it out has been forever ruined.
I can't hear without fuck me,

1380
01:30:17,821 --> 01:30:19,680
piss on me and beat me going,

1381
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:21,930
running through my brain's
when test driving a new car,

1382
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:25,920
getting a new putter or the first time
my wife had been where this swaddle cloth

1383
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:29,700
with my new son. She asked if I
want to and utters that damn phrase.

1384
01:30:29,701 --> 01:30:30,810
I'm now holding my son.

1385
01:30:31,270 --> 01:30:33,990
All I can hear as a man asked me to
piss him off on him and beat him.

1386
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:36,810
I wonder if it's a first in human history.
Love you Andrew.

1387
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:41,250
We have room and try it out. I just
ruined for me. I mean, I say it just,

1388
01:30:41,251 --> 01:30:44,280
it'll come out and then I just, I started
laughing. What are you laughing at? My,

1389
01:30:44,281 --> 01:30:49,230
I just try it. I know so many
phrases are destroyed for us.

1390
01:30:49,650 --> 01:30:52,440
Yep. Uh, so when tells me to be careful,

1391
01:30:52,441 --> 01:30:56,060
I used to be carefree and scratching
my ass all the time. I got a,

1392
01:30:56,270 --> 01:30:58,870
then I got a deal. Science assist, uh,

1393
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:03,330
apparently scratched and broke the skin
a bit and allow bacteria to get in over

1394
01:31:03,370 --> 01:31:05,730
time and form assist.
I couldn't sit down comfortably.

1395
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:09,480
Had to have surgery to have it
removed and cleaned out. Yeah. Sorry.

1396
01:31:09,481 --> 01:31:13,990
This is from scratching too hard. Yeah.
Scratching the crack too hard. Yeah.

1397
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:17,570
You gotta go, he said he did
his finger just to the crack.

1398
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:21,900
Like direct skin skin. Well yeah, I
actually had one of those when I was 19.

1399
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:25,560
I had that, that system is
it from scratching directly?

1400
01:31:25,710 --> 01:31:28,950
I got mine from horseback
riding. Ah, fuck horses.

1401
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:33,120
I went horseback riding and I have
a hairy butt. And so you're like,

1402
01:31:33,150 --> 01:31:36,910
the whole time you were rubbing, you
know, like that. And then I was like, oh,

1403
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:39,320
this hurts.
And I showed it to a,

1404
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:44,710
it's actually a friend's mom who was a
nurse and she was like, you need to where,

1405
01:31:44,730 --> 01:31:49,140
where was it on your butt? The top,
very top of the crack. The middle,

1406
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:53,100
like at the very top. Sure. And then
I went and the guy was like, oh yeah,

1407
01:31:53,101 --> 01:31:55,980
you have this thing. And
assisted formed, you know,

1408
01:31:56,040 --> 01:32:00,010
started a forum and I was like hurt.
And he's like, yeah, cause uh, like it's

1409
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:03,480
infected now. I was like, oh, I
was totally scared. He gave me,

1410
01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:07,910
um, a, uh, what's it
called? Uh, uh, antibiotics.

1411
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,300
And that night,
that night,

1412
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:14,940
the cyst exploded,
but it did it in my sleep.

1413
01:32:15,550 --> 01:32:19,560
I just woke up and when I, when
I wake up, my buck, my box,

1414
01:32:19,590 --> 01:32:24,210
it had ruptured and then dry because
it was in my sleep were all crusty.

1415
01:32:24,211 --> 01:32:25,260
I'm like,
what the fuck?

1416
01:32:25,261 --> 01:32:30,261
And I take them off and there's
like dried blood and says no.

1417
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:34,140
It's just, it's like a little thing like
quarter, no smaller than that even. Yeah.

1418
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:39,090
Nicole. Yeah, I guess it
was all pus and blood.

1419
01:32:39,990 --> 01:32:44,670
Who's super nasty. Yeah. That's where
you want me to put my mouth? No,

1420
01:32:44,671 --> 01:32:49,110
below that. Lower on lower part
of you thinks that this is okay.

1421
01:32:50,110 --> 01:32:54,030
So he's telling you don't scratch so
hard finger is saying be careful because

1422
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:56,310
it's like the same thing as
the horseback riding. You know,

1423
01:32:56,311 --> 01:32:59,970
you can shoot everything. Yeah, sure,
sure. Guy. That's why I advocate.

1424
01:32:59,971 --> 01:33:04,440
If you've got a butt scratch,
just rub your finger over your underwear.

1425
01:33:04,670 --> 01:33:08,670
Do you know what I'm saying? Go through
the don't go under the underwear. Yeah.

1426
01:33:08,730 --> 01:33:12,510
Just scratch through your clothing.
Why? So what? Wash your underwear,

1427
01:33:13,410 --> 01:33:17,730
right? Sure. Don't touch skin to
skin and then your fingers all dirty.

1428
01:33:18,210 --> 01:33:20,040
Some of your Chinese get Terry.
That's what they're for.

1429
01:33:20,070 --> 01:33:22,840
Wore a all right.

1430
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:27,730
I got a try it out and we got to
try it out. Um, that's a gene.

1431
01:33:27,731 --> 01:33:31,870
What else you got? Anything else? No,
I think I'm good. I'm, I love you.

1432
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:33,660
I love you too.
Um,

1433
01:33:34,550 --> 01:33:37,960
we got to get y'all and I'm home.
I'm home here now.

1434
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:40,610
I'm hearing no piss on me.
Beat me home right now.

1435
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:47,830
I'm here. No piss on me. Beat me
home here. Now I'm homeless here now.

1436
01:33:48,230 --> 01:33:49,130
I think that's what he's saying,

1437
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:58,310
but I think you're right.
Come home. I'm home. I'm home.

1438
01:33:58,311 --> 01:34:00,170
I'm homing now.
I'm home right now.

1439
01:34:00,350 --> 01:34:05,240
I think so. I'm now all right.

1440

A Thompson.

1444
01:34:19,550 --> 01:34:24,270
Don't buy that syrupy on my line
or don't support time in this.

1445
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:27,750
Please support me in this.
Don't support this lunacy hygiene.

1446
01:34:32,940 --> 01:34:37,820
Oh, oh, nice.

1447
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:42,353
Oh,

1448
01:35:07,950 --> 01:35:11,040

Bad at all at all. At all.
