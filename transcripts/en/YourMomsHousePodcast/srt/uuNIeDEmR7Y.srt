We're supposed to give you a heads up.

14
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:03,300
do you want to go ahead and
start? I would do my dates. Sure.

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,290
Oh Dude, I big debts. Go see
Christina doing stand ups.

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,480
Now we're talking Lavalle and disrespect
on this show about my big fucking tits.

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,040
January 10th. You want to see
some big tits at the comedy store?

18
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,800
I only do that for you. You know,
I don't even think it's that funny.

19
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:29,620
I just do it for you. Doing that
January 10th I'm at the, uh,

20
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,700
main room on the main stage,
as Tom Likes to say.

21
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:37,190
Go ahead and give him what
I do on the main stage. Oh
yeah. You dance for dollars,

22
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,610
right? Your heels. That's why you
gotta wear your boots and your leg.

23
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:43,250
Exactly where it just to
regroup. Ah, everybody's,

24
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,650
that's the uniform of the horror is
what you said. No strippers, strippers,

25
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,270
they were there.
They're basically nothing in their heels.

26
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:56,600
But then when they're off work,
yeah, they were those like ugg boots,

27
00:01:56,601 --> 00:02:00,350
like the knee high, ugg
boots, the leggings and the
oversized sweatshirt. Yeah.

28
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:06,020
There you go. You got it
on. Got The uniform you got,
yeah. You're on. You're like,

29
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,820
ah, the slap. Yeah. Hours. Take a break.

30
00:02:09,821 --> 00:02:12,830
I gotta pay my cell phone bill. That's
what I feel like they're always doing.

31
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,130
Painting that cell phone. They always
have the cell phone bill. You're right.

32
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,690
Why is that always the
burden in a cell phone store?

33
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:21,710
There's always a couple of hookers
waiting to pay their bill. Yeah.

34
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,660
Are you really to have slight
culture down? So proud of

to say? Oh, maybe some international,

79
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,400

you serious? Yeah. You're going to go?

80
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,570
I think so. You have to renew your
passport. Well, I mean, I'll do that.

81
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,910
I did let it expire. It's
upsetting. I'm just reminding you.

82
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,110
You are reminding me and I appreciate
that and I appreciate you. I appreciate,

It's go time. You're ready? I'm ready.

85
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,643
Let's do it.

86
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,300
Thank you ma'am. I'll fuck with
clown. Look that up from Florida. Um,

87
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,910
I'm looking for my queen. Know what I'm
saying? Sean gotta be skin showing Barbie.

88
00:05:53,911 --> 00:05:57,470
Fetch. You can be anywhere between, you
know what I'm saying? I just need man,

89
00:05:57,471 --> 00:05:58,280
motherfucker Wiki

90
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,870
and juggle that look.
You know what I'm saying?

91
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,810
Oh, it's Randy. Don't bring anyone loving.

92
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,940
Well,
go to your mom's house

93
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:21,090
saying, you know what I'm saying? Just
talking about it. Yeah, I know. Funny.

94
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,020
It is funny. I feel like we
need that back in our lives.

95
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:27,190
We kind of phase it out for him and we
go through cycles. We did go through,

96
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:31,390
is this guy a Juggalo? Exactly.
Yeah. Your Fridge. I Collette. Yeah.

97
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,290
Yeah. From Queen. No, I'm saying, you know
saying yeah man. You know what I'm saying?

98
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,613
Well I'm saying,

99
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,660
I will say he's got some of the criterion
for a perfect your mom's house video.

100
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,800
Let's review. Sure. Well man motherfuck
would clown looks. I'm from Florida,

101
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,900
so right away. Okay.
Location, location, location.

102
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,210
Where is he located? He is in
a bathroom. C Tile over here.

103
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,640
I think he's might be on the toilet.
Yeah. It's probably taking a shit.

104
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,950
He is not wearing clothing on top.
No, and I don't. Does he have nipples?

105
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,660
Are they just tucked in somewhere?
I don't know. He's got he's,

106
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,090
he's got a horrible framing.

107
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,300
Terrible underneath 10 close to
came to see the top of his head.

108
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,710
It's framed forehead to mid chest.
It's from below beneath you,

109
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:23,850
which is never good. Yeah. Um,

110
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,380
also I will say the one thing that
doesn't meet the requirements. Yeah,

111
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,610
the lighting's decent. Why did decent,
I was going to say sounds not bad,

112
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:34,340
but I want to make sure,
I think there's some background,

113
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,980
either television or radio
on or there's something on,

114
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,220
here we go, man, my fucking
went clown La from Florida.

115
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

116
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,970
So I'm playing in the background
right there. Check. Sorry.

117
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:54,260
Ideal way to record something is always
to have other things playing in the

118
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:59,090
background for your audio.
Again. Yes, yes. And Queen.

119
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,420
No, I'm saying Sean Garden,
be skin showing Barbie Fitch.

120
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:05,480
You can be anywhere between, you know
what I'm saying? I just need some man,

121
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:09,470
motherfucker Wiki and juggle that look.
You know what I'm saying? If Yo, oh,

122
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,760
he's got a missing tooth up here,

123
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:15,680
well that goes without saying that all
of a sudden raises the points. You know,

124
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:19,830
like he was, there you go.
You were going to say? Yeah,

125
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,660
the lighting's pretty good,
but well I'm counting three,

126
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:26,090
maybe three that are gone from the top.
Yeah,

127
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,470
so that that does meet the
requirement. Sure. Three shop,

128
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,530
three top teeth are missing.
You get more points than three bottoms.

129
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,700
Why is that Tom? Well, it's like
you can, you can miss some bottoms,

130
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:41,270
hit someone with a smile and they might
not even realize it. You'll miss it.

131
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,800
That was the talk to you
for a while. I'm like, oh,

132
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,590
that guy doesn't have some bottom.
Sure you're missing top teeth.

133
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,240
People know right away. Oh, world sees
it. So that's kind of cool. Yup. Yup.

134
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,720
I'm also check check another box for the
unreasonable ask [inaudible] which is a

135
00:08:55,981 --> 00:09:00,780
huge part of a perfect why mh video and
his ask is to find a perfect woman for

136
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:04,650
him. He's a catch. Yeah.
Boy. He to his credit though,

137
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,230
you know he wasn't,
he was just like,

138
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,870
you don't have to be skinny and you
don't have to be fat. He was just like,

139
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:14,220
I want love. That's kind of actually nice.
That is neat. And yet to be a juggle.

140
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,450
Let,
well,

141
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:19,830
I mean that's somebody that's also smart
because what he's saying is I prefer

142
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:24,630
somebody who has similar interests.
That's really what he's saying, St. Cloud.

143
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,730
But at least he's not like, you know, and
you gotta be a doctor, like he's saying,

144
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,950
he's saying be would be into what
I'm into. That's smart, you know,

145
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,580
be into being a dumb shit.
Like Damn Shit.

146
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,360
Talk like I talk all dumb and Shit,
you know.

147
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,210
But he is, I think actually, you know,

148
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:48,770
maybe Kyle Dunnigan could learn if
a couple of things, his profile and,

149
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,730
and you know what I will say of all the
unreasonable mail requests for females,

150
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,730
this one is probably the kindest.
Yeah.

151
00:09:56,731 --> 00:10:00,420
He seems actually pretty nice that
we've had, have all our suitors. Yeah.

152
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,730
I might give this Juggalo a chance.

153
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,810
We had to rank Christine when just
done again, calling you Christine.

154
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,600
Thanks Todd. If we, if I could rank
my suitors. This guy is now at the top

155
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:18,390
of the tooth lists suitors.
Yeah. There's a number of them.

156
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,060
The whisper was probably the,
the worst.

157
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,200
That guy that was whispering into
his ladies. I was about to vomit.

158
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:28,620
We had no teeth when he was,
oh my God,

159
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,070
he was at singing to her and
he had the rotting teeth.

160
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,570
That was pretty bad. That
was the worst one. I,

161
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,160
but at least he wasn't a deck
like he was trying to woo her.

162
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,660
But the guy with the no teeth and
he's always watching television and

163
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,970
oh I can't I please,
why are you doing this?

164
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:55,120
[inaudible]

165
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,490
bad to these two fees.
Bad.

166
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,810
Cause if there's like a big crunch factor,

167
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,490
that's what setting you
off a little bit too.

168
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,630
Well and it's so up close to camera work.
They all have bad teeth,

169
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:26,120
but I don't have to see it so close.
It's true.

170
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,150
You might like whispering
and singing in her ear.

171
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,320
Yeah,
it's really,

172
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,300
yeah. Yeah. So you're saying that
bothers you some? That's the top.

173
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,000
The top, nastiest really.
Well I just, I don't,

174
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,360
here's the deal. Here's the deal, man.

175
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,430
That guy's nasty as to hate that guy.

176
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,510
But this guy will really insist
on romancing me and singing to me.

177
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,610
My favorite part,
my bad at all.

178
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,170
Whenever I talked to blue band
about these videos. This guy,

179
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,290
cause you know a lot of people, we
don't have names. Yeah. He'll just,

180
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:12,790
he'll blue blue bag just goes,
oh I got some more of the,

181
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:16,210
I'll make it calm guy. So he'll go, he
calls him the, I'll make you calm guy.

182
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,360
Even though we've played countless videos.
I'm like,

183
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:22,270
cause I always know what he's talking
about. I'm like I know that guy. He's

184
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,120
no, no, no, no.

185
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:30,470
We should do is when our guests gets here.
Yeah.

186
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,600
Let her see all these and then she has
to choose. Yeah, that's a good idea.

187
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:39,160
She will go with, well I got a
suitor that I want you to check out.

188
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:43,600
Actually no, just before she gets it.
Cause I want your real take on it.

189
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,990
Okay. So this guy, God,

190
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,110
he's having a conversation.
He's having a conversation right now.

191
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:57,310
We can't hear the other side of it, but
there's somebody actually talking to him.

192
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,580
So he's not making a recording as a pitch.

193
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,730
He's actually in conversation and we
have a recording of just his side of it.

194
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:11,500
You have to imagine what
the other is saying,

195
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:15,390
but it's, it really gets
going. I mean, just,

196
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,960
just imagine who's on the other side
of this and what they're saying because

197
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:21,280
here's what he is saying.

198
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,090
Okay?
You would be required to make daddy call.

199
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,220
Is that understood?
And it would be done in a way,

200
00:13:31,221 --> 00:13:35,960
but you want to do either with
your body or a friend of yours,

201
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,310
that's your girl, that you can sell it
with picture and say daddy stroke to her.

202
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,880
All right.

203
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,880
Or a video that you found or something
that you think will make daddy score,

204
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,770
but that is like a hundred
percent on your shoulders.

205
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,460
I trust that,

206
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:59,690
that my baby will know daddy well
enough to know how to get daddy to come.

207
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,170
That's a big responsibility for you.

208
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:09,960
How do you feel so far? You know that
scene we play when Josh Potter comes,

209
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,410
that woman crying. That's how I feel.
Really. I don't like that one at all.

210
00:14:14,411 --> 00:14:17,920
You don't like it? It's so gross,
Babe. What's the part you don't like?

211
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,200
Just the everything.
That guy's a scary

212
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,920
like it is making sure you're
always sage. No thank you. Secure.

213
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,920
Making sure your daddy's
there 24 hours a day for you.

214
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,580
Making sure you're not making
stupid mistakes. All right.

215
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,370
Make sure that your grades are good,
right?

216
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,720
You sure that your relationships in your
life are solved and making sure that

217
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:43,150
when you melt down and have a bad night,

218
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,000
I am there all night long with you.

219
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,930
Sounds like a little not healthy fantasy.

220
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,980
Hmm. I don't like it. Well here's
a neat thing now if you want,

221
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,540
look on the bright side,
he checks a lot of the boxes.

222
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,140
Have a great video for this show.
Background is horrendous.

223
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,710
The background is a disaster
and I think doctor drew,

224
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:11,600
if he were here would be like this guy
might have a little sense of delusion

225
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:13,210
going on. Lots of it. Yeah.

226
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,030
It doesn't appear that he has a headboard
or any kind of framing on the bed.

227
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,170
It doesn't look like he
has even a nightstand.

228
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,120
There are just boxes or books
and things on the floor.

229
00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:28,280
I need somebody in nightstands.

230
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,120
I mean where does he put like
his glass of water or his phone?

231
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,360
Like just a bunch of shit on the ground.
Uh,

232
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:39,200
he's lit from the computer
screen. Uh Huh. Um,

233
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,740
it's tear. At least he has a
shirt on, which is disappointing.

234
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,850
It's really disappointing.

235
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,590
Just this would be a rock and roll
hall of Famer if he were shirtless.

236
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,910
He has his teeth again,
bomber upsetting,

237
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:58,050
but he's uh, he's kind of much scarier
than the other guys. It's demonic and,

238
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,850
and it seems like he wants to own somebody
has the ask is, is really a lot. Yeah,

239
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:08,930
but you get that will
surpass any thing you've got.

240
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:15,260
Cause it's all conditioning.
It's not based on how you,

241
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,730
the stop based on your
performance intimately.

242
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:24,820
It's not based on your makeup before
your clothing or where you live or your

243
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,140
upbringing.

244
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:32,140
It's based on you being my baby and me
being responsible for making sure you're

245
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:35,900
always okay.

246
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,010
That seems nice.
All this to make him calm,

247
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,750
everything is related to coming.
Right. It's so elaborate.

248
00:16:43,751 --> 00:16:47,020
Like it's just to make him
calm. Never stops it. No.

249
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:55,520
Ah Yeah.

250
00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:00,580
Like do you realize how much energy this
man is putting towards getting what he

251
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:05,390
needs? Just to have a good
orgasm and he's not a young guy.

252
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:10,280
Here's a man that old, right? He's not an
elderly man in his fifties I'm guessing.

253
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,970
So is is coming really
that big of a priority.

254
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:18,770
It is interesting though
that the late like to him,

255
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:23,270
he doesn't want to go out to a bar and
and or sure reduced to a woman who could

256
00:17:23,271 --> 00:17:26,960
make them come because that
woman's not going to be at he,

257
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:30,670
he needs it to be a submissive,
he needs a baby. Yeah. Pacific.

258
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,610
And so he's got like a really interesting,
uh,

259
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,370
psyche and mind game that needs to happen.
Yeah.

260
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,900
This is definitely a drew thing. I
want to put this on the list. Yup.

261
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,620
Do you love the idea of having
the daddy there for you?

262
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,920
I'm going to fucking be here. Okay.
Okay. Can we stop this? Is there a

263
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:55,050
my time is with you. You got to take
care of Daddy's cock. Okie dokie.

264
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,430
I'm done. Thank you. It sounded like a
nice pitch for a second. It was like,

265
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,630
I'll always be there for you no matter
what. You know, all these things.

266
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:07,920
But then he, he, he tagged it with
you got to take care of Daddy's cock,

267
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,720
you know?
Okay,

268
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:15,330
this is what you need to decide because
I can't spend all my time with you.

269
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:21,570
Shut off every other baby
that's interested and then
not emptied on a regular

270
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:25,800
basis out.
There we go get emptied

271
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:33,470
talk and daddy will get hard
and you should send us that.

272
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,370
We'll know that and know, okay,
I need to fix daddy. Yeah,

273
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,680
it's real weird. So creepy. Why has
it got to be in the terms of data?

274
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:48,480
I can like it and his skin looks like
it's going to peel off and this does have

275
00:18:48,481 --> 00:18:52,710
bad skin, which again,
bonus, but you know,

276
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:57,030
it looks like really rang a shirt,
but you do have really bad skin.

277
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:03,000
It really enhances the look more
the part that daddy's got it.

278
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:08,060
I got out since this is daddy gets mad
at you for reasons I shouldn't be mad at

279
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:12,510
you. Dope. So this is where you
need to at least be mature enough.

280
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:16,070
Even any framing to accept
that responsibility,

281
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:19,950
to have that response except the rules.
The daddy was up for you.

282
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,800
Such a big responsibility.
What fucking website?

283
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,530
This is not how you normally,
uh, court people. Jeez.

284
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:32,940
I thought a Craig's list ad used to
suffice and this guy has got real demands

285
00:19:32,941 --> 00:19:35,100
happening. I mean, are you turned on?

286
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:40,860
I think my vagina just sewed itself shy.
It just imploded on itself.

287
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,390
How?
I don't understand.

288
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:44,910
I really don't have to know how these
people have so much time about what makes

289
00:19:44,911 --> 00:19:49,020
them come and the specific,
the specificity of what makes
them calm. It's like, oh,

290
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:53,310
come on. Just stop being fucking
weird. You know what I mean?

291
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:58,260
That guy's pretty weird. Oh,
he's so nasty, Todd. Yeah. Again,

292
00:19:58,261 --> 00:20:02,460
and he also does the same thing that
the four, the four stroke guy does,

293
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:07,380
where he repeats himself. He's like, you
have to make daddy can't, like, yeah,

294
00:20:07,381 --> 00:20:09,620
we know asshole. He careful it. Just

295
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,770
a hoard. Yeah. He, he keeps
repeating. If I got it, bitch,

296
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,030
that's how I feel. I think that was
the other side of the conversation

297
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:27,740
as he was doing it. He's
like, Daddy, come on,

298
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:34,110
kill myself. Listen. Yeah. Okay.
No, I don't like him anymore

299
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:43,460
because I can't spend all my time
with shuttle every other baby.

300
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:48,040
That's interesting. Yeah.
And then, yeah, you know, but

301
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,300
you know what that's like Tom,

302
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:53,590
when you're interviewing babies and they
all get your hard and none of them are

303
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:57,190
getting you off like you want and
you're like, which one are you?

304
00:20:57,191 --> 00:21:01,390
Babies is going to Jack my deck. And it's
so frustrating when they don't. Right.

305
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:06,700
It is frustrating. And I want you
to understand this is the agreement.

306
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:09,190
I'm going to be there for you,
but you've got a sense when I'm hard,

307
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,340
this is a reasonable thing. The
adult baby people, which we've,

308
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:17,130
we've featured before on your mom's house,
uh,

309
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,370
the woman who likes to be the
baby and then the guy you know,

310
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:23,140
pushes her around in a fucking
pram or whatever, they love it.

311
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,070
People love this stuff. That's true. Hey,
I'm guessing to, we didn't play all the,

312
00:21:27,071 --> 00:21:28,670
uh,
how,

313
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,160
how amazing Regena's
video affects face space.

314
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,160
Excite my mind's on the Christina
p right now on Instagram.

315
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:40,960
If you want to see the ones that didn't
get played. Kidding. No. Or at least one.

316
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:46,110
You want to see it? I ain't kidding
me. It's what I live for. Look, Julia.

317
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,430
That's terrifying. That's me as
Joe. That's extra terrifying. Yup.

318
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:57,400
Wow. Oh Jeez.

319
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:02,020
Did we play the urine
enema? We did. Right? Yeah.

320
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,670
Okay.
Rain.

321
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,230
I'm going to give myself a
urine anima. Um, people, uh,

322
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:15,930
are still continuing to send in
their look alike shops. You know,

323
00:22:15,931 --> 00:22:20,910
I get so many of Garth, no, no. People
who I look just like, oh, right. Yeah.

324
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,710
Tom Twin photos.
You know,

325
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:30,880
if you're not subscribing to
your mom's house on Youtube,

326
00:22:30,881 --> 00:22:35,560
please do so immediately so that you can
see these photos of people are sending

327
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:40,090
Tom photos. They're like,
you look just like this guy
happening. The story is this.

328
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:44,920
It's been happening. It's been
happening on Twitter, emails, Instagram.

329
00:22:44,921 --> 00:22:48,190
People were like, dude, my
fucking friend is your twin.

330
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,170
Or like my brother looks just like you
guys are exactly how your doppelganger

331
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:58,890
and what will be the same is that
it's a human male with facial hair.

332
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:03,820
The beard. Yeah. Well that guy, hey man,

333
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:07,750
we're twins.
They never do.

334
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:12,070
They never looked a little bit. I can see
why he had the dark circles under his,

335
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:15,490
I mean, but you're talking about
some features, but people are like,

336
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:20,020
you got to see this. Like you're going
to get freaked out. Okay, what is it?

337
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,130
There's a guy with a beard. I'm
like, okay. And I look exactly alike.

338
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,420
No we don't. He's got
hands. You got hand. Oh. Oh.

339
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,720
And these are just a bunch of
dudes and panties. Tight pants.

340
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,160
Which ones you again, the black guy. Um,

341
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,990
well that's where you're looking
at an hour. I know. All I know.

342
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:44,380
Talk to my shrink about
it. Clear. And uh, oh,

343
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,720
this one. I've gotten a lot. This Dj.

344
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:52,220
That one's reasonable von stroke. Yeah,
that's reasonable. It's reasonable enough.

345
00:23:52,221 --> 00:23:54,230
Especially when I'm in the DJ gear.

346
00:23:54,231 --> 00:23:58,820
So like here he's wearing sunglasses
and a hat and a black tee shirt and I'm

347
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:01,010
wearing sunglasses.
And a hat and a black tee shirt.

348
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,010
And we both have beers with
similar. All right. I get it.

349
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,720
But I mean come on most of the
time, which I mean, it's just a guy.

350
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:12,770
Yeah, it's not your twin. If it's
just a guy that doesn't work,

351
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,390
that's most people's criteria.

352
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:20,990
Some actress that plays Supergirl. I get
sent that one a lot. I'm like, all right.

353
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:25,940
Maybe if I was 20 years younger.
Yeah, man, I'm like way cuter.

354
00:24:25,941 --> 00:24:30,280
I think she's a little bit curious to me.
Mm hmm.

355
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,730
Uh, Ben Dover. Fuck. Um,

356
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:39,550
why don't you play that fucking daddy
calm guy? No, I'm all traumatized.

357
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,310
God. Yeah, I don't like that stuff, man.

358
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:48,110
Here's an email. Hey Tim
and Krista, I keep calling.

359
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,290
I keep telling Garth to fart on his balls.
Every Instagram post

360
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,720
I have even asked for his pay pal
so I can contribute to his cause,

361
00:24:56,721 --> 00:24:57,890
but nothing has gained.

362
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:02,390
Maybe once the mommy's get his attention
and he agrees to come on the podcast,

363
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:06,980
you can both fart on each other's balls.
That would be my dream come true.

364
00:25:06,981 --> 00:25:10,640
But what's wrong with you? Who's writing
this? Thanks for everything you do.

365
00:25:10,641 --> 00:25:15,420
Truly a mommy kiss on me and try it
out. Like code stroke, four times slept.

366
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,480
You guys,
Travis from British Columbia.

367
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,460
You think if we could
get Garth on the show,

368
00:25:19,461 --> 00:25:21,540
which would be a dream come
true that we'd be like this far.

369
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:25,910
Don't each other's balls. Yeah, of
course. That's what everybody wants to do.

370
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:27,200
There's no way that would happen.

371
00:25:27,201 --> 00:25:29,960
That's what everybody wants to do with
Garth Brooks. That's why he's so famous.

372
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:33,680
Don't you know he meets all of his fans
after his arena shows and then he farts

373
00:25:33,681 --> 00:25:36,760
on all their balls. Okay. Uh,

374
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:41,720
here's another email. Would it
do that? I would not. It says,

375
00:25:41,721 --> 00:25:43,070
Dear Tanya and Chris Stobo.

376
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:47,330
I'm messaging in regards to that Harry
boy who didn't like the toilet paper

377
00:25:47,331 --> 00:25:48,560
supplied by his college.

378
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:53,720
I was once in the same shoes as him
as a fair low hairy bear. Harry boy.

379
00:25:53,721 --> 00:25:58,721
I noticed the half ply bargain shop roles
would terrorize my tush and destroy my

380
00:25:59,181 --> 00:26:03,320
dupa. So I came up with a unique
and cost effective solution,

381
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,750
use the handicap showers.

382
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,810
There were no handicapped
folks in my dorm,

383
00:26:08,811 --> 00:26:13,100
so I would simply use the toilet
for my Duke. He's before showering.

384
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:18,130
Then simply use the handy dandy movable
shower head to spray a geyser of

385
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:23,621
pressurized water up my
Coolo thus cleaning my hairy
ass deeper than any toilet

386
00:26:23,841 --> 00:26:27,260
paper could ever dream
of. Try it out. Wa Hunter,

387
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:32,500
now they added more mois or something.
Brilliant.

388
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,610
Speaking of those,
um,

389
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:39,300
the Giulia full throttle stuff has
obviously gone full throttle. Um,

390
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:44,310
thank you so much for
the,

391
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,380
uh, the uh, shirt

392
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,250
purchased is everybody loved those.

393
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,420
The socks should be up now if they're
not checked back in a couple of days,

394
00:26:52,421 --> 00:26:56,900
they're good morning Julia
socks with the fan zone and,

395
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,780
and literally hundreds of videos come
in and we just can't play them all.

396
00:27:01,781 --> 00:27:06,400
But we did a few other selections here.
One thing before we continue on this.

397
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,150
Yeah, go ahead. Nothing
makes me happier in life.

398
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:15,180
I think in just in general as when
silliness is taken very seriously.

399
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,600
The fact that every now and
then you'll be like, oh my God,

400
00:27:19,601 --> 00:27:24,280
you won't believe how many people are
purchasing the good morning Julia or the

401
00:27:24,281 --> 00:27:25,420
full travel shirts.

402
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:30,940
And it makes me laugh so
much and it brings so much
joy to my heart because in a

403
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:34,420
world of just, you know
what I mean? Real stupid,

404
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,010
real things that something
like this taking on and, and
making people happy. Yeah.

405
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:42,490
That's great. It's just warms me.
Yeah, it's really great, right? Yeah.

406
00:27:42,491 --> 00:27:44,650
The show is so fun.
It's so stupid.

407
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,190
Find silly things and then get other
people excited. It's so exciting.

408
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,940
It's so exciting. That is, that
really is was people like, and we all,

409
00:27:51,941 --> 00:27:55,720
we're all in the same stupid joke. I just
like it. I like it too. I like it too.

410
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,830
It makes me laugh. Okay. What do we have?
Here's a couple more. Good morning, Joe.

411
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,980
It's me, Melissa. So
Darlene, you yesterday,

412
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:07,370
outside of the home depot was the greatest
moment of my life. There is a fight.

413
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:11,770
It's been sticking in my mind the way you
said that you were thinking about mark

414
00:28:11,771 --> 00:28:15,550
and another video for Giulia.
Go Raisa from your past.

415
00:28:15,551 --> 00:28:17,560
So Raisa from your memory,
you know,

416
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:19,750
sometimes we think somebody
is the right fit for us.

417
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,820
We meet them outside of a gym.

418
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,090
We exchange phone number as
we give off creepy vibes.

419
00:28:25,091 --> 00:28:27,580
But see myself having a future with you,

420
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:30,790
fallen in love with you and I

555
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:43,380
God or handyman store guy.
The chair,

556
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:47,550
he talks about so many dumb,
like listening to the list
now I'm like, oh my God,

557
00:37:47,551 --> 00:37:49,980
this guy is. But that's what he was
trying to impress Julia with. Right.

558
00:37:49,981 --> 00:37:54,780
It's both of it, but it's so
calming. Yeah. Like what are
you doing? They'd be like,

559
00:37:54,781 --> 00:37:58,830
keep talking. God, you
did the windows so hot.

560
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:00,603
Okay.

561
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:07,080
Right.
It's such a strange wooing tactic.

562
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:10,760
It really in his mind when
he lists all those, yeah.

563
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:14,860
What's going on on my
right. Turning you on. Yeah.

564
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:20,100
And that's his, but that's his angle.
He's like, look, I can't go for looks.

565
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,130
You know, he's not, he's not going to be
like on the hottest guy in town. Right.

566
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,070
I'm not the richest
guy in town. Right. Uh,

567
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:29,790
but I wake up really early and
I build a lot of shit. Right.

568
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,000
That's crazy.
He's crazy.

569
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,250
I really am excited.
Now

570
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:41,470
you get our guests to check out these
different men and get her take on them.

571
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:43,540
You know, I can't even imagine
what leave she's single.

572
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:46,030
Maybe she'll be interested,
you know,

573
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,730
she probably gets these in real
life. Maybe we can ask her. She,

574
00:38:49,731 --> 00:38:53,260
she's single and she's in the public.
I've heard dms are open.

575
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:55,630
There's definitely some
crazy shit going down.

576
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,560
She might actually seem like, oh, I
remember him. I know this guy. Yeah.

577
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:05,050
Yeah. Well it should be here.
She should be here momentarily.

578
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:09,760
Why don't we just take a quick little
break here and um, you know, we'll be,

579
00:39:09,761 --> 00:39:14,350
uh, we'll be right back and
might acuity power. Um, okay.

580
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:19,030
We're back. And you, you, you just said
you'll be careful not to kick the tripod,

581
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:23,260
but also we don't have to worry about it
because this is the last episode we're

582
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:24,790
doing here.
You're the last guest.

583
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,390
Okay. Yes. I would appreciate that.

584
00:39:32,391 --> 00:39:33,224
You don't do it.

585
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:36,920
It's not just because it's the last one
doesn't mean that it should keep still

586
00:39:36,921 --> 00:39:41,260
wobble. Wobble. Don't break
my shit. You're moving. Yeah.

587
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:46,160
Oh, have you showed people your news
sleep studio? They ever see any, oh dude,

588
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:50,330
it's so cool. Pretty slick stuff.
Neat state stuff. Raw stuff.

589
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,920
So exciting.

590
00:39:51,921 --> 00:39:56,750
You're lives are the greatest
lives of anyone I know.

591
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:00,320
And I'm just projecting everything
that I want your lives to be on too.

592
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,910
Slick stuff. Neat stuff.
Yes. That's Garth,

593
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:08,270
Garth Brooks one and only course.

594
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,740
How can I be relentlessly attack?
And it was like, he's so nice. Um,

595
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:13,883
you say that.

596
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:17,510
So you this and I thought this the
other day at the comedy store and then

597
00:40:17,511 --> 00:40:22,190
Christina is same. Same thing. He said
the same thing. You, I feel like you have,

598
00:40:22,191 --> 00:40:26,600
you're putting off very, my life
is good vibes. I get like that.

599
00:40:26,601 --> 00:40:30,140
You got your shit when
you have winter vibes.

600
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,340
I feel it. I feel good and a
lot of people tell me that,

601
00:40:34,341 --> 00:40:38,810
that they get that sense from me.
But, um, I am definitely on a,

602
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:42,860
I hope it's a trajectory cause I'm not
where I want to be yet. Like, you know,

603
00:40:42,861 --> 00:40:46,850
it's, it's an I'm going up
but, and so it's looking good,

604
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:51,350
but I'm not there yet. In terms of like
strictly career, you just mean in life,

605
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:56,440
in all, in all, in all senses, but
also career, career actually, I'm like,

606
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:59,570
I'm very happy. It doesn't
get any better. It's fine,

607
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:02,990
but it's definitely going to get better
because that's just where it's going.

608
00:41:02,991 --> 00:41:05,420
And that seems fine too. But, um,

609
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,140
I just remembered that when I saw you
the other day, but like a few months ago,

610
00:41:09,141 --> 00:41:12,530
he's like at the store and you're like,
I'm about to do this thing.

611
00:41:12,531 --> 00:41:15,640
That'll probably, I just can't. I
was like, what? And you're like, I'm,

612
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,670
and I was like, what does it, and it
was like the next day or two days later,

613
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,090
I saw an Instagram. I was
like, Nicki was on dancing.

614
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:27,910
It was so random. I'm like,
I know that come about.

615
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,630
I got a call from,
you know,

616
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:34,310
the call you get from your agent and
manager will call, call the double call.

617
00:41:34,311 --> 00:41:38,480
I got a double call right after I had
finished doing radio and a big offer and

618
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:39,050
they're like,

619
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:41,510
we're just calling you to go because I'm
making sure you're going to definitely

620
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,560
say 10% of both. I have never
even thought about it that way.

621
00:41:45,561 --> 00:41:47,330
I don't get many office unfortunately,

622
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,170
but it at a point in my career
where things are going well,

623
00:41:51,171 --> 00:41:53,960
when I get the double call, I know it's
going to be good news as opposed to bad.

624
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:57,390
No one is calling to drop me right now.
That'll come,

625
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,760
doesn't know where it goes away,

626
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,880
but they don't do a double phone when
you get old like 45 46 but then there was

627
00:42:03,901 --> 00:42:05,570
no double for the firing.

628
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:10,940
They pick one cowardly and sometimes
they don't tell you at all.

629
00:42:10,941 --> 00:42:14,360
True, true. That's another way.
But get dropped like that. Once

630
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:21,230
I got dropped by an agent who switched
agencies like they're just like, oh,

631
00:42:21,231 --> 00:42:24,290
he's gone. And I'm like, but it
doesn't even just send the, like,

632
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,200
I enjoyed my time working with you.

633
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:32,201
I'm moving to keep a connection there
where now and now you see them and you're

634
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:36,880
like, hey man. Oh, there's so many
people like that that just when you,

635
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,600
when you're coming up and you're nobody
and they treat you badly because you're

636
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:45,080
nobody, and then now they're not like
the most cliche thing, but it happens.

637
00:42:45,081 --> 00:42:48,500
You see it so much and I just go your
fake because you were mean to me last time

638
00:42:48,501 --> 00:42:52,100
and stub me. What's fascinating
is that it's always caught me.

639
00:42:52,101 --> 00:42:53,900
Now we're doing this a while,

640
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,110
but is that you go like that decorum,

641
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,340
that way of being like
treating someone is not,

642
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:03,080
it doesn't exist in any other business.
You know what I mean?

643
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:08,081
Like if you worked in finance or
sales and like a manager moves on,

644
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:12,560
you would call like your team and be like,
I enjoyed working with you.

645
00:43:12,561 --> 00:43:15,800
I'm leaving to work at this other company.
It's almost a form letter for that.

646
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,880
There's a way to that's conducting
business in that business.

647
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:25,130
But it's so funny, the rules
that we do all have to adhere by,

648
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:30,080
which is um, you know, managers don't
poach like a certain rules like that.

649
00:43:30,081 --> 00:43:32,600
They have their own stuff.
It's game on.

650
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:38,660
It's so weird to me that
there's this, it's, it's not,

651
00:43:38,661 --> 00:43:41,660
it's an unwritten rule,
but it's a rule that with managers,

652
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,080
you can't talk to another manager
if you currently have a manager,

653
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:49,010
but the agents don't adhere to that rule.
It's not the same rule.

654
00:43:49,011 --> 00:43:53,180
Why does that not go for both of us?
I think because the managers,

655
00:43:53,181 --> 00:43:58,181
except that they're supposed
to be your partner slash.

656
00:43:58,731 --> 00:44:01,040
Friend. Well, they're the
long haul. It's the long haul.

657
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:06,400
The agents except that it's a numbers
thing making money and it's more personal.

658
00:44:09,141 --> 00:44:13,220
It's family that's supposed to, that's
why I'm like, okay, well that makes sense.

659
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:17,190
The agents are fish,
dysfunctional family

660
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,120
and that's also the tactic is like we're
family now so that way they get away

661
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:26,540
with murder.
With ew gross business.

662
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:30,950
I recently had to leave someone
that I didn't have a problem with.

663
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:33,150
It was just like time to move on.
Yeah.

664
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:37,350
And nothing personal
note like it was so hard,

665
00:44:37,351 --> 00:44:42,351
but she handled it so incredibly just no
bitterness and you get worried in those

666
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:44,394
situations.

667
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:46,500
It's like when you break up with someone
in their main and you're like, oh,

668
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:49,900
I'm glad I broke up with you, cause your
announcers. But um, she was just like,

669
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,590
and I'm like,
you're one of the good,

670
00:44:51,591 --> 00:44:54,690
well I'm glad that I knew it was
such a thing. Made me feel so good.

671
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,430
She's smart because guess what?

672
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:01,470
I might come back or rent and people
change jobs and change all the time.

673
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:02,430
Yeah.

674
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:05,340
That's why I always tell people when
they don't get picked for this thing or

675
00:45:05,341 --> 00:45:07,950
that thing in our business,
it's like, dude, don't worry,

676
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,130
the gatekeepers change every few years.

677
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,100
If you don't get this thing now,
guess what,

678
00:45:14,101 --> 00:45:16,860
that person's going to go somewhere else
and that person's going to get hired.

679
00:45:16,861 --> 00:45:21,850
That might like you wait a little
bit longer and nice to every night.

680
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:23,410
Yeah.
He cool a

681
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:31,390
doorman who are executives of course
or Adam Devine's doorman became Adam

682
00:45:32,791 --> 00:45:37,200
divine. He was a doorman and
then Improv. Yeah. And know that.

683
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,320
But that's true. I mean like
anyone offer him, but yeah,

684
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:44,790
I hear he's doing all right. I think
he's, he's always been the sweetest.

685
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:48,240
Sweetest. Yes. Always the sweetest.

686
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:52,790
I that's the advice I always
give up and coming comedians. Um,

687
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:53,760
when they,
you know,

688
00:45:53,761 --> 00:45:57,750
they asked you for advice to the MC
is working for your or a guest set.

689
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:59,160
It's like, well, can I get some advice?

690
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:02,160
Which I'm always annoyed by it
because I never did that to anyone.

691
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,490
I never asked Comedians for advice.
Did you guys do that?

692
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,590
Did you ask them to watch your sets? Did
wise. Here's why I did it too though.

693
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:14,880
Phyllis Diller. All right, Phyllis fucking
day, but she was nice. She was old.

694
00:46:14,881 --> 00:46:16,860
I read her book and I was so inspired.

695
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:21,861
I sent her my set and I wrote her a letter
and fucking three days later Phyllis

696
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,100
Diller called me,

697
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:28,700
gave me notes on my act and it forever
changed what I was doing and everything

698
00:46:29,191 --> 00:46:32,250
changed for me. Oh my swearing.
She was the nicest lady.

699
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,210
That's so cool to shit at that point.
Super Sweet.

700
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:41,280
Very rare.
Accessibility in social media.

701
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:46,230
Hey Man, I did stand up for
the first time. No, no, no, no.

702
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:51,750
Do you have any ideas or feedback how I
could work on that makes the mask you're

703
00:46:51,751 --> 00:46:55,740
asking me to do right now.
I know once a week someone asks us that.

704
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:59,630
All of us that sends their first time
on stage, but I always still come.

705
00:46:59,631 --> 00:47:04,260
I was like, don't you know the classic
advice is do it as much as you can. Do it.

706
00:47:04,261 --> 00:47:07,710
Go anytime, go up anytime. You can
keep your eyes open to comedy around,

707
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:12,860
but I think essentially the best advice
to give a young comic is be cool to be

708
00:47:13,501 --> 00:47:17,820
around, have fun, hang, get the
comics. We'd, when they come to town,

709
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:21,750
offered a drive them places just be,
don't be annoying, but like, hey,

710
00:47:21,751 --> 00:47:23,430
if you need anything,
I'm your guy.

711
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:28,080
And just be cool because even if you're
a mediocre comic and there's better

712
00:47:28,081 --> 00:47:29,980
comics than, than you that
are annoying, I will bring you

713
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,230
on the road as a mediocre
comic that you're a funny,

714
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,600
if you're a finance and then
by bringing on the road,

715
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:38,440
you'll get to be great because you'll
get more stage time. So it's like,

716
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:43,420
just be cool that and observe the fucking
etiquette of comedy. For instance,

717
00:47:43,421 --> 00:47:45,310
if you're invited into
the headliners greenroom,

718
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:49,720
don't just bring your friends or your
girlfriend, mother fucking person.

719
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:55,120
Oh yeah, dive. We'll bring
like, what are you doing?

720
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:58,750
You're not invited a few friends with
them. I'm like, are you out of your mind?

721
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:03,920
This isn't yours. Yeah, no, that's,

722
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:09,220
that's your big one. I know you fucking
hate that. Or The chatty insane.

723
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:13,260
No Way. No, I emceed shows. I would never
be like, hey guys, come back with me.

724
00:48:13,261 --> 00:48:15,300
And the would never occur to me.

725
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:18,820
I would never even stepped foot in the
green room without like, I'm sorry.

726
00:48:18,821 --> 00:48:23,230
Can I do this? Yeah, I'm still
working in clubs. So it's like having,

727
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:28,150
you know the gray, you walk, you go to
a place in the green room is the author.

728
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:33,050
Oh, I've done, and I know you're
talking about grand rapids.

729
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:37,330
We were there together. I was just
thinking about you. The Bob, uh,

730
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:41,260
they're walking Hyenas Dallas hole.
That is,

731
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:45,130
you are the way,
literally fax going on,

732
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:50,140
but there's like still have fax.
Yes.

733
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:55,030
Oh yes. I lost my mind. Oh my God. Oh boy.

734
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:59,520
On the shot contest. So for people that
don't know, this was the crazy part too,

735
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:01,420
is that the MC goes up,
does 10,

736
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,840
the feature does 20 and kills.

737
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,710
And if you are headlining a show,
you go, I want to ride the wave.

738
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:12,910
Like this is what he's supposed to
do. He's setting up the show. They go,

739
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:16,540
all right. And you're like, all
right man. Great. Bring me up first.

740
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:21,340
We're going to do the blowjob
shot contracts, the craziest,

741
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:26,610
and then they brought a table on stage
setup shots brought up four people hands

742
00:49:27,161 --> 00:49:31,750
behind their back, put your mouth over
the shot, hot back. All right. So I go,

743
00:49:31,751 --> 00:49:35,350
hey man, could you not do that again
all weekend? And he's like, why?

744
00:49:35,351 --> 00:49:37,720
And I was like, cause it's terrible
and I don't want to be a part of it.

745
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:42,820
And he's like, we always do it. I
go, I know, but I don't want anyone.

746
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:45,940
He's like, you're the only person that's
ever complained. I go, no, I'm not.

747
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:49,450
I'm the only person that's ever
complained to you. I go, everyone,

748
00:49:49,451 --> 00:49:52,330
I'm sure it talks about it
and he's like, uh, I just,

749
00:49:52,331 --> 00:49:54,280
I don't know why you're so upset about it.
I'm like,

750
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,580
because you're ruining the show.
I go, if you insist on doing it,

751
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,910
how about you do it between
the MC and the feature?

752
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:05,170
Kill the momentum of the
show. This guy was like, man,

753
00:50:05,171 --> 00:50:07,060
you're really like fired up about this.

754
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:09,610
Then he brings in the other guy and
the guy's like, well, here's the,

755
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:10,780
here's why we do it.

756
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:15,970
And then you left because the
people who are doing their shots,

757
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:20,971
they each pay like 50 bucks to do that
to like be part of the show and do a shot

758
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:26,350
and so it, it pays for my MCC all
week. Someone I'm like, I don't care.

759
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:27,773
Hit

760
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,340
$50 a person. I'm like,
all right man. I go,

761
00:50:31,341 --> 00:50:35,570
well I just want you to know how
much I hate that you do this.

762
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:39,170
And he's like, okay, all right.
Because he kept doing it.

763
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:43,720
They, they are so stuck in their ways and
when you ever try to inject like, Hey,

764
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:47,290
I do this for a living and
I had a different and other
places and I've seen the

765
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:49,720
way it works and it works
better when you do it this way.

766
00:50:49,721 --> 00:50:54,190
Like something as simple as when
they start a show and they're like,

767
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:56,970
give it up for your, and like, are
you guys ready to have fun tonight?

768
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,470
Give it up for your headliner.
Nikki Glaser, first of all,

769
00:50:59,471 --> 00:51:02,680
I don't like when they go, she's in the
building. Let her here, she's backstage.

770
00:51:02,681 --> 00:51:07,010
I'm like, don't tell them where I am. You
can do better than that. Oh, I actually,

771
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:11,080
oh my God. I tell them to say
that I do. I tell the emcee, I go,

772
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:15,040
I'll get them to do a second
round because I, it's never like,

773
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:18,160
it's never not enough.
There it is. Like I like,

774
00:51:18,161 --> 00:51:20,590
I like that you can do better
when I'm about to be brought up,

775
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:23,260
but in the beginning of the show,
before the MC ever comes up,

776
00:51:23,261 --> 00:51:24,790
they go give it up for
your hedler Nikki Glaser.

777
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,420
Everyone thinks I'm coming to sage.
There's a huge applause, right?

778
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:29,980
Because a lot of people haven't been to
comedy shows, don't know how it works.

779
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:32,450
And then they go through the
whole roster and they go, yeah,

780
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,730
and you're featured act and it's like you,
they don't know who this is.

781
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:36,783
Stop acting.

782
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:41,860
A little shout out to our sponsor
is a Hampton Inn and the limo guy,

783
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:45,280
but it's just so awkward to sit across
from my feature in the green room who had

784
00:51:45,281 --> 00:51:47,920
just heard crazy applause for my name
because that's who they came to see.

785
00:51:47,921 --> 00:51:51,310
And then they have to put grudgingly
and then he already, he feels weird.

786
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,040
And so I've told them,
just can you just say the headliner,

787
00:51:54,041 --> 00:51:59,030
but like they'll meet him. Have you
played the clubs where they prerecord it?

788
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:02,200
They, they have, they have the, uh,

789
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,820
headliners name recorded, but they
don't know who their MCS, so it'll go,

790
00:52:05,821 --> 00:52:09,150
it's a prerecorded to go
and give it up for your Mc.

791
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:12,680
And that's it. The MCS, like

792
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:15,950
Emma and they walk up and they're like,
oh,

793
00:52:15,951 --> 00:52:18,770
we didn't record your name and who
didn't know who because my God,

794
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:23,950
that's the only more horrible thing is
when they have the pre roll to the whole

795
00:52:23,951 --> 00:52:24,784
event.

796
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:27,560
Now are you ready for this?

797
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:33,460
The clips from like Wayne's
world and you're like, I get it.

798
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:37,700
And there's like Billy Madison and
then mighty ducks. I'm like, yeah,

799
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:41,120
what are you pulling from? I have the
best one. There's two gray ones. Okay.

800
00:52:41,121 --> 00:52:43,850
There's the comedy zone in Jacksonville,
Florida,

801
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:49,150
or it's brilliant down the twilight zone
theme and then the strobes. And then

802
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:50,570
there's lawyers,

803
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:54,760
20 people in a room when
you are not drawing.

804
00:52:54,761 --> 00:52:58,270
And that kind of bombastic opening.
Yeah.

805
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,310
I can't see my Nachos. Yeah, we can
skip that tonight guy. There's 20 people

806
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:07,530
don't eat it. So my favorite by
far is when there's female act,

807
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:11,780
there's a side splitters
in Tampa, Bob, Bobby jewel,

808
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,020
and they,

809
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:17,600
they run a montage of women's
stripping and movies and they're like,

810
00:53:17,601 --> 00:53:20,780
you can't leave. Y'All had
her home. That's the song.

811
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:25,500
And it's a montage like Demi Moore and
the stripper movie and this chick and

812
00:53:25,501 --> 00:53:26,460
that chick stripping

813
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,250
and welcome to the stage Nikki Glaser.
And you're like,

814
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:33,950
they just saw a fucking montage of women
with their clothes off and now they're

815
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:38,810
expected to respect me telling them
jokes. Oh, have you ever, you're sober.

816
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:43,850
They s that I would hate that so much
because I hate being sexualized on stage

817
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:49,880
by the audience in any way. Worse. It
happens and usually it doesn't happen,

818
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:53,650
but anytime you take off your jacket it,
someone's going to know.

819
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:58,020
Even if a guy does it, I have
to say, but I will literally go,

820
00:53:58,021 --> 00:54:02,280
I'm about to take off my jacket.
Will you guys please not go whoa,

821
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:07,170
like no one can. We all agree
to not, I just hate it a lot.

822
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:12,480
I just begged them and they can't not
do it. I love it. They can't not do it.

823
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:16,590
And then I feel weird because I feel like
I'm trying to be sexy and then I feel

824
00:54:16,591 --> 00:54:19,440
like vulnerable in this way.
It makes you feel any better.

825
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:21,450
They do the same thing to me.
That's what I was going to say.

826
00:54:21,451 --> 00:54:23,320
I think they do it to men too.

827
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:28,160
And because of the like to me when
they're doing it, they're like woo. Yeah.

828
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:33,460
Yeah. Anna, because of this podcast,
every time I take a sip of water, oh,

829
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:36,800
just a round of applause. Cause it
was the water champ of our fell. Yeah.

830
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:37,890
And that's bananas,
not the,

831
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:42,720
I actually enjoy that because I am the
Watertown inside joke, but yes. But yes,

832
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,340
and every show I go to, like even
in theaters they go like burns fat,

833
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:50,940
the yell it. Alright. Hey Larry Bear.

834
00:54:50,941 --> 00:54:54,630
They yelled at at my shows to kind of say,
he's like,

835
00:54:55,190 --> 00:55:00,100
oh they just, and racist cars.

836
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:01,580
You're comes barging in here.
Yeah,

837
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:05,630
right on time. Well done Bert. Thank
you very much. I'm feeling fantastic.

838
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,473
I hundred percent sober.

839
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:09,950
I know giving up drugs and
alcohol entirely and I'll
never go back and I believe

840
00:55:09,951 --> 00:55:12,440
I'm supposed to introduce you as
the world's most racist comedic.

841
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:21,940
Thank you for sending that.
And I think that is a 98 uh,

842
00:55:21,941 --> 00:55:26,680
FM and a Phoenix. Nice. Wow. I think and
he didn't thought that would be funny.

843
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:32,790
Really caught on.
And then he said that newspaper

844
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:36,580
right to get a call about and then,

845
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:39,100
and then what really
happened that made us like,

846
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,080
we just started blocking anyone that did.

847
00:55:41,081 --> 00:55:43,570
It was can you just had to
because there's no fixing.

848
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:47,860
It was a news outlets started going.
What's the story here? It was a story.

849
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:51,970
Here's a follow me details.
I want to go live with this.

850
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,473
Okay.

851
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,300
Nothing more fun than torturing
everywhere. When I did radio,

852
00:55:59,301 --> 00:56:03,380
when I was in a Philly, those, I
forget the Guy President Steve. Yeah.

853
00:56:03,381 --> 00:56:07,700
They were like, what's up
with bird? You're like, well,

854
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:12,560
what's that?
That's really caught fire and happier

855
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,610
bird is the most racist fat comedian.

856
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:20,430
Okay.

857
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:22,970
Yeah. There you go. Hey,
really? Really? Yeah,

858
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,450
it's just glad that I'm glad it's getting
out. You know, because it's important.

859
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:29,920
You know the Louie stuff,
everyone was like,

860
00:56:29,921 --> 00:56:33,460
we've always heard whispers of it and
now everyone knows we can all talk about

861
00:56:33,461 --> 00:56:35,140
it.
This is the bird is fat and racist thing.

862
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:40,000
It's been whispered about for
years and now everyone knows.

863
00:56:40,001 --> 00:56:41,230
It's kind of cool.
Hey

864
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:46,330
single right now we have a
lot of single men, suitors,

865
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:47,620
suitors.

866
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:52,620
Oh I need to get your take
and maybe what's working,

867
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:54,590
what's not,
who you're into,

868
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,970
who we could maybe connect you
with if you're interested. Yeah,

869
00:56:57,971 --> 00:57:01,610
so I'll give you a few.
You tell me like turned on.

870
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,230
Do you want the number of digits?

871
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,580
Scale of one to 10 also want
the followup on Baguette.

872
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:10,670
I didn't forget last time you
told us about baggage. Oh,

873
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:14,050
why you said I have so much
to tell you guys. Okay,

874
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:17,270
well don't forget to tell us and that
bag as well. Bag It, you told us.

875
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:18,770
Here's what the story was.

876
00:57:18,771 --> 00:57:22,520
The last story was this
baguette is a comic in New York.

877
00:57:22,521 --> 00:57:25,940
That's your nickname for somebody and
you were like friends and you guys would

878
00:57:25,941 --> 00:57:29,930
always like jokingly, I, you know,
kind of flirt and then you were like,

879
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:34,280
let's hook up. And then he made some
excuse or something and then you're like,

880
00:57:34,281 --> 00:57:36,050
so what's up with that?
Like what was he thinking?

881
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:39,290
And then that's how we got
to know. We just, we just
guessed, we didn't know. Right.

882
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:44,230
I'm curious. You didn't know
that we've, that you don't
know the next step. No. Did,

883
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:47,140
nothing had happened with that though at
that point. At that point you were like,

884
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:51,750
he left me high and dry.
Okay. We hooked up. Ah,

885
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:57,390
then I hooked up and so,
okay.

886
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:02,430
This, it was, um, I, I was
so frustrated this night.

887
00:58:02,431 --> 00:58:05,190
It was like one of the best
nights of my life, career wise.

888
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:08,400
And I was like the Belle of the ball.
And I'm at a party and he's there too.

889
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:12,030
And I'm like, we're both in a different
city and we're staying at the same hotel.

890
00:58:12,031 --> 00:58:15,300
And I'm like, I look great,
greater than I will ever look.

891
00:58:15,301 --> 00:58:19,560
I'm peaking that night and he's just
kind of like milling about the party and

892
00:58:19,561 --> 00:58:23,340
we're making eye contact here and there
and being like, hey, you know, but it uh,

893
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:26,280
it just, he just was talking
to everyone else but me,

894
00:58:26,281 --> 00:58:28,050
I'm sitting alone at this party.

895
00:58:28,051 --> 00:58:31,440
It's tort near the end of the night and
there's this girl sitting next to me and,

896
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:36,960
and I'm like this, I was like, I that guy
over there, like we have been flirting,

897
00:58:36,961 --> 00:58:39,540
I've like got a semi kind
of a Dick pic from him.

898
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:42,150
Things are happening and he will
not come talk to me. Like, look,

899
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:44,550
he's talking to some two guys that
he doesn't even know. I'm like,

900
00:58:44,551 --> 00:58:47,580
what's going on? And she's like,
honey, if you can't get laid tonight,

901
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:48,780
none of us can.
I was like,

902
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,960
I know I'm wearing this dress
and like I'm dressed to the tens.

903
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:54,510
Like I'm just as cute as I can let,
I did TV that night.

904
00:58:54,511 --> 00:58:57,810
Like it's impeded your hair
and done and do better.

905
00:58:57,811 --> 00:59:00,900
And I was the Belle of the
ball for this thing that I did.

906
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:04,300
So like everyone at the party is
celebrating the things that I do.

907
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:09,150
It's like my words her, it's her Bat
Mitzvah. Yeah. It just felt like that,

908
00:59:09,151 --> 00:59:13,980
you know, like, and I felt like the Prom
Queen Watch that tripod. I, oh gosh,

909
00:59:13,981 --> 00:59:16,200
I gotta Watch the tread. Very. Um,

910
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:19,740
so finally we make eye contact
and I kind of give a look like,

911
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:23,330
what are you doing at this point? I've,
I've been bitching about him to this girl.

912
00:59:23,331 --> 00:59:26,840
I'm all worked up and I'm like, I'm
done playing it. Cool. I just go, yeah,

913
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:31,160
I flag them in. I go
get him, come over here.

914
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:35,420
Any comes over. And I'm like, what are you
doing? And he's like, I don't know man.

915
00:59:35,421 --> 00:59:38,330
I don't know. And then I'm
like, city or talk to me.

916
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:40,580
So we talked for like 20
minutes and then he's like,

917
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:43,310
I'm going to go and I'm like, I'm going
to go to, and I'm like, Oh my God,

918
00:59:43,311 --> 00:59:47,450
I'm going to get like I'm about to go
hook up for the first time in like ever

919
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:52,510
like forever sober having like I'm going
to maybe like get laid tonight and it's

920
00:59:52,731 --> 00:59:55,580
like going to be a one night thing and
it's just going to be fun. I was like,

921
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:59,540
yeah, and listen, I will add,

922
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:02,720
my rule for myself right now is not to
like bang people like I don't want to

923
01:00:02,721 --> 01:00:07,280
have penises in my vagina because it
just get too attached and everything and

924
01:00:07,281 --> 01:00:11,390
I'm sober and videos, but keep
going. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

925
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:16,780
So my rule is though and can always be
convinced if you get me worked up enough,

926
01:00:18,411 --> 01:00:22,520
I'm going to be like, oh, we need to
bang right now. Right. The guys like,

927
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,850
let me just put the tip in and then
you're like, I'm suddenly like, okay,

928
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:28,670
like if I want to have sex,
I'm going to have sex,

929
01:00:28,671 --> 01:00:32,300
but I just need to be convinced and boy
I can be convinced when I get horned up.

930
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:35,990
There's just, my brain doesn't
function like making logical choices.

931
01:00:35,991 --> 01:00:38,750
I just want it real quick.
Yes.

932
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:43,190
A lot of men listen to this show
types of questions to get you.

933
01:00:43,191 --> 01:00:47,300
Is it conversation? Should they,
is it like just great chemistry?

934
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:51,370
Do you point to anything in particular?
We have to have a little bit of a flirty,

935
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,320
flirty history. I'm like,
there's gotta be a little,

936
01:00:54,321 --> 01:00:55,610
it's not going to be a one night thing.

937
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:58,220
There's going to be a little bit
of texting, flirting, going on,

938
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:02,090
and then in person play the long game.
Not Super Long,

939
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:06,080
but you have to acknowledge that
you are desperate to bang me.

940
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:08,540
I think that's just like,
I like nice things.

941
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:13,130
I like to feel women just want to feel
desired. Just make me feel like I,

942
01:01:13,131 --> 01:01:16,500
there's something special about me that
you want me more than other people. Like,

943
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:19,550
even if it's a lie, just you know
what, just make me feel special.

944
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,830
Make girls feel like,
uh,

945
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:25,220
the woman in the long December
counting crows song all at all,

946
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:29,840
at once across a crowded room. You see
the way the light attaches to a girl,

947
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:33,710
like make me feel like I'm the girl in
the middle of a room that you just see

948
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:35,000
that's how girls want to feel.

949
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:39,890
Then in terms of like hooking
up to get to have sex with me,

950
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:44,690
we need more foreplay. And I feel
so cliche saying that as a woman.

951
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:48,410
Like I feel like a 90s lady,
like more foreplay honey.

952
01:01:48,411 --> 01:01:51,500
Like it's almost like it's,

953
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:55,550
it just doesn't feel good to me to say
that, but it's, it just is true. Like we,

954
01:01:55,580 --> 01:02:00,440
I need more. I just have a lot of times
guys going into soon where I'm like,

955
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:01,161
I'm not ready.

956
01:02:01,161 --> 01:02:06,050
And that is the equivalent of like a girl
grabbing your limp Dick and being like,

957
01:02:06,051 --> 01:02:09,860
come on and like you don't like,
like I'll let you know when I'm ready.

958
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:15,170
Just split. Let's dry hump, bring
back dry humping some over the genes.

959
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,860
Finger action. Right. There you go.

960
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:24,450
I'm no, no. As a mother of two busy,
I got a lot of shit on my roster.

961
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:28,830
I like to get in. I like to get out.
I like getting in and getting out too,

962
01:02:28,831 --> 01:02:33,060
but when you're in my shoes though,
do you relate to like a little bit?

963
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:36,840
If I were a single gal, here's the
thing. As a mother of two young children,

964
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:39,910
the window for Gnocchi is so narrow.
Chubb,

965
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:43,650
it's like I know when it's coming
because I know we got it on the calendar.

966
01:02:43,651 --> 01:02:46,200
We're going to do it tonight's the night,
so I'm thinking about it all day.

967
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:47,101
I'm like,
all right,

968
01:02:47,101 --> 01:02:50,430
we're going to have I to put the kids
down and then I got this the window.

969
01:02:50,431 --> 01:02:53,700
We've got to do it.
So I'm already thinking about it all day,

970
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:58,350
so when it's time go time, I'm like,
but even though let's pork, man,

971
01:02:58,351 --> 01:03:00,370
let's fucking fuck.
I don't want to fuck around.

972
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:04,860
In defense of what you're saying,
yeah. I'll still be like, hey,

973
01:03:04,861 --> 01:03:07,770
you want to warm it up a little bit?
You got to do what?

974
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:10,890
You have to warm up the oven
and, and, and I agree that's a,

975
01:03:10,891 --> 01:03:14,880
that is nice to have someone who's
attentive to that kind of stuff. Yeah.

976
01:03:14,881 --> 01:03:18,570
I just want to be begging you to put
yourself and make sure I don't want you to

977
01:03:18,571 --> 01:03:22,480
be like, let's go and me go.
Okay. I want to be like bleed.

978
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:27,690
Sure. And um, and so I was hooking
up with this guy. We got back to,

979
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,420
we went back to our hotel,
we're on the same floor.

980
01:03:30,421 --> 01:03:33,810
Our hotel rooms are back to back.
Wow.

981
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,980
Hotel rooms are right next to
each other. Perfect. I'm like,

982
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:40,310
I want to go to his because mine's a mess.
Like I like a slob on the road. Right.

983
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:44,910
Um, he's like, I have a buddy
staying with me and I'm like, oh man.

984
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:50,040
Like I want to look up, but I really, my
room is disgusting. And so I just am like,

985
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:52,740
give me a second,
let me go in and I'm throwing things now.

986
01:03:52,741 --> 01:03:56,460
How disgusting do you get?
Like you leave the room service trays.

987
01:03:56,790 --> 01:04:01,790
Are we talking coffee mugs and next to
the bed rappers in bed and stains on the

988
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:04,870
like cause I eat in bed so it just
looks like too, I get chocolate.

989
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:08,730
So it's like I'm shitting in bed, cross
town. I don't even flush the toilet.

990
01:04:08,731 --> 01:04:12,450
Sometimes there's like p
and saving the environment,

991
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,340
leaving

992
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:24,880
on vacation, cleaned my
room, meet who, what's up

993
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:31,890
at the emotional
work week in a hotel.

994
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:33,690
It looks like there was a robbery,

995
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:39,060
possibly could have been multiple
salts in the room, like a shelter.

996
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:42,440
It looks like it should be on for
like 48 Frat guys live in there.

997
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:47,400
Take a photo for a magazine that is,
I relate to,

998
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:50,580
I haven't related to something more
and it really want them something so

999
01:04:50,581 --> 01:04:55,581
specific and I tip wildly if you're
cleaning my room at the end of the week.

1000
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:59,610
Yeah, me too. You're getting a lot.
Even when I was a contract I was like,

1001
01:04:59,611 --> 01:05:03,610
here's like, oh wait. Yes,
because it's gross to clean up.

1002
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:07,200
And I tried to do a little good job
of tidying for the maid. But yeah,

1003
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:11,450
and so I went in there and I missed a
couple of things. I think there was like,

1004
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:16,410
uh, uh, my, I left like out my vibrator
type thing when he left. I was like,

1005
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:21,010
ah, it was like our, and I'm sure he saw
it, but who cares now? And he's like,

1006
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:23,620
we should put that in there. Let
me ask you something, when you,

1007
01:05:23,621 --> 01:05:24,910
if you travel with that,

1008
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:29,210
is it in your checking bag or are you
doing a carry on with that in it? Um, it,

1009
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:30,250
I don't have a vibrator.

1010
01:05:30,251 --> 01:05:33,880
I have this thing called the womanizer
and it like sucks your clit and so it

1011
01:05:33,881 --> 01:05:37,420
doesn't, if it turns on it's not going to
be an embarrassing sounds. What a name.

1012
01:05:37,421 --> 01:05:41,830
I don't like the way. No, it's the worst.
So can I make it something fun? You know,

1013
01:05:41,831 --> 01:05:44,290
women like Hello Kitty,
that's a huge thing. Yeah.

1014
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:49,030
Hello Kitty vibrators because it
takes the nasty out of it. Any Nicer?

1015
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:50,440
No, I know, I'm sorry.

1016
01:05:50,441 --> 01:05:55,441
So you put that in your carry on or
that goes in your throat checked.

1017
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:00,010
But I would put it in my carry on button.
But no,

1018
01:06:00,011 --> 01:06:04,450
she ain't have no shame because if it
turns on, it's like very like if, yeah,

1019
01:06:04,451 --> 01:06:08,710
I don't care if someone says it looks
like an ear thermometer, say touches it,

1020
01:06:08,711 --> 01:06:11,740
that's not gonna. I would laugh.
I will actually enjoy that.

1021
01:06:11,741 --> 01:06:15,310
If a TSA agent had to open it up and be
like, ah, I'd be like, it sucks my clit.

1022
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:17,930
Like I would just say that to his face.
Like very mad about faculty.

1023
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:21,430
You just have a story out of it.
Same, same along the same lines.

1024
01:06:21,431 --> 01:06:26,410
I was traveling with my breast pump also.
Very sexy, very sexy, and I was like,

1025
01:06:26,411 --> 01:06:30,790
Oh God, what have Tsa opens it and touches
it with her fucking dirty. Yeah, yeah,

1026
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:35,110
yeah. That is gross. Uh, check stuff.
You mean? No, carry on. Because it's a,

1027
01:06:35,111 --> 01:06:38,530
it's a device. It's sensitive devices.
Yeah. But even if you check it,

1028
01:06:38,531 --> 01:06:40,090
sometimes they rummage
through your bag and you know,

1029
01:06:40,091 --> 01:06:44,520
you get that note that's like,
I know because it's, yeah.

1030
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:49,450
Yeah. I travel with my scrum master and
I lot of times I'll see them touch that.

1031
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:52,050
Yeah. What do you travel? Do you
travel a scram? Master. Yeah.

1032
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:57,550
Did you put it underneath and it goes
like right in your ass and then it comes

1033
01:06:57,551 --> 01:07:01,210
back up and the vibration goes around
the head. Kate. Okay, go ahead.

1034
01:07:01,211 --> 01:07:03,740
And is that a real thing? No.
Oh my God, it sounds great.

1035
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:09,520
My Ass Brown.

1036
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:10,920
The vibrator was,

1037
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:14,820
you realize you love womanizer
and then we just start making out.

1038
01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:17,940
We get to work and um,
I have this new, I like,

1039
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:21,450
I really am going to need to be
convinced before I do anything to him.

1040
01:07:21,451 --> 01:07:22,320
Like I'm getting,

1041
01:07:22,321 --> 01:07:25,710
I need to get some stuff done or at least
see the promise that something's good.

1042
01:07:25,711 --> 01:07:28,320
All right. So is this a, is
that etiquette? I'm never,

1043
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:33,420
it's been a mess is a new rule for me.
He's got to give it away. So many Gotcha.

1044
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:37,470
Comes like I've let so many guys come
when they haven't done anything for me

1045
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:42,810
then I'm tired of it. Yeah. I'm 34
and I just, I don't believe, I don't,

1046
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:45,690
just because I'm hooking up with a guy,
it doesn't mean he gets to come anymore.

1047
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,240
And that used to be my role.
Like, you know, if you get two,

1048
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:52,350
you get to a guy to a point where
he is thinking he's going to orgasm.

1049
01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:56,610
You a lot of girls feel obligated to
bring about that orgasm because there's

1050
01:07:56,611 --> 01:07:59,790
this blue balls thing and you
just feel like you're a bad woman.

1051
01:07:59,791 --> 01:08:01,590
He's going to be frustrated.
He's not to be able to get to sleep.

1052
01:08:01,591 --> 01:08:03,750
All these things,
like if he doesn't get to come,

1053
01:08:03,751 --> 01:08:07,270
and a lot of times you guys don't deserve
to come. You didn't do anything. Wow.

1054
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:10,710
Two, um, and I love when you
come, I want you to come,

1055
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:15,590
but if you're not even trying to make
me come at all, no desi very sided.

1056
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:19,490
You don't get it. And guess what? Once you
calm, I know it's over. People are like,

1057
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,070
well, just why don't you make him come
and then have them go down on you?

1058
01:08:22,071 --> 01:08:24,300
And I'm like, um, cause I don't
believe in animal cruelty.

1059
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:30,590
I wouldn't make it a guy. I used to
say this, but like after a guy comes,

1060
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:32,270
he wants to shut me like a laptop.

1061
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:36,890
Like he doesn't want to like keep
fingering me. It's over. I'd be like,

1062
01:08:36,891 --> 01:08:39,510
have you ever been with a guy before?
That's not how it happened.

1063
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:42,590
Girls say that though.
They don't know. But like,

1064
01:08:43,930 --> 01:08:48,800
but I feel that way too. Like after
the lady does Bangkok, I'm over it.

1065
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:51,700
I'm like, oh good, can we, let's now see,

1066
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:55,850
I am like still cause girls
can have like multiple,

1067
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:59,450
so I can still be turned on enough
to like maybe I can go again. Sure.

1068
01:08:59,451 --> 01:09:00,750
That's true.
You need to kind of,

1069
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:05,910
but I do relate to when you have
had one that's like the one time.

1070
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:10,660
Yes. So I see related to that. So, so
you guys do it and so what happened? No.

1071
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:14,240
So I'm, so we're looking up and
we're just making out and stuff,

1072
01:09:14,241 --> 01:09:18,740
but we're both really tired. Like really,
really like we've had long ass days.

1073
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:23,720
We both worked and um, and his heart,
he's okay. I'm like almost naked.

1074
01:09:23,721 --> 01:09:26,930
I think. I'm just like wearing a
thong. Like that's it. And he's in,

1075
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:29,890
he still has his shoes on and
like maybe a top hat. Like,

1076
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:33,260
I didn't let him take off anything
because I was just like, you're,

1077
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:35,840
I don't want you to think that you're
going to get anything out of this until

1078
01:09:35,841 --> 01:09:37,610
you at least do something for me.

1079
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:41,960
And this guy definitely hasn't like put
in the work before and he's hasn't taken

1080
01:09:41,961 --> 01:09:45,890
me out. He hasn't done anything, really
isn't even a corded you at all at all.

1081
01:09:45,891 --> 01:09:49,930
So I'm just like, you had to
fuck your wave him. Oh over
fuck this guy. I like him.

1082
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,800
So I just, and, and he's a nice
guy and he's so hot. God Damn it.

1083
01:09:54,801 --> 01:09:58,910
He's so hot. And so I was talking
and I'm like, why am I not turned on?

1084
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:02,390
But I'm not, I just know that I'm
not going to have an orgasm. Like I,

1085
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:06,710
the Wa the fingering style wasn't my
favorite, but that is not his fault.

1086
01:10:06,711 --> 01:10:09,080
He was doing a great job and he
was trying, but he was tired.

1087
01:10:09,081 --> 01:10:11,150
And also I've required like a lot of work,

1088
01:10:11,151 --> 01:10:14,570
like I'm a lot of work and that nothing's
been, sorry to interrupt, but yeah,

1089
01:10:14,571 --> 01:10:18,350
but nothing is worse than a bad
fingery. Yes, I can throw in.

1090
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:23,260
You're not even close. No, and but I don't
expect someone to get that right. Yeah,

1091
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:27,860
that that is beside. That's what
I like. See, we're all different.

1092
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:32,810
I need to be like violently fracked.
Are you kidding me?

1093
01:10:33,290 --> 01:10:34,250
Well,
a lot of guys,

1094
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:39,240
I mean eventually it leads to

1095
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:45,520
mouth.
What do you mean into the mouth?

1096
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:49,490
The Porno and then they choke
you with your own. Listen,

1097
01:10:49,491 --> 01:10:52,110
I'm not opposed to any of that stuff.
Eventually down the road,

1098
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:56,300
the first time hookup,
so,

1099
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,520
okay, so he's finger banging
you. It's not your style.

1100
01:11:02,521 --> 01:11:04,640
It's nothing against like I would,
I'm,

1101
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:08,000
I can't wait to hook up with this guy
again because he has so much promise.

1102
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:09,410
I just,
we were both tired.

1103
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:13,320
His heart wasn't in it and at one
when I looked down and heart, not it,

1104
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:18,390
it makes me crazy. It's knows I'm not
going to fuck him. He's pretty sure he's,

1105
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,840
he's pretty sure. I'm like, I'm
really making them work for it.

1106
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:25,110
Then he takes out his penis.
At one point I looked down and it's out,

1107
01:11:25,111 --> 01:11:28,870
which is reasonable. I was fully
like almost fully naked. Is sure.

1108
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:32,920
It wasn't like I was like, oh no,
but his dick is out and I go, um,

1109
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:37,980
thought it was oh yeah, it was, it was
great. It was good. Yeah. And I go,

1110
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:40,350
um,
you're going to need to put that away.

1111
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:44,370
Like it's not going to be addressed yet.
Like I'll let you know, but it's not now.

1112
01:11:44,371 --> 01:11:48,930
So I made him put it away.
I don't like,

1113
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:51,360
I don't like,
I actually like to be the one dominated,

1114
01:11:51,361 --> 01:11:55,470
so I did not like doing that. Yeah.
She's just like put that away.

1115
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:01,720
I know like the Puerto Rican guide that
I thought would be my one night stand,

1116
01:12:03,061 --> 01:12:06,900
it was a similar thing where I was like,
no, I don't think so. And to say no,

1117
01:12:06,901 --> 01:12:07,411
and you're right,

1118
01:12:07,411 --> 01:12:10,770
the pressure is very high on us to
continue with what you're doing.

1119
01:12:10,771 --> 01:12:15,510
And it's really, it's hard
to be like, Nah, that was
harder for me to do that anal,

1120
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:20,130
I got to put away his deck when I
was like, I'm just not, I don't want,

1121
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:23,460
I want it yet. I'll let you
know. That's very mature.

1122
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:27,720
This is what I want to know.
How did he handle that?

1123
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:33,470
That's true. He goes, oh,
he was, he was like really?

1124
01:12:33,490 --> 01:12:35,910
Like he was kind of like really
like he couldn't believe it.

1125
01:12:35,911 --> 01:12:36,780
That was going to be put away,

1126
01:12:36,781 --> 01:12:40,950
but he was understanding this guy was so
cool about all of this stuff. So cool.

1127
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:44,610
Great Guy. That's why I'm like, I really
do like this guy. And I even told him,

1128
01:12:44,611 --> 01:12:45,930
I was like,
listen,

1129
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:50,820
you have a great deck and I can't wait
for this thing to be in me someday and it

1130
01:12:50,821 --> 01:12:54,420
will be if you play your cards right, like
I'm, I'm looking very forward to that,

1131
01:12:54,690 --> 01:12:55,210
but it's,

1132
01:12:55,210 --> 01:12:58,590
it's just not tonight and I'm not even
convinced I'm going to like deal with it

1133
01:12:58,591 --> 01:13:01,260
tonight. Like I might not even
touch it because first of all,

1134
01:13:01,261 --> 01:13:04,140
I don't have that much confidence
in the end at this point.

1135
01:13:04,141 --> 01:13:06,690
Surely like four months ago or
whenever this one's five months ago.

1136
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:10,050
I've gotten way better at blow jobs since
then, but at this point I'm just like,

1137
01:13:10,051 --> 01:13:12,660
those aren't, I'm not really like
confident enough to be like, well,

1138
01:13:12,661 --> 01:13:16,560
let me just do this and not competent
enough to enjoy doing it. Well,

1139
01:13:16,561 --> 01:13:18,990
I mean that's kind of a
special treat for somebody.

1140
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:21,330
I always felt that that
believing that a guy,

1141
01:13:21,331 --> 01:13:24,090
a blow job is harder than
just being like just fucking,

1142
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:29,120
that's why I know Christine that is weight
struggle is because I always just go

1143
01:13:30,391 --> 01:13:32,940
to sex because it was so much easy.
It's the easiest thing,

1144
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:36,390
but for some reason it has the most
weight attached to all your mouth is so

1145
01:13:36,391 --> 01:13:39,500
intimate and really commit the Lakers,

1146
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:43,530
which were would you go mouth first?
What are you talking about?

1147
01:13:43,570 --> 01:13:48,270
What's which one? All of them
after a game. They're clean.

1148
01:13:48,271 --> 01:13:49,470
They're showered.
Babe.

1149
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:53,520
I would much rather just get banged out
a bunch because at least you're getting

1150
01:13:53,521 --> 01:13:56,610
something out of that. I don't have like
that's what I'm endings in my mouth.

1151
01:13:56,810 --> 01:13:58,180
It's actually very uncomfortable.

1152
01:13:58,410 --> 01:14:03,030
That's when I'm giving a
blowjob to someone I love
and care about. It's amazing.

1153
01:14:03,031 --> 01:14:07,560
It's so fun to do, but, or it
can be, it's not, but it can be

1154
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:11,980
put it away. So cool about it. And then

1155
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,210
do you end up,
you go back

1156
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:17,240
and then I think it takes, he takes,
he took it out again. I think you can.

1157
01:14:17,241 --> 01:14:21,620
I know which is again fine cause we were
really working up to some stuff and I

1158
01:14:21,621 --> 01:14:26,000
just, it was a mixture of me being like
you don't deserve it. And also, um,

1159
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,940
I don't really want to do anything to you.

1160
01:14:28,941 --> 01:14:32,450
Like I'm not in the mood to suck a penis
and I certainly am not in the mood to

1161
01:14:32,451 --> 01:14:37,010
Jerky was like I have no jerk off coffee.
I don't do that and neither do I.

1162
01:14:37,011 --> 01:14:40,430
So I'm not going to do things I'm not
good at and so I'm just not going to do

1163
01:14:40,431 --> 01:14:42,830
anything to you.
And so I kind of,

1164
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:46,340
at one point we were just like making
out and it was kind of just get winding

1165
01:14:46,341 --> 01:14:50,990
down, you know, and I, we
just kind of go and he goes,

1166
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:54,470
do you just want to go to our separate
hotel rooms and jerk off to this?

1167
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:57,620
And I was like, yes, he gets up,

1168
01:14:57,810 --> 01:15:01,910
doesn't have to put on anything cause he
has everything on. He kisses me, goodbye,

1169
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:07,360
leaves any walks and I hear him go into
his room and we both just standards.

1170
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:10,460
I don't know if he jerked off, I
just ate some chips and watched, uh,

1171
01:15:10,490 --> 01:15:12,860
in my feelings challenges the
Drake and my feeling like that was,

1172
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:16,190
I remember it was the night I saw
Kiki, do you love me? And I was like,

1173
01:15:16,191 --> 01:15:19,250
what is this dance craze? And I just
watched it in bed and I was like, oh yeah,

1174
01:15:19,251 --> 01:15:23,910
I just hooked up to, it was weird. So that
was the end of it. And um, since then we,

1175
01:15:23,911 --> 01:15:27,650
we sext and stuff and we see each other
out and about and there's like so much

1176
01:15:27,651 --> 01:15:29,060
fun.
NRG and it's still

1177
01:15:29,210 --> 01:15:32,510
still very much on still alive.
Oh yeah. Yeah. Well, guess what?

1178
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:37,540
There's a little competition for baguette
letting some of your mom's house might

1179
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:43,670
soon be in Nikki's pants.
If you play your cards right.

1180
01:15:43,671 --> 01:15:47,480
Here we go, whew, man. My fucking
with clown. Look, I'm from Florida.

1181
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:53,930
I'm looking for my queen. No, I'm saying
Sean Garby skin shown Barbie Fitch.

1182
01:15:53,931 --> 01:15:55,490
You can be anywhere between,
you know what I'm saying?

1183
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:58,680
I just need some man motherfucking Wiki.
Juggle that low.

1184
01:15:58,681 --> 01:15:59,514
You know what I'm saying?

1185
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:03,500
Well guys, this is, she doesn't
have to be fat or skinny,

1186
01:16:03,501 --> 01:16:05,500
but she has to be a juggle at.
Yeah.

1187
01:16:06,430 --> 01:16:10,070
Are you into ICP or kind of know?
I know you that well.

1188
01:16:10,130 --> 01:16:13,790
I don't feel like he really sees
me. Okay. You know what I mean?

1189
01:16:13,791 --> 01:16:16,760
What I know don't feel seen.
Fair enough.

1190
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:19,610
Do you see his lack of teeth?

1191
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,880
What do you think about
those fake shoppers?

1192
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:25,630
Okay. I've been on here.
I've been polite. A bank.

1193
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:33,610
Yeah. I like to house. Right on Natalie.

1194
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:35,440
Ups I would like

1195
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:41,650
to do is you read lefties.
I would like to have some sex.

1196
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:43,810
Okay.
Those are three different things,

1197
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:46,780
but also just some
probably appealed to you.

1198
01:16:47,730 --> 01:16:50,220
I like to have a woman in my home.

1199
01:16:51,950 --> 01:16:56,270
I can make her laugh. I must throw
out quite one. These young men are,

1200
01:16:56,271 --> 01:17:00,630
these little boys. They get
their set us off and then, oops,

1201
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:02,490
they don't care about their partner.

1202
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:04,653
He's talking about,

1203
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:06,663
okay.

1204
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:08,690
Oh last,

1205
01:17:10,150 --> 01:17:14,930
Ooh.
Ghoulish I asked lady,

1206
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:19,110
hey blue band, make sure
you, I even, I so yeah,

1207
01:17:19,330 --> 01:17:23,030
Mickey's face, he says, oh,

1208
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:28,110
cause it's in my memory forever.
It's almost a threat.

1209
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,920
Let me know what I just noticed too.

1210
01:17:32,530 --> 01:17:36,980
Ladies. I would like to pass.
I want to have sex. I got it.

1211
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:39,590
This is Asmar rabbi.

1212
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:44,620
Yeah, tell me about it. We
weren't, weren't fascinated.

1213
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:49,490
I love it so much that people are ASR
sensitive, right? Yeah. Like you, it's,

1214
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:52,240
yeah, it's tell people what it is. Okay.

1215
01:17:52,241 --> 01:17:57,241
So it's auto sensory Meridian
response I think is the ASM or,

1216
01:17:57,701 --> 01:18:02,050
but it's this feeling that you get
when you hear, um, there's certain,

1217
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:02,861
uh,

1218
01:18:02,861 --> 01:18:07,620
sound stimuli that make
you feel a tingling in the
back of your head that kind

1219
01:18:07,621 --> 01:18:10,090
of goes down your spine and
gives you this really soothing,

1220
01:18:10,091 --> 01:18:15,091
like numbed out wonderful feeling that
is described as brain a brain orgasm,

1221
01:18:15,881 --> 01:18:19,660
but it's not sexual. It just feels
super relaxing. Like, you know,

1222
01:18:19,661 --> 01:18:22,120
that thing you put on your
head that I love bangles.

1223
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:25,360
It's like that everywhere
and it's more intense.

1224
01:18:25,361 --> 01:18:28,150
And people that have it have been
getting it since they were kids. Like,

1225
01:18:28,390 --> 01:18:31,710
I didn't know. Head thing is
my, Oh my God, it's so amazing.

1226
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:35,320
Just get another one of those.
I know everyone should have one of those.

1227
01:18:35,321 --> 01:18:39,840
Why doesn't everyone have, we used
to, it's good writers. I hope that,

1228
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:44,460
oh, I don't like that. I
don't like that. No. Okay.

1229
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:47,550
I like soft spoken and I'm
like whisper. Oh, what about,

1230
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:55,120
oh yeah, I like this. I
watched people eat a lot.

1231
01:18:57,370 --> 01:19:02,200
Oh yeah. What does a cereal
salad. There's a salad. Yeah,

1232
01:19:02,201 --> 01:19:05,920
I think he's you like to this does that
for you. You feel the tingle, right?

1233
01:19:07,690 --> 01:19:12,040
Yeah. I love this. I know it's,
there's too many mouth sounds.

1234
01:19:12,041 --> 01:19:16,450
I don't like that. Oh it's two girls
just go into town. Is this a Muck Bang?

1235
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:21,280
That's what they call this when people
just eat a discuss like the sound though.

1236
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:25,480
I just, yes. Wow. Yeah.

1237
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:27,940
Actually I don't like the girl on the
left cause she's cheating with her mouth

1238
01:19:27,941 --> 01:19:31,150
closed. I kind of like an open
mouth and I know that disgusting.

1239
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:34,660
I didn't realize this until I was on a
plane once in a girl was eating a bag of

1240
01:19:34,661 --> 01:19:39,661
sun chips next to me and I was getting
numbed out so hard because this is a

1241
01:19:40,511 --> 01:19:42,940
feeling I've been getting since I
can trace it back to my first time.

1242
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:47,470
I felt it was in kindergarten and my
school teacher was reading a book to the

1243
01:19:47,471 --> 01:19:51,130
class and just the way she turned the
pages and was reading it and then she

1244
01:19:51,131 --> 01:19:55,820
would show it to all of us like this and
I would just be like, good, good, good,

1245
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:59,020
good. Don't stop. Don't
stop. Like it would be like,

1246
01:19:59,050 --> 01:20:03,610
or the kind of orgasmic type feeling,
but not, it wasn't like it was turned on.

1247
01:20:03,611 --> 01:20:08,280
You don't get wet listening to these
videos. You just feel so God damn,

1248
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:12,300
I thought I was gay for a while because
it's always women's voices that do it

1249
01:20:12,301 --> 01:20:16,840
for me. So throughout my childhood it
would just be like, you know, uh, uh,

1250
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:21,150
a woman like a mob who was volunteering
with our math class to like help us with

1251
01:20:21,151 --> 01:20:25,290
our homework and she would reach around
me and um, and, and show me like,

1252
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:30,090
you carry the seven and then you add the
three bracelets with like jingle on the

1253
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:33,510
desk. And I couldn't even
pay it. I would just be like,

1254
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:36,240
oh,
it was so good.

1255
01:20:36,241 --> 01:20:39,690
But now I've worn it out so much that
I don't even get the tingles anymore.

1256
01:20:39,691 --> 01:20:42,190
It just is soothing to me to
play these videos. This guy,

1257
01:20:42,191 --> 01:20:44,250
this guy's a SMR guy here.

1258
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:47,370
Hey guys,
I'm going to tell you something.

1259
01:20:49,830 --> 01:20:53,370
You are not bad.
Nothing is bad.

1260
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:57,290
It's a matter of the
physical life on them.

1261
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:00,340
I hate what he's saying, but I
like his voice. Do? Yeah. Yeah.

1262
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:05,630
Can we face
our penis?

1263
01:21:06,110 --> 01:21:09,290
Oh No. Let's see. 10 o'clock no,

1264
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:13,330
his teeth are so crooked, but so
white. Oh, I guess the other DNA.

1265
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:16,840
Wait for someone with
that crooked of teeth.

1266
01:21:16,841 --> 01:21:20,500
You wouldn't think I care about whitening.
Sure. Yeah. This could be natural white.

1267
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:24,750
I don't know. No sulfur. I don't know.

1268
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:27,100
What makes you to know it
makes teeth white, by the way,

1269
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:32,200
when I notice on the ALMAC ECOM guy is
that he often does videos without his

1270
01:21:32,591 --> 01:21:33,700
teeth.
However,

1271
01:21:33,701 --> 01:21:38,110
on this last video you'll notice that
he took the effort to put in his bottom

1272
01:21:38,111 --> 01:21:41,410
bottom teeth and not and
not the top, however. Oh,

1273
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:45,430
so he kind of half ass the
denture game. It's like, well,

1274
01:21:45,431 --> 01:21:49,780
if you're going to go half, yes.
Why not put the top ones into? Yeah.

1275
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:53,770
It was an interesting choice on his
part and makes for a really good why mh

1276
01:21:53,771 --> 01:21:55,330
video.
He checks all the boxes.

1277
01:21:56,660 --> 01:22:01,090
You see a bad lighting,
bad background,

1278
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:04,400
denture choices, bad
request. It's all there.

1279
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:12,400
If I have another one of
his, cause I know. Sure.

1280
01:22:12,490 --> 01:22:17,260
I got legitimately excited that you had
an actual people. No for me to consider.

1281
01:22:17,261 --> 01:22:21,340
Now there's, you really are, I mean,
we're all friends. The same people.

1282
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:24,430
Which comedian do you want a date?

1283
01:22:24,431 --> 01:22:29,200
Because we all know that I've been through
them all or all the ones I want right

1284
01:22:29,290 --> 01:22:34,140
at this point. Yeah, I know. I know.
Why are you going to, are you open?

1285
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:37,750
Are you open to, hey, you know we have
data comedians. Do you? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1286
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:40,980
I'm open to comedians. I think
I'll end up with someone. Um,

1287
01:22:41,230 --> 01:22:45,620
who's a comedian or like at
least is a narcissist. Oh look.

1288
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:48,970
Bare minimum. Yeah. Do you think
you are in our sister? Probably.

1289
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:53,320
I don't think so a little bit, but I'm
drawn to narcissists I've found. Oh,

1290
01:22:53,321 --> 01:22:57,550
you like the emotional unavailability.

1291
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:03,490
You like musicians? No,
never really. I mean, yeah,

1292
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:06,280
optically they are pleasing,

1293
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:09,370
but I've never really had a connection
with one where I'm like, okay,

1294
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:10,803
okay,

1295
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:19,390
because here we go, here we go. I have
another beat down for your child practice,

1296
01:23:19,790 --> 01:23:24,250
practice my own songs is my introduction
to my song coming out. You're,

1297
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:28,830
here we go. I'll sing it. She's
worth the machine's worth.

1298
01:23:28,831 --> 01:23:33,490
Then they got a gun and got again.
Yeah. Got to terminate her gun. Yeah.

1299
01:23:33,491 --> 01:23:36,570
Machines.
But the machines were thin tea,

1300
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:41,670
16 to 60 to 6100% to 16 machines with
thin or students with thin trying to wreck

1301
01:23:46,981 --> 01:23:51,780
my rep, trying to make my rough talk
to summit flow, trying to practice.

1302
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:53,250
Some are full,

1303
01:23:56,220 --> 01:24:01,180
no street. I don't care. But the haters,

1304
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:02,273
the haters.

1305
01:24:02,330 --> 01:24:07,040
Hey, that's a great attitude. I thought
he was saying machines worth it. Oh No.

1306
01:24:07,041 --> 01:24:11,620
Within yeah. Machines with
them. Machines within. Um,

1307
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:15,200
yeah, I'll consider it. Yeah. Um,

1308
01:24:15,620 --> 01:24:18,320
are you aware of this man?
Uh,

1309
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:21,230
who reached out to a lady,
I mean,

1310
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:26,210
picture yourself leaving the gym and
somebody calls your name after like,

1311
01:24:26,211 --> 01:24:27,940
Hey Nikki and you don't know them.
Yeah.

1312
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:31,400
And then this is the scenario of how this
actually happened. If you don't know.

1313
01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:36,560
So this young lady left the gym.
Somebody says her name,

1314
01:24:36,561 --> 01:24:39,980
Hey Nikki, like do I know you?
And the guy was like, I just,

1315
01:24:40,010 --> 01:24:43,500
I saw your name on the sign in sheet.
Oh. He's like, well, you're lovable.

1316
01:24:43,501 --> 01:24:46,340
You're beautiful. You know, I'd love
to take you out sometime. You're like,

1317
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:49,370
I'm just, and you do like the kind
put that like where you're like,

1318
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:54,770
I'm actually talking to my ex and
um, you know, we're just kind of,

1319
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:55,161
and he's like,

1320
01:24:55,161 --> 01:24:59,870
what can I get your number and you're
holding your phone so you're like, I,

1321
01:24:59,871 --> 01:25:04,370
you know what? I'll take your number this
way if I want to. And then you're like,

1322
01:25:04,371 --> 01:25:07,460
put your number in there and he puts
his number in there and then he dials.

1323
01:25:07,730 --> 01:25:11,960
So now he has your number and then he has,
since he has your number,

1324
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:14,960
you think that's that you're
like, all right, whatever.

1325
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:19,400
The next morning you wake up
and this is on your phone.

1326
01:25:20,410 --> 01:25:25,120
Good Morning Julia [inaudible] Gel.
Just wanted to say hi.

1327
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:26,980
Wish you a great day.

1328
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:32,440
Tell you that meeting you yesterday and
getting a look at you was part of one of

1329
01:25:32,441 --> 01:25:35,500
the greatest moments of my life.
You were so beautiful.

1330
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:40,570
You don't know how beautiful you are
to me. I mean just, you're gorgeous,

1331
01:25:40,571 --> 01:25:44,590
you're precious. But it's been sitting
in my mind when you said to me,

1332
01:25:44,591 --> 01:25:48,970
you want to go back with
your ex boyfriend, please
erase him from your memory.

1333
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:51,130
Don't ever go back in the past.
I know,

1334
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:55,540
cause I've been there and I understand
when you know you're trying to find

1335
01:25:55,541 --> 01:25:57,120
somebody and you go on dates,

1336
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:01,000
nothing compares to your Eurex,

1337
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:05,510
but there is that better
person out there and Julia,

1338
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:10,040
I promise you it is me. I will love you
like you've never been loved before.

1339
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:14,870
Day One, minute one, I'll make you
feel like a woman, a real woman,

1340
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,420
and believe me,
after you experienced me,

1341
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,520
you won't even know who
your ex boyfriend is.

1342
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:22,850
Open up your heart to me in your arms.

1343
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:27,800
Let's go full throttle.
I could see me fall in love with you.

1344
01:26:28,570 --> 01:26:32,600
It just so I don't know. I just looked
into your eyes and I just melt. Anyhow,

1345
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:35,840
I've had an off to work.
This is my cute little home.

1346
01:26:36,110 --> 01:26:37,640
Everything you see behind me,

1347
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:42,440
I built everything every square inch
from crown mold and the chair rail to

1348
01:26:42,441 --> 01:26:46,400
floors, to lighting, to
plumbing, doors, windows.

1349
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:50,480
So this is the type of guy. Again,
I'm a very handy guy and uh,

1350
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:55,550
I love to build you. Whatever you want.
You're a sweetheart. Hold on. Wait for it.

1351
01:26:55,650 --> 01:27:00,020
Wait for it. Video doesn't scare you,
but that's how I feel. Wait for it.

1352
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:02,740
I just want you to know that.
Okay. And I look forward.

1353
01:27:02,741 --> 01:27:06,890
I'm going out to dinner with
you so let's make it happen.

1354
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,530
Nah,
Ciao Baby.

1355
01:27:10,650 --> 01:27:14,190
Sorry. Just to kind of thing
you're talking about foreplay wise,

1356
01:27:14,370 --> 01:27:18,950
I mean he kind of was like making her
field desire. Yeah. Things that I was,

1357
01:27:19,370 --> 01:27:22,740
oh Nikki, do we have a love
connection here? I'm just,

1358
01:27:22,741 --> 01:27:26,550
I feel bad that I've missed if I've
misled anyone to think that that would be

1359
01:27:26,551 --> 01:27:30,030
appropriate because that was so gross.

1360
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:34,800
But also he goes upstairs.
Sorry if I scared you.

1361
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:40,050
Had some self awareness that I kind of
appreciated at the end of the Ma was kind

1362
01:27:40,051 --> 01:27:44,100
of silly and like a fun, I
liked it. I didn't hate it.

1363
01:27:44,130 --> 01:27:47,190
See them walk a few more times,
but he's kind of being funny.

1364
01:27:47,191 --> 01:27:48,990
Like he had his little sense of humor.
Like,

1365
01:27:48,991 --> 01:27:52,620
I don't know that he was trying to
be completely sincere. Wait a second,

1366
01:27:52,650 --> 01:27:56,790
where did you get this and what
is, why is this real? It's so real.

1367
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:00,750
And were friends with
Julia now. Yeah. And she,

1368
01:28:00,751 --> 01:28:03,450
so we found this will sign to us first.
We found the story out.

1369
01:28:03,451 --> 01:28:05,970
We are fans contacted Julia,

1370
01:28:06,210 --> 01:28:10,320
we talked to Julia and then she sent us a,
why am age exclusive?

1371
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:16,050
There's a second one that he said she did
not respond to the first you I want to

1372
01:28:16,051 --> 01:28:19,890
say good morning. You send her
that at all. Yeah, my flower,

1373
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:24,300
my precious.
I still to be my everything.

1374
01:28:25,690 --> 01:28:30,300
Have a great day. Love. Oh wait,

1375
01:28:30,301 --> 01:28:33,030
it's his signature. Yeah, it's, that's,

1376
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:36,190
that is so disgusting.
And you know,

1377
01:28:36,510 --> 01:28:40,620
discuss what is going on with this
guy. What, how does he have a house?

1378
01:28:40,830 --> 01:28:42,170
He builds them.
But I just,

1379
01:28:42,230 --> 01:28:47,220
this crazy person like have a job in
a house and like a gym membership.

1380
01:28:47,221 --> 01:28:48,850
I don't understand how these people live.

1381
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:52,290
I live in Longmont lesson
has had a lot of fun with it.

1382
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:54,083
Julia

1383
01:28:57,060 --> 01:28:58,620
that morning,

1384
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:06,030
let's know that this car here that
I'm driving. Yeah, I built it myself.

1385
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:09,550
I fixing the heating. The heating
didn't work when I got the call,

1386
01:29:09,551 --> 01:29:12,010
but it's like I'm really
handy so I was able to fix it.

1387
01:29:15,790 --> 01:29:19,830
You told me all about you and I just
wanted to let me know that I have full

1388
01:29:19,831 --> 01:29:21,750
approval on look,
get all the fans

1389
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,790
a pot.
Oh boy.

1390
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:35,040
Good Morning Julia.
Good morning.

1391
01:29:35,041 --> 01:29:37,920
Julia,
you so much.

1392
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:42,320
I've been thinking about you
every day or do anything.

1393
01:29:43,690 --> 01:29:45,240
I wanted to get you something.

1394
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:51,100
Only women can really fully appreciate
like the uncomfortable creepiness and

1395
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:56,060
attack mode of receiving that message.
Guys do it. It's very funny too,

1396
01:29:56,330 --> 01:29:58,100
but I feel like the women doing it,
it's kind of

1397
01:29:58,130 --> 01:30:01,600
the women capture the feeling.

1398
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:07,420
I contact.
I catch with dog named.

1399
01:30:07,421 --> 01:30:08,900
Uh,
that's right.

1400
01:30:08,901 --> 01:30:13,690
I named after you so anytime you're not
here I can just come out and say good

1401
01:30:13,691 --> 01:30:14,700
morning Julie.

1402
01:30:19,590 --> 01:30:24,430
That's pretty great. Oh Man, we've all
been Julia before where? Just Nice.

1403
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:28,640
She'd give him your phone.
Then how can you go?

1404
01:30:28,641 --> 01:30:31,430
How did this guy get my number?

1405
01:30:31,431 --> 01:30:34,480
How did it get to this Rick?
To me

1406
01:30:34,580 --> 01:30:37,700
when we first saw these,
his video, I was like,

1407
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:43,080
I actually felt bad for the guy a
little bit. Have we traced, well we've,

1408
01:30:43,330 --> 01:30:44,300
we've got some,

1409
01:30:44,990 --> 01:30:49,710
I'm kind of don't want to,
let's not. Yeah, yeah. Don't,

1410
01:30:49,711 --> 01:30:52,680
don't learn. No, this guy's scary.

1411
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:56,330
But the thing was that
like I started to go like,

1412
01:30:56,331 --> 01:31:01,331
well I feel like what he
did was he didn't control,

1413
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:05,480
there's an impulse in
you to not send that.

1414
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:09,180
But like you meet somebody, right? And
you go like, oh my God, I want that.

1415
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:13,460
That's my everything. It's like a
a rush, but everything in you goes,

1416
01:31:13,850 --> 01:31:17,900
well don't you don't make a video
to scent. Like sometimes you send,

1417
01:31:17,901 --> 01:31:20,840
maybe you sent a text to somebody,
like I feel like an idiot. Right?

1418
01:31:20,841 --> 01:31:23,300
You send it text,
but to make a video like,

1419
01:31:23,301 --> 01:31:28,160
so I felt bad for him that
he put that out there.

1420
01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:30,580
But at the same time there's
something real wrong.

1421
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:31,473
There's something wrong.

1422
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:37,870
There's a sadness about his situation.
Yes. Oh, I don't even know that.

1423
01:31:37,871 --> 01:31:40,360
I want to make fun of this.
Cause this guy maybe a special,

1424
01:31:40,361 --> 01:31:43,660
but then he built that whole house.
He can't be that like he's not special.

1425
01:31:43,661 --> 01:31:48,130
You're not touched.
It feels a little touch.

1426
01:31:48,131 --> 01:31:50,830
That lack of awareness.

1427
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:53,110
[inaudible]

1428
01:31:55,730 --> 01:32:00,220
and Julia, I just wanted to tell you
that getting it's been my anniversary

1429
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:03,580
with you the other day. It was one
of the greatest moments in my life.

1430
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:04,583
Life.

1431
01:32:05,830 --> 01:32:10,330
Anyway, all uh, I'll hop off
here but have a good day baby.

1432
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:15,280
Oh, they always the fans.
Julia. So many fans. Juliet.

1433
01:32:15,910 --> 01:32:19,220
I'm so excited.
I can hardly contain it.

1434
01:32:20,690 --> 01:32:24,530
I don't know if you recognize
this, but I'm in the class. It,

1435
01:32:27,210 --> 01:32:31,080
I bet friend
restraints.

1436
01:32:31,930 --> 01:32:32,763
Ah,

1437
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:37,730
I heard you coming in through the front
door now to change the locks back on

1438
01:32:37,731 --> 01:32:38,564
your door.

1439
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:43,730
That's a lot of stuff I could be fixing

1440
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:48,510
was great. One. Can't wait.

1441
01:32:48,710 --> 01:32:52,830
We'll all end up going to cough.
So fucking full truck

1442
01:32:54,910 --> 01:32:57,110
anyways,
I'll see you in a second.

1443
01:32:58,860 --> 01:33:01,620
Yeah, there's so many of them.
They did so many funny ones.

1444
01:33:01,650 --> 01:33:03,810
And then today we already did it twice.

1445
01:33:03,811 --> 01:33:06,760
But should we play it for Nikki because
it's so good. It's so good. Dude.

1446
01:33:06,810 --> 01:33:11,630
We have this guy who does prank
calls. Yeah. For us with the show.

1447
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:15,840
Oh my God, this is, I think his
masterpiece. Like I've never,

1448
01:33:16,510 --> 01:33:20,790
it's the best thing I've ever heard.
Um,

1449
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:25,110
he right. It's like, it's,
it's unbelievable. It's genius.

1450
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:28,200
So this guy called,
um,

1451
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:33,570
he called a hardware store
and he sets up a call.

1452
01:33:33,571 --> 01:33:35,730
He sets up the drops he's going to play.

1453
01:33:36,270 --> 01:33:39,690
So he calls the hardware store
that's taking applications and he,

1454
01:33:41,210 --> 01:33:44,090
hello, this is Kevin, the
store manager. May I help you?

1455
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:48,670
Hey Kevin. My name is Bert
called in regards from my father,

1456
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:51,160
her the harder and so,
uh,

1457
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:54,730
my dad's been a handyman 35 years now.

1458
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,080
Oh, okay. What's Your Dad's name?

1459
01:33:58,270 --> 01:33:59,620
Heroin will puts you on the phone.

1460
01:33:59,621 --> 01:34:03,220
Maybe you can just tell them a little
bit more about the job. His name's Joe.

1461
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:08,440
Oh, okay. Awesome. Okay.
The morning. Me, Joe.

1462
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:12,740
Hello Joe. I'm a very handy
guy. Just wanting to say,

1463
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:17,050
I built everything every square inch
from crown mold into chair rail.

1464
01:34:17,820 --> 01:34:21,820
Perfect. Yeah. The floors to
lighting, to plumbing doors,

1465
01:34:21,821 --> 01:34:23,090
windows installed.

1466
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:26,830
This is the type of guy you got
to build you whatever you want.

1467
01:34:26,890 --> 01:34:30,550
I just want you to know that,
hey, let's make it happen.

1468
01:34:30,970 --> 01:34:32,520
Um,
so

1469
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:38,550
you're hard to make in your arms.
How beautiful you are to me.

1470
01:34:40,350 --> 01:34:43,470
Yes. I mean just, you're
gorgeous. You're precious.

1471
01:34:43,530 --> 01:34:48,530
I will cherish shoes turned into that
love you like you never been loved before.

1472
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:54,640
Uh, uh, come in and read heart. Okay.

1473
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:58,080
Okay. I look forward going
out to dinner with you.

1474
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:04,060
Come in and see he and easy handling
all the incoming and outgoing.

1475
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:09,870
I could see me falling in love with you
anyhow. I'll make you feel like a woman.

1476
01:35:09,950 --> 01:35:13,930
A real one. Okay. Ciao baby.

1477
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:21,620
I'll make you feel like a real woman.
Okay, Joe. Okay. Joe. Jesus Christ.

1478
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:26,710
It's so juveniles. That one
fucking amazing saw. Amazing.

1479
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:31,340
Oh No. Nikki, have you ever
done the converse of this?

1480
01:35:31,341 --> 01:35:36,230
Like have you ever sent something that
you wish you had it to a boy where you

1481
01:35:36,231 --> 01:35:41,200
wish like, oh my God, time. Uh,
but the text messages? No, I mean,

1482
01:35:41,201 --> 01:35:45,140
yeah. Um, I've seen
like pictures and stuff,

1483
01:35:45,141 --> 01:35:49,880
but I really am pretty good about like,
if, if I send you a naked picture,

1484
01:35:49,881 --> 01:35:53,890
like you, I trust you a lot.
Like it takes me a lot to that.

1485
01:35:54,420 --> 01:35:58,730
Oh No. And I want to, man, it's
like sometimes I'm like, God,

1486
01:35:58,750 --> 01:35:59,750
I can't do anything with,

1487
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:01,520
like sometimes you get out of
the shower and you're like,

1488
01:36:01,550 --> 01:36:04,990
I work on myself and I'm like,
I'm, I'm peaking right now. Oh,

1489
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:07,580
I know what you're like, say
the opposite. I'm like, Ooh,

1490
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:12,010
I don't know why to look at a lighting.
I'd have to get on myself. God Damn it.

1491
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:14,660
Somebody would throw
up if I sent him this.

1492
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:19,040
I don't think anybody wants to look
at my mom's sloppers either. Well,

1493
01:36:19,041 --> 01:36:21,890
I've said I have many days like that,

1494
01:36:21,891 --> 01:36:24,410
but like there are some
days where you're like,

1495
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:29,150
I wish I could share this with someone,
but I just don't.

1496
01:36:29,470 --> 01:36:33,350
And I know a lot of girls that will just
send those things out to get validation

1497
01:36:33,351 --> 01:36:37,560
and praise all angels.
I know you don't know.

1498
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:41,480
And so many things like that. But,
um, I can't do it, but I've sent,

1499
01:36:41,481 --> 01:36:44,690
I'm just like,
I've had manic episode,

1500
01:36:44,691 --> 01:36:47,990
like where I'm just having a bad day and
I'm mad at a guy or something and then

1501
01:36:47,991 --> 01:36:51,410
I just am like, well, I don't
think you understand where
I'm coming. Like, you know,

1502
01:36:51,411 --> 01:36:55,400
you just have a text exchange. I'm home
for Thanksgiving and having a manic.

1503
01:36:55,850 --> 01:36:58,850
And then you look at a bunch of,
of chunk of blue and you're like,

1504
01:36:58,851 --> 01:37:00,310
I didn't need to send the same graph right

1505
01:37:00,910 --> 01:37:04,120
back a little while to this stuff. But
do you ever do it? Like I was always,

1506
01:37:04,121 --> 01:37:07,360
I was never, I didn't like, um,

1507
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:11,740
like if I went out on a date with
a girl and then like, uh, you know,

1508
01:37:11,741 --> 01:37:14,440
it was a good date. You're like,
I like her, you know, I like her,

1509
01:37:14,441 --> 01:37:17,370
but then she's like, oh, I can't stop
thinking about you. I go like, ah,

1510
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,520
no, that's, yeah, she's like gross. Yeah,

1511
01:37:22,530 --> 01:37:26,400
it's a lot. It's a lie. I would be like,
that's weird. And then I don't know,

1512
01:37:26,401 --> 01:37:29,580
suddenly I tell a friend,
some people react differently.

1513
01:37:29,581 --> 01:37:32,660
So like some friends would be like,
it's great, right? I'm like, no, no,

1514
01:37:32,670 --> 01:37:36,630
but she's talking about it. We went
on a date. Yeah, I play it. Cool.

1515
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:40,710
I always like, well don't you remember
being in like six or seventh grade?

1516
01:37:40,770 --> 01:37:45,030
Like just when the feelings start to
really get intense. That's the opposite.

1517
01:37:45,031 --> 01:37:48,850
That's what Joe did. Joe Did
a sixth grade, right? Yes.

1518
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:52,980
I want to love you forever
and I'll be your everything.

1519
01:37:53,510 --> 01:37:58,510
I felt the way Joe's felt recently
when I know that I shouldn't,

1520
01:37:59,011 --> 01:38:01,290
you know, you let your mind
wonder and it was like this is,

1521
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:05,280
I would be there for it. Like I don't
know, happens in you when you do not let,

1522
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:10,080
you don't even let out one percentage
of what he let out. You play it. Cool.

1523
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:14,490
And I remember being in seventh grade
and just being so obsessed with this boy

1524
01:38:14,491 --> 01:38:16,590
in my class. Like, you know
when you're just, Oh my God,

1525
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:20,130
but you don't really like I was in
seventh grade, so at that level,

1526
01:38:20,370 --> 01:38:22,670
I mean there was like one girl
that had been finger bang,

1527
01:38:23,010 --> 01:38:23,731
our went on to say her name,

1528
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:27,390
but she had really big cans
and so everybody assumed
that she was a slut and I

1529
01:38:27,391 --> 01:38:28,440
don't think she was,

1530
01:38:28,590 --> 01:38:31,980
her first name is Shelby and that they
said that she got fingered during top gun

1531
01:38:32,010 --> 01:38:34,140
at the movies.
I don't think it happened,

1532
01:38:34,290 --> 01:38:37,750
but the point is I was so into this
guy and you know, you're just like, oh,

1533
01:38:37,751 --> 01:38:41,880
I just burning with love. And I would
just like write letters and be like, Gosh,

1534
01:38:41,881 --> 01:38:45,570
I give a talk and I thank God I didn't.
But you know what I mean?

1535
01:38:45,571 --> 01:38:49,650
When you're like this close to doing
that thing and you're like, Oh God,

1536
01:38:49,710 --> 01:38:50,870
I just should,

1537
01:38:50,910 --> 01:38:55,910
I should convince yourself even as
like I'm not like in the past couple of

1538
01:38:56,070 --> 01:39:00,560
years, like you just go to a place where
you can convince yourself that, I mean I,

1539
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:05,630
I'm constantly having to play games
with guys with texting and exhausting

1540
01:39:05,790 --> 01:39:10,170
acting. Like you don't want to hear from
them when you do and not watching their

1541
01:39:10,171 --> 01:39:13,320
Instagram videos so that they know
that you don't really care about that.

1542
01:39:13,321 --> 01:39:17,170
Like it's there so people can
tell if you've watched. Yes, yes.

1543
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:22,710
Huge thing. Like your Instagram
story. Okay. So like if you look at,

1544
01:39:22,711 --> 01:39:24,750
you can look at your own Instagram story,
swipe up on it,

1545
01:39:24,751 --> 01:39:27,930
and then you see everyone
who has watched it.

1546
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:31,830
Now if you have a crush on a guy and a
guy likes you a way he can let you know

1547
01:39:31,831 --> 01:39:35,490
he likes you before you even talk is
that you just start seeing his name under

1548
01:39:35,491 --> 01:39:39,720
everything that you do and you're like,
he's paying attention to me, this guy.

1549
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:41,850
And then you go, okay, this guy in to me.

1550
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:45,240
And then maybe you start following him
or maybe like you the next time you see

1551
01:39:45,241 --> 01:39:48,390
him at the club or whatever you're like,
and you just,

1552
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:51,300
that is a way to let a girl know that
you're in tour is if you want a lot of

1553
01:39:51,301 --> 01:39:55,200
soul. And it's a way to let
someone know your nodded to them.

1554
01:39:55,201 --> 01:39:58,320
If you are continually
watching each other's videos
and then all of a sudden you

1555
01:39:58,321 --> 01:40:02,130
stop seeing his name, you go, oh my God,
he doesn't even care about me anymore.

1556
01:40:02,190 --> 01:40:06,120
When a lot of times they're purposely
not watching it so that they can send so

1557
01:40:06,121 --> 01:40:09,000
that they can play it cool.
Which I've done before where I'm like,

1558
01:40:09,001 --> 01:40:11,520
I'm not gonna Watch this stuff so that
he doesn't think that I'm thinking about

1559
01:40:11,521 --> 01:40:13,260
his career.
So it's,

1560
01:40:13,261 --> 01:40:17,430
so why aren't you stoked that we hooked
up on the time of like Friendster.

1561
01:40:17,730 --> 01:40:20,160
Friendster was around when
Tom and I got together.

1562
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:23,340
This is craziness and that's
when I just go, you know what?

1563
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:26,640
I'm going to stop playing these games
and just be honest and say how I feel.

1564
01:40:26,641 --> 01:40:29,220
And then that's not good either.
So you,

1565
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:33,120
it's either you play games or you're,
you scare them off with your honesty.

1566
01:40:33,121 --> 01:40:37,180
So it's just, it's, it's
too complicated. What Jean

1567
01:40:40,910 --> 01:40:43,410
has beautiful teeth,
perfect teeth, very white.

1568
01:40:43,411 --> 01:40:47,810
Do you get them professionally whitened?
No. You know what I use? Um, I turned on.

1569
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:53,360
All I do is I use arm and hammer baking
soda went through too is all you did.

1570
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:56,920
And I'm not kidding you guys.
Mama's secret. That's what you do.

1571
01:40:56,980 --> 01:41:00,340
What are you guys using? No, I'm saying
that's like old school, like doing it.

1572
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:04,540
Arm and Hammer. Baking soda whitening
toothpaste. I've turned everyone on to it.

1573
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:05,410
Anyone who does it,

1574
01:41:05,410 --> 01:41:08,050
just brush with that regularly in your
teeth will be white and you'll get

1575
01:41:08,051 --> 01:41:09,310
compliments about it.
That's all I do.

Got Invisalign happening lately.

1580
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:25,240
I snored a while. I have a
snore guard type. Guess what?

1581
01:41:25,690 --> 01:41:26,800
My wife snores now.

1582
01:41:27,030 --> 01:41:28,570

1583

1584
01:41:34,551 --> 01:41:38,270
Oh my God, Christina snore. You're such a
jerk. He just brought that up right now.

1585
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:41,900
You know what's crazy? I have a
library of them stored so that, oh,

1586
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:46,850
so don't feel safe. Don't
even feel safe. A library.

1587
01:41:46,860 --> 01:41:49,850
What did you just say? Well, there's
different snores in different days.

1588
01:41:49,851 --> 01:41:54,851
You know why she never
snored before she snored?

1589
01:41:55,280 --> 01:42:00,260
You're fucking evil during you are a
sociopath. You're going to murder me guys.

1590
01:42:00,261 --> 01:42:03,860
This is evidence for everybody listening.
Not going to murder. This is evidence.

1591
01:42:03,870 --> 01:42:07,970
Your psycho mother of my children, he
was something about anal sex. Negative.

1592
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,210
Wait a minute. You've been collecting
footage of me snoring since that.

1593
01:42:11,390 --> 01:42:14,170
Since we first blasted.
He just a few weeks of it.

1594
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:17,990
She's Oh no.
Oh No.

1595
01:42:18,230 --> 01:42:21,510
There might be a montage
coming. I don't know. No,

1596
01:42:24,050 --> 01:42:28,080
no. I don't know. Are you fucking
kidding me? I don't know what's happened.

1597
01:42:28,081 --> 01:42:28,940
Please promise me though.

1598
01:42:28,941 --> 01:42:32,690
People aren't looking at my tits out and
stuff cause I sleep, you know, come on.

1599
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:36,390
It's only the guys who want looking
at bay clipper, Lake Racers.

1600
01:42:38,330 --> 01:42:43,250
I had a dream that night that Tom and I
were doing it and that it was directly,

1601
01:42:43,251 --> 01:42:44,500
it was the night we went to a Lakers.

1602
01:42:44,501 --> 01:42:48,830
He saw a lake and as we started to go
to a Lakers game, next morning I go,

1603
01:42:48,831 --> 01:42:53,120
I was dreaming. We're making sweet marital
love and that he was all his color.

1604
01:42:53,450 --> 01:42:57,350
Yeah. Tom Colored. Yeah, but
his Dong was a big black dog.

1605
01:42:58,850 --> 01:43:00,270
How'd you feel about that?
I was like,

1606
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:02,690
cool and I'd love to go
to another Laker game.

1607
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:07,520
I Dunno why I'm really drawn
to these things now. Ever
like sports. She was like,

1608
01:43:07,521 --> 01:43:12,250
these Laker games are a blast. How's
that? Okay. I was like, how bad?

1609
01:43:12,251 --> 01:43:14,810
She was like, I mean they're fun. Can
we, when's it going to go to another one?

1610
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:21,170
All right. Okay. I told
my therapist about it.

1611
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:23,630
You get home immediately and
taking Melatonin. You're like,

1612
01:43:23,660 --> 01:43:27,890
I need to get to dreamland
right away.

1613
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:30,960
Right away.
And then like during the game,

1614
01:43:30,970 --> 01:43:34,850
just like how big do you think their
dicks are? Probably pretty big.

1615
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:39,450
I did not ask you that after the
game. You're like, Nah. You're like,

1616
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:42,980
how come they're dicks and balls aren't
like fluttering the show when we were

1617
01:43:42,981 --> 01:43:44,420
talking about after my dream,

1618
01:43:44,430 --> 01:43:46,700
it was a good way of compression
shorts on a good question.

1619
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:48,560
I could just be a dick and ball festival.

1620
01:43:48,630 --> 01:43:52,230
I don't know how you guys keep it all
but yeah, they have a bigger problem

1621
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:56,880
than I do that you are a straight
sociopath. What did I do?

1622
01:43:56,890 --> 01:43:59,420
You're keeping videos
of your wife's snoring.

1623
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,520
I cannot fucking believe
you're doing this.

1624
01:44:01,610 --> 01:44:04,270
You're actually going to have a whole lot.
I have 15 it's not like I have a,

1625
01:44:04,271 --> 01:44:05,660
well so uh,

1626
01:44:05,690 --> 01:44:10,690
Victoria Wiggins has a youtube channel
and she's helping people prep with anal

1627
01:44:11,481 --> 01:44:15,470
sex. We have our anal sex
expert, Nikki Glaser. Oh God.

1628
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:19,370
Blow us all away. Last time I
haven't had it since last time.

1629
01:44:19,371 --> 01:44:23,480
I don't think really want to tell me
what you think of Victoria's advice gave

1630
01:44:23,540 --> 01:44:27,530
advice and we want to know and I actually
kind of want somebody else in the room

1631
01:44:27,531 --> 01:44:29,930
to maybe pay attention to.

1632
01:44:31,420 --> 01:44:34,720
A lot of people have been asking me,
Victoria,

1633
01:44:34,721 --> 01:44:36,790
I'm so scared to have,

1634
01:44:36,970 --> 01:44:41,970
dare I say having sex in your
bus can be extremely terrifying.

1635
01:44:44,711 --> 01:44:47,000
There's a lot of things that
could go wrong, but when you,

1636
01:44:47,010 --> 01:44:50,410
there's a lot of things that could
go right. I've got a few tips.

1637
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:53,740
First is what you need. It's all about
your diet and start in the kitchen.

1638
01:44:53,741 --> 01:44:56,440
That's what they say, right? Well,
same thing goes for bottoming.

1639
01:44:56,441 --> 01:44:57,310
It starts in the kitchen.

1640
01:44:57,340 --> 01:45:01,480
There's a lot of things that you can't
eat like a few days before you bought

1641
01:45:01,481 --> 01:45:06,400
them.
So like pizza through vegetables,

1642
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:11,590
any food, any kind of protein, carb,

1643
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:16,150
fat. This is all food. What
should we eat? I'm not a few tips.

1644
01:45:16,180 --> 01:45:19,480
First is what you eat. It's all about
your diet. Abs Start in the kitchen.

1645
01:45:19,481 --> 01:45:23,130
That's what they say, right?
Step two, you got to relax.

1646
01:45:23,310 --> 01:45:27,550
When Tony going in there,
you're immediate reaction.

1647
01:45:27,610 --> 01:45:30,460
If you're new to the,
to the bus scene,

1648
01:45:31,090 --> 01:45:36,090
just clinch and you being your
body registers it as poop.

1649
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:41,580
So your immediate reaction is just clench
it out cause that's what you've done

1650
01:45:41,921 --> 01:45:43,210
your whole life.
Well,

1651
01:45:43,390 --> 01:45:45,430
I'm here to tell you that you're
going to have to unlearn that.

1652
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:50,860
I always start by letting me know
that I need him to start off slow.

1653
01:45:50,861 --> 01:45:52,360
I need him to go gradual.

1654
01:45:52,361 --> 01:45:56,740
I need him to go easy because you
don't want to start out too strong.

1655
01:45:56,800 --> 01:46:01,800
That's going to expedite your body's
immediate reaction to push out things.

1656
01:46:03,580 --> 01:46:08,410
I don't think we're intended to go up
there. However it feels really good.

1657
01:46:08,411 --> 01:46:12,130
So maybe there was a master
plan. I'm not sure. Jesus,

1658
01:46:12,131 --> 01:46:14,980
if you're out there loving the most,
you might clench so hard.

1659
01:46:14,981 --> 01:46:16,420
You might bleed through the sheets.
I mean,

1660
01:46:16,421 --> 01:46:20,170
it's happened to me before
and it's not a fun experience.

1661
01:46:20,230 --> 01:46:23,950
You could also be in a situation where
your body hates it so much that it will

1662
01:46:23,951 --> 01:46:26,500
shit on them.
Even though you've cleaned yourself out,

1663
01:46:26,501 --> 01:46:28,180
even though you didn't eat for three days,

1664
01:46:28,330 --> 01:46:31,180
it'll still shit on them because
it's like, it's like a kind of like,

1665
01:46:32,770 --> 01:46:36,190
it's like get away from me.
Not Eat for three days.

1666
01:46:36,620 --> 01:46:39,060
Is that what she's suggesting?
That is what she's doing.

1667
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:41,450
And I know girls that are like,
oh, I might have anal sex tonight.

1668
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:42,340
I'm not going to eat today,

1669
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:46,800
will not give you that. But I didn't
really, I'd say that's sound advice.

1670
01:46:46,830 --> 01:46:50,130
I would just like to maybe in the next

1671
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,530
time I have it,
I'm do I have like a whole plan?

1672
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:55,680
Because in the past it's been like
impromptu and I've been lucky.

1673
01:46:55,681 --> 01:46:56,730
I've also been unlucky,

1674
01:46:56,731 --> 01:47:00,120
but like in the future if I like
want it and I'm going to go do it,

1675
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:02,490
I'm going to get a, um, I'm going to,

1676
01:47:02,730 --> 01:47:05,840
cause I've done enemas like before
because you're supposed to just squirt,

1677
01:47:05,850 --> 01:47:07,200
went up there and clear it all out.

1678
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:09,000
But I don't know if I
talked about this last time,

1679
01:47:09,001 --> 01:47:11,610
but like you have to get like 10 enemas.
You can,

1680
01:47:11,611 --> 01:47:15,180
what do you tell them in 10 of us to be
totally thing you need to do it until

1681
01:47:15,181 --> 01:47:17,270
the water runs clear.
Oh.

1682
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:22,110
And I bought one once and that just
mixes things up and makes everything,

1683
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:26,130
oh, I see. What's bad, bad news.
And I, and I remember being like,

1684
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:27,460
I'm so sorry that happened.

1685
01:47:27,510 --> 01:47:31,020
Literally that happened because I
was trying to actually be better.

1686
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:35,730
Like you know that that was so much worse.
So there's ones I have,

1687
01:47:35,731 --> 01:47:39,000
I'm a hairstylist who is a gay
man and he was like, oh honey,

1688
01:47:39,001 --> 01:47:43,560
you need to get off Amazon like a reusable
one that you just keep filling with

1689
01:47:43,561 --> 01:47:48,100
saline solution instead of buying
like 16 bucks enemas at Walgreens.

1690
01:47:48,101 --> 01:47:51,170
It's smart. It's a lot of work, but it's,

1691
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:54,150
it feels really good and it's worth it.

1692
01:47:54,690 --> 01:47:59,690
I think it's when I am in the mood to
have some like really amped up like dirty,

1693
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:05,130
dirty sax and like really go all
out. Um, yeah, I put in that effort.

1694
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:09,880
Wow Man, this word, this pay
attention. What about now?

1695
01:48:09,881 --> 01:48:12,600
I just had my second
child five months ago.

1696
01:48:12,601 --> 01:48:14,910
So there's a lot of damage down there.
We're still,

1697
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:19,110
what do you do if a cow has hemorrhoids?
Cause I still, you're not doing that.

1698
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:23,550
I can't have bud sex. How did you
know that way? Did you hear that?

1699
01:48:23,551 --> 01:48:26,870
Hemorrhoids are so painful. I'm so sorry.
Oh, no, it doesn't hurt me as hard.

1700
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:28,740
It kind of doesn't. It's
weird. I don't know if it's,

1701
01:48:28,741 --> 01:48:32,160
cause I have a lot of fiber and my dad,
I don't push a lot when I make brown. Oh,

1702
01:48:32,161 --> 01:48:36,510
that's not really bothering me, but I
don't know if I'm going in at my, yeah.

1703
01:48:36,570 --> 01:48:40,770
Upset it. I just wouldn't want to. I think
the tissue is too sensitive for that,

1704
01:48:40,771 --> 01:48:45,480
but um, but yeah, it's like,
like she's saying about, um,

1705
01:48:46,410 --> 01:48:50,400
your body like pushes it like it,
it thinks it's poop.

1706
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:51,500
Like that's a real,

1707
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:56,520
I believe that because I've done a
suppository once and the how that works,

1708
01:48:56,791 --> 01:48:58,780
I believe there's glycerin too,

1709
01:49:01,830 --> 01:49:06,630
is that it's actually because you're
introducing something into your butt that

1710
01:49:06,631 --> 01:49:10,490
makes you feel like you have to shit.
Do you understand? Like, you know,

1711
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:15,180
you can get a baby to take a dump is if
you stimulate his be whole with the qtip

1712
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:18,750
that actually just stimulating
Massell think that it's already,

1713
01:49:18,751 --> 01:49:23,070
there's something right at the precipice
because a lot of times that's when it's

1714
01:49:23,071 --> 01:49:27,540
like, get out, get up. Right.
Sure. That was her next suggestion.

1715
01:49:27,570 --> 01:49:29,160
Next we're going to talk about animals.

1716
01:49:29,490 --> 01:49:34,490
I think animals are the best way
to prep yourself in a life packs.

1717
01:49:36,540 --> 01:49:40,500
You can buy enemas at the
drug store, Walmart, target,

1718
01:49:40,530 --> 01:49:45,530
wherever they have like a medicine I'll
obviously you want to get on the floor

1719
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:48,040
on all fours

1720
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:51,070
and then poke your ass up in the air.
Kind of like you're about to have sex.

1721
01:49:51,071 --> 01:49:52,660
It's kind of like a practice round.

1722
01:49:52,690 --> 01:49:57,690
You get your head down ass up just like
taiga likes it and you stick that in.

1723
01:49:58,090 --> 01:50:00,400
You squirt in all the liquid.

1724
01:50:00,401 --> 01:50:04,810
You don't want to do it too fast because
it can really disrupt the lining of

1725
01:50:04,811 --> 01:50:09,610
your bus. And then when I actually
like to do kind of bounce around,

1726
01:50:10,390 --> 01:50:11,890
maybe like, oh, okay,

1727
01:50:11,980 --> 01:50:14,860
I've never seen this actually helpful
just to kind of mix everything.

1728
01:50:17,460 --> 01:50:20,830
When your stomach starts hurting, when
you help all that fluid inside of you,

1729
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:25,270
that's a good thing because that means
that you're ready for the grand finale.

1730
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:28,870
The release, you need to sit on
the toilet for like 10 minutes.

1731
01:50:28,930 --> 01:50:30,700
You don't want to like squirt it out,

1732
01:50:30,701 --> 01:50:34,030
do your little Squirtle move
and then go hop on Daddy's Dick.

1733
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:37,300
That's not how it works.
You want to go sit pro tip.

1734
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:41,770
If you do feel like you need to do
around to please just use another enema.

1735
01:50:41,950 --> 01:50:45,400
Do not refill the bottle of water.

1736
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:47,080
I don't know what's in that shit,

1737
01:50:47,170 --> 01:50:52,170
but something in that solution
that's a not bottle really works.

1738
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:56,460
Water water will make your asshole rar.
Then at the end of it,

1739
01:50:56,470 --> 01:51:00,090
I mean it's just not good.
Oh Man.

1740
01:51:00,650 --> 01:51:05,650
My pet peeve is when people say their
stomach hurts and then you shit.

1741
01:51:07,310 --> 01:51:10,010
It's not your stomach that's hurting.
It's your intestines.

1742
01:51:10,011 --> 01:51:13,490
Your stomach is an Oregon above your
and test it. It's been my pet peeve.

1743
01:51:13,491 --> 01:51:17,850
My entire for my tummy hurts. It's not
your tummy stupid cause your intestines,

1744
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:19,933
your stomach,

1745
01:51:20,660 --> 01:51:23,870
the stomach's different pain and it's
the same thing like when women are

1746
01:51:23,871 --> 01:51:27,500
pregnant it's like it's none of my
stomach. Tommy. Does your tummy,

1747
01:51:27,501 --> 01:51:29,930
the babies in your tummy? No, not.

1748
01:51:29,931 --> 01:51:32,620
Do you know how bodies
were right to your uterus,

1749
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:37,160
your cut button?
My upper,

1750
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:41,720
my fucking cut.
She keeps saying her bus,

1751
01:51:42,660 --> 01:51:44,790
nine times out of 10,
if he's going to fuck your house,

1752
01:51:44,791 --> 01:51:46,870
he's going to eat your ass better.
Taste good.

1753
01:51:47,490 --> 01:51:51,150
You don't want to be tasting like
true mixture of shit and animals.

1754
01:51:53,160 --> 01:51:56,250
Baby. Why so much even? I'm like,

1755
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:58,520
I can't so much never happened.

1756
01:51:58,530 --> 01:52:03,060
You want to act like you weren't just in
the bathroom after doing those animus.

1757
01:52:03,130 --> 01:52:07,770
Yeah. You're gonna feel like you need
to shit more. Sure. Times out of 10,

1758
01:52:07,830 --> 01:52:11,850
it's false. It's a trick.
If you do two animals,

1759
01:52:12,420 --> 01:52:15,930
you're not going to shit. And I don't
know why we're not all doing it.

1760
01:52:17,310 --> 01:52:21,630
There's a lot of websites that
say, oh, you enemas are good,

1761
01:52:21,631 --> 01:52:24,410
but they're not necessary.
Sometimes all you need is a,

1762
01:52:24,411 --> 01:52:27,510
a soapy finger and a
washcloth. Well, I'm sorry,

1763
01:52:27,511 --> 01:52:30,990
are we living in the fucking 16 hundreds?
Do we not have enemas?

1764
01:52:31,230 --> 01:52:32,700
That's what they're made for.

1765
01:52:33,310 --> 01:52:35,920
Oh my God, you guys are so
disgusting. Um, all right,

1766
01:52:35,950 --> 01:52:39,930
well thanks for the advice Victoria. If
you want to donate, but Victoria, uh,

1767
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:42,530
like to donate, uh,
raising money for surgery,

1768
01:52:42,690 --> 01:52:45,620
go from me.com/victoria

1769
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:50,840
f f s is what I think I see
here. Yeah. So there you go.

1770
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:54,740
Yeah. Um, well it's a lot of
advice. I learned some stuff,

1771
01:52:56,530 --> 01:53:01,530
some stuff you should it to two of us and
if you have to shit after that is 900,

1772
01:53:01,821 --> 01:53:03,040
seven times. It's an illusion. It looks,

1773
01:53:03,060 --> 01:53:05,890
sounds like she's saying you might want
to get that box from rite aid of all

1774
01:53:05,910 --> 01:53:09,230
those. I think I'll get three
next time I'm ready to go.

1775
01:53:09,380 --> 01:53:12,110
But then I got to buy them separately
because I don't want it to look like I'm

1776
01:53:12,111 --> 01:53:16,880
about to have anal sex. You let me
ask you this, Jeff, do Yada Yada.

1777
01:53:16,890 --> 01:53:18,050
I have a question for you.

1778
01:53:18,410 --> 01:53:23,410
It just seems like studies so much work
to prepare for anal and doesn't it?

1779
01:53:24,290 --> 01:53:26,960
I just imagine after giving
myself three or four enemas,

1780
01:53:27,170 --> 01:53:30,680
I've killed the mood cause I
been shitting all day. Yeah.

1781
01:53:30,681 --> 01:53:33,110
You know when you have diarrhea
and then later you're like,

1782
01:53:33,111 --> 01:53:36,440
I can't have sex tonight. I
just shit a lot today. You know,

1783
01:53:36,441 --> 01:53:39,740
sometimes Tom will have diarrhea and
I'll be like, are we still doing it?

1784
01:53:39,741 --> 01:53:42,410
And you're like, no, I just had diarrhea.

1785
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:45,290
Diarrhea is no plant leg
while you're shitting all day.

1786
01:53:45,291 --> 01:53:50,291
You just said isn't it make your be whole
soar to give so many animals and then

1787
01:53:51,470 --> 01:53:55,730
you know. But I think in giving yourself
animas it would feel kind of good.

1788
01:53:55,820 --> 01:53:59,180
Like if you're in the
anal sex like as a girl,

1789
01:53:59,570 --> 01:54:03,410
I think I would start to, it would be
like a little bit of foreplay. Oh I see.

1790
01:54:03,411 --> 01:54:08,411
You like to be like I can't wait to
yeah because the thing about anal sex,

1791
01:54:09,021 --> 01:54:13,040
it feels good cause it feels like you're
taking a really good shit. Ah, right,

1792
01:54:13,041 --> 01:54:14,930
right, right. I liked right.
I don't like diarrhea.

1793
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:18,680
No one likes diarrhea but like right,
we all can get behind a really good shit.

1794
01:54:18,740 --> 01:54:22,280
Yeah I do. It's amazing. Like
a good shit feels so good.

1795
01:54:22,790 --> 01:54:25,910
And that's what anal sex feels
like. Like a good, like a really,

1796
01:54:25,911 --> 01:54:29,930
really satisfying one where it's like
you've had to go and then you're like,

1797
01:54:29,931 --> 01:54:33,670
your whole body is just like, ah, you

1799
01:54:37,340 --> 01:54:40,700
You make me want to take a shit. I
know, right? I never thought I'd say it,

1800
01:54:40,730 --> 01:54:42,860
but they know I have another
potential suitor for you

1801
01:54:47,490 --> 01:54:48,480
before you have sex.

1802
01:54:49,870 --> 01:54:53,580
If you want to be horny for two or three
hours like you never been in your life

1803
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:57,420
and you have access to marijuana too good.

1804
01:54:57,421 --> 01:55:00,900
We'd listen to me. Okay. Okay.

1805
01:55:02,750 --> 01:55:06,360
I'm listening as her weight alone can
get you really hornier than normal,

1806
01:55:06,361 --> 01:55:10,770
but it's been under all take about 10
12 Bannon girl before you want to have

1807
01:55:10,771 --> 01:55:14,650
your sexual fun with your partner or
whatever you do or masturbate. All right.

1808
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:18,330
Oh,
about an hour later when you fill it,

1809
01:55:18,331 --> 01:55:23,331
just kicking and smoke your weed done
and then go ahead and get horny and I

1810
01:55:24,241 --> 01:55:28,270
promise you it will be
millions of times more.

1811
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:31,950
You'll be so blissfully horny
that you will not want to come.

1812
01:55:33,030 --> 01:55:34,310
Trust me.
It

1813
01:55:34,330 --> 01:55:37,110
sounds like maybe you could
pass it on to potential mates.

1814
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:40,410
Can someone please try that and
see if it works? I think they have.

1815
01:55:41,550 --> 01:55:44,010
I mean my man right here.
It's the best idea.

1816
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:48,300
I want someone listening to Nellie's
try that. No, no, don't advocate.

1817
01:55:48,450 --> 01:55:50,260
You don't find it.
Don't not do it.

1818
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:54,750
Do not get anybody listening to this
show did not do what this man is doing.

1819
01:55:55,620 --> 01:56:00,270
What does that work? What if that's the
cocktail to be as Horny, happiness, joy?

1820
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:03,840
Well, you know what? I never realized
Tommy is the timeline. He's like,

1821
01:56:03,841 --> 01:56:07,770
you have to take 10 to 12 Benadryl
at once. You wait an hour.

1822
01:56:08,130 --> 01:56:09,000
It's so many.

1823
01:56:09,001 --> 01:56:13,500
You have to wait a full hour hour to
fight off that Benadryl and your system.

1824
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:18,570
Stay awake for an hour and then
smoke a ton of weed. Then get horny.

1825
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:21,520
Then he goes.
Then it's not like he will get you.

1826
01:56:21,521 --> 01:56:22,960
You're going to get horny does then.

1827
01:56:23,010 --> 01:56:28,010
Then you got to get in whenever so
much my formula for when you're Horny,

1828
01:56:30,410 --> 01:56:35,300
it's so labor. All of this is so
much work. Too much work. God. Oh,

1829
01:56:35,690 --> 01:56:38,940
where was he and what
was he sucking on again?

1830
01:56:38,941 --> 01:56:42,300
All the makings of a perfect video.
Where was he?

1831
01:56:42,301 --> 01:56:46,850
How horrible is the lighting? What's
the ask? All these things vary.

1832
01:56:47,270 --> 01:56:50,280
Whether the angle on
the camera was so good.

1833
01:56:50,330 --> 01:56:55,330
Seeing the closet with the glow you
the garage for other potential suitors.

1834

1855
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:29,620

1856
01:58:29,621 --> 01:58:30,560

But,

1857
01:58:33,460 --> 01:58:37,100
and his friends would go eight. You're,
you're with a really tall lady right now.

1858
01:58:37,101 --> 01:58:40,280
You shouldn't settle for
this. They usually would
say, what are you doing with,

01:58:45,240 --> 01:58:47,910
It's a preferred we sent,
might go the pain clinic, but

1862
01:58:49,910 --> 01:58:54,700
it keeps me from to go to let that go.
I ain't quick.

1863
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:55,593
Blah.

1864
01:58:55,640 --> 01:58:59,610
Yeah, you don't have to go to the pain
clinic. What is the pain clinic? Uh,

1865
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:03,620
you got a manager. He's got
a lot. Is the weed store,

1866
01:59:03,621 --> 01:59:07,490
isn't that medical
marijuana shot? God is, is.

1867
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:12,060
Maybe it's not. Is he
on a lot of style? Feet.

1868
01:59:12,570 --> 01:59:16,190
Go and get the methadone. Yeah, Methadone.

1869
01:59:16,191 --> 01:59:20,090
I know that would a pain clinic. Yes,
because you're out there by the way.

1870
01:59:20,650 --> 01:59:22,610
Dating question.
Yeah.

1871
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:27,380
It's funny that you bring that up
because there's another side effect to a

1872
01:59:27,381 --> 01:59:29,670
certain medicines.
Did it help

1873
01:59:31,050 --> 01:59:35,940
if you've had any kind of direct POW this
order problems? I'm here to tell you,

1874
01:59:36,510 --> 01:59:38,660
forget that bag or forget about salads.

1875
01:59:38,661 --> 01:59:41,220
Forget about Dick and
plants and all that stuff.

1876
01:59:42,180 --> 01:59:46,380
I don't know if you believe me or not
that he like to see me smokes meth with a

1877
01:59:46,381 --> 01:59:50,580
small limp. Dick. Get hard to hear the
way and why is he a harder and harder?

1878
01:59:50,650 --> 01:59:54,090
Norris smoke harder. My
big get this. Unbelievable.

1879
01:59:56,410 --> 02:00:00,710
You're gay. You won't believe how
good it is. Not your straight.

1880
02:00:00,770 --> 02:00:02,270
You won't believe how good it bills.

1881
02:00:02,660 --> 02:00:05,810
Your Dick had become so sensitive
that you don't need lube.

1882
02:00:05,811 --> 02:00:10,310
You don't need spirit. He just kept that
Dick head this up and down four times.

1883
02:00:10,311 --> 02:00:15,270
It's this hot bed and do it and you will
shoot an enormous amount of very good

1884
02:00:15,950 --> 02:00:17,930
do these Dick White Cup.

1885
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,140
Well,
you know who didn't believe him

1886
02:00:19,810 --> 02:00:22,730
and I'd rather they didn't believe me,
but when he smoked with me,

1887
02:00:22,731 --> 02:00:25,250
he put his dick.
I can't believe how big his dick was.

1888
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:30,500
He jacked off for Joe and shots and those
companies every time there's like 49

1889
02:00:31,550 --> 02:00:36,140
and he's fine. He has no neuropathy
problems at home. It gets even harder,

1890
02:00:36,570 --> 02:00:38,960
thicker and more come even believes me now

1891
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:43,850
he believes in me now. I just
caught that. He believes me now.

1892
02:00:43,851 --> 02:00:48,851
I believe me now hanging out with his
brother Jack Jack in math and his brother

1893
02:00:50,021 --> 02:00:51,280
takes his dick out.
Yeah.

1894
02:00:51,910 --> 02:00:56,750
The way he said Lou was the most
disgusting word. Don't need.

1895
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:00,633
Oh,

1896
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:05,620
how does this person have the
faculties to like upload this video

1897
02:01:08,310 --> 02:01:10,690
and like, oh, those are the
things that perplex me. It's like,

1898
02:01:10,691 --> 02:01:14,920
how did this guy get all that
done before she drove? Well,

1899
02:01:14,921 --> 02:01:18,310
and he's took time out from his lunch
at Applebee's to go in the bathroom

1900
02:01:18,940 --> 02:01:22,270
because you can also hear the
wait staff in the background.

1901
02:01:22,300 --> 02:01:27,300
You can hear order up like all that
clinking and clanking led to the Nachos.

1902
02:01:27,790 --> 02:01:29,340
Yup.
Pretty Great.

1903
02:01:29,990 --> 02:01:32,800
You know what weekend this weekend he's
going to take another bus. Oh my God.

1904
02:01:32,801 --> 02:01:32,900
We'll

1905
02:01:32,900 --> 02:01:36,610
get hard. So do you want to see me go
from a limp dick too hard day. I got it.

1906
02:01:36,640 --> 02:01:39,470
Thanks. Do it this weekend. He's
going to do what? You do. Tape it.

1907
02:01:40,180 --> 02:01:44,990
It's a small deck. Very lamp. Okay.
Watch it get harder and harder.

1908
02:01:45,140 --> 02:01:49,280
That's a proven fact, right? Let me know.
That bothered me a bit. If you say yes,

1909
02:01:49,310 --> 02:01:50,160
I'll show it to you.

1910
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:52,130
Uh, how hard it gets. Wait,

1911
02:01:52,220 --> 02:01:56,180
explain it again and see if I'm live and
I want you to see we get hard while she

1912
02:01:56,181 --> 02:01:59,330
smoked this meth with my brother,
his brother up to his brothers,

1913
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:01,780
his brothers packing a better.
I know it.

1914
02:02:01,850 --> 02:02:04,840
He couldn't believe how big his
brother's definitely in the low note.

1915
02:02:05,090 --> 02:02:07,190
What's interesting in that no
one's brought this up. A button,

1916
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:10,580
Nikki and all these people that have
observed these videos, she's right.

1917
02:02:10,581 --> 02:02:14,560
Like how do these maniacs,
these fucking derelicts,

1918
02:02:14,690 --> 02:02:18,350
this easy now I guess like how was he
figuring out? You're right, I can hear,

1919
02:02:18,351 --> 02:02:22,250
only figure out how to do it myself.
Know how to do it. I got it, I got it.

1920
02:02:22,280 --> 02:02:26,840
And I have my faculties, he's got
a producer to just, ah, okay. Yeah.

1921
02:02:26,990 --> 02:02:29,870
Like how has the try it out
guy uploading that video.

1922
02:02:29,900 --> 02:02:34,400
How is he airdropping to like, do
you what I mean like her so, right.

1923
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:36,980
How does he even know how to do a phone?

1924
02:02:37,490 --> 02:02:41,270
Probably it's so true.
But what's it's probably happening,

1925
02:02:41,630 --> 02:02:45,680
which is so much more ridiculous cause
he's probably like I made this video,

1926
02:02:45,681 --> 02:02:50,681
I want to upload it and he has to like
show someone like post this like yeah.

1927
02:02:51,950 --> 02:02:55,010
And then someone's like, Oh what is
this? I'm just talking about something.

1928
02:02:55,250 --> 02:02:56,960
And then they,
they have to take him through the sub.

1929
02:02:56,961 --> 02:03:00,300
Do you have a youtube account and
here's how you express it. And then,

1930
02:03:00,610 --> 02:03:04,040
and then you want to throw a title on
it, year four strokes and then, okay,

1931
02:03:04,700 --> 02:03:07,700
what's your thumbnail?
What's Amil you get to pick on that video.

1932
02:03:07,780 --> 02:03:09,600
You like this a lot better now.
It's fine.

1933
02:03:09,601 --> 02:03:11,210
It just needs to get out there right away.

1934
02:03:11,240 --> 02:03:14,830
And what led to him being
like gotta shoot this. Yeah,

1935
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:19,400
I'm just getting my was the conversation
right before. That's what I'm saying.

1936
02:03:19,401 --> 02:03:22,270
He was having lunch with this brand cause
you can actually, you know, rest right.

1937
02:03:22,450 --> 02:03:26,570
Restaurant my shelter. So yes, people
have said it's a halfway house.

1938
02:03:26,630 --> 02:03:28,640
It seems like that it's
probably what it is.

1939
02:03:28,641 --> 02:03:31,700
Somebody shooting dice right off camera.
You're right. That's interesting.

1940
02:03:31,701 --> 02:03:36,470
We haven't thought about the moment
before. All these videos. That's it.

1941
02:03:36,471 --> 02:03:39,010
You know what I've been talking about
this. That's it. Going to share it.

1942
02:03:39,050 --> 02:03:40,460
I keep sharing it with tables.

1943
02:03:40,461 --> 02:03:44,510
A dude's and no one believes me
putting this message out there.

1944
02:03:45,470 --> 02:03:49,740
He's like GM, I'm telling you, it
goes from a little limp Dick. Yeah,

1945
02:03:49,850 --> 02:03:52,760
to a hardware. It's prompted
by some guy who's being like,

1946
02:03:52,761 --> 02:03:55,890
you never things I stopped smoking crack
and I get hard. No. Yup. Something like,

1947
02:03:55,891 --> 02:03:58,400
you know what I mean? Like I've had
sex with six months and he's like,

1948
02:03:58,850 --> 02:04:01,790
you know what really works? And then
that guy was like, that does that.

1949
02:04:01,791 --> 02:04:03,160
That's not true. He's like, Oh yeah.

1950
02:04:03,490 --> 02:04:08,210
He got fired up as someone who didn't
believe his story. I gotta be honest,

1951
02:04:08,211 --> 02:04:10,190
like I were a guy's struggling with,

1952
02:04:12,740 --> 02:04:15,990
I would like maybe be like, oh, I'm
gonna have something to this mouth.

1953
02:04:16,130 --> 02:04:19,900
Like he kinda got through to me.
I just want to tell your listeners like,

1954
02:04:20,070 --> 02:04:21,200
you will not do math,

1955
02:04:21,201 --> 02:04:23,930
do math if you've never done math and
you think it's going to give you a hard

1956
02:04:23,931 --> 02:04:26,210
dick. Like don't let that be the
reason you get involved with,

1957
02:04:26,211 --> 02:04:30,420
well no neuropathy issues.
But doctor drew is our biggest,

1958
02:04:30,421 --> 02:04:34,890
Dick was Dr Dre was saying that you
shouldn't do math either to get a doctor

1959
02:04:34,910 --> 02:04:39,910
came on and he was like never like this
is not a very good formula for erectile

1960
02:04:41,671 --> 02:04:44,330
dysfunction.
It works for him.

1961
02:04:46,110 --> 02:04:50,550
That's the thing is like
bringing the family and, and,

1962
02:04:50,820 --> 02:04:52,740
and he also went from like,

1963
02:04:53,340 --> 02:04:58,320
my brother didn't believe me and then he
believes me now meaning like there was

1964
02:04:58,321 --> 02:05:00,830
a time where like he was telling his
brother, his brother, the pros like you,

1965
02:05:00,831 --> 02:05:04,980
you would just match and the stick thing,
you're always talking about it.

1966
02:05:06,780 --> 02:05:10,230
He's like, give me the fucking pipe. And
then went through with and then was like,

1967
02:05:10,231 --> 02:05:13,590
I'm gonna pull my dick out right now, and
he dragged off in front of his brother.

1968
02:05:13,650 --> 02:05:18,520
I mean
probably happened over a month.

1969
02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:22,440
You know how you like to be courted
for my would look like he did it to his

1970
02:05:22,441 --> 02:05:25,570
brother. [inaudible] story
of this video. I need to know

1971
02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:32,200
how much of a frenzy was he in before he
stop.

1972
02:05:32,270 --> 02:05:36,420
I hate that.
To leave and the spirit,

1973
02:05:41,560 --> 02:05:43,230
you can be it.

1974
02:05:43,530 --> 02:05:46,620
Your ticket become so sensitive
to keeper become so sensitive

1975
02:05:50,150 --> 02:05:52,710
for straight people and gay people.
That's the funny thing.

1976
02:05:54,170 --> 02:05:59,070
Humans can do it.
Very inclusive drug promoter.

1977
02:05:59,150 --> 02:06:01,680
He was like, what are you trans by?
You can do it and you can try it. Yeah.

1978
02:06:02,470 --> 02:06:04,890
There's so many other
like good reasons to do.

1979
02:06:05,020 --> 02:06:08,490
The math seems like fun for other reasons.

1980
02:06:09,310 --> 02:06:10,720
Like energy,
the pick me up,

1981
02:06:11,210 --> 02:06:15,000
you clean your house
collage is being made.

1982
02:06:16,040 --> 02:06:19,590
I just never heard the side effect
of it. It's pretty cool. Pretty cool.

1983
02:06:20,010 --> 02:06:22,200
You don't hear about the good sides
to Matt. This is what you're saying.

1984
02:06:22,220 --> 02:06:26,940
How positive the Dicks of math was.
Never a Siri. You know the faces of Meth,

1985
02:06:26,941 --> 02:06:31,050
we saw that a face deteriorates.
We didn't see those.

1986
02:06:31,170 --> 02:06:34,800
The Dick's through that chart, you're
sort of just gotten harder and harder.

1987
02:06:34,830 --> 02:06:38,640
Brilliant. Again, you with the
good point. So we've never,

1988
02:06:39,780 --> 02:06:43,080
you just created a new meme. The dicks
of met. We're going to get a few posts

1989
02:06:45,810 --> 02:06:47,530
as they come for like zombies.

1990
02:06:48,780 --> 02:06:52,650
I don't like how he says sensitive
either though. Santa Tf. Yeah,

1991
02:06:52,651 --> 02:06:55,530
he's got a bit of a lift.
It became,

1992
02:06:55,560 --> 02:06:58,840
it had become so sensitive,

1993
02:07:00,250 --> 02:07:04,620
thick, hot, whack. Me Ask you this, Nikki,

1994
02:07:05,160 --> 02:07:10,020
do you prefer thick, hot white?
Come to just watery come.

1995
02:07:10,050 --> 02:07:12,270
Do you know what I mean?
Like why is that a thing for him?

1996
02:07:12,540 --> 02:07:17,430
But it has to be thick and
it's not healthy

1997
02:07:21,090 --> 02:07:23,580
are my husband's got so many.

1998
02:07:24,120 --> 02:07:26,400

called horrible are hilarious.

1999

fucked up or funny and we'll get you out

2000
02:07:30,601 --> 02:07:33,810

to go. Is this funny to you?

2001
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:36,810
Ah,

2002
02:07:38,300 --> 02:07:39,133
how much you liked it?

2003
02:07:45,270 --> 02:07:45,830
Okay,

2004
02:07:45,830 --> 02:07:48,290
here it is. Tell me what you
think. Okay. Okay, here it is.

2005
02:07:49,480 --> 02:07:50,313
It's all,

2006
02:07:53,290 --> 02:07:54,123
Oh,

2007
02:07:54,820 --> 02:07:55,653
Oh,

2008
02:07:58,990 --> 02:08:03,670
horrible. Horrible. Horrible.

2009
02:08:04,300 --> 02:08:08,210
Okay. Today. I hate it.
It bounced off the tray.

2010
02:08:08,430 --> 02:08:12,560
You know he's okay. He's fine. He's fine.

2011
02:08:12,590 --> 02:08:16,520
He's not watching. He landed
on a trashcan. I know,

2012
02:08:16,521 --> 02:08:19,490
but I do not like that at
the trashcan wasn't there.

2013
02:08:19,630 --> 02:08:22,430
We wouldn't even play
because he would not be fun.

2014
02:08:25,570 --> 02:08:26,403
Yeah.

2015
02:08:28,900 --> 02:08:32,840
Yeah. But you had to now, but you had to
assuage her fears that he wasn't dead.

2016
02:08:32,850 --> 02:08:36,960
So funny. Let's just play this out. Sure,
sure. You don't have to convince me.

2017
02:08:36,980 --> 02:08:41,460
Hold on a second. I already closed it.
God Damn it. Where to go was like a,

2018
02:08:43,030 --> 02:08:46,690
it sounds like a fire rocket going off.
And then just like even hear him.

2019
02:08:48,190 --> 02:08:49,023
Yeah.

2020
02:08:55,050 --> 02:08:58,560
Alright. Both of your associate pads. Now
I'm convinced she's associate bad deal.

2021
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:02,760
Just that fun. It's so
funny. As long as he's,

2022
02:09:02,780 --> 02:09:04,040
I thought you were wanting from us.

2023
02:09:04,660 --> 02:09:09,390
Nikki. I, you are a woman of
sympathy. Oh, okay. He's okay.

2024
02:09:09,510 --> 02:09:14,440
He's okay. That's okay. The screams.
Oh No, no, no, no, no. He's not good.

2025
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:16,060
Oh,
he's definitely not good.

2026
02:09:16,910 --> 02:09:21,340
That's a good screen screen.
It's funny. It's, yeah.

2027
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:22,233
I mean,

2028
02:09:22,950 --> 02:09:27,840
I don't like watching it get hurt.
That's funny. This screams silly.

2029
02:09:28,260 --> 02:09:29,093
Okay.

2030
02:09:30,280 --> 02:09:32,930
A, yeah. Yeah, he's fine.

2031
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,770
What's this one? This
is in here. What is this

2032
02:09:46,440 --> 02:09:50,490
they do in Japan? No, no, no.
What is that? What are they
doing? They do a prank show

2033
02:09:50,990 --> 02:09:55,790
where they set up cameras and
like if you're being pranked,

2034
02:09:56,480 --> 02:10:00,430
I get shot in the like,
it seems like someone broke in and

2035
02:10:00,540 --> 02:10:03,360
shot me shit out of this one guy.

2036
02:10:03,361 --> 02:10:07,250
He's scaring one person to think that like
people are being shot around him. Yes.

2037
02:10:07,420 --> 02:10:09,600
There's a mass shooting.
Like there's a fucking

2038
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:19,580
like that's the prank there.

2039
02:10:22,300 --> 02:10:25,830
Tom's laughter and joy and I like
that at all. It's pretty bad.

2040
02:10:25,831 --> 02:10:28,800
I mean that guy is going to
have PTSD from that. Yeah.

2041
02:10:29,010 --> 02:10:32,270
There's certain breaks I don't like
to, yeah. When it's too mean spirited,

2042
02:10:32,300 --> 02:10:33,930
he's like, oh, don't fuck with him.

2043
02:10:34,570 --> 02:10:37,670
No. For the snap. I
already hate it. I hate it.

2044
02:10:37,700 --> 02:10:39,760
I know what's about to
happen yet and I ain't got

2045
02:10:42,570 --> 02:10:46,760
no date. Your finger, you
find your through your bank,

2046
02:10:48,860 --> 02:10:52,360
that accent plus an animal
in a video equals yeah.

2047
02:10:52,450 --> 02:10:54,850
The animals and I can never get time.
Oh whoa.

2048
02:10:59,420 --> 02:11:01,960
Oh Johnson

2049
02:11:08,490 --> 02:11:09,041
the alligator.

2050
02:11:09,041 --> 02:11:11,530
And now they're going to toss it in
the corner cause they're mad at it.

2051
02:11:11,570 --> 02:11:15,030
But you didn't know they just did it. It's
animal abuse. Oh, I hate it. I hate it.

2052
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:18,220
May I interject a point here
about these crocodiles? Uh,

2053
02:11:18,250 --> 02:11:21,840
I don't know if you know this. It was a
cast member on road rules Australia, uh,

2054
02:11:21,850 --> 02:11:25,810
and run nine, late nineties. I forget
why. Anyways, we did a crocodile farm,

2055
02:11:26,920 --> 02:11:31,480
whatever mission I think. And he was so
cool. I got to hatch a baby crocodile.

2056
02:11:31,670 --> 02:11:33,490
Oh yes.
Now here's the thing.

2057
02:11:33,910 --> 02:11:38,020
Within seconds of that thing coming
out of its shell, it bit me what,

2058
02:11:38,080 --> 02:11:42,290
and those teeth are hard. They're
sharp as fuck. So that baby car,

2059
02:11:42,291 --> 02:11:44,710
that was a baby crocodile. Oh.
And that thing was like a team,

2060
02:11:44,711 --> 02:11:48,970
like a preteen one maybe. Oh my
God. And so when they're born,

2061
02:11:48,971 --> 02:11:53,050
they're extremely painful.
That was really cool. Yeah.

2062
02:11:53,051 --> 02:11:56,920
And then they wanted us to cut up a
pig and serve the pig parts to the

2063
02:11:56,921 --> 02:11:59,050
crocodiles. And I was like,
I think I'm a vegetarian.

2064
02:11:59,200 --> 02:12:01,720
Like they handed us machetes and they're
like, cut up the pig. And I'm like,

2065
02:12:01,750 --> 02:12:05,500
I can't. I'm sorry. I can't. And I
became a vegetarian for like a week. Wow.

2066
02:12:06,160 --> 02:12:10,710
That's all week. I last until we went to
Mcdonald's and I had to eat. Okay. Yeah.

2067
02:12:10,740 --> 02:12:12,290
Yeah. One more. They call it in Australia.

2068
02:12:13,010 --> 02:12:16,460
Oh, I don't like this one. Oh,

2069
02:12:16,461 --> 02:12:19,550
I hate balloons.
Better do something.

2070
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:25,360
What? Oh no, it's a pair
of the light is fine. Yeah.

2071
02:12:33,630 --> 02:12:37,930
Hang on. Hang on her. Oh God. Ah.

2072
02:12:38,380 --> 02:12:42,270
See how she's laughing? Tom, do
you see the joy in making space?

2073
02:12:42,300 --> 02:12:44,530
So it seemed like it was an
even split with Nikki though.

2074
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:48,940
Thud into that dumpster. I hated that
video at first, but then the side,

2075
02:12:48,970 --> 02:12:51,490
just when I close my eyes,
the sound, the sound is good.

2076
02:12:51,491 --> 02:12:55,360
The sound is funny on the skier.
He, yeah, that was funny. Yup.

2077
02:12:55,570 --> 02:12:59,230
But I don't want to hear, oh,
someone breaking their leg.
Sure. That's awful, right?

2078
02:12:59,231 --> 02:13:03,940
That that's a normal reaction I'd say
to, all right. Everyone's learning,

2079
02:13:04,660 --> 02:13:05,493
everyone's learning.

2080
02:13:05,720 --> 02:13:09,980
I have a bunch of girls here.
If you've seen my regular sites,

2081
02:13:09,981 --> 02:13:14,780
you'll see there's suddenly all kinds
of pictures of me at other girls and

2082
02:13:14,781 --> 02:13:16,610
videos is going to be
showing up very shortly.

2083
02:13:16,611 --> 02:13:21,100
We'll have a big party here this weekend
that was all swollen.

2084
02:13:21,101 --> 02:13:24,730
So yes, I thought it, you know, being
healthy. I mean whole bunch of vegetables.

2085
02:13:25,300 --> 02:13:30,160
Oh No. Yeah. Oh No. I'm not sure
that was the best idea. No. Okay.

2086
02:13:30,161 --> 02:13:31,920
Well that was an in futility.

2087
02:13:42,500 --> 02:13:43,333
Oh,

2088
02:13:45,120 --> 02:13:47,830
why would she, do you have any
idea how long ago was holding that?

2089
02:13:49,810 --> 02:13:54,360
Was that a rooster? Yeah, I
switched to be proud of her.

2090
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:58,260
I'm proud of her too. I love that. I've
felt like anxiety from you. You're like,

2091
02:13:58,261 --> 02:14:01,890
what's that?
She was going to break something now,

2092
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:05,340
don't you feel as a lady,
I don't know if you feel the same way.

2093
02:14:05,341 --> 02:14:08,850
Tell me if you do that.
These fart videos are just,

2094
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:11,610
you're just leaving money on the table
if you're not doing them as a woman.

2095
02:14:11,960 --> 02:14:15,030
I mean, I was just the way I do about
being like, eh, that's, that's fine.

2096
02:14:15,060 --> 02:14:18,540
Easy money. What'd you do it if
you're like, I'm having that. Never,

2097
02:14:18,630 --> 02:14:23,290
never ever, ever, ever but not,
okay. Here's the thing though,

2098
02:14:23,340 --> 02:14:28,340
we're putting your brain $50 our
reality right now into that scenario.

2099
02:14:29,130 --> 02:14:32,230
What if you're like, fuck,
I need like this would be,

2100
02:14:32,340 --> 02:14:36,000
I can make 500 bucks in an hour this
afternoon that would pay my rent or

2101
02:14:36,001 --> 02:14:40,650
whatever. You don't want
to be someone some day that
like people like, no, I just,

2102
02:14:40,770 --> 02:14:41,970
I would rather starve.

2103
02:14:42,340 --> 02:14:47,340
What if you wore a wig and you call it
called on that dog mask right there and

2104
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:52,410
you're like woo name's Cara and
then you know you just have a home.

2105
02:14:52,700 --> 02:14:56,760
A run for our money. Yeah, I mean
see what I'm saying? I am a Vegan.

2106
02:14:56,790 --> 02:15:00,000
She said she would kick people in
the balls. How are you having anal,

2107
02:15:00,001 --> 02:15:04,160
you're a Vegan and my shit all
day. And you go, I do. It's great.

2108
02:15:04,170 --> 02:15:07,230
Really hot in here too.
Cause it's like the 90 outside

2109
02:15:09,270 --> 02:15:14,100
this woman. So I'm in a room.
It's a hero. I kinda liked her.

2110
02:15:14,160 --> 02:15:17,250
I liked her too. I respect
this a lot. It's really high.

2111
02:15:21,270 --> 02:15:25,040
That one's all right.
Listen,

2112
02:15:25,730 --> 02:15:26,780
why not profit?

2113
02:15:29,630 --> 02:15:32,170
I would do it in an assault.
Guys, fucking lameness.

2114
02:15:32,210 --> 02:15:34,580
There are so many freaks out there.
They'll love this stuff.

2115
02:15:34,581 --> 02:15:38,510
That's what I'm saying. It's easy
money. Oh, she's out of breath.

2116
02:15:39,890 --> 02:15:44,030
Had knocked the wind out of her.
She's out. She read. She said,

2117
02:15:47,480 --> 02:15:51,110
oh no.
Like,

2118
02:15:56,690 --> 02:16:00,680
oh my God. So this woman does
these videos for people a lot.

2119
02:16:01,190 --> 02:16:05,270
Now I would chosen dried apricots.
That makes up the front girls weekend too.

2120
02:16:05,330 --> 02:16:08,120
So she's just like, girls, I gotta
gotta do some content. They're like,

2121
02:16:08,121 --> 02:16:10,160
what's your channel?
Do you do like arts and crafts?

2122
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:11,900
You know what I'm telling
you about it later

2123
02:16:13,870 --> 02:16:15,890
and she can you imagine
them just like putting,

2124
02:16:15,891 --> 02:16:18,950
they're putting a cup up to the
door to hear what she's doing.

2125
02:16:19,010 --> 02:16:21,800
What is she doing in there? What
is her, is she into Asm Mar?

2126
02:16:21,801 --> 02:16:26,440
That would be kind of a weird,
right, because she's doing
an Asr Marvin. No. Yeah.

2127
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:30,040
I love this, this new design,
this new level of like, what's the

2128
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:33,430
conversation before somebody who stops
what they're doing and makes these videos.

2129
02:16:33,431 --> 02:16:35,850
You're right. It's just like,
what was she doing before this?

2130
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:39,810
In between going to the beach with
the girls and like dinner, you know,

2131
02:16:39,860 --> 02:16:42,890
you have the downtime where everyone
kind of like goes off into their own

2132
02:16:42,910 --> 02:16:47,740
getting dressed, just like Kinda,
some girls are napping and she's just,

2133
02:16:47,950 --> 02:16:52,790
you know, making some fart
content. Some money. Yes. Money.

2134
02:16:53,050 --> 02:16:57,040
She is awesome. Yeah. Um, look, Nikki,
it's always fun to have you here.

2135
02:16:57,041 --> 02:17:00,970

gotta get you Outta here for something.

2136

2139
02:17:12,610 --> 02:17:14,570
I haven't been there in so long.
I'm so excited.

2140
02:17:14,570 --> 02:17:17,260
You have to eat at the restaurant
across the way there. Oh my God.

2141
02:17:17,261 --> 02:17:21,980
The greenhouse tavern. Yeah, that sounds
good. God. Okay. Okay, sounds good.
