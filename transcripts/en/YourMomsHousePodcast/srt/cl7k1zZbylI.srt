1
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,290
Well go to your mom's house,

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,393
Christina.

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,010
You should see me when
we drive by a bike store.

4
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,860
You should see me when we
drive by a bike store. Bye Bye.

5
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:48,550
Bye Bye.

6
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,950
There you go. That was cool. It was
called stranger bikes and it's by,

7
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:32,600
uh, let's see. Snick and Steven
Snick and Steven. But it says,

8
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,690
I like that. There you go. You
know, I like, I really like that.

9
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:39,380
Stranger bikes playing off
of the stranger things theme.

10
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,050
I can't wait for that show to come back.
It's coming back dude.

11
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,180
When now I guess there's
a big uproar right now.

12
00:01:44,181 --> 00:01:47,990
People are upset that they didn't renew
since eight. Oh, I couldn't get into that.

13
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:51,110
I tried and I couldn't.
Did you try? Uh, I don't.

14
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,920
I saw the pilot. That's the only thing
I saw. I couldn't give it. Yeah, I,

15
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,320
and they do it. Can I tell you we was a
bunch of people all over the world, right?

16
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,330
The different paths.
Superpowers,

17
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,210
like one guy can come a lot and then the
other lady miss that episode entirely.

18
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,360
He didn't know that. Nope. And
they all go on to come strike. No,

19
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,640
I think you're confusing
that with something else.

20
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,540
One of them can talk to Hitler.
No, no, no. I don't think so. Hmm.

21
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,800
I don't think that can happen.
We tried watching last. Rob,

22
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,060
is that what you guys, did you do your
exercise this weekend while I was away?

23
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,340
Yeah, I did. I worked on it.
How many did you get through?

24
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,870
I got through 50, but that's
getting, that's progress.

25
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,530
Your first 50 strokes,
you'd get 300 strokes and,

26
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,640
and then possible have an orgasm.
Just not ejaculate.

27
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,320
Orgasm happened on the inside. How
do you, I hear that happens when you,

28
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,950
when you get snipped, Rob, Rob, rob

29
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,200
that you, the beginning. I
don't think you forgot anything.

30
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,560
When you get snipped, when you get
a vasectomy. Oh, that you might not,

31
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,520
I don't think you make a buck in the
beginning and then you make something. No,

32
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:06,850
doctor drew was saying that he doesn't
have any juice that comes out cause he

33
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:11,680
had, uh, he had, he had a, his
testicle cancer. Sorry. None
of us like to me. Oh yeah.

34
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,750
Yeah. Because I mean, you still have seen
it, but not the potent load. Yeah. Yeah.

35
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,240
No sperm they'd know per minute sperms.
Perms.

36
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,250
Perms like shrimps. Yeah.
Sperms. Sperms. Yes.

37
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:28,630
People do miss pluralize
that sperms shrimps a lot.

38
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,410
I hate that. Especially if
they just had an espresso. Oh,

39
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:34,930
I gave that or they just
came from the library.

40
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,340
The Espresso one makes me the
most upset cause I hear uh,

41
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,390
servers and Baristas.
Yeah. And they're like,

42
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,570
and you want an ex extra shot of espresso
in that? Yeah. How do you work here?

43
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,530
You should know. And you've read
it on the menu and overheard. Yeah.

44
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,500
Stupid fuck sperms sperms.
Um,

45
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,330
so it was a, Oh, so we,

46
00:03:56,331 --> 00:04:01,331
we tried watching yesterday
after porn ends to hoping,

47
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:01,530
yeah.

48
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,000
To find, oh, oh, oh yeah.

49
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,430
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

50
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,280
Hoping to find some gems in there like
we did with the other porno documentary.

51
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,860
Yeah. Where is, she was like, she did
that hooker math section, a segment.

52
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:24,780
And remember that was the best to a dye.
I remember the math. Go ahead and math.

53
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:29,250
We're not good at math. The math,
the hooker math was you get like,

54
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,930
I dunno, $500 to shoot a scene. Right.
Going over it. She was like, yeah,

55
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,990
but they offer you to let
a guy come inside of you.

56
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,140
Yeah. And internal surprise. Uh,

57
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,170
an extra hundred dollars. Right. She goes,

58
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,260
so you get an extra hundred bucks.

59
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,680
He comes inside then, you know, uh,
the morning after pill, the plan B,

60
00:04:54,681 --> 00:04:58,920
it was only $40 $40. So that's 60
bucks I got to keep in my pocket.

61
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,450
It's a win win is all I gotta do
is let this, it, I don't know,

62
00:05:03,451 --> 00:05:07,920
common me on camera. So that's
neat. It's immortalized forever.

63
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,420
What's wrong with that? But you
get extra 60 to 60 bucks. Huh?

64
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,630
Like I was telling you if
it, if, if she had been like,

65
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,740
and then for like a guy to finish inside
and I get another $400, we were like,

66
00:05:19,741 --> 00:05:23,370
well, you know, that's, that makes
sense. Okay. That makes sense.

67
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,400
$400 would be worth a guy doing that
just to show you like what scumbags the

68
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:30,420
like that industry is run by.

69
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,530
They don't even go like here's
140 so the 40 you get the plan B,

70
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,360
you get getting make $100.
They're like, you figure it out,

71
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,900
whatever. You got it done. You maybe you
want the kid who knows so don't you. Yeah.

72
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,860
Jesus. So we were looking for some
gems, but apparently these porn stars,

73
00:05:49,861 --> 00:05:53,310
they followed or too smart and they
figured out how they were going.

74
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,480
I think we got to keep on,

75
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,040
I think we should finish it because
if you notice they would to uplifting

76
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,240
for me.
Well they would go,

77
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,750
they would go different types of
stories like up and down. Right.

78
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:07,520
So like they would do one person who
was like, that was biased back then.

79
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:11,300
And now I'm having, you know,
I'm retired and, and yeah,

80
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,390
and then so like that's a kind of a
sweeter story. Then you go to the,

81
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,770
the guys that I have aids and you're like,
oh shit.

82
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,750
And then they go to the lady who was like,

83
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:24,140
I had a lot of fun doing it and you
know, I was crazy, blah blah blah.

84
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,830
So I think we should, I think if we keep
watching, we're going to get somewhere.

85
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,120
Yeah. You know, maybe fun. But it
definitely wasn't hooker. Hilarious.

86
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:36,490
Yeah. Give me those hard knocks stories.
I know his was like, man, his HIV story,

87
00:06:36,491 --> 00:06:39,180
you're like Jesus.
Well to his credit he looks great.

88
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,930
Like he really seems to
maintain his body well and,

89
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,300
and he's working out a lot
and he seems happy. Oh my God,

90
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,240
God that dude is like so extra yoked.

91
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:52,910
But I think you gotta be juicing right
to be on that. Have that body. Yes.

92
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,930
Especially with an auto immune disease.
Definitely.

93
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,370
My Dad was telling me about that.
Um,

94
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,440
about some of these
bodies you see on people.

95
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,400
So like if you don't know top dog who's
obviously been on this show a million

96
00:07:03,401 --> 00:07:04,234
times,

97
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,160
he was a competitive
Olympic lifter for years.

98
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:14,190
I mean from the time he was 13 till about
29 or 30 and he would working out six

99
00:07:15,911 --> 00:07:20,860
days a week, most of his workouts
were like three hours plus.

100
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,270
Like these guys were maniacs. And he
goes, you know, I was in great shape.

101
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:30,130
I was a two time state champion.
I was ranked nationally. He goes,

102
00:07:30,131 --> 00:07:35,050
I didn't have like the body that you
see some of these guys have. Oh Wow.

103
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,740
Somebody who is lifting every
everyday and eating steak every day.

104
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,740
They can potatoes every day,
every day.

105
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,230
This was before supplements or vitamins?

106
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:48,480
No roids he's just like I work
out, I eat a steak. Yeah. Data.

107
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,323
And that was what he did.

108
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:54,390
But it's interesting because you see
these days you see crazy bodies soap,

109
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,430
especially in men like
super, um, sculpted,

110
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,920
you know statuesque bodies and,

111
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:07,630
but it's also the era of like people
taking growth hormone and and uh,

112
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,320
and test out, you know
like sure. Access. Yeah,

113
00:08:11,321 --> 00:08:13,540
access all these things
because what with him,

114
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:17,830
like I've seen pictures of him and his
and his is like super competitive lifting

115
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,630
days.
It looks like a super fit guy,

116
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,380
but you don't see like
muscles kind of and a falling

117
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,660
down really defined and
the veins and all that.

118
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,660
You and your dad are built
like brick shit house is,

119
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,470
I say sure. Yeah. Not a shit brick
house. I always get it confused.

120
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,600
You do say that a lot of the,
but you guys are built for a,

121
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,990
that you're very sturdy and Ellis has
that back to you guys have brought the

122
00:08:39,991 --> 00:08:43,440
shoulders and the back for it.
We have the same blueprint.

123
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:46,680
My Dad just took it in the direction
of working hard at it. Yeah,

124
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,560
right. Yeah. But your genetic, I mean you
lift weights. We've got way too. Yeah.

125
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,460
You Know Jim, whatever. No, I
could, I could pursue it more heat.

126
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,840
But like we were talking about his
workouts one time and I was like,

127
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,610
fuck that dude. I mean he was competitive.
That's different. I mean I wouldn't,

128
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,470
I don't have the desire to do what he
was doing and I both have that lazy gene

129
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,730
counteracts any sort of wanting.
I forced myself to swim and do pilates,

130
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:13,470
but I hate it.
He also had a group,

131
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,500
this is the thing that they would lift
a as like a team and he goes like if you

132
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,320
left early or skipped any day,
um,

133
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:29,040
the other guys would ride you so hard
about it that you were like, fuck that.

134
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,760
Like they would only go on dates after,
you know what I mean? So if it was like,

135
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,700
Hey, I'll pick you up on Friday and
you go like seven, I'd be like, no,

136
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:40,710
nine 30 after I'm done. Yeah.
When I'm done. Listen. Wow.
So they were so into it.

137
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,510
That's cool though.
It's good fucking 30 sets of squats,

138
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,980
like not to you,

139
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,370
but your dad is the type of personality
who really likes structure and

140
00:09:50,371 --> 00:09:52,950
discipline and focus and like having that,

141
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:58,230
you know what I found a unrelated to
this really interesting watching that

142
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:01,200
documentary was like,
she was an old lady now,

143
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:05,760
but she did like the devil and Mrs. Jones
or whatever that porno is the old ass

144
00:10:05,761 --> 00:10:07,990
one, by the way. She looked fucking

145
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,490
old.
Oh,

146
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,030
she liked the Rob Rob Guy.
But uh,

147
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:23,390
so they showed them a picture of her
nude and I was startled by it because

148
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:28,890
you're like, oh yeah, that's what
human bodies looked like prior. Nice,

149
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:30,750
normal bottom.
And it was beautiful.

150
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,920
But I forget what normal
bodies look like in print.

151
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,190
Human bodies with natural
breasts that just,

152
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:41,610
that that laid normal and
they weren't enormous.

153
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,610
Quadruple d fuck my
triple d slept wife tits.

154
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,700
I know in platinum blonde please,
please, please, please, please send out

155
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,590
face. It looks like it's drawn on
like she's in like she's in shock,

156
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,800
the photos and eyebrows and wonder what
the aesthetic is the pop like how did

157
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:06,410
that, how like looking at different
looking women obviously, you know like

158
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,520
variety. Yeah. And it's exciting to
see, you know, but like hungry. Why did,

159
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,640
why it went to like,

160
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,960
as like that's hot cause
I don't feel like that is,

161
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,610
I don't know which committee decided that
all porn chicks have to look identical

162
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,990
because I mean like there are men who
like hungry or tits and begged shots and

163
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:31,020
different shape faces are interesting.
Different noses, different, you know,

164
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:34,200
all that Shit is interesting.
I know what I think it isn't hair.

165
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,610
I think the beginning was Pam Anderson.
Honestly, I think sometime around her era.

166
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,540
You're right. People went, oh, the
gold standard is blonde is fuck.

167
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,890
Huge tits. Tiny, tiny waist and Barbie.

168
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:49,860
It's essentially Barbie.
Even actually know the porn stars body.

You're not part of the ta staff

186
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,020
Pr. Public Relations. You're
not part of the transsexual. Oh,

187
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,680
adjustments staff. Are
you a ta? Transgendered?

188
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:46,510
What's your end Pronoun? Brona
down. Sorry. Ended. Are you?

189
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,740
Hold on. Yeah. You didn't even, you
just assumed my pronoun. That's true.

190
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,600
I did really assume it.
When are we going to see non-binary porn?

191
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:54,760
I can't wait to see all that
stuff. The only, that's kind of,

192
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:57,430
of course that's coming. Of course
it's coming. What's Your Pronoun?

193
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,920
I was on Instagram. You know, I love
Instagram. Instagram is my favorite.

194
00:14:02,921 --> 00:14:06,820
Silver isn't it? The best is I
like photos. I like, you know,

195
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:11,830
looking at a photo and deciding like,
that's enough information for me.

196
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,940
It's enough. I like a nice
caption of photo. I'm done.

197
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:20,470
I like it because you really get insight
into people's mental illness. It's not,

198
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,620
you know, one thing I saw, the
cursory that I realized is,

199
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,360
is fucking super weird to me.
Hmm. Not Weird. It's just I go,

200
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,590
hmm. Hmm. Well, I love cars.

201
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,940
I've always been in love with
cars since I was little boy.

202
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,390
I like playing with toy cars or like
car magazines. I just love cars. Yeah.

203
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,260
But you'll find somebody that has,
you know,

204
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,360
a photo like let's say a phone, oh,
this guy in front of his car. I'm like,

205
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:52,100
I was beautiful car,
go to his page and his page

206
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:57,350
is nothing but him and his cars.
And you're like,

207
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,410
it's, it's just like, it's too much. Yeah.

208
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,020
And it's also like this guy defines
himself entirely by what he has.

209
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:10,080
That's interesting. You know,
there's that. That's, so
that's how the guys do it.

210
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,860
Yeah. Now the girls do the
body, the girls do the, well,

211
00:15:13,861 --> 00:15:18,150
what's interesting about the body thing
is that they take half naked pictures.

212
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:18,620
What?

213
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,830
Oh my God, what I got to show
you? I just got this text. What?

214
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,260
The bottom read the bottom.
Oh. Oh my God. Tonight.

215
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,720
Oh my God. What do I do? Uh, I dunno.

216
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,850
We'll have to figure this out. Should
we press pause? I think so. Shit.

217
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:42,560
All right. Got some exciting show business
news for Tom, which we can't reveal.

218
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,470
Yeah. Well, I mean, yeah, I didn't
mean to be so dramatic. Obviously.

219
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,540
You are basically, um, it's,
it's, I mean, I can say this,

220
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,500
it's just like I had an audition
and they want to see me again,

221
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:58,790
so it's next level. So that's awesome. And
it's very exciting. And will everybody,

222
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,800
everybody cross your sphincters
for Tommy caused crusher be holes,

223
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,950
so it's all good. Yeah. Big Excitement.
Good. Good week for the Sigora House.

224
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:14,480
Not going on. Yeah. What were we
talking about before the surprise? Um,

225
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,420
Fudge Oh, scamper. Snapples

226
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,840
well,
where are we talking about?

227
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,470
We're talking about while we were talking
about the porno thing before the break

228
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,330
bodies bodies. Um, and then
I played this fucking guy.

229
00:16:27,331 --> 00:16:29,070
So do you want to know what
that setup was for that,

230
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,600
why that guy was flipping out? Yeah,
so apparently there was this, uh,

231
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,430
this is,
okay.

232
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:40,190
I'll tell you what the thing
said here is that the guy there,

233
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,750
there was a,

234
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:45,750
an incident occurred at the International
Longshore Warehouse Union in Longview,

235
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:46,854
Washington.

236
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,420
And reporters were there to ask about
a hostage situation that happened weeks

237
00:16:51,421 --> 00:16:55,630
prior. So six guards were held
hostage for a couple hours,

238
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,940
um,

239
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,940
after 500 or more long shore men broke
down gates and smash windows in the guard

240
00:17:02,191 --> 00:17:07,170
shack. And this long shoreman is in
no mood to answer these questions.

241
00:17:07,171 --> 00:17:08,130
So in other words,

242
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,480
this is something that's been like in
the news and this and this news reporter

243
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:14,610
is just like, Hey, I want
to ask again. You know,

244
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,130
or ask more about the
incident that happened.

245
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,200
I ain't called him macaque bite,
which is really funny.

246
00:17:19,201 --> 00:17:23,100
I've never heard that one before. Right.
It is amazing. Talk by, that's a great,

247
00:17:23,101 --> 00:17:26,760
yeah. Wow. I love it. You
had that isolated already.
You knew that was a winner.

248
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:31,880
Yeah. Cock bike. Yeah. So this is a shark
bite. This is how the whole thing unfolds.

249
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,160
This is the guy showing up,
the news guy going like,

250
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,280
oh, hi, I'm with you.

251
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,910
And just wanted to know if there was
anyone here want to talk to us about the

252
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:50,160
situation from where actually you
can go down and fill out talking to

253
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,950
egg. They'll tell you how they're
fucking the longshoreman around here.

254
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,470
That's the gentleman who gets more
upset and then I guess you see that the

255
00:18:02,471 --> 00:18:06,130
camera man,
one of them starts filming something

256
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,420
printed out.
Hey,

257
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:14,280
none of your fucking business you cocked,
bite miss you a trespass.

258
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:17,320
You get the fuck out of here now.
Get outta here.

259
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,910
Don't fuck with me partner.
You're not the PR staff. You,

260
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,260
I liked it.
That guy maintained his sense of humor.

261
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,660
I also think it's funny that the guy goes,
unless you want trespassing,

262
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,990
like not if you want to be
charged with trespassing,

263
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,300
like unless you want robbery.
Right. He's just, he's,

264
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,810
he missed conjugated is under stress,

265
00:18:41,811 --> 00:18:44,390
under stress and it's understandable,
but I think he keeps saying it.

266
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:49,100
You want trespassing?
Like you want something to drink,

267
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,210
wasn't trespassing on with you.

268
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,093
Trespassing.

269
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:02,600
He might be drunk.
Jammer broke you cock sucker.

270
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,100
Just wanted to hear your by now or

271

You know you're going to get trespassing.

272
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,100
You're going to get charged with
trust or you know, I'm, I'm an,

273
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,330
I'm going to say you are
trespassing or you are trespassing.

274
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,330
Trespassing is what you said.
You're going to get it.

275
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,030
You're going to get are going to

00:19:33,511 --> 00:19:36,120

You guys have a library here
doing a paper on the shrimp.

281
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,533
Oh,

282
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:46,490
Do you know what you dumb mother fucker.
You like, you're fucking glasses.

283
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,670
Don't fucking threaten me.
You son of a bitch.

284
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,590
Get the fuck out of this parking lot.
Right?

285
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,080
Get outta here.
Now

286
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,700
why is this guy fucking with
him? I liked the, uh, he has.

287
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:04,810
Here's a great disposition though,
Cameron. At least he's like,

288
00:20:04,811 --> 00:20:07,990
I'm just doing this man. He's
done this a 500 times. Yeah,

289
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,610
he's seen people lose
their mind. Like, I don't,

290
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,170
you don't get to hear people
yell like this anymore. You know,

291
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,210
you don't really get to see it.
Cock bites and stuff.

292
00:20:16,211 --> 00:20:19,170
I feel like I haven't seen people
freak out like this in a minute. Yeah.

293
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,940
I miss it. We just pull
these all the time. People.

294
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:27,520
That's exciting to me because I like
seeing people get upset like that.

295
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,840
Especially if we're funny.
You know this guy is,

296
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:36,030
he's upset because there is a buildup
of people asking this that you don't get

297
00:20:36,311 --> 00:20:38,860
to see. In other words, usually
when someone loses their mind,

298
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,880
it's not over something
reasonable. Right. It's,

299
00:20:40,881 --> 00:20:43,450
it's because something
builds up over time.

300
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:48,550
This guy has been asked these questions
for six weeks. Original trigger. Yes.

301
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:51,550
And he's mad at you. I'm mad at this
guy. He's mad at the fucking man.

302
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:55,230
The first for a second hundred reporters
that came. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

303
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,770
This is pretty good.
It's so funny,

304
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,610
Texas.
I'm not going to touch that cock sucker.

305
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:04,990
I fucking cold cocked him in a heartbeat.
Why? Get out of the fucking parking lot?

306
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:10,990
Fuck you. You Cock sucker. That's
why name fuck you talk soccer.

307
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,550
Okay.

308
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:17,050
Yeah, I did get him down. That's his
name. Fuck you. That's fine. Fuck you.

309
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:21,700
Cock sucker. That's my name. I miss the
shit. Yeah, we gotta get more angry clubs.

310
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:23,450
Again,
I forgot how fun these are.

311
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,460
And if we could go around the room
and everybody just state your name.

312
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,960
Yeah.
Your Cock sucker.

313
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,670
Right. Hi. Fuck you.
You cogs are good. Talk,

314
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,130
bite bite.
And I missed the racist ones.

315
00:21:37,131 --> 00:21:41,430
Remember when he's like you
fucking Spec. I'm sorry. Huh. Huh?

316
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,630
Screaming over the fence.
That was again, one was great.

317
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,930
I wonder if this sock my pussy.
That was good.

318
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,850
We been while that guy was
um, our kiss my pussy. Yeah.

319
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,730
Not Suck my policy that no

320
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,760
mother
these long shoreman though.

321
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,890
I wouldn't fuck with these
guys. Well, you know,

322
00:22:03,891 --> 00:22:08,780
are these guys do real work for real,
real fucking men?

323
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,580
Oh, our old landlord, uh,

324
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,880
one of our past landlords was
a longshoreman and he was not,

325
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:18,080
he was a very gentle, sweet guy, but he
would tell stories of his, uh, you know,

326
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:23,040
yeah. Coworkers be a gnarly dudes. Yeah.
So my real gnarly, real gnarly. Where,

327
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,350
why worser shit. Just got, why water? Uh,

328
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:29,910
I was at the Arrow Puerto
yesterday, bright and early and, um,

329
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:35,410
I was listening to people talk on their
phones and the rage inside of me is kind

330
00:22:36,301 --> 00:22:39,920
of like that, like the cock
bite. Yeah. Rage where you're
like, what are you doing,

331
00:22:39,921 --> 00:22:41,690
asshole. You know? And
especially in this era,

332
00:22:41,691 --> 00:22:46,691
people feel okay about watching videos
on their phone at full volume in public,

333
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,510
like who's,
and nobody's correcting this behavior,

334
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,010
but the phone conversations insidious
because you're on the receiving end of one

335
00:22:55,011 --> 00:22:56,750
side of a conversation.
Yeah.

336
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:00,820
And I think when it's way worser is
when it's in a foreign language. Yeah.

337
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,960
And now I, I don't even understand
what the fuck you're saying.

338
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,480
And your language sounds horrible to me.
And is it,

339
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,890
I think the worst language,
I don't know what he was,

340
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:15,360
it may have been Vietnamese only because
they don't have a volume control.

341
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:20,570
I know. It's so loud. It's on like, dude,

342
00:23:20,571 --> 00:23:24,230
you know that you're in public.
Yeah. Why are you fucking,

343
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:28,430
it's it's and yelling in your
language and it's, listen,

344
00:23:28,431 --> 00:23:32,650
we spoke Hungarian growing up in
my house, but you know what? Yeah.

345
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,880
What was that speakerphone feedback?

346
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,480
What we didn't do in public, you speak
Hungarian because it's rude and it's,

347
00:23:41,481 --> 00:23:44,240
it excludes people. Yeah.
You know what I mean?

348
00:23:44,241 --> 00:23:49,100
You speak fucking English when
we were public asshole. The, the,

349
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,600
the speaking in another language in
public because you really have a secret to

350
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:58,670
excluding. Yeah. Yes. It's
disrespectful to the, you know,

351
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:03,671
I see this shit all the time where
people hold the phone in front of them.

352
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:07,870
They're like, stop it right
here. Right now. Stop it. Yeah.

353
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:12,570
Go on at the airport. Yeah. Stop it. Yeah.

354
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,050
Yeah, I know. And you're like, dude,

355
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:20,000
like no one wants to hear this whole
fucking thing. It's never about, you know,

356
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:24,920
it's not, it's not about who won the Nobel
prize or uh, you know, quantum theory.

357
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,860
It's always like, we're going to meet
you down at the baggage claim. All right.

358
00:24:27,861 --> 00:24:31,910
Yeah. Okay. Well, Susan gun to bring the
cake. Yeah. She's going to bring the cake.

359
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:37,520
Like what are you doing? It's total
like it is that some people have,

360
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,653
um,

361
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,610
total disregard for the world
around them and for other people.

362
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,670
I don't even know if the book,
I think some of it is conscious.

363
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,210
I think it is conscious. Like they want
you to hear what they're talking about.

364
00:24:50,211 --> 00:24:53,240
Sometimes feel like it's a something,
you know,

365
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,743
it's like

366
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,353
I important

367
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,650
you're standing there and you're like,

368
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,773
Yep,

369
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,153
interesting.

370
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:14,580
None of us are sitting here minding our
own business because that's the thing

371
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:16,350
that stands out is that everyone,

372
00:25:16,351 --> 00:25:21,150
literally everyone else
in those situations is
considerate of everyone else.

373
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:25,350
That's why that person stands out.
You're the only one doing, doesn't care.

374
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,300
Okay. What's your least favorite
language though? Let's get into that.

375
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,480
I'm going to go with, I don't like
Russian. I have a bias though.

376
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,440
We all have biases.

377
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:38,250
Don't we can say is that I don't like
rushing because culturally that's my tribe

378
00:25:38,251 --> 00:25:41,220
ish. There are cousins. Uh,

379
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,160
so that hard sounding eastern bloc shit.
Yeah.

380
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:47,580
My shoulders go up around my
years and never said, by the way,

381
00:25:47,581 --> 00:25:50,460
as someone who has no connection,
it doesn't sound good to me.

382
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,570
I don't like your brushes.
Yeah.

383
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:01,680
I like hearing, I had to pick like, I
don't mind hearing the romance languages.

384
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:06,330
It just sounds soft, Freddie.
I mean Portuguese. Yeah.

385
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,840
Those are all like, when do you
get to hear Portuguese? And Paul,

386
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,740
I seldom get you hear that.
But I'm saying like it's not,

387
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,070
but when you hear like homicide
it, I'm a halogen, Amazon,

388
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,600
any language

389
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,190
Israeli,
go back to your fucking country

390
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:32,270
regardless. Regardless. I'm
saying I don't give a shit.

391
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,920
I'm not talking specific cultures.
Don't care.

392
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:40,320
Drawful language. What's
bothersome? Doesn't sound beautiful.

393
00:26:40,321 --> 00:26:45,030
I'm not at all just nice. That's
not, is it terrible? Yeah. But uh,

394
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,200
but I, I need to, yes.

395
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,360
I know that somebody's
Farsi speaking English.

396
00:26:52,021 --> 00:26:55,750
Like that is why it works.
Or two awful, awful. Yeah.

397
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,560
We're going to get,
now that they're at the market,

398
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,440
there's no onions and
you're like, Jesus, dude,

399
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,970
it's worse than you can't understand it
cause you're like your conversations so

400
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,500
dumb. Yeah. God, it's so boring.

401
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,190
People would just repeat the same things
to each other over and over. It is,

402
00:27:11,191 --> 00:27:11,880
there is a split.

403
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,400
There are people that are oblivious
because you can look at someone with the

404
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:16,890
fuck are you doing here?
They're like, I don't know.

405
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,820
And then there's people that
it's a what it is. It's,

406
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,410
it's a an attempt to show power.
Yeah,

407
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:29,220
because what you're saying is like,
yeah, this is a moment where I can,

408
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:34,170
I'm going to talk loudly in this room,
dominating the space with my voice.

409
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,220
You assholes have to hear when I'm
talking about why time you and I were at a

410
00:27:38,221 --> 00:27:38,840
hotel,

411
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:43,740
we were coming out of a nice restaurant
and there was some guy on his speaker

412
00:27:43,741 --> 00:27:46,260
phone, I don't know if you remember
it, but we were getting a valet.

413
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,650
We're waiting for the valet
and full, full volume, like

414
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,260
from like sounding like Ivory
Coast something and saw all,

415
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:00,040
I mean actually I enjoyed him
because I liked that accent, but the,

416
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,260
it was just, he was so
loud. Yeah. It's so,

417
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,620
it's just so deep and when you're tired
and you're in the airport, you're like,

418
00:28:07,621 --> 00:28:10,560
I don't want to, I don't want to hear your
fucking, I don't want to hear you bro.

419
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,010
I agree a lot of,
ah,

420
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:17,340
basically I don't want to hear your
conversation period or your video or the

421
00:28:17,341 --> 00:28:18,750
music.
The worst.

422
00:28:18,751 --> 00:28:23,010
One time I was sitting next to a
girl watching Korean soap operas.

423
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:28,910
Here's how a Christ loud some people are
as I'm on a plane a week ago and a kid

424
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:36,120
has his iPad or whatever, or
some toy, boop, boop, boop,
boop, boop, boop. And I'm like,

425
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,920
hey. And I look over and then his parent
was like, Oh, don't forget that one.

426
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:45,030
Like it was helping him be shit
again. Yeah. And you're like,

427
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,590
why don't you tell your kid to turn that
down or lunch? Give them headphones.

428
00:28:47,591 --> 00:28:50,730
So headphones, the rest of us
don't have to hear PPP. PPP,

429
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,820
it's obnoxious.
You are obnoxious.

430
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,930
One time I was on a plane and
a guy was watching his movie,

431
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,130
but he had his earbuds and,
but the volume was pumping out full,

432
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,790
full volume and it was a late night
flight. And I'm eyeballing him,

433
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:07,440
eyeballing and finally I go,
excuse me,

434
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:12,210
could you listen to that on your ear
phones? And he goes, oh, I thought I was,

435
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:14,190
I'm so sorry. And He, and
then he plugged it in.

436
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:18,690
That was the one time I did actually see
a person last week do the same thing.

437
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,920
Right.
I didn't correct him,

438
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:23,820
but what happened was a couple of
sitting next to each other and star wars

439
00:29:23,821 --> 00:29:27,570
started. You can hear it in
the cabin like Dun, Dun, Dun,

440
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,300
and I see them going out with
their headphones and they're like,

441
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:37,580
and then, and then all of a sudden
the guy goes, we're not plugged in.

442
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,870
I plugged it in, but that was,
it's funny. Different, right?

443
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:45,490
Like he's trying to civilized human
people are fucking psychos though.

444
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:50,120
It's it. It really is to the advent
of the, the cellular phone. Yeah,

445
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,210
it's the iPhone etiquette.
We really haven't,

446
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:55,630
we haven't figured out yet what
proper etiquette is for the phone.

447
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:58,600
I think that'll be, hopefully in
the next few years, people go,

448
00:29:58,601 --> 00:30:01,840
all right at dinner.
It shouldn't be on the fucking table.

449
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,460
There should be an iPhone
etiquette school or,

450
00:30:04,461 --> 00:30:08,250
or just societal norms that we should
all adhere to from now on. Agreed.

451
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,130
Or it's my first order of visiting
anything now, by the way. Oh boy.

452
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:17,080
Not going to answer that. That's
a set up. Of course it is. No,

453
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:20,410
it isn't. I'm reading a
book right now. Red Notice,

454
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:24,760
what does that red notice?
Is there a lot of pictures in there?

455
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,000
Zinged you just reading it
interesting. Uh Huh. What's that about?

456
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:36,300
It's about this guy who has his
grandfather started the communist party.

457
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,520
Oh cool.
And then he went on.

458
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:42,550
It's a Russian basically
real life thriller.

459
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,870
So it's my enemy basically.
Yeah.

460
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,890
But as an entire spiel about the Russians.

461
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,710
So I'm in the part
right now where he's um,

462
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:55,330
it was basically introducing how he
came to work. He's a businessman,

463
00:30:55,570 --> 00:31:00,310
but in eastern Europe. Oh, very cool. So
I didn't know you were interested in that.

464
00:31:00,311 --> 00:31:02,800
You should talk to my dad about that.
He loves Connie and this stuff,

465
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,660
but you're not reading anything right now.

466
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,390
Okay.

467
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:10,990
Course. I read stuff all the time. But
what are you reading right now? Uh,

468
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:15,370
it's called the, the something
of the gifted child. The,

469
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:18,070
it's called the something
of the gifted child. Yeah.

470
00:31:18,071 --> 00:31:20,920
I read a child psychology books,
so I don't fuck up our kid.

471
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:25,630
The drama of the gifted child. This lady
has a review of that right here. Okay,

472
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,650
here we go.
I was reading it.

473
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,663
Hmm?

474
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,750
Oh Shit.
She's not even talking yet.

475
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:44,230
That was my mistake. Okay, here
we go. It's reading the book.

476
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:53,710
Yeah. Footage of me
reading. I read kindles.

477
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:54,544
I don't read that.

478
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:02,280
Mike
is like a monster.

479
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:08,800
Pretty good review, right? Um, is that
what the dream? That's the same thing.

480
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,310
Do we get fart Mr Com?
I think we did last week.

481
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,620
I think we need to start
doing something with it.

482
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:23,750
I'm surprised nobody had fart
mistress. I know. I'm really well,

483
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:27,820
it just goes to show that the women doing
the fart videos aren't that creative

484
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:30,070
and that I could really put
a dent in that industry.

485
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:33,280
Really sell that to somebody.
You know. Fart mistress.

486
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:36,460
I mean to a real fart
mistress. I would love to. Hey,

487
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:39,070
anyone out there want fart mistress?
This one owns it.

488
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,850
I'll sell it to you
for a reasonable price.

489
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,500
That's a long foof.

490
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:52,700
Whoa. That was a really
good one. Really crazy.

491
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,190
That's almost ass rapper.

492
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:59,220
That's how my mother spoke English
when she first got to this country.

493
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,300
It's like she would call a fan of monster.
I remember that little months took me,

494
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:09,080
cause she didn't know how to say fan
like monsters make noise with this lady

495
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:12,740
said that her ass is like a monster. It's
pretty neat and it's kind of accurate.

496
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,400
I didn't, you have quite a uh, Brown
day. I'm so glad you brought that up.

497
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:24,310
You may want to hit the all board
brown. Oh really? Oh okay. All right.

498
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,760
He didn't know that was coming.
Hold on.

499
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,940
So I went to a man friend
disco this weekend.

500
00:33:39,941 --> 00:33:42,760
Thank you everybody that came out
to my shows. They were super fun.

501
00:33:42,761 --> 00:33:45,370
It was really great.
I had a lot of fun,

502
00:33:45,371 --> 00:33:48,220
met a lot of mommies and so anyways,

503
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:53,340
on Saturday I go have Thai food by my
hotel on the Embarcadero there and I don't

504
00:33:55,091 --> 00:33:57,910
eat fucking honkie food. You know
what I'm saying? When I want flavor,

505
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,090
I guess some God damn flavor
will supposedly San Francisco.

506
00:34:01,091 --> 00:34:05,170
I mean you have so many great choices in
San Francisco to head to like eat real

507
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:09,400
authentic. Yeah. That loves the food
there. So I go to this Thai place,

508
00:34:09,401 --> 00:34:11,740
I ordered my Panang curry and I was like,

509
00:34:11,741 --> 00:34:14,710
you make that shit spicy and don't
make it fucking white girl spicy.

510
00:34:14,711 --> 00:34:17,380
Like I want legit heat on that bitch.

511
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:21,640
I actually have a bit in my act
right now about that is a seriously,

512
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:27,010
seriously, is it because I ordered that
way at Korean barbecue so much? No, no.

513
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,840
I demand that they give me spicy
sooner. They'll go, oh, okay.

514
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:32,943
Any hurdles?

515
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:38,020
I order it and I ask for spicy and
they bring it out and I'm like,

516
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,960
Oh shit. Like they
really, it was too much,

517
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:45,340
but I couldn't send it back because
I demanded it, you know what I mean?

518
00:34:45,341 --> 00:34:49,120
So I had to eat the dish anyways
and push through the pain.

519
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,870
It was hot as fuck dude. They,
they didn't hold back on me at all.

520
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:57,190
So like I have to do this, like I
can't, I have to save face. So I eat it,

521
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:58,750
I forget about it,
I'm fine.

522
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:04,020
And then showtime rolls round and the
farts begin and I'd forgotten what I'd

523
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,320
eaten earlier. I was like,
why are these farts here?

524
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,750
You know when you do that where
you kind of are like, I'm farting,

525
00:35:10,751 --> 00:35:13,390
but I'm not sure why.
And then it occurred to me,

526
00:35:13,391 --> 00:35:15,760
I had that Thai food and
it was like mystery solved.

527
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,850
So I sit down to make brown
and I'm having so many paint,

528
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:23,080
it's so much pain because
the farts are really violent,

529
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:27,100
like hard farts and I fucking,
I'm shitting,

530
00:35:27,101 --> 00:35:29,020
I'm shitting and it's showtime.
Now I'm getting,

531
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,570
I'm getting text messages
from the club like, Hey,

532
00:35:31,571 --> 00:35:35,650
the show's at seven 30 you know that
right? And I'm in my show outfit,

533
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,100
like tights dress and I'm like,

534
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:43,460
I'm shitting and it's bad and it's like
a multi wiper and I don't have time to

535
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:46,790
go shit to shower because it's showtime.
Like I've,

536
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:52,800
I just had to keep, rub, rub, rub, wipe,
wipe, wipe, wipe, neverending wipe.

537
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:56,460
There's, I've leaky. But there's
so much toilet paper in the bowl,

538
00:35:56,461 --> 00:36:00,360
there's so much brown in the bull.
It was so painful. So I flush

539
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:02,983
and,

540
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,920
and I'm like call it went
down and then the water rises,

541
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,050
did the, the, the

542
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:14,940
starts to spill a little, little, little.

543
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:19,830
And then miraculously it
slowly goes back down.

544
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:23,250
So it goes under when you told me that

545
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,610
turns on the ground reminded me
of Jacksonville. That's right.

546
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,030
That's where tourists were on the comedy
zone and that's where I had turns on

547
00:36:33,031 --> 00:36:36,150
the ground and I had to tell the hotel
staff that there were two on. Yeah.

548
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:06,220
Classic.
My Jam right there

549
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,670
on the ground.
I heard you on the ground

550
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,633
on the ground.

551
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,550
Simpler made that.
That was really good.

552
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,830
So I got really close to
tourists on the ground,

553
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:38,250
but no turrets on the ground in San
Francisco. But it was close. Dude.

554
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,800
Tariff is bad and I didn't,
like I said,

555
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:44,670
it was just like a leaky but situation
all night I kept wiping. It was terrible.

556
00:37:44,671 --> 00:37:49,020
Yeah. Do you get that too? I forget
what the never ending wipe were like.

557
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:53,700
You just keep wiping almost god.
It's so upsetting.

558
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:58,050
You know that brings up, this actually
came in, you brought this up right now.

559
00:37:58,051 --> 00:38:00,360
This isn't planned.
Look, this email came in.

560
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,313
I swear to God.

561
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,880
How do blind people know to stop wiping?
Hey Hitler's. I've been a big fan of,

562
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,600
so this is mommy.
Tina was in Fart next a few months ago.

563
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:18,960
I've been binge listening
you 40 plus hours a week

564
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:23,550
having every second of it.
I'm not all the way through,

565
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,260
but I've always wanted to know one thing.

566
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,620
I believe you're the people that helped
me find out how do blind people know

567
00:38:28,621 --> 00:38:33,540
when to stop wiping. How have we gone
this long without knowing this age?

568
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:36,160
Old Question.
Thank you for everything you do.

569
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:40,920
Look forward to the next
time you are in Fart. Nixon.

570
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,460
This is the funniest thing
we've never discussed.

571
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,310
I feel like we may have discussed it.
Feels familiar.

572
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:53,640
I really do think we'd discuss it but
I think it's been a long time. They,

573
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:58,740
I asked one time they wipe a bunch and
then they do a bare hand wipe and they

574
00:38:58,781 --> 00:39:00,460
smelled it.

575
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:08,650
They have a dog do it.
Seeing eye dog. No, no, no.

576
00:39:08,651 --> 00:39:12,310
It's a reasonable question I think.
I think the dog sniffs or be home.

577
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,550
I think it was brown. I think you know,
I think you just get a sense of it.

578
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:18,190
Just like a a feel because you're so,

579
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,360
you're so tied to your vision
and helping you eventually.

580
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:26,020
Like I think what happens is it becomes
intuitive and they just go, I'm done. Now.

581
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:29,950
It's a good theory. Well, if you're blind,

582
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:34,410
I guess have someone write in for for
you or you could write in how do they do

583
00:39:34,411 --> 00:39:38,200
it? They don't think they can take, right
either. They don't type on an email.

584
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:42,100
Sure they do. Are they have
Braille keyboard type? You
use your Braille keyboard.

585
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,750
Yeah.
Let us know.

586
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:48,280
Let us know how you got all
these mysteries and tell us
about the learning curve.

587
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:53,530
Tell us about bad times. You guessed
wrong. Don't just be like, yeah,

588
00:39:53,531 --> 00:39:55,900
of course I know how to do it and tell us.
Give us a little insight.

589
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:01,150
This is so important.
The work we're doing on your mom's house,

590
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:03,010
like when I asked if we're trying to,

591
00:40:03,011 --> 00:40:06,520
people knew they're retarded and now
we're going to find out if blind people

592
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:09,010
know how they're done wiping.
That's pretty influencing.

593
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,190
We're really helping society.
We are helping a lot.

594
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,770
We haven't yet mentioned that.

595
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,080
Pretty soon we're going to
be joined by a guest today.

596
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:23,010
Mr Aristotle Schaefer is coming
in really short for Aristotle,

597
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:28,520
not his name. Definitely not.
No, I wasn't Jewish. No, no.

598
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,480
It's a Greek name. I
know that. Um Oh wait,

599
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:37,570
I feel like I have more thoughts on
this blind wiping situation though.

600
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,540
Uh, yeah. Okay. Do you have
any more opinions on it?

601
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:44,890
Are you saying that thinking about it,
I feel like that's a wild okay.

602
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,580
Oh here's what I was gonna say.
Cause sometimes browns are misleading.

603
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:52,780
Like the other week I had what I thought
would be a disastrous cleanup. Yeah.

604
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,780
I think it was hot and I was like,
oh this is going to be a nightmare.

605
00:40:56,110 --> 00:41:00,360
And I went to wipe and the paper
was totally clean. Yeah, it's not,

606
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:05,140
it's just not a, a shirt,
a science, you know? Yeah.

607
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:10,510
Are you texting airy? What's he doing?
Just letting them know one time.

608
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:15,700
I don't know. I hate when people
are late. Let me to, Oh God,

609
00:41:15,701 --> 00:41:18,310
I just fuck you know what? I thought it
was funny as an man friend disco that uh,

610
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,430
the women were talking about,
cause when I lived there in the 90s,

611
00:41:21,431 --> 00:41:25,060
it was hard to find a boyfriend
cause all the dudes are gay now.

612
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:29,050
Now they're not now.
They're not all gay now they're all nerds.

613
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,260
I here because of the tech industry
moving up there that there's a lot more

614
00:41:33,261 --> 00:41:37,850
straight guys,
but that they're all socially not adapt.

615
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:42,320
So they're all dorks. Big
Old dorks. Yeah. You're,

616
00:41:42,321 --> 00:41:45,930
the whole tech industry has moved into
that area. It's completely changes.

617
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:50,600
It's also priced out basically the whole
city. It's terrible. It must be hard.

618
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:53,450
It was hard when I was living there and
now it's got to be way worse than I ever

619
00:41:53,451 --> 00:41:56,840
want to move to another city
though. Yeah. But then I go,

620
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:01,670
not la like I just remember it's
not la and then I go back here.

621
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:04,190
But don't you ever want to live
in a city city again though or no?

622
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:08,790
Not with the kid. I think
it's to get rid of him. Now,

623
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:12,140
here's what's hard about SF.
Is that just getting groceries?

624
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:14,750
Like you don't have a car there cause
it's so hard to have a car because there's

625
00:42:14,751 --> 00:42:17,390
no parking. You still want to
live on the ocean though, right?

626
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:21,740
Ocean beach front 100%. You
love Moraine. I live in Marin,

627
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:27,380
Marin county across the Golden Gate
Bridge there and would live in here in La

628
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:31,510
County. If you live anywhere. Beach beach
side, anywhere mountain Maribou. Yeah.

629
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:37,250
Besides, uh, Santa
Monica. Monica Santa. No.

630
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:41,740
Redondo. Venus Manhattans for no,
like Manhattan Man's to Broey.

631
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:45,520
Sometimes for me it boils down her most
is actually the mode that's to broey.

632
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:49,160
Yeah. For Life. Yeah. Like maybe
you're the fucking thing bro. Yeah,

633
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:53,240
but now I like more seclusion. I don't
like as many people at Palo Sverre days

634
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:55,820
so far though.

635
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:01,310
I know our Oxnard's too far north.

636
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:06,260
I know the most desirable places are
the ones here and they're so expensive.

637
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:10,490
I know. Can I tell you why I want
us to retire though? Maui, Maui,

638
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:14,840
we're all like the, the nut bet. Like
the Wayne Dyers, the Doreen Virtue's,

639
00:43:14,841 --> 00:43:17,690
all these nut bags that I like.
Like we're all the,

640
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:21,190
the meditation retreats are like
with Ron doss again to Maui.

641
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,160
I've never been there either, but I feel
like you and I would really enjoy it.

642
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:28,400
Wrote down. I think you and I would
really dig Hawaii. It's like a retirement,

643
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:34,370
eh, Eh, Eh,

644
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:38,780
I don't really mind telling Nike. Yeah.
That was crazy fun. Fuck yeah it was,

645
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:41,340
but I wouldn't live there cause there
was only like 3000 people on that,

646
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:45,450
too small. Not too small, but I
always got it going on and that's,

647
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,160
that's pretty accessible.
We can eat snack,

648
00:43:47,161 --> 00:43:50,150
a Damien nuts every day
cause they're there. That's,

649
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,000
that's where they come from. Row
Out of the ground. They're there.

650
00:43:54,001 --> 00:43:58,530
You just walk around in their
snack. A Damien net. It's
everywhere. People just go.

651
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:01,410
Do you want a glass of pineapple?
Pineapple.

652
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,340
That's right guy. You're so smart.
You're so smart. Can we talk about our,

653
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:11,640
Our dad's day and my smurf day yesterday.

654
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:15,380
Yesterday you Sir Paul Mccartney.
Yup.

655
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:20,520
My niece Grayson. Yup. Some other kid,
Isabella Rossellini all had birthdays.

656
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,240
Yeah, yeah, sir. Paul Mccartney.
That's what he likes me to call him.

657
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:29,490
And Sir Paul and I spent the
morning stuck on a plane.

658
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,550
I woke up, I slept for
three hours, was fun and uh,

659
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:37,140
but you got me this gorgeous ring. Thank
you very much. It's a really outstanding,

660
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:40,290
I'm going to wear it on my specialty
thing. He did a wonderful job.

661
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,020
You don't know when you buy jewelry for
someone. You're like, did I do well?

662
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:46,500
I love it. No, until they actually, you
can tell by the reaction. You were like,

663
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:50,820
what? You know why? Because I'm so
eastern block that I immediately think,

664
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,710
how much did you pay for this?
I don't deserve this.

665
00:44:52,711 --> 00:44:55,380
I don't want to wear something expensive.
I get that.

666
00:44:55,420 --> 00:45:00,420
Or a card or Ellis is college. Yeah.
I'm glad we spent it wisely. Yeah.

667
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:04,710
Well I get on him to go to Yale for
four years or do you want to eat a ring?

668
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,470
That's what I decided on. I know. I
just get weird about jewel jewelry.

669
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:13,950
It's a nice ring jewelry. That's how
you say it. Jewelry, not jewelry.

670
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:19,370
Jewelry is free and wanted a contest
as you get this shooting hoops.

671
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:22,263
Yeah.

672
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:27,740
Well then so you got me the super nice
ring and you got me some PJ's like

673
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:33,180
talking about Pj's and you put your pj's
on at night. I'm not really a PJ guy.

674
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,590
No. I like boxers, but
it's one of those things.

675
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:42,150
Do you ever have things where you go,
you imagine you want to be that thing?

676
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:45,420
You know what I mean? Like, yeah.
I'm the same way with robes.

677
00:45:45,421 --> 00:45:47,700
Basically I see someone in a robe.
I'm like,

678
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:52,140
I want that row and then I get a robe.
I use it twice. I know I lose it.

679
00:45:52,141 --> 00:45:53,480
I forget where it is in the house.

680
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,910
Pj's I see someone in a and like an a
catalog wearing their and I'm like, ah,

681
00:45:57,911 --> 00:46:00,350
it looks so comfortable.
I like sleeping in boxers.

682
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:03,510
That's how I feel about high heels.
Like I'll buy a pair. I wear them.

683
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:08,460
Once you write the exception for the
PJ's thing is sometimes they make like

684
00:46:08,461 --> 00:46:12,480
sleep shorts or the
real loose baggy shorts.

685
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,130
I like those to sleeping,

686
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:19,740
but I don't like an actual Pajama
Ensemble. You know, I don't wear it.

687
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:22,920
It's a little corny for guys.
Some guys are into it. You know,

688
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:26,410
those guys are non your reward for those.
Yeah,

689
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,110
they're definitely challenging
the intersectional narrative,

690
00:46:31,111 --> 00:46:35,700
if you know what I mean. I
read that too. It's to cry.

691
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,960
It's just like the gays that somebody,

692
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:43,860
this orange is the new black actress
is non binary and somebody for real

693
00:46:43,861 --> 00:46:48,770
mountain bike and she really is out
and she's, she's really, how are you?

694
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,720
What's your name? What's Your Pronoun?
You're gonna die. You're gonna die.

695
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,910
Can I read you what she wrote today?

696
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:58,300
Her name is a Asia Kate Dillon.
She's,

697
00:46:58,301 --> 00:47:01,580
she's one of the white
girl white supremacists
character. So your name again?

698
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:06,630
Asia.
Kate Dillon.

699
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,970
And she plays one of the,
like I said,

700
00:47:08,971 --> 00:47:12,960
one of the white supremacist girls on
orange is the new black. So she wrote,

701
00:47:12,961 --> 00:47:17,250
I think people receive my message of
being nonbinary and feeling she's really

702
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,310
pretty and she's a great actress.
Uh,

703
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:24,600
receive my message of being nonbinary
and feeling gender identity as a spectrum

704
00:47:24,601 --> 00:47:25,740
better because I'm white,

705
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:29,560
was assigned female at birth and
on a super popular television show,

706
00:47:29,561 --> 00:47:33,100
Asia answers. Honestly, my friends
who were assigned male at birth,

707
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:33,851
people of color,

708
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:37,450
particularly those who identify as
Fem have an incredibly hard time.

709
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:42,100
They're ostracized, ostracized, and
there are very few safe spaces for them.

710
00:47:42,101 --> 00:47:45,160
I'm grateful for my visibility and the
conversations that are happening now.

711
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:47,710
And I just, I like the
comment. So someone wrote,

712
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:51,340
thank you Asia for complicating the
narrative and keeping it intersectional.

713
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:55,930
I don't even know what that means
either as why I love it. Oh wait. Okay.

714
00:47:55,931 --> 00:47:58,240
So she's on this new show.

715
00:47:58,241 --> 00:48:02,720
She's the new non nonbinary Jillian
on billions. Yeah, she's on shift.

716
00:48:02,721 --> 00:48:05,500
You're calling her a she and we don't
know if that's her preferred Pronoun,

717
00:48:05,501 --> 00:48:08,030
but Oh,
you said her again to shit.

718
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:12,540
But this person is on both shows.
Yes.

719
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:17,530
Billions and black. She's just
killing it. They're killing. Sorry.

720
00:48:17,531 --> 00:48:20,830
They're killing it.
There is this other person writes,

721
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:24,850
there's also living in a country where
the language doesn't gender neutral

722
00:48:24,851 --> 00:48:25,391
pronouns.

723
00:48:25,391 --> 00:48:28,690
So you have to invent them and that
makes it harder for people to understand.

724
00:48:28,691 --> 00:48:32,230
All right, so, uh, what else
you got other things going on?

725
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:34,463
Maybe happening.

726
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,920
I don't know why it makes me
laugh so hard on this stuff.

727
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:42,670
I know that God love him. The God
help these people. Remember that kid?

728
00:48:42,671 --> 00:48:46,870
Jesus Christ. Oh, poopy kisses. Memory.
You wanted me to bring back poopy kisses?

729
00:48:46,871 --> 00:48:51,220
Yeah, I made a note of it. Who'd cases?
Yeah. You said to me the other day,

730
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:56,050
we got to bring back poopy kiss. It's a
nice way to spin. So you're farting. Yeah.

731
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:59,180
You're, you're farting poop because
it's a pubic has for your face.

732
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:03,250
Feel like I need to call airy call
arrows. Uh, I don't know. Let me see.

733
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:06,640
Because he doesn't understand. He
doesn't like texts like a normal person.

734
00:49:06,641 --> 00:49:11,350
He has like a flip phone. Yeah. He's
so weird. Yeah, it's super annoying,

735
00:49:11,351 --> 00:49:16,160
Huh? Cheers. I was joking with me. All
right, hold on. He's not dying here. Oh,

736
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,470
he's here. Let's stop for a second. Let's
go get them. Let's challenge. All right.

737
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:23,500
Yeah. We had to, we had to put, we
mentioned it earlier, but it's official.

738
00:49:23,501 --> 00:49:25,210
It's now a thing.
It's here.

739
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,420
Sorry.

740
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:33,100
Guest has arrived. You'll
Joe mother fucker. Yo.

741
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,240
Aristotle Shaffer.

742
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:41,510
So welcome Mary Ari is that
here's my ex and my son on,

743
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:46,470
sorry. Sorry. Hold on, hold
on, hold on, hold on. Gimme
a second. Gimme a second. Um,

744
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:50,670
wait a minute. Nope. Nope.
How about now? Yeah. Oh,

745
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:56,160
can you hear yourself? That's beautiful.
Thank you. Now we got it work though.

746
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:01,410
Is Ari a Hebrew for like, can I get a
discount? What does that actually mean?

747
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:05,190
Yeah.
Actually I hope a bloggers writing this.

748
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:10,870
I will know blogger ever defend the
Jews taking your piss for 15 years.

749
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:16,500
Yeah. What is Arie? Short form? It's all
pronounce Ari. Uh, it is a show for Aria.

750
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:22,550
Arielle Eliahu Aria. It means RDA
means a lion and Hebrew. Oh boy.

751
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,520
A lion. Yeah. Wow. I on my hair
was way more resembling. Yeah,

752
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,220
I think you're meant to have crazy

753
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:31,670
hair. Oh yeah. It was great. Great Hair.

754
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:36,820
I see people now with the bushy fuck, you
know, yeah. Ball. And I'm like, God damn.

755
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:41,240
Yeah. What's your middle name? David.
And in English and in Hebrew it. So Ari,

756
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:44,260
who already

757
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:50,810
are you? David, if you ask
any Jew if their name is not
David, if you would like,

758
00:50:50,811 --> 00:50:54,610
what's your middle name? Just
guest David. By the way, I always,

759
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,030
this always makes me crazy when people
are on as guests on podcasts including

760
00:50:59,031 --> 00:51:03,530
when I've been guest on podcasts and it's
like hey I have something and then we

761
00:51:03,531 --> 00:51:05,560
don't address it forever.
Yeah,

762
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,540
so I think at least once
right out of the gate,

763
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:13,870
let's mention that on July 9th 18th 18th
Ari Shaffir has a Netflix special set

764
00:51:21,501 --> 00:51:25,310
it called. I'll take those two
pennies and it's coming out.

765
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:26,570
It's a double special.

766
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:30,380
Is that actually what that would
be a good name for this special,

767
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,770
I'll take those two petites and the
double special that I would actually work,

768
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,990
I didn't think of it is a double special.

769
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:39,890
Does it work like the way Chappelle's
does where it's like a collection and like

770
00:51:39,891 --> 00:51:42,860
one place and the pills are like,
I don't know why they do it like that.

771
00:51:42,861 --> 00:51:44,210
They're unrelated.
Completely.

772
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:48,910
But that is that yours is actually two
separate things will play. Wow Dude,

773
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:52,010
that's incredible.
I really envisioned it that way.

774
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:52,731
Does that sound through street?

775
00:51:52,731 --> 00:51:57,260
But that's where you really get to finish
a special yeah. Start number two. Start.

776
00:51:57,261 --> 00:52:00,560
I'm going to take a break. Unreal
man. So I don't understand.

777
00:52:00,561 --> 00:52:04,390
So you'll film I'm a year
apart or simultaneous? No,
I filled them summer tat.

778
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:09,260
So I had, I did a cap city
and um, I changed clothing.

779
00:52:09,261 --> 00:52:13,040
I finished it. Thank you. Good night.
And then the claps and I was like, Hey,

780
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:15,530
don't go anywhere.
That's what got like a shitload left.

781
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:18,620
And then I changed clothes on
stage. You changed the, set it off.

782
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:21,200
She just said we left cause I
want it to have a similar look.

783
00:52:21,201 --> 00:52:23,220
So I changed it to like
the lighting switch,

784
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:27,060
just like distressed wood background.
And I changed the back lighting and the,

785
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:27,980
and the foreground lighting.

786
00:52:27,981 --> 00:52:31,540
I flipped him for the second one
and then I changed my clothes.

787
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,490
Similar but different.
I know,

788
00:52:34,491 --> 00:52:36,700
but like why don't you tell them
the kind of the concept? Yeah.

789
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,040
Half of it's about children and my
feelings of it. So it goes up. Your cute,

790
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:45,980
it's fun, right? It's
not exactly a mystery.

791
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:49,560
Why won't you let me touch him?
Is it because of germs or,

792
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,130
or to encourage a stranger?

793
00:52:52,131 --> 00:52:55,760
Strange men naturally good boundaries.
In other words,

794
00:52:56,030 --> 00:53:00,650
some kids his age, uh, uh,
somebody goes like, hey, like that.

795
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:05,390
And they run up and hug him. Our
kid doesn't do this. Trust people.

796
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:12,530
Fuck are you looking for yeah.
Yeah, it's great. Um, I as you know,

797
00:53:12,531 --> 00:53:17,531
have contacts at Netflix and I reached
out and was able to obtain a clip from.

798
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:22,750
Yeah. So here's a little taste better.
The Jews of the Western Wall. No, no,

799
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,593
it's not.
Okay.

800
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,020
I fucking knew it.
I fucking know.

801
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:39,240
And this is not even an
Orthodox Bar Mitzvah is a woman.

802
00:53:39,241 --> 00:53:42,990
Doing it on a lot in my
upbringing is terrible. Wild.

803
00:53:42,991 --> 00:53:44,490
So talk more about your upbringing,

804
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:48,730
the way the children not having kid or
your feelings about children is one.

805
00:53:48,731 --> 00:53:51,000
And then what's the other
thing is about adulthood.

806
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:54,880
So I give it up for kids a little bit.
I understand small parts of them,

807
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:58,240
but then the other side is like a life
where you really just can't have, if you,

808
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,220
if you have like a wife and kids.
Yeah.

809
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:04,510
Like can I give you a perfect example
that like it just shows you kind of

810
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:09,490
different thoughts. Yeah. You, I'm going
to New York. Yeah. And you're like,

811
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:14,170
why aren't you staying for
like a few days? And it's the,

812
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,860
it's the normal thought for a single
guy that doesn't have a family,

813
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:21,130
but like any guy with a family
would be like, what are you talking?

814
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:25,120
Why would I stay there for a few days?
I actually lived most of my life to,

815
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:28,000
you said it once where it's like, Oh man,
I wish I could do it. I think it was,

816
00:54:28,001 --> 00:54:30,070
I moved to New York, like, I wish I
could do that. I'm like, why don't you,

817
00:54:30,071 --> 00:54:33,880
you're like, I'm married. And
I was like, Oh yeah. Hmm. Yeah.

818
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:36,550
I mean I wish I could do it in
the sense that it's like I go,

819
00:54:36,551 --> 00:54:40,220
I wish I could fucking go parasailing
tomorrow too. Right, right, right, right.

820
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,290
It's an enjoyable kind of like, oh,
that's cool you get to, but I mean,

821
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:45,530
I'm not going to do that.
You know?

822
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,310
You know what's funny
when I think about Ellis,

823
00:54:48,311 --> 00:54:52,580
there's only a couple of real things I
I don't like about having a kid like,

824
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:53,920
and this is so stupid,

825
00:54:53,921 --> 00:54:58,350
but I don't like not sleeping as much
as we used to or sleeping in motherhood.

826
00:54:58,390 --> 00:55:00,940
That is the only thing that
really bothers me. Number one,

827
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:03,890
I covered that in a special
tiredness that all you guys,

828
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:09,360
but it's then you weigh it against this
thing called ambivalence where you're

829
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:11,920
able to simultaneously have
contradictory feelings.

830
00:55:11,921 --> 00:55:14,020
I learned about this and not
everything is black and white.

831
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:18,760
I didn't know those things are not and
most people are not black and white.

832
00:55:18,761 --> 00:55:22,450
We tried to make everybody black and
white like that guy sucks. She's great.

833
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:26,830
Killed somebody like I know what the
charity is still works. Of course,

834
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,990
most people are complicated.

835
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,940
It's all good to go to Fiji and that
we're going to have to put off. Right,

836
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:38,110
and that's something we could literally
do. Why don't you borrow? Granted.

837
00:55:38,111 --> 00:55:39,850
I'm not telling how to parent your kid.
You look,

838
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,280
why don't you leave a bunch of
food in a bowl and then just like

839
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:48,010
cover up the sockets
with his little covers,

840
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:52,450
teach them resilience, self
sufficiency. Now your upbringing,

841
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,960
you are orthodox Jews. We know
now. Did your mom wear a wig?

842
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,860
Like is it that Orthodox man? Yeah,
my sister was away all the time.

843
00:55:59,861 --> 00:56:03,280
My mom would generally wear like a hat
except like high holidays and then sure.

844
00:56:03,281 --> 00:56:04,240
Where we're going to had I thought,

845
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:06,070
I think I wonder if she
would kind of wicked anymore.

846
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:09,850
Have you seen her naturally at
home? She's fine. And what was she,

847
00:56:09,851 --> 00:56:13,330
a blonde or something? Naturally
she's been dying her hair for so long.

848
00:56:13,331 --> 00:56:17,470
I think she's great naturally. Is that
possible? Not, yeah, I think she's blonde.

849
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:20,280
Crazy guys.

850
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:24,790
What do you think I should take
the 10 10 flight or the 11:15 PM

851
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:28,030
10 oh, what time are you trying
to get in? Well, that's the thing.

852
00:56:28,031 --> 00:56:29,980
They get in about an hour apart,

853
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:34,070
either our six 45 or seven 45 six 45
to traffic where you're going through.

854
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:38,200
Okay. Okay. Okay.

855
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:41,760
Did it take me an hour and a half to
get to my hotel when I did got them? Oh,

856
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:45,010
it's nothing. I don't know whether
it's no good subway system.

857
00:56:45,011 --> 00:56:47,800
I know why it's a cabs and the union
field won't allow the subway to go all the

858
00:56:47,801 --> 00:56:52,690
way there anyway. So do you think
it's rooted in your, did you do,

859
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,020
did you hate your childhood? Is that
when you man, I loved it. I loved it.

860
00:56:56,080 --> 00:57:00,930
Seriously. Child is the best. What
are you talking about? Oh yeah.

861
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I didn't have a crazy mom was there not
trying to commit suicide in front of me

862
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:11,570
because you think that somebody
with my background with,

863
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:15,280
cause I used to be like that too, where
I was afraid of, I didn't want a family.

864
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:18,580
I didn't really think I would end
up marrying. But now that I have,

865
00:57:18,581 --> 00:57:22,120
and I love it because I
liked the stability and the
security with most people

866
00:57:22,121 --> 00:57:24,730
though. Right. What's going to have kids?
They're like, oh that is what I like.

867
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:29,140
So how, what, what like where, what
was the defining moment for you?

868
00:57:29,141 --> 00:57:29,531
Where you're like,

869
00:57:29,531 --> 00:57:33,430
I know for me I think it's more reason
where I was like for awhile I was like,

870
00:57:33,431 --> 00:57:34,810
of course I'll have kids
we're supposed to do.

871
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:38,140
And then I lost my religion
and then it was like,

872
00:57:38,141 --> 00:57:43,141
and I moved out here 25 and ask you
this when you told me one time about no,

873
00:57:43,421 --> 00:57:45,400
no,
about stopping the religious thing.

874
00:57:45,401 --> 00:57:49,850
How much you research that borrow
Fatone I clip real quick. Sorry.

875
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,580
Was it a light bulb moment?
What was that like abandoning religion?

876
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:57,850
Was it like a one like you're
like fuck that dates back to a,

877
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:01,090
to a thing that it took me like a
year to like ponder in my head until I

878
00:58:01,091 --> 00:58:03,760
realized, oh, but you really
did ponder for a while then.

879
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,800
And what was the epiphany?

880
00:58:05,801 --> 00:58:10,420
Was it that God doesn't exist or that
this particular system of religion is not?

881
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:14,140
I don't have a belief in it. I first,
I was like gnostic where I was like,

882
00:58:14,141 --> 00:58:16,270
I don't know. It was
cute. I was sleeping in a,

883
00:58:16,271 --> 00:58:19,030
in a dorm and he is
Shiva in Israel. And, um,

884
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:22,450
we had a light bulb over the
beds for reading and, um,

885
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:26,760
you could like twist it up and I remember
this, I do see this is the story. Yeah,

886
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:30,460
you can put a cup on top of it. So
John at the light. So I was like, cool,

887
00:58:30,461 --> 00:58:31,294
I can sleep.

888
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:35,320
But then the cop kept like sliding off
cause it's like circular frame to it and

889
00:58:35,321 --> 00:58:37,450
it just keeps sliding off. And I was
like, maybe I'll just turn the light off.

890
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:41,410
But my, my door was like, my window
was like right by the entrance to the,

891
00:58:41,411 --> 00:58:45,040
to the dorm. So I'm like, people are going
to see if I turn my light off and it's,

892
00:58:45,041 --> 00:58:47,530
everyone's like religious Jewish.
You can't do it on Friday night.

893
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:51,260
You weren't allowed to have a
light. Sorry, I skipped. Yeah,

894
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:52,990
you can't use electricity sabbath.
Yeah.

895
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:55,480
You can leave it on I'll all the whole
time or you can turn it off the whole

896
00:58:55,481 --> 00:58:59,660
time. Oh, go on and off. So drowning
it out as, okay. It's still on.

897
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:02,620
You're not changing the spark.
Uh, this is such weird shit,

898
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:05,480
but like a distinction to make.
Yeah.

899
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:11,280
It's funny too how many of those things
are like tied to a practice and they

900
00:59:11,471 --> 00:59:13,540
become symbolic but,
but,

901
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:17,190
but their actual origin is not like,
no,

902
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:22,070
but I'm saying like with food eating,
let's say, right, like people stay away,

903
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,750
I don't know from certain foods,

904
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:27,530
but the origin of that was
like a practical thing, you
know? Right. They would say,

905
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:30,500
yeah, like some, like some
foods wouldn't, you know,

906
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,710
hold well for certain people get sick.
So they go,

907
00:59:33,711 --> 00:59:37,770
we don't eat that and then years later
they don't get sick. That sort of thing.

908
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:41,810
Yeah. Yeah. But why did they
become symbolic? I'm just eating

909
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:42,931
rob.
I was always just,

910
00:59:42,931 --> 00:59:45,280
so the reason we don't need stuff is not
because of like tape worm or anything,

911
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:49,330
just because God said, oh well
nevermind. Practical reasons that,

912
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,100
but that's probably,
if God was invented,

913
00:59:51,101 --> 00:59:54,340
that's probably one of the things
that were in his epiphany though.

914
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:57,610
I the thing wouldn't stay
on, I kept thinking like,
I'll just turn my light off.

915
00:59:57,820 --> 00:59:59,290
I just turn it off,
which you're not allowed to do.

916
00:59:59,291 --> 01:00:00,360
But that was looking to get caught.

917
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:03,430
And then I thought about
it later where it's like,

918
01:00:03,431 --> 01:00:06,220
who am I worried about
getting caught by man or God?

919
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:10,930
And if I really believe in God,
who didn't want me to do that,

920
01:00:10,931 --> 01:00:14,260
then I wouldn't even be a question.
You don't do that. Yeah. So I was like,

921
01:00:14,261 --> 01:00:17,220
why am I questioning it?
And it finally came to light.

922
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:20,050
I don't think I believe in God.
I don't think it's in me.

923
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,800
And then once I figured that out,
I was like, I think I should stop.

924
01:00:23,801 --> 01:00:28,210
And I went to Taco Bell. You turn that
light off, Huh? Where were you at?

925
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:32,920
A university in New York and like a
Spanish Harlem one 85th and Amsterdam.

926
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:35,990
You went to Taco Bell?
I want to talk about I barfed.

927
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:38,413
Yeah.

928
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:44,120
What did you order? What was the
onpro 20 Tacos for fucking $1 off,

929
01:00:44,121 --> 01:00:47,310
whatever it is. I don't know if it
was because of shitty food or dealt.

930
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:51,990
I'm not really sure. We've been such big
fans of Neil Hamburger. Look that up.

931
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:56,020
I'll pull it up right now. Neil
hamburgers because he started to change.

932
01:00:57,010 --> 01:01:01,600
No, the comment, you know him
right? Uh, hold on. It's so funny.

933
01:01:01,601 --> 01:01:03,640
His Twitter feed is great.
Oh really?

934
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:08,920
He does this semi-regularly where
I want to talk about this brown.

935
01:01:09,251 --> 01:01:13,810
I had no let's not,
let's not lose track of his uh,

936
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:15,740
his story here either.
But yeah

937
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:19,480
you just mentioned this. Did you get so
much stuff going on and got to like, yeah.

938
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:25,890
So he finds people's tweets about getting
sick from Taco Bell and research and

939
01:01:28,121 --> 01:01:32,720
there's a lot of them. Oh my God. So
like go ahead and read it out loud.

940
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,970
I want to talk, I want to talk
about the last time I had it,

941
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:39,430
I almost thought the Taco Bell I work
at got mice and bugs all over this,

942
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:44,350
their place, this sick fuck a Nigga got
food poisoning from tuck about cause

943
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:49,720
I don't know if that meant
because or cousin I was for sure.

944
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:53,230
I did a presentation today on back on
the bacteria that cause food poisoning.

945
01:01:53,231 --> 01:01:55,660
I think I got food poisoning from
talking about ironic as fuck.

946
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:58,890
Talk about getting to cover,
talking about,

947
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,920
talking about for the food poisoning.
The day after graduation,

948
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,340
my boyfriend and I never had
a wheel is Burt taco bell.

949
01:02:06,341 --> 01:02:08,380
This rope food endless,

950
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:17,310
and he does this every few months.
Wow.

951
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:21,150
One day day.
It wasn't like isolated over three years.

952
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:26,010
I found a roach in my food. Never
went back there. Also wrote Shit.

953
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:32,000
I'm mad at Taco Bell. I'm a cart.
Had a whole fat ass ratchet,

954
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:32,843
chill in the lobby.

955
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:41,880
So the Taco bell diarrhea thing is true
about here's what golf go a little Taco

956
01:02:41,881 --> 01:02:44,180
bell three years ago.
Went to Los Lunas domestic.

957
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:46,560
We'll talk about founder here in our food.
Went back today,

958
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:50,390
founder here on our food.
That's for me twice. Yeah.

959
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:56,160
My friend got to talk about it and went
to the hospital when again the next day

960
01:02:56,161 --> 01:03:00,600
and got food boy. He's like, I can't
believe it. I can't believe it. Yeah.

961
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,540
Taco bell never fails to
give me food poisoning.

962
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:07,440
Your nasty ass food establishment
gave me food poisoning. Taco Bell.

963
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:11,180
Never again food. The words food
poisoning I'm talking about.

964
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:13,020
I think you just has to search.

965
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:18,290
Let's talk about that book comes
up. No. Yeah. Food poisoning.

966
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:23,090
Three different times.
I done when I,

967
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:27,940
so I wanted to talk about today in Mount
Vernon and I'd done God pours like or

968
01:03:27,941 --> 01:03:32,830
some shit like God bro, really
be shitting. I am crazy.

969
01:03:32,831 --> 01:03:33,940
Sean Fan Account.

970
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:38,310
Oh Fan. I that was her. I almost
my heart but isn't in the uh,

971
01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:43,330
the amount of them astounding like
this many people. This is countless.

972
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,960
Well, you know, the meat
is supposedly supposedly,

973
01:03:46,961 --> 01:03:50,020
supposedly worse than prison.
This blessed one here

974
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:55,900
and Taco bell are good. That shit
has a Nigga suit. Well accessed.

975
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:59,420
I don't care for your choice of words,
but uh, central med I can come up like,

976
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:04,240
oh damn, that's great. Yeah, I
love what are good cops like that?

977
01:04:04,241 --> 01:04:08,080
Just senators on top. Like you ever see
Colin Quinn's like a tongue in cheek?

978
01:04:08,081 --> 01:04:10,240
Like, oh, we're conservative tweets.

979
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:14,690
Yeah. That's so funny. Oh, his Twitter
account. It never lets it and I'm joking.

980
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:18,410
Never know that would be
like, yeah. And it's partly,

981
01:04:18,411 --> 01:04:22,550
you have to like really,
except that, that,

982
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:25,280
that there's gonna be people out there
that believe that you're serious.

983
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:28,640
And I think that's a real
struggle for like a lot of comics.

984
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:30,770
But I think that he is so

985
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:35,840
that he fully goes for it. Also,
if you don't fool a few people,

986
01:04:35,841 --> 01:04:37,190
it's just not quite as fun.
Exactly.

987
01:04:37,191 --> 01:04:40,190
Any Kaufman how to get people to like
get the fuck off stage or it'd be like,

988
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,260
I like his spirit,
his stuff.

989
01:04:42,261 --> 01:04:47,261
Like there's just nothing like hearing
laughter out there healing the healing

990
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:51,530
power of laughter like Collin tweets,
that kind of shit.

991
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:55,040
Yeah.
That's a smart move.

992
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:59,750
Done that with Rogan instead of
covering them up. I don't know.

993
01:04:59,751 --> 01:05:02,660
I think that that might be true. I
don't think it's made for that. Exactly.

994
01:05:02,661 --> 01:05:05,120
Your mom's stomach for those.
Hey Dude, what are you doing?

995
01:05:05,121 --> 01:05:07,310
I'm sorry your mom has made for
holding up my mark. Stern. Thanks.

996
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:11,300
Glad you're here because you and I,

997
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:16,420
we share a common bond that
we both love to shit and yeah,

998
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:21,610
every time I mentioned it people
like, Oh Christina. I'm like, Oh yeah.

999
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:24,730
I guess we do have our
kindred poos barely on. Yeah,

1000
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:29,800
we got this big day toilets.
The US who goes straight to the shower.

1001
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:33,310
You saved money on toilet paper
first of all, beside the point,

1002
01:05:33,311 --> 01:05:36,820
but is it that flip thing?
Yeah. Uh, second of all,
it's the clinic you can get.

1003
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:40,570
It's the cleanest. No drawing. No John.
Now what mud you to shit to shower.

1004
01:05:40,571 --> 01:05:42,630
I want to talk about
your experience with it.

1005
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:46,590
I believe the first time was kind of like
my epiphany with Judaism where it was

1006
01:05:46,591 --> 01:05:51,130
just like, it just sort of happens. You
know? I was had no toilet paper. Oh,

1007
01:05:51,131 --> 01:05:54,190
I looked under the sink.
Oh I think I did. Yeah.

1008
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:56,950
I think it was in my old place on sunset
and I looked into this thing and I was

1009
01:05:56,951 --> 01:05:58,930
like, no. I'm like fuck,
what am I going to do? Huh?

1010
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:02,890
And then it hit me straight to shower
straight down. That's interesting.

1011
01:06:02,891 --> 01:06:06,640
Cause it necessity is the mother
of invention. It is now with me.

1012
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:10,080
It was that I have what is
known as the never ending wipe.

1013
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:14,830
I get leaky button where I wiped by wiped
by wipe and the paper's always brown

1014
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:20,100
and I found that the only way to stop
the breach is if I shower my butthole.

1015
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:24,880
Yeah. Then the brown stops
coming down. You get like greasy,

1016
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:29,500
Greasy League rec league. It's just
solid brown. No, no. It's like a mush.

1017
01:06:29,501 --> 01:06:33,100
Just like a, like a s schmear.
Oh yeah. Like I don't know.

1018
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:38,570
I don't know what that is. Like a
sun dried tomato cream cheese. Yeah.

1019
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:44,860
Small. But anyway, we got this new toilet,

1020
01:06:44,861 --> 01:06:47,830
this robot toilet that, those
are great. It's a wash led.

1021
01:06:47,831 --> 01:06:51,280
It's a big day in your toilet and
you don't have to go into the shower

1022
01:06:51,281 --> 01:06:53,060
physically. Right. Cause some of
that's annoying. Like I don't want to

1023
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:56,480
my pants off. Take a towel to dry
off this thing though. This thing,

1024
01:06:56,481 --> 01:07:00,770
what's amazing is you have different
water pressure options. Oh,

1025
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:05,510
oscillating pulsating options. What do
you mean water temperature options? Yeah.

1026
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:10,250
Cold, warm, hot. Yup. It's pretty
amazing. So basically you can,

1027
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:13,910
you're done. Yeah. You can have
a nice stream to kind of start.

1028
01:07:13,911 --> 01:07:15,800
Kind of get your ass holiday it.
Yeah.

1029
01:07:16,010 --> 01:07:20,840
And then you can fucking gas it
up and have a fire hose and wow.

1030
01:07:20,841 --> 01:07:23,130
And really get,
get it gone away that you couldn't be,

1031
01:07:23,131 --> 01:07:26,840
you can let that thing run for a minute.
Put toilet paper back there.

1032
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:30,260
Nothing going clean as a west side.
And there's a drier cat. Barilla.

1033
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,210
Explain this to me once about wet,
wet, wipe it as opposed to dry wine.

1034
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:36,860
You know what though? I find, what have
he said? I don't think that's enough.

1035
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:41,460
We'll just in general using water. Water's
great. Yeah. He said he's, I was like, no,

1036
01:07:41,461 --> 01:07:43,800
I just use it was back
then. And he goes, oh no,

1037
01:07:43,801 --> 01:07:46,430
you can actually do the
toilet paper. Yeah. And he was
like, look, and he took some,

1038
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:50,180
a little bit of Coca Cola. Yeah. Put
It on my table. And then he goes, okay,

1039
01:07:50,181 --> 01:07:53,570
let that sit for a minute now wipe it
up with a dry towel and that feel the

1040
01:07:53,571 --> 01:07:56,540
table. I'm like, yeah, a little sticky
goes. Yeah, a little sticky. Yeah.

1041
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:00,910
Get some water. I didn't know
that he was such an expert that

1042
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:06,770
questions for rem. So fascinating. So
I'll tell you about Southeast Asia toilet.

1043
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:09,890
Oh, I can't. Okay, wait, wait. Hold on.
I'll save it. Save it. Okay. Wait, wait.

1044
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:12,840
I've been dying to talk to
you about this. Okay. Yeah.

1045
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:16,340
So now when you do shit
to shower in your world,

1046
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:21,340
do you do a cursory wipe and exploratory
wipe or you literally dump your shit

1047
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:24,410
straight to shower without
even a cursory wipe?

1048
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:26,930
Okay. I'm going to ask you, you have
your opinion later. What do you do?

1049
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:31,090
Occasionally I'll go.
Nothing but cause doesn't really.

1050
01:08:31,091 --> 01:08:33,580
I'll do it constantly wipe because
it's like, what if you trip on the way?

1051
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:35,500
It depends if I have a bathmat.
There you have it.

1052
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,290
I don't want to ruin a bathmat full dump.
Fulled up.

1053
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,210
Just stand up and go in the shower.

1054
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:45,130
Well I can reach over from the tour that
I turned the hot water on other places

1055
01:08:45,131 --> 01:08:47,260
a little harder. Um, but yeah,

1056
01:08:47,261 --> 01:08:50,890
just go full and then we get to
watch all the shit rundown. The sick.

1057
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:54,110
I can psycho. Remember in psycho,
which is bleeding out and the drain,

1058
01:08:54,150 --> 01:08:57,730
the drain blood, you get that
you guys have run down your leg,

1059
01:08:57,731 --> 01:08:59,830
which is usually horrible,
but it's not going to stick.

1060
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:03,380
Right? It's your shower. What
do you do? Okay. Now because

1061
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:08,180
he's a little bolt,
it's on all the time thing for me.

1062
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:10,980
And I do live with someone
so I try to be considered,

1063
01:09:10,981 --> 01:09:13,440
I wouldn't put Dukie he's
not in the bathroom. Yeah.

1064
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:16,710
But he's going to shower there after
me and I don't want shit in our shower

1065
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:20,940
necessarily. Right. So I do an
exploratory consideration. Why have now?

1066
01:09:20,941 --> 01:09:25,200
Sometimes I have just known. I'm like,
that wasn't a massive brown. There's not,

1067
01:09:25,230 --> 01:09:28,260
there's nothing on my asshole
that was a clean break. It's fine.

1068
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:33,200
All right.
We kind of stay here for this,

1069
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:39,020
uh, this noise. This is like the tickets,

1070
01:09:39,021 --> 01:09:43,640
tickets as a journalist writing
stories about, I was like seven feet,

1071
01:09:44,730 --> 01:09:46,260
but um,
yeah,

1072
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:50,040
I'll only do it if I'm confident that
there's no brown on my butt hole.

1073
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:54,510
I will just go straight to shower if I'm
confident and, and sometimes I am. Okay.

1074
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:58,320
You have a bleed out of my vagina. Yeah.
Oh, right, right. It's different. Yeah.

1075
01:09:58,350 --> 01:10:01,380
That's normal. Yeah. Do you, are you
still bleeding out of your asshole?

1076
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,210
Not Through my whole
chip in Southeast Asia.

1077
01:10:03,211 --> 01:10:07,640
And when I got back the second day was
full blood ago. No strippers. Really.

1078
01:10:07,641 --> 01:10:10,020
He's talking about this.
What do you think? Wow.

1079
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:13,710
Do you think that is an
internal hemorrhoid? I've
asked the doctor. He was like,

1080
01:10:13,711 --> 01:10:16,410
you're good at that. Blood's too
dark. Do you see any of this in Asia

1081
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,860
so far? Yes. Flute. I
don't know what she was.

1082
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:26,510
Was putting your list the
way you play flute? I know
who the other people, oh, oh,

1083
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:30,760
holy shit.
Oh,

1084
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:35,420
she's putting other two
seem shocked or animate.

1085
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:41,280
Wow. Flute with her VGM guys. You do that.

1086
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:44,790
Could you push out air that way? No,
I've never been able to Queef on command.

1087
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:48,460
Now he's loving it. She's like, what the,

1088
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:52,680
that's a real talent though.
She's also playing a tune.

1089
01:10:52,681 --> 01:10:55,560
She's not just blowing out anyways. Also
hitting the keep. That's right. Yeah.

1090
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:57,720
It's a real skill.
Anything like that you see in your job.

1091
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,700
Last time I went to Thailand
like two years ago, what's a, uh,

1092
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:06,900
a pop harm the street in
Thailand at a women? These women,

1093
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:11,070
is that Bangkok, Bangkok. They
gave you a rolled up piece of, uh,

1094
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:15,510
well first they give a balloon, like hold
it above your head and you're like, why?

1095
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:20,190
Boy? And then they shoot darts out of
the vaginas and pop your balloon. Wow.

1096
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:24,720
Then you applaud for that. I assume it's
not sexual at all. It's just talents.

1097
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,230
Then you roll up a piece of paper into
a funnel, hold that over your head like,

1098
01:11:29,231 --> 01:11:32,280
what are you doing? And then they start
peeling bananas and you're like, no.

1099
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:34,950
And then they ship it out and get
it into the Little Cup you've made.

1100
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:38,940
What's the trick? What's the, there's,
there's gotta be a circus trick.

1101
01:11:38,941 --> 01:11:41,790
Their practice,
they get to Carnegie Hall.

1102
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:47,090
That can't be legit. No Way, man. That

1103
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:53,430
I've seen, they put it in there, pops out.

1104
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:57,990
Wow. I don't have a
vagina. I don't know. Wow.

1105
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:01,290
Got to be able to suck air in
before you put the object in.

1106
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:03,420
Because I've seen girls
that can queef on command.

1107
01:12:03,421 --> 01:12:06,930
I've had friends that can do it and you
lay on your back and you suck in the air.

1108
01:12:06,931 --> 01:12:11,730
I had a roommate that did
that with his asshole. No, no,

1109
01:12:11,731 --> 01:12:15,510
no, just the air thing. But like
right on, like he would just get on,

1110
01:12:15,511 --> 01:12:20,130
he could do it on all fours or lay
on his back and just all day he'd go.

1111
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:25,980
Really? Yeah. Wow. What a
superhero. It was really cool.

1112
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:29,430
Yeah. I wonder if they have like
a wrestling style school for that,

1113
01:12:29,431 --> 01:12:31,710
for shooting stuff out of your vagina
where it's like you're not ready yet,

1114
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:36,690
but I want to get my accreditation. Let's
talk about the toilets in Asia. Okay,

1115
01:12:36,691 --> 01:12:40,970
so they have these, if they're not squat
toilets, I hate those. They're pretty bad.

1116
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:42,420
I hear that it's better for you.

1117
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:51,450
I love how much removed ourselves
from people actually hiring us.

1118
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:59,390
No apology necessary to look
somebody.

1119
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:02,160
It's an Asian person saying it so

1120
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:09,660
it's not an impression. Yeah, there's
just giving out directions. Who knows?

1121
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:15,210
So they have the squatters,
they had the squad,

1122
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:17,940
but a lot of times will they have
toilets in hostels and stuff.

1123
01:13:17,941 --> 01:13:20,670
They have toilets, but they have
these bum guns, which is just like,

1124
01:13:20,671 --> 01:13:23,190
you know how I want to sync, you'll
get like the thing you get to pull out.

1125
01:13:23,210 --> 01:13:27,480
And as a host, but without the,
uh, the, um, what's it called?

1126
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:28,343
The spray.

1127
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:33,030
So it's just a street and you put that
into your butt or towards your butt and

1128
01:13:33,031 --> 01:13:34,560
you just spray it out.
And then like you said,

1129
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:37,470
you've got that one wipe and it's
almost clean. Did you like that?

1130
01:13:37,471 --> 01:13:41,550
Did you prefer that to your LLC? Yeah,
you can't throw out. I got used to it.

1131
01:13:41,551 --> 01:13:44,610
No Shit shouts the best. But you can't
throw out your toilet paper in the toilet.

1132
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:48,210
Right? Cause they all still up.
Throw in the trashcan. Fal is shit.

1133
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:49,950
It smells horrible.

1134
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:55,750
So one of my good friends is married to
a woman from Mexico and when her family

1135
01:13:59,311 --> 01:14:02,880
came, they would throw stuff out
in the Trashcan, toilet paper like,

1136
01:14:02,881 --> 01:14:05,970
but like I love it. Used
toilet paper, toilet paper,

1137
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:08,150
and you guys don't have a
bum gone. So like, aw yeah.

1138
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:12,970
So there's this big wads of shit.
Not like they're getting one last white,

1139
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,490
they're doing the whole thing in there.
And he was like,

1140
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:18,700
you gotta stop doing this.
And they just so habitual,

1141
01:14:18,701 --> 01:14:22,700
we're talking like their 40 years
of doing this. So they put some,

1142
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:27,010
he had a type signs you put flushing.
Yeah, that's, that's the, uh,

1143
01:14:27,011 --> 01:14:29,110
the opposite of that in those
hostile where it's like, Hey,

1144
01:14:29,111 --> 01:14:33,470
I know you used to where you are. You
can't flush toilet over here. Uh Oh, hey,

1145
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,920
I had a question. Oh Hey,
we had an email today.

1146
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:39,310
How do blind people know
when to stop wiping?

1147
01:14:39,311 --> 01:14:41,290
What are your thoughts on that test?

1148
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:45,400
And their sense of taste
is higher than most people

1149
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:51,550
thought it was a thing where
they eventually do a bare
hand thing and then they

1150
01:14:51,551 --> 01:14:54,460
just go, oh, there's nothing
there. But they'd have to like,

1151
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:57,400
they couldn't go like half of that. I
want to how close I am. Right, right.

1152
01:14:57,430 --> 01:15:00,670
Like you look at toilet paper when
you're out, when you don't have a shower,

1153
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,430
you look at it, you're like,
okay, I'm about halfway there.

1154
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,810
You look at it three quarters of
the way there. Yeah, that's true.

1155
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,720
You don't just keep going until it like,
this feels dry. Oh, I've been way done.

1156
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:10,120
Right, right, right. Maybe
you smell the toilet paper.

1157
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:13,690
Why do you have to smell your bare
hand? Oh, that's a great tweak.

1158
01:15:13,691 --> 01:15:16,660
What you just did right? He just stepped
it up a great, wait, what are you saying?

1159
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:20,000
Because I'm an observational
person. Why? Why are you,

1160
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:22,180
why do they have to smell their bare hand?
Like you said,

1161
01:15:22,181 --> 01:15:24,970
why not smell the toilet paper?
Oh, I see what that's like

1162
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:31,570
because one of them told me this what they
do really well. So I got this for you.

1163
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:37,570
Park with a Ryan O'Neal and uh,
I mean 10 middleware,

1164
01:15:37,890 --> 01:15:41,680
Griffith Park, just walking
around. Okay. And uh,

1165
01:15:42,130 --> 01:15:46,320
10 minutes in I was like, I didn't shut
this morning and I have to shit. Ooh.

1166
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:50,320
He's like, really? I'm like, no, I'll
hold it, hold it three more minutes.

1167
01:15:50,321 --> 01:15:53,580
Like I'm not holding it, man. I got to go.
He was like, how are you going to wipe?

1168
01:15:53,581 --> 01:15:58,240
And I'm like, well, he had a full bottle
of water. I'm like, put that. He was like,

1169
01:15:58,241 --> 01:16:02,730
what do you, what? What do
you mean no, don't do this?
And I was like, yeah, I have.

1170
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:04,090
Did it have the sports top?

1171
01:16:06,690 --> 01:16:09,840
Just kind of like one of these
arrowhead bottle and then, uh,

1172
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:12,970
I shit on a hill so it really squat shot,

1173
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:15,100
which I'm used to now I've got experience.

1174
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:18,660
You get away from people got out and went
down the hill a little bit, cut to it.

1175
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:20,110
Got to like a big Bush behind me.

1176
01:16:20,111 --> 01:16:22,560
So people that were on the road
on the path that I could see.

1177
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:25,670
If you were way down and you looked up,
you could for sure see a man squatters.

1178
01:16:26,870 --> 01:16:28,420
They thought it was homeless.
I didn't have my shirt on

1179
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:34,690
the squatting technique because I imagine
what's problematic is that you might

1180
01:16:34,691 --> 01:16:38,200
shit on your jeans. Absolutely.
You learned to lean backwards.

1181
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:41,020
There's also a pull your
jeans forward. Let me, uh,

1182
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:48,340
let the legs. Yeah, hold
on. Um, I I want to watch,

1183
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:54,050
I don't need to see that.
You pretty much get the idea from,

1184
01:16:54,090 --> 01:16:55,150
you want to go around the corner there.

1185
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:02,260
He's got his pants down right now.

1186
01:17:02,261 --> 01:17:07,261
He's got some mushroom boxer
shorts and he's standing and show,

1187
01:17:12,070 --> 01:17:14,780
sorry. Pulled his pants
down to his underwear. Dan,

1188
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:17,720
please put them back on for the lab.
We have dogs in here.

1189
01:17:19,290 --> 01:17:23,580
He's showing,
please don't pull your pants down.

1190
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:29,810
Squatting right into the pan. He's
squatting, but you're squatting straight.

1191
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:33,350
So everything's at a perfect angle.
Yes. Okay, so you're hanging,

1192
01:17:33,970 --> 01:17:36,520
your pants are now above.
Okay, so you're really,

1193
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:39,590
the key is that you really
squat back a little bit.

1194
01:17:41,050 --> 01:17:45,160
You squat full shots, right, Tom? Oh God.

1195
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:49,380
The touching the toilet is a real
issue. I have big long balls. Yeah.

1196
01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:54,260
So that's an issue. But I was on a hill
and Griffith Park. No big deal right now.

1197
01:17:54,261 --> 01:17:55,700
When you were doing that at Griffith Park,

1198
01:17:55,701 --> 01:17:58,580
what about the weeds and the brush
touching your dick and your balls and your

1199
01:17:58,581 --> 01:18:01,510
butthole and all that?
Some dried leaves definitely touched it.

1200
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:04,900
Didn't care for it.
So you're saying it's all about the lean,

1201
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:08,570
like what you kind of did the way you
were squatting is how I've seen like

1202
01:18:08,571 --> 01:18:11,540
Chinese guys smoking in Chinatown.
Yeah, they're used to it.

1203
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:13,930
They always sit like that. Yeah. The slot,

1204
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:18,950
the Stud fullback squats up with Dan.
Your balls are so big,

1205
01:18:18,951 --> 01:18:21,000
so big. So then I poured
water on my, my hands

1206
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:24,540
immediately as it's wet, took it to the
butt and kind of wiped. Oh you take,

1207
01:18:24,541 --> 01:18:28,470
you did it with your hands and then it
got more water. Wipe more water wife? No,

1208
01:18:28,471 --> 01:18:29,520
didn't dig in with nails,

1209
01:18:29,550 --> 01:18:33,990
didn't want to stick my nails and then
I was forced by Ryan to wipe my hands in

1210
01:18:33,991 --> 01:18:37,280
dirt afterwards. Yeah. And then you
wash your hands later. I'm hoping. Yeah.

1211
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:37,741
How much?

1212
01:18:37,741 --> 01:18:40,260
Like do you get a lot of ball attention
when you're with like are they like,

1213
01:18:40,290 --> 01:18:44,610
oh he's a great ball of like the big
thing with a couple of times. Yeah.

1214
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:47,520
I've had a couple girls go like,
man I love these balls really?

1215
01:18:47,550 --> 01:18:51,420
But like twice now. Are you really into
your own balls then? Like is that a big,

1216
01:18:51,450 --> 01:18:55,560
like if you were making your list where
you're like definitely like play with my

1217
01:18:55,561 --> 01:18:59,790
balls. I think. Comedically they're good
weapons. Yeah. How saggy they are. Yeah.

1218
01:18:59,970 --> 01:19:03,830
I mean if there were a nice tight
ones it wouldn't be as funny as it is.

1219
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:07,630
It really a turn. I'm saying like if, if
you were like, if a woman was like, what,

1220
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:09,480
what do you like what we're about
to have sex? Where you'd be like,

1221
01:19:09,481 --> 01:19:11,070
definitely play with my balls.
Okay.

1222
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:13,470
So it's not like your thing
I'm saying I don't mind it.

1223
01:19:13,471 --> 01:19:16,020
It's kind of Nice actually,
but it's not like I need that.

1224
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:19,470
It's not like you need it.
You, I mean, I like it,

1225
01:19:19,471 --> 01:19:22,130
but I mean it's not like I wouldn't be
like, if you don't tell on my balls,

1226
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:26,430
we had a problem. How big
were Ari's balls? They just,

1227
01:19:26,730 --> 01:19:31,000
why not looking at all was like six balls.
The left one has a lot lower.

1228
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:35,760
Like a, it looked like a half
mad pizza dough kind of thing.

1229
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:39,420
There was just like,
it didn't look too hairy.

1230
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:42,660
Got a glimpse.
Kind of like a teenager's beard.

1231
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,370
Just an occasional in who there
you do a lot of trimming or no,

1232
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:51,770
nothing really zip. I got
to do a lot of that. Really?

1233
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:58,260
No, no. What are you half
Peruvian, Peruvian and I, you know,

1234
01:19:58,590 --> 01:20:02,880
whatever. But um, it's a lot.
I don't know. It's a lot of
hair. I don't, I'm not like,

1235
01:20:02,910 --> 01:20:07,040
oh, actually I have one of my friends
who like him fall down. They're not bald.

1236
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:08,700
I like a good cleanup.

1237
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:12,540
I think that it's important to
at least be a little hygienic.

1238
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:16,420
I don't like so much hair that
it's annoying. It too much. Yeah.

1239
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:21,180
It can get away from you stop storing
at some point though. Yeah, it does,

1240
01:20:21,181 --> 01:20:23,340
but sometimes I look down
there, I'm like, oof. Yeah.

1241
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:28,050
I mean I just need like a
haircut. You don't want to
Tuft. Yeah, no, that's gross.

1242
01:20:28,051 --> 01:20:30,180
And then it's two velcro
way when it's too long.

1243
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:33,090
Sometimes it looks like the hedge, just
like peeking out of the woods. You know?

1244
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:36,650
Like my Dick just heard something like,
what's going on?

1245
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:43,160
Like groundhog's Day,
a few weeks of winter back in polyps.

1246
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:47,850
Is that what you have polyps? Is that
in your butt hole? You said you have

1247
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:54,750
and can you do something to
stop them from Bono? He said,

1248
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:58,260
I could have surgeries is not worth
it. He's like, it might not work.

1249
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:02,220
And it's just like invasive and you've
never, have you ever seen Jew clam,

1250
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:07,170
excuse me? Or He's going
to show or not right now.

1251
01:21:07,171 --> 01:21:11,970
I can't do it. It doesn't sound really,
it's so bad. I saw it in person.

1252
01:21:11,971 --> 01:21:16,560
I was like, dude, I was in a
capsule. I wasn't kept city.

1253
01:21:16,630 --> 01:21:19,930
Yeah. Re we put that video
out to promote my special.

1254
01:21:20,530 --> 01:21:23,710
I saw it and I remember that I pulled,
uh,

1255
01:21:24,030 --> 01:21:27,620
I was so traumatized that I
pulled Brian aside was like,

1256
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:31,410
he need to go to the hospital.
I'd never seen anything like that.

1257
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:32,850
I know it's crazy

1258
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:36,830
and that isn't a problem.

1259
01:21:36,831 --> 01:21:40,190
Like that shouldn't be surge or whatever.

1260
01:21:41,570 --> 01:21:46,500
Is it just that you bleed a lot? It's
like, I mean he really got to see it.

1261
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:52,030
It's like we already have to
blur one puffed up facade.
Yeah. It's so crazy. Like

1262
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:57,150
his basically his,
you ever seen like a chimps ass?

1263
01:21:57,370 --> 01:22:02,070
How it's like bubbles.
It's like all big and yes.

1264
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:06,020
Yes. That happens. Vagina.

1265
01:22:06,210 --> 01:22:11,210
That happened to him on camera and I
saw him turning and when I saw it I was

1266
01:22:11,281 --> 01:22:14,940
like, I literally, I had
never seen anything like this.

1267
01:22:14,941 --> 01:22:19,941
I saw this swollen sticking out
of him like peach bread asshole.

1268
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:27,780
And it, it looked like it looked like
it wasn't like your real asshole.

1269
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:30,390
I been trying to push out a shit
for like the last like three,

1270
01:22:30,391 --> 01:22:33,480
four straight minutes and I
thought that's what it was.

1271
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:36,210
That shit was halfway out of my book.
So I was trying to show you,

1272
01:22:36,270 --> 01:22:38,640
you saw it like, cause you knew
what that was, what it looked like.

1273
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:41,970
I thought there was a piece of shit
coming out of my butt and I was trying to

1274
01:22:41,971 --> 01:22:45,810
show you that be the most disgusting
me when you saw it on yourself,

1275
01:22:45,811 --> 01:22:50,370
weren't you a little like, oh my God.
Like okay. Yeah. Like it's a little scary,

1276
01:22:50,371 --> 01:22:52,740
right? It's a little scary
to see. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1277
01:22:52,741 --> 01:22:56,140
But it was like I can search stuff has
been there for awhile, but that's that,

1278
01:22:56,250 --> 01:23:01,010
that didn't feel good to wipe it spine.
It's pretty tough.

1279
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:04,270
And then it just kind of goes
back in. It goes back hand. Yeah.

1280
01:23:05,570 --> 01:23:06,190
All right.

1281
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:10,750
I mean we've already said wow, is it
when just got to the one not on Youtube,

1282
01:23:10,751 --> 01:23:14,880
I think like live leak or something.
Okay. Uncensored on censored Juke. Clam.

1283
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:20,050
But still, it's still like
that, Ari? Yeah. I can show
you right now. No, no, no.

1284
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:26,230
That's okay. Bubby. Yeah.
That's a terrible thing to live.

1285
01:23:26,990 --> 01:23:30,690
Bleached out. Punch drunk.
Ah, I saw that on the, uh,

1286
01:23:30,691 --> 01:23:34,990
I saw that Sam triple e's. How'd that
go? Did it hurt? No, a little warm.

1287
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:37,710
A little little heat on it. But, uh,

1288
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,300
you get to see it before and after shot,
like,

1289
01:23:40,301 --> 01:23:42,810
so you could see I've seen it before
or after. It just seemed like the,

1290
01:23:42,890 --> 01:23:44,710
the parts that he didn't bleed,
we're just darker.

1291
01:23:44,990 --> 01:23:47,830
Didn't look like it was lighter. That's
so funny that people are doing that.

1292
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:50,560
Is that real? I mean, if you're a
porn star, I get it. But otherwise,

1293
01:23:50,770 --> 01:23:53,680
in civilian life, why would you
need to have your ass hole? I mean,

1294
01:23:53,681 --> 01:23:56,890
once we got into an accident and you
badly burned inside your asshole,

1295
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:03,070
it's aesthetics, guys down. I'm just like,

1296
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:07,990
I'm trying to play it and yeah,
but it just says, you know,

1297
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:11,400
so I go, hit play. I'm hitting play
right now. It's all on video cuts.

1298
01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:15,830
It's horrific news today. Must be
over there. Just won't play. Uh,

1299
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:20,380
I wonder if this other one will
play. Oh, here's a reddit link to it.

1300
01:24:20,470 --> 01:24:23,020
Maybe this will play.
This is fun.

1301
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:29,630
It's our pizza dish. I'm
thinking of getting one of
those big day. Thanks dude. Uh,

1302
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:32,230
Amazon, you don't have to, she don't
have to like get in the shower.

1303
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,220
Did I haven't shit to shower.
I only do it in hotels now.

1304
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:40,210
Cause there was the well yeah they
don't now I feel like a diminished,

1305
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:43,690
degraded human when I have to shit on
a toilet that doesn't have a bad day.

1306
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:47,860
I feel like it's, I feel like trash to
use to it. It's going to change your life.

1307
01:24:47,861 --> 01:24:51,580
It's called the toto washlet three 50.
He washlet wash.

1308
01:24:51,581 --> 01:24:56,010
Let washlet I dunno, do why
he's saying it like that. Is it,

1309
01:24:56,720 --> 01:25:00,790
is it wash let or Washlet washlet Oh,

1310
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:04,710
I thought it was French.
Maybe like two t's and an e and Lit.

1311
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:12,090
Fucking know. But uh, it'll really
change your whole shit game. Yeah,

1312
01:25:12,091 --> 01:25:15,110
I might do that. See if you have blood
and stuff down there, you should work.

1313
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:19,930
So now when you do that,
then does a stop with a continuous wiping?

1314
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:24,580
Yeah, it's good. Cleans it up. Wow. The
water is what I need to stop the leaky,

1315
01:25:24,581 --> 01:25:28,480
but wow. I don't know why my butt leaks.
Have you ever before you got that,

1316
01:25:28,510 --> 01:25:32,680
did you ever wipe say, okay, I think I'm
good. Then go out and go, oh, I think I'm,

1317
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:35,980
I think I've got to go back to wipe.
That's how I've discovered my leaky,

1318
01:25:35,981 --> 01:25:40,300
but probably, yeah. And then
like hours later I'll be like,

1319
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:44,320
oh my God, why is there Brown there?
These, these summer days by the way,

1320
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:49,690
summer. Oh Harry. You know like
sometimes I'll be like, ah,

1321
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:55,340
and I'll just go sit down with paper
to see if there's something there.

1322
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:59,650
And you just see so much brands. It's
just like sweat and your, your food.

1323
01:25:59,651 --> 01:26:04,040
If you walk around New York City, it's
the same way. Wait, are you going back to

1324
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:10,220

1326
01:26:12,111 --> 01:26:13,730
I'm going to be there like a
couple of weeks just hanging out.

1327
01:26:13,731 --> 01:26:17,930
If you want to come back. You really
good. I'm just gonna stay. Definitely. No.

1328
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:22,410

thousand of times because he's overly

1354
01:28:08,781 --> 01:28:12,440
jealous.
She's real a thousand of times.

1355
01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:15,260
He basically is least with me.

1356
01:28:16,550 --> 01:28:20,720
He doesn't know any thing about me.
Right.

1357
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:26,140
He's in no rush to get to a point.

1364
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:58,650
Would she be upset you had to do on your
podcast? I don't think she'd be a real,

probably at the, she say anything
at they Semitic or, or anything.

Okay.

1384
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:30,380
The shrimp Scampi.

1385
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:32,473

And she sings happy birthday.

1397
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:25,070
Hitler and the submarines.
Right.

1398
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:26,650
I mean it's not out of the realm of like,

1399
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:36,970
no,

1400
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:43,580
I don't know lips.

1401
01:31:48,990 --> 01:31:52,050
Yeah, that'd be birthday.
Yeah. Nigger Lips.

1402
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:57,330
I don't know if she's saying saying stuff.
Shrimp Scampi.

1403
01:31:57,331 --> 01:31:59,620
Boat problems.
Eylea

1404
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:01,030
way.
Okay.

1405
01:32:01,031 --> 01:32:06,031
Actually I get rid of the demons
is to actually say happy Easter.

1406
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:10,730
Bye. Okay. Oh Man. That would've,

1407
01:32:12,890 --> 01:32:15,740
that would've made all those diva
movies way lamer. Yeah. Yeah.

1408
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:18,570
The thing I was looking for.
Do you remember her? Um,

1409
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:22,710
one of her oh gee ones was about,
um,

1410
01:32:23,530 --> 01:32:25,880
shitting in and around.
Yeah.

1411
01:32:26,110 --> 01:32:29,740
I can't find it around and
that's hard to find. Yeah.

1412
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:34,750
We could be looking all day for that. I
know, but she had a great one about, um,

1413
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:39,400
what she was going to do
to, uh, this guy when she,

1414
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:42,670
when she was going to shit in
his mouth and not around it,

1415
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:46,600
but she likes specified where
she was getting. Really?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hit Look,

1416
01:32:46,601 --> 01:32:50,750
you're only get a hard,
if you short on his chest was that,

1417
01:32:51,090 --> 01:32:55,190
you should talk about that. Like he had
a small Dick and that he had a, yeah,

1418
01:32:55,990 --> 01:32:58,870
that's what I always heard when I
was growing or latent. Homosexual.

1419
01:32:58,871 --> 01:33:01,120
And how was growing up around
people who didn't like Hitler?

1420
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:05,170
Why you wear the most problem?
I think, uh, they were just, uh,

1421
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:09,200
not fans of the EU. Yeah. I think that's
what he was trying to unite. Yeah. Yeah.

1422
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:13,210
Sorry. We should do, would you rather
with Arie, what'd you rather? Yeah,

1423
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:17,320
like the historical one, the big one.
Oh, okay. Well there's a couple I got.

1424
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,930
I just think it'd be fun to
play with them. Yeah, sure.

1425
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:23,770
Would you rather only Lasagna
for the rest of your life? Yeah.

1426
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:28,920
Or never have to never be able
to eat anything with meat?

1427
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:32,840
Nope. One day, one day, one meal a day.

1428
01:33:32,870 --> 01:33:37,070
How do we live off your life or no
meat for the rest of the top layer

1429
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:41,480
that goes and checking or

1430
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:49,470
toilet paper. The urine. Homeless.
There's times by my butt.

1431
01:33:51,620 --> 01:33:53,180
Sex with your sister.

1432
01:33:53,410 --> 01:33:58,410
They the face grandmother
walks on you masturbating,

1433
01:33:59,210 --> 01:34:03,770
never have another orgasm.
China,

1434
01:34:04,130 --> 01:34:05,940
China, China. Would you rather

1435
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:12,530
I want to hear my options again.
It's either Lasagna,

1436
01:34:12,531 --> 01:34:15,500
one meal a day for the rest of
your life. Every day. Every day.

1437
01:34:15,501 --> 01:34:19,820
You must eat lasagna high. Does that meat
and veggies your choice. Your choice.

1438
01:34:19,850 --> 01:34:22,850
Okay. Um, but you can't eat anything else.

1439
01:34:22,851 --> 01:34:25,610
You can have like a little
piece of Lasagna and like
a salad is just as Anya for

1440
01:34:25,611 --> 01:34:28,760
a meal. One meal a day. Yeah. You
have two pieces, three pieces,

1441
01:34:28,790 --> 01:34:32,390
but for the rest of your life you
get other meals. Dinner. Yeah,

1442
01:34:32,391 --> 01:34:34,370
that could just be lunch. Okay. Um,

1443
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:36,490
but you don't get to like have
another thing that you have to eat it,

1444
01:34:36,630 --> 01:34:39,350
it to fill up on it. Okay.
That's a, that's a B,

1445
01:34:39,351 --> 01:34:43,220
the formula or you're a vegetarian but,

1446
01:34:43,230 --> 01:34:47,270
but you're saying no fish as a
vegetarian. Yeah, no fish. So no protein.

1447
01:34:47,271 --> 01:34:51,980
You basically have to be like
a Vu may have eggs. I see.

1448
01:34:51,981 --> 01:34:55,250
I have to have that protein.
I feel, I feel weird when I
don't have protein. Yeah.

1449
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:59,110
I'm going to have to go with the Lasagna
today. Wow. Cause I like Lasagna.

1450
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:00,410
Like I feel like I could do that.

1451
01:35:00,510 --> 01:35:05,090
You don't feel like you'll be betraying
Lasagna by eventually hating it? No.

1452
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:10,180
Okay. No. What? What do you say, Tommy
Jeans? I have to do this right now. Okay.

1453
01:35:10,370 --> 01:35:11,600
Our area.
What do you choose?

1454
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:17,390
I didn't really think of what I said
to love me. Pedal Saga every day.

1455
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:20,600
I know it's tough because you know when
you make a Lasagna you end up eating it

1456
01:35:20,601 --> 01:35:24,560
for three or four days anyway by
day four you're just overestimate.

1457
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:28,820
So what was the other option
besides a Lasagna? Be a vegetarian.

1458
01:35:28,850 --> 01:35:33,290
No fish. You can only have, oof.

1459
01:35:33,530 --> 01:35:36,530
I know. Well I think I'd have
to do lasagna every single day.

1460
01:35:37,300 --> 01:35:39,920
What if you just ate a
tiny square that allowed?

1461
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:49,580
Not Allowed, but here's the
thing. The variety provided
to you in the other meals,

1462
01:35:49,610 --> 01:35:53,510
I think would would counter it. Yeah.
I feel weak when I don't eat meat.

1463
01:35:53,570 --> 01:35:56,930
I like meat.
Did you go to a dinner party?

1464
01:35:56,931 --> 01:36:01,640
Like we got Lasagna to the, yeah.
You would kill someone? Yeah. Wait,

1465
01:36:01,641 --> 01:36:05,090
what would you choose?
I think I'd be a vegetarian.

1466
01:36:06,170 --> 01:36:10,640
I think I would get real sick of Lasagna
and I'd start to go crazy. That's true,

1467
01:36:10,850 --> 01:36:11,441
but what could it,

1468
01:36:11,441 --> 01:36:15,050
could you have different Lasagna is like
with the best Sharm El Sauce one day or

1469
01:36:15,051 --> 01:36:19,010
does it have to be the standard tomato
Warfield pictured it was the same exact

1470
01:36:19,011 --> 01:36:21,860
recipe. Lasagna. Like when you say you
make a thing of Lasagna of keep eating it.

1471
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:24,320
I imagine like a 50 mile long one.

1472
01:36:24,970 --> 01:36:29,320
It's always lasagna fresh or heat it up.
That's the only variety your got.

1473
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:34,800
I put shaky cheese on it one day the
next day. No shaky. I try to vary it.

1474
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,110
I think I would have
to do that just to be,

1475
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:40,910
be able to have whatever I want for
the second and the third meal. I agree.

1476
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:44,240
I agree. Okay. Ready? Oh sorry. Go ahead.

1477
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:48,530
This is probably one of our most
favorite ways you rathers on the show.

1478
01:36:48,531 --> 01:36:49,580
Very popular.

1479
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:55,280
It would you rather be retarded.
Hold on.

1480
01:36:55,510 --> 01:36:59,560
I'll stop you there. I would love to.
I, you're gonna give me another positive

1481
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:03,250
or be a millionaire that I don't know,

1482
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:08,280
but like I would love the
lack of responsibility you
must feel would be so worth

1483
01:37:08,591 --> 01:37:13,050
it. You really need to throw
in the towel. I mean, you know

1484
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:18,650
who's going to do that chore? Well for
sure not me, right? Because I'm retarded,

1485
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:21,820
so for sure it's not me. However,
you guys can decide who's doing it,

1486
01:37:21,821 --> 01:37:24,420
but I'm out of this.
Can I just go pee corner?

1487
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:28,100
Thank you. Have a job like
you have to go. How many jobs?

1488
01:37:28,930 --> 01:37:31,100
I remember that commercial
when you were little.

1489
01:37:34,030 --> 01:37:36,020
Do you remember that? Like,
yeah, we played it on the show.

1490
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:40,820
What you have to go work at the
grocery story and have to bag groceries

1491
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:46,010
pushcarts stuff like that. When you get
a retarded guy back in your groceries,

1492
01:37:46,011 --> 01:37:48,140
does part of you feel like
I'm part of the solution?

1493
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:51,170
I've said this is one of my favorite.

1494
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:56,100
I love doing this to people. I did
this to my mother. We were at a grocery

1495
01:37:56,100 --> 01:38:01,100
store and they had a retarded guy
bagging the groceries and he wa at this

1496
01:38:02,161 --> 01:38:03,870
grocery store.
They walk you to the car too.

1497
01:38:04,230 --> 01:38:07,530
So they walk to the car and they load
it in and so he did, he did all that.

1498
01:38:07,531 --> 01:38:10,860
There's no conversation. And then as
we're getting in the car turn on long ago,

1499
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:13,080
someone was different about that guy.
Right?

1500
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:18,840
He's retarded.

1501
01:38:20,230 --> 01:38:24,720
He also doesn't know like PC
things to say and she's like, I go,

1502
01:38:24,730 --> 01:38:29,490
no. She goes, tell me please. And I go,

1503
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:33,000
he's fine.
But he was like off and he's clearly,

1504
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:39,970
and she's just like, just upset. I do
that also when I see somebody walking,

1505
01:38:40,770 --> 01:38:44,970
like, you know, fuck with her, like with
them, with my parents, I'll be like,

1506
01:38:44,980 --> 01:38:49,680
this guy's drunk still.
And she'll be like,

1507
01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:52,110
but they don't like, they
don't go, they don't get that.

1508
01:38:52,111 --> 01:38:55,320
I'm saying that as a jokes. I do it
seriously. And then there'll be like,

1509
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:59,930
that guy's severely disabled. Like
he's, he's fucked up and they're light.

1510
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:04,310
And I'm like, oh, he's drunk, but
you could sell it. I liked it.

1511
01:39:04,311 --> 01:39:04,981
Then my friend's like,
oh,

1512
01:39:04,981 --> 01:39:09,981
look at this soccer on the 80 year old
man I fucking asshole in to see somebody

1513
01:39:10,021 --> 01:39:13,680
super hot. Like what Tom does is when
he sees a pregnant woman, he'll be like,

1514
01:39:14,130 --> 01:39:18,010
what's wrong with her stomach?
I have a stupid,

1515
01:39:18,011 --> 01:39:21,480
I posted that on Instagram before and
it's almost like that Collin, when thing,

1516
01:39:21,481 --> 01:39:25,560
we were talking about some people
going to be pregnant and I'm like,

1517
01:39:25,590 --> 01:39:29,000
no dude. I post with
Adam West side. I was,

1518
01:39:29,790 --> 01:39:34,140
I had this contract with our fans.
A celebrity dies as soon as possible.

1519
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:37,290
I will shit on him as soon as they died.
As soon as I hear about it,

1520
01:39:37,291 --> 01:39:39,280
I will try to come up with a funny
tweet shitting on them. Yeah.

1521
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:41,760
Not Respecting their death.
Yeah. So for Adam West,

1522
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:44,400
because I didn't really have any problems
at all with Adam West. Yeah. I was like,

1523
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:47,080
um,
Adam with Fox,

1524
01:39:47,090 --> 01:39:50,460
my grandmother tore apart my fat and
my father's family, I saw that. I saw,

1525
01:39:50,461 --> 01:39:53,370
I'll never forgive him. I'm Moshe
Kasher was like, is that real?

1526
01:39:55,050 --> 01:39:56,310
You fucking idiot.

1527
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:01,530
Tore my family apart.

1528
01:40:05,910 --> 01:40:06,810
Sorry sir.

1529
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:12,380
Would you rather be retarded or let your
grandfather jerk you off on a Ferris

1530
01:40:13,171 --> 01:40:16,110
wheel?
But you get,

1531
01:40:16,590 --> 01:40:20,840
you get a funnel cake to
choose the Ferris wheel,

1532
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:28,090
a funnel cake. And all he does
is he does, he drops you off on,

1533
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:31,820
no one finds out and you get an
awesome fresh funnel cake. Go ahead.

1534
01:40:32,660 --> 01:40:36,270
Does a funnel cake come before or after
the jerk off on the first one after.

1535
01:40:36,690 --> 01:40:40,260
So it's like you're done. You're crying.
So it doesn't make you feel better.

1536
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:46,830
This is our thing. Like don't tell
anybody here's a funnel. Yeah.

1537
01:40:47,590 --> 01:40:52,590
Feel like the experience of having the
funnel cake with Papa would be a sort

1538
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:58,510
of tainted from the Turk off it is.
It is by you.

1539
01:40:58,511 --> 01:41:01,240
Here's the thing.
But if I get the final cake before,

1540
01:41:01,241 --> 01:41:04,480
it'd be a nice moment with my,
with my, with my papa or my Saba.

1541
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:09,040
But then afterwards I'd be like nothing
to wash down that bad feeling. Yeah.

1542
01:41:09,041 --> 01:41:13,820
The cyber like a Jew means
grandfather. Okay, Bro. Um,

1543
01:41:14,130 --> 01:41:18,160
it is a tough one. See? Yeah. I
can't imagine my Saba growing.

1544
01:41:18,430 --> 01:41:20,050
I survived the Holocaust for this.

1545
01:41:20,290 --> 01:41:24,190
We'll fill out would you rather
from Christina, but okay. So,

1546
01:41:24,191 --> 01:41:26,050
but you're either
retarded your whole life.

1547
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:29,620
Do one bad incident on the Ferris wheel,
but there's funnel cake.

1548
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:34,830
I approved juice and you got to consider
that you might be get way into it and

1549
01:41:37,231 --> 01:41:39,130
then want to have that
happen over and over again.

1550
01:41:40,170 --> 01:41:43,050
But it's not just a onetime
thing. Sure. I don't,

1551
01:41:43,110 --> 01:41:46,730
I don't jerk off to anime porn for
that reason. Why is that? What a five,

1552
01:41:46,830 --> 01:41:49,270
I don't want to go down
that road. Right. You know,

1553
01:41:49,290 --> 01:41:52,560
and then be like working off the cartoons.
It's too dark or road.

1554
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:54,180
So what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah.

1555
01:41:55,140 --> 01:41:58,860
I think I would go with my,
I mean,

1556
01:41:58,861 --> 01:42:01,710
is it now or is he still alive?
They're both dead,

1557
01:42:01,810 --> 01:42:05,210
but we're assuming they're
still alive. He's alive. Yeah.
Yeah. Take it up as core.

1558
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:07,830
He's old and he's like, let's
go on this. Ferris. Well,

1559
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:11,510
this isn't an interesting distinction
he's making because if it happens to you

1560
01:42:11,511 --> 01:42:13,290
in your formative years,
in your youth,

1561
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:17,550
it could do long lasting damage if it
happens. At what age are we talking?

1562
01:42:17,551 --> 01:42:18,990
You're a child and this happens.

1563
01:42:18,991 --> 01:42:21,780
Are you an adolescent or are
you 40 something year old?

1564
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:26,250
Also if you're an adolescent, if you're,
if you're 17 you're going to come quick.

1565
01:42:26,430 --> 01:42:30,550
Sure. But now she's going to
be jerking me off for a while.

1566
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:33,960
Like the guy running it. Like when
you run that back, run that back.

1567
01:42:33,961 --> 01:42:35,390
We got to go another
round on the Ferris wheel.

1568
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:38,760
Well that's an interesting
with his fucking hands I hope.

1569
01:42:38,761 --> 01:42:42,940
Does their lube lube or is it just
that rough? No, no GRANDPA had rob,

1570
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:48,570
rob, rob, rob. Now here's

1571
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:53,250
what I'm going to do with this one
cause I hadn't considered the age.

1572
01:42:53,251 --> 01:42:57,140
I don't want to scar you emotionally too
much so I'm not going to do it to the,

1573
01:42:57,141 --> 01:43:01,020
to a child from now on. That's
great. 40 something year old.

1574
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:05,940
You're an adult and your grandfather is
like a couple of years before he dies.

1575
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:11,610
His hands are all decrepit and also
had 40 years of non retarded life.

1576
01:43:12,390 --> 01:43:16,590
Go back and become always taught it.
So you'll be born retarded

1577
01:43:18,180 --> 01:43:21,210
like of mice and men in
interviews talking about it.

1578
01:43:21,990 --> 01:43:24,630
So why did you choose
through a double special?

1579
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:30,780
Interesting. Interesting. They're like,
what's going on with you right now?

1580
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:35,480
I know the,

1581
01:43:40,350 --> 01:43:41,183
yeah.

1582
01:43:44,730 --> 01:43:46,050
Oh well my grandpa

1583
01:43:48,780 --> 01:43:52,070
live the rest of his life retarded.
That'll be crazy. Oh wait,

1584
01:43:52,090 --> 01:43:54,170
is it not the rest your life?
Well, that's what I thought.

1585
01:43:54,171 --> 01:43:57,560
I had assumed that you'd be born. We'd
go back in time and you're born retarded,

1586
01:43:57,561 --> 01:44:00,920
but you got to make choices,
right. It's all right now.

1587
01:44:00,921 --> 01:44:03,790
So that's why I think it
might be funnier if from now.

1588
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:06,260
I think it's better though. It's better.
So let's do, let's do it from that.

1589
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:09,110
From now on.
You're retarded from now on you.

1590
01:44:09,111 --> 01:44:12,560
That'd be hard to cause I've gotten lead
and then the amount of game I would not

1591
01:44:12,561 --> 01:44:16,490
have and your careers destroy it or less.

1592
01:44:16,491 --> 01:44:20,750
You'd become the retard it a comedian now.

1593
01:44:20,870 --> 01:44:22,730
My intellect wouldn't be
that. All right, the bits,

1594
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:27,860
but here's the thing we can start getting,
do you start getting sympathy tail?

1595
01:44:27,950 --> 01:44:28,783
Yeah,
for sure.

1596
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:32,660
How does it still look the same way
people will remember you before you walk

1597
01:44:32,661 --> 01:44:36,170
into a bar and then they're like, hey,
I saw you on Netflix and comedy central.

1598
01:44:37,090 --> 01:44:38,600
You would get a bunch
of women who would like,

1599
01:44:38,601 --> 01:44:41,240
we're already looked to me it was
like whatever, like but not enough.

1600
01:44:41,241 --> 01:44:44,450
Yellow is my favorite and
then they're like, Oh wow,

1601
01:44:44,451 --> 01:44:46,070
I've had a thing for Atar to people.
Yeah.

1602
01:44:46,220 --> 01:44:50,850
Also he was a funny comic wants this
will be good. That's a whole new ones.

1603
01:44:50,851 --> 01:44:53,540
A your sex game ticket,
big dive.

1604
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:56,150
You would never think about
pleasing somebody else,

1605
01:44:56,590 --> 01:44:59,810
but you've got to also think
I have retard strength. Yeah.

1606
01:44:59,950 --> 01:45:03,740
So hard to libido.
Don't forget they are very sexually,

1607
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:05,960
they took off constantly cause they
don't know like you're not supposed to do

1608
01:45:05,961 --> 01:45:10,430
this. Like why would you not so good you
guys to try it? Hate mail about that.

1609
01:45:11,220 --> 01:45:15,290
Really? She said that and some
someone wrote in, he's like,

1610
01:45:15,291 --> 01:45:18,350
I work with in special ed and she's like,
they don't all jerk off all day.

1611
01:45:18,351 --> 01:45:21,980
You fucking,
that's because you've done a good job.

1612
01:45:23,210 --> 01:45:24,920
They were so mad.
They were pretty upset.

1613
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:26,990
We're going to get some
mail on this one to think,

1614
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:31,850
but it's so worth the hate
mails. Never like, oh just
so you know. Some of them do.

1615
01:45:31,851 --> 01:45:34,400
To that, but generally that's like five,
10%. You're, you're off a little bit,

1616
01:45:34,401 --> 01:45:38,120
but it's all going fuck you
asked. Thanks. We're not teaching.

1617
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:41,270
Let me ask you this though. Now you're
going to have a decision but go ahead.

1618
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:42,133
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

1619
01:45:42,230 --> 01:45:47,080
Let's just tell us your decision and
then tell us why you chose that. Yeah.

1620
01:45:48,380 --> 01:45:52,280
I think I would go with my
grandfather jerking me off. Wow.

1621
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:55,580
I just don't want to be retarded man.

1622
01:45:56,660 --> 01:45:59,810
I just don't want retarded and I
fucked some gross people before.

1623
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:03,140
This would be way more damaging,
but I wasn't that close with,

1624
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:05,360
with papa or Saba.

1625
01:46:06,710 --> 01:46:09,830
How long do you think it would take you
to finish what it would take? A while.

1626
01:46:10,090 --> 01:46:12,890
One time I tried to jerk off in front of
two guys in the La Jolla comedy store,

1627
01:46:13,010 --> 01:46:14,090
the Condo.
Um,

1628
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:18,440
I try to work it up like real hard in
the other room and then come out and like

1629
01:46:18,441 --> 01:46:22,400
Jews in front of them. Yeah. When I came
out and realize how ridiculous it was.

1630
01:46:22,730 --> 01:46:24,890
It was about to come and then it was like,

1631
01:46:25,310 --> 01:46:29,600
you got a five more minutes now and I
need to go back for an hour. Go for it.

1632
01:46:30,030 --> 01:46:34,820
At the pressure of performance, it
was just like ridiculous and funny.

1633
01:46:35,150 --> 01:46:38,810
Were they laughing or were they one
was laughing. One was in horror.

1634
01:46:39,290 --> 01:46:41,780
I think I choose the latter. Yeah. Yeah.

1635
01:46:42,260 --> 01:46:45,920
I'm going to go grandfather jerking
me off. Wow. It would be rough.

1636
01:46:45,921 --> 01:46:50,250
It would take a while. It would
definitely damage me. Um Oh man,

1637
01:46:50,251 --> 01:46:51,084
it would definitely,

1638
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:53,820
the thing is that it's going to affect
the rest of your life would have a

1639
01:46:53,821 --> 01:46:57,060
definitely a new
relationship with my parents.

1640
01:46:57,810 --> 01:46:59,130
I have trouble looking at them,

1641
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:02,880
especially telling them like you have to
tell him one day, you don't want your,

1642
01:47:02,881 --> 01:47:05,450
you know what your dad did to me.
This game

1643
01:47:05,590 --> 01:47:06,840
should really be called would you

1644
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:09,540
lease rather? Yeah, of course.

1645
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:13,590
Leads us into one of the classic.
Would you rather,

1646
01:47:14,290 --> 01:47:17,700
and I know you're not obviously Christian,

1647
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:22,110
but like the biggest a celebratory day
in your house would probably be like

1648
01:47:22,111 --> 01:47:26,130
growing up. Would be the celebration.
Oh, you mean like Jewish?

1649
01:47:27,570 --> 01:47:30,420
Passover is more like a family
thing. Hanukkah, Hanukkah.

1650
01:47:31,860 --> 01:47:36,150
But everyone's together. Passover,
Passover, Rosh Hashanah, passover,

1651
01:47:37,730 --> 01:47:42,210
passover. Yeah. So it's Passover.
Everybody gets together.

1652
01:47:42,270 --> 01:47:44,790
Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1653
01:47:47,490 --> 01:47:51,830
Oh my God was really fucking,
Nah, you can leave the district.

1654
01:47:52,980 --> 01:47:55,130
Oh my God, you guys are so disgusting. So

1655
01:47:56,190 --> 01:48:00,090
if, uh, you guys have
your, you know, yeah,

1656
01:48:00,091 --> 01:48:01,740
you sacrifice your baby,
you do your,

1657
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:07,400
no, the non Jewish babies died.
Right? Okay. So Nikela dog,

1658
01:48:07,430 --> 01:48:10,500
you guys do your training.
You say your prayer, um,

1659
01:48:10,670 --> 01:48:15,530
you know there's one drop of Jewish, non
Jewish baby blood and that Motsa recipe.

1660
01:48:15,531 --> 01:48:18,710
If that's your furniture, one drop.
Don't fuck, it's not a whole baby.

1661
01:48:18,730 --> 01:48:21,020
We for sure we killed the
babies and put them out.

1662
01:48:21,021 --> 01:48:24,970
But like only one drop is
necessary. You're way off
base. I don't know all of the

1663
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:26,570
things, but you, you do your coin flip.

1664
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:30,710
Everyone sits there and then at the end,
right.

1665
01:48:30,711 --> 01:48:35,000
And is there like a big toast
and everything too? Okay,
so there's all this wine.

1666
01:48:35,270 --> 01:48:38,930
Then you say to your family,
you go guys,

1667
01:48:39,290 --> 01:48:41,240
I gotta show you something and you,

1668
01:48:41,270 --> 01:48:44,360
everybody goes from the dining
room to the living room.

1669
01:48:45,350 --> 01:48:47,900
I can already picture that. So everybody's
like, oh cool. And they're like,

1670
01:48:47,901 --> 01:48:51,050
what is it? Did you, did you shoot a new
show? What, what are you going to show us?

1671
01:48:51,051 --> 01:48:53,540
And you go,
just sit here and watch this.

1672
01:48:53,990 --> 01:48:58,190
And you put in a DVD and they're
all like waiting in anticipation.

1673
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:03,560
And by the way, pastor,
do you say happy Passover?

1674
01:49:03,561 --> 01:49:06,970
Like what are you guys happy wife?
Happy pays off.

1675
01:49:07,130 --> 01:49:11,810
Piss off or could Yontif good.
Yontif yeah.

1676
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:16,220
Okay. So that's for all holidays. So
they're all sitting in front of the TV.

1677
01:49:16,250 --> 01:49:17,083
You press play,

1678
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:22,540
your onscreen and 10 homeless guys
are standing around you and they go,

1679
01:49:27,231 --> 01:49:31,340
hold on, hold on. This
is one of the options.

1680
01:49:32,150 --> 01:49:32,983
Of course.

1681
01:49:33,170 --> 01:49:36,060
Video of both though. No, no,
no, no. It's one or the other.

1682
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:40,570
Otherwise it's like continuing and
they're getting divorced over it and then

1683
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:47,850
it could be late. Okay, so
let's say it's homeless,

1684
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:50,250
but they're homeless.
Homeless, right? Yes.

1685
01:49:50,590 --> 01:49:55,060
And they all masturbate
to completion on you

1686
01:49:56,750 --> 01:50:01,260
squirting or no? One that, yeah, cause it
could be like skirt and they're all like,

1687
01:50:02,050 --> 01:50:06,920
they're all really loud about it. It's
really uncomfortable watching. Yes.

1688
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:12,040
Wait, everybody, the last one ends,

1689
01:50:12,370 --> 01:50:16,430
you turn to camera and you say, uh,
how they pay us off. Yeah. Happy pay,

1690
01:50:16,431 --> 01:50:19,270
stuff like that. And then it cuts to
black and you turn back and you're like,

1691
01:50:19,271 --> 01:50:20,104
what do you guys think?

1692
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:25,150
It's either that or when you
put the DVD and you press play,

1693
01:50:25,330 --> 01:50:29,950
it's just you alone looking at the camera
and you masturbate to completion and

1694
01:50:29,951 --> 01:50:32,170
you say happy.
Yeah.

1695
01:50:32,660 --> 01:50:36,850
It's the shame that it's either you doing
the thing or having the thing done to

1696
01:50:36,851 --> 01:50:37,840
you.
That's shameful.

1697
01:50:41,390 --> 01:50:44,380
I mean there's so many different
people in the family, so yeah.

1698
01:50:44,650 --> 01:50:48,820
Well my mom and dad was most disappointed
with me versus like I could explain to

1699
01:50:48,821 --> 01:50:52,930
the nephews if we're always
just masturbating. My
sisters could be like, okay,

1700
01:50:52,931 --> 01:50:54,850
you're going to have to
learn this eventually. Yeah.

1701
01:50:54,851 --> 01:50:56,710
What are we was doing
was called masturbation.

1702
01:50:57,030 --> 01:50:58,950
You'll do it when you get a little older.
Yeah.

1703
01:50:59,590 --> 01:51:01,240
Can we take the children out of the room?

1704
01:51:01,270 --> 01:51:04,020
I think the children don't need
to be privy. I'm going to take,

1705
01:51:04,270 --> 01:51:08,230
I know what needs to be privy.
Let's change it to just adults.

1706
01:51:08,231 --> 01:51:10,130
I don't think it's fair
to put kids in that.

1707
01:51:10,780 --> 01:51:12,340
So I'm picturing me when I was growing up,

1708
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:17,390
maybe when I'm like 22 no one
has shown us kids yet. Correct.

1709
01:51:17,530 --> 01:51:20,410
Everyone's grown up.
Adults only is what we change it to.

1710
01:51:20,411 --> 01:51:23,770
Tom Children shouldn't watch the video,
but it's your mom is your dad.

1711
01:51:23,770 --> 01:51:28,600
It's your grandma, grandpa, brother,
sister. They've all, there's no children.

1712
01:51:28,630 --> 01:51:32,890
Okay. Looks fine. It's all adults.
Okay. Oh, can I say a problem with us?

1713
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:38,580
You can't use a DVD player on so
I'm like I got to put this a DVD.

1714
01:51:39,001 --> 01:51:42,220
Yeah, they'd be like, what are
you talking about? Here it is.

1715
01:51:42,310 --> 01:51:45,370
It's a live performance guys.
One of my friends,

1716
01:51:45,371 --> 01:51:47,620
they're all going to do this
with me versus all right guys.

1717
01:51:47,830 --> 01:51:50,800
And actually the way I got to come to the
backyard and they're all waiting there.

1718
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:55,720
Or originally the way I, I like this
one is to send out a company wide email.

1719
01:51:55,870 --> 01:51:59,980
Guys come to my desk at 1230 and everyone
shows up your boss and then you're

1720
01:51:59,981 --> 01:52:03,100
like, and then you, that's
a good way to masturbate.

1721
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:04,270
That's a good way to quit his job.

1722
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:10,670
But what would you guys do with
grandfather or retarded? I chose no,

1723
01:52:10,690 --> 01:52:14,800
I'd rather grandfather a
hundred percent wow. Yeah. I've,

1724
01:52:14,830 --> 01:52:19,000
I've lived a great life. I've had
all but my son, Shit grandfather,

1725
01:52:19,030 --> 01:52:22,670
I have to raise my kid but
I feel like it would like,

1726
01:52:22,750 --> 01:52:26,080
now that I think about it and talking
about it with you, it would take so long,

1727
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:30,520
so long go somewhere like focus
so intensely on it. You know,

1728
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:34,120
you'd have to block it out.
It's like so hard.

1729
01:52:34,150 --> 01:52:38,410
It's a really big about sexual stuff and
if you like at all pop up or if you get

1730
01:52:38,411 --> 01:52:42,280
that smell Begay
and every time he's like,

1731
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:47,210
oh throw it. And he's just just, you
know, and it wouldn't be good at it.

1732
01:52:47,211 --> 01:52:49,340
It's not like he's a fucking to
lick his hand the way it does.

1733
01:52:52,540 --> 01:52:53,100
Okay.

1734
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:56,340
Yeah. I ended up, if
you're like having trouble,

1735
01:52:56,341 --> 01:53:00,870
he'd be like going into your balls
and you're like, yes, yes I do.

1736
01:53:00,871 --> 01:53:03,570
I need help on my lap like old times.
Yeah.

1737
01:53:04,140 --> 01:53:08,510
You want me to do your
balls to your bald man?

1738
01:53:09,030 --> 01:53:13,900
Bald? My grandpa, I'm on airy.
So what's it going to be?

1739
01:53:14,090 --> 01:53:15,250
A funnel cake?
Yeah.

1740
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:21,540
So jerk off in front of my family or
have 10 girls kind of boot cocky you,

1741
01:53:21,570 --> 01:53:23,370
I mean originally it was 10 homeless men,

1742
01:53:23,700 --> 01:53:26,580
but I feel like we adapt it for male.

1743
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:29,980
They're really picturing men
and women homeless. Okay.

1744
01:53:30,580 --> 01:53:34,880
And they're being board said it had
a whole book. Does it smell? Yeah,

1745
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:42,610
that's what it sounds like.

1746
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:47,370
Oh my God.

1747
01:53:50,670 --> 01:53:52,920
This is the front of your face,

1748
01:53:59,980 --> 01:54:01,090
like in the back yard.

1749
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:05,990
I mean just

1750
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,990
going to watch or be like, Hey, get
off now. Just watch their roads with,

1751
01:54:10,050 --> 01:54:12,610
everyone just says watching it.
Just like shock and

1752
01:54:14,210 --> 01:54:17,370
so you're really thinking about
the conversation afterwards? Yeah.

1753
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:18,790
Talk us through your thinking.
Okay.

1754
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:20,370
You're thinking about
afterwards how to deal with it.

1755
01:54:20,371 --> 01:54:23,340
You're also thinking about if no one
was there, which one? I'd rather like.

1756
01:54:23,341 --> 01:54:25,800
I don't want to have homeless
people jizzing on me.

1757
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:30,630
Like it's not just about the reaction.
It's also like this is happening. Right.

1758
01:54:31,410 --> 01:54:35,010
Interesting point, but can't you
masturbate in front of your family?

1759
01:54:35,190 --> 01:54:38,030
That's another thing. Looking into your
mother's eyes, looking at your sister.

1760
01:54:38,031 --> 01:54:39,630
Right, right, right. Oh yeah.

1761
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:43,630
Well I mean like the homeless people
[inaudible] on you and squirting on you.

1762
01:54:43,660 --> 01:54:44,280
That could be,

1763
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:47,550
would you rather if the family is not
even involved because it's not even a good

1764
01:54:47,551 --> 01:54:50,370
thing. Yeah, but the family
adds a nice leg up for sure.

1765
01:54:50,370 --> 01:54:51,390
I'm saying it's a bad thing,

1766
01:54:51,391 --> 01:54:54,600
but masturbation without my family
is no big deal without your phone,

1767
01:54:54,630 --> 01:54:57,900
but we are family. It adds a whole other
level. That's why it's such an important.

1768
01:54:57,901 --> 01:55:00,780
Would you rather, this is
a seminal one, if you will.

1769
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:04,070
I think I know I'll get,

1770
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:09,080
my thinking is I could sort of throw it
off to them as like I was forced to do

1771
01:55:10,741 --> 01:55:14,790
this. I wasn't the one doing it. That's
right. Now. That was the law masturbating.

1772
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:17,730
That's right though.
It's a more normal thing,

1773
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:20,910
like obviously you know intellectually
that I do this when you're not around.

1774
01:55:20,970 --> 01:55:24,660
Right. And now the hall, man,
I bet it's a shell it that way.

1775
01:55:24,661 --> 01:55:26,190
It's a shame displacement.
It's,

1776
01:55:26,191 --> 01:55:30,360
it's either the shaming is done to you
or you're responsible for your shame,

1777
01:55:30,540 --> 01:55:33,870
so that's I think why it's
psychologically very provocative.

1778
01:55:34,230 --> 01:55:37,140
As I'm talking it through,
I might have just switched.
Yeah, I was going to go get,

1779
01:55:37,230 --> 01:55:41,760
get just done. Right. But I
think maybe now mastering,

1780
01:55:41,790 --> 01:55:44,070
but then I can't, the conversation,
they'd be like, no, you

1781
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:46,530
were doing that. Are you
were masturbating. Why did
you do that? It's past.

1782
01:55:46,531 --> 01:55:50,850
We asked you to stop. But we're saying,
hey, please stop. The other way.

1783
01:55:50,851 --> 01:55:53,660
It's like we asked the homeless people to
please stop and they did it. All right.

1784
01:55:53,661 --> 01:55:55,590
Get away from them, but I'm on
the ground. Yeah, and they have,

1785
01:55:56,070 --> 01:56:00,040
they take the responsibility, right.
What's happened? We made him do this. Oh,

1786
01:56:00,060 --> 01:56:03,620
they forced me. I mean, I lost a boy.

1787
01:56:05,830 --> 01:56:08,770
This is a really on the line with
the goals. When the ever you do it,

1788
01:56:08,850 --> 01:56:11,640
would you rather not have
people go, oh yeah. Hey,

1789
01:56:13,180 --> 01:56:15,260
it's the dilemma. Yeah. Yeah.

1790
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:22,950
I, I, I think the getting masturbated on,

1791
01:56:23,190 --> 01:56:27,000
do you prefer that one before?
I don't really like using that word.

1792
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:31,680
It's your preference.
It's what you find enjoyable.

1793
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:36,270
I think that there would be
that conversation of like,
all right, he masturbated.

1794
01:56:36,271 --> 01:56:38,760
Why don't you that in front of us? But
this is like, to what are you into?

1795
01:56:39,320 --> 01:56:43,710
That's all. That's what is, was become
ours of our sun. So That's interesting.

1796
01:56:43,711 --> 01:56:47,200
The shame of what are your
sexual preferences? Are you into,

1797
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:50,780
this is what our he's into versus
we don't know what our he's into,

1798
01:56:50,790 --> 01:56:54,420
but he's masturbating in front of us
and that's in your masturbated in their

1799
01:56:54,421 --> 01:56:57,870
house while they were there when
I was an orthodox Jew. Right.

1800
01:56:58,360 --> 01:57:00,820
Where you're supposed to not do
that. Oh for sure not. It wasn't,

1801
01:57:01,220 --> 01:57:05,510
there was no religion in the world that I
know of except, no. Even that that does,

1802
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:08,670
that allows it. Will you ever bring
stuff like that up in that era?

1803
01:57:08,710 --> 01:57:09,181
Would you be like,

1804
01:57:09,181 --> 01:57:12,750
I want to masturbate or would they talk
to you about stuff like that? No, no, no.

1805
01:57:12,751 --> 01:57:17,240
Even sex ed was having or core or
your folks Orthodox Jewish. They are,

1806
01:57:17,610 --> 01:57:20,410
they have gotten to the point where
if we're out and my dad's like,

1807
01:57:20,411 --> 01:57:22,500
if you want to get a burger,
you can get a burger. Oh really?

1808
01:57:22,620 --> 01:57:26,510
But that like took a lot. How,
how are they with your success?

1809
01:57:26,650 --> 01:57:30,300
Like I like my success. They don't
like the way I've achieved it. Uh,

1810
01:57:30,390 --> 01:57:33,810
like when I took my dick out on, on HBO,
my mom's like, why do you have to tell?

1811
01:57:33,811 --> 01:57:38,190
I told people to watch we're going
to be on TV. Why? And I'm like, mom,

1812
01:57:38,191 --> 01:57:40,950
you shouldn't watch this stuff.
It's, it's exactly not for you. Well,

1813
01:57:40,951 --> 01:57:43,910
they watch the special. Oh
yeah, they will. Yeah. Geez.

1814
01:57:43,930 --> 01:57:46,910
I got comedy central before they got
cable just so they could watch me. Really?

1815
01:57:47,050 --> 01:57:48,630
Yeah, they're proud of
me. I asked my aunt once,

1816
01:57:48,631 --> 01:57:51,990
I was doing some joke about like herpes
at the DC Improv and they were there and

1817
01:57:51,991 --> 01:57:54,930
then they left right afterwards
when I was like, what did they,

1818
01:57:55,740 --> 01:57:56,700
how did they feel about that?
She goes,

1819
01:57:56,701 --> 01:58:00,120
I think they just assumed you were joking
about like the setup and this payoff.

1820
01:58:00,210 --> 01:58:04,290
Oh, that it's all made up. Yeah. That's
good. I'm joking about having it though.

1821
01:58:04,590 --> 01:58:07,890
Not having it a fucking, excuse me.
Making love to a woman. Sorry Christina.

1822
01:58:08,100 --> 01:58:10,750
I love to a woman who had herpes. Oh. And
they were like, oh, there's just like,

1823
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:13,740
it's amazing how many people
like, well, they're like,

1824
01:58:13,741 --> 01:58:17,200
and so you just made that
whole thing up, right? No,

1825
01:58:17,220 --> 01:58:21,070
I just chose the funniest way to say it.
The amazing one to me is when the,

1826
01:58:21,071 --> 01:58:24,050
when people think you made up like a,

1827
01:58:24,570 --> 01:58:29,070
a super detailed story, like a story
that people give their like, so you may,

1828
01:58:29,071 --> 01:58:32,040
like I had a story about meeting
Mike Tyson and they were like,

1829
01:58:32,100 --> 01:58:35,590
you made all that up. He just made that
up. We really created if he could do that.

1830
01:58:35,610 --> 01:58:38,040
I mean, you kind of want to be
like, yeah, I think I'm creative,

1831
01:58:38,041 --> 01:58:42,220
but like you think I'm mean, I made up
all the beats of like converse. Like why

1832
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:45,070
would I make that? Yeah. But I
guess if they, if you don't do it,

1833
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:49,420
then you just assume now don't let them
see behind the curtain. And guys, come on.

1834
01:58:49,660 --> 01:58:54,100
I know, but it's just weird that
like that a plant you're like, yeah,

1835
01:58:55,170 --> 01:58:58,720
yeah, yeah. Now does your mom do that
thing where she, when she gets her period,

1836
01:58:58,721 --> 01:59:02,920
she goes to the water. The
Jacuzzi? Yeah. I like that a lot.

1837
01:59:02,950 --> 01:59:06,910
My mom hasn't gotten her period
since before Obama for sure.

1838
01:59:07,480 --> 01:59:09,100
Probably back in the day.

1839
01:59:10,930 --> 01:59:15,850
40 almost of natural water. Uh, that's an
a measurement of natural water you need.

1840
01:59:15,851 --> 01:59:20,380
Okay. After you have your period, you
need seven clean days. So no spotting.

1841
01:59:20,381 --> 01:59:24,460
No nothing. Count to like popcorn when
it pops and you're like three seconds,

1842
01:59:24,461 --> 01:59:29,250
you go want to pop. Okay, start
again. One, two, three Oh one, two.

1843
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:32,350
You know what? So you've got seven clean
days. No spotting everything he got.

1844
01:59:32,351 --> 01:59:35,290
Spot starts over. When you get
seven clean days, then yeah,

1845
01:59:35,960 --> 01:59:37,600
go to the Mikvah ritual bath.

1846
01:59:37,870 --> 01:59:41,490
You could also use a lake or ocean
because it's got plenty of water in their

1847
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:44,230
natural water, but not like a pool.
It's got to be like a natural,

1848
01:59:44,710 --> 01:59:45,940
it's gotta be rainwater coming up.

1849
01:59:45,970 --> 01:59:49,690
I always think about whenever I hear these
things like that, it's crazy, right? No,

1850
01:59:49,740 --> 01:59:52,820
just the amount of effort, just
effort. I guess we're all, well,

1851
01:59:52,830 --> 01:59:56,150
let me tell you this. In terms of like
what you said, like a practicality. Yeah.

1852
01:59:56,250 --> 01:59:59,890
So period, let's say three, five days,

1853
01:59:59,891 --> 02:00:02,560
but they had spotting
dead seven clean days.

1854
02:00:02,590 --> 02:00:07,590
Now Your Day 12 then the next day you
go to the Mikvah 13 and now you're,

1855
02:00:08,470 --> 02:00:12,400
you haven't fucked your husband in 1314
days tenure and you're at your most

1856
02:00:12,401 --> 02:00:15,100
fertile. Yeah, it's great. It's
actually a way of making sure

1857
02:00:16,870 --> 02:00:20,910
and also keeps you like, yeah. I think
also like just relationship wise you go,

1858
02:00:20,930 --> 02:00:22,870
he's got no road. So it's like
when you're apart from each other,

1859
02:00:22,871 --> 02:00:24,970
when you come back you're
like, oh, I can't wait to see
you again. Yeah, it's true.

1860
02:00:25,150 --> 02:00:29,520
Versus you've seen a lot of couples. You
should. I do. I liked what the Jews do.

1861
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:31,610
Good Shit.
Yeah.

1862
02:00:31,820 --> 02:00:35,650
But what are you Orthodox
Jew symbolically anymore?

1863
02:00:36,150 --> 02:00:39,470
Like did you do anything masturbate in
front of your family? Some of the foods,

1864
02:00:40,020 --> 02:00:42,310
I still get off on that
because I grew up with it.

1865
02:00:43,090 --> 02:00:46,960
But if I'm home I'll sing their
songs with them. You know,

1866
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:51,070
that just sounds really at this
point. But do they, is everybody,

1867
02:00:51,100 --> 02:00:53,560
here's the other thing, how, how
are they as far as they have,

1868
02:00:53,650 --> 02:00:56,770
they accepted your zip up.
My Dad wants in a while,

1869
02:00:56,771 --> 02:00:59,080
says he's from coming to shoulder mild,
you know, come with and I was like, no,

1870
02:00:59,260 --> 02:01:03,360
I feel bad. Last time I went home. So
you would say the grace after meals? Um,

1871
02:01:03,670 --> 02:01:07,930
there's this, if you have three or more
men above 13 as an extra prayer say,

1872
02:01:08,130 --> 02:01:12,370
and one person says that everyone like
joins in. So you say like it's in Hebrew,

1873
02:01:12,371 --> 02:01:15,760
but you say like bless it other for
giving us food and then it was like, yeah,

1874
02:01:15,761 --> 02:01:19,210
for real though. And then he's like,
thanks for all these people here.

1875
02:01:19,211 --> 02:01:22,250
I was like two totally. Yeah, it's just
a back and forth a little bit. Yeah.

1876
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:24,550
My Dad is like, you want to, you want
to lead this one? And I was like, oh no,

1877
02:01:24,551 --> 02:01:27,310
I don't, I don't remember this. And
he's like, no, you read another book.

1878
02:01:27,311 --> 02:01:30,580
And I was like, oh my mom's like,
we do it. And I'm like, ah, ah.

1879
02:01:31,270 --> 02:01:33,780
But then as soon as they
did and I was like, what the
fuck is wrong with me? Yeah,

1880
02:01:34,270 --> 02:01:36,640
just not converting.
If I could have done it,

1881
02:01:36,870 --> 02:01:38,980
if I was at a Buddhist thing and
they said, can you read this thing?

1882
02:01:38,990 --> 02:01:40,250
I would have done it.
Yeah.

1883
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:44,080
So it's like Beth because it's
family and children, but I mean like,

1884
02:01:44,210 --> 02:01:48,530
I feel bad about it. Yeah,
I understand. What, back to
the fucking question at hand.

1885
02:01:48,650 --> 02:01:53,310
Yeah. It hasn't chosen. Sorry.
It's so hard. Just think, no,

1886
02:01:53,790 --> 02:01:55,960
I don't.
I've never had somebody.

1887
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:02,000
It's the before and it's a door it
and it's the afternoon, the afternoon,

1888
02:02:02,001 --> 02:02:04,820
the drawing explaining to them, it's
like, of course they master it. It's like,

1889
02:02:04,821 --> 02:02:09,740
why don't you do that already? Why
is masturbation so, so taboo? Yes,

1890
02:02:09,741 --> 02:02:14,480
it is. For you. Your House,
it's not a normal thing. It's
not a natural occurrence.

1891
02:02:14,481 --> 02:02:19,481
Meaning that's the double thing of you
having Orthodox parents is that that's

1892
02:02:19,701 --> 02:02:22,830
off the table. Discussion wise,
why trust. Parents were like,

1893
02:02:22,850 --> 02:02:27,290
why are you doing that outside?
Right.

1894
02:02:27,860 --> 02:02:28,910
What's your choice?
What is it?

1895
02:02:33,480 --> 02:02:37,970
I think it's the homeless
people. Yeah. Yeah. No,

1896
02:02:37,971 --> 02:02:42,050
I think I chose, the other one I show is
doing it myself. He's got good parents.

1897
02:02:42,140 --> 02:02:45,560
I could tell them afterwards, the halls,
people like I wasn't into that. Right,

1898
02:02:45,561 --> 02:02:50,360
right, right, right. No, I understood.
I mean I, I, I got it. I just, I,

1899
02:02:50,540 --> 02:02:54,470
so I rejected all the other column.
I displaced the shame.

1900
02:02:54,650 --> 02:02:58,020
I prefer to put the shame on the
other people. What if want to be

1901
02:03:00,240 --> 02:03:03,500
to them. This is the, Oh
gee, would you rather, wow.

1902
02:03:03,530 --> 02:03:05,240
It's great when you come
across a good one. You're like,

1903
02:03:05,270 --> 02:03:08,120
I gotta remember this for next time.
Oh this one is like from, yeah,

1904
02:03:08,150 --> 02:03:12,410
this is like a six or seven year old
one. Yeah. I have one for you. For me.

1905
02:03:13,130 --> 02:03:16,550
You could do this to Eric.
Okay. Tommy, would you rather,

1906
02:03:17,870 --> 02:03:21,810
would you rather have your
mouth smell like fiefs FIFA,

1907
02:03:22,060 --> 02:03:26,760
Theo or dog? Her blind dog
smells like food. Is it

1908
02:03:28,300 --> 02:03:30,540
the other one I look at you.
Oh you don't want him to like it.

1909
02:03:31,890 --> 02:03:36,180
The halibut fucking, it's
horrible. Yeah. Okay.

1910
02:03:36,290 --> 02:03:41,290
So would you have either your mouth
smells like feet or my mouth smells like

1911
02:03:42,261 --> 02:03:46,000
fiefs yours. Why? What? Really? Yeah,

1912
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:49,220
but then you have to live with me and I
have a, I'll have a garbage mouth. Yeah,

1913
02:03:49,221 --> 02:03:54,140
I know you just have you. I just kiss
other parts, you know, just ruined her.

1914
02:03:55,220 --> 02:03:58,610
Her feelings. The woman you love like
this will be easier for you. Right?

1915
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:02,210
But easier for me to have your dog.
You don't have to smell his horrible.

1916
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:05,810
Now how bad smelling mouth anyways,
cause Dad's get dad mouth.

1917
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:09,230
You're going to have dad mouth
and like when you're 50 right?

1918
02:04:09,230 --> 02:04:11,900
Don't dad's mouth smell like shit.
Like older guys

1919
02:04:13,560 --> 02:04:17,630
smells like the deodorant they were
putting on and they, and they look like,

1920
02:04:17,780 --> 02:04:20,780
like older guys mouth looked
like they were just decomposing.

1921
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:23,450
Like you look at your mouth, you're
like, you look like a fucking,

1922
02:04:23,490 --> 02:04:27,550
it's like a corpse already. See, I feel
like it'd be, I'd be like, get it anyway.

1923
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:29,960
I think we would get to the point, I'd
be like, you know how your mouth is.

1924
02:04:30,190 --> 02:04:33,700
So you would be like, Hey,
can I get a kiss? I'd be like,
Hey, your cheek. You know,

1925
02:04:33,890 --> 02:04:37,650
like kiss you over
there smells horrendous.

1926
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:39,720
You wouldn't be able to sleep next to me.

1927
02:04:39,721 --> 02:04:43,840
Like I couldn't sleep with my head next
year. Head on the pillow, bedrooms.

1928
02:04:44,240 --> 02:04:47,060
I would just know. I'd just be like
face the other way, you know? You know,

1929
02:04:47,070 --> 02:04:51,050
you know you face your wall. Yeah.
I would have used smell like fiefs.

1930
02:04:51,130 --> 02:04:53,960
I would have the mask. Yeah. Yeah.

1931
02:04:54,210 --> 02:04:59,060
The other person has it fucking
day of my life. I want your life.

1932
02:04:59,300 --> 02:05:02,750
I would be talking to people and you
could, I mean if they had like my dogs,

1933
02:05:02,820 --> 02:05:06,270
if I had my dog's breath, I know
people would be like, oof Jesus man.

1934
02:05:07,080 --> 02:05:11,250
You want a mint? Normally strong enough.
You wouldn't be able to do anything.

1935
02:05:13,850 --> 02:05:18,840
I have a serious one for you guys.
Serious was wrong. Would you rather

1936
02:05:20,820 --> 02:05:25,570
never do stand up ever again or split up?
Oh God,

1937
02:05:25,620 --> 02:05:29,340
God. Cause I mean I put a lot
of people don't know comedians.

1938
02:05:29,341 --> 02:05:31,500
This is who we are at the core.

1939
02:05:31,530 --> 02:05:34,680
So like split up but just did divorce.

1940
02:05:34,681 --> 02:05:37,680
But we can still see each other like
split up meaning or you're done.

1941
02:05:38,820 --> 02:05:43,620
You're nice to each other. They'd be fuck
once a year. Yeah, we split the custody.

1942
02:05:46,290 --> 02:05:50,050
How's things going with you? Like
when you drop them off, the kids fine.

1943
02:05:50,370 --> 02:05:52,980
Sees both the parents.
You guys are both amicable.

1944
02:05:54,120 --> 02:05:58,990
I mean that would suck, but I'd have
to, I want our family be together.

1945
02:05:59,380 --> 02:06:02,730
I don't want my kid to grow up the way
I did is terrible. It's fine. It's fine.

1946
02:06:03,220 --> 02:06:07,590
It doesn't seem that bad.
It's not good. Split up.

1947
02:06:07,860 --> 02:06:11,330
But why? Well, here's the thing, you make,

1948
02:06:11,640 --> 02:06:15,630
you make a good living doing stand up.
You would really have to find another,

1949
02:06:15,631 --> 02:06:17,310
I mean the podcast is great too,

1950
02:06:17,370 --> 02:06:22,370
but that would really ruin your
livelihood and our livelihood jewelry.

1951
02:06:23,041 --> 02:06:27,360
You know what I'm saying?
We are split up a white diamonds.

1952
02:06:27,470 --> 02:06:30,310
Of course. I got it for
yesterday. Really Birthday.

1953
02:06:31,880 --> 02:06:36,690
I didn't know when your birthday was
coming. No one cares about in February.

1954
02:06:36,840 --> 02:06:41,660
Where do you want to go on
this trip? Oh yeah. Oh yeah,

1955
02:06:41,670 --> 02:06:45,930
I bet the bet. Yeah, I heard you
guys talking about your trip.

1956
02:06:45,931 --> 02:06:49,140
Well I pes
thank,

1957
02:06:50,850 --> 02:06:55,110
thank you is mine. I bought
it. It's hers now. Beautiful.

1958
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:58,860
There's tasting. Julie's
amazing washed up. Fuck man.

1959
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:05,120
So I talked to Bart Crysler
and the the the re obese.

1960
02:07:08,710 --> 02:07:13,650
Yeah. Bark Chrysler. Yeah. So what
is your opinion on his weight gain?

1961
02:07:13,651 --> 02:07:15,320
Has His uh, man, I don't know.

1962
02:07:15,321 --> 02:07:18,150
I was trying to spin the cause even when
he took his shirt off for that thing

1963
02:07:18,200 --> 02:07:21,300
and wait himself as not obese,
he still looks obese as fuck.

1964
02:07:21,540 --> 02:07:25,200
You mean at the actual way?
January 3rd I guess that's what it was.

1965
02:07:25,210 --> 02:07:28,890
That you saw him, you saw him with
me a few days ago. What'd you think?

1966
02:07:28,891 --> 02:07:33,480
He looked like? He looked, boy, he didn't
look like a fucking workout guy. Right.

1967
02:07:33,990 --> 02:07:35,980
But he said he definitely cut

1968
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:40,120
weight for the way in. Right. Well we
both call water worse, but like there's,

1969
02:07:40,360 --> 02:07:43,660
you put the water back on and it's barely,
it's nice.

1970
02:07:43,661 --> 02:07:46,390
His face doesn't look much
different than he did way before.

1971
02:07:46,391 --> 02:07:48,780
His belly is just so gross.
And like we were talking,

1972
02:07:48,781 --> 02:07:53,110
we saw on the back it's pushed out
where it's a hard, if he lost weight,

1973
02:07:53,111 --> 02:07:56,830
you should have that fold that fold over.
Yeah. Thing a little bit. A little bit.

1974
02:07:56,831 --> 02:07:59,620
Right. Do you feel like,
cause he was saying,

1975
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:02,750
I mean I'd like to get them back
on a scale. Maybe I will during a,

1976
02:08:02,860 --> 02:08:05,920
is it going a skank fest? I don't
know where he's going. He's,

1977
02:08:05,950 --> 02:08:09,340
he's on the road a lot. Um, if you,

1978
02:08:09,341 --> 02:08:11,870
if you were to describe
a, he said that, uh,

1979
02:08:11,871 --> 02:08:16,480
he was really upset that
people were saying he gained
the weight back. Yeah. Well,

1980
02:08:16,481 --> 02:08:20,630
he's, no, what he's upset about is that
he came in the white pack. Right. I Dunno.

1981
02:08:20,650 --> 02:08:24,520
Maybe. And I was like,
well, you know, he goes,

1982
02:08:24,521 --> 02:08:27,130
I have no,
here's what he said.

1983
02:08:32,070 --> 02:08:36,790
Yeah, it's a lot. And I
go, dude. And he goes,

1984
02:08:36,850 --> 02:08:41,850
I heard you say you did tell me there
was like just fucking Tom who's starting

1985
02:08:42,491 --> 02:08:46,750
up again. That'll get the book. Yeah. And
people have been tweeting him. Really?

1986
02:08:46,780 --> 02:08:50,920
Yeah. Like why did you get fat again?
Let's get him on a scale again. Yeah. Um,

1987
02:08:51,190 --> 02:08:54,150
but I don't know, you saw him,
at least for our audience,

1988
02:08:54,510 --> 02:08:58,780
for me to tell the difference between
two 20 and two 40. Yeah. You know,

1989
02:08:58,781 --> 02:09:01,420
he's a tall guy. You would
understand that. But he's a tall guy.

1990
02:09:01,810 --> 02:09:05,620
He's over six feet tall, well over six
feet tall. Well over six one you know,

1991
02:09:05,660 --> 02:09:08,890
well into the six six feats. I
think he's just under six one. Ah,

1992
02:09:08,891 --> 02:09:13,690
you're just under six feet. But he's
well over six feet. That's a liar.

1993
02:09:14,110 --> 02:09:14,943
I can't believe.

1994
02:09:15,010 --> 02:09:19,090
I can't believe after asking
for the fucking measurement
when you were well over

1995
02:09:19,091 --> 02:09:22,600
an inch short of, and you
said you're worth, there was
no, I said I was six feet.

1996
02:09:22,630 --> 02:09:26,290
You said you were six one I
didn't say six one one one.

1997
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:30,280
He said he was 61 which turned
out to be also not true. Yes.

1998
02:09:30,281 --> 02:09:33,880
So then they had to do new BMS. Yes. But
you guys both may have made it anyway,

1999
02:09:34,090 --> 02:09:38,520
but that being said, he is fat ago. Sorry.

2000
02:09:39,490 --> 02:09:44,490
He's obese again. Yeah. Don't know.

2001
02:09:44,720 --> 02:09:46,090
Don't know.
Just look at him.

2002
02:09:46,180 --> 02:09:50,260
I mean he's not doing anything that he's
supposed to be doing to lose the weight,

2003
02:09:50,830 --> 02:09:52,780
but he managed to before,
I don't know how he did it before.

2004
02:09:53,080 --> 02:09:55,910
It talks to people who only cram for
tests and still manage to get A's. Yeah.

2005
02:09:56,220 --> 02:09:58,810
This isn't the way it's gonna
work, but he does. His version is,

2006
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:01,330
it's the Mickey Mantle Gene.
Mickey Mantle on. Yeah.

2007
02:10:01,870 --> 02:10:05,680
That was really funny about that bat
was the phrasing of it, where you go,

2008
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:10,800
what was it? It was just cute out
of obesity. Just get out of it.

2009
02:10:10,960 --> 02:10:14,620
That's all you have to do. Just don't
be OPB overweight. The overweight,

2010
02:10:15,490 --> 02:10:19,260
just don't be a medically
obese. And by the way, the lack,

2011
02:10:19,610 --> 02:10:24,490
the lack of faith in either of us was
also hilarious because he was like,

2012
02:10:24,491 --> 02:10:28,010
only one or you can do it. I don't
think your book do it in a way. Yeah.

2013
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:31,120
It's like if you really did have a good
workout, I was like, yeah, for sure.

2014
02:10:31,121 --> 02:10:34,250
But I didn't think either one of them.
Can I ask you one thing? It's so dumb

2015
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:37,250
and it's like such a minor dumb question,
but I've been thinking about it.

2016
02:10:37,610 --> 02:10:41,270
There is a time during their weigh ins
were Joe called you and you were abroad

2017
02:10:41,570 --> 02:10:43,950
and he kept calling you and calling you.
And like

2018
02:10:44,810 --> 02:10:49,310
I was a, I was out with Comedians in New
York. We're out eating trust Korea. I was,

2019
02:10:49,740 --> 02:10:50,573
I left the next day.

2020
02:10:50,610 --> 02:10:54,660
Why did you not just answer the phone
like you kept answering and then you'd

2021
02:10:54,661 --> 02:10:55,140
hang up?

2022
02:10:55,140 --> 02:10:56,800
Oh,
it's because of this,

2023
02:10:58,450 --> 02:11:01,350
because I have this new feature on my
phone that it just a, if I moved slightly,

2024
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:03,950
it'll just answering my pocket.
Oh Wow.

2025
02:11:04,040 --> 02:11:06,590
This whole time I'm like,
why would I do that?

2026
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:08,720
I can understand why you
would do that to somebody.

2027
02:11:08,940 --> 02:11:11,430
Yeah. It was a day before I left
was the first way. And, and I,

2028
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:14,850
and I waited till I guess midway through
that second podcast. That's why I left.

2029
02:11:14,851 --> 02:11:18,000
So weird. Yeah. That's all it
was. And then when I finally
saw it was like, oh, what?

2030
02:11:18,030 --> 02:11:21,870
I was kinda drunk with the guys.
Okay. And uh, I'm like, what a jerk.

2031
02:11:21,930 --> 02:11:23,900
Why don't you just pick up the phone?
And that was hitting me with it too.

2032
02:11:23,901 --> 02:11:26,160
It's like, let me show you
the way ads. Here's what
number. I was like, wait, wait,

2033
02:11:26,161 --> 02:11:29,510
I don't, I need to know what the BMS
like what are they have to beat down.

2034
02:11:29,580 --> 02:11:33,810
Slow down. You got word that that we were
basically whatever add it or near it.

2035
02:11:33,811 --> 02:11:34,890
What you like.
Fuck.

2036
02:11:35,070 --> 02:11:38,490
Like did you feel a little bit also fun
but also like I'm all about competition.

2037
02:11:38,510 --> 02:11:40,810
Yeah. So I'm like, I want
the exact measurement. Yeah,

2038
02:11:40,811 --> 02:11:45,150
you're just like the easily
did it. I'm like man, cause
slow down. Slow down. Yeah,

2039
02:11:45,480 --> 02:11:49,620
we do have the have you. You got it.
Bye Bye. The way after your new weight,

2040
02:11:49,680 --> 02:11:54,450
your new height of five something
unbelievable. Unbelievable. This guy.

2041
02:11:54,580 --> 02:11:59,430
Yeah.
You were 0.15 of an inch above obese.

2042
02:12:00,840 --> 02:12:04,290
If you were 0.1 5.15,
if you were,

2043
02:12:04,590 --> 02:12:09,310
if you were five 11.7 instead of five
11.85, you would be about obese. Yes.

2044
02:12:09,311 --> 02:12:12,730
So for the next day it's like, hey man,
if he gains, I'll pound back. Yeah,

2045
02:12:12,780 --> 02:12:15,720
I win the bet. So I'm so I'll say like,
let me see the fucking competition.

2046
02:12:15,870 --> 02:12:19,530
Oh my goodness. I have never strict
on a goddamn single bedroom, my life.

2047
02:12:19,650 --> 02:12:22,610
So what are we going to do though? What
should we do? Let's do something. Uh,

2048
02:12:22,620 --> 02:12:26,980
August the iron man I'm through. I have
a pretty good busy fall. That's my whole,

2049
02:12:27,020 --> 02:12:32,000
let me ask you a question, but
what about in November? Me,

2050
02:12:32,001 --> 02:12:36,470
n n Burt will be in New Orleans to go
on that joker's crews we'll be launching

2051
02:12:36,471 --> 02:12:40,370
from there. Yeah. So maybe something
is November football season.

2052
02:12:40,400 --> 02:12:44,060
I'll say it again. What do you
like be fun? Um, nobody really,

2053
02:12:44,120 --> 02:12:48,050
you know what would be right. We have to
put it off obviously a little bit. Yeah.

2054
02:12:48,140 --> 02:12:52,400
Would be in probably end of January.
Yeah. I don't even know where it is.

2055
02:12:52,440 --> 02:12:55,040
I look it up. Yeah. Uh, the
national championship game,

2056
02:12:55,310 --> 02:12:58,850
that'd be fun to go to basketball.
No, wait, what'd we call it? Football.

2057
02:12:58,851 --> 02:13:01,850
College football. Yeah. That'd be good if
you're a huge college football fan. Yeah.

2058
02:13:02,210 --> 02:13:06,590
Okay. That'd be fine. It's
always on a Monday and the
Oh, right. That's great. Yeah.

2059
02:13:07,220 --> 02:13:10,610
Okay. Let's do it. We could
do that. Was your team at Fsu,

2060
02:13:11,180 --> 02:13:13,890
they have no chance next year or they
do, no, I mean a, there'd be there,

2061
02:13:13,910 --> 02:13:17,530
they're going to be a pre season top
10. Yeah. So there's a chance. Yeah,

2062
02:13:17,531 --> 02:13:19,460
there's a chance, but
either way, be quiet.

2063
02:13:19,461 --> 02:13:22,670
They also opened the season against
Alabama. That'd be their show.

2064
02:13:22,671 --> 02:13:25,610
They'll get there. They'll
get a pretty good, uh,

2065
02:13:25,760 --> 02:13:28,890
the jump up if they win that and they
still have it. Oh yeah. When that, yeah.

2066
02:13:28,900 --> 02:13:33,720
They'll, that'd be the talk station. Yeah.
Yeah. Um, yeah, that'd be good. I didn't,

2067
02:13:33,750 --> 02:13:38,460
I liked the idea of going to a, to
um, Barcelona, I'll be honest to you.

2068
02:13:38,580 --> 02:13:41,820
That was rooted in truth.
I also knew how,

2069
02:13:42,390 --> 02:13:45,510
how retarded it kind of went off.
But then when it was like,

2070
02:13:45,630 --> 02:13:48,660
actually like when we were
like, Hey, let's do it. I was
like that'll be super fun.

2071
02:13:48,661 --> 02:13:51,600
Super Fun. Yeah. I'll stay in like
a big like an airbnb together.

2072
02:13:51,601 --> 02:13:52,434
I thought that'd be fine

2073
02:13:54,030 --> 02:13:57,480
or folly cause they were playing the end
of the games ended up being like crazy

2074
02:13:57,481 --> 02:14:00,780
good game. Oh really? One of the, uh,
one of them was I think one of them,

2075
02:14:01,080 --> 02:14:04,920
well there was a big shocker cause I guess
they have, they had multiple, you know.

2076
02:14:05,360 --> 02:14:10,070
Yeah. Yeah. So there
was one big upset or um,

2077
02:14:10,200 --> 02:14:13,710
I think Paris beat Barcelona but no
one was expecting on the first one.

2078
02:14:13,940 --> 02:14:17,070
And I think there's a game after that
were Barcelona went messy play for

2079
02:14:17,071 --> 02:14:21,510
Barcelona you guys. Yeah. Yeah.
Wow. Yeah that would have been fun.

2080
02:14:21,750 --> 02:14:24,270
It would have been fun man.
But anyways, by the way,

2081
02:14:24,271 --> 02:14:26,730
I had my plan set up cause you're like,
oh I fly first class and I'm like,

2082
02:14:26,731 --> 02:14:28,110
you know what, it is
your flight. That's fine.

2083
02:14:28,290 --> 02:14:31,320
And I was already had a set like you're
flying first class and Bert and I are in

2084
02:14:31,321 --> 02:14:34,530
the back
by the way.

2085
02:14:34,531 --> 02:14:38,670
I know they would have harassed me
the entire flight bird. Oh yeah.

2086
02:14:38,700 --> 02:14:39,533
He would have been like

2087
02:14:45,020 --> 02:14:48,450
to be told you can't be up here. And he
would have been so upset to be in coach.

2088
02:14:48,480 --> 02:14:53,210
So upset plus the middle seat.
I was going to get him. Oh God.

2089
02:14:53,300 --> 02:14:55,130
It's the worst.
Yeah we have to do,

2090
02:14:55,160 --> 02:14:58,180
we'll have to do some national
championship game would be pretty,

2091
02:14:58,181 --> 02:15:00,990
we look it up just saying. Yeah. Let
me see where it's got a lovely, okay.

2092
02:15:01,050 --> 02:15:05,910
Is that soccer? Yeah. Jesus Christ.
Fucking now definitely split up.

2093
02:15:07,940 --> 02:15:09,360
That would be a cool one for sure.

2094
02:15:10,050 --> 02:15:11,970
And then I could finally stop
getting comments on all my fucking,

2095
02:15:11,971 --> 02:15:14,970
everything I post, I
call me a Welsh. Yeah,

2096
02:15:16,650 --> 02:15:21,210
it's an upcoming game. It will be
played in Atlanta. Atlanta. Yup.

2097
02:15:21,270 --> 02:15:22,230
January 8th hey,

2098
02:15:22,231 --> 02:15:27,210
can we go to the vortex and get that
peanut butter Banana Burger? Absolutely.

2099
02:15:27,211 --> 02:15:31,380
Annotate a new stadium. A new state of the
art. I'm really billion dollar stadium.

2100
02:15:31,381 --> 02:15:34,470
Yeah. Fuck yeah. That can
be fun. Okay. What is it?

2101
02:15:34,471 --> 02:15:39,330
January 31st January 8th January 8th
yeah. Is it cold? That seems way early.

2102
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:41,390
No, no, no, that's right. They
do the New Year's eve stuff

2103
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:48,740
in Atlanta. It gets, it gets cold but not
that cold. It'll be fine to go to, well,

2104
02:15:48,741 --> 02:15:53,250
it's very jackets. Do you want to go want
to do that? Yeah, that could be a thing.

2105
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:57,090
Yeah. Let's do it. I'll, I'll, I'll not
scheduling anything ahead of time now.

2106
02:15:57,170 --> 02:16:00,090
All right.
We'll probably go for like the weekend.

2107
02:16:00,150 --> 02:16:01,290
You got to go for a couple of days.
Yeah.

2108
02:16:01,291 --> 02:16:03,540
You don't want to just land and go to
the national championship game, but yeah,

2109
02:16:03,541 --> 02:16:07,370
we'll go for this. Even go Sunday
and then stay Monday, Tuesday,

2110
02:16:07,370 --> 02:16:09,600
Wednesday something. Yeah.
Oh, too bad it's there.

2111
02:16:09,601 --> 02:16:12,920
Cause we could be like go
fishing or whatever. We can
figure it out so much. Okay.

2112
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:14,870
Hell yeah, that'd be great. Okay.

2113
02:16:15,370 --> 02:16:17,730
I hope I kill myself before that so
I don't have to actually pay it off.

2114
02:16:21,010 --> 02:16:24,480
So, uh, I might have to get two seats
for Bert if he keeps going at this rate.

2115
02:16:26,250 --> 02:16:31,060
That's totally true. So enormous. I
wonder if it's just that, you know,

2116
02:16:31,061 --> 02:16:34,540
we always see him shirtless. We never
see him. That was my theory, by the way,

2117
02:16:34,640 --> 02:16:37,990
when those, true, when he told me, he
goes, when he said like everyone's saying,

2118
02:16:37,991 --> 02:16:39,790
I gained all this weight back. I go, dude,

2119
02:16:40,420 --> 02:16:43,180
every place you go you
don't have a shirt on. Yeah.

2120
02:16:43,240 --> 02:16:48,160
Most people not even like forget obese,
like the average person shirtless.

2121
02:16:48,300 --> 02:16:51,860
It isn't like, wow, you look great.
You know, what can I tell you what,

2122
02:16:51,870 --> 02:16:53,270
maybe a retort to that?
Yeah.

2123
02:16:53,330 --> 02:16:57,460
I took my shirt off constantly around
Manhattan or anywhere that's shorts off

2124
02:16:57,470 --> 02:17:01,120
for sure. Suns out, guns
out, you know? Yeah. And uh,

2125
02:17:01,900 --> 02:17:04,660
when I had my shirt off, especially after
I got back, people are like, Oh man,

2126
02:17:04,661 --> 02:17:07,770
you're so thin, Andrew. Lose weight.
Right. And with him, they're signs.

2127
02:17:07,771 --> 02:17:12,580
Did you gain weight? It's just cause the
baseline product isn't good. Right, right,

2128
02:17:12,581 --> 02:17:15,070
right. How right. So like
no, same way as before,

2129
02:17:15,190 --> 02:17:19,390
but I will say this,
I will say this,

2130
02:17:19,450 --> 02:17:22,770
if I walked around all the time shirtless.
Yeah.

2131
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:26,270
It's not going to be compliments men.
No, it's not going to be like, yeah,

2132
02:17:26,290 --> 02:17:30,610
no one's going to, but like most
people have the sense minus him.

2133
02:17:30,611 --> 02:17:33,220
Wonder how much that weighs. I want
to, I want to get a scale. What do you,

2134
02:17:33,221 --> 02:17:35,890
what would your guess be if you had
to guess? Right now? I don't know.

2135
02:17:35,900 --> 02:17:39,350
Two 93 95 I don't think it's three

2136
02:17:43,420 --> 02:17:46,590
she's like, is that's gotta be off
by like 10 pounds. I don't know, man.

2137
02:17:46,650 --> 02:17:51,650
It's gotta be like two 78 to 84 real.

2138
02:17:52,571 --> 02:17:55,590
Even if, forget the way back. He's
not above two 40 yeah, but yeah,

2139
02:17:56,650 --> 02:18:01,540
I think to 20 yeah, no to 22 and
you add two to 19 the well, the,

2140
02:18:01,550 --> 02:18:06,010
the final day I was two 16 and he
was two 20 I think. Yeah. Yeah.

2141
02:18:06,750 --> 02:18:10,930
I would have loved if I want to hop back
and it the BMI and rugged and have to

2142
02:18:10,931 --> 02:18:15,100
go, oh fuck the boost and
boost seven grants per calorie.

2143
02:18:15,580 --> 02:18:19,840
That's really hard to lose weight
and drink. Whenever I see a woman,

2144
02:18:19,870 --> 02:18:21,990
especially in the comedy scene and
suddenly it's like when I'm seeing them in

2145
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,850
six months and it's like, hey you
look great. Like what has been doing,

2146
02:18:24,900 --> 02:18:29,850
it's 90% of the time stopped
drinking. Absolutely. That's
the one thing you can't,

2147
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:31,540
you can't do both man.
You can't lose weight.

2148
02:18:32,410 --> 02:18:36,670
I was gaining weight when I was traveling
for the first month and I was like,

2149
02:18:36,680 --> 02:18:38,830
am I getting [inaudible]
this isn't making sense.

2150
02:18:38,831 --> 02:18:43,050
I mean you're like no processed
foods. I'm active as fuck. Yeah.

2151
02:18:43,130 --> 02:18:45,640
And then my friend was like
Chang wait drinking beers

2152
02:18:49,180 --> 02:18:51,040
like 20 ounces for like a dollar.

2153
02:18:51,041 --> 02:18:54,870
Everyone is a psycho though where
he will go like you know if you,

2154
02:18:54,890 --> 02:18:57,250
if you go on his Instagram
it's like every night he's like

2155
02:18:59,080 --> 02:19:03,870
40 people and then the next day he
goes and he runs. He does. Yeah. Oh,

2156
02:19:03,950 --> 02:19:05,360
so Hayden, the gates, the damage,

2157
02:19:05,700 --> 02:19:08,200
he does that self regulating
thing where he's like,

2158
02:19:09,660 --> 02:19:14,140
recall the four in the morning and
you're running all over five miles. We,

2159
02:19:14,150 --> 02:19:17,380
you crazy. You can't emphasize
your liver though. Yeah.

2160
02:19:17,950 --> 02:19:22,220
No Sim two years from now.
God, he was so great. Yeah.

2161
02:19:22,370 --> 02:19:23,203
Was a good guy.

2162
02:19:23,510 --> 02:19:27,350
It's kind of at least she have a living
memorial for him living funeral. He goes,

2163
02:19:27,351 --> 02:19:27,980
thanks.
So we can really

2164
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:29,570
feel his friends come
out. Yeah, we should have,

2165
02:19:29,571 --> 02:19:31,160
we should do that before his heart attack.
What?

2166
02:19:31,800 --> 02:19:36,080
It's like how to live in more than
in Atlanta, but book them for a show.

2167
02:19:36,350 --> 02:19:38,540
You want to do this show
and then when he shows up,

2168
02:19:38,570 --> 02:19:41,870
just have like the big photo on
that. You know what I mean? Yeah.

2169
02:19:41,910 --> 02:19:44,420
The flowers underneath it.
Yeah. Oh, that would be great.

2170
02:19:44,840 --> 02:19:47,570
And have people just to have say
some words, music playing. Yeah.

2171
02:19:47,600 --> 02:19:50,030
It's the intervention. Is that it?
Yeah, he'd be, he'd be like, you know,

2172
02:19:50,031 --> 02:19:53,770
this is a real fucking bummer.
He'd be so upset for us to map.

2173
02:19:56,420 --> 02:19:59,720
It's too real though. It's
too close. Yeah. Reality. Um,

2174
02:19:59,900 --> 02:20:04,750
did you ever have like a horrible
office corporate job? Yeah. Yeah.

2175
02:20:05,050 --> 02:20:06,710
It's up to the health network.

2176
02:20:07,190 --> 02:20:10,130
Do you guys ever do like cool from
stuff getting to know each other?

2177
02:20:12,720 --> 02:20:16,980
No.
Look at the people fairly copic.

2178
02:20:17,380 --> 02:20:18,213
Oh Man.

2179
02:20:23,540 --> 02:20:24,373
Yeah.

2180
02:20:30,980 --> 02:20:33,590
So everybody's doing this.
Wow. All girls by the way.

2181
02:20:34,460 --> 02:20:36,050
Well a guy wrote in that he had,

2182
02:20:36,080 --> 02:20:40,670
he had to do one of these and he wrote in
that uh, he was like, my name is Kevin.

2183
02:20:40,730 --> 02:20:41,540
Yeah.

2184
02:20:41,540 --> 02:20:45,800
And I killed a man and if you really do
all whole thing stopped cause he was in

2185
02:20:45,801 --> 02:20:46,940
Afghanistan.
Yeah.

2186
02:20:47,010 --> 02:20:50,720

2216
02:23:02,990 --> 02:23:06,260

you take a job at Walmart,

2232
02:24:30,611 --> 02:24:33,300

factor like there was no,

2233
02:24:33,340 --> 02:24:36,490
not a lot of heavy responsibility.
You clock in, you clock out,

2234
02:24:36,491 --> 02:24:38,200
you don't have no one's
fucking watching you,

2235
02:24:38,410 --> 02:24:40,840
and then to have to suffer
through that corporate nonsense.

2236
02:24:41,080 --> 02:24:43,660
It takes a whole fun out of working
there in the first place. I would

2237
02:24:43,660 --> 02:24:46,600
love to that point. I would love to see
the end of that video when he's like,

2238
02:24:46,601 --> 02:24:48,940
Whoa, we have a class, and
somebody goes, hey man, I quit.

2239
02:24:50,200 --> 02:24:53,230
He put your name tag down and walk
out. Yes. The guy that goes like,

2240
02:24:53,231 --> 02:24:55,710
I don't want to see in these fucking
songs. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2242
02:25:00,700 --> 02:25:03,290

your manager. You don't do what I want.

2243
02:25:05,620 --> 02:25:10,480
I really enthusiastic thing.
I'm going to be a cashier one day.

2244
02:25:10,960 --> 02:25:14,200
All right. Better in terms of like letting
you know, because it should have been,

2245
02:25:14,230 --> 02:25:16,570
if it was the real song, this
should be like two more verses. Yes.

2246
02:25:16,720 --> 02:25:18,880
He let you know what the
handoff that this song was over.

2247
02:25:18,910 --> 02:25:21,080
He did a way better job in
the Groundlings. Do. Yeah.

2248
02:25:21,250 --> 02:25:24,100
It's what you like indigo
spending. That's true. He

2249
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:25,810
knew there was a, there
was a time limit. Yeah.

2250
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:26,753
Yup.

2251
02:25:37,160 --> 02:25:37,993
That was for sure.

2252
02:25:44,470 --> 02:25:45,303
Yeah.

2253
02:25:49,740 --> 02:25:53,410

not? No, he does not sound good
on that. Yeah. Social. Yeah.

2257
02:26:04,020 --> 02:26:07,180
Very Jesus. I'm trying to think. I had a,

2258
02:26:07,740 --> 02:26:10,300
I used to work at a company
called world link. Yeah.

2259
02:26:10,320 --> 02:26:14,220
That's sold airtime for infomercials.
It was really bad.

2260
02:26:14,221 --> 02:26:18,180
Nine to five and I remember they used
to just have us come in and on quarterly

2261
02:26:18,181 --> 02:26:22,320
meetings and then they would go over the
earnings and then we'd have to clap at

2262
02:26:22,321 --> 02:26:25,470
the earnings and you'd be like,
yeah, but I'm making $5 an hour.

2263
02:26:25,890 --> 02:26:29,820
I'm clapping for the fucking CEO. 68
million in profit. That's awesome man.

2264
02:26:29,910 --> 02:26:30,743

But that was great when they didn't have
these demeaning Shibuya is in session.

2266

Shibuya we had icebreakers,
but that was like in like dorm jobs.

2268
02:26:41,680 --> 02:26:44,780
Social. I hate situations
where they go, where'd it go?

2269
02:26:44,781 --> 02:26:48,590
Around the room and say your name

2270
02:26:48,620 --> 02:26:52,340

had to go around doing the same thing.

2275
02:27:06,531 --> 02:27:09,410
You split up into twos and then do
something interesting about yourself,

2276
02:27:09,411 --> 02:27:11,330
where you're from,
and then you reported in the other person.

2277

who was interviewing me, I was like,

$2 and he ended up winning.

I hope it makes it on the show.

2334
02:31:16,810 --> 02:31:20,220
I left the third verse open for
the Mommy Rappers to rap on.

2335
02:31:20,220 --> 02:31:22,530
I love the podcast.

I have a question for you.
Hold on.

2341
02:31:40,110 --> 02:31:45,110
You know how when you go to Fart but
you shit and it's called a chart.

2342
02:31:47,880 --> 02:31:52,020
But what about when you go to take a shit
and you only fart? What's that called?

2343
02:31:55,160 --> 02:31:59,680
Not a fit. A fit. That's a good
one. We haven't heard that one.

2344
02:31:59,860 --> 02:32:02,950
Is it a what? A thump. Fart dub. Yeah.

2345
02:32:04,030 --> 02:32:07,370
How does that happen to you guys? A lot.

Are you ready for this?

2349
02:32:16,760 --> 02:32:19,550
Someone said if you feel a ship but
only for it, you had yourself a fit.

2350
02:32:20,300 --> 02:32:24,260
Someone says that. Perfect. Perfect
one says it's the gene pool.

2351

Uh, we call it a Makana. Hey,

do when I go to the road? No,
no, no. Oh you, you leave.

2358
02:32:57,950 --> 02:33:01,970
You don't, don't send them to a Kennel. I
have a guy on the east side. Do you live?

2359
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,010
Oh, but you're in New York
exclusively now. Yeah.

There's people that you can take
them to. It's normal. Yeah. Oh,

Oh, number. Cause you're going to do so.

2362
02:33:12,350 --> 02:33:14,060
Here's the thing we were talking
about is that I should be,

2363
02:33:14,061 --> 02:33:19,061
I should have been doing fart videos
when we were poor in 2008 I easily could

2364
02:33:19,911 --> 02:33:23,510
have done it and I was thinking of Fart.
Fart,

2365
02:33:23,590 --> 02:33:28,320
mistress.com oh no, you
just fart. Dishonest. Sorry.

2366
02:33:28,370 --> 02:33:32,320
Porn. You just fart. Like be
like this lady. Easy, easy head.

2367
02:33:32,850 --> 02:33:34,080
Yeah.
There's a reason

2368
02:33:40,720 --> 02:33:41,470
like $300

2369
02:33:41,470 --> 02:33:44,710
right there. What do you mean
puts it on our website? Yeah.

2370
02:33:45,120 --> 02:33:48,910
You guys pay Webcam stuff. Money
for nothing. Checks for free. Yeah,

2371
02:33:49,480 --> 02:33:53,430
I do that anyway. Wow.
I mean I, wow. Yeah.

2372
02:33:53,530 --> 02:33:56,980
That's a great way to earn extra cash
and the guys want to see girls do it,

2373
02:33:56,981 --> 02:33:59,320
do it in any way doing it anyway at home.

2374
02:33:59,770 --> 02:34:02,260
I have the perfect scenario
for make to make you,

2375
02:34:02,320 --> 02:34:04,970
for your public Queen Atripla debut.

2376
02:34:05,650 --> 02:34:09,280
You need to find the longest escalator
or moving sidewalks and I can,

2377
02:34:09,700 --> 02:34:10,750
I try to go the whole way.

2378
02:34:11,230 --> 02:34:14,140
I think what they're saying far
past people to get their reactions.

2379
02:34:15,130 --> 02:34:18,140
I did this before at a Disney world in

2380
02:34:18,300 --> 02:34:21,940
man manhole, Florida to several
groups of unsuspecting mommy's.

2381
02:34:21,941 --> 02:34:24,280
I would pay to watch this.
Oh my God. It's got farts.

2382
02:34:24,281 --> 02:34:26,890
Shame and discuss all the
making of early retirement.

2383
02:34:26,980 --> 02:34:31,970
You do the math by mommy.
Thanks. Jeans. Ethan mistress.

2384
02:34:31,990 --> 02:34:36,900
We'll consider this submission. Yup. Yeah.
I farted a check it over. Try or you,

2385
02:34:36,901 --> 02:34:40,450
I'm sorry.
You like to read

2386
02:35:04,480 --> 02:35:06,430
the next sentence in the fucking story.

2387
02:35:09,500 --> 02:35:13,540
He's like a monster.
It is easy money.

2388
02:35:13,990 --> 02:35:18,160
Why wouldn't you do it? You should do
it. It's weird to sexual though, right?

2389
02:35:18,430 --> 02:35:20,070
It's supposed to be fetish.
Yeah.

2390
02:35:20,680 --> 02:35:24,850
I think you guys are onto something with
this fart mistress idea. A couple ideas.

2391
02:35:25,150 --> 02:35:27,400
I had my be fart.

2392
02:35:27,401 --> 02:35:30,810
Mistress 40 gets pulled over
and has to fart her way out of

2393
02:35:32,980 --> 02:35:36,970
a, we should write some
fart fart. Like long form.

2394
02:35:37,300 --> 02:35:39,730
Is fart mistress pregnant or just gassy?

2395
02:35:39,760 --> 02:35:43,840
A trip to the doctor and
fart mistress meets big foot.

2396
02:35:43,870 --> 02:35:48,400
You'll never guess what happens next.
Thanks for taking the time to read this.

2397
02:35:48,401 --> 02:35:52,270
I wish you luck in your
fart MREs endeavors. Best
regards gains the butt plug,

2398
02:35:52,271 --> 02:35:55,420
kind of sore. J D hey, have
you ever gotten a colonoscopy?

2399
02:35:56,730 --> 02:36:00,480
It's supposed to, yeah. I'm so, I got
one to look at those fucking hemorrhoids.

2400
02:36:00,580 --> 02:36:01,000
Yeah,

2401
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:05,680
they blow air into your rectum so it's
like wide open and then they look at

2402
02:36:05,681 --> 02:36:10,180
whatever they got to look at and then
afterwards you just full of air so you

2403
02:36:10,181 --> 02:36:11,020
feel like you have to ship,

2404
02:36:11,021 --> 02:36:14,140
you don't and then you fart
for about two straight days.

2405
02:36:14,230 --> 02:36:17,600
Really just farting out
air but crazy farm raise.

2406
02:36:17,601 --> 02:36:21,960
You should charge for your next one and
have like a live feed of that fart and

2407
02:36:21,961 --> 02:36:26,220
people can pay to watch and it's not
about it. I went straight to him,

2408
02:36:26,260 --> 02:36:28,630
they actually right from there and I'm
just like, I had to lie on the ground.

2409
02:36:28,631 --> 02:36:32,260
Just fart the whole time. See
you capitalized. Oh thank God

2410
02:36:34,460 --> 02:36:38,590
that I have drank a full glass of
water and this full bottle of Fiji.

2411
02:36:38,740 --> 02:36:43,000
You guys have not even come close.
Well I mean constantly.

2412
02:36:43,250 --> 02:36:48,130
I mean I had that and I this
coffee, nothing like another one.

2413
02:36:50,970 --> 02:36:53,200
Anyway,

2414
02:36:55,800 --> 02:36:58,120
I done been done for a minute,

2415
02:36:59,900 --> 02:37:04,060
It was the current champion.
I am. Oh really? Please.

2416
02:37:04,360 --> 02:37:08,410
I'm also the observation champ, but
that's another thing we'll go into later.

2417
02:37:08,960 --> 02:37:10,990
We're going to do,
we're going to wrap this up.

2418
02:37:13,390 --> 02:37:14,470
Just let people know again,

2419
02:37:15,050 --> 02:37:20,050
the special is coming out double negative
children and adulthood on Netflix.

2420
02:37:20,450 --> 02:37:25,430
July, July one eight, July one eight.
Um, and then are you working on,

2421
02:37:25,470 --> 02:37:27,180
are you already working on
building your next night?

2422
02:37:27,860 --> 02:37:30,520
My next special is gonna be all
about Judaism. I've decided, yeah,

2423
02:37:30,880 --> 02:37:33,240
I'm going to truly try to like
flush that out and exercise it.

2424
02:37:33,660 --> 02:37:36,860
Are you going to do it like in a Collin
way where it's like a almost like one

2425
02:37:36,861 --> 02:37:38,240
man show.
It's not going to look at it.

2426
02:37:38,241 --> 02:37:40,070
I mean I have that to couple
of years in Edinburgh,

2427
02:37:40,071 --> 02:37:42,410
so I really sort of like been
influenced by those one man.

2428
02:37:42,620 --> 02:37:44,990
That's like fee and type shows,
but um,

2429
02:37:45,020 --> 02:37:49,870
workout or clubs and like make
it like funny, like American
stand up. Yeah. Um, uh,

2430
02:37:50,660 --> 02:37:53,870
that all you want. But like, uh,
yeah, column would be a good one.

2431
02:37:54,050 --> 02:37:56,600
The Way Neil Brennan did three mikes.
It's interesting.

2432
02:37:56,750 --> 02:38:00,260
I'll watch a lot of stuff like that
and see how I'll figure out a mixture

2433
02:38:00,261 --> 02:38:04,880
between like the stories laws and
like tradition. Great. Awesome man.

2434
02:38:05,500 --> 02:38:08,690
Yeah, I've got about like 20
now. It's pretty shitty early on,

2435
02:38:08,691 --> 02:38:11,910
but I mean you just started,
you know, it'll get there.

2436
02:38:12,740 --> 02:38:15,910
What's the name of the new special? Say it
again? Double negative. Double negative.

2437
02:38:16,460 --> 02:38:19,850
It's a double feature
to double feature album.

2438
02:38:20,210 --> 02:38:23,860
Will it play as one you'll play as to
one stops the next little just like

2439
02:38:23,870 --> 02:38:24,860
automatically start playing.

2440
02:38:24,861 --> 02:38:28,520
I was like a new episode starts or if
you just watch one and then leave the 45

2441
02:38:28,521 --> 02:38:33,020
and 45 so they're like manageable
amounts of time. Smart to do.

2442
02:38:33,021 --> 02:38:36,080
Not 60 60 smart. I think so, yeah.

2443
02:38:36,110 --> 02:38:40,570
Also it was too hard to get a crowd to
like really be in for an hour. Yeah. Yeah.

2444
02:38:41,120 --> 02:38:45,450
Talking about this for not for two
hours, I mean, yeah, for comedy.

2445
02:38:46,210 --> 02:38:49,880
Yeah. And then if you don't play it on
Netflix, would you come back and be like,

2446
02:38:49,881 --> 02:38:51,470
do you want to resume playing?
You know,

2447
02:38:51,480 --> 02:38:54,770
just like any stop watching house of
cards. Do you want to presume that?

2448
02:38:54,800 --> 02:38:59,450
Do you want to resume ours refers
double negative house of cards.

2449
02:38:59,950 --> 02:39:04,010
I heard of it.
Coach farts a foreign so sorry,

stopped the first year. Oh you did?

2451
02:39:09,920 --> 02:39:14,660
I couldn't get over and talking to me.
You just seem like I really enjoy it.

2452
02:39:14,750 --> 02:39:17,060
Yeah, no, it was good when I watched
it. I actually liked it. I just,

2453
02:39:17,200 --> 02:39:21,560
we're working to try like
seven episodes in total.

2454
02:39:22,040 --> 02:39:25,460
No, no, no. To the new season.
Yes. All right. We got to go.

Thank you guys for listening to the
show. Thanks for having me, you guys.

2456
02:39:28,391 --> 02:39:31,220
It's been a while since I've been on
here long. Two houses ago or something.

2457
02:39:31,450 --> 02:39:36,410
A long time. Yeah. I think I was on
this podcast in three different places.

2458
02:39:37,140 --> 02:39:41,990
Red Bands in the department. That's
right. Your, your your beach house.

2460
02:39:46,920 --> 02:39:51,440
Maybe silver, like Silver Lake House.

2461
02:39:51,620 --> 02:39:55,580
We had Ethiopian food wafting
through because our neighbor was,

2462
02:39:55,640 --> 02:39:59,430
we shared walls right next to that
hey place, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2463
02:40:00,770 --> 02:40:03,620
Cool. And the back. It's fine.
That was a good time. All right.

2464
02:40:03,830 --> 02:40:06,350
All Times or good times. Are you
