North Dakota.
So I've not been there,

39
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.060
Let's get the show on the road.

40
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.043
Here we go.

41
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.520
<v 0>Well,
this is new tonight.
A family has had enough.</v>

42
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.690
They say a woman is defecating on their sidewalk near Briar Gate and union in

43
00:02:55.691 --> 00:02:56.650
Colorado Springs.

44
00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.090
The family says they've caught her in the act twice now they've begged her to

45
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:03.520
stop,
but now springs police are getting involved.

46
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.670
<v 1>Christina pushes,
it's increased</v>

47
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.490
<v 0>the mad hooper.
Colorado Springs is good.</v>

48
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.090
I thought for a second when I heard this story that it was you who?

49
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.470
Oh cause I was in Denver,
Colorado.
Yeah.
I thought it was you.

50
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:15.430
What are you talking about?
This is a very handsome news reporter.

51
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.980
What?
What?
She's a very handsome woman.
Why do you say that?

52
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:24.370
It's kind of like,
it looks like a dude with a Bob Haircut,
right?

53
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.950
Like legit.
Is it a transgender?
No,
that's not.
Why are you doing that?

54
00:04:29.951 --> 00:04:33.400
That's not nice,
but here's why I'm being a jerk about this stuff.

55
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.180
Because if you work in television,
you should be attractive,
Babe.
God,

56
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:39.760
your vicious.
Sometimes it's the truth.

57
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.330
I demand the same excellence from the males too.
Just so you know.

58
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.010
What's Your Pronoun?
Well,
there you go.
I'm,
I'm harsh around the guys.

59
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:52.030
Believe me actually.
She really is.
Especially the old hound basset hounds.

60
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.830
I am on Morley safer.
Yes.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

61
00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.280
He's dead.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think he died the week after he retired.

62
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.870
He retired and then he died like a week later.
Maybe a month.
Yeah.

63
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.770
Got To work right up until the end.
Huh?

64
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.150
I know it is funny because you are the first person to point that out to me and

65
00:05:10.151 --> 00:05:11.380
I'd never thought about it.

66
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:15.280
So one of those things you don't think about where you would walk by the TV and

67
00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:19.270
you'd be like,
ah,
they allow this guy on TV and I'd be like,
what?
And you're like,

68
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.260
he's so ugly.
They would never let a woman like that on TV.
And then I was like,

69
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.520
I started to,
the more you think about it as you watch TV,
if you,

70
00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:31.270
if you've never thought about it,
think about it now and you're like,

71
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.490
that's definitely true.
That dude looks like a dog.
Shit.

72
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.100
It's hot dog shit.
All Dog Shit.
And if you look at,

73
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.540
especially in the sports world,

74
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.140
like now my God works is that they got these cuties down on the ground

75
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.920
interviewing the coaches and they're hot,

76
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.630
they're hair's all curled and tendrils and they've got the,

77
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:52.120
the other thing I did short skirts.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

78
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:53.890
The little hotties on the sidelines,
that's uh,

79
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.280
that's been a phenomenon for the last 15 years or so.
The,

80
00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.390
<v 2>um,
and like,</v>

81
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.220
<v 0>yeah,
sometimes you're like,
does she really?
Is she really,</v>

82
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.670
does she understand sports?
Cause I assure as some of them really,
really sure.

83
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.330
But then you got the Basset Hound gang that's a,

84
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.750
the ESPN guys after I've talking about the game for five hours and you're like,

85
00:06:13.751 --> 00:06:18.460
these guys look like Shit,
look like shit.
Yeah.
Thing is,
uh,
their dad jokes.

86
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.840
I,
how would I even get into the point of unbearable,

87
00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:25.780
just accepting their humor,
like being like,
oh,
that's part of it.

88
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.460
And now I judge it more harshly.

89
00:06:27.461 --> 00:06:31.450
Like these fucking tools making their terrible jokes.
And they're like,
right,

90
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.290
like look like a Scott,
what he's doing right now.
And then they're like,
oh.

91
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.210
And they act like it's really bad about that.

92
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.860
And especially because they can hire comedy writers,
doesn't it?

93
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.710
There's no shortage of funny people in the world to write for years.

94
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.340
Supposedly locker room banter like them just be in guys.

95
00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:51.190
But a lot of it's super late.
Terrible.
Yeah,
I can agree.

96
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.890
I Wa I don't even watch it with you.
That's your one.

97
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.010
That's I would say the one thing you and I really don't share as a hobby.

98
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.320
This is football,
but I'll walk.
No,

99
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:04.380
I'll walk into the room and I'll hear some stupid joke and you can have separate

100
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.200
interests,
you know,
of course.
No,
I know.
I'm just like,

101
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:12.440
I feel like some people are like,
you know,
the whole,
we do everything together.

102
00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:17.380
We're not together.
No,
we're,
we're a bonded pair.
That means we knew everything.

103
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:23.320
<v 2>Jump into the fact that,
I mean,
obviously this young lady,</v>

104
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:28.440
uh,
is a Colorado and uh,
be,
uh,
we were there.
Uh,

105
00:07:28.441 --> 00:07:33.441
I shot a special this weekend and a Denver and mom for Colorado and there was an

106
00:07:34.571 --> 00:07:36.910
awesome,
awesome experience.
Great night.

107
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.670
Thank you to everybody that came out.

108
00:07:39.671 --> 00:07:44.230
I even added a show the night before at comedy works and that was really fun.

109
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:49.470
I was so scared going into the week because I was sick.

110
00:07:49.661 --> 00:07:53.230
The sickness that you know here in Christina's voice.
Thank you.
Uh,

111
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:54.970
and I was anxious man,
because you know,

112
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:59.230
you're going into a taping and you don't feel good and you're coughing your

113
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.010
throat doesn't feel right.
And nasal drip.
I mean it was,
it was terrifying.

114
00:08:03.011 --> 00:08:06.730
I mean I really had anxiety about it,
not about the show,
just about being sick,

115
00:08:06.731 --> 00:08:11.280
you know?
And thankfully the day of the Sh,

116
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.540
the night before the show,
if I,

117
00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:16.630
honestly I had considered canceling that comedy works show cause I was like,

118
00:08:16.631 --> 00:08:19.900
what am I doing?
You know,
I'm taping tomorrow,
I don't feel good.

119
00:08:19.901 --> 00:08:23.170
I'm doing another show.
I don't need to do this show.
But I was like,

120
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.040
I'll just do it.
And I did it and then I was like,
I'm going to bed.

121
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.750
And I got some Nyquil,

122
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.660
took my meds and I got good sleep.
Like,
I got solid,
you know,

123
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.540
eight hours or something or I woke up and I was like,

124
00:08:37.541 --> 00:08:41.410
I don't feel like absolutely dragging.
Like I'm exhausted right now.

125
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:45.670
And that put me in a good mental place that like I got good rest.

126
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.970
I was still sick,
but I was,
I was coming out of it,
you know,

127
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.270
like I still right now I just have like the lingering last effects of it.

128
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:57.150
But I had the,
I had the,
you know,
the thought like,
Oh okay,

129
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.940
I'm well enough to get through and then you arrived.
And um,
I got,

130
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.740
I got sick before I came and that right.
But I'm saying when you got there,

131
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.540
we were like,
no,
let's just get in bed.
So we got in bed,

132
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.250
turn the lights off again.
This is why we're married.
Yeah.
And we,
and we tried to,

133
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.740
I think we slept for like another half hour or something like that.

134
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:22.050
And then we got lunch and then it was like,
okay,
like the routine,
you know,

135
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.260
the day is getting going and we just kind of,
we eased into it.

136
00:09:25.261 --> 00:09:30.180
We just took it easy.
Yeah.
And then that night,
I mean that was nuts,

137
00:09:30.181 --> 00:09:31.530
right?
Like those crazy,

138
00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.620
you know what I didn't realize because I haven't been going with you on these

139
00:09:34.621 --> 00:09:35.191
shows,

140
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:38.430
like I've just been only hearing about them because we don't travel together

141
00:09:38.431 --> 00:09:43.431
anymore because of the kid really is how many fucking people where they're like,

142
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:49.430
you've told me the numbers and then until you see like a theater of people who

143
00:09:50.011 --> 00:09:54.600
are so geeked to be there and these people were so pumped,
it was so fun.

144
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.550
I was like,
oh my God.
Like how are you this normal?
Like if that were me,

145
00:09:59.551 --> 00:10:01.370
I'd probably just be freaking out.
Like I'm like,

146
00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.910
they're going to hate everything.
Wait,
why do you say that part?

147
00:10:03.911 --> 00:10:05.640
I just have a negative self talk.
But you,

148
00:10:05.641 --> 00:10:10.560
I feel like how does it not make you like an unbearable egomaniac?
I,

149
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.660
I'd be like,
I don't know how how you deal with it.
It's normal.

150
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.300
I mean,
God,
there's so many people here.

151
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.800
I'm not an unbearable that you go maniac to begin with and you're not,

152
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.580
it's not your nature,
but you do.
You do dislike people.

153
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:33.180
I mean somewhat,
somewhat,
but I mean,
I like,

154
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.030
he goes funny.
I was like,
we talk about things on this show.

155
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.510
Like I always make jokes about like I don't like crowds and I don't like,

156
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.970
I don't want to fucking,
you know,
I have,

157
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:45.450
I've had jokes in my act like I'm all friended up and all this stuff and when

158
00:10:45.451 --> 00:10:47.670
you say those things in your act and you talk about it,

159
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:52.140
then people end up like people,
I meet people after shows and they go,

160
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.700
I know you don't want to meet me right now.

161
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:58.260
I know this is your least favorite part of this.
And I'm like,
no,

162
00:10:58.261 --> 00:11:01.520
because it's always super nice people.
Yeah,
of course.
I'm like,

163
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:06.450
that's not what I'm talking.
I'm talking about just the masses,
you know,

164
00:11:06.451 --> 00:11:10.530
like loud,
nondescript.
I think people individually are great.

165
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.750
It's the crowds where you're,

166
00:11:12.751 --> 00:11:16.680
you don't know what will make you hate people going to an NFL game,

167
00:11:16.681 --> 00:11:20.430
all blues and the Broncos game.
And like you're just seeing,

168
00:11:20.431 --> 00:11:21.840
I mean there's great people at the game,

169
00:11:21.841 --> 00:11:26.841
but there's just the loud of noxious drunk scumbags that Phil every NFL stadium

170
00:11:28.981 --> 00:11:32.460
and you're like,
oh my God,
can they just put these people down?

171
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:37.050
There should just be a scumbag area where like if you want to be drunk and

172
00:11:37.051 --> 00:11:40.710
annoying,
go there.
You know what I was,
I was amazed by that show.

173
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.240
The restraint that I saw these,

174
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:47.300
like they're throwing a guy out and he was wearing a purposely gigantic

175
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.140
oversized cowboy hat.
Oh boy.
And uh,

176
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.260
he was a cowboys fan cause the cowboys were playing the Broncos and uh,

177
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.620
him and his friends were getting tossed out and he was just like,
to these guys,

178
00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:03.040
he's like,
fuck you,
you fucking pigs.
And I was like,

179
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.760
who in society does that?

180
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.730
Like who scumbags,
right?
Like we were just watching and I'm like,
hello.

181
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:15.280
How out of your mind are you?
Like,
you're like,
suck it,

182
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:20.430
you fucking pigs to that to like to cops and cops don't police case.

183
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.770
Yeah.
Like he's,
and he's like,
you fucking,

184
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:29.320
and like double the double birds.
I like pointing to his Dick,
fuck you,

185
00:12:29.321 --> 00:12:30.160
you piece of shit.

186
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:35.410
And then they're kind of slowly walking towards like very calmly and they're

187
00:12:35.411 --> 00:12:40.390
like,
and then he kept backing up and he had this giant oversized hat on,

188
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.850
like not a regular cowboy hat.
It's like purposely enormous.

189
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.450
And then I look over at other cops in the,

190
00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:49.030
in the car and they're looking and they're like smiling.
And I was like,

191
00:12:49.031 --> 00:12:50.020
you sitting there like,
you know,
we see him,

192
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.670
we see him like your life sucks and then you're going to take it out on the

193
00:12:54.671 --> 00:12:58.450
police at the game.
Yeah,
you got a football game.
We do want to get out on them.

194
00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.090
That's why People Act Fools in public.
Right.

195
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.190
They can't control their lives and they get out in public and they,

196
00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.220
they're going to control this.
Right.
I'm going to know you.

197
00:13:06.221 --> 00:13:08.960
I'm going to show them that.
As much as I like football,

198
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.220
as much as I like football,
every time I go to a game,
I regret going to a game.

199
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:16.900
Yeah,
well cause it's the,
it's the uncontrolled masses.
As a collective,

200
00:13:16.901 --> 00:13:17.920
we suck as humans.

201
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:21.010
I think I would like to go to a game if I could get a field pass.

202
00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:22.150
Well let me call him,

203
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:25.660
stand on the sidelines for the simple fact that I would love to watch football

204
00:13:25.661 --> 00:13:29.590
live and not be near another human being.
You can't,

205
00:13:29.591 --> 00:13:34.070
you get like super private boxes.
Yeah,
I've done boxes.
I,

206
00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:37.930
I'm conflicted about boxes.
Boxes are really like,
it's a,

207
00:13:37.931 --> 00:13:41.710
I guess it's kind of the,
it's,
it does isolate you and it's kind of a luxury.

208
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:47.620
It's nice,
it's nice.
But,
um,
no,
it's good perspective.
You know,

209
00:13:47.621 --> 00:13:52.450
like you,
you see the game,
but I feel kind of removed from it.
I mean,
you know,

210
00:13:52.451 --> 00:13:56.560
like when you go to like whatever a high school game,
you know,
you can,

211
00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.730
you can walk on the sideline or like close to it.
You know,
I like,

212
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.180
I like being like down on the field.
I do like it and I know you can get that.

213
00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:09.540
I've talked to some people about getting a field pass to a game before and

214
00:14:09.551 --> 00:14:11.680
they're like,
yeah,
yeah,
we can arrange that.
But I mean it's,
you know,

215
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.500
it's not like you can,
you go on stub hub and be like,
feel past.

216
00:14:14.501 --> 00:14:17.650
It's like you have to,
you have to make it to be special.
You have to make calls.

217
00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:22.300
Um,
yeah,
I liked that.
I liked it.
You're out about hating people.

218
00:14:22.301 --> 00:14:26.950
I liked that you out at me on this show about being an La Snob and how you hate

219
00:14:26.951 --> 00:14:31.180
everywhere.
Everywhere.
That's not home.
It's not la La.

220
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:34.780
I don't even give a shit.
My favorite part about that for you though,

221
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:38.710
cause I kind of feel this way a little bit too,
is um,

222
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:43.080
everybody feels free to shit on la.
Like it's like,
uh,
you know,

223
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:47.040
and so a lot of times people are like,
when I meet them,
they're like,

224
00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:50.830
where do you live?
Oh,
I live in La.
They're like,
I can't stand it.
And I'm like,

225
00:14:50.831 --> 00:14:52.160
we're,
we're the fuck do you live?

226
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.210
<v 0>And then they,
you know,
they list wherever Toledo or something.
I'm like,</v>

227
00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.790
is that great?
And they're like,
I like it.
I'm like,
yeah,

228
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.420
I like where I live to fuck you.
Right.
That's kind of how I feel about it.

229
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.980
It's not that I think la is better than everywhere else.
It's familiar.

230
00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:12.530
No,
I don't like unfamiliar.
I would like to correct you.
You think La Better?

231
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:17.200
It's better for me because it's familiar to me.
I'm like,

232
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.760
I know that you're a better,
worse places to live in the world.

233
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:23.270
What's great about being home?
It's home and like,

234
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:27.200
I like my nice weather.
I don't care about the traffic.
It doesn't bother me.

235
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.420
I don't fucking care about celebrities doesn't bother me.

236
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:33.450
I like it when people go,
I can't do all that Hollywood stuff.
I'm like,

237
00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:37.110
what are you,
what?
Don't worry about it.
You won't have to.
Uh,

238
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.230
I like Avocados.

239
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.970
I like fresh produce oranges and stuff that aren't gray.
Well,
once you,

240
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.400
I mean gray bananas.
That's what I see on the east coast.

241
00:15:46.401 --> 00:15:50.810
When I go to these places like buffalo or Syracuse,
whatever,
it's all gray.

242
00:15:50.811 --> 00:15:53.390
Bananas.
Fucking getting your bananas from Dude,

243
00:15:53.391 --> 00:15:57.110
come to California and Shit's all yellow here.
Fucking bro,
Bro.

244
00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.060
He has don't even know what an avocado looks like.

245
00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:01.910
I've been in parts of this country where they have not even seen an avocado

246
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:06.230
fruit.
Ain't the right color man shit from Mexico.

247
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.300
Dude.
Wait,
can we talk about this pooper?

248
00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.140
Yeah,
we can,
but I also wanted to one last,
um,

249
00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.030
I mean I really wanted to say it meaningfully.

250
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.250
Thank you to everybody in Denver because that was,

251
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:24.670
that was a thrill for me to shoot a special in a city that I've,

252
00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.440
I know I've always told you I love Denver.
I do.

253
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:32.240
And you guys came out and the shows were fucking there are so fun.

254
00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:35.390
It's going to be such a great special and I'm really excited for people to be

255
00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:37.550
able to see it on Netflix.
Right.

256
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:43.100
Do we have an ETA on when it may drop?
People keep asking me.

257
00:16:43.101 --> 00:16:46.940
I mean they haven't told me that all park,
they'll give me a ballpark.

258
00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.830
I know that typically they do to three to four month turnaround.
Yeah.

259
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:54.050
But sometimes they change it up,
so we just don't know.
That's true.

260
00:16:54.051 --> 00:16:56.270
Because I fill mine in June and then it's dropping in October.

261
00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:01.430
Right on that schedule.
So there you go.
So around there.
Um,
all right,

262
00:17:01.431 --> 00:17:03.440
so there's a lady pooping and calling things,

263
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:08.960
but the altitude gets me every time and mom or I'm very sensitive to it.
Yeah,

264
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.260
yeah.
That was a fun and stuff.
It does.

265
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:20.690
Spencer,
this is so gross.
So gross.
You've ever heard somebody say that?

266
00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:24.170
According to the buddy family about once a week,

267
00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.660
they're getting all too familiar with the paper towel.

268
00:17:26.661 --> 00:17:30.740
She wipes with nasty surprise.
She leaves,
she nasty.

269
00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:35.010
She's so nice to take off that one piece.
SPANDEX,

270
00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:38.150
she's wearing a one piece units,
right?

271
00:17:38.151 --> 00:17:40.880
That means she's got a strip completely naked to take a shit.

272
00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:45.380
So she's getting down to titties.
She crazy as hell.
Right?
Extra crazy.

273
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.950
Kathy Buddy and her family have had enough

274
00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:53.410
<v 3>and it's not like it's private.
People can see you.
I mean we're saying hers</v>

275
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:57.970
<v 2>pants around her ankles in broad daylight.
Her kids saw it happened first.</v>

276
00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.720
<v 3>They come screaming and you know,
you're not going to believe this.</v>

277
00:18:01.721 --> 00:18:04.540
They were like crying.
It's like quiet.
And they're like,

278
00:18:04.541 --> 00:18:07.030
there was a lady taking a boat and so I came outside.
I was like,

279
00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:11.170
Oh dear goodness.
And so I was like,
are you serious?

280
00:18:11.171 --> 00:18:15.340
Are you really taking a poop right here in from my kids?
And she's like,
yeah,

281
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.473
sorry.

282
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:21.130
<v 2>Just,
yeah,
sorry.
She didn't have an excuse.
Like I have diarrhea,</v>

283
00:18:21.131 --> 00:18:24.040
I can't find a bathroom.
Like it's clearly a runner so I could get,

284
00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:27.250
if you're like,
oh this happened,
you know,
like I,

285
00:18:27.251 --> 00:18:31.960
I panicked this emergency.
But it doesn't sound like that's what's happening.

286
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:36.220
Cause running makes you have to poop.
Yeah,
but I mean that's what I'm saying.

287
00:18:36.221 --> 00:18:39.790
Like in the running I've done,
I've still never had to be like,

288
00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:42.430
oh my God right now,
right here I have to go.
I'm like,

289
00:18:42.431 --> 00:18:45.970
maybe this lady has a bowel problem,
like an abs thing.

290
00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:50.680
But listen to this though,
Kathy says,
if that was it,
there wouldn't be a problem.

291
00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:55.430
<v 3>I thought for sure she's mortified it was an accident.
She'll go get a dog bag,</v>

292
00:18:55.431 --> 00:18:59.870
come back,
clean it up and never run here ever again.
I'm not the case.

293
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:03.910
<v 2>Kathy says the runner knows what she's doing and comes with Napkins and her</v>

294
00:19:03.911 --> 00:19:07.980
pockets
and nasty.

295
00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.040
Here's the other thing,
Nancy.
Jesus.
This is why I have a theory.

296
00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:16.470
<v 3>There's a bathroom across the street right here.
Um,
our park has port-a-potties.</v>

297
00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.360
Um,
there's a gas station right here.

298
00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.170
<v 2>She's even working on an embarrassing smear campaign,</v>

299
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:25.970
posting this sign to get her to cut the,
well,
you know,
cut the

300
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.660
local news.
Uh,

301
00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:36.230
this lady is totally getting off on shitting in public.

302
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.790
That's,
this is the equivalent of a man who pulls his dick out.
You know,

303
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:45.680
it is,
it's a sexual arousal necessarily section.

304
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:49.520
There's a thrill.
There's some type of thrill going on.
She likes,

305
00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:53.060
she likes taking a dump in public,

306
00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:57.170
wiping it there either people seeing her and going like,

307
00:19:57.171 --> 00:20:01.100
are you really doing this?
And she's like,
Yep.
Or discovering it.

308
00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:05.090
She gets a thrill out of doing it.
I can see it actually,

309
00:20:05.091 --> 00:20:07.040
now that I know you explained it that way,

310
00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:11.750
I could see myself doing that and getting,
wait,
that's not supposed to know.

311
00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:12.300
Well,

312
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:17.300
because it's sneaky and now that she knows they're on her escalate and you have

313
00:20:17.511 --> 00:20:21.320
to now it's a real challenge.
Like,
no,
she's,
she knows she's doing a naughty,

314
00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.230
bad and dirty thing.
Yeah,

315
00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:28.460
she's breaking the law and it's just a matter of time before they catch her

316
00:20:28.461 --> 00:20:32.360
though.
It is.
I mean there's going to wait for her or can they just wait for her?

317
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:34.700
Oh yeah.
She definitely,

318
00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:37.760
any buck people that watch this in that community.

319
00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:39.890
I'm sure they probably have pegged her by now,
I'm sure.

320
00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.760
What's the penalty for shitting in front of?
Well,
they're going to,

321
00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.940
they're going to Trump up some charges.
Well,
the charge

322
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.710
<v 0>public indecency.
Me Probably.</v>

323
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.240
<v 4>Yeah.
That's disgusting.
Bottom line is this discussed really,</v>

324
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.750
officers have asked Cathy to snap some pictures of the runner and get the word

325
00:20:58.751 --> 00:21:02.980
out hoping she was stopped before.
Indecent exposure with deprecation charges.

326
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:07.090
Public deprecation,
not a natural thing we would do in our society.

327
00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:12.380
It is drop your trouser and relieve yourself when you know there's people

328
00:21:13.751 --> 00:21:18.270
around,
especially like to be more natural with my name.
I'm thinking shit.

329
00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.290
Then taking a shit on your face,
Kathy,

330
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:24.790
you let me know she's had other people come forward and say that they have the

331
00:21:24.791 --> 00:21:26.110
same thing happening to them.

332
00:21:26.111 --> 00:21:29.770
They've seen that woman relief herself outside of a Walgreens and in people's

333
00:21:29.771 --> 00:21:31.870
back yards.
Know who she is.

334
00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.180
Police would love to hear from you and you sell it back to you.

335
00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:38.620
<v 0>It's clearly a thing now.
Yeah,
she's,
she's done it in front of Walgreens.</v>

336
00:21:38.621 --> 00:21:43.290
They get shits,
man.
I mean,
that's her thing.
Let her do it.
Oh,

337
00:21:43.291 --> 00:21:46.620
the big deal is,
uh,
no,
she's,
that's foul man.

338
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:50.720
And she's shitting in front of people's kids.
Like you're fucking nasty as hell.

339
00:21:50.721 --> 00:21:54.540
It's disgusting.
So disgusting.
I don't know.

340
00:21:54.541 --> 00:21:57.870
There's worse crimes in society here.
I was definitely worse crimes,

341
00:21:57.871 --> 00:22:02.520
but like human shit is so early and it's harsh.

342
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:07.020
She's taking a runner's shit.
It's,
that's so funny.

343
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.560
You know how many of my friends sent this to me,
by the way?
Yeah.

344
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:14.400
Like all of them.
Yeah.
They know.
They know what the show's about,
man.

345
00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.210
They know what it's about.
This is so gross.

346
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.810
This is so grow,
grow.

347
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:26.070
I like when they use the dynamat paper,
the technical word,
when you're like,

348
00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:30.900
this woman is defecating and I guarantee you a lot of the people listening don't

349
00:22:30.901 --> 00:22:34.490
know the word defecating.
Yeah.
Defecating isn't,

350
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:39.500
Americans would never guarantee a lot of them don't know slaves taking a shit

351
00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.760
and for your fucking house,
Bro.
Have you heard that?

352
00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.890
Um,
that I'm crazy.
He from Bill Burr.
Yeah.

353
00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:54.840
Yes.
I've heard the rumor mill and a rumor.
What do you feel about it?

354
00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:59.070
Of course.
What have I been making fun of you for?
For forever.

355
00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.380
That laughing one that I shouldn't laugh.
Right?

356
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.710
Which means that you on some level it resonates with you.

357
00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.960
What do you think of the wrong evil?
Okay.

358
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:09.670
<v 4>Boy,
you're really quiet.
Sometimes when you stand next to him,</v>

359
00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:12.490
I just paid her into his head sometimes like what's going on in there?

360
00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:15.040
And if you're a psycho,
you've,
you spot another cycle.
And it's just like,

361
00:23:15.041 --> 00:23:18.790
this is a fucking movie going on there that I would love to finance.

362
00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:23.200
You almost hospitalized me one time from laughing so hard.
Like,

363
00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:27.820
I don't know if you remember,
this is 20 people for the first show and as a girl,

364
00:23:27.821 --> 00:23:31.220
Joe Rogan,
that's a 12 with a guy that's a fault.

365
00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.370
Said you're very beautiful.

366
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:37.990
And then she just went and ran with it and started talking to my husband.

367
00:23:37.991 --> 00:23:42.010
Pimps are out.
No fights for 20 bucks.

368
00:23:42.011 --> 00:23:44.560
You could fucking with the back of the room twice,
right?
I don't know.

369
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.150
This girl is beautiful and this we thought is just

370
00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:54.170
showing between shows.
I talking to them about what's going on.
Oh my God,

371
00:23:54.171 --> 00:23:58.310
I had such a great thought.
I think it was that stuff.
True.
As she goes.
Yeah.

372
00:23:58.311 --> 00:24:02.360
I go show me the monkey in the woman's bathroom.
Pull down the pants.

373
00:24:02.361 --> 00:24:06.650
The girl had a monkey that was spotless.
It nearly stunk.
I ate it.

374
00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.070
I framed it up some and then she sucked my Dick.
That was it.

375
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:13.400
I went back to my room.
I didn't think nothing of it.
I'm like,
Jesus Christ.

376
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:18.250
She starts going,
no,
I suck.
The Canadians.
[inaudible] was like,

377
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.080
what are you talking about?
And she's like,
I suck this Dick.

378
00:24:21.081 --> 00:24:23.850
And he kicked her by mouth.
He's like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

379
00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:29.390
The cops had to hold them back.
Lisa,
I want my $40 that's all he wanted.

380
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:34.520
<v 2>Jesus,
you think that's crazy?</v>

381
00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:40.610
<v 4>You're right.
The biggest bug is like shit.</v>

382
00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:46.260
<v 2>I side with Joe and bill on this one.
You're out of your fucking mind.</v>

383
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:48.720
Blue Band made that so props to blue band.
Wait,

384
00:24:48.721 --> 00:24:51.180
what part of that story was funny for all of it?

385
00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:56.490
The part that the woman's husband,
prostitutes or already to comics.
So funny.

386
00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:59.250
Why are we no,
really,
I'm serious.
Why is it funny to you?

387
00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:01.530
Like what part is the giggle?

388
00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.980
It's like you're asking me like I feel like you're asking me what part isn't

389
00:25:04.981 --> 00:25:08.520
funny.
Okay,
so that I don't know where to start.
What part is funny meal?

390
00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:11.760
The whole thing.
Everything is funny about it.
It's funny the way he tells it.

391
00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:15.390
It's funny that that that happened,

392
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:20.520
that that's a reality somewhere.
All of it's funny.
Okay.
That's funny story.

393
00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:24.680
So don't you like funny stories?
I do.
I just don't.
I don't think that,

394
00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.770
I think it's sad.
And what part of it's sad.
Bummed out for the girl.
Honestly.

395
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:33.520
She liked doing it.
Did she?
Yeah,
she was.
He was all about it.
That's what he said.

396
00:25:33.521 --> 00:25:38.521
Why don't you cry at the end that she cried when she stuck around for the second

397
00:25:38.701 --> 00:25:41.110
show and then he started,
um,

398
00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:44.070
she realized like it Kinda hit her,

399
00:25:44.071 --> 00:25:48.450
I guess when the drugs wore off or something and then she started crying.

400
00:25:48.451 --> 00:25:53.100
But like,
it's funny that somebody would start crying and saying,

401
00:25:53.101 --> 00:25:56.430
I suck that guy's Dick in a show.
I would laugh at that.
When you laugh at that,

402
00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:00.480
like she just did it.
She volunteered to do it.
You wouldn't laugh at that.

403
00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:04.350
Can you bring this up in therapy?
What about it?
Just bring it up.

404
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:09.750
You need to work on it.
I think it's,
you don't think it's funny?

405
00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:14.460
No.
Why not?
Because it just isn't,
it's just not,
it's not like,

406
00:26:14.461 --> 00:26:18.540
it's not on my radar is humorous.
It's like a story where I'm like,
sad.

407
00:26:18.541 --> 00:26:20.070
I feel bad for that lady.
I laughed.

408
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.160
That's half as hard as I laughed the first time he told me that the first time

409
00:26:23.161 --> 00:26:27.270
he told me that I seriously could have used an oxygen tank.
Okay.

410
00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.750
I laughed so hard,
just like I left it,

411
00:26:30.751 --> 00:26:35.520
that Wu Tang story about when they were sentenced by bill thinks you're a
psycho.

412
00:26:35.521 --> 00:26:38.610
It didn't it start there.
Well,
I told him that story.
He did not,
he didn't laugh.

413
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.980
Yeah,
because bill and I have what's known as empathy.

414
00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:43.680
You always say that bullshit.
Okay.

415
00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:53.390
<v 0>He's actually a really,
uh,
you know,
sweet guy.
I'm not like a tender,</v>

416
00:26:53.391 --> 00:26:56.830
but I'm not as we got cuddle bear.
You know,
you,
you are too.

417
00:26:56.831 --> 00:27:00.910
But I do feel like you have these dark demons inside that you're not really

418
00:27:00.911 --> 00:27:05.350
letting on,
but what do you mean the rage inside?
No,
and stuff like that.

419
00:27:05.351 --> 00:27:09.560
I laugh at things that are inappropriate,
you know,
that I know as do I,
yeah.

420
00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:13.560
Mental illness makes me laugh a lot.
Right.
I think that's,

421
00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:15.190
that stuff's real funny.
You think that,

422
00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:19.390
that there's no suitable critique of that quality.

423
00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:22.870
It's just not as sadistic as like suffering.

424
00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.090
Like what you're laughing at is that this woman,

425
00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:29.010
I'm not even in the,
the story in your arm.

426
00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:35.510
That's the difference is like I'm,

427
00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.820
I'm basically laughing at like the guy with Tourette's because that's a silly

428
00:27:38.821 --> 00:27:43.260
byproduct of mental illness and I was a little bit of a neurological disorder.

429
00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:46.320
Um,
things that schizophrenia,
people say.

430
00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:50.110
It's funny to me because it's just a byproduct of,
of mental illness.
But yeah,

431
00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.090
you're laughing at true suffering.

432
00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.760
The suffering that gives you the tickle.
Yeah.

433
00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:59.580
Like this woman was drugged and then her husband pimps are out and then she gets

434
00:27:59.581 --> 00:28:00.450
with Joey Diaz.

435
00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:08.630
Okay.
And then during the shows,
shouts it out that I suck,
that guys dig in.

436
00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:11.130
And what does her husband do to her?
He wants his $40.

437
00:28:11.131 --> 00:28:14.940
He's not mad that she sucked his dick.
He's mad that he hasn't been paid.
Okay.

438
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:19.080
Yeah.
So the depravity.
Yeah.
I mean I,
I don't,

439
00:28:19.081 --> 00:28:21.810
I can't believe I would have to explain what's funny.
I actually,

440
00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:24.120
and I'm being like,
this isn't a steak or anything.

441
00:28:24.121 --> 00:28:27.040
Like I genuinely don't know what's funny.
You know,

442
00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:30.900
like it's sad and to pray for me.
It's sad that somebody says,

443
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.830
I don't know what's funny.
That's what said,
I'm serious.
I'm,
I'm,

444
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:36.750
I am either humor,

445
00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:41.410
I am so serious when I say it's sad to me that somebody is like,
I don't know.

446
00:28:41.411 --> 00:28:43.770
Understand what's funny about that.
That's what's sad to me.

447
00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:52.200
Cause even in Henry Portrait of a serial killer,
yeah,
I do get it.

448
00:28:52.201 --> 00:28:53.610
Like he snaps the hookers.
Huh?

449
00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:54.543
<v 4>Ah Ha.</v>

450
00:28:56.670 --> 00:29:00.660
<v 0>Okay.
Yeah.
And then the guy looks back and goes,
yeah.
That,</v>

451
00:29:00.661 --> 00:29:05.160
that look is funny.
It's the look that's funny to that crazy thing happening.

452
00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:08.610
But I get the feeling that you're laughing at the hookers neck being snapped in

453
00:29:08.611 --> 00:29:12.030
the first class.
I know it's the reaction.

454
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.940
We actually say it's the reaction,
the reaction.

455
00:29:14.941 --> 00:29:19.940
And it's also that it's also that like,
um,
what's funny about that?
It's,

456
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:23.430
it'd be like if somebody was like,
hey,
these people need to shut up.

457
00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:26.340
And then one of them goes and snaps her neck and you're like,

458
00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:30.040
I didn't mean like that.
Right.
Like it's like one of those things,
you know,

459
00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:34.450
like that is,
it's an extreme,
it's an extreme reaction to it.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

460
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:38.730
Okay.
But then I see it.
Then I feel empathy for the person who just got killed.

461
00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.150
That's where I was not real.
It's a fucking movie.
You know.
What about the,

462
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.650
the Asian man that got his legs crashed

463
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:47.830
and he was screaming for help.

464
00:29:47.831 --> 00:29:50.980
And a lot of people agree with me that that was hilarious.
A lot.

465
00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:56.170
What was funny about,
about it that time that I'm,
what am I missing?
Oh my God.

466
00:29:56.171 --> 00:29:57.130
Again,
it's like,

467
00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.630
I feel like I'm explaining what's funny to my mom or something right now.

468
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:04.780
It's like,
I mean the look,
the sound,

469
00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:07.120
the fact that the car kept coming back up,

470
00:30:07.121 --> 00:30:11.640
the engines revving the guys.
Yeah.

471
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:16.150
You would know how to say words.
He's yelling and so much pain.

472
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:21.580
You got to bring this up.
What am I supposed to say?

473
00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.610
Just,
I don't know dude.
Just explain this to him.
Yeah,

474
00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:28.750
I'll be like a,
hey,

475
00:30:28.751 --> 00:30:32.620
I want to talk to you about something that I laugh when super funny things

476
00:30:32.621 --> 00:30:36.190
happen and um,
I don't understand why it's not super funny things.

477
00:30:36.191 --> 00:30:39.370
It's super violent things,
silver,
inappropriately,

478
00:30:39.371 --> 00:30:42.100
violent things that heart heart people.
I just think too,

479
00:30:42.101 --> 00:30:44.920
like it's a little suspect.
You're just love of murder.

480
00:30:44.921 --> 00:30:49.090
And like last night we'd watch a great movie together.

481
00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:53.740
Baby driver.
Yeah.
Fantastic.
Silly title.
Great movie.
Great movie.

482
00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.980
And I'm like,
okay,
good night sweetie,
I love you.
I give you a kiss goodnight.

483
00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:01.750
And then I just hear my bed,
think stab,
stab,
stab,
kill.

484
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:04.860
I'm like,
what the fuck?
Can't fall asleep to this dude.
And you know,

485
00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:08.100
and it's like another angry murder kill.
But I mean,

486
00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:11.440
here's what's funny is nobody would listen to us and be like,
oh my God.

487
00:31:11.441 --> 00:31:13.840
Like what kinds of thing are you watching?
Oh,

488
00:31:13.841 --> 00:31:17.460
it's this little known series called Narcos on Netflix.
Okay.

489
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:22.180
So if it's not narcos,
it's usually like,
and the victim was a blonde woman,

490
00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:25.750
a 41 year old mother of one son named Ellis.

491
00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:30.880
They lived in a suburb of California.
Yeah.
And then,
you know,

492
00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.580
I gotta hear that stuff in the background.
What are you saying?

493
00:31:33.581 --> 00:31:38.080
I'm going to murder you.
I didn't say you just did.

494
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:41.280
Is that what you're,
but that's what your fear is.
Feels like it.
Why?

495
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:42.410
Cause I watch shows.
No,

496
00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:47.110
it feels like you do have some kind of repressed anger that's expressing itself

497
00:31:47.111 --> 00:31:49.330
through your choice of humor and entertainment.

498
00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:54.350
Like I have to tell you that I don't watch murder shows is free.

499
00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:58.810
I don't,
I just never do not interested.
Not Interested,

500
00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:02.470
because you're not the only,
like my mother's a type to go like,
Oh,

501
00:32:02.471 --> 00:32:06.010
you just love these murder shows and then you have to go like,
Hey,

502
00:32:06.011 --> 00:32:10.090
do you think that this murder show was made?
And they're just like,
I hope,

503
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:14.160
I hope just one guy watches it.
I mean,
you realize that millions of people watch,

504
00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:16.730
okay.
Millions of people have mental problems and ideal

505
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:21.490
people also like these white bomber movies and medical dramas.

506
00:32:21.491 --> 00:32:25.090
I don't like medical dramas.
Don't want to watch people with cancer.
Yeah,
no,

507
00:32:25.091 --> 00:32:29.230
I'm the same way.
Fuck that.
So am I.
But I think that every night,

508
00:32:29.231 --> 00:32:32.890
I mean it's okay.
It's like,
it's the same thing all the time.

509
00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:36.130
Every night it's murder,
murder,
murder,
kill account account,

510
00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.830
confessions of murders,
murders.

511
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:42.380
<v 2>I like it.
It's entertaining.
Okay.</v>

512
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:47.810
I would like to watch those shows or shows of people screaming cause they,

513
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:50.750
you know,
got hit by something or yeah,

514
00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.890
I told you about that time I left uncontrolled Lena guys face when he told me a

515
00:32:54.891 --> 00:32:58.670
bath tub was dropped on him.
Right.
I know they've heard it before.

516
00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:00.950
I think I'm laughing that hard,
honestly,

517
00:33:00.951 --> 00:33:05.951
if I were really break it down because it's so terrifying.

518
00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:10.240
Maybe to me on a,
you know what I mean?
Like murder and these horrible

519
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:14.420
murder I'm talking about,
like when I laugh really hard,

520
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:19.900
it's so extreme to my psyche and I kind of fear it in such a way that it's how I

521
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:23.810
process what's going on.
In other words,

522
00:33:23.811 --> 00:33:28.430
like when that guy told me that the bathtub was dropped on him and he was really

523
00:33:28.431 --> 00:33:32.870
sincere and like told me what it did to him,
I think it wasn't like,
Oh,

524
00:33:32.871 --> 00:33:34.520
I'm laughing at your misfortune.

525
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:39.560
It was like I couldn't look at him and process what was going on.

526
00:33:39.561 --> 00:33:43.700
So I,
I had to laugh,
you know,
like I laughed to deal with it.

527
00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:47.780
You know,
it's like laughing when you,
when you shouldn't laugh.
Yeah.

528
00:33:47.781 --> 00:33:49.760
You can't handle the actual feelings about it.

529
00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:53.080
I think I can't handle the actual feelings about even go there.
Oh,

530
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:57.320
that's what's happening.
Yeah.
Huh.
Yeah.

531
00:33:57.350 --> 00:34:00.470
But that joy [inaudible] story is just funny.
That's just a funny story.

532
00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:07.250
What inspired you to put this together within the Dov?
Oh,

533
00:34:07.251 --> 00:34:09.110
I just thought it was funny that,
uh,

534
00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:12.730
that I laughed really hard during that thing and that Joe was like,
uh,

535
00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:18.650
now did Joe say anything at your ridiculous amount of laughter?
No.

536
00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.420
I actually asked them afterwards I go,

537
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:25.670
I was laughing so hard at that and I looked at you and I saw you like with that

538
00:34:25.671 --> 00:34:30.470
expression,
you're like,
I thought that you,
you know,
he was like,
oh,

539
00:34:30.471 --> 00:34:34.940
I didn't,
I don't remember.
Like we were all smoking and drinking.
Sure.

540
00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:40.040
He's like,
I'm going to remember that tissue,
please.
Yeah.
Well,

541
00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.990
but I mean,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I thought it was fun

542
00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:45.420
<v 5>to put that together.</v>

543
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:52.280
<v 2>I don't know.
No.</v>

544
00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:54.600
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

545
00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:59.170
<v 2>Do you think I need help?
Please?
If you need help,</v>

546
00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.250
I get help.
I go everywhere.

547
00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:06.680
<v 5>Having a flashback of a beautiful detail snow removal off I did,
uh,</v>

548
00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:11.140
just north of here at a plateau last year.
I'll elevate it up like that.

549
00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:16.230
Hey,
that fucker greeter has a plow in the front.
Wow.
That's fucking rare.
Yeah,

550
00:35:16.231 --> 00:35:17.064
buddy.

551
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:21.500
<v 6>That's fucking rare.
I'll look it up.</v>

552
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:26.010
<v 2>It's a snow plow dad boner.
Like you see how excited he got about that?</v>

553
00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.670
God's snow looks terrible.
Videoing a snow plow and he's like,
oh my God.

554
00:35:29.671 --> 00:35:31.890
It has that feature that's fucking rare.

555
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:38.100
<v 6>Oh my God.
I think that's an old fucking</v>

556
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.670
<v 5>Freightliner FLD from uh,
from the 90s.</v>

557
00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.430
Not a lot of those left around here.
It's running.

558
00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.313
<v 0>I mean,</v>

559
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:48.720
<v 5>oh yeah,
man.
There's my tongue nail right there.</v>

560
00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:51.960
Beautiful fucking Freightliner Murray.
Even,

561
00:35:51.961 --> 00:35:55.630
I think I filmed that truck before in Saint Henry.
Oh,
he films it regularly,

562
00:35:56.490 --> 00:36:01.050
right on.
Yeah,
man,
man,
look at it sleeper on that.

563
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:06.450
That's a big rig man.
This guy's accent

564
00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:11.540
<v 0>from master of accents.
It's,
this was filmed in Montreal.
Oh yeah.</v>

565
00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:12.260
Yeah.

566
00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:15.470
<v 5>You know that baby wasn't made after 2009.
It sounds too good.</v>

567
00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:22.300
<v 0>It is fucking snow plowing.
Yeah.</v>

568
00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:25.820
I mean this is definitely on the dad boner.
Sure.

569
00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:29.730
Everybody has something you love killing and depravity and this guy likes snow

570
00:36:29.731 --> 00:36:30.564
plows,
so,

571
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:31.623
<v 7>okay,</v>

572
00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:37.250
<v 5>well I'll tell you something guys.
This is definitely at first man.
Oh yeah.</v>

573
00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:38.301
I mean really,

574
00:36:38.301 --> 00:36:42.680
I got the same team here to same company clearing the snow on this tree here,

575
00:36:42.681 --> 00:36:46.760
which I don't remember what the hell it's called and they just did that side and

576
00:36:46.761 --> 00:36:50.210
I got to do it again cause there was so much snow.
That's fucking weird.

577
00:36:50.211 --> 00:36:53.960
It's actually two teams.
See,
look,
there's,
there's the other one is right there.

578
00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:55.570
<v 0>Super stoked about being,</v>

579
00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:59.590
his level of passion for snow plan is unlike so weird.

580
00:36:59.591 --> 00:37:02.320
You kind of respect it though,
right?
You're like,
you really love this shit.

581
00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:06.550
I mean everyone gets excited about something.
Yeah.
Like this is a,

582
00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.670
I'm just marveling at the amount of snow that looks terrifying.
Yeah.
Yup.

583
00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:15.230
Do you feel claustrophobic when snow falls like that?
Claustrophobic.
Yeah.
Like,

584
00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:19.120
cause I didn't grow up in that.
Like do you feel,
I kind of feel claustrophobic.

585
00:37:19.121 --> 00:37:22.930
Like it's,
I'm trapped inside.
Oh No,
no,
no.
You don't feel like,
oh my God,

586
00:37:22.931 --> 00:37:27.760
the snow's going to take over.
It's no,
no,
no.
I kinda like it.
Yeah.

587
00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:31.000
Yeah.
What,
what's the fun part?
Like,
what do you like?
I mean,

588
00:37:31.001 --> 00:37:33.430
I don't experience it that more much anymore.
So it's a,

589
00:37:33.431 --> 00:37:37.930
it's kind of a thrill and you know,
usually it's snowing,

590
00:37:37.931 --> 00:37:40.840
I'm in a hotel or something.
I'm like,
oh,
I mean it looks beautiful,

591
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:43.120
cozy and stuff.
I like it.
I like it.
Yeah.

592
00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:47.040
I like the great thing about like extremes of weather.
Well,

593
00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:50.800
you don't live in it is that I only experienced it for like 24 hours or

594
00:37:50.801 --> 00:37:54.520
something.
Yeah.
Do you feel like not doing anything in that weather though?
Yes.

595
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:58.390
That's a thing.
Yes.
I had weighed 200 pounds just cause I'd be like,
well,

596
00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:03.240
I'm gonna make some potato soup.
Oh yeah.
That happens.
Yeah.

597
00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.140
I don't want to go.

598
00:38:05.141 --> 00:38:09.070
Why would you want to do is deuces out in Utah where it snows?
Yeah,
of course.

599
00:38:09.071 --> 00:38:13.520
I would just order Postmates and like cozy up and watch some movies.
Yeah,
man.

600
00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:18.430
Right.
Here's,
uh,
here's some,
some emails that came in.
I had to do.

601
00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:20.890
Um,
we have a cell on my translation,
by the way.

602
00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.570
Do Blind people save on electricity?

603
00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:25.600
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

604
00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:29.180
<v 0>Hi.
Brilliant thought.
Provoker that's a good one.
So smart.</v>

605
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.630
I had a thought while I was rub,
rub,
rubbing myself to sleep.

606
00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:36.040
Do you think that blind people will save a shit ton of money?
Electricity?
See

607
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.280
<v 2>you and peanuts and December,
Tom,
Armando,
Armando,</v>

608
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:43.810
I've never considered that.
But as soon as that thought hits your mind,

609
00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:49.330
it's obviously you're like,
oh,
that makes total sense.
It's a silly question.

610
00:38:49.331 --> 00:38:53.590
But then not because you're like,
well,
well they have to run like the standards.

611
00:38:53.591 --> 00:38:58.120
You're heating or cooling your appliances,
but they don't turn the lights on.

612
00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:00.850
At least I don't have to,
they don't have to write.
I mean,

613
00:39:00.851 --> 00:39:02.260
depends on your level of blindness.

614
00:39:02.261 --> 00:39:05.470
I've talked to some blind people that told me that,
you know,
there's,

615
00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:08.490
there's levels obviously of blindness.
So there's,

616
00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:13.330
there's people that actually are seeing shades and shapes and therefore like,

617
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:17.800
you know,
they sense light coming in that can effect,
you know,

618
00:39:17.801 --> 00:39:22.000
where they see what their limited sight sees.
Of course.
Yeah.

619
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:25.990
And there's people that are totally 100% blind and I turned the lights on just

620
00:39:25.991 --> 00:39:30.640
to prevent like burglars from assuming nobody's home.
Oh,
right,
right.

621
00:39:30.641 --> 00:39:34.840
And that's just a safety measure and turn them on.
Well,
if thrilling question,
uh,

622
00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:39.550
blind people,
let us know.
Yeah,
that's a really good one.
Do you want to hear,

623
00:39:39.551 --> 00:39:44.190
I got a translation for so amazing.
Oh my God.
A Salamay.
Uh,

624
00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:47.410
just to remind people had not left the,
uh,

625
00:39:47.411 --> 00:39:51.610
or the message is for Sallie Mae had not been left in a long time.

626
00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.280
And then,
um,

627
00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.990
last week at a nowhere it happened again.

628
00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.920
<v 0>I know.
And,
and months,
months,</v>

629
00:40:00.921 --> 00:40:04.850
almost a year had gone by is that long since we moved here,

630
00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:08.720
which was November of last year.
And we're almost in November,

631
00:40:08.721 --> 00:40:11.780
so a little bit less than a year.
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

632
00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:16.280
And I was so excited to hear it again.
I was just,
okay,
so,
so what did,

633
00:40:16.281 --> 00:40:20.150
what was said?
So this guy writes in,
hi,
my name is [inaudible] from Los Gatos,

634
00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:24.680
California.
Woo Woo blows.
God owes big fan of the show.

635
00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:27.080
Translating what the uranium woman's said on your show.

636
00:40:27.081 --> 00:40:32.081
Basically she's saying that you need to contact the termite company and for $450

637
00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:37.340
they will come and treat your area and then she said put something white down on

638
00:40:37.341 --> 00:40:40.330
the floors and they will find the termites.
That's pretty much it.

639
00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:44.850
<v 8>[inaudible] my name Jackson.</v>

640
00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:49.440
Why don't talk you down from Ima,
Timbo Cain book all Jacky Tran my day,

641
00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:51.880
which was how the time they will do though.

642
00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:56.640
<v 2>My favorite part about the old Sallie Mae voicemails,
there was this guy,</v>

643
00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.780
they would translate a lot of them.
He told me,
he's like,
man,

644
00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:04.810
it is so inappropriate for a woman that is obviously an older woman to talk.

645
00:41:05.361 --> 00:41:08.270
The way she talks,
she's got her so he's like,
he's so vulgar.

646
00:41:08.271 --> 00:41:13.090
She's saying things that like street guys say there's mother fuckers Salloway

647
00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:16.070
yeah,
she talked a lot of Shit,
man.
She used to say that.

648
00:41:16.071 --> 00:41:19.250
He's always giving a Salamay advice.
He's like,
you know,

649
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:24.230
put the put bags on the fruit tree is,
and you need to do this and this medicine,

650
00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:27.710
pick it up from here.
Costs a lot.
And it must be a mother.

651
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:33.110
<v 0>It must be a mother onto grandmother.
Some maternal figure in Salamis.</v>

652
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:38.440
God,
this mystery.
I really wish we could find Salamat no.

653
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:40.790
Define Solomon.
Listen,
Persian community.

654
00:41:40.791 --> 00:41:45.500
Can you please do some Intel like fucking ask people like there's obviously an

655
00:41:45.501 --> 00:41:47.000
La Persian.
These are,

656
00:41:47.001 --> 00:41:52.001
this is the number I believe in eight one eight Oh oh three went out asking the

657
00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:57.470
La Community.
Find that blonde.
Amanda.
Let her know.
Well,

658
00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:00.020
here's the thing,
you think that that's crazy.

659
00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:02.240
But immigrant communities like in La,

660
00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:05.480
there's a finite number of Hungarians in Los Angeles.

661
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:10.460
And if I talked to one Hong Go,
I'll be like,
hey,
do you know,
uh,
this guy auto?

662
00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:13.950
He earns us the store in Burbank.
Yeah.
Well auto has got this daughter so and so.

663
00:42:13.951 --> 00:42:18.170
Do you know her?
Yeah,
actually I do.
You can actually track it down.

664
00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.540
Just like you found the kid,
the bikes kid,

665
00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:26.180
you never know because of the interwebs.
So need detectives

666
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:34.040
detectives to get together and solve the Solomon.
Yeah,

667
00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:38.360
somebody knows Salamay there's six degrees of separation here.

668
00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:43.030
Absolutely true.
The world is much smaller now because of the interwebs course.

669
00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:45.140
Salamay

670
00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:47.870
<v 2>I love it,
man.
So wait,</v>

671
00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:51.490
anything else anymore that we missed from that or no emails?
No,
no,
no.
I'm saying

672
00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:55.750
that's it.
And he's like,
basically that's,
that's what's going on.

673
00:42:56.950 --> 00:43:01.330
An email that came in on your Sydney's.
Hey guys,

674
00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:06.340
it's Friday,
September 15th,
after countless hours,
long sleepless nights,

675
00:43:06.341 --> 00:43:09.130
extreme night terrors,
keeping me from having a decent family life.

676
00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:13.960
I would like to address the research I've been doing on Tina's sneeze.

677
00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:14.883
Um,

678
00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.480
if you listen very closely,

679
00:43:19.481 --> 00:43:23.230
she's saying Jadah as she sneezes.

680
00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:28.890
My theory on this cause is after being told many times that when I was younger

681
00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:32.860
by my elders,
sneezing feels so good because you're getting all the bad out.

682
00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:36.340
Then after hearing of genes,
longtime hatred of Jadah,
Pinkett Smith,

683
00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:40.960
I've kind of the conclusion that much like a high number,
sloppy brown,

684
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:44.800
she couldn't control letting out what was to be a cry out of epic proportions.

685
00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:48.460
He was obviously hurting inside and extruded jade,

686
00:43:48.461 --> 00:43:51.940
his name and a last ditch effort to keep the demons out of her mind and off her

687
00:43:51.941 --> 00:43:55.090
back.
I hope this helps and I hope I can get some sleep now.

688
00:43:55.091 --> 00:43:58.090
It's been a rough month.
I was like,
couldn't get the sound out of my head.

689
00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:02.800
Say High Tight and definitely stay non-binary and white.
Love Sky.

690
00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:08.000
And I don't know,
it
sounds kind of like your second trade.

691
00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:15.550
I don't hate,
I don't hate her.
Yeah.

692
00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:16.930
I think I feel like,

693
00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.500
I feel like she's in a marriage that is probably pretty wacky.

694
00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:24.480
And then they got a wacky thing going on.
She and um,
well he just,

695
00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:29.560
he slams everybody.
So what though?
And she's like,
well,
I'm Mrs. Smith.

696
00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:33.420
I'm Mrs. Wilson.
I mean,
who?
Who cares what,
who cares that he's doing that?

697
00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:37.950
So what I am not wired for that type of a marriage,
Tom.
Yeah,
I know.

698
00:44:37.951 --> 00:44:41.040
But you're also not married to fucking Wellsmith like think about being married

699
00:44:41.041 --> 00:44:45.000
to Willsmith.
I picture,
I picture myself married to will Smith and he's like,

700
00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:49.550
uh,
I just,
whatever slammed a bunch of hoes,
I'd be like,
yeah,
yeah.

701
00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:52.380
That's kind of what I signed up for it.
Your will Smith I guess.

702
00:44:52.381 --> 00:44:54.330
So that level of celebrity,

703
00:44:54.331 --> 00:44:58.500
you can't expect them to be international movie stars.
I mean,

704
00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:02.130
I don't know that that,
I mean,
I know he wasn't like a hardcore rapper,

705
00:45:02.131 --> 00:45:05.610
but he was a rapper.
It's like,
yeah,
of course,
man,
you're going to fuck.

706
00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:07.050
I guess that's the trade off.

707
00:45:07.051 --> 00:45:11.170
I mean there are a lot of rich wives that that's what,
that's the game,

708
00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:14.370
sign up for it.
That's the deal though.
Melania's of the world are like,
well,

709
00:45:14.371 --> 00:45:18.150
I ain't going to suck this fucking trolls Dick.
But I think they like handbags.

710
00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:22.200
They sign up when they go.
It's not a surprise.
Of course.
Of course.
You're,

711
00:45:22.201 --> 00:45:26.100
you're a hot piece of ass and yeah.
And he's a troll and he's got tons of,

712
00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:28.200
well he's not even a wheel.
Smith's hot.
Yeah.

713
00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:33.680
I don't know know what you're married.
I will be.
I couldn't,
I personally,
well,

714
00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:38.670
yeah.
No,
but I mean that's not what I signed up for.
I'm a buyer.

715
00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:42.580
We're in a bonded pair.
You and I were like a couple of Brussels,
no mannequin.
No,

716
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:47.700
I need my,
my knee,
my jeans.
Yeah.
Borrowing the parent when you're gone.
I'm,

717
00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:51.790
I'm just,
I don't like it.
I'm not good.
Um,
uh,

718
00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:53.363
let's see here.

719
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:08.070
I'm reading the Hay balers.

720
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:13.250
Have you guys ever wonder why old man flacid penises are always so big?
Yeah.

721
00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:17.600
She always walk around locker rooms,
Butt ass naked,
Dick Swaying back and forth.

722
00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:20.420
And you wonder,
is this because the more boners you get

723
00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:25.400
so much that as an old man you have a bigger flacid penis.

724
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.160
My wife think is just the gravity of 80 years of your dick hanging there.

725
00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:33.830
It makes it gradually bigger with age.
We need the help from the Dick Detectives,

726
00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:39.010
keep it high and tight.
The Cox,
the gators,
Eric and misty from Nebraska.

727
00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:41.330
Wow.
It's a really good question.

728
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:47.210
I have seen some big old sloppy decks in locker rooms and such,

729
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:50.480
but to be fair,
I've seen some small old Dick's too.
You know,

730
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:55.260
but I do know what he's talking about that it appears sloppier and sloppier and

731
00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:58.520
sloppier and sloppier.
Because I mean,
I think both,

732
00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.640
I don't think all the boners contribute to it,

733
00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:06.320
but I do think gravity considering contributes to it.
The boner.
Yeah.

734
00:47:06.321 --> 00:47:08.840
And some of them,
you know,
I mean,
some of them just have healthy hogs.

735
00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:12.260
They're just,
you know,
it's just like any portion of the population.

736
00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:15.540
But everything is sagging.
It's,
it's at your,
yeah.

737
00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:18.440
We know we're biological beings that break down over time.

738
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:22.810
And I do think it's like you,
what you said,
just loose moose skin.
Loose meets.

739
00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:26.690
Yeah.
Loose.
Everything.
Sags more,
everything.
My tits are a mass.

740
00:47:26.691 --> 00:47:30.160
Everything's a mess.
But I've seen the little,
I've seen little on old guys,

741
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:31.720
<v 0>little penis.
Yeah,
sure.</v>

742
00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:34.960
But even the skin doesn't get hanging on the little apartment.
Yeah.
The skin,

743
00:47:34.961 --> 00:47:37.650
we'll head on it,
but it's still little.
But like,
you know,

744
00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:41.080
it'll have like sloppy hang balls,
you know,

745
00:47:41.081 --> 00:47:42.760
like big sloppy walls.

746
00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:47.680
I think the balls are more effected than the Penis.
Uh,
for men,

747
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:50.080
male aging him.
If I'm not like I haven't seen,

748
00:47:50.081 --> 00:47:53.920
I haven't seen many old dicks and balls,
but on I've seen in,
you know,

749
00:47:53.921 --> 00:47:57.570
films or whatnot.
But I got to show you this,
uh,

750
00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:02.440
when I found a new star for you,
strong performers.
Wait,

751
00:48:02.441 --> 00:48:05.620
we have to watch this Rocco.
Suffredini I know.
Why don't we watch it?

752
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:07.410
We watch it tonight.
I'd love to.
Yeah.

753
00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:10.690
I saved it because I saw it when you're gone.
I'd definitely watch it,

754
00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:15.460
but I found out,
man,
she just see this guy.
What is it?
What's the story?

755
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:17.890
I just show it to you later and we can talk about it next week,

756
00:48:17.891 --> 00:48:20.690
but I find a new big Dick Dangler for you.
Oh Geez.

757
00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:23.200
Really given people the business too.

758
00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:25.183
<v 6>You're like it.</v>

759
00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:31.210
<v 0>I will.
Yeah,
I'll like it.
Or You like it?
No,
I definitely like it,</v>

760
00:48:31.211 --> 00:48:35.710
but I want to show it to you.
Okay.
Yeah.
He's a porno star.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh boy.

761
00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:38.790
I don't know if I need it in my life quite honestly.
I think you might be like,

762
00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:43.270
and you know,
that was so fucking cool.

763
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.400
God.
People watching on Youtube.
I don't even want to repeat what you just did,

764
00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:52.050
but people just listening to this show don't know how to,

765
00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:56.980
I'm not even going to repeat it.
A nasty.
Did your own porno man make a porno?
Girl

766
00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:02.980
saw hot.
So fun.
I love shooting

767
00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:10.443
fucked up.

768
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:19.080
It's so fucked up.
Do you think those girls are,
do you think there,

769
00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:21.850
there must be some girls have genuinely let love it,

770
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.000
love fucking bang whores and then there's some precedent telling themselves and

771
00:49:27.581 --> 00:49:30.970
then their girls are so high that they're like,
what do I have to say to do this?

772
00:49:30.971 --> 00:49:34.660
All of your theories are correct.
What do I have to say to make $150 today?

773
00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:36.060
All of your theories are right.
Oh,

774
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:39.970
you're going to sneeze and then you're going to go,
oh,
this needs filled so good.

775
00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:44.470
Ooh,
that was terrible.
That was terrible.

776
00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:47.980
Oh,
I can't believe I haven't brought this up.

777
00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:52.310
Yesterday you came home and,
uh,

778
00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:57.790
we ordered some Thai food and I had the Panang curry and you had your yellow

779
00:49:57.791 --> 00:49:58.624
curry.

780
00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.320
<v 6>Are you done?</v>

781
00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:07.540
<v 0>I think so.
You've got snot in your mustache.
I feel so good.
It doesn't feel good.</v>

782
00:50:07.541 --> 00:50:08.374
I feel good right now.

783
00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:13.910
I want to snooze more.
Really enjoy that.
Yeah.

784
00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:21.330
Really holding up the whole show now.
Tom just go.
Nobody wants to hear it.
Um,

785
00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:26.370
so we all had our curries and then like 15 minutes after you ate,

786
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:31.580
we were in the kids' playroom planning and Plato and you were like,
oh,

787
00:50:31.581 --> 00:50:34.040
I just farted.
No,
it wasn't good.
That was a hot,

788
00:50:34.041 --> 00:50:38.510
hot hot for it and it was real bad.
And then you went,

789
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:42.530
what is that?
What is that?
When you eat something?
Yeah,
let's talk about it.

790
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.920
And like within 10 minutes you can feel the water for them.

791
00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:50.420
It's not what you just ate,
it's what you ate previously.
That's my theory.
No,
no,

792
00:50:50.421 --> 00:50:55.070
no,
but old shit.
What's being pushed out.
But what you just ate is triggering.

793
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:56.720
It's triggering.
It's contributing.

794
00:50:56.721 --> 00:51:00.800
It's not spicy curry on top of something nasty that you had earlier.

795
00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:04.490
It's not a good formula,
man.
It really,
but,
and let's do some,

796
00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:07.690
let's do some detective work on,
I was terrified.

797
00:51:07.691 --> 00:51:12.130
Some shirt lock work were sitting in there with brown line in the playroom.

798
00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:16.650
Yeah,
and then I was like,
she lives in I,

799
00:51:16.651 --> 00:51:21.030
my eyes bugged out.
I was like,
oh wow.
Because of the smell I,

800
00:51:21.031 --> 00:51:25.760
because there was something there.
It was hot and I could feel my stomach going.

801
00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:32.570
I clinched and I was like,
oh my God.
I went in the toilet.

802
00:51:32.571 --> 00:51:37.280
It was like opening a faucet,
just a brown faucet.
Guatemalan Faucet.

803
00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:42.130
It was liquid.
It was really liquid hundred percent seven.
Yeah,

804
00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:47.030
and did it burn and that really,

805
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:50.220
that's what leads me to believe it's not what you just date.

806
00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:54.860
It's what you ate previously.
You're right.
You just can't come out that fast,

807
00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:58.430
but it's making you your,

808
00:51:58.431 --> 00:52:00.560
your digestive system to going like,
Whoa,

809
00:52:00.561 --> 00:52:04.400
we need to clear out this problem right now.
You took this morning,

810
00:52:04.401 --> 00:52:06.980
took you about 20 minutes.
I noticed it took a long time.

811
00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:09.920
It was more normal little,
a little more of a grind,
but more normal.

812
00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:14.180
I was probably smelly from the curry.
I didn't really register the smell.

813
00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:17.720
I can't remember.
It was,
what number was it?

814
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:22.030
This morning was probably a three s on bad.
No,

815
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:23.540
I was very small,

816
00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:27.530
which I'm surprised because I had poop soup when I came off the road and I had

817
00:52:27.531 --> 00:52:31.040
some curry last night or boy had had a diaper full of pellets when I woke up.

818
00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:34.350
When I pellets.
What does that mean?
Hard?
Oh,

819
00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:37.600
that was yesterday when I got him up from his nap.
They hard.
Oh,

820
00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:40.370
they were like little balls.
Oh,
he needs more fiber.

821
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:44.300
He won't eat vegetables to save his life right now.
No,
this morning's was better.

822
00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:48.260
Would it look like just more of a little slop?
Yeah,
that's normal.

823
00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:53.980
How do you get the toilet train the kid when they make like slops I mean is that

824
00:52:53.991 --> 00:52:55.760
because there's a diaper mushing?

825
00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:58.360
The person we're supposed to be getting into it right now,
by the way.
No,

826
00:52:58.370 --> 00:53:02.630
but how do you train somebody who's shit is like mush?

827
00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:04.550
It's like oatmeal.
Do you know what I mean?

828
00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:07.250
How do I train that and then we ain't got to clean up everything.

829
00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:11.510
I just don't understand because my browns don't look like that.
There's a,

830
00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:15.350
those are baby browns,
you know,
his stomach,
the intestines are still developing.

831
00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:21.530
I guess you just let them diarrhea and the
diarrhea.

832
00:53:21.531 --> 00:53:25.320
It's just not dire normal baby shit.
Yeah.
These have softer rounds,

833
00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:27.181
you know,

834
00:53:27.181 --> 00:53:30.660
it's great as we've been training him on the word dump a I've been saying,

835
00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:33.780
I have so excited about it's gotta take a dump.
You want to come with me?

836
00:53:33.781 --> 00:53:36.480
And then of course he wants to come and sit on my lap while I take a shit.

837
00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:40.770
But he likes to say Poopoo he likes poopoo cause it's easier to say,

838
00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:46.130
but I'm probably better for his life for like interacting with other children

839
00:53:46.201 --> 00:53:50.700
and like they adults that will be in those settings for him to say I can go

840
00:53:50.701 --> 00:53:55.580
poopoo yeah,
go.
Okay.
I dump
dump.

841
00:53:55.590 --> 00:53:59.340
No,
we even made the nanny laugh.
No,
our nanny is a pretty reserved,

842
00:53:59.510 --> 00:54:04.110
adorable Guatemalan lady and she's very proper.

843
00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:08.190
And we even made her laugh with the dump thing.
She started laughing.

844
00:54:08.191 --> 00:54:13.190
She knows that's not right.
She's like,
take a dump.
Um,

845
00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:18.090
uh,
check this out.
I think this might be,
is this in St Louis tits?

846
00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:22.530
Where is Saint Louis and is that in Mexico?
Is that where I'm going this week?

847
00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:26.670
Mexico.
St Louis,
Mexico,
Missouri.
Where is Saint Louis?

848
00:54:26.671 --> 00:54:31.370
I don't even know is again,
whereas Missouri,
it's not La Shit.

849
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:36.150
No.
Saint Louis is a no,
I know.
It's got the Arc de Triomphe,
the Arc de Triomphe,

850
00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:39.690
the Golden Arches.
They're called Golden Arches.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
No,

851
00:54:39.691 --> 00:54:41.910
that's Mcdonald's.
No.

852
00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:47.060
Now you got me telling people.
Can I see the Golden Arches?
Yeah.
Yeah.

853
00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:48.003
Saint Louis debts.

854
00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:53.180
When you get this Saint Louis is basically all dedicated to Mcdonald's pick.

855
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:56.900
I want to see the Golden Arches.
Yeah.
Was He Ronald McDonald?

856
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:59.530
This is where like the headquarters of,

857
00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:03.150
I watched the reg Ray Croft movie.
I know that that's not the case.

858
00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:07.080
It was really cool that you were texted me like I'm watching this movie about

859
00:55:07.081 --> 00:55:11.640
the Mcdonald's founder and he reminds me a lot of you,
he's such a piece of shit.

860
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:14.880
He's such a pos.
He's still some dude's wife.

861
00:55:14.881 --> 00:55:18.660
He rips off the original co founders and they think of me.
Well,

862
00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:22.020
he just looks like you act like you thinks like you.
That's all small stuff.

863
00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:25.760
<v 2>Uh,
check this out.
This is in Houston.</v>

864
00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:31.470
We have Houston pointed this out before about when people that you,

865
00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:36.230
that they don't fit the way they talk basically.

866
00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:37.820
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
And that's a new genre</v>

867
00:55:38.050 --> 00:55:42.150
<v 10>show.
I like it.
I'm more mid shows and yeah.
You know what I'm saying?</v>

868
00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:44.270
Good motherfucker right there.
Yep.

869
00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:48.440
<v 2>And you see it with,
you know,
there's certain that's a black guy talking.
No,</v>

870
00:55:48.441 --> 00:55:51.870
that's a white guy.
Oh,
right.
For the last week.
That's crazy.

871
00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:54.870
That's not from last week.
That's from like three years and years ago.

872
00:55:55.530 --> 00:55:58.170
But the pimp guy,
that's not a pimp,

873
00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:03.720
but it is a white guy who talks like a pimp.
Um,
but then there's,

874
00:56:03.721 --> 00:56:08.130
you know,
there's other people that you,
you know,
we've uh,
that like that,

875
00:56:08.131 --> 00:56:12.240
you know,
that girl who was like,
Oh,
you know,
um,
what was her name?

876
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:15.840
I forget her name,
but she,
this might be her,
right?

877
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:21.900
<v 0>Yeah.
She's like,
she's Asian,
right?
Yeah.
She's,</v>

878
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:24.280
she's like ghetto and like,
you're like,
what

879
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:28.750
<v 11>I see without them ally,
she's a bichon where I'm still cute.
Shit.</v>

880
00:56:28.751 --> 00:56:31.920
Get the fuck up Outta here.
I might live a little bit more taking time to talk.

881
00:56:32.130 --> 00:56:35.850
Don't get me fucked up,
bitch.
I'm still hurting.
She and we'll fuck yo a stop

882
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:38.160
<v 2>Asian.
Yeah,
that's wild,
right?</v>

883
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:42.870
Why you don't normally hear Asian chicks talking like that and then it obviously

884
00:56:42.871 --> 00:56:46.950
exists.
This is Ann Houston.
It's uh,

885
00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:50.250
it's like a little convenience store.

886
00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:53.670
The Asian dude is behind the counter.

887
00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:58.290
It looks like all the customers are black and he's talking mad shit to one of

888
00:56:58.291 --> 00:57:00.880
his customers.
So we don't know what's leading up to the shit talking.
But you,

889
00:57:00.881 --> 00:57:05.881
you get the feeling that the Asian guy is justified like that.

890
00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:09.030
The other guy has started something,
said something,

891
00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:14.010
but it's just wild to see an Asian dude.
I think like this.
Right?

892
00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:36.320
I mean that is crazy.
Not just like,

893
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:41.880
it's not that it's an Asian dude that is,
but like the,

894
00:57:41.881 --> 00:57:46.640
he talks like that.
What's your bitch ass going to do?
It comes around the corner,

895
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.620
gets in this dude's face.
Right?

896
00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:53.660
Doesn't that seem jarring when someone doesn't look like the accent that's

897
00:57:53.871 --> 00:57:57.470
coming down in their mouth?
I mean,
you talk like that.
It's not that.

898
00:57:57.471 --> 00:58:00.710
It's not possible,
but you're just like,
that's not good.
I am.

899
00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:03.770
I even talk about it to a much lesser degree,

900
00:58:03.771 --> 00:58:06.740
how people react to me when I speak Spanish and they're like,
oh,

901
00:58:06.741 --> 00:58:09.680
I didn't think you'd speak.
It's like a small thing where they're like,

902
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:12.110
I mean there's obviously people look like me who speak Spanish,

903
00:58:12.111 --> 00:58:14.690
but they still reacted like,
I just didn't expect that out of you.
You know?

904
00:58:15.090 --> 00:58:19.700
And it's like when you hear this do talk this way and he looks like this is

905
00:58:19.701 --> 00:58:21.070
crazy.
Yeah.
It's like stunning.

906
00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:26.140
<v 6>All right.</v>

907
00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:33.420
[inaudible] word.

908
00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:40.640
<v 2>I mean
that's oof man.
That is,</v>

909
00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:47.050
he's really part of the community.
If he can drop that shit,

910
00:58:47.051 --> 00:58:49.540
trick ass bitch.
What'd he say?
Like do shit.

911
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:51.343
<v 6>Yes,</v>

912
00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:55.290
<v 2>bitch ass and go and do a goddamn thing.</v>

913
00:58:57.780 --> 00:59:01.430
<v 6>This is an Asian guy.
That's an Asian dude.</v>

914
00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:03.840
Doesn't look aggressive at all.

915
00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:10.130
<v 2>Damn homie.
Maybe that's just what it's like to live in Houston.</v>

916
00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:12.770
You start talking like that,
I guess.
Have you ever,

917
00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:15.560
if you're around that all the time,
you would definitely pick it up.

918
00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:18.510
It'd be hilarious to find out his story.
That's what I want.

919
00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:22.610
I want to know like did you immigrate to this country and you showed up and you

920
00:59:22.611 --> 00:59:25.610
were like,
oh,
like try to figure out the culture and,

921
00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:29.330
and then you just were immersed in gas station,

922
00:59:29.331 --> 00:59:32.810
Houston culture and like that's you're like this is the world I grew up in.

923
00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:33.671
<v 0>Well definitely.</v>

924
00:59:33.671 --> 00:59:37.530
I mean if you hear English speakers like as second language and they pick that

925
00:59:37.531 --> 00:59:41.350
up,
they learn it like British English.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Then you're like,
wow,

926
00:59:41.351 --> 00:59:44.110
you talk all fancy.
Like you're from England,
right.
Native.

927
00:59:44.111 --> 00:59:46.360
But he sounds like a native English speaker.
Right?

928
00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:48.550
I don't think he sounds like no he's native,

929
00:59:48.551 --> 00:59:51.940
but he's native to Houston gas station.
But I'm saying if he,

930
00:59:51.941 --> 00:59:56.890
does this sound like you learned English after the underlying culturally from

931
00:59:56.891 --> 01:00:00.730
this gas station like this guys,
that'd be funny.

932
01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:02.550
Like where are you learning at this gas station?

933
01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:08.380
That's where I learned to talk to my parents.
My mother learned English,

934
01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:11.320
watching American television shows like sitcoms,

935
01:00:11.770 --> 01:00:15.100
like watching Sanford and son and I'm all in the family.

936
01:00:15.101 --> 01:00:19.120
So she knew like a lot of Sassy phrases and you're like,
wait,
how do you,

937
01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:21.540
how do you know,
like talk to the hand.
That's all right.

938
01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:25.750
<v 5>The spotlight.
You boys better.
No,</v>

939
01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.610
you just can't come in any kind of stone with that bullshit.

940
01:00:34.210 --> 01:00:37.910
<v 2>Again,
that Asian dude was counting someone who's like,</v>

941
01:00:37.911 --> 01:00:39.260
that motherfucker got me fucked up.

942
01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:44.600
Which is like real specific to be like for that to be part of your vernacular is

943
01:00:45.711 --> 01:00:48.700
pretty,
you know,
it's,
it's like you,

944
01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:53.330
you don't just like here a show once and start saying that that dude has been

945
01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:58.120
immersed in this for a long time.
There's Wildman that is,

946
01:00:58.430 --> 01:01:00.320
I could watch,
I would watch a,

947
01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:05.930
a camera lock into this gas station on her 24 hours.
I'll just be like,

948
01:01:05.931 --> 01:01:06.764
just keep playing there.

949
01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:11.200
<v 0>I give this guy a TV show instead of Kylie Jenner.</v>

950
01:01:11.201 --> 01:01:15.460
I watch this guy all day.
I mean,
that's some shit.
This dude,
like he got heated

951
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:19.770
right now.
It's a tough,
can

952
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:24.900
you imagine working at a gas station?
I mean,

953
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:28.480
it has to be such a dangerous job.
Uh,
you know,

954
01:01:28.481 --> 01:01:33.310
late at night and also people are just most of the time coming to get fucked up.

955
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:37.140
It's not like your people are like,
they might kind of get that book.
No,

956
01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:41.920
like let me get hostile cigars,
cigarettes,
liquor and beer,
liquor stores.

957
01:01:41.921 --> 01:01:44.980
I mean there's no such a dangerous job.

958
01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:48.210
I know at midnight on a Saturday night,
uh,

959
01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:51.370
scared walking into gas stations,

960
01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:55.260
<v 2>you're like,
fuck,
I need to,
I need to pay for his gas.</v>

961
01:01:55.261 --> 01:01:56.550
So I used to go to the bathroom and you're like,

962
01:01:56.551 --> 01:01:57.900
I need to get the fuck outta here.

963
01:01:58.030 --> 01:02:02.320
<v 0>I think it's a really bad idea that they sell alcohol at gas stations.</v>

964
01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:06.750
Like this is a place where you get in your car and drive.
I don't know,
it's just,

965
01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:10.320
it does attract a seedier element to these places.
It shouldn't be CD.

966
01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:13.150
Like why should a gas station be CD at all?
It shouldn't be,

967
01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:18.390
but they all are because of cigarettes and alcohol.
That's where you get it.
Yeah.

968
01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:19.470
No,
I,
there's,

969
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.950
<v 2>I pulled in the gas stations before and thought it was so shade.</v>

970
01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:26.790
I go drive to find another one in different states in the u s don't they

971
01:02:26.791 --> 01:02:28.380
separate that stuff out?

972
01:02:28.381 --> 01:02:31.620
Like I know you can't always buy alcohol and grocery stores like on the east

973
01:02:31.621 --> 01:02:34.480
coast.
Even in Colorado I think don't they have separate?
There's,

974
01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:37.590
there's state for stores,
differing laws for counties.

975
01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:41.100
So you could have a dry county and then the next county over you can buy
alcohol.

976
01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:45.090
Yeah.
I don't think they should still call it gas stations and I know,

977
01:02:45.110 --> 01:02:49.190
but it's big business like a lot of money.
They look a lot of money.

978
01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:53.670
Um,
what do you feel about,
I guess this is a question about this,

979
01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:56.010
eating it on the toilet.
As we all know,

980
01:02:56.011 --> 01:02:58.920
there's a pretty popular way mh page on Facebook.

981
01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:02.520
I've noticed recently there's a rise in mommy's thinking it's okay to literally

982
01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:06.000
eat where they shit.
I can't believe this is absolutely horrific.

983
01:03:06.001 --> 01:03:08.070
Trend is going unnoticed and widely accepted.

984
01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:10.620
Do you think it's okay to eat on the toilet?

985
01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:14.700
I personally believe it's the only way to get as fat as burnt Chrysler stay high

986
01:03:14.701 --> 01:03:18.330
and tight.
Mommy.
Tina will always be my main mommy.
If she was my mom,

987
01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:19.410
I would want to marry her.

988
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:24.390
Just like the gays Sariah or is that a funny way of saying Sarah,

989
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:29.630
what the fuck is that Sarah as a r y h a say Sarah Syria.

990
01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:36.270
Sharia.
Sharia,
uh,
eat on the toilet.
What do you think Jean?

991
01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:38.710
I did it when I was a little girl.
Um,

992
01:03:38.730 --> 01:03:43.440
I have a vivid memory of being constipated during dinner.

993
01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:44.191
Like I had to shit,

994
01:03:44.191 --> 01:03:47.880
but then I also had to eat and my mother bringing me a bowl of spaghetti to eat

995
01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:49.410
as I was shitting on the toilet.

996
01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:53.700
Fuck what I do it now as an adult now.
I mean,

997
01:03:53.701 --> 01:03:58.500
I accidentally walked in the bathroom with a mouthful of food yesterday and felt

998
01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:02.850
creepy like chewing what was in my mouth to sit down and pee.
That felt gross.

999
01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:07.200
I mean,
there's so much poo and I don't bring meals flakes onto the,

1000
01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:10.800
onto the toilet.
You know,
I have brought coffees in,
you know,

1001
01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:14.790
cause sometimes the coffee's making you brown.
I'm like,
oh,
just keep drinking it.

1002
01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.020
Right.
I mean,
I don't,

1003
01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:19.590
if I go like I'm going to have this meal or bringing in the toilet with him,

1004
01:04:19.591 --> 01:04:22.890
I wouldn't do that.
No,
I don't do that.
Only because there's poop everywhere.

1005
01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:26.190
Like the bacteria.
I don't even think like,
I just like what?

1006
01:04:26.191 --> 01:04:28.320
I mean why wouldn't you just go back to your food?

1007
01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:31.830
Like just why are you bringing it to the toilet?
It's two birds with one stone.

1008
01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:37.020
You're eating and shitting.
Like that's the symbiotic synergy.

1009
01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:41.790
Synergy.
I Dunno man.
I'm not a big support.
It's a timesaver.

1010
01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:45.600
I'm not gonna lie.
I like the theory of it.
I just don't think it's very hygienic.

1011
01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.640
Yeah,
I don't,
I don't think you should.

1012
01:04:47.790 --> 01:04:51.260
I think there's a lot of poo in the air and,
and that's how you get sick.
Yeah.

1013
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:55.710
I think you should just,
you should eat man.
Shit,

1014
01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.840
I'm shit than eat.

1015
01:04:58.290 --> 01:05:02.850
And if you have food that you want to eat and you also have to shit,

1016
01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:06.150
just wait.
You're going to wipe.
And then what?

1017
01:05:06.151 --> 01:05:09.930
Touched your bowl and then put your bowl down and then wash your hands.

1018
01:05:09.931 --> 01:05:14.270
So now you've,
you've [inaudible] you could be holding.
You have sandy.
Okay.

1019
01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:17.800
Then what do you do it?
So you put the,
okay,
let's walk through it.
I'm shitting.

1020
01:05:17.801 --> 01:05:18.010
I'm

1021
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.350
<v 0>eating the sandy.
Well,
first of all,
you walk in with one hand,</v>

1022
01:05:20.351 --> 01:05:23.320
you lift the toilet seat up that's contaminated.
Your hands already contaminated.

1023
01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:27.200
It's got shit flex on it.
You know what I mean?
Like microbial shit flex.

1024
01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:31.360
I'm sitting down,
I'm shitting and shitting.
I'm eating,
I'm eating,
and then,
oh,

1025
01:05:31.361 --> 01:05:35.490
it's time to wipe.
Now what do I do at the Sandy?
You finish it.
Well,

1026
01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:38.740
I'm not a fast eater like you.
I'm going to say it's half half done.

1027
01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:42.550
I want to put that on a dirty counter.
Was Shit flex here.
Put It on the ground.

1028
01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:44.830
I'm going to wipe,
wipe,
wipe.

1029
01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:49.130
You put it in between your feet on the ground and then you pick it up and you

1030
01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:52.300
finish eating so revolting.
Some people are nasty as hell.

1031
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:56.770
No mother fucking hell right now.
I tell you.

1032
01:05:56.771 --> 01:06:00.070
So Sarah Tiana,
you know Sarah t comedian,

1033
01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:02.890
she and I went to Afghanistan together and we stayed in.

1034
01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:07.030
We stayed in Kandahar,
Afghanistan,

1035
01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:10.060
and in Kandahar is what's known as the poop pond,

1036
01:06:10.570 --> 01:06:14.920
where they put all the sewage from the base into this pond and they turn it,

1037
01:06:15.130 --> 01:06:19.360
it churns.
So you smell shit wafting throughout the base.

1038
01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:23.440
What is that?
It's the poupon of Ken Haar.

1039
01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:28.180
Now what happened was,
uh,
many,
many weeks later she got very,
very,

1040
01:06:28.181 --> 01:06:32.200
very ill with meningitis and in Atlanta,

1041
01:06:32.201 --> 01:06:35.920
she was in Atlanta visiting your folks.
They go where you buy it,

1042
01:06:35.921 --> 01:06:38.410
you know by poo anytime.
And she goes,
yeah,
I was,

1043
01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:42.400
I was in Kandahar about a month ago.
They go like a definitely do it to yeah,

1044
01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:45.380
like in the air.
That's right.
Whoa.
Just having it in.

1045
01:06:45.381 --> 01:06:46.970
And that's how you get things like,

1046
01:06:46.971 --> 01:06:50.740
like just floating in the air and people touch their hands in their mouth and

1047
01:06:50.830 --> 01:06:51.663
the next thing you know,

1048
01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:54.280
counter argument is that like maybe it'll make you stronger.

1049
01:06:54.281 --> 01:06:56.680
So you should do it more.
Maybe it was less than a month.
Actually,

1050
01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:59.410
I would say a couple of weeks after we got back,
maybe you should be doing it.

1051
01:06:59.411 --> 01:07:00.490
Maybe you should be eating on the toilet.

1052
01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:05.640
We settled it all your meals on the toilet.

1053
01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:09.970
And I also heard while you're potty training your kids that they get pink eye

1054
01:07:09.971 --> 01:07:13.390
more because they're touching their eye.
You know,
you can't look a

1055
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:20.430
very full day today.
I want to say she on the toilet and I'm going to say

1056
01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:25.220
anything else need to add gene,
anything you'd say.
Ah,

1057
01:07:25.330 --> 01:07:28.750
for those of you don't know,
my Netflix special comes out October 10th,

1058
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:33.330
mother inferior.
So get ready to watch that.

1059

Amazing,

I just saw artwork.
I just saw a trailer.

1060
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:41.710
Very excited.
It's all being worked on right now.
So the title card,

1061
01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:45.340
the title shows up,
but the card itself isn't up yet.
Sorry.

1062
01:07:45.341 --> 01:07:46.031
We thought it would be,

1063
01:07:46.031 --> 01:07:49.090
but they're still finalizing the artworks and it will be a very soon.
Yeah,

1064
01:07:49.230 --> 01:07:53.440
it's an excellent special.
Thank you guys again for listening.

1074
01:08:46.650 --> 01:08:49.890
Why is it the infrastructure ministers talking about how to implement

1075
01:08:49.891 --> 01:08:53.040
infrastructure funding yet construction workers back to work in Alberta.

1076
01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:55.650
Why does this government treat?

1077
01:08:55.651 --> 01:08:59.790
I'll burn out like a fart in the room that nobody wants to talk about or
