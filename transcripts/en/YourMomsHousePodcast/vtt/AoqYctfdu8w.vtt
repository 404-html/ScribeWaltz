<v 1>I'm like,
Oh

22
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.740
the rap rap rap is perfect.
If this was a radio station right now,

23
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.220
I would be like,
we're playing the song again.

<v 0>There you go.</v>

27
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.790
<v 5>Me and my friends,
friend,
summer.
You know who did it?
No,
gaping dad.
What a talent.</v>

28
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.700
<v 4>Yeah,
that was,
that was uh,
this one.</v>

29
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:19.810
You can tell there's a lot of of work that went cash.
This is what's called,

30
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.980
what the fuck is eco sex by gaping dad.
Really good job

31
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.550
<v 5>man.
My friends summer,
which is grammatically incorrect.</v>

32
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:31.900
It's never me and her real hair on your butt about that.

33
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.560
Because I went to Catholic school and I was taught English by Irish Catholic

34
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.300
nuns and they were sticklers for grammar.
Yeah.
For instance,

35
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:44.620
when you answer the phone and someone goes,
is Tom there?
You don't go,
uh,

36
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.850
this is him.
This is he.
And you never say me.

37
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:51.760
And so and so we're going anywhere cause you sound like cookie monster.

38
00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:53.730
It's wrong.
It's grammatically incorrect.
Huh?

39
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.910
I know you say Tom and I and me and a man,

40
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:02.080
he can me,
me and her.
Yeah.

41
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.200
And that's becoming what's normal now is me and so and so everybody's saying

42
00:04:05.201 --> 00:04:07.870
that people are getting the wrong man.
Before we start,

43
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:12.250
I want to give a big shout out to my light.
They sent us this,
your mom's house,

44
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.310
a light here,
which is so awesome.

45
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.920
And they also sent us one for Ellis for his room.

46
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.120
And I just want to give them a shout out.
It's my light.com.
Dot.
A U,

47
00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:25.780
they're an Australian company.
So if you order one of these lights,
uh,

48
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:29.560
just get an adapter on Amazon.
It was like five bucks and now you've got this,

49
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.990
we have this red light and it changes colors and everything.

50
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.790
<v 4>Um,
they sent it to us.
Mine.
Okay.
I think in November,
I think,</v>

51
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:40.510
cause we just collect Amazon boxes in our entryway.

52
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.180
And then this one more like,
hey,
what's,
what's this one?

53
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.160
And then we open those from you guys.
Well,

54
00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:49.090
and someone had written a light kit on there,
so I thought it was for the studio.

55
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.330
Yeah,
I thought it was like a lighting kit.
So I started on it.
I,
he's like,

56
00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:56.390
I'm must over that.
On accident.
Yeah.
All,
yeah.

57
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.090
Well thank you very much.
It's really cool.

58
00:04:58.091 --> 00:05:02.650
They sent us one for our boy can change colors and search.
Very cool.
Um,

59
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.110
all right.
There's a lot to get into.
Why don't we a do a proper show.
Okay.

60
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.960
It's just like the gays and uh,
here we go.
Let's,
uh,
let's start the show man.

61
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.153
Crap.
Morale.

62
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.530
<v 6>Oh,
ecstasy.</v>

63
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.920
All of the pathways that are involved in sexual pleasure are in fact stimulated

64
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.010
by birthing a baby.
Sure.

65
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.160
And when you can allow yourself to open in the same way that you open to work at

66
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.170
the exact same experience

67
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.270
<v 0>is possible out of your fucking mind.</v>

68
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.810
Don't bring it in one loving to live
well

69
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.890
to your mom's house.

70
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:05.523
Yeah.

71
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.200
<v 6>You know,
um,</v>

72
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.890
<v 7>what I notice about Gaping Dad's music is that he always does close on a fart</v>

73
00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:34.630
sound is it?
It's called a trademark.
Right.

74
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.030
Because like if the,
in his Wikipedia,

75
00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:42.120
it would say one of his trademarks is ending songs with a long,
far,
yeah.
Yeah.

76
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.130
Which is not uncommon actually.

77
00:06:44.131 --> 00:06:48.480
I believe other artists have also ended on a Fart as well.
Yeah.
Or Yeah.

78
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.440
Maybe other things [inaudible] sexy the jewels like no screw.

79
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.020
Yeah.
It goes,
grew.
I ended on far,
it's a lot of people do that,
I guess as as,
um,

80
00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.700
in honor of your mom's house of the predominant theme of our show.
You know,

81
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.520
a lot of,
uh,
producers out there doing their thing and stuff like that.
Yeah.

82
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.690
So this clip I saw when I was looking at birth and clips when I was pregnant

83
00:07:09.691 --> 00:07:14.010
with Ellis.
Yeah.
And this is such fucking bullshit.
I mean,
as far as,

84
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.000
as far as I know,
there's nothing ecstasy are ecstatic about birth.

85
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.440
It's so painful
during birth.

86
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.760
You are,
does that,
did I look like that lady when I was giving birth?
Ellis,

87
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:30.860
this is a a while.

88
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:35.100
So you said that you saw this or I saw this and I thought before you have a

89
00:07:35.101 --> 00:07:38.550
child,
you're like,
sure,
that's possible.
And then if you have given birth three,

90
00:07:38.551 --> 00:07:42.360
you're bad.
You're like,
there's no way that that's even remotely possible.
Yeah.

91
00:07:42.361 --> 00:07:45.930
I didn't think,
um,
I dunno.
I never thought this,

92
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.890
what this documentary is about was a thing.

93
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.790
This is eye opening to say the least.
I think,
honestly,

94
00:07:53.791 --> 00:07:57.930
I think what's happening is these ladies are convincing themselves that it's,

95
00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:01.530
you know,
you're,
you're using your brain,
your mind over matter to be like,

96
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:06.390
this is amazing.
Such a pushback on what is notable pain that they're like,

97
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.420
actually it's pleasurable.
Look at it the right way.
Yeah,
it's like the,
it's,
it's,

98
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.310
it's like,
um,

99
00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:15.690
hypnobirthing like where you use your mind to kind of overcome what you're
doing.

100
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:17.340
Yeah,
but there's,
there's

101
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.520
<v 6>journey with them
please.</v>

102
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:26.700
It's super painful.

103
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.390
It is the most intimate and powerful experience a woman can have.

104
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:38.400
It is a very sensual experience giving birth and stations that are like washing

105
00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:41.540
over here that looks like fun.
I was like,
he's got a spa revolutionary.

106
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.590
It's all relaxing to giving birth,

107
00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:48.350
sensual and sexual nature of birth cannot be denied.
Sure.

108
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:49.823
The potential is

109
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.820
<v 7>actual,
let's see.
I think it's Kinda like,
man,</v>

110
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.320
it'd be like if you have a fever and you're like,
it feels good though.

111
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.970
You just keep telling yourself like when you're like,
diarrhea feels pleasurable.

112
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.700
Eating my ass hole.
Right,
so why doesn't that feel good?

113
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.330
You're right and when I wipe it burns.
But in a good way,
it's essential burn.

114
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:07.963
That's what's happening.

115
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:12.420
Eat some spicy and you're like hot and then you just try to talk yourself out of

116
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:15.730
how hot it is.
I can handle it.
I handled it.
Yeah.

117
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:20.550
Those are just sensations on my tongue.
It's not paying good.
Tastes good.

118
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.200
Take the next bite.
Then you go.
That's what you do.

119
00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:29.250
That's how you eat though or it.
I think these women,
first of all,

120
00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:33.930
for me personally,
there was nothing sexual about giving birth whatsoever.

121
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.980
No,
not,
not a lick.
Especially the part where when contractions begin,

122
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.490
you shit your brains out.
It's like your body's way of,

123
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.140
of cleaning everything out here.
Shooting on the toilet or,
no,

124
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.290
when I went into Labor at home,
I just started shitting.

125
00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:48.030
That's how I knew I was in labor because I'm like,
oh,

126
00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:52.110
I'm having like period cramps and then your body naturally wants to get rid of

127
00:09:52.111 --> 00:09:55.230
everything so that you can push.
I'm assuming it's like nature's Enema,
you know,

128
00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:00.630
so you shit a lot and then,
and then you're just a ton of pain.
Well,

129
00:10:00.631 --> 00:10:03.390
you shit Outta here.
Brown hall and then out your badge all later.

130
00:10:03.391 --> 00:10:08.230
You should have personnel.
Essential experience.
Ever so sensual,

131
00:10:08.231 --> 00:10:09.064
Huh?

132
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.090
<v 6>Crowning essential.
Kind of go inside myself.</v>

133
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:17.450
Really try to begin the centering that I would need to have to make it to labor

134
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:23.860
pain.
Yes.

135
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:37.930
<v 7>Right.
Essential oils.
She said,
I'm going to go through this pain.</v>

136
00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:42.940
She didn't say I'm going to cum super hard and enter the world.
She said pain.

137
00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:47.950
Right.
Which is optional.
You don't have to feel that much.

138
00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:52.840
It does hurt even with an epidural,
but you can choose to not suffer.

139
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.780
And this era,
as a quick aside,

140
00:10:55.781 --> 00:10:59.980
we'll be joined shortly by the creator of [inaudible] talk some shit.

141
00:10:59.981 --> 00:11:00.940
Oh my goodness.

142
00:11:00.941 --> 00:11:05.941
One of the most hilarious videos ever on youtube was made by Brent wine,

143
00:11:07.691 --> 00:11:12.250
Bach,
and he'll be here in a little while.
The creator.
I want to talk some shit.

144
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:16.960
Baby dubs.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Call me.
We're going to get inside of his mind.

145
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:21.770
It is a straight gift from your video too.
Oh,
awesome.
Yeah.
He's a strange ranger.

146
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.900
Back to coming during birth.
It's not possible.
It's pleasure.

147
00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:29.913
Sure.

148
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:38.210
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

149
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:43.020
<v 7>but I think that,
um,
maybe you,</v>

150
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.770
you can trick yourself like that lady who was like,
it was awesome.
I love it.

151
00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.800
Thank you.
Which just shows you how powerful the mind is.

152
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.920
Is he coached her into being like,
yes,
it feels good.
That's what it is.

153
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.850
<v 5>That's what hip no birthing is.
Before I had Ellis,
I went and I got that done.</v>

154
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.590
Where they hypnotize you into reimagining pain and stuff.
Eh,
that doesn't,

155
00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:05.590
it didn't work for me.
Ultimately because this hurts.
This hurts.

156
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.950
It hurts and then you just push through the pain.
But yes,
it is a,

157
00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:13.270
it is a reframing of what's happening.
The doctor and I don't think,

158
00:12:13.271 --> 00:12:18.271
I don't see doctor under your name so that it's possible to cum super hard.

159
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.293
Yeah.

160
00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:20.443
<v 6>Ecstasy.</v>

161
00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:25.630
All of the pathways that are involved in Sam d pleasure are in fact simulated by

162
00:12:28.251 --> 00:12:29.330
birthing a baby.

163
00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.900
And when you can allow yourself to open in the same way that you open to work at

164
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.990
the exact same experience is possible.
Vague.

165
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.200
<v 5>Well,
but not probable.
I'm guessing.
That's another important footnote.</v>

166
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.880
This bitch has never squeezed a person out of her coach.

167
00:12:46.881 --> 00:12:50.430
She don't know what the fuck she is talking.
I don't think so.
Nah.
Hell No.

168
00:12:50.431 --> 00:12:53.270
That's why she's saying stupid shit like this.
She never fucking give birth.
Oh,

169
00:12:53.271 --> 00:12:56.430
okay.
You're just talking like you're like,
I need my privacy.

170
00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.430
Well that's what I'm saying.
What I'm saying when,
oh,
we stroll,

171
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:00.323
you know what I'm saying?

172
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:04.230
Does the hospital decades ago we treated it like it was surgery.

173
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:07.470
They put her in a wheelchair.
She can walk.
She's not sick.

174
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:12.940
I liked sitting in the wheelchair with birth,
uh,
particularly,
uh,

175
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.400
shows like,
er,

176
00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:19.290
people are coming screaming into the Er as though having a baby is the biggest

177
00:13:19.291 --> 00:13:23.360
disaster on earth and dad has imprinted generations of people.

178
00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.720
But that goes,
that does speak to the part that it's psychological.
The pain part.

179
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.250
She's saying it's imprinting to you that this is a terrified.

180
00:13:31.251 --> 00:13:35.400
So maybe like your early impressions are,
this is going to be terrifying.

181
00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.300
When would they should show you is women walking into the Er like,
Ooh,

182
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:44.520
I like,
this feels good.
You know what I wish you would've done,
I mean,

183
00:13:44.521 --> 00:13:47.880
I see all these nice guys coaching their wives and rubbing backs.

184
00:13:47.881 --> 00:13:51.210
I mean you were eating a Burrito at the time?
I was in labor,

185
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:54.960
but like I really wish we could have done it while I was in labor.

186
00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.250
Like why didn't that occur to you?
I didn't do it on the no,

187
00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.820
you don't do it again.
I have another kid.
Navi,
so sensual.

188
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:05.040
Oh fuck.
And then the doctor's like,
keep going time.

189
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:09.930
I mean you're crowning.
What a perfect time to have intercourse.
Let's have sex.

190
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:15.940
<v 8>Oh my God.
Um,</v>

191
00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.240
oh.

192
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:21.981
<v 5>What are you going to do?</v>

193
00:14:21.981 --> 00:14:25.670
Like if I have another baby while I'm giving birth this next time around,

194
00:14:25.671 --> 00:14:28.730
I feel like you should be doing something too.
I'll have another burrito

195
00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.300
that would annoy the shit out of me.
By the way.

196
00:14:32.301 --> 00:14:37.301
You see all these like loving hippy husbands that are squeezing on her belly and

197
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:41.300
massaging her.
I'd be like,
get the fuck away from me.
Do Not fucking touch me.

198
00:14:41.301 --> 00:14:43.850
I'm in so much pain.
You were asking for that.
I would be like,

199
00:14:43.851 --> 00:14:48.230
are you fucking serious?
You're like,

200
00:14:48.231 --> 00:14:52.400
haven't I done enough?
Yeah.
This whole baby making I already noted.

201
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:57.220
<v 7>You want from me?
Yeah.
Well,
there is nothing.
Got</v>

202
00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:03.290
someone that's got to be safe.
Kenny Rogers uninterrupted,

203
00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:07.610
and that is how you will have an orgasmic birth.

204
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.630
The man says the fucking Kenny Rogers old ass man.

205
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.680
How does he know anything about it?
I love when men talk about this shit.

206
00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:17.360
Like they know what it's what it's about.

207
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.970
People always talk about what animals are thinking that,
oh

208
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:27.680
well your dog,
he's nervous about this and he's not sure what will happen next.

209
00:15:27.681 --> 00:15:32.060
I'm like,
oh,
did he tell you that?
How did that come about?
They're like,
yeah,
no,

210
00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:35.330
I I know.
Uh,
your dog right now,
he's,

211
00:15:35.331 --> 00:15:39.590
he's happy about what you did and so you just need to keep doing that and your

212
00:15:39.591 --> 00:15:42.530
dog will stay happy.
Believe animal sidekicks.

213
00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:46.550
I don't believe veterinarians that are like telling me what the dog is thinking.

214
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.120
I understand.
If they're like,
your dog is sick,
the one they're like,

215
00:15:50.121 --> 00:15:54.950
the dog is thinking that you should come home earlier.
I'm like,
uh Huh.
Oh God,

216
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:58.580
stupid.
Is that what the dog thinks?
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right,
great.

217
00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:02.420
Like you know about fucking dogs.
I agree.
Unless you've been there,
done that.

218
00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:05.420
You can't say shit.
You know what I'm saying?
Whatever.
I've studied dogs.

219
00:16:05.421 --> 00:16:08.440
You don't know what the dog's thinking.
No,
this is like this.

220
00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:10.580
Does it know how hard you're going to come when you have a baby?

221
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:15.530
And I wouldn't trust a male gynecologist either.
Fuck that shit.
No way,
dude.

222
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.190
I told you about the one in high school and my town's tell the audience so that

223
00:16:19.191 --> 00:16:20.920
they can hear it.
My friends

224
00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.340
<v 4>dad had a party and we,</v>

225
00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:28.360
I was in high school and we all went over there and there was,
you know,

226
00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:32.680
it was a big party at a big house,
gynecologists,
gynecologists and like,
you know,

227
00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:36.310
uh,
a well respected one.
Um,

228
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:39.220
and so I got him alone for a minute.
I was like,
can I ask you something?

229
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:43.970
I'm a teenager,
so you know,
obviously I'm hypersexual at the time,
right?

230
00:16:43.971 --> 00:16:48.340
And I go,
hey man,
you're a gynecologist.
I go,
how do you separate,

231
00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.970
you know,
of a Jina being,
uh,

232
00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:57.430
stimulating sexually to you versus professional?

233
00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:02.500
How does that happen?
And he goes,
pussies,
pussy.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

234
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:07.450
I'm perverts disgusting.
I looked at him,
I was like,
really?
He's like,
yeah.

235
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:11.650
Yeah.
It basically,
he's basically saying,
oh,
I bite my tongue,

236
00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:13.630
but I'm still thinking about getting them

237
00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:17.270
<v 7>been there.
Snatches all day.
Yeah.
I wouldn't,
I mean,</v>

238
00:17:17.271 --> 00:17:20.540
I wouldn't want to touch balls and all day and I don't know what's going on.

239
00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:24.320
You can study dicks and balls,
but until you yourself have a dick and balls,

240
00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.670
you don't know what's going on.

241
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:30.690
<v 4>You're all just,
she wasn't mine,
but that one I thought,
I thought about that.</v>

242
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.430
I was like,
all you do is look at Dick's all day.

243
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:36.630
I wanted to ask her a Dick Questions,
but it was at,

244
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:39.390
it was a kind of an upscale dinner.
I didn't want to be like,

245
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.250
what's like the biggest Dick you've seen?

246
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:48.090
<v 7>That's what I wanted to ask her.
Of course.
Yeah,
of course.
Yeah.</v>

247
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:53.160
I want to know that because I asked my gunny about nasty snatches and she's

248
00:17:53.251 --> 00:17:57.570
like,
yeah.
Oh,
I asked my gynecologist one time about male gynecologist.
She goes,

249
00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.290
oh yeah,
they're all Weirdos.
She goes,
I would never,
ever.
She goes,

250
00:18:01.291 --> 00:18:05.400
they're all Weirdos.
Psychos Herbert's start jacking those decks when you're,

251
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.480
do you think that's the big temptation?
Probably when she,

252
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.990
why would this woman of all the fields of medicine,

253
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.550
I know everything that's out there,
internal medicine.

254
00:18:17.551 --> 00:18:21.250
You can be a cardiologist,
you could be a podiatrist,

255
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.190
all of them.
And she's like Dixon Baltics and that's what I'm saying,

256
00:18:26.191 --> 00:18:27.580
you've gotta be messed up in your head.

257
00:18:27.581 --> 00:18:30.620
It's not that weird for me to be like you ever started jacking him there.

258
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:34.140
We started sucking on them when you're in there.
Yeah.
Like she,

259
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:37.470
they pulled down their pants and she just starts licking her lips.
Like,
yeah,

260
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:41.190
it tastes these balls like the pornos when they're like,
what if,

261
00:18:41.191 --> 00:18:44.340
but what if that's her special method and that's why her clients are,

262
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.770
there's just so many patients.
Cause she's like,

263
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.230
well first I have to do a taste test on these balls,
sir.

264
00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.470
Would you submit to a taste test?
I don't know.

265
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.560
That guy always has to act like it was like,
I dunno.

266
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.640
I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.
And then shit from across the room.

267
00:18:56.641 --> 00:18:59.490
She goes and she spits on him like,
whoa.

268
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.020
And then as she's like,
I think my nurse is going to have to help me.

269
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:08.130
I'm going to say another female being serious here.
I'm the nurse.

270
00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:13.500
I'm trying to be serious about this.
I mean I'm too,
I'm being serious.
I,

271
00:19:13.501 --> 00:19:17.840
here's why I think anybody would choose that.
Let's keep it real.
It's because um,

272
00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:23.580
because I think that you choose it because it is a little titillating on some

273
00:19:23.701 --> 00:19:27.230
level it might be a repressed like maybe this girl,
the,

274
00:19:27.231 --> 00:19:31.460
this female urologist was like,
you know,
had a strict upbringing.
They're like,

275
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:34.440
no boys,
no dates,
no you study.

276
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:38.010
And then she got the college and then,
then her parents were still like,

277
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:42.270
you better not be going out and getting the basics you need to get to medical

278
00:19:42.271 --> 00:19:44.940
school.
You can not fuck around.
By the time she got there and they're like,

279
00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:48.620
what fields?
She was like,
Dixon balls.
I'm going to,

280
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:52.500
Jack is many dicks and balls as I want here.
I'll show you mom.

281
00:19:52.501 --> 00:19:56.520
And also she has control and hour more so than the actual,

282
00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:00.510
she's the one telling them about what their digital should be doing.

283
00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.280
Especially on men.

284
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:06.180
That's their most prized body part is the taken boss.

285
00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:14.530
<v 6>That's what urologists are</v>

286
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.040
<v 7>and I think it's a power thing.
Control.
Totally.
Definitely.
Think about that.</v>

287
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:30.040
All doctors cause you essentially a point you go like you tell me,

288
00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.640
am I going to live here?
I could make you feel better.

289
00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:38.170
I can tell you the reality of this situation.
I'm there like a version of God,

290
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:43.100
you know?
Yeah.
They're telling you like this is what's going to happen.
Yeah.

291
00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:48.160
I will say during my friend to come from me,
right.
During fertility stuff,

292
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.710
<v 5>like when we conceived Ellis,
I had a two,</v>

293
00:20:50.711 --> 00:20:54.370
I had two male doctors examined me when they give you ultrasounds.
Yeah.

294
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.980
And both were terrible at it.
I had an old ass white guy he beat,

295
00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:02.830
he didn't know where the hole was and he like shoved the other guy,

296
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:04.690
a younger gentlemen.

297
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.310
He had no fucking clue how to get a spot or the ultrasound and it was like,
dude,

298
00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.150
it's so number one,

299
00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:14.010
they don't like that when the females we're seeing if you were dilated.
Yeah.

300
00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:18.310
Checking it.
Yeah.
That one was like jam.
Yeah.
And one of them was like gentle.

301
00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:22.250
Yeah.
That's all in the personality.
I mean the jam when I was like,
Ooh,

302
00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:26.640
why don't you take it easy man,
I,
I could see it.
Oh God.
It's the worst.
Oh Man.

303
00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:30.370
Like,
and it's like glass up there when you're,
when you're really,

304
00:21:30.371 --> 00:21:31.510
really pregnant.
Like your,

305
00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.780
it's hormonal and it just feels like someone's putting nurses like high school

306
00:21:34.781 --> 00:21:39.610
time.
Just like,
oh yeah.
Ready?
Super aggressive.
Yeah.

307
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:43.090
Have you ever had a female,
um,
Dick Doctor?
No.

308
00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:48.190
[inaudible] never had a female.
Really?
I'm trying to think.
No,
no.

309
00:21:48.191 --> 00:21:52.780
Proctology that's one where you go,
Huh?
Why would you choose assholes?
Well,

310
00:21:52.781 --> 00:21:57.550
we need an asshole doctor.
Right.
But to deal with that,
that's fucking gnarly.

311
00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.590
Trying to think if I've ever had a female.

312
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.450
I don't think I've had a female doctor.

313
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:07.040
<v 4>Well No,
cause I mean general physicians now I've had guys,
um hmm.</v>

314
00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.740
No female nurses.

315
00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:13.860
<v 5>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I've never had a male nurse.</v>

316
00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:17.840
Really.
I've had,
I've had male nurses.
Yeah,

317
00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:21.920
<v 4>I'd stood up.
I've had multiple by the way,
but it still stands out.</v>

318
00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:25.040
I'm on the flight yesterday.
They,
um,

319
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:29.960
the first officer got on the PA and was like,
uh,
the pilot said that,

320
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:32.060
um,
we are going to um,

321
00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:36.310
we're going to experience some turbulence and she said to stay in your seats on

322
00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.290
Blah,
blah blah.
So they kept referring to the pilot as a sheet,

323
00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:42.960
which you really is more common,
but it's still stands out.
You're like,
Oh,
is it?

324
00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.910
<v 5>Well,
you can't really make assumptions because what if biologically it's a he,</v>

325
00:22:46.911 --> 00:22:48.850
but she feels like a shame.

326
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.860
<v 4>But then he was using the she pronoun so she might,</v>

327
00:22:51.861 --> 00:22:54.080
she might be comfortable with it,
but to see what you were saying,

328
00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:57.710
maybe a male got their license and then changed.
That's what I'm saying.

329
00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:00.020
<v 5>He could have woken up a mouse,
a man,</v>

330
00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.250
and then by the time the flight took off became mushy.

331
00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:06.620
So Dawkins happening all the time.
Yeah.
Have it all the time.

332
00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:11.390
You got to respect it.
So huge development in the Sigora home.

333
00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:16.280
I,
uh,
I tried to install a tushy on my own,

334
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:19.400
which was a disaster.
We got sent one for free and I was like,

335
00:23:19.401 --> 00:23:23.330
you think I'm so dumb?
Well,
cause they make it sound like it is there.

336
00:23:23.331 --> 00:23:27.050
Like anybody I know you,
I'm like,
you're not going to be like,

337
00:23:27.051 --> 00:23:29.090
let me install this shirt right now.

338
00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:34.490
So of course I ended up ruining the toilet.
It kept overflowing and running.

339
00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:38.360
So I called the handyman and he installed it.

340
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:42.590
And now we have two.
We have a Toshi and the total washlet three 50.

341
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:47.600
He and I have to tell you there are two different toileting experiences.

342
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.450
The total washlet provides a warm spray kind of an all over.
Yeah.

343
00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:56.270
Clean.
Like I like it because it covers the kibbles [inaudible] bits.

344
00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:02.300
That's right.
Now the tushy is expressly for your asshole.

345
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:06.470
That is like a fire hose.
High pressure.
High pressure.

346
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:10.100
Should have tried it today just on your butthole.
Ah,
so it's totally different.

347
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:13.910
It's totally different.
Yeah.
Uh,
both wonderful experiences though.

348
00:24:13.911 --> 00:24:17.220
I recommend either for those of you who are interested in a bad day.
I,

349
00:24:17.221 --> 00:24:21.950
I can't recommend them enough.
But the toasts,
she's like an affordable thing.

350
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:26.320
It is.
How's my hope now?
Huh?
No,
I didn't get the,

351
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:28.220
the warm one water Toshi.

352
00:24:28.221 --> 00:24:31.220
Cause like I didn't want to deal with the plumber coming and doing all that or

353
00:24:31.221 --> 00:24:32.480
electrician,
blah,
blah blah.

354
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.720
<v 4>How was I'm getting that guy over here.
Was that pretty easy though?</v>

355
00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:37.540
<v 5>Oh my God.</v>

356
00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:42.840
So I find this guy through a friend of friend and any goes,

357
00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.810
we're texting back and forth and he goes,
what's your address?

358
00:24:46.811 --> 00:24:49.510
I give him our address and then he goes,
can I have directions?

359
00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:54.100
And I was like this,
that's odd.
But okay,
maybe this person's older.
Yeah.

360
00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:57.610
I don't know how old he is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I give him directions and then he goes,

361
00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.120
well,
is that come coming from north or South or,
and I'm like,
okay,

362
00:25:01.121 --> 00:25:04.990
coming from this way it's,
and it's essentially three things.
Turn right,

363
00:25:04.991 --> 00:25:07.570
turn right turn right.
Yeah.
From where?
From where he is.

364
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:12.700
And he keeps texting me and not understanding what I'm teaching and I,

365
00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.120
so finally I was like,
whatever dude.
Like I just,

366
00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:19.390
I stopped talking to him cause I'm with the kid alone and I can't handle him.

367
00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:23.650
So the day of he texts me,

368
00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:27.520
is it a ride on the bus street?
He's still confused.
Yeah.

369
00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:32.590
And then he calls,
calls me and I'm like,
you know what?
In my head I go,

370
00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:35.710
I can't do with this.
Listen Bro,
if you can't find my house,

371
00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:39.190
you don't have the job.
You basically make that decision.
Right.
You're a moron.

372
00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.460
Well yeah,
cause then I go,
if you can't even find directions to my house,

373
00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.110
how are you going to fix my damn toilet?

374
00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.100
How are you going to fix the God damn door knob?
I need it.
No,
it

375
00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.630
<v 4>just reminds me of that,
by the way.</v>

376
00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:52.430
This is when people ask to like friends asked to come to a show.

377
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:57.620
Oh my God,
stop it.
Yeah.
They're like,
Hey,
I saw you're going to,

378
00:25:57.621 --> 00:26:02.000
you know,
you're gonna be in Montreal and I can I get tickets to this show?
Sure.

379
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:05.910
Okay.
Where do I get the tickets?
I go there,
I will call at the,

380
00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.990
at the buck every other venue ever,
ever under the stars.

381
00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.830
What time should I arrive before the show?
Yeah.

382
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:16.070
Where's shows at eight and they like,
oh,
okay.
Parking's there.
I'm like,

383
00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:19.850
I'm sure it is.
I don't know.
I don't live there so I don't know.

384
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:21.440
And then they're like,
um,

385
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:26.030
is there someone that I should ask for when I get there?
Do you know if,
if,

386
00:26:26.031 --> 00:26:30.080
um,
if there's parking on site or I'll have to park somewhere else and then get

387
00:26:30.081 --> 00:26:34.910
their Google it.
Um,
where should I meet you after the show?
Do you know if,

388
00:26:34.911 --> 00:26:37.460
um,
do you know where,
where in the venue?

389
00:26:37.461 --> 00:26:41.270
My seats will be and I'm like at the,
at a certain point I do the same thing.

390
00:26:41.271 --> 00:26:43.980
I go,
no,
I'm finding it's in hands and

391
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.560
<v 5>then I'll get like 10.
And then after the show they're like,</v>

392
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.500
you know what was texting you earlier?
Like I had my phone off.
I didn't even,

393
00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:53.760
I didn't,
I left it,
I don't even know the day of the guys appointment.

394
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:57.960
Our appointment,
I'm with my son,
I'm alone.
You know toddlers are a handful.

395
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.350
I also don't have access to my phone 24 seven because I'm running around with

396
00:27:01.351 --> 00:27:05.850
the kid.
So he calls me,
leaves me voice mails,
and I'm ignoring him.
At this point,

397
00:27:05.851 --> 00:27:06.720
I'm like,
you know what,
Bro?

398
00:27:06.721 --> 00:27:10.140
If you can't figure that you don't have fucking gps on your fuck,

399
00:27:10.141 --> 00:27:11.190
I know you have a cell phone.

400
00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:14.250
It's all you gotta do is open up Google maps or whatever maps.

401
00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:19.170
He has a cell phone.
So he shows up angry.
He finally finds the house,

402
00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:23.160
he shows up and he's a little like,
I think your phone is off.
And I was like,
Oh,

403
00:27:23.161 --> 00:27:26.910
is it?
Yeah.
Like I lie.
I'm like,
I was with my toddler.
Sorry,
I can't really.

404
00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:31.230
And he and I go,
he goes,
I had a,
I didn't turn right on this or whatever.

405
00:27:31.231 --> 00:27:34.170
He's upset because he couldn't find the street.
And then I go,
well,

406
00:27:34.171 --> 00:27:38.190
don't you have gps?
Oh,
I don't believe in that.
I don't use that.

407
00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:43.500
That's why you're angry.
Right.
Stupid.
So use the technology.
You know why?

408
00:27:43.501 --> 00:27:44.340
Because he's a hippie.

409
00:27:44.341 --> 00:27:47.880
He lives in the mountains and he doesn't use air conditioning.

410
00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:50.490
Yeah.
Yeah.

411
00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.850
And I think he's one of these people that thinks that they're watching.

412
00:27:53.851 --> 00:27:58.851
If he's using gps and I wanted to fucking throw my cell phone and it's,

413
00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:02.160
and I was so angry with them,
111 one day last week.

414
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:05.970
Oh,
and here's the best part.

415
00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:08.190
So we had a couple of other things that he was fixing.

416
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:13.080
This guy was giving me a fucking tutorial as he was doing it.
Like,
well,

417
00:28:13.081 --> 00:28:16.230
you shoot the toilets all working the flusher in this mechanism here.

418
00:28:16.231 --> 00:28:18.710
And I was like,
bro,
Bro,
motherfucker,
listen one though.
I don't want to,

419
00:28:18.711 --> 00:28:21.480
I don't want to be educated.
That's why I'm paying you the $50.

420
00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:25.980
You fucking do this for me.
And he's talking me through what's,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

421
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:29.490
I don't need to hear any of this.
I'm taking care of my kid like you.
You do it.

422
00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.470
That's why I called you asshole,

423
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:35.820
explaining to me why the door knobs aren't working.
I don't care.
I don't care.

424
00:28:35.821 --> 00:28:39.780
Just fix it please.
I don't want to learn.
I don't.
I don't want to learn.
No,

425
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:44.640
I'm too old to learn.
Yeah,
I know.
I feel the same way.
Just fix it.

426
00:28:44.641 --> 00:28:48.660
That's fine.
Make it go away.
That's why you're here.
You know,
like I don't need,

427
00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:53.970
he didn't talk to me about how just does it.
Well,
when you go to a dentist,

428
00:28:53.971 --> 00:28:56.440
you don't want them explaining.
This is how I'm I,
I,

429
00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:59.520
this is why you were educated.
This is your specialty.
You do you,

430
00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:04.450
this specialty was coming while you're giving birth,
orgasmic birth.
Oh,

431
00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:09.510
Jesus will change the way you think about childbirth and yourself forever.

432
00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.710
If you were told that you could have one in the must,
physically,

433
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.510
emotionally,
spiritually,
transcendent moments,

434
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:23.700
back,
tattoos to get there,
which you really say no.
Yes,

435
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:27.480
no,
you wouldn't.
You're lying.
I think.

436
00:29:27.481 --> 00:29:31.760
I wish you'd get a tattoo like that guy.
If I can get it.
Yes,
I will.

437
00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:35.970
I will have a very open mind
if I have another baby.

438
00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:38.220
Bring that lady sexual pleasure.

439
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:41.853
I'm going to show you.

440
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:47.230
<v 7>You know what?
I told my mom yesterday.
She goes,</v>

441
00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:51.280
she was telling me that she farted really big and I go,
hey,

442
00:29:51.281 --> 00:29:53.620
you know you can make 'em,
you can make money.

443
00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.510
And I said,
uh,
if you start recording those

444
00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:04.270
people pay for that online.
And she got so disgusted and so upset and she goes,

445
00:30:04.271 --> 00:30:07.780
I would never lower myself to that.
And I go,
why?

446
00:30:07.781 --> 00:30:11.320
It's extra money to go to the casino.
Um,

447
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:16.480
so here's some like the casino money for you.
And she was like,
ah,
never,

448
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:21.130
never.
But people are making money.
You know what a square,

449
00:30:21.131 --> 00:30:23.680
it's money left on the table as far as I get her money.

450
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.370
<v 9>Yeah,
there you go.</v>

451
00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.310
<v 7>I like this new genre,
the farting in public shot,</v>

452
00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:46.170
probably checking different locations.

453
00:30:46.171 --> 00:30:49.670
I think the nice thing about somebody that's into her video as they go,

454
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.730
I can go to that Walmart,

455
00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:54.240
I can go to where she farted and if I must going to do that,

456
00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:57.270
I mean that'd be a pretty cool following developed.

457
00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:02.140
We've reserved fart mistress dotcom and so far we have not put content on there.

458
00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:04.010
Maybe your mother's the Fart.

459
00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:11.150
Maybe we can just put videos of her.
Trying to be talked into doing it and just,

460
00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:16.980
it's really funny.
The reluctant,
the reluctant Fargo stress.
Yeah,
yeah,

461
00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:19.223
yeah.

462
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:26.390
In the candle aisle,
no less.

463
00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.240
I wonder what her preparation is like when she knows she's going to shoot.

464
00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:33.230
It's so interesting.

465
00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.590
That's really what the interesting thing about these people that do this is
like,

466
00:31:36.591 --> 00:31:39.950
well,
do you know that you're going to have this for breakfast?

467
00:31:39.951 --> 00:31:42.270
And then you can go shoot your video?
I'd assume so.
Yeah.

468
00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:44.180
If I were to do these videos,

469
00:31:44.181 --> 00:31:48.380
I would eat a lot of dried apricot and Vietnamese food to prepare.

470
00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:51.020
I'd have a bowl of pho and then dried apricots,

471
00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.420
<v 9>but
slippers.</v>

472
00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.550
Good one.
Wow.

473
00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:08.850
<v 7>I love this girl.
Yeah,
she's pretty great.
Now she is monetizing these videos,</v>

474
00:32:08.851 --> 00:32:11.250
right?
This is for sale.
Okay,
good.
Yeah.

475
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:16.170
Well I'd hate to think of people wasting our precious farts.
Go to her.
Yeah.

476
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.790
I hate not monetizing them.
You know,

477
00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:23.110
there's an audience out there that what them was trying to tell my mother,

478
00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:29.280
can we please do a phone call where you're explaining this to her about the
fire?

479
00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:33.220
Yeah.
Try calling her.
I'm gonna try calling right now.

480
00:32:33.221 --> 00:32:37.530
Let's say if she can understand this.
Okay,
I'll see if I can get,

481
00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:40.180
I'm dying to have to hear her talk about this.
I mean,

482
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:44.480
good luck getting her fucking answer though.
I mean,
it didn't really is like,

483
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:45.350
well let's text her.

484
00:32:45.351 --> 00:32:49.310
It's like calling somebody a fucking a hundred years ago or something.
You know,

485
00:32:49.311 --> 00:32:52.070
like they're like,
what?
What Day will you be calling?

486
00:32:52.071 --> 00:32:56.030
She might as well say to me because it's so annoying.

487
00:32:56.030 --> 00:33:00.260
Both of them are like this now.
I'm like,
I called you a text.
You,
Oh,
I uh,

488
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:04.910
I left the charging.
I'm like,
Dude,
how often do you leave at charging?

489
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.470
Why do you leave with charging so long?

490
00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:10.750
I texting or Tom's calling you answer your phone.
Hello.

491
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:16.430
All right,
let me see if I can care about this.
I just want to make a phone call.

492
00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:20.540
All right.
Let's see.
I don't have her number even memorized.

493
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:25.940
I'm texting her right now,
so
let's see if she'll do it.

494
00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:31.010
Actually,
emails are just pouring in about the moose soup lady too.

495
00:33:31.011 --> 00:33:34.910
She's really struck a chord with our audience and she struck a chord with my

496
00:33:34.911 --> 00:33:38.450
heart.
I've been thinking about her all weekend to Moose suit.
Yeah.

497
00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:40.940
Well mom reason those Zube later

498
00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:46.730
and her o m g Gosh,
I know.
I just love her.

499
00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:47.840
She's fantastic.

500
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.580
<v 11>Okay.</v>

501
00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.350
<v 7>Oh,
am Jay Jay,</v>

502
00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.430
come on over to my exam lane or

503
00:33:57.810 --> 00:33:59.640
<v 10>o and g.</v>

504
00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:06.550
Calm down and forwarded to automatic voice math later.

505
00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.910
<v 7>Try The house.
None other,
no home.
Oh there.
Oh,
that's right.</v>

506
00:34:09.911 --> 00:34:10.990
They're visiting something.
Yep.

507
00:34:11.890 --> 00:34:12.910
<v 10>Oh,
she is.</v>

508
00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.450
<v 7>I was meant to be.
Okay.
Hello</v>

509
00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.150
<v 10>mom.
God,
Mommy.
Hey,</v>

510
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:24.450
I said to the band.

511
00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:28.250
<v 7>Okay.
I'm in the,
I'm in the,
uh,
no,
no,
I'm in the,
I'm in my office.</v>

512
00:34:28.251 --> 00:34:29.240
I have a different phone there.

513
00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:34.890
<v 10>Hey,
I wanted to ask you real quick.
I did some research.</v>

514
00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:35.910
I found out it's like,

515
00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:40.950
it's pretty serious money you can make if you do some fart videos.

516
00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:45.750
Oh my God.
I'm sitting here and they have to nicer.
But I mean,

517
00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.930
would you consider putting up a couple just to test the market?

518
00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.480
I was talking about the price of the house.
No,

519
00:34:52.481 --> 00:34:55.960
but I'm saying like I think it can generate extra gambling money for you.

520
00:34:55.961 --> 00:34:57.610
For the casinos,
I think.

521
00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:02.570
I think you're looking at maybe a couple thousand a month.
Okay.

522
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:06.410
A month.
Yeah.
And all you gotta do is like,
if you feel one coming,

523
00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:11.120
you just make you just hit record from it.
You just hit record on your,

524
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:14.030
on your iPhone and then send it to me and I'll have,

525
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:17.750
I'll have direct deposit set up for you.
Oh my God.

526
00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:25.920
People will pay $5 $5 per fart video.

527
00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:30.680
I understand what people are avoiding.
You told me and I prayed to God.

528
00:35:30.681 --> 00:35:32.150
I don't get that wrong.
Okay,

529
00:35:32.151 --> 00:35:36.260
but what is there a number that will make you feel comfortable to start?

530
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:45.240
I mean,
I just think that this is a great business opportunity.

531
00:35:45.241 --> 00:35:49.020
That's all its money on the table.
3000 a month.

532
00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:54.730
<v 4>Okay.
I mean,
I'm going to do some research if I can get people to sign up.</v>

533
00:35:54.731 --> 00:35:56.260
Will you start posting videos?

534
00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:58.270
<v 10>Oh my God.</v>

535
00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:06.300
He said,
absolutely.

536
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:20.940
Well,
will you?
Will you consider it?

537
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:26.710
<v 4>Okay.
I'm going to do some research and see if I can get the,</v>

538
00:36:26.711 --> 00:36:28.530
that type of commitment.
And just so you know,

539
00:36:28.531 --> 00:36:32.340
it might be more so I'm just starting low,
but it might go more than that.

540
00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:37.710
<v 10>Gosh,
I can't believe I'm getting excited about.
Okay.</v>

541
00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:42.020
And then also if you could,
do you know what can she do for,
hold on.

542
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:46.620
<v 4>I know already that some people were asking if,
if you could,</v>

543
00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:49.200
when you do these video,
if you do,

544
00:36:49.201 --> 00:36:53.160
like if you feel one and you record it fart and then go like,
oh my gosh,

545
00:36:53.161 --> 00:36:56.290
I didn't mean to do that.
Do they practice like that?
Okay.

546
00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.200
Can you try one for us?

547
00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:04.180
<v 10>Oh my God.
You have to go like,
oh,</v>

548
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.980
you have to go.
Oh,
I didn't mean to,
Oh my God,

549
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:12.510
how do I do it?
What do you mean?
You just have to put a cork.
Yeah.

550
00:37:12.511 --> 00:37:16.480
And then you send me the video.
Like you,

551
00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:20.130
you pull your iPhone up,
you pull your iPhone that,

552
00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:24.910
are you hearing me okay?
Yeah,
I put the iPhone.

553
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:27.850
<v 4>Okay.
You opened video and you put,
you put,</v>

554
00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:32.160
you press record and you record yourself and then you,

555
00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:37.140
you just show the whole thing and then when you're done go like,
oh my gosh,

556
00:37:37.141 --> 00:37:39.270
I didn't mean to do that.
Like it's an accident.

557
00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:43.950
<v 10>I kept going to those who did it</v>

558
00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:47.900
<v 4>well,
yeah,
I mean,
I mean I think that's part of the appeal is they're like,
oh,</v>

559
00:37:47.901 --> 00:37:49.760
this is Tom's mom.
She's farting

560
00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:06.800
<v 10>a lot of gambling.</v>

561
00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:10.940
This could supplement your retirement.

562
00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:23.000
<v 4>Um,
I mean maybe pee in a cup.
I'll look into it.</v>

563
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:26.810
<v 10>Hello.
Talk to him for a second please.</v>

564
00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:36.280
Hey Tommy.
Hey,
what's up man?
The end.
What are you doing?

565
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:38.710
<v 12>What number are you calling from?
Mom did,
wasn't going to answer.</v>

566
00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:41.560
<v 7>It's a,
it's my office line is in the office.</v>

567
00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:42.533
<v 12>Ah,
okay.</v>

568
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:46.400
<v 7>Um,
yeah,
just people were like asking a bunch of questions about,</v>

569
00:38:46.401 --> 00:38:49.290
cause they heard about mom's farts and they're like,
well,
we want to see them.

570
00:38:49.291 --> 00:38:51.240
And then they showed me this site where,

571
00:38:51.241 --> 00:38:54.720
where we can upload her farting and that people are willing to pay for it.

572
00:38:54.721 --> 00:38:55.554
You know?

573
00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.760
<v 12>That is crazy.</v>

574
00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:02.630
<v 7>Yeah.
Yeah.
Do you by any,
anyone,
any chance?
Do you want to do far videos too</v>

575
00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:06.760
<v 12>for money?
I would do four videos all day,</v>

576
00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.150
<v 7>but I mean it might,</v>

577
00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:13.620
it might sour your reputation around town.
That's the only thing I would feel.

578
00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:16.260
I have to tell you.
Could you have to be on camera?

579
00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.030
<v 12>Oh wait.
She has to part with her face being shown.
Yeah.</v>

580
00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:22.703
<v 10>Yeah.</v>

581
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:31.080
<v 12>Now she's saying,
I know why know the as well.</v>

582
00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:33.830
I just sold on,
she's only had like a couple of sips of our wine and I,

583
00:39:33.831 --> 00:39:36.560
by the end of the glass of wine,
I'm sure curious will be down.
Okay.
Okay.

584
00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:38.943
<v 10>Yeah.</v>

585
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:42.250
<v 12>You look,
you look so good.
I'm so proud of you.
I really am.</v>

586
00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:47.200
<v 7>Well,
thank you very much.
Thank you.
Um,
all right,</v>

587
00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.260
I'll uh,
I'll,
I'll let you guys have lunch and then give me a call later,
okay.

588
00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:54.300
<v 10>Okay.
Okay,
good.
All right.
Bye.
Bye.
All right,
bye.</v>

589
00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.660
<v 7>That was pretty amazing.
That was perfect timing.</v>

590
00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:02.450
Your mom was on board until we had to show her face.
Yeah.

591
00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:06.970
And she had,
um,
I was like couple thousand now and she was like,
I don't know,

592
00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:08.830
it's gross.
I'm like,
well,
what does it take three?

593
00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:12.880
She has moved it up $1,000 and was like,
Oh,
far for $1,000.
I mean,

594
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:17.270
I do feel like $3,000 is reasonable for fart videos.

595
00:40:17.271 --> 00:40:21.070
So that's a really good,
good rate.
What is that?
That's 36 grand a year.

596
00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:24.820
That's more than some teachers make.
Absolutely.
I mean,
yeah,

597
00:40:24.821 --> 00:40:27.700
you're never going to have a legitimate job again,
but do you want one?

598
00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:31.870
And she's a 70 something years old.
That's,
that's she's going to,
yeah,
that's,

599
00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:34.630
that's retirement.
That granny fart mistress.
That's pretty,

600
00:40:34.631 --> 00:40:37.120
it's a really good idea.
It looks she's,
she's in retirement.

601
00:40:37.121 --> 00:40:41.550
She doesn't want to work.
I mean,
that will supplement your income.
Yeah.

602
00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:44.980
Your retirement,
whatever checks that they get from the government.
Sure.

603
00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:50.460
And I think it'd be,
you know,
I'd like to be known as the comedian who's mom.

604
00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.800
Yes.
Spark videos.
I mean,
I think that would help my brand.
Yeah.

605
00:40:53.801 --> 00:40:57.940
That's the biggest incentive for me to is people are going to have her start

606
00:40:57.941 --> 00:41:01.960
opening for me on the road.
Interesting.
You guys want to see the grantee farts,

607
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:07.400
right?
She comes out,
puts a mic to her butt goes.
Ah,
my son.
Yeah.

608
00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:08.890
Yeah.
I mean,

609
00:41:08.891 --> 00:41:12.670
it seems like a really good idea and the best part is you could spend time

610
00:41:12.671 --> 00:41:16.000
together on the road.
Yeah.
You can just travel with your mom.

611
00:41:16.001 --> 00:41:19.270
You can stay in the same hotel room as your mom.
You guys really get close,

612
00:41:19.271 --> 00:41:21.820
you know?
Yeah.
That'd be really cool.

613
00:41:21.821 --> 00:41:24.880
And then marry your mom and then we'd have to really start.
But again,

614
00:41:24.881 --> 00:41:29.290
of what interests me is we really have to start paying attention to what she

615
00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:33.740
eats to get the right,
you know?
Right.
Dirty

616
00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.480
<v 5>bit.
Yeah.
Well,</v>

617
00:41:35.481 --> 00:41:40.010
thankfully she's already on a diet that's high gas producing.
That's right.

618
00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:44.930
She already is.
Yeah.
Which is why
I can't,
I can't get enough.

619
00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:48.910
I know.
She said I can't get enough of her if I know who she was.
Yeah.

620
00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:49.520
But you know what?

621
00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:54.230
It does a disservice to the fun of not knowing who she is.

622
00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:59.810
Right.
And we don't want to violate anybody's private privacy.
Yeah.
We enjoy her,

623
00:41:59.811 --> 00:42:01.630
but we don't want her to get bombarded by people.

624
00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:06.150
<v 4>Paul,
the voice more and the imagination more than this is who it is,</v>

625
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:09.570
you know?
Yeah.
I feel like it's more fun that way personally,

626
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:12.230
<v 5>but we do know what she looks like is what you're saying.
Yeah.</v>

627
00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:15.050
So can we at least describe her to the audience?

628
00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.370
I'll just say we were both wrong.
Yeah.
Well we can say that.
You know,

629
00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:21.170
I don't want to,
well,
not now.
There's a face to it.

630
00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:24.770
It changes the dynamic set of Burnett,
like a malady.
Burnett.

631
00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:28.680
She was a Brunette before she went gray,
so we can say that she's great.
Yeah,

632
00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:32.270
but she had been bed big honkers big slops.
Yeah.

633
00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:37.040
She's an older lady and she's real.
I'd say she's just stocky,
like thick.

634
00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:39.420
Yeah.
Kind of like thicker legs and yeah.

635
00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:43.880
<v 4>Broader,
older.
Not at,
not at the fatty or anything like that.
Right now,</v>

636
00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:45.500
by the way,
I want to mention this.

637
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:48.020
I mentioned at the top when we did all our stuff,

638
00:42:48.021 --> 00:42:50.540
but I know there's people that skip all that.
Um,

639
00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:54.490
so I have to mention it once during the show.
And that is if a,

640
00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:57.830
if you're in mum straight Lya um,
you and you skip the top.

641
00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:02.810
I am having to move my dates due to a scheduling conflict.

642
00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:08.030
I,
I tried to move it twice,
two sooner.

643
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:11.900
Um,
and it,
it'd be Doodoo venue availability.

644
00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:17.410
It's moved till April.
You said do,
do,
do,
do,
do,
do,
uh,

645
00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:20.450
availability is moved to April.
And I know that's a ways away.

646
00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:25.160
That's just the way it worked out.
Uh,
I'm,
I'm sorry that it's put off that long,

647
00:43:25.161 --> 00:43:30.130
but that's just the way it is.
So the,

648
00:43:30.131 --> 00:43:33.200
um,
the tickets are still good for your,

649
00:43:33.201 --> 00:43:37.070
for the new shows you've probably been contacted.
If you don't want to go,

650
00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:40.850
you can get a refund,
but that's,
um,
that's just the way it is.

651
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.230
So I apologize.
But that's what is going to happen with that.

652
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:47.330
Okay.
So I had to tell him,

653
00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:50.480
<v 5>um,
I wanted to bring up a topic now.</v>

654
00:43:50.481 --> 00:43:55.160
You started to talk about it yesterday when you got home from your long journey.

655
00:43:55.161 --> 00:43:55.330
Yes.

656
00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:58.870
<v 4>Yeah.
Which I have to say was awesome in the dirty,
dirty.
Yeah.</v>

657
00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:03.880
So thank you to everybody that was in those cities.
Uh,
Richmond,
Virginia Beach,

658
00:44:03.881 --> 00:44:08.080
Greensboro,
Asheville,
and uh,
Charleston,
which is where my sister is,

659
00:44:08.081 --> 00:44:09.820
which is who I was just speaking to.

660
00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:14.440
So I got to hang out with her a little bit and the shows were bananas member I

661
00:44:14.441 --> 00:44:16.870
was announcing on this show that Charleston,
I was like,

662
00:44:16.871 --> 00:44:21.010
we need you to get some tickets in the last week leading up to the show.

663
00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:22.330
The ticket sales doubled.

664
00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:26.460
<v 5>Wow.
For that.
Fantastic.
That's mommy power right there.
Yeah.
It's pretty crazy.</v>

665
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:29.690
That's the power of the jeans.
Yeah.
Gene powers.
Um,

666
00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:32.040
so you came home and I,

667
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:36.960
<v 7>you started to talk about how you actually preferred plain shits.</v>

668
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:41.280
And I go and I go stop you right there.
I'm going to write that down.

669
00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:44.630
Come up from some moose soup and we'll talk about this on the shelf.
That's true.

670
00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:47.800
I was starting to tell you and you're like,
just stop,
save it.
Save it.

671
00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:51.540
As I was saying was this,
there's no better place to shit that in your own house.

672
00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:56.550
That's number one.
Yeah.
And then if you're,
if you're traveling your hotel room,

673
00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:00.840
you have your privacy,
you have your own amenities.
I know,
but you,

674
00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:03.070
I mean like you can jump in the shower,
you can do what you want it,

675
00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:06.750
it's still like a mo your travel home.
Right.
So you're still,

676
00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.760
once you leave there,

677
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:14.130
the only thing I like about the plane as opposed to let's say the airport stall

678
00:45:14.131 --> 00:45:17.370
is that it sucks.
It sucks shitting on a plane.
Yeah.
Sucks.

679
00:45:17.371 --> 00:45:21.510
I get like I get performance anxiety.
That's the one,
that's her worst part.

680
00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:22.710
But here's the good part.

681
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:28.190
You're shitting there right where your left elbow or right elbow is depending on

682
00:45:28.261 --> 00:45:32.100
the layout of that plane is the sink.

683
00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:36.720
It's right there.
And they usually,
in my experience have like piping hot water.

684
00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:42.230
So what I'll do is I'll shit and then not toilet toilet paper is,

685
00:45:42.691 --> 00:45:45.540
is on planes is really low quality.
I hate that.

686
00:45:45.541 --> 00:45:50.541
So I'll take paper towels because they're thicker and I'll soak them in piping

687
00:45:51.331 --> 00:45:55.920
hot water and then I'll start to wash my ass hole with that.

688
00:45:56.550 --> 00:46:01.440
And I get,
I get the sensation eventually of being so clean because I'm,

689
00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:05.460
I'm using a thicker paper that doesn't tear like their toilet.
They're cheap.

690
00:46:05.461 --> 00:46:09.090
Toilet paper does.
And I have hot water cleaning out that area.

691
00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:14.570
So I actually prefer that to an airport stall because I don't feel as clean.

692
00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:19.710
What you're saying is you like the proximity of the sink to the toilet and that

693
00:46:19.711 --> 00:46:23.460
is something that enhances the whole misery,
the toilet shit.

694
00:46:23.461 --> 00:46:26.580
Because if you're in the stall,
if you're like,
I want to,
I want that.

695
00:46:26.581 --> 00:46:30.840
You'd have to leave your stall.
Ah,
a wet something under the sink.

696
00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:35.130
Go back to the stall.
Like you know,
I've done that by the way I've done it,

697
00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:40.200
but it's a much more tedious.
And you've done that in public?
Yeah.
I swear.

698
00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:45.480
I swear in an airport you're not afraid.
And what do you do with your pants?

699
00:46:45.481 --> 00:46:49.740
You leave them around your ankles.
Well,
no.
What I did was like,
I cleaned up well,

700
00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:51.800
but I was like,
I want another level of claims.

701
00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:56.580
So I went out wet toilet paper in front of people,
took it back into the store.

702
00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:00.640
Shut the,
did you pull your pants up over your dirty ass holes?
Yeah.
Yeah.

703
00:47:00.641 --> 00:47:02.460
But I also left the buckle and stuff open.

704
00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:05.400
I left the paint everybody near one news.
I was cleaning my ass.
Yeah.

705
00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:09.640
But guys don't care guys.
Guys don't care.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.

706
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:12.660
That's so nasty.
It was the last time you did that this week.

707
00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:18.450
One of these years I was in five airports.
I don't know.
I wasn't,

708
00:47:18.451 --> 00:47:21.060
I was into airports,
right?
Three,
I don't fucking remember.

709
00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:24.420
I wasn't one of them though.
Maybe O'Hare.
I did it in.
Oh,
that's a good way.

710
00:47:24.421 --> 00:47:28.380
I think it's a huge airport.
That's a fucking,

711
00:47:28.381 --> 00:47:30.070
can I read an to you before we

712
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:31.950
<v 5>roll along here?
Sure.
Um,</v>

713
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:37.060
I think it's kind of fitting apropos our current discussion.

714
00:47:37.061 --> 00:47:40.510
Hold on.
Oh Geez.

715
00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:44.830
Okay.
Here we go.
As,
okay.
Hi,

716
00:47:44.831 --> 00:47:47.800
Mommy's as the water champ of Bristol,
England.

717
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.020
While staying exceptionally hydrated,

718
00:47:50.021 --> 00:47:54.850
I have switched to a water meter from a fixed fee water billing system as an

719
00:47:54.851 --> 00:47:59.851
incentive to save water lest the reservoirs run dry due to my advanced water

720
00:48:00.161 --> 00:48:03.100
intake.
As I am now paying per flush,

721
00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:06.490
I have to put a cap of two flushes per brown.

722
00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:08.260
This means there are,

723
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:13.470
there is sometimes a little fun buoyant Brown Nugget remaining in the book which

724
00:48:14.501 --> 00:48:15.334
me,

725
00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:20.400
which my gene is obliged to Brown on top of before using any of her assigned

726
00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:25.960
flushes.
Fucking crazy.
She thinks that our browns touching is weird.

727
00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:27.970
It didn't know she touches my wiener.

728
00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:32.800
I like to sell her this idea by pointing out that the little brown is probably

729
00:48:32.801 --> 00:48:37.801
lonely and needs a few down pedal nuggets to support it into the murky world of

730
00:48:38.141 --> 00:48:39.460
the British sewage system.

731
00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:44.850
Please could you confirm or deny if you have a similar Negi Buddy policy or if

732
00:48:45.071 --> 00:48:49.510
you enforce a water wasteful flush till gone system waste,

733
00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:52.250
wasted up,
waste all that water.
Now I,

734
00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.390
I'm afraid I'm going to have to call you out here a little bit,

735
00:48:55.391 --> 00:49:00.220
but I would say half the time I go to use the toilet,

736
00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:03.970
there's one in your little brown nuggies floating.
Others not,
yeah.
What?

737
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.970
There's a lot of your brown eggs or you,

738
00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:10.720
what you do is you leave a final wiper of paper and you leave it just at the

739
00:49:10.721 --> 00:49:14.020
bottom of the time.
Yes.

740
00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:18.700
Can I leave a lot of teeny tiny nuggets?
I don't know how.
All right,

741
00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:23.740
I flush and then I can say this.
Or you waste the water though.
Of course.

742
00:49:23.741 --> 00:49:28.360
I wasted say that.
I don't ever intend for nuggets to be there.
Um,

743
00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:31.630
the,
the last sheet of paper is a trademark.

744
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:34.480
Something I've been doing for you have been,

745
00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:37.090
I want people to know that like I was there,
but I don't,

746
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:41.530
I don't do it with nuggets.
You wasn't shit on my nugget.
You would flush before.

747
00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:45.740
Oh fuck.
Yeah.
I know.
Automatic automatic to me.
Me Too.

748
00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:47.140
I think it's disgusting.

749
00:49:47.141 --> 00:49:50.920
And I don't understand this 12 flushing system you guys have.

750
00:49:50.921 --> 00:49:52.840
That sounds terrible.
And here

751
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.130
in America we just waste use nasty bro.

752
00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:01.160
And I also got an email from a couple who they um,

753
00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:05.050
they're browns seem to come on at the same time in the morning and they,

754
00:50:05.051 --> 00:50:09.130
I'm assuming have one toilet.
No,
you and I had one toilet for a million years.

755
00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:13.150
And what did we do when we both had the brown at the same time?

756
00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:19.090
I think w I think what happens is we realize that when you say I gotta go shit,

757
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:23.770
you can hold it for another hour before you can hold it for a while.
Yeah.

758
00:50:24.310 --> 00:50:27.650
Whereas when I say I got to shit,
it means I have to go now.
So you're like,

759
00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.040
I got to

760
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.730
<v 4>go in the next 30 seconds.
Yeah.
That's what it is.</v>

761
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.410
Why do you have an emergency system in there?

762
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:36.170
I mean it's just like you should be like,
oh,
I got a signal.

763
00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:41.330
I should do this later.
It's like a flare.
Yeah,
no,
I got an interesting email.

764
00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:44.030
Yeah.
This is really for me.
But you can comment on this too,

765
00:50:44.031 --> 00:50:47.750
since actually the two of us can,
can,
can comment.

766
00:50:47.751 --> 00:50:52.400
So this is a Chubby chaser seeking advice.
She writes,
hello,

767
00:50:52.401 --> 00:50:53.720
Tommy and Tina.

768
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:57.020
I am writing because I have a problem I think you may be able to help me with.

769
00:50:57.050 --> 00:51:01.610
About a year ago I met a guy at a friend's wedding.
We got along great dancing,

770
00:51:01.611 --> 00:51:03.170
joking together most of the night.

771
00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:06.770
At the end of the night he asked for my number and I didn't hesitate to give it

772
00:51:06.771 --> 00:51:08.300
to him.
We joke around,

773
00:51:08.301 --> 00:51:12.140
flirt a lot through texts and snapchat often saying we went to hang out,

774
00:51:12.141 --> 00:51:13.700
but nothing has come to fruition.

775
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:18.800
Usually I would tell this fuck boy to kiss my pussy and not worry about it as he

776
00:51:18.801 --> 00:51:23.330
obviously wears his pants low and loose,
but I have a theory I may be able to,
uh,

777
00:51:23.331 --> 00:51:26.300
you may be able to offer some insight on this guy has chubby.

778
00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:31.040
I make fitness,
all of the fitness.
I take very good.

779
00:51:31.041 --> 00:51:33.470
Sarah care of myself.
I'm in very good shape.

780
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:37.310
Could this have anything to do with his hesitation to pull the trigger and see

781
00:51:37.311 --> 00:51:40.100
me again?
I usually date other fit people.

782
00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:43.520
So I do not have a frame of reference for this adorable doughboy.

783
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:47.960
Maybe insecurity keeps him from wanting to take his clothes off in front of me.

784
00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:50.120
Maybe he will feel you feel judged.

785
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:55.150
Maybe it's just like the case seeing as how Tommy used to be fat and mommy time.

786
00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:59.060
Tina was obviously into it.

787
00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:02.720
I was wondering if you two could give me some words of wisdom.

788
00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:08.020
Maybe this is a better question for burnt Chrysler seeing as he is still fat.

789
00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:09.890
Thanks Hitler.

790
00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:15.070
Brittany think it's an excellent question and it brings a lot of discussion

791
00:52:15.111 --> 00:52:17.990
points to light.
Um,
number one,

792
00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:21.890
let's go through the possibilities.
Number one,

793
00:52:21.891 --> 00:52:26.480
there is one possibility that this guy is not interested.

794
00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:30.020
That's a possibility.
Yeah,
but he did ask for her number,

795
00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:32.930
so that's why I would probably take that.

796
00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:35.300
I mean take that kind of off the table.

797
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:37.880
He has a girlfriend or somebody who is seeing right now.

798
00:52:37.881 --> 00:52:41.450
Maybe those are possible,
but maybe she,
she would,
she,

799
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:43.100
if they're communicating he would probably,

800
00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:46.190
she would probably know if he has a girlfriend,
you know,
it's possible.

801
00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:48.800
So I'm saying that's option one,
he's not indoor.

802
00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:54.400
Option two could be that you're totally correct and that he is just super

803
00:52:54.741 --> 00:52:55.340
insecure,

804
00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:59.660
in which case I think just like no matter what somebody's insecurities are,

805
00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:04.280
they need reassurance.
They need reassurance that you are not,

806
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:08.800
um,
that like that you're attracted to them,
you know?
So,

807
00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:11.480
and also I would say that guys,

808
00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:15.410
regardless of their bodies and physiques,

809
00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:19.730
most of the time need to be hit on the head with information,

810
00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:24.770
especially when it comes to a lot of guys don't assume that you're attracted.

811
00:53:24.771 --> 00:53:26.130
I mean there's the chaser.
There's a guy

812
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:28.020
<v 7>that's always,
but a lot of guys are the [inaudible]</v>

813
00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:32.550
<v 4>type that go,
I didn't know your into me,
you know,
like I,</v>

814
00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:34.950
I feel like maybe women,
um,

815
00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:38.110
I'm making assumptions here are more of the opposite of that.

816
00:53:38.410 --> 00:53:40.990
But I feel like a lot of guys are the types that are like,

817
00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:45.280
I'm not going to assume that it's a reciprocated.

818
00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:47.300
<v 7>Yeah,
it's funny.
I think it's the exact opposite.</v>

819
00:53:47.301 --> 00:53:51.740
I think a lot of men assume that you're in to them when you just say hello.
Oh,

820
00:53:51.741 --> 00:53:56.270
you're like fuck me.
I'm like,
I know.
Just being nice.
Yeah,
I could see that.

821
00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:58.520
I guess it goes for both sexes in,
because I had nice,

822
00:53:58.521 --> 00:54:01.850
that's why you're a decent man and that's why you don't assume that everyone

823
00:54:01.851 --> 00:54:04.430
wants to fuck you because you are actually sweet human being,

824
00:54:04.431 --> 00:54:08.720
which is why I married you.
I usually did not assume that of course,

825
00:54:08.721 --> 00:54:12.350
because you're a nice guy.
I like nice guys.
I married the best one.

826
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:16.650
That's why I had to be told yes directly by people,
you know.
Yeah,

827
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:20.690
but that's why you're special and that's why I think you're the absolute best

828
00:54:20.691 --> 00:54:23.870
human being and that's why we're married and we've been together for 12 years.

829
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:28.190
Cause I,
I adore you for that.
Oh that's very sweet.
And you're not a Douche bag.

830
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:33.380
No,
I wouldn't.
Blame is,
wait,
it sounds like she's wait focused here.
Well she's,

831
00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:36.490
she's bringing about an interesting point because what she's saying is that

832
00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:41.120
she's super fit.
He's not,
they do communicate.
They do flirt.
They do tag.
Okay.

833
00:54:41.121 --> 00:54:45.950
Okay.
He's not pulling the trigger.
She's into him.
How does she,
like,

834
00:54:46.310 --> 00:54:49.700
my point would be that I'm trying to put myself in the guy's position.

835
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:54.700
Maybe if she is correct and her assumption that he's insecure about it.
What,

836
00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:58.610
what helps is reassurance.
Right,
right,
right.
So you actually have to be in,

837
00:54:58.611 --> 00:54:59.600
if that's the case,

838
00:54:59.810 --> 00:55:04.340
more blatant yet to be blamed that you're okay with him not being into fitness.

839
00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:09.200
Well,
not in the fitness and like without saying like even though you're this,

840
00:55:09.201 --> 00:55:12.680
it's like I'm attracted to you.
Right.
I like this.
Yeah.

841
00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:15.590
The thing is he's probably freaking like,

842
00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:19.760
I don't want to run 10 miles a day to hang out with this chick.

843
00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:20.990
I don't want to go to the gym.

844
00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:25.580
This is not something I don't wear a lifestyle different.
Right.
Right.

845
00:55:25.581 --> 00:55:27.340
This isn't going to work.
That fit.
Yeah.

846
00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:30.680
Cause she sound like she makes fitness in her all the time.
All the fitness.
Yeah.

847
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:33.800
So she makes all the fitness.
He makes none of the fitness.
Yeah.

848
00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:38.810
Now the reason you and I worked I think is because I had the soul of a fat

849
00:55:38.811 --> 00:55:42.800
person.
Always.
Yeah.
I never wanted to go exercising with you.

850
00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:46.760
So we weren't so divergent on lifestyle.
The lifestyle is a thing,

851
00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:47.721
but you can also,

852
00:55:47.721 --> 00:55:51.680
it's also good and I think in relationship to have some different interests,

853
00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:54.350
things that I do is things that you do that are not your like go dig.

854
00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:59.090
I read books,
not true words and,
but so she could be the type that's like,

855
00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:03.170
I'm going to go fucking rock climbing.
And he's like,
that sounds terrible.

856
00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:07.520
Bake something.
I Dunno.
Like it could just be,
but he needs reassurance.
Yeah.

857
00:56:07.521 --> 00:56:11.810
You should,
you reassurance and obvious like,
and I mean,
I know that like,

858
00:56:11.811 --> 00:56:14.300
you're like,
well,
pull the trigger,
but maybe you got it.

859
00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:19.040
<v 4>Be like,
Hey,
I'm this Saturday,
um,</v>

860
00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:23.190
<v 7>no,
whatever's going on or I know this bar or I want to see this move.
Like,</v>

861
00:56:23.191 --> 00:56:24.160
just make

862
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:28.960
<v 4>it audience.
Yeah.
And then,
and then when you're with him,
you know,</v>

863
00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:34.420
make your interests obvious.
Yeah.
You know,
uh,

864
00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:39.070
whatever.
It's like,
you don't have to be like,
pull that dig out,
but you start,

865
00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:40.150
you know,
get handsy.

866
00:56:40.570 --> 00:56:44.410
Put the hands on the back thigh hands.

867
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:48.250
You know thy hands.
That's really forward.
Yeah.

868
00:56:48.251 --> 00:56:50.800
But you do it like for a second.
You don't leave it there.
Right.

869
00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:55.570
You just give him a signal.
The signal is like,
Hey,
I like you.

870
00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:59.570
Or if he needs the reassurance grace,
like,
oh,
I got it.

871
00:56:59.571 --> 00:57:01.990
It was too much reaching for the Napkin.
Oops.
Did I?

872
00:57:01.991 --> 00:57:06.190
Every guy knows that thigh hands are like,
oh yeah.
Is that right?
Yeah.

873
00:57:06.191 --> 00:57:10.450
Because it's not,
it's not,
um,
it's not slutty.
It's like,

874
00:57:10.451 --> 00:57:13.930
it's a signal.
It's just like,
I like you,
it's,
it's,
I like you.

875
00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:18.970
This is a part of your body that's not,
um,
like a too personal to touch.

876
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:19.300
Right.

877
00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:23.410
But it's enough to send you the signal that this hand can go higher and your
leg.

878
00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:24.880
Did I let you know that I liked you?

879
00:57:24.881 --> 00:57:29.280
How did you know that I liked you eventually?
Um,
well,
you know,

880
00:57:29.281 --> 00:57:33.480
I had a little heads up from your friend and that's what it was.
Yeah.

881
00:57:33.481 --> 00:57:36.730
So he was like,
you know,
there's an open door.
Here is what he told him.

882
00:57:36.731 --> 00:57:41.230
Like you can,
you can make a phone call and uh,
see what's up with this bet,

883
00:57:41.231 --> 00:57:45.090
you know?
And I was like,
that's what he said.
And then I was like,

884
00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:49.350
well pitch pitches that again like with how we talk.
And then I was like,

885
00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:52.530
hit me up with those digits real quick and you're sweet.
I was like,
so

886
00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:57.940
<v 5>bitch,
I reminded you.
Um,
one time we were in like in like dating,</v>

887
00:57:57.941 --> 00:58:00.820
courting early phases of our,
you know,

888
00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:02.950
thing whenever we were friends first.

889
00:58:03.130 --> 00:58:07.600
So we transitioned from friendship to dating.
Yeah.
And I remember being like,
oh,

890
00:58:07.601 --> 00:58:12.340
are you going to so and so's party this weekend?
Yeah,
no,
yeah,
you're going to my,

891
00:58:12.341 --> 00:58:14.320
and you go and then you didn't go.

892
00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:17.680
And I was hoping to see you there and then I talk to you later and you're all,

893
00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:19.210
oh,
I fell asleep on the couch.

894
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:24.540
<v 4>I was like,
this is,
remember some,
we don't have a house phone in here</v>

895
00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:28.740
and he probably doesn't have a self phone.
Definitely doesn't.
Great.

896
00:58:28.741 --> 00:58:32.190
We got to go get one that's um,
press pause,

897
00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:37.380
pause and wait till a,
the weasel gets here.
Okay.
You know what I mean?
Be wheezy.

898
00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:39.720
The weasels a different part.
I know.
You know what I mean though.

899
00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:41.520
We'll be back in a moment.
Okay.

900
00:58:41.521 --> 00:58:46.521
Mommy and we set up the way obviously for a moment there but we are back.

901
00:58:48.361 --> 00:58:52.140
We're joined by our guests that we teased earlier in the show.

902
00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:55.170
You want to talk some shit?
He's here with us right now.

903
00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:58.960
The creator of the,
you want to talk some shit?
Yeah,

904
00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:03.870
the 800 party gangster party line.
Oh my God.
The wheezy Brent.
Why Umbach is here.

905
00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:08.743
<v 2>It does.</v>

906
00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:12.130
<v 4>Nice intro and a nice little tight little soundbite too.
Yeah,</v>

907
00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:16.070
it was a tight bite type.
I like those type fights.
Yeah.

908
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:21.100
<v 5>I will say that the gangster party line is my hands down like my favorite sketch</v>

909
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:22.280
ever done ever.

910
00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:27.160
<v 13>It's so funny.
And and,
and you actually had that phone number up for a walk.</v>

911
00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:30.080
It's still up.
People still call it all the time.
We could take calls,

912
00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:33.800
we should actually maybe try to take calls if it's an easy setup.

913
00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:37.760
All I need is the log in and do a g mail account and we can take calls,

914
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:42.620
the sand talk all the time.
It's still,
you know,
all the time during the day.

915
00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:45.920
And what did they say?
What's the,
uh,
sometimes it's just hang up.

916
00:59:45.921 --> 00:59:47.950
Sometimes they just say something short,
you know,

917
00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:50.900
but sometimes they go on rants and I mean,

918
00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:55.640
we posted a lot of the messages that people would leave,
uh,
you know,

919
00:59:55.641 --> 00:59:59.540
on this website,
gangster party,
line.com,
and there's all kinds of fun.

920
00:59:59.590 --> 01:00:00.423
You even did,

921
01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:05.750
your online sketch was such a success that even did like a follow up.

922
01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:10.310
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
We just,
we took some calls,
you know.

923
01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:15.230
How did you produce it?
Like how did you,
Oh,
uh,
just,
you know,

924
01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:20.120
La puts put a notice up on La casting and Craig's list and,

925
01:00:20.121 --> 01:00:24.840
um,
that was pretty much it.
My friend had a house that we could use.
Uh,

926
01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:28.530
where did you hold your casting sessions?
Did you find that office?
Yeah,
my,

927
01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:33.500
we use my friend's families business,
uh,
like some on the weekend.

928
01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:38.390
Okay.
We use the,
an office in there and have people come in on the weekend.
Yeah.

929
01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:43.760
The dude that played like the,
the face of,
you know,
yeah.

930
01:00:43.810 --> 01:00:48.220
The main,
the main gangster.
Yeah,
he had like a very Leland white,

931
01:00:48.221 --> 01:00:49.530
his name is a very,

932
01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:54.650
a accent for delivery of the lines.
Oh,
you thought so.

933
01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:58.350
I thought Oh,
interesting.
Yeah.
Like what was that?
Learning about California way.

934
01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:02.330
There's like,
there's a California diction for that.

935
01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:05.450
Like I think especially if you listened to a lot of hip hop,

936
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:08.480
some guys can say certain words and you're like,
oh,
that's a west coast guy.

937
01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:12.260
You know?
That's interesting.
I mean,
is there any specific thing specific you can,

938
01:01:12.261 --> 01:01:17.210
uh,
uh,
I mean for people that don't know,
yeah,
we can write,

939
01:01:17.211 --> 01:01:20.120
there's no like course licensing.
Very few.

940
01:01:20.121 --> 01:01:24.050
I mean like we were such a huge fan of the sketch that we may talk to their
fans.

941
01:01:24.051 --> 01:01:28.250
I got,
I got some news for you and a little bit.
Oh really?
Well,
yeah,

942
01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:31.340
there's going to be more,
more gangster party line.
Well,

943
01:01:31.341 --> 01:01:34.760
more hotline videos in one more gangster party line video.
Really.

944
01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:38.860
You've been making them?
Yeah.
May earlier this year have made a,
it was,

945
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:43.280
it was a huge project,
but there was,
um,
made five hotline,
new hotline videos,

946
01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.710
one of them being SQL to gauge the party line.

947
01:01:45.711 --> 01:01:49.960
But then the other four are different themes,
different party lines.
Basically.

948
01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:56.240
Where should we go for it?
Where do you like it to be played off of Youtube?
Sure.

949
01:01:56.241 --> 01:02:00.470
Youtube that's go to the source.
I mean these days do I type in Brent Wine Bach?

950
01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.880
Sure.
You go to my youtube channel,

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.720
Plastic Niggas,

992
01:04:39.010 --> 01:04:42.580
mystery Niggas Cycle Niggas.

993
01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:46.630
Y'All niggas Jewish sneakers,

994
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:49.190
motherfucking nerves calling me.
I'll box.

995
01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:53.320
It's a little bullshit ass Nigga got a calm that shit down and come right here.

996
01:04:53.321 --> 01:04:56.530
Show me some fucking respect for me and my Jewish Nigga come up here and beat

997
01:04:56.531 --> 01:04:57.890
your ass niggas.
Okay.

998
01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:02.300
<v 13>That guy mostly and mostly it was improvising and I told him hit Shabbat.
I said,</v>

999
01:05:02.550 --> 01:05:05.810
you got some nerve calling me,
I should buy.
I told him,
you know,
say that.
Yeah.

1000
01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:08.660
I said,
there's a couple of other things and told him to hit,
but a lot of this,

1001
01:05:08.661 --> 01:05:10.670
he's just kind of,
he was really good,

1002
01:05:10.671 --> 01:05:12.380
and I think I said this in the followup video,

1003
01:05:12.381 --> 01:05:15.410
but he's really good at improvising or playing,
doing it loose.

1004
01:05:15.411 --> 01:05:17.620
But whenever we tried to do things on the by lines,

1005
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:20.740
he wasn't able to limit it as much.

1006
01:05:20.770 --> 01:05:25.500
The great thing about him appearing here in the,
as far as like in the,
the,
um,

1007
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:29.470
the ordinary is that this absolutely,
like,

1008
01:05:29.471 --> 01:05:33.040
just when you feel like you've hit,
got the joke,
got the,
yeah,

1009
01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:36.610
this dude completes,
he shuts it down.
And it also helps,

1010
01:05:36.611 --> 01:05:40.840
like if you're listening right now to see him and to see the way he says this,

1011
01:05:40.841 --> 01:05:45.010
like the way that he looks around where he's almost like,
part of you is like,

1012
01:05:45.011 --> 01:05:48.800
he's trying to remember what to say,
but part of you,
he's like,
you know,
he,

1013
01:05:48.801 --> 01:05:53.480
he doesn't really stop.
He goes,
yeah,
it's,
um,
it's definitely,

1014
01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:56.830
he was awesome.
He did a great job and he'll be

1015
01:05:58.350 --> 01:06:02.650
finding it to the side.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Oh Man.

1016
01:06:02.651 --> 01:06:07.170
I can't wait for you guys to see you.
The next,
the secrets of off top,

1017
01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:10.840
that was him
for 99 per minute.

1018
01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:15.500
That was me right there for 99 per minute.
The gangster part,
it's free.
It's free.

1019
01:06:15.550 --> 01:06:19.920
It's free.
You know,
he could,
okay.
Now I listened to it.
I May,

1020
01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:22.950
maybe it was like my memory of all the different voices.
Yeah.

1021
01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:25.360
So maybe it's not him,
so maybe it's been narrator.

1022
01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:29.290
The narrator I definitely felt was west coast has shit though.
Yeah.
Okay.

1023
01:06:29.350 --> 01:06:34.150
Am I right?
Uh,
yeah.
I guess.
I Dunno.
I Dunno.
Yeah,
I dunno where I think he is.

1024
01:06:34.151 --> 01:06:38.920
Yeah.
You don't know.
I think he's,
I think he's west coast.
Yeah.

1025
01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:43.960
Okay.
I'll tell you more later.
Okay.
Say more later.
All right.

1026
01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:48.280
And this guy,
Leland,
I don't know where he's from originally.
Um,
he lives in,

1027
01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:49.900
he lives in California

1028
01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:56.260
medical medicine recently.
He's in the,
he's in the upcoming,

1029
01:06:56.261 --> 01:06:59.650
he's in the new one as well.
Leland Leland.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.

1030
01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:02.830
There's some other fun surprises too.
All right.
I mean,
this is all cheeses.

1031
01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:03.231
I know.

1032
01:07:03.231 --> 01:07:07.360
I'm just like watching the fucking ass on Hbo and that as Hardcore Right now.

1033
01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:10.260
Well,
I'll tell you more about it.
Okay.
So there's,
there's,
there's a new case,

1034
01:07:10.261 --> 01:07:12.880
the party line.
I will say when you see it,

1035
01:07:12.881 --> 01:07:16.660
it's going to seem like an overkill of gangster.
We'd felt idea was just,

1036
01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:20.080
it was going to be more gangs,
an excessive amount of gangsters this time.

1037
01:07:20.610 --> 01:07:25.300
More of a right.
Just more gangsters.
And it's like a lot.

1038
01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:29.130
All the roll out on your youtube channel.
No,
it's for um,

1039
01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:30.860
Kevin Hart's new,
uh,

1040
01:07:30.970 --> 01:07:34.390
digital network called laugh out loud network and a,

1041
01:07:34.391 --> 01:07:37.430
I think it's supposed to come out in August,
but um,

1042
01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:40.990
they will streamline the,
in other words,
it will be like one,

1043
01:07:40.991 --> 01:07:44.640
and I don't want to sure how they're going to release them exactly.
But I'll,

1044
01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:49.650
I'll probably promote them and I'm hoping that at one point I'll be able to

1045
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:54.350
share the director's cuts because those are the ones I wear.
My,

1046
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:57.610
the ones I would have wanted to go out,
but of course,

1047
01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:01.930
but the ones that they have or they're still good.
But you know,

1048
01:08:01.931 --> 01:08:05.830
there was things that we see it when they want us to take out or whatever.

1049
01:08:05.831 --> 01:08:07.060
And you know,

1050
01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:12.400
like they're the one that's coming out on the laugh out loud network is two

1051
01:08:12.401 --> 01:08:14.470
minutes long for the gangster party line.
The one,

1052
01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:17.690
the director's got three minutes.
So you're getting a whole,
you know,

1053
01:08:17.691 --> 01:08:21.140
there's a third missing from the wow.
But as the third,
is that a bummer?

1054
01:08:21.141 --> 01:08:26.000
I hate editing stuff down.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Um,
but anyway,
there's that.

1055
01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:27.740
So there's a gangster party like coming out,
Leland,

1056
01:08:27.741 --> 01:08:30.340
we'll be back and maybe some others too.

1057
01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:33.520
Mothers familiar faces and busy then then.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Those,

1058
01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:36.320
these hotline videos took up a lot of time this year.
It was like,

1059
01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:40.190
and congrats on doing that with the,
it looks like a production team behind you.

1060
01:08:40.250 --> 01:08:44.000
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
No,
it was a,
yeah.
You go pitch this idea to them.
Well,

1061
01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:48.770
they just really liked the original and um,
they,
they were,

1062
01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:51.520
they kind of pitched it to me in a way.
Well,
I,

1063
01:08:51.521 --> 01:08:56.030
I had ideas that were related to gangster party line and um,

1064
01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:57.900
like getting celebrities to answer the,

1065
01:08:57.950 --> 01:09:02.150
the line or maybe animating some of the voicemails and stuff or whatever.

1066
01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:05.420
And there they just said,
what about some other hotlines to other things?

1067
01:09:05.421 --> 01:09:09.890
I want to,
uh,
um,
you made this,
the dance was that,
that,
that short film.
Oh,

1068
01:09:09.891 --> 01:09:14.210
I don't dance.
I don't dance.
Can people see that I watched it on Vimeo.
Yeah.

1069
01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.420
Thanks for mentioning.
If you just Google that.
Yeah.

1070

Just go to my Vimeo page is vimeo.com/brent wine.
Barco Watch.

1071
01:09:20.361 --> 01:09:24.770
I don't dance and don't,
don't get impatient.
Don't it is 20 minutes.

1072
01:09:24.771 --> 01:09:26.870
You have to sit down short film.
Yeah.
It's a short film.

1073
01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:29.660
You have to sit down and take time.
They'll watch it.
Yeah.
I don't think,

1074
01:09:29.661 --> 01:09:33.380
I don't know if Christine has seen it.
I've seen it.
It's really great.
And,
um,

1075
01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:38.450
you know,
I know I spent a lot of time on it and we,
you know,

1076
01:09:38.451 --> 01:09:41.290
I hope I w I like people to and that as much,

1077
01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:44.510
I don't know if this is like a series.
Another thing you did was like,

1078
01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:49.900
when you're like the magician doing tricks on the street to come mind Jack Mine

1079
01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:52.010
Jackline Jazz.
Great.
Oh thanks.
Thanks.
Yeah.

1080
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:55.880
The new thing though that you're teasing.
How long is it?
Oh,

1081
01:09:55.881 --> 01:10:00.340
it's like a two minutes.
Two minutes.
Okay.
You guys should definitely watch it.
Um,

1082
01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:01.760
why don't we,
can we watch it right now?

1083
01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:03.740
Did you want to get into it now or did you oh yeah,

1084
01:10:03.741 --> 01:10:06.020
I was going to tell you some more about those other hotlines,
videos,

1085
01:10:06.021 --> 01:10:08.090
whatever you want.
If you want to know whatever you want,

1086
01:10:08.091 --> 01:10:11.000
I think it's exciting to play to that.
Why don't we have a debut,

1087
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:13.850
but let's get a video.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Now here's the thing.

1088
01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:18.020
I almost don't want you to even see the title of the video and I wonder if I

1089
01:10:18.021 --> 01:10:19.950
should pull it up and just full screen.

1090
01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:21.850
And so you don't know what the title is even,
um,

1091
01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:26.450
or do you want to know the title?
I just,
I think for simplicity,
just,
yeah,

1092
01:10:26.770 --> 01:10:30.980
yeah.
Yeah.
It probably be easier for me to,
he's typing.
Okay.
So,
uh,

1093
01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:33.890
let's go to the Vimeo.
Like,
cause there's a bunch of re uploads of it.

1094
01:10:33.891 --> 01:10:38.450
Like it was with a magic video.
Dot.
Yeah.
Brian.
Brian,

1095

Yeah.
This one's,
this one's like definitely kind of,

1098
01:10:52.530 --> 01:10:56.030
it's a little more hardcore,
so,
okay.
Watch it.
Hardcore is what we're all about.

1099
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:59.110
I've given birth so I don't,
I'm not screamed Dodo.

1100
01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.030
Y'All feel like it actually from that perspective,

01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:29.940
getting comfortable or uncomfortable with being my dad.
He's got his hog.

1107
01:11:29.941 --> 01:11:31.240
You can see this big painter.

1108
01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:36.800
Something was just inserted inside of them.

1109
01:11:38.770 --> 01:11:40.990
They're putting Vaseline on his deck right now.
Yeah.

1110
01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:44.083
<v 14>Okay.</v>

1111
01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:49.000
<v 4>Okay.
That's a close up of his penis.
That penis,</v>

1112
01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:53.470
he's pushing really hard,
like he's delivering birth.

1113
01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:57.040
Oh my.
Oh my God.

1114
01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:00.760
And there's something about to come out the head of his penis right now.

1115
01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:02.400
Oh.

1116

Struggling washout.
Whatever's in there.

1118
01:12:15.011 --> 01:12:16.270

Yeah.

1121
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:37.660

1122
01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:41.330

1130
01:13:05.450 --> 01:13:09.990
This is,
um,
God,
Brynne world's first ever man.

1131
01:13:09.991 --> 01:13:14.220
Birth successful.
Wow.
Thanks for that,
Brent.
Yeah.

1132
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:18.180
Thank you for funny.
There's historic brick.
Yeah,
there's a,

1133
01:13:18.190 --> 01:13:22.950
there's a context for that.
Why that says that.
But it was meant to be on the,

1134
01:13:23.090 --> 01:13:26.820
uh,
it was originally on the dark web and it was meant to seem like a red room

1135
01:13:26.821 --> 01:13:30.900
video.
Oh,
right.
And um,
wow.
It looks real.

1136
01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:34.770
That's very real.
Yeah.
No,
he went over,
there was a budget behind that.

1137
01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:38.190
I was going to say it was for TV show was it was for the Internet,

1138
01:13:38.191 --> 01:13:43.080
but for TV shows with the,
you know,
the,
the aspect of that.
Yeah.
Uh,

1139
01:13:43.081 --> 01:13:47.200
this girl,
this is a woman named Chloe.
I mean,
she did a phenomenal job.

1140
01:13:47.710 --> 01:13:52.170
Sends it does I think her last name?
Chloe sens.
Yeah.
She,
it was her first.

1141
01:13:52.171 --> 01:13:54.710
I just thought you bought a Dildo and I was like,
oh,

1142
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:58.410
they just have it like a fake dick there.
But when it starts moving and growing,

1143
01:13:58.411 --> 01:14:02.670
yeah,
no,
she did a great job and everybody involved was that Ryan's real dick.

1144
01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:07.630
I mean,
they do.
She did a great job with Ryan's plan.
Yeah.
That baby it loaded.

1145
01:14:07.650 --> 01:14:11.870
It took some,
took some exercise.
He just had a stretches,
you know,
he had,

1146
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.340
<v 12>he had a week of preparation of just,
uh,
you know,</v>

1147
01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:17.940
stretching his penis in and out.
Uh,
yeah.

1148
01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:21.460
He just had to let me ask you a question.
So,
um,
oh yeah,

1149
01:14:21.461 --> 01:14:24.790
please ask them what you ever date your mom?
Did you ever doubt your mom?

1150
01:14:26.230 --> 01:14:30.460
No,
not me.
You know,
I mean,
no,
and I know,

1151
01:14:30.490 --> 01:14:33.130
I think I know,
hey,
we're asking that,
but I wouldn't though.

1152
01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:37.780
You think you know how I'm asking it.
Let me give you some more context.

1153
01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:42.480
I'm your mom and you're my son and I if falling in love with him,

1154
01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:48.280
are you really?
I think
I was scared to let you know too.

1155
01:14:48.281 --> 01:14:52.750
I am too.
We're both consenting.
Adults hold up.
It comes down to it,
you know,

1156
01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:57.570
it's just like the gays there,
you know?
As long as they're all routine,

1157
01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:01.250
everything's fine.
All right.
I mean,
I,
I don't,
I don't,

1158
01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:06.070
I don't just prove that I'm okay with that,
but I mean,

1159
01:15:06.071 --> 01:15:08.770
I wouldn't do it.
There's a little bit,
by the way,
the context was,

1160
01:15:08.771 --> 01:15:11.650
would you date someone who wasn't related?
They were,
they were your mom,

1161
01:15:11.651 --> 01:15:15.060
but you're not related.
I thought that was the question,
biological guy.

1162
01:15:15.130 --> 01:15:17.490
Like I thought you were asking me if they were no me.

1163
01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:21.550
I mean like if they were exactly what they were exactly like your mom,

1164
01:15:21.551 --> 01:15:23.470
but you weren't actually related to them.
No.
No.

1165
01:15:23.710 --> 01:15:27.100
And I thought that's what you were asking.
What can I steal your real mom?
I just,

1166
01:15:27.130 --> 01:15:31.930
I wouldn't,
I,
I wouldn't date her,
you know?
Why is that?
Because,
um,

1167
01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:37.420
I,
you know,
she's just a,
I don't know.
There's just a different thing.
Yeah.
No,

1168
01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:41.590
no,
no,
no.
Again,
if I wasn't related to them,
I wouldn't date my dad either,

1169
01:15:41.591 --> 01:15:42.890
but yeah.

1170
01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:46.900
But this I approve of because,

1171
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:51.380
because I would date my biological mom.
No,
I'm just kidding.
I worked eight.
I,

1172
01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:55.230
I mean,
I just,
I,
you know,
whatever they could do what they want,
who cares?

1173
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:58.380
They're not,
you know,
they do what they want.
Of course.
It's like the gaze

1174
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:04.480
that is important to point out that the gays do what they want and so can

1175
01:16:04.481 --> 01:16:08.530
everyone else yeah.
As long as they're 18.
Yeah.
It's an important why,

1176
01:16:08.531 --> 01:16:11.570
why do they have to go to jail for 18 months?
Then they actually ended up,

1177
01:16:12.150 --> 01:16:15.140
they ended up getting arrested and everything.
Why that's not right.
Um,

1178
01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:20.140
I guess there are a great team that,
I mean the,
yeah,
they wanted to get married,

1179
01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:22.570
but he could,
he could technically fuck his mom.
What do you guys,

1180
01:16:22.571 --> 01:16:27.160
how do you guys feel?
I feel like it's gross,
but he,
if he wants to fuck his mom,

1181
01:16:27.161 --> 01:16:31.180
I don't care.
But if you start wanting to like have a marriage ceremony,

1182
01:16:31.181 --> 01:16:34.330
not that it,
it affects,
affects me in any way,

1183
01:16:34.570 --> 01:16:38.230
but that's where the legal system is going to jump in and be like,
no,
you can't.

1184
01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:42.070
And I think that's what would caught up to that.
I wonder why,
but why not?

1185
01:16:42.071 --> 01:16:44.050
But you know what though,
they don't even need to get married.

1186
01:16:44.051 --> 01:16:45.820
You know what I mean?
There are lots of stairs.

1187
01:16:45.970 --> 01:16:47.820
They didn't need to do this interview either,
you know,

1188
01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:52.660
but he could have just kept fucking his mom and he got,
they got,
they got off.

1189
01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:55.290
They didn't get in trouble for this.
They have very little.

1190
01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:58.750
Is there a law against it?
Yeah.
You can't marry your mom,
you know,

1191
01:16:58.751 --> 01:17:03.460
but can you have intercourse with,
I don't think legally.
I mean again,

1192
01:17:03.490 --> 01:17:06.940
you could do it,
but I think if you announce it is where somebody goes,

1193
01:17:06.970 --> 01:17:09.020
you can't fuck your mom.
They have,

1194
01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:12.590
they should have just fucked and then not like not told people.

1195
01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:17.350
Oh were they real public about it?
Yeah,
they have like pride.
Their,
their pride.

1196
01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:20.730
Pride,
pride.
LGBT.
Yeah.

1197
01:17:22.130 --> 01:17:26.690
Ms Ms or mess or sm there.
S and m.

1198
01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.420
Did they do SNM that's right.
Sudden Mom's right.

1199
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:32.300
Set amongst the definition of medicine is real.
That's the real

1200
01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:36.050
honest truth.
Yes,

1201
01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:40.400
I would because 19 years you're the best thing that ever happened to me and I

1202
01:17:40.401 --> 01:17:44.430
really want to be with the rest of my life.
I wonder how much older is she is

1203
01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:51.770
they both have cool face tat down.
I'm down for you.

1204
01:17:51.771 --> 01:17:55.460
I'm actually down for them straight up.
Really?
I'm John for a lot of things.
Yeah.

1205
01:17:55.780 --> 01:17:58.760
I mean I'm down for people to do a lot of things.

1206
01:17:58.761 --> 01:18:03.520
As long as it's not hurting anybody.
Yeah,
sure you are.

1207
01:18:03.930 --> 01:18:08.900
Who are you dating?
This girl named mom?
No,
I'm just kidding.
This,
this,

1208
01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:12.830
this,
this,
this,
this woman.
This young woman.

1209
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.890
I mean,
I don't know.
I mean,
what else is there?

1210
01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:25.220
Not a comedian.
Regular person.
That's good.
Got It.
Got It.

1211
01:18:25.221 --> 01:18:28.820
Got to keep it real.
Keep it real like you guys,

What about on the Americana?
You know,

1218
01:18:56.660 --> 01:18:58.250
what about the place where you ride the bull?

1219
01:18:58.430 --> 01:19:02.270
You were taking her there in San Diego?
No,

Saddle ranch.
Oh,

1220
01:19:02.271 --> 01:19:06.170
the Saddleback ranch.
They have a boulder go I to take her there,

1221
01:19:06.171 --> 01:19:10.290
We got to ride that bull together.
I want to meet.
It's like a bull made for too.

1222
01:19:10.330 --> 01:19:14.690
Are you guys tell us more about her off the air?
I,
yeah,
sure.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1223
01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:17.850
What else do you want to know?
What's up man?

1224
01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:22.130
Do you guys heart in front of each other?
No,
I don't.

1225
01:19:22.131 --> 01:19:26.090
I have farted in previous relationships,
but I don't,
not in this one.
Wow.

1226
01:19:26.091 --> 01:19:29.680
What's special about her that you just don't,
I don't want to do that.
I'm,

1227
01:19:29.681 --> 01:19:32.210
I'm getting,
you know,
you guys Fart,
right?
Hardcore

1228
01:19:34.930 --> 01:19:38.270
show entirely about farming.
But how many years in did you guys start farting?

1229
01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:43.070
Two months.
How many months
when I met you guys,
which wasn't,

1230
01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:46.010
it wasn't a month to,
you know what I remember why,
because I could,

1231
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:49.880
there's a couple things that I remember looking at him reminiscing.
I remember,

1232
01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:52.710
I remember the timeline here.
Here's how I remember.
Yeah,

1233
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.270
I start seeing you in late.
Um,

1234
01:19:56.480 --> 01:20:01.480
oh like I go out a couple of times to do an o four oh five oh four oh five I

1235
01:20:03.381 --> 01:20:08.310
know that I was dating you officially cause we shot cut in oh five I remember

1236
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:12.810
<v 4>that.
Right.
And I remembered that that fart happened in college football season.</v>

1237
01:20:12.970 --> 01:20:15.000
So it had to be at least September.
Right.

1238
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:19.090
<v 12>I don't know exactly why you're thinking all this.
I'm on board.</v>

1239
01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:21.280
2005 is when he's

1240
01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:25.940
<v 4>started dating.
Let's say January is like we're dating.
Oh,
okay.</v>

1241
01:20:25.941 --> 01:20:28.730
And then the first top part has in football season,
which is in the fall,

1242
01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:31.300
which is in the fall.
So I know it's at least nine months of fall apart.

1243
01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:36.440
Fall apart.
How you did it.
This is how I broke the fart barrier.

1244
01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:39.050
Are you ready?
Sure.
I spent the night at her place.

1245
01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:43.010
I remember that it's football season cause I was watching on her Shitty TV,

1246
01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:47.720
a college game in on a Saturday morning and I was sitting there in my boxers.

1247
01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:51.830
She sat next to me and I was like,
oh man.
And at this point,

1248
01:20:51.831 --> 01:20:56.030
you know we're definitely dating.
It's like,
you know,
you're in the mix.

1249
01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:56.780
We're in there.

1250
01:20:56.780 --> 01:21:01.470
We probably did it last night or this morning and now I'm just like chilling,

1251
01:21:01.471 --> 01:21:05.270
watching football.
And I go,
I feel this far coming and I just go for it.

1252
01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:09.680
But I grabbed her hand and I put it between my legs and I fart on her hand.

1253
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:15.300
<v 12>That's the first fart.
Whoa.
That is very bold.</v>

1254
01:21:15.301 --> 01:21:17.360
It's like all or nothing kind of thing.

1255
01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:21.650
<v 4>Part on her hand.
And she goes,
oh my God.
I said,
Mary,
she goes,</v>

1256
01:21:21.651 --> 01:21:24.740
it smells like garbage.
It smells like garbage.
And she ran into the other room.

1257
01:21:26.710 --> 01:21:29.710
<v 12>Oh yeah,
it did.
It smell like garbage.
I know those garbage farts.</v>

1258
01:21:29.711 --> 01:21:32.800
I don't do them myself,
but I have a friend,
I won't mention his name.

1259
01:21:32.801 --> 01:21:37.390
He is a comedian.
Um,
but it is,
yeah,
he has these,

1260
01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:42.420
we've talked about it on stage and does it really him?
It was,
yeah,
it is.
Well,

1261
01:21:42.421 --> 01:21:44.710
you know what,
it was more so in the past when he had a very,

1262
01:21:45.310 --> 01:21:50.310
it seems like he had a stricter vegan diet then he had that real calm posty kind

1263
01:21:51.521 --> 01:21:55.660
of,
you know,
it really,
it was this vegetarian,

1264
01:21:56.020 --> 01:22:00.340
these vegetarian farts are Vegan farts.
They're very,
uh,
they smell like garbage.

1265
01:22:00.341 --> 01:22:02.890
They still like real garbage.
Garbage.

1266
01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:07.700
<v 4>People should tweet them.
You should tweet them.
You should tweet.
Moesha um,</v>

1267
01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:08.620
I heard your bars.

1268
01:22:08.770 --> 01:22:12.970
<v 12>I feel,
I hope he doesn't get upset about me.
So man,
I'm not a big deal.
I mean,</v>

1269
01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:15.970
I said no,
when I said a big deal,
it's just that you could have been like,
no,

1270
01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:17.400
but you,
you know.

1271
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:23.290
So what did you think when you put your hand on the farm,

1272
01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:25.810
what did you think now in retrospect,

1273
01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:30.970
if I had high self esteem or like standards that were different,

1274
01:22:30.971 --> 01:22:33.850
I thought I probably wouldn't be like,
I gotta I gotta get out of this.
You know?

1275
01:22:33.930 --> 01:22:37.480
Yeah.
I think because back then I was like,
I'm a comedian,
I'm silly,

1276
01:22:37.481 --> 01:22:41.750
carefree person.
I would just kind of rolled with it.
Oh,
okay.
And I liked him.

1277
01:22:41.770 --> 01:22:45.550
So wait a second,
I'm out.

1278
01:22:46.650 --> 01:22:51.280
Like now that I'm older and kind of like looking for flags,

1279
01:22:51.281 --> 01:22:54.160
I think I was my guard,
my defenses were down.
Wow.

1280
01:22:54.370 --> 01:22:58.660
So you're saying if he farted on your hand now,
what would you have done?

1281
01:22:58.661 --> 01:23:01.740
Would you been like,
I'm out of get out of my,
but again,
it's not date.

1282
01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:06.280
<v 4>This is like nine months plus we were before we dated,</v>

1283
01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:09.090
<v 12>so I knew that he was going to do that.
He farted back,</v>

1284
01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:12.430
but you gotta get it done now.
This could have been a point.

1285
01:23:12.431 --> 01:23:15.970
You could have said something like maybe if it was,
if you rewind back,

1286
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.010
if you had been like,
hey,
just so you know,

1287
01:23:18.250 --> 01:23:22.120
I really don't ever want to do like I'm not good with that.

1288
01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:23.980
That could have established some boundaries.

1289
01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:26.520
That's the thing is that I could have established boundaries.

1290
01:23:26.521 --> 01:23:29.470
It could have been like,
uh,
how was you felt?

1291
01:23:30.490 --> 01:23:34.860
Did Not react to that.
Yeah.
What would you like positive way,
you know,

1292
01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:40.460
you laughed I guess.
And truth be told,
I'm glad we have open fart policy.

1293
01:23:44.370 --> 01:23:49.370
Farted on each others face like as a joke or not as a joke in our son's face to

1294
01:23:50.790 --> 01:23:55.270
in front of my son's face today.
Well I was facing,
I was at the counter,

1295
01:23:55.570 --> 01:24:00.190
I was at the counter and he walked up behind me and I felt his head nudge.

1296
01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:03.900
His height is like right at my butt cheeks and I had a far,

1297
01:24:03.901 --> 01:24:07.600
so I just let it go to like joke with him.

1298
01:24:08.350 --> 01:24:12.690
Did he laugh?
I don't know.
He was just like,
he was like,
did he smell it?

1299
01:24:13.570 --> 01:24:18.080
It smelled bad.
I don't know.
It wasn't a crazy fart.
It was just

1300
01:24:19.790 --> 01:24:24.340
no,
what now?
Do you remember her first part?
No,
I don't remember.

1301
01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:25.420
I don't remember the first one.

1302
01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:28.300
I think I stole too much thunder with mine for my memory.

1303
01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.980
But then I was thankful that we had broken that.

1304
01:24:33.290 --> 01:24:37.060
How do you hide that in a relationship with somebody?
Well,
there's still a thing.

1305
01:24:37.061 --> 01:24:40.510
I mean,
I think it's not just,
just because he farted her in a hand.

1306
01:24:40.511 --> 01:24:44.170
I think that doesn't necessarily,
I mean,
you know,
make a,

1307
01:24:44.410 --> 01:24:48.100
create a safe space for you to far yet because sir,
no,
because of,
you know,

1308
01:24:48.101 --> 01:24:52.060
there's these,
there's these gender issues about like,
you know,

1309
01:24:52.090 --> 01:24:55.860
guys can fart on hands,
but you know,
girls can't farm guy.

1310
01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:58.500
And I'm like,
I'm a guy.
I don't know.

1311
01:24:58.510 --> 01:25:03.130
I didn't know if you had a different pronoun or whatever.
Yeah,
yeah,
sure.
Yeah.
No,

1312
01:25:03.190 --> 01:25:07.230
I mean it wasn't like farting.
I actually enjoy it and it's fine.
So it was good.

1313
01:25:07.330 --> 01:25:10.750
Yeah.
Uh,
and uh,
you know,
and by the way,

1314
01:25:10.751 --> 01:25:15.610
you guys started dating in 2005,
right?
Yeah.
And I met you guys in 2007.
Yes,

1315
01:25:16.090 --> 01:25:20.320
oftentimes there's in September,
2007 so it's been just about 10 years.

1316
01:25:21.070 --> 01:25:24.900
10 year anniversary.
She kept studying together.
Yeah.
It's so much fun with you.

1317
01:25:25.170 --> 01:25:27.340
We went to a museum,
we went to,

1318
01:25:27.341 --> 01:25:30.220
we went to the Capitol Capitol

1319
01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:35.140
Capitol.
I think that's where it was.
It wasn't a museum.

1320
01:25:35.141 --> 01:25:39.070
It was a capital and it was,
we saw a painting of George Bush.
Yeah,

1321
01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:43.570
I remember that.
Yeah.
That was fun.
That was French.

1322
01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:47.110
Yeah.
And your pants were open.
My parents

1323
01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:52.180
ever do things like that on the road since like that's probably the only time

1324
01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:56.170
I did cap city with you.

1325
01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:00.390
They booked me the next year to headline it.
Yeah.

1326
01:26:00.610 --> 01:26:03.410
And then he didn't book me again for like five years.
Oh really?
Yeah.

1327
01:26:03.411 --> 01:26:04.190
And I was like,
why can't

1328
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:08.790
<v 13>I was,
I was doing that club regularly for a little while and then uh,
you know,</v>

1329
01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:10.970
stop doing it.
But do you still work the road at all?

1330
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:15.260
I don't like to do club weeks anymore,
you know?
Yeah.
And I have it.

1331
01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:17.410
I don't understand why.
Cause it's always well,
yeah.
No,

1332
01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:20.340
I prefer to just get everyone coming in.
Yeah,
exactly.
Of course I do.

1333
01:26:20.341 --> 01:26:24.070
You remember the one show we had?
Uh,
there was one really bad show.
That one.
Yeah,

1334
01:26:24.770 --> 01:26:29.690
you did fine,
but it was a packed crowd.
There was a game the next day I guess.

1335
01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:32.990
And people weren't town for the game.
I think I made a college game.

1336
01:26:33.050 --> 01:26:34.160
I have to give you a lot of credit.

1337
01:26:34.510 --> 01:26:37.010
I have to give you a lot of credit because you did this thing where like you

1338
01:26:37.011 --> 01:26:42.011
were an wavering with your set like you did well.

1339
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:46.570
You got to commit.
Well yeah.
You did what you had say people were leaving.
Yeah.

1340
01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:51.640
Like throughout the show cause and not just leaving but leaving in anger like so

1341
01:26:52.941 --> 01:26:57.260
angry and I was like,
man,
this is fucking on comfortable.
Yeah.

1342
01:26:57.261 --> 01:26:59.420
I think it was the Friday early show.
It might've been.

1343
01:26:59.421 --> 01:27:03.200
It was the fullest show of the week.
Yeah.
It was totally packed.
Sold out I think.

1344
01:27:03.650 --> 01:27:05.390
And for the whole 45 minutes.

1345
01:27:05.391 --> 01:27:09.730
You know what's interesting is like so many people that were like not into this

1346
01:27:09.731 --> 01:27:11.660
show.
Let's say half of them were like,

1347
01:27:11.661 --> 01:27:16.340
just the fuck the one guy left.
I remember it cause I was in uh,

1348
01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:18.560
in the lobby.
He goes,
that guy's an asshole.

1349
01:27:18.910 --> 01:27:22.040
Like he was angry about his set,
which,

1350
01:27:22.041 --> 01:27:24.920
and not even at like he's provoking him.

1351
01:27:24.921 --> 01:27:28.010
Like you weren't like saying something to,
to anger him.

1352
01:27:28.011 --> 01:27:30.810
He was just upset about it.
You did your,

1353
01:27:31.190 --> 01:27:33.650
the next day you did the exact like,
you know,

1354
01:27:33.710 --> 01:27:38.390
the same set and you killed.
Yeah.
And it was all the rest of the week was fine.

1355
01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:38.830
Yeah.

1356
01:27:38.830 --> 01:27:42.620
But I meant like the like what I remember it was like the VA like who knows what

1357
01:27:42.621 --> 01:27:47.040
will happen.
Saturday early show was still a full,
full,
pretty full house.
Yeah.

1358
01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:49.730
Did the same thing.
It just,
that,
that was just remember that one,

1359
01:27:49.731 --> 01:27:53.300
just that one show and I do recall you're doing fine.

1360
01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:57.500
I think are doing well,
you know,
and uh,
and yeah,

1361
01:27:57.501 --> 01:27:59.730
actually I'm almost certain you did very well.
He probably,

1362
01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:03.600
I think you probably killed,
which didn't hurt help me,
but well for that,

1363
01:28:03.601 --> 01:28:06.590
you know,
who was to know that that show was going to be such a bad show for me.

1364
01:28:06.591 --> 01:28:08.600
But yeah,
there were walkouts definitely.

1365
01:28:08.601 --> 01:28:10.430
Like at least a third of the crowd walked out.

1366
01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:14.570
But it's so funny that you know that people can get upset at different things

1367
01:28:14.571 --> 01:28:19.190
because you weren't like,
uh,
you know,
fuck your way of thinking.

1368
01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:21.520
I never,
I,
I don't want to be a fan.

1369
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:24.530
I never named to be an offensive comedian actually.

1370
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.020
<v 5>Interesting how,</v>

1371
01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:28.960
first of all it was a wonderful lesson cause I was there for that show and I was

1372
01:28:28.961 --> 01:28:30.610
just like dipping my toe into being a,

1373
01:28:30.670 --> 01:28:35.530
being a feature act and the watch you commit and really be like,
Nope,

1374
01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:36.400
this is the act.

1375
01:28:36.430 --> 01:28:39.550
And I know as a first time I'd seen anybody really do that and I was like,

1376
01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:40.780
that's fucking awesome.

1377
01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:45.640
And it just goes to show how different audiences are our suck.
Like,

1378
01:28:45.730 --> 01:28:47.740
yeah,
like you said the next night,

1379
01:28:47.770 --> 01:28:52.690
it was fantastic and you killed it and then just this particular audience is not

1380
01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:56.650
into it and has nothing to do with you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And they were like,

1381
01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:59.850
you know what's funny is that they were angry.
Like a lot of that,

1382
01:28:59.851 --> 01:29:02.130
I can't speak for all of them.
A lot of them were angry

1383
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:06.780
<v 13>at his commitment to what he was doing.
They weren't mad at like,</v>

1384
01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:10.290
you know,
you said I'm gonna take your guns away.
Or like it wasn't like,

1385
01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:14.800
oh politics.
They were just mad at like,
he's still doing this.

1386
01:29:14.801 --> 01:29:16.180
So funny still doing it.

1387
01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:21.700
And yet I recall I actually somehow sold a tee shirt that show for some reason

1388
01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:27.330
someone bought a tee shirt and then the next show or maybe the next night had a

1389
01:29:27.331 --> 01:29:29.130
really strong staff and it didn't it all by,

1390
01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:31.080
it was more not anything that fuck with you at all.

1391
01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:35.190
Like when you're sitting in your hotel room.
That set did make me think,
could I,

1392
01:29:35.191 --> 01:29:39.600
at that point I thought I had a good headlining set that was kind of full proof,

1393
01:29:39.630 --> 01:29:43.920
you know?
And then that made me think,
oh,
I guess it's not foolproof,
you know,

1394
01:29:43.921 --> 01:29:45.270
or something.
And I was,
I thought,

1395
01:29:45.450 --> 01:29:48.720
and I'm always strive to try to actually make a great set that,

1396
01:29:48.810 --> 01:29:53.400
that I do feel there's a responsibility when headlining a show to do a good job,

1397
01:29:53.401 --> 01:29:58.110
you know,
it was one of the worst reactions I've ever seen to a headlining set.

1398
01:29:58.380 --> 01:29:59.580
Do you know whose was worse?

1399
01:30:00.210 --> 01:30:04.110
Mine because I got booed off stage a few years later.
I,

1400
01:30:04.170 --> 01:30:06.450
well I not a headlining set.
I've got,

1401
01:30:06.451 --> 01:30:10.800
I've got booed off stage when I was opening.
And you have like in the more,

1402
01:30:10.801 --> 01:30:15.760
in the past before that you thought about your set?
When I was a bombing.
So wait,

1403
01:30:15.761 --> 01:30:18.360
hold on,
hold on.
Let's,
sorry,
I don't mean it to take that away.

1404
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:23.390
You've got booed as a headlining sets where Winnepeg when a few years ago,

1405
01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:28.620
really few years ago.
Where are you getting political or something?
Um,
no,

1406
01:30:28.650 --> 01:30:31.140
I uh,
what did you do?
You fart on someone's hand.

1407
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:35.130
I just talked shit to somebody early on who was talking.
Okay.

1408
01:30:35.131 --> 01:30:39.960
So it was because of a heckler incident or something.
Interesting.
It unraveled.

1409
01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:40.710
Wow.

1410
01:30:40.710 --> 01:30:45.710
But I'm saying I tried to go into the act basically like,

1411
01:30:46.770 --> 01:30:50.040
hey,
why don't you shut the fuck up and then go back to doing stand up.

1412
01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:54.930
And they were just,
they just,
wow.
How did that make you feel?

1413
01:30:54.931 --> 01:30:58.560
Actually that was just a few years ago.
That was crazy,
man.
That was nuts.

1414
01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:02.730
I really did think about your set.
Oh really?
Yes.

1415
01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:07.020
Because I remembered like doing things like act,
I would,
I was like,

1416
01:31:07.050 --> 01:31:11.550
I would act like the room wasn't falling apart.
It was falling apart.

1417
01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:14.430
Like screaming.
People were like,
yeah.
And I would be like,

1418
01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:18.420
so the other day and you just hear murmuring and talking and stuff.

1419
01:31:18.450 --> 01:31:22.290
I would try to do,
cause I,
yeah,
it's very hard to focus.
Yeah.

1420
01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:25.290
I was saying like it's crazy sense.
No,
I've had some set,

1421
01:31:25.291 --> 01:31:30.060
some sets like that where it's just,
I mean it's actually pretty like seldom,

1422
01:31:30.061 --> 01:31:34.260
you know?
I mean I've only like,
I can count how many
one hand,

1423
01:31:34.261 --> 01:31:38.610
but like sets where you're,
you have to do full hour and you're like trying to,

1424
01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:42.840
you know,
you're just hearing people talking or just,
it's so weird.

1425
01:31:42.841 --> 01:31:46.200
It's such a surreal thing.
So hard.
You almost think that that doesn't happen,

1426
01:31:46.201 --> 01:31:49.890
you know?
But it does.
And you know what can be like the,
for me,

1427
01:31:49.891 --> 01:31:51.990
like this is separate let's say from,

1428
01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:56.130
we're talking about like catastrophic stuff,
but like when you're,

1429
01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:59.560
let's say 99% of the room is,
is good and you're doing your,
you're

1430
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:02.440
<v 4>talking about something and you hear one table,</v>

1431
01:32:02.441 --> 01:32:06.010
like what if we go over it over to Jennifer is later and then I'll pick her up

1432
01:32:06.011 --> 01:32:09.220
and then we can pick up and you start hearing that.
Yeah.
And you're like,

1433
01:32:09.221 --> 01:32:11.510
your train of thought really annoying.
You want to go like,
hey man.

1434
01:32:12.010 --> 01:32:14.260
And then they're like,
well,
I'm just like saying something.
You're like,
I know,

1435
01:32:14.261 --> 01:32:18.550
but I can't hear my own thoughts because I keep hearing you talk about going to

1436
01:32:18.551 --> 01:32:22.540
Jennifer.
Totally,
totally.
It's,
yeah,
it's really just a huge distraction.
Yeah.

1437
01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:25.870
But you guys know,
just do you just do like one night somewhere,
right?

1438
01:32:26.110 --> 01:32:26.980
A lot of times.
Yeah.

1439
01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:30.940
I mean that's what I try to do now is just do one night in the city.

1440
01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:34.930
We have all the fans coming to one of the yeah,
that's the way to go.

1441
01:32:35.050 --> 01:32:36.130
Where are you going anywhere?

1442
01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:40.930
<v 12>Uh,
no,
I don't have anything major coming up.
I mean,
yeah.
No,</v>

1443
01:32:40.931 --> 01:32:43.630
nothing major coming up.
But,

1444
01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:46.020
<v 4>let's see.
Let's show Brent.

1445
01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:50.030
let's see if he's interested in eating a bowl of something.
Okay.

1446
01:32:52.670 --> 01:32:54.330
We'll see if,
uh,
you want to come over later?

1447
01:32:55.110 --> 01:32:56.830
<v 1>I think this is Charlie honey.

<v 1>Oh.</v>

1458
01:33:34.590 --> 01:33:39.080
Dirty son of a calm down layer for myself,

1459
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:45.860
<v 4>for moose soup.
Moose.
It.
What do you think that lady looks like?
Yeah.</v>

1460
01:33:45.861 --> 01:33:46.420
Describe her.

1461
01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:50.960
<v 12>Oh,
you didn't give was a lady.
I thought it was a man.
That guy first year voice.</v>

1462
01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:53.560
No.
Yeah,
I thought that was a man.
I know you did.

1463
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:57.580
I swear I thought that was a man.
Really?
Yeah.
You didn't have really,

1464
01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:01.120
it's definitely a woman.
No,
I think it's a man actually listen to the voice.

1465
01:34:03.190 --> 01:34:08.110
<v 1>Yeah.
You guys come down here after I got moved soup and everything.
Yeah,</v>

1466
01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:12.730
no.
Right.
You guys are doing good.
Wait.
Okay.

1467
01:34:12.731 --> 01:34:15.970
I guess now that you're mentioning you on video

1468
01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:19.550
<v 12>that it's a woman seeing it now as a woman I guess.</v>

1469
01:34:19.551 --> 01:34:23.220
But I was thinking a man the whole time.
That was some man.
Yeah.
Some guy,

1470
01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:24.130
some guy.

1471
01:34:24.130 --> 01:34:27.610
<v 4>Interesting take.
I mean look,
we're open to non binaries.
That's true.
I mean,</v>

1472
01:34:27.611 --> 01:34:31.570
did you picture a pronoun a healthy man or no?

1473
01:34:32.330 --> 01:34:32.820
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1474
01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:36.300
<v 12>No,
no I didn't.
He wasn't healthy.</v>

1475
01:34:37.610 --> 01:34:41.700
You know,
I thought of him as Kinda thick,
you know,
kind of,

1476
01:34:42.630 --> 01:34:47.520
kind of scraggly,
scraggly,
thick,
scraggly thick,
you know,
you know,
kind of Wa.

1477
01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:52.340
Yeah.
It kinda messy.
You know,
kind of sloppy,
sloppy,
thick.
Yeah.

1478
01:34:52.450 --> 01:34:56.190
These beaten all that Moose suit.
Yeah.
Right here.
That moves kind of smooth.

1479
01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:59.250
Soup says soupy look.
Moosey Luke Blue Look.

1480
01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:08.160
<v 17>Oh,
there's more,
wait,
hold on.
Back Up.
Yeah.
Is this somebody you know?
No.
Okay.</v>

1481
01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:13.610
<v 12>I should though.
I like her.
I mean we,
we assumed big tits.</v>

1482
01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:18.530
Lots of has had lots of sex.
Lots of cigarette.

1483
01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:23.450
Yeah.
But mostly cigarettes.
Cigarettes for sure.
Yeah.

1484
01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.870
You know what?
Never mind.
It kind of reminds me of,

1485
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.710
is that that Rhubarb Rhubarb Lady?
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1486
01:35:30.711 --> 01:35:34.070
We played her stealing the rhubarb.
Yeah.
She sounds like that.

1487
01:35:34.230 --> 01:35:37.160
You remember the Rhubarb Lady?
I don't remember the rhubarb laid out.
No,

1488
01:35:37.230 --> 01:35:41.360
I would say that on this show years ago.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's an old clip.

1489
01:35:41.430 --> 01:35:42.500
It's an old viral clip.

1490
01:35:42.750 --> 01:35:47.360
This lady was stealing rhubarb and sounds very similar to that,

1491
01:35:47.361 --> 01:35:49.130
but although her voice is higher pitch,

1492
01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:53.130
and I guess that's why I thought it was my man.
A man I thought was just

1493
01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:55.440
<v 18>pitch man.
Fucking hell.
Somebody,</v>

1494
01:35:58.010 --> 01:36:02.780
why don't you take some,
grow your home.
Now you're fucking property.

1495
01:36:02.781 --> 01:36:05.820
Go somewhere else.
Right.

1496
01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:13.230
And everybody's fucking visit,
visit,

1497
01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:18.470
whatever the bitch
name on it.
Please.
Your name

1498
01:36:19.810 --> 01:36:22.770
<v 12>sound like an angry or a version of what?
This side of yeah,</v>

1499
01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:25.650
that's a little younger.
Yeah,
it's a younger,
so what I'm saying?
No,

1500
01:36:25.651 --> 01:36:28.810
that's the female voice.
Then the other one is the,
uh,

1501
01:36:30.330 --> 01:36:33.870
you know why?
Because this is Trish as a young Trish

1502
01:36:34.290 --> 01:36:35.560
<v 17>distro shout or per month.</v>

1503
01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:41.310
<v 12>Oh yeah.
It's a mature as mature blossom.
That's true.</v>

1504
01:36:41.311 --> 01:36:44.330
Voice got deeper with the cigarettes too.
And it's like,

1505
01:36:44.570 --> 01:36:48.620
it's like she hit puberty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Something like that one.
That was like,

1506
01:36:49.410 --> 01:36:54.000
that was a young,
that was the young one.
Yeah.
Um,
but uh,

1507
01:36:54.450 --> 01:36:57.480
man,
I'm why glad you guys fart though,

That's good.

That's how we like to Fart.

1509
01:37:00.150 --> 01:37:02.520
I can't believe you have a girlfriend two years now.
Yeah.

1510
01:37:02.530 --> 01:37:05.940
That's how infrequently I see you.
Yeah.
Well I,

1511
01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:10.660

God,

1516
01:37:25.831 --> 01:37:30.030
Dad,

You grabbed my hand.

1517

You farted on it.
Yeah.
Brand.
Do you think you'll ever get married or you,

1518
01:37:33.751 --> 01:37:36.890
the marrying kind of would like to,
I'd like to have a family.
I'd like to be,

1520
01:37:40.861 --> 01:37:44.010
You have your starting a family.
I don't know if you're trying to go for another,

1521
01:37:44.011 --> 01:37:48.750
but you know and you've got to have a house here.
I have a suburban area.

1522
01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:52.240
Not under the dogs.
We saw it.
Yeah.
No,
I don't do that.
The animals.

1523
01:37:53.330 --> 01:37:56.700
Nah,
Nah,
Nah.
Don't fuck with them.
Nah,

1524
01:37:57.690 --> 01:38:00.690
that's not for me.
You know what I love about you and your act by the way,

1525
01:38:00.691 --> 01:38:04.260
he has a special,
what's the name of your special on appealing to the mainstream?

1526
01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:05.280
Appealing to the mainstream.

1527
01:38:05.490 --> 01:38:10.490
And you have this great bit about being a teacher in Oakland and the black

1528
01:38:11.101 --> 01:38:15.660
students call you mister pants.
I don't,
I don't specify that they're black,

1529
01:38:15.661 --> 01:38:19.950
but they sound,
you could say they could be,
they could be white,

1530
01:38:19.951 --> 01:38:24.870
they could be Indian.
That's true.
Urbanites there's just Oakland kids,

1531
01:38:24.871 --> 01:38:27.630
you know,
pants could be,
hey,
look,

1532
01:38:27.631 --> 01:38:30.720
grant granted definitely there were a lot of black kids that I substitute taught

1533
01:38:30.721 --> 01:38:32.350
one.
Oh really,
really crazy.

1534
01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:38.240
There were Indians to Indians.
That's a crazy job.
That's,

1535
01:38:38.250 --> 01:38:42.600
that's gotta be.
Yeah.
No,
they were,
they were.
Yeah,
they were tough kids.
They were,

1536
01:38:42.690 --> 01:38:46.380
I mean,
it was tough.
It was,
it,
uh,
made me a tough person.

1537
01:38:46.410 --> 01:38:49.230
Kind of made me a better comedian actually.
Right.
Yeah,
for sure.

1538
01:38:51.090 --> 01:38:53.220
Actually,
a lot of the stuff in that special,

1539
01:38:54.030 --> 01:38:59.030
a lot of it's older material and a lot of that stuff I was doing that week that

1540
01:38:59.041 --> 01:39:01.830
we met in Austin,
you know?
Yeah.

1541
01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:09.110
You from California,
can you tell?
Oh,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's,

1542
01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:13.380
yeah,
me all three.

1543
01:39:16.130 --> 01:39:20.580
Like your black voices on fleek?
I would say.
Yeah.
I mean,
I guess,
thank you.

1544
01:39:20.581 --> 01:39:23.740
I mean,
I don't,
I don't necessarily,
uh,

1545
01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:28.770
you think they sound black specifically?
I'd say you do a really good black dude.

1546
01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:30.060
Wait,

1547
01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:34.530
you're trying to suggest that anyone would believe that then it's the pants.

1548
01:39:34.531 --> 01:39:39.270
Kids are not black.
Well,
they might not be,
you know,
they could be,

1549
01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:43.990
it could be anything.
It could just be there's just urbanites Indians.

1550
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:49.400
Okay.
No

1551
01:39:52.050 --> 01:39:56.950
talking,
not black.
It's really funny.
I would love for people to,
well,

1552
01:39:56.951 --> 01:40:01.140
here's the thing,
but the special is there is no,

1553
01:40:01.141 --> 01:40:02.730
this is kind of like not even on a,

1554
01:40:03.870 --> 01:40:08.820
I think you can get something out of it that you get more if you pay close

1555
01:40:08.821 --> 01:40:13.710
attention.
I think there's more to get out of it than just the laughs.
Oh Geez.

1556
01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:18.120
I don't know what to,
I don't know.
I just,
I don't want to say much more,

1557
01:40:18.121 --> 01:40:22.890
but just that's the thing is if you embraced it,
embrace it fully,

1558
01:40:22.891 --> 01:40:25.080
and I think those,
there's more to it than I think.

1559
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:31.380
I think you're very layered and,
and I think that's accurate.

1560
01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:35.790
I want people to,
I just feel like people haven't been,

1561
01:40:36.330 --> 01:40:40.620
I haven't really heard much talk of,
uh,
the,

1562
01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:42.900
what you can get out of it.
There's more to get out of it.

1563
01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:48.330
I don't want to much more,
more teasing I think on Seeso.
Yeah.

1564
01:40:48.630 --> 01:40:53.380
And we'll see.
Hopefully appealing to the mainstream CSO.
Yeah,
that's what I mean.

1565
01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:54.030
That's how I do

1566
01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:57.790
<v 19>it,
man.
This is a healthy way,
if me is way more how they use in the backwoods,</v>

1567
01:40:57.791 --> 01:41:00.340
the White House,
the Garcia,
beggars,
you know what I mean?

1568
01:41:00.370 --> 01:41:04.050
All that type of shit that join the broad life man for,
for me,

1569
01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:07.220
we're trying to get you out of the environment.
That's all we smoking for now.

1570
01:41:07.230 --> 01:41:09.670
Almost gonna be number rocky for me now.
I would dabble in the,

1571
01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:12.130
you know what I mean?
And the swishes and shit like that,
you know,

1572
01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:14.620
every once in a while you coming to spice it up a little bit,

1573
01:41:14.621 --> 01:41:16.940
cause you already know,
you know what I mean?
Just switch a girl.
You feel me?

1574
01:41:16.941 --> 01:41:18.900
You got to spice it up a little bit.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

1575
01:41:19.210 --> 01:41:21.580
You gotta be willing to go out of your comfort zone.
So you know what I mean?

1576
01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:24.670
And pressure girl and pressed the mother fucking galaxy.
You feel me?

1577
01:41:24.671 --> 01:41:25.570
So I got a smoke blunt

1578
01:41:26.010 --> 01:41:29.320
<v 4>so I feel like he hit you feel me?
Definitely not.</v>

1579
01:41:29.790 --> 01:41:32.390
Maybe you know what I'm saying that I missed,
but you know what I mean?

1580
01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:37.030
Hit the TRIFECTA.
Is West Coast?
Um,
yeah,
yeah.

1581
01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:39.430
West Coast Guy.
Yeah.

1582
01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:42.570
<v 12>What's the deal?
What's the,
I guess I could,
I could hear that.</v>

1583
01:41:44.210 --> 01:41:48.770
I can hear the east coast accent when I hear urban voices,

1584
01:41:48.771 --> 01:41:49.910
I can hear the east coast,

1585
01:41:50.570 --> 01:41:54.940
but I guess maybe because I'm from the west coast,
maybe that's it.
I,

1586
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:55.730
it sounds just

1587
01:41:55.730 --> 01:41:58.700
<v 4>core once when,
when the way that like Carla said,</v>

1588
01:41:58.830 --> 01:42:02.400
<v 12>oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh,
very like distinct.
Oh,</v>

1589
01:42:02.401 --> 01:42:06.090
so when they say like upper here,
you know her,
you know,

1590
01:42:06.091 --> 01:42:10.500
and they say here her like,
do you think that is the Westcott her would be like,

1591
01:42:10.530 --> 01:42:14.320
that's like a southern,
southern that southern or something.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1592
01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:17.700
I really want to get,
I want to see you guys.

1593
01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:22.060
I'll show it to you guys after the recording,
the new hotline videos.
Oh really?

1594
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:26.300
Cool.
Vietnam you have them?
I have access to.
Yeah.
Okay.
Um,
yeah,

1595
01:42:26.370 --> 01:42:30.630
one of them is like a,
one of them is that you can call different dads and uh,

1596
01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:34.830
like if you're looking like if you need discipline or you need advice,
you know,

1597
01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:39.580
it's like a dad hotline,
you know?
Um,
and another one is this,
oh,

1598
01:42:39.630 --> 01:42:42.760
this one's a hunk hotline.
It's for ladies only if you want to call it.

1599
01:42:44.030 --> 01:42:45.780
But that's all I'll say.
But there's more to it than that.

1600
01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:49.140
<v 4>I feel like.
I feel like,
you know those,
the,
the,</v>

1601
01:42:49.141 --> 01:42:52.690
that California Lingo and you're saying that you like,
you're like,
I don't know

1602
01:42:52.750 --> 01:42:53.800
<v 12>for registered.
No,</v>

1603
01:42:53.801 --> 01:42:58.570
what I'm saying is that I can't distinguish that if their west coast,

1604
01:42:58.571 --> 01:43:00.710
because I'm,
I guess because that's normal.

1605
01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:05.110
Like that just sounds normal where it jumps out to me more if it's east coast or

1606
01:43:05.111 --> 01:43:05.910
southern,
I guess.

1607
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:08.670
<v 4>You know,
I had noticed when I was in Miami,
it was funny,</v>

1608
01:43:08.671 --> 01:43:11.690
it was like they have such a distinct accent.
Locals.
Oh,

1609
01:43:12.150 --> 01:43:16.410
locals just speaking English like no,
regardless of that,
they,

1610
01:43:16.650 --> 01:43:21.540
they basically sound like they learned English after they learned another

1611
01:43:21.541 --> 01:43:24.310
language.
Um,
you know,
a huge obvious Spanish,

1612
01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:30.260
but these are non bilingual people speaking English.
That's funny.
And so,

1613
01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:33.690
and you're like,
your accent's crazy.
And they're like,
what accent?
Like what?

1614
01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:35.760
They go,
you have an accent.
And I go,

1615
01:43:35.850 --> 01:43:40.620
I have a pretty nondescript accent when I speak.
And they were like,

1616
01:43:40.650 --> 01:43:43.080
oh no,
your accent is heavy.
I'm like,
wow.

1617
01:43:43.210 --> 01:43:45.670
<v 12>Yeah.
It's the same idea so much.</v>

1618
01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:49.060
Well there's also people who there's like,
you know,

1619
01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:52.640
Hispanic people in Los Angeles who speak Spanish,

1620
01:43:52.641 --> 01:43:56.080
but they do have some kind of accent that is,

1621
01:43:56.081 --> 01:43:58.760
that sounds like a Hispanic accent.
Right,
right,
right.

1622
01:43:58.761 --> 01:44:02.660
I don't even speak Spanish dog.
Yeah.
Or something.
You know,
cause they,

1623
01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:04.570
it's just a,
or the,

1624
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:08.510
I remember in San Francisco there's people who have Chinese accidents,

1625
01:44:08.511 --> 01:44:13.030
but they're from,
I dunno,
maybe they do you speak Chinese,
but they were,
they,

1626
01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:16.130
they were from San Francisco,
born and raised and they've got an accent.

1627
01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:20.680
<v 4>There was a dude in Hong Kong who lives there now who was raised,</v>

1628
01:44:21.310 --> 01:44:24.190
he was born and raised in New York City,

1629
01:44:24.370 --> 01:44:27.610
but in like a hardcore,
you know,

1630
01:44:27.940 --> 01:44:29.770
insulated Chinatown neighborhood.

1631
01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:34.810
So he speaks English with a heavy,
heavy accent.
Yeah.

1632
01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:38.280
And his Cantonese is just,
okay.
Ah,
yeah.
Right,
exactly.
He's like,

1633
01:44:38.380 --> 01:44:42.570
his primary language is English,
but it's,
it's,

1634
01:44:42.820 --> 01:44:46.500
I mean when you hear him speak,
you'd be like,
you would be like,
oh,
you know,

1635
01:44:46.501 --> 01:44:48.490
you would like all this guy learned English.

1636
01:44:49.290 --> 01:44:53.670
<v 5>Do you remember when we were at that restaurant and we saw that white guy at</v>

1637
01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:55.570
that Chinese wedding?
Yes.

1638
01:44:55.690 --> 01:44:59.560
It's like fully spittin like real dog Chinese.

1639
01:44:59.561 --> 01:45:01.270
And even had like the posturing,

1640
01:45:01.271 --> 01:45:04.440
like he was talking to like five older Chinese guys,
like,
you know,
though,

1641
01:45:04.450 --> 01:45:05.890
the total posturing and right.

1642
01:45:05.950 --> 01:45:10.950
This kid was like 30 and he mannerisms accent like totally down.

1643
01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:14.300
Rad.

1644
01:45:14.300 --> 01:45:16.610
<v 12>Well,
I went to China a couple of years ago and uh,</v>

1645
01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:21.170
met up with this guy who was like that as a white guy from Seattle.

1646
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:25.340
And when he started talking Chinese,
it was like,

1647
01:45:25.550 --> 01:45:28.580
it didn't seem like it was coming out of his mouth.
It was like,

1648
01:45:28.581 --> 01:45:32.150
seemed like it was like he's playing a tape or something.
It's just crazy.

1649
01:45:32.151 --> 01:45:35.450
He had the all the mannerisms down just like that.
And that was the way to do it.

1650
01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:40.160
My sister and I,
we went together.
I was doing shows actually in part of the trip,

1651
01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:44.810
but they,
uh,
we went,
we every where we ate was so bad.
We got the wrong,

1652
01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:46.310
we didn't know we even know what to order.

1653
01:45:46.311 --> 01:45:50.270
We just pointed at stuff and just said something at the menu and got just like

1654
01:45:50.271 --> 01:45:54.290
an ear soup or something like that.
Like a soup just with ears,
Moose,
Moose suit.

1655
01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:58.520
It was moose here soup.
And I just want to come down for Chinese Moose to plater.

1656
01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:02.300
Yeah.
And um,
but then when we went to this restaurant with this guy,

1657
01:46:02.810 --> 01:46:06.170
it was the best Chinese meal I've ever had.
He knew how to do it,
but,
um,

1658
01:46:06.260 --> 01:46:11.010
I had this idea for a,
um,
I dunno,
a series or something,
um,

1659
01:46:11.140 --> 01:46:12.800
about a guy who's,

1660
01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:16.250
he's white and he's as a baby,

1661
01:46:16.251 --> 01:46:21.251
he's adopted by Chinese people and they bring them to China and they raised them

1662
01:46:22.061 --> 01:46:25.370
in China fully.
And so he doesn't even speak.

1663
01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:29.060
He speaks really poor English and he speaks fluent Chinese,

1664
01:46:29.061 --> 01:46:31.250
but he's white and he has an accent and stuff.

1665
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:35.270
And then he goes back to the United States to kind of find his routes and stuff.

1666
01:46:35.630 --> 01:46:39.590
And um,
but he has this Chinese accent and everyone thinks that he's making,

1667
01:46:39.591 --> 01:46:41.840
he's uh,
yeah,
he's making fun of Chinese people or something,

1668
01:46:41.841 --> 01:46:43.430
but that's actually how he taught.
Sure.
Now,

1669
01:46:43.540 --> 01:46:46.550
<v 5>oh,
have you ever heard of foreign accent syndrome?
No.</v>

1670
01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:50.250
Where people wake up one day and they just have like a crazy

1671
01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:51.083
<v 12>training.
Exactly.</v>

1672
01:46:51.100 --> 01:46:53.360
<v 20>Like a,
have a knot.
I surely heard the,</v>

1673
01:46:53.361 --> 01:46:57.730
my voice in the conversation nearly for Ya know that ladies

1674
01:46:57.810 --> 01:47:01.310
<v 12>white,
she's English.
Wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.
She just wakes up and has an attic.</v>

1675
01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:06.200
<v 4>Well,
they usually,
it's prompted by some type of head trauma.
Yeah.
Okay.</v>

1676
01:47:06.230 --> 01:47:09.860
So these,
uh,
people have,
have some type of accident,

1677
01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:13.000
something that affects the brain usually that,
um,

1678
01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:17.600
then gives them a foreign accent but not,
you know,
your language abilities.

1679
01:47:17.850 --> 01:47:20.900
Like you,
you're,
you're speaking your native language but with a foreign accent.

1680
01:47:20.901 --> 01:47:21.040
Yeah.

1681
01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:23.440
<v 12>But wait,
wait,
but is it like she,</v>

1682
01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:29.640
she's adopting something or like she'd adopting the Anat in voluntarily adopting

1683
01:47:31.181 --> 01:47:34.840
a Chinese accent or something.
She,
yeah.
Or is it that it just,

1684
01:47:34.870 --> 01:47:37.440
she sounded kind of weird that it sounds like a Chinese Zach?

1685
01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:41.330
<v 4>Well,
that's an interesting question,
but they have,
I mean there's,</v>

1686
01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:44.900
there's a number of cases that have it throughout the world in the,

1687
01:47:44.901 --> 01:47:48.710
in those stuff that we've looked up where there,

1688
01:47:48.711 --> 01:47:51.770
there's just not enough information to know exactly what's going on.

1689
01:47:52.010 --> 01:47:54.260
Like they know there's,
there's been one where they were like,
oh,

1690
01:47:54.261 --> 01:47:57.470
this lady's just fucking with people.
Like it was a hoax.

1691
01:47:57.860 --> 01:48:01.710
But there's ladies like this lady has,
you know,

1692
01:48:02.420 --> 01:48:06.680
she's been doing it for like at this point,
like five,
six years.
And it was,

1693
01:48:06.830 --> 01:48:10.220
she hasn't key play it again.
Yeah.
And her grammars and correct.

1694
01:48:10.370 --> 01:48:11.930
<v 20>Which is interesting.
I have a knot.</v>

1695
01:48:12.010 --> 01:48:16.930
I challis hide the my voice in the conversation for nearly four year now.

1696
01:48:17.410 --> 01:48:19.480
<v 12>That's interesting cause I was thinking,</v>

1697
01:48:19.510 --> 01:48:23.710
I was wondering if it was just that the head trauma or whatever it was affected

1698
01:48:23.711 --> 01:48:28.711
her speech and it happens to sound like a foreigner or if it's like some kind of

1699
01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:34.560
weird thing where the brain is taking from an accident that she's heard doing

1700
01:48:34.830 --> 01:48:39.770
that.
I mean it sounds distinctly like an Asian.
Yeah,

1701
01:48:39.910 --> 01:48:43.780
it does.
Yeah.
Accent.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
This actually,
but then again,
you know,

1702
01:48:43.781 --> 01:48:47.830
sometimes people want their desk when they're death.
Yeah.
They sound French.

1703
01:48:47.860 --> 01:48:49.960
Kind of.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?

1704
01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:52.480
How do blind people wipe?
Have you ever thought about

1705
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:57.300
like do you,
how do you think a blind person,
no,

1706
01:48:57.330 --> 01:48:59.980
I mean it's time to stop all of that that we had.

1707
01:49:00.010 --> 01:49:04.060
We had a very deep conversation last time I was here,

1708
01:49:04.090 --> 01:49:05.710
not at this specific location,

1709
01:49:05.711 --> 01:49:10.510
but on this show about wiping techniques and stuff.
And you know,
for me,
right,

1710
01:49:10.570 --> 01:49:14.780
you showed,
I think I used to have a joke about that.
I don't just wipe until you,

1711
01:49:14.781 --> 01:49:16.930
you can't see that the poo on the tissue,

1712
01:49:16.931 --> 01:49:21.080
but I wipe until you can't smell the anything on the tissue interest.

1713
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:24.400
It's like not even,
cause sometimes you can't see it,

1714
01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:28.810
but you might be able to smell something that you always know your paper.
Well,

1715
01:49:28.811 --> 01:49:31.180
I don't really do such a thing as much anymore,

1716
01:49:31.181 --> 01:49:35.890
but if I can as much meaning to I did it.
I used this,
definitely smell the paper.

1717
01:49:35.891 --> 01:49:39.130
I wouldn't get that close though,
but I would,
if I could smell it from here,

1718
01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:42.820
know then that would be,
but I don't actually come to think of it.

1719
01:49:42.821 --> 01:49:45.250
I probably don't smell the tissue really anymore.

1720
01:49:45.251 --> 01:49:46.590
But I did used to do that though.

1721
01:49:46.930 --> 01:49:49.870
Have you ever taken a messy brown and then like,

1722
01:49:49.871 --> 01:49:53.510
you know when you keep wiping and wiping and wiping and then the rest,
right?

1723
01:49:54.330 --> 01:49:55.750
Yes.
Infinite life.

1724
01:49:56.590 --> 01:50:00.970
Now have you ever gone to shower to get rid of the infinite pill?

1725
01:50:01.810 --> 01:50:06.130
No.
I just,
I kinda just keep going.
Even though it takes a really long time.

1726
01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:10.340
I keep going until it's finally ends.
Even though that sometimes,
well,

1727
01:50:10.430 --> 01:50:13.060
you know why that's because blood is starting to mix in with it because you've

1728
01:50:13.061 --> 01:50:14.770
wiped so much that it started to bleed.

1729
01:50:15.110 --> 01:50:18.890
And so I feel like we talked about this last time I,
yeah,

1730
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:22.660
you keep wiping.
It's going to eventually you start,

1731
01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:27.070
it starts showing up because of the blood and I don't know why.

1732
01:50:30.020 --> 01:50:30.853
Cause you already know.

1733
01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:41.640
<v 4>Those are all the categories represented in that one clip we'd like to track.</v>

1734
01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:46.320
That was good.
But yeah.
How,
how do blind people finish though?

1735
01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:48.500
They said that they're,
the,

1736
01:50:48.510 --> 01:50:53.460
the email that we got was that when like you already know about when one of your

1737
01:50:53.461 --> 01:50:57.660
senses goes,
others heightens that,
that they pick up that your,

1738
01:50:57.661 --> 01:51:02.661
your sense of touch is so heightened at that point that what you feel also

1739
01:51:02.941 --> 01:51:04.800
dictates,
yeah,
no,

1740
01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:10.430
there's no resistance and that means that it's a smooth,
clean lie.

1741
01:51:11.090 --> 01:51:15.500
<v 12>I don't,
I,
you know what,
it really makes me start to think that maybe,</v>

1742
01:51:16.610 --> 01:51:19.010
well I don't want to say anything,
but I don't know.

1743
01:51:19.011 --> 01:51:22.010
It makes me start to not trust blind people.

1744
01:51:22.220 --> 01:51:25.610
<v 4>Hypocrite.
Because Christina as much,
here we go.
I got an email.</v>

1745
01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:30.020
I had been listening to old episodes and something from episode three 70 stood

1746
01:51:30.021 --> 01:51:31.820
out to personality champ.

1747
01:51:31.821 --> 01:51:35.660
Tom was playing a song that had Christina talking about being down to prove

1748
01:51:35.661 --> 01:51:37.970
she's the water champ.
Yet in recent weeks,

1749
01:51:38.050 --> 01:51:41.270
she declined to approve it as if it was beneath her.
This true,

1750
01:51:41.300 --> 01:51:45.350
this proves to me not only was Tom a true champion as he's willing to defend his

1751
01:51:45.351 --> 01:51:49.100
title like a professional,
but Christina is a choppy,

1752
01:51:49.101 --> 01:51:53.990
changey hypocrite and capable of being champion at anything.
Actually,

1753
01:51:53.991 --> 01:51:57.140
I take that back that she is clearly the hypocrite.
Champ.

1754
01:51:57.740 --> 01:52:01.790
I'm reigns as the water posture and personality champ.
Meanwhile,

1755
01:52:01.791 --> 01:52:06.791
Christina is simply a second grade moose soup eating liar from Troy in New

1756
01:52:07.310 --> 01:52:11.560
Zealand.
Why does choppy Chang mean anyway?
How racist is that?
I don't know.

1757
01:52:11.630 --> 01:52:13.340
I don't let the records show Yana

1758
01:52:14.510 --> 01:52:18.110
<v 12>currently drinking glass of water.
Tom,
where's your water in this episode?</v>

1759
01:52:18.650 --> 01:52:23.330
It's not because you're drinking soda via with fake sugar in it.

1760
01:52:23.690 --> 01:52:26.990
As we had the water expert in here and he couldn't even drink that,

1761
01:52:26.991 --> 01:52:31.700
he spit it out.
Oh,
the wood.
The guy who was the race start,

1762
01:52:31.701 --> 01:52:35.720
ray and stark bar.
There was a guy at the,
uh,
I don't know,

1763
01:52:35.721 --> 01:52:40.370
I was like ray and stark bars.
Is that like the Los Angeles County Museum of Art?

1764
01:52:40.610 --> 01:52:42.020
There's a restaurant there.
Mark,

1765
01:52:42.050 --> 01:52:45.020
I think his name is Martin [inaudible] work anymore and maybe it was working.

1766
01:52:45.170 --> 01:52:50.150
He's a water Somalia Patina.
Oh yeah.
I kind of,
I kind of,

1767
01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:54.130
I talked to him myself.
You talked about,
uh,
did you,

1768
01:52:54.140 --> 01:52:55.820
do you bring in the different waters and you to try there?

1769
01:52:55.830 --> 01:52:59.000
We've tried like six or from water.
Some of you I tried,

1770
01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:02.030
I tried three when I was with him as fascinating guy.
Yeah.

1771
01:53:02.031 --> 01:53:04.480
It's really interesting.
Yeah.
He just goes to different needs.
Something,

1772
01:53:04.630 --> 01:53:08.600
excuse me again,
just goes to different cities and he,
um,
wait,
should we break,

1773
01:53:08.601 --> 01:53:11.080
write down?
No,
no,
no.
Um,
uh,
he,

1774
01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:14.570
we'd go to different cities and he always like tries to tap just to see what it

1775
01:53:14.571 --> 01:53:17.220
tastes like.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
We learned so much.

1776
01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:20.870
That episode you tried that really heavy on the mineral wine was like kind of

1777
01:53:20.871 --> 01:53:25.550
salty,
kind of.
Yeah.
Did he give you that whitewash?
That one.

1778
01:53:25.551 --> 01:53:28.730
That was like a Whitewater,
oh,
it's a full thing.
It was a full thing.

1779
01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:32.240
Everything cool guys pricing.
Oh,
okay.
Okay.
By the way,
I don't want to,

1780
01:53:32.241 --> 01:53:37.241
I hope that I don't want any blind listeners to be offended about what I was

1781
01:53:37.371 --> 01:53:39.160
saying.
I was just thinking you,

1782
01:53:39.230 --> 01:53:43.940
you bring up an interesting point about that and uh,
I'm sure there's a way,

1783
01:53:44.090 --> 01:53:48.530
and I'm sure they'd probably just use a lot of water and kind of just hope for

1784
01:53:48.531 --> 01:53:50.670
the best kind of yeah.
If you know what I mean or whatever.
Well,

1785
01:53:50.810 --> 01:53:53.510
because then the infinite wipes,
I mean you walk around with leaky,

1786
01:53:53.511 --> 01:53:54.650
but all day long,

1787
01:53:54.890 --> 01:53:59.390
so you just wiping your butt all day when you have an infinite loop.

1788
01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:05.060
<v 4>Got a pool.
Um,
tell me the name again of the special appealing to the mainstream.</v>

1789
01:54:05.310 --> 01:54:05.990
The mainstream.
He's,

1790
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:09.280
here's a cut from appealing to mainstream Brenton white box CSOS special.

1791
01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:15.410
<v 18>Oh,
I,
because y'all allowed it baby to wake me up that damn door.</v>

1792
01:54:16.490 --> 01:54:19.010
Okay.

1793
01:54:23.660 --> 01:54:25.020
I don't have to watch no lane.

1794
01:54:27.310 --> 01:54:30.240
<v 4>So she actually,
she's making a great point.
Hmm.</v>

1795
01:54:30.580 --> 01:54:35.580
She was woken up by somebody who's letting their kid play video at volume with

1796
01:54:36.551 --> 01:54:37.650
no headphones negative,

1797
01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:40.740
which is one of my personally I think that's a incredibly rude yeah.

1798
01:54:40.810 --> 01:54:42.940
And forget about,
she is saying like,

1799
01:54:43.070 --> 01:54:48.070
I'm not getting to sleep because you're letting your kid go and fucking play

1800
01:54:48.461 --> 01:54:51.780
shit.
Um,
but no,
I agree.

1801
01:54:51.870 --> 01:54:56.820
<v 18>I totally agree.
Yeah.
Well y'all got this fall.
Nice.</v>

1802
01:54:56.821 --> 01:55:00.690
China woke me up with the Scooby Doo.
See it?
Yeah.

1803
01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:05.520
<v 12>I guess my,
I guess my approach would have been a little different though,</v>

1804
01:55:05.521 --> 01:55:10.350
you know?
Oh well I probably would have just said,
um,
excuse me,
can you turn,

1805
01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:15.680
can you not have the volume on on this because he's seen you please cause not

1806
01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:20.730
have my mind.
Cause then I like,
yeah,
the flight attendants eventually get yeah.

1807
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:29.420
<v 18>This fucking baby.
A black day.
Yeah.</v>

1808
01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:30.773
That would have

1809
01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:36.320
cut the damn noise because you can get an antibody us and getting cooked.

1810
01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:41.460
<v 12>He's saying cause too.
Yeah.
He said,
she said anybody can get,</v>

1811
01:55:41.660 --> 01:55:43.410
was this like a family reunion on the plane?

1812
01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:47.200
<v 18>Sparkling and then</v>

1813
01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:54.330
letting the baby wake up.
Everybody would just go,
the dude's shit.

1814
01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:56.130
I don't give a fuck.

1815
01:55:56.770 --> 01:55:58.750
<v 5>She's right.
That is disrespectful as hell.</v>

1816
01:55:59.020 --> 01:56:00.790
One time Tom and I were at a really fancy,

1817
01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:03.400
we were really fancy restaurant for dinner.
Yeah.
And if you remember,

1818
01:56:03.401 --> 01:56:06.520
and there was a family and the baby had the IPAD,
which is fine,

1819
01:56:06.730 --> 01:56:11.500
but it was full volume.
Just boop,
boop.
All adults.
Why is it baby up?

1820
01:56:11.530 --> 01:56:13.990
It's late anyways.
The baby should be in bed.
Yeah,

1821
01:56:14.230 --> 01:56:19.060
and playing stupid fucking IPAD.
That's so obvious.
People,
not that it's wrong.

1822
01:56:19.090 --> 01:56:20.980
Give your baby and iPad.
I don't care about that.

1823
01:56:20.981 --> 01:56:24.150
But then give the kid I what does everyone have to hear the earphones?

1824
01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:25.120
What an earbud sorry.

1825
01:56:25.180 --> 01:56:28.360
<v 4>I would just say this is what I would do.
I would say,
like I said,
you know,</v>

1826
01:56:28.370 --> 01:56:31.810
would say,
can you turn it down?
Can you turn off the volume please?
Yeah.

1827
01:56:32.110 --> 01:56:35.080
And then if they didn't do it,
then I would call it flight attendant and say,

1828
01:56:35.081 --> 01:56:36.940
yeah,
she's right.
She's not turning it off.

1829
01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:42.610
<v 18>Follow the rules.
His baby won't be on Google.
We do see it</v>

1830
01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:48.780
that day.
The,
hey,
the baby had to go through down,

1831
01:56:48.781 --> 01:56:53.090
let me tell you what the baby had to go prove it out with wellcare batty Odo

1832
01:56:53.091 --> 01:56:53.970
meal.
But this tool,

1833
01:56:54.060 --> 01:56:57.480
oh the computer now walking through here and I went out on what region is in.

1834
01:56:57.950 --> 01:57:02.490

I'm sorry,
my bad baby seen him with the little computer

1835
01:57:04.490 --> 01:57:05.323
<v 4>computer.</v>

1836
01:57:08.030 --> 01:57:13.030
I like that the ladies like I'm like she's so first of all she's such in Zombie

1837
01:57:13.191 --> 01:57:16.820
land.
Who knows that this is the third leg of her trip.

1838
01:57:16.821 --> 01:57:20.810
But like ignores all noise anyways is I didn't hear,
did you hear it?

1839
01:57:20.811 --> 01:57:23.300
She's like yeah.
Anything.
Yeah.

1840
01:57:23.550 --> 01:57:25.470
<v 18>Yeah.
Body of woke me up with this tool.</v>

1841
01:57:25.471 --> 01:57:28.860
We do shit now walking through shit out on here.
That's south.

1842
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:31.080
Did not hear that.
I'm sorry.

1843
01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:36.240
<v 5>Ah,

She's right.</v>

1844
01:57:36.270 --> 01:57:40.380
She did hear that Shit.
You heard that cause yeah cause cause you,
she heard that.

1845
01:57:40.660 --> 01:57:41.493
She heard that.

1846
01:57:43.230 --> 01:57:47.010
<v 18>I don't know what to tell you where I need to know.
It's no,
it's no,</v>

1847
01:57:47.011 --> 01:57:51.340
it's no worries.
Sorry that lag out.
I gotta be sorry.

1848
01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:55.610
He's parents depending on his fault.
I'm just jelly.
You know,

1849
01:57:55.860 --> 01:58:00.450
this shit was wrong.
It was the parents fault.

1850
01:58:00.510 --> 01:58:01.030
Okay.

1851
01:58:01.030 --> 01:58:04.720
<v 4>Is kind of calming down though.
She actually lives,
she's because she,</v>

1852
01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:09.110
she's actually,
it's,
it's getting less emotional and more logical.
Yeah.

1853
01:58:09.190 --> 01:58:11.280
And cause she wrapped it on emotion.
Yeah.

1854
01:58:11.350 --> 01:58:14.980
Then it switched over to logic and her logic is correct here.
Logic is correct.

1855
01:58:14.981 --> 01:58:17.580
She calmed down and he's still making the,
she knows she's right.

1856
01:58:17.690 --> 01:58:19.810
<v 5>Yeah.
Cause cause cause yeah,</v>

1857
01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:23.360
everybody can get it.

1858
01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:30.140
<v 4>Would you rather be on the receiving end of her lecturing you like that or be</v>

1859
01:58:31.411 --> 01:58:35.590
retarded?
Oh,
um,

1860
01:58:36.370 --> 01:58:40.940
sure.
Think.
Do you think you'd know you're retarded?
Right,
right,
right.

1861
01:58:42.370 --> 01:58:46.660
<v 12>I guess I'd rather be on the receiving end because I think I'd actually enjoy it</v>

1862
01:58:46.661 --> 01:58:50.800
actually to some degree getting yelled at being called because,

1863
01:58:50.801 --> 01:58:54.670
and you'd have a new five minutes for sure that,
that'll be my new special.

1864
01:58:56.050 --> 01:58:57.440
What would it be called?
Appealing.

1865
01:58:57.670 --> 01:59:01.720
Appealing to the south because the south coast,
every link to the,

1866
01:59:01.810 --> 01:59:03.160
because everyone can get it.

1867
01:59:03.490 --> 01:59:05.830
That would be the name of the special cause that's what she said.

1868
01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:08.220
Everyone can get it.
Well she does.
Oh yeah.

1869
01:59:08.680 --> 01:59:11.150
It kind of like it falls in line with appealing to the mainstream.

1870
01:59:11.151 --> 01:59:14.140
I mean everyone can get it.
Everyone.
Everyone yet it cuts because,
yeah.

1871
01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:19.250
Well what about,
what if it was just called because
um,

1872
01:59:20.250 --> 01:59:25.250
the rather be retarded or when you do your act it's like the hackiest who's like

1873
01:59:28.751 --> 01:59:33.640
dead that we can make fun of.
Um,
it's all like in 1950 was alive.

1874
01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:36.640
Do you guys ever talk crap about comedians?
Pretty much.

1875
01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:40.090
It's like the worst act ever.
It's basically everything that you hate,

1876
01:59:40.300 --> 01:59:43.900
but you have to do the act.
You have to think.
Trying to think of like a hack,

1877
01:59:43.930 --> 01:59:47.870
like someone who's dead,
who's hacked,
like you've got like prior Carlin,

1878
01:59:50.540 --> 01:59:55.540
but it's just a cheesy puppets explosions.

1879
01:59:56.381 --> 02:00:01.210
It's magic.
That all sounds good to me.
That is not puppets.

1880
02:00:01.900 --> 02:00:04.300
Puppets.
I'm sure if puppets,
I don't do puppets,

1881
02:00:04.301 --> 02:00:08.200
but I mean if I could do puppets and they were cool,
I would do,
yeah.

1882
02:00:08.220 --> 02:00:09.830
Cool locations,
I would do that.

1883
02:00:10.650 --> 02:00:13.440
Would you rather I do explosions.

1884
02:00:13.450 --> 02:00:17.620
There are explosions in my special actually appealing to the mainstream.

1885
02:00:17.621 --> 02:00:19.720
There is definitely an explosion explosion,
so

1886
02:00:22.060 --> 02:00:22.900
it's good though.

1887
02:00:24.860 --> 02:00:29.800
He retarded or have a hacky Yak or do the worst possible,
like whatever you hate,

1888
02:00:29.801 --> 02:00:34.120
whoever you hate in comedy.
Well I'd probably do that.
Right.

1889
02:00:34.150 --> 02:00:36.430
Versus being retired.
I wouldn't,
would I?
Well hold on.

1890
02:00:36.431 --> 02:00:40.370
I mean I guess the question is,
is what I realized it was bad,
but yes,

1891
02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:42.970
you actively have to do it.

1892
02:00:42.971 --> 02:00:47.890
Like I'm me and I have to do this act and you know it goes in here already are

1893
02:00:47.891 --> 02:00:50.500
retarded by the way.
You're fucking breaking this down.

1894
02:00:53.020 --> 02:00:56.560
It goes against kind of hard or sensibilities and you're going up every night

1895
02:00:56.561 --> 02:00:57.670
and you're doing these shit cans.

1896
02:00:57.671 --> 02:01:00.760
Definitely hard to do the act and you can't do anything that you believe is

1897
02:01:00.761 --> 02:01:04.270
funny.
You have to do like this act is what I'm saying and I don't realize I'm

1898
02:01:04.271 --> 02:01:07.960
retarded.
Retarded.
That's the biggest question that we have on the show.

1899
02:01:07.961 --> 02:01:10.840
Is that do retarded people know they're retarded?
No,

1900
02:01:10.841 --> 02:01:13.960
I think about that too sometimes.
Well,
my brother had this thought,

1901
02:01:13.990 --> 02:01:17.050
this idea that of he had this idea of like a,

1902
02:01:17.051 --> 02:01:21.730
maybe a movie even about a retarded person who knew they were retarded and you

1903
02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:24.550
know,
just didn't,
didn't like it.
You know,
they wish they were smarter,

1904
02:01:24.970 --> 02:01:26.460
they wish they weren't retarded and they,

1905
02:01:26.890 --> 02:01:29.860
and that that was like a thing they had to come to terms with.
You know,

1906
02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:36.410
he had this image of a guy just looking up at the sky going,
why,
you know,

1907
02:01:36.430 --> 02:01:40.010
he was retarded and stuff.
Or was it a comedy or was it more like a drama?

1908
02:01:40.011 --> 02:01:41.330
Like a drama,
you know,

1909
02:01:41.331 --> 02:01:46.331
serious like a serious movie about someone who is mentally challenging and is

1910
02:01:46.761 --> 02:01:49.040
aware of it though.
Oh that's right.
Okay.
So let's say,

1911
02:01:49.041 --> 02:01:53.120
and in your world you were aware of it.
Yeah,
that's hard.

1912
02:01:53.930 --> 02:01:57.770
It's hard.
All your creativity is stifled basically.

1913
02:01:57.771 --> 02:01:59.990
Cause you have to do an act that you don't believe.
Let me ask you this,

1914
02:01:59.991 --> 02:02:04.910
do I make money as this hacky comedian?
Yes.
I probably would do this well,

1915
02:02:05.450 --> 02:02:07.820
so I can't answer this.
I would say this,

1916
02:02:07.821 --> 02:02:12.821
I'd probably pick the hacky thing because at least I can provide a life for my

1917
02:02:13.161 --> 02:02:17.090
family or my kids or something,
you know?
But you can be the retarded comic.

1918
02:02:17.410 --> 02:02:20.170
That's thing doing his own thing,
doing what he wants to be.

1919
02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:22.880
He can be a retarded artist artist.

1920
02:02:26.090 --> 02:02:29.600
You can be uh,
you know,
at least have integrity.

1921
02:02:31.250 --> 02:02:33.960
You can be retired and have integrity or be a hack and

1922
02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:40.670
so you can actually provide for your family too is retarded.
But I guess I've,

1923
02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:45.860
I guess I value connecting to people on a non retarded level,

1924
02:02:45.890 --> 02:02:46.723
you know what I mean?

1925
02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:50.360
And I don't mean that in any kind of offensive way or anything,
but just,

1926
02:02:50.420 --> 02:02:55.220
you know,
like being able to connect to people in an sort of intellectual way.

1927
02:02:56.910 --> 02:03:01.010
I value that.
I guess I value that,
but it'd be very alone.
Okay.

1928
02:03:01.050 --> 02:03:05.360
What about you guys?
What do you do?
Being a hack or being retarded or,

1929
02:03:05.361 --> 02:03:08.300
and also back to,
but I have a son,
I have a son,

1930
02:03:08.301 --> 02:03:10.970
so I couldn't take care of my son if I were retarded.

1931
02:03:10.971 --> 02:03:13.550
So I'd have to always choose the other thing.
Yeah.

1932
02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:17.680
I guess I don't want to have someone take care of me.
Then again,

1933
02:03:17.690 --> 02:03:21.530
actually getting taken care of could be fun.
It was like,
oh,

1934
02:03:21.531 --> 02:03:22.610
I want to be retired at hands down.

1935
02:03:22.670 --> 02:03:27.670
It would be so liberating if no responsibility family and it's different.

1936
02:03:28.611 --> 02:03:31.640
Different.
Well,
if I wasn't,
I guess if I was retarded,

1937
02:03:31.641 --> 02:03:36.500
I wouldn't care about having a family maybe as much or you do care.

1938
02:03:36.501 --> 02:03:39.680
I am aware of it.
Right.
I'm aware of being retarded.
Right.
It's hard.

1939
02:03:39.710 --> 02:03:43.910
It's really hard.
Just so much more than I wanted.
I did this question,

1940
02:03:45.410 --> 02:03:48.360
uh,
what was the other question was where the w would you rather,

1941
02:03:48.890 --> 02:03:51.500
I don't remember.
Something about poo or something.

1942
02:03:53.830 --> 02:03:57.990
I'd go retarded.
So he,
does he go retarded?

1943
02:03:58.020 --> 02:04:03.020
He's retarded over eating Chinese or Asian really would rather be retarded than

1944
02:04:03.891 --> 02:04:08.630
eat Asian food.
Gosh,
really?
Yeah.

1945
02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:13.720
I know that your dad wipes from back to front.
Does he was down.

1946
02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:16.560
He wipes down.
That's right.
That's right.
I remember that from last time.

1947
02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:21.620
That's good,
man.
Yeah.
Has Your Dad ever been on the show live?

1948
02:04:22.130 --> 02:04:26.690
No.
He's called in a bunch.
Your Dad's in Florida,
right?

1949
02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:29.780
Yeah,
it's called a bunch of times.
We've called him.

1950
02:04:30.140 --> 02:04:32.500
He sat here and did an interview.
Well,
you know,

1951
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:35.750
I've talked to them and recorded it and then play the audio later.

1952
02:04:36.230 --> 02:04:41.060
That's the extent of it.
Um,
you,
what about you?
You retarded?

1953
02:04:41.410 --> 02:04:44.930
I am.
I would go retired.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Both the Oh yeah,
no,
you can,

1954
02:04:45.310 --> 02:04:48.000
I want to take care of her.
Can't be retarded.

1955
02:04:48.540 --> 02:04:51.040
What does he could though if I could,
I,

1956
02:04:51.260 --> 02:04:56.040
I my my mental capacity is all I have.
Well wait,
what if you're,
what if,
yeah.

1957
02:04:56.610 --> 02:04:59.700
What if your son was retarded to therefore as a retired person who could take

1958
02:04:59.701 --> 02:05:03.930
care of them?
That's interesting.
But I don't know.
I don't think you could.

1959
02:05:03.931 --> 02:05:07.830
Honestly,
I know I can't be retarded caregiver as the crop Tory Center,

1960
02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:11.700
the badger shown above and red is concerned with hearing,
oh,

1961
02:05:11.701 --> 02:05:14.970
we're having too much fun shown here on the outer surface of the brain.

1962
02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:16.350
Whenever we get too excited,

1963
02:05:16.351 --> 02:05:19.710
lies within the temporal lobe is found within the brain.

1964
02:05:19.930 --> 02:05:23.370
The cerebral cortex on both sides of the kind.
Kinda interesting.
Yeah.

1965
02:05:23.371 --> 02:05:27.120
This one's the hosting Cory pathways begin in the nerve fibers of the Oregon of

1966
02:05:27.121 --> 02:05:31.320
core team in the inner ear.
Now it's still,
see how it changed,

1967
02:05:31.770 --> 02:05:35.430
right?
It's like cleanses the palate.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're like,
oh,
okay.

1968
02:05:35.431 --> 02:05:39.910
I can make a boring sorbet.
Yeah.
That's Kinda cool actually.
Yeah.
Born.

1969
02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:45.060
That's what we do.
There's a,
a big words,
Christina remix here.

1970
02:05:45.780 --> 02:05:50.600
Do you want,
I don't want to hear it.
No,
it's a big world.
It's a what?

1971
02:05:53.940 --> 02:05:58.440
Yeah.
I want to know Brandon,
do you,
uh,
do you want me to skip it?
Well,

1972
02:05:58.441 --> 02:06:02.260
you've teased it to the audience.
Now we have to play me.
It's in my,

1973
02:06:02.450 --> 02:06:05.030
I thought you saw it.
I mean,
it's in solid.
Wait,
what?

1974
02:06:05.090 --> 02:06:08.720
I'm just doing the email solid.
There's people that go,
I thought I saw it.
Saw it.

1975
02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:12.930
You saw it that people make songs from the show a lot.
Oh yes.

1976
02:06:13.860 --> 02:06:17.210
I'm not going to say the n word anymore because I don't want the songs to come

1977
02:06:17.220 --> 02:06:21.420
on.
Oh,
you said that.
Wait,

1978
02:06:21.421 --> 02:06:23.820
were you saying the n word a lot or something?
No,
I give it to you.

1979

<v 1>Hey,

It's a damn

1981
02:06:35.240 --> 02:06:39.320

Yeah,

1987
02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:04.390
<v 12>And then obviously returning to people.
Yes.
They can be racist.</v>

<v 12>There you go.
Thanks.
I was reading an email from us and Dan made that.
Thank you.</v>

1990
02:07:14.250 --> 02:07:18.110
[inaudible] cool.
And in the email it said the n word and so yeah,

1991
02:07:18.111 --> 02:07:19.880
that's whenever I say the n word on the show,

1992
02:07:19.881 --> 02:07:24.050
it gets remixed and she was reading something that said it and then I don't just

1993
02:07:24.051 --> 02:07:27.240
say it.
Oh yeah,
no,
there's a context for it.
I don't,
I don't know.

1994
02:07:27.320 --> 02:07:31.960
I approve [inaudible] you made 800 party line.
Jesus.
Yeah,
no,

1995
02:07:31.970 --> 02:07:36.930
there's a context for any,
I mean there's a safe context.
Anything.
That's why,

1996
02:07:36.940 --> 02:07:38.050
I mean there's always like,

1997
02:07:38.051 --> 02:07:41.980
people sometimes say that you can't say certain things or certain things are

1998
02:07:41.981 --> 02:07:44.630
completely off limits,
but that there's,

1999
02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:49.120
there's always some kind of exception exception or some sort of context where

2000
02:07:49.150 --> 02:07:52.830
you can,
you can say anything Nice,
you know?
Yeah.
Um,

2001
02:07:53.340 --> 02:07:55.690
especially if you're quoting something or reading something.
Sorry.
Yeah,

2002
02:07:55.691 --> 02:07:56.420
of course.

2003
02:07:56.420 --> 02:07:59.780
<v 7>What else do you got there,
Tommy?
Um,
I got,
uh,
well I have a,</v>

2004
02:07:59.930 --> 02:08:04.040
another song that we'll,
we'll we'll close with a,
okay.

2005
02:08:04.130 --> 02:08:08.350
We did the uh,
oh,
there's a sperm extractor machine that's new.

2006
02:08:08.750 --> 02:08:09.980
I don't know.
Brent will use

2007
02:08:11.890 --> 02:08:16.890
<v 12>this unusual machine aims to take the embarrassment out of sperm donation called</v>

2008
02:08:16.991 --> 02:08:20.160
the sperm extraction.
It was devised by doing [inaudible] Jang,

2009
02:08:20.670 --> 02:08:23.140
one of China's Django San way medical science.

2010
02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:25.650
I like how you're more embarrassing than just jerking it,

2011
02:08:25.740 --> 02:08:28.440
<v 7>isn't it?
I mean the thing is that it's like,</v>

2012
02:08:28.730 --> 02:08:32.370
it's an ATM basically designed with a hole in it that you just,

2013
02:08:32.371 --> 02:08:33.300
what kind of like we talked,

2014
02:08:33.510 --> 02:08:36.510
we've talked about like if there was like a suck machine and guys would just

2015
02:08:36.511 --> 02:08:40.140
walk up to it.
I've never talked about that with you.
Yeah,
we did.
Nope,

2016
02:08:40.520 --> 02:08:41.353
that's not right.

2017
02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:49.160
We've talked about come gum and having gum sperm and then they also says that

2018
02:08:49.170 --> 02:08:52.050
people,
but then you were like,
oh,
I had this other thing.
Remember you,

2019
02:08:52.051 --> 02:08:54.480
you brought up the pump station.
Okay.

2020
02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:58.200
That's what this is the I you just said I've never thought of that.

2021
02:08:58.201 --> 02:09:01.800
It's not the sucking,
I didn't say there was a Dick Sucking station.
It's a pump,

2022
02:09:01.801 --> 02:09:05.280
that pump station where you could go and get different guys to Jews in your

2023
02:09:05.281 --> 02:09:07.770
mouth.
Okay,
well I'm thinking a little differently.

2024
02:09:08.180 --> 02:09:11.730
I'm thinking like shots of comm guys walk around with poison in them all the

2025
02:09:11.731 --> 02:09:12.530
time.
Right.

2026
02:09:12.530 --> 02:09:15.930
And it'd be great if you're just walking around like full of rage and they're

2027
02:09:15.931 --> 02:09:20.200
like,
dude,
just walk up to that machine and you go,
I mean,
you're right.

2028
02:09:20.220 --> 02:09:24.780
You're done.
You're like,
it's quick.
Yeah.
Uh Huh.
Yeah.
And it services society.

2029
02:09:24.781 --> 02:09:27.240
Yeah,
like it clean.
It's clean,
right?
You're just like,
yeah.

2030
02:09:27.241 --> 02:09:30.120
How does it clean itself?
I don't know how clear.
Here's what else I want to know.

2031
02:09:30.360 --> 02:09:34.740
You know when she know and she keeps sucking and you're like,
Ooh,

2032
02:09:35.010 --> 02:09:38.340
like what if this thing keeps going and you're like,
stop stops.

2033
02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:39.360
Is there a stop button?

2034
02:09:39.361 --> 02:09:42.570
Like is there an emergency stop like on a treadmill where you pull off and

2035
02:09:42.571 --> 02:09:44.970
you're like,
oh shit,
I fell off this thing.
Like how does,

2036
02:09:45.450 --> 02:09:47.460
that's a real issue because he didn't want to keep,

2037
02:09:49.290 --> 02:09:51.570
you can just pull your wiener out.
No,
cause it looks like,

2038
02:09:51.630 --> 02:09:53.470
it looks like it gets pretty tight on you.

2039
02:09:53.690 --> 02:09:57.230
<v 12>Yeah.
She didn't 19 teens.
It is shut down.
Hospitals mostly use.</v>

2040
02:09:57.231 --> 02:10:00.650
It's cool that that guy kind of like is the guy behind it,
you know?
He seems so,

2041
02:10:00.651 --> 02:10:04.960
you know the average.
I know.
Just like Nice Guy and sealed.

2042
02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:10.050
Sealed as to me.
It's political demands.
Excuse,
walk up to that president buttons.

2043
02:10:10.220 --> 02:10:13.460
But she's also using a sperm.
It's supposed to be outside though.
Huh?

2044
02:10:14.090 --> 02:10:16.220
<v 7>Looks like it's just enough.
It looks like it's in,</v>

2045
02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:18.160
it sounds like it's in the hall.

2046
02:10:18.161 --> 02:10:21.160
Like a hallway of a mall or you will put your Dick in this real quick.

2047
02:10:22.060 --> 02:10:23.040
How much do you want one of these

2048
02:10:23.530 --> 02:10:27.320
<v 12>[inaudible] pipe that resembles a vagina?
It's height is adjustable.</v>

2049
02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:31.840
While it's speed for,
since temperature can be very good time.
There you go.
Okay.

2050
02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:34.270
There you go.
Sorry guys.
You're like slow it down.

2051
02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:38.900
How many of these you think this guy's gonna sell commercially?

2052
02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:42.770
That's what sells so well.
I would love to have one of these in the entryway.

2053
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:45.260
I know.
Hi.
Come on in.
Yeah.
How you feeling?

2054
02:10:45.261 --> 02:10:48.860
You won't get your Dick off real quick.
So she and Tom wouldn't,

2055
02:10:48.861 --> 02:10:53.330
you didn't shoot it.
First bullet simulates a female organ.
This is so juvenile,

2056
02:10:53.331 --> 02:10:57.490
but it doesn't part of your brain still.
When you hear Asian languages spoken,

2057
02:10:57.510 --> 02:11:02.400
you're like,
how does that work?
Like he's just like,
he's like,
like,

2058
02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:06.560
it sounds just,
it's different.
It's definitely,
it's definitely different.

2059
02:11:08.190 --> 02:11:12.700
When I hear Asian guy speak in my head,
I still mock it and I go,
ah,
yeah,

2060
02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:18.060
no,
that's going to get remixed mix.
That's a new,
that's a new single.

2061
02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:21.170
You don't do it in your head when you're a kid.

2062
02:11:21.171 --> 02:11:23.050
When you made fun of Asian people,
you know,
because I,

2063
02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:27.110
I think I'm always waiting for like if I hear somebody speaking that usually

2064
02:11:27.111 --> 02:11:30.650
someone's going to translate or something.
So I'm waiting for what,
you know,

2065
02:11:31.330 --> 02:11:34.760
cause I,
I'm all juvenile.
When I heard him talk immediately,
I was mocking it.

2066
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:38.750
I mean,
I don't,
I don't think,
I'm not thinking of mocking noises.
I just,

2067
02:11:38.810 --> 02:11:43.670
I usually just like hearing the noises because it sounds so different.
Sounds,

2068
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:47.090
you know,
really interesting sounds all language has that thing right.

2069
02:11:47.091 --> 02:11:50.510
When you hear like Arabic and the hymen and you're like,

2070
02:11:50.511 --> 02:11:54.000
that's also that guy saying what time is the train?
Get here,
you know?

2071
02:11:54.020 --> 02:11:56.680
And it's all,
but then I'll mark that in my head too.
I'll be on the court.

2072
02:11:57.350 --> 02:11:59.570
<v 4>Yeah.
I actually,
you know,</v>

2073
02:11:59.900 --> 02:12:03.630
I guess mocking is all from perspective,

2074
02:12:03.631 --> 02:12:08.310
but I always kind of fuck with,
uh,
when I hear French,
when I hear some of them,

2075
02:12:08.311 --> 02:12:09.144
like that's,

2076
02:12:10.240 --> 02:12:14.320
<v 12>yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That Shit my head.
Yeah.</v>

2077
02:12:14.790 --> 02:12:19.550
I guess not mocked,
but like,
yeah,
when you kind of created in your head.
Yeah.

2078
02:12:19.551 --> 02:12:24.500
It,
yeah.
It's,
it's interesting.
There's interesting rhythms and tones,

2079
02:12:24.501 --> 02:12:27.590
you know,
to think about or I guess with,

2080
02:12:27.591 --> 02:12:32.060
since I don't speak any mandarin or Cantonese,
I just keep hearing

2081
02:12:32.970 --> 02:12:34.020
<v 4>usually like three difference.</v>

2082
02:12:34.990 --> 02:12:39.250
<v 12>Yeah.
I'm one of them.
Like that's the whole thing.
Yeah.</v>

2083
02:12:42.230 --> 02:12:44.120
No,
I was repeated and you know,

2084
02:12:44.121 --> 02:12:46.990
it's not really what he says cause that's not what he said.

2085
02:12:47.140 --> 02:12:49.190
I don't think exactly making fun of it though.
It's offensive.

2086
02:12:49.191 --> 02:12:52.070
I'm a little offended.
No you're not.
No,
I think it's like,
not really,

2087
02:12:52.071 --> 02:12:56.720
like he's making fun of it.
He's a,
he's like kind of,
you know,
just,
you know,

2088
02:12:56.750 --> 02:13:00.260
try to express the feeling a real thing.

2089
02:13:02.790 --> 02:13:04.060
<v 4>Oh No.</v>

2090
02:13:05.630 --> 02:13:09.710
One time I was showing apartments in Boston after college and I was showing them

2091
02:13:09.711 --> 02:13:14.711
to some Chinese students and like two of them were walking at my pace and then a

2092
02:13:16.251 --> 02:13:19.070
few were further behind.
So when we got to the door,

2093
02:13:19.071 --> 02:13:23.030
we look back and they're like a block behind it.
And so I asked him,
I go,

2094
02:13:23.031 --> 02:13:26.730
how do you say hurry up.
But like aggressively.
And they,

2095
02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:30.060
they gave me just a quick thing to say.
I don't remember what it was,

2096
02:13:30.061 --> 02:13:32.130
but it was like,
sure.
So I turned

2097
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:36.960
<v 12>and I screamed it at the top of my lungs.
And these Chinese if you like,</v>

2098
02:13:37.710 --> 02:13:41.730
and they just ran as fast as they could that it was like learning a little

2099
02:13:41.731 --> 02:13:45.420
expression and other language to say to scream at somebody.
That's a thrill.

2100
02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:50.430
So this Dick Milking machine?
Yeah.
This is just for science.
Is that right?
This,

2101
02:13:50.431 --> 02:13:52.950
is this supposed to be an easier,

2102
02:13:52.980 --> 02:13:56.970
more convenient way to donate.
Donate.
Yeah.

2103
02:13:57.820 --> 02:14:00.680
So sexual intercourse by moving back and forth,

2104
02:14:01.230 --> 02:14:04.350
it's able to buy a huge extent.
Now I want to listen to his voice.

2105
02:14:05.490 --> 02:14:07.800
You could hear him more in,
what was it in this one?

2106
02:14:07.801 --> 02:14:10.700
See The 19 teens at this hospital come on.

2107
02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:17.880
Prove useful for you or logic.
It's funny that it goes in and out like that.

2108
02:14:17.881 --> 02:14:22.530
That just seems so like without a great deal of help because it's like,

2109
02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:24.780
even though it's going in and out like that,
I mean,

2110
02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:27.810
I begin to show a guy putting as well.
I hope so.

2111
02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:29.280
This looks like we're the mouth right now.

2112
02:14:29.330 --> 02:14:32.610
This guy's about to stick his dick in her mouth.
Oh Wow.
I hope he does it.

2113
02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:36.330
At least seeming says it's an efficient way to maximize the amount of weird that

2114
02:14:36.331 --> 02:14:39.570
it goes in and out like that because it almost seems like ineffective in a way.

2115
02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:44.640
Well it just seems like someone should,
it should happen internally kind of.

2116
02:14:44.641 --> 02:14:48.600
You know what I mean?
Exactly.
Exactly.
Yeah.

2117
02:14:48.601 --> 02:14:51.120
You know like cause that seems like someone would just move with it.

2118
02:14:51.121 --> 02:14:51.954
You know what I mean?

2119
02:14:52.350 --> 02:14:55.860
This way definitely this device is far more efficient than masturbation,

2120
02:14:56.340 --> 02:14:59.070
but there are still some,
for instance,

2121
02:14:59.071 --> 02:15:03.780
it can know exactly simulate the temperature and feel of a female organ,
no shit.

2122
02:15:03.790 --> 02:15:08.730
So the device may not fit as well when compared to human beings off the rule.

2123
02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:13.880
It is made out of plastic and metal and also when you know she keeps sucking and

2124
02:15:14.251 --> 02:15:17.520
then you keep shaking,
it can turn that knob that you got to turn that knob down.

2125
02:15:17.550 --> 02:15:22.500
Thanks for coming.
Brand has really nice is annually at $13,000 each.

2126
02:15:22.700 --> 02:15:25.470
Oh there you go.
Been bought by clinics and the USA,
Germany,

2127
02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:28.290
Russia and for any of them sucking machines right there.

2128
02:15:30.230 --> 02:15:34.680
That's I,
he's removing the stigma from sperm donation.
Do you think that's,

2129
02:15:34.740 --> 02:15:38.910
that's what heaven looks like to some people go in a room and there's a bunch of

2130
02:15:38.911 --> 02:15:41.270
them.
Yeah.

2131
02:15:45.690 --> 02:15:49.710
13 grand to get your dick second machine guys.
It's not that bad.
It's not bad.

2132
02:15:49.711 --> 02:15:53.010
The real girl,
the real dolls really are around 10 grand.

2133
02:15:53.900 --> 02:15:58.760
All the high end ones.
Huh?
I from what I've seen on some document or not the,

2134
02:15:58.810 --> 02:16:00.690
the $10 ones from big lots.

2135
02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:07.340
How much are they?
Like 10 grand and they're heavy.
They're really heavy.

2136
02:16:07.341 --> 02:16:10.550
Your Life.
Like you have a bus and one of those I had,
no,

2137
02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:13.480
I've never even seen one.
Really.
I,
I'm,

2138
02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:17.100
I want to see one though in person and I saw a documentary about him.

2139
02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:18.343
I know there's a lot of,

2140
02:16:18.420 --> 02:16:23.420
have you seen videos of people who show they're kind of like do video blogs

2141
02:16:24.211 --> 02:16:29.211
about their life living with real dolls and they treat them very much like real

2142
02:16:29.711 --> 02:16:30.190
people

2143
02:16:30.190 --> 02:16:32.200
<v 13>and they have like relationships with the ice.
You probably saw,</v>

2144
02:16:32.250 --> 02:16:34.870
you probably saw that in the documentary.
There's a lot of that online too,

2145
02:16:34.871 --> 02:16:39.000
just like on Youtube and stuff.
It's really fascinates me a lot actually.

2146
02:16:39.810 --> 02:16:44.410
It's really,
you know,
just that people have these really,

2147
02:16:44.411 --> 02:16:48.700
these like relationships and they,
they really care for these dolls.

2148
02:16:48.820 --> 02:16:51.130
It's all interesting.
And you know what,

2149
02:16:51.131 --> 02:16:55.810
I and I respect it and I approve it cause,
cause I do indeed.
Let's,

2150
02:16:55.811 --> 02:17:00.370

2151
02:17:00.371 --> 02:17:04.330

please check it out.
Yup.
Appealing to the mainstream.

2152
02:17:04.331 --> 02:17:06.450
It's on CSO.
You can watch you.

2153
02:17:06.451 --> 02:17:10.810
So on Amazon prime is an add on service and there's this,

2154
02:17:11.140 --> 02:17:13.960
this is gonna sound like a commercial,
but there's a seven day free trial.

2155
02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:17.610
And even if you don't use the trial,
it's only $4 a month.
But anyway,

2156
02:17:18.010 --> 02:17:22.050

on CSO.
