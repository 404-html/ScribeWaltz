Well,

2
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.383
Christina.

3
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.760
<v 0>I can't get up.
This is why it is.
You think you're a zero</v>

4
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.800
<v 2>murder me in my sleep.
You need to tell your therapist about this.</v>

5
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.220
Reactions are funny in those situations.
Do you have problems?

6
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.230
The problems are paralyzed from the waist down and you're dying of laughter.

7
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.183
That was fun.

8
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.190
<v 0>It's not going to be funny.</v>

9
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.443
<v 3>MMM,</v>

10
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.913
<v 0>I can't get up.</v>

11
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.620
Please bring this up in therapy.
Not Normal.

12
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.850
I can't get up.
Basically

13
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.140
paralyzed from the waist down and you're dying.

14
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.820
<v 2>These are funny in these situations.
This is why it is.</v>

15
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.630
You think you're a serial killer.
You need to tell your therapist about this.

16
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.010
You'd have problems.
It's not supposed to be funny.

17
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.530
Look at the title of the thing.
It's not even funny.

18
00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:33.410
It doesn't say funny anywhere.
I don't know why you're laughing at all.

19
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.840
It's a guy getting run over by a car and you find it a little.
There we go.

20
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.920
<v 0>Well it's,
he goes,</v>

21
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.493
I can't get up.

22
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.200
Please bring this up in therapy.
Not Normal.

23
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.213
I can't get up.

24
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.190
Please bring this up in therapy,
not Mormon.

25
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:18.040
<v 2>Are we</v>

26
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.800
<v 3>done here?
Is this done?
All right.
Excellent.</v>

27
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.480
That was a Dj Lincolnton with a then Lincoln.
Dan with a,

28
00:02:25.481 --> 00:02:29.110

It's good.
It's really funny.

29
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.960
I think it was pretty great.
Thank you Dj Lincoln.

30
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.800
Didn't Lincoln then think and then um,
just say funny.

31
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.120
Look we are,
we're back.
Not that we went anywhere.

32
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.990
That you went to Disney once.
Oh yeah.
I got some stories for you.
Um,

man.
You did?
Yeah.
Not My experience.

35
00:02:54.071 --> 00:02:57.730
I have a joke on my album about how much I hate the whole state of Iowa.
Yeah,

36
00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.690

No,

38
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:06.730
not at the funny bone.

39
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:11.731
I did a tour with the Dub David off and we had to drive through the entire state

40
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.030
because the club loves you.
Yeah.
I loved the funny bone in Desmond's actually.

41
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.440
I think it was that tour I did more than the state.
Yeah.
So sorry.

42
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:24.880
Demoine I took it out on you or Iowa.

Okay.

123
00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.180
<v 3>Ah Man.
You know,
I was thinking,</v>

124
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:41.240
you realize that one of our first really hardcore laughing inappropriate bonding

125
00:09:43.531 --> 00:09:48.531
experiences was a ball kicking video and remember that it was so long ago.

126
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.930
Yeah,
that was funny.
I didn't know I had a love for it until you showed me.

127
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.760
Hey you guys,
you're like,
I want to do this.

128
00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.870
I know you've got so excited about it.
Well,
I feel like I could.
Yeah,

129
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:05.160
I feel like this is the one Shondra of porn that I would really excel kicking

130
00:10:05.161 --> 00:10:05.994
guys in the balls.

131
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.650
It's always amazed me and I think most guys that this is legit a turn on for

132
00:10:10.651 --> 00:10:15.480
some people.
They really,
really,
really want to get kicked in the balls.

133
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:19.350
If you can conceive of it in your mind.
Somebody doing it right now.

134
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:24.810
It exists in the world.
If you can think of it.
That video that we watched,
um,
man,

135
00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:29.160
I wish I could find it.
That was from like Brazil.
No,
uh,
it was Spanish.

136
00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:33.560
I think it was like Argentina or something or Ooh.
Why?
Um,

137
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.500
but they had like,

138
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:39.340
really that girl made that guy believe loving.

139
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.290
That was my fair part.

140
00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:44.160
When she squeezed his balls real hard and the blood was coming out and she goes

141
00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:45.460
Sangria or whatever.

142
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:51.630
And she kept saying like soup for the soup.
Like she wanted him to suffer.
Yes.

143
00:10:51.631 --> 00:10:56.370
Yeah.
I feel like I could really do that for someone else.
Yeah.
Yeah.

144
00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.380
Um,
but only to put that at like,
so the guy that really wants it not,
not well,

145
00:11:01.381 --> 00:11:05.520
yeah.
Someone that these dudes doesn't sign up for this shit,
man.
Yeah.

146
00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:10.650
Really crazy.
I mean,
it's the pain they like.
Yeah.
But you know,

147
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.060
the degradation maybe.

148
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.680
Maybe because there's more to it than just degradation.

149
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:20.490
There's actual pain.
I mean,
that's very painful to get.
Very painful.

150
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.050
There's even a,
by the way,

151
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.800
a lot of people have told me to download caffeine so that this stops going to

152
00:11:25.801 --> 00:11:30.410
sleep.
I got it.
Okay.
Derek,

153
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:35.580
download caffeine.
You idiot.
I got it.
Yeah,
I know.
I'll do it.
My got it.

154
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.860
Got It.
I just got home.
Got It.
Write Right Matt tards.

155
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.140
There's no blue band in the room.
If they're,

156
00:11:43.141 --> 00:11:47.700
if you're wondering why is because our schedule's been so crazy with all the in

157
00:11:47.701 --> 00:11:51.570
and out traveling that uh,
you know,
with coordinating that with a baby,

158
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.010
sometimes we just have to able to run in here when we

159
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.790
<v 6>have some time.
That's what we want.</v>

160
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.650
Our kid is sleeping or it's harder to coordinate right now

161
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.320
anyways.
Can we watch?
I'm dying to see what happens.
Let's see.
There's,

162
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.300
I dunno if this is a I the dissolve it or not.
I think,

163
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.280
I think this one's okay to play du Du,
Du,
Du,
Du.

164
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:13.303
<v 7>Okay.</v>

165
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:31.230
<v 6>You didn't,
who?
I think that is.
I think that's how does my ass hoe smile.</v>

166
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:36.420
I think that's her.
Well,
I think you've got a really good ear.
Wow.

167
00:12:36.421 --> 00:12:40.350
Look at you with the porno actors.
You know exactly who does what,

168
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.890
what a talent you are.
Are you proud of me?
Proud?

169
00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:51.510
What a unique gift you have to play.
A girl said what?

170
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:55.170
But I mean,
that's so proud of you,
sweetie.
I think that's her.

171
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:59.850
I think you're right.
How does my ass hole smell?
Because she's Asian,
right?

172
00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:03.510
Well,
she's,
she looks Asian slash Asian,

173
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:09.120
Asian looks Asian is she has that voice.

174
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:14.040
Had My asshole smell.
Huh?
We got to find that.

175
00:13:14.041 --> 00:13:16.650
Hold on.
We can't move on right now.
My throat hurts and I've,

176
00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:20.640
I've been snoring like a donkey.
God.
Yeah.
Yeah.

177
00:13:20.641 --> 00:13:23.970
I'm real sore today.
Really,
really,

178
00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:26.550
really affecting my instrument,
if you know what I mean.

179
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.460
I know exactly what you mean.
God,
where is that?
How does my ass house smell?

180
00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:37.100
That's pretty good.
Yet
I'm looking at,

181
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:41.670
I just found on accident.
The reason I like jerking off while licking my girl,

182
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.820
look at my boss from my angle while she's licking my balls,

183
00:13:44.821 --> 00:13:46.380
I'm punching her fucking stupid face.

184
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:53.700
Wow.
Wow.
Yeah.
Who she and I might be good at ball kicking together.

185
00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.770
Let's see this amazing

186
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.050
had you say as hell.

187
00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.900
Okay.
All right.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Yeah.
Do the work.

188
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:19.610
No,
she's much more girlish.

189
00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:22.900
That's a MILF.

190
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:30.360
Stick your tongue in my asshole.
That sounds like a 40 plus myself,

191
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.680
like 50 pros

192
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:39.370
<v 8>fucking workload and you know,</v>

193
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:45.890
hey,
you fucking worth it.
Little peak of fucking shit.

194
00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:50.300
<v 6>How does that translate to sexually exciting?
Exciting for some people?</v>

195
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.630
Because to me,
all I hear is like a,
it's bad childhood.
Like it's not okay.

196
00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:58.120
<v 9>I have some people that the degradation is what really gets them going,
you know?</v>

197
00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.490
Yeah.
Hmm.
I Dunno.

198
00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:06.450
<v 6>Something for everybody.
Yep.
Same strokes,
same,
same
different,</v>

199
00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:07.540
same strategy.
Same phone.

200
00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:12.660
<v 9>I think
that is the same.
Everyone is the same everywhere.</v>

201
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:17.430
Uh,
but you're right.
The thing about,
I mean,

202
00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:22.490
no woman can fully grasp no how awful to 99% of men a ball kicking it.

203
00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.300
I mean,
you've never seen me.

204
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.350
I haven't getting kicked in the balls since I was a kid,
but you know,

205
00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:36.100
the dog can step on my balls and I'll be like,
I'm out of it for sure.

206
00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:39.280
<v 6>10 minutes.
Well,
or the kid can kick your nuts.
Yes.</v>

207
00:15:39.281 --> 00:15:44.020
You get really mad and it's extremely painful.
I know,
I know.

208
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.410
Yeah.

209
00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:49.410
But it's so weird that nature created that delicate part of you to be right out

210
00:15:49.551 --> 00:15:54.460
in,
in between your legs where they can hit and be,
you know,

211
00:15:54.461 --> 00:15:58.630
and,
and you know,
primitive man,
you used to run through the forest naked.

212
00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:02.050
What if you got your nuts snagged on a twig?
I'm sure it hire a Bushel.

213
00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.030
I'm sure it happened.
And why?

214
00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.640
It makes me uncomfortable just to fucking think about it,
man.

215
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.050
Running naked in the forest.

216
00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:13.210
<v 9>Primitive man.
Just to think about ball hitting,
you know?
Yeah.
There's,</v>

217
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:18.070
there's grazes sometimes your balls can get grazed.
Yeah.
And there's a delay.

218
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.990
Oh,
it hit my nuts.
I'm all right.
And then you're like,
oh.

219
00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:26.890
Like you feel it go up into inside your kidneys basically.
You're like,
ah,

220
00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.660
it takes you out.
And these guys are like,

221
00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.150
kick me as hard as you can in the balls.

222
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.530
<v 6>I know.
It's so good.</v>

223
00:16:32.531 --> 00:16:35.530
I know that they hang because they need to be kept a certain temperature.

224
00:16:35.531 --> 00:16:40.410
That's right.
Yeah.
But that just seems so stupid for a hunter gatherer.
Yeah.

225
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.590
To have to run with that delicate package in between your legs.
Let's see.

226
00:16:44.591 --> 00:16:45.130
I don't know.

227
00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.740
<v 0>The La is spread your legs.
Why?</v>

228
00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.140
Maybe because you like me.

229
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:57.700
Oh yeah,
yeah,

230
00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.530
yeah.
So

231
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.010
that's her.

232
00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:08.920
<v 6>No,
she too.
That's her girlish.
Listen to her</v>

233
00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.320
<v 9>fucking okay.
Listen,
listen.
That's hurt.
Hold on.</v>

234
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.600
You got to listen to this am

235
00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.610
<v 8>all right.
Cool.
Okay,</v>

236
00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:23.760
so fucking workload and you not in a habit.

237
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:25.223
Hey you.

238
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:26.640
<v 9>Hmm.
Okay.
Okay,</v>

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.880

240
00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.850
<v 9>That's her.
Maybe</v>

241
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.310
<v 0>so hot.</v>

242
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.950
<v 8>Oh yeah.
Maybe with the fucking shit.</v>

243
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.740
Wow.
Nothing.

244
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:49.150
What didn't you go on fucking kill yourself now I'm fucking face like,

245
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.950
and I don't fucking need you any more.

246
00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:56.170
<v 3>It's got like a British English sound to it.
Like she learning.
Yeah.</v>

247
00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.420
<v 0>Hot.
Hot.</v>

248
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.710
<v 3>Yeah,
you're right.
There it is.
It's the British.
Yeah.</v>

249
00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:05.750
<v 8>Yeah.
He'll fucking bitch</v>

250
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.450
Tommy my okay.

251
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:15.030
<v 3>Wow.
What a good ear.
You have master of accents.
You truly have earned your,</v>

252
00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:19.210
your award today.
Your Medal of honor for that one.
I am so proud of that.

253
00:18:19.211 --> 00:18:20.640
I didn't know this clip was coming by the way,

254
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:24.930
so I can really claim my throne today.
Wow.

255
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:29.790
Someone's got an ear.
Wow.
Wow.
Yeah.
Good for you.

256
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.290
Good for slack chatter.
We're not going to get to see it.
Um,
let me see.
I Dunno.

257
00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.780
<v 0>Get up against the law is spiritual lives.
This is,</v>

258
00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.810
<v 3>yeah.
Come on.
Let's see it.
You want to see some ball kicking?
Yeah,</v>

259
00:18:41.811 --> 00:18:45.980
we'll just have blue blur it or something.
Pixel it.
Well,
some of these,

260
00:18:45.981 --> 00:18:47.780
let's see if there's any clothed ones,

261
00:18:47.781 --> 00:18:51.950
because sometimes they do it with clothes on and sometimes,
but that's no fun.

262
00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:56.270
Or you want to see it naked.
Oh,
of course.
That's the funnest part.
Okay,
well,

263
00:18:56.271 --> 00:18:58.070
let's see.
I don't get to see the jiggle.

264
00:18:58.071 --> 00:19:01.940
You know why you fall to the ground is even better,
I think.

265
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:07.523
<v 2>Oh.</v>

266
00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:14.770
<v 3>Oh,
that's it.
This is a special one.
No,
that's the guy though.
Oh,
right.</v>

267
00:19:14.771 --> 00:19:16.190
That's why this looks familiar.
Yeah.

268
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:19.583
<v 0>Really?</v>

269
00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:32.150
No,
she's not fucking around.
It just makes me laugh,
but he,

270
00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:36.560
he enjoys this so much,
so absurd.
Why would you enjoy this?

271
00:19:36.561 --> 00:19:41.180
It's so weird.
No,
my life.

272
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:45.110
Oh No.
Jeez.
Of like,
oh,
this feels good.
And then

273
00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:56.090
give it a kick.
Yeah.
All right.
Now Open your mouth.

274
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:02.320
That's happening.
Cots.

275
00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.680
Jesus Christ.
Oh,

276
00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:14.020
<v 3>okay.
Okay.
What happened.
Okay.</v>

277
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:18.420
Naked like this is fully naked.
Isolate for the youtube,

278
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:22.870
but you can't deny the listeners.
All right.
Oh my God.
To see it.

280
00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.090

281
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.910
it's just a painter.

282
00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:46.730
This feeling,
is she missing teeth or their teeth too?

283
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.040
Really feel it.
Doing Balkan before.
Got a lot of cues from Scott.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.360
that is just so painful,
man.
Yeah.

287
00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.560
Not For me.
Not for you.
Huh?
I mean I would do it,

288
00:21:10.561 --> 00:21:15.561
but I would want to receive it if I were a boy and I don't have the standard Mo.

289
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.580
Oh yeah.
This is another thing too.

290
00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:22.530
This is a kicking or needing the balls as the guy orgasms.
Oh,

291
00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:25.710
let's see that one.
Jesus,

292
00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.220
There's ball stomping.

295
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.780
<v 6>Let's kind of,
I guess the pain wouldn't that</v>

296
00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:42.020
<v 3>you would think so?
Huh?
You would definitely think so.
But this is scientist.</v>

297
00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.950
You really want to see that.
Yes.
God.
What's wrong with you?

298
00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.360
Why you want to see this?
Okay.

299
00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:02.713

She's Naomi the balls.
See,

302
00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.280
<v 3>God is,
how does he come with that pain?</v>

303
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:19.690
You don't think you think that the body couldn't do both at once,
you know?
Oh.

304
00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:20.720
Then there's the,
uh,

305
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:25.750
there's people that really getting bays like smack the balls room.

306
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:33.703
Oh

307
00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.400
God,

It looks so painful.
Yeah,

308
00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:47.933
<v 0>Ooh.</v>

309
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.273

311
00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.160
Or He's on all fours and she could gotcha.

312
00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.173
It sounds like the three,

313
00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:32.510
<v 3>doesn't it?
Wow.</v>

314
00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:37.640
<v 6>You know why I like it so much?
I feel like it's the easiest Gig in porn.
Yeah.</v>

315
00:23:37.641 --> 00:23:39.350
Yeah.
You're,
it's just chill.
Like,
Oh,

316
00:23:39.351 --> 00:23:42.590
you want me to kick a dude's balls for 20 minutes?

317
00:23:42.591 --> 00:23:45.980
How much money does that to get paid to it?
That sounds like a

318
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.980
<v 3>real blessing.
That in the fart videos.
Oh,</v>

319
00:23:48.981 --> 00:23:53.150
I say that's like the easy way out of porn.
Oh,
that's what you're going to do.
Um,

320
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.020
you know as soon as I get off the road here,
you know,

321
00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.820
oh we're going to do this together or we're going to do porn.
No,
no.

322
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:05.540
You're going to do ball kicking and fart videos when I'm off the road.
Right,

323
00:24:05.541 --> 00:24:09.500
right.
Bring generates.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Get,

324
00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:14.000
get your own site started.
Probably easy.
Ah,
so easy.

325
00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:17.540
Oh who cares,
my mom's dead.
Doesn't matter.
There you go.

326
00:24:17.541 --> 00:24:21.880
You don't have anyone else in your life.
So who fears God?
I'm just looking at,

327
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.790
there's so many of these.
Okay.
Just pages and pages,
pages,

328
00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:30.230
all that interesting costing,
ball kicking.
Oh Man.

329
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:32.720
I saw one of these once where um,

330
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.540
they were doing the video and the girl was kicking him,

331
00:24:35.541 --> 00:24:39.320
kicking him and they had to get a replacement guy cause she,

332
00:24:39.321 --> 00:24:42.170
I think like ruptured one.
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

333
00:24:42.171 --> 00:24:45.950
It isn't there a massive health scare.
I mean,

334
00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:50.150
I can't imagine what a urologist would tell you if you're like,
so I'm doing,

335
00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.370
if I'm,
if you're a guy and you're like,

336
00:24:52.371 --> 00:24:55.360
I haven't signing up for these ball busting videos,
right.

337
00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.070
Punched and kicked in the balls and they'd be like,
ah.

338
00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:03.460
Well cause I've heard of guys where they're nuts flipped and they twist

339
00:25:03.531 --> 00:25:07.940
essentially.
Right.
And that's very painful.
You don't want that to happen.

340
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:12.380
That can happen real easy doing this.
Yeah.
It happened during a baseball,

341
00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:17.440
he was squatting down to catch a baseball and his nuts twisted around.

342
00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.600
Oh yeah,
they flipped.
There's uh,

343
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:23.690
there's one here where a lady's got on boxing gloves

344
00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:30.160
and I think that a guide we live in,

345
00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:33.640
the big guys like the star of,
of,
you know,
I think he's,
he's the guy.

346
00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:37.400
He's a hero in that world.
Yeah.
Cause then they can't be too many out there.

347
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:41.910
I also imagine that if you shoot those,
um,
you,

348
00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:46.700
you also have like weeks off between them.
You know,
he got it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

349
00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:49.220
To recover,
right?
Yeah.
This video's is called,

350
00:25:49.221 --> 00:25:51.530
I bet you he can't come with broken balls.

351
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.750
Who gets to title the videos?
That's what I wonder,
man.

352
00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.590
I don't know what a great job this is.

353
00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:03.740
This is so painful looking though Jesus.
All right.

354
00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.193
<v 10>Try that line.</v>

355
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:16.650
<v 3>Maybe you can try that line.
Okay,
let's go.
I want to hear it again.
All right,</v>

356
00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.450
hold on.
Here we go.

357
00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.860
Maybe because you like being kicked in the,

358
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:25.990
<v 10>oh,</v>

359
00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:28.220
<v 3>that's really good.
Yeah.
You have to do it.
Yeah.</v>

360
00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:30.490
<v 0>Yeah.
I guess the law is spreadsheet.</v>

361
00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:35.010
<v 3>Do a bad,
yeah.
We can't be too sincere like acting right yet.</v>

362
00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.990
Get up against the wall.
Spread your legs.
Yeah.

363
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.730
It'd be like over the top with it because you're going to be so good at this.

364
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:46.260
<v 7>That's why I'm just going to keep him nice and hard.
Right in the balls.</v>

365
00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:51.240
<v 3>That's why I'm getting kick it nice and hard.
Right in the balls.</v>

366
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:55.040
Remember that HBO thing,
that girl that did like the,

367
00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:59.800
the behind the scenes,
you know,
like the sex answers.

368
00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:04.300
Remember on HBO is wonderful.
Kate,
Katy Perry,

369
00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:08.920
Katy Perry,
Katy Perry hosted this thing.

370
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:13.160
I'm on Hbo and she was like,
yeah.
The thing about pornos you just,
uh,

371
00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:18.280
it's like yes.
Ending,
right?
Yeah.
That's good.

372
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:25.633
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

373
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:34.890
<v 3>Yeah,
yeah.
I'd be real mean about it.
I don't think I could fake the,</v>

374
00:27:34.891 --> 00:27:38.480
the joy.
I just be like,
coming me,
fuck,
fuck boy.
You know,

375
00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.040
I think they would like an ear scam.

376
00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:44.750
Fuck these guys like definitely like the GG Allen School of yeah,

377
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:46.400
these guys were like fucking dummy

378
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:54.040
fucking dummy.
There you go.

379
00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.460
Oh,
she's got it down for sure.
Um,

380
00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:02.050
I had a lot of fun and uh,
one thing,

381
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:07.560
excuse me,
that I got to do.
Where is it?
I had it all queued up.
Stand up.

382
00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:10.810
Stand up.
Stand them up Stan.

383
00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:15.640
I've actually had to stop using that word because I can't figure out if its

384
00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:17.730
stamina or making fun of it.
Yeah.

385
00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:21.100
I was trying to make fun of it too and I thought I was saying it wrong.

386
00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:25.810
If it's too close,
yes and no,
I,
I fucked it up.

387
00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:32.230
I have to hear him say it to know that that's wrong because now stamina sounds

388
00:28:32.231 --> 00:28:35.360
wrong.
Like stamina,
stamina.

389
00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:39.280
It's like when we made fun of all those words and then it gets stuck that way

390
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:40.733
regardless.

391
00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:45.320
Library pacifically pacifically stand them up.

392
00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:49.870
See what standing with sales right now to me when,
uh,
we were looking at homes,

393
00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:54.760
one of the ladies that was showing us a home goes,
I go to this room,
be,
she goes,

394
00:28:54.761 --> 00:28:56.020
you could use it as a library.

395
00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:00.003
Stand them up.

396
00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:07.840
I had a lot of fun in the Ma and then I even got to go have some fun on the

397
00:29:09.071 --> 00:29:09.670
morning.
Yeah.

398
00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:14.560
<v 12>Oh it's a garage or a DJ?
Dad Mouth.
Aka duct tape.</v>

399
00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:20.020
Duct tape.
Duct tape.
How'd you get that?
People call me duck tape man.

400
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.790
Cause I always have it on me.
You know,
like macgyver.

401
00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.580
I'll duct tape your mouth shut.
I'll just,

402
00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:31.600
anywhere that you have a hole on you,
I'll put duct tape.

403
00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.950
So I'm going to do it up tonight.
I didn't realize that morning.

404
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.320
A lot of color options.

405
00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.300
Duct tape.
Is this a guy thing?

406
00:29:46.301 --> 00:29:50.250
Is that we just adored duct tape so much?
Or what,

407
00:29:50.251 --> 00:29:54.480
what is the fascination with,
with tape?
So this is a jail thing.
Really dancing.

408
00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:58.750
Oh please,
please tell us.
Warm.
Just a buddy of mine,

409
00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:03.670
he got locked up for armed kidnapping and then he,
uh,

410
00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:07.930
everybody had like a nickname in prison and he found some duct tape so they

411
00:30:07.931 --> 00:30:10.450
called him doc tape.
I'm just trying to,

412
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:15.400
I want to free my buddy duct tape free doctors.
Free Duck tape.
Free Dog.

413
00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:20.860
He for awhile he has,
you know,
it's a 20 year sentence,

414
00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:25.030
but the thing is there's good behavior and there's appeals and if everything

415
00:30:25.031 --> 00:30:27.800
goes right,
I think duct tape,
it'll be out in seven free dog tape.

416
00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:33.100
Here's the thing,
I feel like if you commit armed kidnapping,

417
00:30:33.101 --> 00:30:36.160
but it's during a drug deal that it's not like,

418
00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:38.530
like there was other people doing bad things anyways.

419
00:30:38.531 --> 00:30:40.670
They should give you a little bit of leniency on that.
You know,

420
00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.870
it's not like he kidnapped a kid.
He can't have a bad dude.

421
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.200
So he essentially,
it took someone off the street,

422
00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:53.590
they couldn't find chewy for like,
I don't know,
three weeks or something.

423
00:30:53.591 --> 00:30:57.190
So that's three weeks that she wasn't selling a cocaine.

424
00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:00.880
Here you go free,
dark yellow.

425
00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.900
Yeah,
of course.
I got a dog.
I put it in her purse.
Stay tuned folks,

426
00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:08.860
because we have got to do,
got a duck tape,
something to follow you on Twitter at,

427
00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:11.003
at to grow.

428
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:16.500
And I will tweet out the location of the after party and we will wreck a place.

429
00:31:16.691 --> 00:31:19.030
We will physically destroy this place out.

430
00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:22.180
Duct tape it all back to yeah and that's exactly what I do man.

431
00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:25.390
We tear it down and then I put it back together back together.
Man.

432
00:31:25.391 --> 00:31:26.650
You get my home's concept.

433
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:38.040
Someone's never been to your show
besides duct tape.

434
00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:41.990
What can people expect?
Not like an x rated show,
but it's like all rated.

435
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.280
It's probably are rated for adults to come out and have a great time over a

436
00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.120
drink some food and enjoy your crazy thing.

437
00:31:49.121 --> 00:31:53.750
You're going to switch your name to scotch tape and not know duct tape.
No,
no,

438
00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:56.890
no,
no.
Cause I'm going to honor duct tape until he gets out.

439
00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:01.920
Free doc tape free or your comic mentors.

440
00:32:03.761 --> 00:32:06.460
Like who did you look up to as a young kid?
And he's like,
you know what,

441
00:32:06.461 --> 00:32:09.580
someday I'm going to do that.
Uh,
it changed,
you know,

442
00:32:09.581 --> 00:32:11.770
like when I was like a young,
young kid,

443
00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:16.000
I feel like it started off with a Cosby.

444
00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:19.060
He's got a little bit of legal trouble himself.

445
00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:24.000
He should get some duckies in bubble wrap and some duct tape a long time ago.

446
00:32:24.001 --> 00:32:25.920
No,
you should not have had decayed

447
00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:31.500
thanks a lot for those crimes.
Uh,

448
00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:36.070
I then I liked the TPM away from the duct tape.

449
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:39.770
Not,
not here.
Keep Cosby away from the duck tape.

450
00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:44.530
It's all kinds of things going on here.
There's a lot of good comedians

451
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:49.920
like free duct tape,
duct tape.
Go ask the day.

452
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:54.500
<v 3>Alright.
There you go.
How long was that?
Did that feel super long?</v>

453
00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.560
What do you mean the video with them?
Yeah.
Oh,
talking to them.
Oh,

454
00:32:57.561 --> 00:33:00.380
I did it half an hour with them.
That,
oh my God,
that was,

455
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:04.320
that was edited down to three.
Hilarious.
I also did the weather going to,

456
00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:07.020
we have a weather video.
Okay.
Let's see.
Um,

457
00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:09.920
were doing the Lord's work on these morning shows,
you know that right?

458
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:13.980
Really Fun man.
Yeah,
they're just so unwatchable until you come off.
Um,

459
00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:18.080
I wish you did all morning shows.
It's really fun to,
Oh,

460
00:33:18.081 --> 00:33:22.300
we gotta talk about Corey Feldman going on the today show.
My God.
Yeah.

461
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.940
Do you want to see whether first,
yeah,
yeah,
of course.
I did some weather stuff.

462
00:33:25.941 --> 00:33:30.941
Where is that speaking of inappropriate though on morning shows that Corey

463
00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:36.320
Feldman thing was fucking,
that was crazy.
Yeah.
Oh,

464
00:33:36.321 --> 00:33:39.860
I'd never thought duct tape would be so giving,
you know it's crazy.
Yeah,
yeah,

465
00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:40.753
yeah.

466
00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:45.140
<v 12>Hey everybody.
Welcome back Cwi while I'm worried.
Sure.</v>

467
00:33:45.141 --> 00:33:50.141
I'm James Peterson back on my side here in front of the weather wall with duck

468
00:33:50.441 --> 00:33:55.060
tape.
Mr Secura.
What's that man?
We wanted to come and pee.

469
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:56.570
He wanted to come in front of the chrome.
Well,

470
00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:58.270
he's ever stood in front of a green walls.

471
00:33:58.271 --> 00:34:02.580
A few folks at home don't know this is called a chroma key green screen green

472
00:34:02.581 --> 00:34:05.970
screen.
I'm gonna let,
we'll let him do the weather.
I'm going to step out of here.

473
00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:09.180
He's got to tell you about the rainfall.
Let's talk about rain real quick.

474
00:34:09.181 --> 00:34:14.181
Man Over here in Cedar rapids here maybe gotten a little over and it says

475
00:34:14.551 --> 00:34:19.490
nothing.
Spencer,
man,
y'all are wet mess.

476
00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:23.850
So easy.
What does this deck,
Decorah.
Dick.
Cora.
Cora,

477
00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:26.040
they're not even no rain or they use,
just felt lazy.

478
00:34:26.041 --> 00:34:29.760
You didn't put like putting into the total is Waterloo.

479
00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:35.100
There's other places I got duct tape for decor.

480
00:34:35.101 --> 00:34:38.850
I'm not going to put on the wall but here I would cover this up

481
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:46.180
cause you guys disrespected the Cora and you also disrespected Davenport.
Yeah.

482
00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.870
And let's see what else we got.
We're going to,
we're gonna show the Skycam.

483
00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:54.280
Oh Sky Cam.
Oh look at this.
We'd like to thank our sponsors at or in homes.

484
00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:59.650
If you're looking for a house and you have money contact or in homes and they'll

485
00:34:59.651 --> 00:35:03.470
help you get it.
And if something breaks,
we'll put duct tape on.

486
00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:08.490
It is currently 63 here and the conditions are fair,

487
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:13.210
somewhat sunny,
cloudy.
You watch this,

488
00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:17.620
watch this little trick was this bullshit shit.
If you're sweating,

489
00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:21.550
it's not helping matters.
93% humidity.

490
00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:24.850
It is muggy outside.
The winds are coming out of the west,

491
00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:28.690
southwest around six miles an hour.
If you don't have duct tape,

492
00:35:28.691 --> 00:35:31.840
make sure you pick them up today.
It solves so many issues.

493
00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:38.670
The core is not there on this one either.
While they're having technical issues,

494
00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.720
the technical problem,
the technical,
it is a good idea to bring out the duck.
Yes,

495
00:35:42.721 --> 00:35:45.410
you could.
You could duck tape over them and we'll just get back to that.

496
00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:49.920
Might have blue gaffers tape.
Here's your future tracker.

497
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:54.450
All refugee tracker.
I'm gonna put,
I'm a let you play with

498
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:57.063
Chicago.

499
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:02.900
There's water there and the Minneapolis is snowing very hard right now.

500
00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:07.740
And also in Kansas City there's a lot of snow in fire.

501
00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:10.440
A future trackers,

502
00:36:10.441 --> 00:36:14.500
letting you know that there's some rain and mixed in other things.
Uh,

503
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:19.190
or in homes.
Doesn't sponsor this segment.
Anything else?
All right.
No,

504
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.540
we're gonna walk back over here.
Dr Tape.

505
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:25.960
<v 6>Very good.
Yeah.
Very Fun.
Dj Dad Mouth.</v>

506
00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.930
You did a really good thank you that you should do that all the time.

507
00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:32.290
It's fun to do morning news when they're fun.

508
00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:35.860
They really let you have free reign in Iowa.
Huh?
They were fun.
Yeah.

509
00:36:35.861 --> 00:36:38.440
Those two were really good time.
That was.
That was definitely fun.
See,

510
00:36:38.441 --> 00:36:41.410
now I like I,
oh,
I changed my mind.
So you have a good time there.
Yeah.

511
00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:44.920
Does that make you not want to go on as yourself though?
Yeah,

512
00:36:44.921 --> 00:36:49.210
I'm not sure what I would do now if I,
if I were go on those terrible shows,

513
00:36:49.211 --> 00:36:52.750
you know?
Yeah.
Don't call their sheer terror.
I mean really awesome,
relevant

514
00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:59.560
hip veggie doing work,
doing the Lord's work.

515
00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:03.790
I used to bring fif on television with me just then they,

516
00:37:03.791 --> 00:37:07.380
they got a real kick out of seeing the dog.
But I don't know.

517
00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:12.910
I don't know if I could do a character.
Let's see.
A,
you want to see,

518
00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:18.990
oh my God.
So it says,
oh my God,
there is late.

519
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:24.030
I'm sorry you sent me this thing when you sent me a Corey Feldman.

520
00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:27.790
Oh fuck.

521
00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:32.620
Well my friend Mary Lynn texted me first thing on,

522
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:35.860
I forget,
maybe Friday morning,
Saturday morning.
And she's like,

523
00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.600
have you seen this yet?

524
00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:43.560
And I mean the Internet exploded with people and I feel like we don't usually

525
00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:47.080
touch these big important stories.
Yeah.
You know?

526
00:37:47.081 --> 00:37:49.910
But this was so weird.
Like,

527
00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:55.090
I feel like we need to really get into it and analyze what is happening here.

528
00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:56.380
Yeah.
Uh,

529
00:37:56.410 --> 00:38:01.410
cause so Corey Feldman went on the today show and he's been making music since,

530
00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:07.460
you know,
the late eighties,
early nineties.
Did you know that,
that he went on,
um,

531
00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:12.600
like Howard Stern's television show and sang a song in 1992 about like the youth

532
00:38:13.661 --> 00:38:18.190
of today and stuff.
It was so weird.
No.
So you know,
he's a,

533
00:38:18.191 --> 00:38:21.820
you text that to me or did you think I texted it to the world?
Yeah,

534
00:38:21.821 --> 00:38:26.320
I texted it to everybody.
Or was that a text?
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.

535
00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:31.840
Anyways.
Um,
so hey,
I just got a phantom tax.
You know how you get them to yeah,

536
00:38:31.841 --> 00:38:35.080
I got one the other day too.
What is your say?
Mine says is,

537
00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:39.490
is this someone trying to reach dean?
My old Stepdad.

538
00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:40.803
I Dunno.

539
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:42.950
<v 0>Huh?
Huh?</v>

540
00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:46.870
<v 6>Can I finish my,
oh,
sorry.
I got one that's the other day that says thanks.</v>

541
00:38:46.871 --> 00:38:51.190
We finished 10 minutes ago.
Smiley face.
No,
no clue.
And then did you write back,

542
00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:55.930
how hard did you come?
I should have.
Why didn't I,

543
00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:59.920
it would have been great.
I mean,
I fucking miss my shots.
So anyways,

544
00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:02.740
Corey Feldman,
his mentor was Michael Jackson.

545
00:39:02.741 --> 00:39:06.490
We all know that it's here.
Yeah.

546
00:39:06.491 --> 00:39:10.630
He was a celebrity kid and he hung out with Mj.
By the way,
did you hear that?

547
00:39:10.631 --> 00:39:15.631
Someone came out and finally said that Michael Jackson did sexually abuse him as

548
00:39:15.911 --> 00:39:19.150
a child,
but because of the statute of limitations on it,

549
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:20.950
they can't press any kind of charges.

550
00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:26.320
There's a statute of limitations I think you need limits on,
I know,

551
00:39:26.321 --> 00:39:29.050
right?
Yeah.
But the guy said that he was,
you know,

552
00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.630
I dunno why he didn't come out so long.

553
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:34.810
I imagine the shame of being molested and,
and whatever the feelings.
But,

554
00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:38.890
so the guy finally came out and said that yes.
An MJ.

555
00:39:38.891 --> 00:39:42.820
What he would do is have his assistant reach out to these families.
Yeah.

556
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:47.290
And be like,
Hey,
do you want to come hang out at Neverland?
And then he would,

557
00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.100
you know,
show them the roller coasters and all the cool stuff.

558
00:39:51.101 --> 00:39:55.360
And the parents would hang out with Mj and he would win their trust.

559
00:39:55.361 --> 00:39:57.700
Kind of like,
you know,
oh,
isn't it great?

560
00:39:57.701 --> 00:40:02.080
And then he would have the assistant reach out to the parents and ask if their

561
00:40:02.081 --> 00:40:06.100
kid could come to Neverland and spend the night.
Right.

562
00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:10.510
And then these idiot parents would let their kids spend the night with Michael

563
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:12.010
Jackson.
Of course he was molesting.

564
00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:16.000
Doesn't it seem crazy now to think that people were like,
no,

565
00:40:16.001 --> 00:40:18.550
he's not doing that.
Of course he's not.

566
00:40:18.551 --> 00:40:20.470
He just likes to sleep with young children.

567
00:40:20.471 --> 00:40:25.120
He just likes to sleep with little boys like he's just a kid at heart.
No,

568
00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:29.350
I chose you to how people let logic go when someone's really fabulous.
Well,

569
00:40:29.351 --> 00:40:31.700
when they really love Mike,
I loved Michael Jackson.

570
00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:35.080
They love him because he's so talented and famous by saying,
yeah,

571
00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:39.070
if he just was like,
Oh,
you're that Guy Michael.

572
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:44.170
He works at the craft store hardware,
sleeping with kids.
He'd be like,

573
00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.160
yeah.
All right,
well he's going to spend the night with your children.
No,
no,

574
00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:50.830
he's not.
Or you having a hard time finding this?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Um,

575
00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:53.720
do you want me to find it?
Press pause for a minute.
Yeah.

576
00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.153
<v 0>Right.</v>

577
00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:59.660
<v 6>All right.
We're bad.
We got it.
Um,
oh man.
Buckle up guys,</v>

578
00:40:59.661 --> 00:41:00.800
if you haven't heard this,

579
00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:05.690
this is Corey Feldman on the today show on the today show.
And by the way,

580
00:41:05.691 --> 00:41:10.450
you can see like even at this point,
yes.
The Michael Jackson influence,

581
00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:13.310
you know,
you can see the insanity ramping up.

582
00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:15.800
Like you can tell that Cory's off.

583
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:20.180
He's got a hood on like a dark hoodie and you can see the look in his eye isn't

584
00:41:20.181 --> 00:41:21.440
normal.
It's not normal.

585
00:41:21.441 --> 00:41:26.130
It's that Michael always had like very distinct,
uh,

586
00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:28.610
and white and black was always his thing.
You know,
like a,

587
00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:31.880
and you can see that that's,
that's what he's going on coming here.

588
00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:35.450
I felt like the cover Angelica or

589
00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:40.630
<v 9>is him coming out of the earth wearing black and there's fire and there's</v>

590
00:41:40.631 --> 00:41:42.160
angels,
but it looks

591
00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:46.270
<v 6>Jorge Angels.
Right.
But it also looks like $2 cover art,</v>

592
00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.140
like at the mall.
Do you remember,

593
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:53.110
<v 9>you probably weren't into this,
but in the 90s when um,</v>

594
00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:54.420
like that there was,

595
00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:59.380
there's this southern Shondra of hip hop really exploded all their cover

596
00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:03.970
harmony.
No,
that's not southern
thugs.

597
00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:08.530
No,
it looks like it looks like what?
Like,
um,

598
00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:12.990
like uh,
making say,
uh,
like all those guys,
they're covered.

599
00:42:12.991 --> 00:42:17.991
Ours was like tanks and like just I guy in a goal like juvenile and them and I

600
00:42:18.581 --> 00:42:20.380
can't even think of his name,
but um,

601
00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:23.400
<v 6>wait,
wait,
wait.
But you know what?
I like it.</v>

602
00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:27.030
This is like gang banger art where it's and Jelly number two,

603
00:42:27.031 --> 00:42:31.530
that Gore and it's got that like,
yeah,
handwriting font,

604
00:42:31.531 --> 00:42:34.770
whatever that cursive font.
It looks like it was made at the mall,
Dude.

605
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:39.170
<v 9>Yeah.
Here's the master p album covers.
Okay.
Like,
yeah,</v>

606
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:42.320
here's this is,
yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

607
00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:45.610
All those looked like that back in the 90s.

608
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:50.540
<v 6>And the angels are dressed like prostitutes.
They got garter belts on.</v>

609
00:42:50.541 --> 00:42:53.150
They all dress like sluts,
sled angels,

610
00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:59.540
like the Halloween Costume version for women.
This is like what all these,

611
00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:04.430
oh right,
right.
Yeah.
That's a lot better.

612
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:06.343
Well

613
00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:14.720
I,
it's hard to describe but if there was a lot of fire and flame,

614
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:19.730
it's like cheap shit.
It's like a dude just learned,

615
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:23.270
not even like whatever was before Photoshop when they were like,

616
00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:28.470
hey put a tank in there.
But that's a fire to fire in there.
It's,

617
00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:32.510
it's that bad.
It's really fair.
It's worse than that.
It really is.

618
00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.700
It is garbage.
But if you're,

619
00:43:34.701 --> 00:43:39.140
if you're debuting like a hip cool song is the today show where you do it?

620
00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:40.730
Well you do it when you're a pop star.

621
00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:45.620
<v 9>All those little like Katy Perry who does those pornos and like,
uh,
um,</v>

622
00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:47.580
you know like uh yeah whatever.

623
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:50.180
<v 6>Whoever the famous singers are Dave,</v>

624
00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:53.240
they do these morning cause they know there's millions of viewers.

625
00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.990
How did he get on here?
Do you think you had a publicist or somebody,

626
00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:59.450
obviously there's some hookup where maybe somebody saw it and they're like,

627
00:43:59.451 --> 00:44:03.230
do you want to see something go viral for the wrong reasons?

628
00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:06.370
Well that someone the book or got fired immediately.
I Dunno.

629
00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:11.000
Maybe promoted cause think about how many views the thing,
here's the thing,

630
00:44:11.001 --> 00:44:13.340
the music's not that shitty.

631
00:44:13.341 --> 00:44:17.090
Like how is that any shittier than the shitty things they play on the radio.

632
00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:22.040
That's just a shitty as anything else.
I think it's the,
it's the dancing.

633
00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:26.840
It's like,
you know,
in a six year old is like,
Mommy,
mommy,

634
00:44:26.841 --> 00:44:31.390
watch me dance.
Mommy,
look,
look at my dance mommy.
That's what he's doing.
Yeah.

635
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:32.100
Where it's like,
look

636
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:36.510
<v 3>at,
look at my dance moves,
mom,
watch me dive three,
dive mommy.
And I was like,</v>

637
00:44:36.511 --> 00:44:39.410
I'm watching,
I'm watching you.
Yeah.
Um,

638
00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:44.110
I already can't do this.
What's going on?
I Dunno.

639
00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:47.580
So there we go back here.

640
00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:51.000
I wanted to pull up something else to show you at the same time as this was

641
00:44:51.001 --> 00:44:53.910
playing,
um,
here,
maybe here I can do it,

642
00:44:55.830 --> 00:45:00.360
but there's cause it kind of a,
it kind of made me reminded me of something else.

643
00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:05.400
I also like the host who's like,
uh,
I had a Corey Feldman poster on my wall.
Like,

644
00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:06.890
wait,
you're a dude though,

645
00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:10.920
unless you like dude's did you have other dudes on your wall growing up?
Really?

646
00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:13.280
Doesn't this give you a little bit of a reminder of

647
00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:21.080
<v 0>[inaudible]?</v>

648
00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:27.270
<v 3>It's just a Shitty,
is that,
yeah.
I mean,
which the Shittier,
oh,
definitely.
Uh,</v>

649
00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.350
Nick Hawk,
I think they cock is the worst

650
00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:31.153
<v 0>is</v>

651
00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:35.500
<v 3>yes.
Not that's what I'm trying to say.
It's not that shitty.
It's not that bad.
No,</v>

652
00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:39.220
you just heard it.
You'd be like,
Eh,
it's an a,
it's not,
I mean,

653
00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:41.380
I'm not going to buy this,
but I'd be like,
it's all right.

654
00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:46.420
But the absurdity is the dance and that it's him and the dancing.

655
00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.740
The dancing is outrageous.

656
00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:55.050
He even is rocking.
What ended up being a Michael Jackson style of hair.

657
00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:56.300
You realize that?
Yeah,

658
00:45:56.530 --> 00:46:00.340
but I mean Michael Jackson rock that there was a point where he had long hair.

659
00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:03.520
He combed it back here.
We kind of pinned it back and then less some loss.

660
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:08.590
It's a direct style suck.
But he's like,
that's my idol or whatever,

661
00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:09.040
you know.

662
00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:14.040
But very much Korey always chose late eighties MJ versus the early to mid.

663
00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:20.800
I always thought this was Mj is least attractive era.

664
00:46:20.801 --> 00:46:24.330
I like shorter heaven later.
This is like a lady.
Yeah,

665
00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:29.230
mid nineties look like black or white.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Interesting.
Yeah,

666
00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:33.130
he really,
and the reason I think so many people made fun of him after this,

667
00:46:33.131 --> 00:46:36.890
besides how bad it is,
and you can tell how sincere he isn't it.
But I like that.

668
00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:40.840
So I know.
No,
I'm not faulting him for it.

669
00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:45.220
But when you see someone trying really hard and it doesn't go well,
then they go,

670
00:46:45.221 --> 00:46:49.380
they come in on your heart.
He probably has been just tortured since this.
Well,

671
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:53.470
you'd think that and you'd think that he may throw in the towel,
but he hasn't.

672
00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:55.900
And like he's been shit on a lot.

673
00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:59.960
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

674
00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:05.380
<v 3>wings,
angels,
they love that Shit.
But he tweeted out,</v>

675
00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:08.110
he's like,
I guess you know,
everyone's talking about us.

676
00:47:08.111 --> 00:47:11.460
I guess the angels and I did our job.
Like he doesn't,
I dunno,

677
00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:15.460
there's something here that says it's really not going out going well.
Oh really?

678
00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:18.280
Cause Corey Feldman sobs,
aw.

679
00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:22.090
While speaking out against today's show reaction were petrified to even go out.

680
00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:26.110
And he says it's the experience becomes something to hide.

681
00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:30.070
Like I think there's a video of it.
It got,
let's see.

682
00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:35.160
<v 9>He has not been able to get out of bed after the person.
Oh No.
Yeah.</v>

683
00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:37.810
This is this fifth album.

684
00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:41.350
<v 6>I know.
That's what I'm,
that's what I'm thinking is that maybe it's time to,</v>

685
00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:43.930
you know,
throw in the towel here,

686
00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:47.210
<v 9>man.
This is,
um,
Ooh.</v>

687
00:47:47.330 --> 00:47:52.070
<v 6>Well,
what's going on here?
What,
what do you think is,
well,
how does this happen?</v>

688
00:47:52.071 --> 00:47:55.970
Is what I'm trying to ask you from a,
an emotional,

689
00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:59.660
did a Facebook live posts responding to his critics?
Oh,

690
00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:04.700
doors now infamous performance on the today show.
Friday he debuted his new song,

691
00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:05.540
go for it,

692
00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:10.410
and the appearance received a bit of backlash and is now deleted posts.

693
00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:11.263
He said,
quote,

694
00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:16.250
all we can say is that we tried really hard because we love our fans and we just

695
00:48:16.251 --> 00:48:18.260
wanted to give them the best show that we could,

696
00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:21.860
but we don't deserve these things that are being said about us are awful.

697
00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:26.030
Feldman was a popular teen actor in the 80s he started in the Goonies and the

698
00:48:26.031 --> 00:48:27.020
lost boys.

699
00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:29.450
<v 9>Wow.
There you go.</v>

700
00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:35.240
<v 6>You know what I think it might be because he got famous so young that it's like</v>

701
00:48:35.241 --> 00:48:37.010
kind of an arrested development thing.

702
00:48:37.011 --> 00:48:40.710
Like he stopped developing it like six years old.
Yeah.
You know,

703
00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:42.110
and he's kind of stuck in this

704
00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:48.280
<v 9>age.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It says,
um,
it is delusional though.</v>

705
00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:50.770
It is delusional and I dunno,
I mean,

706
00:48:50.771 --> 00:48:53.770
I think you know what the other thing is too is that you can almost blame the

707
00:48:53.771 --> 00:48:57.400
today show.
Like if he had just made a video for this or something,
it wouldn't,

708
00:48:57.401 --> 00:49:01.780
yeah.
But he's on the today show.
This is like part of it.
Like they fucking,

709
00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:06.070
this is the thing where they go,
oh,
Rihanna has a new thing.

710
00:49:06.071 --> 00:49:09.820
She's going to do it on the today show.
And they put him in that series.
Wow.

711
00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:12.640
That's really weird of them to do that.
You know,

712
00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:17.260
he said it's been really painful.
I don't,

713
00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:20.260
sorry if it's not good enough for you,
but you don't have to beat us up.

714
00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:24.670
Well look at us participating in the beating up.
Well,
yeah.

715
00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:29.870
<v 6>It was just such a shock.
It really was like such a weird thing for me.</v>

716
00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:33.770
Yeah.
It was just like,
what do you,
I don't know man.
What's happening?

717
00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:38.260
<v 9>Yeah.
No,
it's really bad.
This is really bad.
Yeah.</v>

718
00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:43.240
Um,
the dancing is really good.
We see more dance moves.
So I liked the dancing.

719
00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:46.750
Yeah.
He's doing his,
uh,

720
00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:51.370
his,
his little,
yeah.
I got to play the song.
Oh,
okay.

721
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:55.230
I thought you wanted to mute it to not to not shit on him for Oh,

722
00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:58.020
there if you were trying to dance like Michael Jackson.
Yeah.

723
00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:01.300
And they would teach you in stages,
you know,
like,
well,
let's first do this.

724
00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.150
He's doing like stage two,
right of,

725
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:06.430
of learning how to do it right now they're light,
right.

726
00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:11.800
They're clearly amateur.
Michael,
like entry level moves.

727
00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:15.970
Yeah.
He's like,
he loves Michael Jackson.
He can't do Michael Jackson moves.
Yeah.

728
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.860
So he's doing,
you know,
little things that our dance class,
yeah.
It's like he's,

729
00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:23.530
you could see the little moves.
He just,
all the stuff and Michael Jackson did.

730
00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:24.923
Thank you.

731
00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:28.330
<v 6>That's totally MBA stuff.
Yeah.
All of the</v>

732
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.710
<v 3>foot.
Yeah.
But he does it like a six year old.
Right,
right.</v>

733
00:50:30.711 --> 00:50:33.720
And that's not a doing Michael Jackson.
That's not good.
Wow.

734
00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:38.110
That's so interesting.
I don't want the guy to kill himself or anything,
so no,

735
00:50:38.290 --> 00:50:40.970
it is just give up music,

736
00:50:43.810 --> 00:50:48.350
hang out,
just give up your dreams.
No,
that's terrible.

737
00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:52.820
It must be hard to have this desire in you so much.

738
00:50:52.821 --> 00:50:56.210
Like I want to be a singer so bad,
but you're really terrible at it.
Yeah.

739
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:58.880
And you just keep failing and failing,
but then you,

740
00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:02.600
you listened to the secret or you listen to Tony Robbins and they're like,

741
00:51:02.601 --> 00:51:06.110
keep going no matter what.
And he was like,
yeah,
I'm going to keep going.

742
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:09.170
Maybe not throwing the towel,

743
00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:15.140
you know,
um,
moving right along.
Yeah.

744
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:19.490
Can I ask you your advice on something or can I pick your brain on something?

745
00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:20.343
Yeah.

746
00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:25.720
So on a Friday I had lunch with a friend and I had a kale salad with salmon

747
00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:33.530
and then I had violent diarrhea for like the next day I just had really hot,

748
00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:36.590
sour diarrhea.
Are you listening to me

749
00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:41.420
anyways?
Here's what I noticed happening.

750
00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:45.320
Are you paying attention?
You have to pay attention to me.

751
00:51:45.321 --> 00:51:46.880
Look at me when I'm talking to him,
please.

752
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:52.630
I was pooping and it was really hot and it burned a lot and I noticed that every

753
00:51:54.051 --> 00:51:58.010
time I'm done making diarrhea,
I have to pee.

754
00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:03.080
It's lot a lot like the yellow,
brown,
yellow phenomenon,

755
00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:07.430
but this time,
every time they have diarrhea,
I have to pee afterwards.

756
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:13.290
Okay,
but why?
I mean,

757
00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:18.110
I dunno.
I think your body's just getting rid of everything.
How has that weird?

758
00:52:18.111 --> 00:52:20.990
I don't understand.
It's weird because when I sit down to Brown,

759
00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:26.210
I make pee all the time.
Like I already pee before Brown,
so I'm empty,

760
00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:30.030
but then why would I make the area?
There's always a yellow there.

761
00:52:30.031 --> 00:52:32.960
I'm sure it's really good question.

762
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:37.140
I'm going to call a doctor or something.
I do.

763
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:42.260
You don't have that.
Maybe that's just a girl thing.
I think maybe you're right.

764
00:52:42.261 --> 00:52:45.680
I think maybe you're just so focused on when you have diarrhea,

765
00:52:45.681 --> 00:52:50.570
it's more like your brain's like,
oh shit,
this is real,
you know,
not normal.

766
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:55.150
Then maybe you hold your pee a little bit and then when you brown that out you

767
00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:58.270
relax more and your body goes,
No,
let the pee out too.

768
00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:05.720
I feel like it's something to do with heat.
Your body losing he or something.

769
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:09.050
This is a really interesting,
this is the thing,
you're like,
hey,

770
00:53:09.051 --> 00:53:11.180
let me bring this up.
They didn't want to tell me earlier.
You're like,

771
00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:13.580
I got something I got to talk about.
That's it.

772
00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:19.220
That's really good.
That's really good.
But I'm serious.

773
00:53:19.221 --> 00:53:21.710
You're not taking it serious.
I'm taking it really seriously.

774
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:26.430
It's maybe it's your loss of body heat and then like the peak gets made.
Yeah.

775
00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:30.130
Um,
Oh,
you know what?
Uh,
it may be that,
isn't it?

776
00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:32.910
It's really interesting and I think we should explore it more.

777
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:35.380
Maybe some other time.
Um,

778
00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:38.830
but I don't think it's heat leaving your body.

779
00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:41.970
I feel like my body heat leaves when you have diarrhea,
you know?

780
00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:45.660
Can I tell you the worst thing you've ever done?
Yeah,
I wrote it down.
Okay.

781
00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:50.370
You called me the other day as you were eating veggie chips from the trader's

782
00:53:50.371 --> 00:53:54.800
Joe.
Yeah.
On speaker phone.
Yeah,
that was terrible fly.
Just horrible.

783
00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:58.530
I was hungry.
I hated it.
The why.
What was terrible?

784
00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:02.530
I Dunno.
What was terrible?
The sounds the sounds.
Yeah.

785
00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:04.240
That sounds where you were on speaker phone.

786
00:54:04.241 --> 00:54:08.070
So how could you even hear it so much here at amplified?
What do you mean?

787
00:54:08.071 --> 00:54:12.960
How could I hear it?
It was amplified.
It sounds like you got really mad.

788
00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:17.420
<v 2>Yeah.
So</v>

789
00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:19.850
<v 3>it sounded like on speaker phone it was so terrible.</v>

790
00:54:19.851 --> 00:54:24.110
I didn't have the stand up to,
to naughty.
I'll tell you,
say it correctly.

791
00:54:24.111 --> 00:54:28.910
You mean stamina,
stamina,
stamina,

792
00:54:29.330 --> 00:54:34.310
fan of that.
The right way to say it.
Stamina,
stamina,
stamina.

793
00:54:34.311 --> 00:54:39.080
Sounds wrong now.
Salmon.
That does sound round.
Yeah.
Fuck Stamina.

794
00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:44.550
Stan [inaudible] Fatima,
you know what you did Dan ma CNA.

795
00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:46.570
It sounds bad when Steven says it.
Yeah.

796
00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:50.890
You did something gross this week to uh,

797
00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:55.930
we were hanging out with the dogs and you were sitting on this chair and the in

798
00:54:56.511 --> 00:54:59.540
our bedroom and you called bitsy over.
Yeah.

799
00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:03.350
And I knew it was coming cause I saw you pose for it.

800
00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:08.400
[inaudible] you farted on Betsey's head but your legs were spread open.

801
00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:13.310
Here's kind of suggest that I sat on,
here's how it was.

802
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:16.680
I was sitting in a chair with my legs open.
Right.

803
00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:20.150
And then she put her paws up like to come up.
Right.
So she's,

804
00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:21.830
she's standing on the ground.

805
00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:27.290
Her paws are on the hair and her face is basically in my open crotch.
Yeah.

806
00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:30.260
And I felt like I was like,
this is going to be a good one,
you know?

807
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:35.720
And what did she do?
She might like,
it was like I was awesome.

808
00:55:35.721 --> 00:55:38.420
Where's that from?
That was great.
Yeah.

809
00:55:38.421 --> 00:55:40.910
Cause bitsy loves the farts and then faith does,

810
00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:43.640
faith doesn't like the smell of fire.
If you fart in your feed,

811
00:55:43.641 --> 00:55:47.230
he gets up and walks away.
Doesn't like farts.
Fevers.

812
00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:50.960
So into self preservation.
He knows like when the baby is going to pull his hair,

813
00:55:50.961 --> 00:55:54.260
he just takes off.
Busy doesn't get it.
Nope.

814
00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:58.490
He didn't even tell exactly what causes that counterpart Bitsy,
uh,

815
00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:04.130
had her beard pulled yesterday by Ellis.
Yeah.
So hard that she cried.

816
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:08.570
Oh,
her ear on her ear.
She hasn't learned yet.

817
00:56:08.571 --> 00:56:12.480
Those Fif sees that baby.
He's like,

818
00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:14.540
I'm out and never going to get my hair pulled.

819
00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.790
So you farted and Betsey's face your face.
Yeah.

820
00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:20.960
And it was neat because I got to witness and I saw the ramp up.

821
00:56:20.961 --> 00:56:24.040
I knew what you're going to do.
Yeah.
And I was like a

822
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:29.040
<v 6>read just totally degraded now and to just being frat boys with each other.</v>

823
00:56:29.531 --> 00:56:33.180
Like do you not want to be romantically associated with?
Absolutely.

824
00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:36.190
Of course I did.
It was just such a good opportunity.

825
00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:39.190
I didn't know how to pass it up.
And you had on boxers too.

826
00:56:39.191 --> 00:56:42.940
So there was only one layer separating bitsy from that fart.

827
00:56:43.090 --> 00:56:47.610
<v 9>And if I could,
if I could explain a little more.
I had a,</v>

828
00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:52.510
a meaty kind of rich lunch and then I came home and I made fitness.

829
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:57.100
Oh.
So they were extra like,
you know,
I dunno.

830
00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:01.990
They were extra cooked up in right there where the system was going.
Yeah.

831
00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:05.920
So I had felt a few like really good ones leading up to the,

832
00:57:05.921 --> 00:57:06.850
I knew it was going to be good.
Yeah.

833
00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:09.260
<v 6>You knew it.
You felt it in your heart?
Yeah.</v>

834
00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:13.760
Now how have your bowel movements been lately?
You haven't,

835
00:57:13.761 --> 00:57:17.900
I heard it this morning.
It didn't sound good.
Did that was,
that one wasn't great.

836
00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:22.370
But aside from that one,
I didn't know you heard that one.
I can always hear,
oh,

837
00:57:22.550 --> 00:57:24.990
that one wasn't good walls for say hearing.

838
00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:31.160
It wasn't very nice.
But aside from that,
it's been really good.

839
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:35.140
Your Diet's been better.
And when is your colonoscopy?

840
00:57:36.330 --> 00:57:39.840
<v 9>It's in a next month.
It's an October.</v>

841
00:57:40.050 --> 00:57:41.370
I think I'm gonna have to have a good day.

842
00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:44.730
I'm traveling on the date it was scheduled.

843
00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:49.550
<v 6>You got to do it,
but it's cleaned up since you've changed your diet a bit.</v>

844
00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:52.850
I know you haven't been eating fried foods or many carbohydrates,

845
00:57:52.851 --> 00:57:57.350
so that's an interesting thing to note and no sugar.
Yeah.
Except yeah,

846
00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:59.890
to this morning it kind of went stop what you think.

847
00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:04.890
Except except for this morning the Brown sounded really explosive.

848
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:06.500
Yeah,
I think

849
00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:11.550
<v 9>it was,
um,
you know,
just like that early morning,
you know,</v>

850
00:58:11.551 --> 00:58:13.380
food made a,
I was on an empty stomach.

851
00:58:13.381 --> 00:58:17.190
When you eat on an empty stomach and it has any richness to it,
you know,

852
00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:18.093
still happen.

853
00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:21.160
<v 6>Yeah.
It was interesting.
I went to silver lake,
uh,</v>

854
00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:26.580
to have lunch with a friend and it was like taking a tour of all the restaurants

855
00:58:26.981 --> 00:58:30.710
from my past and I got diarrhea from.
Yeah.
It's,

856
00:58:30.730 --> 00:58:34.330
it's interesting how many places on the east side.
I,
I used to get diarrhea from.

857
00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:38.320
Where did you end up eating any more?
Good Little Dom's.

858
00:58:39.070 --> 00:58:43.080
It used to be a French place.
Uh,
I can't remember the name of it.
Love who bell?

859
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:47.980
No,
no,
us on what street?
It's on a Hillhurst and you know,
our Mexico City,

860
00:58:47.981 --> 00:58:49.390
that restaurant is,
I've got diarrhea.

861
00:58:49.391 --> 00:58:54.391
There are so many times Mexico City mixed Mexico gives me diarrhea every time I

862
00:58:55.371 --> 00:58:57.820
would.
And I still eat there.
I've got Mama.
You guys,
don't you miss that?

863
00:58:57.850 --> 00:59:00.160
You guys would give me a lot of farts.

864
00:59:00.161 --> 00:59:03.380
But that's my absolute favorite Mexican place and all of Los Angeles.

865
00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:07.390
As you guys in La,
in Los Angeles.
But that is the best.
Yeah.

866
00:59:07.391 --> 00:59:09.470
That is a little stand.
It's a,

867
00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:14.320
it's a stand in a parking lot and a bearded Mexican lady takes your order and

868
00:59:14.321 --> 00:59:18.340
writes it on a bag and you eat in a filthy parking lot.
Yeah.

869
00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:21.920
And like birds take shits next to you and it's the best mood.
She's a big lady.

870
00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:26.330
She's Harry too.
Yeah.
Makes good tacos.
It doesn't really make him,

871
00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:29.630
but she sets out,
she sits down and takes,
or it's her recipes,
I think.
Yeah.

872
00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:33.860
But it was like a tour of everywhere I gotten sick.
Cafe Stella.

873
00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:36.680
I remember we took Maria there years ago.
Yeah.

874
00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:41.090
And she got diarrhea in the bathroom as we were eating their players.

875
00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:45.620
Blair's give me diarrhea.
Really?
They did the collywobbles.

876
00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:50.150
Oh yeah.
I really liked them,
but the,
that made me sick every time.
A lot of risks.

877
00:59:50.450 --> 00:59:54.050
<v 9>Food is just really rich to come with a lot of butter and restaurants.</v>

878
00:59:54.051 --> 00:59:58.250
So can we talk about the why Goo?
Oh my God.
Get your life.

879
00:59:58.410 --> 00:59:59.410
<v 1>Oh my God.</v>

880
01:00:00.990 --> 01:00:05.730
<v 9>I know.
It was really good.
Best thing I've ever had.
Me Too.
It's like buttery.</v>

881
01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:11.840
There's American Wagyu and there's Japanese Wagyu and the Japanese stuff is like

882
01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:14.670
eating a stick of butter.
Yeah.

883
01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:18.720
There they purposely encourage you to get small portion of it

884
01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:23.070
<v 6>cause they know how.
How rich don't need a huge one of that.
Oh my God.</v>

885
01:00:24.050 --> 01:00:26.490
<v 9>Like every bite.
Just</v>

886
01:00:27.630 --> 01:00:32.580
<v 6>how do they get it?
So they do,
they force feed it like Kobe probably like beer,</v>

887
01:00:32.581 --> 01:00:35.280
feed it and massage the calf or whatever.
Is it a cat

888
01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:39.320
<v 9>fatty?
I Dunno.
I don't even know.
It's delicious though.</v>

889
01:00:39.490 --> 01:00:42.400
<v 6>Yeah.
That was real.
A special treat that we,
we,
we went out,</v>

890
01:00:42.401 --> 01:00:45.760
we don't really go out to eat that much anymore.
I used to love to do that.

891
01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:47.620
I said all the time before baby jeans.
Yeah.

892
01:00:48.070 --> 01:00:51.160
But you know the kid sleeps at seven and by then we're just so tired.

893
01:00:51.550 --> 01:00:53.080
All we can do is watch,
you know,

894
01:00:53.081 --> 01:00:57.370
an episode of flipping out on Bravo TV and then I fall asleep by nine.

895
01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:01.940
<v 9>I go to bed even much earlier now.
I went to bed at 11 last night.
Oh Wow.</v>

896
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.340
He used to be up every night one too.

897
01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:09.910
<v 6>No.
And if you left town I'd be like backpack.
No,
five 30.
Ah,</v>

898
01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:16.090
yeah,
you were a real night owl now too tired.
I'm exhausted.

899
01:01:16.091 --> 01:01:18.370
Every damn exhausted to the bone.

900
01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:23.180
You had your beard trimmed.
Hmm.

901
01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:31.860
<v 9>You can see it if you're watching.
It's much shorter.
Um,</v>

902
01:01:31.950 --> 01:01:36.670
and it was cut a week ago.
So you can imagine,
dude,
I,
I had to get it.

903
01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:39.720
So here's the thing,
your beard starts to get really thick.

904
01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:41.940
You don't just throw the trimmer on it,
right?

905
01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:46.380
Because your hair starts to grow on your face.
Like it went on your head.

906
01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:51.770
Meaning that it's better to have a professional trim it because when you're

907
01:01:53.161 --> 01:01:58.161
talking about long bushy hair than it's growing in different directions and

908
01:01:58.201 --> 01:02:01.260
different lengths.
So,
but when you have a pro do it,
you know,

909
01:02:01.261 --> 01:02:02.160
they'll comb it like you,

910
01:02:02.161 --> 01:02:05.550
they would your head and have and shape it like you would your hair.

911
01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:08.100
So my guy is awesome.

912
01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:11.920
He's the best and he's added town last week and it's getting my,

913
01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:16.770
my beard is getting like to a degree of mountain man that I can't even,

914
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:20.220
you know what I mean?
Like it's Farrell,
it's too,
so I go,

915
01:02:20.221 --> 01:02:23.970
can you recommend me somebody?
And he goes,
yeah.
And He sends me this dude,

916
01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:29.880
good guy,
pro guy obviously.
And I just don't give them any,

917
01:02:29.881 --> 01:02:33.210
it's my fault.
I don't give him any heads up.
Like he just goes,
oh,

918
01:02:33.211 --> 01:02:36.630
what's going on?
I go,
oh,
this thing's out of control and a,

919
01:02:36.631 --> 01:02:39.830
I don't want to just throw the clippers on it.
And he's like,
Nah,
you need,

920
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:44.310
you need someone to shape that for you.
I go,
yeah,
he doesn't ask me much more on.

921
01:02:44.311 --> 01:02:44.791
He's like,
all right.

922
01:02:44.791 --> 01:02:47.840
And he starts doing all this stuff that I'm used to this guy doing,
you know,

923
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:51.180
combing it,
clipping it with clippers,
like,
or with scissors,

924
01:02:51.181 --> 01:02:55.230
like you would head hair.
And then I go,
yeah,
down here,
I don't know about,

925
01:02:55.231 --> 01:02:58.980
you know,
pulling it up something.
He goes,
Oh yeah,
you don't want a line.

926
01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:01.110
I just kind of blended in and I go,
okay,

927
01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:05.080
he throws his clippers on like when you hear the one,
I'm like,
yeah.

928
01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:05.973
And then he just goes

929
01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:11.310
and clips it all off and I was like,
uh,

930
01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:15.030
<v 6>and you can see it go down.
Right?
Like,
you know when they're fucking you.
Yeah.</v>

931
01:03:15.070 --> 01:03:19.090
Like you know it's happening,
but you're like hoping against hope.

932
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:21.390
Maybe this guy knows what he's doing yet.

933
01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:25.600
Maybe I should just hang back a little and not panic.
And after like,
um,

934
01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:28.970
<v 9>uh,
something really dramatic,
you know,
you can't go,
oh right.</v>

935
01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:32.380
It's too late to like,
let's just see where it goes.
Yeah.

936
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:37.630
It just keeps going and going.
And I'm like,
oh my God.
And to make it even worse,

937
01:03:37.631 --> 01:03:40.560
I even go like,
Oh wow,
this is really different

938
01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:46.180
<v 6>and what I'm used to.
And he's like,
Oh yeah,
yeah.
It just,</v>

939
01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:49.730
it turns almost the whole thing off and you have to act like you do.
Love it.

940
01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:53.750
Thank you.
Wow.
Yeah.
It goes different,
but it's fun to see different looks.

941
01:03:55.310 --> 01:03:57.290
It is fun.
Well,

942
01:03:57.291 --> 01:04:01.810
you came home and I was like,
well,

943
01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:06.530
it's like when you had those replacement teeth.
Oh my God.

944
01:04:06.531 --> 01:04:10.070
That was the worst dude you got.
Fuck.

945
01:04:10.071 --> 01:04:14.510
Like he fucked your beard so bad.
It's a little better now.
It's way better.

946
01:04:14.511 --> 01:04:17.540
It's grown a week.
Yeah.
I mean your,
your beard grow so fast.

947
01:04:17.541 --> 01:04:21.600
Thankfully that it wasn't too long looking like a dick.
But Dude,

948
01:04:21.610 --> 01:04:26.150
that guy jacked you.
Yeah.
We got to yell at Allen.
Allen sent you there.
No,

949
01:04:26.151 --> 01:04:27.760
we don't need to yell at him though because like I said,

950
01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:31.800
<v 9>I could have,
when he said how's it going or what's going on,</v>

951
01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:36.270
and I was telling him I could have said the normal thing,
which is,
you know,

952
01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:38.520
it's way too big.
I want to bring it down some.

953
01:04:38.650 --> 01:04:42.010
<v 6>Yeah.
This is what you should say to a new person.
He doesn't know me at all.</v>

954
01:04:42.130 --> 01:04:45.530
I should have given him some direct.
Explicit.
Yeah.
I was just like,
yeah,

955
01:04:45.531 --> 01:04:47.590
it's long.
And he just went at it and he was like,

956
01:04:47.591 --> 01:04:52.080
let me let me fuck your shit up.
You want to look stupid?
I was like,

957
01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:55.390
you look stupid.
God,
why stood up?
I was like,
man,

958
01:04:55.391 --> 01:04:58.630
this looks like shit and that doors and then you can't really,

959
01:04:58.631 --> 01:05:01.890
you can't express your sadness cause like you just,

960
01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:05.230
you just know you're never going to go back there.
Yeah,
of course.
It's a loss.

961
01:05:05.231 --> 01:05:06.064
It's a wash.

962
01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:07.650
<v 9>Talk about it.
You're like,
hmm,</v>

963
01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.730
maybe we should just cut the whole thing off right now.

964
01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.490
I considered it for a moment and I was like,

965
01:05:12.491 --> 01:05:17.491
well there's still some there so it's probably better to not trim more.

966
01:05:17.501 --> 01:05:19.390
In other words,
it'll catch up

967
01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:23.010
<v 6>ELAC quicker.
It grows so fast on you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I,
you know,</v>

968
01:05:23.011 --> 01:05:27.180
I went to my regular misuse and uh,
she's like,

969
01:05:27.181 --> 01:05:31.530
do you want to try Reiki?
And I'm like,
yeah,
I asked her,
I go,
does it feel nice?

970
01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:35.940
She goes,
yeah,
some people think,
think it feels nice.
You know,
I wanted a massage.

971
01:05:35.941 --> 01:05:40.500
Really.
I didn't want to try Reiki but,
but I kind of roll with it.
Yeah.
Anyway,

972
01:05:40.530 --> 01:05:45.510
I absolutely hated it cause it's like one of those things where they just touch

973
01:05:45.511 --> 01:05:50.040
you,
they touch your shock rose or whatever the fuck.
And I fell asleep.

974
01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:54.330
I went through phases of sleep,
anger,
rage,

975
01:05:54.690 --> 01:05:57.780
like stop fucking touching me,
like just fucking rubbed me like,
let's go.
Yeah.

976
01:05:58.050 --> 01:06:01.170
And I really like her and you know,
we,

977
01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:02.820
we just decided to try something different,

978
01:06:02.821 --> 01:06:07.410
so I had to pretend like I really enjoyed the Reiki.
Like she goes,

979
01:06:07.411 --> 01:06:11.940
did you love it?
I go,
yeah.
Thank you.
Oh,
I loved it.
Yeah.

980
01:06:11.941 --> 01:06:15.600
What a neat experience is that thing too?
It's like just being right,
right?
Yeah.

981
01:06:15.601 --> 01:06:16.310
Yeah.

982
01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:21.310
<v 9>I had that once in a hotel where I call the spa going to deep tissue and then I</v>

983
01:06:21.501 --> 01:06:24.890
get in the room and it's like this frail older lady and I'm like,

984
01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.820
so you do deep tissue,
Huh?
And she's like,
that's not really what I do.

985
01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:32.390
That's what I booked.
She's like,
wait til you experience what I do.

986
01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:39.120
Like just touching your like tickling.
Yeah.
Gentle touching.
And I was like,
ah,

987
01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:41.510
my seven year old girls do to,
what do you think?

988
01:06:41.570 --> 01:06:43.860
I'm like that I think I like it more fresher.

989
01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:47.940
<v 6>Well,
sure.
Yeah.
Well</v>

990
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:54.410
I know,
and she goes,
uh,
so I see her later.
The reiki lady.

991
01:06:54.411 --> 01:06:56.840
I saw her like a couple of weeks later

992
01:06:58.610 --> 01:07:02.450
and she's like,
so how did you,
how did you feel a

993
01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:07.310
breakthrough?
Did you have any weird dreams?
I was like,
Oh yeah.

994
01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:09.550
<v 9>Oh,
it was so good.</v>

995
01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:14.120
<v 6>So weird.
Thanks.
Hi.
I can't even tell you because she goes,</v>

996
01:07:14.121 --> 01:07:15.850
you're going to have a spiritual enema.
I'm getting,

997
01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:17.780
this is like a spiritual I and I was and I thought,

998
01:07:17.781 --> 01:07:22.430
well that's two things I love.
Yeah.
I like spirituality and I like shinning,
so.

999
01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:24.530
Yep.
I'm on board.
You thought you were ready to go?

1000
01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:27.710
I thought I was in for a treat.
That is your wheel house.
Oh,
I know.
Yeah.

1001
01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:31.000
And then I got,
I got real disappointed.
I got real angry.
Yeah.

1002
01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:35.420
Angry you if you try Reiki.
No,
I don't want to.
I know.
I don't like it.

1003
01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:40.340
Go ballistic.
It's so horrible.
I don't like any of that life.
Oh.

1004
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:45.740
I always like whatever strength you have,
give it to me.
All of it.

1005
01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:49.360
She literally just touched my,
yeah.

1006
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.750
For like 15 minutes and then I'm going to,

1007
01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:57.680
she touched my heart in my chest Chakra.
Just touched it.

1008
01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:02.270
And then I'm going to,
and I was like,
ah,
fuck.
I wanted to river.

1009
01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:04.053
And

1010
01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:08.480
I do like being kicked in the morning.

1011
01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:14.810
I'd rather get kicked in the balls into Reiki again.
Yeah.
Fuck that was

1012
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:19.280
<v 3>and raging.
Yeah.
And it went on for so long.</v>

1013
01:08:19.281 --> 01:08:24.281
It was a full hour of just soft touches that for an hour I Dude,

1014
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:28.700
oh,
that's terrible.
That's terrible.
It's too long.
If I want to take a nap,

1015
01:08:28.701 --> 01:08:32.990
I could have stayed home.
I made a nap.
And your and your table man.

1016
01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:38.030
Shit.
You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?
We have some,

1017
01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:42.090
you know what I'm saying?
Is here,
I think it's,
you knows,
it's Lorens Larkin.

1018
01:08:42.091 --> 01:08:42.924
Let's see,

1019
01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:44.340
<v 13>he's a free agent.</v>

1020
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:48.950
What statement do you think you made tonight with this performance?
Um,
you know,

1021
01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:51.840
I think I made a pretty big statement.
You know,
I'm not even ranked,

1022
01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:56.660
so I couldn't tell you if even if there was ranking from one 15,

1023
01:08:56.700 --> 01:09:01.140
I can tell you where I was at.
So I think it just shows a lot.

1024
01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:05.700
You know,
I took the fight on short notice and,
uh,
you know,
I've,

1025
01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:08.760
I finished them and then in the first round,
you know,
and,
um,

1026
01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:11.660
I don't feel like it was a lucky shot.
And you know,

1027
01:09:11.790 --> 01:09:14.520
I think it was just right from the get go.
You know,

1028
01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:18.070
it's sticking to the game plan,
lot of,
you know,

1029
01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:19.620
where I was out of division,

1030
01:09:20.270 --> 01:09:21.103
<v 3>you know.</v>

1031
01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:25.800
<v 13>Yeah.
You know,
it's not like I don't,
you know,
I see stuff on the,</v>

1032
01:09:25.801 --> 01:09:29.580
on the media and the Internet,
you know,
and comments,
you know,
when,

1033
01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:32.640
when UFC post stuff and bypass was posting stuff.

1034
01:09:32.641 --> 01:09:37.050
And I see the comments of fans like,
you know,
who is this guy?
Who is he?

1035
01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:43.330
<v 3>Um,
and you're a big,
big proponent of separating,
you knows,
you know,</v>

1036
01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:45.660
what I'm saying is you feel me,
I'm talking about,

1037
01:09:46.530 --> 01:09:51.300
so this guy would be in his own,
you know,
category Lorens Larkin.
Let's see,

1038
01:09:51.301 --> 01:09:52.830
a super cut of all his,

1039
01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:58.790
<v 13>um,
you know,
you know,
we know that,
you know,</v>

1040
01:09:59.630 --> 01:10:04.160
you know,
I mean,
you know,
you know,
you know,
and you know,
you know,
I'm not known,

1041
01:10:04.161 --> 01:10:09.100
you know,
and you know,
you know that,
you know,
you know well,
you know,
you know,

1042
01:10:09.530 --> 01:10:13.420
you know.
Yeah.
You know,
when you know,

1043
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:19.340
you know,
uh,
you know,
you know,
but you know what I'm,
you know,

1044
01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:24.440
<v 3>I'm partial to,
you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
I like,
you know,
so,</v>

1045
01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:28.520
but uh,
to me it's really,
it's this,

1046
01:10:28.521 --> 01:10:31.130
the special thing is,
hey,
you know what I'm saying?

1047
01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:35.960
Cause it started that way with us.
We we liked,
you know what I'm saying?

1048
01:10:35.961 --> 01:10:40.660
You know what I'm saying?
Yes.
I'm talking,
you feel me?

1049
01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:41.690
I'm saying

1050
01:10:43.810 --> 01:10:48.410
try fact that you feel me.
You know,

1051
01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:04.460
<v 14>it's</v>

1052
01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:09.410
<v 3>unreal,
man.
I got a good joke for your dad.
Really?
Well,
I told it to you.</v>

1053
01:11:09.411 --> 01:11:13.830
I don't want to,
I just got to write it down for next time.
For Your Dad.

1054
01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:19.440
<v 6>Yeah.
Tell him this one.
Um,
let's see here.</v>

1055
01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:24.060
There's that.
There's,
wait,
can I bring up a dad thing real quick?
Then?
Of course.

1056
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:27.930
Remember,
um,
were you here when my dad,
no,
you weren't here.

1057
01:11:28.230 --> 01:11:31.230
My Dad came to visit with my cousin Julie,

1058
01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:36.780
and he was watching Ellis play on his little thing that he runs in circles on

1059
01:11:36.781 --> 01:11:41.550
this little toy.
Yeah.
And my dad goes,
you know,
uh,

1060
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.990
pretty soon you're going to have to start hitting him.

1061
01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:51.400
I go,
well,
he's like,
well,
yeah.
I mean,
you know it.

1062
01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:55.210
He's going to get a little older and they get a little out of line.

1063
01:11:55.230 --> 01:11:59.370
You sometimes you just got to hit a kid.
That's what they tell you.
It's good.

1064
01:11:59.371 --> 01:12:03.600
He goes,
Doctor Tony Grant used to say this,
you have to hit the kid.

1065
01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:08.670
Why?
I was like,
oh thanks.
I don't even hit,

1066
01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:12.090
I don't hit anybody in my life.
Right.
There's no one getting it up right now.

1067
01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:15.960
The dogs,
I don't hit anybody.
Yeah.
And if,
if,

1068
01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.600
if I'm not hitting you where the dogs and it's working out,

1069
01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:20.990
I think we should hit him.
No,

1070
01:12:21.710 --> 01:12:24.180
this is the one time I'm going to say we shouldn't listen to your dad.

1071
01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:29.790
He's got a great parenting advice,
but did you get hit?
Uh,
yeah.
Yeah.

1072
01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:34.170
Not like now.
I mean,
there you go.
No,

1073
01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:37.950
but he would give me,
he'd spank with my parents were spankers.

1074
01:12:37.951 --> 01:12:40.720
They would hit me with a wooden spoon.
The fuck are now is what they call it.

1075
01:12:40.721 --> 01:12:45.450
Hungarian.
A wooden spoon and spanx.

1076
01:12:45.451 --> 01:12:50.220
Yeah.
My Dad would spank my ass as a kid and he gave me a cookie.

1077
01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:54.420
Did I tell you this one?
When they knocks your head a cookie.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1078
01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:57.150
I really like knock your head.
It's really terrible though.

1079
01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:01.950
I would never do that to a kid.
It's very demeaning.
Speaking of,
uh,

1080
01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:04.530
you know what I'm saying is,
do you remember the song?
You know what I'm saying?

1081
01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.500
Yeah.
I go with crew.
Yeah.
It was really good.

1082
01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:18.040
<v 2>It's so dope.
You don't say
same.</v>

1083
01:13:20.970 --> 01:13:21.803
Right.

1084
01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:26.353
You know what I'm saying?

1085
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:33.790
Mom.
Mom,
mom.

1086
01:13:36.610 --> 01:13:38.540
You don't say yes.

1087
01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:42.750
Same French accent us.
You know what I'm saying?

1088
01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:47.300
Like some mayor of know what I'm saying,

1090
01:14:07.690 --> 01:14:08.523
You

1091
01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:13.220
know what I'm saying about my dog barks?

1092
01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:20.540
Anyone understand that?
That's fraud,

1093
01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:24.790
but it goes crew.
They made that song.

One of my favorites.
Wait,</v>

Nah,

They spent my mom me a few times and like her third time she,

1097

I laughed and she was like,

Yeah.

1098
01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:42.230
That's always the key to getting hit as a kid.
If you start laughing,

1099
01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.390
then the power's gone.
By the way.

1100
01:14:44.391 --> 01:14:46.460
You want to see something amazing that somebody sent in?

1144
01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:42.850

1152
01:19:06.581 --> 01:19:09.660
You couldn't call someone a faggot it even if they stole something.
Yeah.

1153
01:19:09.810 --> 01:19:12.370
Well there are,
they don't have to treat them with dignity.
Like,

If it's a thief,

Some real pain.
It sounds like

1162
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:04.770
I'm a poor guy.

1163
01:20:09.930 --> 01:20:13.130
Oh my God.
Yes.
It's offensive.

1164
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:18.050
So what happened?
But these must be,

1165

he drove into something like the site and that's what this he and he took it

1167
01:20:23.531 --> 01:20:27.040
with them in other words.
Right.
With the,
with the power of the motor.
Yup.

1168
01:20:27.190 --> 01:20:30.780
And that's what Ben has let Jesus,

Hmm.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.870
Anyways,

Um,

1170
01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:40.240
Yeah.
That's really good.
Plus I lived the other dudes talking shit to him.
Yeah.

1171
01:20:40.241 --> 01:20:44.170
That's kind of my favorite part.
It was pretty good.
Yeah.
I enjoyed that.

1172
01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:47.260
Like,
come on Faggot.
Hold it together.

1173
01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:50.530
This master of accidents came in with a translation.
You want to try it?

1174
01:20:50.590 --> 01:20:54.310
It's actually,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Familiar.
We've seen it before,

1175
01:20:54.910 --> 01:20:58.240
but we didn't play it as a master of accidents.
We just played it.
Um,

1176
01:20:58.241 --> 01:20:59.520
I'll show you,
you'll recognize.

1177

<v 2>Oh yeah,

1178
01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:26.610
Do you want to shine on TV yet?

01:21:30.690 --> 01:21:33.830
<v 3>Let's say you want,

Yeah.

1182
01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:48.130
So you're just shit out.
That's what it says here.
You're just shit out.

1183
01:21:48.670 --> 01:21:49.930
<v 2>You've got no fans</v>

1184
01:21:58.690 --> 01:22:03.440
<v 3>that I don't know what you don't know.
Durant.
Yeah.
You don't know Duran Duran?
Oh,</v>

1185

I think so.
Yeah.
Simon,

1186
01:22:08.601 --> 01:22:11.360
my favorite singer.
Yeah,
that's what he's talking about.
Yeah.

1187
01:22:11.370 --> 01:22:14.480
You think you're good?
You guys have fans,
but no one here knows what Duran Duran.

1188
01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:18.860
Hey God,
no fun.
Rio is my favorite song.

1189
01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:21.883
<v 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1190
01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:28.780
<v 3>That guy says the fucking hawks are playing well and then the guy goes,</v>

1191
01:22:28.781 --> 01:22:30.590
he wants them.
Yeah.
Awesome.

1192
01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:34.973
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1193
01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:40.930
<v 3>you want to sell?
So he said,
uh,
well the hawks are playing well,</v>

1194
01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:42.160
which I definitely did that get,

1195
01:22:42.410 --> 01:22:43.690
<v 2>oh sure.</v>

1196
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:46.130
<v 3>It was great.
I don't know what the fuck he say.</v>

1197
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:54.630
<v 2>What do you
give it?</v>

1198
01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:57.633
Yeah,

1199
01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:05.330
<v 3>they're winkers little.
Yeah,
I got that.
I got that wasn't,</v>

1200
01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:11.130
but there was a little bit of of a nonsense.
They're drunk.

1201
01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:14.710
Jibberish drunk,
he's kind of a t two a little,
a little drunk.

1202
01:23:14.770 --> 01:23:19.650
Aggressive man is the best.
So cute,
cute little guy in a fight.

1203
01:23:19.830 --> 01:23:23.770
And I was like,
aw.
Like even that guy is being a little like,
oh,
that's cute.

1204
01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:27.400
Little drunken English look drunk.

1205
01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:32.160
Four adorable outcome.
Um,

1206
01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:37.960
I was thinking about maybe a new uh,
exercise program.
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1207
01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:40.120
let's see it.
It's called Mama clean.

1208
01:23:40.930 --> 01:23:44.950
<v 7>I've tried over a thousand ways to make my life manageable and quite frankly,</v>

1209
01:23:45.730 --> 01:23:48.790
I maxed out exercise to me has always been a priority,

1210
01:23:48.791 --> 01:23:51.100
but it was always at the expensive of dirty,

1211
01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:55.330
gooey kitchen or hundreds of Aaron's left undone.
And I finally,

1212
01:23:55.390 --> 01:24:00.390
I got so fed up that I worked out a quirky slightly off the wall that'll system

1213
01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:04.990
where I can get it all done at once.

1214
01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:09.730
<v 3>Okay.
She does like homemade.</v>

1215
01:24:10.410 --> 01:24:14.610
<v 7>The Clean Mamak program is an element of three days.</v>

1216
01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:16.200
Kind of like a triangle.

1217
01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:21.480
On one side of the triangle you're going to have your multitasking exercises

1218
01:24:21.510 --> 01:24:22.500
that I'm going to show you.

1219
01:24:22.501 --> 01:24:26.340
And how to really maximize on the other side of the triangle.

1220
01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:27.390
You're going to have your diet.

1221
01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:30.150
Now don't confuse the word diet with something short term.

1222
01:24:30.450 --> 01:24:32.440
<v 3>You get the idea of what she does,
right and then,</v>

1223
01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:34.960
and then it's like workout while you're cleaning stuff

1224
01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:40.160
<v 7>a,
which I suggest you do at least three times a week.</v>

1225
01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:45.340
It's creating your own personal boot camp style and just really knock it out.

1226
01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:48.370
<v 3>I know she's a real go getter.
These poor women,</v>

1227
01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:53.140
this is the best she with her camera thinks this is a really great opportunity.

1228
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:58.350
So he's a construction worker working outside and approaches him about lifestyle

1229
01:24:59.201 --> 01:25:00.034
changes.
You know

1230
01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:01.470
<v 7>the second way</v>

1231
01:25:06.710 --> 01:25:07.530
<v 16>got to come on.</v>

1232
01:25:07.530 --> 01:25:12.530
[inaudible]

1233
01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:24.730
<v 3>no,
that's the wrong clip.
That's the wrong clip.</v>

1234
01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:31.210
<v 7>Take a look at what I gathered from around my house.</v>

1235
01:25:32.190 --> 01:25:33.420
<v 3>I clip is not the one</v>

1236
01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:40.150
like how much smaller my tits were bad.
Here we go.
Look,
how much

1237
01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:43.050
<v 16>do you ever have time to go to the gym?</v>

1238
01:25:55.280 --> 01:26:00.250
Is your time while you are doing your daily routine,

1239
01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:03.820
what do you do?
Breaking.

1240
01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:09.020
So I'm going to show you how to rake so that you could really get a good ab

1241
01:26:09.021 --> 01:26:11.630
workout in.
You want to learn?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Likes that.

1242
01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:14.720
<v 3>There's a part of this guy that definitely thinks there's,
um,</v>

1243
01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:18.490
he's gonna get it later.
Yes.
That's the only reason he's honking or say what?

1244
01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:22.900
Yeah.
I liked the task of size.
Whatever she says.
He's like,
yeah,
I love it.

1245
01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:25.810
I think he went to the same beard trimmer.
You did.

1246
01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:29.990
<v 16>All right.
I need somebody to hold the camera though.</v>

1247
01:26:30.690 --> 01:26:32.200
<v 3>Can I hold your pussy?
Yeah.</v>

1248
01:26:33.810 --> 01:26:38.350
<v 16>He just wants to here,
take the rake over here.
Here we go.</v>

1249
01:26:39.850 --> 01:26:42.940
Now rake some leaves or whatever.

1250
01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:47.080
And really use your stomach to pull it in.
Use Your Tummy.

1251
01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:50.080
Tuck a cigarette while you do it.

1252
01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:51.193
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1253
01:26:53.630 --> 01:26:55.410
<v 16>The littering is not what we promote.</v>

1254
01:26:57.770 --> 01:26:59.270
<v 3>God doesn't give a fuck.</v>

1255
01:27:01.050 --> 01:27:03.000
<v 16>Okay.
Right.
Do your ranking.</v>

1256
01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:06.190
<v 3>Great video quality.</v>

1257
01:27:06.191 --> 01:27:10.250
Sound great to ask the guy who rakes to [inaudible].

1258
01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:13.800
<v 16>Well,
I didn't gate and use your stomach.
Depaul</v>

1259
01:27:16.810 --> 01:27:18.710
feel a difference.
Yeah.

1260
01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:23.360
<v 3>Yeah.
Oh,
see that?
He's like,</v>

1261
01:27:23.361 --> 01:27:26.360
this is what I do.
She's like,
do it.
Do you feel a difference?
Yeah,

1262
01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:28.650
<v 2>no.</v>

1263
01:27:28.650 --> 01:27:30.670
<v 16>What I want you to do is hold this DVD.
Yep.</v>

1264
01:27:31.550 --> 01:27:32.383
<v 2>Oh my God.</v>

1265
01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:36.370
<v 16>Turn it around and say,
Hey,
mama rock.</v>

1266
01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:38.710
<v 3>Yeah.
Can you suck my Dick?
Yeah.</v>

1267
01:27:41.970 --> 01:27:45.090
Why don't you approach the guy that looks like he already works out?

1268
01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:49.770
Maybe like not that guy.
That guy doesn't want his abs touched at all.

1269
01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:53.400
Oh my God.
He totally thought he was going to get with her.

1270
01:27:53.490 --> 01:27:56.370
That's the only reason those dudes talk to you.
Feel.

1271
01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:01.080
Get my balls kicked right now.
Oh,
I can help you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'd love that.

1272
01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:03.580
I'd love to kick some balls.
Yeah.

1273
01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:10.070
That's why I'm staying nice and hard balls right in the bottom up.

1274
01:28:10.090 --> 01:28:13.150
The files that you know,
be good at that as Maria.
Thanks.

1275
01:28:13.170 --> 01:28:17.010
So she would really sell it.
Yeah,
I think so.

1276
01:28:17.730 --> 01:28:22.320
It's pretty good idea.
Um,
all right,
James,
you got anything else?

1277
01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:25.750
Nope,

1284
01:28:51.391 --> 01:28:52.224
jokes.

1285
01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:54.290
<v 18>Okay.</v>

1286
01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:57.450
<v 3>How can you tell when a blonde sends you a fax?</v>

1287
01:28:57.750 --> 01:29:00.210
<v 18>Ah,
I love blonde jokes,
by the way.</v>

1288
01:29:01.710 --> 01:29:04.080
<v 9>I don't know.
It has a stamp on it.</v>

1289
01:29:05.850 --> 01:29:06.683
<v 14>Love it.</v>

1290
01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:14.973
Love it.

1291
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:20.833
Love it.

1292
01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:26.533
Love it.

1293
01:29:31.530 --> 01:29:32.363
Love it.

1294
01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:36.480
<v 9>Okay.
How can you tell if a blonde has been using your computer?</v>

1295
01:29:38.050 --> 01:29:38.750
<v 14>Okay.</v>

1296
01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:41.310
<v 9>I don't know.
There's whiteout all over the Monitor.</v>

1297
01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:02.143
<v 14>Yeah.</v>

1298
01:30:08.190 --> 01:30:09.760
<v 9>Why do blondes wear panties?</v>

1299
01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:12.353
<v 14>Okay.</v>

1300
01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:14.650
<v 9>I have no idea.
They keep their ankles warm.</v>

1301
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:47.170
What did the blonde say when she saw the sign in front of the Ymcas?

1302
01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:50.900
I don't know.
Look,
they spelled Macy's wrong.

1303
01:31:08.710 --> 01:31:12.860
This is one of the best conversations on my life.
I love just laughing,
Tommy.

1304
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:13.840
