uh,
my flap wagons before I had a kid.

29
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.930
I think you tolerate them now because they're the only set that you get to
touch.

30
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.620
I know.
I'm out there on the road.
I'm doing stuff.
I'm busy.

31
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.420
The only set I'm touching.
You think I'm sticking to one set of purples?
Yeah.
No,

32
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.130
I hope so.
No.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.920

Yeah.
Let's party.
Got Sex.

43
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.000
And when you open someone mode,

44
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.700
<v 4>he used to make you shit in his mouth like that.</v>

45
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.100
I've never had done that before.
And this isn't an experience for a man.

46
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.880
Then he asked him to shit in his mouth then.

47
00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:05.824
So,

48
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.280
<v 3>ah,
man,
Huh.</v>

49
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.240
<v 1>Don't bring in one mothering to this,</v>

50
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.033
Christina.

51
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.973
Oh,

52
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.830
<v 3>that was big
barbells.</v>

53
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.940
These are a Pilipino ladies.
Yeah.
Um,

54
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.020
I don't know if they're a Pilipino or if they are all at the same kind of Latin

55
00:05:18.721 --> 00:05:21.330
to me.
It didn't seem to like,
oh,
I heard Pilipino.
I thought,

56
00:05:21.331 --> 00:05:25.560
wouldn't it be funny if they're talking about my dad?
Oh,
he's named me Sa,

57
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.690
but Jetski yeah.
Now they're talking about a really,
uh,
a famous guy.
Um,

58
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.270
no kidding.
Yeah.
His name.
I have it here in that cheat sheet somewhere.
Hold on.

59
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.770
This guy,
the Cathy,
is that McAfee?
It says that in the title.
Yeah,

60
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.600
the clip macafee shit.
What's he known for?
He was known for,
he's the,

61
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.880
uh,
the McAfee antivirus.
Right.
I thought so.
I've heard the name.

62
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.830
So if you,
um,

63
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.620
I'm sure you've seen if you've used the computer anytime in the last,
uh,

64
00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.841
<v 6>a PC,</v>

65
00:05:58.841 --> 00:06:03.841
I used to have this on my old computer before I had an apple like logo look like

66
00:06:03.911 --> 00:06:05.570
McKesson.
Yeah.
It's familiar,
right?

67
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.760
<v 5>Yeah.
He had a branded virus,
right.
Antivirus thing.</v>

68
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.250
<v 6>Hey mine.
Is My mic super hot?
Yeah.
Can you turn it down?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's better.</v>

69
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.330
Yeah,
there we go.
That's much better.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Everyone's seen the,
um,
the images.

70
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:21.900
Right.
And he'd

71
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.130
open his mouth and do it and they make a messy brown.

72
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.410
I'm the human beat day.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

73
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.260
<v 5>So apparently he's a,
he's a,
yeah,
he's a scat guy.
He's that guy.
Yeah.
He likes,</v>

74
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.010
he likes a puppy in his mouth.
I like the book

75
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.970
<v 6>mouth.
Wow.
Through a hammock.
I didn't,
I missed that.</v>

76
00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:48.830
I was so maybe that,
that part.
I,
uh,
I got a head.
These poor women.

77
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:53.240
How,
how much in a hard way do you have to be for that to be your,

78
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.510
he did this in Belize actually.
I don't know.
I would shit,

79
00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.400
I would shit in somebody's mouth.
That's not that big of a deal.
So nasty.

80
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.190
It's nasty,
but it's not that crazy.

81
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.210
For the first time I was a famous,
then I got used to say she loves it.

82
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.990
You do sit down this hallmark hallmark,

83
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.800
they have market as a whole,

84
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.490
a hallmark and after that he lays on the hammock.

85
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.880
Then he,
you know,

86
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.000
he would cut a little hole and he would sit there.

87
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.740
That's why he used it for,
cause he,

88
00:07:31.741 --> 00:07:36.741
he wanted to have Scott sick fan and then I didn't agree with that.

89
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.550
Yeah.
Scott sex.
So let me get this straight.

90
00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:45.510
How long do you think it took him to come up with the hammock system?
How many,

91
00:07:45.511 --> 00:07:46.850
how much trial and error?

92
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.690
<v 5>Oh,
there's a little bit of it for sure.
For he's like,
wait a minute.</v>

93
00:07:50.691 --> 00:07:54.610
You got to get a Hammock,
you got to cut a hole.
This big.
The hammock isn't,

94
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.430
isn't genius.
And a number of ways.
First of all,
who doesn't like it makes the,

95
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.900
the user comfortable.
He's like,
Oh,
you know,

96
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.860
so why is there the whole in the hammock then your,

97
00:08:03.861 --> 00:08:06.220
your body does something on a hammock is the,

98
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:11.260
in that it's naturally designed to poop better because of the hanging interest.

99
00:08:11.971 --> 00:08:15.330
Saburn your body weight is pulled down more.
Wow.
Right.

100
00:08:15.331 --> 00:08:19.570
So that's exactly kind of the ideal way to shit your body weight.

101
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:23.700
<v 6>Well,
let me think.
Hold on.
Let me think.
Maybe.
And I think too,</v>

102
00:08:23.701 --> 00:08:27.540
if the hammock is just low enough that your feet touch the ground and it pushes

103
00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:32.541
your knees kind of up towards you mouth and God damn it.

104
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.560
And this is Belize.
So these are third world dumps.
These chicks are taking.

105
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:42.360
This is not,
uh,
you know,
you're saying after the steakhouse at Fleming.
Yeah.

106
00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:47.260
<v 5>You're not Swiss dumps,
right?
That's the distinction you're making.</v>

107
00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:50.250
That if it was down ice first world country,
right,

108
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.030
this would be a flavorful thing to do.
Less

109
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:56.130
<v 6>bacteria.
What has got,
and when you,</v>

110
00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:01.080
<v 4>when someone moves and he used to make you shit in his mouth like that,</v>

111
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:05.940
she had a sense of humor about it.
She's not,
say Trump done that before.

112
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:08.760
And it was an experience for me and

113
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.030
he asked him to shit in his mouth.
So

114
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.580
yeah.
One of these girls are scarred regular intercourse.

115
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:25.680
Vaginal intercourse.
Not Easy Gig.
Not Up that easy.
It was the only thing I did

116
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.810
<v 6>talk about an easy gig now that I think about it,
you know,</v>

117
00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:33.990
same with these guys who liked getting kicked in the nuts.
Uh,

118
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:37.890
these guys who like getting farted in the mouth,
shitting in the mouth,

119
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.700
super easy money.
Absolutely nothing.

120
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:47.750
His mouth right depends on one

121
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:51.523
book

122
00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.760
and there's such nice girls there.

123
00:09:58.761 --> 00:10:03.761
So like sweet little beggar who's really smiling.

124
00:10:04.141 --> 00:10:07.410
She's like,
I think sheets every day and now someone wants to eat it.

125
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:12.570
Denies this experience.
He's Arabic spirit of space and experience.
Yeah,
I guess.

126
00:10:12.571 --> 00:10:15.660
I mean if somebody wanted to hire you to do that,
I don't,
I don't know.

127
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.860
How much do you think she'd they get for that?
I Dunno,
he's in Belize.

128
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:24.210
I'm sure he was just like,
do you want a hundred bucks?
A hundred bucks?
Yeah.

129
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.000
I think that's too much for beliefs.
No,

130
00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:30.120
I think the reason he would do that is that so it's undeniable cause it's 100

131
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:34.030
bucks is nothing to him.
So yeah,
he probably would be like,
you know,

132
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.530
don't worry about it.
Just keep coming.
Keep coming over here and shit over here.

133
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.960
He should have also said don't talk about it.
Yeah.

134
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:45.950
These chicks did a documentary on him.
Let's see.
That's such a,

135
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:51.090
so wait a minute.
So they poop in his mouth.
That can't be good for you.

136
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.150
Yeah.
How do you not get sick from that?
Good question.

137
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:58.350
You want to see what he looks like?
Absolutely.
Can I guess wait before you do it.

138
00:10:58.351 --> 00:11:00.150
Yeah.
Okay.
Here's my guests.

139
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.620
Obviously a white guy.
You got that?

140
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:09.700
I'm going to go fifties I'm going to go reddish brown hair.

141
00:11:10.621 --> 00:11:12.060
Kind of like the stapler.

142
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.840
Swingline stapler guy in office space.

143
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:22.200
Reddish Brown hair and disgusting facial hair.
Okay.
Okay,

144
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:23.860
go ahead.
Oh

145
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:32.130
Wow.
Well he's not out of shape.
I imagine him out of shape.

146
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.000
He's got problems than beliefs for sure.

147
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.290
This guy doesn't look like not the guy who wants to get his mouth shut and you

148
00:11:40.291 --> 00:11:45.180
don't know.
He looks like the guy who likes to get his mouth fuck can,
hey man,

149
00:11:45.181 --> 00:11:45.630
shit,

150
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:50.190
this guy takes the loaves loafs in his mouth and let's see you smile too.

151
00:11:50.191 --> 00:11:53.980
He's like,
that's,
that's him.
When he meets you looking at you,

152
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.500
<v 3>if you're a woman.
And he's like,
imagine that dump in his mouth.</v>

153
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:02.020
I wonder what the fs,
I actually understand after our show,

154
00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:04.540
I think our show helped me understand the fart fetish more.

155
00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.800
We met people that were there and I started understand,
oh,

156
00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:09.910
especially when they're like,

157
00:12:09.911 --> 00:12:14.740
I like the idea of the pretty beautiful woman with the dirty smell and you're

158
00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:17.530
like,
okay,
I get it.
There's a taboo.
They totally get it.

159
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.580
Shit in your mouth is such another level for me.
I mean,
it's,
well,

160
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:26.470
it's so disgusting.
It's not even discussing on a subjective level.
You know,

161
00:12:26.471 --> 00:12:29.260
it's,
it's such a health hazard.
You know,
it's uh,

162
00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:33.510
it's something that can make you so unbelievably sick.
It's so,
God damn,

163
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.650
I just don't understand what the fuck the,
the allure is.

164
00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:44.500
Jeez,
look at this one.
It looks like,
see this was after he ate a bad shit.

165
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:49.420
This is hepatitis is not,
I have to take a bad shit.
This is,

166
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:53.320
I ate someone shit
here

167
00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:59.890
for Dui and gun possession.
The thing is,
Ooh,
this guy's crazy.

168
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.190
If you're Gunna let some chicks shit in your mouth,

169
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:07.480
do it in the first world because listen to you like that makes a difference.

170
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:12.100
There's hepatitis.
Of course.
It doesn't make Brent worms.
Ringworm.

171
00:13:12.101 --> 00:13:15.200
I don't know what I'm saying.
Absolutely.
You're so far off on this.

172
00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:20.350
I'm just kidding.
I don't know.
Let's see.
Let's see what he's worth.

173
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:24.580
Oh my God.
He must be worth a lot that every 100 million.

174
00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.960
That's when you go to Belize and get girls to shit in your mouth because life is

175
00:13:28.961 --> 00:13:32.570
no longer exciting for you.
It looks like.
Uh,
what?

176
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:36.610
What else can you do with your life?
His board,

177
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.720
his believes compound where he lived before he snuck out of the country to avoid

178
00:13:40.721 --> 00:13:45.490
talking to police about a murder boy was burned to the ground.
Oh Wow.
Wow.

179
00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:48.200
This guy's scandalous.
Yeah,
so he's walking around.

180
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:52.120
These poor girls are probably just village road.
Hey,
come here.

181
00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:57.220
Then we got some shit.
He drive through the village.

182
00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:02.260
Who's got to take it down?
Maybe he goes to Starbucks there.

183
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.820
It says he lived with a Harem of young women and would doesn't some of which you

184
00:14:06.821 --> 00:14:10.680
said were presented to him as 16 year old prostitute.
Yeah.

185
00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.990
Not The coolest guy that we've talked to.
Beating them fiber.
Yeah.

186
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.630
You got shit yet.
I'm tech Shit.
So we should catch people up.

187
00:14:19.631 --> 00:14:24.400
Obviously last week I was here and I was telling you that I hope I,

188
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:30.770
I would be having a still have a beard and I do because you are the weight loss

189
00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:35.480
champ.
I am the weight loss champion of the entire world.
Congratulations.

190
00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:39.550
Thank you very much.
That was a victory well deserved.
And it really,

191
00:14:39.551 --> 00:14:42.190
both of you are winners at the end of the day,
right?
Uh,
we are,

192
00:14:42.191 --> 00:14:47.050
we are both winners.
The bigger winner,
a better winter.
Um,

193
00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.390
and uh,
La last week,
Monday,

194
00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:53.660
it was tough episode to get through cause I was in the middle of that weight
cut.

195
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:58.420
I remember I was staring at water.
I was like,
ah,
brutal.

196
00:14:58.421 --> 00:14:59.254
Weight cutting is brutal.

197
00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:03.260
It's so hard for you to refrain from drinking water because you don't normally

198
00:15:03.261 --> 00:15:05.540
drink that much anyways.
You know it's funny,

199
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.450
Jeff Tate said it best when it was my water consumption.
He goes,

200
00:15:08.451 --> 00:15:12.680
you're not just winning the water,
drinking battles.

201
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:15.380
You're running up the score.
And I was like,

202
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:19.460
what a what an appropriate thing to say to offer.

203
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.880
Jeff takes some feature weeks,
but I'm not going to anymore.

204
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.520
I'm sure he's deeply offended.
Dumb Shit like that.
Yeah.

205
00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.310
Do you think he wants to feature for you?
Maybe he does.
I don't think so.
Why not?

206
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.610
Probably because he's above that.
Yeah,
I know,

207
00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:38.540
but I've got a better personality than you and I feel like he'd want to hang out

208
00:15:38.541 --> 00:15:41.120
with me more.
This is the dumbest thing you've said yet,

209
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.910
and this one's going to hurt your feelings because you brought this up last

210
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.080
night.
I don't know why you brought it up,

211
00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:49.400
but you were trying to talk about which of us has a better personality or weight

212
00:15:49.401 --> 00:15:51.900
loss too.
I don't want to be a little that.
Yeah,
well,

213
00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:54.320
I was talking about that last night.
I don't know how it came up,

214
00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:55.550
but I thought to myself,

215
00:15:56.090 --> 00:16:01.070
it's obvious that I have a better personality than you and it must be hard

216
00:16:01.071 --> 00:16:02.900
being,
you know.
Um,

217
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:07.280
and I know I couldn't tell if you were joking or what was going on and I'm not

218
00:16:07.281 --> 00:16:11.710
joking.
I'm serious.
I have such a better personality than you are early.

219
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:16.230
This one is so silly.
It's so silly.
I mean,
I,

220
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.550
I can take into account some of the jokes,
you know,

221
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:24.260
even though it's clearly night and day with this water stuff that I'm a Bayer

222
00:16:24.261 --> 00:16:29.030
consumer,
when it comes to personality,
chances are much better than you.

223
00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.960
Not even one person that knows the two of us.
First of all,

224
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:38.750
an example.
Anybody that no two of us is around you.
Like,

225
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.770
you know,
like,
oh,
like people,
people love me.
They know they don't love you.

226
00:16:42.771 --> 00:16:47.390
Nobody loves the way people like me.
That's not true.
Much more than,

227
00:16:47.391 --> 00:16:52.140
you know.
Nobody feels that way.
People tolerate you.

228
00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:56.810
That's true.
People are okay with you being around.

229
00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.910
I'm celebrating.
It's totally different.
I know,

230
00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:08.330
I know you are more popular than me.
Uh,
you're definitely famous,
like,

231
00:17:08.331 --> 00:17:10.950
you know what I mean?
You're famous or more famous.

232
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:15.350
That's not what I'm talking about in our private life.
It's me 10 to one.

233
00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:20.430
First of all,
your family like me way more than they like it.

234
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:24.410
It's so obvious.
Your dad talks to me all the time.
He enjoys my company.

235
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:26.840
Your mother likes,
he likes those mushy purples.

236
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.510
It's only the only talking to you when we're in green rooms.
This is you.

237
00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.850
Wait,
when are we in green?
In green rooms together.

238
00:17:35.851 --> 00:17:39.790
If we happen to work a weekend together,
you'll be on your phone the whole time.

239
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.750
The last time that

240
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.160
that's okay.
First of all,
you're talking about a work.

241
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:53.010
It's a totally different thing.
But yeah,
if you'd go to all the,

242
00:17:53.011 --> 00:17:56.190
any comedy club and you go like,
yeah,
but like,
who's your favorite?

243
00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:00.150
I'm on their list for sure.
Who is your favorite comic or no?
Favorite person?

244
00:18:00.151 --> 00:18:03.480
Person,
person.
Everybody likes me more.
No,

245
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:07.500
no one would have you on their list if you,
if you talk about like,
oh,

246
00:18:07.501 --> 00:18:11.970
the valet,
the guy that you know,
the,
the host,
uh,
at the,

247
00:18:11.971 --> 00:18:15.630
at the restaurant that greets you and you're,
and it's like,
Hey,

248
00:18:15.631 --> 00:18:18.510
you met that couple that they would all be like,
that guy was great.

249
00:18:18.511 --> 00:18:22.320
He was so much fun.
He brought,
he just brought a certain level.

250
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:26.790
He had such a dynamic personality and he was so fun just to have a,

251
00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:31.500
he was charming.
He should ask our friends and then they would say like,

252
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:35.880
oh,
he brought that dud with him.
But uh,
but I guess,
you know,
I dunno,
he's,

253
00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:40.440
maybe he's doing a favor.
I think we should ask the people in our lives,

254
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.790
you're going to get your feelings hurt.
Horribly.
Vote for who they like,

255
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.320
like who's got a,
and I'm not saying that they like more,

256
00:18:46.321 --> 00:18:49.230
but who's got a better personality?
And I just,

257
00:18:49.231 --> 00:18:54.030
I think in my heart that you really,
really think that my personality,

258
00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:57.060
like I'm just more fun.
You're not more fun,

259
00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:03.210
so much more,
much colder.
You're much older,
much.

260
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.840
I have two dogs that I lavish with.
Love that you're one of those models.

261
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:11.040
When those people was like,
I'm not good with people.

262
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.890
I like the animals and which is fine.
It's fine.

263
00:19:13.891 --> 00:19:16.290
I think the animals appreciate it.
They need you.

264
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.860
Human beings feel like you're cold.

265
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:26.490
Absolutely.
Much,
much more kind of a downtrodden whether personality.

266
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.830
Definitely.
You said last night you're like,
you're,
you're more like solen.

267
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:37.200
Yes,
I am in I am,
but not all the time.
No,

268
00:19:37.201 --> 00:19:40.330
but most of the time.
Yeah.
Like I would say that I have,

269
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:44.890
I'm definitely a dark sided.
I'm,
I'm more of the dark side.
The dark side.
Yeah.

270
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.620
I'm not,
I'm not like a,
you know,
Bimbo free.
Hey,

271
00:19:49.621 --> 00:19:54.270
we're talking about like all the time.
Yeah.
And I know I'm definitely dark,

272
00:19:54.271 --> 00:19:58.230
but I also,
I think that my personal,
I'm friendly,
I'm friendlier to people.

273
00:19:58.231 --> 00:20:02.340
I'm just more dynamic than,
you know,
I'm more,

274
00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:04.620
I already know what's going to happen.
By the way,

275
00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.260
on these emails we're going to get bombarded with like,

276
00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.180
it's going to be all chicks that go.

277
00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:14.450
I just want to say I saw that episode and I love seeing that you're definitely

278
00:20:14.641 --> 00:20:16.830
my favorite and they'll talk about how to love you,

279
00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:20.610
but just know they're doing that the way someone does to like a kid who got left

280
00:20:20.611 --> 00:20:23.580
out and I didn't get picked on the team.
So everybody's like,

281
00:20:23.581 --> 00:20:25.920
oh we're playing ball and one kid standing on the sideline like,

282
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.980
oh wish I could play.
And then a lady comes over and puts her arm around him.

283
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:29.880
That's what's going to happen.

284
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.510
So they're going to get a bunch of shit to tell you that you're the fucking

285
00:20:33.511 --> 00:20:36.960
winning person.
The personality champion.
I'm also the water champion.

286
00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.550
You might be the weight loss champion,

287
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.580
but I'm the personality champ and the water,

288
00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.190
it's been open for a long time.

289
00:20:44.191 --> 00:20:48.070
You're just holds my fourth one of the fucking lie.
First of all,

290
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.560
<v 6>the filtration system and our house isn't working.</v>

291
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:55.000
Who demanded that we pull over and get water before you show me you didn't even

292
00:20:55.001 --> 00:20:59.110
notice that shit cause you don't care.
I drink gallons of water a day.

293
00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:02.200
<v 5>What is wrong with you?
God,</v>

294
00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:05.780
<v 6>it's not a battle anymore.
It's just in the past now,
man,</v>

295
00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.280
I'm the personality champ

296
00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:13.850
as the personality champion because my personality is just more loving and kind

297
00:21:13.851 --> 00:21:17.000
and giving.
I like to discuss your weight loss some more.

298
00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:20.540
Everybody wants to know how are you feeling?
How would you do it?

299
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:24.590
Just like afterglow because you have so much good reason to,
a

300
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:29.020
<v 5>glow from us.
You are right.
I do.
And um,</v>

301
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:34.020
I also thought about that.
I would do at some point,
I think I'm going to do,
uh,

302
00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:36.610
a an episode of your mom's house,

303
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.200
like an extra episode just dedicated to weight loss.
That's a great idea.

304
00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.710
Just talk all about everything.

305
00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:45.480
I'll give you the quick summary of Le just so people know all about the wage and

306
00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:49.420
everything.
You know,
we touched on it.
I don't know if you watched Joe Rogan,
uh,

307
00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.180
last week,
uh,
on Monday and Tuesday,

308
00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:57.520
Bert Kreischer and I went in and spent two full days,
uh,
where we were.

309
00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:58.990
We had a weight loss bet going.

310
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.820
Here's people because a few people have misinterpreted the bet just so they know

311
00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.210
what the vet was.
Cause I've even seen some people go,
well technically,
no,
no,
no,

312
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:12.360
you don't know what the wager was.
The wager was this,
it was not a,

313
00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.350
a percentage of body weight.

314
00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:19.620
It was not who started way or an ended up where it was a straight up who weighs

315
00:22:21.071 --> 00:22:25.300
less by the date.
That's it.
So if everybody's like,

316
00:22:25.301 --> 00:22:29.180
well what if the BMI or what if the,
we had a hit,

317
00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:33.970
he and I had a straight up who could lose more weight bet.

318
00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.240
Okay.
That's first.
Secondly,

319
00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:42.610
as far as the starting weights,
when the bet was sealed,
like it was on,

320
00:22:42.611 --> 00:22:45.820
the handshake was made over the phone.

321
00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:50.290
He claimed to be to 40 and then I said I was two 42.

322
00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:55.660
And where are you lying?
I was between when you started.
When we started our bet.

323
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:59.680
Okay.
And when was this?
What month?
It was November,
early November.
Oh Wow.
See,

324
00:22:59.681 --> 00:23:02.830
I started losing weight in August.
He,
uh,
and he,

325
00:23:02.831 --> 00:23:06.340
he said he was two 40 when we started the vet a week afterwards.

326
00:23:06.341 --> 00:23:11.320
He told me he was two 50.
Okay.
Meaning he's weighs more than what he claimed.

327
00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.370
I,

328
00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:17.370
when I said I was two 42 I was maybe two 44 so I was in the range.

329
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.970
He said it was two 50 when we did rogue and he goes,

330
00:23:21.971 --> 00:23:25.180
I was two 56 so he added another six pounds.

331
00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:30.070
But that's a bird ism because here's why he,

332
00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:35.250
the two 56 is what he weighed after on Thanksgiving after he binge ate and

333
00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:39.280
drank.
So it was an inflated number.
In other words,

334
00:23:39.281 --> 00:23:43.460
he's giving himself too much credit for having lost.
Yup.
Yep.

335
00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:48.350
Maybe he two 50 when he said he was two 40.
Here's the point.

336
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:53.480
We both lost a bunch of legit weight and then on the last couple days we did a

337
00:23:53.481 --> 00:23:54.200
water cut,

338
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:58.760
which is like what wrestlers and fighters do to make waves so miserable because

339
00:23:58.761 --> 00:24:00.850
we both,
because our side bet is this.
Well,

340
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:04.900
here's the other thing I hated the bet was made with Ari Arie Schaffer,
uh,

341
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:08.120
the comedian who,
his whole thing was,

342
00:24:08.121 --> 00:24:11.390
he wanted us to get out of obesity on the BMI scale.
It's really funny,

343
00:24:11.391 --> 00:24:15.050
by the way,
to just be overweight and not obese.
Yeah.
Now,

344
00:24:15.051 --> 00:24:17.930
if you listen to the podcast where the,
where the bet was made,

345
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:22.070
there is height is brought into it and height has an effect on your BMI.

346
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:23.840
This is what people don't know.

347
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:28.160
This is where the discrepancy and all the bickering came afterwards.

348
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:33.610
So if you want to be out of obesity and simply overweight according to the BMI

349
00:24:34.581 --> 00:24:38.330
scale and you're six one,
you are,
uh,

350
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:40.850
I think you have to wait to 27.
Okay.

351
00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:45.050
So the whole thing was like get the two 27 burden.

352
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:50.030
I had a side bet of whoever got lower wins.
Not only that,
the bat,

353
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:54.140
but also the loser would have to shave their beard.
So that was our side bet.

354
00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:59.510
So that's why we kept trying to go below that.
After the bet was initially made,

355
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:04.640
I got a call from,
from Ari Shaffir Arie Schaffer.
Yeah.

356
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:09.500
And we started to go over this bet and he goes,
well,
you know,

357
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:14.780
heightwise if there's a discrepancy between the two of you,
um,

358
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.430
you know,
then he might be able to know,
like,

359
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:20.720
we might be able to weigh more than you.
And I told him I'm not doing that.

360
00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:25.220
<v 3>Right.
So you guys discussed that earlier part,
then the game,</v>

361
00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.460
<v 5>well don't know anything.
Right?
And so for people that go like,</v>

362
00:25:28.461 --> 00:25:30.440
well what do you mean?
I told him,
I go,
dude,

363
00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.620
I'm doing a straight up weight loss challenge with Bert.

364
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:35.600
Like that's what I'm agreeing to.

365
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:40.700
And we had a conversation which he did agree to and I said,

366
00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:44.100
just tell me what the goal weight is and e

367
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:48.350
which in Ari is two 27 okay.

368
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:54.230
Now in
going further in this thing,

369
00:25:54.231 --> 00:25:59.231
we then waited on day one on day one of the way in Burt was two 21 and I was two

370
00:26:02.271 --> 00:26:05.960
19 so we absolutely smashed the goal weight.

371
00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:10.970
<v 3>Great.
I was so nervous by the way.
I was watching on Joe Rogan's website.</v>

372
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.510
Yeah.
Joe Rogan.
What does it.live five yeah.

373
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:18.610
And I was sitting in this room along with the dogs just like freaking out biting

374
00:26:19.041 --> 00:26:21.890
my nails because Burt wait in first.

375
00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:25.220
That's right now going when he got there,
let's say.
Yeah,
let's go.

376
00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:28.040
Let's go through the moment.
When he got to that,
when he got so exciting,

377
00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:32.840
he got to Rogan.
He goes first.
He goes,
yeah,
I'm running there from his house,

378
00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:35.130
his house,
which was like crazy or two miles turn.

379
00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.430
I took an Uber to the corner and then just jog.
Yeah.
Yeah,

380
00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:42.410
but he ran out his house.
Funny how far?
I did not know that had a cop with him.

381
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:43.820
Oh,
areas

382
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.740
<v 5>and I was like,
ah,
I got this.</v>

383
00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:47.623
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

384
00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:53.390
<v 5>I thought maybe Burt doesn't know to avoid fluid.
Yeah,</v>

385
00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.180
so I thought he was going to down a cup of water,
which I was so excited about.

386
00:26:56.181 --> 00:27:00.080
On Day one I was watching him and he was chewing ice and spitting it out and

387
00:27:00.081 --> 00:27:04.520
like chewing.
Some of it's sucking on it because he was dehydrated.
Anyways,
I go,

388
00:27:04.521 --> 00:27:05.450
what do you think you wait?
He's like,

389
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:09.290
I think two 27 like he thought he was at the goal weight and how he was like,

390
00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:13.130
I think I'm shaving my beard.
I go,
okay.
And I looked at him and I knew,
you know,

391
00:27:13.131 --> 00:27:16.040
it looked like he was thinner than he had been.
Yeah,

392
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:19.610
<v 3>he's definitely,
he looks much better.
Yeah,
he looks,
Oh,</v>

393
00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:23.740
<v 5>the other part I have to backtrack before I get to this,
after that,</v>

394
00:27:23.741 --> 00:27:28.060
Ari Shaffer a call about the,
uh,
the goal weight thing,

395
00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:33.010
I immediately called Bert,
which he would attest to and said,
hey,

396
00:27:33.011 --> 00:27:33.730
I just talked to,

397
00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:38.730
to show fear and he's talking about like half inch here and how the boy and Burt

398
00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:41.580
was like,
no,
it's a straight up weight loss shout.

399
00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.960
So that's just for the people who go,
well,

400
00:27:43.961 --> 00:27:46.390
technically if you're hide is this and the BMI,

401
00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:50.470
we agreed to terms,
right?
Yes.

402
00:27:50.471 --> 00:27:53.500
Now when we're waiting,

403
00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:55.780
I really do think Bert must be like two 25.

404
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:59.450
<v 3>So wait,
hold on,
hold on.
But let's back it up a little bit more because I,</v>

405
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:03.600
can we be frank here about what you did the night before that way in.

406
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:06.040
Can we tell the audience really what went down?
Yeah,
sure.

407
00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:10.600
Lunacy that went down in this house because it was fucking,
I,

408
00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.870
I've known you for 12 plus years now.
Yeah.

409
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.890
I have never seen you this laser focus,

410
00:28:16.891 --> 00:28:20.930
this disciplined and this determined to win.
Yeah,
no,

411
00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:23.820
I've seen you focus like I'm,
don't get me wrong,
you're very disciplined.

412
00:28:23.821 --> 00:28:28.680
Even keeled,
dude.
But this was,
I was scared a little by day.

413
00:28:28.681 --> 00:28:29.880
The second day of land,

414
00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:33.720
I was getting a little nervous that something was going to go wrong and then

415
00:28:33.721 --> 00:28:37.930
we'd have to go to the hospital or you'd be sick.
So the neighbor tell,

416
00:28:37.931 --> 00:28:42.330
tell people what you did before the first way.
Okay.
Again,

417
00:28:42.331 --> 00:28:46.050
this is so fucking crazy.
We legit,
we're down.

418
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.890
Both of us were down below the two 27.
Right.
So you knew that you,

419
00:28:49.891 --> 00:28:52.310
you'd already won the general facts.
Yeah.

420
00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:56.990
<v 5>Getting lower.
So I talked to a,
I'm a fighter,
uh,</v>

421
00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:59.410
Jake Smith,
this guy,

422
00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.450
<v 3>to be clear,
you don't,
you'd already won the bet is what you're saying.
Well,</v>

423
00:29:02.451 --> 00:29:04.960
I knew that.
I knew that I was,
you may low the,

424
00:29:04.961 --> 00:29:09.380
made the weight and I'm saying that came from months of eating Kido and doing a

425
00:29:09.381 --> 00:29:11.370
lot of,
you did it.
You did it the right way.
Yeah.

426
00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:15.920
Now what you work I with was having your beard shaved.
Yeah.

427
00:29:15.921 --> 00:29:19.710
And also just the,
when you just want to win,
you want it to,
to yeah.
To be,
yeah.

428
00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:23.850
<v 5>Bert.
Yeah.
Just wanted to win.
So,
uh,
my buddy,</v>

429
00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:28.380
this guy hit me up,
we were talking and he tells me about the week of,

430
00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:29.280
so actually my,

431
00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:34.340
my real cuts started bananas cuts started in Orlando because he told me that,

432
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.620
I'll just tell you what he said.

433
00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:43.030
He said the weight the week before you want to start nothing but distilled
water.

434
00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:47.050
Great.
This is to ensure the body gets into flushing mode.
All right?
Uh,

435
00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.130
drinking lots of water early on the body will downregulate Aldosterone,

436
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.250
a hormone that acts to conserve sodium and secrete potassium.

437
00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:57.850
And when you suddenly reduced the amount of,
you drink in the middle of the week,

438
00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.120
your body will still be in fleshing mode.
You piss a lot.

439
00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:05.590
So some fighters like to reduce the water after Tuesday to three quarters of

440
00:30:05.591 --> 00:30:09.310
Wednesday,
half gallon.
Like I said,
whatever.
He goes,
I personally don't do that.

441
00:30:09.311 --> 00:30:13.900
It's up to you.
Here's how he does it.
Sunday,
two gallons.
Monday,
one gallon,

442
00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:16.750
Tuesday one gallon,
Wednesday one gallon,

443
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.970
Thursday one gallon,

444
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.080
and then you stopped drinking exactly 24 hours before you weigh in Friday.

445
00:30:23.081 --> 00:30:27.460
No water until after you weigh in.
So all I did was water wise,

446
00:30:27.461 --> 00:30:30.880
I did a modified version of what he told me to do.

447
00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.530
What was the modification?

448
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:36.940
I did two gallons on Thursday,

449
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:40.750
one gallon Friday,
one gallon Saturday,

450
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.000
half a gallon Sunday.

451
00:30:43.001 --> 00:30:46.870
And the reason I did that was that I knew that I had two days of weigh ins,

452
00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:50.710
so I knew that I would want to,
it was okay to way to,

453
00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:53.200
to drink more on Sunday before Monday,
way in,

454
00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:56.810
and then drink far less Monday for a Tuesday because we had a two day Wayne.
Oh,

455
00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:01.750
it was crazy.
So the two day,
Wayne,
I know there was more dramatic,
brutal.

456
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:05.110
So what I did was I did all those things with water.
I mean,
I,

457
00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:09.280
I was still eating a very kito diet,

458
00:31:09.281 --> 00:31:14.260
which was like high fat,
moderate protein,
just cleans,
yeah.

459
00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:18.430
In clean.
Um,
and then he also gave me a tip that this,
uh,

460
00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:21.370
Abilene is like this,
uh,
uh,
this,

461
00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:26.350
I know that's a makeup remover.
I think thing,
I don't know.
But anyways,

462
00:31:26.351 --> 00:31:27.190
fighters use it.

463
00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:32.470
You put it all over the body opens up your pores and then you sweat more in a

464
00:31:32.471 --> 00:31:36.370
sweaty situation.
So what I would do is,
um,
at night,

465
00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.950
<v 6>wait a minute,
what you would do or what I would help you do?
Well,</v>

466
00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:44.500
I mean we can we be real here.
It was a,
it was a mommy mommy effort.
Yeah.

467
00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:49.620
<v 5>You're going to take a hot bath,
right?
So we've met who drew a hot bath.
Okay.</v>

468
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:51.720
And then,
uh,
rub that all over.

469
00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:55.850
<v 6>I rubbed that all over your body.
That's right.
And as a dutiful wife,</v>

470
00:31:55.910 --> 00:32:00.550
I shaved your back thoroughly.
It took about half hour.
Did Not Take it.

471
00:32:00.551 --> 00:32:05.150
Yes it did.
No,
I shaved.
You're back down.
Nice and Dolphin smooth.

472
00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.940
And then that shit on your body.

473
00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:12.380
<v 5>Are you getting the hot water?
You,
you getting the hot bath?
Uh,
sweat.
Oh,</v>

474
00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:15.270
and we turn the heat on.
He ends.
That's right.

475
00:32:15.271 --> 00:32:19.620
Heat from the hot water.
Here's another thing I learned and not even from him,

476
00:32:19.621 --> 00:32:21.000
I was just reading about this.

477
00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:25.500
A lot of people get to that sweating and then you shower.

478
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:30.000
Obviously they go home and take a shower.
Now what I read was that some people,

479
00:32:30.001 --> 00:32:32.670
if you're in a sweating mode and you jumped in the shower,

480
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.640
your body reabsorbs water because your pores are open.

481
00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:37.050
So what you're supposed to do,

482
00:32:37.051 --> 00:32:41.390
his towel off between sweats keep toweling off,

483
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:45.260
not shower until after Wayne.
So I did that too.
Yes,
she did.

484
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:49.220
<v 6>And I was sitting in the bathroom with you keeping you company.
Yeah,</v>

485
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.970
and I had to walk out because it was too hot in there and I was going to pass

486
00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:57.320
out.
So I did that at night and then in the morning I would go to Burke Williams,

487
00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:02.920
the spa rubbed the Abilene all over again and then do the steam room.

488
00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:06.980
I know.
And then that would do a is insanity.
10 minutes in five minutes,

489
00:33:06.981 --> 00:33:11.390
not only the bath tub.
Here we have a hot tub and then I went to the hot sun.

490
00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:16.180
You were upset because the hot tub when it go to 104 had it reset and it,

491
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:17.420
and it works now.
Yeah.

492
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:22.340
He called the guy to come and make the hot tub hotter so that you could sweat

493
00:33:22.341 --> 00:33:22.850
more.

494
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:27.530
Now at which point I was getting nervous because you're basically dehydrating

495
00:33:27.531 --> 00:33:27.861
yourself,

496
00:33:27.861 --> 00:33:31.040
which you're used to because you don't drink a lot of water in the first place,

497
00:33:31.041 --> 00:33:35.210
but you are professionally dehydrating yourself and you're not,

498
00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.490
you're not a professional boxer.

499
00:33:37.491 --> 00:33:40.910
Like you just had this email from this dude and you're like,

500
00:33:40.911 --> 00:33:45.440
I'm going to drink distilled water and,
and poison myself here.
So and,

501
00:33:45.441 --> 00:33:48.440
and you did it like a week before.
So I'm Kim,
I'm like,

502
00:33:48.441 --> 00:33:51.320
this got your liver is going to shut down.
I don't know what's going to happen.

503
00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:54.890
I don't like it at all.
I don't like it at all.
Well this is also,

504
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:59.680
<v 5>oh shit.
The uh,
so day one was,
you know,</v>

505
00:33:59.681 --> 00:34:01.690
we weighed in,
um,
two 19.

506
00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.980
<v 6>Okay,
so you two 19 and March two 21.
No,
hold on.</v>

507
00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:07.740
But you go to Pittsburgh bark volumes.
Yeah.

508
00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:11.610
And you sweat before the weigh in.
Right now.
You don't know how,

509
00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:15.090
do you know how much you've lost?
Not really that good morning or no,

510
00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.190
I don't know.
I remember

511
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:18.700
<v 5>that I left the house.
Uh,</v>

512
00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:22.470
well I don't remember this Monday morning I wake up and I think,
um,

513
00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:27.650
I'm like two 21 to 21 is my before I'm right.

514
00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:32.950
So,
so I'm like,
okay,
I eat,
I'd eat a little something.

515
00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:37.630
Just yeah,
get you through the day.
Well,
get to weigh in.
And I actually,

516
00:34:37.631 --> 00:34:40.390
I think I ate too much and I then eat that much.
But I did have a whole egg.

517
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:44.380
Right.
And I think something mixed in with it just because,
I mean,
I was hungry.

518
00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:48.980
Crazy.
Yeah.
And then I'm like,
ah,
I think I ate too much,
but I'm like,
okay,
uh,

519
00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:52.810
I go sweat anyways when I weigh in.
I'm two 19,
so,

520
00:34:52.811 --> 00:34:56.710
which means that I'm two pounds less than when I woke up.
It's not that dramatic,

521
00:34:56.711 --> 00:35:00.250
you know?
Then the next,
then when we get home from Wayne's,

522
00:35:00.251 --> 00:35:05.251
we do the podcast last week and now I'm like really trying to cut water until

523
00:35:05.591 --> 00:35:08.290
the next morning.
Right.
So I have very,

524
00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:13.410
very little between leaving Joe's getting here and the next misery.

525
00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:19.180
And I agree.
I do a two and a half Mile Trek,
uh,

526
00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.380
on the elliptical,

527
00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:25.450
which I was sweating a good bit from then about sanity,

528
00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:28.870
about an hour and a half after that,
I do the hot bath again.

529
00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:34.270
The again towel off,
no water,

530
00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:38.210
and then the next morning,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.
Again,
you're bright.

531
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:41.700
<v 6>You know,
you're,
the story is all from your perspective,</v>

532
00:35:41.701 --> 00:35:46.230
which I understand the other perspective is you're sitting at the dinner table,

533
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:46.951
little jeans,

534
00:35:46.951 --> 00:35:51.930
maybe jeans and I were trying to like have a dinner and you're just suffering.

535
00:35:51.931 --> 00:35:54.690
Like I can see it in your eyes.
Your eyes are sunken in.

536
00:35:54.691 --> 00:35:58.700
You got these dark circles,
you're just fucking miserable.

537
00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.590
You can't even drink water.
And at which point you're like,
I just,

538
00:36:01.591 --> 00:36:04.890
I got to go upstairs.
I got to go.
I wanted to distract myself.
Miserable.
Yeah.

539
00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.890
<v 5>I want it to distract myself.
It was horrible.
Part of it would be like,</v>

540
00:36:07.891 --> 00:36:10.500
I would get so tired that sometimes I could fall.

541
00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:12.630
All you wanted to do with false of course.

542
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.450
And then I would also try to just distract.

543
00:36:15.451 --> 00:36:18.960
So I would read an article and then realized I was losing myself in the,

544
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:23.850
which was good.
Yeah.
So that time,
and then the hardest part was the,

545
00:36:23.851 --> 00:36:27.810
um,
the night before and the morning I was the hardest part.

546
00:36:27.811 --> 00:36:29.430
But so the night before you fall asleep,
you're like,

547
00:36:29.431 --> 00:36:33.570
thank God we get up at six 30.
I know we have an 1130 way in.

548
00:36:33.571 --> 00:36:38.250
So the first thing I say to you is five hours.
I got five hours on.
Horrible.

549
00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.450
And then we're downstairs,
we're going to breakfast with a little ear man.

550
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:46.200
And then I looked at seven 30.
I'm like,
I got four hours at a time.
It's eight 30.

551
00:36:46.201 --> 00:36:48.030
I was like,
I know I need to get ready to get going.

552
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:53.430
So I do remember the album and again,
everywhere.
It was horrible this time.

553
00:36:53.431 --> 00:36:58.431
I know also that I didn't push myself as much as I could have in that steam

554
00:36:58.531 --> 00:36:59.130
room.

555
00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:03.750
So I know to do it more like to push it harder the second day.

556
00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:08.400
So I know to like stay in a little longer and I know to do it for longer.

557
00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.520
So I do that.
The second day I did it for longer.

558
00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:16.620
<v 6>Now one thing I noticed that wasn't in your regimen was a good old fashioned,</v>

559
00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:23.290
um,
taking a shit like you didn't know the cleanse.
Yeah.

560
00:37:23.291 --> 00:37:24.130
Cause I feel like,

561
00:37:24.131 --> 00:37:28.750
and I gave you the diet or tea and I went to get and you didn't shit.

562
00:37:28.751 --> 00:37:31.690
And I felt like you could lose another five or 10 pounds of just shit.

563
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:35.710
I think it was picking a lane.
I was picking a lane.
You picked water over dump.

564
00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:40.450
I picked water.
Oh,
I can't,
can't you do both?
Don't,
I mean,

565
00:37:40.451 --> 00:37:44.890
do you boxers shit in addition to sweat?
Yeah,
I guess.

566
00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.810
I guess so.
Yeah.
I just,
I,

567
00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:52.170
the thing was I was consuming so little food right the last 72 hours that I

568
00:37:52.751 --> 00:37:54.930
don't think that there was,
you say that.
Yeah.

569
00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:59.320
But you'd be surprised because I accidentally drank some dieters t in college

570
00:37:59.321 --> 00:38:02.740
and I wasn't eating a lot to have one.
I did it.
You need more.

571
00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:04.060
I told you you got to double bag.

572
00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:08.230
And I remember when you think there's no brown in you,
there's all,

573
00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:12.010
there's always a lot of brown in you.
There's always a lot of brown in you.

574
00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.330
I know.
I'll never be doing that again.
It was terrible.
Horrible.

575
00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:16.580
Terrible to watch the next,

576
00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:21.470
<v 5>oh,
I hate it.
I went in again,
I was two 16.
Yeah.</v>

577
00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:26.150
Which means I lost an additional three pounds.
Crazy.
Just from sweating.
Yeah.

578
00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:31.160
And then this crazy,
or it was two 20 so he lost one pound.
So it was,
it was,

579
00:38:31.161 --> 00:38:36.010
you know,
it was over.
I started to drink fluid there.

580
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:40.580
Right.
And so the first thing we did was drink these,
uh,

581
00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:45.880
coke CO2,
I forget.
It's called,
um,
coconut water,
right?

582
00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.900
Yeah.
They're big man.
They're like 27 ounces or something.

583
00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:54.040
So we're so dehydrated,
the down,
no problem.

584
00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:59.080
Then he has 16.9 ounce bottles of water,
which is like,
you know,

585
00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:04.240
like uh,
how many of those,

586
00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:09.040
it's like this is 50.7.
Okay,

587
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:14.190
well I drink six to 16.9 ounce bottles of six of you feel your body goes.

588
00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:21.490
No,
it felt I was so dehydrated that it felt completely normal.

589
00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:25.480
Then I had a second of the coconut,

590
00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:29.980
the big 20 ounce bottles of thing and somebody texted me and I don't even know

591
00:39:29.981 --> 00:39:32.860
if it's correct,
but let me see.
Uh,

592
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:36.960
how many ounces are in a gallon?
Um,

593
00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:38.860
as it might be.

594
00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:43.150
It's 100 2,828 gallons.

595
00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:46.210
128 ounces are in a gallon.

596
00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:49.810
So cause somebody pointed this out to me.

597
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.990
Yeah.
I he's like,
you just casually drank a gallon of fluid.

598
00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:59.290
That's how dehydrated I was.
Oh,
the whole thing is that I was,

599
00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:03.610
I drank that amount and didn't go pee.
That's crazy.
You're poor body.

600
00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:09.340
Do that again.
I never want to do that again.
Horrible.

601
00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:12.760
We both said that to each other though.
Like I would never ever do that.

602
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:18.030
Then I got to shave Burt's beard and he laughed and he gave him a Puerto Rican.

603
00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:23.050
I tried to,
yeah,
that was the best part.
If you look it up on youtube,
it's really,

604
00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:27.300
it's uh,
we laugh,
we laughed so hard looking at each other through it.
Um,

605
00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:30.760
but it just type in Thompson gross shaves,
Burns beard.

606
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:34.580
And it's really fun man.
So anyways,
um,

607
00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:37.180
I'm going to do a special weight loss,

608
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:41.710
a podcast at some point here and I'll put it up.

609
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:46.270
It'll just be an extra episode.
And um,
I'll get into detail about the whole,

610
00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:47.710
the whole journey.
Yeah.
I mean,

611
00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.880
I'm in workout gear right now because I'm going to go from the podcast to go

612
00:40:51.881 --> 00:40:56.230
work out good for you jeans.
Um,
okay.
So,

613
00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:58.930
and many thanks to Joe and then the bet,
the bet afterwards.

614
00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:00.340
So here's what happened.

615
00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:04.300
The discrepancy became about the BMI because we were supposed to get out of

616
00:41:04.301 --> 00:41:08.080
obesity and into overweight.
So,
so our,
he's like,
yeah,

617
00:41:08.081 --> 00:41:11.050
but I want to know your height now because so now he's going back to the

618
00:41:11.051 --> 00:41:15.850
original and I go,
yeah,
but you agreed to the two 27 goal weight.

619
00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:20.770
He's like,
he has,
he has like Amnesia,
right?
So now he's like,
no,
no,
no,
no.

620
00:41:20.771 --> 00:41:25.540
I want to know your height.
So we measure my height without shoes obviously.

621
00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:29.350
Um,
and I'm just under six feet.

622
00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:34.440
So technically I'm five 11 and like eight five 11.85 so,

623
00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:41.920
but I'm closer to six feet then I am the five 11 most of the online BMI things

624
00:41:42.831 --> 00:41:46.490
where like you had to pick an inch,
you know,
like a,
a good round number.

625
00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:48.560
So if you did five 11

626
00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:54.350
I'm not in the correct whatever BMI for it.
If you had six feet,

627
00:41:54.351 --> 00:41:58.020
you're giving me too much credit and I go,
yeah,
but you got,
so anyway,

628
00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:01.640
somebody found one that had five 11.5 which I'm taller than.

629
00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:04.160
Turns out I was

630
00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:05.600
<v 0>okay</v>

631
00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:10.440
<v 5>at the correct way to win,
but only on day two,
not on day one.
Okay.</v>

632
00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:14.930
So then Ari
said that he wasn't going to pay.

633
00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:16.243
Um,

634
00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:20.930
he got bombarded with people calling them out.

635
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:26.210
Uh,
Joe then was like saying that he wanted to,
uh,
you know,

636
00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:28.070
take like send us,

637
00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:32.140
<v 6>you know,
some ways going to assume Ari's dead.
He said,
and then,</v>

638
00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:34.020
but then to be fair,
gentlemanly,

639
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:37.970
<v 5>to be,
to be fair to Ari a couple days later,</v>

640
00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:41.960
I don't know if it's because he got so much hatred or he just had a a moment.

641
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:47.530
He wrote this really sweet email to Bertrand and I about like how proud he was

642
00:42:49.041 --> 00:42:53.540
of us and how we're going to be alive now longer and,
and how he's like,

643
00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:57.320
whatever it costs are now.
He said he's going to do it.
He's going to do it.

644
00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.760
I approved juice.

645
00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:00.740
<v 6>Yeah.
So he should,
yeah.</v>

646
00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:04.280
You guys worked very hard and 10 to Welch on that.

647
00:43:04.281 --> 00:43:05.760
That would have been really shitty.

648
00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.770
<v 5>Well,
the truth is that,
you know,</v>

649
00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:11.970
I think we both did it outside of the,

650
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:15.150
the weight that the stakes,
but you know what I mean?

651
00:43:15.151 --> 00:43:19.260
Like that was just the icing on the cake,
right.
That there was some payoff.

652
00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:22.920
We didn't do it because we wanted to go to a fucking game.

653
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:26.970
We did it because we wanted to do it right.
We wanted to get help.

654
00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:30.260
<v 6>But that's what I'm saying,
that it's especially shitty for someone.
Yeah,
yeah,</v>

655
00:43:30.261 --> 00:43:33.890
yeah.
Who,
if he didn't do it,
you know,
take knowledge,

656
00:43:33.891 --> 00:43:37.580
the amount of work and yeah,
that you guys put in because that's a ton of work

657
00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:39.100
<v 5>to be clear.
The three of us,</v>

658
00:43:39.101 --> 00:43:44.080
we're all all of means to deal with the repercussions if we didn't do it.

659
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:46.630
So it's not like talking to like,

660
00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.120
<v 6>it's not about what I'm saying,
it's not about money.</v>

661
00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:53.050
It's more about the acknowledgement and the gesture of hey,
you did it,

662
00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:56.350
you did it.
Good job,
good job.
But only you only say that once a day.

663
00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:58.150
You don't want too many good jobs.

664
00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:03.420
<v 5>Yeah.
I just think that Jews are great.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,</v>

665
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:08.430
so there you go.
Um,
it's over.

666
00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:12.180
I'm back to being normal and by normal I just mean,

667
00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:17.680
<v 6>and then so when you were done with the bet the next day night,
no,</v>

668
00:44:17.681 --> 00:44:22.330
it was later that day.
Cause you guys ordered pizza and in Joe's studio,

669
00:44:22.331 --> 00:44:25.030
and I had a piece and not even a half,

670
00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:28.390
but that wasn't your jam cause you're a jam is sweets and you haven't had

671
00:44:28.391 --> 00:44:32.070
pastries in like months.
So the very first thing we did,
we

672
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.640
<v 3>got in the car and we found you a waffle place.
Yeah,</v>

673
00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:36.060
we got you Chuckii croissant.

674
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:38.630
But we didn't get to go to the waffle place I wanted to go to and now it's

675
00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:39.480
closed already.

676
00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:44.360
<v 5>I know.
So we'll have to do a waffle date again.
But we did go and um,</v>

677
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:48.800
we had,
uh,
some sweets and uh,
you know,
I gotta tell you though,
the,

678
00:44:48.801 --> 00:44:51.170
the fantasy of them was better than the re then actually.
Yeah.

679
00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:55.310
<v 3>It kind of is because here's the thing,
when you have a little craving,
yeah.</v>

680
00:44:55.550 --> 00:45:00.140
I've found that just taking three bites is enough cause like,
oh,
I enjoyed that.

681
00:45:00.141 --> 00:45:04.390
And if you go any for any further,
yeah,
now you're just punishing yourself.

682
00:45:04.391 --> 00:45:07.010
You're,
you're kind of overdoing it and then you're not going to feel good.

683
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:09.690
<v 5>Yeah.
And I didn't go cray.
I people were like,</v>

684
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:12.280
you don't understand what's going to happen right now.
I was like,
dude,

685
00:45:12.281 --> 00:45:14.720
and that's kind of not eating that much,
you know?
Yeah.

686
00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:16.620
I think the Instagram photos you posted,

687
00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:21.810
people think it was like a real hardcore binge.
I'm like,
I had a cookie,

688
00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:24.310
a bite of the other thing,
and then the

689
00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:27.690
<v 3>and magic around,
uh,
three quarters of a chocolate croissant.</v>

690
00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:30.450
I didn't have three quarters of a chocolate croissant.
What did you have?

691
00:45:30.451 --> 00:45:33.750
One quarter of a chocolatier as well then.
There you go.
Yeah,
it wasn't a lot.

692
00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:35.910
That's my point guys.
It's the media.

693
00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:39.500
<v 5>Yeah.
I know the mainstream media was like totally distorting,</v>

694
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:41.030
distorting what's happening to you.

695
00:45:41.031 --> 00:45:44.060
And I haven't been emailing any of these people,
you know,

696
00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:48.720
<v 3>showing your Peter what?
Huh?
Okay.
Mimi,
Mimi.</v>

697
00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:51.460
But congratulations.
I'm very proud of you.

698
00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:56.140
And last week was very happy week in this house when you one yeah,

699
00:45:56.230 --> 00:46:00.070
it was great.
Everybody was pulling for you and it was very exciting.

700
00:46:00.071 --> 00:46:01.270
And then day two of the weigh ins,

701
00:46:01.271 --> 00:46:06.130
I remember I was sitting in my car and I was watching on my phone.

702
00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.033
Yeah.

703
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:13.180
And I had to pull the car over and like scream you all.

704
00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:14.020
I'd really,

705
00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:17.290
I was so nervous for you cause I didn't know what Burt was going to do.
Right.

706
00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:21.400
I mean I thought maybe burn had figured out cause there's a minute where Joe was

707
00:46:21.401 --> 00:46:26.320
telling Bert that he should be sweating it out and I saw your luck cause I know

708
00:46:26.321 --> 00:46:28.270
you so well.
They'll look on your face of like no,
no,
no.

709
00:46:28.271 --> 00:46:30.520
She didn't say anything to him and I thought Oh my God,

710
00:46:30.521 --> 00:46:33.190
if Burt goes home today and goes to sweat it out,

711
00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:36.730
he could take Tom because he had to win.
He had,

712
00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:40.000
he just had to overtake you by two and a half pounds.
That was the bet.

713
00:46:40.001 --> 00:46:43.140
And he could have done that if he took a shit or sweat now.

714
00:46:43.141 --> 00:46:45.610
But he couldn't have done it because I was,

715
00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:48.880
I mean he could have been competitive,
more competitive,
but he,

716
00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:51.910
I was already ahead of him so I was right.
You know,
he,

717
00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:53.890
he was starting at a disadvantage,

718
00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:58.720
know for him to make up and then beat me.
My,
he would have had to to drop,

719
00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:02.620
you know,
I mean it's possible.
Are so far ahead with the sweating.

720
00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:06.550
Well I wasn't that far ahead or two and a half pounds.
Two pounds.

721
00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:08.140
That's why I was dramatic with it though.
Right.

722
00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:10.900
Cause you didn't know what he was going to do that day.
That's right.

723
00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.540
Thankfully not much.
He actually just,

724
00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:17.410
he says he ran eight miles.
Um,

725
00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:20.980
I found out that he run walks,
let's not give them to wait a minute.

726
00:47:20.981 --> 00:47:24.400
So all those times he was showing the treadmill and he's like,
I did 22 miles.

727
00:47:24.401 --> 00:47:25.234
How did he do that?

728
00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:28.960
Did he just let it run the treadmill for like two hours and then he covered?

729
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:33.280
But what he would do is he would post it like I just covered miles.
He goes,

730
00:47:33.281 --> 00:47:35.770
I would get up in the morning and he's still would deserve credit for the work,

731
00:47:35.771 --> 00:47:40.300
but he would get up,
go in the,
in the,
um,
his man cave.
Yeah.

732
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:45.210
Get on the treadmill,
do three miles,
hit pause.
Oh,

733
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:50.470
for the day it's paused.
He would go about his day,
maybe go to a meeting,

734
00:47:50.471 --> 00:47:55.240
whatever.
Take the girls somewhere,
come home five miles.
Hilarious.

735
00:47:55.241 --> 00:47:59.770
Hit pause.
So now it's logged eight miles.
Sure,
sure,
sure.
Then he might walk,

736
00:47:59.771 --> 00:48:03.090
he said like three or four miles.
Yeah.
Keep it going.

737
00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:05.950
So he just kept it going at the talent.
Just kept a tally going,
which is,

738
00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:10.190
I love it.
He fooled you on the day of,
he's like,
I jogged here.
No,
no.

739
00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:13.810
I remember the day before he goes,
I'm a job there in the morning.
And I was like,

740
00:48:13.811 --> 00:48:17.170
no.
Hilarious.
Yeah,
I did check and then I go,

741
00:48:17.171 --> 00:48:21.330
where are you shyster cause he was late and he goes,
I'm on like,
you know,

742
00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:24.670
on the street.
And I go,
you're,
you jogged here from real.
He's like,
yeah.

743
00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:29.040
And then as I walk out with Jamie and we look and he's like,

744
00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:34.510
like waving at his track suit on and uh,
and then Jamie's like,

745
00:48:34.511 --> 00:48:37.090
he took it number and I go,
did you just take an Uber?
He's like,
yeah,

746
00:48:37.091 --> 00:48:40.810
but dropped me off around there.
So he jog like the last hundred yards.

747
00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:45.280
It's funny.
Yeah.
Oh,
alright.
Yeah,

748
00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.340
it looks much better.
Much better than he does.
I mean,

749
00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:52.600
I was just looking at a photo of him that was posted a while ago and he does

750
00:48:52.601 --> 00:48:56.560
look like half the guy now,
Pam.
And it doesn't look bad without the beard shaved.

751
00:48:56.700 --> 00:49:00.280
You know,
I do want to talk to Leanne about this and get her perspective.

752
00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:03.970
She's mad at us are thankful I can't,
I don't know.
Yeah.

753
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.120
Last time we had them over for dinner and I,

754
00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:09.970
I pulled her aside and I was legally and please tell me honestly,

755
00:49:09.971 --> 00:49:13.930
is all this fat shaming bothering?
Yeah.
Bird is this bothering you?

756
00:49:13.931 --> 00:49:14.950
Is this ruining your life?

757
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:19.300
And she and her wonderful Leanne way was like,

758
00:49:19.301 --> 00:49:22.700
well you know Burt's going to do at Burt wants to do.
Yeah.
And I was like,
oh,

759
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:26.440
okay.
I guess that's not a no.
Yeah.
That,
so that means keep shaming him.

760
00:49:26.441 --> 00:49:31.150
It's also a very uh,
Leanne answer.
Yeah.
Well it's true cause yeah.

761
00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:35.170
Is going to do at bird's to,
do you remember the UV Micah?
Yes.

762
00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:37.360
Most exciting man on the Internet.

763
00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:39.370
<v 6>Yeah.
He might have the capsules for me,</v>

764
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:43.240
the already 20 and the [inaudible] as you can see,
they're quite different.

765
00:49:43.241 --> 00:49:47.950
So we are already three 20 uses the same capsule design is in the Ari 27 and d

766
00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:53.540
each had very well the face sports you already 20s or external and gallery three

767
00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:55.910
corners are integrated into the capsules.
Sure.

768
00:49:56.690 --> 00:50:00.330
The Ori 20 uses of standard gas 20

769
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:04.320
magnet to create even the title.

770
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:07.600
<v 3>How are you three two,
one versus already joining?
Yeah,</v>

771
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:10.780
<v 6>VRE 20 sensitivity is 1.5 millivolts per.</v>

772
00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:15.570
<v 3>So there's a competition now to see if anything could be more boring.</v>

773
00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:20.870
Maybe your personality and there's a submission for it.

774
00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:23.680
Even hear that baby.
It's you can't,

775
00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:27.150
you have to understand like you're going to get your feelings hurt so badly.

776
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:31.570
This I actually feel bad actually what I might have to like wink at a few people

777
00:50:31.571 --> 00:50:36.360
and be like,
Hey,
she's not fun.
No one thinks you're more fun.
Um,

778
00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:42.830
so here is the competition has,
oh for the most boring club,
more boring.

779
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:48.580
Here at Rockwell automations world headquarters,

780
00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:52.120
we search has been proceeding to develop a line of automation products that

781
00:50:52.121 --> 00:50:54.310
establishes a new standards for quality,

782
00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:59.140
logical leadership and operating article already with customer success.

783
00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:03.730
As our primary focus work has been proceeding on the crudely conceived idea of

784
00:51:03.731 --> 00:51:06.710
an instrument that would not only provide in books.
Correct,

785
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:08.830
we're using unilateral phase detractors,

786
00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:13.750
but would also be capable of automatically synchronizing cardinal grand meters,

787
00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:19.480
Rockwell automations,
retro and calculator.
Basically,

788
00:51:19.481 --> 00:51:23.470
the only new principal involved is that instead of power being generated by the

789
00:51:23.471 --> 00:51:25.600
relative motion of conductors and fluxes,

790
00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:27.130
I don't even know what he's talking about of it.

791
00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:32.280
It's produced by the Modell interaction or reluctance and capacitive director is

792
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:33.870
he making these words up?

793
00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:38.320
Sounds are made up and [inaudible] had a base plate of prefabricated amulet

794
00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:43.520
surmount the casing in such a way that the two spring bearings ran a direct line

795
00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:46.180
with the standard metric fam.

796
00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:51.150
The lineup consistent simply of six copy Marzel veins.
It's fantastic.

797
00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:54.870
All fit into the but patient lunar Wayne Chap,
that side fumbling,

798
00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:59.140
it was effectively prevented who understand this video.

799
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:01.720
The main winding was of the normal Lotus,

800
00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:06.610
so deltoid type placed in Penn Intermix,
Semi Bolo in slots of the stator Jesus.

801
00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:10.750
Every seventh conductor being connected by a nonreversible tremie pipe to the

802
00:52:10.751 --> 00:52:15.370
differential girdle spring on the,
there's like a Simpsons character.

803
00:52:15.850 --> 00:52:17.710
Blue Band is blue band messing with me.

804
00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:23.050
Do you think this guy is a host and he just got hired for this industrial

805
00:52:23.051 --> 00:52:27.400
hundred percent he has a,
he's like,
he had to learn kind of what this crap was.

806
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:31.920
Unless,
is this just a bit,
I don't,
I don't think so.
Moreover,

807
00:52:31.921 --> 00:52:33.900
whenever a fluorescent score motion is required,

808
00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:38.000
it may also be employed in conjunction with a drawn reciprocation.
Dingo alarm.

809
00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:41.260
Can we do on the soil?
Do you plan oration?
No.

810
00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:45.450
The Rachio and calculator has no race.
No goddammit real words.

811
00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:49.300
The diploma rater and the,
please tell me that the FARC urinated.

812
00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:52.600
I hadn't seen that.
I just saw like the opening five seconds and I was like,
oh,

813
00:52:52.601 --> 00:52:55.820
this is boring.
I didn't actually,

814
00:52:55.821 --> 00:53:00.580
I hear his deformity in the flapper neighbors there and totally fake [inaudible]

815
00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:04.210
by the [inaudible].
Moran is,
yeah.

816
00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:09.130
Do you want to see a dad boner nonsense?
Yeah.
It's like it's a guy jerking off.

817
00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:12.430
Okay.
Now this is a,
uh,

818
00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:14.800
a super,

819
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:19.950
Super Dad Boehner who he doesn't get quite as excited as our glass of,

820
00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:24.700
yeah,
our glasses,
color moose.
Super ultimate bad

821
00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:27.283

822
00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:35.190

Don't know where it is.</v>

828
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:03.223

good moment,

831
00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:23.740

I think that'd be fun.
Yeah.

832
00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:25.243

00:54:31.830 --> 00:54:33.150
<v 0>Oh Lord.</v>

835
00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:34.973
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

836
00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:44.870
Right.
It's really,
oh my God.

837
00:54:45.130 --> 00:54:49.180
Now Evie,
my guy.
So look the,
it's obvious.
The,

838
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:53.610
the thing that's been taken over the world by storm has been,

839
00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:54.931
Hi Mommy,

840
00:54:54.931 --> 00:54:59.610
thanks genes and last weekend of the suck site.

841
00:54:59.611 --> 00:55:03.900
And that is how we ordered when whenever we have a drive through a experience.

842
00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:07.310
Yes.
We say hi Mommy.
And we say thanks jeans.
Yes.

843
00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:12.410
And it has you added glass into it than other people that it is taken on.

844
00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:14.730
It's exploded.

845
00:55:14.731 --> 00:55:19.731
We had two blue and had to send selects because we had over 50 some submissive

846
00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:23.760
missions.
People doing this and it would just be an entire show.

847
00:55:23.761 --> 00:55:26.940
But sweeping the nation in the world.
There are some really,

848
00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:31.670
and I have to tell you,
if you haven't done it yet,
do it because you feel,
yeah.

849
00:55:31.770 --> 00:55:34.130
Even if you don't fill it,
it's such a,
it's a felony,

850
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:37.980
but it feels like such a sense of accomplishment.
You feel so fun.

851
00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:42.300
It's so fun to like,
you got one in on.
Yeah.
It's harmless.
Yeah.

852
00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:46.570
Hurting someone's feelings.
Yeah,
it's good fun.
So here is a,

853
00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:52.020
here's one that I saw.
That is absolutely,
I think this is a master for one.

854
00:55:52.021 --> 00:55:54.650
Hold on,
let me pull this up.
These are these good.
They'd be,

855
00:55:54.651 --> 00:55:57.780
they've gotten better and better every week.
Let's see where this happened.

856
00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:02.240
<v 8>Hello jeans.
Sorry about that.
That's okay.
Mommy.</v>

857
00:56:02.241 --> 00:56:05.780
I can I just get a number six and number three?
Yeah,

858
00:56:05.781 --> 00:56:10.430
but with the ketchup instead of,
yeah,

859
00:56:10.431 --> 00:56:11.264
that would be amazing.

860
00:56:12.690 --> 00:56:17.210
And can I check off whether that could be my Lord?
You know what,

861
00:56:17.211 --> 00:56:19.740
I'm going to go full Burke Chrysler and could I just get it?

01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:13.710
ask me to shifting is it?
And I heard the Fart Mike.
Huh?

957
01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:19.460
Did it register?
No,
you're kidding.
I mean,
I'm sure they heard it,

958
01:03:19.461 --> 01:03:22.280
but it didn't register.
Oh,
so upsetting.
Yeah.

959
01:03:22.310 --> 01:03:26.390
You did all that work and then no one's here to acknowledge these chairs,

960
01:03:26.391 --> 01:03:29.330
like you've said before,
they're not conducive to farting.
Yeah.

961
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:32.070
You got to really lean over.
You got to practically lane,

962
01:03:32.110 --> 01:03:33.650
you're in your shit hammock.
True.

963
01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:38.843
<v 9>Tom,</v>

964
01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:42.220
<v 6>what do you think was the process leading up to that?</v>

965
01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:48.480
<v 2>Because that's not where I would go first.
Oh,</v>

966
01:03:48.481 --> 01:03:53.190
it took a little bit of work.
It was like,
I don't know.

967
01:03:53.191 --> 01:03:56.910
How do you coach someone into that?
Yeah.
You don't just say,

968
01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:01.850
you gotta take a shit.
It's like,
would you do something?
You know what I mean?

969
01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:05.580
Like what's the,
what do you think his first time doing it was like,
well,

970
01:04:05.581 --> 01:04:07.770
he's like,
can you just squat over my face?
And the girls are like,

971
01:04:07.771 --> 01:04:12.720
my thighs are burning.
Oh,
right.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I think he was just like,
yeah,

972
01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:15.930
just squat.
And then he was like,
hold on to this while you squat,

973
01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:19.430
like gave him a row.
He starts with a rep and they're like,
my thighs still burn.

974
01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:24.270
Then it was like a box with a hole in it.
Like a bucket maybe.
Yeah,

975
01:04:24.271 --> 01:04:26.720
I would have done that.
But then how does he sit under a buck?

976
01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:30.660
And he realized that he's in Belize in those hammocks everywhere and people are

977
01:04:30.661 --> 01:04:33.780
laying around and he was like,
dude of Hammock.
Is that right?
Perfect.

978
01:04:33.781 --> 01:04:37.090
Shitting instrument.
It's kind of ingenious.
What do you think of it this way?

979
01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:42.210
Yeah.
Um,

Are you doing?
I don't know.
Oh,
what for Valentine's Day?

1027
01:07:46.770 --> 01:07:50.850
I don't know yet.
It hasn't been,
it hasn't been determined.
Okay.
And there's,

1028
01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:53.610
you know,
nothing came up.
No.
All right.

1029
01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:56.640
Maybe we're working on that shit man.

1030
01:07:57.310 --> 01:08:01.150
<v 5>You know what I'm saying?
You feel me?
Don't talk about,
you know what I'm saying?</v>

1031
01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:06.190
This is funny.
Um,
the uh,
you know,

1032
01:08:06.191 --> 01:08:09.970
the male or the,
the dad accent.
Yeah.

1033
01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:12.430
So a guy in a documentary,

1034
01:08:12.850 --> 01:08:16.640
they get to a mail order bride start speaking English with an accent.

1035
01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:18.260
Cool.

1036
01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:23.060
And so you can actually hear and then the narrator to makes it clear that he's

1037
01:08:23.061 --> 01:08:25.010
doing that.
They does a dad accident for her.

1038
01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.730
Here's the guy which doing FIFO.

1039
01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:30.620
<v 12>Oh No,
no,
no.</v>

1040
01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:36.710
<v 5>So this guy,</v>

1041
01:08:37.650 --> 01:08:38.700
<v 12>welcome to America</v>

1042
01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:41.520
<v 5>doesn't speak with that accent,
right?
Yeah.</v>

1043
01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:44.760
He's just a regular good welcome to America.

1044
01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:49.710
I don't think that a lot of us have experienced this with our own dads.
And um,

1045
01:08:49.770 --> 01:08:50.580
yeah.
If,

1046
01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:55.260
if you have an American dad and he tries to connect with somebody from another

1047
01:08:55.261 --> 01:09:00.261
place that a he'd sometimes it talks English the way they talk to maybe,

1048
01:09:02.010 --> 01:09:07.010
maybe you understand more when I say it the way I think you would say instead of

1049
01:09:07.681 --> 01:09:10.170
just speaking to them in English.
Um,

1050
01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:13.800
was it last week that we played the soccer player?
Yeah.
Or wake before,

1051
01:09:14.010 --> 01:09:17.250
was it the week before that?
Anyways,
we got some feedback on that.

1052
01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:21.720
Well also that he's not Irish,
but the cheat sheets that Irish,

1053
01:09:21.721 --> 01:09:25.110
you gotta blame blue band on that one.
Everybody was like,

1054
01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:29.670
he's not Irish mate fucker.
I think he's from Liverpool,
Liverpool.

1055
01:09:29.730 --> 01:09:34.290
But uh,
but,
but that was 100% blame,
blame blue band.
Um,

1056
01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:37.530
so here,
listen to the narrator talk about how this guy is doing this

1057
01:09:37.750 --> 01:09:42.310
<v 12>to help Olga understand his English.
Gary speaks to her with a Russian accent.</v>

1058
01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:47.830
I know you understand much.
You will,
you will ask me.
You will tell me.

1059
01:09:47.831 --> 01:09:49.270
I don't understand

1060
01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:55.570
if you do not say I don't understand,
I keep talking.

1061
01:09:57.690 --> 01:10:00.580
<v 3>Do you think that helps her like I don't think so.</v>

1062
01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:05.500
I'm trying to think of me speaking me to another language and I always think

1063
01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:10.501
I've responded better just hearing them speak however the languages to,

1064
01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:13.900
because it doesn't help you when they cause what they do.

1065
01:10:13.901 --> 01:10:15.850
When someone does that to you and you're trying to understand,

1066
01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:18.580
it complicates things in your brain because you're like,
wait,

1067
01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:20.950
what are you saying now?
And then you know that it's off.

1068
01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:24.700
Like you know that it's not correct.
Yeah.
So party.
He was like,
well,
I wish,

1069
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:28.450
I wish I was hearing how to say it correctly because then you'd learn it

1070
01:10:28.451 --> 01:10:32.560
correctly.
Right,
right.
Yeah.
It's a total,
it is a dad.
Oh Wow.

1071
01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:37.540
That's so crazy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They totally called him out too.
Yeah.
Well,
I mean,

1072
01:10:37.541 --> 01:10:41.170
they're like,
they have to talk like point out why he's being retarded.

1073
01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.370
These poor women.

1074
01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:46.940
Could you imagine that's your way out of this country out of Russia.
Oh,

1075
01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:51.580
is some fucking dip shit from,
we watched that one documentary,
God,

1076
01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:53.820
and it was like the saddest dude's.
Yeah.

1077
01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:57.340
And they would go to these meetups and then they're like,
I like,
you know,

1078
01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:01.000
she's like,
I like money.
I mean,
I like you two are the worst,

1079
01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:04.870
<v 5>you know,
this is how bad it is.
Some of those women were in dire,</v>

1080
01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:07.010
just like bad situations,

1081
01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:12.400
and the guy was so unfuckable and such a desperate,

1082
01:11:12.621 --> 01:11:14.160
sad that

1083
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.350
<v 3>the women would go like,
no,
I'll stay.</v>

1084
01:11:16.530 --> 01:11:21.320
I'd rather I'd rather live in a shit.
Horrible country.
Yeah.

1085
01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:22.830
This froze.

1086
01:11:22.831 --> 01:11:27.570
I applaud shit box of the country and the Ukraine.

1087
01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:31.620
They go with you.
Yeah.
Some of them were in bad.

1088
01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:34.310
They showed them when he's like living in horrible,
you know,

1089
01:11:34.410 --> 01:11:38.880
tiny apartment with 10 people and they go,
you know,
this is my only chance out.

1090
01:11:38.881 --> 01:11:43.620
And then they would meet fucking Sam,
you know,
from such monsters.

1091
01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:49.230
They meet the,
uh,
the guy that invented McAfee.
Oh yeah.
You want a hundred bucks?

1092
01:11:49.290 --> 01:11:54.270
No,
her bucks.
You could take a shit.
Yeah,
I got ticket.
Boop.
Yeah.

1093
01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:57.790
Do it in the hammock.
Are you sure they all be done?

1094
01:11:57.830 --> 01:12:01.570
I'm going to be fixing some stuff underneath it.
I got to fix it.
Uh,

1095
01:12:02.130 --> 01:12:06.750
so that's like,
as the shit comes out,
he jerks off.
Oh,
is that what he's doing?

1096
01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:10.620
Well,
he says fecal sex and they go,
did you ever have intercourse?
And he goes,

1097
01:12:10.650 --> 01:12:15.240
they go,
no,
never scat sex.
Got Sex.
Shit's,

1098
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:17.610
he goes off.
Wow.
Wow.

1099
01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:22.590
What a Gig Gig.
Sure.
Those chicks are still like,

1100
01:12:22.591 --> 01:12:26.280
I've kind of where she was back here,
you know.
Well,
it's easy money.

1101
01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:30.390
It is a win win.
I got to shit.
I like to sit down when my shit,

1102
01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:33.380
you've got the hammock.
You've got the mouth.
Yeah.

1103
01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:38.730
Now he likes it fresh out of the oven.
That is just wild.

1104
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.390
How does he not vomit?
Do you think he eats the shit or he just spits it out?

1105
01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:48.750
Yeah.
But even like here,
your nose is right there.

1106
01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:51.390
A fresh Turd.

1107
01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:58.290
Most of us have that reaction that,
that,
that not good reaction.

1108
01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:00.600
Um,
but I dunno,
he doesn't,
you know,

1109
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:08.560
<v 9>come on man.
He's fun.</v>

1110
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:11.623
He's not barfing

1111
01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:17.110
barfing he's just cleaning a shower.
Drain.

1112
01:13:24.410 --> 01:13:26.550
There's a smell sometimes.
Yeah.

1113
01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:31.720
<v 3>So the problem,
the,
I think you're having right now</v>

1114
01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:38.470
is that your personality is not allowing you to enjoy this moment.

1115
01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:43.720
Um,
I think the problem is your personality doesn't respect other people's

1116
01:13:43.721 --> 01:13:48.220
personalities.
And preferences.
Dude.
Shit in the mouth.

1117
01:13:49.450 --> 01:13:52.280
And how many girls did it?
I mean they got three on camera.

1118
01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:57.910
Who liked vomit too.
That's true.
Shit worse though.

1119
01:13:58.770 --> 01:14:03.650
I Dunno.
Wait a minute.
I don't know.
She had to know.
I think vomit for me worse.

1120
01:14:04.990 --> 01:14:08.980
So you have the option.
I'm going to shit on your lap or puke on your lap.

1121
01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:12.060
I would take the shit.
Really?
You know that I have such a

1122
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:14.170
<v 6>phobia.
Eye opening moment right now.</v>

1123
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.940
It's just no personalities got,
they're on grade level.

1124
01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:23.110
I have such a fear of vomiting.
I really don't like it.
I can't hear it.

1125
01:14:23.111 --> 01:14:27.970
I can't smell it as you can't do it all sometimes.
Yeah.
Yeah,
but shit,

1126
01:14:27.971 --> 01:14:32.230
I feel like every day I get shit on my hands changing diapers.
So it's like,

1127
01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:36.580
all right,
I'm knee deep in it.
It is horrible.
It is fucking,

1128
01:14:37.150 --> 01:14:40.540
yeah.
I mean hell,
Jay's puked on me.
I've smelled it.
It's not good.

1129
01:14:41.890 --> 01:14:46.390
So the Fucker,
what did they just say?
Ah,
yeah.

1130
01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:48.420
See How shitty your personality is and you would even know

1131
01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.920
<v 3>do something.
A lot of people would be like,
that guy's got a fun personality.</v>

1132
01:14:50.921 --> 01:14:54.000
He's having fun with that person.
Okay.
A lot of sociopath.

1133
01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:58.950
Like you know man,
a horrible are hilarious.

1134
01:14:59.010 --> 01:15:03.120
You want to spoil?
Yeah.
Let's see what you think.
So this is a,

1135
01:15:03.121 --> 01:15:06.830
I guess in the middle of a mouse taking place there.
Some shit.
My Mail

1136
01:15:10.810 --> 01:15:15.810
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>

1137
01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:23.830
Okay.

1138
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:28.100
<v 3>So what they did was they,
it's a Pr Japanese prank show.</v>

1139
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:32.750
So they'd set this guy up to go to a meeting and then they make it look like a

1140
01:15:32.751 --> 01:15:37.751
sniper across the whatever the way of crossing the building shoots the three

1141
01:15:39.351 --> 01:15:42.620
other people in the room.
The terrified the guy.
Right.

1142
01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:48.530
Well,
I didn't laugh.
Did you?
I seen this one.
Um,
oh,

1143
01:15:48.531 --> 01:15:51.410
you're smiling on the inside and I enjoyed it.
Yeah,

1144
01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:54.230
it's fun when you see them really scared.
Right.

1145
01:15:56.030 --> 01:16:00.440
That is the fun part,
right,
is when people are really scared.
Well,
but you know,

1146
01:16:00.441 --> 01:16:03.620
that was not imminent danger.
In other words,
it's not a real sniper.

1147
01:16:03.650 --> 01:16:05.810
Can I watch it again?
Knowing that now?
Yeah.
Can,

1148
01:16:05.910 --> 01:16:10.480
let's see if it reads and see if it's funny or to,
yeah,
yeah.
Okay.
Okay.

1149
01:16:10.490 --> 01:16:14.450
Let's see if I know the premise now.
Okay.
Yeah.
So here's the guy.

1150
01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:17.690
These are all actors and they have special effects and they're going to make it

1151
01:16:17.691 --> 01:16:20.390
seem like somebody shoots through the window.

1152
01:16:21.150 --> 01:16:21.983
<v 0>Cool.</v>

1153
01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:29.240
[inaudible] good.

1154
01:16:36.610 --> 01:16:40.840
<v 3>It's kind of too short of a clip to see the real terror right now you can watch</v>

1155
01:16:40.841 --> 01:16:44.290
these at length and see more,
you know.
See,
I have,

1156
01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:47.300
I have this pesky thing called empathy.
Yeah.

1157
01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:52.120
That doesn't allow me to like laugh when people are genuinely terrified.

1158
01:16:52.150 --> 01:16:55.720
Yeah.
I personally,
it's just a small problem.
Yeah.
Well,

1159
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:59.370
but it's also kind of like one of those none fun parts of your person.

1160
01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:05.930
<v 6>There's a lot of people.
Oh,
the empathy part please.</v>

1161
01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:10.260
Excuse you mean?
Oh,
the,
the excuse.
So you lol.

1162
01:17:11.690 --> 01:17:15.520
<v 3>I was on mute.
I wasn't really like hyperventilating,
laughing,
but I,</v>

1163
01:17:15.810 --> 01:17:17.330
I certainly had a couple of chuckles,

1164
01:17:17.790 --> 01:17:20.300
but you have to watch that at length because you can really see them panic.

1165
01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:23.600
Thank you.
That's a neat,
thank you for playing this really fun.

1166
01:17:23.850 --> 01:17:28.040
Also what I like is last night I go to bed before you,
I always do.

1167
01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:29.690
And you,
you go,

1168
01:17:29.691 --> 01:17:34.130
I got to watch my shows and of course I got to watch my show,

1169
01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:38.150
watch my shows and I go murder.
And you go,
yeah,
I go,
what part?

1170
01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:42.230
Why would you want to watch murder,

1171
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:45.920
killing sociopaths stuff right before bed you go,

1172
01:17:45.921 --> 01:17:49.490
it's going to affect your dreams for sure.
Is it going to affect your dreams?

1173
01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:52.310
It seeps into your unconscious mind.

1174
01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:58.100
Oh he's in a my mind cause I'm sleeping and I can hear all the stuff.

1175
01:17:58.101 --> 01:18:03.101
Like they found blood on Teresa's naked body or dismembered head found in the

1176
01:18:03.921 --> 01:18:06.920
court yard across the street in the apartment and like,

1177
01:18:06.921 --> 01:18:09.100
I don't want to hear this at all.
I mean it's a nice,

1178
01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:13.620
I think it's a nice way to kind of drift off into the Muslim there.

1179
01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:19.220
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean look,
most of the shows are all about solving.
Okay.

1180
01:18:19.610 --> 01:18:22.640
So that's,
that's what you're watching.
But yeah,
but no,

1181
01:18:22.641 --> 01:18:24.320
cause you like the shows where they're like,

1182
01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:28.850
and there hasn't been a crack in the case in 20 years.
But then,
I mean,

1183
01:18:28.851 --> 01:18:31.580
the one I watched last night,
they,
uh,
they,

1184
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:34.790
I watched them solve it and he liked the ones where it's the women.

1185
01:18:34.791 --> 01:18:39.180
It's always some cute 20 year old girl lives alone and she's abducted or raped

1186
01:18:39.190 --> 01:18:40.023
or murdered.

1187
01:18:40.510 --> 01:18:41.380
<v 5>Well,
I mean,
you can,</v>

1188
01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:45.100
it's kind of fun to picture yourself trying to commit the crime and then trying

1189
01:18:45.101 --> 01:18:47.200
to get away with it.
And then,
you know,

1190
01:18:47.201 --> 01:18:50.130
then you picture being the detective and you're sure you go,

1191
01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:52.240
how would I solve this?
But then you go,
oh,
what?

1192
01:18:52.241 --> 01:18:53.410
I want the guy to get away with it.

1193
01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:58.440
<v 3>Sure.
Yeah.
This is the fun part of your personality I was talking about,</v>

1194
01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.750
but really it was a really good,
uh,

1195
01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:04.170
it was a good murder case where they solved it.

1196
01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:08.650
Then the dominate the dummy wrote his name,
uh,

1197
01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:13.590
on her chalkboard.
He did.
Yeah.
His real name,
his real name,
he wrote,

1198
01:19:13.591 --> 01:19:17.490
Dennis was here.
And when they asked him about her,

1199
01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:21.210
<v 5>he was like,
no.
He was like,
I know she is,
but I've never been there.</v>

1200
01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:24.420
And then they go,
because this is on our chalkboard.
And he was like,
Oh,

1201
01:19:24.421 --> 01:19:28.710
you know what I did.
That's right.
I was in there and then,
and then he was like,

1202
01:19:28.711 --> 01:19:31.770
just running,
you know,
talking in circles.
And then he was like,
you know,

1203
01:19:31.771 --> 01:19:34.110
I actually witnessed the murder.
Okay,
so the guy do it.

1204
01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:38.190
<v 3>What a neat thing to have before bedtime.
Huh?
I still have like an angel.
Yeah,</v>

1205
01:19:38.230 --> 01:19:42.970
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I can't do it.
I can't watch that stuff before bed.
Why?

1206
01:19:42.971 --> 01:19:46.240
What happens?
Bad Dreams.
Negative dreams.

1207
01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:49.390
But you would just picture yourself solving a murder and then he got the title.

1208
01:19:49.391 --> 01:19:53.240
I like it.
I even have to ask you to turn it down about five times.
Well,

1209
01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:56.320
you asked me to turn everything down and you're getting worse with it used to be

1210
01:19:56.321 --> 01:20:01.170
fun and you used to go,
hey,
I like when you listen to the TV,
watch TV.
When I,

1211
01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:03.590
I'd be like,
great,
I'll watch a show now.

1212
01:20:03.970 --> 01:20:08.100
Every two minutes ago he turned it down a little bit and I go,
okay.

1213
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:11.600
<v 5>And then I turned it down.
It's like volumes,
single digit.
It's on set.</v>

1214
01:20:11.610 --> 01:20:15.780
And he tied down Lamar.
I go,
okay.
I can barely hear you

1215
01:20:18.170 --> 01:20:21.220
<v 6>homeless.
They still,
they still too loud.</v>

1216
01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:25.570
I'm trying to say why do I sound like a Hobo?
That's how you sound.

1217
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:28.780
You Go,
Eh,

1218
01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:32.880
trying to say it too loud.

1219
01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:35.700
<v 5>All right.
Like keep turning it down.</v>

1220
01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:39.420
<v 6>It's because I can't sleep because you want it.</v>

1221
01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:41.580
<v 5>Your bell tones out when you go to bed</v>

1222
01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:45.200
<v 6>because you watched dumb shit.</v>

1223
01:20:45.230 --> 01:20:49.160
My favorite thing you've been watching because it's football season or these

1224
01:20:49.190 --> 01:20:53.600
interviews they do when the team either wins or loses

1225
01:20:53.830 --> 01:20:58.830
<v 5>perspective on football coverage has completely opened a humor portal that I</v>

1226
01:21:01.631 --> 01:21:02.680
didn't know existed.

1227
01:21:02.710 --> 01:21:07.330
Like I didn't realize first you nailed it with the football songs.

1228
01:21:07.610 --> 01:21:08.443
Oh,
it's like

1229
01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:10.500
<v 6>fuck you guys ready to play</v>

1230
01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:17.740
and how does those pm Sunday night football songs are and now you pointed out to

1231
01:21:18.121 --> 01:21:20.070
me that,
what are the interviews like?

1232
01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:25.090
Well the interviews are stupid because if the team loses and what they do is

1233
01:21:25.831 --> 01:21:29.430
they carved out the poor son of a bitch who played his heart out and lost and

1234
01:21:29.431 --> 01:21:32.440
now he's completely destroyed.
He's teased.

1235
01:21:32.441 --> 01:21:36.520
He just wants to be alone and drink or do whatever.
And they're like,
what?

1236
01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:38.280
What happened out there?
And he's like,

1237
01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:41.970
well I didn't play as good as I thought I could.
And then we lost.

1238
01:21:42.210 --> 01:21:44.670
That's all they fucking say it over and over.
Well,

1239
01:21:44.671 --> 01:21:47.460
I mean I didn't do it as good as I could as well as I could have.

1240
01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:52.590
And then if they win,
well you guys won.
How did you win?
Well,
we practiced a lot.

1241
01:21:52.591 --> 01:21:56.730
And that's what made us win the game.
Well through,
there's all,

1242
01:21:56.850 --> 01:21:58.960
it's the same shit.
Yeah.

1243
01:21:59.850 --> 01:22:04.110
And then we practice a lot and then we won practice real good.

1244
01:22:04.111 --> 01:22:08.360
And then the winning happens.
Well how are you even worse?

1245
01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:10.490
We didn't practice so good.
And then

1246
01:22:12.210 --> 01:22:16.140
of course they won because they prepared better and they fucking won.

1247
01:22:16.141 --> 01:22:19.410
And the guy who lost the,
you know,
he feels like shit,
let him let him be alone.

1248
01:22:19.470 --> 01:22:23.520
Let him be alone.
Don't card them out.
But I don't know.

1249
01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:27.450
I get so fucking bored.
And the worst are when they try to make jokes,

1250
01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:31.650
they do the playbacks and then,
cause I don't understand the context.

1251
01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:35.580
All I hear a home,
that's how that guy does that.
And then they're like,

1252
01:22:35.581 --> 01:22:36.414
why are you

1253
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:43.190
the sports center?
They need better writers.
They have have

1254
01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:46.330
<v 5>a few genuinely funny guys.
Like if you,</v>

1255
01:22:46.331 --> 01:22:50.440
if you look at the lineup of the commentators,
there's probably,

1256
01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:55.120
I would say five or six genuinely really funny guys.
Problem is,

1257
01:22:55.630 --> 01:22:57.340
it's like any other hang it.

1258
01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:02.360
They pepper them with not funny guys who then try to compete with the really

1259
01:23:02.441 --> 01:23:06.040
funny guy.
And that's,
that's the real problem because there's some real funny

1260
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.930
<v 3>dudes.
Yeah.
And then there'll be,
you know,</v>

1261
01:23:07.931 --> 01:23:12.010
then they'll hire like just a straight up game analysts guy who was like,

1262
01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:15.510
oh my God.
And he'll start throwing in his like his dad jokes.

1263
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:19.970
<v 6>Not only that,
a lot of these guys are not kick.</v>

1264
01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:25.700
That guy's on the panel
and it's always at his own shit.

1265
01:23:25.730 --> 01:23:28.890
Those guys are always at their own.
Horrible.
Yeah.

1266
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:34.030
And then another thing that really chaps my ass is how unattractive 98% of those

1267
01:23:34.821 --> 01:23:36.800
dudes are on these fucking panel shows.

1268
01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:42.710
The women like these fucking basset hounds are on TV to crap.
It

1269
01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:45.310
<v 3>hold that dog sleeping on that heaven pillow.</v>

1270
01:23:46.530 --> 01:23:49.510
If beef loves people pillow,
it might be blue band here or something.
Right?

1271
01:23:49.850 --> 01:23:53.920
Blue Band.
Maybe you think he's here?
Maybe no.

1272
01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:58.330
To pick.
Yeah.
Maybe here to pick up these cards.
No,
you don't think so.

1273
01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:03.400
She just barks.
But she barks at the sky.
She barks in nothing.
No,
no,
no,

1274
01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:06.860
no.
He would be at the window.
Um,

1275
01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:12.800
what was I talking about?
How ugly these fucking dudes are.
It's true.
God,

1276
01:24:12.801 --> 01:24:13.990
you also pointed that out to me.

1277
01:24:13.991 --> 01:24:16.660
Something I'd never considered it because I don't think about how good looking

1278
01:24:16.661 --> 01:24:18.610
at guys.
But then you started to be like,

1279
01:24:18.611 --> 01:24:22.540
they let this fucking guy on television started to look at them and be like,

1280
01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:24.930
Oh yeah,
that guy doesn't look like he should be.

1281
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:28.010
<v 6>No.
And if you look at the sports casters that are female,</v>

1282
01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:31.670
the ones even down on the field,
they are fucking tendrils in their hair.

1283
01:24:31.671 --> 01:24:34.400
Perfect makeup.
It's blizzard outside.
And she's like,

1284
01:24:34.401 --> 01:24:38.270
how do you think that the thing went today?
And she looks amazing.

1285
01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:43.010
<v 3>There's only like three or four dogs that are women that are really,
yes,</v>

1286
01:24:43.410 --> 01:24:45.840
there's a couple real fucking hounds,
but,

1287
01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:49.800
but are they like actual athletes or former APP sometimes or they're just,

1288
01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:53.400
they're actually good.
No,
some of them are just actually good at the job.

1289
01:24:53.530 --> 01:24:56.750
You know,
like they're still good at that job that are actually good.

1290
01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:59.240
There's a few that need to get the boot,
but there's,
um,

1291
01:24:59.430 --> 01:25:02.910
but there's definitely like some,
some that you go,

1292
01:25:04.050 --> 01:25:05.130
she's just attractive.

1293
01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:11.160
<v 6>The hot chick that has no business.
I just love,
I've always loved sports.</v>

1294
01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:17.130
The gender trader.
Well,
I do say that because there is such a double standard.

1295
01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:20.730
I mean,
Jesus Christ and if fuck,
it's ridiculous.

1296
01:25:21.630 --> 01:25:25.200
Well thank God I don't watch football so I just have to hear it when I'm falling

1297
01:25:25.201 --> 01:25:29.880
asleep.
You want to explore for a moment the pup training again?
Oh my God.

1298
01:25:29.881 --> 01:25:33.120
I've been waiting for pub training.
Can I urinate first?
You want to urinate?

1299
01:25:33.170 --> 01:25:35.730
I had been drinking so much water.
I'm so hydrated.

1300
01:25:36.050 --> 01:25:41.000
<v 3>He really quick.
So press pause.
Okay.
One moment.
Okay,</v>

1301
01:25:41.410 --> 01:25:42.150
we're rolling.
How was it?

1302
01:25:42.150 --> 01:25:45.700
<v 6>Did you break?
It was good.
I pushed hard and it all came out.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

1303
01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:47.730
I've been waiting all week for these clips,

1304
01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:50.550
<v 3>uh,
well to um,</v>

1305
01:25:50.810 --> 01:25:53.480
kind of get people,

1306
01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:58.940
remind people of what would you forget if you listen to the last episode,

1307
01:25:59.490 --> 01:26:01.380
because I think some people might have been like,
well what was that?

1308
01:26:01.381 --> 01:26:05.630
And so in three 71 a month or two ago,
whatever that was,

1309
01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:10.640
we introduced you to pup play in a very accessible,

1310
01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:13.580
nonthreatening way,
you know,
and nonsexual,

1311
01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:18.230
you know,
it's just,

1312
01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:21.260
<v 12>that's what
I feel.</v>

1313
01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:25.170
I feel like I have to live two lives in some ways

1314
01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:29.960
it's just guys quit crop

1315
01:26:31.630 --> 01:26:34.430
the sexy times when Fox,
not the whole awesome

1316
01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:41.640
<v 3>just being dog.
That's not the whole essence of it,
Tom.
Absolutely.</v>

1317
01:26:41.710 --> 01:26:46.000
<v 12>No,
it's just pups here today for training too,
to test their skills.</v>

1318
01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:49.300
So show me a kneel position.

1319
01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:53.290
<v 3>There you go.
See now why can't,</v>

1320
01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:58.560
my question is what's wrong with three or four guys getting together in a room

1321
01:26:58.901 --> 01:27:02.320
with a cage wearing latex and dog masks?

1322
01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:05.200
There's certainly nothing wrong with that.

1323
01:27:05.201 --> 01:27:08.680
I think what's also good about nothing being wrong with it.
It's also,

1324
01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:11.610
it's just a hang,
you know,
there's,
and there's,

1325
01:27:11.611 --> 01:27:16.300
there's nothing misleading about this obviously well produced segment.

1326
01:27:16.301 --> 01:27:17.560
I mean it looks good.
It sounds

1327
01:27:17.590 --> 01:27:21.800
<v 12>good.
We sent that.
He's Seiko that belongs to somebody in the room.
Well done.</v>

1328
01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:24.880
Well done.
Well done.

1329
01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:29.630
<v 3>Well done.
He was just sniffing those boxers on the floor,
but that's,
I mean,</v>

1330
01:27:29.631 --> 01:27:34.240
who doesn't sniff dirty boxers?
What's interesting is the guy here,

1331
01:27:34.270 --> 01:27:39.150
the trainer gets into the fact that he's also a pioneer.
Right.

1332
01:27:39.890 --> 01:27:44.180
<v 12>There wasn't any other trainers.
There wasn't anyone to teach me.
No,</v>

1333
01:27:44.190 --> 01:27:49.140
he's doing it.
I had to go at him,
learn and put together the ideas.
Wow.

1334
01:27:50.460 --> 01:27:53.550
Wow.
What are some of the ideas?
An innovator.

1335
01:27:53.830 --> 01:27:57.600
I happen to have a clip of some of the training time during your work day or

1336
01:27:57.820 --> 01:27:59.520
during those moments when you're in class.

1337
01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:02.813
<v 7>Okay.</v>

1338
01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:07.920
<v 12>You want to go here?
Would your hand down your pants,</v>

1339
01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:13.200
grab your nuts,
have a feel?
Okay.
Could you fingers over them?

1340
01:28:13.410 --> 01:28:14.243
Right.

1341
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:17.263
<v 7>Bring them up.</v>

1342
01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:21.270
<v 12>Yeah.
It's so amazing.
You know,
it was fun.</v>

1343
01:28:21.271 --> 01:28:25.620
It wasn't any other parts and stuff and philosophy.
Oh,

1344
01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:29.760
and also from kinesthetics and safe with psychology and putting that all

1345
01:28:29.761 --> 01:28:31.830
together.
I've become a trainer

1346
01:28:33.630 --> 01:28:38.220
and I own pups.
Who are you backing it again?
Notice that.

1347
01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:43.200
Here's your honor.
Our own dogs barked during.
This truly is a dog trainer.

1348
01:28:43.201 --> 01:28:47.300
He's like,
I'm a no.
What's your ducts smell like at different times of the day?

1349
01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:51.260
In the morning when you wake up,
have a phone,
have a phone door.

1350
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:56.240
Oh my God.
If you're nuts now,
thanks.
Take a smell.

1351
01:28:56.990 --> 01:29:01.290
<v 3>A woman in America hasn't seen that.
Every morning emails came in.</v>

1352
01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:04.500
You know?
I think when we originally aired the clip,

1353
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.940
some of them said it was British and we were like,
and then,

1354
01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:11.160
and then we got a bunch of emails saying,
this guy's not key.
We at all.

1355
01:29:11.170 --> 01:29:14.910
It does Australian.
Oh for fuck sake.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.

1356
01:29:14.911 --> 01:29:19.230
Well Australian or Kiwi,
it's how bad it is.
What?
It doesn't matter.

1357

1361
01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:29.480
you don't want to come back with shit on your finger.

Yeah.
I don't feel like you need to play a few loads of calm.
Yeah.
Oh,

You know,

1391
01:31:18.341 --> 01:31:22.410

1392
01:31:24.010 --> 01:31:28.910

Tom,
if he,

1393
01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:31.560
can you do something for me?
If you have a minute today and then he'd be like,

1394
01:31:31.561 --> 01:31:35.970
what if like you put your hands down your pants and just take a sniff or your

1395
01:31:35.971 --> 01:31:39.480
cock and balls.
It was fun.
It was fun.
Yeah.

1396
01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:43.530
Because you fell for it a few times,
which is super great.
I'm like,
Tommy,

1397
01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:45.330
can you do me a favor?
And you're like,

1398
01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:49.330
<v 12>Burn?
What's your raw smells like?
Yeah.</v>

1399
01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:53.340
<v 3>Yeah,
man.
That's so good.
Yeah.</v>

1400
01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:58.500
How do you think how this is?
See even this one I can understand.
Yeah.

1401
01:31:58.830 --> 01:32:01.980
This one I get,
I love dogs.
I understand that.
Yeah.

1402
01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:06.860
I don't understand getting shit in your mouth.
I think that's gnarly.
Yeah,
that's,

1403
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:11.230
that's,
that's pretty wild.
I don't want to smell another guy's ass.
Right?

1404
01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:15.100
Hm.
When you say you don't want to,
what do you mean though?

1405
01:32:16.150 --> 01:32:20.020
I don't know.
Yeah.
How much for you to do this?

1406
01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:25.090
Oh,
um,
I mean to my own,
I've definitely,

1407
01:32:25.091 --> 01:32:26.320
everyone's smelled their own.

1408
01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:30.210
Know how much for you to take training to go to New Zealand or Australia,

1409
01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:33.340
wherever this is.
Yeah.
Sign up for pop class.

1410
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:38.260
I want you in full lay techs outfit.
This guy would abuse me though.
This guy is,

1411
01:32:38.261 --> 01:32:41.990
this guy is one of those guys just like,
just like some guys do it with chicks.

1412
01:32:41.991 --> 01:32:43.690
Did the,
it's their angle.
He's like,

1413
01:32:43.691 --> 01:32:47.980
I'm pump training you and then he fucking locks you in a cage and sticks it in

1414
01:32:47.981 --> 01:32:51.850
your butt.
You know how,
okay,
so you're either in pub training,
would you rather,

1415
01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:54.090
yeah.
You're doing full pub training,

1416
01:32:54.190 --> 01:32:57.100
<v 12>right?
Run your finger along incorrect.
If you Ross,</v>

1417
01:32:57.700 --> 01:32:58.930
you don't need to figure your home.

1418
01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:00.710
You don't want to come back with shit on your finger.

1419
01:33:00.850 --> 01:33:03.040
<v 3>You don't need to finger your whole,
I like how he,</v>

1420
01:33:03.041 --> 01:33:04.780
he just makes that distinction.
Yes.
Yes.

1421
01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:07.510
<v 12>Don't sneeze to different parts of your underwear.</v>

1422
01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:11.350
<v 3>Yeah.
Go ahead and sniff.
Sniff,
sniff it.</v>

1423
01:33:11.450 --> 01:33:13.590
The different parts of your underwear.
So,

1424
01:33:13.591 --> 01:33:18.460
but do you have to sniff another guys is just get a quarterly happens.
Yeah,

1425
01:33:18.461 --> 01:33:20.160
we saw them training.

1426
01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:26.060
So you go to pub training or horrible or are you stay with all McAfee in police

1427
01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:31.140
training and you do how many training?
Well,
I'm shitting in his mouth.
You got it.

1428
01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:36.180
No problem.
You're shutting in McAfee's mouth.
Yeah.
Every morning you wake up,

1429
01:33:36.570 --> 01:33:41.320
you have your coffee and when you feel it,
Bruin,
I feel bad for McAfee.

1430
01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:46.080
Of course.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean there's,
there's,
it's not going to be nice.

1431
01:33:46.170 --> 01:33:50.670
Yours are terrible.
Terrible.
But the mean,
it's still,
it's shit.
But yeah,

1432
01:33:50.671 --> 01:33:54.070
without question,
this over pub training.
Oh,

1433
01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:59.510
now what if you're the one who's getting shit in your mouth?
There's no question.

1434
01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:02.730
There's definitely,
that's not happening.
What?
So you would rather do,

1435
01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:05.760
you would rather have those prostitutes should in your mouth and do pub pub

1436
01:34:05.761 --> 01:34:10.160
training.
I mean,
you're a McAfee or pub training baby.

1437
01:34:10.161 --> 01:34:13.980
It's just simple.
I just,
uh,
this is really upsetting right now.

1438
01:34:14.010 --> 01:34:16.140
You have to pick one.
It's the fucking rolls.

1439
01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:18.540
It's would you rather so you have to pick one.

1440
01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:22.713
<v 9>MMM.</v>

1441
01:34:24.530 --> 01:34:28.550
<v 3>I guess I'll be up fucking pop.
I guess I'm puffing pop.
No</v>

1442
01:34:30.530 --> 01:34:35.360
pop training.
Yeah.
To sniff your masters.
Good photo of your nuts.
God.

1443
01:34:36.110 --> 01:34:40.940
Width of your Masters Groin.
Don't put your finger in your ass.

1444
01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:47.180
You don't,
you don't have to put it in there.
Yeah,
I know.
I love her.

1445
01:34:47.181 --> 01:34:50.150
It's like if you have some time in your day,
just unlace your leather pants.

1446
01:34:50.151 --> 01:34:52.110
This is good to another cubicle.
I don't know if he knows his,

1447
01:34:52.111 --> 01:34:54.200
but cubicles are wide open.
Yeah.

1448
01:34:54.650 --> 01:34:58.820
Stick your hand in there and then and just during day.
Yeah.

1449
01:34:59.810 --> 01:35:03.620
You have a free moment because you have to get to know your scent.
Right.

1450
01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:07.670
Strengthen your son Ray,
build your mosque.
I think this guy's terrifying.

1451
01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:08.970
Terrifying.
Yeah.

1452
01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:13.790
Well because it's that mild mannered horse shit and I know this is just called

1453
01:35:13.791 --> 01:35:14.870
pup play.
It's a little thing

1454
01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:20.490
and then the next thing you know he's telling you not to finger your ass hole.

1455
01:35:20.491 --> 01:35:23.300
Just smelled the sweaty crag.
Stark

1456
01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:28.580
<v 14>smells like coconut balls.
Smell like,
yeah,</v>

1457
01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:29.431
<v 3>we know.</v>

1458
01:35:29.431 --> 01:35:32.100
Everybody knows what they're going through and knows that drill because everyone

1459
01:35:32.101 --> 01:35:36.210
is checked underwear.
Of course he goes,
oh yeah,
that's bad on you smell,

1460
01:35:36.211 --> 01:35:38.880
but you smell yourself all the time.
I don't.
I don't need to.

1461
01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:43.440
Now I am going to go the workout right now when I'm done I'm going to let you

1462
01:35:43.441 --> 01:35:46.710
sniff it.
Well,
you save the panties for pup training.

1463
01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:51.780
Now you have to ejaculate into one part of the panel.
Yeah,

1464
01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:53.880
loads,
loads,

1465
01:35:53.881 --> 01:35:57.750
loads the same pair just over and I'm sure guys do that all the time.

1466
01:35:57.780 --> 01:36:00.510
I'm sure of it,
but I'm sure it his or particularly gnarly.

1467
01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:04.410
Maybe that's how he gets people like Christmas gifts for him or just his used

1468
01:36:04.411 --> 01:36:05.970
underwear and he's like,
I got you something nice.

1469
01:36:06.570 --> 01:36:09.600
That's a nice part about having this fetish isn't it?
It's Kinda Nice.

1470
01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:14.340
Kinda easy that way.
Alright.
Farts effective.
Uh,
hold on.

1471
01:36:14.341 --> 01:36:16.950
Say thank you to Megan and Megan.
Oh my God.

1472
01:36:17.190 --> 01:36:21.900
Thank you Megan and Megan for the unbelievable Valentine's Day cards.

1473
01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:26.990
I think we should save them and like read them closer to Valentine's Day and

1474
01:36:26.991 --> 01:36:27.780
this is,

1475
01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:31.950
we should mention the third edition that Megan and they're impressive have given

1476
01:36:31.951 --> 01:36:34.830
us.
I really enjoyed them.
These two women,

1477
01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:38.670
they make these valentime's uh,
just it relative to the shell.

1478
01:36:38.671 --> 01:36:42.990
They're all different.
Beer mom shows themed and it's really funny,
man.

1479
01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:45.840
I'm so excited to go through them.
I haven't had a chance.

1480
01:36:45.841 --> 01:36:50.400
Do you want to hear the big words or just like,
oh,

1481
01:36:50.401 --> 01:36:52.750
just like the gays.
Okay.
I liked that clip a lot.

1482
01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:57.210
Just like the gays who made this leg the gate.

1483
01:36:57.570 --> 01:37:01.050
Would you ever want to date your mouth?
Uh,
DJ boy butter.
I said,

1484
01:37:01.051 --> 01:37:04.080
I really would thank you for listening to the show.

1485
01:37:04.081 --> 01:37:07.990
Don't forget your mom's house,

deep bro.
I talk about Cameron Dallas this week.

1487
01:37:12.361 --> 01:37:14.550
I don't know if you've seen that kid on Netflix.

1488
01:37:14.551 --> 01:37:18.420
He's a social media star and I feel,
Oh,

1489
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:22.860
I talk about discipline and your discipline for losing weight.
Yeah,
it was good.

1490
01:37:22.861 --> 01:37:24.390
And stuff like that.
Take emails.

1491

This guy says he's a sociopath and he's a 30 year old virgin and he wants to

1492
01:37:29.551 --> 01:37:32.700
know how to get laid.
So that's on this week's episode of that steep pro.

1493
01:37:32.701 --> 01:37:37.530
Check it out.
God Damn.
Alright,
thanks guys.
We love you my jeans.

1494
01:37:38.810 --> 01:37:43.750
<v 14>You're my son.
I'm your mom.
You're my son.</v>

1495
01:37:44.810 --> 01:37:49.790
I'm your mom.
Pass.
And when you asked him,
when you get your mom,

1496
01:37:54.810 --> 01:37:55.643
you're son,

1497
01:37:56.820 --> 01:38:00.350
<v 15>I'm your mom did just like the gate.
It just like,</v>

1498
01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:05.820
just like the gate.
I looked at her and she looked at me

1499
01:38:09.980 --> 01:38:14.810
like the gate
once my wife calls me,
mom,
you,
I mean

1500
01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:17.730
both consenting adults.

1501
01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:22.320
Ask him when you asked him.

1502
01:38:22.321 --> 01:38:25.600
When I looked at her and she looked at me,

1503
01:38:25.610 --> 01:38:30.540
and you're my son,
I'm your mom.
Because like the gate,

1504
01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:34.580
just like,
just like the gate,

1505
01:38:37.850 --> 01:38:42.030
ask them,
will you pass pass,
pass if just like the gate.
