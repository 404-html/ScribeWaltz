00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:01.930

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.400
<v 1>all over my vagina.</v>

5
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.913
I will

6
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.360
turn around and go
talk to me like,
you know

7
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.150
what,
we

8
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.350
don't want it going down.
My leg went

9
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.940
on board with drop box

10
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.750
<v 0>securities on the way now.</v>

11
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.100
<v 3>No,
it's just a lading honor period saying,
fuck yeah,
you're kids don't know that.</v>

12
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.700
<v 0>Have you ever had a,</v>

13
00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:22.760
you were saying somebody kicked out that was from last week's episode later was

14
00:02:22.761 --> 00:02:25.130
really losing her mind,
bleeding out of her vagina on the plane.

15
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.960
You ever seen someone lose their mind on the plane?

16
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.860
<v 3>Hmm.
I,
I feel like the answer's yes,</v>

17
00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:35.320
but I can't recall.
I feel like I've seen it all on planes.
Right,
right.
Yeah,

18
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.270
for sure.
Yeah.
You have you seen one?

19
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.100
<v 0>Yeah,
I saw,
I've seen a couple people get accosted by the,
uh,</v>

20
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.270
flight attendants and I've,
I've seen,
uh,
somebody,
um,
I've,
I've,

21
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.940
I've returned to the gate before I had someone thrown off the plane.

22
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.440
<v 3>Wow.
Yeah.
Wow.</v>

23
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.200
<v 0>Well,
I learned later,
uh,
I think I've told the story,
but,
um,</v>

24
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.990
this was a lady on small,
like a regional flight and she,

25
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.820
I guess she kind of was short with the flight attendant,
uh,

26
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.050
right before we were going to take off.

27
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.590
And the flight attendant then told the pilot and I was like,
no.

28
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.060
So we went all the way back to the gate and as they were s getting her off the

29
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:18.320
plane is when she was a really flipping out.
Yeah.

30
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.250
Because when she learned that she wasn't going to make the flight,
yeah.

31
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.170
She lost her mind.
You know,

32
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:26.260
cause they had to police waiting for it and everything.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow.

33
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.110
Cause some flight attendants don't play it off.
I did one,

34
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.110
I was on a flight this year where,

35
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.590
so this is the weirdest thing I was in first of course,

36
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:39.770
like I'm not a piece of shit.
And a guy,
um,

37
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.900
was hanging out in the galley and I heard the flight attendant go,

38
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:46.720
I've told you to go back to your seat.

39
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.190
And the guy who was an older guy,
he was like,

40
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.760
I want to stand here.
I can't and he's like,
you can't stand here,

41
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.990
you have to go back.
And then somebody in first that he knew,

42
00:03:59.991 --> 00:04:02.770
it was like the guy,
the older guy goes,

43
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.030
he said I could have his seat.
And he goes,
you can't.

44
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.730
And he goes,
why?
He goes,
because I said,

45
00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:13.630
so you don't get to decide that hey got heated.

46
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.320
Then they had a pilot come out this,
this is already,
this is mid air though.

47
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.580
This is during the flight.
And the pilot was like,
you have to obey this guy.

48
00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:25.380
You have to go to your seat.
And the guy kept hanging out.
Yeah.

49
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.290
It was against define it and I was like,
this mother fucker is going to cause us

50
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.300
<v 4>Delania land.
Don't you think that's enough?
Like I,</v>

51
00:04:32.301 --> 00:04:36.770
I'm so I'm afraid of of that kind of authority.

52
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.570
Like when,
when there's no exit for you,
like you're on that plane bro.
You're,

53
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.600
you're under their mercy.
Like just follow the rules.
Dip Shit.
He was like,

54
00:04:44.601 --> 00:04:49.520
my back hurts.
Don't,
don't take the flight.
Yeah.
He was like,

55
00:04:49.521 --> 00:04:53.990
get the fuck back there.
But can you imagine like I,
you know,

56
00:04:53.991 --> 00:04:57.140
I've talked to my fair share of shit on a flight attendant should want to talk

57
00:04:57.141 --> 00:05:01.850
some shit but real talk,
that's gotta be a such a hard job.

58
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.950
I mean you're dealing with,
yeah,
of course.

59
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.490
The general public who can't seem to figure out simple shit,

60
00:05:07.491 --> 00:05:12.170
like put a fucking bag under the seat in front of you or put it up there or can,

61
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.530
you know,
consolidate your goods,
things like that.
You know,

62
00:05:15.531 --> 00:05:16.970
people are dumb as fuck.

63
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.730
<v 0>One time I was boarding and I stopped to help a lady,</v>

64
00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:26.020
like an older lady put her bag up and a girl,

65
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.480
a woman behind me goes,
are you kidding me right now?

66
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.230
And I turned around help somebody cause I,
cause I was stopped.
Oh God.

67
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.130
I turned around and I go,
what?
And she was like,
I go,

68
00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:38.560
I'm helping her put her back.
She's like,
all right,
but come on man.

69
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.470
This was like as as I'm boarding the flight.

70
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.840
<v 4>Yeah.
I'd probably say something like that to somebody.
Really.
Yeah.
It's crazy.</v>

71
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.140
It is crazy.
It,
especially if it's like an early morning flight.

72
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.890
Sometimes I'm real grumpy and I might,
I might say things,

73
00:05:52.891 --> 00:05:55.760
I don't know if I actually say them out loud,
but I say them in my head.
Yeah.

74
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.190
Does that count?
No,
no.

75
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.220
<v 5>You can say all kinds of things.
I don't think I've actually said out loud,</v>

76
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:04.980
but I've definitely thought it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

77
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.450
But then that's why I have so much respect and admiration for the period lady.

78
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.900
Cause like I've,
I've had thoughts like that,
but for someone to just say it,

79
00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:14.330
I really respect that.
I really admire it.

80
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.860
The fact that it was like losing her mind.
Yeah.

81
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.460
Talking about bleeding out of her fat and everything and that level of

82
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:23.660
obsessiveness is like you're at the break.
Yeah.
And I've been there emotionally.

83
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:27.320
I just have never let the dam burst like that.
But yeah,
I feel like I,
you know,

84
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.700
I get it.
I respect a bit.
You can.
Good for you.

85
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.540
I respected the guy who was trying to cover his face and correct.
Yeah.

86
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.400
That's identified with that guy.
So it's like,
oh man.

87
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.000
And then his laughing too because he was cringing and then shaking.
Laughing.

88
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.960
Yeah.
I felt like I was,
that guy took good time that that one you have to see.

89
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.310
But that guy,
that guy is me.
Yeah,
for sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,

90
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.840
should we play our or show open here?
Do this correctly.
Let's do it,
man.

91
00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.093
Let's do it.

92
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.820
<v 6>Well,
come beautiful beings.</v>

93
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.180
We talked before this video is how to activate your lingam upon those who don't

94
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:12.470
know the word Lingam is relating to the genitals and male genital area.

95
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.950
And you know another way of putting it within this video would be how to

96
00:07:17.961 --> 00:07:19.700
activate your cook power.

97
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.510
<v 2>Oh was Randy.
Don't bring in one.
Love it.
Fucking scumbag.</v>

98
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.800
Well go to your mom's house,

99
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.870
Christina pushes.
It's increasing.

100
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.850
These guys are the same.
They're all the same.
That's where I get my favorite.

101
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.160
I mean you can always identify them by their stupid jewelry.
Yeah,

102
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.940
yeah.
The arm part of the front of the brand,

103
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.660
<v 5>right?
Yeah.
Right,
right.
Yeah.
Don't you feel like that's the,</v>

104
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.810
that's how you can identify a Douche bag like this.
It does.

105
00:08:15.811 --> 00:08:20.430
He have a thumb rate and our man paint on his forehead.
Good damage.

106
00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.100
Cause that other guy,
the Indian guy remember the,
uh,

107
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:28.160
the finger into girls at the same time and how to hug twin activation.

108
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.790
Yeah.
Got us to an activation.
Yeah.
This fucking guy.
Yeah,

109
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.410
he's got it.
He,
yeah,
he's got his third I highlighted.
Yeah.

110
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:42.800
And then it's always like the Robie necklace with some bullshit thing on it.

111
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.240
You know how to activate your cock power.

112
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.880
I have a few ways that I can activate mine.
I don't know if I need a lesson,

113
00:08:50.881 --> 00:08:54.030
but let's see what we can learn from my guys.
Know that right.

114
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:58.800
Of course are year old knows that this is just a lane to get your cock into

115
00:08:58.801 --> 00:09:00.420
someone else.
Yeah.

116
00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:06.570
<v 6>The whole idea here as men to realize that your genital area,</v>

117
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:12.340
your lingo is a very sacred place.

118
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.140
<v 5>We know that.
Why we all know that.
And then I,
you know,</v>

119
00:09:15.141 --> 00:09:19.220
do I have to point out the obvious critique here?
What is that?

120
00:09:19.221 --> 00:09:23.180
It's a white guy talking like a Rastafarian dude,

121
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.470
please French.
Are you sure?
Definitely.
Oh,
I'm sorry.

122
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.160
I heard Rosta I thought he was pretending to be like a Jamaican Bro.
Please.

123
00:09:31.161 --> 00:09:35.350
I'm the master of fucking like I tell them this whole time,
I was like,
oh,

124
00:09:35.351 --> 00:09:37.460
okay man.
I swear I hear that.
I,

125
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:41.840
I thought I heard Rosta he might be living there,

126
00:09:41.841 --> 00:09:45.610
but he's definitely French.
Wow.
This dude's first language is French.
Yeah,

127
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:49.340
that makes sense now cause I was like this mother fucker pretend like he

128
00:09:49.341 --> 00:09:54.220
Jamaican or some shit.
Motherfucker.
You went to makings man.
Um,

129
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.240
<v 6>have a good relationship with your,</v>

130
00:09:57.241 --> 00:10:02.220
your lingo lead to becoming using is like the pleasure Jimmy.
Pleasure.

131
00:10:02.221 --> 00:10:07.170
You know,
it's very demanding.
It's very rough in the approach.
Yeah.

132
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.180
And let me guess.

133
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.600
<v 5>We should have someone else kind of take care of it for us.</v>

134
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.150
What w what should we do with it?
I don't know,

135
00:10:15.151 --> 00:10:17.640
but I wish he'd put his fucking arm down.
I can't stand that.

136
00:10:17.641 --> 00:10:21.040
He's doing a video hanging one arm.
I was really strapped.

137
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.700
I don't want to see his fucking smelly armpit.

138
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.850
I want to see a stupid fucking gold band.
Dirty fucking frog.
But John Are Debbie.

139
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:28.360
Yeah.

140
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.760
<v 6>And one of the core practices that you can bring into your life.</v>

141
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:33.970
It's a practice of self love.

142
00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:39.930
Touching yourself and activating your whole genital area through a self

143
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.830
nurturing massage.
Picnics.

144
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.053
<v 5>I mean,</v>

145
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:51.410
so far the distinction that's been made is that a lot of us are too rough with

146
00:10:51.411 --> 00:10:54.770
our dicks and he's like,
you should be nicer to it and be nice and you're a dick.

147
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:57.260
That's the lesson so far.
Right.
And again,
I don't,

148
00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.120
I don't think you need to teach men.

149
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:05.200
It seems pretty innate because our son who's a year old is ferociously attacking

150
00:11:05.751 --> 00:11:08.640
his penis and that he didn't need us to tell him no.
That,

151
00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.480
that sounds like a rough,
what's wrong with that?
What are the guy goes,

152
00:11:11.481 --> 00:11:15.940
I don't like to do nice touches.
I like rough.
That's founded like the Super Gay,

153
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:20.100
like the,
uh,
what,
what about the,
the wham video though?

154
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.200
That's not a soft touch.
That's a very rough,

155
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.090
she power cleans him from the floor by the falls.

156
00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.700
But do budget or bug,
that's the best

157
00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.130
for those of you.

158
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.160
It's on our Twitter feeds or you have to search back a little ways.

159
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.750
No bits there and um,
yeah,
it,
it's out there guys.
It's on my Twitter feed.

160
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.420
<v 6>How can I get my Lingam to be my friend?
And uh,</v>

161
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.520
so this is very different than masturbation.

162
00:11:50.521 --> 00:11:55.210
It's very different than wanting to go for ejaculation watching porn.
You know,

163
00:11:55.211 --> 00:11:59.010
that's tough.
We're talking about giving your cock,

164
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.560
your Lingam love some real love.

165
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.710
<v 4>That's all this fucking nonsense.
Those are all his,
uh,
lesson plans.</v>

166
00:12:07.711 --> 00:12:11.160
I think all of his,
uh,
ancient Sanskrit bullshit.

167
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:15.510
He has drawings all over the wall and all this,

168
00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:20.310
you know,
when is this Kama Sutra?
Yeah.
Fuck swings.

169
00:12:20.311 --> 00:12:23.460
And now what's your guests though?
Let's say I go,
okay,
this guy,

170
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.620
you meet this guy,
you're on the beach.
Yeah.

171
00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:29.490
Do you think he knows how to show your good time?
At least this guy?
Yeah.

172
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.090
You know,
I have to tell you,
I'm sure he current load with a lot of women,

173
00:12:33.091 --> 00:12:37.530
but personally,
this kind of sensitive energy stuff,

174
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:41.460
it repels.
It just repels me.
But you don't think this guy knows how to eat a box?

175
00:12:41.461 --> 00:12:45.780
So I don't know,
man.
I think he's probably the,
I think it's too emotional for me.

176
00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:49.110
I think he wants to maintain eye contact while he does it.
Oh,
definitely.

177
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.480
100% that would make me so uncomfortable.

178
00:12:51.481 --> 00:12:55.710
And you're looking for more like of a sport.
Fuck right.
I'm not looking.

179
00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.510
That's what you're looking for.
I'm looking for a dude.

180
00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.530
I feel like this guy is not,
you want it more

181
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.440
<v 1>masculine,
his feminine energy.</v>

182
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.900
Not necessarily.
Not necessarily that.

183
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:17.250
<v 4>Yeah,
I just think he's a little too central.
It's too much.
Too many feelings.</v>

184
00:13:17.251 --> 00:13:18.810
I can't,
I can't handle feelings.

185
00:13:18.811 --> 00:13:23.490
You know that what you can't handle feeling like his two emo for me.

186
00:13:23.491 --> 00:13:26.720
He's way to email you say that he's going to start crying,

187
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.970
which I feel like he would,
he would cry and want to hold me a lot.
Mm.

188
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.880
And we'd have to talk about our feelings afterwards.
Shit.
Yeah.

189
00:13:35.881 --> 00:13:39.750
I don't want to cry after and hold each other.
All right.
So I'm saying I'm Karen.

190
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.460
You won't downtown and Trish.
I'm Karen.
Yeah.
Yeah.

191
00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.980
<v 6>So the way it works is very simple.
Just take some I such oils,</v>

192
00:13:46.981 --> 00:13:51.830
some coconut oil and start pouring it on your lingam and spend,
you know,
five,

193
00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:54.860
10 minutes,
half an hour,
just nurturing this area.

194
00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.310
<v 4>Could you even do that for five or 10 minutes or half and he jumped the half an</v>

195
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:03.610
hour with coconut oil.
What Nice touches.

196
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.880
How long do you think you would last massaging your Lingam for?

197
00:14:06.881 --> 00:14:09.460
With the coconut oil wouldn't be five to 10

198
00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:15.940
much faster
as I imagine most humans,

199
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:19.480
but he would tell me that's the problem.
You know,
always like,
give me pleasure.

200
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.980
Bye.
[inaudible].
Yeah,
that's true.

201
00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:29.340
<v 6>Soon as you start touching,
it's gone.
Listen to this star,</v>

202
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:33.140
a more nurturing and more healing and more loving.

203
00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:38.360
Then eventually what happens is that there is a massive expansion of this area

204
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.640
means that there is an energetic and emotional release that happens and shells

205
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:46.620
and your penis traumas there are being released and there is a,

206
00:14:46.621 --> 00:14:51.040
an energetic expansion.
If that happens,
all I would say,

207
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.390
it's not so much like you would notice that as soon as you start touching this

208
00:14:56.391 --> 00:14:59.420
area,
you will notice that there are movements that you can make.

209
00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.450
There's more wacky jewelry that are going to be how much jewelry,

210
00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.790
you know that's all going to come naturally.

211
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:09.270
Musical instrument and playing with it.
Same with your,

212
00:15:09.271 --> 00:15:11.900
your balls with your testicles,
you know your testicle area.

213
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:16.820
The same with the Perry name,
which is between,
uh,
the bees.
Okay,
man,
sister,

214
00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.050
I'm tapped out.

215
00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:22.480
Your inner Lorea spent plenty of time down there and then there was all the anal

216
00:15:22.481 --> 00:15:24.860
area as well that you can pay with that you can't really

217
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:31.820
base Chakra Area Chakra needs your love.
Yeah,
very smell.
Nice to do.

218
00:15:31.821 --> 00:15:36.500
Just that,
you know,
to start cultivating our relationship with that.
Thank you.

219
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.290
She's nurturing and loving.
Thank you.
Again,

220
00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:42.410
this isn't a very lucky because they already have the circles.

221
00:15:42.411 --> 00:15:46.250
They already high and magical.
The way they cultivate a love for the Yoni.

222
00:15:46.251 --> 00:15:47.350
They look at each other.

223
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.380
They work with mirrors about the anatomy stuff,

224
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:55.160
breast massage and all that stuff.
Guys who were a little bit behind.
Okay.

225
00:15:55.161 --> 00:15:58.910
It's time to catch up.
Catch up the stack,
bringing those techniques right.

226
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.700
<v 5>I have an idea,
Tom,
right?</v>

227
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.650
You've got a neat group of guy friends do this with them.

228
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.820
Why don't you invite them over and have a a lingam appreciation night.

229
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:09.290
Get a bunch of coconut oil,

230
00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:13.790
keeps it spent a good 30 minutes just massaging each other's balls.

231
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.760
Why each other's I think it's self love.
He was talking about,
oh sorry.

232
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:21.620
And then you can bring up the mirrors and just sit in a circle.
Right.
And uh,

233
00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:26.180
I mean Burt would obviously be on board.
Yeah.
A sickler.
Yeah.
Do it.
Yeah,

234
00:16:26.181 --> 00:16:29.370
he would do it.
Yeah,
definitely met full charge Matt.
Yeah.
Awesome.

235
00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.700
Who else could do it?
The,
as Joey Diaz was really on board with,

236
00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:39.800
what do you think he'd bring to the table?
Joe Probably wouldn't be on board.

237
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.053
I think it would be,

238
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.340
I think it would definitely bring in a new level of excitement to the situation.

239
00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:53.470
Uh,
you think Joe would want to do that?
Yeah,
definitely.
Yeah.
Yeah.

240
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.580
I was signed out.
The pleasure.
Yeah.

241
00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:03.980
Power.
Yeah.
It reminds me of this guy reminds me of like the Gos at Club Med.

242
00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:06.170
Yeah.
A club meds.

243
00:17:06.171 --> 00:17:10.310
A French vacation spot and there's a good chance this guy was a g.
Yeah.

244
00:17:10.311 --> 00:17:14.870
I think he may have.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The only leg that to Potty,

245
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.000
you'd see what the disco later.

246
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:22.220
Why don't you remind our audience that could tackle for those who are
unfamiliar,

247
00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.830
what the,
uh,
Geo said to you,
oh,

248
00:17:24.831 --> 00:17:28.220
I don't want to talk about really trying to forget it.
Well,

249
00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:31.850
I mean you brought it up,
but I just figured,
you know,
yeah.
I don't want to talk.

250
00:17:31.851 --> 00:17:34.520
I mean,
look,
I won't,
I won't.
When I was 28 with my dad,

251
00:17:34.521 --> 00:17:38.120
that's the last time I went to Club Med and my dad's been taking me in Club Med

252
00:17:38.121 --> 00:17:42.060
since I was like 11 party fun part,
the fun dancing,

253
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:46.070
dancing free page,
everything's included.

254
00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:50.040
I don't have to fucking pay more,
you know,
the everything at the

255
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.920
<v 4>bar,
I can get what I want all day long.
It's the best.
It's the best.
But for both,</v>

256
00:17:53.921 --> 00:17:58.560
I both rebel.
There is the best.
And so they are,
they're all French.
And um,

257
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:01.380
you know,
one of the GL is just hit on me grossly and was like,

258
00:18:01.381 --> 00:18:04.830
you want to come back to my room?
I have a bottle of lube and a mirror.

259
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:11.730
That's a real aggressive,
uh,
line,
you think?
Well,
yeah.

260
00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:15.800
Who takes him?
They can't be the first time he said that.
I mean,
was he soft?

261
00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.920
So say something like,
here's the odd part.
Is that this dude I was,

262
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:24.180
I was at breakfast and I was alone and I was working on jokes at the time.

263
00:18:24.181 --> 00:18:26.160
I was just writing jokes.
Yeah.

264
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.940
Fucking sit sitting by myself with a plate of fruit and he sits down next to me

265
00:18:29.941 --> 00:18:32.760
cause the gos are encouraged to socialize with the guests.
Yeah.

266
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:38.010
And they CICI with strangers at every meal,
which is horrible.
Horrible.

267
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.140
But it's French.
It's European.
They are,

268
00:18:40.141 --> 00:18:42.480
the whole thing is that you should socialize and meet new people.

269
00:18:42.481 --> 00:18:43.950
So I was sitting alone,

270
00:18:43.951 --> 00:18:48.060
which in Club Med world is considered bad and he sits down next to me and I

271
00:18:48.061 --> 00:18:51.030
forgot I didn't,
we were talking about the most banal things,
you know,
like,
Oh,

272
00:18:51.031 --> 00:18:55.460
you're with your dad angry.
Thinking about cruise ships.
Those are even worse.
No,

273
00:18:55.461 --> 00:18:57.600
I'm saying cause it's the same arrangement,
right?
Oh,

274
00:18:57.601 --> 00:19:01.210
when they seat you with people.
Ah,
is there anything worse than that?

275
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:06.060
I hated to fucking hate because it's energy to speak to strangers.

276
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.120
What do you do?
What do you do with,
where are you from?

277
00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:13.050
Where are you from with family?
My siblings always.

278
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:18.560
The first thing we do is try to locate the dining room manager and say something

279
00:19:18.751 --> 00:19:22.400
like,
we're,
we can't sit with another group.
And then like,

280
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.920
and then sometimes you have to like really push to make it happen.
Well,

281
00:19:25.921 --> 00:19:29.790
you're there with your family,
which implies to sit with a stranger.

282
00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:34.050
Why would you want to talk to anybody else?
And again,
it's just small talk,

283
00:19:34.051 --> 00:19:38.010
which I deplore small talk I don't want,
I don't want you to know where I live.

284
00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:40.300
How about that?
Yeah.
Terrible.
How about it?

285
00:19:40.301 --> 00:19:42.000
I don't tell you what I do for a fucking living.

286
00:19:42.001 --> 00:19:46.680
I don't want to talk about my job when I'm on vacation.
It's terrible.
Terrible.

287
00:19:46.681 --> 00:19:49.350
It's just float.
Yeah.
I like everybody.

288
00:19:49.351 --> 00:19:52.200
Shut the fuck up and have all I talked to you.
I want to like,
if I don't,

289
00:19:52.201 --> 00:19:56.010
you know,
I don't know.
It's forced to right away too.
Yeah.
He'd meet people.

290
00:19:56.011 --> 00:19:56.290
You're like,

291
00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:58.140
I don't want to have dinner with this person knows what they're having.

292
00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:02.370
You do know,
have dinner with them.
I don't want to have a meal,
which is sacred.

293
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.750
I mean,
you break bread with your family,
with your friends.
No fucking strangers.

294
00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:12.000
Some douchebag.
Fucking Dad boner.
Where?
From Shreveport?

295
00:20:12.001 --> 00:20:16.980
Where are you from?
Ah,
fuck.
And La,
Huh?
Yeah.
Earthquakes,

296
00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:21.270
you know?
Yeah.
And then they go,
they're always like,
ah,
no,
we're from Cleveland.

297
00:20:21.271 --> 00:20:25.320
And you're like,
okay.
And they're like,
hey,
de la.
Right.
Cool.

298
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:30.210
Everybody hates La.
And again,
thank you.
Everybody hates La,

299
00:20:30.211 --> 00:20:32.110
except for the people who live in now.
I know.

300
00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:36.680
That's the only that they feel the need to tell you.
I know.
I don't want,

301
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:39.480
no one goes like you don't go,
Oh,
you from Cleveland.
I fucking hate that place.

302
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:41.670
I don't know.
That would be rude.

303
00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.840
I live in La that I hate that place,
you know?
All right,
cool man.

304
00:20:45.841 --> 00:20:48.130
I swear it's my home.
It's one of the few

305
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.720
<v 5>cities where everybody can just openly say that and there's very little
pushback.</v>

306
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:55.640
Yeah.
Well,
we do have a lot of Douche bags.
I mean in,

307
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:57.760
in those people's different like show business,

308
00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:00.190
there's nothing do shear it then show business.

309
00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.040
But it's also not just no massive city.
I know,

310
00:21:03.041 --> 00:21:05.850
but most people don't know that there's like regular,
they'd be like,
oh,

311
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:10.420
people always like all these like small town fucking dorks that you meet that

312
00:21:10.421 --> 00:21:14.170
say stuff.
Like they'll go,
I'm not into Hollywood.
And you're like,

313
00:21:14.171 --> 00:21:17.590
what do you mean how they would be like,
ah,
showbiz and the red carpet.

314
00:21:17.591 --> 00:21:18.940
And you're like,
do you think that's everywhere?

315
00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:21.340
You didn't want to go out to dinner at the red carpet event.

316
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.800
This is the restaurant man.
Yeah.

317
00:21:23.801 --> 00:21:28.660
That's a very small section of this business I guess too.
There's,

318
00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:29.523
you know,

319
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.670
<v 0>I'm not in the movie stars,
but people tell me that all the time.
And I'm like,</v>

320
00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.370
okay,
do you think it'll be hard to avoid them?

321
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.110
<v 5>Well,
and also it's just a business when you think about it,
you know,
it's just,</v>

322
00:21:40.111 --> 00:21:40.970
uh,
Kate Hudson,

323
00:21:40.971 --> 00:21:43.700
I'm sure there's night she doesn't want to put on a dress and go to some boring

324
00:21:43.701 --> 00:21:46.550
ass award show.
Yeah.
For hours and hours and you know,

325
00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:49.460
put the makeup on and all that fucking shit to business.
Yeah.

326
00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:52.600
It is selling a fantasy guys.
That's all it is,

327
00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:57.080
<v 0>men.
Um,
so I guess we should,
we should get our Cox ready,</v>

328
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:59.220
but also,
um,

329
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:04.060
we should tell people if they don't already know what happened

330
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:08.320
<v 5>last year.
A cut Brian not mean God,
right?
I mean,</v>

331
00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:10.570
you're a cunt Brian,
not me.
Yeah,

332
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.830
<v 0>yeah.
Is the man
we uh,</v>

333
00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:19.880
we gave it to you.
We brought them into your world.
Yeah.

334
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.660
And then we had them in our world and have lunch with him.

335
00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:25.590
We had lunch with the Great Dan Pena.

336
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:30.720
<v 5>Can you believe it?
I mean,
like you said,
when,
when you met the guy,</v>

337
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:35.400
the bikes kid.
Yeah.
You were like,
this is amazing.
Ex Girlfriend,

338
00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.040
Dick's girlfriend,
right over the bikes kid.
I mean,

339
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:42.540
this is just the magic of the Internet that we see this guy's video.

340
00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:47.280
You knew I would immediately be fascinated and drawn to and love with Dan Pena.

341
00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:51.690
Yeah.
And then I kept it,
we,
I,
we had,
he came on the show with a Skype interview.

342
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:56.170
Skype from Scotland,
right.
Scotland,
sorry.
We're England,
Scotland,
Scotland.
Yup.

343
00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:57.900
And then,
um,
I kept,

344
00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:01.920
we kept in touch via direct message and he said he's going to come out here in

345
00:23:01.921 --> 00:23:06.000
March and then,
you know,
we made an appointment,
we had lunch with Dan Pena.

346
00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:09.510
That's crazy.
And this is why you're fucking crazy.

347
00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:11.700
The best part is that you and I dressed up.

348
00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:15.870
Well that was part of our thing was like,
I mean we thought about it and I go,

349
00:23:15.871 --> 00:23:19.800
I got to do it.
Um,
you know,
we wear t shirt and jeans every day.

350
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:23.760
Course omics.
What else is there for meetings and for everything.
It's just,

351
00:23:23.761 --> 00:23:26.940
that's how it is out here.
And it was like,
here,
this will be fun.

352
00:23:26.941 --> 00:23:31.080
Why don't we surprise him by dressing for the occasion?
Cause I knew he,

353
00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:35.910
I know he has a big thing about,
you know,
jeans and a dress like a fucking bum.

354
00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.760
So it was like,
let's,
let's,
let's do it up.

355
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.150
<v 0>Here's what happened though.
I first,</v>

356
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:46.490
I bought a suit over the summer and a nice suit.

357
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:51.620
I put it on and it was like,
it was like a little boy putting on daddy suit.

358
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.390
It's from the weight loss.
Yeah.
I couldn't even cinch it with a belt.

359
00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:00.110
How many looks,
I assert,
how many sizes did you go down?
Um,

360
00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:04.100
at least two full suit sizes.
So it made it,

361
00:24:04.101 --> 00:24:07.970
it looked comically ridiculous.
So I was like,
fuck.

362
00:24:07.971 --> 00:24:10.670
I think it was kind of throwing my whole,
you know,

363
00:24:10.671 --> 00:24:15.560
idea into to shit.
Right.
So I found another suit.

364
00:24:15.561 --> 00:24:20.420
It was also oversized,
but I go,
uh,
it won't look as bad.

365
00:24:20.421 --> 00:24:24.140
I don't know.
I just put a belt on.
I tightened it,
put the jacket on.

366
00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:25.573
Here's the thing,

367
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.370
you can back me up on this because you've heard me say this many times.

368
00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.900
It's one of my pet peeves is when I watch TV and there's a,

369
00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:36.800
you know,
a guy especially of means,
you know,

370
00:24:36.801 --> 00:24:40.820
a coach athlete.
Trump.
Yeah.

371
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:45.710
And they're wearing a poor fitting suit.
My God,
it kills me.
It makes me crazy.

372
00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.000
Donald Trump,
where's his fucking frumpy dump?
He wears,

373
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:55.900
he wears expensive suits that don't flatter his body type.

374
00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.790
It's terrible.
That's what,
that's,
that's the,
because he is of the mentality that,

375
00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:05.210
that if it's expensive then it's great.

376
00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:10.370
But the fabrics that he wears don't,

377
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.120
don't do anything for him.
He should be wearing thicker.

378
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.280
He was wearing like Charlotte lighter,

379
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:19.520
more luxurious fabrics and he should be wearing like thicker wool and the

380
00:25:19.521 --> 00:25:23.480
tailoring doesn't look,
tailoring doesn't look like I know some tail.

381
00:25:23.481 --> 00:25:24.080
And I tell you,

382
00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.910
it bothered me so much when I was looking in the mirror and I was getting ready

383
00:25:28.911 --> 00:25:32.690
to do,
even when we got to the hotel and I was like,
I can't ever,

384
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:36.840
I hated the way it sat on the shoulders,
uh,
past the risks.

385
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:40.730
It looked so goofy.
Daddy.
I did.

386
00:25:40.731 --> 00:25:43.070
I felt it was wearing daddy's suit like a little boy.
We're in daddy suit.

387
00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:46.660
It bothered me so much here.
I'm definitely going to go get another suit.
Um,

388
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.850
well we went across the street after lunch and we picked one.

389
00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:52.510
No looked at them at,

390
00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:57.710
but I also had to give the people that I bought the suit to back and he was
like,

391
00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:02.890
this is going to take days because we have to basically recut the,

392
00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.380
the jacket and the pants because you've lost.
It's like,

393
00:26:06.381 --> 00:26:09.970
it's not just a modification.
We have to recut and Riso this thing.
Oh.

394
00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:15.050
So I dunno,
I'm definitely getting another suit,
uh,
one that fits me like,

395
00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:19.250
you know,
for my size,
but it made me crazy.
That's just all I want to say.

396
00:26:19.251 --> 00:26:22.700
It made me crazy and it still makes me crazy when I see it in other people.

397
00:26:22.701 --> 00:26:23.420
And you go,

398
00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:28.190
why wouldn't you just have the Taylor bring that in half an inch here?

399
00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:33.470
Why wouldn't you have them bring the,
you know,
the waistline in just a bit.

400
00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:35.870
Just it costs you,
it costs nothing.
Nothing.

401
00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:41.330
Now it's really upsetting to me is my art teacher jacket,
which by the way,

402
00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.010
we've offended many an art teacher.
I

403
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.150
<v 5>know that my best friend is an art teacher.
She was very upset.
Yeah.</v>

404
00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.300
I had that jacket altered.
I,
it was just an h and m jacket.

405
00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:55.080
But at the time I was real fat after giving birth and I want it to look nice

406
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:58.890
even if I was fat and I was upset because I feel like I made an effort with that

407
00:26:58.891 --> 00:27:03.710
jacket.
And you still were like,
no,
no,
I know it's hideous.
So I tried,
you know,

408
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:08.550
I tried the art teacher jacket had to go.
I did.
It's gone.

409
00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:12.360
I know I gave it away.
Our Nannies sister has it now.
You really gave it away.

410
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:15.120
I did.
Well it's my husband.
If you tell me you don't like it,

411
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.210
why would I work with me that you hate?
Wow.

412
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.930
Then you have to look at me and you hate how I look.

413
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:23.340
You're the only person who really looks at me,
you know?
You know what I mean?

414
00:27:23.341 --> 00:27:26.760
On a daily basis.
You're the,
you're the one whose opinion matters.

415
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.870
I don't fucking look at myself.
Um,
so damn pain yet.

416
00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:36.090
What was it like?
I,
I texted some friends,
family and they were like,
oh,

417
00:27:36.091 --> 00:27:40.320
is he an asshole?
And it's funny cause I don't think of him as an asshole at all.

418
00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:46.490
The affection that I have for him is directly tied to youth football.

419
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:49.800
Oh,
I,

420
00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:52.940
I was drawn to coaches that were like,
that.

421
00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:57.240
The people misinterpret the yelling,
he's an asshole.

422
00:27:57.241 --> 00:28:00.690
He's mean for me.
It was trying to get the most out of you.

423
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:05.660
And a lot of times,
I mean,
my favorite coaches ever were guys like that.

424
00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.240
And then they would always,
you know,
they're the guys that you'd,

425
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:12.370
you'd die for anything.
For those guys,
I always say beware of the,

426
00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.300
the bullshit or the one who pretends to be nice all the time.

427
00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:20.340
The people who pretend to be perfect and not curse and be holier than that.

428
00:28:20.341 --> 00:28:22.650
Those are generally the ones you should watch out for.
Yeah.

429
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.890
It's not the guy that's looking to tell you what's up,
you know?
Yeah.

430
00:28:25.891 --> 00:28:30.870
But we had a delightful lunch with Pena and um,
you know,
we really,

431
00:28:30.871 --> 00:28:33.630
I mean,
we just kind of shot the shit caught up.
He was,

432
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:38.790
he was extremely gracious and ask questions about,

433
00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:42.000
you know,
what we're doing.
He asked questions about our business,
how things like,

434
00:28:42.001 --> 00:28:46.230
you know,
how touring works and all that and seemed interested in that.
And um,

435
00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:51.000
it was just,
it was a,
it was a nice time talking about family,
his family,

436
00:28:51.001 --> 00:28:55.520
our family life,
a little bit what he likes to do.
And you know,
he,

437
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:57.780
he,
he's been speaking a lot at schools.

438
00:28:57.781 --> 00:29:02.781
He says torn speaking and doing a lot of and also a bunch of charity stuff,

439
00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:05.330
charity stuff,
orphanages and stuff.

440
00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:12.510
Uh,
well really pleasant,
pleasant lunch.
Yeah,
it was fun.
Yeah.

441
00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:16.910
And then he did Joe show too.
He did.
He did.
Um,
yeah.

442
00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:20.680
Got In touch with Rogan.
He did Rogan's podcast.
Uh,
I got,

443
00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.080
I got caught a little bit of that.

444
00:29:22.081 --> 00:29:25.290
I was on the road and I remembered that they were doing it Friday.

445
00:29:25.291 --> 00:29:28.070
So I was at the gym in the hotel and I,

446
00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:32.760
I pulled up the live feed and I was watching he wear his Tux.

447
00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:35.970
He was wearing like,
kind of like what we wore to lunch.
Yeah.
With the bow tie.

448
00:29:35.971 --> 00:29:38.060
And his outlet for lunch was a,

449
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:42.010
it was a vest that was like,
what was the word for

450
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.530
<v 4>that?
What kind of vest is at,
it looks like a tapestry.</v>

451
00:29:44.531 --> 00:29:48.100
Kind of like when they do on colorful.
Beautiful.
Yeah.

452
00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:51.400
And then like a coat.
Right.
And then Nice slacks.

453
00:29:51.401 --> 00:29:53.570
And then he had on these great slipper,

454
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:58.590
they were like leisure ridiculous Versace kind of slippery,

455
00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:04.570
which is so cute.
It was great.
You know,
and the swag to pull it off.

456
00:30:04.571 --> 00:30:05.950
Massive swag.
Yeah.

457
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.310
So I guess he's visiting La for a minute and then he's going to go back to his

458
00:30:09.311 --> 00:30:10.690
castle and teach a seminar.

459
00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:14.890
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
Doing,
doing some traveling and uh,
yeah,</v>

460
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.470
teaching the seminar.
He only does a few of those a year.

461
00:30:17.471 --> 00:30:20.830
It's not like a year round thing,
you know,
I get the emails,

462
00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:24.760
the Qla seminar.
Yeah.
That's an intense thing.
I,

463
00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:30.210
part of me feels like I would do that to have like for the experience if I had

464
00:30:30.971 --> 00:30:34.780
the time.
Yeah.
But it's really intensive too.
I mean,

465
00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:39.580
apparently to go into that you fill out hundreds of questions and,
yeah,
yeah,

466
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:40.423
yeah.
So you get,

467
00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:44.950
because it's a limited class size is like no more than 16 or something 20 maybe.

468
00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:50.080
Um,
and sometimes smaller and so he knows you really,
really well.
But I dunno,

469
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:53.270
I just feel like it'd be something I would enjoy it.

470
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:57.550
But you have to wear a suit every day to class.
Be Fun to go shopping first

471
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.840
jeans,
you bum fucking fucking losers.

472
00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:04.720
Really crazy hours.

473
00:31:04.721 --> 00:31:08.290
He was saying they start at 8:00 AM and they don't go to bed till midnight.

474
00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:11.630
<v 4>Yeah.
This is why your fucking do you even push that?
No,</v>

475
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.840
I think my arm kind of bumbled.
Yeah,
that was the sole dad.

476
00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:19.700
He was telling me that I don't want to get up early and go to bed late and then

477
00:31:19.701 --> 00:31:23.190
he goes,
this is why you're fucking poor.
You just lectured me.
Yeah.

478
00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:29.450
Now he's so strong and he had all kinds of knee surgeries and yeah.
Big Guy.

479
00:31:29.451 --> 00:31:33.350
Too Big frame.
Taller than I thought.
Yeah.

480
00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:36.130
Taller and his skin looked amazing.

481
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:41.570
I got to say he his face,
no wrinkles.
No,
no.
I was like,
Damn,

482
00:31:41.571 --> 00:31:43.430
champaign you notice thing and stuff like that.

483
00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:46.430
What's going on you that Unicorn blood.

484
00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:51.370
<v 0>There's a thing though.
People should know.
I mean,
you should know this too.</v>

485
00:31:51.371 --> 00:31:53.230
If you're a big guy.
Um,

486
00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:56.470
oversized clothing in general,

487
00:31:56.471 --> 00:32:01.210
not just suits is worse looking then too tight,
not too tight.
I mean

488
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.280
big like way too big for you.
If you're a big guy,
you might be like,

489
00:32:06.281 --> 00:32:11.050
I'm going to buy a shirt two times bigger than my size.
You look terrible.

490
00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:16.020
Terrible.
It looks like a dress.
It actually highlights your fat.
Yeah,

491
00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:19.210
it looks terrible on television.
When you're on television,

492
00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.590
you should be tailored to fit you.
Not too tight so that your titties show.

493
00:32:23.591 --> 00:32:28.570
But people message me all the time that,
uh,
after we said that you should,

494
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:33.340
you know,
it's real easy to get jeans tegular just a little bit and they love it.

495
00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:35.770
Easiest thing to do when you buy jeans,
it doesn't matter.

496
00:32:35.771 --> 00:32:39.890
You go get a pair of Levi's or whatever,
then you go to a dry cleaner,

497
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:44.750
um,
or just whatever Taylor and you just have them make little,
you know,

498
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:48.920
maybe the hem a little bit up.
Maybe you need the waste adjusted slightly.

499
00:32:48.921 --> 00:32:51.980
Just so that it fits you well.
They look totally different,

500
00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:55.220
<v 4>you know,
cause back in the olden days,
uh,
that you,</v>

501
00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.300
you couldn't buy ready made clothing.
Everything was made for you.

502
00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:02.320
It's super expensive.
So now everything's off the factory.
But if you can just do,

503
00:33:02.321 --> 00:33:04.600
like you said,
little fucking little modifications,

504
00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.680
then you're going to look tight.
You are,
you're going to look good.

505
00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:12.400
<v 0>Hi In fucking tight man.
Um,
yeah.
So,</v>

506
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.240
uh,
I went out of town,
I went to Bethlehem,

507
00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:20.770
Pennsylvania and Jesus was born Masha and tech.
It been there.

508
00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:24.880
Foxwoods,
the Fox theater.
It was,
the weather was cray cray.

509
00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:29.110
I was getting real cold and then I did Boston mazing time in Boston.

510
00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:33.730
I say always is fucking incredible.
I like all those places you named.

511
00:33:33.731 --> 00:33:38.380
Actually Boston is the shit.
And uh,
the Wilbur,

512
00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:41.380
it's just like,
it's a magical place for standup.
I don't know what it is.

513
00:33:41.381 --> 00:33:45.550
Like it's a smart city.
Yeah.
Savvy,
savvy,
fun.

514
00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:49.050
The crowds are awesome.
I had a great time.
Great time.
Um,

515
00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:53.820
so thanks to everybody that,
that came out to the shows.
Um,
I was,
uh,

516
00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:58.090
here with Lj this weekend.
We went to the country club and I made a little,
yeah.

517
00:33:58.091 --> 00:33:59.620
Why don't we,
uh,
yeah.
If you've,

518
00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:04.910
I've never heard you this excited ever about anything.

519
00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:11.670
Jean got herself a high watch and uh,

520
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:16.950
you would really think you'd think she'd been in a cave for the last 25 years

521
00:34:17.441 --> 00:34:19.120
and she wasn't aware of a,

522
00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:23.440
I don't know any smart technology because I've never heard you like,
you're like,

523
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:27.820
I'm texting you from my watch.
I'm,
I'm,
I'm tall.

524
00:34:27.821 --> 00:34:29.710
I'm calling you from my watch or something.

525
00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:35.900
<v 4>I'm checking the weather from my watch.
Oh,
excited.
Here's why.</v>

526
00:34:35.901 --> 00:34:39.260
When I was a little girl and you dream about the year 2000,

527
00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:42.710
we were promised these fucking 17 years ago.
They know.

528
00:34:42.711 --> 00:34:47.000
It's funny thing is that they've been out for a while now.
How long the Iwatch,

529
00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.270
I mean,
at least at least a few years.
Well,
look,

530
00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:54.010
I grew up watching inspector gadget and I always am like James Bond Shit.

531
00:34:54.011 --> 00:34:57.710
And I always used to love and gadget would,
you could take fucking phone calls,

532
00:34:57.711 --> 00:35:00.530
but how did you miss it the last few years?
I just,

533
00:35:00.531 --> 00:35:03.170
you know what it is is that I don't wear a watch is generally true.

534
00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:07.100
And so I was like,
man,
I don't give a fuck.
You know,
what am I missing out on?

535
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:10.170
That's why I thought you when you were,
when we started showing interest,

536
00:35:10.171 --> 00:35:14.630
so I was like you're definitely not going to wear no cause I watch my swatches

537
00:35:14.631 --> 00:35:17.290
and I'm like my wife for like a week and then I forget you still

538
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:21.270
<v 0>well occasionally put one on and you'll wear it.</v>

539
00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:22.890
You know for a minute

540
00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:24.650
<v 4>you don't regularly do it.</v>

541
00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:28.940
But here's why my life changed is that with baby jeans.
Okay,
here's what I do.

542
00:35:28.941 --> 00:35:31.160
Cause when I go out alone with him,
when you're out of town,

543
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:33.650
it Jean baby jeans and I go to the country club,
right?

544
00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:37.740
I have to take the fucking diaper bag,
which means I can't carry a purse.

545
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:42.690
So I got my fanny pack now I got the fanny pack and then I got the phone.

546
00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.940
And they've got the baby.
I got the store,
I got the shit,

547
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:47.790
and every time you're texting me or let's say something,
you know,

548
00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:52.020
I don't want to dig for my phone every two seconds.
It's so irritating.

549
00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:54.030
I'm constantly looking for my phone.

550
00:35:54.031 --> 00:35:59.031
So this way it's on my route and every text that comes in and they can call you

551
00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:02.510
like you called us and I was on the road with a baby jeans and I just want to

552
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:05.770
boot like this.
I was driving like this and then I went,
whew.

553
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:09.270
Hi Gina and I could fucking talk to you.
And I didn't have to look for my phone.

554
00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.410
Wow.
I mean,

555
00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:14.020
I just like anything that prevents me from having to obsess about where,

556
00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.480
where's the phone?
What am I gonna you know?

557
00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:19.620
It's just one less thing in my life to fucking do it.
To see you this excited.

558
00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:23.100
Honestly.
You mean you like my joy?
I don't think so.

559
00:36:23.101 --> 00:36:25.620
I think you like it when I'm miserable.

560
00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:27.750
Why would I like it when you're miserable?
Just kidding.

561
00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.360
I don't know why I'm in love with it now.

562
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:33.210
Apple store can go fuck itself.

563
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:38.730
Every time I've ever stepped foot in there.
It is an absolute misery,

564
00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:42.150
God forbid if something should break and you should want it fixed.

565
00:36:42.151 --> 00:36:45.690
Cause that's another fucking quagmire.

566
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:49.970
Inefficiency shot.
Did fix the uh,

567
00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:54.630
the computer,
the Puente or hear the sound drop one?
Yeah,

568
00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.633
they fixed it.

569
00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:01.050
And then I realized that I had an older one that has an issue,

570
00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:05.160
not the same issue.
What kind of an issue like that?
So when I pick this one up,

571
00:37:05.161 --> 00:37:09.210
I go,
can you look at this one?
You gotta make an appointment,
do right here.

572
00:37:09.211 --> 00:37:10.044
He's like,

573
00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:15.370
so I know just to help me help please.

574
00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.840
You know,
as a store where you walk in somewhere and they have to go like,

575
00:37:18.841 --> 00:37:21.990
what do you need?
And then you're like,
I want to talk to someone about this.

576
00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:23.590
Go wait at that table.

577
00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:30.510
It's the coolest product and it's the absolute worst customer service.

578
00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.630
I fucking walked in there at baby jeans.
And if you have a toddler,

579
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:38.580
you know that you have exactly 20 minutes to do anything before that kid has a

580
00:37:38.581 --> 00:37:42.810
meltdown.
Those were the rules.
So I've rolled them in there and I go,
look man,

581
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:46.320
I got 20 minutes.
I'm alone with this toddler.
Get me my watch.
I know what I want.

582
00:37:46.321 --> 00:37:51.150
I picked it out in advance.
I stood there,
nobody was helping me and I'm begging,

583
00:37:51.151 --> 00:37:55.500
I go,
can I please give you $400 I have,
I have the money.

584
00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:00.360
Here's my,
can someone take money and put you on the list?
I said,
mother Fucker,

585
00:38:00.361 --> 00:38:04.590
that was 10 minutes ago.
Help me,
help me.
Oh,
I've gone busy and they're not,

586
00:38:04.591 --> 00:38:08.690
they're fucking doodling on their thing.
Oh my God.
I could've just,

587
00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:12.390
I live almost blew a gasket.
And then finally they help you.

588
00:38:12.391 --> 00:38:14.940
And then do you judge or Una just,
um,

589
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:18.150
when you're in the apple store and they have an older employee,
never,

590
00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:21.570
I will never got an older employee.
Never.
I'll take dreads.
Thank horse.

591
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:26.850
Of course I'll take the non binary with person with braces.

592
00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:30.400
It's like this fifth grader I talked to you GRANDPA card.

593
00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:32.740
They don't know what they're doing.
No,

594
00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.460
I want a millennial and looking at a maximum.
Yeah.
I think give me a millennial.

595
00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:39.620
And then the worst part is they go,
do you want to activate the watch now?
I go,

596
00:38:39.621 --> 00:38:43.090
of course,
what am I going?
What do you mean when I'm going to come back?

597
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.610
So then of course I go to the go over here,

598
00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.650
there's again 10 people like you said,

599
00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:51.980
and then one fucking employee helping all US old fogies activate.

600
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:54.100
So every 10 seconds when you know,

601
00:38:54.101 --> 00:38:56.820
then she has to come back when she fucking can.
Yeah.

602
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:59.080
And then he's of course he melted down.

603
00:38:59.081 --> 00:39:02.290
He started screaming and crying in the middle of the store.
Everybody stopped.

604
00:39:02.291 --> 00:39:06.490
They were doing and stared is terrible.
I had to give them goldfish and you know,

605
00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.310
put them in my lab.
It was terrible.
It's the worst source man.

606
00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:12.520
But the products are so cool.
I just keeps me coming back from war,

607
00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:16.430
like an abusive boyfriend and they're so mean to you or a drug there.
Terror.

608
00:39:16.431 --> 00:39:20.260
And also you start getting tied into your products being tied to each other.

609
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:24.710
Of course,
that's the real rack because you might go,
oh,
I want to,

610
00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.280
I'm on an Android,
I want a different phone.
But then you start to think,

611
00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:29.440
well you can,
but you start to think,

612
00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.370
will this be a headache and do I want to deal with that?
That's the problem.

613
00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:38.290
And I know in the day I want to break free.
I want to try other things.

614
00:39:38.291 --> 00:39:41.320
You know he do.
Yeah.
Wait a minute.

615
00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:46.810
I thought you were an apple loyalist.
No,
no,
they've,
I've just have products.

616
00:39:46.811 --> 00:39:50.380
I'm like,
I said,
they're tied together.
So I go,
Oh God,
it's easier.
Easy.

617
00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.770
He is convenience.
But that doesn't mean I don't want to try like an Android,

618
00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:58.510
you know?
Yeah.
So I want to try it.
You know what I miss is a blackberry.

619
00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:02.800
I know.
And I love it with the,
I like the pushy button.
Me Too.
We'll keyboard.

620
00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:07.900
I'm so sick of everything.
I type,
it never comes out accurately.
It's every,

621
00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:10.900
everything is changing.
And it's youth.

622
00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:16.690
You had girls night out too.
Well,
by Stan.
I did.

623
00:40:16.691 --> 00:40:18.490
I had dinner with girl,
have girlfriends.

624
00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:20.920
And how was that a good cause I never have fun.

625
00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:24.000
<v 7>I'm

626
00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:41.080
<v 4>you're recorded as talking to you.
Yeah.</v>

627
00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:46.580
You know what I think?
Why can't shit.
Why?
Because of that dinner,

628
00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.210
I had pasta and meat and cheese and I didn't.

629
00:40:49.211 --> 00:40:52.610
Now I haven't had enough veggie since.
Yeah.
I,
that's why I'm not shitting.

630
00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:57.830
God dammit.
You haven't had enough Veggie you think?
Yeah,
that's,
it's a fiber.

631
00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:01.070
So I had two bowls of soup soup and a mango and some coffee.

632
00:41:01.071 --> 00:41:04.340
I'm hoping that that will drum up some,
some fours and fives.

633
00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:08.360
That dog barking bit was so funny that I feel like I have to

634
00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:14.320
<v 8>muscle Myosin myofilaments lie side by side and the apes stones and I pan Aryton</v>

636
00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:21.240
The Actin and Myocin myofilaments interact.

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:44.070
Dallas,
Dallas,
Texas choice at the House of Bruise.

683
00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:47.600
I added a show and then I go to Justin,

684
00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:50.760
Texas the next few days.
All right.

685
00:44:56.510 --> 00:45:00.750
Um,
this I thought you might like,
I don't know if you'd seen this or not,

686
00:45:00.751 --> 00:45:03.840
but I had this bold for you.
Oh,
but you might enjoy,

687
00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:04.981
<v 3>what did you consider it?</v>

688
00:45:04.981 --> 00:45:09.981
A grown ass smile and to elevate and adult diaper having to clean it up.

689
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:16.190
<v 5>What do you consider those hangers?
Low.
Awesome.
Big Ole sloppy.</v>

690
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:20.730
She used to get those slap wagons under control.
Those are mushy purples.

691
00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:25.960
Damn Bitch.
She's not wearing a bra.
We'll look up.
Pick.
Those are crazy.

692
00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:30.840
Yeah.
That's got to hurt the back.
Right?
Sitting like that.
She's Chris.

693
00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:34.140
I'm sitting in a chair.
Dude,
let us dumpers.

694
00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:36.900
She needs to fucking harness those pigs

695
00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:40.200
<v 3>and I'm a feminist sex worker and an artist.</v>

696
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:44.930
<v 5>Sure.
As disco tits.
Those are hangers,
those milk.
Oh,</v>

697
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.100
she's got a,
what's it called?
Piercings in those?
Yeah.
Did,

698
00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:52.520
does flappers are nasty.
I can see that.
She's got,

699
00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:57.520
she's got tattoos on a t two nasty girl.

700
00:45:57.550 --> 00:46:01.530
Got that big old chess piece,
but discotheque man.

701
00:46:01.531 --> 00:46:05.880
What do you think those way?
I'll tell you as somebody that's got big mushers,

702
00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:11.190
I don't know.
I feel like they're five each.
At least it's got a nice face.
No,

703
00:46:11.191 --> 00:46:15.390
she's,
she's beautiful.
She's fine.
Then just big ole hangars call sloppers yet,

704
00:46:15.391 --> 00:46:16.060
dude,

705
00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:21.000
I just can I tell you as somebody that has huge hangers not wearing a bra,

706
00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:23.190
it's,
it's just so uncomfortable for me.

707
00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:26.670
I can't imagine it being in a regular thing just got done working and she's
like,

708
00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:30.450
oh yeah,
that's the best feeling.
When you get home from a long day,

709
00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:35.400
you take your bra off,
it's the best.
Is there something equivalent for men?

710
00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:38.790
I think pants off for men.
It's like a big thing.

711
00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:42.570
You just walk around in your boxer.
I love walking around in my boxers.

712
00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:46.680
He do it all the time in front of the nanny in front of everyone

713
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:52.220
I know.
Need to see your penis,
your lingo.
Power,

714
00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:56.460
strong coconut oil massage.

715
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:01.700
<v 3>I guess I'm my own pimp.</v>

716
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:07.690
I meet most of my clients in line through websites that I have profiles on back

717
00:47:07.861 --> 00:47:09.710
pages like craigslist,

718
00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.010
but mostly like services with like sex work.

719
00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:18.300
I have a Twitter and I get clients from that.
Funny enough to where,

720
00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:23.730
<v 5>yeah,
I think that's actually the safest place,
isn't it?</v>

721
00:47:23.731 --> 00:47:26.940
Because then you can kind of vet them a little bit and so there's this egg from,

722
00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:29.760
yeah.
Yeah.
This egg.
Exactly.

723
00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:31.080
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

724
00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:32.290
<v 3>Idealic London,</v>

725
00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:36.950
kind of like 150 from our supper.
Also,

726
00:47:36.951 --> 00:47:41.060
I do discounts depending on my clients,

727
00:47:41.061 --> 00:47:43.530
so if they're regulars and things of that kind of sex work,

728
00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:48.550
I do ranges from Webcam to escorting,

729
00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:53.830
making porn and domination services.
Maybe some ball kicking.
Punching.

730
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.820
<v 4>[inaudible] your favorite jitterbugging.
Yeah.</v>

731
00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:00.370
<v 3>Rad.
Femmes I swept a swath.</v>

732
00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:05.200
Is Sex work or sex work?
Exclusionary feminists.
Exclusionary.

733
00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:08.800
Who?
Basically also Tufts.
Excuse me.

734
00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:13.410
What for feminists would be like someone who's like anti-sex work cause
feminist.

735
00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:16.600
Who's Anti-sex work?
It's a lot for failure basically.
That's,
that's why.

736
00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:18.520
What's homophobia?
Oh,
homophobe.

737
00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:23.490
<v 4>Yeah,
right.
If you're,
if you're anti sex worker,
then you're,
you're homophobic.</v>

738
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:26.320
Hey Guy,
can I agree?
Yeah.
You agree?

739
00:48:26.321 --> 00:48:30.280
What if your anti-sex worker as a feminist,
I feel,
yeah.

740
00:48:30.281 --> 00:48:34.090
Maybe it's a little homophobic.
Yeah.
I don't know what that means.

741
00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:38.590
I'm pro sex worker.
That's why I'm always been pro sex work.

742
00:48:38.591 --> 00:48:43.370
A lot of women don't have many options and yeah,
it's a pretty decent,
I mean,

743
00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:46.960
especially if you're not getting beaten by a pimp,
you open your own shop.

744
00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:48.310
Me Too man.
Rode beef

745
00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:54.560
<v 3>like a dot on the son of feminist who will say that like pro like women's</v>

746
00:48:55.931 --> 00:48:59.410
movements and their prior,
like women have an agency,

747
00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:03.400
but then when it comes to sex with,
they completely against it.
When I'm fast,

748
00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:06.720
actually sex work can give a lot of their agency.

749
00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:10.630
It's better than being in like one wage job.
Right.

750
00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:15.840
<v 4>I don't know about that.
I mean
I've always chosen the minimum wage job.</v>

751
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:19.900
Personally,
I just hate feminists.

752
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.863
Uh,

753
00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:26.790
<v 3>he was like this really old man.
He was like in his like 70s or 80s,</v>

754
00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:32.120
and he wants it like hardcore spanking and he was going into surgery the next

755
00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:32.900
week

756
00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:37.860
<v 4>can,
he was like,
I might not come out of it alive,
so go for it.
Okay.</v>

757
00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:41.790
But he was super lovely.
I never saw him again,
so I don't know what happened.
Oh,

758
00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:44.280
eat the Brits.
Love that spanking shit.

759
00:49:44.281 --> 00:49:47.880
You know that there are hard and I really applaud an old guy going in for

760
00:49:47.881 --> 00:49:49.440
surgery doing that.
Oh yeah.

761
00:49:49.441 --> 00:49:53.210
You realize that guy was probably like this really might be my last hurrah.

762
00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:56.610
Gimme a good old Spanish.
Yeah,
that's it.
Right.

763
00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:02.040
There you go.
I was looking for the heat.
I don't see the clip for,

764
00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:05.160
she asked him what's the,
they asked her.
What's the weirdest thing?

765
00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:08.020
<v 3>I definitely have had difficult.
I ships in the pot.
You Go.</v>

766
00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:10.440
I don't even date many of them.
Um,

767
00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:15.160
I'm polyamorous and I only date queer people.
I don't even date men anymore,

768
00:50:15.161 --> 00:50:19.830
so not dating men has made it a lot easier now.

769
00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:24.840
A lot of my partners are also sex workers or have been sex workers while also

770
00:50:25.541 --> 00:50:28.160
just generally open.
I'm polyamorous.

771
00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:30.090
<v 5>Yeah,
for sure.
Is the way to go only by,</v>

772
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:38.130
okay.
They ask her what's the craziest request?
That's what I was looking at.

773
00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:43.250
If somebody asked her to suck off their dog for 10 grand.

774
00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:47.970
No,
there's no amount of money.
Oh she did?
Yeah,
she did.
No,
she did.

775
00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:53.090
You wouldn't it off a dog for 10 grand.
Beastiality is off the table.

776
00:50:53.091 --> 00:50:57.500
I boundaries bed.
Yeah,
but you're not hurting the dog.
He was kissing his penis.

777
00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:01.760
No,
stop it.
They're innocence.
They're like children.
No,

778
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:04.580
you wouldn't suck off a child for $10,000.

779
00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:09.660
Why would you let your Granddad jerk you off?
Yeah.

780
00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:13.760
On the Ferris wheel.
Of course,
if it meant I'm not retarded.
Oh,

781
00:51:13.761 --> 00:51:15.470
that was the best part that we forgot

782
00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:20.720
in at at lunch with Dan Pena.
He said,

783
00:51:20.721 --> 00:51:25.700
retard retards loud in a nice restaurant many times.

784
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:30.710
And it nearly caused me to lose my life because it was during bites and he'd be

785
00:51:30.711 --> 00:51:31.760
like,
yeah,
you know,
I'm just,

786
00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:35.080
I'm just kinda hauling these retards all over the goal line.
And I was like,

787
00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:40.640
like I could not control myself.
What I liked Dan pain,
like,
I mean,

788
00:51:40.641 --> 00:51:44.510
I've said it before is that just reminds me of almost everybody in my family.

789
00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:48.170
He's just Hungarian.
Like that's an old school,
Hungarian person.

790
00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:52.640
The way he taught us everything.
No nonsense.
Actually.

791
00:51:52.641 --> 00:51:55.010
I would say even my Stepdad was like that too.

792
00:51:55.011 --> 00:51:59.020
Just hardcore emigrant style dude.
It's old school.
That's all I,

793
00:51:59.021 --> 00:52:02.190
that's all that is.
I like it.
Hard knocks,
kind of Shard cock.

794
00:52:02.191 --> 00:52:07.040
Stefan knocks hard disks.
What?
So you had a really,

795
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:11.990
you had a really neat massage.
Yeah.
Fuck man.

796
00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:15.940
I was all,
please talk about this.
I love this.

797
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:20.300
There's an app you can use to put this on your act because I think it's so
funny.

798
00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:23.810
There's an APP.
I don't know if I want to,

799
00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:27.770
should we tell him we say the APP doesn't matter.
Don't say the APP.

800
00:52:27.771 --> 00:52:29.060
Don't give them a free fucking,

801
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:31.580
so there's an app they can pay like everyone else.

802
00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:36.380
There's an app where you can be,
can be anywhere.
You can be a home,

803
00:52:36.381 --> 00:52:38.600
you can be in a city.
I mean,
not everybody,
not every city obviously.

804
00:52:38.601 --> 00:52:42.600
So it kind of like Uber and your hammock.
He'd be your hammock taking a dump.
Um,

805
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:45.380
Costa Rica,
but I don't know if they have them there yet.
But anyways,

806
00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:50.920
so massage therapists side basically basically work anywhere can also join this.

807
00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:53.600
And then they're on their,

808
00:52:53.601 --> 00:52:57.620
basically they get a ping just like you would if you were an Uber driver.

809
00:52:57.890 --> 00:53:01.880
Do you want to go take this appointment?
Like that?
So you put in your request,

810
00:53:01.881 --> 00:53:05.630
I want 60 minutes,
90 minutes.
Uh,
this,
the time.

811
00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:10.010
And this is the,
uh,
that's how the prostitution should be,
by the way.

812
00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:12.710
I'm probably,
I'm sure it's going there.
Not they have an APP,

813
00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:15.020
they should have an app or you can just be like,
I want a dom,

814
00:53:15.021 --> 00:53:18.590
I want to change my diaper or want to be spanked.
Bang,
show up.
That's great.

815
00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:22.840
I know that happening.
It's probably a whole legal issue.
But law,

816
00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:25.800
the law is probably their problem.
Not In Nevada though,
right.

817
00:53:26.530 --> 00:53:30.520
<v 0>Um,
so anyways,
uh,
I've had a long week,</v>

818
00:53:30.521 --> 00:53:34.210
I'm in the hotel and I go get a nice massage,
go to bed.

819
00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:39.790
So I use the APP.
A person can they send you a confirmation?

820
00:53:39.970 --> 00:53:44.410
Someone's coming at this time,
you know,
that's all it,
whatever.

821
00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:47.680
Then the person texts you,
Oh,
you're at this hotel.
Yeah.
Cool.

822
00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.860
Shows up.
It's like

823
00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:54.050
<v 5>Karen and Trish came to mind.
Both of them.</v>

824
00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:58.640
<v 4>Yeah.
More often.
The one I kind of feel like it was,
yeah,
it was Chris.</v>

825
00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:03.700
<v 5>Yeah.
Christian treren showed up at the same time.</v>

826
00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:07.600
Oh my.
Um,
you know,
a little beat down,
a little down on life.

827
00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:12.520
Um,
one of the first things that I noticed,
uh,

828
00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:16.720
which you don't always notice what you always get with a massage therapist was

829
00:54:16.721 --> 00:54:21.721
the smallest strong smell of cigarette smoke usually that that profession brings

830
00:54:23.891 --> 00:54:27.720
in more health conscious person.
But I was,

831
00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:33.730
I was really flattered that prior to her coming up she had a nice cigarette.

832
00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:38.220
I tell you.
Yeah.

833
00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:41.740
<v 4>Uh,
cause I've had it happen to at the Thai places.
Yeah,
they'll eat,
you know,</v>

834
00:54:41.741 --> 00:54:45.850
you can literally see them in the alleyway like push button out that cigarette

835
00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:48.940
luminum and Kevin for you like dude,
you know,

836
00:54:48.941 --> 00:54:53.350
and then the food service industry and massage industry doctors,

837
00:54:53.351 --> 00:54:54.184
dentists,

838
00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:58.840
if someone can smell your hands you probably shouldn't smoke immediately before

839
00:54:58.841 --> 00:55:00.700
touching go also to not okay.

840
00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:06.090
<v 5>Massage table if your shoulders down but I'm was special with your face up.</v>

841
00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:10.540
That person's face is also right next to you.
So their breath,

842
00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:15.250
a lot of times you pick up on their breath,
you know,
you get a whiff of it.

843
00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:18.050
Yeah.

844
00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:21.800
<v 4>The best part about cigarette smokers,
cause I was a smoker for 17 years,</v>

845
00:55:21.801 --> 00:55:25.810
is that it just comes out of your pores.
It permeates,

846
00:55:26.050 --> 00:55:30.200
it's out of every orifice is and comes out of your nostrils too.
Like you just,

847
00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:34.790
you're a dragon,
you're just,
you smell like shit.
Smell terrible.
Yeah.
Affordable.

848
00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:39.230
I loved smoking and I still did.
I do it.
I was a more social smoker,

849
00:55:39.231 --> 00:55:43.730
but I really enjoyed it.
I love it.
It's a,
it's a fantastic habit.
Yeah.
Now it's,

850
00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:47.990
it's horrifically bad for you,
but I enjoyed smoking for a long time,

851
00:55:47.991 --> 00:55:50.020
but go ahead.
So,
so true.
So true.

852
00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:50.570
<v 5>She,</v>

853
00:55:50.570 --> 00:55:55.200
Karen Treren and Krisha Krisha um,

854
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:59.620
<v 0>she's,
you know,
massaging and then I,
I heard</v>

855
00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:04.500
<v 5>her go
and,</v>

856
00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:07.330
uh,
had like big throat clearing cough,

857
00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:12.400
smoker's cough and then we go,
excuse me.
And I was like,
it's okay.

858
00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:15.250
It was alarming.
It wasn't.
Okay.
What are you going to say?

859
00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:19.930
And their phone go off or did she silence it?
Cause you've also had that,

860
00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:25.000
it went off and uh,
she apologized.
Turn that off.
Um,

861
00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:28.520
she was nice enough,
but she also was,
she tried,

862
00:56:28.521 --> 00:56:33.080
she tried to start conversation rule number one.
No,
and I'm like,

863
00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:37.790
and so she was like,
are you from?
And I was like,

864
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:42.950
Los Angeles.
Yeah.
You in town for work or,
yeah.

865
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:47.120
What do you do?
He said a consultant.

866
00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:50.060
It's tech stuff.
Yeah.

867
00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:55.610
You've got friends here know you got kids.

868
00:56:55.970 --> 00:57:00.180
Where's this going and go?
Yeah.
You,
yeah,

869
00:57:00.181 --> 00:57:03.910
mine are older.
Interesting.
Is that,

870
00:57:04.310 --> 00:57:08.690
is that why you smoke?
Fucking,
they're all gone.
I just was like,

871
00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:14.870
please stop.
She,
she picked up on that.
Um,
I hate it.

872
00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:16.550
We can I give you a what?

873
00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:20.720
I'll tell you what I do to PR to preempt any sort of conversation during a

874
00:57:20.721 --> 00:57:25.550
massage.
Yeah.
What I do when they go,
any areas troubling you.

875
00:57:25.551 --> 00:57:29.300
I tell them the areas and then I go,
oh,
but I'm just looking to fall asleep.

876
00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:34.670
I'm probably going to pass out.
You warn them ahead.
I'm going to pass out here,

877
00:57:34.671 --> 00:57:37.820
so don't fucking say anything.
And that helps a lot

878
00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:42.350
when I was falling asleep.
See a lot of times you get,

879
00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:46.990
if you get massaged regularly,
you'll know that sometimes when,

880
00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:49.250
especially if you were face down,
they can't see your face,

881
00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:53.720
so you thought the massage therapist will whisper to you in a very calm,

882
00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:58.500
soothing,
almost halfway asleep voice.
They'll say you doing all right.

883
00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:04.230
Okay.
So that you feel it Gentili right.
Question.

884
00:58:04.290 --> 00:58:08.880
Yeah,
Tom,
it's time to turn it over now.
Take your time.

885
00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:12.430
They got to take,
I'm in a,

886
00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:16.080
I'm in that part where you're not quite asleep.

887
00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:21.600
Definitely not fully awake and then I hear doing all right.

888
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:23.880
I was like,
oh my God.

889
00:58:23.881 --> 00:58:28.881
I mean she said it so close to me and so loud that I almost shit my pants will

890
00:58:29.410 --> 00:58:33.720
shit on her table.
I was like,
yeah.
She was like,
alright,

891
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:37.680
turn it over now.
Yeah.

892
00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:42.200
And then did you get a whiff of her breath when she whispered to you?

893
00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:47.210
Oh she got,
she got close to you and you smelled her cigarette breath.

894
00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:51.500
Breath was hard.
That hands luckily because I was also like,
oh,

895
00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:56.210
sometimes therapists start with their hands under the table so you can smell

896
00:58:56.211 --> 00:58:59.170
them.
They'll have a Roma therapy on them.
And I was like,
Oh man,

897
00:58:59.171 --> 00:59:00.440
her hands are going to stink.

898
00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:04.370
But right away she has some lotion on them.

899
00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:09.380
It was masking the cigarette smell.
They're definitely on a breath.
There was no,

900
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:13.130
there was no attempt to mask either,
which I also appreciate it.
There was no gum.

901
00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:18.200
Yeah.
Again,
that,
that really is an occupation where generally your health,

902
00:59:18.201 --> 00:59:18.680
kind of how,

903
00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:22.490
what percentage of the time you think do you normally into a nonsmoker?

904
00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:27.740
<v 4>98%.
Yeah.
It's very rare.
The,
like I said,
the Asian ones,</v>

905
00:59:27.741 --> 00:59:30.380
sometimes in the alleyway they'll be smoking are there,

906
00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:32.840
or the worst is when you go to the Thai place and they're cooking,

907
00:59:32.841 --> 00:59:36.290
they're smelly food in the microwave and you can smell their food.

908
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:41.090
How their food stinks.
Yeah.
Smell.

909
00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:44.090
You can smell them or you can hear them eating in the break room.

910
00:59:44.091 --> 00:59:48.480
That's depressing.
But honestly,
I'll tell you

911
00:59:50.450 --> 00:59:55.100
generally,
uh,
yeah,
you don't really run into those types.
Yeah.

912
00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:56.773
Um,

913
00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:01.710
so last week after I had a really good point to make about this,
about

914
01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:06.440
not smoking,
the liberally I'll,
it'll come back to me.

915
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:11.710
We both been a while now with no cigarettes,
10 years for me,
10 years ago,

916
01:00:11.711 --> 01:00:14.630
I'm at seven or eight crazy.

917
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:19.130
I started to smoke when I was 25 which is late in life.
It is,
yeah,

918
01:00:19.131 --> 01:00:22.370
start early if you're really wanting to start to enjoy it more around shows

919
01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:28.940
or before.
Is that the best time?
But I just a certain point,

920
01:00:28.941 --> 01:00:32.840
I was like,
I gotta I gotta stop doing this.
You know,
I hit 30 and I was like,

921
01:00:32.841 --> 01:00:35.390
I can't do this past 30.
I'm going to die.

922
01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:37.380
Cause I started when I was 13 years old and,

923
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:42.440
and it was great for stand up to your right because the nerves that I used to

924
01:00:42.441 --> 01:00:46.420
get,
like I would just chain smoke before and then after the release and also it

925
01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:51.140
great.
So good smokes drinking and smoking together.
Coffee and smoking.

926
01:00:51.141 --> 01:00:56.090
Fantastic stuff.
Everything.
Shit man,
I come on,
don't you know,

927
01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:57.770
but I don't really miss it.

928
01:00:57.771 --> 01:01:01.220
I used to miss it when I would smell it on other people and now it's not the

929
01:01:01.221 --> 01:01:03.230
same.
I'm over it.
Um,

930
01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:07.220
last week after the mom cast was done,

931
01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:09.531
I think you all know,

932
01:01:09.531 --> 01:01:14.531
we love the movies and we went to a movie that everyone's talking about it.

933
01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:18.920
I've been dying to see it since I saw the trailer a couple months ago and that

934
01:01:18.921 --> 01:01:23.780
is,
uh,
Jordan peals movie get out.
Um,
I really,

935
01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:28.940
really enjoyed it.
So did I,
but I wish I would've been given a heads up.
Heads up.

936
01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:31.640
You're like,
right,
let's go to the movies.
There's this thing I want to see.

937
01:01:31.641 --> 01:01:35.120
And um,
I was like,
yeah,
great.
What is it?
You're like,
oh,
best if I don't tell you.

938
01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:39.410
Is that like a romantic comedy?
Is it like a fun thing?
And you're like,
yeah,
yeah,

939
01:01:39.411 --> 01:01:40.244
it's fun.

940
01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:44.750
And it's much like when I watch 12 years a slave and you told me that was a

941
01:01:44.751 --> 01:01:48.530
comedy and then about halfway through it I wake you up and I'm like,

942
01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:52.580
this is not funny.
This is not a funny movie.
Well,

943
01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:53.900
there's a couple of things which is,

944
01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:57.230
I guess we could start at the 12 years a slave.

945
01:01:57.590 --> 01:02:02.590
I thought with the name of the movie and the press that the movie was getting.

946
01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:08.890
No idea that that you might have known how not funny it was going to be.

947
01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:14.330
I thought it'd be like a dark comedy.
Nope.
Maybe like Django.
There's,

948
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:19.100
there's moments where it was,
you know,
there's moments of formal Tarantino.

949
01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.070
Yeah.

950
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:23.490
<v 0>This is not that.
Anyways,
when you asked me and I was,</v>

951
01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:27.540
I remember I had just gotten back from overseas and so I was,

952
01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.990
I was so jet lag.
I couldn't keep my eyes up and I was like,
you'll love it.

953
01:02:30.991 --> 01:02:33.630
It's really funny.
And I passed out and then when you were like,

954
01:02:33.631 --> 01:02:36.330
there's nothing funny in that.
I couldn't believe,

955
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:40.760
because this is the point in the movie where you asked me if the movie was heel.

956
01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:44.940
You're like,
this is fucked up was in the beginning there's a murder.

957
01:02:45.330 --> 01:02:46.163
One of the,

958
01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:50.970
like it's the kills the guy and he throw them off the back of the ship and

959
01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:54.670
you're like,
oh my God,
is this going to be like this?
And I go,
no,

960
01:02:54.671 --> 01:02:55.590
it gets really funny.

961
01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:58.160
<v 4>Yeah.
You told me it was funny.
Yeah,
I know.</v>

962
01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:02.790
But I really didn't think that you bought in to the leafy,

963
01:03:02.810 --> 01:03:07.810
when you say things I believe you realize so,

964
01:03:09.170 --> 01:03:12.290
but this time I didn't come on.
This wasn't that level of no,
but I,

965
01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:13.700
but I always like,

966
01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:17.900
I always hate when people are a wrongfully accused.

967
01:03:17.901 --> 01:03:20.100
Like those type of movies make me nuts.
And then I,

968
01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:24.530
I hate when people are so victimized.
Yeah.
Like this movie I get so like,

969
01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:29.060
like I get anxious and I feel so bad for them.
I hate it.
Yeah.

970
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:34.230
I just hate it.
Yeah.
We don't want to,
I definitely don't want to ruin this movie.

971
01:03:34.231 --> 01:03:35.840
A good movie though.
Go see it.
It's really good.

972
01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.190
<v 0>Yeah.
The,
the,
the setup is that it,
you know,</v>

973
01:03:39.290 --> 01:03:44.290
I would say it deals with race and it deals with race relations in a really

974
01:03:45.621 --> 01:03:48.290
clever story.
Um,

975
01:03:48.350 --> 01:03:51.860
and there's so many small,
you know,

976
01:03:52.070 --> 01:03:57.070
subliminal things and suggestions and metaphors throughout the movie.

977
01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.710
Yeah.
It's what kind of movie that I know a lot of people are seeing it twice.

978
01:04:00.810 --> 01:04:01.040
Okay.

979
01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.960
<v 4>Cause you do want to see it now.
I would like to see it a second time.
Yeah,</v>

980
01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:04.431
just took,

981
01:04:04.431 --> 01:04:07.370
see the stuff that I didn't see the first time and it's Jordan Peele who,

982
01:04:07.371 --> 01:04:07.641
you know,

983
01:04:07.641 --> 01:04:11.630
a lot of people know from key and Peele wrote it and directed it and I did,

984
01:04:11.631 --> 01:04:15.660
it was made for four and a half million dollars and over the weekend it crossed

985
01:04:15.661 --> 01:04:19.460
the hundred million dollar.
Excellent.
Good.
Yeah.
Do it.
Go see it.

986
01:04:19.461 --> 01:04:23.510
Help support and other comic and was the best part too is that we saw it with a

987
01:04:23.511 --> 01:04:27.900
lot of black people in the audience,
which was way fun to too.

988
01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:32.340
There's a lot of cheering.
There's a lot of motherfuckers screaming.
Yeah.

989
01:04:32.530 --> 01:04:34.430
A lot of like damn boy.

990
01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:37.640
Like so I was like homeboy and like it was really fun.

991
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:42.100
Laughs it's a theater experience.
Yeah.
This will,
this will be,
yeah.

992
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:47.020
<v 0>Different if you rent it.
Yeah.
If you rent it on and when it gets to Itunes,
uh,</v>

993
01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:50.130
if you,
you know,
if you see a screen or something,
it will,

994
01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:54.360
this is a fun movie theater experience.
Yeah.
So my,

995
01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:59.250
my advice is that if you're considering going to the movies,
see that movie,

996
01:04:59.251 --> 01:05:00.960
because it's going to be out of the theater soon.
You know,

997
01:05:00.961 --> 01:05:04.050
like these movies don't,
it's already done a run.
If you,
if you think about it,

998
01:05:04.051 --> 01:05:08.850
movies now are in theaters for like two weeks,
right?
So I would go see it,

999
01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:10.920
try to go see it at a buck theater.

1000
01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:13.910
That's Sophie because it really does change the entire

1001
01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.710
<v 4>do.
Do you remember the guy that was kept yelling,
homeboy?
Oh,</v>

1002
01:05:16.711 --> 01:05:17.710
yours the funniest shit.

1003
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.420
<v 5>Or when when certain things happen to certain characters,</v>

1004
01:05:22.421 --> 01:05:27.010
I don't want to give anything away,
man.
The cheers,
the screams.
It was,

1005
01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:32.420
it was really,
really,
really fun.
It was cool,
really cool.

1006
01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:38.230
People were really going crazy.
The only thing I've never done,

1007
01:05:38.231 --> 01:05:41.330
I've never seen him a dia movie in the theater and I thought,
Oh my God,

1008
01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:43.980
I love the Medea movies.
I love to see one of the,

1009
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.490
I want to go to like a black theater though and see it.
I'm pretty cool.
Yeah,

1010
01:05:48.491 --> 01:05:51.100
that would be,
um,
that's something we can,
we can set that up.

1011
01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:53.770
Yeah.

1012
01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:00.870
Well this is for you because obviously you don't know how to do this Christ

1013
01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:06.500
and we've all done this.

1014
01:06:08.890 --> 01:06:10.450
Ended up picking out exit

1015
01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:14.780
easy cracker.
Yeah.

1016
01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:19.660
Finally being a genius new product that let you crack open eggs,
separate eggs,

1017
01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:21.400
even crack hard boiled egg.

1018
01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:24.870
I need an easy,

1019
01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:29.210
simply insert an egg into the grateful and squeeze instantly.
Crack.

1020
01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:32.740
Really Real.
This is real because it's a problem.

1021
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:35.260
Did you see the examples?

1022
01:06:35.350 --> 01:06:39.560
Like every day you can crack on this.

1023
01:06:41.490 --> 01:06:44.380
I'm so stupid.
You right there on the counter.

1024
01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:51.550
No more messy.
Oh God.
I gotta just keep rubbing it in.

1025
01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.940
Separates any size ag

1026
01:06:58.810 --> 01:07:01.560
where you're fussing over,

1027
01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:06.510
mom,
will you make more A's?
Eggs?
All right.

1028
01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:09.763
Oh,

1029
01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:14.870
can I get in the cradle and oh,

1030
01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:18.750
and it catches the yolk.
Wow.
If it works that way,
I mean,

1031
01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:22.380
what would make you think that?
It doesn't work that way.
It never works.

1032
01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:26.670
I guarantee it
shows everything.

1033
01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:29.310
Fucking shell.
Susie cracker,

1034
01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:35.050
he reminds me of a new show.
I got you.
Uh,

1035
01:07:35.410 --> 01:07:38.090
why don't you make a new album and call it easy cracker.

1036
01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:42.210
You should do that fucking crack.
Oh my God.
He called me that.

1037
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:45.860
I just got you into the great British baking show.

1038
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:50.440
I've seen bits and pieces of one of the earlier seasons you were watching and it

1039
01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:54.680
got enough.
I got enough interested where I do it,
dude.
Season two,

1040
01:07:54.681 --> 01:07:55.580
like I like cooking.

1041
01:07:56.900 --> 01:08:01.520
I like baking because it's so hard and it's so scientific and there's a really

1042
01:08:01.521 --> 01:08:06.521
perverse satisfaction that I get from watching them make it,

1043
01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:11.230
showing it,
wanting to eat it,
and then not eating well.
You know what,

1044
01:08:11.231 --> 01:08:14.660
it's like pornography or something.
You know what I do?
I like to put,

1045
01:08:14.661 --> 01:08:16.280
we have fragrance maker.

1046
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:18.080
<v 4>What is that called in the room?</v>

1047
01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:23.260
Jane the diffuser and I put in sugar cookie oil and vanilla oil and I diffuse

1048
01:08:23.751 --> 01:08:27.230
that smell in the room and I light candles and that way I feel like I'm,

1049
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:30.170
I'm being a bad girl without actually eating the treats.

1050
01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:33.950
I feel like I had a dessert when I,
yeah,
you know,
that's why I watch it.

1051
01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:35.690
We were off,
the carbs were off the sugar,

1052
01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:38.790
but I can watch someone else bake it and I liked that part,
you know,

1053
01:08:38.890 --> 01:08:43.890
and some of them make also there's an artistic element are beautiful and and all

1054
01:08:44.721 --> 01:08:46.670
those British teeth and it's just all so nice.

1055
01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:50.690
Season Two's teeth were horrific and we just started season three and those

1056
01:08:50.691 --> 01:08:51.920
teeth are way better.

1057
01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:57.050
But season two wolf talk about the dog pound in those teeth really bad.

1058
01:08:57.410 --> 01:09:01.250
And that's the stereotype with,
you know,
British people,
and I hate to say it,

1059
01:09:01.251 --> 01:09:03.650
but season two really fulfilled that stereotype.

1060
01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:19.070
Really exciting dental update guys.
Now in a,

1061
01:09:19.071 --> 01:09:21.110
and as I Rooney and fate would have it,

1062
01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:26.140
this segment started Tom when I had a root canal a few years ago and had to put

1063
01:09:26.421 --> 01:09:30.920
a crown on this bottom back molar back door.
And that's when this started.

1064
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:33.440
Dental updates,
full circle.

1065
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:38.450
I'm having this crown replaced again because it was done in correctly the first

1066
01:09:38.451 --> 01:09:43.160
time and it didn't line up with the rest of my team.
So I have a temp in there.

1067
01:09:44.190 --> 01:09:45.520
Yeah,
you see it?

1068
01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:52.720
It's like the wrong color.
It's all white.
Like really,
really white.
Yeah.

1069
01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:57.110
And I'm Steve Harvey's going jazz's billboard's going and the lady told me,

1070
01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:58.550
the dentist told me,
he goes,

1071
01:09:58.551 --> 01:10:03.470
now you don't want to chew anything hard or sticky cause it'll tear it out.

1072
01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.810
And if that happens on a weekend,

1073
01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:10.430
don't call me cause I don't want to open the office to just put a temp back in

1074
01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:15.080
while you can do is go down in the store and get some denture cream and just

1075
01:10:15.081 --> 01:10:17.750
glue it back in until Monday.
And I was like,

1076
01:10:17.751 --> 01:10:20.490
well that's a really neat thing to say.
Thank you doctor.
Yeah,

1077
01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:25.040
we don't really do that for you.
That's what that means.
Harvey,

1078
01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:29.840
Steve or a friend,
Garth.
Uh,
but luckily,

1079
01:10:29.841 --> 01:10:32.180
knock on wood,
I haven't ripped it out yet.
The thing is,

1080
01:10:32.181 --> 01:10:34.190
every time I've ever had attempt to thin,

1081
01:10:34.191 --> 01:10:38.540
I've had temp teeth and a few times they always fucking fallout.
Always.

1082
01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:39.800
But you know what he told me,

1083
01:10:39.801 --> 01:10:44.060
which was interesting is that because I've had this tooth root canal,
he's like,

1084
01:10:44.061 --> 01:10:46.880
if the crown falls off,
it doesn't matter.
It can't rot.

1085
01:10:47.010 --> 01:10:50.570
Like you can't get bacteria and it's already dead.
I'm like,
that's neat.

1086
01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:52.100
That's kind of an interesting story.

1087
01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:57.580
Now the struggle for me has been though I can't floss around the temp.

1088
01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:01.600
Yeah,
and I've been eating bitsy does like that.
Yeah.

1089
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.930
I ate some meat the other day.
I got wedged in there,
Bacon this morning.

1090
01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:08.450
It's all wedged in there and I can't do a fucking thing about it.

1091
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:11.930
Just wait till they take it out.
It's going to stink really bad.

1092
01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:16.890
And I've been flossing all the other teeth,
but it's a Massey damn.
Well,

1093
01:11:16.891 --> 01:11:18.810
you got to be some niche.
Here's the good news.
Now listen,

1094
01:11:18.811 --> 01:11:20.340
here's a second part to my update.

1095
01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:25.350
So I found out that my veneers actually can't be stained.

1096
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:28.620
So this whole time I've been worried about that standing my veneers,

1097
01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:31.020
but my natural teeth can be stained,

1098
01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:36.260
so I'm going to Whiten my teeth to match my veneers because it's been a couple

1099
01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:38.580
of years since I've whitened.
And then when are you going to do that though?

1100
01:11:38.670 --> 01:11:41.670
I'm going to do that the day I get my new crown.
Next week I'm going to do bang,

1101
01:11:41.671 --> 01:11:42.060
Bang.

1102
01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:46.020
Crown takes 15 minutes and then I'm going to have him whitening in the office.

1103
01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:49.380
And you're going to be super jealous when you see how beautiful my teeth.

1104
01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:50.071
I don't know.

1105
01:11:50.071 --> 01:11:53.580
I think I'm most thinking I might have you actually do my whitening trays

1106
01:11:53.581 --> 01:11:56.140
tonight,
which he never did.

1107
01:11:56.690 --> 01:12:01.480
You always say tonight we see that the great British baking show.
Yeah.

1108
01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:04.800
Okay.
And we took Ellis to the dentist for the first time too,

1109
01:12:04.801 --> 01:12:05.890
and he had a dental chair.

1110
01:12:06.210 --> 01:12:09.810
He had flying colors because mom's been brushing his teeth already.

1111
01:12:11.010 --> 01:12:15.090
Yeah.
He really loved having his teeth checked.
Two hated that fucking terrible.

1112
01:12:15.091 --> 01:12:18.660
It was horrifying.
Anyway,
you've been having trouble.
Yeah.

1113
01:12:30.670 --> 01:12:32.350
<v 7>What happened?
What's going on with you been,</v>

1114
01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:36.560
<v 4>I'm not trying to show off but I've been doing so well.
No,
you are showing on.</v>

1115
01:12:36.561 --> 01:12:39.300
I don't know.
It's just so easy.
I don't know.

1116
01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:43.950
You've been bragging about your browns all day today.
Yeah.
And you had,

1117
01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:48.420
I mean you made changes yesterday cause you had trouble yesterday and then you

1118
01:12:48.421 --> 01:12:51.180
said,
ah,
I'm going to have some,
what's some fruit?
Okay,

1119
01:12:51.181 --> 01:12:54.510
so yesterday when it happened I had some ones,

1120
01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:59.540
I made a number of their kibbles and then I thought of I have some mango that

1121
01:13:00.001 --> 01:13:03.330
usually pushes down the brown.
It didn't work.
That's usually a goto.

1122
01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:06.180
So today I made coffee to start the day.

1123
01:13:06.230 --> 01:13:10.840
Of course I did not think it pushed out a few kibbles and then I made,

1124
01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:16.140
yeah,
you made poop soup and you had two bolts by the third ball.

1125
01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:17.640
We're going to start to see some action,

1126
01:13:20.130 --> 01:13:24.850
<v 7>mango
and more coffee.
And when I got back in here</v>

1127
01:13:27.130 --> 01:13:30.020
[inaudible]

1128
01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:35.250
<v 4>you know what the problem is?
Saturday I broke the Diet.
I had a ton of sugar,</v>

1129
01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:39.660
I had wine,
I had pasta and cheese.
So my body is fucked.

1130
01:13:39.690 --> 01:13:42.960
I got to get back on fiber.
It's all about the fiber intake.

1131
01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:50.310
Now.
Last night we were laying in bed and you go,
what do you think?

1132
01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:55.320
Do you think I'm going to Fart or do I have to shit?
And I said,

1133
01:13:56.190 --> 01:14:00.750
judging by your,
it's your travel day.
And usually when you announce it like this,

1134
01:14:00.751 --> 01:14:03.510
when you,
when you question it,
that means a shit's coming.

1135
01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:05.640
We're breaking it down for me.

1136
01:14:05.641 --> 01:14:09.150
I started to laugh and the laughing prompted me to go,

1137
01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:11.010
isn't that I got to go?

1138
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:14.530
<v 0>Yeah.
And then you had a shit today when you got home</v>

1139
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:20.920
this morning.
Yeah.
Why has God blessing you so much?
God blesses you.

1140
01:14:20.921 --> 01:14:24.430
Why don't you rub offs into that chocolate on me?
No,
no,
no.
Just the way it goes.

1141
01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:28.810
The way it goes.
Pretty lucky guy.
Yeah.

1142
01:14:29.890 --> 01:14:34.510
Yeah.
Thanks.
I feel bad for you.
Actually.
I do too.

1143
01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:39.580
I hate being cost.
I hate number ones.
I hate type.
It's not even a shit.

1144
01:14:39.670 --> 01:14:44.290
Oh,
we should talk about it.
The Facebook page.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1145
01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.470
Dirty and disgusting.
Um,

1146
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:52.830
so you guys know that we have a Facebook page and we post some stuff there.

1147
01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:58.380
We've been doing actually Facebook live videos after the podcast is done

1148
01:15:01.061 --> 01:15:03.220
recording.
So like when we're done with this right now,

1149
01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:08.500
we'll post a video live from here.
Um,
hopefully I'll be browning.

1150
01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:12.340
Yeah.
So that's something that we started doing at anyways.
There's that.

1151
01:15:13.210 --> 01:15:18.210
Some fans that listen to the show started a live or a Facebook group,

1152
01:15:18.490 --> 01:15:23.220
it's called,
um,
you have to,
yeah,
Facebook groups.

1153
01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:27.550
There's,
there's your mom's house podcast page.
That's us.

1154
01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:30.370
And then you're at your mom's house podcast group.

1155
01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:34.390
So search under groups on to go to the green tab on Facebook and put in your

1156
01:15:34.391 --> 01:15:37.480
mom's house.
And as some of the funniest shit,
man,

1157
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:41.020
they tastic they are killing it.
I mean,

1158
01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:45.490
as people are posting stuff all the time and the comments are fucking

1159
01:15:45.491 --> 01:15:47.370
hysterical.
Um,

1160
01:15:47.950 --> 01:15:52.360
there's some people really like the Jimmy Dean sausage bit so much.

1161
01:15:52.361 --> 01:15:55.870
There's a lot of people posting that people are like,
I took a brown today.

1162
01:15:55.871 --> 01:16:00.030
Like just post.
Yeah.
Uh,
Oh,
here's the present time.

1163
01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:05.440
This was really,
this made me laugh really hard.
This is,
uh,
somebody posted this.

1164
01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:09.040
Hi,
Mommy's mushy per mercy purple Patty here.

1165
01:16:09.550 --> 01:16:13.240
I just wanted to say that I saw my mommy last night.
Tommy buns in boss.

1166
01:16:13.241 --> 01:16:14.820
Come at [inaudible].

1167
01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:19.000
We drove two hours to see the champ and we're not disappointed.

1168
01:16:19.001 --> 01:16:23.200
I was pleased to see that he finally took Christina's advice to perform his

1169
01:16:23.201 --> 01:16:25.090
jokes as a mentally challenged person.

1170
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:29.530
His performance put to shame Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump.

1171
01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:32.620
Sean Penn and I am retarded.

1172
01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:35.830
The man can do anything.
Yeah.

1173
01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:38.800
It was overwhelming to be in the presence of greatness.

1174
01:16:38.801 --> 01:16:42.550
He was perfection in human form.
Tom was so good at one point.

1175
01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:46.090
I forgot that he wasn't retarded.
Game Changer.

1176
01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:48.820
He's paving the road for a future comedians.

1177
01:16:48.821 --> 01:16:52.880
I wouldn't be surprised if you saw other people trying to copy his act,

1178
01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:56.510
but just don't have the stand [inaudible] to pull it off.
Hopefully we can.
He,

1179
01:16:56.540 --> 01:17:00.010
he can.
He just keeps pushing and training.
You know what I'm saying?

1180
01:17:00.011 --> 01:17:03.630
Tom Cigarette is retard champ.
Wow.
Um,

1181
01:17:04.570 --> 01:17:09.430
there's a lot of posts like that.
Just funny shit,
man.
Photoshop.

1182
01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:10.070
Yeah.
They're all

1183
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:11.150
<v 4>videos.
They found,</v>

1184
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:15.590
the thing that I love about this is that I've been wanting this since day one is

1185
01:17:15.591 --> 01:17:18.920
a place for mommies to go and meet each other and make new friends.
Yeah.

1186
01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.630
I wish we could do a dating site.

1187
01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:24.230
That's just people who love our show and then they can meet other,
you know,

1188
01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:27.830
I feel like guys,
gals,
non binaries who are just came out with this here.
There's,

1189
01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:30.120

Yeah.
Already there.

1190
01:17:30.121 --> 01:17:32.600
It just start in it or that grew over the weekend.

1191
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:37.420
<v 0>Yeah.
And they're doing like dad posts,
Brown posts.
Um,</v>

1192
01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:41.710

my favorite,
he's like,
I figured it out.</v>

1193
01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:46.870
This is just your mom's house is a place for immature adults there.
Right.

1194
01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:51.750
And it's totally true.
Yeah.
It's totally true.
That's true.
No,

1195
01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:55.960
I'm a member of the group,
but I did you join?
Yeah.

1196
01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:58.410
Did they accept your membership?
Yeah,
of course.
Okay.

1197
01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:01.870
Because I was debating whether or not to join cause I'm like,
oh,

1198
01:18:01.871 --> 01:18:04.390
is this going to be weird for people?
Will they be like,

1199
01:18:04.391 --> 01:18:07.970
this is like your parents,
you're looking at your Facebook page.
Oh right.
No,

1200
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:10.930
I'm saying yes or no claim but I don't think so.
I don't think it was happening.

1201
01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:15.250
Um,
pretty funny though.
It's,
it makes me laugh a lot.
Funny stuff.

1202
01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:20.530
Why am person I posted something recently.
They were like,
hey guys,
real talk.

1203
01:18:20.531 --> 01:18:21.850
Does it bother you ever?

1204
01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:26.200
Would they talk about brown talk and everybody is like,
no,

1205
01:18:26.201 --> 01:18:29.490
the only thing better than brown talk is burping or whatever.

1206
01:18:30.230 --> 01:18:33.200
<v 0>Got to use some guy wrote in like,
what's going on with this group?</v>

1207
01:18:33.201 --> 01:18:35.070
I thought this was something else.
Like what's this all guy?

1208
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:39.080
Yet he got lit up with 300 plus comments.

1209
01:18:39.290 --> 01:18:42.350
I mean I love it,
but I really funny stuff.
Like people were like,

1210
01:18:42.351 --> 01:18:44.510
your genes are low and loose.
You didn't get your life.

1211
01:18:45.730 --> 01:18:48.590
You don't have any common your balls.
Like nobody actually answered.

1212
01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.560
They just used all jokes.
Uh,

1213
01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:53.460
<v 4>it's so funny because somebody was like,</v>

1214
01:18:53.461 --> 01:18:57.660
I have to quit my job because it's getting in the way of enjoying this Facebook

1215
01:18:57.661 --> 01:19:02.130
group.
It's true.
I'm on there and I keep looking at it.

1216
01:19:02.131 --> 01:19:03.450
So funny dude.
Okay.

1217
01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:04.500
<v 10>Oh,</v>

1218
01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:10.370
<v 0>for a long time.
A long time.
People always asked us to do some besides</v>

1219
01:19:13.690 --> 01:19:18.440
<v 7>my brown.
Oh good.
So we finally did a Hoodie.</v>

1220
01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:19.730
This is a,

1221
01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:24.420
<v 0>it's super,
super soft hoodie.
Like you know there's that material.</v>

1222
01:19:24.421 --> 01:19:29.100
It's very soft kind of lighter hoodie.
It's a lighter,
like a spring Hoodie.

1223
01:19:29.130 --> 01:19:32.250
Yeah.
So when you're kind of in between the seasons,
maybe this is a good,

1224
01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:36.180
it's not like a super heavy one or a summer eve.
Really great material.

1225
01:19:36.330 --> 01:19:39.480
And it says Jean Singular,

1226
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:41.910
singular because that's our new name.

1227
01:19:42.170 --> 01:19:47.130
Jean Jean in denim lettering,
but very well done.

1228
01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:52.140
It's on the,
it's in the store.
So I was always for your support.

1229
01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:55.600
I think you'll,
you'll very much enjoy it,
Jean,

1230
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:58.820
<v 4>for those of you don't know this,
the references at first,</v>

1231
01:19:58.821 --> 01:20:03.380
we call each other genes.
Mommy genes,
genes.
And then we had a worker in our home.

1232
01:20:03.381 --> 01:20:06.590
Was it the carpenter?
The old man who shit in my house,
electrician,
electrician.

1233
01:20:06.591 --> 01:20:09.210
He came here and he,
within five minutes of meeting me,

1234
01:20:09.211 --> 01:20:13.590
took a dump in our bathroom.
Yes.
But he heard Tom calling me genes.

1235
01:20:13.950 --> 01:20:18.540
And so when we answered the door and the Entercom,
he goes,
Hey Jean,
it's me.

1236
01:20:18.541 --> 01:20:22.050
And I was like,
did he just call me Jean?
And it happened.

1237
01:20:22.230 --> 01:20:27.230
And now is gene gene [inaudible] gene.

1238
01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:29.740
And when you went to Canada,
I called the John St James.

1239
01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:32.430
Y'All Belge when you're in Canada.

1240
01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:35.180
<v 5>I'm very excited.
We're very excited about the Hoodie.</v>

1241
01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:38.410
Check it out when you get a chance.
All right.
Um,

1242
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:43.190
Saint Jean,
this came in.
I haven't heard it,

1243
01:20:43.191 --> 01:20:47.210
but I'm already excited.
Myla Kunis Mila,

1244
01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:52.830

She's not Hungarian,
but she's like,
she's Rooskie playing.
Yeah.

1245
01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:58.050
Um,
apparently she has some really profound vocal fry shut up

1246
01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:01.800
<v 1>inside the rack houses of Jim beam.</v>

1247
01:21:02.370 --> 01:21:07.370
Thousands of barrels lay silent [inaudible] inside each and every Jim beam

1248
01:21:10.621 --> 01:21:15.030
barrel.
The Bourbon is building a fuller,
smoother flavor.

1249
01:21:16.130 --> 01:21:19.020
Only comes from being aged four long years.

1250
01:21:20.730 --> 01:21:21.720
Made from the inside.

1251
01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:23.193
<v 5>Uh,</v>

1252
01:21:23.410 --> 01:21:27.980
<v 4>yeah.
I'm guessing that she's trying to sound more sultry.</v>

1253
01:21:28.490 --> 01:21:32.090
Social.
She's going lower and maybe that's why it's coming out.

1254
01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:35.660
She speaks Russian.
She does speak Russian and she's a smart broad.

1255
01:21:36.010 --> 01:21:36.843
<v 1>That doesn't mean</v>

1256
01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:42.690
<v 5>she's married to Ashton Kutcher could Cushner yeah.</v>

1257
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:47.090
Future flavor flavor there for long years.

It's always there.

1261
01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:04.520
You know about this?
Yeah.

1262
01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:11.280
<v 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1263
01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:13.410
<v 4>Yeah.
She's going to teach you out.</v>

1264
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:15.223
<v 1>No thanks.</v>

1265
01:22:23.650 --> 01:22:27.020
<v 4>Wow.
But how do you get it?
I mean,
how do you get the air in?</v>

1266
01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:31.810
Cause I don't just queef when I lay on my back,
it doesn't just come out.
Well,

1267
01:22:31.811 --> 01:22:34.600
how would you teach someone to do it?
I don't know how to do it on command.

1268
01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:37.670
I don't know how.
I mean I,
it's,

1269
01:22:37.671 --> 01:22:40.480
it's only accidentally that that's happened accidentally.

1270
01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:03.430
<v 1>I got it.
Right,
right.</v>

1271
01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:05.560
<v 5>That's good instruction far</v>

1272
01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:09.473
<v 1>sandwiches.</v>

1273
01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:13.173
<v 5>The funny farm</v>

1274
01:23:14.330 --> 01:23:18.030
<v 1>I've had.
No,
I'll give you a few samples goes great.</v>

1275
01:23:19.890 --> 01:23:20.723
Okay.

1276
01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:23.950
<v 5>She's great.
Do you think,
what do you think her friend situations,</v>

1277
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:25.710
like what do you think are dating situations?

1278
01:23:25.711 --> 01:23:27.750
Like what do you think are parenting situations like go?

1279
01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:35.010
I think her friends say she's the best and loyal friend.
Good girl.

1280
01:23:35.090 --> 01:23:35.923
Yeah.
Uh,

1281
01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:40.940
a lot of guys feel like she is a two groups and uh,

1282
01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:44.310
she doesn't have a lot of longterm relationships.
No.
No.
Well look,

1283
01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:46.890
it's one thing to know it's her dad.
What else?

1284
01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:51.130
Well it's one thing to do this in front of your buddies like drunk.
Yeah.

1285
01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:54.600
It's another thing to actively make a video and put it online.

1286
01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:57.190
That's a really bold choice.
Yeah.
I mean

1287
01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:04.550
<v 1>of your fanny packs.
Fanny Fart.</v>

1288
01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:09.330
Fanny's your cooch.
Yeah.
Oh yeah,
we have a sloppy what?

1289
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:13.900
<v 5>Sloppy one.
Yeah,
She Australian or English.</v>

1290
01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:16.590
She's awesome.
Yeah,
she's doing the um,

1291
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:22.390
she's using the same principles of changing the pitch of your bug farts with her

1292
01:24:23.541 --> 01:24:26.040
fanny farts.
Oh that's an interesting idea.
Yeah.

1293
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:30.260
She's telling you if you move your legs like this and remember last night when

1294
01:24:30.261 --> 01:24:33.470
we were getting the snack.
Yeah.
God Damn Snag.
Yeah.

1295
01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:37.050
You were walking towards me in the kitchen and you were mad.

1296
01:24:37.550 --> 01:24:41.150
You birthed and then you lifted your leg up and you farted.
Yeah.

1297
01:24:41.210 --> 01:24:43.730
That was really special.
I was really disappointed that I,

1298
01:24:43.890 --> 01:24:48.260
I couldn't get them in sequence.
All right.
Cause you go,
you go,
cause you went,

1299
01:24:48.290 --> 01:24:51.590
you went.
It's not,
it's not a double pipe.
It's not a double pipe.
Yeah,

1300
01:24:51.690 --> 01:24:55.280
you're were like,
it was seconds away.
It's not like you can't half a second one.

1301
01:24:55.281 --> 01:24:59.060
Yeah.
You were in phatic that it wasn't and you know,
I wasn't even thinking that.

1302
01:24:59.061 --> 01:25:01.970
I was just like,
look at the choreography on that.
That it,

1303
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:06.160
a leg lifts you birthed.
I was blown away by your moves.
Thank you.

1304
01:25:06.350 --> 01:25:07.920
Very turned on.
I could tell.
Yeah.

1305
01:25:13.310 --> 01:25:14.143
<v 1>Ooh.</v>

1306
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:22.690
All right.
So,
oh right.
I keep forgetting that to her vagina.
Oh,

1307
01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:23.390
you forget.

1308
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:26.480
<v 5>I just forgot it.
Can't stop thinking about it.
I just forgot about it.</v>

1309
01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:27.920
But you forget.
I don't know.
I just,

1310
01:25:27.921 --> 01:25:30.490
for a moment I got distracted by the story of Migrate Fart.

1311
01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:34.610
<v 1>Yeah.
I'll just try it some more.
Ooh,</v>

1312
01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:41.650
no,
and just for license,
all your Pi,
your angriness site,

1313
01:25:42.130 --> 01:25:46.910
your stress,
it just helps you guys get the Aa rare.
I think it smells.

1314
01:25:47.210 --> 01:25:48.470
No,
not at all.

1315
01:25:49.170 --> 01:25:53.600
<v 5>Her Vagina or just in general?
General briefing.
I don't think so.
It should.</v>

1316
01:25:53.601 --> 01:25:56.790
It depends if your he smells right.
If you're,
if you're,

1317
01:25:56.850 --> 01:26:00.210
if you have a strong odor down there,
then the wind coming out of it probably.

1318
01:26:00.430 --> 01:26:04.340
Right.
I mean,
you know,
if he ever keep it clean you shouldn't.
Yeah.

1319
01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:07.933
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

1320
01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:13.000
<v 5>And that was really nice.
Thank you lady.
Yeah,
that was kind of a,
yeah,
exactly.</v>

1321
01:26:13.001 --> 01:26:16.900
You know,
I'm glad we can't make out her face too much for her benefit.

1322
01:26:16.901 --> 01:26:20.200
Would you date the Queef girl?
Be Honest.
You know,

1323
01:26:20.201 --> 01:26:21.700
let's say like I'm the Queen of girl.

1324
01:26:21.730 --> 01:26:26.730
What if I made that video when I was 20 years old and everybody in the club was

1325
01:26:27.071 --> 01:26:30.160
like,
listen,
Tom,
did you,
have you seen Christina is queen video?

1326
01:26:30.161 --> 01:26:33.620
I know you guys are dating.
Oh yeah,
I dunno.
I would definitely rate her.
No,

1327
01:26:33.630 --> 01:26:37.030
it wouldn't be a deal breaker.
I mean,
you're a comic and I,
I would,

1328
01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:41.320
I would probably find it funny.
Yeah,
no,
I would still go out with you.

1329
01:26:41.590 --> 01:26:45.070
What'd you demand that I do?
The queef I'm sure it would come up.

1330
01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:46.360
I'm sure it would come up.

1331
01:26:46.361 --> 01:26:49.960
I don't think that you could have that out there and me be like,
oh,

1332
01:26:49.961 --> 01:26:53.620
just overlook that.
Completely know how would ask about it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1333
01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:57.520
Do you want me to learn how to do that?
I think it would add a little spark,

1334
01:26:58.930 --> 01:26:59.763
some fun

1335
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:04.800
<v 11>if two wheels are locked on an axle so that they are not free to turn
separately.</v>

1336
01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:07.290
One or the other.
As to slide,

1337
01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:11.820
he boy engineers had to find a way to connect both rear wheels to the engine

1338
01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:14.530
without sliding and slipping on turns.

1339
01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:19.270
The device which makes this possible board now is a part of the rear axle now on

1340
01:27:19.370 --> 01:27:23.520
the differential looks complicated,
but once we understand its principle,

1341
01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:27.450
it is amazingly simple.
These two wheels are molded on separate.

1342
01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:29.810
<v 5>You're done and I should find that interesting.</v>

1343
01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:34.970
My Dad was a mechanic of course yet,
but I just don't care.
I don't care.

1344
01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:38.330
Yeah.
I kind of want to know how cars work,
but not really.

1345
01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:41.480
You want to see a dad owner before we could ask?
Yeah.
I Love Dad boners.

1346
01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:43.880
This is a dad boner.
I think he's feeding birds.

1347
01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:50.120
Let me see if this says anything here.
Dad voter.
It goes to the park feed birds.

1348
01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:54.020
Oh,
he's stuck by how many there are.
Oh,
I love it.

1349
01:27:55.430 --> 01:28:00.040
<v 12>I don't know.
But that's a month.
The damn birds,
after I'm at Mudd,</v>

1350
01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:04.130
they all over the damn place.
I got me a little sack of,
and he had seen my brain.

1351
01:28:04.131 --> 01:28:08.390
I'm always thinking,
man,
I've been asked Steve and some of them marriage,
see me.

1352
01:28:08.391 --> 01:28:09.600
Oh yeah,
I bet.
Today Leah.

1353
01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:15.370
<v 5>Whoa.
Something tells me he's not from Boston.
Jesus.</v>

1354
01:28:15.930 --> 01:28:18.110
<v 12>Oh,
look at that</v>

1355
01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:25.330
with all my food and have a look out.
Oh look,

1356
01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:27.940
I'm good Lord.
That's a numbers girl,

1357
01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:32.470
Mami and all my brand.

1358
01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:35.200
<v 5>It's hilarious.
He's really exciting.</v>

1359
01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:37.780
<v 12>Oh,
look at me screaming at me and</v>

1360
01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:43.810
look at them off coming in.

1361
01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:52.600
I don't know.
What the hell am I looking at the time?

1362
01:28:54.330 --> 01:28:58.320
<v 5>I don't know if I concentrate him as a dad.
Boehner necessarily.
No,
I'm excited.</v>

1363
01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:03.150
I'm about,
I'm about as excited as he is,
right?
