1
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.290
Well,
well,
well go to your mom's house,

2
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.383
Christina.

3
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.550
<v 3>It was terrible because we were going to start doing stuff like that.</v>

4
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.580
I took such a squirrely dump this morning.
Cool.

5
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.210
I feel like we didn't really get to talk about it.
You don't need to.
Here we go.

6
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.520
<v 4>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.310
<v 3>How does this work?
What are you doing?</v>

8
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.410
<v 0>Um,
so what we're doing is we're practicing Tantra and uh,</v>

9
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.660
one of the key things that most people don't realize is that orgasm is different

10
00:00:49.151 --> 00:00:51.910
from the traditional release that comes from climax.

11
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.770
<v 3>Okay.
There we go.
That's what I forgot to do.</v>

12
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.740
Plug in whatever thing needed to be plugged in.

13
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.970
<v 5>Got It.
And was ranting.</v>

14
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.760
Don't bring it in one loving no bar.

15
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.073
<v 1>Well,
welcome.</v>

16
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.750
Well go to your mom's house with Tom Circle.

17
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.990
Christina pushes.
It's interesting.

18
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.650
<v 3>Oh,
that was fun.
Um,
so I don't know if you remember the,
uh,</v>

19
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.210
<v 5>Hi Melanie.
I'm Scotty with ecstatic hearts.
Tantra.</v>

20
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.860
I was just wanting to share that there are many ways to orgasm actually have to

21
00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:17.280
be having sex.
You can orgasm just from hugging.

22
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.340
<v 3>Yeah.
Uh,
so we showed you these discussing people a while ago.
Yeah.</v>

23
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.570
Become huggers and,
um,

24
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.600
apparently now they're doing international interviews about it.

25
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.030
It's a stupid,
yeah,
it's so dumb.
It's so horrible.

26
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.090
She's real gummy and I don't really like to shit on people's mouths too much.

27
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.080
You don't know.
I'm like kind of really open minded and stuff about Pete.

28
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.700
Seems like it's,
there's so much more to go after that.
You,

29
00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:48.770
you didn't need to do that,
but go ahead.

30
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.090
No,
it was just a little gummy.
Okay.
But I,
I,

31
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.860
I hate them so much and I'm trying to like what do you hate about them?

32
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.180
I just feel like it's tea.
It's total nonsense.
Like it's,
it's just,

33
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.640
it's horse shit.
It's so,

34
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:10.240
and it's such like a waste of energy.

35
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:12.730
Like I feel like they're good people.
They're nice.

36
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:14.500
You could tell they're nice people.
They're totally nice.

37
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:19.480
But like feed orphans in Romania or like dig wells in,

38
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.550
in Uganda.
You know what I'm saying?
Like does it,

39
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:23.620
does it really have to be about coming?
Haven't we?

40
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.650
Haven't we done enough for orgasms in,
in society?
I Dunno.

41
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.760
I mean if they can really teach everyone to come hug,
that's pretty big.

42
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:33.970
And there's so many more problems in the world.
I mean,

43
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.230
<v 0>instead of having the traditional trajectory where you kind of get excited and</v>

44
00:03:39.231 --> 00:03:40.820
then climax and then go to sleep,

45
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.560
you're able to have the experience when you keep going and you can start having

46
00:03:45.561 --> 00:03:46.394
multiple experiences.

47
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.560
<v 3>No,
you mean that the awesome part where you not and you're like,
I'm out.</v>

48
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.700
What's Elena?
And then stop talking at night.
Get outta here.

49
00:03:53.701 --> 00:03:55.560
Don't touch my stuff is the best part right now.

50
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.040
Did you notice that he's shorter than her when they're standing and then they've

51
00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:02.490
made him taller than her and sitting.
He also looked like he put on some weight.

52
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.890
Interesting.
Well,
when you're come hugging,

53
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.200
maybe you're just laying down all the time.
It doesn't,

54
00:04:07.201 --> 00:04:11.600
he look bigger than the no,
I don't think so.
Look at his face there.
Okay.

55
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.110
<v 0>Hi Melanie.
I'm like the weight weight</v>

56
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.220
maybe.
Yeah,
maybe man.

57
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.090
When you decide to chase,
huskier might come down to here,

58
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.340
but you're in an orgasmic state that can last for a long time.

59
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:34.360
So then we'll start kind of going down again so you can eat and play and then

60
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.010
bring it back up again.

61
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.600
<v 3>Okay.
He's so excited.
The dude listening to this,
right?</v>

62
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.940
Let's count.
You could get me calming too.
Oh,
oh.
So

63
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.240
can you get me to come hug me mom

64
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.520
every Sunday for t?

65
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.080
Meanwhile you get me to come one a day that normally my wife has to tug on me

66
00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.400
balls to come on me nuts.
Yeah,
I love it.

67
00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:05.210
She's like 20 years old and he's a thousand.
Totally normal.

68
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.170
That camera ready.
He's gross.

69
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.220
<v 0>He's got a tank from the,
from the commercial point of view,</v>

70
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.870
your point of view,
because that is that ultimate,

71
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.750
you're not doing that for 18 hours.
I mean,
Michelle,

72
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.473
<v 3>you have no more.</v>

73
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.730
Do you know what's really annoying about these two is that they're always like,

74
00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:32.800
they're always having a smile and being character.

75
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:36.850
Like we're just always ecstatic.
So great,

76
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.963
great.

77
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:40.580
<v 0>That's the thing.</v>

78
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.540
Two different things so you can actually have a full body orgasm.

79
00:05:44.541 --> 00:05:47.930
It's actually more helpful than anything you've done before without the

80
00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:50.790
traditional release and up drain of energy.
It's

81
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.310
<v 3>confusing.
Um,</v>

82
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.640
content feelings with orgasming you feel the tingling.

83
00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.820
You mean like if you hug someone and you're happy about it,

84
00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:01.430
like endorphins or whatever,
you just feel good.
And he's like,

85
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:04.070
we're orgasming right now.
No,
you're not.
Yeah,
maybe.

86
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:05.870
I don't think he's having a heart.
I think he's confused.

87
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:09.170
He's thinking that we're confused.
I think he's confused.
Yeah.
I think he's quite,

88
00:06:09.171 --> 00:06:13.910
yeah.
Of clearly these people are misguided.
Yeah.
What do you mean,
like tingling?

89
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:16.840
Yeah,
it feels good.
I gave someone a hug.
I like it.
Yeah.

90
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.640
But we're old or not hug town.
They're rolling sensation.

91
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.330
How is he teaching you to come hug?
Asmec how does it,

92
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.440
how do you teach the calm hub?
That's a very good point.

93
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.190
You can't teach a calm hug either.
You can or you can't count how.
Yeah.

94
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.680
I think it's,
it's a,

95
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.710
it's a little suspect when there's two people in the com hugging,
you know,

96
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.220
business and everyone else is like,
I hug,
I come,

97
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.890
how come I can't make them line up like you guys?
And they're like,
oh,

98
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:44.870
you need to take our class.
That's true.
If I,

99
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:48.380
if I met other couples that they've taught to come hug successfully,

100
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.050
then maybe it's always them.
You know?

101
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:54.500
I wish we could send your parents to go learn to come hug with these two.

102
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:58.100
Oh my God.
That would be the best.
That would be the best segment ever.
Ever.

103
00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:01.970
On anything.
Your Dad would love it.
Yeah.
Just keep hugging.

104
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.250
I'm going to come after that.
Sounds like fun.
Did you come buddy,
buddy?

105
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.970
I gave you a hug,
but I want to come on you.
God,

106
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.050
I got trained.
I come when I hug now pal

107
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:17.773
dad.

108
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.740
<v 6>We practice Tantra,
which helps us to,
oh,</v>

109
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.400
the sexual energy up our bodies.

110
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.880
So the longer we make love,

111
00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:30.980
the more energized we get.

112
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.310
<v 3>Okay.
Yeah.
I hate that they're from Los Angeles.</v>

113
00:07:35.311 --> 00:07:39.020
These two I'd say this is the,
these are the people that give us a bad rep.
Yeah,

114
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.903
I may.
What?
I mean

115
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.310
<v 6>chicken be going to sleep at 10 and by dawn we're like,
yeah,
I can,</v>

116
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.820
the flavor you have to be getting,
and he urges me to keep going.

117
00:07:48.821 --> 00:07:53.740
I then I just keep getting more energized every time.
Oh,
I'll be going.

118
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.070
<v 3>Sure.
How about that rob?
Posto right.</v>

119
00:07:58.071 --> 00:08:00.800
We're talking about when they are not actually fucking baby.
No,

120
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.430
they're talking about fucking to,
Oh,
now there are times when the actual fucks.

121
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.930
Yes.
Well,
uh,
I don't like her voice.

122
00:08:08.931 --> 00:08:12.770
She talks like the dumb girl that you do the impression of.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

123
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.140
<v 6>I'm at [inaudible] House.</v>

124
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.660
<v 3>How bout like,
we should keep data?
Um,
uh,
ah,</v>

125
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:29.490
and then I felt energized after was like,
I,

126
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:37.260
yeah,
like don't you,
you do know what you sound like when you talk.
Right?

127
00:08:37.261 --> 00:08:41.190
Like she's no awareness then she sounds totally ridiculous.
Yeah.

128
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.860
<v 6>Oh,
you've never bust out laughing.</v>

129
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.630
Ha
laughing.
Oh yeah.
We,

130
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.040
the truth is we all have our emotions.
It love making,

131
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.040
we laugh.
Look at

132
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.180
<v 3>ourselves.
We cry.
Where's that drive plus question though?</v>

133
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.660
I think that's the question that everybody's thinking about is that her vagina

134
00:09:03.661 --> 00:09:05.450
will dry out from so much of that meeting.

135
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.180
Can you imagine if we had 18 hours sessions?
No,
I can't.

136
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.200
I know you said like at night and then by fucking sunrise,

137
00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:16.650
it's like where you want to fuck for nine hours.
You don't got no kids.
No.

138
00:09:16.651 --> 00:09:18.720
You know what I'm saying?
They ain't got no time.
Even if you,

139
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.710
let's say you didn't,
do you want to fuck for a half a day?
Oh,

140
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.310
I got stuff to do that.
Well,
here's the thing is I want to do that Trish and Bob,

141
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.800
Bobby,
uh,
we get our free gone and then it's straight to the,

142
00:09:30.801 --> 00:09:34.140
the routine we got to flipping out to catch up on and we've got the Shahs of

143
00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:38.550
sunset there shows to watch.
We've got and finish Ozar,
Ozar.
You know what I mean?

144
00:09:38.551 --> 00:09:39.900
Like real married couples.

145
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.560
You gotta you gotta fuck and then do the stuff married couples do.
Yeah.

146
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.980
You can't just fuck,
fuck,
fuck all the time.
It's silly.
No,

147
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.680
there's other parts to American college.
You know what I'm saying?

148
00:09:49.681 --> 00:09:52.020
You know what I'm saying?
You guys gotta go downstairs,
get your snack,

149
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.200
get give the dogs treats.
Yup.
You know what I mean?
There's all these things

150
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.960
<v 0>I do.
I feel you,
in order to do this kind of thing,</v>

151
00:09:57.961 --> 00:10:02.520
you have to be connected with your emotions and your feelings and your channel

152
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.680
so that you can feel the energy moving through your body.

153
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.830
And that's what makes it kind of a spiritual practice as well as just the

154
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:08.923
orgasmic one.

155
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:14.610
<v 6>Very loud making all the time.
And it totally wasn't orgasmic experience as well.</v>

156
00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.420
<v 3>All right.
Fuck all blah blah.</v>

157
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:22.500
I feel like studio London might think the studio Los Angeles is retarded.

158
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.490
I think they're right.
Yeah,
I agree with studio London on this one.
Yeah.

159
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:31.560
This is embarrassing.
Sorry.
Angelenos and I'm,
I'm,
I'm apologizing piles.

160
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.520
Ah,
you're talk like La.
I hate,

161
00:10:35.521 --> 00:10:39.390
I hate when la girls talk like that.
It's so embarrassing.

162
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:43.230
What time are they doing this show?
I'll xy.
I'll la Ha's off.

163
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.460
I was all like,

164
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:50.370
you don't necessarily have to be together to make this work because this is an

165
00:10:50.371 --> 00:10:53.970
energy exchange.
You thinking you can be in separate rooms and do this.

166
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:59.010
<v 6>Yeah.
Um,
so first of all,
we can feel each other.
Even when we're apart,</v>

167
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:05.530
we can out of them all by ourselves just through breathing and like feeling,

168
00:11:06.351 --> 00:11:08.160
um,
orgasm with God.

169
00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.260
<v 3>Okay.
I'm sure your mom would like that part,
right?
Yeah,</v>

170
00:11:11.261 --> 00:11:13.780
that'd be the best part my mind for sure.

171
00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:19.840
Like religious people,
just like you learn about face right here.
Studio London,

172
00:11:19.841 --> 00:11:24.190
guys face.
Did you just say you're going to come with God?
Yeah,

173
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.800
fortunately this is the end of the clip that we have.

174
00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:32.150
I would love to hear the followup to that.
Ahca calm with God.
Like,

175
00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.660
I'm sorry,
what did you just say?
Okay,
Sweetie.
Super disrespectful.
Yeah,

176
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.820
very calm with God.
Yeah,
buddy.

177
00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:44.770
Your mom and I a me man with God.
Yeah.
Anyway,

178
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.060
it's so gross.

179
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:50.500
What would your dad would talk to you about his come hugs all the time,

180
00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:54.040
but if he could do it,
maybe.
I don't know.
He,
he was never that

181
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.540
<v 7>guy.
I know some guys,
you know,
their dads would get</v>

182
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.300
<v 3>little too familiar.
A little personal with that stuff.</v>

183
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:02.860
Thank God he wasn't like that.
He was,

184
00:12:02.861 --> 00:12:06.310
I mean he's like the obviously with bathroom stuff,
but now it's sex stuff.

185
00:12:06.311 --> 00:12:09.150
Thank God.
And it's real traumatizing as a child here.

186
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:13.430
That what makes it difficult?
I mean,
I've proud of him for like full Bush,
right?

187
00:12:13.431 --> 00:12:17.020
Like big cans.
Right.
But he doesn't act like no details.

188
00:12:17.021 --> 00:12:21.820
I don't want to discuss to,
I've never detailed God.
It's borderline incestuous.

189
00:12:21.821 --> 00:12:25.570
When your parents tell you about their sex lives or what turns them on,

190
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.570
it's like,
I don't,
you're never supposed to know that stuff.
One time we were,

191
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.930
we were on like a little weekend trip that nasty.

192
00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.600
<v 7>And there was a couple they had,</v>

193
00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:39.590
they were new labor each other's second marriage and they each had their own

194
00:12:39.591 --> 00:12:43.940
kids.
And the dad,
uh,
I was talking to,

195
00:12:43.941 --> 00:12:48.920
his son was 15,
and he had on some high school sweatshirt with football on it.

196
00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.880
So he started talking about football and he was like,
yeah.
I was like,

197
00:12:52.881 --> 00:12:54.530
he's a big kid.
And he was like,
yeah,
you know,

198
00:12:54.531 --> 00:12:57.470
he plays whatever position and blah,
blah,
blah.

199
00:12:57.471 --> 00:13:02.270
And then I'm sitting there talking to him.
I remember this guy now and he goes,

200
00:13:02.271 --> 00:13:05.600
uh,
he was like,
you know,
I told him,
man,
just get all of the posts that you can,

201
00:13:05.601 --> 00:13:09.740
you know,
and was like,
what?
And he's like,
I told him,
you know,
there's this,

202
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:13.370
you got to get all the posts you can right now.
Yeah.
I was looking at him like,

203
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:14.630
dude,

204
00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:19.630
do you really think your fucking son once you to talk to him about all the pussy

205
00:13:19.911 --> 00:13:24.320
he can get?
No.
No kid wants to hear that from his dad.
No.
You know,

206
00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.670
let his uncle say that if,
if it's,
if someone has too,
but like,
yeah,
here's the,

207
00:13:28.671 --> 00:13:30.980
I have to fucking,
it's weird.
Yeah,

208
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.550
<v 3>it's weird.
It's wrong.</v>

209
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:37.410
I don't even like hearing sex jokes like from like parents shouldn't be telling

210
00:13:37.411 --> 00:13:41.610
sex jokes.
Somebody else's.
It's nasty as hell.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
No,
it's wrong.

211
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.680
It's totally,
could you imagine saying something to Lj?
Thank you.

212
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:48.540
Getting laid kid and like,
Eh,
no,
this is so wrong.

213
00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:53.450
<v 7>That whole thing down for like,
I'll talk like that crazy somebody else,</v>

214
00:13:53.451 --> 00:13:57.320
but not my own kid.
It's wrong.
Yeah.
I looked at the guy,
he was like,
right.

215
00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.500
And I remember,
I was like,
ah,
yeah,
no,
yeah,

216
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.680
good as much as you can.
And you can tell the kid was like,
hmm.

217
00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.470
He knew.
He knew he was a cute boy.
He's a good boy.
But he knew.
He knew that like,

218
00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.560
uh,
I didn't do this.
Yeah.
Yeah.

219
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.530
<v 3>Be Normal.
You just want them to be normal.
You folks just don't be gross.</v>

220
00:14:16.531 --> 00:14:18.480
Don't be,
when I was also a new guy,
right.

221
00:14:18.481 --> 00:14:22.770
I met them at this thing and here his dad's talking about some streaming pussy

222
00:14:22.771 --> 00:14:27.660
in front of them.
It's strange.
It's weird.
It's weird way to wait to do it.
Dad,

223
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:32.230
here's a fingernail question.
No,
I'm,
somebody wrote in there,

224
00:14:32.231 --> 00:14:34.290
what if you're dating someone for like six months and they're like,
hey,

225
00:14:34.291 --> 00:14:38.640
I need to tell you,
I used to have 12 inch fingernails,
obviously a deal breaker.

226
00:14:38.641 --> 00:14:42.000
When is the right time to tell us when you used to be a fucking maniac,

227
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.530
I think that you weighed on that.
You wait,
you sit on that knowledge.

228
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.400
But the fact that they used to be and now they're reformed.
Yeah,
it's fine.
Right.

229
00:14:50.401 --> 00:14:52.640
But you still want to give that away early.

230
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:57.230
He told Yo wait til the I love you's have been exchanged.
Yeah.
And there's like,

231
00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:02.060
if you have like a weird thing that you're even,
that you're into now.

232
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:07.110
I don't,
I'm not an advocate of sharing that upfront.
You just kinda no,

233
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.700
I'm saying like don't,
you don't have to introduce like a pissing my mouth.

234
00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:13.940
I'd love it.
You know,
like that's not a date.
One thing to introduce,

235
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:17.270
not a day one,
but soonish because why?
Well,

236
00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:21.410
because that way you weed out the ones that aren't going to do it.
You get it.

237
00:15:21.411 --> 00:15:23.390
You knock it out early.
Yeah.

238
00:15:23.391 --> 00:15:26.750
Not too early because it's not your sole identity.

239
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.570
So since this is not your identity,
you can,
I mean,

240
00:15:29.571 --> 00:15:33.380
if you're like all I do is drink piss and that's what I live by it.
Yeah.

241
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:35.960
Then you need to,
but if you're like,
that's kind of my thing.

242
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.100
You don't need to bring that up on the third day.
Do you Kinda want that?

243
00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.260
You want the girl to like you,
like you kind of want to rope her random,

244
00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:47.140
manipulate her a little bit more emotional named Thomas sacred like,
yeah.

245
00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:51.300
Tava hobbyists.
I hop out be like,

246
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.800
well you remember the other day when you're going to the bathroom and she's
like,

247
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.740
yeah,
I really wish you would have gone hi,
how much?
She's like,

248
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:02.720
wait what?
And then you're like,

249
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:08.060
well already but does it fit to fucking Fiji so I guess you're going to have to

250
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:09.420
piss in my mouth over there.

251
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:12.710
You're kind of manipulating the situation a little bit to me it sounds like.

252
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:13.820
Yeah,
that's what I'm suggesting.

253
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.360
Roping her in and then like eat what does free trip,
right?

254
00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.570
Then you got a penis in my mouth.
Yeah,
exactly.

255
00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.210
If you want to get away with something that weird,

256
00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.240
you've got to manipulate a little bit.
That's what I would,

257
00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:27.530
that's what a doctor would tell you to do.

258
00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:32.770
It's interesting or just be super rich like that also gives me an error status

259
00:16:33.171 --> 00:16:36.560
like that guy like garage in hammocks or whatever.
Shit.

260
00:16:36.561 --> 00:16:41.030
Through the Hammock in my mouth.
Apparently that's all you need is a few mil.

261
00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.230
And women are like,
okay.

262
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:46.340
I mean other than that being disgusting that that's fine because he was like,

263
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.230
I'll give you a hundred bucks a shit in my mouth.
And they were like,
all right.

264
00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:53.710
Even Steven.
Yeah.
Even Steve It,
there's no problem with that.
No,
I like it.

265
00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:58.150
I like the,
uh,
I like an honest exchange.
Yeah.
You know,
like I,

266
00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.520
we talked about this on the live show a little bit.

267
00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.790
[inaudible] was Hugh Hefner's death.
I don't,

268
00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:06.880
I don't think he was some great fucking pioneer.

269
00:17:06.881 --> 00:17:09.670
I think he was kind of a creeper and uh,

270
00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:14.260
he had a man should full of broken,
broken girls who he,
you know,

271
00:17:14.261 --> 00:17:16.840
he let live there for free,
but he didn't pay them.

272
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:21.290
He had like a weekly stipend and then it was a [inaudible] your movie where the,

273
00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:24.940
yeah.
And I silk pajamas and then,
uh,
he butt fucked a lot of them,

274
00:17:24.941 --> 00:17:28.300
but sexton cause he didn't want anyone pregnant.
It's true.
Breed breed.
Holly.

275
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.530
Holly Madison's book.
Fucking Huh?
Yes.
Discuss.
I can.
Such a power move.

276
00:17:32.531 --> 00:17:37.320
Like I know some people,
some people are certainly is.
It certainly is.

277
00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.410
I know women that are,
you know,

278
00:17:39.411 --> 00:17:44.080
very much into it for the physical sense.
I like that.

279
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.500
That's for them as euphoria.
Right.
Um,

280
00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.590
and there's obviously people who that's their sexual turn on,

281
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.000
but in and of itself,
like if you strip,

282
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:58.320
let's say someone's preferences to that away,
that's an aggressive move.
Yeah.

283
00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:04.050
It's a,
it's a dominant mood strike.
I'm going to fuck you and your ass.
Gosh,

284
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:10.260
it's so great.
Yeah.
Your butt hole is very sensitive and,
and put it comes down.

285
00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.270
My God,
you guys just show disgusting.
Yeah.
It's poop.

286
00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:17.010
Poop comes out of credit in that pervert.
He's like,
oh,
the big sexual revolution.

287
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:20.220
Yeah,
but it is still according to like a white guy's preference.

288
00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:25.290
Fucking though only blondes.
It was one type of woman that he liked.

289
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.040
It was like,
you know,
the cookie cutter,
big tits,
Pam Anderson,

290
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:31.050
if you had little hungry tits,
forget it.

291
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.270
He had a big ass forget it was like his way.

292
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:36.330
And I like Larry Flynt way better than that.

293
00:18:36.331 --> 00:18:41.060
We talked about pedaling Larry Flint just because it's honest.
He was like,

294
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:45.910
put that fucking candle holder in your place,
right?
You want $100?
Yeah,
spread it.

295
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.333
Great.

296
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.800
You put your hand further up there and there's no horse shit.

297
00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:56.180
Mystique of the mansion and living with Hefner.
And he was a real,

298
00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:01.980
when it was just like,
look,
I'm a pig,
he's a pig.
PERV and it's an even exchange.

299
00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:03.810
Here's some cash spread your beef.

300
00:19:03.811 --> 00:19:08.070
And there was no convoluted thing of like how many girlfriends does a guy have

301
00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:13.030
on a bus?
My goal wheelchair real quick.
Well and he said to like,

302
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:16.200
well Holly said in her book that they,
he would be like,
all right,

303
00:19:16.201 --> 00:19:20.970
you too make out.
And then they'd make out and he,
you know,
jerk it.
That's cool.

304
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.330
And then they'd throw like the new girl at him so that they were off the hook

305
00:19:24.331 --> 00:19:27.190
for the night.
My you deal with him?
Yeah.

306
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:30.210
How about though you got half tonight and she's like,
oh,
it was cool.

307
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:36.330
It kept fucking my butt though.
Yeah,
that's what he does.
What he does.
Not Grad.

308
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:41.910
He's 92 today.
It's exciting and I like your great,
great grandpa

309
00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:47.910
and I and I and last night with the live show and people were like,
yeah,

310
00:19:47.911 --> 00:19:50.250
it's great exposure.
Okay,
well you think about it.

311
00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.760
Let's think about the stars that really came out of playboy.

312
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.900
You had your Pamela Anderson,
that's the anomaly.
I think she,

313
00:19:56.901 --> 00:20:01.090
she was apparently Anderson as a genuine,
like an icon.
She's Canadian but,

314
00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.720
but became an American icon.

315
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:10.520
Maybe Jenny McCarthy.
She was famous before she did it.
She was,
you know,

316
00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.720
but other than that,
I mean,
who's,

317
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.930
who's really stuck home and electro appointment yet,

318
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:20.580
but she was also fucking prints and yeah,
no,
she was just a chicken or the egg.

319
00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:25.530
Where you a whole before,
you know?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.

320
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.820
I don't,
I don't,
I just,
I just,
when he died I was like,
it was funny too,

321
00:20:29.821 --> 00:20:33.030
Holly was saying that the mansion was all run down and shit too.
She's like,

322
00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:35.900
it's not nice that she has oldest,
you know,

323
00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:37.920
they put in bunk beds and the playmates rooms.

324
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.980
Why you would give up on keeping it like super nice.

325
00:20:42.981 --> 00:20:46.620
Cause it's expensive.
I'm sure he's got the money.
Yeah.

326
00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:50.300
Read the grotto and they're like,
Hey,
do you want new carpets?
And everyone?

327
00:20:50.301 --> 00:20:52.480
He's like,
how am I says um,

328
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.370
it's $3,000 that's a lot of ammonium

329
00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:01.840
leave the old carpet.
Okay.
Half.
I don't think,

330
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:06.720
I don't think there's playboys cellar box.
Somebody in the Bot right now.

331
00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.160
Okay.
We'll get the new girl down here immediately.

332
00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:13.240
But don't you imagine that once the Internet started that who the heck is even

333
00:21:13.241 --> 00:21:17.110
looking at playboy?
Oh,
of course.
When you can see everything.
Yeah.

334
00:21:17.111 --> 00:21:21.790
Like no one's buying that shit for the last 20 years.
I mean,
when I was a kid,

335
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.540
obviously there's no internet and the magazine was just tits.

336
00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:28.510
That's the one thing that was kind of Nice.
Right?
Cause you were excited by that.

337
00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:32.530
You're excited by seeing some Bush,
right?
You're like,
oh,

338
00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.950
and just like a beautiful body.
Yeah,
man,
that's,

339
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.120
I'm going to jerk off to this right now.
And then the internet ruined.

340
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:45.070
Desensitized.
You're completely,
yeah,
we were like a naked body.

341
00:21:45.071 --> 00:21:48.460
So what can I do?
Can I,
can we stab it?

342
00:21:48.461 --> 00:21:51.840
Can we put it in a toilet bowl?
Why didn't she crying more?

343
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.070
And she gagging,
choking.

344
00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.130
I put my fist down or oh it's gotta be

345
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.400
at gotta get hard on with that.
Isn't that funny?
It's so funny.

346
00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:10.570
It's really crazy man.
Yeah.
I guess my only beef too is like,

347
00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:15.390
I always want to see women exploiting other women.
Making the money,

348
00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.920
make the money.
If you're going to exploit the women,

349
00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:20.740
at least give them the fucking,
the money.
Dickhead.

350
00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:26.590
Make that money.
Come on slides,
make your own stuff.
You know,

351
00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:30.280
cause it all boils down to the finances.
Dude.
He's got the power.

352
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.610
They don't have the power sucks.
I think these days I'm not,

353
00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:38.230
I mean I don't know the specifics,
the names and all that.
Typically the things,

354
00:22:38.231 --> 00:22:39.400
but there's definitely some women,

355
00:22:39.401 --> 00:22:43.780
I think doing some producing some kind of plan.
And I'm,

356
00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.220
listen,
there's two sides to this debate.
And,
and,
and when women's world,

357
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:53.080
there are girls who find being naked,
very empowering and very awesome.

358
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.480
And then there are other women that just are like,
it's not for me,

359
00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.090
it's just not for me personally.

360
00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.820
But I understand why some women think it's a great thing to do.

361
00:23:00.821 --> 00:23:03.070
It feels good to them.
Want,
feel powerful,

362
00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:07.030
then you know more and more power to you.
But sure.
I think that guys,

363
00:23:07.031 --> 00:23:11.800
if a creeper,
yeah,
all it is.
Hell,
he's super old.

364
00:23:11.801 --> 00:23:16.170
How old was he when he died?
It was like over 90 damn good in here.

365
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.100
I would think it's even grosser.
Just asleep next to him.
He'd be like,

366
00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:24.020
these are all just old smelling and your body's just,
you know,

367
00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:28.020
just falling apart.
Literally decaying.
Yeah.
And like,
you know,

368
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:32.680
the muscle has gone and your face and you know,

369
00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.430
like he probably,
he was like,
ah,
and be like,
you all right.
He's a,

370
00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.900
that's what it sounds like when I breathe.
They're like,
oh my God,

371
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.650
I'm going to sleep next to you.
Yeah.
But that's why his up.

372
00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.710
Fuck you in the morning.

373
00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:50.180
I gotta take my shot and I'll fuck you in the button in the morning.
Okay.

374
00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:54.170
That's why the house was so damn old.

375
00:23:54.171 --> 00:23:56.260
You know how old people's houses look like them?

376
00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:00.110
They start to smell and you're like,
that's broken.
And they're like,

377
00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:04.430
that's what I'm saying.
Like somebody else should have been like,

378
00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.640
I'm going to run this,
keep this house pristine.

379
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.890
His daughter took over the dealings of the magazine and the pro waste money on

380
00:24:12.891 --> 00:24:14.470
his house.
He's a old piece of shit.

381
00:24:14.471 --> 00:24:17.270
It's going to die and then we're going to kick out all these sluts and then I'm

382
00:24:17.271 --> 00:24:19.810
going to take over Saudi.
Think what you think of the house is.

383
00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:22.890
I think the house is like the property's worth a lot.
The house is probably,

384
00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.920
I think of it,
the house was probably dog shit,

385
00:24:24.921 --> 00:24:29.570
but then it's like what's the house worth in terms of its significance?

386
00:24:29.571 --> 00:24:33.680
In other words,
you know the historical value of it being the playboy mansion,

387
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:36.050
all the aids that's been transferred in that house.

388
00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:41.110
All the herpes and gonorrhea that had been transmitted.
The grotto.
Yeah.

389
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:42.680
Can you think of anything?
Grocer

390
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:49.360
girls on the road,
I'll blah,
blah,
fuck from at,

391
00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:54.830
I mean Larry Flint.
I feel like it was just straight forward and,
and you know,

392
00:24:54.831 --> 00:24:57.830
didn't,
yeah.
Send the girls and you know that girls can't say no.

393
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.640
No one's saying no.
Why couldn't it just be an even?

394
00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:04.040
People said no over the years.

395
00:25:04.041 --> 00:25:06.860
And I was definitely the day you found your shit right up.
Yeah.

396
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.770
You should be out of here,
which is terrible.
Like that's a Harem then you're,

397
00:25:09.771 --> 00:25:13.670
you're keeping women hostage.
You're not,
uh,
it's not an,
it's not a fair exchange.

398
00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:18.320
No.
You know,
this ongoing hostage situation.
Yeah.
If you don't do it,

399
00:25:18.321 --> 00:25:21.470
then you're homeless.
It's fucking terrible.
Unreal.

400
00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.880
And people think he's a big hero,
this fucking asshole.
I mean,
I get,
look,

401
00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:28.220
he's a great entrepreneur.
He built an empire.

402
00:25:28.221 --> 00:25:31.700
Everyone respects that in this country.
But gaberdine by the way,

403
00:25:31.701 --> 00:25:35.520
how do you feel about this or shower farts?
The safest.
Huh?

404
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:38.840
Um,
someone said it before in the shower.

405
00:25:38.841 --> 00:25:41.260
He never had the fear that Brown is running down.
You know,

406
00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:42.500
it feels like a little extra.

407
00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:45.060
You're close enough to the toilet or you can just stop it down.

408
00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:49.910
So it's the trouble of Brown yourself is now removed is a stupid one question.

409
00:25:49.911 --> 00:25:52.590
I know,
but I don't understand why we're doing it.
It's just,

410
00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:56.810
it's in my emails and just brought it up.
Now I shower.
Fart is not this.

411
00:25:56.811 --> 00:26:00.110
I know what the thinking is that if I fart in the shower,

412
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.140
then there's a brown comes down.
I can just put it through the drain.

413
00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.250
That's silly.
The safest far the only safe farts or on the toilet.

414
00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.940
Everybody knows this.
Yeah,
that's true.
That's the safest place you can fart.

415
00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.450
It's true.
Why would you just don't go just do it on the toilet.

416
00:26:14.451 --> 00:26:17.810
Don't go in the shower yet.
Yeah.
But if you have one in the shower,

417
00:26:17.811 --> 00:26:21.280
they're saying,
do you let it out?
Of course.
Yeah.
That's,
that's the,

418
00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:25.400
that's the whole reason you live.
You take the gamble on a far like that.

419
00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:29.850
You're talking about gambling.
Um,
here's a colonoscopy.

420
00:26:29.851 --> 00:26:33.200
Before I tried to play it at the live show,
but it's really a studio piece.

421
00:26:33.201 --> 00:26:36.860
I think this is a lady Postcoloniali a piece.

422
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:51.390
She really gave me a proper,
oh my gosh.
Oh my gosh.

423
00:26:51.391 --> 00:26:55.500
That's like old school.
So you know,
no girl,

424
00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:01.890
I don't know.
Oh my God.

425
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:05.490
That's classic when you Omg,

426
00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:11.370
Omg and she looks like the Moose Suit Lady,
which is neat too.
You think she does?

427
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:13.350
That's not very nice

428
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.940
lady.
After she had a call and asking me for

429
00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.240
what I'm trying to figure out,
is this somebody who did the Oh,
um,
oh my gosh.

430
00:27:27.241 --> 00:27:31.900
For the show or is that just a coincidence?
In other words,
yeah.

431
00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:37.690
Michelle,
I think it might.
Maybe the lady recording.
I'm saying,
Oh,
maybe.

432
00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:42.000
And she goes,
no,
no.
The lady that recorded said it.
Oh,

433
00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:43.103
you know what I mean?

434
00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:53.610
Yeah.
I guess it's,
you know,
it's fun thing to do.
Yeah.

435
00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:57.410
She's got that smoker's laugh.
Yeah,
she does.
She does cheese,

436
00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:58.560
moose soup on the regular,

437
00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:06.460
uh,
uh,

438
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:11.970
a Siamese twin question.
Is this good?
I was wondering if Simon,

439
00:28:11.971 --> 00:28:13.560
he's conjoined twin murders,

440
00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:18.360
if somewhere was the other twin vehemently process protesting and trying to stop

441
00:28:18.361 --> 00:28:21.060
the murder.
How has the guilty twins sent to jail?

442
00:28:21.061 --> 00:28:25.500
Assuming they can't be separated?
That's an interesting question.
So to be clear,

443
00:28:25.501 --> 00:28:28.500
they're saying conjoined twins.
One of them is like,

444
00:28:28.501 --> 00:28:31.820
I'm going to kill this person either.
I was like,
you can't fucking do that.
Right.

445
00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:34.740
What do you do at that point?
As far as punishment,

446
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.830
but then that they both have to go to prison.
Well,

447
00:28:37.831 --> 00:28:42.240
how is that fair to the one who's like,
I objected.
It's not fair.
Life's not fair.

448
00:28:42.241 --> 00:28:46.020
They were born conjoined twins.
Their whole existence isn't fair.
I don't know.

449
00:28:46.021 --> 00:28:49.820
I think they would have a really strong case to keep the,
the,

450
00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.120
the guilty one free.

451
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:55.690
Here's solution ankle bracelet on the guilty one so that the,

452
00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:59.400
the good one can lead their life and then,
but no,

453
00:28:59.401 --> 00:29:02.040
here's what does the court will say,
you should've called the police.

454
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:05.190
Why didn't she got to go further than that?
That he's going to be like,

455
00:29:05.191 --> 00:29:08.520
I tried and then he fucking threw the phone down and I was,

456
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.390
I was pulling his arm away and he was insisting on,
you know,

457
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.830
you're the murder champion.
You tell me what happened.

458
00:29:13.831 --> 00:29:16.920
I'm talking about the ramifications,
not the actual murder itself,

459
00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:21.660
but you've seen enough sentencing shows and murder shows you word the court's

460
00:29:21.661 --> 00:29:24.240
lien.
I don't know.
I think that I've never heard a case like this.

461
00:29:24.241 --> 00:29:25.860
This is what would be so exciting about it,

462
00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.290
is that it would be a whole new field,

463
00:29:28.291 --> 00:29:33.240
a whole new arena within crimes and punishment.

464
00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:34.890
Let me terrible,

465
00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:38.550
I imagine they put the bad one in prison and then the good one just gets to like

466
00:29:38.551 --> 00:29:41.910
watch TV and eat real food in the,
maybe like,

467
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:46.630
like they divide the cell in half.
And I'm like,
no,
this has to go for a walk.

468
00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:47.800
That person,

469
00:29:47.801 --> 00:29:51.940
those people that are conjoined are either free or they're locked up now.
I know.

470
00:29:51.941 --> 00:29:53.500
You'd be really,
I mean,

471
00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:58.180
it's completely unfair to the other person in either scenario.
It's fucked up,

472
00:29:58.181 --> 00:30:03.150
man.
The whole thing is fucked up.
Yeah.
Very fucked up.
It's not cool.

473
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.700
I hate to be a conjoined twin.
That's gotta be the worst,
by the way.

474
00:30:06.701 --> 00:30:09.550
We were talking about just what do you,
how do you feel about this?
Um,

475
00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:13.740
did you read any of the Harvey Weinstein stuff?
Yeah,
I mean,
I,
uh,

476
00:30:13.741 --> 00:30:17.170
I did so great.
It's so funny because people that don't know

477
00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:18.650
<v 7>introduce you,</v>

478
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:22.900
that is Harvey Weinstein founded a Miramax,

479
00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:28.090
the film production,
the playboy,
the film industry,

480
00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:32.560
and a Miramax eventually sold to Disney.
And then,

481
00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.390
um,
he started,

482
00:30:34.391 --> 00:30:38.800
he founded the Weinstein company with his brother and their,
you know,

483
00:30:38.801 --> 00:30:41.740
their big time,
Hollywood producers.
What they are,
they make movies.

484
00:30:41.741 --> 00:30:45.340
There are movie producers.
They,
you know,
his early stuff was like,
he,

485
00:30:45.341 --> 00:30:49.120
he did all of Quentin Tarantino stuff.
So he did pulp fiction.

486
00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:52.990
He's done the whole Tarantino catalog.
He did clerks.

487
00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:57.340
He's done a bunch of Matt Damon movies.
I mean,
there,

488
00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:00.820
he's big time.
So you look at Harvey Weinstein and

489
00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:04.490
<v 3>the Weinstein Company,
you see that every time.
Every movie,
right?
Yeah.</v>

490
00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:08.750
<v 7>So it used to be Miramax,
which was his,
um,
let's see.</v>

491
00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:12.260
Let me just to give you,
I mean,
I want to give you like a full,

492
00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:16.460
a full,
you know,
uh,
idea of

493
00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:21.050
<v 3>what'd you use to get those fart?
Mike's installed,
you know,</v>

494
00:31:21.051 --> 00:31:25.610
is that just a pipe dream?
You have to like a double side.
His,
his,
um,

495
00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:30.350
imtp.
Yeah,
it's not even like one list of things.
It is.
It's just every,

496
00:31:30.351 --> 00:31:32.180
every movie this guy did.

497
00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:36.940
<v 7>It's so many movies,
man.
Um,
let's,
I'm trying to look for like the,</v>

498
00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:41.950
the huge wow Mandela thing here.
Oh,
the Butler,

499
00:31:41.951 --> 00:31:46.090
I think that won an Oscar.
Um,
let's see.

500
00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:47.353
Uh,

501
00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:52.950
<v 3>Django unchained silver linings playbook.
Oh,
that was that one.
Good.</v>

502
00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:57.370
One big.
And you know me,
I love that show.
I miss her and she rest in peace,

503
00:31:57.371 --> 00:31:58.204
but yeah.

504
00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:02.920
<v 7>Scream all good things.
The fighter,
the king's speech,
I think that won an Oscar,</v>

505
00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:07.900
or at least the actor one.
Um,
all right,

506
00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:08.710
well,
you get the point.

507
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:13.710
It's dozens and literally dozens and hundreds of movies is what he's produced.

508
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:17.230
Hundreds of movies.
Um,
anyways,

509
00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:21.050
so it just came out that he,
uh,

510
00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:26.350
has been sexually harassing.
I guess it's like a big open Hollywood secret.

511
00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:31.480
He's been sexually harassing,
harassing women for years.

512
00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:35.650
Everyone from interns to actresses to coworkers,
uh,

513
00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:40.310
all these people,
he's had eight settlements.
Um,
yeah.

514
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:44.270
Then he released the weirdest statement where he was like,

515
00:32:44.271 --> 00:32:47.780
I didn't behave the way I should have.

516
00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:51.630
I'm working on that.
Um,
and uh,

517
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.250
now I'm going to go after the NRA like a total,

518
00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:57.670
<v 3>no,
he took time off.
Don't know.
Is this before the NRA?</v>

519
00:32:57.671 --> 00:33:00.130
He takes time off right now and now he just distracting.

520
00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:04.890
<v 7>But with the NRA stuff,
that's total bullshit.
Nonsensical thing to do.</v>

521
00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:08.760
It's saying,
don't be mad like you're mad at me for doing this thing,

522
00:33:08.761 --> 00:33:09.660
but guess what I'm going to do?

523
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.670
I'm going to do something that you can get behind.

524
00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:17.040
I'm going to go after the NRA fucking absolute nonsense.
And if you fall,

525
00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.640
you know he wants you to fall for that.
Like,
well,
he's going to go out.

526
00:33:20.641 --> 00:33:23.070
He's going to go after these gun lobbyists.

527
00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:26.990
It's too just to get you to not think about smoking mirrors.
Guys.

528
00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.090
After that was released,

529
00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:35.180
more women came forward and then a couple where it wasn't like,

530
00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:39.390
like where he cornered someone jerked off in a plant,

531
00:33:39.391 --> 00:33:41.070
in a restaurant and then,

532
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.650
and then a couple others and then the board of directors at that company fired

533
00:33:46.651 --> 00:33:50.370
him because it finally went public.
Yeah,
they,

534
00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:54.630
of course everybody knew.
They knew no one gave a shit until it was made public.

535
00:33:54.631 --> 00:33:58.110
And then of course,
be held accountable.
But anyway,

536
00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:01.800
I mean,
if you're going to get into the movie producing business,

537
00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:04.680
there's no way you get into it in front of people.

538
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:08.000
<v 3>Well,
especially if you're a a,
you know,</v>

539
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:09.830
he's not an attractive guy.

540
00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:13.250
He's kind of nebbishy looking old.

541
00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:17.570
Nebbishy I'm attractive.
That's why you become a big movie producer.

542
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:20.570
So you can be like,
look,
do you want a part in this movie?

543
00:34:20.571 --> 00:34:21.500
You got to suck my stuff.

544
00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:26.470
I have come all over my face and now you have a part in a movie.
Right?
But,

545
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:30.620
but now here's the thing.
I honestly think that's an even exchange,

546
00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:34.610
which is which one,
which is,
hey,
if you suck my stuff,

547
00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:38.030
you get to be a star in my movie.
And then the girl that,
yeah,

548
00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:40.580
that's totally fine.
Of course,

549
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:44.570
because this is what this is fucking show business is the most corrupt and

550
00:34:44.571 --> 00:34:49.350
stupid thing in the,
in the world.
Uh,
and that,
that's just how it is.

551
00:34:49.351 --> 00:34:52.710
Are you saying he was on sleep bill each other every day in this business for

552
00:34:52.711 --> 00:34:57.630
advantage of course.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
but I,

553
00:34:57.631 --> 00:35:02.300
I feel like it's at least a more honest way of dealing with shit.

554
00:35:02.301 --> 00:35:04.310
Like in our business,
everything else is such bullshit.

555
00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:08.300
Like sometimes I kind of wish someone had been like,
look,
do you fucking,

556
00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:10.730
you want this deal?
I'd be like,
yeah,
we don't have to do for it.

557
00:35:10.731 --> 00:35:14.180
And you just gotta I got drop off in this plant and you got to watch like,
okay,

558
00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:17.590
that's it.
And then we're straight though.
Everything's like on on level.
Yeah.

559
00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.720
It's a,
it's a way more honest way of doing things.

560
00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.650
I know it doesn't take as long to if somebody would offer.
Yeah,

561
00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:29.150
it's a struggle all these years.
That's what I'm saying.
Get a special,

562
00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:33.060
that's why I wasn't fucking took me so long to cook.
I was like,
who's,

563
00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:37.710
I just show me the Dick.
I know who,
who are Netflix?
Did you know who was big?

564
00:35:37.711 --> 00:35:41.310
It can go,
yeah,
right here.
I would have done it ages ago instead.

565
00:35:41.311 --> 00:35:45.330
This a clean system of,
you know,
normal deals and this and that.
I,

566
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:50.100
yeah,
didn't Sam,
maybe you,

567
00:35:50.101 --> 00:35:53.960
but you wouldn't say no.
Would you know,
I would've been like,
yeah,
do it.
But

568
00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:01.770
there's this guy,
he said he's going to make us special for me.
Look Great.

569
00:36:01.771 --> 00:36:06.110
And you'd be like,
he's got a check off like on me or telling me like,
yeah,
do it.

570
00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:10.260
But who is it?
Is it like a big producer?
Like a big producer?
Yeah,
yeah,
of course.

571
00:36:10.261 --> 00:36:13.590
Yeah.
But then,
then you're out.
Then the deal is like,
again,

572
00:36:13.591 --> 00:36:16.980
it's the Larry Flynt School of business where it's like,
it's a,
it's a,

573
00:36:16.981 --> 00:36:19.290
it's a contract.
Look,
I went to law school for two weeks.

574
00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:23.490
Here's what I learned to contract is an exchange of something for something
else.

575
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:27.600
Right.
Very cut and dry.
Right.
You give the guy a hand job,

576
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:31.380
you get a part in the movie.
It's so fucking clean.
I can't that happen more.

577
00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:34.680
I am sure it does to,
I mean,
I feel like a part in a movie.
What,
who do I have to,

578
00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:39.720
I know,
right?
What she was attracted to me,
I would have done it.
He's not,

579
00:36:39.721 --> 00:36:44.280
he's in the,
he's in the pretty girls.
How about like 41 year old moms even mushy.

580
00:36:44.281 --> 00:36:48.800
Perps for sure.
Yeah,
for sure.
And I love how you know the look,

581
00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:53.990
Hollywood has never been known for being a non corrupt horse shit business.

582
00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.390
You know,
like actresses are like,
I can't believe it.

583
00:36:57.391 --> 00:37:01.470
He invited me to his hotel room.
Why did you go to his hotel room a lot?
Like,

584
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:05.850
you know what I mean?
You think that was where the business deal happens?

585
00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:09.150
Come on up.
Yeah,
I'll go there.
I actually,

586
00:37:09.151 --> 00:37:12.870
Judd came out and she said that it was a weird,
you know,
she goes,

587
00:37:12.871 --> 00:37:16.290
I went to the hotel to meet him and then like come up to go up to the suite and

588
00:37:16.291 --> 00:37:19.260
he was like,
she was like,
okay.
And then he was in his robe.

589
00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:24.060
It's like she had to bullshit to get out of there before we get she's,

590
00:37:24.061 --> 00:37:28.560
and she's a legit talent.
She doesn't need to suck his Dick Dick.

591
00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:33.590
No,
of course not.
No.
But yeah,
I mean,
he's a,

592
00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:37.650
he's out.
He's out now.
And there's so many other dudes doing that and stuff.

593
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:42.430
Oh yeah.
A lot of guys do that.

594
00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:47.550
A lot of guys forcing their dick and balls on you.
That's the thing.

595
00:37:47.551 --> 00:37:50.190
The world is always going to be full of creepers.
I mean,

596
00:37:50.191 --> 00:37:55.020
I hope to some extent we can wait him out by shaming them like we are now in a

597
00:37:55.021 --> 00:37:57.240
position of power is scary though.
It's all,

598
00:37:57.241 --> 00:38:01.620
they're always going to be dudes that are powerful or going to,

599
00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:06.480
some of them are going to be used that I know it's too bad creepers.

600
00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:09.710
So a lot of people out there know,
um,

601
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:12.720
refer to me and understand that I'm the hat comic.

602
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:17.750
But then yesterday someone decided to be a swagger Jagger and a cracker jack or

603
00:38:17.851 --> 00:38:19.260
did you come up with that and no,

604
00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:23.450
but I you can see that,
um,

605
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:27.090
it looks so much better on me.
You were clowning me and you were just like,
oh,

606
00:38:27.091 --> 00:38:28.860
I can't believe you're wearing crazy hats.

607
00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:33.450
And then all of a sudden now the swagger jacker in charge.

608
00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.690
So if my bear hat called this style soccer,
yeah.

609
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:42.040
And Josh gave this to you last night at the Pod,

610
00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:45.370
but the problem is your head is too big.
Let's show them what it looks like.

611
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:47.770
It looks so good on me.
See,
first I was looking at me.

612
00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:51.580
Look how good I look and look at it.
It looks like a baby hat.

613
00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:57.210
Looks like a toddler hat.
Yeah,
no,
it's looks terrible.
Yeah.

614
00:38:57.430 --> 00:39:02.240
So this was his grandfather's hat.
Yeah,
I was bear Bryant.
Yeah,

615
00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:08.440
but I mean like,
it fits my persona.
And then you're like,
what about me?

616
00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:13.130
Thank you.
The hat person now.
Oh,
I thought you were ragging on that person.

617
00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:18.100
You're like,
ah,
I'll,
I'll do it.
I'll be the hat.
Not that it's that,

618
00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:19.880
that hat looks terrible on you.
Okay.

619
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:25.030
This hallux songs better look how much better would the cargo on it.

620
00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.560
That looks good on you though,
on the Taco hat guy.
You don't know who gave us.

621
00:39:29.561 --> 00:39:30.040
To me,

622
00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:34.540
it was either given to me by the Taco people in Houston that came and gave us a

623
00:39:34.541 --> 00:39:38.830
bunch of Tacos,
or I feel like maybe Richard Franco,
the,
uh,

624
00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:43.330
competitive eater gave it to me.
Maybe I'm confused.
But James Franco,

625
00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:46.570
James Franco,
the actor.
Yeah,
he gave it to me.

626
00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:50.500
I just feel like baseball caps look good on you.
Yeah,

627
00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:54.310
but advanced hats like the one I'm wearing.
Yeah,
don't look good on you.

628
00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:58.860
This is like a varsity level hat and that's for you.
Yeah.

629
00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:02.500
I don't wear hats,
but this one I will because look how nice it looks,

630
00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:06.760
but look how good I look in the roll tide.
You're going to say that I don't,

631
00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:11.110
I don't subscribe to that.
I don't.
I don't say that.
The hat you're wearing,

632
00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:14.800
this is not an Alabama football team hat.

633
00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:18.690
That's 100% in Alabama football team at human to show you.
Okay.

634
00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:21.900
It's a called a fedora hat and you don't understand anything.

635
00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:28.590
This is worn by Justin Timberlake.
He likes these hats.
They roll tide hat.

636
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:30.070
Okay.
I don't,

637
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:35.260
you mean that the only people that wear these or roll tide people?
Yes.
Oh my God.

638
00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:41.260
I look like that old man or this all guy.
That's the same guy.
That's his hat.

639
00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.720
And you,
oh my God.

640
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:46.330
The famous head coach,

641
00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:51.430
former head coach of the Alabama Crimson tide.
See Alabama on it.
See,

642
00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:54.940
so he made this popular,
this style 100%.

643
00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:58.090
I Wa he's got good taste and so do I.
Okay,

644
00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:01.700
so now we say it rolled the died.
No nuts.

645
00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:05.890
No rolling tides.
There you go.
Jesus.

646
00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:09.370
Unbelievable.
How old is that guy?
Well,

647
00:41:09.371 --> 00:41:13.330
he's very dead but I don't know.
It was,
yeah,

648
00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.990
so he started it and I'm carrying the tradition.
You're carrying it on.
Yeah.

649
00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:21.640
You're the person.
The one qualified.
I definitely looked great in his hat.

650
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:24.940
You definitely do actually fits you well.
Yeah.

651
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.850
Cause I'm cool Justin Timberlake too.
You're not cool.

652
00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:32.870
I'm so much cooler than you.
What are you looking at?
Who's texting you?

653
00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:34.130
Sexting is a big group

654
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:38.330
<v 7>text going on right now about the bet.
And um,</v>

655
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.610
apparently Arie and his podcast said he like,

656
00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.990
I guess he had said something about not doing some poses so that,
you know,

657
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:49.370
Joe called him out and said,
are you not doing all the poses?

658
00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:55.100
Area was very defensive.
Burt's real excited that his,
uh,

659
00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:59.750
sitting heart rate is resting heart rate is 47.

660
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:04.760
Um,
but anyways,
I um,

661
00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:08.900
but he also takes like blood pressure medication which lowers your heart rate.

662
00:42:08.901 --> 00:42:09.734
So he doesn't even,

663
00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:15.370
she's just so he's taking stuff to to alter it,
isn't it?
Yeah.

664
00:42:15.371 --> 00:42:19.220
Yeah.
And then he's like,
well it's really low.
Well,
delusional,

665
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:21.800
you're manipulating it.
Didn't you didn't think about that.

666
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:25.310
What's your resting heart rate d now it's actually lower.
Yeah,

667
00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.070
but you've always had like no pulse.

668
00:42:28.071 --> 00:42:31.910
My resting heart rate is so low that they,

669
00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:35.210
my physician sent me to a cardiologist.

670
00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:39.890
The cardiologist sent me to Cedars Imaging Institute and they were like,

671
00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:43.490
that's,
you know,
I even used to talk about it in my act and they were like,

672
00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:47.140
so did you use to run marathons or something?
Cause sure.
My,

673
00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:51.020
my resting heart rate usually between 36 and 44.

674
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:52.333
So that's like,

675
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:56.660
you either have like something wrong or you have like a really strong heart,

676
00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.810
right?
Like that's like elite.
Their hearts don't have to work as much.

677
00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:02.120
I've heard your heart.
I put my head on your chest.

678
00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:08.510
<v 8>Du,
Du,
Du,
Du.</v>

679
00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:13.580
<v 7>It's practically dead.
Well,
I went away for 10 years.
I had every test run.</v>

680
00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:18.530
I mean like I think $30,000 worth of tests done.

681
00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:22.400
This is a few years ago and at the end with like with,
after all,

682
00:43:22.401 --> 00:43:27.080
it's multiple days of going,
injecting me with things have me run on treadmills,

683
00:43:27.081 --> 00:43:30.470
all that stuff.
They're like,
oh,
it's got a strong heart.
I was like,

684
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:34.910
that's the conclusion and be like,
yeah,
okay.
That was it.

685
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:38.700
I hope so.
I hope it is that you just have a superior,
I mean I,

686
00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:43.550
I did the test you've gone to where they do like the ultrasound and you can see

687
00:43:43.551 --> 00:43:45.740
it and cedars imaging institute,

688
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:48.770
like it was a full like multi day,

689
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:55.150
10 years ago.
No,
I went more recently.
He did?
Yeah.
Okay.

690
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:56.840
I also had the um,

691
00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:02.420
the cardiac calcium test done where they score basically.

692
00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:05.150
It's like a,
basically like a plaque test.

693
00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:10.130
10 to zero to a hundred.
Yeah,
the zero.

694
00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:14.570
That's a great gun.
I don't want to lose you yet.

695
00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:19.350
I'm not going anywhere.
What I do?
Hey Man,

696
00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:24.650
I'll be right here,
you know?
Yeah,

697
00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:29.480
Thanks.
Yeah.
Um,
this is always adorable.

698
00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:31.350
The kids say the darndest things,
you know,

699
00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:37.490
<v 9>do points in the 20s and near 30 degrees across central Mississippi.
Well,</v>

700
00:44:37.491 --> 00:44:40.730
hey there,
what's going on with Zane?
Doesn't know.

701
00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:44.563
Sure.

702
00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:48.960
<v 7>Wait,
someone's kid,
but check this out.
This is fine.</v>

703
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:49.833
<v 9>Fantastic.
Well,</v>

704
00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:54.850
we've got a little bit of a interesting things going on right now.

705
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.070
I want to point out the weather right now.
Yeah.

706
00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:08.020
<v 3>There are parts everywhere.
I like that kid.
Yeah.
It was that our son.</v>

707
00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:10.650
I wish that I would,
I wish I had been watching the news when that happened.

708
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:14.530
That would make my day 100%.
I mean,
to watch that kid,

709
00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.840
what's the ratings go through the roof and they hire that kid to do it through

710
00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:24.610
the news parts everywhere and there's tutes and it's going to rain today.

711
00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:28.650
What could be better news on it?
I've loved that.
Yeah.

712
00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:32.680
I wish that would do that too.
To everywhere.

713
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.650
Fantastic.
Yeah.
No,
I love it.

714
00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:39.900
What's the deal with weathermen anyways?
I mean would,

715
00:45:39.901 --> 00:45:42.310
do we even need them anymore,
you know,
guys,

716
00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:46.540
<v 7>what's the,
why are the two or too,
that's why,</v>

717
00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:52.970
um,
do you remember a while back we did the,
uh,

718
00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:57.320
the Juggalo episode?
Yes.

719
00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:02.830
<v 3>Yes.
What do you remember about it?
Well,
the fans are very unique.</v>

720
00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:06.910
Um,
they tend to attract,
they tried a lot of people.
It's a,

721
00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.010
it's a very accepting community.

722
00:46:09.011 --> 00:46:14.011
It's like a catchall community and there's a little bit of mental illness in

723
00:46:14.441 --> 00:46:17.560
that community.
I'd say some drug use,

724
00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:21.910
but I think overall it's a positive theme.

725
00:46:21.911 --> 00:46:26.620
Like the whole thing is like being accepting.
Yeah.
They were pretty accepting.

726
00:46:26.621 --> 00:46:28.780
Yeah.
Um,
it was like a nice theme.

727
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:32.510
<v 7>There was a lot of like tattoos,</v>

728
00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:37.460
<v 3>right?
Face painting and yeah.
A lot of face painting as part of the culture.</v>

729
00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:41.570
I think a high sugar diet seems to be part of culture too.

730
00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:44.990
A lot of car bloating.
Yeah.
I mean that's just,

731
00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:47.240
I didn't see any verification other than

732
00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:52.170
<v 7>faces,
but um,
it felt like that was kind of a theme.
You know,</v>

733
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:55.600
sugar,
sugar seemed like it was a theme to me.
I Dunno if I'm wrong,

734
00:46:56.870 --> 00:47:00.450
it really felt very much like that.
Um,

735
00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:05.450
so anyways,
we uh,
you know the,
the Juggalos follow the uh,

736
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:09.150
ICP bro,
insane clown posse.
Right.
Um,

737
00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:12.360
there was a few people that wrote in and told us that they were,

738
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:18.200
they used to be Juggalos are they used to follow ICP and told us a little bit

739
00:47:19.531 --> 00:47:20.100
about,
you know,

740
00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:23.670
what you were talking about that it was accepting it was something to do as a

741
00:47:23.671 --> 00:47:24.400
place to go.

742
00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:28.960
<v 3>They're very successful.
They,
they've got a lot of ICP.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Excuse me.</v>

743
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.590
I think there was some discussion of like buying an island or something and

744
00:47:32.591 --> 00:47:37.450
having a central location for like all the Juggalos to meet and you know,

745
00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:40.780
like,
like Margaritaville kind of thing like with Jimmy Buffet.
Right.

746
00:47:40.781 --> 00:47:42.730
So all the fans can be together cause they had,

747
00:47:42.731 --> 00:47:47.500
when they have their big get togethers it is huge turnout.
Yeah.
Yeah.

748
00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:48.550
Oh yeah.
Huge.

749
00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:49.723
<v 10>Uh,</v>

750
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:55.360
<v 3>okay.
That guy's great.
This is from that movie.</v>

751
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:57.000
<v 10>I'm a fucking nice person.</v>

752
00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:00.240
I could cook like a motherfucker who makes some fucking straight up fucking

753
00:48:00.241 --> 00:48:03.780
grove.
Okay.
Chicken fried steak,
chicken,
Collard Greens.

754
00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:07.380
Fuck ain't mashed potatoes.
All that fucking good as sausage gravy,
biscuits.

755
00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:10.320
Fucking everything.
Me,
I cook like a motherfucker.

756
00:48:10.321 --> 00:48:13.200
I want to find a skinny ass little bitch.
I ain't make her fat.

757
00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:15.460
That'd be lose weight together.
I have a bond.

758
00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:22.450
<v 3>There you go.
Yeah,
that I missed that one.
That was really funny.</v>

759
00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:25.000
That was really fun.
And the juggle,
there's that documentary,

760
00:48:25.001 --> 00:48:30.001
but this was sent to us and it said that this is a Juggalo [inaudible]

761
00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:35.880
he's,
he gives you a while.
He introduces that,

762
00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:41.230
that he wrote a song and then he wants to free saw his song just for the public,

763
00:48:41.231 --> 00:48:44.170
you know.
Okay.
So this is a guy.
This is an original work.

764
00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:48.360
<v 11>Oh cool.
Um,</v>

765
00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:53.270
okay.
Here we go.
Here we go.
I have another beat down for you.

766
00:48:53.271 --> 00:48:57.190
I tried to practice talk just in my own song,
just mine production of song.

767
00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:00.210
Same one thing about the car building,
I'll sing it.

768
00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:05.820
<v 3>No,
that I think mistake number one is if you're going to sing a song,</v>

769
00:49:05.821 --> 00:49:10.810
you may want to go on a nice sound proofed environment or like a somewhat sounds

770
00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:14.780
like even guys indoors right
now with the,

771
00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:16.500
you can hear the traffic driving by,
right?
Right.

772
00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:21.120
Like not in front of the freeway.
Off Ramp and a parking lot somewhere.
Right.

773
00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:25.740
Good points.
Just sit in your car.
Even with the windows up.
Very true.

774
00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:31.020
Very true.
So there's sound problems.
Number one,
that is a fair assessment,

775
00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:35.490
but now you got to give at least give him a chance to do the song.
Of course.
Yes.

776
00:49:35.491 --> 00:49:37.170
Yes.
Okay,
here we go.
Here's the song.

777
00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:42.200
<v 11>Yes sir.
She's worth the machines.
Was Dan.
I got a gun and got again.
Yeah,</v>

778
00:49:42.201 --> 00:49:45.080
I've got a gun terminating her gun.
Yeah,
machines.

779
00:49:45.081 --> 00:49:50.081
But then machines worth [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] g six g 100% she's

780
00:49:53.351 --> 00:49:56.640
16 machines with thin or shootings with thin.

781
00:49:57.350 --> 00:50:00.740
<v 3>It's not,
I actually,
I don't think it's bad.
I cut him off.</v>

782
00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.600
<v 11>Charles Drake,
my rough,
trying to make my rough,</v>

783
00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:05.610

784
00:50:05.850 --> 00:50:09.360
trying to practice some are full machines with two machines.

785
00:50:09.361 --> 00:50:12.810
Was Jean with them?
My own the street.

786
00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:17.740
I don't care if the hitters fr the haters.
No.

787
00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:19.470
Hey machines worth it.

788
00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:23.220
<v 3>Was that a Bush I could leave cause that he pushed pressed aside.</v>

789
00:50:23.221 --> 00:50:27.740
I heard like cause it felt like right then he like brush up against something.

790
00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.620
Right.
What was that?
And there is a wrestling of some sort of,
yeah,

791
00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:34.610
<v 11>sure.
I'll talk to some are full machines with two machines.</v>

792
00:50:34.611 --> 00:50:39.050
Was gene where they stepped on something street?
I don't care.

793
00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:42.780
But the hitters fr the haters.
Monash loud,

794
00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:46.640
no change with it.
Now change then

795
00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:52.220
wrapping on the song shoes worth then walking down the streets,

796
00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.920
walking down the stretch,
walking down the street.

797
00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:01.440
<v 3>Here's a good thing so far he is,</v>

798
00:51:01.441 --> 00:51:05.970
he says align repeats that line.
Yeah.
That's called a song.

799
00:51:05.971 --> 00:51:09.810
Come and then finds an online repeats that line and then it goes back to that.

800
00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:13.680
Okay.
Yeah.
But that's what,
that's what a song is.
And is that what a song is?
Yeah.

801
00:51:13.681 --> 00:51:15.810
They just repeat the same crap over and over.
And I,

802
00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:20.000
I actually think you'd put that he,
you like him,
Tom Petty.
Same,

803
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:22.920
the same category.
All he needs is a better producer.

804
00:51:22.921 --> 00:51:26.070
We got to hook him up with like what's that guys name?

805
00:51:26.071 --> 00:51:29.790
Jimmy John with Dr Dre and that Jimmy I've been yes.
Right.

806
00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:32.280
Cause that guy would say if he

807
00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:37.350
would he be waiting because Jimmy Levine as m and m known it is the elevator.

808
00:51:37.351 --> 00:51:40.200
You think he'd be like the problem is because he was great at pairing people up

809
00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:44.220
with this guy who would go,
oh you need to bring with like that.
Right.

810
00:51:44.221 --> 00:51:45.680
Like you should you and dre you get together.

811
00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:49.650
Problem is this guy is too heavy for the elevator.
Yeah,
a little bit.

812
00:51:50.310 --> 00:51:54.840
They said after haters.
Here's the thing,
the machine machine within.
Yeah,

813
00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:59.360
the machine within.
It's kind of cat.
Here's it's,
I like it cause it's deep.
It's,

814
00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:04.110
it could be kind of a catchy in punk industrial jam,
I don't know.

815
00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:05.033
Needs help with the

816
00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:07.880
<v 11>loosening shoes with thin.
Yeah.
Shoes with this.</v>

817
00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:12.720
<v 3>Yeah.
Machines with then and they got a gun.</v>

818
00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:17.200
Got a gun terminating their gun.
The terminator again.
Yeah.
Coming at Ya.

819
00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:20.510
<v 11>Here we go.
I'll sing it.
I got it.</v>

820
00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:22.510
<v 3>Him and nick hoc.</v>

821
00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:27.340
Now that's an elevating Rapp Kinda guys,
right?
Yeah.

822
00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:30.020
Both have lyrical talent.
Yup.

823
00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:34.040
I see him like he should be with like rage against the machine or,
oh wow.

824
00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:36.240
Now you're thinking like Jimmy.
Yeah.

825
00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:39.510
Like I'd pair him with like that kind of a thing.
Yeah.

826
00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:43.280
But we know how hard it is to compose music.
You remember Animal Song?

827
00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:47.270
That's right.
And then what was yours called?
Um,

828
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:51.510
I did the butthole song.
Right.
It's hard.
And then you,
you did Kentucky.
Yeah,

829
00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:56.120
I can talk he song.
Yeah,
those are,
yeah,
those are,
those weren't easy to make.
No.

830
00:52:56.121 --> 00:53:00.560
Music is very difficult.
It takes a long time to make music.
Oh,
and I did the,
uh,

831
00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:04.940
the,
should we bravo,
so I remember.
Yeah,
that was a good song.
Yeah.
Those are like,

832
00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:07.530
those were really hard actually.
Yeah.

833
00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:13.230
<v 12>The animals.
My son,
my first hit.</v>

834
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:21.960
See,
I can see what's wrong with it already.
I'm hearing I want to come in sooner.

835
00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:32.940
<v 9>Here we go.</v>

836
00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:54.633
<v 11>What?</v>

837
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:07.660
<v 3>That's all I needed was this guy's lyric.
Well,
you need a producer.
Oh,
you're the,</v>

838
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:09.220
you're the producer.
I just did.

839
00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:12.730
I just made magic happens is elevated it by putting me together with this guy.

840
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:16.420
Damn,
dude,
that was awesome homie.
That's powerful.
That was pretty cool.

841
00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:20.560
That's what I did.
Um,
let's see what I have a really tight,

842
00:54:20.561 --> 00:54:22.930
this was my first song with you have a,
my,
if I got better with them,

843
00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:32.570
<v 9>hold,
hold,
hold,</v>

844
00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:35.173
hold.

845
00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:37.820
<v 3>Why do my ice cubes smell like a butthole?</v>

846
00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:44.200
<v 9>The smell,
the smell.</v>

847
00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:48.680
<v 3>It was like,
like really powerful.</v>

848
00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:52.273
<v 9>It's kind of good</v>

849
00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:57.573
<v 11>machining.</v>

850
00:54:57.710 --> 00:55:01.990
Something that actually fifth street bad.

851
00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:07.620
<v 9>Change what?</v>

852
00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:13.410
<v 3>But we don't eat anything that smells like buttholes.</v>

853
00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:19.050
Wow.
See,
this is how magic happens right here.

854
00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:23.610
She's just got to get the right people in the right room together at the right

855
00:55:23.611 --> 00:55:27.900
time.
And that's how classics get made.
That's what's happening right now.

856
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:31.790
This says Charro ad.
It's sold here.

857
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:38.490
Mommy,
I'm in charge here.
I want you to listen to me.

858
00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:43.350
Need to go to your mom's [inaudible] dot com and it's good,

859
00:55:43.351 --> 00:55:46.870
but some of the new shut,
you need a new poster.

860
00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:50.730
You know what I'm saying?

861
00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:58.930
I got kids to fit.
Keep it in hundred.
He's got,
can we go?

862
00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:02.280
Wow.
She wrote that copy and little aggressive.

863
00:56:04.610 --> 00:56:08.430
She would just,
that's the great thing about,
or you can just be like,
read this.

864
00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:13.890
Alright.
Oof.
Big words.

865
00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:15.090
Big words.

866
00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:21.280
<v 11>It's catchy
song.
Here we go.</v>

867
00:56:22.810 --> 00:56:27.330
Here we,
here we go.
Here we go.
Here we go again.
Here's my song.
Try and come back.

868
00:56:27.331 --> 00:56:28.960
Catch.
You're trying to singing my song.
Here we go.

869
00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:32.430
<v 3>I kind of want like it machines with machines.</v>

870
00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:36.060
I sang my song.
Yeah.

871
00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:40.200
I wish you could tell us the bt hears cause he has beaten.
It does.

872
00:56:40.201 --> 00:56:41.850
That's what I'm saying.
There's some vision here,

873
00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:45.570
but he needs a strong producer like you.
Yup.
Damn.

874
00:56:45.571 --> 00:56:48.500
You're like the Jimmy Dean of the Juggalo world.
Yeah.

875
00:56:48.570 --> 00:56:52.020
I feel like I could probably help this guy.
I wish we could have a talent show.

876
00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:56.100
Yep.
And get these people

877
00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:59.060
to another good thing around

878
00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:01.103
<v 13>hello</v>

879
00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:07.590
<v 11>the shoes with shoes with too.</v>

880
00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:13.100
<v 3>I don't know.
All right.
I've had enough of the machines with that one last part.</v>

881
00:57:13.210 --> 00:57:14.043
<v 11>Say it again.</v>

882
00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:20.100
She is shaved with dad working on my song shaved with machines,

883
00:57:21.071 --> 00:57:24.940
with death machines,
with den shoots,
with the hot,

884
00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:27.160
the Halloween happy Halloween.

885
00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:30.920
<v 3>It's my favorite holiday.
You know,
he,
um,
I,</v>

886
00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:34.490
I really wish you would have played that earlier cause I feel like that was the,

887
00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:37.040
that was a hook.
Like that was the hook I had to build up.

888
00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:42.630
I like that.
Yeah.
Strong finish.
Anyway,
she's,

889
00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:45.830
one of the things I'll be working on is my special shot.

890
00:57:45.831 --> 00:57:50.060
I have things to work on now.
So passion products and projects,

891
00:57:50.061 --> 00:57:54.500
you know what I mean?
Yeah.
So this guy could be your opener when you DJ.

892
00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:59.590
True.
Uh,
we have a couple of Dad boners I love dad.

893
00:57:59.591 --> 00:58:03.380
Boners do you want a justified or unjustified one?

894
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:06.440
I like unjustified.
Unjustified.
Hmm.
Well,

895
00:58:06.441 --> 00:58:08.680
I guess it's kind of a,

896
00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:11.510
I guess technically this is justified because of why,

897
00:58:11.511 --> 00:58:15.720
but it's still pretty entertaining machines where then machines with then

898
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:22.460
that justifies it.
Right.
Smoking Pot,
taking his drugs.
But

899
00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:24.450
<v 13>his reaction is pretty</v>

900
00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:33.610
Shanna's
forming some kind of thing and theirs

901
00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:35.900
<v 3>he's sees shadow,
isn't it?
Yes.</v>

902
00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:39.040
<v 13>Shadows look like they're coming together.
This form,</v>

903
00:58:39.350 --> 00:58:44.200
the fucking trees growing out of them.
Holy Fuck.

904
00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:48.920
No.
Through

905
00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:53.700
<v 14>few other tree shadows.
Fucking fig.</v>

906
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:59.270
<v 3>Yeah.
Drugs are good.
Yup.
You get that excited about shadows.
I mean,</v>

907
00:58:59.271 --> 00:59:03.470
you should be that excited about them,
I guess.
I mean,
he just smoked pot,
right?

908
00:59:03.471 --> 00:59:05.000
Like that's all.
That was Salvia.

909
00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:09.393
<v 14>Oh,</v>

910
00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:17.690
push
right there.

911
00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:23.750
Just hold it to hold it down.
It though.

912
00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:28.880
<v 7>I feel like if I had stayed in Hickory,
North Carolina,
we ended up like this guy.</v>

913
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:30.283
Without a doubt.

914
00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:33.080
<v 3>Wait,
what does Salvia again,</v>

915
00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:37.320
I remember red banned smoking in a million a million years ago.

916
00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:41.180
I thought you meant blue band.
No,
no,
no,
not blue pants.
I didn't know that.

917
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:45.710
That's not,
what was that stuff like?
It's like some weird hallucinogenic,

918
00:59:45.711 --> 00:59:50.630
isn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And do some visions and oh my God.
Yeah.
No,
thank you.

919
00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:55.670
Uh,
psychoactive plant.
No zags.
Yeah.
I'm for all that shit.

920
00:59:55.700 --> 01:00:00.290
I just need a glass of wine and I'm like,
I'm seeing shadows.
Yeah,

921
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:03.920
no,
it's,
you know,
glass of Pinot.
Grigios all mom needs.

922
01:00:08.010 --> 01:00:09.510
<v 14>Okay.
Mom and dad.</v>

923
01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:14.660
<v 9>Wow.</v>

924
01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:19.000
<v 3>Hello.
But again,
I mean,
I don't know,
it was borderline on Justin.</v>

925
01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:21.610
<v 7>It's justified because he's on drugs.
He's high.</v>

926
01:00:21.790 --> 01:00:26.440
But I mean you shouldn't be that excited about shadows.
No,
no,

927
01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:30.880
no.
He's talking though.
Drugs will do that to you.
Drugs get you excited.

928
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:36.520
Here's a,
here's what I think.
It's a little different.
Uh,
Guitar,
Dad boner.

929
01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:39.560
<v 15>Anyway,
one of the lots is this Gibson,</v>

930
01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:42.090
USC Guitar Kiss.

931
01:00:42.450 --> 01:00:45.320
No in the auction and it's hard to lock on it.

932
01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:50.080
And that's apparently the reason that it was a mystery lot was because it,

933
01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:52.570
it has a little parlor or the cardinal lit.

934
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:57.460
<v 7>Oh so this guy bid auction.
Yeah,
mystery but on a mystery item.
Right.</v>

935
01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:00.590
And now he's like a bad teacher because it's like if this,

936
01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:04.780
if this has what I think it has inside of it,
I'm a jack off right now.
Okay,

937
01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:06.210
<v 15>cool deposit pliers.</v>

938
01:01:06.211 --> 01:01:10.250
Cause it was quite flimsy lock and I've managed to em so twist it off my is to

939
01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:12.070
force it.
Eventually it took us awhile to put 10

940
01:01:12.370 --> 01:01:15.250
<v 7>so now you've got the lock off of the guitar case and he's like,</v>

941
01:01:15.251 --> 01:01:19.360
does this or does this not have this amazing to champs?
Yeah.
Side of it.

942
01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:24.620
<v 9>Just hope that it is what exactly.
Just all,</v>

943
01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:29.740
oh wow.
Wow,
wow.

944
01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:33.960
Wow.
That's awesome.
Yeah.

945
01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:39.470
That's a red one is all looks a railroad.
Oh,
whoa.
Oh Wow.

946
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:45.260
Wow.
That's the biggest bargain I have ever,

947
01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:47.300
ever hard.

948
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:51.100
<v 3>Oh,
I love seeing someone that extent.
Yeah.
This one's making me happy.
Yeah,</v>

949
01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.440
like the Douche does.

950
01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:56.580
The guy like doing Salvia at 40 in his backyard is kind of a bummer,

951
01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:57.510
but you shadows

952
01:01:59.970 --> 01:02:04.470
this guy is like genuinely stoked about something that matters.
I like that.

953
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.110
<v 14>Oh yeah.</v>

954
01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:09.030
<v 3>Okay.</v>

955
01:02:09.030 --> 01:02:13.590
<v 9>Oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,</v>

956
01:02:14.670 --> 01:02:17.470
oh,
oh,
oh

957
01:02:18.210 --> 01:02:18.480
<v 3>yeah.</v>

958
01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:23.480
Well the Trans Dorys the road tiles,

959
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:26.503
right?

960
01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:29.510
<v 16>Ooh,</v>

961
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.470
<v 3>sure.
I
did Fifo.</v>

962
01:02:33.471 --> 01:02:37.530
Woke us up at five in the morning with diarrhea and guy.
Cool.

963
01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:43.100
Unreal.
What did he eat?
He ate everything that the baby drops,

964
01:02:43.101 --> 01:02:46.940
you know?
Yeah.
Everything.
Spinach.
I just like,

965
01:02:46.941 --> 01:02:48.410
it's not even good for them.

966
01:02:48.411 --> 01:02:52.850
And the nine tasty and they love to eat everything that falls scrambled eggs,

967
01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:57.290
chicken,
everything,
man.
Everything.
Just apple sauce and you look it up.

968
01:02:57.730 --> 01:03:00.690
It's
bitsy.

969
01:03:00.770 --> 01:03:04.400
So fat from eating toddler droppings.
It's really bad.

970
01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:09.680
I know.
Fifo manner.
He hasn't had diarrhea in a minute.

971
01:03:09.681 --> 01:03:12.830
So should we try giving top dog recall?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What?

972
01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:16.190
What are we going to ask him about?
Anything and parking caught up in a while.

973
01:03:16.191 --> 01:03:20.840
You know,
I love talking to him.
Yeah.
I miss him.

974
01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:22.273
I know

975
01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:24.120
<v 17>he's supposed to come out.
Good</v>

976
01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:28.360
<v 3>answer.
He's my favorite bad at answering.
Oh Hey.</v>

977
01:03:28.790 --> 01:03:30.260
<v 17>Oh Dad,</v>

978
01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:32.930
<v 3>buddy.
Hey,
what are you doing?</v>

979
01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:37.720
<v 18>I'm driving back from seeing my brother.
Oh yeah.
How was it?</v>

980
01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:40.990
Oh,
it was great.
You know?
Yeah,
absolutely.

981
01:03:40.991 --> 01:03:44.420
The same conversation every time I go out there.
Yeah.

982
01:03:45.450 --> 01:03:49.140
Not In every case.
We say the same thing.
And then named Joe.

983
01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:50.660
<v 3>He's still a total animal.
Right.</v>

984
01:03:51.810 --> 01:03:53.310
<v 18>We go to that.
What's that?</v>

985
01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.900
<v 3>He's still a total animal.</v>

986
01:03:55.750 --> 01:04:00.370
<v 18>Oh yeah.
He's told me he's build a soup.
All right.</v>

987
01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:02.660
He's off for lunch today.
Yeah.

988
01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:07.300
<v 3>How have your,
um,
uh,
and then how is,
how does driving,
like,</v>

989
01:04:07.301 --> 01:04:10.060
cause that's a good drive.
How does that affect your going to the bathroom?

990
01:04:10.061 --> 01:04:13.690
Does that make you go more or less or how does it affect you?

991
01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:16.210
<v 18>Well,
you know,
I,</v>

992
01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:20.610
I made sure I left a whole job this morning to drive up.

993
01:04:20.611 --> 01:04:24.360
You see em that I'd drop the load.
Yeah.
Which I did.

994
01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:29.460
And then when I got up to visit him,
I dropped another luck.
Okay.
Yeah.

995
01:04:30.210 --> 01:04:33.750
And then when we went to lunch,
I had a mini load so high,

996
01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:37.350
I haven't had bombs away three times today.
And what I mean,
good.
Jake,

997
01:04:37.470 --> 01:04:39.030
<v 3>what kind of consistency though?</v>

998
01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:44.630
<v 18>Well,
the,
the,
the,
the third one really was just to kind of a mini last year.</v>

999
01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:48.230
Then the first one was,
was okay.
And the second one was okay,

1000
01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:51.890
but it's important to buy.
I hit the road.

1001
01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:57.380
You're like seven 30 in the morning,
then I'm totally screwed up the day.

1002
01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.570
<v 3>Oh really?
Yeah.
So,
uh,</v>

1003
01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:03.710
are you drinking Mcdonald's coffee on your way?
You know,
home,

1004
01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:05.480
is that what you do?
You stop there and get a coffee?

1005
01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:06.981
<v 18>Oh yeah.</v>

1006
01:05:06.981 --> 01:05:11.570
I go to the drive to get a coffee and three Greens just landed three claims to

1007
01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:14.940
split
and not yet.

1008
01:05:16.170 --> 01:05:19.060
<v 19>And that's your,
it's the best.
Right.
That's why he shitting so much,
mate.</v>

1009
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:21.610
I love it.
Yeah.
It's such good coffee,

1010
01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:24.170
but you shouldn't drink it off for you as you're driving.
Yeah,
I know.

1011
01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.330
That's probably gonna make you shit more.
Hey,
what did that,

1012
01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:31.380
you were at sea on a cruise when that horrific hurricane came through.

1013
01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:37.960
Um,
how was that,
what was that experience like being at sea during that?

1014
01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.930
<v 18>Well,
because we,
um,</v>

1015
01:05:41.830 --> 01:05:46.830
we were on the south side of Cuba and the storm was kind of coming through the

1016
01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:52.640
north side,
you know,
on the northeast side there.
I didn't like the ultimate,

1017
01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:55.670
you have a whole island in between,

1018
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:59.780
so we didn't get a single wave.
Okay.

1019
01:05:59.781 --> 01:06:01.490
It was just calm as you can get.

1020
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:07.520
My big concern was I parked my car on the ground floor.

1021
01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:08.940
<v 19>Yeah.
In Miami,</v>

1022
01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:12.070
<v 18>the Miami,
of course,</v>

1023
01:06:12.071 --> 01:06:15.910
I'm watching TV and I'm thinking,
and my car's going to get flooded.

1024
01:06:15.970 --> 01:06:19.920
I even called the insurance company from the shift just to,
you know,

1025
01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:23.530
may just to check the protocol and how do you,
well,
you're not going to believe.

1026
01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:27.610
And then I hear we can't get in Miami because there's a sunken sailboat.

1027
01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:30.390
<v 19>Wait,
what did they tell you was the protocol?</v>

1028
01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:35.290
<v 18>It's a water comes up all of the rocker panel.</v>

1029
01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:37.630
It's a total loss for them.

1030
01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:43.000
<v 19>Oh Wow.
How were,
how was the cruise food wise and,</v>

1031
01:06:43.001 --> 01:06:45.080
and,
and,
you know,
dumping wise for you?

1032
01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:50.670
<v 18>Oh,
the food was good.
And,
uh,
you know,</v>

1033
01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:55.490
I was in my dorm routine there and uh,

1034
01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.440
you know,
basically,
you know,
you can't eat a little bit more.

1035
01:06:59.470 --> 01:07:03.180
Cruise ships have basically two or three a day,
I probably,

1036
01:07:03.181 --> 01:07:07.530
and they extended the crews
25 drops on the growth

1037
01:07:08.110 --> 01:07:11.670
<v 19>kind of the whole week.
Wow.
Hey,</v>

1038
01:07:11.671 --> 01:07:14.880
you got four x four extra days.
Would you,
would you be willing,

1039
01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:19.910
I found a seminar where they can teach you to orgasm from hugging someone.

1040
01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:22.890
Would you go to it if I sent you to it with mom?

1041
01:07:25.550 --> 01:07:28.580
<v 18>You know,
I think that I probably,
uh,</v>

1042
01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:32.230
little,
little past that point.

1043
01:07:32.231 --> 01:07:36.370
I mean there was a time when I was in high school that I can orgasm without

1044
01:07:36.371 --> 01:07:37.510
hugging anybody.
Okay.

1045
01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:40.480
<v 19>Yeah.
But would you like to learn?</v>

1046
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:43.270
What'd you like to learn this tantric technique with mom?

1047
01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:47.450
<v 18>That would be fun.
That would be really exciting.
Okay.</v>

1048
01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:52.200
I'll have to explain to my butt and remains,
but you know,

1049
01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:57.410
you don't want her to think of some Indian religion,
you know what I mean?

1050
01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.600
<v 19>Right.
I will.
Um,</v>

1051
01:07:59.930 --> 01:08:03.800
I'll get all the details and send you guys and if you guys want to go,

1052
01:08:03.801 --> 01:08:05.670
it'll be all expenses paid.
Okay.

1053
01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:09.950
<v 18>Oh Wow.
Wow.</v>

1054
01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:14.830
<v 19>So if you want to go,
okay.</v>

1055
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:19.700
Okay.
So we'll do some research.
You know,
you let us know if you want to go,

1056
01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:24.980
hey,
it's supposed to make money.
Yeah.
It's supposed to really,
you know,
thing.

1057
01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:28.190
So was just,
I'm just thinking about it,
but look,
I have to run.
I love you.

1058
01:08:28.191 --> 01:08:31.450
I'll call you in a little while.
Okay.
I'll give it love you.

1059
01:08:32.890 --> 01:08:37.420
<v 3>Yeah.
I think he was more excited about the all expenses paid apart.</v>

1060
01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:40.570
He was like,
damn good.
And then like,
I'll pay for it.
He's like,
wow,

1061
01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:44.980
that'd be neat.
Now is it in Florida?
I have no,
I mean I have no idea where.

1062
01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:47.350
I wonder where I will look it up and if they teach a thing,

1063
01:08:47.351 --> 01:08:49.030
I always say I would send them.
Yeah.

1064
01:08:49.031 --> 01:08:52.930
We just have to have a crew follow them around.
So funny.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1065
01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:58.320
I would love to see my folks reporting on that because like my dad be like,

1066
01:08:58.871 --> 01:09:02.780
it's kind of goofy and my mom would just be like,
hey,
still disclose.

1067
01:09:02.790 --> 01:09:07.700
This is so crazy.
So KCP disgusting,
disgusting.
Crazy.
Yeah.

1068
01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:13.110
I mean she was a little reticent to even buy a new bra with me.

1069
01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:17.600
Right.
You know,
let alone learn to come hug you don't.

1070
01:09:17.601 --> 01:09:21.220
Another thing we played during our live show,
but I'm just so obsessed with it,

1071
01:09:22.090 --> 01:09:27.050
is that guy's weird speech pattern.
He,
yeah,
he does.
He does youtube videos.
Yeah.

1072
01:09:27.190 --> 01:09:29.770
I can't get him out of my head.
This is the guy.

1073
01:09:31.090 --> 01:09:35.650
<v 17>Texas has really been on my mind a lot lately and I wanted to go on your this</v>

1074
01:09:35.651 --> 01:09:37.870
state in my own way with a countdown.

1075
01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:43.080
Respectfully dedicate this list to everyone who has been affected by Hurricane

1076
01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:43.570
Harvey.

1077
01:09:43.570 --> 01:09:45.030
<v 3>All the inflections are wrong.</v>

1078
01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:50.220
Maybe it's a computer are v I feel like it's a computer program talking.
No,

1079
01:09:50.221 --> 01:09:51.980
like a highly advanced when it sounds like right.

1080
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:56.600
<v 17>Here's another video taken one night showing a door pop open for no reason that</v>

1081
01:09:56.601 --> 01:09:59.510
all this wasn't a regular door either.

1082
01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:03.110
It was a lock security and nobody was near.

1083
01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:07.370
I guess this could be a publicity stunt to drive visitors to the institute,

1084
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:11.960
but I doubt they would disrespect native American culture by faking all of this.

1085
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.823
Okay.

1086
01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:16.010
<v 3>Do you think he talks like this to,
to people and conversation?</v>

1087
01:10:16.011 --> 01:10:19.920
Did you think cause he's reading comp maybe.
Maybe the performing aspect.
Yeah.

1088
01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:23.760
<v 17>Megan and I have been together for nearly three years.</v>

1089
01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:24.693
<v 3>Okay.
Yeah.</v>

1090
01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:30.560
<v 17>Ah,
it's hard to tell if they were truly pulled out by a ghost where someone was</v>

1091
01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:34.940
just pushing other side of the shelf and playing a prank,

1092
01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:36.700
we'll never know for sure.
But it's,

1093
01:10:37.770 --> 01:10:41.070
<v 3>it's like ups speak down,
speak,
you know what I mean?
Let's all combined.</v>

1094
01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:45.920
I can't place where he's from either.
Know.
It's so bizarre.
Is it?
Is it just a,

1095
01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:49.560
Texas is hard.
Things were very bad.

1096
01:10:49.561 --> 01:10:54.420
They're never heard this,
this guy named his name is chills,

1097
01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:58.680
chills.
What's up?
Chills.

1098
01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:02.130
Let's see if he has,

1099
01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:08.250
if he has a bunch of stuff on there and not ever weird computer robot.

1100
01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:12.930
Yeah.
It's so weird.
I don't think that's it.

1101
01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:19.890
And so many people,
he does.
Remind me of the guy from,
uh,
married and dating,

1102
01:11:19.891 --> 01:11:24.790
the polyamory,
that fighter that you just played.
Yeah,
Megan.
Uh,

1103
01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:29.130
the vocal fry,
he has a similar,

1104
01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:32.720
<v 17>I'm still a bit shaken up from what happened.
There's him,</v>

1105
01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:36.660
I have no clue what I saw and they just want some answers explaining.

1106
01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:40.700
My family has managed to keep its hands on a good chuck of land out in the

1107
01:11:40.701 --> 01:11:45.470
middle of Ochoco national forest for us.
It's a beautiful place down there.

1108
01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:48.920
There's no cell service,
no paved roads.

1109
01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:52.040
And the closest person to us is miles away.

1110
01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:57.220
<v 3>So it's a person talking like 611,000 subscribers on his youtube channel.</v>

1111
01:11:58.310 --> 01:12:03.230
It must be the cadence you're wrapping people in.
Yeah,
cause I'm intrigued and I,

1112
01:12:03.290 --> 01:12:07.200
I'd like to see his face.
I wonder why he's not showing his identity.

1113
01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:08.593
<v 17>Sweet.</v>

1114
01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:13.490
<v 3>Hmm.
Is that add on that.
Sorry.
Um,
yeah.
I don't know.</v>

1115
01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:15.270
<v 7>I don't know.
Let's see.</v>

1116
01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.100
<v 17>To the face reveal,</v>

1117
01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.950
I wanted to talk to you about the new channel I'm launching called game be

1118
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.510

1125
01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:49.090

I dunno what I'm going to keep it intriguing.</v>

1126
01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:53.500

we should do that.

Chills,

1128
01:12:57.190 --> 01:13:01.540
The reason that I talk like this is that my family,
when we saw it goes,

1129
01:13:01.541 --> 01:13:06.320
says a kid who goes with talks to us in a higher language,

1130
01:13:06.321 --> 01:13:08.170
then you can process in your brain.

1131
01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:12.630
