So excited.</v>

4
00:00:23.181 --> 00:00:27.460
There's so many things to discuss.
A lot of fun going on in this episode.

5
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.470
Really?
Uh,

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.430
He

7
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.120
shout out to everybody.
Justin says,
hey guys,
Marty is jacked.

8
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.380
He keeps his jeans high and tight.
Sure he does.
That's true.
Yes.

9
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.360
I seen him with Jane's.
Yes.
Very high.
Very high rate.
Too tight and big arms.
Okay.

10
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.710
Actually he's a,
I dunno,
he's,

11
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.670
you think he's bigger than you are with respect to muscles?

12
00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.000
I don't know.
Oh,
is Randy?

13
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.330
Don't bring anyone loving to live.
No Bar.

14
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.900
<v 1>Well,
we'll go to your mom's house.</v>

15
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.910
<v 0>No.
Uh,
did you know that g one,
uh,
Eto?
Why?</v>

16
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.470
Yes,
I did.
I heard.
Yeah.
No,
someone said that he lips inked or something.
Yeah,

17
00:01:20.471 --> 00:01:24.550
he got ripped apart by country music fans.

18
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.210
He lip sync on the CMA,
the country music awards or whatever that is.

19
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.050
And he's such a good entertainer.
He doesn't,
he doesn't need to do that.

20
00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:36.400
So you wouldn't fucking do that.
Where their walker June.
That's right.

21
00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:37.750
Well he would have sung that shit

22
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.450
but all wheeler has been banned from those uh,
Oilers and banned from ever.

23
00:01:43.451 --> 00:01:43.811
He's about,

24
00:01:43.811 --> 00:01:48.250
I think we're going to see all wheeler on the Supreme Court and argue in his

25
00:01:48.251 --> 00:01:51.580
case that he's being censored.
Target Walmart.
They won't plug play.

26
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.940
They will play as shit.
Fucking too dangerous man.
Yeah,
that's true.

27
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.960
That's why I entertainer of the year.
That is just so crazy.

28
00:01:58.961 --> 00:02:02.410
How does one be alert?
Major G SWAPO sweat.

29
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.370
I up here,
he's still terrible.

30
00:02:06.371 --> 00:02:09.150
His Instagram stories and I watch every one of them.

31
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:13.330
I 11 I cherish them cause they're so shitty.
Dude.
I love by the way,
this shit,

32
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.260
when a nerd that's happened over the course of the show a bunch of times.
No,

33
00:02:17.261 --> 00:02:20.990
but like when our listeners get a shout out on like a new thing,

34
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.320
Justin says,
hey guys,
Marty is jacked.
He keeps his jeans high and tight.

35
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.110
That's true.
That's true.
Yes.
And then they have no idea what's going on.

36
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.750
It brought me back to look what's on page one of my drops page.
What's that?

37
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.613
Monkey Todd.

38
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.510
I remember the original he got on TMZ on there.
Uh,

39
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.450
the ones that they take call and I think of the Internet show.
Yeah.

40
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.620
And he got Harvey Levin.
That was the first time we ever loved Harvey 11.

41
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.730
The first time we ever had a mommy sabotaged.
Yeah.
This is page one.

42
00:02:52.731 --> 00:02:54.740
This was like right when the show started.

43
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.580
He was talking about where the dude,
I guess that's just the Harvey Harvey,

44
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.850
but he caught on,
I remember he was like,
all right.
He's like,

45
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.080
you know where the dudes are at heart.
Ah,
okay.
Yeah,

46
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.440
yeah,
yeah.

47
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.980
This is great cause this is like a local radio local news show,

48
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:21.690
like a local affiliate.
Rochester,
New York.
I think that's what they said.

49
00:03:21.691 --> 00:03:25.120
This is two square.
For those of you who aren't watching on youtube,

50
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:29.690
like two total.
You know,
Predator likes new SAS guys.

51
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.000
Like they're funny,
but they're,
you know,
they're sweet.
They're nice guys.
Yeah.

52
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.670
I mean they're kind of boners but they're like nice,
funny guys.

53
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.430
I got bamboozled by a mommy.
That's what happens,
man.
Play with mom.

54
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.440
You never know what's gonna Happen.
You know,
Shit gets real time made me laugh.

55
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:51.970
I like that stuff a lot.
I fucking love that stuff.
It's like,
it kind of is.

56
00:03:51.971 --> 00:03:56.590
Um,
you know,
to me it reminds me of the,
hey mommy,
thanks gene.
Stuff.

57
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.660
Drive through.
I almost forgot about how much fun that was.
You shouldn't,

58
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:04.720
if you listened to the show now,
um,
I can't,
you know,

59
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.250
give it that much context all at this moment.
But you look up,

60
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:13.690
I think there's are some on youtube if you look up,
hey mommy,
thanks jeans.

61
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.820
With relation to your mom's house is where we got people to go to drive throughs

62
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.370
and basically refer,

63
00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:26.371
like use jokes from the show in their drive through orders and his amazing,

64
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.760
well and it's something that in private life you and I still practice all the

65
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:31.091
time.

66
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:35.800
We decided to actually have fun for the first time in a long time and we took

67
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:40.360
off the rest of the afternoon and we went to eat Italian food and then we went

68
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:45.190
to a movie and everybody we call mommy or genes or genes.
Mommy,
you're just,

69
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:46.540
and nobody still to this day.

70
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:51.490
And even like the guy shaved Parmesan onto my plate and I go,
wow,

71
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:55.970
good job jeans.
You're welcome.
Like it doesn't register.
Nobody has.

72
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.830
And saying good job to somebody is like,
especially if you act impressed,

73
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.560
like good job jeans at Shaving Parmesan,
you know,

74
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.080
something to applaud someone.
I think he just thought like,

75
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.080
this guy's a fucking idiot.
It's two or drunk.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good job.
Good.

76
00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:17.290
Chad.
Really impressed when you poured that water chains.
Good job.

77
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.700
And then we saw the most boring movie on the fucking plan.

78
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.640
I kind of regret switching it.
We're going to go see Thor,

79
00:05:24.641 --> 00:05:27.010
which was like everyone's raving about,
but I was like,

80
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:29.170
I don't want to see that shit.
I just didn't care.
Well,

81
00:05:29.171 --> 00:05:34.030
you're not a comic book now.
I played sports growing up,
so yeah.

82
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.850
But yeah,
there's a different word for them too.
But um,

83
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.110
yeah.
So I went,
I saw a murder in a title and I was like,
let's go see that.

84
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.050
I knew that would make your bring joy to your heart.

85
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.680
So we saw murder on the Orient Express,

86
00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:55.480
which is based on the Agatha Christie book from 1902 and felt like they filmed

87
00:05:55.481 --> 00:05:56.960
it.
Yeah.

88
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.680
I mean it's a little doll because it's once it's one backdrop and Johnny Depp's

89
00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:06.530
in it and he's a customer
dragged.

90
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.510
And then there also was the,
I dunno,
um,
you know,

91
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.130
in,
in a thriller where there's new suspicion,

92
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.260
you do need to like lead people and then misdirect and then,

93
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.290
but when you do it like 10,
11 times,
it also starts snowing.
Yeah.

94
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.920
It just starts to be annoying when you don't clue the audience in on how the

95
00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:30.800
detective is coming to his conclusions.
Well,
he'll be like,

96
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.020
they won't even show anything.
He'd be like,

97
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.110
I noticed a scrape and the painting and you're like,
what painting?

98
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.030
We never saw that.
So he just did do some shit with like superhero style.

99
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.280
I noticed that you farther when you walked in the room.
All right.

100
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.090
And then that means you must have breakfast eight.
That's impressive.

101
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.410
Yeah.
Well,
one thing that really bothered us and this film,
uh,

102
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.690
Dame Judi Dench isn't it?
And she's,
she's fine.

103
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.670
I mean I could watch her do anything and she has two little lap dogs too.

104
00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:05.390
I thought she had one.
I thought it was till and the whole time.

105
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.700
I mean I was concerned because I'm like,

106
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.440
where are these dogs shitting and pissing on the train and they never show him

107
00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:14.090
going,
I never talk about it.

108
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:18.170
It's kind of like the Martian movie with Matt Damon where they're like,

109
00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:20.130
where do you jerk off and when are you,

110
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.530
how come you're not watching porn when you ask for stuff?

111
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.880
Was it bothered me about this film?
Much like the Matt Damon Film,

112
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.900
Why aren't you answering the important questions?
Like yes we know who done it,

113
00:07:29.901 --> 00:07:32.540
but where are these malteses taking their shits in there?

114
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.300
PICIS cause you're on this train for days.

115
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.480
It's what the next movie will probably be about as what I'm thinking when they

116
00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:42.320
do a sequel,
where,
where did the dog shit and Piss.

117
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:45.230
What a neat pitch.

118
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.460
And also like I watch people on airplanes taking international flights with

119
00:07:49.461 --> 00:07:50.840
their dogs and I think like,
well,

120
00:07:50.841 --> 00:07:54.170
how are those dog's pissing and shitting all their movie?

121
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:59.030
It could be a movie about that or a television series you're thinking,
yeah,

122
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.980
that's right.
I thought we could,
you know,

123
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.780
I know you have some TV meetings coming up.
You could too.

124
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.940
I thought you could pitch that and I thought for the dog's pissing and shitting,

125
00:08:10.941 --> 00:08:15.440
you could call it.
Where do I go?
Where do I go?
Where do I go?
You Go,

126
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.020
where do I go now?
Let me give you some advice.
When you,

127
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.870
when you walk in and you go,
where do I go?
And they'll be like,
well,
I'd be like,

128
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.240
that's all I talked to you about.

129
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:27.580
It's a show about dogs shitting and pissing in places that you don't know where

130
00:08:27.861 --> 00:08:31.570
they're going and then they'll be like,
oh,
that's intriguing.
Yes,

131
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.140
they go and then you go,
I need,

132
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:37.240
I need three acts and I need 22 minutes and I can blow people's minds in this

133
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:42.230
country.
I have a feeling I should open with you guys.
Are Dog lovers.
Right.

134
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.710
That's true.
I don't feel like that's the way to get them on board.

135
00:08:45.711 --> 00:08:46.820
And then I could be like,

136
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.770
but where do they go when people are on train the cars start with like your

137
00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:54.800
phone and go hold it up like that.

138
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.080
And you showed me like as a picture of my dog and they're like,

139
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.660
oh that's adorable.
And be like,
do you know where he shit and piss today?

140
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.920
And then they'll be like,
I'm sorry he went in the backyard cause he was home.

141
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.080
But what about when you see a dog on a plane?

142
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.970
You know like right away you grab them in like that.

143
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:14.070
And then if they don't like that one,
I was thinking I could follow it up.
Okay,

144
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:17.460
well that,
not that one,
but what about dog tick afternoon,

145
00:09:17.461 --> 00:09:20.100
which was one of the original great ideas on this show.

146
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:25.660
A pitch where you take different breeds of dogs on a walk and you explain to the

147
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:30.900
viewing audience their habits and behavior and you know the history of the dog

148
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:36.260
and then you masturbate the two dogs and then you see if they have different

149
00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:38.070
styles of orgasm.

150
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.890
I'm thinking ABC cause they do racier stuff.

151
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:49.700
This is more in line like a Fox show and then thinking of hosting you of course.

152
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:55.890
Wow.
Your show.
Okay.
What movie?
Cesar Milan,
you know,

153
00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.000
cute blonde and you go like hey guys,
you like dogs.

154
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.460
And then at the end of the dog episode the dogs come.

155
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.910
So right now you have a show pitching,
shitting and pissing and coming.

156
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.250
I can't think of a,

157
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:14.970
a more exciting talent moving forward for the networks.

158
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:19.590
Do you think our manager would like,
what is he going to like?
I would tell him,

159
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.040
I would say this,
I have a couple of great ideas.
I want to surprise you.

160
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.790
Don't tell him,
tell him the pitches and advance at all in advanced.

161
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.880
Just drop it on him in the room and I'm sure he'll be like,
yeah,

162
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.970
it'll really get on board with it.
I had known him a long time.
Yeah,

163
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.370
he'll like it.
He didn't like it and he'll like it a lot.
I really like this idea,

164
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:42.330
but I am serious.
That was distracting me the entire time as a dog lover.

165
00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:47.040
I was very upset at the idea of Dame Judi Dench keeping this dog hostage on this

166
00:10:47.041 --> 00:10:48.780
train.
Very,
yeah,
I'm serious though.

167
00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:52.410
How do you think that they let the dog piss and shit on the Orient Express?

168
00:10:52.411 --> 00:10:53.760
That's really good question.
I mean,

169
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.400
I don't know how they did it period in that era.

170
00:10:56.401 --> 00:10:58.920
I feel like now we live in an era where they're like,

171
00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:02.250
they'll build an area for dogs airport.

172
00:11:02.251 --> 00:11:04.050
There's like relief area for dogs,

173
00:11:04.051 --> 00:11:09.000
but that's just like the 1930s or something twenties I think.

174
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.460
Yeah,
like I guess I just let it Piss and shit where it wanted,

175
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:16.260
I sent got depressing too when they were unfolding the stone.
Fuck.
Real bummer.

176
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.460
Really fucked me in the ass,
man.
Really fuck me harder.
Fuck me and my asshole.

177
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.970
I didn't like that.
Uh,
what is this a question for you,

178
00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:31.080
Amy?
Emit Topia.
Oh,
I'm at a phobia.
What does that,

179
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.230
I'm an a metaphor,
but I don't like vomiting.
Oh,
okay.

180
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.480
I've talked about it before on a,
that's deep bro.

181
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:41.420
I talked about on this show actually.
Yeah.
Okay,
good.
I love advice on this one.

182
00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.250
Some advice regarding,
what is it phobia.

183
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.150
I'm a 33 year old woman.
I've been suffering for over 20 years.

184
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.520
How were you able to go through with pregnancy?

185
00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.730
My biological clock is ticking with the thought of morning sickness is

186
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.410
terrifying.
Thanks Amanda.
Amanda,

187
00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:01.330
I hear you because I had the same exact fear when I was pregnant with Ellis and

188
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.840
I will tell you that I never vomited with him.
So first of all,

189
00:12:04.841 --> 00:12:07.390
it's a metaphor via is a phobia of vomiting.

190
00:12:07.391 --> 00:12:10.470
And I've had it since I was like nine years old,
a long time.

191
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.370
I don't like hearing that,
you know,
I don't like it.

192
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:20.370
I'm going to rip off my head close
anyways.
Um,

193
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.410
it helped me to talk about it with my therapist.
If you have a therapist,

194
00:12:23.411 --> 00:12:24.730
I would recommend doing that.

195
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.540
And then I will tell you that when I was pregnant with Ellis,

196
00:12:28.541 --> 00:12:32.340
I would get nauseous,
but I would will it away.
But the other thing,

197
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:36.080
but then you told me later on,
somebody told you about a medicine.
Yeah.

198
00:12:36.081 --> 00:12:39.400
So here's what you can take.
Full disclosure,

199
00:12:39.401 --> 00:12:42.190
I'm not Rick recommending you take this and you talk to your physician.

200
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:46.990
Don't fucking,
I didn't make you take it.
You have to ask.
All right.
Yeah.

201
00:12:46.991 --> 00:12:51.970
So there's a medicine that can suppress the spasms in your stomach.
Uh,

202
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.900
so again,

203
00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:56.770
like that is something you can ask your doctor to prescribe you if you have a

204
00:12:56.771 --> 00:13:00.430
severe subscribe,
prescribed subscribe.

205
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:04.840
Did I say fucking subscribed?
But you're correcting my,
I'm thank you so much.

206
00:13:04.841 --> 00:13:09.250
You're right.
Yeah,
I got a subscription for it cause it's actually,

207
00:13:09.251 --> 00:13:12.040
I mean I've read about it.
Let's say you have food poisoning.

208
00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:15.190
It's not necessary for it to come out of your stomach.

209
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:19.270
I can go out the other way,
which is why a doctor would prescribe subsys sorry,

210
00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.650
subscribe it.
There you go.
Yeah.
So you can,
will it away.

211
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.930
And I have,
and maybe I'm just lucky

212
00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.350
all the time.
I've known you,
not one,
not one.

213
00:13:32.351 --> 00:13:36.670
How many years have known you a long,
but let's say we've been together.

214
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.710
I mean we started dating and oh five.
So yeah.
Yes.

215
00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:46.000
I have 12 years.
Knock on wood,
I have not vomited over when I got food poisoning.

216
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:51.160
I don't like talking about it,
but I remember in the sink and I didn't like it.

217
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.420
And I remember seeing the green parts of it and I fucking flipped out.

218
00:13:55.810 --> 00:14:00.000
Flipped out quietly.
Yeah.
Well I've learned to contain my anxiety.

219
00:14:00.001 --> 00:14:04.120
Like I get it and I'm so afraid of when Ellis is going to get food or stomach

220
00:14:04.121 --> 00:14:06.610
problems cause it's,
it's happy it's going to happen.

221
00:14:06.611 --> 00:14:09.940
It's gonna happen and I'm course I'll be alone with him.
You'll be on the road.

222
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:13.890
Well,
it's thinking of dog come and be vomiting.
Uh,

223
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:19.620
great.
Speaking of dog come and vomiting,
uh,

224
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:23.560
Jesus Christ,
what kind of Segue,
what are we going to go into now?

225
00:14:23.561 --> 00:14:27.380
I thought it makes total sense.
Louis C K has been,

226
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:33.280
um,
no,
he's one of the titans of art of our industry.
And,

227
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:38.140
and you know,
obviously if you were alive,
you've paid attention to it.

228
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:41.410
Probably if you follow comedy,
like comedy podcasts,

229
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:45.700
you probably well versed in already.
But there's this,
um,
you know,

230
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:48.910
there's this shakedown going down,
that's probably the wrong term,

231
00:14:48.911 --> 00:14:52.250
but there's this,
uh,
just shakedown good.
Just

232
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.240
<v 2>down.
It's going down in Hollywood.
No,
it's overall I think it's a,</v>

233
00:14:56.241 --> 00:15:00.600
it's actually a really good thing.
It's like checking some pretty horrible,
uh,

234
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:01.540
behavior and

235
00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:05.820
<v 0>behavior that's been known by the way in our community for a long time.
Yeah.</v>

236
00:15:05.821 --> 00:15:06.290
And I'm

237
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:10.240
<v 2>about,
I mean,
when I say checking behavior,
I'm talking about a,</v>

238
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:14.870
across the board.
I think it's good to check,
um,

239
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.940
powerful people that are abusing their power.
Yeah.

240
00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:23.720
And I think obviously the Weinstein one is massive and he's over.

241
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:28.040
He's been raping people.
He crazy.
And then,
you know,

242
00:15:28.041 --> 00:15:32.180
I made some jokes initially about the spacey one.
Yeah.
Because,

243
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.740
uh,
I,
I,
you know,
not that it's whatever,
it's not,

244
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.030
it's not like a good thing he was doing,
but I thought he was just kind of being,

245
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:46.430
uh,
you know,
overly flirtatious on the set.

246
00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:51.130
Like kind of like I said,
he was like rubbing guys shoulders that don't want,

247
00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:55.970
I was like,
oh,
he's just,
he's,
he's doing what some guys do to women,

248
00:15:55.971 --> 00:15:58.010
but to guys on the side of house of cards.

249
00:15:58.011 --> 00:16:02.540
And then stories came out about him with like 14 year old boys.

250
00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.730
Nice.
Attempting to rape one,
uh,

251
00:16:04.731 --> 00:16:08.000
supposedly raping another and turns out,
I mean,

252
00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:12.290
at least how it's being portrayed is that he's a fucking savage,
you know?

253
00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:13.723
Um,

254
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:19.030
and I think those guys will never work again and should never work again and

255
00:16:19.911 --> 00:16:23.300
some,
and I think,
you know,
I think Weinstein might go to prison.

256
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.360
<v 0>I hope so.
There's,
there active investigations.</v>

257
00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.880
He's a real Predator that was open cases on him in La and New York.

258
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.220
Yeah.
So they're like,
they're in their investment

259
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:38.990
<v 2>gating,
trying to find a way to charge that guy with a real crime.</v>

260
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:40.003
Yeah.

261
00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:44.540
<v 0>Well,
you know what,
let's,
I mean,
he did go to rehab for three whole days.
Tough.</v>

262
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:47.510
So let's not forget him and space here at the same place.

263
00:16:47.511 --> 00:16:50.630
Do you know that they're in the same Rehab facility?
Yeah.
Well good for them.

264
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.910
Yeah.
You can compare compare notes,

265
00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.140
but what's that Shit Shit head that uh,

266
00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:00.260
raped a 13 year old and he went to Paris.
Oh,

267
00:17:00.261 --> 00:17:04.230
Roman Polanski and has been continued to yeah,
they celebrate it.
Yeah.

268
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.610
She want to show business.
Loves that guy.
Welcome back.
Like what?

269
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.700
I wonder if they're going to further,

270
00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:12.840
<v 2>you know,
like he's been,</v>

271
00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.930
he's been defended by show business people for a long time.

272
00:17:15.931 --> 00:17:18.300
I know it's one of the more alarming things.

273
00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.180
If you don't know the Polanski story,
you can read it in detail,

274
00:17:21.181 --> 00:17:26.181
but he was convicted in Los Angeles county of sex with a 13 year old girl in a

275
00:17:28.561 --> 00:17:32.850
hot tub that he gave champagne too.
I don't know if he gave her a pill.
He,
um,

276
00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:36.780
you know,
had an agreement of certain amount of time to be served.

277
00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:41.520
The judge either retired or died.
And so like the replacement judge was like,
no,

278
00:17:41.521 --> 00:17:45.780
no,
you're gonna go to prison for a while.
And his,
his defense,

279
00:17:45.781 --> 00:17:48.780
I'm paraphrasing this stuff,
but like with something about,
yeah.

280
00:17:48.781 --> 00:17:53.590
But the last judge said we had a deal and basically new judge was like,

281
00:17:53.591 --> 00:17:55.230
I don't give a fuck about your deal.
Yeah.

282
00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:00.620
And so he got on a plane to Paris and that's that he's never come back.
Yeah.

283
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:04.380
He's tried to,
um,
ask for permission to come back.

284
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:08.760
And Los Angeles district attorney's for the last whatever,

285
00:18:08.761 --> 00:18:10.650
30 years I've been like,
nope,

286
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:15.630
you have an open warrant for your arrest if you're ever in.
Yeah.
You know,
around,

287
00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:19.920
um,
US territory's or any play anyways,
all that stuff.

288
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:24.660
Those guys are,
it's horrible.
Um,
with Louie,
you know,
the thing that,

289
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:29.280
uh,
first of all,
I was just like,
we've heard the stories for a long time,

290
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.900
you know,
uh,
particularly,
yeah.

291
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.710
<v 0>Let's put it this way.
It's,
it's been in our industry,
we've all known,</v>

292
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:41.470
the Comedians have spoken about for the last,
I thought it was a one,

293
00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.900
one of the things that I'm like,
hm is I'm hearing some of these comics go like,

294
00:18:44.901 --> 00:18:49.480
I didn't know that,
that,
I'm like,
well the thing is too,
you hear stories,

295
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.930
his peer like guys are his age.
Right,
right.
Yeah.

296
00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:58.130
Am I gonna let you kind of know that really?
I mean,
the thing is too,

297
00:18:58.131 --> 00:19:00.020
but,
but you know,
again,

298
00:19:00.021 --> 00:19:03.680
if you're in our shoes and you hear a story like that about somebody,
you don't,

299
00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.100
you weren't there.
You don't know all the facts.
You don't know.

300
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:12.110
You don't know what's true,
what's not,
what's,
you know what I mean?
Like stories.

301
00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:15.430
The telephone game is like,
okay.
I don't know.
I don't,

302
00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:20.430
<v 2>you don't know.
I know anything.
I Dunno.
I,
I,
here's the thing,
my,</v>

303
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:25.470
my thought on it is that what he did is not okay to do so clearly.

304
00:19:26.591 --> 00:19:28.680
It's really not okay to do that to people.
Um,

305
00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.630
especially if like those people are,
you know,

306
00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.330
like in a position working for something,

307
00:19:34.331 --> 00:19:38.920
like if they're working under you and like you're the boss basically in the

308
00:19:38.921 --> 00:19:40.230
room.
Right.
Um,

309
00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:42.950
<v 0>that's the whole thing is that he was in there,
there,
you know,</v>

310
00:19:42.951 --> 00:19:47.930
he's in the position of power and taking advantage of his powerful position.

311
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:52.220
It's fucked up.
It is,
it is fucked up.
Yeah.
But again,
like is it,

312
00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.060
is it worth ruining

313
00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:58.650
<v 2>someone's entire life?
You're like,
dude,
I have a lot.
I know.</v>

314
00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:01.800
I don't know how this,
I mean if it comes across really callous,

315
00:20:01.801 --> 00:20:06.801
but like when that story broke and when the consequences started,

316
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:12.810
you know,
coming to be,
I felt like a lot of empathy for that guy.

317
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.880
Not because I thought it was okay what he did,

318
00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:19.500
but like I just start thinking about somebody with,
you know,

319
00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.370
he's got two kids,
two daughters,
and like,

320
00:20:22.371 --> 00:20:24.900
and I know that the answer to that is like,
well,

321
00:20:24.901 --> 00:20:28.800
maybe you shouldn't have fucking done that then.
Yeah,
I get it.
Um,
and I'm not,

322
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:33.630
I'm not defending it or minimizing or diminishing what he did,
but it is,

323
00:20:33.631 --> 00:20:38.010
um,
you know,
I can't help but like,
I feel like that is fucking devastating.

324
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:42.570
A price to pay,
you know,
it is.
And I think too,
um,

325
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:46.950
<v 0>right,
like all crimes,
there's different levels of crime.
You have first degree,</v>

326
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:52.050
second degree murder,
manslaughter,
manslaughter,
aggravated robbery.
Yeah.

327
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.870
I think right now,
like to lump him in with a Harvey Weinstein.

328
00:20:55.871 --> 00:21:00.100
It's not okay to do that either.
It's not the same crime.
Now is it a crime?

329
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:01.030
Absolutely.
Is it,

330
00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:04.780
is it horrible and traumatic to have to go through something like that with a

331
00:21:04.781 --> 00:21:08.800
dude?
Yeah,
of course.
And honestly,
how many of look as a woman,

332
00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.370
have I seen dudes doing that in public?
Uh,
yeah,

333
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.130
every since I was 12 and,
and awake,
uh,

334
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.360
there's been dudes doing that.
I've ever said this publicly.
Yeah.

335
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:22.030
I have my own experience,
right.

336
00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.190
<v 2>With,
um,
uh,</v>

337
00:21:23.191 --> 00:21:28.191
a person who I worked for very early on in my show business career,

338
00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:30.413
um,

339
00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:35.420
living in Los Angeles and it was working for somebody in a position of power who

340
00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:41.340
did something in a very inappropriate,
and I've told you about it.

341
00:21:41.341 --> 00:21:42.440
I don't want to get into diesel and the,

342
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:47.130
I don't want to out the person either because I still know what the,

343
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:52.440
the end game that I'm looking for right there,
you know,
it's just like,

344
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:56.460
it's kind of one of those things where I just chalked it up to being like,

345
00:21:56.461 --> 00:22:01.410
that person is fucked up and they have their own demons and you know,

346
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.050
I don't know what's going to happen to them,
but yeah,

347
00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:09.030
<v 0>it's been a long time.
It's been a long time,
right?
Yeah.
I just,
uh,</v>

348
00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:13.120
Nah,
man,
it's so fucked up.
I think what really breaks your heart and oh,

349
00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:17.240
breaks our hearts.
I think you and I pacifically yeah.
Uh,

350
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:21.880
is that Louis is such a super talent too,
and you go like,
man,

351
00:22:21.881 --> 00:22:26.320
that's the guy we all,
we all look up to as the gold standard.

352
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:26.990
It's one of those

353
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:28.760
<v 2>things that people always,
you know,</v>

354
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:34.750
bring up with these super talents that have these flaws or these,

355
00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:40.060
you know,
like,
like you're Polanski's obviously a great director,
Ryan,

356
00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:43.340
you know,
Michael Jackson was one obviously like the whole

357
00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:46.260
<v 0>yes.
Celebrated his talent and then there was like,
oh,</v>

358
00:22:46.261 --> 00:22:49.800
is he fucking kids all the time or something.
Like it's kind of crazy.

359
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:51.900
Or Kelly r Kelly's.
Yeah,
for sure.

360
00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:57.040
<v 2>Um,
you know,
he's a,
that's real talk man.
He really needs,</v>

361
00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:58.240
<v 0>it's,</v>

362
00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:03.110
it's confusing and I think it is being caused was the worst because you're at

363
00:23:03.111 --> 00:23:07.220
the same as a fan.
Like let's take it back a,
as a fan of these people,
it's,

364
00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.040
it's such a psychological mind.
Fuck.
You're like,
wait,

365
00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:13.310
am I allowed to like this person anymore?
I think the other part of it,

366
00:23:13.311 --> 00:23:14.530
I think this affects people,

367
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.610
<v 2>Gus,
with regards to Louis is that we're,</v>

368
00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.910
we work in his field and like,
you know,

369
00:23:21.911 --> 00:23:26.911
Cosby's seems so separated from us because he's like 50 years older.

370
00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:29.200
Right.
And like the way he came up.

371
00:23:29.201 --> 00:23:34.201
But like we have like a certain bond with Louie because Louie is kind of like

372
00:23:36.971 --> 00:23:39.390
the talent wise and like

373
00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:44.170
<v 0>kind of the Cosby of our era,
right?
Like he's the guy in the class ahead of us.</v>

374
00:23:44.171 --> 00:23:46.370
He's the class ahead us.
But we've seen him,

375
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.060
<v 2>like we remember him having his first special yeah.</v>

376
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:54.950
And seeing the trajectory,
seeing the build.
And so in a way he's like,

377
00:23:54.951 --> 00:23:58.940
he's like the big brother even of Comedians who aren't friends with him.

378
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:02.810
Like you go like wow,
like look at him doing this and this and this.
You know.

379
00:24:02.811 --> 00:24:04.710
So it's like you kind of want to,

380
00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:09.350
we've all kind of been like in awe even if he's not your like I know some people

381
00:24:09.351 --> 00:24:14.270
are like,
you know,
content wise,
they're not like into him or whatever.

382
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:19.240
Look man,
objectively,
skill wise,
he's such a skilled comedian.
Yeah,

383
00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:24.050
it's wild.
Yeah.
It's a fucking bummer dude.
It's just,
it is the whole thing.

384
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:26.000
I mean it's sad.
I feel like that it happened.

385
00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:30.130
Like it sad that he did that and sad for the women that experienced it.

386
00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:34.760
But I'm also sad at the,
um,
like someone's,
you know,

387
00:24:34.761 --> 00:24:37.840
life being just totally

388
00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:42.920
<v 0>ruined,
totally devastated right now.
Yeah.
Fuck.
And they try it,
you know,
and,</v>

389
00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:47.420
and lumping in the people close to him,
making it about,
like his manager is like,

390
00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:51.130
I dunno what the fuck that's all about that and stuff too.
You're like,
well look,

391
00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:56.280
the manager is only going by what he's been told by the client and it's the

392
00:24:57.431 --> 00:25:01.780
manager's job to protect the client.
So you can't,

393
00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:04.240
you can't be like,
hey,
the manager should have known,

394
00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.710
there's a lot of things they're not omnipotent.
Yeah.

395
00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:10.930
Like going to mislead the person that you're wanting to help you cover for it.

396
00:25:10.931 --> 00:25:13.990
So he's not going to be like,
can I tell him everything that I did?

397
00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.890
Here's what I went.
No,
he's going to be like,
I didn't really,
you know,
you,

398
00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.450
of course he's going to minimize of most likely.

399
00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:24.010
And if you have a good manager,
they're gonna fucking try to help you.

400
00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.160
They're going to help you out of the mud.
So,
and he wasn't,
by the way,

401
00:25:27.161 --> 00:25:32.110
he wasn't helping a superstar.
That's right.
At the time.
Right,

402
00:25:32.111 --> 00:25:34.170
right,
right.
Or like,
yeah,
of course you're going

403
00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:38.640
<v 2>broken protect.
This was fucking a long time ago.
Yeah.
So I mean,</v>

404
00:25:38.641 --> 00:25:39.474
I'm not like,

405
00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:44.340
I know people are already going to jump on us for the way that we're phrasing

406
00:25:44.341 --> 00:25:46.290
this,
I guess.
But,
um,

407
00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:52.020
I just feel like part of what's going on right now is there's like a hysteria,

408
00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:56.160
um,
which again,
the end result is that it's going to,

409
00:25:56.250 --> 00:26:00.290
it's going to check people in power to really think twice before

410
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.710
<v 0>yes.
All their moving.
And this is,
that's a good thing.</v>

411
00:26:02.711 --> 00:26:07.000
And this is a necessary move in the evolution of equality for women.

412
00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:11.080
This is a necessary,
yeah.
I mean,
you're abroad.
Okay.

413
00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:12.640
Uh,

414
00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:16.660
but it is a necessary thing to do to start weeding out these jerk offs that are

415
00:26:16.661 --> 00:26:20.770
abusing women,
abusing and molesting children.
By the way,

416
00:26:20.771 --> 00:26:24.790
Corey Feldman's coming out and naming people and who in the 80s were molesting,

417
00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:25.840
and he said,

418
00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:30.550
this is a known thing that there are pedophiles and two that came out against a

419
00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:33.000
spacey.
He was 14.
Yeah.

420
00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:37.660
I mean there's a 14 year old boy and that's fucking unbelievable.
But it's,

421
00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:38.031
it is a,

422
00:26:38.031 --> 00:26:42.160
it is a necessary thing to get things more equal and to clean up the business a

423
00:26:42.161 --> 00:26:46.050
little bit,
you know?
Yeah.
It's,
it's terrible.
The whole thing is devastating.

424
00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:48.700
It's terrible,
man.
I don't know.

425
00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:54.900
Oh God,
that's a lot.
I'll make you slap the mat in the bay.

426
00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:59.870
That's the truth,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
That's enough.
Uh,
show show business.

427
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:04.050
You know,
we usually don't talk her to events,
uh,
but you know,

428
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:09.420
this is happening in our,
in our community.
So yeah.
Um,
maybe a half deal.

429
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:11.910
I could maybe a mix it up and,

430
00:27:11.911 --> 00:27:15.420
or change the speed a little bit by I'm telling you that we finally got some

431
00:27:15.421 --> 00:27:20.250
more,
she's retarded ministries from our listeners.
Oh,
thank,
thank God.

432
00:27:20.251 --> 00:27:20.551
I mean,

433
00:27:20.551 --> 00:27:24.930
she's retarded and machines will then have become the two smash hit songs of the

434
00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:27.240
fall season.
It's really,
really taken over.
And you know,

435
00:27:27.241 --> 00:27:30.750
there was some excuse retarded is that came in last week we played and some were

436
00:27:30.751 --> 00:27:34.860
okay.
Some were better,
but there's some definitely better ones in this week.

437
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:37.790
I'll give you a couple of here.
He's a of

438
00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.050
<v 3>club mix</v>

439
00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:43.493
them solely.

440
00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:50.790
Awesome.
What all of the clubs.
I like that.

441
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:10.000
Well,
I love it.
You can play that.

442
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.630
We could play that anyway.

443
00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:17.710
<v 0>Absolutely fantastic.
Um,
you actually could play that at any Oh,
you could.
Yeah.</v>

444
00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:21.820
It will be great if we could have that played at a club and then people halfway

445
00:28:21.821 --> 00:28:25.870
through and be like,
wait a minute.
What?
What are they singing this song?

446
00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:32.290
This is Tim from Australia.
You Ready?
Ready?

447
00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:33.640
<v 4>Okay,
go.</v>

448
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.793
She's retired.

449
00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:42.640
She's retarded.

450
00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:47.530
She's retarded.

451
00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:54.310
Retarded.
Sounds

452
00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:04.060
great.
Very good work.

453
00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:16.170
<v 0>And then the one I,
that's a great,
that's Tim from Australia.
Thanks Tim.</v>

454
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.730
Thanks Tim.
The one I've been waiting for,
I told you I met him,
uh,

455
00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:24.690
finally a few weeks ago when I was in,
uh,
Austin Gaping Dad.

456
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:29.320
Wow.
He's sending some of the great hits of your mom's house music history.
Yes.

457
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:34.140
Celebrity in our,

G and a.
He made a,

458
00:29:34.141 --> 00:29:36.330
she's retarded.
So you know,

459
00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.690
I feel like some of our producers,

460
00:29:39.691 --> 00:29:42.640
our music producers on this are have earned it.
Yeah.

461
00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.273
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

462
00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.990
<v 0>He's gaping dad.
He deserves it.</v>

463
00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:57.480
I haven't even heard it and I just feel like he deserves it already.

464
00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:01.590
He always does a good job.
That's quality work always.
So,
uh,
here we go.
Ready?

465
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:06.870
Finally.

Make a branch and get over it.

467
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.190
<v 1>Yeah,

468
00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:18.443
yeah,

469
00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:24.843
yeah,

470
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:31.663
yeah,

471
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.943
yeah.

472
00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:03.020
<v 5>Fire little fucking song.</v>

473
00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:09.550
You
got to get off.

474
00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:27.683
<v 4>I mean,</v>

475
00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:35.620
this is an epic

476
00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:39.610
<v 0>masterpiece.
Really has an incorporates so many of our favorites.
It really is.</v>

477
00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:42.880
I'll tell you what I'll do is this song,
is I just a full length song?

478
00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:47.930
I will close this episode with that full Song Mega Bridge and get over it.

479
00:31:47.931 --> 00:31:51.850
Briefly go over it.
But it's so great.
I like those too.
I know.

480
00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.070
Do you know who scrim is by any chance?

481
00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:59.890
You always say what one are you going to lick my scrim?
No,
I say scrum.
Hmm.
No,

482
00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.960
this is a rapper.
His name is scrim.
Oh,

483
00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:08.440
he also goes by suicide Christ.
Okay,
and he's in the suicide boys.
Oh boy.

484
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.570
That's not a bad name.
There's the dead boys.

485
00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:13.290
Suicide was not a bad name for a band.
Well,

486
00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:16.990
I want you to pay attention to what Scrim is saying here because I feel like you

487
00:32:16.991 --> 00:32:19.090
could learn a thing or two.
Okay.
Yeah.

488
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:21.580
<v 6>Hi.
The whole thing.
Well,
they can.
Hey asshole.</v>

489
00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:25.310
Is this like I'm down to do it alone.
Motherfuckers think I'm sick.

490
00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:30.770
I'm down to do it.
I did it before and it's pretty fucking nice.
Like I enjoy it.

491
00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:32.980
<v 0>Yeah.
Right.
Okay.</v>

492
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:37.670
<v 6>I like having like a,
like a black case with a fat ass spread spreading cheese,</v>

493
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:42.170
like put it on my face.
You know what I'm saying?
Why?
Here's the stipulations.

494
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.820
If I'm going to do some shit like that.

495
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.260
<v 0>Okay.
Pink Guy,
he got,</v>

496
00:32:48.261 --> 00:32:51.950
he's got some stipulations though.
Stipulation stipulations,

497
00:32:51.951 --> 00:32:53.290
man can you know?

498
00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.560
<v 6>Sure.
Some shit like that.</v>

499
00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:58.340
<v 0>Thank God.
What are the stipulations when man</v>

500
00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:03.120
<v 6>fire herself?
No fog,
no far lane.
Even a pitch in front of me ever.</v>

501
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.570
You might get sitting down with.

502
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:08.660
Cause if she farts in front of me.
Yeah.

503
00:33:08.661 --> 00:33:12.480
At parties over like I'm breaking up with you right then man.
Wow.

504
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:15.350
<v 0>No,
I could not have a relationship with scrim.</v>

505
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:20.030
You could and you're also not black.
He said,
oh bitch with a black bit.
Sorry.

506
00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:23.260
Right.
I meant I did hear that.
I'm sorry I didn't.
Yeah,

507
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:27.590
I was hoping he'd be an equal opportunity but liquor.
But he likes white bitches.

508
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:30.920
You better never fart.
So yeah,
you're out of the I'm Ariana running.
Yeah.

509
00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:34.120
<v 6>For screening.
For the stipulations of assays.
Yeah.</v>

510
00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:37.100
One of two things have to happen all at both things happening.

511
00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:42.290
It just makes it better for me.
What's that?
Got To bleach to hate us.
Oh,
Scott.

512
00:33:42.291 --> 00:33:44.780
A blockchain.
It's gotta be fresh.
Gotta be clean.

513
00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:48.090
And I wonder what else can get it more clean and then bleach in them all the

514
00:33:48.091 --> 00:33:52.790
fuck.
I mean,
correct me if I'm wrong,
matricide with the fucking car.

515
00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:55.360
It's a carcinogen cleaner food.

516
00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:59.320
I wouldn't want her to ride her fucking ass off some ass shit like y'all talking

517
00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:01.060
about it.
It's wrong.
And beliefs off of them.

518
00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:05.770
<v 0>Okay.
But why wait a minute.
No,
he,
he likes uh,
black women,</v>

519
00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:09.820
but he's asking them to bleach their anuses.
It does actually skin bleaching.

520
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:13.210
Right.
You bleach your skin around your anus,

521
00:34:13.211 --> 00:34:16.150
which is I imagine very painful,
I'm sure.

522
00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:19.880
And if he likes the darker ladies,
why are you asking him to bleach it?

523
00:34:19.881 --> 00:34:24.370
Light or it seems counter intuitive as what I'm saying you for a darker.
Right.

524
00:34:24.371 --> 00:34:27.750
Why don't you paint your asshole black?
Right.
You know,
that's what I would say.

525
00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:32.130
Can you pay for asshole?
But he does have those knuckle tattoos that I liked.

526
00:34:32.131 --> 00:34:36.310
So I a lot of tattoos.
I do like those and he talks the way.
Yeah.

527
00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:41.680
<v 6>Or secondly,
if she gets like fresh,
like straight out the shower.</v>

528
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:44.950
Well that's why I'm much easier dry on like,
you know what I'm saying?
Like,

529
00:34:44.951 --> 00:34:48.800
so it's still sitting in ISS open.
So stuff like that.
Yeah.

530
00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.770
Then I'm throwing her down and we're getting it in.
Yeah.

531
00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:55.900
<v 0>So he requires ass bleaching or suds in the hall.</v>

532
00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:59.220
I think it's much easier to wash your asshole then to get it bleach.

533
00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:02.070
But he's saying suds still in there,
like soap is like,

534
00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.160
he's just saying like your extra clean,
you know,
like,
yeah.

535
00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:08.110
Then he doesn't really like eating ass.
I feel like he likes,
they went,
Oh,

536
00:35:08.111 --> 00:35:11.740
you're saying that he should have like a little dirty little Tang.
Wow.
Well,

537
00:35:11.741 --> 00:35:16.000
if you're into eating buttholes don't you want it to be kind of in a state of a

538
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:19.850
butthole?
He's then he's when he mans will lick a,
uh,
uh,

539
00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.210
a forearm or a forehead.
Do you know what I'm saying?

540
00:35:22.211 --> 00:35:26.290
What you're saying then the taboo is gone if there's no Tang on it.
Yeah.

541
00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:31.090
Little stink.
Right.
A little bit.
Right.
But not a lot.
Right.
A lot.

542
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:36.040
It's too tangy.
Like a whole day of me.
Oh God.
Running around.

543
00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:39.840
Would you like my butthole after [inaudible]?
No,
no,
no,

544
00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:44.770
<v 6>but it's not stipulated that she has to have the clean shaven us.
Absolutely.</v>

545
00:35:44.771 --> 00:35:48.970
Hold on.
That's like automatic.
I never,
to me,

546
00:35:48.971 --> 00:35:51.970
I thought that was just natural.
That's like automatic.
It's like,
bitch,

547
00:35:51.971 --> 00:35:55.510
if you bend over and I see one little fucking hair isn't,
they get,

548
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:58.110
you know what I'm saying?
It's like,
Ooh,
Yay.

549
00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.720
<v 0>So he doesn't really like looking ass is what I'm trying to say.
He,</v>

550
00:36:01.721 --> 00:36:05.200
he's got all these rules and stipulations.
He's got high standards.

551
00:36:05.201 --> 00:36:08.290
This Guy Scrim.
Yeah.
I don't think he really likes it.

552
00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:11.140
I don't know if he doesn't really like it,
but he's got some,
you know,
he's like,

553
00:36:11.141 --> 00:36:13.990
you better never fart in front of me,
but I've never see a fucking hair.

554
00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:17.740
I can't deal with it.
It'd be bleached.
And that'd be soap.
Yeah,
he just got his,

555
00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:22.000
he's got a very,
very clear preferences.
His standards are just too high for much.

556
00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:26.740
I mean I can't get my B whole hair less.
I don't wax.
Wait,

557
00:36:26.741 --> 00:36:29.650
why can't you get a hairless?
I don't wax down there.

558
00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:34.000
I don't believe in pouring hot wax on my most sensitive parts of my body.

559
00:36:34.001 --> 00:36:36.940
And then you can get it.
I won't,
I refuse.

560
00:36:36.941 --> 00:36:41.710
I think it's cruel and unusual punishment.
I think it's,
it's,
I just won't do it.

561
00:36:41.711 --> 00:36:46.300
Why?
For?
For what?
When I can use a razor.
So you'd be,
you still use a razor?
Yeah.

562
00:36:46.301 --> 00:36:48.580
On the under carriage and I can get my pee hole,

563
00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:52.690
I can kind of graze my ass hole to get,
I'm not very,
I mean,
you know me,
I'm not,

564
00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:56.680
you don't have a lot of hair.
I'm not very hairy.
No,
I don't think compare it to,

565
00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.840
yeah.
So it's not a big issue for me.

566
00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:02.320
I built a bitch is a guy hair coming out everywhere I go.

567
00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:05.140
I was with a girl was I thought she had a pair of balls in her pants.

568
00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:08.320
Like I was like,
what is it,
what you're talking about?

569
00:37:08.321 --> 00:37:13.321
So Harry Harry got the underwear and a bulge and I was like,

570
00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:17.800
oh,
Cindy,
I swear to you.
She was so hearing that she had a bald and I was like,

571
00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:22.400
Nah.
And then when the,
when the panties dropped,
it was just like dog.

572
00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:27.070
I mean it was that,
what year was this?
70 64 I know.

573
00:37:27.071 --> 00:37:31.160
It felt like it was,
I mean it was,
but she was just super hairy,
you know,
now.

574
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:35.720
But that what I'm serious.
What year is this?
What year is it?
Like,

575
00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:40.090
Oh yeah,
maybe 2000 yeah.
Yeah.
So you'd think like you've gotten the memo,

576
00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:44.600
that general societal consensus is shave or wax,
you know,

577
00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:46.020
Trim it down.
I made sure she was,

578
00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:50.050
I mean she was shaved where she needed to be shaved,
but oh,

579
00:37:50.051 --> 00:37:54.820
you're saying like so strong.
Right,
right.
There's so much bulk.

580
00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:57.590
Right.
And I mean she was just a Harry Harry broad.

581
00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:02.230
Now you do the courtesy of a trimming up down there for I try to,
yeah,

582
00:38:02.231 --> 00:38:04.990
try to trim it pretty,
I mean sometimes I'll forget and I'll look,
I'll be like,

583
00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:09.790
oof,
now God,
I can see where my dog much hair.
That doesn't bother me per,

584
00:38:09.791 --> 00:38:14.530
I don't care.
But do you know that the trend now for girls is totally bald?
Wait,

585
00:38:14.531 --> 00:38:18.130
that's been for years.
I feel that.
I just heard about it on the Internet.
No,

586
00:38:18.131 --> 00:38:18.964
I swear to God I,

587
00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:23.180
I was reading something and apparently bald is where the party's at.
Nyu.

588
00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:25.690
It hasn't bald been the thing that lasted 15 years.
Yeah.

589
00:38:25.691 --> 00:38:28.450
But when I was a single girl,
when you and I started dating,

590
00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:31.330
the landing strip was trend the norm.

591
00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:34.030
So now I'm saying that the the Hitler is,

592
00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:37.270
is gone now it's just totally baby baby.

593
00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:41.230
Baby beaver has been around for a while and I I to tell you,

594
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:45.010
I had a few baby beavs not that like it doesn't,

595
00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:49.450
it being hairless doesn't really do anything for me.
I prefer the landing strip.

596
00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:53.470
I feel it as an adult,
as a mature.
Well maybe that's what it is.

597
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:58.270
I have pubic hair so I'm a grown man.
I had puberty.
It's weird.

598
00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:03.000
It is kind of show this,
you shaved it like a little kid.
Yeah.
Nice.
Yeah.

599
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:05.200
It's weird.
Yeah.
I mean look,

600
00:39:05.201 --> 00:39:07.600
I'm not one of those people that grows out in my armpit hair.

601
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:11.860
I do let the leg hair go cause it's blonde.
I think hairless Cox are weird,

602
00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:13.870
you know?
Oh that's so weird.

603
00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:18.920
Or when a dude shave like shaves a perfect patch over it.
Like when it's,

604
00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:22.140
when it's really well you see that?
Yeah.

605
00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:27.170
It's like he shaves like how I would shave a like a beard line church right over

606
00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.120
Rican.
I'm Puerto Rican beard.
Yeah.

607
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:33.280
Isn't that weird over a Dong like it feels like it should be.

608
00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:34.660
You can trim it down,

609
00:39:34.661 --> 00:39:38.890
but I think that's for pornos the shaping of they look bigger on cameras and no,

610
00:39:38.891 --> 00:39:43.210
but yeah,
but I'm saying like some of them are so meticulously shaving.
I'm like,

611
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:48.280
okay,
well I'm sexual.
Yeah,
it's a little much.
Yeah.
Yeah.

612
00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:50.740
Maybe that's what it is.
Just feels feminine to be like,

613
00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:54.240
I put the line here and then I used the ruler and then I moved here.

614
00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:55.570
It was the same here.
It's like,

615
00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:58.660
what'd you just trim that down and make it look like you're ready?
My sweetheart,

616
00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:00.250
why don't you put a bow on it?

617
00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:05.490
You know what I don't like is a personally like buff guys that shaved their

618
00:40:05.861 --> 00:40:09.910
chest and then you see the growth coming alone or selling.
I just,
I'm like,

619
00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:13.890
just have hair just out there.
I know some people are really anti here.

620
00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:16.630
Look at me.
Look at my head.
You are,
I know.

621
00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:21.640
I'm like a fucking space monkey shot on his face.
Second fight.
Crap.

622
00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:25.280
I have to Fart.
When are we gonna get these mics?
Yeah,
it's been a while.

623
00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:28.450
Um,
I did,
I went for it.
You know what it is?

624
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:31.230
I've been getting my hair cut by the same guy you've been getting your haircut

625
00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:35.560
by.
I love that guy.
Everybody in her family goes to now.
Oh,
it was great.

626
00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:40.720
And um,
we've done different things,
but then over the years,

627
00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:42.640
this front area has thinned out.

628
00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:47.270
And so I believe in like when you're thinning in an area and keep it short.
Yeah.

629
00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:51.010
So we've been keeping it short,
but then the more that it thins out,

630
00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:53.890
it's like I get a haircut and then a week later I'm like,
oh no.

631
00:40:53.891 --> 00:40:55.920
It's just like glaringly thin.
Oh,

632
00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:58.990
that's why you're doing it because you feel like the grow out is making that

633
00:40:58.991 --> 00:41:03.250
show more?
It does.
I don't feel like it does.
It does.
So it's like a,

634
00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:07.780
to me it's like just throwing the towel and go,
oh,
I'll just go shorter.

635
00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:12.280
So the haircut lasts longer.
Oh,
I see.
I didn't know your reasoning.
I didn't know.

636
00:41:12.281 --> 00:41:15.730
I didn't understand this logic.
I really,
really,
what do you think was happening?

637
00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:20.800
You just want it to be like a cool guy.
Oh No,

638
00:41:20.801 --> 00:41:25.060
I got an older dad and just go ahead and get your dad,
your dad cut.

639
00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:25.961
You know,

640
00:41:25.961 --> 00:41:30.520
I just feel like I'm getting haircuts that lasts 10 days.

641
00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:34.940
I did not know.
That's why I think it looks great.
I think you're very handsome.

642
00:41:34.941 --> 00:41:38.510
We're very like,
what's going on?
Why don't I don't like change?

643
00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:43.370
And I walked in and I was a,
we think you're like different.
And I was like,

644
00:41:43.371 --> 00:41:45.650
Oh shit.
I don't like change.

645
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:49.430
I've been with the same hairdresser since I was 20 years old.

646
00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:54.440
That's 21 years I've been going to Allen.
No one else has colored my hair since.

647
00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.470
That's only Allen.
Uh,
I don't like change.

648
00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:02.240
And I like you to look the way I'm used to looking,
you know,

649
00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:05.390
it doesn't look that it took me a while to get used to it.

650
00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:09.960
At first I was shocked because I'm like,
that's a real dad.

651
00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.170
Jason Statham my new husband.

652
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:17.720
But now I like it cause I feel like it's more rugged.
I feel like you're like,
oh,

653
00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:22.320
you know,
you need to go hunt stuff.
It was the same haircut as me.
Oh yeah,

654
00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:27.560
that's right.
I knew I liked him for some reason.
Yeah,
same haircut.

655
00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:32.330
So I want to bring up something we didn't talk about when we were on vacation

656
00:42:32.331 --> 00:42:36.830
with your family and August,
it was your father's 70th birthday.

657
00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:42.130
And
I don't think we reported this.
We did it.

658
00:42:42.131 --> 00:42:45.760
We must have mentioned this.
Well,
we're going to do it again.
Yeah,
sure.

659
00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:47.600
I think it's hilarious.
It's a good idea.

660
00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:52.190
And it was the 70th birthday and both your sisters and their spouses and your

661
00:42:52.191 --> 00:42:55.430
mother.
All of us were there and well,

662
00:42:55.431 --> 00:43:00.431
why don't you tell the story because this is your brilliant idea was I did,

663
00:43:00.621 --> 00:43:04.700
I first mentioned it or I first write it down for like a card.
I forget.

664
00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:07.310
I think I mentioned it.
I think we were at,
I think,

665
00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:12.330
cause we had dinners the night before and the night of his birthday.

666
00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:16.970
And so it was all of us together.
I said,
Oh,
like mom,

667
00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:21.560
dad turns 70 tomorrow.
Are you going to give him?
Uh,
are you going to 69?

668
00:43:21.561 --> 00:43:26.120
I'm tonight.
And she goes,
[inaudible] 69,
[inaudible] 70.

669
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:29.710
And they go,
no,
are you going to,
are you going to give me a 69 tonight?

670
00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.610
Because this is last night being 69.

671
00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:36.380
And of course there's like giggling at the table.
And my dad's like,

672
00:43:36.381 --> 00:43:40.630
Tommy shaking his head and then everyone starts laughing and she's like,
what?

673
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.850
What?
And she's like,
I said,
what an innocent my mother is.

674
00:43:43.851 --> 00:43:48.350
She really doesn't know no idea what 69 is.
And so like then Maria is like,

675
00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:52.910
ah,
it's something.
Uh,
and my mum was like,
sexually?

676
00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:56.180
And she's like,
yeah.
And she's like,
what?

677
00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:03.210
They're trying to be polite about it.
It's just,
and she's like,
please take me.

678
00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:05.000
And she's like,
okay.
You know,

679
00:44:05.001 --> 00:44:10.001
like a guy puts his mouth down on you and then you go down on him.

680
00:44:11.631 --> 00:44:15.290
And he was like,
what?
So they're like trying to like paint the picture.

681
00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:19.550
Your mom's head is exploding.
Like,
wait,
she can't put it together.

682
00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:23.780
Even fathom what's happening.
And then I,
uh,
you know,

683
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:27.590
once you finally figured it out,
she was like,
oh,
and just,
you know,

684
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:30.770
rolled her eyes and was like,
that just sounds horrific to her.
It's like,

685
00:44:30.771 --> 00:44:31.710
you might as well be like,
can

686
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.710
<v 2>can dad shit in your mouth.
So.
Right.
But then,
uh,</v>

687
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:39.580
later on I go,
hey,
you know what you should do?
Um,

688
00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:43.350
when we get together tomorrow you should be like,
I'm going to go 69 year.

689
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:46.230
Your Dad.
And she was,
she was down with it did,
we had,

690
00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:50.610
we had dinner and she was like,
I'm going to go give 69 nine.
So fun.
But I think,

691
00:44:50.611 --> 00:44:54.300
by the way,
what would be really fun for our listeners,

692
00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:58.350
if any of you,
this is how I propose you do it,

693
00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:01.710
get a camera going or at least an audio recording,

694
00:45:01.711 --> 00:45:06.030
but Campbell would be better and ask your mom regardless of her age,

695
00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:10.980
let's say your mom is 47.
I'd be like,
Hey,
when dad,

696
00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:14.070
when Dad's about to turn 70,
do you think you guys will 69?

697
00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:18.710
<v 0>No.
The night before his 70th birthday on the last night of him being 69.</v>

698
00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:20.420
Will you give him 69?
Yeah.

699
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:21.343
<v 2>Will you guys,</v>

700
00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:26.210
well you guys 69 and just see if they laugh or they get upset

701
00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:31.550
and like if they're over 70 just go like,
Hey,

702
00:45:31.551 --> 00:45:36.140
when dad turned 70 did you 69?
Um,
I guess,
uh,

703
00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:37.430
as a birthday present.

704
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:41.710
<v 0>How birthday ever been?
69 for the last nine.
Yeah.</v>

705
00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:46.630
<v 2>Or if your dad's dead and be like,
if dad was still here,</v>

706
00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:53.080
do you think you'd 69?
I'm on his birthday.
So stupid.
It's so stupid.

707
00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:56.440
<v 0>Well,
cause we were talking about it like,
remember when you were like,</v>

708
00:45:56.441 --> 00:46:01.190
you first heard about what 69 was and you were like 12 or 13 or whatever and you

709
00:46:01.191 --> 00:46:03.620
were like,
Whoa,
we're going to do that all the time.

710
00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:08.410
I'm married and with 69 I just thought that would be the mountain top by a man.

711
00:46:08.411 --> 00:46:13.180
One day,
69 and it'll be the best fucking thing ever.

712
00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:17.080
And then I remember doing it and being like,
this is just not as good.
Well,

713
00:46:17.081 --> 00:46:20.220
because you're doing the work.
And trying to receive the pleasure.
Yeah,

714
00:46:20.221 --> 00:46:22.570
it doesn't,
it's not as good.
It's counterproductive.

715
00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.610
I know cause you want to be like,
okay.

716
00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.650
It's like eating and shooting at the same time.

717
00:46:26.651 --> 00:46:29.770
Like you got to do one or the other.
You can't do both at the same time.
I mean,

718
00:46:29.771 --> 00:46:33.610
you can,
you can't be,
you're not going to enjoy known for it,
but you know.
Yeah.

719
00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:37.830
But you're not going to enjoy either one.
Fully true cause you're,
you're working,

720
00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:41.290
you're doing work.
So it's as much effort.
There's a Jewish prayer for shitting.

721
00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.273
No.

722
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:44.110
<v 2>Um,
from blue ban.</v>

723
00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:48.100
I thought this was bullshit because I've never heard of it and I grew up Super

724
00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:52.780
Jewish,
but it's totally legit.
Hey,
Schindler's was glass in the last episode.

725
00:46:52.781 --> 00:46:55.090
You came across your discussion of the sacred releasing.
Yeah.

726
00:46:55.091 --> 00:46:58.390
That was that guy that was talking about really being present for your shitting

727
00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:01.480
and the need for prayer or squeezing out your chocolate dough.

728
00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:05.560
Let me save you the work.
US Jews beat you to it.

729
00:47:05.561 --> 00:47:07.600
Here's the English translation of the prayer,

730
00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:11.980
usually referred to as the bathroom blessing.
Oh,
bless it.

731
00:47:11.981 --> 00:47:13.540
Are you Lord our God,

732
00:47:13.541 --> 00:47:18.400
King of the universe who fashioned man with wisdom and created within him many

733
00:47:18.401 --> 00:47:20.170
openings and many cavities.

734
00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:24.750
It is obvious and known before your throne of glory that if even one of the

735
00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:29.230
cavities is ruptured,
her blocked,
it would be impossible to survive,

736
00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:30.010
to stand before

737
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:31.900
<v 0>you,
even for a short period of time.</v>

738
00:47:31.901 --> 00:47:36.901
Blessed Are you God who heals all flesh and ax wondrously the prayer is said,

739
00:47:37.481 --> 00:47:38.470
well,
washing your hands,

740
00:47:38.471 --> 00:47:43.150
post brown or yellow rather than during the act of elimination as been

741
00:47:43.151 --> 00:47:46.600
suggested.
Tina,
let me preemptively satiate your curiosity.

742
00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:50.710
If you have diarrhea at the blessing is recited after each instance of said

743
00:47:50.711 --> 00:47:51.544
diarrhea,

744
00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:57.220
f all the haters genes within Gillian Aka hungry tits.
Oh Wow.

745
00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:02.260
That's,
I like jeans with an amazing,
that is interesting.

746
00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:06.220
Why had this might be a good time to bring up my appearance on the Adam Carolla.

747
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:10.630
Oh my God,
this is real shit centric episode today.
Sure is.

748
00:48:10.631 --> 00:48:14.770
It's what we do best.
Yeah.
So I did Carolla show you're,
uh,

749
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.170
promoting mother inferior with which,
uh,

750
00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:21.640
if you have not yet seen a Christina's Netflix special mother,

751
00:48:21.641 --> 00:48:23.140
inferior is uh,

752
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:28.210
where is it mother inferior where it can it be seen on Netflix net flicks.

753
00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:35.460
You can see it all over any of the many hundred thousand countries that now have

754
00:48:35.741 --> 00:48:38.110
Netflix and a,
it's streaming and it's,

755
00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:40.150
it's really great and it's really well received.

756
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:42.440
And so you've been promoting it everywhere.
Um,

757
00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:46.600
and it was nice to meet Adam Carolla because I've been listening to him since

758
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:47.501
forever.

759
00:48:47.501 --> 00:48:51.040
I grew up here in la and back when he was on k rock doing love line and he's

760
00:48:51.041 --> 00:48:55.270
also,
you know,
one of these podcasts,
giants,
man,
I mean sugar,

761
00:48:55.271 --> 00:49:00.270
not crazy.
Yeah,
he's amazing.
Very,
very gracious.
Very kind,
very fine.

762
00:49:00.271 --> 00:49:03.160
So it just spontaneously happened.

763
00:49:03.161 --> 00:49:08.161
We were doing some topics and I happened to get into this with Adam and I

764
00:49:08.351 --> 00:49:10.510
thought you guys might enjoy it.
Yeah.
Adam,

765
00:49:10.511 --> 00:49:14.380
do you have a bad day situation or are you just oh,

766
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:17.200
mashing that poo in near for just rubbing it.

767
00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:20.520
<v 7>My,
my thing is is I will</v>

768
00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:28.730
time the toilet with the shower.
So you know,
I know shit.
The shower to shower.

769
00:49:28.731 --> 00:49:33.680
Yeah,
yeah,
I've done that too.
Now do.
But you do a white before you go shower.

770
00:49:33.681 --> 00:49:37.250
Right.
You don't just surprise myself,
you know,
I like to keep it fresh.

771
00:49:37.251 --> 00:49:39.200
Depends on certain factors.

772
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.871
<v 0>First of all.</v>

773
00:49:40.871 --> 00:49:45.871
I mean I cannot believe you on a brother out there as disgusting as you are if

774
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:50.200
so much in common.
Corollas.
Grandfather was Hungarian as well.

775
00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:54.310
He loves chicken Paprikash and he shits to shower.

776
00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:56.980
Now a lot of us are shamed,
ashamed about it.

777
00:49:56.981 --> 00:50:01.030
But Ari Schaefer and Adam Carolla.
Yeah.
Arie and I,

778
00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:05.860
we're all shit to shower people and I thought it would be nice for all the other

779
00:50:05.861 --> 00:50:06.940
ones out there.
We can,

780
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.470
we can all feel safe knowing that famous people go shit to shower today as well.

781
00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:11.830
I'd like to,
yeah,

782
00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:14.540
<v 7>if I,
if I am staring at,</v>

783
00:50:14.541 --> 00:50:18.230
if I'm literally just going to step off the commode in,
into the shower,

784
00:50:18.231 --> 00:50:20.940
I'll save the paper.
Wow.

785
00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:25.170
Oh you don't show it was so yeah.

786
00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.440
Pool.
I'll

787
00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:33.500
<v 0>go dunk myself in the pool that's in there.
I'll give,
I'll give a hot water.</v>

788
00:50:33.501 --> 00:50:36.930
Good.
Good.
Hot Water Rinse down there.
Yeah.
Good hot water.

789
00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:41.930
Not even an exploratory wipe.
See what,
see what happens.

790
00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:46.670
I get it.
I get it.
You know what I mean?
Been there and done that.

791
00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:51.980
It's not my first ass Rodeo.
It's reminds me of wife Kate.

792
00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:55.940
Remember what?
Okay.
Yeah,
I'm good.
Yeah.

793
00:50:56.150 --> 00:51:00.830
Between skippy peanut butter and Jif peanut butter.
Which do you like?

794
00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:03.500
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

795
00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:07.600
<v 0>Skippy and jiff was Charro and I called her.</v>

796
00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:11.350
<v 3>Oh Geez.
What is,
it may not have been out there.
I liked</v>

797
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.720
did
Jeff Schiff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.

798
00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:26.330
<v 0>And then,
um,
between the shaky parmesan cheese,</v>

799
00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:31.280
the Kraft one or the fresh shaved Parmesan,
which do you like?
Oh,

800
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:35.600
okay.
And then what,
tell me what you think of this,

801
00:51:35.601 --> 00:51:36.720
because I've had this conversation.

802
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:42.080
So when Christina goes to the bathroom,

803
00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:46.670
like goes Gaca.
Okay,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I need,

804
00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:50.840
I need your,
I need you to weigh in on this.
So she goes,

805
00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:54.500
she goes back,
uh,
and then she goes,

806
00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:59.240
she gets up from the toilet and she takes a shower immediately without wiping.

807
00:51:59.241 --> 00:52:03.710
Even once.
I swear to God,

808
00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:04.753
I swear to God.

809
00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:09.410
<v 3>Marty was got a little bit,</v>

810
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:12.430
<v 0>can you please tell me why?
Why you think so?</v>

811
00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:19.260
<v 3>Because it is the only one in the shower.
Showers.</v>

812
00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:24.320
<v 0>Well she says,
okay.
She says,
wait,
wait,</v>

813
00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:29.280
wait.
She says that the shower,
the shower pressure cleans it for her.

814
00:52:31.570 --> 00:52:36.060
Well that's it.
That's another thing.
But do you think you think it's disgusting?

815
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:38.130
It's disgusting.

816
00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:42.600
I don't see the difference between doing what she does and just going got,

817
00:52:42.601 --> 00:52:43.650
got in the shower.

818
00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:46.670
<v 3>Okay,
go.
We both have it.</v>

819
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:53.270
<v 0>I'm not saying to do that.</v>

820
00:52:53.271 --> 00:52:57.760
I'm saying I barely see the difference because it's true.
It's true.
It's,

821
00:52:57.770 --> 00:52:59.930
there isn't,
but there is a difference.
I'm,

822
00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:02.930
I do the Brown in the toilet and like Adam said,
and he bring,

823
00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:06.080
he brought up a really good point is that you know what you're working with.

824
00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:10.310
Yeah.
He knows he's,
I'm 41 years old.
I've been dumping my whole life.

825
00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:14.180
I know what's going on back there.
I know.
I know what's happening.

826
00:53:14.181 --> 00:53:17.870
It's an it's fine.
It's fine.
I did it today.

827
00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:22.700
I did a shit to shower today.
I try to do it every morning.
Okay.

828
00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:26.220
And what's wrong?
I'm trying to set the uh,
nevermind trying to do that.

829
00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:31.320
There again,
problems,
you know,
problems make my dick soft.

830
00:53:31.610 --> 00:53:35.940
Okay.
Uh,
another interesting thing Adam said is that he does not take it.

831
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.900
He doesn't like taking long dumps.
Does he say this here?
That's in the full clip,

832
00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:44.180
just fall off the turnip truck or whatever else we could see.

833
00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:49.220
I asked in front of,
I know to work with and I have,

834
00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:52.590
so I'm so he likes to get it out of the way is what you're saying.
Right.

835
00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:56.130
Expeditious.
He doesn't enjoy the moment.

836
00:53:56.830 --> 00:54:00.270
He doesn't shop online like I do.
Like I do our grocery shopping,

837
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:03.810
I'll pop a few blood vessels when I'm sitting down,
you know,
I don't,

838
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:08.960
I don't want it to go that quickly.
Yeah,
I know.
It's like the me time.

839
00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:10.990
Like we have a toddler,
we have two dogs.
Like,

840
00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:15.330
it's the one moment I have the enjoying my life.
Right.
Um,
how about this?
Uh,

841
00:54:15.331 --> 00:54:18.180
machines within question.
Oh my God,
I love it.
I'm Mommy's,

842
00:54:18.181 --> 00:54:22.830
I've been practicing on what does this Cutler,

843
00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:27.360
the killer clowns flow.
Am I reading this wrong?

844
00:54:27.361 --> 00:54:30.860
Maybe I need to open it up.
No cutter cutter.
Uh,

845
00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:33.960
and I've come to a mental block.
Oh,
that's the guy,
right?

846
00:54:33.961 --> 00:54:37.500
He properly expresses his disgust for haters with the lines f the haters.

847
00:54:37.501 --> 00:54:41.910
F all the haters then follows it up with the line much love know,
hey,
well,

848
00:54:41.911 --> 00:54:44.340
which is it?
What's real?
What's fake?

849
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.090
Maybe he's denouncing haters while rising above it himself.

850
00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:52.320
Could cutter be Jesus or is he just a terminators matrix?

851
00:54:52.770 --> 00:54:57.570
Happy Halloween and Mommy's Brian G,
Geez.
Well,
what a great question.

852
00:54:58.350 --> 00:55:01.260
I mean,
he's right.
It's paradoxical on the one hand,

853
00:55:01.261 --> 00:55:04.770
f all the haters and then he's like all love.
No hate.
If you're wondering,

854
00:55:04.771 --> 00:55:07.050
by the way why this computer is here,
it's smaller.

855
00:55:07.051 --> 00:55:09.030
It doesn't have all the stuff that I normally do.

856
00:55:09.031 --> 00:55:12.510
I had computer problems today has swap it out last second just to do this

857
00:55:12.511 --> 00:55:16.360
episode.
Otherwise,
I'd be playing you some machines within.
But yeah,

858
00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:17.970
but that is a great question.

859
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:23.760
I think it comes down to him just not being very conscious of what he's saying.

860
00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:27.540
You don't think he's on top of what he's saying?
He's a stream of consciousness.

861
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:32.430
Oh right,
right.
It just comes to him.
My flows.

862
00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:36.240
Yeah.
He's kind of in the moment.
I'm walking down the street.
Yeah.

863
00:55:36.241 --> 00:55:39.330
Cause it is right there.
If the haters and all love.

864
00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:43.570
He's just saying so reporting the news from is his mind.
Yeah.

865
00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:46.320
That's what genius do guys.
They can't wow.

866
00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:51.580
Why to compliment machines are then became a smash hit single and it's because

867
00:55:51.871 --> 00:55:55.580
of him in parks.
That's true.
That's really true.
Um,

868
00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:59.580
brainchild.
If you will.
We'll,
we'll,
we'll try to get more,

869
00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:03.940
obviously if he keeps creating content,
we'll keep playing it here.
So maybe,

870
00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:08.080
maybe we'll,
we'll see if he does something in the same vein later.
You know,

871
00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:12.870
it's hard to do two hits in a row.
He reminds me of a little bit.
Tupac.
Yes,

872
00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:18.180
I see it.
I see a lot of Tupac.
Yeah.
One arm question.

873
00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:21.330
My boyfriend and I are hardcore black guys who love to fuck and love your

874
00:56:21.331 --> 00:56:26.310
pockets.
We were thinking to you to,
to Y'all talk,

875
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:30.310
uh,
talk about how to almost people wipe and we got to talking and things.

876
00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:33.730
Those with arms.
We had the question,

877
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:38.500
if a woman has one arm and gets a manicure,
does she pay full price?

878
00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:42.700
What right questions looking forward to your infinite jeans,

879
00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:46.570
wisdom machines within f all the haters.
Much love rub,
rub,
rub,

880
00:56:46.571 --> 00:56:50.590
rub from Holly and bear in Texas.
That is a fantastic question.

881
00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:54.610
Jesus.
That is great.
What do you think of it?

882
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:59.910
We once had a nanny offer us half price Reiki on our eight week old baby because

883
00:57:01.061 --> 00:57:03.520
our son was only eight weeks old.

884
00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:06.160
So normally $100 she could get it to us for 50.

885
00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:11.320
I'm thinking the same logic would apply with half a manicure and it makes sense

886
00:57:11.321 --> 00:57:13.540
half price.
What do you think?
Um,

887
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:18.400
I think it makes sense but there's really like,
I dunno,

888
00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:22.400
there's only one way to really find out.
I think we should call a salon.
Yeah.

889
00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:26.380
Tell them.
My wife only has one arm.
And how much would you charge her?

890
00:57:26.770 --> 00:57:28.840
That's what I'm going to do because that makes,

891
00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:33.460
it's actually a really excellent question and it's one we can find the answer to

892
00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:38.430
Shane's with machines with Oh hey,

893
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:43.360
terminator terminator.
He says 16

894
00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:49.940
again and get terminator gun here.
Go to one of them.

895
00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:53.950
This one,
this one's called nailed it.
Nailed it.
I know.

896
00:57:53.951 --> 00:57:58.300
Or that I pass by it.
So dumb machines with,

897
00:58:00.250 --> 00:58:04.930
oh,
that's right away here.
I've got one here.
Hold on.

898
00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:07.900
There's another one here yet again.

899
00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:12.490
Can get terminated again.
F all the haters.

900
00:58:12.790 --> 00:58:14.140
Haters.
Here we go.

901
00:58:24.050 --> 00:58:26.440
I mean these people,
one of my business or what?
No.

902
00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:29.483
<v 3>Okay.</v>

903
00:58:30.050 --> 00:58:30.460
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

904
00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:34.760
<v 0>Hi,
how are you?
Good.
Um,</v>

905
00:58:35.050 --> 00:58:36.760
what do you charge for a manicure?

906
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:39.240
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

907
00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:44.100
<v 0>Um,
my wife,
I'm trying to surprise her.
She wants a manicure,
but she has one arm.</v>

908
00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:45.960
Does she have to pay full price?

909
00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:52.480
Okay.
For her one arm.

910
00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:54.320
<v 8>Okay.</v>

911
00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:55.550
<v 0>Okay.
And she has one foot,</v>

912
00:58:55.970 --> 00:58:59.850
so can she pay half of the pedicure price too?

913
00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:07.990
<v 8>You know what</v>

914
00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:16.540
is before like that dinner.

915
00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:21.140
<v 0>Okay.
Is that,
that's less than normal though,
right?</v>

916
00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:26.270
That's what I'm saying.
That's the discounted rate.
Yeah.
Cause she's got,

917
00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:30.560
she's got one foot and she's got one arm.
Okay.
That sounds like a great deal.

918
00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:34.990
I'm going to send her there.
Thank you.
All right,
well,

919
00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:39.520
fair enough.
That's very fair.
Very reasonable.
A establishment.
Yeah.

920
00:59:39.790 --> 00:59:41.720
So like I've never had that before.

921
00:59:41.721 --> 00:59:46.060
That's kind of surprising to me that there'd be more people with appendages

922
00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:48.500
missing.
I'm sure there's still only get their nails done.
Yeah.

923
00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:53.400
I don't see why they wouldn't.
I saw a woman with severe arthritis,
um,

924
00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:58.390
getting her nails done.
It was really hard,
but you still want to have nice nails.

925
00:59:58.391 --> 01:00:00.980
Probably still want it.
And she had like Nice rings and stuff.

926
01:00:00.981 --> 01:00:05.270
So he's still on a jazz yourself,
of course.
But that was a really good question.

927
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:09.290
Another good question that came in about Dick Tattoos.
No thought provoker Oh,

928
01:00:09.291 --> 01:00:10.124
interesting.

929
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:14.720
On episode four 21 you talked about weird places for tattoos and mentioned the

930
01:00:14.721 --> 01:00:18.470
poisoned Penis Tattoo.
I really thought about how that Tattoo session went.

931
01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:21.560
I imagined the penis would be,
have to be hard,
but wouldn't.

932
01:00:21.561 --> 01:00:22.910
The pain of the needle hurts so bad.

933
01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:25.430
You'd lose your boner if you did lose your boner.

934
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:28.130
You think the artist made the client go to the bathroom to rub,
rub,

935
01:00:28.131 --> 01:00:31.370
rub or did he close his eyes while the client rubbed that to get hard again?

936
01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:34.780
How many,
well you know,
I wonder if anybody,
this is a,

937
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:37.940
she says you guys are doing good Kelly from Missouri.

938
01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:39.020
It's a great question Kelly.

939
01:00:39.050 --> 01:00:43.640
And if there's any tattoo artists that I've ever done a penis tattoo that could

940
01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:49.130
enlighten us on how that goes and whether or not you have to be erect and if you

941
01:00:49.131 --> 01:00:53.270
lose your erection,
cause I imagine that that does apply there.
You know for sure.

942
01:00:54.110 --> 01:00:59.110
I would imagine flacid and then they would stretch the skin and do it set

943
01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:03.820
because how could you maintain an erection?
But I don't know anything about tech.

944
01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:06.530
I know a lot about dicks and I think about tattooing.

945
01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:11.150
I imagine they like stretch the skin of the penis and then really get in there,

946
01:01:11.151 --> 01:01:14.750
get like the way you're drawing on stretch those nooks and crannies.

947
01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:17.960
Get the ink N.
Yup.
That's a good point.

948
01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:22.850
I don't think it should be.
I,
but I'm not a tattoo artist.
You know,

949
01:01:22.851 --> 01:01:26.120
by the way that when I played this in the earlier in the show,

950
01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:33.080
did you know that that's one of the first drops we played and then this is

951
01:01:33.081 --> 01:01:34.070
actually the same lady.

952
01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:35.173
<v 9>No,</v>

953
01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:40.200
but if the game

954
01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.460
noticing this too,
they just ain't telling y'all damn man,

955
01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.290
this boy told me to tell y'all.

956
01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:51.740
Y'All need to watch on the y'all damn nuts and all around y'all damn nuts.

957
01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:53.693
<v 0>Yeah,
right.</v>

958
01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:57.500
<v 9>And put this boy is saying to tell y'all it,</v>

959
01:01:57.510 --> 01:02:02.400
even if you do not get penetrated and have anal sex,

960
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:07.870
then you still have an obligation to lift your nut sack up and go all under

961
01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:13.170
round the back.
And then they said all around your Dick too.

962
01:02:13.171 --> 01:02:14.730
They said it dig be staking.

963
01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:18.650
<v 0>Yeah.
Isn't that like a it intuitive for everyone?</v>

964
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:23.330
I mean obviously not because she's having to do a PSA about me.

965
01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:27.480
She's saying like even if you don't engage in anal sex to wash your nuts and I'm

966
01:02:27.481 --> 01:02:31.140
not sure what that has to do with anal,
but I don't know.
I think she's,

967
01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:34.250
she's misinformed.
Yeah.
Yeah.

968
01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:48.430
<v 9>This shit got to stop.
He said,
y'all need to wash,</v>

969
01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:53.660
get out at hot,

970
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:57.980
kicked up crops and when y'all shit

971
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:05.410
particles,
the shit and pieces of tissue and shit

972
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:14.370
and don't just depend on that toilet tissue to do the trick.

973
01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:18.070
<v 0>Wow.
Was just a lot of information there.
It's very,
very important.</v>

974
01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:23.080
I feel like everything that she's saying is quite,
quite obvious,
right?

975
01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:27.160
Yeah,
it's true.
It's like ladies and gentlemen,
wear deodorant.

976
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:31.690
Change your underwear every day.
Brush your teeth twice a day,

977
01:03:31.691 --> 01:03:35.280
floss like,
dude,
we get it.
Who's not doing the basics?
Know,

978
01:03:35.530 --> 01:03:36.970
maybe she's just pushing back.

979
01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:41.590
Maybe this is push back against all of the fucking,

980
01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:46.240
uh,
people that have for years now say,
oh,
pussy stink.
Wash your pussy.

981
01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:49.030
Your pussy stinks.
Right?
She's heard that her whole life.
She's like,

982
01:03:49.031 --> 01:03:50.040
fuck you wash your decking.

983
01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:55.080
Which I understand that there is this thing about women's Vaginas just being

984
01:03:55.121 --> 01:03:58.450
smelly,
24,
seven.
It's like,
really?

985
01:03:58.570 --> 01:04:03.280
It shouldn't be unless something is going on,
infections or such,

986
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.680
but yeah,
I'm fucking sick of hearing how,
how stinky vaginas are.
They're not,

987
01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:12.790
I mean,
there are sneaky boxes out there.
I'm sure,
but you know,

988
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:16.210
but what do you expect?
I mean,
come on.
It's the,
it's a portal of life.

989
01:04:16.211 --> 01:04:20.770
You guys can't be perfect.
Come on please.
Here we go.

990
01:04:23.530 --> 01:04:27.840
<v 9>Well y'all bring y'all dick and nuts to go over there and go up in his butt and</v>

991
01:04:27.841 --> 01:04:30.900
go to his house.
We'll be back and we'll ask Alexis la,

992
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:35.170
I didn't know it was like this Nigga ass damn chain.
And y'all

993
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:39.860
say y'all ain't his motherfucking.

994
01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:45.840
<v 0>There you go.
So you're right.
You're right.
Tom,
why you called that one?</v>

995
01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:49.930
I tell you,
I know Dick's and eyeballs.
I know things that smell.
I know it.

996
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.250
That's why it's really my wheelhouse,
man.
It's really,
really good.

997
01:04:53.251 --> 01:04:55.770
We have a dental update.
I mean,
what,

998
01:04:55.771 --> 01:04:59.520
why would you even know why I let the dogs and the kitchen is there dinner time.

999
01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:04.370
Just hold on
for,
I give you our listener dental update.

1000
01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:08.730
You've been saying and actually know what this first came up with.
You know,

1001
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.940
obviously my friend fat,
uh,
Bert who,
um,

1002
01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:17.680
can you imagine if you've seen his mouth right?
All these,
it's a garbage dump.

1003
01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:18.000
Yeah,

1004
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.690
<v 2>it's just,
it's horrific.
And he,
he breathed his teeth.</v>

1005
01:05:22.691 --> 01:05:25.870
Look like Thanksgiving corn.
Yeah,

1006
01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:29.530
the decoration white brown won a gold one.

1007
01:05:29.531 --> 01:05:34.150
It's all different colors.
It's pretty bad.
And He um,

1008
01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:37.600
he breathes really loud.
And you were talking about like,
Hey,

1009
01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:40.120
do you think you probably like,
I know he snores,

1010
01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:43.690
we should call his wife and be like,
yeah,
what's that snoring like?
Sure.

1011
01:05:43.810 --> 01:05:47.740
He doesn't wear a mouth guard at all.
And uh,
I've been wearing one for years,

1012
01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:51.850
which has helped tremendously.
You noticed,
you noted that lately?

1013
01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:53.800
My snoring has gotten louder,

1014
01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:56.230
but I think it's cause I haven't switched my bands out in the wild.

1015
01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:57.430
It's like a switch them out tonight.

1016
01:05:57.670 --> 01:06:01.060
I think you should because the last two nights I've had to poke you and then you

1017
01:06:01.061 --> 01:06:02.290
flip over now.

1018
01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:06.070
And I also think it might be time for a new mouth guard Bay because you've been

1019
01:06:06.610 --> 01:06:10.270
using the same one every night for how many years?
It's a few years now.
Yeah.

1020
01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.450
Yeah.
It's time.
It's time for a new one.
Go to the doctor,

1021
01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:18.010
the dentist and go get a fresh one.
Okay.
Or get get backups too.
Maybe too.

1022
01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:21.850
It's a good idea.
I'm surprised you haven't,
I don't want to jinx it,

1023
01:06:21.851 --> 01:06:25.510
but you haven't lost this one.
I've been,
I've had panic attacks about losing it,

1024
01:06:25.511 --> 01:06:29.020
so I probably should get it back up or make this the backup and get a fresh one.

1025
01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:32.530
Get a freshie.
You deserve it.
Thanks.
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to do it.

1026
01:06:32.650 --> 01:06:33.430
I really love it.

1027
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:37.690
And actually there are times now to say I get into a hotel and I'm like,
Oh,

1028
01:06:37.691 --> 01:06:41.710
I'm so tired.
I got to take a nap.
Yeah,
I just won't even open my bag.

1029
01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:45.100
I don't sleep as well.
Like I,
I mentally,

1030
01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:48.430
it's not as comfortable now cause you're used to that.

1031
01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:51.760
I'm used to it being there.
It's like wearing your retainer or your headgear,

1032
01:06:51.761 --> 01:06:54.850
you know,
this isn't a plug for,
you know,
I'm not saying,

1033
01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:59.620
I'm not telling you about one,
I'm just saying that like if you do snore and,

1034
01:06:59.621 --> 01:07:04.120
uh,
you want to have a more comfortable,
fuller night of sleep,

1035
01:07:04.690 --> 01:07:08.440
this is what has helped me and it helps the person that sleeps next to me

1036
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:12.910
professionally.
Yay.
No,
you go to the doctor.
They did a mold done.
Yeah,

1037
01:07:12.911 --> 01:07:16.360
it's a whole thing.
The whole thing.
They're very upset.
All right.

1038
01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:19.220
We'll take them in a moment.
We'll take them in a moment.
We're almost done.
Okay.

1039
01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:24.040
So yeah,
go ahead.
Here are,
um,
yeah,
I,
anyways,

1040
01:07:24.070 --> 01:07:28.390
I'm going to get it done.
You deserve a fresh one.
I'm brushing lot.

1041
01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:30.570
I floss my teeth whitened.

1042
01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:36.820
I will say that your teeth and your special look much wider and I think people

1043
01:07:36.821 --> 01:07:41.140
are really going to be dazzled by how thin you look and how white your teeth.

1044
01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:44.270
Well,
I definitely looked at,
if you look side by side,
the last one.
Yeah,

1045
01:07:44.890 --> 01:07:46.440
it's definitely different.
It's really,
it's,

1046
01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:49.930
I think people are going to be really dazzled by how great you look in this new

1047
01:07:49.931 --> 01:07:52.870
special,
especially.
Well,
I think if they did,
if they've never seen me before,

1048
01:07:52.871 --> 01:07:56.860
there'll be like,
who's that fat guy?
But if you know me from before,

1049
01:07:56.861 --> 01:08:00.700
you'll be like,
oh,
he looks better.
It looks way better.
Yeah.
Um,

1050
01:08:00.850 --> 01:08:03.220
here's another email we got.
We get done.
We'll updates all the time.

1051
01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:05.440
As a reminder to anybody who listens to the show.

1052
01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:08.230
If you ever want to send in the song,
if you ever want to send in the link,

1053
01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.060
if you ever want us to watch a video,

1054
01:08:10.210 --> 01:08:11.740
if you're want to give us an edit dental update,

1055
01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:16.070
the email is always don't do Facebook,
don't direct message.

1056
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:19.520
Don't you always hit us up at the g mail address?

1057
01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:21.620
That's the official email address.

1058
01:08:21.621 --> 01:08:24.350
We have thousands of emails and they've all come in through there.

1059
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:25.310
That's where we check them.

1060
01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:29.760
It's your mom's podcast@gmail.com we did.

1061
01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:31.100
There's no house in the address.

1062
01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:35.600
Your mom's podcast@gmail.com here's the email.

1063
01:08:35.601 --> 01:08:39.920
Hey Mommy's,
my name is Brandon and I have a dental update for you.

1064
01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:43.790
I've been listening to the show for a few years now and I used to fast forward

1065
01:08:43.791 --> 01:08:47.060
past the dental updates because I was ashamed of my teeth,

1066
01:08:48.170 --> 01:08:51.320
27 years old and my teeth were starting to look like I've been eating rocks all

1067
01:08:51.321 --> 01:08:53.840
my life.
I didn't have dental insurance,

1068
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:55.820
so I didn't go to the dentist for over 10 years.

1069
01:08:56.210 --> 01:09:01.210
The early onset dad mouth was real and my jeans were pretty low and loose.

1070
01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:05.330
It got so bad that I wouldn't smile with my teeth and it was affecting my self

1071
01:09:05.331 --> 01:09:08.840
esteem and happiness.
After I got a new job with good insurance,

1072
01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:13.520
my triple d slut wife who has a great set of chompers on her convince me to go

1073
01:09:13.521 --> 01:09:16.820
to the dentist to see what we could do to get the ball rolling on fixing my

1074
01:09:16.821 --> 01:09:17.654
teeth.

1075
01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:22.670
That along with years of dental shaming from the main mommies.
Good,
good.

1076
01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.470
Finally made my appointment with,

1077
01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:27.480
so we started with a cleaning and I looked like a bloody mass after clean.

1078
01:09:27.481 --> 01:09:31.280
That lasted about an hour.
The dentist then did an evaluation.

1079
01:09:31.490 --> 01:09:33.860
I had 16 fucking cavities.

1080
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:39.650
The good news is over the course of two months,
I got all 16 fillings.

1081
01:09:39.651 --> 01:09:42.980
I am now finally cavity free.
No longer ashamed to smile.

1082
01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:47.840
I didn't know how good the white fillings would look.

1083
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:49.400
I just wanted to thank you,

1084
01:09:49.670 --> 01:09:53.960
Tom and Christina for shaming me for years and being a contributing factor to

1085
01:09:53.961 --> 01:09:55.970
force me to go to the dentist and making my smile.

1086
01:09:55.971 --> 01:09:57.380
Something not to be ashamed of.

1087
01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:02.150
You've had a positive influence on my life and I'm glad my wife and I found your

1088
01:10:02.151 --> 01:10:03.860
show on top of the teeth.

1089
01:10:03.861 --> 01:10:08.720
You helped me and my wife br gross ourselves ever making farts acceptable around

1090
01:10:08.721 --> 01:10:12.500
each other,
which has undoubtedly gotten us closer as a couple.
Anyway,

1091
01:10:12.501 --> 01:10:13.640
sorry for the long email,

1092
01:10:13.641 --> 01:10:18.020
but I just wanted to say sincerely thanks jeans Brandon from North Carolina.

1093
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:21.590
How about that?
It's so true.
You know,
when I got my veneers done,

1094
01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:27.040
the gentlemen who did them sent that people have to relearn how to smile when

1095
01:10:27.501 --> 01:10:29.880
they get their teeth fixed because the,

1096
01:10:29.881 --> 01:10:34.881
the muscles actually go wonky because you're covering and teeth when you smell

1097
01:10:35.181 --> 01:10:38.990
or you don't smile at all.
I have a cousin like that.
I don't want to out them,

1098
01:10:38.991 --> 01:10:42.750
but I have a customer.
Could you imagine?
You're not smiling?
Yeah,

1099
01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:45.890
I mean we don't that often,
but it's not good.

1100
01:10:45.891 --> 01:10:47.960
I'm saying to restrict yourself from smiling this time.

1101
01:10:48.570 --> 01:10:51.260
Could you imagine psychologically it's very devastating.

1102
01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:54.260
It's gotta be devastating.
Um,
this is a,

1103
01:10:54.261 --> 01:10:57.860
I'm always a fan of a coach that goes over the top.

1104
01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:02.270
This is a youth co youth hockey coach.
Um,

1105
01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:07.460
Littleton Hockey Association removed.
Uh,
it's this,

1106
01:11:07.461 --> 01:11:11.860
this coach from the team.
This is youth,
a youth coach.
Um,

1107
01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:16.610
it has come to our attention of video involving one of our coaches.
Um,
and,

1108
01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:19.860
and one of their assistants has been circulating through social media

1109
01:11:21.370 --> 01:11:25.920
that says that they basically found this to be completely unacceptable.

1110
01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:28.440
I find it to be completely hilarious.

1111
01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.170
And this is the coach in the locker room given the pregame speech.

1112
01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:33.970
<v 4>Okay,</v>

1113
01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:50.660
<v 2>I'm this kid right here,
ear to ear smile.
Like this is the best.</v>

1114
01:11:50.661 --> 01:11:53.270
Like loving my coach talking like this.
Yeah,

1115
01:12:04.770 --> 01:12:05.980
<v 4>it's going to be a good,</v>

1116
01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:16.050
<v 2>I don't see what's wrong with it,
honestly,
and he's fired up.
Am I wrong?</v>

1117
01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:17.070
I know I'm wrong.

1118
01:12:17.071 --> 01:12:20.280
He also knows of the kids aren't threatened because they're like laughing.

1119
01:12:20.281 --> 01:12:21.480
They're laughing.
It's funny.

1120
01:12:22.810 --> 01:12:24.540
<v 4>I have no idea where I'm headed with this.</v>

1121
01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:42.120
<v 2>You said,
fuck the other team.
Fuck their coaches.</v>

1122
01:12:42.121 --> 01:12:46.450
Fuck their wives and all these kids go.
They can hear us.
That's the best.
Yeah.

1123
01:12:47.410 --> 01:12:52.410
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

1124
01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:04.280
<v 2>that's so great that that coach said something there.</v>

1125
01:13:04.381 --> 01:13:06.000
He goes,
they're going to,
we're going to beat them so bad.

1126
01:13:06.001 --> 01:13:07.230
They're going to wish something.

1127
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:12.590
The best version of that I ever heard was a football player one time said in an

1128
01:13:14.281 --> 01:13:15.930
interview.
He said,

1129
01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:20.250
I want to hit people so hard that they don't want to play football anymore.

1130
01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:24.690
That's a really good idea.
I was like,
Holy Shit.
I guess the most intense,

1131
01:13:24.691 --> 01:13:26.760
something like that,
but can I tell you something?

1132
01:13:26.761 --> 01:13:29.190
In order to win in life and in order to succeed,

1133
01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:33.180
you do kind of have to have that killer.
Oh,
this guy played in the NFL.

1134
01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:36.690
But that'd be thinking to think about that.
People say things like,

1135
01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:40.080
I want to hit guys so hard.
They shit their pants right.

1136
01:13:40.190 --> 01:13:43.380
I want to hit them so hard.
I knocked her helmet off.
This guy said,

1137
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:45.270
I want to hit people so hard.

1138
01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:49.760
They don't want to play football anymore like they want quit the gang like that.

1139
01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:53.460
That's inspirational.
I don't,
it motivates me.
I feel inspired.

1140
01:13:53.461 --> 01:13:58.460
His name is Ernie Sims.
That's who said that?
Yeah.
My Dad used to say,
um,

1141
01:13:59.670 --> 01:14:04.450
uh,
fuck,
Oh fuck,
oh fuck cups with Lasik.

1142
01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:09.300
A fight.
I'm going to hit your head so hard.
It's going to fall off.
Oh Wow.

1143
01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:12.940
I'm going to hit you so hard.
Your head's gonna fall off.
All right.

1144
01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:17.710
Different a path that I was going down.
Yeah.
Let's talk more in sports.
Oh,
right.

1145
01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:21.670
But I mean,
it just,
it rung a bell in,
in me.
Yeah.
And inspirational.

1146
01:14:21.730 --> 01:14:26.490
That is inspiring.
Yeah.
And did that ever happen?
No.
No,
no.
Then that's,
yeah,

1147
01:14:26.530 --> 01:14:29.840
but they threaten you with it.
Hungarian go a long way though.
Yeah.

1148
01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:33.070
Threats are good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
yeah.
All right.

1149
01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:37.480
Well I think that's it for today,
gene.
It was definitely a fun,
by the way,

1150
01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:40.420
I forgot about skippy.
Skippy all day.
Fuckers.

1151
01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.880
Don't you just show me an Osha Jeff.
Crap.

1152
01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:47.440
Skippy all mother fucking day and shaky cheese all day.
There's a,

1153
01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:51.070
there's a bunch of songs,
but I have to close on the gaping dad song.
Yeah,

1154
01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:54.370
of course.
I mean,
it sounds here,
but it's like a medley of all great things.
Yeah.

1155
01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:58.570
It's so great.
Um,
thank you all.
Oh,
don't forget this.
By the way,

1156
01:14:59.650 --> 01:15:04.600
in our store,
the Christmas sweater is 100% profit to charity.

1157
01:15:04.930 --> 01:15:07.150
We're doing the children's Hospital of Los Angeles.

1158
01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:11.410
So there's multiple Christmas products and there's obviously other,
you know,

1159
01:15:11.411 --> 01:15:14.800
we have shirts.
I have signed vinyl,
mostly stories sign,

1160
01:15:14.801 --> 01:15:19.690
completely normal sign the vinyl,
there's albums,
there's shirts.
And we have,

1161
01:15:19.691 --> 01:15:23.950
um,
some,
uh,
holiday stuff.
Like Santa Claus is black.

1162
01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:26.800
Santa Claus is Asian,
Santa Claus is Latino.

1163
01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:31.760
And we have a Santa Claus wears jeans,
a hat,
like a winter hat,
you know?
Yeah.

1164
01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:35.440
It's great.
I mean,
the quality on it,
it's like a Sony.

1165
01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:38.350
It's the patterns sewn in.
It's not a bullshit thing.

1166
01:15:38.351 --> 01:15:42.070
But if you see the Christmas sweater that says Santa Claus wears jeans,
yeah,

1167
01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:46.450
that's all going to charity.
That's awesome.
So,
um,
and we'll,
you know,
we'll,

1168
01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:51.340
we'll document it will show you like however we get the toys or just give them

1169
01:15:51.341 --> 01:15:55.060
the,
the money.
It'll be like,
well,
we'll video it and put it up so you can see.

1170
01:15:55.061 --> 01:15:58.270
It will start your holiday shopping.
Now you guys,
these are going to go fast.

1171
01:15:58.271 --> 01:16:03.190
Yeah.
Uh,
the,
the genes one will sell out really soon.
Yeah,
I'm for sure.

1172
01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:04.870
All right.
That's it.

1173
01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:09.040
Thank you guys again for listening and we'll see you next week.
Bye Jean.
