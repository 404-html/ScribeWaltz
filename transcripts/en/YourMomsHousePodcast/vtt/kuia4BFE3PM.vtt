I don't like Facebook and I don't like the Internet because I can't find a job.

61
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.580
The library blocked my password.

68
00:05:28.111 --> 00:05:28.200

Yup.</v>

74
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.330
<v 4>Um,
but back to my point,
how does the library,
I'm sorry,</v>

75
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.450
the library block ones pass.
Well,
I think you need to get the first,

76
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.590
<v 0>cause I,
I have a little experience with this,
uh,
ladies,
don't you?</v>

77
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.670
This lady,
by the way,

78
00:05:58.671 --> 00:06:03.671
for people listening is going up to a town hall hearing.

79
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.370
We're about an issue of where basically,
you know,
there's the,

80
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.980
the people that have power,
right?

81
00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:13.280
The city commissioners and whatever their titles are,

82
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.550
and then there's an audience of members of the public and then you kind of can

83
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:25.031
take your turn to walk up to the mic and address the issue at hand.

84
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.960
Yeah.
So,
yeah,
go ahead.

85
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.230
<v 4>Just,
I'm very excited because I have a very good observation.
Yeah.
Um,
the,</v>

86
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.220
the rock quality.
Yeah.
Is that what you're going to go to?
Yeah,
really.

87
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.420
I think the common denominator with a really great why I'm h Lady Club,

88
00:06:40.421 --> 00:06:43.900
we've already determined what the guys are who are Bra quality.
No Bra,

89
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.260
no Bra,
and the biggest sloppers you've ever seen.
Yeah,

90
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.840
and they're not young slobbers like they've got to be 40 plus.
Oh yeah,
no,

91
00:06:52.841 --> 00:06:57.841
they got some miles on him and then she's got like the ridiculous chain around

92
00:06:58.391 --> 00:07:02.170
her neck.
Oh yeah,
like keys.
Yeah.
It's like a key card.

93
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.140
It's an official thing.
Like a laminate.
It's your qualifications.

94
00:07:08.141 --> 00:07:11.970
Her life calls.
Yeah.
Let's go.
Let's see.

And why Whitner Wagman Ooh,</v>

96
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:21.700
I just moved here because I'm getting a divorce and it's not final till

97
00:07:22.221 --> 00:07:27.221
September 18th my husband will not give me any money.

98
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:32.120
Not One penny.
The lawyer won't help me.

99
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.550
My husband won't help me.
Sure.
My Dad,
Marlin Leigh Widmer,

100
00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:40.970
he's a minister.
Won't help me.
Yeah.

101
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.000
My step mother won't help me.

102
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:48.560
My mother passed away seven years ago.
Ma'Am,

103
00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:53.561
we're discussing the rezoning for the Portello's DMA comments on that for what

104
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.920
we're discussing.
The rezoning.
Third four well,

105
00:07:57.921 --> 00:08:01.040
I live on 63rd again,

106
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:06.080
we're here to hear comments about the rezoning.
Well,
I don't like Facebook.

107
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:07.563
Okay.

108
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.880
And I don't like the Internet because I can't find a job.

109
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:17.480
The library blocked my password.
Now tell me,

110
00:08:17.481 --> 00:08:20.180
does that make any sense to you?

111
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.530
<v 4>No,
it actually does.</v>

112
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:27.270
When I think that the library,

113
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:31.050
I believe the library may have issues with her.

114
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:35.340
I think she probably earned that block.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They blocked her password.
Tom,

115
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.350
how do they block your password?
I don't know.
It makes no sense.

116
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.370
Can you imagine being one of these people on this panel?

117
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.350
What do you have a password for at the library?
That's what I'm saying.

118
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:48.150
I guess to get into,
to look at the Internet and stuff.
Oh,
right,
right,
right.

119
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.800
That's why she doesn't like the Internet anymore.

120
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:55.430
She's there talking about her marital problems and shit and my husband won't

121
00:08:55.621 --> 00:09:00.000
help me give her a penny.
My step mom won't help me.
A Nice,
by the way,

122
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:05.010
in a divorce,
even a divorce.
She just needs to be heard today.
That's my favorite.

123
00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:08.760
I wouldn't do that to you.
You know,
can we,
you know,

124
00:09:08.761 --> 00:09:12.120
this morning I was like,
I was like,
Babe,

125
00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:15.750
I love you and want to stay married forever.
Please.
Let's never divorce.

126
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.870
And you were just like,
oh,
there's a new Verizon that opened up down the street.

127
00:09:19.871 --> 00:09:22.890
And I'm like,
I'm looking for reassurance.

128
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.350
I'm looking for,
I love you will never get a divorce.
Can you say that to me,

129
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:29.610
Tom?
Well,

130
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:35.200
so because it was in the city of Davenport acad she was the city of Davenport.

131
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.700
Do you know where that is?
I don't care.
It's a divorce town for you.

132
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.880
Hello?
Are we going to stay together forever or not you?

133
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.810
I mean everything happens for a reason to stop it.

134
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.590
No crime.
Not getting a divorce.
No,
we're not going to get the word.

135
00:09:54.591 --> 00:09:57.570
Why don't we get a divorce?
I'm just making sure that you're in it to win it.

136
00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:02.460
I am.
We have children together.
I know,
but some people don't care.
I got,
I mean,

137
00:10:02.461 --> 00:10:06.330
I'm saying,
I don't know what's out there.
You know,

138
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:11.160
you know it's out there.
Road beef.
Yeah.

So a dumb you keeping your options open.

Let me tell you something.
Let me tell you something.

142
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.880
What woman out there is going to clean out your ear hair?
Like

143
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.430
here's the deal,
man.
I need to be soft a lot there.
Do you know that?

144
00:10:35.431 --> 00:10:37.940
That's a clip that I still think about a lot to try out.

145
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.740
Think about him all the time.
I still think about him.

146
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.770
I think about my grandfather and him the most weight,
but I'm,

147
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.050
I'm trying to make a point,

148
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.320
which is we were at Starbucks yesterday and I noticed you are growing dad ear

149
00:10:52.321 --> 00:10:55.560
hair.
You're not even 40 but you're a dad and that's what happens.

150
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.960
And then later that day I cleaned out your ear hair for you in the kitchen.
Oh,

151
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.540
that's love.
You love me.
Yeah.
Like Chris Rock says new.

152
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.520
He's not going to clean out your fucking ear hair.
Yes he does.
He says new pussy.

153
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.120
He says as your,
your hair.
But you're nasty.

154
00:11:12.121 --> 00:11:16.470
You got to hear here and know his hair.
Yeah,
I know,
I know.
I know.

155
00:11:16.471 --> 00:11:20.250
And here's the other thing,
new.
He doesn't like it.
They're like,
oh yeah,

156
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.750
they're always like your ear hair cause you do you think you could fucking trim

157
00:11:24.751 --> 00:11:27.330
your ear here before I bought the bang bus and I'm like,
yeah,
yeah.

158
00:11:27.331 --> 00:11:28.164
Hold on a second.

159
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.740
I can't even carry more.

160
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.560
How many times a day do you think I say,

161
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:41.520
are you even listening to me when you're on your iPhone yet you're listening to

162
00:11:41.521 --> 00:11:44.550
me.
Yeah,
I'm here.
I can hear you.
That's fucking hear you fine

163
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.300
your hair.
Fuck.
You know the funny thing is somebody mentioned to you,

164
00:11:51.301 --> 00:11:56.230
you have like crazy ear hair.
You,
you immediately can't stop thinking about it.

165
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.760
I know you said it was,
you can't,
you can't pull it out really.
You know,

166
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:01.060
like you're just like,
wait,

167
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:04.900
there's hair growing out of my ears right now and you are such a dad about it.

168
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:10.000
What are you listening to me?
Yes,
I'm listening to you.
God.
Constant.

169
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:14.410
It's like having a teenager.
Um,
and I,
I kept,

170
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:19.060
I pulled it a little so you could feel where it was done.
Yeah,
I know.

171
00:12:19.061 --> 00:12:22.450
But then you still couldn't get it on your own.
What good is it here?

172
00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:27.451
And you kept like digging in the tremor and like get with the program to add.

173
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.500
I know.
And then I asked you to give me head scratchies last night.

174
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.250
You love head scratches.
That's our currency.
Yeah.
But here's the thing.

175
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.800
Some people will understand this and then some people won't,

176
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:44.320
but so for those of you that don't know,

177
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:48.700
she loves like head scratch it.
So what happens is you need,

178
00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:53.050
like if you're laying in bed,
you need it to be where your hand naturally lays.

179
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:58.150
Nobody.
No,
that's the only way he'll gimme scratchies is if you,
if you,

180
00:12:58.151 --> 00:13:00.580
you're like,
yeah,
yeah,
as long as your head is right here,

181
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.680
that's a reasonable thing to right here.

182
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:07.780
But you can't like bend your arm.
Okay.
That's what the elbows for.
No,

183
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.280
this is not comfortable to sit there and scratch like this.
So I just want like,

184
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:15.710
Hey,
could you be here?
So you were here and all I did was,
oh my God,

185
00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:20.570
just your head.
No.
Yeah,

186
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:24.860
I was falling asleep.
You're scratching and then you go,
you push my head like,

187
00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:29.760
like you push one of the dogs like I was a Brussels girl.
Fine.
I then pushed me.

188
00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:33.670
I didn't go like this.
No,
no.
You were here and I just went like this.
Like a dog.

189
00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.090
Like I was one of the dogs.
And then you got continued head scratches.

190
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.980
Not for long.
They were very poor quality.
Oh,
okay.
They were set apart.

191
00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:44.590
Scratchies I mean,
you're talking shit about the scratchies you're getting,

192
00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:45.670
they weren't very good.

193
00:13:45.671 --> 00:13:48.820
He gave up and you think I fall asleep when I don't notice on the bagging bus.

194
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.440
Everybody is appreciative.
All right.

195
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.830
You don't give head scratches to those slots.
I,
they don't get scratched.

196
00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:00.220
That's a wife move.
But scratchies as soon as they,

197
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.510
as soon as they mentioned head scratches,

198
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.930
we opened the bus where we just throw her plus her head out here.

199
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:13.630
Get out of here.
Lot Lizard take.
Yeah,
yeah,

200
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.240
yeah.
So we've been getting into,
you know,
we were like,
we're,
we,

201
00:14:18.241 --> 00:14:19.960
we finished it or dirty John.

202
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:25.470
And you're watching what's that show called now on Netflix borrowed you.

203
00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:31.450
You fucking love that.
She now,
but I haven't gotten anything ripped through it.

204
00:14:31.451 --> 00:14:33.610
I'm done.
Okay.
So I need to start watching that.

205
00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:38.090
So what we did is we found season one of 90 day fiance.
Yeah.

206
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.050
Which was a great move.
I got to say,
you know,

207
00:14:41.051 --> 00:14:43.590
we get into these shows and they've been on for awhile and I'm like,

208
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.360
I don't want to watch the old season.
You know,
and then you realize,

209
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.030
well that's why you're on this new season.
Cause the old seasons.
Good.
Yeah.

210
00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.670
Fantastic.
Great show.

211
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:57.140
Now the problem with the early episodes of 90 day fiance is that they actually

212
00:14:57.141 --> 00:15:01.040
find intrinsically good girl.
Yeah.

213
00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:06.050
I like that.
They found like nice girls that actually love these guys.

214
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:07.910
It's really weird.
I don't like that.

215
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:11.760
So there's this fucking Dork who's from out here.
They're all doors,

216
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:16.370
he's a Mormon and he's God fucking smoke show.

217
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:21.200
That would definitely make Josh come and he's just like,

218
00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:24.520
well he's a fucking 30 he's like,
ah,

219
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.320
I'm Mormon and I'm going to wait until marriage.

220
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:32.210
So he has his dork friend come over and chaperone them and he's like,

221
00:15:32.211 --> 00:15:34.850
you lay here and make sure I don't go crazy and fucker

222
00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:42.960
the night with his friend in the living room and she's like a 20 year old girl

223
00:15:43.461 --> 00:15:44.330
from Brazil,

224
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.760
a tiny favela as shit dog talent.

225
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:53.110
She's never even had running water in her house.
And so he,
you know,
show higher

226
00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:58.340
teenager.
No,
she's not.
She's like,

227
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:04.100
I've never,
and he's like,

228
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:08.120
this is the hot water.
She is called built to spin on a Knob,

229
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:13.760
80 pounds.
She's tiny little Phillips,
like a Chihuahua.

230
00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:19.150
I mean if Josh couldn't come with her then,
then nobody can come down.

231
00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:23.750
No,
no,
no.
Yeah.
Anyways,
yeah.
This dork had his fucking nerd friend.

232
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:27.170
Why then why are you bringing these floods over here if you're not banging them?

233
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.070
And then another nurse,
I thought that would be like the pay toll,
you know,

234
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.210
that's a tall,
that's the price you pay for bringing over the,

235
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:37.310
I was like rubbing my hands go like,
oh,
he's going to fuck so much right now.

236
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.080
And then.
Then there's another Dork,
the Colombian girl.

237
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.560
Now she's built her fuck gorge and she comes over.
She's like,

238
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.960
I'm ready to pay the price.
She was like,

239
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.700
my morning

240
00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:01.520
coming my hair.
She's made a comment.
She goes,
and then I get these CTC shape,

241
00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:05.390
right?
He's like,
absolutely,
sweetie,
whatever you up.
Yeah.
No.
She's like,

242
00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:07.640
she actually really proud more than he does.

243
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:12.760
She's in him and he lives in Oklahoma with his mommy and daddy and he's 27 years

244
00:17:14.361 --> 00:17:16.630
old.
I'm like,
Bro,
you brought this chick over.

245
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.330
Go Invest in renting apartment in Oklahoma where I'm sure you can get an

246
00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:24.170
apartment for $10 a month or whatever.
The cost of living.
Is there another,

247
00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:25.070
this is,

248
00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:30.070
I think we just saw solve the Josh dilemma was that we're for potter.

249
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:35.070
Yeah.
Used to be on one of these sites and bring over a fucking foreign,

250
00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:39.860
a foreign come dog dog who,
great idea who's like,

251
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:42.770
I want the American life is like,

252
00:17:42.771 --> 00:17:47.630
I need to come and then perfect exchange set up.
Well,
that is the exchange.

253
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.650
It's I want American life.
Well,

254
00:17:49.651 --> 00:17:53.040
I need to come peanut butter and chocolate go well together.

255
00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:01.290
You fuck a lot.
I let you stay.
Exactly.

256
00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.920
And here's the best part is that you don't have to be wealthy.

257
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.790
You just need to have an apartment and a mattress on the floor,

258
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.090
like an air mattress.
These tricks are fine.
They're totally fine.
They're like,

259
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.570
it has air in it.
They're really impressed.

260
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.400
Especially some of these real third worlders like the Philippines,

261
00:18:20.401 --> 00:18:23.250
like those chicks are just happy to have a roof over their head.

262
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:28.230
This Brazilian checks.
Now the Russians are a little more high Falutin.

263
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:32.650
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Well she's,
you know,
she's obviously a spy but she,

264
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:37.050
she,
she kind of eyeballs things.

265
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.990
She also does the slow play with him.
She's like,

266
00:18:39.991 --> 00:18:44.730
we're not going to fuck right away.
Right?
No,
she smiled.
No,
we'll wait a minute.

267
00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:50.070
Yeah,
but I think a lot of those season one,
a couples are still together.

268
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.710
I think you're right.
Cause they picked nice girls.
They didn't,

269
00:18:52.711 --> 00:18:56.200
they figured it out.
They figure it out.
As the seasons progressed,

270
00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:01.120
like we got to get some fucking psychopath,
some real users and users,
man,

271
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.010
shit to watch,
trying to make a love show now.

272
00:19:05.011 --> 00:19:09.690
And so what's even crazier is that,
um,
my,
my,

273
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.160
so embarrassing,

274
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:16.190
I found a picture of my dad's recent wedding yeah.

275
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:21.450
To his 90 day fiance.
Wild.
And let me tell Ya,

276
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:25.530
like my dad's literally living this TV show.
Yeah.

277
00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:27.720
And I haven't,
I haven't met her,

278
00:19:27.721 --> 00:19:32.050
I'm not talking currently to my dad for a few reasons we won't get into on this

279
00:19:32.051 --> 00:19:35.280
show.
But,
um,
I saw a picture of my new mom.

280
00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.000
And what do you think?
She's pretty,

281
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.950
she's a real young in her thirties and they're wearing like,

282
00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:47.880
um,
Vietnamese traditional wedding.

283
00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.830
But at the cool thing is my dad went comfy cause he's wearing as good sneakers.

284
00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:57.800
So the wedding
she's paying that toll.
Right.

285
00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:02.080
So I definitely thinking she's,
she's paying the common goal.

286
00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:07.080
That's exactly what it has to be.
Right.
Because he's probably like,

287
00:20:07.081 --> 00:20:11.430
I want somebody to cook and clean,
but also somebody I can fuck.
And she's like,

288
00:20:11.431 --> 00:20:16.290
great,
I don't like Vietnam.
Sounds good to me.
I like to live in the valley.

289
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.040
Number two,
if you're out there,
hey

290
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:26.880
you can,
you could get an American,
you don't need those are for nerds dude.
Okay.

291
00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:30.930
The 90 day fiance,
they're all fucking dorks.
You're a celebrity.

292
00:20:30.931 --> 00:20:34.260
You know what I'm saying?
Right.
You get some American pig.
Okay.

293
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.780
What do you think she would be like?
What do you think it would seriously,

294
00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.950
well if I was,
if my dad's step mom,
if I was on number two,

295
00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.340
what would it be like?
What you think she would mind telling you?

296
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.040
I definitely not a foreign girl.
No,
cause you're too American.

297
00:20:48.041 --> 00:20:50.770
Like you are American.
You like American.
Yeah,

298
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.170
you like blonds but she'd have to be real dumb.

299
00:20:56.171 --> 00:20:59.340
I'm telling you like you want a Dalmatian,
one of the fuck do I need it?

300
00:20:59.341 --> 00:21:02.500
That was the first wife is always like the real life and then the second wife is

301
00:21:02.501 --> 00:21:06.700
like the no static wife.
Like,
all she wants to do is like yoga all day.

302
00:21:06.701 --> 00:21:09.040
And she's like,
I am in tig,
gluten free diet.

303
00:21:09.041 --> 00:21:11.260
And she just talks about keenwah or whatever.

304
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:14.530
And then you strap on her conversations and she's like,

305
00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.610
I've tried to get Todd to lose weight eating way too much dairy.

306
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:23.170
No,
but all she does.
Yeah.
She's like a yoga instructor.
Yeah.
All right,
cool.

307
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.760
That's all she does tolerate our children home.
You owe no man.

308
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.140
No,
I don't know.

309
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:37.060
Tolerate that kids.
They,
she's not,
she doesn't want a kid,
right?
Might be at mom.

310
00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.300
No,
no,
no,
no.
My second wife.
Oh No,
they always want kids.

311
00:21:40.301 --> 00:21:43.210
That's a problem with the second wife.
What about Mike?
That's the,
that's the,

312
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.430
so here's the problem with my new Vietnam too,

313
00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.430
is that she's probably young enough.
Mom.

314
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:54.700
Mom is great.
Yeah.
But she definitely,

315
00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:57.070
cause I think she's still Blair's my Viet mom.

316
00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:04.450
Yeah.
She's definitely wanting kids and he's got to be,

317
00:22:04.451 --> 00:22:09.190
he's 72 so that's not even ethical.
Right.

318
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.460
It's not ethical.
Fifth Grade,
your dad's 82

319
00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:19.450
that's it.
Hold back.
It doesn't hold some people back,
but it's not cool.

320
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.660
High School graduation.
Oh my God,
you're great.
Great.
Granddad came.

321
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:28.480
Um,
yeah,
but the second wife is always,

322
00:22:28.481 --> 00:22:32.020
she always wants kids so you have to do it again.
Look at Alec Baldwin.
He's on,

323
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:36.460
he's there.
Five words.
Yeah,
he's 60.

324
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:40.300
He's got a new family.
Those kids won't know him very well.

325
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:43.400
What about my second husband?
Let's talk about it.
What is what,

326
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.830
what do you think would have a B is second husband.
If you're the woman,

327
00:22:47.831 --> 00:22:50.020
his second husband at down man.
I'm just thinking about my name mom.

328
00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:53.470
I can just imagine Hoenlein Casey.
My Dad though.

329
00:22:53.471 --> 00:22:58.390
Cause he's such a savage like I think that's why he likes like foreign checks

330
00:22:58.391 --> 00:23:01.410
cause American women will be like go fuck yourself.
Oh yeah,
no,

331
00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.810
they would not like I've heard him complained to his American girlfriend one

332
00:23:04.811 --> 00:23:09.640
time that he did have what?
He was like,
you know,
you working too much.

333
00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:14.000
Why don't you bring me a plate of Salami or a beer or something.

334
00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:18.970
I'm fucking hungry and all I to cook for me.
Clean up the house.
And she was like,

335
00:23:18.971 --> 00:23:19.670
what?

336
00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:23.620
Like American women had their heads explode when I dude says some crazy shit to

337
00:23:23.621 --> 00:23:24.370
them.

338
00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:29.370
But like Vietnam is probably like too your phone,

339
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:34.020
but she say sort of the ax.
Oh really?
You like more plan?

340
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:44.540
Do they only do nails and Vietnamese?
They don't do massage.
Right.

341
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:46.640
I don't know that.
That's

342
00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:47.700
<v 2>okay.</v>

343
00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.400
<v 4>Do you think he gets free Manny?
Petty's it's possible.</v>

344
00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:55.410
I don't know.
I Dunno.

345
00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:03.060
So yeah,
he's probably,
he's probably having a good time,
dude.

346
00:24:03.061 --> 00:24:06.060
You could have,
I mean,
if your dad had an interest in them,

347
00:24:06.061 --> 00:24:10.880
you could have had a Vietnam too.
Like you could have been oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

348
00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:15.260
You don't think he ever had some Vietnamese ladies during the war?
Uh,

349
00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:19.060
he said no and I didn't,
you know,
I mean,
it was like after,
he's like,
no,
I mean,

350
00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:23.250
he,
he said no and you know,
he would he be the kind to just come out and say,

351
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:29.000
I mean,
he told me all about who he fucked on a r and r one time.
Yeah.
Yeah.

352
00:24:29.001 --> 00:24:31.850
Like when they have like a break.
He's like,
yeah,
we went to Australia.

353
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:36.880
God start with the hottest chick in the room and the gods and then we just,

354
00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:38.451
God,

355
00:24:38.451 --> 00:24:43.430
we really enjoyed ourselves so grows her for a week and I'm like,

356
00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:44.283
all right,

357
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:49.370
well you were big tits full blush.
Oh yeah.

358
00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:53.400
He kept telling me,
I was like,
cool man.
Yeah.

359
00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:57.740
You kept talking about like you're getting the dog and I would so gross.

360
00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:01.310
You're talking about how my new mom makes my dad cause my dad is still,

361
00:25:01.311 --> 00:25:05.870
he's sexually active.
That's the thing.
It's like if he's 72 here's the thing,

362
00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:10.010
how that sweet Vietnamese lady,
it's not as easy as,
Hey,

363
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.420
I'm ready to do it.

364
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:16.490
She's got to go to work a to get that thing ready to perform and to make it

365
00:25:16.491 --> 00:25:17.324
finish.

366
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:21.700
It doesn't work the same way at 72 has 16 right.

367
00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:25.040
You know 16 you feel a breeze.
You're like,
oh,
okay.
Yeah,

368
00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:29.580
that's 72 she's got to put them,
she's go ahead,
put his legs back.

369
00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:33.110
Day changes died.
I like the scram.
Oh,

370
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:37.030
you got to spend 20 minutes there.
Then he's like,
oh,
it's up now.
Yeah.

371
00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:43.220
It's not just thinking about my dad's boners just bus inner and honor.

372
00:25:43.641 --> 00:25:46.790
And here's the deal man.
Like when I think about it,

373
00:25:46.791 --> 00:25:51.710
what he really wants is a housekeeper and a cook and you could buy one of those

374
00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:55.610
but then we kind of did,
well that's what I'm saying.
But the,

375
00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:59.870
the extra bonus is that he can bust nuts in his housekeeper.

376
00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:02.820
Like that's basically all this is like you,

377
00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:07.290
you probably could have just found some nice lady local,
right?

378
00:26:07.291 --> 00:26:09.550
Who Cook and clean for you.
Maybe legal buzz,

379
00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.570
Knutsen earn to maybe this is real love and we're being rude about it.

380
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.380
You don't know.
She's like 10 years younger than me dude.
Perfect.

381
00:26:19.381 --> 00:26:22.260
You didn't give him what you want to be able to 72 year old guy.
Absolutely.

382
00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.060
30 something.

383
00:26:24.061 --> 00:26:28.680
You're almost fucking on your 30 close your eyes and go back to being 30 Yup.

384
00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.990
Yup,
Yup.
Wasn't your perfect guy like seven

385
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:38.870
mm.
Let me think about it.
Nice.
40 year age gap,
right?

386
00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.890
Is
Skin all wrinkly and we know like,
oh,

387
00:26:43.891 --> 00:26:48.720
just a few more years and like get to have it.
Yep.
Ah,
it's so crazy.

388
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:53.490
She's probably thinking about her next marriage too.
Oh yeah.
Cause I definitely,

389
00:26:53.491 --> 00:26:55.140
I mean that,
that's gotta be the plan,
right?

390
00:26:55.141 --> 00:26:59.820
She's thinking how long do I have to ride this out?
I mean,
how many more years?

391
00:26:59.821 --> 00:27:02.500
Really?
Yeah.
And then she still will be,
you know,

392
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:05.490
relatively young and you should reach out.

393
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.690
Do you think our children need to know all this?
Sure.

394
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:11.190
They think they want to be a part of,

395
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:16.650
could you imagine having her over and acting like any of this is remotely
normal?

396
00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:22.000
Because that's the next,
that is the reach out.
Unfortunately,
if I were then,

397
00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:26.940
if she came over and she was like,
can I marry your son?
Oh,

398
00:27:26.941 --> 00:27:30.990
Ellis or Julian,
the promise like royalty,

399
00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:35.860
they turn 15 primary though.
Yeah.
She becomes a family sock puppet.
Oh my God.

400
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:40.980
The generational pig got me on that one.

401
00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:46.340
I wasn't expecting that.
I can't even imagine the,

402
00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:51.390
the bullshit I'd have to go through like pretending that this is remotely okay a

403
00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.760
lot.
They're like,
hi,
what's your name?
Like what's even,
what are their names?

404
00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:00.330
Like Vietnamese named tweet.
I don't tweet.
I don't even know.
Like what are real?

405
00:28:00.331 --> 00:28:01.530
Because they all at the nail salon,

406
00:28:01.531 --> 00:28:06.150
they always go by like Judy or you know Tracy though your name's not fucking

407
00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:09.240
Tracy.
A lot of a lot of people are lasting was dwin.

408
00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:15.300
That's the Smith of Vietnam,
right?
Yeah.
I'll be like,
hey,
hey Trey.

409
00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:18.660
Again,
I think she,
I mean you don't know.
She could be lovely.
No,
I know it's,

410
00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:22.800
she could be totally,
yeah,
it's absurd.
Like I,

411
00:28:22.801 --> 00:28:26.520
I just like nobody in my family is normal.
Like not one,
not one.

412
00:28:26.521 --> 00:28:30.910
The one that is normal moved away.
The one I liked and everybody damn it.

413
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:35.960
And I'm stuck with all these fucking crazy people,
man.
I know God damn it now.

414
00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:39.060
Or we're going to need to see that wedding video.
I got to go to my therapy.

415
00:28:39.061 --> 00:28:43.920
I got to go three times this week.
Got To triple up.
Yup.
Yeah.

416
00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.940

The picture is really what personally?
Yeah.

418

<v 6>I turned it to a telescope.</v>

419
00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.960
<v 4>I turned it into a telescope.
When you see my dad's wedding photo.
Yeah.</v>

420
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:04.150
I did fucking crazy.

Except oof.

Some else guys.
Yeah.
Um,
head's still spinning from that one.

422
00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:11.460
There was,
it was really something.

423
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.720
So he's got the Kimono on or whatever the fuck that shit is.

424
00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:19.530
No one thing that we're going to call that shit with sneakers.
Kimono.
Yeah.

425
00:29:19.531 --> 00:29:22.890
I'm like a fucking Vietnamese like wedding garb.
Yeah.
Come on.
Oh,

426
00:29:22.891 --> 00:29:25.290
Sharon on the fuck it's called and then she's wearing it and he's wearing his

427
00:29:25.291 --> 00:29:29.290
white ass sneakers too.
Like,
look,
cool.
You are,
you're good sneakers.
That's,
hey,

428
00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:33.150
that's what happens to older people though.
They don't give a fuck.
Yeah.
Yeah.

429
00:29:33.151 --> 00:29:37.280
It's always about foot comfort though.
That's how I am now.
I respect it.

430
00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:41.860
Like those shoes don't,
oh,
don't feel good.
Um,
I respect it.

431
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:46.240
<v 0>So,
oh,
Oscar's where a few weeks ago,</v>

432
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:52.500
the only thing we took a peek at was a who fucking Bradley Cooper and Lady Kaka

433
00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:00.010
Ma did a song together.
That's their,
their big hit song.
And they,

434
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:03.520
they looked at each other.
Yeah.
Just like they were in the movie,

435
00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:05.920
they had been performing the song a bit,
but,
uh,

436
00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.470
and they looked at each other with like,
I'm gonna fuck you eyes,

437
00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.070
right as they perform the song.

438
00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:16.510
Bradley Cooper's baby Momma's like in the front room now disrespect.
And it's,

439
00:30:16.511 --> 00:30:20.500
you know,
it's a performance,
but the way the these two,

440
00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:24.760
oh my God.
And they real hearing on like,
it's,

441
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:25.990
they get intense man.

442
00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.450
<v 4>I know.
Can I tell you something too?
Uh,</v>

443
00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:34.480
I would rather go to my dad's wedding with my new Vietnamese mom.

444
00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:39.680
Then watch them sing this song together.
It's uncarved see this movie.
Yeah.

445
00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:43.430
This whole fucking nonsense movie of them singing and stuff.

446
00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:45.110
I can't think of anything worse.

447
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:49.180
<v 0>Well,
they,
uh,
they really,
really love.</v>

448
00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:50.530
<v 4>All right.
I know.</v>

449
00:30:50.531 --> 00:30:55.330
And I tried watching the clip and I realized the movie that I hate slow songs.

450
00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.180
I hate slow songs too.
No,
I would never watch it.
That's what I'm saying.

451
00:30:58.181 --> 00:31:00.940
I would rather him fucking go to Vietnam and go to my dad's wedding,

452
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:04.240
then watch the fucking movie.
It's so terrible.

453
00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.670
<v 0>The,
uh,
what's it called?
The,
um,</v>

454
00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:10.700
that 90 day fiance.
Yeah.

455
00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:14.930
They do this thing where like whenever the couples do have like a loving moment,

456
00:31:14.931 --> 00:31:19.720
they start playing light.
Yeah.
I hate it.
Can feel your hate,

457
00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:20.900
that kind of music.

458
00:31:20.901 --> 00:31:24.770
And then like a guitar strums and it's like this little montage of them.
Yeah.

459
00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:25.933
I hate that.

460
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:29.260
<v 4>I hate it so much and I didn't realize how much I hated it until I tried</v>

461
00:31:29.261 --> 00:31:33.820
watching this clip that everybody was talking about between Lady Gaga,
lady cop,

462
00:31:33.821 --> 00:31:38.560
Bradley Cooper,
and I couldn't even get through the music.

463
00:31:38.561 --> 00:31:41.260
I'm like,
ugh.
I hate the emotion.
Yeah.

464
00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:44.950
I hate the only song I ever liked that was slow was the Whitney Houston the

465
00:31:44.951 --> 00:31:47.380
greatest love of all.
Yeah,
that was great.
Well,
I like,

466
00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:50.540
I like a lot of Whitney stuff.
No,
no tea.

467
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:51.250
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

468
00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:56.250
But because I don't like watching a lot of those kinds of performances.

469
00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:00.060
No,
I don't like watching that shit either.

470
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:04.320
And I don't like those songs.
I don't like,
yeah,
I don't like it.

471
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:09.060
I'll leave a restaurant or us a store.
Yeah.
It starts playing music.

472
00:32:09.061 --> 00:32:10.690
Like that means,
yeah.
Get the fuck out,

473
00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:17.730
<v 4>but uh,
but going back to your point of them being very intensely sexual.
Yeah.</v>

474
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:22.610
Uh,
if that was me in the audience and you are Bradley Cooper,
I'd find go rip.

475
00:32:22.611 --> 00:32:25.570
That bitch is necklace off.
Really Eddie,
I'm fucking choke her out with it.

476
00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.630
<v 0>Rip that stupid bar off her head.
Well,
deck.</v>

477
00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:33.700
That's a perfect lead in because it got me thinking about what about mean we

478
00:32:34.791 --> 00:32:39.050
work in this business?
What about me doing a love?

479
00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.100
No.
Would

480
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.410
<v 4>you just not ever watch it?
I would never watch it.</v>

481
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:49.600
I don't ever want to see you Matt kissing somebody else or making pretend.

482
00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:54.010
That's where we're different.
Kisses and licks.
Are you kidding me?
If you tell,

483
00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:57.830
if you had a love scene,
I would go in there with lube and I'd be like,

484
00:32:57.831 --> 00:33:02.000
let's see what's up and I would just get to and right away the cod.
Yeah.

485
00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:06.170
Are So nasty time if you're like,
no,
it's a train scene where it's like six guys.

486
00:33:06.171 --> 00:33:07.280
I'd be like,
even better.

487
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:13.430
I've just booked a small part in a movie.
I know.
Congratulations.
Yeah,

488
00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:17.870
shoots in a couple of months.
It's not romantic.
It's a very,
first of all,

489
00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:19.460
I didn't know this,

490
00:33:19.461 --> 00:33:24.320
but Hollywood sees me as a love men as a leading love man.

491
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:27.020
That's not true.
They,
they see me and they're like,

492
00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:30.890
this is who America wants to see,

493
00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:34.850
making love to women on camera.

494
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:40.370
And so it's a very romantic part.
Um,
it's called,
um,

495
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:43.970
I play this guy.
Uh,
I think it's Jake the hammer

496
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:50.210
and he just,
he hammers girls.
Really?
Okay.
What's the par for real?

497
00:33:50.211 --> 00:33:54.740
Can you say,
are you allowed to say?
Uh,
I can say that I'm a tech guy.
Yeah.

498
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.890
Are you an asshole in it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's your type.
Thank you.

499
00:33:57.891 --> 00:34:02.480
That's why I married you.
You're a lovable.
A whole.
Yeah,
but there's a love scene.

500
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:05.360
No,
there's not a shower.
Love saying stop it.

501
00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:08.900
The tech guy doesn't ever get a shower.
Lhotse.
Yes,
he does.
And this one.
Oh,

502
00:34:08.901 --> 00:34:12.800
stop it.
Yeah,
but we don't know.
So what'd you really don't watch it?
No,

503
00:34:12.801 --> 00:34:16.060
I couldn't be able to.
I wouldn't be able to.
Would you be able to watch me?

504
00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:18.590
I would watch it because I know you'd be like,
don't watch it

505
00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.700
because you'd be like,
do not watch it.
I'd be like,

506
00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:25.490
I want to go watch your feet feel.
Would you feel anything you think?

507
00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.440
What do you mean jealousy of what?

508
00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:33.830
Are you even listening to me?
Yeah,
never listen.

509
00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:34.753
I am listening.

510
00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:39.200
If I was Frenching Bradley Cooper and a movie and we were laughing and stuff.

511
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:41.510
Yeah,
you wouldn't feel any sort of way about it.

512
00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.760
Of course I would feel a certain way about it.
They'll be like,
oh,

513
00:34:43.761 --> 00:34:45.140
she doesn't usually French me like that.

514
00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:47.103
<v 7>Okay,</v>

515
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:52.640
<v 4>back man,
you've got so much tongue.
And if you're like,</v>

516
00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:57.630
and now I know,
put your legs behind your house.
There are well movie.
Nobody.

517
00:34:57.770 --> 00:35:01.880
No woman wants to do that to anybody who would do that to Bradley now.

518
00:35:01.881 --> 00:35:06.590
Not to Bradley Cooper.
I would do it to Ryan Gosling.
Gosling.
I would do it too.

519
00:35:06.591 --> 00:35:11.270
Um,
I like Jake John Hall.
Oh,
these are new new additions.

520
00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:13.343
<v 7>Okay.</v>

521
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:17.490
<v 4>We were,
we were going to book them around now or not.</v>

522
00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:23.160
You're happy now.
Oh,
spot.
You fucking stupid woman.
Dumb Bitch.

523
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:27.930
You stupid fucking bitch.
I like Jake Gyllenhaal.

524
00:35:27.931 --> 00:35:30.780
I like Ryan Gosling too.
I would put in,

525
00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:34.620
I would do the dog and she uses their scrum.
Jesus Christ.
See,

526
00:35:34.621 --> 00:35:38.520
I can see Gosling being like,
I don't,
I don't,
he's watching.
Yeah.
He'd be like,

527
00:35:38.521 --> 00:35:42.460
I don't want to do that to you.
But I could see Jillian hall just be like,

528
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:46.230
eat it and then hold your head back there and you're like,
Ooh,
I can't breathe.

529
00:35:46.231 --> 00:35:50.440
He's like,
shut up.
And then I don't think so.
I think he's really sweet.
None.

530
00:35:50.441 --> 00:35:54.170
And I think he's a really,
I don't think so.
I think he's a savage.

531
00:35:54.171 --> 00:35:57.710
I think he would step on your neck.
Put your head in the trash.
Yeah.

532
00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.300
And I gotta tell you I'm getting worked up thinking about it,

533
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:08.630
but I'm not a super jealous type anyway.
You're very mellow.

534
00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:12.320
But I also feel like you know,
you,
you make me feel that way.

535
00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:17.090
I make you feel safe.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I try.
Yeah.
I'm not thinking,

536
00:36:17.091 --> 00:36:18.800
I don't like to wind people up like that.

537
00:36:18.801 --> 00:36:21.510
I think that's cruel to play games with people.
Yeah.

538
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:24.700
I don't like that shit together like 15 years now.

539
00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:29.750
So you're saying you're going to stay married to me?
Uh,
for at least 2019.

540
00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:34.920
I'm never letting you divorced or never divorcing.
Yeah.

541
00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:39.940
I'm never going to let you.
Well I'm fucking so stupid.
Sled around my kids away.

542
00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:43.580
Just like you take your bank bus and you come back when you get this out of your

543
00:36:43.581 --> 00:36:47.780
system.
Ah,
nope.

544
00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:52.460
Oh Man.
No.
I'd be like,
guess what?
We're coming out with a bang butts with you.
Oh,

545
00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:57.110
bring the kids and my whole game.

Touched duty showed up a half hour late.

628
00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:08.290
Okay.
When there's no traffic,

Um,

629
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:13.190

640
00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:56.090
hour in this cool airport,
so I just want to thank you.
And he's like,

641
00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:00.560

642
00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:05.260
He got that.

I'm like,

645
00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:17.960

And he goes,

648
00:43:24.111 --> 00:43:28.850
I've been here for about 10 minutes and I go,
I told you to call me and I go,

649
00:43:28.851 --> 00:43:32.300
if I hadn't called you,
what would you have done?
And he goes,

650
00:43:32.301 --> 00:43:36.770
I would have kept waiting.
I'm like,
oh my God.

00:45:43.301 --> 00:45:46.640
but we're just going to fucking kill you as you are.
So Joe spreads his seat.

681
00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:50.780
It'd be terrible.
Um,
no.
So season two,

682
00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:51.950
congratulations on that.

683
00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:57.370
Congratulations on the miracle of getting a show on the air.
It is article.
Yeah.

684
00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:58.910
Yeah.
I mean I,
I just,

685
00:45:58.911 --> 00:46:03.500
another friend of mine just got greenlit to make a feature and I was like,
Whoa,

686
00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:08.630
it's amazing with that.
I've never heard.
Now of course we don't get to make it.

687
00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.400
Yeah.
It's weird.

688
00:46:10.401 --> 00:46:14.180
Like so many people we know have made livings for 20 years by selling things

689
00:46:14.181 --> 00:46:15.590
that they know will never get made.

690
00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.890
I'm just going to write it in my room and our,
I can write it from anywhere.

691
00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:22.250
It's weird to make a cooler that way.
You actually did it.
We did it.

692
00:46:22.251 --> 00:46:26.270
I almost feel like it's this weird thing where because we got to make it so,

693
00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:29.660
so early into our careers or like within like the first decade,

694
00:46:29.661 --> 00:46:31.310
it's like we're never going to get to do it again.

695
00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:33.680
Like it's just setting us up to be like,
no,
this was just your chain.

696
00:46:33.681 --> 00:46:35.860
Are you enjoying it?
Are you having fun doing?
It's great.

697
00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:41.580
It's beyond a dream cause you get to like write and direct and cast and produce

698
00:46:41.751 --> 00:46:44.030
it.
It's like why are you letting us do that?

699
00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.290
Like it doesn't really make any sense.

700
00:46:45.291 --> 00:46:48.080
It was like a giant playground that costs a ton of money and we,

701
00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:52.220
and we're responsible to make sure that money is used well done that thing yet

702
00:46:52.221 --> 00:46:54.440
where you go like what?
What if we did this?

703
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:57.650
And then they go like that would be like 50,000 just for that shot.

704
00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:00.190
And you're like,
yes we have.
Yeah we have.

705
00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:04.520
What's interesting when you like write and make the show is like when you're

706
00:47:04.521 --> 00:47:05.240
writing a show you're like,

707
00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:09.110
oh it'd be so funny if we like went to the desert and blah blah blah and then

708
00:47:09.111 --> 00:47:11.210
like cut to three months later we got to go to the fucking,

709
00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:15.880
does it have like a weird combo buys find that a lot.
Yeah.
With like Matt,

710
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:19.120
there's a lot in the show of Matt just getting hit and so,

711
00:47:19.121 --> 00:47:22.390
and we don't realize you're going to have to get hit like 30 times if you write

712
00:47:22.391 --> 00:47:26.080
it in with all the different angles.
And you have to be like it's going to be,

713
00:47:26.081 --> 00:47:27.850
or if you write that you're going to be in your underwear,

714
00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:30.640
like you're going to be in your fucking underwear,
that'd be naked.

715
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:33.220
You don't think about it cause you have to just do the funniest possible thing.

716
00:47:33.221 --> 00:47:36.100
But it is kind of an angry God.
We have perfect bodies and look right in there.

717
00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:42.030
Now did you guys come from a sketch background?
Yeah,
well we did.

718
00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:42.630
It was sad.

719
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:46.390
It was sketch because we were doing standup for like a decade or whatever in La

720
00:47:46.391 --> 00:47:49.480
and just try and do as much as possible and then we were simultaneously doing

721
00:47:49.481 --> 00:47:51.370
videos sketch so it wasn't like live sketch.

722
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:55.160
It was like making short films just like yes,
this almost no way around it.
Yes,

723
00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:58.570
it's honestly I reckon it's kind of what you almost have to do now.

724
00:47:58.571 --> 00:48:00.550
Like you guys,
I don't know if you make videos,
sketches,

725
00:48:00.551 --> 00:48:04.690
but you do a lot of standup but I think most people coming out now pretty much

726
00:48:04.691 --> 00:48:07.680
have to do both.
Like it's what a comedian is,

727
00:48:07.681 --> 00:48:10.870
is way different than it was 20 years ago.
I think,

728
00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:15.760
and you have to kind of know how to write direct edit,
like caste act,

729
00:48:15.761 --> 00:48:19.350
all that stuff,
just to get a chance to make your own thing,
you know,

730
00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:23.740
just so you can just stand up and came from that school doing those youtube

731
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:26.410
because it used to be like,

732
00:48:26.411 --> 00:48:30.370
it used to almost be like you did stand up so he could get a show and now it's

733
00:48:30.371 --> 00:48:35.130
almost like you make many shows online so you can go tour,
stand up and it's,

734
00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:37.970
it's weird and it's,
it's just changing all the time.
Yeah.

735
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:40.000
Well luckily you guys are doing great,
like you did it,

736
00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:42.560
but it's kind of our sketch show in a way.
Right.
You know,

737
00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:44.320
you need this in order for people to come see you.

738
00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:47.890
It's a totally different kind of thing.
It feeds itself.
It's a weird,

739
00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:50.890
it's weird being a comedian.
Yeah,
it's very,
it's great

740
00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:55.510
you guys saying this because somebody's listening.

741
00:48:55.511 --> 00:48:58.990
Like I just worked with a fifth year of comic and she was like,

742
00:48:58.991 --> 00:49:01.750
my parents don't support me and my decision,
I'm like,
first of all,

743
00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:04.520
don't ever expect support from fucking any.
They should you,

744
00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:07.840
it's a stupid thing to do with your life,
you're probably not going to make it.

745
00:49:07.841 --> 00:49:10.810
Yeah.
And secondly,
I was like,

746
00:49:10.811 --> 00:49:13.630
you don't think at some point I was a five year comic and I was sitting in your

747
00:49:13.631 --> 00:49:16.690
exact shoes and somebody watching you guys today,
they're like,

748
00:49:16.691 --> 00:49:20.640
I could never make a TV show.
And you know what's funny is that there's,

749
00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:24.640
there's this huge myth that things can't get made,
but you know,

750
00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:28.300
networks need you more than you need them.
They need you.

751
00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:31.300
We go in a lot of meetings and they're like,
we need something good.

752
00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:34.300
Please just give us something good.
Like we're just desk.

753
00:49:34.301 --> 00:49:38.250
Please just say the thing.
So we can say yes.
And if you just,

754
00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:41.710
I would say one of the most important things right now is learn how to edit,

755
00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:44.170
learn how to just even shoot and edit.

756
00:49:44.171 --> 00:49:47.620
And if you and make things all the time and it takes a few years to get really

757
00:49:47.621 --> 00:49:50.110
good and you're so,
you're going to be so happy you learned how to do it,

758
00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:53.350
do it before you're too old to be annoyed at doing it.

759
00:49:53.351 --> 00:49:55.000
And then learn how to do it and make stuff.

760
00:49:55.001 --> 00:49:57.100
You really never know what can happen.
That being said,

761
00:49:57.101 --> 00:50:00.790
I do my stock advice for people who are like,
should I get into this?
It's like,

762
00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:05.620
no,
because if they,
if I talk them out of it good,

763
00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:08.920
then they'd be like,
have a shot at a normal life.
Right?
Yeah.
But if they're like,

764
00:50:08.921 --> 00:50:11.260
fuck you,
I'm gonna do it anyway,
then I've like inspired them.

765
00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:15.070
And actually the only the people who go like,
Nah,

766
00:50:15.071 --> 00:50:17.860
I'm fucking doing it or should be the ones that,
yeah,
that's exactly right.

767
00:50:17.861 --> 00:50:20.300
So she would always say,
don't get into this.
Yeah,
of course.

768
00:50:20.301 --> 00:50:22.990
Because the people always like,
I get hit up,
they're like,
uh,
you know,

769
00:50:22.991 --> 00:50:26.260
I gotta I got like a,
like I have like an hour of material and I'm like,
yeah,

770
00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:31.160
like,
but I haven't done it yet.
And I'm like,
yeah,
okay.
And then they're like,

771
00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:33.860
I just haven't,
you know,
what should I do now?
I'm like,
I don't know,
man.
Like,

772
00:50:33.861 --> 00:50:37.880
go do your hour and,
and then,
you know,
the,
I mean,

773
00:50:37.881 --> 00:50:40.760
the answer's always the same.
Two was just like,
well,
just get on stage.

774
00:50:40.761 --> 00:50:43.770
They're like,
where?
I'm like,
I don't know.
You figure it out,
figure it out.

775
00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:46.130
It's almost like,
it's very interesting.

776
00:50:46.131 --> 00:50:49.910
It's like it really is the type of person that does it is not someone who asks

777
00:50:49.911 --> 00:50:50.744
too many questions.

778
00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:54.130
Maybe you ask a few questions because it is a little scary at first.
Sure.

779
00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:57.620
You get five questions and it's like,
go figure it out.
We all figured it out.

780
00:50:57.830 --> 00:50:59.290
No one really has any answers.

781
00:50:59.330 --> 00:51:02.750
They actually almost because someone has done it a certain way,

782
00:51:02.751 --> 00:51:04.430
it almost means you have to do it a different way.

783
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:09.090
You almost just have to go into a blackout for five years,
um,

784
00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:11.940
and then pop out and hope you've learned a few things.
Sometimes I've,

785
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.790
I feel like,
uh,
like some of the things that feel like a long time ago,

786
00:51:16.791 --> 00:51:19.620
I'll stop.
You're like,
shit,
that was only like five years ago.
Yeah,
I know.

787
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:23.370
It feels like it was,
I'm talking about like my teenage years or something.
Yeah.

788
00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:27.830
It's not that long ago.
Right.
You were 12,
five years ago.
[inaudible]

789
00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:30.650
legal for you to have two kids.

790
00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:35.780
I know it makes this personality that we all have to be in this business and

791
00:51:35.781 --> 00:51:40.040
persist even though you're told no constantly and on this thing about not asking

792
00:51:40.041 --> 00:51:42.870
questions like I was a latch key kids,

793
00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:47.220
there was nobody to ask fucking figure it out.
Right?

794
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:51.980
You have to be so resilient and self sufficient.
You have to be a maniac,

795
00:51:52.110 --> 00:51:55.390
got to live in poverty,
live core.

796
00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:58.120
You have a terrible life.

797
00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:00.770
You have to be uncomfortable to want to fight your way out of it.

798
00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:04.940
Now what happens sometimes is some people then just do heroin instead.

799
00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:08.710
If you don't do heroin,
you'll eventually make it up.
That's true.

800
00:52:09.090 --> 00:52:13.700
So you were saying you're considering antidepressants because I mean I feel like

801
00:52:13.701 --> 00:52:17.900
a large part of why I've been able to like make a living at least for the past

802
00:52:17.901 --> 00:52:22.600
four or five years,
finally is like a comedian is because I was so unhappy.
Like,

803
00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:26.720
I just feel like I'm so unhappy and I think the world is so bad and I want so

804
00:52:26.721 --> 00:52:29.780
badly to have a good time,
so I'm miserable.
And I'm like,
well,

805
00:52:29.781 --> 00:52:33.950
if I just go do five open mics tonight and then make a sketch to and don't sleep

806
00:52:33.951 --> 00:52:37.280
and drink coffee and a mad,
then eventually I can fight my way out.

807
00:52:37.281 --> 00:52:40.670
But now I haven't fought my way out.
I'm just making a good living right now.

808
00:52:40.671 --> 00:52:44.330
And I'm like,
Oh,
I'm still unhappy.
The problem is me.
So I feel like I just,

809
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:47.850
but it's like,
I think there's a large part of,
if you're a comedian,
you,

810
00:52:47.851 --> 00:52:50.840
you see things in a critical way a lot of times.

811
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:54.260
And I'm not just purely silly on stage or like purely selling what I'm saying.

812
00:52:54.261 --> 00:52:56.660
So it's like I see things critically and um,

813
00:52:56.750 --> 00:53:01.400
you sort of get trapped into thinking that,
well,
that's your income,

814
00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:03.800
so you don't want to fuck with that.
You know what I mean?
I want to,

815
00:53:03.801 --> 00:53:06.800
I want to look at things the same way.
So it's consistent,
but it's like,
but I'm,

816
00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:09.920
but I'm not happy when it goes well.
Like when it goes well,
I'm like,
well,

817
00:53:09.921 --> 00:53:12.050
whatever,
it doesn't matter.
I trick them,
you know?
So I just,

818
00:53:12.051 --> 00:53:16.310
I just want to enjoy stuff.
You're so messed up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm super fucked up

819
00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:22.970
because here's the deal.
You'll get even successfully going up.
Yeah.
You get,

820
00:53:22.971 --> 00:53:27.000
you get your everything you wanted and then you still are a piece of shit on the

821
00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:30.570
inside.
You still feel it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Have,
you know you're a fraud.
So it's like,

822
00:53:30.571 --> 00:53:33.660
yeah,
you're just like,
oh dark.
So I would love to,

823
00:53:33.661 --> 00:53:37.080
I would love to just be able to eat food,
enjoy it and be like,
wow,

824
00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:41.790
my night was made.
Wow.
Good food.
Good,
delicious.

825
00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:44.850
Someone said they loved me and it was nice.
The funniest thing.

826
00:53:44.851 --> 00:53:47.430
I've experienced what you guys have experienced it.
I think another level of,

827
00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:48.600
it's like doing a show.

828
00:53:48.601 --> 00:53:51.120
I've done a couple shows in front of like thousands of people.

829
00:53:51.121 --> 00:53:56.040
I like that moment is so wild.
It's such a rush.
But then cut to one hour later,

830
00:53:56.041 --> 00:54:00.280
I'm like,
I'm pissing in a toilet alone.
You know what I mean?
Was like,
what?

831
00:54:00.281 --> 00:54:05.040
What's that?
You know it's a bizarre.
Is that all there is?
That's the,

832
00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:09.650
you know that song,
is that all there is?
Is that all there is my friends.

833
00:54:09.651 --> 00:54:14.150
So let's keep dancing.
Is that all there is?
You make it?
Yes.

834
00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:19.310
You still feel fucking empty and your parents don't like you and you know it's,

835
00:54:19.810 --> 00:54:22.080
it's why you get into therapy or your parents like me.

836
00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:25.100
I told you that your friends aren't love ages.

837
00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:31.410
I'm great with thirds by charter parents.

838
00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:36.390
I love meeting my girlfriend's parents.
Really?
Why?
Cause I'm fucking charming.

839
00:54:37.770 --> 00:54:42.240
Tall,
white,
solid looking man.
It's like you have good job.
Yeah.

840
00:54:42.241 --> 00:54:45.540
Like hi,
I'm a competent man.
Nice to meet you.
Yeah,

841
00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:52.400
I'm on TV.
Yeah.
Oh Wow.
Okay.
Yeah.
Really Nice job with this one.

842
00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:56.640
So that'd be a big man.
Are you in therapy though?

843
00:54:57.510 --> 00:55:00.770
I'm going back in.
You got to get those meds too,
man.

844
00:55:00.810 --> 00:55:04.230
I'm going to get those meds because I feel like I've had enough comedian friends

845
00:55:04.231 --> 00:55:07.380
who are like,
no,
you don't understand dude.
I feel pretty good right now.

846
00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:11.670
And I'm like,
I've seen it.
Definitely changed a couple of,
yeah,
it'd be nice.

847
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:15.570
There's no reason for the side effects,
whatever they're going to be,

848
00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:19.530
whether it's like I gained like a hundred pounds or I can't fuck anymore.

849
00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:23.970
Or I start sweating whenever the TV changes a channel,
whatever it is.

850
00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:28.600
I'm excited for that.
Yeah,
exactly.
You just transfer it.
Season three,

851
00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:30.871
season three.

852
00:55:30.871 --> 00:55:33.900
It's like maybe I'll go on antidepressants then do an episode about that and

853
00:55:33.901 --> 00:55:38.320
it'll pay for itself.
There you go.
Perfect.
Yeah.

854
00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:42.940
Yeah.
I'm glad you said something right before they got here.

855
00:55:42.941 --> 00:55:47.210
We were right before the guy,
we were talking about your,
your dad.
Oh my fuck.

856
00:55:47.211 --> 00:55:51.470
So my dad,
I'll just tell her how we found the picture I was on,
I was on,
uh,

857
00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.580
social media,
uh,

858
00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:57.900
relative posted a wedding picture of my dad in Vietnam,

859
00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:02.610
uh,
with his new wife,
the full Vietnamese Regalia,

860
00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:06.510
like the wedding regalia,
but he's still wearing white sneakers,
which is nice.

861
00:56:07.810 --> 00:56:09.060
This is how you found out.

862
00:56:09.810 --> 00:56:13.170
I knew that they were engaged like a while back and they think they probably got

863
00:56:13.171 --> 00:56:17.700
married here,
but I think this is the foreign ceremony also,

864
00:56:17.701 --> 00:56:20.960
like 10 years younger than me.
Mommy,

865
00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:29.710
tiny little model.
Um,
so yeah,
it's fucking,

866
00:56:29.711 --> 00:56:32.070
my parents are garbage.
They're just cramps.

867
00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:35.230
So irresponsible.
Yeah.

868
00:56:35.231 --> 00:56:38.740
My Dad's been married and divorced three times and still has no idea that he is

869
00:56:38.741 --> 00:56:40.900
the problem.
You know what I mean?
Like has no idea.
He's like,
yeah,

870
00:56:40.901 --> 00:56:44.770
women are just annoying.
I mean,
dude,
it's clearly you

871
00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:52.640
like three times,
like,
and you're like,
yeah,
he,
um,
it's amazing,
isn't it?
He,

872
00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:55.420
he was dating a woman who,
um,

873
00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:59.230
who didn't want to sleep with them,
but he proposed to her.

874
00:56:59.231 --> 00:57:03.130
So she would essentially be as nurse and it was like,
it was like for her,

875
00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.770
this would have been his fourth wife.
And she's like,
no,

876
00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:07.840
what are you talking about?
I don't want to,

877
00:57:07.841 --> 00:57:10.390
I don't want to fucking be here and I'll just be your friend.
Leave me alone.

878
00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:13.510
I know what my dad's doing.
It's,

879
00:57:13.511 --> 00:57:18.470
I want you to cook and clean and be able to fuck you.
Yeah.
Cool.

880
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:21.820
Good arrangement.
I tell you what's scary though.
My Dad is 85.

881
00:57:21.821 --> 00:57:26.640
I have an old dad and I have two older sisters who were in their sixties yeah,

882
00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:30.190
it's crazy.
So I was the third marriage and I was the only boy.
So he,
he's the,

883
00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:33.330
he tells me all these old sperm,
yeah,
I'm old school.

884
00:57:33.331 --> 00:57:36.460
I'm so imagine what I could have been from what I could have been,

885
00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:38.530
I could have been a serial killer.
You know what I mean?

886
00:57:38.531 --> 00:57:40.650
I could have had that kind of energy.
I would have been happy,

887
00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:45.680
but I'm just no empathy.
I would have been so happy.
Serial killers.

888
00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:52.690
Pretty cool.
[inaudible] got a bad rap on this last shot.

889
00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:57.640
You know?
What did he do wrong?
So he's really,
yeah,

890
00:57:57.830 --> 00:58:01.080
he really so good at it really bums me out though.

891
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:04.990
We're never going to see anyone like that again because of forensics and DNA.

892
00:58:04.991 --> 00:58:08.290
Now we're going to put up bodies like maybe Garth Brooks,
but

893
00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:16.480
Garth got bodies for sure.
I Chris Gaines,
alter ego.
It was just a,

894
00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:19.990
just a fucking straight up murder,
like the dark hair.

895
00:58:19.991 --> 00:58:22.990
It's like stopping Moody fucking that countryside.

896
00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:26.050
Here's how they're going to do either you have to be a high profile celebrity,

897
00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:30.160
like a Garth Brooks or like r Kelly.

898
00:58:30.161 --> 00:58:32.770
He got away with shit for a long time.

899
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:37.890
That was a weird bond.
After three days in jail and you're like,
what?

900
00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:40.170
You know what's weird?
You know what's weird about that?

901
00:58:41.010 --> 00:58:43.090
What I truly don't relate to with people like that,

902
00:58:43.091 --> 00:58:47.620
it's like he's been doing bad stuff for so long.
He doesn't,

903
00:58:47.621 --> 00:58:52.130
he doesn't seem to be stressed about who are our Kelly.

904
00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:56.800
That's amazing.
Right now.

905
00:58:56.801 --> 00:59:00.400
What I'm actually thinking about is something I said to someone at a party two

906
00:59:00.401 --> 00:59:03.490
years ago.
You know what I mean and I'm stressed out about it.
I'm like,
I fuck up,

907
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:06.640
but he just is like,
no,
I'm just going to do horrible things.

908
00:59:06.641 --> 00:59:08.110
I'm not going to worry about,
it's fine.

909
00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:11.320
I'm going to hope for a new space jam and write that soundtrack too.

910
00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:15.150
He and it's like,
wow,
how do you not stress about shit?
They'd Cosby,
same thing.

911
00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:17.930
He'd come out of court doing impressions,

912
00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:23.780
walked out of court.
We get locked out of the court.
When he got convicted,

913
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:27.410
it's not like so there are walk out of court,
you've been convicted,

914
00:59:27.411 --> 00:59:32.220
you're going to be sending,
and he goes like,
oh.
They're like,
hey,

915
00:59:34.090 --> 00:59:37.370
and they're like,
dude,
I feel like we did right now

916
00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:43.020
we need to figure out more specific punishments for these people because

917
00:59:45.990 --> 00:59:48.690
even when he was walking out,
he was like,
I'm not going to bill Cosby.

918
00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:51.610
I'm not going to jail Kelly tape.

919
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:55.730
I shouldn't have to repent for any crimes.

920
00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:02.160
I'm so fixated on the fact that he has sold definitely over 30 million albums

921
01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:08.930
and he definitely has toward for 25 years.

922
01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:10.880
So many hits thing.
I mean,

923
01:00:10.881 --> 01:00:14.600
just like so much income generated and they're like,

924
01:00:14.601 --> 01:00:17.730
post $100,000 bond to get out of jail.
He's like,
I don't have it.
I know.

925
01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:23.750
Just like being like,
I'll,
it'll get figured out.
It's so stressful.

926
01:00:23.751 --> 01:00:28.430
I'm so stressed.
I just,
I just went over my taxes.
I just went over my taxes,

927
01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:31.430
which are just fine,
not a ton of money.
And I was like,
I'm going to jail.

928
01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:33.350
You know what I mean?
Like I'm reporting it accurately,

929
01:00:33.351 --> 01:00:36.150
but I'm gonna miss one thing and I'm gonna go to jail.
And he's just like,
no,

930
01:00:36.151 --> 01:00:38.000
I'm going to do horrible things for two decades.

931
01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.430
Women in a dungeon in my house in Atlanta.

932
01:00:40.610 --> 01:00:43.300
That's the other thing I don't relate to.
Those are,
those are right.

933
01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.960
You can write those off actually.
So that's the other,

934
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:51.590
oh my God,
they're just so like,
they have so much energy to keep being bad,

935
01:00:51.790 --> 01:00:55.990
you know,
not even tired.
50 and he's not tired.
Yeah.

936
01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:57.380
That's exactly right.

937
01:00:57.381 --> 01:01:02.360
That's how we feel about people that have these pro click sexual proclivities

938
01:01:02.361 --> 01:01:04.730
that are very involved.
Like people that are in to

939
01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:11.270
jerk off and go to sleep,
man.
But you got to buy shit.
Meet other people and room.

940
01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:14.870
Exactly.
You gotta be there Saturday at one like that.

941
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:21.120
You have to buy a harness.

942
01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:26.550
What if I take antidepressants and all the sudden I only can come off being fuck

943
01:01:26.551 --> 01:01:30.740
while wearing a diaper.
I'm really worried.

944
01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.840
One of my friends is happier than ever and he's like,

945
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:36.260
but I have zero sensitivity.
Yeah.
And he's like,

946
01:01:36.261 --> 01:01:40.030
I cannot feel anything on my d.
Like it's just,
that's what I've heard top.
Yeah.

947
01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:40.970
But I guess he doesn't care

948
01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:48.170
being depressed and he fucks I fuck.
But I don't think I do it well anymore.

949
01:01:48.730 --> 01:01:50.020
I don't really care how it ends.

950
01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:58.510
It'll be bad for my girl for sex is like a movie without a third act falls apart

951
01:01:58.511 --> 01:02:02.540
at the great.
So wait,
do you have trouble finishing though?
Yes,

952
01:02:02.541 --> 01:02:04.430
but that's also because you can actually,
I can,

953
01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:06.980
this is kind of a fucked up story,
but I might as well talk about it.

954
01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:10.620
The real reason I have fucked up,
uh,
I have trouble fidget,

955
01:02:10.650 --> 01:02:14.000
which you already know about was,
and this is a bad story.
Um,

956
01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:17.020
but in college I,

957
01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.950
this is real and I'm not saying women this overall,

958
01:02:19.951 --> 01:02:24.930
I'm just saying this happened to me.
I went to school in the south,
um,

959
01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:27.120
and I in Nashville,

960
01:02:27.121 --> 01:02:31.580
Tennessee and went to school at Vanderbilt and I should the brain,
Jesus,

961
01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:36.580
thank you.
Look at our biggest headache.
Well,
they let use the intelligence,
um,

962
01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:39.300
English major.
But Anyway,
um,

963
01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:42.420
I d I would date Christian women for the first time cause I was like that lively

964
01:02:42.421 --> 01:02:45.520
Jew that they could,
you know,
it's like the college experience was dating a Jew,

965
01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:50.310
but it was a little dangerous.
I actually have a cat named Shiksa.
Um,
but anyway,

966
01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:53.280
uh,
fucking gay boys.
I loved it.
I mean,
it was,
I mean,

967
01:02:53.281 --> 01:02:57.750
it really is like a Jewish dream because it,
because,
and this is horrible,

968
01:02:57.751 --> 01:03:00.570
but it just sort of feels like you're like,

969
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:04.290
they're going against Christ to fuck you.
Like that's such a compliment.

970
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:08.190
They're risking.
Yeah.
But I mean,
they don't think about that.

971
01:03:08.191 --> 01:03:09.580
You know what I mean?
And it's,
um,

972
01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:13.500
it just feels like they're making they're sinning and it's like a huge

973
01:03:13.501 --> 01:03:14.334
compliment.
But anyway,

974
01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:18.330
I dated someone who was very like very Christian and it was very interesting at

975
01:03:18.331 --> 01:03:21.210
first,
very opposites attract.
But then I,

976
01:03:21.570 --> 01:03:25.500
I caught her cheating on me with a guy who wore a hemp necklace of the pope to

977
01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:29.490
his job at Starbucks.
So,
so while we were,

978
01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:33.030
it was so specific and he thought the world was going to end.
It was crazy.

979
01:03:33.031 --> 01:03:34.860
He was crazy.
But anyway,
it caught them.

980
01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:39.060
I accidentally saw an email that confirmed it,
but it was,
and she admitted to it.

981
01:03:39.061 --> 01:03:41.160
But what was interesting was then we,

982
01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:45.150
I like that I would like take Valium and get blackout drunk because I was so,

983
01:03:45.151 --> 01:03:46.800
it was the first time we've ever been cheated on.
It's a hard,

984
01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:50.000
it's hard when you're like,
oh the world is bad,
that's bad.
Um,

985
01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:53.490
before you even understand sex,
confusing,
whatever.
But at that point I was like,

986
01:03:53.491 --> 01:03:58.290
my world was shattered and we,
we,
she then went off birth control,

987
01:03:58.350 --> 01:04:01.530
snuck into my room,
woke me up,
we had sex one night,

988
01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:03.660
which is essentially a version of assault,

989
01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:07.230
but she also had gotten up birth control to try and get pregnant.

990
01:04:07.231 --> 01:04:11.070
And then for several weeks,
um,
this is actually helpful for me.
I'm sorry.

991
01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:14.200
Sorry man.
But for several weeks she was like,
I think I'm pregnant.

992
01:04:14.201 --> 01:04:17.000
I think I'm pregnant.
Should try to keep me.
Oh my God.

993
01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.860
Cause she wanted to keep me and then she wasn't pregnant and I never,

994
01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:23.940
and so it was then,
but I have not been able to finish during sex since then.

995
01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:29.010
Sit Horse College,
except very few times in my life.
But it's been a nightmare.

996
01:04:29.011 --> 01:04:31.890
So it is a little tragic.
And it's been about 15 years,

997
01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:35.310
but at least I don't have any kids.
I don't want yet.
You got to talk to him.

998
01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:39.810
Literally.
You got to talk to Josh.
He works here.
Uh,

999
01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:44.070
comic.
Hilarious dude.
And uh,
he can't finish.

1000
01:04:44.110 --> 01:04:47.690
It's hard man.
It's a lot of work.
It sounds like yours is trauma related is

1001
01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.760
that you can work out with a shrink.

1002
01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:55.290
I think I need to go to one of those sex therapists like Helen Hunt played,

1003
01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.290
you know,
when they like have sex with you.
And they were like,

1004
01:04:57.300 --> 01:05:00.720
now like obviously your girlfriend would know this story,
right?

1005
01:05:00.721 --> 01:05:04.010
You told me the story.
I've told her and then she tried.

1006
01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:08.010
Did she try then we'll never have sex with that girl.
Crazy.

1007
01:05:08.011 --> 01:05:10.700
Does she try though to be like,
let's,
let's try to make a hat.

1008
01:05:10.810 --> 01:05:12.030
Many girlfriends have tried.

1009
01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:14.850
It's just a very frustrating thing cause you're like,
you just,

1010
01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:18.030
you feel a little humiliated,
you know,
but not like,
you

1011
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.320
<v 11>also don't want your girlfriend to think it's her fault.
Yeah.
You do.
Yeah.</v>

1012
01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:26.980
If you were hotter,
well,

1013
01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:31.150
<v 10>weird sort of thing where it's like it's kind of,
yeah,</v>

1014
01:05:31.151 --> 01:05:35.320
it's just confusing and I don't exactly know what to do.
Like I don't even,

1015
01:05:35.321 --> 01:05:38.950
I don't even really know how to deal with it cause it's like I've slept with so

1016
01:05:38.951 --> 01:05:42.490
many people like it because also when you go through sexual trauma,

1017
01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:43.570
you can go different ways.

1018
01:05:43.571 --> 01:05:47.260
You could either never have sex or you could have sex with everyone and this

1019
01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:50.620
associate any feelings from it.
So I've kinda gotten that path in my life.
I mean,

1020
01:05:50.621 --> 01:05:53.140
I've also had girlfriends,
but like,
just lost my mind with it.

1021
01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:56.270
But it doesn't really,
it's all just to avoid feeling.
So yeah,

1022
01:05:56.570 --> 01:05:58.990
<v 11>I have,
it's really fascinating.
I have the opposite problem.</v>

1023
01:05:58.991 --> 01:06:02.640
My Dick is always rock hard and I can't stop coming.
I'm coming right now.

1024
01:06:02.641 --> 01:06:03.540
I've got a diaper on

1025
01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:09.530
<v 7>one of our daughters is a problem.
I just said,</v>

1026
01:06:10.530 --> 01:06:13.770
does he want to chime in on it?
I don't know.
Does he want to show us his dick?

1027
01:06:13.810 --> 01:06:14.710
I mean,
I'd love to show us

1028
01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:17.700
<v 11>Josh,
Josh,
Josh,
you think you could,
uh,</v>

1029
01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:22.780
maybe Josh relate to what's going on here,
man.

1030
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:24.100
She was bleeding a little bit more.

1031
01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:31.460
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

1032
01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:36.000
<v 11>oh man.
I mean it's,
it,
does it feel good though to hear a,</v>

1033
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:40.140
uh,
you know,
like do you have a brother is here?
Yeah.
And you nailed it too.

1034
01:06:40.141 --> 01:06:44.700
Like how you can either just fuck nothing for awhile and that's no good.

1035
01:06:44.701 --> 01:06:48.990
Or you can just fuck everything and then that's pretty cool.
But it's like,

1036
01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:52.950
it's not though.
It's not your right if you become dead behind the eyes.

1037
01:06:53.370 --> 01:06:55.260
It's just a,
it's like,
what am I doing?

1038
01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:58.350
You end up in just so many places where you're like,
why am I here?

1039
01:06:58.351 --> 01:07:00.790
Like this is dangerous.
I shouldn't be in this.

1040
01:07:00.791 --> 01:07:04.990
I think we may have done something pretty unhealthy.
What's the over Josh?
No,
no,

1041
01:07:04.991 --> 01:07:09.050
no,
no.
Don't call out there.
She was like,
I dare you to make Josh

1042
01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:15.610
<v 7>and there,
there's some women with blonde that's a limited series.
Netflix,</v>

1043
01:07:15.611 --> 01:07:18.860
you can sell Jerry to make judge cut.

1044
01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:23.230
<v 11>We are a,
we are constantly adding cities to the,
Make Josh come to her</v>

1045
01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:27.910
20,
20,
20.
Hopefully.
So,
I mean,
I wonder if there's any,

1046
01:07:27.911 --> 01:07:30.220
I mean you guys obviously should be in a support group together,

1047
01:07:30.221 --> 01:07:33.970
but I wonder if there's any,
um,
like anything that they could,
uh,

1048
01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:37.680
may I ask a question that maybe you relate these,
uh,

1049
01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:41.790
when you are in the act of sex,
do you ever just find your,

1050
01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:46.480
call it the act of sex?
I just figured out your problem.
I guess that's true,

1051
01:07:47.590 --> 01:07:51.230
but do you ever just,
are you ever just not even there?
You know what I mean?
Like,

1052
01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:52.860
<v 10>well,
yeah,
I mean,
of course,</v>

1053
01:07:52.861 --> 01:07:56.610
because part of the problem is if you're so worried about coming because you're

1054
01:07:56.611 --> 01:08:00.360
afraid what it'll lead to.
Cause it's not just the leading to a baby,

1055
01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:02.820
even if the person's on birth control,
it's a little irrational.

1056
01:08:02.821 --> 01:08:04.500
You know what I mean?
Like even if like I have an Iud,

1057
01:08:04.501 --> 01:08:07.290
it's still a little rational.
It's the loss of control.

1058
01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:12.240
So I feel like you can't really get lost in sex because you're just worried

1059
01:08:12.241 --> 01:08:13.950
about what might happen.
So you can't,

1060
01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:18.350
you're not really feeling like the fact that you're in a magnificent vagina,

1061
01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:22.250
like it's an amazing,
let you do this.
This is the best,
this is the best thing.

1062
01:08:22.251 --> 01:08:23.600
Life can really effect element.

1063
01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:28.040
So it is and so and so it's a little Shim because you can't relax because you're

1064
01:08:28.041 --> 01:08:31.940
worried something bad's going to happen.
It's complicated.
It's really,

1065
01:08:32.530 --> 01:08:36.710
it's a shame.
So Josh,
having listened to this,

1066
01:08:36.711 --> 01:08:39.970
do you think that maybe your problem might be trauma related?
Like to,

1067
01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:41.510
can you think back to an incident?

1068
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:46.400
I can't think of one that would be a trauma instance,

1069
01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:48.170
but I do know what you're saying.
Like,

1070
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:52.730
and then there's also like say it's not a magnificent vagina and you get in

1071
01:08:52.731 --> 01:08:57.530
there.
My point was that they're all run of the mill.

1072
01:08:58.070 --> 01:09:01.730
I mean that's very nice of you to say you get in one where you're like,

1073
01:09:01.731 --> 01:09:06.290
this is not magnet.
Then you know right away you're like,

1074
01:09:06.291 --> 01:09:10.460
well this isn't going to happen.
And then it's just like a whole to do.

1075
01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:13.790
Trying to get out of it.
I guess saving face,

1076
01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:17.030
we even threw around the idea with Joshua.
He's like,
he's like,

1077
01:09:17.031 --> 01:09:20.810
maybe it would happen.
And again this could be very callous and not accurate.

1078
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:24.080
Maybe he would be able to,
if it was like a total 10 like a smoke show,

1079
01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:29.000
well it won't hurt to try as all I said,
it won't know why not.

1080
01:09:29.001 --> 01:09:31.090
I mean we might as well try this.

1081
01:09:31.310 --> 01:09:34.280
I do think it is helpful to talk about this cause I'll bet way more med

1082
01:09:34.281 --> 01:09:38.610
experiences.
Oh I know that it's terrifying to talking about herself.
Uh,

1083
01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:40.310
Josh told me about it.

1084
01:09:40.330 --> 01:09:45.330
I've met at least a handful of people to maybe respond on Twitter to talk about

1085
01:09:45.621 --> 01:09:50.621
your sort of lack of coming and maybe it will reduce the shame for the men going

1086
01:09:51.171 --> 01:09:54.050
through it.
If anybody can relate to coming constantly.

1087
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:59.060
I was like too many a DM and email from people by the way.

1088
01:09:59.061 --> 01:10:02.390
And I'm sure you've heard these advices to where they say like it's the way

1089
01:10:02.391 --> 01:10:06.440
you're jerking off or don't jerk off or don't look at porn.

1090
01:10:06.441 --> 01:10:11.420
These things don't work.
Right.
You've experienced times when I've,

1091
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:13.940
cause obviously porn is very attractive because it's like you come,

1092
01:10:13.941 --> 01:10:15.920
it's like a simulation of sex but you're not having it.

1093
01:10:15.921 --> 01:10:18.290
But you still come and it feels better when you're watching porn a lot of the

1094
01:10:18.291 --> 01:10:20.300
time.
But it's not,

1095
01:10:20.330 --> 01:10:24.540
that's only helped a little bit sometimes just in terms of sensitivity,
but it's,

1096
01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.980
it's not the answer.
It's something else.
If he won't get it.

1097
01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:30.530
People have been messaging in,
here's one,
I don't know it's for Josh,

1098
01:10:30.531 --> 01:10:33.050
but maybe Jake and uh,
somebody wrote in,

1099
01:10:33.051 --> 01:10:36.170
I think I have a solution to Josh is come conundrum.

1100
01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:41.620
It's well documented that only Josh can make Josh come my solution simply put a

1101
01:10:41.871 --> 01:10:46.550
mask of job
hot white trash come down,

1102
01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:50.060
which happens to be with his cock.
We'll be able to tell the difference.

1103
01:10:50.061 --> 01:10:53.780
I believe that tricking Josh his penis into believing that Josh is the only one

1104
01:10:53.781 --> 01:10:55.700
involved.
We'll allow for that big release.

1105
01:10:55.850 --> 01:10:58.940
We're all anxiously waiting for it to the next time that Josh has penis is too

1106
01:10:58.941 --> 01:11:01.110
smart for that.
I don't know.
Maybe it isn't.
Well,

1107
01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:04.280
I think that's a great way for everyone to come.
Frankly.

1108
01:11:04.281 --> 01:11:08.510
I don't think it's just mass.
That's how you have to prove you love yourself.

1109
01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:13.920
I think it's a pretty good idea.
Josh mask.
But Josh come mask.
That's a great,

1110
01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:17.980
make the loved one come in your life.
Terrifying.
God.

1111
01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:24.660
All right,
well this is,
thank you for your insight.
Yeah,
yeah.
Thank you very much.

1112
01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:29.690
That that is fascinating that we have another guest and now it seems to be

1113
01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:31.860
calming.
It is coming up a lot.

1114
01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:37.530
I find that luckily any problem you have,

1115
01:11:37.650 --> 01:11:40.770
there's a forum for it.
You know,
like it's so,
it's like you're not like,

1116
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:43.260
every time I feel like a fucking Weirdo,
it's like if I just tweet it out,

1117
01:11:43.261 --> 01:11:46.050
they're like,
oh no,
I've been through that.
You know,
so that's good.

1118
01:11:46.051 --> 01:11:48.510
Are also terrible because everyone's in pain,
but at least you're not alone.

1119
01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:53.340
You're not.
I do feel lucky to have grown up,
uh,

1120
01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:55.500
like pornography was not what it was,

1121
01:11:55.501 --> 01:11:59.670
what I was a kid or Internet access is the big problem.

1122
01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:01.530
I feel lucky you have kids.

1123
01:12:01.531 --> 01:12:05.550
Are they superior to watch it?

1124
01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:10.830
I'm giving them my passwords and stuff and he's like,
oh,

1125
01:12:10.831 --> 01:12:15.450
I save it in my phone dead,
but I do feel like it would have ruined me.
Right.

1126
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:16.050
If there's,

1127
01:12:16.050 --> 01:12:20.860
I feel like it's having mass effects on your expectations are just so high over

1128
01:12:20.861 --> 01:12:25.860
stimulating to actually see intercourse when you're too young should not be

1129
01:12:25.861 --> 01:12:29.190
seeing that shit.
You need to start slow load.

1130
01:12:33.330 --> 01:12:35.190
When my dad would give me like one,

1131
01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:38.100
like a few times a year he'd be like here's here's like a playboy or something

1132
01:12:38.101 --> 01:12:41.430
like that.
It was like whoa.
And I would like to keep it like in a,

1133
01:12:41.610 --> 01:12:44.610
in like this briefcase at the top of my closet and like,

1134
01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:48.300
and it was a joy so that every time I had to get it out to climb and like get it

1135
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:51.450
and it was the best,
it was like it really meant a lot.

1136
01:12:51.451 --> 01:12:56.130
And those are pictures of like sable of the WWE,
you know,
like,

1137
01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:00.120
like lady,
I was like,
oh my God,
this is my late like it was meant so much.

1138
01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:05.370
And then you had to actually actively fantasize
photo.
Yeah,

1139
01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:06.480
habit,
take you somewhere.

1140
01:13:06.481 --> 01:13:10.350
But now it's like how many hundreds of thousands of videos.

1141
01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:13.230
And I was like,
what am I looking for?

1142
01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:19.110
Gaping buttholes and how many 50 guys coming in one woman's face.

1143
01:13:19.271 --> 01:13:22.620
I love that.
But yeah.
Is that your favorite?
Favorite,
the word,

1144
01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:24.090
if it's 49 it's not enough.

1145
01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:32.770
I used to print jpegs off of playboy.com awesome.

1146
01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:35.460
I once did it,
I,
the first time I tried it,

1147
01:13:35.461 --> 01:13:38.790
I went to playboy.com we had a family community,
family computer.

1148
01:13:39.610 --> 01:13:44.520
Oh my God.
So like by,
and by the way,
in early Internet two like I was,

1149
01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:47.580
I like prayed off of the fact that my mom didn't know what the Internet was,

1150
01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:50.940
so I could delete the search history and she'd be like weird.

1151
01:13:50.941 --> 01:13:53.990
All the internets or are all the websites are gone now it'd be like,
I dunno,

1152
01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:57.330
it's the mystery of the Internet.
All these computers are,
yeah.

1153
01:13:57.540 --> 01:14:02.340
But one time I went to a playboy.com found the perfect image and hit print and

1154
01:14:02.341 --> 01:14:06.870
it just didn't print.
And I was like,
oh,
well.
And then I just walked away.

1155
01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:11.070
And then a few hours later my mom showed up like shaking

1156
01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:14.320
with this image that it,

1157
01:14:14.321 --> 01:14:18.640
it had been put into like the printer like Q or something or was it like legs

1158
01:14:18.641 --> 01:14:22.180
spread
over the shoulder?

1159
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:27.680
I have scoliosis and a sexy,
the playboy doesn't show,

1160
01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:34.150
oh they do like a lot of like Bush shots,

1161
01:14:34.690 --> 01:14:37.690
tasteful bushes,
penthouse and hustler

1162
01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:41.710
fingers inside

1163
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:47.680
someplace they'd have like they have you like squirting at the camera.

1164
01:14:47.710 --> 01:14:51.510
Like it was crazy.
It goes something be like you'd be like mid,
mid,
mid.

1165
01:14:51.870 --> 01:14:54.180
It was just like,
Whoa,
what are we doing?
The hustle girls were like,

1166
01:14:54.190 --> 01:14:57.580
you ready to grow up?
Grown up stuff.
Yeah.

1167
01:14:58.410 --> 01:15:01.710
Babysitter ever.
The center fold.

1168
01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:05.300
And then did she give her likes and dislikes in the penthouse or hustler?

1169
01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:07.480
It wasn't like likes everything.
Yeah,

1170
01:15:08.890 --> 01:15:12.130
it was definitely like I dream about sex all day.
That was their thing.

1171
01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:15.730
I always try to put that that was the fantasy that the man wanted.

1172
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:21.550
I'm insatiable course crazy where it's like every like the truth of adulthood is

1173
01:15:22.121 --> 01:15:24.190
like you have a headache.
You know what I mean?
Like,

1174
01:15:24.191 --> 01:15:27.250
even if you're like a headache and your stomach hurts because we had too much

1175
01:15:27.251 --> 01:15:30.760
lactose.
Yeah.
No one is like just goes man.

1176
01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:36.510
Knowing that person would be so annoying

1177
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:43.220
if you're trying to have a family like the kids.
These kids,

1178
01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:47.170
fuck no,
he's insatiable.

1179
01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:53.530
So I wanted to show you something.
I love a visual.
Yes.

1180
01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:54.960
So we have this uh,

1181
01:15:55.030 --> 01:16:00.030
game we like to call horrible or hilarious and we just show you clips and you

1182
01:16:00.161 --> 01:16:05.130
tell us your honest take.
This is it hilarious.
Is it horrible?
Great.
All right,

1183
01:16:05.790 --> 01:16:06.440
here we go.

1184
01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:07.040
<v 12>Good.
Kip.</v>

1185
01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:11.840
One gentleman was leaving his house right heading out.

1186
01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:15.373
Wow.

1187
01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:22.350
<v 10>Okay.
Well these two are mentally disturbed already.
Well,
I mean,
no,</v>

1188
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:27.340
this is classic is what is funny is this is what funny is.

1189
01:16:27.370 --> 01:16:30.090
Thank you.
The problem,
and this is one of the issues with human,

1190
01:16:30.091 --> 01:16:34.600
unless you just died.
Did we just want you to know he's getting up?
You guys did.

1191
01:16:34.601 --> 01:16:35.201
But here's the thing.

1192
01:16:35.201 --> 01:16:38.020
He let us laugh before he died and I think that's really the thing.

1193
01:16:38.770 --> 01:16:43.570
He didn't get up broken his neck and he's paralyzed.
He's paralyzed.

1194
01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:47.410
He didn't hit his head.
He did not hit his head.
So that's good.
Jake.

1195
01:16:47.411 --> 01:16:51.550
Jake's got back problems.
He left.
Yeah.
Okay.
You know what I love?

1196
01:16:51.551 --> 01:16:54.100
He's that guy that we talked about a couple of weeks ago.

1197
01:16:54.130 --> 01:16:57.380
It's snowing and he's wearing shorts.
There's always that,
hey,

1198
01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:59.950
this guy's always those east coast,
east coast asshole.

1199
01:17:00.010 --> 01:17:04.570
This is what's crazy about this is as like as comedians you're trying to like

1200
01:17:04.571 --> 01:17:08.140
write interesting things.
Nothing will be funnier than someone always funnier,

1201
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:13.250
so hard at comedy and like this will always be,
it's always funnier by the way.

1202
01:17:13.251 --> 01:17:16.130
That's exactly what's,
uh,
what we see when,
you know,
when you have kids,

1203
01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:20.090
especially in cartoons,
just people fucking animal characters.

1204
01:17:20.690 --> 01:17:25.310
Absolutely.
Yeah.
When I was in high school,
my girlfriend was it dancer,

1205
01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:30.560
and not to Brag,
it's pretty fit,
but a one day,

1206
01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:34.910
one day after school,
um,
I was in the dance hall and uh,

1207
01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:37.490
I was like trying to dance moves that they were doing where you're like jumped

1208
01:17:37.491 --> 01:17:39.800
up on one foot sputter out Atlanta on the same foot.

1209
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:41.150
And the first time I tried it,

1210
01:17:41.151 --> 01:17:45.980
I broke my ankle and it was one of the most like I the hardest.

1211
01:17:45.981 --> 01:17:48.140
I've tried not to cry at like tears streamed.

1212
01:17:48.141 --> 01:17:52.050
I like to run out of the fucking dance hall with a broken ankle.
Holy Shit.
Oh,

1213
01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:56.420
did that come off in a technical problem?
Why strong?

1214
01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:01.310
Wow,
this is good.

1215
01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:04.080
This is what I wanted.

1216
01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:09.290
But you feel like that

1217
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:16.160
would work while you were inside?

1218
01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:22.400
I feel like that guys sound as he hit that ground.
It sounds a lot like,

1219
01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:32.320
nope.
What's up?
How are we?

1220
01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:36.420
Can't play it at blue band is telling us.
Okay,

1221
01:18:37.570 --> 01:18:38.760
what about this word

1222
01:18:45.390 --> 01:18:49.820
fix
now?
And that is weird.

1223
01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:53.400
That thing just came off.
Who Do you get

1224
01:18:55.580 --> 01:19:00.410
$3 million trouble?
Yeah.
Oh,
sponsors.
Sponsors get upset.

1225
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:04.220
Oh,
and we play certain clips.
We had McDonald's sponsored this show.

1226
01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:09.260
We painted the set McDonald's colors per their request as part of the deal.

1227
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:12.370
And we played that clip of Terry and they,
boy,

1228
01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:16.120
we played the video and we analyzed it,
puts a pup plug in and

1229
01:19:17.630 --> 01:19:21.210
they dropped out.
Mcdonald's didn't like that now.

1230
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:25.110
And we did it on the first episode of their sponsorship.
Ah,

1231
01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:29.140
and you lost two point $3 million,
which was like the campaign man.

1232
01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:31.550
I'm so sorry.

1233
01:19:32.250 --> 01:19:36.230
We got a steak house arrest and then they fired us because of that clip.

1234
01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:40.940
You just want that clip.
So I keep going back to it now.
He's like,

1235
01:19:40.941 --> 01:19:45.040
maybe not such an artistic integrity.
You want them,

1236
01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:47.660
I'm not going to let somebody talk you out of what I believe.

1237
01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:54.500
I believe how military Terry and his butt plug reviews.

1238
01:19:54.530 --> 01:19:57.330
Wow.
He really tickled your fancy.
He really,

1239
01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:03.650
he really did cost us everything.
All right.
And your Lamborghini.
Yeah,

1240
01:20:03.710 --> 01:20:07.920
yeah,
yeah.
Anyway,
know what'd you guys get one?
No,
no.

1241
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:11.900
I drove Subaru.
They come off again.
Yeah,
I think I got it.
Let me,

1242
01:20:12.490 --> 01:20:14.990
let me just hold it came off again.
Yeah.

1243
01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:19.320
I feel like something that allows me,
Eh,
no matter what,

1244
01:20:19.410 --> 01:20:23.010
if I'm able to achieve success,
I would like to always drive a Subaru.

1245
01:20:23.011 --> 01:20:25.620
So people like,
wow,
look how grounded he is.
You know what I mean?

1246
01:20:25.621 --> 01:20:28.170
Would you really do that?
I love,
it's a good ride,

1247
01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:32.490
but like even endless endless money,
you would just be like,
nope,
sticking to it.

1248
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:36.150
It's just a good ride.
I guess.
When I think about endless money,

1249
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:37.650
it's kind of hard to I you did that,

1250
01:20:37.651 --> 01:20:39.660
you know who did that like exactly what you're saying.

1251
01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:43.260
Is tosh really want to see,
does he drive like just super cool.

1252
01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:47.690
Zach Galifianakis drive like a Prius.
He drives like an old ass man.
What you,

1253
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:50.370
what do you guys drive?
Cause you guys are killing it on cheap.

1254
01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:55.350
I like Jeep Cherokee.
I just don't have much of a neat,
like I don't,

1255
01:20:55.710 --> 01:20:59.220
I feel like I would look terrible in any card that people would be like,

1256
01:20:59.250 --> 01:21:03.790
that's a good call.
I'd be like,
look,
there's a producer that's in your head.
Oh,

1257
01:21:03.791 --> 01:21:06.630
okay.
And the experiences,
it's too fun.
It feels great.

1258
01:21:06.631 --> 01:21:09.450
Of course it doesn't matter.
Not a car guy.
It does.

1259
01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:12.840
That's very fine when you have kids now.

1260
01:21:12.841 --> 01:21:15.840
But like what are some dumb shit you spend money on that you have a decent

1261
01:21:15.841 --> 01:21:17.820
amount of money.
Like what are you doing?
Let's talk about it.

1262
01:21:17.821 --> 01:21:21.390
This guy wants a gold chain.
Oh yeah,
of course.

1263
01:21:21.391 --> 01:21:26.120
40 in a couple,
let's say cane.
It could say that.
Yeah.
Or,

1264
01:21:26.610 --> 01:21:31.500
yeah.
Or,
um,
I feel like,
I thought I told her I was,

1265
01:21:31.501 --> 01:21:33.420
I'm turning 40,
we should celebrate.

1266
01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:37.620
All I'm asking you for is get me a chain with a medallion,
lots of diamonds,

1267
01:21:38.210 --> 01:21:40.500
and then there's no resale value in jewel.

1268
01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:45.090
What's the sell it kind of way someone's gonna fucking jacket.

1269
01:21:45.091 --> 01:21:49.900
Where here brother,
not to fucking,
what's his name?
When he was in his way,

1270
01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:53.460
he got the grill.
That's true.
Danny Brown was,
oh really?
And He,
yeah,

1271
01:21:53.461 --> 01:21:55.080
he was here a few weeks ago.
He was like,
don't do it.
It's like,

1272
01:21:55.081 --> 01:21:57.450
are you talking about,
oh,
cause it was like,
Nah.
He's like,

1273
01:21:57.451 --> 01:22:01.080
I've made a lot of dumb purchases.
And he said he brought like he bought a Cape

1274
01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:07.090
and uh,
like it when it was like couture,
you know,
early on that.

1275
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:11.580
But I feel like it's fun just to buy a couple of dumb things.
Right?
Yeah.
No,

1276
01:22:11.581 --> 01:22:14.300
nothing.
Did you spend your money on anything stupid?
Nothing.
Not really.

1277
01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:15.790
Only mattered even know what I,

1278
01:22:15.791 --> 01:22:19.260
I think I was still afraid it's not going to continue.
Yeah.
So I'm,
I'm afraid.

1279
01:22:19.290 --> 01:22:22.660
You know what I mean?
But I feel like I'd love to spend something,
I,

1280
01:22:22.670 --> 01:22:26.790
I'd love to buy something fucking dumb.
I get like poke a bowls.

1281
01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:30.940
Bowls.
It's just like tuna.
Oh yeah.

1282
01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:35.940
Those are really good buddies with j Hawk who played in the NFL for 10 seasons.

1283
01:22:36.001 --> 01:22:40.680
Yeah.
I'm like,
Yo,
like tell me like,
what do you spend?
What's some like,
you know,

1284
01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:45.630
not necessary expenses like shit you bought.
He was like,
oh,

1285
01:22:45.631 --> 01:22:49.590
like I'll,
I'll just buy like mulch from my yard.
He's like,

1286
01:22:49.591 --> 01:22:52.130
I invested intelligently and then he goes,
one,

1287
01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:56.970
one summer we rented a house on this lake.
I'm like,
yeah.
He's like,
so that's one.

1288
01:22:57.950 --> 01:23:01.260
Are you serious?
10 Nfl seasons?
He was like,
yeah.
He's like,

1289
01:23:01.261 --> 01:23:04.090
I'll just order shit on him.
That SmartVault one.
Yeah,
of course it is.
No,

1290
01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:08.000
it's like,
tell me something reckless and stupid,
but I agree with the,

1291
01:23:08.110 --> 01:23:11.500
the thrill for me is going to,
you know,
trade.

1292
01:23:11.501 --> 01:23:13.840
There was Joe and just buying what I want.

1293
01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:17.980
I think that is what success is,
is if you get the bill at dinner,

1294
01:23:18.010 --> 01:23:20.740
not even looking at what it is like just be like,
here you go,
here's the card.

1295
01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:23.470
I think that's what success is.
It's just literally like here you go.

1296
01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:24.950
I don't have to worry about money.

1297
01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:30.120
<v 0>Yeah,
I'm saying to make crazy purchases,
but it is fun for stories</v>

1298
01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:31.910
<v 10>like I love to hear your story.</v>

1299
01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:36.510
You could spend a chain into gold like you could like you could like make it a

1300
01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:38.040
thing you put on your next special.

1301
01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:42.240
You would probably make money off of you just to find money.

1302
01:23:42.241 --> 01:23:45.960
So maybe what I should do is write it off,
tell production that I need this,

1303
01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:50.710
don't pay for it or have someone donate a listener,
write a bit about it.

1304
01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:53.860
Go Fund me.
There you go.
Fund me for you to how much hatred I would get.

1305
01:23:54.450 --> 01:23:57.210
Or like you're having us by one.

1306
01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:03.720
I just want to $40,000 challenge your problem.
Is that what it would cost?

1307
01:24:03.721 --> 01:24:07.300
Is that what you're thinking?
Damn,
that's crazy.

1308
01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:12.840
Just a bunch of diamonds.
I hate spending money on jewelry.

1309
01:24:12.841 --> 01:24:16.680
I think it's the worst
sneakers,

1310
01:24:16.681 --> 01:24:19.620
like really high end Bart Scott on that.

1311
01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:24.350
There's that a documentary broke,
it's called oh the the 30 for 30 yeah,

1312
01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:26.520
the 30 for 30 and he was like,
I bought a wolf coat.

1313
01:24:27.810 --> 01:24:29.610
Most depressing things I've ever seen in my life.

1314
01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:34.820
It's just about how like overwhelmingly almost all NFL players in a lot of other

1315
01:24:35.111 --> 01:24:38.700
like are broke within five years of being.
But the worst part was like how

1316
01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:43.920
<v 0>they were saying in that documentary they're saying like on payday,</v>

1317
01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:45.160
um,

1318
01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:49.170
cause like I guess NFL checks at least 20 now it's probably all direct deposit.

1319
01:24:49.171 --> 01:24:49.321
Right.

1320
01:24:49.321 --> 01:24:54.030
But it used to be like checks and players are saying they would go into the

1321
01:24:54.031 --> 01:24:57.720
player parking lot and family and friends would be waiting in the player parking

1322
01:24:57.721 --> 01:25:02.370
lot.
Oh.
Like it was like everybody's pay day.
Oh Damn,
that's fucked up.

1323
01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:07.020
<v 10>I mostly just don't want to think about money.
That's like,</v>

1324
01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:09.620
that's the way I want to be.
It is.
We're like,
yeah,

1325
01:25:09.630 --> 01:25:11.370
walk into trader Joe's and it's like,
yeah,
yeah,

1326
01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:13.890
I'll get the chocolate covered pretzels,

1327
01:25:17.850 --> 01:25:21.090
those walk way for cleavers the chocolate one.

1328
01:25:22.290 --> 01:25:24.270
<v 0>This is,
I think,
I don't know,
it's embarrassing,</v>

1329
01:25:24.271 --> 01:25:27.780
but it's Kinda true where like I've gotten into trader Joe's and been like,

1330
01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:30.810
I want to get like good wine and just

1331
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:36.510
<v 10>sort of the trashcan.
No,
do saw that.
Like all the prices are so cheap.</v>

1332
01:25:36.511 --> 01:25:40.770
And I'm like,
do you have anything more expensive?
And uh,
and then,
but like,

1333
01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:42.450
I don't know what I'm talking about with wine.

1334
01:25:42.810 --> 01:25:45.870
I'm just trying to buy a more expensive one.
And they're like,

1335
01:25:45.871 --> 01:25:47.910
well this is a great deal.
I'm like,
I don't want a great deal.

1336
01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:53.120
Do you have anything like $30?
But everything's like four 99 and uh,

1337
01:25:53.121 --> 01:25:55.350
I dunno.
I feel like it,
they'd be lucky with wine cause you,

1338
01:25:55.351 --> 01:25:58.890
I don't know what the fuck.
So it doesn't,

1339
01:25:58.891 --> 01:26:01.940
whether it's $200 or nothing.
Do you guys read that?
Uh,

1340
01:26:01.950 --> 01:26:02.880
there's this book about this guy.

1341
01:26:02.881 --> 01:26:06.800
I think there's a documentary called sour grapes or this guy conned the like

1342
01:26:06.801 --> 01:26:09.700
high end wine industry because it turns out none of them know what they're

1343
01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:14.660
[inaudible] me like frauds.
Yeah.
Such a good,

1344
01:26:14.661 --> 01:26:17.950
this is a movie.
Yeah.
There's a documentary about,
and there's a book the,

1345
01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:22.130
the documentary's called sour grapes and he basically like learn how to fake

1346
01:26:22.131 --> 01:26:24.860
labels from like Bordeaux,
you know what I mean?

1347
01:26:24.861 --> 01:26:28.010
And was like in selling it to the richest motherfuckers in the country.

1348
01:26:28.011 --> 01:26:31.190
And I could go to like trader Joe's and combine cheap wines,

1349
01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:35.480
taste expensive cause he had a good Palette and the FBI fucking got him and he

1350
01:26:35.481 --> 01:26:39.240
was,
he'd sell them for like tens of thousands of dollars.
It's like $4.

1351
01:26:39.410 --> 01:26:42.170
And he got away.
He got away with it for years.
He like con,

1352
01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:44.520
like all these rich white men.
I just saw one on

1353
01:26:44.770 --> 01:26:46.400
<v 0>the minutes,
which is not a con,</v>

1354
01:26:46.401 --> 01:26:51.401
that's like the spin on it where there's this guy who was in Michigan and he

1355
01:26:53.001 --> 01:26:56.680
went into a liquor store to,
and uh,

1356
01:26:56.780 --> 01:27:00.770
he had just retired and found the,
uh,
uh,
a lottery game.

1357
01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:03.830
I forget what it's called,
like windfall or something like that.

1358
01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:07.670
And it was just like a,
a math equation that he did in his head.

1359
01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:10.700
It was like if you get all five numbers,
you win.

1360
01:27:10.701 --> 01:27:12.740
But if you get four of the five,

1361
01:27:12.741 --> 01:27:17.260
you still get some amount and if you get three of the lesser amount.
Yeah.

1362
01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:20.060
And he said like in a minute,
he was like,
oh,

1363
01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:24.320
so I could definitely win money every time if I buy enough of these.

1364
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:30.790
So then he just started doing that and it just grew and grew and grew and grew.

1365
01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:37.240
And so eventually he won a total of like 26 million doing this.

1366
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:43.000
And like then getting like a pool it by getting friends to watch go.

1367
01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:46.640
Then Michigan shut it down.
They were just like,
we're done doing the same.

1368
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:48.830
And then Pennsylvania was like,
well you can do it here.

1369
01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:52.700
So then he just started driving out there to play it.
And then eventually,

1370
01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:56.150
you know,
FBI starts going like,
Hey,

1371
01:27:56.151 --> 01:27:59.360
this one guy has won this game like 150 times.

1372
01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:02.570
So they launched an investigation.
They're like,
yeah,

1373
01:28:02.571 --> 01:28:05.690
he just solved a math equation.
So there was no,

1374
01:28:05.691 --> 01:28:10.280
and I wish I would stumble on some shit that,
oh my God,
it makes me,
I was like,

1375
01:28:11.150 --> 01:28:14.630
fuck.
He just,
he just kept just,
he was like,

1376
01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:17.330
and then he goes in the air and he's like,
I just can't believe

1377
01:28:17.930 --> 01:28:21.000
<v 10>who else can do this kind of math.
He's like,</v>

1378
01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:27.980
he's like,
it's a simple equation.
It does feel you do have to work really hard.

1379
01:28:28.430 --> 01:28:30.980
I mean,
comedy,
you don't have to worry.
Yeah.
No,
you have to work really hard.

1380
01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:33.590
You have to work really hard.
It's like a great way to make a living.

1381
01:28:33.591 --> 01:28:38.470
But I would love to just win the lottery.
I would not be fun.
No pressure.
Yeah.

1382
01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:42.840
Like you just go like,
oh,
I mean I do it,
but yeah,
all my bills.
Yeah.

1383
01:28:43.010 --> 01:28:47.270
It doesn't matter.
Yeah.
Lottery covers my bills
in your pocket.

1384
01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:52.210
My pocket.
I keep a Dildo in my pocket.
Yeah.
What's it for?
Um,

1385
01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:57.140
chair squeaking.
It's your chair squeaks when you,
if that's the sound,

1386
01:28:57.910 --> 01:29:02.310
the keys jangling or something.
Okay.
Guys know each other.

1387
01:29:02.311 --> 01:29:06.630
Dad and mom.
Mommy and dad?
Well,
not,

1388
01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:09.820
not daddy.
Yeah.
Sometimes with the kids around Mommy,

1389
01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:14.850
we call her mommy.
That's how I see it on the show.
Oh,
homies,

1390
01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:19.140
are you going to have kids?
What's going on?
I don't know.

1391
01:29:20.150 --> 01:29:22.410
It feels like one of those things where like I'm like,
I dunno,

1392
01:29:22.411 --> 01:29:25.080
and then cut to five years,
I'm like desperately tried to have a kid.

1393
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:28.590
I don't know.
I just feel like my kid will be fucking crazy.

1394
01:29:28.591 --> 01:29:32.550
So I don't know if that's exciting.
I mean,
I,
I,
the thing is you have with,

1395
01:29:32.551 --> 01:29:35.360
with Comedians,
like most comedians I know,

1396
01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:38.040
like they're getting to the age where they're like going to or having kids or,

1397
01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:40.830
and it's like the,
some of these people,
the way that I know them,

1398
01:29:41.130 --> 01:29:44.130
it's crazy to me,
they're reproducing like,
it's like really scary.

1399
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:48.540
I know what it's like,
but it almost just feels inevitable for everyone.

1400
01:29:48.541 --> 01:29:50.910
So I feel like saying I'm not going to do it is dumb,

1401
01:29:50.911 --> 01:29:54.180
but I don't want one because I'm selfish.
Oh,

1402
01:29:54.730 --> 01:29:58.710
that's good to know.
But I mean,
don't,
were you selfish?

1403
01:29:58.711 --> 01:30:02.700
What were you not selfish before?
Like selfish?
Yeah,
yeah.
You are.

1404
01:30:03.670 --> 01:30:08.670
<v 0>I think because I like grew up in a house where it was such a priority,</v>

1405
01:30:09.971 --> 01:30:12.610
I guess family,
I always thought it was just like automated.

1406
01:30:14.110 --> 01:30:18.100
The only thing that kept me from like really actively pushing for kids a while

1407
01:30:18.101 --> 01:30:19.480
ago.
You're fun.

1408
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:23.303
<v 10>MMM.</v>

1409
01:30:23.890 --> 01:30:28.210
<v 0>The only thing that kept me from doing it earlier was just that I was like
broke.</v>

1410
01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:28.960
Uh Huh.

1411
01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:31.360
<v 10>Or pushing for that and I didn't want to do it yet,</v>

1412
01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:34.960
but I would have found another one.
Right.
But when you guys met,

1413
01:30:34.961 --> 01:30:38.030
you were like one of the for you talked about it like you both want kids?
No,

1414
01:30:38.110 --> 01:30:41.740
actually when we got married I was terrified of it and um,

1415
01:30:42.310 --> 01:30:45.190
it was something I thought I possibly could do,
but I was like,

1416
01:30:45.191 --> 01:30:47.920
I'm scared and my family's crazy.
I don't know if I could do it.

1417
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:52.220
And then I got into therapy for a long time and then,
yeah,
through therapy I,
I,

1418
01:30:52.630 --> 01:30:55.690
you know,
figured it out and now I love it.
It's the best thing ever.

1419
01:30:56.290 --> 01:30:59.620
Now I'm really into family stuff,
but I never thought I would be.
It's true.

1420
01:30:59.621 --> 01:31:03.580
She was like,
like when I was like,
we were about to get married,
I was like,

1421
01:31:03.581 --> 01:31:06.910
you want to have kids?
Right.
And she was like,
when I was like,
I don't know,

1422
01:31:06.970 --> 01:31:11.170
she was like,
are you out of your fucking mind are so broke when we got married,

1423
01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:17.020
I mean we were,
we were living in the rampart division like Macarthur Park

1424
01:31:20.250 --> 01:31:25.090
and she was like,
do you want to have a kid here featuring on the road?
And like,

1425
01:31:25.130 --> 01:31:28.880
no,
you're losing money basically.
And then I remember right,

1426
01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:31.350
<v 0>like right,
right after we got married,</v>

1427
01:31:31.351 --> 01:31:36.351
like the week after I got a call that I booked like 12 headline weeks at the end

1428
01:31:37.231 --> 01:31:42.231
props and it was such bottom barrel pay that I did like all of those,

1429
01:31:42.901 --> 01:31:45.980
they were almost all in a row and then immediately had to go get a job.
Yeah.

1430
01:31:46.150 --> 01:31:50.190
I was like,
it really make you want it.
Yeah.

1431
01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:54.970
<v 10>Do you feel one of the concern about having kids is,
um,</v>

1432
01:31:55.130 --> 01:31:58.770
although like you have to like go to the kids' schools and like talk to the

1433
01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:00.640
parents and like engage in more bullshit.

1434
01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:03.340
Like that is one thing is you have to be like,
yeah,

1435
01:32:03.341 --> 01:32:07.810
your kids call to come over for a play date.
Like,
yeah,
Pta,
oh my God,

1436
01:32:07.811 --> 01:32:11.620
fundraiser shit.
Yeah.
Can you kind of can't be fully human?
It feels like,

1437
01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:15.010
well that's my concern on now.
Our children are not school age yet.

1438
01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:18.130
We have one kid in like a preschool thing and I dread it.

1439
01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:22.690
I do the bare minimum every time I come home they're like,

1440
01:32:22.691 --> 01:32:25.810
do you want to sign up for this Emily?
I don't want to sign up for shit.
Don't,

1441
01:32:25.811 --> 01:32:28.690
I'm not that mom.
I'm not going to bring stuck in homemade cupcakes.

1442
01:32:28.691 --> 01:32:33.130
Like what's the bare minimum for my son to participate?
I remember like it.

1443
01:32:33.870 --> 01:32:37.720
They're like,
so you're coming Saturday and I was like,
toilet.
And they were like,

1444
01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:42.600
uh,
the like were doing the dance.
I was like the dance.
Like whoa,

1445
01:32:42.730 --> 01:32:45.820
he's been rehearsing.
I was like,
he's three.
He doesn't mention it to shit.

1446
01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:48.610
And then they're like,
well,
do you want to,
are you going to go?
And I was like,

1447
01:32:48.970 --> 01:32:52.480
I don't think so.
She was like,
they're all like,

1448
01:32:52.481 --> 01:32:54.920
they've been rehearsing and I was like,
yeah,

1449
01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:57.870
my wife's out of town so I can't really do it.
Yeah.

1450
01:32:57.910 --> 01:33:02.010
You also have a few more years before not going to things has an effect on them.

1451
01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:04.030
You know what I mean?
You could not go to things right now,

1452
01:33:04.031 --> 01:33:06.640
but when he gets to their playing like soccer or they're playing the flute or

1453
01:33:06.641 --> 01:33:08.970
something,
if you don't go,
it's like my dad doesn't look,
that's fine.

1454
01:33:09.670 --> 01:33:13.300
That's the problem.
I played drums and percussion and uh,

1455
01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:16.060
in grade school about to turn everyone on immediately.

1456
01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:21.100
I know that everyone just got,
but that's the other hell is like,

1457
01:33:21.101 --> 01:33:24.060
what did they start playing an instrument and you have to listen to them suck

1458
01:33:24.230 --> 01:33:29.190
instrument
drums,
drums,
piano.

1459
01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:35.140
That's just in the background is I do a team sport.

1460
01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:36.530
Like what you were talking about

1461
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:45.670
was
what if it's a sport you don't like?

1462
01:33:45.730 --> 01:33:50.450
I remember my sports,
I like tennis.
For me,
I was like always like objects,

1463
01:33:50.460 --> 01:33:53.200
so excited about sports.
And I remember one of my friends,

1464
01:33:53.201 --> 01:33:56.620
this is like 10 years ago,
so way before I had kids.
I was like,
Oh,

1465
01:33:56.621 --> 01:33:59.720
you're having a son,
man,
are you excited about sports?
He was like,
Yo,

1466
01:33:59.740 --> 01:34:01.840
I can't wait to get them into baseball.
And I go,

1467
01:34:01.930 --> 01:34:05.350
what if he doesn't like baseball?
He's like,
Oh,
like what?
I'm like,

1468
01:34:05.351 --> 01:34:06.400
what is he like soccer?
He goes,

1469
01:34:06.401 --> 01:34:10.300
well I won't go to the Games but I'll support them.
And I was like,

1470
01:34:10.450 --> 01:34:13.870
you won't go to the gay.
And he was like,
I don't like soccer but it's your kid.

1471
01:34:14.350 --> 01:34:16.930
And then now I'm like,
Oh yeah,
I'm not really into baseball.

1472
01:34:20.140 --> 01:34:25.120
I just hope you like something,
you know?
Well
just start,

1473
01:34:25.121 --> 01:34:28.150
just start putting football on all the time and it'll just be a part of it.

1474
01:34:30.090 --> 01:34:31.360
You're brainwashing him and put,

1475
01:34:31.530 --> 01:34:34.960
put the posters up in the fuck doesn't room and does it feel that way?

1476
01:34:34.961 --> 01:34:38.860
You're like,
we're brainwashing our kids.
Totally.
Yeah.
And you're just choosing,

1477
01:34:38.861 --> 01:34:42.250
cause you're just exposing them to things.
Like my three year old will say,

1478
01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:46.700
well he'll mention football.
And I'm like,
that's because of do you work?

1479
01:34:46.710 --> 01:34:51.640
Like how do you feel in terms of like them having certain Polish like political

1480
01:34:51.641 --> 01:34:54.490
opinions or religious opinions?
Like are you like,

1481
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:56.490
you can't do that or you'd like,
are you going to be like,

1482
01:34:56.530 --> 01:34:58.560
do whatever you want and you're making,
okay.

1483
01:34:58.670 --> 01:35:01.940
<v 0>Okay.
Yeah.
How's it feel like,
you know,
the older you get,
even with without kids,</v>

1484
01:35:01.941 --> 01:35:04.910
but with kids,
I think you,
you start to see,
you know,

1485
01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:08.840
young people really passionate about something that in your mind you're like,

1486
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:10.440
they don't know what the fuck there.
Yeah,
of course.
Yeah.

1487
01:35:10.610 --> 01:35:15.440
And I think the older you get,
the less it stresses you out.
So I'll be like,
oh,

1488
01:35:15.441 --> 01:35:18.610
that is interesting.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
We're going to go march.
That's good.
Yeah.

1489
01:35:18.970 --> 01:35:21.710
Yeah,
yeah.
I think I'll totally be like,
gotcha.

1490
01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:25.320
<v 10>Yeah.
But I like that sort of antisocial free thinking.</v>

1491
01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:27.750
I try to cultivate that more than anything.

1492
01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:31.410
It's a little anti authority all like they don't know everything.

1493
01:35:31.411 --> 01:35:35.250
Don't listen to these fucking idiots.
[inaudible] turn that on you.
It's fine.

1494
01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:40.050
It's okay.
Can I,
that is,
I've always wanted that,
cause there's a pair of like,

1495
01:35:40.051 --> 01:35:43.140
what's a,
at 1213 they're going to not like you anymore.

1496
01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:47.680
Luckily you guys are pretty,
like,
you have cooler jobs.
Theoretically,

1497
01:35:47.710 --> 01:35:51.600
they won't be cold then,
but like if you don't care,
they'll be like,
dad,

1498
01:35:51.601 --> 01:35:54.890
I watched your comedy.
It's,
oh you're going to hear,
hold on.

1499
01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:58.460
<v 0>Yeah.
And everyone I talked to with kids that are older now,</v>

1500
01:35:58.461 --> 01:36:02.570
like teenage kids 100% they're just like,
you're late to their,

1501
01:36:03.230 --> 01:36:05.540
to their dad.
And they're like,
you know who?
It's funny.

1502
01:36:05.541 --> 01:36:08.510
And they'll always mention someone who they're the guy,
Kevin Hart or something.

1503
01:36:08.511 --> 01:36:11.710
Let's just say someone super famous or someone who's like totally dead.
Right?

1504
01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:14.270
Yeah,
right.
Of course.
Right before you guys go to the,

1505
01:36:14.271 --> 01:36:18.180
I wanted to show you a couple more hilarious clips and just get your,

1506
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:22.670
your reaction.
See if you think it's funny or not.
What the hell?

1507
01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:23.553
What has happened?

1508
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:25.410
<v 2>Ready?</v>

1509
01:36:25.410 --> 01:36:27.140
<v 0>I think he's fishing,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1510
01:36:27.150 --> 01:36:28.800
And they look like shopping on Amazon or something.

1511
01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:34.060
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

1512
01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:51.060
<v 7>see I'm calling fake on this one.
I'm calling too.</v>

1513
01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:55.870
I think that that was play cause nobody runs to help him fast enough.
Well he's,

1514
01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:59.300
he's helping them.
Yeah,
it does.

1515
01:37:00.210 --> 01:37:04.920
<v 0>Does look painful and you see that I felt planned.
That's pretty good acting job.</v>

1516
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:08.160
I feel like,
you know,
get them on the show.
He really sold it.

1517
01:37:09.550 --> 01:37:09.931
<v 10>Well,
I mean,</v>

1518
01:37:09.931 --> 01:37:13.320
don't these guys know that you're going to get your Dick pinched eventually?

1519
01:37:13.321 --> 01:37:18.030
Dylan,
this for generations,
they have like a Dick Cover.
You know what I mean?

1520
01:37:18.031 --> 01:37:21.600
You're fishing in the Amazon.
Their tribal elders would be like,

1521
01:37:21.601 --> 01:37:22.980
but one thing to remember,

1522
01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:27.480
I mean that is Dick.
It is,

1523
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:30.900
it is hard to look at something happening to dicker balls without feeling like

1524
01:37:30.901 --> 01:37:34.260
I'm covering myself right now.
I'm like literally went to start covering myself.

1525
01:37:34.290 --> 01:37:37.830
So maybe you just need to see guys coming more though.
I mean,

1526
01:37:37.831 --> 01:37:41.770
I have seen a lot of coming in my life.
It's usually on a face,

1527
01:37:41.890 --> 01:37:44.730
<v 7>but it's a,
yeah.</v>

1528
01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:52.710
<v 0>Uh,
okay.
Let's see.
Is there another one?
Is there another one?
Oh yeah.
Okay.</v>

1529
01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:58.850
Oh my God.
Pinch Dyckman what do you think pinched his dick?
Was that like a,

1530
01:37:58.890 --> 01:38:03.540
it was like a crab crabs.
Yeah.
Nope.
Oh,
here we go.
This one?

1531
01:38:10.580 --> 01:38:13.910
<v 2>Yeah.
Ah.</v>

1532
01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:16.433
Oh.

1533
01:38:19.010 --> 01:38:21.610
It's a dirty Tampa called the dirty tampon.

1534
01:38:31.270 --> 01:38:33.070
<v 10>Be real either cause I'd shake it.</v>

1535
01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:36.670
That's why I gave you what,

1536
01:38:36.671 --> 01:38:39.690
three or four good seasons that was.

1537
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:44.290
That was a Wolverine Wolverine movie that was like,
what?

1538
01:38:44.291 --> 01:38:48.760
What was that?
Where was that taking place?
I like,

1539
01:38:48.761 --> 01:38:53.290
do you want to taste the tuna?
That was a great line.
I love that.

1540
01:38:53.291 --> 01:38:55.090
I don't even know if that was horrible and hilarious.
That was just,

1541
01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:56.130
that was really impressive.

1542
01:38:56.131 --> 01:38:58.570
It's really just made me think differently about the world.
Well,

1543
01:38:58.571 --> 01:38:59.830
I'm impressed that she could take it

1544
01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:01.360
<v 0>tampon out.
Um,</v>

1545
01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:05.610
<v 10>might've been,
it might've been like plan.</v>

1546
01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:10.270
It doesn't feel like that was insane.
When you take a tampon out,

1547
01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:13.660
you have to be a little smaller.
Slower,
a little more deliberate.
Yeah.

1548
01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:19.150
You know what I mean?
It's not that quick of an endeavor.
I don't know.

1549
01:39:19.151 --> 01:39:23.680
I personally don't rip them out that fast.
I do have like vivid

1550
01:39:23.850 --> 01:39:27.240
<v 0>visceral memories of the Times I've been hit the balls in my life though.</v>

1551
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:30.110
It really sticks with you.
Like what gets in your girl?
What?

1552
01:39:30.150 --> 01:39:31.770
It was 11 played soccer.
Yeah.

1553
01:39:31.890 --> 01:39:35.230
I remember a kid did a prank or like his setup.

1554
01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:38.490
I wasn't up in a like the community pool,
you know,

1555
01:39:38.491 --> 01:39:41.250
like at a public pool and this guy,
this kid,

1556
01:39:41.251 --> 01:39:44.730
we both like probably eight or nine,
uh,

1557
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.130
standing in kind of the shallow end and he goes,
what's that like?

1558
01:39:48.450 --> 01:39:49.740
What's on your arm?
And I was like,
what?

1559
01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:53.940
And as he grabbed my arms and he kneed me in the class and I just collapsed

1560
01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:57.840
crying dodger that comes with that.
It's always supplies.
Yeah.

1561
01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:02.820
I was once on a school ride home from a band thing.
Again,
not to brag,

1562
01:40:02.821 --> 01:40:05.560
but I played percussion.
Okay.
And I was,

1563
01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:10.110
I was sleeping like this and I was,

1564
01:40:10.350 --> 01:40:12.930
I woke up to a guy who came up to me,

1565
01:40:12.931 --> 01:40:17.010
I'd like just from the back with a,
with like a mallet,

1566
01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:18.430
<v 10>the back of the balls.</v>

1567
01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:21.590
There was like a time during high school where it was funny to play the game

1568
01:40:21.670 --> 01:40:25.060
ball tap.
And it's like,
that's not a funny game that goes.

1569
01:40:25.890 --> 01:40:30.460
And the fast guys that it had,
the loose written,
I am not funny,

1570
01:40:31.090 --> 01:40:32.410
like a towel of a hand.

1571
01:40:32.411 --> 01:40:36.220
Like it's make it snap thing you gotta do to get your nuts.

1572
01:40:36.221 --> 01:40:39.310
Tap like that is really overreact.
I think you need to,

1573
01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:44.560
you need to carry a gun.
That's what guns are for.
I only want guns for ball taps.

1574
01:40:44.561 --> 01:40:47.410
Faults absent that.
Cool.
Cool.
About half at all.

1575
01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:51.970
You getting furious or you get mad when the kid accidentally kicked her nights

1576
01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:55.870
and that's a,
that's a real,
by the way they stomp.
Oh,

1577
01:40:55.871 --> 01:41:00.290
I bet it makes you see white and you're just like,
oh fuck yeah.
I knew.
You know,

1578
01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:03.830
you can only hit him so hard.
No,
of course.
With your,
with your boss.

1579
01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:08.520
Do you guys have any live dates coming up?
Do you want to plug in?

1580
01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:11.650
If you want to check out?
I've run a show in Los Angeles called good heroin.

1581
01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:15.080
You did the first year anniversary,
but at the echo at a,

1582
01:41:15.230 --> 01:41:19.630
it's every Saturday at stories,
books and cafe and I,
my buddy Jeff stages did it.

1583
01:41:19.690 --> 01:41:23.380
Yeah.
Yeah.
He was just done.
It's really fucking fun and it's a good show.
Yeah.

1587
01:41:35.620 --> 01:41:38.200
all the shows.
Oh Shit.
Your watch as much as we want.

1588
01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:41.840
When I liked about your show is that it really captures the,

1589
01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:46.120
the horrible suck of corporate life.
Like,
Oh yeah.

1590
01:41:46.410 --> 01:41:50.590
It's so great.
We're so lucky.
We don't have to,
we only have to sell out to them.

1591
01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:54.070
We don't have to work at those offices.
No,
it's so great.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1592
01:41:54.071 --> 01:41:56.920
Congratulations on it.
Thank you guys.
Thank you guys again for Kevin.

1593

Thanks for having us.
Thank you.

1594
01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:04.200
We'll be right back and we are back with a guy who just like a Jamaican has 11

1604

1605
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:46.140
She said Ryan Gosling or I ain't gon love Jake.

I like Jackie's talented.
Jake and Goslin aren't talented.

1607
01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:54.990
Well,

I'm sorry.
Not talented.
They're not,
they're super talented.
Correction.

1608
01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:58.140
They're not very manly.
Yeah.
Bradley Cooper's man.

1609
01:42:58.141 --> 01:43:02.710
But I have manly at home,
so when I eat out I want to eat all you want.
Right.

1610
01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:06.510
You want a twink on the side?
Yeah.

1614

<v 10>Yeah.
Now we're talking.
You go black girl.
Oh yeah,

1616
01:43:21.770 --> 01:43:22.640
<v 13>Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.</v>

1617
01:43:22.641 --> 01:43:26.310
We went to my first Laker game and I had a dream that night that was,

1618
01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:29.060
my mom had a big dog.
I had to put a bib around her neck.

1619
01:43:29.061 --> 01:43:32.960
She was just like salvage.
Yeah,
like a full record.

1620
01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:35.750
And she was like,
can we go to more Laker game?
And I was like,

1621
01:43:35.751 --> 01:43:40.080
you've never talked about love and basketball.
She's like,
but these guys are so,

1622
01:43:41.110 --> 01:43:43.880
so good at basketball.
I want to sit in that.

1623
01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:47.120
I want to sit in the Jack Nicholson seats so they're dogs can swing as they run

1624
01:43:47.121 --> 01:43:50.250
past me and I can really see the dealing with here.

1625
01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:55.130
I want get my face smacked by a dog.
That'll do it.
You sit Kate's court size,

1626
01:43:55.131 --> 01:43:59.020
you get some taking your face.
I'm fixated on them too.
Hey,
can I ask you?

1627
01:43:59.050 --> 01:44:01.430
So as an athlete,
Brennan,

1628
01:44:01.460 --> 01:44:05.810
how come they're dicks don't swing more as they're running their impressions

1629
01:44:06.060 --> 01:44:10.580
shorts now at that must make it pretty sweaty down there.
It gets pretty grimy.

1630
01:44:11.090 --> 01:44:16.040
I bet there's mistakes after a game,
but the whole shaft is tore up.

1631
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:21.020
Tore out ass cracks guy.
Imagine eating that post game button.
No,

1632
01:44:21.110 --> 01:44:25.180
no shower.
No I would not.
But you could just stand

1633
01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:33.230
those guys.
Fuck so much
more than anyone else.

1634
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:38.520
NBA guys,
first of all,
first of all,

1635
01:44:39.210 --> 01:44:43.510
it's a great question.
First of all,

1636
01:44:44.230 --> 01:44:49.230
you're you're gifted physical specimen and in most in in reality these guys are

1637
01:44:51.891 --> 01:44:53.780
just larger human beings.

1638
01:44:53.781 --> 01:44:58.781
Then like 99.99999% of an average size basketball professors like six,

1639
01:45:00.861 --> 01:45:04.220
seven,
he's a fucking giant queue.
Some of these dudes,

1640
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:08.800
six ten seven one two 60 to 300 black,

1641
01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:13.280
there's not,
and here's the thing,
you're paid out of your mind.

1642
01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:16.820
Guaranteed money.
Yeah.
You're a piece of shit that rides the bench.

1643
01:45:16.821 --> 01:45:19.310
You get like 9 million a year at least,
you know.

1644
01:45:19.311 --> 01:45:23.150
And then the ballers are so out of control ball and they're making like,

1645
01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:23.901
you know,

1646
01:45:23.901 --> 01:45:28.370
40 million guaranteed a year just playing and another 40 like do you guys make

1647
01:45:28.371 --> 01:45:31.310
100 million?
The other thing where everyone wants to suck them off,

1648
01:45:31.311 --> 01:45:34.400
your wants to suck him off cause the one of the only sports to where there's no

1649
01:45:34.401 --> 01:45:35.350
helmet protected,

1650
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:40.750
there's nothing and there's only 11 of them per team and that's the NFL helmets

1651
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:45.710
on.
There's 53 of them.
Like it was just my thing.
The culture of the NBA is dope.

1652
01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:49.580
It's run.
The culture is actually,
it's,
it's,

1653
01:45:50.090 --> 01:45:52.070
it's dictated by the players.

1654
01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:57.710
The players union is very strong and the culture is like,
it's us.

1655
01:45:57.740 --> 01:46:01.850
We're the best basketball players were the best 400 basketball players in the

1656
01:46:01.851 --> 01:46:06.500
world.
And we put on a show and they fucked and they,
fuck I update.

1657
01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:11.710
How about Tristan Thompson?
He's fucking everything.
Yeah.
Friends,
sisters,

1658
01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:15.320
moms.
He's a good looking dude.
And then whenever somebody,
yeah,

1659
01:46:15.321 --> 01:46:18.700
when someone's like,
what are you doing?
He's like,
I'm having,
I'm a ball.

1660
01:46:18.701 --> 01:46:21.410
Or what do we do my bed?

1661
01:46:23.090 --> 01:46:25.760
And then they'll be like,
the girls are like,
that's true.
Yeah.

1662
01:46:25.930 --> 01:46:29.090
It's all good though.
It's,
it is like you signed up for it.
Here's the thing,

1663
01:46:29.091 --> 01:46:29.810
if you,

1664
01:46:29.810 --> 01:46:34.640
if you marry or just our dating an NBA player and he ends up fucking around on

1665
01:46:34.641 --> 01:46:38.200
you and you pretend that you're surprised,
you're dumb.
You're dumb.

1666
01:46:39.110 --> 01:46:43.160
That's what happened with Kobe.
Kobe,
beef man.

1667
01:46:43.161 --> 01:46:45.500
Kobe beef and yeah,
her,
the ring.
And that was it.

1668
01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:47.710
That's kind of what you sign up for.
It is,

1669
01:46:48.140 --> 01:46:50.460
you know they're going to get sucked off on the road.
Yes.

1670
01:46:50.730 --> 01:46:51.750
That's part of the deal.

1671
01:46:51.930 --> 01:46:55.730
And they're now their hose are so different than other sports.
Their hose,

1672
01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:57.750
they have little ratchet bro.
Yeah,
they,
they,

1673
01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:02.220
they know that they know the schedule.
They know the team hotels.

1674
01:47:02.460 --> 01:47:06.060
They wait at the hotel.
They know the spots.
Yeah,
exactly.

1675
01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:09.070
It's like high end lot lizards.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And they,

1676
01:47:09.090 --> 01:47:11.970
and they want to get pregnant of the original Jersey chasers,

1677
01:47:13.050 --> 01:47:16.500
but also there'll be one and then the whole starting five,

1678
01:47:16.501 --> 01:47:19.800
she'll suck the squad off.
That's what I'm talking about right there.

1679
01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:22.320
Now I just ran our producer,
our home,

1680
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:27.950
no curfew for the NBA so those guys can stay out cause that's a huge problem.

1681
01:47:28.430 --> 01:47:30.360
He's like,
what am I supposed to fuck?
Yeah.
What are you talking about?

1682
01:47:30.361 --> 01:47:32.370
We're playing basketball.
The God damn time.
We got the fuck at night.

1683
01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:35.760
But you're getting like 20 year old boys with an incredible amount of money and

1684
01:47:35.761 --> 01:47:40.620
they don't have a curfew.
That's silly.
And all the Nike's they can handle.
Right.

1685
01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:44.180
And they,
but what,
they don't show up in time to go to bed to rest for the game.

1686
01:47:44.181 --> 01:47:47.580
So that's the thing is you have that,
you have that thing where first of all,

1687
01:47:47.610 --> 01:47:50.520
there are games you would watch if you really follow the NBA where you were like

1688
01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:54.330
these dudes stayed out late.
Last a motherfucker.

1689
01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:58.990
They me with baseball to the end hockey,
we'll get hammered.
But in,

1690
01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:02.590
in baseball and basketball,
he seasons are long.

1691
01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:06.390
Basketball starts in November and if you make it to the finals,

1692
01:48:06.391 --> 01:48:10.230
you're playing in June,
that's all long fucking all over.

1693
01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:12.810
And there's only a laugh enough them.
Yeah,
they get to know,

1694
01:48:12.811 --> 01:48:17.520
get the best hose and every city.
What about being a fighter?
Did you,
what?

1695
01:48:17.521 --> 01:48:18.890
What's the host situation?

1696
01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:29.070
Let's talk about the cage rat.
There's a few cage rats,

1697
01:48:29.071 --> 01:48:32.760
but it's not like the NBA because they know that you,
you know,

1698
01:48:32.761 --> 01:48:35.550
unless you're a Conor McGregor fricking Brock Lesnar,

1699
01:48:35.551 --> 01:48:38.670
you're getting probably paid the same that they are.
So it's not that flashy.

1700
01:48:38.700 --> 01:48:42.540
Right,
right.
The other thing is I find like in basketball,
you know,

1701
01:48:43.290 --> 01:48:45.510
win or lose,
they're like,
that is the shit.

1702
01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:49.320
I feel like there's this such an emotion attached to like a girl who's like,

1703
01:48:49.570 --> 01:48:53.950
I'm targeting this bad ass.
And then he lost it.
She's like,

1704
01:48:54.150 --> 01:48:56.050
where's the other guy kicked your ass?
You know,
like,

1705
01:48:56.130 --> 01:48:59.040
it's gonna be weird because you might lose a basketball game,

1706
01:48:59.041 --> 01:48:59.910
but you're still the man.

1707
01:48:59.911 --> 01:49:03.100
Like you're James Hart and you skill still scored 40 points,
right?

1708
01:49:03.180 --> 01:49:06.710
You're still getting sucked off,
flip in the air and dunk like,
yeah,

1709
01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:08.340
that was the sheer amount of loss.
But Bitch,

1710
01:49:08.341 --> 01:49:11.580
I'm talking about a DDA is I'm going to all star game in fighting.
It's like,

1711
01:49:12.030 --> 01:49:16.920
well,
no,
I got knocked out.
That dude's better.
You're the loser.
That's rough.

1712
01:49:16.921 --> 01:49:18.810
That's kind of cage rats don't like,

1713
01:49:21.110 --> 01:49:25.460
does she hang out after like,
it's all in the eyes,
right?
Don't you just fucking

1714
01:49:27.780 --> 01:49:32.140
k Trad
salivating like you a basketball game.

1715
01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:33.630
Did you have the pre fight?
Uh,

1716
01:49:33.730 --> 01:49:38.250
there's always been that thing about sex and you know,
a professional myth.

1717
01:49:38.430 --> 01:49:40.880
But I mean,
so night before plus nuts whenever you can.

1718
01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:43.620
Don't hold it in it's old school.

1719
01:49:43.630 --> 01:49:47.710
Would you take a cage right and the night before?
Uh,
yeah,
I would.
I'm not mad.

1720
01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:52.000
Yeah.
Yeah.
What do you call it?
What do you call comedy hose.
Chocolate fuckers.

1721
01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:55.780
All right.
Little old in it.
It is old,
but that's just,

1722
01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:59.840
it's something like my mom would say maybe,
I mean your mind eyes.
Mouth fuckers.

1723
01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:03.190
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
It's an old saying,
but you're right.
You want to update it.

1724
01:50:03.191 --> 01:50:04.740
Let's up to you.
That's up to,
let's come up with something.

1725
01:50:04.750 --> 01:50:09.740
The three of us are creative.
What is a rat?
What is another word for Idaho?
Yeah.

1726
01:50:10.940 --> 01:50:15.310
We need a,
we need a little,
yeah.
Skank what's a new word for a slut?

1727
01:50:15.910 --> 01:50:20.470
Exactly.
Thought sled is such a timeless word.
Hooker.
Um,

1728
01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:24.340
let's see.
Mars finding hilarious horror.
Yeah.

1729
01:50:26.190 --> 01:50:29.680
I feel like we need some sort of animal attached to it.

1730
01:50:31.170 --> 01:50:34.740
Punch a punch line.
Hooker.
I don't know the hook.

1731
01:50:34.750 --> 01:50:38.090
Hucker and I know,
I'm trying to think of words for punching little cone.

1732
01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:43.270
Yeah.
By the time it will just look at submissions.
Don't worry about it.

1733
01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:46.600
So how do you know they're a cage?
Right?
So you're timing the eyes like you,

1734
01:50:46.601 --> 01:50:48.940
meaning you see the girl in the audience or this is a hub.

1735
01:50:48.940 --> 01:50:53.500
It's like in your locker.
You can get some laugh lizards.

1736
01:50:53.501 --> 01:50:57.520
You can get say half laugh lizard cage rats.

1737
01:50:57.521 --> 01:51:00.640
You can get some Jersey chasers.
The DMS man,

1738
01:51:01.090 --> 01:51:05.090
they was down at the ams is open.

1739
01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:09.760
They slide into your dms is what they say.
Right?
Slide it hard

1740
01:51:12.650 --> 01:51:17.410
wood in Vegas.
How see you there.
Well,
when I was fine,
I retired six years ago,

1741
01:51:17.411 --> 01:51:20.470
so dms really wasn't that big of a deal.
Right?

1742
01:51:20.650 --> 01:51:22.570
But even now if I go into a city,

1743
01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:26.560
you don't have a fiance or you want to city Fresno,
Sacramento.

1744
01:51:26.561 --> 01:51:31.330
Whenever I open my dabs tits.
Wow,
that's weird.
That doesn't happen.

1745
01:51:32.380 --> 01:51:36.130
It never happens to you.
Zero Shit Tom.
I get some cool guys.

1746
01:51:36.131 --> 01:51:38.230
This let them really cool guys.
We're going to do this.

1747
01:51:38.231 --> 01:51:39.460
Let's be in the circle of trust.

1748
01:51:40.330 --> 01:51:45.270
Nothing near good looking dude guys.
I get a lot of dudes.
Yeah,

1749
01:51:45.290 --> 01:51:50.110
of course.
Loads are just like I'm putting it out there.
A Guy,
I'll just be like,

1750
01:51:50.111 --> 01:51:54.910
I don't know.
And it's got like a,

1751
01:51:54.911 --> 01:51:59.440
you know,
it's like those guys had the same mentality that straight guys do.

1752
01:51:59.710 --> 01:52:04.610
Chasing tail right there.
Just like for it numbers game.
Maybe he'll bite.

1753
01:52:04.630 --> 01:52:07.810
Maybe it's feeling Kate sent shop a picture of my balls and then he didn't

1754
01:52:07.811 --> 01:52:12.540
respond.
I don't know.
Not a big deal.
Go to try.
So you get like tit,
tit picks.

1755
01:52:12.610 --> 01:52:14.740
Y'All get some weird shit man.

1756
01:52:14.741 --> 01:52:19.090
She know about them not to.
Doesn't check my phone.

1757
01:52:19.091 --> 01:52:20.590
I'm sure if she had her body is ridiculous.

1758
01:52:20.591 --> 01:52:25.420
I'm sure she gets some ridiculous dms.
Yeah.

1759
01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:29.560
Yeah.
Doesn't she wait?
She works in Sports,
right?

1760
01:52:29.660 --> 01:52:34.660
Do you use to Mama fulltime Mama?
Yeah,
but when she worked in sports athletes,

1761
01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:38.620

1762
01:52:40.750 --> 01:52:41.650

Damn homie.

1764
01:52:47.170 --> 01:52:50.150
<v 0>You know what this is.
This is a good time to bring this up.</v>

1765
01:52:50.151 --> 01:52:53.540
So Josh Potter,
who's a great comedian,

1766
01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:58.340
who else works here with us doing the show?
He has a thing.
He has a,

1767
01:52:58.341 --> 01:53:02.690
he can't come during sex like he can.
He's a straight man.

1768
01:53:02.691 --> 01:53:05.990
He's a straight man.
Was He?
Yeah,

He's right there with the beer.

1769
01:53:06.770 --> 01:53:11.570
He fucks.
Okay.
He fucks the man with the glasses.
Yes.
As me.

1770
01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:14.600

Okay.
Fucks.
He can get latest from here.

1771
01:53:14.630 --> 01:53:17.360
He can get in there and he cannot finish.

1772
01:53:17.570 --> 01:53:21.860
So what we did is we put it out there.

1775
01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:35.420
Fuck yeah.
Ever since we put it out there,

1776
01:53:35.780 --> 01:53:38.600

1777
01:53:38.601 --> 01:53:41.390
Watch the show had been sending him messages like,

1778
01:53:41.570 --> 01:53:45.650

1781
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:55.790
He told me some of his responses and I was like,

They're like,
Yo,

1782
01:53:55.791 --> 01:53:59.330
let me suck you off him.
Like that'd be fantastic.
Exactly.
That's me.

1783
01:53:59.630 --> 01:54:04.190
It'd be like Nido and I told her I go when Shabazz y'all go take,

1786
01:54:12.630 --> 01:54:13.010
<v 0>okay.</v>

1787
01:54:13.010 --> 01:54:15.770
<v 11>Football team ever.
The buffalo bills anybody puts on the red,</v>

1788
01:54:15.771 --> 01:54:18.800
white and blue is my hero.
So hold on here.
Single Josh.

1789
01:54:18.890 --> 01:54:22.830
The thing is is I played as many football games for the bills is youtube.

1790
01:54:23.130 --> 01:54:26.840
Let's relax there.
I mean you put on the helmet,
you're a hero to me.

1791
01:54:26.841 --> 01:54:31.280
So I mean,
I'm sure in a like high school and college and stuff,

1792
01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:33.470
I never had that athletes swag.
I mean,

1793
01:54:33.471 --> 01:54:35.750
I'm sure you were like ringing your dick out all the time

1794
01:54:38.020 --> 01:54:42.690
in rugby.
I guess like it was just so soggy constantly.
Like what's that?

1795
01:54:43.850 --> 01:54:47.820
What's that like?
Did you have your rebel?
He's not wrong.
Nasty.

1796
01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:53.000
You did.
Did you do well Tom?
No,
I was,
I wasn't up there.
She's better than him,

1797
01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:57.730
but I didn't feel like
I did all right.
I was not,

1798
01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:01.610
I was not prolific in any,
in any good looking Gal.
Christine,
I'm sure you did.

1799
01:55:01.611 --> 01:55:02.870
Well,
I could have,

1800
01:55:02.871 --> 01:55:06.710
but I was raised in an era where aids was a big thing and I was so afraid of

1801
01:55:06.711 --> 01:55:10.190
getting aids.
Just stuff that I was always real then.
Yeah.

1802
01:55:10.191 --> 01:55:13.280
So I'm kind of battled over.
Age was like a pop.

1803
01:55:13.290 --> 01:55:16.610
She's 53 67.
No,
but um,
you know what?

1804
01:55:16.611 --> 01:55:19.760
I'm built for marriage and monogamy.
I used to have long term boyfriends.

1805
01:55:19.790 --> 01:55:22.280
I wasn't a good dater.
I'm not a good hookup girl.

1806
01:55:22.281 --> 01:55:24.320
He was supposed to be my first one.
Nightstand.

1807
01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:27.030
<v 0>This guy now look at it and now we're married.
I did,</v>

1808
01:55:27.190 --> 01:55:31.370
I did throw it in a few and I,
and I did not date.
I just put it in a hose.

1809
01:55:31.550 --> 01:55:36.120
But I'm saying I didn't rack up crazy numbers.
Yeah.
So,
but now you're,

1810
01:55:36.121 --> 01:55:40.360

Oh,

I bet it's pretty nice.
Yeah.

1811
01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:44.130
I can just tell by the way he sturdy.
Good.
Everybody.

1812
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:48.660

Okay.

Let me ask you this.</v>

1813
01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:50.170
Do you do those hours?

1814
01:55:51.570 --> 01:55:54.930
Do you know the names of every girl you ever slept with Lina?

1815
01:55:56.760 --> 01:55:59.130
She gave me shit for that.
She was like,

1816
01:55:59.131 --> 01:56:04.131
A hall like if so shop I will give you a $20 million.

1817
01:56:04.780 --> 01:56:09.390
You can name 25 of them.

ejaculated in me.
I know their name.

1819
01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:18.720
That's why I don't like the idea of some guy.
But not that you haven't lived?
No,

1820
01:56:18.721 --> 01:56:21.300
apparently not as nasty.
I think it's fucking gross.

1821
01:56:21.301 --> 01:56:24.330
Like I actually go like there was the one with the missing leg.

Right?

1824
01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:36.660

1870
01:59:28.511 --> 01:59:31.440
Take a poop when you call.
It's just a fan reference.
That doesn't mean shit.

02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:18.200
<v 11>you know,
hone your aura here with myself.
So you wouldn't say bitch.
No,</v>

1884
02:00:18.201 --> 02:00:20.160
I wouldn't say bitch.
But a girl messages you,

1885
02:00:20.161 --> 02:00:23.870
let's say you're single and she's like,
yeah,
Hey,
uh,
Brendan,

1886
02:00:23.871 --> 02:00:28.310
I'd love to make you come.
When you're in Houston,
you're response is,

1887
02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:32.600
see a march.
All right.
There you good?
Okay,
perfect.

1888
02:00:32.630 --> 02:00:34.730
I'll hit you up when I'm in town.
That's good.
Paul,

1889
02:00:34.731 --> 02:00:37.580
I'll hit you up when I'm in town.
Is that a good response to this lady?

1890
02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:42.020
And then you,
then you call on the female way.
Let me know if you're an ally.

1891
02:00:42.021 --> 02:00:44.760
We need to start following up with that more.
That's better.
Okay.
I'm like,

1892
02:00:44.761 --> 02:00:46.580
I'm on the west coast cause here's the deal man.

1893
02:00:46.700 --> 02:00:51.200
You might get a hold of fly herself out
Thursday and she's like,

1894
02:00:51.201 --> 02:00:55.070
I got a ton of miles or my man's a pilot,
you know,
and can jump on that plane.

1895
02:00:55.100 --> 02:00:57.340
It feels like this whole thing is just elementary.

1896
02:01:00.750 --> 02:01:01.690
<v 7>That's how he says the word.</v>

1897
02:01:01.790 --> 02:01:02.860
<v 11>You say that was it.</v>

1898
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:09.400
Alimentarius I said elementary,
elementary spent time in western New York.

1899
02:01:09.401 --> 02:01:11.500
You know we speak oddly,
right?

1900
02:01:11.501 --> 02:01:15.100
I mean you've talked to friends and he's trying to say elementary.
Elementary.

1901
02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:18.300
Yeah.
Elementary.
I can,
I said it wrong one time.

1902
02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:21.520
<v 7>That's not,
I say it son,</v>

1903
02:01:21.860 --> 02:01:25.460
<v 11>Bro.
You've been saying it wrong for 34 years that one time.</v>

1904
02:01:26.500 --> 02:01:29.540
Can you click it again?
Click any game?
That'd be so retarded.

1905
02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:35.770
Elementary,
yeah,
might be.
I don't think they see that.

1906
02:01:35.771 --> 02:01:38.300
I was just in Bali.
I wasn't,
not just but six months ago.

1907
02:01:38.301 --> 02:01:41.360
Then buffalo out the helium there.
They definitely don't say that.
Oh

1908
02:01:44.170 --> 02:01:48.230
now Josh has a special gift and all good from helion by the way.

1909
02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:52.880
We definitely,
we definitely,
let's,
let's try this tactic.

1910
02:01:52.881 --> 02:01:56.030
Be more direct route there already and you don't need to butter him up,

1911
02:01:56.210 --> 02:02:01.040
but also maybe take it down a notch.
I,
I,
I get a creepy vibe a little bit.

1912
02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:04.280
Yeah,
I know.
That's just,
I mean we haven't gotten to know each other.

1913
02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:08.910
Obviously a creepy vibe is what I put off.
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah.

1914
02:02:08.950 --> 02:02:12.140
I mean I get it.
You'll get to know me.
Hopefully sometime you'll,

1915
02:02:12.170 --> 02:02:16.070
you'll realize I'm not as creepy as I love.
That part's true.
Yeah,
that's true.

1916
02:02:17.190 --> 02:02:22.110
I totally get your first impressions.
Yeah,
there is.
Yeah.

1917
02:02:22.510 --> 02:02:27.410
The whole gas weaponize giggle.
Gushes yeah,
I think that's a winner still.

1918
02:02:27.411 --> 02:02:30.890
I really no,
nope.
That's not going to connect.
That's not,

1919
02:02:30.940 --> 02:02:35.460
that doesn't connect from it.
[inaudible]
it's another one.

1920
02:02:35.690 --> 02:02:37.790
Let's do some more cause I think that you need Brendan's,

1921
02:02:37.791 --> 02:02:42.350
I'm learning that my initial instincts of joy when I received tits in a DM or

1922
02:02:42.351 --> 02:02:45.860
something and going like,
Nido are awesome.
That's not good.
Right?
No.

1923
02:02:45.861 --> 02:02:49.700
Awesome is not sexy.
Right,
right,
right hand tastic no,
they don't want it.

1924
02:02:50.510 --> 02:02:51.760
You're not a fucking announcer.

1925
02:02:51.761 --> 02:02:56.660
Where the best met her tits without sounding like a nerd.
Uh,
you know,

1926
02:02:56.670 --> 02:02:59.570
it's easy because let's say you don't want to use words,

1927
02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:04.320
use emojis and all that.
The salivating mouth like,
oh,
here you go.

1928
02:03:04.321 --> 02:03:08.090
Or devil horns or the the heart eyes.
What about the,

1929
02:03:08.270 --> 02:03:13.130
or you can do or he can do the eggplant,
eggplant,
drip,
drip,

1930
02:03:13.131 --> 02:03:15.440
drip and then a mouth.
Yeah.

1931
02:03:16.350 --> 02:03:19.000
Yeah because call these are straight up.

1932
02:03:20.230 --> 02:03:24.830
Go speak their language.
Laugh lizards bro.
It's like hieroglyphics.
Shit.
Yeah,

1933
02:03:24.831 --> 02:03:28.910
but for the horse and if she,
if she leads with like a whole statement,

1934
02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:33.170
you can't treat her like,
like a treat her like you're a lady.

1935
02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:36.910
She wants you to treat it like a Ho she told you.
Right?
Right.

1936
02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:41.000
You don't want to send like a,
like you're my queen and be like,
oh no,

1937
02:03:43.570 --> 02:03:45.330
you don't say I'm your claim

1938
02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:48.980
noted Josh put it this way.

1939
02:03:49.070 --> 02:03:53.630
A lady like me that's got the husband and nice children,
like in a nice lady.

1940
02:03:53.631 --> 02:03:57.770
I would never send a DM like that in a million.
What's that?
Tickets are like,

1941
02:03:58.340 --> 02:04:00.470
Nah,
I'll suck your cock at any city.

1942
02:04:00.850 --> 02:04:04.260
I'll make you calm like it's never mama quality.

1943
02:04:05.140 --> 02:04:06.410
I got news for you,
Christina.

1944
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:08.570
There's a few married ladies that'll disagree with you.

1945
02:04:11.180 --> 02:04:15.580
Girls like that.
Sure.
Shitty by Shitty moms.
You know the shitty kid.

1946
02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:19.310
Your kid goes to the classes and the poor dude.

1947
02:04:20.330 --> 02:04:23.540
I'm saying the nice girls,
the good girls,
they don't.
That's what you say.

1948
02:04:23.541 --> 02:04:26.530
Nice things to
ease.

1949
02:04:27.050 --> 02:04:30.950
Are you trying to get a wife for you?
Try and get sucked off.
No wife.

1950
02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:34.490
Then we're sticking to the game plan.
Wait,
we had the whole thing about vet.

1951
02:04:34.491 --> 02:04:38.940
Can you come in a mouth?
No.
Also it's harder.
A vagina.
Dot.
Fuck Dude.

1952
02:04:39.090 --> 02:04:42.420
It's sad.
It's not code set.
Breading.
I know.
I know.
I know.

1953
02:04:42.421 --> 02:04:45.420
To be possible for you to understand your Dick.
Just imagine like,

1954
02:04:45.421 --> 02:04:48.510
I guess the way for you to realize like have you ever had like a month where

1955
02:04:48.511 --> 02:04:52.320
you're just like got so much pussy where you're just like your eyes rolling in

1956
02:04:52.321 --> 02:04:54.450
the back of your head and you're just,
you're not even,
you're like,

1957
02:04:54.451 --> 02:04:56.890
did I leave the oven on and you don't even think about sex anyway?

1958
02:04:56.940 --> 02:04:57.773
You know what I'm saying?

1959
02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:02.220
That's the only way that like maybe you can relate to me.
I'm this level.

1960
02:05:02.221 --> 02:05:02.751
You know what I mean?

1961
02:05:02.751 --> 02:05:06.300
Like it's just like Thursday and I have another pussy on my deck.

1962
02:05:06.301 --> 02:05:09.570
You know what I mean?
Like I just don't like those days.

1963
02:05:10.170 --> 02:05:14.880
But you just can't come at all.
Right.
Well he had a girl.

1964
02:05:14.970 --> 02:05:18.930
I can do it himself.
He just can't finish in the garage.
Yeah.

1965
02:05:18.931 --> 02:05:21.300
It's never been inside of them when he's got to get involved.

1966
02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:25.960
Have you ever had a girlfriend?
Yeah,
Todd Todd,
Todd.
Me Yet.

1967
02:05:27.030 --> 02:05:31.050
Don't say I don't know why I said that.
Don't say today

1968
02:05:33.110 --> 02:05:35.350
he played for the bills.
I'm nervous too.
God Damn it.

1969
02:05:35.940 --> 02:05:40.520
I did not play for the bills squad.
I,
yeah,
I'm,
yeah,

1970
02:05:40.521 --> 02:05:45.040
I plays make it.
Did you,
did you do preseason?
Yeah.
Dude,
that's fucking,

1971
02:05:45.140 --> 02:05:48.840
and then your mind training.
You got to set your standards higher man.

1972
02:05:49.120 --> 02:05:51.990
Not Jim Kelly over here.
Okay.
Okay.
More.
I liked coming.
This can we do,

1973
02:05:53.090 --> 02:05:55.920
he just taught you,
you realize that Emoji Shit.

1974
02:05:55.950 --> 02:06:00.950
That's some real knowledge that your phone game pregame as really d says free

1975
02:06:02.120 --> 02:06:05.670
game.
Right?
You should charge for this shit.
That was pretty awesome.

1976
02:06:05.700 --> 02:06:07.380
I'm definitely going to go with emojis.

1977
02:06:08.490 --> 02:06:13.490
Emojis are great because they're vague yet still kind of decipher ball and she

1978
02:06:13.591 --> 02:06:16.920
can read into that.
She had pretty black and white letter read into it though.

1979
02:06:16.921 --> 02:06:18.630
Is there any no,
no emojis.

1980
02:06:20.740 --> 02:06:23.240
Well you know what they all stand for,
right?
So he felt an egg plant.

1981
02:06:23.250 --> 02:06:26.340
That's a dick.
You have a peach that's the ass and then there's one,

1982
02:06:26.341 --> 02:06:30.120
there's the watermarks that's come.
The mouth is you're coming into their mouth

1983
02:06:33.110 --> 02:06:37.110
learning area.
Just trying to drink the full eclipse moon.

1984
02:06:37.111 --> 02:06:40.350
That's like a cuckold one,
right?
Why?
I'm not sure what that is like.
Yeah,

1985
02:06:40.351 --> 02:06:41.890
that's weird bro.
Hey,
what?

1986
02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:46.710
You know how we talk and then he's like,
yeah,
what about the moon?

1987
02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:51.900
He struggles with this finishing Chang.
What about if,
what have you got?
What?

1988
02:06:51.901 --> 02:06:53.100
A few to double team though.

1989
02:06:53.101 --> 02:06:56.490
When you kind of show him like front and center with the man that would be,

1990
02:06:56.491 --> 02:06:59.850
don't like show him the ropes he gives up to my left side.

1991
02:06:59.930 --> 02:07:04.870
I feel like you'd have a mask on jacking off in the corner.
Yeah.

1992
02:07:04.880 --> 02:07:07.110
I wouldn't really have to sing his whole face right now because he's covered.

1993
02:07:07.111 --> 02:07:12.111
But if you guys could like high five over the girl and I would be like,

1994
02:07:12.361 --> 02:07:14.670
wait a go bro.
Cause I would be like more like,

1995
02:07:14.970 --> 02:07:18.480
I'd be like congratulating you because I'm sure you'd do a better job than me.

1996
02:07:18.481 --> 02:07:21.420
I'd be like,
I'd be like,
get her dude.

1997
02:07:26.240 --> 02:07:29.650
You know what I'm saying?
You know if will Smith and Kevin Jamison and x rays

1998
02:07:31.210 --> 02:07:34.680
dude.
And then
then you would have,

1999
02:07:35.100 --> 02:07:37.020
you could do this thing where like you got like,

2000
02:07:37.340 --> 02:07:41.530
like Brendan would be a Banger and then your inner mountain and you go,
you know,

2001
02:07:41.531 --> 02:07:43.210
he played for the bills and she was like,
Hey,

2002
02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:48.750
I really like his neck so much bigger.
Right.

2003
02:07:51.880 --> 02:07:55.690
Yeah,
this is a good idea.
It's trying to help here,
man.
You know,

2004
02:07:55.810 --> 02:08:00.810
this has been very helpful.
I very much
hold on.
Do you have a type?

2005
02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:04.530
No,
but we do sweat.
Never kind of,

2006
02:08:04.560 --> 02:08:07.610
we do have this thing that we've been talking about where since he,

2007
02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:12.680
he hasn't been able to finish with a lady of any type.

2008
02:08:13.330 --> 02:08:16.650
We're thinking maybe because we were trying to figure out what the,
no,

2009
02:08:16.780 --> 02:08:20.350
I don't think he's gay.
Admit to that part.
I mean,
I'm opening up.

2010
02:08:21.910 --> 02:08:25.120
Maybe he just needs to be with like a smoke show,
like at 10.

2011
02:08:25.180 --> 02:08:27.540
You know what I mean?
You have to pay for that,
I think with him.
Oh,

2012
02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:31.600
let's get you a professional.
Is it that easy of a solution?

2013
02:08:31.601 --> 02:08:35.260
Who wants to start the Kickstarter fund?
I have one here.

2014
02:08:35.261 --> 02:08:38.740
I don't want to show the ladies nudes.
This is another,

2015
02:08:40.340 --> 02:08:43.750
I mean,
I've earned it,
man.
I've got some knowledge.

2016
02:08:43.930 --> 02:08:48.130
I would show you my mom's nudes for the bills.
You know what I mean?
Like,
so,

2017
02:08:49.170 --> 02:08:51.940
uh,
so this woman wrote,

2018
02:08:51.970 --> 02:08:56.140
I would absolutely love to be your calm sponsor.
I also never eat.

2019
02:08:56.170 --> 02:09:00.370
I chain smoke and nothing turns me on.
More than a good old child's murder.

2020
02:09:00.580 --> 02:09:05.110
Try it out.
And I was like,
okay.
I wrote I would be honored.
And then uh,

2021
02:09:05.650 --> 02:09:09.940
I ruined be honored.
What do you have the fourth grade teacher?
Did she say back?

2022
02:09:10.270 --> 02:09:14.620
She goes,
come to Ottawa on your come tour too far.
That's it.

2023
02:09:14.710 --> 02:09:19.030
And then she said,
uh,
come to like I said,
oh that sounds,

2024
02:09:19.420 --> 02:09:21.310
I said,
I'm super excited to come to Ottawa.

2025
02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:27.250
I'm trying to make myself look better.
Great coffee.

2026
02:09:29.470 --> 02:09:33.250
And she said,
I can't believe you are responding to me.
Lol.

2027
02:09:33.790 --> 02:09:35.740
I have to make this happen now.
And I was like,

2028
02:09:37.660 --> 02:09:41.350
then she sent nudes and are they good?
Yeah.
Well the fucking put them up dude.

2029
02:09:41.470 --> 02:09:45.110
I mean,
okay.
All right.
You can edit it out of the video.
Yeah,

2030
02:09:45.220 --> 02:09:48.610
you want the audience?
Are they good?
If they're,
if they're assholes shots.

2031
02:09:48.611 --> 02:09:51.130
I don't want to see it if that quote,
so I don't want to see that shit.

2032
02:09:51.340 --> 02:09:54.880
You were seeing her nudes?
No.
Oh God.
You guys need to start a soccer player.

2033
02:09:54.910 --> 02:09:59.230
Soccer player.
Her,
her nudes got leaked and they are so graphic.

2034
02:09:59.231 --> 02:10:03.280
She's opened up her ass asshole.
Really?
It's so disturbing guys.

2035
02:10:03.281 --> 02:10:06.490
You're not supposed to look,
but she's kind of like,
she's sexy,

2036
02:10:06.491 --> 02:10:09.610
but she's like the super aggressive goalie,
right?
Goalie.

2037
02:10:09.611 --> 02:10:13.920
Who got kicked out of the Olympics?
Yeah,
she's got to hardcore though.

2038
02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:17.500
She had asshole picks.
Should I bring them out to you?

2039
02:10:18.190 --> 02:10:21.040
Can we put them on the screen?
I mean,
they're in my phone.

2040
02:10:21.041 --> 02:10:23.940
I don't think that's possible.
I bet.
All right.
Yeah.

2041
02:10:26.310 --> 02:10:30.610
Let's see here.
Let me get a sexy pick and then the girl goes asshole,

2042
02:10:30.611 --> 02:10:34.070
like inside her asshole.
All right.
Maybe too much for me.
Yeah,
it does that.

2043
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:36.500
<v 13>Is that the line?
What's a sexy peg?
Oh,</v>

2044
02:10:36.501 --> 02:10:39.620
this is the girl who was trying to fuck you.
Yeah.
Was one of them.

2045
02:10:39.710 --> 02:10:42.560
That's one of them.
Came all on brother.
Oh,

2046
02:10:42.561 --> 02:10:47.020
look at that reaction game on Bro.
There's a video of,

2047
02:10:48.250 --> 02:10:51.710
oh,
she's kissing.
Oh,
and she has a strap on.
Wait,
what?
What?

2048
02:10:51.770 --> 02:10:56.090
What are you waiting for?
Oh,
what are you doing?
Get to Ottawa now.
What are you?

2049
02:10:56.091 --> 02:11:00.670
Don't listen to any my advice.
Let's see.
Let me see.
Don't you have miles?
Yeah.

2050
02:11:00.770 --> 02:11:04.400
What is wrong with you?
How much is a ticket to he opened for you,
Tom?

2051
02:11:05.420 --> 02:11:09.350
I'm looking.
Oh Dude.
Oh my God.

2052
02:11:09.351 --> 02:11:13.130
You need a cover on your phone.
You psycho swiped her.
All right.
Let's see.

2053
02:11:13.380 --> 02:11:17.120
All right.
Again,
I'm sure you're super nice,

2054
02:11:17.121 --> 02:11:19.700
but the iPhone one's a creepy vibe,
bro.

2055
02:11:20.690 --> 02:11:23.930
That old iPhone ones,
it moves up with creepy vibe.

2056
02:11:25.580 --> 02:11:26.980
What are you waiting for at?

2057
02:11:26.981 --> 02:11:30.320
This girl's going to make you take your phone before you start fucking dude.

2058
02:11:30.321 --> 02:11:34.040
Dude,
you're crazy.
You got to go to auto zone.
Got at all.
No,
those are good.

2059
02:11:34.130 --> 02:11:38.510
She'll make you come.
Yeah.
Geez.
Yeah.
She has a beak on her though.

2060
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:43.650
Yeah.
Well No,
it's all right to go down.
Um,

2061
02:11:43.790 --> 02:11:45.260
she's smart not to show her face.

2062
02:11:45.261 --> 02:11:49.280
So I mean like from a sending naked pictures perspective,
right?

2063
02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:52.250
I mean it's pretty incriminating.
Yeah.
Do you care?
Do you send you a text,

2064
02:11:52.260 --> 02:11:55.790
by the way?
Do you know?
Do you know what Potter's a intro is?

2065
02:11:55.791 --> 02:11:59.420
When we have him on the show to do a segment?
What is it?
It's this right here.

2066
02:12:05.480 --> 02:12:08.930
Zeb Him cried.
I thought that was him crying.
That's how we,

2067
02:12:09.410 --> 02:12:11.800
that's how we bring them on usually.
That's nice.
Yeah.

2068
02:12:12.650 --> 02:12:13.850
How long have you guys known each other?

2069
02:12:14.090 --> 02:12:18.110
I've known him for a number of years now.
Yeah.
We call him the cockroach.
Yeah.

2070
02:12:18.111 --> 02:12:21.260
Why he doesn't eat,
he doesn't sleep.
He can't come.

2071
02:12:22.010 --> 02:12:24.980
How old is cause he's not even a human.
He's a he's 19.

2072
02:12:27.210 --> 02:12:32.060
I am 33 33.
Yeah.
Yeah,
it doesn't sleep.
Oh Wow.

2073
02:12:32.470 --> 02:12:36.860
Wow.
Yeah.
Um,
hey,
I wanted to bring up the other thing,
uh,

2074
02:12:36.980 --> 02:12:40.190
native,
so yeah.
Yeah.
So,

2075
02:12:41.870 --> 02:12:45.830
so,
so for people that um,
don't know,
I had it,

2076
02:12:45.860 --> 02:12:49.280
we got a real big kick out of this and that was that.
Um,

2077
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:54.320
a few months ago you tweeted out a picture of my barber.

2078
02:12:54.350 --> 02:12:58.760
Yes.
And you said you're here with Tom's twin dude.

2079
02:12:58.940 --> 02:13:01.460
Every time I see him I go,
you look like my friends say,
girl,

2080
02:13:01.461 --> 02:13:02.510
you looked at my friends,
the girl.

2081
02:13:02.750 --> 02:13:06.620
I thought you guys look identical now before you go bad on him.
You Ready?
Yeah.

2082
02:13:07.220 --> 02:13:11.660
So I think he passed away.
What I want to go get my haircut,
uh,
last week.

2083
02:13:11.990 --> 02:13:15.730
And there was like a huge picture up of him and they're like,
uh,

2084
02:13:15.770 --> 02:13:19.790
he had a heart attack and he's on life support and we're doing a go fund me.

2085
02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:22.940
And I was like,
I can blend.
I know before we go bad on him.

2086
02:13:23.210 --> 02:13:26.180
I wasn't gonna look bad on him.
I was just thinking,
you look anything like that.

2087
02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:30.250
I mean,
mine.
No,
I think he looks like he's out,
dude.
No,

2088
02:13:30.260 --> 02:13:33.090
he's Mexican is all right.
Well that's,
you know,
but yeah,

2089
02:13:33.091 --> 02:13:35.910
he had a heart attack and then there's the idea of some say that he wasn't doing

2090
02:13:35.911 --> 02:13:39.700
well,
they had a go fund me,
you know who's going to cut your hair now?

2091
02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:43.890
That's the real problem.
What does the caption say there?
What does it say?

2092
02:13:43.920 --> 02:13:47.910
Fun Fact.
Did you know my barber's Thompson grows Mexican brother?
Yeah.

2093
02:13:48.330 --> 02:13:52.260
So is that a bad thing?
Not at all.
No.
I just,
I thought he was like,

2094
02:13:52.261 --> 02:13:56.100
I got a laugh out of it and it goes my mind.
I was just a mean,

2095
02:13:56.101 --> 02:14:00.570
would you say has a joke up?
I felt like mine was more fun.

2096
02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:02.100
Years was fun.
And yours just like,

2097
02:14:02.340 --> 02:14:06.300
apparently Brent's been punched in the face so many times that recognize his

2098
02:14:06.301 --> 02:14:10.690
friends.
Yeah,
but which was a,
it was,
people laughed.
It was a fun,

2099
02:14:11.090 --> 02:14:14.070
I did it in jest.
I just thought maybe,
you know,

2100
02:14:14.071 --> 02:14:17.940
the CTE was making you not see my face dude.

2101
02:14:17.970 --> 02:14:19.640
He got up similar features.

2102
02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:24.760
Remind you my wife's not at all that the only similarity is the beard and even

2103
02:14:25.261 --> 02:14:29.760
that man's beard is so full and have the same eyes.
Absolutely not.
No this,
this,

2104
02:14:29.820 --> 02:14:31.070
this is nowhere near town.

2105
02:14:31.071 --> 02:14:34.170
It was apparently early in the morning cause I looked like death in that
picture.

2106
02:14:35.410 --> 02:14:40.290
You look handsome.
This hand,
the other gentleman's handsome,
but no,
but it got us,

2107
02:14:40.380 --> 02:14:42.420
I got our wheels turning.
Oh yeah.
How so?

2108
02:14:42.510 --> 02:14:47.190
Well we decided that we should pull out some of your twins.

2109
02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:52.050
What I look like.
Yeah.
So here's this guy you think.

2110
02:14:52.750 --> 02:14:56.550
I don't know.
See it at all that more like Morgan Freeman.
Then that guy,

2111
02:14:58.330 --> 02:14:59.230
that's terrible.

2112
02:14:59.231 --> 02:15:03.600
It's Vinny from Jersey shore did eat all the pizza and Jersey shore.

2113
02:15:03.601 --> 02:15:05.970
What happened?
You don't think you look like him at all?

2114
02:15:07.090 --> 02:15:11.670
Not even a little bit like facially,
a little bit and I don't know man.

2115
02:15:11.671 --> 02:15:13.410
I don't think so.
He's got tattoos.

2116
02:15:17.370 --> 02:15:20.190
I mean that's the thing.
Why do you post that picture?

2117
02:15:20.470 --> 02:15:24.630
A ketogenetic diet now and he's much skinnier before and after.

2118
02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:29.640
She says he's very,
he's really in good shape right now.
I guess.

2119
02:15:29.641 --> 02:15:33.090
Maybe I'll see you at all in that.

2120
02:15:34.530 --> 02:15:38.280
I mean,
not really,
man.
I guess we both have eyes and a nose.
All right.
All right.

2121
02:15:38.281 --> 02:15:41.910
All right.
And we're both white.
This one.
This next one.

2122
02:15:42.170 --> 02:15:46.290
That's all right bro.
You and I had a baby.

2123
02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:51.390
You don't think your hair and it looks like him.
My hair does,

2124
02:15:52.050 --> 02:15:55.680
but that's about it.
He looks more like you than me to eat.
Well,

2125
02:15:55.681 --> 02:15:59.370
he has your stare,
right?
Your pregame,

2126
02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:01.920
you're pre-fight stare across the ring.

2127
02:16:02.780 --> 02:16:07.320
The very full face.
Very similar.
God,
I don't see it there either.

2128
02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:11.250
I don't see it.
What else do you guys see?
You [inaudible] this right here.

2129
02:16:11.370 --> 02:16:13.680
Brow Rob Kardashian.
You don't see,

2130
02:16:13.740 --> 02:16:17.820
I guess if I all the fucking honey in the world.
What are you talking about?

2131
02:16:18.780 --> 02:16:23.150
It looks just like you.
That looks like you.
You don't see them.
You don't know.

2132
02:16:24.150 --> 02:16:28.590
I'm on this crazy diet now where I do no sugar,
no carbs.
Yeah.
For a while.

2133
02:16:28.930 --> 02:16:31.870
Ever since,
and you're,
you're right.
You're right.

2134
02:16:31.871 --> 02:16:36.460
When when he said a fat shaming works because the Tommy store keeps using this

2135
02:16:36.461 --> 02:16:40.980
picture of how things was so fast.
I said,
hey,
it looks like bird,

2136
02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:43.960
like I think you sent it to me.
He said,
on the comedy thing,
I was like,

2137
02:16:43.961 --> 02:16:47.610
oh my and my face looks like that and then since then I've been really,

2138
02:16:48.130 --> 02:16:51.640
I've been on [inaudible] now.
He was just here last week.
No,

2139
02:16:52.030 --> 02:16:54.670
he's back up getting fat.
Why?

2140
02:16:54.830 --> 02:16:57.340
Because he's on tour and he's just like Terrence himself.
Liz.

2141
02:16:57.550 --> 02:17:01.720
That's burnt though.
Bert skinning.
Would it be fun?
That's true.
Yeah.
No.

2142
02:17:01.721 --> 02:17:06.160
You need them to be like,
yeah,
it's birth three 2120 he's up.
He's up to,

2143
02:17:06.161 --> 02:17:10.900
like he said,
he was just at just under three,
right?
No Way.
Yeah.

2144
02:17:10.990 --> 02:17:15.510
Yeah.
What?
Yeah.
I huge man.
God Damn,

you're bullshitting.

2145
02:17:15.530 --> 02:17:16.900
No hurts.

2146
02:17:16.901 --> 02:17:21.210
385 I'll show you a picture of Christ where we were just with him.
Wow.

2147
02:17:21.970 --> 02:17:25.120
How about this?
Does this look like you?
Oh man,

2148
02:17:25.121 --> 02:17:29.300
that that's your company store picture.
That's got me started.

2149
02:17:29.620 --> 02:17:32.050
And why does it keep using it?
I don't know.

2150
02:17:32.720 --> 02:17:36.570
They just pull whatever they can get I guess or the laugh track that keeps using

2151
02:17:36.580 --> 02:17:40.030
this one to mean a fucking turtleneck shirt.
This is last week.

2152
02:17:43.450 --> 02:17:46.210
I mean he's thick for sure,
but see it's not,
there's no way.

2153
02:17:46.211 --> 02:17:48.010
He's two 90 [inaudible] Instagram.

2154
02:17:48.011 --> 02:17:52.930
If you guys want to see put that picture doesn't really even show.

2155
02:17:53.830 --> 02:17:54.663
Yeah,

2156
02:17:54.730 --> 02:17:59.440
it's definitely not to need a profile pic to see how tall is he visit from your

2157
02:17:59.441 --> 02:18:02.110
buffalo bills this on the practice squad and it's probably less me doing work

2158
02:18:02.111 --> 02:18:05.980
there that's fucking chat about and isn't there.

2159
02:18:05.981 --> 02:18:07.210
We have a picture of him on the phone.

2160
02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:11.910
There's a picture of you that we got on the phone.
I don't want to pay.

2161
02:18:15.180 --> 02:18:17.920
It's the star from born this way.
How about the uh,

2162
02:18:18.100 --> 02:18:20.500
how about Oh finger.

2163
02:18:20.910 --> 02:18:24.880
Then what about your octagon picture there?
I went out.

2164
02:18:25.210 --> 02:18:27.880
I was at this fight.
I was,
this is the mitre on fight.
Oh,

2165
02:18:27.950 --> 02:18:30.390
I don't want to fire this.
This was what you did on this,

2166
02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:33.400
didn't you fight Mitro uh,
I don't know what you're talking about.

2167
02:18:33.490 --> 02:18:36.600
I don't want to know this.
I want nothing to do with

2168
02:18:38.330 --> 02:18:41.000
what's going through your mind right here.
I don't want it on there.

2169
02:18:43.450 --> 02:18:48.310
I slept in the back.
Sorry.
What were you saying Tom?

2170
02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:50.060
You look how to 80.

2171
02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:55.350
You look heavier in this picture.
You know he won this fight.
Is that right?
Yeah.

2172
02:18:55.990 --> 02:18:59.170
Yup.
Did you make out with any of the rat the cage rats?

2173
02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:03.790
I don't know what that is.
If that's not you,
that's your twin,

2174
02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:10.160
I guess,
Bro.
Cool.
Yeah.

I just saw it.
I saw you.
Yeah.

2177
02:19:18.820 --> 02:19:21.910
I didn't see anything else hill.
That terrible story about that Barbara though.

2178
02:19:21.940 --> 02:19:25.570
Yeah,

That's terrible.
And you were seeing that guy for a long time week?
Yeah.

2179
02:19:25.660 --> 02:19:29.560
For long stuff.
You still go to the same place?
What happened?
I moved though.

2180
02:19:29.561 --> 02:19:31.490
I haven't been there since.
That's too far right now.

2181
02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:34.910
I gotta find one around here.
Yeah.
Alright.
You know what good one.

2182
02:19:37.500 --> 02:19:42.200
If you like what I got going on or you do it yourself or really you pay someone?

2183
02:19:42.290 --> 02:19:47.000
I paid for one.
Yeah.
Well when he does it himself,
he can miss I fuck up.
Yeah.

2184
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:51.940
And then you go like,
what am I doing?
Saving 30 bucks.
$30 come on.
I know.

2185
02:19:52.130 --> 02:19:56.210
Spend that on coffee.
Come on.
Yeah,
I'm growing my shit out like Bradley Cooper.

2186
02:19:56.240 --> 02:19:57.950
So wait,
you do look thinned out though.

2187
02:19:57.980 --> 02:20:01.190
How long have you been doing this for days now.
Four days.
That's it.

2188
02:20:01.220 --> 02:20:03.680
Four days of super strict.
When we are moving,

2189
02:20:03.690 --> 02:20:06.820
it's hard for me to stick to my diet and work out.
Cool.

2190
02:20:07.370 --> 02:20:09.950
Are you going to have a cutoff point or he's trying to get like super,

2191
02:20:09.951 --> 02:20:12.350
super trying to get healthy.
I think you're going to be a really lean,

2192
02:20:12.351 --> 02:20:13.940
better leaner for sure.

2193
02:20:13.970 --> 02:20:18.050
I don't want my face to look like I fucking got stung by all the bs.

2194
02:20:18.110 --> 02:20:22.170
And that's your thing,
right?
Aren't you the Bee Guy?
Well The pee guy,

2195

2196
02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:28.610

That's what I'm saying.

2197
02:20:29.010 --> 02:20:31.670
Yes.
But that's all right.
But you don't like it.

2198
02:20:32.030 --> 02:20:34.790
It's got the name of your podcast king in the sting.

2199
02:20:35.150 --> 02:20:37.010
I thought it was the thing in the ring.
No,

2200
02:20:37.011 --> 02:20:39.350
it's the king and the sting and then there's the fight and the kid.

2201
02:20:39.351 --> 02:20:42.350
But I don't fight anymore.
But that you stick with it.
You know what I'm saying?

2202
02:20:42.380 --> 02:20:46.300
So you're the,
you're the sting on the,
on the yes thing.
You're the states,

2203
02:20:46.320 --> 02:20:50.290

So feel,

He's like,

2210
02:21:08.151 --> 02:21:12.490

I think that from a road rules alarm.

2211
02:21:12.491 --> 02:21:15.220
Are you kidding?

I've noticed that you have a nice piece of jewelry.

2240
02:22:56.800 --> 02:23:00.900
My husband wants me to buy him a chain for his 40th birthday.
He had a chain.

2241
02:23:00.950 --> 02:23:04.740
It's like a dope with a Cuban link route.
Are you being serious?
Yeah.
Yeah.

2242
02:23:05.010 --> 02:23:09.330
What about some black?
Oh

2243
02:23:09.510 --> 02:23:14.130
Oh my God.
This is perfect.
When did you get it?
Uh,

2244
02:23:14.131 --> 02:23:19.080
I got it when I shot my special.
Gave it to,
yeah.

2245
02:23:19.980 --> 02:23:24.960
Who gave it to you?
This guy.
His name's chase chase Gregory.
He does all the,

2246
02:23:25.410 --> 02:23:28.560
the Dodgers.
Come on man.

2247
02:23:29.010 --> 02:23:32.580
I bought this piece from this Hans,
uh,
uh,
and then uh,

2248
02:23:32.581 --> 02:23:34.140
I was a camp or he talked to me.
He goes,

2249
02:23:34.141 --> 02:23:35.760
why aren't you getting ready to shoot your special ed?
Yeah.

2250
02:23:35.970 --> 02:23:38.970
It was like got some free and then drop that off.
Wait,

2251
02:23:39.110 --> 02:23:43.590

You'd bought things for him before?
Yeah.
Yeah.

2252
02:23:43.620 --> 02:23:47.120
I brought my girls running from him.
Oh,

That's really good.
Awesome.

2253
02:23:47.130 --> 02:23:51.120
Manifold chain.
It's still looks dope.
It looks real nice.

2254
02:23:51.121 --> 02:23:54.240
I'm trying to convince her time is maybe if he got off of her free.

2255
02:23:54.241 --> 02:23:56.580
I don't want to spend like 50 grand on a chain.

2256
02:23:56.610 --> 02:23:58.860
I think that's how it's like spend 40.

2257
02:23:59.450 --> 02:24:04.450
What's your like get 44 44,000 for every year.

Let me see it first.

2261

he's living my dream.
You can't let me go with dream.

2263
02:24:27.731 --> 02:24:32.400
It's up the chain smells like Brandon smell.
It sounds like your Cologne dude.

2264
02:24:32.450 --> 02:24:33.690
Yeah,

2265

2266
02:24:38.970 --> 02:24:43.040
kind of a good luck charm.
My son had his seizures.
I've got that like this.

2267
02:24:43.110 --> 02:24:46.110
The day when we figured out CBD oil gets rid of them.

2268
02:24:46.140 --> 02:24:50.420
So I haven't taken it off since he was not anymore.
Thanks to CBD oil.
Really?

2269
02:24:50.520 --> 02:24:54.180
What was wrong?
Real Story.
What was causing it?
Um,
they don't know.

2270
02:24:54.181 --> 02:24:58.080
It's epileptic seizures,
but the nine though,
and then,
uh,

2271
02:24:58.810 --> 02:25:01.980
there's like all like doctors like,
oh,
let's put him on some medication.

2272
02:25:01.981 --> 02:25:04.290
Let's do this,
let's do this.
And then,
uh,

2273
02:25:04.291 --> 02:25:07.380
I wonder these forums and the mom's like,
do not give a medication.

2274
02:25:07.381 --> 02:25:10.530
It fucks up everything you're doing.
Try CBD oil.

2275
02:25:10.590 --> 02:25:14.280
And I have some friends who know some people in CBD oil business,
so I'm like,

2276
02:25:14.281 --> 02:25:16.560
I'm going to try that before I try anything else?
Tried it.

2277
02:25:16.561 --> 02:25:18.530
Hasn't had one since dude.

2278
02:25:18.690 --> 02:25:22.620
And I got that chain when we figured out that the CBD oil,
I'll fix it.
So hello,

2279
02:25:22.860 --> 02:25:27.370
how are you feeling right now?
Look,
look.
No,
it looks,
I like the hand.
Hamsa,

2280
02:25:27.371 --> 02:25:30.290
is that what you call that?
A hand?
I like that wards off evil spirits.
Yeah,

2281
02:25:30.490 --> 02:25:34.690

Yeah,

2282
02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:36.940
I like that.
Black diamonds.

2283
02:25:37.180 --> 02:25:40.420
I like the gold more than the black diamonds on you because you wear so much

2284
02:25:40.421 --> 02:25:43.120
black already.
I think the gold pops

2285
02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:47.770
up with the guy who come to your house.
Okay,
dude,
get your deal.

2286
02:25:47.800 --> 02:25:50.440
You reach out to her,
look at her,
shaking her head.

2287
02:25:51.140 --> 02:25:55.330
All I asked for all I look at him,
he looks dope.

2288
02:25:55.450 --> 02:25:59.570
All I want for my birthday is this and for you not to ruin my day,
you know.

2289
02:25:59.770 --> 02:26:03.850
Oh my God.

2290
02:26:03.851 --> 02:26:07.360

And she was like,

2294
02:26:18.700 --> 02:26:22.750

Um,

And I was like,

2295
02:26:22.751 --> 02:26:26.410
I'm trying to have fun there.
But the way he phrased it,
he was like,

2296
02:26:26.411 --> 02:26:30.940
my friends and I are just going to the trial.
Well,
I didn't say it like that.

2297
02:26:30.941 --> 02:26:35.320
Like,
oh,

I was like,
well then can I can do some with you after like,

2298

<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

2311
02:27:36.320 --> 02:27:41.320
<v 15>Did this guy slide in your [inaudible]?</v>

2312
02:27:44.850 --> 02:27:46.530

Can you just drive what's happening?

2313
02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:53.440
He's button a dude with his dick out.
Yeah.
Size.

2314
02:27:54.050 --> 02:27:59.050
That's a small to medium size day and that's small and how to shape and he's

2315
02:27:59.691 --> 02:28:04.260
dancing.
He's not doing,
we think of as a

2316
02:28:06.040 --> 02:28:06.873
real stiff.

2317
02:28:09.030 --> 02:28:12.540
It looks like yellow badges and Sin City is

2318
02:28:12.540 --> 02:28:14.940
<v 13>it?
His dog is swinging around as he's dancing.</v>

02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:21.980
Oh Wow.

2320
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:24.290
<v 15>think so?
He just DM me.</v>

2321
02:28:24.291 --> 02:28:29.291
Actually the guys just sitting around the world with that shaking cockatiel but

2322
02:28:30.831 --> 02:28:35.350
do you think he's an older man is,
oh
no,

2323
02:28:37.070 --> 02:28:41.120
I don't like the clothes that don't dance in spite of her song.
You old fuck.

2324
02:28:41.390 --> 02:28:44.960
Oh whoa.
And then its debts is only,
that's his go to.
When he runs out,

2325
02:28:44.961 --> 02:28:48.950
ideas goes to pluck it,
shake the
shake the,

2326
02:28:51.650 --> 02:28:52.590
you got it backwards.

2327
02:28:58.670 --> 02:29:01.210
I start

2328
02:29:07.030 --> 02:29:09.940
trim the hair back.
A slideshow or

2329
02:29:09.950 --> 02:29:13.070
<v 13>you don't just get the Jack in the,
it's kind of still flowing.
Yeah.</v>

2330
02:29:13.100 --> 02:29:16.250
That's what happened there.
There's some fluff in that for sure.
God is,

2331
02:29:16.251 --> 02:29:18.240
he gave it all to melting.

2332
02:29:18.920 --> 02:29:23.060
No naked Armadillo.
Original cool guy.

2333
02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:26.260
That's the president CEO out there.

2334
02:29:27.560 --> 02:29:31.730
That's not a cool man.
I'm really digging this jewelry.
You look fresh,
dude.
Yeah.

2335
02:29:31.940 --> 02:29:34.760
This is how you walk around all day or does she highlight want to go on stage?

2336
02:29:35.230 --> 02:29:39.410
It was a distraction.
That makes sense though,
but now when you shoot the special,

2337
02:29:41.170 --> 02:29:44.540
I just had the one out for the special black one.
No,

2338
02:29:44.541 --> 02:29:48.650
I had the gold one out cause for my son.
This is cool.
This dude gave you this.

2339
02:29:48.770 --> 02:29:52.160
Yeah,
man.
That's pretty crazy.

2340
02:29:53.050 --> 02:29:56.360
Did you have to do anything,
you know,
little Robert Kraft Shit.

2341
02:29:59.690 --> 02:30:01.850
What's up dog?
How bad you want that chain.

2342
02:30:02.090 --> 02:30:05.920
You want that thick like Rick Ross chain we've talked about.
Um,

2343
02:30:06.140 --> 02:30:09.280
I mean I'm down for any of it.
You know,
God.
He's like,
hey,
it's a,

2344
02:30:09.390 --> 02:30:13.870
it's birthday rings.
Do you do ring?
I don't do rings.
I remember the same.

2345
02:30:14.510 --> 02:30:17.810
No watches.
Watches,
necklaces.
That's the way to go.

2346
02:30:19.060 --> 02:30:23.180
No hard pass on the air.
It's kind of girly.
Do you know anyone?

2347
02:30:23.470 --> 02:30:27.140
Any dude with an airing?
Black guys can do it.
Wow.
You're right.
That's true.

2348
02:30:27.470 --> 02:30:29.370
They pull it off.
Well,
you have to like,

2349
02:30:29.660 --> 02:30:32.930
you've got that real BDE you're talking about,
you know that big Dick Energy.

2350
02:30:32.960 --> 02:30:37.460
Yeah.
Big Dude Energy.
Yeah,
Bro.
What about your girl?

2351
02:30:37.461 --> 02:30:41.540
She ended jewelry.
He had a little bit.
And Jews,
the Jews,

2352
02:30:41.590 --> 02:30:44.930
Jew or you're not are,
you know,
not really.
I'm not into anything.

2353
02:30:44.931 --> 02:30:49.340
I don't really terrible.
I'm the worst person to,

2354
02:30:49.430 --> 02:30:52.430
I don't care every,
anything he buys me,
I'm excited about.
I'm just not.

2355
02:30:52.520 --> 02:30:57.200
Did you get her that dope?
A fanny pack?
Is that a Gucci Fabulous things?

2356
02:30:57.220 --> 02:31:01.520
Dope big thing.
Yeah.
That was cool,
but you're not into shoes,
purses,

2357
02:31:02.060 --> 02:31:05.300
jewelry.
You know what I like what I was talking about this before.

2358
02:31:05.301 --> 02:31:09.200
I get excited going to the grocery store and just buying whatever I want.

2359
02:31:09.230 --> 02:31:09.531
You don't want,

2360
02:31:09.531 --> 02:31:14.360
I feel mostly like a baller is when my fridge is stocked with Diet Cokes.

2361
02:31:14.980 --> 02:31:16.880
I think it's a kid thing.
When I was a kid,

2362
02:31:16.881 --> 02:31:21.150
when my mom would go grocery shopping and there would be filled with all of our

2363
02:31:21.151 --> 02:31:24.580
favorite foods,
I'd open up,
be like,
that's right.
Yeah.
I feel good.

2364
02:31:24.581 --> 02:31:27.840
It's going to be a good week and I think for whatever reason it triggers that

2365
02:31:27.850 --> 02:31:29.370
man drinking diet cokes.
Yeah,

2366
02:31:29.440 --> 02:31:32.790
open it up and there's just a 24 pack and I'm just like,
fuck yeah,

2367
02:31:32.791 --> 02:31:37.791
I'm doing a stocked beverage fridge feels good to you if you have a variety of

2368
02:31:38.191 --> 02:31:42.630
that,
bro.
You drink diet drinks.
I used to drink them a lot.

2369
02:31:42.690 --> 02:31:47.530
I drink that Zevs via stuff a lot.
Yeah,
I fucked it was even.
Yeah.
Um,
but I,

2370
02:31:47.560 --> 02:31:52.000
I,
I do have a soft spot for,
especially if it's,
you know,

2371
02:31:52.500 --> 02:31:57.500
weeks or something have gone by and then somebody like offers a diet coke that,

2372
02:31:57.571 --> 02:32:00.610
but I don't buy it for the house.
Really?
Yeah,
just stopped.
Cause I'll,

2373
02:32:00.611 --> 02:32:05.400
I'll go through like,
it's almost like,
um,
I don't know if I'm home.

2374
02:32:05.410 --> 02:32:08.670
I want something like a drink.
A beverage.
Yeah.
So I'll go through like five,

2375
02:32:08.671 --> 02:32:13.560
six a day.
Really.
If I'm at home,
I'd like to stick to just for the most part,

2376
02:32:13.561 --> 02:32:18.110
water and coffee.
That's the plane,
Bro.
I know,
but I do like that as coffee.

2377
02:32:18.530 --> 02:32:21.250
Me Too.
Yeah.
Do you drink a lot of water?

2378
02:32:21.280 --> 02:32:25.230
I never drink water ever at that fucking athlete.

2379
02:32:25.980 --> 02:32:28.020
I'm not an athlete anymore,
but I mean when you were in,

2380
02:32:28.050 --> 02:32:30.560
it's up for anything though.
It's also a myth.
So if you drink lights,

2381
02:32:30.660 --> 02:32:34.650
eight cups of coffee,
that still counts as fluids.
It's a diuretic.

2382
02:32:34.680 --> 02:32:37.920
It's still a fluid.
It's a diuretic,
which means it's dehydrating.

2383
02:32:37.921 --> 02:32:39.970
You pushing it through,
but it's still liquid.

2384
02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:43.030
It's going to get kidney stones and stuff.
That part feel great right now.

2385
02:32:43.260 --> 02:32:45.900
Although I was getting pretty sick from drinking so much coffee.

2386
02:32:45.901 --> 02:32:48.780
So throwing up and stuff on sets.
Yeah.
Yup.

2387
02:32:49.870 --> 02:32:53.470
What did the doc alarm,
your body's just so acidic from all the coffee,
you know?

2388
02:32:53.471 --> 02:32:57.720
Seriously?
Yeah.
Stone up in Uber set is bad.
How much were you,

2389
02:32:57.721 --> 02:33:01.360
were you drinking like 1618 cups a day?
Why?

2390
02:33:02.040 --> 02:33:05.250
There was no part before the throwing up.
It told you that maybe that's too much.

2391
02:33:05.280 --> 02:33:09.240
It felt great bro.
Really?
Yeah.
Too many jobs.
And I was like a Coffee Cup.

2392
02:33:09.270 --> 02:33:12.540
How many jobs do we have right now?
Because this always fascinates me about you.

2393
02:33:12.890 --> 02:33:17.350
Well,
you have a great work ethic,
but I mean,
break it down,
break it down.

2394
02:33:17.650 --> 02:33:21.940
Well there's,
so my showtime stuff would blow the belt,
right?

2395
02:33:21.970 --> 02:33:24.760
So I do that.
And that's a days,
that's why that's a,

2396
02:33:24.761 --> 02:33:28.130
that's a Monday cover fights while that it's like a,

2397
02:33:28.330 --> 02:33:31.390
it's a fight show light,
like the beginning,
just my life.

2398
02:33:31.391 --> 02:33:34.150
And then I break down fights and inside information and stuff like that.

2399
02:33:34.330 --> 02:33:36.350
So that's Mondays.
That's right.
Yeah.

2400
02:33:36.380 --> 02:33:40.720
So I go from there and I shoot it in the kid with Brian Cowen on Monday.

2401
02:33:40.750 --> 02:33:43.960
On Monday.
This is every Monday.
Every Monday.

2402
02:33:44.500 --> 02:33:48.580
And then Tuesday I shoot more stuff for showtime below the belt,

2403
02:33:48.670 --> 02:33:52.690
which it might be a food truck diary show where it's me and a fighter and we're

2404
02:33:52.691 --> 02:33:55.480
at a food truck doing an interview at the food trucks and that's one.

2405
02:33:55.480 --> 02:33:59.410
The second is we do,
and I do king in the sting with Theo and that's Tuesdays.

2406
02:33:59.470 --> 02:34:02.980
Okay.
And then usually I always have standup Tuesday nights at least two sets.

2407
02:34:04.060 --> 02:34:05.970
Yup.
We're in a three tonight.
Where are you doing?

2408
02:34:06.340 --> 02:34:09.940
Comedy store and the Improv.
Wow.

2409
02:34:10.210 --> 02:34:13.420
So then Wednesdays I find in the kid,
when did you have a guest?

2410
02:34:14.170 --> 02:34:19.170
And then Thursdays I usually have another something for showtime and then stand

2411
02:34:19.301 --> 02:34:20.134
up at night.

2412
02:34:20.830 --> 02:34:25.600
Fridays I'm usually on the road or to stand up here in la.

2413
02:34:26.050 --> 02:34:29.920
Wow.
Hustling.
Really doing a lot of work though.

2414
02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:32.980
But I mean still it's not that crazy.

2415
02:34:33.010 --> 02:34:35.800
I think you just have a lot of different things going on too.

2416
02:34:35.890 --> 02:34:39.910
That's what makes it fun.
I get mad.
Do find the kid or the blind.

2417
02:34:40.800 --> 02:34:43.870
I die.
I hate that.
I get my captain.
The different,

2418
02:34:44.120 --> 02:34:45.530
how much are you road dog in it right now?

2419
02:34:46.150 --> 02:34:48.790
I was off the road because I shot my special in January,

2420
02:34:48.791 --> 02:34:51.880
so I get back on the road of March.
Wow.

2421
02:34:54.210 --> 02:34:56.620
Good.
Really good.
San Diego.
Yeah.
Really,
really good.

2422
02:34:56.650 --> 02:35:00.640
Spreckels theater in San Diego.
San Diego's a good town.
Does it have a home?

2423
02:35:00.800 --> 02:35:05.620
Showtime drops in May.
Congrats.
Thank you.
Have a name for it yet.

2424
02:35:05.700 --> 02:35:10.420
Uh,
you'd be surprised.
Yeah.
That's a good name for it.
Yeah.
Was going to be fun,

2425
02:35:10.421 --> 02:35:14.890
man.
That's awesome.
Back on the road.
Yeah.
That's exciting.

2426
02:35:15.070 --> 02:35:18.040
Pretty exciting.
You got to rack up those road dollars,
right?
Yeah.

2427
02:35:18.190 --> 02:35:20.200
I feel like we've lost all energy in our bodies.

2428
02:35:20.290 --> 02:35:24.830
Do you know where you know where you go first?
Ah,

2429
02:35:24.831 --> 02:35:29.610
I'm going to Miami.
The Miami Improv.
They redid it.
That's right.
They did.

2430
02:35:29.630 --> 02:35:31.660
Everyone warns me about it.
Have you been there?
You know,

2431
02:35:31.661 --> 02:35:35.430
but now it's more inwards in drought or uh,
I dunno,
but I didn't,

2432
02:35:35.440 --> 02:35:38.750
Rogan warned me about it.
Yeah,
but that was the old,

2433
02:35:39.450 --> 02:35:44.260
the old ones in coconut grove.
[inaudible]
be great.
I thought I know the old one.

2434
02:35:44.261 --> 02:35:46.840
No,
the new one's going to be good.
The new one's supposed to be good.

2435
02:35:46.900 --> 02:35:50.530
So I go there DC or I'm sorry,
Miami Improv.
And then uh,

2436
02:35:50.531 --> 02:35:54.780
we just did a Milwaukee we had in Milwaukee for this,

2437
02:35:54.880 --> 02:35:58.630
I think it's the third week in March.
PAPP's theater.

2438
02:35:59.020 --> 02:36:02.980
I've done walkie best theater.
Yeah,
it's great.
Is it awesome?
I've never done it.

2439
02:36:03.070 --> 02:36:05.560
It's hard to get worried about going to new markets.
It's great.

2440
02:36:05.590 --> 02:36:10.540
But then it's also the best green room in the business.
Really?
Yes.

2441
02:36:11.020 --> 02:36:14.290
So you can better than comedy works in Denver.
You can't compare,

2442
02:36:14.530 --> 02:36:16.210
you can't compare it because this is a theater.

2443
02:36:16.570 --> 02:36:21.570
So you walk in and there'll be like a Barista set up at a stand and that you're

2444
02:36:23.021 --> 02:36:25.450
in the greenery.
Like who's this for?
That goes for you.

2445
02:36:26.560 --> 02:36:29.860
And then there's a full record selection with record players.

2446
02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:34.650
There's old school arcade games.
Full Sofas.
Wow.
Yeah.

2447
02:36:34.720 --> 02:36:37.360
It's dope to Tam cause it's,
it's pretty unique.

2448
02:36:37.420 --> 02:36:40.310
I'm pretty excited about Milwaukee cause I'm never been.
The sock is great.

2449
02:36:40.400 --> 02:36:45.010
You got to go Miami,
Milwaukee and the end in March in DC.
DCM problem.

2450
02:36:45.250 --> 02:36:50.080
There you go.
I know.
All be on your site.
[inaudible] k.com t fat k.com.

2451
02:36:50.110 --> 02:36:54.520
Yes sir.
Alright.
Um,
is there anything else to show?
No Gene?

2452
02:36:55.090 --> 02:36:55.923
No.
No.

2453
02:36:56.340 --> 02:37:00.040
What do you guys get you back on the road right now it's at the comedy store

2454
02:37:00.041 --> 02:37:03.090
that much.
We're on the road a lot right now on the road.
The road.

2455
02:37:03.250 --> 02:37:05.550
I'm there tonight.
I'm coming tonight.
Oh,
perfect.
Yeah.

2456
02:37:06.220 --> 02:37:11.170
Then I saw you the other night,
right?
Yes.
Yeah.
Is it,

2457
02:37:11.171 --> 02:37:14.320
you know what I find out by nine 30 dude,
you're smart.

2458
02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:16.490
It's so nice when to get in and out.

2459
02:37:16.790 --> 02:37:21.320
I find myself turning down a lot of stuff because too late I just don't want to

2460
02:37:21.321 --> 02:37:24.140
take away from my son that I know.
That's how I am.

2461
02:37:24.240 --> 02:37:27.090
Like you want me to do what not happening man?
There's no worries.
No.

2462
02:37:27.110 --> 02:37:30.920
Tonight my spots,
I have two spots there.
Eight 15 and nine 30 kids.
Perfect.

2463
02:37:31.010 --> 02:37:35.870
Was it 10 was it 10 30 but then know you wake up early for the kid up when my

2464
02:37:35.871 --> 02:37:40.490
son 5:30 AM.
Yeah,
Bro.
That's brutal,
right?
Brewed all.

2465
02:37:40.491 --> 02:37:42.800
Stand up at night and then wake up with the little one.
Yeah.

2466
02:37:45.040 --> 02:37:49.400
It's a good problem to have.
I guess it is.
We all do with kids,
man.

2467
02:37:49.670 --> 02:37:53.790
That's what we do.
It's how it is when you get our kids together,
dude.

2468
02:37:53.810 --> 02:37:56.060
There's no excuse.
Now we're fucking next to each other.

2469
02:37:56.090 --> 02:37:59.720
Super close to each other.
Yeah.
So in here,

2470
02:37:59.721 --> 02:38:03.530
who all records this whole,
and this is this whole bill.

2471
02:38:03.531 --> 02:38:08.480
It's just like a Rogan thing.
So we're here every week.
Uh,

2472
02:38:08.630 --> 02:38:11.630
Dr Drew's there.
Love doctor drew cyclones.

2473
02:38:11.660 --> 02:38:16.310
The way it hurts officer has the biggest hog for real.
That's the facts.

2474
02:38:16.370 --> 02:38:21.020
I'm going to ask me fat a stick from his boy.
Fat As deck.
Okay,

2475
02:38:21.021 --> 02:38:24.830
well ask him.
Ask Him.
Ask him on until track after dark.

2476
02:38:24.860 --> 02:38:29.060
It's a little bit of the talk,
but I'm telling you as a fan.
Oh Shit.

2477
02:38:29.120 --> 02:38:32.930
I gotta bring that up.
It's like a pipe.
I heard.
Really?

2478
02:38:32.931 --> 02:38:37.370
I guess it's like crazy big.
We got to ask a lot of things.
Making more sense.

2479
02:38:37.371 --> 02:38:41.810
Right.
Mike McCarthy is a,
yeah.
Yeah,
it was coast forever.

2480
02:38:41.840 --> 02:38:46.090
So this is the biggest day.
Oh my God.
And I was like,
he's Jack,

2481
02:38:46.091 --> 02:38:48.560
he's giving us you though.
You see the biceps on that dude.
Yeah,
he's,

2482
02:38:48.570 --> 02:38:53.360
he's in great shape.
Yeah,
it looks great.
Downplays it too.
Which would make sense.

2483
02:38:53.390 --> 02:38:54.920
He has the biggest Dick Energy.

2484
02:38:54.980 --> 02:38:57.580
Like he's just so calm and collected about it and he knows it.

2485
02:38:57.581 --> 02:39:00.830
He knows so much smarter and everybody is so much smarter.

2486
02:39:00.860 --> 02:39:03.870
I know duty blows me away when he talks.
I'm like,
what?

2487
02:39:03.890 --> 02:39:07.760
Like I just take sit this round out because we don't,
we don't hang around.

2488
02:39:07.761 --> 02:39:10.190
Regular people are like educated people.

2489
02:39:10.220 --> 02:39:12.710
We just hang out with a comedian douche bags all the time.

2490
02:39:12.711 --> 02:39:16.640
So when he talks like doctor talk,
I'm always like nothing to add.

2491
02:39:17.540 --> 02:39:21.350
Very cool.
Fantastic.
Like no fucking way,
man.

2492
02:39:24.270 --> 02:39:28.730
Do you fart a lot?
Or what else?
Sickler is here.

2493
02:39:29.390 --> 02:39:34.310
He starts recording in a Ryan Week.
Yup.
Good Dude.

2494
02:39:34.400 --> 02:39:38.740
Who else?
There's a couple other that are,
I don't want to burn them,

2495
02:39:38.750 --> 02:39:42.200
but there's a couple of too bad.
Didn't blurt something out because,
no,
no,
no,
no,

2496
02:39:42.201 --> 02:39:45.650
no.
It's all good.
It's all good.
We'll just cut it.
We'll just edit it out.
Okay,

2497
02:39:45.651 --> 02:39:48.110
cool.
It's fine.
No,
but yeah,
they'll be here soon.

2498
02:39:48.111 --> 02:39:51.680
Santina [inaudible] going to edit this?
No,
he's not.
He's not really.
No,

2499
02:39:51.681 --> 02:39:53.870
because he was going to,
and he started talking about like,

2500
02:39:53.900 --> 02:39:56.900
you know the commute and he's just doing his own thing.
It's great.

2501
02:39:56.901 --> 02:39:58.820
We're total fans.
He'll be back as a guest,

2502
02:39:58.821 --> 02:40:02.600
but he was gonna do it here and then he started to,
you know,
it'd be like,
oh,

2503
02:40:02.690 --> 02:40:06.170
I'll have to do some close to my place.
I was like,
I got to come here.

2504
02:40:06.170 --> 02:40:09.320
It has to be here.
So,
but it's like there's no,
there's no,

2505
02:40:09.610 --> 02:40:13.200
we're going to edit this out,
right?
We get this stuff out.
No,
we'll leave it.

2506
02:40:13.201 --> 02:40:15.900
I'm really sorry.
You guys are killing it though.
So are you,
man,

2507
02:40:15.910 --> 02:40:20.860
I like to say thanks man.
Thanks.
Um,
yeah,

2508
02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:24.780
we're neighbors.
Thank you for coming over.
Yeah,
man.
I live with the big brown.

2509
02:40:24.781 --> 02:40:28.470
We'll do it again soon.
I hope.
Um,
love having you on dude.

2510
02:40:28.471 --> 02:40:33.180
Thanks so much Josh.
Come.
Yeah.
Hey Josh,
we keep me posted man.

2511
02:40:34.450 --> 02:40:37.680
Yeah.
He said,
well let me know when you bust that nut dude.
For sure.

2512
02:40:37.681 --> 02:40:39.270
We're going to have a party or something.
Right.

2513
02:40:39.271 --> 02:40:44.271
She screenshot it and frame your Emoji talk and I'll sign it.

2514
02:40:44.310 --> 02:40:48.720
That's a good idea.
We need to get these screenshots of these conversations,

2515
02:40:48.721 --> 02:40:52.680
especially if it actually goes down.
If he finishes,
then let's get this.

2516
02:40:52.830 --> 02:40:54.660
We need the evidence.
We need to see the trail.

2517
02:40:54.690 --> 02:40:59.190
Don't what party come party thinking.
Josh,

2518
02:40:59.191 --> 02:40:59.791
that's a great idea.

2519
02:40:59.791 --> 02:41:01.900
We're going to throw you a come party at Brendan's new house,

2520
02:41:03.110 --> 02:41:06.990
that sky zone so he can jump on the trampolines with hopes.
Yeah,
Bro.

2521
02:41:07.980 --> 02:41:12.900
What do you think?
Is that a good idea?
I'll be passing it totally down.

2522
02:41:13.390 --> 02:41:17.160
Alright.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Common party sounds great.

2523
02:41:17.161 --> 02:41:21.850
And compile and then zone dancing with the freak freak's like the junkies and

2524
02:41:21.851 --> 02:41:26.100
shit we do at Dave and busters too though.
Dave and Buster's.

2525
02:41:26.101 --> 02:41:29.430
Dave and bust even better Bros,
Josh and bust.

2526
02:41:30.250 --> 02:41:35.010
Um.
All right.
I think that's it.
All right,
man.
All right.
I'm going to leave now.

2527
02:41:35.080 --> 02:41:38.340
I know what's going on.
What do you mean?
Are you finding a song?
No,

2528
02:41:38.400 --> 02:41:42.440
I was just waiting.
Wait,
searching the web.
Oh yeah.

2529
02:41:43.270 --> 02:41:45.900
I'm trying to,
thanks again for giving me this.
That's very nice.

2530
02:41:45.930 --> 02:41:49.800
You gave me two fucking jewelry pieces.

2531
02:41:49.830 --> 02:41:54.540
Just revisiting Christina.
Meanwhile,
I won't fucking buy one.
I'm gonna stay.

2532
02:41:54.541 --> 02:41:57.880
I'm going to connect you with my guy.
Oh my God.
At least I can.
Please don't.

2533
02:41:57.960 --> 02:42:01.890
Please don't.
Please do.
Go to college.
Why the fuck are you doing this?

2534
02:42:01.950 --> 02:42:05.370
Why the fuck are you doing that one of your acting?
Get Real mad at me.

2535
02:42:05.450 --> 02:42:07.450
What the fuck are you doing?
Why are you doing this thing?

2536
02:42:07.480 --> 02:42:09.330
If your wife asks you to scratch your head,

2537
02:42:09.850 --> 02:42:13.390
does she ever ask for head scratchies and bed?
No.
Yeah,

2538
02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:19.110
you affectionate.
I'm a lover for sure.
I mean,
she's way more affectionate.

2539
02:42:19.140 --> 02:42:23.520
She's Mexican,
the shit.
So they're super affectionate,
you know,
kind of rough.

2540
02:42:25.290 --> 02:42:28.680
That's why he became a fighter man.
Mm.
I guess.

2541
02:42:28.950 --> 02:42:31.320
I mean you see all this jewelry shit,
but you don't know where it came from.

2542
02:42:35.970 --> 02:42:37.560
Those chains.
A change in a man.

2543
02:42:38.220 --> 02:42:42.320
Definitely want the swag around the house or what?
Oh my God.
Brow.

2544
02:42:44.260 --> 02:42:48.900
It is how it is right now.
So it is Bam,
Bam,

2545
02:42:48.930 --> 02:42:52.050
pow.
He was obviously,

2546
02:42:52.051 --> 02:42:55.350
I laid next to him in bed and then I asked for head scratches.
So good.

2547
02:42:55.390 --> 02:42:58.320
I hope you sleep a lot of head scratching.
It's just my currency.

2548
02:42:58.321 --> 02:43:00.110
It's what I love.
He's going to agree with me on that.

2549
02:43:00.120 --> 02:43:03.210
I barter for head scratches all that's how he's going to agree with me on this.

2550
02:43:03.300 --> 02:43:04.133
Anyways,

2551
02:43:04.200 --> 02:43:09.200
he won't give me the head scratches unless it's exactly my head is exactly what

2552
02:43:09.850 --> 02:43:13.990
it's worth.
Your cause in your arm gets tired.
Your forum just it get tired.

2553
02:43:13.991 --> 02:43:17.830
He's late.
I'm laying down,
we're laying down.
He can't bend his elbow like this.

2554
02:43:17.831 --> 02:43:21.600
If you want to lay here,
you're laying in bed like,
look,

2555
02:43:21.820 --> 02:43:24.070
you're laying down watching TV.

2556
02:43:24.070 --> 02:43:27.130
Like I'm going to go to bed and she asks for head scratch.
You Go.

2557
02:43:27.690 --> 02:43:31.470
Don't go to Ben Taub,
man.
How about you make it convenient like you,

2558
02:43:31.471 --> 02:43:35.720
you're want the thing.
So could you be where my hand naturally lazy.

2559
02:43:36.250 --> 02:43:40.450
She's all like over here.
I'm like,
well,
can I have to go like this?
So I'm like,

2560
02:43:40.451 --> 02:43:42.310
how about you just lay your head over here?

2561
02:43:42.311 --> 02:43:45.570
So all I did was I just pushed her head and then scratch there.

2562
02:43:45.580 --> 02:43:48.640
It's easier for you,
works for you.
Do you hear what he said?

2563
02:43:48.670 --> 02:43:53.340
He pushed my head last night like I was a dog on the bed.
Like it over there.

2564
02:43:53.930 --> 02:43:56.800
That's a little fucked up.
They could've asked,

2565
02:43:56.950 --> 02:44:00.640
but I'm with him making it more right.
But he could have asked him about,

2566
02:44:00.650 --> 02:44:03.760
it was kind of rude to just push your head like you guys get a fight after that.

2567
02:44:03.820 --> 02:44:06.400
No,
I don't find it on that.
I pick,
I pick my battles.

2568
02:44:06.670 --> 02:44:09.910
I bust his chops in a joking.
I just don't seem like you fight very much.

2569
02:44:11.560 --> 02:44:13.840
I love him.
You have to understand.
Oh,
you'd have to.

2570
02:44:13.990 --> 02:44:17.500
I Adore Thompson Sigora like a door.

2571
02:44:17.501 --> 02:44:21.940
He really can do no wrong in my eyes,
which is probably,

2572
02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:26.680
I don't know the secret.
I adore you to no,
but I actively,

2573
02:44:27.100 --> 02:44:31.210
I,
I make sure he has treats in the house.
Treats.
Yeah.

2574
02:44:31.211 --> 02:44:35.980
I feed him.
I pet him.
I love him.
I love you.

2575
02:44:35.981 --> 02:44:39.870
I do the same time.
I know you take care of me.
It's,
and it's all scratchy.

2576
02:44:39.880 --> 02:44:44.440
So I go,
this is uncomfortable.
Like you're pushed my hand.
I didn't look that,

2577
02:44:44.980 --> 02:44:47.920
that is not what I did not dismiss it.
We'll do it.
Do it.

2578
02:44:47.921 --> 02:44:52.020
How you did it last night.
Okay,
here's your head.
Yeah.
Yeah,

2579
02:44:52.060 --> 02:44:54.340
but you pushed my head.
I kept scratching,

2580
02:44:54.970 --> 02:44:56.910
kept scratching and then one time Brendan,

2581
02:44:56.920 --> 02:45:00.850
I was laying down sleeping and he comes in,
I'm,
I'm asleep.

2582
02:45:01.120 --> 02:45:02.600
He comes in and I'm,

2583
02:45:02.860 --> 02:45:07.860
my head's on the pillow and then he starts fluffing his pillow,

2584
02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:13.360
my pillow
and you were sleeping.
But here's,

2585
02:45:15.400 --> 02:45:16.720
here's what's up.
Here's the truth.

2586
02:45:20.620 --> 02:45:22.480
Here's the thing.
I didn't know she was in bed.

2587
02:45:24.730 --> 02:45:27.430
That's when that happened.
Children,
it was just the two of us.

2588
02:45:27.431 --> 02:45:32.320
And that's when that happened.
I don't know where you were.

2589
02:45:32.650 --> 02:45:35.770
Two bedroom apartment at that point.
You know that that's the story.

2590
02:45:36.280 --> 02:45:38.650
You were covered up and I didn't realize you were in bed.

2591
02:45:38.680 --> 02:45:40.570
That's why I walked up to my pillow and I was like,

2592
02:45:40.571 --> 02:45:43.440
this isn't fluff and I smashed the hell out of it.

2593
02:45:43.480 --> 02:45:45.600
It was smashing that you really got to get into.

2594
02:45:45.770 --> 02:45:49.240
I was pounding it and then you were like,
what's going on?
I was like,
Oh shit.

2595
02:45:49.241 --> 02:45:52.810
I didn't know you were in here.
That's what,
that's what I look how you leave out.

2596
02:45:52.811 --> 02:45:56.530
Like the most key point of that story,

2597
02:45:56.890 --> 02:46:00.260
which was that I definitely didn't know you were asleep in bed.
Yeah.

2598
02:46:00.520 --> 02:46:03.640
What's the maddest you've ever got at Tom?
Oh God.

2599
02:46:04.060 --> 02:46:08.770
Just been get together for a hot second.
Yeah.
Let me think on it.
I don't,

2600
02:46:09.950 --> 02:46:12.230
I don't,
he doesn't do a lot to infuriate me.

2601
02:46:13.970 --> 02:46:16.220
He doesn't do a lot of me.
I'm telling you dude,

2602
02:46:16.221 --> 02:46:21.170
like have been close to go their separate ways.
No,
never.
Never.
I mean,

2603
02:46:21.171 --> 02:46:25.120
I haven't have you.
This is the reason why he doesn't listen to me.

2604
02:46:25.240 --> 02:46:29.060
Women are mother fucking hate carts.

2605
02:46:29.850 --> 02:46:33.040
There's that about this.
I've stuff that irritates me like this.

2606
02:46:33.041 --> 02:46:34.630
Like when he's on his pushy button,

2607
02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:37.540
Nautilus and never listening to me like I at least five times a day,

2608
02:46:37.541 --> 02:46:39.760
I have to be like,
are you listening to me?
Are you listening to me?

2609
02:46:39.900 --> 02:46:43.470
It's impossible.
Well,
the tax and list of a cell,
it's hard to tell a story.
Still.

2610
02:46:43.471 --> 02:46:47.610
Dylan's on,
they're texting.
They're like,
uh Huh.
Uh Huh.
Yeah.
Listening.
Yeah.

2611
02:46:48.190 --> 02:46:49.730
Well that's up on my Instagram.
Hey guys,

2612
02:46:49.731 --> 02:46:53.280
I'm on a roll today because women are fucking stupid.
There you go.

2613
02:46:54.420 --> 02:46:57.720
There you go.
That's what I deal with.
What about you and your lady?

2614
02:46:58.560 --> 02:47:01.470
What do you think drives her crazy about you?
Tons of stuff.

2615
02:47:02.020 --> 02:47:05.550
She has OCD and she's like real clean.
Oh,
just don't give a fuck.

2616
02:47:06.090 --> 02:47:08.080
I'm too busy conquering other stuffs.

2617
02:47:08.090 --> 02:47:12.030
I don't know if there's a math or something like that.
I'll get to it.
Yeah.

2618
02:47:12.070 --> 02:47:16.680
You know,
like it's not a priority for me.
We're both messy,
so that's a blessing.

2619
02:47:17.280 --> 02:47:20.200
So then it's,
since you're both messy,
you pay someone to clean it up.
Yeah,

2620
02:47:20.250 --> 02:47:24.100
absolutely.
Right.
And we always have.
Yeah.
So worth it.
Yeah.
No,

2621
02:47:24.180 --> 02:47:28.860
no fights about other shit to do.
Waste of time.
It's not that important.
Yeah.

2622
02:47:29.430 --> 02:47:33.000
Not that important.
What else do I do that pisses you off?

2623
02:47:34.070 --> 02:47:36.950
Mostly not,
not listening.
God.
The device.

2624
02:47:36.951 --> 02:47:41.580
The constant phone looking like you're and then,
yeah.
Fun.

2625
02:47:41.750 --> 02:47:45.630
Yeah.
I think most people are dope.
It's the modern stope.

2626
02:47:45.700 --> 02:47:50.030
Everybody's addicted.
The most disciplined people I know are addicted to it.

2627
02:47:50.390 --> 02:47:53.280
I try to do things now though,
where I will,
uh,
you know,

2628
02:47:53.281 --> 02:47:57.370
if I'll go and like play room with my kid,
I'll leave it on the stairs.
Oh cool.

2629
02:47:57.480 --> 02:48:01.520
That's not even on me.
Usually Saturdays and Sundays I'll just,

2630
02:48:01.670 --> 02:48:05.050
I leave my phone upstairs.
I don't even touch my feet.
That's a great idea.
I'll,

2631
02:48:05.060 --> 02:48:07.560
if I have like a show or something the following week,
I'll post that morning.

2632
02:48:07.610 --> 02:48:08.443
I just,

2633
02:48:08.560 --> 02:48:11.750
I don't even touch it and most of my friends know that if they want to get ahold

2634
02:48:11.780 --> 02:48:15.360
of me up not signing on Sunday,
I won't be around my family like that.
Yeah,

2635
02:48:15.630 --> 02:48:18.360
I like that.
Did you know that there's a feature that you can see how long,

2636
02:48:18.361 --> 02:48:20.910
how much screen time you've had.
I shouldn't pops up now.

2637
02:48:20.911 --> 02:48:22.920
Like you're down 30% from last week.

2638
02:48:22.921 --> 02:48:27.060
You only spent four hours and 30 minutes a day.
That's a lie.
Fuck yeah,

2639
02:48:27.090 --> 02:48:27.780
but does that,

2640
02:48:27.780 --> 02:48:31.680
but I'm thinking they're counting podcasts I listen to when I drive down

2641
02:48:31.740 --> 02:48:36.000
everything.
I Dunno.
Is it,
are they,
I don't know.
I don't know how they do it.

2642
02:48:36.030 --> 02:48:40.170
How it calculates,
scratch.
Horrifying.
Have you seen that?
Oh yeah.
And you're like,

2643
02:48:40.171 --> 02:48:42.540
whoa.
It'll make you feel like a piece of shit.
Yeah.

2644
02:48:42.690 --> 02:48:45.330
Or when I'm like trying to do this and my son's like,
Daddy,
Daddy,
I'm like,

2645
02:48:46.140 --> 02:48:49.290
probably get this to,
you know,
but it's just business.
Yeah.
And I'm like,

2646
02:48:49.291 --> 02:48:51.540
I don't handle it because he doesn't know it's a business.
He's probably like,

2647
02:48:51.541 --> 02:48:53.650
all these phones more important than whatever I'm doing.
Look,

2648
02:48:53.700 --> 02:48:58.320
he just did it right now.
Jesus.
And it's always there.
It's always urgent.

2649
02:48:58.480 --> 02:49:02.930
There's always a reason.
But then she also always doesn't get it.
But like I said,

2650
02:49:02.940 --> 02:49:06.720
there's a reason for,
there's always a reason.
There's always a reason.

2651
02:49:06.721 --> 02:49:07.710
But here's deal man,

2652
02:49:08.010 --> 02:49:12.210
is that people now it's always business,

2653
02:49:12.240 --> 02:49:15.060
but the reason it's always urgent that they can get ahold of,
you know,

2654
02:49:15.061 --> 02:49:19.560
24 seven problem.
And if you,
if you let them get ahold of you instantaneously,

2655
02:49:19.561 --> 02:49:23.600
24 seven I want that message to come in.
Right.

2656
02:49:23.650 --> 02:49:27.420
I know I want to respond to it.
Okay.
You're waiting for an important message.

2657
02:49:28.500 --> 02:49:31.470
I'm communicating with him so it's not that important.

2658
02:49:31.500 --> 02:49:33.360
Well it's or are you saying please wrap,

2659
02:49:33.361 --> 02:49:36.990
get shoved the fuck out and talk about this song man.

2660
02:49:36.991 --> 02:49:40.070
Like oh he's traveling and my Hassan but then like,

2661
02:49:40.080 --> 02:49:43.050
but then this is what happens to it with,
with your touring,

2662
02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:44.440
you know what I'm saying?

2663
02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:49.170
Like cause for you at the take turns with you also don't,

2664
02:49:49.490 --> 02:49:53.750
don't,
you're not as on top of it as I am business wise.

2665
02:49:53.900 --> 02:49:58.470
The of course like you'll just be like,
that's fine.
But that's what I'm saying.

2666
02:49:58.471 --> 02:50:00.890
So then you're giving me a hard time about the gate.

2667
02:50:02.250 --> 02:50:04.740
Can't both be the business.
Not all the time.

2668
02:50:04.770 --> 02:50:07.350
One of us has to watch the kids and take care of the kids,

2669
02:50:07.351 --> 02:50:11.010
but even right now it's like that's it.
Like I'm not going to ignore that.
Right.

2670
02:50:11.130 --> 02:50:13.680
They say you can only have one headshot in the household,

2671
02:50:13.681 --> 02:50:18.300
but you guys were the only couple of that's figured it out.
I never heard that.

2672
02:50:18.370 --> 02:50:22.860
I've never heard that number and that I don't know.
But I do think that I,

2673
02:50:23.100 --> 02:50:26.370
I mean right now I've got a baby and a toddler,
so they're my priority.

2674
02:50:26.371 --> 02:50:28.770
So you would,
he's back on the touring.

2675
02:50:28.860 --> 02:50:31.800
He back on a lot of shit so that they're the priority.

2676
02:50:31.801 --> 02:50:34.740
Definitely 100% when you were to go full throttle and you would prefer that.

2677
02:50:34.740 --> 02:50:39.120
I just don't pick up.
No,
no,
no.
All I'm saying is I honestly don't care right now,

2678
02:50:39.150 --> 02:50:43.020
but I'm saying if we're at dinner and we're all sitting around eating that,
yeah.

2679
02:50:43.021 --> 02:50:46.650
Like it takes real discipline,
man to do it again.

2680
02:50:47.250 --> 02:50:49.860
The most disciplined people I know struggle with it.
So I'm like,

2681
02:50:49.861 --> 02:50:53.370
this is some fucking addictive stuff,
man.
It is.

2682
02:50:53.430 --> 02:50:57.870
These people are suffering from it
or just when we're with the kids.

2683
02:50:57.871 --> 02:51:00.740
I think that's what bothers me.
What?
Okay.

2684
02:51:01.560 --> 02:51:06.480
You feel like that's a real issue or if the kid asking me right now,
I said no,

2685
02:51:06.481 --> 02:51:09.000
the only time it bothers me is when one with the kids cause then that's the

2686
02:51:09.001 --> 02:51:12.160
message they get that they're not as important as your text message was.
Look,

2687
02:51:12.161 --> 02:51:14.850
you have a phone problem Tom.
Yeah,
we figured this out.

2688
02:51:14.851 --> 02:51:16.260
I feel like doctor drew right now.

2689
02:51:16.740 --> 02:51:21.640
I helped him with his fucking come emojis and ship advice on doctors.

2690
02:51:21.680 --> 02:51:23.700
I just heard you on Dr drafter dark.

2691
02:51:23.701 --> 02:51:28.680
You were saying how you liked that Ari encourages you to put your phone down

2692
02:51:28.681 --> 02:51:31.230
more.
I do but you're not already and you also,

2693
02:51:33.010 --> 02:51:37.890
you're also completely unreasonable because you were in charge of my phone.

2694
02:51:38.100 --> 02:51:41.940
There would be so much shit that slips through the cracks and doesn't get done.

2695
02:51:41.970 --> 02:51:44.670
I'm on top of stuff.
I take care of business,

2696
02:51:45.740 --> 02:51:49.020
but then you still are someone who is like,
God,
you're on your phone.
Yes,

2697
02:51:49.021 --> 02:51:53.220
a handling business,
but not hire someone to do this.

2698
02:51:53.430 --> 02:51:58.320
Hire someone,
agent or manager or sometimes I'm communicating with them.
I know.

2699
02:51:58.410 --> 02:52:00.200
It's like,
why do I have your foot?
Why?
Why?

2700
02:52:00.420 --> 02:52:03.270
Why have a middle man when I'm doing it anyways?
Yeah,
of course.
Man.

2701
02:52:03.480 --> 02:52:07.290
I'm a fucking beast though.
It's a beast.
Yeah.
I don't know the answer.

2702
02:52:07.300 --> 02:52:11.350
There's a lot of people that I have to communicate with on a regular a lot.
Yeah.

2703
02:52:11.710 --> 02:52:15.310
I mean here there's people that communicate with all the time.
Then yeah,

2704
02:52:15.311 --> 02:52:18.210
there's business people.
Agents May,
I also think that your,

2705
02:52:18.250 --> 02:52:20.850
your condition where you feel like you have to respond to the email,

2706
02:52:20.860 --> 02:52:23.200
you have to respond to the text.
You know?
That's true.

2707
02:52:23.230 --> 02:52:25.390
You don't have to respond not to do shit.
No,

2708
02:52:25.980 --> 02:52:29.380
but respond asap or are you going to lose that show?

2709
02:52:29.381 --> 02:52:31.570
Are you going to lose this or that?
No.
No,

2710
02:52:31.720 --> 02:52:35.200
but there are things that like you also realize,
if I don't respond to this,

2711
02:52:35.650 --> 02:52:38.860
I'm not going to remember to do this.
Oh,
you're so you're worried if you don't

2712
02:52:40.360 --> 02:52:42.040
listen to me.
I'm not saying that you don't,

2713
02:52:42.100 --> 02:52:44.020
you shouldn't respond to your business stuff.

2714
02:52:44.320 --> 02:52:47.310
I'm just saying there should be certain boundaries,
right?
Like I don't know when,

2715
02:52:47.380 --> 02:52:48.610
when you're home with the family,

2716
02:52:48.611 --> 02:52:53.611
maybe the phone isn't the main priority at seven o'clock more six c just have

2717
02:52:55.151 --> 02:52:59.380
boundaries and it protects you and gives you a chance to have a rest.

2718
02:53:00.230 --> 02:53:03.490
Good.
It also feels so good when I leave my phone somewhere,

2719
02:53:03.491 --> 02:53:06.790
I'm gone the entire day.
I'm like,
oh,
thank God man.
No,
I agree.

2720
02:53:06.920 --> 02:53:11.710
I've already does.
Where it has a flip phone.
There's a social media.
I wish,
man,

2721
02:53:12.110 --> 02:53:15.780
now I forgotten to healthy is healthy at the house and been out entire day,

2722
02:53:15.781 --> 02:53:18.590
which is nice.
You don't feel tied down by it.
No,

2723
02:53:19.180 --> 02:53:23.300
but I mean I'd leave it charging in rooms all the time,
you know,

2724
02:53:24.110 --> 02:53:27.430
like in the attic right now.
But we'll figure it out.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2725
02:53:28.600 --> 02:53:29.710
Everyone has a problem.
I mean,

2726
02:53:29.711 --> 02:53:31.930
I'm sure if you brought my girl and then she said the exact same thing,

2727
02:53:32.430 --> 02:53:34.990
the exact same Ms.
Dot.
Yeah.
But I'm also,
I mean,

2728
02:53:34.991 --> 02:53:39.230
more people are trying to reach me then,
you know,
look,
I know,
hey,

2729
02:53:40.040 --> 02:53:44.340
I'm grateful that you handle all the business stuff you do,

2730
02:53:44.400 --> 02:53:48.940
