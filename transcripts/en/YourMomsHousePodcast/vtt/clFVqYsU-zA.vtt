00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.740
<v 2>I turned it to a telescope.
When I see your pains,</v>

55
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.160
you feel so good to me.
They would not meet you and you tell to me,

56
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.260
I want you to milk me like hot chocolate and candy and not with high bro.

57
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.820
You melt me every day.

<v 1>Well,

Go to your mom's house.</v>

63
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.453
<v 4>Uh,</v>

64
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.520
can I tell you what I've all of that I wanted to,
I had two questions.
One,

65
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.870
where the fuck did that guy get a cell phone and sunglasses in prison.

66
00:04:32.871 --> 00:04:33.704
He's in prison.

67
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.300
The dental work and the haircut or prison appropriate but the cell phone and a

68
00:04:38.301 --> 00:04:42.390
fucking song.
Last cell block bees over there.
Again,
fucking shout out.

69
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.440
I just always fascinating

70
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.330
<v 0>by the length,
the depth that men will go to.</v>

71
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.600
I mean all of us want to get laid,
but like,
like you know,

72
00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:55.850
some people just out there like I'll make you calm guy.

73
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.250
<v 4>Yeah.
Well they throw it out there too hard.
It's not,</v>

74
00:04:59.251 --> 00:05:00.510
it's not always a good approach.

75
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.660
<v 2>Oh,
this great snack day.</v>

76
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.010
I've been looking at your picture so low and they met and they magnify my Eyes

77
00:05:14.551 --> 00:05:15.384
Bay.

78
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.500
<v 4>Oh see what happened was your picture did that to his eyes.
Oh,</v>

79
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.260
telescope the telescope.

80
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.630
<v 2>I turned it to a telescope.
When I see your pain,
what do you see your baby,</v>

81
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.250
they would not meet you.
Are you talking to me?

82
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.340
I want you to milk me like hot chocolate and candy and not with high bro.

83
00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.150
Well,
we cool hot breath.

84
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.600
You melt me every day.

85
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.240
<v 4>Prison poetry,
right?
Yeah,
that is.
You know what though?
I know why this works.</v>

86
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.440
I know why guys are,

87
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:51.730
please tell us I got it because it does work and it,

88
00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:55.750
because every woman deep down inside wants to be told this stuff.

89
00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.620
Maybe not that Shell.
Yeah.
Not In that presentation,

90
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.090
but we all want to hear that.
You want that candy bar just not that route.

91
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.310
That's right.
Thank you very much.

94
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.190

95
00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:18.100
I don't know if you've ever,

96
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.480
<v 6>Price.</v>

97
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.480
You go or you can just make club to someone they know

98
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.310
and then in the morning they go there where you go your way.

99
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.490
<v 4>Yeah.
Prostitutes.
Yeah.
Prostitutes.
What's he watching in the background?</v>

100
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.040
That's always the question.
It was Rachel Maddow.
I wish I was like,

101
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:43.850
I didn't feel good.
This guy from Msnbc type,
but this right here,

102
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.910
<v 6>are felons.
Nothing.

103
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.670
buy a house cleaning question clean.

104
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.800
Because for my buddy Matt was good down there,

105
00:06:53.801 --> 00:06:57.330
you know bound their crane guys are always worried about that.

106
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.930
<v 4>Yeah.
And also I think he put his teeth in just for this.</v>

107
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.320
Well different different videos he had.
He treats you differently.

108
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.880
So this is one without

109
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.450
<v 6>sure.
Toss any heavier.
Yeah,</v>

110
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.720
they should be somebody out there wants to hook up Casper.
Yeah.

111
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.000
I wish you a rich woman

112
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.420
<v 4>and then he's nice enough to be like,
I'd be nice if she was rich to take.</v>

113
00:07:20.421 --> 00:07:23.060
Here's the thing about that,
there is someone out there,

114
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.420
someone else there was like,
I'm here.
Me,
somebody did a,

115
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.860
reached out to him and then he put his teeth in.

116
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.640
<v 7>Hello out there.
Hello.
Hope you're doing great kids.
A lot better.</v>

117
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.550
Look for me.
Yeah,
I like those too.
Thank you for all the vagina.

118
00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:44.040
Any shots?
Very nice.

119
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:51.190
<v 4>Everything about it is like the lighting is better.
His energy is like,</v>

120
00:07:51.191 --> 00:07:54.580
it definitely is fired up.
He also let me bit between the teeth.

121
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:59.470
He also meets the,
uh,
your mom's house criteria of having the television on,

122
00:07:59.471 --> 00:08:04.150
in the background and loudly so that he records his audio and that audio at the

123
00:08:04.151 --> 00:08:04.820
same time.

124
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:09.730
<v 7>Loud.
Beautiful,
warm Herman aren't here.
They get shit.</v>

125
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:13.790
God don't look oh great.
Hello.
Stay with you longer.

126
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.940
Cheat on you with another one.
They won't cheat on you with another guy.

127
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.940
<v 4>All right.
Is that the sales page for you though?</v>

128
00:08:24.941 --> 00:08:27.880
I love all his nick backs back there.
Do you see him?
Well Ryan,

129
00:08:27.881 --> 00:08:30.940
I don't know if you're familiar with the criterion for your mom's house video,

130
00:08:30.941 --> 00:08:35.500
but a,
the lighting has to be garbage.
Uh,
be the shot.

131
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:40.920
The shot has to be bad too.
It's gotta be shot from down here.
Uh,

132
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.840
there's these would be like a fan or something in the background that's even TV.

133
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.690
Audio has to be poor you about the box.
Have you,

134
00:08:49.691 --> 00:08:53.290
um,
I'm so excited to get to this,
that jumping all around.
First of all,

135
00:08:53.291 --> 00:08:56.600
why don't we book boyfriend?
Glad I love Ryan Ziglar.

136
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.860
<v 0>He's the bachelor nights.
So the album,
uh,
where did you record the album?</v>

137
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:06.050
I'm not allowed to say really mad.
They made me sign saying,
oh,

138
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.660
you probably know by me saying that,
but they made me sign a deal.
I was like,

139
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:12.900
I'd be happy to promote that.
And they're like,
nope.
So they wouldn't let me say,

140
00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:16.710
but it was in southern California.
Okay.
And what's the,
um,
I'm not even gonna,

141
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:19.380
I'm not trying to pry to get it,
but like,
you know,
what's the,
uh,

142
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.720
did they say don't,
you're not allowed to say,
I don't know.

143
00:09:21.721 --> 00:09:24.170
I don't know if it's part of like,
they don't want any war.

144
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.270
Everyone thinking they can come and do that.
You know what I mean?
I don't know.

145
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:29.070
Maybe it's the riff raff thing or,

146
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:32.120
because usually the places are happy to have the hook,

147
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.380
that ship mode or large print.
Yup.
Okay.
Um,

148
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.010
but you recorded it at a Anaheim Angel Stadium.

149
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:45.660
<v 4>100 people show it was in the dug out.
That's what we sell.</v>

150
00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.000
That's where we start to PAC man.
Right.
It wasn't anything.
That was it.

151
00:09:48.001 --> 00:09:52.880
I had High Bay village volt asleep.
Roy fires though.
Firestone.
Guys,

152
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:53.943
guys.

153
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.870
My favorite thing when the two of you get together because I've known you too.

154
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:02.160
I consider you a brother Ryan.
Thank you.
Sickle cell.
I've known you for 15 years.

155
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:05.610
I was just thinking about the other night.
It's been at least that maybe more.

156
00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:09.900
You've been a guest in our home for holidays,
thanksgivings,
everything.

157
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.770
And my favorite thing when you come around is that you like Tommy up.

158
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.190
That's really the two of you.
What can we load?
So I know,
I'm telling.

159
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.390
Look at this.
Happy it been all day.

160
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:22.010
He's got that guy's teeth in right on the two wheeler.

161
00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:26.640
Better start talking like black guys immediately.
Yeah.

162
00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.200
You start yelling and black the minute you get.
Yeah.
All right.

163
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.210
Did you just did it in the dugout while we were yelling at Pac man?
Just yelling.

164
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.470
Yeah.
Oh,
it was not yelling and black.
I don't know.

165
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:40.230
I don't know if we would call it black and black.
Black Boys.
Um,

166
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.500
in a funny black boys.

167
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:47.280
<v 0>The,
uh,
Oh,
you have brothers?
I do.
Did you ever smoke meth with him?</v>

168
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.350
Never ever thought about it.

169
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:54.120
I have smoked weed with both my brothers and that's as far as my drug really

170
00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:56.970
goes anyway.
I'm not crate.
They,
they've done a lot more stuff.

171
00:10:56.971 --> 00:11:00.700
But you're someone who I always wanted to show this to.
Um,
smoke man.

172
00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:04.800
Do you know about this guy?
The Ma,
the math guy?
Sure.
Let me get a look at them.

173
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:05.940
I'm not good with names.

174
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.030
<v 4>Let's see.
Okay.</v>

175
00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.540
Do you pay any kind of disorder?
Oh,
it's the same.
Okay.

176
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.380
<v 8>Forget that bag or forget about salads.
Forget that.</v>

177
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.890
And Dick and plants and all that stuff.
So I don't know.

178
00:11:21.891 --> 00:11:23.780
Can you believe me or not?
God Damn it,
man.

179
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:26.760
You like this seem you smoked meth with a small limp Dick.

180
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.960
Did Dad get hardly any other way and why did you get harder and harder than

181
00:11:29.961 --> 00:11:33.450
Laura?
Smoke harder?
My Dick get this.
Unbelievable.

182
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:39.050
<v 4>He's,
first of all,
he's making edits on this video.
Oh,
you know,</v>

183
00:11:39.051 --> 00:11:42.200
it's interesting.
Every time someone new comes and sees it,
they add a layer.

184
00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:45.610
You're right.
But let's,
can we go back nearly halfway?
Yeah.

185
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.770
Can we go have a relative of my cousins and Emma,

186
00:11:48.771 --> 00:11:53.771
this is like a halfway house clearly want to go back to Christina's last point

187
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.990
of what great framing and

188
00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:03.680
it's all there man.
These guys are all under your,

189
00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:08.930
under your Chin is a layer is a layer in the,
uh,

190
00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:13.490
in the criteria.
Is it also a ridiculous ask?

191
00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:15.500
Cause this guys that you want to see me as moment,

192
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.550
it was a little dig and then to get harder and harder to take like a Choo Choo

193
00:12:19.551 --> 00:12:21.040
train.
The other guys,

194
00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:24.210
like if you just want to send me some pussy shots and panty shot,

195
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:25.470
it's always over.
And

196
00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:31.080
that's actually probably the production value because there's edits.
Yeah.

197
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.600
And then,
and then it goes to every right,
the [inaudible] near the top.

198
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.660
Yeah,
but wait,
it's,
so,
here's the best part.

199
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:42.350
As ridiculous as that is this,
uh,

200
00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.570
this was the lowest most,

201
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.050
this is the least ridiculous point of this video.

202
00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.460
Let me continue playing this for you.

203
00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.290
<v 8>Hey,
you won't believe how good it feels.
Good.
If you're straight,</v>

204
00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.850
he won't believe how good it feels.

205
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.340
You're drinking it become so sensitive that you don't need lube.

206
00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:03.890
We don't need spirit.
True Dick,
head this up and down four times.

207
00:13:03.891 --> 00:13:08.891
It's this hot bed and doing shit and normous Dick Dick Hot White Cup.

208
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.940
<v 4>Hi Is this is,
this guy's not a veteran at this.</v>

209
00:13:17.941 --> 00:13:21.270
He's a veteran like that's how deep he is.
Four Times.

210
00:13:21.271 --> 00:13:25.490
He knows all the steps.
Wait,
hold on.
You haven't even heard the best it

211
00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:29.850
<v 8>and then I've ever done in my life.
I know I'm gay.
I love it.</v>

212
00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:32.310
Get blowjobs and I'd tell you what,

213
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:37.790
I cannot wait when I'm so fucked up and hot and Horny home,
man,
I,

214
00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.480
I lay any days that can get me a book.

215
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:43.410
<v 4>Just anybody can do it.
I mean,
it's friendly about it.
Well,
here's the best part.</v>

216
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.410
<v 8>My brother didn't believe me that when he smoked with me,
he put his dick.</v>

217
00:13:47.411 --> 00:13:49.150
I can't believe how big his dick was.

218
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:54.050
He checked off him for stroke and shot the most common every time.
He's like,

219
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.390
he's only 49 and he's fine.
He has known the rock with the problems at home.
They

220
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.500
<v 4>a lot.
All the broader,
thicker and even more coming believes me.</v>

221
00:14:02.501 --> 00:14:04.860
Now you believe in that.

222
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:08.500
This guy just told the world his brother smoking meth with him,

223
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:11.620
whip to stick out and shot a load bigger than he's ever,

224
00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:15.510
ever has an all 49 of his years.
That's unbelievable.

225
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:17.320
Are you going to do that with your brother?
I can't wait.

226
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:20.810
I can't wait for Christmas.
We got something else to do now.

227
00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:22.970
Do you want to see me go from a limp Dick?
Too hard.

228
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.750
<v 8>What did it this weekend and I'll video tape it.
Got It</v>

229
00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:32.010
<v 4>smaller.
He's using bill.
Same video tape or there and harder.</v>

230
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.930
Right?
And let me know.
That bothered me a bit.
If you say yes,
I'll show it to you.

231
00:14:36.931 --> 00:14:40.250
Okie dokie.
Why does he have to keep reiterating?

232
00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:44.820
Mining is in a halfway house and just off camera to somebody over here playing

233
00:14:44.821 --> 00:14:48.140
solitaire on a car.
Somebody here's got some pieces.

234
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.010
I know exactly.
I don't even give up

235
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.980
<v 10>their blog.
Now you,
whatever Larry's at.
And again,</v>

236
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.040
in a lot for stroke.
I,
um,

237
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.000
I was back in Baltimore for my shows this weekend.
And,
um,

238
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.610
I went to a ravens game and you know,

239
00:15:07.611 --> 00:15:09.650
we make fun of the Baltimore accent all the time.

240
00:15:09.651 --> 00:15:14.060
And I heard so many really good,
uh,
just one liners,

241
00:15:14.061 --> 00:15:17.630
but with that accent.
But the one that stood out to me was this guy.

242
00:15:17.631 --> 00:15:20.180
We're all in line at the urinal and it's,
you know,
it's like five,

243
00:15:20.181 --> 00:15:23.330
six people deep.
Each one of them,
there's always the one guy,

244
00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:27.920
he's entertaining the whole bathroom and he starts talking about if you had to,

245
00:15:27.921 --> 00:15:30.560
would you eat your own Dick?
You know,
and that's in the bathroom.

246
00:15:30.561 --> 00:15:34.100
This is the question he presents to a public men's restroom and everybody this

247
00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.700
area or this corner where he is over there all starting to talk about it.

248
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.930
And one guy's like,
first dig in,
my math ain't go be by Dick.

249
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:46.780
I got teeth,
Pinky toes,
it one dick and I'm gonna eat my pinky toes first.

250
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:50.000
So they keep going and he's like,
I'm going ask it,

251
00:15:50.001 --> 00:15:53.960
a buddy of mine and we got to die.
You got to eat meat.
I eat you.

252
00:15:53.961 --> 00:15:58.400
And finally this one salty dude in the back gets tired of it and he just goes,

253
00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:03.050
put your dick away in,
move on.
When I started fucking laugh.

254
00:16:03.051 --> 00:16:07.460
It's so God the dude put your Dick away.

255
00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.860
He's up there all talking to people and he's like,

256
00:16:09.861 --> 00:16:14.861
put your take away immovable on phones too as a two syllable.

257
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.270
And that was a lot of fun

258
00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:25.190
<v 0>by the dawn's early.
Why
is that?</v>

259
00:16:25.191 --> 00:16:28.340
He has to wait.
Some bothers you.
The,

260
00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:35.270
he has to keep saying if you want to go from just a little too hard over and

261
00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:40.970
over fucking 10 times because he's actually trying to see who's excited about
it.

262
00:16:40.971 --> 00:16:44.150
You know,
he's trying hard and because there's somebody,

263
00:16:44.151 --> 00:16:48.380
there's guys that they were like,
fuck here there are Arctic.
Yes,

264
00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.740
and also my little Dick.
I want it to get hard.

265
00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:56.480
We now to make sense of the,
I want to show you the submission so badly.

266
00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.960
So are you familiar with this?
Right?

267
00:16:59.961 --> 00:17:01.940
Are you familiar with good morning Julia.

268
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.660
I mean so far I'm over here and that's sad.

269
00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.430
It's like we're going to be consistent here.
You hear that?
You heard that?

270
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.940
You know what that was Joe show,
isn't it?

271
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:16.100
But you know who this is the morning Julia,
try it guy.
No.
Okay,
fantastic.

272
00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:19.040
He has no idea.
So let me just give you a little background.

273
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:22.340
So we were actually supposed for people that don't know,

274
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:25.830
we were actually going to talk to her last week,
Julia,
Julia.

275
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:29.150
But the fire's created like kind of,
you know,
this has,

276
00:17:29.151 --> 00:17:33.080
we had kind of left here on a different day.
We're going to have her on,

277
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:37.350
hopefully I'll say hopefully next week.
We actually found Julia,
um,

278
00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:42.110
Julia is a young lady who one day

279
00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.710
had an encounter with this individual and the next day.

280
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.210
And by the way,
she wasn't like,
what are you doing?

281
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:56.490
We've got like to talk to you more.
She just met this dude.
And then like,

282
00:17:56.491 --> 00:18:00.720
where do you know,
I believe the store at the,
at the gym.
So publicly,
yeah.
The,

283
00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:04.020
the story of what was being passed around was that she met him at a bar and she

284
00:18:04.021 --> 00:18:06.970
let me know.
She goes,
that's not true.
I didn't meet him at a bar.
A shot,

285
00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.230
I'll give you the full story and I was told that the correct story is that they

286
00:18:10.231 --> 00:18:14.550
go to the same gym and he just happened to pick up on her name and somehow got

287
00:18:14.551 --> 00:18:19.470
her info.
She spoke to him like like,
hey,
how's it going at the gym?

288
00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:23.220
And then next day opens her phone and gets this on her.

289
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:28.200
<v 4>Oh Good Morning Julia.
Meet Gel.
Just wanted to say hi.</v>

290
00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.100
Wish you a great day.

291
00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:35.410
Tell you that meeting and you yesterday and getting a look at you was probably

292
00:18:35.411 --> 00:18:38.620
one of the greatest moments of my life.
You were so beautiful.

293
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:43.720
You don't know how beautiful you are to me.
I mean just,
you're gorgeous,

294
00:18:43.721 --> 00:18:44.560
you're precious.

295
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:47.080
<v 0>It's a little much.
But it's been</v>

296
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.710
<v 4>to my mind when you said to me,
you want to go back with your ex boyfriend,</v>

297
00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.970
please erase him from your memory.
Don't ever go back in the past.

298
00:18:54.971 --> 00:18:59.971
I know cause I've been there and I understand when you know that haircut and you

299
00:19:00.641 --> 00:19:05.410
go on dates and not the compares to your racks,

300
00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:09.940
but there is that better person out there and Julia,

301
00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:15.010
I promise you it is me.
I will love you like you never been loved before.

302
00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.870
Cherish shoe.
I'll make you feel like a woman,
a real woman,

303
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.450
and believe me,
after you experienced me,

304
00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.490
you won't even know who your ex boyfriend is.

305
00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:30.120
Open up your heart to me in your arms and you're on full throttle for the lack

306
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.270
of see me falling in love with you.
Go full throttle and just set it all.

307
00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.190
I just looked in your eyes and I just melt

308
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:38.930
<v 0>full travel.
And this is someone who just met.
Keep in mind,</v>

309
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.540
I mean a day earlier or a day before,
the day before.

310
00:19:42.541 --> 00:19:46.640
So she gave her his or she gave him her number?
I don't think so.

311
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.860
I mean it's not a normal guy like this.

312
00:19:48.861 --> 00:19:53.720
Wouldn't do anything shady like pay to find out what
it does.

313
00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:56.990
I'm sure she did it.
This story I hate,
I hate,

314
00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.500
I don't want to spread misinformation because when we were about to get the full

315
00:20:00.501 --> 00:20:02.800
story from her,
but uh,

316
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.410
somebody who said that they were friends with her said that he even discover her

317
00:20:06.411 --> 00:20:09.440
name by the sign in sheet.
Yeah,
that's crazy.

318
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:13.710
How did this video get out though?
He sent it to her and she posted it.
No,
no.

319
00:20:13.711 --> 00:20:18.020
You shared it with friends and then someone in that circle where it to share it

320
00:20:18.021 --> 00:20:20.510
more?
No,
just send it to their friends.
It literally,

321
00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:25.240
this went viral from Matt saying,
look,
look at,
I'm at the gym.
Yes.

322
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:29.480
And I got sent to us.
Well actually to be fair,
buzz feed,

323
00:20:29.481 --> 00:20:31.100
I didn't know this at all because you know,

324
00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:35.060
things get so big on the Internet so fast,
bigger than us.
You can,

325
00:20:35.061 --> 00:20:38.120
you can latch onto something.
A couple of years.

326
00:20:38.121 --> 00:20:42.620
This had a life on I think on buzzfeed a few years ago.
Oh,
years ago.

327
00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.730
Like 2016 let's say.
And so,
but I mean,
you know,

328
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:48.130
it got some

329
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.590
<v 4>notoriety and then it died down.
We discovered this,
I dunno,</v>

330
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.970
a couple of months ago.
I mean,
you know,
it's new to us.

331
00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:59.290
Has Anyone contacted this dude?
Well,
I don't know.
I mean,
I'm,
I now tell me this,

332
00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.750
if you're like me,
because we've shown this to a couple of people now,

333
00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.300
don't you feel like as a guy,

334
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.860
there's the part of your brain that identifies with what he's doing?
Like,

335
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.640
you know,
I feel embarrassment for him because I go,

336
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.880
you don't feel embarrassment for him.
Now I feel embarrassment for him.
I'm go,

337
00:21:15.881 --> 00:21:18.580
I'm thinking about your question.
You know that like,

338
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:22.990
you've met someone who you're like,
I wish I could,
uh,
you know,
uh,
whatever.

339
00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:26.640
Like you met someone,
you want to send them a message,
but your brain goes,
don't,

340
00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:31.240
not this,
don't,
don't put out too much.
Like,
hold back,

341
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:36.340
like your own instincts tell you,
uh,
if don't go over the top of like,
Oh my God,

342
00:21:36.341 --> 00:21:39.760
I love you because that's crazy to do.
And it's like,

343
00:21:39.761 --> 00:21:43.330
he doesn't have that part that goes for him.
It's like,
just put it all out there,

344
00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.900
opening up.
Your heart is going to love this.
She's going to just who I am.

345
00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:47.800
Exactly.
That's what everybody loves about me.

346
00:21:47.801 --> 00:21:51.230
That's why I live alone with three fucking ceiling fans.
Go back.

347
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:53.860
He's got two in the kitchen and some lighting.

348
00:21:53.861 --> 00:21:57.280
He's got a lot of shit on the ceilings here.
This is my cute little hall.

349
00:21:57.281 --> 00:22:00.390
I'll thank God everything.
I built everything,

350
00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:05.410
every square ridge from crown mold into chair rail,
foursquare,
Ridge,

351
00:22:05.411 --> 00:22:10.150
plumbing,
doors,
windows,
plumbing.
This is the type of guy.

352
00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:15.100
Again,
I'm a very handy guy and uh,
I love to build you.
Whatever you want.

353
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:19.630
Add anything.
How about a future?
I hope this video doesn't scare you.

354
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:25.060
That's how it goes.
Everybody else's blog and I look forward.

355
00:22:25.061 --> 00:22:29.170
I'm going out to dinner with you.
All right,
so let's make it happen.

356
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:34.930
Oh Chow.
But either with double negative on the sign off.

357
00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.420
He knows he slipped on the diving board,

358
00:22:37.421 --> 00:22:41.210
hit his head and fell in two of them on the way out of that dot.
Oh,

359
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.110
of course he's doing,
you know why?

360
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:48.910
Cause he ran this by a bunch of people first and all said,
don't fucking do it.

361
00:22:48.911 --> 00:22:52.600
Like three,
three,
three guy friends.
He was like,
what do you guys know?

362
00:22:52.601 --> 00:22:56.020
You're fucking single.
I'm sitting here talking to you idiots.
I'm doing it well.

363
00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:57.430
I'm so happy I can show you this.

364
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:03.070
I have a lot more sympathy for him right now.
Why?

365
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:06.970
I just feel every time I see it I feel I feel worse and worse for him.

366
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.810
You know what I mean?
Like cause I get the impulse he's still single.
Yeah.

367
00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:16.840
Cause like I see the desperation and wants so badly to have love and he just

368
00:23:17.381 --> 00:23:20.500
doesn't know that you gotta be cool in the beginning.
Let's see.

369
00:23:20.501 --> 00:23:23.390
That's the thing is he thinks that is cool.
Fine.

370
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:28.510
But here's the other thing again,
hang on.
Just want to say good morning.

371
00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:33.040
I'm like,
this is her to her again.
Please say it's the next day.

372
00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:36.970
My soon to be my everything

373
00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:44.800
that now it's getting weird driving their truck.

374
00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:46.010
Now it's getting,

375
00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:50.120
the first video is excusable.

376
00:23:50.121 --> 00:23:54.530
The second one when she doesn't respond is like,
oh she might've been

377
00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:02.090
and that's how he's thinking right now.
How do you feel about this?
Oh Christ,

378
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:10.490
three months and then pretty high.

379
00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:19.980
Wait,
is that really him?
Just sending guy.

380
00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:25.250
I was going to say he got busted on college town and I met another girl,

381
00:24:25.521 --> 00:24:29.290
Julia.
My name is Tricia.
Tricia.

382
00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.240
Tricia is boyfriend,
big

383
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:43.670
Toronto.
It's a full break.

384
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:47.480
Julia,
what you need right now,

385
00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:51.540
Julio full Bree took down all come and joy

386
00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:56.010
everyday.
Julie fags down

387
00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:01.190
in a garbage.
Julia.

388
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:05.110
I lost 73 pounds

389
00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:22.560
guys killing it.

390
00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:31.900
It's been there too.
It started to Yellow Cup

391
00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:38.780
on the card.
Is that how he saw it to a cop?
Come over.

392
00:25:38.781 --> 00:25:40.370
If I can shammy try out.

393
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:44.750
That's the one I know,
man.

394
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:50.960
It's so God damn funny.
Even just on Instagram,

395
00:25:50.961 --> 00:25:55.420
the photo shops we've been getting have Garth Garth Brooks shit is,

396
00:25:56.450 --> 00:26:01.400
I know someone in his team has had,
I'm a Garth Brooks fan.

397
00:26:01.401 --> 00:26:04.430
Like legit.
I am a Garth.
Oh,

398
00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:10.640
also I love shameless.
I love much too young to be this damn old.

399
00:26:10.641 --> 00:26:15.220
I like those.
Garth.
Chris Gaines.

400
00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:19.360
I don't dislike Chris game.
Are you serious?
No,
I dislike,

401
00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:24.550
I don't like his alter ego,
but I do like his haircut.
That's cute.

402
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:29.720
Oh,
it looks good on Christine's after.
Let me,
I gotta get back.

403
00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:32.070
But there's no way he hasn't heard this.
Something.

404
00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:36.710
Can we address what quickly before we move along?

405
00:26:36.711 --> 00:26:40.350
Is that the last time we recorded this show we were under threat.
Oh yeah.

406
00:26:40.351 --> 00:26:44.790
We're just such a hassle
because it was a real panic.
Yeah.

407
00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:48.150
Can we address that with the audience?
I feel like we just all over the place.

408
00:26:48.151 --> 00:26:51.510
Sorry.
Yeah.
Sorry guys.
We've been recording this out of sequence.

409
00:26:51.511 --> 00:26:56.280
That's why we just see now,
obviously we're back.
Everything's fine.
Uh,

410
00:26:56.281 --> 00:26:59.920
it was,
it was a little bit of chaos for him.
It was a panic and we were terrible.

411
00:26:59.921 --> 00:27:04.310
When we live,
we live fairly close to like the,
for instance,
uh,

412
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:07.710
an exit,
one exit past us,

413
00:27:07.711 --> 00:27:12.410
two exits past us was shutdown and it was coming like the wind was moving it.

414
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:17.250
Where you officially an evacuation?
We had a voluntary,
so they were,

415
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.720
but they weren't like you have to,

416
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.770
but I mean this neighborhood basically emptied out,
you know?
Well,

417
00:27:22.771 --> 00:27:27.090
and if you wait for them to tell you to go online and their babies,

418
00:27:27.091 --> 00:27:30.610
we've got two young men and Tom Travels and so I was like,

419
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:32.770
let's just fucking go anyways.

420
00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:37.230
So the amount of relief I saw on her face when I was like,
yeah,
yeah,

421
00:27:37.231 --> 00:27:38.190
let's just go.
She was like,

422
00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:42.690
oh well there was raining down ashes and it was really smokey too.
Anyway,

423
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:45.040
we're back.
We're back.
We're fine,
everything's fine.

424
00:27:45.041 --> 00:27:47.640
And thank you for all your kind tweets and your comments and stuff.

425
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:51.570
This is what's hilarious.
It's scary.
I was in that one right there in the canyon.

426
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.770
Where are you used to live?

427
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:56.870
Remember that one caught on fire on a year and we got the um,

428
00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:00.300
it was like an amber alert style text on blast it on our phones.

429
00:28:00.301 --> 00:28:04.590
It said you are officially on the line of evacuation.
You,

430
00:28:04.591 --> 00:28:08.940
it's a voluntary one.
But if it creeps any farther south of like sunset,

431
00:28:08.941 --> 00:28:12.570
then you have to go.
And it was ash everywhere and we got out.
It was scary.

432
00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:15.150
That lady drew it looked like Armageddon going through there.

433
00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:19.140
Joe's Joe's was mandatory.
And here's what's crazy.
Neighbors of his,

434
00:28:19.141 --> 00:28:21.870
their house burned down.
It did.
[inaudible] and,

435
00:28:21.871 --> 00:28:25.080
but he also had neighbors that stayed home.
And I'm like,
what?
I'm like,

436
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:28.620
if you're multiple houses are burning down.
And then he's like,

437
00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:30.420
there's neighbors that were like,
yeah,
just sticking it out.

438
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:32.720
I didn't even tell you today.
I took our,

439
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:37.560
our tiny jeans to the doctor today for his four month.
Yeah.
Appointment driving,

440
00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:42.300
driving up north.
I haven't driven,
it's all black.
Yeah.
Everything's burned up,

441
00:28:42.301 --> 00:28:46.110
man and houses and everything's just gone.
It's,
it's fucking crazy.

442
00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:49.200
It's like the apocalypse going north from here.
So really scary.

443
00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:54.240
And it's exactly like two exits.
Anyways,
we're here.
So this is Garth Instagram.

444
00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.690

Here you go.
It's a nice smile,

467
00:30:29.621 --> 00:30:33.350
Garth.
I know that they're all saying it from here.
Nope,

468
00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:38.050
Tom is,

I love it too.
Let's do the,
yeah,
you're right.

471
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:46.540
Somebody like in his marketing teams,

472
00:30:46.541 --> 00:30:49.150
like definitely there's someone paid and read that.

473
00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:52.660
What if we could get Garth Brooks to call it on the show?
You know,

474
00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:57.550
we got Gloria Stefan to conduct because of our bombardment on Twitter.

475
00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.320
He's got her,
hey,
I don't kill people.
Like you got to say I do.

476
00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:07.630
I Dunno.
Maybe we could start a campaign maybe.
What do you think?

477
00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:09.580
I mean this is kind of its own campaign,
right?

478
00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:13.110
<v 11>Uh,
yeah.</v>

479
00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:18.480
I'm making this video that when you wake up this morning,

480
00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:20.490
the trunk of my car,

481
00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:29.460

just like I fixed my house,

482
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:34.020
I fixed your water heater.
I'm going to fix you too.

483
00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.830
And if you keep making noise back there,

484
00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:40.970
I'm going to drive food.
Tridell

485
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:46.690

488
00:32:02.261 --> 00:32:03.190

I want to varnish you and keep you in my barn.

490

I have lots of ventilation in this whole place.

492
00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:23.340
Just think you'll never think of your ex again for the rest of your life,

493
00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:28.800
so come be with me Julia.

<v 12>Good afternoon Julie.</v>

498
00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:51.170
I just want to say one of the most beautiful times in my life,

499
00:32:51.171 --> 00:32:52.970
hanging out with you last night.

500
00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:58.220
We want to show you here what built it all myself

501
00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:05.630
sand over here.
I put in the whole playground.
I planted the trees.

502
00:33:05.631 --> 00:33:10.140
That's a kind of guy you're going to get and we will take you to dinner tomorrow

503
00:33:10.141 --> 00:33:12.890
at Barney's.
Let's do it.
This called full throttle.

504
00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:16.653

506
00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:28.440
I just wanted to say that that conversation that we had the other night was the

507
00:33:28.441 --> 00:33:31.590
best 23 minutes of my life.
From then on,

508
00:33:31.591 --> 00:33:34.530
I knew that you and I were meant to be together.

509
00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.820
I could see myself bringing your around when I'm with the boys,

510
00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:44.600
maybe introducing you to the seventh floor crew that you see this light.

511
00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:51.120
I started myself sometimes when I sit and stare at it for hours on end,

512
00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:56.370
it just reminds me of me and you'll turned on and lights up my life.

513
00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:00.710
Oh God.
Let you make the distinction of whose hope he does a great goal.

Just to race.
And from your memory.
You never gonna see him again.

522
00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:39.010
He's in my trunk is dead type of guy again.

523
00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:46.950
Love that.
That's my favorite

524
00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:54.910

Check in on your hope.

526
00:34:59.491 --> 00:35:00.960
You're having a great day.

527
00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:06.060
[inaudible] just wanted to say kind of looks like you last night was one of the

528
00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:10.020
best days of my life is so beautiful Julia.
And uh,

529
00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:14.250
any talks or getting back with your ex,
just uh,
put that out of your head.

530
00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.530
You can forget he ever existed

531
00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:23.340
up in a black hefty bags in my garage,
a garage.
I built myself.

532
00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:29.420
Everything from the crown molding to the flows and Nice,

533
00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:38.100
let's do this

534
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.810
<v 13>thing.
Uh,
you know,</v>

535
00:35:39.811 --> 00:35:44.811
please ignore the pictures of my wedding day or anything has to do with my wife

536
00:35:44.941 --> 00:35:46.420

I'll fucking kill.

537
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:57.870
<v 10>Oh God.
Oh God.
These are getting better.</v>

538
00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:03.780
I love our audience so much for these.

539
00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:08.490
I know it starts as a seed and then it grows.

540
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:12.000
But also the guy in the fan stores in a public place doing that.

541
00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:15.420
I mean like a manager could walk by and look the fuck are you doing buddy?

542
00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:21.240
It's so good.
Crown mold,
mold grows up,

543
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:27.610
but the life that this had on buzzfeed,
it didn't have this line.
No,

544
00:36:27.611 --> 00:36:31.560
no,
there's been no Paul's for two years and all of a sudden you all just fucking

545
00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:35.820
Frankenstein all of augur.
Well that's why she reached out.
She was just like,
Hey,

546
00:36:35.821 --> 00:36:36.654
I thought this was,

547
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:39.223
<v 13>you're like,</v>

548
00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:43.970
<v 10>hi Julie.
Uh,
she seems so nice.</v>

549
00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:47.960
She seems that's why he probably fell for all these guys.
Love what happened.

550
00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:51.590
I'll tell you what happened.
I bet you he says that when she was,

551
00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:56.620
and she's like one of those sincere nice people who was like hi and made eye

552
00:36:56.721 --> 00:36:59.780
contact and saw him and was like smiled and he was like,

553
00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:02.720

I'm going to make this lady,
my wife.

554
00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:07.910
She just paid attention to me,
like really gave a normal mistake.

555
00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:12.020
I'm going to make sure I clarify that normal mistake would be like,

556
00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:15.650
cause I made that mistake too when someone's been overly friendly and I'm like,

557
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:20.600
hmm.
Yeah.
But as far as I'll go is to offer my number.

558
00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:24.140
I don't ever ask for,
there's,
I'll give mine,
if you want to call you call.

559
00:37:24.141 --> 00:37:26.720
If you don't,
I,
you know,
you're going to get the fucking point.
You don't,

560
00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:30.440
if she never calls,
you don't fucking send videos.
You know what I'm saying?

561
00:37:30.441 --> 00:37:33.260
Like the normal,
I think,
again,
it's a mistake.

562
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:35.810
That's a lot of times I go with a waitress,

563
00:37:35.811 --> 00:37:38.660
especially their job is to be flurries and you know,

564
00:37:38.661 --> 00:37:43.480
be overly friendly and touchy and all that Shit.
Yeah.
Yeah.

565
00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:47.420
We have a friend that used to go there quite a lot.
Or Hooters.
Yeah.

566
00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:52.280
Three of them.
He was very close to you,
do I to live with you?
Oh yeah.

567
00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:56.330
Oh yeah.
He was a regular,
he was,
he was,

568
00:37:56.331 --> 00:38:00.390
he had a table wait,
taught him and he had regular titty was,
uh,

569
00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:04.900
he was the guy and there's guys like this who at who?

570
00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:07.760
Like I'm the type of person who,
uh,

571
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:12.470
resents the overly friendly waitress in a place,

572
00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.660
like where I know their coach to do it.
I'm like,

573
00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:19.340
I stopped smiling because I feel like it's so contrived.
You know what I mean?

574
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.691
Exactly.

575
00:38:20.691 --> 00:38:23.600
So like when they're like hope yet and then the smiley face on the thing and I'm

576
00:38:23.601 --> 00:38:26.570
like,
all right,
like I'm not,
I'm not a sucker.
Like stop.

577
00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.300
Well the Hooters girl and that's what I'm saying,

578
00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:33.980
fucking treat you like a side.
He's the guy,

579
00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.880
our friend is the guy who's like,

580
00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.470
I think that check really liked he's captain Cevallo.

581
00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:43.300
That's who you like that she's trained to do that.
And he's like,
no,
no.

582
00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:47.980
She put her hand on my arm and she told me if I was,
she's like,

583
00:38:47.981 --> 00:38:51.490
you look happy today or you look sad today.
I was going to cheer you up.
I'm like,

584
00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.910
that's all coached.
You don't know that.
That's cool.
That's a question.

585
00:38:54.911 --> 00:38:56.590
Now hold on.
So this mutual friend,

586
00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:00.100
cause that seems to me to be the guy that's prone to making the good morning

587
00:39:00.101 --> 00:39:03.120
Julia videos.
It's a guide.
I misread the sign.

588
00:39:03.121 --> 00:39:07.210
So did this guy kind of overstep the corny

589
00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:15.700
multiple times?
Uh,
so many times.

590
00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:19.930
I don't know how the,
I don't know how much I should say to be honest,
because,

591
00:39:19.931 --> 00:39:23.620
you know,
uh,
but,
uh,
yes,
he,

592
00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:26.710
um,
well I'll tell this story.

593
00:39:26.711 --> 00:39:30.560
There was one time where he went into the back of,
um,

594
00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:34.930
la weekly and found them a Seuss and then he hit me up,
but he's like,

595
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:39.440
[inaudible] a sous coming over tonight.
I'm like,
Oh yeah,

596
00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:42.430
my neck and back have been bothering me.
I'm like a house house.

597
00:39:42.431 --> 00:39:46.670
Massoud Song Makes House calls.
Yeah.

Just,
you know,

598
00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:50.580
let her in.
I'm like,
okay.
And then she knocks on the door and I opened it up and,

599
00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:53.920
and she's like,
hi.
And I'm like,
are you the misuse?
And she's like,
yeah.

600
00:39:53.921 --> 00:39:57.040
And I'm like,
where's your table?
Where's your chair?

601
00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:01.780
Where's your oil?
Where's your tat you got,
you don't even have a fanny pack on?

602
00:40:01.781 --> 00:40:06.520
Like I've had massage and,
uh,
she's like,
oh,
he's like,
stop stops.

603
00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:10.550
So He lets a pea lesser in,

604
00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:14.770
he lets her head and he uh,
you know,

605
00:40:14.771 --> 00:40:19.771
spends a few hours and then she leaves and I'm no,

606
00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:26.620
no,
that's right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
She doesn't leave.
She uh,

607
00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:31.840
he sends her into my room to take a shower.

608
00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.770
So I,
I had left,
I come back and I'm like,
Hey,
who's in my shower?

609
00:40:35.771 --> 00:40:38.770
He said call the Mizzou.
So I'm like,
what the fuck?
I go,
dude,

610
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:42.670
that's basically a prostitute.
Okay.
No,
she's nice.
I go,

611
00:40:42.671 --> 00:40:45.850
there's a lot of nice prostitutes.
I go,
but my wallet and Shit or like,

612
00:40:45.851 --> 00:40:49.520
what are you doing?
That's my room.
Like personalized.

613
00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:53.890
Couldn't she had a bathroom?
What?
Cause he didn't want her dirty ass in there,

614
00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:57.970
you know?
So I go,
Hey,
I'm beating on my door.
Like,
Yo,

615
00:40:57.971 --> 00:41:01.490
you gotta wrap that shit up and get out,
get out,
got to get out of my bathroom.

616
00:41:01.491 --> 00:41:04.780
And he's like,
don't be like that to her.
I'm like,
he's like,
she's not like that.

617
00:41:04.781 --> 00:41:08.530
I get you just spent an hour and a half with this woman in your room getting a

618
00:41:08.531 --> 00:41:11.260
massage.
What do you mean you don't know a fucking thing about her?

619
00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:13.630
So I do a show on it.

620
00:41:13.631 --> 00:41:17.320
This is back in the Ontario days when you would drive out and back and out and

621
00:41:17.321 --> 00:41:19.000
back.
And on that Saturday night,

622
00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:24.260
remember you did an 11 o'clock show and I was middling.
So I don't,

623
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:28.560
I'm not getting home until one 32 o'clock you know,

624
00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:32.820
and I'm always on an adrenaline high.
Can't fall asleep right away.

625
00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:37.370
So I'm watching some TV and it's about three 30 in the morning at this point.

626
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:42.020
And I see this bedroom light turn on and I hear two voices.

627
00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.240
I'm like,
oh well go for him.
He fucking,

628
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:48.890
he got laid and the door opens up and here comes the Massoud.
I go,

629
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:51.200
<v 14>yeah,</v>

630
00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.600
<v 10>now I go,
what the fuck are you doing?
Well,
I go,</v>

631
00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:59.260
how much did that cost you right now?
How she didn't charge me?
I go,
Bull Shit.

632
00:41:59.261 --> 00:42:04.180
She just wants to get to know me.
That's it.
So does the Yup.

633
00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:09.670
Paid a fuckload.
Okay.
I was at a strip club with him one night.
That's wait,

634
00:42:09.671 --> 00:42:11.470
wait.
But he didn't pay her weight.

635
00:42:11.471 --> 00:42:16.360
So you found out that Romans not coming over for fighters that better one,

636
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:17.463
the Strip club,

637
00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:22.300
the Strip club one was going to a strip club.

638
00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:26.380
Multiple makes it like,
are you going back to the Strip club?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

639
00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:30.820
And then he's like,
I like it.
It's,
it sounds like a good morning Julia

640
00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:35.900
<v 14>thing where Ryan's like how much money have you spent at the Strip club?</v>

641
00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:39.540
And he's like,
in the last couple of days,

642
00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:43.510
<v 10>yeah,
that's what,
yeah,
he had a,
if you have to ask him if there was a clarifier,</v>

643
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:48.370
$800.
Oh my God.
And then

644
00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:52.360
<v 14>he was like beat,
beat,
beat.
But this girl really likes it.</v>

645
00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:57.400
<v 10>Oh No.
Really?
100%.
I went a couple times with them</v>

646
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:59.703
<v 14>and um,</v>

647
00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:03.280
<v 10>uh,
he's like,
I'm going to go in the back with this girl.
I'm like,
okay.</v>

648
00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:06.660
And you just go get a,
you know,
you got to get a lap dance or whatever,

649
00:43:06.661 --> 00:43:10.530
but those girls are fucking be straight up with you.
Like for a couple of bucks,

650
00:43:10.531 --> 00:43:15.180
you know,
we can work some shit out.
So he was gone.
I mean,

651
00:43:15.181 --> 00:43:18.270
it was a while.
And then finally I was like,
well fuck this.
I want it.

652
00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:19.470
This is how long he was gone.

653
00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:23.490
He was gone for like 30 minutes and I was just sitting in a strip club by
myself,

654
00:43:23.491 --> 00:43:27.270
which I always think is creepy.
Anyway,
so I'm like,
well fuck,

655
00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:29.340
I got a joint in the car.
So I go out to the parking lot.

656
00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:34.140
I smoke an entire join by myself.
Okay.
I'm out there for a good 2030 minutes.

657
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:36.660
I go back in,
he's still not back.

658
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:40.980
And then when he finally does show up like another 30 minutes later,

659
00:43:40.981 --> 00:43:44.730
he comes from behind me and I know that's where the ATM is.

660
00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.280
And I go,
what the fuck,
man?
I said,

661
00:43:47.281 --> 00:43:51.000
I thought maybe you crossed the line and they were back there fucking you up.

662
00:43:51.001 --> 00:43:52.620
I didn't know,
but I can't get back there.

663
00:43:52.621 --> 00:43:57.330
I didn't know what was going on and hear from you.
Well,
here's what happened.

664
00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.420
She likes,
she likes me.
No,

665
00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:04.800
he said that he can't come from head.

666
00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:09.630
So he's paying for a blow job,
but he can't tell her,

667
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:12.300
hey,
this doesn't really work on me.

668
00:44:12.301 --> 00:44:14.700
So he's being overly polite letting her do this,

669
00:44:14.701 --> 00:44:19.380
cause he doesn't want to stop her.
What he forgets is that you also have,

670
00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:22.870
you're paying for the dance per song,
right.

671
00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:25.500
He's back there for like six fucking songs more.

672
00:44:25.501 --> 00:44:30.501
So he's paying the dance plus fees for drove?

673
00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:32.000
Yeah.
Why is he

674
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.460
<v 4>just Jag?
I Dunno.
Let's see.
I'm looking into it.</v>

675
00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:38.880
So we should ask them.
Hey,
can we pull up his,
that's what it was.
It was like,

676
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:43.590
it was like a $1,200 a night.
Oh my God.
You got about the fucking,

677
00:44:43.591 --> 00:44:46.080
I have my God,

678
00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:48.750
<v 0>why is it told me?
I don't know if there's somebody,
we all know.</v>

679
00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:53.520
Somebody told me a story about 1200 years being at a strip club.

680
00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.650
I gotta be a stripper.
I know.
Being a strip.
No.

681
00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:00.600
And talking to somebody like talking to the girl.
He just like,

682
00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:05.610
I'm here.
You're there.
Yeah.
And he was just like,
it just went on and on.

683
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:06.630
Just kept talking.

684
00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:12.240
And then after 20 or 30 minutes he was like,
all right,

685
00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:15.360
you know it's going to go over here now talk to somebody else.
And they're like,

686
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:19.500
Whoa,
whoa girls like you owe me like 600 bucks.

687
00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:22.980
Cause that was like six songs.
And he was like,
he was like,
I didn't know

688
00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:26.650
<v 4>talking to her for her time,</v>

689
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:34.430
she was saying that it was that he was talking to her in an area called the boy.

690
00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.550
He was in the bullpen.
He was in the boat.
If you talked to her over there,

691
00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:39.730
it's all right.
It's up to her.

692
00:45:39.731 --> 00:45:44.290
It's up to her eyes over here and that means you're wow.
He got like,

693
00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:48.100
you know,
then they security can cause I'm not paying you fucking die.
I,

694
00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:51.870
it's not fair.
If you're not made aware of that policy beforehand,
is it?
I mean,

695
00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:55.300
well of course not.
Yeah.
If it's a range then it's a rain.
Yeah.

696
00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:58.870
She should tell him,
hey dude,
you do you mind?
This is what the deal is.

697
00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:03.160
This is the money seat.
Yeah.
Bikes.
So that's,
he would have conversation.

698
00:46:03.161 --> 00:46:06.970
He got to know all their real names.
All their real names,
which by the way,

699
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.290
isn't their real name?
They've got three.
I'm Tyson.
Okay.
What's your real name?

700
00:46:11.291 --> 00:46:14.380
Chanel.
It's probably Jennifer.
Right.
You know what I mean?
It's none of those.

701
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:18.610
And he would tell them all the time,
his line was,
you're better than this.

702
00:46:18.611 --> 00:46:22.000
He would say that to these girls.
And they were like,
no,
I'm not.

703
00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:26.160
I'm making a ton of fucking money.
Right.

704
00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:30.340
I want to do this.
He wants to save everyone.
This is a perfect,
yeah.

705
00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:34.740
<v 0>Time to say I,
I got a message,
uh,
this week from the a stripper,
uh,</v>

706
00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:38.030
the emailed.
Hey Tom,
I'm a huge fan of yours at Christina's.
I'm a stripper.

707
00:46:38.031 --> 00:46:40.910
I really love your comments on these weird try it out type guys.

708
00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:42.080
I have a story for you guys.

709
00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:46.790
This past weekend I had a customer come in who is really into castration,
um,

710
00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:49.310
and I was wearing a plaid outfit.
I guess this will make sense.

711
00:46:49.311 --> 00:46:53.960
He ended up getting a lap dance.
Uh,
but elap dance is not what he wanted.

712
00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:58.190
He laid on the floor in the lab room and the lap dance room asked me to stomp on

713
00:46:58.191 --> 00:47:01.010
his balls with my sharp stripper heels.

714
00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:05.690
Great Wild role playing as a farm girl who's going to castrate her least

715
00:47:05.691 --> 00:47:08.600
favorite bowl.
Okay.
I wish I had a video of this conference.

716
00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:15.960
<v 4>That sounds amazing.
It so I love that,
by the way.</v>

717
00:47:15.961 --> 00:47:19.500
Good for her.
See that's,
but that's why it's good to be a stripper.
He didn't,

718
00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:23.810
she didn't have to have sex with him,
right?
She said,
no,
she's,
she's great.

719
00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:26.880
Stomped on his nuts.
That's what I'm always saying is like the fart videos,

720
00:47:26.881 --> 00:47:30.040
the nut crushing stuff.
That's easy money.
That's money on the table if

721
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.570
<v 3>you're a woman and not doing those things.</v>

722
00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:35.500
Now let's talk about the psychology behind the guy that does the good morning

723
00:47:35.501 --> 00:47:38.440
Julia and,
and the $1,200 a stripper.

724
00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:40.910
What's going on with him?
You,

725
00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:43.660
you started to say a little bit that you think it's the,

726
00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:45.010
he wants to rescue these.
Yeah,

727
00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:49.080
<v 10>he feels,
I think that makes him feel good.
You know what I mean?
Like,</v>

728
00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:54.300
but here's the other thing,
it's,
it's,
it's complex because after that night,

729
00:47:54.301 --> 00:47:56.880
after he was in the back,
that was the first time he'd been with someone.

730
00:47:56.881 --> 00:47:59.370
He got in the car and he just took a deep breath and he looked at me,

731
00:47:59.371 --> 00:48:01.140
he started getting them [inaudible].
He's like,

732
00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:05.700
I think she was a prostitute.
I said,

733
00:48:05.701 --> 00:48:10.350
she gave her money for a sexual favor.
Like she's a prostitute.

734
00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:13.990
That's the definite,
and he was upset with himself.
He was,

735
00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:17.100
because he felt he was better than that.
You're not.
You see what I'm saying?

736
00:48:17.101 --> 00:48:21.320
Like now he's putting it off like,
no,
no,
I,
I'm better than that.
I can,
um,

737
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:23.100
I'm now one of those people.
I'm like,

738
00:48:23.101 --> 00:48:26.100
they're the people you shit on all the time.
That's who you are.
You know?

739
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:32.160
I really do think that that particular person we're talking about,

740
00:48:32.161 --> 00:48:35.610
and this guy too,
he wants a,
here's what he's saying.
Look,
look at all I can do.

741
00:48:35.611 --> 00:48:39.030
I can provide for you.
I can take care of you.
I can protect you.

742
00:48:39.031 --> 00:48:43.800
I can love you like no one else ever has.
And I know that because we,

743
00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:46.970
I saw your name on a cup.
I'm like,

744
00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:51.780
you give a dental update gene.
Um,
I've actually been doing all right,

745
00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:55.950
<v 3>hang on,
let me see.
No,
I think theory a little yellowy yet.
Have you been,</v>

746
00:48:55.951 --> 00:48:59.400
I'm rushing.
Um,
yeah,
I've been brushing,

747
00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.530
I'll tell you dental update for two year old.

748
00:49:01.531 --> 00:49:05.070
I took him to the dentist last time and uh,
and the lady goes,

749
00:49:05.071 --> 00:49:07.740
you need to see the dentist goes,
you need to start flossing.

750
00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:10.740
I go flossing my two year old.
She goes,
yeah.
I go,

751
00:49:10.741 --> 00:49:14.310
well how do you suggest I do that?
She goes,
well,
I hold my son down.

752
00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:18.360
I just hold him down and he screams and I just go ahead and floss as he screams.

753
00:49:18.361 --> 00:49:21.550
I'm like,
I'm pretty sure that's not the way it's the way to do it.

754
00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:24.300
Your children at first dentist visit was horrific.

755
00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:27.800
<v 10>Relayed in like the tax lap.
He was like,
ah,</v>

756
00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:32.430
need to shoot.
But our dentist office has,
um,

757
00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:35.520
it's how he found a movie.
Trolls.
I'd never seen it before.

758
00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:39.080
They lay the chair back and they put us a TV on the ceiling.

759
00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:43.250
The kids can watch them felt we could do it now.
Yeah.
And uh,
yeah,
that was,

760
00:49:43.251 --> 00:49:47.600
she was not having that either,
by the way.
Yeah.
How are your teeth?
I mean,

761
00:49:47.601 --> 00:49:50.210
I've been to cal Ripken have good teeth for years and years.
Guys.

762
00:49:50.211 --> 00:49:54.350
I've had my thi let me say it.
Yeah,

I to get my first give now look,

763
00:49:54.351 --> 00:49:55.670
there was a lot of work done to them,

764
00:49:55.671 --> 00:50:00.270
but I didn't get my first cavity until I'm 45 42 Gotcha.

765
00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:04.550
You're 45 yup.
Parts like six years older than you.

766
00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.920
Kreischer yeah,
he looks it.
Yeah.

767
00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:11.180
You're like 15 or in all of it coming up on 60 play.

768
00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:15.220
Do you think I look like,
oh,
see guy or show low with my flannel.

769
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:16.490
Christina's me now I saw the,

770
00:50:16.491 --> 00:50:20.510
I saw your shirts the other day was kind of fucked up.
I'm going to go,
oh,

771
00:50:20.511 --> 00:50:25.370
see guy a black on black truck with blacked out windows.
Yes.

772
00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:28.040
Yeah.
Like a raptor.
Yeah,

773
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.530
<v 4>yeah.
Like a Ford Raptor at Tahoe Tahoe,</v>

774
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:35.630
one of those desert trucks that you can tell your motorcycles out.
Yeah.

775
00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:38.810
One of those guys,
he goes to the Salton Sea,
come over for the Q dog.

776
00:50:38.811 --> 00:50:41.270
He probably got really long shorts and socks.

777
00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:44.430
You probably got this much skin showing on your leg.
You know,

778
00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:52.160
you drink a lot of like energy drinks and shit.
Hold on.

779
00:50:52.161 --> 00:50:55.640
I want to bring up one thing before we go forwards.
This is kind of a big draw.

780
00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.450
Our dear friend,
you know him,
Eric Lundy.

781
00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:02.660
Remember this guy used to write cartoons with back.

782
00:51:02.661 --> 00:51:07.070
He and I used to work writing children's stuff together for years.
Anyways,

783
00:51:07.071 --> 00:51:08.990
he moved back to Kansas City for the last few years.

784
00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:13.970
Has been working on a comic called hollow leg and he spent years.

785
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.150
It's crazy.
I've dedicated this guy is to this.
I mean I'm serious.

786
00:51:17.151 --> 00:51:22.151
The level of the time and commitment and the artistic craft building.

787
00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:27.620
Um,

He's a fantastic writer and he taught himself how to draw.
It's unreal.

800
00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:13.281

at checkout.</v>

821
00:53:30.810 --> 00:53:35.810
That's merchant method.com/tom Segura and it's all there now and the Christmas

822
00:53:36.421 --> 00:53:36.931
sales going.

823
00:53:36.931 --> 00:53:41.550
And this year we're going to be supporting a starlight children's foundation as

824
00:53:41.551 --> 00:53:46.500
our chair.
The uh,
right.
Uh,
that's good.
We think of this gene.

825
00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:47.870
Watch this,

826
00:53:51.350 --> 00:53:55.650
<v 2>this person
on the plane</v>

827
00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:01.760
<v 0>guy looking around.
I mean,
I mean seriously.</v>

828
00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:06.790
Isn't that unbelievable?
Look at that.
Look at this dude.
Look,
this dude toss,
uh,

829
00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:09.900
his look around.
This is my favorite part of this.
He's like

830
00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:17.310
<v 2>this guy right here
in this shit,</v>

831
00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.153
man.

832
00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:20.180
<v 0>Nasty.
Oh,</v>

833
00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:24.900
she's pushing on her vagina particles and particles throughout the plane.

834
00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:29.860
It's not okay.
Isn't that people do nasty shit.
Nasty Shit.
Yeah.

835
00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:35.520
Bare feet always freak out when you find it here.
Yeah.

836
00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:37.770
When they put it on your fucking serious.
Yeah.

837
00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:41.270
I've seen a lot of people texting shit,
pick their feet,

838
00:54:41.271 --> 00:54:45.300
picked up diapers now special that I'm a parent.
I look for that shit.

839
00:54:45.301 --> 00:54:46.440
I seen diapers rolled up,

840
00:54:46.441 --> 00:54:48.750
just left on to seat and when they get out of the plane,
I'm like,

841
00:54:48.751 --> 00:54:49.584
you fucking pig.

842
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:54.050
<v 15>Just feels hell.
A Red table.
Talk family back in Baltimore.</v>

843
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:57.530
It's going to be a difficult,
sensitive topic.

844
00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:02.680
We are going to be talking about race and racial relations between women and

845
00:55:06.310 --> 00:55:08.000
ain't gon be easy.
No,

846
00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:11.420
cause you and I've already had some conversations that we've gotten pretty tight

847
00:55:11.421 --> 00:55:15.280
about.
Yeah.
I'm really talking about all that biases because the sad part is,

848
00:55:15.281 --> 00:55:19.040
is that I realize I've got some serious prejudices and biases myself.

849
00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:23.120
So there's a racial divide between women of color and white women.

850
00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:28.280
We don't talk about it much,
but it's real and it's deep.
Any comment about race?

851
00:55:28.281 --> 00:55:30.950
No matter how well intentioned can set off a firestorm,

852
00:55:30.951 --> 00:55:34.590
which scares people away from even talking about the issue.
Now,

853
00:55:34.591 --> 00:55:39.591
one about this Ms. Dean that really breaks my heart is that white women

854
00:55:41.330 --> 00:55:46.330
understand what it feels to be oppressed because what it feels to exactly

855
00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:47.810
because of their sex,

856
00:55:47.811 --> 00:55:52.790
what it feels to be ostracized or not being treated as an equal.

857
00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:56.870
Right.
You know what?
I found this,
this quote,
I'm gonna read it.

858
00:55:57.170 --> 00:56:01.520
Prejudice is the emotional commitment to ignorance.
Hmm.
Well,

859
00:56:01.521 --> 00:56:05.420
I have to admit I'm guilty because I do have my own biases,

860
00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:10.430
specifically with blonde women.
Blonde hair on white women just triggers me

861
00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:14.650
<v 0>blonde hair.
She has blonde hair.
I know both those ladies have blocked her mom.</v>

862
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:16.990
Her mom looks damn good.
So

863
00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:21.740
that's why she cleared it up cause she goes blown with and her mom was like,
Huh,

864
00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:24.300
okay.

865
00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:28.230
<v 15>Is that dude nine old biases specifically with blonde women?</v>

866
00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:32.040
Blonde hair on white women just triggers me.
Okay.

867
00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:35.320
<v 4>Yeah.
I knew I had something special with Jadah.
I knew it.
Yeah.</v>

868
00:56:35.610 --> 00:56:39.440
She and I would be natural enemies apparently.
I guess so.
Damn.

869
00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:39.850
<v 15>You know,</v>

870
00:56:39.850 --> 00:56:44.850
and I've had a specific incident with someone who has blonde hair.

871
00:56:45.521 --> 00:56:46.450
Absolutely.

872
00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:51.570
All throughout my childhood I do remember experiencing being teased by white

873
00:56:52.031 --> 00:56:54.310
women in regards to my hair,

874
00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:58.780
how I looked and I feeling belittled.

875
00:56:59.390 --> 00:57:00.680
<v 4>I think it's always interesting though,</v>

876
00:57:00.681 --> 00:57:04.280
when someone's like the way I looked and there literally like a perfect looking

877
00:57:04.281 --> 00:57:07.880
human being.
She's gorgeous.
Gorgeous.
Yes.
She's fallen

878
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:14.940
face.
Okay.
Well,
I mean I believe her,
but she hates Wiley's blip,

879
00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:19.730
blonde hair.
She was like,
you know,
I hate like I get triggered by it.

880
00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:24.400
White women with blonde hair,
Christina P,
other people.
She just said,

881
00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:26.870
I hate her so much.

882
00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:31.190
I love that there is a love to like if someone that big hate you,

883
00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:34.010
you got to support that.
Are you kidding me?
That'd be awesome.

884
00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:39.350
Thank you for the fact that you enough that you hate me.
I didn't realize.

885
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:44.450
Hmm.
Um,
yeah.
Yeah.
We have a prank call that came in from Fort Simpson.
Cool.

886
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:47.930
I love that.
This might've been Halloween one.

887
00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:51.960
<v 16>Thank you for calling.
How can I help you?</v>

888
00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:56.390
<v 17>Well,

Hello.
How are you?
Oh,</v>

889
00:57:56.391 --> 00:58:01.391
just moved into this house but two weeks ago there's been a lot of weird things

890
00:58:02.001 --> 00:58:04.480
happen.
This is how I moved into this place.

891
00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:08.630
I've been talking with different people around town.

892
00:58:08.631 --> 00:58:12.140
They've been told me about different ghosts in this house.

893
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:15.740
<v 16>Are you trying to get rid of those like spirits in your house?</v>

894
00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:20.690
<v 17>They told me about this woman that used to kill Moose or something,</v>

895
00:58:20.691 --> 00:58:24.260
mark it and then make soup on level.
Okay.

896
00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:29.030
Litter was also a guy that used to let strangers sexually abusive,

897
00:58:29.031 --> 00:58:32.280
so they live in his house.
Um,
awesome.

898
00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:35.690
Heard about a guy that used to smoke meth with his brother,

899
00:58:35.790 --> 00:58:39.050
labeled do sick and disgusting things.
The

900
00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:46.160
Chinese shut up told me this Asian massage therapist

901
00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:51.710
like committed suicide in the house.
Something like that.

902
00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:55.710
<v 16>Okay.
Have you seen her?</v>

903
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:57.770
What kinds of things have you heard?

904
00:58:58.130 --> 00:59:02.470
<v 17>Just a cabinet doors come open.
Things fall out the covers.</v>

905
00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:06.010
Okay.
Um,

906
00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:09.370

Help me some of these spirits right now.
Okay.

908
00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:16.000
Fair to say.

right.

918
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:05.790
<v 17>Bitter.
It's are you with us asking if you can live in peace spirits?</v>

919
01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.640
Are you here to harm us in any way?

920
01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:12.810
Ghost.

Say that again.

925
01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:36.333
<v 6>Oh.</v>

926
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:43.970
Starting to feel Saltman side down.

927
01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:48.920
<v 17>Whoa.
What's going on?
Get it now.
I feel like something's inside me now.</v>

928
01:00:48.921 --> 01:00:49.850
Feel all this hate.

929
01:00:50.050 --> 01:00:53.180
<v 2>Oh,

930
01:00:55.890 --> 01:00:57.100

<v 17>Hell.

What the hell?
Just happened.
What just happened?

935
01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:22.930
I just woke up covered mile feces.

938
01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:33.090
<v 17>I'm scared.

01:01:38.530 --> 01:01:42.370
<v 17>Alright.
We're all guessing.
It looks like these spirits are here to stay.</v>

942
01:01:42.670 --> 01:01:44.200
I appreciate all your help.

943

Absolutely.
All right.</v>

<v 6>Oh my God.
Um,</v>

949
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:06.460
<v 4>last thing I wanted to show you because Christina was really into this.</v>

950
01:02:07.050 --> 01:02:10.690
Do you like that?
Jane is upset with me.
She hates you.
I hate that.

951
01:02:10.691 --> 01:02:14.410
I love her so much.
And I,
I watch red table talk on Facebook.

952
01:02:14.411 --> 01:02:17.080
I don't know if you've seen it.
I do.
I'm a giant pink Pinkett Smith Fan.

953
01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:18.490
Oh my God,
it's so good.

954
01:02:18.491 --> 01:02:21.780
They talk about everything to just worry about being Jadah.
I know.

955
01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:23.393
That's really weird.

956
01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:24.913
<v 2>Oh my God.</v>

957
01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.193
<v 18>Hello?</v>

958
01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:50.090
<v 4>Oh,
when you fall and cannot get a</v>

959
01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:53.340
tragic at Eric

960
01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:59.090
and I can't get up these days.
Yeah.
Terror.
So we were in a hotel room,

961
01:02:59.091 --> 01:03:00.410
was it during the evacuation?

962
01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:05.390
Ab and we were watching television and this comes on and I'm like,
oh my God.

963
01:03:05.391 --> 01:03:10.090
That's the most horrifying thing I've ever seen.
Like the whole cheesy,
I fallen.

964
01:03:10.110 --> 01:03:13.220
I can't get up as an enough now.
It's horrifying now.

965
01:03:13.221 --> 01:03:14.960
Now you're putting an image in,
in,

966
01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:18.290
in children's heads of their older parents who are home alone.

967
01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:24.020
So dark.
Oh my God.
That was terrifying.

968
01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:29.680
Yeah,
it's going to die.
He's down there.
I mean the price low,

969
01:03:29.681 --> 01:03:33.910
like the slow build and you're like,
what is,
this is terrifying.

970
01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:36.220
I don't know what,
you know what?

971
01:03:36.221 --> 01:03:38.760
I didn't know what the fuck are you guys are about to show me.
And this is the,

972
01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:42.790
this is a legit thing.
Yeah,
it's real.
This is where grandma lives.

973
01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:46.360
I know grandma.
Yeah,

974
01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:51.220
she's down there weeping a lot.
Oddly.
Slip and falls.
We all know.

975
01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:53.000
You know what I'm saying?
Grandma got from scratch,

976
01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:57.910
which might be gaining the system.
Ah,
look at this.
It's a nice tube,

977
01:03:58.030 --> 01:04:02.890
two story house and then she's down there crying down.
[inaudible] sweet Nana.

978
01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:06.740
No,
I thought she was face down too,
but I see it now.
She's faced.
Yeah,

979
01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:11.410
I at first time I saw it I was like man,
but see her nose and mouth.
Yeah,
no,

980
01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:14.140
she can breathe them screen.
Yeah.
She's like,
look,

981
01:04:14.141 --> 01:04:16.720
if you guys are going to let have me lay here 10 hours on Monday,

982
01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:19.300
I don't remember.
I think it was dumb bitch though.

983
01:04:19.301 --> 01:04:22.540
She was carrying your laundry and then her ship fell.

984
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:23.680
Maybe she didn't carry that along.

985
01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:24.953
<v 18>Great.</v>

986
01:04:27.090 --> 01:04:29.790
<v 4>And right off to the side here,
somebody is going to be like,
Eh,</v>

987
01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:34.860
we got it Linda.
We got it now.
You're right.
Okay.
You want it.

988
01:04:34.861 --> 01:04:38.220
Can I tell you about a gaming,
the Sizzler,
good game in the system.

989
01:04:38.221 --> 01:04:40.530
Not just learned in Baltimore.
I was there and this is,

990
01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:44.490
I'm proud and not proud at the same time.
Yeah.

991
01:04:44.491 --> 01:04:48.270
So the racket that I haven't seen here with these limes scooters and these birds

992
01:04:48.271 --> 01:04:53.271
scooters in Baltimore city is these inner city kids when you're just out there

993
01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:56.730
toward Harvard Shit,
they run up to it,

994
01:04:56.731 --> 01:04:59.880
he push you off of it and then they take it because it's on your dime and

995
01:04:59.890 --> 01:05:04.500
however much,
oh my God,
maybe it was ride it until this shit runs out.

996
01:05:04.501 --> 01:05:06.690
And then you know where they throw him in the harbor.

997
01:05:06.691 --> 01:05:09.150
So they had to start taking them away.
Cause if don't them in the harbor.

998
01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:13.180
Oh my God.
So there's a bike share program.
Um,

999
01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:17.740
and Baltimore city is the only city in the world that partakes in this bike

1000
01:05:17.741 --> 01:05:20.680
share program that doesn't want to share the fog and bikes.

1001
01:05:20.681 --> 01:05:25.240
They stole every bike.
Okay.
They're all gone.
So they created something,

1002
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:27.400
again,
it's called the Baltimore Lock.

1003
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:30.520
It's the only city in the world doing this and that didn't work.

1004
01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:34.620
And now the bike share program,
it's gone because the bikes are gone.

1005
01:05:35.410 --> 01:05:37.020
Oh by God,
volleyball

1006
01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:43.750
or hustling down there.
Man,
I got something.

1007
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:48.960
I keep coughing.
I got aids and maybe do something.

1008
01:05:49.890 --> 01:05:52.870
Um,
sickle cell,

1009
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.090
you're going to be working with us pretty soon,
man.
We're going to be,

1010
01:05:56.091 --> 01:06:00.490
we're working on this project with a new studio and we'll be putting out

1011
01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:04.630
podcasts and years going to be one of them is first of all,

1012
01:06:04.631 --> 01:06:09.100
thank you for having me.
I'm starting to be a part of your,
uh,
can we,

1013
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:12.340
can we talk about it full on like your network is,
am I allowed to say that?

1014
01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:13.211
I don't know what it's called.

1015
01:06:13.211 --> 01:06:16.180
I just know we're gonna be producing podcasts and trying to put out content.

1016
01:06:16.270 --> 01:06:21.160
Glad to be under the umbrella play.
It'd be fun.
I'm stoked for it.
I really am.

1017
01:06:21.161 --> 01:06:25.150
The girl,
by the way,
we'll know is just that like you'll sign on,
you know,

1018
01:06:25.151 --> 01:06:27.090
whatever you subscribe to podcasts.

1019
01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:32.100
But also on our video channel you just have like a full new show or you know,

1020
01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.480
we'll try to get you something five days a week,
you know,

1021
01:06:34.481 --> 01:06:38.860
so it's not us five days a week.
No,
no.
Just something that like is,
you know,

1022
01:06:38.890 --> 01:06:41.410
related days,
Ryan show and then we'll have,

1023
01:06:41.411 --> 01:06:45.850
we have a few other people that we think will be a nice fit as a companion to

1024
01:06:45.851 --> 01:06:46.540
your mom's house.

1025
01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:50.440
So the whole idea is it's people that we know that this audience responds to

1026
01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:53.090
people.
It's not people who you know at,

1027
01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:55.420
you know everyone likes cause everyone doesn't like everyone,

1028
01:06:55.421 --> 01:06:58.330
but it's people who,
the majority of people were always like,
yeah,
we,
we,

1029
01:06:58.350 --> 01:07:00.970
we like this person.
Well,
I'm excited to have video.

1030
01:07:00.971 --> 01:07:04.690
Like I'm excited to have video.
Uh,
you know,
I want to take it,

1031
01:07:04.691 --> 01:07:07.780
I want to do a lot of stuff.
I have some ideas for patrion awesome.

1032
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:12.430
I want that shit down.
I'm excited to do some stuff with you guys.

1033
01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:16.540
It's going to be fun,
man.
Everybody knows the mommy's listening and watching.

1034
01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:19.230
We're not going to change our show,
so don't worry.

1035
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:23.470
Your mom's house is going to stay exactly the same except we're going to upgrade

1036
01:07:23.471 --> 01:07:26.500
the studio a little bit.
You'll see some cooler shit,
some slick stuff,

1037
01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:29.960
some neat stuff,
some real raw stuff too.
[inaudible]
right.

1038
01:07:30.270 --> 01:07:32.920
We got to go full trial.
We're gonna get physical with with music,

1039
01:07:32.921 --> 01:07:36.100
so that's going to be nice.
Yeah.
Physical podcasts and physical comedy.

1040
01:07:36.930 --> 01:07:40.570
You got to do it.
Get physical with podcast.
Fucking Provo.

1041
01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:45.780
You got to do that.
Let's find Phillips.
Give,
let's get physical doing podcasts.

1042
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:48.223
I like that

1043
01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:55.030
you're smiling.
Genuinely you need to do,
do look like him though.

1044
01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:59.170
Honest to God people when they Photoshop it,

1045
01:07:59.171 --> 01:08:02.560
I have to look three or four times like,
is this really like,
I'm like,

1046
01:08:02.561 --> 01:08:07.090
is that just like you kind of look like Doris BrooksBrooks' Bro,

1047
01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:12.070
don't let,
don't really smile.
Like make your eyes not matched your mouth.

1048
01:08:15.530 --> 01:08:16.010
That's how he

1049
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:20.750
<v 0>smiles Garth,
but bigger
that it matches.
Yeah.</v>

1050
01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:25.460
The one that I didn't post,
I didn't repose,
but this one I was like,
whew.

1051
01:08:25.461 --> 01:08:29.720
The Photoshop.
It looks like it was too easy.
That's what I'm saying,
man.

1052
01:08:29.721 --> 01:08:33.270
Just lay it right in there.
Yeah,
just put a hat on top.

1053
01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:37.910
I put in and out.
He's got blue eyes in the same coloring is you I think,
right?

1054
01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:42.500
He does those really pretty blue eyes.
They're probably Photoshop.
Tom's aren't.

1055
01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:47.640
No,
it's already buried.
Oh,
here it is.
I mean,
Shit.
I'm just like,

1056
01:08:52.050 --> 01:08:54.410
oh,
it's so ridiculous.

1057
01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:58.170
It says let's get physical Nicholas

1058
01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:05.050
talented Photoshop or you got some,
you got some bees out there.
All right.

1059
01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:08.530
The new album,
it's um,
what's it called?
Get Ahold of your

1060
01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:15.140
iTunes,
Amazon,
Google play,
Spotify,
Pandora.
Everywhere you get it.

1061
01:09:15.290 --> 01:09:18.230
Sicklers the best.
Support the album.
Please get it.

1062
01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:20.360
And I'm number one on iTunes right now.

1063
01:09:22.730 --> 01:09:27.020
Sorry for the quick,
abrupt segue.
I forgot to do it live,

1064
01:09:27.021 --> 01:09:28.190
so I'm doing it now.

1065
01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:33.230
We're going to jump over to our conversation with Sean Anders,
the writer,

1066
01:09:33.231 --> 01:09:37.940
director of instant family.
It's a great time.
I'm sorry.

1067
01:09:38.330 --> 01:09:43.190
Here's that.
So excited and thrilled that this worked out.

1068
01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:45.200
It is holiday week.

1069
01:09:45.201 --> 01:09:50.201
Obviously it's Thanksgiving week and I can actually say that yours truly is in a

1070
01:09:50.691 --> 01:09:54.770
movie that is playing in theaters right now.

1071
01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:58.370
You can take your family,
take them today,
tomorrow,

1072
01:09:58.371 --> 01:10:03.080
all weekend long to see instant family and we're being joined by the writer,

1073
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:06.680
director,
producer,
Mr Sean Anders.

1074
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:11.630
I just realized my chair is sinking now.
God,
why don't you do some weight?

1075
01:10:12.370 --> 01:10:16.640
Jesus.
We haven't had somebody waste so much that sits here before.
Oh,
Bert,
Bert.

1076
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:20.840
Well Bro,
bro,
bro,
Bro,
thanks for coming over.
First of all,

1077
01:10:20.841 --> 01:10:23.180
thanks for having me here.
Thanks for making actually,
you know,

1078
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:26.840
I know this feels hokey and sincere.
Uh,
but I,

1079
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:30.590
you actually made a dream of mine come true by putting me in a movie.
Wow.
So,

1080
01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:35.090
and I almost,
I don't want to get too emotional.
I'm going to remove eye contact.

1081
01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.910
Um,
no,
but you know,
when I moved out here,

1082
01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:42.140
the honest to God truth is I never had any aspirations whatsoever to do standup.

1083
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:45.230
I didn't come out of here with that idea of my whole thing was like,

1084
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:48.470
I just want to act and I wanted to act in movies,
not television.

1085
01:10:48.471 --> 01:10:52.510
I love movies and I thought I would be a comedic actor.
That's,

1086
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:55.250
that's really what I thought I would do.
I went to the Groundlings,

1087
01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:59.360
I did some shows with second city,
uh,
groups like,
you know,
sketch shows.

1088
01:10:59.361 --> 01:11:01.910
And I was like,
you know,
I booked a couple of commercials.
I was like,
oh,

1089
01:11:01.911 --> 01:11:05.730
this is like a natural progression.
I'll be an actor and I,
you know,

1090
01:11:05.890 --> 01:11:10.490
I fell into stand up and I started to work as a standup and then that went that

1091
01:11:10.491 --> 01:11:14.190
way.
But man de last fit sounds crazy,
15,
16

1092
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:18.030
<v 19>years.
I was always like,
man,
fucking sucks.
And then as specialists came out,</v>

1093
01:11:18.330 --> 01:11:18.780
I'd be like,

1094
01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:22.320
there's no one fucking director that could watch something that I'm in and be

1095
01:11:22.321 --> 01:11:23.440
like,
he could play apart.

1096
01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:28.290
It turns out that was and a so thank you so much for giving me the opportunity

1097
01:11:28.291 --> 01:11:33.240
man.
Well,
no man,
thank you.
You,
you killed it.
And uh,
and it's funny because my,

1098
01:11:33.241 --> 01:11:37.830
the way I got started,
I was kind of the opposite.
I loved movies,

1099
01:11:37.831 --> 01:11:41.460
but I never thought in a million years that I'd have a shot at doing this kind

1100
01:11:41.461 --> 01:11:41.821
of stuff.

1101
01:11:41.821 --> 01:11:46.320
So me and my friends just made a movie just purely just for fun and just to have

1102
01:11:46.321 --> 01:11:50.400
a good time and just to see if we could do it.
And it turned into this nonsense,

1103
01:11:50.401 --> 01:11:53.550
you know?
So you have a fucking crazy career now.
I,

1104
01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:56.610
what did you first make tell us that we made this movie.

1105
01:11:56.610 --> 01:12:01.610
It's called NBT never been thawed and it was a mockumentary because that's what

1106
01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:03.930
you do and you don't have any money and you want to make a comedy.

1107
01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:08.100
And it was about a group of people that collect frozen entrees and they're

1108
01:12:08.101 --> 01:12:11.070
trying to put on the first frozen entree enthusiasts convention.

1109
01:12:12.090 --> 01:12:14.310
And it was just kind of about subculture and nonsense.

1110
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:18.030
And we just did it purely for fun and it,
and it Kinda of juice.

1111
01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:23.380
I should not have said anything.
That's me.
Yeah.
I know.

1112
01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:28.400
It's so interesting about people who take in their lives is that there was a

1113
01:12:28.801 --> 01:12:33.210
time when you were just this kid in Wisconsin who was like,

1114
01:12:33.211 --> 01:12:36.630
I'd love to direct movies Sunday and we just made this thing and then this

1115
01:12:36.631 --> 01:12:39.480
happens and so done by the way.
So incredibly dumb.

1116
01:12:40.090 --> 01:12:43.350
Like just so just painfully dumb.
And uh,

1117
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:47.270
I don't know how that's how you describe yourself.
I say to lead though,

1118
01:12:47.290 --> 01:12:50.580
we were just talking about Isabella right before we started about Isabella

1119
01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:54.450
Manayer who plays at Lizzie and the movie and she's just crazy talented,

1120
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:57.030
this kid.
It's also,
it's funny you say that though.

1121
01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:59.900
We were talking about how talented she is and what a career she has going.

1122
01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:01.950
The other thing is like when you talked to her,

1123
01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:06.730
a couple of things that come through like in my experience was that like a um,

1124
01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:11.700
w superintelligent yeah.
Um,
and like it doesn't conduct,

1125
01:13:11.701 --> 01:13:13.770
like when I talked to her on the set,

1126
01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.710
I don't feel like I'm talking to like a teenager.
Right.
You know,

1127
01:13:16.711 --> 01:13:20.310
you kind of feel like you're talking to an adult and I'm sure that contributes

1128
01:13:20.311 --> 01:13:24.690
to confidence and success as a 16 year old.
And you know,

1129
01:13:24.691 --> 01:13:28.140
because a,
that's not the way most teenagers conduct himself.

1130
01:13:28.141 --> 01:13:29.820
But that's what I mean is that when I was that age,

1131
01:13:29.821 --> 01:13:32.040
I don't think I could barely even put a sentence together.

1132
01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:35.170
And actually she inspired me being around her.

1133
01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:37.590
I started bringing my kids to work more often,

1134
01:13:37.591 --> 01:13:40.050
bringing them to the edit bay and stuff.
Cause I thought I need to just,

1135
01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:44.400
I need you to make sure that my kids are around grownups enough to just get that

1136
01:13:44.401 --> 01:13:47.370
confidence to be able to just,
you know,
when the grownups come up and say,
Hey,

1137
01:13:47.371 --> 01:13:49.430
what's your name and not go through.
Yeah.

1138
01:13:51.370 --> 01:13:53.010
You always have this thing.

1139
01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:58.280
This is before we even had kids where you always noted when we walk into like an

1140
01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:02.280
elevator or something,
you're like the,

1141
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:06.510
like you'd say hello to a kid and you're like,
I'm still just say hello.
Yeah,

1142
01:14:07.170 --> 01:14:10.050
hello to somebody.
Which I was always like,
oh,
okay.

1143
01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:12.310
Because he's sumption is when you're a child,
that adults,

1144
01:14:12.311 --> 01:14:16.570
because they're older than you know everything or they know better than you and

1145
01:14:16.571 --> 01:14:19.410
then you become an adult in your life.
These dumb motherfuckers,

1146
01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:20.860
these people are dumber than me.

1147
01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:26.190
Why are you talking about so that and also having the audacity to dream big and

1148
01:14:26.381 --> 01:14:30.100
to do the thing you want to do.
It's so important.
You know?

1149
01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:34.490
I could never do that.
Like you,
of course you can.
Yeah.
About,

1150
01:14:34.730 --> 01:14:36.760
about going just doing it.

1151
01:14:38.130 --> 01:14:43.130
But I do talk about how dreaming big is like so important and,

1152
01:14:44.230 --> 01:14:46.480
and not letting people,
you know,

1153
01:14:46.481 --> 01:14:49.180
cause a lot of the time do you say like something like I want to make a movie

1154
01:14:49.181 --> 01:14:53.170
and they're like,
yeah,
you fucking,
you know,
people are like,
come on man.

1155
01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:57.970
People really say that a lot more people say that.
Then the other way,
you know,

1156
01:14:58.450 --> 01:15:03.310
well you were saying that your father was a mailman and your family is pretty,

1157
01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:06.640
you know,
they're working.
My Dad was a forklift mechanic and I think to,

1158
01:15:06.641 --> 01:15:08.530
the thought of being in show business was like,

1159
01:15:08.531 --> 01:15:11.210
I may as well have told him I wanted to go to the moon and live there.

1160
01:15:11.290 --> 01:15:12.700
It was like,
why would you even,

1161
01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:16.960
were they supportive of you or they were supportive but the kind of like what

1162
01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:21.940
Tom said,
my dad grew up very poor,
so it was all about you gotta Punch in,

1163
01:15:21.941 --> 01:15:23.980
you got to get a steady paycheck,
all that kind of stuff.

1164
01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:28.600
I always wanted to do kind of what I wanted to do and,

1165
01:15:28.601 --> 01:15:32.020
but my parents were always really supportive of whatever cause they never had

1166
01:15:32.021 --> 01:15:34.660
that thought of like,
I think they knew from an early age,
he's not,

1167
01:15:34.690 --> 01:15:38.950
this guy's not running for Senate,
you know,
so they're,
you know,
whatever,

1168
01:15:38.951 --> 01:15:41.740
whatever makes you happy.
But you know,
I have to say though your,

1169
01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:44.290
your attitude about all of that,

1170
01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:48.400
it's really special being onset and having people around.

1171
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:51.130
And we had a lot of them on this movie who even people like,

1172
01:15:51.170 --> 01:15:53.200
like Julia Haggardy as an example,

1173
01:15:53.201 --> 01:15:57.100
who's spending like a thousand movies and has been doing it forever and still

1174
01:15:57.101 --> 01:16:00.850
has this glee about the process and about being there.

1175
01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:04.900
And whenever you have people around that are just like excited to be there,

1176
01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:08.700
it makes it so much.
That was really something cool about it.

1177
01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:11.710
Tom would come home and be like,
I love everybody.
I love everybody on this movie.

1178
01:16:11.711 --> 01:16:15.130
Everybody's nice,
everybody's turning into an actor.
I'm like,
Oh,

1179
01:16:15.131 --> 01:16:16.690
you got to meet all the other actors.

1180
01:16:19.150 --> 01:16:23.230
Such great people.
It's infectious.
But it also wasn't a,
you know,

1181
01:16:23.231 --> 01:16:25.030
for lack of a better word,
it wasn't like an actor.

1182
01:16:25.031 --> 01:16:28.420
He kind of vibe around there at all.
Like everybody was just really,
really cool.

1183
01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:28.961
Michael O'keefe,

1184
01:16:28.961 --> 01:16:33.961
100% thought I was a studio executive or if he came up cause I was wearing the

1185
01:16:34.751 --> 01:16:39.751
leather Russ leather jackets everybody all day we talk about like is that your

1186
01:16:40.061 --> 01:16:43.200
jacket?
And I was like,
it's just fucking jackets were inspired by my brother Ben.

1187
01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:49.160
Well he's got a little,
he's got a little Bob mixed in there a little bit,

1188
01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:53.050
but these people would come up and they're like shy.
But Mike goes,

1189
01:16:53.051 --> 01:16:54.460
thanks so much.
And I was like,

1190
01:16:54.461 --> 01:16:57.180
for what this is like right when I meet him and he's like,

1191
01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:00.730
it was just excited to be here and I turned to John Your writing partner and I

1192
01:17:00.731 --> 01:17:04.830
was like,
he just thanked me for this job and I was like,
no problem man.

1193
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.200
It's look like a day from the figure out that I'm in it.
Yeah.
Well,
I look,

1194
01:17:09.230 --> 01:17:10.070
I look like

1195
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:13.400
<v 4>a douchey producer on our park day cause I had my,</v>

1196
01:17:13.690 --> 01:17:17.420
my leather thing with the stripes and sung.
It's like a Hollywood dick.

1197
01:17:17.421 --> 01:17:19.520
Can I tell you the best part about seeing,

1198
01:17:19.521 --> 01:17:22.050
we saw the screening of instant family.
I think we,

1199
01:17:22.110 --> 01:17:26.810
I just given birth to Julian like a week before and we went to go see it and it

1200
01:17:26.811 --> 01:17:29.810
was so stunning to see my husband.
Oh,

1201
01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:32.020
I'm like the big screen and your beard was darker.

1202
01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:36.350
They took the gray out and your outfits were so funny.
I'm like,
Oh my God,

1203
01:17:36.351 --> 01:17:40.520
this guy's such a d bag.
Put you in this Douche bag.

1204
01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:42.920
It was so funny.
It was so good

1205
01:17:43.630 --> 01:17:48.550
<v 19>fun.
Uh,
dressing in things you wouldn't normally dress like,
you know what I mean?</v>

1206
01:17:48.551 --> 01:17:49.384
And embracing them.

1207
01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:52.180
That actually is probably one of the most perfect for the care.

1208
01:17:52.210 --> 01:17:54.220
That's one of the things about acting though is like,
you know,

1209
01:17:54.221 --> 01:17:55.540
doing things like changing your hair,

1210
01:17:55.541 --> 01:17:59.470
changing your clothes and then do you remember what we did to you with that

1211
01:17:59.471 --> 01:18:02.160
double tap?
Double.
Remember there,

1212
01:18:02.161 --> 01:18:04.660
there was the day that the double showed up because you weren't going to be able

1213
01:18:04.661 --> 01:18:07.240
to be,
there was a,
there was a shot.

1214
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:10.540
It didn't end up in the movie because honestly the devil was too far off.

1215
01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:12.860
You remember?
You don't remember this.
So this guy,

1216
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:16.510
this guy shows up who's going to be the Segora from behind double cause we were

1217
01:18:16.511 --> 01:18:18.600
just going to get a shot.
Now we're going to get a shot of,

1218
01:18:18.650 --> 01:18:22.060
of Tom and Allen walking toward the house on a day when Tom wasn't gonna be able

1219
01:18:22.061 --> 01:18:23.140
to be at that sat.

1220
01:18:23.650 --> 01:18:26.530
And the guy came up to just kind of like get his wardrobe approved and you were

1221
01:18:26.531 --> 01:18:27.670
going like,
what?

1222
01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:28.533
<v 4>I don't look like</v>

1223
01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:33.790
<v 19>when that would have been.
He,</v>

1224
01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:37.220
he looks pretty different than here and we ended up not using it like a super

1225
01:18:37.221 --> 01:18:38.054
hot.
Was He really?

1226
01:18:38.110 --> 01:18:39.620
<v 4>Yeah,
it was just red.</v>

1227
01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:46.460
<v 19>Oh Man.
Um,
so for people,
I mean obviously I've,</v>

1228
01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:47.811
I talked about,

1229
01:18:47.811 --> 01:18:52.811
we used to do episodes when I was in Atlanta and between life weeks,

1230
01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:55.160
you know,
while we were going back and forth.

1231
01:18:55.161 --> 01:18:58.250
And then I've been talking about it coming up and then you and I went on Rogan

1232
01:18:58.251 --> 01:19:02.630
together last week.
But for the people that don't know,
instant family,

1233
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:07.540
uh,
that you wrote and directed a,
I should say cowrote right?
Yeah.
With John,

1234
01:19:07.541 --> 01:19:11.510
John Worth,
Jon also produces and jobs there.
I'll every step of the way.

1235
01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:15.740
John's the best.
I haven't seen him since,
since this whole thing,
but,
uh,
I,
I,

1236
01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:19.220
I mean I didn't run into him in anything,
but John is fantastic,

1237
01:19:19.221 --> 01:19:23.690
but this story is in,
is inspired by your life and uh,

1238
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:28.750
it's about foster care and then you and your wife actually fostered,

1239
01:19:29.361 --> 01:19:33.510
adopted three siblings.
Yeah.
And,
and this,
so I think it's,

1240
01:19:33.710 --> 01:19:36.100
I was always thought it was important to note that,

1241
01:19:36.101 --> 01:19:40.550
that it's not just a guy going like,
we should write a movie about adopting.
Yeah.

1242
01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:43.430
And like try to hook people on that.
It's like,

1243
01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:47.690
it's influenced by something you really did.
Yeah.
It's amazing.
Yeah.
No,
it was,

1244
01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:48.291
you know,

1245
01:19:48.291 --> 01:19:53.150
after going through that process and being about three years into it,

1246
01:19:53.151 --> 01:19:55.310
it was actually John who said,
you know,

1247
01:19:55.311 --> 01:19:58.540
we should do a movie about this because you know,

1248
01:19:58.550 --> 01:20:01.700
none of us knew and I didn't know anything about it when I got involved in it.

1249
01:20:01.701 --> 01:20:04.700
And I was surprised there aren't that many things nowadays.
You know,

1250
01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:08.040
where you get into in the,
into a process and you're like,
oh,
I didn't

1251
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.920
<v 14>realize that you have to take these classes.
And I didn't realize that you've,</v>

1252
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:13.450
you know,
there's so many things about it that I didn't know.
Yeah.

1253
01:20:13.650 --> 01:20:15.810
And John didn't know.
So we thought,
well,
you know,

1254
01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:17.670
it would be good to shed some light on that stuff.

1255
01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:21.810
And also we thought we had sort of a unique perspective on it,

1256
01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:26.520
given that it is happening in my life and that so many movies that are made on

1257
01:20:26.521 --> 01:20:30.810
the topic really just focus on the sort of tragic elements of it.

1258
01:20:30.811 --> 01:20:34.020
But there's all these other elements of it too that are really wonderful and

1259
01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.030
full of love and laughter and all of that.

1260
01:20:36.031 --> 01:20:39.030
So we want it to be able to kind of cover all of it.

1261
01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:43.770
<v 3>Oh my God,
it's awesome.
And I tell you,
I'm pretty much,
I'm a comic.</v>

1262
01:20:43.771 --> 01:20:47.160
I'm cynical.
I made of Teflon for the most part.

1263
01:20:47.161 --> 01:20:49.800
I've cried on the show wants last,
last week.

1264
01:20:49.801 --> 01:20:53.760
When are we talking about the fire fire?
And I was crying,
but uh,
I'm telling you,

1265
01:20:53.761 --> 01:20:58.761
I am crying in a movie theater like that and so long and then the laughs and the

1266
01:20:59.161 --> 01:21:02.610
tiers,
it's really so unique in a movie.
You never,

1267
01:21:02.970 --> 01:21:06.610
you don't get to go on that much of a ride and it's such a well done film and

1268
01:21:06.810 --> 01:21:09.450
everyone goes,
see if for Thanksgiving this is a perfect week to,

1269
01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:12.780
it's a perfect way to go see it.
And it's,
wait,
how old are the kids now?

1270
01:21:13.170 --> 01:21:16.620
<v 14>Well,
my kids are different ages than the kids in the movie.
Um,</v>

1271
01:21:16.621 --> 01:21:19.170
so my kids are now 13.
Uh,

1272
01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:21.720
I hate it when there's that little pause and you're like,
oh,

1273
01:21:21.721 --> 01:21:24.810
I looked like the worst parent in the world.
Pause.
I'm like,
is it 13,

1274
01:21:24.811 --> 01:21:29.530
nine and eight?
I know my kid's age.
All right.
Um,
but no,

1275
01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:32.980
and it's one of the stories I like to tell about the movie that,
um,

1276
01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:35.760
when my wife and I got into it,
when you go see the movie,

1277
01:21:35.761 --> 01:21:39.510
you'll see that the characters go to this bizarre thing called an adoption fair,

1278
01:21:39.511 --> 01:21:43.650
which is a really controversial,
strange thing.
And we went to one because,

1279
01:21:43.651 --> 01:21:44.280
you know,
they,

1280
01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:47.580
the social workers invited us and we went there and it was one of the weirdest

1281
01:21:47.581 --> 01:21:48.540
things we've ever been to.

1282
01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:52.830
And we did meet a teenage girl there and her younger siblings,

1283
01:21:53.070 --> 01:21:56.730
like the characters in the movie.
And we did not,

1284
01:21:57.210 --> 01:22:01.910
we did not feel ready to sign up to have a teenager in our house.
But of course,

1285
01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:05.670
girl seem great.
She seemed really cool and we just thought,
all right,

1286
01:22:05.671 --> 01:22:09.360
so we wrote her,
we wrote them down on our sheet with just a lot of trepidation.

1287
01:22:09.390 --> 01:22:13.910
And then,
uh,
and then before anything happened,
uh,

1288
01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:15.960
they,
the social worker called and said,

1289
01:22:16.530 --> 01:22:21.530
these kids have been in care for four years and this teenage girl is really

1290
01:22:21.541 --> 01:22:24.870
holding out hope that her mom's coming back.
So she's refusing the placement.

1291
01:22:25.170 --> 01:22:27.810
So anyway,
that's why we have a teenager in the movie.

1292
01:22:27.811 --> 01:22:31.590
Cause I never forgot that girl.
And then when the time came to make the movie,

1293
01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:35.430
I really wanted to put a teenager in because those are the kids that really,

1294
01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:39.000
you know,
are misunderstood and yeah.
And uh,
but yeah,
my kids,

1295
01:22:39.001 --> 01:22:41.790
so what happened in my case was shortly after that,

1296
01:22:41.791 --> 01:22:44.610
our social worker called and said,
oh,
but there's these other three kids.

1297
01:22:44.611 --> 01:22:46.860
And that's how random it was.
It was just like,
okay,

1298
01:22:46.861 --> 01:22:48.930
there's these other three kids and they were six,

1299
01:22:48.931 --> 01:22:50.370
three and 18 months at the time.

1300
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:54.550
<v 3>Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
How did you do it?</v>

1301
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:59.230
I don't know.
It was,
it was horrible.
Well,
and especially going at first,

1302
01:22:59.231 --> 01:23:01.670
at first it was horrible because the normal,
I'm a normal,

1303
01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:06.130
whatever traditional route is,
you have a newborn and you're thrown that chaos

1304
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:08.650
<v 14>and that it's like your bootcamp for being a parent.</v>

1305
01:23:09.190 --> 01:23:13.420
But you got like all three children at once.
Different stages.

1306
01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:18.370
We Really Thought,
oh my God,
no,
we can,
we can,
you know,
I mean,
we knew,

1307
01:23:18.371 --> 01:23:22.000
you kind of know intellectually there's a storm coming,
but like you don't,

1308
01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:24.420
you just don't realize.
Did you,
at the time

1309
01:23:24.730 --> 01:23:26.830
<v 0>when you first got your children,</v>

1310
01:23:27.190 --> 01:23:29.680
was it schools time where you like able to have it?
Yeah.

1311
01:23:29.710 --> 01:23:33.220
<v 14>At least.
Yeah.
No,
that's a great question.
Nobody ever asks that question.</v>

1312
01:23:33.221 --> 01:23:37.780
And that's the thing is that,
and they're strict about that stuff.
So it's like,

1313
01:23:37.870 --> 01:23:42.410
welcome to our home day one.
Okay.
And then our two younger were,
you know,

1314
01:23:42.450 --> 01:23:44.620
they didn't have to go to school,
but our oldest,

1315
01:23:44.621 --> 01:23:48.730
our son had to be like right into a new school like that day.

1316
01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:52.230
So you don't even get a minute.
You know,
I was like,

1317
01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:53.380
we had to go and sign them up.

1318
01:23:53.381 --> 01:23:56.080
And then it turned out the school that was closest to our house didn't,

1319
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:59.770
was overfull so,
but the other one was like,
you know,

1320
01:24:00.190 --> 01:24:04.510
0.2 of a mile further or whatever.
And uh,
but no,
it's,
it was,
so,

1321
01:24:04.511 --> 01:24:08.110
it was just everything.
Immediately it was just school and teachers and kids.

1322
01:24:08.111 --> 01:24:11.140
And it was saying that tense.
Yeah,
it was intense.

1323
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:14.950
Do you have the kids or the oldest or all of them seen the film?
Oh yeah.

1324
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:19.930
And Oh they love it.
They've,
I mean they,
they don't see it because it's not,

1325
01:24:19.931 --> 01:24:22.390
it's not a bio pic about her family.

1326
01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:25.630
They recognize specific moments that they remember,

1327
01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:27.790
but they've been around for the whole thing,

1328
01:24:27.791 --> 01:24:30.040
including when I was talking about it when it was a script,

1329
01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:33.400
cause we'd be having dinner and I beat my wife and I or my kids would be trying

1330
01:24:33.401 --> 01:24:37.840
to remember certain things and then they would come to set and they were in the

1331
01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:40.260
Edit Bay and they've been around.
What a cool experience for them.

1332
01:24:40.330 --> 01:24:43.510
It's been a really cool for your wife.
Yeah,
I mean,
my wife,

1333
01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:47.470
one of the things I love about my wife is that she has absolutely zero craving

1334
01:24:47.471 --> 01:24:51.190
for the spotlight at all or anything.
Like,
you know,
my wife,

1335
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:56.500
like if I did a podcast,
my wife would never be a part of it.

1336
01:24:56.501 --> 01:24:58.380
She would not have nothing.
No,
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1337
01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:05.350
And if I did a podcast,
my husband,
so I mean,
I don't know,
it's your podcast.

1338
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:08.590
So anyway,
uh,
no,
she just,

1339
01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:12.880
so this has been interesting because she has been,
you know,

1340
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.450
in these interviews and in certain things and she's been great about it,

1341
01:25:16.451 --> 01:25:19.600
but she's kind of like reading,
reading,
reading.
Come you guys,

1342
01:25:19.601 --> 01:25:20.550
you must have some fun.

1343
01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:23.680
<v 0>The one thing I was thinking about earlier today when you're on your way over</v>

1344
01:25:23.681 --> 01:25:28.270
here,
it's like your children are Latin.
Um,
my mother is,
yeah.

1345
01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:32.740
And My mother looks distinctly Latin.
Right.
And like you,

1346
01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:35.320
yeah.
Like,
like me,
like my young,
my youngest,

1347
01:25:35.321 --> 01:25:39.880
it's weird the way genetics work because my younger sister looks like a carbon

1348
01:25:39.881 --> 01:25:44.080
copy of my mom.
Right.
And then I definitely,
my dad,
who's like a white boy,

1349
01:25:44.081 --> 01:25:48.370
white boy,
I just inherited,
you know,
the fair skin and everything.

1350
01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:50.440
And throughout my life,

1351
01:25:50.441 --> 01:25:54.730
I can tell you countless times where I'd be with my mom and talking to someone

1352
01:25:54.731 --> 01:25:58.750
and then they'd be like,
who's that lady?
That's my mom.

1353
01:25:59.170 --> 01:26:03.740
And they're like,
did she adopt you?
And I'd be like,
no,
that's actually my mother.

1354
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:08.330
<v 14>Uh,
do you run into,
um,
you know,
I guess you'll probably get it at some point.</v>

1355
01:26:08.331 --> 01:26:12.800
It gets like countless looks or whatever,
but do people go,
like are those,
no,

1356
01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:17.120
I mean,
I mean so often,
you know,

1357
01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:21.470
either I'm just with the kids and I think people just assume that upon my wife

1358
01:26:21.471 --> 01:26:25.280
is,
is Latin or whatever.
You know,
and you know,

1359
01:26:25.281 --> 01:26:29.000
it's funny when we were going through the classes,
the,
the foster classes,

1360
01:26:29.001 --> 01:26:31.520
cause you have to take these like eight weeks of classes before you,

1361
01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:34.220
before you're certified.
And they talked about that a lot.

1362
01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:37.130
And people that get really jumpy about that,
about like,
well what are,

1363
01:26:37.131 --> 01:26:40.190
what are people going to say and how are people that,
you know,
and we,

1364
01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:45.250
we had that moment of how are people going to perceive this as far as us being

1365
01:26:46.221 --> 01:26:48.170
the white family and all of that kind of stuff.

1366
01:26:48.230 --> 01:26:50.930
But we didn't have any worry at all about like,
oh no,

1367
01:26:50.931 --> 01:26:52.730
people are going to know our kids are adopted.

1368
01:26:52.731 --> 01:26:56.240
I don't care if they know our kids are at that.
I mean,
and that's,

1369
01:26:56.241 --> 01:26:57.770
I think part of it is that people are,

1370
01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:01.430
I think nowadays people have a much better understanding that your,

1371
01:27:01.431 --> 01:27:05.000
you love your kids just as much,
if that's true,
this is a different era.

1372
01:27:05.170 --> 01:27:09.140
Or if there was a time I think for a long time that people would almost approach

1373
01:27:09.141 --> 01:27:12.350
it with pity.
Like,
oh you couldn't,
you have your own kids or whatever.

1374
01:27:12.410 --> 01:27:15.860
Whatever crazy things people would come up with.
But we don't know.
I don't,

1375
01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:20.900
I don't really know.
My older,
my older sister has,
um,

1376
01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:26.200
black hair and dark eyes and she married like basically a Nordic guy.

1377
01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:30.650
Yeah.
And so both of her children are blonde,
blonde,

1378
01:27:30.651 --> 01:27:34.250
blonde with blue eyes and everywhere.
She's like,

1379
01:27:34.251 --> 01:27:38.720
everywhere I go they ask me like if the mother knows that because they all

1380
01:27:38.721 --> 01:27:43.721
assume she's the nanny and it makes me so happy because they're like,

1381
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.560
where does she live?
She lives in Florida.
And she was just like,
she was like,

1382
01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:48.740
she'll bring them in.
And they were like,

1383
01:27:48.741 --> 01:27:52.820
and then as I was their mother aware that and she's like,
I am their mother.

1384
01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:54.830
And they were like,
okay,
that's true.

1385
01:27:57.740 --> 01:28:02.510
Oh man,
she deserves it.
So this is the [inaudible].
Okay.

1386
01:28:02.511 --> 01:28:04.280
Are you ready to work before we do that?

1387
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:06.830
The other thing that I just wanted to give you credit for it because you're the

1388
01:28:06.831 --> 01:28:11.600
only person that said this.
Um,
when you guys came to see the movie afterwards,

1389
01:28:11.601 --> 01:28:12.770
when we were talking afterwards,

1390
01:28:12.771 --> 01:28:16.220
you said that you loved that Pete Nelly who are played by Mark Wahlberg and

1391
01:28:16.270 --> 01:28:19.340
Roseburg seemed like a couple that actually loves each other.

1392
01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:22.900
And I was so happy that you said that because,

1393
01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:24.770
because as we were making the movie,
there were,

1394
01:28:25.010 --> 01:28:27.080
there were different people along the route that we're like,

1395
01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:29.540
they should be fighting more,
they should be attacking each other more.

1396
01:28:29.541 --> 01:28:33.590
And I was like,
you know,
that's not really how it was for us,
for my wife and I,

1397
01:28:33.591 --> 01:28:34.790
we,
you,
you kind of,

1398
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:38.360
you have to kind of stick together a little bit in that situation.

1399
01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:44.240
Exactly.
But you're the only person who actually said that.

1400
01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:48.980
And I was made me so happy.
I called death and I was like,
you know what?
She said,

1401
01:28:49.970 --> 01:28:53.420
I'll,
I'll say this too.
I mean like we watch a lot of shows together.

1402
01:28:53.690 --> 01:28:57.950
One of the things that just over time that we've realized is that totally

1403
01:28:57.951 --> 01:29:02.550
removed from this film or story.
It's such a bummer to watch,

1404
01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:07.640
uh,
couples that don't like each other.
You know,
like in movies and entertainment.

1405
01:29:07.710 --> 01:29:10.920
Like you see all these shows,
like the show will be like,

1406
01:29:10.921 --> 01:29:15.390
here's the reality of marriage.
And then it's like,
um,
you know,

1407
01:29:15.391 --> 01:29:18.330
just bickering or the resentment and you're like,
okay.

1408
01:29:18.510 --> 01:29:20.940
I mean maybe that's some somewhat of reality,
but like,

1409
01:29:21.210 --> 01:29:24.420
I don't want to watch this.
I don't want to watch.

1410
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:29.640
I got a piece of advice from a really good friend a long time ago and she said

1411
01:29:29.670 --> 01:29:32.730
that her mom gave her this advice that her mom told her,

1412
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:36.570
you people are going to tell you your whole life that relationships are hard.

1413
01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:40.590
And she said it's not true.
Bad relationships are hard.

1414
01:29:41.130 --> 01:29:45.030
Relationships are relatively easy.
And I think,
I mean as,

1415
01:29:45.031 --> 01:29:50.031
as as dark and just crazy funny and bizarre of places that you guys go into on

1416
01:29:50.311 --> 01:29:52.980
this podcast.
As much as you guys might not want to admit it.

1417
01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:57.300
A huge secret to the charm of your podcast is how much you guys obviously enjoy

1418
01:30:00.110 --> 01:30:03.100
the show.
And it went well.

1419
01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:07.080
But yeah,

1420
01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:12.080
I liked watching the couple in your movie because they also had normal reactions

1421
01:30:12.721 --> 01:30:17.460
to extraordinary circumstances.
I don't know if you guys kept it in the movie,

1422
01:30:17.461 --> 01:30:22.390
the final cut,
but where's that one where Mark Wahlberg is kinda being like,

1423
01:30:22.410 --> 01:30:24.600
should we give them back?
Should we give them back

1424
01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:31.440
all the time?
Like do we make a big mistake?
It's really funny cause yeah,

1425
01:30:31.441 --> 01:30:33.510
the scene that you're referring to there,

1426
01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:36.900
they're just sort of at their wits and they're at a very low point.
They're lost,

1427
01:30:36.901 --> 01:30:38.940
they're scared.
And they're talking about,

1428
01:30:38.941 --> 01:30:43.080
there's gotta be some way back to the easy quiet life had before.

1429
01:30:43.290 --> 01:30:46.290
And my wife and I very much had that conversation.
I'm not proud of it.

1430
01:30:46.291 --> 01:30:49.950
But what I've found and I've been screening the movie for groups all across the

1431
01:30:49.951 --> 01:30:53.790
country,
it's really funny when you show it to regular general audiences,

1432
01:30:53.791 --> 01:30:56.040
they sort of gasp at that scene and then,

1433
01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:58.800
but then when you show it to adoptive families,

1434
01:30:58.801 --> 01:31:00.900
they roar at that scene because they're all like,
oh yeah,

1435
01:31:00.901 --> 01:31:04.440
we totally had a conversation like seven times.
Cause it's just,

1436
01:31:04.441 --> 01:31:07.920
it's a hard adjustment to make.
And then once you do make the adjustment,

1437
01:31:07.921 --> 01:31:09.510
it's the best thing that ever happened to you.

1438
01:31:09.511 --> 01:31:12.720
But you still have to get through that hard time first.
Of course

1439
01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:18.780
we just had our second baby.
So then you start to go like,
oh my God,

1440
01:31:18.781 --> 01:31:21.870
what did we do?
Like one was manageable.
One,

1441
01:31:21.871 --> 01:31:25.960
we could still leave the country too is like fucking chaos man.

1442
01:31:25.961 --> 01:31:28.890
Well I'm going to crush you right now.
Three is a great,
it's a great number.

1443
01:31:28.891 --> 01:31:33.180
I'm not alone.
It's shut down and shut it down.

1444
01:31:33.210 --> 01:31:36.600
I've said to her a bunch and she's yelled at me.
I was like,
come on.

1445
01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:39.210
Cause when they get a little bigger three,
well it,

1446
01:31:39.211 --> 01:31:41.070
that's why when they get a little bigger,

1447
01:31:41.071 --> 01:31:44.160
three is such a great number because they can kind of pair it if one of them

1448
01:31:44.161 --> 01:31:47.230
wants to be alone.
The other ones,
so somebody to play with and they kind of like,

1449
01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:51.910
it really is a,
it's a,
it's a more manageable number than you think.
I don't know.

1450
01:31:54.530 --> 01:31:55.860
No,
I didn't tell you this.

1451
01:31:55.861 --> 01:32:00.010
I mentioned this I think last week when we did that podcast.
But um,
the funny

1452
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:03.040
<v 19>thing is that ever since being in this movie and talking about it,</v>

1453
01:32:03.490 --> 01:32:08.410
men emails left and right and messages left and right about people who either

1454
01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:11.910
have adopted are going to adopt or know someone that is adopting.
Yeah.

1455
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:14.860
So you ended up learning what I mean.
And even one of my friends,
uh,

1456
01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:19.880
Greg told me that his sister and her husband are adopting four siblings this

1457
01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:24.770
week.
Oh Wow.
Yeah.
What are their names?
Um,
I don't know.
Oh,
who is it now?

1458
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:29.080
Call me.
He's a comic in Minnesota and he was,
when you hear that,
what's,

1459
01:32:29.081 --> 01:32:31.120
here's what's so incredibly cool about that.

1460
01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:36.760
For siblings run such a high risk of being split up.
Here we go.
Greg Coleman,

1461
01:32:36.850 --> 01:32:39.070
my sister husband are adopting four kids next week.

1462
01:32:39.130 --> 01:32:42.790
One tire fam is going to see instant family next week as a warmup.

1463
01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:47.880
Good for them.
That's really cool.
Yeah.
I want to talk to

1464
01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:54.160
just add four.
Well now you know that when my wife and I,

1465
01:32:54.161 --> 01:32:56.200
when we went to that adoption fair,

1466
01:32:56.470 --> 01:33:01.470
we also met five girls that were between two and like 12.

1467
01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:06.400
And I just was watching these kids going like,
oh my God,
nobody.

1468
01:33:06.401 --> 01:33:10.770
Five kids.
And my wife was like,
there's no way.
Five.
Yeah.
And,

1469
01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:12.940
but we ended up,
this is how crazy we are that,

1470
01:33:12.941 --> 01:33:16.690
that when the thing with the teenager,
it didn't work out.
We did sort of,

1471
01:33:16.750 --> 01:33:18.940
cause we just kept thinking about these girls weren't like,

1472
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:21.190
they're definitely gonna get split up.
They're going to get split up.

1473
01:33:21.191 --> 01:33:25.120
So we called the social worker and we were like,
what about these?

1474
01:33:25.121 --> 01:33:28.120
And she was like,
oh no.
They placed them all together,
a room and we were like,

1475
01:33:28.570 --> 01:33:33.220
oh good.
Oh good.
Yeah.
So,
um,
that's really made it,

1476
01:33:33.221 --> 01:33:36.130
it was like swinging five bats on the on deck circle,
you know,
in the end.

1477
01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:39.670
Cause it was like,
you know,
then after talking about five,

1478
01:33:39.671 --> 01:33:40.570
we're talking about a teenager.

1479
01:33:40.571 --> 01:33:43.960
All of a sudden three younger kids seemed a little more manageable.
It wasn't,

1480
01:33:43.961 --> 01:33:46.520
but it seemed,
it wasn't though really interesting.

1481
01:33:46.521 --> 01:33:49.750
And I like about your film too,
I think because I had just had our second child.

1482
01:33:49.751 --> 01:33:52.780
It's like you don't realize how complicating parenting,

1483
01:33:52.810 --> 01:33:57.010
how complicated parenting is until you really do it and you're like,
oh man,

1484
01:33:57.011 --> 01:33:58.270
there's so many emotions.

1485
01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:03.600
Like I go from like joy to anger to exhilaration to exhaustion all day.

1486
01:34:05.050 --> 01:34:09.520
You don't realize how crazy you are until the kids come in and sort of draw that

1487
01:34:09.521 --> 01:34:11.950
out and then you're like,
oh,
I'm a psychopath.

1488
01:34:12.190 --> 01:34:14.440
I had no idea that I was just insane.

1489
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.460
I had this a full,

1490
01:34:17.470 --> 01:34:22.470
the two hours while you were gone with our big boy was I was like kind of a walk

1491
01:34:22.541 --> 01:34:26.820
with him that I'm on a notes call.
Yeah.

1492
01:34:26.830 --> 01:34:31.750
Doing a note on a walk with him and he's like trashcan.
And I'm like,
I go,
yeah,

1493
01:34:31.751 --> 01:34:36.400
that other scene we could probably
just like,

1494
01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:38.290
it just reminds me of bikes.
Like

1495
01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:43.010
you just have to surrender,
you know?
Right.

1496
01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:46.010
Like isn't there a point where you're just like fuck it,
it's just chaos.

1497
01:34:46.011 --> 01:34:50.490
And then he wrote on there on the couch,
got back and I was telling Shana,

1498
01:34:50.491 --> 01:34:53.660
I started to talk to him like he was going to give me a explanation.
I go,

1499
01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:57.070
why would you do that?
I told you not to do that.
He goes to five.

1500
01:34:59.050 --> 01:35:02.210
<v 4>Yeah.
Dammit.
I know.</v>

1501
01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:07.700
<v 14>Anyways,
well we had this thing where where we always have these meetings,</v>

1502
01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:09.770
like what?
We'll have dinner,
we'll be like,
okay,

1503
01:35:09.771 --> 01:35:11.180
it's going to be like family meeting night.

1504
01:35:11.181 --> 01:35:13.580
We're going to talk about whatever we need to talk about.

1505
01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:17.450
And my kid said to me at one point you shout too much.
And I was like,

1506
01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:19.340
I know I shout,
I hate shouting,

1507
01:35:19.341 --> 01:35:22.640
but you guys won't listen to any two,

1508
01:35:22.641 --> 01:35:25.940
one syllable that I say until I start shouting at you.

1509
01:35:25.941 --> 01:35:29.720
And then all of a sudden you're like all ears.
But up until then,
so then I said,

1510
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:30.261
how about this?

1511
01:35:30.261 --> 01:35:34.460
How about I say I'm about to shout and when you hear I'm about to shout,

1512
01:35:34.461 --> 01:35:37.310
just take that as I'm already shouting and then,

1513
01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:41.420
and then listen to me and look at me.
And they were like,
okay,
all right,

1514
01:35:41.421 --> 01:35:44.510
we can do that.
And then it'd be like,
okay you guys,
you guys,
I'm about to shout.

1515
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:47.920
I am about to shout.
And they'd be like,
whatever.
I'm gonna be like,

1516
01:35:50.090 --> 01:35:54.340
<v 4>yeah,
keep shining.
Dammit.
I'm a chef.
I want to shout.
Oh,</v>

1517
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:58.910
you're going to shout a lot of two boys.
Yeah.
God dammit Shit.

1518
01:35:59.140 --> 01:36:01.530
Do you know who I wonder shouts.
Okay,
here we go.

1519
01:36:01.531 --> 01:36:05.790
Inside Studio g where music is first here.
And uh,
I like it that way.

1520
01:36:05.970 --> 01:36:06.803
Really cool.

1521
01:36:10.110 --> 01:36:14.190
I got uh,
uh,
is that supposed to happen right there?

1522
01:36:14.670 --> 01:36:18.140
Right there.
Brain.
You're a director.
Yeah.

1523
01:36:18.230 --> 01:36:21.510
That's a great emotional turnoff right there.
Yep.
Right.

1524
01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:26.820
I got it.
Cause this is like,
I'm thinking about this,

1525
01:36:26.821 --> 01:36:27.900
this supposed to happen.

1526
01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:32.070
I am thinking about reaching under someone's chest plate and then removing the

1527
01:36:32.071 --> 01:36:36.070
heart with my bare fucking hand.
See they see

1528
01:36:38.770 --> 01:36:40.360
me happy

1529
01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:47.960
birthday to G.

1530
01:36:48.810 --> 01:36:53.610
Okay Buddy.
Um,
bow,
I don't fucking,
do you ever get,

1531
01:36:53.611 --> 01:36:57.940
you knew about,
you knew about uh,
Chris Gaines,
right?
Yeah.
And He,
yeah,

1532
01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:02.900
that was his character alter ego,
right.
Oddly Song

1533
01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:06.530
<v 14>in instant family that was written I believe for Chris Gaines,</v>

1534
01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:09.500
really not performed by Chris Gaines,
but there isn't for him.

1535
01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:13.580
There's this beautiful song that we use near the end of the movie called it

1536
01:37:13.581 --> 01:37:14.780
don't matter to the sun.

1537
01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:18.890
And I think the first appearance of that song was on the Chris Gaines record and

1538
01:37:18.891 --> 01:37:22.910
then it was later.
It was later covered by Don Henley and um,

1539
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:25.640
I think Stevie nicks or I can't remember exactly who could,

1540
01:37:25.641 --> 01:37:27.390
maybe it was just Don Henley and we definitely,
yeah,

1541
01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:30.620
<v 4>some Chris Gaines stuff hundreds of episodes before,</v>

1542
01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:35.280
but we've been talking about Garth so much that people have asked,
uh,

1543
01:37:35.290 --> 01:37:39.920
you know more about them.
I love this so much,
this era that we're going into,

1544
01:37:40.630 --> 01:37:42.890
I'm so,
I'm enthralled with him.

1545
01:37:42.891 --> 01:37:46.580
I'm fascinated by the psychology of this.
He's a fascinating person.

1546
01:37:46.581 --> 01:37:49.430
Here is a social media,
so people don't know.
Garth,

1547
01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:53.130
years ago got sick of his successful career as Garth Brooks.
Yes.

1548
01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:56.580
Decided he was going to play a alter ego.
Chris Gaines,

1549
01:37:56.580 --> 01:38:00.900
<v 19>whose parents had died and he was doing different types of music.</v>

1550
01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:02.280
I didn't know there was a backstory

1551
01:38:02.690 --> 01:38:07.460
<v 12>question that I get about Chris Gaines is what's it like to play to different</v>

1552
01:38:07.461 --> 01:38:10.420
people?
And the answer is,
first let's get one thing straight.

1553
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:13.510
I'm not playing two different places.
If people I'm playing one,
uh,

1554
01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:16.010
the Garth Brooks thing,
it's just who I am.

1555
01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:17.780
<v 19>Oh,</v>

1556
01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:21.470
<v 12>Chris Gaines thing though,
the closer you look and the more you find out,</v>

1557
01:38:21.471 --> 01:38:23.870
you realize Chris Gaines is Garth,

1558
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:29.310
so all it is is a stretching of the arms and all it is is taking Garth Brooks

1559
01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:33.110
and Chris Gaines and putting them together the same way.

1560
01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:38.140
We took a song from sixties and the 90s and put them together to create a new

1561
01:38:38.361 --> 01:38:39.380
song for the millennium.

1562
01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:43.850
It's probably the crossroads where Garth and Chris meet dead on and probably the

1563
01:38:43.851 --> 01:38:45.260
most,
they're like,

1564
01:38:47.250 --> 01:38:51.240
<v 19>oh no,
this is the most sincere I've ever seen him.
When he's talking.
Well,</v>

1565
01:38:51.241 --> 01:38:55.560
you know,
why do you know why?
Because Chris Gaines is his shadow self.

1566
01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:58.860
It's the darkness inside of him that he's finally addressing.

1567
01:38:58.950 --> 01:39:03.160
So when he's talking about the darkness,
he's alive.
One of my favorite love it.

1568
01:39:03.370 --> 01:39:06.240
That's actually a really good 10 years in psychotherapy.
Go ahead.

1569
01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:09.420
Also the Garth Brooks character,

1570
01:39:09.540 --> 01:39:14.460
even though he says that's just him,
my assumption is that it's him,

1571
01:39:14.461 --> 01:39:17.040
but it's also anytime you have a public persona like that,

1572
01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:22.140
that's a lot of work to kind of cap to keep that up and to be the,

1573
01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:25.200
well that's why it looks,
it seems what I'm telling you,

1574
01:39:25.230 --> 01:39:29.070
it feels contrived and more than anything it feels exhausting because there's

1575
01:39:29.071 --> 01:39:31.980
nothing natural about it.
Like he doesn't go like,
Hey,
I'm coming to your city.

1576
01:39:31.981 --> 01:39:36.040
He's like,
hi,
coming to your city.
I'm real.

1577
01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:39.600
I love y'all so much.
I just want world peace.
And you're like,
all right man.

1578
01:39:39.630 --> 01:39:43.350
Like no one talks like that.
Sounds like you're in a beauty pageant contest.

1579
01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:46.990
It feels forced.
I'm not saying he's not a nice guy.

1580
01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:50.130
I'm sure you think about them,
but,
but I just know that was especially,

1581
01:39:50.131 --> 01:39:53.760
I mean the guy was like the Michael Jordan of country music for like 10 years.

1582
01:39:53.790 --> 01:39:56.280
Oh yeah.
And uh,
so,
you know,

1583
01:39:56.281 --> 01:39:59.570
to just keep that up has got to be exhausting.
So to,

1584
01:39:59.650 --> 01:40:03.570
to just pretend like you're somebody else for a while had to be like the most

1585
01:40:03.571 --> 01:40:07.920
funny,
bad,
you know,
he took so much time off.
He took a famous,
he is,

1586
01:40:07.921 --> 01:40:11.160
he took a lot of time off,
um,
to,

1587
01:40:11.161 --> 01:40:15.930
I think it was to raise the kids as well.
I'm sure it was just a very bodies,

1588
01:40:15.931 --> 01:40:20.790
but it was,
he was taking,
raising kids and then now he's back on tour.

1589
01:40:20.791 --> 01:40:25.650
He's doing stadium football stadiums and they are selling out like in an hour,

1590
01:40:25.710 --> 01:40:30.710
like stadiums.
But this was him also explaining how he,
uh,

1591
01:40:30.750 --> 01:40:32.580
photographs differently for Chris Gaines.

1592
01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:34.300
<v 12>The hard thing about the plane,</v>

1593
01:40:34.301 --> 01:40:39.301
Chris Gaines as actual person that you're filming is for a guy that's 220 pounds

1594
01:40:39.821 --> 01:40:44.821
to try and look small and Chris's this supposedly kind of a smaller built

1595
01:40:45.701 --> 01:40:48.870
artists.
So in all the pictures,
it's easy.

1596
01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:52.810
Go see photos of you suck your cheeks and your face becomes real thin.

1597
01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:54.693
You can do that.

1598
01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:58.000
The problem is I may start seeing these bigger cheeks come out again.

1599
01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:04.720
We know Chris will be the first one to tell you when his biography that he's had

1600
01:41:04.751 --> 01:41:09.720
a lot of great relationships that he has personally thrown away himself.
So,
uh,

1601
01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:13.530
when it comes to women and when it comes to commitment,
Yup.

1602
01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:15.520
He's not really the first guy in Russia.

1603
01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:21.160
<v 19>Shadow self.
There is a darkness.
This,
uh,</v>

1604
01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:27.100
like a Vegas,
like not a,
you know,
not an Andy Kaufman thing,
but like,
uh,
you know,

1605
01:41:27.101 --> 01:41:31.720
you should do a skinny guy,
cool guy.
Like not that you're not skinny and cool,

1606
01:41:31.721 --> 01:41:34.000
but right here you should do like a,
you know,

1607
01:41:34.001 --> 01:41:37.730
you should do an alter ego comic with long hair.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1608
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:42.610
It just does like really,
you know,
stuff that only 15 year olds get right.

1609
01:41:42.611 --> 01:41:46.420
You know?
Yeah.
You have rodeo.
Yeah.
I did do Rodeo for a while.

1610
01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:49.780
I don't know this one.
Rodeo,
uh,

1611
01:41:49.810 --> 01:41:54.810
would do urban rooms and even wear oversized white tee shirts.

1612
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:59.100
He had like a pencil,
thin beer and then he had a call,
he'll go,
hey,

1613
01:41:59.110 --> 01:42:01.970
ho Rodeo.
So like for the punch,

1614
01:42:03.810 --> 01:42:07.480
but I would do only like hack premises.
Like you got to hit your kids,
man.

1615
01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:13.300
Yeah.
You probably make a fortune though right now.
Yes.
Just blow,

1616
01:42:13.370 --> 01:42:16.270
blow myself out of the water.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like my age was like,

1617
01:42:16.271 --> 01:42:19.780
you've got to stop touring as yourself.
Yeah.
They don't want that anymore.

1618
01:42:19.950 --> 01:42:23.650
And he stuck with Brianna.
Oh,
can I say before I forget,
I was so excited.

1619
01:42:23.651 --> 01:42:27.850
This is so corny,
but so excited to hear about house and your mood.
Oh,

1620
01:42:28.270 --> 01:42:32.860
third uncle dude.
He's the greatest ever again.
Only other person.

1621
01:42:32.890 --> 01:42:36.290
Only person to ever mentioned that.
Yeah.
What a great song.
Very observant.
Yeah.

1622
01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:40.060
Are you,
do you like golf music?
Is that where you got that?
I don't know.

1623
01:42:40.061 --> 01:42:43.120
Not Goth music that you'd like.
I'm not like,
you know,
uh,

1624
01:42:43.150 --> 01:42:45.210
an aging goth or anything,
but I did really,

1625
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:49.690
I always really loved about how send Peter Murphy and love and rockets and,
yeah.

1626
01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:54.180
What the fuck now,
how did you that's I didn't know.
Oh good.
I love that stuff.

1627
01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:57.280
Both used to go to the lesbian clubs.
A lot of do you mean the clubs?

1628
01:42:57.820 --> 01:43:02.440
The golf club.
Wow.
I was so impressed because I never hear,

1629
01:43:02.441 --> 01:43:05.430
I'm never heard that song in a movie.
And I was like Tommy,
that's Bauhaus.

1630
01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:07.480
That's about,
that's such a great,
oh,
exciting.
Yeah.

1631
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:13.250
<v 12>No I didn't say that.
Chris said that.
Oh it's better.</v>

1632
01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:15.050
So anyway,

1633
01:43:15.590 --> 01:43:19.070
this guy comes out with this long hair and he hides up for three or four years

1634
01:43:19.071 --> 01:43:22.460
cause he's really not happy with his face,
which upset me.
But you know,

1635
01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:27.290
and you kind of look like Prince.
Yeah.

1636
01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:32.290
Except this guy gained a lot of weight after the,
Oh,

1637
01:43:32.330 --> 01:43:34.610
so this is explaining to Chris.
Look,

1638
01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:39.530
he's what he looks like showing them the checks 11.
Yeah,
of course.

1639
01:43:42.460 --> 01:43:46.240
<v 19>Okay.
Is that the unveil?
Oh yeah.
If that was unveiling Chris Gaines audience.</v>

1640
01:43:46.241 --> 01:43:50.130
Yeah.
That's bizarre.
It's just,
no,
Shawn was saying he has,
he has,

1641
01:43:50.230 --> 01:43:55.040
he can't put any to,
um,
people were,
he's heard on our show.

1642
01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.340
<v 13>Oh,
see,
I don't,
I don't want this</v>

1643
01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:05.900
know the first time anyone's ever said that on her show.
I listened.

1644
01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:08.160
I was saying the time that I only

1645
01:44:08.290 --> 01:44:10.750
<v 19>here your show cause I'm always driving when I'm listening to it.</v>

1646
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:12.970
So I haven't seen any of these linear tech center,

1647
01:44:13.230 --> 01:44:17.450
but the pictures in my mind are,
are at frankly worse than that,
so.
Okay.

1648
01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:19.260
Okay.
All right.
I got it.

1649
01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:24.480
<v 20>How's on asphalt bell and their SAS.
Dot.</v>

1650
01:44:24.481 --> 01:44:28.470
Barkow Woo.
I want to see if I can't,

1651
01:44:29.070 --> 01:44:30.120
I gotta be careful here.

1652
01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:35.080
<v 13>Sorry Jesus.
I can't believe him.
Biggest takeaway.
I want to see that guy.</v>

1653
01:44:35.330 --> 01:44:38.120
You don't want to see the forest road guy.
Do you have

1654
01:44:38.250 --> 01:44:42.260
<v 19>of research person that digs for this stuff or is it all you?
No,
no,
no.
We have a,</v>

1655
01:44:42.300 --> 01:44:46.410
we would now have to staff.
Um,
so people will send in emails,

1656
01:44:46.411 --> 01:44:48.810
your mom's podcast@gmail.com.

1657
01:44:49.260 --> 01:44:53.370
It sometimes gets like 5,000 plus emails a week.

1658
01:44:53.860 --> 01:44:56.370
I know.
And that they have to,

1659
01:44:56.430 --> 01:44:58.790
we'll have to work at in tandem to just dig through.

1660
01:44:58.860 --> 01:45:01.570
Have you told the story on your show about when the video,

1661
01:45:01.710 --> 01:45:06.570
when the trailer for the movie first hit?
Um,
well,

1662
01:45:06.571 --> 01:45:11.070
there's a couple things that are pretty funny happened recently.

1663
01:45:11.071 --> 01:45:14.280
There's the trailer,
which is now,
by the way,
that trailer,

1664
01:45:14.730 --> 01:45:18.420
if we do a youtube,
let's see,
um,

1665
01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:23.280
instant family.
It is 100%.
Uh,

1666
01:45:23.490 --> 01:45:28.210
it has 10 million views.
The trailers,
I mean for a trailer,
right?
It's,

1667
01:45:28.630 --> 01:45:30.380
it's pretty nutty.
Um,

1668
01:45:32.230 --> 01:45:33.750
<v 13>he's a really special,</v>

1669
01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:35.970
what kind of people who volunteer with just not even a holiday.

1670
01:45:36.210 --> 01:45:37.110
We don't even volunteer.

1671
01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:40.610
<v 7>Holiday
over a half moon.</v>

1672
01:45:40.611 --> 01:45:42.500
Children are currently in foster care.

1673
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:47.330
The county puts his arm because they can match a lot of kids and parents quickly

1674
01:45:47.420 --> 01:45:49.340
look at the big kiss.
Everybody's avoiding.

1675
01:45:49.341 --> 01:45:51.750
I was going to go and say hi if they're teenagers.
Okay.

1676
01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:54.350
There just drugs and they watch people playing video games and Youtube.

1677
01:45:54.351 --> 01:45:57.170
We're not equipped for any of that.
Just Fyi.

1678
01:45:57.280 --> 01:45:59.620
<v 13>Can all hear you?
Hmm.
Okay.</v>

1679
01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:03.190
Let me go with the kitties and don't give it another thought.
Bye.
Bye.

1680
01:46:03.850 --> 01:46:08.230
She was cool.
Lizzy comes with two younger siblings.
Three kids,

1681
01:46:08.380 --> 01:46:13.360
two mice.
Oh my God,
why would you show us that's wrong.

1682
01:46:15.690 --> 01:46:19.650
<v 7>Make yourself at home because you're at home.
Do you like more of a Lakers fan?</v>

1683
01:46:21.170 --> 01:46:24.590
<v 13>Oh No,
you hit me because I like the clippers and the clippers are awesome.</v>

1684
01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:26.120
They were smart for trading.
Blake Griffin.

1685
01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:31.830
<v 7>Just stay there until the fire department comes.
Okay.</v>

1686
01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:36.280
<v 19>All right.
There's um,
this trailer has almost 11 million views now.</v>

1687
01:46:37.090 --> 01:46:41.620
And if you go in here,
look,
the third comment,

1688
01:46:42.100 --> 01:46:46.080
Tommi bonds,
I want,
no,
I want this out right now.
Right now,
this is from art show,

1689
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:50.310
but I know a deep adopt me feed me,
try it out.

1690
01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:54.930
<v 0>Highest and Titus trailer I've ever seen.
So here's what happened.</v>

1691
01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:59.510
<v 14>The marketing people at paramount,
wonderful people,
good people,</v>

1692
01:46:59.690 --> 01:47:03.920
they're very nice.
But they,
they,
they put up the trailer and you know,

1693
01:47:03.921 --> 01:47:07.490
it's always kind of like,
okay,
they worked really hard on this thing to try to,

1694
01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:07.970
you know,

1695
01:47:07.970 --> 01:47:11.780
get the message across of what the movie is and then they want to see how people

1696
01:47:11.781 --> 01:47:14.270
react to it.
And the reactions were really,
really positive,

1697
01:47:14.271 --> 01:47:19.271
but mixed in were all of these cryptic was on from,

1698
01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:22.460
from your fans.
And they were like,

1699
01:47:22.770 --> 01:47:25.370
and it took everybody like a few beats to be like,

1700
01:47:25.371 --> 01:47:27.500
what's going on with this trait?

1701
01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:31.750
What the hell is high and tight?
And,
uh,

1702
01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:35.450
and then they called me to tell me,
um,

1703
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:39.250
that I I knew at that point but they called me to tell me those are just Tom

1704
01:47:39.250 --> 01:47:43.490
Segura is fans.
They love him.
And,
and uh,
I,
it was,
it's been really fun.

1705
01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:45.070
And now with people,

1706
01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:50.090
what I love is that there are these great people have been posting these great,

1707
01:47:50.420 --> 01:47:52.850
you know,
your fans have been posting these great,
you know,

1708
01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:58.000
things on Instagram or whatever that are sort of admitting that as cynical as

1709
01:47:59.060 --> 01:48:00.170
kind of humor that they liked.

1710
01:48:00.350 --> 01:48:03.590
They are so many of them are really digging the movie and obviously loving

1711
01:48:03.620 --> 01:48:05.450
Thomas.
And I think,
cause there's real,

1712
01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:09.050
that moment I was discussing earlier with a,
they're like,
oh my God,

1713
01:48:09.051 --> 01:48:13.770
what have we done?
There's real moments of,
it's funny,
but it's also real plate.

1714
01:48:13.780 --> 01:48:18.570
There's nothing corny about this movie.
Do you know what I'm saying?
Oh God,

1715
01:48:18.930 --> 01:48:19.880
it's really good.

1716
01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:21.370
<v 0>Genuine.
It had to,</v>

1717
01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:26.430
they finally got to editing some of the IMD be a trivia,

1718
01:48:27.421 --> 01:48:32.421
which for a month just name it was.

1719
01:48:33.150 --> 01:48:35.940
Yeah,
it was just,
yeah,
I'm on that right now there though.

1720
01:48:35.970 --> 01:48:40.970
The top piece of Trivia still says Tom who stars as Russ was famously known as

1721
01:48:41.431 --> 01:48:45.480
the water champion as well as beating the world's fattest man Bark Grizzler

1722
01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:48.150
weight loss.
That's obviously not true

1723
01:48:50.290 --> 01:48:54.330
or that's not trivia for movie fans.
Kind of is.

1724
01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:55.440
This right here.

1725
01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:02.000
This is just an actual review of the film based on a true story by a director

1726
01:49:03.211 --> 01:49:06.960
Shawn Andrews at home family life.
It's a full review of it.

1727
01:49:06.990 --> 01:49:09.330
The film is bolstered by a strong supporting cast.

1728
01:49:09.331 --> 01:49:13.740
Tom Cigarette keeps things high and tight as the impishly maniacal husband of

1729
01:49:13.741 --> 01:49:16.530
Ellie's baby,
crazy sister.
It is a small role,

1730
01:49:16.531 --> 01:49:21.531
but I notable one as Sigora efforts effortlessly adapts his warmly sociopathic,

1731
01:49:22.051 --> 01:49:24.690
comedic stylings,
unbelievable.

1732
01:49:25.220 --> 01:49:29.370
And then they code go onto like write a really great review but unbelievable how

1733
01:49:29.371 --> 01:49:32.190
you guys,
I love warmly sociopathic.

1734
01:49:33.300 --> 01:49:35.730
Everyone's hitting me up with that right now.
So yeah,

1735
01:49:35.790 --> 01:49:38.870
I don't know that anybody's ever been described that way.
Yeah.
And I don't know.

1736
01:49:38.871 --> 01:49:42.070
I wouldn't ever will be not an easy thing to be warmly associates.

1737
01:49:42.570 --> 01:49:45.390
This show started kind of uniquely like that.
What did she say?

1738
01:49:45.391 --> 01:49:48.160
Tommy was started as like

1739
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:52.930
<v 14>a dance between it.
Originally it was Tommy and I playing GG Allen.</v>

1740
01:49:52.990 --> 01:49:56.710
Do you know Gigi?
Yeah.
Yeah.
We love that documentary.

1741
01:49:57.010 --> 01:49:59.840
Hated so good.
And then we played another documentary.

1742
01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:03.810
Stevie all sort started the dark weird.
We like Stevia.

1743
01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:06.910
And then what happened is that there is people that were like,
yes,

1744
01:50:06.911 --> 01:50:08.140
we like weird too.

1745
01:50:08.141 --> 01:50:11.290
And then they kept emailing it and then we kept playing it and now it's,

1746
01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:15.740
it's listener generating,
enjoying show that he does Milana.

1747
01:50:16.780 --> 01:50:18.120
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1748
01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:25.860
I know that.
Or you'll take a lot out of you.
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1749
01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:29.510
yeah.
Don't watch that at the beginning of your weekend.
Yeah.

1750
01:50:29.570 --> 01:50:31.670
<v 13>Wow.
When you woke up to a rattlesnake.</v>

1751
01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:36.040
<v 14>Crazy.
Yeah.
Um,
okay.
So here's the other way.</v>

1752
01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:39.280
If you guys ever seen my brother's keeper,
wait,

1753
01:50:39.550 --> 01:50:42.870
is that about a slow adult?
Sorry,

1754
01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:45.260
what's about these three old men in upstate New York?

1755
01:50:45.261 --> 01:50:48.880
I lived on a farm and one of them murdered the other one.

1756
01:50:49.870 --> 01:50:54.190
Put it on your list.
It's very darkly disturbing.
Interesting.

1757
01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:57.850
Just that weird.
I guarantee a lot of your listeners a little bit about,

1758
01:50:57.900 --> 01:51:02.410
I'm talking,
by the way,
did ted,
you seen tip toes?
I know,

1759
01:51:02.411 --> 01:51:04.750
you know it's funny,
I was just,
as I was driving over here,

1760
01:51:04.751 --> 01:51:06.460
I hadn't caught the last episode yet,

1761
01:51:06.461 --> 01:51:11.440
so I was just catching up on the last episode.
That is,
are you making that up?

1762
01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:12.453
Is that,

1763
01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:16.620
that sounded like as I thought they must have just cut something together.

1764
01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:20.170
Seemed like,
now I will say this.
Um,

1765
01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:23.560
has that happened?
How does that movie get me?
Well,

1766
01:51:23.561 --> 01:51:25.900
and the funny thing is when you said the date,
you said like,

1767
01:51:25.930 --> 01:51:26.940
oh three or something,

1768
01:51:27.210 --> 01:51:31.950
which doesn't seem long ago enough for that to have happened.

1769
01:51:32.130 --> 01:51:35.770
No,
because if you hadn't told me that,
oh yeah,
in 1983 they did this and be like,

1770
01:51:35.771 --> 01:51:40.030
all right,
right.
But really permissible in 83.
Well,
and they said,
I mean,

1771
01:51:40.031 --> 01:51:44.020
at least this was later.
They want.
Somebody said that the,

1772
01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:47.230
there was a cut of the movie that was actually great.
And you know,

1773
01:51:47.231 --> 01:51:51.730
that happens with right,
gets fired.
And then the studios like edit it like this.

1774
01:51:51.731 --> 01:51:55.900
And I mean not to tip toes.
I mean they know.
This is really,

1775
01:51:56.630 --> 01:51:59.470
I see.
I only heard it,
I didn't see it together.
It was perfect.

1776
01:52:00.140 --> 01:52:01.570
<v 13>Oh,
weird.
To me,
the blow job,</v>

1777
01:52:01.590 --> 01:52:05.500
I've got to get going like this right in the trailer.
Yeah,
it's a bit forward.

1778
01:52:05.810 --> 01:52:06.643
You know,

1779
01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:13.320
there's one small problem and the voiceover,
Sarah Monroe,
I'm his brother.

1780
01:52:13.470 --> 01:52:18.210
We're twins and it's Gary Oldman's carry homes.
Parents.
Wait,
that's Gary Oldman.

1781
01:52:18.260 --> 01:52:21.330
I'll do a little gut.
Yeah,
it can tear them apart.

1782
01:52:21.650 --> 01:52:25.500
I you kind of let me know that everyone in your pants is images or not images.

1783
01:52:25.501 --> 01:52:28.400
Carolyn doors bring them together.

1784
01:52:28.750 --> 01:52:32.320
<v 14>And the voiceover,
I was so obsessed with like the,</v>

1785
01:52:33.210 --> 01:52:38.140
like the like comedy sounding like,
it's like,
like if you were making a parody,

1786
01:52:38.141 --> 01:52:39.510
you would have this guy right over

1787
01:52:41.650 --> 01:52:45.650
<v 13>welcome.
I'm Steven are just the Steven's father,</v>

1788
01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:48.600
ms mom,
Kathleen,
and over behind the bar students.

1789
01:52:48.601 --> 01:52:53.000
By the time he could've prepared us for this study.
Think Bass me,

1790
01:52:53.001 --> 01:52:54.530
I'll never speak to cancer.
She's get it together

1791
01:52:56.810 --> 01:52:59.150
<v 19>and they treat them like they're like,
you have aliens.
I know</v>

1792
01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:04.610
people.
Yeah.
It's like,
like,
I mean these people with disabilities.

1793
01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:09.260
Fuck no heads up on that.
You could have told me he's in a wheelchair.

1794
01:53:09.940 --> 01:53:10.773
Right.

1795
01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:15.360
<v 13>That's the weird stuff.
It's only the size of your heart that counts.</v>

1796
01:53:15.690 --> 01:53:17.840
Make it that big of a deal.
If a kid does it work,

1797
01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.600
you're not telling this great girl and you didn't tell her that her baby's

1798
01:53:20.610 --> 01:53:24.150
probably going to be lit.
I'm not like you.
We also cute and cuddly.

1799
01:53:24.170 --> 01:53:26.220
Don't discriminate against us.

1800
01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:30.000
<v 19>Well,
they're also southern and little,
which is interesting.</v>

1801
01:53:30.001 --> 01:53:33.480
Gary Oldman is English,
right?
Yes.
Wow.

1802
01:53:33.510 --> 01:53:36.630
Well Peter Dinklage right there had like a French accent where he was a friend

1803
01:53:36.631 --> 01:53:38.580
and you know,
choices.
They let them make choices.
You know,

1804
01:53:38.581 --> 01:53:39.680
what was the occasion or something?

1805
01:53:41.070 --> 01:53:44.490
I guess he just got nowhere to what Matthew mcconaughey.

1806
01:53:44.830 --> 01:53:48.720
<v 21>Um,
I believe he play twin brothers with we.
Yes.</v>

1807
01:53:48.721 --> 01:53:53.280
I was his smaller twain.
This is tip toes,

1808
01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:57.120
tip toe,
which he played the tour.
I did play it off.
How was that experience?

1809
01:53:57.360 --> 01:54:02.130
It was um,
you know what it was,
it was,
uh,
I must say it was a little,

1810
01:54:02.430 --> 01:54:06.900
it was a little strange.
It didn't turn out as well as we thought it might.

1811
01:54:07.110 --> 01:54:11.850
It's one of those where you,
I mean it's all a roll of the dice I guess,

1812
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:16.890
but you know,
it's not my finest hour on Salvia Lloyd.

1813
01:54:18.830 --> 01:54:22.880
<v 19>I really wonder because it is an incredible shame if,
because you know,</v>

1814
01:54:22.881 --> 01:54:26.210
you've seen where they take the shining and they recut the trailer and make it

1815
01:54:26.211 --> 01:54:27.760
look like a romantic comedy.
Yeah.

1816
01:54:27.980 --> 01:54:32.980
And it is amazing what can be done with music and cuts and whatever.

1817
01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:37.820
And it would be really heartbreaking to have to find out that this was some

1818
01:54:37.821 --> 01:54:40.890
beautiful movie.
Peter Dinklage said that it was a,
yeah,

1819
01:54:40.891 --> 01:54:44.660
you said that he said that it was a trailer was cut in properly.
Well,

1820
01:54:44.661 --> 01:54:48.680
he said the film ended up getting,
like the studio changed the entire film,

1821
01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:50.420
but there was a cut of that was,

1822
01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:54.230
he said it was great and that it just completely got to get ahold of this
though.

1823
01:54:55.010 --> 01:54:56.630
Yeah,
but the title

1824
01:54:56.670 --> 01:54:58.650
<v 21>low to range,</v>

1825
01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:03.680
because I spent all the shooting time on my knees with and I worked with,

1826
01:55:04.770 --> 01:55:09.660
with real little paypal,
you know,
so I would say,

1827
01:55:09.661 --> 01:55:13.330
okay,
that's,
you know,
one hour lunch and I would stand up.

1828
01:55:15.070 --> 01:55:18.340
<v 19>I thought the thing that made me think it was a parody when it was just</v>

1829
01:55:18.341 --> 01:55:23.240
listening to it was the title and the way the guy said this idol tip toe.
Yeah.

1830
01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:27.880
Yeah.
It's like an SNL.
It does it.
Does it seem Marie?
Oh Man.

1831
01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:36.950
Okay.
Are you ready to do it?
What would I ask you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right.

1832
01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:39.730
This is what I was telling you.
I don't know why I agreed to do this.

1833
01:55:39.731 --> 01:55:43.860
This is my idea.
She was greeted with yourself.
I agree with to do this,

1834
01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:46.560
<v 14>but the reason I think,
I think I did it because I actually,</v>

1835
01:55:46.561 --> 01:55:51.540
when you like someone you don't mind feeling vulnerable around crying and all I

1836
01:55:51.541 --> 01:55:54.900
do is make fun of people.
You know,
we make fun of people.

1837
01:55:55.230 --> 01:55:58.860
So I feel like this could be so embarrassing,
but you know,

1838
01:55:58.890 --> 01:56:03.390
I'm just going to go for it.
I asked Sean to pull my audition.

1839
01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:10.050
Oh my God.
I'm embarrassed.
I'm embarrassed right now.
I'm shaking.
So she blushing.

1840
01:56:10.051 --> 01:56:13.680
I am,
uh,
it's,
it's,
it's mortifying.
Can't watch that.

1841
01:56:13.681 --> 01:56:18.360
See no sign.
So painful to watch these things.
I know,

1842
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:23.230
but I'm probably,
you probably did great.
Thank,
I don't know.
I did.
Um,

1843
01:56:23.380 --> 01:56:25.920
additions are so harsh.
We had a telestrator for this.

1844
01:56:28.740 --> 01:56:31.320
Uh,
okay.
Hold on,
hold on.

1845
01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:38.190
Uh,
do you do a lot of auditions?
I not a lot,

1846
01:56:38.191 --> 01:56:41.910
but sometimes if I like it,
yeah.
Do you know if I do?

1847
01:56:42.060 --> 01:56:45.270
My sister's an actor.
And so what we do when we,

1848
01:56:45.300 --> 01:56:49.830
when we run auditions is we always have a note out in the lobby that just lets

1849
01:56:49.831 --> 01:56:53.550
people know you're coming into a friendly room.
We're like,

1850
01:56:53.730 --> 01:56:56.580
we just let him know that,
hey,
if you want to try some things,

1851
01:56:56.610 --> 01:57:00.330
like whatever you want to do is cool with us.
Because I just,
when I,

1852
01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:01.770
when I have to audition people,

1853
01:57:01.771 --> 01:57:05.370
I feel like the biggest jerk in the world because it's just one person after

1854
01:57:05.371 --> 01:57:08.980
another coming in and we're just destroy their dreams.
One,
one after it all.

1855
01:57:10.300 --> 01:57:14.530
I had to prepare characters and sketches and things.

1856
01:57:14.980 --> 01:57:18.480
The Perth,
the casting person will be typing the entire time and I'm like,

1857
01:57:18.481 --> 01:57:21.320
I smell that's like a week preparing these,
you know,

1858
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:24.740
I've had somebody,
um,

1859
01:57:25.290 --> 01:57:28.880
I've had somebody read emails as I was auditioning for them.
Yeah,
that's,

1860
01:57:28.890 --> 01:57:31.560
that's the worst.
Yeah.
This is my Julia,

1861
01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:39.270
this is my version though.
Julius is Mike.
Good Morning Julia.
Okay,

1862
01:57:39.350 --> 01:57:41.700
so the reason I asked him to do this,
because Sean,

1863
01:57:41.701 --> 01:57:44.610
actually one thing that never happens when you auditioned for anything is that

1864
01:57:44.611 --> 01:57:48.090
you talked to the director afterwards and he tells you about the audition.

1865
01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:51.700
You know what I mean?
How it went.
Very rare you don't get to hear any,

1866
01:57:51.701 --> 01:57:54.720
you never hear.
And I'm Elaine by the way.
To be clear,

1867
01:57:54.721 --> 01:57:58.470
that's what's so brutal about auditioning is that you have to go in for,

1868
01:57:59.060 --> 01:58:02.040
and you can't blow it off.
You have to go in and prepared if you,

1869
01:58:02.041 --> 01:58:05.730
if you want to have a shot at it.
And so often on our side of it,

1870
01:58:05.731 --> 01:58:08.940
we're looking for something really specific.
So more often than not,

1871
01:58:08.941 --> 01:58:10.850
as soon as somebody walks in the door,
you're like,
ah,

1872
01:58:11.380 --> 01:58:12.720
you just know they're not quite right.

1873
01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:16.170
And every now and then somebody will surprise you and you'll go,
oh,
okay,

1874
01:58:16.171 --> 01:58:20.880
this isn't what we had in mind,
but this is different.
This is cool.
Um,
but it's,

1875
01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:24.690
it really is.
I told my sister,
I said,
you need to,

1876
01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:27.180
to be a reader at auditions.

1877
01:58:27.181 --> 01:58:30.720
It'll take the pressure off because you just see one person after another coming

1878
01:58:30.721 --> 01:58:34.440
in.
And the best thing you can know going in,
especially for the colder,

1879
01:58:34.441 --> 01:58:36.390
the audition is,
is just,
no,
you're not getting it.

1880
01:58:36.420 --> 01:58:40.170
Just go in just knowing this and just gives a show,
be nervous.

1881
01:58:40.171 --> 01:58:43.780
Just have a good time with it.
And because if you do,
you do.
And you know,

1882
01:58:44.230 --> 01:58:48.610
but it's,
it's rough.
It is rough.
It's interesting what Joe Rogan,
I,

1883
01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:51.460
when I just did his podcast a couple weeks back was saying,
uh,

1884
01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:55.150
you just can't really give a shit when you go in for auditioning,

1885
01:58:55.450 --> 01:58:59.460
auditioning auditions,
like for fear factor.
He kind of went in,

1886
01:58:59.470 --> 01:59:02.660
he was saying as a joke,
he's like,
is this real?
Yeah.

1887
01:59:02.710 --> 01:59:05.550
And he was kind of shitting on it and they're like,
you're the guy.
Yeah.

1888
01:59:06.530 --> 01:59:08.780
<v 0>I think the thing is too,
it's like you,
um,</v>

1889
01:59:10.190 --> 01:59:14.780
like even talking to Sean about the,
this mood,
like right before I would,

1890
01:59:14.781 --> 01:59:15.080
you know,

1891
01:59:15.080 --> 01:59:19.580
read the script and he would give me some insight about like another character,

1892
01:59:20.180 --> 01:59:23.510
like,
oh yeah,
but the person who plays that should be like this.
And I was like,

1893
01:59:23.540 --> 01:59:26.930
ah,
I see.
I didn't even pick up on that.
Rereading this reading.

1894
01:59:26.931 --> 01:59:28.300
I read your script and I,

1895
01:59:28.350 --> 01:59:31.880
and I thought that this part should be played by this type of actor.

1896
01:59:32.210 --> 01:59:35.900
And he was like,
well,
no,
because Bob a lot.
But hearing that insight about that.

1897
01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:38.330
Yeah,
totally made me go like,
oh,
see,
like I,

1898
01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:43.250
I didn't even know how that part should,
we played method on set.

1899
01:59:43.280 --> 01:59:45.710
I was very [inaudible] people couldn't hear him talk to him.
Okay.

1900
01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:49.310
You wear that jacket the whole time.
This is a,
this is fine.

1901
01:59:49.470 --> 01:59:50.790
I think this was my original.

1902
01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:53.370
<v 14>Oh my God,
I can't,
can I leave and can you read it?</v>

1903
01:59:53.400 --> 01:59:57.500
I know you're going to love this
because I feel you're,

1904
01:59:58.400 --> 01:59:59.950
yeah,
like I get it.

1905
02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:01.480
<v 0>Oh fuck.</v>

1906
02:00:03.930 --> 02:00:08.040
<v 13>Halfway across town to see the shingle play.
Just having a little vision.
I mean,</v>

1907
02:00:08.041 --> 02:00:12.580
once we exposed
the patio,

1908
02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:19.590
there's bunch of stripey shadow
structure.

1909
02:00:21.610 --> 02:00:24.820
Fantastic.
And if you have a baby,
I mean,
when you had a baby,

1910
02:00:24.930 --> 02:00:27.670
we are having a baby.
We are having

1911
02:00:30.020 --> 02:00:34.220
to manifest,
but what we want,

1912
02:00:34.221 --> 02:00:39.160
it wouldn't have been paying out.
You know,
I'm just playing.

1913
02:00:39.650 --> 02:00:42.380
It's gonna happen.
It's gonna happen.
Hey,

1914
02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:47.360
I know this place is so great.
Why don't you guys flip?
It's not bad.
I'm not,

1915
02:00:47.490 --> 02:00:48.940
I'm not more than fine.
This

1916
02:00:48.940 --> 02:00:53.350
<v 14>was what was wrong though,
right?
There's no,
no,
no.
We talked about,</v>

1917
02:00:53.351 --> 02:00:55.300
we talked about this.
Yeah.
So here's the,

1918
02:00:57.160 --> 02:01:00.280
here's the other thing that's funny about a lot of people don't realize about

1919
02:01:00.281 --> 02:01:02.680
auditions too,
is that f as the writers,

1920
02:01:02.830 --> 02:01:05.530
you're hearing people do the dialogue and they're always doing sort of like the

1921
02:01:05.531 --> 02:01:07.120
longest version of the scene.

1922
02:01:07.420 --> 02:01:11.080
And when you read a lot of people that really helps you to cut down the scenes

1923
02:01:11.081 --> 02:01:14.170
and figure out what to keep and what to let go of.
But the poor actors,

1924
02:01:14.350 --> 02:01:16.210
they've had to go and do like the longest,

1925
02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:19.270
most tedious version of shorting possible.
Um,

1926
02:01:19.450 --> 02:01:23.830
so that's part of what we're seeing here too.
But no.
So to give you some,

1927
02:01:24.670 --> 02:01:25.510
some insight on this,

1928
02:01:25.810 --> 02:01:29.860
I was on Skype while he was doing this and it wasn't bad.

1929
02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:33.730
There was nothing bad about that.
But,
but there was a problem with it.

1930
02:01:34.270 --> 02:01:37.450
And the problem was he wasn't warmly sociopathic.

1931
02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:43.820
No,
you don't.
You know what it was,
it was,
his jeans were loose.

1932
02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:46.040
It was missing his low resting heart rate.

1933
02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:50.150
That is what it was missing because he had,

1934
02:01:50.180 --> 02:01:53.870
but if you watch what he's doing,
he's,
he's good.
He's,
he's funny,

1935
02:01:53.871 --> 02:01:57.560
but he's just like,
he's trying harder than he tries,

1936
02:01:57.561 --> 02:02:02.561
requires the w cause cause what I really responded to when I saw his stand up

1937
02:02:03.050 --> 02:02:07.940
was I liked this kind of leaned back that he would say kind of sometimes

1938
02:02:07.941 --> 02:02:11.960
outrageous things,
but just say I'm like,
alright,
you know,
I just said that.

1939
02:02:11.961 --> 02:02:14.840
So what,
you know.
Right.
And then when he came in for the audition,

1940
02:02:14.841 --> 02:02:18.920
he was more like here,
like just sort of laying into it.
And I was like,
oh shoot.

1941
02:02:19.130 --> 02:02:21.620
But I didn't know cause he had been in anything else.

1942
02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:24.080
I didn't really have any frame of reference.
Is this,
oh,

1943
02:02:24.081 --> 02:02:29.010
is this just the choice or can he not do that?
Your resting heart rate.
Yeah.

1944
02:02:29.310 --> 02:02:33.840
<v 3>I love serial killer.
I mean I've never been in a movie.
Oh No.</v>

1945
02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:38.600
Uh,
but Phil,
I guess film acting too,
I mean your head is huge.

1946
02:02:38.660 --> 02:02:40.910
So minimal acting,
right?

1947
02:02:40.911 --> 02:02:44.680
Like you have to kind of play it smaller than you would if you were on stage.

1948
02:02:45.650 --> 02:02:46.620
Yeah,
I mean,
yes,

1949
02:02:46.750 --> 02:02:47.980
<v 14>no,
depending on what you're doing,</v>

1950
02:02:47.981 --> 02:02:50.560
sometimes you gotta go the other way because sometimes you know,

1951
02:02:50.860 --> 02:02:52.330
I think with this guy,
yeah,

1952
02:02:52.331 --> 02:02:57.330
he had to be bold without seeming like he was making an effort to be born.
Right.

1953
02:02:57.950 --> 02:03:02.830
Um,
because also his character is a little bit,
um,

1954
02:03:03.220 --> 02:03:07.510
dominated by his wife in,
in place.
Right.
So he had to be,
you know,

1955
02:03:07.511 --> 02:03:10.930
that guy who is just kind of that sort of devil may care guy.

1956
02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:15.200
But when he does care is when he just doesn't want to piss off his wife.
Wow.

1957
02:03:15.340 --> 02:03:17.860
You know,
um,
girls

1958
02:03:19.830 --> 02:03:24.790
aspects and Russ,
Danny don't go busted my balls on Turkey day.

1959
02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:27.660
<v 3>Okay.
It's hard to watch.</v>

1960
02:03:27.900 --> 02:03:32.760
I can't do it anymore.
Please.
She's asking me to stop.

1961
02:03:33.730 --> 02:03:37.100
I know what that is.
I've done these.
It's fucking mortified.

1962
02:03:37.710 --> 02:03:41.840
<v 14>The thing is,
you know,
a song like even asking you to send these,</v>

1963
02:03:41.850 --> 02:03:43.050
which I'm so happy you did.

1964
02:03:43.350 --> 02:03:47.850
I started to get that thing of like what if every audition I've ever done could

1965
02:03:47.851 --> 02:03:52.820
be accessed?
No.
How embarrassing would it be to showcase all your auditions?

1966
02:03:53.050 --> 02:03:56.490
Like,
cause this is one where ultimately it worked out right?

1967
02:03:56.491 --> 02:03:59.040
Cause like I booked a job but um,

1968
02:03:59.070 --> 02:04:01.650
I think about all the ones I went on where you walk out and you're like,

1969
02:04:01.651 --> 02:04:05.670
oh my God,
that was so bad.
Like when you know what's bad and what is that?

1970
02:04:05.970 --> 02:04:10.950
What is that in our brains anyway that does that to ourselves where it's like

1971
02:04:10.951 --> 02:04:14.130
you're doing this thing,
you're putting yourself out there,
you're,

1972
02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:16.440
you're being bald,
you're taking chances.
You're,

1973
02:04:16.441 --> 02:04:20.610
that's the only way you're getting anywhere near anything that,
that you know,

1974
02:04:20.611 --> 02:04:25.020
big in this world.
But we're so mortified by all of that.

1975
02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:29.010
I think you know what it is.
It's like,
I mean for I can I say it for this,

1976
02:04:29.011 --> 02:04:32.610
it's like you're,
you feel like you're,
when I'm showing this,

1977
02:04:32.611 --> 02:04:35.220
that I'm showing something where I was trying.
Yeah.

1978
02:04:35.370 --> 02:04:38.070
And sometimes the truth is

1979
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:41.940
<v 19>we all have these standards where you want to be seen as great without</v>

1980
02:04:42.210 --> 02:04:44.370
effortlessly.
Yes.
So you want to be like,

1981
02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:47.460
oh you want to see my audition and someone sees it and you want to feel like

1982
02:04:47.461 --> 02:04:49.650
everyone would be like,
that's amazing.
At anytime.

1983
02:04:49.710 --> 02:04:52.650
It's not that you kind of are a little bit,

1984
02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:55.830
depending on how far from that it is embarrassed by it,

1985
02:04:55.860 --> 02:05:00.030
you know you want it to be good.
I mean for Standup,
you know,
Oh God,

1986
02:05:00.031 --> 02:05:03.480
we at least get to showcase that one time where we prepare,

1987
02:05:03.481 --> 02:05:05.700
prepare and prepare and it's,
you know,

1988
02:05:05.701 --> 02:05:09.720
it's months of like preparing and you show that and you go like,

1989
02:05:09.750 --> 02:05:13.890
okay as well it's near as good as it can be.

1990
02:05:14.010 --> 02:05:17.550
And even then sometimes,
I mean if my standup came on right now I'd be like,
okay,

1991
02:05:17.551 --> 02:05:21.120
we can turn that off.
Like I don't want to see myself do it stand up.

1992
02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:24.450
I've always thought that this is what's really interesting about standup is that

1993
02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:30.060
a huge component of standup is being self deprecating of,

1994
02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:35.070
of acknowledging whatever your own folly is or whatever.
Right?

1995
02:05:35.071 --> 02:05:38.670
So you're supposed to be up there presenting like,
I dunno,

1996
02:05:38.730 --> 02:05:42.630
I'm just this regular goof ball of a person and this is just what I think about

1997
02:05:42.631 --> 02:05:46.340
things.
But at the same time you're supposed to be this entertainer and,

1998
02:05:46.341 --> 02:05:50.190
and you're supposed to be kind of cool on some level and it's a,

1999
02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:53.170
it's a tough balance to get all that to where,

2000
02:05:53.410 --> 02:05:56.760
and so much of it is just making all these people feel comfortable so that they

2001
02:05:56.761 --> 02:05:59.040
can laugh.
Right.
You know,
cause that's the thing,

2002
02:05:59.041 --> 02:06:01.860
like you've seen comics where they just,
they immediately,

2003
02:06:01.861 --> 02:06:03.780
they make you uncomfortable and you're like,
I don't,

2004
02:06:03.890 --> 02:06:06.470
it doesn't matter what this guy's going to say.
Yeah.

2005
02:06:06.480 --> 02:06:10.410
I just feel so bad for him right now.
Yeah.
No,

2006
02:06:10.530 --> 02:06:13.260
I mean I think thank God with standup at,
they'll probably with everything,

2007
02:06:13.261 --> 02:06:15.960
but with stand up,
you know,
the longer you're the one doing it,

2008
02:06:16.380 --> 02:06:19.420
you start to feel more comfortable with all the elements of it.
Right.

2009
02:06:19.470 --> 02:06:21.810
The performing and the writing and the,
you know what I mean?

2010
02:06:21.811 --> 02:06:25.110
But I had the dream to do it when I was younger and I didn't really,
the nerve,

2011
02:06:25.111 --> 02:06:27.780
I'm not going to lie to you,
I never had the nerve.
I was just like,

2012
02:06:27.970 --> 02:06:32.620
it's a healthy him.
That's what I loved.
That that was where you,

2013
02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:37.050
let me see what many different components to stand up that I think it's a

2014
02:06:37.051 --> 02:06:39.900
psychology game tail because you're reading the audience,

2015
02:06:39.901 --> 02:06:43.710
you're reading everything,
you're seeing them.
By the way,

2016
02:06:44.280 --> 02:06:48.240
one of the reasons I brought this up was that last week when Sean and I were on

2017
02:06:48.241 --> 02:06:51.630
Joe's thing,
he talked about how how it lit I lit,

2018
02:06:51.660 --> 02:06:56.280
I leaned into this one but then he actually called me and I remember I worked on

2019
02:06:56.310 --> 02:06:59.250
it.
I don't have any of those,

2020
02:06:59.670 --> 02:07:02.210
but I'm just want to see just two more sentences.

2021
02:07:09.640 --> 02:07:13.610
We got some news.
Okay.
Okay,
I see.
I see it now.

2022
02:07:13.920 --> 02:07:17.980
I do a little,
it was dialed up a little bit.
Was that up a little bit?
Yeah.
Yeah.

2023
02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:20.430
No,
so what happened was I,

2024
02:07:20.760 --> 02:07:23.820
I called him cause I was in Atlanta and I,

2025
02:07:23.821 --> 02:07:26.070
and the other thing was I also had really high hopes.

2026
02:07:26.071 --> 02:07:30.060
I was really excited that you were coming to read for Russ and I like you

2027
02:07:30.061 --> 02:07:33.990
already had the job
but you didn't.
But I did.

2028
02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:36.100
I saw it and I was like,
oh no,

2029
02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:38.950
<v 14>I don't know if this is going to work completely because</v>

2030
02:07:39.530 --> 02:07:41.990
<v 3>I need that.
I need that,
that,</v>

2031
02:07:42.890 --> 02:07:47.600
<v 14>that thing.
I need that,
that sort of relaxed vibe around it with this guy.</v>

2032
02:07:47.630 --> 02:07:49.820
And uh,
so then I called him and I said,

2033
02:07:49.821 --> 02:07:51.890
would you be willing to come and work on it?
And by the way,

2034
02:07:51.920 --> 02:07:54.980
that's also really cool for somebody to just say,
sure,

2035
02:07:54.981 --> 02:07:57.830
I'll take time out of my day and not knowing if I'm good at it.

2036
02:07:57.860 --> 02:08:02.090
And it's cool for someone to offer to work on it.
More importantly,

2037
02:08:02.091 --> 02:08:06.200
I think it's cool.
Yeah.
Well,
and what we did more than anything is really,

2038
02:08:06.500 --> 02:08:08.060
it's not like we were just practicing it all day.

2039
02:08:08.061 --> 02:08:10.130
We were mostly just talking about it.
Like you said,

2040
02:08:10.131 --> 02:08:13.520
just talking about the character,
talking about the movie.
And it was really fun.

2041
02:08:13.580 --> 02:08:15.500
And um,
you gave me this note

2042
02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:19.550
<v 19>by the way,
during filming a few times to like,
uh,</v>

2043
02:08:19.630 --> 02:08:24.060
just like throw it away to chill out,
lean back,
don't,
yeah.
You brought that up.

2044
02:08:24.061 --> 02:08:28.090
I remember that a few times.
Yeah.
Throw it away was was always good for us.
Yes.

2045
02:08:28.140 --> 02:08:32.790
Just let it get out there and don't,
you know,
but I like also,
just so you know,

2046
02:08:32.791 --> 02:08:36.240
told him this,
I confessed that when I left this audition,

2047
02:08:36.300 --> 02:08:39.000
this one that clearly was not what he was looking for,

2048
02:08:39.420 --> 02:08:41.940
that I call my agent and I was like a knock that shit out of him.

2049
02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:48.380
<v 3>That was hilarious.
I was like,
oh,
would be amazed if he does it.</v>

2050
02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:55.370
And then he called me,
he was like,
he,
he said,
I remember.
He goes,
he,

2051
02:08:55.550 --> 02:08:59.600
he didn't say it was,
it was perfect.
He said,

2052
02:09:00.710 --> 02:09:05.630
you know,
that you could,
uh,
maybe an improve it.
Like he was so delicate.

2053
02:09:05.631 --> 02:09:10.280
I was like [inaudible] saying,
he said,
could he call you?
And I was like,
yeah,

2054
02:09:10.281 --> 02:09:14.810
you can call me.
You know what's interesting now that you say that.
Okay,

2055
02:09:14.811 --> 02:09:18.670
how come it's the auditions?
You think you've nailed it and you're like,
I am.

2056
02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:20.840
But it's always,
you never get the call.

2057
02:09:21.020 --> 02:09:24.320
And no times that I've always gone in there and been like,
I don't give a fuck.

2058
02:09:24.350 --> 02:09:25.970
I actually went in one time,

2059
02:09:25.971 --> 02:09:30.230
I auditioned for a commercial and I did not give a fuck so bad that I was eating

2060
02:09:30.290 --> 02:09:32.450
their snacks,
like the casting people.

2061
02:09:32.460 --> 02:09:35.540
I was going to eat their pretzels and they're like,
do you want to do this?

2062
02:09:35.541 --> 02:09:38.150
And I was like,
Oh yeah,
sorry.
Bye.
Buh Buh.
And I booked it.

2063
02:09:38.151 --> 02:09:42.140
It was a national commercial.
I made a ton of money and I never,

2064
02:09:42.860 --> 02:09:44.520
I didn't even think I'd get it.
That's

2065
02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:48.270
<v 14>the,
and that,
that's kind of a huge secret to life right there.
And they actually,</v>

2066
02:09:48.271 --> 02:09:51.050
for John and I,
it's been the same way on the writing.
The writer,

2067
02:09:51.051 --> 02:09:55.170
his version of that is pitching.
Pitching is ridiculous.

2068
02:09:55.230 --> 02:09:58.890
It is a nightmare because it's like an audition that goes on for a half an hour.

2069
02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:00.720
It's,
it's brutal.
And Yeah,

2070
02:10:00.750 --> 02:10:03.750
cause you have to go in there and you have to tell them the entire movie,

2071
02:10:03.751 --> 02:10:06.480
but you can't tell him the entire movie because I mean,

2072
02:10:06.481 --> 02:10:09.150
if I sat down and told you the entire movie of Star Wars,

2073
02:10:09.151 --> 02:10:13.780
you'd be bored to tears in 10 minutes,
you know?
So Boba Fett guy.
Yeah,

2074
02:10:15.140 --> 02:10:19.830
exactly.
Yeah,
yeah.
So you have to find some way to make your story interesting,

2075
02:10:19.890 --> 02:10:21.210
not just as a movie,

2076
02:10:21.211 --> 02:10:25.500
but as of you telling it in the room and you have to bring energy to it.

2077
02:10:25.501 --> 02:10:27.120
Because if you just go in and go,
look guys,

2078
02:10:27.121 --> 02:10:29.310
it just goes like this and this and this and that.
I mean,
sure,

2079
02:10:29.311 --> 02:10:31.950
if you're a superstar or they'll go,
great,
well buy anything you have.

2080
02:10:31.951 --> 02:10:35.330
But when you're out there trying to make your bones,
it's,

2081
02:10:35.720 --> 02:10:38.360
you got to go in there and you got to put your back into it and you've got to

2082
02:10:38.361 --> 02:10:42.110
sell.
And I do not like selling.
I've never,
my brother is a salesman.

2083
02:10:42.120 --> 02:10:46.200
I could never do it.
So I just go in there and it's exhausting.
And,

2084
02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:47.810
but like you're saying,

2085
02:10:48.050 --> 02:10:51.590
there were times where John and I would go in on something and you know,

2086
02:10:51.591 --> 02:10:55.490
like a rewrite job or something and we'd be like,
Eh,
you know,
we,
we,

2087
02:10:55.640 --> 02:10:58.040
we talk about it and we'd kind of go in and we didn't give a shit.
You know,

2088
02:10:58.041 --> 02:11:02.960
we'd go in and we'd be like,
well,
I dunno,
I wouldn't do it like that.
I mean,

2089
02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:06.290
I would do it more like this.
I Dunno,
you know?
And they'd be like,
great,

2090
02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:09.820
you're hired.
But anytime we were just like so desperate to get the job,

2091
02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:14.640
it would just be like,
get everything relaxed,

2092
02:11:15.430 --> 02:11:18.520
see your essence,
and I can see who you are.
It's the dating.

2093
02:11:19.960 --> 02:11:24.950
If you're like,
I love you,
but after you're like,
uh,
I mean,
whatever,

2094
02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:27.350
I'm not that interested.
Then the person's like,
oh,

2095
02:11:27.351 --> 02:11:29.520
I'd love to go out with you always like that.

2096
02:11:29.650 --> 02:11:33.890
It's not about not caring because that's also I think really unappealing to

2097
02:11:33.891 --> 02:11:37.070
people acting like you don't give a shit about anything.
It's about,

2098
02:11:37.250 --> 02:11:42.250
it's about being confident in whatever choices you're making at the time and,

2099
02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:46.640
and more than anything,
being confident that if you don't,

2100
02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:49.580
if this thing you're doing right now isn't successful,

2101
02:11:49.581 --> 02:11:52.550
that you're going to go on survivor.
There's zero.

2102
02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:54.740
It has to have an in all facets,

2103
02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:59.030
no desperation because people can read when you're desperate for work or love or

2104
02:11:59.031 --> 02:11:59.680
anything like that.

2105
02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:03.110
And I think the reason why that that happens like that naturally is because if

2106
02:12:03.111 --> 02:12:05.990
you are desperate,
you're not going to do a very good job of it.
Right.

2107
02:12:06.110 --> 02:12:09.920
So I think people can read that and I think it's valuable that if somebody is

2108
02:12:09.921 --> 02:12:13.580
just so desperate to whatever it is that they're doing it,

2109
02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:15.060
it's probably not going to work out very well.
Yeah,

2110
02:12:15.380 --> 02:12:16.910
I was gonna say they needed too much.

2111
02:12:16.911 --> 02:12:20.420
This experience also like just for other actors.

2112
02:12:20.421 --> 02:12:25.310
I would say it showcased to me the nearly,
I won't say totally,

2113
02:12:25.311 --> 02:12:30.311
but like the near almost nearly impossible task of getting cast in a feature

2114
02:12:32.900 --> 02:12:37.550
studio film without previous experience.
It really is a hurdle,

2115
02:12:37.820 --> 02:12:39.680
right?
Like you,
you really need allies.

2116
02:12:39.681 --> 02:12:44.681
Like I had you wanting me to be in this and it's like it's still,

2117
02:12:45.110 --> 02:12:49.150
you start,
you know,
you start seeing how movies are cat cause you know,

2118
02:12:49.190 --> 02:12:51.920
you realize that studios go like,

2119
02:12:51.921 --> 02:12:54.380
well who has done this before?

2120
02:12:54.380 --> 02:12:56.930
Who has a track record like this?

2121
02:12:56.931 --> 02:12:59.390
Sometimes it's that because in your case,

2122
02:13:00.140 --> 02:13:04.850
I don't think anybody at the studio quite had an idea of what you're following

2123
02:13:04.851 --> 02:13:07.340
was.
I didn't either to be honest.
I had seen your,

2124
02:13:07.341 --> 02:13:11.330
your specials on Netflix and I just thought they were brilliant.
Um,

2125
02:13:11.810 --> 02:13:15.270
I think what it is more than anything is that through your stand up,

2126
02:13:15.290 --> 02:13:18.440
you were cultivating,
you were digging down,

2127
02:13:18.441 --> 02:13:22.010
drilling into your personality and different aspects of your personality.

2128
02:13:22.490 --> 02:13:26.780
And in this business you have so many people that have been doing Shakespeare

2129
02:13:26.781 --> 02:13:31.781
from the time that they were young and they are good at being actors,

2130
02:13:31.801 --> 02:13:35.640
but they,
they sometimes can lose track of who they are as people.

2131
02:13:35.940 --> 02:13:38.520
And that's what you're looking for more than anything you're looking for.

2132
02:13:38.521 --> 02:13:43.200
Who's behind those eyes that can bring something to this part beyond just,

2133
02:13:43.201 --> 02:13:47.010
there's a lot of people that can deliver the dialogue and make it sound

2134
02:13:47.011 --> 02:13:51.960
reasonably,
you know,
believable.
But it is hard,
right,
to get cast.

2135
02:13:51.990 --> 02:13:53.640
I mean,
oh no,
it's,
it's very hard.

2136
02:13:53.641 --> 02:13:58.230
But what I'm saying is that it's not so much about knowing that somebody has

2137
02:13:58.231 --> 02:14:00.570
experienced or whatever,
it's,
it's the,

2138
02:14:00.571 --> 02:14:04.320
somebody coming in and bringing some humanity into whatever it is that they're

2139
02:14:04.321 --> 02:14:06.900
doing and that's what the experience allows people to do.

2140
02:14:06.901 --> 02:14:09.750
I think particularly with Standup,
I think the reason why,
you know,

2141
02:14:09.780 --> 02:14:12.330
like Chris rock is a really good actor.
I mean,

2142
02:14:12.331 --> 02:14:17.010
so many standups are really good actors.
Adam Sandler is an amazing actor,

2143
02:14:17.011 --> 02:14:17.670
you know,

2144
02:14:17.670 --> 02:14:20.450
and I think it's because you've got to go out there on stage and just sort of

2145
02:14:20.451 --> 02:14:23.690
like put yourself out there over and over again.
Sure.

2146
02:14:23.730 --> 02:14:25.200
In front of so many different people.

2147
02:14:25.380 --> 02:14:27.980
You're going to drill down into who you really are.
Yeah.

2148
02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:28.801
I can do to be good at it.

2149
02:14:28.801 --> 02:14:31.960
And I think about a lot of time because if you're fake on stage,
everybody,
yeah,

2150
02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:34.170
<v 3>no,
no,
I know.
And that's why you people bomb.</v>

2151
02:14:34.440 --> 02:14:39.030
It's because the audience can smell the inauthenticity or if you're terrified

2152
02:14:39.031 --> 02:14:41.520
like that,
that comic you were talking about feeling uncomfortable,

2153
02:14:41.880 --> 02:14:43.260
it may have been his terror that

2154
02:14:43.450 --> 02:14:46.490
<v 14>they're like,
it's like an animal thing right away.
They're like dogs,</v>

2155
02:14:47.270 --> 02:14:49.380
but doesn't everybody have to start a start there?

2156
02:14:49.740 --> 02:14:53.750
Do y'all have the experience fuck up for years and bombing and like horrible,

2157
02:14:54.050 --> 02:14:54.850
horrible.

2158
02:14:54.850 --> 02:14:59.090
They're emotionally traumatizing experiences big about like comedians and their

2159
02:14:59.091 --> 02:15:03.260
humanity.
I always think about a Robin Williams.
Oh my God.
Because,
um,
you know,

2160
02:15:03.261 --> 02:15:04.220
it was like,
I was like,
man,

2161
02:15:04.221 --> 02:15:09.221
like he really that read so much whenever he was on screen.

2162
02:15:09.580 --> 02:15:13.790
Yeah.
Um,
just like the human being that was there,
you know,
that like,
oh yeah,

2163
02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:16.300
you really connected with it.
Like I would see him and you know,

2164
02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:17.840
he played countless roles,

2165
02:15:17.841 --> 02:15:21.440
but like in especially like in a drama or something or even when he was in a

2166
02:15:21.441 --> 02:15:25.700
comedy during like the dramatic scenes that balanced the movie out,
man,

2167
02:15:25.701 --> 02:15:30.680
you always felt like,
wow,
I really am.
See the person here.
Yeah.

2168
02:15:30.681 --> 02:15:33.910
You know?
Yeah.
When he wasn't being funny and,
and to,

2169
02:15:33.980 --> 02:15:38.980
and I don't think it's any coincidence that so many standups who you just think

2170
02:15:40.341 --> 02:15:44.000
of,
oh,
that that guy or that woman is really good on stage,

2171
02:15:44.001 --> 02:15:47.150
that it's no coincidence that they are effortlessly be able to,

2172
02:15:47.540 --> 02:15:50.660
or they're able to turn in these,
these roles.
I mean,
Sarah Silverman,

2173
02:15:50.690 --> 02:15:55.010
so many people that have done these incredible roles in movies that you know

2174
02:15:55.011 --> 02:15:55.844
that if,

2175
02:15:55.880 --> 02:15:58.520
if you're one of those people that started acting lessons when you were four

2176
02:15:58.521 --> 02:15:59.870
years old,
it must be,

2177
02:16:00.260 --> 02:16:03.380
it must drive you a little crazy to see somebody who's been telling jokes and

2178
02:16:03.381 --> 02:16:06.440
bars for 10 years,
come,
come in and just crush like that.

2179
02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:10.280
But I think the reason why is because they're also doing this something really

2180
02:16:10.281 --> 02:16:11.930
similar to what you're doing when you're,

2181
02:16:12.770 --> 02:16:15.260
when you're pursuing acting at that level,

2182
02:16:15.350 --> 02:16:16.940
you're just drilling down into who you are.

2183
02:16:17.090 --> 02:16:18.980
<v 3>Yeah,
and I also think too,</v>

2184
02:16:19.250 --> 02:16:23.390
I think what's great about being a comic is that there's a level,

2185
02:16:23.391 --> 02:16:27.440
like you can be successful,
but then you can also eat shit every week.

2186
02:16:27.441 --> 02:16:30.280
Like you're never too on your own koolaid

2187
02:16:30.490 --> 02:16:35.110
<v 0>check.
You can check it all,
but like your ego,</v>

2188
02:16:35.111 --> 02:16:38.110
there's not a lot of bullshit.
Well,
after a while too,

2189
02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:42.700
you learn to not listen to that,
which is a really funny thing.
Like,

2190
02:16:42.701 --> 02:16:47.140
in other words,
you'll be on such a good streak of like great shows,

2191
02:16:47.440 --> 02:16:50.890
but you won't buy into,
Oh,
I'm amazing.

2192
02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:54.430
Because you'll know that it's not true.

2193
02:16:54.490 --> 02:16:59.100
You'll know like keep your self grounded.
Right.

2194
02:16:59.140 --> 02:17:03.850
Because this shit can go sideways quickly so you don't,

2195
02:17:03.880 --> 02:17:08.230
you actually don't buy into getting lost in all my shows go well

2196
02:17:08.750 --> 02:17:13.750
<v 14>you've seen people before you who have risen and risen and risen and then</v>

2197
02:17:13.931 --> 02:17:16.300
started to fall off for whatever reason.

2198
02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:21.340
People had kind of gotten used to what they were doing and they,

2199
02:17:21.370 --> 02:17:23.740
you know,
so,
so you never know.
I mean,

2200
02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:27.340
the way I look at it for me is that when did you look at anybody's imdv page?

2201
02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:30.460
It stopped somewhere.
Yeah.
There aren't that many people,

2202
02:17:30.580 --> 02:17:33.540
particularly directors or writers where it just goes on and on and on and

2203
02:17:33.541 --> 02:17:36.910
usually it's sort of,
it just stopped somewhere.
So you,
hey,

2204
02:17:36.911 --> 02:17:39.640
you want to be grateful for whatever time you have and be,

2205
02:17:39.641 --> 02:17:42.490
you want to always keep that in the back of your mind that this isn't a gravy

2206
02:17:42.491 --> 02:17:44.410
train that just goes on.

2207
02:17:44.540 --> 02:17:46.910
<v 0>What do you tell yourself?
Like you just go,
like,
we'll just keep working,</v>

2208
02:17:46.911 --> 02:17:47.744
keep doing the work.

2209
02:17:47.990 --> 02:17:50.120
<v 14>Yeah.
I mean,
John and I,</v>

2210
02:17:50.150 --> 02:17:54.860
we've always seen ourselves as pretty blue collar and that way we know we're not

2211
02:17:54.861 --> 02:17:55.694
geniuses.

2212
02:17:56.180 --> 02:18:01.180
We know that we work for a living and we get together every day and we sit in a

2213
02:18:01.791 --> 02:18:06.791
room and we talk about nonsense and we just just keep poking and prodding at it

2214
02:18:06.801 --> 02:18:08.630
until it comes together in some way.

2215
02:18:08.631 --> 02:18:12.980
And we try not to ever turn in drafts that don't hold up,
you know?

2216
02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:17.570
And uh,
but,
but everything that we're doing is so subjective.

2217
02:18:17.810 --> 02:18:22.810
You can write a scene that you think is the greatest scene ever written and

2218
02:18:23.061 --> 02:18:25.610
there's going to be somebody that's going to go,
ah,
it's a piece of shit.
Yeah.

2219
02:18:26.030 --> 02:18:29.480
Kind of an asshole would read that.
Yeah.
So,
so there's no way you can ever,

2220
02:18:29.510 --> 02:18:33.710
you can say you can't write for them though,
but you,
but you can't.

2221
02:18:34.310 --> 02:18:35.330
It's like what you're saying,

2222
02:18:35.331 --> 02:18:39.950
you can't ever think that you've got it all figured out because you just never

2223
02:18:39.951 --> 02:18:41.060
will,
you know,

2224
02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:45.800
<v 0>so you just keep doing the work.
Listen,</v>

2225
02:18:45.890 --> 02:18:48.050
I,
uh,
I had such a good experience with you.

2226
02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:51.980
I want to thank you again for the opportunity.
Thank you.
Awesome.

2227
02:18:51.981 --> 02:18:56.360
I feel like I won a contest.
I think I did.
And um,
we,
uh,

2228
02:18:56.390 --> 02:18:59.030
we've had fun with you here.
I want to encourage everybody.

2229
02:18:59.031 --> 02:19:02.270
I know I got a ton of messages this week,
man,
from people that were like,

2230
02:19:02.420 --> 02:19:05.690
I'm going the movie just to see you like tea to me.
And they're like,

2231
02:19:05.691 --> 02:19:09.590
I ended up loving the movie.
I was not expecting this.
I wasn't expecting to cry.

2232
02:19:09.740 --> 02:19:14.720
Fuck you,
you piece of Shit and go to a movie where I cried.
Stuff like that.
Um,

2233
02:19:14.750 --> 02:19:18.410
but I think you made an amazing film and I'm happy to be a part of it and it's

2234
02:19:18.650 --> 02:19:22.700
Thanksgiving week and I want to encourage everybody to go see it and bring

2235
02:19:22.701 --> 02:19:24.170
people a,
it's an awesome movie.

2236
02:19:24.310 --> 02:19:27.380
<v 14>Yeah,
thanks.
And by the way,
thank you for being in the movie.
I mean you,</v>

2237
02:19:27.410 --> 02:19:28.310
you brought a ton

2238
02:19:28.310 --> 02:19:29.143
<v 19>to it.</v>

2239
02:19:29.180 --> 02:19:32.960
And even just having you on set with that attitude of being so excited to be

2240
02:19:32.961 --> 02:19:37.820
there at,
I mean,
that's really valuable to me.
It relates to being in movies.

2241
02:19:37.930 --> 02:19:42.410
I know keep people who this thing and they get used to it.
I mean,

2242
02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:43.720
I gotta admit I'm,

2243
02:19:43.850 --> 02:19:47.900
I'm a little bit too used to being on set and sometimes that's what's great

2244
02:19:47.901 --> 02:19:51.050
about having somebody who comes in who's not there all the time,

2245
02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:54.060
is that it's a good reminder of like,
Oh yeah,
we get to make them.

2246
02:19:54.640 --> 02:19:56.930
I was little is that I was like,
God,

2247
02:19:56.940 --> 02:20:01.750
I stand here and watch the monitors and then were like,
yeah,
I like,

2248
02:20:01.880 --> 02:20:06.530
I was like somebody visiting set and there's free food everywhere.
It was great.

2249
02:20:06.531 --> 02:20:09.800
And that's like the fucking crazy.
I mean you,
you met half of them have the,

2250
02:20:09.900 --> 02:20:14.240
of using actors,
Haggerty so much.
She's so great.

2251
02:20:14.300 --> 02:20:18.310
And our,
our grandma,
Grandma Sandy,
Marco,
Marco.

2252
02:20:18.720 --> 02:20:23.030
And I love her because she's,
my younger sister was like,

2253
02:20:23.031 --> 02:20:26.420
I'm so proud of you.
It was awesome.
I love it.
And I got thanks.
She goes,

2254
02:20:26.421 --> 02:20:30.710
I thought Grandmas,
Sandy was the best.
Okay.

2255
02:20:32.300 --> 02:20:37.080
No,
she's so great.
I feel like,
I feel like one thing I could do,
um,

2256
02:20:37.220 --> 02:20:41.660
that I could borrow from Trump is the,
uh,
is the way he,
uh,

2257
02:20:41.810 --> 02:20:45.260
he has this like self promoting thing that he does really well,

2258
02:20:45.290 --> 02:20:48.410
but I think an actor could do,
which is,
um,
he'll be like,

2259
02:20:48.411 --> 02:20:52.700
a lot of people are saying this and so I'm going to just start going.

2260
02:20:53.060 --> 02:20:56.660
A lot of people are saying it's the performance of a lifetime.
Yeah.

2261
02:20:57.170 --> 02:21:00.440
Or he'll be here in that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He'll be like,
I keep,
I'm talking to,

2262
02:21:01.070 --> 02:21:03.410
and they're just saying that,
you know,
that they've never seen,

2263
02:21:03.420 --> 02:21:08.420
but everybody's saying everybody or a is incredible when you hear about the

2264
02:21:09.231 --> 02:21:13.490
tears,
you know,
that it's there pretty much all coming from him.
A lot of people,

2265
02:21:14.030 --> 02:21:17.330
a lot of people are even saying that they're crying because I'm not in certain

2266
02:21:17.331 --> 02:21:19.490
seats.
That's another thing I've heard people say.

2267
02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:23.390
A lot of people I love too that you get that one extra laugh in the,

2268
02:21:23.391 --> 02:21:27.700
in the last scene when you're with,
with,
uh,
John Morris is oh yeah,
yeah.
That,

2269
02:21:27.701 --> 02:21:30.890
that,
that,
that always gets,
uh,
gets,
uh,
the head of the movie.

2270
02:21:30.920 --> 02:21:34.340
I think people cause,
cause,
and I think the reason why that gets a good laugh,

2271
02:21:34.620 --> 02:21:36.230
you know,
nobody knows what I'm talking about right now.

2272
02:21:36.231 --> 02:21:39.170
But I think the reason why that gets a good laugh is because people really want

2273
02:21:39.171 --> 02:21:44.060
Russ to,
to make this work.
You know,
they like Russ,
they want them to,

2274
02:21:44.450 --> 02:21:48.290
there's so many great characters and multiple storylines with like with the

2275
02:21:48.291 --> 02:21:51.950
whole family,
you know,
are different people in that one.
Yeah.
That's a fun,

2276
02:21:51.980 --> 02:21:56.630
I'm glad that made the cut.
Yeah,
we were that day.
Um,
all right,
well,

2277
02:21:56.810 --> 02:22:01.430

2281
02:22:10.910 --> 02:22:13.750

2282
