We sure do.
But usually I plan on being there.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.220

I like it already.
We start to show them in.
Yeah.

51
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.210
Fuck boys out there.
Just trying to talk shit against me.
Oh,
okay.

52
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.370
Oh,
I see you have a gun.
Do you?
You have a gun deal.

53
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.660
I'll put down my weapon out,
down to my weapon.

54
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.280
I will put down my weapon.
I got another fucking sword,

55
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.913
bitch.

56
00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.080
<v 0>Well,
well,
well go to your mom's house,</v>

57
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.173
Christina.

58
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.430
My audience moving then man.

59
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.113
Horrible

60
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.903
does that.

61
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:47.471
<v 1>It's really cool.</v>

62
00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:50.950
I was reading that first ad and you were searching for your email.
You're like,

63
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.910
<v 3>oh,
sorry.
So that first ad has you just it,</v>

64
00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.340
you know,
because 5,000 different people send us the copy,
right?

65
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.560
I don't know who the fuck to look for.
Hey,
take it easy.

66
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.820
This isn't this so demeaning.
Look at this like a goat.

67
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.430
You are a goat.
That's why they call you goat lips.

68
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.980
You have trouble finding the fucking ads.
Why don't you just,
linkedin is helpful.

69
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.340
There's Linkedin and get all the ads there.
Length.
Dennis,

70
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.010
how length is how Dennis helpful?

71
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.830
Nobody actually uses link.

72
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:29.540
I feel like linkedin only exist to be invited to use it and then nobody really

73
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:33.550
uses it once the loud you to their linkedin profile.

74
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.480
I always wanting to add but never really using no thanks.

75
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.730
Don't want anything to do with you.
Um,
linkedin.

76
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.220
What a great first of all.
Yeah,
I like it.
Cool.

77
00:06:45.221 --> 00:06:50.200
Your first boyfriend has a video app and again,
it kind of reminds me of him.

78
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.210
Um,
no,
but,
uh,
this dude,
he's not playing games while you fuck boys.

79
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.920
I think fuck boy is one of my favorite saying like,
fuck boy,
what does it mean?

80
00:06:59.921 --> 00:07:03.370
Is it is,
it's,
it's a,
it's a demeaning.

81
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.420
You're a bitch of a bitch of a man.
You're not even a man.
You're a fuckboy fuck.

82
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.770
It's a huge insult.
Have you heard?
Fuck boy.
Yeah.
It's,
no,
it's no good man.

83
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.200
I like it.
It's kind of,
you know,
where it came from.

84
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.110
I think it came out of the fact that,
uh,
it's,

85
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.900
it's socially unacceptable to basically say faggot.
Right?
Oh,

86
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:28.250
okay.
It's like an anger at fuck is,
is,
is,

87
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.780
is pejorative.
It's full of venom.
And it's,

88
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.950
I think it's like almost like a replacement for that,
so instead of fag,

89
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.910
you're not saying,
fuck boy.
Yeah.
It's,
it's meant to be really insulting.
Right.

90
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:45.220
And I think it's something that people can yell,
right.
Without being like,
Hey,

91
00:07:45.221 --> 00:07:49.150
what watches off c version of Faggot?
I think so.
Yeah.

92
00:07:49.151 --> 00:07:52.520
I really feel like the it is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,
I like,
fuck boy.

93
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.860
If I can't say Faggot,
I'm going to say fuck boy.

94
00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:58.720
It sounds like you're already doing it.
Sounds like it worked.

95
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.230
I think I like this new system.
Yeah.

96
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.910
About this is how you get around the political,
correct.
It is.

97
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.980
You just find a new word for the same thing.
That's exactly what's happening.

98
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.360
Yeah.
I'm on board looking for that new end bomb.
If you know anyone,

99
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:11.410
any suggestion,

100
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.770
but you fuck boys out there trying to talk shit against me.

101
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:21.620
Oh.
Oh.
I like how slowly he puts it away.
You have a gun deal.

102
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.210
I'll put down my weapon out down my west.
Okay.

103
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:31.520
I will send down my weapon.
I got another fucking sword.

104
00:08:31.521 --> 00:08:32.960
You fucking bitch.

105
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:39.720
Yeah,
I love him.
Yeah.
He's talking that shit.

106
00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.530
This guy could have very well dated.
You definitely could have dated that guy.

107
00:08:43.531 --> 00:08:48.340
Yeah.
He reminds me and Christian Slater a little bit from the 90s.
Ah,

108
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.630
yeah.
I don't know something about him.
It's fucking funny,
man.

109
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.220
I would ask what's going on there,
but it's like,
why bother at this point?
Yeah.

110
00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.360
Yeah.
Why,
why even ask?
I used to care and now I'm like,
you know what,

111
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.960
it's just worlds.
Just the world.

112
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.830
The world sees what happens when you do 338 episodes.

113
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:06.620
<v 1>My Mom's house,</v>

114
00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.250
<v 3>I don't even know where to start with a this going on</v>

115
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.990
<v 1>this weekend.
Um,
or with this,
this show,
there's so many things to talk about.</v>

116
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.390
Um,
you know,

117
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.580
one of the great things that happened was this weekend.

118
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:29.750
Oh God.
Are we going to talk about this already?
The only we should,

119
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.550
I think it's pretty good idea.
Oh Jesus.
Fuck.
Here's your boy.

120
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.910
<v 3>Can I,
thanks for coming out to flappers guys.
What a fun weekend.</v>

121
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.903
<v 4>Bourbon.</v>

122
00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.770
<v 3>That's your boy.
Dj Dad Mouth.
I saw,
so did you make the horn sounds,</v>

123
00:09:56.771 --> 00:09:59.920
was that you actually DJ?
Yes.
Yeah.
And then you went and then I screwed up.

124
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.690
He did it kind of,
you know,
like,
this is my first time.
Yeah.
Yeah,
for sure.
It was,

125
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.880
<v 1>how'd it feel?
It felt amazing.
I've never had so much joy.</v>

126
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.540
I even texted you a picture of myself smiling ear to ear saying,

127
00:10:12.541 --> 00:10:14.700
I can't sleep because I'm just thinking about my deejaying career.

128
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.800
Cause I canceled all the rest of my standup dates for the year.
Um,

129
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:23.210
so here's what happened.
I'm in,
uh,
I'm in,
uh,
Cleveland all yeah.

130
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.840
Doing shows.
And I see on Twitter,
somebody tags me a tweet.
Oh,

131
00:10:27.841 --> 00:10:31.410
so cool that,
uh,
Tom Segura and Hannibal Burress,

132
00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:32.730
or in Cleveland at the same time,

133
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.960
if I look at Hannibal's page and he's doing a popup show,
we're like,
oh,

134
00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:38.040
I have two shows tonight.

135
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:42.150
Maybe I can get him to come over on the early show.

136
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:47.400
So I send him a text.
I said,
are you,
are you in town?
Do you want to come in,

137
00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:52.310
pop and do a guest spot on my early show?
And he says,
sure.
So he comes by the,

138
00:10:52.311 --> 00:10:56.910
the club and he has his DJ.
Uh,
he does,

139
00:10:56.911 --> 00:11:01.020
he has a DJ that he brings to all his shows.
Right.
Tony Trimm,

140
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.460
who's a great guy and I just met that night.
I love Hannibal,
by the way.

141
00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.190
I haven't seen him in a minute,
but I really like that and it was great.

142
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.340
So first of all,
uh,

143
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:14.970
I have a video of him hitting the stage.
The djs name Tony Trim.

144
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.860
<v 3>Tony Trimm.
Yeah.
Deejays.
Why do all Djs have like the coolest personality?</v>

145
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.760
He's the coolest guy.
I know.
They all are.
Yeah.

146
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.120
You may want to hang out with him for sure.

147
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.800
[inaudible] Jay scratch starting from scratch.
Yeah.
Hung out with that guy in,

148
00:11:26.801 --> 00:11:30.410
in London and spend bad,
there are the fucking coolest dudes because we,

149
00:11:30.411 --> 00:11:33.580
what they like,
you know,
they love music,
so yeah.
I mean they love it.

150
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:35.460
They like having a good time.
They're DJ's.
Yeah.

151
00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:37.680
And they're kind of down to earth cause I feel like deejaying,

152
00:11:37.681 --> 00:11:40.810
it's a real humble gig in the beginning.
Much like stand up,

153
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.310
which is why they usually,
you click with them.
Yeah.

154
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.850
It's the same grass roots effort.
Like,
does anyone want to hear me Dj?
Yeah,

155
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.460
fuck you asshole.
And it takes 10 years,
like really getting good.

156
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:54.340
I love your scratch.
Yeah.
That's really

157
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:58.870
<v 5>key.
Is graduate to have a big record.
Make her use two hands.</v>

158
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.560
<v 1>So anyways,</v>

159
00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:06.510
I these guys both see me getting really excited.
Oh No,
no,
I'm jumping ahead.
Yeah.

160
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.090
Handled,
does a guest spot.
I have a video of him hitting the stage,

161
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:13.740
that place he rubbed it.
I mean it was like you announced,

162
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:16.250
guess what George Carlin isn't dead.
He's right here.

163
00:12:16.251 --> 00:12:20.230
Like they went fucking crazy,
which was cool to watch.
Yeah.
Uh,

164
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.240
and then he set the tone.
It was great.
Um,

165
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.930
and also I should say bill squire was on the shows,

166
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.870
the full charge coming back to the west coast.

167
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:32.370
Got then did me a favor doing those shows.
So it was great.

168
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.020
So anyways,
then panels like I'm going to do my show on the other side of town,

169
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.730
other side of town,
meaning 600 miles away.
And he says,
uh,

170
00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:44.930
if you want afterwards,
ah,
I'm having,

171
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.670
I'm throwing an after party and this is what he does this in a lot of cities

172
00:12:47.671 --> 00:12:52.671
like finds a place after his show and has a party and you know,

173
00:12:53.311 --> 00:12:57.030
obviously Dj is Dj doesn't just do his live show.
He does the after party.

174
00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.440
You want to come?
I go,
sure.
And then he texts me,
I'll let you DJ a few songs.

175
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:05.080
Oh my God.
Did your Dick just explode off your I was like,

176
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.820
I started texting him love letters.
I was like,
dude,
this is a map.

177
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:12.280
<v 5>No Ha.
Sorry.
How to handle all know that you were interested in Dj.
He just knows,</v>

178
00:13:12.281 --> 00:13:15.210
I mean we've,
we've talked about music before but then he saw,

179
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:18.550
I mean right there I was like asking the Dj all about equipment.

180
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.820
So he was watching,
he was watching us.
Yeah.
And May I say for the record,

181
00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:25.830
Hannibal Buress is a type of gentlemen who should have yes.
Yes.

182
00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:30.040
A Dj,
Huh?
Opening friendly.
He's a cool,
it's cool dude.
Yeah.

183
00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:33.640
Like it's a mellow dude.
I can see him being like,
I love it.
This is part of his,

184
00:13:33.641 --> 00:13:34.750
his steeze,
you know,

185
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:38.230
<v 1>talking about it.
How,
when,
when Tony is not available.
I was like,</v>

186
00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.270
is that the worst?
He's like,
yeah,
absolutely.

187
00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:44.080
Because I liked the vibe that it says it's your show and you know,
then I,

188
00:13:44.081 --> 00:13:46.120
then I'm asking you a sound guy.
Can you do this?

189
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.800
<v 5>What?
Yeah.
It's like,
it's the most impossible request.
Well,</v>

190
00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:53.220
like this weekend at full pairs,
I did my shows and they're great.

191
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.150
Thank you for asking.
And I requested a song.
How were you?

192
00:13:56.151 --> 00:14:01.110
Shows that they were amazing.
Yeah.
So Super Fun.
You had,
um,

193
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:05.910
I old Maryland rice cub of who?
I love Dave Ryan.
It's my homie.
Yeah.

194
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.430
Anyways,
I asked the,
you know,
the Dj,

195
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:12.570
can you just bring me up to like John Spencer Blues Explosion?
Who,
okay.

196
00:14:12.571 --> 00:14:14.790
The song is called two kinds of law.
What's that?

197
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.750
And then how far in should I start?
I'm like,
dude,
just fucking make it good.
Yeah,

198
00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:23.100
you're the DJ.
Yeah,
you fucking,
I,
you should know these things and you know what?

199
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:27.300
That's your fuck one job.
Could I hired this guy,
right,
right.
Dj Dan,

200
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:29.640
Marketo burned me out of whatever.
Just fucking

201
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:46.590
can I compliment you on your,
like you got down.
What djs do,

202
00:14:46.591 --> 00:14:50.160
like the pointing and the course,
you know it's all coming together.
It's still,

203
00:14:50.161 --> 00:14:52.060
that looks fucking Funkmaster

204
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.830
<v 1>flex right there.
You do look like you.
You could be a DJ though.</v>

205
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:59.840
I'm going to be a DJ.
No,
I am going to Dj.
Yeah,

206
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.770
no,
no,
no.
I can,
I can hear the sarcasm response.

207
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.390
What's great about our garage is that it's really soundproofed let me finish.

208
00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:12.350
So this is the best news ever.
So why?

209
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.640
Then I get a message from him.
So he's like,
you know,
come,
come,
hang out.

210
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.160
And you're like,
okay,
I'm going to come.
I have two shows.

211
00:15:19.161 --> 00:15:22.850
I have a show that starts at,
you know,
nine 30 10 I'm going to get it.

212
00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:25.310
And you're like,
I'm going to go.
But you're,
it's still like,

213
00:15:25.311 --> 00:15:27.140
I got to get in a car and go across town.

214
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.380
I get offstage and handle was no,

215
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:34.070
we're going to do the after party at the club that you're at at the comedy club.

216
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.500
Oh even better.
So I like that's the,
you don't have to go anywhere,
you know,

217
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:41.450
the only thing better would be like,
it's in your hotel.
So,

218
00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.630
so he shows up with Tony,
they,
you know,

219
00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.310
they set up in the lounge,
people are hanging out having drinks,

220
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:56.480
he sets up and then I go up there and I go,
can I get like a little tutorial?

221
00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:01.340
They,
they each are showing me stuff with Tony is like giving me kind of a crash

222
00:16:01.341 --> 00:16:04.400
course and you know,
he's like,
oh,
you're not intimidated by buttons.
When I go,

223
00:16:04.401 --> 00:16:08.630
I think I actually doing this show,
I go,
you know,
I'm always playing drops,

224
00:16:08.631 --> 00:16:12.900
adjusting things.
And is this similar to what it's not.
I mean,

225
00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.010
it's not on board.
They have a board there that,
you know,

226
00:16:16.011 --> 00:16:20.570
I think he was plugged into,
it's just that the,
his actual,
it's,

227
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:25.220
you know,
two basically two turntables and a microphone.
Yeah.
At a mixer.
It's all,

228
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:28.640
he has an all in one board.
It's just that remembering,
oh,

229
00:16:28.641 --> 00:16:32.720
this does this and that does that.
I can memorize that and not be like,

230
00:16:32.721 --> 00:16:35.300
what is all this right away?
I don't know what I'm doing,

231
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:40.280
but I'm saying electronic devices that have different functions don't make me

232
00:16:40.281 --> 00:16:43.490
go,
I'm not doing anything with that.
It's not as daunting.
It's not as daunting.

233
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:48.260
So I'm starting to learn the thing,
you know,
the very basics.

234
00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:53.540
Um,
I'm starting to,
I have him take a picture and video.

235
00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:57.770
I sent it to you and then we're laughing so hard at your responses because your

236
00:16:57.771 --> 00:17:02.360
responses are like,
no,
you should be embarrassed.

237
00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:07.010
This is embarrassing.
Like so,
so demeaning.

238
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:08.690
The,
so gay,

239
00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:14.740
fuck boy gay can't say,
yeah,
you're,

240
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:17.390
it's just like,
and then I keep telling him,
I'm like,

241
00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:20.510
I keep showing them the messages and I'm like,
I just enjoy this.
He was like,

242
00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:24.740
dude,
I'm going to give you free Skype lessons.
I'm going to get you in that.

243
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:30.770
Tony Trimm.
Thanks Tony for the free lessons via Skype.

244
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:37.760
What are you doing to my life?
Having fun?
We're having fun.
God dammit.

245
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.250
So anyways,

246
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:43.190
I had an absolute blast doing that.

247
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.800
I have ordered no,
yes,
I ordered the same equipment he has.

248
00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:51.890
Okay,
great.
Um,
how much of an investment is that?

249
00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:54.160
It's under $15,000.
Okay.

250
00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.810
<v 3>Well,
sorry,
a little jeans.
You don't need diapers and dad's got a scratch board.</v>

251
00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:08.760
Your baby doesn't need a formula or closed dead scratch in this weekend.

252
00:18:09.061 --> 00:18:12.340
And Yeah,
Cleveland,
it's pretty good.
So no,

253
00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:16.810
it's absolutely not expensive actually.
You would,
you'd be surprised.
Yeah,

254
00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.500
seriously.
I don't need to know.
You don't need to know.
I need to fill me in.

255
00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.170
We don't need to talk about it that seriously.
It's funny.
This,
yeah,

256
00:18:23.171 --> 00:18:26.350
it's far less than the laptop.
Oh,
that's cool.
Yeah.
So it's not,

257
00:18:26.351 --> 00:18:29.860
it's not a crazy thing.
It's like buying a keyboard.
Sure.
Yeah.
You know why?

258
00:18:29.861 --> 00:18:34.400
Because it's one of those things where as time progressed and it,

259
00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:38.020
they made it easier for people to access things.
It drove the price of things.

260
00:18:38.021 --> 00:18:42.220
Why does everything,
Yeah.
Um,
now this may be a dumb question,

261
00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:46.490
but do the Djs use records anymore?
It's all you can there.

262
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.110
I mean you can as this is plugged in with a computer.
Wow.

263
00:18:50.111 --> 00:18:52.180
So you go to your iTunes.
Yeah.
And you're like,
yeah.

264
00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:55.540
So then how do they blend the two songs together?
How do you do that?

265
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.960
That's part of the,
there's a mixer in the board.

266
00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.970
I feel like I'm a thousand years and it has a built in horn drop.

267
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:10.060
As long as you do the horn,
drop my fine and also has gunshots.

268
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.200
Here's what I mean.

269
00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:18.250
<v 1>Really.
I'm not,
I'm,
I'm going to come out and say it right now.
Okay.
I feel like,</v>

270
00:19:18.251 --> 00:19:21.040
yes,
I'm going to put it,
it's going to be obviously in the garage.

271
00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.140
It's gonna be something I do recreationally for fun.

272
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:27.370
When I get to the point where I'm not like obviously going to be a professional

273
00:19:27.371 --> 00:19:30.080
DJ,
but when it gets to the point where I have a,
um,

274
00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.240
a decent command of how to,
you know,

275
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:40.120
get songs playing,
moving together,
like I have some command of,
of this board,

276
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.080
I am going to do a show somewhere.
I don't know what city will be.

277
00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:48.610
And then I'm going to have an after party where I'm going to bring that shit and

278
00:19:48.611 --> 00:19:49.444
we're going to

279
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:53.520
<v 3>all right.
A live party.
I think you should do it.
Dj,
Dad,
Matthew J.</v>

280
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.790
Dad Mountain to Dj Dad math or is it typically by,

281
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:59.630
I feel like dad mouth is who I am.
Yeah.
I feel like,
uh,

282
00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:03.190
I feel like that's the right Dj name for me.
Yeah.

283
00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.000
Plus it's a huge shout out to your mom's house listeners,

284
00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:09.520
which let's face it will be your only audience in the beginning.

285
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:15.420
Maybe in the beginning.
Yeah.
Until you really build that a beef following.

286
00:20:15.421 --> 00:20:20.310
Are you going to be fun to spam?
Yeah.
Um,
am I am.

287
00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:24.840
I feel like that'll be on the,
you know,
on the leg of it.

288
00:20:24.841 --> 00:20:28.440
I feel like it'll be kind of like Spokane,
Syracuse.
He be fast.

289
00:20:28.441 --> 00:20:31.980
Something that was a huge Dj.
I know you have to go to Miami to like pay.
I got a,

290
00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:36.000
sorry,
I got a book,
a Miami Gig Asap.
Miami.
And then you've got to do Vegas.

291
00:20:36.001 --> 00:20:38.250
That's where all the Djs and you love Vegas.

292
00:20:38.251 --> 00:20:40.920
That's the cool thing is now you get to go to all your favorite cities.

293
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.620
Las Vegas,
Miami.
The best thing about it,
if I be fat,

294
00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.070
if I do at Miami Gig is that I can

295
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.390
<v 1>do the gig and be like,
Hey,</v>

296
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:53.470
my DJ set starts at midnight and Miami's like,

297
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:54.630
that's what time I'm waking up.

298
00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.240
<v 5>Yeah,
sure.
Let me tell you something.
What I love about this deejaying Gig yeah.</v>

299
00:20:58.241 --> 00:21:03.130
Is that it really combines everything you love in life,
which is staying up late.

300
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:07.460
Yeah.
Late nights hanging out with tons of strangers.
Yeah.

301
00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:09.380
Loud music.
Yeah.

302
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:13.810
Your favorite places like Vegas,
Miami,

303
00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.440
these are all things that just say Tom Segura exclusively.

304
00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:23.920
Um,
lights.
Just like that whole rowdy sort of,

305
00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.060
I see you then.
That is your lane.
So you've really found a good lane.

306
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.270
Stay with it.
Tom.
Ever seen so happy.
Yeah.

307
00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.850
<v 1>Ever see me happy?
And then you tweeted,
yeah,
when I tweeted this out,</v>

308
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.360
I hate seeing you.
So happy.
Yeah.

309
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.220
<v 5>I give you,</v>

310
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:57.070
I give you two or three of these before you're like,
I don't know,

311
00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:00.700
two or three what gigs.
Here's,
here's my prediction.

312
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.290
Dj Dad mouth after two shows on a late night Saturday.
Yeah.
And you're like,
oh,

313
00:22:05.291 --> 00:22:09.580
I got this thing lined up to Dj and then after him are on 1230 midnight after

314
00:22:09.581 --> 00:22:13.180
you've done your two and two and a half,
three hours of standup.
Yeah.
Exhausted.

315
00:22:13.181 --> 00:22:13.630
Yeah.

316
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:17.830
You flown across the country and you've been up doing press that morning at 5:00

317
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:21.910
AM you're going to be dreading it and then you know you'll do it and he'll be

318
00:22:21.911 --> 00:22:22.091
like,

319
00:22:22.091 --> 00:22:25.420
I wish I didn't have a fucking DJ tonight and wait until you see the crowds.

320
00:22:25.421 --> 00:22:27.800
I have just like how they just jump

321
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.450
<v 1>Ben and singing and dancing.
It's going to be crazy.</v>

322
00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:33.923
I can't wait.

323
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.920
I'm going to call Macio and then I get some tips from him too.
Okay.

324
00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:44.770
<v 5>Why don't you talk to Dj scratch starting from scratch.
I might talk to you.
Yeah,</v>

325
00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.200
that guy is cool.
It Shit.
Yeah,
they're all just the other dude.

326
00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:51.870
<v 1>They're all cool man.
Um,
oh,
so I probably should have left that up.</v>

327
00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:56.250
Want to fucking kill myself to you put this.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Here it is by the way.

328
00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:01.050
Um,
do you know you haven't seen it yet,

329
00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:06.570
but I was in,
when I was in Cleveland,
I stopped by the,

330
00:23:06.571 --> 00:23:09.890
uh,
local morning TV show.
Yeah.

331
00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:14.730
And I,
oh,
I probably should open it here.
I,
um,

332
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.920
I did a little interview.
It looks good.

333
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:25.050
And uh,
WWE people were digging it,
man.
You know,
I,

334
00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.280
I did something that you might not be expecting,
but I just wanted to show you,

335
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.870
<v 5>you know,
we are,
and we welcome a guy like this onto the show.</v>

336
00:23:33.871 --> 00:23:38.580
Welcome Ohio Native Comedian Thompson Gora folks.
So,

337
00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:42.390
okay.
Before we get into this set out to everybody all over the world doing their

338
00:23:42.391 --> 00:23:46.400
thing and stuff like that,
shout out to dany acts x Vlp

339
00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:51.660
<v 6>you know what I'm saying?
Got It.
So,</v>

340
00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:56.510
okay,
this guy,
I didn't want to know anything about him before he came on.

341
00:23:56.511 --> 00:23:59.420
I thought it was a lot of mystery behind these sunglasses.

342
00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:02.000
I started asking him some questions like,
you know what,
I'm just going to stop.

343
00:24:02.001 --> 00:24:04.010
So this is one big surprise coming up here.

344
00:24:04.011 --> 00:24:06.440
So I first want to welcome you tell you,

345
00:24:06.441 --> 00:24:09.770
I think you have the coolest style of any comedian that has come on the show.

346
00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:13.220
I appreciate you.
Thank you.
This is your,
this is your lock normally

347
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.060
coming from Ohio,
being from Cincinnati,

348
00:24:17.061 --> 00:24:21.160
like where do you kind of get your inspiration,
I guess from your clothes,

349
00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:25.310
you know,
from the streets.
Mostly I travel,

350
00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:32.060
I just picked it up from,
you know,
fight,
fight and people,

351
00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.590
you know,
beef in like I got this,
you know,
I don't know.

352
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.040
Why aren't you had some beef with crazy low cost.
Yeah.

353
00:24:40.041 --> 00:24:44.900
It's funny you mentioned those.
So he's this rapper from San Jose,

354
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:49.940
right?
That has been challenging me on youtube wanting to fight.

355
00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:52.610
Physically fight.
Yeah.

356
00:24:52.611 --> 00:24:56.180
He wants to step in the ring and he's been working out at like target and

357
00:24:56.181 --> 00:24:58.910
Walmart training and stuff.
Yup.
And you know,

358
00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:03.530
I just want him to know that I've been in home depot and staples and I've been

359
00:25:03.531 --> 00:25:06.590
throwing around like two by fours and I'm just ready to get down.

360
00:25:06.591 --> 00:25:08.930
I just want him,
you know what I'm saying?
I want him to know,
you feel me.

361
00:25:08.931 --> 00:25:10.820
Don't talk back.
I'm saying that I'm ready to do this.

362
00:25:10.821 --> 00:25:14.510
So whenever he wants to step in the ring,
we can get down.
All right,

363
00:25:14.511 --> 00:25:15.530
well that's a challenge.

364
00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.180
<v 1>All right.
Oh,
that's a challenge actually.
I got to get her,</v>

365
00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:23.200
she really went with the whole role.
What's your roll with it?
Yeah.

366
00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:27.430
What a horrible job.
Her job.
I mean,
well,
yeah,

367
00:25:27.431 --> 00:25:30.250
I mean the thing I was thinking about too is how many of the,
um,

368
00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:32.860
of the other morning shows I've done where they would've just been like,

369
00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:35.060
we got to go.
They just came out.
Yeah.

370
00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:40.210
<v 6>I want the whole world to know that just reached out to crazy low so we can,</v>

371
00:25:40.211 --> 00:25:42.190
we can do this whenever he wants to do it.
Okay.

372
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.950
Well I don't want to mess with you then.
Do you do this with other comedians to,

373
00:25:44.951 --> 00:25:47.860
do you get into these?
Uh,
I mean,
if they want to feel these hands,
yeah,

374
00:25:47.861 --> 00:25:51.100
they shouldn't.
They can.
They can let me know and I'll let them know right back.

375
00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.060
You know,
I try to keep it,
you know,
pretty easy.

376
00:25:55.061 --> 00:25:58.760
Most of the time if I'm deejaying or if I'm Dj as well.
Yeah.

377
00:25:58.770 --> 00:25:59.980
I'll be deejaying this weekend here.

378
00:25:59.981 --> 00:26:03.370
I'm a tweet out a location for a pop up show,
so I'll be,

379
00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.560
I didn't even realize that.

380
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:09.640
<v 1>How fucking serendipitous that was because that was before the</v>

381
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:13.070
call.
That too.
Yeah.

382
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.340
<v 6>Stand up.
I'll be doing some,
some sites.</v>

383
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:22.410
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Gymnastics.

384
00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:27.120
I do that.
I mean,
I hear you laughing,
but I'm actually pretty damn good at.
Yeah,

385
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:30.090
yeah,
yeah.
I mean I could do,
if I wanted to,
I could do six flips right here.

386
00:26:30.091 --> 00:26:33.060
Right now.
Bam,
Bam,
Bam,
Bam,
Bam,
Bam.

387
00:26:33.061 --> 00:26:35.070
But if we didn't have these cameras right here,
I would,

388
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.810
and I don't want to pay that,
but yeah.

389
00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:44.760
Jim just as well,
gymnast.
I'm an trainer.
I train dogs.

390
00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.390
Um,
I can train.
I am actually one of the few guys that can train cats.

391
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:50.680
<v 1>It's too,
by the way,</v>

392
00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:55.210
that was the closest I came to laughing really hard.

393
00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:59.830
I had to bite my lip a little bit when I said that.
I was like,
it's so stupid.

394
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:01.260
So

395
00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:05.640
<v 6>lot of people,
what's the coolest thing?
I'm about to laugh right there.
Uh,</v>

396
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.900
probably answer a phone.
Mister Jinx with the

397
00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.830
flushing the toilet.
Did they know how to do that too?
I tried to cat if he could,

398
00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:18.070
if he hears the phone ring.

399
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.740
Yeah,
he could hit the speaker phone button.

400
00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.620
That's what you're calling.
He's,
let me see your hand

401
00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:42.640
<v 1>moves the hand.
Somebody was going,
oh,
I hate that.
I ruined the phone.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

402
00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:46.900
Betty ways.
You know,
I put it out there man.
So great.

403
00:27:46.901 --> 00:27:51.220
So they must have heard your call.
I feel like the,
the world,

404
00:27:51.221 --> 00:27:54.070
but I'm also talking about locally,
I put it out there for looks,
you know.
Oh,

405
00:27:54.071 --> 00:27:58.810
right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
um,
it's pretty,
uh,

410
00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:22.860
It's probably the worst moment ever in the history of,

411
00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:25.660

<v 1>it's way too fucking long.</v>

422

432
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:18.840
No retail store can get on some logos and stuff like that.

433
00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:22.770

<v 3>that was your black eyes or is that pain?</v>

440
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:53.810
Doesn't that look like black eyes?
It's an iron deficiency.
Okay,

441
00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.330
This is amazing.
This guy found crazy lugs.
He did.

442
00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.940
This guy was at my show and Sacramento.

443
00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.200
And did he give you a heads up like hey he was like one of the front row guys

458
00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:04.240
Are we going to do this?

We'll be waiting and gotten no response.

466
00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:35.330
Move the government and everybody doing their sign.

467
00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:40.190
Kuma wrap on the way out.
Quiz

468
00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.620
<v 9>loads from the mica straight to us.
Right until it was so good.</v>

469
00:32:42.621 --> 00:32:46.040
Hope you understand.
I keep it so chill when I spit and they'll feel bored.

470
00:32:46.041 --> 00:32:49.570
I said,
have a straight to phone Pharma.
He affirmed at temple for no brainer.

471
00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:54.650
Chris in Los is a thug,
is going to maintain it in every way.
No play.

472
00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:59.320
<v 5>Okay.
So yeah,
I'm sorry,
I'm just processing it.</v>

473
00:32:59.321 --> 00:33:02.010
I don't feel like I can't,
my brain can't comprehend it.

474
00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:06.880
<v 1>So this dude on the REIT owns a restaurant.
Mm.</v>

475
00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:11.960
And that came up during the show.
Um,
many ways.

476
00:33:11.961 --> 00:33:16.190
He was like,
we were just talking about that.
And then I think it was,

477
00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:17.240
I forget how far it is from,

478
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.360
I think he said he just drove two hours to meet crazy legs.
Oh my God.

479
00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:25.150
So at the end of this video,
because this ends here pretty quickly,
right?
Yeah.

480
00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.150
And then it's like,

481
00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:31.510
it's just him making a video that he actually shot on the way to meet crazy.

482
00:33:31.701 --> 00:33:35.960
Lokes um,
so I guess he took to heart the,
uh,
you know,

483
00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.570
the part where before I was saying we could do,

484
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:42.950
we could get together and sell tickets and do a charity thing.

485
00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:48.140
He is suggesting we do one for mental health awareness.
Hey,

486
00:33:48.141 --> 00:33:50.390
that's great.
Let's do it.
Well,

487
00:33:50.391 --> 00:33:53.300
we just have to figure out what exactly are we selling tickets to.

488
00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.490
It's really up to you.
So Laura,
I know you said I could spar him,

489
00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:00.760
but I mean come on.

490
00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:05.570
<v 5>I don't know.
Is that really?
Does that a good idea?
Yeah.
Let's,</v>

491
00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:07.270
let's marinate on this amount.

492
00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:10.290
<v 1>Maybe deejaying challenge.</v>

493
00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:14.220
Go lokes isn't a Dj's is a rapper.
Hello?

494
00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:18.900
So you want to do a show with them?
Hello?
Yes,

495
00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:22.500
obviously.
And then the greatest rappers,
one of the greatest Dj's alive.

496
00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:26.070
Oh my God.
Together.
Do you think you could sell tickets to that?

497
00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.700
I think to our fans,
we could.
I mean,
if you're,
if you're donating to charity,

498
00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:33.810
you're not selling tickets to,
you know,

499
00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:38.990
actually for what you're doing in nor cal or so cow.
We'll do in nor cal.

500
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:43.410
I think that's an idea.
I don't,
I'm not saying it's set in stone,

501
00:34:43.411 --> 00:34:44.460
but I think that's a good idea.

502
00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:48.400
<v 5>Okay,
well here's another idea.
Okay.
Hear me out.
All right.</v>

503
00:34:48.450 --> 00:34:52.470
Why don't we do a fucking your mom's house podcast live.

504
00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:55.590
Oh yeah.
And invite crazy looks down and you,

505
00:34:55.591 --> 00:35:00.000
and do that and make it like a fucking massive,
your mom's house event.

506
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:00.781
That's a good idea.

507
00:35:00.781 --> 00:35:05.280
And then maybe the big finale is you and crazy lokes deejaying and you guys can

508
00:35:05.281 --> 00:35:09.570
kind of prepare and you know.
Yeah.
And we can,
that will be really crazy.

509
00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:14.640
Crazier than crazy,
crazy,
crazy looks.
What do you think?
So kind of good idea.

510
00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:18.720
And we can get a huge venue.
I think this is going to be Norco.
Norco.
No.

511
00:35:18.721 --> 00:35:20.070
So cow do it down here.

512
00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:24.190
<v 1>You got to bring crazy looks down dude.
We go up there.
Okay,</v>

513
00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:29.120
well see that's what I think we did.
I think we'd go up there and do it.
Okay.

514
00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:34.460
Because you could also everybody,
we could,
we could,
you know,

515
00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:39.390
invite the,
every Sacramento listener,
every San Jose,

516
00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:44.660
<v 3>San Francisco Scouts could come out to be a big thing.
Look,
let's,
let's,</v>

517
00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:47.770
I think that's a great idea.
That'd be really fun.
No.

518
00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:51.740
And how much we have to donate to charity.
Yeah,

519
00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:56.360
we could do that would be good.
That'd be awesome.
I can't,

520
00:35:56.361 --> 00:35:57.940
I can't believe this happened.
Um,

521
00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:02.640
it's very surreal when they actually talk back to you.
Yeah.
It's a very weird,

522
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:03.390
the dude,

523
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:05.610
<v 1>the video,
he's like,
you got my email.
I'll have your email.</v>

524
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:09.690
It says the emails in this where you don't put it on the screen.

525
00:36:09.691 --> 00:36:13.550
Where's your email?

I feel like we got to go through him.</v>

527
00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:20.800

530
00:36:30.091 --> 00:36:34.660

Right.

531
00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:39.010
Yeah.

542
00:37:14.401 --> 00:37:17.400

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:21.110
<v 10>see where it is high.
So yeah,
we were sending,</v>

544
00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:26.170
this is my official you of eating ass.

545
00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:29.640
<v 1>Okay.
Okay.</v>

546
00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:34.710
This is something that I feel like you need to watch with.

547
00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.230
I think you need to pay a little better attention to,
right.

548
00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:41.130
This is like one of the courses you didn't do well in school,
you know,

549
00:37:41.131 --> 00:37:43.860
so it's like,
hey,
you got to go.
But was it something that I'm,

550
00:37:43.861 --> 00:37:47.520
hopefully it hits you in the heart,
you know,
you're ready.

551
00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.090
<v 3>What else did you do this weekend?
Any see any movie?</v>

552
00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.210
<v 10>Hi.</v>

553
00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:57.210
So this video is my official for you.

554
00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:01.630
She's like 12 of eating ashes.
This we can true.

555
00:38:01.631 --> 00:38:06.631
Suddenly I had the pleasure of eating ass.

556
00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:11.290
People have asked me then I said,
why?

557
00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:16.900
And I say,
why not?
We have asked me how was it?

558
00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:18.303
Yeah.

559
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:23.550
And I have given lots of slot into this question and I have decided that it

560
00:38:23.561 --> 00:38:28.060
would be best that I just make a general view in my one experience.

561
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:33.470
<v 1>She's um,
I don't know if she put the music on for this moment though,
right?</v>

562
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:35.563
<v 10>Yeah,</v>

563
00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.140
<v 3>no.
First of all,</v>

564
00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:44.770
I rate the experience is 6.5 out of 10.

565
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:46.930
That's not rationally.
I rated it a six,

566
00:38:46.931 --> 00:38:50.560
but I gave it some thought and I think a 6.5 is more fitting.

567
00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:56.380
I just really want you to think about that on the terms of how enjoyable it

568
00:38:56.451 --> 00:38:58.520
might be for you.
You know,

569
00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.450
damn dog,
he's our dog.

570
00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.750
<v 10>Um,
I guess I weigh out the pros and cons.</v>

571
00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:12.660
Pros and eating ass.
The other person on Juliet.
Thank you,

572
00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.600
joy.
Thank you.

573
00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:16.520
<v 3>No one cares about that.
Your spouse</v>

574
00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:21.500
<v 10>people.
Another pro is that it doesn't taste bad.</v>

575
00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:22.940
Most people think that.

576
00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:25.920
<v 3>So I'm gonna think about which dumbed,
yeah,</v>

577
00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:29.920
<v 10>it's bad or they think it will taste like,</v>

578
00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:35.100
but it doesn't go exactly like any,
that's so dumb body person at all.

579
00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:40.070
<v 3>Okay.
If I let something that has jelly coming out of it,</v>

580
00:39:40.071 --> 00:39:44.810
it's going to taste like jelly coming out of a donut that has the chocolate

581
00:39:44.811 --> 00:39:46.630
coming out of it in the hall.

582
00:39:46.631 --> 00:39:50.270
Then looks like chocolate chocolate coming out.

583
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:53.360
There's no chocolate coming in.
The chocolate lives there,

584
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:55.670
but it's not coming out the chocolate.

585
00:39:55.850 --> 00:40:00.620
It smells like the container from which it comes.
It's,
you know,
like when you,

586
00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:04.610
you keep something in a bowl or something and it retains the olders.

587
00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:09.380
It's how you have to sterilize it so that it doesn't,

588
00:40:09.381 --> 00:40:12.860
she's crazy.
This person who's telling you crazy like a dany act

589
00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:18.570
<v 10>for whatever reason,
it just,
it doesn't taste like anything.
There you go.</v>

590
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:20.140
So hard to do chocolate.

591
00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:27.580
So can I have my coffee?
The pros,
the cons would be,

592
00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:32.930
I would say the biggest time is this smell.
It doesn't smell that great.

593
00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:36.940
<v 3>Then how does it taste?
Tastes good.
If it smells bad,
dub down.</v>

594
00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:41.720
She says it doesn't smell that great.
Well what?
Come on man.

595
00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.480
That's a very distinct,

596
00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:48.430
I mean the witness said,
okay,

597
00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:51.500
it doesn't smell great and he's good.

598
00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:54.790
That could imply that it smells good but not great.

599
00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:58.360
My granny used to cook a few things that didn't smell great,

600
00:40:58.361 --> 00:40:59.470
but I'm sure they taste good.

601
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.850
<v 10>You could also ask the person to</v>

602
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:11.140
wash their ass real quick before there's not a problem.

603
00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:16.630
The smallest pleasant,
but the smells very bearable.

604
00:41:16.631 --> 00:41:19.180
I would say it's from this morning.

605
00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:24.670
Another con would be sometimes this person has not shaped their ass and that's

606
00:41:24.671 --> 00:41:25.870
totally fine.

607
00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:28.020
<v 3>I can take care of that too.</v>

608
00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.920
<v 10>But if you're not a fan of hair,</v>

609
00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:33.710
then you probably won't appreciate.

610
00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:38.410
<v 1>How mortified would you be?
Just if you were,
uh,
you know,
uh,</v>

611
00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:42.190
older,
a little older parents,
you see this video of your dad,

612
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:48.230
you're like,
of all the videos she could pose,

613
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:53.540
<v 10>do the amount of hair that to potentially be somebody.</v>

614
00:41:55.570 --> 00:42:00.550
I think that's it for the cons.
So essentially the cons,
the pros way of the coms.

615
00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:05.170
Thank you.
Um,
and so,
you know,
I read it a 6.5.

616
00:42:05.171 --> 00:42:06.760
I didn't think it was that bad at all.

617
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.610
I was expecting worse and it wasn't that bad.
Um,

618
00:42:09.611 --> 00:42:11.710
so now that we got the review out of the way,

619
00:42:11.711 --> 00:42:16.711
I would also like to address something that I was pretty upset about after this

620
00:42:19.121 --> 00:42:20.080
event happened.

621
00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:26.010
I was very upset after I eat us because of the amount of people who I've heard

622
00:42:26.651 --> 00:42:29.510
say,
I don't need us.
Okay.
How are you done with us?

623
00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:34.770
<v 1>This is good.
Look into those eyes and she's looking at you right now.
Okay.
Okay.</v>

624
00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:35.633
All right.

625
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:37.703
<v 10>Okay.</v>

626
00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:42.050
<v 1>Yeah,
we can be done,
but I just want you to think about it a little bit.</v>

627
00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.730
<v 5>Did I mention the movie that I narrated is out?</v>

628
00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:51.150
Do you have the names I can pull up?
Said the film I narrated.
It's,
um,

629
00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:54.480
it's out and,
um,
you know,
festivals and whatnot.

630
00:42:54.481 --> 00:42:59.140
It's called can we take a joke?
I'm the narrator.

631
00:42:59.141 --> 00:43:03.160
Gilbert Godfrey,
Lisa Lampanelli,
Penn Jillette is in it.

632
00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:08.340
And it's about the,
how political correctness is destroying the comedy world.
Um,

633
00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:09.760
pretty interesting stuff.

634
00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:13.840
And did you know that there's a comedian being sued right now in Canada?

635
00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:16.720
I sure did.
Yeah.
Ah,
it's just heartbreaking.

636
00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:22.220
<v 1>They're really strict law about saying fuck boys and making fun of people.</v>

637
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:26.770
Boy That's really lame.
I love you Canada.
But that's lame.
Yeah.

638
00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:28.490
I feel like I could have fucking,

639
00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:31.770
there's a few times I've been there where I could have gotten in trouble.
Yeah.

640
00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:36.290
Because he made fun of uh,
that guy in Canada made fun of a disabled.

641
00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.080
Yes.
A person.

642
00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:43.130
<v 5>Yeah.
Little boy.
Yeah.
Went to sing for the pope or something.
Yeah.</v>

643
00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.890
And the line was like,
you know,

644
00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:48.580
I don't expect that kid to live long and he ended up living subset or

645
00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:53.640
<v 1>cares,
whatever.
I mean joke,
but it's something like,
uh,
when I did my,</v>

646
00:43:53.641 --> 00:43:57.270
um,
my conjoined twins,

647
00:43:57.271 --> 00:44:00.550
but I feel like that could have been taken in Canada the way I know.

648
00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:01.350
It's terrifying.

649
00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:03.380
<v 11>If I have the right to say anything,</v>

650
00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:08.010
you certainly have the right to be offended if I can say anything I want.

651
00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:12.210
You can say pension.
The said that.
And you can say,

652
00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.000
Penn shouldn't have said that.
None of us should talk to him anymore.

653
00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.000
And pension to said that we should,

654
00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:20.370
he shouldn't have a job and pension has said that and he's not funny.

655
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:22.780
Pen shouldn't have said that.
We're going to put a pic,

656
00:44:22.781 --> 00:44:24.990
it's out in front of the club and he should be able to go to that club.

657
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.530
All that is within your rights and very clearly within your rights,

658
00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:31.380
but just like,
uh,

659
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:37.100
every individual has to make a decision on just because they can say something

660
00:44:38.011 --> 00:44:40.050
doesn't mean they have to say it.

661
00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:45.990
Individuals have to make the decision that just because you might feel offended

662
00:44:45.991 --> 00:44:49.620
by something doesn't mean you have to announce you're offended.
Yeah.

663
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:55.070
<v 5>So there you go.
It's a really,
really timely documentary.
It's,
it's weird.</v>

664
00:44:55.071 --> 00:44:59.190
These guys started making it right and it's all kind of exploded since then.

665
00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:03.310
They covered that story about that woman who tweeted a,

666
00:45:03.311 --> 00:45:06.120
she was on her way to South Africa.
Yeah.
That she was like,

667
00:45:06.121 --> 00:45:10.020
I hope I don't get aids.
Just kidding.
I'm white and not the greatest job,

668
00:45:10.021 --> 00:45:12.450
but who cares?
And she ended up losing her job.

669
00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.490
She ended up having to change her name.

670
00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:17.670
They couldn't even get her to be in the documentary because she's like,

671
00:45:17.671 --> 00:45:20.830
I'm not fucking touching the subject again.
I got into so much trouble over.

672
00:45:20.831 --> 00:45:21.664
I'd tweet.

673
00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:26.270
<v 1>I feel like this is such a cool Gig,
uh,
for you to get as soon as the best,</v>

674
00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:30.020
not only is it the cool gig of narrating something,
which is a good Gig,

675
00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:32.660
but this topic every,

676
00:45:32.661 --> 00:45:35.540
basically every comedian feels this way about it.

677
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:37.310
And you're the voice of the film.

678
00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:40.520
<v 5>Yeah.
I'm so,
I'm so private.
Ted Balaguer did it.
Okay.</v>

679
00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:44.470
<v 1>So here's a little write up in maxim,
a new documentary.
Can we take a joke?</v>

680
00:45:44.471 --> 00:45:48.270
Presents us with their side of the issue directed by Ted,

681
00:45:48.271 --> 00:45:51.570
by Alec are narrated by Comedian Christina [inaudible].
Keith,
did I say it right?

682
00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:55.500
The film shows how luminaries like Gilbert Godfrey,

683
00:45:55.501 --> 00:45:58.830
Penn Jillette least Leben Ellie,
Adam Carolla,
Jim Norton,

684
00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:02.670
Heather McDonald have grappled with this trend in American culture.

685
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:06.140
Spoiler alert.
They're not too thrilled about it.
Um,

686
00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:08.960
it looks like it's been doing well at the fit.

687
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:13.350
<v 5>First of all,
services are great.
It's,
it's,
I don't know yet how to see it,</v>

688
00:46:13.351 --> 00:46:17.610
but it's called,
can we take a joke?
I think it just debuted.
It's really cool.

689
00:46:17.611 --> 00:46:21.060
I can't wait to,
I haven't seen it.
I haven't seen it with my narration.
And it,

690
00:46:21.061 --> 00:46:25.250
but I've seen it in like the,
the raw as I was narrating it.
So it's,

691
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:29.680
it's so cool.
I mean,
so be clear on the timely thing to,
to comedians

692
00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:31.030
<v 1>basically feel</v>

693
00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:37.530
the way that Penn just mentioned there that's basically summarizes.

694
00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:42.980
Yeah.
Which is that you have the right to um,

695
00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.180
feel any way you want to feel about a joke,

696
00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:51.510
but it's the idea that your feeling that way outweighs everything else that is

697
00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:53.650
outrageous.

698
00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:58.480
<v 5>Yeah.
Well,
and also like to have your feelings hurt.
It's fine,</v>

699
00:46:58.481 --> 00:47:02.890
but hurt feelings don't want people losing their jobs.
Yeah.
I'm like that woman,

700
00:47:02.891 --> 00:47:06.610
I tweeted something,
okay,
yeah,
we get it.
It's really racially insensitive.

701
00:47:06.611 --> 00:47:10.690
But did she deserve to lose her livelihood and have it ruined her life because

702
00:47:10.691 --> 00:47:12.610
she said something,
she says something without thinking.

703
00:47:12.611 --> 00:47:15.430
She was trying to be funny and fail.
Like it wasn't,

704
00:47:15.431 --> 00:47:20.110
she wasn't inciting violence against.
People are playing clips that are like,

705
00:47:20.111 --> 00:47:23.530
hey hiller you know what I mean?
Like she wasn't doing those things right.

706
00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:27.490
Like Gilbert Gilbert lost his job.
He does the AFLAC.
Yeah.
AFLAC

707
00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:31.380
<v 1>voice because of tweets,
joke,
tweet,
you know,
they are,</v>

708
00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:36.190
they're obviously not the sweetest tweets,
but that's,
you know,
he's a comedian.

709
00:47:36.191 --> 00:47:36.940
That's what he's known.
Yeah.

710
00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:40.350
<v 5>And he's a comedian who is known for being cantankerous.
Yeah.</v>

711
00:47:40.351 --> 00:47:43.510
And saying crazy shit.
So if you want the guy who's not going to say that,

712
00:47:43.511 --> 00:47:48.150
don't hire Gilbert as your,
it's so corny,
like,
yeah.
Anyway,

713
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:51.880
you're going to you,
it's the cover a lot of other examples of what's happening,

714
00:47:51.881 --> 00:47:53.620
especially on college campuses,

715
00:47:53.621 --> 00:47:56.980
which is kind of really alarming because that's supposed to be where you debate

716
00:47:56.981 --> 00:48:00.120
ideas of all kinds and now there's a resistance,

717
00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:03.310
even debating ideas that are considered political.

718
00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:08.000
<v 1>Please.
Also this movement of I've seen amongst some comedians of supporting,</v>

719
00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:09.750
<v 5>no,
yeah.
Political.
Correct.</v>

720
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:15.190
<v 1>So I guess I actually misspoke when I said this is the universal comedian,</v>

721
00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:17.050
um,
approach.

722
00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:21.280
It's the universal good comedians response to that stuff.

723
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:26.430
So basically every comedian that I see defending that isn't worth a shit.

724
00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:32.180
Yeah,
I agree.
So yeah.
It's um,
it's fucking terrible.
Yeah.

725
00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.150
<v 5>Well even,
um,
there was something I heard on the doctor Laura show.</v>

726
00:48:35.151 --> 00:48:39.350
I listened to her for a laugh where they,
uh,
there was someone in a university,

727
00:48:39.351 --> 00:48:42.800
a Catholic university defending same sex marriage,
just being like,

728
00:48:42.801 --> 00:48:47.420
I believe marriage is between a man and got thrown out of class and called a

729
00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:52.360
bigot and the hatred and all this crap.
Offending cat,
the Catholic stance.
So not,

730
00:48:52.361 --> 00:48:55.920
you said defending same sex marriage.
Oh,
sorry.
Defending traditional marriage.

731
00:48:55.921 --> 00:49:00.380
Okay.
Sorry.
Like old school marriage and the,
um,
the teacher was like,

732
00:49:00.381 --> 00:49:04.370
that's hateful.
How dare you,
like,
well,
okay,
maybe,
but why not debate it?

733
00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:08.010
We not figure it out and this kid got in and just let that person think that you

734
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:12.260
care.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So interesting and interesting.
I know the world is,

735
00:49:12.261 --> 00:49:17.000
it's a very interesting place
that comedians actually defend.

736
00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:17.893
Oh,

737
00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:23.220
<v 1>the political correctness stuff I read,
I have not,
I've yet to see one good one.</v>

738
00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:25.860
Um,
it's always somebody who,

739
00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:30.000
who basically walks around with a lot of feelings in their comedy.

740
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:34.860
So like,
they want that defended,
you know,

741
00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:39.240
that that's kind of what they carry around is that they're,
they're,

742
00:49:39.241 --> 00:49:42.990
they're very sensitive,
which is fine.
Right,
right,
right.
Um,
but I,

743
00:49:42.991 --> 00:49:46.680
I haven't really seen many a working comics.
No,

744
00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:49.770
<v 5>no.
Working me that and also where do you draw the line?</v>

745
00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:53.850
Like how do you know what's not going to offend anybody?
What's the safe joke?

746
00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:55.590
Am I going to tell it?
Talk,

747
00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:59.480
tell jokes about balloons or is there some kind of balloon league that's going

748
00:49:59.481 --> 00:50:02.780
to get mad?
Cause I'm harming the integrity of balloons.
You know,
it's,
yeah.

749
00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:07.020
It's just,
it goes on and on.
There's no,
I know.
Oh,
that's makes me crazy.

750
00:50:07.021 --> 00:50:11.010
It's a topic that makes me crazy.
It makes me crazy too.
Anyway,
go see it.

751
00:50:11.011 --> 00:50:12.240
Can we take a joke?
Cuts out?

752
00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:16.630
<v 1>Um,
we have,
uh,
what is this a voicemail that came in from a fan yet?</v>

753
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:20.660
But I play it.
How do we get that talent?
Some Italian lady is calling them.

754
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:25.140
<v 5>Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
And the cheat sheet.
Okay.</v>

755
00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:30.170
I think getting Persian voicemails and Razah.
Joan.
Really?
Yeah.

756
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:35.180
Yeah.
Not as many.
It's only been like one in the last month or so.

757
00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:38.550
<v 1>Okay.
Um,
let's see.
We have this,</v>

758
00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:46.290
hello?
Is there the professional composer?
No.
Yeah,

759
00:50:46.350 --> 00:50:49.770
it should be the first one in the fan mail section.
Oh,
it's not an inquiry.

760
00:50:49.771 --> 00:50:50.710
I got you.
Yeah.

761
00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:53.010
<v 5>By the way,
it was really neat.
Um,</v>

762
00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:57.660
am I shows at flappers when I would walk up to stage to have fans yelling,

763
00:50:57.661 --> 00:51:02.520
Hey Hitler,
uh,
here,
like I don't know how to respond to you right now.

764
00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:06.550
Oh my God.
Not Everybody in this audience is a Miami guys and the same thing.

765
00:51:06.551 --> 00:51:09.970
And the guy's like,
come on man,
Hitler.

766
00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:14.640
And I'm like fuck me in my ass.
And the one guy was like,
after he goes,

767
00:51:14.641 --> 00:51:17.430
I was going to give you a Heil Hitler.
And I go,
why don't you not?

768
00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:19.480
Why are you parked this where it's at now?

769
00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:24.240
Not I'm someone goes during the middle of my set,
I choose retarded.

770
00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:28.740
And I started laughing and then I did the would you rather for the audience,

771
00:51:28.741 --> 00:51:32.430
cause I had to feel like I had to fill them in.
Not so much time.
So good.

772
00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:37.170
Broad that show to a screeching halt I had that.
Some people find funny,

773
00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:42.470
<v 1>some people might not,
people didn't not into it.
Yeah.
Alright.
A Fan mail.</v>

774
00:51:42.471 --> 00:51:45.710
Here we go to the mommy.
This may concern over the past few months,

775
00:51:45.711 --> 00:51:50.711
I've woken up to occasional voicemails from a stranger in Italy or so.

776
00:51:51.471 --> 00:51:55.340
I thought today she called during the day and she used the Italian version of my

777
00:51:55.341 --> 00:51:56.980
name to greet me,
Matteo,

778
00:51:57.650 --> 00:52:02.650
and I believe was trying to claim to know me instead of the usual Chow Paula

779
00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.900
leading me to believe this may be a prank,

780
00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:09.830
someone I know or maybe something far more sinister.

781
00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:13.610
I beg for your help by seeing if any mommies out there can translate these

782
00:52:13.611 --> 00:52:17.330
voicemails for me.
I must get to the bottom of this somehow.
Also,

783
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:19.940
the voicemails themselves are pretty funny and Italian,

784
00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:24.400
but probably funnier if I knew what the Brown she was saying,
Huh?

785
00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:28.910
I've sent the first voicemail from three months ago along with this email over

786
00:52:28.911 --> 00:52:29.840
and out,
Matt.

787
00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:34.790
So we've got to have a fluent Italian listener for sure.
Without a doubt.

788
00:52:34.850 --> 00:52:39.080
I speak it.
I can translate it.
So now this makes more sense.
Uh,

789
00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:42.770
let me see if I can play it now.
Let's see what,
so this is basically,

790
00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:47.440
this person's in the same boat as you.
Yeah.
Um,
with the Persian voicemails.
Yeah.

791
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:50.780
That,
that were ended up being absolutely fucking hilarious.

792
00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:53.960
<v 5>That,
and then I ate us who was a mental patient,
right?</v>

793
00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:56.510
They fled his life and then I was getting panicked.

794
00:52:56.511 --> 00:53:01.511
Eight as voicemails and then Shanaze who's the nurse who's been getting a lot of

795
00:53:01.581 --> 00:53:06.260
business proposals and Shanaz hasn't been answering.
Damn man.

796
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:09.500
So many people had that number.
So many people,
I don't know why.

797
00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:12.200
Quick turnaround too.
I know.
Great.

798
00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:16.700
At least I don't have bad credit.
The worst is getting a,
the creditor calls,

799
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:18.880
which happened on our last home line.

800
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:21.470
<v 12>Gerald Brown are Shamara GME died.</v>

801
00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:25.830
[inaudible] the dop,
Chateau

802
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:33.120
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] to,
to,
to echo.

803
00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:38.130
And we keep paying show [inaudible] normality.

804
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:41.250
If you showed me two time to child,
well,
a child,

805
00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:44.140
<v 3>I can basically translate this.
No,
I'm translating this.</v>

806
00:53:44.141 --> 00:53:46.990
I told you I speak Italian.
No,
no.
I really can basically translate that.

807
00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:49.000
What is it?
Oh,
okay.
Would you want to go for it?
Well,

808
00:53:49.001 --> 00:53:54.001
she's asking about the Volkswagen Passat or the echo.

809
00:53:54.521 --> 00:53:58.750
Which one does I want to drive more?
Is that what you got?
A,

810
00:53:58.751 --> 00:54:01.570
I got a little different.
First of all,
I don't think this is a prank.

811
00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:03.550
I think this is a genuine phone call.

812
00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:08.970
I'll tell you from my limited Italian and Spanish that is very close and a lot

813
00:54:09.641 --> 00:54:12.190
of words what is going on is it sounds,
first of all,

814
00:54:12.370 --> 00:54:16.400
definitely like an old woman.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Okay.
Sorry Gerald.

815
00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:18.410
<v 12>[inaudible]</v>

816
00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:23.190
<v 3>so it's,
it's child power lies.
Hi Paula.
So I thought she was calling you my tale,</v>

817
00:54:23.191 --> 00:54:26.160
but she says blah.
So she's talking about that says who should

818
00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:28.093
<v 12>give me a shot?</v>

819
00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:33.700
<v 3>Sham,
I'm sending you a thousand like I'm greeting you,
right?</v>

820
00:54:33.730 --> 00:54:37.500
Hello?
Yeah,
like a thousand hugs a hell,

821
00:54:37.501 --> 00:54:39.230
hell or high alert.
Yeah.

822
00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:44.330
<v 12>Pop in Chateau [inaudible] and they knew Tali,</v>

823
00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:49.050
<v 1>uh,
uh,
thinking of,
I dunno,</v>

824
00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:54.090
I forget if it was as if she's Ah,
fuck something about medicine.

825
00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:55.260
It sounds like maybe

826
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:59.810
<v 12>[inaudible]</v>

827
00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:03.220
<v 3>yeah.
Wondering if you got the Passat or not.</v>

828
00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:06.360
<v 12>Why keep paying show we know.</v>

829
00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:08.240
<v 3>Depends who I'm thinking about,
right.</v>

830
00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:12.740
<v 12>If you show him two times,
so Ciao Bella.</v>

831
00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:18.090
<v 1>And then,
you know,
sending you hugs and bye,</v>

832
00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:20.220
bye.
Beautiful.
So

833
00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:23.430
<v 3>basically you were right there.
Is it the facade of the echo?
Right.</v>

834
00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:29.140
Basically what,
what's going for there?
That's so funny.
Yeah.
But I think as you,

835
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:32.060
you've got a genuine call man.
And the fact that you keep getting them,

836
00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:35.420
that's the best kind that mean she's totally,
it's older.

837
00:55:35.421 --> 00:55:40.250
It sounds to me it's all people who aren't clued in that the voicemail is not

838
00:55:40.251 --> 00:55:44.900
their friends' phone numbers change.
Yeah.
It's not for you.
Yeah.
Um hmm.

839
00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:49.340
Yeah,
the Persian I cute.
I still got the other one I'm thinking of.

840
00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:50.443
<v 1>MMM.</v>

841
00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:55.963
MMM.

842
00:55:56.050 --> 00:55:59.220
<v 3>Languages.
We have a little bit of a debate going on here,
right?
Yeah.</v>

843
00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:02.410
Can I tell you about the dump I took this morning though?
Oh,
that'd be great.

844
00:56:02.411 --> 00:56:05.980
But I feel like I didn't,
I haven't talked to you about this yet today.

845
00:56:05.981 --> 00:56:09.220
We've been so busy.
But you know when you go to shit and you're like,

846
00:56:09.221 --> 00:56:12.790
this is just going to be a run of the mill dump and then you look in the bowl

847
00:56:12.791 --> 00:56:17.410
and you're like,
that's like a foot long.
Yeah.
That's what happened.
Wow.

848
00:56:17.411 --> 00:56:20.950
That's neat.
Yeah.
Yeah,
but it's,

849
00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:25.900
I didn't feel that long coming out and didn't feel like it would be that nice.

850
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:30.670
Yeah.
Yeah.
How many shifts have you taken today?
One really one.

851
00:56:30.671 --> 00:56:32.860
And it's one 15 wow.

852
00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:37.390
Some kind of record for Mr. I've got a problem.
Go too much.

853
00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:42.700
You do this thing that's so unfair.
No matter when I'm taking a shit.

854
00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:44.230
You Go.
Do you ever,

855
00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:48.370
are you ever not shitting cause you always choose to take a shit when we're

856
00:56:48.371 --> 00:56:51.520
doing something together as a family.
Like,
oh,
we're putting our son to sleep.

857
00:56:51.521 --> 00:56:55.870
I got to shit or we're having a nice moment with people.
I got to go shit.

858
00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:59.920
Or she called them.
We've got a shit as an excuse to get away from it.

859
00:56:59.921 --> 00:57:02.380
I'm not using it.
I have to go.
Yeah.
Okay.

860
00:57:03.730 --> 00:57:08.730
<v 1>L'Aquila is a lacroix and we had this kind of the island of,</v>

861
00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:13.020
yeah,
right.
Saint Croix.

862
00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:20.250
Now it's Lacroix.

863
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:21.530
<v 13>Okay,</v>

864
00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:24.030
<v 3>let's call him.
Let's call him right now.
Look</v>

865
00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:29.530
how to pronounce.
That's look cry.
What do you mean?

866
00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:36.140
<v 1>There's a,
let's see,
there's another,
like another video here.</v>

867
00:57:37.550 --> 00:57:40.610
Now in the same,

868
00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:44.330
the same type of post says

869
00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:48.490
from the company says Lacroix.
Right?

870
00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:53.690
But how do you pronounce the word?
I don't know.
I mean,

871
00:57:53.691 --> 00:57:56.120
they're saying Lacroix,

872
00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:01.820
the company's saying Lacroix.
That's saying [inaudible].
Right.

873
00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:06.260
So we're kind of,
I got emails from,

874
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:11.180
from listeners,
uh,
some of our French Canadian listeners saying,
Tommy's right,

875
00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:14.300
Nicola,
but then you're sticking to,

876
00:58:14.970 --> 00:58:18.570
<v 3>well,
the fucking official pronunciation on their website is lacroix.</v>

877
00:58:18.830 --> 00:58:23.580
But then how could that be?
It says,
Lacroix rhymes with enjoy.
Right?

878
00:58:23.730 --> 00:58:24.690
So maybe that's there.

879
00:58:24.691 --> 00:58:28.050
Maybe there's an accent that we're not looking at an accent mark or something or

880
00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:34.690
fee for some loud,
I don't fucking know.
I mean,

881
00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:38.520
can we call them right now?
You want to try to call him?
Yeah.
Okay.

882
00:58:38.610 --> 00:58:39.540
Let me see here.

883
00:58:40.610 --> 00:58:41.443
<v 13>MMM.</v>

884
00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:45.860
<v 1>Well we could end up getting into like a real debate with them though,
right?</v>

885
00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:50.870
I mean,
you feel like that's something you want to do right now?
Yeah.
Okay.

886
00:58:51.530 --> 00:58:54.950
Let me see here.
Um,

887
00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:58.110
how do you propose that we do,

888
00:58:58.410 --> 00:59:02.000
do you think we should just call them out on what we're looking for?

889
00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:06.860
I have also some other questions.
Really.

I want it to lie.
Why?</v>

894
00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:24.850
<v 13>Why does it make you burp so much?
Okay.</v>

I mean,

946
01:02:57.151 --> 01:02:58.180
or what I'm saying or

947

Who's the macho bravado smelling the cameras.

950
01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:13.773
The goods.

951

Yeah.

953
01:03:18.671 --> 01:03:20.440
you understand the start and then he was just smelling.

954
01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:21.970

959
01:03:36.310 --> 01:03:38.330
And the worst ones is the Niggas from the ghetto.

960
01:03:38.331 --> 01:03:41.150
That was pussy when they came up and when they got a little bit of money,

961
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:43.760
they all of a sudden turn hard rock.
You understand?

962
01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:47.820
<v 5>You understand?
First of all,
I do feel what he's saying and everything,</v>

963
01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:51.150
but at the chain,
he's got a different chain than the one you have.
Yeah,

964
01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:54.180
<v 1>I have that.
The old school Dukey road,
but yeah,</v>

965
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:56.220
he's got totally something else there.

966
01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:57.720
<v 5>Are you going to be getting earrings too?</v>

967
01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:01.410
<v 15>It ain't no way to prevent it that she can go on and they get a spelling bee.</v>

968
01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:04.460
It's like Niggas that come up in the road and you get pumped on in life and in

969
01:04:04.461 --> 01:04:08.520
turn it to a cup and they start Punkin Niggas and you like,

you must've been a faggy when you came up.
Wow.

971
01:04:12.030 --> 01:04:15.890

974
01:04:22.410 --> 01:04:26.670

Yeah,
he's definitely calling out Ricky rozay right there.
Right.

975
01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:30.530
And that's what Niggas in a game like these niggas been fag coming up any of the

976
01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:32.760

979
01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:44.970

Niggas know me.
Don't know me.

986
01:05:05.631 --> 01:05:08.000
This guy has taken the game to a whole other level.

987
01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.330
We have to open up a whole new category.

Yeah.
I don't do that.

1048
01:09:08.650 --> 01:09:12.850
I don't believe,
I think it's child abuse.
Really?
It's Saint Patrick's day dry.

1049
01:09:12.851 --> 01:09:16.300
Your two month old up in green things like he doesn't know where the fuck he is.

1050
01:09:16.301 --> 01:09:17.600
He doesn't know what Saint Patrick's Day.

1051
01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:22.450
Not for a while and now when they're babies.
Right.
No stupid.

1052
01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:27.360
It's for you.
It's for you to dress up your child long time.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1053
01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:30.030
That's true for a long time.
And Yeah.

1054
01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:34.680
You remember last week I had the lady lifting ways,
right?

1055
01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.273
<v 17>Hmm.</v>

1056
01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:45.550
<v 3>So I got another lady screaming,</v>

1057
01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:47.890
but she's getting a tattoo.

1058
01:09:49.090 --> 01:09:49.923
<v 6>Oh,

1059
01:09:50.110 --> 01:09:50.943
<v 17>Hi.</v>

1060
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.840
All

1061
01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:14.933
Chile.

1062
01:10:15.970 --> 01:10:19.990
<v 3>Look how calm he gets mad.
He gets mad eventually.
Super Unprofessional.
Yeah.</v>

1063
01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:24.700
<v 17>Yeah.
That's the problem.
It's killing me.</v>

1064
01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:35.310
<v 3>I should.
Or whites.
Yeah.
That's so great.</v>

1065
01:10:40.530 --> 01:10:41.363
<v 6>This lady.</v>

1066
01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:50.790
Okay.

1067
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:52.650
<v 3>Oh,

1068
01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.740
<v 17>Okay.
Yeah.</v>

1069
01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:04.000
<v 3>I like,
it's right after I said I need you to like calm down so I can do this.</v>

1070
01:11:04.290 --> 01:11:08.220
That's why you don't get tattoos drunk.
Right.
Cause it's way worser.

1071
01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:11.750
Shit got way worse.
You don't want him to know.

1072
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:15.520
What are you going to some tattoos,
you know,
I've been wondering.
Um,

1073
01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:19.380
I've actually been offered by a lot of people for free.
One,
two artists.

1074
01:11:19.890 --> 01:11:20.491
I don't know.

1075
01:11:20.491 --> 01:11:25.491
I probably would do something to start like a neck thing or I think I see you

1076
01:11:25.741 --> 01:11:28.270
like an old English chest piece.
Hmm.

1077
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:30.840
Your son's name on it and my name on it.

1078
01:11:31.050 --> 01:11:31.883
<v 13>Oh yeah.</v>

1079
01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:36.690
What do you think you would think chest is the way to go?
Huh?

1080
01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:41.490
<v 3>Do you want to start off small or knuckle?
I,
you know,</v>

1081
01:11:41.491 --> 01:11:42.510
I'm a huge fan of these.

1082
01:11:42.511 --> 01:11:44.680
I think these are the job stoppers are the fucking doing.

1083
01:11:44.690 --> 01:11:47.580
Maybe upper arms should be the first step.
I don't know.

1084
01:11:47.581 --> 01:11:50.640
Can I tell you lately and this is real,
real tog yeah,
I've been,

1085
01:11:50.730 --> 01:11:54.990
I like how it looks on a woman on the inner,
what does this reform?
Yeah.

1086
01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:58.710
I kind of like,
I want like an anchor really.
Really?

1087
01:11:58.711 --> 01:12:01.470
I kind of do or like a fisherman spear.
I don't know,

1088
01:12:01.471 --> 01:12:05.850
are tried and I don't know why I like that.
Go for it man.

1089
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:09.930
Or maybe just some spider webs on my elbow.
There you go.
That's more,

1090
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:13.620
I see that more for you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Or something on my boobs.

1091
01:12:13.621 --> 01:12:18.140
So when I feed my son,
he can do,
you should put see tigers pause.

1092
01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:19.740
<v 13>Okay.</v>

1093
01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:23.820
<v 3>That's classy.
Like on your chest.
Yeah.
Like what's her name?</v>

1094
01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:26.550
Not Rihanna was eve.
Eve has,
yeah.

1095
01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:29.330
And I would do like a series of them were like,

1096
01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:34.520
there's pause down from your chest all the way down your abdomen and then right

1097
01:12:35.671 --> 01:12:37.620
above your coach there's a bunch of spilled milk.

1098
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:42.590
<v 13>Okay.
That's,
that's where the kid is going to feed.</v>

1099
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:44.803
You know,

1100
01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:50.010
<v 3>I've got one for Ya.
Okay.
I think we should do one in all my i's a vive,</v>

1101
01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:54.030
not Betsy top prints.
[inaudible] prints pub.
Right.
Same thing.

1102
01:12:54.031 --> 01:12:59.030
Same breathing down your chest.
Oh,
that big pile of shit.
Um,

1103
01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:00.310
I in your butthole.

1104
01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:06.390
A pile of shit or my butthole swirl.
Okay.
Okay.

1105
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:10.260
I'm,
I'm,
I'm digging it.
I just an Arrow to your mouth.

1106
01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:14.410
<v 13>Dick's go here.
That's pretty,</v>

1107
01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:18.130
that's pretty not true.
We can put Dick's had been here on your face.

1108
01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:22.380
<v 3>Yeah.
No,
I'm serious.
Would you still love me if I got the job stoppers?
No.</v>

1109
01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:26.730
Fuck you money.
No,
I think I want to get that.
I would not know.

1110
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:29.800
Do you think Ellis with mine and it was mommy took him to school now they want

1111
01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:30.690
with knuckle dads.

1112
01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.840
I think the worst part of getting fuck you money on your notes would be that you

1113
01:13:33.841 --> 01:13:38.190
don't have it,
so that's why,
but no one knows that.

1114
01:13:38.191 --> 01:13:41.940
They'll just think I do.
Yeah,
I know.
I'd rather,
I'd rather wait.
How about this?

1115
01:13:41.941 --> 01:13:45.270
We'll make a deal.
We get like a nine figure net worth.

1116
01:13:45.271 --> 01:13:50.250
One day we can go get that tattooed on your,
on your knuckles.
I can't wait.

1117
01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:51.900
Yeah,
I think it's probably a couple of years away.

1118
01:13:52.230 --> 01:13:54.020
Are you serious that you really would have,

1119
01:13:54.021 --> 01:13:57.060
would you ever consider a tattoo for real though?
Yeah,
I would consider a tattoo.

1120
01:13:57.210 --> 01:13:59.880
Really?
Yeah.
You want to go get sun?
No,
I just,

1121
01:13:59.881 --> 01:14:02.780
because it would have to be one that that I want to get.
Yeah,

1122
01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:06.150
like a portrait of someone.
Yeah,
portrait would be good.

1123
01:14:09.090 --> 01:14:12.280
Yeah.
I'm kind of a portrait portrait of me.
On your face.
On your,

1124
01:14:13.890 --> 01:14:14.723
by your kid.

1125
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:16.103
<v 13>No,</v>

1126
01:14:16.770 --> 01:14:20.550
<v 3>I don't dig those.
How about a rapper,
Eric B and Rakim?
Yeah.</v>

1127
01:14:20.610 --> 01:14:23.160
I'll get Eric B and Rakim tattooed on me.
Sure,
no problem.

1128
01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:25.513
<v 13>Yeah.</v>

1129
01:14:25.770 --> 01:14:29.040
<v 3>Well,
it means a lot to you.
I might get like dad mouth tet tattooed on me.</v>

1130
01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:32.670
That means a lot to you.
Immortalized on your body is forever.

1131
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.650
Did I started my DJ career with a tattoo?
Yeah.
Well,
I mean,

1132
01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:39.810
I know what you should get since you're a comedian.

1133
01:14:40.050 --> 01:14:45.050
Microphone or the microphone cord wrapped all the way through those theater

1134
01:14:45.151 --> 01:14:48.840
faces.
The happy,
sad.
Yeah.

1135
01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:54.720
Or I'll put smile.
Why don't you always write that on myself?
Smile.
Why don't Ya.

1136
01:14:54.930 --> 01:14:57.990
Yeah.
I love making people laugh.
How about smile now?
Cry Later.

1137
01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:01.960
It's my now cry later.
I like that one a lot.
Yeah.
But that's kind of like AASC.

1138
01:15:02.050 --> 01:15:06.120
Hey homie.
Shit.
Old smile now.
Cry Later.
Locked up homes.

1139
01:15:06.570 --> 01:15:10.110
That's total present tattoo.
Yeah.
That's why it's funny,
you know?
Yeah.

1140
01:15:10.111 --> 01:15:13.750
You got to cry when it's time to cry.
Am I was 13 yeah.

1141
01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:15.480
Miss 13 that's cool.

1142
01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:17.453
<v 13>Mmm</v>

1143
01:15:18.530 --> 01:15:23.360
<v 3>God,
I'm still kind of riding that high of a DJ.
Be Crazy.</v>

1144
01:15:23.361 --> 01:15:27.620
Look Shit.
I know.
I can feel it.
There's so much brewing in the air.
Yeah.

1145
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:30.560
Possibilities,
potentials,
potentiality.

1146
01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:37.130
Oh God.
This is a juggle it.
Beauty pageant.

1147
01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.233
<v 13>Okay.</v>

1148
01:15:41.010 --> 01:15:44.670
<v 3>Yeah.
I just wanted to make sure that phase covers the whole screen.
All right.</v>

1149
01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:47.413
<v 13>Ooh.</v>

1150
01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:52.070
<v 18>A lot of people think Joe lots are just like,
they're just these big horse.</v>

1151
01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:54.903
<v 13>No.</v>

1152
01:15:56.010 --> 01:15:58.860
<v 18>When I go to the gathering and shows and other girls,</v>

1153
01:15:58.861 --> 01:16:02.130
we can just sit and be girls.
You're not preppy.

1154
01:16:02.131 --> 01:16:03.660
You're not going to judge me for anything.

1155
01:16:03.661 --> 01:16:07.800
Like we can sit down and have a one on one alone conversation and relate to so

1156
01:16:07.801 --> 01:16:11.550
many things in so many ways that not any other people can really relate to.

1157
01:16:12.930 --> 01:16:15.780
<v 13>Oof.
If I was a judge</v>

1158
01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:18.730
<v 3>and those were the first few people that came up on the contest,</v>

1159
01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:22.160
my score would be
both,

1160
01:16:22.230 --> 01:16:27.230
but can I tell you how much would you love it if one of these broads showed up

1161
01:16:27.251 --> 01:16:30.280
at a legitimate beauty contest?
That's true.
That would be it.

1162
01:16:30.281 --> 01:16:32.590
Then I started watching Miss America all over again.

1163
01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:37.120
One of these Lumitex showed up.
Can we do that?

1164
01:16:37.121 --> 01:16:39.730
Can we subvert a beauty pageant like that?
Yeah.
I mean like,

1165
01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:44.440
I guess that's kind of what they're doing.
Yeah.
So that's sort of the,

1166
01:16:44.441 --> 01:16:49.440
uh,
the,
you know,
my point of it.
Yeah.
I like it.
All right.

1167
01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:53.960
That's cool.
But still score well.
All right.

1168
01:16:55.570 --> 01:16:59.560
Why is that not such a dad thing?
Oof.
Huh.

1169
01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:02.623
<v 13>Now do it.</v>

1170
01:17:02.970 --> 01:17:06.180
<v 3>What do you think your dad would say about these ladies?
I'd be really upset.</v>

1171
01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:10.190
Is this your first gathering?
And my dad does your,
your first beauty contest.

1172
01:17:10.930 --> 01:17:15.410
<v 8>I won 2009.
I need a microphone disappear.
Where?</v>

1173
01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:19.550
In the front?
In the bag?

1174
01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:25.620
<v 3>Yeah.
Wow.
So she put it up on a microphone or coach?
Yeah.
That's pretty cool.</v>

1175
01:17:25.621 --> 01:17:28.530
Actually.
I'm a bigger fan now.
I respect that.

1176
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:31.300
My Dad would be really upset by this too.
Oh,

1177
01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:35.970
I should this woman I saw ugly God.
Fuck,
fuck in the flood.

1178
01:17:36.370 --> 01:17:38.250
Look good.
These pigs.
Oh my.
Um,

1179
01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:42.030
well my father has no tolerance for unattractive women.
Yeah.

1180
01:17:42.330 --> 01:17:47.100
Disdain for unattractive people.
Like how dare you be ugly fat too,
right?

1181
01:17:47.130 --> 01:17:51.720
Oh,
fatness is inexcusable.
Yeah.
He always makes jokes about me.

1182
01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:55.020
He's like,
does he?
Well,
he's always like,
oh,
see you lost some weight.

1183
01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:57.190
And I was like,
Oh yeah.
He's like,
no,

1184
01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:04.630
this is a miss cyanide here.
Talking about her.
Uh,

1185
01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:06.780
<v 8>our journey started with you sideline.</v>

1186
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:10.510
The juggle that rapper who lives in our home studio with her boyfriend's

1187
01:18:10.530 --> 01:18:14.650
sidekick.
Okay.

1188
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:20.450
<v 17>Pig Feed saw.
Can't break me down.
I bet they're going,</v>

1189
01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:24.630
I hate me now.
There's no safety now.

1190
01:18:25.630 --> 01:18:28.270
<v 3>So,
so far I'll say,</v>

1191
01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:33.640
I'd rather watch her compete in the beauty part.

1192
01:18:34.330 --> 01:18:39.330
Then the rapping part point taken now in the concert is between Nick Hark,

1193
01:18:40.690 --> 01:18:44.950
the guy from the real plastic surgeon in Beverly hills or DJ poor grind,

1194
01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:49.330
whatever her name is,
Miss Cyanide,
ms cyanide,
which of these concerts now listen,

1195
01:18:49.331 --> 01:18:51.280
you gotta go?
Yeah,
go watch the whole show.

1196
01:18:51.850 --> 01:18:54.490
So we have Nick Hawk doing his repartee wraps.

1197
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:59.170
We have the Beverly hills plastic surgeon who like I dedicated.

1198
01:18:59.171 --> 01:19:01.870
A lot of times when you're in surgery,
you need something to go wrong.

1199
01:19:02.430 --> 01:19:06.760
Otherwise what are you there to fix?
Okay.
That guy.
And he's like,
okay,
he's last.

1200
01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:10.030
Right.
I just,
I just decided this last,
I think he's last.

1201
01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:13.960
I think it's the hardest one because here's why it's bad,

1202
01:19:13.961 --> 01:19:18.070
but it's bad in something that I,
that wouldn't necessarily,

1203
01:19:18.071 --> 01:19:21.430
like if it was good,
you know,
it's not even your John.
Right,
right.

1204
01:19:21.431 --> 01:19:26.431
So just so I feel like I could have a lot more laughs and a lot more fun even

1205
01:19:27.101 --> 01:19:30.250
with it being bad at nick.
I know that,
you know,

1206
01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:33.240
that's a problem is that there's so much more to laugh at at nick.

1207
01:19:33.370 --> 01:19:35.980
The nick hoc show.
Yeah.
Cause he's gonna be,
you know,

1208
01:19:35.981 --> 01:19:40.000
posturing real sincere Yang and yeah.
Yeah,

1209
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:44.020
yeah,
yeah.
Ms Cyanide is just kind of sloppy and all over the place.
Yeah.

1210
01:19:44.110 --> 01:19:48.670
What I've seen so far,
she's a little more Polish.
Yeah.
One more time.

1211
01:19:48.810 --> 01:19:52.410
<v 17>Take me down.
I'm,
that's your play in this song now.</v>

1212
01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:56.660
<v 8>It was rad.</v>

1213
01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:01.790
<v 3>Yeah.
About haters and the shit that you deal with people because I'm,</v>

1214
01:20:01.791 --> 01:20:04.040
I'm up here,
I'm feeling great.
I'm on top of it.

1215
01:20:04.041 --> 01:20:06.040
I'm doing what you said I couldn't do.
Yeah.

1216
01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:09.960
Cyanide is a and the juggle at BD pageant that's held on the last day of the

1217
01:20:09.961 --> 01:20:14.940
gathering every year.
Alright.
Oh,
I liked this.
I like the cyanide going for it.

1218
01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:18.940
I did too.
And I will say of all three at least,

1219
01:20:18.941 --> 01:20:23.941
she's really kind of in it like she's genuinely one thing more than at this than

1220
01:20:25.051 --> 01:20:28.770
I do at traditional beauty pageants is that they're really doing,

1221
01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:32.040
this is obviously the talent portion so far.

1222
01:20:32.041 --> 01:20:35.940
We know that one of them raps and one of them shoved them Mike up or coach.

1223
01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:39.960
And I would rather see that at Miss America than that bullshit when they're

1224
01:20:39.961 --> 01:20:43.930
looking at head fucking and I flipped this in the air and then I catch it might

1225
01:20:43.950 --> 01:20:47.510
not be the best if they're like,
I can hide this in my pussy.
Yeah,

1226
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:52.620
that's Ms Iowa.
Yeah,
that'd be great.
Yeah.
The,

1227
01:20:52.690 --> 01:20:56.670
I understand it's to subvert beauty pageants then why have a beauty pageant at

1228
01:20:56.671 --> 01:20:57.000
all?

1229
01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.720
Like when not be the ultimate subversion is to just not have a beauty pageant.

1230
01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:01.411
Well,
no,

1231
01:21:01.411 --> 01:21:06.300
because I think in this case what they're saying is those beauty pageants are so

1232
01:21:06.301 --> 01:21:10.020
misguided and,
and their interpretation of beauty.

1233
01:21:10.410 --> 01:21:15.410
So one dimensional that we're going to bring women to the table that aren't

1234
01:21:16.230 --> 01:21:17.700
traditionally beautiful.
Right.

1235
01:21:17.701 --> 01:21:21.420
And the one who shoves a microphone up or pussy is the fucking best.

1236
01:21:21.421 --> 01:21:25.310
Clearly not where the wrapper and their talents.
So that's kind of cool.

1237
01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:31.200
<v 18>Last year sign I participated for the first time she kind of blew it,</v>

1238
01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:36.180
but she's been practicing law

1239
01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:39.990
<v 3>summer to get back on stage of it.
For her I was really nervous and I got really,</v>

1240
01:21:39.991 --> 01:21:41.100
really fucking high.

1241
01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:43.680
Like before I was like I got smoke a bowl and my brain was like,

1242
01:21:43.710 --> 01:21:47.580
oh fuck you forgot the rest of your lyrics.
I like her,
hey,

1243
01:21:47.581 --> 01:21:49.440
you know why she saw her mistake?

1244
01:21:49.441 --> 01:21:51.960
She knew how to correct it and she's going to move on.

1245
01:21:51.961 --> 01:21:54.240
Actually the thing I respect the most is that she went back.

1246
01:21:54.330 --> 01:21:58.110
That's good for dude.
That's tough.
Huge fan of cyanide already.

1247
01:21:58.111 --> 01:22:01.620
I wouldn't want to watch wraps that long.
Has um,

1248
01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:07.470
has fucken as a comedian forgotten the line for sure.

1249
01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:10.830
Panic inducing.
It's the worse.
That's why I don't do drugs.

1250
01:22:10.831 --> 01:22:12.750
I can't even really drink coffee before shows.

1251
01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:15.270
I don't like to do anything before it either.
Do it straight

1252
01:22:16.450 --> 01:22:17.111
<v 18>cyanide pack,</v>

1253
01:22:17.111 --> 01:22:20.890
300 Jello shots and most of the belongings in our home before setting off

1254
01:22:21.090 --> 01:22:24.060
<v 3>someone might not have a good second year at this maybe,</v>

1255
01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:28.450
<v 18>which she in fact had had been saving up for all year.
Oh Man.</v>

1256
01:22:28.450 --> 01:22:33.010
<v 3>This is like their whole life.
No,
they love it.
She spending it on Jello shots.</v>

1257
01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:35.860
Good for them.
Gassing up the van,

1258
01:22:36.450 --> 01:22:39.080
back kid and I are going to go rip it a wrap.

1259
01:22:40.030 --> 01:22:44.490
All right man.
I'm actually really into this now.
Yeah.
Um,

1260
01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.920
I like this look.
Actually I'm being serious.
I like a ball hog.

1261
01:22:47.921 --> 01:22:49.570
I've always liked him.
All you have always like,

1262
01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:52.860
are you going to do it to our son now you don't like it when Peter wrote the

1263
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:54.250
kids,
can I tell you something?

1264
01:22:54.251 --> 01:22:59.140
I don't like to inflict my personal style on a kid.
It's like it.

1265
01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:03.850
Unless he asks for it.
It's not my place.
I know I like the Ramones is my kid.

1266
01:23:03.851 --> 01:23:08.110
I have to like the Ramones.
He's not an extension of me.
He's his own little dude.

1267
01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:13.990
Do I want to put clash shirts on my kid?
Yeah,
but I won't.
It's his fucking,

1268
01:23:14.230 --> 01:23:17.710
he's a person I don't like when people do that.

1269
01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:19.780
Fuck this always happens to me.

1270
01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:25.780
You don't like doing that at all,
right?
It's just not fair.

1271
01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:30.570
It's like he didn't ask to be a fan of the shit that I like.
Yeah.

1272
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:34.420
Here we go.
We have an after party with Dj Clay,

1273
01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:38.310
which is gonna be quite the same.
Holy Shit.
That just

1274
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.330
more like we can do a lot of really ratchet stuff about getting in trouble.
Yes,

1275
01:23:44.410 --> 01:23:48.210
exactly.
Gears.
Awesome.
That'll be here.
And what about that too?

1276
01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:51.700
What about that is my first,
this is what I'm talking about now.

1277
01:23:51.701 --> 01:23:55.660
I didn't realize that these were just like soggy underwear that he's wearing.

1278
01:23:55.930 --> 01:24:00.930
I thought this was an actual short and not so much into the front of the outfit.

1279
01:24:01.991 --> 01:24:04.810
I'm into the back of it though.
But what about this part of the front?

1280
01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:09.130
I like that.
I like that.
I like what it stands for.
A dues red.
Huh?
Super.

1281
01:24:09.650 --> 01:24:13.360
It's a lot of crazy tattoos here.
Is this a grenade on his hand?

1282
01:24:14.370 --> 01:24:19.210
I liked her.
She is just like,
Hey,
what's up?
She's like,
yeah,
this is normal.

1283
01:24:19.211 --> 01:24:24.040
He's like,
this is how I roll.
Well,
Gigi Allen,
look,
little shout out.

1284
01:24:24.041 --> 01:24:26.100
He's wearing the same GG.

1285
01:24:26.190 --> 01:24:31.030
If you combine the girls clip from earlier about eating ass,
you look at this.

1286
01:24:31.570 --> 01:24:34.390
I feel like a lot of what she said would come true in here.

1287
01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:36.550
It wouldn't smell great.

1288
01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:41.170
Wouldn't taste the best,

1289
01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:46.920
but overall not that bad.
Not that bad.
Yeah.
What do you think?

1290
01:24:46.921 --> 01:24:50.500
And I was better than it used to.
I think this guy has got the worst ass.

1291
01:24:50.501 --> 01:24:55.030
If anybody in the world.
No,
but bad because bad.

1292
01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:58.180
What'd you eat?
His ass.
No,
I would not,

1293
01:24:58.690 --> 01:25:00.280
but I don't think it would smell good either.

1294
01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:06.780
Let's jump ahead to Miss Miss Sinai's performance.

1295
01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:10.960
I want to see.
Yeah.
Does she redeem herself this year?
Well here,

1296
01:25:10.961 --> 01:25:14.410
this is bright before she goes up.
I think right here.
Poor girl.

1297
01:25:14.590 --> 01:25:16.870
I hope she's been practicing in front of audiences.
That's the key.

1298
01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:23.330
<v 8>There's a lot more people out there.
Then last year when I did this,
I was like,</v>

1299
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:25.303
wow,

1300
01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:30.370
<v 3>you can do it.
She's nervous.
Come on,
Batman.
Come on.
Come on home girl.
Um,</v>

1301
01:25:30.430 --> 01:25:35.220
so this is a clip here where,
let's see.
There's some good,
all right.

1302
01:25:35.230 --> 01:25:36.340
There's goods and contestants.

1303
01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:42.100
Or is this a drawing that looks like a tattoo baby boy,
baby.

1304
01:25:42.130 --> 01:25:45.600
Here she goes.
I got one.
I'm so invested in Ms Cyanide now.
Yeah.

1305
01:25:45.730 --> 01:25:46.563
I want to know she

1306
01:25:58.550 --> 01:26:01.500
<v 8>[inaudible].</v>

1307
01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:17.993
<v 17>Okay,</v>

1308
01:26:23.490 --> 01:26:24.890
<v 1>I'll tell you this already.
I like it.</v>

1309
01:26:25.410 --> 01:26:29.340
Her live performance is better than her booth performance.

1310
01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:31.380
You know when the one that she did at home

1311
01:26:31.850 --> 01:26:35.210
<v 5>had a fraction of this energy?
Well,
she's feeling it.
She's the,</v>

1312
01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:38.600
she's fucking on it.
I think she's,
she's killing me.

1313
01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:42.560
<v 17>Yeah.
Whoa.</v>

1314
01:26:46.050 --> 01:26:47.340
My feeling is that

1315
01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:52.573
awesome.

1316
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.060
<v 1>So she's,
she's feeling good about herself right now.</v>

1317
01:26:56.540 --> 01:27:01.070
Here's what you've been waiting for.
Jeans,
the,
uh,
the results.
So you ready?

1318
01:27:01.490 --> 01:27:04.700
We have the results.
Do you think how you think she did?
Yeah,

1319
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:06.200
<v 5>I'd say she killed it.</v>

1320
01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:10.070
But knowing that last year someone put a microphone up there,
Posey and won,

1321
01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:13.580
she's going to get beaten up by some dumb cunt that does something stupid.

1322
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:16.790
Just like everything in Showbiz.
Yeah.
Right.
Here we go.

1323
01:27:29.230 --> 01:27:30.063
<v 8>Testing.</v>

1324
01:27:36.150 --> 01:27:36.983
<v 17>What's her fucking,</v>

1325
01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:46.140
<v 1>I don't know what else she did.
What she did.
I don't know.
Well,</v>

1326
01:27:46.750 --> 01:27:48.550
so what ms up cyanide.

1327
01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:53.140
<v 5>I will,
I'll vote for you.
Good job.
We support you.
Well,
good for her.</v>

1328
01:27:53.141 --> 01:27:54.730
That's really hard to do now.

1329
01:27:54.731 --> 01:27:59.530
I thought the Juggalos were supposed to be nonjudgmental.
Ooh,

1330
01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:02.770
yeah,
yeah.
That about you're not supposed to boot people off stage.

1331
01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:04.700
<v 1>Um,
by the way,</v>

1332
01:28:04.701 --> 01:28:08.300
I ordered my DJ equipment through your mom's house podcasts that come right.

1333
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:12.430
And it was on banner.
I can see your eyes roll,
just so you know.
Yeah,

1334
01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:17.960
I got speakers.
I got,
uh,
I got the time.
Are we done the show?
Is it?
Yeah,

1335
01:28:17.961 --> 01:28:20.810
we got to get everything wrapped up already.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1336
01:28:20.890 --> 01:28:25.460
We got to get into this.
So last week we did a fill her up right.

1337
01:28:25.530 --> 01:28:29.060
Sealers,
song contest.
Right.
Here's what happened.

1338
01:28:29.210 --> 01:28:34.210
We have a tie to submissions have gotten the most amount of votes,

1339
01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:36.450
but then a wildcard,

1340
01:28:36.530 --> 01:28:40.730
late submission came in and blue band deemed it's so good and he said we have to

1341
01:28:40.731 --> 01:28:45.320
listen to it.
Okay,
so first I'll play you the first two.

1342
01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:48.050
Um,
the first two that,

1343
01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:51.800
that have the highest votes so far in the contest.
Okay.

1344
01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:56.583
<v 4>Hello.</v>

1345
01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:06.550
<v 3>Just us from John.
Love it.
This one from Holly.</v>

1346
01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:14.760
Clean too concise.

1347
01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.220
<v 2>Yolo.
Ready to do this shit man.</v>

1348
01:29:45.410 --> 01:29:46.243
Okay.

1349
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:52.150
<v 3>All right.
So that's by Ali also.
Great.
And then here's the,
uh,</v>

1350
01:29:52.151 --> 01:29:55.390
the late submission that,
uh,
I haven't even heard yet,

1351
01:29:55.540 --> 01:29:59.230
but I've heard is good from Rick.
Here we go.

1352
01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:03.820
<v 13>She's like a machine.
You just want to fill</v>

1353
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:06.520
holes with them anyway.

1354
01:30:14.090 --> 01:30:15.000
Really like twice.

1355
01:30:24.530 --> 01:30:27.050
I'll tell you what I did.
This was really great.

1356
01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:32.660
It also stuck to the Latin flavor of curry thing.

1357
01:30:32.690 --> 01:30:34.730
Pretty good man.
That's really good.

1358
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:43.690
Well,
might as well play around it.
Filler up sealer shy,

1359
01:30:43.691 --> 01:30:45.500
what do you say?
Yeah.
Okay.

1360
01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:48.920
So tell her up and steal her shot.

1361
01:30:49.190 --> 01:30:53.540
Presidential presidential edition.
The presidential nominee is issue,
right?

1362
01:30:53.630 --> 01:30:58.190
So we have Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders.

1363
01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:02.720
Yes.
For the men.
Right.
What are you thinking?
Yeah.

1364
01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:05.720
What do you thinking in terms of those two?

1365
01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:11.440
Because that's not exactly the most desirable filler up material as a lady.

1366
01:31:14.690 --> 01:31:17.570
What you know about it either.
That's why it's a good one.

1367
01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:21.580
<v 3>It's good when they're both really,</v>

1368
01:31:21.581 --> 01:31:25.120
really hot or both really,
really not.

1369
01:31:25.450 --> 01:31:28.450
The thing is okay.
Right,
okay.
Yeah.

1370
01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:33.280
Is that you want to separate the personality from the Sexual Act.

1371
01:31:33.490 --> 01:31:36.940
That's always the key to a successful fill her up.
Right.
Cause you don't,

1372
01:31:36.941 --> 01:31:40.420
you're not really talking about the person,
but you're letting the personality,

1373
01:31:40.421 --> 01:31:41.980
sexual side,

1374
01:31:42.340 --> 01:31:46.150
you're letting the personality dictate what the sexuality is in a way.
Right,

1375
01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:46.570
right.

1376
01:31:46.570 --> 01:31:51.550
I mean I kind of imagine it's obvious that Donald is a selfish megalomaniac,

1377
01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:55.070
narcissistic and sergeant historical.

1378
01:31:55.150 --> 01:31:56.920
It's going to be a horrible,
yeah,

1379
01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:02.760
but Bernie's so timid and such a Beta male that it might be just really

1380
01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:08.230
horrendous and he's old.
He just got into that.

1381
01:32:08.231 --> 01:32:12.790
I got to say that guy knows how to eat a box.
Bernie,
why'd he say that?

1382
01:32:12.791 --> 01:32:16.030
I could just see it.
I just feel like it's,
it's part of the foundation.

1383
01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:19.600
At his funeral there are going to talk about how he used to eat pussy like

1384
01:32:19.601 --> 01:32:21.310
nobody else.
I can feel it.

1385
01:32:21.430 --> 01:32:26.110
Know he was part of those civil rights marches and things.
I mean,

1386
01:32:26.111 --> 01:32:26.890
he's a giver.

1387
01:32:26.890 --> 01:32:31.040
You know a guy cares about the other man or in the case of in the bed,
you care.

1388
01:32:31.041 --> 01:32:33.850
He wants you to finish first.
That's what he's all about.

1389
01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:36.700
But I don't want it to last very long.

1390
01:32:36.701 --> 01:32:41.020
Like I kind of almost want the selfish lay here so that it's just over like

1391
01:32:41.021 --> 01:32:43.930
Trump,
just big arcs and then we'll get,
get the fuck outta here.

1392
01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:47.170
You know what I mean?
And will tell you to get the fuck out.
Right?
For sure.

1393
01:32:47.190 --> 01:32:51.880
Tell him good luck.
Good luck.

1394
01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:55.330
In that case.
I don't want this to be a drawn out because Bernie,

1395
01:32:55.660 --> 01:33:00.660
he's going to light the candles were talking sensible masage lavender smells to

1396
01:33:01.901 --> 01:33:05.470
question the hundred candle bath.
What's wrong with that?

1397
01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:10.720
I don't want it with Bernie
grain last.

1398
01:33:10.721 --> 01:33:14.740
He's a sexy mailman man.
Unless he got the mailman length.

1399
01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:18.400
I think conversation would be fascinating.
I think you'd have a nice,

1400
01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:21.190
I don't want that.
Okay.
Oh,
you just want to get yours off.

1401
01:33:21.250 --> 01:33:24.250
I just want to get in and get out of this ordeal.
No,

1402
01:33:24.251 --> 01:33:26.080
I want to get out of the filler up sealer shut.

1403
01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:28.720
I don't want to participate in this one.
Okay.

1404
01:33:28.721 --> 01:33:33.160
So I just want to get in and out quick and the Donald is going to be the easiest

1405
01:33:33.161 --> 01:33:37.420
way out.
Wow.
I got to tell you.
Real curve ball.
Didn't expect that answer.

1406
01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:42.460
Real.
What are you?
You're picking Bernie.
Oh,
massage.

1407
01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:46.360
First of all,
you know,
he would be like,
I'm not a gay man.

1408
01:33:46.361 --> 01:33:50.980
I know you're not a gay man,
but we both got to come.
So,

1409
01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:55.030
uh,
what do you need me to do your bowls?
And I'd be like,
Bernie,

1410
01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:59.470
just do what you would do to your own balls,
you know?
And I think he would be,

1411
01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:03.500
yeah,
I think,
I think it would be unbearable with,

1412
01:34:03.501 --> 01:34:08.200
with the done bearable.
But then again,
he's just like a frat boy as a man.

1413
01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:11.770
Choosing between those two.
I think it's much easier.

1414
01:34:11.771 --> 01:34:15.550
Maybe because I can't speak as a woman,
as a man,
you gotta go with Bernie.

1415
01:34:15.551 --> 01:34:19.530
He's going to be much more gentle,
much more caring.
He's still going to be like,

1416
01:34:19.531 --> 01:34:20.430
do you come to go?

1417
01:34:20.431 --> 01:34:24.250
And he'll be nice and there's more involved with but fucking them or as vaginal.

1418
01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:29.790
Donald's just going to come in drunk like a frat guy and just prison pound you

1419
01:34:30.101 --> 01:34:34.690
and it'll be done in 30 seconds and I'll throw a towel you and they'll be like,

1420
01:34:34.691 --> 01:34:39.100
great.
And sod gate.
Huge suck.

1421
01:34:39.390 --> 01:34:43.080
You gotta drink some of that milk.
Okay.

1422
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:48.610
And the next for the ladies.
So you and I are opposed on this issue,

1423
01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:51.370
this highway high ticket items are we?

1424
01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:56.830
And the next one is Hillary or the fear in her Nina.

1425
01:34:57.260 --> 01:34:59.570
Carly Fiorina.
Carla Lorela.
Lafonda Nina.

1426
01:34:59.730 --> 01:35:04.350
<v 1>For me it's easy.
Carly has that ice queen.</v>

1427
01:35:05.250 --> 01:35:10.200
Fucking almost like dominatrix lecturer from house of farts.

1428
01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:14.040
Yeah.
Ah,
I like Carly's style.

1429
01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:18.690
Meaning she's a meanie and like it,
it turns me on,
I feel like,

1430
01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:23.610
and she was the CEO,
I think of IBM.
So I'd be like,

1431
01:35:23.670 --> 01:35:25.870
what are out what our acquisitions and mergers lately.

1432
01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:31.110
Tell me about like the first IPO you where it should be like eat this from

1433
01:35:31.111 --> 01:35:34.920
behind.
You know,
we like her,
but that's more of a power bitch.
Yeah.

1434
01:35:34.921 --> 01:35:38.880
She was a total power bitch and um,
I could see myself being very excited by her.

1435
01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:42.250
<v 3>See,
I think Hillary is your classic closet.</v>

1436
01:35:42.251 --> 01:35:46.990
Lez She's definitely a lesson college.
Yeah.
And then she was like,

1437
01:35:46.991 --> 01:35:50.210
I can't be gay because I got,
I want this political life.
I got Mary,

1438
01:35:50.290 --> 01:35:55.090
I'll bill here.
Bill seems acceptable.
So I think Hillary is a varsity level.

1439
01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:59.200
Lez and if you want to go with that experience,

1440
01:35:59.290 --> 01:36:03.610
she's your girl.
She's got years of eating box experience.
I bet.

1441
01:36:03.730 --> 01:36:08.320
Wow.
See I think,
I feel like Carly would put cigarettes out on my mouth.
Yeah.

1442
01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:12.070
She wet and then she'd be like,
I gotta pee.
I'd be like,
okay,
I'll wait here.

1443
01:36:12.071 --> 01:36:15.990
And she'd be like,
no,
open up your mouth.
Okay.
I mean,
should piss out the ass.

1444
01:36:16.010 --> 01:36:20.070
She's alone more.
Yeah.
Domineering and whatnot.
I know,

1445
01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:22.390
I'm excited thinking about like it's actually going to happen.

1446
01:36:22.450 --> 01:36:26.590
I think Carly's over using Carly emceeing.
Carla.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1447
01:36:26.830 --> 01:36:31.480
But I feel like she's too,
yeah,
I dunno.
I don't want to power budge.

1448
01:36:31.540 --> 01:36:34.960
I can't deal with it really well cause I'm kind of an Alpha.

1449
01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:39.610
I think Hillary's more of like the seventies college list.
That's what you want.

1450
01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:44.410
<v 1>Yeah.
I like when I'm old Carly,
like here's,</v>

1451
01:36:44.710 --> 01:36:49.210
here's Carly.
I'm eating her butt.
And then she's looking back,

1452
01:36:49.211 --> 01:36:53.230
like you said,
all you got.
Right.
You see,
I mean,
it's just,

1453
01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:55.810
this is attractive.
Right,
right,
right.
I like her.

1454
01:36:56.620 --> 01:37:01.000
I know Trump made a horrific comment about,
no,
I feel like Douche bag.

1455
01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:03.340
I think between the two,
there's no context for me.

1456
01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:08.690
<v 3>I disagree.
I think aesthetically I like Hillary.
What's better?
I'm,</v>

1457
01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:12.270
I like blondes,
you know?
Yeah.
I'm partial to,

1458
01:37:12.271 --> 01:37:14.070
I'd never been out with a blonde before.
Really?

1459
01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:17.300
<v 1>Nope.
Um,
yeah.
This here,
right?</v>

1460
01:37:17.390 --> 01:37:20.630
<v 3>This is,
this is me.
This is her.
After I come look right,</v>

1461
01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:23.060
they come in those balls.
She was like,

1462
01:37:23.061 --> 01:37:28.040
you got any common those bulls and then I do.
And then she goes,
that's it.
No,

1463
01:37:28.041 --> 01:37:32.600
she insults the come load,
the amount of load.
You call that a load there.

1464
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:35.140
You call that a load.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1465
01:37:36.250 --> 01:37:40.730
[inaudible] look small.
Mm.
How many balls do you have?

1466
01:37:41.150 --> 01:37:45.950
Half of one.
Yeah.
Not impressed as fiar Nina.
I go,

1467
01:37:45.951 --> 01:37:48.590
where should I come?
And she goes right over here.

1468
01:37:51.050 --> 01:37:55.230
<v 1>Ah,
yeah.
Yep.
That would be it.
Yeah.
I like her.</v>

1469
01:37:55.610 --> 01:37:59.370
I choose her.
I can't believe you're choosing Hillary,
but it makes sense.
Well,

1470
01:37:59.371 --> 01:38:03.090
I know,
but you're right that maybe she has a lot of less experience.

1471
01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:06.900
<v 3>Countless.
I,
I,
I wouldn't be surprised that she really knows her.</v>

1472
01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:11.480
She knows all the tricks and she's from that era of like,
there's the protests,

1473
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:14.460
uh,
heroin,
Billy and yeah,
college.

1474
01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:19.370
She's got that classic Lez 60 seventies bless.

1475
01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:23.070
Like full Bush,
uh,
free love.
Lez Right.

1476
01:38:23.130 --> 01:38:27.510
That's the violent one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just like whatever man would you got?

1477
01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:30.870
I'll tell you get like,
just free love and Farley puts a leash on me.

1478
01:38:30.871 --> 01:38:33.700
She was like,
come on man.
It's a different energy altogether.

1479
01:38:34.010 --> 01:38:36.990
She's too dominant for me.
It's not going to work.

1480
01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:42.690
<v 1>We have a,
what's it sound to go out to?
There's a o,
m c.</v>

1481
01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:46.800
Oh,
see now I'm saying no.
Saying there's a challenge and then there's a disk.

1482
01:38:46.830 --> 01:38:50.220
Which one should I play?
The spark challenge as far as challenge.
Okay.
