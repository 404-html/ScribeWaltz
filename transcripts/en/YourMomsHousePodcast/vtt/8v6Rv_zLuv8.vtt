Christina

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.873
<v 3>speaking</v>

7
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.890
on 13 size tax,

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.200
Dining common.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.040
<v 1>Yeah.
You like,
I'm circumcise guys.</v>

10
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.310
<v 0>Geez.
It's like when you,
I recall,</v>

11
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.030
right?
Like he's at a restaurant and the waiter remembers him from last time.

12
00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:48.690
It's exactly what it is.
Yeah.

13
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.420
You like the Chateau Neuf as I recall,
as I recall.
Right.

14
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.560
You like that.
Uh,
uh,
and Endesa is,

15
00:01:57.561 --> 00:02:02.561
I recall my head with the Cabernet as I recall.

16
00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:07.400
If I looked back and a recall,
where's the county?
You know,

17
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.230
here's the guy.
Yeah.
You like uncircumcised guys as,
as I recall,
right?

18
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.960
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

19
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.390
yeah.
It's so fucking gross is that's a,
that's a male prostitute,

20
00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:26.000
right?
Yeah.
That's the thing.
He's trying to get that money out of this guy.

21
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.150
So you got any common,
those bulls,

22
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.250
that's a different approach than the male to female prostitute.

23
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.510
Like how guys would be women if women would a yeah,

24
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.360
this is 100% how we will talk to you all the time.
Okay.

25
00:02:43.361 --> 00:02:44.740
Walk me through court ship.

26
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.190
If you could just say the stuff he really wanted to say like,
okay,

27
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.660
it's 2005 you and I are at the cat club and we're meeting for the first time.
Go.

28
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.870
Yeah.
I'd be like,
ah man,
I'm trying to nut right.

29
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.260
You mind if I do it all over you or you want to help?
We want to get involved.

30
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.300
Hurry,
touch it.
Yeah.
Put your hand on it and there's your mouth.

31
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.220
Give it to me.
Touch it.
And then what'd you grab my hand?
Come on.

32
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.990
He'd make it happen.
Right?
Like I'm hungry now.
You want to eat something
then?

33
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.580
Yeah,
it'd be like if it,
it would be the way that like two best friends,

34
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.760
like two guys that are Hetero,
that are best friends talk.

35
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.170
That's how it would be if a,
yeah.
So I would just be like,
oh,
that was fun.

36
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.300
Uh,
I don't play video games now.
You want to watch the game?

37
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.470
Uh,
yeah.
Let's get some food.
Do you want to fuck again?

38
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.420
That was what you want to fuck again,
like no social pretense because the yeah,

39
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.850
wouldn't be the dance.
Yeah,

40
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.010
the woman does the romance dance and like the play of,
I just be like,

41
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:48.844
it feels good.

42
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.110
You mean the actual court ship and the civility,

43
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.580
all that nonsense and be gone and you could actually get down to the real deal,

44
00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:01.120
which is like,
it's hard again.
Can you work it out?
Yeah.

45
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.140
I like how you consider the woman's side of it.
Just like frivolous nonsense.

46
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.440
It is frivolous nonsense to know the other person the worst.

47
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.540
It's the part that every guy dreads because we just want it to be like,

48
00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:18.541
can we just stop with this bullshit talking and getting Taco and then like,

49
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.150
you know,
oh you know,
or you want to make sure I showered,

50
00:04:24.151 --> 00:04:27.760
like all this stupid shit and then you have to act like,
you know,

51
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:29.290
we're working our way through the steps.

52
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.020
We just want it to be anal and done getting it in.

53
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.400
Well that's why a lot of men say that other guys are creeps right.
Like,

54
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:40.060
why manner hate other guys.
I don't know.
Guys are such a scumbag.

55
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.790
This is an interesting topic.
I feel like we should just open the show.

56
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:44.170
I don't know if all guys would like that or not,

57
00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:47.050
but let's just open the show and we'll get into it.
Okay.

58
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.350
Let's just open this show.
Okay.

59
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.460
<v 4>Hi there.
Uh,
my name's Pete.</v>

60
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.470
Today I'm going to be demonstrating a new toy that I got and the cool thing

61
00:04:56.471 --> 00:04:59.320
about it is it incorporates a power Israel

62
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.000
and the pledge light and your heart day.

63
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.170
<v 1>Oh,
don't bring it.</v>

64
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.080
Well,
go to your mom's house.

65
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.870
<v 0>This guy seems cool.
This is,</v>

66
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.670
this is how guys want to be with you all the time.
All the time.
Yeah.

67
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.360
Do you realize that if guys were allowed to just court the way they want to,

68
00:05:29.361 --> 00:05:32.440
like what you're talking about?
Yeah.
That first of all,
like uh,

69
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.540
sexually transmitted diseases would be rampant.
Yeah.

70
00:05:35.541 --> 00:05:39.560
The population would actually,
I think dwindle because everyone would die,

71
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.810
I think.
No,
I think you're right.
Like HIV would have spread you too.

72
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.200
Like so much faster.
Yeah.
Everybody be a good thing.

73
00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.360
There's too many people,
I think.
Yeah.
Yeah.

74
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.270
And like everybody's genitals would just be sealed with herpes sores have so

75
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.010
crestally man fear.
Yeah.
You guys would just,

76
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:08.130
it would run rampant disease if men could just do it the way they all wanted
him.

77
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.450
Or some women essentially keep this whole thing in check and working course.

78
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.400
Well,
there's some,
there's some scholarly wagons out there that really only lag,

79
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.980
that don't care and are just like dudes.
But yeah.
You know,
then there's decent,

80
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:26.080
those girls are damaged guts,
you know what I mean?
Of course those girls have,

81
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.770
they have beat right here as the debt

82
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.370
and your hard day
from the 70s.

83
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.040
I don't know,
man.
He's talking about flashlights though.
So,
yeah.

84
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.430
Let's,
um,
do I have to know?
I want to know,

85
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:47.150
I want to know about this toy boy,
how it works.
Let's see what he did.

86
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:50.000
Was He what he,
I think he may have built this himself.
I think he did.

87
00:06:50.001 --> 00:06:51.050
I definitely did.

88
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.840
<v 5>Whoa.
Whoa.
That's a huge one.</v>

89
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:01.560
And

90
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.120
<v 0>to help hold it for a really fun drive himself.</v>

91
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.010
I'd be proud of myself too.
I'm proud of,

92
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.520
but that is enormous.

93
00:07:11.521 --> 00:07:16.521
I mean it seems like it's sort of counter productive because it looks like it's

94
00:07:16.951 --> 00:07:20.640
a like a real,
now you're just not thinking of it the way he is.
He can,

95
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.310
he and his friend can put their dicks in there.
Yeah,
I guess so.

96
00:07:23.311 --> 00:07:25.010
It may have your friends over again.

97
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.840
A cool thing to do is hang out with your friends and get your dicks off.

98
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:33.060
It's a DP here.
If there was no social stigma about that,

99
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.850
that's another thing that they be got would do.

100
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:40.090
You know if they weren't like in fear of being thought of as you know.
Yeah.

101
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.050
Then every guy would be like,
let's Jack off today.
Right now,

102
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:48.510
every guy always be like,
why don't we just hang out and come on each other?

103
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:49.583
All right.

104
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.980
Now do you think that DPS are gay?
What do you mean?

105
00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:57.841
Well,

106
00:07:57.841 --> 00:08:01.140
because you've got one in the pink and one in the stink and then they're like

107
00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:06.620
right next to each other doing grind and do sometimes you DP in the same hole,

108
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:12.740
but even that's not gay.
Yes,
totally gay.
Grinding Dick's with some days.

109
00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:15.420
I don't think so.
I think you actually have to be like extra

110
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:20.010
sexually,
you know strong.

111
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.670
You have to be a total stud to do that.
To do that,

112
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.590
to do two and the pink.
Yeah,

113
00:08:25.591 --> 00:08:30.120
because you have to block that out and still focused on her and stay in the

114
00:08:30.121 --> 00:08:31.530
moment.
That's what I'm saying.

115
00:08:31.531 --> 00:08:35.940
So half of your penis is having gay sex because you're grinding to day,
I guess.

116
00:08:35.941 --> 00:08:39.140
I see what you're saying is having Heteros we were half gay.
If,

117
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:40.270
if it's a vaginal Dhea,

118
00:08:40.271 --> 00:08:44.190
I thinks you're just a total deviant is what you are to be able to do that.

119
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:48.060
You're not a normal guy.
Right,
right.
No,
no,
you're not.

120
00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:49.530
You're who does that?

121
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.670
Do people really do that in their private sex lives and their private life?
Yes,

122
00:08:53.671 --> 00:08:58.671
but rare two in your veggies and sometimes they go double anal,

123
00:08:58.951 --> 00:09:01.780
double vaginal.
No,
nobody's really doing mad.

124
00:09:01.781 --> 00:09:06.330
Sure they are and sometimes they're going to triple.
Yeah.
I'm writing a story.

125
00:09:06.331 --> 00:09:10.590
I'm running it.
Yes I am.
I am.
I swear to you.
What are you writing his story?

126
00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:15.030
I'm writing a story about the lady who did the first,
uh,
two,
two and two.

127
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.870
What do you mean you're writing a story to scale for what?
To shoot something.

128
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.210
Oh my gosh.
Oh,
and she's talking about her old now and she's talking about her,

129
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:26.330
her early days.
She's reminiscing but not really reminiscing.

130
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:28.440
She's saying that she was the first and she's proud of it.

131
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:33.780
I'm proud of my part of our ourselves.
Jules had two and u three and U.

132
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.610
Yeah.
And she didn't even know until people were like,

133
00:09:35.611 --> 00:09:39.630
you had to and you and you had three incidences.
Iowa.
I'll Paul about buffalo.

134
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.970
I was like proud of myself.
That's really,

135
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:47.780
it wasn't until uh,
wait.
Yeah,

136
00:09:47.781 --> 00:09:50.380
it was a lot of Dick's,
you know,
ain't nobody got time for today.

137
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:55.410
It wasn't UNSW hallways that you have to when you have three in years that I was

138
00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:59.250
like,
I forget it out though.
It really is.
I know.
It's so old.

139
00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:01.650
I don't know even know where it is,
but it really is.

140
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.540
It's a lot to have to in your ass.
Well,
even two in your assholes a lot.

141
00:10:06.541 --> 00:10:09.990
But two in Gosh and your virgin is like,
yeah,

142
00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:13.080
but at least you're virgin is made for them.
Your asshole

143
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.330
holds 90 made for not design for any of that.
I can accommodate,

144
00:10:18.331 --> 00:10:21.900
but it's not designed for it.
You're a virgin is at least like,
all right,

145
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:26.340
you're a genius things.
It's a really big Dick.
It's like Jesus down

146
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.140
to in you.
I don't know.
Do you put the,
is it,

147
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.770
do you think that people really put the dog in the bathtub too?
Of course.

148
00:10:34.771 --> 00:10:38.970
Is that real?
Of course they do.
Yes they do.

149
00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:42.900
You can't put your beans in her too.
Yeah,
you can.
Have you seen it?

150
00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.190
I've seen it in movies.

151
00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.170
A movie again with a talk like these are not films or movies,

152
00:10:49.171 --> 00:10:52.170
so it was Francis Ford Coppola movie.
I was just watching it the other day.

153
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.890
I forget what it's called.
They shouldn't be called films or movies.
They're not.

154
00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.460
It's not that.
It's something different.
It's what people do.
Use a different word.

155
00:10:59.461 --> 00:11:01.150
It's what people do.
Let's see this toy and action.

156
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:02.773
<v 5>Me Too.</v>

157
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:05.840
<v 0>Oh my kids.
No</v>

158
00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:09.020
<v 5>shame.
Oh my God.</v>

159
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.100
He's jerking off on this,
answered it.

160
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:18.120
<v 0>How do you like watching this dude?</v>

161
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:21.790
He's pretty funny.
Let's see.

162
00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:27.120
<v 4>Bus does and I just had a really good night.</v>

163
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:29.130
Take care.

164
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.790
<v 0>Yeah,
the cleanup,
he did the thumbs up.</v>

165
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.660
The problem with men and sex toys is the cleanup because you know there isn't

166
00:11:35.661 --> 00:11:39.260
any,
there's no cleanup happening.
You know that.
Yeah.

167
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.850
They're just letting that stuff k garb and get grody are and it,
I agree.

168
00:11:43.851 --> 00:11:47.300
That's probably the worst part of dues is how nasty they are.

169
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:50.610
If he could invent something that had like a,

170
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.250
a condom in it or something and that you could just be disposable,

171
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:57.700
like diaper bags or something.
Wow.

172
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.140
What'd you hook up with that guy?
No.
What'd you have?

173
00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.880
If it was between him and the guy from a few weeks ago,

174
00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:07.600
that's a swinger that talks about Christ.
Ah,
this guy,

175
00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:11.440
because this guy is super stoked on like a toy,
right?
Perverted stuff.

176
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.460
He'd be stuck up in a real angle.
You'd be banging you and he'd be like,

177
00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:20.380
you know Jesus.
No to saying you'd be like,
Oh man,
can we just get back,
hone it?

178
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.130
Honestly,
honestly,
all those law,

179
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:29.110
I would hate the guys rap.
Like you said,
like he'd have a whole rap.
Yeah.

180
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:30.790
He'd have to talk to,

181
00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:34.510
I don't want to talk about Jesus or your bullshit like that.
That would kill me.

182
00:12:34.511 --> 00:12:36.670
At least this guy is just straight forward.
Yeah.

183
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:41.710
He just wants to Jack his dick in front of you,
which is fine.
Right?
That's fine.

184
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.910
That's not even a big deal.
I know.
It's really not.

185
00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:50.260
I've seen so many guys do that.
Everybody's all upset about Louie.
It's like,
yeah,

186
00:12:50.261 --> 00:12:54.610
I've seen guys do that.
Some essence.
I was 12 and public.
Jesus.

187
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.510
I don't feel like it's that scarring,
you know?
Wait,
wait.

188
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.750
Dave Chappelle said in his own [inaudible] personality,

189
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.460
that wasn't much of a dream at all.

190
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.720
Hey,
I heard that right.
Is that Ryan Seacrest's delay?
Latest pervert.
Yeah.

191
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.340
They say he grabbed,
uh,
some pussies or something.
Well,

192
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.570
ladies accusing him of like brushing up with is hard.
Dick on her,

193
00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:27.220
his stylist to stylist,
you know,
come on.

194
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.210
I know if that's what she's accusing him of.
I think he likes guys.

195
00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:35.560
I always thought he's so Faye.
He's not.
He's pretty,
but he likes girls.

196
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:37.460
He's always been non,

197
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:42.640
he's gender Pronoun is something else.
Yeah,
no,
I think he likes,

198
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.730
he likes women,
but he's just,
you know,
he's a certain lane of dude.

199
00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.550
Very well groomed.
Yeah.

200
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:56.140
What does that,
that became a term metro service.
Why is that called metro-sexual?

201
00:13:56.170 --> 00:14:00.820
Heterosexual with mixed with a man.
Maybe Maduro.
Male.

202
00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:05.470
Hetero.
A male.
Hetero.
A metro male.
Hetero Homo.
A male.

203
00:14:05.471 --> 00:14:09.910
Hemal Nah,
I don't fuck it.
Now let's Google it it saying,
yeah.

204
00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:15.380
Metro male.
Hetero man.
I don't fucking care.
What is that from the 90s?
Yeah,

205
00:14:15.381 --> 00:14:18.280
that's an old one.
I remember when this young urban,

206
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:23.050
heterosexual male with liberal political views and interest in fashion and a

207
00:14:23.051 --> 00:14:28.050
refined sense of taste,
but the same.
Where does the word cuddle?
Know what the,
um,

208
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.560
what is the,
let's see,
Metro sexual,
what does it etymology.

209
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:35.320
Some big word for you.
Good luck.

210
00:14:35.321 --> 00:14:39.820
Sports and Metro meets homosexual.
Okay,

211
00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:42.023
<v 2>but</v>

212
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.220
<v 0>metropolitan,
that's what,
that's what the metropolitan,</v>

213
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.053
<v 2>hmm.</v>

214
00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:52.040
<v 0>No Ma.
Oh,
it's metro meets homosexual metro.
That's what it's saying.</v>

215
00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:59.810
<v 6>I don't have to fucking bandwidth today for that.
Mm.
I Dunno either,</v>

216
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:01.010
whatever.
Anyway,

217
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:08.110
I would like to say that I was charged with the task of picking up your coffee

218
00:15:08.331 --> 00:15:11.570
today before we started taping and I,

219
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.240
it always strikes a little bit of panic in my heart,

220
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:19.450
which makes me happy when I have to pick up your drink order because it's very

221
00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:20.211
specific.

222
00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:24.440
And I know last episode we were discussing the three locations that we frequent

223
00:15:24.441 --> 00:15:28.700
and I went to the and valuing good service.

224
00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.980
Right.
And I went to the most inferior of the three one,

225
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:37.880
two and the one that I went to is a drive through and I prefer that because I

226
00:15:37.881 --> 00:15:40.420
don't like to get into the car.
Drive through.
Yes.

227
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.700
That's the one I went to was the one that I told you was exemplary.
He again,

228
00:15:43.701 --> 00:15:45.890
but I'm not going to get out of my third fucking car.

229
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.460
The one in the horrible parking lot.
Oh yeah.
Cause he,
there's also a fourth one.

230
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:54.750
Where's that?
The fourth one is if you start heading towards the freeway.
Yeah,

231
00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.720
that one's better.
I drive.
But that's further from our house.

232
00:15:58.721 --> 00:16:03.650
The problem with the drive through those closest to us is that it's at an exit

233
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:04.600
from the freeway.

234
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.910
It's a terrible intersection leaving the freeway or entering the freeway.

235
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.430
This is an entrance exit.
And so it is a,

236
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.470
it's a highly trafficked area because of its location.

237
00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:20.750
Too busy.
I know.
And I went in and I have to agree with you Tom,

238
00:16:20.751 --> 00:16:25.100
that this one is the worst.
A,
they're not as friendly,
uh,
be.

239
00:16:25.101 --> 00:16:29.240
I had to repeat my verbal order three times for him to repeat it back correctly

240
00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:34.270
and see they ask,
it's just a splash of,
of home.

241
00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.450
So your drink is an iced venti coffee,
a Venti iced coffee,

242
00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:44.660
extra ice and just a splash of whole milk.
That's right now.
And I,

243
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:49.240
I very,
I specify just a dash.
I don't even say Splat,

244
00:16:49.241 --> 00:16:50.450
a dash of whole milk.

245
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:53.360
And they gave it to me and it was like blonde and I was like,

246
00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:55.650
and I get back to her,
I go,
listen,
this is for my husband.

247
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.070
He's going to beat the shit out of me if I don't get this right.

248
00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.980
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Why would you?
Why?
Well,

249
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.220
I feel like you're going to beat the shadow.
Come on.

250
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.640
That's not even cool to put out there.
And I go,

251
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.950
I handed back once and I got more coffee,
please.
This is for my husband.

252
00:17:09.951 --> 00:17:12.200
He likes just so they get it back to me.

253
00:17:12.201 --> 00:17:15.320
It's still too blunt and I go again a second time I go,
dude,

254
00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:18.560
this is still too light,
please.
I'm going to get a severely bit,

255
00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:20.950
my lips going to get split up and you don't even know pregnant.

256
00:17:20.951 --> 00:17:25.820
And he just pushes me down the stairs and then she gave it back.
Still not good.

257
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.850
And a third time,
three times.
Can you kidding me?

258
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.210
I can't bring back an inferior quality product.
I really would love to you.

259
00:17:32.211 --> 00:17:35.030
Thank you for doing that.
Kill me.
Would not kill you.

260
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:40.130
And her attitude on the third time.
Definitely.
Right?
I mean,
rightly so.

261
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:43.940
I had three times.
She really hated me by that third time.

262
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.850
It's because of that location at the other one.

263
00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:50.070
You can make any request and they do

264
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.550
<v 0>it with a smile.
They're just fine with it.
Yeah.
Well,
they listen better,
I feel.</v>

265
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.880
But this,
this poor staff,
I think there's Doug,
you said too many cars.

266
00:17:56.881 --> 00:17:59.440
We've become my dad.

267
00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.180
I know with Starbucks way he is with Mcdonald's.
We,

268
00:18:03.181 --> 00:18:05.350
you mean you will listen to you talking about it.

269
00:18:05.351 --> 00:18:09.810
It's only because I'm jumping on your train of lunacy.
You started this.

270
00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:16.570
<v 7>Yeah.
So you're boycotting the gunnels.
Yeah.
Well I love their coffee back.</v>

271
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:21.180
It's the best coffee.
Right?
But they've gone to,
to drive two lanes.

272
00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:26.220
Yeah.
And so what happened is,
I mean time did that,
yeah.

273
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.470
The lanes the other day,

274
00:18:28.471 --> 00:18:33.450
it took me 13 minutes to get my coffee to the dresser.
Yeah.

275
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.153
It's too long.

276
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.600
And he end because even though they have two lanes,

277
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.780
they don't process it as fast as they should.
So,

278
00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:46.260
so from a customer point of view,
it's actually attached marker.

279
00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:49.680
And I talked to them about that.
And what do you do when you talk to them?

280
00:18:49.681 --> 00:18:52.770
How have you talked to him or I call it the one 800 and Mcdonald's not burden in

281
00:18:52.771 --> 00:18:55.850
Illinois.
And they're very nice and they,
you know,
they,

282
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:57.970
I think food generally concerned.
But I've,

283
00:18:57.971 --> 00:18:59.460
I've noticed this and a couple of other,

284
00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:03.360
so now I go to Mcdonald's that have single lines and that you're not,

285
00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:06.090
but you said you were a boy cloud that really boy counting.
But I'm doing it.

286
00:19:06.091 --> 00:19:08.880
But you're boycotting the double lane.
Dual lines,
you know,

287
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:12.060
in Mcdonald's did not get your business.
Do Elaine Mcdonald's don't get my bonus.

288
00:19:12.061 --> 00:19:15.390
I don't want to go to single and Mcdonald's not because they're,

289
00:19:15.391 --> 00:19:19.140
that one is not convenient for me and I'm not going as much as I used to go to

290
00:19:19.141 --> 00:19:19.974
adorable.

291
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.860
<v 0>I mean,
yeah,
that's,
you know,
that's from seven years ago.</v>

292
00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:28.490
I can't believe that seven years old,
God,
time flies really does.

293
00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:32.200
And we've been married.
They've been married three years.
No,
I think so.

294
00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:37.030
23 years.
Yeah.
Oh wait,
we've been married 10 years but together and when we,

295
00:19:37.031 --> 00:19:39.550
we haven't really been together.
14 years.

296
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.180
Been together probably four or five years now.
That has been serious.

297
00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.630
Cause that was dating.
I was dating six years ago.
I remember.
Hey,

298
00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.600
but you were dating up until I got pregnant the second time.
Yeah.

299
00:19:49.601 --> 00:19:51.910
I mean I've still,
I mean I'm not exclusive with you.

300
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:53.710
When you go to film this movie,

301
00:19:53.711 --> 00:19:58.060
Do you think you'll remain faithful or are we going to do that?
I mean,

302
00:19:58.061 --> 00:20:00.160
I'm five months pregnant.
I feel sexy.

303
00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:04.270
I feel like I'm ready to put myself out there.
Yeah.
What do you want?

304
00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.490
How are we going to date other people?
I don't know.

305
00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.790
I don't know what's going to happen.
I don't know.

306
00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:15.730
You brought this up this morning that your dad's in fluxion is weird on certain.

307
00:20:15.731 --> 00:20:19.270
Yeah.
He's like,
he did it right here.
I know.
It's like,

308
00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:21.620
and that's a dual lane and

309
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:26.260
he says at the end he's like,
he'll be like,

310
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:30.790
mother and I are going to be taking cruises.

311
00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:36.220
We like to cruise.
Right.
Why are you saying it like that?

312
00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.810
Like why did you say we'd like to cruise and he's like,
just what we like to do.

313
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:46.060
He goes right back to work.
He didn't do it.
Yeah.
He hears English.

314
00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:50.290
He speaks English his way and then he hears commonly said words correctly.

315
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.160
It's really weird.
You know what does it auditory?
Yeah,

316
00:20:54.161 --> 00:20:56.860
maybe he should get his ears checked.
Do you think his hearing is?

317
00:20:56.861 --> 00:21:01.780
I think it's a lost cause.
I think just let it go.
Let them 70.

318
00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:06.840
Dual.
So I uh,

319
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:11.110
value.
Okay.

320
00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.700
And do you have a favorite employee?

321
00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.530
<v 7>The single lane.
Mcdonald's.
Like you did it,
the other one?
No,</v>

322
00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:19.970
I haven't really cultivated a favorite employ like it did.

323
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.540
Amanda was my favorite employee.

324
00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:26.090
Was what'd you like about her maximum efficiency.
Okay.

325
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:31.140
<v 0>Okay.
Maximum efficiency and maximum efficiency.
All right.</v>

326
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:32.143
And uh,

327
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:37.310
how it goes when you go through the drive through right here.

328
00:21:37.311 --> 00:21:40.640
Dad Too.
When he,
when he comes over here,
um,

329
00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:43.910
he always does this where he taught,
he's like,
okay.

330
00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:47.900
And he like gives you the eye thing?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You have to like agree with him.

331
00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:51.000
He gives you like an eye affirmation.
You're like,
uh,
uh,

332
00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.240
dualet Mcdonald's and I get my business.
Okay.

333
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:57.620
And then he pauses and looks at you and you have to nod back.

334
00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:00.390
I always feel the pressure to like affirm when he's affirming.

335
00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:06.500
He has his preferences.
That Mcdonald's one is so weird.

336
00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:11.790
Not Weird.
Obviously it's a very popular place to go,
but I can love Mcdonald's.

337
00:22:11.791 --> 00:22:14.750
Yeah,
I tell you that I've really been holding back the urge to go there.

338
00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:18.740
I want to eat there every day,
but it's not really good for your growing fetus.

339
00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:23.990
Yeah.
No.
What's your favorite item at Mcdonald's?
I haven't been in awhile.

340
00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:28.070
I mean it's definitely breakfast though.
Oh really?
Oh yeah.
Oh,

341
00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:31.670
for like a quarter pounder.
Yeah.
I love breakfast.

342
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.560
You do love breakfast?
Yeah.
What do you get the egg mcmuffin?
Yeah.

343
00:22:36.561 --> 00:22:41.330
Or sausage.
Egg and cheese.
That's a really killer one.
Has a lot of calories,

344
00:22:41.331 --> 00:22:45.890
isn't it?
Yeah.
I try to stay away from there,
but no,
I know we don't
really,

345
00:22:45.891 --> 00:22:49.850
only because of,
you know,
the bread part of it.
The biscuit.
Yeah.
Yeah.

346
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:54.200
It's delicious.
And they're uh,
that those little fried Hash Brown,
you know,

347
00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:58.560
the how shoes are the best.
That's great.
Get your life always gives me wrong.

348
00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:03.920
It is amazing food.
Two in the morning.
No,
I'm just a few.
We give him breakfast.

349
00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:08.960
No,
cause they serve breakfast 24 hours now.
Oh,
I'm saying if,
and you go there,

350
00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:13.070
any of their food at,
you know,
if you had been drinking is,
you know,

351
00:23:13.071 --> 00:23:15.150
nothing's better than Mcdonald's when you're,
when you're,

352
00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:20.160
when you're like done drinking.
Like I eat something that's amazing.

353
00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.960
That,
and I used to go to Taco bell a lot.
Talk about,

354
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:27.860
I know who got me to Taco Bell.
You,
we lived in the Rampart division.

355
00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:29.480
There was one that was near,

356
00:23:29.481 --> 00:23:33.650
they're near our house and that would be like a lot of times my might've been

357
00:23:33.651 --> 00:23:35.640
why I was gaining weight.
I might've been a,

358
00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:39.980
it's like when I would come home at midnight.
Oh stop there.
Ah,

359
00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:45.380
it's so damn nasty.
Last time I had taco bell was what I did.
Uh,
Madison,

360
00:23:45.381 --> 00:23:46.214
Wisconsin

361
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:50.710
<v 6>and Madison.
Not the other one.
Sorry,
not Madison.
What's the other one?
Oh,</v>

362
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.040
you do the Appleton.
Appleton.

363
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:57.490
And I drank red wine and I was hungry and we stopped to Taco Bell and I had a

364
00:23:58.161 --> 00:24:03.161
bean and cheese burrito and a Mexican pizza on top of red wine in my belly and I

365
00:24:03.321 --> 00:24:06.230
laid in bed and I was like,
dear God,
please don't let me vomit.

366
00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:10.820
I will never eat taco bell again.
I felt so sick and that's the last time man,

367
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:12.890
and that was what,
Oh nine

368
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:14.520
<v 0>they're are known for getting people sick.</v>

369
00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:22.140
I know that Twitter feed we look at as Neil Hamburger.
Yeah,

370
00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:27.150
he does a search for like Taco bell and sick and then he retweets really a

371
00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.450
fucking hilarious.
It'd be like 30 in a row.

372
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:36.510
A talkable got me sick as fuck again.
I feel like talk about poison me.

373
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:42.170
<v 6>Well,
the meters,
I said the meat is worse,
obviously worse than Mcdonald's meat.</v>

374
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:43.600
It's like prison grade.

375
00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.510
<v 0>Really pretty bad.
Yeah.
You have to have.</v>

376
00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:51.960
Taco bell is one of those things where you have to mask the quality with heat

377
00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:54.143
piping hot,

378
00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:59.580
so you kind of have the illusion that it's human food because if it cools down

379
00:24:59.581 --> 00:25:03.110
and you really can taste the quality,
any fast food,
really,
that's cool too.

380
00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:07.800
It's not congeals and it's hard.
Mcdonald's too.
I mean that's the worst call.

381
00:25:07.801 --> 00:25:11.790
D you can't even touch a mcnugget past the top point.
Hot,
hot,
hot and nasty.

382
00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:16.050
I'd be like,
is this on fire?
Right.
Either so nasty if it even,

383
00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:19.800
yeah,
if you're going gets lukewarm,
you're like good

384
00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:24.280
<v 6>and it's,
Mcdonald's always makes my car smell like farts.
Have you noticed that?</v>

385
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:28.320
<v 0>Yeah.
Their food smells like fart.
That's all you see their slogan?</v>

386
00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:33.180
Eighties I think Mcdonald's are food.
Smells like Fart.

387
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:40.270
Dear precious,
delicious.
By the way,
do you want to make the announcements?

388
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:42.960
I'm on here.

389
00:25:42.961 --> 00:25:47.190
I know some people may already know this who follow me.

390
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:52.590
<v 5>[inaudible] chips in a bowl</v>

391
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.903
<v 0>and</v>

392
00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:07.930
caddied and kibble.
This one's my favorite.
This is for a major announcement.

393
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:12.940
Announcements.
Oh my.
Such a cute sound,

394
00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:13.813
isn't it?
Yeah.

395
00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:18.530
<v 6>Makes me miss.
Having a cat.
So go ahead.
All right.</v>

396
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:23.380
As you know,
being pregnant,
I've been farting out a lot.
Okay.
A lot of times.

397
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:29.560
Not In my control.
Not a lot I can do about it.
We were eating dinner on Tuesday,

398
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:34.830
February 27th at 6:40 PM and I was talking meal and I stopped mid sentence and I

399
00:26:37.871 --> 00:26:42.871
farted and I burped at the same time and I will continue talking.

400
00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:47.190
I was like,
so anyway,
and then I go call Tommy.
I just had a double pipe.
Classic.

401
00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:50.940
Yeah.
I just had his own apartment.
Okay.
Cause it happened.
It happened so fast.

402
00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:55.520
<v 8>Buried</v>

403
00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:59.970
<v 9>rare.
And even though I want to be there with you and all of these moments to</v>

404
00:26:59.971 --> 00:27:03.390
celebrate and to share in your success,

405
00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:08.430
lot of push back,
what are you talking about of people are going,

406
00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.700
hey,
she's pregnant.
You know,

407
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:15.150
things are going haywire and they're gaming the system if you will.
Yeah.

408
00:27:15.151 --> 00:27:16.500
And they're like,
that doesn't count.

409
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:21.480
And they really are calling you out because it wasn't too long ago that you were

410
00:27:21.481 --> 00:27:26.090
discrediting people's double pipe classics,
you know?
No,
but only right.

411
00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:30.320
<v 6>Cause if they're trying to force it by feeding themselves re fried beans or
your,</v>

412
00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:33.020
if you're trying to,
I didn't try to game the system.

413
00:27:33.021 --> 00:27:35.350
This was a natural occurrence.
I,
you know,

414
00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.120
I didn't modify my diet in any special way.

415
00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:42.160
<v 9>Yeah.
Well I don't know a lot of people,
a lot of people were,</v>

416
00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:46.780
oh law that people have did.
They did.
I'm serious.
These people are haters,

417
00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:47.790
you know?
Wow.

418
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:51.430
Maybe they need to have their own double pipe and then they'll feel better,

419
00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:54.580
you know?
Yeah.
I'm not going to said no video.
No double pipe.

420
00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:57.850
Yeah,
I couldn't.

421
00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:02.140
This is a thing that happens is one of our people,
oh my God,

422
00:28:02.141 --> 00:28:05.530
this guy got you twice did he wrote,

423
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:08.230
I'm going to have to blow the whistle and say it doesn't count.

424
00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:12.580
Being pregnant with baby gene's number two is obviously if performance enhancing

425
00:28:12.581 --> 00:28:15.100
and more dues,
more bodily awesomeness.

426
00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:19.280
We have heard in previous mom's house conversations that enhancing the endeavor

427
00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.890
is a strict grounds for dismissing it.

428
00:28:21.891 --> 00:28:25.300
True double pipe classic is a rarity list and make it common course.

429
00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:28.810
You're going to have to retract that double pipe classic from the scoreboard.

430
00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:33.460
All love.
No.
Hey,
just keeping all that haters on the reel,

431
00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:38.290
we can recognize that the haters was supposed to be the haters.

432
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.890
Yeah.
Much love.
No.
Hey guys.
Yeah,
that's all the hairs writing about a typo.

433
00:28:41.891 --> 00:28:46.480
But I mean he,
um,
he was,
he was very adamant that you didn't,

434
00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.360
you don't get what you think you get,
you know,
you don't deserve it.

435
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:55.110
<v 6>Is pregnancy and enhancement necessarily or a different physical state of being?</v>

436
00:28:55.511 --> 00:29:00.380
I mean,
look,
if you're asleep and you fart and Burp at the same time,
yeah,

437
00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:02.080
I don't know.
I,
I look,

438
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:07.110
all I know is it happened and it was so sudden and I was talking to you,

439
00:29:07.331 --> 00:29:11.830
so I kind of wasn't paying attention and just want to say for everybody out

440
00:29:11.831 --> 00:29:16.240
there,
if it hasn't happened for you yet,
don't try to make it happen,

441
00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:21.250
but pay attention when it does.
Cause that almost passed me by.
Yeah.
You know,

442
00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:24.800
I could have,
I almost got out of that moment,
not even realizing

443
00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:29.090
<v 9>it was pretty amazing.
I mean,
I was sitting three feet from you and I was,</v>

444
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:35.170
you know,
I mean,
I'm the,
I guess the,

445
00:29:35.171 --> 00:29:37.490
the person that coined the term,
yes.

446
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:41.840
Even I am in awe of it when I,
you know what I mean?
It's like,
yeah,

447
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:45.530
<v 0>it's a how I imagine Steve jobs felt when they'd show them a new iPhone and was</v>

448
00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:47.650
like,
wow,
that was the adventure.

449
00:29:47.651 --> 00:29:51.850
And then it just gets better and better and proofs.
I was at a loss for words.

450
00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.220
Yeah.
Well that's,
that's how everybody feels when they have,

451
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:58.640
or they're around ductile pipe.
When's the last time you had one?
I'm trying to,

452
00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:03.550
God,
it's been a while.
It shouldn't happen to you.
You know,

453
00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:08.620
more than once every few years.
I think I had mine two years ago.

454
00:30:08.621 --> 00:30:12.790
The last one.
It takes time.
Yeah.
It takes time.

455
00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:18.640
Really?
Does,
you know what I'm going to,

456
00:30:18.641 --> 00:30:21.860
I'm going to count it as a win.
As a double pipe.
Classic guys.
I,

457
00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:24.640
what am I supposed to do?
It's exciting when Aaron is,
I mean,

458
00:30:24.641 --> 00:30:29.050
you get to make that call.
You tell me.
I mean,
I was there.

459
00:30:29.051 --> 00:30:32.320
I was,
it was,
it was in my face basically.

460
00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:36.730
It seem real to me.
Are you going to say that the pregnancy is,

461
00:30:36.731 --> 00:30:40.240
is it a performance enhancement?
I don't think so.

462
00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:47.170
So passionate about them happening that I don't see it that way,

463
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:50.980
but I understand that,
you know,
the more successful you get,

464
00:30:50.981 --> 00:30:53.680
you're going to have people that nurse.
Yeah.
Well here's,

465
00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:57.640
here's what I consider to be a performance enhancer.
Okay.
Diarrhea,

466
00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:59.170
because you fart a lot.

467
00:30:59.171 --> 00:31:01.990
So like let's say you're on the toilet with a bout of diarrhea and you're

468
00:31:01.991 --> 00:31:06.991
shotgunning farts and then you burp as you're shotgunning a diarrhea fart.

469
00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:12.400
I don't consider that to be a true double pipe.
Yeah.
If you're gaming the system,

470
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:17.280
drinking soda and like cramming re fried beans down your stomach,
eating those,

471
00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:21.860
it's still
now it's still very hard to manufacturer.

472
00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:25.870
You're not going to manufacture it.
Your body chooses a way out.

473
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:27.250
Generally one or the other.

474
00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:30.280
It's like a hole in one when you actually have it go out.

475
00:31:30.281 --> 00:31:31.960
But it's pretty amazing.
Yeah.
Well.

476
00:31:31.961 --> 00:31:36.961
Cause I remember when I farted I had two farts and the first one I just fired.

477
00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.990
The second time I farted,
I burped at the same time.

478
00:31:40.991 --> 00:31:45.060
And I remember it felt so different and that's why I pause and I went.

479
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:49.440
That was a double pipe because it feels different.
It feels weird.
Yeah.

480
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:53.500
Well it feels different and it feels weird when an angel touches you on your

481
00:31:53.501 --> 00:31:58.030
shoulder too.
You know those are,
that doesn't happen everyday either.

482
00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:02.500
Right?
You just happen to have an amazing thing happened to you.

483
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:05.380
You should be really at the miracle.
By the way,

484
00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:08.730
I noticed you've been making pizza a lot through your pregnancy and a lot of

485
00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:12.460
pregnant women.
Do you find it to be inconvenient?
Massively.

486
00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:13.840
Would you like a solution?

487
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:19.310
<v 10>Sometimes I get jealous that guys can go to the bathroom just about anywhere.</v>

488
00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:23.060
But Ladies Now you can pee like gentlemen to go.

489
00:32:23.061 --> 00:32:26.810
Girl is a reusable silicone funnel that helps you tinkle standing up.

490
00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:31.610
It's made a flexible medical grade silicone that will adapt to your body.
Well,

491
00:32:31.611 --> 00:32:35.570
it's anti spill.
An anti splash design keeps things tidy and mess free.

492
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:39.980
When we tried it out it was super easy and drip free plus go girl lets you

493
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:44.180
<v 0>be discreet.
You only need to address just enough to give go grill coverage.</v>

494
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:47.210
Nothing too conspicuous and you want to try it.

495
00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:50.840
I would if I were camping like those broad is if you're camping,

496
00:32:50.841 --> 00:32:53.600
can't you just I suppose squad.
Yeah,

497
00:32:53.601 --> 00:32:57.500
but you don't want to squat down where there's ants and bugs and grass and shit.

498
00:32:57.501 --> 00:33:01.720
Like that's why this is idea.
Put this over your badge and it acts as a painter.

499
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:06.530
Like a funnel.
It's a funnel.
Just a funnel,
but then you ain't,
don't know.

500
00:33:06.531 --> 00:33:10.370
I guess the funnel comes folded in a capsule with an instructional bag.

501
00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.040
That way you can rinse,
shake and store.
When you're done.

502
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:14.450
Besides being medical grade,

503
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:18.470
the silicone is antimicrobial and it can be cleaned and reused.

504
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:21.980
Wash it with liquid soap and let it dry.
Washington boiling water.

505
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:25.110
Or you can even run it through the dishwasher on the top rack.
Yeah,

506
00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.093
they're big problem.

507
00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:30.140
<v 9>What did they don't show you?
Um,</v>

508
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.090
somebody using it.

509
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:35.740
<v 0>What can we see someone using it were a cartoon demonstration.</v>

510
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:39.000
Nothing like that now,
Huh?
Yeah.

511
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:42.040
So show me somebody actually doing it.
Cause she says,

512
00:33:42.041 --> 00:33:45.250
so you pulled down your pants but then the funnel would have to be pointed out

513
00:33:45.251 --> 00:33:48.940
like a dick.
Yeah.
So that you can point it away from your pants.
Right.

514
00:33:48.941 --> 00:33:53.620
And but I mean as a viewer or as a consumer,
I want to see this thing in action.

515
00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:58.390
I'd like to as well.
But I think my problem with the go girl,

516
00:33:58.391 --> 00:33:59.830
it's just like I said,
like what if the font,

517
00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:03.340
the funnel has to be pointed up and out so that you're not pissing all over your

518
00:34:03.341 --> 00:34:04.360
clothes should do.

519
00:34:04.361 --> 00:34:09.360
They should make that funnel and then have like a foot long dick as the sprout

520
00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:14.880
so that you have a rad chance to get it on you.
But also you can kind of,

521
00:34:14.890 --> 00:34:17.920
it's like kind of a wink at the guy,
you know?
Like check out how big mine is.

522
00:34:17.921 --> 00:34:22.570
Gavi red.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It shouldn't be discreet.
It should be enormous.
Enormous.
Yeah.

523
00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:26.800
I want to carry around a footlong funnel and choose between our 10 12 and 18

524
00:34:26.801 --> 00:34:31.660
inch penis models.
Yeah.
This is good for camping.

525
00:34:31.661 --> 00:34:34.000
Definitely.
Yeah.
Cause it's nasty to squat.

526
00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:38.170
I fucking hate squatting like on the side of the road or whatever.

527
00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:40.390
When you have to pee in and there's no toilets around.

528
00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.240
So worst seems like you should try it out.
Try it out.

529
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:46.720
Try it out top piss on me.
Beat me.
Oh,

530
00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:51.240
I know you've been watching Oj Shelly,
like yeah.
You know what happened often

531
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:54.810
<v 9>was,
um,
American crime story,</v>

532
00:34:54.811 --> 00:34:58.080
that FX series.
So this is their second season.

533
00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:03.240
This time they picked the Versace murderer and it is phenomenal.

534
00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:07.200
If you guys are looking for a really,
really good one,

535
00:35:07.201 --> 00:35:11.250
use your FX app or go on iTunes and you can buy it.
You know,

536
00:35:11.251 --> 00:35:14.600
if you haven't been watching it.
Um,
American crime stories,

537
00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:17.250
the name of the series,
they focus on the Versace.

538
00:35:17.251 --> 00:35:19.500
It's really just amazing storytelling.

539
00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:24.660
I think Ryan Murphy is the show runner on that.
Great.
I the kid,

540
00:35:24.661 --> 00:35:25.560
they got to play.

541
00:35:25.561 --> 00:35:30.440
Andrew Cunanan is tremendous actor and it,

542
00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:34.010
and also they got Edgar Ramirez to play Versace and they got,
um,

543
00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:37.530
Penelope Cruz play Donatella sister.

544
00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:40.380
So just crazy.
All Star cast.

545
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:44.070
But the storytelling device that they use,
in other words,

546
00:35:44.071 --> 00:35:48.450
the way that they lay it out is fascinating.
It's so well done.
And I'm,

547
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:52.800
I've been so into it,
but you know,
if the show was airing now,

548
00:35:52.801 --> 00:35:56.910
so I have to wait that I went back because I'd never watched season one of

549
00:35:56.911 --> 00:35:57.870
American crime story,

550
00:35:57.871 --> 00:36:02.871
which was the Oj story and that's where they have Cuba Gooding jr playing,

551
00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:06.750
uh,
Oj and,
uh,

552
00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:11.550
John Travolta is playing a Robert Shapiro,
Robert Shapiro,

553
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:15.720
excuse me.
And Nathan Lane plays f Lee Baily.

554
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:18.630
Really good cast.
And again,
I mean it's all,

555
00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:23.660
it's much more familiar because of how high profile that story was.

556
00:36:24.031 --> 00:36:27.480
But then there's things that I'd only heard a little bit about that they,

557
00:36:27.481 --> 00:36:31.500
you know,
they,
they just lay it out really well.
It's a really,
really good,

558
00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:35.680
<v 6>yeah,
I picked up,
I was asleep,
but I saw Cuba playing Oj.
I'm like,</v>

559
00:36:35.681 --> 00:36:39.070
they didn't even try to make him look remotely like,
Oh,
Jay.
I know.

560
00:36:39.071 --> 00:36:41.620
But I think it's because he's black and white.
There's no general,

561
00:36:41.621 --> 00:36:44.580
he's a great actor.
Yeah.
So horse.
I mean Cuba is really,

562
00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.170
I mean it is only thing that's really weird about that,

563
00:36:47.171 --> 00:36:50.640
his physical stature because Cuba's small short guide.
How would you,

564
00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:54.790
he's a beast.
He's a towering,
oh,
just big dude.
Yeah,
so that,

565
00:36:54.791 --> 00:36:57.160
that part's kind of weird,
but you get over it right away.
I mean,

566
00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:58.480
the only time you ever,

567
00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:03.280
it ever makes it kind of like how your head is when he's standing around other

568
00:37:03.281 --> 00:37:08.140
guys,
you know,
and you're like,
oh,
it's not a small dude.
That story,
Dude.

569
00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:09.130
I remember I,
I,

570
00:37:09.131 --> 00:37:13.030
it was my 17th birthday and I was at a restaurant with my friends and we were

571
00:37:13.031 --> 00:37:16.960
watching Oj get chased by the cops and the White Bronco.

572
00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:21.880
It's still fresh in my mind.
That was 94 right.
And I agree.
And I was like,
dude,

573
00:37:21.881 --> 00:37:26.110
what the fuck?
That would have been 94 94 yes,
me,
my attorney,

574
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:30.450
<v 9>I was at a basketball camp at University of South Florida.</v>

575
00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:34.920
That was how,
I mean,
I remember it vividly when when the Bronco Chase happened

576
00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:37.330
<v 6>and then they covered that story,
man.</v>

577
00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:42.380
Every day on la was the biggest story that Oj murders and the killed Nicole

578
00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:47.200
Brown and Nicole Brown Simpson and the boyfriend and then Kato,
Kaitlyn.

579
00:37:47.201 --> 00:37:50.080
And then you'd see Caito down at the fucking on sunset strip.

580
00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:53.700
Up until a few years ago,
you'd see that guy at comedy shows all the time.
Yeah.

581
00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:57.010
He'd be at the saddle ranch.
She'd be around.
And you're like,
what are you doing,

582
00:37:57.011 --> 00:37:57.844
Bro?

583
00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:03.540
<v 9>Famous from murder.
Murder.
Like somebody being horrific tube.
Yeah,</v>

584
00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:08.320
definitely murdered.
Yikes.
Yeah.
But we,
but what did you say Oj is up to now?
Well,

585
00:38:08.321 --> 00:38:11.920
I mean a lot of people,
I mean I'm sure everyone remembers,
but you know,

586
00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.230
he obviously he was found not guilty.

587
00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:18.670
Then he went to prison for completely unrelated crime.
Isn't that fascinating?

588
00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:23.620
Essentially it was armed robbery of his own memorabilia.

589
00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:29.500
He did a real run in prison.
Now he's out.
And from what I understand,

590
00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.660
he's just trying to find the real killer.
You know,

591
00:38:31.661 --> 00:38:36.661
he's out there every day trying to chat that hustle and whoever killed Nicole

592
00:38:37.301 --> 00:38:38.120
and Ron Goldman.

593
00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:41.900
<v 6>My favorite was the courtroom scene when he's trying to fit the glove on his</v>

594
00:38:41.901 --> 00:38:43.540
hand.
And he's like,
ah,
I remember that.
Yeah.

595
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:53.740
<v 9>And He's struggling is so great.
And then he kind of went with it.</v>

596
00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.740
<v 6>Oh like the glove don't fit.</v>

597
00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:03.400
If the glove doesn't fit,
you must acquit.
Must acquit.
Yeah.
Yeah.

598
00:39:03.401 --> 00:39:05.530
It was crazy shit.
That was a crazy time.

599
00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:10.290
<v 9>The um,
you know,
the race card being like,</v>

600
00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:15.830
it was a total case of portraying,

601
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:20.860
you know,
using the history of the LAPD.
Yeah.

602
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:24.930
<v 6>Cause they had a bad run a couple of years earlier with Rodney.
Yeah.</v>

603
00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:28.420
Well they also had a bad run that good for the previous 40 years.
Sure,
sure,
sure,

604
00:39:28.421 --> 00:39:29.490
sure.
It was pretty bad.

605
00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:34.210
<v 9>And they use,
they played that up so brilliantly as a strategy,</v>

606
00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.760
as,
as a way to exonerate him,

607
00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:39.560
<v 6>discredit all the evidence that was collected</v>

608
00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:44.330
from the homicides.

609
00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:47.540
<v 9>It's a nightmare.
And you know,
they,</v>

610
00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:52.020
they got him doing this interview for a book where he was just dropping off.

611
00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:55.850
<v 6>Yeah.
They're like,
he's a racist clearly.
Cause he's,
you know,
saying this</v>

612
00:39:56.570 --> 00:39:57.500
<v 9>was,
they had,
you know,</v>

613
00:39:57.530 --> 00:40:02.530
had blood evidence on and in the Broncos and they were like,

614
00:40:02.811 --> 00:40:07.630
the cops planted that shit and there was enough doubt.
Those people,
they,
they,

615
00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:11.210
they played it so well and they played the long game with it.
You know,

616
00:40:11.211 --> 00:40:13.640
they didn't just go,
they did this.
It was little by little,

617
00:40:13.641 --> 00:40:16.100
they placed a little bits of doubt.
You know,

618
00:40:16.101 --> 00:40:17.570
they would talk to one of the interview,

619
00:40:17.571 --> 00:40:20.210
one of the detectives on the stand and they're like,
where do you live?

620
00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:24.260
He was like Simi Valley.
And they're like,
oh,
isn't that where the,

621
00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:28.060
the police who beat Rodney King Live,
you know,

622
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.050
so like United.

623
00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:36.500
So they just kept placing those little bits in addition to the big things.

624
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:40.910
And there was enough,
there was the best part,
the acting.

625
00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:46.480
So you think that these cops just like went out and murdered these people and

626
00:40:47.691 --> 00:40:49.940
then pinned it on Oj and they're like,
yes.

627
00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:54.400
<v 6>So crazy.
Crazy.
It was absurd.
It was absurd.
But you know,
in La,</v>

628
00:40:54.401 --> 00:40:58.630
I think if Oj had been convicted,
I think we would have had another riot.

629
00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:03.910
I think that La would have gone up in flames again cause we had just had riots

630
00:41:03.911 --> 00:41:08.110
in [inaudible] 92 or something.
Anyone I too.
And then 94 Oj.

631
00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:11.050
It was like the best thing be too much for the city.

632
00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:15.480
<v 9>Was that Oj four part documentary series?
I met that director.</v>

633
00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:21.050
It is,
but it's not a documentary like you think that's why you should watch it.

634
00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:25.310
It's not like here's the case.
It is a true,

635
00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:28.970
it's like a thesis statement.

636
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000
It is an examination of almost what's unrelated to this story to make the story

637
00:41:35.511 --> 00:41:37.010
happen.
It's fascinating.

638
00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:40.970
It's actually the best documentary I've ever seen.

639
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:45.500
I think it's called Oj in America.
It's on Netflix.
I don't think it's on Netflix.

640
00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:49.550
I think yeah,
you'd have to download or buy it somewhere.
It used to be,

641
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:54.050
um,
I think it was in conjunction with the ESPN.

642
00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:57.110
There's what I think is where it aired.
It's so good,
man.

643
00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:01.550
Some documentary or watching as it may have been.
That one,

644
00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:07.280
I caught a few minutes of it where he would stage these things that was on the

645
00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.720
dock.
Well he was,

646
00:42:08.721 --> 00:42:12.310
he was folding his American flag and crying and then he had his friend video

647
00:42:12.311 --> 00:42:16.100
tape and it was to sell,
sell that tape.

648
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:19.730
So there's a moment there,
this is not in the,
in the FX series,

649
00:42:19.731 --> 00:42:23.900
but in the documentary we're talking about,
there's a moment where he's like,

650
00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.460
wait,
I think,
um,

651
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.860
I don't know if he's been exonerated yet or,
or what,
or excuse me,

652
00:42:30.861 --> 00:42:33.740
like acquitted yet on the,
on the,
on the crime.

653
00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:35.960
But he's telling his friend and I think he's,

654
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:40.070
he knows he's asked to move out of his Brentwood house and he's lowering his

655
00:42:40.071 --> 00:42:40.641
flag.
He was like,

656
00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:45.380
stand over here and a kind of record through these bushes and then I'm going to

657
00:42:45.381 --> 00:42:49.340
pull my flag down and like,
I'm really gonna like,
you know,

658
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.860
kind of think about what I'm doing.
And he's like,

659
00:42:51.861 --> 00:42:54.410
then I'm going to notice you and be like,
come on man.
Come on.
Get out of here.

660
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:59.210
And,
and so he does this whole,
he's like watching his flag come down.

661
00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:04.260
He looks at it really meaningfully and fold it up and he puts it on.

662
00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:07.100
He was like,
oh,
come on man,
come on.
And he,

663
00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:11.420
he waves him off and it is,
and then he's like,
all right,
now take that.

664
00:43:11.421 --> 00:43:15.830
And the guys still rolling on the,
on the Cam quarter right now.
Like,

665
00:43:15.831 --> 00:43:18.910
you can go and sell that and then come back to me.
But then,

666
00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:23.570
so he was trying to get essentially like Paparazzi footage,

667
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:28.160
you know?
Yeah.
Well you listen to him talk and he's completely checked out.

668
00:43:28.161 --> 00:43:31.400
He's a complete sociopath.
He has a zero.

669
00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:35.680
He's totally disconnected from ever.
He's like,
what was that?
One more time.

670
00:43:35.681 --> 00:43:39.470
Do you ever had a gun he ever held?
He's,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I never,
no.

671
00:43:39.471 --> 00:43:41.550
He said he was never accused of killing anybody.

672
00:43:41.551 --> 00:43:43.310
You know what my favorite thing was too?

673
00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:47.240
I don't remember if this was in the documentary or not crazy for it might be in

674
00:43:47.241 --> 00:43:51.200
the doc in the documentary or it might've been something that I've saw outside

675
00:43:51.201 --> 00:43:55.550
of that when he was serving his prison sentence and for the Nevada robbery,

676
00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:57.950
they said that,
uh,
you know,

677
00:43:57.951 --> 00:44:02.790
after a few years he would come up for parole and there's a,

678
00:44:02.791 --> 00:44:05.630
a parole hearing every time for prisoners,
you know,
you sit there,

679
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:08.900
parole board sits there,
you have like your attorney,
something else.

680
00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:13.370
They would run through all the standard things,
you know,

681
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.230
your behavior.
It looks like it's this,

682
00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:19.370
I see that you've been participating in that and you've had exemplary this and

683
00:44:19.371 --> 00:44:24.050
that.
Um,
and then they would run through standardized.

684
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:27.620
In other words,
you know,
the boiler plate checklist questions.

685
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:31.530
Did you ever go to,
and they would get to,
have you ever been arrested before?

686
00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:35.980
Right.
And they had to like,
it's part of the process and he would go,
uh,
uh,

687
00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:39.720
yes.
And they were like,
why were you arrested before?

688
00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:44.170
And he would have to go,
uh,
for a double murder.

689
00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:48.290
<v 6>And they would,
they'd be like,
what were the circumstances?</v>

690
00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.000
Cause that's part of the questionnaire to call.
Right.
And then they would have,

691
00:44:51.001 --> 00:44:51.110
yeah.

692
00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:53.750
<v 9>And then he,
he would have to be like,
um,</v>

693
00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:58.810
and he would have to retell essentially the whole Oj murder trial story to the

694
00:44:59.271 --> 00:45:03.380
parole board.
And then they'd be like,
oh,
okay,
yeah,
we're not granting you parole.

695
00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:05.450
And then next year he would come back,

696
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:08.020
they'd go through the whole thing and he would do his charming.
Yeah,

697
00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:10.960
<v 6>I'm just hitting the juice.
And then they're like,</v>

698
00:45:10.961 --> 00:45:14.230
have you ever been arrested before?
And he's like,
yeah,
like one time.

699
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:18.850
What was it for?
It was for a double homicide.
And what happened?

700
00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:22.330
I didn't do it,
but uh,
yeah,
it was pretty,
it's pretty big deal.
I think.

701
00:45:22.331 --> 00:45:26.350
You know exactly what everybody knows.
Yeah.
No.
Like,
yeah,
I know.
We know.

702
00:45:26.351 --> 00:45:29.620
But you gotta tell us again.
Damn.
Isn't that unbelievable?

703
00:45:29.621 --> 00:45:33.520
He's really out of his fucking mind.
Yeah.
And that Gianni Versace,
you know,
he,

704
00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:37.180
he was right there on south beach and every time I go to south beach and you see

705
00:45:37.181 --> 00:45:39.370
the mansion there,
it's still there.
Right.
It's still there.

706
00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:41.870
But his family sold it.
Yeah,

707
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:46.850
<v 9>no,
a um,
they converted it back,
I think private a hotel.</v>

708
00:45:46.851 --> 00:45:51.380
But it's not like a hotel you can just walk up to.
It's a,
I mean,
in other words,

709
00:45:51.381 --> 00:45:55.370
you can't just see if they have a vacancy you have to book and I think you get

710
00:45:55.371 --> 00:45:58.190
the run of the whole thing.
So it's very exclusive,

711
00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:02.770
<v 6>very expensive perhaps.
It always occurred to me how,</v>

712
00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:07.120
how high profile that guy was and everybody knew him in the community.
Versace.

713
00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:10.840
Yeah.
He would just,
I mean he literally,
if you've never been to south beach,

714
00:46:10.841 --> 00:46:15.550
it's on that main drag.
What's that?
Lincoln Boulevard or ocean?
Ocean.
Ocean.
Yeah.

715
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:19.000
And you know,
he just has a couple of gates air on.
Boom.

716
00:46:19.001 --> 00:46:21.520
You're right there on the street.
And that's a major drag.

717
00:46:21.521 --> 00:46:25.240
And we're talking restaurants,
bars,
nightclubs.
Like it's,

718
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:28.650
it's the main strip there.
Yeah.
It's like living,
um,

719
00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:33.670
on sunset boulevard.
Yeah.
Tourists.
And like everything,
and no one really,

720
00:46:33.671 --> 00:46:36.270
you know,
fucking with us well until right.

721
00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:40.590
<v 9>Yeah.
But before that he was like,
he loved living there.
He had this,</v>

722
00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:46.050
it was a hotel and something neighboring and he bought them both and converted

723
00:46:46.051 --> 00:46:49.380
all into his rest or just a steak cheese if you ever,

724
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:54.710
you can look it up or Versace Miami beach home and it's kind of like a jaw

725
00:46:54.991 --> 00:46:59.610
dropper of a,
of a property.
And he would just walk down and get all his,

726
00:46:59.611 --> 00:47:01.690
they said is,
so you'd go to a,

727
00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:05.280
I think news cafe and buy magazines and newspapers in the morning and then walk

728
00:47:05.281 --> 00:47:09.060
back and people would say,
they said people would just pick,
oh,
you know,
they,

729
00:47:09.061 --> 00:47:11.370
he was the most famous resident kind of thing.

730
00:47:11.371 --> 00:47:15.210
And people would notice him say hi,
but not really bug them.

731
00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:19.380
<v 6>Yeah.
Plus it's a big gay community.
So he was a part of that,
like,
you know,</v>

732
00:47:19.381 --> 00:47:20.880
it was,
it was his community,
whatever.

733
00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:25.110
I just bums me out that John Lennon was a similar way and he got fucking price.

734
00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:30.100
Imagine John Lennon,
Jesus,
uh,
what was that place called?
It's in New York,

735
00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:34.120
<v 0>starts with a d,
the building forgot what it is.
He got shot in front of.
Yeah.</v>

736
00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:39.370
I don't remember that.
He lived in a place in yoga would go to the movies.

737
00:47:39.371 --> 00:47:43.960
Like I think in New York City people left him alone enough that he could kind of

738
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:48.990
have a normal life and not be completely flooded with fans.

739
00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:52.390
That's what it's called.
Yeah.
Until one,
you know it takes one psycho,

740
00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:57.750
which is so horrible.
Yeah,
I know.
It's really sad.
My,
yeah,

741
00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:02.960
and he was at I Versace was at the height of his fame and grind and Dex left and

742
00:48:04.211 --> 00:48:05.170
right.

743
00:48:05.171 --> 00:48:10.090
Just having knows having just huge success and the brand promise and really sad,

744
00:48:10.091 --> 00:48:13.570
you know,
he killed him in the thought.
I mean it's sad to get murdered anytime,

745
00:48:13.571 --> 00:48:14.404
but

746
00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:20.450
he just like destroyed a whole family and legacy and company all in goal.

747
00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:24.580
One moment.
That's cool.
Thanks dude.
Well was Charles topics.

748
00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:29.740
<v 11>He is a nice part for you guys.

You guys ready?
Here we go along.

751
00:48:38.411 --> 00:48:39.360
She holding it for

752
00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:45.430
Oh yeah,
that was the best part ever.

753
00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:50.600
<v 0>No I don't,
you know she talked a lot before.
We really crazy.</v>

754
00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:54.640
That was going to be something.
I don't believe that it's real is,

755
00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:59.510
I think that's real.
It just wasn't up and coming youtube up and coming.

756
00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:02.810
Who goes by the name Kai's see a I z.

757
00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:06.840
She does random videos about her day to day.
Um,

758
00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:10.430
but she also does fart videos.

759
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:14.380
She said that was the best part ever.
I just don't,
I,

760
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:15.830
it's not the best part I've seen.

761
00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:19.340
Well this is also a different standard here on the show.
We,

762
00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:24.390
we go with guys like king ass ripper.
Preferential starters.

763
00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:29.000
Yeah.
I mean this chick is fucking amateur Tuesday.

764
00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:30.260
Let's see if she steps it up.

765
00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:38.360
<v 11>She does a lot of pre</v>

766
00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:45.000
<v 0>and I wasn't that good.
See and King asked for.
So in his game,</v>

767
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:49.740
he can't talk a lot before the FARC comes.
He does the set up,

768
00:49:49.741 --> 00:49:52.050
but they're feeling,
she's trying to manipulate an audience.

769
00:49:52.051 --> 00:49:56.520
It'd be like she's trying to say,
hey,
subscribe,

770
00:49:56.521 --> 00:50:00.540
comment.
It's like,
it's like focus on your farts.

771
00:50:00.541 --> 00:50:04.920
More focus on what pays the bills.
Content content is king.

772
00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:09.750
You guys like my new fart.
Please comment down below.

Let me know what you think and please subscribe to my channel.

774
00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:18.350
But I do like
that.

775
00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:19.530
That's a better setup.

776
00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:24.000
Was she just day that says comment on my part?

777
00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:28.070
I feel like that's pretty funny the way she goes.
You like my new fart.

778
00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:33.950
I liked that too.
And I actually like the fart and then the,
the sales pitch,

779
00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:34.791
you know what I'm saying?

780
00:50:34.791 --> 00:50:39.290
Give the audience some content and then the sales pitch you my new car.

781
00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:42.950
I hope you like my new video that,
that I just put it out there.

782
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:45.890
I spent a lot of time on this guys.
I hope you like that.

783
00:50:46.170 --> 00:50:50.390
Did you like what I just did.
What happened?
Sicko.
She's not looking for dates.

784
00:50:50.391 --> 00:50:54.290
Definitely she's not looking at Yale Nus cause we keep hearing from people that

785
00:50:54.291 --> 00:50:59.020
want to talk to us about their,
their farts.
The far fetish.
I don't know.

786
00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:01.640
I know we've been getting to know people.
I could talk to you about it,

787
00:51:01.641 --> 00:51:05.500
but I think I get it.
I get it.
I don't even mean to do an interview about it.

788
00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:09.030
I don't need to go in depth.
I feel like we understand.

789
00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.850
The one guy told us one time,

790
00:51:10.851 --> 00:51:13.740
I forget we were somewhere in Texas and the guy goes,
yeah,

791
00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:17.990
what's exciting to me is the pretty girl in the dirty thing.

792
00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:25.910
But also because of that whole,
you know,
I think it happens in childhood,

793
00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:29.720
but guys here more like girls don't fart and stuff like that,
you know,

794
00:51:29.721 --> 00:51:33.320
because guys are encouraged to be gross,
but then they're like,

795
00:51:33.321 --> 00:51:38.321
but you know the girls aren't so some little boys at a certain point it actually

796
00:51:38.331 --> 00:51:41.150
probably think,
oh girls don't fart

797
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:48.833
so dumb

798
00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:54.170
all the time with my dad glasses on.

799
00:51:57.420 --> 00:51:59.490
But could you imagine being married to someone?

800
00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:08.000
You don't Fart for a few months,
the beginning,

801
00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:13.640
oops.
And then you're like,
Hey,
I'm going to really let it rip now.

802
00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:21.540
Yeah.
But I feel like lately I've been farting

803
00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:26.630
and then you fart.
You push it out to you.

804
00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:30.510
We've definitely been showing me up lately.
I mean,
I think there's pregnancy is,

805
00:52:30.511 --> 00:52:34.460

806
00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:36.700

808
00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:42.933
Yeah.

809
00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:47.180
Cj's definitely cooking the jams with you.

810
00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:51.080
You know what's great is that our son has finally picked up on how disgusting we

811
00:52:51.081 --> 00:52:54.320
are.
He's been looking for boogers and

812
00:52:56.510 --> 00:53:01.340
we've been teaching them all that good stuff.
Boobies,
boobies,
brokers.

813
00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:06.530
He points at your belly is his baby this morning he pointed at mine and said,

Cute little kid.

Think about my fart comment.

818
00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:30.030
Think about my cycle.

819
00:53:30.031 --> 00:53:34.850
This is Christina's dad is singing.

In those days</v>

822

823
00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:50.810
<v 0>Sayville saying save alive.
I was trying to say staying alive.</v>

824
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:55.850
Oh Huh.
Huh.
His teeth look great.
Yeah.
All five of those.

825
00:53:55.851 --> 00:53:57.100
Those are all good.

826
00:53:57.460 --> 00:53:58.350
<v 12>Uh Huh.</v>

827
00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:11.570
<v 0>That's good.
I don't know how this got in here.
I really don't.
I like,</v>

828
00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:13.080
I know like I lie.

829
00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:17.500
You think your dad recorded himself then send it in to blue man.
Yeah.
Yeah,

830
00:54:17.530 --> 00:54:20.690
definitely.
That's it.
My Dad loves to go on the desert and just sing.
Hmm.

831
00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:25.490
What an interesting background choice to sit in like desert rocks and this guy

832
00:54:25.491 --> 00:54:29.890
is really doing it.
He's had a lot of sun,
a lot of other things to it.
Yeah.

833
00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:33.580
I don't think son is his biggest concern,
but um,

834
00:54:34.610 --> 00:54:38.450
man that has,
he's probably lived a full life.
Yeah.

835
00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:41.000
So you think this is his go to song all the time.

836
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:43.070
So the person would be cameras like to staying alive again.

837
00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:44.960
He loves staying alive.
Yeah.
This is jam.

838
00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:50.150
And the way that he does it leads me to think that it's his,
his,
uh,
you know,

839
00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:55.910
his performance thing where yeah.
Says go to jam.
Yeah.

840
00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:58.340
Oh,
that's a nice teeth.
So yeah,

841
00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:02.020
<v 12>you're the base data.
You guys did it.
We made it</v>

842
00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:08.450
and I went,
oh,
I'm by.
No,
no.
Watch Damon.

843
00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:10.060
Go and buy those days dad.

844
00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:14.990
So that your name is Diane [inaudible].

845
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:16.023
Okay.

846
00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:20.950
<v 0>Ooh.
Flew those teeth.
Yeah,
that's crazy.
There's one,
two,
three,
four,
four,
five.</v>

847
00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:24.940
There's five.
Yeah.
Is that four or five?
No,
that's fine.

848
00:55:24.941 --> 00:55:27.920
There's a chicklet in the back.
God Damn.
Damn.

849
00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:33.580
Oh see I was seeing a one,
two,
three,

850
00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:38.830
four,
five,
five.
Yeah.
Stumps.
You can,
you can do a lot with five teeth.

851
00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:43.390
You wrap everything about that.
You can't do a lot.
You can do a lot.

852
00:55:43.391 --> 00:55:47.810
Five's a lot of detail.
It's fine.
You can bite into almost anything with five t.

853
00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:52.560
Well shit,
I'm in.
Our baby had five.
They're on the pureed stuff.
He can't give.

854
00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:55.810
You can give it a cleaning basket.
It's not what you want.
Yeah.

855
00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:59.180
I think you want more,
but I think five is plenty.
Yeah,

856
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:05.200
five too many.
Huh?
You don't need them,
you know one,
one is really

857
00:56:06.790 --> 00:56:10.090
is the minimum of what you need.
I know that's obvious,

858
00:56:10.091 --> 00:56:14.320
but once you're in the fire,
this guy basically has access teeth.
He could donate,

859
00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:16.760
here's what you need.
You need Maulers.
Yeah.

860
00:56:16.770 --> 00:56:21.550
You really only need those molars and the front teeth to bite stuff as actually

861
00:56:21.551 --> 00:56:24.950
like if you had to do the like a a minimal layout.
Yeah,

862
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:28.960
I would say ideally to here.
Yeah.
And then yeah,

863
00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:33.070
a colon Waller's that's it.
That's kind of it.
Cause the rest of them like do you,

864
00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:37.390
you don't really chew a lot with like at the vampire teeth and with these here I

865
00:56:37.391 --> 00:56:41.050
feel like they're kind of a necessary and then it's a matter of do you feel like

866
00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:43.760
this is what the look you want or not?
Well,
definitely it's luck.

867
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:49.783
<v 12>Ooh.</v>

868
00:56:57.790 --> 00:56:59.320
<v 0>What do you think smells worse?</v>

869
00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:05.920
His mouth or his asshole.
Oh,
mouth hundred percent.
1000%.

870
00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:10.240
There's all types of decay.
You know,
his asshole isn't decaying,
it's just shitty.

871
00:57:10.241 --> 00:57:14.800
But this has active bacteria,
um,

872
00:57:15.010 --> 00:57:18.040
things that are rotting in and around the mouth.
Yeah,
it's bad.

873
00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:19.960
It's not good at all.
It's really bad.

874
00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:25.540
How much do French spells like sick sickness and death?
How much the French him?

875
00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:29.200
No.
Yeah.
I would get,
I would tip him if he sang that song though.

876
00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:34.060
That's a real bummer.
He made up a lot of the words she made up all of them.

877
00:57:34.061 --> 00:57:38.470
But even staying alive wasn't right.
Cause what did he call it?
Same.
Same.

878
00:57:38.471 --> 00:57:40.620
The mom.
I don't know.
It was nuts.

879
00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:43.373
<v 12>Damn.</v>

880
00:57:45.450 --> 00:57:48.660
<v 0>Save a life.
Save.
Align.
Why is he saying save a life?</v>

881
00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:51.320
<v 12>Okay.
Is there United way United States United States</v>

882
00:57:54.830 --> 00:57:56.850
say even line.

883
00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:03.040
<v 0>No.
Sorry.
The line's stable line.
You've got the sound of it.
Write the melody.</v>

884
00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:08.040
Yeah.
Rice video.
By the way,

885
00:58:08.041 --> 00:58:10.040
it's labeled using login.

886
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:13.170
It says

887
00:58:22.450 --> 00:58:24.070
<v 15>the video title is.</v>

888
00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:26.843
<v 11>Oh,</v>

889
00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:30.423
<v 3>okay.</v>

890
00:58:32.930 --> 00:58:33.763
<v 11>Tell me.</v>

891
00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:46.090
I'm going to pee too.

892
00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:50.350
<v 15>Is using long infection like insurance.</v>

893
00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:52.510
<v 3>Okay.</v>

894
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:57.190
<v 15>Wait.
Using lung and get some more like an instrument.</v>

895
00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:01.020
That's the name of this.

896
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:03.583
<v 12>Yeah.</v>

897
00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:12.533
<v 3>Oh,</v>

898
00:59:44.170 --> 00:59:45.460
<v 0>the back of my head hurts.</v>

899
00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:58.180
I think blue band titled it that.
That's the funniest.

900
00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:03.540
That's the hardest you've ever made me laugh.
Blue Band.
God Damn Dude.

901
01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:08.130
So nasty.
He named me.
He names the files.

902
01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.210
Yes.
Yes.
This first one's called

903
01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:13.950
<v 5>staying alive.
This one's called closer.
Look at</v>

904
01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:18.940
this one.
He's got red though.

905
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:22.190
And this is called using the lung infection

906
01:00:29.850 --> 01:00:30.683
man

907
01:00:53.010 --> 01:00:54.140
<v 0>lung infection.</v>

908
01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:02.230
Dingleberry ms,
I can't read.
Hold on.
Dingleberry mishap.

909
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:03.150
Hey jeans.

910
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:06.620
<v 6>So I was recently taken a massive brown at Chili's.</v>

911
01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:09.170
I thought I shook all my dingles out,

912
01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.810
but when I stood up to grab some toilet paper,

913
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:14.540
a Barry plugged in my underwear and splattered.

914
01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:18.740
How do I go upon living my shitty life after this brown incident?

915
01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:22.220
Most importantly,
what would this even be called?
Try it out.
Piss on me.

916
01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.113
<v 0>Dylan.</v>

917
01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:27.030
<v 6>Dingleberry like you said,</v>

918
01:01:27.031 --> 01:01:30.120
a piece of shit landed in his underwear is what he's saying.

919
01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:35.780
<v 0>I guess that's what it beat me.
Try it out.
Try it out.
Try it out.
Um,</v>

920
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:40.560
yeah,
I dunno.
The Dingle Berry plopped in his underwear.

921
01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:43.590
When I wipe our son's ass,
that happens all the time.

922
01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:47.460
Like a piece of shit will fly into the clean diaper or the dirty diaper.
Yeah,

923
01:01:48.930 --> 01:01:53.070
I mean
I just feel like you got it.
You know,
you got to start doing,

924
01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:57.930
you got to take those wet wipes with you.
The worst thing ever.

925
01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:02.940
Once you have optimum clean asshole at home?
Yeah,

926
01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:07.290
like we do with a day or the water.
What is it?

927
01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:08.250
The water.

928
01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:13.250
There's a name Washlet washlet once you have that and you have this just premium

929
01:02:14.821 --> 01:02:18.690
asshole,
you realize that in public you're fucking,

930
01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.730
you're an that's disgusting.

931
01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:24.840
<v 9>And you know,
I do think sometimes it's like,
I'll try to wet paper.</v>

932
01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:30.890
I was working out yesterday at the gym and I had tucked us the sauciness

933
01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:36.100
sloppiest dump and I was in there as much a flush six times on the clean up.

934
01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.850
It's a small gym.
They're like,

935
01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:40.710
<v 6>you should there.
Why don't you just come home?</v>

936
01:02:40.711 --> 01:02:44.730
We live around the corner because I was about to start with the beginning.
Sorry,

937
01:02:44.731 --> 01:02:45.450
I didn't realize.

938
01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:48.720
<v 9>So yeah,
I just was like fuck.
And I just kept,</v>

939
01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:53.430
I mean I would walk over to the sink,
wet paper towels clean.

940
01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:54.323
It was horrible.

941
01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:58.720
<v 6>It's a lost cause you got to just throw in the towel and shower at that point.</v>

942
01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:02.250
I know,
but it was,
you know,
I just got there and I was getting rid of,
you can't,

943
01:03:02.330 --> 01:03:06.670
no,
I'm just saying if you were home I just fucking shower.
Yeah.

944
01:03:06.671 --> 01:03:08.440
I mean I would suggest doing,

945
01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:14.740
we're Tom said getting some wipes or just get yourself the word pushy or

946
01:03:14.741 --> 01:03:15.574
something like that.

947
01:03:15.790 --> 01:03:20.710
They sell the walk around once for like when you go out they sell a pouch with

948
01:03:20.770 --> 01:03:24.120
like five.
Yeah.
God,
it's not a bad idea bro.
Okay.

949
01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:28.780
<v 9>Pack them before cause they send us some,
um,
I forget who it was.</v>

950
01:03:28.810 --> 01:03:32.650
I think it was a,
what's it called?
Dollar Shave Club.
Yeah,
they make a good one.

951
01:03:32.890 --> 01:03:35.380
So I,
I packed them once and they are great,

952
01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:37.780
but yet you'd have to get in the habit of bringing it with you,

953
01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:40.960
but it's really necessary.
Yeah.

954
01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:44.080
Otherwise you've just have a dirty ass hole and you have

955
01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:49.040
<v 6>no,
I would suggest first of all,
if you can put yourself on a doot schedule.</v>

956
01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:51.560
Yeah,
that's what I mean,
pregnancy aside.

957
01:03:51.590 --> 01:03:55.910
And what I like to do is I wake up in the morning,
I have my cup of coffee and I,

958
01:03:55.911 --> 01:03:59.750
it's like fucking brown lightning.
Yeah.
I'd take a shit.
And then I shower.

959
01:03:59.751 --> 01:04:04.460
I go straight from the toilet to the shower.
But this is what this is about.

960
01:04:04.461 --> 01:04:07.430
What happens when you're not home?
Yeah,
I know,
but I don't take,

961
01:04:07.550 --> 01:04:12.200
I try not to take shits in strange places.
I know you said,

962
01:04:12.310 --> 01:04:16.850
you know,
this is like sometimes it happens,
sometimes it does.
But you know,
fuck.

963
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.540
Let me ask you this.
Can you kick my ass?

964
01:04:22.090 --> 01:04:26.230
<v 9>Um,
so here's a question.</v>

965
01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:31.510
You're a prostitute.
Yup.
What is,
it's work,
you know,

966
01:04:31.511 --> 01:04:34.720
it's not just doing the,
it's not just the sex act.

967
01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:38.500
It's really about how do you have your business growth.
In other words,

968
01:04:38.501 --> 01:04:43.501
what is your sales pitch when a gentleman drives up and you're a street walker.

969
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:47.320
Okay.
What would you say as far as like,

970
01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:50.510
<v 6>you like big tits?
Yeah.
That's kind of go with your mom.</v>

971
01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:54.300
Like I would go with what stands out most about me.
Okay.
Let's put,

972
01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.450
I am pulling up.
Yeah.
Looking out the window.

973
01:04:56.451 --> 01:05:00.650
Maybe you liked these quadruple d tits.
Yeah.
Well come on.

974
01:05:00.651 --> 01:05:03.220
You and you want to take a ride on these tits.

975
01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:08.240
20 $20 I don't know what the rate is.
Let's go over again.
Your car.

976
01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:10.790
How much I know.
I wouldn't tell him the money up front.
Never.

977
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.890
Never go with price up front.
You have to,
what do you mean you have to,

978
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:16.310
you have to sell the guy.
If the guy wants to know,
he's like,
how much is it?

979
01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:21.940
Oh boy.
He says,
how much you want to come on these tits?
$20 wow.

980
01:05:21.941 --> 01:05:25.900
That's a good deal,
right?
Yeah.
Great.
And that's how I lure him in.
Well,
great.

981
01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:29.560
Let's go to the hotel around the corner or wherever you do your business.

982
01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:30.581
That's what I would do.

983
01:05:30.581 --> 01:05:34.600
I would lure him in with the $20 come on my tits and then I would up the ante

984
01:05:34.601 --> 01:05:37.330
once we're in the room.
That's how you shark.
I'm old baby.

985
01:05:37.331 --> 01:05:41.960
You want to get inside this virgin?
I'm pregnant.
That's a specialty item too.

986
01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:45.580
That's true.
Then I would,
you know,
then I would bring him through the menu,

987
01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:50.110
but 20 is 20 is the entry point because that's not going to make it good.

988
01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:52.240
You gotta you gotta be,
you know,

989
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:55.630
you have to be willing to do something for that 20 he's going to come on my
tits.

990
01:05:57.190 --> 01:06:00.550
That's not enough.
No,
that's great.
That's great.
For some guys,
that's a big deal.

991
01:06:01.330 --> 01:06:04.130
I'm not arguing with you.
So here's another pitch.
I'm just going to,

992
01:06:04.330 --> 01:06:06.420
I was getting your pitch to show you a pitch.
Oh,
okay.

993
01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:14.950
<v 15>Chuck on the gang.</v>

994
01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:22.900
<v 6>Wow.
She rehearsed that line down.
I wish I will.</v>

995
01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:24.650
Here's what I will critique on her performance.

996
01:06:24.651 --> 01:06:27.890
If we're going to go for like an American idol kind of thing right now or the

997
01:06:27.891 --> 01:06:29.960
voice.
I didn't lie.

998
01:06:29.961 --> 01:06:32.750
I didn't believe her because she was too dead behind the eyes.

999
01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:37.200
I feel like maybe her spirit is broken away from,

1000
01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:41.660
I would have liked to feel more of a connection to her performance,

1001
01:06:41.810 --> 01:06:45.080
but I like the,
now you're speaking as a casting director,
right?

1002
01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:48.180
This is as a performer,
performer,
performer.
Then the guy,

1003
01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:50.360
he liked that pitch as much.
She asked her to say it again.

1004
01:06:53.590 --> 01:06:58.590
<v 15>I got that deep like the ass lick the balls with that weight on my throat.</v>

1005
01:06:59.130 --> 01:07:03.450
Choke on a Gig on a catchy slogan.
The 460 how can I just use the APP

1006
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:07.310
that's on in there?
How many show on the street?

1007
01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:13.490
<v 6>Oh wait,
you're on the street is 20 she does that for 20 bucks in the street.</v>

1008
01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:17.330
Right?
She's like,
if I meet you on the streets,
$20 no,
I wouldn't.

1009
01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:21.320
I wouldn't go that low for a blow job.
No Way.
No Way.

1010
01:07:21.321 --> 01:07:24.800
She said she swallows it too for half dollars.
No Dude,

1011
01:07:25.010 --> 01:07:29.480
no man.
No,
no,
no,
no.

1012
01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:34.490
That's pretty wild.
But I do like the rhythm of the,

1013
01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:38.520
I got that porno star had I do the thing of is done like that.
Well,

1014
01:07:38.550 --> 01:07:41.840
you could also wrap your menu.
You know what I'm saying,

1015
01:07:41.841 --> 01:07:45.700
$20 for a street blowjob.
$40 to take it in the hotel.

1016
01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:48.680
$60 to get my anal $8 for the round the world.

1017
01:07:48.681 --> 01:07:52.280
Whatever you could work on wrapping your filet of fish.
You know what I mean?

1018
01:07:52.281 --> 01:07:55.860
Like that old Mcdonald's wrapped quarter pounder flivver and McDonald's,
it Dah,

1019
01:07:55.861 --> 01:07:56.200
Dah,
Dah.

1020
01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:59.330
You have it all laid out and the guy can pick what he wants from that menu.

1021
01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:01.850
But I feel like that's how you low ball yourself.

1022
01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:04.640
Cause this cheap mother fucker is always going to pick the lowest.
Sure.

1023
01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:07.660
The key is to get them somewhere else.
And then upsell.

1024
01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:11.690
We learned that from the cat.
What's that fucking Cat Rach?

1025
01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:16.190
What's that fucking dumb show?
Dennis?
The F the Douche bag

1026
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:20.840
<v 0>where the teeth cat cat house.
Yeah.
That,</v>

1027
01:08:20.841 --> 01:08:21.620
those,

1028
01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:26.270
those slots were so smart they would get the guy in the room and it was,

1029
01:08:26.271 --> 01:08:29.280
well here's the menu already.
Yeah,
yeah.

1030
01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.570
And then she give him the laminated menu.
Right.

1031
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:37.820
Well baby for $20 I can touch it,
but for $40 you could put it in my,

1032
01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:42.710
you know?
Yeah.
And then the best would be the guy be like,
man,

1033
01:08:42.711 --> 01:08:47.510
I would see this.
The uh,
just the emotion where the guy was like,
yes.

1034
01:08:47.770 --> 01:08:51.020
And she's like,
great.
So then with that kind of party,

1035
01:08:51.021 --> 01:08:55.070
it's 200 and then for this it's 800 yeah.
And then he's like,
well,

1036
01:08:55.071 --> 01:08:59.310
I just kind of want to,
you know,
shutting your mouth,
put it in.

1037
01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:04.520
Okay,
so that's $1,200 she's like,
um,
and you could see him and be like,

1038
01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:10.520
sit in the hot tub.
She's like,
yeah,
that's $400 all right.
And then he'd be like,

1039
01:09:10.521 --> 01:09:12.710
I thought I have,
and she'd be like,
cool,
we can sit in the hot tub.

1040
01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:17.180
We should know.
And she would get like $400 for the guy to be like,
yeah,

1041
01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:20.700
you got nice tits.
Yeah.
The best part too is data.

1042
01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:24.720
Always take the credit card before any party happened.
Smart goal.

1043
01:09:24.721 --> 01:09:29.060
If he goes like,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Then the credit card,
I'll be right back.

1044
01:09:29.650 --> 01:09:31.400
Wait here baby,
take her clothes off or whatever.

1045
01:09:31.401 --> 01:09:35.270
And then she would take the credit card to the Madam.
The MME would rang it up,

1046
01:09:35.271 --> 01:09:38.330
make sure the credit card was good.
Okay baby.
We're all ready to go.

1047
01:09:38.331 --> 01:09:41.300
And then there was a timer.
Remember you got 30 minutes,
let's go.

1048
01:09:41.301 --> 01:09:44.870
Let's party dirty.
And then,
yeah,
if they wanted longer,
great.

1049
01:09:44.871 --> 01:09:47.060
Give me your credit card again.
And then she'd go out.

1050
01:09:47.061 --> 01:09:52.061
Always get the money before the trends I saw when I was home and I did the same

1051
01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:56.750
thing.
What's your pitch?
Um,
I'd be like,
uh,
you like,

1052
01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:00.620
uh,
circumcise Cox and common balls.

1053
01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:04.690
I got it.
Um,

1054
01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:08.210
it's not going to last long,
but you know,

1055
01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:12.650
like showered today.
You want it?
It's hot.
Yeah.

1056
01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:17.420
Well you would appeal to the bear,
the bear loving demographic.
You're a bear.

1057
01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:22.870
I'm scared.
Oh my God.
They wouldn't tear you apart,
those guys.
I know.

1058
01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:28.210
Jeez.
I'd be like,
I'm a new cub.
Yeah.
Right.

1059
01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:35.330
Yeah,
right.
They'd be like,
yeah,
you're ready now.

1060
01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:41.450
Oh.
And uh,
that would be,
it would be a lot.

1061
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:44.930
I would be pretty skin.
Should be.
Yeah.

1062
01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:47.793
<v 18>Okay.</v>

1063
01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:52.380
<v 0>That's a mess.
That's a genius.
Yeah.</v>

1064
01:10:56.270 --> 01:11:00.860
I think all that stuff's just going to be so painful.
I think so too,

1065
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:05.170
but stuff,
you know.
Jeez.
All right,

Um,
we got to split.

1066
01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:08.090
Yup.

1068
