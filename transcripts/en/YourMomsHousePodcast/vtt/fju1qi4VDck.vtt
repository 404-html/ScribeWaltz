A guy hold on the like the one 800 number for that.

5
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.260
You know the accurate Jeffrey Dean Morgan sausages.

6
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.640
He has a 800 number where I guess people can leave a message.

7
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.130
I left him a message where he's really upset.

8
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.940
The size sauce,
Huh?

Over a hundred times.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.300
Take a 12 and a couple of the other night and I ain't going to work and I'm not

amazing.
Yeah.
Paid money.
They have money.

24
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.350
<v 3>Michael and sage.
That was a Ramsey.</v>

25
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.340
We always have fucking,
we definitely have,
I mean,

26
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.410
that's Ramsay McQueen with a Jimmy Dean.
I like how he hates the maple and sage.

27
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.060
I hate that shit to do.
You do.
He's,
he's saying that that's a,
that's a northern,

28
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.510
yeah,
that's a northern uppity.
Well,
he right about that.
Yeah.

29
00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.990
I don't like fancy either.
I agree.
You know,
I don't like

30
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.610
<v 4>that gay shit.
Oh,
I agree.
I don't think that gay shit either.
And you know,</v>

31
00:03:04.611 --> 00:03:06.130
and even as trader's Joe,

32
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.670
they have these fancy fucking sausages like chicken and dilly with the chunks

33
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.850
apple in there.
It's fucking nasty dude.
Nasty,
nasty.

34
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:19.630
Like you gotta be so nasty all the time.
I agree.
I like just like,

35
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.380
I want it to salty in Greece and then I don't like that.
The road,

36
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:26.080
the herbs and the Natha

37
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.960
classics now kind of makes me feel like,

38
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.410
oh,
the board is bad.

39
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.580
Finally.
I know.
God Damn,
we've been

40
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.660
AA being leg you like mile back
someone.

41
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.620
Yay.
Yay.
Yay Back.
It's back,
man.

42
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.380
Yeah.
I feel like,
I feel like it's a long time.
We,

43
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.330
oh my God.
I feel like my dog is back from the groomers.
No,

44
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:11.320
we had the sound engineer come in and we had a great guy,

45
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:13.150
Scott came and uh,

46
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.330
oddly enough new this space isn't that bananas really create the story.

47
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:23.260
So I was at flappers doing shows and Scott comes up to me and he goes,

48
00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:27.520
hey,
he's,
he works at flappers.
Right?
He goes,
hey,
just see a,
just,
you know,

49
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.300
I know the person who owned the house before you.
I know that studio.

50
00:04:31.301 --> 00:04:34.570
I'm the sound engineer that worked for the guy that owned the compose.

51
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.020
Beautiful music composed.
Yeah.
Yeah.

52
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.960
Like scored so many movies in this room.
I couldn't believe it.
I could,

53
00:04:40.961 --> 00:04:43.450
he gave me his card and I immediately gave it too.

54
00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:45.070
Cause I know we've been having issues and Gourd,

55
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.800
wonderful music to beautiful films.
And now you guys are like,

56
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.720
yeah.
So yeah,
you gave me his contact.
Yeah,

57
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.750
I called him and he came out here and he helped solve the mystery.

58
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.360
God Damn.
Yeah.
Now wait,
hold on.

59
00:05:01.361 --> 00:05:05.950
Back to this meat flavored meet discussion.
Now the one caveat,

60
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.260
uh,
yeah.
Okay,

61
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:11.890
now you're just showing off because in the last episode I had a really big burp.

62
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.510
Okay.
I'm a really big bite.

63
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.760
So now here's my one thing I like and have really big bite.
I really like,
uh,

64
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.470
I like whole foods seasoned to bacon that we'd been getting lately.
Yeah,

65
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.180
that's really good.
They have the Jalapeno garlic.

66
00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:30.440
It's unbelievable now that they do at home.

67
00:05:30.441 --> 00:05:33.070
[inaudible] that's what they do right there at the butcher.
Does it,

68
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.400
I don't know if they do it right there cause sometimes I don't have it.

69
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.060
And I ask them,
where's the flavored bacon?
And then he says,

70
00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:43.180
well we have the bacon in the back,
but we haven't seasoned it yet.
And I go,

71
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.750
oh fucking chop chop bro.
Yeah,
get on it dude.
I got you.
Got,

72
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.760
you got time to fucking put on that hat.
You can't fucking season the bacon.
Well,

73
00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:55.930
now that I got a 12 year old girl to feed,
I've got a heavy scotch woman.

74
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.980
I noticed that that guy kept saying the name wrong.
It's

75
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.820
<v 3>Jeffrey Dean Morgan,
right?
Sausages.
Jeffrey Dean Morgan.</v>

76
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:05.623
Yeah.

77
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.800
You're in a awfully good mood today.
Why is that?
Oh No.
Why is that Bobby?

78
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.060
I Dunno,
Trish,

79
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.070
was it Trish last night or Karen that came out?
Oh No,
it was,
it was,
uh,

80
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.600
it was,
uh,
Trish night.
Yeah.

81
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.130
How do you know the difference now between,
uh,
she doesn't take a lot.

82
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.160
Karen and Trish does shut back a lot to figure it out more with Trish.

83
00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:42.040
Girl was out.
Hey.
Hey,

84
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.540
did you wire tap our rooms?
Yeah.
Yeah.

85
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.810
It was fun.
Gosh,
it was fun.
You're like,
you know,

86
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.090
you're a p I g I had to get fucked up.
You know,

87
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.330
I had to drink a whole bottle of Thunderbird and then I can do it with you.

88
00:06:58.331 --> 00:06:58.850
It was okay.

89
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.680
<v 5>Oh,</v>

90
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:05.320
<v 6>Ooh.
I want to love you.
P.
I g pretty young pig.</v>

91
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.640
<v 3>Yeah,
it's fun.
It was that,
is that what that song was about?
I want to love u p.</v>

92
00:07:12.641 --> 00:07:17.380
I.
G.
Yeah,
that's what it's about.
Should we do a proper show open?

93
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.770
Oh yeah.
Deputy Dean.
No,
my boards back.
Oh my gosh.
Oh,

94
00:07:21.771 --> 00:07:26.350
have you got a bad bite?
Got a bad back and bite.
All right,
here we go.

95
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:31.720
Show is rolling.
Let's do this.
Sound good or bad?

96
00:07:31.721 --> 00:07:32.554
Bite

97
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.810
<v 2>bleeding all over my vagina.
All over this.</v>

98
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.560
So get the fuck off so I can get off the plane.

99
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.240
<v 1>Well,
welcome to your mom's house.</v>

100
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.320
Christina.
Pushes.
It's interesting.

101
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.190
It's really good.

102
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:16.220
The base,

103
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.300
uh,
real

104
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.290
<v 3>quick before I forget,</v>

105
00:08:43.291 --> 00:08:48.190
a lot of people enjoyed and then a lot of people complained about the live

106
00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:52.650
podcast that went up.
No boy.
Um,
here's what I can tell you,
man.

107
00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:55.200
I had no problem playing it on.
I,
I,

108
00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.090
I listened to it on the podcast APP on my phone.
Sounded totally normal.

109
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.580
Um,
wasn't to it on iTunes.

110
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:06.750
Sounded totally normal to me and I noticed that all the comments were back and

111
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:07.231
forth.
I mean,

112
00:09:07.231 --> 00:09:09.750
would it be like you can't hear it and the next person would say you can hear it

113
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:12.360
fine.
Here's all I can tell you.
Um,

114
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:17.540
it's the file that we got from them and I've sent it now,

115
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:18.910
which is I guess too late,

116
00:09:18.911 --> 00:09:22.470
but I sent it to another engineer to see if they can do some type of treatment

117
00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:25.800
on it,
see if they can fix it and I'll re upload it.

118
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:30.660
I'm waiting on that answer also for the late show with Yoshi.
So if they can,

119
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.800
if they can,
you know,
make it any better,
I'll,

120
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:39.720
I will gladly pay for that.
And then upload it.
Then,
um,
that's,

121
00:09:39.721 --> 00:09:40.610
that's where it's at.
I,

122
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.730
I had got so many messages that said it's fine and then the other people would

123
00:09:44.731 --> 00:09:47.310
be like,
it's not,
I can't hear a thing.
I don't know what to tell you.

124
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.880
So it's weird that that many people are,
you know,

125
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.870
having conflicting issues with it.
But who knows?
Jean,

126
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.710
I don't know what to tell you.
I have to wait.
We'll just wait.
We'll just see.

127
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.370
Gosh,
I'm so thirsty.
Let me see if I have my water.
Oh,
I do.

128
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.780
It's right here.
It's called liquid.
Not as good as evo.

129
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.820
So much better than CVS.

130
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.560
You may have noticed I sabotaged your CV and I put in all the qual.

131
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.790
I did notice.
Wait till you see with arriving at the house later though,

132
00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.120
that shit,
it is the mother lode of z.

133
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.350
Where do you even get these disgusting drinks?
Over 80 cans coming.

134
00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:28.600
Shut the front door.
Where do you get them?
On Amazon.
Yeah.
Yeah.

135
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:32.970
Using your mom's house,
podcasts.
Dotcom,
banner.
Click on it.

136
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.490
Disgusting ass flavors.
Did you get?
Um,
I learned,
I realized that I didn't,

137
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.610
I'm not as in the grape,
so,
oh,

138
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:45.500
one thing I like my favorite ones.
The cream soda.
That's okay.
Oh,

139
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.380
I liked that one.

140
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.030
I got the Black Cherry tree and I got some doctors.
Eve.

141
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.530
Yes.
I do like the grape though.
I wish you to up that.
Great.

142
00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.400
Okay.
I didn't know you never mentioned it.
You were always like,
oh yeah,

143
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.340
so that's why I didn't do it.
If you would have said it,
I would've done it.

144
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.580
I want to squish your balls like that video.
We,
boy,

145
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:13.930
we've been watching that a lot.
So to everybody too.
I sent it to Ron.

146
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:18.440
I haven't talked to him on in a year and he just sent me one of those,
uh,

147
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:23.580
was a Gif is actually Jif,
but yeah.
Yeah.
You're supposed to say Jeff,

148
00:11:23.581 --> 00:11:28.581
but I swear to you who's saying that the guy that invented that code,

149
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.530
well then he should have put a jug.
A Jay.
Yeah.
Jay.

150
00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:35.880
I APP is a Jif Gif is GI.
If we learned this on fucking sesame street,

151
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:41.430
I'm not debating it.
I just know that read all about the discussion about it and,

152
00:11:41.431 --> 00:11:43.980
and it basically is like,
it's 100% Jeff,

153
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:49.080
but the world has said fuck you to his request.

154
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.520
So yeah.
Well,
okay,
then again,
I,
you know,
I should have been in a j tell,

155
00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:54.443
you're like,
well,

156
00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:57.570
<v 4>you know,
I got to tell you.
Well,
you know,
it's,</v>

157
00:11:57.571 --> 00:12:00.940
it's like you're going to demand that we all say it the wrong way.
It's a,

158
00:12:00.941 --> 00:12:05.350
it's a irrational want.
Sorry,
I don't know your fucking Pronoun.

159
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.250
You know what I mean?
He's demanding.
I call,

160
00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.710
I call him Zinzer and I don't even know it.
I don't want,
you know,

161
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:17.530
by the way,
he's fucking cunts.
Okay.

162
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.520
What with the video?
We haven't talked about the video.
We'll video that.

163
00:12:21.521 --> 00:12:25.330
We've been watching.
Stop.
Let's not get off track too,
right?
You're right,

164
00:12:25.331 --> 00:12:28.570
you're right.
But don't forget,
put a,
put a pin in it.

165
00:12:28.571 --> 00:12:32.350
As they say in the corporate world,
like Mike,
we'll circle back later.

166
00:12:32.351 --> 00:12:35.640
Circle back.
Think outside the box if you don't mind.
And

167
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.680
God damn,
I hate all that stuff.
It's so oppressive.

168
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.160
So my Cronin's sent me this,
you know,

169
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:51.010
the ten second video and I opened it and it's shows an apartment complex on fire

170
00:12:52.091 --> 00:12:53.890
and you're like,
oh,
okay,
what's going to happen here?

171
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:59.340
And then it jump cuts to a lady kicking a guy in the balls naked and then

172
00:13:01.031 --> 00:13:03.280
punching him in the balls and then,

173
00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:07.240
and then kneeing him in the balls and then it ends with her grabbing his ball

174
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.580
and lifting him up by them.
And they're enormous.

175
00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:13.210
But it's also edited to Jitterbug by Wham.

176
00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:17.410
It'll wake me up before you go.
Yeah Dude,
a bug,

177
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.350
right.
Wake me up.

178
00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:29.500
Um,
and they also add the editing is phenomenal.

179
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:33.460
And then when she grabs his balls and lift him up,
it's when the horn goes.

180
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.860
So it matches that.

181
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.083
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

182
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:39.750
<v 4>Great.
It's really great.</v>

183
00:13:39.751 --> 00:13:43.390
We can't play it on the show because the audio gets flagged,

184
00:13:43.391 --> 00:13:47.460
the video will get flagged,
everything gets fucking flagged.
Fucking flags,

185
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.460
flags,
flag in your ass.

186
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.290
Tell him they tell him,

187
00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:59.070
but I can't get over is the perfect music that goes with it.

188
00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:02.070
And how large that man's balls are.
His balls.

189
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.170
I'm sure we've talked about this before.
I'm not against anyone's kinks.
I'm like,

190
00:14:07.171 --> 00:14:08.004
whatever gets you going,

191
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:12.660
how do you not vomit if you're a guy like women don't understand this.
I mean,

192
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.430
our son has just stepped on my balls and I'm like,
oh my God,

193
00:14:17.431 --> 00:14:22.380
and like double over and this guy has multiple punches,
kicks.

194
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.750
I'm saying,
forget if you like it.
How does your body not just shut down?

195
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:31.550
I don't understand.
Hey,
maybe we should ask if you could,

196
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.790
if you like getting your balls kicked and anybody out there like that.
I'm sure.

197
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:40.200
Yeah.
How do you deal with the pain?
How do,
how does your body not shut down?

198
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:45.510
And I'm also amazed at the size of those man's balls at the end.
They're huge.

199
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.240
I've never seen balls in real life,

200
00:14:48.241 --> 00:14:51.980
but I mean one hates you once with one of those.

201
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:57.010
<v 3>I'm telling you 99% of the population really is shut down</v>

202
00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:01.040
in voluntarily.
Shut down.
You're not going.

203
00:15:01.041 --> 00:15:03.830
I think I should not you physically,

204
00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:08.120
you can feel it up inside like your kidneys,
your you're,

205
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.120
you're lowered his house.
It feels like when you get kicked in the balls,

206
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:15.470
it's usually a delay.
It's like you get hit,
not what you respond to.

207
00:15:15.471 --> 00:15:20.000
It's a moment later and you,
I mean you feel nauseated.
You know what I mean?

208
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:23.780
You get hit hard enough.
Yeah.
You want to vomit your,
your eyes roll.
It's a pain.

209
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:27.580
That's the key.
It's just aches everywhere.
It's,
it's,
it's horrible.

210
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.610
<v 4>It's scared me.
Yeah.</v>

211
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.210
That's what it feels right now.

212
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:38.430
<v 3>The pain of it.
It's the worst.
It's the worst.
I can't tell you how bad it is,</v>

213
00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:44.380
but here's my thinking is that maybe they're not as affected by the pain.

214
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.120
I think they have to be there.

215
00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.990
There has to be something different about somebody that signs up for that.

216
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:53.130
Maybe that's like they don't have that much of a reaction to what you can't.

217
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.110
I mean I'm telling you,

218
00:15:56.460 --> 00:16:00.560
forget getting hit a grace for a lot of good.
For me.
I'm the,

219
00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:01.890
I'm that guy where like if,

220
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:06.450
if it was like someone had a backpack and swung it around and it just graze my

221
00:16:06.451 --> 00:16:10.230
balls,
I have to sit down and kind of gather,

222
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:14.010
gather myself before,
you know,
I wouldn't just walk away.

223
00:16:14.011 --> 00:16:15.980
I've got hold on a second would take,

224
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:19.350
it would take like a minute to respond and she's,

225
00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:24.120
she lines up her fist punches,
kicks him

226
00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:28.990
<v 4>knees,
knees,
full knees.
And then,
and then the two handers,
my favorite,</v>

227
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.120
cause it looks like she's pulling like a,

228
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:35.830
like a turnip out of the ground like that.
And it does look exactly like that.

229
00:16:35.831 --> 00:16:39.010
Right.
And then his balls are like grapefruits.

230
00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:43.750
I mean I'm never seen balls that big and I,
I keep watching cause I liked that.

231
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.200
The finale,
I don't really like saying guys get hurt.
That's not why I laugh.

232
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:48.063
I laugh at,

233
00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:52.330
I laugh at the size of that guy's nuts and how hard she's pulling.

234
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.030
And then you go,
who's into this?

235
00:16:55.031 --> 00:16:59.230
Like this is such a weird kink man calling on.
Yeah.

236
00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.760
Okay.
Would you rather it's pup play?
Okay.

237
00:17:03.761 --> 00:17:04.960
For your sexual outlet.

238
00:17:04.961 --> 00:17:09.730
You've only to the sexuality of pup play or getting your nuts kicked.

239
00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:14.680
Well,
does my pup play?
Is it only with guys or can I have a woman there?

240
00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.820
Because you're heterosexual.
I will make an allotment for a woman to be there.

241
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.260
Both cases.
Now you'll get to have,
excuse me,
sex in both scenarios,

242
00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:28.380
but before you do the foreplay is either pup play or aggressive ball kicking?

243
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.640
Yes.
Oh,
it's

244
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.260
<v 3>100% I'm a fucking dog.
I'd eat out of a dog bowl and take me on walks.</v>

245
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:36.380
I'll piss in the backyard.
You grow a tail,

246
00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.580
you can put eight dildos in my ass before I sign up for ball kicking

247
00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:47.300
potato patato you know,
I mean,
I would be first of all,
after one of those kicks,

248
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.040
100% it's nine one

249
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.880
<v 4>ambulance there.
Immediate,
the amber lamps,
amber lamps lamp.</v>

250
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:59.790
Yeah,
for sure.
Yeah.
One of them.
You can't really survive.
I feel like,
I mean,

251
00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:03.360
look,
nature nature's protecting those nuts that nature's telling you,
hey,

252
00:18:03.361 --> 00:18:06.570
don't fuck with what's in here.
What's in here is very important stuff.

253
00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:09.120
Precious cargo.
I mean,
first of all,

254
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:12.960
you shouldn't get hit like that in any part of your body,
right.
It's supposed to.

255
00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.820
It's not cool to sign up for a bleeding.

256
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:22.140
You know that part that's the most vulnerable part of the man's body.
Easily.

257
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:25.050
Yeah.
Why don't you ask someone to stab you in the eyes,
you know?

258
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:28.710
See if that does that feel good to fucking idiot.

259
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:31.700
God so stirred all,

260
00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.410
yeah,
all of it.
All that stuff makes me laugh.
Like all the violence,

261
00:18:37.411 --> 00:18:41.180
sexual fetishes like clamping nipples and like,
yeah.

262
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:42.863
It's so funny.

263
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:47.160
It's funny and we talked about this last night after Bobby and Karen mates we

264
00:18:47.161 --> 00:18:49.890
love is the like,
who's got the fucking time?

265
00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.530
How do you have time to develop these fetishes?

266
00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:56.940
Find out that's what you look like.
I mean,
most people don't have that kind of,

267
00:18:56.941 --> 00:18:59.970
I don't got that kind of time having a baby and stuff like,
Hey,
guess what?

268
00:18:59.971 --> 00:19:03.070
I like to have my nuts kicked butt this certain way and I like to have her pull

269
00:19:03.071 --> 00:19:08.040
them at the very end.
Like the job man.
Hey,
how do you know you like that fucking,

270
00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.680
yeah,
you got to go deep on that stuff.

271
00:19:10.681 --> 00:19:13.500
Like that's not a random discovery.
No,

272
00:19:13.501 --> 00:19:18.501
and especially because society will make you repress those desires a lot.

273
00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.380
Those,
those are great.
Those are,

274
00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:26.700
those are deeply repressed sexual fantasies by the way.

275
00:19:26.701 --> 00:19:28.960
So you really got to go deep.
You've got to take time away.

276
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.510
We really should be celebrating it.
But of course this does not being,
you know,

277
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.470
ashamed but,
but the time investment,
it's like going to therapy.

278
00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:40.560
You've got to go down,
down into the layers and figure out.

279
00:19:40.561 --> 00:19:42.480
But you know what I need is a slow thing.

280
00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:45.450
Like maybe it is a thing where the guy goes,
no,
what about this?

281
00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:50.220
Like what if he realizes he likes to be dominated so he signs up for that,

282
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.490
right?
And then okay,
that goes well no.

283
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.350
And there's like a little bit of spanking,
right?
Or like whipping or something.

284
00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.680
Clinton nipple clamping and he's like,
oh,
it's painful.
I like it.

285
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.740
And that slowly gets to like a little ball smack or something.

286
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.520
Like she's hitting him and then inadvertently grazes is nuts.
And was like,

287
00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.430
oh that hurts.
But I like that next time.

288
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:14.480
Why don't you go ahead and step that up a little bit.
But again,
at the time

289
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:21.560
I've seen a video of a high heels like this to let appeals where that stomps on

290
00:20:23.191 --> 00:20:27.350
dicks and balls.
It makes me laugh every time.
No,
no,
no.
But that like it hurts.

291
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.270
He'll like that hoof.
Yeah.
That's really,
that's,

292
00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:35.310
that's really something man.
Yeah,
it's intense.

293
00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:38.550
I don't know if I could,
I,
you know,
it's funny cause you and I,

294
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:43.230
once we put a baby jeans down for the night,
you've got to maybe,

295
00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:47.230
maybe a two hour window before you have to go to bed again and wake up at six in

296
00:20:47.231 --> 00:20:51.370
the morning with the kids.
So it's like,
ah,
Shit.
In my world,

297
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.530
in our world,
it's like we just got to,
you know,

298
00:20:53.531 --> 00:20:56.730
Bobby and carrying gotta go quick and then go to bed.
Yeah.

299
00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:59.020
And there's no time for fantasy,
you know,

300
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.870
ball play in pup play and all that crap,
man.
I mean,

301
00:21:01.871 --> 00:21:03.170
you gotta put your depth for your time.

302
00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:07.220
<v 8>Glen,
what's your ass?
Smells like coconut bowls.
Right.</v>

303
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.600
<v 4>This is single people.
Shit.
That's a time commitment.
Yeah.
This is single dudes.</v>

304
00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:15.050
And also to learn what they smell like.
Got,
damn.
You really is talking about,

305
00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:19.580
you know,
Rhett repetition.
Yeah.
It's a practice.
It's a technique.
You got to,

306
00:21:19.581 --> 00:21:22.310
you got to really dedicate yourself to pup play.
Oh yeah.

307
00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:26.320
You can't just be like a casual pop player.
No,
no,
no,
no.
That's,

308
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:27.470
it's really a commitment,
you know,

309
00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:32.060
<v 8>run your finger along the crack of your ass.
You don't need to finger your whole,</v>

310
00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:33.830
you don't want to come back with shit on your finger.

311
00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:37.140
<v 4>That's a good point.
Yeah.
The fact that he has to tell,</v>

312
00:21:37.141 --> 00:21:40.950
I don't think he has to tell people that.
Do you think he really needed to?
Uh,

313
00:21:40.951 --> 00:21:45.420
yes.
I think he did need to.
I think,
I think some of those pups were like,

314
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:49.070
oh,
finger it,
and he had to,
he,
he,
he learns that like,
yeah,

315
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:53.760
you got to tell them over time and he's alone.
Don't,
don't go inside.
Gosh.

316
00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.970
Yeah.
Because sometimes I feel like you don't need to be that specific with

317
00:21:56.971 --> 00:22:01.530
directions,
but apparently you do.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
Yeah.
You gotta be,

318
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:02.550
you gotta be specific.

319
00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:09.240
Do you want to see this lady flip out on a plane?
Oh yeah.
I like her.
I kind of,

320
00:22:09.241 --> 00:22:12.870
here's the thing,
she's definitely overreacting,

321
00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:17.820
but I do understand,
I do understand when it's like no one,
like a traveler,

322
00:22:17.821 --> 00:22:20.180
a business traveler.
Some of you out there are busy travel.

323
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:24.900
There's no that feeling of like,
will you just get off the fucking plane?

324
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.480
Sometimes you're in the back and you're like,
wait,

325
00:22:27.481 --> 00:22:29.880
are they loading in the next group of passengers?

326
00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.420
Because I feel like we've been standing back here for 30 fucking minutes.
Yeah.

327
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:34.800
It is the most unnerving.

328
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:38.580
And then you get mad at those fucking dilettantes Sunday travelers.
Yeah,

329
00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:43.110
I know who come with five loose bags.
Nothing is really tied together.

330
00:22:43.111 --> 00:22:45.390
And then one thing is up here.
Another thing is,

331
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:50.220
and this asshole's taking hits their time.
You like to get your life bro.

332
00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:50.760
And there's a,

333
00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:55.760
my favorite is sometimes the person will put their bag in the overhead behind

334
00:22:57.301 --> 00:23:00.300
where they sat.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Dummy.
Wait.

335
00:23:00.301 --> 00:23:04.050
They'll go back and get it when you land and then they'll be like,
I'm up there.

336
00:23:04.051 --> 00:23:07.560
They're like,
no.
Now you're back here.
Yeah.
You came back to get the bag.

337
00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.900
She didn't get to go back to the,
what are you talking about?

338
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:15.270
W what you do is you put the bag before you sit down cause there's still more

339
00:23:15.451 --> 00:23:19.620
overhead usually in the front.
Yeah,
but not first load.
Not at first.

340
00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.000
I see people do that.
[inaudible] a real scopes.

341
00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:23.820
They load the plane from back to front.

342
00:23:23.821 --> 00:23:27.900
Most airlines with the exception of like southwest or whatever chaos that

343
00:23:27.901 --> 00:23:29.370
fucking airline is.
Yeah.

344
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:33.780
So I always put mine in the row before,
right.

345
00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:36.770
My coach Rowe or whatever the fuck I'm sitting if I'm on in first class.

346
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.740
So that way when you're on the way out,
you pick up your bag,
dip shit.

347
00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:42.450
Don't put it back in the limit.

348
00:23:42.451 --> 00:23:46.280
Limit Gray you and let me upgrade you to the hottest channels.

349
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:49.460
<v 3>That was beyond saying,
I know she did direct TV commercial.</v>

350
00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:53.210
You believe that shit,
dude,
that's like Madonna upgrade you,
and she was like,

351
00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:56.150
I'm going to upgrade you to the hottest channels on directv.

352
00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:00.570
We couldn't believe that that was in 2000 like eight days old this year.

353
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:05.510
We got married,
we had our one luxury was cable TV and we would laugh at that.

354
00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:13.493
<v 2>I love it.</v>

355
00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:19.830
<v 3>Yeah.
That's kind of starting.
It's almost like she's talking to herself.
Sure.</v>

356
00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:23.850
She has her headphones on.
I think she might be listening to music.

357
00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.990
I feel what this guy looks like here in a moment is how I feel all the time.

358
00:24:27.991 --> 00:24:29.790
Whenever I see crazy.

359
00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:34.840
<v 2>Yeah.
Like that
to that guy.</v>

360
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.590
<v 3>See how he's,
he's covering his face.</v>

361
00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:50.990
It's like when you're cringing for someone.

362
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:55.540
That's how I feel most of the time in life when somebody speaks a more like

363
00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:57.520
that's such a,
you know,
you do that face a lot.
Yeah.

364
00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:02.060
You've done that with me if a lot with you.
What do you mean?

365
00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.570
Just like,
oh,
yesterday we were at Neiman Marcus.

366
00:25:05.571 --> 00:25:09.020
We were in there buying socks for Yale and I was like,

367
00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:12.680
there's these stupid plastic shorts.
What,

368
00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:17.690
you got to set that up differently though?
Because you were doing a bit,

369
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:21.750
you were doing a bit and maybe a laugh.
I'm talking about when someone's serious,

370
00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.850
that's when I'm embarrassed to you is what I'm usually trying to make you laugh.

371
00:25:25.851 --> 00:25:30.620
I'm public.
And then you go,
oh my God.
Yeah,
that was,
yeah.
So here's what happened.

372
00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.080
Um,
we,

373
00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:37.240
we have a lunch coming up and we're going to dress nice.

374
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:44.480
So I had to,
I was like,
oh,
I'll,
I'll,
I'll dress nice then,

375
00:25:44.481 --> 00:25:48.230
but I don't think I have any,
I don't know where they are.
Dressed socks,
you know.

376
00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:52.670
So I was like,
let's stop.
And the,
we're at the country club,
the up in the,
uh,

377
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.580
one of the department stores and buy a dress socks.

378
00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.230
Neiman forecast is,
is like,
I mean,

379
00:26:00.231 --> 00:26:05.231
it is outrageous as far as that is like a couture store and other words like,

380
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:08.450
hi,
and who buys that stuff?
Super,

381
00:26:08.451 --> 00:26:11.240
super expensive designer designers should like,

382
00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.590
it's her dad's only a few that are in that company.
I feel like,
you know,

383
00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:20.330
most people know that you go to Macy's and then you step up to Bloomingdale's or

384
00:26:20.331 --> 00:26:23.150
whatever and,
and then you know,
it goes,
it goes on up.

385
00:26:23.151 --> 00:26:26.780
But like Neiman Marcus is like,
it's like shirts,

386
00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:31.580
shirts and stuff.
Yeah,
it's really crazy.
So anyways,

387
00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:36.830
that's about,
I'm comfortable,
right?
Some of the stuff there,

388
00:26:36.831 --> 00:26:41.270
but then they always have the range.
I know there's a one that I went into,

389
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:45.030
I was in Beverly Hills one time after a meeting and I needed,

390
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:46.950
I forget what a belt or something.

391
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:52.260
And so I went into the ones that are on Wilshire there a Barney's,

392
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:57.330
oh fuck.
A Barney's.
Barney's has like $5,000 sweatshirts and you're like,

393
00:26:57.331 --> 00:27:00.610
oh,
buy this.
Who would wear a $5,000 sweatshirt?
You know?

394
00:27:00.611 --> 00:27:05.160
Even if we had millions of dollars,
if we had bill gates money,

395
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:09.660
there's nothing on earth that justifies,
in my opinion,
a $5,000 shirt.
No,

396
00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:11.070
of course not unethical.

397
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:14.490
It's fucking bananas to even spend that much on a tee shirt.

398
00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.080
Crazy.
I know that would have to be your worries.

399
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:22.860
Like you'd have to work in fashion to be justify something like this.

400
00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:25.380
A fucking nothing.
Anyways,
there's a whole,

401
00:27:25.381 --> 00:27:28.950
the have like normal high end clothes and then there's a whole section of just

402
00:27:28.951 --> 00:27:32.010
designer nonsense where you're like,
who the fuck would wear this?

403
00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:37.140
And I was buying,
I was paying for my socks or hair of blacks,
which by the way,

404
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.350
they're dressed socks were at least the ones I bought were normally priced.

405
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:44.040
Oh they were like $16,
which I is socks.
I know,

406
00:27:44.041 --> 00:27:48.720
but I'm saying for that store I was always expecting it to be something crazy to

407
00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:53.560
anyways you go.
And we were making fun of um,

408
00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:56.910
some of the clothes like on the phone and the guy noticed by the way,

409
00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:01.200
cause we take pictures of each other holding up their clothes.
Um,

410
00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:05.340
well good cause he,
he knows it's ridiculous.
Yeah.
I put it on Instagram.

411
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:10.170
A picture of me in a picture of you.
Yeah.
And Yeah,
he noticed.
But anyways,

412
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.420
so we're by,
he goes,
I saw you looking at,

413
00:28:12.421 --> 00:28:14.970
and it was actually called something jeans.
It was like Ruby's jeans.

414
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.190
And I was like,
yeah,
he goes,

415
00:28:17.191 --> 00:28:20.250
you didn't strike me as the type of guy that would wear that.
And I was like,

416
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:24.990
oh yeah I wasn't.
And then he's checking me out and you go,

417
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:29.520
Hey Tom,
how about these?
And you held up like black,

418
00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:33.060
what?
What was the material?
I go,
Gosh,

419
00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.360
do you guys have like plastic shorts?

420
00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.240
Do you guys have any plastic?

421
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.060
Because they look like they're made of like garbage bags,

422
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:49.020
but I want to pay like $400 for them.
And the guy,
I forget even what he says,

423
00:28:49.021 --> 00:28:53.840
but that's when you started your hand went,
I was like,
God mom,

424
00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.890
cause you also go,
you go seems breathable.
Especially in the summer.

425
00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:04.020
Like you're saying like all this kind of passive aggressive insulting stuff.

426
00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:08.700
And I'm like,
um,
the lady picked up on it too.
She goes,

427
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.080
she goes,
they're actually really comfortable.
We're like,
okay sure.

428
00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:17.210
Uh,
who's buying the plastic shorts in the summertime?

429
00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:22.260
These crazy person answered it is absurd and it's expensive and yeah,

430
00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:26.790
whatever.
Anyways,
they um,
you know,

431
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:30.330
they have a laugh and I,
and then the guy kind of is like,
you know,
I go,

432
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:33.420
who does buy this as well?
He goes,
actually the guy,

433
00:29:33.421 --> 00:29:37.090
the designer of that was here and he doesn't wear that shit guy.

434
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:42.040
The designer of this ridiculous clothes doesn't wear his clothes.
Right.
He

435
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.970
<v 4>goes,
the designer is French by the way.
It's,
yeah,
it totally,
by the way,</v>

436
00:29:45.971 --> 00:29:48.730
all those clothes look like foreign cousin clothing.

437
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:53.710
Like my Hungarian relatives will be like,
this is great.
What nice glows.

438
00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:58.590
There's like studs on it and red paint.
They would wear that.

439
00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:04.620
It's all denim and like different colors the way you normally dressed to hungry

440
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:07.990
where they'd be like,
what are you wearing?
Yeah,
they think I'm a total peg.

441
00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.130
They're always like,
oh genes,

442
00:30:10.131 --> 00:30:14.470
all of his adding genes and they like to wear white pants a lot in the summer

443
00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:18.150
and white shoes and I don't fucking rock.
I,
I never rocked the answer.

444
00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.700
We took them to saddle ranch and they thought that was the best thing.

445
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.620
You see the cars drive by and they had,
they're tight.

446
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:31.500
They have those type white sneakers on that looked like their foot binding
shows.

447
00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:35.560
European stocks did.
My year old.
They love.
Yeah,

448
00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:39.290
they love autumn on the suit.
This is odd.
One is the best.

449
00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:43.480
This is the best our money on Monday.
They love that shit.
Did,

450
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:48.370
I mean,
yeah,
it's flashy.
Flashy.
It's too flashy for Americans.

451
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:52.840
I bet you like a lot of tourists go in there and they buy that shit.
Like euro,

452
00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.750
like my,
my lane,
like Ukrainian.

453
00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:59.500
Basically in most circles in this country.

454
00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:03.490
You would get your ass kicked for wearing that easily.
Yeah.
Dude,

455
00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:07.330
you can't walk up in this place.
I mean you can't walk in and be like,
what?

456
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.100
Like I got these torrents studied,
spray painted Jean shorts on.

457
00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:15.680
What's up and people would pick the fuck is wrong with you.
Yeah,

458
00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:18.340
because we pulled the pair of Jorts yeah.

459
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.510
That were like painted on and studs and

460
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:27.430
studied jorts.
First of all,
if you're wearing shorts,

461
00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:30.970
you're somewhere in the south.
Likely.
You know what I mean?

462
00:31:30.971 --> 00:31:34.840
Like you're sitting on a trailer or something.
I think you don't,

463
00:31:34.841 --> 00:31:39.280
you have a joke about dirt driveways and was like,
yeah,
you're on a,

464
00:31:39.281 --> 00:31:42.760
you're on a dirt driveway.
Yes.
It's not a good look,

465
00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:46.060
but don't dress up a George.
No,
the does casual.

466
00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:50.200
The Jordan is by nature dressed down $800 easily,
dude,

467
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:53.800
high end fashion is enraging world.

468
00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:59.260
When were like you are paying what?
Yeah.
Well cause I often just,

469
00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:02.170
I like to look at that stuff and like Stella Mccartney,

470
00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:06.640
she always has stuff and Neiman Marcus and I sometimes I like her stuff but I'm

471
00:32:06.641 --> 00:32:08.290
like,
dude,
I can't pay,

472
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:13.210
I won't pay rather $1,500 for a pair of fucking sneakers with a dazzling on
them.

473
00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.410
Man Who's doing this?
Who's supporting this nonsense.

474
00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:22.330
I also think about that like how many people have to buy that to make that work?

475
00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:23.890
Five.
No,

476
00:32:23.891 --> 00:32:27.700
I'm saying more than make that line work,

477
00:32:27.701 --> 00:32:29.500
so all those people are wearing this fucking thing.

478
00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:32.410
I think in the case of like a Stella Mccartney,

479
00:32:32.411 --> 00:32:34.120
she doesn't have to work for money.

480
00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:38.960
It's one of those things where this is like my pet project.
The,

481
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:40.040
no daddy set

482
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.780
<v 3>up the estate for me.
But a title,</v>

483
00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:46.070
don't you need a busy bunch of things that are like 100 bucks so that like a lot

484
00:32:46.071 --> 00:32:46.750
of people can buy.

485
00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:51.310
<v 4>Right?
Like isn't there a line,
a lower tiered that regular people buy?</v>

486
00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.270
I'm assuming?

487
00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:57.700
<v 3>Yeah.
I don't know.
But when shoes are $1,000 I'm like,
oh my gosh,</v>

488
00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:02.260
we're sneakers.
That makes me particularly furious.
Yeah.
And like,

489
00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:05.760
and I know a lot of sneaker heads and it's cool.
Like I love,

490
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:07.750
I have nothing but sneakers basically.
Yeah.

491
00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:12.490
But I have like a major cap on that too.
Well what's your,
what's,
yeah,

492
00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:17.170
I think $1,000 for Gucci sneakers is a crazy ridiculous,

493
00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.860
I thought you were about to say is,
is that your cap?
I'm like way below,

494
00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.120
way below that.

495
00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:26.380
<v 4>Uh,
cause we'd been in Gucci at the country club and I've been like,</v>

496
00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.650
who the fuck is buying this?
And it is,
it's all foreigners.
It's all like,

497
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:34.650
you know,
Asian,
whatever people are Saudi,
the Saudi princess.
It's here.

498
00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.460
<v 3>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Visiting for the,
her summer room,
Springer,</v>

499
00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:41.140
whatever before she gets married or has a lot of money actually that that pours

500
00:33:41.141 --> 00:33:45.010
in from,
from tourist stores.
Absolutely.
Like in Beverly Hills.

501
00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:50.160
I mean it's not really,
it's not the locals who are shopping on Rodeo tourists.

502
00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:51.320
Right.
There was that I went to,

503
00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:55.480
we went to that restaurant and it's in a hotel there and that's what the guy

504
00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.070
told me.
He goes,
oh,

505
00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:02.820
he said it's so hot in the Middle East during the summer that they come here

506
00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:07.180
where it's by the way hot,
he goes,

507
00:34:07.181 --> 00:34:11.380
this is so much less hot that they'll come here.

508
00:34:11.890 --> 00:34:14.930
They'll uh,
they'll stay in one of our,

509
00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:19.780
like they'll run out of florists suites.
Wow.
For us for a couple months.

510
00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:23.890
Shop,
shop,
shop,
shop,
shop,
fly back.
They love to shop.
Yeah.

511
00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:27.570
And I heard it and I'm like,
we're talking about dozens and dozens of,

512
00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:29.450
of groups of people doing this.

513
00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:33.840
<v 4>They all come together as a family and,
well I heard a story,
it's like the,</v>

514
00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:37.100
those Middle Eastern girls who are about 20 years old,

515
00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.030
it's like their last hurrah before they get married.
Off or whatever.

516
00:34:41.031 --> 00:34:42.960
They'll come to like Beverly hills.
Yeah,

517
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:46.700
and they'll come with their friends and their quote chaperones and they'll go to

518
00:34:46.701 --> 00:34:47.181
Gucci,

519
00:34:47.181 --> 00:34:50.690
Prada and they'll buy all the stuff that they can't wear back home and they'll

520
00:34:50.691 --> 00:34:53.240
wear it out in the streets and we'll go night clubbing or whatever.

521
00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:57.110
One time where?
Yup.
And then leave it behind.
Just thousands and thousands of,

522
00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.960
they won't,
you can't take it back because they'll go,
you know,

523
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:02.450
mom and daddy or I'll see it or whatever.
Their customs,

524
00:35:02.451 --> 00:35:05.330
I don't fucking know what the deal is,
but they don't take the clothing back.

525
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.040
That's,
that's where it all here.

526
00:35:07.041 --> 00:35:09.290
And then put the fucking Burke on once they get back home.

527
00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:14.340
<v 3>Yeah,
I know the Chinese too.
They're like spending crazy money.
Yeah.
Great.</v>

528
00:35:14.341 --> 00:35:18.150
Let them shit.
Yeah.
Anyway,
I am buying,
you're fucking crazy.

529
00:35:18.151 --> 00:35:22.710
Jorts for $800 someone has to
for Jorts.

530
00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:27.380
They should give you those George.
They should be like,
will you take these?
Yeah.

531
00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:31.140
You make your own.
George gave me $100.
I would take them,

532
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:34.200
but I wouldn't wear them.
I'd take him out for them.
You'd take him out?

533
00:35:34.201 --> 00:35:36.630
Would you wear their lifespan?
Will you take these with you?
I'll be like,

534
00:35:36.631 --> 00:35:37.980
I'll take,
I'm not

535
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.480
<v 4>going to wear them.
What if that company hears this?
And they're like,
Tom,</v>

536
00:35:42.481 --> 00:35:46.860
I know you've got a Netflix buyers will coming up.
We're going to offer you here.

537
00:35:46.861 --> 00:35:51.240
We out.
Huh?
$1 million to where the jorts and the cool shirt.

538
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:56.010
The gold.
No,
I won't do $1 million.
I would do it for the cover art.

539
00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:00.750
That's my negotiating tool.
I'll do the cover art and your stupid outfit,

540
00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:05.460
but I will not shoot my specs on it because of an outfit like that will change

541
00:36:05.461 --> 00:36:09.510
your whole persona.
The people could watch what I'm talking.
No one would be like,

542
00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:11.400
I,
they'd be like,
I,
I heard you were talking,

543
00:36:11.401 --> 00:36:14.940
but I didn't listen because I watched your jorts.
It's like Eddie is,

544
00:36:14.941 --> 00:36:17.100
are doing standup and heals.
People were like,
wait,

545
00:36:17.101 --> 00:36:21.810
this guy's wearing fucking heels.
Like,
so distracting.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,

546
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.670
well that's too bad.
You know,
maybe,

547
00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:27.270
maybe we'll get a nice really expensive clothing line to sponsor your next

548
00:36:27.271 --> 00:36:31.980
special.

557
00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:04.163
I am like,

558
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:08.250
<v 3>I like,
um,
if I had a job for it,
I would,
you know,</v>

559
00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:10.400
I would wear nice ties.
Yeah.

560
00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:15.360
But I don't have a job but smell better than I used to.

561
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:17.400
All right,
let's go back to this lady losing her mind.

562
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:22.970
<v 2>I'm in pain so I don't care who you are.
It sounds to me like,
you know,
me</v>

563
00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.860
<v 4>dry the real,
that's one of those lines.</v>

564
00:37:29.861 --> 00:37:34.130
You can always pull on someone as a,
don't talk to me like,
you know me,
they,

565
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:37.660
that's a big line.
I'm on the Internet.
You don't know me.

566
00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.760
You don't talk like you know him,
you know shit about me.

567
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:43.550
<v 3>Yo,
one time,
one of the scary scary at my scariest la,</v>

568
00:37:43.551 --> 00:37:47.780
one of them La incident was,
um,
years ago,

569
00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:51.470
this is when I was working,
uh,
I forget one of the most,

570
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:54.100
one of my morning,
you know,
uh,

571
00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:58.040
postproduction jobs and I was at a gas station and silver lake,

572
00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:03.740
it's like eight 30 in the morning rush hour traffic.
Everyone's in,

573
00:38:03.741 --> 00:38:06.410
you know,
cars are flying by.
Anyways,

574
00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:10.430
I'm filling up my tank and a car that's,
that had just,

575
00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:15.170
I guess gotten gas rips through the parking lot,
like goes like she hates.

576
00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:19.850
So all I did was I was,
I was putting gas in and I looked up and I went,
like,

577
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:23.930
I shook my head and then I go back to,
you know,

578
00:38:23.931 --> 00:38:26.310
looking at the tank and then I hear it

579
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:29.660
<v 4>and I look up</v>

580
00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.480
<v 3>and the guy had reversed,</v>

581
00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:37.240
stopped right in front of me and he goes,
what's up dog?

582
00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.270
And I go,
and it's a,
it's a goofy,

583
00:38:40.271 --> 00:38:45.271
I kind of a goofy looking white guy with black hair and a like a bad thin black

584
00:38:47.681 --> 00:38:51.640
mustache.
Like almost like it doesn't grow in hmm.
You know,
not almost,
it doesn't,

585
00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:56.190
it doesn't grow in completely.
And it's kind of a,
uh,

586
00:38:56.260 --> 00:39:00.820
tweaked out look in his eyes,
you know,
he goes,
what's up dog?
And I go,

587
00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.310
what's up?
And he goes,
you acting like you know me homie.

588
00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:09.550
And this is because I had gone like this,
like an eye roll.

589
00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:12.550
Yeah.
I like rolled my eyes at him ripping through this parking lot.

590
00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:16.750
And in that moment I remember with flashed through my head was like,

591
00:39:16.751 --> 00:39:20.980
this guy doesn't seem like a capable,

592
00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:25.660
tough guy or anything like that.
But in my head,
like this is like all happening,

593
00:39:25.661 --> 00:39:27.790
obviously a million miles a second.

594
00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:32.820
I go for him to say this right now to me means that this dude doesn't have a lot

595
00:39:37.511 --> 00:39:42.400
to lose.
Like he's,
and also I think maybe,

596
00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:46.180
you know what if he has a gun on him?
That was my thought.
And he's looking for,

597
00:39:46.181 --> 00:39:48.460
he's looking at,
he's looking for an exchange,
right?
Yeah.

598
00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:51.790
So I just absolutely just went,

599
00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:56.260
I just shook my head like [inaudible] and then I turned back to the like of the

600
00:39:56.261 --> 00:39:57.300
gas.
Yeah.
I think.

601
00:39:57.430 --> 00:40:01.660
And then I just like a second pass and then I heard him and he'd ripped out of

602
00:40:01.661 --> 00:40:05.230
their good.
At least he left you alone.
Oh,
I mean,
I was trying to diffuse,

603
00:40:05.231 --> 00:40:09.490
but it wasn't like it's a dude was like,
where you go like,
Oh shit,

604
00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:13.510
this guy,
this guy is going gonna fuck me up.
Yeah.
I looked at this guy like,

605
00:40:13.511 --> 00:40:18.340
this dude has to be mentally ill.

606
00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:20.380
Yeah.
Or,
or

607
00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:23.490
<v 4>sitting on a handgun right now in that car waiting,</v>

608
00:40:23.491 --> 00:40:27.900
just itching is waiting for me to say like,
what's up bitch?
Going to losers do.

609
00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:31.830
Yeah.
I learned that lesson in public school too.
Don't,
don't look,

610
00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:34.350
just don't look whatever shit is going down.

611
00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:36.890
That's like the New York subway lesson.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're like,

612
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.920
don't look out to do.
That's what I did.
Eyes down did.
I was down.

613
00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.630
Don't even fight,
but I'll never forget those two.
Cause like I said,

614
00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:47.400
the exact exchange was what's up dog.
And it's a brilliant,
he goes,

615
00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:51.990
you acting like you know me,
homie.
I was like,
no sir.

616
00:40:51.991 --> 00:40:55.950
I do not know you.
No Sir.
No.
That's so funny.

617
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:59.040
I kicked out.
Yeah,
he's probably cranked out.
Oh,

618
00:40:59.041 --> 00:41:02.820
you know what's great is that we're teaching our son about creepers.
Yeah.
Hey,

619
00:41:02.821 --> 00:41:05.100
that's a creeper.
Yeah.
Tell 'em that's what you've been telling us.

620
00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:06.990
That guy's creepy.
Don't even look at that guy.

621
00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:11.550
But you gotta teach your kids eyes down.
Don't even,
don't look at crazy.

622
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:15.870
I'll talk about it.
Don't address it.
No,
no vigilante,
you know,

623
00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:18.420
don't taxi driver anything.
Just fucking eyes down,
dude.

624
00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:24.140
You've got these crazy eyebrows are cat.
He's always like,

625
00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:29.190

Yeah,

I'm from the Colorado.</v>

626
00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:34.550
Colorado's don't give a fuck

Let's go.

627
00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:36.730
We got to though.
I love it.

628
00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:39.760
<v 4>Let's see.
This guy's hand going like this.
You see that?
Yeah.</v>

629
00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:44.240
This guy here and he's like,
he's mocking her as she does this.

630
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:46.820
<v 2>Wow.
Let's go</v>

631
00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:54.930

I agree with her.
This is exactly how I feel.</v>

632
00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:58.250
Too crazy every time I'm on a plane so I,
if this bitch is on my plan,

633
00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:02.580
I'd be like,

Thank you.
You know that it's,

634
00:42:02.581 --> 00:42:06.480
and she's going too far with it,
but she does.
Oddly enough.

635
00:42:06.481 --> 00:42:09.630
How a point she's got the right idea,
dude.

636
00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:12.790
<v 2>Good girl waving down my leg.</v>

637
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:17.350
I have blood going down my legs off the plane.

638
00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:23.260
I'm sorry.
I'm being nice.

639
00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:27.850
<v 4>Yeah,

640
00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:31.390

She broke this guy.
He's like,

641
00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.010

642
00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:37.080
<v 2>I do.

Do</v>

643
00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:42.030

644
00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:45.170
Matt knows I need to get to the

645
00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:52.320

646
00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:55.070
<v 4>What are you guys?
Move aside,

647
00:42:55.071 --> 00:42:57.830
You know what I would do if I were that guy in front of her?
I be like,

648
00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:01.780
Oh hey guys,

Can everybody move aside and let her,

649
00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:04.550
she's in pain.
Like why has nobody letting her off?

650
00:43:04.551 --> 00:43:08.210
If she's that itchy to go like,
seriously,
she's in pain.

651
00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:11.480
I just wouldn't want to hear it anymore.
Right.
That too.
I mean there's that too.

652
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:16.140
I would love for you to stop talking.
So let her go,

Definitely go hard.

653
00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.360

You want to talk some shit?
Yeah.

There are children.
You have to stop living your lives.

674
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.790
My child is here.

675
00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:38.850
That's right.

679
00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:05.480
She was like,

Our children.

He's so embarrassed.
He's like,

683
00:45:18.631 --> 00:45:22.430
please make this shit happen.
So it,
oh,
smiles

684
00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:28.320
ear to ear.
And you're just stoked.
Yeah.
Pupils are dilated.

685
00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:32.760
So exciting.
Yeah.
This is my one.

686
00:45:32.761 --> 00:45:36.480
I'm the one thing about New York City that I really like.

687
00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:38.430
I'd moved there just for the subway.

688
00:45:38.431 --> 00:45:42.510
Crazy because I feel like there's a lot more action in public in New York City

689
00:45:42.511 --> 00:45:46.470
than in La.
100% but you're also with people all the time.

690
00:45:46.471 --> 00:45:50.370
That's why you're,
you're,
you're in your car.
Yeah.
We don't get a lot of that.

691
00:45:50.590 --> 00:45:54.190
No Fun crates.
Public crazy action.
No sucks.

692
00:45:54.191 --> 00:45:57.420
Public crazy is the norm in New York and in San Francisco.

693
00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:03.690
Downtown still has his bad it down out here though.

694
00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:08.430
Last time I was in downtown La,
a guy in an alley,

695
00:46:08.431 --> 00:46:12.630
but like taking a shit.
Is that together?

696
00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:16.230
We were looking at potential loft.
We were considering moving there.

697
00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:19.840
At one point he was standing,
standing and shitting.

698
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:23.400
I often think about how strong his thigh muscles must have been.

699
00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:26.850
That's what you think about.
Yes.
Cause that was a prolonged squat.

700
00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:32.370
He was half squatting.
He wasn't even like,
it's leaning in squatting.
It's hard.

701
00:46:32.371 --> 00:46:35.310
But I mean,
he was,
he was so used to it that he just,

702
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:37.080
he just needs were barely bent.

703
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:41.430
I can't believe we have the same memory synergy.

704
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:47.310
That was real neat.
I do think about it and I saw the poo falling down.

705
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:51.630
That's the craziest part is that like we saw a man shitting and an alleyway

706
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:54.720
together together.
Together.
It was really,

707
00:46:54.721 --> 00:46:59.721
really something in front of the children are his children here.

708
00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:05.690
There's children then the anybody.
Does anybody care that there's children here?

709
00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.300
We can't explain this to our child.
Um,

710
00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:14.610
I think one of the best clips ever to grace your mom's house is that that

711
00:47:14.611 --> 00:47:15.450
homeless guy,

712
00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:21.610
he shifts in public homeless guy getting raped by gay goes.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

713
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:24.360
I don't know if that's still even up there.
It's been so long.

714
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:29.390
But a special clip you a pad.

715
00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:33.130
An interesting thing.
How would you finish this?
Oh,
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

716
00:47:33.131 --> 00:47:35.080
I thought we were going with our oh,
okay.

717
00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.090
<v 9>All these other responsibilities</v>

718
00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:42.330
for your family on board.

719
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:46.370
Not Necessary to drop the F bomb.
Okay,
great.

720
00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:48.350
And we've already called integrity

721
00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:51.370
<v 3>security.</v>

722
00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:55.210
<v 4>No,
she didn't have a bad,
she's going to bleed out.
She's got a bad by a bad bite.</v>

723
00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:58.320
Yeah.
She better get her fucking Tampon and look for that.

724
00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:01.060
<v 9>I'm bleeding all over my vagina.
Yeah,</v>

725
00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:05.260
<v 3>yeah,
yeah.
Um,
yeah.
So you want to talk about dumps,</v>

726
00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:08.660
let's talk some shit.
You want to talk some shit and just talk it.

727
00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:11.860
<v 1>Oh,</v>

728
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:18.610
<v 9>next door.
Brown,
Todd Brown,
dark coming off.</v>

729
00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:23.340
<v 3>So for those of you that don't know,
um,</v>

730
00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:27.030
you know,
I,
I'm,
I'm a brown guy,
brown master.

731
00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:30.390
And for awhile I was like,
man,

732
00:48:30.391 --> 00:48:34.190
I mean I even had a standup bit about having diarrhea all the time.

733
00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:40.080
I got to the point where I said,
you know,
this is you.
You were like,
yeah,

734
00:48:40.081 --> 00:48:42.080
this is pretty bad,
but I hear it all.

735
00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:46.070
<v 4>You had a bad bite.
Well,
and also,
um,
in is a joke of yours,</v>

736
00:48:46.071 --> 00:48:48.780
but the origin is in truth.
Yeah.
Yeah.

737
00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:53.060
And that one time you had such a violent brown and this is in our home in silver

738
00:48:53.061 --> 00:48:57.020
lake that I could hear it from the living room and you came out and I said,

739
00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.940
do we have to go to the emergency room?
Yeah,

740
00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:02.960
because it was so violent and that,
by the way,

741
00:49:02.961 --> 00:49:04.910
I hear it echoing in my eye.

742
00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:08.220
<v 3>I still feel like I,
uh,
I feel like</v>

743
00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:13.120
<v 9>I still farm or shit like that all the time.
Yeah,
all the time.</v>

744
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:17.920
What do you mean you're still shitting like that?
No,
I'm saying I,
I,

745
00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:22.600
I never felt like that really ended after that for years and years.

746
00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:25.720
Years.
Yeah.
Well,
it started,
at least I acknowledged it.

747
00:49:25.721 --> 00:49:27.370
I don't know if it started in silver lake.

748
00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:30.120
How long have you been shedding like that?
I can't even,

749
00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:32.500
I can't even tell you this a long time.

750
00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:36.880
So it kept going and kept happening.

751
00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:40.660
And then on this show I told you the

752
00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:44.620
thank you a lot.
You seriously,
when he's in a bag,

753
00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:48.490
I was serious about the fact that

754
00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.870
I actually went to a gastroenterologist.

755
00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:01.860
I just haven't heard the Camden.
Yeah.

756
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.480
Gosh,
that's good.
Okay.

757
00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:06.620
<v 3>So I went and I,</v>

758
00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:11.230
I saw this guy and then we scheduled a colonoscopy and they were going to check

759
00:50:11.231 --> 00:50:16.150
out my poop Shit,
you know,
and I had it moved a bunch of times,
reschedule

760
00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:19.940
<v 4>risk.
We had,
we had moved houses
and</v>

761
00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:24.770
<v 3>touring and touring.
So altogether I kept rescheduling it anyways.</v>

762
00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:28.550
At the same time the rescheduling was going on,

763
00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:33.610
I was changing my diet and competing in this weight loss contest with Bart and

764
00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:37.290
then,
you know,

765
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:40.490
I kind of forgot about the last time I scheduled or changed it.

766
00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:45.650
So you know,
it ends and a or you know,

767
00:50:45.651 --> 00:50:50.630
the contest ends and then I'm kind of in this new way of eating,

768
00:50:50.631 --> 00:50:55.310
which is I basically live by an eat with a,
a Keto lifestyle,

769
00:50:55.311 --> 00:51:00.290
which is high fat,
moderate protein,
no sugar,
no carbs.

770
00:51:00.291 --> 00:51:04.070
I get my,
my net carbs come from vegetables.
Right?

771
00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:09.110
Anyways,
that's basically how I eat.
Well,
ever since I've been eating like that,

772
00:51:09.111 --> 00:51:10.550
I wasn't even really paying attention to it.

773
00:51:10.551 --> 00:51:15.551
My browns changed to and then I kinda realized that I wasn't having these crazy

774
00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:23.360
violent,
explosive shifts all the time.
And then this weekend,
you know,

775
00:51:23.361 --> 00:51:27.110
I'm mostly a good boy,
but I decided like,
oh,
you know,

776
00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:32.060
it's okay to have,
you know,
have fun every once in a while.
Right.
A little.
Yeah.

777
00:51:32.061 --> 00:51:36.200
So we're out and we go,
hey,
you know,
what do you feel like I go,

778
00:51:36.201 --> 00:51:40.310
I feel like having like a,
I want to,
I want to have like a sugary,

779
00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:45.050
I haven't indulged in sugar in a minute,
so I want to go have like a sugary meal.

780
00:51:45.051 --> 00:51:46.610
I want to have like a waffle or something.

781
00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:51.910
<v 4>So that's your go to binge?
Yeah.
I think my goto binge is wine.</v>

782
00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:55.060
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
You like wine,
cheese.
I like that a lot.
Yeah.

783
00:51:55.410 --> 00:51:59.130
<v 3>Well I haven't had,
you know,
like I said,
the French toast and forever,</v>

784
00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:03.470
so since the day you won the bed,
actually.
Yeah.
So I go,
you know,
it's,

785
00:52:03.471 --> 00:52:06.120
it's fine to do it today and then you get back on the horse,
you know,

786
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:09.270
and you just do it for a meal.
You don't do it all day.
Yeah.
So,

787
00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:13.440
and I also take the stuff that that helps me afterwards.
Uh,

788
00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:17.460
has like direct vomit.
No,
I have it has key tones in it and everything.

789
00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:20.180
I tell you to try that.
So anyways,
um,

790
00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:24.690
we go the French toast is delightful.
It's,
you know,

791
00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:29.490
it's great dude.
Within 10 minutes of eating it,

792
00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:35.480
I can feel the bubbles in my gut and I have to rush home and run inside and I

793
00:52:37.681 --> 00:52:40.560
have explosive,
crazy,

794
00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:44.520
<v 4>crazy doctor Ram
heritable.</v>

795
00:52:45.090 --> 00:52:48.760
And I mean it's,
and it reminded me that like,
oh,

796
00:52:48.761 --> 00:52:53.650
that was more of like a standard shift for me eight months ago.

797
00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:57.340
Right.
You would have [inaudible] constantly all the time.

798
00:52:57.341 --> 00:52:58.420
Here's when you would have them.

799
00:52:58.630 --> 00:53:03.630
I remember I would make a record mentally after snoozy because we would tend to

800
00:53:03.701 --> 00:53:07.630
order the fried items.
Maybe like a tempura something.

801
00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:12.280
Um,
sometimes rich.
Yeah.
Rich,

802
00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:17.470
rich can do it to anyone.
Like creams,
like parents.
We'll do it too.

803
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:22.140
<v 3>Do I mean something really rich,
something really greasy that can,</v>

804
00:53:22.141 --> 00:53:26.260
someone that can fuck with anyone's,
but yeah.
Yeah.
The cream sauces.

805
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:27.720
<v 4>Fuck my ass up pretty bad.</v>

806
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:32.750
But I thought that it was interesting that I haven't been indulging in sugar.

807
00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:38.660
I have a sugar indulgence and boom goes the dynamite.

808
00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:42.680
Right.
Bad.

809
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:51.420
Yeah.
I don't think that there's anything,

810
00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:00.950
I don't think there's anything funnier to me personally.
Um,

811
00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:05.520
as when I just over the years we've been together 12 years,

812
00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:07.980
something like that and nothing makes me laugh harder

813
00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:15.930
when we're driving home from any restaurant and the diarrhea hits you and you're

814
00:54:16.981 --> 00:54:18.030
driving and you're like,

815
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:24.420
it does matter because I know that you're driving at the top of the speed limit.

816
00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:26.400
And I can just,
I like,

817
00:54:26.401 --> 00:54:29.130
I know where you are emotionally because I've been there too.

818
00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:32.100
And I know it happens when the closer you get to the house.

819
00:54:32.101 --> 00:54:35.310
Like it's like your asshole knows when you're pulling in the driveway and then

820
00:54:35.311 --> 00:54:38.060
your butthole stumps to like spasm,
you know?

821
00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:41.670
And that's even worse when you get the key in the door.
Cause you're like,

822
00:54:41.671 --> 00:54:45.230
I'm going to shit my pants now.
It's like your butthole knows does.
No,

823
00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:48.390
I mean it's a miracle that you can make it to the toilet.
Sometimes.

824
00:54:48.690 --> 00:54:52.860
I had a belt on.
Remember I got to the bathroom on Saturday and I was like,
oh,

825
00:54:52.861 --> 00:54:55.800
the fucking belt.
It was really bad.

826
00:54:56.310 --> 00:55:00.720
But it makes me laugh so hard.
Every time I laugh.
Fucking so hard.

827
00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:05.940
Damn.
That's funny,
Dude.
12 hours later,
everything's back to normal.

828
00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:11.340
The next,
next few meals or normal,
normal shifts.
So you're back on the Kido.

829
00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:16.020
That must be it.
It's got to be the carbs,
the sugar.
Maybe your,

830
00:55:16.021 --> 00:55:20.250
what's that thing everyone has Ciliac I dunno.
Maybe.
What's that shit called,
man?

831
00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:22.550
The fucking gluten shit.
I know what you're talking.

832
00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:27.180
I've heard maybe have this irritant.
Isn't that what that is?
It's what?

833
00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:31.140
It just feels like I took care of itself.
It's like,
I know you changed your diet.

834
00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:33.330
No,
you're stopped eating that wheat.

835
00:55:33.331 --> 00:55:37.110
The gluten cut it out of your diet and that maybe you had a gluten intolerance.

836
00:55:37.111 --> 00:55:41.670
I don't know.
Who knows,
man.
But now I'm back to foreign like a man.
Oh Wow.

837
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:45.360
Here's a clip of you,
um,
from last night.

838
00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:46.980
<v 0>Oh yeah.
Yes.</v>

839
00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:50.903
<v 4>There's,
yeah,</v>

840
00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:57.460
that's definitely a Trish moment.
Gosh,
she really gets down that ground.

841
00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:02.740
Uh,
yeah.
You Nest?
He Fuck
No.

842
00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:07.540
Does anyone say that they love making,
I'm sure.

843
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:12.130
Yeah.
I mean personally it's a little too theatrical for my tastes.

844
00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:15.700
I would laugh really hard if you insist on being like,
yeah,

845
00:56:15.701 --> 00:56:20.470
you fucking nasty bitch.
I was like,
Oh,
I love to do that.

846
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:22.040
<v 0>Oh yeah,
yes.</v>

847
00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:41.710
Oh Wow.
That's not true.

848
00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:46.400
<v 3>True.
Bobby's a lot more abusive.
Here's Karen.</v>

849
00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:47.513
<v 10>Honestly,</v>

850
00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:54.240
it wasn't a town and this is like this ghost promise all of the moment in the

851
00:56:54.241 --> 00:56:57.780
scene.
It wasn't until somebody was actually there telling me,

852
00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:02.700
you have to in you or you have three of you that like it.
Actually,

853
00:57:02.701 --> 00:57:05.580
it kind of clicked and I'm like,
oh my God,
this is actually happening.

854
00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:07.860
I'm proud of myself.

855
00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:11.550
<v 3>Did you see,
by the way,
this was amazing Harlem.</v>

856
00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:16.560
I thought that the president of the United States called us out by name.

857
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:22.120
He did.
Yeah.
How did I miss this?
I Dunno,
but somebody sent it to me and I,

858
00:57:22.170 --> 00:57:23.150
my mouth dropped.

859
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:26.540
[inaudible] especially with everything going on right now to be directly

860
00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:31.400

It was,
it's pretty remarkable.
I can't wait to see this.
Wow.

<v 11>Well,

876
00:58:36.401 --> 00:58:41.360
signing revised travel ban.
Um,
and,
and a new,
uh,

877
00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:44.290
I guess there's,
there's a new policy about deportations as well.

878
00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:46.460
Have you seen this?
This is a new trend,

879
00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:50.650
<v 12>man.
Today was Sandy's Zegna oh,</v>

881
00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:58.650
We did pay him a,
we will be deported.

882
00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:01.680
We don't give a damn what got damn country.

883
00:59:01.681 --> 00:59:04.320
You go to a way your ass gone be in.

884
00:59:04.590 --> 00:59:09.590
We don't give a fuck looking at people stand up the land in front of you when

885
00:59:10.741 --> 00:59:14.580
they paying below the A's and the dro stuck in a booty.

886
00:59:14.890 --> 00:59:17.030
<v 3>Yeah,
that's a good,
that's a good law.</v>

887
00:59:17.090 --> 00:59:22.010
Well I think we should suggest this to the pres.
He's right.

888
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:25.550
<v 4>I mean yeah.
Suggests it looks like it's already about to become law</v>

889
00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:28.880
<v 12>to be stand up in front of you.</v>

890
00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:33.570
And he drove down to

891
00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:39.340
<v 4>truth.
That hair is amazing.</v>

892
00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:44.250
It's a really good,
a weird guy.
I don't know where he got it.
Yeah,

893
00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:44.901
<v 12>it looks good.</v>

894
00:59:44.901 --> 00:59:49.901
No longer have to look at it cause we use now to put an age and like I told you

895
00:59:50.811 --> 00:59:53.330
a mirror,
I got your bed.

896
00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:55.160
<v 4>I love the president.</v>

897
00:59:55.490 --> 01:00:00.490
The president to his outfits gotten better from 90s and he really seems to be

898
01:00:01.191 --> 01:00:04.370
getting into character.
This is great.
My favorite thing is that,
you know,

899
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:07.640
now him and us together,
we run into industry now,
you know,

900
01:00:07.641 --> 01:00:08.710
we're running this industry.

901
01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:11.900
How great would it be if this guy really did give like all the talks,

902
01:00:12.090 --> 01:00:13.010
all the speeches,

903
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:16.310
take over the Twitter at Cambia approval rating would be much higher,

904
01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.710
much.
I would love this guy to be president.
Actually,

905
01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:23.570
I'm going to keep the motherfuckers out.

906
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:30.470
That's the new,
uh,
that's the new travel ban.
Anybody from any of those countries,

907
01:00:30.471 --> 01:00:32.960
we don't keep them motherfuckers out and keep them out.
Man.

908
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:35.600
Running the industry now.
I love it.

909
01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:41.360
He's really the greatest [inaudible] is growing on me now.
I mean,

910
01:00:41.361 --> 01:00:44.210
now that we got to shout out and everything,
it's pretty crazy.

911
01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:47.150
Maybe it's my vanity,
but he appealed to it and I like it.

912
01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:52.260
Do you remember the guy that taught us Oi Oi Mandarin course?
Yeah.

913
01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:57.290
He's got another one out.
What's up fam?
Blood blood oil.

914
01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.273
Mandan.

915
01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.420
<v 9>Yes.
You're like a lush today.</v>

916
01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:07.450
I'm off to ask or to get some Zider.
I've arrived in bristle trust drive.

917
01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:12.520
Hello Ron.
This is Philly.
Today I'm going to talk about Bristol dialect.
Was

918
01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:17.480
<v 4>Bristol stool chart words?
Yeah.
Bristo Bristol.
It's the same Bristol,</v>

919
01:01:17.481 --> 01:01:21.440
by the way.
Right?
Is the Bristol stool chart came from?
Wow.
Is that,

920
01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:26.420
wow.
I did not put that together.
How do you think Bristol's proud of that?

921
01:01:26.421 --> 01:01:30.620
That they 100% of course.
Is there a museum commemorating the chart?

922
01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:34.020
Possibly.
Possibly,
yeah.

923
01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:35.450
<v 9>All right,
let's hear it.</v>

924
01:01:35.451 --> 01:01:39.230
You need to remember that Bristol is called Bristol by local people because of

925
01:01:39.231 --> 01:01:39.930
the action

926
01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:42.280
<v 4>appraisal.
Brazil,
Brazil,
Brazil.</v>

927
01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:47.120
<v 9>The best one is a phrase and it's our big,
it looks like a different language,</v>

928
01:01:47.121 --> 01:01:51.500
right?
It's from the phrase how beat and it means how long.
Oh,

929
01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:56.740
it's useful that they can person in old English in Bristol.
Phil uses it.

930
01:01:56.970 --> 01:02:00.340
<v 4>Oh,
you mean in Bristol?
Braise our best.</v>

931
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:03.030
<v 9>So next one is</v>

932
01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:10.140
in Bristolian mean very old people in Bristol Sake or at lush,

933
01:02:11.111 --> 01:02:12.120
which means very good.

934
01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:16.110
<v 4>Good,
lush.
Good God,
Norbert.
Oh,
me mate.</v>

935
01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:22.020
I guess get good.
Sounds like good.
Is that why good?
It's good.

936
01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:26.090
Gosh,
Gosh,
this is really specific.
Jeez man.
Damn.

937
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:27.930
My whole thing is do you think the people,

938
01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:32.550
the most hilarious thing would be people watching this video in what?

939
01:02:32.551 --> 01:02:35.910
Korean,
he's Korean are traveling there and being like,

940
01:02:36.810 --> 01:02:41.810
or gut lush like to go get rush.

941
01:02:43.350 --> 01:02:47.250
No.
Lush,
nope,

942
01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:52.440
you're doing it wrong.
Let's take a look at an example sentence.
Hey,

943
01:02:52.441 --> 01:02:56.130
how are you?
You look very good today.
I'll bet you'll like her lunch today.

944
01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:58.470
So damn.
But,

945
01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:02.680
but nothing was more absurd than a foreigner trying slang,
you know,

946
01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:06.210
cause he's keys working at a double deficit like will and the people he's

947
01:03:06.211 --> 01:03:09.960
teaching art are definitely,
should not be trying to,

948
01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:13.650
cause if you're a traveling they're negative and then they're going to be like,

949
01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:15.640
oh you look great girl.

950
01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:19.610
Lush today we're going to look like a fucking asshole.
Yeah.

951
01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:21.660
Yeah.
It's a,
I mean it's,

952
01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:26.840
it's entertaining but our cookie from old English and it usually means look at

953
01:03:28.261 --> 01:03:33.030
him.
Okay.
It's from the word Hawk.
Come on.
Listen.

954
01:03:33.031 --> 01:03:33.900
In old English

955
01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:42.010
I can't,
they just talk normal walk at e.
Okay.
Okay.

956
01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:45.900
Is that really what's happening now?
I feel like,

957
01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:49.320
I feel like it's learning slang from the Internet.
Like,

958
01:03:49.321 --> 01:03:51.930
you know when you're like fleek and you're like,
yeah,

959
01:03:51.931 --> 01:03:55.500
but nobody's really saying that shit.
I don't know.
I mean,
or whatever.

960
01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:59.430
I feel like this is the answer net equivalent of what's cool cause we,

961
01:03:59.431 --> 01:04:03.510
whenever we air this guy,
we usually get emails like nobody really says,
man,

962
01:04:03.511 --> 01:04:07.470
dumb or that's so nineties or that's not what really is happening.

963
01:04:08.730 --> 01:04:10.560
Stop stops.
You might think,
oh,

964
01:04:10.561 --> 01:04:15.561
fishing when you hear this related to fishing in Bristolian means playing souls.

965
01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:19.000
It's a fucking one.

966
01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:26.310
Oh for fuck off.
Fuck.
Do you,
um,

967
01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:29.310
do you think his sweatshirt looks like he's on a new season of Star Trek?

968
01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:33.960
You told me.
Oh my God,
I tried on a zip up jacket,
you know,

969
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:37.070
like a casual zip,
zip her upper and you're like,

970
01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:42.110
you're on the new season of star was look like seven of nine or whatever.

971
01:04:42.421 --> 01:04:46.380
Fucking stupid character named seven of nine.
Is that what her name is?

972
01:04:46.381 --> 01:04:49.730
I don't know.
Is that really a name?
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.

973
01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:55.020
A guy from reading rainbow and he had on a banana comb on his,

974
01:04:55.021 --> 01:04:58.230
over his eyes and that was his like thing.
And you're like,

975
01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:03.660
fuck a banana comb on that guy's eyes.
Yeah,
that's what he always wore his jam.

976
01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:06.120
That's not even a thing.
Right.
Here we go again.

977
01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:10.290
Here we go with the jam here.

978
01:05:10.690 --> 01:05:13.560
When we found pictures of Garth Brooks with his first wife

979
01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:18.040
Julie Moon.
And

980
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.280
<v 13>this will be my wicked witch.
Laughter video.</v>

981
01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:26.550
<v 4>Hi Aaron.
I hold on.
I mean you can't just why?
What happened?</v>

982
01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:29.670
I feel like you needed to set me up a little.
I don't know what it is.

983
01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:33.020
Why are you not preparing?
I don't know what it is.
I know it was Julie Moon.
Now.

984
01:05:33.090 --> 01:05:35.040
Dammit.
Hold on.
Let me get comfortable.

985
01:05:35.041 --> 01:05:39.660
I got to like sit back a little and fucking ease into something crazy like this.

986
01:05:39.661 --> 01:05:42.030
Yeah,
you didn't tell me we are going full crazy.
Yeah.

987
01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:47.330
<v 13>I used to be famous for doing this laugh in college.
Can you'll remember?</v>

988
01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:52.200
Oh Shit.
Okay.
And this is my maleficent head dress wearing,

989
01:05:52.550 --> 01:05:55.070
which I like to put it on Halloween and scare the crap out of little kids.

990
01:05:55.810 --> 01:05:59.950
<v 4>What is there going?
What's going on?
There is a pronoun.</v>

991
01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:04.950
<v 13>Yup.
And this is what having a stressful day does to Julie Moon.
Oh,</v>

992
01:06:04.951 --> 01:06:07.440
and I'm naked,
but this is all you're seeing up here.

993
01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:12.350
<v 4>Oh,
okay.
Oh,
so it is okay.
Just be like,
Hey,
hi.
How are you?</v>

994
01:06:12.351 --> 01:06:14.720
What's your name?
What's Your Pronoun?
Cause there's a little,

995
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:19.160
there's a little confusion.
I'm confused,
but it's not a is Julie.
No.

996
01:06:19.161 --> 01:06:23.180
Now we know because I'm naked.
But this is all you're seeing Julie.

997
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:28.480
Now you know it's a woman.
Yeah.
But there was a little confusion.
I was,

998
01:06:28.510 --> 01:06:30.730
if you're listening only you,
you can't tell you.

999
01:06:30.731 --> 01:06:33.120
It's definitely sounds like a woman,
but if you're,
you're viewing you,

1000
01:06:33.121 --> 01:06:37.100
you know what I mean?
What's Your Pronoun?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
No.
Okay.

1001
01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.073
<v 13>Get ready.</v>

1002
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:49.830
<v 4>That's a good character.
That's really good.
But yeah,</v>

1003
01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:53.690
what's up with the dental update?
You know,
uh,
I gotta tell you,

1004
01:06:53.691 --> 01:06:55.560
you got to get those teeth fixed,
man.

1005
01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:58.850
That's the thing about the great British baking show.
I meant to right now.

1006
01:06:58.851 --> 01:07:02.340
And yeah,
I watched one with you last night.
Finally.
I got you on board.

1007
01:07:02.341 --> 01:07:06.100
Now it almost feels like you indulge in sweets after you watch that show.

1008
01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:07.710
Since we don't eat carbs anymore,

1009
01:07:07.711 --> 01:07:10.510
I feel like at least I can watch people baking them a soap,

1010
01:07:10.890 --> 01:07:14.940
but their teeth are so fucking gnarly.
Julie's our bad.

1011
01:07:14.970 --> 01:07:17.520
Julie's are bad too,
but yeah,
I support you.

1012
01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.010
But I support a dental visit.

1013
01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:24.530
<v 13>And just for your viewing pleasure,
I'm showing in a bonus.</v>

1014
01:07:24.830 --> 01:07:27.830
Generally evil doing maniacal type laugh.

1015
01:07:35.090 --> 01:07:39.190
<v 4>Oof.
I liked the first lap was good for his laugh was better the second,</v>

1016
01:07:39.850 --> 01:07:42.680
the second lap when,
no,
no.

1017
01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:45.790
I'm thinking from an animation casting standpoint,
right.

1018
01:07:46.210 --> 01:07:50.110
That's not a strong voice.
No,
the first one was good though.
Yeah.

1019
01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:54.740
Someone took hammers to her.
Deserves teeth.
Yeah.

1020
01:07:56.550 --> 01:07:58.060
It doesn't like it then.

1021
01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:02.890
Now the thing is you can get those invisaligns now and I think there are a

1022
01:08:02.891 --> 01:08:05.380
fraction of the cost of what braces were.
Yeah.

1023
01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:10.000
So now there's really little excuse people and why not just get the perfect

1024
01:08:10.001 --> 01:08:14.560
smile.
Yeah.
Then I mean,
you can,
uh,
you can get him,

1025
01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:15.770
we're a date,

1026

<v 3>but you,
you can eat</v>

1027
01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:24.000
<v 4>Jannie.
You can't smile too hard.
You can't eat,
you can't drink.</v>

I mean we,

1083
01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:53.070
I know we mentioned it last week,

01:11:53.071 --> 01:11:56.830
And W I mean,
I don't know,
maybe we did,
but it's enough.
It's,

1085
01:11:56.890 --> 01:12:01.890
it's big enough to emphasize that it might be that you just have to dehydrate

yourself.
No,

Good a night away.
So good.

1095
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:39.620
We slept and slept til eight.
Awesome.
That was amazing.
I fell asleep.

1096
01:12:39.770 --> 01:12:42.930
I fell asleep at 10 and woke up at eight.
That's the longest I've slept in,

1097
01:12:43.710 --> 01:12:48.110
I would say easily two years.
And I mean that like that,
you know,

1098
01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:52.080
especially cause you can't really relax with the kid in the house.

1099
01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:53.540
You got to get out of the house.

1100
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:56.370
You got to go to a hotel or go or someone take baby.

1101
01:12:56.850 --> 01:13:00.630
Because if I hear him even like running around,
it's,
you're still in.

1102
01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:01.560
I'm still in mom though.

1103
01:13:01.561 --> 01:13:06.240
Of course you can't even nap when you hear a kid like making noise.
Really?

1104
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:08.820
No,
it was great.
Yeah.
So anyways,

1105
01:13:08.821 --> 01:13:11.700
we made a reservation again next month,

1106
01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:16.380
once a month we're going to spend the night away and we're going to just rest

1107
01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:21.360
and it's drank during the day.
It was fucking awesome.
I never do that anymore.

1108
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.291
I mean,

1109
01:13:22.291 --> 01:13:27.291
by that I mean like I had to hold glasses of wine before sundown and then one,

1110
01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:32.640
uh,
with dinner and I was like,
I'm ripped.
I'm hammered.

1111
01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:36.980
It was really,
really fun,
man.
God Damn.
We were only,
you know,

1112
01:13:37.410 --> 01:13:39.270
20 minutes away.

1113
01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:42.690
That's the best part is that it's really close to where we live.

1114
01:13:42.691 --> 01:13:47.691
And then we had Sushi for dinner and the best part is that we ordered a fuck

1115
01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:52.770
load of Sushi and our waiter didn't,
judge,

1116
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:56.370
didn't judge it all kept suggesting things,
give it,

1117
01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:59.850
gave us things that weren't on the menu,
created things for us.

1118
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:05.240
And at the very end goes,
thanks chains.
Yeah,

1119
01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:08.580
we're like,
what?
What?
This whole time.
He's like,
yeah,
mommy,

1120
01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:10.920
this is a fucking,

1121
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:16.510
<v 3>first of all,
we're always pleased to meet a mommy in any corner of the world,</v>

1122
01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:21.260
but your Sushi server,
come on.
That's perfect for us.
It's symbiotic.
Yeah,

1123
01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:25.540
it was,
it,
it totally changed the whole,
you know,
well,

1124
01:14:25.630 --> 01:14:30.100
just finally to not be judged for the amount of food that we've been ordering at

1125
01:14:30.101 --> 01:14:33.210
Sushi cause we've been ordering a lot.
It was real cool.
Yeah.

1126
01:14:33.211 --> 01:14:35.890
And he gave us dessert and everything.
Oh,

1127
01:14:35.891 --> 01:14:40.360
so good craze craze jeans.
Um,

1128
01:14:42.850 --> 01:14:43.960
having a lot of laughs too.

1129
01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:46.950
<v 16>The missile knows where it is at all times.</v>

1130
01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:52.320
It knows this because it knows where it isn't,
where it is from,

1131
01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:56.310
where it isn't or where it isn't from where it is,
whichever is greater,

1132
01:14:56.670 --> 01:14:59.130
it obtains a difference or deviation.

1133
01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:05.260
<v 3>Yeah.
Wow.
That was boring.
What do you think?
That didn't even make sense?
Yeah.</v>

1134
01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:10.880
<v 16>The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective command to drive</v>

1135
01:15:11.221 --> 01:15:15.060
the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't.

1136
01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:18.570
And arriving at a position where it wasn't,
it now is

1137
01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:21.990
<v 3>this reminds me,
right.
The voice.</v>

1138
01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:26.140
That voice over guy reminds me so much of school.
Right.
That's a school.

1139
01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:30.420
It's a school video,
voice to Boring driveways and then do you,

1140
01:15:30.450 --> 01:15:33.870
would you ever look back and go,
was any of that worth it?
Any of those things?

1141
01:15:33.871 --> 01:15:36.330
I learned cause somewhere,
but don't you feel like someone,
you're like,

1142
01:15:36.331 --> 01:15:38.610
I didn't need to learn any of that shit.
There's a lot that,

1143
01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:42.360
it's not practical knowledge,
but I will say it.
It makes your brain,

1144
01:15:42.361 --> 01:15:46.110
it's like brain gymnastics so that you can retain and understand things.

1145
01:15:46.111 --> 01:15:49.500
It's just gymnastics and I guess so,
but you don't remember any of that shit.

1146
01:15:49.530 --> 01:15:51.600
I like this.
They would teach you something like this and you're like,

1147
01:15:51.601 --> 01:15:53.040
this fucking sucks now.

1148
01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:56.010
I don't know why they have to phrase it that way from where it is to where it

1149
01:15:56.011 --> 01:15:58.170
isn't to where it was to where it works.
Huh?

1150
01:15:58.230 --> 01:16:02.550
<v 16>Sequentially.
The position where it is is now the position that it wasn't,</v>

1151
01:16:02.690 --> 01:16:07.080
I didn't know shit.
The position that it was is now the position that it isn't.

1152
01:16:07.710 --> 01:16:11.710
<v 3>This is like
this.
It makes them no sense.</v>

1153
01:16:12.090 --> 01:16:13.180
That's the missile

1154
01:16:13.710 --> 01:16:18.090
<v 16>in the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't.</v>

1155
01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:20.760
The system has acquired a variation.

1156
01:16:21.390 --> 01:16:25.260
The variation being the difference between where the missile is and we're at

1157
01:16:25.261 --> 01:16:27.650
wasn't it?
Variation is,

1158
01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:31.690
<v 3>I feel like this is,
um,
that's how an engineer's brain work for something.
Yeah.</v>

1159
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:36.520
This is why smart people were then the muscles and they go,
this is exciting.
So,

1160
01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:38.060
and this is fun.
Yeah.

1161
01:16:38.250 --> 01:16:42.950
But this is why dumb dumbs like us don't have our finger on the button of these

1162
01:16:42.951 --> 01:16:45.830
things and smart people do.
This is more our speed right here.

1163
01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.630
Imagine if some Dukie going,

1164
01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:53.600
<v 17>welcome free.
Yes.</v>

1165
01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:58.880
<v 3>Yeah.
Lit a torch to loosen this pipe.
You know,</v>

1166
01:16:59.210 --> 01:17:03.020
you'll be out.
Right.
And the guide doesn't heat it up.
Not talking about it.

1167
01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:05.450
Stop talking about it.

1168
01:17:06.050 --> 01:17:11.030
<v 17>It's a chain
as the,
that sacco,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1169
01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:15.530
There's some pipe in the base.
Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
So see,
it's leaking already.
Yeah.

1170
01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:20.150
You're calm.
You're calm.
Maybe stand back.

1171
01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:24.830
Dude.
There's no time to throw up right now.
He's not going to tell a lie.

1172
01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:28.970
He doesn't,
he doesn't work through it.
Don't lie to me.
He's just grossed out.

1173
01:17:29.450 --> 01:17:31.860
He's just grossed out.
Work through it.
You've got this right.

1174
01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:34.970
<v 4>Hey,
dry.
Even close.
Why are you showing me a fucking Barf club dues?</v>

1175
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:39.900
Is that a Barf clip?
His friends just laughing at how gross Goudy is.

1176
01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:44.653
<v 18>Wow.</v>

1177
01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:53.970
<v 4>That's an evil character,
by the way.
That's a malesan capital and I go,</v>

1178
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:56.950
why are you showing me the fucking bomb?
And it doesn't vomit.

1179
01:17:56.990 --> 01:18:01.890
He's bending over like he's,
well,
he's grossed out.
That's the whole point.
Yeah.

1180
01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:06.970
Don't have vomit.
No promise.
Next a clip.
Oh Huh.
Huh.
Huh.
Huh.

1181
01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:09.273
Hmm.

1182
01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:13.420
<v 3>I feel like he does what?
That guy.
Oh,
you feel like him?</v>

1183
01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:17.590
<v 17>Yeah.
Great.
What do you think's in that pipe dude?
His Fred.</v>

1184
01:18:17.591 --> 01:18:22.530
He's just fucking with him.
It's the best.
Where do you think,

1185
01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:31.150
<v 3>can you imagine about,
isn't it funny that that's his line of work?
Sewage?
Well,</v>

1186
01:18:31.151 --> 01:18:35.140
I mean the guy's so grossed out by a lot like his line of work.

1187
01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:37.500
It not like this is the first pipe.
He's done that too.

1188
01:18:37.530 --> 01:18:40.900
Is this his line of work or it will look,
he's a novice.
He knows what he's doing,

1189
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:45.010
I guess.
I mean,
he,
he,
he took the thing off.
He's,
he's cleaning.

1190
01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:47.390
<v 17>Get out now.
Show floor.</v>

1191
01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.140
Juki sitting on the floor.

1192
01:18:58.770 --> 01:18:59.660
<v 19>Oh,
shut the fuck.</v>

1193
01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:05.730
<v 4>I mean,
wouldn't you where I'm at.
Okay.
I'm out.</v>

1194
01:19:05.731 --> 01:19:09.600
I'm fucking tapped out of his club,
bro.
Why?
What is wrong with you?

1195
01:19:09.601 --> 01:19:13.290
You're ruining the show right now.
You're ruining the show.

1196
01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:17.280
You're ruining the show.
You know,
I hate,
I haven't seen this though,
right?

1197
01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:18.663
<v 3>No,
I haven't.</v>

1198
01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:22.110
<v 4>I have no blue.
Bam prepared it and you know,
I'll do it.
Yeah.</v>

1199
01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.310
<v 17>Okay,
awesome.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.</v>

1200
01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:28.530
This dude chuck is,

1201
01:19:30.090 --> 01:19:33.600
<v 4>Oh,
I'm going to get a Goddamn,
wait,
no,
no,
no.
It's over.
It's not over.
Liar</v>

1202
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:38.180
<v 3>over God.
Here's a worst.
This is for you.</v>

1203
01:19:38.210 --> 01:19:39.380
Just to go back to this,

1204
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:44.140
<v 19>oh,
hello and welcome to another edition of her Reba Robin Academy.</v>

1205
01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:50.040
This installment will discuss Raman spectroscopy and specifically micro Raman

1206
01:19:50.141 --> 01:19:52.550
spectroscopy.
Jesus.
Yes,

1207
01:19:52.650 --> 01:19:56.860
we buy it to molecular electronic material.

1208
01:19:58.150 --> 01:20:00.640
You'd rather watch this then the Duke you guys all day.

1209
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:05.560
<v 3>Of course,
air day,
Jesus,
defects of orientation and crystallinity.</v>

1210
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.950
There's videos like Reba Romine Academy,
one in the world.
Is this,

1211
01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:15.780
this is just a short cover,
these topics,

1212
01:20:16.170 --> 01:20:21.090
uh,
first,
uh,
an introduction or reintroduction,
I'm sure to many of you,

1213
01:20:21.490 --> 01:20:23.500
the field effect transistor,
you know,
uh,

1214
01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:28.350
my dad called me this week and there's amaze me lab.

1215
01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:32.760
He read me jokes.
Oh No.
Oh yeah.
I got to get them to record it.
No,

1216
01:20:32.761 --> 01:20:37.500
he called me like I was driving and he was laughing so hard and I was like,

1217
01:20:37.501 --> 01:20:39.330
where are you?
How are you memorizing these?

1218
01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:44.680
Cause like not guy emailed me Matt Green Gay and he was getting them wrong as he

1219
01:20:44.941 --> 01:20:48.700
read them.
I go,
that's not how that joke out.
He's like,
oh well,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

1220
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:54.000
yeah.
Like stumbling over it.
He's like more or less.
That's the job.
More or less.

1221
01:20:54.001 --> 01:20:58.830
Yeah.
Isn't that funny?
You got to get it right though.
For it to be funny.

1222
01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:03.510
Jokes are all about precision.
Yeah.
Uh,
you know,
so fun.
I do what I was thinking,

1223
01:21:03.511 --> 01:21:05.350
how stupid I am.
How you were saying.
Yeah.

1224
01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:07.240
Do you remember any of this shit from school?
Yeah.

1225
01:21:07.250 --> 01:21:11.190
Like if our sun were to ask me,
hey,
why does it rain?
I'll be like,

1226
01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:14.790
I don't fucking know.

Right.
I'm like,
no,

1227
01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:17.430
I really don't.
I'm not sure how to do long form division.

1228
01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:19.410
I can't fucking do that shit.
I'd be like,

1229
01:21:19.450 --> 01:21:24.310
I remember you think you got to carry something.
Remainders is a remainder to,

1230
01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:27.360
okay.
You want to see a funny video?
So this in class tomorrow,

1231
01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:32.670
this uh,
why is the sky blue?
Uh,

1232
01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:37.260
I don't fucking know this cause the light Google this guy cause light hits this

1233
01:21:37.261 --> 01:21:41.010

Yeah.
So I would say what causes rainbows,
son?

1234
01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:43.740
The gaze piss the air and it makes it blue.

1235
01:21:47.050 --> 01:21:51.900
The gays,

So that's why,

1236
01:21:52.450 --> 01:21:57.420

1237
01:21:57.750 --> 01:22:00.180
Oh yeah.
A chicken in the pool.

1238
01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:21.320
There you go.
There's an excited dad that dads can't curse to get,

1239
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:24.620
Dad's got a say.
Fricking fricking cool.
Fricking clue.

1240
01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:25.993
<v 17>Good.
Cool.</v>

1241
01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:30.680
<v 3>Your Dad doesn't talk like that.
Come on now.
My Dad's a real man.
Yeah,</v>

1242
01:22:30.770 --> 01:22:33.020
he doesn't say frigging at all.
There's no such,

1243
01:22:33.021 --> 01:22:36.110
I don't think my dad knows the word frickin.
Yeah.
He'd say like,

1244
01:22:36.111 --> 01:22:39.140
why the fuck do you say fricking?
Yeah,
of course.
Yeah.
You know,

1245
01:22:39.141 --> 01:22:43.400
I kind of am of that school.
I don't know.
We'll see how my kid turns out,

1246
01:22:43.401 --> 01:22:48.320
but yeah,
I'm cares.
Let him say fuck word with somebody right here.

1247
01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:52.310
Um,
hey mommy's,
I'm writing to let you know that Rick would,

1248
01:22:52.311 --> 01:22:55.610
the xannies is almost 100%.

1249
01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:57.680
I can't put this person is better than we are.

1250
01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:01.790
The same guy who texted you a few a few months ago,
sticks on deck.

1251
01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:06.680
Oh Shit.
In my opinion,
he should have gone Lincoln.
Ah,

1252
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:11.170
as a favorite of mommy.
And you could text Rick and let him know.
I keep,

1253
01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:14.950
I need 10 keeping them high and tight from Virginia.
Alex,

1254
01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.980
I didn't even put that shit to.
Yeah,
thanks Bro.

1255
01:23:18.010 --> 01:23:22.960
That's so I didn't even realize sticks animal.
What were the stakes again?

1256
01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:26.230
Xanax.
Ah,
shit man.
Linkedin is helpful.

1257
01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:31.390
So there you go,
Alex.
Thank you very much.
Thank you,
Dan.

1258
01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:34.300
Hey mommies.
I have,
uh,

1259
01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:38.170
I don't have anyone that I feel like an ass about this in my personal life.

1260
01:23:38.890 --> 01:23:42.610
And you always seem to have rock solid advice on things like this.

1261
01:23:42.611 --> 01:23:46.330
I have issues with my ass.
It itches sometimes,

1262
01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:49.330
which I think is kind of normal,

1263
01:23:49.690 --> 01:23:53.130
but I also have issues making Brown.
Oh,

1264
01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:55.210
the cleaning up part more specifically,

1265
01:23:55.211 --> 01:23:58.810
I noticed when a coworker comes in to make chocolate next to me,

1266
01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:03.070
they wipe way less than I do.
I could just be,

1267
01:24:03.071 --> 01:24:06.850
it could just be that they don't require the cleanliness that I do.

1268
01:24:06.910 --> 01:24:09.870
Or it could be the amount of hair I have on my asshole.
Hmm.

1269
01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:14.020
I need a good four or five pieces of toilet paper and I average a good three

1270
01:24:14.021 --> 01:24:15.400
wipes per piece.

1271
01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:19.090
Others sound like they wipe two or three times total.

1272
01:24:19.630 --> 01:24:22.240
It seems like I work way harder than them to not,

1273
01:24:22.270 --> 01:24:24.900
not to mention smashing hair into my asshole.

1274
01:24:24.910 --> 01:24:29.770
It's like rubbing it with a what?
A pad causing it to bleed.

1275
01:24:29.771 --> 01:24:34.771
Sometimes wood shaving my ass be a recommendation you would recommend at this.

1276
01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:39.880
Well you would make at this point.
Thanks.
Genes love the podcast.
Joel.
Joel,

1277
01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:44.520
interesting question and I would do is really your leg.

1278
01:24:44.890 --> 01:24:47.770
Oh it is 100% in my lane.
I drive.

1279
01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:52.330
I've been down this path many times.
There's two things I can tell you.

1280
01:24:52.331 --> 01:24:56.890
First of all,
the answer is yes.
I think,
um,

1281
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:59.650
I know I've done it before.

1282
01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:03.370
Sometimes you hear me talking about it like I got to make that appointment
again.

1283
01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:04.540
I got to get that done again.

1284
01:25:05.050 --> 01:25:09.060
It absolutely changes your cleanup game,

1285
01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:12.850
your cleanup game.
When you have a hairy asshole.

1286
01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:17.740
It's not fun.
It's time consuming.
It's a,
it's honestly,

1287
01:25:17.741 --> 01:25:22.120
it's stressful and losing all that hair.
I mean you'll,

1288
01:25:22.150 --> 01:25:25.660
you would be amazed.
I would consider,
I wouldn't,
I would actually wax it.

1289
01:25:25.661 --> 01:25:30.040
And here's why.
It sounds scarier than it is.
Um,

1290
01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:33.760
you think is going to be like this unbearable pain.
It's not,
it just feels like,

1291
01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:37.690
like just,
yeah,
you just feel a little tug.
It's not any more.

1292
01:25:37.691 --> 01:25:41.860
It's not someone's stabbing your asshole.
The hairs come out like anywhere else.

1293
01:25:41.861 --> 01:25:46.270
It feels fine.
I would recommend doing it.
The other part of it though.

1294
01:25:46.271 --> 01:25:47.500
I think the drawback,

1295
01:25:48.910 --> 01:25:52.600
some people will tell you you're going to maybe sweat more or cause there's

1296
01:25:52.601 --> 01:25:56.050
nothing there to collect it.
No,
I think it's definitely a a reasonable thing.

1297
01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:00.550
But as we mentioned earlier in this podcast,

1298
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.040
maybe a diet change.
That's what

1299
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.170
<v 4>I was going to suggest.</v>

1300
01:26:05.690 --> 01:26:10.340
What's coming out of your asshole.

1301
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:11.030
Yeah,

1302
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:15.410
let's start with the root cause here because don't you feel like waxing his bud

1303
01:26:15.411 --> 01:26:19.070
hair is,
it's,
it's an effect.
Not the cause.

1304
01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:21.170
Like let's get to the root.
Well,

1305
01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:24.560
but it's still either way it's going to change other way it's going to change.

1306
01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:25.533
It is it.

1307
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:30.260
And also I recommend as somebody who went shit to shower for a years because I

1308
01:26:30.261 --> 01:26:31.280
have a clean ass hole.

1309
01:26:31.281 --> 01:26:36.281
I have a hairless asshole more or less and my wipes were disastrous for a long

1310
01:26:36.681 --> 01:26:38.210
time and I would just go,
shit,

1311
01:26:38.211 --> 01:26:42.860
the showers we mentioned maybe consider investing in a toto washlet for your

1312
01:26:42.861 --> 01:26:47.000
home,
but then you get to work and it's like,
well why are you shitting?

1313
01:26:47.001 --> 01:26:50.030
I think you should move your shitting schedule.
Shit in the morning,

1314
01:26:50.031 --> 01:26:52.580
drink your coffee and then you're not shooting at work.
Can you?

1315
01:26:52.610 --> 01:26:54.710
Can you move around?
You're dumping schedule's a little

1316
01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:57.340
<v 3>Nah,
I mean it's a possibility.
I would say that.</v>

1317
01:26:57.370 --> 01:26:59.080
I think just for a life experience.

1318
01:26:59.290 --> 01:27:02.080
Try Waxing your ass ones if you're a hairy guy.
Yeah,

1319
01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:06.730
and I would say since it's a work toilet and who gives a fuck?
If you clog it,

1320
01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:11.500
bring some wipes.
You can bring wipes you,
I think you can do an easy way.

1321
01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:15.160
Bring a bottle of water with you into the bathroom.

1322
01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:19.750
Topdog and what are you bringing about spit in the toilet paper.

1323
01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:23.620
He can bring water into the bottle of water with a cap on it.
Why not?

1324
01:27:23.621 --> 01:27:25.030
That's disgusting.
No,

1325
01:27:25.031 --> 01:27:29.080
it's not for a little bit of that on there and you just,
you lose.

1326
01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:34.030
I do it all the time when I'm traveling.
Of course.
What are you talking about?

1327
01:27:34.031 --> 01:27:38.350
Like in an airport?
What are you talking about?
You're shitting in a stall.

1328
01:27:38.430 --> 01:27:41.560
I don't even know.
What are you talking about?
I feel like you're a stranger.

1329
01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:44.740
I do spit on the paper.
If I'm in there and I don't have water,

1330
01:27:44.741 --> 01:27:49.060
but if I have water I'll pour it on the paper and then wipe my ass with that.

1331
01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:54.580
Yeah.
Okay.
Let's also discuss the inferior quality of office.
Toilet paper.

1332
01:27:54.581 --> 01:27:57.640
Horrible.
Horrible.
Don't,
don't judge.
First of all,

1333
01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:02.000
all never judge your cleanup amount with your neighbors cleaning.

1334
01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:06.850
I agree with that.
We got to stay in your own cleanup lane it sounds like.

1335
01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:10.930
Yeah.
The person next to you is doing less but maybe they're lazy,

1336
01:28:10.931 --> 01:28:15.780
you don't know and inferior.
They're just trying to paper different.

1337
01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:19.510
Come in their balls and maybe you don't.

1338
01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:22.770
<v 4>Now your cleanup is going to be different at the office because of the inferior</v>

1339
01:28:22.771 --> 01:28:26.160
quality of toilet paper.
Keep that in mind.
Try not to judge yourself.

1340
01:28:26.161 --> 01:28:29.250
Try not to be so hard on yourself with how much toilet paper you're using.

1341
01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:32.760
Cause you got to use double the squares.
If it's a single ply.

1342
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:33.960
Everybody knows this.

1343
01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:34.790
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1344
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:37.950
You got to use a lot of toilet paper in the office and in an airport you go

1345
01:28:37.951 --> 01:28:40.520
through half a brought his own role.
Uh,

1346
01:28:40.521 --> 01:28:43.770
I mean the thing is you got to manage that role,
you know,
but I would,

1347
01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:48.430
I would definitely bring water or wet wipes into wet wipes,

1348
01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:52.450
<v 4>wet wipes.
I might even suggest,
uh,
you know,</v>

1349
01:28:52.451 --> 01:28:56.280
going to rite aid and getting a little thing of personal kleenex.
Yeah.

1350
01:28:56.510 --> 01:28:57.260
Cause that's

1351
01:28:57.260 --> 01:29:02.210
<v 3>[inaudible] then office toilet paper.
Yeah.
Interesting.
Interesting.</v>

1352
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.730
Yeah.

1353
01:29:02.730 --> 01:29:06.690
<v 4>I like your idea of,
of bringing a water.
It's just kind of,
I feel conspicuous.</v>

1354
01:29:06.691 --> 01:29:09.060
Will people notice what he's doing?
I don't think they'll,

1355
01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:11.400
I don't think they pay attention.
They won't know.

1356
01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:14.290
<v 3>No,
he just drank it.
You walk around your water and then he'd go in there,</v>

1357
01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:17.300
take it in the can.
No,

1358
01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:22.510
somebody emailed this.
Thank you for that very thought provoking question.

1359
01:29:22.511 --> 01:29:24.700
I could spend all day talking about that question.

1360
01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:29.530
I am an insurance adjuster for property casualty and liability claims.

1361
01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:31.510
Unfortunately,
boring video.
No,
no.

1362
01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:34.390
Unfortunately I could not record this for legal reasons,

1363
01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:38.350
but that was in a house yesterday and it was a good two hour drive to get to the

1364
01:29:38.351 --> 01:29:40.420
location on the way down.

1365
01:29:40.421 --> 01:29:44.110
I was listening to them cast and almost out of reflex.

1366
01:29:44.590 --> 01:29:49.030
The misses of the house offered me a water and I thanked her s saying,

1367
01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:53.290
thanks jeans.
And she said,
third.
She said,

1368
01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:57.790
sure thing mommy,
a look was exchange and we started laughing.

1369
01:29:57.880 --> 01:29:58.900
Needless to say,

1370
01:29:58.901 --> 01:30:03.190
the inspection took longer than expected as we proceeded to use and most of the

1371
01:30:03.191 --> 01:30:05.080
cash wages while discussing her claim.

1372
01:30:05.710 --> 01:30:09.370
If my son wins his regional wrestling tournament this weekend,

1373
01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:14.380
I will send the video because it is bound to be a huge dad boner on my part.

1374
01:30:14.770 --> 01:30:18.900
Stay classy and Tom is the water and personality camp.

1375
01:30:19.270 --> 01:30:23.350
Love your genes.
Rob,
will rob.
Good luck to your son.

1376
01:30:23.351 --> 01:30:27.550
I hope you have a huge dead boner and lose your mind if he wins.

1377
01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:31.990
By the way,
we got sent in of course more.
Do you want to see some,

1378
01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:33.250
hey mommy's thanks.
Jeans or

1379
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:35.670
<v 4>Horace.
I love these.
These are my favorite.
First of all,</v>

1380
01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:40.700
there's also been some chatter out there on the interwebs that I might be the

1381
01:30:40.741 --> 01:30:43.460
burp champion.
Who the fuck is saying that?
You know,

1382
01:30:43.470 --> 01:30:46.350
just people from last week's Promo on Instagram.

1383
01:30:46.590 --> 01:30:50.100
A lot of let's just a lot of activity,

1384
01:30:50.101 --> 01:30:53.370
people insinuating that I might be the burp champ,

1385
01:30:53.910 --> 01:30:57.600
just glass and they're just thinking about it.
I don't think that,
I don't know.

1386
01:30:57.601 --> 01:31:01.470
I'm not encouraging it.
Yeah.
I'm not saying I'm the

1387
01:31:01.710 --> 01:31:03.890
<v 3>champ.
Uh Huh.
Okay.</v>

1388
01:31:04.610 --> 01:31:07.310
<v 4>Whatever you guys,
you know,
I'll leave it up to the audience.</v>

1389
01:31:07.311 --> 01:31:09.530
You guys are the big deciders.
Let's see what we got here.

1390
01:31:09.531 --> 01:31:12.140
I haven't seen any of these.
Oh,
I'm so excited to take them.
The burp champ.

1391
01:31:12.141 --> 01:31:16.930
But if you look at the video or the playback of this podcast,
I've definitely,

1392
01:31:17.010 --> 01:31:19.040
you cheated with your liquid.
I cheat.

1393
01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:21.320
Can I have some [inaudible] the kwan please.

1394
01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:23.950
<v 11>Oh,

1395
01:31:26.730 --> 01:31:29.580
Can we get a brown tie and get a chocolate milk

1396
01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:34.320
and then go don't pike class.

1397
01:31:34.321 --> 01:31:36.270
I can probably get to Hash browns

1398
01:31:38.010 --> 01:31:42.990
and then the king man Prov by.
Can I get a number?

What's the drive of that?
Uh,
I'll do coffee.

1400
01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:51.870
Coffee of Improv.
And would you like milder hot tub?

1404
01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:08.080
Those of you that don't know that is a Seagal reference.
He um,

1405
01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:13.260
in an interview once said that he was the king of Improv.

1406
01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:17.320
If I,
if I say is,
if you don't mind me,
my saying,

1407
01:32:17.321 --> 01:32:22.321
so I believe it was something like that crazy person is totally insane thing to

1408
01:32:22.751 --> 01:32:27.280
say,
but um,

1416
01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:08.630

You know what I'm saying?
You feel me?

1456
01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:02.210
It sounds like the sound of 10 years real.

1457
01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:09.980
That's true.
It does sound

1562
01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:32.900
he facetimed us on the toilet the other day.
Yeah.

1563
01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:35.390
Yesterday we were having breakfast with little jeans.

1564
01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:39.020
And your dad was facetiming on the toilet.
Yeah.
I didn't want to look at them.

1565
01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:44.510
Yeah.
I pretended like I couldn't see him,
but you know,

01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:48.680
you could,

1568
01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:55.730
then I wanted to see at that time of my dad.

1569
01:43:56.570 --> 01:44:01.270
You've seen him shit a lot though.

No,

1571
01:44:06.110 --> 01:44:09.890
he was nice enough to,
uh,

1572
01:44:10.610 --> 01:44:14.510
he was nice enough to hang up to wipe though.
I don't know if you remember that.

1573
01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:19.100
I do remember when we were talking to your mom on their anniversary last week.

1574

Yeah.
She was looped.

1576
01:44:27.450 --> 01:44:28.283
Remember this here

1577
01:44:30.490 --> 01:44:33.100
<v 24>video in a while,
but I know make up to make it up to you.</v>

1578
01:44:33.101 --> 01:44:38.101
Because this year I've come up with something called the super and Super Burp is

1579
01:44:38.231 --> 01:44:39.460
where I saw it on a lot of air.

1580
01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:44.230
I wait till it six done more air because it makes her up instead of just barfing

1581
01:44:44.231 --> 01:44:45.190
up right up right away.

1582
01:44:45.590 --> 01:44:48.890
<v 3>So give me a little bit,
be patient.</v>

1583
01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:52.910
It's really painful to them.
So why are we watching the secret?

1584
01:44:52.911 --> 01:44:55.280
I don't know because I just fucking found it.
Oh.
Oh.

1585
01:44:55.281 --> 01:44:59.630
I thought there was a purpose.
There is a purpose to watch it.
Oh,
what do you mean

1586
01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:10.610
she's the burp champ?
It's hard to watch this part.

1587
01:45:10.611 --> 01:45:11.444
That's why

1588
01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:15.930
<v 24>I like</v>

1589
01:45:15.930 --> 01:45:20.740
<v 3>to use that for one of your promos for stand that Facebook is taking them down.</v>

1590
01:45:21.810 --> 01:45:26.680
You know,

Those assholes are taking them down.
They're making it so that,

1591
01:45:26.681 --> 01:45:29.090
uh,
justice,

You know,

1592
01:45:29.170 --> 01:45:31.720
I don't like that clip because it's like she's vomiting in the beginning.

1593
01:45:31.721 --> 01:45:34.360
I don't like that.
You think so?
I'll just like the burping part.

1594
01:45:34.361 --> 01:45:38.470
I don't like the vomity stuff.
Yeah.
I don't feel like it's that

1595
01:45:40.090 --> 01:45:44.080
you don't because you don't have a sensitivity to it.
I do.
Yeah.

1596
01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:47.410
But you shouldn't.
Yeah,
I know that it's mental problem.

1597
01:45:47.411 --> 01:45:51.280
I know that we've covered that.
You're the psychology champ already.

1598
01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:54.220
I have fucking problems with things that most people don't.

1599
01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:57.950
Can we irrational problems with things?
I know that.
Can we change it?

1600
01:45:58.590 --> 01:46:03.000
I've talked about it with my shrink a few times.
It's gotten better as it,
how so?

1601
01:46:03.530 --> 01:46:08.050
Well,
I'm a little like,
when baby jeans throws up,
I don't go into a full panic.

1602
01:46:08.130 --> 01:46:11.740
Oh yeah.
That's all I really care about is how I react around him,
you know,

1603
01:46:11.741 --> 01:46:15.880
cause I don't want him to get weird.
Yeah.
So that's gotten better.
Good.

1604
01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:19.660
So it sounds like progress.
Yeah,
but I don't,
if I don't have to see it,

1605
01:46:19.661 --> 01:46:24.100
I don't want to,
