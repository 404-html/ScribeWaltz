24
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.420
<v 2>There you go.
Um,</v>

25
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.220
that was the great British baking show recap that we did last time.
Man,

26
00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:35.210
you sound worse than me.
Why worser?
Well,

27
00:02:35.211 --> 00:02:38.180
we both have aids.
We both got aids this week.

28
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.550
Our House is covered in aids because our kid has it and then we got it.

29
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.660
Yeah.
No,
you're going to sound like this and a few days,
God,

30
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.220
I'm a few days ahead of you.
It's really fun.
I'm trying to,

31
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.000
whenever this isn't working,
so next time.

32
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.580
So our boy has had two colds in this.
One might.

33
00:02:59.581 --> 00:03:03.700
He's 15 months old and it's been too cold.
We somehow didn't get the first,

34
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.230
the second one hit and everybody's gone.
I thought I was in the clear yeah,

35
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:10.440
cause I left town.
Yeah.
And um,

36
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.540
you got it.
I got it.
The nanny got it.
We all got it now in the nannies,

37
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.500
families getting get it,
you know what I started to feel,
it's such a drag.

38
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.270
It was a,
so I did,
I did Pittsburgh,
Pittsburgh,
um,

39
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.260
new haven.
I'm sorry,
where did you haven,
Connecticut.
Yup.

40
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.160
June.
I also did a Burlington coat factory.

41
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.380
You're gonna like the way you look.
So different one.

42
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.480
But uh,
so I was fine for to everything.
Yeah.
Third.
Oh,

43
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.170
the third show of the week was the first show in Vermont.
Yeah.

44
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.950
I'm doing the meet and greet and I just start to feel Vicky.
Oh,
so you,

45
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.520
you made it to Vermont,
so you made it like a day.
Two days,
two days.

46
00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:00.820
The third day of the thing.
And then I'm like kind of,

47
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.000
I start to feel just shitty onstage,
uh,

48
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.000
for the last show and I go,
oh see,

49
00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:09.160
I didn't know if I was getting sick or just as an exhaustion.

50
00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:12.460
Sometimes you just have exhaustion,
feels the same road sick and cold,

51
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:14.470
sick in the beginning they're similar.

52
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.330
And then when I got up for the flight yesterday,
I was like,
oh,

53
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:23.800
I feel like shit right now.
You got the aids.
We both got it and I'll tell you,

54
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.910
I just canceled my whole week.
I got to recover for this weekend coming up.

55
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.800
Here's the deal with,
I have a weekend to,

56
00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:32.080
I'm in Brad this weekend so we can't fuck around.

57
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.790
The thing no one tells you with kids is that you get whatever sickness they have

58
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.700
and then there's no time to recover because you're still having to be a pure,

59
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.371
there's no day off.

60
00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:46.180
Like you just wake up sick and horrible and then you take care of this kid.

61
00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:50.050
So you've really got to take care of downtime when you can to recover.

62
00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:52.690
Otherwise you're just going to roll into another sickness pre,

63
00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:55.240
pre real pretty real.
But we're here,

64
00:04:55.241 --> 00:05:00.241
we're queer and we're nonbinary and Holly and we're going to make the best of

65
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.930
it.
Chinese,
British mouth.

66
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:09.700
Mary Berry,
Cheng likes to fuck my aunt.
That's a long title,

67
00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:13.810
but thank you Andre.
I,
where did the Chinese eyes part come from?

68
00:05:13.811 --> 00:05:17.890
I don't remember saying that about my impression.
Oh yeah,
cause you I like,

69
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.690
<v 3>oh 40 fall to fall.</v>

70
00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.250
<v 2>I think that's not,
no,
I didn't go</v>

71
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.320
<v 3>Chinese accent and Chinese eyes.
Well then show me how it's done,</v>

72
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.050
<v 2>right.
British accent.
Chinese eyes,
British accent.
Show me how you doing?</v>

73
00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.770
I guess I was going like,
yes,
you can't quite put your finger on.

74
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.520
Yeah,
like that now I,

75
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.670
I fell asleep last night during the great British baking show.

76
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.740
Season three we're about,
how far are we now?
Episode six.
We're getting in there.

77
00:05:52.741 --> 00:05:57.650
Yeah,
we're down to the final six now.
What happened on that final cut?
No.

78
00:05:57.651 --> 00:06:00.380
Tell me who they were.
Who did you see get cut last?
I didn't,

79
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.910
I fucking spaced out.

80
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.760
I thought you watched one with me and we started another one,
but I forget.

81
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.830
Oh [inaudible] are you [inaudible] go Ukrainia I was rooting for acne.

82
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.670
I liked her blue eyeshadow.
Spoiler alert.

83
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.030
Alan got the ax.
Alvin is white guy.
No,
no.

84
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.890
Well,
you know his bags were very imprecise.
He had timing issues.

85
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.310
That's what I was his undoing.
Yeah.
Is that he uh,
yeah,
he missed time to come.

86
00:06:29.311 --> 00:06:31.640
You have more things,
you know,
and here's the thing,
you know,

87
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:35.570
except for the middle challenge.
Yeah.
You've got time.

88
00:06:35.571 --> 00:06:38.120
You have a whole week to prepare your banks,

89
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.540
your signature bake and the show stopper even an entire week to prepare.

90
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.170
So there's no excuse for you to not be to time.

91
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.160
You should be practicing at home all fucking week.
Dude.
Sounds like discipline.

92
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.310
Serious flood been on reality shows.
Guys,
I know how this goes.

93
00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:54.940
I know how this works.
When the great British baking show,

94
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.140
you sound like a five year old smoker.
It's kind of fun.

95
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.070
I think I would be the worst contestant I am.

96
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.990
I have no patience for baking because that involves precision measuring
patients.

97
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.550
I have none of those things.
You would be great though.
The irony is,

98
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.690
is that you're a better cook you or better.

99
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.870
You're a better baker.
You're better at that kind of stuff than me.

100
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:27.920
I have no patience.
I don't think that's entirely,
you made,

101
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.820
remember the the time we gained 50 pounds eating pecan pies.

102
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.700
Who was making those?
Yeah,

103
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.120
I was the real thing that I missed that I used to make as chocolate souffle.

104
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.300
Those were outstanding,
but they're not good for you either.

105
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:45.170
They're not know what's wrong with them.

106
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.190
They have a little bit of sugar.
God,

107
00:07:49.191 --> 00:07:51.050
I can't even guess how many grams.

108
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.650
Do you know how we used to eat treats like that?
Every night.

109
00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.710
Every night we would make souffle's awesome.
Let's make brownies.
Okay,

110
00:08:00.711 --> 00:08:03.720
let's do cookies.
Yeah,
and it wouldn't be to have a bite either.

111
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.670
Like let's try and remember,
you and I,

112
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:12.290
we both have this thing where we like it.
Piping hot.
Any treat has to be hot,
hot,

113
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.810
hot,
hot.
I hate it when you go.

114
00:08:14.811 --> 00:08:18.410
Like I remember I went to a friend's house and she made la lime lemon bars and I

115
00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:21.800
fucking hate lemon bars to begin with and she was like,

116
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.300
let's wait for them to cool.

117
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.450
Never enjoy a cold treat.
The treat has to be warm.
If it's out of the oven,

118
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.330
it should be burning your mouth.
And that's how you know what's good.
Let's,
uh,

119
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.450
let's open this show up and we'll get back into it.
All right,

120
00:08:35.451 --> 00:08:38.780
let's do the show cause soggy bottom.

121
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:43.950
<v 4>Tonight I'm going to answer your questions about the feces fail.</v>

122
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:49.380
Now the face spell is traditionally a spill that you can do on a person to get

123
00:08:51.301 --> 00:08:54.030
rid of them out of your life.

124
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:55.653
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

125
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.010
<v 1>How old is Randy?</v>

126
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.720
Well,
we'll go to your mom's house,

127
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.000
Christina.
It's interesting.

128
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.680
Probably way too loud.

129
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:54.340
<v 5>If you're wondering this lady here,
she can see that she is,
uh,</v>

130
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:59.090
from a,
a build the black,
which coven?
The coven carbon.

131
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.050
Uh,
their,
their Facebook group description.

132
00:10:02.051 --> 00:10:06.180
It says the Blackwood coven is an online international group of eclectic
witches,

133
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:09.870
Gypsies,
warlocks and Oculus,
I call it.
Sorry.

134
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.330
Oh yeah,
you're right.
I'm sick.
Led by black,

135
00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:16.164
which s

136
00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:17.493
<v 6>before.</v>

137
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.500
<v 5>So you can tell there's a whole group of people out there,

138
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:27.370
<v 6>listen to me,
you piece of box,

I'm not bisexual too.</v>

139
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.710
I'm not gay.
Three.
No,
I'm not God damn fat.
I'm skinny as hell.

140
00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:36.270
And I'm fucking Wiccan.
Do you have a problem?
You can go fuck yourself.

141
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:37.613
Piece of shit.

142
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:43.440
<v 2>Somebody say,
remember that everybody,
there's a Wiccan was a fat fucking retard.</v>

143
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.670
That guy got really mad.
It's funny cause on.
That's deep bro.

144
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.210
I had a woman email me saying that she was awakened and she lives in this

145
00:10:51.211 --> 00:10:55.950
conservative town and she asked me whether or not she should be out and proud as

146
00:10:55.951 --> 00:11:00.870
a witch.
Yeah.
And I said absolutely not.
Yeah.
The out of your fucking mind.
Yeah.

147
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.570
There,
you know,
not,
not everything needs to be out and proud.

148
00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:07.020
There's keep that shit to yourself a lot.
You should keep to yourself.
Oh,

149
00:11:07.021 --> 00:11:09.750
lots of things that this generation's obsessed.

150
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.050
Everything has to be accepted and out and proud.
No,
you don't.

151
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.660
Some things you just,
it's not that you should be ashamed,

152
00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:18.870
but just anybody value privacy.
Keep it to fucking self.

153
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.710
I don't want to fucking tell everybody everything about me.
I don't either.

154
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.090
So weird that people were like,

155
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:28.980
and my greatest thrill was sharing everything about me with the world.
Why?

156
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.750
I don't even share my kids' pictures online.
No,
I know,
you know,

157
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.270
but I share other things on this CBRE obviously.
Yeah,
I share this stuff.

158
00:11:36.271 --> 00:11:40.800
I choose to share but not every fucking detail.
Yeah,
they got a fart.
Well,

159
00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:43.320
I don't know.
It kind of dicey right now.
Why?

160
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.960
Why are your bowel movements so di Dicey today?

161
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:50.010
<v 5>Um,
you know when you get sick you just feel different.</v>

162
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:54.280
I think it affects everything and the eating takes usually a bit of a dip or a

163
00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:55.114
change.

164
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.930
<v 2>I barely ate this week.
All I feel like eating is melted cheese on a plate.
Yeah.</v>

165
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.330
I just been eaten there.
I feel like I don't know what I want to eat.
Yeah,

166
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.410
that's the thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know.

167
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:11.260
Learning tastes get when we have a cold and I think kinda tastes like shit,

168
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.500
you know what I want to eat is melted cheese on the plate.

169
00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:18.100
It's crackers and then chocolate chip cookies like,
doesn't that sound good?

170
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:18.963
That sounds good.

171
00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:24.410
What do you miss the most of sugar of sugar if so much of it.

172
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:28.150
He said Waffles last time,
but I feel like it's different when you're sick.

173
00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.730
<v 5>Yeah,
I would like just warm pastry kind of stuff.</v>

174
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.180
Um,
Chucky croissants.

175
00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:40.220
Shopkeepers or maybe a Kinda know I want like,

176
00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:45.950
I just won't warm doughy stuff.
Sugar.

177
00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:51.390
Yeah.
Sugar.
Pastries.
Yeah.

178
00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:54.490
<v 2>So,
uh,
so last time I went past it passes.</v>

179
00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.780
That's all you can eat when you're sick.
Really should be eating carbs.

180
00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.150
So the Filipino guy got kicked off.
Was He devastated?

181
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:01.300
<v 5>He was,
um,</v>

182
00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:06.340
he knew it was coming I think because he had three basically he had one really

183
00:13:06.531 --> 00:13:10.400
bad showing first one,
second to last in the middle.

184
00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.460
And then when the third thing he,
he,
they were like,

185
00:13:13.461 --> 00:13:17.630
you have to just crush it on this one.
The,
the um,
the show stopper.
Yeah.
And He,

186
00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:19.460
uh,
he missed time then under.
Yeah.

187
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:22.920
<v 2>Yeah.
But see,
there's no excuse on the technical,
I'm sorry.
On the show stopper.</v>

188
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:26.580
The technical challenge.
Dickies throat.
They're throwing you curve balls.

189
00:13:26.581 --> 00:13:30.870
You have to rely on your knowledge of baking.
Yeah.
But the show stopper,

190
00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.810
and you should have that one down.
When you come into the ring,

191
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.210
there's no excuse to have a Porsche fucking,
yeah.

192
00:13:36.211 --> 00:13:40.890
You gotta bring it stopped the show.
And there's no soggy modems.
No.
Nope.

193
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:44.560
<v 5>It did really break shit down.
Like looking at it and he's like,</v>

194
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:48.960
this is a good finish at the bottom.
Like really inspecting it.

195
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.620
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't,
I feel like Paul Hollywood doesn't really fit into that cast.</v>

196
00:13:53.621 --> 00:13:58.150
Like he looks like a douchebag.
He's got the jelled hair,
he's got the Douchebag,

197
00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.060
goatee,
the douchebag uniform,

198
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:06.090
like the light denim and then like the colorful button down shirt and like

199
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:11.260
douchey shoes.
Like he doesn't fit in to the great British baking show.
Well,

200
00:14:11.261 --> 00:14:14.410
I think he's supposed to not fit in other words.
Right.

201
00:14:14.411 --> 00:14:18.470
It's made up of the every man,
right.
That people are just,
they're amateur.
Right.

202
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.070
The total Lesbos,
the one lazboy hosts,

203
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:25.880
and then like the more hetero appearing,
I don't want to say it's Pronoun.

204
00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:29.730
You really are.
You're being very,
very insensitive.
Yeah.

205
00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:35.620
<v 5>He is the celebrity chef on the show,
so he's,</v>

206
00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:39.460
he's supposed to be like,
I'm not like you.
I'm different than you.
I'm above you.

207
00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:42.910
Right.
I think that's what comes across.
You would be great at that,

208
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.720
at being above you.
Yeah.
No.
You know what's funny?
I was thinking about this.
Yeah,

209
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:49.320
you say that I'm the elitist.
You know you're like it,

210
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.590
but I was really thinking about it.
You're far more

211
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.720
<v 2>of an elitist.
You know why you think every place that isn't here is dog shit.</v>

212
00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.840
You're like,
give us not California except place.

213
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.460
People don't know that about you,

214
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:06.730
but you really shit on places and that's a way more elitist than you call me for

215
00:15:08.121 --> 00:15:12.590
liking a nice things.
You know?
You're like,
oh,
that's a nice Tamia like it.

216
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:17.270
But you're like,
what?
Garbage dump outside of California.

217
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.840
I call it everywhere outside of La is just not la.

218
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.920
Like I don't want to know the name of the place.
I don't want you to lead.

219
00:15:23.921 --> 00:15:28.400
It's not la.
You're such an elitist.
Well,
let me explain.
First of all,

220
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.130
La is the best.
Okay?
We have the best climate.

221
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.950
We had the best looking people and we have the best produce,

222
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:39.260
the best Mexican food.
That's true.
We have lawyers,
we have the Lakers,

223
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:43.730
bro,
bro.
We got to in all nationalities,
everybody fucking lives here.

224
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.430
You've got two new football teams to new football teams.

225
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.640
What's not to love the ocean mountains.

226
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:53.750
I can go snowboard in the morning and then go surf in the afternoon.

227
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:57.260
It's amaze.
What is amaze and what is amazing,

228
00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.930
what's not amazing about La might say.

229
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.650
Do you think that any of that makes you not an elitist now?

230
00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:07.720
It makes me a loyalist.
I would say.
Wow.
Semantics Ron.

231
00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.290
I know if it,
doesn't everybody feel that way about their home?

232
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.000
A lot of people do.
A lot of people are just like,
you know,
Toledo is the best.

233
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.630
Yeah.
They love in Akron.

234
00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.990
I probably be like fuck everywhere else besides not Akron,

235
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.740
but I'm really an Angeleno but that's cause I'm ride or die.

236
00:16:24.741 --> 00:16:29.330
Like I grew up here since I was four.
This is my home.
This is my fucking,

237
00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:33.320
he went eight till I die,
Bro.
Yeah,
yeah.

238
00:16:33.321 --> 00:16:37.400
But I called you was it?
And I go,
it's snowing and you go,

239
00:16:37.401 --> 00:16:39.110
why do you go to these awful places?

240
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:46.880
Snow to me is inexcusable.
Like I can't even fathom living in it.

241
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:51.440
I hate going to it.
Nothing makes me sadder than snow.

242
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.750
Snow in April when you're in some poor city.
And you're just like,
well,

243
00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:59.300
these poor people have to live indoors for just five months.
Right.

244
00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.750
Since then,
since October,
they've been in indoor since October.

245
00:17:02.751 --> 00:17:05.930
It's fucking April.
Let the people outside,
let them have son.

246
00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:10.190
That's what I feel like.
I feel bad for them.
I feel fucking and I'm like,

247
00:17:10.191 --> 00:17:13.880
I can't do it.
You gave me the fuck Outta here.
I mean,

248
00:17:13.881 --> 00:17:17.390
my father had that same feeling in Canada.
He was like,
oh,

249
00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:20.870
this fucking called it snow.
This.

250
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:25.640
Yeah,
this is the best then fuck it.
Fuck it dude.

251
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:29.260
I don't want to like wear coats and be unhappy and all that.

252
00:17:29.261 --> 00:17:33.200
Kind of like the seasons.
Actually.
I really do.
I do.

253
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:37.820
I like the seas of fucking throw up,
right?
I do.
What about it?

254
00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.670
I don't even know you.
I'm serious.
I'm so upset right now.
I like fall.

255
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:47.560
I love you don't get a real proper one here.
It's,

256
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.880
it gets down to 60 I got to put it like a sweater on.
No,

257
00:17:50.881 --> 00:17:54.900
because the hottest ones here are our autumn.
Sure feared a little bit.

258
00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:58.330
That's September,
October,
actually hotter than July and October.

259
00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.810
It's like the hottest month.
Yeah.

260
00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:04.900
So then November becomes basically autumn.

261
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.940
Yeah.
You know it's perfect.
November,
December and then

262
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:15.130
yes,
as you don't really get a proper one Christmas,
it dips down into 70 yeah.

263
00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:18.330
Christmas morning for this Chili got to turn that heater on.

264
00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:23.010
The nighttime can get down to 46 degrees c but I like the,

265
00:18:23.011 --> 00:18:27.000
I'm saying those days are like basically what a normal autumn feels like.

266
00:18:27.001 --> 00:18:29.560
I liked those days a lot.
I like on them days.
Yeah.

267
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.870
Now you got upset this this year because of the rain.
Fuck.

268
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.940
You hated it and it got very mad.
See,

269
00:18:35.941 --> 00:18:39.720
you don't like whether you say you do and then when you live in it,

270
00:18:39.721 --> 00:18:41.360
it's mostly around though we misery.

271
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:46.400
We had three months of basically nonstop downpour.

272
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:50.160
I know.
Remember when you want it to live in Seattle for a minute,
you will like,

273
00:18:50.161 --> 00:18:52.770
let's move to Seattle or Portland and I was like,
Bro,

274
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.650
you don't know what you're saying.
Not Rain is real.

275
00:18:55.740 --> 00:19:00.090
I still want to move to Colorado.
I love Colorado.
It's not la though.

276
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:02.460
I know.
That'll be it.
That'll be the whole thing.

277
00:19:02.461 --> 00:19:05.670
That'll happen if we moved anywhere.
What's the problem is that it's not here.

278
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.180
Here's going to be the problem.
There's no proper Mexican food in Denver,

279
00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:13.580
and I know we're going to get emails and no Mexicans that lived,

280
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.520
not like La Mexicans.
Well,
yeah,
I know,
but there's still Mexican.

281
00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.710
They left Mexico.
It's not the same.

282
00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:23.340
Don't they always make the food to go with the tastes of the locals?

283
00:19:23.341 --> 00:19:23.821
For instance,

284
00:19:23.821 --> 00:19:28.080
I was in Kansas City once and I saw there was a Mexican dude in the kitchen and

285
00:19:28.081 --> 00:19:30.420
I go,
Bro,
don't give me this fucking dog shit on the menu.

286
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.100
You give me what you're having for lunch.

287
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:35.910
Give me what the busboys and you guys are eating.
And he made me Mexican food,

288
00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:37.230
but it was diluted.

289
00:19:37.231 --> 00:19:40.740
It was like double down because all the honkies are eating it.

290
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:41.830
You know what I'm saying?
Okay.

291
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.570
They still give you like the white man version that bothers you.
Yeah,

292
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:50.010
we're right on the border,
Bro.
We're right near Mexico.
We're right there.
Okay.

293
00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:54.590
Okay.
Uh,

294
00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:59.300
do you feel this way for like Bill Milwaukee or a Florida?
No,

295
00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.713
<v 7>no.</v>

296
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.480
<v 2>I love La.
I love living in La.
What's your favorite place to live so far?
You Oh,</v>

297
00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:08.940
here?
Yeah,
for sure.
Yeah,
absolutely the longest.
I mean,
I like it here,

298
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.820
but I do like Tattoo Bro.
La.

299
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:15.570
I do like other cities too that you don't like any other?
No,
I'm just kidding.

300
00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:18.780
I here's the cities I like.
Let's be real,
real talk.

301
00:20:18.781 --> 00:20:21.900
I'm going to upset a lot of people.
The big ones.

302
00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:26.820
Leighton name a big one.
They're all good in America.
Yeah.
I like Miami.

303
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:30.990
Miami's like La Times a hundred.
It's ridiculous,
right?
Yeah.

304
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.460
I like New York.
Obviously.
Seattle,
Portland,
Austin.

305
00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:37.120
<v 7>Okay.</v>

306
00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.650
<v 2>Minneapolis.
Tits is great.
All the biggers.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sanford,</v>

307
00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:46.000
Sanford and friend to I lived in San Francisco.
Love it.
Yeah.
San Diego,

308
00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.460
Sacramento,
San Jose.

309
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.220
<v 5>Those are all good places to California cities.</v>

310
00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:57.320
I like mom.
[inaudible] I like all these places.
This is my favorite.
Yeah,

311
00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:01.180
I just don't think I could live.
I would cause I'd be very like,
what would,

312
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.470
what would we live in there?

313
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:06.340
You just get used to living in this climate all the time.

314
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.970
It really is a weather thing too.
And like a lifestyle.

315
00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:11.220
I don't mind sitting in my car for an hour.

316
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:16.450
I want you to really pay attention to the weather.
That's a good month.

317
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:20.080
That's a really good,
here's my problem with Denver.
Snow's and it gets cold.

318
00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.140
It doesn't get that cold.
Sure does for me.
Yeah.

319
00:21:23.141 --> 00:21:25.300
But it doesn't get like Chicago cold.

320
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:29.190
That's that cold is real.

321
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.260
I don't know how people strive.
Brutal.
Brutal.
Cold.

322
00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:37.320
Where's the coldest in America?
Uh,
it's constantly North Dakota.
Oof.

323
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.153
Minneapolis,

324
00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:45.010
Minnesota like is actually colder and God damn those poor people.

325
00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.580
You just get used to it.
Is that what it is?
Yeah,
absolutely.
You got used to it.

326
00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:50.770
How long would you think it would take me?

327
00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:55.480
Someone who is like almost born and bred in la.
Yeah,

328
00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:59.860
I five years.
I mean,

329
00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:03.880
the second time it came around you'd be like,
Oh fuck this again,
third,
fourth,

330
00:22:03.881 --> 00:22:06.430
fifth time.
And you'd just be like,
yeah,
this is how it is.

331
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:10.630
Because some of those fools go out and like a thin jacket dude.
Like I come,

332
00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:14.960
I come rock in a Parka spaces.
Is that real?
I'm serious.
Yeah,

333
00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:18.310
because you're,
I was walking around,
uh,

334
00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:22.000
Burlington and the coat factory,
the coke factory,

335
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:26.380
and it was a,
I don't know,
it was a cool day,

336
00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:30.370
but for me like I wanted a hat and a jacket and everything cause I'm not used to

337
00:22:30.371 --> 00:22:33.220
it.
And I saw,
you know,

338
00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:37.360
college kids walking around and tee shirts because,

339
00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.360
because comparison to what they were coming out of their winner,

340
00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:44.860
this was a much warmer day.
That's how I used to be tourist.

341
00:22:44.861 --> 00:22:48.610
When you see them in La and then they're there in the water and our ocean and

342
00:22:48.611 --> 00:22:51.060
February and you're like,
that's a Canadian because I should,

343
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:53.830
does not phase them but an Angeleno it'd be like hell no,

344
00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.740
let's wait until August before anybody goes in there.
No,
it's a,

345
00:22:56.741 --> 00:23:01.510
it's very much you get,
you adapt,
your body adapts.
When I moved to Florida,

346
00:23:01.511 --> 00:23:06.340
I moved in November and I had been living in Cincinnati,

347
00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:07.870
Minneapolis in Milwaukee.

348
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:12.040
I moved in November to Florida in Florida in November where I lived,

349
00:23:12.041 --> 00:23:14.290
it was probably like 50 something.

350
00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:20.370
They were all in sweatshirts and jackets and I was in a t shirt like sweating.

351
00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:25.030
People thought I was mentally ill.
What is wrong with you,
man?

352
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:28.090
It's like I just moved from somewhere where it's fucking five degrees outside,

353
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:31.750
so 55 it's fucking awesome.
Yeah,

354
00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:36.130
but some of the next year,
but I had a sweatshirt on.
Oh yeah,
get used to.

355
00:23:36.131 --> 00:23:39.880
It used to be hot all the time.
Yeah.
You're not used to being warm enough.

356
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:42.530
You still are like it's hot.

357
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.130
Yeah,
but you

358
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:50.170
<v 2>always insist on it being freezing cold and our bedroom and the office.</v>

359
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:52.310
You have to get you.
Here's the thing,

360
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.120
you have to let la like the heat just get in you bro.

361
00:23:56.121 --> 00:24:00.110
You gotta like it's 15 but you got to live in a nice,

362
00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.320
let yourself be warm.
Do you let your son,

363
00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:07.420
<v 4>many of the spells that you can do just to get somebody away for her tits are</v>

364
00:24:08.151 --> 00:24:09.700
going to fall right out of that address.

365
00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.400
The next level causing harm.

366
00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.290
Before you do this,
you're susy Su,
very god,

367
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:24.680
before you put in the effort to actually do this master of accident.

368
00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:28.190
<v 2>Where is she?
Has this New Zealand or is this Australia?
No,</v>

369
00:24:28.191 --> 00:24:30.850
but can I ask you about eyeshadow?
Yeah.

370
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:34.700
Is it normally the eyelid and then the whole eye area?

371
00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.460
Only if you're a 15 and goth.
But like normally what do you know?
When I was golf,

372
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:41.960
this is how you're,
this is how Susie,
Susie,
Susie,

373
00:24:41.961 --> 00:24:44.930
the banshees did her and that's how we did it.
And what do you do now?

374
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:49.430
Look at what I do now.
Natural.
But you do the whole area though.

375
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:55.040
You're not supposed to put eye shadow from the bottom of your lid up to your

376
00:24:55.041 --> 00:24:59.210
eyebrow.
And then around the eye it looks crazy.
Eye socket like no dude,

377
00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:02.180
that's like the woman,
first of all,
that's how I know the bitch is crazy.

378
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:07.160
Number two,
when the bitch draws the lip liner around the lip,

379
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:08.023
if you know bitch,

380
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:13.270
that draws the lip liner up over the line in the mouth and then she fills it in

381
00:25:13.641 --> 00:25:16.640
like that's her lip,
please bitch,
please.

382
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:19.790
<v 4>The feces.
So she does that too.</v>

383
00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:28.670
Insane that the feces spells to do is quite simple.

384
00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:32.810
The idea is to get some toy,
I use the fucking shit.

385
00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:38.770
What you do is you write the name of that person on the paper and then what

386
00:25:39.321 --> 00:25:41.050
you're really doing is going in there,

387
00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:45.320
you taking a shit on the paper and you're flushing them out of your life.

388
00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:49.850
<v 2>Wow.
I think that's uh,
actually just something you should probably do.</v>

389
00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.610
That's a,
it seems every day.
Well,
every day.

390
00:25:52.611 --> 00:25:54.470
But it also seems like that makes a lot of sense.

391
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:59.500
Maybe just the mental process of doing that feels probably very cleansing.

392
00:26:00.621 --> 00:26:03.920
No anything.
Yeah.
It's very cathartic.
It's also,
um,

393
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:08.780
a colossal waste of time.
No hostile guy.
No.
I said,
sorry.
A colossal,

394
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.970
a colossal waste of your energy,
isn't it?
Probably to really hate that person.

395
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.770
How about just forget it.
Let it go.

396
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:19.850
Good therapist and go take a shit on this paper.
Flush them

397
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:25.120
<v 4>Jane Lane or a beginner beginner maybe takes us three months to do.</v>

398
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:30.420
Oh my God.
Wow.
Every day.
Many people like to hear,

399
00:26:30.421 --> 00:26:32.040
but that's a reality.
All of it

400
00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:38.460
a long time to get into state and to focus and actually believe.

401
00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:42.030
So hang in there.
Be patient,

402
00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:44.040
but remember this

403
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:49.100
<v 3>is a spell to cause harm to someone you really don't like.</v>

404
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:51.810
So use it with caution.

405
00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:56.340
Now I know they're are going to spill out of her mushers or throw.

406
00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:56.911
The bat is hanging.

407
00:26:56.911 --> 00:27:01.740
He's mine now as somebody that was golf in high school and I read a lot about

408
00:27:01.741 --> 00:27:06.450
witchcraft and all this stuff.
You're not supposed to do black magic.
Why not?

409
00:27:06.451 --> 00:27:10.890
Because it's rooted in bad and it's just going to come back and get you.

410
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:13.650
Everybody knows that he shit on the paper.

411
00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:22.950
Everybody knows.
Everybody knows you're I supposed to do that.
Bad Karma dip shit.

412
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:28.620
Big asshole.
Stupid,
Huh?
Yup.

413
00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:37.110
Would you do a spell?
I would do it.
A fart spell.
I would do that shit.

414
00:27:37.111 --> 00:27:41.070
Spell the feces spell.
I don't see why not.
Why does our car smelled bad?

415
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:46.260
We talk about that.
That was,
you know,
it happened to both vehicles.

416
00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.640
Yours and mine had stinky air conditioners.

417
00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.570
I don't know.
It was really upsetting.
Well,

418
00:27:55.020 --> 00:28:00.020
but what causes that smell like bong smelled real,

419
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.070
real bad.
Real bunk

420
00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:06.950
for turn on the car and it was like the car was

421
00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:16.680
good,
like a car,
you Naz Jihad.

422
00:28:16.681 --> 00:28:17.910
I took mine in and they go,

423
00:28:17.911 --> 00:28:21.720
well you know Rodens borough in the engines,

424
00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:23.461
you know,

425
00:28:23.461 --> 00:28:26.580
maybe we'll find a decompose and that's what you're smelling them through your,

426
00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:31.050
I was like,
ah,
file dog.
And then,

427
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:36.000
uh,
he checked mine out and was like,
no,
it wasn't there.

428
00:28:36.001 --> 00:28:40.100
It just smells like farts.
And he's like,
we just cleaned everything,

429
00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:42.480
change the filter smell better.

430
00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:47.350
Or your air conditioner just started smelling like Fart song.
Yeah.

431
00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:50.700
Do you think it's from your farts in the car?
I didn't ask,

432
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.400
but it didn't seem like that would make sense.

433
00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:58.290
Like a forensic autopsy or whatever on the car and the,

434
00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:04.130
I don't know.
I don't know.
Um,
but then yours started to see,

435
00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:09.100
you're starting to smell later.
Maybe all your parts built up in there.
You,

436
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:14.040
I thought it might be because I,
sometimes I make like a cucumber apple,

437
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:18.000
like blended shake things and I leave it in there.
They mentioned that.

438
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:18.780
Actually no,

439
00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:23.640
they really did because when I picked yours up they kept it for three days to do

440
00:29:23.641 --> 00:29:28.290
this.
Um,
he's like,
I think the smell is pretty much taken care of,

441
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:32.700
but there's like a juice thing in there and got my smell now cause it's just

442
00:29:32.701 --> 00:29:35.250
been left in there.
Anyway.
Thanks for leaving it guys.

443
00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:39.030
You think I wanted to save that?
Yeah.
Thank you.
That's very courteous.

444
00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:41.630
Did you leave the empty yet?
70 in there

445
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.370
<v 2>to collapse everything.
Thanks guys.</v>

446
00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:47.980
Leave it exactly as I gave it to you.

447
00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:54.430
Pretty cool.
I need it exact.
Yeah.

448
00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:59.710
Well I'm curious so they don't have any theories other than a dead rodent.
Yeah,

449
00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:03.280
he's like are,
you know like the filters could just be filthy,

450
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:07.050
but that's what it is.
The air filter.
It didn't make that much sense though.

451
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:12.070
God change the air filter.
Get Old.
Huh?
Who's that?

452
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:16.120
That's the guy that told you.
Okay.
Yeah,
they were terrible.

453
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:19.600
It was terrible at your yours,
the car service.
Yeah,

454
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:21.490
they kept the car for fucking three days,
Bro.

455
00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:26.200
<v 5>I basically had the fuckers routine service and I was like,
oh,</v>

456
00:30:26.201 --> 00:30:28.240
also when you check out the air conditioning,
it smells,

457
00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:32.320
how long will this tag is?
Like 60,
90 minutes.
And I was like,
yeah,
I'll go home.

458
00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:37.860
Just call me.
He's like,
oh,
we need to keep it overnight.
And I go,
oh please,

459
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:43.070
you went from 60 minutes to 90 minutes to overnight and that sounds really good.

460
00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:47.110
And I know we all have a mute button.
Yeah,

461
00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:50.560
well we do actually a cough button on like there's a I can,

462
00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:54.640
I can take care of you.
There you go.
Now no one hears.
Well,

463
00:30:55.450 --> 00:31:00.440
somewhat muted.
You done,
you're finished.

464
00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:04.480
You're finished.
You're done.
Um,
and then he called me the second day.

465
00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.630
<v 2>Yeah,
we need to give her the again.
I'm like,</v>

466
00:31:06.631 --> 00:31:10.000
what are you fucking doing to this thing man?
Oh the road is

467
00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:15.300
so lame.
Stupid.
Fart.

468
00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:17.550
Take off the whole dashboard.

469
00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:23.850
We know every car I've owned eventually smells funky though.

470
00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:26.730
I had a Volkswagen Jetta.
Remember that one?

471
00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:29.940
And that one smelled like crayons for years.
Yeah,
no,

472
00:31:29.941 --> 00:31:31.830
I blame it on an accident I got into,

473
00:31:31.831 --> 00:31:36.831
I got rear ended and the trunk was jammed open and it rained in the trunk and I

474
00:31:38.011 --> 00:31:42.130
think it got moldy and the smart,
it smelled of crayons for years.

475
00:31:42.131 --> 00:31:45.840
That's possible.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Before that,
my Chevy Nova,

476
00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:50.490
I just smoked cigarettes and they're in the ashtray.
Gnarly.
I know.

477
00:31:50.491 --> 00:31:52.320
Isn't that crazy?
Now to think about that.

478
00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:57.260
Whenever I see anyone smoking in their car.
Roseola Lailey yeah.

479
00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:01.680
Hard fucking core.
Right?
Especially when you see really nice cars.
Yeah.

480
00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.230
I was just at a red light.

481
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:07.410
I see this brand new Lexus next to me and you see the window cracked this much

482
00:32:07.411 --> 00:32:11.920
and the person just smoking.
I'm like,
you're smoking in the nasty brand.

483
00:32:11.921 --> 00:32:15.210
Beautiful,
beautiful car.
I know.
No regard.
I mean,

484
00:32:15.211 --> 00:32:19.980
the worst obviously is windows up.
Like you have to be on real lunatic.

485
00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:24.390
Just sit in that dude.
And people did,
I mean back in the nineties eighties dude,

486
00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:28.310
you'd see that Ah,
this nasty fucking nasty.

487
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:29.263
<v 8>And this again,</v>

488
00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:34.690
it's Timmy Hill 2.0 prior job to hear speed up here.

489
00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:38.300
This is a sanitation driver.
So you can hear me better.

490
00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:43.490
He held 2.0 going after the mattress Nacho,

491
00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:46.740
without getting out.
I looked like fun.

492
00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:51.640
<v 3>Try to grab a mattress without getting out there.
Getting out 11.</v>

493
00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:55.300
Who's driving the sanitation truck and he's using the claw basically,

494
00:32:55.301 --> 00:32:58.910
right the arm to see if he can do it.
Uh,
like basically,

495
00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:01.700
<v 8>I hope my ankle doesn't get bad,
but</v>

496
00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.080
<v 3>do it.
Did he's got it so far.
Yeah.</v>

497
00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:10.380
<v 8>Turn,
turn,
turn.
He's turning it all right.
Sweet.
And she's killing it.
Look at it.</v>

498
00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:14.800
Turn.
Okay,
let's pause here.
Oh.
Oh.
It's spending a lot.

499
00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.050
It's spending a lot.
He's doing it.

500
00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:18.590
<v 3>Yup.</v>

501
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:23.530
<v 8>Does it?
Ooh.
Ooh.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
We got a good grip.</v>

502
00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:30.533
<v 3>Yeah.
Hell yeah.</v>

503
00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:37.603
<v 8>Look at the other guy.</v>

504
00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:38.990
<v 3>Any other trends you guys did?</v>

505
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:40.380
<v 8>I'm so cool.</v>

506
00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:49.130
<v 3>Yup.
Good for him.
Yeah,
I bet that took years of experience.</v>

507
00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:54.740
That was a oh,
for sure.
Yeah.
You can't do that first week on the job.
Hell no,
no,

508
00:33:54.741 --> 00:33:58.530
no,
no.
Good for him.
That was funny.
Yeah.
Yeah.

509
00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:01.990
Let's do something not so funny.
Oh No.
Hello.

510
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:07.070
I'm thank you for joining us and covering your dometic 300 series RV toilet to

511
00:34:07.751 --> 00:34:11.800
operate your dometic RV toilet first.
Add water bowl.
No Shit.

512
00:34:11.801 --> 00:34:14.350
We down on the pedal watershed enter the bowl.

513
00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:18.730
But the flushing mechanism should not.
If the flushing mechanism opens,

514
00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:24.060
release pressure off the pedal until water only water in the bowl prevents odors

515
00:34:25.481 --> 00:34:30.040
from entering the RV and it may be necessary to have water before flushing

516
00:34:30.041 --> 00:34:34.270
solids or toilet paper.
To flush your dometic toilet,

517
00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.660
press down all the way on the pedal or liquids.

518
00:34:37.661 --> 00:34:40.420
Press down for one to two seconds or solid.

519
00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:44.710
Hold the pedal down as long as necessary to remove all the contents.

520
00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:50.710
Flush mechanism open for too long.
The wool will your holding tank.

521
00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:58.840
See this is a unique boring video because it's boring and not difficult to

522
00:34:58.841 --> 00:35:01.660
understand.
Right?
So it's a whole new level of boring.

523
00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:05.170
It's boring and like boring and you process basic.
Yeah,

524
00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:09.460
it's almost,
it's almost better to boring not understand it,
right?
Yeah.

525
00:35:09.461 --> 00:35:13.130
Cause I'm challenged.
But that was like double bad.
Yeah.
That's the worst.

526
00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:15.940
And you're like,
I get it,
I get it.

527
00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:19.420
I got it.
Wait,

528
00:35:19.421 --> 00:35:23.800
so I got to hold it flush down the contents go away.

529
00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:26.400
I got it.
Fuck.

530
00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:31.120
What about the Yellow Stupa

531
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:38.070
I think those cold medicines.
Really Fun.
Did you take

532
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:41.880
<v 2>it?
No,
you gotta try it.
It's a fucking party partying right now.</v>

533
00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:46.560
Yeah,
I'm having a great time on the show.
You know what?
Speaking of toilet seat,

534
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:51.060
I went to see a movie by myself.
I saw trainspotting two fucking awesome,

535
00:35:51.061 --> 00:35:52.920
by the way.
I don't know why nobody's talking about it,

536
00:35:52.921 --> 00:35:55.380
but it's a really good movie.
It stands on its own.

537
00:35:55.381 --> 00:35:58.620
If you haven't seen the first one,
you can see the second one.
Anyways,

538
00:35:58.621 --> 00:36:01.860
I went to go potty and you know,
you know what I'm saying?

539
00:36:01.861 --> 00:36:04.710
It's like a nice theater.
I fucking pull my pants down.

540
00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:09.010
I sit down and it's wet.
Ah.

541
00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:12.480
I sat on a p covered seat.
Bare ass dude.

542
00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:18.540
Tell me all these nasty as hell.
It was so bad and it's happened before.

543
00:36:18.541 --> 00:36:21.210
You know,
that's not the first time.
I just didn't look cause I was out of it.

544
00:36:21.211 --> 00:36:24.000
And sick bed.
Put a nasty bitch.

545
00:36:24.001 --> 00:36:28.230
Just pissing on the seat like a nice theater dude.
Cause so yeah,

546
00:36:28.231 --> 00:36:30.570
we're not at fucking Angel Stadium.

547
00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:37.170
That's gross man.
If you ever done that before,
I've sat on Piss.
Yeah,

548
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.720
it's gross.
It's upsetting.

549
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:44.130
It's so upsetting because it's like stranger piss.
It's not even somebody,

550
00:36:44.131 --> 00:36:49.020
you know.
That's the worst part about it.
It's like,
who's fucking AIDS?
P is on me.

551
00:36:49.021 --> 00:36:52.500
I don't want it.
Aids p Jesus.

552
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.820
But then I started getting paranoid.
I'm like,
can I catch a disease this way?

553
00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:01.960
Like can I get asked herpes or something
from someone's urine?
No,

554
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:07.470
it's really sterile.
Actually.
Nothing bad can happen.
Oh my God,

555
00:37:07.471 --> 00:37:12.330
you guys are so disgusting.
You can't get,
you can't get sick.

556
00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:17.430
No.
Right.
No.
I mean it's just on your bud skin.
Like on your thigh skin.
It's fine.

557
00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:24.360
Nothing will happen.
Oh,
speaking of PB,

558
00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:29.730
we took Fifo and Schnitzel to the vet,
uh,
last,
uh,

559
00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:31.680
two weeks ago and Fifo.

560
00:37:31.681 --> 00:37:34.020
They took his urine and then we'd get a call three days later.

561
00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:38.010
All the urine samples not strong enough.
I go,
yeah,

562
00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:42.210
well we can't tell it as I concentrated.
You guys need to do is,
uh,

563
00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:46.410
tomorrow morning when he wakes up his first morning pee,

564
00:37:46.411 --> 00:37:50.250
you guys have to collect the first morning pee.
I go,
what?

565
00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:55.680
Okay.
I'm on it.
Yeah.
I go,
how am I supposed to do that?

566
00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:58.910
Well,
you know,
I'm a fucking dog training.

567
00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:04.230
I go,
how am I supposed to do that?
Well,
you know,

568
00:38:04.231 --> 00:38:08.040
he lifts his leg or does he spot I go,
he fucking lives his leg.
He's a real man.

569
00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:11.940
Yeah.
He's a dog not buying.
And uh,
she goes,
well,

570
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:13.960
what you can do,
you can,

571
00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:21.030
you can get like a Tupperware container and just put it under there when he

572
00:38:21.031 --> 00:38:24.750
lifts his leg in the morning.
I okay.
Yeah.
I acted like,

573
00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:31.350
I mean,
who the fuck is going to do that?
As much as I love Fif I know.

574
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:34.440
How am I going to even do this?
No,
it's fucking crazy.

575
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.430
If I'm going to fuck my dad was somebody,

576
00:38:36.431 --> 00:38:41.350
I'm going to find out a trained professional though.
Fuck my dog.
Wet.
Yeah.
I mean,

577
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:46.270
our dog by the way.
I Dunno.
I have some dogs I could see getting away with that.

578
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.090
Our dog,
as soon as you reach down there,
he'd be like,
excuse me,

579
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:53.420
what are you doing?
And he would hold his pee for eight more hours.
Yeah.

580
00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.470
He's not the type of dog that just because I was like,
oh,
okay.

581
00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.800
Fiefs not easy going,
you know,
and he's,
he's on the ball.

582
00:38:59.801 --> 00:39:03.820
He knows shit fuse like a person.
He's really smart.
He'll be like,

583
00:39:03.821 --> 00:39:08.260
get the fuck away from me with that shit.
I don't care.
You can dog assholes.

584
00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:11.530
So we're not,

585
00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:15.220
we're not going to know if fiefs kidneys are functioning well because I'm not

586
00:39:15.221 --> 00:39:20.170
going to do that.
Yeah.
Oh.
And then they go,
he has a slight heart murmur.

587
00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:24.580
Here's the,
uh,
here's the heart specialist.
You can take him to.

588
00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:31.120
Hey,
what's so funny about that yet?
I mean,
I love my dog,

589
00:39:31.121 --> 00:39:34.510
but a heart specialist for the fucking dog.
Seriously.

590
00:39:34.511 --> 00:39:36.520
What are we going to give him a heart transplant?
Nope.

591
00:39:36.521 --> 00:39:41.521
Open her dog surgery to see how to what extent the heart is,

592
00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:46.330
uh,
having a murmur so that when you put them under for a mouth cleaning,

593
00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.531
that he's right.

594
00:39:47.531 --> 00:39:51.040
He didn't know that the heart specialist will tell you this is the safe range

595
00:39:51.041 --> 00:39:52.990
for anesthesia.
Oh,
that's why.
Oh,

596
00:39:52.991 --> 00:39:57.110
I thought she wanted us to give him open heart surgery or find a donor.
No.

597
00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:01.270
Give him an Oregon transplant.
Why?
Why am I,
oh,
because I love fucking dogs.

598
00:40:01.271 --> 00:40:02.470
I'm just going to take the dog.

599
00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:07.000
<v 3>Yeah,
come on.
You have to understand that</v>

600
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:12.260
<v 2>linkedin is helpful.
You have to understand that you get that right.</v>

601
00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.220
The about the anesthesia.
Yeah.
Yes.
But I,
I just,

602
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:21.020
it struck me as very ridiculous when I heard that we had to take our fucking 14

603
00:40:21.021 --> 00:40:23.990
pound dog to a cardiologist.

604
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:28.940
Now get out of here now when you get it.

605
00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:36.720
<v 3>Uh Huh.</v>

606
00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.600
<v 2>You get that a dog's going under.</v>

607
00:40:38.601 --> 00:40:43.130
He needs the to tolerate a little more DNA.
Well,

608
00:40:43.131 --> 00:40:46.280
why don't you collect his urine tomorrow morning and then I'll take him to the

609
00:40:46.281 --> 00:40:49.340
cardiologist,
stand them up.
We can call it a week.

610
00:40:49.341 --> 00:40:52.220
We can spend $5,000 on this dog's health care.

611
00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:57.230
I would spend it on FIFA.
You want to clone fif?
I do.

612
00:40:57.231 --> 00:40:59.280
I want to clone him for 25,000.

613
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.310
I love beef.
I love him too.
He's the best.
Yeah,

614
00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:08.460
but I don't know how I'm going to collect his urine like that.
That's in,

615
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:12.980
why can't we just have him bring him in again and have him take your in that

616
00:41:12.981 --> 00:41:13.480
time?

617
00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:17.500
I think what I might ask is if we can bring him in first thing in the morning.

618
00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:20.620
Like Fifa Holds His pee all day.
He hates pink all day.

619
00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:24.490
He hates going outside for any reason.
I mean,

620
00:41:24.491 --> 00:41:27.340
right now he's still asleep on the couch.
He loves it.

621
00:41:27.341 --> 00:41:29.160
He loves being under the covers and sleeping.

622
00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:34.120
He wouldn't eat or pee or shit unless we forced it on heads his life.
Yeah.

623
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:38.030
Yeah.
No,
that's true.
Bitsy,
on the other hand,
different dog.

624
00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:42.440
Totally trusting would,
let me do that in a minute.
You Want me To pee?
Where like,

625
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:47.900
<v 5>you know,
a lot of people,
we have new listeners all the time,
uh,</v>

626
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:51.650
are always trying to figure out what's the origin of the show.

627
00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:54.770
What's the show actually about?
At our core,

628
00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:58.370
we are denim specialists.

629
00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:01.940
That's what really what this show is about.
I mean,

630
00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:05.140
it's not a mistake that you're wearing that jacket in that course.

631
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:07.850
So whenever it's possible,

632
00:42:07.851 --> 00:42:12.180
we like to thoroughly dive into the denim world.

633
00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:15.540
<v 9>Oh,
so finally,
back to our tests.</v>

634
00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:20.580
First thing I would look at would be I guess a stretch.
Is it?
Um,
is it real?

635
00:42:20.581 --> 00:42:23.100
Denim isn't just stretchy cotton.

636
00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:28.290
Taylor Rebbie maternal says overall the quality of all three genes is good,

637
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:30.360
but finds the ones from target,

638
00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:34.830
which is the most expensive at $10 don't have strong sides stitching.

639
00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:40.090
<v 2>Wait,
the most expensive is $10.
What genes are they looking into?
I don't know.</v>

640
00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:40.690
Let's see.

641
00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:45.130
I didn't know you could buy jeans for $10 Daily Mail in the UK on the denim for

642
00:42:45.131 --> 00:42:48.780
a couple.
Okay.
They investigated goodness you can get $10.
Yeah.

643
00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:52.980
<v 9>The idea is the more,
the better.
So this one doesn't have any,</v>

644
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.820
this has one that one has to,

645
00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:58.750
it's the one with the double stitch of the $7 pair from Kmart.

646
00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:03.680
The Hem on those Kmart pair isn't as good as the others are going to rabbit.

647
00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:09.120
I could've told you that there this him compared to that him the quality is

648
00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:12.730
pretty noticeable from the inside and outside.

649
00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:16.110
<v 2>If you guys are real.
This is like the denim doctor.
Yeah.</v>

650
00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:20.550
I gotta tell you if you're looking for bang for your buck for quality and price,

651
00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:23.340
I think that like old school Levi's with a way to go.

652
00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:28.370
If you don't want to go designer,
you just like standard,
don't you think?
Yeah.

653
00:43:28.371 --> 00:43:29.204
Yeah.

654
00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:32.670
<v 5>Levi's are,
are are high quality.
Yeah,</v>

655
00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:34.510
<v 2>for sure.
Yeah.
For the money.
For the money.</v>

656
00:43:34.511 --> 00:43:36.010
If you're not wanting to spend like a hundred dollars

657
00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:40.370
<v 5>on,
you're a GS and your age.
These are amazing.</v>

658
00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:44.180
They are amazeballs everyone,
your friend's dad came here and we're like,

659
00:43:44.181 --> 00:43:47.750
cool dad jeans.
I forget.
You don't remember that?

660
00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.180
My friend's Dad.
Yeah.

661
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:55.590
<v 2>Oh yes.
Yeah.
He came over here.
Oh No,
look at his jeans.</v>

662
00:43:55.700 --> 00:44:00.330
Yeah,
he had like,
they were like baggy on the side.
Yeah.
And I was like,
you know,

663
00:44:00.331 --> 00:44:05.090
do you want,
we can go get some uh,
high quality ones.
I gave some nice ones.
Yeah.

664
00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:09.300
The mall.
And he's like,
what do you pay for those?
I said,
I don't know,

665
00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:12.120
like a hundred and something.
He's like,
what are you fucking out of your mind?

666
00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:16.500
Yeah.
It doesn't understand that.
Yeah.
You know,

667
00:44:16.501 --> 00:44:21.360
the genes do really make the person the good genes are everything.

668
00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:25.080
Yeah.
I'm serious.
Like now that I spend a little bit more on jeans,

669
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:29.400
Hudson's great.
Agee is great.
Yeah.
Lucky brand is great.
Yeah.

670
00:44:29.401 --> 00:44:32.850
Lucky makes good genes.
Cause when was fatter,
I got gray,
had Ellis,

671
00:44:32.851 --> 00:44:36.990
it was really important and it was buying gap jeans.
Those suck.
They're not good.

672
00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:40.180
Not For me.
I wore them for a long time.
Yeah.
They're,

673
00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:42.510
they don't fit as well as lucky for me for some reason.

674
00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:44.370
You just have to find the brand that works for you.
Right.

675
00:44:44.371 --> 00:44:47.280
So think about lucky was there,
they always had crazy sales.
Yeah.

676
00:44:47.281 --> 00:44:51.240
They did a pretty good,
we went there together.
They were like 50% off.

677
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:53.640
It was crazy.
It's not bad.
It's really good.

678
00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:56.560
<v 9>Fair jeans.
So which is the overall winner?</v>

679
00:44:56.561 --> 00:45:01.080
So genes overall finish in terms of the quality of finish?
Uh,

680
00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:05.650
regarding the Hem,
the stitching on the waistline.
The fish.
The detail.
Yeah.

681
00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:06.970
I would still go with this one.

682
00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:12.220
The just here from big w currently on sale for $7 $7

683
00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:16.920
<v 2>and here we're talking about a hundred.
I know Jesus.
But those aren't good jeans.</v>

684
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:18.680
No.
I know the stitching is bad,

685
00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:23.550
<v 9>but how did they all stand up after 10 washes?
Oh,
well this is the big w pair.</v>

686
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:27.540
You can see that there's a slight color fading and some shrinkage.
Yeah,

687
00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:31.290
the target pair of shrunk,
much more.
Whoa.
Color.

688
00:45:31.291 --> 00:45:34.860
The best came up though.
The difference is obvious.

689
00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:39.910
After 10 washes,
their color's faded slightly,
but they have clearly shrunk.

690
00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:40.763
Huh?

691
00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:44.570
<v 2>Hey,
let's track like three inches,
man.
What is that?
It's a lot.
Okay.
No,</v>

692
00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.580
I bought a lot of clothing from target.

693
00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:50.240
Some of the best shirts I've ever had in my entire life had been from target

694
00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:54.420
black standards.
Yeah.
Sometimes tee shirts you can win.
Oh,

695
00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:57.890
sometimes the cheaper the better.
Yeah,
that's,
target's got great clothes.

696
00:45:57.891 --> 00:46:00.920
They've got a few that marina line.
Yeah,
he's really good.

697
00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:04.490
I don't understand anybody that buys anything for a kid.

698
00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:06.830
Not at a target or old navy.

699
00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:09.980
I'm saying like if you go in there and you're like,

700
00:46:09.981 --> 00:46:14.870
kids don't know what you're putting on them or you could buy an entire wardrobe

701
00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:18.500
for $100 that's what we do for Lj.
I go online,

702
00:46:18.501 --> 00:46:22.730
old navy and I buy all his shit and then you know he grows out of it in two

703
00:46:22.731 --> 00:46:25.580
months.
Yeah.
Why would you spend,
but some motherfuckers been,

704
00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:30.880
I know cause once a lot we went to some strip mall boutiquey place and I bought

705
00:46:31.201 --> 00:46:35.540
her an outfit.
Yeah.
For like $100.
Yeah.
We're like,
oh no.
And I was like,

706
00:46:35.541 --> 00:46:37.720
oh this is great.
And then you realize he puts it on,

707
00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:41.060
he fucking throws shit on it and then he's like,

708
00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:43.480
and then it doesn't fit like in a week.
So I was like yeah,

709
00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:47.300
the last time I remember doing that.
And also with newborns.
They get you there.

710
00:46:47.301 --> 00:46:50.900
I remember we were at target and they're like newborn shoes.
You're like,

711
00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:54.230
motherfucker,
you're not going to put shoes on the newborn.
Don't even buy that.

712
00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:58.910
The only thing you should buy for a newborn is onesies.
Yeah.
And fuck a snap.

713
00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:03.080

That was in Greensboro again,

Not home.
You know what it is too.
I don't like to travel anymore.

Yeah,

I don't really enjoy traveling anymore.

Traveling wears on.

Just want to stay home.

775
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:09.860
Do you want to cringe at something?
Just that it's only,

776
00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.170
it's only at someone's a naivete.

777

It's not like a a cringe like gross things prime.
Is it me from road rules?

You want something so embarrassing.
You have to turn it off.
Yeah.

780
00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:26.000
It's called road rules a season six.
I listen to this.

781
00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:28.350
This is a hockey player getting interviewed

782
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:30.310
<v 10>policy.
Nelson Mandela,</v>

783
00:51:30.311 --> 00:51:33.640
one of the most significant historical figures in the 20th century.

784
00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:38.210
What knowledge or awareness did you have growing up or when did you learn

785
00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:41.500
nothing?
Well,
obviously growing up you,
yeah,

786
00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:45.260
it's one of the most known athletes in the world.

787
00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:49.810
<v 2>Mandela.
Yeah.
What did you let us know now?
What do you know about Nelson Mandela?</v>

788
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:56.030
<v 10>Just so,
I just wanted to ask you,
I mean obviously Nelson Mandela,</v>

789
00:51:56.031 --> 00:51:59.180
one of the most significant historical figures of the 20th century.

790
00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:01.190
What knowledge is so bad?
There's

791
00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:06.600
not much,
well,
obviously growing up here.

792
00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:07.660
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

793
00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:10.960
<v 10>This is one of the most known athletes in the world.</v>

794
00:52:12.810 --> 00:52:13.380
<v 2>Okay.</v>

795
00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:18.340
<v 10>Lot impact.
Any kind of sport that,
you know,</v>

796
00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:23.440
even playing hockey one knows him right from being the type of person that he

797
00:52:24.981 --> 00:52:29.810
was off the ice.
Fortunate that he passed away a year ago.
But

798
00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:35.550
<v 2>is there somebody whose name sounds like Nelson Mandela?
Sure.</v>

799
00:52:35.551 --> 00:52:36.900
That's what will be the explanation.

800
00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:38.540
<v 10>Just,
you know,
he,</v>

801
00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:43.550
he changed a lot while he was with us and he's a hard guy,

802
00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:45.163
huh?

803
00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:50.400
<v 2>Hockey and Johannesburg and you know,
maybe they're there.
Are they in Africa?</v>

804
00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:54.510
Cause it says giants of Africa behind them.
Are they in Africa?

805
00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:56.790
That's what I'm saying.
Oh,
I think you're right.

806
00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:59.010
And it says Nelson Mandela Foundation.

807
00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:06.680
So he's at Brady's in Joburg or something right there or at least something

808
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:10.050
affiliated South Africa.
Wow.

809
00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:14.380
<v 10>Uh,
I just think the way you met that is,
you know,</v>

810
00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:18.420
to me growing up playing sports and my parents was something really special

811
00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:22.980
share.
Uh,
you know,
being,
try to be a leader too.

812
00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:27.120
It says celebrating Nelson Mandela on that,
things like that where,

813
00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:29.580
you know,

814
00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:34.050
when your group sports do that one and that's it.

815
00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:41.160
<v 2>It's hard to watch.
It's hard.
I mean,
we're son of a bitch.</v>

816
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:45.810
This guy thinks he was a hockey player and he,
and he goes on.

817
00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:50.740
Oh my God.
Oh,
Toronto Maple leafs goaltender Jonathan Burn.

818
00:53:50.741 --> 00:53:54.900
Yay on Nelson Mandela had a one year anniversary of his death fundraiser.

819
00:53:55.930 --> 00:53:59.730
It is at his event.
And they're like,

820
00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:06.330
fuck you guys a fucking,
yeah.
You think you'd look it up,
right?

821
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:08.160
Or you think you'd ask,
Hey,

822
00:54:08.161 --> 00:54:11.610
who's Nelson Mandela and manners and he's a young guy.

823
00:54:11.611 --> 00:54:16.410
He didn't grow up with apartheid,
apartheid,
but you know,

824
00:54:16.411 --> 00:54:21.390
maybe black.
Yeah.
Oh Man.

825
00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:25.920
Maybe.
Yeah,
I dunno.
I mean fuck,
I know who he is,

826
00:54:25.921 --> 00:54:29.010
but that's because I grew up in the 80s.
I heard of Nelson Mandela every,

827
00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:33.210
every day on the news,
right?
Yeah.
That was a big story as a kid.

828
00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:39.390
<v 5>So here's a,
here's a,
I looked at,
I looked it up.
Um,
I guess this is old.
Yeah.</v>

829
00:54:39.391 --> 00:54:42.850
Because he,
you know,
it's a one year anniversary.
So this is,
we all miss,

830
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:43.651
make mistakes.

831
00:54:43.651 --> 00:54:46.710
But a mistake could be magnified when you're a celebrity and you say something

832
00:54:46.711 --> 00:54:47.544
incorrect.

833
00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:52.440
Maple leafs goaltender learned this weekend when he said South African President

834
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:54.630
Nelson Mandela is one of his favorite athletes.

835
00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:03.580
<v 2>Maybe he could play hockey Nelson,
who knows.
Yeah.</v>

836
00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:05.170
Not a lot of a hockey rinks.

837
00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:12.980
<v 5>He apologize.
After a game.
I was embarrassed.
I didn't mean to offend.</v>

838
00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:17.220
Offend him.
His legacy.
I got flustered with the red carpet and I was nervous.

839
00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:22.230
Um,
everyone makes mistakes.
And that was me that night.
Oh,
it seems like,
you know,

840
00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:26.740
<v 2>now was he,
was he in South Africa for the event?
No,</v>

841
00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:31.360
I don't think so.
No,
no,
no.
That would have been even way worser.

842
00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:36.230
<v 5>They hosted it in,
I want to say maybe in,</v>

843
00:55:36.231 --> 00:55:36.890
in Toronto.

844
00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:41.800
<v 2>Canadia yeah.
That's hilarious.
Oh,
he just thinks everybody is a hockey player.</v>

845
00:55:41.801 --> 00:55:43.450
That,
yeah.

846
00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:51.060
Yeah.
Well who knows?
Maybe he played hockey.
Yeah.

847
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:55.610
<v 5>Tell me.
No,
I don't think he did.
Huh,
man.</v>

848
00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:59.400
<v 2>And,
and,
and,
uh,
I liked that those journalists did not bail him.</v>

849
00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:03.500
Oh,
this is gold decks.
Yeah.
Just let him,

850
00:56:03.501 --> 00:56:08.150
if I can make a jerk out of themselves,
of course,
poor guy,
son of you,

851
00:56:08.170 --> 00:56:13.130
take it,
ask if you're going to the fucking fundraiser,
right.
Like,
Hey,
who's,
uh,

852
00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:16.290
who's this Mandela guy?
Right.
And it's ever heard of them.

853
00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:18.750
And then to go and that,
which is okay,
he's a young guy.

854
00:56:18.751 --> 00:56:23.650
Maybe he'd never heard of the man who,
you know,

855
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.640
<v 3>yeah.
End to apartheid.
Spent time in prison.</v>

856
00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:30.810
<v 11>Oh,
no.
Yeah.</v>

857
00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:35.840
I mean electric motor and 62 sprockets on the drive shaft as well as the input

858
00:56:36.081 --> 00:56:39.840
and output yolks when there is no operating angle on the,

859
00:56:39.841 --> 00:56:44.660
you joined the outpoured Yolk of the driven member that you joined the drive.

860
00:56:44.661 --> 00:56:47.780
Shit,
blow my nose now.
Hold together as the same speed.

861
00:56:47.781 --> 00:56:48.800
This is when you don't understand.

862
00:56:48.801 --> 00:56:51.980
Watch the tape on these sprockets and listened to the sound.

863
00:56:51.981 --> 00:56:56.981
The card makes as the drive shaft rotates at the same speed and you joined.

864
00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:09.360
<v 3>I want to so dumb.
Jesus.
That's terrible.
Yeah,</v>

865
00:57:09.930 --> 00:57:12.790
that was really bad.
You're black.
You're black.

866
00:57:12.791 --> 00:57:16.800
I remember when we went to South Africa and we had steaks every night around

867
00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:20.320
midnight and gain so much weight that we had to buy fatter.

868
00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:22.920
We're about the fattest clothes that they have in Africa.

869
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:26.700
We were the fattest people in Africa.
Yeah.
We gain weight.

870
00:57:26.701 --> 00:57:30.090
An African fattest clothes.
We sell.
Seriously.
We went to the mall.
Yeah,

871
00:57:30.210 --> 00:57:34.950
I remember.
And they're like,
oh,
we don't even have that.
Yeah.
Um,

872
00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:38.430
we were so fat.
I think these people are African.

873
00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:43.380
They're a covering a,
a Beyonce song.
It's pretty.

874
00:57:43.381 --> 00:57:45.180
It's pretty great.
You want to hear it?
Yeah.

875
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:47.503
<v 10>You play</v>

876
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:53.290
it is Cape Town yet,
dude,
I left

877
00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:56.513
everything.

878
00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:04.540
Everything you want in a box in the close.
Hello my stuff.

879
00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:09.240
Yes
miss.
That's fine.

880
00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:16.140
Sorry.
We'll go back to like,

881
00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:20.390
<v 3>that was terrible.
That's really bad.</v>

882
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:27.860
Horrendous.
Horrendous.
Yeah,
I did that.
But at the doe come into the bay.

883
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:31.100
I think my,
my son and I could've done a better cover of this.

884
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:36.560
Woo Man.
Dude.
I left.

885
00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:44.780
Was that an Afrikaans?
Well no that was,
that was English.

886
00:58:44.810 --> 00:58:48.560
But it's clearly not their forte.

887
00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:57.530
Yeah.
Hit that tee man.
Sounds like her.
Yeah.
We all day.

888
00:58:58.050 --> 00:59:03.050
We all say
hello.

889
00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:05.840
I miss out as Africa,
but let's go back.
I like it there.

890
00:59:05.841 --> 00:59:09.440
That was actually a great trip.
We didn't go to Cape Town,
which a lot of people,

891
00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:12.380
it was a bummer we didn't go to Cape.
Yeah.
Cause everybody was like,

892
00:59:12.381 --> 00:59:14.600
how can you come here and not go to Cape Town?
But we just,

893
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:18.170
we were there two full weeks to four weeks and we went to Durban.

894
00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:22.580
Joburg.
Yeah.
What else?
Um,

895
00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:27.320

There's one more place I think.
Yeah,</v>

896
00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:31.790

Oh Man.
But he could do it.
He would stop.</v>

905
01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:08.530
He would talk so much shit to Africans and they would laugh,
dude.
Yeah,
that was,

906
01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:13.120

But fuck,

Yeah,

913
01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:09.600
Pretoria.

914
01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:14.170
So widow,

What's up dog?

Okay.
You know what I'm saying?

916
01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:24.660
<v 5>Um,

It was such a great trip.
A lot of feedback online.
Uh,</v>

917
01:01:24.850 --> 01:01:26.830
on Facebook,

918
01:01:27.370 --> 01:01:30.020
social media and a,

919
01:01:30.050 --> 01:01:33.070
in the emails about a washcloth gate.

920
01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:37.100
<v 2>Oh No.
And we started a whole new debate.</v>

921
01:01:37.350 --> 01:01:41.860
<v 5>Yeah.
This is,
people are,
are very upset.
I mean,</v>

922
01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:44.010
I'll tell you in person,
I was,

923
01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:47.430
I was talking to people at shows and everybody was bringing it up.

924
01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:52.620
You're kidding.
Yeah.
What's the consensus?
It was pretty split.
I mean,
it was,

925
01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:56.340
it was nice of issue.
There was even a group that came up to me,

926
01:01:56.341 --> 01:02:00.720
it was two couples and one guy doesn't listen to this show.
So they go,

927
01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:04.960
Hey,
do you uh,
use a wash cloth?
And he was like,
what?
And they go,

928
01:02:04.961 --> 01:02:08.220
when you share this,
it's like talking to me.
And he's like,
yeah.

929
01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:13.230
And they were like,
Eh,
like you do?
He's like,
wait,
what's wrong with that?

930
01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:17.520
And they're like,
it's just gross.
And then the other guy was like,
yeah,

931
01:02:17.521 --> 01:02:19.020
what's wrong with your hands?
He's like,
well,
what's wrong?

932
01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.170
Like it was just funny that he had no idea what's going on.

933
01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:26.460
Here's an email.
Dear Tom and Christina,

934
01:02:26.461 --> 01:02:30.460
I'm writing a end to let you know that your discussion about using a washcloth

935
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:35.480
from episode three nine he was truly horrifying to me as a non binary gender

936
01:02:36.781 --> 01:02:39.540
fluid,
Hetero normative washcloth.

937
01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:40.280
<v 3>Okay.</v>

938
01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:45.280
It is deeply disturbing to me that you could suggest using a washcloth is only

939
01:02:45.921 --> 01:02:49.490
for poor people using a washcloth.

940
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:54.220
I didn't say that.
Yes,
you are person

941
01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:00.340
that's
using.
Oh Wow.

942
01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:06.350
<v 5>Is an effective way to keep the soap from slipping out of your hands being</v>

943
01:03:06.351 --> 01:03:07.184
washed away.

944
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:12.430
I can only assume that the poor butthole hygiene that Christina is constantly

945
01:03:13.401 --> 01:03:14.180
whining about,

946
01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:19.180
no whining about constantly stems from subpar washing habits such as these.

947
01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:26.120
Right.
If you pick up a few washcloths and give it a shot,

948
01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:28.120
you can finally get that butthole lake.

949
01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:30.680
You have always dreamed of good luck shot.
No,

950
01:03:30.681 --> 01:03:33.290
he's talking about me as I'm trying to tell you.
Oh,

951
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:37.220
you're saying that you complained about,
oh,
I'm whining about your butts.
Sorry.

952
01:03:37.221 --> 01:03:40.550
Yeah.
Well we have a bit days Huller yeah,

953
01:03:40.610 --> 01:03:42.910
the washlet three 50 he really takes care of them.

954
01:03:42.911 --> 01:03:46.040
No washlet three-fifty V he is unbelievable.

955
01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.500
Can you imagine she came off of that.

956
01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:52.550
You want to get off my butt after I use that?
No,
no,

957
01:03:53.070 --> 01:03:56.650
but my son accompanies me in the bathroom when we're alone in the morning.
Yeah.

958
01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:59.240
I just haven't come in there and he watches me take a shit.

959
01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:03.860
He likes to push the buttons to the bid day.
It's fun.
It's a family thing.
Yeah.

960
01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:08.550
Dogs come in,
they watch me Shit.
Um,
yeah.

961
01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:10.160
Another email.
Hi Christina.

962
01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:14.870
Tom is not making up the story about an older woman masturbating at the laughing

963
01:04:14.871 --> 01:04:17.900
skull bar.
I know that because I am that woman.

964
01:04:19.130 --> 01:04:23.000
I am not crazy and I was not gone as you implied.

965
01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:27.980
I am just an adventurous older woman who loves liking her being in public,

966
01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:32.240
especially when a big hairy bear like your husband is around.
Sure.

967
01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:37.010
I could tell he was enjoying the show.
Sincerely,
Mildred red bean.

968
01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:41.030
Thank you.
[inaudible] I'm so sorry.
I offended you Mildred.
So there you go.

969
01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:44.240
Right up.
Um,
who knew

970
01:04:46.310 --> 01:04:50.030
why I didn't think you made up the story that somebody was masturbating.

971
01:04:50.031 --> 01:04:53.870
Did I say that?
That I made that you were like,
that's not true.
Yeah.

972
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:59.030
Well,
it definitely happened.
Women don't do it as much as guys in public.

973
01:04:59.150 --> 01:05:02.870
Dude,
here is something that somebody wants advice on.
Yeah.
Okay,
so let's,

974
01:05:02.871 --> 01:05:06.020
let's see what you have for them.
Hey Jean,

975
01:05:06.590 --> 01:05:10.160
I was listening to the podcast today while going through my standard grooming

976
01:05:10.161 --> 01:05:13.190
routine while unloading my morning Brown,

977
01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:17.470
I happened to notice something that I have a tendency to forget instead routine

978
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:18.940
my toenails.

979
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:25.010
My wife is constantly reminding me to clip them.
Yeah,

980
01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:27.310
but I wear socks the majority of the time at home.

981
01:05:27.370 --> 01:05:31.450
It doesn't appreciate when I tell her I am the toenail champ.

982
01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.990
I know it should be standard practice to clip them off and,

983
01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:38.510
but my man talents do get pretty gnarly.
Oh.

984
01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:42.160
I want to know is what is a good amount of time between minimalizing my foot

985
01:05:42.161 --> 01:05:46.420
raisers and what should I do to help me remember?
Thanks in advance,

986
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:51.250
<v 2>Nasty Jake.
Nasty as shit,
right?
Change costume.
They are.</v>

987
01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:53.800
You remember you look at your nasty toenails,
motherfucker.

988
01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:59.170
Tell me all these nasty is healing that is so nasty that you need a reminder

989
01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:04.060
to just see how nasty you are then.
Yeah.
I mean I think

990
01:06:04.650 --> 01:06:09.510
<v 5>general rule is once you start seeing any significant length.
Yeah,
right.</v>

991
01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:13.440
And you just got the shit like toenail should be trim.
Yeah.
You know,

992
01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.780
not super short,
but like,
you know,

993
01:06:16.410 --> 01:06:20.580
it shouldn't be longer than the actual skin.
The Paj,

994
01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:24.050
<v 2>if you feel like as long then as long as long.
But he's like,</v>

995
01:06:24.051 --> 01:06:27.380
I don't remember that I have him loan.
That's nasty.
How do you forget?

996
01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:32.090
Well and also it starts to,
it starts to encroach on your shoe wearing,

997
01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:37.310
it'll start poking into your shoe.
No.
Have you ever done that where you're like,

998
01:06:37.311 --> 01:06:40.520
damn I toenails are long and got trimmed them cause they're poking into my shoe

999
01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:44.150
tab and to me before even feel it,
it's a little off that just,

1000
01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:46.820
you just see a man,
you just see it.
You're like,
this needs to get a trim.
Right.

1001
01:06:46.821 --> 01:06:50.180
You eyeball it.
When do you trim your toenails?
I Dunno,

1002
01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:52.340
I guess I can't think of how often they get done.

1003
01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:54.470
I feel like it's every couple of weeks.
Right.
Does that sound right?

1004
01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:58.130
How do you do it?
Do you get naked and then you put one foot up on the,

1005
01:06:58.340 --> 01:06:59.580
on the a sync?

1006
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:05.370
<v 5>No,
I just do it.
I just clicked the one to the floor in the bedroom anywhere.</v>

1007
01:07:05.371 --> 01:07:08.550
Whatever room I'm in.
Okay.
But I mean,

1008
01:07:08.551 --> 01:07:10.710
I do that at home sometimes I do it in the hotel room,

1009
01:07:10.770 --> 01:07:13.540
<v 2>but how do you do it?
You sit down with the toilet.
No,
I sit down.</v>

1010
01:07:14.410 --> 01:07:19.270
I'll sit down either on that chair.
You have your vanity chair?
No.

1011
01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:24.410
No.
You're not allowed to say yeah.
No leg up like this.
No.

1012
01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:28.730
Stinky.
Their clip.
Oh,
I'll do it on the edge of the bed.
Oh yeah.

1013
01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:34.000
Yeah.
Those are two places you're not supposed to do.
I do.
I don't give a shit.

1014
01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:38.740
No Shit.
Shit.
What'd he do with the clippings?
If you're doing it on the bed?

1015
01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:41.690
I just leave them wherever they go.
That's wrong.
Yeah,

1016
01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:44.680
but then I'm going to walk on it.
Our kids going to walk on it.
Yeah.

1017
01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.230
<v 5>I figured the dog's lead it.</v>

1018
01:07:48.590 --> 01:07:52.990
Sometimes it's fun to really examine,
um,
your big toe.
Okay.

1019
01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:57.030
<v 2>Toenail clipping.
Of course,
when it's like real thick,
that's what everybody does.</v>

1020
01:07:57.050 --> 01:08:00.750
Like,
whoa man.
It's all fascinating.
Yeah.
It's all yours.
Yeah,

1021
01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:04.670
but the little nails,
you're like,
eh,
but that big one,

1022
01:08:04.671 --> 01:08:06.350
if you get like a big chunky piece,

1023
01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:09.680
it's like the almond in the middle of those Chinese cookies.
Sometimes you get,

1024
01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:13.140
yeah.
I think you're doing it wrong.
Do you join them?
No.

1025
01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:15.980
Do you use them to floss?
Do you use them

1026
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:20.330
<v 5>as a tooth?
We do,
yeah.
Yeah.
Pick my teeth with them.</v>

1027
01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:25.100
Do you think you could switch rooms and do it in the bathroom instead?

1028
01:08:25.730 --> 01:08:28.740
A,
yeah.
If it's convenient at the moment I'll do it.
Yeah.
No,
no.

1029
01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:32.540
That's the wrong answer.
Do you think you can just switch to the sanitary room?

1030
01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:37.220
Nah.
Yeah.
Nah.
Nah.
Okay.

1031
01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:43.100
You Nasty.
Nasty as hell right now.
So nasty like that.
Um,

1032
01:08:44.790 --> 01:08:48.200
stop the fucking toenails,
dude.
Yeah.
This guy,
I mean,

1033
01:08:48.201 --> 01:08:51.790
I don't know what kind of advice I could do that had the advice is just kind of,

1034
01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:54.470
don't be nasty.
He's like,
I have socks all.
Yeah,

1035
01:08:54.471 --> 01:08:56.850
but you don't have socks on all the time.
No,
no,
no.

1036
01:08:56.851 --> 01:09:00.200
When you just get in the shower,
that's what the best time to do it actually.

1037
01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:04.070
I'd say free shower.
Yeah.
Right.
Cause you,
you get down,
you're,
you're naked.

1038
01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:08.410
You look down.
Oh okay.
Clip him.
You're done.
That's what I do.

1039
01:09:08.411 --> 01:09:11.420
Or when I get out of the shower cause they're softer.

1040
01:09:11.830 --> 01:09:14.930
The only other thing he could do is set up a,
a,

1041
01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:17.630
a routine where like,
he goes,

1042
01:09:17.631 --> 01:09:20.930
it'd be great if a guy who doesn't normally cut his toenails starts getting

1043
01:09:20.931 --> 01:09:24.860
pedicures.
It's a great idea.
So you could just go get your treatment,
you know,

1044
01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:28.220
and it'll cut it for you.
That's true.
This whole people have to do,

1045
01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:30.800
don't old people go to the doctor?
I know a guy,

1046
01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:35.840
a podiatrist who told me that for a celebrity,
an old celebrity,

1047
01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.400
he would go to his house to kind of stuff.
No.

1048
01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:42.710
Do House calls for like a really famous guy who does it.
Is he dead?

1049
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:48.380
Yeah,
he's dead.
Yeah.
But I don't,
it's like one of those Liberace.

1050
01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:52.490
No,
but it's somebody from like that era,
you know,
old school,

1051
01:09:52.491 --> 01:09:55.270
like a Cary grant type guy.
Ah,

1052
01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:59.940
I that'd be talking about like when he was,
you know,
85 or something.

1053
01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:03.380
That means somebody is going to have to do that for us.
Yeah.

1054
01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:07.130
And he said he would bring out the uh,
like the machine.

1055
01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:12.200
You can't just clip,
you'd have to like graze him down.
Nasty.

1056
01:10:12.201 --> 01:10:16.850
Why don't you just put like a memo in your calendar and your iPhone cut

1057
01:10:16.851 --> 01:10:20.050
toenails,
cut toenails.
Like put a reminder in there every two weeks.

1058
01:10:20.051 --> 01:10:23.600
Do you need that are paying attention?

1059
01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:29.210
Yeah.
It just looked down nasty.
Here's another email.
Hey Hitler,
it's me,
Danny.

1060
01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:33.680
Uh,
I've been dating my girlfriend for about a year and a half now.

1061
01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:36.470
She's got a beautiful daughter from a previous relationship.

1062
01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:39.380
As the relationship has grown more and more serious,

1063
01:10:39.381 --> 01:10:41.420
I'm getting closer and closer to the daughter.

1064
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:46.430
Last few months I've pretty much taken the father role over completely and now

1065
01:10:46.431 --> 01:10:50.900
I'm starting to get complaints from my family about the smell of my breath.

1066
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:56.480
I've always taken good care of my chompers.
You feel me?
Brush twice a day,

1067
01:10:56.630 --> 01:11:01.160
twice a day,
you know,
you know,
philosophy most days,
you know,
and you know,

1068
01:11:01.161 --> 01:11:03.290
regular visits to the dentist,
you feel me.

1069
01:11:03.650 --> 01:11:07.430
So I wanted to confirm that stepdad mouth is also a thing.

1070
01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:10.490
Keep them behind type stay glass.
And yes,

1071
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:13.980
I date my mom p s mommy.

1072
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:17.250
<v 2>Tommy is the posture champ,
the personality champ,</v>

1073
01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:21.690
the weight loss champ champ.
And most importantly the water champ.
Wrong,
wrong,

1074
01:11:21.691 --> 01:11:26.130
wrong.
I liked it.
I liked him up until that last sentence.

1075
01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.480
Thank you.
Thank you.
No Dad mouth is true.

1076
01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:32.790
Stepdad mouth and a lot of these can give you bad breath.

1077
01:11:32.791 --> 01:11:36.120
Your Diet can give you bad breath too.
Yup.

Yeah.

1089
01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:25.150
Nodding.
It could be one of those expos A's on dirty mechanics or something.

1090

Oh right.
Like,

Right.
Because that guy seemed like a real fucking dirt bag.
Yes.

1092
01:12:33.130 --> 01:12:35.980
That's why he's nervous.
He's saying,

It's a tick.

1093
01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:38.570
All right.
