6
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.670
If you got stabbed 12 times,

7
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.280
why the fuck are you still standing on that street that you just got stabbed on?

8
00:00:58.281 --> 00:00:59.470
What don't you never go there?

9
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.490
No fucking go there anymore.

10
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.200
And if you get shot on a certain neighborhood,
don't go to the neighborhood.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.700
<v 3>Yeah.
And what episode was that too?
I don't know how long ago.</v>

16
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.130
It was awhile ago and it was definitely a while ago.

17
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.690
<v 0>Look at you and blue van.
So thrilled with yourselves or your,</v>

18
00:02:01.691 --> 00:02:03.410
looks like you're hydrating with some coffee.
No,

19
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.060
it looks like I'm hydrating with a full,
oh,
I drank,

20
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.330
drank half of it before the show.
Where's your water bottle?
Oh,

21
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.480
Where is it Macy

22
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.810
even hiding that.
It's interesting.

23
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.540
I see you caffeine in front of you.
Yeah.
Why Hydro Down?
Dehydrate the same time.

24
00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:29.374
Cause I know what I'm doing.

25
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.080
<v 4>This is so childish.
It's you.</v>

26
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.680
You're so childish.
You drank like Ellis drinks out of a sippy cup.
Oh.

27
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.600
Oh,
that's it.
That's all.
You got one sip.

28
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.110
I know that you think you do volume.
Look next to me.
I have this one,

29
00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.670
a backup
and a third.
That's antiques.

30
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:05.300

Um,

I had a blast with you guys.
Absolutely blind.

36
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.280
Did you blast a lot there?
But I didn't.
No,
no.
That's surprising.

37
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.830
But it was a really fun shows and I think,

38
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.890
<v 4>oh you Jews for coming out.
I'm sorry.</v>

39
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.060
There's a huge Hasidic Jewish population.
No,
I,

40
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.770
they all stayed in my hotel last time.
I was there like acidic.
Um,

41
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.890
is that what you are moving or Ashkenazi connection?

42
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.580
What?
Are you serious?

43
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.230
He's just a type I know.
Has said Eric.

44
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.070
I said Eric Ashkenazi and Sammy Davis.

45
00:04:12.391 --> 00:04:13.224
What kind is there?

46
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.320
You can't hear what he's saying.

47
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.680
<v 5>Oh yeah,
it works when you put your mid on there.
There we go.
Yeah.</v>

48
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.470
Well Ashkenazi is like a white Jew.
Safari is a Spanish.
June.

49
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.620
The city is just religious.
So listen,
there you go.

50
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.210
It's too complicated.
Yeah.
You guys are so commonly.

51
00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:39.300
I think the real problem is that there's too many of you.

52
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.470
So let's make America great again.

53
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.320
Anyways,
next week I'm in a dribbly brown shit.

55
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.430

It's uh,

56
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.870
just outside of the Greater Cincinnati area.

57
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.970
<v 4>That means I'm coming home.
James.
Oh my God.</v>

58
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.540
I haven't been to my hometown in a while.

59
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.440
Are you going to take a pilgrimage to the hotel that it,
how do you think?

60
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.210
Of course,

63
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.400

What would the baby and

64
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.270
make it a family event?
Well,
I mean,
it's kind of a big deal.

65
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.010
We just sit there and weep for a week

66
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.760
<v 6>after that.
I am going to,
uh,

67
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.260
Uh,

Manly.
Daigo no,

70
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.860
Uncle Chichi I think is it is from the man man to lay blow.

71
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.750
I don't know.
Somebody put it command,
I dunno.
Anyways,

72
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:09.880
it's San Diego.
Um,

73
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.000
Yeah,
but somebody put like blow it Daigo or something like that.
That goes good.

74
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.410
So I'm in blower Daigo at the American comedy company and I'm very much looking

75
00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:22.770

Oh,

77
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.081

I don't know that this guy didn't pick it up for you on the way in today.

79

Do you think that this is the only thing that you're going to get loaded on

80
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.440

You don't think that you're going to get this?

81
00:06:38.441 --> 00:06:42.090
This is the beginning.
Maybe I was just going to sit back.

82
00:06:42.091 --> 00:06:45.060
Do you know that you're dealing with,

You're,

84
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.470

so I'm scared.
But you should be okay.

85
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.390
<v 4>You should be terrified anyways.
Um,

121

Yeah,

126
00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.480
we'll accomplish nothing.
Yeah.
How badly

127
00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.290
<v 7>do you</v>

128
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:00.263
<v 8>water?</v>

129
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:05.773
Okay.

130
00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.650
<v 1>Don't bring in one loving to them.
Well,
no.</v>

131
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.610
Well go to your mom's house,

132
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.673
Christina.

133
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.313
Okay,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.060
you're going to throw up.

135
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:07.800
<v 9>Okay,</v>

136
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.200
<v 7>so you shouldn't drink a gallon of fluid and an hour.</v>

137
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.260
I want to stare at an old boss to drink a gallon of milk and an hour.

138
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.173
It's different,

139
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:19.580
but I think it's a gallon of any fluid shouldn't do that and so I was going to

140
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.510
knock it out.
I'm just drinking like I don't want to drink.
Oh Bull Shit.

141
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:27.800
Bull Shit.
I've known you for so long.
So look at this.
Look at the Burke shaved.

142
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.750
<v 9>He looks worse than I thought.
You got it.</v>

143
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.450
You got to grow it back,
dude.

144
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.340
<v 7>Got To get that mouth,
Huh?</v>

145
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.890
Little checklists and then he's got a one big one though.
No,
that,
yeah,

146
00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.400
that I tried and stick in the front.
Yeah.
That thing.

147
00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:03.880
That's how you start your apples right there.
You got that.

148
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.560
You going to get anything going?

149
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.830
I think he has two or three on the bottom and that's it.

150
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:16.890
It is amazing that this guy decides that he is going to motivate people to

151
00:12:17.171 --> 00:12:20.500
strive to be that best.
He's not even motivated to get his teeth fixed.

152
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.390
He's not motivated for shit.
He's only motivation was to turn a camera on.

153
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.270
But that's the thing,
right?

154
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.440
He's clearly got a lot of things to work and you got really fired up in this

155
00:12:32.441 --> 00:12:37.030
thing.
You know he's real fat and sweaty.
If you do not thrive,
thrive,

156
00:12:37.031 --> 00:12:40.480
or strive to add some more teeth,

157
00:12:40.481 --> 00:12:43.660
we know the answer cause you're supposed to strive to be the best when you're

158
00:12:43.661 --> 00:12:48.190
missing teeth versus,
and you strive to be the best.
Thrive.
Thrive.

159
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:50.250
If you do not drive

160
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.480
fry her,

161
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.020
don't be the greatest tape.

162
00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:03.310
We'll accomplish nothing.
That's true actually.
Gladly.

163
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.170
Do you

164
00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:18.040
cause
this guy?
Where'd you find him?

165
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.650
<v 6>On Instagram.</v>

166
00:13:20.651 --> 00:13:24.700
And I don't even put it motivated the shit out of me that day I was sitting

167
00:13:24.701 --> 00:13:28.570
around in the hotel and wet and that sac and I go,
I'm gonna hit the gym.
Yeah.

168
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:33.310
And the dentist.
Yeah.
Did you make that boy,
I bought some floss right away.

169
00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:38.200
Jesus.
I'm not as bad.
Look,
there's a lot to go over,

170
00:13:38.201 --> 00:13:41.730
but we should point out the fact that we got new shirts on dude.

171
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:43.230
<v 7>Oh</v>

172
00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.440
<v 6>we did it.
This has been a dream and we finally achieved that.</v>

173
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:50.670
It had happened were wearing double pipe of classic shirts.
Look at that design.

174
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:55.700
Very rare.
Very rare is the tag.
And um,

175
00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:01.200
this is no shit.
You know,
a top dog obviously contributed to,

176
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.700
uh,
this,
this design coming along and sharing his,

177
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.450
his expertise on them.
Yeah.

178
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:11.440
And then last week after we recorded the show,
right,

179
00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:15.030
we had lunch downstairs,
sat down.

180
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.420
And if you go to Christina's Instagram,
yeah,
you can see me.

181
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.990
I got a thumb up and a thumbs down.
It happened.

182
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:24.000
I had a double pipe classic in front of her.
And Ah,
I mean,

183
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.960
I watched you cry for anything.
So station.
Yeah.

184
00:14:26.961 --> 00:14:29.130
It was [inaudible] son was there to witness,
you know,

185
00:14:29.131 --> 00:14:33.840
that I looked at the photo and I realized I'm in shock in the photo.

186
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:38.130
Right.
I go like,
oh,
like if you can see my face,
I'm like,
why?
Right.

187
00:14:38.131 --> 00:14:40.770
It just happened.
What's just right.
And I noted the time,

188
00:14:40.771 --> 00:14:45.630
even on the Instagram post.
Yeah.
Uh,
that it happened.
It was incredible.

189
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.553
Really incredible.

190
00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:50.440
<v 7>Well,
and what's funny is that it,
you know,
like with all double pipe classics,</v>

191
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.060
<v 0>it's a surprise.
You know,</v>

192
00:14:53.061 --> 00:14:57.440
you think you're just going to burp or you're just going to fart and then it

193
00:14:57.441 --> 00:15:00.740
happens and it,
you know,
and it's like you don't really,
right.
Yeah,

194
00:15:00.741 --> 00:15:04.430
that's right after it happened.
Look at your posts.
Right?
3:17 PM.

195
00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:07.940
June 20th,
2016.
I witness Tom having a double five classic.

196
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:11.600
They're extremely rare and you can't force them.
You can't make it rain.

197
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.650
Look at the shock.
Yeah.
The Dutch is,
look how thin you are there.

198
00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:19.240
Look how skinny you look.
I know some people that don't look,

199
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.110
that is um,
that's the moment man.
That was right right after it happened.
Yeah.

200
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:30.080
So we now have a double pipe,
classic shirts.
They're uh,
uh,
your mom's house,

201
00:15:30.081 --> 00:15:34.030
podcast.com there also,
uh,
in,
in my store,

202
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.340
Thomson [inaudible] Dot Com if you go to the shop page,

203
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:42.020
it's also there and it's just really exciting.
Now,
do you remember,

204
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.110
I remember you were kind of leaning over because you were,

205
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.360
I just think how did it have such a magical moment?
We had,

206
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:54.380
I think it was towards the end of lunch ordered Sushi and um,

207
00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.260
just finished wrapping it up.
And I,

208
00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.280
I remember feeling which was what did I feel coming first.

209
00:16:01.281 --> 00:16:06.281
I think I felt the fart brewing and cause that's when you leaned over and it

210
00:16:08.661 --> 00:16:13.610
looks impressive as I leaned over,
came out of the top of the same time.

211
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:18.860
And it was,
it wasn't,
you know,
that's the thing.
It's not burp fart.

212
00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.300
It's not fart.
Burp both.
Boom.
That's why it's so rare.

213
00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:27.590
That's why we wrote very rare because gas usually chooses a path that goes,

214
00:16:27.591 --> 00:16:29.040
I'm going up or I'm going down.
Right.

215
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.680
And the thing that happens with every double pipe classic is that you don't

216
00:16:33.681 --> 00:16:37.710
immediately know it happened because you're in shock.
So when you did it,

217
00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:42.720
hence like you did it and we both went,
oh,
that was a double pipe.
Yeah.

218
00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.870
Yeah.
They're just,
they are so rare.

219
00:16:44.871 --> 00:16:48.230
And it was so neat that it happened right after we had just discussed it.

220
00:16:48.231 --> 00:16:51.050
And Yeah,
I dunno.
It's an amazing thing for me too,

221
00:16:51.051 --> 00:16:56.051
is that it's really even more rare if I could say so to have a witness for one,

222
00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:02.110
sometimes you're alone and it's like,
oh,
you did.
Yeah,
sure.
Yeah.

223
00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.240
But when you have a witness,
there's no one can take it away from you.

224
00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:09.350
That's true.
You know,
it's like your college education and your double pipes.

225
00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:13.100
Yeah.
People are there for it.
So it was really,

226
00:17:13.101 --> 00:17:15.460
really something and we're very excited.

227
00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:19.610
We're very excited and wanted a double pipe,
classic shirt.
And then this,

228
00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.410
this is the one man,

229
00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:26.420
this is very rarely nice material off to it fits like a glove.
I love it.

230
00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:29.120
Shipping is included for all domestic offers.

231
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.520
That's true.
That's true.
I have,

232
00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:38.630
what's great about this shirt too is that it's on the down low.
You know,

233
00:17:38.631 --> 00:17:41.690
only other monies are really going to get it right.

234
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:46.300
And it doesn't say like Fart on it.
It's kind of subtle.
Some people,

235
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.130
when I picked it up from the shirt

236
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.420
<v 7>place,
the guy was asking me,
he's like,</v>

237
00:17:51.421 --> 00:17:55.170
is this like a like an x games event or something really,
really bad.

238
00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.470
Did you Clinton?
Yeah.
What did he say?
It was like,
oh,

239
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:03.730
better the next games.
Yeah,
you should send this to Tony Hawk.
Alright.
Alright.

240
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:08.700
Pipe.
Right.
So they're like,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Similar,
but not really.

241
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.860
I bet he's probably like,
Ooh,
I wish I could have one of those.

242
00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.430
Wish I could have a double pipe classic.
Maybe you will sir,

243
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:19.650
if you live long enough,
if you pray hard enough,
he just has to live long enough.

244
00:18:19.651 --> 00:18:24.390
I think that is the secret.
And don't force it.
Just be open to what happened.

245
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:28.380
I want to say I had one in 2015 and I want to say,

246
00:18:28.381 --> 00:18:30.420
I don't remember when it happened.
I don't think you did.

247
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:35.430
Well maybe 2014 2014 yeah.
So that's how long?
Two years man.
Yeah,

248
00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.800
he up anyways.

249
00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:39.740
<v 10>Okay.</v>

250
00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:40.573
<v 7>You know,</v>

251
00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:45.290
it's just because I just,

252
00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:50.530
I think you're really lucky in that you married someone who thinks that burps

253
00:18:50.531 --> 00:18:51.820
and farts are super funny.

254
00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:56.140
But I really like when you burp and make a sound like you just did,
like,

255
00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.960
like when you go,
Yup.
Or like,

256
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:07.540
just,
especially when you're doing in front of your mom in Florida or when she's

257
00:19:07.541 --> 00:19:12.040
around,
she's like,
ah,
and she's coming,
you know?
I know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I love it.

258
00:19:12.041 --> 00:19:15.310
Cause she gets mad at you for Bourbon and then she gets mad at me for laughing

259
00:19:15.311 --> 00:19:18.630
at your birth.
So it's like we get a double upset.
Charl yeah.

260
00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.090
I'm going to try to get her in here just to talk to her for awhile.

261
00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:27.610
Yup.
Yup.
I'll do some verbs in front of her just to get her to go.

262
00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:30.690
Because when,
no matter how much I hate,

263
00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.810
no matter how much I hate you or we're fighting,
if you go,
Yup.

264
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:37.330
It makes me laugh every time.
No matter how much I hate.

265
00:19:37.331 --> 00:19:40.310
Look how you might get for fighting or something.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

266
00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.890
You know what I'm saying?
Oh No,
no,
no.

267
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:49.360
Um,
so who was this guy?

268
00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.690
This guy you're going to fall.
So in love with it,

269
00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:56.050
I promise you are so toothy old old TUPE tubes.

270
00:19:56.470 --> 00:20:00.220
Oh,
got me thinking about motivation.
And then I also saw this guy,

271
00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:03.520
oddly enough also on instant saw part of this.
Yeah.

272
00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:08.460
And so I had a blue band pull it,
just,
um,
just give him a lift.

273
00:20:08.461 --> 00:20:13.140
And His name is Daniel Pena and he's a businessman who also is a,
uh,

274
00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:16.510
a coach,
like a mentor to people in the business world.
Okay.

275
00:20:16.511 --> 00:20:18.910
And this is that one of his seminars.

276
00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.560
He just dumbed down and shut off that part of his grain and just follow the

277
00:20:23.561 --> 00:20:26.070
steps.
You don't need fucking case studies.

278
00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:29.493
<v 10>Okay?</v>

279
00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:32.790
<v 7>You have a,
you have a fucking template.</v>

280
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.690
You have a mother fucking script that a fucking monkey

281
00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:43.200
that Alex wants a fucking case study because he wants to know the shit behind it

282
00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:45.930
cause he's stupid.
And that's why he's cooking poor.

283
00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.440
You don't need any motherfucking

284
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.353
<v 11>case study.</v>

285
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:55.180
How many fucking times do I have to say you had the fucking script?

286
00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:00.880
I said,
don't change a fucking word on the script.
Not a comma.

287
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.560
I love it if it's got misrep fucking one sending out Ms. Bell.

288
00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:13.770
The last thing you fucker need is a fucking case study.

289
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:17.310
They're all,

290

Harassing you.

Show me your friends and I'll show you your future.

301
00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:03.550
That's one of your top.

302
00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.960
Show me your friends and I show you your future.

303
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:07.820
You want to know why you're all fucked up?

304
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.490

Shit.
Are you sure?</v>

306
00:22:18.861 --> 00:22:22.300
His last name isn't like budgets without,

307
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:27.320
can you picture him like you're at the table and him telling you yes.

308
00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:29.990
This is a shit I heard grow by the way.

309
00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.540
<v 6>one of,

310
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:37.640
a coach obviously for people.
This is one of life's great truths.
Yeah.

311
00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:41.720
If you are in a place right now where you're like,

I know.
I really do.</v>

320
00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:12.560
Everybody needs to hear this guy.

321
00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.770
This guy's the right family members that need to see that.

322
00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:19.010
Somebody needs to see that.
Yeah,

He's totally,
this is the guru.

323
00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:23.630
This is who people should be listening to.
Yeah.
Not fucking Oprah and Dr Phil.

324
00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:27.520
This is the guy.
He's right.
You're hanging out with fucking losers.

325
00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:32.160

326
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:33.840
<v 11>Why you're fucking pad or,</v>

327
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.380
<v 6>okay,
sorry.
That was just the best.
That's just an ISO.</v>

328
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:43.980
Did you,

What's his name again?

329
00:23:43.981 --> 00:23:45.980

I gotta look this.

330
00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:50.920
<v 7>Brian,
do you have that whole thing in here?
The whole thing or no?</v>

331
00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:54.710
Holy Shit on the cheat sheets there.
Okay.

332
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:59.520
I must know more.
So is he like a billionaire or something?
Well,

333
00:23:59.521 --> 00:24:02.240
I dunno businessman.

I love him so much is the one I want to play for you and your friends are

335
00:24:06.831 --> 00:24:11.540
fucking losers.
You're a loser.
He's right.
He's right.
You're hanging out losers.

336
00:24:11.541 --> 00:24:16.530
You're going to be a fucking loser and hang out with winners,
man.

337
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:21.950
Holy Shit.
I used to hear this growing up all the time.

338
00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.640
This is the way my parents used to talk to me.
I mean it.

339
00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.040
I mean my dad has said the same thing.

340
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.730
<v 11>Sometimes we exchange emails and I'm like,
why does Dan have to be such a cunt?</v>

341
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.650
Why does he have to push it?

342
00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.580
Why does he have to always want to know I'm being just the opposite of a
country.

343
00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:42.420
That's right.
You're a cunt,
Brian,
not me.
Explain,
yeah,

344
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:43.833
you're weak

345
00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:48.500
and you're showing you and you want these people to like you and you're telling

346
00:24:48.501 --> 00:24:52.820
me I'm weak on that email
because you love me because you care.
Yeah,

347
00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:55.160
absolutely.
Thank you very much,

348
00:24:56.070 --> 00:25:00.640
guys related to be crazy and you can be more than you are at these little cons.

349
00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:05.660
Think that you're something now I see you a thousand times more.

350
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.600
Yeah.
See,
they have low standards.

351
00:25:08.601 --> 00:25:12.530
These fucking weenies to watch his fucking thing.
I know.

352
00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.510
I know what you can be.
They think you're a big fucking deal.
I know you're not

353
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:23.450
down deep inside brine.
No.
That I'm closer to being right than they are.

354
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.390
You don't agree with me 100% fine,

355
00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.670
but you know I'm close to and white than they are.

356
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.740
You're not the all end off shit.
Who gives a fuck and the cosmos the time.

357
00:25:33.741 --> 00:25:37.640
You are not a fart in the wind you need.
No one is exactly what you won't.

358
00:25:37.641 --> 00:25:41.110
You always worry to be a thousand times better.
Just like it.

359
00:25:41.111 --> 00:25:43.840
My daughter who's a British citizen,
this is HD butter.

360
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:48.730
<v 7>That British,
a line of furniture.
Oh really?
That's the showroom.
It's in.</v>

361
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:51.710
You know what I'm saying?
It's a furniture store to do this.

362
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:56.770
This is that British furniture company.
Probably.
It's,

363
00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.750
it's all the same company furniture.
Anyway,
that was really exciting.
Yeah.

364
00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.680
I really liked this guy.
Does he have a book I can read?

365
00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:07.820
I don't know if he has a book.
I have more audio of him.
Absolutely.

366
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:09.710
He's really spectacular.

367
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:12.240
<v 11>They think you're a big fucking deal.
I know you're not,</v>

368
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.100
<v 7>you're a cunt.
And to talk to me about what,
what's,</v>

369
00:26:16.101 --> 00:26:18.800
I mean for those first few days,
what would have been the reactions from people?

370
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:21.890
Do you get people that want to leave?
Do you get people that want to cry?

371
00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:26.550
Just talking about,
so this guy,
he lives in a castle in Scotland.
Oh cool.

372
00:26:26.551 --> 00:26:30.380
In your opinion.
Does good for the winter.
That's why.

373
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:34.580
And people pay a lot of money to go and sit in like that room that you,

374
00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:39.500
you heard him telling people you're fucking poor that's at his castle.
I love it.

375
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:44.520
So these are people who,
you know,
his story is that he turned,
uh,

376
00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:49.380
I think it was $8 into 430 million so that he had,

377
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:54.440
he was some high ranking executive and an oil company.
And I dunno,
he's been a,

378
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:57.120
he's been a coach for business people,

379
00:26:57.121 --> 00:27:00.060
but he just has this persona,
you know,

380
00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.240
sort of some people cause you can tell not to push him.
I mean you must,

381
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.620
you must have to know you a little bit or not push him.

382
00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:10.440
<v 11>No,
no.
We've had people piss their pants.</v>

383
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:14.160
We've had people pass out.
Yeah,

384
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:17.900
we've had people,
shit,
their pants,

385
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:22.640
a partner in a big four accounting forum.
Shit,
his pants.

386
00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.670
The person that passed that was a psychiatrist.

387
00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:31.990
We've got Harvard medical doctors.
We've got pass out.
Why would they,

388
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:33.230
I mean they just did.

389
00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:37.110
<v 7>Okay.
Just the stress,
the stress of hanging out with this.</v>

390
00:27:37.111 --> 00:27:38.360
We can you imagine that?

391
00:27:38.361 --> 00:27:42.680
The stress being around me make people pass out Pearson shit themselves.

392
00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:48.150
What a psycho.
I love it.
Has anyone ever said fuck you damn pain?
Yeah,

393
00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.220
I'm walking out the door.

394
00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.820
<v 11>No,
I've thrown a couple out,
but nobody's ever said that.
No,
I take that back.</v>

395
00:27:53.821 --> 00:27:58.650
One one Romanian walked out the door because he said I was making fun of them

396
00:27:58.651 --> 00:28:03.300
calling them a Gypsy Roma.
But then when we came back in the afternoon,

397
00:28:03.301 --> 00:28:08.190
he was sitting in the library and I thought,
I thought you left.
He says,
no,
no,
no.

398
00:28:08.191 --> 00:28:12.230
You were right.
I'll be the first.
If I walk,
if you walk you'll be,
well,
you'd be,

399
00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.660
there'd be plenty of guns here,
but you may be the first cut the walk out.

400
00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.490
<v 7>You gotta get to Scotland.
Geez.</v>

401
00:28:20.491 --> 00:28:22.920
I want to sign up for the similar stuff and it'd be like,

402
00:28:22.921 --> 00:28:27.300

I got to go.

403
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.980

Let's find out.

404
00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:35.130
It's true.
Shit.

Megan,

405
00:28:35.131 --> 00:28:40.131
Can you put a gun to buy every fucking person that you email?

406
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.320

What are you goals on this other side of the paper?

409
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:52.340
They have anything to do with hilarious length.

410
00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:56.200
Lincoln didn't fuck cause it's for fucking losers.
This he

411
00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:00.000
<v 11>p heads watching this thing like me.</v>

412
00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.210
You said they're either going to love you or hate you.

413
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.980
I knew which one it would be.
All my life.

414
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:12.840
I've been this way and all my life.
People love me and respect me.

415
00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:17.920
Wow.
If you're in a foxhole put,
do you want him to fucking Fox with you?
Be Fine.

416
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:23.590
You want some mealy mouth con asshole or you want somebody to do that in a rip

417
00:29:24.091 --> 00:29:25.530
their head off and shit down their neck.

418
00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:30.600
<v 7>I'm in love.
I told you,
I think I'm in love,
Tom.
Sorry.</v>

419
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:35.760
I love this guy.
I listen to everything he says.

420
00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:39.300
Yeah.
God Damn.
I wish she taught a school seriously.

421
00:29:39.301 --> 00:29:43.330
I'd send my kid to his school to teach them not to be fucking pussies.
Right.

422
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:46.540
Like today.
The kids that,
you know,
these kids are fucking mollycoddled.

423
00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.840
That's how old school.
I love it.
I love old school craziness like this.

424
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:53.260
It's great.
Uh,
it makes me so happy.

425
00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:56.080
It doesn't that make you feel safer in the world when there are people like him.

426
00:29:56.530 --> 00:30:00.670
Well,
you need,
you need guys like that.
No,
you do.
You need like no nonsense.

427
00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:05.380
Normal people.
Yeah.
God,
I made me feel like I was a home again.
I liked it.

428
00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.720
There was,
I know it.
It feels real familiar,
right?
No,
it's my parents.
The,

429
00:30:09.721 --> 00:30:14.720
everyone talks like this where I,
where I came from,
honestly,
like to have a,

430
00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:18.100
like Americans who are nice and stuff,
that freaks me out.

431
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:21.670
That makes me feel uncomfortable when a guys like this guy,
this,

432
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:26.090
this could be my mom.
Yeah.
Mom and dad.
So it just feels so familiar.

433
00:30:26.091 --> 00:30:29.410
It feels right at home,
man.
Ah,
I felt good.
There's one here.
I don't,

434
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:32.980
I don't see it in here,
but he,
he did,
he did an interview in a car.

435
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:35.350
Do you remember that one?
Oh,
that's my baby.
Next one.
I know.

436
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:38.800
He did an interview in a car where this guy's like,
how's it going?
He goes,

437
00:30:38.801 --> 00:30:42.530
great sun shines out of my asshole.
And like,
I was like,
all right.

438
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:46.880
You can tell him no one's prepared for it.
Yeah.
It's crazy.
Yeah,

439
00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:53.440
man.
Yeah.
He's got quite a map.
It,
it,
it does sound like your,
your family.
Yeah.

440
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.980
Yeah,
yeah.
That's really my dad taught.

441
00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:01.180
My mother would talk like this more.
Yeah.
This guy's probably mentally ill too.

442
00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:06.170
I'm serious.
It might be right.
Hey,
uh,

443
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:10.420
do you want to Persian lady a voicemail update?
I would love one.
I fucking love.

444
00:31:10.421 --> 00:31:14.530
One time.
She's a fucking loser.
Fucked up.

445
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.670
Fucking bumps.
Quitting.
No losers.
Um,

446
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:25.840
so here's the,
uh,

454
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:06.900
Okay.
Yes,

455
00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:10.630
<v 7>Jesus.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.</v>

456
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:14.470
We're always waiting for the,
uh,
for the,
you know,

457
00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:18.640
the,
the scoop on what's really going on here.
Oh my God.

458
00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:24.220
We know that this is,
this goes deep,
you know,
I mean,
this course,

459
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:28.180
these messages never stopped coming in.
I want to credit,
do you know who left us?

460
00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:32.610
Who set this in?
Um,
no.
No.
God.

461
00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:38.040
Hmm.
Okay.
Well,
uh,
we got an actual person,

462
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:40.550
um,
and I'm sorry,
we're not crediting you correctly.

463
00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:42.920
<v 6>Who sent in an MP three.</v>

464
00:32:42.921 --> 00:32:47.510
So he actually says what she said.
That's so much better.

465
00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:51.650
Yeah,
it's great.
So this is what she is saying.
Okay.

466
00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:55.860
<v 12>Hello?
Salamay those plastic bags I told you about.</v>

467
00:32:55.861 --> 00:32:59.520
Put those ones that you get tomatoes and herbs from the supermarket.

468
00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:04.290
Put them on your trees.
Oh my God.
Those chipmunks and not going up there at all.

469
00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:08.070
They keep eating my figs and keep worrying that they're going to eat all my

470
00:33:08.071 --> 00:33:11.910
blackberry's now.
They're not touching them at all.
I feel so good.

471
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:15.000
They've all disappeared now hurry up and grab those bags.

472
00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:17.940
I've got to do the same.
Put them all over on your branches.

473
00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.310
Start from the bottom and work your way up to the top.

474
00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:25.300
Those motor sluts have all disappeared now.
Okay,
talk to you soon.

475
00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:32.410
<v 6>That's amazing.
Please.
So great.</v>

476
00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:38.800
Of course,
by the way,

477
00:33:38.801 --> 00:33:43.570
it might be really mentally.
Start from the bottom put.

478
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:48.550
She's putting this lady grocery bags all over trees.
You understand him?

479
00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:53.410
Horrible.
Must not look in her house.
You got to give some to to the animals.

480
00:33:53.411 --> 00:33:57.540
So that's the way it works.
It's like animals get away with that shit.
Squirrels.

481
00:33:57.541 --> 00:34:01.610
They're probably suffocating.
No,
I'm just like,
oh,
thanks a lot.

482
00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:05.920
That's how I live.
I eat.
You're so funny.

483
00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:09.250
So she's got a crazy tree with bags on it right now.
Oh yeah.

484
00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:13.270
What a fucking not yeah,
immigrants,
man.
They don't give a fuck.

485
00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:18.420
They do everything crazy style by the way.
Funny salivate.

486
00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.790
You have a lot.
I,
there's a strong,

487
00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:28.830
there's a strong backlash against you in the the water championship.

488
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:33.770
How are we going to fuck up?
Yeah,
I think we should.
Um,

489
00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:37.480
so we put a poll out there.
Oh fuck.

490
00:34:37.481 --> 00:34:42.390
Off to see on these losers.
A bunch of fucking losers.
I answered you.

491
00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.890
Okay.
It's fine.
It's over.
Now.

492
00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:49.660
The 69% time,
31% jeans.

493
00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:54.930
Um,
why don't you ask fucking Daniel and your Lincoln Den.

494
00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:59.950
A lot of people feel like you know that you can't be trusted for a number of

495
00:34:59.951 --> 00:35:04.730
reasons.
Here's an,
here's an example.
Uh,

496
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:09.610
Tom is the best.
He's not a big fat liar.
Like the non main mommy.
Eight oh eight.

497
00:35:09.611 --> 00:35:13.210
Remember that wasn't a lie.
That was just misinformation.
I did not know.

498
00:35:13.211 --> 00:35:17.650
And then deliberately lie,
obviously bigger gulps.

499
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:23.050
That's cause you're bigger.
You're just a bigger animal than me.
Big,
stupid,

500
00:35:23.051 --> 00:35:24.220
stinky,
dumb bear.

501
00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:28.270
The water champion drinks more water necessarily because you drink less

502
00:35:28.271 --> 00:35:32.680
frequently,
uh,
than I do even though I sit all day.

503
00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.890
But how is this even a debate?
The hair?

504
00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:38.040
Is this even a question

505
00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:39.760
<v 0>Tom was taking bigger steps?
No,</v>

506
00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.170
hence what this is the tortoise and the historical evidence.
Your honor,

507
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:47.610
your honor.
Look at the physical evidence.
Your honor.
This is what's known as a,

508
00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.670
it's a long race.
It's a marathon that I run.
Okay.

509
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.460
You do your sprints and I'm in for the long haul.
Bitch.

510
00:35:53.461 --> 00:35:56.730
The tortoise wins says put genes.
Key is the SIP chain,

511
00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:01.280
but pure water intake,
it's buns all day.
Go Fuck yourself and your,

512
00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.930
your stupid fucking Twitter followers.
You know what?

513
00:36:03.931 --> 00:36:07.800
I actually feel like I actually feel like maybe,
okay,

514
00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.880
maybe you agree with them.
I think you agree with them.

515
00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:13.170
Now I'm not even going to,

516
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:17.430
I think you maybe

517
00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:22.500
that I am the water champion.
I think you think I'm water champion.

518
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:27.210
I think here's the evidence.
Are you hydrating after your boxing of at me?

519
00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:30.930
I have two liter and a half of water.

520
00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:36.060
Got To hydrate soldier.
You know,
hydrating isn't just for graduates.

521
00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:40.710
The Florida graduate.
Oh,

522
00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:44.970
people want to hear that
you drink like an animal.

523
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.230
That was one swag for Tommy,
that that amount that you just drank.

524
00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:53.780
And I could never do that in one.
Not In one swoop.
You drink like a bear.

525
00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.710
Okay,
so what is,
I just said that now and that's historical.

526
00:36:57.711 --> 00:37:00.780
So what you're saying,
Tom,
you're the water champion.
Did not say that.

527
00:37:00.781 --> 00:37:04.200
I said I could not do that because I'm,
I don't weigh whatever it is.

528
00:37:04.201 --> 00:37:09.201
You and Bert collectively way I don't have the big stomachs like you and Bert.

529
00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:12.990
So you're not drinking enough water.
No,
I am.
I'm just,
it's a slow burn.

530
00:37:12.991 --> 00:37:15.390
What did I tell you?
It's a marathon.
You're sprinting.

531
00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:19.180
That's what fucking dilettante water drinkers do.
Like yourself?
No,

532
00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.710
you could never drink as much water.
Well,
let's over the course of a few,

533
00:37:22.711 --> 00:37:24.870
your honor,
your honor,
maybe a few days.

534
00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:28.050
Let me allow me to introduce my evidence from Twitter.

535
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:32.400
J at big Jay savage rights.
If Tom had enough water,

536
00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.350
he wouldn't be Dj dad mouth.

537
00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:38.850
It's because you're so dehydrated and smelly from drinking coffee and not enough

538
00:37:38.851 --> 00:37:42.810
water.
That's why our Dj Dad mouth.
That's not true.
It's not true.

539
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:44.640
I'm the water champion.
First of all,

540
00:37:44.641 --> 00:37:48.060
I appreciate you voting me the water champion.
I'll never let you down.

541
00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:52.920
I'll continue to drink far more water seen it could ever drink.

542
00:37:52.921 --> 00:37:53.880
This poll is rigged.

543
00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:57.690
I don't believe for a minute that that the listeners thing at the end of the
day,

544
00:37:57.691 --> 00:38:02.400
your rig at the end of the day though,
who has drank more water,
this is nonsense.

545
00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:07.770
I swear to God I do.
Can I tell you why?
Last night before we went to bed,

546
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.430
I had by my bed stand to full avi-on bottles.

547
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:14.850
What did you have next to your bed to drink at night,
Tom?

548
00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.180
Now you're just showing off.
This is all for the cameras.

549
00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:21.180
You know that he never does this when the cameras are off.
Tom,

550
00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.580
how much water did you have next to your bed last night?

551
00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:26.520
I guess it was like a liter and a half.
No wrong.

552
00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:31.260
A tiny little shitty cup.
A mug.
You could never drink as much water.

553
00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:35.590
Okay.
Okay.
I just had another report and from uh,

554
00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.110
someone who went to see you in west Nyack.
Okay.

555
00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.590
That Tom didn't drink water at the entire time.

556
00:38:41.591 --> 00:38:45.880
He was on stage and that's at least an hour that had gone by.

557
00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.260
No,
it's true.
It's on Twitter versus

558
00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:56.490
well you must be severely dehydrated because you're sweating up there and you're

559
00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:01.120
moving and you do your routine where you pretend to have sex with a stool and

560
00:39:01.121 --> 00:39:03.880
you like Bruce Bruce.
Do you have the towel?
You're always sweating.

561
00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:08.500
I drink so much water after sets.
As soon as I get offstage I drink,

562
00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:12.100
I dunno cause you're dehydrated.
Severely notes from all of the talking.

563
00:39:12.101 --> 00:39:15.370
I'll drink like 16 after a show and people,

564
00:39:15.371 --> 00:39:17.500
those of us that hydrate properly,

565
00:39:17.501 --> 00:39:20.020
consistently throughout the day bring the water on stage.

566
00:39:20.021 --> 00:39:22.600
You need to work on your concession speech.
That's it.

567
00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:28.030
I competed.
I lost.
And your nominee is,

568
00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.000
can I send you a photograph?

569
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:34.200
I sent you a photograph but I'd like to pull it up right now your honor.
Okay.

570
00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:38.540
This is the photo.
That's what you're saying.
That's what the word photograph is.

571
00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:42.620
Shore photo is a shortened version of photograph.
What the fuck is this?

572
00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:46.910
This is a picture of me when I was born.

573
00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:50.270
Could you please pull it up as evidence of what's happening?

574
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:54.350
What does it show you?
What does I do in the minute I came out of my mother?

575
00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:59.680
What am I doing?
Yeah,
you have what?
You're holding a bottle of water.

576
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:06.040
This is so unnecessary.
Why?
Graphic evidence?

577
00:40:06.041 --> 00:40:09.880
This is me being born and I already have water in my hand right now.

578
00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:13.060
Don't believe that.
I don't believe it and I'm going to fight this verdict.

579
00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:17.700
You're fucking Bernie Sanders right now.
I have the nomination.

580
00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:22.780
You're George Bush.
No,
I have the vote.
I have the votes.
This is Florida.

581
00:40:22.781 --> 00:40:27.070
I demand a recount are in.
I demand a recount.
This is the Chad.

582
00:40:27.071 --> 00:40:31.860
This is a hanging Chad.
I don't know who these people are and it doesn't.

583
00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:35.230
There's not enough water.
That's you.

584
00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:41.080
That's you right now I will give you this puny fake Twitter fan.
Loser.

585
00:40:41.081 --> 00:40:45.510
Victory.
Fake.

586
00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:50.300
The the,
the voting.
No,
that was,
that was real.
I don't care.

587
00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:53.810
Listen,
I was like 1200 people but 1200 listen,

588
00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:58.710
I'll give you your stupid loser Twitter poll.
Like everybody,

589
00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:03.510
1,348 votes.
You lost by it a lot.
Okay?

590
00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:07.110
You know what?
I'll give you this bullshit victory today.

591
00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:09.650
Why is it a bullshit Vic?
Cause it's fucking wrong bro.

592
00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:13.350
You don't know the truth bomb.
You know why you're a fucking loser.

593
00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:17.730
You drink water with losers.
Okay.
At least I drink wine.

594
00:41:17.731 --> 00:41:20.160
I don't know where your office is locked up.
This is all for show guys.

595
00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:23.340
His his bullshit water jug.

596
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:26.300
Which blue band picked up for you on the way in?

597
00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:29.280
Don't think I don't fucking notice that because I,
that shit was cold.

598
00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:32.940
It wasn't in our fridge.
No,
it wasn't in our fridge.
Not True.

599
00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:34.763
Hello?

600
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:38.420
<v 7>I always ask who gets the Sparkletts in the house?
Who makes sure that shows up?</v>

601
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:41.180
Who orders bottled water so that you can hydrate properly.

602
00:41:41.181 --> 00:41:42.500
So sad to see somebody just

603
00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.370
treading water that they can't drink.

604
00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:54.800
There's a video.
I have a view in west Nyack.
This is for now to,
okay,

605
00:41:55.220 --> 00:42:00.220
well I'm just letting you know that someone saw you in west Nyack and they took

606
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:05.210
it again.
They took footage of you.
He didn't know you were being watched.

607
00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:10.580
Okay,
here we go.

608
00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.313
<v 8>Tom,</v>

609
00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:09.080
<v 7>why you that lady's car?
I want this lady.
I've never said this,</v>

610
00:43:09.081 --> 00:43:11.150
but I want her to get eaten by a bear so badly.

611
00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:14.510
She's trying to reason with the bear.
This is the most part.

612
00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:19.680
If that camera could of kept rolling and he'd just devoured her mind.

613
00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:24.170
That funny documentary we watched hilarious dot Timothy Treadwell.
That's right.

614
00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:28.450
That's how I know you and I would be married,
but it was retarded you.

615
00:43:28.451 --> 00:43:33.451
When I went to see that documentary when we were just dating and the Timothy

616
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:37.930
Treadwell,
what was it called?
Grizzly man.
And we saw it in the theaters.
Narrator,

617
00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:41.480
the director.
I remember the German got Santa hats on down now.

618
00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:44.120
And there is a part where the guy goes,
yeah,

619
00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:47.600
we thought we just thought Timothy was retarded and you and I laughed out loud

620
00:43:47.601 --> 00:43:51.470
together and no one else,
no one else lives here.
And when he got mall,

621
00:43:51.471 --> 00:43:56.120
we were dating.
It was a dating period.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And I was like this guy,

622
00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:59.450
the whole time he was talking about it and so many bears on that,

623
00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.620
like he'd make those videos were like,
this is fucking down.

624
00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:06.900
And then Verna was like,
there was a special connection,
no Canadian in the bank.

625
00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:10.980
The connection was the bear was going to eat you this guy.
He was like,
yeah,

626
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:13.030
this is my little Fox Fox.

627
00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:17.220
He had one of those things like a fucking eight year old woman that gets a bird

628
00:44:17.221 --> 00:44:22.060
and calls it like Birdie,
you know,
this is bear bear box.

629
00:44:22.061 --> 00:44:23.450
He so dumb.

630
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:28.520
He was living on a bare reserve and he thought he was protecting the bears.

631
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:32.400
Frog will fight for these barriers.
It was a crazy person.

632
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:36.270
<v 6>Totally agree.
Yeah.
Being out with dangerous bears and then he got eaten by them.</v>

633
00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:38.850
Yeah.
What a shocker.
Yeah.
Big Dummy.

634
00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:43.110
Big fucking dummy hanging out with losers and he got eaten by them.

635
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:47.800
Absolutely.
Um,
let's get into this real quick.

636
00:44:47.801 --> 00:44:51.840
A update on Burton and
his fatness.

637
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:57.670
God,
no.
So never,
never.
It just keeps morphing into something better.

638
00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:03.550
You know,
we owe it to the listeners and everybody to play a lot,
uh,
uh,

639
00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:08.220
of Bert.
Yeah.
You know,
people think that we're,
you know,
we're best buddies,

640
00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:13.140
man.
I think people need to know that this is not a one sided things.
Right.

641
00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:17.480
We're bringing you the other side of the coin.
Here's Burt on a,

642
00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:22.290
hey Jay hawks podcast,
the hot cast,
uh,
Kinda filling him in on,

643
00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:23.400
on some of this stuff.

644
00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:28.180
<v 13>Incompetence.
I tell him I'm the fattest I've ever been getting.</v>

645
00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:32.090
Buns shares that with everybody.
God dammit.
Burt looks like Gerard.

646
00:45:32.091 --> 00:45:35.840
Depardieu so to be,
that's right.

647
00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:39.500
<v 6>That was a few months ago.
But to be fair,
I want to say this.</v>

648
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:43.070
He did not say in confidence.
He started making videos.

649
00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:45.100
I'm the fattest I've ever been.
Right.

650
00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:47.930
It was public about it and he was weighing himself on,

651
00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:51.380
like weighing himself on videos.
Yeah.
Sang that.
So it wasn't,

652
00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:56.390
that's the bird has a way of twisting,
you know?
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

653
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:58.030
He was making,
I'm so fat,

654
00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:01.070
<v 13>trying to lose weight.
My agent called at one point it was like,
hey,</v>

655
00:46:01.071 --> 00:46:04.430
you're trending right behind Kesha and Amy Schumer and fat shaming.

656
00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:09.200
<v 8>Okay,</v>

657
00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.690
<v 13>Georgia might,
my 12 girl pulled me aside and goes,
Daddy,</v>

658
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:15.110
people say really mean things to you online and I go,
baby,
it's not real.

659
00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:19.810
It's not.
The Internet's not real.
I go in my head,
I'm like,
I go there.

660
00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:22.080
My fans too,
but then part of me is like RNA.

661
00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:26.220
<v 8>Okay,</v>

662
00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:27.160
<v 13>no.
Here's the thing.</v>

663
00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:31.060
Here's the thing you can do right now is I am overweight like I am.

664
00:46:31.061 --> 00:46:35.500
The second fatness I'd ever been in my life.
The second by second bedroom.
Oh,

665
00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:39.710
only second to the time I told Tom Campaign,

666
00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:41.883
oh man,

667
00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:48.070
she's a hammer and booster.

668
00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.440
Like Liam's got a lot of one that's like bird looks dark.

669
00:46:55.441 --> 00:47:00.040
Gerard Gerard Depardieu.
Apparently we have some similarities.

670
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:06.980
<v 6>Remember that naked?
It was a nude photo,
nude photo where they,
they did look,</v>

671
00:47:06.981 --> 00:47:10.700
he has a similar bloated,
distended,
swollen.

672
00:47:10.701 --> 00:47:14.200
Now Gerard is a little bit bigger.
I'll give him that,
but not by much,

673
00:47:14.201 --> 00:47:18.650
but now by a lot,
maybe five pounds.
I'm six feet.

674
00:47:18.651 --> 00:47:20.000
You're six one like that kind of thing.

675
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:24.560
<v 13>Yeah,
I think they put the meme together.
Would it put your face on his bottom?
And</v>

676
00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:30.860
there are barely a lot of fat babies that look a lot like

677
00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:38.740
God.
It's Co,
you know,
Tom and I find it more funny than not,

678
00:47:38.741 --> 00:47:41.200
especially when like a publicist is like,
hey,

679
00:47:41.201 --> 00:47:44.200
you're not getting a lot of good feedback on the show.
And I was like,
really?

680
00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:46.540
She's like,
all anyone can tell yourself that

681
00:47:56.790 --> 00:48:01.420
is they don't technically fat shame the fattest people,

682
00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:06.650
big fat shame.
The people who were on the fence of like notes happened.

683
00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:10.120
No one really says it to me,
but he's not just talking about us.

684
00:48:10.121 --> 00:48:11.490
I think he's talking about fat shaming.

685
00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:17.410
People get fat shamed on the cusp of obesity or people who you know,

686
00:48:17.411 --> 00:48:22.060
shouldn't be fat.
That's how it goes.
I mean,
that's all the stuff.
Like when I get,

687
00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:26.440
I've got,
uh,
a lot of fat comments over the years and people who are like,

688
00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:29.950
you're a piece of shit.
You should be,
you shouldn't be this fat.

689
00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:34.000
Not like you're 400 pounds.
They're just like stop being lazy.

690
00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:38.800
Cases that are like well into four or 500 people,

691
00:48:38.801 --> 00:48:39.634
you're dying.

692
00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:42.910
You don't see people bombard those people because they already feel like shit

693
00:48:42.911 --> 00:48:47.470
and I imagine when you're,
that big shit goes down and I just want to eat.

694
00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:55.600
That's a guy who doesn't get it.
Why are you,
what are you talking about?

695
00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:58.420
I want to get this to stop it.
I want to get skinnier than Tom.

696
00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:01.220
I am skinnier than he is not.

697
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:06.220
He is not skinny in good shape.
Oh my God.

698
00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:10.300
Everyone who was here and I go,
hey,
we weighed the same.
Does it look different?

699
00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:15.130
He's,
yeah,
he's in such good shape.
He's never been out of shape.

700
00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:17.900
You know what I mean?
That's a lifetime of never being out of shape.

701
00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:21.100
Does Burt actually way,
like what do you,
what are you guessing?

702
00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:25.760
What do I think he was?
I Dunno.
Three.
I don't know.

703
00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:31.310
I don't know.
I don't know.
Boys weights now probably three ten three times.

704
00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:35.830
You're putting all this morning now.
I feel bad.
I don't know if many people,

705
00:49:35.831 --> 00:49:38.920
I haven't heard much from him.
He had me do a little promo.

706
00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:42.110
Wait,

707
00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:49.960
look at Birch reaction when he finds out though.
This is the best.

708
00:49:49.961 --> 00:49:53.140
So you're putting all this,
I mean,
now I feel bad.

709
00:49:53.141 --> 00:49:57.160
I don't know if any people I haven't heard much from,
he had me do a little promo

710
00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:09.660
for Chrysler.
Chrysler burnt.

711
00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:15.460
Yeah.
There's more,
sorry,
how old is age?
He's probably 32.

712
00:50:15.461 --> 00:50:19.660
33.
Did they look amazing?
Yeah.
You keep saying,

713
00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:23.930
you know why I keep saying that in relation to bloated alcoholic bird is what

714
00:50:23.931 --> 00:50:27.410
I'm saying.
No,
of course he looks amazing.
He's a professional athlete.
He's right.

715
00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:27.980
But that's

716
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:32.570
<v 6>clean living,
that's not drinking wine and like being in like,
he,</v>

717
00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:36.440
you know,
started playing sports probably like in,
you know,
elementary school.

718
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.701
Right.

719
00:50:36.701 --> 00:50:41.600
And literally at the 32 year old man has never stopped.

720
00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:46.010
Wow.
That's being like on sports teams.
Like,
yeah.
Just,
uh,
just,

721
00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:49.430
it never ended up,
that's what I'm saying.
Remember in highlights magazine?

722
00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:52.860
Goofus and gallant.
Yeah.
One's doing the wrong thing.
Oh yeah.

723
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:54.650
That's definitely this.
Yeah.
Yeah.

724
00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:58.000
And it's so apparent who's doing the right thing here.
Oh,
it's all,
yeah,
yeah,

725
00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.330
yeah,
yeah.

726
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:03.000
<v 13>That latest blog he did was so damn funny.</v>

727
00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:06.270
There's a moment if even go to is I didn't give it to his youtube page,

728
00:51:06.271 --> 00:51:09.090
Thompson era.
There's a moment where he gets on a scale,

729
00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:12.350
just looks download scammy goes 200.

730
00:51:16.050 --> 00:51:16.883
<v 8>Oh,</v>

731
00:51:22.610 --> 00:51:27.190
<v 6>you guys should watch that blog.
It's great blue boy.
Or is it a shot and edited?</v>

732
00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:30.140
It's on Tom Cigarettes.
Go to Youtube,
uh,

733
00:51:30.141 --> 00:51:32.530
into the Thomson [inaudible] Youtube page.
Hilarious.

734
00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:36.520
<v 13>I said to my therapist,
I go,
if I had a nickel for every time.
I said,</v>

735
00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:40.480
it's a joke guys.
It's a joke now you say it so much that you start going,

736
00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:43.990
is it a joke?
Is this a joke?
Are they my fam?

737
00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:49.410
<v 6>They are,
I think it's loud.
People love them.
Some people was,
look,</v>

738
00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:51.260
I've gotten a little bit of the reversal,

739
00:51:51.261 --> 00:51:56.000
so people are really cutting and like me and you're like,
Jesus.
You know?
Yeah.

740
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:59.960
I've gotten a few of those,
but most people are kind of clever.

741
00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:04.430
This is what comics do.
They shit on each other all the time.
This is part of the,

742
00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:06.550
it's,
it doesn't mean anything.
Not yet

743
00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:11.500
<v 13>called me.
And he goes,
he goes,
hey man,</v>

744
00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:14.880
I gotta do something because I really,
I'm starting to feel bad.
And I go,
don't,

745
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:18.310
I go,
Tom,
don't do any,
I can't have you.
It'll make it a mouse.

746
00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:20.350
I can't have you come out the front door.
What?

747
00:52:20.351 --> 00:52:23.470
I'm going to fight with my mom and an apron and be like,
guys,

748
00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:28.690
split it up or I'm going to have to call your mom,
you know?
And so I go,
Tom,

749
00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:30.640
this has,
I go,
we've got to take this to the end.

750
00:52:30.641 --> 00:52:32.380
And you got to ride this all the way to the fucking ground.

751
00:52:32.770 --> 00:52:35.560
And if it means our careers,
it means our fucking weird.

752
00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:37.420
We're taking this all the way,
right?

753
00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:41.030
<v 6>I did.
I felt bad.
But then there's,
yeah.</v>

754
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:46.160
<v 13>And my only goal right now is to beat Tom,
is to be skinnier than Tom.</v>

755
00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:48.340
<v 6>Oh Wow.
Is that really,</v>

756
00:52:48.341 --> 00:52:50.980
you think he's really gonna how long do you think that's going to last until he

757
00:52:50.981 --> 00:52:53.890
goes on the road again?
Oh Man.
And then he has to drink.
Well,

758
00:52:53.891 --> 00:52:57.260
he never is off the road,
so I'll always stay ahead of them.
Of course.

759
00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:01.180
Cause even like,
of course I'm on the road and you know,
my,
I tell you my regimen,

760
00:53:01.181 --> 00:53:03.610
like I call you,
I go,
Oh,
you know,

761
00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:08.530
I got the show in a few hours going to the gym.
Yeah.
Spend like an hour there,

762
00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:12.760
shower.
It's never going to,
that takes discipline.
Right,
right.
Yeah,

763
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.370
that's a FIFO dreaming.
He also went on punch drunk and uh,

764
00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:21.580
it was really funny with Jason.
Jason Tebow.
Yeah.
And uh,

765
00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:26.100
he had some pretty funny things there.
Every has like a running

766
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.230
<v 13>gags and running jokes.
So I didn't know crab feast.
I did,</v>

767
00:53:29.830 --> 00:53:33.690
I don't know what this was,
but everyone was like,
hey,
please ask Bert,

768
00:53:33.691 --> 00:53:35.820
why are you so fat and that maybe I got 50 of them.

769
00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:45.400
Please ask Bert Way.
He's so fan.
And then Tom was like,
hey man,
I really am sorry.

770
00:53:45.401 --> 00:53:47.500
Like I didn't mean for it to get this big.
And then I was like,

771
00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:50.600
he didn't mean for that to get that bigger you to get that bit

772
00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:56.620
hilarious.
Oh Man.
Yeah.

773
00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:00.010
Just thank God and I go and don't ever forget your fucking fatter than me.

774
00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:04.270
That's the funniest part of the whole thing is Tom is like do 70 to 80.

775
00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:08.230
No Way am not.
I am at least 30 pounds lighter than bull.

776
00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:11.860
No Way.
No Way.
And by the way,
no way.

777
00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:16.810
Even even with those numbers aside,
body composition wise.
Yes,

778
00:54:16.811 --> 00:54:21.310
I agree.
You know Burt's got that hard fat belly.
Yeah.
No,
no,
no,
no.

779
00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:24.490
That's a different balance.
He's got this amazing self esteem.

780
00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:30.700
Unbelievable.
Like the fact that I have friends pulled me aside going,

781
00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:34.960
I don't think you're fat when clearly I fucking am like the second fattest I've

782
00:54:34.961 --> 00:54:35.794
ever been.

783
00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:39.163
<v 8>Nope.</v>

784
00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:44.070
<v 13>But I have friends pulled me aside going,</v>

785
00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:48.750
I don't think you're fat when clearly I fucking am.
Okay.
Um,
yeah.

786
00:54:48.751 --> 00:54:51.240
So there's a couple more things I want to play,

787
00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:54.930
but obviously he's also admitting that he's very right.
Yeah.
Well,

788
00:54:54.931 --> 00:54:57.140
birds never had a problem admitting that he's mad.

789
00:54:57.180 --> 00:55:01.290
I know he's always known it and then ignored whatever steps to take to,

790
00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:05.490
to not be so fat.
Right.
You know,
there's pictures of him.
That's what I shot.

791
00:55:05.491 --> 00:55:09.840
My Special Ed was two 35.
Okay.
And,
but shirtless and oddly enough,

792
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.950
still very overweight.

793
00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:15.810
This is the band is that in the midst of this bird is fat campaign.

794
00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:20.310
He's going to have a special come out where he's shirt.

795
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:24.210
Right.
Oh,
that's going to be great.
I mean there's,
look,

796
00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:29.100
I won't even mention it when that happens,
but it's going to explode.

797
00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:32.550
Yeah.
Like shed a bunch of pallets to be,

798
00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:35.820
his body will never lose weight.

799
00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:38.670
He does not have that kind of body that the weight will just,
that's not trail.

800
00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:39.653
That'll never happen.

801
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:43.860
Whose only goal is to turn into a power lifter and just get bigger.

802
00:55:45.130 --> 00:55:49.730
Okay.
Wow.
Yeah.
Um,
what was I saying before you really interrupts me?
I forgot,

803
00:55:49.731 --> 00:55:53.550
I'm sorry.
I completely forgot my thought.
I'm sorry Tom.

804
00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:59.790
Like we go out to eat and you just watch Benji do.
Oh,
he fucking murderers.

805
00:55:59.791 --> 00:56:02.190
Food Israeli.
Oh yeah,
he's,
he bought her stuff.

806
00:56:02.191 --> 00:56:06.210
I've never heard of like why I use the first person that introduced me to this

807
00:56:06.211 --> 00:56:11.211
is makes me laugh so hard is his impression of me is so far off.

808
00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:16.650
Yeah.
But his commitment to it is amazing.
Squid Pasta.
Oh.

809
00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:18.960
He was like,
we went to his place.
He's like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

810
00:56:18.961 --> 00:56:22.860
You've got to get the ink squid bots a little bit of a little bit shaved.
Uh,
uh,

811
00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:26.380
what are the mushrooms?
Trussell's truffles,

812
00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:30.600
truffle tremor troubles are going to love it all.
And I was like,
really?

813
00:56:30.601 --> 00:56:32.560
He was like,
oh,
it wasn't fucking greatest.
Same.
Get one of those.

814
00:56:32.561 --> 00:56:35.560
You know what we're going to get?
Let me just run it for you.

815
00:56:35.561 --> 00:56:36.970
And then he just orders two things.

816
00:56:36.971 --> 00:56:40.480
He wants him throwing you under the bus by ordering you a bunch of fatty foods

817
00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:42.310
we can keep shitting on.
You know,
this was a while ago.

818
00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:45.910
We went out to every time we've gone out to eat,
he just thought,
I murder booze.

819
00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:46.863
He murders.

820
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:52.170
<v 0>Okay.
Can I,
can I finish that sentence?
He should say I murder booze.</v>

821
00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:55.560
He murders food.
I also murder food.
Yes,

822
00:56:55.620 --> 00:57:00.510
he eats so much sound like it's so much faster than anybody I've ever seen in my

823
00:57:00.511 --> 00:57:04.050
life.
In inhales his plate by the time I'm in one bite.

824
00:57:04.051 --> 00:57:07.410
That's why he thinks other people are murdering food.
Yeah.
Is Gone.
I know.

825
00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:10.890
Remember when we went out with the Chrysler's right before I delivered Ellis?

826
00:57:10.930 --> 00:57:14.790
Yeah.
Literally like a week before.
Yes.
And there's a video of it.

827
00:57:14.791 --> 00:57:18.090
The blog of course.
Go ahead and look at birds like yeah,
he orders.

828
00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:21.360
So five entrees for himself.
Yeah.
Yeah.

829
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:23.310
And then orders all the desserts and he,

830
00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:28.080
it like two bites and then bottles of wine.
Yeah.
Every one of every dessert.

831
00:57:28.081 --> 00:57:30.740
I'm not even exaggerating.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Go ahead and let me look at birds.

832
00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:31.613
He keeps me,

833
00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:34.550
<v 13>he's not a big drinker.
He'll have like a glass of wine,
like a woman.</v>

834
00:57:34.810 --> 00:57:38.510
And then I will drink w I'll go get a bottle and they'll go,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

835
00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:40.160
And then it'd be like my wife,
I give them a glass,

836
00:57:40.310 --> 00:57:43.130
I drink the rest of the bottle and then he orders,
well,
you know what,

837
00:57:43.131 --> 00:57:44.000
we just got a couple deserves.

838
00:57:44.090 --> 00:57:46.640
So we'll just go get two forks and then you're like,
oh God.

839
00:57:46.641 --> 00:57:47.540
And then he just was like,

840
00:57:47.790 --> 00:57:50.750
that'll order three key lime pie who don't want to kill it.

841
00:57:50.751 --> 00:57:55.510
But I don't think calories,
I don't even like sweets.

842
00:57:55.511 --> 00:57:56.540
So he just eats them all.

843
00:57:57.690 --> 00:58:02.540
<v 0>Oh Wow.
God,
look at,
look at birds Vlog.</v>

844
00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:04.390
He's to look at it when he go hard.

845
00:58:04.391 --> 00:58:08.690
When we all went out to dinner when I was like about to pop.
Yeah.
And it'll,

846
00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:13.420
it'll show you let the record show that led to register order five desserts,

847
00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:16.510
burnt Chrysler burned Chrysler ordered five desserts,

848
00:58:16.511 --> 00:58:21.380
five bottles of wine and 10 entrees.
I'm real this guy.
Could we,

849
00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:25.600
I think we should really set up some sort of comedy battle royal.

850
00:58:25.601 --> 00:58:28.510
Like Ari was saying,
no salmon are you are going to fight.
I didn't know that,

851
00:58:28.511 --> 00:58:31.750
but we might be able to get an undercard of you and they're going to box.

852
00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:36.070
What are you talking about?
Why do they have beef?
I think so,
but like,

853
00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:37.570
yeah,
like,

854
00:58:37.570 --> 00:58:41.410
like people don't know that burnt and I don't have any beef and there's no

855
00:58:41.411 --> 00:58:43.520
animosity.
No.
Zero could we,

856
00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:47.770
I think we should really set up some sort of comedy battle royal.

857
00:58:47.771 --> 00:58:50.230
Like Ari was saying,
no salmon,
Ari are going to fight,

858
00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:54.670
but we might be able to get an undercard you and Segura maybe just a half

859
00:58:54.671 --> 00:58:56.810
rounder before you both have fucking heart attack

860
00:58:57.470 --> 00:59:01.390
<v 13>heavier than I am.
But I'd be afraid to,
cause it's like so much foundation there.</v>

861
00:59:01.810 --> 00:59:03.730
You know,
like he's just thick.

862
00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:08.110
Like I'm a light frisky to third 40 he's like,
God,

863
00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:11.320
he's like a solid two side.
Like you can't move that.

864
00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:15.550
He is the mountain and I'm the young gay guy that dances around and almost

865
00:59:15.551 --> 00:59:15.740
winning.

866
00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:19.160
<v 0>Yeah,
he's right though.
Your meat and cheese.</v>

867
00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:22.070
You're solid bear on this year on your way.

868
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:23.770
<v 6>So what about,
what about a j hawk?
Yep.</v>

869
00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:25.760
<v 13>Oh,
he was like,
yeah,
I feel bad.</v>

870
00:59:25.761 --> 00:59:29.830
I'm gonna cut some promos for sucker on about how fat you are.
Really.

871
00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:34.640
I go are you should be
two steps ahead of me in all of this.

872
00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:36.680
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Well he's got time to do.

873
00:59:37.350 --> 00:59:41.840
He's also playing it like a gay man.
I'm going to call off the dogs.
You're good.

874
00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:43.240
And he's cutting promos with aging,

875
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:52.160
allowing burden into a false sense of security.
Huh?
The best.
Yeah.

876
00:59:52.370 --> 00:59:55.540
I had a four egg omelet before I came here to hear it.
Like,
yeah,
I got,

877
00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:56.600
I got two hungry.

878
00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:01.730
<v 6>So anyways,
the bird is fat stuff.
Look,
I don't even push it anymore.</v>

879
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:02.920
I'm just giving you the updates.

880
01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:06.220
The main thing I wanted people to know because I feel like it's not understood

881
01:00:06.221 --> 01:00:07.750
by some,
most people get it,

882
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:12.820
is that that there's no animosity that we are really good friends.

883
01:00:12.821 --> 01:00:14.320
We talk almost every day.

884
01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:19.000
But people sometimes they get comms for people that are like,
whoa man.

885
01:00:19.001 --> 01:00:21.610
Like I can't believe like why are you pulling him?
I'm like,

886
01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:27.670
it's called comedy world.
Yeah.
So anyways,
um,
yeah.
By the way,

887
01:00:27.671 --> 01:00:31.390
we've had a,
you know what?
I gotta take a Piss.
I've had so much water.
Oh,

888
01:00:31.391 --> 01:00:33.810
that's probably because you're not used to drinking so much water.
No,

889
01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:36.130
it's because it's so much more water than you'll ever drink in a week.

890
01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:38.170
And I just had it in like 30 minutes.

891
01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:42.280
Why don't you share the back of your neck too funny.

892
01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:45.700
You Talk Shit and then you went and peed yourself.

893
01:00:46.030 --> 01:00:48.220
Well that's because I thought I should,

894
01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:52.870
but I didn't have to go as badly as you did because you're obviously showboating

895
01:00:52.871 --> 01:00:56.950
and it's not normal for you to drink this much water.
There's totally no color.

896
01:00:56.951 --> 01:00:59.860
Was it?
What do you think?
It's always just the color wall.

897
01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:04.570
Shit I've smelled or as,
you're such a liar.
I can't even believe it.
I swear.

898
01:01:04.571 --> 01:01:08.830
I wish I had smellovision when you and I shower together and you pee and it's

899
01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:09.930
out.
Was Dark

900
01:01:11.730 --> 01:01:16.060
Brown like the coffee and it's smells of cough on Hobos.
Shower,
shower.

901
01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:19.510
It's every time you shower with me,
you're so disgusting.

902
01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:24.280
I swear to God this one wire and you're a liar.
Anyways,

903
01:01:24.850 --> 01:01:29.850
so this morning you made an explosion smoothie.

904
01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:34.510
Well,
I should credit and I regrettably don't remember his name,

905
01:01:34.511 --> 01:01:38.780
the chef at wet nap sack.
Really Nice Guy.
He knows you.
He remembered you.
Oh yeah.

906
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:40.550
He's real friendly and he's like,

907
01:01:41.050 --> 01:01:44.240
there's only a few clubs were like the chef will come in the green room.

908
01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:48.240
Be like anything you want.
That's so nice.
So nice healthy eater.

909
01:01:48.241 --> 01:01:52.600
I'm like burnt Chrysler.
You probably were like,
feel so welcoming.

910
01:01:52.601 --> 01:01:54.300
And so you know,
there's,

911
01:01:54.370 --> 01:01:58.420
there's a few kitchens like that first night I ordered this chicken dish was

912
01:01:58.421 --> 01:01:58.871
great.

913
01:01:58.871 --> 01:02:02.510
And then actually a lot of people were even tweeting me that there they were

914
01:02:02.511 --> 01:02:02.840
like,

915
01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.900
we actually have it working at a club where the food is good cause it's nice,

916
01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:10.240
really good food there.
Anyways.
Then somebody else mentioned it,
they're like,

917
01:02:10.270 --> 01:02:12.390
oh if you had one of those smoothies and I didn't know what they meant.

918
01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.800
I thought they were talking about something sweet,
you know,

919
01:02:14.801 --> 01:02:16.000
like what kind of smoothie?

920
01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:19.710
Oh he just throws a bunch of fruits and vegetables and I go,
oh I'll try that.

921
01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:23.730
Because I had just literally on the road I tried to maintain this thing where I

922
01:02:23.731 --> 01:02:27.920
go work out shower show.
Right.
You know,
because if you,

923
01:02:27.921 --> 01:02:32.010
if you do it in that order,
it's a,
it's a good time of day.
Do you started at?

924
01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:37.440
Well,
let's say I have a seven o'clock show,
I will try to work out,
uh,

925
01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:42.480
between four 45.
I'll try,
I'll try to start in the gym between four 45 and five.

926
01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:46.560
That way you have like a good,
however long you want to work out,
30 40,

927
01:02:46.561 --> 01:02:50.820
60 minutes and then you're not rushed.
So you,
you go back to your room,

928
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:53.580
you take a shower,
you can do,
you don't have to rush there.

929
01:02:53.581 --> 01:02:57.650
She knew casually before shows anymore.
That's old.
No.

930
01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:02.780
What happens is those workouts give you that energy boost that cause a lot of

931
01:03:03.391 --> 01:03:07.020
times if you drag,
you feel lethargic on the road.
Yeah.
But if you go to,

932
01:03:07.021 --> 01:03:10.530
if you do your workout right before take your shower,
you get dressed,

933
01:03:10.531 --> 01:03:14.880
you kind of feel like,
oh,
I'm really like awake right now.
Alive.
Yes.

934
01:03:14.881 --> 01:03:18.030
Alive and energized.
And then you arrive at the show.

935
01:03:18.031 --> 01:03:21.780
I also like to get picked up very late.
Yeah.
So that I can arrive.

936
01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:25.230
I don't want to wait at the,
at the nine years.
So I do that,

937
01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:28.470
I arrive and then at showtime and it feels great.
Um,

938
01:03:28.650 --> 01:03:32.220
but the only thing that becomes kind of hairy then is if you had worked out,

939
01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:35.130
you're going to go to your show,
you get hungry,

940
01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:39.060
you don't want to eat a lot of times comedy club food.
So this option,

941
01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:42.690
the smoothie,
I was like,
this is excellent.
Anyways,
I asked him what he,
what he,

942
01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:47.940
how he makes it and he tells me,
you know,
cucumbers,
lime juice.
Uh,
he goes,

943
01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:51.090
you don't have that.
Maybe if you don't have the cucumber,

944
01:03:51.091 --> 01:03:55.590
you use Kale and avocado apples and just,
it's just a mix.

945
01:03:55.591 --> 01:03:58.770
Mash of like of fruits and vegetables.
Right.

946
01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:01.410
So I just asked you to pick it up while I was gone.

947
01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:06.930
I fired it up this morning for you.
And
right away,

948
01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:10.470
first of all,
I did the,
um,
cause it was the first time making it,

949
01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:13.140
I did the taste test.
I go,
let me see what it tastes like.

950
01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:18.710
After two sips of taste test I got,
I gotta take a shit that was two sips.

951
01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:24.000
Yeah.
Explosion came back,
uh,

952
01:04:24.001 --> 01:04:26.640
added a little soy milk water.
We didn't have ice,

953
01:04:26.641 --> 01:04:31.040
so to make a call to put cold water in there.
And then,
um,
gave you,

954
01:04:31.041 --> 01:04:33.410
you had about what,
three quarters of it?
I saw you as a little bit,

955
01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:38.770
<v 0>you gave me a nice healthy tall glass and here I am like,</v>

956
01:04:39.381 --> 01:04:43.460
yeah,
this,
this tastes great.
It's going down super easy.
I'm feeding.

957
01:04:43.461 --> 01:04:47.540
The kid were laughing and then we take Ellis up for his nap,

958
01:04:47.810 --> 01:04:51.300
his morning nap.
And I'm like,
well why don't you put them down?
I,

959
01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:54.620
my stomach hurts a little bit and I had already taken my morning shit.

960
01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:57.920
I drink my coffee in the morning,
I shit.
And then she usually it for the day.

961
01:04:57.921 --> 01:05:02.690
I don't,
we'll shit anymore.
But I felt a rumbling and I was like,

962
01:05:02.691 --> 01:05:06.360
I gotta go.
I gotta go.
You never do two in the morning?
Yeah.

963
01:05:06.890 --> 01:05:11.060
And the pain,
the cramping,

964
01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:15.380
I was doubled over and I was like whole Mike.
God,
it was a six,

965
01:05:15.381 --> 01:05:19.810
a hot six.
Yeah.
But now I just shower immediately.
And by the way,

966
01:05:19.811 --> 01:05:23.930
the day it wasn't enough.
It was back to shit to shower because of this.

967
01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:25.180
Wow.

968
01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:30.220
Now did you discover that because you use per day wiped and then you're like

969
01:05:30.221 --> 01:05:34.570
this isn't enough.
Yeah,
so I a date it.
I read brainstorming sprints,

970
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:35.350
brainstorm insurance.

971
01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:39.880
I left it extra long and I went to wipe and there was still brown on the paper.

972
01:05:39.881 --> 01:05:42.970
Ah.
And I go,
it's time for old school.

973
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.890
What a story now do you think now you don't think obviously that what I made

974
01:05:47.891 --> 01:05:52.780
was,
was bad.
What do you think is,
it's just so intense.
It's not bad.
What did it,

975
01:05:52.781 --> 01:05:57.781
what it is is you've got your Kale and then you put like 10 lines in lime juice

976
01:05:58.091 --> 01:06:01.000
alone will make me shit apples.

977
01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:04.930
I saw you throw in apples I saw is high,
high,

978
01:06:04.931 --> 01:06:09.750
high fibrous and you need something like a banana to pull it together cause

979
01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:13.120
there's nothing on yogurt or something to pull it because it's all like high

980
01:06:13.121 --> 01:06:17.380
fiber,
high acidic,
orange.
You had orange in there too.

981
01:06:17.381 --> 01:06:22.160
So I mean eating one orange alone will make me shit dynamite like already.
Yeah,

982
01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:26.440
it's gotta be tempered jeans.
You hear me?
How should I have done?
Okay.

983
01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:31.390
Here's what I would do if I were you.
Half a banana,
a little bit of Yogurt,

984
01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:36.830
like Greek yogurt.
You do,
you're a like a peach.
Maybe some stores,

985
01:06:36.831 --> 01:06:38.980
some berries,
blueberries,

986
01:06:38.981 --> 01:06:43.750
strawberry and maybe some Kale and cucumber.

987
01:06:43.751 --> 01:06:48.340
And that's it.
You can't do all acidic fibrous.
I mean,

988
01:06:48.341 --> 01:06:51.880
sorry,
we what?
Okay,
I'll,
I'll,
uh,
I'll tone it down.

989
01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:56.470
I'll go pick up the banana is going to help because the banana binds it.

990
01:06:56.620 --> 01:07:01.540
You know what I'm saying?
Okay.
There's a lot that was really intense.

991
01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:05.500
I think I lost weight though.
Today's my weigh in day on weight watchers.

992
01:07:05.501 --> 01:07:10.000
So you'll look great.
I do,
you know why discipline,

993
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:15.310
I don't need anymore.
I just stopped eating
at night.
I don't eat at night.

994
01:07:15.311 --> 01:07:19.900
I stopped eating by five o'clock.
I try not to eat.
I try not to drink a lot too,

995
01:07:20.130 --> 01:07:22.060
but I got to say it was different,
you know,
it was,

996
01:07:22.070 --> 01:07:27.070
it was still a morning sort of explosion,
but it was,
it was a healthier one.

997
01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:31.750
I felt good.
When are you going to see the doctor for this IBS?
This is week.
Yeah.

998
01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:36.040
Oh Shit.
I wish we could live tweet the event.
Maybe blue.

999
01:07:36.830 --> 01:07:41.290
Can I come with you and live tweet?
What is it Tommy?

1000
01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:44.590
Are you afraid you missed your appointment?
I don't want to miss my appointment.

1001
01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:48.940
Is it today or tomorrow?
It's Thursday.
Okay.

1002
01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:53.140
Yeah.
What are you looking at?
What?
Nothing.
I'm just thinking about it.

1003
01:07:53.141 --> 01:07:56.710
That's all you are.
You're excited to go to the doctor for your IBS.
Of course.

1004
01:07:57.110 --> 01:08:01.030
Are they going to make you shit?
They're like we have to bring in a stool sample.

1005
01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:05.470
Um,
like with Theo and we have to take dogs.
Might be,

1006
01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:11.060
he might be getting to know you kind of sit down.
Oh right.

1007
01:08:11.070 --> 01:08:12.380
Tell him all the brown stores.

1008
01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:15.890
What did he goes away about what you're going through.
And I go,

1009
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:18.060
could you just download a few episodes of your mind?

1010
01:08:20.810 --> 01:08:21.950
Can I tell you something though?

1011
01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:26.240
You need to start making I shit diary and a diet diary so this guy can have a

1012
01:08:26.241 --> 01:08:31.160
good picture.
Okay.
Cause you have,
and I don't mean this in a mean way,

1013
01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:34.910
kind of a skewed memory about what happens to you because you don't really put

1014
01:08:34.911 --> 01:08:38.090
cause and effect together very well.
The,
you're saying that like I'm a,

1015
01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:42.930
a patient who maybe doesn't have all his yes.

1016
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:43.850
Brain cells working.

1017
01:08:43.851 --> 01:08:46.790
Cause you do the same thing over and over and then you get diarrhea.

1018
01:08:46.791 --> 01:08:50.420
And I have to be like,
Babe,
you can't have fried food.
It makes you shit.

1019
01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:51.513
<v 14>Hmm.</v>

1020
01:08:56.210 --> 01:09:00.020
<v 0>You're such a show off.
You're such a show off right now.</v>

1021
01:09:00.021 --> 01:09:03.050
You're not even that thirsty.
You're just doing this for the cameras.

1022
01:09:03.290 --> 01:09:07.490
They can't even see the truth.
This is such fucking bullshit.

1023
01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:09.373
Are you done?

1024
01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.013
<v 14>That's one step.</v>

1025
01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:18.300
<v 0>But you do that like twice a day,</v>

1026
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:22.200
but you don't understand what it is to be the water champion.

1027
01:09:24.210 --> 01:09:28.600
I consume so much water.
Okay.
Can we talk about something else?
Sure.

1028
01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:32.400
Um,
we got,
uh,

1029
01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:36.850
a request on Youtube from,

1030
01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:40.750
Oh my,
are you ready?
Yes.
Nick Hawk.

1031
01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:46.350
She wanted to get us on the copyright infringement and say that we're playing a

1032
01:09:46.631 --> 01:09:50.140
song as it,
it should be taken down.
Isn't that amazing.
He didn't like that.

1033
01:09:50.141 --> 01:09:54.520
We weren't talking about his music.
His music.

1034
01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:59.590
Yeah.
It was very upset.
And guess what?
We fought the law and we won.

1035
01:09:59.830 --> 01:10:01.720
Well,
we didn't really fight it.
No,
he didn't.

1036
01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:05.870
So we just didn't get taken down because there's no infringement.
Yeah.

1037
01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:06.760
We didn't infringe.

1038
01:10:06.761 --> 01:10:11.761
We explored and discussed it and gave him credit for his horrible,

1039
01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:15.280
horrible music.
Yeah.
I mean,

1040
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:21.640
he actually filed the copyright claim.
This is what they wrote back to us.

1041
01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:24.050
If it was a few episodes ago,
where right.

1042
01:10:24.490 --> 01:10:28.450
We played some of his songs.
Um,

1043
01:10:30.250 --> 01:10:35.220
let me,
uh,
let's play them again just for old time's sake.
Well,

1044
01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:38.080
I,
cause I feel like they're all so terrible,

1045
01:10:38.081 --> 01:10:42.790
but then what's the most terrible Nick Kok Song?
I don't know.
Yeah.
Well,

1046
01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:45.850
you know.
Yeah.
What's the most unpleasant STD?

1047
01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:49.450
They're all pretty bad dude.
Yeah,
I bet he was.

1048
01:10:49.451 --> 01:10:52.600
What's the worst Steven Seagal movie?
They're all pretty terrible,

1049
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.110
but that's what you're asking when you're asking what's the worst?
Nick hawks,

1050
01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:59.920
his,
his album is really,
really atrocious.
So

1051
01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:04.470
here is a,
but it's the best worst.

1052
01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:12.220
So it is the best.
Worst though,

1053
01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:13.873
by the way,

1054
01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:17.880
<v 7>a lot of people didn't go to it.
They didn't really try it out.
And then,
I mean,</v>

1055
01:11:17.881 --> 01:11:20.820
it says here's the comments under it.
Hey,

1056
01:11:20.821 --> 01:11:23.900
Mommy's checking in high and tight here.
Um,

1057
01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:28.940
you should stick to fucking old white women really over it looks like he hasn't

1058
01:11:29.311 --> 01:11:33.240
found the come low and Louis no common.
These balls

1059
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:38.550
thought it was pretty good.
High and tight.
Just like my jeans got a fan.
Okay.

1060
01:11:39.150 --> 01:11:41.160
We're not just discouraging people from becoming a fan.

1061
01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:44.913
<v 9>Breaking a sweat.</v>

1062
01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:52.123
<v 7>So</v>

1063
01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:57.823
<v 9>gets,</v>

1064
01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:02.060
what's the

1065
01:12:07.170 --> 01:12:08.680
catch up?
I take off like a jet.

1066
01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:12.910
<v 7>I mean,
yeah,
it sounds he's just behind Kendrick Lamar.</v>

1067
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:15.220
They were both very talented.
Um,

1068
01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:22.300
is that,
is that your favorite?
That's my favorite song is yes,

1069
01:12:22.450 --> 01:12:26.500
it is.
Okay.
My favorite intentionally awesome song.

1070
01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:31.150
Uh,
yeah,
there's a bunch of,
what else can read me?
The titles I've forgotten,

1071
01:12:31.151 --> 01:12:33.040
which is my favorite.
He's got one that's called,

1072
01:12:33.041 --> 01:12:35.590
everybody's got a little country in him.
I didn't know that.

1073
01:12:35.591 --> 01:12:38.920
Sounds like a new jam.
Let's give it a listen.
Maybe it's better.

1074
01:12:41.770 --> 01:12:42.410
<v 1>I thought it was</v>

1075
01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:43.243
<v 7>a rapper.</v>

1076
01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:50.380
<v 1>No matter where you,
no matter what.</v>

1077
01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:54.810
This is Nick Hodge from the Kong.

1078
01:12:56.310 --> 01:13:00.750
<v 7>Great.
That's actually really good,
nick.
Yeah,
stick to country.
That's the thing.</v>

1079
01:13:00.751 --> 01:13:05.310
You're just in the wrong lane.
Yeah.
Your accidental song.
It's good.

1080
01:13:06.130 --> 01:13:10.520
<v 1>Good.
I like this a lot better.
There's a little cottage.</v>

1081
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:18.860
<v 7>Hey,
this is actually good.
Good job.
Wow.
Job.
Here's another one called,
yeah,</v>

1082
01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:23.340
forget the rabbit.
I mean that guy,
Vince.

1083
01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:26.810
No issue on the rap battle.
We saw that episode on Juggalos and look,

1084
01:13:26.850 --> 01:13:31.050
there's nothing wrong with saying this isn't my genre,
this isn't my lane.

1085
01:13:31.051 --> 01:13:33.480
Pick something you're good at and here's a great country,

1086
01:13:38.890 --> 01:13:39.900
<v 9>Dan.
You know,</v>

1087
01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.540
I'm happy in,

1088
01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:05.130
<v 7>yeah,
I still like breaking a sweat.</v>

1089
01:14:05.131 --> 01:14:09.500
The vest I d I think that's still my favorite worst,
best,

1090
01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.500
worst song of Nick Hodge.
He's got a music video.

1091
01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:18.040
I like how your eyes just looked at the screen,
please.
Okay,
please.

1092
01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:23.920
So there's a [inaudible] thank I've been waiting for a video.

1093
01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:27.420
<v 9>Yeah.
Didn't know that he had a good Yo.</v>

1094
01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:29.663
Oh Shit

1095
01:14:37.650 --> 01:14:39.900
I've ever seen in my life.
I don't.
You describe it.

1096
01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:40.733
<v 7>What's going on for it?</v>

1097
01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:46.080
I don't think I can't describe it without being embarrassed.
Can you?
Yeah,

1098
01:14:46.081 --> 01:14:49.170
it's called we fight.
Um,
and it begins by him

1099
01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:53.760
walking and it looked like a in the desert.
What?

1100
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:58.530
Twirling a sword or some fighting instrument in a,

1101
01:14:58.531 --> 01:15:01.940
in a manner that a martial arts expert would.
Right.

1102
01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:05.310
And now he's walking around a fire shirtless and shirtless.

1103
01:15:05.311 --> 01:15:08.610
This is very to Sigale by them.
I'm predicting he ends up fighting himself.

1104
01:15:08.730 --> 01:15:09.580
That's what we're going to see.

1105
01:15:10.010 --> 01:15:13.970
That there's going to be two people and that they're both,
yeah,

1106
01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:16.770
it's always about him,
right?
Yeah.

1107
01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:25.823
<v 9>Bye.</v>

1108
01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:28.630
<v 7>Why do you shoot it on an iPhone?</v>

1109
01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:33.790
You can tell right away that like the video quality city.
God Damn it man.
I know.

1110
01:15:33.791 --> 01:15:37.310
At least rent a decent fucking camera.
Your fucking money on it.

1111
01:15:37.530 --> 01:15:38.363
<v 9>Gotcha.</v>

1112
01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:42.070
<v 7>Tore always and just use some of that whole money.</v>

1113
01:15:46.890 --> 01:15:50.530
None.
It's too dark.
You can't even see ya.
You gotta hire a grip.

1114
01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:55.480
You need a lighting.
Yeah.
Come on Bro.
What are you fucking knew the sound,

1115
01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:59.080
the song sound very similar like one with the exception of the country song.

1116
01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:01.600
And it also sounds like the last song.
Okay,

1117
01:16:01.710 --> 01:16:03.430
<v 9>well I'm done.
I'm too distracted.</v>

1118
01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:17.890
<v 7>Isn't a Geeky,
and he's chopping,
you know,</v>

1119
01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:22.920
different blue posturing and now he's in a jacket and he's saying we fight.
Yeah.

1120
01:16:23.010 --> 01:16:23.970
So

1121
01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:32.760
did he give so much ink on that one arm,
shoulder,
chest,

1122
01:16:32.761 --> 01:16:37.500
and shorten shoulder that it's just all black.
Now does Steven Seagal make music?

1123
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:42.430
Yes.
Oh,
the harmonica.
Or was that Burrito plays the blues.
Right.

1124
01:16:42.970 --> 01:16:47.910
And,
and,
and he sings,
right?
Steven does like,
is it good?
Like is he,

1125
01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:52.110
is he okay?
Is it Steven Seagal better at singing the Nick Hawkins at scene?
Yes,

1126
01:16:53.610 --> 01:16:54.443
very much.

1127
01:16:56.220 --> 01:17:00.970
<v 9>Bye.
We fight my which way and carry too much weight and keeping it,</v>

1128
01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:01.813
keeping noxious.

1129
01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:06.340
<v 7>Let's just see if he embarrassed.
I want to see if he fight some.
Okay.</v>

1130
01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:10.040
How's it going to fight?
This he doing is working out here going,
of course.

1131
01:17:10.041 --> 01:17:14.480
That's what he does.
He works out.
He twirls the sword.
Oh Shit.

1132
01:17:14.481 --> 01:17:19.280
Now he's on a rock and he's,
he's on a rock.
Okay.

1133
01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:23.160
There you go.
Oh,
well how much are you,
and it's an iPhone shooting.

1134
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:28.550
He's on a rock.
He's spreading his wings.

1135
01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:32.040
Uh,
what is happening?
I'm so super,

1136
01:17:32.050 --> 01:17:35.990
he has the behavior of somebody really into coke,
but I don't think he does it.

1137
01:17:36.330 --> 01:17:39.200
You know,
there's a lot of coke had behavior.
I know,
I know.

1138
01:17:39.690 --> 01:17:43.670
I know you're talking about like create,
Sean was Kinda like this.
Oh yeah.

1139
01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:47.370
We'll just twirling.
He never fights anybody.
He just twirls wrong.
He,

1140
01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:52.510
he did well.
It's kind of 94,000 views.
I was a lot of use.

1141
01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:57.260
Good.
Nick.
Um,
let's see.
They released,
it was released

1142
01:17:59.390 --> 01:18:03.830
February.
Wow.
Good for him.
This song is honestly so cringe worthy.

1143
01:18:07.130 --> 01:18:11.640
Read some other reviews.
Let me see.
You did it again.
Great job.
Uh Huh.

1144
01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:16.100
Uh,
it's like rich Vos,
his son decided to smoke weed and not give a care.

1145
01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:23.840
Needs more Skype punches all inner game on that.
Yeah.

1146
01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:26.870
He does need a crazy low cause to help him.
Great job.

1147
01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:29.150
I like the constant changing of the backgrounds.

1148
01:18:33.130 --> 01:18:37.810
Oof.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Extremely passionate on many levels.
Oh,

1149
01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:41.260
that's good.
That's positive.
That is accurate.
Love it.
And you were smoking hot.

1150
01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:44.200
There you go.
Okay.
Love it.
Amazing.

1151
01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:49.270
Can't wait to jam out to this feeling it.
I love your voice.

1152
01:18:49.690 --> 01:18:52.780
You're definitely more than just a pretty face.
Is this a guy?

1153
01:18:52.781 --> 01:18:56.890
An older man that's,
that's a woman fierce.
That's,

1154
01:18:56.920 --> 01:19:00.670
that's how I would best describe it.
You have to,
yeah.
Fierce.
We fight.

1155
01:19:00.671 --> 01:19:04.960
I'm digging it.
Great job.
You got a lot of love.
God.
Dagon maybe we're wrong.

1156
01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:09.520
Maybe this,
uh,
you know,
this could be a huge hit.
Could be,
man.
I don't know.

1157
01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:12.790
It hasn't been up that long.
You've got about a hundred thousand of years.
Yeah.

1158
01:19:12.791 --> 01:19:17.770
A lot of it.
So maybe,
maybe I'm not the music aficionado.
I thought I was.
Yeah,

1159
01:19:17.771 --> 01:19:22.450
you're always,
I mean,
to be fair,
I've never said that.

1160
01:19:22.451 --> 01:19:25.570
I understand music that well,
but Christina definitely does.

1161
01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:30.190
Definitely get on her.
Sure.
He hit on me.
Yeah.
If,
like I'm saying,

1162
01:19:30.191 --> 01:19:34.330
if you're mad no,
no.
At,
at Tom Cigarette,

1163
01:19:34.590 --> 01:19:38.680
let him know how you feel.
Um,

1166
01:19:46.110 --> 01:19:49.630

Yeah.
Well,

1167
01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:53.350
it's a price you pay for greatness.

1169
01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:58.060
Is there any actually that giving you more attention,
which is a good thing.

1170

but he has a new appearance.
Okay.

1181
01:20:37.290 --> 01:20:42.270
And I think he wanted to Trump his last appearance because his new,

1182
01:20:42.271 --> 01:20:46.640
you know what I'm saying?
Count is out of control.
Is Dj Khaled,

01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:16.760
a guy's getting interviewed in the studio.

I would say per time,

1197
01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:42.010
this might be the champion in terms like he did

1198

<v 6>breakfast club,
[inaudible] morning radio show in New York.

Yeah.
The high level high volume here,
high volt,

1204
01:22:02.611 --> 01:22:05.820
this is a contender for the most,
you know what I'm saying,

1205
01:22:05.821 --> 01:22:10.470
is in the shortest amount of time I would say yeah.
Uh hmm.

Quantity in time.

you'll never actually really when I know what I'm saying,

1213

1238
01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.540

1239
01:24:19.570 --> 01:24:24.520
especially on the television to on the camel,
that this is a huge platform for,

1240
01:24:24.521 --> 01:24:26.350
you know what I'm saying?
It is outrageous.

1241
01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:29.500
This isn't just like some radio shows off fear though.
This is my,

1242
01:24:29.530 --> 01:24:32.110
this is my favorite one stuff here.
Okay.
Check it out.

1243
01:24:32.111 --> 01:24:33.970
And you know what I'm saying?
It's a fear.
You know what I'm saying?

1244
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:37.180
You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?

1245
01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:42.580
Shout out to my main boss,
man.
You know,
he was good.

1246
01:24:43.150 --> 01:24:44.670

1248
01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:51.860
who is that?

1249
01:24:54.250 --> 01:24:56.230
There's a few of those though.
It's hard to,

1250
01:24:56.860 --> 01:25:01.260
<v 7>he talks about holding in his,
uh,

Yeah.
Oh,

He died a couple weeks ago.
Yeah.
Oh No.

1254
01:25:17.841 --> 01:25:22.510
Half 42.
How did he die?
Heart attack?
I think so.
Yeah.
Oh Damn.

1255
01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:26.060
And I didn't know that.
Yeah,
I'm super bombed.

1256
01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:31.810
I go super funny.
Wow.
Yeah.
42.
Yeah.

1257
01:25:31.811 --> 01:25:35.750
That's what sucks about being 40 now is like I could die.
Yeah.

1258
01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:39.600
I mean most people don't,
but now motherfuckers are dying and we're already,

1259
01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:41.500
you know what I mean?
It happened then people were like,
yeah,

1260
01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:45.360
that's just the way it goes.
Yeah.
And now if I die,
it's like not a big,

1261
01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:48.110
do you know what I'm saying?
Yeah,
yeah.
People give it a go.

1262
01:25:48.111 --> 01:25:51.900
I don't know what you're saying.
What does it mean?
Right,
right.

1263
01:25:54.490 --> 01:25:57.570
Know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?

1264
01:25:58.140 --> 01:26:03.140
So a brand new case of foreign accent syndrome has come about.

1265
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:06.130
My favorite disease,
um,

1266
01:26:06.890 --> 01:26:09.620
it's one of the Oh gee topics of our show.

1267
01:26:09.621 --> 01:26:11.740
And you may remember the first time we ever

1268
01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:13.013
<v 16>later</v>

1269
01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:19.020
<v 7>Brianna,</v>

1270
01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:24.020
that is a British woman who woke up one day with foreign accent syndrome and now

1271
01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:31.260
it is attacking a woman in Texas.

1272
01:26:32.490 --> 01:26:37.020
You know what accident she woke up with jeans?
What?
British.

1273
01:26:37.650 --> 01:26:39.330
Oh,
cool.
Yeah,
let's hear it.

1274
01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:41.590
<v 17>Well,
people who've met me before,</v>

1275
01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:46.570
they shot first and then most people say,
oh,
I love it.

1276
01:26:47.110 --> 01:26:50.830
But for me it's a lot different.
Wow.
Listening to this mother,

1277
01:26:50.831 --> 01:26:53.160
you think she was from London but uh,

1278
01:26:53.290 --> 01:26:55.130
she was actually born and raised right here in Texas.

1279
01:26:55.190 --> 01:27:00.110
<v 16>Strange but true.
And it's an extremely rare case called foreign accent syndrome.</v>

1280
01:27:00.111 --> 01:27:03.890
But doctor say it actually happens and now actually happened to try to get her

1281
01:27:03.891 --> 01:27:04.724
normal speech.

1282
01:27:04.870 --> 01:27:09.310
<v 7>There's like 15 cases worldwide report is so rare.</v>

1283
01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:14.410
It's like a double pipe class for language as paper logs.

1284
01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:18.490
<v 17>Oh,
not from England.
Sorry.
He is 100% Texas painful.</v>

1285
01:27:18.491 --> 01:27:21.350
Who Don't know me that,
hey,
where are you from?

1286
01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:27.940
Oh wait,
where's that?
I'm like,
Oh,
you talk like that.

1287
01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:30.970
So that's when the whole story comes up.

1288
01:27:31.610 --> 01:27:34.880
<v 7>I don't buy this.
Do you buy this?
There was the one that was fake.</v>

1289
01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:38.150
Remember the fake one that was clearly fake?
We played it a long time ago.

1290
01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:41.000
This lady claimed that she had it and then she walked,

1291
01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:44.390
the camera came and he saw her walking in the parking lot.

1292
01:27:45.770 --> 01:27:49.820
They stopped her talk to her and then when she walked away she walked sideways.

1293
01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:52.320
Like she was doing a little bit of a,

1294
01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:55.250
an app cause she said it was a whole neurological thing.

1295
01:27:55.251 --> 01:27:58.380
And I tend to think that these people need attention.

1296
01:27:58.710 --> 01:28:03.530
It might just be bored and wants some attention.
But it does happen though,
right?

1297
01:28:03.531 --> 01:28:07.190
I mean,
I don't know.
Oh,
you're saying you don't believe it at all?
I don't know.

1298
01:28:07.191 --> 01:28:10.940
The,
the one,
the one lady who and four year now that one,

1299
01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:15.050
she legitimately was a bit tortured by it.
She seemed towards me.
She was like,

1300
01:28:15.051 --> 01:28:17.700
I just want,
I want to talk the way I used tall,
tall.

1301
01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:23.630
She was like that.
She's like,
she really was.
She was like,
yeah,

1302
01:28:24.150 --> 01:28:28.370
I'll watch the way I use that to talk them or she talking like that.

1303
01:28:32.030 --> 01:28:36.620
That's how she said it.
She said she did.
So you do it.

1304
01:28:36.650 --> 01:28:39.290
You're the master of accents.
Do her doing the accent.

1305
01:28:40.630 --> 01:28:45.530
<v 16>I challis voice in the conversation and combine nearly for Ya know,</v>

1306
01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:46.373
for,
you know,

1307
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:52.430
<v 17>mom is probably the one word I noticed right away on kitten.</v>

1308
01:28:53.150 --> 01:28:57.200
They think I'm talking about a baby cat and I'm not.
I'm saying I'm just kidding.

1309
01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:59.240
But it's kidding.
I'm just kidding.

1310
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:02.040
<v 7>But how would she have mastered the</v>

1311
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:06.650
<v 6>accent?
I mean she's,
she's watching TV,
man,
she list into your shop.</v>

1312
01:29:06.670 --> 01:29:11.610
But she's like,
you know,
fucking lady from,
I don't know man,

1313
01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:15.780
the man,
because they played,
remember when they played the reaction?

1314
01:29:15.781 --> 01:29:19.560
I was the British ladies answering machine.
Are they going to judge?

1315
01:29:19.561 --> 01:29:23.070
And they played her before she had the foreign accent syndrome and she was

1316
01:29:23.071 --> 01:29:25.800
really sad when she hurt herself.
She was like,

1317
01:29:25.890 --> 01:29:28.530
Oh I wish I could talk at this away again.

1318
01:29:30.510 --> 01:29:34.440
She did.
I remember,
I remember he was like,
Oh,

1319
01:29:34.450 --> 01:29:39.320
if we shot could talk like a decent yes.
Talk on like,

1320
01:29:39.321 --> 01:29:43.680
Oh this are now.
Yup.
This one,

1321
01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:46.170
I don't believe anybody that has clear braces to you.

1322
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:51.420
That's what the other lady was talking.
Yeah.

1323
01:29:51.421 --> 01:29:55.500
I don't like it when people do the clear,
but what I do,
the Invisalign,
you know,

1324
01:29:55.501 --> 01:29:57.770
people can still see him,
but then you don't have,
you know,

1325
01:29:57.780 --> 01:30:02.160
nerdy ass clear braces,
gold school man get,
get the metal.

1326
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:06.450
Do you think the clear braces are just worse than the old school metal ones?

1327
01:30:07.450 --> 01:30:10.560
Um,
I dunno,
cause you're not fooling anybody.

1328
01:30:10.561 --> 01:30:13.560
We still know that you have the brace from a distance,

1329
01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:16.770
but actually their mouth's still kind of,
that's what I'm saying.

1330
01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:18.960
You can still tell that's a piece so badly again.

1331
01:30:21.930 --> 01:30:23.520
Well,
well your honor,

1332
01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:27.660
could that be because like his show boating around with a lot of drinking

1333
01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:31.050
because she had not accustomed to drank in this much.

1334
01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:32.790
Are they going to think I'm lying?

1335
01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:37.140
Are they going to even understand how I'm speaking?
It doesn't sound,

1336
01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:39.120
here's the thing though.
A lot of these people,

1337
01:30:39.121 --> 01:30:42.600
I think the fakies sometimes you see it,
you hear it dip,
you know,

1338
01:30:42.690 --> 01:30:44.280
like it doesn't,
it doesn't sound like it's,

1339
01:30:44.281 --> 01:30:49.080
they're all Chinese accent lady had it one time.
Her,

1340
01:30:49.081 --> 01:30:50.610
she's like,
are they going to think I'm lying?

1341
01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:56.080
It doesn't sound 100% she's speaking like cockney she's not think I'm lying.

1342
01:30:56.370 --> 01:31:00.840
Like she kind of does like a lower class.
Oh Wow.
Interesting.

1343
01:31:00.841 --> 01:31:04.500
Winner of the poll.
Let everybody see that he can't hold his water.

1344
01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:08.610
We'll look at which I've drank because it's not accustomed for you if you drank

1345
01:31:08.611 --> 01:31:11.320
this much water.
You have to,
Pete,
what'd you say?

1346
01:31:11.321 --> 01:31:14.850
No one's a of meaning you because why?

1347
01:31:14.851 --> 01:31:16.710
This is an out of the norm for you know,

1348
01:31:16.711 --> 01:31:19.560
it doesn't matter or you drink the every day.
Wait a minute.

1349
01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:21.570
You don't drink this much every day,
so I do,

1350
01:31:21.630 --> 01:31:24.570
and your body still has to get rid of it,
but if he drank this much every day,

1351
01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:26.550
we never have to break twice for you to pay.

1352
01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:31.290
I'm drinking more this episode at this moment,
but that doesn't mean why.

1353
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:33.150
Why are you drinking more this episode?

1354
01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:38.250
Why letting them know what I normally do after the show?
During the show?
Okay,

1355
01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:42.030
sure.
That's the only difference.
Go ahead and urinate again.
Oh Man,

1356
01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:45.750
who's exclusive now.
As soon as he was super abusive

1357
01:31:48.290 --> 01:31:49.890
and I'm like,
I turned her just then.

1358
01:31:50.850 --> 01:31:55.540
Now here's the part that I feel like I feel like you just don't get it.
No,

1359
01:31:55.650 --> 01:31:59.230
you don't get it.
No,
you don't.
Let me explain.
You're like,
oh,

1360
01:31:59.410 --> 01:32:00.500
you're not used to it.

1361
01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:03.600
<v 0>That's why you picked that are not used to drinking as much water.</v>

1362
01:32:04.570 --> 01:32:07.870
<v 6>That's not true.
How has that been finished and not true?</v>

1363
01:32:08.290 --> 01:32:11.950
I'll explain it to you cause you don't get it.
You don't get a lot,
but

1364
01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:19.600
any lievable,
any body that consumes as much water,

1365
01:32:19.601 --> 01:32:23.410
whether it be the first time they ever did it or they do it every day,

1366
01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:26.330
your body has to get rid of the flu.
Yeah,

1367
01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:30.490
so you're saying like anybody who just down's half a gallon and an hour's not

1368
01:32:30.491 --> 01:32:35.020
like I'm used to it so it doesn't have to come out.
Not just that.
No,
not true.

1369
01:32:35.050 --> 01:32:35.570
You don't get it.

1370
01:32:35.570 --> 01:32:37.460
<v 0>You don't get it because you don't hydrate as much as I do.</v>

1371
01:32:37.670 --> 01:32:39.080
I can drink an entire,

1372
01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:43.760
you could not drink as much long skinny from trader's Joe car and sit in traffic

1373
01:32:43.761 --> 01:32:47.660
for an hour and my bladder accommodates because I'm so used to drinking so much.

1374
01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:52.460
No.
Expands and accommodates the,
the p the urine.
No,
you don't get it.

1375
01:32:52.610 --> 01:32:54.970
Nope.
You don't get it.
First of all,
you don't drink a lot of water.
First of all,

1376
01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:56.200
this is all theatrical.

1377
01:32:56.201 --> 01:32:59.450
I'm going to prove that you're just doing this for the cameras and the cameras

1378
01:32:59.451 --> 01:33:02.510
are off.
It's dehydration city.
Your pee is Brown.

1379
01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:11.740
You're such an animal that doesn't prove anything and these people are just

1380
01:33:12.370 --> 01:33:14.650
totally being a sold a lie.

1381
01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:19.030
If you guys believe this fucking pony show dog and pony nonsense.

1382
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:25.000
Oh my God.
All right Tom.
And now you're going to have to pee again.

1384
01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:29.780
<v 0>Okay.
You're gonna make yourself sick.
Seriously.</v>

1385
01:33:29.781 --> 01:33:31.870
You're not supposed to drink a gallon of water.
You know,

1386
01:33:32.330 --> 01:33:35.510
it's really not good for you.
It is good for you.
And I'd do it every day.

1387
01:33:35.650 --> 01:33:39.700
Oh my God.

usually this time of day

or not watching three quarters of a gallon down hour.

Anybody was a brain in their head knows that that's bad.

1415
01:35:11.210 --> 01:35:14.600
It's not bad to do in one sitting.
It's not a bad thing you've ever done.

1416

Standard for bonds is not standing water champ.

I'm going to the doctor with number one.
That's first of all,

1419
01:35:27.290 --> 01:35:28.123
first of all,

1420
01:35:28.490 --> 01:35:33.490
we had our blood drawn at the doctor's office last week and they couldn't find a

1421
01:35:33.501 --> 01:35:36.590
vein on you because you're so dehydrated and when they did,

1422
01:35:36.770 --> 01:35:39.350
they pulled your blood out.
It was like syrup.
She goes,

1423
01:35:39.351 --> 01:35:44.351
because you're so d absolutely liar to such a filthy liar.

1424

God,
how long did it take?
The nurse has to do with being fat.

1425
01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:55.040
No,
but she,
she pulled your blood out and it was like chocolate,
sir.
No,

1426
01:35:55.041 --> 01:35:59.130
she couldn't find.
She finally did and she goes,
you need to drink more water.
No,

1427
01:35:59.150 --> 01:36:02.630
she had to do water.
No,
she didn't.
No,
she didn't.

1428
01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:06.350
I live with my sociopathic wire.

1429
01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:11.300
I live with a fucking psycho.
She said,
your blood's really thick.

1430
01:36:11.301 --> 01:36:14.960
You need to drink water.
No,
you don't remember those words ever.

1431
01:36:15.530 --> 01:36:20.420
She didn't really think it's so thick.
She did.
She did not make that up.
No,

1432
01:36:20.421 --> 01:36:23.660
she did.
How did I know?
How would I know that I'm not a medical professional.

1433
01:36:23.690 --> 01:36:24.523
Looney tune.

1434
01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:29.560
She offered me how apple juice cause your energy.

1435
01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:34.070
She didn't give me any apple juice or water because I was fine.
She goes,

1436
01:36:34.071 --> 01:36:35.000
your blood is too thick.

1437
01:36:35.001 --> 01:36:39.170
