let's start the show.

60
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.780
<v 0>This is just a memo or a letter to people who microwave or cook fish at work or</v>

61
00:04:13.881 --> 00:04:18.590
just in a public space without some type of consent.

62
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:19.693
Fuck,

63
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.600
<v 1>don't bring anyone in loving to this.
Well,</v>

64
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.240

and

65
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.433
Christina.

66
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.050
<v 2>Oh yeah.
That lady had a really good message.
Action.
That's disrespect.</v>

67
00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:24.820
You know what it remind you of the disrespect of somebody microwaving fish in a

68
00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:29.821
public place is the disrespect of people who board flights with food,

69
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.740
food and people bring curry on your mind.

70
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.871
First of all,

71
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:40.600
why aren't just eat that in the terminal eight that you don't want to eat that

72
00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:45.130
sitting next because there's selfish or nasty or oblivious.
They're narcissist.

73
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.670
Yeah,
they're just horrible people.
Paul.
Yeah,
no.

74
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:51.340
You know it's board flights and you're like year piece of shit.

75
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.390
Why you want to know is even Nastier when you're getting your time massage and

76
00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:58.000
then the waft of curry ghosts.

77
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.880
<v 0>They live because they live in the break room like 10 of them sleep in that tiny</v>

78
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:09.610
little shoe box.
They're just massage slaves,
slave labor now and then,

79
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.300
but that's the only place I can eat.
So that's why I don't get so furious.
I know,

80
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.790
but that's why I don't go to Thai places cause it's a bummer.
I knew.

81
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:20.150
Smelled their pending curry.
It smells delicious and I'm hungry.

82
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.390
You're in the front room and then you're like,
hey,
use the restroom before this.

83
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.230
And then you go to the break room and you're like,
Ooh,

84
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.340
does it hits you like a wave your vegetables today?
Huh?

85
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.140
And you see like 10 people eating out of their Tupperware like,
oh,

86
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.880
can I get some fuel for all this work we're doing?
And then there's like a cot.

87
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.940
That
extra tip.
Okay.
For so relaxed,

88
00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:50.500
but also could you take it out back?
You take your food out bags.

89
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.730
Don't microwave the curry.

90
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.010
How has no one's like push back on that hard enough yet.
Huh?
But the slave labor.

91
00:06:58.011 --> 00:07:01.080
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like guys.
But the food,
I know you're slaves.

92
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.270
I know your slaves.
Could you please take this outside?

93
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.800
Catch me outside.
Yeah.
That's my curry outside.
My,
my,
uh,

94
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.270
my wife from a 2011 just learned cash me outside.

95
00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:16.220
And I tell you what though,
I was thinking about it.

96
00:07:16.221 --> 00:07:20.690
It's because I've been in the haze of raising children for last four years of

97
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.430
toddler and baby land.
You just last week she was like,
catch me outside.

98
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.070
How about that?
Have you heard this?
I'm like,
yeah,

99
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.310
you have you seen the right picking up

100
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:37.790
a little bit of Gina and my La Gangnam style.
Oh,

101
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:42.590
I love
that guy.
He's so clever,
man.

102
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.030
Guys,
I don't have much,
you know what I mean?
It's just

103
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.550
<v 2>my life isn't cool.
It's like this and then my children,</v>

104
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.970
should we talk about this real quick?
Oh,
forget God.
Two things.

105
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.820
Two things are coming to this.
They're in the store now.
Actually if you're,

106
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.200
if you're watching by now,
it's there.

107
00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:02.530
So one is the battle for championship status has never slowed down between us

108
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.650
and we've had so many people weigh in.

109
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.070
That was the fun thing about the water champion.
Interesting.

110
00:08:10.071 --> 00:08:11.570
I'm drinking water right now,

111
00:08:11.571 --> 00:08:15.170
but here's the fascinating thing about the water battle.
Okay.
I,

112
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.800
my doctor told me to stop drinking so much water.
Sure.

113
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:22.460
But people have everywhere in,
in person,

114
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.550
in emails,
direct messages,
tweets,

115
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.890
all then bring out who's the water champ in their lives.
Yes.

116
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.510
It goes back and forth.
Right.
And they've also hit us up.
They're like,

117
00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:35.990
how do you not have a water bottle?
We do.

118
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.860
This is finally a well designed,

119
00:08:39.861 --> 00:08:44.861
well insulated water bottle you can carry around and it has like the thing that

120
00:08:45.501 --> 00:08:48.030
flips up and right.
What are you calling it?

121
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:55.980
<v 0>The water with your mom.
You flip it up and on it on it.
I can't even think of</v>

122
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.140
<v 2>the word.
Water canteen blue.
Anyways,</v>

123
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:04.750
this shit called huh?
Uh,
it's like a builtin Straw.
Right.

124
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.790
But it's like a built in thing at the top that you can suck sippy cups.
Zippy.

125
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:13.320
It's,
you know,
it's an adult sippy cup.
It's an adult sippy bottle.
Anyways,
it's a,

126
00:09:13.321 --> 00:09:16.950
it's got its branded says water champs as your mom's house podcast.

127
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.940
It's in the store.
But what I'm most excited about,

128
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.980
I've never been this excited about a piece of merge in my life.
I did.

129
00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:27.150
If you have not seen it.

130
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:32.300
I did or listen to episode two of Dr Drew's new podcasts that we produced is

131
00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:34.260
called doctor drew after dark.

132
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:39.290
It has been an amazing thing that has that like every week new guests and

133
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.550
there's episodes with Christina,
Bobby Lee,

134
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.570

We just Hardwick it's killers.

136
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.020
So when I was on with him,
he brought up,

137
00:09:55.021 --> 00:09:56.910
cause we had been watching uncle Terry stuff.

138
00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:01.290
Well because in my episode did episode one you did with Uncle Jerry?
Uncle Terry.

139
00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:04.270
And then when by the time you came on,
yeah,
he was like revisited.

140
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.470
He wanted to revisit and he goes,
you know,
I talked to Christina about this,

141
00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:10.770
about what do you think is the,
um,

142
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.630
the like the biggest thing someone should put in their anus.
Um,

143
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.450
and he,
he said that he think hot topic.

144
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.360
Well I just said like it depends what we're talking about.
And he said,

145
00:10:21.361 --> 00:10:22.740
well the average person.
And I was like,

146
00:10:22.741 --> 00:10:24.900
cause there's some people that do double anal.

147
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:29.730
So he goes that that's not the average person.
And he said that he,

148
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.560
he thought that what the biggest thing somebody should put in their anus is if

149
00:10:34.561 --> 00:10:39.330
you make the okay sign that's a medical professional talent,
right.

150
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:44.070
And he's like,
okay,
sign is the extent of how great you should go.
And I said,

151
00:10:44.071 --> 00:10:49.050
what about tripling?
And he was like,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Um,
and then he said,

152
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:53.980
I said,
you know,
there's some things that can happen that if
it,

153
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:59.170
you know,
we're good.
We're good.
Okay.
So anyways,

154
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.480
so anyways,
um,
he ended up using the express,
I said,
you shouldn't do double anal,

155
00:11:05.481 --> 00:11:08.450
Huh?
And he goes,
yeah,
you shouldn't prolapse rain.

156
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.690
And in that moment I said,
I think you just made your first shirt.

157
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.040
And he was like,
Oh God,
what am I doing with my life and my career?

158
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.380
But I didn't forget that.

159
00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:24.410
So I immediately reached out to one of my favorite shirt designers at Maude ink

160
00:11:24.731 --> 00:11:29.340
teas and Augusta,
and they,
I pitched them the whole thing.

161
00:11:29.341 --> 00:11:33.540
What happened?
They came up with this shirt and then I had to reach out to drew.

162
00:11:33.541 --> 00:11:37.710
And his team and be like,
can we do this shirt?
And he was like,

163
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:38.633
fine.

164
00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:44.510
So we have you shouldn't prolapse your anus signed a doctor group with the okay

165
00:11:46.441 --> 00:11:49.560
symbol and they can see this.
I mean,
come on.

166
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.620
I've never been happier about a shirt that we've ever done.

167
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.090
It's in the store.
Prolapse,
prolapse your anus,

168
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.130
you should keep it here.

169
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:09.130
Yeah,
and the best part is that it's Dr drew approved.
It's science.
It's medicine.

170
00:12:09.131 --> 00:12:13.460
This is not a a joke.
No.
Okay.

171
00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:17.230
All right.
Yeah,
we got it.

172
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.040
Was that my step mom?
Really,
really awesome.

173
00:12:24.041 --> 00:12:26.290
So this is back to gene.
This is the lady.

174
00:12:26.291 --> 00:12:30.340
I love this lady's message and mantra and everything so far.
Hold on.

175
00:12:30.341 --> 00:12:34.930
She does meet the criteria for a good why?
Mh Video?
She doesn't have a great set.

176
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:39.130
I'll tell her.
Terrible,
terrible.
Come on.

177
00:12:39.131 --> 00:12:40.420
Any other room in the house?

178
00:12:40.421 --> 00:12:44.770
Even the bathroom would have been better than the depressing blinds.

179
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.940
But I'll tell you this.
She is.
She's with it.
She's on point.
She was coherent.

180
00:12:48.941 --> 00:12:53.941
She knows what's going on and her message come on her meds rare on our air.

181
00:12:54.701 --> 00:12:55.480
On your mouth.

182
00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.460
Her message is one that you cannot deny is absolutely accurate,

183
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.110
okay?
You should not microwave fish in a public setting.
Now,

184
00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:10.540
<v 3>this is just a memo or a letter to people who microwave or cook fish at work or</v>

185
00:13:13.611 --> 00:13:18.320
just in a public space without some type of consent.

186
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.730
Fuck you.
I mean that from the bottom of my heart.
Fuck you.
Fuck your Mama.

187
00:13:22.731 --> 00:13:25.310
Fuck your Daddy.
Fuck the horse you rode in all.

188
00:13:25.311 --> 00:13:28.320
Fuck everybody who loves you cares about you

189
00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:34.490
become apart of making you the person that you are today.

190
00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:39.980
You fucked him.
Fuck all of y'all.
Oh my God.

191
00:13:39.981 --> 00:13:44.390
I found my new best friend.
It's all going to hang out with her public area.

192
00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.510
I don't give a damn.
If it was the last thing that you could eat,

193
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:50.540
I don't give a fuck if it was the only thing that you could eat that month,

194
00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:54.980
that shit is considered as fuck.
You know what fish smell like?

195
00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:59.090
You know what it smelled like.
You knew what it smelled like before you came in.

196
00:13:59.091 --> 00:14:03.110
You knew damn well that when heat is applied to fish,
it stank.

197
00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:03.760
<v 2>She right.</v>

198
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:08.760
You know what I love the most about conceptually is I just love the way the

199
00:14:09.441 --> 00:14:14.441
world works sometimes where you know that she was at work today and somebody

200
00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:21.760
made fish at work and in that setting she just had to look down and just,

201
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.740
you know,
maybe did a couple passive aggressive things like

202
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.830
the hell's that,
you know,
maybe a couple of things like that.
Yeah.

203
00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:37.310
And then talk to a couple of people you smell that and you know,

204
00:14:37.311 --> 00:14:41.030
but then like when the person walked by you had to just kind of just look at

205
00:14:41.031 --> 00:14:45.800
them and carried that feeling home all day,
all day,

206
00:14:45.801 --> 00:14:48.200
carried it home,
set up a camera,

207
00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:52.220
made this recording and like gets like vents it out

208
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.090
<v 0>in,
in a car.
I'm actually in a healthy way.
Yeah.
Gets it out.</v>

209
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.650
And then there's the possible

210
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.350
<v 2>ability,
probably only that someone at work,</v>

211
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:06.090
we'll see this and maybe it'll get to the person

212
00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:10.150
<v 0>you,
you hope that the offenders going to get the message they never do.</v>

213
00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.730
Well no cause they're so Olivia that they do that stuff here.

214
00:15:12.731 --> 00:15:16.330
I'm going to take it one step further.
Having,
I remember working in an office,

215
00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.770
it's not the first time this has happened.
No,
of course not.

216
00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.870
There is the person who's the repeat offender,

217
00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.890
the oblivious person that does the same behavior every day.
That is infuriating.

218
00:15:26.891 --> 00:15:30.470
And this is like the final thing.
You got to have such blinders on.

219
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:36.130
People are terrible.
I know.
It's the same.
It's that same piece of shit.
Of Boards.

220
00:15:36.131 --> 00:15:39.400
The flight.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Here you go.

221
00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:43.720
I brought some fish stew on a flight.
They were like,
what are you doing man?

222
00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:46.480
I know.
I used to have this girl when I worked in the cubicles,

223
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.160
I was selling a telemarketing time and she would talk very loudly on her phone

224
00:15:53.861 --> 00:15:58.480
and laugh like a donkey.
Yeah.
All Day.
All Day.
And I'm like,

225
00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:03.490
you know that everyone else is trying to focus and would laugh like a porn girl.

226
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:05.680
You know?
Like that nervous pornstar like,
yeah.

227
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.220
<v 4>Okay.</v>

228
00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.400
<v 0>Everything is a laugh.
Yeah.
That girl's cool.</v>

229
00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:17.040
I love that girl.
Oh,
that's that girl.

230
00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:20.221
It's funny,

231
00:16:20.221 --> 00:16:25.221
we were talking about the show you before we rolled tight and Josh and love that

232
00:16:25.951 --> 00:16:27.150
show.
I know.
So do I,

233
00:16:27.151 --> 00:16:30.570
where I tore through them all and the guys in the booth and everybody was saying

234
00:16:30.571 --> 00:16:33.960
that.
I see,
I thought the girl,
the love interest in you,
the Blondie,

235
00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:38.010
I thought you guys all had it for her.
Well,
she's a,
she is

236
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:39.060
<v 2>that,</v>

237
00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:44.060
that character is extremely well and specifically constructed.

238
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.390
So it's not that like people are like,
Eh,

239
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.600
dismissive of her is that she's supposed to represent something that you're ill,

240
00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.330
the illusion of perfection,
right.

241
00:16:55.390 --> 00:17:00.390
You see all these flaws and things that you would kind of lose interest in.

242
00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.620
Right.
Because he,
but what would you

243
00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.560
<v 0>cause I thought you guys all had a,
you know,</v>

244
00:17:04.561 --> 00:17:09.450
your smackles were hard for her because she's cute.
She's kind of a Dalmatian.

245
00:17:09.451 --> 00:17:13.730
She's not causing too many.
Yeah.
That's the baits and problematic appeal.

246
00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.700
<v 2>Yeah.
Right,
right.
She doesn't push back.</v>

247
00:17:16.701 --> 00:17:19.610
She's pretty game to f she's totally game.
Yeah.

248
00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:24.230
She's explaining it to me.
So she's not the ideal woman.
Well,

249
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.630
ultimately,
you know,

250
00:17:26.631 --> 00:17:30.920
I mean it depends like person to person what they like,
but I think in the show,

251
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.940
yeah,
she's just a very attractive,
um,

252
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:39.440
the fun kind of idealistic person who is ambitious.

253
00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:44.410
But then you,
you see like how insecure she is,
how it's annoying.
Yeah.
How,

254
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.680
you know,
she's crippled with self doubt,
which is not necessarily,

255
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:49.410
I mean that's a normal thing to feel,

256
00:17:49.411 --> 00:17:53.950
but she's more complicated than just you see the first time you're exposed or

257
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:57.810
you just see her as a pretty face.
Right.
Beautiful Girl.

258
00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.860
And then what's the turn offs?
Is that she's like annoying?
How,
what,

259
00:18:01.861 --> 00:18:06.420
what don't you like?
No,
it's not like it's,
you know,
it's just like anybody,

260
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.160
when you get to know them,
um,
there's just different levels of things going on.

261
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.940
So there's things about her as you watch the show where the character you might

262
00:18:14.941 --> 00:18:18.260
find appealing.
And then there's things that are not,
I mean,
she's ultimately,

263
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.230
it doesn't really know who she is and she's not,

264
00:18:22.231 --> 00:18:26.150
she's really actually not like noncommittal member when they Kinda,

265
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.400
I don't want to give away the show,
but she's not like cool.
Actually.

266
00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:33.420
She doesn't really treat him so cool.
Yeah.
I mean,
no shit.
You know,

267
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:37.050
and then it kind of comes back around.
But I'm just saying like,
it's not just,

268
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.900
she's not presented in the show as like I'm a piece of ass.

269
00:18:39.901 --> 00:18:44.270
That's not really the point of the character.
Yeah,
no,
I hear Ya.
Okay.

270
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.040
But I mean,
I mean there's crazy,

271
00:18:47.041 --> 00:18:50.160
there's a couple of crazy chicks and the show that make their smuggles harder.

272
00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:56.580
Peaches,
peaches,
peaches,
peaches is fucking down.

273
00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:01.590
So what do you like about her over the lead girl?
What's,
what's the appeal to PG?

274
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.190
Well,
you don't know her as well,
so it's,
it's easier to be intimate with her

275
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:12.540
and then talk about that.
No,
she's,
she's rough.
You know she's got,

276
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.860
she's the one that like you could get some chains and like you could,
you know,

277
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.690
really kind of,
I don't think you got that.
You'd have a blondie.

278
00:19:20.691 --> 00:19:24.570
You can't do that with peaches.
Oh,
I think peaches is,
is down for a good time.

279
00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:28.050
Okay.
I do.
I think,
I think peaches,
you could spit in her face.
You could do it.

280
00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:34.670
All right,
great.
Okay.
Moving along.
We have some other topics.
We,

281
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:38.850
we took our overnight,
we did our mommy daddy hotel stay overnight.

282
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:43.360
I recommend that to anybody that has children if you can.
Yeah.

283
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:48.000
What you do is you call,
yeah,
call the grandparents.
Call Your,
you know,

284
00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:51.150
your sibling or your the best babysitter,
you know,
and go,

285
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:56.540
can you watch the kids for one that's coming to the house for one night and what

286
00:19:57.211 --> 00:20:00.390
we ended up doing was sleeping.

287
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.990
You can't map when you have little,
you never,
we never,

288
00:20:03.991 --> 00:20:08.610
now you try to nap and then you just hear screaming and crying.
I loved it.

289
00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:12.180
Oh my God.
I loved it until we had dinner.
Well hold on.
First of all,

290
00:20:12.181 --> 00:20:14.730
I took a two hour nap,
let's talk about it.
That was pretty ridiculous.

291
00:20:14.731 --> 00:20:16.550
And I slept for 11 hours.
That's how,

292
00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.850
and then we went to dinner and it was a patio seating.

293
00:20:20.851 --> 00:20:24.810
And in Los Angeles right now the weather is on the border of being acceptable to

294
00:20:24.811 --> 00:20:29.040
eat outside at night.
I said there's heat lamps and I,

295
00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:34.100
I asked to be sat under the heat lamp cause I'm very cold and I they turned it

296
00:20:34.831 --> 00:20:38.650
up nice and high.
I turned it up to full blast.
Like,

297
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:43.290
like if it were 30 and you're like I need a heat lamp to see it sit outside.

298
00:20:43.291 --> 00:20:48.100
They did that except it was about 68 felt good.
And

299
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.090
<v 0>then I was nice and toasty and you were sitting next to me in the booth and then</v>

300
00:20:52.091 --> 00:20:56.560
I and I,
I'm high.
That's the first thing you aim.
Ha ha ha.
And I go,

301
00:20:56.561 --> 00:20:58.690
you're wearing what?
You're wearing a shirt.

302
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:08.160
That's what I hear it as complete.
Oh my God.

303
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:10.800
Fucking says,
wow,
okay.
I know.

304
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.240
Here's where it gets even dicier who says

305
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:20.050
crying about how hot you are so that you are wearing a sweatshirt.
First of all,

306
00:21:20.051 --> 00:21:23.970
y'all let the record show I was wearing a normal,

307
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:29.050
a normal hook like that in that temperature it was like appropriate.

308
00:21:29.051 --> 00:21:31.660
Like that would keep you sufficiently,

309
00:21:31.661 --> 00:21:36.310
can hat take off a layer if you're hot,

310
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.440
but you wouldn't take off your stern on layer,

311
00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:45.180
you have a mental problem and you have an the heat lamp.

312
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:49.510
It literally felt like you were just sitting next to an open oven

313
00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.000
500 and you're like,
let's just sit next to this open of it.
And it felt great.

314
00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:55.960
So here's the deal man.

315
00:21:55.961 --> 00:21:59.330
So you sat next to me and then you say ain't hat and then I go case,

316
00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.720
I'll then move away so that you don't,

317
00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.920
you're setting and then so you sat across from me.

318
00:22:02.921 --> 00:22:05.320
So now you're as far away from the heat lamp as you can be.

319
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.780
And I thought that would solve the problem.

320
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.830
But then I watched you get more and more agitated.

321
00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:18.760
It was like a silent buildup of rage.
Like,

322
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.620
I like how you're looking at me right now.
Like that's silent rage.

323
00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.750
And I was like,
and then I,
okay.

324
00:22:25.751 --> 00:22:28.570
Then I finally gave in and I had them turn it down.
I remember.

325
00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.170
Or you got up and you turn it off.
That was the last thing.

326
00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:34.990
So he turned down and then I came next to you and I cuddled you.
And I said,

327
00:22:34.991 --> 00:22:39.310
why are you,
I go,
what are you,
are you mad at me for having it so high?

328
00:22:39.311 --> 00:22:41.400
And you're like,
yes,
you're ruining dinner.
Yeah.

329
00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:46.390
And he was really legitimately mad at me.
Like you got really mad.
Yeah,
of course.

330
00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.600
But I'm cold.
Why?
Why are you mad at me for feeling?

331
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:54.370
Because it's a stupid field out of my control.
It's not grow up,

332
00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:58.540
but I can't control how I was raised in La.
It's warm here.

333
00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:02.350
I'm used to being warm.
It was ridiculous.
You ruined everybody's dinner.

334
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:07.410
People at the other tables were like genders being ruined and yes they did.

335
00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:12.080
No,
you're the only one.
Ain't fucking stupidity.

336
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.700
That guy makes a lot of sense.
So he gets mad at me because of my,

337
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.610
my cold threshold is low and then we're driving in the car yesterday to the

338
00:23:21.611 --> 00:23:26.120
country club.
It gave them all and you are showing me how you could sporty drive.

339
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:27.190
First of all,

340
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:32.190
I was not showing you how I could sporty drive a Jeep Cherokee with a v six like

341
00:23:35.801 --> 00:23:38.420
a normal engine.
Nothing crazy.

342
00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:42.910
Michael's car and the light turns green.

343
00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:48.040
I turned,
we're going straight.
I hit the gas.
We hit 40 NAM.

344
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:52.000
Yes,
we did 46 and the the speed limit,

345
00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:56.970
35 maybe 40 at the most in that residential.

346
00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:03.590
And you go,
you're scaring me.
I was like,
what?
And you go,
you're scaring me.

347
00:24:03.591 --> 00:24:08.360
I go,
why would you be scared?
Don't tell me.
Window feel fear,
right.

348
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:13.190
I looked and then he,
and then he gets mad at me for feeling fear.

349
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:21.680
Wait,
but why can't I be scared?
I mean you can,
but don't you think that's like,

350
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:28.160
well,
you got mad at me.
I hit 40 miles an hour.

351
00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:32.180
Crazy.
It's crazy.
Or that you felt fear.

352
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:35.150
You've been in a car for how many years you did?

353
00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.900
You were doing 46 and a 35 and you accelerated very quickly.

354
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:41.090
And we were by the mall and I thought,

355
00:24:41.091 --> 00:24:43.610
you've somehow got to slow down to get into that parking.

356
00:24:43.611 --> 00:24:47.390
Let me tell you this scenario,
if it were a kid in the car and the kid was like,

357
00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:50.870
no,
the kid was like,
I was scared.
You'd be like,
all right,

358
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:55.110
you shouldn't feel fear because this is how cars move.
But you'd be like,
okay.

359
00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.590
And then later on you'd be like,
Hey,
my kid's a fucking idiot.
Huh?

360
00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:01.993
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

361
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:11.300
<v 0>Like I'm saying is you,
were you really scared?</v>

362
00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:15.950
What were you scared for?
The feeling.
Listen,
I drive it.

363
00:25:15.951 --> 00:25:18.860
Here's why 40 listen,
listen,

364
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:22.640
I drive a jeep Cherokee because I don't like going fast.
Okay?

365
00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:26.210
But I was in your jeep.
Cherise it.
I'm driving to the mall and back.

366
00:25:26.211 --> 00:25:28.490
That's my life.
I don't do fucking anything.
Okay.

367
00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:32.600
So I like to drive the speed that I go slow.
I listened to my radio,

368
00:25:32.601 --> 00:25:36.080
you know what I mean?
And then for you to get in my car and do your,
your,

369
00:25:36.081 --> 00:25:39.950
your race car driving.
It was very tea.
I don't like it.
It's startling.

370
00:25:39.951 --> 00:25:42.350
I like to go slow.
Listen,
let me tell you something.

371
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:47.420
I just renewed my license online.
Why?
Because I have no moving violations.

372
00:25:47.421 --> 00:25:51.260
I have no tickets.
I have nothing.
I get that privilege because I'm a safe driver.

373
00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.140
Yeah.
I thought I was going to get ticket last night.
Good.
I wish you would have.

374
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:58.530
Why to teach you a lesson about your sporty driving.
40 try me.

375
00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:03.350
You almost got a ticket.
I thought I was going to get one.
Yeah.
Oh,
for speeding?

376
00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:08.280
Yeah,
on the,
on the freeway.
But it was,
you know,
11 o'clock at night.
Okay.
Freeway.

377
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:09.163
Cool.

378
00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:14.740
So we went to the country club yesterday and I'm walking around and we made a

379
00:26:15.411 --> 00:26:18.110
few observations.
Number one,
we saw it.

380
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:22.070
We always make fun of that store as we walked by it.
The Tommy Bahama store.

381
00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:23.960
Yeah.

382
00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:28.820
I can't believe that that store thrives in this market for like 2030 years now.

383
00:26:28.821 --> 00:26:31.610
My Stepdad,
my Indian step dad,
God rest his soul.
He's dead now.

384
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.620
He loved Tommy Bahama and he was a big,
big guy.
Like he was,

385
00:26:36.621 --> 00:26:41.420
he got real fat.
Yeah.
And He loved it.
And it was official dad status of fish.

386
00:26:41.421 --> 00:26:44.160
All Dad's dad is and that's really what Tommy Bahamas

387
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.060
<v 6>all about.
Catering to the official dad market.
Yeah.
Cause like you,</v>

388
00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:52.200
you've pretty much given up.
Right?
If you're wearing like a Tommy Bahama Flora,

389
00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:56.340
most disgusting friends who were,

390
00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:59.260
who gave up a while ago.
But oddly enough,

391
00:26:59.261 --> 00:27:02.190
if you have to give up but have some money because they're not cheap.
Is that,

392
00:27:02.191 --> 00:27:04.350
I didn't know how much or how much is a Tommy,

393
00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.530
can you bring up a shirt so we can see so the audience can see what we're

394
00:27:07.531 --> 00:27:11.910
talking about in case they don't know.
It's like it's a very specific style.

395
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:14.660
It makes them really large cuts.
Right?
Isn't that the whole thing?

396
00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.820
Is that the whole thing?
Well I have some really fat friends that wear them.

397
00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:22.640
Oh look,
they have women's clothes at Tommy Bahama.
Oh there it is.

398
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:27.130
Now go back to that.
Oh yeah.
Look at all those big and tall.
Oh,
that's why.
Well,

399
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:31.040
that's why my step dad was into it.
Yeah.
Now it makes sense.
Yeah.

400
00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:37.140
Those are dad shirts.
Go to the floor.
All that's like the tip of the Dad Berg.

401
00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:42.180
It's like the button downs.
That's what my stepdad loved.

402
00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:46.350
There you go.
That guy.
That's the official.
It's there.
There it is.

403
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:50.730
That's how I picture.
But how much are those shirts?
Fuck,
thank on.

404
00:27:50.731 --> 00:27:55.731
That 100 and what hundred 40 you got to have your dad with a job.

405
00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:02.470
That's a fortune 150 for that shirt.
No.

406
00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.090
Yeah,
so you can't even buy it as a gag.
You can't be like

407
00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:09.900
a shirt.
I know.

408
00:28:09.901 --> 00:28:14.370
That's a fortune 101 60 oh my God.

409
00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:18.720
Shit man.
Fuck,
that's Margaritaville.

410
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:23.490
That's the dad who's like listens to Kokomo and here's what happened.
You know,

411
00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:28.230
you're 360 whatever pounds.
You're like,
I got to wear like a decent shirt.

412
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.920
They make you this six x,
you know,

413
00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.550
and then you look like I'm trying,
you know,
I'm dressing nice,

414
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:40.900
but it really is a really bad patterns.
When you're fat,
it's,

415
00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:43.990
it's even worse.
You got to go in minimalist molest when you're fat.
You know,

416
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.260
I guess I dunno,
but there's like,
you know there's outdoors.

417
00:28:47.261 --> 00:28:50.100
He dads and vacation does vacation.

418
00:28:50.101 --> 00:28:55.020
Dads want to look good and have fun even if they're a real fat,
you know,

419
00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:59.880
I cannot get over the prices.
I have no idea.
I guess they want to price that one.

420
00:28:59.881 --> 00:29:04.530
One 70 on the right.
That one.
Oh my gosh.

421
00:29:04.531 --> 00:29:07.880
Shirts are terrible.
That shirt.
No.

422
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:10.020
Welcome to real world.

423
00:29:10.021 --> 00:29:15.021
Spelled r e l with a like a sword fish jumping out the Tommy Bahama Lounge.

424
00:29:16.501 --> 00:29:19.590
That's $170 the heck out of here.

425
00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:24.750
God Damn sure fit for the o fit for the island life.

426
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:28.060
Yeah,
it's for vacation dead.
That's why they're dropping that kind of coin.

427
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:31.500
Banana,
I had no wait.
Let's see the size chart.
What's the size?

428
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:37.510
What's it go up to?
Four.
Four.
That's pretty big.
Yeah,

429
00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:42.370
it's really a real dad.
What's,
what does that say?
Xcel

430
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:47.080
<v 2>be?
What's Xcel be though?
That says,
yeah,</v>

431
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:52.200
I'm not 100% sure what open the size chart be as big XLT is tall.

432
00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:56.650
Ah,
look at the fitness guy here,
knows what's up.

433
00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:00.300
I know the,
the voice of your run.

434
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.470
You just heard any works here too.

435
00:30:02.471 --> 00:30:07.471
He's like the coolest hippest guy who wanted to buy him some time Mahama stuff.

436
00:30:07.811 --> 00:30:09.990
But then we realized he'd make that shit cool.
Yeah.

437
00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:14.830
We'd lose the whole point of the laugh.
Oh,
there's five XL on the bag.

438
00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:16.150
Oh yeah.

439
00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.230
<v 0>But Hey,
I give it,
I give it.
You're right.</v>

440
00:30:18.231 --> 00:30:23.000
I like what you're saying that if you're GE,
you know,
listen,
I just ha,
you know,

441
00:30:23.001 --> 00:30:26.900
I'm eight months now postpartum and when you're heavier than you normally are,

442
00:30:26.901 --> 00:30:30.530
it's important to dress up even if you're in the process of losing weight or

443
00:30:30.531 --> 00:30:35.460
whatever.
Um,
but really brought us to the point that,
um,

444
00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.620
you know,
we were talking about,

445
00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:40.050
I was telling you how I'm still kind of not in the body that I'd like to,

446
00:30:40.051 --> 00:30:44.540
but I'm still losing weight and um,
and how everyone hates their bodies.

447
00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.640
Everybody does.
Everybody.
I even,

448
00:30:46.641 --> 00:30:50.330
I was in h and m and there is this adorable 20 something year old girl trying on

449
00:30:50.331 --> 00:30:54.130
a shirt with her friend and she's like,
I don't know,
it just,
it looked,

450
00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:57.860
I look fat and I,
and I said this towards like as a mom,
like I told them,
mom,

451
00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:01.820
I was like,
I go,
sweet.
I've just,
I'm overhearing you.
You look amazing.

452
00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.370
You're so pretty.
Just buy the damn shirt.
I said,

453
00:31:04.371 --> 00:31:06.980
just do it once you say mind your business,
you fucking bitch.

454
00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:11.510
But her friend was like,
see,
I told you.
She was like,
yeah,
that lady,

455
00:31:11.511 --> 00:31:12.530
that crazy ladies,
right?
Yeah,

456
00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.630
<v 2>yeah.
Basically.
Yeah,
it's totally true.
I mean,</v>

457
00:31:15.631 --> 00:31:20.631
I hate my body so much and I try not to just dwell in it all the time.

458
00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:22.340
Of course we all,

459
00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:26.820
but then like my trainer who I work out with a few times a week,
last week,

460
00:31:26.821 --> 00:31:31.710
he's like,
oh,
I'm doing a a 75 day challenge.
And I go,
what's that?
He's like,

461
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:36.150
you work out twice a day for 75 days.
And I was like,
why?

462
00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.570
And he was like,
well,
just you know,
try to get an a,

463
00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:43.490
I'll let kind of let myself go a little bit.
I was like,
what?
Like,
no,

464
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.750
you're the student body is amazing.

465
00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:50.340
I see him in a tee shirt and shorts.
I'm like,
we talk at your totally ripped.

466
00:31:50.341 --> 00:31:53.010
He's like,
Nah,
there's not like a used to be.

467
00:31:53.011 --> 00:31:57.630
And I was working out twice a day for 75 days.
That's crazy.

468
00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:00.270
And he's like,
you know,
I go,
do you notice any different,

469
00:32:00.271 --> 00:32:02.130
cause it's been like a week or tonight.
He's like,
Oh yeah,

470
00:32:02.131 --> 00:32:06.300
I've been taking pictures and we're talking like minuscule differences.

471
00:32:06.301 --> 00:32:09.390
But to him and his mind,
what he sees in the mirror,

472
00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:13.260
I don't know very few people I think go like I love my body.
I agree.

473
00:32:13.261 --> 00:32:17.370
We all kind of,
I do now because I go like,
look what my body made.

474
00:32:17.371 --> 00:32:20.600
It made two wonderful humans that we adore more than that.
Now.

475
00:32:20.601 --> 00:32:25.560
I kind of really admire those people that don't have perfect bodies,

476
00:32:25.561 --> 00:32:29.460
but you can tell they really accept their bodies.

477
00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:33.750
Hey now I kind of admire that we,
how do we get there?
Is that,
is that,

478
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:38.940
I don't know.
I've talked about it in therapy a lot.
Your Ba.
Yeah.
Yeah.

479
00:32:38.941 --> 00:32:43.010
And the solution.
It's what you think it is.
That's what it is.

480
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.890
What's that love.

481
00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:50.480
And then there's people that I'm like your body and think that you're perfect.

482
00:32:51.261 --> 00:32:53.840
You're adorable.
You'd like it hot outside.

483
00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:01.190
I think I love your Toshi this morning till she's adorable.
I was looking at it.

484
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:06.320
Thanks Babe.
I love you taking berries.
Thanks.
Durable.
Yup.
Shoulders,

485
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:09.170
handsome,
nice shoulders.
That's when you know you have a ship body.

486
00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:12.770
When someone was like your elbows,
they're great,

487
00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:17.770
you got nice risks and you're like Eh,

488
00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:21.320
good shoulders.
No one looking at your knees.

489
00:33:21.321 --> 00:33:24.980
I've got beautiful knees but telling you wish you could tell your 20 year old

490
00:33:24.981 --> 00:33:29.000
self.
Cause even when I was 20 and I weighed nothing and I was super skinny,

491
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.700
I still was like,
man,
I'm so fat.
Like,
dude,

492
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.860
don't you wish you could tell your 20 year old self like,
Hey,

493
00:33:33.861 --> 00:33:38.150
you think you're fat now wait until you're 40.
Remember it makes me want to cry.

494
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:42.170
The time where I was a weight,
I had lost all this weight.

495
00:33:42.171 --> 00:33:46.760
So I got really fat and then I lost all this weight.
I lost like 70 pounds.

496
00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:51.650
I was in the best shape I'd ever been in.
And I remember I was on,

497
00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:56.630
I was on a trip and I was with a buddy of mine and we were,
it was like a,

498
00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.720
like a spring break kind of thing.
It was hot outside.

499
00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:02.930
I didn't really know him that well.
Like I knew him,
but I was like,

500
00:34:02.931 --> 00:34:05.780
I know how fair skinned I am.
I was like,
dude,
I gotta ask you something.

501
00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.400
And then were in college to where I was like,

502
00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:12.500
well you put this sunblock on my back cause I'll burn.
And he was like,

503
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:16.730
yeah,
I don't care.
And I was like,
all right,
cool.
He goes,
I mean,
why would I care?

504
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:21.080
Uh,
putting a sunblock on it,
some fat guy.
And I was like,
fuck.

505
00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:25.340
I was like,
I fucking like no.
In my head I was like,
I'm still fat.

506
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:30.140
I just lost 70 pounds.
So I was like this.
So in my head I was like,

507
00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:34.160
I'm still fat now.
Now that was like,
fuck,

508
00:34:34.161 --> 00:34:35.720
I was 21,
you know,

509
00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:41.390
and then when asked me if I was pregnant yesterday and that felt good to know.

510
00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:44.570
No,
you walked her into that one.
She didn't,

511
00:34:44.571 --> 00:34:46.980
she didn't understand what you were saying.
You're like,
you're like,
oh,

512
00:34:46.981 --> 00:34:49.730
I just had,
I'm having this baby.
And she,
she had,

513
00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:53.030
she understood I'm having this baby and then she was like,
oh,
you're pregnant.

514
00:34:53.031 --> 00:34:54.560
Okay.
Whatever.
The Nail Lady,

515
00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:58.010
we asked me if I was talking to that lady and she's four and you know,

516
00:34:58.011 --> 00:34:59.000
foreigners,
they don't know anything.

517
00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:03.140
She was heating up or curry in the back room.
They don't even speak English.

518
00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:07.590
Go fucking sleep outside.
You tell her that once you do my nails,

519
00:35:07.591 --> 00:35:08.424
just shut the fuck up.

520
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:16.040
Don't you love that we have this show

521
00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:21.090
telling us what we can and can't say.
You know what?
F Mcdonald's.

522
00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:27.830
Okay.
So,
um,
you know,
I did,
um,
I didn't,

523
00:35:27.831 --> 00:35:31.310
I don't think,
I don't even know if I mentioned it before on this show.

524
00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:36.880
I actually did a set in Spanish last night.
I know,

525
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.570
I'm so proud of you.
That must've been so hard.
It was,

526
00:35:39.571 --> 00:35:42.060
it was something I've always wanted to do.
Like I've been wanting,

527
00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:45.090
I've wanted to do this for years.

528
00:35:45.091 --> 00:35:50.091
I've always done little bits of Spanish like at night in every special,

529
00:35:50.701 --> 00:35:54.870
but I think I've done it in to where I've mentioned something you're cursing or

530
00:35:54.871 --> 00:35:59.390
you have like a fire.
I'll tell like one story that involves the fact that I,

531
00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:03.420
you know,
was raised speaking Spanish and I'll,
I'll do a bit,
but like,
you know,

532
00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:07.650
we're talking of an hour show one minute or something,
but I always was like,

533
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.240
oh man.
Cause Spanish has been,

534
00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:14.190
or saying it's been getting bigger in Spanish language countries the last few

535
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:16.200
years.
It's really starting to grow.
And I'm always like,

536
00:36:16.201 --> 00:36:20.920
I wonder if I could do a full set in Spanish.
Yeah.
So fuck,

537
00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:21.510
sorry.

538
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:26.010
I've been talking to a couple guys about it for a few months and they're like,

539
00:36:26.011 --> 00:36:29.370
yeah,
we do it every once in awhile.
And I was like,
yeah,
I want to do it.

540
00:36:29.371 --> 00:36:31.620
But I was kind of like,
you know,
hesitant.
I was like,

541
00:36:31.621 --> 00:36:35.790
I don't know if I can actually do it.
So anyways,
a few weeks ago,

542
00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:39.510
uh,
Francisco Ramos hits me up.
He's like,
we're going to do the show.

543
00:36:39.511 --> 00:36:44.430
Do you want to do it?
And by the way,
he's great.
He's great,
nicest guy.
And um,

544
00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:48.090
he's like Ricky Ricardo,
like the guy has got,
yeah,
that Kinda,

545
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:52.380
he's got the Hollywood energy about him.
Yeah.
Very positive.
Very funny.

546
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.790
And he's like,
do you want to do it?
And I just,
without even thinking,
I go,
yes,

547
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.570
I want to do it.
And then I was,

548
00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:02.490
and then I see them put the poster out like the Flyer and I was like,
Oh shit.

549
00:37:02.491 --> 00:37:04.950
Sabado Domingo.
Yeah.
But I'm like,
this is real.

550
00:37:04.951 --> 00:37:08.220
Now that there's a guy in clown makeup,

551
00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.160
but he'll have to write really big bets for Allie.

552
00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:23.460
We did the thing.
So they put the these guys,
I guess they do it.

553
00:37:23.461 --> 00:37:27.840
Semi-Regularly um,
so fuck buddies.

554
00:37:27.841 --> 00:37:32.790
Eco Cabana is a Chilean comic speak Mexican.
This dude,

555
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:37.410
he already,
he's like,
uh,
actually to me,
I love it.
He's white.
Married you.

556
00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:40.090
Why don't you Latin it up more?
You know,
I love Puerto Rica.

557
00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:43.680
Haim and Hayes was Trey.
Hello Trey.
Hello.

558
00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:47.220
Name Francisco Ramos,
Eh.
So anyways,

559
00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:51.840
they do this show called a trifecta.
We did it with a,

560
00:37:51.841 --> 00:37:56.070
I think who else was on this show?
Fuck this guy.
Hot something Colombian guy.

561
00:37:56.310 --> 00:38:00.770
Richard via Philippe's.
Parsa he's been on the show by your mom's house.
Okay.

562
00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:05.100
Did it also last night anyways,
we sign up to do it.

563
00:38:05.101 --> 00:38:09.660
Show sells out like in the first day.
Was that the lab?
And then,

564
00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:13.170
um,
and then I'm like,
Oh shit,
I'm writing this stuff.
And then I'm,

565
00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:16.320
I'm basically having Francisco helped me.

566
00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.380
So I would send him my jokes and he was like,
you should say it this way,

567
00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:24.360
not this way.
He's translating stuff for me.
And then I'm like,
I actually,
I,

568
00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:29.370
I realized that I was having the same feelings for this show that I had doing

569
00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.780
stand up 17 years ago.
Like when,
uh,

570
00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:36.880
17 years ago when I started doing standup,
you,
we would book,
you know,

571
00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:41.110
you'd have like first you'd have one show a month,
let's say you'd go,

572
00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.320
I'm doing stand up next month.
And that's it.

573
00:38:44.321 --> 00:38:46.900
That's your show for six or eight weeks or something.

574
00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:49.180
And as you get closer to that show,

575
00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:54.670
you're writing things out like full length pages and you're reviewing them and

576
00:38:54.671 --> 00:38:56.320
then you're starting to get like you're editing.

577
00:38:56.321 --> 00:38:59.890
As you get closer and you're getting nervous and you wake up thinking about your

578
00:38:59.891 --> 00:39:02.920
show it,
you'd had so much pressure to do that show.

579
00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.860
And I don't have those feelings like that obviously and more because I've done

580
00:39:05.861 --> 00:39:07.420
it for this many years.

581
00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:12.010
But this Spanish show was kind of close to that where,

582
00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:13.870
I mean I didn't pop out of my sleep,

583
00:39:13.871 --> 00:39:17.010
but I was like walking around and thinking about how am I going?

584
00:39:17.011 --> 00:39:20.740
Cause you have to think about like,
you don't get any reps in Spanish.

585
00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:24.010
So you don't know like,
yeah,
what's gonna work?
What's not gonna work?

586
00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:27.910
What's gonna happen as far as timing and saying the punchline the right way

587
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:31.730
anyways,
it went great.
I had the best time doing it.
Good.

588
00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:35.610
I'm definitely gonna do it again and um,
I don't know.
I had to,

589
00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:37.260
I had a great time,
so I appreciate those.

590
00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.810
<v 0>Got It.
How do you,
you say things that you know,</v>

591
00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:42.220
you just translate your current act,
so you're alleging

592
00:39:42.350 --> 00:39:43.070
<v 2>two things.</v>

593
00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:47.390
I did things that were specifically just for a Spanish language audience.

594
00:39:47.391 --> 00:39:52.391
So I wrote material just for the show and then I also translated some things I'm

595
00:39:52.881 --> 00:39:55.700
doing right now into Spanish.
Tried that.

596
00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:59.140
<v 0>Do you ever think your wife's a dumb bitch?
Yeah.
Something like that.</v>

597
00:39:59.141 --> 00:40:01.870
Like is your wife angry you with how cold she gets?

598
00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:04.460
I ain't going through this process on a bow tie

599
00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:08.203
and

600
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:16.090
stuff like that.
I love it.
I lay way about what does that mean?
Yeah,

601
00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:21.130
give her that nut.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I'm so excited about the Spanish Tom.

602
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:24.330
I like to see more of Spanish.
Tom.
I Spanish.

603
00:40:24.331 --> 00:40:27.700
I was going to be working it out more it I think so.

604
00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:30.670
Hey tacos in my pocket.
I be mad.

605
00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:35.650
The do you like the Tacos?
You liked that Patheo or Cholula.

606
00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:38.200
Is that what you're going to open with it the next time?
Maybe.
You know what?

607
00:40:38.201 --> 00:40:39.580
I was funny.
I did that show last night.

608
00:40:39.581 --> 00:40:44.581
At one point I asked who in the audience had kids and like one tablecloth and I

609
00:40:45.161 --> 00:40:49.300
was like,
what the fuck is this?
A whole rumor.

610
00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:53.620
People at one table has kids.
How's that even?
Right.
It's never,

611
00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:56.320
that never happens.
All they do is fuck.
Okay,

612
00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:01.350
well I mean that's very problematic.
Shit.

613
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:05.530
You're fucking from the fifth grade.
That's really what's up.
Well,

614
00:41:05.531 --> 00:41:08.830
you've said that before.
The growing up in Florida,
especially in Miami,

615
00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:13.570
that was a different culture.
Very Miami.
You're like,
I have a Pokemon.

616
00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:15.850
And they're like,
do you finger girls too?
And you're like,
what?

617
00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.570
I'm an elementary school.
And they're like,
so are we man,
it's Miami.

618
00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.820
They're really crazy that at least they were when I was growing up.
Yeah.

619
00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.870
The first time I was sexually harassed,

620
00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:30.220
I was like a 11 or 12 and it was like this Latin dude I went to school with and

621
00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:34.130
he was like,
he goes,
he goes,
damn girl,
you got a though just won't

622
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:37.550
<v 6>quit.
And I was like,
oh 11 and I was like,
what?</v>

623
00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:41.750
I don't even have a body yet.
You know what I mean?
Him was like,

624
00:41:41.751 --> 00:41:45.200
all right cool.
I got my kids on

625
00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.730
wearing a training bra.
Oh my God.

626
00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:57.260
Friend of ours,

627
00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:05.210
comedian,
comedian,
writer,
director,

628
00:42:05.211 --> 00:42:09.500
producer,
choreographer,
entrepreneur,

629
00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:14.090
long overdue vessel.
A vessel,
sovereign citizen.

630
00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:15.243
It is,

631
00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:21.070
I haven't tried to join a fake sovereign country wants out of a magazine.

632
00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:24.530
I can just remember that there's this art magazine,

633
00:42:24.531 --> 00:42:25.790
I think it was called cabinet.

634
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000
And they did an article about like areas where that were like specific enough to

635
00:42:31.491 --> 00:42:34.490
where like someone had formed a fake sovereign country that you could,

636
00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:38.840
and I sent like my fucking social security number basically to somewhere in

637
00:42:38.841 --> 00:42:43.010
Australia cause there was like a building where one of the floors was considered

638
00:42:43.011 --> 00:42:46.400
a sovereign country and you can become a citizen of it.
And I was like,

639
00:42:46.401 --> 00:42:50.690
do it and and I didn't get anything in an email.
Can you send a check to,
no,

640
00:42:50.691 --> 00:42:51.650
it wasn't any money.

641
00:42:51.651 --> 00:42:55.670
I just sent like my info like can I please become a citizen of this fake
country?

642
00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:58.310
But then you have to pay taxes to them.
No,
I think that was the whole,

643
00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:02.030
I think that's why people do it is to not pay taxes.
I love,
I'm a country,

644
00:43:02.031 --> 00:43:05.140
you can't charge me shit.
I'm a country,
a country.

645
00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:08.930
That's where they tried to do in that wild,
wild country where they were like,

646
00:43:08.931 --> 00:43:10.790
we're our own state or city or whatever.

647
00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:15.590
I also realized that like at a certain point if enough people said they are,

648
00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.900
you kind of would have to acknowledge it,
right?
Yeah.

649
00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.170
We have enough people say anything.
Eventually you're like,
fine.
Yeah.

650
00:43:21.171 --> 00:43:24.170
That's how it words get defined.
They're like,
well,
what the word means?
No,

651
00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:28.850
it's not really a word and then enough people say it and it becomes a word is a

652
00:43:28.851 --> 00:43:32.990
word.
It is now.
It wasn't a 10 years ago.
I swear to God.

653
00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:35.590
Now back to the most important thing at hand.

654
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:40.270
Right before we started rolling here regardless.
Go ahead.
Rip Freddy Soto.

655
00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:45.290
Rest in peace.
Ready.
So ear regardless,
one of the great bits of all time.

656
00:43:45.291 --> 00:43:46.460
Is that what I'm about?
His Dad,

657
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:51.790
his dad said Irregardless is that would be the bit was about inserting that word

658
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:55.520
places where it didn't belong you,
but he'd say it all the time.
It was great.

659
00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:59.600
This is such a great bit.
No.
Yeah,
but you brought up a really good phrase.

660
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:03.740
It's like I've been waiting my whole life for somebody to say it the way you

661
00:44:03.741 --> 00:44:07.970
just did.
Out of context singing.
I hate it.

662
00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:10.490
I fucking hate it.
To give you an example,

663
00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:15.740
some people that can sing think they're blessing us all the time with their

664
00:44:15.741 --> 00:44:20.170
beautiful voice.
So you're in the frozen food aisle and you just hear Ah,

665
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:25.370
shut your damn mouth.
I didn't ask for this and might run in bed or hold on,

666
00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:30.500
let's stop the West Slang.
I bad.
Was I at Gelson's?

667
00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:30.960
Yeah.

668
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:35.960
Day sever peoples was whistling along with the music and I it myself,

669
00:44:36.091 --> 00:44:39.600
I was like stop it.
And so I stopped.
Yeah,
no,
but here's what I hate too,

670
00:44:39.601 --> 00:44:42.230
is like you're watching a talk show and the,

671
00:44:42.231 --> 00:44:45.990
the young ingenue was there and the host goes,
oh,
you're a singer.

672
00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:47.040
Sing us something.

673
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:51.510
And then they're forced to sing without any music or any preparation.

674
00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:52.393
And it makes me,

675
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:58.780
<v 7>I can sing.
And that was pretty good song.
I have a good voice to go for it.</v>

676
00:44:58.781 --> 00:44:59.630
Go tell me.

677
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:06.360
<v 6>Do you like it?
I hate that it makes me so uncomfortable.</v>

678
00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:10.380
Then the person has to sing on cue.
That's like someone,
like,
I'm a comedian,

679
00:45:10.381 --> 00:45:14.070
tell me a joke.
And you're like,
that was literally the worst,
the worst.

680
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:15.301
So I was in the,

681
00:45:15.301 --> 00:45:19.020
I was in the hallway at the comedy store and some lady was talking to the person

682
00:45:19.021 --> 00:45:23.580
next to me and she goes,
are you going on?
I said,
yeah.
And she goes,
oh,
so like,

683
00:45:23.581 --> 00:45:27.240
what's your act?
And I wanted to joke just was go,
I go,
I tell jokes.

684
00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:30.390
And I looked at her in a way that told her,
you're wrong for what you just did.

685
00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:34.920
Yeah,
yeah.
How'd she respond?
She was like,
ah,
yeah,

686
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.550
you call her stupid cat.
No,
he kind of could have,

687
00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:43.060
I said it with my eyes sag after us.
The worst is a so what,

688
00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.290
what's it all about?
What do you do it?
What's it like?

689
00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:49.140
If I knew that I wouldn't be here if I had a sense of what anything was about,

690
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.940
I wouldn't be here.
Right.
Yeah.
I wouldn't be clawing at the walls of approval.

691
00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:59.040
Yeah.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
Worst is the way that question is the worst.
Also,

692
00:45:59.041 --> 00:46:00.390
what do you go up there?
I don't want,

693
00:46:00.391 --> 00:46:02.340
who wants that kind of stand up at this point?

694
00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.990
Like that kind of perfectly encompassed bumps,
severe of,
of your,

695
00:46:06.991 --> 00:46:10.140
of your persona so you can then sell it to NBC.

696
00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:15.290
I'm so past anger of being asked that question now for like so many years that

697
00:46:15.361 --> 00:46:18.740
now when I get asked,
I swear to you,
I just got asked.
So you're,

698
00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:21.150
you're a comedian.
Yeah.
And they're like,
what do you do?
I go,
I don't really know.

699
00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:26.910
By the way,
that is a true,
yeah.
And the perfect answer.

700
00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:29.580
I Dunno.
I Dunno.
I don't really know.
I don't really know what I'm doing.

701
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:34.740
I don't know what I'm doing.
98% of the time that good and I wouldn't go.

702
00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.700
It's weird that people let me still and um,

703
00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:42.740
I don't know why I've done it for so long and I wake up confused almost every

704
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:46.590
day.
Yeah.
All right.
And they'll probably be like,
me too.
We were like,
Oh red,

705
00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:50.250
what are you do Kevin?
What are you acting on these days?

706
00:46:50.251 --> 00:46:53.520
You're always acting on some nothing.
Why are you talking about,

707
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:59.190
Oh I think the last thing you liked masters of sex.
God Damn it.
And then I got,

708
00:46:59.220 --> 00:46:59.470
yeah,

709
00:46:59.470 --> 00:47:02.880
I fell out of it just cause we got so busy with the kiddos and life and stuff.

710
00:47:02.881 --> 00:47:07.080
But you're so fantastic on that.
That's nice of you.
Thank you.
Yeah,
thank you.

711
00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:10.300
You're done a bunch of cool stuff.
I'm lucky I've done I,
my,

712
00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:13.230
my look fits squarely into a category,

713
00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:17.750
so I've always been lucky that they need someone who looks like they can work on

714
00:47:17.751 --> 00:47:18.710
machine.
It is,

715
00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:22.440
it is weird to live in this town for this long and you're just flipping through

716
00:47:22.441 --> 00:47:25.030
channels.
Sometimes you're like,
Holy Shit,
I know that guy.
Yeah,

717
00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:29.680
like shows like Hey Scott.
Yeah.
Yeah it is.

718
00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:32.870
It's weird that like I don't watch any of my friends' shows and I'm like,

719
00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:36.910
it's just,
it's become all of our jobs.
So you're just like,
oh cool.

720
00:47:36.911 --> 00:47:39.730
Like I only know my friends are working when I called them.
They're like,

721
00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:43.690
I'm a New Mexico.
Like oh okay.
Like that's how you find out.

722
00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:47.200
She was doing something very rare that I've fallen in love with his show and I

723
00:47:47.201 --> 00:47:50.260
loved a masters of sex.
It was,
you know,

724
00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:53.740
objectively it was a like I can say like that was a very good show cause I

725
00:47:53.741 --> 00:47:57.220
wasn't there from like I started like halfway through the first season so I was

726
00:47:57.221 --> 00:48:00.490
able to watch it without me on it and a,
I was like,
Oh shit,

727
00:48:00.491 --> 00:48:01.870
these people are good.
I better try hard.

728
00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:05.550
And for those who don't know it's about Johnson and Johnson it now.
Yeah,

729
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:10.630
they studied people's sexual habits and such informed masters and Johnson

730
00:48:11.401 --> 00:48:11.950
masters in jobs,

731
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:14.470
but then it became Johnson and know that's something that's different people,

732
00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:19.720
whatever.
And by the way,
everyone does that,
but I googled it.
I fell and whatever,

733
00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:24.570
but they just pioneered sex research.
There you go.
They map the female orgasm,

734
00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:28.150
stuff like that.
So Nice.
Right down between the legs.

735
00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:32.290
That's the stuff that goes on.
I've heard about.
I flick it

736
00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:37.840
to check on
juvenile as we are.

737
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:42.640
Some guests come in here,
just turn you off right here now

738
00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:50.140
that's good too.
This is all good.
Stuff like that.

739
00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:54.070
And then you go like that.

740
00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:59.010
It's so similar to when a Nintendo game would freeze.
You just blow on it

741
00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:04.420
now.
Now do we get married?

742
00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:10.340
That turns you on so nasty to you.
Nasty.

743
00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:12.160
You love that Puerto Rican stuff.

744
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:16.810
My husband just did his first sentence Spanish last night and brand new.

745
00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:21.540
So I feel like I have like Rockin Espanol,
Csun,
Csun,

746
00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:26.650
young Spanish lover.
Now you should wait a minute.
You've never role played.

747
00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:30.280
You've had of Spanish speakers his entire time and I've never had him say,

748
00:49:30.281 --> 00:49:32.140
let's do this in Spanish.
I wish

749
00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:36.310
mature baby,

750
00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:40.320
least dose at least like hit her

751
00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:45.790
like standing naked in the corner.
What's the Mexican fantasy?

752
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:49.930
The Mexican fantasy.
We're predominantly Mexican.

753
00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:54.010
Like what's the Mexican fantasy for you?
What's the role?
Oh,

754
00:49:54.011 --> 00:49:57.970
you're obviously the lady at home and I'm like the gardening team and I just

755
00:49:57.971 --> 00:49:59.530
come over like this.
See,

756
00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:04.780
I know that seems like obvious some of your like racist assumptions.
But for me,

757
00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:06.970
what's August?
You're a successful,

758
00:50:06.971 --> 00:50:10.870
it's third generation business owner in America long enough.

759
00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:14.260
And then you get to play the role of like the poor white woman who's coming to

760
00:50:14.261 --> 00:50:15.940
you for help.
Whoa.

761
00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:19.880
You put her in a little jail jail.

762
00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:24.070
I liked the guys coming in all 30

763
00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:29.720
the code for the gate,
they can get in

764
00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:36.560
the sprinkler,
no working music.
My husband will be home soon and he's like,

765
00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:41.390
he's so gay.
I come fast.
That's not a good pitch.
I come fast.

766
00:50:41.391 --> 00:50:46.100
I can't be part of anyone's France.
Like there's a rush,
go,
go.

767
00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:51.140
And then he's like,
okay.
I mean,
or something like six guys come in.
Okay.

768
00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:55.070
It happens.
It's like every time you're facing away your heads,

769
00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:59.810
your head's in the trash.
And then every time I do a new accent,

770
00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:01.790
he keeps saying it's a different guy.

771
00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:06.290
Do you ever wonder what the small talk is like between guys at a gang?
Bang.

772
00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:11.030
Yeah,
yeah,
I do it.
There's no way.
There's none.
Right?

773
00:51:11.031 --> 00:51:15.520
He's gotta be so there's no way it's all about the gang bang.
Right.

774
00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:19.550
So at some point it's gotta be like,
maybe do you think there's like a circuit?

775
00:51:19.551 --> 00:51:22.900
We're,
those guys go to more than one.
So I was like,
Dude,
you're looking Jack,

776
00:51:22.901 --> 00:51:26.960
do you working out?
Like he notices definitely Steve Lost Weight.
You look great,

777
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:30.200
you look great.
I think there's things about shoes like,
oh yeah.

778
00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:35.090
Oh that's the big,
got a guest.
The floor slippery.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No,

779
00:51:35.091 --> 00:51:39.260
that's a big thing.
Like you were like,
that's why,
you know,
they're like,
hey man,

780
00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:42.500
you don't want to be walking around this site.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
You're right.

781
00:51:42.501 --> 00:51:44.090
You're right.
We should wear galoshes.

782
00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:49.280
If I even walked near a Gangbang set,

783
00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:54.310
I would have a hazmat suit this hoses out on like I'd walk in hoses on.

784
00:51:54.411 --> 00:51:55.310
It wasn't that crazy to have that.

785
00:51:55.311 --> 00:51:59.780
You're always all like you and all these guys kind of always stroking and

786
00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:03.370
talking.
You're like,
yeah,
yeah,
Lakers are fucked up this year.

787
00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:05.210
Hunt and you're just strolling in with Lebron.

788
00:52:05.211 --> 00:52:09.850
They got nothing out there like literally did not make the playoffs this year.

789
00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:14.240
One guy's got to work his nipples.
Yeah,
yeah.
Needs it.
He's got a job to do.

790
00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:17.000
That's right.
That's not really true.
Let's talk about your body.

791
00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:20.450
It's a perfect segue to his body.

792
00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:24.440
We were just talking about how much we hate our bodies and how everybody,
Hey,

793
00:52:24.441 --> 00:52:29.390
but even people with gray bodies or bodies almost like maybe they hate it more

794
00:52:29.391 --> 00:52:33.200
because they become more informed about what it could be and where they're at.

795
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:38.280
You hit yours too.
Oh,
oh girl.
See,
I look at yours.
I'm like,
this guy's got,

796
00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:42.500
he's got a
cool tattoo.
I've been trying,

797
00:52:42.501 --> 00:52:45.530
I've been trying now for six months.
Like,

798
00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:49.760
I just thought the other day I've been going to the gym five days a week,

799
00:52:49.761 --> 00:52:51.830
probably for six months just to look,

800
00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:56.860
just to still hate my body and only look okay from like 50 feet away in closing.

801
00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:03.320
That's not bad.
It's not bad,
but still closing over a certain age.

802
00:53:03.321 --> 00:53:04.220
That's the whole goal.

803
00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:07.940
You're never going to look good naked over for your doctor drew who like

804
00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:11.460
apparently well that you have to,
he's been doing,

805
00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:15.780
he is checked in a couple places.
Ah,

806
00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:19.190
good to see it.
David Goggins like that guy.
Like that guy is like

807
00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:25.540
former seal and fitness,
former yawn.
Um,

808
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:28.860
he runs like darker rules a day.
Fascinating.

809
00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:32.550
Like I learned so much at an early age from that show.

810
00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:37.550
Like any teenager love line level line because he grew up here in La and if you

811
00:53:38.221 --> 00:53:42.080
listened to k rock,
right?
Sunday nights.
Loveline was that Sunday night?
Yeah.
Yeah.

812
00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:47.370
Forman and doctor drew everything.
Uh,
but did you know that we have a podcast,

813
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:51.980
Dr drew after Dark Fridays at noon.
Oh,
okay.
Fun.
Be Fun.

814
00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:56.130
He's a smart guy and the like all those damn kids yet errors.
What?
Oh,

815
00:53:56.131 --> 00:53:57.580
Fridays at noon.
If those kids are like,

816
00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:01.750
we'll probably grown up now they are his children.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
How old are they?

817
00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:05.890
College age.
Weird.
Yeah.
How many are there?
Three.
Yeah.

818
00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:08.940
I had triplets.
Three to send to college at once.

819
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:14.280
I know it's crazy model sometimes too.
It gives you get extra money.

820
00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:19.530
If doctor drew became a male prostitute,
he'd do well.
Oh my God.

821
00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:23.760
He could do one of those themed cruises where like you go and you pay and you

822
00:54:23.761 --> 00:54:25.480
get to like rub oil on him.
Yeah.

823
00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:29.800
I feel like you know a lot about this.
Well,

824
00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:32.360
there's all those weird themed cruises now.
That's a great,
yeah.

825
00:54:32.361 --> 00:54:36.270
You guys can do a cruise.
This cruise.
The doctor drew oil crews.
I don't know.

826
00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:40.240
I made it up.
There's enough obscure cruises now to,
that would be a fine one.

827
00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:43.290
Do you want to rub oil on this guy?
There's like Star Trek cruises.

828
00:54:43.291 --> 00:54:45.360
I would rub oil on doctor drew would be my po.

829
00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:50.250
Who am I to not want to considering what he's given me and the rest of the world

830
00:54:50.251 --> 00:54:54.000
cause true am I haven't done anything to say I shouldn't be excited about

831
00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:56.640
rubbing some oil to make sure he doesn't get burned.

832
00:54:56.850 --> 00:55:01.830
He could be a prostitute for women.
Like real.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Both.
Yeah.

833
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:04.830
Both.
I wonder,
I'd love to see that.

834
00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:07.950
I would love to hear about this kind of standards.
What,

835
00:55:07.951 --> 00:55:12.951
what women stupid who want a male prostitute are looking for either west

836
00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:16.740
Juggalos.
No.
Well that's really good.
Is that a real thing?

837
00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:19.500
How bad is it?
Scripted or real?

838
00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:24.720
It's like a semi scripted but it's like it follows a real escort agency.
Oh Shit.

839
00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:27.850
Yeah.
But you can tell that the girls are looking,

840
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:30.540
so the website has different genres of dudes.

841
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:34.620
Like if you like the sensitive ponytail guy who says no mas de Yoga,

842
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:37.810
there's him,
there's the tech boy,

843
00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:42.630
Kevin Christie of the crew base.
And then there's a smart sensitive type,

844
00:55:42.631 --> 00:55:45.650
which is the Kevin Christie.
No boy

845
00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:49.800
cause it's worth it.
You guys hear the argument in my head,

846
00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:58.180
you guys think the sensitive guy is really just one of the hopes right there.

847
00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:03.360
John was he in that body is crazy.
Yeah,
but I,

848
00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:06.300
but he was on,
cause I follow him on Instagram.

849
00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:10.860
He was just on Instagram being like I'm on a new diet,
go to get my abs pop.

850
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:16.000
That's it from people I know who work out a lot to look like that your entire

851
00:56:16.321 --> 00:56:19.950
life.
It's a commitment.
It's not calling it and it's your job.

852
00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:24.790
You are pretty miserable all the time.
I mean I follow all these,

853
00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:27.070
my Instagram's sucks now because I fall a fitness thing.

854
00:56:27.071 --> 00:56:31.120
So like my explorer page is just fitness shit dude.

855
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:35.440
Cause it,
you know what it was,
I was in pain.
Like I have a weird back.

856
00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:38.470
The pain clinic.
Yeah.
And so I've just was like,

857
00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:42.760
I'm tired of hurting my back doing nothing.
So I was like,
maybe if I,

858
00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:46.930
if I exercise it'll get better and it has kind of yeah,
for sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.

859
00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:49.810
Cause as your,
where's your back page with lower back,
lower back pain.

860
00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:53.530
Like I hurt.
I hurt my back while ago.

861
00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:55.420
I don't even know what I did.

862
00:56:55.421 --> 00:56:59.410
It just all of a sudden it was like I heard a sound and I was like,
oh,

863
00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:00.273
here it goes a week.

864
00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:03.850
Like you lose a week or two of your life every time it happens and pass a

865
00:57:03.851 --> 00:57:05.230
certain age are like,
this is bullshit.

866
00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:08.650
I hurt my back playing football in fifth grade.

867
00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:13.960
Like I slipped the disc.
Yeah,
in fifth grade and I still,

868
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:19.420
yeah,
of course.
No.
I had went and got and Mris and everything and they're like,

869
00:57:19.421 --> 00:57:24.410
oh,
you have spot any live thesis of the fifth lumbar third degree and ever.

870
00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:26.170
I mean,
that means I'm 10 years old.

871
00:57:26.171 --> 00:57:28.000
I guess when that happened means you have to become a third degree.

872
00:57:28.001 --> 00:57:32.230
Black belt can fix it.
Oh Dude.
It's still,
are we taking taekwondo guys or what?

873
00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:36.670
Let's get it.
Let's do it.
It's still a gives me problems.
Valley taekwondo.

874
00:57:37.110 --> 00:57:41.290
Yeah,
yeah.
No,
it's Siri and you don't want to get back surgery.

875
00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:45.620
You want to avoid that shit at all costs that shits.
No.

876
00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:47.950
What I did was the doctor told me,
he's like,
you know,

877
00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:51.800
if you'll just like get fat and not work out.
Yeah,

878
00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:55.720
it'll be feel much.
Congrats on nailing that.
And he was like,

879
00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:57.550
then you'll feel better.

880
00:57:57.670 --> 00:58:02.670
I mean I spent so much time like hunched over a desk and I see what like old

881
00:58:02.831 --> 00:58:05.980
artists look like.
I was like,
I don't know if I want that.

882
00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:10.150
Like it just looks painful all cause I didn't realize every time you see an old

883
00:58:10.151 --> 00:58:13.360
person walking slow,
it's not that they're old.
They're in pain.

884
00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:15.850
Well missing head.

885
00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:20.680
You've seen that dude.
I saw a guy,

886
00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:25.660
this guy was walking in front of me.
I swear to you.
This guy,
this is real.

887
00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:30.260
Oh yeah,
the is bent.
So like hunt so bad.
The head's gone dude.
But this,

888
00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:33.610
I took this picture.
This isn't like from the Internet.
They're okay.

889
00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:37.640
That to me doesn't even look that bad luck.
Yeah,

890
00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:41.020
that's what I'm saying man.

891
00:58:41.021 --> 00:58:44.950
So bad that his low self esteem personified.

892
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:48.790
That's a,
that's a,
by the way let,

893
00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:51.220
that is a life of looking down so you don't want to face the world.

894
00:58:51.221 --> 00:58:52.190
Which I can understand.

895
00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:58.140
And then eventually over time he trained all his muscles to look down coupled

896
00:58:59.021 --> 00:59:02.500
with a few fifth grade football injury.
So there's no,

897
00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:06.590
there's no narcissists that are,
have that problem,
right?
No,
no,
no.

898
00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:10.090
Mom was good self esteem.
Nah,
I thought it was the iPhone.
Maybe he's using,

899
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:14.140
oh my friend Leslie told me that plastic surgeons are of having to fix,

900
00:59:14.410 --> 00:59:18.820
there's a new double Chin situation when people always looking down that people

901
00:59:18.821 --> 00:59:22.280
are always like this.
So there's a lot of people getting tightened up,

902
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:26.520
tightened up and you can't grow a beard like

903
00:59:28.270 --> 00:59:32.660
face banks.
I don't think I made that up.

904
00:59:32.661 --> 00:59:36.290
I think someone else do face banks are good.
Yeah.
I think with the tats though,

905
00:59:36.291 --> 00:59:39.260
how many of you got,
man,
have you ever wanted to get like a,

906
00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:42.560
like a white supremacist one and just see if you can get away with it?

907
00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:44.600
Wanted to get one.
You can't see my back

908
00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:49.880
because if you told me like I don't know what any of those are,

909
00:59:49.881 --> 00:59:53.180
you could tell me like,
you know,
Aryan Brotherhood.
It's cool man.

910
00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:55.700
Oh you don't know.
You know like the one that the secret ones,

911
00:59:55.701 --> 00:59:58.430
just like 13 words or whatever.
Right,
right.
The secret ones

912
01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:04.120
catch your,
just won't get them and also no wait.

913
01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:07.480
Tattooers won't do,
a lot of them will do them.
You got to like find,

914
01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:08.870
find like a brother.

915
01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:16.880
I got a guy,
I know a guy.
Oh yeah,
yeah,

916
01:00:16.881 --> 01:00:19.100
that'd be unfortunate.
When you have a change of heart,

917
01:00:19.210 --> 01:00:20.740
you know like you get out of the there,

918
01:00:20.741 --> 01:00:25.030
there's a program that actually were removed those for free.
Oh yeah.

919
01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:27.350
I watched the thing about it,
like how much to give them out.

920
01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:30.560
Gang gang members get out and they're like,
Hey,

921
01:00:30.561 --> 01:00:34.670
can you take this thing off my face?
Or like,
yeah,
we can't like swastikas.

922
01:00:34.671 --> 01:00:37.500
All kinds of just like that.
Could you imagine?
Oh Dude,

923
01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:41.330
I want to go back to this day.
I want to have those guys and be like,

924
01:00:41.331 --> 01:00:44.700

Really like put the swastika like,
well you're,

925
01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:49.050
you're in the day was you're in jail.
The ARYAN Brotherhood.

926
01:00:49.051 --> 01:00:52.310
It's like you're going to die if you don't do this and you're like,
fire it up.

927
01:00:52.311 --> 01:00:56.500
Here's a good spot right here.
Right in the Hindu,
it means peace,
right?

928
01:00:57.370 --> 01:01:00.110
Yeah.
Sorta,
Sorta,
sorta.
Also,

929
01:01:00.111 --> 01:01:04.700
there's this Chinese guy at lunch,
we need you to stab him in the,
yeah.
Okay.

930
01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:09.080
Welcome to the club.
We have jackets.
They still,
I mean,
I guess they still do,

931
01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:13.580
but of course they do.
I'm guessing there's a recent spike.

932
01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:19.220
Oh yeah.
But I actually,
I don't,
I,

933
01:01:19.221 --> 01:01:20.600
uh,
I mean I get it.

934
01:01:20.601 --> 01:01:22.850
You've got to have something to look forward to when you're locked up,

935
01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:26.970
but you gotta have you gotta fill the day.
Got To have some fun.
I really,

936
01:01:26.971 --> 01:01:27.980
if I went to prison,

937
01:01:27.981 --> 01:01:31.040
I realized that's a probably be how I would get by as tattooing people

938
01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:36.950
that would make keep me safe is like a good draw naked girls for people to jerk

939
01:01:36.951 --> 01:01:41.690
off to and staff's trail.
How terrifying is that day when like you're in prison,

940
01:01:41.691 --> 01:01:45.170
let's say you're in there for some bullshit and then they're like,
you're white,

941
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:49.310
you're in the brotherhood and you're like,
okay,
no,
you have to be like,
yeah.

942
01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.320
Basically you have to be like,
yeah.

943
01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.590
Or you have to like go to like the child molester wing to be safe.

944
01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:58.970
I don't want to do that.
No you don't.
Here's our brother.

945
01:01:58.971 --> 01:02:02.800
Kevin haven't go ahead and you're like,
well what about you?

946
01:02:02.801 --> 01:02:06.560
You got that sticky last name.
Oh I know,
but I'd be like,
no,
I'd be like,

947
01:02:06.561 --> 01:02:08.260
I would never let that out.
Now

948
01:02:10.690 --> 01:02:13.660
let's say they watch your act.
I love your stuff.
I wrote it.

949
01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:18.660
I took Spanish in high school man.
Look my blue eyes anyways.
Anyways,
yeah,

950
01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:21.450
yeah,
it'd be awful.
Yeah you get,
cause they would be like,

951
01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.460
that'd probably be the worst if they're like you're a happy,

952
01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.211
that's what I'm saying,

953
01:02:24.211 --> 01:02:27.660
cause you can't go with the Latins and you can't go with the Lens would not

954
01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:31.290
accept me for,
they would not let you in at all.
The white,

955
01:02:31.291 --> 01:02:33.030
the white guys would let me in for a while.

956
01:02:33.031 --> 01:02:36.120
Especially if like the thing is I could just go deep.
I'd be like fuck it.

957
01:02:36.121 --> 01:02:38.970
Spics and just keeps saying it.
And then you also have money,

958
01:02:38.971 --> 01:02:43.320
so like you could help their drug trade and you get a lot of money put on your

959
01:02:43.321 --> 01:02:47.070
book,
if you know what I'm saying.
Put on your book.
So you'd be,

960
01:02:47.071 --> 01:02:51.840
you'd be heavy with them.
Snacks
handing out those honey buns.
I don't mind.

961
01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:54.630
I don't mind man.
Sign me up in the women's prisons.

962
01:02:54.631 --> 01:02:57.620
Is it that I was not as hardcore?
No,
I don't think there's,

963
01:02:57.630 --> 01:03:00.690
I don't think there are.
There's gangs,
but I don't think there are.

964
01:03:00.691 --> 01:03:05.040
I don't think it's as,
they're not as violent either.
Sisera and all day.

965
01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:09.270
That's true though.
The documentaries.
I've seen women hookup quick.

966
01:03:09.271 --> 01:03:13.740
You get a prison wife,
your wife up to,

967
01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:17.330
I'd have to find a nice lady to take care of me and protect me.
Yeah.

968
01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:20.530
But they just,
yeah,
they just let bow out.

969
01:03:20.550 --> 01:03:23.410
You wouldn't want to turn it turn a bitch up though.
Yeah.

970
01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.910
I mean you want to be someone you want to get turned out.

971
01:03:26.911 --> 01:03:29.660
You don't want to like go in there kind of heavy and be like this is actually

972
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:33.150
going to be,
and then you pick one.
I don't know how I,
now I,

973
01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:34.980
I just tried to hide that thing where you,

974
01:03:34.981 --> 01:03:37.470
they talk about prison and they're like,
oh yeah,
you got to fight the first day.

975
01:03:37.471 --> 01:03:38.830
I'm like,
oh no.

976
01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:43.980
We're imagine like also the guys like you're beautiful code and you're like,

977
01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:48.570
I don't,
he's like,
yes,
we are.
All right.
Yeah.
I'm parties.
Like,
okay,

978
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:52.080
will you not beat me?
He's like,
yeah.
Like,
yeah.

979
01:03:52.081 --> 01:03:56.400
Like is it me?
Maybe he's gonna happen.
Right.

980
01:03:56.730 --> 01:04:01.590
So my rationale was like,
don't hit me in the face girl.
Like,
like,

981
01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:05.040
and let's,
let's come up with some rules.
Okay.
Here's a good question for you.

982
01:04:05.070 --> 01:04:08.100
Yeah.
You get to pick,
okay.
If you got to pick,
okay,

983
01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:10.410
there's some dicks coming into yourself.

984
01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:15.490
Want to get it right in the mouth or in the ass and the ass.

985
01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:20.550
Why?
Why in the ass?
Right up to see less of the dicks.

986
01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:25.350
It's less personal and your ass.
Yeah.
It's less personal in my butt.

987
01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.660
And you'd asked for a lube,
right?
Uh,
yeah.
I asked for it.
I would insist on it.

988
01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:34.140
And could you guys start off with some fingers,

989
01:04:34.141 --> 01:04:38.620
like kind of warn you that privilege in prison though these guys are picked,

990
01:04:38.850 --> 01:04:43.170
but you may get a nice neck rub.
Yeah,
true.
At the same time,

991
01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:46.170
uh,
bad though.
All bad.

992
01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:51.200
Also crazy that you also might get aids.
Yeah.
Maybe.

993
01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:54.810
How'd you get age?
Like these four guys?
Yeah.
No,

994
01:04:54.811 --> 01:04:58.680
but they could use the slim Jim condom where they just take the wrapper off the

995
01:04:58.681 --> 01:05:02.450
commissary to,
they're not going to use condoms.
No,
no,
no.
I didn't feel as good.

996
01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:05.920
Oh,
it feels good.
Especially the guy with age.
He's like,
I want to give this guys.

997
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:10.780
Yeah,
but what about these guys that are lifers?
Like,
you know,

998
01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:13.530
we've been watching love that that's who's doing it.
I know,

999
01:05:13.531 --> 01:05:18.531
but you'd think that the prospect of getting but sext but raped would,

1000
01:05:19.361 --> 01:05:21.880
um,
deter you from wanting to go back.

1001
01:05:21.881 --> 01:05:25.600
But apparently it's not that horrible if you keep going back and back and back.

1002
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:26.880
I mean it's,
it's,

1003
01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:31.510
I think some people are just used to the horror donated to that culture and that

1004
01:05:31.511 --> 01:05:33.070
becomes your lifestyle and you get good at it.

1005
01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:36.040
The real world's probably pretty terrifying if you've been presented for over 20

1006
01:05:36.041 --> 01:05:38.500
years.
Can you imagine going out there and like,
here's your smartphone.

1007
01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:41.880
Like it'd be awful,
truly awful.
And if you've developed some,

1008
01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:44.880
and it's not like you're going to get out of prison after 25 years and someone

1009
01:05:44.881 --> 01:05:46.870
was like,
here's your cool job.
No,

1010
01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.990
like your life is going to be a real bummer if you don't have a family that's

1011
01:05:49.991 --> 01:05:52.660
looking to help you,
you're fucked.
You know what I'm saying?

1012
01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:56.740
So you just do it.
You just pop a crime and go back.

1013
01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.990
It's violating parole is very easy.
It is.
And it,

1014
01:05:59.991 --> 01:06:03.610
at least you know what to expect in prison.
Yeah.
You know what the deal is?

1015
01:06:03.611 --> 01:06:06.310
You know how to get by.
You know how to survive in the real world.

1016
01:06:06.311 --> 01:06:10.090
Yet that becomes a world.
And you know how to navigate Getty Wednesdays.

1017
01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:14.230
Oh No.
I mean,
I don't know if that's a real thing,

1018
01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:17.890
but we gotta be Wednesdays are real.
It's is it okay?

1019
01:06:17.891 --> 01:06:21.580
Is it that far from elementary school?
If you just get to sleep there,

1020
01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:25.060
you slept in elementary school.
Look,

1021
01:06:25.090 --> 01:06:27.970
I lived in fear of violence in elementary school every day.

1022
01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.580
The food was terrible.
If I,

1023
01:06:29.590 --> 01:06:32.770
if they were just a cot and I only have one or two outfits.

1024
01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:36.850
How that's the difference.
My parents were kind of hands off anyway.

1025
01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:41.650
What city were you in?
La Crescenta.
Okay.
It was a nice helmet.
I don't know.

1026
01:06:41.651 --> 01:06:45.850
Prison has another level though.
Right?
But the handball tournaments,
we're cool.

1027
01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:51.190
Yeah.
And I would,
I'd have,
I would have gotten in shape so much earlier in life.

1028
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:55.870
Well,
that's what everybody says,
right?
You work out like crazy all this time.

1029
01:06:55.871 --> 01:06:57.970
But the nutrition's poor.
So I imagine

1030
01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:04.330
it's difficult when you're not eating well.
You're not on the Keto Diet.
Sure.

1031
01:07:04.331 --> 01:07:07.960
You're not getting enough protein.
But I mean,

1032
01:07:07.961 --> 01:07:10.970
you're working out a lot.
You are slim Jim.
You know,

1033
01:07:10.971 --> 01:07:14.380
you might actually get that body.
You've always wanted it in prison.

1034
01:07:14.381 --> 01:07:16.330
That's the big trade on both parties have always wanted.

1035
01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:18.190
I'd be in good enough shape to get a cute looking guy.

1036
01:07:18.191 --> 01:07:20.290
He's got a good body I've always wanted.
Yeah.
You know,

1037
01:07:20.350 --> 01:07:23.170
I can look at myself while I'm myself.
I wonder if you're like,

1038
01:07:23.171 --> 01:07:26.860
you would morph if you'd be like,
Nah,
I pretty much love guys.
You know?

1039
01:07:27.250 --> 01:07:31.510
I think the human brain's pretty malleable and you make the best out of where

1040
01:07:31.511 --> 01:07:35.230
you're at.
I think so too.
It's Steve,
someones hottest girl at the bank.

1041
01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:38.080
A cigarette.
If you work at a bank,

1042
01:07:38.081 --> 01:07:40.570
the hottest girl in the bank is the hottest girl in your entire world.

1043
01:07:40.571 --> 01:07:44.730
That's true.
And in prison world,
it's your world.
It becomes your world.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1044
01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:49.200
I believe it's called situational homosexuality.
Sure.
Oh,

1045
01:07:49.330 --> 01:07:50.890
I have been down that path.

1046
01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:57.280
You were saying earlier too,
you're like,

1047
01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:00.060
what would it be like if we were 20 years?

1048
01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:04.810
I imagine if I was young now would I have like face and neck tattoos?

1049
01:08:05.890 --> 01:08:09.310
Probably in today's world I started getting them in art school,

1050
01:08:09.311 --> 01:08:12.810
so I would be like,
how's how high up?
Do you have a tea?
Well,
I don't have any.

1051
01:08:13.030 --> 01:08:16.460
They're all in my arms to be fair.
I fucking despise getting them.

1052
01:08:16.461 --> 01:08:20.170
They're so painful.
I hate it.
Really?
Some people are like a dick.
I don't.

1053
01:08:20.190 --> 01:08:23.870
I think a,
that's bullshit.
And I also am not one of them.
Like they're like,

1054
01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:25.340
I love the paint.
I'm like,
oh cool,

1055
01:08:25.341 --> 01:08:28.250
can I poke you with a needle just because we're standing here like that seems

1056
01:08:28.251 --> 01:08:30.410
like bullshit,
but I hate,

1057
01:08:30.411 --> 01:08:33.110
that's why I don't have a big one because like I can hang in there like an hour

1058
01:08:33.111 --> 01:08:37.850
and a half,
two hours and then I'm like stop it.
Okay.
Oh it's awful.

1059
01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:40.040
After a while it gets a little less painful.

1060
01:08:40.250 --> 01:08:43.940
But you sweat because you can't move.
So you're just sitting there,

1061
01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:47.540
you're natural instinct to flinch.
You have to like word it the whole time.

1062
01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:50.960
They not give you any kind of pain blocker.
I don't know why.

1063
01:08:50.961 --> 01:08:54.380
It's like why don't they have topical anesthetic?
That's really,

1064
01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:56.300
really good question.
I'll put dude out man.

1065
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:59.510
Well cause they do for like removing moles and shit.

1066
01:08:59.511 --> 01:09:01.540
Like they just put a topic I get.
Yeah.

1067
01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:04.010
Every time I get something taken out of my face to give me a shot,

1068
01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.070
it doesn't hurt.
They saw it off with a razor blade.

1069
01:09:06.490 --> 01:09:10.280
So why am I sitting there pretending I'm like tough enough to be in a biker
gang?

1070
01:09:10.281 --> 01:09:13.800
Just cause I want something done.
Put on my arm.
I don't know.

1071
01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:19.010
Do you regret any,
any of them right now?
Yeah,
I have some regrets.
I have one.
Uh,

1072
01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:24.320
I regret this.
A Cleveland Brown's helmet.
Why do you have that?
I was a,

1073
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:27.350
I loved the Cleveland Browns for a little while when I liked it.

1074
01:09:27.351 --> 01:09:29.930
I just don't really like football anymore.
Oh really?
Yeah.

1075
01:09:30.170 --> 01:09:33.440
Just because of how it's evolved.
Yeah.
Is like,
as I've gotten older,

1076
01:09:33.441 --> 01:09:37.100
just like corporate sports,
he's just like,
yeah,
it's kind of gross.
How,

1077
01:09:37.610 --> 01:09:40.610
how big the corporation of the NFL is.
Yeah.

1078
01:09:40.611 --> 01:09:42.530
I just like what they do to the players,

1079
01:09:42.531 --> 01:09:45.240
the way the players are treated after the fact I don't like,
yeah.

1080
01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:48.920
You're just kind of abandon these people and you just embraced the browns at a

1081
01:09:48.921 --> 01:09:51.950
certain way.
We didn't,
we,
this was back when we didn't have a team here.
Right.

1082
01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:54.500
And it was the year the Brown's got their team back.

1083
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:57.920
I just thought it was like a nice,
I used to make some exciting moves,
man.
Yeah,

1084
01:09:57.921 --> 01:10:00.140
they did.
They did.
They did.
It doesn't matter to me,

1085
01:10:00.141 --> 01:10:04.510
but I know I'm going to probably turn that into a book or something.
Really?

1086
01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:07.700
I Dunno.
Something something funny.
They'll only tattoos.
To me,

1087
01:10:07.701 --> 01:10:10.670
the appeal at this point are like funny ones,
like something stupid.

1088
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:13.340
It'd be funny if you made an a that's taking a shit.

1089
01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:17.270
That'd be funny just to have on a flight and someone was like,
what's up dude?

1090
01:10:17.271 --> 01:10:19.260
You're like,
this is lady taking the very first.

1091
01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.880
The very first tattoo I got was from this guy I went to college with.

1092
01:10:22.881 --> 01:10:25.730
He worked at a tattoo shop and then I heard rumors that like,
oh yeah,

1093
01:10:25.731 --> 01:10:27.020
if you get a big one from him.

1094
01:10:27.021 --> 01:10:32.021
I heard he hides drawings of shit in it like as a prank and so I never went to

1095
01:10:32.091 --> 01:10:35.750
him when he would hide it for a while he was doing this thing where you could

1096
01:10:35.751 --> 01:10:36.590
come to them and get,

1097
01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:39.400
if you were willing to get a a Martini glass would shit in it.

1098
01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:43.370
He'd do it for free.
Oh my God,
that's great artist.
This guy mark hedge,

1099
01:10:43.371 --> 01:10:45.680
he could draw his fucking balls off.
He's,

1100
01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:48.110
I think he's still a tattoo artist in Detroit.
Is that by the way,

1101
01:10:48.111 --> 01:10:52.850
cause you're awesome artists.
Is that an innate,
do you figure it out young?

1102
01:10:52.890 --> 01:10:57.800
Yeah,
it is.
Right.
I was able to draw drawing at a young age and like Brian,

1103
01:10:57.830 --> 01:11:01.550
my cousin can really like just naturally withdraw,
you know,

1104
01:11:01.551 --> 01:11:02.510
a face and you're like,
wow.

1105
01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:05.600
And then I would draw and look like I dragged my feet or something.

1106
01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:08.030
It was just like,
yeah,
I could always kind of do it.

1107
01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:11.960
It's weird to me that people can't actually find it strange.

1108
01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:14.900
Well because like you guys can write letters,
you can learn,

1109
01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:16.680
you can make an r look like an r.

1110
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:20.220
And to me it's like the same thing kind of really.
But it doesn't,
you do.

1111
01:11:20.221 --> 01:11:23.550
Is there,
um,
have you ever seen like some of these hyper real,
yeah.

1112
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:28.230
Can you do that?
Yeah.
Really that's an issue of time.
Hyper realist.
They just,

1113
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:31.830
what they have as an a kind of patients.
That's insane.

1114
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:35.340
And a lot of you have to understand not to be addicted,
these people,
but a lot,

1115
01:11:35.341 --> 01:11:37.230
you know,
there's a lot of tricks to really,

1116
01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:41.550
well you use a graph or a projector to get like the base structure,
right?

1117
01:11:41.551 --> 01:11:45.720
And then you just spend,
oh it's a documentary called,

1118
01:11:45.721 --> 01:11:47.280
I think it's called finding Maryland.

1119
01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:52.140
It's about a guy who spent 10 years doing a hyper realistic portrait of Marilyn

1120
01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:55.770
Monroe.
And it was his big plan to become a famous artist.
And guess what?

1121
01:11:55.771 --> 01:12:00.630
It didn't work.
And I mean he p he drew it like less than an inch a day,

1122
01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:01.583
like a square inch.

1123
01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:06.360
And his big plan was he knew a guy who knew a guy that knew David Hockney and

1124
01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:09.330
see was going to show it to David Hockney and that was going to like start his

1125
01:12:09.331 --> 01:12:14.130
career.
He spent 10 years,
like 12 hours a day.
Well thought out.
No,
no,
no,

1126
01:12:14.131 --> 01:12:17.250
no,
no,
not at all.
Well thought out.
Good documentary though.

1127
01:12:17.530 --> 01:12:18.900
What else happens in prison by the way?

1128
01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:24.300
<v 8>I gave him the grease and I tell him now I'm on his finger</v>

1129
01:12:26.410 --> 01:12:28.570
sticking in his eighties and you know what I'm saying?

1130
01:12:28.571 --> 01:12:31.570
Kind of like fuck you sell to loosen yourself up.
Yeah.

1131
01:12:31.630 --> 01:12:34.270
Cause I know he ain't never been penetrated before.

1132
01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:38.710
It was just first time just the old penitentiary trick that I learned from some

1133
01:12:38.711 --> 01:12:42.550
old convicts.
If you scream rape,
you know what I'm saying?

1134
01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:46.870
He had grease on his fingernail so he agrees his own self up.

1135
01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:48.960
<v 6>Isn't that cool?
It's really interesting.</v>

1136
01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:54.260
That is equal parts romance and safe and thinking about your own safety.

1137
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:57.060
Yeah.
And engineer.
I mean think about what he's saying there.

1138
01:12:57.061 --> 01:13:00.920
For people who don't follow,
they,
they get a guy in a silo.

1139
01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:04.230
They tell him to put grease on his finger and stick it in his own ass.

1140
01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:07.230
And then if that guy was like,
those guys fucked me.
They're like,
Oh,

1141
01:13:07.231 --> 01:13:09.870
you've been greasing yourself up.
This dude not only planning,

1142
01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:15.200
he planted evidence and sensuality at the exact time and that is a rare person.

1143
01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:16.640
See what?

1144
01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:20.520
That's such a waste that that guy's in jail when he could be out running a

1145
01:13:20.521 --> 01:13:25.350
fortune 500 guy.
By the way,
I went into the vaults film studio.

1146
01:13:26.130 --> 01:13:26.431
I mean,

1147
01:13:26.431 --> 01:13:31.431
he has the mind of a Hollywood executive Weinstein Weinstein or this guy that

1148
01:13:31.771 --> 01:13:36.360
just got fired from Warner brothers.
He was,
he basically was like,
Hey,

1149
01:13:36.361 --> 01:13:40.890
I'll give you a part multiple.
It's in a movie,
this one lady,
and then they boned.

1150
01:13:40.891 --> 01:13:43.140
And then there was,
there's some hilarious text messages.

1151
01:13:43.930 --> 01:13:47.170
Those were great where she's like,
um,
you said you'd help me.
What?

1152
01:13:47.190 --> 01:13:50.410
Remember when you were inside me?
Like,
oh,
cool.
And then,
uh,

1153
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:54.370
did you see her music video?
No.
No.
It's really funny because,
uh,

1154
01:13:54.450 --> 01:13:58.980
I saw the article and I went to her video and then people were like,
pro tip,

1155
01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:04.040
hit mute on this video because it's just her like dancing around in lingerie and

1156
01:14:04.051 --> 01:14:06.360
her voice is horrible.
Right.

1157
01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:10.570
And that guy even references her video and one other texts too,
if,
yeah,

1158
01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:16.090
I don't understand why people that rich can't just go to escorts and stuff.

1159
01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:21.490
I know why toy was like starlets or how about this?
Why can't that dude,

1160
01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:26.850
who's the like just meet attractive women all the time and bone and like not

1161
01:14:28.061 --> 01:14:32.030
have it tied to an audition.
Partly.
How is it that,
cause it's not creepy.

1162
01:14:32.031 --> 01:14:34.860
It is not the pay off the field.

1163
01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:39.850
The power move of like the wind like Oh yeah you're you're so hot.

1164
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:44.200
Like you,
you need me.
Yeah.
I'm so cool that I've got,

1165
01:14:44.201 --> 01:14:45.550
but you're also so rich.

1166
01:14:45.551 --> 01:14:49.990
Can't you just impress people with your power by like going on a yacht that's

1167
01:14:49.991 --> 01:14:53.380
the ultimate rich guy pulled like want to go to Paris on our first date.

1168
01:14:54.010 --> 01:14:58.000
Like isn't that the move but you're that's like the kind of growing one has a

1169
01:14:58.001 --> 01:15:00.550
girlfriend.
He just wants to bounce.
Right Tom?
Yeah,

1170
01:15:00.551 --> 01:15:04.750
but I'm saying like good at all this stuff.
It all,
but I understand that too.

1171
01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:09.400
Like if you just want to bone also like that's what rich guys,
powerful guys do.

1172
01:15:09.401 --> 01:15:10.600
They're like I just want to bone.

1173
01:15:10.810 --> 01:15:15.810
And usually the influence of your power and money or enough to be able to bump

1174
01:15:17.710 --> 01:15:21.790
that would make actually me feel uglier that I know they own.

1175
01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:25.120
If she brought up like,
I'd love to get in that new movie,
I'd be like,

1176
01:15:25.121 --> 01:15:28.780
you don't really like me.
Yeah,
of course.
And that to me,
I,
it'd be,

1177
01:15:28.781 --> 01:15:30.910
I'd already be worried about that and be feeling that.

1178
01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:35.650
So the minute it got confirmed,
I'd be like,
you know,
thank you Max.
Able to,

1179
01:15:36.450 --> 01:15:38.470
I would have done this,
I would've done this different with this girl.

1180
01:15:38.850 --> 01:15:43.720
What I would've done is she had been,
she shows up and you're like,
yeah,
I'm down.

1181
01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:48.220
And you're looking at her and you're like,
let's do it.
She's like,
you know,

1182
01:15:48.221 --> 01:15:51.820
I really liked to be in a movie or something.
I'd be like,
well,
you know,

1183
01:15:51.821 --> 01:15:56.480
send me that,
uh,
that real on Monday.
And then you smash that night and she,

1184
01:15:56.490 --> 01:15:59.680
and you're like,
send me that real.
And then she sends the real and you're like,

1185
01:15:59.681 --> 01:16:01.240
yeah,
this could take some acting classes.

1186
01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:05.560
So you kind of like put her down and that makes her want to impress you more.

1187
01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:08.170
So there have been working on my acting classes and you're like,

1188
01:16:08.171 --> 01:16:12.370
how about those blowjob?
You were working on those.
And then she comes around,

1189
01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:16.450
polishes you off again,
send you another real and you're like,
yeah,

1190
01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:21.090
go back to class for both,
you know.
Have you ever thought,

1191
01:16:21.091 --> 01:16:25.330
have you ever thought of pitching to lifetime as a show?

1192
01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:29.980
Just like as a movie.
One of those like Christmas,
Walmart,
a word.

1193
01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:33.800
By the way,
the guy,
he's not like gross looking.
No,

1194
01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:38.200
he's like very handsome dude.
Yeah.
Well put together.
I'll put together,

1195
01:16:38.210 --> 01:16:42.460
look like he was in good shape.
Beautiful Skin.
Like what exactly?
Best Diet.

1196
01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:44.000
I fuck the,

1197
01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:48.540
I would fuck the Warner Brothers Guy 10 times before I Fuck Tattoo guy.
Yeah,

1198
01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:52.330
but here's the deal.
Here's where she messed up.
There it is.
Oh yeah,

1199
01:16:52.331 --> 01:16:57.070
he's a cute little now he's cute.
Yeah,
me.

1200
01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:00.250
This guy can't find my,
she messed up.

1201
01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:03.910
The whole always takes the money first.

1202
01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:10.740
You don't give it up and then expect the guy to pay he to pay first and then you

1203
01:17:11.121 --> 01:17:12.330
give up the goodies.

1204
01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:15.340
Paul says half the money before I leave the house house to Miami,

1205
01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:18.830
La second hat before I go on stage.
Okay.
That's what I'm talking about.

1206
01:17:18.831 --> 01:17:22.010
So she fucked up her damn self.
You fucked up your money.
That's right.

1207
01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:24.830
You can take a business course.
That's right.
You get the,
you get paid.

1208
01:17:24.831 --> 01:17:29.180
You could put,
hey
stupid.

1209
01:17:29.181 --> 01:17:32.840
That's her fault.
Listen,
if you're going to be a hoe,
at least get the shit first.

1210
01:17:32.841 --> 01:17:36.930
And then she was like texting like you remember when you were inside of me and

1211
01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:40.340
hilarious.
Hilarious.
I just,

1212
01:17:40.341 --> 01:17:45.341
it baffles me that these rich guys can't figure out a way to get to get this.

1213
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:47.480
I mean,
like I said,
I probably a lot of them can,
you know,

1214
01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:51.110
there's the ones that get caught.
You're like,
you dork.
It's always dorks.

1215
01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:55.310
Always Dork.
He's a door.
They cannot dorks dorks.

1216
01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:59.930
We're not prepared for.
And shame.
There's enough young,

1217
01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:05.020
attractive chicks out there who just want to be in that scene and words.

1218
01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:10.690
The jet setting party scene who are not like,
I'm a,
I am trying to act.
Oh,

1219
01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:15.080
without a tradition.
That's who you should be with men.

1220
01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:20.060
Here's what the girl you need the girl who just wants handbags and shoes to go

1221
01:18:20.061 --> 01:18:24.410
to the elite party.
You know what the problem is?
He's so rich.

1222
01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:29.150
He lives in hangup,
hangs out in a group and in an areas where those,

1223
01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:31.850
he can't find women that are just stoked to on what he has.

1224
01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:36.880
And in pray you're around people who standards are so high that unless you're

1225
01:18:36.921 --> 01:18:39.590
getting them a movie,
he's only meeting actresses.

1226
01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:44.570
The only young and an old rich guy always wants a woman that's too hot and too

1227
01:18:44.571 --> 01:18:45.404
young for him.

1228
01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:49.170
And the only women like that he's meeting are actresses that's put,

1229
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:52.760
that becomes his thing.
Like those are the ones these aiming at.

1230
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:56.510
They always want something to,
yeah,
the wants gotta be very low.

1231
01:18:56.511 --> 01:19:00.030
It's like the manager dating the client can,

1232
01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:03.920
that's a bad thing.
You don't want the person wanting from you.

1233
01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:08.550
It's so weird.
No,
I'm drinking my water.
Thank you.
Open.

1234
01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:10.910
It is already finished.
Mine's already been open.

1235
01:19:10.911 --> 01:19:15.650
It's already been drank from go get your own water.
No you cannot.
Come on.

1236
01:19:15.651 --> 01:19:20.220
I'm so thirsty.
Give her some water.
I know.
He's so selfish.
Jesus.
You only,

1237
01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:24.530
wow.
Wow.
But now it's got an impressive,
so you didn't finish it.

1238
01:19:24.531 --> 01:19:28.700
You Bitch ass nothing.
There's two sips in there.
That's why he drinks that.

1239
01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:33.020
That's why he took it.
Cause it's not even really drinking water.
It's two sips.

1240
01:19:33.090 --> 01:19:36.160
You're so selfish data.

1241
01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:40.040
The collection that is the opposite of a finger with grease on it.

1242
01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:43.970
Kevin,
you're a lady now.

1243
01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:49.020
You ever been angry at your lady for her being too cold and needing to turn the

1244
01:19:50.691 --> 01:19:54.700
heat on?
Stupid though?
Look,

1245
01:19:54.710 --> 01:19:59.710
there is clearly a temperature difference in every couple and every one was a

1246
01:20:00.981 --> 01:20:05.750
fucking stupid Jesus.
Can you hear that accent?
What's going on,

1247
01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:10.440
professor?
Oh
the professor from Gilligan's island.

1248
01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:18.390
But yeah,
for some reason I,
I've never been the same temperature as anyone.

1249
01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:22.170
And you run hot or do you run good?
I think,

1250
01:20:22.171 --> 01:20:26.780
I think I will.
I'd never,
I sleep and just underpants.
Yeah.

1251
01:20:26.930 --> 01:20:30.120
So we would go,
we would be good.
Bunkies

1252
01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:35.340
I will say the only thing that bothers me is when someone's like how the air and

1253
01:20:35.341 --> 01:20:36.900
you look over and they're just sweated up.

1254
01:20:36.901 --> 01:20:40.650
Like they have sweatpants on sweat shirt on in bed under a cover and I'm like

1255
01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:44.660
take some of your rope as off and remove Europa's yeah.

1256
01:20:44.910 --> 01:20:46.680
Do you have on [inaudible] right now?

1257
01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:51.450
Remove the cow and then we'll talk temp.
Well,
here's mine.

1258
01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:55.830
Here's my point.
We were at an outdoor restaurant,
patio dining.

1259
01:20:55.860 --> 01:21:00.650
Why?
Well it was,
it was,
it was a nice day out.
Okay.
Oh,

1260
01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:05.580
during the evening was upon you and they had a heat lamp and I was nice and

1261
01:21:05.581 --> 01:21:08.550
toasty under there and he was p became slowly and rage.

1262
01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:11.813
However,

1263
01:21:12.630 --> 01:21:17.430
let the record show that Mr [inaudible] was wearing a hooded sweatshirt and

1264
01:21:17.431 --> 01:21:21.680
could have removed the layer.
Got To remove your layer.
But no,

1265
01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:26.340
I don't because listen,
she had them,
we'll over.

1266
01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:27.930
It wasn't necessary.

1267
01:21:28.210 --> 01:21:31.920
The sweatshirt was appropriate for the natural temperature.

1268
01:21:32.190 --> 01:21:37.190
She's like wheel that over and you know it has settings basically cranked all

1269
01:21:37.381 --> 01:21:40.950
the way full crank it all the way to anchor my husband.
Yeah,
Dude.
Like it's like,

1270
01:21:40.951 --> 01:21:45.000
it's 20 degrees outside.
So then I'm like,
just turn that down.
It's ridiculous.

1271
01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:48.060
Take your sweatshirt off.
No,
turn the oven off.
Right.

1272
01:21:48.061 --> 01:21:52.470
There's no point in horseshoe booth.
Right.

1273
01:21:52.471 --> 01:21:55.350
And he was sitting next to me in the sweatshirt.
So I said,

1274
01:21:55.351 --> 01:21:57.000
okay then just as word islands

1275
01:22:01.130 --> 01:22:03.320
or go over here instead of cross.

1276
01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:07.410
But isn't this such a beautiful testament to your relationship,

1277
01:22:07.411 --> 01:22:10.350
but these are your problems I guess.
Yeah.

1278
01:22:10.530 --> 01:22:15.530
These are not big bays are not watch one episode of cops.

1279
01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:19.090
Right.
It's like he took a shit in my car.
I'm like,

1280
01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:21.870
these things could be way worse.
That's true.

1281
01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:26.730
I told him to get new needles and he did it and fucking dirty ass needles.

1282
01:22:26.731 --> 01:22:30.570
Now I got HIV mother fucker.
I'm like,
there are people,

1283
01:22:31.950 --> 01:22:35.430
that's true.
He hits my kid but I can't hit his kid

1284
01:22:37.410 --> 01:22:38.370
when they do the same.

1285
01:22:38.371 --> 01:22:42.180
They were both setting fires in the backyard and I slapped mine in fucking then

1286
01:22:42.181 --> 01:22:45.870
he slapped my butt.
I can't slap Hez cause she blind.

1287
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:49.300
There could be many worse things.

1288
01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:53.760
Do you hate your woman for her temperature needs?
Very rarely.
I mean,

1289
01:22:53.761 --> 01:22:56.700
and she sleeps nice and heavily.
So when I like,

1290
01:22:57.030 --> 01:23:00.180
you know when you're like leap out of bed off,
that's like adjuster.
We're like,

1291
01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:04.080
motherfucker like she doesn't notice so I don't get held accountable for that

1292
01:23:04.081 --> 01:23:07.810
angle.
If you were to drive faster than she likes.

1293
01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:12.250
That only happened once and I slowed down.
You slept.
Oh,
interesting.

1294
01:23:12.490 --> 01:23:16.810
You didn't tell me the sooner I didn't get angry at her because the wait,

1295
01:23:16.811 --> 01:23:20.800
what did you do?
I don't remember.
I think I just,
I think,
I probably guess,

1296
01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:25.670
I think I just going away on ramp and you're like,
oh,

1297
01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:30.690
we can't do fifth 46 and a 35 I think I just maybe made a turn.

1298
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:34.000
I,
you know,
I overestimate my own reflexes.

1299
01:23:34.001 --> 01:23:38.380
I think I make left turns a little closer to a car coming towards us and she'd

1300
01:23:38.381 --> 01:23:42.050
prefer,
because again,
she's passenger side,
so if we get broad sided,

1301
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:46.720
Kevin walks away,
dead girlfriend.
So I think she was just like,
oh,

1302
01:23:46.721 --> 01:23:49.470
like a little like that.
And I was like,
oh,
I want to do that.
I just didn't,
I,

1303
01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:52.680
there's very rarely anyone in my car.
She was like,
don't do that.
Yeah.

1304
01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:54.600
She didn't even have to say,
don't do that.
The,
the,

1305
01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:57.430
the visual of her grabbing the door.
It wasn't enough to me be like,

1306
01:23:57.580 --> 01:24:01.270
don't do that.
I didn't do anything like that.

1307
01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:04.900
He made have you made a left turn very quickly?

1308
01:24:04.901 --> 01:24:09.370
You accelerated into the turn and then he did 46 and a 35 you were going very

1309
01:24:09.371 --> 01:24:12.580
fast and I had to hold onto the handle.

1310
01:24:14.190 --> 01:24:14.960
<v 9>Oh,
you'll</v>

1311
01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:17.750
<v 6>add to hold on and brace myself.
Well look,</v>

1312
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:21.590
if you're going to get a car that he bought a fancy car that's fast.

1313
01:24:21.591 --> 01:24:24.060
You got to a Jeep Cherokee.

1314
01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:30.390
But here's the,
here's the deal man.
Those are quick mom card.

1315
01:24:30.410 --> 01:24:33.710
You know the problem with a Jeep Cherokee is they feel kind of loose cause

1316
01:24:33.711 --> 01:24:36.320
they're up a little higher like shocks.
When when the,

1317
01:24:36.321 --> 01:24:38.310
when the Jeep Cherokee takes off,
you feel like you're,

1318
01:24:38.311 --> 01:24:40.730
you're on a roller coaster a little bit.
I like it.
Okay.

1319
01:24:40.970 --> 01:24:43.550
But there's like someone likes living dangerously when she's in charge.

1320
01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:47.180
Thank you Kevin.
Again,
this is,

1321
01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:53.390
I think the point you're really trying to make
the Kevin,

1322
01:24:53.391 --> 01:24:58.250
he got angry with me for feeling the fear for expressing the fear.
Oh,

1323
01:24:58.251 --> 01:25:01.820
see I don't,
you can't get out.
You can't get angry with how someone feels.

1324
01:25:01.821 --> 01:25:05.390
You can get angry with how they react to that feeling.
Yeah.

1325
01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:10.400
I don't think you agreed with what I just said.
I think he's just said.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1326
01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:17.830
Are you adjusting a fantasy team on your
like

1327
01:25:19.370 --> 01:25:22.190
10 times a day?
Oh,
for fuck's sake.

1328
01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:27.220
So there's this a news piece we wanted to just show you couldn't believe this

1329
01:25:27.261 --> 01:25:30.870
made it into the news.
I got a screen in front of me with your two screens.

1330
01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:32.121
I remember,

1331
01:25:32.121 --> 01:25:37.121
I remember you guys just hosting it like the Irvine Improv for some Shitbox,

1332
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:40.190
you know,
showcase.
Everyone was poor.

1333
01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:45.110
The parking lot at the comedy store is so funny to me now.
Just like Tesla,
Tesla,

1334
01:25:45.111 --> 01:25:47.000
Tesla,
port port,
Fourchon corvette,

1335
01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:51.200
what are used to be just like someone getting walking.
They're like,

1336
01:25:51.290 --> 01:25:54.410
whose bike is that?
I love it though.

1337
01:25:54.411 --> 01:25:57.960
It's quite hilarious watching someone get rich from talking about there.
But

1338
01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:04.760
my favorite like crazy.
No know,
but like crushers,
gold,

1339
01:26:04.761 --> 01:26:05.600
Rolex.
I just,

1340
01:26:05.630 --> 01:26:08.900
I just think it's a butthole Rolex cause he literally got a gold Rolex talking

1341
01:26:08.901 --> 01:26:12.980
about a particular lot of shoots.
I go,

1342
01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:17.540
I was like,
dude,
you paid for that talking about your Dick and nuts and pass.

1343
01:26:17.541 --> 01:26:21.310
And he goes,
Ooh,

1344
01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:27.190
talk about wanting to put oil on somebody's.
Okay,
rob,
you're on your man.

1345
01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:33.440
<v 10>Good.</v>

1346
01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:37.910
<v 11>Good Morning Julia.
This is your why m h exclusive Florida man report.</v>

1347
01:26:38.450 --> 01:26:41.930
I'm your host Pete Melfi and I'm someone who slowly letting go of the delusional

1348
01:26:41.931 --> 01:26:44.540
reasons why I even bothered manscaping anymore.

1349
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:47.630
Our final story tonight for demand,
Brett Krishna,

1350
01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:51.740
who is widely known as a racist and child Predator and it's also fat as fuck

1351
01:26:51.741 --> 01:26:52.970
balloon to his highest weight ever.

1352
01:26:52.971 --> 01:26:56.870
This week we reached out to Mr Kremlin for comment and his response was,
quote,

1353
01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:58.850
I can't talk right now.
I'm eating.

1354
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.780
He then humbled illegible words with his mouth full and ended the call by going

1355
01:27:02.781 --> 01:27:06.440
on an antisemitic rants about how the Jews are suppressing.
His number's on here.

1356
01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:09.740
That's about all the time we have left for today.

1357
01:27:09.741 --> 01:27:14.060
Remember to get your Florida man updates by following on social media at fl.
Man,

1358
01:27:14.061 --> 01:27:18.710
report this on me.
Beat me.
I'm home here now.
Until next time.

1359
01:27:18.711 --> 01:27:21.170
This is Pete Melfi saying try it out.

1360
01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:26.580
<v 6>Wow.
That was a nice man.
Burn the news.</v>

1361
01:27:28.290 --> 01:27:32.150
It seems like all his fat goes forward but not sideways.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1362
01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:36.890
So from the right angle,
you're like,
like I go more sideways than forward.

1363
01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:40.570
He's an alcoholic and that's it.
Easy on it.

1364
01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:44.400
Why is that common?
Yeah,
I thought that's more of his brand.
It's fine.

1365
01:27:45.390 --> 01:27:49.960
It's totally fine.
Can you imagine if he was sober and still looked in back at?

1366
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:54.150
No.
No,
because when he doesn't drink,
he's,
he leans out pretty quick.
Right,
Tom?

1367
01:27:54.290 --> 01:27:57.420
I mean it's really,
it's wild.
He has one of those by,
you know,

1368
01:27:57.421 --> 01:28:01.900
it looks like a car,
like a manatee swelling up and it's almost like if you were,

1369
01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:04.230
he died a month ago.
Yeah,
it does.

1370
01:28:04.730 --> 01:28:09.730
It looks like a dead person and then he can literally eat clean and sober for a

1371
01:28:12.090 --> 01:28:16.800
week and dropped like 15 pounds.
Amazing.
Yeah.
And you think you would?
Yeah,
it's,

1372
01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:22.040
it's,
it's self imposed
again.
I,

1373
01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:24.870
but I will say when I go to my gym,
I don't know,

1374
01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:27.870
I'm usually there with a bunch of other men in their forties and there's a look

1375
01:28:27.871 --> 01:28:31.730
on all our faces,
like,
why are we doing?
Like,
what are we training for?

1376
01:28:31.950 --> 01:28:35.670
War Can we were just talking about like it's just the state of hiring.

1377
01:28:35.730 --> 01:28:40.730
Like not the person that pretends the person who is really like I'm fine with

1378
01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:43.860
with what I got.
That's fine.
Yeah.

1379
01:28:43.870 --> 01:28:48.180
I think it's just the like I don't want to have to make fashion decisions based

1380
01:28:48.181 --> 01:28:53.140
on yes,
bad.
Like when I started having to buy new pants then you're like,
oh man,

1381
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:55.860
some depressing.
Very depressing.
Like when you're giving away clothes.

1382
01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:59.730
I went and bought jeans once and there's this Eh,
this company where you could,

1383
01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:02.610
you could return your cool looking beat up jeans.

1384
01:29:02.610 --> 01:29:03.900
They give you half off a new pair.

1385
01:29:04.230 --> 01:29:06.810
And I was returning a pair and getting a sense of,
because yeah,

1386
01:29:06.811 --> 01:29:09.180
most people were turning for this reason.
I was like,
what do you mean?
He goes,

1387
01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:11.640
oh just like dudes in their late thirties who have like,
you know,

1388
01:29:11.641 --> 01:29:16.490
need a bigger sign.
He just said we're at all.
Cause I was like,
yeah,
I need to,

1389
01:29:16.491 --> 01:29:19.740
I think I need a 34 and the ones I was turning and we're like a 31

1390
01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:25.180
oh,
so you've given up.
Yeah.
But I agree.

1391
01:29:25.181 --> 01:29:27.310
Like I've resigned to the fact that my body's,

1392
01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:31.740
I'm never going to look the way I did in my twenties but I don't like that

1393
01:29:31.741 --> 01:29:35.170
decision too of having to dress around your fat.
That's worse.

1394
01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:38.250
I've realized I've never gonna like possess agility.

1395
01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:43.060
Like I can't do like physical things.
Like I see people,

1396
01:29:43.090 --> 01:29:47.430
Jim like jumping off on a box and I'm like,
no ma'am,
no ma'am.

1397
01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:51.420
But if I could just like not have my pants hurt,

1398
01:29:52.710 --> 01:29:56.400
I don't want my clothes to hurt.
Yeah.

1399
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:58.103
Cause I don't.

1400
01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:01.350
The other day I was like picking something up and I made a noise and I,

1401
01:30:01.351 --> 01:30:04.800
and I thought to myself,
I don't even know that I need to make a noise.

1402
01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:09.660
I just now do it.
But like when I bend over to pick up a quarter,

1403
01:30:09.661 --> 01:30:14.661
I go and I don't even know if I'm feeling that noise or I'm just now,

1404
01:30:14.821 --> 01:30:19.170
that's the what I do when I pick something up.
I don't even know if it hurts.

1405
01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:24.640
You know what?
I don't,
I don't want to run up the stairs and feel that tire.
Yeah.

1406
01:30:24.810 --> 01:30:26.690
That's the one I,
that's not like,
oh,

1407
01:30:26.691 --> 01:30:29.650
I'm sure I don't want to die of a heart attack and a staircase.
That too.

1408
01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:34.900
That'd be bad.
Yeah.
I also don't want boobs Gig.

1409
01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:40.080
Get a Bra.
I don't want to like,

1410
01:30:40.081 --> 01:30:44.010
I don't want,
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm vain,
I guess.
Yeah,
we all are.

1411
01:30:44.970 --> 01:30:46.290
Yeah.
And I,
you know,

1412
01:30:46.770 --> 01:30:50.670
it definitely looked worse than you look worse than when you're young.

1413
01:30:50.671 --> 01:30:54.300
I don't care what you're doing and your face is your face and your elbow.

1414
01:30:54.301 --> 01:30:57.990
Skin tells the truth so you can't,
there's certain parts of your body like,

1415
01:30:57.991 --> 01:31:00.630
I don't care.
I go to the gym every day for the next four years.

1416
01:31:00.810 --> 01:31:03.120
There's still gonna be parts of my butter.
Like,
what's up dude?

1417
01:31:03.121 --> 01:31:07.380
Who's in his forties for sure.
Like I don't care.
And let's,
let's be honest,

1418
01:31:07.381 --> 01:31:10.680
your Dick is just a fucking lie detector tests all the time.

1419
01:31:11.970 --> 01:31:16.530
Your junk tells your age.
Yeah.
No one has new looking nuts.

1420
01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:17.730
Like you can't,
there's no,

1421
01:31:17.731 --> 01:31:20.730
there is literally not a machine at the gym to tightens up your scroll.

1422
01:31:20.970 --> 01:31:24.000
That's true.
No Way.
That just looks tar up,
right baby.

1423
01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:28.630
Two babies and it does not look the same as it did years ago,

1424
01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:34.740
but looks alone is terrifying.
It looks nice.
Extra parts to it now.
No,
no,

1425
01:31:34.741 --> 01:31:37.250
no.
It looks nice.
It doesn't look.
It does look nice.

1426
01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:40.310
I'll settle this show.

1427
01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:44.100
If you were Puerto Rican,
she'd fucking drop her pants right now.

1428
01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:48.480
Is that a real thing?
You have a thing.
Puerto Rican.
What about them?

1429
01:31:50.210 --> 01:31:54.690
I like the way they want in life.
No,
I liked the culture.

1430
01:31:54.691 --> 01:31:57.700
I like their swag.
I liked the aesthetics.

1431
01:31:57.830 --> 01:32:02.480
The by Londo that constant by launching the byline.
Living lives.

1432
01:32:02.490 --> 01:32:05.680
Yeah.
I don't have any exposure to Puerto Rican men.

1433
01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:08.890
I don't know how they're the best.
Go to Miami,
Bro.

1434
01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:12.700
I went to Miami once and let me tell you about who hated it.
This guy,

1435
01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:16.270
there's nothing I,
I as far as like not your jam is,

1436
01:32:16.271 --> 01:32:20.430
you could not pick a place less than I'd want to go to.
I could see that.
Yes.

1437
01:32:20.630 --> 01:32:24.490
I could see you hating.
Oh,
Vegas sucks.
I liked,

1438
01:32:24.491 --> 01:32:27.940
actually I kind of like Vegas in my twenties because I like playing blackjack.

1439
01:32:28.030 --> 01:32:29.410
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1440
01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:34.500
And like I was young enough to where strip clubs didn't make me sad over a

1441
01:32:35.171 --> 01:32:37.060
certain age.
You,
I could not,

1442
01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:40.450
I couldn't separate myself from like the sadness of a,

1443
01:32:40.630 --> 01:32:45.280
of a strip joint past like 26 I was like,
ah,
that bruise looks,

1444
01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:49.730
do you ever go and do you ever try to go make them sad?
Come,
I

1445
01:32:51.610 --> 01:32:56.140
can't be that hot.
Just telling them about my girlfriend's job and she's like,

1446
01:32:56.141 --> 01:32:58.900
hey.
And you're like,
why are you doing this?
Yeah,
when she's like,

1447
01:32:58.901 --> 01:33:01.240
just putting myself through school and I'm like,
are you though,

1448
01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:06.650
like how long have you been saying like,
are you really going to be a nurse?
Yeah,

1449
01:33:06.850 --> 01:33:10.840
I don't think so.
I feel like you're not used to normal hours.

1450
01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:14.710
Like imagine how low somebody has to go to do what you're doing.
Yeah.

1451
01:33:14.770 --> 01:33:16.600
Like let me ask you this,
cinnamon,

1452
01:33:16.601 --> 01:33:20.980
is this the last rung on the ladder or do you feel like there's one below this?

1453
01:33:21.850 --> 01:33:22.840
I used to always think about,

1454
01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:27.220
not so much now because pornography is so such a huge business,

1455
01:33:27.221 --> 01:33:31.210
but in the 90s like people getting turned away from doing porn.
Imagine that day.

1456
01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:36.270
I know.
I'm like,
Hey,
I'm here.
Let's do this.
They're like,
Eh,
I don't know.

1457
01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:41.200
Yeah,
you can come on my face.
Yeah.
And they're like,
we don't want to though.

1458
01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:45.160
Oh God,
that'd be a whore.
You're not good enough.

1459
01:33:45.310 --> 01:33:49.420
They're all those documentaries in the 90s about like getting cast as a porno.

1460
01:33:49.450 --> 01:33:52.870
You had to actually try out for things.
I wonder if that's still a rule.

1461
01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:56.440
I don't know.
I feel like,
but now with the Internet though,

1462
01:33:56.530 --> 01:33:58.240
anyone can upload their own thing,

1463
01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:00.550
so maybe somebody else doesn't want to put you in something,

1464
01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:04.330
but you can record and be like,
Hey,
here's my,
I hate amateur porn.

1465
01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:07.540
Really what I want to watch high school basketball.

1466
01:34:08.170 --> 01:34:12.790
Fucking sucks dude.
Then I will say the nice thing about porn on night,

1467
01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:16.180
last 20 years is the guys finally got in shape.
Oh yeah.

1468
01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:18.940
Cause they looked so gross.
It was just not believable.

1469
01:34:18.941 --> 01:34:21.910
Like no one's fucking that guy.
Give a,
do you have a genre?

1470
01:34:21.911 --> 01:34:25.590
You get into uh,
enthusiasm.
Yeah.

1471
01:34:26.770 --> 01:34:27.590
That's sad.

1472
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:31.590
<v 3>Just like the third technique is called mouthwatering good.
This tech,</v>

1473
01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:34.040
they can each blow job because it's very important.

1474
01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:36.650
This is what you're going to do is you're going to take his penis and push as

1475
01:34:36.651 --> 01:34:41.651
far back in your throat that you can to gag when you gag the mouth waters and

1476
01:34:41.721 --> 01:34:45.260
your eyes here.
This allows you to know that you're doing it correctly.

1477
01:34:45.261 --> 01:34:47.380
This is a bummer.
That's what bums me out.

1478
01:34:49.310 --> 01:34:50.480
I've heard of that lady.

1479
01:34:51.550 --> 01:34:53.440
<v 6>She did our podcast,
uh,
years ago.</v>

1480
01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:56.620
I mean I'm glad she's out there doing it but also don't.

1481
01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:01.790
So no amateur stuff for you.
Nah,
I don't.

1482
01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:05.660
The lighting is terrible.
There's always like one angle and by the way,

1483
01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:09.500
you want to talk sad.
These apartments they live in.
That's actually the thing.

1484
01:35:09.501 --> 01:35:11.030
It'll take me out during the day.

1485
01:35:11.031 --> 01:35:14.190
So there's a blanket over the window and you're just like,

1486
01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:19.160
you see like the stack of DVDs and you're like,
why are you still have DVDs?

1487
01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:20.450
It's never,

1488
01:35:20.450 --> 01:35:25.070
I never feel like amateur porn is the woman's idea on any level.

1489
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:29.240
It's always a dude who's dating a girl too hot for him.
And he's like,
come on,

1490
01:35:29.241 --> 01:35:33.700
I'll be so rad.
And then 11 years later when it's still on the Internet,

1491
01:35:33.701 --> 01:35:37.550
this poor lays like God damn.
Cause you imagine just watch him.

1492
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:41.840
They always have the worst tan lines.
Like the dude's,
there's no,
there's no care.

1493
01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:45.680
There's just no care and anything about them.
Their pubic hairs,

1494
01:35:45.681 --> 01:35:50.120
a descent amateur stuff too is like the guy really doesn't know what he's doing.

1495
01:35:50.150 --> 01:35:54.590
He has a row mediocre Dick.
He can't fuck well,
doesn't know about angles.

1496
01:35:54.591 --> 01:35:56.870
He's certainly,
yeah,
it's certainly not picking her up.

1497
01:35:56.900 --> 01:36:01.250
There's nothing interesting about him.
He's like a dude that,
you know,

1498
01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:05.120
it's like,
I'm going to see him at the open mic.
You know?
I don't want that.

1499
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:07.490
I just want people that are better looking than me.

1500
01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:11.900
100% people who look like me doing stuff.
Yeah.

1501
01:36:11.901 --> 01:36:14.420
It's like I want the CW of porn.

1502
01:36:14.421 --> 01:36:18.810
I want beautiful people or stupid and that's,
yeah,

1503
01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:20.120
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1504
01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:23.690
Although I liked nineties born just because there was no future in it and I was

1505
01:36:23.691 --> 01:36:27.050
like,
these people just want to fuck.
That's true.
It did feel,
you're right,

1506
01:36:27.051 --> 01:36:31.580
there was more gravity to being a porn star in the 80s and that was a decision.

1507
01:36:31.610 --> 01:36:36.080
You are either addicted to coke or you just couldn't stop boning.
Dude,

1508
01:36:36.081 --> 01:36:39.860
why don't you get into making something that's dark,
so dark?

1509
01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:44.120
I can't,
again,
it's the same thing as like owning a strip.
Okay.

1510
01:36:44.121 --> 01:36:48.530
I will tell you this.
In like two,
this is probably 15 years ago,

1511
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:53.510
I watched a special,
I watched real sex on HBO and there was a guy on it,
this,
uh,

1512
01:36:53.511 --> 01:36:56.450
he was a gay porn director and a drag queen,
I think.

1513
01:36:56.840 --> 01:37:01.790
And he ran a voyeur house for gay guys and all he did was set up cameras all

1514
01:37:01.791 --> 01:37:06.791
over this house and he was making 1,000,007 a month and subscriptions and I had

1515
01:37:07.131 --> 01:37:09.470
a little money time and I was like,
oh are we doing this?

1516
01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:12.610
Like what do I just rent a house in West Hollywood ragged?

1517
01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:16.250
I figured like getting it would probably cost you 50 grand and then just offer

1518
01:37:16.251 --> 01:37:20.480
free rent to hot dudes.
Oh yeah,
like hello,
I want you to do this now.

1519
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:23.150
I think probably that ship has sailed because no one pays report anymore.

1520
01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:24.193
But he said he's like,

1521
01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:27.260
he's like our subscribers cause you could type in what you wanted the guys to
do.

1522
01:37:27.410 --> 01:37:29.510
He's like,
they don't even want to watch them have sex.
They're like,

1523
01:37:29.570 --> 01:37:33.650
take off your socks,
take a shower.
Like simple things like real life stuff.

1524
01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:38.030
And I was like,
this feels almost victimless and I would love that money.
Yeah,

1525
01:37:38.031 --> 01:37:41.000
of course.
But directing like porn porn like,

1526
01:37:41.001 --> 01:37:45.570
hey could you do it again and like look more scared.
Like that seems like,
oh,

1527
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:47.510
then you're like,
I'm going to come in my pants.

1528
01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:51.370
What qualifies as porn now it's like fucking cheat.

1529
01:37:51.390 --> 01:37:55.430
It just seems like evidence and like a long running investigation.

1530
01:37:56.440 --> 01:38:01.440
I refuse to believe this.
Many people want incest porn.
Yeah,
that is a huge show.

1531
01:38:01.441 --> 01:38:04.200
Feels like it feels like,
I always,

1532
01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:07.620
I think there's like in my head there's like a meeting of like what kind of porn

1533
01:38:07.621 --> 01:38:09.570
should we make of the industry?
And they're all like,

1534
01:38:09.571 --> 01:38:12.240
how about people boating who are attractive?
And then was like,
good idea.

1535
01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:15.680
And then I feel like there's one guys like brothers and sisters are like La,

1536
01:38:16.290 --> 01:38:19.290
Hey Scott,
we're x.
But that's not,
it won't shut the fuck up,

1537
01:38:19.291 --> 01:38:22.270
but I wonder it's gotta be popular.
You gotta gotta be,
they release,

1538
01:38:22.271 --> 01:38:25.500
they release those things.
Usually if there's like a report,
you know,

1539
01:38:25.530 --> 01:38:26.910
I think yeah,
hub will be like,

1540
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:30.960
here's like the five most popular search terms and it's by region,

1541
01:38:30.990 --> 01:38:34.980
by country and you'll see what's big and yeah,
there's incest.

1542
01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:36.930
They love that incest shit man.

1543
01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:40.530
I've noticed they rename like clips that aren't,

1544
01:38:41.130 --> 01:38:44.220
they'll just name anything like stepsister.
It's like gnats plumber.

1545
01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:47.140
That's plumber scenario.
They're trying to get you to click on.
Yeah,

1546
01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:49.820
it's so weird.
So you know what you can,

1547
01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:52.620
you can obviously coincides with those divorce rates.

1548
01:38:52.621 --> 01:38:53.520
Just shooting through the roof.

1549
01:38:53.730 --> 01:38:56.400
No one would connect to it unless everyone had to step siblings.

1550
01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:01.470
It wouldn't be a thing even thought about rose.
I like a boss scenario.

1551
01:39:01.710 --> 01:39:06.450
A boss.
Yeah,
someone's in charge.
Someone's not power.
Power dynamic.

1552
01:39:06.451 --> 01:39:08.580
When I was younger and I watched more porn,

1553
01:39:08.610 --> 01:39:12.660
MILF was always made sense to me really well.
Just like someone,

1554
01:39:12.690 --> 01:39:16.570
it seemed again enthusiasm.
You liked that granny stuff too now.

1555
01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:20.640
Oh there was a figure model at my art school that was legitimately old.

1556
01:39:20.641 --> 01:39:25.641
Like she was like 85 and an 85 year old naked woman is more of a sculpture than

1557
01:39:26.071 --> 01:39:27.270
something you want to touch.

1558
01:39:29.260 --> 01:39:33.960
But how much do you get paid for that at art center?
I think you got paid.
Okay.

1559
01:39:33.961 --> 01:39:36.000
I think you've got like a few hundred bucks cause it's a long,

1560
01:39:36.001 --> 01:39:37.230
it's a seven hour class.

1561
01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:42.740
So to sit naked for a bunch of kids who are laughing inside for none of us were

1562
01:39:43.081 --> 01:39:44.340
laughing inside.
I would,

1563
01:39:44.341 --> 01:39:47.340
I would never be able to be an art student cause I would giggle.
They'll really,

1564
01:39:47.341 --> 01:39:50.370
everyone was serious.
You'd be surprised.
I actually thought about this.

1565
01:39:50.890 --> 01:39:54.060
I noticed even some of the models were beautiful people.

1566
01:39:54.090 --> 01:39:59.090
I never once got aroused cause you're my brain can't try to figure out how to

1567
01:40:00.211 --> 01:40:03.510
draw something and w and think about it sexually at the same time.

1568
01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:08.060
It just doesn't happen.
But by Cox you see some Nice Cox.
Oh yeah.

1569
01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:11.310
I've told this story before,
but it was a long time ago.

1570
01:40:11.311 --> 01:40:14.850
There was a guy who modeled at Pasadena City College.
He was a dancer.

1571
01:40:14.851 --> 01:40:19.530
His name was shadow and his Dick was no joke.

1572
01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:20.970
11 inches soft.

1573
01:40:21.570 --> 01:40:25.920
And like a Pringles can like one time an old,
like there's a lot of,

1574
01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:29.490
there's a lot of older women who take like a figure drawing classes at junior

1575
01:40:29.491 --> 01:40:30.240
colleges.

1576
01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:33.960
One time a woman came in late and saw shadows Dick and dropped her art Ben.

1577
01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:37.500
She was like,
it was,

1578
01:40:38.190 --> 01:40:39.750
I would tell my friends about it.
I was like,

1579
01:40:39.751 --> 01:40:41.010
there's this dude and they didn't believe me.

1580
01:40:41.011 --> 01:40:44.850
So one day I just drew it to scale and like brought it by.
I was like,
here it is.

1581
01:40:44.851 --> 01:40:45.840
They were like,

1582
01:40:45.841 --> 01:40:50.670
it was unusably large and that's what I'm thinking utility wise and I'm almost,

1583
01:40:51.090 --> 01:40:53.010
I don't believe shadow was straight.

1584
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:57.310
He was rail thin like he was,
he was really cool looking.

1585
01:40:57.311 --> 01:41:00.970
He had like really long dreadlocks and more like these cool scars and he had

1586
01:41:00.971 --> 01:41:04.660
this cool like Cain you would kind of stand on then Lena.

1587
01:41:04.690 --> 01:41:08.650
But this thing was shocking.
Oh weird.
So it was a black guy with this big,

1588
01:41:09.450 --> 01:41:11.980
yeah,
it was shocking and,

1589
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.070
and but again like really impressive but it wasn't,

1590
01:41:15.550 --> 01:41:17.770
it's just you're really just drawn shit.

1591
01:41:17.771 --> 01:41:20.830
Ever do that thing where he like smacks in the other hand are,
he's like,
no,

1592
01:41:20.831 --> 01:41:22.590
but he fell asleep once it moved

1593
01:41:24.410 --> 01:41:28.240
while he was doing a later post.
He was doing a laying pose.

1594
01:41:28.330 --> 01:41:32.700
It didn't like get hard.
But it moved for sure.
And you know,

1595
01:41:32.770 --> 01:41:35.830
I was like a lizard.
I wasn't close enough but I bet you could hear it.

1596
01:41:37.850 --> 01:41:39.480
Yeah.
Just like you heard,
just like

1597
01:41:42.890 --> 01:41:44.740
the people fall asleep a lot when they're getting drawn.

1598
01:41:44.890 --> 01:41:46.720
Only if they're doing it like a laying posts.

1599
01:41:46.721 --> 01:41:49.030
Like sometimes you do like an hour in a painting class,

1600
01:41:49.031 --> 01:41:51.670
you'd do like a long pose all day,
like a three hour pose.

1601
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.620
So data really be a pain.
The figure modeling is incredibly difficult.

1602
01:41:56.830 --> 01:42:00.940
Like people don't,
I think a lot of people try it to stay in the same position.

1603
01:42:00.941 --> 01:42:03.100
First of all,
no one can stay in the same position for more than 20 minutes.

1604
01:42:03.101 --> 01:42:04.960
I always move a little.
So you're always,

1605
01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:07.930
you got to hurry up and get the hard parts like the face and shit cause they're

1606
01:42:07.931 --> 01:42:11.310
going to turn.
But like a long pose,
they always picked uh,

1607
01:42:11.670 --> 01:42:15.580
a position that was basically sleeping cause you can't stand in one position for

1608
01:42:15.581 --> 01:42:18.030
three hours.
Your body gives,
I think people would fall asleep in the leg,

1609
01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:19.300
they'd fall asleep.
A lot of them.

1610
01:42:19.450 --> 01:42:22.570
I mean you usually do like 45 minutes or like 30 minutes and they get like a

1611
01:42:22.571 --> 01:42:24.400
five minute break,
but still even that,

1612
01:42:24.401 --> 01:42:26.080
but they would get in a position that was really comfortable.

1613
01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:29.980
I would be nothing but sleep.
They'd be like,
Oh yeah.
Hey Tom.

1614
01:42:30.110 --> 01:42:33.190
He says like,
you're snoring.
Everyone's fucking

1615
01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:40.120
the snoring.
Oh God.
Did you hear stories sometimes?
No.
No one ever.

1616
01:42:40.270 --> 01:42:42.760
Oh wait,
no though.
Yeah.
There was one old guy,

1617
01:42:42.970 --> 01:42:46.720
he looked like Santa Claus and he would not often snore.
It was pretty cute.
Yeah,

1618
01:42:46.750 --> 01:42:48.640
that's me.
But he was such,

1619
01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:52.840
he was such a beloved figure model because of that big beard.
He was so easy.

1620
01:42:52.841 --> 01:42:55.960
It made him so easy and fun to what was his package like?
It wasn't good.

1621
01:42:56.860 --> 01:42:59.620
It wasn't good.
There was only two guys,
I don't know.

1622
01:42:59.621 --> 01:43:03.100
There was three guys with decent packages.
There was shadow shadow,

1623
01:43:03.130 --> 01:43:05.210
but he didn't model it arts center,
which was kind of a bummer.

1624
01:43:05.820 --> 01:43:08.080
He had modeled at art center,
not figure modeled.

1625
01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:13.300
There was a professional x dancer who was Latin and he had a good piece and a

1626
01:43:13.301 --> 01:43:17.650
great buy and then there was a guy that kind looked like a bodybuilder and he

1627
01:43:17.651 --> 01:43:21.610
had a decent piece.
He was a good,
those guys were all really good figure models.

1628
01:43:22.030 --> 01:43:24.880
This now I go to one,
I go to like a figure drawing workshop.

1629
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.880
There's never any dudes,
because I think it's all,

1630
01:43:27.881 --> 01:43:29.840
it's all women who are like kind of dancer.

1631
01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:33.250
He looking and I think it's because they probably pay like a hundred bucks and

1632
01:43:33.251 --> 01:43:36.640
like you kind of don't want a guy in the room who could take 100 bucks for

1633
01:43:36.641 --> 01:43:40.690
getting,
she's probably literally insane.
Yeah.

1634
01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:44.860
So I would like to go in there and just get on my knees,

1635
01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:48.100
bend forward and spread the cheeks and be like,
draw that.

1636
01:43:48.100 --> 01:43:52.010
I mean you'd have to hold that for like seven hours.
It's amazing.

1637
01:43:52.011 --> 01:43:56.390
The lack of weird things that happened in a room with someone randomly naked.

1638
01:43:56.450 --> 01:43:58.310
Really.
There was only one when I was in school,

1639
01:43:58.311 --> 01:44:01.250
there was this guy who was autistic,

1640
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:04.460
but a brilliant artists like he could draw crazy.
Good.

1641
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:09.020
And he was a little strange and I guess he was staring at the model just like

1642
01:44:09.021 --> 01:44:13.940
for two in a way that was weird,
like in between poses and she was like,

1643
01:44:14.450 --> 01:44:18.890
please stop staring at me.
Yeah.
And so he was a weird dude.

1644
01:44:18.891 --> 01:44:22.100
So he put a bag over his head and cut like I holes in it.

1645
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:27.140
And then they had to kick him out of school.
Sound guys,
one of the students?

1646
01:44:27.170 --> 01:44:31.030
Yeah,
Jesus put to watch this guy draw was amazing because he would,

1647
01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:34.050
he would like,
so he'd be drawing maybe to figure model there and he,

1648
01:44:34.090 --> 01:44:34.821
he would go like this,

1649
01:44:34.821 --> 01:44:38.090
but he wouldn't be touching the paper and then you just go and it'd be like the

1650
01:44:38.091 --> 01:44:40.010
perfect line.
Like he'd be like,

1651
01:44:42.350 --> 01:44:44.410
it was like watching a sword fight and you'd watch this dude.
Right.

1652
01:44:44.411 --> 01:44:46.040
And you could nail it.
It was incredible.

1653
01:44:46.460 --> 01:44:48.220
But then he put a bag on his head and had to leave school,

1654
01:44:48.260 --> 01:44:51.880
but he was just creepy and just a little off.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1655
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:56.060
And he could really only figure draw.
He couldn't like do other stuff.

1656
01:44:58.050 --> 01:44:59.150
There was a lot of like,

1657
01:44:59.570 --> 01:45:03.290
art school is full of people that are a little left to center,
but whatever.

1658
01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:09.890
Thank God there's so much Dolores.
You do?
Alright.
I drink so much water.

1659
01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:14.900
You wouldn't know what that's like.
Oh yeah.

1660
01:45:14.901 --> 01:45:18.380
Here's another one that's not another one.
That's the same way.

1661
01:45:18.381 --> 01:45:22.970
I'm just see you had like two ounces.
You're like,
I gotta pee me.

1662
01:45:22.971 --> 01:45:27.080
I drink like 20.
I'm like,
well my body's just getting started.

1663
01:45:27.970 --> 01:45:28.660
I don't,

1664
01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:32.030
I think I tried not to drink water because I don't want to be going to the

1665
01:45:32.031 --> 01:45:35.470
bathroom all the time.
I know,
but you have to hydrate,
hydrate code.

1666
01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:40.310
Where can people see you?
The comedy store?
I'm there every weekend.

1667
01:45:41.090 --> 01:45:44.240
This weekend.
No,
I'm,
I'm with Whitney this weekend in DC.

1668
01:45:44.241 --> 01:45:47.660
She's taping her special.
You're going to open the special?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh,

1669
01:45:47.661 --> 01:45:50.450
that's awesome.
Congrats.
Yeah.
That's awesome.

1670
01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:55.760
Are you guys doing any like shows like the night before,
two nights before?
Uh,

1671
01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:59.360
there's like a,
there's like a run through the night before.
Before the taping,

1672
01:45:59.361 --> 01:46:03.570
but I think everything's sold out.
Some Whitney,
Cummings.
Sure.

1673
01:46:03.740 --> 01:46:07.970
She got fans.
And then after the mini store.
Real Nice.

1674
01:46:08.330 --> 01:46:13.220
I'll be inside you.
So some respect.
Oh yeah.
That story.

1675
01:46:13.221 --> 01:46:17.030
You can find me on social media,
Kevin Gee,
Christie,
hilarious comic.

1676
01:46:17.031 --> 01:46:20.990
Go see him at the store and go see him anywhere.
Um,
seriously.

1677
01:46:21.210 --> 01:46:24.830
See me in the market?
No anywhere.
You can see Kevin Christie,
you should,

1678
01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:28.300
he'll draw your dick in the checkout line.
Yeah.

1679
01:46:28.970 --> 01:46:33.620
If you bust out your cock,
I will say I K I am.
Look,

1680
01:46:33.621 --> 01:46:34.454
I brought a sketch.

1681
01:46:36.530 --> 01:46:39.200
I thought you could draw the whole staffs ticks here.
Oh,
okay.

1682
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:44.030
That's a great idea.
Dick Detective.
Yeah.
Oh,
in a lot.
If by the way,

1683
01:46:44.031 --> 01:46:46.460
if there was a lineup I could pick shadow out till this day,

1684
01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:48.990
and that was 20 years ago,
you know,

1685
01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:53.280
if we can put a call out there to shadow I,
dude,
I've mentioned him before.

1686
01:46:53.490 --> 01:46:57.840
I wish I could find him.
How old was he then?
He was probably in his twenties.
Oh,

1687
01:46:58.110 --> 01:47:01.410
so he's still out there.
It's probably swinging that thing around.
I mean,

1688
01:47:01.470 --> 01:47:02.700
there's no way.

1689
01:47:02.701 --> 01:47:06.540
He's not in demand in some region because of that.

1690
01:47:06.541 --> 01:47:08.640
Magnificent and his body was incredibly,

1691
01:47:08.641 --> 01:47:11.580
it's probably six one probably weighed 120 pounds,

1692
01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:13.950
God and six pounds of it was dick

1693
01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:17.160
and he was so nice.

1694
01:47:17.190 --> 01:47:20.690
What'd you guys talk about it and breaks and stuff like shadowed man.
Jeez.

1695
01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:24.570
You know my friend Travis went to junior college with me and we were like,
Dang.

1696
01:47:24.930 --> 01:47:27.930
It was like,
dude,
are you not talk about his day.

1697
01:47:28.150 --> 01:47:31.020
It'd be like if there was a fire in the middle of the room and not mentioning it

1698
01:47:31.021 --> 01:47:32.950
like someone just like lit off some mad.
He's like,

1699
01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:37.080
how do you not notice that shadow cock?
You're a hater if you don't mention it.

1700
01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:40.590
That's true.
If you don't mention it,
you're a hater.
Like,
Hey,

1701
01:47:40.591 --> 01:47:43.020
we just saw the most beautiful piece we've ever seen.

1702
01:47:43.710 --> 01:47:48.570
That guy is telling John Holmes to take a seat.
Okay,
okay.
You basically,

1703
01:47:48.571 --> 01:47:50.540
you realize you're telling like,
uh,
you're,
you're,

1704
01:47:50.541 --> 01:47:54.810
you're setting the scene for stories will be told for generations.
Right now.

1705
01:47:54.820 --> 01:47:58.500
People are out there like licking their lips.
Thinking about Shar Pei again,

1706
01:47:59.270 --> 01:48:04.080
just all right.
Just picture in Puerto Rican.
Kevin Christie,

1710
01:48:16.511 --> 01:48:20.770

We've been wanting to plan this for a while.

1711
01:48:21.010 --> 01:48:25.210
I am joined.
We are joined now by comedian,
writer,

1712
01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:30.010
actor.
He does it all.
George Perez.
Hey,

I'm excited.
I've been running into each other for a while.
Yeah.

1715
01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:40.400
He hooked me up with a gift last time I saw you.
Yeah.
How'd you like that?
Yes.

1716
01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:45.730
This life man.
It was uh,
it was pretty,
I mean why don't you tell her about it?

1717
01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:48.550
I gave him weed and it was called puppy breath.

1718
01:48:49.810 --> 01:48:52.600
Cause like when you smoke this weed,
everybody was,
oh my God.
Your breasts most,

1719
01:48:52.601 --> 01:48:54.910
okay,
so it's,

1720
01:48:54.911 --> 01:48:59.860
it's my boy bzz t biz and it was,

Yeah,

1721
01:48:59.890 --> 01:49:04.510

Yeah,
that FirstClass Canada.

1722
01:49:04.530 --> 01:49:08.740
That's it.
That's it.
I like it.
I like around when it comes to lead,

1723
01:49:08.741 --> 01:49:11.920
it's like whole foods for me.
I only buy the organic shit.
Yeah,
yeah.

1724
01:49:12.100 --> 01:49:16.930
Fuck all that.
Fuck that man.
Are you a,
you're doing shows all over now,
right?

1725
01:49:17.110 --> 01:49:22.000
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think the first time I ran into you,
I ran into recently,

1726
01:49:22.001 --> 01:49:24.160
but I still feel like the first time I ran into you,

1727
01:49:24.700 --> 01:49:27.280
it might've been with like a couple of these Chicago guys.

1728
01:49:27.310 --> 01:49:29.950
Are you friends with any of those guys?
I feel like I was,
I remember,

1729
01:49:30.230 --> 01:49:34.450
I remember the first time I ran into,
it was right after I did Rogan's podcast.

1730
01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:37.270
Wait a minute.
That's not the first time though.

1731
01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:42.400
For like remember me and you talking.
Really?
Yeah.
I remember seeing you at,

1732
01:49:42.401 --> 01:49:47.080
uh,
like you were with a group of guys and I was at a show,

1733
01:49:47.530 --> 01:49:48.160
like I'm talking

1734
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:52.630
<v 12>a long time ago where,
what city here?
Somewhere in La.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I mean,</v>

1735
01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:54.190
I know a couple of guys,
but Chicago,

1736
01:49:54.191 --> 01:49:58.840
but not like maybe they were with other Chicago guys maybe.
Maybe.

1737
01:49:58.841 --> 01:50:02.470
Yeah.
Yeah.
And so,
wait,
when was the Rogan One?
Not that long ago.

1738
01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:04.990
I did it like three years ago.
Okay,
okay.
Yeah.

1739
01:50:05.050 --> 01:50:09.430
And I remember watching you guys on it and they asked you and goes,

1740
01:50:09.431 --> 01:50:11.200
do you know George Perez?
And you were like,
yeah,
no,

1741
01:50:11.201 --> 01:50:15.720
that comic book artists and I laughed my ass off.
I said that.
Yeah.

1742
01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:20.180
Cause there's a guy named George Perez that draws for marvel and DC.
Oh.

1743
01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:25.270
And he's bald headed like me.
It's weird.
You have an amazing story.

1744
01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:29.860
Oh,
it's pretty fucking crazy.
I remember the first time I heard this story,

1745
01:50:29.861 --> 01:50:34.480
I was like,
this just sounds not true.
Like just

1746
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:39.010
the fact that like there's a comic and you're doing,

1747
01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:41.800
you're doing things and you get on TV.
Yeah.

1748
01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:46.990
And that this leads to prison.
I mean she doesn't know.

1749
01:50:47.460 --> 01:50:51.300
She doesn't know the story.
I purposely did not want to get the deals.
I was like,

1750
01:50:51.310 --> 01:50:56.230
here I got the first time.
You'd please.
Okay.
So I stopped gang banging.

1751
01:50:56.260 --> 01:50:59.530
I have a son,
but you know,
you're still gang banging.
But I'm not out there.

1752
01:50:59.531 --> 01:51:02.590
I'm not looking for trouble.
Where are you from?
First of all,
everybody knows,
oh,

1753
01:51:02.591 --> 01:51:07.060
from orange.
Okay.
And I don't want to say the,
I still got shit to say.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1754
01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:10.560
Gotcha.
And then we use around it.
Let me just to like kind of give it a,

1755
01:51:10.810 --> 01:51:14.440
some color.
You're surrounded by gang bang and as a kid,
right?

1756
01:51:14.441 --> 01:51:19.390
Well this is 1991 bro.
Okay.
Everyone's gangbanging.

1757
01:51:19.510 --> 01:51:21.010
Yeah.
Like,
I don't even know.
I'm on the,

1758
01:51:21.011 --> 01:51:24.050
I'm the captain of the football team and I'm gang maiming.
Really?
Yeah.

1759
01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:27.040
It's just like I,
back in those days,
nobody moves.

1760
01:51:27.041 --> 01:51:30.070
So it's everybody from kindergarten.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

1761
01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:31.960
It's all my friends.

1762
01:51:31.990 --> 01:51:36.280
And then we decided to make our own game because our family wouldn't let him be

1763
01:51:36.281 --> 01:51:38.140
from that,
from their game.
They're like,
you're not going to be for this.

1764
01:51:38.141 --> 01:51:41.290
Fucking gangs were like,
all right,
fuck it.
We made our own.
Really?
Yeah.

1765
01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:44.560
We started as a party crew and then we're like,
you know what?

1766
01:51:44.561 --> 01:51:47.920
We're going to parties and people are trying to beat us up so my friend decides

1767
01:51:47.921 --> 01:51:50.140
to bring gun and we're like,
all right.

1768
01:51:50.650 --> 01:51:54.580
<v 3>No,
you're a gang.
Yeah.
I didn't know you could start your own gang.
Pretty crazy,</v>

1769
01:51:54.581 --> 01:51:59.500

Yeah.
Yeah.
No,
you can pretty DIY of you guys.
It's pretty,

1770
01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:04.190
Do it yourself.
It's pretty punk rock.
Yeah.

1771
01:52:04.460 --> 01:52:07.210
I'll say that in the gang.
Like,
hey man,
we're DIY.

1772
01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:12.550
That was pretty bad right there.
Dyi Diy.

1773
01:52:12.910 --> 01:52:17.380
Do it yourself.
Do it yourself.
Yeah.
What you're talking now or the

1774
01:52:17.390 --> 01:52:21.350
<v 12>best thing about,
I guess all all gangs,</v>

1775
01:52:21.351 --> 01:52:26.330
but the thing that always grabs people's attention are like nicknames.
Yes.

1776
01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:30.880
Oh yes.
Smiley did chorus joker.
I'm shocked.
Shocked.

1777
01:52:32.060 --> 01:52:34.190
Yeah,
that's me.
Right.
That's a dope nickname.

1778
01:52:34.730 --> 01:52:37.010
Cause like when I got jumped in that,
first of all,

1779
01:52:37.011 --> 01:52:41.930
I hit drop seq of foot drop and then I got dropped.
It was just boom,

1780
01:52:41.931 --> 01:52:44.040
And they're like,

I like that.

1781
01:52:44.710 --> 01:52:46.950
That's tight nickname.
Hell yeah.
Yeah.

1782
01:52:47.190 --> 01:52:49.490
Back in the days to the girls who'd be like,
what's your nickname?

1783
01:52:49.491 --> 01:52:53.910
Or they call me shotgun baby to Cox and you blow your kid.

1784
01:52:54.860 --> 01:52:59.060
I can't leave.
I've never said that on fucking stage.
You saw that shirt?
No.

1785
01:52:59.061 --> 01:53:03.560
That's a good church.
That is a good shirt.
Yeah,
man.
I know.

1786
01:53:03.990 --> 01:53:04.823
I grew up here.

1787
01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:09.800
I grew up in San Fernando valley and my first friend was a chola named Shula and

1788
01:53:09.801 --> 01:53:14.030
she taught me how to smoke cigarettes when I was 13 and she will know how to

1789
01:53:14.031 --> 01:53:18.200
smoke cigarette smoke from Chula.
And she was like,
Hey,

1790
01:53:18.201 --> 01:53:21.140
you want to hang out with my friends and I?
She goes,
you like oldies?

1791
01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:23.170
And I was like,
fuck no,
I don't like fucking oldies.

1792
01:53:23.180 --> 01:53:26.050
Like I like Morrissey or whatever the fuck gay shit.

1793
01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:29.660
I was listening to you what I mean,
but did you listen to oldies,
Haley?
Yeah,

1794
01:53:29.661 --> 01:53:33.170
I grew up on that shit.
You know what Cholos grew up on?
Morrissey.

1795
01:53:33.230 --> 01:53:37.700
Cellos do grew up.
There's a story.
Yeah,
there was a story that,

1796
01:53:37.701 --> 01:53:42.500
I guess he was going to Woodstock somewhere and his bus broke down in Boyle

1797
01:53:42.501 --> 01:53:47.501
heights in east la and they're out there fixing the bus and all the Cholos came

1798
01:53:47.511 --> 01:53:51.260
and he was like amuse high.
Everyone's hair was slicked back,

1799
01:53:51.261 --> 01:53:52.550
the wrong crease down.

1800
01:53:52.850 --> 01:53:56.420
The women had roses and they made them food and they gave him heroin and he was

1801
01:53:56.421 --> 01:53:59.590
like,
I'll fucking staying here.
That's good.

1802
01:53:59.650 --> 01:54:02.590
I'm trying to find out if that's true.
Cause that's bomb.

1803
01:54:03.070 --> 01:54:08.000
You notice he caters to East la?
No.
Yeah,
he caters to East La.

1804
01:54:08.001 --> 01:54:12.740
He does shows downtown La.
East La.
Really Morrissey.
Yeah.

1805
01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:17.660
So oldies,
oldies were always just on,
right?
Angel Baby.
Yeah.

1806
01:54:18.030 --> 01:54:19.220
Oldies and funk.

1807
01:54:19.221 --> 01:54:23.600
But old these were on because like the culture for a Cholo is to love and

1808
01:54:23.601 --> 01:54:26.460
protect your lady.
Right.

1809
01:54:27.310 --> 01:54:31.730
Our lebows the man,
dude,
I got to work with him.
Fuck yeah.
It was crazy.

1810
01:54:31.770 --> 01:54:35.960
That's cool.
Yeah.
But you know,
by the way,
did you ever know that that the,

1811
01:54:36.010 --> 01:54:40.310
the term,
the word so low is in some Spanish speaking countries,

1812
01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:42.600
very derogatory.
You did know that.

1813
01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:46.850
So I've met like some Mexican people here and like,
you know,
in,

1814
01:54:47.190 --> 01:54:51.410
for people that don't know if you're like California and it kind of describes a

1815
01:54:51.411 --> 01:54:53.570
certain culture and a status,
right?
Yeah.

1816
01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:56.450
But like in Latin America,

1817
01:54:56.750 --> 01:55:01.230
Cholo is like in some places like Edward.
Yeah.
You know,
and it means it's too,

1818
01:55:02.210 --> 01:55:06.110
ah,
nevermind.
It's a,
but it's,
it's a,
it basically,

1819
01:55:06.290 --> 01:55:09.380
you would say it too.
It's kind of native.
Yeah.
Native.

1820
01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:13.190
It's kind of worse than the n word.
Yeah,
it's pretty bad.
Cause like it's weird.

1821
01:55:13.191 --> 01:55:15.560
I've always had this argument,
my mom last night,
I was dating,

1822
01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:23.210
my mom was like,
I didn't come to America for you to be a fucking Cholo.

1823
01:55:24.020 --> 01:55:28.820
I walked for you to be a Cholo on.
I was like,
dude,
why you put this on me?

1824
01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:33.350
It's like fuck my bad.
You know what I mean?
But it is looked upon bad,

1825
01:55:33.351 --> 01:55:37.910
but it's only looked upon bad because they seen it as we were bringing them

1826
01:55:37.911 --> 01:55:42.160
down,
not realizing Cholos were created to protect the community.
Right.

1827
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:45.360
Because white people in blacks would come around and our community and try to

1828
01:55:45.361 --> 01:55:47.870
punk us and take what we had because they didn't want us there.
Right.

1829
01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.230
So the Cholos mate,

1830
01:55:49.260 --> 01:55:53.820
they became the protectors and then smile.
Now cry later.

1831
01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:58.800
Fuck yeah.
So,
okay,
so how does this crazy right here?

1832
01:55:58.950 --> 01:56:02.160
I love this.
I love this.
Right now I feel like I'm on like CSI,

1833
01:56:02.161 --> 01:56:03.660
but like you guys are cool lawyers.

1834
01:56:08.420 --> 01:56:12.330
So
all right,
so you're,
you're in this,
uh,

1835
01:56:12.490 --> 01:56:16.770

1836
01:56:16.771 --> 01:56:21.030

That's,

1890
01:59:37.470 --> 01:59:40.060
yeah.
Is that cool?
For sure.

1891
01:59:40.810 --> 01:59:44.930
I feel like a Weirdo saying that to you guys.
No,
no,
no.
That's fine.

1892
01:59:44.970 --> 01:59:47.060
There's no filters here.
There's no boundaries.

1893
01:59:49.870 --> 01:59:54.540
You can fart into a microphone if you want.
Just let me know.
Yeah.

1894
01:59:55.840 --> 01:59:56.621
Oh Man.

1895
01:59:56.621 --> 02:00:00.040
This is an award winning the last time I farted into something that was event in

1896
02:00:00.041 --> 02:00:03.770
prison.
No.
Yeah,
we're jumping ahead.
Okay,

1897
02:00:04.100 --> 02:00:08.440
we're going to go now.
Boom.
I'm doing comedy for like a year and a half.

1898
02:00:09.550 --> 02:00:13.660
A Wilmer Valderrama spots me at the laugh factory Latino night cause I'm riffing

1899
02:00:13.661 --> 02:00:15.550
on fools in the crowd.
I don't have material yet.

1900
02:00:15.730 --> 02:00:18.430
I'm trying to find material so I'm riffing,
you know,

1901
02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:21.250
I don't even know set up timing.
None of that shit yet.
I'm new.

1902
02:00:21.251 --> 02:00:25.600
They just threw me in this shit cause I'm quick.
Right.
So I do MTV.

1903
02:00:25.601 --> 02:00:26.440
Your Mama,

1904
02:00:26.650 --> 02:00:31.470
I remember that show and I'm winning so I'm,

1905
02:00:31.570 --> 02:00:36.070
I'm in like the last round now I'm deejaying at a strip club now cause I'm doing

1906
02:00:36.071 --> 02:00:38.740
comedy at night.
So I DJ at a strip club in the daytime.

1907
02:00:39.340 --> 02:00:43.600
It's a fucking Friday,
six o'clock.
I'm off work a half an hour.

1908
02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:48.370
I don't know where the fucking gain unit comes in and kicks the doors down at a

1909
02:00:48.371 --> 02:00:51.900
fucking strip club and I'm deejaying and I don't even dress like a gangster no

1910
02:00:51.901 --> 02:00:55.660
more.
I'm wearing like a Dave Chapelle.
I'm trying to dress like Dave Chappelle.

1911
02:00:55.661 --> 02:00:59.820
Remember I used to wear those ones on Chappelle.
So like the joggers shit.
Yeah.

1912
02:01:00.070 --> 02:01:02.830
And Ed then like they're like where's George Perez?

1913
02:01:02.831 --> 02:01:05.830
And I'm just sitting there going,
what the fuck is going on?

1914
02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:08.320
Where you're that startled by it.
Yeah.
Like what?
Yeah.

1915
02:01:08.321 --> 02:01:13.260
And then my manager was like,
he's rode here,
this guy.

1916
02:01:13.570 --> 02:01:17.050
That's what you want.
So I get locked up

1917
02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:23.590
a house quickly.
When you get locked up,
do you know why you're locked up?
Right.

1918
02:01:23.591 --> 02:01:26.590
Cause that first year,
well they tell you why right away.
Yeah.
You know what,

1919
02:01:26.650 --> 02:01:31.210
like see,
I'm not sure what the story is.
How old are you?

1920
02:01:31.211 --> 02:01:35.160
Just so I have context.
We need to have two children at this point.
Yes.

1921
02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:39.950
Two Baby Mamas.
You're working your day job and you've,
you're in Showbiz,

1922
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:42.620
you're on a TV show.
So your,
your success.

1923
02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:45.050
But we don't even know if it's gonna make it.
Yeah.
This is the,
we're like,

1924
02:01:45.051 --> 02:01:50.030
we're shooting a pilot.
It's kind of not the pilot,
but it is,
it's like,

1925
02:01:50.150 --> 02:01:53.360
it's weird.
Okay.
So you're on your way.
You're living your life.
You're,

1926
02:01:53.420 --> 02:01:56.570
you're going.
Yeah,
exactly.
Wow.
Thanks for reminding me.

1927
02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:01.160
No,
cause it's Kinda like fuck.
I do remember like,
yeah,

1928
02:02:01.161 --> 02:02:03.350
I remember like I wasn't gang banging or nothing.

1929
02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:06.220
How long had it been since you'd,
you'd been gang bang?

1930
02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:09.910
It's been like a year and a half.
I mean I'm,
I'm,

1931
02:02:10.010 --> 02:02:13.040
I'm still in the streets but I'm not at the parties and stuff like that,

1932
02:02:13.070 --> 02:02:17.630
you know?
And uh,
yeah,
it was weird though.
Cause before you,

1933
02:02:17.631 --> 02:02:20.540
when you go to the county,
you go to the county first,
know what happened.

1934
02:02:20.541 --> 02:02:24.850
They take me in,
they interrogate me.
Ah,
yeah.
They're like,
you're like,
Hey,

1935
02:02:25.790 --> 02:02:27.500
you see this guy?
You beat him up.

1936
02:02:27.501 --> 02:02:31.610
I beat this guy up at the park playing basketball.
I kicked this fucking ass,

1937
02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:36.460
like kicked his ass.
Like I won't see that scar right there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's,

1938
02:02:36.550 --> 02:02:39.860
it's,
I kicked his fucking ass.
This is from playing.

1939
02:02:39.900 --> 02:02:43.520
We were playing ball and I'm real good at basketball real good.

1940
02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:47.330
And I was clowning this full,
you know,
I could talk shit.

1941
02:02:47.570 --> 02:02:51.080
So you're getting scored on and this full swings on me and like misses.

1942
02:02:51.080 --> 02:02:56.060
And I remember just like body slamming,
punching all kinds of shit.
Fucked him up.

1943
02:02:56.090 --> 02:02:58.790
Fucked him up like so bad that people were like,

1944
02:02:58.791 --> 02:03:00.680
just getting your car and get the hell out of here.

1945
02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:04.670
So that's what I'm here for.
And I'm just going,

1946
02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:08.100
you know how you sit in your head thinking you know everything,
man,

1947
02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:12.680
these motherfuckers don't got shit on me.
This shit happen four years ago,

1948
02:03:12.681 --> 02:03:15.050
maybe three,
four years ago.
Yeah.

1949
02:03:15.530 --> 02:03:19.400
He didn't know who I was and no one at the park was going to say shit cause I

1950
02:03:19.401 --> 02:03:22.220
was a bad mother fucker back then.
They were like,
hey homie,

1951
02:03:22.221 --> 02:03:26.060
we don't know who did it.
You know,
money talks and bullshit fucking walks.

1952
02:03:26.150 --> 02:03:27.650
Somebody fucking came through.

1953
02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:30.890
This was the rumor that I heard that some punk ass voice,

1954
02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:33.440
a kicker with that I used,
I boned is lady.

1955
02:03:33.441 --> 02:03:35.630
You know how fucking guys all he bought my lady,
fuck him.

1956
02:03:35.630 --> 02:03:39.020
You should get locked up.
Gives my name up.

1957
02:03:39.710 --> 02:03:44.660
The Guy sees me on TV
on Yo Mama,

1958
02:03:44.930 --> 02:03:46.310
the guy that I beat up.

1959
02:03:47.770 --> 02:03:50.110
So he's on your Momma and the guy's like,

1960
02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:54.860
that's the guy that kicks your worst nightmare.
But here's the,

1961
02:03:54.950 --> 02:03:58.040
here's the thing,
man,
it's four years ago that you'd beat this guy up.

1962
02:03:58.100 --> 02:04:01.700
How could he be sure he can positively id?
Do you know what I mean?

1963
02:04:01.701 --> 02:04:05.690
You change in four years.
There's DA,
ah,
Riverside,

1964
02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:09.470
his sister's Da.
Yeah.
Riverside and it's not,
it's not in mine,
but you know,

1965
02:04:09.471 --> 02:04:13.820
they got connections,
they talk,
you know what I mean?
So you know,

1966
02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:18.410
I mean,
imagine you,
you're the judge and you look it up and you're like,
oh shit,

1967
02:04:18.411 --> 02:04:23.090
this guy already has to gum possessions,
tagging fucking curfew as a kid.

1968
02:04:23.570 --> 02:04:26.500
It was almost in juvenile hall.
And so they're just like,
so you know,

1969
02:04:26.510 --> 02:04:30.500
I didn't lawyer up or nothing.
Yeah,
I was just like,

1970
02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:32.450
so what's up?
And they were like,
well,

1971
02:04:32.451 --> 02:04:35.540
you're going to go to the county and you've got to go to court.
And you know,

1972
02:04:35.541 --> 02:04:38.130
my brothers,
my family works,
got money,
but I've never

1973
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:42.180
<v 12>asked them for nothing.
So I called my brother up a dog.
I need to get belt out.</v>

1974
02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:46.170
I'm doing real good in my life right now.
I'm a,
I'm not even done filming an MTV,

1975
02:04:46.171 --> 02:04:50.940
Yo Mama,
we're not even done because we were still going to do season three.

1976
02:04:50.941 --> 02:04:54.270
This is season one.
So,
and he also must think at first when you call,

1977
02:04:54.271 --> 02:04:58.110
like you just did some shit.
But the irony is that you hadn't done some shit.

1978
02:04:58.860 --> 02:05:01.890
Yeah,
it was,
it was funny.
I remember when I remember this Chola told me,

1979
02:05:01.891 --> 02:05:06.130
hey homie,
you got time for doing time.
Yeah.

1980
02:05:06.700 --> 02:05:08.220
And I was like,
fuck.

1981
02:05:08.221 --> 02:05:12.690
So now I'm out of court and I'm fighting this shit.

1982
02:05:13.350 --> 02:05:14.880
Now I lawyered up,

1983
02:05:15.210 --> 02:05:20.210
I'm fighting it and I just filmed the showtime special with Joey d is at this

1984
02:05:23.071 --> 02:05:26.110
time as I'm fighting,
this is,

1985
02:05:26.270 --> 02:05:30.600
I mean the stress of that of course,
but I'm just not thinking it's,

1986
02:05:30.750 --> 02:05:33.240
I have so much other shit going on in my life.
So wait,

1987
02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:36.120
your brother did bail you out?
Yeah,
my brother bells me out.

1988
02:05:36.121 --> 02:05:37.980
And then you get a lawyer and,

1989
02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:42.870
and then isn't this basically a case of a guy being like,
that's the guy.

1990
02:05:43.060 --> 02:05:47.190
That's the evidence especially,
right?
Yeah.
And then are you,
is the what?

1991
02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:51.630
What does the lawyer tell you is what the Lord is like,
check this out.

1992
02:05:52.410 --> 02:05:55.980
This happened at the area you're gang hangs out.

1993
02:05:56.580 --> 02:06:00.630
You're known for playing basketball,
this part.
Fuck,
you know,

1994
02:06:00.631 --> 02:06:05.550
and it was by my house kind of where I grew up and it's all bad bro.

1995
02:06:05.580 --> 02:06:06.960
So it was like,
he's like plea deal.

1996
02:06:06.980 --> 02:06:11.190
Like that's as well that this is where I fucked up.
The guy was like,
look man,

1997
02:06:12.120 --> 02:06:14.280
I remember one time he was like,
hey,
we're going to,

1998
02:06:14.370 --> 02:06:16.170
we're going to give you eight years,

1999
02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:21.180
cause I broke his eye socket so it's a great bodily injury at three years.

2000
02:06:21.450 --> 02:06:25.170
Fuck,
excuse me.
And I'm just going there like,

2001
02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:26.820
can I just do weekends?

2002
02:06:30.370 --> 02:06:33.520
I'm so busy right now.
You know,

2003
02:06:33.540 --> 02:06:35.880
you talked to other gang members that don't know shit and they're like,

2004
02:06:35.881 --> 02:06:37.500
hey homie,
just take it to the box.

2005
02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:40.530
At the end of the day they're going to see the evidence as low and they're going

2006
02:06:40.531 --> 02:06:45.210
to offer you three years,
take it and do half time.
And I'm like,

2007
02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:51.150
let's see what happens.
You know.
So My,
my lawyer is postponing,
postponing,

2008
02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:54.090
postponing,
and finally gets to the point where the judge is like,
look,

2009
02:06:54.600 --> 02:06:56.700
three years,
I can't give you half,

2010
02:06:56.701 --> 02:07:01.290
but I'll give you 80% and the lawyer doesn't even know I'm a comedian now.

2011
02:07:01.291 --> 02:07:06.240
I do charities and shit.
So I fire this lawyer,

2012
02:07:06.270 --> 02:07:10.620
I get another lawyer,
I'm going to win.

2013
02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:15.810
Nope.
I lost July.
What was it?

2014
02:07:16.110 --> 02:07:20.340
It was July 16th,
2009 no,

2015
02:07:20.341 --> 02:07:22.830
2006 as I got out and all night.

2016
02:07:23.790 --> 02:07:26.790
And I remember I stand in front of the judge and he was just like,
Yo man,

2017
02:07:26.791 --> 02:07:29.230
we find you guilty bro.
Is that how he said

2018
02:07:31.950 --> 02:07:34.850
it was weird?
I remember his name.
Judge Wapner cause

2019
02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:40.110
<v 13>yeah,
that's the Korean People's Court.</v>

2020
02:07:40.570 --> 02:07:43.720
You know what's funny is I never watched fucking people's court.

2021
02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:46.690
I told someone else they said the same shit.

2022
02:07:46.780 --> 02:07:51.580
And I remember like Fox.
So when they say you're guilty,

2023
02:07:51.581 --> 02:07:53.910
you don't get a sentencing,
they don't send you that.

2024
02:07:53.920 --> 02:07:58.920
You that you go to a sentencing trial now you don't even know how much your life

2025
02:07:59.471 --> 02:08:04.110
is ruined.
I want to let her fucking thing.
I want to understand this.
So for the,

2026
02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:08.410
for the judge Walker,
his thing was this a jury trial jury,

2027
02:08:09.150 --> 02:08:13.750
you did a full trifold trial.
Fuck.
And it was your defense?
I didn't do,
I wasn't,

2028
02:08:13.810 --> 02:08:16.340
I didn't go up there.
But to your defendant,

2029
02:08:16.350 --> 02:08:20.050
did your lawyer say like that wasn't him?
Is that what the defense was?
No,

2030
02:08:20.110 --> 02:08:23.830
the defense was his.
Look,
George plays basketball a lot there.

2031
02:08:23.980 --> 02:08:27.460
George did not do this to this guy.
He might have,
cause I told her,
look,

2032
02:08:27.461 --> 02:08:31.110
we gotta be honest dog.
At the end of the day,
the Lord is going to the judges.

2033
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:34.900
How I look at it,
judges look at you and they're like,
if you're a fucking liar,

2034
02:08:34.901 --> 02:08:38.170
we're gonna lock you up.
Right.
And that wasn't mine.
That's what I fall.

2035
02:08:38.171 --> 02:08:42.790
I'm not going to sit up there.
I can't lie like that.
Yeah,

2036
02:08:42.791 --> 02:08:45.610
I didn't do that.
Like I would have laughed.
You know what I mean?
Sure.

2037
02:08:45.630 --> 02:08:47.980
But my sense of humor,
sure.
I would've been like,

2038
02:08:48.220 --> 02:08:52.740
the defense was George plays there a lot.
He goes there.
He didn't have,

2039
02:08:52.870 --> 02:08:56.590
he didn't do it.
Look at him.
He's at now,
he knows I'm a comedian,

2040
02:08:56.950 --> 02:08:59.440
knows I'm a good dad,
you know what I mean?
Like dude,

2041
02:08:59.441 --> 02:09:01.540
he's not even own child support.
Like what the fuck's going on?

2042
02:09:01.990 --> 02:09:04.340
And then all these letters,

2043
02:09:04.341 --> 02:09:07.880
I had everyone write letters cause I'm fight when you fight it,

2044
02:09:07.910 --> 02:09:11.300
I had a lawyer so I can fight it out now that the judge,

2045
02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:14.900
the judge said you're guilty.
They put me in jail.

2046
02:09:15.770 --> 02:09:18.860
So now I'm in jail and I can't fight this and I'm waiting for sentencing.

2047
02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:22.940
So I'm thinking in my head,
fuck them and it gets seven years.
You know,

2048
02:09:22.941 --> 02:09:24.560
you're not even thinking,
oh I'm going to do comedy.

2049
02:09:24.561 --> 02:09:28.760
I'm more like fuck my family and my kids and him.
Boom.

2050
02:09:29.520 --> 02:09:34.490
Ah,
the judge Wapner came out from people's Court fucker.

2051
02:09:34.580 --> 02:09:36.080
He was like,
Mr. Perez,

2052
02:09:38.030 --> 02:09:41.750
I'm going to give you three years with half time.
He's like,
you know,

2053
02:09:41.751 --> 02:09:45.710
you look like a lot of good people came and spoke for you.
And you know,

2054
02:09:45.711 --> 02:09:48.860
it's weird cause I wanted to cry bro.
But there's so many other inmates,

2055
02:09:48.861 --> 02:09:53.240
they're like,
if I cry I'm at the answer to this shit.
I'm just like fuck yeah,

2056
02:09:53.241 --> 02:09:55.020
you know happiest hell you know,

2057
02:09:55.420 --> 02:09:58.730
do it at this time I got my girlfriend pregnant like she's pregnant with my

2058
02:09:58.731 --> 02:10:02.510
daughter.
I wasn't there for my daughter.
She was born bro.

2059
02:10:02.511 --> 02:10:07.370
Like I'm going through shit on my head.
Right.
Sure.
And then boom.

2060
02:10:07.790 --> 02:10:11.690
So that means three years with half time meaning a year and a half year and a

2061
02:10:11.690 --> 02:10:14.260
half way to think.
And I have a year and a half.
Yeah.

2062
02:10:14.420 --> 02:10:18.280
And then what happens though,
now you now you,

2063
02:10:18.300 --> 02:10:21.740
you wait in the county and then there's this thing called the chain.

2064
02:10:21.950 --> 02:10:23.960
The chain is when they chain you up,

2065
02:10:24.140 --> 02:10:27.990
it puts you on a bus and they drive you to Wasco and they've got a prison up

2066
02:10:27.991 --> 02:10:32.930
there in Bakersfield is called Wasco anxiety for you.
Just all the fucked up.

2067
02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:34.040
Horrible.
I

2068
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:35.780
<v 12>caught the chain Christmas Eve.</v>

2069
02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:39.470
No they can even fucking let you have Christmas.

2070
02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:41.600
Yeah cause I'm locked up by my house.

2071
02:10:41.601 --> 02:10:44.750
So my family had to come see me on Christmas and I was like,
but fuck it.

2072
02:10:44.751 --> 02:10:49.310
You want to get there?
Cause when you get to prison you're it,
it's different.

2073
02:10:49.311 --> 02:10:50.540
The county.
You're in a,

2074
02:10:50.930 --> 02:10:55.460
I'm in a jail cell 23 hours a day because I'm a high risk inmate gang.

2075
02:10:55.461 --> 02:10:59.390
All that bullshit.
So now when you're in prison,
you get to walk around,

2076
02:10:59.391 --> 02:11:03.740
but we're gonna we're going to get to that fascinate.
Fuck.

2077
02:11:03.741 --> 02:11:07.070
I need a drink.
Yeah.
Do you want some beer?
You want a beer?

2078
02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:10.370
You ever hear of these?
Uh,
yeah.
You know what?
Let me get a beer.
No,
you were here.

2079
02:11:10.371 --> 02:11:10.730
These,
uh,

2080
02:11:10.730 --> 02:11:14.540
remember those Cholos that were gang banging and in Syria and they're like,

2081
02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:17.410
they're like,
they went there just to fight.
Are you serious?
Yeah.

2082
02:11:17.820 --> 02:11:18.653
<v 14>Oh me.</v>

2083
02:11:18.710 --> 02:11:19.543
<v 15>That's fine.</v>

2084
02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:24.480
<v 12>Now this is the,
the censored one.
That's no fun.</v>

2085
02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:27.540
[inaudible] this is a Charles in Syria.
Yeah,

2086
02:11:27.550 --> 02:11:31.440
they're letting me shoot guns and shit,
Bro.
Let's see if they do that anyway.

2087
02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:35.080
<v 14>They always do.
I hit on me.
It's fucking morning.</v>

2088
02:11:36.810 --> 02:11:41.020
Who's that?
Dan Amigos,
right?
They're all me.
You represent myself.

2089
02:11:41.021 --> 02:11:43.670
Only is squeak Romy from that up.
Tracy.
Again,

2090
02:11:45.250 --> 02:11:49.520
fucking wine or from [inaudible] power gang homie still [inaudible]

2091
02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:53.610
<v 12>my boy.
And they're just like,
fools are real now.</v>

2092
02:11:53.611 --> 02:11:57.910
Now that I know what they are in prison.
The Persians in their main,

2093
02:11:57.911 --> 02:12:02.300
Ian's run with the med skins real.
Oh,
they're sued angels interested.

2094
02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:06.250
I know that that's who they align themselves with.
Yeah.
Because that's the,

2095
02:12:07.210 --> 02:12:11.740
they don't want to eat and listen to nobody else.
So when you hang out with us,

2096
02:12:11.741 --> 02:12:14.410
the Mexicans,
you eat with us and you're a lot of shower with us.

2097
02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:18.620
We got to get into all this stuff.
Oh yeah.
All the politics choice.
All right,

2098
02:12:19.630 --> 02:12:24.110
so yeah,
man,
you gotta remember this?
I've never been to prison.
Yeah.

2099
02:12:24.111 --> 02:12:26.970
So I'm saying is it okay?
I know like obviously you,

2100
02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:29.590
you run in with crew and getting into wild shit,

2101
02:12:29.890 --> 02:12:34.540
but there is a moment when you're going at prison of like terror,
right?

2102
02:12:34.630 --> 02:12:36.320
Oh yeah.
Oh fuck.
Is that happened?

2103
02:12:36.340 --> 02:12:41.080
That moment happens once I exited that bus because they strip you down of

2104
02:12:41.081 --> 02:12:43.330
everything and when you leave the county,

2105
02:12:43.331 --> 02:12:46.770
you don't want to take shit with you that you,
so you leave all your food.
Amen.

2106
02:12:46.771 --> 02:12:49.440
Is for you guys.
You know,
good luck fighting your case.
Here's that.

2107
02:12:49.441 --> 02:12:52.900
The pencils or papers,
stamps,
all that stuff that's needed.
Yeah.

2108
02:12:53.710 --> 02:12:58.710
You just show up to prison with all the letters from your family lyrics from

2109
02:12:59.351 --> 02:13:02.530
songs.
Cause you always,
that's how you make music in.

2110
02:13:02.531 --> 02:13:05.480
There's people send you the lyrics and you sing them.
Yeah.

2111
02:13:07.150 --> 02:13:10.420
And I have all my lyrics,
my letters,
my addresses,

2112
02:13:10.450 --> 02:13:14.020
the phone numbers that people I needed to talk to.
And the iPhone is not out yet.

2113
02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:18.070
Yeah.
So you gotta remember that it's,
it's all fuck.
And then you get off the bus,

2114
02:13:18.100 --> 02:13:20.140
you have no underwear,
no socks.

2115
02:13:20.410 --> 02:13:25.410
You just got a ghetto ass jumpsuit with fucking sandals on your fully shackled

2116
02:13:26.140 --> 02:13:29.860
like Jangle.
Yeah,
St Jangle.
Yeah,
sure.
Yeah,
you're like that.

2117
02:13:30.100 --> 02:13:34.110
But without the shit on like ankles and wrists.
So it's a real like shuffling.

2118
02:13:34.111 --> 02:13:34.650
Yeah.

2119
02:13:34.650 --> 02:13:39.650
And then get off the bus and you walk into an office like this,

2120
02:13:39.871 --> 02:13:44.100
there's a desk,
there's women men,
and they tell you,
hey,

2121
02:13:44.130 --> 02:13:46.050
get but fucking naked right now.

2122
02:13:46.980 --> 02:13:50.040
So your butt naked hanging out with,
no,

2123
02:13:50.100 --> 02:13:52.350
you're not supposed to be next to a black guy,
nick,

2124
02:13:52.351 --> 02:13:55.890
to a gay guy next to a transsexual.
Next.
You're not,
you don't,

2125
02:13:55.891 --> 02:13:58.230
you don't even know who you are around right now.
So in your head you're going,

2126
02:13:58.231 --> 02:14:02.010
fuck,
once these cuffs comes off,
I'm ready.
Boom.

2127
02:14:02.011 --> 02:14:05.540
Once the cuff comes off,
all right,
hey,
where are you from?
All right.

2128
02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:10.640
They put you in like cells and then there was this white boy that came in is,

2129
02:14:11.340 --> 02:14:14.640
I was all fucking bleeding this shit and I thought he got jumped,

2130
02:14:14.850 --> 02:14:18.770
but he won the fight of this other fool that came,
that was more fucked up.
Whoa.

2131
02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:22.290
And then you look at the signs and they say no warning shots.

2132
02:14:23.790 --> 02:14:28.320
So shoot to kill.
Yeah.
Then yeah.

2133
02:14:28.321 --> 02:14:32.610
Then you wait and you wait like in,
uh,
it'll,
it'll be like a building like this.

2134
02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:37.590
They're like sales,
but they hold 300 people and they're already separated.

2135
02:14:37.630 --> 02:14:42.410
You blacks,
whites.
Well,
they're asking you once you go in,
hey man,

2136
02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:44.370
who are you going to run with it as?
It's not even,

2137
02:14:44.371 --> 02:14:48.150
it's like it's already established.
You know,
like when you look,
if,

2138
02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:51.210
if I go to prison,
they look at all my tattoos.
They're like,
what's up homie?
Hey,

2139
02:14:51.211 --> 02:14:54.420
your people are over there though.
At your car right there.
Orange County a,

2140
02:14:54.421 --> 02:14:58.830
that's your car.
Your car is over there.
So,
whew.

2141
02:14:59.010 --> 02:14:59.843
Shit.

2142
02:15:00.590 --> 02:15:04.660
<v 2>Wait,
can we back it up when,
go ahead.
So backing up a second,
I know you,</v>

2143
02:15:04.661 --> 02:15:07.840
so you'd had a prior gun possession this,

2144
02:15:08.610 --> 02:15:10.970
but going a lot of times I be,

2145
02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:15.850
I've heard people say that have been locked up that jail,

2146
02:15:16.150 --> 02:15:21.150
like county jails in some places are like way worse then depending on the prison

2147
02:15:24.281 --> 02:15:29.180
that they would end up,
it was no fuck no was jail.
But when you got to

2148
02:15:29.270 --> 02:15:31.730
<v 12>jails,
just the guards because you're dealing with sheriffs,</v>

2149
02:15:31.731 --> 02:15:35.690
you're dealing with people that you're not going to see for a while.

2150
02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:40.640
And sheriffs are way different than the correction officers could correction

2151
02:15:40.641 --> 02:15:43.250
officers leave with you in the prison.
It's like you live together,

2152
02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:48.320
so you're plotting off like if you are a,
you look like a seal.
Sorry.

2153
02:15:48.450 --> 02:15:49.261
<v 2>Yeah,
it's all good.</v>

2154
02:15:49.261 --> 02:15:53.090
You have that look a like I fucking smash Cholos when I'm bored.
Yeah.

2155
02:15:53.360 --> 02:15:54.510
Do you know how many times,

2156
02:15:55.230 --> 02:16:00.090
like especially a few years ago before I was ever on anything that um,

2157
02:16:00.300 --> 02:16:04.180
I would be somewhere and somebody would be like,
how's it going,
officer?
What?

2158
02:16:04.620 --> 02:16:09.390
And they're like,
you know why he's sharp?
He's clean.

2159
02:16:10.150 --> 02:16:15.050
<v 12>Tell like that.
Cause we both try to,
I'll sharpen each other like,
oh,</v>

2160
02:16:15.051 --> 02:16:16.040
I'm going to get the other shit.

2161
02:16:17.260 --> 02:16:20.100
<v 2>No Way.
I keep on asking Tom,</v>

2162
02:16:20.101 --> 02:16:22.650
let's say he's going to go to prison and they asked him,

2163
02:16:22.651 --> 02:16:26.100
where do you belong now he's are not going to ask him shit.
They know what's up.

2164
02:16:26.130 --> 02:16:30.220
There's only one white place.
You Go,
well here's the thing.
He said he's got a

2165
02:16:30.310 --> 02:16:33.550
<v 0>Latin last name.
He speaks Spanish.
He's half protein.
Yeah.</v>

2166
02:16:33.610 --> 02:16:34.780
So where the fuck does he,

2167
02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:39.740
<v 13>they still send me the white people.
The whites are going to confront you first.</v>

2168
02:16:39.741 --> 02:16:42.560
That's right.
They're going to be like,
what's up?
Hey Tom Thompson.

2169
02:16:42.561 --> 02:16:44.630
Gura and they're going to be like,
Whoa,
who's,

2170
02:16:45.080 --> 02:16:46.730
who's the Mexican blood in your family?

2171
02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:50.980
<v 0>It's not,
I was adopted,
man.
My,
I'm actually Irish,
so,
oh fuck.</v>

2172
02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:54.070
They're going to be like adopted on you.
Gotta go over there and that's good.

2173
02:16:54.071 --> 02:16:56.680
Yeah.
Dot.
Did homey.
But he can't,
he can't

2174
02:16:57.240 --> 02:17:02.070
<v 13>Blanton's right.
Roll.
He could roll with Latins if he was just to be like,
look,</v>

2175
02:17:02.071 --> 02:17:06.150
homey.
I grew up with Latin.
I don't know.

2176
02:17:06.210 --> 02:17:09.600
I don't know the way the whites live.
Cause it's the way your culture.
Yeah.

2177
02:17:09.630 --> 02:17:14.180
How you live.
Check it out dog.
Like I'm not from a gang,
but I'm going to,

2178
02:17:14.181 --> 02:17:17.070
I'm going to roll with you guys if that's cool.
Then from there on though,

2179
02:17:17.130 --> 02:17:21.360
that's it.
That's it.
You cannot no longer leave groups.
Yeah,
that's,

2180
02:17:21.390 --> 02:17:24.030
that's it.
Yeah.
That is it.
Tom.

2181
02:17:24.770 --> 02:17:28.930
<v 0>You're in Bro.
And Yeah.
Can't wait.</v>

2182
02:17:29.380 --> 02:17:33.260
Can't wait.
Looking forward to it.
Yeah.
So you're in and they,

2183
02:17:33.261 --> 02:17:35.310
and they separate you.
Yeah.
But let's go back though.

2184
02:17:36.530 --> 02:17:40.480
The sheriffs are more chill,
let's say.
No,
they're fucking Dick.

2185
02:17:40.510 --> 02:17:41.720
But not as bad as a COO.
Yes,

2186
02:17:41.780 --> 02:17:46.320
<v 13>dude.
When I was,
I was in the county.
Yeah.
Tom,
I don't fuck around Bro.</v>

2187
02:17:46.780 --> 02:17:48.870
We,
we started a riot.
Yeah.

2188
02:17:49.100 --> 02:17:54.100
And we fucking started a riot and it was fucking crazy.

2189
02:17:54.451 --> 02:17:56.630
It,
we did a gangster two,
three in the morning.

2190
02:17:56.631 --> 02:17:59.500
We fucking woke up and everybody knew everybody.
We got,

2191
02:17:59.540 --> 02:18:01.910
we all pass letters on your homing three in the morning and we're going to get

2192
02:18:01.911 --> 02:18:04.940
up or we're going to check these fools.
I let them know who runs this place.
Okay.

2193
02:18:05.270 --> 02:18:07.100
So we get up at three in the morning.

2194
02:18:07.130 --> 02:18:10.430
Motherfuckers had pissed and their cubs don't want it on people.

2195
02:18:10.431 --> 02:18:12.290
We were fucking jumping people.

2196
02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:16.820
I don't know where the fucking the sheriff's see there's the guards would never

2197
02:18:16.821 --> 02:18:20.140
do it.
The sheriff's come on,
they start shooting us in the face with,
um,

2198
02:18:20.730 --> 02:18:25.430
the Kelly bag guns
and to them,

2199
02:18:25.431 --> 02:18:27.320
if you get here with the,
well you were in the fight.

2200
02:18:27.890 --> 02:18:32.330
So I'm all fucking Welt up in shit.
And then now I went to the hole.

2201
02:18:32.360 --> 02:18:35.020
Whenever you get into a fight,
you go to solitary confinement.
Yeah.

2202
02:18:35.060 --> 02:18:37.400
So I'm in the hole for 21 days and I remember I,

2203
02:18:37.850 --> 02:18:41.480
I had to go to court and now you're in a red jumpsuit cause you're a dangerous

2204
02:18:41.481 --> 02:18:45.990
inmate.
So now I'm fucking shackled again going to court and uh,
and uh,
and are,

2205
02:18:46.590 --> 02:18:50.420
you know,
they're mostly all,
I'm not racist towards white people.

2206
02:18:50.421 --> 02:18:53.780
I'm racist towards white cops because of what I've been through.
Sure.
You know,

2207
02:18:53.930 --> 02:18:58.100
and uh,
I just remember this young ass for all Roy and I was like,
ah,

2208
02:18:58.101 --> 02:19:01.190
you're one of those motherfuckers.
I was in that riot horn.
I was just like,
man,

2209
02:19:01.940 --> 02:19:04.550
I'm not allowed to talk to the police.
I didn't answer him.

2210
02:19:05.410 --> 02:19:10.250
So I'm fucking cuffed and Shit is mother fucker kicks me and I fucked her fall

2211
02:19:10.251 --> 02:19:10.820
forward.

2212
02:19:10.820 --> 02:19:14.540
And like I have to get up and defend myself and I remember getting up and I

2213
02:19:14.541 --> 02:19:18.060
defend myself and then the other homes are like,
Hey doc,
Nah,
Nah,

2214
02:19:18.380 --> 02:19:21.410
they're going to give you more time dog.
Just chill,
relaxed.
Are we seen it?

2215
02:19:21.411 --> 02:19:26.330
You're,
you did yours.
Just chill dog.
And I,
I can't wait to find that fucker.

2216
02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:28.160
I hate that I'm successful now

2217
02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:31.730
<v 12>though.
I hate that I'm successful because I want to kick his ass,</v>

2218
02:19:31.731 --> 02:19:34.880
but I know the consequences.
I just want to see him and be like,
hey man,

2219
02:19:34.881 --> 02:19:37.830
you want to have a talk?
I just want to roast them.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2220
02:19:38.270 --> 02:19:41.870
That would be more satisfying.
Yeah.
I feel that way about the jurors.

2221
02:19:41.930 --> 02:19:44.630
That put me away.
Like when you looked in their faces

2222
02:19:48.050 --> 02:19:51.410
in my head I was like fuck hey.
Like I don't,

2223
02:19:52.460 --> 02:19:55.790
I'm not mad at none of them.
I'm not mad at the judge.
They have a job to do.

2224
02:19:56.420 --> 02:19:59.630
This is what I learned from prison.
A man,
I fucked somebody up.
I did time.

2225
02:19:59.660 --> 02:20:04.520
It's funny over with,
right?
Like I feel free.
And was that guy that you beat up?

2226
02:20:04.521 --> 02:20:07.070
Was He in court every day?
Was he like when hey.
Oh yeah,

2227
02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:10.590
with the breathing machine.
With a breathing machine.
Yeah.

2228
02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:14.510
That's what the fight ended up.
He didn't,
he didn't need one.
He was just,

2229
02:20:15.080 --> 02:20:18.650
he was being like,
oh he was trying to get paid.
Cause he seen me,

2230
02:20:18.651 --> 02:20:23.330
he was all this shit.
Fuck.

2231
02:20:23.420 --> 02:20:27.750
Oh Man,
I want to find that fucker now too.
Damn Tom,
Christina got me.

2232
02:20:30.620 --> 02:20:31.450
They're going to play this up.

2233
02:20:31.450 --> 02:20:36.450
[inaudible] you guys get their ratings.

2234
02:20:40.690 --> 02:20:41.960
Wait.
So,
okay,

2235
02:20:42.110 --> 02:20:45.560
so sheriff's obviously it can be dicks but CEO's are a different level.

2236
02:20:45.580 --> 02:20:48.470
Well we're not allowed to talk to them,
but they're more respectful.

2237
02:20:48.471 --> 02:20:51.560
Who is the correction or we're not allowed to talk to no police,

2238
02:20:51.830 --> 02:20:54.680
but the correctional officers are more like,
hey,
good morning.

2239
02:20:54.800 --> 02:20:58.510
Hey how you guys doing a,
you guys need to extra towel cause they know.

2240
02:20:58.540 --> 02:20:59.450
Respond to that though.

2241
02:21:00.470 --> 02:21:03.620
Whenever you talk to a corrections officer or a sheriff,

2242
02:21:03.650 --> 02:21:07.520
you have to have another person from your crew with you.
Every race does that.

2243
02:21:08.090 --> 02:21:11.390
Why do they do that?
Because you're not snitching cause I got you.
I got you.

2244
02:21:11.450 --> 02:21:14.090
Say you were a cop.
I could just walk up to me like,
Yo man,

2245
02:21:14.091 --> 02:21:16.280
these fools are gonna stab me.
Yeah,
you don't look at them,

2246
02:21:16.281 --> 02:21:21.080
but I saw this going down.
I'll talk to you later,
right?
Hale.
No.

2247
02:21:21.470 --> 02:21:24.400
So you always have someone else because you're protecting everything.

2248
02:21:24.410 --> 02:21:27.290
You ask for permission.
A,
you know what?

2249
02:21:28.490 --> 02:21:30.980
My bunk has ants and shit.
I kind of need a spray.

2250
02:21:30.981 --> 02:21:32.900
I need to go ask the cop for something.
All right,
go ahead.

2251
02:21:32.901 --> 02:21:36.200
Let me go left of boom.
And you go with someone.
Gotcha.
Oh Wow.

2252
02:21:36.860 --> 02:21:40.520
That's fascinating.
Yeah.
Oh,
it's crazy.
Wait till we get to prison.
Let's go.

2253
02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:46.040
So now they give you a big old laundry bag,
like a navy style one,

2254
02:21:46.100 --> 02:21:50.930
and it has your,
it has,
uh,
your blues.
Your blues is the pride.

2255
02:21:51.320 --> 02:21:55.460
You got blue new jeans,
a shirt like this one.
And uh,

2256
02:21:56.230 --> 02:21:58.640
your,
uh,
Bob Barker shoes,

2257
02:21:58.641 --> 02:22:02.120
they give you the slip ons that are fucking ghetto is fuck you remember the

2258
02:22:02.121 --> 02:22:06.300
shoes?
Yeah.
Marker.
He has prison clothes.

2259
02:22:08.370 --> 02:22:13.130
Really?
Yeah.
Called the Bob Barker said,
yeah,
they're bad.
They're vintage now.

2260
02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:17.630
Really?
Yeah.
Now prison has this old thing called Pia prisons.

2261
02:22:17.650 --> 02:22:22.070
Institutional Art.
And they make all the clothes for all the prisons.
Yeah.

2262
02:22:22.071 --> 02:22:26.010
It's money,
Bro.
So this is

2263
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:27.870
<v 13>weird now Tom,
because like</v>

2264
02:22:30.320 --> 02:22:31.790
I've noticed my paperwork,

2265
02:22:32.120 --> 02:22:35.960
they got me with the killers because of my record and Wasco.

2266
02:22:36.140 --> 02:22:39.470
Defour is considered now it's the whole,

2267
02:22:40.100 --> 02:22:43.910
but when I was there it was like,
oh fuck.
It gets crazy now.

2268
02:22:44.600 --> 02:22:48.710
So now we leave this building and it's dark.

2269
02:22:48.711 --> 02:22:52.100
This is day one still.
Yeah.
This is day one and so you know,

2270
02:22:52.101 --> 02:22:54.560
you're know you're going into your people's though,
at least that.
No,

2271
02:22:54.561 --> 02:22:56.000
I don't even know.
They don't know that.
Yeah.
No,

2272
02:22:56.001 --> 02:22:59.720
I don't even know where I'm going.
Like,
like if I was,

2273
02:23:00.200 --> 02:23:02.150
if I was an inmate that wasn't crazy,

2274
02:23:02.151 --> 02:23:05.780
they would've put me in the dormitory where I would have been around a hundred

2275
02:23:05.781 --> 02:23:09.920
people relaxing,
talking to you.
What's up now?
They put me in a two man cell.

2276
02:23:09.921 --> 02:23:10.754
I knew it was coming.

2277
02:23:13.600 --> 02:23:17.320
You Walk fucking towers,
people on gun watching you.

2278
02:23:17.430 --> 02:23:22.430
There's cages in the hallway that are like from that ceiling,

2279
02:23:22.710 --> 02:23:25.990
for that bookcase to that camera,
the cages,

2280
02:23:25.991 --> 02:23:29.590
and there's people in there because we'll fight those fuckers.

2281
02:23:29.620 --> 02:23:32.290
If we walked down that hallway.
Now your enemies,

2282
02:23:32.650 --> 02:23:34.480
all my enemies are fucking insight,

2283
02:23:35.200 --> 02:23:39.760
but they're in cages and we're walking to our,
you know,

2284
02:23:40.180 --> 02:23:42.560
it sucks,
but I used to call him my home and I've a,

2285
02:23:42.561 --> 02:23:45.640
I'm going to go home right now.
I'm walking to my home.
Yeah.
And

2286
02:23:47.290 --> 02:23:50.660
it's weird.
We show up to a tower and the guy's like,
hey.
He's like,

2287
02:23:50.661 --> 02:23:51.401
what do you got?
He goes,

2288
02:23:51.401 --> 02:23:56.050
I got two fools from southern California and I got a black guy.
All right,

2289
02:23:56.051 --> 02:23:58.630
cool.
I didn't know there were going to house us together.

2290
02:23:58.631 --> 02:24:02.740
So all the blacks are on the bottom and all the Mexicans are on top

2291
02:24:04.760 --> 02:24:05.593
<v 10>and</v>

2292
02:24:05.760 --> 02:24:07.590
<v 13>boom,
I walk in,
they're all talking shit,</v>

2293
02:24:07.591 --> 02:24:09.570
what the fuck were you full put to us and all that.
And I just,

2294
02:24:09.840 --> 02:24:13.980
I've always known you don't say Shit,
you just do it.
Yeah.
So I'm,
I'm,

2295
02:24:14.220 --> 02:24:17.640
I'm biting my tongue and I see a home upstairs.
Good job mommy.

2296
02:24:17.670 --> 02:24:20.100
Because you recognize dude.
No,
no,
no.
He,

2297
02:24:20.101 --> 02:24:22.560
he could tell I'm one of him cause he's just like,

2298
02:24:24.200 --> 02:24:26.280
like I already get the signs like,
you know,

2299
02:24:26.430 --> 02:24:28.140
we talked to each other in sign language.

2300
02:24:28.170 --> 02:24:31.320
I know how to do sign language as far as telling you just,
yeah,

2301
02:24:31.321 --> 02:24:34.920
he's just letting me know like,
I see you keep it all right.
Hey,
you're,

2302
02:24:34.921 --> 02:24:37.980
you're going to come up.
And he's just like,
then boom.

2303
02:24:37.981 --> 02:24:40.670
Then the gargoyles so boom,
I go up there.

2304
02:24:40.700 --> 02:24:43.410
Then once you go into your jail cell,

2305
02:24:44.310 --> 02:24:48.630
it's mandatory that you show your paperwork to show what you're locked up for.

2306
02:24:48.631 --> 02:24:53.340
Because if that should says pedophile rapist niche,
you're done.
That's it.

2307
02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:58.100
That's it.
So boom,
checks it out.
Oh,

Oh.

2308
02:24:58.550 --> 02:25:02.430
Oh you and like you got homies from your area here.
Like it's all right.
Cool.

2309
02:25:02.431 --> 02:25:04.290
What do you,

hey,
that's your bunk.

2310
02:25:04.620 --> 02:25:09.390
I get my cleaning spray cleaned my bunk.
Woopty Woo.

2311
02:25:09.391 --> 02:25:12.690

You know,
and it's kind of weird cause you know,

2312
02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:14.820
I lost my whole comedy

2313
02:25:16.410 --> 02:25:20.280
personality for sure.
That was not asked you that.
Yeah.
Now I'm just like,

2314
02:25:20.281 --> 02:25:24.680
well saw Paul me a shotgun off from Orange Don.
All right,
cool.
Boom eight.

2315
02:25:24.681 --> 02:25:28.600
That's my bunk.
I ain't saying I got kids.
I ain't saying I do comedy.

2316
02:25:28.601 --> 02:25:31.820
I ain't saying none of that shit.
I'm a fucking gangster homie.

2317
02:25:32.670 --> 02:25:36.280
You know what I mean?
And I didn't know this,

2318
02:25:36.281 --> 02:25:38.680
but the cell that I'm going in,

2319
02:25:38.681 --> 02:25:42.250
the guy that was just their fucking fought the guards

2320
02:25:43.230 --> 02:25:44.063
<v 16>and</v>

2321
02:25:45.220 --> 02:25:49.510
<v 13>in prison there's four yard,
there's two yards.
Okay.
There's one,
there's like,</v>

2322
02:25:49.511 --> 02:25:53.380
we call it the one side to Tucson in the three side and the four side.

2323
02:25:53.381 --> 02:25:54.640
That's where the piece of shits are.

2324
02:25:54.910 --> 02:25:58.270
That rape as pedophile snitch is a transsexual.

2325
02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:01.590
It actually put the gaze yet you have to because if you put,

2326
02:26:01.700 --> 02:26:05.070
they put the transsexuals and the gaze with the pedophiles and the rapist.
Yes.

2327
02:26:05.620 --> 02:26:08.450
It's protective.
It's a special needs yard.
I see.

2328
02:26:08.451 --> 02:26:10.450
So they won't get fuck cause if they get in with you guys,

2329
02:26:10.451 --> 02:26:14.570
that's a wrap and you ever see that happen?
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.

2330
02:26:15.540 --> 02:26:20.540
See what happens is is you leave main line and you go to protective custody yard

2331
02:26:22.160 --> 02:26:22.993
<v 16>and</v>

2332
02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:27.080
<v 13>you're like,
fuck this.
I don't want to be here no more.
Maybe they'll forget.</v>

2333
02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:31.350
It's been 10 years.
I want to go back over there where there's life.
Right.

2334
02:26:31.460 --> 02:26:34.360
You know what I mean?
Is protective custody is horrible.
Yeah.
You're just there.

2335
02:26:34.430 --> 02:26:37.340
You don't know if you're selling is a rapist,
child molester and none of that.

2336
02:26:37.460 --> 02:26:42.440
You don't know who you're living with.
And he's a snitch.
He's a piece of shit.

2337
02:26:42.770 --> 02:26:46.760
That's all we'd look at it and yeah but fuck all that.

2338
02:26:46.761 --> 02:26:47.780
I didn't want to think about that.

2339
02:26:48.980 --> 02:26:53.210
So I fucking go to sleep for like an hour and they rate us that my first time in

2340
02:26:53.211 --> 02:26:57.860
prison.
Yeah.
And Yeah.
All right,
go ahead.

2341
02:26:57.861 --> 02:26:59.640
What's next?
They find,

2342
02:26:59.860 --> 02:27:04.760
they find that they rated all the Mexicans cause we were at a war with the

2343
02:27:04.761 --> 02:27:09.110
blacks and that only existed on this yard when you go to another yard,

2344
02:27:09.230 --> 02:27:12.800
the blacks and the mets,
cause we weren't fighting.
It's weird like other,

2345
02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:15.710
it's like communities,
this community.
He's like Nah,
fuck that shit.

2346
02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:18.350
They're like Ha.
So it's weird cause we're,

2347
02:27:18.440 --> 02:27:23.440
we're at war with blacks and a black came from another side of the prison and

2348
02:27:24.681 --> 02:27:26.600
we,
we weren't at war with him.

2349
02:27:27.190 --> 02:27:30.380
Oh it was fine.
Yeah.

2350
02:27:30.381 --> 02:27:32.630
I remember telling for a doc because in prison,

2351
02:27:32.631 --> 02:27:36.410
like the guards play this game where they do unlock,

2352
02:27:36.440 --> 02:27:40.130
sold the open a door for people that got to go somewhere and they'll open

2353
02:27:40.131 --> 02:27:45.110
another door and if they open enemy doors,
you got to fucking fight.

2354
02:27:45.260 --> 02:27:48.830
And they're doing that on purpose.
Yeah,
they're bored.
Bored.
That's fucked up.

2355
02:27:49.250 --> 02:27:53.620
Now you mentioned looking fresh.
You're like looking tight,
right?
What,

2356
02:27:53.621 --> 02:27:55.640
what's that all about your,
you started to say that and I was like,

2357
02:27:55.641 --> 02:27:58.890
let's wait until later.
You went to like out,
uh,
there's,

2358
02:27:59.240 --> 02:28:02.750
there's a term that we made up called Bonner rule a home and you want to look

2359
02:28:02.751 --> 02:28:06.110
bond a room fucking crease down.

2360
02:28:06.300 --> 02:28:11.300
Like you want to show every other race were cleaner than you would dress nicer

2361
02:28:11.331 --> 02:28:15.200
than you were.
Tighter than you cab and Cholos always have like that clean hands.

2362
02:28:15.470 --> 02:28:18.710
Well that's what we are.
We're like,
hey homie,
like I'm not a piece of shit.

2363
02:28:18.711 --> 02:28:22.610
Look at you all dirty.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And that's just how it is.
It's weird.

2364
02:28:22.611 --> 02:28:25.340
I still iron to this day.
I don't even go to the cleaners.
Yeah.

2365
02:28:25.341 --> 02:28:29.060
You iron your shirt hair,
my suit.
Anything.
Yeah.
Oh,
it's weird.

2366
02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:33.210
And yeah man,
it's pride a day or let's say,
um,

2367
02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:37.160
so you get your raid,
it's like day two.
Is it slowly?

2368
02:28:37.910 --> 02:28:40.610
Are you as somebody like vouching like this who you are?

2369
02:28:40.611 --> 02:28:44.080
You want me to make friends?
Well,
it's,

2370
02:28:44.150 --> 02:28:48.980
it's the biggest camaderie ever.
Like,
like once I got there,

2371
02:28:49.070 --> 02:28:54.020
there was a letter that was sent a weeder.
Hey,

Boom.

2372
02:28:54.021 --> 02:28:57.920
And people are like,
excuse me?
People are like,

2373
02:28:57.921 --> 02:29:01.580
I know people from his gang.
Oh,
this feels from a solid neighborhood.

2374
02:29:01.960 --> 02:29:03.670
Know what I mean?
Cause we're,

2375
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:07.790
we've been in the game for a long time where I'm at and I kind of know people

2376
02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:12.440
and uh,
this is the weird fucking part.

2377
02:29:13.190 --> 02:29:17.510
They five,
I did showtime.

2378
02:29:19.160 --> 02:29:24.020
I don't fucking know if it came out right.
We have TV in the day room.

2379
02:29:24.170 --> 02:29:28.850
No,
they don't fucking have show time.
Do they have a commercial?

2380
02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:33.740
Oh fuck I asshole comedy slam because bakes and I'm just going on my head.

2381
02:29:33.741 --> 02:29:38.690
What the fuck?
Yeah,

2382
02:29:38.691 --> 02:29:43.550
Yeah.
Oh,
but now no one knows me in George Perez.
I'm shotgun.
Shotgun.

2383
02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:47.630
Yeah.
Yeah.
I haven't heard my name,
George since I was in the county.

2384
02:29:48.500 --> 02:29:51.340
So this commercial airs is,
everybody started going like,
no,
no,
no.

2385
02:29:51.650 --> 02:29:55.280
In my head I'm a little heartbroken.
Like,
oh fuck,
all right.
Whatever.
You know.

2386
02:29:55.790 --> 02:29:57.590
All right,
fuck it.
It is what it is.

2387
02:29:58.700 --> 02:30:03.170
You're in reception for four months.
The first prison I went to was a,

2388
02:30:03.171 --> 02:30:07.220
I meet a counselor.
They evaluate me.
They see how I am as a person.

2389
02:30:07.221 --> 02:30:10.070
What they asked you like,
what did you do before this?

2390
02:30:10.071 --> 02:30:13.430
And I had to put comedian construction worker,
you know,
and they were like,

2391
02:30:13.431 --> 02:30:18.310
all right.
So that's the job they're going to give you.
Uh,

2392
02:30:18.920 --> 02:30:21.710
yeah.
And you have to have a job to be programming.

2393
02:30:21.711 --> 02:30:24.590
And if you have a job now you're allowed to go to yard.

2394
02:30:24.920 --> 02:30:29.150
You're allowed to go do get store,
buy stuff and shit like that.

2395
02:30:30.200 --> 02:30:34.250
And a,
I'm not going to lie,
Tom and Christina,

2396
02:30:34.970 --> 02:30:38.350
I was having the best time of my fucking life.
What,

2397
02:30:39.800 --> 02:30:44.390
why?
What about it is good?
Because it's just like I was,
no,

2398
02:30:44.660 --> 02:30:48.230
there was no stress of getting up.
There was no stress of bills.

2399
02:30:48.260 --> 02:30:51.830
It was just like a dog.
How are we going to survive?
How are we going to eat?

2400
02:30:52.160 --> 02:30:56.090
And I was with a solid group of people.
We all like,

2401
02:30:56.091 --> 02:30:59.710
we all looked out for each other.
Guys had each other's back.
And uh,

2402
02:30:59.810 --> 02:31:03.710
this is a crazy shit is uh,
a white,
a white boy.
Cholo that's half white,

2403
02:31:03.711 --> 02:31:07.310
half met the guy that was my celly,
he,
he,

2404
02:31:07.700 --> 02:31:12.140
he wa he got took out.
He was a medicated,
he was fucking Weirdo.

2405
02:31:12.290 --> 02:31:16.700
Fucking Weirdo.
I remember he tried to scare me one time.
He was like,

2406
02:31:16.701 --> 02:31:19.970
Hey homie,
at night I fucking see demons.
And I said,

2407
02:31:21.960 --> 02:31:24.570
and I was like,
turn the fucking light on it.

2408
02:31:27.360 --> 02:31:31.130
He didn't know what to do.
He was like,
Oh fuck,
I don't match on the line on home.

2409
02:31:31.140 --> 02:31:33.990
We're not going to get in trouble if you turn the light on.
He was just like,
oh,

2410
02:31:33.991 --> 02:31:38.940
all right,
whatever.
So I honestly think to this day that he told,

2411
02:31:39.030 --> 02:31:44.010
cause I was in there working out like fucking,
I was in their work.

2412
02:31:44.011 --> 02:31:47.700
You have to work out.
It's mandatory for my people.

2413
02:31:47.701 --> 02:31:50.370
You have to get up in the morning when we wake up.

2414
02:31:50.910 --> 02:31:53.640
Like say we're in prison right now.
Yeah I'd wake up and,

2415
02:31:53.641 --> 02:31:58.440
but I expand saw him that theater.
This is sharp goon from orange St.

2416
02:31:58.450 --> 02:32:01.510
So rules good morning.
Wendell's Diaz you'd have to say it.

2417
02:32:01.570 --> 02:32:03.540
Nick's really like a roll.

2418
02:32:03.541 --> 02:32:07.380
Call it the white people say instead of good morning you say would morning cause

2419
02:32:07.381 --> 02:32:10.650
they call.
You would yeah.
Good morning.

2420
02:32:10.680 --> 02:32:12.780
This is Tom and then,

2421
02:32:12.781 --> 02:32:16.800
but see I'm not allowed to go eat yet cause I'm with high killer inmates.

2422
02:32:17.490 --> 02:32:21.150
They just open your door and they throw the food in the tray and then you got

2423
02:32:21.151 --> 02:32:22.320
like four minutes to eat it.

2424
02:32:22.321 --> 02:32:27.120
I didn't get the train or some bad mother fuckers in your off dude lip old Tom.

2425
02:32:27.420 --> 02:32:31.900
Tom.
I'm in Bakersfield and uh,
there's a,

2426
02:32:31.901 --> 02:32:36.330
there's a,
there's a,
I've never ever been scared of a crip.

2427
02:32:36.720 --> 02:32:39.390
That was the biggest fucking crimp I've ever seen this full look like.

2428
02:32:39.450 --> 02:32:44.220
He made Busta rhymes look little and he was like Busta rhymes who swore was

2429
02:32:44.221 --> 02:32:48.480
fuck,
he was in there for killing three people.
Stupid ass.
Full shot.

2430
02:32:48.481 --> 02:32:51.510
Someone at a club in the hallway like,
like in the club,

2431
02:32:51.640 --> 02:32:53.550
this will shot fools in the club.

2432
02:32:53.610 --> 02:32:58.440
And he was being a very disrespectful dude.
We,

2433
02:32:58.680 --> 02:33:02.490
I guess other Mexicans fucking stabbed them before this.
Okay.

2434
02:33:02.820 --> 02:33:07.820
And so he decided to piss on one of our doors because when they let you out,

2435
02:33:07.920 --> 02:33:11.190
they,
they use the shower's upstairs.
So we use the showers downstairs.

2436
02:33:11.520 --> 02:33:14.190
Don't ask me why,
but the cops want to see some shit.
Yeah.

2437
02:33:14.370 --> 02:33:16.710
So yeah man,

2438
02:33:16.770 --> 02:33:21.630
that was the biggest fucking dude I've ever seen ever.
And you had to,

2439
02:33:21.780 --> 02:33:23.700
you had to go like,
no,
like whoever,

2440
02:33:23.760 --> 02:33:28.760
like whoever had to get 'em got 'em and I give the homeys Hart who did it

2441
02:33:29.730 --> 02:33:34.250
because yeah,
they got,
we got,
we didn't get them.
But see the thing is,
is if like,

2442
02:33:34.470 --> 02:33:37.500
if you're a threat to us,
we're going to jump you.
Cause when you jump someone,

2443
02:33:37.501 --> 02:33:41.710
they'd get you off that yard and you get ships.
What is,
they call it,
but did,
uh,

2444
02:33:41.730 --> 02:33:45.390
what did they call you?
Like disrespectfully?
Yeah.
Cool.
Other races?

2445
02:33:45.391 --> 02:33:48.720
The blacks or they would call us Mexico's Mexico.

2446
02:33:48.750 --> 02:33:53.660
Beaners wetbacks uh,
fucking chump bottles.
I don't know.

2447
02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:56.270
It's,
that's,

2448
02:33:56.480 --> 02:34:01.480
that's like a word that Mexicans from America made to Mexicans from Mexico.

2449
02:34:03.060 --> 02:34:06.890
Come on homie.
I ain't like I ain't in your pants.
Oh

2450
02:34:09.620 --> 02:34:14.310
yeah.
She'd have to kind of school the Foreign Mexicans how we do it or,

2451
02:34:14.340 --> 02:34:17.970
and then when we go over there,
that's what they call a fucking shot.
And

2452
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:21.570
<v 12>I go get some boots home.
You're gonna fuck those pants.
Oh yeah.</v>

2453
02:34:21.610 --> 02:34:25.080
It's kind of like we slang switch each other and with the

2454
02:34:25.540 --> 02:34:29.410
<v 13>peckerwoods call you guys anything different or no,
not because we're allies.</v>

2455
02:34:29.530 --> 02:34:33.100
Oh you were?
Yeah.
Met Mexicans and whites are allies.

2456
02:34:33.130 --> 02:34:36.550
Like we live by the same code.

2457
02:34:37.030 --> 02:34:39.850
<v 12>You got what you mean?
And the Persians and the Armenians.</v>

2458
02:34:39.851 --> 02:34:41.020
That's why I want to go back to,

2459
02:34:41.500 --> 02:34:44.850
so you said to the Persians in the Armenians also rolling.

2460
02:34:48.470 --> 02:34:52.470
Still Gang Banging.
Paul.
Can I tell you what happened to those guys?
Yeah.

2461
02:34:53.040 --> 02:34:56.440
<v 13>Was they got locked up in California,
joined us.</v>

2462
02:34:56.710 --> 02:34:59.830
I wouldn't say us because they joined the Mexicans.

2463
02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:03.370
And when you get out,
I invest the porch.

2464
02:35:03.371 --> 02:35:08.371
You cause you'd alone longer have rights if you're from a different country like

2465
02:35:08.651 --> 02:35:11.680
that.
Take you to Russia,
Africa.
They don't fuck around.
Get out of here.

2466
02:35:12.370 --> 02:35:15.280
They say shot bows.
Fools to the Middle East.

2467
02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:19.240
<v 12>Oh gotcha.
They were fucking like,
we'll swap that.</v>

2468
02:35:23.010 --> 02:35:25.850
Yeah,
I seen that video.
I don't know who they are.
Those holes are with it.

2469
02:35:25.870 --> 02:35:28.600
They're the real deal.
They look like they're the real deal.
The real deal.

2470
02:35:28.601 --> 02:35:31.440
Motherfuckers will blast on site.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean they,

2471
02:35:31.540 --> 02:35:36.520
I think they put on a little demo in this video.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That is pretty wild.

2472
02:35:36.550 --> 02:35:40.060
Walk me through an average day at prison.
So you wake up,

2473
02:35:40.140 --> 02:35:43.900
I'm not even in prison yet.
This is reception prison.

2474
02:35:43.901 --> 02:35:48.880
This is a four month period.
This is a four month.
So now I wait am my Wasco?
Yeah.

2475
02:35:48.881 --> 02:35:49.580
WASCO.
Oh.

2476
02:35:49.580 --> 02:35:53.780
<v 13>And now I see a counselor and they're like,
all right.
And,
uh,</v>

2477
02:35:54.260 --> 02:35:57.770
my girlfriend at the time was real smart and she goes,
hey,

2478
02:35:57.771 --> 02:35:59.540
if I write them a hardship,

2479
02:36:00.290 --> 02:36:04.850
they'll send you to a prison to closer to us so we can visit you.
So,
you know,

2480
02:36:05.320 --> 02:36:10.130
I was with the smart chick,
so boom,
she does as shit and they send me to Norco.

2481
02:36:10.460 --> 02:36:15.310
Crc.
How's that?
Uh,

2482
02:36:17.990 --> 02:36:22.910
it's not a crazy prison,
but it is,
it's more of a druggie prison.

2483
02:36:23.670 --> 02:36:27.140
It's an old navy barracks in more culture.
I hear it's in Riverside,

2484
02:36:27.141 --> 02:36:30.620
norcal off the 15.
And uh,

2485
02:36:31.010 --> 02:36:35.030
it was pretty fucking scary,
Bro,
because,
uh,
I've never been around other,

2486
02:36:35.450 --> 02:36:39.860
it's a level two yard.
When you're in prison,
there's a level one yard.

2487
02:36:39.861 --> 02:36:42.530
That's where we chunk Tommy Chong.
When he got locked up,

2488
02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:46.760
he was at a level one yard.
It's a,
everyone's going to do two years.

2489
02:36:46.761 --> 02:36:48.530
One year you're going home.

2490
02:36:48.680 --> 02:36:52.370
It's relaxed level two yards is where I'm at.
It's like,

2491
02:36:53.240 --> 02:36:55.990
you know what,
it's chill but shingles down,
right?

2492
02:36:56.180 --> 02:37:00.170
You got people that are coming in from a level three yard just to have fun.

2493
02:37:00.171 --> 02:37:02.270
They're gonna fuck around and go right back.
Right.

2494
02:37:02.390 --> 02:37:06.530
So then level four yard is where I was at originally.

2495
02:37:06.531 --> 02:37:09.110
Like it's just after nine o'clock.
If you say a word,

2496
02:37:09.111 --> 02:37:13.550
you're going to get beat up in the morning.
Rules,
killers,

2497
02:37:13.970 --> 02:37:15.920
gangsters in every,
everywhere.

2498
02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:19.880
<v 2>So,
but compared to where you were at Wasco,</v>

2499
02:37:19.910 --> 02:37:22.430
this is definitely a better situation.
Right.

2500
02:37:22.630 --> 02:37:25.760
<v 12>It is a way better situation.
I liked Wasco though,</v>

2501
02:37:25.790 --> 02:37:30.400
because I got this fog dude.
But he would tell you that.

2502
02:37:30.401 --> 02:37:33.790
Oh Man,
I forgot about that.
WASCO.

2503
02:37:34.030 --> 02:37:38.560
I seen my friends from elementary.
No,
and they were pissed.

2504
02:37:39.310 --> 02:37:43.880
Why Ain't home yet that you're going to be a comedian in Mickey it?
I go,
oh,

2505
02:37:44.830 --> 02:37:48.400
that's got to hurt that though when you,
I mean it didn't hurt,
but it did and it,

2506
02:37:49.090 --> 02:37:53.080
it's something that stays with me now.
But now you're doing it though.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2507
02:37:53.081 --> 02:37:56.770
I remember this one gangster.
My homeboy big sleeps from basset out there.

2508
02:37:56.771 --> 02:37:59.380
Shout out to you.
My boy gave me a lot of knowledge.

2509
02:37:59.620 --> 02:38:04.140
He grabs me and equals a homie.
Uh,

2510
02:38:04.330 --> 02:38:08.380
my son came in home visiting and he seen you and he goes,
that staff full dog.

2511
02:38:08.381 --> 02:38:12.040
He used to do comedy at Casa Latina.
That's that guy.
He's real,

2512
02:38:12.041 --> 02:38:15.070
he's with the business.
He's,
he's funny.
And the dad was like,

2513
02:38:15.640 --> 02:38:20.470
I see you here and I want you to go show the world what gangsters are that we're

2514
02:38:20.471 --> 02:38:23.800
still funny that we could fuck around,
like don't ever come back here.

2515
02:38:24.100 --> 02:38:29.080
And I was like,
wow,
that's some real shit right there.
Odi.
Yeah.
All right.
Well,

2516
02:38:29.110 --> 02:38:32.350
sorry for the sentimental.
No,
I know.
That's great man.
Yeah.

2517
02:38:32.380 --> 02:38:35.440
I never get to talk like this to people.
It's fucking word.
I love this.

2518
02:38:35.700 --> 02:38:38.500
I love this.
Do you know that,
by the way,
this is like an aside

2519
02:38:39.210 --> 02:38:41.200
<v 2>the story before,
but I got to tell you,
I think,</v>

2520
02:38:41.210 --> 02:38:43.710
I don't know if I've told you last time I saw you that,

2521
02:38:43.711 --> 02:38:48.420
so I used to work for this.
Uh,
I don't want to say this family.

2522
02:38:48.450 --> 02:38:51.800
Okay.
In 10 legitimate business and the,

2523
02:38:52.290 --> 02:38:56.970
the mother's Mexican father's white guy and the kids look,

2524
02:38:57.030 --> 02:39:01.860
they look more Latino.
All right.
They look like their mom.
So the kid,

2525
02:39:01.890 --> 02:39:06.210
these are clean cut.
Like they,
you know,
go to school and they,
they,

2526
02:39:06.211 --> 02:39:09.540
they're not bad kids,
but the kid loves tattoo,
the boy,

2527
02:39:10.340 --> 02:39:14.100
he starts getting tattoos all over arms,

2528
02:39:14.101 --> 02:39:19.101
legs in like certain styles that like to the untrained eye you'd be like,

2529
02:39:20.520 --> 02:39:24.090
oh those gang tattoos.
And He kinda liked that.
You know,
he kind of liked,

2530
02:39:24.500 --> 02:39:26.750
they look like bad ass tattoos.
Like,
uh,
like,
uh,

2531
02:39:27.500 --> 02:39:31.950
a lot of teenage boys would write like this looks bad ass.
So,

2532
02:39:31.980 --> 02:39:35.640
and then you know,
people are like,
what is that?
And he would make up,

2533
02:39:35.880 --> 02:39:37.980
oh it's this and that just kind of fucking around.

2534
02:39:38.880 --> 02:39:43.170
He gets pulled over for a DUI or you know,
drunk driving,

2535
02:39:43.800 --> 02:39:48.480
they take them downtown to twin towers and they throw him in.

2536
02:39:48.780 --> 02:39:50.310
Like they just look at him.
Yeah.

2537
02:39:50.460 --> 02:39:53.830
And they just throw them in there like you are whatever.
So you know,

2538
02:39:53.831 --> 02:39:58.410
you're going in here.
So he's in what used to be the gym,

2539
02:39:58.950 --> 02:40:03.930
which is now all bumped up cause it's overpopulated.
Yeah.
Night one.

2540
02:40:04.200 --> 02:40:07.890
So he's in this thing,

2545
02:40:23.921 --> 02:40:28.020

it's so chaotic and so crazy that he's walking me through day by day.

2547
02:40:33.301 --> 02:40:36.090
He's like,

2549
02:40:40.921 --> 02:40:45.120

He said,

so why?
I don't understand why you're not just to,
he goes,

2550
02:40:45.121 --> 02:40:49.710
every time I would call to a guard be like,
like,
here's my situation.

2551
02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:53.970
This is,
you know,
this is not right,
or whatever.
He's like,
Garth.
He would be like,

2552
02:40:53.971 --> 02:40:58.971
shut the fuck up and like he wouldn't even be able to get out because of,

2553
02:40:59.240 --> 02:41:02.140
yeah,
they're like whatever he's trying to and they all think he's bullshit.

2554
02:41:02.141 --> 02:41:03.990
No one's listening to anything.
He says.
He goes,

2555
02:41:03.991 --> 02:41:08.850
it's day six and I haven't taken a shit yet.
I was like,
what?

2556
02:41:09.300 --> 02:41:10.021
He goes,
well,

2557
02:41:10.021 --> 02:41:15.021
I would go to the bathroom and I would sit down and if I was sitting on the

2558
02:41:15.151 --> 02:41:18.660
toilet,
like let's say 20 seconds later,

2559
02:41:19.290 --> 02:41:23.250
just two dudes walk in in,
I'd be so scared that something's about to happen.

2560
02:41:23.530 --> 02:41:26.100
I just pulled my pants up and my body would just shut it down.

2561
02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:31.230
It just kept shutting down.
Anyways,
he lasts,
he,
he lasts out there,

2562
02:41:31.260 --> 02:41:34.650
you know,
I don't know,
like another fucking five,
six days.

2563
02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:39.120
And then they move them to the,
uh,
the valley.
They call it the Hilton,

2564
02:41:39.300 --> 02:41:39.991
like jokingly,

2565
02:41:39.991 --> 02:41:43.080
they call it the Hilton because it's so much better than the towers.

2566
02:41:43.860 --> 02:41:47.100
And then he's there for,
and then he's like,
he goes,
that one's pretty cool.

2567
02:41:47.101 --> 02:41:50.640
I'm like,
you have think you haven't done anything bad?
Like you're just,

2568
02:41:50.641 --> 02:41:54.780
you got a Dui.
He's like,
yeah,
we're playing cards,
having fun.

2569
02:41:54.840 --> 02:41:58.430
It's not because he did something else.
It's not catching.
He,
I don't know.
Well,

2570
02:41:58.431 --> 02:42:00.120
he ends up doing,
he gets out,
uh,

2571
02:42:00.210 --> 02:42:03.600
two weeks late as two weeks for getting pulled over for a Dui.

2572
02:42:03.900 --> 02:42:07.700
He must have been speeding or something.
I think so.
Yeah.
And then they,
um,

2573
02:42:07.850 --> 02:42:11.250
he said they just,
you know,
he finally gets out.
But that dude,

2574
02:42:11.580 --> 02:42:16.580
part of the reason was that he wa he basically tried to look like he was homing.

2575
02:42:17.750 --> 02:42:22.690
Bang.
Yeah.
Oh Shit.
Yeah,
that's,
yeah.
Uh,

2576
02:42:22.710 --> 02:42:27.080
my son has my son's 22.
That's crazy.
Yeah.

2577
02:42:27.780 --> 02:42:31.620
And he's tatted up and I'm,
the first one broke my heart,
but I was like,

2578
02:42:31.621 --> 02:42:32.850

2608
02:44:29.711 --> 02:44:32.260

Yeah,

As the one,

2609
02:44:32.261 --> 02:44:36.310
I forgot that happens in the later time.
Okay.
No,

we'll wait.
Yeah.

2610
02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:42.040
A dude,
it's,
I have nightmares of this shit,
Tom.
Two,
three times a week.

2611
02:44:42.100 --> 02:44:45.610
Fuck,
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to give you nightmares or bring it up.
No,
no,
it's,

2612
02:44:45.700 --> 02:44:50.680
it's,
it's weird cause like,
you know,
uh,
I used to do a lot of fucking coke man.

2613
02:44:51.050 --> 02:44:55.090
It,
that's the only drug that I could do and still be responsible.
Weird Shit.

2614
02:44:55.180 --> 02:44:58.630
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I've been sober now for like 11,

2615
02:44:58.631 --> 02:45:03.490
10 months from coke.
Yeah.
Like all have withdrawals once every two,
three months.

2616
02:45:03.491 --> 02:45:08.260
But it's cool because I'm good and like I haven't done it in like a four months

2617
02:45:08.261 --> 02:45:12.610
solid and my body's like fucking my brain up.

2618
02:45:12.611 --> 02:45:13.331
And then did,

2619
02:45:13.331 --> 02:45:15.970
I had this dream that I was in fucking prison again and it was weird.

2620
02:45:15.971 --> 02:45:19.630
Like I was in prison with my normal clothes and myself when I was like trying to

2621
02:45:19.631 --> 02:45:24.420
throw it away,
I'm gonna get in trouble.
It was all right.
Yeah.
So that,

2622
02:45:25.190 --> 02:45:25.730
yeah,
it's funny,

2623
02:45:25.730 --> 02:45:30.620
the psychology of like what an experience like that does to you for the rest of

2624
02:45:30.621 --> 02:45:35.020
you.
It never leaves you.
It's gotta be a PTSD thing.
My brother said that.

2625
02:45:35.021 --> 02:45:38.080
Sure it is.
It is,
but it's not,

2626
02:45:38.110 --> 02:45:41.960
it's Kinda like being in the marines but you never get to go to war yet.
But,

2627
02:45:42.190 --> 02:45:44.590
but here's the thing,
like bring up my,

2628
02:45:44.620 --> 02:45:49.390
so my dad was in the Marine Corps and he was in Vietnam and he was out in the

2629
02:45:49.480 --> 02:45:53.950
Bush like in the shit.
Yeah.
And Real Shit.
Real Shit.
People,

2630
02:45:54.300 --> 02:45:58.000
you know,
bodies blown up next to him killing people,
people being killed.

2631
02:45:58.600 --> 02:46:01.160
I didn't realize for a long time like you know,

2632
02:46:01.210 --> 02:46:04.960
someone raising me my whole life to where adults now how like,

2633
02:46:05.020 --> 02:46:06.940
cause he was the kind of person who if you're like,

2634
02:46:06.941 --> 02:46:08.350
I want to talk about beating him,
he'd be like,
yeah,
sure.

2635
02:46:08.380 --> 02:46:10.930
Like some people are like,
I don't want to talk about that.
And so you talk,

2636
02:46:10.940 --> 02:46:15.560
you like,
oh you,
it didn't affect you.
It takes a long time to realize,
oh it,

2637
02:46:16.160 --> 02:46:20.510
it tremendously affected you.
It just manifested it differently.
Yes,

2638
02:46:20.930 --> 02:46:21.621
yes.
You know,

2639
02:46:21.621 --> 02:46:26.621
so it definitely like who I know as the,

2640
02:46:26.780 --> 02:46:28.700
as my dad is,

2641
02:46:29.240 --> 02:46:33.850
it truly isn't who he was before that experience.
Fuck No.
And,
and,

2642
02:46:33.940 --> 02:46:36.350
and I'll never know who that guy was.

2643
02:46:36.830 --> 02:46:41.780
Something happens like my son tells me the same shit you said about.

2644
02:46:41.781 --> 02:46:43.100
Yeah,
he goes dad,

2645
02:46:43.370 --> 02:46:47.870
cause my daughter met me when I got out of prison and I was completely fucking

2646
02:46:47.871 --> 02:46:52.250
different.
My sons had me before.
Oh right.

2647
02:46:52.280 --> 02:46:55.880
So they know who that guy was and I remember my kids telling me,

2648
02:46:55.910 --> 02:47:00.910
you remember when you fuck that full up for the parking spot like dog,

2649
02:47:01.250 --> 02:47:02.420
it was black Friday.

2650
02:47:05.820 --> 02:47:10.520
Fuck yeah,
no it,
it,
it has honestly,
man,

2651
02:47:10.521 --> 02:47:11.750
I'm glad I went to prison.

2652
02:47:12.620 --> 02:47:16.910
It made me realize what the consequences were if I do this shit again.

2653
02:47:16.940 --> 02:47:18.950
So you think about it.
Do you ever think about it?

2654
02:47:18.951 --> 02:47:22.010
Like when you get angry about something,
like,
so hey,
oh yeah,

2655
02:47:22.011 --> 02:47:25.300
somebody disrespects you are or you know does something and you're like still

2656
02:47:25.310 --> 02:47:28.160
work at a strip club in the daytime.
You do?
Yeah.

2657
02:47:28.580 --> 02:47:32.600
And get some free passes or anything like that?
Both of you.

2658
02:47:34.070 --> 02:47:36.260
It's a little clammy.

2659
02:47:39.980 --> 02:47:41.720
Uh,
dude,
where I work,

2660
02:47:41.810 --> 02:47:46.280
I have to fucking deal with this shit once a week.
Like I work with us,

2661
02:47:46.281 --> 02:47:50.750
druggies,
homeless people,
real pimps,
real fucking pimps,

2662
02:47:51.410 --> 02:47:52.310
prostitutes.

2663
02:47:52.670 --> 02:47:55.970
And I remember just the other day I was driving and I have to go to this alley

2664
02:47:55.971 --> 02:47:59.210
to leave my work and this fool's like,
fuck you.

2665
02:47:59.230 --> 02:48:03.220
Bhutto so I stopped the car and I reverse it.
And as I'm reversing,

2666
02:48:03.240 --> 02:48:06.420
I'm just thinking about my kids and I was like,
I've got to do,

2667
02:48:06.470 --> 02:48:10.780
showed the store three hours.
What am I fucking doing?
That's good.

2668
02:48:12.860 --> 02:48:16.970
The fucked up part is I had a seat in the next day.
Same Guy.
Same Guy,

2669
02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.240
because they're homeless.
They live in that fucking down.
Right,
right.

2670
02:48:19.350 --> 02:48:22.100
But this is a 25 year old homeless.
Yeah.

2671
02:48:22.430 --> 02:48:26.240
That's just there because he wants to do drugs.
Yeah.
And I remember just going,

2672
02:48:26.241 --> 02:48:28.820
you know what man for your head,
go ahead.
Walk by.

2673
02:48:29.060 --> 02:48:33.500
I one thing about prison is you'll learn to talk to people.

2674
02:48:34.130 --> 02:48:37.100
Cause if you had a problem with me,
you'd walk up to me,
George,
you know,

2675
02:48:37.101 --> 02:48:39.260
while you're looking at me weird at times.

2676
02:48:39.261 --> 02:48:42.680
And I don't know if it's cause you have a problem with me.

2677
02:48:42.681 --> 02:48:46.340
I said something before like so what's up homie?
Do you have a problem or not?

2678
02:48:46.580 --> 02:48:50.720
Because I don't want to live in here thinking mean you have a problem.
Right.

2679
02:48:50.900 --> 02:48:52.550
So I did that to that guy.
Go,
hey man,

2680
02:48:52.670 --> 02:48:55.880
I work right there and you talk shit to me yesterday.

2681
02:48:55.881 --> 02:49:00.000
Like did you not know he was mean or like you know him,
he was all,
yeah.

2682
02:49:00.010 --> 02:49:02.360
And I was just Kinda,
and then you know,
the old gangster came out of me.

2683
02:49:02.361 --> 02:49:04.910
I was like,
yeah,
I knew you were a fucking bitch doc.
Look at you.

2684
02:49:04.911 --> 02:49:08.010
You're 25 you're a disgrace.
Homey.

2685
02:49:08.010 --> 02:49:11.350
<v 13>Like if you get locked up all,
you're going to find out what's really up.
Yeah,</v>

2686
02:49:11.820 --> 02:49:16.770
yeah.
That's crazy.
Yeah.
Shit.

2687
02:49:16.771 --> 02:49:20.420
His pants,
he shit his pants.
He had fucking shotgun.

2688
02:49:22.040 --> 02:49:23.510
The DIY gang.

2689
02:49:25.910 --> 02:49:28.740
I've heard other girls say what you just said right now.

2690
02:49:28.741 --> 02:49:32.730
I said it's fucking funny.
Oh my God.
So,
so,
okay,

2691
02:49:32.731 --> 02:49:36.660
so four months in this first place and then the day and so now you're at,

2692
02:49:36.661 --> 02:49:41.250
you're going home male prison.
Fuck.
What's that process like?

2693
02:49:41.280 --> 02:49:44.340
It's fucking weird cause it's uh,
no,
it's,
it's different.

2694
02:49:44.370 --> 02:49:47.250
It's called a bunkie here too.
Yeah.
Now it's r and R,

2695
02:49:47.251 --> 02:49:51.330
but now I have a bunkie and I'm in a dormitory with a hundred inmates,

2696
02:49:51.360 --> 02:49:55.530
which is better.
Right?
It's better.
But it sucks if it's right at time

2697
02:49:57.090 --> 02:50:00.210
coffee,
you guys write it whenever shit needs to go down.

2698
02:50:00.211 --> 02:50:04.620
But I mean like is the frequency of that like once a month like no,
no,
it can,

2699
02:50:04.650 --> 02:50:08.760
it could go everyday of the week.
It could go like,
oh no,

2700
02:50:08.761 --> 02:50:13.650
for five months it,
whatever's going down,
whatever.
You know,

2701
02:50:14.940 --> 02:50:18.750
prison is a place where it tells you what you need to do.
Right.
You know,

2702
02:50:19.050 --> 02:50:23.580
if someone fucks up and like say you got to go home tomorrow,
Tom Meade,

2703
02:50:23.581 --> 02:50:27.450
you're on the yard and a guard walks up to you and you just spits in your

2704
02:50:27.451 --> 02:50:32.070
fucking face.
We're all looking at you.

2705
02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:38.430
I would be the stupid ass and do something back.
And that instead of saying,
hey,

2706
02:50:38.431 --> 02:50:41.100
Doug,
on a mountain dog,
you could fuck me up today.

2707
02:50:41.160 --> 02:50:43.930
Motherfuckers don't think like that in there.
Oh Geez.

2708
02:50:44.560 --> 02:50:46.980
It's in orange is the new black.
That's the problem.

2709
02:50:47.550 --> 02:50:49.410
When they knew they were getting released,

2710
02:50:49.411 --> 02:50:53.370
the guards would fuck with the girls to try to get them to act out to increase

2711
02:50:53.371 --> 02:50:54.360
their sentences.

2712
02:50:54.361 --> 02:50:57.750
It's really food inmates like you don't even want to tell your homies you're

2713
02:50:57.751 --> 02:51:01.390
going home.
You don't know.
Someone will try to sabotage you owe me get,

2714
02:51:01.530 --> 02:51:06.360
I don't want you to leave dog.
Fuck that shit.
No.
All right,

2715
02:51:06.361 --> 02:51:09.210
so now I'm doing my four year term.
It's uh,

2716
02:51:09.390 --> 02:51:14.390
it was kind of weird because now I'm with gangsters that are druggies at this

2717
02:51:14.551 --> 02:51:18.150
place.
This place is way more like using,
when an alarm goes off,

2718
02:51:18.151 --> 02:51:22.230
it is a riot at this place when the alarm goes off.
So almost running with drugs.

2719
02:51:22.700 --> 02:51:24.030
Really?
Yeah,
Dude.

2720
02:51:24.031 --> 02:51:28.530
It's Day I was at this place called the California hotel,
California.

2721
02:51:29.130 --> 02:51:34.130
It was a building that was 11 stories high and we were all on each story and if

2722
02:51:35.161 --> 02:51:40.161
you walk up you have to walk up the stairs and fuck shit went down in those

2723
02:51:40.531 --> 02:51:44.910
stairs,
really?
Shit went down.
And

2724
02:51:46.530 --> 02:51:48.330
you know,
like,
I dunno,

2725
02:51:48.690 --> 02:51:53.490
people look at prison like it's a constantly getting hit up.

2726
02:51:53.520 --> 02:51:57.690
It's not really like that.
It's like you wake up,
you hang out with your people,

2727
02:51:58.650 --> 02:52:02.610
you're hustling.
Like what?
What?
What are you good at?
Do you know how to draw?

2728
02:52:02.640 --> 02:52:07.050
Do you know how to Kevin,
Chris just here.
He knows how to fucking draw.
Yeah.

2729
02:52:07.090 --> 02:52:09.460
He would have dry heat.
We were talking about what he would've done in prison.

2730
02:52:09.461 --> 02:52:13.200
He said I would draw pictures of like naked chicks straight up or,
yeah.

2731
02:52:13.240 --> 02:52:17.650
Or like some people could draw your mom or your dad.
Oh,
thanks.
Oh Shit.

2732
02:52:17.710 --> 02:52:22.240
Yeah.
Well you could tell jokes,
so yeah.
What did they have?
I like your talent.

2733
02:52:22.241 --> 02:52:26.500
Like I was ready for this.
One of the fucking guards.

2734
02:52:28.590 --> 02:52:29.423
Hey homie.

2735
02:52:30.130 --> 02:52:30.560

Huh?
Oh fuck.

2738
02:52:38.500 --> 02:52:41.980
He goes,

2739
02:52:42.010 --> 02:52:46.660
one of the guards.
Uh,

2740
02:52:48.040 --> 02:52:52.120
Oh fuck.
So I'm doing halftime.
Right.

2741
02:52:52.450 --> 02:52:57.130
So they put me in the program called Sap Sus Substance Abuse Program.

2742
02:52:57.790 --> 02:53:02.770
And in this program I'm with all these fucking lame ass druggies and shit.
Yeah.

2743
02:53:02.970 --> 02:53:06.700
And it's for halftime.
So,
uh,

2744
02:53:08.440 --> 02:53:11.620
my counselor sees me and she's like,
you know what?
There's a mistake.

2745
02:53:13.280 --> 02:53:13.910
<v 17>Okay.</v>

2746
02:53:13.910 --> 02:53:18.550

You can't do halftime.
Halftime.
No.</v>

2747
02:53:18.740 --> 02:53:23.450
Violent crime is 80%.
How far your sentence?

2748
02:53:23.750 --> 02:53:26.140
Yeah.
How much time have you served?
Fast forwarded?
This is two.

2749
02:53:26.300 --> 02:53:29.060
This is a a year and a half.
So you're like,

2750
02:53:29.061 --> 02:53:32.730
I'm about to get a out to get out of here.
Yeah.
Dammit.
Yeah.

2751
02:53:32.870 --> 02:53:34.880
That's gotta be the most crushing thing to hear.

2752
02:53:35.700 --> 02:53:38.870
And I've had a lot of other questions.
Shit.
I mean,
when you're like,

2753
02:53:38.871 --> 02:53:42.770
I'm about to get out of here.
And they're like,
oh no.
Just like nonchalant,
like a,

2754
02:53:42.780 --> 02:53:47.480
I don't give your stuff away.
You're going to do?
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Ah,

2755
02:53:48.200 --> 02:53:51.260
oh fuck.
That was wild.
Wait,
but what was your job?

2756
02:53:52.040 --> 02:53:55.970
My job was wild.
My first job was a yo,
I was on the yard crew.

2757
02:53:56.780 --> 02:53:58.460
Yard crew is,
uh,

2758
02:53:59.270 --> 02:54:03.590
I check out equipment to everybody that's in prison.

2759
02:54:04.520 --> 02:54:08.900
What kind of equipment?
Like a basketball,
uh,

2760
02:54:09.800 --> 02:54:13.750
sandbags to work out.
Cause we,
you would put sand in like a,

2761
02:54:14.090 --> 02:54:16.640
you see this pant leg?
Yeah.
You'd cut it.

2762
02:54:17.030 --> 02:54:21.200
So the bottom put sand in and then put a hole here and those are your wife's

2763
02:54:21.201 --> 02:54:25.540
curls.
Wow.
And uh,
because you can't have the weights.
Oh Hell No.

2764
02:54:26.480 --> 02:54:29.420
When the weights were in,
people were getting killed,
like written right and left.

2765
02:54:29.440 --> 02:54:33.910
I imagine working now and then someone just drops a 45 on your head choirs.

2766
02:54:34.540 --> 02:54:37.240
Yeah,
of course.
That's fine.
Go ahead.
Go ahead

2767
02:54:39.350 --> 02:54:42.650

Oh yeah,

2769
02:54:46.700 --> 02:54:50.670
It's like a fucking celebration.
Yeah.
That's a party I'd go to.

2770
02:54:51.110 --> 02:54:56.110
So I'm in the substance abuse program and the war didn't calls me

2771
02:54:59.060 --> 02:55:00.010

2773
02:55:06.800 --> 02:55:11.190
And if you,

I dress better in prison than I did.
Now wait,

2774
02:55:11.210 --> 02:55:14.360

No cousin.
All right,

2779
02:55:31.130 --> 02:55:34.280
It's weird man.
I ever been in front of a mic.

2780
02:55:34.610 --> 02:55:39.380
Probably a year and a half.

2782
02:55:43.340 --> 02:55:46.070

2785
02:55:52.700 --> 02:55:54.650
and this is the fucked up part is like fuck full.

2786
02:55:54.651 --> 02:55:57.050
If you show them how funny you are now,

2787
02:55:57.110 --> 02:56:00.090
everyone's going to want to fuck you.

2788
02:56:02.420 --> 02:56:07.160
Oh,
that happened to me now.
And uh,
fuck it though.

2789
02:56:07.161 --> 02:56:10.430
You know how those demons are.
I'm going to fucking kill this bitch.

2790
02:56:11.530 --> 02:56:16.370
I murder dude murdered because they haven't seen that.

2791
02:56:16.550 --> 02:56:20.150
They haven't seen copy.
Of course.
Gangsters,
druggies.

2792
02:56:20.180 --> 02:56:24.770
And Yeah,
dude,
I started this song,
Rogan man.
It was cool.

2793
02:56:24.771 --> 02:56:26.120
He was just like,
hey man,

2794
02:56:26.150 --> 02:56:29.330
you can take the rest of that Kentucky fried chicken and that two liter Dr

2795
02:56:29.331 --> 02:56:32.780
Pepper back to your pad.
And I remember going back to my gel,

2796
02:56:32.781 --> 02:56:35.570
saw what that shit everybody like walked off

2797
02:56:37.220 --> 02:56:39.320
and I gave it to all.
I gave it to everybody we ate.

2798
02:56:41.270 --> 02:56:44.610
So do they,
do you tell them why at the time or do you still hold onto that?
No,

2799
02:56:44.630 --> 02:56:47.900
I told him.
You told him you gotta remember I'm,
I'm in the hotel.

2800
02:56:47.901 --> 02:56:50.690
There's three other,
there's three other yards to this prison.

2801
02:56:50.691 --> 02:56:52.350
I'm in the drug program.
Right.

2802
02:56:52.540 --> 02:56:55.730
So now that that we find out I'm not supposed to be in this program,

2803
02:56:55.731 --> 02:57:00.650
they send me to the three side God and I'm loving it.

2804
02:57:00.680 --> 02:57:04.460
I'm cool.
I mean,
dude,
I can,
I'm loving this shit.

2805
02:57:04.730 --> 02:57:06.890
I don't want to be with drug is I want to be with gang members.

2806
02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:12.110
As weird as that sounds,
I actually think it makes sense.
Yeah.

2807
02:57:12.890 --> 02:57:17.270
No,
they're like,
they're on fucking pills meds as the fucking dude.

2808
02:57:17.271 --> 02:57:21.200
I remember snorting Seroquel,
Seroquel.

2809
02:57:21.230 --> 02:57:24.170
It's a even heard of that.
It's a,

2810
02:57:25.100 --> 02:57:29.630
I guess suicide thoughts or like if you hear people speaking in your head,

2811
02:57:29.631 --> 02:57:34.180
you take this drug,
whoa dude.
Get your schizophrenia.
Yes.

2812
02:57:34.740 --> 02:57:35.070
Yeah.

2813
02:57:35.070 --> 02:57:40.070
And I remember we were sniffing it because we're bored as far course African

2814
02:57:40.260 --> 02:57:44.740
snippet.
Yeah.
For Real.
So now,

2837

2841
02:59:25.090 --> 02:59:28.850

Nine fucking no mine.
Yeah,

2847
02:59:46.900 --> 02:59:50.460
How so you trained a couple of guys to like kick things off.
Like,

2848
02:59:50.500 --> 02:59:52.300
like you know when you meet so many you're like,

2849
02:59:52.301 --> 02:59:56.050

2850
02:59:56.080 --> 02:59:58.180
You don't know the setup tag.
You don't know none of that.

2851
02:59:58.181 --> 03:00:00.340
So I helped them with their shit.
Shut up.
Yeah.

2852
03:00:00.341 --> 03:00:04.720
This waffle with fucking anything was Rico.
He's a fucking big old tweaker.

2853
03:00:05.170 --> 03:00:07.900
He got locked up because,
uh,

2854
03:00:11.340 --> 03:00:15.430
you know,
uh,
I guess there's like a base around here,
Los Alamitos base or okay.

2855
03:00:15.880 --> 03:00:20.110
And he would,
he would jump into like the water and steel,

2856
03:00:20.111 --> 03:00:24.430
like muscle and sell it.
Like he was a Druggie,
so he would still,

2857
03:00:24.431 --> 03:00:25.910
Koi fish is from Manchester.

2858
03:00:28.640 --> 03:00:33.470
He will smooth,
those things are expensive.
Quite are like $1,000,
you know,

2859
03:00:33.490 --> 03:00:36.160
you know when you need a smart drug.
He was definitely,
he was fucked.

2860
03:00:36.161 --> 03:00:40.300
And he had this one joke that kill me.
He a fuck the teeth is like,
Yay.

2861
03:00:40.420 --> 03:00:44.410
I used to cut girls on the party line and I would tell them I'm chisel.

2862
03:00:45.550 --> 03:00:50.060
It just killed me.
He did it better.
But uh,
yeah,
man,
I did a,

2863
03:00:50.280 --> 03:00:53.560
I got,
would you,
how would you open like your prison show?
You what I mean?

2864
03:00:53.561 --> 03:00:56.740
Like when you got up there though,
this full brought me up the smoothest.

2865
03:00:56.770 --> 03:01:01.030
He was like,
you could see them on showtime.
You could see him on the yard now.

2866
03:01:04.920 --> 03:01:08.830
Yeah.
No,
I mean I would just fucking,
I would come out,
I mean it was,

2867
03:01:09.700 --> 03:01:12.970
look,
Mexican people don't get disrespected by this.
All right.

2868
03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:16.750
But it's fucking easy to do a Mexican show because there's not that many Mexican

2869
03:01:16.751 --> 03:01:19.580
comedians.
Right.
You know what I'm saying by that.

2870
03:01:19.730 --> 03:01:23.180
So I would just go up there and it's boom.
So last time I know,

2871
03:01:23.200 --> 03:01:26.830
I know what to do and then I'd give them the,
the,
the,
the smart part of that.

2872
03:01:27.040 --> 03:01:31.000
Yeah.
But uh,
how long would you do a set for?
40 30.

2873
03:01:33.130 --> 03:01:36.570
Hadn't done it for a minute,
but you know,
I was writing.
Oh,

2874
03:01:36.620 --> 03:01:40.880
so you were still thinking?
Yeah,
I was thinking,
but it was dumb shit.
Dumb.

2875
03:01:41.210 --> 03:01:45.160
Yeah.
Yeah.
He also had to make it for like the world you're in

2876
03:01:47.440 --> 03:01:50.470
the food,
you know,
you're talking shit about like the,

2877
03:01:50.650 --> 03:01:55.030
he can't talk to you about the Cos,
right?
No.
Yeah.
But I did it.
It was more like,

2878
03:01:57.050 --> 03:01:59.530
yeah,
that's a great question.
Are you talking about like,

2879
03:01:59.531 --> 03:02:04.210
Yo is Thursday we're going to shower today?
Mother shower everyday?
I don't know.

2880
03:02:04.211 --> 03:02:08.160
Mandatory mandatory two times.
Two Times.
Yeah.
Two Times.

2881
03:02:08.500 --> 03:02:12.430
I would get up at five in the morning and then shower and then I was uh,

2882
03:02:12.460 --> 03:02:15.860
I was a butcher,
I was a,
I was,
here's my second job.
I'm the,

2883
03:02:15.970 --> 03:02:20.010
I'm the lead man and the butcher shop and uh,
you get that.

2884
03:02:20.160 --> 03:02:22.810
It was cool man.
Christina,

2885
03:02:22.811 --> 03:02:26.710
they gave me a blue jumpsuit or like a mechanics.
I didn't feel like an inmate.

2886
03:02:26.711 --> 03:02:31.180
I had fire man boots,
thermal under beanie,
black gloves,

2887
03:02:31.360 --> 03:02:36.100
big ass Dickies jacket.
And you have to wash your clothes so there's no washer.

2888
03:02:36.101 --> 03:02:37.300
So after you work,

2889
03:02:37.330 --> 03:02:41.920
you wash your clothes in the shower with soap and take it off.

2890
03:02:42.400 --> 03:02:45.850
You can't get up every day.
You had to wash your clothes by hand after work.

2891
03:02:45.880 --> 03:02:50.590
No Shit.
Jesus Christ.
Okay.
Walk me through your day.

2892
03:02:50.620 --> 03:02:53.290
So it's 5:36 AM five 30.

2893
03:02:53.570 --> 03:02:57.580
It's at four 30 in the guard will walk by and be like,
Perez,
wake up.

2894
03:02:57.610 --> 03:03:00.730
You've got to go to work.
I know you,
I know your routine.
Go ahead.

2895
03:03:00.731 --> 03:03:03.280
Jump in the shower cause you're not allowed to be in the showers at those times

2896
03:03:04.930 --> 03:03:08.410
to shower alone.
Well,
it can wait.
Now I'm in a dormitory.

2897
03:03:08.411 --> 03:03:11.350
So there were showers and restrooms.
You could use a restroom,

2898
03:03:11.351 --> 03:03:14.390
but the showers and a lot of turn on unless it's for a worker.
Okay.

2899
03:03:14.800 --> 03:03:18.520
Because people will go in there and shit happens.
What kind of Shit?

2900
03:03:19.210 --> 03:03:23.110
Like fucking stabbings,
druggie drugs and the cops,

2901
03:03:23.380 --> 03:03:27.220
the cops are like bay overpaid babysitters.
They're more like,
look,

2902
03:03:27.221 --> 03:03:29.140
you're not gonna get in trouble if you're fucking in your bunk,

2903
03:03:29.260 --> 03:03:33.400
so stay in your bunk.
That's all they want.
You know?
And uh,

2904
03:03:33.730 --> 03:03:37.540
so I get up,
boom.
My homeboy peewee,
he worked at me,

2905
03:03:38.020 --> 03:03:40.330
saw pee wee.
I know you're not listening,
but what's up?

2906
03:03:42.820 --> 03:03:46.240
He was,
he was the guy that got me the job,
actually saw that.
Love this guy.

2907
03:03:47.020 --> 03:03:50.190
We still talk to this day.
So he got out and uh,

2908
03:03:51.190 --> 03:03:55.660
we would go to work.
So now the card leave,

2909
03:03:55.690 --> 03:03:56.890
you leave your building,

2910
03:03:56.891 --> 03:03:59.720
you're walking down the hallway and you have an identification card.

2911
03:04:00.230 --> 03:04:03.740
And on the back of it,
it tells the other guards your duties.

2912
03:04:03.741 --> 03:04:05.210
He's a lot of B at this time.

2913
03:04:05.780 --> 03:04:09.440
He's allowed to go to this cause I had to leave my yard to go to another yard to

2914
03:04:09.441 --> 03:04:13.160
go to the kitchen.
And it's everyone that works early is going,

2915
03:04:13.190 --> 03:04:14.960
but when you're in the butcher shop,

2916
03:04:17.300 --> 03:04:21.290
I had to cut enough meat for every inmate in all the prisons.
So you know,

2917
03:04:21.291 --> 03:04:22.490
I know my math,
I'm smart,

2918
03:04:22.491 --> 03:04:25.070
but I graduated high school and went to junior college for one year.

2919
03:04:25.530 --> 03:04:27.620
You know what I mean?
I'm one one semester.
I didn't say one year,

2920
03:04:27.621 --> 03:04:30.500
one semester or one quarter,
whatever the shit me maybe a couple months.

2921
03:04:31.070 --> 03:04:35.960
And I was the shit at that.
Like when we would steal,
I wouldn't steal.

2922
03:04:35.961 --> 03:04:39.860
I would put it like,
look,
we sent this there,
but it never got there.
We took it.

2923
03:04:40.550 --> 03:04:44.150
So yeah.
So okay,
sorry,
I'm jumping ahead a jump.
Crazy.

2924
03:04:45.170 --> 03:04:47.750
So now you have to go through a checkpoint.
The guard search,

2925
03:04:47.751 --> 03:04:52.751
you go into the kitchen and then you meet up with all your coworkers and that's

2926
03:04:54.021 --> 03:04:58.820
the best shit.
You know why I'm surrounded by eggs all.

2927
03:04:58.880 --> 03:05:02.900
I wouldn't make bomb Brett.
We would have French toast,
scrambled eggs.

2928
03:05:03.140 --> 03:05:07.820
How often?
Every morning,
every morning I'm in charge of the food.

2929
03:05:07.850 --> 03:05:11.960
That's the shit.
And the guards,
the guards,
the guards were like,

2930
03:05:11.961 --> 03:05:14.210
this fucker's doing comedy for the whole reason

2931
03:05:16.820 --> 03:05:20.690
you're privileged side.
No,
no,
no.
That was along the same lines is like,

2932
03:05:21.020 --> 03:05:25.550
so the guards were cool with you having this great feast every morning?
No,

2933
03:05:25.610 --> 03:05:29.450
they didn't know because they didn't know the guards in and charge,

2934
03:05:29.451 --> 03:05:29.871
you know more.

2935
03:05:29.871 --> 03:05:34.490
There's this thing called free staff is they hire people that are in charge of

2936
03:05:34.910 --> 03:05:35.390
like,

2937
03:05:35.390 --> 03:05:39.260
these people have worked at juveniles and now they want to make more money so

2938
03:05:39.261 --> 03:05:42.800
they go get a job at a prison.
Like you got a dentist in a prison,

2939
03:05:42.801 --> 03:05:47.060
that's free staff.
You have uh,
you know,
what's that shit called?

2940
03:05:47.070 --> 03:05:51.380
Psychiatrists.
Counselors.
Those are all free staff people that are making like,

2941
03:05:51.700 --> 03:05:56.240
do you want to be a cook for 18 bucks or be a $45 an hour cook in prison.
Oh Wow.

2942
03:05:56.270 --> 03:06:00.190
Jesus.
Because there's a risk.
I might stab you.
Right.
All right.

2943
03:06:03.940 --> 03:06:08.060
That is a job.
Are there any female employees?

2944
03:06:08.780 --> 03:06:13.340
Oh yeah.
Ladies that look like me.

So what's up with sex?

2946
03:06:17.880 --> 03:06:20.570
Do you miss being around,

2947
03:06:20.960 --> 03:06:25.570
women's so much or does it part of your mind just adapt to the,
you know,

2948
03:06:25.850 --> 03:06:29.300
I'm glad I fuck,
I'm never been a pervert to that point of view of,

2949
03:06:29.301 --> 03:06:33.230
but like there's a price to pay for that.
Like if you get,

2950
03:06:33.290 --> 03:06:36.890
if you get caught jacking off,
it's kind of like disrespectful to somebody.

2951
03:06:36.891 --> 03:06:39.530
So I wasn't even more like really I'm marijuana time.

2952
03:06:39.531 --> 03:06:44.240
I jacked off once taking a shit cause I was just like fuck,

2953
03:06:44.360 --> 03:06:48.890
I'm taking it.
I remember free staff,
free staff was like,
cool,

2954
03:06:48.950 --> 03:06:51.560
go use that restroom.
You have to hurt me.
Cut,
meet her restroom.

2955
03:06:51.860 --> 03:06:56.130
I'll just fuck tissue.
And it came back,
I was out,
I had a bomb one.

2956
03:06:56.160 --> 03:07:00.810
Like I don't know,
like I would smell women and that would fuck me up.
Yeah,
yeah,

2957
03:07:00.811 --> 03:07:05.280
yeah.
The smell of perfume or where do you jerk off on the toilet?
Do you do know?

2958
03:07:05.281 --> 03:07:08.090
Sitting down.
So you just look like you're shitting.

2959
03:07:09.570 --> 03:07:12.840
That's your regular spot though.
And that's not,
I mean,
every like,
okay,

2960
03:07:12.841 --> 03:07:15.630
so like say this is a bunk.
All right.

2961
03:07:17.660 --> 03:07:20.520
Yeah.
Right here.
You have a curtain right here,

2962
03:07:22.600 --> 03:07:27.240
Kurt.
Okay.
Can I tap your bunkie on top a homie.
Hey,

2963
03:07:27.760 --> 03:07:30.870
here's a little,
here's a little cinnamon roll for you dog.
Let me give mine.

2964
03:07:31.320 --> 03:07:34.900
Really?
Yeah.
And that was,
that was that cue?

2965
03:07:34.901 --> 03:07:39.360
Like to either get out or just chill?
No,
it was just like,
Yo,
dog.

2966
03:07:39.361 --> 03:07:43.230
I'm going to bust a nut.
Keep pointing for me.
Okay.
Key point meaning,
watch out.

2967
03:07:43.830 --> 03:07:47.850
Point is like,
so what do they expect?

2968
03:07:47.851 --> 03:07:51.210
You guys who would never jerk off.
Yeah,
but it's for other inmates,

2969
03:07:51.211 --> 03:07:52.350
for other races.

2970
03:07:53.010 --> 03:07:56.040
Like you don't want to start a war with the whites because you're looking at

2971
03:07:56.041 --> 03:07:58.980
this white dude jacking off.
Right?
Or The black guy.
You know what I mean?

2972
03:07:58.981 --> 03:08:03.510
You don't want to start a war.
So I'll say eight dog,
cover yourself.
Go handle it.

2973
03:08:03.540 --> 03:08:08.220
It's weird.
Plus you don't want to be caught by your enemy jacking off.

2974
03:08:08.220 --> 03:08:12.890
They keep pointing for me,
dog.
Something happens,
let me know.
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh Wow.

2975
03:08:12.900 --> 03:08:16.680
So you would target me.
So let's say I'm working.

2976
03:08:16.860 --> 03:08:20.940
Oh hell yeah.
That's hard.
What am I,
what's my job at the prison?

2977
03:08:21.430 --> 03:08:21.871
Let's just,

2978
03:08:21.871 --> 03:08:26.871
let's just say you're a dentist and you have to have inmates work for you now.

2979
03:08:27.650 --> 03:08:32.340
Oh fuck.
Because you're x-rays.
We got to go do your paperwork.
So,

2980
03:08:32.640 --> 03:08:35.550
you know,
it starts off.
Good morning.
Hi.
And then you're bored.

2981
03:08:35.551 --> 03:08:39.150
You're there 12 hours a day.
I'm writing you love letters.

2982
03:08:39.270 --> 03:08:43.440

2984
03:08:49.880 --> 03:08:54.330

2985
03:08:54.540 --> 03:08:58.080
I don't eat sugar.
I don't need salt.
I work out every day.
The meat.

2986
03:08:58.081 --> 03:09:00.510
You're got the prime meat eating your breakfast.

2987
03:09:00.511 --> 03:09:04.850
Your ass fucking fucking gorilla.
Yeah,

2988
03:09:04.860 --> 03:09:08.850
I wish I had that body.
Ah,
AH,
prison body.
So wait.

2989
03:09:08.851 --> 03:09:12.120
And then if you,
if you connect with like the female,

2990
03:09:12.520 --> 03:09:17.190

Hustle.
So I'm going to convince you,

2991
03:09:17.191 --> 03:09:19.530
Homegrown.

2992
03:09:19.531 --> 03:09:21.770

Hey,

this is,
I've never seen it,
but I've heard of it.

3001
03:10:00.100 --> 03:10:03.540
I almost,
there was a CEO.
I don't want her to fuck me.
Really?
Yeah.

3002
03:10:03.830 --> 03:10:07.270
I know this shit for real.
And uh,

3003
03:10:08.110 --> 03:10:12.250
it happens usually it happens everywhere,
but it usually happens on the,

3004
03:10:12.251 --> 03:10:17.251
like the higher yards where it's just like you're bored.

3005
03:10:18.130 --> 03:10:20.080
You don't have a husband.
Right.

3006
03:10:20.680 --> 03:10:25.050
<v 3>And all this mail and shit ass motherfucker.

3007
03:10:25.060 --> 03:10:27.660
You never been fuck like that before.
Right?

3008
03:10:27.730 --> 03:10:32.730
I'm doing a thousand burpees a day right from Mantech who are all about the lady

3009
03:10:34.600 --> 03:10:38.980
knew Morrissey drawing.
Fucking smashing.
Yeah.

3010
03:10:39.220 --> 03:10:42.730
Yeah.
No.
Well,
let me ask you this.
You got to start going to prison.

3011
03:10:43.100 --> 03:10:46.990
There's a consequence of this because if you get caught,
oh I'm going to prison.

3012
03:10:47.050 --> 03:10:51.010
No,
your night losing my license.
At least this mother fucker rate me.
He's,

3013
03:10:51.070 --> 03:10:54.250
oh right.
Oh fuck.
Now you're

3014
03:10:54.330 --> 03:10:58.650
<v 13>fuck the guy is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There was when I was there,
when I,</v>

3015
03:10:58.740 --> 03:10:59.431
when I left,

3016
03:10:59.431 --> 03:11:02.100
cause I still kept in contact with some of the guys I was locked up with.

3017
03:11:02.160 --> 03:11:04.260
They were like,
Hey,
remember that chicken?
I was trying to bone you.

3018
03:11:04.500 --> 03:11:07.970
She was born in another inmate and it's it.
It,
it,

3019
03:11:07.971 --> 03:11:11.910
it happens with guards too.
Yeah.
It happens with everybody.
Counselors.

3020
03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:16.740
It's isolated world too.
You know.
Feel like an opera.

3021
03:11:16.770 --> 03:11:17.500
Yeah.
Yeah.

3022
03:11:17.500 --> 03:11:22.180
<v 3>Now I'm going to ask you what about butt sex?
Oh,</v>

3023
03:11:22.230 --> 03:11:23.470
I'm not saying you do it.

3024
03:11:23.500 --> 03:11:28.150
I'm saying have you heard everybody that the stereotype is that rape is the big

3025
03:11:28.151 --> 03:11:31.090
fear.
Every guy I know and that fear of going to prison,
I'm going to get right,

3026
03:11:31.120 --> 03:11:35.590
I'm going to get raped,
I'm going to get rid of.
So how true is that?
Ah,

3027
03:11:39.170 --> 03:11:42.050
<v 13>you're only going to get raped if you're a bitch,</v>

3028
03:11:42.920 --> 03:11:46.220
you're not going to get rid because it's not allowed.
It's,
it's uh,

3029
03:11:47.480 --> 03:11:51.230
it's fucking more frowned upon than anything really.

3030
03:11:51.380 --> 03:11:54.860
Gay activity in prison is like,
Yo,
homie,
you're done.

3031
03:11:54.890 --> 03:11:57.740
Like they're going to kill you.
Like there was a guy going home,

3032
03:11:57.950 --> 03:12:01.760
this happened in another,
another dorm next to mine,
three months.

3033
03:12:02.990 --> 03:12:07.070
God,
his Dick Suck on another man,
convinced them to let him suck his dick.

3034
03:12:07.430 --> 03:12:11.420
And somebody seen it.
It was three in the morning in the fucking showers.

3035
03:12:12.020 --> 03:12:16.740
I remember being on yard this day.
Chelan you know,

3036
03:12:16.741 --> 03:12:20.150
uh,
if it's baseball season,
they check our baseball bats.

3037
03:12:20.810 --> 03:12:22.560
If it's football season,
the checkoff football,

3038
03:12:22.561 --> 03:12:26.030
it's baseball season and that they were having a tournament.

3039
03:12:26.090 --> 03:12:28.880
The guys had their bats and balls and they killed this motherfucker,

3040
03:12:29.210 --> 03:12:34.040
the one who god is,
but your own race has to handle it.

3041
03:12:34.850 --> 03:12:39.140
They killed them.
Killed him.
Fuck.
Yeah.
And I was just like,
it's,

3042
03:12:39.250 --> 03:12:40.490
it's not to be played.

3043
03:12:41.550 --> 03:12:43.940
<v 3>That's kind of a myth.
Real.</v>

3044
03:12:46.670 --> 03:12:50.690
Yeah.
I mean that's,
well,
I mean that you're going to get out a mix.

3045
03:12:50.720 --> 03:12:51.740
It's of like,

3046
03:12:52.430 --> 03:12:56.420
<v 12>remember what I said,
that's what our race is.
Do Gotcha.</v>

3047
03:12:56.780 --> 03:13:00.080
Are Racist.
Don't play that shit.
I don't know what those other races are playing.

3048
03:13:00.110 --> 03:13:04.940
I'm sorry your us too.
And I'm so excited I get to be in part part of your crew.

3049
03:13:04.990 --> 03:13:08.420
We listen.
Let me ask you something about loyalty real quick.

3050
03:13:09.180 --> 03:13:12.340
God Sake.
I love you guys.

3051
03:13:14.360 --> 03:13:15.460
I have a feeling

3052
03:13:15.700 --> 03:13:17.750
<v 2>no.
How's this going to go?
So no you don't.</v>

3053
03:13:17.751 --> 03:13:20.720
I'm going to pitch you a hypothetical scenario.

3054
03:13:21.130 --> 03:13:25.130
Can you tell me your opinion on it?
Okay.
All right.
So,

3055
03:13:26.360 --> 03:13:30.710
um,
obviously married to this lady here for,
uh,
10 years together.

3056
03:13:30.711 --> 03:13:33.440
15 total.
Right.
And in this scenario,

3057
03:13:33.441 --> 03:13:37.210
would I tell her is I like my ice coffee a certain way.
Okay.

3058
03:13:37.940 --> 03:13:42.110
And a lot of times I go and it's not made to,

3059
03:13:42.111 --> 03:13:45.710
my satisfaction is frustrating.
So I've learned to ordered a certain way.

3060
03:13:45.950 --> 03:13:49.610
I make certain amount,
you know,
to fix,
to get it the way I like it.

3061
03:13:50.120 --> 03:13:54.230
So what I was telling her was like,
what if in this hypothetical scenario,

3062
03:13:54.710 --> 03:13:59.300
one day I kept going the same coffee place I always go and I felt like this

3063
03:13:59.301 --> 03:14:03.700
person wasn't purposely disrespecting the way I want my coffee.
No,
wait a minute.

3064
03:14:03.710 --> 03:14:07.400
You haven't a dad detail.
They were purposely disrespecting you.

3065
03:14:07.790 --> 03:14:12.010
Well this is an added detail.
Okay.
They're making it income,
not targeting you.

3066
03:14:12.070 --> 03:14:14.910
<v 12>Yeah.
We're not going to make your coffee.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

3067
03:14:14.920 --> 03:14:19.540
They were not like fuck your coffee Barista.
My bad.

3068
03:14:19.560 --> 03:14:21.790
I didn't mean to make it like go pee.
Okay.
I've told you

3069
03:14:22.140 --> 03:14:23.370
<v 2>fucking times how I like it.</v>

3070
03:14:23.790 --> 03:14:28.790
So this time what happens is this person's shift ends and I just happened to be

3071
03:14:30.961 --> 03:14:32.820
waiting.
Oh

3072
03:14:35.790 --> 03:14:40.790
<v 12>look at him light up when they walk back to the right.</v>

3073
03:14:41.300 --> 03:14:45.410
<v 2>Correct.
Like a Christmas tree.
I grab my,
pull him into the bushes.</v>

3074
03:14:45.860 --> 03:14:47.930
I smashed his head against the pavement.

3075
03:14:47.960 --> 03:14:51.800
I stomp on his neck and I break his neck to make sure it's broken.

3076
03:14:52.160 --> 03:14:56.690
And then I put them in the trunk of my car and I go home.
She's out.
She's,

3077
03:14:56.691 --> 03:14:59.330
you know,
doing check shit,
get her nails done or something.

3078
03:14:59.750 --> 03:15:03.470
She comes home and she's like,
what's up?
I go,
I got to tell you something.

3079
03:15:03.800 --> 03:15:08.330
All right.
Had a little,
I had an oopsie this morning.
Uh,

3080
03:15:08.660 --> 03:15:11.840
I was going to get coffee.
You know that fucking idiot.
He never makes it right.

3081
03:15:12.770 --> 03:15:15.650
I killed him.
He's in the trunk now.

3082
03:15:16.340 --> 03:15:19.710
Does your loyal spouse of 10 years,

3083
03:15:19.720 --> 03:15:22.160
the two small children and the for all right,

3084
03:15:22.190 --> 03:15:27.190
we need to figure out how we're going to deal with the situation or here's

3085
03:15:27.561 --> 03:15:30.260
scenario number to call the cops

3086
03:15:33.270 --> 03:15:37.500
<v 12>while he's thinking about it.
He's a thoughtful guy.
Well,
I'm only to,</v>

3087
03:15:37.501 --> 03:15:41.520
the point is,
is if I'm Christina,
I'm like,
does this full beat mean?

3088
03:15:41.521 --> 03:15:46.230
Does he take my money?
Does it let me spend?
No,
he's,
he's good to me.

3089
03:15:46.231 --> 03:15:48.630
If he's only been addictive foods that make coffee.

3090
03:15:50.420 --> 03:15:54.750
<v 13>Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm fucking back in my boy up.</v>

3091
03:15:54.930 --> 03:15:59.760
Thank you very much.
Yeah.
Big Girl Voice of reason has spoken.
George,

3092
03:15:59.761 --> 03:16:02.450
I hear what you're saying.
Is He a good man mate?
Only.

3093
03:16:02.460 --> 03:16:05.640
Only because you're the father of the children.
You're doing it for the kids now,

3094
03:16:05.641 --> 03:16:07.440
but like at the end of the day,
you know what Fucker,

3095
03:16:07.650 --> 03:16:08.850
you're not drinking coffee no more

3096
03:16:19.730 --> 03:16:24.030
rolling Boone this year.
One no more coffee for you.
Yeah.

3097
03:16:24.810 --> 03:16:27.840
Yeah,
I didn't think about that.
That's some shit.

3098
03:16:27.900 --> 03:16:32.710
You really trip on motherfuckers for coffee like that.
Ship them.
Yeah.
Oh,

3099
03:16:32.720 --> 03:16:36.390
then I would trip if you tipped,
you got a trip?
Yeah.
I said well to yeah,

3100
03:16:36.391 --> 03:16:38.400
I tip well,
yeah,
I,
I,
I,

3101
03:16:38.850 --> 03:16:42.510
I get it from the Strip club and your words if you,
but if they,
if they,

3102
03:16:42.780 --> 03:16:46.620
if I tip good and you're taking forever.
I don't like that shit.
It is.

3103
03:16:46.621 --> 03:16:50.040
You're good.
You're good.
I got your back now.
Thanks man.
Yeah.
All right.
Well,

3104
03:16:50.041 --> 03:16:53.200
let's say he's never,
he's never exhibited.
And I tell you this,

3105
03:16:53.210 --> 03:16:56.940
I go behavior before I tell you what,
what's wild about her in this scenario?

3106
03:16:56.970 --> 03:17:01.290
She's so calm.
Well,
no,
she,
she'll fucking wrong.
One of the culture,
the scenario,

3107
03:17:01.560 --> 03:17:04.410
she's like,
yeah,
no.
I called the cops and I immediately,
immediately,

3108
03:17:04.411 --> 03:17:08.670
why I go wait by George.
She goes,
what if you decided to kill me in the kids?

3109
03:17:08.671 --> 03:17:11.020
And I'm like,
why do you know why he wouldn't talk?

3110
03:17:11.030 --> 03:17:15.150
Because he told you how do you oh interesting.
Because he confessed to me,

3111
03:17:15.210 --> 03:17:17.400
here's my concern.
He's a normal guy.

3112
03:17:17.401 --> 03:17:20.250
Otherwise one day because his coffee isn't made right,

3113
03:17:20.251 --> 03:17:25.251
he snaps and he kills the guy that leads me to believe there's a screw loose.

3114
03:17:25.261 --> 03:17:27.160
He's snorting Saran offenders.

3115
03:17:28.740 --> 03:17:29.560
<v 5>Huh?</v>

3116
03:17:29.560 --> 03:17:32.350
<v 13>Or You could look at it like fuck cause homies crazy.</v>

3117
03:17:32.770 --> 03:17:37.630
He's never yelled or hit me.
Right.
I fuck up all the time.
He fucking loves me.

3118
03:17:37.631 --> 03:17:41.080
He's tripping on fools that make coffee came on them and I'm over here not doing

3119
03:17:41.081 --> 03:17:44.260
shit.
Yeah.
Also like how cool is that?

3120
03:17:44.261 --> 03:17:46.480
Your husband's so passionate about something,
get the fuck out of here,

3121
03:17:47.830 --> 03:17:48.341
but you know,

3122
03:17:48.341 --> 03:17:51.970
real psychos and that's a real cycle move to kill a man cause he didn't make

3123
03:17:51.971 --> 03:17:55.560
your coffee.
Right.
That's kind of like a,
I don't know.

3124
03:17:55.600 --> 03:17:58.690
I mean I keep telling the guy how many times I gotta tell him straight up.

3125
03:17:58.720 --> 03:18:02.230
I mean,
yeah,
like extra ice pitch.
Like put it in there,
but here's the problem.

3126
03:18:02.830 --> 03:18:05.860
What if I help them get rid of the body?
You can't.
You can't.

3127
03:18:05.890 --> 03:18:08.980
That's when you just gotta be like,
Yo Homie,
I'll see you at the next city.

3128
03:18:09.250 --> 03:18:13.420
That's it.
Wait,
what cm in the next city?
Meaning he gets rid of the body.

3129
03:18:13.421 --> 03:18:15.250
I take the kids and we go.
Yeah.
The thing is,

3130
03:18:15.251 --> 03:18:19.990
is now the number one priority is kid.
Yeah.
That's what I look,
Tom,

3131
03:18:20.290 --> 03:18:23.620
I'm jamming with the kids.
Right?
You clean this shit up.
Yes.

3132
03:18:24.100 --> 03:18:26.830
We'll see you with some no coffee.
Get a sprite.

3133
03:18:31.460 --> 03:18:33.510
<v 5>Yeah.
So</v>

3134
03:18:33.510 --> 03:18:35.940
<v 13>here's the deal.
I wouldn't help him bury the buy.</v>

3135
03:18:35.950 --> 03:18:38.940
I wouldn't help him get rid of the body can't because now you fuck it up.

3136
03:18:38.941 --> 03:18:42.660
Someone needs to be just locked up.
That's what that was my thinking.
Yeah.

3137
03:18:42.661 --> 03:18:46.470
Seriously.
With calling the car,
like I'm not a fan of calling the cops.
I'm sorry.

3138
03:18:46.471 --> 03:18:48.220
But I did want to be there to raise the kids

3139
03:18:48.220 --> 03:18:51.280
<v 12>because if we both get locked up,
who's going to take care of these kids?</v>

3140
03:18:51.700 --> 03:18:52.750
So that's why I was like,

3141
03:18:52.751 --> 03:18:55.030
I'm not going to help him cause then I'm going to get put away.

3142
03:18:55.720 --> 03:18:59.100
That's what I'm thinking.
I'm never even called the cops for help.
Yeah,

3143
03:18:59.101 --> 03:19:03.790
I wouldn't.
You call the cops before on Tom?
Never.
No.

3144
03:19:03.791 --> 03:19:08.740
Never.
Yeah,
that's fucked up.
Shit.
No,
never date a cop when I got out of prison.

3145
03:19:09.760 --> 03:19:12.580
Oh wait.
So how does it get your sentence?
Fuck,

3146
03:19:12.610 --> 03:19:15.740
we didn't even cause the photo.

3147
03:19:17.470 --> 03:19:19.780
You're in the wrong program.
Oh,
that's right.
That's right.
Sorry.

3148
03:19:19.781 --> 03:19:23.520
I thought something else had happened.
That's terrible.
What's it like

3149
03:19:24.840 --> 03:19:27.410
<v 13>if you've been locked up total of three years?
Yeah.</v>

3150
03:19:28.580 --> 03:19:32.720
<v 12>Be with a woman.
Oh my God.
After three hours.
Really.</v>

3151
03:19:33.980 --> 03:19:36.110
Only because like,
so check this out.

3152
03:19:36.910 --> 03:19:41.590
<v 13>Hey man,
how can I say this?
Like I'm shotgun.
Doggy.</v>

3153
03:19:42.160 --> 03:19:47.090
Shit happens.
So in prison I,
I made my context outside.

3154
03:19:47.120 --> 03:19:51.130
I said,
look,
I don't want nothing.
Everybody getting a hundred bucks I need,

3155
03:19:51.870 --> 03:19:54.240
<v 12>I'm going to throw it out there.
All right,
Russell.</v>

3156
03:19:54.241 --> 03:19:56.970
Fucking Peter's buys me a cell phone when I'm in prison

3157
03:19:59.070 --> 03:20:02.670
because he goes,
Edwards,
he asks about me.
He's like,
what's happened to George?

3158
03:20:02.671 --> 03:20:06.060
And Ed was like,
oh dude,
he's locked up Russell.
I love you brother.

3159
03:20:06.360 --> 03:20:10.800
He didn't know he was Miami,
a cell phone,
but he gave him money and Edwin goes,

3160
03:20:10.801 --> 03:20:13.980
where do you want to say I want a cell phone,
bro.
I want to talk to my kids.

3161
03:20:14.280 --> 03:20:19.110
I want to talk to my wife and I love Russell Peters.
He's awesome.
He's awesome.

3162
03:20:19.270 --> 03:20:23.370
He's been sweet to us.
That's great guys.
Yeah,
so I know I got sex.

3163
03:20:23.371 --> 03:20:27.450
Talk on the phone.
The WHO's who,

3164
03:20:27.451 --> 03:20:29.790
are you busting nuts in the first time you get out?
Like who's your,

3165
03:20:29.791 --> 03:20:33.960
is it your top?
My girlfriend.
The baby's mom.
You date a cop?

3166
03:20:34.950 --> 03:20:39.830
This is the crazy shit is nobody wants to book me no more and I get out of

3167
03:20:39.840 --> 03:20:42.270
prison.
What?
I would have booked you first.

3168
03:20:42.271 --> 03:20:44.940
I feel like this guy's got some shit to talk about now,
but they're like,

3169
03:20:46.740 --> 03:20:49.110
I didn't,
I wasn't at the store.
I wasn't nowhere I,

3170
03:20:49.160 --> 03:20:53.440
I was doing the little Latin community and Improv and like Latin shows.

3171
03:20:53.441 --> 03:20:56.080
I didn't know that much.
I only be at the store for four or five years now.

3172
03:20:56.560 --> 03:20:58.210
I was doing other shit.
So like

3173
03:21:00.110 --> 03:21:02.870
<v 13>I fucking hit up my Texas connects and I,</v>

3174
03:21:03.020 --> 03:21:07.430
and you had a member of this?
I'm on parole.
That's right.

3175
03:21:07.660 --> 03:21:10.910
It was all about that.
No one's going to,
I can't feed my family.
I've got to,

3176
03:21:10.940 --> 03:21:11.780
I got to risk it.

3177
03:21:12.020 --> 03:21:17.020
So I go to fucking Macallan Texas are you got to remember like I'm smart and not

3178
03:21:21.481 --> 03:21:23.510
saying this to be modest or Hubris.

3179
03:21:23.540 --> 03:21:25.640
I'm smart because I'm not going to get locked up.

3180
03:21:26.320 --> 03:21:29.930
So I'm fucking dressed like a square,
like fucking skinny jeans,

3181
03:21:30.300 --> 03:21:31.880
fucking old p shirt.

3182
03:21:31.881 --> 03:21:36.881
Like I looked like a square and there was this cop in the crowd and she was just

3183
03:21:37.641 --> 03:21:41.810
like,
I don't know if I wanted to arrest you or fuck you.
And I was like,

3184
03:21:41.811 --> 03:21:45.680
what the fuck?
What's going on?
I was nervous.
So,
uh,

3185
03:21:45.681 --> 03:21:50.210
I get her number and I'm there for four days and the next day after the show

3186
03:21:50.211 --> 03:21:54.890
she's like,
hey man,
you want to meet me?
And I hop on my
delicious.
Yeah.

3187
03:21:54.891 --> 03:21:57.080
I don't get offstage til one o'clock in the morning at this point.

3188
03:21:57.081 --> 03:21:59.680
You know she's a cop or no?
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.

3189
03:22:00.440 --> 03:22:03.680
But I thought she was like dispatch.
Yeah.
You know,

3190
03:22:04.670 --> 03:22:09.530
she doesn't know them up role.
She doesn't know none of that shit.
So,

3191
03:22:09.620 --> 03:22:12.810
she Latina,
he cores.
That's all there is a Macallan.

3192
03:22:14.270 --> 03:22:17.180

3193
03:22:17.181 --> 03:22:22.100

3194
03:22:22.101 --> 03:22:25.730
snitch.
Thought it was fucking weird because we had our own holiday.
Yeah.

3195
03:22:26.840 --> 03:22:29.870
That was crazy though.
We fucked for like,

3196
03:22:30.770 --> 03:22:33.410
I did four more shows out there that came back.

3197
03:22:34.160 --> 03:22:37.130
Then I dated this other cop.
She was ex,

3198
03:22:37.160 --> 03:22:40.760
she was divorced from a cop and stop being a cop.
It was fucking crazy.

3199
03:22:40.760 --> 03:22:44.960
That's funny.
It's gotta be like a fantasy fulfillment for these.
Uh,
no,

3200
03:22:44.961 --> 03:22:49.420
it's the way I'm telling you.
I'm like a cop to them.
I'm a clean cut fool.
Yeah.

3201
03:22:49.790 --> 03:22:53.480
I'm kinda direct.
I have a program I run and that's,
that's just to shut the end.

3202
03:22:53.481 --> 03:22:58.400
But I'm different.
I'm not a corn ball like that for I smoke weed.
I drink.

3203
03:22:58.401 --> 03:23:00.650

You know,
hang out with,

3204
03:23:01.730 --> 03:23:04.550
I hang out with fools that kill motherfuckers.
I fuck up the coffee.

3205
03:23:04.551 --> 03:23:08.960
You know what I'm up,

Yeah.

3206
03:23:09.470 --> 03:23:13.220
Nah,

Bang.
She was like beat up by that cop.

3207
03:23:13.250 --> 03:23:16.160
It was weird like it was really,
that was the first time I was kind of like,

3208
03:23:16.161 --> 03:23:18.860
I want to fuck this full up,
but I really can't because he's a cop.

3209
03:23:19.430 --> 03:23:20.720
I guess he would handcuff her.

3210
03:23:20.720 --> 03:23:24.260
Like he would get mad at her and handcuffed her and just leave for like what

3211
03:23:24.261 --> 03:23:29.110
hours?
Yeah.
Jesus.
She was fucked in the head.
It's not her fault.
It's,
it's,

3212
03:23:29.111 --> 03:23:33.980
it's what it was,
but like,
yeah,
he was fucked in the head too.
Fuck man,

3213
03:23:33.981 --> 03:23:36.230
that's a car.
I haven't talked about that shit in forever.

3214
03:23:37.960 --> 03:23:40.580
A question off topic,
but it's whatever you like.

3215
03:23:41.330 --> 03:23:43.160
We asked Danny Brown when he was here,

3216
03:23:43.161 --> 03:23:48.161
what his favorite snack was in jail and he would make prison burritos,

3217
03:23:48.801 --> 03:23:53.720
which was slim Jims dorito chips chopped up and then you roll them and then you

3218
03:23:53.721 --> 03:23:56.080
heat them up and the cheese would kind of melt.
Oh,

3219
03:23:56.090 --> 03:24:00.740
and a cheese stick to what was your go to a prison meal.

3220
03:24:00.770 --> 03:24:03.830
You're jam man.
That's your friend was poor.

3221
03:24:03.831 --> 03:24:08.410
If he think that access to good food.
He was in jail though.
Yeah,

3222
03:24:08.690 --> 03:24:10.250
though we dude,

3223
03:24:10.251 --> 03:24:14.480
we fucking made is one time we had dogs.

3224
03:24:14.540 --> 03:24:18.350
We got all,
everybody pitched in like 45 Dorito bags.

3225
03:24:18.620 --> 03:24:21.260
He put a little bit of water and we grinded it out.
It's always,

3226
03:24:21.410 --> 03:24:25.620
it always starts with Doritos.
We grinded a mountain.
That's the Masa.
And then we,

3227
03:24:25.780 --> 03:24:27.740
I bought all the roast beef,
we played it,

3228
03:24:27.800 --> 03:24:31.700
we put it in in a five gallon bucket with the Stinger warmed up,
boiled,

3229
03:24:32.000 --> 03:24:35.680
and then we've got all the spices marinated that she's fucking ingenious.

3230
03:24:35.820 --> 03:24:38.780
They come up with,
aw dude.
What about like white lightening?

3231
03:24:38.781 --> 03:24:42.170
Did you ever make some crazy?
We made provable wait,
layman's.

3232
03:24:42.171 --> 03:24:45.410
Too scary because there was people that went blind from Nash.

3233
03:24:45.450 --> 03:24:49.850
I know you've seen that on documentaries.
You want to fight somebody?

3234
03:24:50.880 --> 03:24:54.100
Yeah.
White Langton is no fucking around.
But we had Bruno and Bruno.

3235
03:24:54.140 --> 03:24:55.710
But when you get caught,
we're pruned.
No,

3236
03:24:55.711 --> 03:25:00.420
that's three more months they had to yourself not worth it to get fucked up.

3237
03:25:00.420 --> 03:25:01.253
Right?
Like how'd you get,

3238
03:25:01.370 --> 03:25:06.370
how'd you get the fucking gone on Pronamel shit myself because my stomach has

3239
03:25:06.371 --> 03:25:09.510
never had nothing like that.
Go through it.
I remember almost shitting myself.

3240
03:25:09.540 --> 03:25:12.630
Really?
Hell,
how do you make a Bruno you okay,

3241
03:25:13.110 --> 03:25:15.520
so I'm going to show you the real way to make,
okay.

3242
03:25:17.250 --> 03:25:21.450
Say this is a container of nuts.
You get the bottom part,

3243
03:25:21.670 --> 03:25:26.330
you cut it out and you poke little holes in it.
Like kinda like how would it,

3244
03:25:26.750 --> 03:25:29.180
not holes but like a triangle.
So it has teeth.

3245
03:25:29.570 --> 03:25:33.260
Do you know what I'm trying to get at now?
When you use a can opener.
Exactly.

3246
03:25:33.530 --> 03:25:38.530
So now you get fruit and use that to grind the fruit and you're grinding this

3247
03:25:38.531 --> 03:25:39.940
fruit in a pillowcase.

3248
03:25:41.750 --> 03:25:45.040
Alright because you want to strain it all just to be,

3249
03:25:45.220 --> 03:25:49.720
that's going to be your alcohol.
So you get all the fruit,
boom,
you squash it,

3250
03:25:49.721 --> 03:25:54.070
you get all the juice out of it.
And then you're a,

3251
03:25:55.030 --> 03:25:58.630
call it a Stinger as well.
Like the,
the center of it.
Like the,

3252
03:25:58.631 --> 03:26:01.000
all the food you have together after you squeeze it,

3253
03:26:01.270 --> 03:26:06.040
you put it back in the five gallon thing and you put sugar in it and then the

3254
03:26:06.041 --> 03:26:10.810
sugar burns it like you gotta let it,
we call it burping.

3255
03:26:11.320 --> 03:26:15.340
But what would it be?
The curriculum.
Fermentation.
Yeah we call it burping.

3256
03:26:15.400 --> 03:26:20.180
And don't forget to Burp it.
So you,
you put like a straw in it for men,

3257
03:26:20.181 --> 03:26:20.771
not the window.

3258
03:26:20.771 --> 03:26:25.771
Cause we have windows little windows and you let it cook for like four or five

3259
03:26:25.931 --> 03:26:26.650
days.

3260
03:26:26.650 --> 03:26:31.000
Six if you're a GI cause you're going to get caught with this shit.

3261
03:26:31.001 --> 03:26:33.910
Cause they always search us.
They're always on us.

3262
03:26:34.030 --> 03:26:37.390
So like say we're in prison,
you would have it one night.

3263
03:26:37.420 --> 03:26:41.200
You would have it when I would have everyone who moves in.
Yeah.

3264
03:26:41.240 --> 03:26:43.240
We're all fucking helping each other out.

3265
03:26:43.330 --> 03:26:48.330
Smart and you put it in a coffee container and sell it for 1520 bucks each dam

3266
03:26:51.160 --> 03:26:53.470
or you fucking just drink it and you're done.

3267
03:26:53.500 --> 03:26:56.840
But it's not allowed no more because you fight it.

3268
03:26:56.970 --> 03:26:59.780
It gives you courage.

3269
03:26:59.940 --> 03:27:02.120
I never even thought you had fuck that shit right now.

3270
03:27:02.190 --> 03:27:06.030
You know what that felt like we'd though,
do you have access to weed in there?

3271
03:27:06.031 --> 03:27:08.910
Everything.
Everything.
And you trade what?

3272
03:27:08.911 --> 03:27:13.410
Commissary or you put money in the guys,
whatever.
Any everything's currency.

3273
03:27:13.411 --> 03:27:15.470
Like if you want to a Homie,
I'm going to draw you a pain.

3274
03:27:15.480 --> 03:27:17.990
Let me get three landlords.
Let me get,
let me get it.
Let me get a dime piece.

3275
03:27:18.620 --> 03:27:23.440
All right.
Yeah,
I used to smoke a lot of lead in there.
Really had access.

3276
03:27:23.460 --> 03:27:27.470
But where would you go to actually light up dude,
I fuck him.

3277
03:27:27.620 --> 03:27:32.570
I got a lighter and okay,
so every locker has a lock.
You know?

3278
03:27:32.571 --> 03:27:36.350
Remember the old masters,
is that what it's called?
You know the back has a key.

3279
03:27:36.980 --> 03:27:40.070
Put the weed right there.
You light it and then we're like,
the thing goes in,

3280
03:27:40.071 --> 03:27:40.904
you suck this

3281
03:27:42.750 --> 03:27:47.750
<v 12>part or you can just get a bible cut a page rolling Bible pages.</v>

3282
03:27:49.380 --> 03:27:53.890
Apple.
Paris.
Yeah.
Now what are you making knives out of?

3283
03:27:54.250 --> 03:27:57.940
Oh Shit.
Everything brush.

3284
03:27:58.420 --> 03:28:00.910
That's too easy.
It over snap.
Really not right.

3285
03:28:00.940 --> 03:28:03.540
My favorite knife was a

3286
03:28:05.740 --> 03:28:09.190
old speed stick and then uh,
I would uh,

3287
03:28:09.400 --> 03:28:12.570
your bunk is solid rock cause it's all concrete.
Yeah.

3288
03:28:12.580 --> 03:28:15.790
And then when it gets real hot,
it may take me five hours to make it.

3289
03:28:15.850 --> 03:28:18.780
I would just write roll,
roll,
roll at the speed.

3290
03:28:18.781 --> 03:28:23.420
Stick the deodorant or the container?
The container.
I would cut it.
Yeah.

3291
03:28:23.460 --> 03:28:25.460
Just roll it to get hot.
It would get hot.

3292
03:28:25.880 --> 03:28:29.810
Finally would just be this fucking long sharp one hit or quit.

3293
03:28:31.990 --> 03:28:33.910
Even the guy from Starbucks is coming back

3294
03:28:37.690 --> 03:28:41.560
hoes.
Ain't no fucking joke.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's smart.

3295
03:28:41.561 --> 03:28:46.330
So you guys are so creative and inventive.
You're going to be,

3296
03:28:46.480 --> 03:28:49.300
it's,
it's,
it's what we are as humans.
It's survival.
It's like Tom,

3297
03:28:49.301 --> 03:28:52.180
you would make it in their dog.
Yeah,
you would.
You would make it,

3298
03:28:52.181 --> 03:28:53.240
you would fucking low carb.

3299
03:28:53.241 --> 03:28:56.450
Come back with like big ass portrait of Christina right here.

3300
03:28:57.190 --> 03:29:02.070
I'm always over here.
Your seeds on you and shit all around the shop.

3301
03:29:02.110 --> 03:29:06.430
What's up for real?
You will adapt.
Don't drink coffee no more.

3302
03:29:08.560 --> 03:29:13.020
Yeah,
you adapt.
It's fucking fascinating though,
right?
Yeah.

3303
03:29:13.021 --> 03:29:14.980
It was kind of like the,
that's the war parallel.

3304
03:29:15.280 --> 03:29:18.350
The parallel is that you adapt to uh,
uh,

3305
03:29:18.620 --> 03:29:23.380
a situation that's basically not normal.
Right?

3306
03:29:23.381 --> 03:29:26.200
Yes.
And,
but you,
you find a way to make it through that.

3307
03:29:26.860 --> 03:29:30.970
As long as you mind your own business and you're clean.

3308
03:29:32.040 --> 03:29:32.760
<v 18>Okay.</v>

3309
03:29:32.760 --> 03:29:34.920
<v 12>You're going to make it a less,</v>

3310
03:29:36.240 --> 03:29:37.770
there's just a guy in there that's,

3311
03:29:38.220 --> 03:29:40.800
most of them are up to no good with nothing else to do,

3312
03:29:40.801 --> 03:29:43.260
but to be bad cause it cause they're not going home.

3313
03:29:43.380 --> 03:29:45.540
Did you ever have that thing you,
you referenced earlier,

3314
03:29:45.541 --> 03:29:49.290
you said like sometimes you feel like,
you know,
I gotta just like,
Hey,

3315
03:29:49.291 --> 03:29:52.290
walk up to someone and be like,
Hey,
do we like,
I just want to make sure,
you know,

3316
03:29:52.291 --> 03:29:55.800
I live here with you.
We have a,
there's no problem.
Yeah.

3317
03:29:55.860 --> 03:29:57.780
Do you ever have that conversation and someone was like,
no,

3318
03:29:57.781 --> 03:30:00.510
I do have a problem with you.
Yeah,
they really?
Yeah,

3319
03:30:00.810 --> 03:30:02.670
and then then that's basically saying like,

3320
03:30:02.671 --> 03:30:04.430
so one of us is going to have to do some of that.
No.

3321
03:30:04.470 --> 03:30:08.070
After he said he had a problem,
it has react immediately.
Oh,
right then and there.

3322
03:30:08.071 --> 03:30:12.580
Yeah.
It had to go down.
So that leads to just smash.
Right.
Boy.

3323
03:30:12.990 --> 03:30:16.770
See I hate you,
but you're my people,

3324
03:30:16.800 --> 03:30:20.490
so I'm just going to kick your ass.
Hey homie,
get up tomorrow.

3325
03:30:20.491 --> 03:30:21.570
You have to get outta here.

3326
03:30:22.600 --> 03:30:23.350
<v 18>Yeah.</v>

3327
03:30:23.350 --> 03:30:24.430
<v 12>If you don't get out of here tomorrow,</v>

3328
03:30:24.431 --> 03:30:26.920
we're going to fight every fucking day until you get out of here.

3329
03:30:26.950 --> 03:30:30.850
Where's that guy going to go?
Roll it up.
It's a bitch.
Move a whole number.

3330
03:30:30.851 --> 03:30:34.300
Rolling it up.
I'm going to another cell.
Whoa.
Yeah,

3331
03:30:35.710 --> 03:30:38.780
but he talked like he basically asked for it,
right?
I mean you're saying yeah.

3332
03:30:38.800 --> 03:30:40.040
I mean it's

3333
03:30:40.370 --> 03:30:44.620
<v 13>kind of like,
or
like say you're Mexican,</v>

3334
03:30:44.750 --> 03:30:47.860
Tom and me and you're in there and oh,

3335
03:30:47.890 --> 03:30:52.620
we're not Sally's now we have a problem.
I wouldn't be like,

3336
03:30:52.621 --> 03:30:57.470
all right homie.
After lunch,
get your strap.
That means knife everything.

3337
03:30:57.490 --> 03:31:01.100
A strap is like our guns.
Get your strap,
I'll meet you in the shower,

3338
03:31:01.101 --> 03:31:02.450
homie are right.
Cool.

3339
03:31:02.540 --> 03:31:04.940
Cause we still respect each other and we would just stab each other.

3340
03:31:05.270 --> 03:31:08.930
Whoever died first.
Wow.
No,

3341
03:31:09.210 --> 03:31:12.190
<v 3>damn.
I want to do that with a couple guys here.
Were they?
Yeah,</v>

3342
03:31:14.920 --> 03:31:15.910
<v 13>yeah.
Do It on the right.</v>

3343
03:31:16.220 --> 03:31:19.810
And it's crazy too because I got called out to fight a cop.

3344
03:31:19.870 --> 03:31:24.490
I remember there's a song by Dj quick,
he goes,
you're not a killer.

3345
03:31:24.491 --> 03:31:29.491
I use a comedian and this full said that to me and I killed her home and use a

3346
03:31:29.801 --> 03:31:34.690
comedian and all like,

3347
03:31:35.230 --> 03:31:37.390

I said,

3348
03:31:37.391 --> 03:31:39.370

He goes,

3349
03:31:39.371 --> 03:31:41.470
I was just saying that to be funny.
I was like,
yeah dog,

3350
03:31:41.471 --> 03:31:45.220
but we're not at a comedy show.
Like let's go.

3351
03:31:45.280 --> 03:31:47.770
And I remember he was a,
what do you want to do?
I said,

3352
03:31:47.771 --> 03:31:50.200
I'm down a fight hummingbird.
If you want to get a strap,
I'll get my strap.

3353
03:31:50.260 --> 03:31:52.650
He's like,

Why are we'll do hands up,

3354
03:31:52.690 --> 03:31:56.200
I remembered this beating his ass,
got him up,
gave him a hug.
I said,
all right,

3355
03:31:56.201 --> 03:31:59.140
we're good now we're good.
And that's how it goes.
And that was it.
That's it.

3356
03:31:59.410 --> 03:32:03.370
That's all men do it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know,
not that women don't do it like that,

3357
03:32:03.371 --> 03:32:06.600
but like that's how we do it.
And it's,

3358
03:32:06.880 --> 03:32:11.010
and one of the guys I beat up,
we still fucking talk because of the age,

3359
03:32:11.070 --> 03:32:12.730
the Internet.
Seriously.

3360
03:32:12.731 --> 03:32:15.340
A lot of these fools are out of prison now and then they're hitting me up.

3361
03:32:15.341 --> 03:32:18.340
It's fucking crazy.

so are you allowed to have internet in prison?</v>

3363
03:32:21.430 --> 03:32:25.570
Because how are these people meaning?
Because we watched the show,

3364
03:32:25.610 --> 03:32:29.780
love after lockup and it's these people that meet their fiances on the outside

3365
