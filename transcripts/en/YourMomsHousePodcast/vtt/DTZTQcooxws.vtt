00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.800
Hi,
eight or implicit.
Okay,

2
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.130
<v 1>well go
to your mom's house.</v>

3
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.253
Christina

4
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.760
<v 0>is this guy.
I know who it is.
I got it.</v>

5
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.550
I remembered it.
That's the guy.

6
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.100
I said,
come here.
Tickle your pussy.
I got it.
Yeah.
Thank you.

7
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.210
And he ate out raven.
Simone.
That's so raven.

8
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.680
What a Dick for outing her like that,
you know.

9
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.350
Okay.
I got it.
The line.
Remember,
I don't,
I don't like it.
It's funny.

10
00:00:50.351 --> 00:00:53.070
I don't want to see it on your pussy bitch.

11
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.333
Huh?

12
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.220
That's funny.
Um,
for that.
So he,

13
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.360
it'd be a great shirt,
but he fucking told people what he did with.
Huh?

14
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.360
That's not how you,
that's not,
you shouldn't do that.
No Rolling Gentlemen.

15
00:01:13.361 --> 00:01:18.361
Never told you're not supposed to tell many squeezers in your life and you never

16
00:01:18.491 --> 00:01:21.760
tell me about these bags.
I don't tell anyone.
I don't think.

17
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.370
I don't think that's a cool,
you don't do that either.
He was not cool.

18
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.800
What happens on the road stays on the road.
It's what I'm talking about.

19
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.070
But I'm talking about all of those swinging Dixie,

20
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.820
you played around with any tech.
So many decks.
I'm,
listen,

21
00:01:33.821 --> 00:01:38.470
I'm slow.
I'm dehydrated.
You're victorious though.
I mean,

22
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.230
you,
you did it.
Yeah.
Tell you burnt came in today.

23
00:01:44.231 --> 00:01:47.110
Was it for people that don't know,
we're,
we're,
we're recording this on Monday.

24
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.860
I just did Joe Rogan's podcast with my buddy Brent Chrysler,

25
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.480
and we've had this way in this weight loss challenge and today was the way in

26
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.400
and the first of two.
Yeah.

27
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.290
At first it was gonna be a three day way and we just scratched.

28
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.880
That's crazy talk.
So we did two day weigh in.

29
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.530
So we both came in today and he was like,
you know,

30
00:02:08.531 --> 00:02:11.500
I ran like 20 miles yesterday and I did this today.
You know,

31
00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:16.420
he's just being burned like pulsive and crazy.
Right.
And Jane the last,
yeah,
yeah.

32
00:02:16.421 --> 00:02:20.920
Which is exactly how I predicted he would do because we've been thinking about

33
00:02:20.921 --> 00:02:24.750
this as,
and as the weeks have come to a close and yeah,
we were like,
there's,

34
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.630
he's probably Burt's not known for it.
The slow and steady approach.

35
00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:33.230
I played the long game.
He's more of a like,
let's,
let's crunch time,
right?
Yeah.

36
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.960
Let's cram for the exam now.
It's time to do it.
Yeah.

37
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.720
But he looked great for bird look great.
You look amazing.

38
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.110
Wow.
So when he got there,
I was like,
do you think you why?
He's like,

39
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.000
I really think he was weighed myself today because I didn't want to freak myself

40
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:52.870
out or beat.
So he got there and I was like,
what do you think it is?
He's like,

41
00:02:52.871 --> 00:02:56.020
I think it's at the weight,
the weight.
We were trying to go for it to 27.
Right.

42
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.950
So he goes,
I think I'm up to 27 and I go,

43
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.370
<v 2>all right.
I looked at him and I was like,
I could see two 25 so I was like,</v>

44
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:04.750
I think he looks to 25 no.

45
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:09.751
Explain why to 27 cause that's not just an article right now to 27 was the Bmi

46
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.460
to get you out of obesity in into just overweight.

47
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.170
Yes.
Um,

48
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.280
and we looked it up and 27 that was based on being six one I'm about a half an

49
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.190
inch shorter than Bert.
Technically we would then have different BMI is,

50
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:29.880
but we both just agreed to do two 27 that was,

51
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.630
now if one of us had stayed over to 27,

52
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.500
that person's still in obesity.
They'd lose the cause.

53
00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:40.060
The whole thing was to try to get out of obesity.

54
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.490
Ari is now part of this and he's,
he was like,
instead of getting the call,

55
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:48.760
he got the call instead of being congratulating,
he was like,
wait a minute,

56
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:49.240
wait a minute.

57
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.100
I started to like backpedal about basically not wanting to pay for

58
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.300
<v 3>Ching on tender hooks.</v>

59
00:03:57.301 --> 00:04:01.800
Here I was in the studio watching you guys on Joe rogan.live.
Yeah.

60
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.790
And I mean,
I heard him,
he,
he picked up,
he's in some other country.

61
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.620
<v 2>Yeah,
I don't worry.
And he's like,
oh,
I want to see the scale.
And I was like,</v>

62
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.180
back to our height.
We're both well under.
And he was like,

63
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:20.680
so what I need.
And then he told me,
he was like,
he's like,
you're on the cusp.

64
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.420
You need to not gain any weight.
He told me that today.
Um,
so what,

65
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.720
what happened was Burt weighed in first he was two 21.
I was like gosh,

66
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.030
which is really impressive.
I'm really impressed.

67
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.510
And I knew when I woke up today when I got on the scales first thing and I took

68
00:04:36.731 --> 00:04:40.420
a leak and I got on the skills,
I was two 21 so I was like,
all right,

69
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.610
I know I can,
I can,
cause I went,
I was sweating a little bit,
you know,

70
00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:48.430
doing stuff this morning.
So yeah,

71
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.910
I suspected I would be around two 20 and I ended up being two 19.

72
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.860
Wow.
I was just two pounds,

73
00:04:56.861 --> 00:05:00.980
which is not much but enough to hopefully,
yeah.

74
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.230
So now the thing is,

75
00:05:02.231 --> 00:05:04.720
and by the time this comes out it'll be over this whole thing.

76
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:09.460
This is like the big election.
Yeah.
This is it man.
This is scary.
The nail biter.

77
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.490
So we are now within a 24 hour window of the way and where we both want to win,

78
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.730
we both need to come in

79
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.900
at or lower than to like basically this is what has to happen.

80
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.970
If we weighed the same tomorrow,
it's over.
I win if I weigh less tomorrow anyway,

81
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.850
I win.
Wow.
If he weighs less,

82
00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:33.640
he has to be more than two pounds less

83
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.970
than me.

84
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.950
<v 3>So he has to out underway.
You buy two and a half pounds to win tomorrow.</v>

85
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.090
Right.
So your lead theoretically.
Yeah.
So you have to hold that lead.

86
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.460
<v 2>Yeah.
Wow.</v>

87
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.700
<v 3>I have full confidence in you.
I,
we know this is teams to girl all the way.</v>

88
00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:56.170
Last night I shaved your back for you.
Um,
a lot of people on Instagram,

89
00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.920
they were crediting my back shaving for the weight loss for the weight loss

90
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:03.770
because that's at least five or 10 ounces.

91
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:07.400
If you look at the amount of hair in the shower.
Sure.
Um,

92
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.430
do you have a strategy for today?
I think the listeners are wanting to know.

93
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.030
<v 2>This is my strategy will be,
you know,
uh,
in like I said,</v>

94
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:17.660
it'll will be after the fact later.
Sure.
We'll know what happened tomorrow.
But,

95
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.680
um,
you know,
I,
I talked to some people and um,

96
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.680
it seems to be the best strategy is to eat some very small,
uh,

97
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.930
meals.
You don't want to completely starve yourself.

98
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.680
<v 3>Okay.
And would those meals consist of pizza or chicken wings?</v>

99
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.400
<v 2>It is a,
mostly,
it's actually a chocolate and sausage diet is what it is.
Okay.</v>

100
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:44.170
Um,
so just a little piece.
So it,
you just have small portions,
uh,

101
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.470
something fatty.
Like I've been having an avocado,
um,
little piece of chicken,

102
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.830
little bit of spinach just to like kind of keeps something in your system.

103
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.640
I'm going to be active,
I'm going to do,
um,
but just cardio.

104
00:06:55.641 --> 00:07:00.260
I'm just some cardio work,
um,
sweat,
you know,
and then I'll do,

105
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.010
I'll do a hot bath tonight.
Get a little more sweat going.

106
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.230
No more fluids down with fluids.

107
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.750
The toughest part is the last couple hours.
Hopefully I'll be,
you know,

108
00:07:11.751 --> 00:07:14.900
I know I'll be fatigued.
I'll be tired tonight.
So you just want to be asleep,

109
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.360
fall asleep.
It's hard,
you know,
getting up in the morning and you want,

110
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:25.040
you so much.
Want to consume anything,
anything.
Yeah.
So that'll be the hard part.

111
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:27.590
And then I'll try to get another sweat going,

112
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.730
especially the hour leading up to the way in.
Wow.

113
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:36.080
So I'll know like when we're done here,
I'm going to go work out,

114
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.600
I'm going to,
you know,
figure out my weight,
I'll figure out how much of that,

115
00:07:39.601 --> 00:07:42.320
and I'll kind of have an idea how much is water weight and I'll know how much I

116
00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:43.154
need to sweat.

117
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:48.130
<v 3>I'm really in awe of you.
I mean,
I have to say your discipline,</v>

118
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.270
your,
uh,

119
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.620
your dedication to the game has really been an inspiration to me.

120
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.910
I don't think I've,
I haven't seen you this laser focused and you know,

121
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:02.170
you're focused about your work,
obviously.
I wouldn't say never,
but I mean,

122
00:08:02.171 --> 00:08:06.220
you've lost so much weight since August,
before this bet by the way.

123
00:08:06.221 --> 00:08:09.790
Like this is something that's been in the works with you for a long time and

124
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:14.350
like a switch flipped.
And I think you've just been like,

125
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.150
you just been really good genes.
I think we're all proud of you.
Thanks.
Jeans.

126
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.870
I think it's been just like,
you know,
it's the same switch

127
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:24.640
<v 2>flip the first time I lost weight,
which was about 16,
17 years ago.
Yeah.</v>

128
00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.730
Um,
there's sometimes you just go like,
oh,
I just want to do this.

129
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:32.710
I don't like being,
you know,
this big and,
you know,

130
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.980
you just go,
I'm going to,
I'm just going to do something about it.
You

131
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.930
<v 3>know,
it's,
and it's 2017 I'm sure like so many people's new year's resolutions,</v>

132
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:42.290
it's to lose weight.
And ever since I've been doing Paul [inaudible],
he's now,

133
00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:45.770
I do it twice a week.
I've just not long,
it's only been what,

134
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.000
a couple of months that I've been doing this and it really changes.

135
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.240
It changed me already.
Like,
you know,
I feel stronger.
Yeah.

136
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.280
But also like the discipline of just fucking

137
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.640
<v 2>doing it.
You know what?
Fuck my brain.
Fuck what my mind's telling me.</v>

138
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.190
I just do it and I don't think about it.
And it's so,
it's so gray,
man.

139
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.340
Not so great.
I have the same,
you know,
by the way,
a lot of people have asked,

140
00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:12.900
so I'll just tell them what I did.
Um,
you know,
I got onto a oh,
diet.

141
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.280
The reason I did that is that,
um,
I actually,
I didn't even know.

142
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:20.550
It's funny that he's my buddy.
I didn't know that,
that Joe had been doing that.

143
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.820
Yeah,
apparently he talks about it.
I had no idea on Instagram.

144
00:09:23.821 --> 00:09:28.670
He's always posting and veggies,
no carb right away.

145
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.170
I actually found out about it from Mike Kennedy,

146
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.310
a different comedian and he sent me a link to it.

147
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:36.721
And when I was reading it,

148
00:09:36.721 --> 00:09:39.990
I had read about other diets before and you know how people,

149
00:09:39.991 --> 00:09:44.550
obviously you try things and it seemed like I go,
okay,

150
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:49.110
this seems pretty doable.
And then I actually saw that,
um,
some athletes,

151
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.780
we're proponents of it,
you know,
some,
some like high perform,

152
00:09:52.781 --> 00:09:57.330
like a triathlon people.
And I was like,
oh,
so these are people that you know,

153
00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.550
that no nutrition.
Yeah.
And then I saw that,
you know,
some of them hadn't.

154
00:10:01.551 --> 00:10:05.220
Their cholesterol goes down and you get to indulge in like,

155
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:10.110
I like to indulge as an eater.
You know,
all the good stuff in Quito,

156
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.310
you give up sweetness but you still get to adult yet you know,
sugar.

157
00:10:14.311 --> 00:10:16.660
But you get to indulge in fats.
So,

158
00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:21.230
so you feel fuller actually feel fuller.
And if you're somebody that is like a,

159
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.960
you know,
a Foodie,
you go,
well that's a whole world of deliciousness still,

160
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:30.030
you know.
So for me it was like I get the satisfaction of eating that fatty food.

161
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:35.530
It's not like nothing but fat butt,
but it does,
it is,
you know,

162
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:39.570
a higher fat diet and you know,
you can read all about it and you know,

163
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:43.320
some people are probably not into it some,
but whatever.
I liked it.

164
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.290
You learn things the whole time.
The big thing,

165
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.950
if you want to make some change to get started,

166
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.990
I would say just cut your sugar once you reduce your sugar,
you know,
it's,
it's,

167
00:10:54.991 --> 00:10:59.490
it's a game.
Checks your body burns that sugar off before it will get to the fat.

168
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.670
The reason,
I mean,
there's a lot of other reasons,
but,

169
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.500
but if you're eating a ton of sugar and then that's what your body's going to

170
00:11:04.501 --> 00:11:08.370
burn first.
Yeah.
And you're,
you know,
you get glucose spikes,

171
00:11:08.371 --> 00:11:12.150
you get your body just stores fat.
It's,
um,
he's,

172
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:16.830
you start gaining weight.
And what Burt said today on on Rogan show,

173
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:21.960
he's like,
you just can't fucking eat.
And I agree are a big proponent of that.

174
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.740
Just stop fucking eating because the truth is even if you're doing this Kido and

175
00:11:25.741 --> 00:11:29.110
but you're eating a five pound steak.
Yeah,
you can't do that hammer,
you know,

176
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.180
doing all the veggies.

177
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:35.040
If you're caloric intake is still one thing you're going to be fucking fat
still.

178
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.890
You learn,
you know is um,

179
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.920
portions matter and also Keto teaches you to reduce your protein intake.

180
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.620
A lot of people think that you can just eat as much protein as you want,

181
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:51.440
but excess protein causes that glucose spike to them.
And so,
you know,

182
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.370
I was somebody that eat enormous

183
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:56.590
<v 3>portions are big now.</v>

184
00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.640
So basically it's a little bit of protein with some fat to keep you going and

185
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:05.290
then you get your carbs from vegetables,
veggies.
Yeah.
Great.
No,
no sugar,

186
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.310
no pastries doable.
If I'm telling you I've been doing it,
no fat milk,

187
00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:13.870
if you're going to have actually a little bit of found out I was doing really

188
00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:18.190
heavy.
Creamer is best,
like have you,
and then you dilute that a little bit.
But,

189
00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.320
um,
whole milk has sugar in it.
Oh,
right,
right,
right.
I mean,
I was using a splash,

190
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:27.670
but still the thing is you're learn,
you learn as you with anything.
You're like,

191
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.460
oh,
I was doing that part wrong.
And then you just make your change.

192
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:34.720
Most importantly,
how have your dump spin on this new diet?
I better.
Much better.

193
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.580
Yeah.
I mean like I'm eating less food and eating a more,

194
00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:44.620
you know,
clean way and I've had very healthy dumps.
That's wonderful.

195
00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:48.790
Because they were very explosive.
Yeah.
And we were,
we were troubled.

196
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:53.560
Now you gave up sugar,
which for you was,

197
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.581
I mean,
you're the,

198
00:12:54.581 --> 00:12:58.900
you were the guy who we passed by a shop and if there was a chocolate croissant

199
00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.880
insight,
it was in your gullet quick.
Yeah.

200
00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:05.530
And that you loved pastries.
That's true.
A lot of them.

201
00:13:05.531 --> 00:13:09.760
So how did you tell me about that process?
I mean,
that,
you know,

202
00:13:09.761 --> 00:13:13.440
the hardest part was the first 72 hours.
Um,
yeah.

203
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:17.500
I was telling him today that we went to that podcast and you're like,

204
00:13:17.501 --> 00:13:22.120
just don't cause I was snapping at people.
You were out of here with sugar?

205
00:13:22.121 --> 00:13:24.100
With crane.
Yeah.
I know.
I didn't know what was going on.

206
00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:28.660
I mean before I made the decision,
just that like doing it.
So I think it was,

207
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.130
it was more about the choice.
I was like,

208
00:13:30.131 --> 00:13:32.980
I'm just doing this and then just going for it.

209
00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:36.580
It came to the point now that like I don't,
I don't go,
Oh man,

210
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.420
I wish I could have that chocolate croissant and just go like that's not for me.

211
00:13:40.421 --> 00:13:42.790
Cause I think he realized too,
at least what I've,

212
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.450
because I've lost a few pounds to start out with.
Polite but otherwise diary,

213
00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:49.760
proud of your job.
You're a polite,
you've been dedicated.
Yeah.

214
00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:51.880
I've never seen you dedicated to fitness.
Never.

215
00:13:51.881 --> 00:13:54.850
Cause I hate it and I still hate it.
It's not that I enjoy exercising,

216
00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.590
it's that I have to,
because I'm 40 years old and this is it for me.

217
00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.410
Like I can't do the second half of my life out of shape.

218
00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.290
I refuse to hate myself because I don't like my body.

219
00:14:05.291 --> 00:14:09.460
I haven't liked my body since I was 17 years old and I'm sick and tired of it.

220
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.410
All right.
Thank you.
Um,
both the fuck.

221
00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.450
I don't even know what the fuck I was gonna say.
I Dunno.
The Oh,
the Diet stuff.

222
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.170
Yeah.
Oh,

223
00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:21.760
there is a point where you start to go is the chocolate croissant is the joy,

224
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:26.790
the momentary joy of the chocolate croissant going to make me happier in the

225
00:14:27.911 --> 00:14:28.450
long run.

226
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:31.600
Meaning tomorrow when I step on the scale and I know I fucked myself out of

227
00:14:31.601 --> 00:14:35.440
today's diet,
is that,
is that going to it long term?

228
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:38.910
Is this really gonna work out for you?
Start to think,
think like that.

229
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:43.810
You also go,
what?
What are you doing?
If you've had some results?
Yeah.

230
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.030
Then you go,
do I want to fuck these what I've been doing,

231
00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:50.200
I want to go backwards and gain it and then try to go.
I know,
cause you don't,

232
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.910
you don't and it's not worth the temporary.
Yeah.

233
00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.180
You ever heard that saying Kate Moss?
She goes,

234
00:14:56.181 --> 00:14:59.630
nothing tastes as good as skinny.
Feels it's true and I've,

235
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.820
I've always remembered that when I'm around like,
should I,
oh,

236
00:15:01.821 --> 00:15:04.790
I want to cheat the galleys pastries lying around this,

237
00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.960
this Christmas I maintained,
I didn't lose,
I just stayed the same weight,

238
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.040
which is like a fucking miracle with all the shit we had lying around.

239
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:18.170
But I would always think Kate Moss,
nothing tastes as good as skinny feels right.

240
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.440
It feels good.
Yeah.
You should be proud.
You know,

241
00:15:21.441 --> 00:15:24.440
you look better so much better and you're looking in the mirror and you're like,

242
00:15:24.441 --> 00:15:26.060
this is way better.

243
00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.810
You don't have to flog yourself anymore for being a fat fuck.

244
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.290
You don't have to hate yourself every time you go shopping.
Right.

245
00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:37.040
I heard you guys talking about that today on the show to where Burt was like,
oh,

246
00:15:37.041 --> 00:15:40.200
you don't have a size 40 at the gap or wherever.
Like,

247
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:44.510
and that's not that big really.
I mean,
no one would really be able to tell.

248
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.460
I'm a bit of a Fashionista.

249
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:51.170
I like clothes and it's a bummer to me.
It's a bummer to me.

250
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.280
Like when I'm,
um,
when you go into a store,

251
00:15:55.610 --> 00:16:00.200
like I just know,
see a cool shirt doesn't fit,
doesn't fit.

252
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:03.460
I know you have another size,
bigger size.
We have,

253
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.360
it's the worst.
When I first had Ellis,
I was,

254
00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.060
I weighed in at two oh eight when we,

255
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:14.870
when we went to the hospital to deliver hand.
We're fully pregnant though.
No,

256
00:16:14.871 --> 00:16:19.400
but I'm saying as a woman,
I've never weighed 200 and I know,
yes,

257
00:16:19.401 --> 00:16:23.030
I know that's baby.
Yes,
that's fluid somewhat.
But it's a lot of that is fat.

258
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.540
How much do you,
do you weigh?
Do you know what you weigh right afterwards?

259
00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:28.460
Like when you leave the hospital?

260
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:33.080
I would say half of that was actual what baby water with hormonal,

261
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.200
they don't weigh on the way out.
So you don't know.

262
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:40.190
But I know when I got home I was a size 12 and that's the biggest I've ever

263
00:16:40.191 --> 00:16:42.800
known.
What was the next time you weighed yourself?
I didn't,

264
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:47.030
I didn't look at the scale for months until we moved out of Redondo because I

265
00:16:47.031 --> 00:16:51.230
just knew that to start on that journey would really,
you know,

266
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.170
you gotta be ready to start losing weight before you do that after a baby.

267
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.810
You shouldn't be flogging yourself over your weight after you have a kid.

268
00:16:56.811 --> 00:17:01.811
But I remember being really big for the first time in my life and really not

269
00:17:02.001 --> 00:17:05.300
liking how that felt terrible.

270
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:10.070
All the shit looks terrible on me.
Everything looks bad.
It sucks,
man.

271
00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:11.653
Terrible.

272
00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:15.910
But you know what I did though is I would buy nice clothes at,

273
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:19.370
at the appropriate size.
So then you go,
okay,
I'm going to surrender to this.

274
00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:24.110
By the way,
I did that.
You know,
I,
um,
I bought a lot of Nice clothes.

275
00:17:24.111 --> 00:17:27.300
That's enormous.
Right?
You know,
just because I was like,
dude,

276
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:31.730
I'm not gonna not have clothes and you're not going to flog yourself every day

277
00:17:31.731 --> 00:17:34.690
when you're in the process of,
of getting in shape or losing weight.

278
00:17:34.691 --> 00:17:39.320
Like if that's not worth it either to be like,
fuck,
fuck me,
I'm so ugly.

279
00:17:39.321 --> 00:17:42.590
I'm just going to wear the same thing.
Like,
no,
dude.
You know what I do?

280
00:17:42.591 --> 00:17:46.250
I bought new clothes.
I know you're a smaller size now.

281
00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.730
I'm about to have to get the,
uh,
the next size down for the past.

282
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:55.530
So exciting genes.
Congratulations.
Yeah,
it's good.
Um,
you know,

283
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.530
I definitely,
like I said today,
I'm not trying to be dramatic about it.

284
00:17:58.531 --> 00:18:01.620
I think I just want to live more like this,
you know,

285
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:06.720
like I don't have a really goal number.
It's not really about the number,

286
00:18:06.721 --> 00:18:10.420
isn't it?
No,
it's not really what looks you get married to the number,
but no,

287
00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.590
I just go,
like right now I go,
I could lose another,
you know,

288
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:15.240
I don't think it's a big deal.
Well,

289
00:18:15.241 --> 00:18:20.010
the number's good because then you can be like,
I got to weigh myself to see how,

290
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:22.150
because you don't know how fat you're getting.
Yeah.

291
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:26.070
Unless you have that number number yet.
Fucking,
but I'm saying like,
I go,

292
00:18:26.071 --> 00:18:28.950
I look at the number and I'm like,
all right,
like,
and I see where I'm at,

293
00:18:28.951 --> 00:18:33.270
I see how I feel.
And I go,
well,
you know,
if I lost another,
yeah.

294
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:38.550
You know,
I don't think losing another 15 is a big deal now for boys.

295
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.850
I feel like men,
you guys,
all you have to do is stop drinking soda.
I know.

296
00:18:41.851 --> 00:18:45.810
Like I lost 20 pounds.
Oh,
women.
Our body holds on to fat.
Yeah.

297
00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:50.540
Because we need it for like getting periods.
Yeah.
Making babies.
The baby baby.

298
00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:55.440
They want our body.
We're mammals.
Shit.
Oh,
I hooked the old board up,

299
00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.290

308
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:30.310
All the heads.
Yeah,
I'm proud.
Uh,

309
00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:35.320
now I'm stoked to come out of the [inaudible] crazy man.

310
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:40.160
So this is kind of big.
I'm going to fluid bond with Jesse.

311
00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.490
Yes,

Oh,

Happy.
It's bad.

312
00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:47.110
I'm going to fluid bonded with Jessica.
Jessica,

313
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:52.550
I'm on the blue and bond boy.
So today Burke,

314
00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.430
I'm Rogan was like,
yeah,
I don't know if you noticed,

315
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.310
but when Tom and Kristin near the,
they're like the biggest assholes everywhere.

316
00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:02.040
I know.
I felt bad.
I was like,
you got home.
And I'm like,
oh my God,

317
00:20:02.041 --> 00:20:05.010
I hope I wasn't too mean to Bert.
I mean I w you know,

318
00:20:05.011 --> 00:20:08.820
we're just talking shit and I do.
God bless Sam.
I do is really be serious.

319
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.100
And yeah,
I know.
Hurt him and love him.

320
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:14.490
So of course everyone loves Burt and I texted them both Burnley on.

321
00:20:14.491 --> 00:20:16.740
They haven't responded yet,
so no,
you hurt their feelings.

322
00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.450
<v 4>That's what the,
I had the bubble NAM case.</v>

323
00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:26.160
I went inside the land of the man wants to go inside.
If he can win.

324
00:20:26.161 --> 00:20:29.070
Couldn't do it man.
But I did.
I said I could do it and I can

325
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.260
imagine that as the glitz man.

326
00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:39.640
<v 3>Oh,
he's tacking,
he might be mentally ill a little.
I had a window.</v>

327
00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:44.470
I don't know.
That was kind of manic,
wasn't it?
I'm on the fence.
Yeah.

328
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.010
It seems a little manic to me a little bit.
It's like this

329
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.860
<v 0>don't drugs.
Yeah.
Flip it comes on your legs this way.
Yeah.</v>

330
00:20:53.861 --> 00:20:55.860
Go and they

331
00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:06.500
really
poor raven.
It's let's just like you like,

332
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:11.030
yeah.
You like I said Hey.
Yeah.

333
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.640
What does he do for a living?
I think he does music now.
He was an actor.
Maybe.

334
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:20.550
I don't know that.
It's so tacky to share.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You shouldn't share.
No.

335
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:26.770
Okay.
You're lucky she lets you eat her pussy.
You dumb.
Fuck.
Yeah.
Right?

336
00:21:26.771 --> 00:21:31.570
Yeah.
You don't talk.
Don't brag about that shit.
God Damn,
that's not cool.
Tacky.

337
00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.220
<v 2>There is.
Um,
whereas this cheat sheet,</v>

338
00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.850
there's this thing I've been wanting to show you.
I didn't realize this was the,

339
00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.760
it's so fucking great.
So,
you know,

340
00:21:40.761 --> 00:21:44.180
we've been talking about my dad and then other people.

341
00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:48.320
Do Dad accents foreigners?
Yes.
So,

342
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:52.010
and basically what we're talking about is like when my dad is around,

343
00:21:52.011 --> 00:21:56.120
my mother talks normal,
but when her family comes from Peru,

344
00:21:56.630 --> 00:22:00.080
he adopts a English,

345
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:04.640
but he has a little bit of a Spanish accent and people have written in with

346
00:22:04.641 --> 00:22:09.050
stories about it.
Absolutely is my favorite thing.
So like you know,

347
00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.770
someone wrote in that their dad works or go,

348
00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:14.570
they go to an Asian restaurant and he starts talking to the waitress.

349
00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:19.620
I'm in English but like it with an Asian downtime and some berries.

350
00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.340
It's so embarrassing.
So apparently this is what this is here.
Okay.

351
00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:27.370
Joey Barton is an Irish soccer player who played a season for a French team and

352
00:22:28.521 --> 00:22:33.521
he developed the Dad Accent Syndrome during a press conference and then the

353
00:22:34.011 --> 00:22:37.070
sports talk show back at home,
can't wait to ask him about it.

354
00:22:37.071 --> 00:22:41.060
So they recognized that he was doing that.
Um,

355
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.690
and this is just fucking amazing.

356
00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:49.480
Yes.
You mentioned that last there.

357
00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.600
How's your French got any better?
Yeah,
a little bit.
Lvst without,

358
00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:54.563
you've got to policy.

359
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:57.703
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

360
00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:00.890
<v 2>So they're setting them up and that's how he talks,
obviously.
Right.</v>

361
00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:05.580
Because you can hear his,
um,
his,
his notable Irish accent.
Yes.

362
00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:10.550
And then this is him doing a press conference with the French Press.

363
00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:14.860
<v 0>Lindsay Lohan.</v>

364
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:20.610
<v 2>Well,
in France,
uh,
speak about this.
It's,
it's,
it's normal in England and,</v>

365
00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:21.840
um,

366
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:26.840
maybe it takes me one or two game to adapt or it's not a problem.

367
00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:31.610
The one criticism of the French league is it's,
it's a little bit,
uh,

368
00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:36.570
you know,
they,
and I can understand,
you know,

369
00:23:36.571 --> 00:23:41.490
I watch a Neil yesterday,
they have 10 men and they're happy to lose one nil.
Uh,

370
00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:46.580
you know,
they,
they have 10 men and for me you might as well,
five nil is one nil.

371
00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:53.380
<v 0>That's how he taught,
right?
Yeah.
And he's like,
yeah,</v>

372
00:23:53.381 --> 00:23:54.690
he sounds like a Gallagher brother.

373
00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:58.530
<v 2>Perfect.
[inaudible] you could get you a job on a lower low.</v>

374
00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.150
Gotcha.
Okay.

375
00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.670
<v 0>What's her Louella happened?</v>

376
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:05.430
<v 2>Oh,
no.</v>

377
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:08.220
Clearly what you're trying to do is you're trying to speak in a pattern that the

378
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:10.430
the European,
the front of Janis Lansdowne,
I get that.

379
00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:15.370
But we will make some stairs.
Yeah.
I'm embarrassed.
Embarrassed.
I oversee and man,

380
00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.760
I'm doing a conference.
So it's full of French journalists.
No,

381
00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.490
no foreign journalists really in the room and off seat.

382
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:24.030
And I can not blow for him.
And a really good parliament.
Taxi was sitting in the,

383
00:24:24.031 --> 00:24:27.250
in the bar and I'm talking away and I'd said before the went there,

384
00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:30.160
cause I remember Steve McClaren's famous one nice to rib Steve about was

385
00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:31.003
anything like it.

386
00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.360
So I was talking about not doing that when it went out in my mind not to do it.

387
00:24:36.361 --> 00:24:40.320
So anyway,
I'm doing this conference and I see two ads in the bucket

388
00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:48.680
and it just dawned on me that my worst nightmare mostly doing this ridiculous

389
00:24:49.621 --> 00:24:50.830
Fran Jackson.
I've done that.
Yeah.

390
00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:55.480
<v 0>Thing where I've thought about something I don't like in my act.
Yeah,
no,</v>

391
00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.680
don't do that.
And then I'll do it immediately.
Do it.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

392
00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.190
<v 2>So then I'll stop like playing on it to try and get,
I mean,</v>

393
00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.530
both of them would in floods of tears and end the often to Warhol at the

394
00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.760
conference have gone and the French were just stone syslog and bow hunting.

395
00:25:08.761 --> 00:25:12.790
He did not have any idea what was going on.
Even afterwards when it broke,

396
00:25:12.791 --> 00:25:14.740
it went viral and everyone was actually giving me a,

397
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:19.110
a bit of a Mickey taken rightly so.
Um,
the French wine,

398
00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:20.643
what

399
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:28.680
we understood you needed to speak slowly and I was like,

400
00:25:28.681 --> 00:25:32.110
yeah,
Wayne,
just dad.

401
00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:37.070
<v 0>It is yourself when you make yourself look bigger.
Big Idiot like that.
It's also,</v>

402
00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:41.300
he's a good,
it's good.
It's good in a sense of humor.
She really is cool as shit,

403
00:25:41.301 --> 00:25:44.060
by the way.
I really liked the student.
Yeah,
but why don't you fucking suck?

404
00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:47.810
Oh God,
I wish I could suck it.
Uh,
what's her name?

405
00:25:47.811 --> 00:25:50.080
Did that Lindsay Lohan?
Yes.
She remember,

406
00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:53.550
that's the first instance that we saw where she was like,
and uh,

407
00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:57.090
it's a wonderful thing and this country is like,
what

408
00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.680
<v 2>my dad goes,
uh,
uh,
uh,</v>

409
00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.900
we teach you a,

410
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:06.590
you enjoy yourself today is nice.
No.

411
00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:11.180
All the people there and then was like,
ah,
yes.
It deal.
Tony's very nice.

412
00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:16.120
Is that the people doing the yes.
Uh,
uh,
uh,
and I,
we,

413
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.660
we go many times we've met Betty

414
00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:23.010
<v 0>joy.
They actually,
I think he's right.
This guy that like,</v>

415
00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:26.190
they think you're just kind of slowing it down.
Yeah.

416
00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.400
They don't realize what you're doing either.
Yeah.
No,

417
00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:33.510
I think my dad does that to Spanish speakers too.
He does.
Yeah.

418
00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:37.120
A little bit.
I'd love to do a road trip with your dad.

419
00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:42.790
Go for it to see how he manages things,
you know.
Yup.
Yup.
Yup.
You can him.

420
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:46.200
Um,
I love how European dudes sit with their legs crossed.

421
00:26:46.201 --> 00:26:50.060
I forgot that I cross him sometimes.
My Dad does too.
I feel like,
no,
you don't.

422
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:53.860
Not like that guy had it.
No,
I usually do the,
the the big fold.
Yeah.

423
00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:57.060
But there's sometimes you're just like,
I dunno,
just depends on,

424
00:26:57.061 --> 00:27:01.360
it's like the seating dictates it.
I had a full lady lady cross.
Yeah.

425
00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:04.900
Europeans do that.
They're smaller.
Right?
We're so fat.
Right.

426
00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:09.720
Americans are too fat to do the The lady cross you can't do late across big old

427
00:27:09.721 --> 00:27:10.554
fat fucks

428
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:15.930
come to America.
And the,

429
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:23.610
yes.
Yes.
And uh,
so when did you have a good time?

430
00:27:23.611 --> 00:27:25.000
When I'm least at the thing today.

431
00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:33.430
We had such a good time with them.
I miss them.
That was fun,
man.

432
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:37.060
I talked to top talk today.
He's on the weight loss.
Kicked to AC.

433
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:41.430
Now you guys had a little thing going.
We have a bet,
right?
Yeah.

434
00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:45.180
Well what is it?
He has to get down to a certain way.
He weighs less than me.

435
00:27:45.181 --> 00:27:49.620
He's just for reference.
But um,
he does.
Oh yeah.
See,

436
00:27:49.621 --> 00:27:52.050
it's so funny.
I don't,
I can't tell,

437
00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:56.040
I mean right now he might be a little more than me,

438
00:27:56.041 --> 00:28:00.690
but his baseline weight is way less than my baseline.
Interesting.

439
00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.580
So,
um,
anyways,
if,
uh,

440
00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.190
if he gets to the goal weight,

441
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:12.580
I have to go with him on a fucking cruise,
a four day cruise,

442
00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.870
worst I hate Cruz is way worse.

443
00:28:15.871 --> 00:28:18.690
Or is it the cruise or the four dayness of it.

444
00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:23.160
God dammit now and on one hand a four day cruise,
you're in,
you're out.

445
00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.590
I don't want,
I fucking hate cruises,

446
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:30.240
but I also want them to get through a full choir.
So anyways,
if I win,

447
00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:32.070
if you don't,
we're not when,
but if he doesn't,

448
00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.750
we have to do a trip that I want to do.

449
00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.080
So I just tried to make it something that he doesn't want to do.
Vietnam

450
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.660
couldn't do that to him.
He wouldn't even take that seriously.
I said Brazil,

451
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:48.510
which I would love to go,
I'm dying to go to,
but he said he was like,
he's like,

452
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:53.220
I don't want to go to Brazil.
And I was like,
exactly.
It's hot.

453
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.380
It's muggy.
Actually,
if he does it,
who is spicy,
I think I'll just let them,

454
00:28:58.410 --> 00:28:59.460
I'll let them go somewhere else.

455
00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:04.080
But like I tell him that he hears the beauty of your father is that no matter

456
00:29:04.081 --> 00:29:05.190
where you take him,

457
00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:09.750
all he's going to want to do is sit in the hotel room and watch Turner classic

458
00:29:09.751 --> 00:29:13.320
movies.
That's all he wants to do.
So why even make him travel?

459
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:15.060
Doesn't matter where you go.

460
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:20.190
The only place he wants to go abroad is England has never been.

461
00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.750
And I think even then he would be like,
oh,
this is going to see this thing.

462
00:29:24.751 --> 00:29:29.220
And we'd go see fucking big Ben or something and then gonna go back to the room

463
00:29:29.221 --> 00:29:34.060
buddy.
And He'd be like,
oh,
I mean we just got out here.
So I

464
00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:40.410
do want to go,
you know,
whatever Buckingham.
Yeah,

465
00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:44.050
it big.
This is big.
Ready again when I get something to eat.

466
00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:50.610
<v 3>The thing is,
I think he thinks England is just America with funny accents.</v>

467
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.060
They might,
I think he does.
I don't think he understands that it's Europe.

468
00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:58.610
It's not that the doorways are narrower,
everything's small.

469
00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.940
<v 0>He's reached such an incredible level of repeating himself.</v>

470
00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:07.690
Like he was telling me that his brother lost a bunch of weight.

471
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:12.560
Right.
Which one?
Steve [inaudible] the one that's alive rock by and then the,
um,

472
00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:16.600
the one that's alive.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I thought he had more than no too,

473
00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.390
for some reason though.
So,
okay.
He goes,

474
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:23.870
I'm Steve lost a bunch of weight.
I go,
that's great man.
We'll see.

475
00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:28.220
Wasn't ever that big.
And I go,
how'd you do that?
And he's like,
you know,

476
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:32.960
anything is,
he did it the old fashioned way,
you know,
count calories and uh,

477
00:30:32.961 --> 00:30:35.950
you know,
just kinda did it like that.
And I go,
Yup.

478
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:38.330
Since he told me that story,

479
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:43.870
he has told me that story 10 more times and every time he says it,

480
00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:46.940
I know you already told me this.
I know.
I just,
I like to repeat myself.

481
00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:50.900
He just does that.
He learned,
he owns that.
He just likes to repeat himself.

482
00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:56.330
Same thing with the retirement on the horizon because,
and I can retire.

483
00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:59.750
It's a,
you know,
just holding mentality,

484
00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:05.600
getting ready for a retirement and uh,
you know,
we all the whole different thing,

485
00:31:05.601 --> 00:31:08.880
you know,
it's just the next chapter.
I'm like,
Yup,

486
00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:13.010
I indulge it the first couple times like oh yeah,

487
00:31:13.011 --> 00:31:17.030
and the next 25 times I talked to him,
you know,

488
00:31:17.031 --> 00:31:20.570
retirement and we had a mentality like that.

489
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:23.090
I know you've already fucking said this.

490
00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:27.930
<v 3>It's so funny.
Yeah.
You know,
it's cute.
He goes,
I got my calorie counting book.</v>

491
00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.490
It tells you how many calories,
which is funny cause there's like,

492
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:36.060
there's a calorie counting book on this thing called the road back to you.

493
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.670
Who Was it?
No,
it's a calendar reminder.

494
00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:43.080
<v 0>Oh,
I'm thirsty.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.</v>

495
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:46.770
Can you drink a little or no,
I'm just going to,
there's a sip.

496
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:49.530
I'm just going to cut.

497
00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:53.430
<v 3>Are you being serious?
Yeah.
You're not gonna drink it all on his whole tomorrow.</v>

498
00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:58.040
<v 0>Yeah.
Not until 1130.
I is that safe?
Probably not.</v>

499
00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:02.690
Because you drank a little.
Please write on the way out of here.
Oh,
right.
Yeah.

500
00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.780
Just have a sip of my water.
Seriously.
You want it right now?
Okay.

501
00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.850
You want to have an orange?
Oh God.

502
00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:15.210
Oh yeah.
Um,

503
00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:19.610
so a bunch of people have sent in a mommy and jeans.

504
00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:24.040
<v 3>So excited about this movement.
I really am.
I think of all the things we've done,</v>

505
00:32:24.041 --> 00:32:27.490
this is definitely one of my favorites.
Yeah.
Let me see.
Is this,

506
00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:31.540
do you want to play what we've been working on?
Sure.
How that's influenced?

507
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:36.090
<v 0>Uh,
America really,
when you think about it,
let me see.
Yeah,
this is,
uh,</v>

508
00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.170
this is you here.
Oh,
you want to start with mine?
Okay.

509
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:45.890
<v 4>No thanks.
I'm just glassing.
All right.
What can I get credit for you,
mommy?</v>

510
00:32:45.891 --> 00:32:49.090
I'd like a double tall ice,
uh,

511
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:54.110
soy latte and a bottle of water.
That's it.

512
00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.930
Thank you.
Thanks jeans.

513
00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:03.310
<v 0>That's great.
No,
I also ordered a bottle of water.
I don't think you do that,</v>

514
00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:06.320
but just checking.
Oh my God.
So I don't know.

515
00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:10.880
I don't know if you noticed,
but I incorporated Jess glass

516
00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:16.120
is another level.
I think we should start adding more and more.

517
00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:21.180
I think also it should be how you negate any suggestion or there was no you

518
00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:25.230
like,
oh,
can I get you something to eat?
Just glasses.
Glasses.
Yeah.

519
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:29.850
What can I get you right,
right.
Uh,
I think we always have to go there.

520
00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.920
Would you like to try the number two?
Right,
so special and you go up.
No,

521
00:33:32.921 --> 00:33:36.100
I'm just glassing no,
now and I think there should be,

522
00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:40.540
if you can add more your mom's house sayings,
the better the order.
Yeah.
So let's,

523
00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:44.110
let's stop this game up a notch.
Well,
here's what I did.

524
00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:46.930
I get something certainly paid here.

525
00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:50.220
<v 5>This is a different night.
So I had already ordered,</v>

526
00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:55.980
I call them jeans again.
Took a while for him to,

527
00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.670
I posted the front half of this on Instagram.
Yeah.

528
00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:07.880
Nice guy.
Always.
Yeah,
they did.

529
00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:13.560
They do their thing and stuff like that.
They're good
man.
This is this.

530
00:34:13.561 --> 00:34:15.990
As long as it's taken to get,
I know,
but whatever,

531
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:18.900
it's a drive through the drive through.
You're not even getting out of your car.

532
00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.600
Got Him on in there.

533
00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:28.403
I love you

534
00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:32.920
<v 0>man.
You got an I love you.
So now the game is,
is elevated.</v>

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:32.020
Maybe we don't have it queued up already or is it recorded themselves?

560
00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:33.790

People walk in,
they can't see that he's doing it.

576
00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:56.720
They don't know what the hell he's saying.

577
00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:07.580
It's so good.
Not even once.
At least on camera.

578
00:38:07.581 --> 00:38:10.640
Have we heard anybody be like,

No.
Um,

Yeah.
Obviously listener.
I don't know.</v>

602
00:39:53.921 --> 00:39:56.350
I start with my love for denim.

603
00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:01.340
<v 7>I know,
you know,
I think about denim from the past.</v>

604
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:06.320
<v 3>From the past.
Yeah.
Yeah.

606
00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.410
<v 7>You know,
and then I think about like two of the designers back then.</v>

607
00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:13.680
Now we're making durable denim,
you know,

608
00:40:13.681 --> 00:40:15.450
for those guys to the minors.

613
00:40:30.731 --> 00:40:34.690

614
00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:40.090
fabric or something like that.
Yeah.

So we're going to a special waffle place.
We looked it up.
Yup.

622
00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:07.710

Yeah.
I used to go there as a kid and it changed owners.
Anyway,

623
00:41:07.711 --> 00:41:10.260
Governor Jerry Brown just signed the bill.
Naming Denim,

624
00:41:10.261 --> 00:41:12.690

627
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:21.020

628
00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:23.200
the company first pass at posited,

There you go.
That's true.
There's the factory in a man friend disco.

631
00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:33.970
Wow.
Well,

632
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:39.010
the fabric of Denim is widely believed to have been invented in many hundreds of

633
00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:40.310
years ago.

634
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:44.370
<v 0>Yeah,
there you go.
Yeah.
All right.
Thank you,</v>

635
00:41:44.371 --> 00:41:48.280

00:44:49.261 --> 00:44:51.900

Oh,

684
00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:55.860
who's doing this?
Well,
I was in Orlando.

685
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:03.420
<v 9>Boy wouldn't be talking about</v>

686
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:07.240
what a piece of shit you are

687
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:11.390
<v 0>and this guy is an incredible piece of shit.</v>

688
00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:13.940
God is activations.

689
00:45:13.941 --> 00:45:18.941
You know we've talked about this before and that is that every guy finds a lane

690
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:19.910
to get laid.

691
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:24.910
Absolutely magical imperative that you think are not out to get laid.

692
00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:31.970
Yeah.
Are just deceiving you.
Yeah.
In how and what their lane is.

693
00:45:31.971 --> 00:45:35.230
That's their racket.
They're like,
I'm,
the guy doesn't want to get laid.

694
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:39.890
And that's how I get like this fucking scumbag.
I mean,

695
00:45:39.891 --> 00:45:44.420
describes this guy.
He is a,
it looks like he's of Indian descent.

696
00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:48.650
What kind?
I don't know.
Let's just say from that world.
Um,

697
00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:52.940
he's got the gold arm band.
He's shirtless,
he's got gold arm bands,

698
00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:57.440
a big gold chain.
Looks like my mother would wear that necklace.

699
00:45:57.441 --> 00:46:01.910
I know where the F that's from.
Fricking H and.
M Dude.
He ain't no real Indian.

700
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:04.460
Well you have that necklace.
That's what I said.
My mother would wear it.

701
00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:09.650
It's a five 99.
I just meant that it's a pos from H.
And.

702
00:46:09.651 --> 00:46:12.170
M I have the same lines as a ridiculous belt on.

703
00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:18.950
He's got a,
he's got a a line painted on his head,
so he's like,
no,
no,

704
00:46:18.951 --> 00:46:23.660
this is uh,
you know,
I'm,
I'm,
this is my ancient teachings.

705
00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:27.320
Hindu Visha sure.
This,

706
00:46:27.321 --> 00:46:31.490
my grandfather taught me this and this means that my chairs are from,
I come,

707
00:46:31.491 --> 00:46:35.750
doesn't dry quickly.
I think this line on my forehead doesn't dry quickly.
Yeah.

708
00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:40.210
It's all like nonsense.
So he's made this video about threesomes.

709
00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:43.130
At least two women are lying on the floor.
He's standing,

710
00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.310
he's squatted over the middle of their hands,

711
00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:49.850
looks like their hands are on his junk and they're lying.
They're like,
oh,

712
00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:55.010
teach.
Teach us as well.
You know,
like they need to be schooled.
Yeah.

713
00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:58.130
The twin goddess activations.
Yeah,
please.

714
00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:11.740
<v 9>Your hands are on their toes,</v>

715
00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:19.200
<v 0>so he has one hand on either in the middle of the tits.</v>

716
00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:23.400
Both girls.
Right.
It's activation for the twin goddess.
Yeah.

717
00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:28.440
<v 9>Warming up the entire body.
Anyway,</v>

718
00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:30.940
the titles,

719
00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:33.870
<v 3>it's just like the gays.
Yeah.</v>

720
00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.033
<v 9>Yay.</v>

721
00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:45.860
Massaging the tips.
He's rubbing their tests now.

722
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:52.840
<v 3>Bullshit.
Oh,
hey,
grace her titties.
So yeah,
he's great course.
Of course.</v>

723
00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:57.120
Only when the whole body is warmed up.
Do you connect with the Yani Yoni,

724
00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.410
<v 9>and I'm able to</v>

725
00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:10.060
such a
ball center course.

726
00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:15.500
<v 3>This motherfucker's not even like from India.
You know what I mean?</v>

727
00:48:15.501 --> 00:48:20.210
Like maybe his great,
great grandparents came over when this camera goes off.

728
00:48:20.211 --> 00:48:23.510
He's like,
look,
I'm just trying to fuck.
Yeah,
that's exactly what happens.

729
00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:28.830
<v 9>Fuck
your h and m necklace.</v>

730
00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:35.280
Now he's on the Yummy.
Oh,

731
00:48:35.281 --> 00:48:37.640
shut up.
The Nickelodeon

732
00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:41.933
grabbed their pussies.

733
00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:45.630
<v 3>Here's the other thing that's crazy about this.</v>

734
00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:48.420
This under the guise of I'm teaching,

735
00:48:48.421 --> 00:48:53.280
I'm making an instructor gets you all these fields.
In other words,
they're like,

736
00:48:53.281 --> 00:48:55.500
we're helping,
right?
So like,
yeah,
I'm just,

737
00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:59.900
I'm doing the trying to teach right now.
Another thing,
you know,

738
00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:04.740
I don't know why there's this assumption that all female sexuality is identical.

739
00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:09.540
Like,
you know,
women,
you guys are all about your feelings for,
and like,

740
00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:17.330
I know a lot of women who are hardcore horse thugs bitches who don't give a fuck

741
00:49:17.941 --> 00:49:21.090
about feelings.
I know girls who fuck harder than dudes that,

742
00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:24.310
you know what I'm saying?
Like their numbers are crazier than,
dude,

743
00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:28.810
this is bullshit.
Like,
come on now.
Really?
You're trying to tell me this guy,

744
00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:32.550
he got to rub around her.
You know how aggravating that is to a woman,
by the way,

745
00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:37.500
when a,
when a fucking dude rubs around your pussy like,
no dude,
get in there bro.

746
00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:39.510
Listen to you.
I speak for a fucking,

747
00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:44.330
you know how many days like this I'm banging his hands as opposed to hand.

748
00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:48.610
It's frustrating when guys do all this.
Oh,
I have to be extra special because no,

749
00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:51.450
you don't just fucking touch it.
Bitch

750
00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:57.080
<v 9>tells me,
Oh no,</v>

751
00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:02.780
I'm at the gate of your temple.

752
00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:13.730
<v 3>No Shit.
Dummy.
Yeah.
Okay.
Then what?
You'll love this part,</v>

753
00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:17.043
<v 9>they have</v>

754
00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.660
to squeeze the Pec muscles.
Oh God.

755
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.470
Have you actually being invited in?

756
00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.113
<v 3>Okay.</v>

757
00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:33.550
<v 9>And as all of you will have some food,</v>

758
00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:38.050
the certain areas of potential at the cheese ball,
peaceful,

759
00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:42.890
the casebook
presence,

760
00:50:42.891 --> 00:50:47.891
loving and one person's a painting at Hillcrest south reading yet and then the,

761
00:50:48.391 --> 00:50:52.870
the emotions accelerate and it is quite a beautiful,

762
00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:55.540
amazing activation.

763
00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:59.720
<v 3>Oh my God,
no activation was the word of the day on sesame street.</v>

764
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:04.430
That's what this reminded me of when he said Shit activator

765
00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:11.000
activator,
this guy.
And I got to tell you that to his credit,

766
00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:14.930
if he didn't have on his h and m necklace and his ridiculous belt,

767
00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:20.180
he's just some fucking mediocre looking guy with a button on his head who would

768
00:51:20.181 --> 00:51:23.510
never be able to get the twin goddess activation.
So you know what?

769
00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:26.450
He's figured shit out on him.

770
00:51:26.451 --> 00:51:30.500
I just feel like definitely a book,
you know,
Bullshit.

771
00:51:30.501 --> 00:51:34.970
Did God bless as they say,
sign off the good.
Good job,
sir.

772
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:39.010
What kind of check is,
I'm drawn to the the button guy would.

773
00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:44.180
Yeah.
And that too,
because I liked her goddess,
all that stuff.

774
00:51:44.181 --> 00:51:48.410
You know me like I like,
I like spiritual.
No,
and that's a thing,

775
00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:51.090
but my bullshit radar goes,
no.

776
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:55.010
Now my bullshit detector knows that this guy's full of it.
No,
I know.
I know.

777
00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:57.800
It's not real.
Ladies.
Listen,

778
00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:03.860
couple of chicks shoot him down like that and then a couple are like this and

779
00:52:03.861 --> 00:52:05.630
then all of a sudden,
I bet you if you ask them,

780
00:52:05.631 --> 00:52:10.610
how many threesomes have you had is he's like,
I don't know,
500 he what he does,

781
00:52:10.611 --> 00:52:12.000
he goes,
he's self help groups.

782
00:52:12.001 --> 00:52:15.680
He goes to meeting groups and like energy goes after people seeking it,

783
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:19.250
which is smart.
Yeah.
He's like,
oh his lane,
he's a predator.
He's like a Hyena.

784
00:52:19.251 --> 00:52:23.390
He waits for the prey to be hurt and then he swoops in and it's under a jack all

785
00:52:23.391 --> 00:52:28.180
veil of,
I'm not hunting,
you know,
but that's how he hunts different.
Brilliant.

786
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:29.023
This guy is,

787
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:34.090
<v 9>I just hit stop.
Put your hand back on my day.</v>

788
00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:37.283
There you go.

789
00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:42.950
<v 3>Consent,
consent guys.
Fucking scumbag.
Big piece of shit.</v>

790
00:52:42.951 --> 00:52:45.980
That guy is asked him,
will you ever date her mom?

791
00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:53.150
I asked him,
I asked him K in that.
I still love that one.
So much.
So do I.

792
00:52:53.151 --> 00:52:55.400
And I don't feel like it got the traction it deserved.

793
00:52:55.830 --> 00:52:59.020
And I think people didn't want to get into that one as much as we did.
No,
I know.

794
00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:05.180
Awesome.
Would you ever marry your mom was like,
Oh really?

795
00:53:05.181 --> 00:53:09.290
Would I really?
Well I had another thought about that.
Boy,

796
00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:10.700
he calls me mom.
You know what I mean?

797
00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:19.580
Yeah.
This fucking guy.
That's a thing that girls don't realize.
Oh,

798
00:53:19.581 --> 00:53:24.320
I was going to say that.
Uh Oh.
You know what it is.
I think women,

799
00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:28.920
a lot of the time they make a mistake with dudes is cause they want dudes to act

800
00:53:28.921 --> 00:53:32.300
like women.
You know what I'm saying?
So they think like this fucking asshole,

801
00:53:32.350 --> 00:53:35.760
this pony tail and his h and m necklace like,
oh,
he's sensitive.

802
00:53:35.761 --> 00:53:39.150
He's like a check,
right?
He's got a penis.
Like no bro.
Oh,

803
00:53:39.151 --> 00:53:42.780
thank you for bring that.
Like that's why you got to go for like a dude.

804
00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:45.930
Because if fucking dude is straight forward,
you know what I'm saying?

805
00:53:45.931 --> 00:53:50.400
Like you want to do that.
Let you know what he wants.
Well that too.
And look,

806
00:53:50.401 --> 00:53:54.930
you're never going to find a girlfriend in your boyfriend.
Stop fucking making.

807
00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:57.120
Stop trying to make your boy,
your husband.

808
00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:59.390
Your girlfriend is never going to fucking happen.

809
00:53:59.391 --> 00:54:02.370
And that's why you have girlfriends.
Right.
And You keep the husband out of it.

810
00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:03.640
He let him be a dude.
Right.

811
00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:06.370
Otherwise you get stuck with that fucking bullshitter.
Yeah.

812
00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:09.090
And he's finger banging every other girl in the neighborhood,

813
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:14.460
twin goddess activating.
It's all love.
That's all.
I'm just,
I'm spreading my Yoni.

814
00:54:14.461 --> 00:54:16.230
Yeah,
it looks really good.

815
00:54:16.231 --> 00:54:20.640
I was going to say that last week response,

816
00:54:20.641 --> 00:54:25.500
a lot of people are into it.
People encouraging you to give it a shot.
Yeah.

817
00:54:25.501 --> 00:54:27.600
I received a lot of artwork.
Photoshop.

818
00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:33.280
Any thoughts on whether or not there's a chance that this could be on a special

819
00:54:34.321 --> 00:54:38.810
artwork?
Right?
Maybe I'm not,
I'm not ruling it out.

820
00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:43.650
Would you marry your mom?
All right.
What's the title of the special though?
Well,

821
00:54:43.651 --> 00:54:47.070
I saw him when somebody made one that was like all caution tape and well that

822
00:54:47.071 --> 00:54:49.470
goes without saying.
I'm going to have my fire,

823
00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:54.260
my flame tee shirt and then caution tape maybe over my mouth.
No,
I know.

824
00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:58.410
You don't know what's going to happen.
Yeah.
Wow.
But what is this,

825
00:54:58.470 --> 00:55:01.430
what is the title of this hour though?
Um,

826
00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:07.170
no bangs allowed.
That was pretty good.
Or no hair?
No fear

827
00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:13.470
about.
I'm halfway there.
Halfway there.
Oh,
I like that one.

828
00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:17.640
But I want it to signify danger.
Oh.
You know,
like

829
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:23.220
trouble.
Like you know,
like,
oh,
you know what's another good one too?

830
00:55:23.221 --> 00:55:27.510
When the microphone is like a gun or something like Dang,
you know,

831
00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:31.870
tough.
Oh No.
Or maybe and maybe the,

832
00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:36.870
that one,
the funny stuff happens the shoulders and you go,
I don't punish.

833
00:55:36.871 --> 00:55:39.670
It just happens.
Yeah.
That's kind of an interesting one too.

834
00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:43.950
About like cease fire,
cease fire.
These,

835
00:55:43.951 --> 00:55:48.600
my jokes are the bomb.
Something like that.
It was cool.

836
00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:50.370
Well thanks for bringing this back.

837
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:54.503
<v 8>Good.</v>

838
00:55:57.610 --> 00:56:02.480
<v 3>So you like it.
Oh,
I love it.
It's a really cool way that you flattering photo.</v>

839
00:56:02.810 --> 00:56:06.280
Well,
you know what I would have liked in the Photoshop though.

840
00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:09.970
Now I guess he did it right because it's not,
it wouldn't be a gradual fade.
Yeah,

841
00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:12.800
it would just be that harsh.
The Benjamin Franklin.

842
00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:17.330
That's Avastin does look good though.
Yeah.
No,
no,

843
00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:18.253
no doubt.

844
00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:23.030
Do you think that guy would twain goddess activate me if I had that haircut?

845
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.070
Nope.
He wouldn't

846
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:27.850
<v 0>even lay me that guy.
It'd be like,
you need to grow that hair back.
Yeah.</v>

847
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:31.690
That guy on camera.
Absolutely.
Layer off camera.

848
00:56:31.691 --> 00:56:35.440
He'd be like a peg.
No.
He'd be like,
something's wrong with John.

849
00:56:35.441 --> 00:56:37.830
Soccer's would do me.
Yes.
If you told him you were Vegan,

850
00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:41.940
you would definitely do it.
My vegan vagina.
What?

851
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:45.580
By marrying your mom.
This lady came back.
Uh,

852
00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:47.650
you know about this lady?

853
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:50.190
<v 10>Yeah.</v>

854
00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:00.050
The jingle bells.

855
00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:28.660
<v 0>What is happening?
Oh,
I've got to Fart.</v>

856
00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:37.480
I heard it.
Did it.
Did it register.

857
00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:42.410
<v 3>It's going to happen.
We've been missing so many parts.</v>

858
00:57:42.690 --> 00:57:46.440
<v 0>You got really upset about that.
Guess what?
We have a gift for you</v>

859
00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:48.960
and the dog

860
00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:55.230
heard you and your request for a Tom gets mad.
Okay.

861
00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:57.550
<v 3>Montana.
He built one.</v>

862
00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:05.800
It might be right,
but I don't think so.
God dammit.

863
00:58:07.210 --> 00:58:08.210
You know it's fun now

864
00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:12.760
when the myriad of technology fails.

865
00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:20.360
<v 5>Hold on a second.
Okay,
hold on.
I'm sweating.
Getting mad.</v>

866
00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:23.300
Good.
Trying to see where the hell is this.

867
00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.113
<v 3>That's good</v>

868
00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:36.210
<v 5>fucking thing.
What's wrong baby?
Let's talk about</v>

869
00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:46.740
what's that?
There you go.
There's that again.

870
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:49.950
Pop back in again and I'm really going to lose my mind.

871
00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:52.230
You talk about these constantly.

872
00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:58.790
I was in the airport.
Obviously it's subjective,
but I think it,
you know

873
00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:02.420
to like,
why did that happen right there?

874
00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:07.740
Why did that just depends on what if you're talking about

875
00:59:12.850 --> 00:59:14.130
<v 3>great job.</v>

876
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:18.940
<v 0>There you go.
Very exciting.
Yeah,
very exciting.
You could do it.</v>

877
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.650
We could probably build one of 'em over of just,
God dammit.

878
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:26.520
I was thinking of that.
Yeah.

879
00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:30.490
That's usually my go to upset expression.
God dammit.

880
00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:34.550
Let's keep archiving these.
Thank you blue band.

881
00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:38.390
Let's keep a thorough record of every time he freaks out because I feel like we

882
00:59:38.391 --> 00:59:41.060
haven't even more anger ones and that.
Yeah,
there's,

883
00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:45.350
there's more time.
A wonderful start.
Thank you.

884
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:46.550
Really good work.

885
00:59:50.130 --> 00:59:53.930
Just glass.
And how are we doing on those shirts?
Are they still around?

886
00:59:53.931 --> 00:59:56.950
What's the deal?
I set up the thing.
Yes.

887
00:59:57.050 --> 00:59:59.870
So I'm so glad you just reminded me a bad glass.

888
00:59:59.871 --> 01:00:04.871
And is the email that glass and@gmail.com if you go and you send an email to bad

889
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:09.820
glassine and there's no g and glassine,
right,

890
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:16.340
bad glass.
and@gmail.com,
uh,
I set up the email address,

891
01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:21.020
you send your um,
proof of purchase,

892
01:00:21.021 --> 01:00:26.021
like your email receipt from your purchase of the just glass and shirt.

893
01:00:27.050 --> 01:00:30.620
And if you got one of the first batch,
which were Gildan,

894
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:35.570
I'll send you a little something that's very nice cause I didn't know that they

895
01:00:35.571 --> 01:00:37.400
were going to be like that.
So I'm sorry.

896
01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:40.460
Well sometimes when you're just glass and you learn things,
yeah.

897
01:00:40.461 --> 01:00:43.310
If you got the second wave,
you know you've got the right shirt.

898
01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:46.600
So he got the glass,
you can see your tag.
Is this a Gildan?

899
01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:51.860
Are you upset about it?
You can email me just glass and at g mail

900
01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.950
items.
I want it to bring up,
yeah,
please go ahead.

901
01:00:57.350 --> 01:01:01.130
That wonderful clip we had last week of the super,

902
01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:05.030
uh,
that guy cleaning out that toilet.

903
01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:10.550
Remember the guy with one tooth and he was cleaning out that vile toilet with

904
01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:13.900
all this shit with no gloves.
Oh my God,
I remember that.
Yeah,

905
01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:17.990
so we started watching that.
Yeah,
it's called the super,

906
01:01:17.991 --> 01:01:21.080
and it's called that because it's super depressing that shows,

907
01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:24.500
it's a fucking bummer,
man,
but really entertaining,
really entertaining.

908
01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.870
It's about these poor people who live in,
basically,

909
01:01:26.871 --> 01:01:29.410
it's basically about a slumlord.
Well,
you know,

910
01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:33.410
they're slumps and not slums.
They're pretty bad there.

911
01:01:33.411 --> 01:01:36.590
They all got bed bugs and well,
that's because of the people in it.

912
01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:41.120
I disgusting animals.
And the one that we saw were horrific.
Lord.

913
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:44.600
These poor people in a lot of them have,
you know,

914
01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:48.880
alcohol and drug abuse stuff happening too.
I watched another episode,

915
01:01:48.881 --> 01:01:52.100
remember that the woman that was living on a piece of Shit,
God,

916
01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:55.670
and he wouldn't show up for the court date and he was out drinking and like,

917
01:01:55.671 --> 01:02:00.560
what are you doing?
Get your life together.
When he got racist,
did he?

918
01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:04.010
Oh yeah,
to the Asian Lady.
You like,
now you're kind,

919
01:02:04.011 --> 01:02:07.320
you're good for an Asian or whatever.
Yeah.
Or then he was like,
oh,

920
01:02:07.321 --> 01:02:11.320
that's the white guy.
I mean,
everything was raised to that counts.
Right?

921
01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:14.450
Yeah.
It was super funny guy.

922
01:02:14.790 --> 01:02:18.900
We actually know the guy that cocreated though show.
Oh,
that's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.

923
01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:20.100
That's so funny.
Yeah.

924
01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:24.820
<v 3>Um,
we gotta text her about that.
Yeah,
let me wash them.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Uh,</v>

925
01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:27.690
so we watched that.
That was cool.
And then,
oh,

926
01:02:27.691 --> 01:02:32.210
we went to go feed the ducks yesterday with our son.
Yeah.

927
01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:34.463
Shit.

928
01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:39.500
Now I grew up going to this duck pond and back in the day in the 80s,

929
01:02:39.871 --> 01:02:44.190
you could just bring your loaf of bread and throw it at the ducks and it's like

930
01:02:44.191 --> 01:02:45.240
the best day ever.

931
01:02:45.241 --> 01:02:50.190
So we took our little boy there yesterday and I brought a loaf of leftover

932
01:02:50.191 --> 01:02:53.710
German Rye bread,
a loaf,
because I had,
I'm not eating that shit.
Yeah.

933
01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:56.910
My Dad ate a couple of pieces when he was here and,
um,

934
01:02:57.570 --> 01:03:02.460
we go to the ducks and it was so fun.
I mean,
we've had them,

935
01:03:02.461 --> 01:03:03.430
we threw 'em,

936
01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:07.500
he's the bread up in the air and then the birds would fly by and snatch it out

937
01:03:07.501 --> 01:03:12.150
of the air.
Oh,
was red.
They went crazy.
And then joggers were running like,

938
01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:16.110
excuse me,
walking by kind of Shitty.
And we're there with our boy.

939
01:03:16.111 --> 01:03:17.010
He's just like watching.

940
01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:22.610
And then we get to the other side of that lake on and it says do not feed the

941
01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:24.174
birds.

942
01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:30.120
Lecia I felt like such a pos and it's like,

943
01:03:30.121 --> 01:03:31.860
it messes with the ecosystem.

944
01:03:31.861 --> 01:03:34.440
The birds won't migrate this and that and followed your lead.

945
01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:38.580
Well a man back in the 80s,
you could throw a fucking hot dogs.
The birds,

946
01:03:38.581 --> 01:03:43.300
nobody would stop Ya.
Yeah.
He loves his car.
And there was no,
um,

947
01:03:43.350 --> 01:03:44.700
there were no signs right there.

948
01:03:44.701 --> 01:03:49.020
There's one sign around the entire two mile radius of that thing.
I know.

949
01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:53.730
Fuck.
I felt like such an ass.
Well we didn't do it after that.
No,
my God,
no,

950
01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:57.030
but no one did.
We were getting so many dirty looks we got.
Um,

951
01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:59.340
I could not figure out why everyone hated us.

952
01:03:59.341 --> 01:04:04.140
So much follow up video on somebody we featured a few weeks ago.
Oh,
no kidding.

953
01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.033
Yeah.
What's that?

954
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:08.440
<v 12>Do you mind already?
So can you sent a lot?</v>

955
01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:13.330
You do when you taste stuff a day.
I like that.
Ice Cream garbage.

956
01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:18.070
It doesn't smell good centers acting as a passive sense for you.

957
01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:20.050
Most of the time is a human being.

958
01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:24.670
As a pup you're going to be using it as an active sense.

959
01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:30.370
Activating those memories.
Act Associating again with your pop activities.

960
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:31.910
Street,

961
01:04:32.350 --> 01:04:37.120
one width of your masters growing and you are beginning to snap into pup mode.

962
01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:39.670
<v 3>Boy.
Wow.
Because this was the pop guy.</v>

963
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:43.450
We actually got bombarded with hatred for,

964
01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:47.350
I think initially saying this guy was British New Zealand.
I know,

965
01:04:47.351 --> 01:04:51.000
but that was a big fuck up and then I got yelled at and then we set Australian.

966
01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:52.330
Oh No.
Corrected again.

967
01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:56.950
The Kiwi's get very upset if you don't identify their accents and you being the

968
01:04:56.951 --> 01:05:00.010
master.
Well I actually knew I was just,
you know,

969
01:05:00.490 --> 01:05:04.600
I was seeing where can we do a perfect Kiwi accent?
Please go ahead.
Sure.
Hold on.

970
01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:07.320
<v 12>Underwear.
Are you a new best friend pub?</v>

971
01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:12.180
Your owner is going to make your pair of underwear.
Oh my God.

972
01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:17.080
He's going to make sure that he leaves a bit of his center of his us going to

973
01:05:17.081 --> 01:05:21.760
throw up
some smoothies piece at differently.

974
01:05:21.761 --> 01:05:22.750
A few loads of calm.

975
01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:26.250
<v 0>Wow.
Wow.
This got way better.</v>

976
01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:32.360
Could you repeat that in his accent?
Um,
underwear.

977
01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:36.340
Are you a new best friend?
Underwear.
They're your new best friend.

978
01:05:37.550 --> 01:05:39.750
I hear [inaudible] morning men,
Manchester.

979
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:43.700
<v 12>Go ahead.
Your owner is going to make you a pair of underwear.</v>

980
01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:47.890
<v 0>Your honor is going to make you a new pair of underwear go and what's going to</v>

981
01:05:47.891 --> 01:05:48.820
be allowed?
Underwear.

982
01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:55.150
<v 12>He's going to do a make sure that he leaves a bit of his center.
His ass,</v>

983
01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:59.900
his ass.
That's good.
Some smell of his piece and smell.

984
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:01.780
Definitely a few loads of calm.

985
01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:06.210
<v 0>Definitely a few loads.
Remember how the other video,
oddly enough,</v>

986
01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:11.100
that featured the pups.
They made it totally nonsexual.
Yeah,
that's the lie.
Right?

987
01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:14.760
And we were like,
this is such a sexual young that they're,
they're minimizing.

988
01:06:14.790 --> 01:06:16.380
Yeah.
Then you get them alone.
He's like,

989
01:06:16.381 --> 01:06:19.950
I'm going to come all over this and you're going to smell it.
What a liar face.

990
01:06:20.130 --> 01:06:21.480
I guess for the documentary,

991
01:06:21.481 --> 01:06:24.240
they didn't want them to seem like total fetish derelicts,

992
01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:28.410
but these guys are in their,
it's a community.
It's just,
it's freeing.

993
01:06:28.411 --> 01:06:29.250
It's liberating.

994
01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:32.160
They're coming all over each other and then he texts like dog outcome.

995
01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:36.780
I'm going to come in my underwear and you're going to smell it.
It's such a big,

996
01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:39.660
this is just called pup play.
Very normal.
Yeah.

997
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:42.840
<v 12>Going to take a good,
strong smell of your own,</v>

998
01:06:42.841 --> 01:06:46.620
his underwear when you feel like it when you're pleasuring yourself.

999
01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:52.450
<v 0>I mean,
this guy is like a photo power dog.
He's a,</v>

1000
01:06:52.590 --> 01:06:54.120
he's an aggressive top.
Yeah.

1001
01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:55.630
<v 12>Importantly though,</v>

1002
01:06:56.910 --> 01:07:00.430
is activities that you're going to be doing to help build up your set.

1003
01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:05.620
The first one in first collar training,
missy is to know your own smell.

1004
01:07:05.850 --> 01:07:08.140
Oh,
you know your smell when you wake up in the morning,

1005
01:07:11.410 --> 01:07:14.230
take a good with of your pit.
Yeah.
Before you've showered,

1006
01:07:14.350 --> 01:07:17.260
before you've put any deodorant,
Cologne.
Yeah.

1007
01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:20.570
<v 0>No,
thanks.
So He's training us.
Yeah,
I got it.</v>

1008
01:07:21.050 --> 01:07:26.030
<v 12>Speaking of Dod collide and so it's time to change them.</v>

1009
01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:29.210
Reduce your use of soap as much as you can.

1010
01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:33.440
Build what's necessary to keep yourself clean and sanitary as you like,

1011
01:07:33.770 --> 01:07:37.250
but get rid of perfumes,
soap as much as you can,

1012
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.650
and drop deodorant down out of your use as much as possible.

1013
01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:45.540
<v 0>There you go.
Nice and steak.
Lg sent.
Yeah.</v>

1014
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:49.300
<v 12>When you've got time during your work day or during those moments when you're in</v>

1015
01:07:49.301 --> 01:07:54.250
class,
you want to go here?

1016
01:07:55.110 --> 01:07:59.770
No.
Shoot your hand down your pants.
Grab your nuts.

1017
01:08:00.790 --> 01:08:03.400
Have a feel.
Get your fingers over them

1018
01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.150
and bring them up.

1019
01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:18.680
<v 3>Yeah.
Was that just a show open?
Are those the Instagram teaser?</v>

1020
01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:24.740
Did A,
Oh my God,
he's right.
I liked that.
He wears a tee shirt and leather pants.

1021
01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:28.370
Wolf.
The pup owner.
Trainer.

1022
01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:34.490
Yeah.
I want to watch that again.
I feel like my brain wasn't ready for that.

1023
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:36.860
Oh yeah.
Sweet.

1024
01:08:37.730 --> 01:08:41.760
<v 12>What'd you put time during those moments when you're in class,</v>

1025
01:08:41.970 --> 01:08:46.320
when you've got a minute,
you want to go here?

1026
01:08:46.830 --> 01:08:50.220
Oh my lives.
Unlace your pants.

1027
01:08:50.370 --> 01:08:54.440
Unless your racket dots have a feel.
Please talk.

1028
01:08:54.450 --> 01:08:59.250
Get your fingers over them.
We'll bring them up.

1029
01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:01.733
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1030
01:09:01.830 --> 01:09:06.360
Just unlace your patent leather pants in public and what kind of sent you think

1031
01:09:06.361 --> 01:09:10.920
he has going on down there?
Get strong.
Those pants are not bear out into soap.

1032
01:09:10.921 --> 01:09:13.740
We know that.
We know that his pants were not very poorest either.

1033
01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:18.730
If you're wearing patent leather,
and I know that from my golf days,
a lot of uh,

1034
01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:21.840
overweight golf girls will wear patent leather pants and,

1035
01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:25.180
and I hear it's not good.
Not good for your junk

1036
01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:30.210
<v 12>smell.
Look at different times of the day in the morning when you wake up,
folded</v>

1037
01:09:32.310 --> 01:09:34.710
going back.
Good photo of you nuts.
Yeah,

1038
01:09:37.150 --> 01:09:40.440
<v 3>you should do that.
I can't take this.
I've done this so I can,</v>

1039
01:09:40.570 --> 01:09:44.050
of course every guy in the world is doing,
but I've never done it in training.

1040
01:09:44.051 --> 01:09:47.400
I'm saying I do it straight without training their omics.

1041
01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:50.680
I need this guy to tell you how to grab your nuts and smell your fingers

1042
01:09:51.130 --> 01:09:55.420
<v 12>after you've done that.
Reach further back.
Oh,
run your finger along your crack.</v>

1043
01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:58.240
If you Ross,
you don't need to figure your whole,

1044
01:09:58.330 --> 01:09:59.950
you don't want to come back with shit on your finger.

1045
01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:04.510
Just run your finger over [inaudible] crack.
Oh God.

1046
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:06.310
Bring it up and smell.

1047
01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:08.930
<v 3>We've got to show us and my parents next.</v>

1048
01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.800
See what they think of this.

1049
01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:17.070
<v 12>So take your time out while you're at work and working with cubicles.</v>

1050
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:21.730
Cubicle your cubicle.
Do this.
Have the fondel have a quick sniff.
Yeah.

1051
01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:25.130
When you get home as you take off your ass,

1052
01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:31.780
can I get deep with,
have a very good deep Smith Smith.

1053
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:35.810
The different parts of your underwear.
Learn what your ass smells like.

1054
01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:38.030
Coconut balls smell like.

1055
01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.100
<v 3>I think you know,
but now you do.</v>

1056
01:10:40.210 --> 01:10:44.870
You have to learn that smells like that now and make that a really keen sense of

1057
01:10:44.871 --> 01:10:47.010
yours.
Make it a priority as a pop.

1058
01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:49.373
<v 12>Yeah,
we got it.</v>

1059
01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:54.180
Schuman pop really connects with odor and sentence smell.
Yeah.

1060
01:10:54.810 --> 01:10:58.830
That's going to be a primal feeling for you.
Okay.

1061
01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:02.220
<v 3>Oh,
that's Sirius pup.net is what I saw there.</v>

1062
01:11:03.190 --> 01:11:07.930
They did exclude this from the documentary we saw on BBC.
They didn't really,

1063
01:11:07.931 --> 01:11:10.560
uh,
two.
It's the same way.
Yeah.

1064
01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:14.430
Do you really need a training course?
Yeah.

1065
01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:17.160
You know what?
Interestingly enough,

1066
01:11:17.161 --> 01:11:22.080
the very first time I ever saw Bert Kreischer,
he was,

1067
01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:25.200
we were living in the ghetto on your finger along your crack.

1068
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:29.850
And he was pulled up in front of our apartment building and I had just happened

1069
01:11:29.851 --> 01:11:33.810
to be coming in from our garage and I looked out onto the street and I saw a guy

1070
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:38.520
in a big SUV doing this.
Just smelling his hands.
Yes,

1071
01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:41.550
definitely doing what?
The master right trainer.
Right.

1072
01:11:41.610 --> 01:11:44.190
He was sniffing his fingers and I looked out and I go,
oh,

1073
01:11:44.191 --> 01:11:47.220
that's gotta be Bert Kreischer.
Yeah.
And then I went upstairs.
I was like,

1074
01:11:47.221 --> 01:11:51.660
I think Burt's out cry most his groin.
Yeah,
you did.
And I go,
yeah,

1075
01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:55.080
how did you know?
And you go,
there's a guy out there just stolen his fingers.

1076
01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:59.610
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just during the day,

1077
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.370
if you've got a minute in between,
in between jobs.
Yeah.

1078
01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:09.030
If you're not talking to your boss,
unzip your leather pants,

1079
01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:14.280
Untie Hun,
lace them.
That lunatic had them laced up shoes.

1080
01:12:14.281 --> 01:12:18.270
We got to run a,
okay.
I love you.
This is the smells tracked by Dorian.

1081
