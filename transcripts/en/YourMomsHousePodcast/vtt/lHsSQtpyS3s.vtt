Oh fuck.
Oh fuck.

I'm paying less for these high on pain Lafferty.

13
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.730

18
00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:35.390

Thank you very much DJ boy butter.
Uh,
gene,

32
00:02:20.651 --> 00:02:25.330
there's a lot of exciting things to talk about today.
So many things.
Um,

33
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.520
how are you feeling or are we good man?
Yeah,
just making a person.
Same Shit.

34
00:02:30.521 --> 00:02:33.550
Different toilet.
What about you?
You're kind of a big deal now.
I mean,

35
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.140
am I even allowed to share the same errors?
You,
what are you talking about?
Well,

36
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.990
I mean,
do you want to make the big announcement?
Well,
I think we,

37
00:02:40.991 --> 00:02:43.000
I kinda did it on the sea.
I know people,

38
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:46.210
some people skip the beginning when we do.
Yeah.
I know.

39
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.240
We do our day and we do our [inaudible] shed over Charles,

40
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.320
Huh?

41
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.620
The dates and the ads and it's a very important messages you guys should know be

42
00:02:56.621 --> 00:03:00.430
skipping g.
So we do that pre roll and I it in the pre roll

43
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.300
<v 4>last week,
but this week I can get into it more.</v>

44
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:08.950
Why don't I do it after the break here,
after we officially open.
So,

45
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.490
um,
that's it.
Let's just get the show opened and I'll tell you all about it.

46
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.990
All right,
Jean,
I'm 100% a ball hog.
Let's party.

47
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.860
Let's have some fun Lafferty.
Not that good,
but I'm all right,
let's do it.

48
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.730
<v 5>Okay.
My first gang,
Bang,</v>

49
00:03:22.731 --> 00:03:27.731
I didn't know like you're supposed to empty the céline out of the enema things.

50
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.300
So it like really did the laxative effect and I just like volcanoes,
Shit.

51
00:03:33.301 --> 00:03:34.610
Like all over everybody.

52
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.240
And it was like the worst and like I was crying in the bathroom.

53
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:39.813
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

54
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.843
<v 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

55
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.300
So she's saying the first anal scene did was a gang bang,
it sounds like.

56
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.500
Oh it's her first anal ever.
She's really cute.
I think she's really cute.
Young,

57
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.970
very young to do her first anal gang.
Bang.

58
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.070
She may not be 20 years old.
So I guess this is a video.

59
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.840
Blue bands sent this of a supposed to be embarrassing moments for people.

60
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.100
Can we just start with what she said?
Sorry.
Sartre.
Like John Paul,

61
00:04:20.101 --> 00:04:22.950
she must be related to the famous French philosopher is very,

62
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.900
maybe they have similar philosophies.
Similar.
I think is how you pronounce that.

63
00:04:26.901 --> 00:04:30.620
Later.
We learned that similar,
we learned from love after lock up.

64
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.280
Similar
job,
Paul's salts.

65
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.060
What is the most known for?
Okay.

66
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.070
He's only in my favorite French existentialist philosopher.

67
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.840
He believed that existence is before precedes essence versus essence precedes

68
00:04:47.551 --> 00:04:51.960
existence,
which is what the common thought farms was more before that you're a,

69
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.020
your nature was determined for you and he said,
no,
that's not true.

70
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.820
You can be whoever,
whatever you want to be essentially more or less.

71
00:04:59.821 --> 00:05:01.020
That's a very reductive,

72
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.610
but that reduction of choice is very important to him and God doesn't exist and

73
00:05:05.611 --> 00:05:10.080
all that good stuff.
So then this is totally in line with her granddad's.
No,
no.

74
00:05:10.081 --> 00:05:14.490
This is exactly a mirror of that philosophy.
Yeah.
She made a choice.

75
00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.540
She made a choice to do gang anal and she didn't know how to use the enema.

76
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.140
Alright,
so she's saying that she,
there's,
I don't,

77
00:05:22.141 --> 00:05:27.030
I've never animated myself before.
God,
what are you fucking knew?
Happy.
Of course,

78
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.560
I shouldn't say this all the time and I see is,
well we'll get into that but,

79
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.460
but there's,
I'm assuming there is salient and then she's saying she did.

80
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.740
I'm not sure I understand what the problem was.

81
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.611
<v 5>Okay.</v>

82
00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:43.611
My first I a of speak like you're supposed to empty the céline the enema things.

83
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.070
So it like really did the laxative effect and I just like volcanoes,

84
00:05:50.071 --> 00:05:54.720
shit like all over everybody and it was like the worst and like I was crying in

85
00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:55.554
the bathroom,

86
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.123
<v 4>I cried in the,</v>

87
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.970
I am more effected by her up speak and her vocal fry and then the actual Shitty,

88
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:03.543
I don't care,

89
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.310
but I'm assuming there's like sailing and you're not supposed to put all of it

90
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:08.270
up your ass and she,

91
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.010
she did more than she should have or what I understood from what she,

92
00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.590
just the way that she explains that is that that say lean is not supposed to go

93
00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:17.880
up there at all.
That's what it sounds like.
Oh,

94
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.670
so then why did they put it in the animus first gang bang.
I didn't know.

95
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.120
Like you're supposed to empty the céline out of the enema things out of the

96
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:31.580
enema things.
You're not supposed to put it in yourself.

97
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:35.450
Maybe the céline keeps the Enema,
you know,

98
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.190
fresh smelling like roses.
I don't know.
In other words,

99
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:44.740
that's how you know it's fresh.
You empty it and then you use it.
So she,

100
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.220
she put the salient in herself.
That's how I,
that's what I'm doing.

101
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.350
I'm assuming she knows.

102
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:51.200
I'm assuming you're not supposed to put the salient in your butt.
And she did.

103
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:54.380
She did.
And then she had a lot.
Now here's the thing though.

104
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.670
From what I understand of the enemies is that it's pretty instantaneous.

105
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.910
Like you,
we've seen people give themselves enemas.
The Coffee Lady,

106
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.890
remember you put it up their ass

107
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.970
seeing the light and you kind of wait like five minutes and then you just shut

108
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:13.670
everything out.
So why the time delay?
That's interesting.

109
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.410
I wouldn't understand animals more.

110
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:20.420
I need to know more about this Anima and Charlotte and maybe she would explain

111
00:07:20.781 --> 00:07:25.160
to us.
That's a,
I don't know.
She seems like a nice lady.
I like her.

112
00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:28.820
I feel bad for her that you know that that happened.
Well,
she was also like,

113
00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:30.590
she's over it.
She's like,
I was the first time,

114
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:35.230
but now she's done lots of anal gangbangs and lots of animals and she's fairly

115
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.073
pro.

116
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.590
It's sort of like when you're an open mic or is what I assume the story is like,

117
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.570
you know,
you're like,
God,

118
00:07:41.571 --> 00:07:44.570
I didn't know when I was supposed to go on stage and I believe the light.

119
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.470
I didn't know that meant that I'm ruining the show for everybody.

120
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.980
I love those knuckle tats.
I really do.
And I'm not saying that facetiously.

121
00:07:51.981 --> 00:07:54.200
I know you've talked about it for a long time.

122
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.710
I really don't come to you with them.
I don't,
I don't see them on me either.

123
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.750
But you have a lot of about a tattoo.
The wanting to do the forum thing.
Oh,

124
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.240
I know.
But then it's not me.
It's like we were talking about the person.

125
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.260
You think you are a person.
I'd like to be.
Yeah.
I'm,
I'm a nerd.

126
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:13.490
I'm like that cool clothes.
I'll be like,

127
00:08:13.491 --> 00:08:17.480
that looks cool on somebody else.
Somebody else.
Yeah,
no,
it's not me.

128
00:08:17.481 --> 00:08:19.700
It's not my style.
I can't look how cool she is.

129
00:08:19.701 --> 00:08:23.570
Like she's got very little hair and the cold glasses and I'm just not choker.

130
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:27.290
Is that what it's called?
Yeah,
I do.
Like she's,
she's cool.
I'm not fucking cool.

131
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:31.290
I Dunno.
I can't do gang bang anal.
What'd you do gang bang?

132
00:08:31.291 --> 00:08:35.150
Anal on your first day and all.
I thought that's a very,
uh,
uh,

133
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.010
what's the word I'm looking for?
Ambitious.
No,

134
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.850
it's very ambitious and we don't recommend it when we shoot scenes.

135
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:46.880
We were recommended for,
I mean from my production house,
big,

136
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.720
big BGG,
GG,
Beebee,

137
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:55.910
Beebee beebee anal.
That's a lot.
So every guy goes in her butthole.

138
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.740
Hold that with that,
I dunno.
Yeah,
I think so.
Gang Bang.
Anal.
Yeah.

139
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:01.800
I think that's what that means.
All you guys are gonna get in that.

140
00:09:01.801 --> 00:09:06.330
But how much money do you think she got for that?
A couple of grand.
That's it.

141
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.590
I think so.
I'm guessing though,
I wonder how they rate that.
Like is there,

142
00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:13.920
there's a flat rate just for the anal and were like,
Hey,
do you want to shoot?

143
00:09:13.921 --> 00:09:18.921
This scene normally pays a thousand but if you do anal [inaudible] hundred and

144
00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:21.840
then she was like,
whoa.
And then they're like,
hey,

145
00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:26.250
if you let like eight guys get in there and do like two grand,

146
00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.810
but that's what I'm,
yeah,
but that's what I'm saying.

147
00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:30.960
So let's say the baselines 1500 you're doing anal right.

148
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:35.340
And then so the anal is like a flat rate of a thousand and they gave us more

149
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:40.110
than that 1500 and then the agent goes,
but for every additional guy,

150
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.450
yeah,
that's like $100 more.

151
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.960
So in her head she's doing that hooker math of like hooking up is this is

152
00:09:45.961 --> 00:09:48.570
probably like it.
It's not that much.
And then he's like,

153
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.970
you're already letting a guy fuck you in the butt.
Why not let seven?

154
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.220
There's a few more there with it just extends the scene by like 30 minutes.

155
00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.180
Then she's like,
yeah,
all right.
You know what I mean?
I know that agent says,

156
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:04.030
do you want to add a Sunday show ready already there?
I know.

157
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.510
That's what our agent does.
Like what's the big deal?
You're already there.

158
00:10:06.511 --> 00:10:09.450
You May as well let seven more guys come in.
You're Bob.
What's the big deal?

159
00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:14.160
Surely true differences between porn and coffee.
Of course not.

160
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.090
Of course not.
I totally,
I totally get it.
It's like when they tell me they go,

161
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.780
do you want to add a Thursday show?
I'm already there on Thursday.
You Ready?

162
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.500
Making your money and you get greedy.
You see the dollar signs,

163
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:29.400
you know it's one more dick in your ass.
It's another Dick.
It's another dig.

164
00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:31.380
But it's so worth it.
Like you're already lubed up.

165
00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.870
Just fucking do seem to do this scene.

166
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.200
It still makes me laugh that we call porno movies.

167
00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:41.090
See like there seems to work tomorrow,
right?

168
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:45.180
Like it's not because we should call them different things cause people that

169
00:10:45.181 --> 00:10:49.620
make legit movies,
they shoot scenes.
These are scenes too,
but they're different.

170
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.580
I know,
I know.
They are very different.
Not that I'm judging.
I'm very,

171
00:10:53.581 --> 00:10:55.380
I like pornography and I'm very pro.

172
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.130
I'm pro porn to pornography and people making a living however they have to.

173
00:10:59.131 --> 00:11:01.890
But it's funny that you should call it.
Yeah,
it's on a scene.

174
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.720
You know what I'm saying?
And they're acting and they kind of are proof.

175
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:08.700
It's performative.
Definitely.
Yeah,
that's true.

176
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.010
It's not like regular amateurs laying around having sex.
No,
it's,
it's hard.

177
00:11:14.011 --> 00:11:16.530
She just took,
yeah.
How many decks in her,

178
00:11:16.531 --> 00:11:20.700
but I don't know that we just know it was an anal Gangbang.
Oof.
Here's another,

179
00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:24.880
that's gotta be so painful and you're another war story.
Loved.
I love the shine.

180
00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:27.500
I can't think of like an embarrassing,
I'm kidding.

181
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.930
<v 6>Like I'm not afraid to like act like an idiot at time.
You know,</v>

182
00:11:30.931 --> 00:11:34.560
like if you're doing an angel,
maybe some people might come out.
Um,

183
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.900
if you're stuck in some day,
can you do an a little bit too,
too?
Um,
too much.

184
00:11:39.901 --> 00:11:42.960
You know,
you may throw up over the cock,
he is the number of things,

185
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:44.640
but you just call him like,
hey,
whatever,

186
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:49.550
<v 4>wipe and go.
No,
that would really,
that would not be fun for you.</v>

187
00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:53.830
It's definitely not for me.
No,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm in the though or not,

188
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.530
but I kind of get it like,
you know,

189
00:11:56.531 --> 00:11:59.140
especially after having given birth once already,
I don't do it.

190
00:11:59.141 --> 00:12:01.990
Like today we went for an ultrasound and the nurse was like,
oh,

191
00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.520
I'll leave the room so you can take your pants off and not right.

192
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:09.790
No need no fucking care.
You're going to look at my badge and two seconds.

193
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:13.070
I think the more kids people have to the last day.
You care about modesty and,

194
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:17.500
dude,
what are you kidding me?
Oh,
my body's a fucking village.
Good.

195
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:22.600
Me Too.
I'm always like,
I'm old now.
You can look.
Doesn't matter.

196
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.620
Okay.
Who sees it rising good here.
It's your problem.

197
00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.680
Like you have to look at this pile of shit.
Go for it.

198
00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:34.120
Yeah.
Oh,
I look like I've had multiple kids.

199
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.080
Your body looks better now than it ever has.
What are you talking about?

200
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:39.880
I feel like it looks like I've had triplets.

201
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.510
You look better now than you did when we first started dating.

202
00:12:43.511 --> 00:12:45.460
You look fantastic.
No,
not then.

203
00:12:45.461 --> 00:12:48.100
We first started dating when we first got married and that when we first started

204
00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:51.370
dating,
yes.
You look fit.
You look just like you did we first started any?
No,

205
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:55.660
you're skinny.
You're fit.
You look great.
Please.
Are you talking about Peyton?

206
00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:00.070
Peyton knows the truth.
Give yourselves my body's all stretched out.

207
00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.730
I think I would be bothered more by this shit if I was the guy doing the scene

208
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:08.070
by brown bear brown than Puke.
I mean personally,
I mean I'm not in a metaphor.

209
00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.340
I mean I know it because vomit smells horrible hate volume,

210
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:14.020
but shit would be like a real like I don't know.

211
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:19.320
I'm trying to think what could I recover from more quickly as far as any day.

212
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.040
I Dunno when I,

213
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.200
I could stranger shitty some version of being excited by the vomit occurring

214
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:34.330
because of my pee pee down her mouth.
Sure.

215
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.020
So I'd be like,
that's pretty cool.
I did that,
I did that.
But the Poop,

216
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:42.790
I'd be like her and it's a stranger shit.
It's not like your beloved's.
No,
I know.

217
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.760
Cause if I that it's shit right.

218
00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:52.540
That put too much salient.
But before the scene shot.
Cause if I shit on you,

219
00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:57.060
would you even be phased?
No,
nothing.
Nothing about you would faze me.
Yeah.

220
00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.700
Nothing.
Same.
I mean I don't know.
It would feel weird to be all warm.

221
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:04.000
Like I always picture the temperature of something like that.
It's warm.
Yeah,

222
00:14:04.001 --> 00:14:07.810
like a hot turd.
Their bar,
they're both warm.
The puke and the,

223
00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:11.470
I don't like that the shit will be a little extra hot.

224
00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:15.040
I think this is more weight to it.
Yeah.
Oof.

225
00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:20.010
A pukes harder to clean out those tap it out of our own show
uttered.

226
00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.850
You could just kind of pick up unless it's diarrhea at a wash and you gotta

227
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:25.930
shower you of course you have to share on both cases.
Yeah.

228
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:28.430
This guys is pretty funny.
This guy is here.

229
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:32.050
<v 7>You know what?
This sometimes is a bit embarrassing when you come,</v>

230
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:37.230
when you come to a point is that you know like you think you don't know the girl

231
00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:44.850
very nice to meet the the screen and then it goes here is you don't remember.

232
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:47.930
You did my first barker.
I'll see him.
Boy,

233
00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:52.010
most of the time after when the girls say it's like you remember then you know

234
00:14:52.011 --> 00:14:56.030
like everything starts working in the brain and then you kind of like look back

235
00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:01.420
500 625 and a half scenes and then somehow it comes slowly blurry back.

236
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:08.600
Yeah.
And then there is a moment and you're like all rather remember

237
00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.450
<v 4>you could totally be your dad's story about it and any number of people you've</v>

238
00:15:12.451 --> 00:15:17.010
met.
Well of course I'm thinking more of his accent,
but yeah,
of course.
Yeah.
No,

239
00:15:17.011 --> 00:15:19.740
his accent.
But he could have the same story.
You can be like,
nice to meet you.

240
00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:22.890
Yeah,
I've never,
and then she'd be like,
excuse me,
you don't remember me?
No.

241
00:15:22.891 --> 00:15:27.450
Easily.
I want to ask him,
right?
Yes.
Miami beach.
Yeah.
I wanted to ask my dad,

242
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.090
how many women do you think you've slept with?
And he said,
not enough.

243
00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:34.410
That's a great answer.
And see it is a funny,
funny answer,
but yeah,
I'll clearly,

244
00:15:34.411 --> 00:15:38.400
easily,
I mean,
yeah,
no,
I don't think my dad ever did it for a living,

245
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:42.740
but this guy legit.
Has this happened all the time?
Yeah.
You realize that?
Oh,

246
00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:47.540
he's like,
yeah.
Oh yeah.
That's weird.
Right?
You're like a half.

247
00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:51.260
I had sex with you.
Hi Jackie.
Related inside of you.
I think I did.
Yeah,

248
00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:52.530
I think I remember you.

249
00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.570
You know what's interesting too is that they call it boy girl,
girl boy.

250
00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:00.150
Is that a male,
female or woman or man,

251
00:16:00.151 --> 00:16:03.770
it's also very infantilized in a weird thought of that.
That's true.
Right?

252
00:16:03.771 --> 00:16:05.570
Like it's a,
it's by growl,

253
00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:09.390
but it's like you can hear this is a pretty good point of what the dumb slot.

254
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.540
Yeah.
As I,
as I bug out by God,

255
00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:18.260
you can hear her damage talking.
That's why bag.

256
00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.390
<v 8>Yeah.
Yeah.
There she is.</v>

257
00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:24.683
<v 4>Hello.</v>

258
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:29.770
<v 8>I actually needs a cream pie scene.</v>

259
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:34.800
It was like one of my first scenes in industry and was totally fine.

260
00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:40.390
The whole scene.
And we go to do the final shot and um,

261
00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.100
it's a cream pie,

262
00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:46.690
so he's pulling out of me and instead of a cream pie,

263
00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:48.430
it was a period pie.

264
00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:53.290
<v 4>Oh.
Oh no,
it was a strawberry shortcake.
Yeah.
Damn.</v>

265
00:16:53.291 --> 00:16:56.170
These girls go varsity on their first season.
She's like,

266
00:16:56.171 --> 00:16:58.180
it's one of my first scenes.
Do you think they like,

267
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.040
but she might've made that extra 40 bucks.

268
00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.870
That's good for the extra hundred or the agent.
It's the agent.
Yeah.
Age is like,

269
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:04.990
he's go by the morning after pill.

270
00:17:04.991 --> 00:17:09.650
You got 40 bucks in your pocket now or is it my phone yet?
Yup.
That's uh,

271
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:15.070
by,
uh,
two tickets to the movies and get coke and fucking popcorn.

272
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.400
And you know,
they weren't thrilled.
You know,
that the set,

273
00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.850
the director was not sympathetic.
And like you said,
it's the rule of the scene.

274
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.430
That's the part that actually makes me sad.
Yeah.

275
00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.010
Because the story is kind of like,
ah,
I,

276
00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.120
I empathize with how embarrassing that would be for her.
Yeah,
you're right.

277
00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.840
They'd be like,
great,
now I don't even fucking have a cream pie.

278
00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.780
Is there the whole point?
Yeah.
She's like,
I'm sorry.

279
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.170
How long did this period shit last with you?
God,

280
00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.420
I remember Jules Ventura when she was in here,

281
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:50.820
we asked her how she deals with the period and she said they put a sponge up

282
00:17:50.821 --> 00:17:54.450
there.
Oof.
Just for people who are curious that yeah,

283
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.530
they just put a sponge and then you can work when you're still having your

284
00:17:58.531 --> 00:17:59.360
period.

285
00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.970
<v 0>I didn't realize that you actually did some porn cause it looks like you're here</v>

286
00:18:01.971 --> 00:18:03.050
talking about this one.

287
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:08.390
<v 9>Probably trying to like be sexy for some social media thing and passing gas on</v>

288
00:18:08.401 --> 00:18:09.990
the camera.
Trying to be like funny.

289
00:18:09.991 --> 00:18:12.470
They sexy like oh it's work from you real quick.
And I like,

290
00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:18.140
the thing is it was almost like live stream so it could even be like taken down.

291
00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.150
It was just on their life.

292
00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:24.820
<v 4>That's hilarious.
Foreign gene.
Oh Geez.
I'm worried.</v>

293
00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.710
That would definitely be your story.
You'd be like,
oh I found this.
Yeah,

294
00:18:27.711 --> 00:18:30.590
but here's the thing.
That would be my whole genre.
They'd be like,

295
00:18:30.591 --> 00:18:32.810
you're the bigger the fart person on the foreign ministers.
Yeah.

296
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:37.810
I wouldn't even fuck,
I wouldn't do any of the anal or any Korean pouch.

297
00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:38.750
All farts,

298
00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:43.890
all farts bar as far as just far as video can never find that drop on it.

299
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.810
That's the easiest one to do as a fart stuff.
Are you kidding me?

300
00:18:47.811 --> 00:18:52.160
Far and it's already in my lane.
Yeah,
I know.

301
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:56.360
Right.
Where is that for and dammit,

302
00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:01.030
I can never find it far.
Shaft a r t.
Um,

303
00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:02.773
all right,
so we should

304
00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:06.100
<v 0>probably tell him right now.
You're talking about your boy girl,
boy,
girl.</v>

305
00:19:06.101 --> 00:19:07.060
So this is what happened.

306
00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.550
I mentioned it in the last pre roll and I said I would get it.

307
00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:13.510
I didn't want to do it in that pre-roll because that was after we had shot the

308
00:19:13.511 --> 00:19:17.530
video and recorded the episode and then you would have only some audio of it and

309
00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:19.180
not on the video.
It didn't make sense.

310
00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:24.460
I had to move my Salt Lake City shows.

311
00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:30.040
Um,
surely,
surely teddy shows and I had to cancel Australia.

312
00:19:30.041 --> 00:19:33.520
Even looking for a date to come back.

313
00:19:33.521 --> 00:19:37.690
It's a little more complicated when you go abroad.
Far Away Monster.
Um,
yeah.

314
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:42.630
But the reason why is because I booked a role in a major motion

315
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:45.410
<v 4>picture movie.
Where's the chips in a bowl?</v>

316
00:19:45.411 --> 00:19:48.380
Where is the fucking cat eating kibble?
You didn't even prepare.

317
00:19:48.381 --> 00:19:52.060
This is a big announcement.
Oh,
well you know,
sometimes you don't get there.

318
00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:03.130
<v 10>Where's the cat eating kibble?
I don't have that one,
but</v>

319
00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:06.190
<v 0>it was,
I'm really excited about it actually.
Of course you are.</v>

320
00:20:06.191 --> 00:20:08.350
It's your first boy girl scene that you've ever done.

321
00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:12.310
Here's a all I was thinking for,
for people that don't know if you had asked me,

322
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:17.050
uh,
just over 16 years ago when I got here,

323
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:20.050
if you'd asked me what do you think you'll probably end up doing it and you

324
00:20:20.051 --> 00:20:25.051
think you'll be working making a living as a standup comedian or as an actor in

325
00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:29.410
like shows and movies.
I would be like a hundred percent as an actor.

326
00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:31.620
There's no way I'm doing standup.

327
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.010
But that's what I would have thought if you'd ask.

328
00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.020
<v 4>Yeah,
I can take my mind back to,
to that time,
you know,</v>

329
00:20:36.021 --> 00:20:37.180
cause that's what you really want.

330
00:20:37.181 --> 00:20:41.600
And I remember that's what I could imagine shortly after you landed here in la

331
00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:45.560
and that was like your,
your thing,
you were an actor,
you were in a play.
Yeah,

332
00:20:45.561 --> 00:20:49.210
that's right.
You were doing classes were really,
isn't it interesting though,

333
00:20:49.211 --> 00:20:53.560
how life kind of give to a detour know,
and I remember,
you know for

334
00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:57.030
<v 0>a lot of people do this,
when they come out here,
they sign up for one of the,</v>

335
00:20:57.031 --> 00:21:01.800
you know,
it's Io,
it's a UCB Improv Olympics,
Improv Olympics,

336
00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:06.330
uh,
the Groundlings.
And then what's the Chicago based one?
A second city,

337
00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:09.450
second city.
So when I moved out here,

338
00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:15.330
I looked up,
I saw that like will Ferrell and some other couple other people,

339
00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.820
uh,
were from the Groundlings and I was like,
that's where I'm going to go.
Yeah,

340
00:21:18.821 --> 00:21:23.760
I did that one too.
So I went to the Groundlings,
I eye test,

341
00:21:23.761 --> 00:21:28.350
I tested and I got to skip a level and then I did a series with them and then I

342
00:21:28.351 --> 00:21:32.220
did level two with them.
And then you go to this thing called writing lab,

343
00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.650
but you have to wait for it,
they call you.
And then when,

344
00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.770
then it's about writing your marriage when you got that.
And when they called me,

345
00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:43.760
I had just started making $50 a set emceeing,

346
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.070
like getting paid to do shows.
And I was a couple of years in to stand up.

347
00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.670
And I remember even though I wanted to take it,
I go,

348
00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.170
it was kind of that thing that you go,

349
00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:57.060
do I go do that or do I put more into the thing that's already kind of starting

350
00:21:57.061 --> 00:22:00.150
to work for him?
Right.
And I thought,
you know,
if I go do that,

351
00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.400
it's going to take away from this standup thing that I'm,

352
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:05.930
it's not just that I'm making money doing it instead,
I'm enjoying doing,
I'm,
I'm,

353
00:22:05.931 --> 00:22:09.370
I'm working at it now.
And so I passed on it and they go,
well,

354
00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:14.100
we'll only call you one more time to see if you wouldn't do it the next time.

355
00:22:14.101 --> 00:22:18.540
And I said,
okay.
They called again,
I passed again.

356
00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:22.770
And then it was like,
Hey,
I'm,
I'm doing stand up full,
you know,
full throttle.

357
00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.730
And then I did,
you know,
I did a number of auditions,
um,

358
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:32.250
for different things,
you know,
and I booked that huge subway campaign,

359
00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.710
<v 4>which if you've never heard this,
I mean,</v>

360
00:22:34.711 --> 00:22:39.090
it was pretty nutty that at one point you were going to play Jerrod's derelict

361
00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:39.730
brother.

362
00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:41.350
<v 0>Yeah.
On a like a,</v>

363
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:45.680
this would have been so that flow from a,

364
00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:50.580
<v 4>the progress she's made a fortune be flow.
The way that this was presented to me,</v>

365
00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.470
<v 0>you are going to be the,
you know,</v>

366
00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.880
the counter to Jared on subway and if this,

367
00:22:58.881 --> 00:23:01.880
these ads work out,
it's just going to run all the time.
It'll be your life.
Now.

368
00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:05.020
<v 4>I remember when you got that in,
you and I were like,
oh my God,</v>

369
00:23:05.021 --> 00:23:09.080
you're going to be a millionaire.
Oh yeah,
this is crazy.
This is crazy,
man.

370
00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:13.240
I was 25.
I know.
That's how long ago that was.
I know in 2005 flew to New York.

371
00:23:13.241 --> 00:23:17.500
We shot commercials.
Here's the thing,
there are commercials somewhere.

372
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:22.150
Somebody has these and uh,
you know,
I dunno,
I've never gotten a hold of them,

373
00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.200
but they just never aired.
And the reason they air right

374
00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:28.340
<v 0>was fate that my agent didn't even know.
You know,</v>

375
00:23:28.341 --> 00:23:29.540
who I think notified me,

376
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:34.190
I want to say it was Larson and I want to say because he read something,

377
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:37.640
what happened was unrelated to the campaign,

378
00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.350
it had nothing to do with the campaign.

379
00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:43.490
The VP of marketing at subway resigned.

380
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.140
He resigned.

381
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.990
And this is a common thing in any business practice.
Uh,

382
00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.590
he resigned because he was of age.
He was 60 something years old.

383
00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.060
A new VP is high.
So the new VP of marketing,

384
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:04.300
what they do is you kill all the other guys ideas for two reasons.

385
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.190
If they're bad and they don't work out,
they'd be like,

386
00:24:07.191 --> 00:24:11.150
what the fuck did you keep that for?
Right.
You should.
Yeah.
And if they're good,

387
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.510
then you're basically crediting your predecessor.
You know what I mean?

388
00:24:14.511 --> 00:24:16.360
So you don't want,
it's like in the,

389
00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:20.300
in the wild when Elian takes over a family.
That's right.

390
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:24.140
He kills all the young of the lioness and then reproduce it for themselves,

391
00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:29.060
their own made.
And that's a very common practice in,
in major corporates,
evil.

392
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:34.070
So I have a sip here.
I didn't even get to see if they worked out.

393
00:24:34.071 --> 00:24:39.071
I just got the call that the campaign was dead and I was like heartbroken mostly

394
00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:43.520
because I was like,
this was going to be a huge jump,
you know,

395
00:24:43.521 --> 00:24:47.090
a big platform for me to get on.
And be funny.
The commercials were funny,

396
00:24:47.091 --> 00:24:49.480
you know,
they're their corporate commercial funder.

397
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.670
Your ads memorize that song by rat round and round.

398
00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:58.190
They licensed that song and I'd be like driving up and sing in that and then I

399
00:24:58.191 --> 00:25:02.390
crashed my car into this thing at a port Jareds fuck up brother.

400
00:25:02.391 --> 00:25:05.780
And then you had the whole idea was for people.
Some of you may have heard it,

401
00:25:05.781 --> 00:25:06.680
but if you haven't heard it,

402
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:11.950
the reason was Jared could only push healthy subs and they're like,

403
00:25:12.471 --> 00:25:17.390
we need to be able to advertise unhealthy ups.
And they're like,

404
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:18.490
you could do that time.

405
00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:23.020
So while Jared would say Turkey sub,
it's healthy,

406
00:25:23.021 --> 00:25:25.340
I go chicken parms not bad either.

407
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.310
And then that would be the Ed,
you know?
That's right.

408
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:33.940
You were like the slovenly brother that could plug all the analysis.

409
00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.500
The downside of being just the subway ad guy,

410
00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:44.180
of course I have the added benefit that if that had worked out,

411
00:25:44.181 --> 00:25:47.060
I would now be associated with a convicted child.

412
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:51.680
Pornographer serving major that,

413
00:25:51.681 --> 00:25:55.880
and I think it would have affected your standup material shore because it's a

414
00:25:55.881 --> 00:25:57.890
major corporation and they would not,

415
00:25:57.891 --> 00:26:01.670
you would not be making the jokes that you'd make their special.

416
00:26:01.671 --> 00:26:05.240
Or the worst thing would be,
you know,
I could just stand up,

417
00:26:05.241 --> 00:26:09.050
but everyone would be like,
tell us to eat fresh.
Like dude,
the fucking line.

418
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:10.640
I'd be like,
all right.

419
00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:14.540
And then I'd have like subs kind of carved it out to the stage,

420
00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:18.140
making jokes about food.
It'll be fucking blurb because on the one hand,

421
00:26:18.141 --> 00:26:21.950
it's kind of a guilt.
It's a gilded cage.
Like the girl that does flow,

422
00:26:21.951 --> 00:26:25.870
that progressive girl,
she was an act like an Improv actress.
I remember.

423
00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:28.730
She's great,
she's really great and she does a great job with those ads.

424
00:26:28.731 --> 00:26:32.750
But I'm saying that you're kind of locked in as an identity.
Like that's it.

425
00:26:32.751 --> 00:26:36.500
She's flow forever.
And in our business it's very hard to get out of that.

426
00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.860
It's hard to get out of.
But the upside is that she has probably great

427
00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.890
and she's,
you know,
she's got it,

428
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:47.760
but it'd be very hard to do anything else creatively,
I think for her.
So,

429
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:52.890
so there's that that goes down.
You know,
I do a couple of other commercials.

430
00:26:52.891 --> 00:26:57.850
I did a dominoes ESPN one I partnered up.
Yeah.

431
00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:02.480
Then I did a couple other commercials.
I'm trying to remember.
Oh,

432
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:06.530
I remember you did dot.
Yes.
Right.
And then,
um,

433
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.970
no,
that wasn't with cat.
You did a sitcom.
You did Jay [inaudible].

434
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.860
I did a couple of things on him and then like I booked,

435
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.280
try to think of the things I,
I booked a episode of workaholics were,

436
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:22.900
I had a great scene that got cut out entirely.
That was going to be like my,

437
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:26.310
all right.
Like I booked a great scene.
I booked a scene on,

438
00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:31.020
was it pushing up daisies,
the ABC show where it wasn't.

439
00:27:31.021 --> 00:27:36.021
I had one scene with let's say five or six lines and they cut it down to one

440
00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:40.290
word.
So all these things where you're like,
Jesus Christ.
And I,
by the way,

441
00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:45.030
as that's happening,
I'm moving further along in standup.
So I'm like,

442
00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:48.390
I kind of just see it as like this side thing where I'm like,
you know,

443
00:27:48.391 --> 00:27:51.810
I really wished this would work out,
but it just is not,
you know.

444
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:54.660
But the point being that you've had,
it's pretty ridiculous.

445
00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:56.880
16 years of near misses.

446
00:27:56.890 --> 00:28:01.470
Like you quite literally like you get cast in the big Setcom but your line gets

447
00:28:01.471 --> 00:28:02.250
cut out.

448
00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:07.250
You get flown out to New York to try out for the producers to read for this

449
00:28:07.621 --> 00:28:09.300
movie.
That's the most recent one.

450
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.610
I don't remember if we talked about on this show.
We did not,

451
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:16.350
but I didn't want to give away.
I Dunno.
It's like,
like kind of insight.

452
00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:19.590
So I flew out,
I tested for,

453
00:28:19.591 --> 00:28:22.980
I auditioned for a movie over the summer and uh,

454
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:26.880
the audition went really well and then they flew me to New York to test.

455
00:28:26.881 --> 00:28:31.710
So when you test,
they basically have producers in the room,

456
00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:33.420
like higher ups,
the director,

457
00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:37.860
and then you're also on film with somebody who is cast in the movie.

458
00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:42.620
And it's usually between you and like a handful maybe of other people.
Yeah.

459
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:46.260
In this case it was one other person.
All right.
Wow.

460
00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:50.160
It gave me the heads up.
You were really close.
Yeah.
And here's the thing,

461
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:54.630
I even though when I didn't get it,
I was bummed party,
you start to go like,

462
00:28:54.631 --> 00:28:59.631
just kind of make sense because here's the thing you learned about film casting.

463
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:04.560
Almost all the financers in film go look at things like,

464
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.920
well what else have they done?
And this is like the,

465
00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:13.170
the screwy circle of,
of this,
of things not working out is that they'll go,

466
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:16.050
well,
act or one has never done anything.

467
00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:20.520
Actor two's been in 10 movies in three television shows.
And then they go,

468
00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.180
oh well we want it to be the proven actor.

469
00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.070
So they go with Acthar to which happened to be in that movie.

470
00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:28.470
They called me and he goes,
um,

471
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:32.100
the other actor was a well known actor and he goes,

472
00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:33.540
they gave it to him and I was like,
yeah,

473
00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:38.930
they're going to give it to them every time because he's a proven entity.

474
00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:42.040
And that's why it's so hard to break into things like

475
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.650
<v 4>Sitcom or a film because a lot of the,
first of all,</v>

476
00:29:44.651 --> 00:29:49.360
a lot of sick time actors have been doing [inaudible] since they were four and

477
00:29:49.361 --> 00:29:52.150
they've been in the system.
There's a system that Kinda,
you know,

478
00:29:52.151 --> 00:29:53.650
it's the same people over and over again.

479
00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.530
That's why you see the same five actors,
uh,

480
00:29:56.531 --> 00:29:59.800
doing everything in the Sitcom world and in the film world.
Cause you're kind of,

481
00:29:59.801 --> 00:30:02.020
once you're in early,
you're in,
you're in the system.

482
00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:05.230
It's really hard to break in.
I almost didn't go in on this audition.

483
00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:08.890
It's the right [inaudible] just booked.
That's the funniest thing.

484
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:10.270
Oh that's right.
I remember you were like,

485
00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:11.251
<v 0>don't know,</v>

486
00:30:11.251 --> 00:30:15.630
like when you get an audition at first it comes in an email and it just says you

487
00:30:15.631 --> 00:30:19.590
have an audition,
you know,
this Friday and it has all the details.

488
00:30:19.591 --> 00:30:23.970
Has the breakdown of the part,
what it is,
who's directing it,
who wrote it.

489
00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:26.970
Sometimes it has wind,
it'll shoot and then it has,

490
00:30:26.971 --> 00:30:29.850
you know where the audition is.
So it was the week,

491
00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:34.770
the week after my special came out and I'm doing all this press every day.

492
00:30:34.771 --> 00:30:38.760
It's like you're doing a TV thing,
you're doing two things with this.

493
00:30:38.761 --> 00:30:41.950
You're doing Conan,
you're doing radio that you're going to test.

494
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.960
In the middle of all that.
I pick up my phone,

495
00:30:45.961 --> 00:30:50.430
it says you have a audition,
you know this day.
And I'm like,

496
00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.010
all right.
I don't,
I don't even,
I just don't even answer.

497
00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:57.910
The next day I have all like three more things at press.
Then I get,
uh,

498
00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:01.860
an email says,
can we confirm you for the audition?
And I just wrote like,
no,

499
00:31:01.861 --> 00:31:05.280
I got too much going on.
Which is not unusual.

500
00:31:05.281 --> 00:31:09.420
I pass on a lot of auditions because of our schedules.
Like we have touring,

501
00:31:09.421 --> 00:31:13.560
schedule our kid things in our own,
you know,
we have things going on.

502
00:31:13.561 --> 00:31:18.510
So most of the time I would say I consider those things and I'll turn down

503
00:31:18.511 --> 00:31:22.950
auditions,
you know?
So this time my agent happened to call me.

504
00:31:22.951 --> 00:31:27.060
He never calls when I say I can't make it to this,
and he goes,

505
00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:30.000
the director requested to see you for this.

506
00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:33.030
I really think you should try to go in.
So I'm like,
okay,

507
00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:36.750
well get me a new day because I can't do it.

508
00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:40.240
<v 4>Yeah.
Well the other thing that people don't know if you're not in the Chavez,</v>

509
00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:44.160
they always have like a,
we get your time,
here's the time and you can't,

510
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:47.940
it's really hard to change that.
They tell you the time and that's it.

511
00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:52.470
And like you could not have an childcare,
you can be on the other side of town.

512
00:31:52.471 --> 00:31:53.390
And I don't care

513
00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.610
<v 0>for other,
for people that don't,</v>

514
00:31:55.700 --> 00:32:00.620
aren't aware that sometimes you get a 6:00 PM 6:37 PM it'll say,

515
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:04.430
hey,
you have an audition tomorrow morning at 10:00 AM and you're like,

516
00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:07.340
it's a prepared.
Like,
I mean,
I have this kid,

517
00:32:07.341 --> 00:32:10.940
I'm going to put them down and I mean,
how am I going to be ready for that?

518
00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:15.050
It's like that.
It'll happen that quickly,
you know?
Yeah.
So anyways,

519
00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:19.100
I take the,
of course after he tells me that I take the audition,

520
00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:23.000
I go on it.
Uh,
I thought it went really well.

521
00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:26.870
But that's the thing is most of the time when you audition and you think it goes

522
00:32:26.871 --> 00:32:29.780
well,
nope.
Never even hear anything.

523
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:32.300
And sometimes when you think the addition went poorly,

524
00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:35.330
they'll call you and be like,
you have a call back.
You're going back to see me.

525
00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:38.030
Like what?
So you just never know the formula

526
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:44.620
the director told me or gave my agent some feedback and then was like,

527
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.830
tell him to come to my house now.
He didn't say tell him.

528
00:32:48.831 --> 00:32:52.310
He said tell him to give him my number.
And then I talked to him and he's like,

529
00:32:52.311 --> 00:32:56.150
do you want to work on the scene?
And I was like,
sure,
sorry,

530
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:58.200
I have to leave for your back and the shower.

531
00:32:58.201 --> 00:33:02.660
Is it a 3:00 AM kind of meeting or what's going to go on?
So now,

532
00:33:02.661 --> 00:33:04.670
but he was like super,

533
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:10.750
I dunno this the nicest like guy in this business I think that I've ever met is

534
00:33:12.411 --> 00:33:16.910
this director.
I went over there,
we talked about the scene.
We,

535
00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:21.380
we ran it a few times.
How many,
what was it,
a boy?
Girl.
Girl.
Boy.
Boy.
Boy.

536
00:33:21.381 --> 00:33:23.950
Cause it was just the two of us.
It was just boy.

537
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.530
And did you give yourself an animal before the scene?
I took all the salient out,

538
00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:31.850
but I did do that just to make sure.
And then it's like,
hey,
you know,

539
00:33:31.851 --> 00:33:32.780
he worked on it.
Then he's like,

540
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:37.810
oh you still have to go back and test and then you still have to get approved by

541
00:33:39.081 --> 00:33:42.650
the all the other producers and the studio executives parent May.

542
00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:47.570
It's so nerve wracking.
Well I,
but I also was I think with age,

543
00:33:47.571 --> 00:33:50.960
like how long I've been doing this.
I was like,
yeah,
okay,
sure.

544
00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:55.460
And then I was also cool with the fact that they might say,
hey,
you know,
you,

545
00:33:56.210 --> 00:34:00.620
they liked you but no one needs another movie.
Well anyone,
you know,

546
00:34:00.621 --> 00:34:02.750
I just kind of was just like,
yeah,
that's fine.
I mean,

547
00:34:02.751 --> 00:34:06.380
I understood that it's likely not going to happen.

548
00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:11.330
So it just kind of liberating.
It is kind of in the,
well,
I'm swinging for,

549
00:34:11.331 --> 00:34:11.870
you know,

550
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:15.260
the back of the room here and if it doesn't happen it probably won't happen.

551
00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:17.890
And I also realized that like,
you know,
it doesn't,

552
00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:22.160
it's not my livelihood and thank God I don't rely on it to have my bills paid or

553
00:34:22.161 --> 00:34:26.420
anything.
You know,
it was like
in the figure skating world,

554
00:34:26.421 --> 00:34:29.360
they've already won the metal and you could tell there's so much more relaxed

555
00:34:29.361 --> 00:34:33.620
when they're doing those moves in the rank.
Right.
Totally way looking at it.
Yes.

556
00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:37.490
He already got the,
you already have your gold medal in standup.
So,
and then uh,

557
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:41.510
oh.
Then the director texted me,
give me a call when you can't.
I'm like,

558
00:34:41.511 --> 00:34:46.310
motherfucker,
like he's being nice with to tell me that,

559
00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:48.320
you know,
it's always that one.
It's a community.

560
00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.770
I didn't get it cause he was so nice.
I thought he's going to be like,

561
00:34:51.771 --> 00:34:56.180
I just want you to know that love you.
You're my favorite.
Give him a call.

562
00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:59.420
And he's like,
hey man,
you're doing the movie.
You both so crazy.

563
00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:04.040
I couldn't believe it.
I really was overjoyed.
Like I said,

564
00:35:04.041 --> 00:35:07.580
it's just something I've wanted to do for so long.
So long gene.

565
00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.600
So the movie shoots in Atlanta,
um,

566
00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:14.510
it's starring Mark Wahlberg,
crazy.
Rose Byrne,

567
00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:19.610
Octavia Spencer.
Uh,
there's a couple other comics and it,
tig Notaro was in it.

568
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:23.930
Oh,
Eliza slessinger is in it.
Um,
not anyways,

569
00:35:23.931 --> 00:35:26.870
it's a great cast and a great script and I'm just,

570
00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:28.790
I can't believe that I get to do it.

571
00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:33.470
Who's your fucking movie by movie white?
Of course.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Allen.
Rachel,

572
00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:34.333
she's great.

573
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:37.910
Unattractive because I'd like to make sure that she's not attractive.

574
00:35:37.911 --> 00:35:42.330
She is attractive.
Oh yeah.
She's very well,
can we change that?
I don't think so.

575
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.500
I mean,

576
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:47.430
I could ask her to like shave her head or something like that before he make her

577
00:35:47.431 --> 00:35:51.570
do the skull.
It.
I don't know that I get that power,
but also just it,

578
00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.490
I'll suggest it what Jane,

579
00:35:53.491 --> 00:35:57.090
I'm very proud of you and I'm very happy for you and I know you've wanted this

580
00:35:57.091 --> 00:36:01.140
for so long and we've had so many successes on this.
And by the way,

581
00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:04.920
that is the thank you very much.
And I know you don't have much.

582
00:36:04.921 --> 00:36:06.060
I've wanted to do something like this.

583
00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:08.700
The other thing is that the next call I get is like,

584
00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:12.520
what are we gonna do about these dates?
So now I have to move dates,
you know,

585
00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:16.470
and it's,
it's one of the ones were trust me.
Um,
I don't like doing that,

586
00:36:16.471 --> 00:36:19.030
especially to people that are coming to see me.
I like,
I,

587
00:36:19.031 --> 00:36:24.031
I do super appreciate everybody's support in the live standup stuff,

588
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:29.910
but the way that these,
these things usually go is,
you know,
the movie takes,

589
00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:32.400
they own you for the time that they shoot.

590
00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:36.660
That's how the contract ends of dollars in production.
And Yeah,
not to me,

591
00:36:36.661 --> 00:36:40.230
believe me,
have not mark Wahlberg.
Yeah.
Yeah.

592
00:36:40.231 --> 00:36:42.750
I'm not making anything crazy on this.
It's so interesting.

593
00:36:42.751 --> 00:36:47.490
I was listening to Kathy Griffin and she was giving an interview about when,

594
00:36:47.491 --> 00:36:51.720
uh,
she was working on a Michael Jackson video as an extra back in the 80s.

595
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:57.230
And she said that Michael Jackson would just blow off going to sat and he and

596
00:36:57.271 --> 00:37:00.600
Macaulay Culkin would go to shopping at the mall.
Yeah.

597
00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:05.280
And she asked the director,
hey,
how much money is he blowing by doing that?

598
00:37:05.281 --> 00:37:05.641
And he goes,

599
00:37:05.641 --> 00:37:09.450
I'm million dollars a day and this is back in the entities by the way.

600
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:14.520
So there's a lot of money that goes into these films and to crazy music videos.

601
00:37:14.521 --> 00:37:14.701
It's,

602
00:37:14.701 --> 00:37:17.950
it's such a huge production that that kind of becomes the priority in Showbiz

603
00:37:17.951 --> 00:37:19.860
business and then everything else.
So look,

604
00:37:19.861 --> 00:37:24.240
I don't know if I'll ever book another job again.
Well,
I'm just saying,

605
00:37:24.241 --> 00:37:26.280
I mean it was 16 years for the first one,

606
00:37:26.281 --> 00:37:28.650
so I don't know if I'll ever booked another job again,

607
00:37:28.651 --> 00:37:32.040
but I'm going into this with like the attitude of like,

608
00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:35.940
I want to enjoy this experience.
Yeah.
Shooting a,

609
00:37:35.941 --> 00:37:40.920
a big movie I get to do.
Um,
I have like,
you know,

610
00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.730
some really funny lines.
I guess it's a fun character.
I get to play.

611
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:49.560
I'm playing in brother-in-law and who's basically kind of a loud mouth.

612
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:53.020
Don't say too much because I know I'm kind of this perfect.

613
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.300
Are you a piece of shit scum bag?
Cause I feel like no,
no,
no.

614
00:37:57.301 --> 00:38:01.080
I'm not a patient system.
I mean there's a bunch of makeup scene bloods,

615
00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:05.610
a shower scenes.
Uh Yeah.
Yes there are.
Yes there are.

616
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:11.190
Yes.
But I don't think so.
It's acting.
We Act.
We don't babe.
I just,

617
00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:15.180
I gave,
I come in,
I take,
I take a shower.
Uh,

618
00:38:15.181 --> 00:38:17.340
there's like a morning blowjob and then we go,

619
00:38:17.341 --> 00:38:22.080
we drive over and we see our relatives but that's just,

620
00:38:22.081 --> 00:38:26.700
I didn't write it.
Um,
talk to Sean.
All right,

621
00:38:26.701 --> 00:38:27.660
well I'll see my buddy.

622
00:38:27.661 --> 00:38:31.080
It's funny too that I'm going to see one of my old best friends,

623
00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:34.440
my old roommate lives in Atlanta with his family is all still see Justin.

624
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:36.790
That's good.
That's good.
You have a friend there in Atl.

625
00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:40.040
Even case was going to come down one weekend.
Good.

626
00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:45.640
Cause he's not too far and well,
it should be a great time,
you know?
Well,

627
00:38:45.641 --> 00:38:49.470
I'm going to miss you.
I'm gonna miss you too.
Baby jeans is getting miss you.

628
00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:52.660
You're going to be gone for like a mom.
A cut.
Well I'm a couple of weekends.

629
00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:55.750
I'm a fly home then a couple that I'm standing,

630
00:38:55.751 --> 00:38:57.820
I'm actually going to try to do stand up in the area.

631
00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:01.660
So look for an announcement of a,

632
00:39:01.661 --> 00:39:03.670
a couple shows in the,

633
00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:07.180
at least in the greater somewhere drivable to Atlanta.

634
00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:09.070
Now if you get a movie wife too,

635
00:39:09.071 --> 00:39:12.160
I get a temporary husband while you're gone or percent.
Yeah.

636
00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:14.440
Who Do I get to pick?

637
00:39:14.441 --> 00:39:19.030
Well you have to audition people the same way that I auditioned comics only.

638
00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:23.720
No,
I don't want them.
No comedian.
I'm,
I'm married to a comedian bay.

639
00:39:23.721 --> 00:39:28.330
Your your your scene partner is a comic actress.
Right.

640
00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:33.820
Okay.
God,
we're going to have so much fun,
but she stuck with it.

641
00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:38.650
What Babe?
What?
I've never shot these types of scenes.

642
00:39:38.651 --> 00:39:42.790
You know,
you're seeing of the boy.
Girls are seen work.
Tom,

643
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:48.300
how are you going to prepare for your ceiling roll boy method like Jim Carrey

644
00:39:48.401 --> 00:39:51.820
did and man on the moon.
Are you going to be one of those Douche bags?

645
00:39:51.821 --> 00:39:55.180
It's like I made character all the time.
Don't call me Tom.

646
00:39:55.181 --> 00:40:00.150
My character name is frank or whatever.
Anytime someone says Tom,
I'll be like,

647
00:40:00.151 --> 00:40:02.480
where?
Who are you talking to?
Who are you talking to?
Russ?

648
00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:07.140
I can't wait for you to become that kind of a movie star.
Yeah.

649
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:09.510
And Are you going to be,
yeah.

650
00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.520
Are you going to demand that people can't make eye contact with you on set?

651
00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:17.530
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Nobody look at me.
It's in my contract.
It's really,

652
00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:21.280
yeah.
No I'm,
I'm basically,
it's funny cause I'm going back to,

653
00:40:21.281 --> 00:40:26.281
I'm an open miker of on the acting the movie and the movie world.

654
00:40:26.921 --> 00:40:31.150
Yeah.
So I get,
I'm doing like introductory level everything,
which is great.

655
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:33.820
That's a great way to step into it.
Craft services,

656
00:40:33.821 --> 00:40:36.970
that means free food every day.
Onset can't beat that.

657
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.490
You can't go crazy cause I don't want to be all bart on it.
You know,

658
00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:43.930
you don't want to get burnt fat.
No.
God did you see him?
You know,

659
00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:48.670
shot a special,
which I heard was amaze.
Oh,
I heard the opposite.
Oh really?

660
00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:51.370
I heard that it went really well.

661
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:56.530
I heard it went really well from people in Philly.
And also you'd be surprised,

662
00:40:56.531 --> 00:41:01.120
but Burt himself actually said how amazing.
Yeah.
Not like him at all.

663
00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:04.930
It's as though he called over here the next morning and told us how great,

664
00:41:04.931 --> 00:41:07.840
how great it went and how was the best show of all time.
And I was like,

665
00:41:07.841 --> 00:41:11.960
this sounds very much like you.
So modest damper.
Like honestly,

666
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:14.023
I'm sure where

667
00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:19.360
he's so like quiet understated about stuff.

668
00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:24.760
And then I saw pictures of them.
Yeah,
it was bad.
No,

669
00:41:24.761 --> 00:41:27.640
I mean there's bodies so,
well that's what I'm saying.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

670
00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:31.450
Cause he did it shirtless for this special,
another shirtless special,

671
00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.950
which is so funny that there'll be

672
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:38.600
<v 4>two specials of him shirtless and you will just be like,
which one?</v>

673
00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.810
Like normally you'd be like,
Hey,
what's special are you talking about?

674
00:41:41.811 --> 00:41:43.860
And you'd be like,
oh,
the one where the guy's shirtless.
Yeah.

675
00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:46.310
Now they're gonna be like,
you know how that shirtless guy,

676
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:51.320
the one where he's a little less fat is the one I'm talking about.

677
00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:54.800
Can,
the neat part is that because that'll be his calling card.

678
00:41:54.801 --> 00:41:57.440
Like Larry the cable guy working can't a sleeveless.

679
00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:02.360
I hope it's the most special of all time.
Just so it solidifies that.

680
00:42:02.361 --> 00:42:03.194
He has to be sure.

681
00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.740
Because at that point if he walks around with a shirt somewhere,
people be like,

682
00:42:06.741 --> 00:42:08.840
you're being a dick.
Like just take your fucking shirt off.

683
00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:10.763
He's got to do it shortly.

684
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:14.450
And when he goes wherever and he's going to be like 80 years old,

685
00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:19.270
he's going to do he's shirtless course and let's be honest,
we're all gonna,

686
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:23.810
you know,
we work at trying to keep these shit bodies in some type of shape.

687
00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:27.200
He's going to fall off,
you know,
at some point in the next few years.

688
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:29.330
And like when he gets really fat again,

689
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:32.600
I can't wait to see him have to take this because it's actually,

690
00:42:32.601 --> 00:42:36.500
here's the thing,
it really is actually funnier to see him shirtless,

691
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:39.590
more out of shape.
So,
yeah,
that's Kinda the whole point,
right.

692
00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:43.340
To see him look like shit.
I hope he doesn't get in shape.
No,
I hope,

693
00:42:43.341 --> 00:42:44.174
I hope not either.

694
00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:48.860
Leanne Kreischer started her own podcast called wife of the party.

695
00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:51.170
It's a great name.
It's a great part.
It's a great name.

696
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:54.400
I listened to the first half of it.
She's doing,
um,
some special diets.

697
00:42:54.401 --> 00:42:57.070
She was talking about the beach body Diet.
I think it's called birds.
No,

698
00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:02.300
definitely not.
So that's,
you know,
anyway,
give Leanne's podcasts.
Uh,
uh,
listen.

699
00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:06.020
Yeah,
yeah.
She's a friend of ours,

700
00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:11.210
but a lot of stuff going on.
Yeah.

701
00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.450
A lot of stuff going on.
So we wrapped up our prisons show

702
00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:19.180
or maybe that was a throat throat come.

703
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:21.470
We wrapped up by her presence.

704
00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:26.480
She'll love after lock up and were devastated because that was the seventh and

705
00:43:27.501 --> 00:43:30.590
final episode last night.
Jean.
Yeah,

706
00:43:30.591 --> 00:43:35.540
that was a great short runs series.
I mean,
we talked about it for a while.

707
00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:41.210
Um,
but yeah,
it was,
I was sad that it came to an end,

708
00:43:41.211 --> 00:43:45.410
but I don't want to ruin it for people because I've ever since we brought it up,

709
00:43:45.411 --> 00:43:48.710
I got a lot of messages from people saying they're,
they're diving into it.
Oh.

710
00:43:48.711 --> 00:43:53.180
So let's not,
yeah.
But I mean,
now it's,
you know,
it's clearly it's made,
it's,

711
00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:56.390
it's over at this point.
You should have seen it if you're watching it.
Well,
no,

712
00:43:56.391 --> 00:44:01.370
cause that new episode,
the last one just dropped like,
right.
This episode is,
Oh,

713
00:44:01.371 --> 00:44:06.170
we're in the future.
Yeah.
Right.
Oh,
it's PR,
but it's,
it's alarming.

714
00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:11.000
Uh,
some of it is very sad.
Some of it is so upsetting to me,
especially the one,

715
00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:14.450
there's a mother of three children and just,

716
00:44:14.451 --> 00:44:15.920
I don't want to give it too much away,

717
00:44:15.921 --> 00:44:20.190
but she really fucks up her kids' lives for,
uh,

718
00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:24.670
the chance to marry this convicted felon.
It's pretty fucking amazing.
Yeah.

719
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:28.580
That,
and then I don't think there were too many surprises on that.

720
00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:32.400
I was surprised.
Oh,
ah,
no,
there is a which one,
which one?

721
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.140
White boy in Florida member.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

722
00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:41.190
It does not say it or no,
you know that in case people haven't seen it,

723
00:44:41.191 --> 00:44:42.270
you haven't seen it.
I don't know.

724
00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:46.890
But there's definitely a couple of surprises and then that's actually one where

725
00:44:46.891 --> 00:44:50.430
you go like,
oh,
that's good that,
that,
that the surprise happened.
Well,

726
00:44:50.431 --> 00:44:54.450
what's so funny is that you and I totally flipped.
So like at first we were like,

727
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:59.160
these prisoners are scumbags or taking advantage of these innocent people and

728
00:44:59.161 --> 00:45:02.720
now we're like,
these prisoners are just like nice people trying to,

729
00:45:02.721 --> 00:45:03.410
they're just trying to,

730
00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:08.280
our lives and these assholes on the outside are totally taking advantage of
them.

731
00:45:08.281 --> 00:45:11.820
And like they all get out,
these guys get out and the women are like,

732
00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:15.240
what are we getting married?
Why is there a big ceremony?
I want to wear my dress,

733
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:18.450
I want to have my bridal shower.
It's like,
dude,
he just got out of prison.

734
00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:21.870
He shell shocked.
He's traumatized.
He doesn't have a job.

735
00:45:21.871 --> 00:45:25.940
He slept in a check in with his parole officer like every hour,
you know,

736
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:29.380
he can't even leave La county.
Like,
why are you putting demands on it?

737
00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:30.480
With most of them.

738
00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:36.410
They'd been with the guy for awhile and they have so little compassion,

739
00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:41.390
understanding and empathy for their situation.
There was the outsider,

740
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:42.480
you're like,
how do you not,

741
00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:45.990
this guy's trying to adjust after six years in prison.

742
00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:49.530
Why aren't you having a little more like,
you can't see that.
Well,

743
00:45:49.531 --> 00:45:51.090
the Canadian guy especially,

744
00:45:51.091 --> 00:45:56.091
there's a couple in Toronto and the guy like clearly traumatized,

745
00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:01.260
looked like he may have been kidnapped,
beaten.

746
00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:06.750
He's total shell shock total.
The life has just drained from him.

747
00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:11.220
He's so bummed out and she's like,
I want to have our wedding

748
00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:17.910
Dobbs diamond shoes.
I want it to be,

749
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:23.360
it's my diet.
The best is like,
can we stop it and dude,

750
00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:25.940
Suntech Tuxedo shopping and he's like,
I can't actually,

751
00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:30.300
I got out of prison yesterday.
She's like,
yeah.
He's like,

752
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:35.070
I don't want really want to show up or Tuxedos,
right?
She was like,
why not?
No.

753
00:46:35.071 --> 00:46:37.200
She goes,
don't you left me?
I guess you don't love me.

754
00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:40.010
I guess I want to be my husband.
I'm like,
oh wow.
That's like too of what?

755
00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:41.070
You guys are crazy.

756
00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:44.450
The people that are dating these fools are crazier than the inmates.

757
00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:48.900
To her credit,
she's the one that when they do decide to just do it quickly,

758
00:46:48.901 --> 00:46:51.380
she's like,
you know all I really care about being married and she,

759
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:52.500
she's less about,

760
00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:55.740
oh I need the big thing that I actually just want to be married.
Yeah,

761
00:46:55.741 --> 00:46:58.550
she kinda got the priority of love.
Don't know.

762
00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:04.350
Then there's the lady on heroin.
That was awesome.
So I mean,
here's from,

763
00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.520
from what I've learned about present shows presence,

764
00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:12.330
not the place you get clean from heroin.
From what I understand,

765
00:47:12.331 --> 00:47:14.550
prison's not like a Malibu Rehab Clinic.

766
00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:19.800
It's kind of where you find new suppliers.
Like did drugs are still going on?

767
00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:24.360
Yeah.
You should start here in prison.
I'm not,

768
00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.300
I kind of want to get high all the time.

769
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:32.560
I would be dead if I were in prison from God.
Are you kidding me?
Yeah.

770
00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:35.590
I would be high all the time if I could be in jail.
Yeah.

771
00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:40.510
I would just be shooting scenes and shooting heroin at least pot.

772
00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:43.600
I try to be high on pot all day everyday if I could be.

773
00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:47.730
<v 0>I Dunno.
I would also,
it's funny that I think we talked about it,</v>

774
00:47:47.731 --> 00:47:52.550
but none of those people,
they all are just sad.
They just want to say,

775
00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:56.650
yeah,
they say just have their heartbroken.
You know,
too many times no.
Like

776
00:47:56.930 --> 00:47:58.740
<v 4>this person's in prison.
They can't hurt me.
Well,</v>

777
00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:02.990
and what's funny too is that a lot of these prisoners are just hustling.

778
00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:05.590
The people on the outside,
uh,

779
00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:08.840
there's this great guest of this woman.

780
00:48:08.841 --> 00:48:13.841
So there's this one woman who she's dating a guy in prison and she sends him

781
00:48:14.121 --> 00:48:16.760
$200 a month,
which for her,

782
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:19.460
she cannot afford $200 a month to send to.

783
00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:24.350
She's on such a tight budget that she only has $40 left at the end of every

784
00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:29.300
month for just like herself stuff.
The guy who from his photo,
you'd be like,
oh,

785
00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:32.850
this is a manipulator of psychopath for total scum.
Fuck yeah.

786
00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:34.470
And then her friend comes home,

787
00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:38.990
her friend comes over who's been in prison and she goes,
yeah,

788
00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:42.620
I used to scam like two guys at the same time because you want someone to tell

789
00:48:42.621 --> 00:48:46.520
you I'll take care of you.
I love and also to send you that money.

790
00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:51.200
That commissary money.
Yeah.
Cause they want their fucking snacks.
Core nuts.

791
00:48:51.201 --> 00:48:54.080
And there was definitely watch orange is the new black.

792
00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:56.600
What about these motherfuckers that don't have anyone to do that?

793
00:48:56.630 --> 00:49:00.260
They just don't have shit.
I mean that's gotta be,
how is that even fair?

794
00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:04.280
I think from what I know from orange is the new black.

795
00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:09.230
You can also work shitty prison jobs and make like 35 cents an hour and then

796
00:49:09.231 --> 00:49:14.120
that can go towards your commissary.
Hustlin there's such hookers,

797
00:49:14.121 --> 00:49:17.180
dude.
And then there's one fucking hooker who's hustling.

798
00:49:17.181 --> 00:49:21.500
The sweet truck driver on the outside bums me out the most.
She's like,

799
00:49:21.501 --> 00:49:25.350
don't you love me?
And once you pay my legal bills and he's like,

800
00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:29.440
you got caught with drugs and a phone.
They're saying eight to 12 years was like,

801
00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:30.323
oh,

802
00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:35.510
<v 0>I've got your back baby back.
He's pathetic.
He's,</v>

803
00:49:35.511 --> 00:49:38.190
he really is.
It's really sad.
Pathetic.

804
00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:44.110
Are you ready for perhaps the greatest thing a listener has ever done it to us?

805
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:49.930
<v 4>You talked about this at lunch before we sat down and record this.</v>

806
00:49:49.931 --> 00:49:53.350
I'm so excited.
I didn't expect it and that's just great.

807
00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:56.543
<v 10>Yeah.</v>

808
00:49:57.350 --> 00:50:01.070
<v 0>Here's the email.
Uh,
hey,
Tom and Jean for the last few days,</v>

809
00:50:01.071 --> 00:50:05.480
I've been having a blast calling people with the Christina soundboard I made.

810
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:08.810
Oh Shit.
I called random people named Jean and Tom,

811
00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:13.610
but this might be the best one.
Oh dear.
I told a phone,
sex operator.

812
00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:17.570
My name was Bert.
I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
Making it,

813
00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:22.970
keeping them high and tight.
Tony W.
Oh my goodness.
It's just,

814
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:25.800
it is a maze.

815
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:28.220
<v 4>You Ready?
I'm ready.</v>

816
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:32.020
<v 11>Here we go.
You've been talking about,
hello.
How are you?</v>

817
00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:38.470
It's good honey.
How are you?

818
00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:45.360
<v 12>I'm sitting here

Well,

00:51:03.451 --> 00:51:07.850

Scat play.
I know,
but I don't know.

824
00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:09.540
<v 12>I read where I want to put Christina.</v>

825
00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:14.240

That's the first time for everything,
Baby.

835
00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:10.920
It's too hard and is a little high.
But if you squat down,
it's all right.

836
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:15.410
I can do that whole job.
Thank you.

837
00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:18.290
<v 12>Wow.</v>

but this is so well done.
Well,</v>

841

851
00:53:20.490 --> 00:53:24.360
<v 4>I mean,

00:53:24.361 --> 00:53:28.470
hey,

Oh Wow.

854
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:37.030
<v 12>[inaudible]</v>

855
00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:46.180
<v 11>it's only smells
his lap.</v>

856
00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:51.130
<v 4>She likes it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean you really took a big,</v>

857
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:57.343
<v 11>yeah,</v>

858
00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:01.730
<v 4>he had to find like the perfect,</v>

859
00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:07.990
how does he do it in time?
I always worry he has the soundboard,
so,
yeah.

860
00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:14.733
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

861
00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:20.390
<v 4>That's such a throwaway.
Perfect.
Here we go.
Who's this?</v>

862
00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:24.590
<v 11>Hitler.
Hey,
I'd rather not talk about that</v>

863
00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:27.470
offensive.
Sorry.

864
00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:34.020
<v 4>Wow.
That's where she draws the line.
A Hitler.
Wow.
You said like,</v>

865
00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:37.080
Hi Hitler.
I'd rather than that.

866
00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:39.840
You probably have like a nice Jewish lady working in the front.

867
00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:45.500
<v 11>I don't Hitler.
Hey Hillary.
I'd rather not talk about that.</v>

868
00:54:50.410 --> 00:54:54.030
<v 4>Right back to shitting and she's fine with that,
right?
She's fine with that,</v>

869
00:54:54.031 --> 00:54:56.160
but not a,
not a little high.
Hitler.
Well,
I guess,

870
00:54:56.161 --> 00:55:00.840
I mean that kind of makes sense actually.
Does it?
I mean shit is shit,

871
00:55:00.841 --> 00:55:03.720
but like Hitler,
Hitler,
Nazi stuff.
Sure,
sure.

872
00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:08.860
Here she's had Nazi fantasies where the person's like,
call me Hitler.
Uh,
I dunno.

873
00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:10.080
Maybe she doesn't work those calls.

874
00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:14.150
<v 11>Hey Wipe,
wipe.
You make it look it up.</v>

875
00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:18.140
Smell it smells good.

876
00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:23.800
It's like I'm killing it.

877
00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:31.090
So you're always in an orgy.
Rob.
Rob,

878
00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:36.370
what's your pronoun?
I don't know.
What do you want it to be?

879
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:39.043
Kind of weird.

880
00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:48.930
<v 4>I like that.
She's like,
where's bird?</v>

881
00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:52.410
He's asking for him to step in.

882
00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:53.773
<v 11>Hmm?</v>

883
00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:04.310
Did you come hug somebody without their consent?

884
00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:09.810
We've opened up a whole other cannabis gets

885
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:12.910
to be done anymore.

886
00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:20.960
How do you decide what you do that day?
Go with,
do you feel like doing baby?

887
00:56:20.961 --> 00:56:23.120
Go with the flow.
It's silly.
Nazi.

888
00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:25.583
<v 12>Just go shit.</v>

889
00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:27.970
<v 11>I like the Shit,
don't you?</v>

890
00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:31.270
<v 12>Yeah,
I can tell you do.
Of course</v>

891
00:56:32.250 --> 00:56:35.780
<v 0>we call her for writing lab and at the,
are you kidding me?</v>

892
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.710
This woman's all pro.
Yeah.

893
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:41.140
<v 12>How do you guys deal with feelings?</v>

894
00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:43.790
<v 11>Oh,
for fuck feelings.
I'm over those.</v>

895
00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:50.920
I love to have with what you guys are smoking and tell you that much

896
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:53.480
<v 0>everywhere.
I feel like I peed all over the earth.</v>

897
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:54.660
<v 11>All over the world.</v>

898
00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:04.290
<v 0>Because you do sound like a total maniac or is he keeps bringing up.
She's like,</v>

899
00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:09.930
yeah,
but you're like,
yeah,
I gotta go pee everywhere whenever you want,

900
00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:11.400
but here's your goodbye.
Bye Bye.

901
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:14.940
<v 11>Dial it.
I gotta let you go.
You can call it back from what time is he liked?
Okay.</v>

902
00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:18.303
<v 12>Mine.</v>

903
00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:24.050
<v 0>You didn't even say Shit Shit.
Wow.
Wow.</v>

904
00:57:24.110 --> 00:57:26.540
That was really impressive.
That's like a lot of work

905
00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:34.140
and this is the right.

906
00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:36.640
<v 11>I'd rather not talk about it.</v>

907
00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:40.733
<v 13>Uh</v>

908
00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:42.900
<v 0>Oh my.
She really does go with the flow.</v>

909
00:57:42.901 --> 00:57:47.430
The only time she pushed back on us was with the Hitler,
which I,
like.
I said,

910
00:57:47.431 --> 00:57:51.210
I mean,
I just want us to loot Tony God damn telling me that's a lot of work,

911
00:57:51.211 --> 00:57:54.690
you know?
Sure.
Insulated stuff.
Made a soundboard then made a call,

912
00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:58.620
then found somebody to jump in and get involved in it.
It was really good.

913
00:57:58.710 --> 00:58:02.240
Really good.
Jamais yeah,
pretty amaze.
Wow.

914
00:58:02.310 --> 00:58:06.210
I have to admit it's a little weird to hear myself talking like that to a porno

915
00:58:06.211 --> 00:58:10.410
lady.
Are we not?
Whenever I leave a phone sex operator.
Yeah.

916
00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:13.650
How she's on an oldest shit by the way.
She'd been doing it for a minute.

917
00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:18.470
She's been doing it for awhile.
Yeah.
Well smoking to uh,
people,
uh,

918
00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:21.000
wrote in,
they said,
um,
mommies,

919
00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:24.390
I was minding my business last week Hoggins and balls and listening to the show

920
00:58:24.810 --> 00:58:28.050
when I was deeply disturbed by what I was hearing and there isn't much that gets

921
00:58:28.051 --> 00:58:32.640
my stomach turning,
but all the asshole rerouting talk got to me.
Oh,

922
00:58:32.641 --> 00:58:33.391
come on.
Wow.

923
00:58:33.391 --> 00:58:36.480
This is exactly the silly shit I come for when I get to my mommy's house.

924
00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:37.343
Next time.

925
00:58:37.410 --> 00:58:40.830
In the spirit of being sensitive to everyone's a false personal line of decency,

926
00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:45.210
just go ahead and piss on me and beat me.
Your friend Peyton Lafferty,
of course,

927
00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:47.510
this is not from last week,
but the week before,
this is uh,

928
00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:52.200
in reference to Johnny Pemberton discussing his colon being removed.

929
00:58:52.410 --> 00:58:52.831
Goodness.

930
00:58:52.831 --> 00:58:57.300
He had colitis and had to have his intestines rerouted and he had a colostomy

931
00:58:57.301 --> 00:59:01.740
bag.
And head is just,
man,
I thought it was just medically very interesting.

932
00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:04.910
It was very interesting,
but it was difficult to hear,

933
00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:08.250
to struggle with it.
I'm just so thankful.

934
00:59:08.251 --> 00:59:10.800
I've never had to deal with anything like that in my life.

935
00:59:10.830 --> 00:59:13.910
It makes me really thankful to when I was,
oh fuck.

936
00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:16.590
Just looking at him and he's like a teenager when it happens or something.
Right.

937
00:59:16.591 --> 00:59:20.790
Wasn't he like,
like 17 years old a man.
I know.
It's so,

938
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:25.400
<v 4>um,
somebody asks,
how much do painters,
right.
I knew we were going to get here.</v>

939
00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:29.990
I knew I wanted to go there after we did.
Boobies.
Yeah.

940
00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:32.420
You know,
twigging berries,
obviously,
you know,

941
00:59:32.421 --> 00:59:35.000
we're not talking about the same kinds of weight.
Not a lot.

942
00:59:35.001 --> 00:59:38.420
I can't imagine a time.
Let's start weighing dicks.

943
00:59:38.570 --> 00:59:42.680
You should also consider Tom having time where five pounds around his neck for a

944
00:59:42.681 --> 00:59:46.560
whole day.
Try it out.
One loan,
Matt,
for Chicago.
Of course.
Math,

945
00:59:46.561 --> 00:59:50.520
talking about what you're walking around with on that chest of yours.
Ooh.

946
00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:53.180
Oh my God.
I don't when the baby belly.

947
00:59:53.181 --> 00:59:57.950
So I've got a baby of a human growing inside of you coming front wise and then

948
00:59:57.951 --> 01:00:01.600
these teds.
Yeah,
it's fucking,
it's a lot dude.
But you know what?

949
01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.010
Doing [inaudible] just second time around has really,

950
01:00:04.011 --> 01:00:08.810
really helped because my core strength is a lot better now.
Yeah,
but man,

951
01:00:08.811 --> 01:00:11.840
like gravity wants you to be forward.
Pull you forward.
It's tough.

952
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:16.700
How's that baby feeling guys kicking around a lot.
He's doing really well.

953
01:00:16.701 --> 01:00:19.040
We're 20 weeks.
I'm halfway there.
Just crazy.

954
01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:21.300
<v 11>Like the shit down.</v>

955
01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:27.790
<v 4>Yeah.
Do you like to shit me?
Yeah.</v>

956
01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:32.380
It's all I talk about.
Yeah,
go lab but a brown talk.
If we may do a brown talk.

957
01:00:32.381 --> 01:00:36.160
Update,
update,
pregnancy,
Brown talk.
Pregnancy.
Brown's house.

958
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:38.640
<v 1>Oh</v>

959
01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:45.180
next door.
Brown.
Todd Brown.

960
01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:49.340
I got a fart.
Pretty bad.
I feel like.
Go for it.
Where's the Fart Mike?

961
01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:51.210
People are asking you about that.
I know

962
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:54.410
<v 4>we never came through on that.
Some people told me they were really disappointed.</v>

963
01:00:54.830 --> 01:00:58.010
I'm really disappointed.
Yeah,
we have extra mikes.

964
01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.390
<v 11>I love to have with you guys are smoking.</v>

965
01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:05.690
<v 4>We had extra Mike's laying around.
We have the lines.</v>

966
01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:09.590
Can we just have blue band put in a Fort Mike and we can sit it here in the

967
01:01:09.591 --> 01:01:11.260
middle and then when you've got one coming up,

968
01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:15.950
just might need to be on the ground and near your butthole and that's another

969
01:01:15.951 --> 01:01:19.300
arm we need to build.
Can we just put one here and then you just grab the farm?

970
01:01:19.301 --> 01:01:22.610
Mike,
that's a good idea.
It's not that hard guy,

971
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:27.270
but I do think I have to pause for a brown.
Yeah.
Are you being serious,

972
01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:31.580
serious thing?
I have to.
Okay.
What?
Do you remember what you were about to say?

973
01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:36.320
Of course.
We'll make note of it so that we can I go.
I'll go pee.

974
01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:40.190
All right.
I'm going to take a shit.
She's screaming.
Yeah,
that's going to be bad.

975
01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:44.460
Okay.
I can tell what's going to be really starting to be good.
All right.
Oh,

976
01:01:44.461 --> 01:01:48.590
how did that Brown go?
God,
it was very necessary.
What do you think it was?

977
01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:51.230
I don't know.
We had healthy lunch.
There wasn't a splatter,

978
01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:55.400
it wasn't a blaster or anything like that.
What was it like?

979
01:01:56.330 --> 01:02:00.020
I mean it was just ready to go,
but it was the one,
we have a number.
I mean,

980
01:02:00.021 --> 01:02:03.920
I think it was like a four and a half.
Oh,
okay.

981
01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:09.580
Almost a five.
Okay.
Interesting.
But the urgency was there.
Oh yeah,

982
01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:11.150
I was ready.
So,
um,

983
01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:14.750
what I was going to tell you about pregnancy poops is different because,
uh,

984
01:02:14.830 --> 01:02:19.160
as uterus,
your uterus grows and expands.
It squishes up your intestines.
Yeah.

985
01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:22.710
And progesterone increase makes you constipated,

986
01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:24.540
your digestion slows down.

987
01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:29.400
So now my poops were like rabbit turds and it can hit me at any time.

988
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:31.020
Like my schedule's all off.

989
01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:35.550
I really have to sit down and focus to make the Brown.
It's kind of a disaster.

990
01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:40.770
Wow.
I mean,
I should this morning,
but I just have to be really cognizant of like,

991
01:02:40.771 --> 01:02:43.470
when the urge strikes,
I gotta I just gotta honor it.
You know,

992
01:02:44.490 --> 01:02:47.490
you got to follow the,
yeah.

993
01:02:47.491 --> 01:02:50.670
It's just going to get harder from here on out to once the baby gets bigger and

994
01:02:50.671 --> 01:02:55.460
bigger,
doing a lot of this stuff by the way of what style?

995
01:02:55.550 --> 01:02:58.840
Multiple,
multiple browns all the time.
Well,
they're small.

996
01:02:58.990 --> 01:03:02.170
I sit down to Brown and that's like kibble.
It's like rabbit shit.

997
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:03.940
And then I just have to keep doing.

998
01:03:03.941 --> 01:03:06.640
I have to keep at it until you get something worth talking about.

999
01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:09.560
Would you like to,
I mean there's usually a push present,
you know.

1000
01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:12.440
Are you interested at all in this at all or no.

1001
01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:17.420
Bridget Boudreaux takes milestones and turns them into treasures.

1002
01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:19.580
Moms appreciate most

1003
01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:24.640
<v 14>breast milk is liquid gold.
Braswell is your diamond made from you?</v>

1004
01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:28.870
I cultured pearls out of your own breast milk and it's something that you cannot

1005
01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:29.743
buy off the shelf.

1006
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:34.010
<v 4>Do you think I'm going to pass?
I could reach out to her.</v>

1007
01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:37.070
Joe Breen mill charms.

1008
01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:38.020
<v 14>Joe From my son,</v>

1009
01:03:38.021 --> 01:03:42.300
Joey brief from Bridget came to be after the birth of her son Joey.

1010
01:03:42.310 --> 01:03:45.460
And when you breastfeed is something that you do all day and all night.

1011
01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:49.030
So I really wanted to commemorate the bond that that creates between only mother

1012
01:03:49.031 --> 01:03:49.864
and child.

1013
01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:53.590
<v 4>Mm.
So you have breast milk jewelry.
Um,</v>

1014
01:03:53.650 --> 01:03:55.270
I'd rather take like a diamond ring.

1015
01:03:57.790 --> 01:04:00.580
The breast looks more unique.
I don't want a breast milk ring.

1016
01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:03.100
I want a diamond ring.
I want to do the breast milk one.

1017
01:04:03.550 --> 01:04:05.980
A photo of it on Facebook got noticed.

1018
01:04:06.070 --> 01:04:09.760
Now orders are coming in from across the US.

1019
01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:12.710
<v 14>Every single piece is unique to them and their stories.</v>

1020
01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:16.430
I have made a memorial piece for a few babies that have passed.

1021
01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:20.330
<v 4>Wait a minute,
is she making it with her own breast milk?</v>

1022
01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:21.770
Are you sending in your breast milk?

1023
01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:25.940
I would imagine you're sending in your work though.
There's,

1024
01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:29.510
you're not just getting your,
now you got to ship it.
I understand.

1025
01:04:29.511 --> 01:04:33.590
And then she takes about three months for the stay at home mom to fill an order.

1026
01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:38.800
The customized charms costs between 50 and $200 500 moms ship their breast milk

1027
01:04:40.491 --> 01:04:43.010
to Bridgette last year.
Wow.

1028
01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:49.640
No,
now,
but this has to be a severe health hazard.
First of all,

1029
01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:53.900
you're not allowed to FedEx any fluids of any kind.
We know that.

1030
01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:58.880
So you cannot send your body fluids via the man.
Hundred moms just did.

1031
01:04:58.881 --> 01:05:01.160
You're not supposed to.
I'm pretty sure.
Yeah,

1032
01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:05.810
I'm pretty sure Fedex doesn't let you send Tj's or farts or whatever.

1033
01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:08.030
Breast milk.
Yeah.

1034
01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:10.890
<v 14>They'll never smelled bad.
Never Rot.</v>

1035
01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:14.460
<v 4>A mother of two turning a milestone for some women.</v>

1036
01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:18.490
This is the very last drop aggressive on if they have into a moment that can now

1037
01:05:18.491 --> 01:05:22.820
last.
A lifetime reporter is making this sound really serious.
Yeah.

1038
01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:26.380
And not,
not giving it the good natured ribbing it deserves

1039
01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:32.740
the last time.
And that's kind of symptomatic of our era that we're living in,

1040
01:05:32.741 --> 01:05:37.060
that everybody has to be honored and treated like it's rational,
insane.

1041
01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:42.070
And you can't call crazy people crazy anymore.
Right.
This budget and crazy.

1042
01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:46.070
She's honoring her breast milk,
right?
No,

1043
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:50.320
you can't just call people what they fucking are anymore.
God forbid,

1044
01:05:50.321 --> 01:05:55.030
was pretty crazy.
Gene,
is there anything else?
Well,
I mean,
uh,

1045
01:05:55.610 --> 01:06:00.490
I just want to talk about you being a Starbucks aficionado.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,

1046
01:06:00.491 --> 01:06:02.920
I,
you know,
I appreciate it.
Get you light up.

1047
01:06:03.790 --> 01:06:07.450
You're ready to tap out of this episode and I promise you that good service.

1048
01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:08.440
And that's the thing is,

1049
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:13.710
you know what I find that irritates me more than bad service of people who

1050
01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:19.140
justify bad service or who think that it's not worth pointing out that there's

1051
01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:22.920
bad service.
There's,
they're the worst people on earth and they're there.

1052
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.610
The reason why bad service continues because these people are like,

1053
01:06:28.090 --> 01:06:33.090
what's the big deal if somebody sucks at a job that you're paying for it,

1054
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:34.780
why don't you just let them suck?

1055
01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:39.640
Cause some people take pride in their job and should be celebrated.
Good Service.

1056
01:06:39.641 --> 01:06:42.070
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cause you go into some of these places,
not just start,

1057
01:06:42.071 --> 01:06:44.740
but I'm talking to any service place and you know,

1058
01:06:44.741 --> 01:06:48.100
it's awful and you're there just in a bad mood or they just don't care and

1059
01:06:48.101 --> 01:06:52.060
you're like,
this sucks.
Yeah.
I like to celebrate the ones where it's really good.

1060
01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.690
Don't you love it?
I think if you had ever,

1061
01:06:55.691 --> 01:06:58.900
if I was the person waiting on you at any of the numerous service jobs I'd had,

1062
01:06:58.901 --> 01:07:03.790
you would have hated me complaining.
Like I don't think,
man,
I complain to you.

1063
01:07:03.791 --> 01:07:06.040
I don't actually,
I don't call the manager over now.

1064
01:07:06.041 --> 01:07:10.000
I was a decent Barista and there may have been a decent server at times,

1065
01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:13.810
but overall I'd never cared.
I wasn't,
I'm not good at the service industry.

1066
01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:16.050
I like efficiency.
I like when they,

1067
01:07:16.090 --> 01:07:20.320
they don't have to know my name or any of that shit.
You like it?
Everybody does.

1068
01:07:20.350 --> 01:07:21.820
You said today you go,

1069
01:07:21.821 --> 01:07:25.530
we're going to go cause there's three Starbucks locations and are never had.
Yes.

1070
01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:29.590
And we did a run down of which one we should go to.
Well the,
the,

1071
01:07:29.650 --> 01:07:31.960
the one that we used to go to all the time that drive through one,

1072
01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:35.500
that one's not really good.
Why now?
Why is that?
I find them to be just fine.

1073
01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:38.540
Really fine.
They're inconsistent.
That's,

1074
01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:41.930
that's something that I realize is very nice in the server.

1075
01:07:41.931 --> 01:07:43.330
Consistent how with their,

1076
01:07:43.331 --> 01:07:47.030
how they treat you or the product products and sometimes they make it right.

1077
01:07:47.031 --> 01:07:49.180
So a lot of times they make it wrong.
It's pretty simple order.

1078
01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.690
They get it wrong a lot.
Um,
you know,

1079
01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:56.700
what is your order so that we will come back the layers pretty easy going ahead.

1080
01:07:56.770 --> 01:08:01.300
Venti,
iced coffee,
extra ice,
venti coffee would go ahead.

1081
01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:06.280
Ice,
venti coffee,
extra ice,
no sweetener.

1082
01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:09.640
Small Splash of whole milk.

1083
01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:14.620
And when you say a splash,
you do mean just a hint.
That's it.
Um,
yeah,

1084
01:08:14.650 --> 01:08:16.040
sometimes I'm in the store

1085
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:17.001
<v 0>and I'll say that.</v>

1086
01:08:17.001 --> 01:08:20.190
And then I watched the person take the milk and they go the blue two,
two,
two,

1087
01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:24.590
two,
two.
I'm like,
hey no,
that's not going to work.
What?

1088
01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:28.520
It's not going to work.
You just gave me a glass of milk.
Right.

1089
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:30.390
I don't want to drink a glass of milk.
That's yeah.
Yeah.

1090
01:08:30.391 --> 01:08:32.000
So I actually found a way around it though.

1091
01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:35.480
What's the way I asked for a whole milk on the side so I don't even have to put

1092
01:08:35.481 --> 01:08:37.910
it on the person anymore.
Okay.
I didn't realize you could do that.

1093
01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:43.240
<v 4>Cause I will say there nothing strikes terror in my heart more than how many get</v>

1094
01:08:43.241 --> 01:08:46.210
your ice coffee or iced venti coffee.
Yeah.
Uh,

1095
01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:49.600
because I know that I have to put that splash of whole milk and for you.
Yeah.

1096
01:08:49.930 --> 01:08:53.030
And if it's not the right color of blond,
yeah.

1097
01:08:53.050 --> 01:08:56.320
You get very upset.
Very.
And it's extra eyes.

1098
01:08:56.321 --> 01:09:00.040
If there's not enough ice in there and you get upset.
And I like,
I swear to God,

1099
01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:04.030
it induces a little bit of panic and anxiety in me.
No,
it does.
I'm sure.

1100
01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.670
Cause I don't want you to be unhappy.
I don't like that.
I'm not that.

1101
01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:09.340
I'm not that.
No,
you don't get mad.
But I know that it,

1102
01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.950
it disappoints you and I don't like to disappoint you.

1103
01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:14.590
<v 0>Sorry Sweetie.
You,
I don't feel like I'm that crazy about it,</v>

1104
01:09:14.591 --> 01:09:17.890
but I do like it mate.
You know,
you like your thing made the way you like it.
So,

1105
01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:20.620
but like I said,
I found that,
that I no longer ask for it.

1106
01:09:20.650 --> 01:09:23.490
I asked for now the whole milk on the side.
I go,
give me a little.

1107
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:24.110
<v 4>Sure.
So,</v>

1108
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:27.860
so the drive through one is you found that they're inferior in their consistency

1109
01:09:27.861 --> 01:09:31.940
and quality product.
Now the other location is in a very busy parking lot.

1110
01:09:31.941 --> 01:09:33.590
And what's wrong with that place?

1111
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:38.520
<v 0>It's too crazy.
It's chaos there.
The parking,
you mean the parking place itself?</v>

1112
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:41.190
It's very small.
It's,
it's tough now.

1113
01:09:41.191 --> 01:09:45.720
The one that's good also gets too busy so I will skip that one too.
Okay.

1114
01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:49.090
<v 4>But yeah,
that one's your favorite of the three locations.
Why?</v>

1115
01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:53.490
<v 0>No,
because it's good.
It's good service that has people in there are in a good,</v>

1116
01:09:53.491 --> 01:09:55.500
it just shows you,
it's like I'm not even asking for it.

1117
01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:59.910
People that work there in a good mood,
they're always pretty happy.

1118
01:09:59.911 --> 01:10:02.240
They treat everybody really well.
Uh,

1119
01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:06.300
they get really busy and they still maintain their composure.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1120
01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:08.030
I mean they're,
they're super nice.
Yeah.

1121
01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:10.780
<v 4>Well,
and you said that they know your name now and I know your drink.</v>

1122
01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.360
<v 0>Yeah.
Some of them do.</v>

1123
01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:16.020
Probably like half of them do and that you let it go there all the time,

1124
01:10:16.021 --> 01:10:19.140
but yeah,
but,
but you like that,
that they know you're sure,

1125
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:23.070
but like that's what anybody likes from a service.
Yeah.
You know,

1126
01:10:23.071 --> 01:10:26.580
is that the person they remember you,
they say your name,
they go,

1127
01:10:26.581 --> 01:10:28.260
I know that you like your thing like this.

1128
01:10:28.650 --> 01:10:30.510
It's like going to a restaurant where they go like,
oh,

1129
01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:33.340
you always get the ham and cheese or whatever.
Yeah.

1130
01:10:33.850 --> 01:10:37.990
<v 4>Well I think Starbucks is like in and out and that they take pride in training</v>

1131
01:10:37.991 --> 01:10:41.290
their employees very well.
They treat their employees very well.

1132
01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:45.010
They make sure the employees are aware of the products and what everything is

1133
01:10:45.011 --> 01:10:48.000
about and everything.
You don't sell them well.
You have a Starbucks knows.

1134
01:10:48.001 --> 01:10:51.670
Pick thanks.
Sell them.
We have a Starbucks employee who was like,
I don't know.

1135
01:10:52.090 --> 01:10:55.270
I don't know what that drink is.
I don't know what that Frappaccino is.

1136
01:10:55.271 --> 01:10:56.104
They fucking know.

1137
01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:00.800
<v 0>Yeah,
they're trained.
They're trained,
they're trained man.
They're good there.</v>

1138
01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:01.700
I love

1139
01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:05.360
<v 4>Starbucks.
I love it.
I know.
Fuck Pete's coffee.
I fucking hate it.</v>

1140
01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:08.510
It seems like the cost he nails.
I don't know.
I kind of,

1141
01:11:08.511 --> 01:11:11.540
I don't mind the coffee bean.
I don't like it.
I've I,
it's okay.

1142
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:13.830
I'll say this is mine.
They're trained well

1143
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:19.080
<v 0>and they,
the,
the employees actually are,
are usually really nice there.
Yeah,</v>

1144
01:11:19.081 --> 01:11:20.820
but I don't like their iced coffee and that's my drink.

1145
01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:24.060
I liked the vanilla latte.
I liked the vanilla powder.

1146
01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:27.300
Sometimes you get used to a certain taste.
You can't go away from it.

1147
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:29.880
So whenever I have an ice coffee with there,
I'm like,
ugh.

1148
01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:34.170
Some people hate Starbucks.
I know.
Burnt tasting.

1149
01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:40.110
Pete's just tastes like dirt down.
I don't like that.

1150
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:43.900
I had it the other day at the airport.
I want to throw up.
I don't like it at all.

1151
01:11:44.230 --> 01:11:47.050
All right.
Uh,
and Dunkin donuts can go fuck itself.

1152
01:11:48.230 --> 01:11:52.200
That is the worst water.
Terrible.
Yeah.
Gene,

1153
01:11:52.201 --> 01:11:55.650
this is a,
why am h dunkers by Dj?

1154
01:11:55.651 --> 01:11:59.340
Please come to Nashville.
Come back to Nashville for fuck sake.

1155
01:11:59.670 --> 01:12:03.180
That's the name of the Dj Nashville.
Oh,

1156
01:12:03.181 --> 01:12:06.960
and thanks to everybody ordering the,
uh,
not Los Angeles shirt.

1157
01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:12.060

1158

1159
01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.570

1160
01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:22.030

um,

1161
01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:23.190

1162
01:12:23.490 --> 01:12:27.820
Thanks again for listening and thanks for supporting our sponsors by gene.

1163
01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:33.040
<v 3>My head sizes like two chicken,
chicken,
chicken,</v>

1164
01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:37.450
chicken,
chicken.
Yeah,
that makes sense.

1165
01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:40.943
Big tits.

1166
01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:48.040
And after quadruple
drops out there,

1167
01:12:48.050 --> 01:12:48.883
that has sloppy,

1168
01:12:54.130 --> 01:12:56.690
sloppy,
sloppy,

1169
01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:00.630
sloppy jump,
jump,

1170
01:13:04.410 --> 01:13:08.180
big tits,
big,
big
drops out.

1171
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:09.790
Does that make sense?
