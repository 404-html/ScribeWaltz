00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.280
Well,
well,
well go to your mom's house,

2
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.413
Christina

3
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.260
<v 1>genes.
Are you ready to glass?
Just wow,
son.</v>

4
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.470
Ready to go glass in or what?
Cool.
So loose.

5
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.060
It makes me happy every time.

6
00:00:29.061 --> 00:00:33.670
I know it's the best every single single day too.

7
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.140
It's such a gift that I was testing out this new slack.
We have a,

8
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.190
you know,

9
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.090
new monitor and everything and I was just playing with it and we were running

10
00:00:43.091 --> 00:00:46.540
audio and video through it and we just use that clip and I just was laughing.

11
00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:50.110
Still a man still.
Yeah.
Yeah.

12
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.650
He gets so excited.
Were just glass,

13
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.070
glass and just glass.
So ridiculous.
All right,
let's start the show.

14
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.080
Um,
oh moose.
Do you want to start the show with a clip?
Oh No.
Uh,

15
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.550
holiday spirit or do you like Christmas spirit or do you want to do like a
silly,

16
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.690
silly man?
Well,
we did a silly man last week.
I'm going to do Christmas.

17
00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:20.600
And you love the Christmas season.
I love the holidays.
Yeah,
I do too.
Uh,

18
00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:22.600
I love the Christmas.
Uh,

19
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.200
and I don't want anybody with diamonds on the crevice of their person.
No,
no,
no,

20
00:01:26.201 --> 00:01:28.090
no.
So let's just go.
So gross.

21
00:01:28.091 --> 00:01:31.180
And I hate that you keep singing it around the house.
I know.
I know.

22
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.480
My asshole pucker every time.
All right,
let's do it.

23
00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:38.500
Let's start the show and it's clan.
That was good.
Let's get in the holiday.

24
00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:40.570
Christmas spirit.
Here we go.
Let's glass.

25
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.230
<v 2>Sure.
Close enough.</v>

26
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.583
<v 1>Ah,</v>

27
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.690
<v 0>don't bring in one month into this.
Well,</v>

28
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.060
we'll go to your mom's house.

29
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.040
Mom said Christina.

30
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.633
Okay.

31
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.080
<v 3>Yeah,
if I'm,</v>

32
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.970
<v 4>if that sounded weird to you.
It's should it did.</v>

33
00:03:05.971 --> 00:03:08.580
Because we have a replacement computer right now.
He goes,

34
00:03:08.581 --> 00:03:10.500
my logic board was fucked.

35
00:03:10.501 --> 00:03:14.190
Thank you for everybody that messaged me when I asked all those questions last

36
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.110
week,
my Mac book shot.
So that was so weird.
Yeah.
So I have a,

37
00:03:19.111 --> 00:03:23.350
I don't have like my normal drops.
I don't have my normal stuff yet.
So I did,

38
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.510
I realized I didn't have the intro.
So I had blue band record,

39
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.170
basically a version that's played somewhere,
but he doesn't have the actual file.

40
00:03:31.171 --> 00:03:34.860
Real deal.
Yeah.
So that's what we don't have all of our drops.
No,
but I have some.

41
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.240
But you know what that's gonna mean is that we have to invent new ones.
Oh yeah.

42
00:03:39.241 --> 00:03:40.620
Not only that,
but I do have,
I do,

43
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.290
it actually got me into something I'm really excited to do glass for,

44
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:48.870
of I'm in a glass all fucking day.
But the other thing I'm going to do is,

45
00:03:48.871 --> 00:03:52.830
um,
I went into the archives and you know,

46
00:03:52.831 --> 00:03:53.940
people don't realize,

47
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.970
I think we get 500 plus legit emails a week.

48
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.070
Yeah.
Wait,
I'm saying not,
you know,

49
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.500
people listening and writing in and you can only spend so much time,

50
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.770
you know,
looking over your job.

51
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.490
Basically we had to hire someone to do it and then the blue van has another gig

52
00:04:14.491 --> 00:04:16.810
too,
so he can only kind of get,

53
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.380
get through so much and prep all this stuff for the show.

54
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.270
So the other day when I,
when I sent in that computer to get fixed,

55
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.380
I'm using this one,

56
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.710
I went into the archives and I realize there's songs we've missed.
Yeah.

57
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.350
And then other times,
this thing,
we've talked about that before too,

58
00:04:34.351 --> 00:04:37.020
which is songs that have played,
but only once.

59
00:04:37.021 --> 00:04:40.320
And you're such a good fucking song.
They're so amazing.
Yeah.

60
00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:44.040
And they just come and go.
And we were so lucky that people send us amazing shit.

61
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.510
Yeah.
We only use,
can I ask you before I forget?
Yeah.
What are,
are these dicks?

62
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.020
Yeah,
there's decks on her tits,
so I can't leave looking at it.

63
00:04:52.021 --> 00:04:56.400
So for our listeners that,
um,
that don't watch the show,
we put,
you know,

64
00:04:56.401 --> 00:05:00.120
we try to put this up on,
on youtube every week.
Right now,

65
00:05:00.121 --> 00:05:04.480
the clip of the jingle bells lady,
she's um,
she has,
uh,

66
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.050
I guess like pink biker shorts,

67
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.280
but they're pulled up over her pretty sizable midsection.
Um,

68
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.990
Gut,
right?
I mean it's a pretty,
it's a who is she right there?
Yeah.

69
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.130
And then she has a hat on and um,
she,

70
00:05:20.131 --> 00:05:24.960
um,
I dunno,
uh,
a blue band said he,
he doesn't think she's,
well,
100%,

71
00:05:24.961 --> 00:05:29.670
but I don't know.
But then she cut out a paper,

72
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.310
drawings of Dicks and there are they,
what's the,

73
00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:37.500
what's used on her tits to keep them there?
It's like shaving cream.

74
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.580
So she rubbed shaving cream on her tits and then she put paper Dicks on them and

75
00:05:41.581 --> 00:05:46.540
then she sang Chicco Belson.
Well,
Django Bell,
it doesn't,

76
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.630
well she said jingle bells.
I think she's,
I think she's Spanish.
Yeah,
she's,

77
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.030
she's doing the best she can.
Yeah.
Let's see here.
Let's see.

78
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.320
Let's just got the spirit and she's touched.
Oh,

79
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.250
<v 2>that's a very Spanish,</v>

80
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.800
you know what's neat too is when

81
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.550
<v 1>do you want,
I really want to know</v>

82
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.960
which is this Christmas say no to Dick.
I think that's what she said.

83
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.760
<v 2>Love is when people do it in the bathroom.</v>

84
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.950
<v 1>That's what she said.</v>

85
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.950
It's nice when people do art in the bathroom by the toilet because the acoustics

86
00:06:45.051 --> 00:06:49.540
as you can here are fantastic.
The toilet and then it sounds good,
you know,

87
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.270
because of all the tile and I don't think she's that deliberate.
Yeah.

88
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.330
But what do you think inspired her to do this and why they,

89
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.550
I mean I understand jingle bells because she's obviously into the holiday,

90
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.310
but why this Christmas say no to Dick and Oh my God,

91
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.510
my thing just went to sleep again.
Why that you think?
Well,

92
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:12.470
she's got a dick problem.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
He's got a problem with Dick.

93
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.310
So you gotta say no today.
What is the problem she has?
You think she,

94
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.920
well she finds dicks on the Internet.
That's when I'm guessing.
Yeah.

95
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.430
And,
and they're probably not good dicks.

96
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.570
So wouldn't the solution be just go find better dicks?
You'd think that?
Yeah,

97
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.830
but she'd rather write a song about it and put it on the Internet.

98
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.790
It's so amazing to me that people still do this shit.

99
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.570
They don't even think about their families or jobs.
It's kind of on genes.

100
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.720
What do you mean what's going on?
Help me out man.
Keep talking.
Um,

101
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:44.803
I didn't realize

102
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.990
I have an interesting story.
I need your help with Tom.

103
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.560
I'm going to need you to pay attention to me eventually,
but I can set it up.

104
00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:59.170
Cause I've told you the premise already.
I went to Washington.
Dick come.
Yeah.

105
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.200
And how was that so much fun?
It's really fine.
Great clubs.

106
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:04.281
And be honest,

107
00:08:04.281 --> 00:08:08.990
I had such a hard time getting through my sets because the audience unanimously,

108
00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:11.450
they were all shouting your,
the water champion.

109
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.350
You're the water champion about me?
No,
no,
no.
Christina,

110
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:19.580
your the water and it was like distracted a bunch of losers went to your show.

111
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.880
No,
no,
they're all winners.
They're all mommies.
Um,

112
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.670
but I want to go over something that happened to me.

113
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.480
So I took a lot of sloppy dumps while I was on the road because we don't have

114
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:32.390
the,

115
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:37.130
the washlet there said this before sex the other night.

116
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:42.160
You're telling me about this,
about this lobby dump.
It really was gummy like,

117
00:08:42.161 --> 00:08:44.870
so I was like,
this is a sexy story.

118
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.530
Well that's why I wanted to bring it up on the show because we talked about this

119
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:50.630
last night before we did it.
They were really turned on.

120
00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:53.780
So I thought maybe turn on the audience.
So I,

121
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.840
during the day I was hanging out just glass and in my room and I had a fart that

122
00:08:59.941 --> 00:09:04.290
it was a hot fart,
but it didn't feel like anything came out.

123
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.610
But then I went to go pee later and I just like,

124
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:12.750
I went to kind of wipe it up down there and there was brown on the toilet paper.

125
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.810
So
was that a shark?

126
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:24.030
No,
I need help.
Was that a shark or was it just a little bit of leaky?

127
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:25.440
But you know what I'm saying?

128
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:30.360
You went to a p right and you wiped your badge.
Why wipe down?

129
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.410
You got to wipe down,
you wipe front to back.
And I do a thorough,
like

130
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.220
always fun.
Top down.

131
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.380
You always want to push the year end towards the Brown.

132
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.440
You never want to do the opposite.
Right.
He did that and there was brown,

133
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.830
but I was like,
I kind of grazed my be whole now.

134
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.820
I always do just to make sure nothing's going down there.

135
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.900
And there was brown on the toilet paper.
So that makes me think Tom was that,

136
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.750
was that a sharp?
Um,
I think you're the expert.

137
00:10:01.751 --> 00:10:04.130
It's quite obvious that you absolutely sharded.

138
00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.630
Do you remember the Fart that yes.

139
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:11.600
Did you have to have how soon before that p Wipe did you fart?
Well,
that's,

140
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.100
I was in bed and I was reading and it was like a hot fart.
Yeah,
it does.

141
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:18.860
I'm saying I didn't feel brown coming down.
I just felt like,
oh,

142
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:19.710
that was a hot one.

143
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.990
And then I went to go potty like 20 minutes later and there was a brown on the

144
00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:28.050
paper.
Wow.
But that other that,
but then I ha,

145
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:31.710
here's the other part that's telling me the other part and this is where I need

146
00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:34.620
help.
Yeah.
Because I took a really hot,

147
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.520
messy brown that morning because I had a hotel room,
coffee and I,

148
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:42.030
it was messy and sloppy and I had to go shit to shower on that one.

149
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:46.320
So my question to you is,
do you think that that was the neverending wipe,

150
00:10:46.321 --> 00:10:49.050
like a residual from my hot brown earlier?
Probably was.

151
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.200
You didn't mention that when you brought up,
did I shark?

152
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.130
Because if you just give me the information,

153
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.880
I farted and then I wiped when I peed and there was brown there.
You're shorted.

154
00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:00.900
But now you're telling me there's a big brown messy wipe earlier bus with messy

155
00:11:00.901 --> 00:11:04.160
brown.
Then it probably,
because I have those sometimes where you're like,
Ooh,

156
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.790
and then you go later on there's all this brown there.

157
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.860
But here's the thing is that I showered after and usually after I shower

158
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:16.680
thing you left out.
So now the first of all,
I'm really sexually aroused,

159
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:20.730
really turned the plot,
thickens the brown thing and well that's what I'm saying.

160
00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:24.840
I don't know.
What is it?
Was it a true shark?
Was it a post?

161
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:30.380
Uh,
you know,
leaky but situation,
I don't know.
Yeah,
it's,

162
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.090
it's really interesting.
Well,
it kind of sharp.
Tell me about sharks in your past.

163
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:39.200
Maybe I can compare a shark to just like I farted after a bad doubt basically in

164
00:11:39.391 --> 00:11:42.660
the,
maybe it pushed some more brownout oh,
sure it did.
I mean,
you know,

165
00:11:42.661 --> 00:11:46.230
a handful of times.
I'm trying to think of the most recent one.
Um,

166
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.260
but what's it like in your underwear?
Usually?

167
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:54.040
Usually a shark doesn't necessarily have to get that far because like

168
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.390
<v 4>your body alarms you so quickly.
It's like a,</v>

169
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.960
but clinch thing takes place.
You know,
you feel the brown coming down.
I mean you,

170
00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:04.120
you feel like,
whoops,
that's more than a fart.

171
00:12:04.121 --> 00:12:07.720
And it's like still in between your butt cheeks.
I've had one,

172
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:12.190
remember we got that,
I'm down in the South Bay that uh,

173
00:12:12.191 --> 00:12:17.020
it was like some green [inaudible] we're making those blender drinks.
Smoothies.

174
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.140
Yeah.
But it was like,
uh,

175
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:24.430
all it was called like ultra green or something green all day powder.

176
00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.350
<v 5>Yeah,
Dude.
That thing.</v>

177
00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.150
I remember that chart that was standing in the kitchen and I was like,
oh,

178
00:12:32.151 --> 00:12:36.410
here's a cool fart that was liquid though.
Everything came up,
felt it come out,

179
00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:39.860
which it completely soaked the back of the boxers.
Yeah.
Yeah.

180
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:44.270
But that was not,
I mean,
not your standard.

181
00:12:44.271 --> 00:12:47.090
I mean it's in the Shard scale for sure.
But it wasn't your standard one.

182
00:12:47.091 --> 00:12:50.420
That sounds to me.
Is that a shard or was that a shit?
No.

183
00:12:50.421 --> 00:12:53.530
Well that was what it was a short,
I mean I went to Fart,
right.

184
00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:58.280
And some shit liquid came out and that's kind of,
that's my point.

185
00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:03.380
I went to Fart and some,
a little brown came down and the Brown came out.
Yeah.

186
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.930
So that must be the Mai,
I'm,

187
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:08.180
I'm leaning towards a shark because we were so much time in between my shower

188
00:13:08.181 --> 00:13:10.970
and then that far that happened.
And then also that,

189
00:13:10.971 --> 00:13:14.510
that's my second sharp because the first one happened over when we were flying

190
00:13:14.511 --> 00:13:17.780
to Africa.
Remember when I showed up?
It's only the second of your life.

191
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:21.590
My life one have my life now.
Pros,
childbirth.

192
00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:25.310
That whole isn't,
is taught is it used to be.

193
00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.280
And I fart constantly.
I can't hold on a farm.
You mentioned that.
Yeah.

194
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.420
<v 4>And I've also noticed that and observed it and witnessed.</v>

195
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:37.210
<v 5>Sorry,
I farted a lot in public on this trip.
Like when I was on the airplane.</v>

196
00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:41.190
I just farted the entire time.
Yeah,
but don't you fart on airplanes?

197
00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:46.030
A art?
Don't you fart?
Like Cree Fart,
right?

198
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:51.190
Pound farts.
Yeah,
of course.
Well,
cause nobody can hear it.
Oh of course.

199
00:13:51.191 --> 00:13:54.970
Yes.
A R t.
Now I have another addendum to this topic.

200
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.630
I farted on the plane.
Have you ever had a fart?

201
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:02.440
And I think your dad just brought this up recently that didn't even smell like

202
00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:06.750
your own.
So you kind of question like,
is that my Farnam smelling or somebody

203
00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.750
<v 4>houses?
Yeah.
Yeah,
we did talk about that.</v>

204
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:15.190
My Dad was saying that he's discovered a new farts.
No.
Right.

205
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.500
What I had was that I flew a few weeks ago,

206
00:14:17.501 --> 00:14:22.260
it was when I flew to Philly and somebody was ripping big farts.
Yeah.

207
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:26.440
And continuous where I was like,
fuck,
it was the same smell.
And you're like,

208
00:14:26.441 --> 00:14:30.160
God dammit.
And then about three and a half hours into the flight,

209
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.710
I farted and my fart smelled like that.
Right.

210
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.400
<v 5>That's so cool.
That was weird.
No.
Do you think it,</v>

211
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.690
did you guys eat at the same place in the airport?
Maybe.
I don't know man.
I mean,

212
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:44.280
I guess it's possible.
Anything's possible.
It's magic.
I Dunno.
Fart Moses.
Yeah.

213
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:45.810
Wow.
Yeah.

214
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.020
<v 4>Speaking of,
by the way,</v>

215
00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:52.400
that's Elizabeth May and you remember that?
Uh,

216
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:57.430
<v 1>we have a r t a few weeks ago we played her,</v>

217
00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.770
um,
let's see.
I'm sorry,
that was me bits.
What happened?

218
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:05.870
I moved and she got startled and bark.
Oh yeah.
She gets it very scared.

219
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:09.860
So a few weeks ago we played her,
she's The lady who in parliament was like,

220
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.300
you shouldn't say fart.
Remember?
Um,
excuse me.

221
00:15:14.301 --> 00:15:17.450
But I don't think she's very courtly to say parliamentary.

222
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:21.960
<v 6>Well the government talking about skilled labor.
Yeah.
Michelle,</v>

223
00:15:21.961 --> 00:15:25.140
why is it the infrastructure minister talking about how to implement

224
00:15:25.141 --> 00:15:29.370
infrastructure yeah.
To work in Alberta.
Yeah.

225
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:32.880
Why does this government treat Alberta like a fart in the room?

226
00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.850
Nobody wants to talk about or acknowledge.
Oh,

227
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:39.270
I thought I made that happen because we both did that.

228
00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:44.100
That guys was trying to hold back the laugh part and the wind honorable member

229
00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:48.900
for a Senate.
Chuck,
I'll filings your rough,
my friend and her speech.

230
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.370
But I heard her to say a word that I know is distinctly on parliamentary.

231
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:55.920
I think she may want to withdraw.

232
00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.680
Bird was f a r t tattletale

233
00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.200
<v 1>per title tail.
Right.
No Fun.</v>

234
00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.800
No one likes you and nobody likes you.
Elizabeth

235
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:09.400
at the,
um,
I forget what it's called,

236
00:16:09.401 --> 00:16:13.240
but it's like the equivalent in Canada of the correspondents' dinner,
right?

237
00:16:13.241 --> 00:16:15.160
Like the Canadian,
yeah.
Yeah.

238
00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:20.380
So we're members of government and journalists are together and it's,

239
00:16:20.381 --> 00:16:22.960
you know,
it's a little bit looser night,
but she,

240
00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:28.180
she appeared to be hammered at the scene and was escorted off.

241
00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:30.780
<v 6>So we showed you last week,
God is here.</v>

242
00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:33.840
I want to mention we stand on his traditional territory too.

243
00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:37.030
And I want to say like,
what the fuck was wrong with the rest of you?

244
00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.540
You didn't notice where standing on traditional territory,

245
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:44.910
what doesn't scream out first nations about this stage?
No,

246
00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.910
she's bombing,
bombing.
And then here later,

247
00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:50.910
unusual by you're speechless.

248
00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:57.150
Look at her being escorted off.
Got More class in my whole fucking cabinet.

249
00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.740
Thank you.
Wow.

250
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.880
<v 1>And uh,
that lady,
this lady looks mortified.</v>

251
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.460
She was playing a song from her cell phone.

252
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:10.680
She was so drunk.
So then,
um,
you know,
we made it a big thing.

253
00:17:10.681 --> 00:17:15.681
Obviously we played it on this show a lot and then we were sent in her

254
00:17:15.871 --> 00:17:18.600
appearance after that.
Yeah.

255
00:17:18.601 --> 00:17:23.100
So after that she made it to jeans.
Uh,

256
00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:25.770
all the news shows in Canada.

257
00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:30.360
Now we've been talking about this all morning about comments from you by the

258
00:17:30.361 --> 00:17:33.720
thousands.
As a matter of fact.
And we want to hear this lady,

259
00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:36.300
she is in Ottawa.

260
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:42.120
May thank you for being our guest.
Weirdo.

261
00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.120
Her teeth.
Wait,
she's got the perfect smile.

262
00:17:45.121 --> 00:17:49.110
It looks like a perfect smile isn't really,
but it's,
it looks like she,

263
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.070
she puts it in like

264
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.720
<v 6>you do.
Like it's Kinda halfing dude.</v>

265
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:56.250
Oh well her smile is not perfectly level apologize.

266
00:17:56.251 --> 00:17:59.700
I know in interviews with other news organizations this morning,

267
00:17:59.701 --> 00:18:01.960
having perhaps seen the video again,
a,

268
00:18:01.961 --> 00:18:04.800
any comments you would like to make additionally?
Well,

269
00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:09.690
just to make sure that viewers know that what I was attempting to do was to,

270
00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.810
as you do at the press gallery dinners,
and I know all journalists know it.

271
00:18:12.811 --> 00:18:14.160
I don't know how Canadians know it.

272
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:19.640
That'd be annual press gallery dinner is an attempt at humor and often playing

273
00:18:19.861 --> 00:18:23.520
against oneself in ways that are self deprecating and doing things you normally

274
00:18:23.521 --> 00:18:24.354
wouldn't do.

275
00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.420
<v 1>So he,
you know,
what sucks about that is that it's a,
um,</v>

276
00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:32.570
she's making an apology.
Non-Apology it's,
I'm sorry.
No,
I'm not sorry.

277
00:18:32.571 --> 00:18:35.570
I didn't do anything wrong,
but I'm here to do this.
It's the worst man.

278
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:40.100
You know what?
You know what the right answer is.
The right answer is I'm,
yeah.

279
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:43.820
You know what?
I had a few too many bombed.
That was terrible.

280
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:48.220
Just why can't you just admitted it was,
uh,
it was,
uh,

281
00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:52.250
it was a night of fun times and I went a little too far.
I got hammered.

282
00:18:52.251 --> 00:18:57.080
Sorry guys.
Have you ever had a drink too many or is everyone here above that?

283
00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.550
<v 6>Right.
Various stick.
Sometimes sticks.</v>

284
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.190
They fail and mine did not work at all.

285
00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.890
It's tempting humor and failed.

286
00:19:05.891 --> 00:19:09.910
I take full responsibility and I certainly course,
yeah,
well that's good.

287
00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:14.070
She needs a lozenge.
She did that there.
She said she did take responsibility.

288
00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:18.080
She goes,
I tried.
It wasn't my intention ever do,
uh,

289
00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.460
just the jet to Canadians that I was making a speech.

290
00:19:21.461 --> 00:19:24.250
I was trying and obviously failing badly.

291
00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:28.900
I delivering something new purse.
Had I hindsight,

292
00:19:28.901 --> 00:19:33.070
I should've realized that having traveled so much to the previous 48 hours that

293
00:19:33.071 --> 00:19:37.890
I was probably too sleep deprived.
Pull it off again.

294
00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:43.460
<v 1>Uh,
to me,
didn't seem tired.</v>

295
00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.430
Pretty alert.
Pretty,
pretty groggy.

296
00:19:46.431 --> 00:19:51.431
Maybe seem like you might have been down for a for a long fun night ahead of

297
00:19:51.831 --> 00:19:55.850
you.
Yeah.
She needs to get those bottom teeth fixed to match the top,

298
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:57.230
the bottom turn yellow.

299
00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.550
Really wondering.
I mean,
yes it was the parliamentary.

300
00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.040
Rudy's are and he can afford nice teeth.

301
00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:11.810
Him and the guy that wrote Downton Abbey,
that Guy Julian Fellowes,

302
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.790
Julian Fellowes as a horrible bottom row,

303
00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:17.853
<v 6>I</v>

304
00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:24.160
allow the stairs as we walk the hell put live in there downstairs.

305
00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:29.030
Now you see here that you would never rest your back against the chair and beat

306
00:20:29.031 --> 00:20:31.330
them time.
It's a melon spoon.

307
00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:35.880
Is hourly both scoping as all are?
Yes.

308
00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:38.290
It's a different animal,
but you're still in front of your peers.

309
00:20:38.291 --> 00:20:41.660
You're still making public comments.
You know,
there's still,
people have phones,

310
00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.850
chill,
you know,
all of that.
So,
so what happened?
I got wasted.

311
00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.980
Just what?
I

312
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.800
<v 4>was so tired.
I was so tired.</v>

313
00:20:50.801 --> 00:20:55.510
My tits almost fell off when people are go to rehab for exhaustion and our

314
00:20:55.511 --> 00:20:59.410
business like,
oh really?
I actually think that could be real though.
Exhaustion.

315
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.840
It's called throw gas I think and mental illness.

316
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:06.190
I think if you were to do like the more I've toward when it gets back to back to

317
00:21:06.191 --> 00:21:10.180
back nights I could see you going needing like to check out.
Yeah,

318
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:13.270
but don't you just stay home for a month?
Like that's the thing.
Is it at home?

319
00:21:13.271 --> 00:21:17.410
You still have shipped pulling at you mental hospital?
I don't know.

320
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:21.100
I've never had it but I'm saying I could see how if somebody said we're checking

321
00:21:21.101 --> 00:21:24.260
you into a facility to not think about stuff for,

322
00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.970
I don't think there are a facility that's like the four seasons,

323
00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.690
but that's what they do is they go check,
they check in somewhere for exhaustion.

324
00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:36.130
It's a mental health facility,
but I'm saying I could see how that happens.

325
00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:40.330
I can see I have a too,
but it's usually because it's coupled I think with drugs,

326
00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.930
throw gas and mental illness.
I don't think it's just like you're tired.

327
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:45.370
I think it's more,

328
00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:50.400
but I think at that level of work load where you're traveling that much like day

329
00:21:51.161 --> 00:21:53.530
to day to day and performing and like have,

330
00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:58.860
I think you could be drug free mentally ill free and have it happen.

331
00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:00.760
I do think it's both.
Where are you going?

332
00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.330
You go to a mental hospital because you're,
you're well,
yeah,

333
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:08.230
because your mental state isn't well,
but you're not mentally ill.

334
00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:12.310
You just have worked herself into a state of literal exhaustion.

335
00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:16.930
It was code for,
I have a drug problem.
I need to go and get help.

336
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:18.070
I'm not disagreeing with you.

337
00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:23.100
My say my thing now is that I actually think no did I think it's real.

338
00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:27.870
I think it's actually legit.
Not drug related.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I get exhaustions.

339
00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.310
There you go.
Go check in today.

340
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:30.950
<v 6>Hold.</v>

341
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:35.450
Having a one night that I could do something edgy and humorous given that I am

342
00:22:35.451 --> 00:22:38.270
in parliament,
the person knowing over the last four years,

343
00:22:38.271 --> 00:22:42.140
my record in parliament,
what I've tried to pacify our teeth.
I never hackle.

344
00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.930
I never swear.
I'm respectful to everybody.

345
00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:48.350
I've got the idea that has a skit material.

346
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:51.830
It would actually be funny if I was different from how I really,
nobody cares.

347
00:22:51.831 --> 00:22:56.030
That obviously doesn't work right.
Really giving the explanation,

348
00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:59.500
but she thinks that people know her well enough,
like you know what I mean?
Like

349
00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:03.030
<v 4>maybe they're,
they do Elizabeth.
So special.
Maybe there are.
They do you have a,</v>

350
00:23:03.031 --> 00:23:07.460
she ain't shit.
She ate her.
She ate her Ted's.
So they don't know her that well.

351
00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:08.290
I guess not.

352
00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:11.980
<v 6>I Ha I have to ask because many of our viewers have commented after seeing the</v>

353
00:23:11.981 --> 00:23:15.490
video through this morning.
Was alcohol involved?
I don't think so,

354
00:23:15.491 --> 00:23:19.450
but I think I was very sleep deprived and I'd worked at 21 hours a day.

355
00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.630
Excuses for myself.
I should not.
In hindsight,

356
00:23:22.631 --> 00:23:27.470
I've thought I was capable of pulling off and edgy because she drank fresca.

357
00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:31.660
No,
I don't think so as I drank,
but I don't think it affected,
it affected me,

358
00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:34.840
which it did.
And they did serve wine with dinner and not denying that.

359
00:23:34.841 --> 00:23:36.400
But I think primarily,

360
00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:39.670
I mean it was just whatever wine the waiter served at our table.

361
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.860
I hadn't been too much for over.
I don't think that was a factor,

362
00:23:44.861 --> 00:23:47.300
but obviously that's what people are saying on online.

363
00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:52.720
<v 1>And then she's like,
I'm going to,
I'm going to omit that.
I,
I,
um,
I had six.</v>

364
00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:57.040
Yeah.
And then I had that Xanax before the parties.
Xanax.
Yeah.
And uh,

365
00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:00.250
I'll just be like,
is it one is the one that everyone else drink?

366
00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.560
Did I have special one?
Was there another glass?

367
00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:06.840
Did they give me an extra fucking,
I don't think so.
I had a bread roll,
I think.

368
00:24:06.841 --> 00:24:11.230
Um,
she gave such a politician's answer like,
Jesus Christ just go.
Yeah.
Yeah.

369
00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.870
I know.
I remember what she did at least owned.
She was like,

370
00:24:13.871 --> 00:24:15.250
I was trying to be funny and I just hate shit.

371
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:18.720
It wasn't Barack the one of the first people to dairy.
Yeah.

372
00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.210
I remember when Barry was like,
yeah,
I smoked pot.
Yeah.
I inhaled,
yeah.

373
00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.540
Next question.
No,
it's so much better it to somebody just like,

374
00:24:25.541 --> 00:24:30.100
I smoked cigarettes,
so I love cigarettes.
That was kind of story.
He was like,

375
00:24:30.101 --> 00:24:33.700
that was the hard thing for him to stop doing smoking.
Yeah.
He stopped smoking.

376
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.830
I think he smoked even into the beginning of the presidency.
So Rad.
And then,

377
00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:43.120
you know,
they were like,
you can't be the president,
but he's in great shape.

378
00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:47.170
Yeah.
I mean physically he's physically fit dude.
Yeah.
He's in Trudeau shape man.

379
00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:51.550
Yeah.
What do you think's been better shaped rock or two dads?
Trudeau.
Yeah,

380
00:24:51.551 --> 00:24:54.230
he's younger too.
Yeah,
he's younger.
How old buried?
You know,

381
00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:58.240
Barry's got to be probably at this point right around 50,
I think.

382
00:24:58.241 --> 00:25:01.570
Late forties early.
Sure.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
No,
I think you turned 50 and office,

383
00:25:01.571 --> 00:25:05.620
so yeah,
he's probably 50,
51 young president.
Yeah,

384
00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:08.020
I'm a old orange sauce.
He's uh,

385
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:13.000
he's 70 so here he looks every year.

386
00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.580
Yeah.
It looks like shit

387
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:19.400
<v 6>politician,
not a comedian.
And that went really badly.
Okay.</v>

388
00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:24.610
<v 1>There you go.
Well,
she did.
She did actually do well.
We,
um,
yeah,</v>

389
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:27.390
we demanded as people you don't represent,

390
00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:29.430
we demanded that you apologize that way.

391
00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:33.340
I need to tell her what to do with her life.
Yeah.
I just,
you know,

392
00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.600
you need to get a perfect smile,
Elizabeth.
We should send her one.

393
00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:39.600
Can we find out where did we can send her mail and parliament.
Yeah,

394
00:25:39.601 --> 00:25:42.600
that's too bad or smells really bad.
Really bad.

395
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.760
You know what the blood flow of the perfect smile is.
They only cover the top.
Oh,

396
00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:52.440
if it's the perfect smile,
it should also be the bottoms.
Yeah,
that's true.
Um,

397
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:55.860
I got it.
I had an idea to try this week and one want to know what it is.
Yeah.

398
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.270
When you hear

399
00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:05.310
it means that we're going to do our,

400
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:07.530
um,
our

401
00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.820
<v 7>plugs then or travel blogs.</v>

402
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:16.100
So that's what,
that's the code for you like,
yeah.

403
00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.940
<v 1>So just real quick,
we'll do it fast.
Um,</v>

404
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:26.470
I don't know if there's any left,
but I'm at the Ice House.

405
00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:31.030
Uh,
actually this is after that.
Sorry.
It's this already that already came out.

406
00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:34.780
New Year's Eve.
I'm in Orlando,
Florida Horn it up.

407
00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.980
Five shows.
Um,
29,
30,

408
00:26:38.981 --> 00:26:43.950
31 new years eve is a special event.
Just a FYI.
It's always going to cost more

409
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:48.810
<v 4>than,
than any other night of standup comedy at the comedy club.
Um,</v>

410
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:53.970
but then I go to Kansas City,
Kansas Shitty.
Um,

411
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.870
and I'm going to be there doing my thing and stuff like that at the Improv,

412
00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.250

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:03.900
Then Oxford ox hard in the Ventura county at that levity live,

414

This is the stage name Max Newman who we were talking about.
He,

554
00:39:08.101 --> 00:39:10.530
I think if I played this once,
um,
when I,

555
00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:14.890
when I was on Rogan I was telling him about problems make by Dick soft.
Yeah.

556
00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:17.100
And how I wanted to make that a song.
Yeah.

557
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:22.240
So then he made a song right out of me talking about that.
Wow.

My Dad's coming.
He's one year old.

625
00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:20.260
So crazy.
Some people say one years old.
I know.
It's not plural.

626
00:45:20.330 --> 00:45:24.330
One year old.
Yeah,
no,
a lot of dumb people say one years old now.

627
00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:29.280
Stupid's it'll officially make them a toddler,
right?
I think so.

628
00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.480
I think once I start walking,
they're considered toddlers.

629
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:34.960
What about this person do you think?
Do you think this person is also,

630
00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:37.440
<v 14>hi everybody.
Hi</v>

640
00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:26.970

<v 1>He's real serious about it.
Well I from Santo Domingo,</v>

642
00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:38.000
Dominican Republic.
Hey,
I loved the yard.

643
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:41.270
That's where we saw a hardcore pornography in our hotel room.

644
00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.000
Remember that was the best hotel are we ever stayed at?

645
00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.130
I wish we would watch so much more.

646
00:46:46.131 --> 00:46:50.840
I was like ready to like just do that for a few days.
That was so funny.

647
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:55.440
Hardcore pornography or hotel channel 69 too.
So weird.

648
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:58.220
I remember at the end we took a survey and then they said,

649
00:46:58.221 --> 00:46:59.270
what was your favorite channel?

650
00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:04.280
And I put 69 with a winky face or the free pornography.
So weird to say.

651
00:47:04.281 --> 00:47:07.230
What was your favorite channel?
It was on the survey.

652
00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:10.280
Remember they don't think like Americans.
You know what I'm saying?

653
00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:14.720
Did you have a favorite channel while you were here?
Okay.

654
00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:30.000
<v 14>Amen.
Amen.</v>

655
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:35.420
<v 5>He's really sick of got that disease.
Yeah.
People are that.
What if,
what</v>

656
00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:38.590
<v 4>if next week it's uh,</v>

657
00:47:38.591 --> 00:47:43.591
our son's birthday party and we give them the cake and he makes his wish and we

658
00:47:45.671 --> 00:47:50.200
say happy birthday.
And the first thing that pops out of his mouth is,

659
00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:52.290
<v 5>I am Nigga.</v>

660
00:47:56.250 --> 00:48:01.050
I be like,
you are your father's son.
A baby.
That'd be so fun.

661
00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:04.620
You know what?
I'm actually a little,
if you said I'm not a baby,
be a,
I'd be,

662
00:48:04.621 --> 00:48:08.310
that'd be hilarious.
Yeah.
Like I'm a little concerned because

663
00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:12.623
of the,

664
00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:17.070
the aggressive farting and burping that you and I do in front of him.

665
00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:19.470
Now he's starting to understand a lot of this stuff.

666
00:48:19.471 --> 00:48:23.400
He understands everything that you say.
Yeah.
He can't really talk back.

667
00:48:23.401 --> 00:48:27.380
But like we have the fart chair in the morning that you've been sending on.
Yeah.

668
00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:32.310
And that it's going to be a problem.
Our son's going to have problems.
Yeah.

669
00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:40.290
I
don't think he's not going to be doing that.

670
00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:42.690
That's going to be his future wife.
Yeah.
And that's going to be like,

671
00:48:42.691 --> 00:48:46.980
he'll be making videos like,
hey was here,
got another big burp coming up

672
00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:52.370
king ass rapper as a child.
Yeah,
but,
but can I tell you,

673
00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:56.340
I'd rather have him data girl.
It can do this.
Yeah.
And some dumb dumb.

674
00:48:56.890 --> 00:49:00.870
Some girl who's like uptight and lame.
Well,
what kind of girls up type in lane.

675
00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:03.240
Girls don't rip 'em like that.
Yeah.

676
00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:06.480
I want him to date the kind of girl who's like,
I have come all over my face.

677
00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:14.280
Come on.
My
God,
I hated that lady.

678
00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:18.120
I remember when the guy called me gene,
that was so great.

679
00:49:18.121 --> 00:49:22.170
He didn't look professional at pluralize.
Jane Jane has everything.
All right.

680
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:24.730
And you didn't correct him.
That was my favorite.
If I was like,

681
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:28.980
it's jeans Polero sir
diffused,

682
00:49:29.370 --> 00:49:33.310
but he also would have been,
oh,
I'm,
I'm sorry Jean.
Yeah,
Jean.

683
00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:38.660
<v 4>Uh,

somebody else sent,
um,

684
00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:43.550
<v 5>Really.
I love these.
Yeah.
Thanks.
[inaudible] me.
See if I can get jeans forward.</v>

685
00:49:43.551 --> 00:49:45.440
This thanks genes.
Thanks Mommy.

686
00:49:45.590 --> 00:49:49.250
Can I tell you another thing that we were talking about at breakfast this

687
00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:50.510
morning?
Because Ellis is one,

688
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:55.490
almost one year old now and he can finally kind of feed himself.
Like he'll,

689
00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:59.180
he'll pick up whatever you put on his little tray and like mash it into his

690
00:49:59.181 --> 00:50:02.270
mouth.
Yeah.
And I remember your sister Maria,

691
00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:07.190
when Weston was about,
I dunno,
six months old.
Yeah.

692
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:09.800
We were like,
oh,
is he eating solid?
She goes,
yeah.

693

He's top dog is adorable.
He's going to love the baby of that.

720
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:56.090
You know what I love about your dad is that he has no problem chillin.

721
00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:58.520
Your Dad is the chill.
It's like he'll come,
I can,

722
00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:02.760
I know now they're going to come from the airport and then chills like too hard.

723
00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:05.520
Too hard.
I'll come,
I'll come in for five minutes,
be like,
all right,

724
00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:07.850
let's go back to hotel.
And that's how,
by the way,

725
00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:11.210
that's how you know I've done a couple of father son drips with him and he wants

726
00:52:11.211 --> 00:52:11.670
to do,
he's,

727
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:14.410
he was wanting to do one this year and I actually regret that I didn't,

728
00:52:14.411 --> 00:52:17.810
and he wants to do one next year.
And I'm like,
yeah,
of course we'll,
we'll do a,

729
00:52:17.811 --> 00:52:22.790
we'll do one.
So he,
um,
he goes like,

730
00:52:22.810 --> 00:52:26.090
we go on trips and we get there and he's like,
check in,
you know,

731
00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:27.860
you get something to eat and you're like,
okay.

732
00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:32.210
And then you go and as you're eating he'll be like,
let's go back to hotel chill.

733
00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:35.960
And I'm like,
okay,
I'm gonna get there.

734
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:39.950
And then we're like in bed,
like,
you know,
we're like sharing a room.

735
00:52:39.951 --> 00:52:44.300
He's in one bed and [inaudible] good time.
Right?
I got it.
Yeah.

736
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:47.260
And then he's like,
wait,
I gotta get dinner somewhere.

737
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:50.270
I don't go to go see some shit or something.
We do that and then it's like,

738
00:52:50.271 --> 00:52:53.710
let's go back and chill again if we look to do,
that's what I like to do.
Yeah.

739
00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:55.310
I mean,
I mean,
I guess I kinda like to do it too,

740
00:52:55.311 --> 00:52:56.750
but he's like an extreme version.

741
00:52:56.751 --> 00:53:01.751
I think the only bummer part about having a kid for me.

742
00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:05.820
Yeah,
no chill time.
And for me,
I'm,

743
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:07.670
I'm as lazy as your dad.
Actually,

744
00:53:07.671 --> 00:53:12.671
my natural state is reclining constantly and I really liked that about him.

745
00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:17.240
Yeah.
He likes,
by the way,
you've picked up the habit of I'm done eating.

746
00:53:17.241 --> 00:53:19.760
I'm going to go.
Oh really?
And you get up and you leave.

747
00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:23.180
Remember we were eating dinner last week and he,
first of all,

748
00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:27.510
there's no talking now when you eat,
it's like silence.
I have to talk to Ellis.

749
00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:30.730
Yeah,
he doesn't talk back.
Yeah,
you just,
it's silence.

750
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:39.200
What does silence and then you get up and you clear your plate.

751
00:53:39.481 --> 00:53:42.690
And I'm like,
Tom,
we're not done yet.
And Alice and I are still sitting here.

752
00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:47.520
Then what did I do?
You fart.
No,
I stayed.
Right.
Cause then you go,
oh yeah,
sorry.

753
00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:52.650
Yeah.
Wow.
Wow.
You hear that one?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I Dunno man.

754
00:53:52.651 --> 00:53:56.820
I'm sorry.
Yeah,
sorry.
Yeah,
it's going to get worse obviously.
Oh,
I know.

755
00:53:57.510 --> 00:54:01.790
We become our parents.
It's inevitable.
I know.
Signed up for this shit.
Boy.

756
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:06.330
You think I fucking love this shirt?
This might be my favorite,
favorite,

757
00:54:06.331 --> 00:54:10.770
favorite ever.
Ever.
Ever.
I want one so bad.
Okay,

758
00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:14.880
well they're going to messenger one over today,
right?
I'm getting one over here.

759
00:54:14.881 --> 00:54:18.630
I'll have another one ship to you.
Um,
oh my God.
I love it.

760
00:54:18.631 --> 00:54:22.700
It's such a good design,
Anthony,
uh,

761
00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:24.540
merchant method who we work with,

762
00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:30.300
glass glass.
It's so silly.
It's so good.

763
00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:38.370
It's so good for the hardcore fans going to cry

764
00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.910
and the audience in DC.

765
00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:45.750
My favorite thing was to see everybody's shirts like it.

766
00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:48.570
And you could see it from the beginning of why I made sure there was an old

767
00:54:48.571 --> 00:54:52.740
school top dog shirt.
There was some Theo shirts there.

768
00:54:52.741 --> 00:54:56.100
Was You with cane?
Yeah.
It's so rad.
Like to look out.

769
00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:58.720
It's like a catalog of all the memories of the show.

770
00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:03.840
Kind of connect with somebody.
You're good.

771
00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:10.410
So we're really excited.
It's the just glass and shirt order now.

772
00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:13.000
Try to get it in time for Christmas.
Just glass.

773
00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:18.230
So stupid.
Yeah.

774
00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:21.220
He's super stupid.
Sounds

775
00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:29.030
so stupid.
We made sweet love.
Yeah.

776
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:32.970
And you showered beforehand.
I thought that was really when you stop with that.

777
00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:37.380
What are you talking about?
When you brush your teeth every day?

778
00:55:37.381 --> 00:55:41.730
What are you talking about?
All the time.
Yes.
I do.
No nonsense.

779
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:45.450
Not before we make sweet love,
which this would have played after we had sex.

780
00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:46.740
You just get caught up in.

781
00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:51.600
That would have been cool.

782
00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:57.960
Just glass and um,
I really love this shirt.
Yeah,
that's great.

783
00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:04.110
Go to Tom [inaudible] dot com click on the store and it'll take you to our,
our,

784
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:08.130
our merge page.
Or would you rather you do,
I don't have,
would you rather music,

785
00:56:08.131 --> 00:56:12.960
but give it to me.
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Okay.
I came up with it today.

786
00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:14.580
Okay.
Okay.

787
00:56:14.581 --> 00:56:19.581
Would you rather make browns without the use of the toto washlet three 50 e

788
00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:24.460
yeah.
Forever.

789
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:25.833
<v 4>Or</v>

790
00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:29.530
<v 5>not be able to floss.
Ooh,
forever.</v>

791
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:33.820
Wow.
You have to choose between going back to taking Moshi bear dumps.

792
00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:37.690
We're going back to being the disgusting animal who doesn't floss.

793
00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:42.060
<v 4>I would take no more flossing.
Wow.
Yeah.</v>

794
00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:45.510
Walk me through the logic.
Well,
I'm thinking of,
first of all,
first of all,

795
00:56:45.511 --> 00:56:50.511
how much I enjoy the toto washlet three 53 50 e and all of its magnificence and,

796
00:56:51.501 --> 00:56:56.501
and just unbelievable technology and I love the clean feeling of a post Brown

797
00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:02.720
<v 5>washlet.
I know.
It's like impossible to go back.
You can't go back in time.
Yeah.</v>

798
00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:04.630
<v 4>Um,
there's,</v>

799
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:09.160
there's times where I've wanted to floss whatever,
don't floss.

800
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:12.940
You just don't floss and you're like,
fuck,
this is whatever.
But you have gross.

801
00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:18.010
It's gross.
But you go,
I dunno,
you,
you know,
you,
you still can rinse your mouth.

802
00:57:18.011 --> 00:57:21.610
You brush your teeth,
you,
you could get a Waterpik,

803
00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:24.640
you could do all these things that are kind of,

804
00:57:24.810 --> 00:57:26.700
<v 5>well let's do this.
Let's take out the Waterpik.</v>

805
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:28.670
You can't do that because that's a form of flossing.

806
00:57:28.770 --> 00:57:31.020
<v 4>Okay,
well I think you could still,</v>

807
00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:34.740
you could be really more thorough about you're brushing.

808
00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:36.270
You could do more thorough.

809
00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:40.470
<v 5>It's not,
it's not the same but your,
that's something away.
But it's like,</v>

810
00:57:40.471 --> 00:57:44.100
do I want to floss and then have that dirty birdie bottle all the time.

811
00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:46.590
And I think the answer is no.
Well,

812
00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:51.620
here's the thing is that I would choose not having the toto washlet three 50.

813
00:57:52.401 --> 00:57:55.380
He only,
because I just go shit to shower anyways.

814
00:57:55.381 --> 00:57:57.960
Like I feel like that's always been my toto washlet sure.

815
00:57:58.110 --> 00:58:00.660
But not flossing.
Like,

816
00:58:00.661 --> 00:58:04.770
you know how it is after you eat a steak and there's just chunks of meat in
your,

817
00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:09.030
between your teeth.
There's nothing grocer.
It's disgusting.
It's disgusting.

818
00:58:09.031 --> 00:58:12.690
And if you can't like brushing doesn't always get those chunks of food out.

819
00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:15.780
I know you have to floss.
Yeah,

820
00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:20.540
<v 4>pretty fucking gross to not floss,
but it's just the way it is,
man.
I'm going to,</v>

821
00:58:20.550 --> 00:58:25.020
I'm choosing it's a would you rather,
I know,
I know what were opposed on this?

822
00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:29.100
Yeah.
You would take no more brown so no more clean browns.
No,

823
00:58:29.101 --> 00:58:32.550
I would just go straight to the shower like I always did before the toto,

824
00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:35.610
that was kind of your,
that was kind of,
I feel like there was a,

825
00:58:35.611 --> 00:58:40.020
would you rather that I really liked there was you sent it to me.
Really?
Yeah.

826
00:58:40.050 --> 00:58:44.190
I'll you want me to find it?
Yeah.
Okay.
Just talk for a while.
I'll find it.
Okay.

827
00:58:46.170 --> 00:58:50.220
What just Todd for awhile.
Yeah.
Sometimes you guys send really good ones.

828
00:58:50.221 --> 00:58:55.170
So I um,
uh,
let me see,
is this the one?
That's it.
What'd you rather,

829
00:58:55.710 --> 00:59:00.580
nope,
that's not it.
But I know there was a good one.
Good one.

830
00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:05.160
And you go,
oh,
this one's great.
Let's read it.
If you can find it.
There it is.

831
00:59:05.370 --> 00:59:09.590
Okay.
Ready?
Go for it.
How is that?
La La,
la La.
Oh,

832
00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:12.030
okay.
Okay.

833
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:14.400
<v 5>You are stuck in a small queen bed,</v>

834
00:59:14.401 --> 00:59:19.401
motel six hotel room for 30 days with either king ass ripper or John Soccer's

835
00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:22.280
full on carrying

836
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:25.390
<v 1>out their famous antics.
Okay.
Pause right there.
Yes.</v>

837
00:59:25.391 --> 00:59:29.390
We inform people kicking ass rapper who normally I would play a drop of his,

838
00:59:29.391 --> 00:59:31.550
the Fart God.
Uh,
he makes the,

839
00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:36.150
the fart videos in his tighty whities and he just lays in bed.

840
00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:43.540
It gives the double thumbs ups as he lets out like these crazy long farts and

841
00:59:43.671 --> 00:59:47.480
he's got like Brown stains and his underwear and it's horrific.
Right?

842
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:52.870
John's soccer's Vegan enthusiast who makes songs about veganism and he has the

843
00:59:55.580 --> 01:00:00.080
Deacon Vagina and how he,
he makes,
you know,
ridiculous songs,

844
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:03.090
comedy songs,
all about veganism.
And He's told,

845
01:00:03.091 --> 01:00:06.650
he made a video where he wants to eat every woman's vagina if they're Vegan.
Oh,

846
01:00:06.651 --> 01:00:10.800
so stupid.
Um,
okay,
so that's just a set up.
So they are,
there's those two.

847
01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:11.870
You share a bed with them,

848
01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:17.120
have no contact with the outside world and no form of entertainment other than

849
01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:20.630
whatever you and your person of choice choose to do for fun.

850
01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:25.580
John Soccer's is allowed to bring an acoustic guitar for him.
Oh my God.

851
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.520
The king can bring one extra pair of clean underwear.

852
01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:33.170
Food and drink are unlimited,
but you must follow their diet choices.
Exactly.

853
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:37.750
Which will be delivered through a tray slot.
So I was to avoid outside context,

854
01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:43.280
whatever they choose to eat,
you eat,
who becomes your 30 day roommate.

855
01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:47.030
I hope contemplating this fantastic choice makes you reveal those million dollar

856
01:00:47.031 --> 01:00:51.520
smiles.
I appreciatively Steven.
Right.
Thank you.
Steven Wright,

857
01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:55.550
the comedian.
Famous comedian.
Right.
Thank you for listening.
Um,
uh,

858
01:00:55.560 --> 01:01:00.350
I think that's a really good,
would you rather it got me to thinking personally.

859
01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:05.570
I like king ass rubber more.
There's no,
there's no question for me.

860
01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:06.673
Oh No.

861
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:11.950
But 30 days locked in a room that is disgusting to be with him.

862
01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:17.480
It's vile.
It's,
it's revolting.
And I'm going to go with Sean,
John Soccer's,

863
01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:22.340
oh my God.
And here's why.
Annoying.
Oh my God.

864
01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:27.370
It not as bad as revolting and I feel like he would annoy me.

865
01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.870
There's on some level he would,
um,
you know,

866
01:01:29.871 --> 01:01:33.530
he knows so much about veganism that he would educate me and I'd be like,

867
01:01:33.531 --> 01:01:36.940
all right,
I'll learn about this.
Yeah.
But I'll learn.
So I'll be like,
all right,

868
01:01:36.941 --> 01:01:38.240
I'll learn.
Um,

869
01:01:38.330 --> 01:01:41.510
I would end up probably wanting to write a song with him so I wouldn't be like,

870
01:01:41.511 --> 01:01:46.350
oh this is third.
Get out some creative juices,
have some fun.
Um,

871
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:50.450
eat healthier.
He's going to feed me his diet so I'm going to eat healthier.

872
01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:53.810
So it's going to be a healthier 30 months,
30 days.
Um,

873
01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:58.760
if you live with king,
asked ripper for 30 days,

874
01:01:58.790 --> 01:02:02.180
it would be KFC,
baked beans,
fear.

875
01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:07.340
He would fart all day everyday to the point where they're going to be probably

876
01:02:07.341 --> 01:02:11.090
shit cause he,
he does Brian,
he sharks like you did all day.

877
01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:16.160
It's going to smell like fucking hell in that room.
It,
it's going to be taught.

878
01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:20.220
It's not 12 hours.
Listen,
it's only 30 days of your life.
So 30

879
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:24.810
<v 5>day it's a month you eat poorly for nobody else will eat eggs.</v>

880
01:02:24.811 --> 01:02:27.960
Don't forget,
he likes to eat dude.
He farts on them first.

881
01:02:27.961 --> 01:02:30.870
He's going to Fart on your food.
He's in charge of the food.
I know so,

882
01:02:30.871 --> 01:02:32.100
but here's the thing,
John Soccer is,

883
01:02:32.101 --> 01:02:34.740
we'll try to lick my vegan vagina the whole time.
You know Vegan,

884
01:02:34.741 --> 01:02:37.410
he'd be disgusted by you.
Yeah,
but I'm disgusted by him.

885
01:02:37.411 --> 01:02:40.590
At least king as ripper is not a sexual fucking predator.

886
01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:45.330
John Soccer's is too sexual for me and it would creep me out and he would try to

887
01:02:45.331 --> 01:02:46.164
hit on me the whole time.

888
01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:51.300
King Astra has no interest in women as is obvious because he puts out fart

889
01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:52.700
videos and burp videos.

890
01:02:52.701 --> 01:02:56.400
I think you're so far off on this one has no interest in me sexually and that

891
01:02:56.401 --> 01:03:01.401
would be the main reason I'd go with King ash of her and I like farts and burps.

892
01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:05.820
I laugh at them a lot.
Yeah,
but you open a window.

893
01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:08.850
What do you think my life with you is like?
It's not that far off.

894
01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:11.980
You think I'm on king after uppers level you please.

895
01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:17.420
There are some days you're almost as bad as aspirin.
Yes dude,

896
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:22.430
there's one but Ali and okay there's one and yes,

897
01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:27.720
you put that Goddamn fan next to our bed so you fart into the fear hasn't been

898
01:03:27.721 --> 01:03:30.750
on since we've been here.
And then the fan blows the fart in my face.

899
01:03:30.751 --> 01:03:35.340
You've been doing that for years.
I am.
I am used to this fan on tonight.

900
01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:38.940
I am learning this to this art torture and tonight f a r.

901
01:03:38.941 --> 01:03:43.941
T I'm used to this kind of behavior to me that will be like you in tidy whities

902
01:03:44.521 --> 01:03:49.260
from Oh thank you,
your honor.
Come here.
Let me tickling like that guy.

903
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:54.000
<v 4>I love that guy.
I hate him.
I think he's awesome.
Uh,</v>

904
01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:57.450
so nasty talk last week we played that for a,

905
01:03:57.451 --> 01:04:01.770
I think his name is Orlando is articulate it this way.

906
01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:05.860
Know what?
I don't like it.
I got new stuff for you.
I took it that way

907
01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:12.480
in that diamond is always a plus a bitch.
Oh my God.
I like him.

908
01:04:12.850 --> 01:04:17.110
<v 5>Diamonds in the crab is per se.
So</v>

909
01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:22.010
<v 4>turns out we were like,
Oh,
who is this guy?
And he's a a known guy.</v>

910
01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:24.890
Yeah,
he was on,
that's so raven,

911
01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:28.430
which is so that's so raven.

912
01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:32.120
Orlando Brown is his name.
Uh,
he did Vlad TV and interview.

913
01:04:32.121 --> 01:04:37.121
So check out the diamonds in the crevice of your pussy guy giving an interview.

914
01:04:37.450 --> 01:04:41.180
I'm like,
God will speak in it.
Speaking of Raven and Mickey Mouse,

915
01:04:41.181 --> 01:04:44.230
you had that line and no fear.
Yeah.
Yeah.

916
01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:47.070
<v 15>You know a lot of them talking about so many months,</v>

917
01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:49.590
so many miles to suck my suck.
Like Raven did what?
She was black.

918
01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:53.000
When you hear that rat a tat,
I suggest you Nigga Scott.
Oh yeah.

919
01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:54.690
Well I mean just that.

920
01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:59.020
<v 4>Oh yeah.
Wow.
That's pretty good.
What do you mean to say?</v>

921
01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:01.000
Like Raven did when she was black?

922
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:04.840
<v 15>I mean,
I told you in the first interview,
I mean,
she gave me</v>

923
01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:10.790
and I gave her some,
but I do,

924
01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:13.080
I do.

925
01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:18.180
<v 5>Yay.
Yeah.
Oh Wow.
So</v>

926
01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:23.250
<v 1>he's saying that he ate ravens box.
Yeah,
she's pretty,</v>

927
01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:25.150
yeah.
There's no reason.
There's nothing weird about that.

928
01:05:25.330 --> 01:05:27.440
I'm just saying he has an interesting way of showing it.

929
01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:30.730
So interesting is that you and I have been going to tender Greens lately.

930
01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:34.110
That's become our jam.
Yeah.
Yeah.

931
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:36.250
God bless tender Greens.

932
01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:40.540
You and I are huge fans and lately we've been seeing people with throat tattoos

933
01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:43.240
a lot and he's got,
it's a good move.

934
01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:48.690
I think if you're looking to put yourself into a,

935
01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:49.220
uh,

936
01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:54.010
a cat and a unique category where there's opportunity,

937
01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:59.020
there's um,
originality,
there's no,
no threat,

938
01:05:59.650 --> 01:06:03.940
perceived threat of your behavior.
It's the um,

939
01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:08.260
it's the choice to get a throat peace and good for customer service.

940
01:06:08.830 --> 01:06:11.680
Absolutely.
When you walked to the register,
yeah,

941
01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:17.080
we went to our tender Greens and this really cute 20 something year old girl.

942
01:06:17.081 --> 01:06:21.510
Super Nice.
I mean super sweet,
but it's an aggressive,
uh,

943
01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:25.510
it was a cat right on her throat,
like a big one too.

944
01:06:25.511 --> 01:06:27.520
And I imagine when she envisioned it,

945
01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:29.950
it probably didn't feel that severe in her mind.

946
01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:35.410
And then when you get like a black cat,
it's pretty severe.
It's really,

947
01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:38.650
she was like five feet tall,
so tiny,
tiny.

948
01:06:38.651 --> 01:06:40.900
She was like her head down looking at the register.

949
01:06:40.901 --> 01:06:42.760
Then it looks up and you're like,
oh my God.

950
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:48.820
And there's another tender Greens employee that has a throat tattoo as well.

951
01:06:48.821 --> 01:06:51.390
There was to throw tats are aggressive.

952
01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.640
I don't know what it is about tender Greens,

953
01:06:54.641 --> 01:06:58.180
but they're employees are covered in an aggressive tattoos.

954
01:06:58.570 --> 01:07:02.420
Not that I don't oppose it.
I think it's entertaining.
I know,

955
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:05.530
but I'm not so sure that's where you want to go as a business model.

956
01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:09.730
You know you got family people coming in there and not everybody is as open to

957
01:07:09.731 --> 01:07:14.330
the throat tattoo as you and I are.
No,
it does limit your job choice.

958
01:07:14.350 --> 01:07:17.140
What do you mean you're worried?
Tender Greens

959
01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:22.390
that you work at attach shop.
Yeah,
the job stoppers.
Right?

960
01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:23.920
Your work at a knife store.

961
01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:30.690
There's tender Greens,
the knife store,
pet store maybe.

962
01:07:30.691 --> 01:07:33.940
I think you want to stay away.
I've always,
you know,
retail is hard.

963
01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:38.620
I think face is not the best idea.
And then I also want to throw in throat.

964
01:07:39.830 --> 01:07:44.620
Yeah,
I think it's an addendum to the face tattoo that you had.
Yeah.

965
01:07:44.621 --> 01:07:48.850
Clearly either your Mike Tyson and that's it with the face tattoo.

966
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:51.220
Very few people can pull those off.
Very,

967
01:07:51.221 --> 01:07:55.940
very few and by a few I think we mean one.
So yeah,

968
01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:56.340
it's,

969
01:07:56.340 --> 01:08:01.340
it's always a long or would you rather get the throat cool tattoo of the cat?

970
01:08:03.371 --> 01:08:08.371
Like the one that that girl or you get the Tyson and it's as an homage to him

971
01:08:08.741 --> 01:08:10.820
and people know that you and he are acquaintances.

972
01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:14.800
That's a little much on the fan blowing out to be like,
Hey,
I got a tattoo.

973
01:08:14.801 --> 01:08:15.910
Like did it on my face.

974
01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:19.880
Like here's my thinking is that if you were to do the face tattoo and people

975
01:08:19.881 --> 01:08:21.590
know it already,
they would go,
oh,

976
01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:25.820
Tom Segura loves Mike Tyson so much that he did an oh my gosh,
he's crazy.

977
01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:27.590
He's mentally,

978
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:30.590
but you're going to get that anyways for the throat tat don't you think?
Yeah.

979
01:08:31.630 --> 01:08:36.440
That's really scary to see.
I think,
um,
I think it went with face.
They go like,

980
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:37.850
okay,
I know what I'm dealing with here.

981
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:40.910
And I think when someone sees that throat tattoo,
they're like,

982
01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:43.410
what am I dealing with?
Right.
That's when you level,

983
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:46.760
because I feel like the throat tad is dot.
Yeah.
It's like,

984
01:08:46.761 --> 01:08:51.440
it's gotta hurt so bad.
So tender the,
yeah.

985
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:54.440
Yeah.
Um,
and then just,
and then she has a,

986
01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:58.720
she had a filled in black cat.
Yeah.
So there's color in that thing.

987
01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:04.070
He goes over and over and just what's up,
bro.
Yeah.

988
01:09:04.071 --> 01:09:05.800
And when you look at someone and they have the,

989
01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:10.490
and then the crazy thing is that somebody with that throw tattoo immediately are

990
01:09:10.491 --> 01:09:13.040
going to be like,
oof.
Right.
You're going to see it and they're going to be like,

991
01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:17.120
what?
You know what you did?
You know what you fucking did.

992
01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:22.120
It's the same thing as like,
uh,
when a woman has like the see through the shop.

993
01:09:22.150 --> 01:09:23.440
Yeah.
And they're like,
what are you looking at?

994
01:09:23.441 --> 01:09:28.100
I'm looking at your big stupid tits cause they're out.
Yeah.
Yeah,
of course.
Well,

995
01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:30.830
why?
Why can't I just do this and you don't mind.
We'll,

996
01:09:30.831 --> 01:09:33.490
because everybody's looking at put them away.
Stupid.
Yeah.

997
01:09:34.150 --> 01:09:38.960
Don't you slut shaming me like no sweetheart.
Put a picture of a Nobel prize.

998
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.090
Get over here and I'll take her your pussy.
You know?
No,

999
01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:46.420
but you didn't say,
where are we going for it?

1000
01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:49.550
You said throat over face.
Okay.
How about this?
Let's change,

1001
01:09:49.730 --> 01:09:52.910
let's change the game.
It's a face tattoo.
But any face tattoo you want,

1002
01:09:52.911 --> 01:09:55.460
you can get a teardrop.
You can get,

1003
01:09:57.290 --> 01:10:01.250
it's hard to decide on a face tattoo stars like Kat von D's got up.
I mean,

1004
01:10:01.251 --> 01:10:05.210
I would try to hide it.
I would,
I would do like an e under my beard,
you know,

1005
01:10:05.211 --> 01:10:08.810
for my sons initial or something.
But you can't hide it.
It's gotta be visible.

1006
01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:11.810
Visible.
Well,
I'm going to have facial hair.
What are,
what happens now?

1007
01:10:11.811 --> 01:10:15.380
It's gotta be like a teardrop,
like a gangbanger dude.
Come on your forehead.

1008
01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:18.860
No Way.
It's a knife.
Yeah.
No,
I'm not doing that.

1009
01:10:18.861 --> 01:10:23.270
He like Charles Manson clan.
Oh,
a swastika.
Yeah.

1010
01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:28.430
Originally they were exes and then later turned to swastika to x amount of

1011
01:10:28.431 --> 01:10:31.520
society.
I read a lot of stuff about Manson when I was growing up.

1012
01:10:32.510 --> 01:10:33.840
Dark side of the forest.
Can Pal,

1013
01:10:39.670 --> 01:10:43.870
cork,
Iran.
So what do you choose?
You're evading the question.

1014
01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.770
I do actually feel like the throat is crazier.
I think,

1015
01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:50.030
I think I would go through the face.

1016
01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:52.850
I think I would go through the face and you know,
I get,

1017
01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.440
I would get a dot on my nose somewhere.
Then I have a big black cat.
Yeah,

1018
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:59.420
I'll do that.
You know what I would want you to do?

1019
01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:04.200
I think you should get your eyebrows filled in.
Oh,
cool.
Yeah.

1020
01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:07.670
Like why won't you do the haircut I want you to get,

1021
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:09.620
now that we're talking about this stuff,

1022
01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:13.040
will you tell the audience I've asked you to do this multiple times?

1023
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:14.040
First of all,
I

1024
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:17.640
<v 5>don't think this is as funny as you do and you laugh hysterically every time</v>

1025
01:11:17.641 --> 01:11:20.730
we're laying in bed.
Just kind of like joking.
You Go,

1026
01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:25.550
why don't you shave the top of your head and give yourself a friar tuck?
Yeah.

1027
01:11:25.710 --> 01:11:29.660
You buzz the top and then you leave the,
the sides around it like a horseshoe.

1028
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:33.600
See,
look how happy you are.
I don't even think it's that funny.

1029
01:11:33.601 --> 01:11:38.100
And you think it's so funny.
I think it's a great idea.
Um,

1030
01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:43.200
I don't think it's that good.
What do you mean?
I don't like that?
Why?
No,

1031
01:11:43.201 --> 01:11:45.630
and you can't just get a dot on your nose.
You have to get,

1032
01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:49.530
there's rules because the throat piece is like this.
Okay.
Yeah.

1033
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:53.850
You have to get at least an inch,
an inch long,

1034
01:11:53.850 --> 01:11:58.850
an inch wide and in your face because the throat pieces way bigger and it's

1035
01:11:59.881 --> 01:12:03.360
solid.
It's not fair.
What if you,

1036
01:12:03.690 --> 01:12:06.810
what if you inked in your beard so you wouldn't have to grow on anymore?

1037
01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:11.220
That's a pretty good idea.
Maybe I'll do that.
Maybe I'll do that.

1038
01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:14.190
You could tattoo eyeliner.
I a lot of women do that.

1039
01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:18.930
You know they tattoo makeup on women.
No,
my step mom did it.

1040
01:12:18.931 --> 01:12:23.820
She tattooed on her eyeliner and you can tattoo lipstick looks fucking terrible,

1041
01:12:23.821 --> 01:12:24.654
but you can.

1042
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:29.110
Isn't that the craziest thing you've ever heard to tattoo your lipstick or eye?

1043
01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:33.090
Why would you,
why is it that important to have makeup on all the time?
So weird.

1044
01:12:34.090 --> 01:12:36.790
No,
no,
no.
What are you looking at?
I'm trying to find a picture.
Text.

1045
01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:41.610
Google Friar Tuck.
I did already.
And it's not,
it's not the exact hair hair cut.

1046
01:12:41.611 --> 01:12:45.270
I want you want a Mohican?
It's the last of the Mohicans.
It,
that's what that is.

1047
01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:48.870
Google last of the Mohicans.
Last of the Mohicans.
Yeah.
It's like a,

1048
01:12:48.871 --> 01:12:53.760
it's an Indian thing.
Not,
not,
uh,
the cowboy,

1049
01:12:53.761 --> 01:12:57.930
not diarrhea.
Indian.
Okay.
The cowboy.
Um,
well,

1050
01:12:57.931 --> 01:12:59.600
here's the images that come up,

1051
01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:06.780
like kind of that guy is when I was thinking,

1052
01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:12.400
I feel like it's a reverse Mohawk so that the top is gone and to reverse Mohawk.

1053
01:13:14.730 --> 01:13:17.880
Let's see.
Um,
what is it?
A fryer.

1054
01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:22.950
Friar Tuck company.
Get a Mohawk.
They look so good.

1055
01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:26.160
Haircut.
How about for a woman though?
That's the best.

1056
01:13:26.161 --> 01:13:29.760
Can I give Elyssa Mohawk when he's older?
Yeah,
of course.
Seriously.
Of course.

1057
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:34.850
Oh my God.
I love it.
Yeah,
no,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

1058
01:13:34.851 --> 01:13:35.684
yeah.
That's it.

1059
01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:40.440
<v 4>No,
that's not how I've enjoyed it.
I want you,
here's what,
okay,
here's the idea.</v>

1060
01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:44.910
God Damn Nice people out of it.
Or we saw,
I saw one picture of it somewhere.

1061
01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:50.070
Um,
I want you to shave.
Look,
yeah,
right here.
The top out.

1062
01:13:50.071 --> 01:13:53.550
So it's like when a man is balding,
like normal mail.
Yeah.

1063
01:13:53.551 --> 01:13:57.730
The horse shoe and then have all the hair long on the sides around it.

1064
01:13:57.810 --> 01:13:58.710
It's a friar Tuck,

1065
01:13:58.850 --> 01:14:01.080
but at the Friar Tuck it looks like it goes all the way around though.

1066
01:14:02.250 --> 01:14:04.350
That's the difference.
The Friar Tuck,

1067
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:07.000
<v 5>does anybody know what that Hairdo is called?
That my husband?</v>

1068
01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:12.430
<v 4>Yeah.
Which one?
This one?
Yeah,
it's pretty cool.
Um,</v>

1069
01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:13.623
<v 1>how about</v>

1070
01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:19.220
like male pattern baldness?
Oh,
in women.
Women.

1071
01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:24.850
Oh,
I'd hate to have that.
Yeah.
It's not what I had in mind.

1072
01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:27.820
And I want you to create it.
Um,

1073
01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:32.240
horseshoe horseshoe or,
yeah,

1074
01:14:32.890 --> 01:14:36.910
that guy's hair.
It's hilarious.
The Circle.
Okay.

1075
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.940
We get the point in time.
Yeah,
you get the idea.
But I want you to like this,

1076
01:14:39.941 --> 01:14:43.390
like this guy's hair right here.
See?
Right.
All shaved on top,

1077
01:14:43.450 --> 01:14:48.370
but long you're at longer.
I think that'd be real.
Give me if I did it honestly,

1078
01:14:48.371 --> 01:14:51.670
I would really give you whatever you wanted because I think it'd be in,

1079
01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:54.700
I think you'd end up thanking me though,
because you'd be like,
wow,

1080
01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:59.020
like this is a really cool haircut,
but I can't really do that.

1081
01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:04.540
Is there some other version I could do to get something from you?
I mean,
why?

1082
01:15:04.570 --> 01:15:07.750
Why do you think you can't do it?
You're going to stand out so much.

1083
01:15:07.810 --> 01:15:11.530
Can we fill your parents?
Can I get a fake throat tattoo?
Yes.

1084
01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:15.430
We've got to get on it though.
They're coming soon.
We got to get on it.

1085
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:21.040
What would you get me for the Friar Tuck a car.
You want a car for that

1086
01:15:22.690 --> 01:15:25.270
baby?
It's going to ruin everything.
I can't do stand up.
I can't do.

1087
01:15:25.271 --> 01:15:28.450
You can do stand up.
It's going to give you such a boost.
You're going to be,

1088
01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:33.190
you'll be on the today show the next week if you do that because they'll be
like,

1089
01:15:33.191 --> 01:15:35.830
have you seen how cool this new comedian is?
They'll think you're new,

1090
01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:41.140
but you'll you'll,
yeah,
or your throat.
Oh,

1091
01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:44.480
Dick.
All the way.
It would hurt a lot.
Yeah.

1092
01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:48.010
The whole thing is what do you put on there?
Your son's name?
No,

1093
01:15:48.011 --> 01:15:50.860
we put a message on there this way.

1094
01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:55.240
I saw one that had the word poison with an Arrow pointing towards the tip.

1095
01:15:55.390 --> 01:15:59.740
That's funny.
Yeah.
That's a pretty cool denim deck.
Yeah.

1096
01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:02.830
Wait,
so you did it dick over.

1097
01:16:02.890 --> 01:16:06.600
I'd put like these jeans need to get tell you what,

1098
01:16:06.601 --> 01:16:10.270
if you got fingerless gloves tattooed on your hands

1099
01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:17.770
or the throat.
I liked the idea of fingerless gloves tattooed on my Dick,

1100
01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:20.200
so it looks like someone's holding it.

1101
01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:24.610
I like that idea too.
But for this,

1102
01:16:24.611 --> 01:16:29.410
would you rather have fingerless gloves tattooed on full gloves?

1103
01:16:29.411 --> 01:16:30.244
Tattoos?

1104
01:16:30.970 --> 01:16:35.970
Fingerless it's such a homeless deck to have fingerless gloves or a bad look

1105
01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:38.960
throat cat at that checkout at tender green.

1106
01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:43.510
I'd go for the fucking horrific gloves and it has to be become part of my

1107
01:16:43.511 --> 01:16:44.344
persona.

1108
01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:49.270
Like you're holding a mic so we're targeting would be like,
wait,

1109
01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:52.040
why are you doing the dice there?
I'd be like,
Oh fuck.

1110
01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:53.980
And hickory dickory dock man.

1111
01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:58.210
Do you know how long it would take to Tattoo fingerless gloves?

1112
01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:00.700
I'm sure someone's done it.
We'll see if someone,

1113
01:17:02.530 --> 01:17:07.430
you'd have to do an image search school and they're like,
it's,
no,
no,

1114
01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:10.100
that's a tattoo.
Such

1115
01:17:10.110 --> 01:17:12.430
<v 5>a crazy,
I didn't know.</v>

1116
01:17:12.431 --> 01:17:15.260
It might be the craziest thing I've thought of in my life.

1117
01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:19.550
The fingerless gloves tattooed on your hands.
There's nothing worse than that.

1118
01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:23.120
There's no worst tattoo than that.
It's pretty bad.
The throat.

1119
01:17:23.121 --> 01:17:26.300
Ted's pretty aggressive,
but that just says,
I'm fucking out of my mind.

1120
01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:34.160
That's a really dumb thing to do.
Or is that,
is that a tenant like that?

1121
01:17:34.161 --> 01:17:38.420
It's like Henna though.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Those are just a real nice,

1122
01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:43.760
it's a nice pair of gloves to tattoo of fingerless gloves.

1123
01:17:45.250 --> 01:17:50.090
Yeah.
Fingerless gloves.
I hate fingerless gloves.
What is the point?

1124
01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:54.770
They don't keep anything warm.
The whole point is to keep your fingers,
Warren.

1125
01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:57.830
I am glad you still gives you that grip.

1126
01:17:57.831 --> 01:18:02.440
Your fingers can get out and take care of things,
but I like to drive with them.

1127
01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:04.730
Do you remember that?
That was a wedding gift for one of my friends.

1128
01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:08.900
It's so funny.
Justin gave me fingerless gloves as a wedding.
No,

1129
01:18:08.901 --> 01:18:13.750
he gave each one of us
together were a pair of finger.

1130
01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:19.830
I still have it in our,
one of my favorite things.
So funny.
Yeah.

1131
01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:21.500
This guy is a little muddy.

1132
01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:25.740
<v 15>Well,
what do you mean by that?
She was black.
Part of what she said.</v>

1133
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:30.140
So she no longer black.
That's what she said.
How she didn't say that

1134
01:18:31.650 --> 01:18:36.650
would be bad.
Yeah.
Well,
how'd you feel when you heard her say that?
I feel,

1135
01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:38.060
I felt like you dumb ass.

1136
01:18:38.061 --> 01:18:41.930
Don't you know that the Cosby's wasn't predominantly black show mother fucker.

1137
01:18:41.931 --> 01:18:45.230
That show audience.
Hilarious

1138
01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:47.991
Day.
I mean,

1139
01:18:47.991 --> 01:18:51.950
like I said last time I stand by her if she feels like she's Brittany Spears and

1140
01:18:52.010 --> 01:18:56.330
all by God let her be Britney Spears.
Goddammit.
Mr. Lane called me.

1141
01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:57.253
I don't give a shit.

1142
01:18:57.410 --> 01:18:59.780
<v 5>Oh,
hey.
Hey.
Now Orlando Brown</v>

1143
01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:04.490
<v 15>made another video about looking at breasts.
Yeah,
the Areola Areola,</v>

1144
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:08.510
right.
Well you said,
you said that she didn't,
she had clear every artist.

1145
01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:11.060
I said there was,
the whole titty was one color.

1146
01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:15.820
We usually the are different colors.
Let me tell you something.
Look,
no.

1147
01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:18.800
Takes Him all right now.
I said they will fucking name.
Let me tell you something.

1148
01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:27.650
<v 5>Yeah,
yeah.
It's happening.
Yeah.</v>

1149
01:19:27.770 --> 01:19:32.420
So now it's Raven has one titty color that's not that unusual.

1150
01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:37.580
My boobs were all one color pretty much before I had Ellis and now they're like,

1151
01:19:37.581 --> 01:19:40.940
I'm kind of an expert in those.
They,
they were not the nips.

1152
01:19:40.941 --> 01:19:43.890
We're not that different.
Yeah.
They were like,

1153
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.850
I was very pale and now it's totally different.
Now I have like purples,

1154
01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:49.283
mushy purples.

1155
01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:55.950
That is going to be the name of the next of my hour.
Mushy purples.
Why not?

1156
01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:58.980
I know.
I kind of like it too.
It's so fucking good,
man.

1157
01:19:59.130 --> 01:20:02.460
Unless you purples purples and now they are.

1158
01:20:02.490 --> 01:20:05.250
They're mushy and the nips or perps now everything's purple.

1159
01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:08.280
So weird and it hasn't gone back.
Write a bit

1160
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:12.240
<v 1>about where she purples.
I'm Gunna,
okay.
That's a good name.</v>

1161
01:20:12.430 --> 01:20:15.510
<v 15>I did.
It was,
it was.
It looked like it had a category.</v>

1162
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:20.470
What does a cataract is?
You ever seen her?
She don't want dogs.

1163
01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:25.500
I know it's,
it's just,
it's,
it's all one color around it.

1164
01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.600
It's just a big,
a big pink penis.
He did.

1165
01:20:28.530 --> 01:20:30.930
<v 1>Yeah.
He's talking about Ravens titties.
Do you like that watch?</v>

1166
01:20:30.931 --> 01:20:33.510
I'm going to get that for you.
You love watch us.

1167
01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:38.950
It's only $25,000 I'm going to take out a mortgage on the house that's more than

1168
01:20:39.271 --> 01:20:41.160
that.
Unless it's probably a fake.

1169
01:20:41.161 --> 01:20:45.930
Can I take out a second to get the absolutely for a watch.

1170
01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:47.100
It's a brilliant idea.

1171
01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:51.780
Do you remember my favorite thing ever is when you called top dog and you told

1172
01:20:51.781 --> 01:20:55.460
him we were so poor by the way are cute and so sweet.

1173
01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:59.160
We were living in the rampart division.
We had no money.
And you said to your dad,

1174
01:20:59.370 --> 01:21:00.203
dad,

1175
01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:04.920
how much I'm going to spend $100,000 I said I'm going to lease a Lamborghini.

1176
01:21:05.370 --> 01:21:09.330
And he was like,
okay,
I'm going to go.
So we've got to put this much down.

1177
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:13.590
And it was like something like 2,500 a month.

1178
01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:17.610
There's more than 2,500 that's it for a lambo.
No,
no.

1179
01:21:17.611 --> 01:21:22.020
I was telling him like it's,
I got,
you know,
we borrowed some money putting like,

1180
01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:26.650
you know we've got like $20,000 for a down payment and then a lease payments at

1181
01:21:26.651 --> 01:21:30.830
least like 2,500 it was like more than our rent at the time.
Quiet.

1182
01:21:31.130 --> 01:21:31.620
And then you know,

1183
01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:36.600
we're going to give up this and that and the whole idea is that all,

1184
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:41.490
um,
when we go to,
I'd go to stand up and people see me pull up,
they'll be like,

1185
01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:46.050
oh,
like this is like a significant guy,
you know,
big deal.
Yeah.

1186
01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:50.370
And you know,
this is a business of perception and stuff.
And he was like,
well,

1187
01:21:50.371 --> 01:21:53.460
if that's what you need to do and the best part is again,
and I was,

1188
01:21:53.461 --> 01:21:55.020
I was waiting for him to be like,
don't do it.

1189
01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:59.470
The best part is I can get it gets 10 mile per gallon,
10 miles per gallon.

1190
01:21:59.470 --> 01:22:02.040
I was like,
and I only can drive it like a thousand miles a year.

1191
01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:07.540
So I have to really,
really be careful of how often I drive it all the time.

1192
01:22:07.550 --> 01:22:12.010
He goes,
if you know,
I understand that that's different business.
So,
so sweet.

1193
01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:16.960
Totally was supporting my dad would not be supportive.
Yeah.
Not at all.
No,
no.

1194
01:22:17.550 --> 01:22:20.820
What am I dads say last time my dad's spins,
stealing our grapefruits.

1195
01:22:20.821 --> 01:22:24.660
We talk about this.
I don't remember if we talked.
He,
I remember he was like,

1196
01:22:24.810 --> 01:22:27.360
I remember from when I first met you,
weirdly,

1197
01:22:27.361 --> 01:22:31.230
one of my oldest memories of you as you telling me how much your dad likes

1198
01:22:31.231 --> 01:22:35.920
grapefruit.
He just fucking love science.
I love it too.
It's,
yeah,

1199
01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:40.310
it's in the genes,
but yeah,
no,
so he texts me,
he doesn't come over.
I,

1200
01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:45.150
he's seen Ellis.
My father seen Ellis maybe five times since he's been alive.

1201
01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:49.650
My son,
since we moved into this house,
we got two or three grapefruit trees.

1202
01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:53.760
[inaudible] and my dad texts me,
I might come over and get some grapefruits.
Okay.

1203
01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:57.510
And I'm like,
all right man.
And he comes and he goes,
oh,
it's too high.

1204
01:22:58.170 --> 01:23:02.550
The three is too high.
I'm going to go to the store,
I'll be back.
He goes,

1205
01:23:02.551 --> 01:23:07.520
he comes back the next day and now he's got a tool that the actual grape grape

1206
01:23:07.521 --> 01:23:08.354
fruit picker,

1207
01:23:08.710 --> 01:23:13.150
this motherfucker is now pulling down fruit from our trees and a lot too.

1208
01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:15.020
I was like,
all right,
get like a couple,
right?
Yeah.

1209
01:23:15.610 --> 01:23:18.820
He's out there pulling for like an hour every day.
He said,

1210
01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:21.550
and he stole maybe a whole back.

1211
01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:26.410
My memories of of grapes are Charro.
She Oh she,
no,

1212
01:23:26.411 --> 01:23:31.330
she never eats the hot in their back yard.
Oh,
that's why.
Yeah.
When I was a kid,

1213
01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:35.950
she's a slice grapefruit and pour honey into a little pocket,

1214
01:23:35.951 --> 01:23:39.240
like a little squirt and then that's how she would be great for it.

1215
01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:41.710
I want a grapefruit,
but so he bought the thing,

1216
01:23:41.711 --> 01:23:45.220
the picker I now he leaves you that are around,
you know,
my side of the house.

1217
01:23:45.730 --> 01:23:48.100
That's the only reason he comes to steal fruit.
No.

1218
01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:50.200
And then he like waves to the kid.

1219
01:23:50.230 --> 01:23:54.040
Did he even hold Ellis on a Thanksgiving thing?
So we looked at him.

1220
01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:58.390
He looked at it,
but what?
He's done a good job or anything.
Oh my God.

1221
01:23:59.470 --> 01:24:03.610
But he did.
He did.
He was like,
oh.
He goes,
you know,
they're still young now.

1222
01:24:03.670 --> 01:24:07.120
It's like there's not much to do with them.
You know,
as a grandfather,
I go,
yeah,

1223
01:24:07.121 --> 01:24:10.660
cause no four or five does when you can do things.
I'm like,
oh,

1224
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:14.230
he'll be back in about four or five years.
Yeah.
See you then Kiddo.

1225
01:24:14.590 --> 01:24:17.650
But what was saying like there's not much like not happening.

1226
01:24:17.651 --> 01:24:21.340
He's only learning to talk,
walk,
stand.
Uh,

1227
01:24:21.341 --> 01:24:25.540
develop a sense of self and separateness from his mother.
It's not a big time.

1228
01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:29.560
Not a lot going,
but he was like,
there's not much I can do.
Right,
right,
right,

1229
01:24:29.590 --> 01:24:30.423
right.

1230
01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:35.470
My favorite was when he heard us saying good job to Ellis to learn to eat.

1231
01:24:35.471 --> 01:24:39.580
Good job.
Good job.
He goes,
I don't know the same good job too much.

1232
01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:44.440
I think you say good job once at the end of the day he said one good job.
Not,

1233
01:24:44.441 --> 01:24:47.620
not all the time.
Yeah.
Cause otherwise you're saying it too much.
Too much.

1234
01:24:47.621 --> 01:24:51.010
She's like,
I hear these people,
women who are like,
oh you did a good job.

1235
01:24:51.011 --> 01:24:52.990
Good job.
Good job is too much.
Too much.

1236
01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:55.630
I can't wait to tell you said to tell your mom that story.

1237
01:24:55.690 --> 01:25:00.140
I think the Turner explode and what she's going to go like.
Wow.

1238
01:25:02.170 --> 01:25:05.860
Cause your,
your parents are the opposite.
Oh my God.
Very loving.
Well.

1239
01:25:05.861 --> 01:25:08.800
And they're also like,
they applaud,
like you say,
applaud a shit.

1240
01:25:09.250 --> 01:25:13.480
Tommy took a shit.
Everybody gather round.
Let's take a picture.
Oh,
I know.

1241
01:25:14.090 --> 01:25:17.890
Every,
every move.
They,
they,
they think it's the best thing ever.
Absolutely.

1242
01:25:17.891 --> 01:25:21.340
Look at your self esteem.
Look how successful you are through the roof.

1243
01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:25.420
Through the roof.
Yeah.
No,
that's why I look to you for guidance and guys,

1244
01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:30.370
speaking of self esteem,
uh,
the weight loss challenge is ongoing.
Um,

1245
01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:34.330
a slight update.
Uh,
I've been really good.
I've um,
uh,

1246
01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:39.360
made some adjustments to the Diet and I don't want to give away too much because

1247
01:25:39.970 --> 01:25:43.600
then why,
why should Burke a benefit from you or your knowledge?

1248
01:25:43.601 --> 01:25:47.950
Just know that I'm,
I'm fully immersed in this competition.

1249
01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:50.530
When you're winning,
I'm eating well,

1250
01:25:51.130 --> 01:25:56.130
I'm doing my exercise and let's just say the numbers are a changing.

1251
01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:59.410
Yeah,
well cause births on Instagram.

1252
01:25:59.411 --> 01:26:02.740
I saw he was an Indian apple today and he's partying.
Yeah.

1253
01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:06.770
Can't lose weight when you're partying.
And we'll see.

1254
01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:09.050
We'll have to see what happens as they like to say.

1255
01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:12.140
I might tell you what happens.
He's fat.
Yeah.
Well,

1256
01:26:12.141 --> 01:26:16.480
there's no doubt about that fast kind of permit,
but Nah,
man,
I mean that,

1257
01:26:16.481 --> 01:26:19.820
that I said all that to say it's just bullshit.
I said nothing.
He said nothing.

1258
01:26:20.150 --> 01:26:23.880
I said nothing,
man.
I said,
I said enough to get people to watch and they watch.

1259
01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:28.030
Yeah,
you just did.
Yeah.
Silly goose.
I liked the guy.

1260
01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:31.460
I gotta say I like him in the crevice of your pussy.

1261
01:26:34.850 --> 01:26:38.660
I don't like when he juggles it and stuff,
but I like him.
I think he's,

1262
01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:43.040
he's a cute guy.
He's in a,
I don't know,
he's a cute guy.
He's a nice guy.

1263
01:26:43.041 --> 01:26:46.410
He's handsome.
Um,
Bandana.

1264
01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:49.340
But I liked how he looked in the other one.
He's got nice teeth.

1265
01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:54.400
I feel like you have a real strict policy on leftovers.

1266
01:26:55.470 --> 01:27:00.410
Um,
it's like when there's food in the fridge from the day before,
you're like,

1267
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:05.270
is this all right to eat?
I don't like,
yeah,
it's from last night now.
Like,
uh,

1268
01:27:05.271 --> 01:27:06.230
I think we got to,
I'm like,

1269
01:27:06.231 --> 01:27:11.231
that's the whole point of taking it like in a bag to go home.

1270
01:27:11.511 --> 01:27:14.930
Not True.
You're talking about Sushi leftovers,

1271
01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:20.030
which you should not store Sushi and then eat it two or three days later.

1272
01:27:20.031 --> 01:27:23.900
That's not three days later.
That's crazy.
Of course.
I never do that.

1273
01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:28.340
What I do do three days later,
just fucking insane.
She like a day later,

1274
01:27:28.341 --> 01:27:29.800
which I think you can definitely do.

1275
01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:35.290
You can have dinner at Sushi dinner and put it in the fridge and have it the

1276
01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:40.130
next day.
I disagree.
I think that
properly.

1277
01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:44.990
Maybe the,
maybe the Sushi chefs,
they store their temperature.
You have fish.

1278
01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:49.610
Are you have an ally and not necessarily a Sushi board?
Leftovers as plies.

1279
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:51.020
Plies has an opinion on it.

1280
01:27:51.810 --> 01:27:54.760
<v 16>To explain to some of y'all when I just had to tell my mom,</v>

1281
01:27:56.830 --> 01:27:58.220
you bought it though.
The leftovers away.

1282
01:28:17.230 --> 01:28:21.900
That wasn't wasn't bad.
You're pushing it Sunday.

1283
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:26.390
Monday.
Yeah.

1284
01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:29.800
You still eating them leftover

1285
01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:36.220
hospital day.
Then at the bottom line for the though,

1286
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:40.370
<v 1>that's a good point.
He says Friday is the best it's going to taste.
He's right.</v>

1287
01:28:40.371 --> 01:28:44.810
He's saying he's using Thanksgiving as an example,
so he's thanks.
Thanksgiving,

1288
01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:48.050
the food obviously the next day,
most of the two left.

1289
01:28:48.051 --> 01:28:51.770
His primary laughter is the best day you saying right?
The next day.

1290
01:28:52.970 --> 01:28:56.540
The day after day after,
which is my point.
So they're after is fine.

1291
01:28:56.570 --> 01:29:00.770
I think you're pushing it by Saturday.
Saturday.
Okay.

1292
01:29:00.771 --> 01:29:03.390
Wednesday you're doing the cooking?
Yes.
Okay,

1293
01:29:03.391 --> 01:29:06.030
so it wasn't I Thursday's the day of Thanksgiving.

1294
01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:10.250
Wednesday night you're prepping and Thursday you cook,
you cook it,

1295
01:29:10.251 --> 01:29:14.710
the rest of it you eat Friday's fantastic.
I'm throwing them out by Saturday.
God,

1296
01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:15.840
seriously.
Yeah.

1297
01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:19.170
You can definitely have some of that on Saturday can I don't think,

1298
01:29:19.171 --> 01:29:21.020
I'm not saying that you can't,
I don't think.

1299
01:29:21.021 --> 01:29:24.960
I think really pushing it with all of that kind of food with Sushi.

1300
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:27.690
I definitely think the next day is fine.
I don't think so.

1301
01:29:27.890 --> 01:29:31.630
I I don't it's fresh or nothing with raw fish are out of your fucking

1302
01:29:32.630 --> 01:29:33.463
<v 16>yes,</v>

1303
01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:43.580
that's right.
And get a match refrigerator.
Yeah,

1304
01:29:44.050 --> 01:29:47.590
<v 1>that's right.
He's right.
He's right about everything is right.</v>

1305
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:50.303
<v 16>Yeah.</v>

1306
01:29:52.930 --> 01:29:55.060
<v 1>We haven't heard from him in a while.
We'll apply.</v>

1307
01:29:55.061 --> 01:29:57.310
I know it was sweet pussy Saturday.
Can I tell you something?

1308
01:29:57.370 --> 01:29:59.590
Your teeth looks so much better that you've widened them.

1309
01:30:00.250 --> 01:30:03.010
So that was my dental update.
Um,
I was going to do dental update today,

1310
01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:05.470
but we mentioned that during one of the songs you're like,
great.

1311
01:30:05.471 --> 01:30:09.130
Remember the other night I told you,
you look healthy,

1312
01:30:09.131 --> 01:30:10.300
you look like you eat right.

1313
01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:16.420
Here's what I did.
I told her,
I go,
remind me,

1314
01:30:16.421 --> 01:30:20.770
remind me last week when we were doing the show and then I was,

1315
01:30:20.771 --> 01:30:24.940
you were gone and I was about to just wind down and I go,

1316
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.810
do I want to go and get the trays and then go in the fridge and you have to

1317
01:30:27.811 --> 01:30:31.000
think.
And I was like,
and I go,
well,
I just asked for a reminder.

1318
01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:35.790
I'm just gonna fucking do it.
So I got the trays ready,
got the shell.
Did it burn?

1319
01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:40.000
No,
but the next morning my teeth were aching.

1320
01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:43.980
That means it works.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1321
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:48.810
If it burns the next day and it's tender to heat and cold,
that means you,

1322
01:30:48.890 --> 01:30:53.310
you burn the shit out.
You get that layer of,
oh my God,
they look,

1323
01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:59.130
I didn't do a Giuliani.
I did tops and bottoms.
Let's look at Rudy's teeth.

1324
01:30:59.131 --> 01:31:03.030
You want it.
It's either nasty,
nasty,
Rudy Giuliani.

1325
01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:06.900
His teeth are the worst and he can afford better teeth.
Dude,

1326
01:31:07.570 --> 01:31:11.930
fix your fucking teeth.
Weird beard.
He said this guy,

1327
01:31:12.510 --> 01:31:16.000
God damn,
he's a weird dog.
He's a weird dude.
Let's see.
Yeah,

1328
01:31:16.050 --> 01:31:20.550
the tops look aggressive.
He's got one shot of him.
Yeah,

1329
01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:25.460
it's terrible.
It's when he's talking.
Ah.

1330
01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:30.570
Oh my God.
The bottoms are just rotten yellows.
Oh my God.

1331
01:31:31.530 --> 01:31:34.650
That was a real bad names that you're so nasty,
Rudy.

1332
01:31:34.651 --> 01:31:38.030
You got to fix that buttery popcorn all over the did.

1333
01:31:38.090 --> 01:31:42.660
He's got dad mouth for sure.
Like bonded.
There's aren't even like,

1334
01:31:43.110 --> 01:31:45.780
those aren't the days veneers.
Those are the ones I used to have.
Right.

1335
01:31:46.230 --> 01:31:49.080
He's got his from the 90s still.
I think he needs to have a free fixed,

1336
01:31:49.390 --> 01:31:51.120
fixed this whole,
just go do the whole thing.

1337
01:31:51.450 --> 01:31:56.070
And the veneers they do now are amazing.
They're glass.
They're translucent.

1338
01:31:56.370 --> 01:32:00.110
Those are the old ass ones that were there.
Just like chalk.
Yeah.
They're

1339
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:01.810
<v 4>not see through.
They're not translucent.
Right off.</v>

1340
01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:03.780
They look like fake choppers with a bottle.

1341
01:32:04.870 --> 01:32:09.340
Those are yellow and tartar felt.
They look really bad.
Can I tell you something?

1342
01:32:09.341 --> 01:32:11.590
A lot of people say he just cares about the upper class,
you know?

1343
01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:21.720
<v 5>Can I tell you some real talk?
Yeah.
When you and I are 60 years old.
Yeah.</v>

1344
01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:25.070
If you have a mouth that's like this,

1345
01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:29.070
it's full of tartar and yellow and brown.
Guess what?
Yeah.

1346
01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:32.660
I'm not kissing your mouth and I'm not putting my mouth on your junk either.

1347
01:32:32.690 --> 01:32:35.670
Yeah,
of course.
Nasty.
Shouldn't cause you're going to get done at that.

1348
01:32:36.050 --> 01:32:40.870
<v 4>That issue.
You go get the nice high quality.</v>

1349
01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:45.360
<v 5>Yes.
Just have a nice face every 10 years.
15 years.</v>

1350
01:32:45.470 --> 01:32:49.410
Got To have your teeth redid.
Yeah.
Sorry.
That's the fucking cost of admission.

1351
01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:52.790
We don't want it to white like Dennis.
Uh,
no because

1352
01:32:52.890 --> 01:32:55.520
<v 4>didn't get the good ones though.
Yeah.
He got Shitty,
shitty.</v>

1353
01:32:55.521 --> 01:32:58.440
Even you've got to go to a specialist and they'll do,

1354
01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:02.270
they'll make even like age appropriate veneers.
They'll be like,
well we'll,

1355
01:33:02.271 --> 01:33:04.980
we'll make them fucking billboard wide.

1356
01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:09.960
We'll make it look so it looks like you have nice teeth.
Yeah.
For your age.

1357
01:33:10.290 --> 01:33:12.480
Kind of goes with your skin,
like you know.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1358
01:33:12.530 --> 01:33:16.120
<v 5>The,
the natural.
They follow the shape of your natural tooth.
Yeah,</v>

1359
01:33:16.290 --> 01:33:19.850
that sounds stupid.
The guy looks terrible.
Yeah,
it looks fucking terrible.

1360
01:33:20.130 --> 01:33:22.400
He looks like a a skeleton,

1361
01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:28.230
<v 4>like a skull head.
You know those big fight fake white choppers.
Never stop.</v>

1362
01:33:28.450 --> 01:33:31.760
It makes it last night we were testing audio.
It didn't stop making me laugh.

1363
01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:33.260
I still laugh at

1364
01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:37.310
<v 10>the fucking go down right there.
All right.</v>

1365
01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:47.770
Do you ever seen a moose coming down right quick?
Oh,

1366
01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:51.680
oh God.
I was raised.
That is awesome.

1367
01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:56.140
<v 4>Such a dad boner.
I can.
Garth Brooks went hunting.
Yep.</v>

1368
01:33:56.420 --> 01:34:01.210
<v 10>We got out here early board and look at the look at the metal.
This is why,</v>

1369
01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:04.410
this is why we came up here.
When we bring the,

1370
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:08.650
sounds like it's going to cry to battle big,
long,
tall metal.

1371
01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:10.360
We'd been slipping along here.

1372
01:34:10.570 --> 01:34:15.570
Just glass and just glass and glass and all of a sudden literally I had even

1373
01:34:15.581 --> 01:34:18.230
hoped,
I didn't even put my head in it all.
I'm like,
oh,
we're just glassing.

1374
01:34:18.231 --> 01:34:19.120
He pictured by those.

1375
01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:24.110
<v 5>Is this for a TV show or this is just,

1377
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:34.290
Oh yeah.
Tell me everything.
Yeah,
he,
he's a big time hunter.
Like he's,

1378
01:34:34.291 --> 01:34:39.110

Yeah,

I'm here.

1379
01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:41.750
I'm here.
Let me pull up a

1380
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:45.340
<v 5>you guys name.

1381
01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:49.210
the Moose just glass glass.

1382
01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:52.700
Let me do a timeline.
And you know what?

1383
01:34:52.701 --> 01:34:56.500
I usually have a snarky thing to say for people.
I,

1384
01:34:56.630 --> 01:35:00.470
I just love his joy.
I have,
I have nothing Shitty to say about the dad.

1385
01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:04.130
The Moose Dad.
Like,
he's so rad.
He's a nice guy.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1386
01:35:04.131 --> 01:35:06.320
Well you can tell he cares about his family probably.

1387
01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:09.650
He's probably an an just a nice dude.

1388
01:35:10.540 --> 01:35:14.280
<v 1>Um,
okay,
so here I am.
Let's see.</v>

1389
01:35:16.710 --> 01:35:20.550
Pepper Chutney.
He said Angel Pepperoni's.

1390
01:35:20.551 --> 01:35:24.600
Just a sweet little angel dog.
Okay,

1391
01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:27.900
so I put this,
uh,
oh yeah,

1392
01:35:27.901 --> 01:35:32.460
the shirt up and that's how it,
it.
Uh,
people started telling me who he was,

1393
01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:37.500
just glass and his name.
Hold on,
hold on.

1394
01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:39.510
I'm going to give it to you.
Just people were like,

1395
01:35:39.511 --> 01:35:44.100
I got a huge dad boner for this.
How do I see the video?
People put it up.

1396
01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:48.780
Give me a second.
Yeah,
apparently he does.

1397
01:35:48.781 --> 01:35:52.620
He does guided tours too,
you know,
so if you,

1398
01:35:53.370 --> 01:35:57.660
if you want to go hang out with the glass and dad with the glass and guy,

1399
01:35:57.661 --> 01:36:00.330
you can,
yeah.
Holy Shit.
What's his name?

1400
01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:06.720
His name?
I'm trying to,
I'm trying to pull it up.
Just give me a second talk.
Talk.

1401
01:36:07.870 --> 01:36:08.640
All right.

1402
01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:12.330
<v 5>Um,
I,
I still feel like he is Canadian though.</v>

1403
01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:17.420
I hear a Canadian thing and the Moose hunting element to me is Canada,

1404
01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:21.150
so I don't know where the fuck this guy is from.

1405
01:36:21.151 --> 01:36:24.960
I'd like to know more about his story.
I think he's still from Canada.

1406
01:36:24.961 --> 01:36:28.800
I don't care what you guys fucking say that you ride any got from Canada.

1407
01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:32.610
How can you say that?
I don't think he sounds American.

1408
01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:34.440
This guy sounds Canadian.

1409
01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:40.460
<v 1>Come on.
F A r.
T.
F.
A.
R.</v>

1410
01:36:40.670 --> 01:36:43.340
T.
Here it is.
Okay.
And here is,

1411
01:36:43.370 --> 01:36:46.370
what's the Red Fred who's name is Fred.

1412
01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:52.280
Fred Eichler.
Yup.
Fred Eichler.
There you go.
Here we go.

1413
01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:56.060
I'm going to look them up for you.
I did this yesterday and I lost the,
uh,

1414
01:36:56.870 --> 01:37:01.130
he has a passion for bow hunting.
You know,

1415
01:37:01.190 --> 01:37:05.600
clearly America's favorite hunter.
It was so,

1416
01:37:06.010 --> 01:37:09.900
I was Canadian born and maybe he's Canadian boring.

1417
01:37:10.340 --> 01:37:12.440
Fucking know that Shit,
man.

1418
01:37:12.441 --> 01:37:17.150
Of what about Fred was the same amount of personal achievement and his passion

1419
01:37:17.151 --> 01:37:20.300
for bow hunting is taking them all over the world in pursuit of his next

1420
01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:25.070
adventure.
Fred truly believes that any animal with a bow is a trophy.

1421
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:29.360
Okay,
his personal,
any animal with a bow.
Okay.

1422
01:37:29.830 --> 01:37:34.830
It's personal quest to complete the North American super slam with a recurve bow

1423
01:37:35.210 --> 01:37:39.110
reflects that state of mind.
And Mid August of 2009,

1424
01:37:39.111 --> 01:37:44.111
Fred harvest at a cow tool elk to become the first to take all 29 North American

1425
01:37:45.141 --> 01:37:48.560
big game animals with a recurve bow and complete the super slam.

1426
01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:51.560
Fred has been fortunate enough to share his love,
enthusiasm,

1427
01:37:51.561 --> 01:37:54.020
and support with fellow hundred and it was a country,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1428
01:37:54.021 --> 01:37:57.510
Who gives a shit to a way of life.
He loves it.
He absolutely loves it.

1429
01:37:57.511 --> 01:38:01.910
Real die hard.
North American Super Slam.
Now.
See,

1430
01:38:01.950 --> 01:38:06.030
that's why it leads me to believe he is Canadian because we don't refer to it as

1431
01:38:06.031 --> 01:38:06.960
North America

1432
01:38:07.710 --> 01:38:11.820
<v 4>American here.
You guys got a family.
Yeah.
See?
Oh,</v>

1433
01:38:11.970 --> 01:38:16.710

Family Guy.

1434
01:38:16.711 --> 01:38:20.970
Three boys home about Fred.
Contact Fred.
Fred's gear.

1435
01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:24.920
I'll see a glass insured.
Why aren't you glass and Bro?

1436
01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:30.630

He has a real deal.

1437
01:38:30.810 --> 01:38:34.710
Yeah.
Very cool.
Anyways,

1445
01:39:08.211 --> 01:39:12.740

Windsor,
Ontario.
Proud Windsor native.

1446
01:39:12.741 --> 01:39:15.200

You're going to type out an email while talking to each other.

What do you mean you can't think of something about this?
I uh,

1465
01:40:28.220 --> 01:40:31.110
you guys were talking last week about the,
uh,

1466
01:40:31.410 --> 01:40:35.400
the Super Bowl and how stupid the music is and how stupid.

1467
01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:40.720
What is it all just fuck,

on a Sunday night and Monday night football tonight.
You're gonna love it.

1469
01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:51.750
And we were talking about how the corporations have ruined all these uh,

1470
01:40:51.751 --> 01:40:54.310
stadium arena names and how oppressive

1471
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:58.120
<v 5>and depressing that shit is.
Same thing goes for,
um,</v>

1472
01:40:58.270 --> 01:41:03.270
children's things because we went to go to Tarjay to get Ellis' first birthday,

But no,

1477
01:41:20.110 --> 01:41:22.000
Can I just have a fucking truck?
The kid likes trucks.

1478
01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:27.180
Well we have a Disney cars thing or a despicable me part three fucking character

That just making shit that kids liked.

1480
01:41:32.111 --> 01:41:35.760
Now it all has to be sponsored by Pixar and Disney.
It's really depressing.
Yeah,

1481
01:41:35.770 --> 01:41:39.190
it's really crazy.
I feel like I was at the end of 60 minutes there.

1482
01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:43.040
Is that morally Schaefer's Oh yeah.

1484
01:41:50.230 --> 01:41:54.570
it makes a noise.
Did you know that people work on that noise?

1485
01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:59.520
That was one of his one time about the way that a door on a car sounds different

1486
01:41:59.521 --> 01:42:00.390
from car to car.

1487
01:42:01.110 --> 01:42:05.970
People working on that to make the car doors.
They're French.

1488
01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:10.560
Okay.
I wrote where's Fred phone?
