1
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.290
Well.
Well,
well go to your mom's house,

2
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.990
Christina Vincent.

3
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.600
<v 0>Yeah,
it is a,
it's a very nice jacket.
Thank you.
I,
you asked me,</v>

4
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.950
well how much do you think a jacket like this cost time?

5
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.870
500 bucks at $30 is cool.

6
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.740
It's like a cheapy h and m he drag it.
That's where I get all my stuff cheap.

7
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.000
That shit looks fly man.
Thanks Bro.
Toes gels and my summer bomber.

8
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:41.930
Look at Joe Sam.
It looks,
uh,
it looks like a downtown flag here.

9
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.760
Like little little Tokyo gear.
Like I'm cool and I know where to shop stuff.
Yeah,

10
00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:50.330
it does.
You know what?
I was a little afraid of real talk.
What's up?

11
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.790
Is that the prince floral?

12
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.960
I was kind of afraid of looking like a Tommy Bahama Dad.
Oh No,

13
00:00:56.961 --> 00:00:58.390
it does not look like,
are you sure?
No,

14
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.730
cause my stepdad used to wear Tommy Bahama all the time with these horrible

15
00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:05.390
prints and I'm like,
it's Kinda like,
it's a little tiny.
It doesn't like that,

16
00:01:05.391 --> 00:01:08.960
I promise.
Okay,
let's do a proper show open.

17
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.500
And I was saying we'll get into everything.
Show me all the time now.

18
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.340
Very exciting,
very exciting stuff.
Here we go.
Here we go.

19
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.480
Population defense.

20
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.320
Here's another instance when you need to give the appearance of going along with

21
00:01:21.321 --> 00:01:24.710
what is happening.
If you're being forced down to orally,

22
00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:27.260
copulate your attacker and defense is simple.

23
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.540
Quit fighting and wait for your chance.
Then bite off his penis.

24
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.410
<v 1>Don't bring in in loving.</v>

25
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.700
Well,
go to your mom's house,

26
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.783
Christina.

27
00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.493
Yeah.

28
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.350
<v 0>You know what I'm saying?
This is how I feel every time I'm forced to orally.</v>

29
00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:36.520
Copulate.
You feel like doing this to me?
No.
I just know that I have to surrender.

30
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.960
I had to give it.
Why?
Why?
Why do you feel like my attacker?

31
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.390
I'm not an attacker.
I'm your spouse.
You're always trying to trick me too.

32
00:02:44.391 --> 00:02:47.500
You're like,
oh,
I'm soft.
I need help,
and then I go down there and you're like,

33
00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:48.334
just kidding.

34
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.340
That's what Bobby likes to do to bite off his penis,
Trish.
Yeah.
Yeah.

35
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.440
Bobby is all about it.
Trish wouldn't do that though.
Just would never bite off.

36
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.810
No Way.
Trish lives for the Goblin Cox.
Whoa.
That's what she loves.

37
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:08.980
That's Trish.
Karen our trash.
They both are the boat down.

38
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.370
My favorite thing about both of them,
they're super done

39
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.930
love.
So low self esteem chicks,

40
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.800
they are the best for one for that thing for loving.

41
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.950
So I'm assuming that's what I hear.
Oh yeah.

42
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.790
I won't give away too much better marital love makings but by being Trish had a

43
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:32.980
rendezvous.
Yeah they did.
And uh,

44
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.490
it was funny cause I rendezvous with my triple d s l u t

45
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.850
came up with that one.
That was funny.
That was good.
But um,

46
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.190
it was funny cause I,
I had a thing I was trying to unbutton right.

47
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.910
And then you were,
and then,

48
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.220
and then you said something and you just were patient with me and I was like,
no,

49
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:56.650
Bobby wouldn't be patient.
They'll say,
oh Bobby would say,

50
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.360
cause you were on buttoning like this road.
It's hard to,
and you're like,

51
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.630
oh I'm sorry.
And I go,
you could,
what would you say right now?
I go,
okay,

52
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.020
just take your time.
And you're like,
no,
be Bobby.
Oh Jesus.
All right.

53
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.100
Rip that thing off then.
Fuck.
You were like,
yeah,
you're like,

54
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.280
I don't give a shit.
Rebut the tear it,
tear it off,

55
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.800
bitch.
Yeah.
That's really funny.
Yeah,
that is neat.
Anyways,

56
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.380
I went to the 99 cent store today,

57
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.920
which for me in eastern blocker who hates spending money.

58
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:33.550
That is like Jack.
Yeah man.

59
00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:36.700
I forgot how cool it is there and how much shit there is to buy for now.

60
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.110
I'm not really a 99 cent guy,
but one of the thing that is great,

61
00:04:40.111 --> 00:04:44.790
one thing that I have bought there before,
it's like cleaning supplies,
things,

62
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.590
you know,
sponges and yeah,
little whatever,
Windex,
all that kind of bullshit.

63
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.050
It's great.
Crazy it.
They sell it there for that much.

64
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.390
There's so much cool stuff there now.

65
00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:57.330
It's gotten really good and they have really neat Halloween things.

66
00:04:57.331 --> 00:05:00.810
I got really excited.
I lucked out so much in this,

67
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.220
in the spending department and the chief was all I heard about growing up.

68
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.920
I always go,
ah,
my wife spends money.

69
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.320
It's all she does and you're like,

70
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.830
I got this thing for two hours I thought can tell you I'm a tell you guys.

71
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.680
I got so excited because I saw the Halloween aisle and it was really good.

72
00:05:19.681 --> 00:05:20.910
Like they have really good stuff there.

73
00:05:20.911 --> 00:05:25.470
I was very surprised and I actually walked through it and I felt a Pang of

74
00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:30.230
guilt,
like I shouldn't buy us.
I was kind of fancy,
you know?

75
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.090
And then I walked the isles and then I went back and I was like,

76
00:05:33.091 --> 00:05:35.910
you know what Christina,
you can treat yourself right here.

77
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.860
And I spent 20 whole dollars.
Wow.
Halloween stuff.
And I,

78
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.890
that's a lot of stuff at the 99 cents for the 20 things is anything over 99

79
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.370
cents?
99 cents is a starting point.
There are some items,

80
00:05:52.371 --> 00:05:56.460
the nicer ones that are a dollar 99.
Whoa.
But they're really nice.

81
00:05:56.461 --> 00:06:00.890
She would never,
you're going to see the Halloween decorations I got are so nice.

82
00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.880
Okay.
Okay.
Beyonce.
So excited.
Jesus.
Anyway,

83
00:06:05.881 --> 00:06:09.090
I got a lot of stuff for LJ for the airplane.
Right on Sunday,
uh,

84
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.530
a mom friend of mine told me to buy a bunch of shift in the 99 cent store for

85
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:17.030
him to play with on the plane.
You know what?
I'm saying I didn't get them toys.

86
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:20.620
I got him like kitchenware and shit like he likes to play with,
you know?
Yup.

87
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.000
And um,
they had a glow in the dark acts and I probably posted on Instagram.

88
00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:27.200
I thought of you immediately.
It's like,

89
00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:30.110
it's like a little evil kid with a glow in the dark acts.
Yeah,

90
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:32.810
we got that for him.
Of course.
I was like,

91
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.850
is this not Tom Segura his son right here,

92
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.530
so he could be like a little ax murderer.
Yeah.

93
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.230
Isn't that neat for the flight though?
Right?
Courses for the flea.
Oh really?

94
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.520
Well it's a glow in the dark.
I mean,
you know,
I figured why not?

95
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.670
I talked about it with my shrink today and well,
uh,

96
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.140
look,
he,
she told me,
she goes,
he's going to cry during takeoff and landing.

97
00:06:57.141 --> 00:07:00.890
You should count on that because their ears are very fragile at that age.

98
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.550
And uh,
you know,
just,
you know that that's an inevitability.

99
00:07:04.551 --> 00:07:07.220
Give him something to suck on,
like a bottle.
Right.
Milk.

100
00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.170
Give him as Baba and uh,
you know.
Oh.
And she said the crying,

101
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:15.590
he's actually good cause that's how they unplugged their ears through crying.

102
00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:19.910
It'll help the process.
So she goes,
it's actually a good thing.
And you know,

103
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:23.960
I have a big fear of losing control.
That's my thing.
I got control issues.

104
00:07:23.961 --> 00:07:26.090
So for me,
the baby crying like that on.

105
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.280
And I also am afraid of judgment of other people.

106
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.570
It's not so much the freak out because he's freaked out in public before,

107
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.610
but it's that it's in an enclosed space.

108
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.960
It's heightened and we're going to ruin other people's flight.
That's my fear.

109
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.860
And them looking at me like this dumb fuck woman doesn't know how to take care

110
00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:47.600
of her kid.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So what do you,
what's your biggest,
uh,

111
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.450
I dunno.
I mean,
talking to friends,
one of my friends was like,
well,
you know,

112
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:55.430
your kid's going to cry.
You can't worry about that stuff.
People,

113
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.730
people know that kids cry.
Yeah.

114
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.180
And they've been around kids before and you know,
if they're irritated by it,

115
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.630
that's just part of it.
When you do your best,
obviously to try to,

116
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.670
to get over it.
But yeah,
I have total anxiety about a total.

117
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:15.320
And I remembered it's similar to the anxiety.
I'm also very sensitive to that,

118
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.770
to others.
Other people being like,
oh my God,
I'm in a restaurant.
If he bangs,
uh,

119
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.460
a fork against the table,
you know,
like I'll grab him and be like,
Hey,

120
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.410
I don't want to bother other people.
Yeah.
I'm the same.
Um,

121
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.230
I had the same panic the first time I flew with fif back in the day.

122
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:33.890
Super Nervous,
so scary.

123
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.240
I would relax when I finally put it under the seat and his shield and I was
like,

124
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.180
and then I'll get anxiety if the person next to me,
like,
can I get out?

125
00:08:44.181 --> 00:08:48.560
I'd be like,
oh,
just be careful because he does a dog.
Okay.

126
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:53.150
Yeah.
You know what apologetic.
But you know what that is.
I mean,
for me anyways,

127
00:08:53.151 --> 00:08:56.370
it's,
it's my perfectionism where if I'm not a perfect,

128
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.980
I'm not perfect at being a mom,
that I'm a piece of shit.

129
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:02.430
That's my big thing is don't like then,
then it means that I'm a bad person.

130
00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:03.580
If I could help you,

131
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.070
<v 2>uh,
get over that.
So I can some dude's dig.
Not some dude,</v>

132
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:14.160
my friend Kevin.
If you blow him,
you'll feel better.

133
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.570
Who's Kevin?
I Dunno.
It's this guy.
Nice guy.
The guy.

134
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.930
You're a our son's real dad.
What?

135
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.850
You don't think LJ is your son?
I have thoughts.
I have doubts.

136
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.330
And what part of that?
What part of him?
You know,
you don't,

137
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.830
don't you think resembles you or no,
no,
no.
Sometimes I look at them and I'm like,

138
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.790
what was your Bio Dad?
Okay Bob.

139
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.170
<v 3>Hey,
she's really,</v>

140
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:49.880
<v 0>this will cause shock and definitely end.
Any thoughts about rape?
Definitely.
Oof.</v>

141
00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:54.750
It's terrifying.
But it is a crazy thing.
I like his haircut though.
Look at that.

142
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.230
Yeah,
it's definitely eighties he's a super dad.

143
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.540
Let's take another look at this defense.

144
00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:01.683
<v 3>Oh yeah.</v>

145
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.370
<v 0>He's telling you to suck it.
You're pushing back.
I fucking,
well,</v>

146
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.540
if you want to survive,
you'll consider this a fence technique girl,
which I mean,

147
00:10:12.541 --> 00:10:15.300
is there a cucumber?
Yeah.
Or He's had a real bloody dark.

148
00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:20.770
He had a really green,
dark dick.
Wow.
And they showed her biting it and he's all,

149
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.340
this will cause shock.
And definitely.
And any thoughts about rape?
Hell yeah,

150
00:10:26.341 --> 00:10:29.580
definitely.
I don't know who wrote that.
But they deserve an award.
Yeah.

151
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.260
He ain't rape.
And now here you go.
Rape.
Now deck bed off your dicks off.

152
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.890
Didn't have,
that is a really good tactic.
I,
I mean,
if I were,

153
00:10:37.891 --> 00:10:39.360
if I had the wherewithal to do it,

154
00:10:39.361 --> 00:10:42.860
I definitely would in that situation to just put it in your mouth.
Right.

155
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.580
The fuck out of that deck,
Dude.
Yeah.

156
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.100
<v 2>Rip His fucking nuts off too.
Yeah.</v>

157
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:52.380
I wonder if Jim Ryan the Dick,
if he would then have a case against you,
you know,

158
00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.000
feel like I was,
yeah,
I was going for it,
but like she didn't have to bite it off.

159
00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:01.200
Oh,
I bite it off.
Yeah.
It's fucking,
yeah.

160
00:11:01.201 --> 00:11:03.670
Nothing sounds worse than a,
than a dick bite.

161
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:09.140
<v 0>No.
And then you have the dig blood in your mouth and everything.
It's not good,</v>

162
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.100
but know.
Right.

163
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:18.350
And I also wonder if my veneers can handle that kind of a bike.
Oh,
right.
I mean,

164
00:11:18.351 --> 00:11:19.850
I can't even buy an apple.

165
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:24.530
<v 2>You'd have a hell of a dental update.
Your dentist would flip.</v>

166
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:28.430
You're like,
what happened with like,
I bet this dude's dick off.
What?

167
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.400
<v 0>This guy's Dick in my mouth.
[inaudible] it off.</v>

168
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.440
I get pictures to show him and he's just like,
yeah,

169
00:11:35.441 --> 00:11:37.950
let me put you know what's on the house today.
Don't worry about anything.

170
00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:41.760
All the charges.
Do you think a lot of women forced men to go down on them?

171
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.400
You think that's an epidemic?
No,
I don't think so.

172
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.880
But it definitely has happened and continues to happen.

173
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:52.920
There's just not a lot really knew a lot to get.
You can only buy her vagina.

174
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.520
You gotta think about it.
There's probably

175
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.520
<v 2>some relationships out there where the woman is a bully and even less where the</v>

176
00:11:59.591 --> 00:12:03.580
woman is stronger,
but it definitely happens.
Of course it happens,

177
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:08.560
which is amazing to think about as a guy because it's almost inconceivable to

178
00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:13.300
most guys.
But it happens.
Of course.
Yeah.
She's like,

179
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:16.810
you better do this.
Better eat my pussy fucking idiot.
And he's like,

180
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.920
do it like this.
But then what can he do?

181
00:12:23.921 --> 00:12:28.900
I guess he can try to block it.
Yeah.
Oh right.
But no,
see,

182
00:12:28.901 --> 00:12:33.220
he's probably just so scared.
You could bite down there and yeah,
you could.
Ooh,

183
00:12:33.221 --> 00:12:34.400
that would hurt past.

184
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:43.120
What have you been as balls?
I think that would hurt worse.
Yeah.

185
00:12:43.121 --> 00:12:47.890
I think a ball bike might be more effective than a dick.
Bitey.
Yeah.

186
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.110
Ball bite would just shut down the whole system.

187
00:12:50.111 --> 00:12:54.490
Your whole body would just shut down.
You know what I would do?
Okay.
I would,
yeah.

188
00:12:54.491 --> 00:12:56.320
I would give in and then I would give him a,

189
00:12:56.710 --> 00:13:01.000
I might get my dick bite and a ball pole feel good.

190
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:04.750
I feel good.
I'd like that.
I wouldn't like the Dick by it,
but I'd be like,

191
00:13:04.751 --> 00:13:09.430
that ball pill.
That tug feels good.
Hug.
What if it's a full pole?
Like,

192
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:14.350
yeah,
but even that aggressive fucking Paul,
you're,
I dunno.

193
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:17.710
I would be like your like your balls licked and then you go under and be like,

194
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.640
ah,
and then you got high.
You bite one of those balls.
That's over.

195
00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.820
Then all thoughts of Rapor God.
Yeah,
that's true,
right?

196
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:27.970
All thoughts of rape are gone.

197
00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:32.080
He should be teaching her the ball by not just the Dick Bite.

198
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:36.290
Why don't we make a new video?
Nothing wrong with that.

199
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.420
Offer to lick his balls.
And then when you go in for the leg,

200
00:13:40.421 --> 00:13:43.880
he forces his penis in your mouth.
Stop Him and say,

201
00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.200
do you like having your balls?

202
00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:51.400
Then place his balls in your mouth.

203
00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:56.980
Spit a bunch on them so he thinks your game and then take a big bite.

204
00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.590
Hiring
nasty.

205
00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:06.530
We could make that video.
We'll use some peaches,
peaches to,

206
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:10.580
you know they had a cucumber.
Then
simulate.
Yeah.

207
00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:14.090
Yeah.
Do you like your balls?
Licked

208
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:20.300
your attacker?
We'll pause.
Yeah.
Wait a minute.
Hold on.
A matter of fact,

209
00:14:20.301 --> 00:14:24.680
I've never had that done before.
Could you do it real quick?
Stupid rapist.

210
00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:29.450
Stupid,
dumb rapists.
How about this?
This guy's pretty much a a rapist.

211
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:30.913
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

212
00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:42.230
<v 2>Fuck.
Is this guy talking?
I don't know,</v>

213
00:14:42.231 --> 00:14:44.960
but I mean it's like on the subway and he tells his guy.
Let me see.

214
00:14:44.961 --> 00:14:48.800
I didn't an American man.
Oh,
he was in Singapore.

215
00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.840
Is Female friend filmed this as the,

216
00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:56.090
as the Asian man reportedly kept asking him for sex.
Yeah.
I mean,

217
00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:01.790
so this is older guys on the subway and he's like,
you are gay.
Are you gay?

218
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:02.683
Yeah,

219
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.110
<v 4>I'm talking to him.
I know.
Fuck it.</v>

220
00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.150
This is my friend and you're being very rude.
Oh No,
no.
She's talking,

221
00:15:09.151 --> 00:15:12.380
I'll find I'm your friend.
Oh yeah,
no,
I want you to fuck me.
Collect.

222
00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.330
I don't know who you are.
I want you to fuck me to Max.

223
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:17.440
<v 2>Whoa.
Wow.</v>

224
00:15:17.441 --> 00:15:21.910
Very different approach and also demanding to be fucked it.

225
00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.540
That's also really interesting because you're being aggressive,

226
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.360
but you're asking for this submissive role.
Right?

227
00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:31.420
I feel like I missed the introduction here.
The introduction was this,

228
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.490
<v 4>what about Facebook?
So sorry</v>

229
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.313

230
00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:46.670
<v 2>said thing about,

you're gay,
you're gay.
I'm gay too.</v>

231
00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:50.420
And then he's like,
I'm talking to you bitch talking to him.
Oh.
And she,

232
00:15:50.421 --> 00:15:53.840
and then the boy,
the guy goes,
that's my friend.
He goes,
she,
this guy goes,

233
00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.540
that's not your friend.
I'm your friend.
And he's like,
ah,

234
00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.510
I want you to fuck me in my ass.
Yeah,

235
00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.780
<v 4>I talking to him.
I know.
Fuck it.</v>

236
00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.140
This is my friend who you're being very rude.
Oh No,
no.
She thought your friend.

237
00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.060
I'm your friend.
No,
you're not.
I want you to fuck me.
Collect.

238
00:16:09.061 --> 00:16:12.050
I don't know who you are and I'm not in.
I want you to fuck me to Max.

239
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:17.020
<v 2>Whoa.
All right.
I feel like he's just learned these phrases for his,
you know,</v>

240
00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:20.350
his pleasure.
Basically.
He doesn't speak good English,
but he's like,

241
00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.800
how do I say this?
Oh yeah,
I want you to fuck me tonight.
Pretty good.

242
00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:24.693
Pretty good at it.

243
00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:29.990
<v 4>Isa Lbgq I'm the IB nuts.
Yes,
you are your games.</v>

244
00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.000
Please leave.

245
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.620
Please don't touch me again.
Please don't touch.

246
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:39.770
We can patch you.
Hey,

247
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:46.970
<v 2>yeah.
Now,
yeah,
he should definitely dig.</v>

248
00:16:46.971 --> 00:16:50.810
Bite this old guy I know.
Or do the ball licking approach.
Yeah.

249
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.480
He should be like the guy.
She'd be like,
do you want me to do,

250
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.160
I went to to fuck with tonight.
He should go.
Do you like having your balls lick?

251
00:16:55.910 --> 00:17:00.550
And the guy's like,
what?
Yeah,
I do it.
And then he goes,
well,

252
00:17:00.551 --> 00:17:04.430
they're all a lot long licks.
All his balls,
but like for like 2030 minutes.

253
00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:09.040
And then Adam,
yes.
Wait.
Hi.

254
00:17:09.041 --> 00:17:11.870
You mean he's sharpening his knife for that long?
Well,
you got to make it.

255
00:17:11.871 --> 00:17:14.750
You got to,
you can't have him a suspect you're going to do some don't.

256
00:17:14.751 --> 00:17:18.500
So you gotta kind of get into it for a long time to get your balls lick that.

257
00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.570
Well,
I mean he's trying to convince them,
right?

258
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:24.890
Like I'm not going to do like I'm game.
That's how you lower him in.

259
00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:30.320
You spit on his dick and his balls for like 25 35 45 minutes.

260
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.340
Right.
That's what I would do.

261
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:36.440
And then when he's like really in the euphoria of it,
then you bite his balls.

262
00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:39.790
Oh,
so you really,
you're really roping him.
Yeah.

263
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:43.670
But you got to blow him and lick his balls for like an hour and a half for this

264
00:17:43.671 --> 00:17:45.980
Matt,
that door.
Yes.
To work.
This is my approach.

265
00:17:45.981 --> 00:17:50.010
This is how I train women all the time in this.
This is my very system that

266
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:54.210
<v 0>I passed.
I don't like where this is going.
What do you mean this is problematic?</v>

267
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:58.350
You're making fun of Ray?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Wait a minute,

268
00:17:58.351 --> 00:18:02.820
I'm talking about it.
The fence,
the fence system that I've developed over years.

269
00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:07.140
Oh,
are you like the sharpening the knife guru?
Yeah.
I teach this class where I,

270
00:18:07.141 --> 00:18:09.690
and I have women practice,
you know on me.
I go,

271
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.240
just put this in your mouth for like 30 to 40 minutes and,

272
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:17.940
and then when I least suspect that,
just show me your finger and that'll be a,

273
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:22.650
that'll be a signal that your mind or she has to put her finger in your bom hall

274
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:27.270
and then that's a surprise to get away from me.

275
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:31.740
Now sometimes what'll happen is I'll come to turn it during that time period and

276
00:18:31.741 --> 00:18:34.680
then I go,
now we've got to start over.
But you know,
we're getting there.

277
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:38.640
It's just,
it's a matter of practice,
practice,
practice.

278
00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:49.440
Every time I see Asian guys now,
I always assume they're showing like,
oh,

279
00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.490
we went to a Sushi bar yesterday and little Tokyo to our old stomping grounds

280
00:18:53.491 --> 00:18:55.710
around there.
And all the Sushi chefs.

281
00:18:55.711 --> 00:18:59.220
I just imagined them sharpening their knives before their shifts,
you know?

282
00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:00.900
Do you think he's sharpening his knife this morning?

283
00:19:00.901 --> 00:19:03.430
Like a hundred percent he did rob.

284
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.950
So stupid.
I don't do all Asian men do that.
That's crazy.
Rob,

285
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:18.090
rob,
all of them because of that one guy,

286
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.240
he ruined aging men for us forever.
That's great.

287
00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.310
I become racist now.
There was no racist.

288
00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.320
You're just assuming that all these guys come hard.

289
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:37.330
You're not wrong.
Invisibly come,
I think to me right there,
he tries,

290
00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:40.040
they're contracting their tech guy.

291
00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:44.130
If they're not circumscribed to circumstances,

292
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.230
not all guys are circumstances.
And then they,
uh,

293
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.860
pull the skin back and you just Jack Your Dick.
So many people,
by the way,

294
00:19:52.861 --> 00:19:53.611
I never thought this,

295
00:19:53.611 --> 00:19:57.180
but a lot of people messaged when I tweeted out the link to that video.

296
00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.380
They're like,
this guy's mentally ill.

297
00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:05.190
Most people are that we air on this shit.
Well,
mental illness,
video show.

298
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:11.340
No,
it's not.
It's are you crazy?
Come to your mom's out.
No,
that goes a bit funny.

299
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:16.000
But he's not crazy.
He's a very deliberate system.

300
00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:20.280
The same way I do with my self defense class.
Right?
Sure.
Crazy.

301
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.333
<v 4>Wonderful.</v>

302
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.950
Wow.
This lady is trying to tell him,

303
00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:45.000
<v 0>I believe she put her hands on him like that.
Not that she's wrong,</v>

304
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:50.230
but just that that's a bold move.
But I,
you're right.
You're absolutely right.

305
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:54.120
However,
to be cleared so we,
the audience understands this listening.
Uh,

306
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.620
another third party came in,
a woman,

307
00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:01.770
American woman came in and put her hands on the Asian man and like told him to

308
00:21:02.321 --> 00:21:07.300
calm down and get back.
But see,
in our world and the female world,

309
00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:11.710
a gay man,
it is equal to a woman.
Oh,
we don't think of them as dudes.

310
00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:16.330
I think they're just,
they're girls like us.
They're cheeses.
That is so offensive.

311
00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:20.890
Know it's true though.
I'm going to weep.
No,
but don't you think?

312
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.870
But see,
that guy actually took to it.
Okay.
He was like,
look,

313
00:21:24.871 --> 00:21:26.960
he says giving it to her,

314
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.480
but I can't believe he didn't push her back cause he was touching the other

315
00:21:31.481 --> 00:21:32.900
people.
That's not cool.

316
00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:37.120
Why would Yoshi demand sex from another space on the train like that?

317
00:21:37.121 --> 00:21:40.900
Isn't that Yoshi?
Come on.
Could it be him older Yoshi?

318
00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.100
Although Yo,
she's like 50 now and he looks like he's 20.
It's horrible.

319
00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:49.600
Is that possible?
I know it's not fair.
He looks really good.

320
00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.880
<v 4>Sorry.
Sorry.</v>

321
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.500
<v 0>So yeah,
so just to be clear now,</v>

322
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:19.210
the Asian man is saying there's no laws here.
Anyone can touch anybody,

323
00:22:19.211 --> 00:22:22.840
which I doubt is true in Singapore of all places.

324
00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:27.580
That is super strict.
Um,
and then she's like,
he's a gay,

325
00:22:27.581 --> 00:22:32.140
I'm a gay.
Did this happen to you when you were in Singapore?
No.
No,
no.

326
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.800
You know what I do like about,
um,
the older gays like this?

327
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:39.370
Like he really does put it out there.
Like the flag is flying and he's like,

328
00:22:39.371 --> 00:22:42.790
look man,
I want to fuck.
But at this age,
I,
I applaud that.

329
00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:45.650
You shouldn't be like that.
I agree.
Good for you.

330
00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.070
I don't like these harassing this,
this dude.

331
00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:53.020
I don't think that's something that bothered,
but
let's see if he actually,

332
00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.860
Mister Roper,
uh,
Asian.
Mr. Rowe closed the deal here.

333
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:02.000
<v 4>What's your fucking face off?</v>

334
00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:07.500
He's drunk,
right?

335
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:21.970
<v 0>Whoa.
Nuts.
They're world is fucking know.
But who,
who connected there?</v>

336
00:23:21.971 --> 00:23:26.290
Did he connect with the guy?
He had the guy that he's trying to get to fuck him.

337
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:27.680
Wow.
That was,

338
00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:29.290
<v 4>he slapped that guy's face.
I think</v>

339
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:39.860
he's holding his face.

340
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:43.520
<v 0>Just hit me.
That's what a Dick head.
Fuck.
This</v>

341
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:52.960
sexual assault episode.
What's going on?
And it comes together.

342
00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:57.840
I want you to fuck me too.
Like
what's with all the assault clip,

343
00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:01.140
whereas our other guy,

344
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:08.040
right?
One is a humble request.
The other one is a demand.

345
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.250
Keith,
you

346
00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:17.990
fucking gave fucking gay.
Yes.
You all.
Y'all gates.

347
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:23.480
He just told that dude he was,
that guy.
Didn't say anything to him.

348
00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:29.230
Our thing is real man,
but who knows if that guy really was,
who knows?
Yeah.

349
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:33.140
I don't know his female friend companion,
you know?

350
00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:37.400
But I guess she didn't say this is like my boyfriend,
my husband still.

351
00:24:37.401 --> 00:24:40.610
That guy's crazy.
So good luck to him.

352
00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.500
I hope things work out well.
Anyway,

353
00:24:45.501 --> 00:24:49.780
we were in Red Tokyo yesterday and we met him.

354
00:24:49.781 --> 00:24:52.940
Mommy on the street.
That was fun.
Yeah,
that was pretty cool.
I was like,

355
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:55.780
hey mommy's,
I'm like,
whoa.
Walking across the street.
Yeah.

356
00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:59.570
We tried to go to an awesome Sushi joint,
we ended up back at another good one.

357
00:24:59.571 --> 00:25:02.810
But yeah,
there was a line,
any line,
fuck all that.

358
00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:07.040
I'm over lines for restaurants,
America,
man,
the same Russia.

359
00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.040
I'm not doing that anymore.
Yeah,
wait,
no fucking bread lines.

360
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:13.480
I don't care what it is,
man.
There's all these,
you know,

361
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:18.490
what is it like Franklins barbecue in Austin or like Hattie's and in uh,

362
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.410
Nashville and every time I go there,

363
00:25:21.411 --> 00:25:25.370
like you got to go this place and then there's like an hour wait outside and I'm

364
00:25:25.371 --> 00:25:28.580
like,
we'll go somewhere else,
but this is awesome.
I'm like,
no,

365
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:33.010
it's not that awesome.
Same thing happened in Philly.
I went to some uh,

366
00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.730
cheese steak place and it wasn't the two big ones.
It wasn't Geno's or the one,

367
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.310
whatever it is across the street.
And the same thing.

368
00:25:40.311 --> 00:25:44.360
It's like a waited like 45 minutes or an hour to get a cheese steak.

369
00:25:44.361 --> 00:25:47.720
And then my friend was like,
how is it?
I'm like,
it's a good cheese steak.
I mean,

370
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:49.590
it tastes like a good one.
Well what,

371
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:53.240
it tastes better if you now have to wait in line for 45.
Of course,
of course men.

372
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:57.650
Uh,
I dunno,
I'm just not into it.
I'm not into it either.
Um,
I don't,

373
00:25:57.651 --> 00:26:01.160
I don't have that kind of time or patience for waiting for the patients for it.

374
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.530
I just go somewhere and we went down the street.

375
00:26:03.531 --> 00:26:06.770
Something I can do to just get this line.
No.
Okay.
I'll go somewhere else.
Well,

376
00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:09.800
they always lie to you too and they're like,
oh,
it goes by fast.

377
00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:13.010
Put your name on it.
No,
it never does.
When you're standing and you're,
I know.

378
00:26:13.011 --> 00:26:17.060
Soon as I saw that line outside for that,
for lunch at that place,
I was like,

379
00:26:17.061 --> 00:26:21.590
go fuck yourself man.
No Fuck Outta here with that shit.
Get the fuck.

380
00:26:21.591 --> 00:26:25.670
Where did we see douchebag?
Hedge Fund guy that was there.
No,

381
00:26:25.671 --> 00:26:26.960
but where did we see him again?

382
00:26:26.961 --> 00:26:30.260
Afterwards at store where I bought that shirt for a little jeans where he was

383
00:26:30.261 --> 00:26:34.250
walking out and we know that was Starbucks stocks.
We took a pee there.
Yeah.

384
00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.530
Took a pee break.
Yeah.
That dude.
Yeah,
there was so fun.

385
00:26:36.531 --> 00:26:41.010
There's like a group of the cast of billions like these days,
coast douche bags,

386
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:45.150
like white shoes.
And I it,
I'm starting to get that sadness,

387
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.990
that a series ending sadness.
I know there's like five,

388
00:26:48.991 --> 00:26:51.600
six episodes left and I'm already like,
now did they,

389
00:26:51.601 --> 00:26:54.570
are they making a season three or is it,
I don't know anything about it.

390
00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:58.260
Let's see.
Let's see if a billion,

391
00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:05.040
let's see if there's a season three and outs confirmed.
Yes.
Yes.

392
00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:10.230
It will air next year though.
Fuck mother offer at when?

393
00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:10.991
When next year.

394
00:27:10.991 --> 00:27:15.360
It doesn't say it takes so long to make my favorite TV shows.

395
00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:20.010
I wish to see it now.
This furthers my argument for starting a show.

396
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:24.950
Well after it it's a,
yeah.
Then you can binge the 10 seasons.

397
00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:28.770
I know.
Like I'm into the soprano's dude.
Yeah,
I like it.
Fucking like it.

398
00:27:28.771 --> 00:27:33.750
Like that.
It's a Zombie show.
I'm onboard.
Yeah.
Walking dead.
Game of Thrones.
Yeah.

399
00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:38.440
Um,
but what we saw at the Sushi bar was interesting.
Uh,

400
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:43.530
we saw a lot of hungry tits out and about yesterday.
No Bra,
no bra,

401
00:27:43.531 --> 00:27:45.780
which is French.
Yeah,
Teddy.
Just out.

402
00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:49.160
Just little titties does dine,

403
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:52.770
eat nine would be fed and they were just licking their lips like,

404
00:27:52.771 --> 00:27:56.850
do you got something for me?
And I tried to put my chopsticks up to her tits.

405
00:27:56.851 --> 00:28:00.450
I was like,
you want me to give a little piece stupid?
She was like,

406
00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:04.890
I feed him when I can.
But she was a French girl.

I take listener emails this week.
Uh,

458
00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:36.130
a girl wrote in asking whether or not she should reveal that her cousin is

459
00:31:36.131 --> 00:31:40.960
actually her biological sister.
Whoa.
Jerry Springer stuff.

460
00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:42.750
It's pretty exciting.
Yeah.

461
00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:47.350
Her cousin is her biological sister and the cousin doesn't know it.

462
00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:49.960
They don't know it.
No one person that knows is her mother.

463
00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:54.160
It's too much.
I know.
It's awesome.

464
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:57.320
<v 2>All right,
well there you go.
That's deep bro.</v>

465
00:31:58.660 --> 00:31:59.610
<v 0>Check it out.
Yeah.</v>

466
00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.660
<v 2>Oh mm.</v>

467
00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.690
<v 0>Uh,
yeah.
That's it,
right?
That's all we have for now.
You're one to always</v>

468
00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:10.250
<v 2>boast and brag about your h two o consumption.</v>

469
00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:11.740
Meanwhile,
you,

470
00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:16.310
you tear those down who hydrate in a different manner.

471
00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:18.740
Science has something to say to you.

472
00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:23.270
<v 5>Sure.
To wake you up.
New Research says coffee,</v>

473
00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.490
dehydrate you please.

474
00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:30.460
Researchers from Birmingham University saving perhaps of the drink are hydrating

475
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:31.210
as water

476
00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:32.043
<v 2>bullshit.</v>

477
00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:36.490
<v 0>Listen,
I don't know what kind of fake news propaganda this is.
News breaker,</v>

478
00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:37.760
whatever that is.
Hi.

479
00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:41.270
<v 5>Effect of caffeine is balanced by the amount of water and the drink.</v>

480
00:32:41.271 --> 00:32:46.271
Something that wasn't taken into account the last time done in 1928 Jesus.

481
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:50.410
Now the current study compared managed,

482
00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:54.950
drank four months of coffee versus four months of water for three days while

483
00:32:54.951 --> 00:32:56.930
eating the same food.
The results,

484
00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:00.110
a guilt free cup of morning Joe for the rest of us.

485
00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.390
<v 0>Whatever.
Just still drink water.
Of course propaganda.</v>

486
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:08.280
<v 5>About 1.6 billion cups of coffee are consumed worldwide every day.</v>

487
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.620
[inaudible] this study is sure to please the masses,

488
00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:15.040
but researchers still suggest balancing each cup with a glass of water.
Right?

489
00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:18.090
<v 0>See the why do they still,
why would they still suggest that?</v>

490
00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:21.770
Because they have to watch their backs.
You have to make sure.
Exactly.

491
00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:26.410
Because they know this is not conclusive.
This is not a conclusive study.

492
00:33:26.411 --> 00:33:30.310
They're still saying drink water in addition to otherwise they would just sell

493
00:33:30.311 --> 00:33:33.890
you a bottle is a coffee like this and they,

494
00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:38.050
and then they give marathon runners bottles of coffee.
So there you go.

495
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:40.560
It's fine.
You can drink your coffee.
All right.

496
00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:43.660
How come I'm so thirsty when I drink coffee though.
Um,

497
00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:46.720
I think it's cause you were retarded.
Oh,

498
00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:51.780
then that happens where it goes down weird and then you're thirsty.

499
00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:55.960
It's because your chromosomes are all stupid.

500
00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.890
Let's go through some special,
some title specials for you.
I'd go retarded.

501
00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:03.640
How might that was?
My teeth are still yellow right here.
There's still yellow.

502
00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:07.120
That's a good one.
Write it down.
Not Personality Champ.
No.

503
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:12.220
How about retarded comic?
I like that.
Yeah.

504
00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:16.330
How about we had some great ones yesterday.
No,
I know.
That's how it goes.

505
00:34:16.331 --> 00:34:20.890
They just suck on it.
Denver,
come,
come,
come on my sock or something like that.

506
00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:25.030
Mm.
Come on my balls.
Balls full of cum.
Yeah.

507
00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:28.810
Now that's a catchy title.
Yeah.
Um,

508
00:34:30.490 --> 00:34:35.020
let's see.
Uh,
we had some great ones.
Cheesy jokes.

509
00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:39.100
I forget it.
Just forget this.
You forget if you forget them all too though.

510
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.490
I know.
I forgot them.
Let's do some now.

511
00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:48.710
What are you leaning towards?
Come beard.
No.
What,

512
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:52.190
what rob.
Rob.
Rob.
Yeah.
I liked that one.

513
00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:57.650
Sharpening the knife.
Just glassing.
Just glassine that's a good title actually.

514
00:34:57.651 --> 00:35:02.540
No,
it doesn't matter that my special,
my hours.
Not about that.

515
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.110
Like comedy titles.
You want those two word in three word titles.
You know,

516
00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.890
those are the ones,
the,
those are the best ones.

517
00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:14.520
Plus it's a shout out to all your mind out to the podcast.
It's um,

518
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:19.070
it's great key art for the,
like the,
the cover and stuff.
It's like a,

519
00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:23.960
he's hold and like kind of coyly.

520
00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:30.350
It's stupid.
And it,
but that's the thing.
It can be stupid.
It's a standup special.

521
00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:31.940
Yeah.
It's supposed to be silly.
Yeah.

522
00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:35.750
I mean you could call it sharpening the knife.
I like that too.
Yeah,

523
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:39.780
that's actually a really good,
uh,
it's,
but it,
you know,

524
00:35:39.781 --> 00:35:43.890
it's obviously a joke.
I mean,
you can take that seriously and be like,

525
00:35:43.891 --> 00:35:48.880
I'm sharpening my joke instrument.
I'm killing it or something silly.

526
00:35:48.881 --> 00:35:52.800
Yeah.
But I mean jokingly sharpening the knife is funny.

527
00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:57.280
I think it should be the title and I am sharpening the knife,
you know?
Uh,

528
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:02.380
metaphorically metaphor.
Right.
So what about um,

529
00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:05.130
uh,
jokes for Moose Soup?

530
00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:06.763
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

531
00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:10.870
<v 0>what about fuck me in my ass,
man.
Hey,
that's a title.</v>

532
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.150
It's my favorite.

533
00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:21.520
What about Thomson Garage then the title is Tom or black.
That's good.

534
00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:23.980
You get that.
Then you get different audience.

535
00:36:23.981 --> 00:36:25.630
That demographic's changed a little bit.

536
00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:27.213
<v 6>Yup.</v>

537
00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:32.860
<v 0>How about,
um,
how about 50 inches?</v>

538
00:36:32.861 --> 00:36:36.710
Press nine inches and price changes.

539
00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.000
Press nine inches and

540
00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:47.290
yeah.
How does my asshole smell?
That's a good title.
Nailed it.

541
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:51.340
How does my asshole smell?
Huh?
Put the hot in there.
Uh,

542
00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:55.530
not all Nazis are bad.
They would.

543
00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:01.240
What about the other side guys?
That could be,
that could be a title.

544
00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:05.710
It's a funny title.
Nazi's are bad.
Yeah.
How about instead of Neo Nazis,

545
00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:09.340
it's nifty Nazis or something like that.

546
00:37:09.341 --> 00:37:14.290
Like how about this?
Something Nazis.
I'm Sigora silly Nazi.

547
00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:18.510
Silly Nazi.
That's a pretty funny title.
Yeah.

548
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:24.130
That's just a fun one.
Or just tell him,
Hey Hitler.
Hey Hitler.

549
00:37:24.131 --> 00:37:27.280
Yeah,
I mean that's a whole new,
you're really,

550
00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.420
you're really not even the net for the,

551
00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:33.850
I think the conversation would go with the breaking it down.
Like,

552
00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:38.590
so here's what I want to do.
They're like,
no,
no,

553
00:37:38.591 --> 00:37:40.900
we don't get it.
It's like a shadow.
You don't get it.

554
00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:45.880
You get all aggressive and they're like,
oh,
it's not really about Hitler.

555
00:37:45.881 --> 00:37:50.410
It's about this girl in the video about my list you guys are doing.

556
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:55.690
How about I like that.
You're doing good.
Doing good.
Well,

They wouldn't go for that

558
00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:05.770
or you guys are doing good.
You're doing good.

But see that would work better for you.

561

Just glass and just glass is a great title.
Yeah.

573
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:10.810
I love you guys.

Glassine right in and let us know if you think that's a good time.

575
00:39:13.511 --> 00:39:17.890
We should put up a poll actually.

Would you marry your mom?

582
00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:41.220
Would you ever date your mom asked him,
will you ever date your mom?

583
00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:46.380
It's a good title.
I would date my mom.
That's my title.
I asked,

584
00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:48.770
I asked.
It's just like the gays

585
00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:56.180
for foreign obviously a definitely good comedy title for real is when,

586
00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:59.220
you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

587
00:39:59.221 --> 00:40:01.460
That's a good time comedy title cause you're talking to me.

588
00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:05.160
You know it has to be a play on it though.
Yeah.
Like you know,
uh,

589
00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:07.930
I don't know what the play is,
but they can't just give a fuck about none of

590
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:13.770
that was the best one.
Ms. Powell was in here and you played for and she's like,

591
00:40:13.771 --> 00:40:16.890
you always do the best you make fun of black men.
No,
she goes,

592
00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:20.280
I love your imitation.
Yeah.
Cause your invitation of pipe that goes,

593
00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:24.660
not an invitation.
Yeah.
Hang on.
So disrespectful.

594
00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:29.220
All my Kolbe Stroud go oral or come for arc.

595
00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:34.380
How about Ooh,
I got another,

596
00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:38.850
Are you ready for it?
Yeah.
Okay.
Hold on.
This is a,

597
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:43.110
uh,
I don't see it.
This would be so good.
Fuck.

598
00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:47.760
You guys are doing it's rub,
rub,
rub,
rub,
rub,
rub.
No,

599
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:52.240
I think it's just glassing are feeling what?

600
00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.720
You feel me all the time out and I was that my me.

601
00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:56.540
You don't tell me if you know what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying.

602
00:40:56.550 --> 00:41:01.400
That's a good one.
It's funny.
Yeah.
Eh.

603
00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:06.240
How about Oh,
here it is.
Ready?
Yeah.
This is the title comes up on your screen.

604
00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:07.440
Tom Cigarette

605
00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:10.300
<v 7>man.
I am the king of in province for,
for you</v>

606
00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:16.690
<v 0>the king of Improv.
Improv.
I like that.
About the king of standup.
The king of,</v>

607
00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:19.750
yeah.
See I could be the king of Con,
but then there's the kings of comedy.

608
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:23.350
Awesome title.
So it's a brand.

609
00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:26.770
It's so brash and I would get so much hate people like a cap of Levy.

610
00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.640
So crazy title.
You think we actually have to pause for a moment.
Press pause.

611
00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:34.190
We have to press pause with her to cat cvas and

612
00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:38.840
<v 2>their business call.
Yeah.
Do our little business call.
We'll be right back.
Well,</v>

613
00:41:38.841 --> 00:41:40.880
you won't even know.
I don't know what I'm saying.
We'll be right back.

614
00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:44.990
Welcome back.
We're back.
We'll have seven.
Seven.

615
00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:49.350
<v 3>Okay.</v>

616
00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:53.640
<v 0>Some interesting emails came in.
Drew birds are hot farts smell year.</v>

617
00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:55.290
Oh Wow.
Hey Mama

618
00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:59.050
<v 2>TV last night came across a question that needs immediate attention.</v>

619
00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:04.680
I was on the couch next to my nonbinary spouse when I had two f a r t upon

620
00:42:05.141 --> 00:42:08.500
release I noticed the started only hot nature of the gas.
Yeah.

621
00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:12.670
It happened to be particularly smelly and I pondered what the connection of heat

622
00:42:12.671 --> 00:42:15.310
to smell is.
Our farts that come out hot,

623
00:42:15.311 --> 00:42:18.600
more smelly and what causes the heat sensation.
Wow.

624
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:21.010
I knew I had to come to my main mommy's to get to the bottom of this.

625
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:23.560
I will see you at wet balls beach for the live show.

626
00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:28.600
I called ahead to make sure that have moose soup ready.
Well.

627
00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:32.380
Interesting question and I feel like medically we need to,

628
00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:36.460
I think we need to reach out to a professional to get real guidance on that.

629
00:42:36.461 --> 00:42:40.000
But I definitely have had that thought like,
wow,

630
00:42:40.001 --> 00:42:41.950
this is hot and it doesn't smell good.

631
00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:43.870
<v 0>No.
And I think,</v>

632
00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:49.390
I think you're right that the hot farts do tend to as be smellier.
Yeah.

633
00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:53.950
And I think it has something to do with the molecules being heated up.
F a.
R.

634
00:42:53.951 --> 00:42:58.900
T it's you know why?
Okay,
think about it.
When you cook food in the microwave,

635
00:42:58.901 --> 00:43:03.490
the molecules bounce around and the smell emanates right because of the heat.

636
00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:06.250
But why is it hot and why is it coming out of your head that now?

637
00:43:06.251 --> 00:43:10.810
That's another question that,
I mean,

638
00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.880
why are there hot farts?
I Dunno.

639
00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:16.600
I feel like this is one of the great life aren't great mysteries of life.

640
00:43:16.601 --> 00:43:18.970
Like do twins have identical dicks?

641
00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:23.770
This one of those questions of why are they hotter?
I Dunno.

642
00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:28.110
So far on the identical Dicks,
we've kind of come to the conclusion

643
00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:32.680
<v 2>that identical twins seemed to have identical dicks,</v>

644
00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:35.470
but fraternal twins don't necessarily,
which makes sense.
Yeah.

645
00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:39.970
<v 0>Oh yes,
yes.
We were back to this.
This is how I'm straight.
Yeah,
so let's,</v>

646
00:43:39.971 --> 00:43:42.970
let's go down the list of things that give you hot parts.
Number one,
Broccoli.

647
00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:46.720
Yeah,
a dried apricots.
Give me hot farts.

648
00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:48.140
<v 3>Okay.</v>

649
00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:51.500
<v 0>Ethnic food,
Kimchi.</v>

650
00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:56.270
[inaudible] now you know what they have in common.
What high fiber content.

651
00:43:56.390 --> 00:44:00.440
There you go.
Bell peppers.
High fiber fiber makes it hotter now.

652
00:44:00.441 --> 00:44:05.300
But why this fiber translate to heat in your bum hall?
It's a great question.

653
00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:06.530
Why is it a five?
I don't know.

654
00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:10.550
<v 2>These are,
there's a lot of mysteries out there that you know,
I dunno.</v>

655
00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.150
<v 0>Yeah.
Okay,
so if you're a medical professional,</v>

656
00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:17.750
let us know why side we parts are hot wire farts,
sometimes hot.

657
00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:20.030
Why our heart hot farts?

658
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:24.290
Smellier while we decide I know why they're smelly or because they're hot and

659
00:44:24.291 --> 00:44:27.530
therefore the molecules are bouncing around.
That's your theory.
You said,

660
00:44:27.531 --> 00:44:31.290
I know that's what creates smell,
but you're saying you don't know that for sure,

661
00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:32.160
right?
Theory.
Yeah,

662
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:35.790
<v 2>but I'm saying like,
let's get it confirmed.
Seventh Grade Science Knowledge.</v>

663
00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:40.470
That's good.
A confirmed man.
God,
I never,
and isn't that amazing?

664
00:44:40.471 --> 00:44:44.940
You go through your whole life just accepting that as a given and then one day

665
00:44:44.941 --> 00:44:48.280
somebody just challenges your whole way of being.
You feel that he'd come on,

666
00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:51.180
you're like,
oh man.
And if you're in public,
he would look around like,
oh,

667
00:44:51.181 --> 00:44:55.770
this is going to hit somebody he didn't know before.
You know before when that,

668
00:44:55.830 --> 00:45:00.630
when that gas is cooking,
when it's really hot stoves on,
Ooh,

669
00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:04.950
it's going to stink.
Like yesterday I was eating a bowl of my own soup,

670
00:45:04.951 --> 00:45:05.580
not Moosup,

671
00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:09.540
just veggie soup and I thought I shouldn't have a second bowl because it's going

672
00:45:09.541 --> 00:45:14.010
to make a lot of hot farts and I didn't want to punish you and bed.

673
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:17.430
And then there's like,
you know with noisy ones it's here.
There you go.

674
00:45:17.431 --> 00:45:22.210
Like this is loud maybe.
And then you go,
oh,
nothing could go either way.

675
00:45:22.211 --> 00:45:25.860
It could go either way.
Sometimes I'll even let out a fart during a massage.

676
00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:30.180
How sphincter control if the control is there.
Yeah,

677
00:45:30.181 --> 00:45:34.200
because I know like it can't smell that like that bad sometimes,

678
00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:37.580
but sometimes can't you feel that this one would smell if I let it out?
Yes.

679
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:38.850
Those are the hot ones.

680
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:43.170
You know they're hot before they even come out until you're like,

681
00:45:43.171 --> 00:45:47.730
this is gonna be a hot.
Sometimes you go,
Ooh,
that'd be
amazing.

682
00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:53.160
Cause you feel the,
the Gurgles,
you know the cramping that goes with it.
Yeah.

683
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:54.091
Dear Mommy's,

684
00:45:54.091 --> 00:45:56.730
in recent podcasts you were playing the clip of the mother and son who were

685
00:45:56.731 --> 00:46:01.050
dating their behavior can be explained by genetic sexual attraction.

686
00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:05.510
GSA is an overwhelming sexual attraction that may develop between clothes bought

687
00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:10.520
blood relatives who first meet as adults and that could very well happen.

688
00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:16.210
Could have been what happened to those two.
Right.
Had that,
that thing of like,
uh,

689
00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:19.050
seemed like they didn't grow up together.
She didn't raise him.

690
00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:20.760
She may have birthed him.
It didn't raise,

691
00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:23.750
have a college friend of mine was adopted as a baby.
After College.

692
00:46:23.751 --> 00:46:27.720
He sought out her birth family and found her mother and two brothers during

693
00:46:27.721 --> 00:46:28.201
counseling.

694
00:46:28.201 --> 00:46:32.460
She was warned about genetic sexual attraction is thought that occurs because

695
00:46:32.461 --> 00:46:36.360
the normal sibling,
parental bonding doesn't occur during childhood.

696
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:40.160
Supposedly.
It's rare.
I'm beginning to wonder Ben,

697
00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:42.780
I think that's a really interesting email.
Absolutely.

698
00:46:42.781 --> 00:46:43.830
So what's happening is like,

699
00:46:43.831 --> 00:46:48.180
because of the lack of that bonding between siblings and or parents,

700
00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:52.330
something that happens when you meet them for the first time as adults and

701
00:46:52.331 --> 00:46:56.350
you're,
you're,
you're trying to,
you know,
figure out or,
or,

702
00:46:56.420 --> 00:47:00.870
or let the bonding occur and it turns into sexual energy because it's not,

703
00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:05.160
it's not dispersed naturally through raising that is fast.

704
00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:06.020
You know what I read today,

705
00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:09.780
my shrink's office is why people are attracted to each other.
Just like the gays,

706
00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:12.900
like sexual partners,
not related people.

707
00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:17.490
And they say that you're attracted to people that look like you.
Really?
Yeah.

708
00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:19.920
Like it's unconscious where they have similar features.

709
00:47:19.921 --> 00:47:24.660
And if you look at the two of us,
both of us have big lips.
I have beautiful eyes.

710
00:47:24.661 --> 00:47:29.000
Years are kind of bulging like faiths,
but we have similar,
uh,
you know,

711
00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:32.530
the dark baggy under eye circles and I mean,

712
00:47:32.531 --> 00:47:37.180
our kid looks you have a nice penis,
your penis is enormous.
Like,
yeah.

713
00:47:37.181 --> 00:47:39.820
They say that you look for people that look similar to you,

714
00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:43.790
but there's a lot of people that consciously,
I don't know.
I don't,
yeah,

715
00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:48.280
of course.
Of course there are.
Yeah,
of course.
Yeah.
But of course,

716
00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:51.310
I wonder about that.
Do you think we saw each other out for that?

717
00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:55.990
It's unconscious.
I think you,
you connect sexually with people too,

718
00:47:55.991 --> 00:48:00.250
when like in a more deep way now,
obviously like just a one night stand way.

719
00:48:00.251 --> 00:48:05.251
But when you're attracted to somebody that you share it psychological things

720
00:48:05.411 --> 00:48:07.090
with Oh yeah.
I think it's,

721
00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:11.680
it's a total meshing of our unconscious is bullshit or issues.

722
00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:16.840
Definitely.
It's all,
it's all mommy did that I see clearly now.
Yeah,
yeah,

723
00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:21.250
yeah,
yeah,
definitely.
Yeah.
You and I,

724
00:48:21.251 --> 00:48:24.010
that's why we work well together.
I think there really,

725
00:48:24.011 --> 00:48:25.300
it was just like the case we really,

726
00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.550
we have such a good unconscious pairing.
Yeah.

727
00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:34.360
It's our issues that we kind of Meld together nicely.
You know,

728
00:48:34.361 --> 00:48:38.850
when it comes to dad boners um,
a lot of people,
we've,

729
00:48:38.851 --> 00:48:42.430
we've pointed out that there's two types of dad boners there's,

730
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:46.450
there's the real,

731
00:48:46.451 --> 00:48:50.140
the true dad boner who's excited for something and not excitable.

732
00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:52.930
Then we call it the justified dad boner.

733
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:55.420
And that is somebody who's super excited about something.

734
00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:59.990
But there's reason to be and that one is,
is,
uh,
is,

735
00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:04.210
is there's more reason to celebrate and we shouldn't,
you know,

736
00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:09.010
those are the ones that we not along to like,
yeah,
I see why you're this excited.

737
00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:13.210
We have one of those today.
It is a dad boner for sure,

738
00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:17.230
but it's justified as Boehner is there for a reason.

739
00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:21.100
And I would be this excited to check out what this boner does.
He's,

740
00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:24.840
he's doing like Frisbee golf and a Frisbee Golf,

741
00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:29.860
throwing a Frisbee on the course,
trying to get to a target.

742
00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:33.050
But he's really,
I mean this is,

743
00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:36.100
I dunno how far away you would say this is that Frisbee Shit.

744
00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:42.900
Look at this.
Look how far that white people are,
his recipes.

745
00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:46.450
It feels like it's fucking 80 yards away.
It so far,

746
00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:49.750
far away then

747
00:49:56.110 --> 00:50:00.160
that's a real fucking of that.
That was a really good throw.

748
00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:03.820
I mean look how far away that is.
I know why people love playing Frisbee,

749
00:50:03.821 --> 00:50:04.654
don't they?

750
00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:08.410
They have like ultimate frisbee leagues and Dumb Shit like that around fucking

751
00:50:08.411 --> 00:50:11.530
Frisbee and your white people too much time on their hands.

752
00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:16.300
You know they either march with the Tiki torches or throw a frisbee.
Right.

753
00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:20.470
You got to keep white people occupied.
He was real excited.

754
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:25.120
But I understand that level cause I mean that is,
look how far away this

755
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:31.820
feels like it's a God damn football field.

756
00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:35.060
<v 3>Oh my God.</v>

757
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:43.140
<v 2>He imagine like how much better it is that it's recorded to that guy.</v>

758
00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:45.310
Otherwise you just like,
remember when I did that and do it right?

759
00:50:45.311 --> 00:50:48.770
Well whatever dad did you really do it?
What?
Yeah,

760
00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:53.100
I didn't know people even did this.
Yeah,
this is so weird.

761
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:57.090
The frisbee golf.
Yeah,
that's a fucking course.

762
00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:00.240
Like two of the most boring sports put together in one thing.

763
00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:05.440
<v 3>I know I'm trying,
I wish I could get into golf.
It just takes too long to play.</v>

764
00:51:05.441 --> 00:51:09.370
It's like a four hour commitment.
That's half your fucking day.
A lot of times.

765
00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.380
How do people have time for

766
00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:13.920
<v 2>golf?
I want to have,
I dunno,
I've,</v>

767
00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:18.970
I fantasize about about being in the culture of it just because I feel like

768
00:51:20.321 --> 00:51:23.800
it's,
it'd be,
it's fun way to unwind.
It's a,

769
00:51:23.801 --> 00:51:26.050
it's hanging out basically is what it is.
Yeah.

770
00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.090
You're hanging out with your friends.
Yeah.

771
00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:32.140
I don't know if I could get into it though.
I did it.
Uh,
20 years ago.

772
00:51:32.350 --> 00:51:34.110
I played regularly for one summer,

773
00:51:34.111 --> 00:51:37.840
so the summer after my freshman year in college,

774
00:51:37.841 --> 00:51:41.410
my parents lived on a golf course,
so I came home.

775
00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:45.280
I had a job where I could set my own hours,
so I would just,

776
00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:48.880
I just took up golf and I was taking lessons and that was playing,

777
00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:53.430
playing pretty regularly and I enjoyed it.
You or are you good at it?
I got to,

778
00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:57.040
I got to respectable.
I got to the point where my great fear,

779
00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:01.930
it's almost like flying with the,
with our son was that when I was,

780
00:52:02.050 --> 00:52:05.020
when I was playing before that and when I was on the driving range,

781
00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:08.920
I was terrible and I was embarrassed to join,
uh,

782
00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:12.280
like a twosome they call it or a for something like a group to play golf.

783
00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:17.800
And then I played so much that summer that by like midsummer,
I was,

784
00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:20.380
I could play a respectable round meeting.
I,
you know,

785
00:52:20.381 --> 00:52:24.880
I could hit the ball without it,
uh,
hooking or shanking and,
and,
and,

786
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:29.470
and error going four feet instead of,
you know,
a hundred yards.
So I just got,

787
00:52:29.471 --> 00:52:32.950
I got a,
uh,
I mean I was not good,
but I was enough.

788
00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:37.850
I was decent enough to join a game of golf and play and,
and again there.

789
00:52:38.010 --> 00:52:38.471
Yeah,
yeah.

790
00:52:38.471 --> 00:52:43.471
But then I went back to college and I remember I didn't play for like six months

791
00:52:43.931 --> 00:52:47.110
or something.
And then somebody who was like,
you don't play golf today.
I go,
sure.

792
00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:51.730
We went out there and men,
I shit the bed so bad.
And then it just,

793
00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:55.690
it was a discouraging.
It was just,
you know,
I was like,
oh,
I suck at this.
I said,

794
00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:58.840
well,
it's a,
it's an older,
isn't it an kind of an older guys?
I mean,

795
00:52:58.841 --> 00:53:03.400
it's definitely a bigger,
for sure amongst older guys,
but it is like a,
you know,

796
00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:08.410
the thing that I like about golf is that it takes you to destinations.

797
00:53:08.951 --> 00:53:09.371
In other words,

798
00:53:09.371 --> 00:53:13.870
you'll end up checking out places you wouldn't because it has a golf as a

799
00:53:13.871 --> 00:53:17.440
destination and it's the hang.
It's like,
oh,

800
00:53:17.441 --> 00:53:21.520
I could call somebody up.
What are you doing today?
Let's go play golf up,

801
00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:26.280
go there and broke down.
Now is there any athletic ability

802
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:29.300
<v 0>required to play golf?
Can you stand right,</v>

803
00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:34.050
that's what I'm saying.
Those guys don't really look good.
Well,

804
00:53:34.051 --> 00:53:38.010
it's not a word unless her tiger,
you know,
I mean,

805
00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:43.680
it's not,
you can be a piece of shit and you can be a fat fuck like bowling too.

806
00:53:43.681 --> 00:53:46.290
It doesn't require it.
Do you have that joke that joke about it?

807
00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:50.370
What is it that the term,
the triple crown of Lazy Darts.

808
00:53:50.371 --> 00:53:54.280
Bowling and golf.
Yeah.

809
00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:59.880
Bowling,
I forget.
You can be a fat fuck and still be in that.
You can,

810
00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:01.260
yeah.
No,
I wouldn't do it.

811
00:54:01.261 --> 00:54:05.170
It's not like a sport that I'm picking you up to stay in shape.
It was yet.

812
00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:07.830
I think that's the problem.
That's it.
I mean,

813
00:54:07.831 --> 00:54:12.240
even theoretically with golf for me is that it requires no physical ability.

814
00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:16.560
It's a huge time suck.
You're out in the sun,
get you fucking burned.

815
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:19.530
It's expensive.
The reason that it's not for me,

816
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:21.810
the people chase the dragon though.

817
00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:26.820
Cause that is what happens is it's,
it's very,
it's difficult,
right?

818
00:54:26.850 --> 00:54:31.850
It takes an incredible amount of skill and so you have a good shot or a good

819
00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:36.330
hole and then you go,
oh,
that was fucking awesome.

820
00:54:36.331 --> 00:54:41.190
Like I had a Birdie,
you know,
I went under par.
I,
I,
I did really well.

821
00:54:41.191 --> 00:54:45.690
That and then that fee,
that's the feeling you're chasing,
right?
Doing well.

822
00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.120
I like the,
I like miniature golf.

823
00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:53.910
It's also very challenging.
Yes.
That's fun.
Yeah,
it's fun.
Yeah.

824
00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:59.010
That's good to do that.
I don't think he would like actual golf.
I've only ever,

825
00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:02.760
no,
I've never played.
But you never know.
You actually never,

826
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.110
you could go out into a driving range,
have somebody show you how to do it,

827
00:55:07.111 --> 00:55:10.230
and then you could just,
you could be somebody that has like a natural skill.

828
00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:16.020
I doubtful.
Okay.
No,
it's definitely doubtful.
Hold on.

829
00:55:16.021 --> 00:55:20.430
I'm deaf in one ear here.
Brace yourself.
Fix it.

830
00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:26.030
Fix it.
Let's see.
Hello?
Hello.
Still Fuck.

831
00:55:26.031 --> 00:55:30.660
OCTA.
No,
so for cocktail,

832
00:55:30.661 --> 00:55:31.141
it's weird.

833
00:55:31.141 --> 00:55:34.320
It just happened when we came back from our call and it's definitely not here.

834
00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:38.370
It's in.
I'll fix it later.
It's fine for now.

835
00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:43.920
Well,
I dunno,
we'll I pick up golf.
I don't know.
Maybe when you're all,

836
00:55:43.921 --> 00:55:46.920
I mean I get it when you're old because then you got,
if you're retired,
perfect,

837
00:55:47.070 --> 00:55:49.620
you got nothing but time hanging out with your friends.

838
00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:51.450
You don't need to have a lot of ability.

839
00:55:51.451 --> 00:55:55.120
It's definitely an older man's gentlemen,
Jasmine Jackson,

840
00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:58.410
my Cantonese boy,
gen to me as a dancer.

841
00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:03.480
Another great blind question came in.
I love these.

842
00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:06.960
I love these so much.
I know,

860
00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:13.930
So here is the question.
You have trouble with that one?
Yeah,

861
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:16.660
I can hear it crackling in the right.
It's so something's wrong.

862
00:57:16.661 --> 00:57:19.240
And only doing one year and I switched headphones too,

863
00:57:19.241 --> 00:57:23.320
so we'll figure it out later.
Okay.
We'll do blind people masturbate too.

864
00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:24.150
Oh my God.

865
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:28.630
He's been listening to your educational podcast for quite a while now and I

866
00:57:28.631 --> 00:57:31.900
really appreciate you tackling all these hot button issues.

867
00:57:32.350 --> 00:57:36.550
The major networks are afraid to touch on the topic of blind people.

868
00:57:36.551 --> 00:57:39.010
I couldn't help but wonder about their porn preferences.

869
00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:44.440
Do Blind people just listen to the audio?
Why they pound off an or a DJ?
The bean,

870
00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:48.910
I know they make movies and TV with audio description for the blind that

871
00:57:48.911 --> 00:57:51.250
describes what is happening over top of the audio.

872
00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:55.030
Do they make porn for the blind and the describes what is happening in the
scene.

873
00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:58.870
Also,
I don't know anyone that watches the full scene.

874
00:57:58.871 --> 00:58:01.780
It doesn't just skip around to the good parts.
How to blind people.

875
00:58:01.781 --> 00:58:06.160
Skip to just the bits they want to hear.
I anxiously await your answer.

876
00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:10.300
Thank you for keeping me in the know every Wednesday.
Tyler from Cincinnati.

877
00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:15.050
Really great question,
Tyler.
Um,

878
00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:19.560
first of all,
we actually did play a,

879
00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:23.470
a blind porn chlorine for the blind.

880
00:58:23.471 --> 00:58:27.740
So somebody describes it to the blind person,
but he's saying how do,

881
00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:30.700
how do they skip ahead?
I mean,
I guess that's just what they do.

882
00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:35.100
I feel like you did something to me now.
Oh really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I got to stop this.

883
00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:40.350
Okay.
Now it's back to normal.
It is happening.
I Dunno.

884
00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:44.780
I Dunno.
Well,
I'm deaf in one ear.
You're definitely year.
Okay.

885
00:58:45.590 --> 00:58:48.200
Did you try moving your mic cable?
Mm.

886
00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:52.770
Cause when I don't unplug it moving and then how would I move it if,

887
00:58:52.771 --> 00:58:56.510
I don't know,
cause I moved mine,
it popped back in.
Oh,

888
00:58:57.220 --> 00:59:02.140
that's okay.
I'll figure it out later.
I can survive.
Um,
let's see.

889
00:59:02.530 --> 00:59:04.150
I feel like that,
did we,

890
00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:07.920
can I tell you one thing that our trainer told me that is very,

891
00:59:07.921 --> 00:59:09.060
it's been upsetting me.

892
00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:14.280
She says she has a friend who has the toto washlet.
Yeah.

893
00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:17.940
But her model flushes itself.

894
00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:22.160
When she told me they have a,
that flushes for

895
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:25.700
<v 0>them.
I felt like we were the poorest people ever.
Yeah.
I know.
We don't have that.</v>

896
00:59:25.790 --> 00:59:30.350
I feel like a peasant now.
So the toilet flushes by itself.
Yes.
Yeah.

897
00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:35.160
That's um,
not what we have.
No,
I have to flush and I feel like I'm a poor person.

898
00:59:35.161 --> 00:59:35.994
Why don't we have that?

899
00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:37.073
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

900
00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:39.670
<v 2>What have you done today?
What did you do to this?</v>

901
00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:41.830
Why did you ruin everything today?

902
00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:50.690
<v 0>Why did you do that?
I did nothing.
You did?
I did nothing to your rigid.</v>

903
00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:54.230
God dammit.
What's wrong now I'm hearing weird shit.

904
00:59:54.231 --> 00:59:57.170
Now that you keep fucking with the headphone Jack Abusive.
You are.

905
00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:00.140
How has that abusive so mean?
How was that mean?

906
01:00:00.790 --> 01:00:05.430
I get like a gag that day.
That is accurate.
That's your,

907
01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:09.540
you're the Goonies lady right now.
Ah,
man.
You ruin.
I know it's mine.

908
01:00:09.541 --> 01:00:11.670
It's crackling too.
I didn't read it.

909
01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:15.540
<v 2>All right,
so let's see if this is a,</v>

910
01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:21.660
<v 6>something that could play a</v>

911
01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.190
porn for the blind.

912
01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.270
I don't know if this is a real one or not.

913
01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:32.740
<v 8>To engaging in various sexual scenarios.
Flash in quick succession.
Yeah.</v>

914
01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:36.250
So somebody dictating to her,
kneeling on the green,
gray shag carpet,

915
01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:40.120
walking onto a sties,
giving him a round of blow job.
There you go.

916
01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:42.550
And then kisses the head of his penis as he rubs it along.

917
01:00:42.551 --> 01:00:47.380
Her left breast is now standing over her as she lays on the cushions of a dark

918
01:00:47.381 --> 01:00:50.800
green couch holding up her pants,
pants between them.

919
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:56.270
<v 2>So it's morning for the blind.
I,
that's it.
How do you fast forward through that?</v>

920
01:00:56.271 --> 01:00:59.360
You just fast,
fast forward.
Yeah.
You just scroll forward and then usually like,

921
01:00:59.361 --> 01:01:02.510
well,
what's going on now?
You know,
10 of them.
Both of them.

922
01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:08.300
She's fingering herself.
Oh my God.
This coming on her ass.
There you go.

923
01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:12.470
That's a part I wanted.
Oh,
I mean that's it.

924
01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:16.400
That's exactly what we were talking about.
Right.
Scrolls forward.
What's that?

925
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:22.490
So good job.
Good job making that porn.
But I guess that is,

926
01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:25.460
you know,
that is real porn or,
yeah,

927
01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:29.530
<v 0>I guess so.
I guess they have to use their imagination and</v>

928
01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:31.473
<v 6>yeah.</v>

929
01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:37.020
<v 2>Otherwise you've just listened to the Yoh ruins porn a lot.
It's the porn music.</v>

930
01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:38.691
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

931
01:01:38.691 --> 01:01:43.250
I think what ruins porn for me too is all the scenarios and the bill that like

932
01:01:43.251 --> 01:01:46.440
just go to the bag and you like that guns out.
Just get in there.
I mean,

933
01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:49.930
I'm not going to watch plot.
Are you not at all watch?
No.
No.

934
01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:54.080
Sometimes I don't care.
You don't.
You don't like a,
Oh shit,
I missed the bus.

935
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:56.960
No,
I mean it's not like I'm,

936
01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:01.580
I'm really pleased with myself when I'm doing that,
so I'm like,

937
01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:05.240
just get in,
get out.
What you're upset with yourself for?
Just checking it out.

938
01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:08.960
Well,
I'm not,
I'm not in a good place if I'm new.
You know what I mean?
Wow.

939
01:02:08.961 --> 01:02:13.190
Really that,
that's,
that's really harsh though on yourself,
is it?
I think so.

940
01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.140
To be like I'm not in a good place.
Well,

941
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:17.420
I guess I just want to get in and get out.

942
01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:19.920
I'm not really looking to spend a lot of time in that neighbor.

943
01:02:19.921 --> 01:02:22.530
How much time did you,
did you try to spend there when you do go there?

944
01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.660
I don't know.
I don't time myself,

945
01:02:24.661 --> 01:02:29.370
but I definitely don't want to like lounge and put my feet up and really,

946
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:32.700
and the terror that I thought that there was the only way to do that.

947
01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:35.610
I thought it was like get comfortable.
You have your drink,

948
01:02:35.611 --> 01:02:38.570
you have something to eat.
You're like,
you know,
let's get,

949
01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:40.650
just try and get through 30 of these and like the most,

950
01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:45.030
I don't have that kind of time.
I know I don't do that.
Okay.

951
01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:49.320
Not Interested and usually it's such a vulgar area.

952
01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:53.700
Even in the neighborhood is so dark.
No stills are like cream pie,

953
01:02:53.701 --> 01:02:57.180
double fist,
anal.
Finally.
I don't want any of that.
Just give me normal.

954
01:02:57.230 --> 01:03:01.470
Whereas like the normal section,
normal section,
shut that shit down.

955
01:03:01.471 --> 01:03:02.520
I don't want to see that at all.

956
01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:08.450
I want to see what do you like prolapsed Colin's six Dick's stuff.

957
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:16.500
That's just crazy.
Yeah,
it's too crazy.
That's what I'm saying.

958
01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:20.790
I think it's not that I'm so ashamed myself.
More so that the neighbor,

959
01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:25.800
it's so crazy just to find like an relatively tame clip.

960
01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:31.650
Do you know what I mean?
I'm not into the six guy prolapse.
Colin,

961
01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:35.730
why anal fisting double fuck t you know what's wrong with you?

962
01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:41.520
It just normal stuff's exciting enough for me personally.
Just guy,
girl,

963
01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:45.090
just five,
five portering guys and two girls.

964
01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:48.670
<v 9>12 strong and durable.
Resistant to terrorists.
Drape,</v>

965
01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:50.470
swell resistant.

966
01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:54.140
Her Nan is a type of 12th in jeans.

967
01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:56.420
The smoother side she used as the front.

968
01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:00.920
Typically the vertical warp behinds are dyed blue and the weft yarn is left

969
01:04:00.921 --> 01:04:03.530
natural.
There you go.

970
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:07.440
<v 0>See if it didn't have denim,
I'd be much more board.
Yeah,</v>

971
01:04:07.550 --> 01:04:12.150
but we have a little denim.
So Denim is the right way to go.
Um,

972
01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:14.040
how you feel about this?

973
01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:18.240
<v 9>Hello everybody,
this chick in Lawrence today.</v>

974
01:04:18.241 --> 01:04:22.830
I'm going to do a urine for the first time.

975
01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:26.510
<v 0>First Time.
Oh,
we've had her before.</v>

976
01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:29.300
She Drinks Her pee to help her fight colds.

977
01:04:30.010 --> 01:04:30.843
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

978
01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:36.500
<v 0>Yeah,
she does.
And we've,
we've shown her doing it before.
She looks</v>

979
01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:40.430
<v 9>better than during the day.
I have collected my urine</v>

980
01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:47.980
and it just poured one court into my animal bucket above me.

981
01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:53.630
<v 0>Neat.
Neat.
Oh,
she does actually.
Look,
really,
wait a minute.</v>

982
01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:58.460
This chick has a patriotic count for what talent are we?

983
01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:00.630
<v 9>It was just her giving herself.</v>

984
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.000
That's what I'm going to hold it for about five minutes to do this video.

985
01:05:08.501 --> 01:05:13.501
Just to document my experience because I'm expecting,

986
01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:14.440
you know,

987
01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:19.440
maybe to be enlightened or have a spiritual and I wanted to have it on camera.

988
01:05:20.130 --> 01:05:24.830
<v 0>Well cool.
I feel like we did here with a coffee enema.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.</v>

989
01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:29.010
And she was like,
I'm holding it in.
It's a little painful right now.

990
01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:33.660
I'm loving this.
I don't want our kid fucking pulling on a snake,

991
01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:38.370
pulling his snake.
Okay,
let's go back to the p lady.
This is hilarious.

992
01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:41.190
She's going to get enlightened by putting piss in her ass.

993
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.000
<v 9>I'm going to lay on my left side and I'm going to hold it for about five minutes</v>

994
01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.490
just to document my experience.

995
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:58.750
So right now I'm just taking some coconut oil and I'm feeling to liberal Kate.

996
01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:05.430
She is so awesome.
I'm also going to lubricate my bottom end.

997
01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:08.820
<v 0>Oh,
that's right.
She said about him and on the coffee when she's,</v>

998
01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:11.800
it's weird how she's picky about certain words,

999
01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:15.470
but she's putting piss up her butt and her asshole.

1000
01:06:16.030 --> 01:06:18.390
<v 9>Okay,
so I'm waiting on that left side.</v>

1001
01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:23.400
I love this shit to insert the nozzle right now.
You know?

1002
01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:26.830
It makes me,
it makes me,
why is she a couple deep breaths?

1003
01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:29.710
She's really into torturing herself.
This broad

1004
01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:34.410
stop it.

1005
01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:38.730
I'm going to allow the urine to enter my colon doing this.

1006
01:06:39.810 --> 01:06:42.320
I'm going to try to hold it for about five minutes.
Okay.

1007
01:06:42.321 --> 01:06:46.890
I'm opening the clamp now.
Why are you doing this to yourself?

1008
01:06:50.890 --> 01:06:55.300
Oh,
noticing.
Okay.

1009
01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:58.500
<v 0>What is she noticing?
How horrible this feels.</v>

1010
01:06:58.501 --> 01:07:02.810
Remember I was going to try to get someone to piss on my balls.
I don't remember.

1011
01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:07.860
You know what,
how long?
Four minutes is.
Remember when Lgi again,

1012
01:07:07.861 --> 01:07:10.620
but remember when Lj and I were riding the train in the mall?

1013
01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:15.600
That was four minutes.
That's an eternity piss in your asshole dude.

1014
01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.040
And you know how much it hurts to have.

1015
01:07:17.070 --> 01:07:20.250
Have you ever had like anything pushed up your belt like an enema or anything?

1016
01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:24.150
One time I put a suppository in my butt.

1017
01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:28.320
<v 9>Just that suppository.
It's not fun,
Dude.
It fucking hurts.</v>

1018
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:31.980
This chick is crazy.
Opening the clamp again.

1019
01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:38.100
Can't puppy up.
They're
just wrong with this person.

1020
01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:42.180
I'm having a little bit of leakage and I don't,
I don't know why.

1021
01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:47.110
It's leaking out a little bit though.

1022
01:07:47.550 --> 01:07:51.560
Stop doing this.
Stop it.
This chick likes to hurt her.

1023
01:07:51.570 --> 01:07:56.490
So when I open the clamp,
pull one more time.
Please.
Don't you know what?

1024
01:07:56.491 --> 01:07:57.324
I was

1025
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000
starting to have this purple vision.

1026
01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:10.420
Um,
it was drugs.
No,

1027
01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:14.430
<v 0>go to her patron account.
Please donate and,
and,
and then,
right?</v>

1028
01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:19.010
Keep putting up your ass.
Keep picking up your own asshole.

1029
01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:22.390
Rain,
Florence.
Now here's the thing though.
Gene,

1030
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:27.870
<v 9>10,000 more people
coming together.</v>

1031
01:08:28.410 --> 01:08:29.243
Oh Man.

1032
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:32.650
<v 0>You know what though?
When you put something up your bum,</v>

1033
01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:36.700
it absorbs immediately into your bloodstream.
You know that,
right?
Yeah.

1034
01:08:37.450 --> 01:08:42.370
So I don't even know if it's okay to put urine in your bung hole because then

1035
01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:46.180
there's toxins in urine that are going right into her bloodstream.

1036
01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:47.770
There's a reason it's it's waste.

1037
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:52.480
I just picked up on something that I was not expecting and that is what she said

1038
01:08:52.481 --> 01:08:57.370
right now.
We might look,
be looking at the solution this country needs.

1039
01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:01.540
This might be the Martin Luther King Jr of this era,

1040
01:09:01.541 --> 01:09:06.280
and don't attack me for saying so what I want to point out is that when she

1041
01:09:06.281 --> 01:09:07.600
pissed in her own ass,

1042
01:09:08.050 --> 01:09:12.210
she had a vision of all of us coming together and maybe

1043
01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:17.190
<v 9>10,000 more people
coming together.</v>

1044
01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:18.450
Oh,

1045
01:09:18.450 --> 01:09:23.450
is this in response to Charlottesville and support and support me.

1046
01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:26.570
Oh,
have you?
Oh,

1047
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:32.090
<v 0>I mean,
maybe this is the answer to this.</v>

1048
01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:37.970
This divide in our country right now is a,
what if we all did urine enemas?

1049
01:09:40.290 --> 01:09:45.230
A thought provoking suggestion.
And what if somebody like Donald Trump said it?

1050
01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:49.790
What if our pricing is like and want you to take an enema and want you to put it

1051
01:09:49.791 --> 01:09:54.620
in your ass?
I want you to Piss Him pee in your butt and in your own bud by rain.

1052
01:09:54.621 --> 01:09:58.880
Florence rain tried.
It goes tremendous feelings.

1053
01:09:58.881 --> 01:10:03.290
She felt so good.
Democrats and Republicans and independents alike.

1054
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:06.570
<v 9>I'm opening the clamp again.
Wow.</v>

1055
01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:10.920
Oh Wow.
Oh my goodness.

1056
01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:14.640
Let her know.
I almost just want to cry.

1057
01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:18.770
<v 0>Wow.
Geez.
Wow.
Maybe we should give this a try.
Think so.</v>

1058
01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:23.820
<v 9>I'm having a little bit of a sensation and my botox reason region.</v>

1059
01:10:26.170 --> 01:10:29.110
Yeah.
Those are toxins.
Might just be because they,

1060
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:31.780
the urine is a little bit cold.

1061
01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.630
<v 0>Yeah.
There might be other reasons.</v>

1062
01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:40.450
Are there any health benefits to putting urine in your,
in your bom?

1063
01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:45.730
Um,
I dunno,
it was a followup on this or something like that.

1064
01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:51.080
It's enlightenment.
What a psycho.
Yeah.

1065
01:10:52.330 --> 01:10:57.190
Kinds of crazy.
Can't be medically sound.
No,
I mean it's waste.

1066
01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.220
You're essentially putting,
it's like putting poop.

1067
01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:06.940
It would be like taking a shit and then making the shit liquid and then putting

1068
01:11:07.331 --> 01:11:12.250
the shit up your own.
But that's kind of,
I mean,
urine is waste.
It is waste.

1069
01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:14.520
It's not toxic

1070
01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:17.620
<v 2>and,
and horrific for you as a shit.
No,</v>

1071
01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:19.830
you can drink your own urine if you let it sit.

1072
01:11:19.831 --> 01:11:23.190
It will separate and then you can drink the clearer part of it.

1073
01:11:23.191 --> 01:11:27.390
I read that in a book.
Oh No,
you should drink all of it.
That's what I do.

1074
01:11:27.490 --> 01:11:30.300
It's delicious.
Um,

1075
01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:34.890
we also had an email from Dan.
You want to hear what he has to say?
Of course.

1076
01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:36.780
Mommy's.
I just wanted to let you know him.

1077
01:11:36.781 --> 01:11:41.781
I had my third dump of the day already and it's only 12:30 PM normally I poop

1078
01:11:42.461 --> 01:11:43.710
once or twice a day.
I'm wondering,

1079
01:11:43.711 --> 01:11:46.820
do you think this could be a side effect of over hydration?

1080
01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:50.670
I was wondering if this ever happens to Tom in particular.
Keeps me,

1081
01:11:50.671 --> 01:11:54.270
is the water champ top dogs is vice might be needed as well.

1082
01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:59.160
Dan from San Jose.
Oh,
look at Christina.

1083
01:11:59.161 --> 01:12:04.161
Trying to show off in the home stretch when it doesn't count.

1084
01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:08.580
I think it's indicative of,
yes,
your water intake.

1085
01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:12.270
It could be something like that.
Fiber or an irritation.

1086
01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:16.230
Now you didn't tell us what number you're taking.
Is it Loosey Goosey?

1087
01:12:16.530 --> 01:12:21.180
Are we talking,
you know,
is it,
is it a little bit of a slider?
What is it?
Yeah,

1088
01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:24.270
we don't know detail.
You're Brown,

1089
01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:29.370
but I would feel three by 1230 is a lot.
That's pretty aggressive.

1090
01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:30.630
It sounds sick.

1091
01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:33.390
I mean who knows if he sent another email after that and it was like,
oh,

1092
01:12:33.391 --> 01:12:37.620
it's 6:00 PM I've taken six shifts.
You have diarrhea and that's what I'm saying.

1093
01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:42.960
This guy could be just sick.
Um,
so Christina shot a special,
uh,

1094
01:12:42.961 --> 01:12:46.110
in June.
Some of you were there and um,
you know,

1095
01:12:46.111 --> 01:12:49.350
she'll have an announcement about it soon in the lead up to it.

1096
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:54.120
She's been doing a lot of press.
It's getting things ready for it to come out.

1097
01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:59.440
I don't want to hear this here is Christina talking about her news?

1098
01:13:00.311 --> 01:13:02.570
Special works cited this show everybody.

1099
01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:08.330
<v 3>It's up lizard.
Yeah,
we'll be fine.</v>

1100
01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.860
You've got an ear.
Be Pack.

1101
01:13:15.630 --> 01:13:18.520
The dude with the cameras.
Scared.
Do Mac.

1102
01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:28.440
<v 2>We're excited about
my hair is a little darker.
Yeah.</v>

1103
01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:30.720
And it's a different outfit than I normally see you in.

1104
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.850
<v 3>Nick,
do you comprehend?
I moved from California,</v>

1105
01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:39.840
California.
You don't know.

1106
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:44.190
I'm in California in 2012 my parents gave me

1107
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.823
and

1108
01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:52.050
<v 2>my dog.
I bought him a dog.
Why do you think,</v>

1109
01:13:52.051 --> 01:13:56.090
what do you think's going on with her?
Sorry,
what did,

1110
01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:57.180
what were you thinking there?

1111
01:13:57.540 --> 01:14:00.090
Why are you telling this guy about your dog and your well,
I mean,
look,

1112
01:14:00.091 --> 01:14:01.800
I was excited about the special.

1113
01:14:01.801 --> 01:14:06.801
I had a little too many to celebrate and just tried to give him,

1114
01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:08.610
get an interview and didn't come out right.

1115
01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:13.390
<v 3>Not like some pit bull dog run around</v>

1116
01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:17.500
and that little girl,
we'll be in the hospital tonight,

1117
01:14:17.501 --> 01:14:21.070
but it looks like she's going to be okay.
As far as any charges or anything.

1118
01:14:21.071 --> 01:14:22.420
Nothing's pending at this point.

1119
01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:25.930
There's still needs to be further investigation and this is actually the

1120
01:14:25.931 --> 01:14:27.740
homeowner.
We're going to,
we're going to talk,

1121
01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:30.260
we're going to toss it back to you in the studio.
Randy,
don't want to add.

1122
01:14:32.570 --> 01:14:36.340
<v 0>He's a pro.
Yeah.
Yell it together.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1123
01:14:37.050 --> 01:14:37.881
That's like a heckler.

1124
01:14:37.881 --> 01:14:41.490
It's like when you're doing your show and some drug assholes trying to up.

1125
01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.060
<v 3>You're fine.</v>

1126
01:14:43.150 --> 01:14:48.150
Any reports on any dogs being loose from my house or um,

1127
01:14:50.710 --> 01:14:55.330
loose and running around or have,
there is one.

1128
01:14:56.230 --> 01:15:01.000
There was a dog fight.
I got rid of it.
One dog.

1129
01:15:01.570 --> 01:15:04.950
<v 0>This lady needs the whistle.
The whistle.</v>

1130
01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:10.110
Blow the whistle.
She does need the whistle dog whistle.
That should win.

1131
01:15:10.111 --> 01:15:14.160
Lose or dog.
Yeah.
Uh,
you use the code word mom.

1132
01:15:14.570 --> 01:15:17.430
She should get that.
Can we,
can we find her,
you think and tell her about it?

1133
01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:20.813
<v 6>Here's,</v>

1134
01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:26.670
<v 0>ah,
man,
this is you.
This is you.</v>

1135
01:15:26.730 --> 01:15:31.230
I moved from California.
Oh,
there you are.
How's that not you?

1136
01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:33.330
I didn't say it wasn't.
Yeah,

1137
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:37.860
I told that I had a little too much,
too much to drink.

1138
01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:41.520
That happens.
That shouldn't,
I shouldn't have talked to that guy.

1139
01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:43.770
I know that that happens.

1140
01:15:46.730 --> 01:15:50.030
<v 6>Um,
let's see.
Dude.</v>

1141
01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:55.360
<v 0>Blow the whistle to
blow the whistle.
Let's see.</v>

1142
01:15:55.361 --> 01:15:58.150
I know where our dogs out are right now because of the whistle.

1143
01:15:58.790 --> 01:16:00.800
<v 6>Yeah,
Paulo is all.</v>

1144
01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:03.890
<v 0>Did you do</v>

1145
01:16:06.450 --> 01:16:07.283
<v 6>okay?</v>

1146
01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:09.093
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1147
01:16:13.950 --> 01:16:15.870
Why did you do that?
No,
I don't trust you

1148
01:16:19.810 --> 01:16:24.670
now.
We're done.
It was so funny.
We're done.
It's fun.

1149
01:16:24.671 --> 01:16:28.750
It's,
I don't trust him.
I put on the headphones.
Run to do

1150
01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:36.370
med bones back on.
Come on.
No,
I'll take it down.
No you won't.
Yeah,

1151
01:16:36.371 --> 01:16:39.510
I'll take it down.
Take what down.
Clip it down.

1152
01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:44.820
<v 6>Here we go.
Here it is.
There it is.
Over.</v>

1153
01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:50.070
Done.
Done.
Done.
I don't trust you.
I promise it's over.

1154
01:16:50.730 --> 01:16:54.960
I promise.
Nope.
Yeah,
it's done.

1155
01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:59.740
<v 0>Yo.
Fuck.
And not listening.
I took it off.</v>

1156
01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:03.280
I took,
I put the agent guy on from the train earlier.

1157
01:17:04.210 --> 01:17:05.330
<v 6>He's,
he's back up.</v>

1158
01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:10.140
<v 0>We went to a restaurant and I had them bring</v>

1159
01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:14.090
<v 2>you a slice of birthday cake and you got really,</v>

1160
01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:17.780
you did it when I was in the bathroom.
You know,

1161
01:17:17.781 --> 01:17:21.650
I tried to avoid as much sugar as I can.
Yeah.
Which this cake is special.

1162
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.970
This place where we go,

1163
01:17:22.971 --> 01:17:25.730
they have a fantastic cake and you don't want to miss out on it.

1164
01:17:25.731 --> 01:17:28.760
You don't have to add the whole thing.
It's hard to resist.
But anyways,

1165
01:17:28.761 --> 01:17:32.960
it did say happy birthday and I had a candle in it.
I was like,
you got so mad.

1166
01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:37.790
Yeah.
Why do you hate that so much?
I Dunno.
I don't like it.
I don't like it.

1167
01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:41.810
You don't like people singing you happy birthday or I don't like the attention

1168
01:17:41.811 --> 01:17:43.670
that it draws.
Isn't that an interesting,

1169
01:17:43.671 --> 01:17:46.010
but yet all you do is get attention for a living,

1170
01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:51.110
but I like it in that
moment.

1171
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:55.280
I like it when I'm on stage.
You could control the attention.

1172
01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:57.740
I don't like attention offstage.
Right.

1173
01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:02.540
I don't need to get a bunch of attention when I walk into a room,
know.
All right.

1174
01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:06.200
How about bank?
Do you like it when they sing happy birthday?
No,
I do not.

1175
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:10.940
I don't like surprise parties.
I don't like being sung to,

1176
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:15.560
I don't like a big,
I don't like a big reception.
Like if I walk into a place,

1177
01:18:15.561 --> 01:18:18.740
I don't like everybody to say something too.
I don't like that.

1178
01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:22.400
You don't want to be like norm from cheers.
No,
I like to fly under the radar.

1179
01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:25.610
Yeah,
that's true.
You're kind of low key guy.
Yeah.
Interesting.

1180
01:18:25.670 --> 01:18:29.000
I like people to pay attention when I'm up there and that's it.
Yeah.
I agree.

1181
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:33.860
Similar.
Yeah.
I don't mind the happy birthday.
It's embarrassing.

1182
01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:35.960
Yeah.
But you're,
you know,

1183
01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:40.190
but I've got a great personality and a more festive and more fun.
You're fun.

1184
01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:45.020
You just conceded that I'm more fun and more festive and therefore a personality

1185
01:18:45.021 --> 01:18:48.950
champ.
Thank you.
We're good.
There's a good case for that.
Um,
oh my God.

1186
01:18:48.951 --> 01:18:51.600
Just admitted to the case.
You are.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
You are.

1187
01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:54.620
If I put these on and I hear Barf,
you're not,
we're going to wrap up.

1188
01:18:54.650 --> 01:18:59.290
We got to wrap up.
We've got to wrap up.
Um,
I don't trust you.

1189
01:18:59.330 --> 01:19:00.440
Thank you guys for listening.

1190
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:03.770
We're going to have some guests coming up in the next few weeks.

1191
01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:08.090
It should be a lot of fun.
And,
um,
I dunno.
I think that's it gene.

1192
01:19:08.490 --> 01:19:11.390
That's it.
And we've got a snake in our yard.
We got to go take care of the state.

1193
01:19:11.470 --> 01:19:16.180
We've got to get these fucking headphones fixed.
Like don't be so mad,
but we'll,

1194
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:17.300
we'll get it taken care of.

1195
01:19:17.301 --> 01:19:22.301
Here is the four oh nine remix lady luck by Chris.

1196
01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:28.940
Is it just Chris or does her last name here?
Chris Spence.

1197
01:19:28.941 --> 01:19:33.380

1200
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:16.310
<v 11>Do you want me to touch?
We're on the brink of civil war in this country</v>

1201
01:20:18.610 --> 01:20:19.443
Mafia.

1202
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:42.703
Yeah,

1203
01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:04.350
yeah.
