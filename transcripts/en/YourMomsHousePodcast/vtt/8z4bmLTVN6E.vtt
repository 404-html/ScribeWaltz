Tom and his wife is Dina made a Hashtag.

7
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.890
Why is so fat saying that I'm fat it not accurate.

8
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.123
I got the joke.

9
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.760
You just haven't gotten wet and it's been like three weeks all I get her.

10
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.900
Bobby's on social.

11
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.900
That's a nice shirt.
Was so tight like it might

12
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.390
die if
this fire,

13
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.910
this guy does change.
Okay.

14
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.620
You're going to try to find a way to say that time we know better.

15
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.730
You Bet.

16
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.750
The thing is that nobody,
nobody.

17
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.220
<v 0>Oh Man.
It's one of my favorite heroes.
So beautiful.</v>

18
00:02:21.221 --> 00:02:25.510
The Sun that is a MC tight jeans back in the day.

19
00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:26.500
That was during the,

20
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.100
when we really kicked off the who is fat Verdis fat while you sleep that night

21
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.190
of our era.
The bird is fat.

22
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.140
The time is fan here and was so excited to have him back today.

23
00:02:35.141 --> 00:02:36.250
It's going to be so much fun,

24
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.530
but we watched a special on Netflix secret time.
Guess what?

25
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.940
He's still fat.
Yeah.
Oh,
uh,
and for those of you wondering,
like,
how did you vote?

26
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.430
He doesn't know.
I've seen it yet either because I got a screener.

27
00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:55.420
How did I get a screener?
I'm a Hollywood movie star.
I'm a television star.

28
00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.280
I'm a podcast.
I'm an international comedian,
right?
A director

29
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.210
<v 3>I say are dancers before the reg is the public state it.
And people were like,</v>

30
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.350
let me give it to you.
So that's how I saw it.
You know,

31
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.480
it's interesting that show,
um,
uh,
insatiable on Netflix right now,

32
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.980
getting a lot of heat for being fat shaming.
Oh,
great.
And then,

33
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.630
and there are like,
uh,
people,
um,
wanting it to be taken down.

34
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.440
It's so silly.
I mean,
I,
I've started watching it.
I'm four episodes and I love it.

35
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.300
Art and Mirin Janette and she's fantastic,
but you know,
uh,

36
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.330
but,
but it's not all bad.
We fat shame Bart.

37
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:35.470
And for a while we got him to slim down and I got fat.
Shame too.

38
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.311
Don't forget that part.

39
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:40.900
And it was very useful when she say it worked to your benefit.
100%.
Yeah.

40
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.680
And by the way,
it hasn't really slowed down as much as you think it would.

41
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.430
People comment to me pretty consistently.
Yeah.

42
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.700
Well how do you feel about fat shaming?
I mean,
here's,
here's the truth.

43
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.150
I kind of feel like it's not good for you to be fat.
So people are like,

44
00:03:58.151 --> 00:04:01.780
hey,
we should encourage people to stay fat.
Is that the thinking here?

45
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.760
I'm totally on board with fat shaming.
I a full endorser,
first of all,

46
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:09.770
I've experienced it,
um,
you know that right now.

47
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.330
And I shamed myself over it.
I knew I shamed myself constantly.

48
00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:17.290
I don't believe in loving myself at my fattest.

49
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:22.420
I don't believe in accepting myself and I don't want to accept you at your

50
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.210
fantasy,
you know?
So,
um,
yeah,
I mean,
I,

51
00:04:26.211 --> 00:04:28.600
I know there's people who are like,
it's horrible debt.

52
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.300
I think it's world bull to be as fat as you are.
I think so too.

53
00:04:31.301 --> 00:04:36.150
It's unhealthy stopping.
So fat stop being so fat,
it doesn't roast leg

54
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.150
and um,
yeah,
you're going to die sooner.
And here's the thing,

55
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.230
overeating is an addiction of sorts.
Correct.
Would you agree?

56
00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:52.000
Unless it is truly glandular or truly a medical percentage of people are like my

57
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:55.870
thyroid accent.
So there's,
there's a handful of people who it's a medical thing.

58
00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:59.710
Sure,
sure.
Yeah.
But then for the rest of us who have weight,

59
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.990
you're just overeating.
It's an addiction.
Um,
so why,
you know what I'm saying?

60
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.560
You know,
you're not supposed to be that fat.
You're not as fast.

61
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.430
But I'm saying that.

62
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.870
So why don't we get into addiction shaming yet there are TV shows.
Where are we?

63
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.100
We glorify shaming intervention for instance.
Isn't that then,
shouldn't we say,

64
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.310
oh we can't drug addict shame isn't that it is a shame.

65
00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:23.600
And they tried to embarrass them basically.
That's right.

66
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.760
So there are entire and hoarders,
that's a show based on it.
That's an addiction.

67
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.500
And if they're super happy and you're very fat,

68
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.000
you're in denial.
Yeah.
You're not happy.
You're not,
you know,
that's not,

69
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:41.770
shouldn't be that fat.
No,
it's true.

70
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.180
It is true.
True.

71
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.460
Nor should you a drink a lot more than you do drugs or try anything in excess.

72
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.480
Excess isn't good.
All the addiction is bad.
Dude,
I'm trying to take,

73
00:05:52.481 --> 00:05:55.520
I mean like I'm fat now.
I'm not fat.
Well I'm,

74
00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:58.970
I'm saying I'm actively still trying to lose weight.

75
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.080
I'm losing baby working out,
eating better,

76
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:06.800
eating right at my absolute fattest.

77
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.780
If you had asked me like,
um,
are you okay with your weight?

78
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.670
Maybe,
I don't know if publicly I would have been like,
yeah,
fine if I,

79
00:06:15.671 --> 00:06:17.750
if I would have had it that lie going to myself,

80
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.880
I know that privately I definitely wouldn't have.
And you know,

81
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.180
it's tough to accept the fat shaming at first,
but then you're like,

82
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:30.110
you know what?
I need to hear this.
I'm serious.
It's true.
And we,
you know,

83
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:33.620
we talk about Latin culture,
how they're very over,

84
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:36.320
like they call you Flocka if you're skinny or Gordo,

85
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.680
if you're a fatty and Hungarian culture at same thing,

86
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.900
they will tell you to your face that you're fat.

87
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.780
When I would used to go to Peru like much more often,

88
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.270
like you literally walk off the plane and you're talking,

89
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:51.260
you're seeing a relative you haven't seen in maybe two or three years and you'd

90
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:53.540
give them a hug.
And it's this big celebratory,
you know,

91
00:06:53.541 --> 00:06:57.110
it's an affectionate culture.
Sure.
You give him a big hug,
kiss,
oh my God.

92
00:06:57.111 --> 00:06:57.960
And they're like,
it's just,

93
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.540
you can go to him and we would tell you right away he looked pretty fat.
Sure.

94
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.850
Like God dammit dude.
And you're like,
I just got here.

95
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:08.690
Like you're ruining my whole fucking trip there.
Like that right away.

96
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.770
I don't know what the stupid American thing is that we should love ourselves

97
00:07:12.771 --> 00:07:15.830
when we're unhealthy.
We're overweight.
It's not good.

98
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.430
There's nothing good about being overweight.
No,
there's not.

99
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.610
It is an addiction like any other addiction,
like alcohol,
like smoking years.

100
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.380
Why are we,
and we have no problem shaming smokers.
How come there's no campaign?

101
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.610
Oh,
here you shame me.
Your cigarette shaming or your alcohol shaming.

102
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.060
And sometimes there is,
there's that pushback.
If you know someone in person,

103
00:07:35.061 --> 00:07:37.760
they'll be like,
don't give me any shit about smoking.
And sometimes I'm like,

104
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.460
all right,
I'm going to,
I'm not going to give you shit about,
go ahead and smoke.

105
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.930
But as a general rule,
the public is allowed to smoke shame.

106
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:46.110
You're allowed to go.

107
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:50.150
That addiction we at were okay with because it's inherently bad,
but then again,

108
00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:51.140
so is being overweight.

109
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:56.170
That's inherently of course the problem is there's so many people that are

110
00:07:56.781 --> 00:08:01.781
overweight and there's such an overeating bad food like culture that we live in

111
00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:06.410
here that people just go like,
let's not all feel badly all the time.

112
00:08:06.411 --> 00:08:07.400
That we should feel bad though.

113
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.310
But that's how you change is you feel bad and you say,

114
00:08:10.311 --> 00:08:13.580
I don't like how this looks.
I don't like how this feels.
I don't want to live.

115
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.350
All right.
Um,
and this is why we're doing bird a service.

116
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.760
<v 4>I'm saying we're hooking them up.</v>

161
00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.770

164
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.140
There's so much to go over.
Big News too.
We've got big news to share.

165
00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.900
Big News to share all kinds of things to talk about.

166
00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.740
<v 3>Get into it.
Jean Jean,
here we go.</v>

167
00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:33.520
<v 1>Times.
If the cow refuses,
they'll stimulate its sexual organs.</v>

168
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:41.560
This unusual technique,
the Cadillac tax,

169
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.310
it's natural response to a calf attempting to suckle.

170
00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:55.510
Don't bring anyone loving to live.
No bombing the fungus.
Well,
welcome.

171
00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.360
Welcome to your mom's house.

172
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:06.190
<v 3>Tastes like shit.
What are you drinking?
Kava ice shit.</v>

173
00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:13.240
Ah.
You know what I'm saying?
That was horrifying.

174
00:12:13.241 --> 00:12:17.380
Yeah.
That's what they do in some cultures,
I guess.
Yeah,
I know.
Yeah.
Well,
no,

175
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.720
he was he licking,
he was stimulating what?

176
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.290
I think he was looking at her badge or blowing air to it or something to

177
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:25.390
stimulate the lactation.
Yeah,
but a calf,

178
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:29.740
a calf doesn't lick the mother's vagina.
Tick get milk.
I mean,

179
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:34.340
this seems like it says simulates the sexual organ and that's what does it,
so,

180
00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:38.140
oh wow.
Yeah.
It's interesting.
Oh,
check it out again.
Please don't

181
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.600
<v 1>times.
If the cow refuses,
they'll stimulate its sexual organ.
It is</v>

182
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:51.360
this unusual technique encourages the Cadillac tax.

183
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:56.830
It's natural response to a calf attempting to satellite.
Okay.
Hold on.

184
00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:02.240
Hold on.
Young boys are often responsible for carrying out this task.
Nice.

185
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:06.970
<v 3>Yeah.
What else?</v>

186
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:12.880
<v 1>Another Dinka custom is showering under urinating couch.
Oh,</v>

187
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:13.953
that's nice.

188
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:18.060
<v 3>Well,
he's doing,
he's got a euro turns.
Their hair are popular.</v>

189
00:13:18.061 --> 00:13:20.340
Look for both children and adults.

190
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.870
Probably kids always getting this stuff done to that.
A lot of piss too.

191
00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.860
I mean that was such an enormous,

192
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.740
like it's such a huge amount of as a shower.
Yeah.
I mean that didn't goes,

193
00:13:31.741 --> 00:13:35.010
Huh?
That's a real pissed.
That's a golden shower.
Yeah.

194
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.840
I hate when you go like piss on me and someone just has like a little stream.

195
00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:41.750
Sure.
A piss,
you know.
I mean,
look that I try it.
And African cow customer.

196
00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:46.410
You're showering under urinating counter.
Sure.
I mean that's like somebody,

197
00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:52.910
a hose.
Matt is a night at Nice custom.

198
00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:58.180
What would you rather do?
Two jobs to choose from?
Okay.
Okay.

199
00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.440
You're a member of the Dinka tribe.
You're,
you're over there.

200
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:06.990
Do you a take the cow ps pissed shower all day.

201
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:11.640
It's nine to five.
It's what you're doing.
Account p's on your head.
Sure.

202
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:16.670
Or once an hour you stimulate the cows vagina with your mouth.

203
00:14:16.831 --> 00:14:19.830
The way I would stimulate the vagina with your mouth.
Yeah,

204
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:24.980
I think I'm not into as much the getting urinated on by the cow and like buckets

205
00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:29.160
of it.
Okay.
What if I change the parameter then again,

206
00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:33.150
I get that cool hair color change,
right?
That's the whole point.
Yeah.
I mean,

207
00:14:33.151 --> 00:14:36.480
you could use nitrogen peroxide,
Odell Beckham Jr.
Look,

208
00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.130
I don't even know who that is.
I know,
but you,

209
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:43.950
you could use peroxide hydrogen,
but that,
that's too easy.

210
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.390
You got to get the cow urinating.

211
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:50.400
What if it's just once an hour or a cow passes on you or you stimulate the

212
00:14:50.401 --> 00:14:51.770
Oregon organs?

213
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.133
<v 5>MMM,</v>

214
00:14:55.770 --> 00:15:00.420
<v 3>just once an hour or the,
the cab pisses on me.
How often?
No.</v>

215
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:01.920
Once an hour it's like Dang,

216
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.360
timer goes off and you either get pissed on by the cow or Yg,

217
00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:07.810
stimulate their mouth,

218
00:15:07.811 --> 00:15:11.860
stimulating with your mouth on a cow's Vasheen what he was doing.
Dude,

219
00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:15.190
you're crazy.
I would choose getting pissed on any day.
Why?

220
00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:18.820
Because I don't put my mouth on a cow's filthy vagina.
First of all,

221
00:15:18.821 --> 00:15:22.950
how do you know I'm not turned on by that?
No,

222
00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:27.310
that would be a first.
Yeah,
you're into that.
Yeah,
baby.

223
00:15:27.311 --> 00:15:32.060
It's an animal's badge.
It's not that big of a deal.
Okay.

224
00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:37.270
I think I would do it and had no problem with it.
I'd rather get peed on.
Really?

225
00:15:37.271 --> 00:15:41.810
Yeah.
I mean,
you realize that you're covered in lights for me.
I'm like,
Eh,
I,

226
00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:45.870
and then I'm back to doing what I do.
If you're just drenched in Calabasas,

227
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:50.050
my head,
if you see how it does dripping off his face,
it was okay,

228
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.630
but then I can put my head under water and then I can,

229
00:15:52.631 --> 00:15:57.180
what do you think you smell like after that?
It's not lavender bodywash.
Yeah,

230
00:15:57.181 --> 00:16:00.130
but in the Dinka tribe,
maybe they like the way that smells.
Oh,

231
00:16:00.131 --> 00:16:03.640
now you're moving to the whole tribe.
You're,
you're,
you're a member of the tribe,

232
00:16:03.641 --> 00:16:06.850
dude.
That's number one.
You're moving to wherever these people live.

233
00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.790
You're sleeping in their huts or wherever they live.

234
00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:14.920
You're doing the dances and you're,
you're licking the,
the,
the cow badge.
Yeah.

235
00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:19.780
<v 0>Okay.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.</v>

236
00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.690
Okay.
I think it's fine.
I think I'm fine.

237
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:27.480
I'll tell you what I'm just distracted by right now.
Hmm.
How beautiful I am.
Yes.

238
00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.860
Number am yes.
Number two,

239
00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:36.220
my Starbucks service is going down downhill.
Oh my God.
My local,

240
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:40.090
my a one Starbucks.
I've noticed some turnover.

241
00:16:40.091 --> 00:16:42.220
I notice some of

242
00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:46.030
<v 3>higher performers are gone now.</v>

243
00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:49.270
This is the thing is that I've noticed that you've been,
you've,

244
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.840
you're a connoisseur of the Starbucks in our neighborhood.
You,

245
00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:56.050
you tried them all and this is your favorite place.
That's location.

246
00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:59.740
And this is because they know your order.
When you come in they say hello to you.

247
00:16:59.741 --> 00:17:04.450
They have great customer service.
They're on top of it.
They're just,
yeah,

248
00:17:04.451 --> 00:17:05.020
it's just,

249
00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.870
I mean you go out of your way to go there because the other ones or drive

250
00:17:07.871 --> 00:17:10.990
through this one.
We have to park that one.
Nah,

251
00:17:10.991 --> 00:17:14.220
I mean the drive through one is chaos.
It's that is,

252
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:17.920
is that an exit for the 101 terrible.
Yeah,
it's chaos.

253
00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:21.310
It's at a gas station too and there's a line of cars,

254
00:17:21.311 --> 00:17:24.040
the clutter up the gas station and the boulevard.

255
00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:26.740
It's a really bad place for a Starbucks now.

256
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:30.370
But I'm saying that you go the extra mile and you park your car.
Yeah.

257
00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:35.400
And often you make LJ and I wait in the truck while you go in and you get your

258
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:39.890
comp,
your,
your diarrhea in a cup.
And then,
uh,

259
00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.240
but you're telling me today your experience was different.
So what happened?
Well,

260
00:17:43.241 --> 00:17:48.241
I've noticed it like there was a couple like really great employees there.

261
00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.130
Yeah,
I mean these,
these

262
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.750
<v 0>people,
seriously,
I'll walk in and go,
hi Tom.
Hi.
No like extra ice.</v>

263
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:59.540
It's ready to go.
I'm like,
what the fuck man.
Like that.
They know you,

264
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:02.010
they anticipate your needs and I see them do it to other people.

265
00:18:02.011 --> 00:18:04.400
It's not just me movie star,
TV star,

266
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.960
it's other regular common petty people.

267
00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:13.890
Peasants also got good attention from.
Sure.
So I would be like,
wow.

268
00:18:13.891 --> 00:18:18.000
Even like a regular,
you know,
bottom dwellers,

269
00:18:18.001 --> 00:18:21.180
getting nice attention from them.
It not just,
Oh you know,

270
00:18:21.181 --> 00:18:25.680
this celebrity guy comes in.
So I was like,

271
00:18:25.681 --> 00:18:26.910
this is the Starbucks.

272
00:18:26.911 --> 00:18:31.911
And I noticed probably three or four faces that I would see on routine that I'm

273
00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:36.780
like,
these are all stars.
This is the best location that group into.

274
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:41.010
And I don't know if they either moved on in careers.
What I did here,

275
00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:46.220
I overheard a little gossip was somebody asking about one of them and they're

276
00:18:46.381 --> 00:18:46.651
like,
oh,

277
00:18:46.651 --> 00:18:51.180
they moved so and so to this location to like get that thing up and running.

278
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.590
So what they did is they outsource their good employees to teach,

279
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:58.380
teach or Starbucks how to be better.
Right.
And now we have shitty,

280
00:18:58.381 --> 00:19:01.460
you're Starbucks,
you're suffering such bullets.
So dumb.

281
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:05.970
It's like what they did in the late eighties and nineties here in la La Unified

282
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:06.690
School district.

283
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:09.930
They would take the gang bangers from the bad neighborhoods and then bust them

284
00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.730
into the nice ones and were like,
I think that's a nationwide thing babe.

285
00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:20.820
It's like giving people an opportunity to go to better school.
It was a bad idea.

286
00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:25.160
Here's the thing,
if it's not la,
you know I don't care about no,
it was a,

287
00:19:25.161 --> 00:19:26.660
it was a horrible idea.
No,

288
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.110
and then they took the good kids and put them in the gang banger schools.

289
00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:33.990
They put kids in gang bangers.
Why would it happen to Brody Stevens?

290
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:37.530
Why would they do that?
Because it was,
it was an exchange program.
Right.

291
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.450
They take the kids from the rougher neighborhoods,

292
00:19:39.451 --> 00:19:43.530
put them in the nicer ones and vice versa and ended up being a huge disaster.

293
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:48.270
Okay.
So this is what I'm saying to Starbucks is a corporation.
Bad idea.

294
00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:52.270
Bad idea.
And it's a big thumbs down from me.
Yeah.
Very disciplined.

295
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.860
Happened today that you felt that you are not served well,

296
00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:57.900
I mean there's just little things you notice.

297
00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.700
First of all I know is on that APP yesterday.

298
00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:04.940
Then when we stopped at that same place you wanted water and so I try to get you

299
00:20:05.131 --> 00:20:08.760
a water on the APP and it said sold out.
I was like,
oh,
they're sold out of water.

300
00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:12.090
That's crazy.
I went in there and I saw like 200 bottles of water.

301
00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:17.250
So I told the Lady,
I go says sold out in your APP,
but you know,

302
00:20:17.251 --> 00:20:18.720
just so you know,
she's like,
oh,

303
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.080
what happened was we probably were sold at at some point and somebody just

304
00:20:22.081 --> 00:20:25.650
forgot to turn it back on.
I go,
okay.
Then I came today,

305
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:29.340
says sold out again still.
Yeah.
And the same girls there.

306
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.550
I didn't bring it up and I'm like,
oh,
they're just like missing a beat,
you know.

307
00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:37.530
And that was yesterday.
So they had all full 24 hours to rectify the situation.

308
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:41.130
And I know that some of you losers out there listening are like give them a

309
00:20:41.131 --> 00:20:43.950
break,
but that's why you're a fucking loser.
Right.

310
00:20:43.951 --> 00:20:48.040
Because you have low standards.
Sure.
You know,
I have higher standards cause

311
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.940
<v 3>I'm a fucking winner.
Right.
I agree.
Yeah.
You've got a winner's attitude.</v>

312
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.310
I love Starbucks is,
you know,
yeah.

313
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:59.580
I was a Barista in the summer of 1997 at the do whatever your job is to try to

314
00:20:59.741 --> 00:21:02.110
do it well,
Tarzana location.
Sure.
Yeah.

315
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.620
I'm a trained Barista and I believe I love star.

316
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:10.420
Oh I saw you here this morning at the house.
Go Flip,
flip flip and you just yeah.

317
00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.200
Whack in the form of filter.
I steam the milk.

318
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:16.740
<v 6>She's impressive</v>

319
00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.010
<v 3>stuff.
I did the call,
right?
Yeah.</v>

320
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:23.990
That will tall nonfat latte Latte,
double tall.

321
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:27.770
Um,
but anyways,
I'm just,
I'm just like,

322
00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:29.780
you know why I don't like to see you upset.

323
00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:33.740
And you came back in the car and you were very upset about your level of
service.

324
00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:38.030
They were really,
they're just dragon.
They're just dragging in there now.

325
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:41.360
And then there's be,
you know,
there's three people waiting.

326
00:21:41.361 --> 00:21:44.210
It still takes you like 10,
15 minutes.
Like,
I'm getting an iced coffee.

327
00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.260
Come on man.
Your shit together.
Yeah.
Source,
whatever.
Well,

328
00:21:48.261 --> 00:21:49.790
I'll tell you why I'm disappointed and I,

329
00:21:49.791 --> 00:21:54.320
I agree with you a Starbucks because they really do put a lot of priority into

330
00:21:54.321 --> 00:21:56.640
training their people to be good.
I know.

331
00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:00.260
And to be efficient and to be familiar with the products and to know everything.

332
00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.880
So I,
I'm,
I'm,

333
00:22:01.881 --> 00:22:05.540
I'm a little upset for you because I believe in Starbucks as a company and I

334
00:22:05.541 --> 00:22:10.490
know that this is my version of top dog.
It is.

335
00:22:10.491 --> 00:22:14.490
And I,
I didn't want to point that out and be a complete wifey to you.

336
00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.900
This is basically the behavior.
Yeah,
I understand.
Yeah.

337
00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:22.820
<v 6>So you're boycotting the gunnels.
Yeah.
Well,
I love their coffee.</v>

338
00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:24.680
It's in fact it's the best coffee.
Right.

339
00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.730
But they gone to drive through lanes.
Yeah.

340
00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.500
And so what happened is,
I mean time did

341
00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:35.330
the lanes the other day.

342
00:22:35.331 --> 00:22:40.310
It took me 13 minutes to get my coffee to the Dreiser.
Yeah.

343
00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:46.910
And yeah,
and because even though they have two lanes,
yeah,

344
00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.910
they don't process it as fast as they should.
So the,
sure,

345
00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:54.950
so from a customer point of view,
Margaret and I talked to them about that.

346
00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:55.410
What do you

347
00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:59.490
<v 3>do,
Sam?
Becoming my dad.
He talks them,
here's the second step though.
Jeans.
Yeah.</v>

348
00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:02.670
You're not,
you're voicing your opinion on this show.
Right.

349
00:23:02.671 --> 00:23:06.210
You need to be talking to corporate headquarters right now because that's,

350
00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:10.830
that's a few years from now.
I can't,
I can't go full dad yet.

351
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:15.330
That's another level.
Right now it's like I just keep it internal.

352
00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.290
I'm not trying to get someone in trouble.
You know what I mean?

353
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:20.970
Trying to get someone fired.
I'm not trying to be like,

354
00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:25.790
I'm just venting to you and hundreds of thousands of other people.
Sure.

355
00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:30.180
Who listen.
But yeah,
I'm not going to go pull the manager aside.

356
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.540
Well that's a full fucking dad moved.

357
00:23:32.541 --> 00:23:34.830
That's when you're really angry at the world.
It's like,

358
00:23:34.831 --> 00:23:39.810
this is like a level five irritation,
venting irritation.

359
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:44.370
That's somewhere to put your complaints in the world somewhere to be angry.
Yeah.

360
00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.890
But then we have a customer service [inaudible] I don't know.
Let me think.

361
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:51.530
I was Starbucks.
I am disappointing because as a former employee of theirs,

362
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.930
I believe that they should have high standards.

363
00:23:53.931 --> 00:23:57.480
They're a great company and they do work really hard.
Yeah.
Um,

364
00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:01.130
I'm sure there's tons of stuff.
I feel the same.
I get irritated if,

365
00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.520
I mean they get the blacks out of there quickly,
like they do things,
you know,

366
00:24:04.521 --> 00:24:08.780
that they closed down for sensitivity training a while back.
I went that day.

367
00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:13.490
Yeah,
I was,
I walked in,
I tried to walk into those stupid,
I'm like,
hello.

368
00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.870
I met like we are raised this where the training right now.
I was like,

369
00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:22.340
oh sorry.
Uh,
they wouldn't let me in because I went there just at the,

370
00:24:22.341 --> 00:24:25.100
as they were closing,
they were like,
no whites allowed

371
00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:31.710
you to experience it now,
Bro.
Um,
I get,

372
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.260
I get annoyed too with long lines at coffee places because efficiency is key.

373
00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.380
Definitely.
And if you're waiting and waiting and you're like,
dude,

374
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:42.860
if I can kill me,
kill me.
I don't like that.

375
00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:47.840
I get more annoyed with airports,
slowness and airline inefficiency.

376
00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:52.010
I get annoyed where it's like a late night or a late flight.

377
00:24:52.011 --> 00:24:54.830
You're on the last flight of the day and you're waiting and you're waiting and

378
00:24:54.831 --> 00:24:56.720
you're waiting.
And then they go,
oh,

379
00:24:56.721 --> 00:25:01.721
the flight's canceled because the crew they timed out or something stupid and

380
00:25:01.911 --> 00:25:04.200
you're like,
wait a minute.
What does this have to do with me?

381
00:25:04.201 --> 00:25:05.840
Like that's your poor planning.

382
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:09.440
FAA rules can only work 10 hours in a row.

383
00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:14.120
And you guys hadn't thought of this sooner because they're supposed to be here,

384
00:25:14.121 --> 00:25:15.310
but then they're not here.
Right?

385
00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:20.690
I've been there many times and you're displacing so many people by doing that.

386
00:25:20.691 --> 00:25:21.471
Like,
oh great,

387
00:25:21.471 --> 00:25:25.250
now I'm spending the night in fucking Detroit because you guys can't fax.

388
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:26.090
You're steps ahead.

389
00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:30.590
I have spent the night in Detroit for that and one of the best things about that

390
00:25:30.591 --> 00:25:33.680
one horrible.
We got.
So we got delayed at the,

391
00:25:33.681 --> 00:25:36.470
you're at the gate and they're like,
well,
you're not going to take off.

392
00:25:36.471 --> 00:25:40.730
Everybody's like,
Oh fuck no.
And people get,
you know,
and they're like crazy.

393
00:25:40.731 --> 00:25:45.050
Just get on the shuttle and go to a hotel.
And they were like,
um,

394
00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:50.060
and you have to pay for it.
Oh my God.
Everybody got so angry that I watched.

395
00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:54.710
I just couldn't believe that this is all it took in the United States.
You know,

396
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:59.210
at a major airport.
Everyone was like bull shit.
And they're like,
all right,

397
00:25:59.211 --> 00:26:02.600
we'll pay for it.
Like they switched at the,
at the counter.
Yeah.

398
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.230
Well they should pay for it because you bought a ticket for a specific service

399
00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:10.130
at a specific time.
No.
And now you're displacing people with small children,

400
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.830
guys like you.
You mean want to get back to your family?

401
00:26:12.831 --> 00:26:17.000
You don't want to spend the fucking near Detroit.
I domestic.

402
00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:22.130
I don't know why.
I mean,
I know a part of it is just like the incredible volume,

403
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.460
but domestically,
you know,

404
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:29.470
the u s airline industry is a fucking shit.

405
00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:34.250
And you know,
when you go anywhere and it's so much better,

406
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.300
I will tell you Canada and Middle East,
believe it or not,

407
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.360
of course better in South America.
Yes.
Way Better in Asia.

408
00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:45.510
Of course it's better everywhere in South Africa's fantastic docs here.
I know.

409
00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.480
So you k great.
Yeah,
it sucks.

410
00:26:48.481 --> 00:26:52.320
Dog Balls here and they have a monopoly and they can draw our shit from an

411
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:56.940
another cut and you're coming here,
get ready.
Know that it will suck.

412
00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:01.860
It will send,
they don't care.
They don't fucking care.
They have you by the balls,

413
00:27:01.861 --> 00:27:03.480
they have you hostage.
You know,

414
00:27:03.481 --> 00:27:06.970
it's a bummer that Branson's airline didn't work out domestically.
Yeah.

415
00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:11.580
I think he's folding.
Right.
But um,
I think he,
I don't,
I don't think sold it.
Oh,

416
00:27:11.581 --> 00:27:15.090
okay.
I mean he did a great job though.
Alaska air or something.
Ah,

417
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.790
such it because virgin was my favorite one and I would always try it because he

418
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:19.441
brought a,

419
00:27:19.441 --> 00:27:24.441
tried to bring a little bit of the international airline flavor dignity.

420
00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:28.830
You mean treating the consumer like a,
like a customer,
like a valued,

421
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:30.560
but to see the whole thing.
I thought

422
00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:35.170
<v 0>it's,
it's that so many customers are animals,
you know?</v>

423
00:27:35.171 --> 00:27:39.070
I mean I'm around to of course,
so it like it,
you know,

424
00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:43.120
people are absolute pigs in airports.

425
00:27:43.121 --> 00:27:45.460
You see it all the time.
Sure.
There,

426
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.400
there are some of them treat the employees horrifically.

427
00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:52.480
Of course employees then treat the customers horrifically.
It's just,

428
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:54.970
it's overcrowded.
It's um,
you know,

429
00:27:54.971 --> 00:27:59.710
they make the planes too crowded.
It's too small because there,

430
00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:04.300
there's somebody that measured and found out you can stick extra seats in and

431
00:28:04.301 --> 00:28:08.470
you can sell those for this amount.
So it's like people are cramped there,

432
00:28:08.471 --> 00:28:12.610
they're not getting treated well and there and it's a hustle,
hustle,
hustle.

433
00:28:12.611 --> 00:28:16.120
Like land this plane,
flip it around.
Turnaround.
I don't know,
it's just,

434
00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:18.640
it's a whole shit show of an industry.

435
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:21.060
<v 3>It is a shit show.
Now on the positive side,</v>

436
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:25.920
the cost of tickets has really not resin that much in the last,

437
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:31.020
it's really amazing when you interface,
you can fly across the country for what,

438
00:28:31.021 --> 00:28:34.620
$450.
That's an incredible thing.
It is amazing.

439
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:37.560
Now they kept the prices low,
which is great.
In La,

440
00:28:37.561 --> 00:28:42.561
you can fly to San Francisco for like $100 or $50 on southwest if you,

441
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:49.500
uh,
Vegas saying,
yeah.
I mean that's,
that's really insane.
That is insane.

442
00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:50.670
That would take you,

443
00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:54.480
<v 0>you know,
five hours to one or probably three and a half,</v>

444
00:28:54.481 --> 00:28:58.620
four to the other to drive.
They're like,
pay $100.

445
00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.910
<v 3>It's,
it's ridiculous.
But that is pretty,
that is miraculous.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

446
00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:06.540
I never understand how they lose your bag so that,
that one always astounded me.

447
00:29:06.541 --> 00:29:09.960
Like it's a direct flight from here to Atlanta.
How the fuck did I not,

448
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:14.910
my bag just didn't make it.
Yeah.
That did happen to me once,

449
00:29:14.911 --> 00:29:19.320
but then it showed up like two weeks later.
The bank.
Yeah.
Anyways.

450
00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:23.220
Um,
but that makes me crazy.
Oh,
you know what else makes me crazy?

451
00:29:23.221 --> 00:29:27.150
The inefficiency of show business like a really crazy,

452
00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:30.690
it really is the only gonna to make your brain melt if you've never been around

453
00:29:30.691 --> 00:29:35.610
this thing.
The millions of dollars.
Yes.
Year.
That there's no,

454
00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.400
um,
you know,
in most of most

455
00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:42.520
<v 0>you who have a regular job have some form of courtesy in your job,</v>

456
00:29:44.321 --> 00:29:46.150
meaning that,
you know,

457
00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:51.880
somebody calls you and you go leaves you a message like a,

458
00:29:51.881 --> 00:29:53.050
I dunno if we're going to,
you know,

459
00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:56.890
I'd like to work out this deal where you guys sell us this and let's say you're

460
00:29:56.891 --> 00:29:59.080
not,
most people go,
oh,

461
00:29:59.081 --> 00:30:02.830
I'll call that person back and just tell them that we are not going

462
00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.430
<v 3>do the deal.
Right,
right.
Oh,</v>

463
00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:09.010
that's called courtesy common courtesy.
That shit

464
00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:10.580
<v 0>absolutely doesn't exist.</v>

465
00:30:10.581 --> 00:30:15.110
And it's one of the things is taking me the longest to get used to that.

466
00:30:15.111 --> 00:30:19.100
If you don't want to do something with somebody,

467
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:20.190
you just ignore them.

468
00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:21.350
<v 3>You ignore them.
Well,</v>

469
00:30:21.351 --> 00:30:25.310
I'm talking about the actual monetary inefficiency of shoots and productions,

470
00:30:25.311 --> 00:30:29.450
for instance,
are crazy.
Like your call time.
There'll be like,
Tom,

471
00:30:29.451 --> 00:30:32.840
you got to get here at five o'clock.
I'm on in Santa Monica,

472
00:30:32.841 --> 00:30:34.670
so you're sitting in rush hour traffic,
you're getting there,

473
00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:38.390
and then you sit in the trailer for five hours because they don't need you until

474
00:30:38.391 --> 00:30:42.050
11:00 PM.
But you gotta be there at five.
It's always like,

475
00:30:42.051 --> 00:30:45.320
let's just get people here or,
but don't,
don't get me there.

476
00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:49.670
Or The star who doesn't show up.
And you've got guys like the,

477
00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:52.610
the unionized crew who's been there since five in the morning.

478
00:30:52.611 --> 00:30:54.350
I worked on a television show.
I won't say who this is,

479
00:30:54.351 --> 00:30:57.590
but you've got the union guys who are putting together the sets,

480
00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.530
breaking shit down every night.
They're there before anybody.

481
00:31:00.531 --> 00:31:04.070
They've not slept there.
They're there,
they're making everything perfect.

482
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.821
Lighting Camera.

483
00:31:04.821 --> 00:31:08.530
And then the star doesn't show up because they decided they needed to sleep more

484
00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:09.383
that day.
Yeah.

485
00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:13.850
And everyone else waits for them and it's acceptable throwing money like out.

486
00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:17.510
It's crazy.
Here's the other one that annoys me.
Doctors.

487
00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:19.730
Doctors are the,

488
00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:24.710
it's the only business where you can just make people wait for fucking hours.

489
00:31:24.711 --> 00:31:28.970
Like how many?
One time we went to go get a scan when I was pregnant.
I mean,

490
00:31:28.971 --> 00:31:32.930
we waited for two hours.
Almost just the doctor didn't.

491
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.900
Doctor's not there.
Oh No,
no.
You gotta be on time.
Yeah.

492
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:41.060
He gets to come in and do his thing with you whenever he feels like intellectual

493
00:31:41.061 --> 00:31:42.230
arrogance is what it is.

494
00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:44.293
<v 0>No,</v>

495
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:49.330
that they're special and they know that they have the skill that can make you

496
00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.780
wait.
Yeah.
Because if you,
if you go like,
you know

497
00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:57.380
<v 3>hurts and I don't like how can this not hurt?
And they were like,</v>

498
00:31:57.381 --> 00:31:59.060
you got to come see me to make it not hurt.

499
00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:01.790
And then you go there and you're like,
I'm here.
When you said to me,

500
00:32:01.791 --> 00:32:03.650
and they're like,
well,
it's when I'm ready.

501
00:32:03.651 --> 00:32:06.740
When you sit in the waiting room for yeah.
For half an hour to 45 minutes.

502
00:32:06.741 --> 00:32:08.630
I know we should do to get back at doctors.

503
00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:12.530
Just make them wait for everything else.
Like if you make an,

504
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:15.920
if you're a doctor and you make an appointment with anyone,

505
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:19.150
they should see a doctor and your name and be like,
oh,
I'll just make you wait.

506
00:32:19.151 --> 00:32:21.920
You wait,
you wait in this room and then we'll make you wait in this other room.

507
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:24.660
Yeah.
Like you're like,
Hey,
uh,
I didn't want to upgrade my phone.

508
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:29.180
I'm doctor a and they're like,
oh yeah,
yeah.
Just uh,
just stand right there.

509
00:32:29.181 --> 00:32:32.870
I'll get this damn there.
Yeah.
And then like 45 minutes later I'd be like,
yeah,

510
00:32:32.871 --> 00:32:37.210
we're going to get to,
I just talked to her phone.
Um,

511
00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:41.300
or you want to get your oil changed after Matthews?
Gosh,
yeah,
yeah.

512
00:32:41.301 --> 00:32:44.400
There's no one here,
but I'm just wait there.
Just wait.
Like,

513
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:49.450
could you imagine if if you or I showed up late to our jobs of entertaining

514
00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:55.160
hundreds of painful.
Yeah.
I think that's,
it's so disrespectful.
It makes me crazy.

515
00:32:55.280 --> 00:33:00.140
Low roof.
Lauren Hill and then,
um,
guns and roses.

516
00:33:00.141 --> 00:33:03.380
What's his name?
Axl Rose would show up hours.
Late hours.

517
00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:06.380
You and a half crazy.
But could you imagine,

518
00:33:06.381 --> 00:33:09.560
you and I should have an hour late for our standard.
Like you,
we'd be fired.

519
00:33:09.561 --> 00:33:13.310
People was showing up pretty late for awhile.
That was the word on the street.

520
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:16.880
People would get pissed too.
Yeah.
He showed up super late for one of his,

521
00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:20.870
not this last special,
but the one before that.
He showed up hours later.

522
00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:23.660
Craziness.
People have invested in you.

523
00:33:23.661 --> 00:33:27.020
They've gotten babysitters because there's people that want to support you.

524
00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:30.530
It's like,
it's not like they're just waiting.
Let's go out tonight.
They're like,

525
00:33:30.531 --> 00:33:34.460
you specifically,
I want to give you money to see you do this thing.

526
00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:38.070
That's so funny.
I don't know.
It's nuts.
Um,
can we talk about our yeah.

527
00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.030
<v 5>Shifts in a fall.
What about</v>

528
00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:54.120
<v 3>a cat eating kibble?
Yeah.
Find it not ready.
Um,</v>

529
00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:57.780
but I'd,
I would play the cat eating kibble to know,

530
00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:01.590
imagine the sound.
This is a,
if you'd have it,

531
00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:05.170
if you don't follow us on Instagram or Twitter,

532
00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:08.480
which I'm sure a lot of people don't.
And they just listen or watch.

533
00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:13.610
This is the big news.
Go ahead,
gene me,
I get to tell.
Sure.
We've,
I'm very excited.

534
00:34:13.611 --> 00:34:17.090
We've been keeping it under our hats,
so to speak for a while.

535
00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:22.480
But gene and I have sold a pilot to CBS and we're going to be writing a script

536
00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:32.420
for a Sitcom with the fabulous Scott Martyr who,
uh,

537
00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:36.770
worked on always sunny in Philadelphia and the mic mic.
Yeah.

538
00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:42.020
And he is working with us now to develop a show based on your mom's house.
Yeah.

539
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:46.460
It's pretty exciting stuff.
Crazy.
Right?
A lot of people set congratulations.

540
00:34:46.461 --> 00:34:48.350
We really appreciate it.
So exciting.

541
00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:52.490
Some people let us know how it won't work.
Appreciate that too.

542
00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:58.850
Um,
yeah,
it's um,
it's,
it's,
you know,

543
00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:03.910
it's based on basically these gene and I and our relationship and how we,

544
00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:09.680
you know,
how we obsess on the little things and um,
this show,

545
00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.180
all of a sudden you're like,
look,

546
00:35:11.181 --> 00:35:15.380
are we going to do a guy coming in four strokes?
Probably not on CBS,

547
00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:20.270
but I don't think we would do that anywhere.
Honestly.
This,
it's too crazy.
Well,

548
00:35:20.271 --> 00:35:23.360
no.
So I mean it's just like what,
that's,
there's some things,

549
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:27.770
some jokes that you play that play well for this medium.

550
00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:28.700
Like worse.

551
00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:33.700
The joke and the execution of it works on a podcast and then some of them you

552
00:35:33.771 --> 00:35:37.920
go,
oh,
that can translate to television.
And some of them don't.

553
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:41.760
It's not that coming for strokes definitely can translate.

554
00:35:41.761 --> 00:35:46.761
It's like you go well playing that guy's drops and stuff like it works well in

555
00:35:47.251 --> 00:35:52.050
this medium,
but that doesn't mean we're not going to have fun and try to um,

556
00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:56.590
you know,
go after the things that make us laugh.
Wearing jeans extra time.
Yeah,

557
00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:00.990
no,
it's super exciting.
And I just want,
we want to clarify it too.

558
00:36:00.991 --> 00:36:05.580
A lot of people think,
oh,
you guys gotta when's your TV show on CBS?

559
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:08.280
It's not that far yet.
It's just a pilot script.

560
00:36:08.281 --> 00:36:12.630
So we're just writing it and then they have the option to make it into a pilot

561
00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:15.030
to her,
that pilot to not hear that pilot.
Yeah.

562
00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:18.900
So it's just a script deal for now.
Yeah,
exactly.
Very exciting.

563
00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:21.150
It doesn't mean that the show is ordered,
which a lot of people,

564
00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:24.360
I understand why he would think that,
but that's a little confusing.

565
00:36:24.361 --> 00:36:28.240
The language sometimes if you're not familiar with it,
but it's a,

566
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.410
it's very exciting.
And we were pitching it and I was like,
oh,

567
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:35.490
I was days away from my due date and we were pitching.
It's all these networks.

568
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:40.040
And it was,
people were buying it in the room.
It was crazy.
It was great.
Yeah.

569
00:36:40.041 --> 00:36:44.790
I mean,
I think there's a lot of stuff.
So have you,
this was like,
you know,

570
00:36:44.791 --> 00:36:47.960
the only time it multiple networks were like,
why don't you do it here?
Yeah.

571
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:54.030
It was very exciting.
And I'm excited to be with CBS.
I love,
uh,

572
00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:56.370
I love them.
I like a lot of the stuff that they're,

573
00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:00.930
they're airing right now actually.
Yeah.
Um,
but it's,
it's a big deal.

574
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.840
It's kind of,
it's kind of a big deal.
It's kind of exciting

575
00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:08.970
and I'm glad I didn't go into Labor during those meetings because it was,

576
00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:12.030
it was imminent.
Yeah.
It was so crazy.

577
00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:16.080
I literally could have gone into labor as we were doing those meetings.

578
00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:20.960
I'm not a good idea.
Um,
yeah.
So it's,

579
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:24.300
it's really exciting news.
I think we're going to,
you know,
have,

580
00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:29.250
have a fun time trying to get it done and trying it out,
trying it out,

581
00:37:29.251 --> 00:37:33.020
trying to,
trying to try it out,
try it,
try it out.
And we'll,
um,

582
00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:38.160
hopefully have success in it.
And,
um,
you know,

583
00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:42.610
it's something we've never done multicam show,
but no,

584
00:37:42.611 --> 00:37:45.630
but I like a live studio audience.
I do.
I just do.
I love it.

585
00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:49.350
When I was thinking about that,
I've done the,
uh,

586
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:54.720
the run on the single camera stuff and it's fun to pursue and you know,

587
00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:56.400
go after it.
But I don't know,

588
00:37:56.401 --> 00:38:00.150
our natural element is definitely doing standup

589
00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:06.660
comics tend to thrive is when there's a live studio audience and I don't know,

590
00:38:06.661 --> 00:38:10.140
I liked that tradition of it and I'm excited.

591
00:38:10.141 --> 00:38:14.310
I'm excited to bring some of the stuff from your mom's house to do.
I made sure.

592
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:19.860
Yeah.
I'm excited to find out how much stuff we can actually sneak in there.

593
00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:24.990
I know.
I also want to find that.
Exactly.
I want the,
um,
those sneaky moments.

594
00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:29.280
Try it out,
Tom,
try it out.
That's going to be fun.
What is this?

595
00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:33.870
It's a new drink and I'm like,
try it out.
Okay.
That'll be interesting.

596
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.100
We're going to take stuff from this

597
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:40.510
<v 0>show and make it into a show.
My Dad got a boat,
he's got a four stroke engine.</v>

598
00:38:40.511 --> 00:38:45.290
I'm pretty excited.
Little things like that where the works like,

599
00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:49.930
yeah,
you can say it.
Hello.

600
00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:53.760
It's always like just a wink at your mom's house audience.
Oh,

601
00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:58.220
it's going to be good.
Yeah.
It'll be fun man.
We'll see.
No,
it's gonna be great.

602
00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:03.170
So there it is and I'm no big day.

603
00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:07.070
Big Day.
Big Gene News.
Yeah,
it is exciting.
Sure.

604
00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:09.780
<v 3>I never thought,
I never,
like I said,</v>

605
00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:13.430
I never had that experience either and I've pitched many things and you and I

606
00:39:13.431 --> 00:39:17.510
walked into these big network meetings and we sold the show in the room.

607
00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:20.450
Like literally after we gave the pitch,
they're like,
we want it.
We're like,
what?

608
00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:22.700
Yeah,
you'd never happens.
It never happens.

609
00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:25.340
Not In my whole career and all this time.

610
00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:29.820
No one ever wants anything I'm doing except for now,
which is fantastic.

611
00:39:29.821 --> 00:39:32.180
And we know what we have the fans of this show to thank for it.

612
00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:34.670
Definitely that what you guys listening to us,

613
00:39:34.671 --> 00:39:37.970
we're just a couple of dickheads talking about farts are we still are.

614
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.380
We still are,
but yeah,

615
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:43.040
but now now we can talk about farts on CBS.

616
00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.850
<v 0>Quick Reminder.</v>

617
00:39:44.851 --> 00:39:49.851
We are streaming new episodes of this show every Tuesday at 9:00 PM Pacific.

618
00:39:50.791 --> 00:39:55.791
That's two hours before the youtube video drops and you can wash it with us.

619
00:39:56.731 --> 00:40:01.110
Blue Band is,
um,
is in there.
I joined last week.

620
00:40:01.111 --> 00:40:03.090
I'm at Dj Dad Mouth One.

621
00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.850
Sometimes Christina jumps in and she is queen genes one.
That's right.

622
00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.690
And we watch classic jeans on the weekends.

623
00:40:09.691 --> 00:40:14.691
It's twitch.tv/your mom's house podcast.

624
00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:20.280
Here's another Seagal.
F,
G,
t.
R.
T.
D.
Um,

625
00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:25.200
we gotta ask Bart what he thinks that stands for.
You know,

626
00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:30.300
first good Tang replaces that Dick.
There's so many versions.
Uh,

627
00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.220
somebody wrote,
uh,

628
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:37.740
that gt RTD is fat girls twerking round that deck.
Yup.
That works.

629
00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:42.300
Finna gargle that rancid tasting Dick.
Yeah,

630
00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:46.500
that's a from William from gums to really tight dentures.

631
00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:52.590
Chris.
Uh,
for genital time reach top drawer.

632
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.780
Fine guys that really throw Dick.
Yeah.

633
00:40:57.030 --> 00:41:01.050
Face goes to rear to delight.
Oh,
I like that.

634
00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:05.190
Those are all from Mike right there.
Thanks Mike.
Yeah,
so really interesting.
Oh,

635
00:41:05.191 --> 00:41:09.600
I finally got the,
um,
the answer to,

636
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:14.190
uh,
let me see if this is here.
Oh yeah.
Uh,

637
00:41:14.191 --> 00:41:18.330
you know that this guy,
right?
The infamous.
Yes,
I know.
I know.

638
00:41:18.331 --> 00:41:21.990
Watch this several times.
Yeah,
it's burned into my brain.
These there.

639
00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.033
Why is he not here?

640
00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:27.200
<v 7>Don't worry.
Mary is here.</v>

641
00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:49.760
<v 3>Okay,
so</v>

642
00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:58.550
this won't be in the CBS.
We're not,

643
00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:02.900
we're not writing this into our show.
Oh Shit,
I've never,

644
00:42:02.901 --> 00:42:06.300
I've mentioned that like,
oh,
it'd be great to understand the hell he said.

645
00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:10.160
Oh it's a really fully,
fully milk.
The moment.
Hi Tommy.

646
00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:12.680
To really understand this man stuff right here.
It is.

647
00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:17.330
So I've been watching some of your past episodes now is Tom really enjoys the

648
00:42:17.331 --> 00:42:19.460
video of the garage worker getting backed into,

649
00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:24.650
I'm a Canadian living in Taiwan with my wife that my wife could translate cause

650
00:42:24.651 --> 00:42:26.280
he got spooked speaking broken Chinese.

651
00:42:26.281 --> 00:42:30.200
She said that he just yells in pain and the last thing he says,

652
00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:32.480
which is what this guy says,
what Tom wished,

653
00:42:32.481 --> 00:42:37.040
he knew what he was saying is stuck in broken Chinese.
No Grammar.
Just stuck.

654
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:40.580
So he's saying that he's stuck.
She found a link.
This is,

655
00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:41.660
I've mentioned this before.

656
00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:45.530
She found a link to the news footage because it happened in Taiwan and it said

657
00:42:45.531 --> 00:42:48.560
the worker didn't have any major injuries.
Just bruises.

658
00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:52.120
Thank God [inaudible] Fan Mike.
So that's pretty cool.

659
00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:54.410
I'm relieved to hear that that guy didn't have any major.

660
00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:57.830
A lot of people had asked about that over the years and uh,
he didn't,

661
00:42:57.831 --> 00:43:02.030
he didn't have any major injuries.
God.
Yeah.
Well,
does that make that,

662
00:43:02.031 --> 00:43:05.890
but then then does that disappoint you?
Like,
or you bomb that he's not super,
no.

663
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:09.500
No.
Do you like it when they get hurt in real life or no,

664
00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:11.750
I don't want them to be really hurt.
That is funny though,

665
00:43:11.751 --> 00:43:15.660
that he's not crippled now.
Right.
Oh,

666
00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:20.460
see you do like that he's crippled Tom.
The guy's in a wheelchair.
No,
no.
I,

667
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:22.130
I liked that.
He's not really heard.
Of course.

668
00:43:22.131 --> 00:43:25.460
I don't want them to be really hurt,
but it's still a funny,
funny moment.
Yeah,

669
00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:29.690
I'm stuck.
I'm stuck.
I'm going to pitch stuff like this for the show them.

670
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:35.240
Maybe the executives would like that.
Of course.
If they have a sense of humor.

671
00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:38.670
Tom,
Tom laughs,
Taiwanese man by the way.
You were right.

672
00:43:38.671 --> 00:43:42.140
I got a lot of messages like Christine is a real stick in the mud.
Of course.

673
00:43:42.141 --> 00:43:45.350
That's how it was spelled.
My Casey Anthony Oj bit and they were like,

674
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:48.810
it's hilarious Christina.
No Fun scene as a square,
whatever.

675
00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:52.290
Nerd alert doesn't like the fun things and like I need that broad of here.

676
00:43:52.291 --> 00:43:55.340
I know guys.
I believe me.
Did I predict it?
Yeah,
you did.

677
00:43:55.341 --> 00:43:58.820
You said it was going to sound ridiculous.
Did happen.
Um,

678
00:43:58.821 --> 00:44:03.210
it says Jenny was a gutter slut.
Um,
Jenny,
yeah.
Yeah.
With Forrest.

679
00:44:03.211 --> 00:44:06.560
She knew what she was doing.
She took advantage of forest inability.
Well,

680
00:44:06.561 --> 00:44:08.870
let's back it up the people.
So when we're talking about,

681
00:44:08.871 --> 00:44:13.190
so last week we discussed whether or not it's fair to date and ethical,

682
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:14.270
unethical to,

683
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:18.530
to date a very attractive mentally challenged person.

684
00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:23.770
We brought up Slingblade and Forrest Gump as being not necessarily very

685
00:44:23.901 --> 00:44:26.900
attractive,
but just,
you know,
please Tom Hanks.
I mean,

686
00:44:26.901 --> 00:44:30.590
at the end of the days he's a leading man.
He's leading man the track.
Yeah,

687
00:44:30.591 --> 00:44:34.800
it kind of messed up the Jenny Jenny.
First of all didn't,

688
00:44:34.801 --> 00:44:38.590
didn't she had HIV?
Uh Oh I guess she didn't give it to this forest,

689
00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:41.400
but we don't know anything here.
This is what the email says.
Right.

690
00:44:41.401 --> 00:44:44.730
So we talked about them and read their selfish woman whether or not Jenny was

691
00:44:44.731 --> 00:44:48.260
being a real CNX Tuesday.
Right.
So it said

692
00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.890
fourth didn't have the ability to recognize the damage slot bag.

693
00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:55.200
She only wanted to reproduce.

694
00:44:55.201 --> 00:44:58.530
So she took advantage of a mentally challenged ma'am cause he was the only

695
00:44:58.531 --> 00:45:01.890
person left that would touch her HIV invested box near he got,

696
00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:06.570
Tony represents all the women who keep a nice guy on the back burner in their

697
00:45:06.571 --> 00:45:10.740
prime.
They go out,
they built hundreds of hippies.
They shoot heroin,

698
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.950
they joined the Black Panthers.
They contemplate suicide.

699
00:45:13.951 --> 00:45:17.520
They can track several STDs and then they realize their life is nothing.

700
00:45:17.521 --> 00:45:20.040
They need to settle down before the age takes over and they die.

701
00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:23.520
They come crawling back to the nice guy on the back burner,
back burner.

702
00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:27.570
It was always adored.
The priests let version.
They are now damaged goods,

703
00:45:27.571 --> 00:45:30.030
but the nice guy doesn't know about all the coke binges,

704
00:45:30.031 --> 00:45:32.730
acid trips and gang bang.
She accumulated over the years.

705
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:37.800
All four cs is that young girl that protected him from being teased and showed

706
00:45:37.801 --> 00:45:41.820
him his first pair of tits forest would have been better off becoming gay

707
00:45:41.821 --> 00:45:45.930
pirates with Lieutenant Dan,
pillaging other boats for their shrimp and booty.

708
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:47.081
If you ask me,

709
00:45:47.081 --> 00:45:50.370
that sounds much better than being a single parent living in bumble.

710
00:45:50.371 --> 00:45:53.400
Fuck Alabama trudat raising this autistic child.

711
00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:56.790
I didn't know that was a thing by yourself because you're dead.

712
00:45:56.791 --> 00:46:00.480
Gypsy wife could stay away.
Confetti needles,
dirty needles,
and random cock.

713
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:05.280
Congrats on the CBS pilot,
Kyle.
Well,
that's a very nice email,
Kyle,

714
00:46:05.281 --> 00:46:09.000
and and interesting observations on your part.
Well,
it is kind of a refreshing,

715
00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:14.310
refreshing take on a movie that people really just did back flips for it,

716
00:46:14.311 --> 00:46:19.260
but now you say it that way.
Jenny is kind of a selfish twat.
I mean,
yeah.

717
00:46:19.261 --> 00:46:21.960
Forest fell in love with her when she was pure and sweet and then she went,

718
00:46:21.961 --> 00:46:26.490
ran off and it became a slut burger and then decided last minute.
Yeah,

719
00:46:26.491 --> 00:46:30.570
I need to,
I need to have a baby.
I'll just take advantage of this nice dunk dope.

720
00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:34.290
Who's been waiting in the wings?
It's typical hot girl behavior.

721
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:39.270
Totally typical hot girl.
She took advantage of him and yeah,
and she knows,

722
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:44.520
she knows she's got them,
you know,
no questions.
We got to rename that.

723
00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:50.220
Jenny's Jenny's a slut burger Forrest Gump with the hoe ass Hoe gutters let

724
00:46:50.221 --> 00:46:54.540
Jenny.
Yeah,
now I'm mad for forest because I feel like he deserves better dude.

725
00:46:54.541 --> 00:46:57.990
He's or he deserve way better than Jenny.
Yeah,
I agree.

726
00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:00.630
If I ever meet Tom Hanks and would talk to them about it too,

727
00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:03.480
I'm going to talk to Jenny about it.
Oh,
speaking of my movie star lifestyle,

728
00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:07.240
I don't know if I mentioned it last time,
but the uh,

729
00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:12.690
the mood that I'm in called instant family has been moved up three months on the

730
00:47:14.911 --> 00:47:17.250
show.
So it was going to be a February release.

731
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:21.810
It's now November 16th which is very exciting.
We went to the screening.

732
00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:22.673
It's a great movie,

733
00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:26.400
and I'm not just saying this because you're my husband and I adore you,

734
00:47:26.401 --> 00:47:29.530
and if I need to be infinitely talented,
you're amazing in this movie.

735
00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:32.230
You are amazing.
You're so funny.
You're the funniest part of it,

736
00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:37.360
but it's a really good movie.
The movie is solid.
I mean,

737
00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:41.830
I cried.
I don't see what moves me to tears.
I have.

738
00:47:41.831 --> 00:47:46.600
I made a big shits and big tests.
I have Teflon in my,

739
00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:50.770
in my veins.
I cried like a baby during this.
It's a,

740
00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:54.100
it's a beautiful movie and it's so funny.
It's got so much heart.

741
00:47:54.101 --> 00:47:57.880
It's a great holiday movie.
I'm so excited for people to see this.
I can't wait.

742
00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.790
It's so good.
And you're so good in it.
The one thing,

743
00:48:00.791 --> 00:48:03.670
it's weird and you guys are going to notice that his beard is so dark.

744
00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:07.810
They took the gray out of your beard.
So I was like,
when I saw you,

745
00:48:07.811 --> 00:48:11.850
I was startled.
I'm like,
that's not my gene.
It's true.

746
00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:14.890
It's pretty amazing.
And your character is so funny.

747
00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:17.140
And they dress you like such a Chachi.
I love it.

748
00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:21.610
It's so funny to see you being a fucking deg.
That Dick Character.
It's great.

749
00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:24.700
Yeah,
that's,
that's your wheelhouse asshole.
But I'm very excited.

750
00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:28.390
I'm very excited that it comes out in November and I think it's going to be,

751
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:31.660
I dunno,
I think it's going to be a big movie guys.

752
00:48:31.661 --> 00:48:35.890
I got to meet Mark Walberg had the screening and he shook my hand.

753
00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:39.190
Mark and I are part of the 4:00 AM club.
You know what that is?

754
00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:43.240
I follow him on Instagram.
We get up every day and we work out.

755
00:48:43.241 --> 00:48:45.810
Do not get up before I am.
Yes we do.
Mark and I work out.

756
00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.280
I think we text each other workout and he goes,
me too.

757
00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:51.670
And then we work out and we have a good time.
That guy is up legit.

758
00:48:51.671 --> 00:48:56.440
FYM cause I see what time he posts up before then.
He just really nuts.

759
00:48:56.441 --> 00:48:59.860
He works out a lot.
Oh,
you should have seen us during the movie every day.

760
00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:05.630
Do you think,
um,
we should fitness shame him.
You're making too much fitness,

761
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:10.240
much fitness.
It would not affect them for sure.
He makes serious fitness,

762
00:49:10.241 --> 00:49:14.630
but he looks amazing.
He does.
He's 47.
That's cray too.

763
00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:19.090
He makes a fitness everyday like that.
Huh?
He's doing right now 47 days in a row.

764
00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:20.620
Like because he's 47,

765
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:26.290
47 days in a row of getting up at three something to work on making fitness,

766
00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:30.250
fitness.
I go to bed you think probably pretty early at seven.

767
00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:33.280
I think he's in bed pretty early.
A guy takes care of themselves.

768
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:34.980
See how many hours is that?

769
00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:40.810
You have to go to bed super early to get eight hours of 7:00 PM.

770
00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:44.230
He probably his shit,
he probably is.

771
00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:48.580
That guy is really dedicated to the fitness game.
He is.
Um,
yeah.

772
00:49:48.581 --> 00:49:52.090
Fuck Jenny.
Nah,
Nah,
Nah.
I think about her.
She's fairly selfish.

773
00:49:52.091 --> 00:49:54.760
Twice ever meet Robin.
Write him and tell him the same thing.
Hey,

774
00:49:54.761 --> 00:49:57.700
Jenny was up fucking selfish.
Gutter slut.
Really.

775
00:49:58.110 --> 00:50:02.920
Now how's the farts is coming back and Jenny is starring in it without,
uh,

776
00:50:02.921 --> 00:50:07.120
what's his dick,
Kevin because of his Kevin,
because of his whole thing.

777
00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:11.590
Do you know the gay Kevin's movie?
Um,
but fucking Kevin,

778
00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:14.290
but fucking Kevin came out this weekend.

779
00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:17.060
He's in this movie called billionaire boys club,
which was,

780
00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:21.850
which was a VOD before it hit theaters.
What's actually VOD?

781
00:50:21.851 --> 00:50:24.880
That's industry slang for video on demand.

782
00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:30.470
But I'm a movie star laying the movie.
He's not the star of the movie,

783
00:50:30.471 --> 00:50:32.900
but he's definitely the most high profile person of the movie.

784
00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:38.830
And it premiered this past weekend in 10 theaters and it made $287 what?

785
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.250
Yeah.
Are you fucking kidding me?
No,

786
00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:47.450
I'm 100% serious as the exact amount.

787
00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:51.140
And do you think it's because people don't like Kevin Spacey because of the

788
00:50:51.141 --> 00:50:55.160
scandal?
The thing,
the two probably a big part of it.
I think you know what?

789
00:50:55.161 --> 00:50:58.040
But that billionaire boys club,
that's a remake from the eighties it is.

790
00:50:58.041 --> 00:50:59.840
And then like I said,
he's not the,

791
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:01.670
like the movie was made two and a half years ago,

792
00:51:01.671 --> 00:51:06.000
so it was before the scandal and he's not the main person in the movie.

793
00:51:06.001 --> 00:51:08.500
It's that they didn't take him out of the trailer because we watched the
trailer,

794
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:10.840
the kid take him out.
He's in the movie and they're not gonna.

795
00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:14.150
They don't have the resources to reshoot the movie.

796
00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:19.520
I'm saying that the main guy in the movie is actually the kid from a baby baby

797
00:51:19.521 --> 00:51:23.990
driver movie that was,
um,
yeah,
so he's,
he's actually,

798
00:51:23.991 --> 00:51:27.740
I think the star of the movie.
But anyway,

799
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:30.650
to movie just tanked though,
I think too.

800
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:35.330
It's not in the Zeitgeists and the eighties people wanted to see movies about

801
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:38.510
kids being wealthy and shit decks and now it's like,

802
00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:43.310
it's kind of reminds you of have you just not,
it's not,
maybe it's the time.

803
00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:47.480
It's nobody wants to get shit right now.
We've got this email,
Jane at said,

804
00:51:47.481 --> 00:51:51.200
I've listened to every episode from day one,
way before fucking camp.

805
00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:52.850
I'm in the middle of moving out,

806
00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:58.240
listening with my headphones to mom's house podcast episodes three 33 through

807
00:51:59.450 --> 00:52:02.480
three 40 laughing my ass off my,

808
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:07.630
but my fuckboy polyamorous neighbors came over with a beer and said they were

809
00:52:07.821 --> 00:52:11.300
sorry.
At first I was confused,
but then they said,

810
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:13.070
we thought you were crying.

811
00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:18.470
I guess that's what it sounds like when you listened to your mom's house alone

812
00:52:18.471 --> 00:52:22.760
in your house with headphones on.
I have to get back to fucking camp later.

813
00:52:22.761 --> 00:52:25.430
Mommies and manual.
Isn't that funny?

814
00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:30.350
Man Camp was one of my favorite drops.
Oh yeah.

815
00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:32.990
That's from a Tourette syndrome.

816
00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:37.550
A documentary where this little girl that was just her who said that she gets

817
00:52:37.551 --> 00:52:38.750
sent to this camp and she goes,

818
00:52:38.751 --> 00:52:41.870
sometimes they go to tracks camp so that they're with other children who have

819
00:52:41.871 --> 00:52:45.200
the same thing.
Sometimes I say words.

820
00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:50.510
She swears like swear fucking camp.
Well,
she says another word.
What does she say,

821
00:52:50.511 --> 00:52:54.320
Tom?
She says a word.
It starts with an N.
Yeah.
Yeah.

822
00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:56.390
What nincompoop yeah,

823
00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:06.160
I mean,
yeah,
she's like eight years old.
Cute too.
Which way you're like I said,

824
00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:09.950
he swears he's swearing,
but she's hearing it somewhere.

825
00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:12.930
She's hearing that like our kid doesn't know that word.
Yeah.

826
00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:15.020
You know what I'm saying?
We all say that stuff at home.

827
00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:18.650
You know who probably does know that word though,

828
00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:25.820
or gusts?
I'm sure knows that word.
Her guests.
Our guests coming up.
Oh,
Bert.

829
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:29.750
Yeah,
I'm sure part.
Yeah.
You think he says it all the time?
Probably.
Okay.

830
00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:32.140
He's a fat racist.

831
00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:40.080
Baton races should be as next hour.
We should introduce him like that.
He's fat.

832
00:53:40.081 --> 00:53:44.730
He's racist.
I think he'd like that.
Oh,

833
00:53:44.731 --> 00:53:47.810
you hate that.
Let's do it.
I'm fat and I'm racist.

834
00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:52.440
I am surprised he doesn't have a TLC show,
you know,
and they,

835
00:53:52.441 --> 00:53:56.340
it's all fat people like the fattest comedian alive.
Follow him right now

836
00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:03.360
and he's like
Tito's.
Oh my God.
With the fucking drinking.

837
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:06.090
Why?
Why does everybody love Tito's?
What's the fucking,

838
00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:08.030
what's the deal with a Tito's?
I know.

839
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:11.520
I think there's some extra process they go through.

840
00:54:11.521 --> 00:54:15.450
I know it's made in the u s and I forget.
We'll ask him.
He's definitely not.

841
00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:18.120
He knows.
Yeah,
we should.
It's like,
it's like when everyone was drinking.

842
00:54:18.121 --> 00:54:21.660
Zima is in the nineties huh?
Hey,
here's a peak question.
Hey Jeans,

843
00:54:21.661 --> 00:54:24.520
I'm in the middle of a level five brown at the moment and I came,

844
00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:28.110
came across my mind.
That requires further investigation.

845
00:54:28.111 --> 00:54:31.110
Why is it you can pee without shitting,

846
00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:33.240
but you can't shoot the shit without peeing.

847
00:54:33.241 --> 00:54:36.150
I've never shit interesting without the preliminary piece stream.

848
00:54:36.151 --> 00:54:38.950
So it begs the question why?
Oh my God,
it's such a,

849
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:40.740
I would love to hear feedback from you.

850
00:54:40.741 --> 00:54:43.530
Maybe the p stream is the redheaded stepchild.

851
00:54:43.531 --> 00:54:47.130
Nobody talks about in the whole farts.
Push the shit out debate.

852
00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:48.450
Is there a deeper meaning?

853
00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:53.460
I need to know as always keep it high and tight.
Ps Tom,

854
00:54:53.461 --> 00:54:55.660
it's for sure the water champ.
Wait,
is that,

855
00:54:55.661 --> 00:54:59.950
is that a man thing to do you have to pee while sometimes.

856
00:54:59.951 --> 00:55:03.340
I mean when we discussed this before to you pee you shit and then you've made

857
00:55:03.341 --> 00:55:06.780
more p and you're like,
it's one of your favorite observations.

858
00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:11.320
But did I make more p or just as I was shitting or did that Pete,

859
00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:15.370
that was like the what's lingering be more good question.

860
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:17.280
But boys have the same problem,
right?

861
00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:21.170
That you have to pee while you share.
Yeah.

862
00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:28.950
Why is that?
Okay?
I have a theory.
I was okay.
Maybe the bowel muscle,

863
00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:33.180
it's bigger than the,
the the P O my soul.

864
00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:37.920
So when that muscle is relaxed,
it's adjacent to your bladder or I dunno,

865
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:42.030
I dunno.
Maybe everything relaxes down there.
That's good.

866
00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:45.730
It's a good doctor drew question.
We'll ask him that dropped down

867
00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:51.550
to hear this new one.
Dear Dr Drill,

868
00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:56.080
do you wanna see this clip of a Burt swimming?
Yeah.
So when you're ready,

869
00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:02.000
that's pretty cool.
I think you'll like it.
Okay.
Ready?
No,
I'm writing this down.

870
00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:05.540
Know that's the part that you got to.
How come I compete?
Well,

871
00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:08.250
I shit but not vice versa.
It's really interesting.

872
00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:18.410
Yeah.
That is nasty.

873
00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:23.180
That was a footage of a Bert look alike and he pooped in the ocean and he shot

874
00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:26.870
Charlotte diarrhea.
So much came out.
So much diarrhea.
Yeah.

875
00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.960
And he and only he knew the diarrhea came out.

876
00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:32.230
I think he kind of picked up on it,
Babe.
No,

877
00:56:32.231 --> 00:56:35.320
he didn't know because he doesn't look embarrassed.
He thinks he just farted,

878
00:56:35.321 --> 00:56:38.440
I think.
You think he thinks he just farted.
I'm looking at it.

879
00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:42.760
He's looking at his whole stream of shit.
Diarrhea.
Yeah.
Look.

880
00:56:42.761 --> 00:56:47.290
And then he's got it.
He's like,
I got to swim through it.

881
00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:51.040
So now he knows everywhere the Fisher.

882
00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:57.250
Can I ask you a question about hemorrhoids?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,

883
00:56:57.251 --> 00:57:00.310
I have them now and I'm like,
I'm trying to remember.

884
00:57:00.730 --> 00:57:03.580
I think they went away just naturally after I've been Ellis my way.

885
00:57:03.581 --> 00:57:06.800
I just want to put it out there.
I think this is a good Burt topic to,
Oh,
hold on.

886
00:57:06.801 --> 00:57:11.440
You do.
It definitely has hemorrhoids and probably has for decades.

887
00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:15.160
He's probably going to have so much insight in the hemorrhoids.
I mean,

888
00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:17.850
he's a guy.
You look at it and you know hemorrhoid.

889
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:21.100
Should I talk about it with this guy?
Yes,
he's definitely,
absolutely.
Okay.

890
00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:25.090
We'll save it for work done.
We're definitely gonna introduce him.

891
00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:26.560
Fat and racist.

892
00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:31.480
The fattest racist comedian alive.

893
00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:38.350
This guy uses the n word all the time.
Oh my God.

894
00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:40.210
Um,
remember this?

895
00:57:41.550 --> 00:57:45.870
<v 8>Yeah.
Shout out to Thomas and core row.
Yeah,</v>

896
00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:55.130
no,
sorry.
No,
sorry.

897
00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:00.820
<v 9>Yo Bird is fat finger blurt.
That two went up.</v>

898
00:58:00.821 --> 00:58:02.740
Strawberries like a fucking fool.

899
00:58:03.210 --> 00:58:07.460
<v 3>What have a new crazy lokes distract.
You're kidding.
Yeah.</v>

900
00:58:07.461 --> 00:58:11.420
He made it just for this appearance.
I'm so excited.
I can't wait.

901
00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:15.500
This is an old one here,
but I'm like,
oh shit.
I gotta go.

902
00:58:15.501 --> 00:58:18.320
I gotta take care of my [inaudible].
All right,
so here's the deal,
man.

903
00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:19.310
Here's the deal.

904
00:58:19.310 --> 00:58:24.310
We're gonna take a quick pause and as a deal man,

905
00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:29.860
we'll be back very soon with a huge drunk each fat,

906
00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:36.160
lazy shiftless comedian who will racist wheel in here,

907
00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:40.760
Republican House.
And uh,
now we're very excited about it.

908
00:58:40.761 --> 00:58:44.300
So we'll be right back with,
um,

909
00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:46.340
a burnt crystals.

910
00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:50.370
<v 7>Oh.</v>

911
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:56.800
<v 3>Oh my God.
All right.
We're back from the big pause with a,
he's drunk.</v>

912
00:58:56.801 --> 00:58:59.860
He's obscenely overweight.
He's intensely racist.

913
00:59:01.650 --> 00:59:05.350
<v 9>Hey guys,
it's so good to be here.
We were doing like,</v>

914
00:59:05.370 --> 00:59:10.230
they were like as good a good new river star.
These are safe births.
Oh,

915
00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:15.090
what's that?
Turn the AC.
It's,
well,
he's bigger.

916
00:59:15.091 --> 00:59:17.040
Larger people get hotter faster too.

917
00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:20.970
I did Marin's podcast the other day and he's got a new house at Martin's house.

918
00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:25.370
Oh,
good.
Good for him.
As I walked up to it and I was like,

919
00:59:25.371 --> 00:59:27.800
this isn't his house,
not mark.
Marin does not live here.

920
00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:30.590
I'm so glad he has a good house because last house was a pretty,

921
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:33.920
pretty shitty for how much money that guy probably makes.
Yeah.
And,
uh,
but,

922
00:59:33.930 --> 00:59:35.920
and then we went in and do his podcast and he was like,
I'm like,
oh,

923
00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:37.700
you got an AC in here.
He's like,
I gotta turn it off.

924
00:59:37.701 --> 00:59:41.630
And immediately I started pouring soil.
Of course our sweat bad.
I gotta tell you,

925
00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:42.110
I know there's,

926
00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:45.690
<v 0>so,
there's a bunch of stuff we're going to talk about.
I saw the special.
Okay.</v>

927
00:59:45.870 --> 00:59:49.530
Yeah.
I got an advanced screener of it was a celebrity.
Well,
here's the thing.

928
00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:54.390
A movie star or television star.
Highly in demand actor.
Writer,

929
00:59:54.391 --> 00:59:57.960
producer.
Yeah.
I just say I want to see something.
Boom.

930
00:59:58.020 --> 01:00:00.960
It arrives and I watched it and it's fucking awesome.

931
01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:01.970
<v 9>He did.
He hit his head.</v>

932
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.520
He had his ear buds and he was laughing and I was on the couch.
Thank you.

933
01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:08.900
I'll watch the front.
The back is,
I appreciate the shout out on the special.

934
01:00:08.901 --> 01:00:13.130
Thanks ladies.
I did.
I did watch it.

935
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:17.500
<v 0>I watched the whole thing,
man.
Um,
can I say or no?
Do I might ruin?
No,
no,</v>

936
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:21.350
you can go ahead.
Um,
well he a special thanks to,
to Teddy Tom.

937
01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:25.280
But here's the thing,
man.
It's so funny.
I think it's going to,

938
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:29.750
all your dreams are going to come true,
um,
for,
for your standup or your career.

939
01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:32.450
But like the coolest things for me watching it was like,

940
01:00:32.451 --> 01:00:35.150
there's a lot of funny jokes and funny bits.
Um,

941
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:38.340
I feel like it perfectly represents you.

942
01:00:38.550 --> 01:00:43.430
Like you are in the special who you are for real.
You know?

943
01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:47.330
And that's a cool thing to see.
Like I was like,
this is 100%,
cause you know,

944
01:00:47.331 --> 01:00:51.680
sometimes you could tape something,
shoot something and you're like,
oh fuck.

945
01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:55.010
Like that's not really who I am.
You know,
like,
or that didn't come out right.

946
01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:57.100
Yeah.
But this came out to be this is you

947
01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:00.150
<v 9>to thank you.
This might be the best.
I mean I got,
there's only,</v>

948
01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:04.090
I've never read reviews or anything and you want your friends to like it and so

949
01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:06.460
thank you.
No,
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna hit you hard here in a little bit.

950
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.370
It was a really fun,
I love the title.
I think it's such a great,

951
01:01:11.371 --> 01:01:14.980
it says exactly what you do.
Is Secrets all so fucking right throwback.

952
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:16.390
It's funny to call it a throwback.

953
01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:20.750
It's a throwback to when comedy specials that were funny.
Yeah.

954
01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:25.810
It's like somebody out there without,
there's no pretentious vibe.

955
01:01:25.811 --> 01:01:30.490
He's just like glamorous.
No,
it's just funny.
It's funny stories and funny jokes.

956
01:01:30.850 --> 01:01:34.820
Funny Guy.

Thank you.
Because I feel like,
I feel like,
uh,

957
01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:39.190
I sometimes I feel bummed out that I don't have like an angled that I'm

958
01:01:39.191 --> 01:01:42.860
preaching about days.
Everyone's got something to preach about and I just,

959
01:01:42.970 --> 01:01:45.640
it was for me,
it's just funny stories.
Don't get me wrong.
I didn't like it.

960
01:01:46.350 --> 01:01:49.630
I'm saying other people might like it.
Yeah.
It's really great.

961
01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:53.620
<v 0>Proud of you.
I'm very happy for you.
Um,
I have,
uh,</v>

962
01:01:53.650 --> 01:01:56.610
here's the audio thing they put out.
Where is it

963
01:02:04.650 --> 01:02:09.130
<v 10>only on Netflix?
A startling performance.</v>

964
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:13.330
One of the defining live shows most of our time,

965
01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:18.820
watch the comedy show the changed what comedy can be.

966
01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:25.580
The cultural impact of this special will be felt for generations to come

967
01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:29.640
handled.
Gatsby's

968
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:33.750
streaming on Netflix.

969
01:02:35.610 --> 01:02:40.410
Krajcir also has one out called secret time.

970
01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:47.520
<v 9>No,
you got to give it to Netflix marketing for that.
Oh,
I gotta get,</v>

971
01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:49.940
I gotta give a shout out to the,
uh,
the end of the,

972
01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:54.590
the end of the special as Tom Segura.
Oh Wow.
Thanks man.
Yeah,

973
01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:57.890
I think it's so funny.
I never,
I'd never take any jokes or anything for people.

974
01:02:57.891 --> 01:03:00.950
I just don't,
and uh,
Mark Norman,

975
01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:03.590
Shane Torres both gave me punch ups like,

976
01:03:03.591 --> 01:03:05.550
cause they were there when I was running this special.
Yeah.

977
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:07.800
And you gave me the end is the best thing

978
01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:11.930
cause I only got bits and pieces from what?
Like I said,

979
01:03:11.931 --> 01:03:13.820
Tom was watching it and I didn't have a chance to sit down.

980
01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:17.220
But I really love that you talk about Leanne.
I love that.

981
01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:21.150
Talking about your girls.
Oh by the way,
have you seen that?

982
01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:23.330
Nor were they got the taping.
Yeah,
they were there,

983
01:03:23.331 --> 01:03:26.600
but they didn't see them at the taping.
They did not see that.
I mean,

984
01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:34.170
especially now they,
they know what's going on for their babies.

985
01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:39.350
Their friends all have fucking Netflix.
They're going to be like,

986
01:03:39.351 --> 01:03:41.730
especially like your oldest is in high school district.

987
01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.880
She's in high school or friends or Netflix on their phone.

988
01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:47.360
They're going to be like,
oh,
your dad has something on Netflix.
Watch it.

989
01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:52.250
You believed in Santa Claus last year
and they're going to be like,
Hey,

990
01:03:52.251 --> 01:03:56.340
you need your dad said you're a fucking moron this you're dumber sister.

991
01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:01.240
Yeah,
I talk shit so much shit about that.
I had to go the,

992
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:03.500
I had to say to Georgia and I go,
listen,

993
01:04:03.530 --> 01:04:06.770
I talk about you guys on the special and I make jokes about,
you know,
I love you,

994
01:04:06.771 --> 01:04:09.250
right?
And they're like,
yeah.
And I go,
okay.
When I was like,
what do you got?

995
01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:10.700
What do you say about us?
I said,
well,

996
01:04:10.701 --> 01:04:12.680
the first thing I say is my daughters are fucking idiots.

997
01:04:12.830 --> 01:04:15.290
And they both started laughing and they were to or not idiots.
And I was like,

998
01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:16.281
well you are.

999
01:04:16.281 --> 01:04:18.620
And then I told them the stories that I told him the special and they're like,

1000
01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:21.080
okay,
I can see how that could make me look like an idiot.

1001
01:04:21.730 --> 01:04:23.480
But they're cool with it.
Yeah,
they're cool with it.
They're fine.

1002
01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:28.240
And Leanne totally is cool with it.
Oh yeah.
That's the least.

1003
01:04:28.790 --> 01:04:33.450
The lady whose name you give out your like,
you can Google him.
She's

1004
01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:37.370
obviously,
she bought a website,

1005
01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:40.610
grooves.com for this so she could make shirts to fuck with me.

1006
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:44.600
That's hilarious dude.
Yeah,
I that's,
that's fun.
She's cool.

1007
01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:47.990
Bling grooves in a color con and uh,
and I say she is,

1008
01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:51.170
I'm being dead serious because is she,
is,
she really is.
If you look at her face,

1009
01:04:51.350 --> 01:04:53.810
she's the girl I fuck with their car.
If you look at their face,
you're like,

1010
01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.660
oh yeah,
she,
you can see how she'd be a con.
Um,
I just,

1011
01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:00.800
I put stickers on our car and so like we,
I used to do it all the time and uh,

1012
01:05:00.801 --> 01:05:01.670
I would put like a,

1013
01:05:01.850 --> 01:05:05.210
make America great again when the election was going and she couldn't get them

1014
01:05:05.211 --> 01:05:09.500
off as she would lose her shit.
But yeah,
really fun.
The whole bit about,
I mean,

1015
01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:14.710
it's great man.
It's a great special thanks man.
You,
yeah,
it's a,

1016
01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:18.310
it's good.
You're gonna,
you're gonna have a,
I think a,
a fun time with this one,

1017
01:05:18.311 --> 01:05:22.270
man.
Thanks man.
That's the best compliment I've gotten you in Forbes magazine,

1018
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:23.470
Forbes magazine,

1019
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:28.510
Northlake night is this thing about me Forbes and they were like Burt's special

1020
01:05:29.441 --> 01:05:34.441
can this comedian can transcend a his party boy image into adulthood and I was

1021
01:05:35.861 --> 01:05:39.820
like,
whoa wait,
you're not going to start touring with a shirt or you know,

1022
01:05:40.410 --> 01:05:42.040
come on.
Matching how upset people would get.

1023
01:05:42.041 --> 01:05:45.400
Now like if you go on this 2019 tour and people are like,

1024
01:05:45.401 --> 01:05:49.450
we also like we all because you'd think that that showtime thing got you

1025
01:05:49.451 --> 01:05:50.650
exposure.
It's like this.

1026
01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:53.920
This could be a whole other level and then you walk out and you're like,
Nah,

1027
01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:56.210
I'm going to do the shark thing now.
People will be like,
why?

1028
01:05:56.211 --> 01:05:59.660
Why are you going to do Conan shirtless?
You have to own,

1029
01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:04.270
I guess I'll take my shirt off
doing it Monday.

1030
01:06:04.790 --> 01:06:07.790
I got to go shirtless,
dude.
I guess I have to

1031
01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:14.080
shirtless sitting cause like my belly man.
Machine of real.
Yeah,

1032
01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:19.300
of course.
Speaking of your wife and kids,

1033
01:06:19.301 --> 01:06:21.640
we were talking about this,
right?
What were we talking about?
We said,

1034
01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:22.540
well let's not forget it.

1035
01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:26.130
<v 2>Getting out of a 90 day Rehab facility.</v>

1036
01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:32.420
Struggling to treat your oversized liver checkout boot crushers,

1037
01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:38.120
one hour special secret time only on Netflix.

1038
01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:39.360
Great.
That's great.

1039
01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:44.610
<v 9>Good promos.
We,
where were we talking about before?</v>

1040
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:47.430
About how when we all kind of started hanging out together.

1041
01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:52.740
We lived in proximity to each other and at the time you just had Georgia.

1042
01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:56.490
Oh God no,
no.
You had to,
you had both kids when we met you.
But I was just like,

1043
01:06:56.491 --> 01:06:58.990
I knew him a little while before.
You knew.
I knew I,

1044
01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:02.580
I knew him before right before I was born.

1045
01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:07.590
Cause I remember baby aila coming to the green room at a club.
That's crazy.

1046
01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:11.590
I know.
And what was making 700 bucks a week?
That's clicking my workout.

1047
01:07:12.210 --> 01:07:15.930
That is so funny.
Like it scares me now.
Like I don't know what scares me now.

1048
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.920
More.
Uh,

1049
01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:21.960
the fact that Tom's going to be 55 when his kids go to high school or the fact

1050
01:07:21.961 --> 01:07:25.230
that I was broke as fuck with children thinking,
oh this will work out.

1051
01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:30.120
I can't believe it.
Two littles.
And they were so cute.
We come over and they'd be,

1052
01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:34.740
you know,
naked time nick of time and they're watching their cartoons.

1053
01:07:34.741 --> 01:07:35.660
I know people would ask us like,

1054
01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:38.450
why did you smoke cigarettes and gained so much weight back in that time?

1055
01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:42.690
I'm like I think cause I didn't think it was going to work out or like not that

1056
01:07:42.691 --> 01:07:45.930
he didn't think.
He's like,
you're like this is a really hard used to smoke.

1057
01:07:46.650 --> 01:07:47.580
I didn't smoke that much.

1058
01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:51.780
No I didn't know he didn't smoke that smoke around sets or like have a pre or

1059
01:07:51.781 --> 01:07:56.040
post and like no.
The thing is you think it's going to like,

1060
01:07:56.041 --> 01:08:00.600
you hope it's gonna work out,
but your reality of the living situation you're in,

1061
01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:05.370
you know you're,
yeah,
this is real man.
I'm at this better workout.

1062
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.960
I can't believe I did that.
Like now looking back I go,
that was a,

1063
01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:13.170
those really irresponsible,
so risky,
which is high risk,
high risk,
high reward.

1064
01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:15.980
Yeah.
And then now I go,
if I

1065
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.800
<v 11>could just get like two more years with this,
I'm done.</v>

1066
01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:22.370
You got to do this for another 15 years.
Two more years.
Two more years.

1067
01:08:22.371 --> 01:08:25.380
They stayed two more years of good touring and I can just coast,

1068
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:30.440
just coast to coast.
It's got living expenses.

1069
01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:35.720
I'll be hosting a game show.
I'm ready to sell out.
I'm so ready to sell out.

1070
01:08:36.030 --> 01:08:40.820
Yeah.
Brutal.
Yeah.
Is Hardy shift schedule is so dumb.

1071
01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:44.790
Yeah,
I know.
It's so dumb.
I don't know another way to do it.
Tell him why.

1072
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:49.230
<v 0>Let's tell him.
I mean,
I want,
here's the truth.
If I'm being honest,</v>

1073
01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.400
I know it's dumb because I did it dumb.
So that's why I know.

1074
01:08:53.530 --> 01:08:55.740
So like I know I'm not gonna give away anything,

1075
01:08:55.741 --> 01:08:58.410
but I know what's coming up for him and like

1076
01:08:58.850 --> 01:09:00.530
<v 11>you haven't,
you've only seen North America.</v>

1077
01:09:02.050 --> 01:09:04.610
<v 0>Do you know how,
do you know what that's going to?
It's a dude.</v>

1078
01:09:04.730 --> 01:09:06.200
I know there's a part of your thing.

1079
01:09:06.210 --> 01:09:08.360
I know there's a part of your thing coming up,
dude,

1080
01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:13.810
where I was looking at the dates and it was like one city Thursday and other

1081
01:09:13.851 --> 01:09:16.280
city fried and other city Saturday and other cities Sunday.
Then I'm like,

1082
01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:18.800
you have Monday,
Tuesday off another city,
Thursday and other city,

1083
01:09:18.801 --> 01:09:20.570
Friday and other side east side of it.
And I just said,
he's Sunday,

1084
01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:24.260
two days off in another city.
And they're like,
dude,
I'm telling you,

1085
01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:28.240
it's so much different than doing Columbus this week.
Oh,

1086
01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:29.420
a Hartford next week.

1087
01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:34.340
<v 11>It's been when I did that run with a bar,
got c for one weekend,</v>

1088
01:09:34.530 --> 01:09:39.000
one weekend,
I was a fucking mess.
You're going to do it for you know me.
I have,

1089
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:42.870
I have a tendency to allow myself treats when I haven't earned treats.

1090
01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:47.280
And so those mornings at the airport where I go,
I don't want to be here,

1091
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:50.640
my brain goes,
well,
why don't you go get yourself a treat?
And then I'm like,
okay,

1092
01:09:50.670 --> 01:09:52.110
Double Tito's and soda.
Sure.

1093
01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:56.970
I would tell him why is why I have no fucking idea.

1094
01:09:57.010 --> 01:09:59.310
But isn't there something about the way it's made or something that's

1095
01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:03.210
handcrafted?
It's,
it's uh,
it's,
it's,
I dunno,
I have no fucking idea.

1096
01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:08.040
I drank so little,
I thought it was vodka.
Tequila.
He's got Tito's.

1097
01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.710
Why does he drink Tequila right now?
By the way,

1098
01:10:10.711 --> 01:10:14.340
I cannot help but go to my daughter's school and think about you every time I'm

1099
01:10:14.341 --> 01:10:19.000
there and think about what you were like when you were there.
A monster.
Those,

1100
01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:22.380
that they straighten my shit out though.
Without them,
I would've been a wild dog.

1101
01:10:22.410 --> 01:10:25.860
I'm serious.
I was this close to like running the streets and just being crazy.

1102
01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:28.410
One of the guides,
one of the dads was giving a speech

1103
01:10:28.530 --> 01:10:32.520
<v 0>about,
uh,
like be about the dad's club then.</v>

1104
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:35.790
<v 11>Yeah,
look,
there's a dance club.
And he's like,
you know,
I was there and it was,</v>

1105
01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:39.860
it was so bordering on being inappropriate was cause he was like,
you know,

1106
01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:43.370
I'm here for the dad's club and I just want to let you guys know that,
you know,

1107
01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:46.700
I mean,
this used to be our dream.
Like they're all girls when you were kids,
but,

1108
01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:49.840
and everyone's like,
oh,
you know,

1109
01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:52.370
you don't have to feel creepy when you're coming around and like hanging around

1110
01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.070
as you know what I mean?
Like

1111
01:10:57.020 --> 01:11:01.860
go harder,
go harder.
Talking about the showers.
I did

1112
01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:06.000
<v 0>this a Gig in Madison once where it was at the club,
but they're like,</v>

1113
01:11:06.001 --> 01:11:10.470
it's just going to be girls and their dad's like a sorority girl bought out the

1114
01:11:10.471 --> 01:11:14.700
club and I did this speech.
I was like,
one is ever going to,

1115
01:11:14.701 --> 01:11:17.400
I was doing like a sag and no one's ever going to love you the way your father's

1116
01:11:17.401 --> 01:11:21.870
love you.
And all the dads were like nodding and I was like,
it's a love it.

1117
01:11:21.871 --> 01:11:23.130
You'll never understand.

1118
01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:28.160
So you probably wonder how you could ever reciprocate the love that your dad's

1119
01:11:28.861 --> 01:11:33.200
give you because it's unlike anything else.
And I go and the out,

1120
01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:37.980
really the only thing that would even come close would be if you were to take

1121
01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:41.580
your roommate's panties and put them in a bag and give them to your dad.

1122
01:11:44.410 --> 01:11:46.060
I just stayed on it.
I was like,

1123
01:11:46.061 --> 01:11:49.270
your dad jerks off and he wants to jerk off again.

1124
01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:53.830
He's not jerking off to get your fucking roommates panties,
maybe socks,

1125
01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:56.710
whatever they have.
It smells.
Oh send it to your dad.

1126
01:11:57.010 --> 01:12:01.240
And I just stayed on it and there's like Dad's laughing like really loud and

1127
01:12:01.241 --> 01:12:05.260
then just absolute head shakes.
Yeah,
that is.
But the staff was like,

1128
01:12:05.261 --> 01:12:06.130
that's the best moment

1129
01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:10.960
<v 11>I couldn't,
I couldn't.
Um,
I can't watch porn.</v>

1130
01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:13.380
That even has remotely young.
No,

1131
01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:18.750
because George is 14 so all her friends are like,
they're young ladies.
Yeah.

1132
01:12:18.970 --> 01:12:21.490
And I can't,
I'm like fuck that.

1133
01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:25.570
Like I have to watch old lady like broken.

1134
01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:26.561
<v 0>Interesting.</v>

1135
01:12:26.561 --> 01:12:30.370
And it'll probably the age will keep going up then you can respond to as your

1136
01:12:30.371 --> 01:12:31.300
daughter's age.
Yeah.

1137
01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:34.140
<v 11>Oh I'm sure normal.
Although my father doesn't seem</v>

1138
01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:42.110
why they just married a 34 year olds.

1139
01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:47.390
So gross by the way.
So the,
the school year daughter goes to,

1140
01:12:47.391 --> 01:12:50.240
they did have father daughter dances.
Yeah,
they do every year.

1141
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:52.430
And you have to go on as a costume theme.

1142
01:12:52.431 --> 01:12:55.220
I remember one year and it's super creepy cause you're like,
wait,

1143
01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:58.160
it's couples then.
Oh well I already know my costume.

1144
01:12:58.250 --> 01:12:59.770
What do Dane Cook and his girlfriend.

1145
01:13:05.210 --> 01:13:10.050
Ah,
she's like,
what?
She's 18 years old.
So crazy.

1146
01:13:10.051 --> 01:13:13.530
I mean,
look,
if they're in love,
they're in love.
I'm not shitting on it.
I,
I just,

1147
01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:17.850
I can't imagine typing anything in common with the 18 year old.

1148
01:13:18.510 --> 01:13:22.530
I have a hard time talking to my daughters.
Oh my God.
I can't imagine.

1149
01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:25.190
<v 0>Uh,
do you want to play some clips from the special</v>

1150
01:13:25.250 --> 01:13:29.450
<v 11>oh,
please.
Yeah.
So,
uh,</v>

1151
01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:32.090
he's been waiting a lot.
Can you tell me as many excited to have you Bert?

1152
01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:34.360
He goes,
he goes,
we're going to have so much fun with you when you're here.

1153
01:13:34.361 --> 01:13:36.320
And I was like,
in my head,
I'm in the shower.
I'm like,

1154
01:13:36.321 --> 01:13:37.610
there's going to be a scale.

1155
01:13:39.930 --> 01:13:43.440
<v 0>No.
So a secret time.
It comes out this Friday,</v>

1156
01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:47.970
August 24th.
Yup.
On Netflix worldwide.
Worldwide.

1157
01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:49.920
Um,
here's a clip.

1158
01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.393
<v 10>Are</v>

1159
01:13:56.710 --> 01:14:01.520
All
dog named Dolos

1160
01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:08.230
<v 11>you turned the crowds laughter down.
Oh,
I see.
Yeah.
That's cool.</v>

1161
01:14:08.231 --> 01:14:11.880
I didn't even know you could do that.
Yes.
Sorry.
The fuck was he doing?
He's just,

1162
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:16.710
<v 9>he's a glutton and he does the guy these feeding.
Are you serious?</v>

1163
01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:22.540
Yeah,
he really,
some glyburide be one line animal and you're laughing.

1164
01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:23.770
Hardest Shit.
I don't know what

1165
01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:30.940
he's the best.
Oh,
I'm laughing my ass.
You're laughing.

1166
01:14:30.941 --> 01:14:34.030
And the look on pushes face is so disturbed and it's,

1167
01:14:34.031 --> 01:14:36.040
I think it's about some guy hitting a girl,

1168
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:43.330
but it's only a marriage.

1169
01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:50.880
I've never seen that.
There's,
yes,
there's

1170
01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:55.570
really cool answer.
I remember,
I remember,
and I can't share it,

1171
01:14:55.620 --> 01:15:00.540
<v 11>this story,
I can't share this story because it,
it's,
it's uh,
it is a secret,</v>

1172
01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:03.980
but Tom told me a story one time and it was a,

1173
01:15:04.050 --> 01:15:07.320
about a past relationship you'd have with someone.

1174
01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:12.630
And he told me his story and what excited him and the story was so disturbing to

1175
01:15:12.631 --> 01:15:17.100
me that I went and to this day it's like,

1176
01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:20.160
it's like Leanne doesn't do ass play.
You can't fuck around with her asshole.

1177
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:25.020
And so I'll never be able to change her mind about that.
And so,

1178
01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:26.590
but I remember Tom telling me that now

1179
01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:28.370
<v 9>to this day,
I think about that.</v>

1180
01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:30.220
I think about those of knew what the fuck you would,

1181
01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:32.600
I honestly don't know what you're talking about.
I wish I,
I wish I could share,

1182
01:15:32.601 --> 01:15:34.340
but I would hate to bring it up.
And then you go,
oh,

1183
01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:38.310
I really didn't want it was like two guys talking.
Oh,
okay.
Okay.

1184
01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:40.990
One of those young road trips.
I don't know.
No,

1185
01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:42.440
I don't know the one about bought stuff.

1186
01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:46.190
I really don't know what it is.

1187
01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:52.460
I mean him not wanting to share,
it's not even that bad,
but it,

1188
01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:55.640
but I just don't want to share it.
It's just,
no,

1189
01:15:56.940 --> 01:16:01.250
it's about sex.
It's about sex.
Is it about farming?

1190
01:16:02.730 --> 01:16:07.210
<v 11>No,
it was like,
it was like,
okay,
imagine if someone was like,
um,
measure.</v>

1191
01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:11.130
I can't even say it.
Like measure someone's like,
don't you love Fajitas?

1192
01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:12.600
And then you go,
oh,
I do love Fajitas.

1193
01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:15.630
It's like in your favorite part when you just put your tongue on the,

1194
01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:19.170
on the metal and it Burns your tongue,
you're like,
no,
I don't do that.
And then,

1195
01:16:19.470 --> 01:16:22.110
and then your buddies like that is my favorite part.
And you're like,

1196
01:16:24.750 --> 01:16:28.830
when I was in the car going,
I'm never done that.
And now I'm thinking,

1197
01:16:28.831 --> 01:16:31.950
how come I've never done that?
And the,
how come I'm not into that.
I've seen it,

1198
01:16:31.951 --> 01:16:33.330
but I never done it.
So.

1199
01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:36.830
<v 9>Got You.
Okay.
That's the story.
Expose anybody.</v>

1200
01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:42.600
Exhausting.
Good jokes.
The Casey Anthony,
Joe.

1201
01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:51.640
So,
okay.
I gotta go get some coffee.
Right?

1202
01:16:54.230 --> 01:16:58.190
So where's kit you?
Do they know where Casey?
Anthony.
Yeah,
she's fine.

1203
01:16:58.191 --> 01:17:01.610
She's not guilty.
She's fine.
She's chilling in Florida somewhere.

1204
01:17:01.611 --> 01:17:04.100
I'm sure Casey Anthony is a person that I found out.

1205
01:17:04.101 --> 01:17:07.730
You could get core form online.
You just buy chloroform online.

1206
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.430
A joke.
You didn't get core form.
It just,
it just sent to your house.
Amazon,

1207
01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.730
Amazon.
You can get chloroform.
I'm never fucking room.

1208
01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:19.940
I have a joke about that and even know it's real crazy.
It was so funny.
Yeah,

1209
01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:22.680
definitely.
Okay,
real quick,
just a summary.

1210
01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:30.380
<v 12>Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm mixed.
My weekends.
So much easier.</v>

1211
01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:32.730
<v 0>Then like when they're in trial,
they'll be like,
this guy,</v>

1212
01:17:32.731 --> 01:17:36.270
Bert Kreischer was on a podcast.
You said it.
So all right.

1213
01:17:36.271 --> 01:17:39.100
Tomorrow say Leanne's like,
how are you doing?
You're like,

1214
01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:41.820
what's the fucking questions?
And you divorced her,
right?

1215
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:45.783
<v 12>Okay.</v>

1216
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:47.143
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1217
01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:51.940
<v 12>Yeah.</v>

1218
01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:54.010
<v 0>So you're free.
You're free and clear.</v>

1219
01:17:54.490 --> 01:17:58.480
And then you go to do a Gig and Tampa and you meet this girl at a bar.

1220

01:20:01.890 --> 01:20:05.430
Leann started ruining my orgasms with that stuff.
No,

1251
01:20:06.170 --> 01:20:09.550
I was having the orgasm one time and she was Anthony.

1252
01:20:11.450 --> 01:20:14.190
Uh
Oh.

1253
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:17.650

I was having sex with her.</v>

1256
01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:28.030
I started to have an orgasm if she thought my eyes and she went,
oh,
look at him.

1257
01:20:28.530 --> 01:20:33.430
Fuck.
It went away.
It went away.
And I went,
hey,

1258
01:20:33.431 --> 01:20:37.390
And she's like,

I go,
yeah,
cause I can have an orgasm now.
Yeah.

1259
01:20:37.391 --> 01:20:40.870
And so then the next time we had sex,
he's on top and she was,

1260
01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:44.320
and we were going and she sees it happening in my face and she starts smiling

1261
01:20:44.321 --> 01:20:47.180
like biting her tongue,
like,
and I'm like,
don't fuck it.

1262
01:20:47.230 --> 01:20:50.100
Didn't have it for like a month.
I was,
I wasn't having a mortgage.

1263
01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:53.170
<v 9>Well,

I'm trying to work on that at Casey.</v>

1264
01:20:53.171 --> 01:20:56.880
Anthony.
Yeah,
I think there's something to it,
right?
Yeah.
No.

1265
01:20:57.250 --> 01:21:02.110
So let's say Leanne dies tomorrow.
Oh,
here we go.
I like this scenario.

1266
01:21:03.050 --> 01:21:06.820
All right,
let's start off with,
I get $2 million life insurance.
Hey,

1267
01:21:06.821 --> 01:21:11.700

That's good.
2 million.
1 million.
Anyways,
so yeah.
Hey,

1268
01:21:11.710 --> 01:21:15.040

Tom and I like talk about this all the time.
Who's a secretary?

1269
01:21:15.041 --> 01:21:18.190
A boat by boat first.
What was the second?
What was the question?

1270
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:20.990
What's the second wife leg spouse.

1271

I'm saying Tom's going to go for like the Dalmatian.

1272
01:21:23.710 --> 01:21:27.790
She thinks I'm going to get a real,
a real dumb dumb like 25 years old.

1273
01:21:27.791 --> 01:21:32.530
Yoga instructor never pushes back.
Never challenged him.
Total dope.

1274
01:21:33.010 --> 01:21:37.590
Just like,

Like a total down,

Catch it.
And then she goes so funny.
Yeah.

1276
01:21:41.790 --> 01:21:44.650
And she goes to all your shows and watches every single one of them.

1277
01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:47.380
Great job babies.
So good.
And you want to get like heckled.
She's like,

1278

He could make,

1279
01:21:51.011 --> 01:21:54.760

I love him.
This is what I mean.

1280
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.270
I am laughing all day long.
Yeah.
That,
that girl

1281
01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:02.550
<v 11>I'd probably go with.
I'd probably go with someone like that.</v>

1282
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:06.960
I definitely would like to do some stuff that I haven't been able to do like

1283
01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:11.800
talking about you live a single person's life.
Yeah.
No,

I met sexually.

1284
01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:15.700
I liked like,
oh yeah,
we're going rough and rowdy.
Like yeah,

1285
01:22:15.810 --> 01:22:18.060
I'm not going to like Liam are very meat potatoes.

1286
01:22:18.061 --> 01:22:22.140
We haven't really like switch things up like done anything crazy at a very long

1287
01:22:22.141 --> 01:22:25.880
time.
You mean like fuck swings or like,
I dunno,

1288
01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:30.210
just everything.
I mean group sex,
things like that.
No,
are just young.

1289
01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:33.300
I want young.
Yeah.
Oh go.
I would go probably,

1290
01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:36.360
I'd probably go like 30 years old.
I know that's not young,

1291
01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:41.300
but 30 for me is really young.
Yeah.
30 years old.
You're 46.
Oh No,

1292
01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:44.610
no,
no,
no.
Yeah,
no,
no.
I go 30 years old and I start,
I start having kids again too.

1293
01:22:44.770 --> 01:22:48.730
<v 9>Oh really?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
Yup,
Yup.
I did.
I definitely go to more kids.</v>

1294
01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:50.890
Like a lion.
You got up,

1295
01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:55.760
you get out of it almost makes me excited now.
Like,
yeah,
definitely.

1296
01:22:55.761 --> 01:22:58.570
We have more kids.
And would you tell your daughters now?
I'd be like,

1297
01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:02.810
I wouldn't a sorry,
but like,
they're babies.
I know,
but you gotta be,

1298
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:06.190
<v 11>first of all,
if they're not in college,
will be in boarding school lands on here.</v>

1299
01:23:06.191 --> 01:23:09.370
I'm not living with them all going to either out of their minds

1300
01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:12.880
<v 3>and,
okay.
But I see,
I see him kind of with a party girl,
like,
uh,</v>

1301
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:18.130
like a bleachy blonde party girl hero who w Arizona State.
Yeah,

1302
01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:22.540
graduate.
Right.
She's got to have a bad attitude though.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh,

1303
01:23:22.541 --> 01:23:26.170
she's got tattoos on her ankle.
Tats a dolphin somewhere.

1304
01:23:26.171 --> 01:23:30.100
Always disapproving of him,
you know,
like having fun with them but being like,

1305
01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:33.400
just kind of snap,
kind of shitting on a moment.
Yeah.

1306
01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:34.730
<v 11>Yeah.
I definitely need that.</v>

1307
01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:40.130
I often think if Leanne died,
no one,

1308
01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:44.330
like if she died before me,
everyone will be like,
everyone would be like,

1309
01:23:44.331 --> 01:23:46.480
you should have been,
you know,
everyone,

1310
01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:49.880
like at her funeral they'd be looking at me like the wrong one died.

1311
01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:56.960
I ask Leanne one time if,
how,
uh,
how upset she be.
Like if I died,

1312
01:23:57.380 --> 01:24:00.140
she goes,
I gotta be honest with you.
I think I might be a tablet that relieved.

1313
01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:05.030
And I went,
really?
And she goes,
I mean,
I worry about you a lot and I feel like,

1314
01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:07.790
I feel like I take care of you so much that if you died I'd be like,

1315
01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:12.230
finally I can focus on me.
Wow.

1316
01:24:12.290 --> 01:24:16.660
That seems really real.
Very real.
Kind of tell us where a therapist,
right?
Yeah.

1317
01:24:16.710 --> 01:24:21.200
She's,
yeah.
Yeah,
sure.
Her a damn.
Yeah.
I don't know.

1318
01:24:21.201 --> 01:24:24.440
I definitely would go be Deb did on her,
her therapy sessions.
She was like,
Oh,

1319
01:24:24.441 --> 01:24:28.820
first,
first I go through and fuck all her friends.
Yeah,
you would clean up.

1320
01:24:28.821 --> 01:24:32.090
I clean up all of friends.
She's like,
mom,
dad,
just go through a tear.

1321
01:24:32.091 --> 01:24:34.220
Those up once ruined everyone's marriage.

1322
01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:39.770
I remember one time I told him which of her friends,
I thought I could fuck,

1323
01:24:39.771 --> 01:24:42.320
this is a long time ago.
Yeah.
And she was,
this was like,

1324
01:24:43.130 --> 01:24:45.350
we're not even friends with those people.
And I was like,

1325
01:24:45.351 --> 01:24:48.140
I definitely could fuck her.
And Leanne's like,
no,
you cut in tonight.
Oh No,

1326
01:24:48.141 --> 01:24:50.960
I definitely,
I know who I can talk and I know I can't fuck.
Okay.

1327
01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:54.150
And then Leanne brought it up to them at dinner.
I was like,
God,

1328
01:24:54.310 --> 01:24:59.240
now I definitely can't her.
She was like,
I would never have sex with you.

1329
01:24:59.270 --> 01:25:02.460
And I was like,
I think you're wrong about that.
And her husband's there.
Yeah.

1330
01:25:02.610 --> 01:25:03.443
He's like,

1331
01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:06.320
she would tell me I'm about it was better looking than her husband at the time.

1332
01:25:06.410 --> 01:25:10.510
I still am by the way,
don't even married anymore.
Oh,
so,
oh,
so she,
you could,

1333
01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:12.260
I think I still could check this out.
Wow.

1334
01:25:13.370 --> 01:25:14.660
<v 13>I'm trying to get fatter.</v>

1335
01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:22.160
I want to be like my hero.
His name is Burt Christ.
Jesus Christ,

1336
01:25:22.610 --> 01:25:26.580
the American comedian.
He's so fucking fat.

1337
01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:30.710
So lock in.
So in the last eight months,

1338
01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:33.553
<v 7>I'll put on</v>

1339
01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:39.680
<v 13>starting on a half because I want to be fat like him.</v>

1340
01:25:42.530 --> 01:25:43.363
I don't know.

1341
01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:44.300
<v 3>They just send it in.</v>

1342
01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:47.420
<v 11>That's fucking insane.</v>

1343

1344
01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:55.260
the actual promo here of the show.

1345
01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:56.460
who do I get to remarry?

1346
01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:01.610
<v 11>I probably wouldn't get married.
Did you do it?
Yeah,
I bet I can.
I can.
You don't.</v>

1347
01:26:01.630 --> 01:26:04.310
You'd move to Ohio and you start writing

1348
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:08.030
<v 9>books.
I don't know if Tom died.</v>

1349
01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:11.390
You and the boys would move somewhere nice.
I think you'd leave La.

1350
01:26:11.391 --> 01:26:14.180
You'd move somewhere Nice Santa Barbara.
Yeah.
And then you,

1351
01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:16.520
and you probably would not get on stage again.

1352
01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:21.620
I think she would hook up with like gardener,
the gardener,

1353
01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:25.830
the gardener,
maybe that team of gardeners coast-wide wide,

1354
01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:31.190
like,
yeah.
He's like,
Hey,

1355
01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:36.080
I have no seen him.
And then she'd be like,
he died.
And they'd be like,

1356
01:26:36.081 --> 01:26:39.380
this is nice.
You did right.
The chicks and you're like,
yeah,

1357
01:26:39.381 --> 01:26:41.520
I'll still write the checks.
And they like me and uh,

1358
01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:45.860
I'll say that I wouldn't want to give you some out that

1359
01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:48.450
you saw in your mouth.

1360
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:53.263
<v 12>Okay.</v>

1361
01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:56.650
<v 9>But then you'd be like,
no,
but you leave the door open and they'd be like,</v>

1362
01:26:57.410 --> 01:27:00.130
Bang on.
And all the gardeners would run a train on me.

1363
01:27:00.131 --> 01:27:02.500
Is that what you're saying you took to,
that you jumped,

1364
01:27:03.250 --> 01:27:06.190
you suggested that you use the language,
they would run a train on

1365
01:27:08.650 --> 01:27:10.900
Bam.
You don't think it would tell me like that what happened?

1366
01:27:13.450 --> 01:27:16.450
I think it's more likely for Leanne to be with another woman than to be with

1367
01:27:16.451 --> 01:27:18.680
another man really young.

1368
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:25.840
When I first met her,
because she's kind of like,
I dunno,

1369
01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:30.370
I don't think she,
I don't see her.
I do not see her longing for another man.

1370
01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:32.740
Like that just is not in a book.

1371
01:27:35.190 --> 01:27:39.070
See if you like this.
Ready?
Hold on.
Let me get this set up here.

1372
01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:42.520
This is,
this looks like it's blue's clues.

1373
01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:43.533
<v 12>Okay.
Hold on.</v>

1374
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:49.610
<v 9>What the fuck</v>

1375
01:27:55.290 --> 01:27:56.190
<v 12>you made this?</v>

1376
01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:06.130
Eh,

1377
01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:15.733
oh my God.

1378
01:28:21.770 --> 01:28:25.750
Pass out.
Oh my God.
Who

1379
01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:29.170
<v 9>did that?
I commissioned it to be done.
You are not.
You did not swear to God.</v>

1380
01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:33.430
Are you fucking serious?
That is amazing.
They even got my gold teeth in there.

1381
01:28:33.450 --> 01:28:35.210
Yeah.
They put my gold teeth in there.

1382
01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:39.890
They have this made up bald spot in the back of your head.
Yeah,

1383
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:42.850
I know what that is.
Bizarre that they'd put that in there.

1384
01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:47.410
That's Tony Solano and Eric Friedman.
I want to say it.
Make sure I say it right.

1385
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:50.740
Are you serious?
That is fucking amazing.
So excited about this by the way.

1386
01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:54.220
I've been watching.
Did you post that online yet?
No,
not yet.
Oh my God.

1387
01:28:54.221 --> 01:28:56.620
That's fucking amazing.
Yeah.
I'm

1388
01:28:58.180 --> 01:29:00.640
sure that influences all the stuff for you to come in.

1389
01:29:00.670 --> 01:29:03.630
He doesn't this for anybody,
just so you know.
Oh my God.
Come on.

1390
01:29:04.030 --> 01:29:06.660
I also did with you.
That's so excited to pick a musical.

1391
01:29:06.661 --> 01:29:11.040
There was so many good ones I picked.
I'm sorry.
I had to pick a musical bed.

1392
01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:15.630
Four.
Where's this one?
The class.
Are they proud of you?
I am proud of them.

1393
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:20.580
Here's the a classic one.
The classical music one,
let's see.

1394
01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:24.620
It's the same thing,
but with,
couldn't figure out what music to put in it.

1395
01:29:26.130 --> 01:29:27.000
I like this one.

1396
01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:31.853
<v 12>Yeah,</v>

1397
01:29:37.370 --> 01:29:40.770
<v 9>he did a great job.
This is awesome.
Well,
we'll post it everywhere.</v>

1398
01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:48.160
<v 12>I
bet</v>

1399
01:30:00.190 --> 01:30:04.240
<v 9>we're about to pass out.
That is fucking awesome.
If you're just listening,</v>

1400
01:30:04.241 --> 01:30:07.570
we'll post it everywhere.
We'll put it on Instagram.
We'll put it on youtube.

1401
01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:10.990
I'll give it to you to post if you want.
Please.
Did you see,

1402
01:30:10.991 --> 01:30:12.460
did you see my billboard by any chance?

1403
01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:17.650
Is it the image that I haven't seen the billboard.
Just my belly.
So it's the,

1404
01:30:17.651 --> 01:30:21.160
it's the art.
The,
yeah,
that's great.
It's fun.

1405
01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:25.300
It's Netflix sent it to me and they were like,
I hope you like this.

1406
01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:28.190
We really like it.
We're not making fun of you.
We just think it's going to,

1407
01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:30.700
it's real really stand out.

1408
01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:33.910
And I didn't see the right one at first and I was like,
ah,
I don't like it.

1409
01:30:33.940 --> 01:30:37.030
It was something else.
And they're like,
all right,
we've drawn up alternatives.

1410
01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:40.090
But once again,
we'd,
we'd,
we'd ask you to reconsider this.

1411
01:30:40.270 --> 01:30:44.200
And I know that they were thinking that they thought with all the fat shaming

1412
01:30:44.201 --> 01:30:46.960
stuff was like,
as soon as I saw it I went,
oh my God,
it's fucking awesome.

1413
01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:49.780
And then they were like,
oh,
thank God.
I like when you posted your like,

1414
01:30:49.781 --> 01:30:53.170
this is so us.
Cause it's his next to mine.

1415
01:30:53.410 --> 01:30:57.250
So it's like me and like jacket black.
You see it?
Yeah,
I think so.
Well let me,

1416
01:30:57.251 --> 01:31:00.430

Pull it,

1417
01:31:00.431 --> 01:31:03.520

I,
I'm so excited.

1418
01:31:03.521 --> 01:31:05.530
And where is it?
Where's your billboard?
Melrose.

1419
01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:07.780
And there's one on Melrose and one on Coalinga.

1420
01:31:07.810 --> 01:31:12.760
That's the one I got the one on Melrose.
Yeah.
Dude.
That's awesome.
Yeah,
I'm super,

1421
01:31:12.761 --> 01:31:16.150

I mean it's not my face,
but yeah.
Yeah.

1422
01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:18.100
Oh that's great.

1423
01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:26.070
That's great.
Yeah,

Uh,

Oh,

1424
01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:30.370
I love that.
Fucking that cartoon.
So that was good.
That's really great.

1425
01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:36.100
Um,
does,
uh,
your dad,
has your dad hit well,
he hasn't seen the screen.

1426
01:31:36.130 --> 01:31:39.150
No,
he won't.
He won't watch it.
You don't watch it.
You sure know?
You get,

1427
01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:41.050
your sisters are going to watch it.
My sisters are going to watch it.

1428
01:31:41.051 --> 01:31:44.970
My Dad won't watch it.
My Dad,
it might make my dad nervous.
Why would I,
you know,

1429
01:31:44.971 --> 01:31:46.420
it's funny,
I love,
I was gonna tell you this.

1430
01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:51.520
I love when you remember a story in real life with one of your friends or

1431
01:31:51.521 --> 01:31:53.560
somebody told and then you see it in a bit.

1432
01:31:53.770 --> 01:31:58.270
I remember at Banana Republic story like 10 years ago.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1433
01:31:58.330 --> 01:32:02.620
So like it's to see this story like that you,
I heard in a car,

1434
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:03.980
you know what I mean?
Like on our,

1435
01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:06.760
on our way to a bit that he worked out like it wasn't even,

1436
01:32:06.761 --> 01:32:09.160
it was just like a story.
He was like,
Oh yeah,
it was,
you know,
my dad,

1437
01:32:09.161 --> 01:32:11.950
blah blah blah.
I told the story in the car and then you fast forward,
he's like,

1438
01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:13.060
oh,
that's on.
That's an a bit,

1439
01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:15.480
<v 11>most of them.
Most of what I'm doing,</v>

1440
01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:19.470
and I'm not even joking I think are things I would tell you when we were driving

1441
01:32:19.471 --> 01:32:22.540
out to a brayer and we just pull shit.

1442
01:32:22.630 --> 01:32:26.450
There's a bit that I had you laughing so hard at when we were driving a brave

1443
01:32:26.451 --> 01:32:31.451
one time and I thought this could be a joke and I cannot remember how to do it.

1444
01:32:31.950 --> 01:32:33.210
It was about growing up in a,

1445
01:32:33.211 --> 01:32:36.270
in a white trash neighborhood and it was something about,

1446
01:32:36.271 --> 01:32:37.140
there were these two brothers,

1447
01:32:37.141 --> 01:32:41.670
Darren and Darren or Darryl and Darren and I was in first grade and I walked up

1448
01:32:41.671 --> 01:32:44.700
and he was fingering a girl in his front yard and I was just standing there.

1449
01:32:44.701 --> 01:32:47.250
I know it was,
I was in,
I was in first grade and he was,

1450
01:32:47.251 --> 01:32:50.040
but he was older and he was fingering her and I was standing there trying to

1451
01:32:50.041 --> 01:32:51.600
talk to him.
I don't remember the story,

1452
01:32:51.601 --> 01:32:54.210
but you were laughing so hard and I was like,
I remember going,

1453
01:32:54.211 --> 01:32:56.580
I got to work this out.
And I was like,
don't work it out tonight.

1454
01:32:56.581 --> 01:32:59.950
Because then he'll know that you got it from this moment or he'll feel like you

1455
01:32:59.951 --> 01:33:02.700
were running bits on him working out later and they never worked it out.

1456
01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:03.733
It's a little bit of that bit,

1457
01:33:03.770 --> 01:33:08.310
<v 9>Oh,
what a neat story.
Then it's already making me laugh.</v>

1458
01:33:08.630 --> 01:33:11.640
You you bring it back or anything I liked the best part is that you're standing

1459
01:33:11.641 --> 01:33:12.474
there like

1460
01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:15.640
<v 11>so like are we going to play smear the queer later?
And he was like,</v>

1461
01:33:15.730 --> 01:33:17.920
I'm in the middle of something.
And then I was like,
okay.

1462
01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:20.530
He was on his front lawn fingering who's under a tree,

1463
01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:23.140
just fingering this girl and I was so oblivious.

1464
01:33:23.141 --> 01:33:26.480
I walked up and I was first grade and those are my speedo.
Swimming.
Yeah.

1465
01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:30.160
I was like,
so are we play in smooth Greer later and he was like,
excuse me.

1466
01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:32.130
I was like,
are we supposed to be the,
we're new

1467
01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:35.990
<v 10>like you wouldn't out of control drunk.
That guy</v>

1468
01:33:37.610 --> 01:33:40.980
want to see one
bird.

1469
01:33:41.770 --> 01:33:46.700
Gracious do special secret tide is on Netflix right now.

1470
01:33:46.930 --> 01:33:51.420
Right now.
Right now.
Wait,
who did these Jake,
he's a voiceover artist.

1471
01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:53.413
Really?

1472
01:33:53.900 --> 01:33:55.770
<v 9>Is it a professional real deal?</v>

1473
01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:01.410
And he's a real,
I mean,
yeah.
No,
this wasn't free.

1474
01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:06.960
<v 11>Not if it was so nervous getting rid of so much fun with you.
I was like,</v>

1475
01:34:07.170 --> 01:34:08.810
Oh fuck donuts are going to be there.

1476
01:34:09.290 --> 01:34:13.560
<v 9>I head up so much like what happened to our doughnut eating contest.</v>

1477
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:15.060
I remember when I called you and you're like,

1478
01:34:15.061 --> 01:34:18.540
I could definitely fucking smash like it was right before the marathon and by

1479
01:34:18.541 --> 01:34:22.170
the way,
okay,
so you did so far in the last year he did a marathon,

1480
01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:27.570
a half of your half marathon,
marathon.
He just did a mini the triathlon.

1481
01:34:28.110 --> 01:34:31.380
What's going on with you?
What's all this crisis?
Yeah,
I think so.

1482
01:34:31.381 --> 01:34:35.220
I think I actually 46 45 you're turning 46

1483
01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:38.750
<v 11>in November.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I the,</v>

1484
01:34:38.910 --> 01:34:42.020
the marathon was the biggest mistake of my life.
If I could go back,

1485
01:34:42.021 --> 01:34:43.510
I would never run that marathon.
Why?

1486
01:34:43.511 --> 01:34:46.460
Why would you call it the biggest mistake of your life?
Because I went from,

1487
01:34:46.490 --> 01:34:50.120
we were all over around two 25 at the time.
All of us.

1488
01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:52.520
We had kept off the weight for so long and then when I ran the marathon,

1489
01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:56.030
I couldn't walk for a week and I couldn't work out for like over a month and I

1490
01:34:56.031 --> 01:34:59.660
put on 15 pounds immediately.
He's Zeus Ho ran the marathon with me too.

1491
01:34:59.930 --> 01:35:02.520
And he was like,
dude,
I gained so much weight after that marathon.
Wow.

1492
01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:06.580
Because both of us,
I was,
my body was unusable.
So you're just like,
I'm,

1493
01:35:06.650 --> 01:35:07.670
I can't move.
I,

1494
01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:12.590
I cannot express to you how little I could walk after the marathon for o week.

1495
01:35:12.770 --> 01:35:17.540
I couldn't get out of bed and move and like still my scapula somethings.
I mean,

1496
01:35:17.541 --> 01:35:21.290
it's just,
it's just an unneeded pressure on your body.
But,
uh,

1497
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:23.750
it didn't stop you from doing all these other wacky thing.
Well,

1498
01:35:23.751 --> 01:35:27.920
I got did the triathlon because men's health hit me up and was like,
man,

1499
01:35:27.921 --> 01:35:30.350
we're so inspired by all these things you're doing.

1500
01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:35.000
You're making the average guy these accessible for the average guy and what's

1501
01:35:35.001 --> 01:35:39.830
next?
And I was like,
I,
I've always wanted to do a triathlon.
I've always wanted,

1502
01:35:39.831 --> 01:35:41.510
man,
I try.
I was on was scariest fucking shit.

1503
01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:46.310
I would die so that people understand what you're talking about.
There's,
there's,

1504
01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:50.570
there are full,
there are half,
there are like sprint one sprint.

1505
01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:55.700
But just so people understand you swam 400 meters water meters,

1506
01:35:55.730 --> 01:35:59.900
which is I think everyone,
I remember telling him to rnr,
he's like [inaudible].

1507
01:35:59.930 --> 01:36:03.200
He's like,
oh,
so it's doable.
But I,
that's what I thought.
Very doable.

1508
01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:06.110
Until you actually get in the water and swim and you're like,
okay,

1509
01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:11.250
quarter of a mile is a long swim and it's,
it takes me,
it takes me in the pool,

1510
01:36:11.251 --> 01:36:15.500
it takes me eight minutes to do and I am gassed at the end of 400 meters.

1511
01:36:15.540 --> 01:36:19.160
He supposed to go straight from that to a 10 mile bike ride to a 10 mile bike

1512
01:36:19.161 --> 01:36:22.010
ride and then a three and then a three mile run.

1513
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:24.980
And so I did the swim.
Dude,

1514
01:36:26.450 --> 01:36:29.720
here's the biggest problem with me is I am truly competitive.

1515
01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:32.630
Like there is this part of my brain where it's like,

1516
01:36:32.930 --> 01:36:34.910
where I was like getting out there,
I was like,
I'm not coming to last.

1517
01:36:34.911 --> 01:36:36.380
I'm not gonna allow myself to come in last.

1518
01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:41.630
And so I get off of the swim and I get out first hundred meters and like halfway

1519
01:36:41.631 --> 01:36:44.420
in I look out and I'm like number four and I'm like,

1520
01:36:44.421 --> 01:36:48.140
I'm fucking leaving this triathlon.
And I'm like,
Holy Shit.
And I'm looking,

1521
01:36:48.170 --> 01:36:52.760
I'm like pay checking and everyone's going in the total wrong fucking direction.

1522
01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:56.240
Like they're all swimming wide.
And I'm like,
I'm like,
I'm going to fucking,

1523
01:36:56.750 --> 01:36:59.780
I'm going to lead this.
And then I start going,
I know I can do this swim,

1524
01:36:59.781 --> 01:37:01.370
I'm going to fucking lead this triathlon.

1525
01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:05.270
I get to the buoy and I cut real tight on the buoy and I do this move.

1526
01:37:05.271 --> 01:37:08.720
I'd only seen on a online,
I'd never tried it before,

1527
01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:12.680
but it's like a swim where you like kind of flip over your body and swim and so

1528
01:37:12.681 --> 01:37:17.210
you take your thing and then you flip on your back.
And so it's a way to turn.

1529
01:37:17.810 --> 01:37:21.380
As soon as I did it,
this Chinese guy jumped on my stomach,

1530
01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:25.790
sunk me underwater and dove over me.
I sucked him water,

1531
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.380
breathed in,
water came up,

1532
01:37:27.710 --> 01:37:31.040
and I go to take another breath and another guy grabs on my back and pushes over

1533
01:37:31.041 --> 01:37:34.220
me because they're just getting you out of the way.
They're fucking,
it's a race.

1534
01:37:34.250 --> 01:37:37.790
They're fucking racing and I'm in the way and they're climbing over me and

1535
01:37:37.791 --> 01:37:41.330
they're punching like,
and I start getting drowned.
I'm literally drowning.

1536
01:37:41.331 --> 01:37:43.250
I'm in like probably a hundred feet of water.

1537
01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:48.560
I'm a hundred yards out and I slept 300 yards to swim back in and I almost waved

1538
01:37:50.091 --> 01:37:52.430
over one of the guys on the surfboard,
like I think I'm dying.

1539
01:37:52.850 --> 01:37:55.980
And then I just got on my back and like start a breeding and were still all my

1540
01:37:55.981 --> 01:37:59.030
back.
People were climbing,
let me tried to swim out wide and that's,
and I,

1541
01:37:59.070 --> 01:38:02.400
and then that's why they were swimming wide because everyone was swimming out.

1542
01:38:02.401 --> 01:38:04.830
Why?
Because they were like,
I don't want to get beat up like a fucking idiot.

1543
01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:10.280
And so I had just got trampled by like 40 people just swimming over me by far.

1544
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:14.860
Is this one of the hardest part?
Easily?
The hardest part actually no questions.

1545
01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:18.030
I like bike is the easiest bike is a cake,
not a cake walk,
but like,

1546
01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:19.950
like an idiot.
Once again,
I get on the bike and I got a,

1547
01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:22.480
I bought a really expensive like,
yeah,
of course.
Yeah,

1548
01:38:22.530 --> 01:38:25.290
of course you've got the best,
like the best,
the best.

1549
01:38:25.291 --> 01:38:28.950
The guy and I Martin the guy,
this is a big fan of all of ours and he goes,

1550
01:38:29.070 --> 01:38:32.570
he's like,
he's like a British guy and he's like,
you know,
we can,
uh,

1551
01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:37.500
if we can do like microcarbon or whatever and look,
take a pound off this.

1552
01:38:37.501 --> 01:38:39.670
And I go,
yeah,
yeah,
let's shave as much weight off the bike because we can,

1553
01:38:39.930 --> 01:38:40.681
and they looked at me,
it was,

1554
01:38:40.681 --> 01:38:43.940
or you could ride the bike a little bit and lose like 10 pounds and I'll leave

1555
01:38:43.941 --> 01:38:48.150
and be lighter.
It's like,
oh yeah,
that's right.
But I get on the bike.

1556
01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:53.490
Tell me real quick,
where you the biggest guy there by far
Tom.

1557
01:38:53.690 --> 01:38:57.600
I get it.
Everybody was just like leaving.
It must have been super in shape.

1558
01:38:57.601 --> 01:39:00.510
And then,
yeah,
I get up there and I was like,
yeah,

1559
01:39:00.511 --> 01:39:02.940
I'm here for register for the triathlon.
And they're like,
oh,

1560
01:39:02.941 --> 01:39:07.140
are you in are clydesdale division?
I went,
excuse me,
it's for fat people.

1561
01:39:07.141 --> 01:39:10.260
They call them Clydesdales.
I go,
no wait,

1562
01:39:10.261 --> 01:39:12.720
I could have been in the Clydesdales and they're like,
wait,

1563
01:39:12.721 --> 01:39:16.200
you're just running the regular triathlon?
I was like,
yeah.
And they're like,
oh,

1564
01:39:16.201 --> 01:39:19.470
you should have registered for the Clydesdales.
And I was like,
no.

1565
01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:24.300
And so I was by far the fattest person there.

1566
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:29.390
There's without a doubt in my fucking swimsuit did not fit right.

1567
01:39:33.790 --> 01:39:37.260
I love it.
It's like all these other dudes,

1568
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:41.520
they don't even make double XL triathlon suits because no one does it.

1569
01:39:41.850 --> 01:39:44.010
It mean they do.
You have to get them a special ordered though.

1570
01:39:44.011 --> 01:39:47.510
Fucking hilarious fit people.
This is this is it starting right here?
Yeah.

1571
01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:49.433
<v 1>Fuck.</v>

1572
01:39:50.540 --> 01:39:53.690
<v 11>Are you trained for this?
Thank you.
Yeah,
I train hard.
I thought you did.</v>

1573
01:39:53.691 --> 01:39:57.290
And I was like,
he's gonna die.
And so I keep swimming right.
And when I get,

1574
01:39:57.291 --> 01:39:59.720
by the time I get to settle,
do we see all these people going wide?
Yeah.
I'm like,

1575
01:39:59.721 --> 01:40:00.800
where the fuck are they going?

1576
01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:03.680
<v 1>Oh my God.
Hmm.</v>

1577
01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:08.030
<v 11>The bike.
I get on the bike and I start blowing past people.
Yeah.</v>

1578
01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:12.190
Blow impasse really good in that suit.
Oh yeah.
I was like,
Hey Leanne,

1579
01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:15.860
you could have taken one picture where I don't look fat as fuck cause she was

1580
01:40:15.861 --> 01:40:17.840
like,
I was really hard to kind of get one of those.

1581
01:40:18.590 --> 01:40:21.440
I got on the bike and start blowing past everybody and then we get to this

1582
01:40:21.441 --> 01:40:25.580
uphill and the uphills by this prison and everyone I passed just fucking flies

1583
01:40:25.581 --> 01:40:26.360
past me.

1584
01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:29.420
Then we get to this downhill at the top of the prison and I started going on my

1585
01:40:29.421 --> 01:40:30.890
watch.
It tells you how fast you're going.

1586
01:40:31.010 --> 01:40:34.160
I'm going like fucking 35 miles per hour.
I'm hauling ass with my bike.

1587
01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:38.450
Full lying pass.
People going.
Why are they going so slow?
There's a cop going,

1588
01:40:38.690 --> 01:40:41.000
sharp turn,
sharp turn.

1589
01:40:41.001 --> 01:40:44.000
I'm like skid around the door.

1590
01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:46.820
I mean I really was unprepared for this fucking thing.

1591
01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:49.040
How hard is it to run after all that?

1592
01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:53.980
The running the first mile is almost,
you feel like your body,
you remember when

1593
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:56.890
<v 9>we'd go to Barry's bootcamp and you get off and you do chest and then you get on</v>

1594
01:40:56.891 --> 01:40:59.260
the thing,
they're like,
my body's not working.
Yeah.
It was like that.

1595
01:40:59.670 --> 01:41:01.930
Cause you did swim bike,
you just swim,
bike,

1596
01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:04.840
and then you what you were kind of re recuperate after on the second mile,

1597
01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:06.130
on the second mile,

1598
01:41:06.131 --> 01:41:08.710
you start feeling good and then at the end of the second mile you're like,
oh,

1599
01:41:08.711 --> 01:41:12.130
I'm almost done.
I'm almost done with the whole fucking day.
And then I,
and yeah,

1600
01:41:12.131 --> 01:41:15.150
but then I got to this and it's Holly Shit out there and we ran through all

1601
01:41:15.170 --> 01:41:16.570
these Mexican families grilling out.

1602
01:41:16.571 --> 01:41:19.870
We ran through a park that's always Mexican families are like staring at us like

1603
01:41:19.871 --> 01:41:22.780
all these white people jogging and ridiculous outfits.

1604
01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:27.570
And what did you eat after completing this?
I didn't eat poorly.
I went home.
Yeah,

1605
01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:31.830
I ate good because I learned my eye.
I got a nutritionist from the mayor.

1606
01:41:31.870 --> 01:41:35.110
From men's health.
Yeah,
this girl's Cynthia.
She's awesome.

1607
01:41:35.530 --> 01:41:38.710
And she got me on a pretty strict diet.
I wasn't boozing.
I didn't,

1608
01:41:38.711 --> 01:41:42.400
I haven't drank for like a month almost.
I'd like this weekend though.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1609
01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:46.470
I'm not going to Columbus.
I'm not going to have a few fucking cocktails.
Yeah.

1610
01:41:46.850 --> 01:41:50.530
Columbus is a good cocktail.
Oh,
it's like the ass,
right?

1611
01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:53.420
Yeah.
This is a real clip from his special,
yeah.

1612
01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:57.670
<v 5>Lower your expectations.
Really.</v>

1613
01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:00.300
<v 14>We're just getting drunk and telling secrets.</v>

1614
01:42:02.530 --> 01:42:04.720
Secret top secret time.

1615
01:42:06.430 --> 01:42:10.230
Secret time when they get out of the shower.
I dry my asshole on the bed.
Bam.

1616
01:42:13.670 --> 01:42:17.180
We ain't got so pissed sometimes when I wipe my ass,
I spit on the toilet paper.

1617
01:42:17.210 --> 01:42:18.530
It's called Alabama wet wipe.

1618
01:42:25.230 --> 01:42:28.590
Beard looks darker than my wife has an orgasm.
She looks like Elvis.

1619
01:42:28.650 --> 01:42:32.010
Her country.
She loves Allen.
Yeah.

1620
01:42:32.650 --> 01:42:33.950
<v 9>So you're pissed about that one.
No,</v>

1621
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:37.930
she got pissed about the wipe him drawing my bet on the ass.
Fold the bed.

1622
01:42:38.290 --> 01:42:42.010
Can you probably do.
I definitely do.
I get on the shower and I just go and I,

1623
01:42:42.530 --> 01:42:45.520
I put a little like pinch a little volcano out of the comforter.

1624
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:48.640
I just sit on it and dry my asshole about his house.

1625
01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:53.800
I'm a nasty,
nasty,
really nasty.

1626
01:42:53.980 --> 01:42:57.280
Let me ask you this because I've got a few hemorrhoids from the second
pregnancy.

1627
01:42:57.390 --> 01:42:59.530
Oh,
Tom's like basketball,
right about this.

1628
01:42:59.531 --> 01:43:03.750
Cause he's probably an expert on Hamline had been down for Emma.

1629
01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:08.310
Throw up trying to be nasty.
He kept me nasty too.

1630
01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:10.540
But so tell me about how do I get rid of them?

1631
01:43:10.541 --> 01:43:11.950
Do I have to have surgery or is there a,

1632
01:43:11.951 --> 01:43:14.980
is there any other way to get rid of these things?
Oh,
I've had them come and go.

1633
01:43:15.310 --> 01:43:17.320
That's what I was talking about.
Why do they come and go?

1634
01:43:17.350 --> 01:43:20.290
What makes them coming up your way or your,
I don't know.

1635
01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:23.680
I had one in Singapore when I was doing the Australian tour.

1636
01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:28.150
I've got one in Singapore and I thought I had asked cancer.
It hurts so bad.

1637
01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:31.570
When does it hurt you when you're just sitting down or when your mom was
hurting?

1638
01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:33.840
All the time.
But they can come and then it's like,

1639
01:43:33.940 --> 01:43:38.020
so you pushed really hard to make a baby,
make a baby coming into in flames.

1640
01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:42.120
The veins down there and that's,
I had some during my pregnancy and I think it,

1641
01:43:42.140 --> 01:43:44.940
cause I was so hard.
He had a bad sister,

1642
01:43:44.941 --> 01:43:48.420
had a really bad kind of cluster of them.
She'll love to hear this part.
Yeah,

1643
01:43:48.490 --> 01:43:53.330
she will lose her shit.
But it only hurts wipe cut or no,

1644
01:43:53.331 --> 01:43:55.400
I think they just go away up the,
I think if you just,

1645
01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:58.420
you get to get a suppository.
What do you ever have?

1646
01:43:58.430 --> 01:44:00.710
You're never put his paws story I've done at once and it like,

1647
01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:03.590
I got it halfway in and then I immediately started shitting and I was like,
oh.

1648
01:44:03.591 --> 01:44:06.260
And I just,
I pooped it out right away.
I used to have a joke about,

1649
01:44:06.510 --> 01:44:10.070
but now only you have to,
it's very specific.
This is my impression of,

1650
01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:13.940
of Sabaas a Tori.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I'll take it from here.

1651
01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:17.780
Wait,
I'm curious now,

1652
01:44:17.810 --> 01:44:21.380
what's the part that I liked in the sec story that you were like,

1653
01:44:21.450 --> 01:44:25.470
I don't know this.
Oh wait,
on the second story you told me.

1654
01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:29.570
No,
no,
no.
I don't want to know now

1655
01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:37.250
if we don't talk about it.
Okay,
here isn't another clip.

1656
01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:43.020
<v 14>Sometimes my family gangs up on me like the other night we at dinner and Georgia</v>

1657
01:44:43.701 --> 01:44:47.170
is like,
you're definitely a misogynist.
I'm like,
no,
not aliens.

1658
01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:51.340
Like how actually we were talking about it.
You are.
I go,
excuse me.

1659
01:44:51.341 --> 01:44:55.990
And then Georgia says,
we don't,
we don't like the way you talk to Alexa.

1660
01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:03.750
Are you?
Are you kidding me right now?
Excuse me.
Just think if it was a man,

1661
01:45:03.751 --> 01:45:07.170
you'd treat it with more respect.
I was like,
it's not a man or a woman.

1662
01:45:07.171 --> 01:45:09.030
It's a cylinder.
I bought an,
I'll throw in the fucking,
yeah.

1663
01:45:09.140 --> 01:45:09.973
<v 5>Ooh.</v>

1664
01:45:12.970 --> 01:45:17.870
<v 14>And then one night I get into a fight with Alexa.
My fault.</v>

1665
01:45:17.871 --> 01:45:21.470
I'm drunk,
right?
I'm really drunk and I'm calling her Siri for like two hours.

1666
01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:29.240
I'm like,
turn on the fucking pool lights.
And then I realize I'm like Alexa.

1667
01:45:29.241 --> 01:45:31.940
And the one in the bedroom turns on.
I'm like,
bitch,
shut up.

1668
01:45:31.941 --> 01:45:35.360
I'm not talking to you.
I cleaned the shit out here.

1669
01:45:35.361 --> 01:45:39.020
Here's a turn on the fucking pool and my wife comes in,
she's like,

1670
01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:42.830
who are you yelling at?
I was like,
no one,
isn't that right?
Alexa?

1671
01:45:44.710 --> 01:45:46.290
Alexis?
Like,
yeah,
I fell.

1672
01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:48.493
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

1673
01:45:51.050 --> 01:45:55.730
<v 14>he's a good band.
Leanne.
It's my fault.</v>

1674
01:45:55.731 --> 01:45:56.940
The pool lights are on bird.

1675
01:45:57.910 --> 01:46:01.270
<v 9>I immediately,
the very next week I made that joke better.
Of course,</v>

1676
01:46:01.271 --> 01:46:03.820
that's all it goes.
Fucking drove,
drove me nuts.
It always goes like,

1677
01:46:03.821 --> 01:46:07.750
where did you film Philly that,
uh,
that was the entire second show.

1678
01:46:07.751 --> 01:46:09.550
There's so many things that happened.

1679
01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:13.990
You get the relief of shooting in the next week.
Something in your brain goes,

1680
01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:16.930
don't worry about it.
Oh,
and then you say it different.
You're like mother,

1681
01:46:16.931 --> 01:46:20.470
and the joke is perfect now and he just fucking film it.
Yeah.
I,
you know,

1682
01:46:20.471 --> 01:46:23.440
so funny is I've got jokes now that I,

1683
01:46:23.450 --> 01:46:28.030
in my new hour that I am so much more proud of than in that hour and I wanted,

1684
01:46:28.090 --> 01:46:30.120
I want to do them now.
I want to get them out.
You know,

1685
01:46:30.121 --> 01:46:34.360
like I'm afraid that people are going to come up with these jokes before me.

1686
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:37.440
You know,
like you ever get like antsy with material?
Of course.
Of course.

1687
01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:39.040
It's a good thing.
Yeah,
it's a good thing.

1688
01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:42.910
But how soon until you take your next special tape it?
Yeah,
I would,

1689
01:46:42.970 --> 01:46:47.970
I would assume if I'm on the same pattern that I've been on probably next fall.

1690
01:46:49.700 --> 01:46:54.620
Yeah,
like a year from a year from now basically.
Yeah.
Don't you think?
Yeah.

1691
01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:57.650
I guess I was telling,
I was talking to Whitney Aranda,

1692
01:46:57.660 --> 01:47:01.650
Whitney Cummings on the plane the other day and I was like,
oh,
like if I had had,

1693
01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:06.210
I think if I had had three more months to work on material and that special,

1694
01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:10.920
I probably would have gotten completely board of it.
Like,
like there's a certain,

1695
01:47:10.921 --> 01:47:14.110
there's a sweet spot on when you're still passionate about the material that

1696
01:47:14.130 --> 01:47:18.210
isn't a hundred percent sure.
And then you phone it in when you go,

1697
01:47:18.211 --> 01:47:22.290
when you go on,
see you excited about it still here.
I was perfect.

1698
01:47:22.410 --> 01:47:25.770
The Zip lining story was like right at the port part.

1699
01:47:25.770 --> 01:47:28.700
Like I cannot tell that story now.
I can't tell but story,

1700
01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:31.290
there's two things that I dropped the day after I,

1701
01:47:31.490 --> 01:47:35.880
I taped because I was so sick of saying them.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was like,

1702
01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:39.540
man.
So yeah,
it does get to a point sometimes where you're like,
I got it,

1703
01:47:39.541 --> 01:47:42.630
I got to drop this.
And there was stuff that I,
that I,

1704
01:47:42.990 --> 01:47:45.450
I was touring with that I shot,

1705
01:47:45.810 --> 01:47:48.240
that I cut from the special,

1706
01:47:48.660 --> 01:47:51.810
brought back to my new hour and made better.
I'm like,

1707
01:47:51.811 --> 01:47:55.800
now this is why I dropped it because I just made it better and now I like it.

1708
01:47:56.220 --> 01:48:00.060
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
What's interesting is the,
the um,

1709
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:04.770
the time travel story in there,
I had tried to slide in,

1710
01:48:05.070 --> 01:48:05.940
I tried to side it,

1711
01:48:05.941 --> 01:48:10.380
an iteration of that into my let my showtime special and it just wasn't working

1712
01:48:10.381 --> 01:48:13.740
the way I wanted it to.
And so I was like,
I'll leave it out.
And then like the,

1713
01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:15.240
and then I did the showtime special,

1714
01:48:15.241 --> 01:48:16.590
started going on the road right in new stuff.

1715
01:48:16.890 --> 01:48:20.500
And then that time travels especially bit turned into the best fucking bit.

1716
01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:23.250
And I was like,
oh,
thank God I didn't try to force a day.
Isn't that right?

1717
01:48:23.251 --> 01:48:25.230
Because I think that's kind of what happened to me.

1718
01:48:25.231 --> 01:48:28.260
And like this most recent one,
I,
I cut something around his leg,

1719
01:48:28.290 --> 01:48:30.570
I could leave it in.
And then I,
you know,

1720
01:48:30.571 --> 01:48:33.720
I showed it to a couple people and they were like,
it's not the strongest.

1721
01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:38.820
So I cut it and now I feel like one of them is the best bit in my current hour,

1722
01:48:38.821 --> 01:48:42.630
I think.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I Dunno.
I wish we could go.

1723
01:48:42.631 --> 01:48:46.170
I wish we could go on tour together.
I don't,
I'm tired of doing going by myself.

1724
01:48:46.230 --> 01:48:50.220
Well that ever happen.
We can do gigs together.
Probably not tours.
I know,

1725
01:48:50.221 --> 01:48:53.910
but like I want to go like I was looking at like,
it seems like Dave Chappelle,

1726
01:48:53.911 --> 01:48:58.410
all he does is go and see comics.
Like he's like,
he's at Michelle Wolf show.

1727
01:48:58.411 --> 01:48:59.370
He's the Amy show.

1728
01:48:59.371 --> 01:49:02.160
Is that Chris rock show or either that or they all talk together,

1729
01:49:02.370 --> 01:49:06.930
I guess he puts together shows where he invites people.
Oh,
is that what he does?

1730
01:49:06.931 --> 01:49:09.630
Yeah.
Okay.
So he's like,
do you want to come down to Atlanta?

1731
01:49:10.110 --> 01:49:14.730
And like they were just in Atlanta at the Tabernacle.
Yeah.
Which is a fun,

1732
01:49:14.820 --> 01:49:19.640
it was him.
Jon Stewart.
Chris Rock.
Yeah,
Michelle.
Yeah.

1733
01:49:19.970 --> 01:49:23.790
Couple of dudes with beards.
He also has pretty deep pockets from what I hear.

1734
01:49:24.100 --> 01:49:28.140
And I'm like,
I know that on that number he did that run at radio city last year.

1735
01:49:28.170 --> 01:49:29.400
Yeah Dude.
He was like,

1736
01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:34.200
I'm paying people strawberry money and like they'd be like,

1737
01:49:34.201 --> 01:49:36.630
you're not even like making money on this gig now.
He's like,
I don't give a shit.

1738
01:49:37.310 --> 01:49:41.810
Like,
like I make like 80 million a year bro.
I don't care.
Shut up.

1739
01:49:42.330 --> 01:49:44.940
He doesn't care how many,
what's the,
what's the perfect amount of shows to tape?

1740
01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:48.970
Cause he taped like nine in DC.
It's way too way too,
but if you figure,

1741
01:49:48.971 --> 01:49:53.010
if you did nine shows,
you'd definitely have an amazing special for,

1742
01:49:53.140 --> 01:49:57.180
I think as as like that's a Max.
Why would you want to take more than that?
Yeah,

1743
01:49:57.370 --> 01:50:01.380
I would for,
and it's like if I didn't get it in for
my,

1744
01:50:01.490 --> 01:50:04.240
when I did this one,
the first show I fucking sucked.

1745
01:50:04.660 --> 01:50:08.440
I was tape two shows take two.
Got It too.
And the first one sucked.

1746
01:50:08.530 --> 01:50:13.000
I think Joe said he taped for this last time.
Yeah,
it's good.
Yeah,
he did it.

1747
01:50:13.001 --> 01:50:17.830
He did it in the Wilbur?
Yes.
Yeah.
I think great fucking bang.

1748
01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:22.770
That is in Boston.
I'm going to do that one.
I think in 2019.
Nice.

1749
01:50:24.510 --> 01:50:28.660
We're all touring,
uh,
pretty,
pretty big in 2019 the three of us are,

1750
01:50:28.661 --> 01:50:30.130
we are me and you out at the same time.

1751
01:50:31.530 --> 01:50:35.690
You took a look at my schedule or we were not overlapping,
right?
No,
like some,

1752
01:50:35.770 --> 01:50:39.310
some of the stuff is going to be like different mark,
like same market,

1753
01:50:39.311 --> 01:50:43.000
like two months apart by the closest it gets.
I think that's not bad.

1754
01:50:43.850 --> 01:50:47.500
I almost set you how much I was making these gig on accident.
I can do that.

1755
01:50:47.501 --> 01:50:52.180
I know.
And then I was like,
I probably should.
Um,
now,
uh,

1756
01:50:52.210 --> 01:50:54.160
you do say the n word a lot and your new special.
Hey,

1757
01:50:54.161 --> 01:50:55.270
let's check out this clip right here.

1758
01:50:58.450 --> 01:51:02.110
Uh,
want to make sure,
wait,
can you hear it again?
Yeah.
Okay.

1759
01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:05.070
That'd be great if he became known as the n word.
I have a bit,

1760
01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:09.140
I have a bit with the n word in it.
That is the funniest bit I have right now.

1761
01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:12.880
I can't tell.
I can't tell it because it's not perfect.

1762
01:51:13.270 --> 01:51:15.880
It's not perfect.
And in order to make it a perfect bit,

1763
01:51:15.881 --> 01:51:18.040
I'd have to do it on stage and in order to make it perfect,

1764
01:51:18.070 --> 01:51:22.930
I would have to say the n word 150 times.
No,
I can't be that guy.

1765
01:51:22.990 --> 01:51:25.990
I can't please.
It's so fucking funny.

1766
01:51:26.860 --> 01:51:31.210
It's the funniest fucking bit teasing the audience.
Give it to us.

1767
01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:38.230
No high cause like I just,
it's such a good fucking story.

1768
01:51:39.620 --> 01:51:40.720
What's the big deal?

1769
01:51:45.010 --> 01:51:48.730
Come on.
No,
you're not going to tell us.
No.
If I,
if I figured out off,

1770
01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:53.440
I'll tell I can't use the m word has to be said in this story.

1771
01:51:58.150 --> 01:52:02.380
It has to be in the story and it's not even me saying it.
I understand that.

1772
01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:05.000
So go ahead.
But then I have to know in order to make it good,
I'd,

1773
01:52:05.020 --> 01:52:09.740
I'd have to say the word nonstop.
You're saying someone else says it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1774
01:52:10.050 --> 01:52:13.600
Go for it.
Okay.

1775
01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:18.910
Here it is a good story.
Okay.
Um,
all right.

1776
01:52:19.090 --> 01:52:23.560
So trigger warning,
if you get upset by words obviously.
Yeah,
stop listening.

1777
01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:27.370
So,
um,
so when I was,

1778
01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:32.080
I used to work safe escort for say fast scored at Florida state or I used to

1779
01:52:32.081 --> 01:52:36.550
walk girls' cross campus.
Yeah.
That's what I did for a job in college.

1780
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:39.850
And uh,
how are you qualified to do that?

1781
01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:43.900
Oh my buddy Chris hired me and he's just like walk to go back.

1782
01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:45.770
Like is it like late night kind of stuff?

1783
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:50.920
<v 11>Um,
that wise.
Like is it evening?
You were probably drunk,
no,
sober.</v>

1784
01:52:50.921 --> 01:52:53.420
I was still sober.
So one night,
it was a Saturday night,

1785
01:52:53.421 --> 01:52:57.110
I was working at my buddy Chris Carter,
who was my supervisor.
And he's like,

1786
01:52:57.111 --> 01:52:58.850
hey man,
if you got the keys to the car,

1787
01:52:58.851 --> 01:53:00.440
cause he had a car and accused of the office,

1788
01:53:00.441 --> 01:53:02.360
can you just drop them off at my house?
I have to be there tomorrow.

1789
01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:03.590
And I was like,
yeah.
And he's on me.
He's like,

1790
01:53:03.591 --> 01:53:08.150
I'm having a party so feel free to come in and have a drink.
And I was like,

1791
01:53:08.151 --> 01:53:10.790
all right.
So I smoke a little weed.
I get in my,

1792
01:53:10.791 --> 01:53:14.420
I was driving my sisters blue convertible Ford Mustang.

1793
01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:19.520
I put in some fish back then put my hair in a ponytail and I head over to Chris

1794
01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:24.350
Carter's,
right.
So I pull up and it's a massive fucking party.
I mean it's,
I've,

1795
01:53:24.420 --> 01:53:27.750
I went to school at Florida state and I knew a lot of people in college,

1796
01:53:27.751 --> 01:53:30.890
but I don't know one person that's a party.
I pull in this,
in this,
uh,

1797
01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:34.460
for this convertible and I can't even find a spot to park.

1798
01:53:34.461 --> 01:53:38.450
And I'm bumping into people like it with my car to get through the party and

1799
01:53:38.451 --> 01:53:41.270
people are getting pissed and I'm like,
fuck it.
I'll come back tomorrow.

1800
01:53:41.390 --> 01:53:44.570
I'm not gonna,
I'm not gonna deal with it.
So I pull out of the party,

1801
01:53:44.571 --> 01:53:47.330
it takes me forever to get out of the party and it's in one of those big

1802
01:53:47.331 --> 01:53:48.950
complexes and I pull around to the other side.

1803
01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:54.020
And on the other side is an equally big party,
except it's for Fam U.

1804
01:53:54.110 --> 01:53:58.700
It's all black,
right?
So I pull and I'm like,
shit,
this is nobody,
by the way,

1805
01:53:58.701 --> 01:54:03.701
this is 1994 93 for this is right around the time with the Rodney King,

1806
01:54:05.630 --> 01:54:09.800
Reginald Denny,
and,
and race relations in the south aren't awesome.

1807
01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:13.840
And by the way,
it's Tallahassee.
It's a segregated city.
Pretty much.
Yeah.

1808
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:18.530
So I pull in and I'm thinking,
fuck,
I can't get back.

1809
01:54:18.531 --> 01:54:19.730
I can't turn around and get back out.

1810
01:54:19.731 --> 01:54:21.920
I'm going to have to go through this party and it's fucking ray.

1811
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:26.000
It's equally as big and I'm bumping into people and I can see people like

1812
01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:28.100
fucking Jesus.
And I'm like,
I'm sorry,

1813
01:54:28.101 --> 01:54:32.600
like I get into the dead center of the Party and the car in front of me stops,

1814
01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:36.350
doors open and they disappear.
And now I'm sitting in there in a convertible,

1815
01:54:36.351 --> 01:54:39.320
listen to fish,
I'm hi,
I'm starting to,

1816
01:54:39.530 --> 01:54:41.480
I'm starting to get like panicking Huggett get high.

1817
01:54:41.481 --> 01:54:45.980
You start overthinking things and a black guy just start staring at me like,

1818
01:54:45.981 --> 01:54:49.450
and I could feel him staring at me.
And I'm like,
not even looking,

1819
01:54:49.490 --> 01:54:52.070
just looking straight ahead.
And he's like,
hey white boy,

1820
01:54:52.250 --> 01:54:56.330
you scared and I'll say anything.
I don't even reply to him.
And he goes,

1821
01:54:56.331 --> 01:54:59.390
white boy,
I'm talking to you,
look at me when I speak to you.

1822
01:54:59.570 --> 01:55:03.800
And I kind of look over.
And he goes,
Oh,
you are scared are too.

1823
01:55:03.950 --> 01:55:07.640
And I'm thinking I'm about to get knocked the fuck out.
And I'm like,
no,

1824
01:55:07.641 --> 01:55:11.630
I'm not scared at all.
And he leans on my car like right where the window is,

1825
01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:15.170
leans on it.
He goes,
well,
tell me if you scared now mother fucker.

1826
01:55:15.770 --> 01:55:18.350
And he leans into my car,
hits the brights,
hits the horn,

1827
01:55:18.351 --> 01:55:21.200
and as best white boy voice goes,
no that niggers,

1828
01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:25.280
and he disappeared into the crowd.
Everyone turns around and I'm like,

1829
01:55:27.530 --> 01:55:29.570
guy grabs me,
starts to pull me out of my car.

1830
01:55:29.571 --> 01:55:32.780
My car starts rolling forward and the dude shows up.
He goes,
I'm fucking around.

1831
01:55:32.781 --> 01:55:36.980
I said it.
And they were like,
Whoa,
what?
And they put me back in my car,

1832
01:55:37.010 --> 01:55:40.070
I'm shaking.
And the guy goes,
it looks like you could use a beer.

1833
01:55:40.130 --> 01:55:44.100
I put my car in park,
I leave it running,
I walk into the house,
the guy fucking

1834
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:47.940
<v 9>murder two beers.
I'm like,
oh.
And he's telling everyone at the party,</v>

1835
01:55:48.180 --> 01:55:50.370
I think it'd be a great story for stays,
but in order to do it,

1836
01:55:50.371 --> 01:55:52.310
I have to say the n word,
you know,

1837
01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:57.300
you said you have to say it 150 times to get the bit perfect.
It doesn't,

1838
01:55:59.230 --> 01:56:03.420
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I'd have to,
I'd have to do,

1839
01:56:03.430 --> 01:56:06.600
it's the bit doesn't have a great ending,
so it would need a better ending,

1840
01:56:06.930 --> 01:56:10.310
like the,
and it's just,
it was just the funniest thing that ever happened.

1841
01:56:10.730 --> 01:56:14.270
<v 0>It's going to end up being like,
it's going to end up being like a,</v>

1842
01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:16.100
almost like an interstitial set.

1843
01:56:16.101 --> 01:56:19.340
Like it's going to set up something else for you.
That's what it feels like.

1844
01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:22.400
It's one of those bits where you think it's the end bit,

1845
01:56:22.460 --> 01:56:25.330
but it's actually getting you somewhere,
you know?
I bet you're right.

1846
01:56:25.430 --> 01:56:27.290
Like you'll figure out another story and you're like,
Oh,

1847
01:56:27.291 --> 01:56:30.590
if I tell this story right before that story,

1848
01:56:30.620 --> 01:56:32.480
it's going to make the end story better.

1849
01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:35.550
It's going to be like an example of something.
I Dunno,
but I know what you mean.

1850
01:56:36.030 --> 01:56:38.330
<v 9>Oh,
he's burnt and racist comics.
That's right.</v>

1851
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:44.150
We did mention these guys,
number one,
racist comic in America.
Move over.

1852
01:56:44.151 --> 01:56:48.950

Um,

1853
01:56:48.951 --> 01:56:53.540

Oh,

1854
01:56:53.541 --> 01:56:54.860

Oh Shit.

1855
01:56:54.940 --> 01:56:58.210
<v 0>Oh,

Let's,
uh,
let's give them a little sample of what he did.</v>

1856
01:57:07.260 --> 01:57:11.980
<v 8>Christina could GST can now spray it up though.
I do support Chrysler,</v>

1857
01:57:12.340 --> 01:57:16.160
Chrysler Burke,
Reznor,
you know science right up the Mesh.

1858
01:57:16.180 --> 01:57:19.420
Locks are the things we can keep on pushing.

1859
01:57:21.190 --> 01:57:25.370
Keep on,
keep on doing it as well too.

1860
01:57:25.650 --> 01:57:30.650
You know saying straight up now cause he loves his counts real.

1861
01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:34.130
<v 9>He just said that one too.</v>

1862
01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:37.130
<v 0>We're just setting you up.
Hold on now we're going to see what he said.</v>

1863
01:57:37.390 --> 01:57:40.190
<v 8>Eight Burke Christ a buys.</v>

1864
01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:46.960
You should know the TL.
Paula.
Good Hope you understood as I keep it.

1865
01:57:47.050 --> 01:57:48.580
Two thoughts.
Shoot.
Can you,

1866
01:57:48.750 --> 01:57:53.160
you promise to donate $10,000 to a children's hospital?

1867
01:57:53.620 --> 01:57:56.470
He lied or phone and as to no,

1868
01:57:56.480 --> 01:58:01.240
no to keeping it so to soap.
Really no big deal.

1869
01:58:01.780 --> 01:58:04.650
<v 9>It's pretty good.
So I love it and I loved it.</v>

1870
01:58:04.660 --> 01:58:08.510
He's worried about my health clearly with an open sore on his mouth.

1871
01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:14.570
Crazy.
He's like,
you did it again,
man.
Jesus Christ.

1872
01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:18.540
He came out.
Oh my God.

1873
01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:21.380
<v 8>Quick kitten.</v>

1874
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:26.390
He got to where he got into doing what he does.

1875
01:58:26.391 --> 01:58:30.620
You know saint really started to love,
love,

1876
01:58:32.020 --> 01:58:32.853
hate.

1877
01:58:33.730 --> 01:58:36.490
<v 9>All right,
that's pretty good.
Oh my God.</v>

1878
01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:40.710
What do you think you're going to clap back or what?
Oh,
probably.

1879
01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:45.640
And I'll with his eyebrows.
Where are they?
Crazy looks.

1880
01:58:45.641 --> 01:58:50.170
Thank you so much.
Job.
Crazy.
Lokes I ran into the guy that made his barbecue.

1881
01:58:50.171 --> 01:58:53.530
Do you remember that guy?
Yeah.
Read them toward the store.
That's right.
Who's?

1882
01:58:53.570 --> 01:58:57.490
That'll match barbecue.
Oh,
so good.
Wait a minute.
Uh,
what's his name?

1883
01:58:59.410 --> 01:59:03.900
Didn't he have the Burger place?
It's not the guy.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1884
01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:05.980
You think the Burger place closed?
That's right.

1885
01:59:05.981 --> 01:59:09.730
And then he lives in Portland now or oh,
that's right.
He moved.
Moved.
Yeah,

1886
01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:11.020
I remember that.
I remember.

1887
01:59:11.021 --> 01:59:14.410
It's crazy when you know someone through the Internet and then you run into them

1888
01:59:14.710 --> 01:59:19.240
and they're like,
Oh hey,
I'm a no Susko Hannah.
And you're like,
oh,
I know you.

1889
01:59:20.020 --> 01:59:24.070
So weird.
Oh my God.
Um,
do you remember when these came out?

1890
01:59:24.071 --> 01:59:27.790
Like a couple of years ago?
Can we,
we brought all this stuff we were looking at.

1891
01:59:27.791 --> 01:59:29.770
What's the plate today?
When you were coming?
Yeah.

1892
01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:31.073
<v 15>Thanks.</v>

1893
01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:34.313
<v 9>Oh,</v>

1894
02:00:00.130 --> 02:00:01.920
<v 12>it's like songs,
people energy.</v>

1895
02:00:06.260 --> 02:00:07.850
You'll shoot motherfuckers.

1896
02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:16.300
<v 9>That's one of the best ones.
Yeah.
The gaping guy.
I like the golf one,</v>

1897
02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:21.220
the golf one eye shadow dance.
Oh yeah,
my finger.

1898
02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:24.910
My ass.
That was the boat.
Is that right?
But,
but,

1899
02:00:24.940 --> 02:00:29.400
but as far as so many birdies fast,
I've always said,
how come my f like,

1900
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:32.720
I feel like we share fans,
but you guys got all the autistic ones.

1901
02:00:33.710 --> 02:00:37.430
We really do have very talented people who listen to the show.
It's bizarre.

1902
02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:39.710
I love when people come up and they're like,
uh,
uh,

1903
02:00:39.711 --> 02:00:42.230
at the end of the show and they s they won.

1904
02:00:42.290 --> 02:00:46.920
They want you to know that I love you on,
uh,
your mom's house.
I was like,
Oh yeah,

1905
02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:50.510
no.
Like I don't really listen to your podcasts that much.
And I was like,
oh cool.

1906
02:00:50.540 --> 02:00:51.720
Thanks.
Yeah.
But thanks a lot.

1907
02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:55.660
<v 15>Let's say we are describing people at last ones.</v>

1908
02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:02.270
Let's say the adjective means fat.
Uh,

1909
02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:05.350
let's try using that sentence.
Oh my God,
I remember this.

1910
02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:10.660
Let's say Bob's Chrysler,
oh,

1911
02:01:10.661 --> 02:01:15.180
pesos the lab and every lab together.

1912
02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:20.240
Badass Chrysler,
how basis exactly.

1913
02:01:20.660 --> 02:01:24.930
<v 9>Cool.
Basis x,
obese,
obese.</v>

1914
02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:28.800
But he goes and then you see his like his throw is like perfect.
He's like,
Eh,

1915
02:01:28.801 --> 02:01:30.680
it just burn is a huge fat guy.
Yeah.

1916
02:01:32.620 --> 02:01:33.830
Just some cage factor.

1917
02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:40.070
I love when the fee,
like there was this guy that was

1918
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:44.750
<v 11>like a said something about me being a fat fuck online the other day and I</v>

1919
02:01:44.751 --> 02:01:48.710
looked at his profile and he's so fat and then his name's like fat Mike.

1920
02:01:48.950 --> 02:01:51.680
<v 3>Yeah.
Cause they just want to be in on it.
Yeah.</v>

1921
02:01:51.681 --> 02:01:54.020
I had the same thing on an Instagram things guy was like,
Tom,

1922
02:01:54.030 --> 02:01:56.780
you're a huge fat piece of shit.
And I was like,
who is this motherfucker?

1923
02:01:57.140 --> 02:02:01.100
And then I'd go to his page and he was at least 80 pounds bigger than me.

1924
02:02:01.140 --> 02:02:05.150
<v 11>Yeah.
Yeah.
He's like,
dude,
my favorite joke on your last special,
I don't know,
I'm,</v>

1925
02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:05.370
I'm,

1926
02:02:05.370 --> 02:02:08.910
I don't know if it was during your last special where I w but is someone going,

1927
02:02:08.930 --> 02:02:10.680
you know,
I figured if Tom could do it,
I can do it.

1928
02:02:11.130 --> 02:02:12.330
<v 3>Oh yeah.
And that's it.
The last thing</v>

1929
02:02:16.900 --> 02:02:21.150
so much better.
I love when people say that.
I figured if you could do it,

1930
02:02:21.151 --> 02:02:23.820
I could do it.
I'm like,
can you do what I'm doing right now?

1931
02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.580
I don't fucking think so.
Alright.
What's your favorite thing?

1932
02:02:26.610 --> 02:02:29.450
What's your least favorite thing people say to you?
Like,
you know,
um,

1933
02:02:29.490 --> 02:02:31.290
like after they come up to you to show and they're like,

1934
02:02:31.291 --> 02:02:34.620
good job instead of just being like,
that was awesome.
Like they'd be like,

1935
02:02:34.621 --> 02:02:37.670
you're pretty good.
You're pretty good.
That one irritated.

1936
02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:41.010
We always talk about like a backhanded compliments you get from people.

1937
02:02:41.340 --> 02:02:43.050
Like they're like not bad or like

1938
02:02:43.290 --> 02:02:45.030
<v 11>funny stuff.
Yeah.
I think it's kind of funny.</v>

1939
02:02:45.031 --> 02:02:49.260
And you're like the fuck I don't like,
I can't,

1940
02:02:49.650 --> 02:02:54.480
I don't really listen 100%.
Yeah.
Like,
I mean,
like I just tap out a little bit.

1941
02:02:54.510 --> 02:02:55.860
That feels like you.
Yeah.

1942
02:02:56.020 --> 02:03:00.210
And only because the one thing I cannot stand,

1943
02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:04.680
and it happens so much to me is people slapping me on the back.

1944
02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:10.350
Oh,
physics when you're shirtless.
Yes.
And because so many people like Anne,

1945
02:03:10.351 --> 02:03:13.440
I spend the majority of the time when I do my meet and greets,

1946
02:03:13.950 --> 02:03:17.850
looking down the line for the guy that's going to slap me and it's always some

1947
02:03:17.851 --> 02:03:21.660
guy who rips his shirt off and he's like,
Bro,
and he just comes in wide.

1948
02:03:21.900 --> 02:03:25.770
I spent so much time in line or like looking down that line for that person

1949
02:03:25.950 --> 02:03:27.960
because I hate when people stop and prepare for it.

1950
02:03:27.961 --> 02:03:31.490
Do you do like no and I never can see it coming and then the guys who think it

1951
02:03:31.500 --> 02:03:34.410
will be,
they never do it.
It's some guy he didn't fucking see it.

1952
02:03:34.620 --> 02:03:36.900
It's always a real harm firm handshake.

1953
02:03:37.020 --> 02:03:39.720
They pull it in tight and smack you on the back bro.

1954
02:03:39.870 --> 02:03:44.010
It's like the bro Hug thing,
dude,
and I do all my meet and greets shortlist.

1955
02:03:44.011 --> 02:03:48.750
I had a guy in Spokane who came in,
he like shorts off.
I was like,
yeah,
of course.

1956
02:03:49.050 --> 02:03:51.120
And then I grab him.
I go,
wow,
you're really hot.
And he's like,

1957
02:03:51.130 --> 02:03:55.410
I got a pretty bad fever.
I was like,
I was like,
Hey,
are you sick?
And he was like,

1958
02:03:55.411 --> 02:03:57.930
Eh,
I'm not going to miss this though.
I was like,
oh my God.
I was like,
no,

1959
02:03:57.931 --> 02:04:02.400
I'm going to get sick.
Yeah.
I would say if I'm a burden,

1960
02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:04.920
they definitely have zero regard for his hell no,

1961
02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:08.130
no way they're worried about is hell dude.
I had the one thing I,

1962
02:04:08.250 --> 02:04:13.090
I love when girls take their shirt off.
Oh,
that happens all lot.
Braless too.

1963
02:04:13.140 --> 02:04:16.290
Or just,
I've had a few brawlers I had a few bro.
I've had,

1964
02:04:16.380 --> 02:04:20.270
I've had a lot more broad lists them broad and then,
uh,

1965
02:04:20.370 --> 02:04:23.730
girls always want to lick my nipples.
Oh God.
You're like,

1966
02:04:23.731 --> 02:04:26.070
that sounds the closest I'll ever get the cheating.

1967
02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:31.180
And then I remember I was telling you that you liked this will show,

1968
02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:35.550
incorporate it.
No,
she does.
Yeah,
she,
yeah,
I like a little boy.
Um,
she,
uh,

1969
02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:38.220
I had these lesbians,
these to you guys

1970
02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:39.053
<v 3>and your sex.</v>

1971
02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:44.090
<v 11>I have these lesbians in DC.
This is right when me two was coming out.
Yeah.</v>

1972
02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:48.590
And uh,
they came up in there like we haven't played with a dick in a long time.

1973
02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:52.130
And I was like,
oh,
and they all just to take pictures.

1974
02:04:52.131 --> 02:04:55.040
And then they all kept playing with my Dick,
like grabbing my dick.

1975
02:04:55.041 --> 02:04:57.080
And I was like,
I was like,
Hey,
well,
easy ladies.
And then,

1976
02:04:57.290 --> 02:05:01.520
but they just wouldn't say it was four of them and it got so aggressive that

1977
02:05:01.521 --> 02:05:04.880
people in line were uncomfortable with it.
But I was cool that

1978
02:05:08.410 --> 02:05:13.250
there was,
they were,
they,
they assaulted me hardest spot.
Yeah.

1979
02:05:13.390 --> 02:05:15.580
<v 3>Did,
uh,
like that.
Let me give you a kiss.</v>

1980
02:05:15.590 --> 02:05:17.080
I'll give it a kiss and they go back and forth.

1981
02:05:17.150 --> 02:05:20.180
<v 11>No,
they just kept grabbing it at different like,
so when I get one to stop,</v>

1982
02:05:20.181 --> 02:05:22.060
the other one will grab it.
And then they,
and it was like,

1983
02:05:22.140 --> 02:05:24.900
<v 3>how often does this happen to you?
It's my life.
This is my life.</v>

1984
02:05:25.050 --> 02:05:29.000
<v 11>Go.
I've,
I get critiques of tough from Tom.</v>

1985
02:05:29.540 --> 02:05:31.400
There'll always like,
in Columbus this weekend,
I'm like,

1986
02:05:31.401 --> 02:05:34.220
Tom wouldn't do a meet and greet with us.
And I was like,
yeah.
I was like,
yeah,

1987
02:05:34.221 --> 02:05:37.490
I know he's smart.
I'm the one that's sitting out here shaking.
I should,

1988
02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:40.160
I must have shaken 200 hands after every fucking show.

1989
02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:43.000
<v 3>There was so afraid of disease,</v>

1990
02:05:43.001 --> 02:05:45.790
of catching sick and then bringing it home to my two babies and everything.
Like,

1991
02:05:45.810 --> 02:05:46.240
oh,

1992
02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:47.880
<v 11>I just,
I think I've been,
I've,</v>

1993
02:05:47.950 --> 02:05:51.920
I've had a head cold for this whole fucking year course,
but it's an allergies.

1994
02:05:51.921 --> 02:05:54.950
I get it.
As soon as I come back to la,
my sinuses tighten up.

1995
02:05:55.050 --> 02:05:58.140
<v 3>I mean,
I,
the people really are you really gonna get mad at me for me,
I've,</v>

1996
02:05:58.160 --> 02:05:59.170
I mean,
people like you're not doing,

1997
02:05:59.540 --> 02:06:00.860
<v 11>oh,
they don't get mad.
They don't get mad.</v>

1998
02:06:00.861 --> 02:06:02.140
I don't think they really genuinely good.

1999
02:06:02.190 --> 02:06:04.350
<v 3>No,
I know it's like,
but like for instance,
the Columbus is like,</v>

2000
02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:06.720
there's two shows a night.
It's gonna make,

2001
02:06:06.721 --> 02:06:09.600
you said like the second show was starting as you're doing a meet and greet,

2002
02:06:09.601 --> 02:06:13.380
like,
I can't,
I don't have your energy dude.
Like I'm done.
Yeah.
I mean,
you know,

2003
02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:15.390
like I do the show and I'm like,
that's all.

2004
02:06:15.560 --> 02:06:20.310
I can barely muster a fucking hello to somebody and you're out.
I wish I could,

2005
02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:25.100
hey,
you know,
laughing and I just can't do it man.
I'm not like you on that.

2006
02:06:25.250 --> 02:06:26.540
<v 11>I wish I was started doing it.</v>

2007
02:06:26.541 --> 02:06:28.760
Now I can't stop doing it because I've already started doing it.

2008
02:06:28.761 --> 02:06:33.470
And so when I didn't do a meet and greet for the Wilbur show and people were

2009
02:06:33.471 --> 02:06:34.670
fucking irate.
Right.

2010
02:06:34.700 --> 02:06:37.850
<v 3>Cause they know you as the meet and greet guy either like he hates people,</v>

2011
02:06:37.851 --> 02:06:38.610
don't worry about it.

2012
02:06:38.610 --> 02:06:42.150
<v 11>Yeah.
And Leanne was like,
there's people out there that they were like,</v>

2013
02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:45.450
she's like,
I think you really should go out there.
And I was like,
I can't,

2014
02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:47.040
there's 1200 people out there,

2015
02:06:47.041 --> 02:06:51.330
I can't go out and we're doing a second show in time.
And then people are like,

2016
02:06:51.510 --> 02:06:53.700
well if I knew he wasn't going to a meet and greet,
I wouldn't even come.

2017
02:06:54.140 --> 02:06:55.840
And I was like,
wait,
what?
And like,

2018
02:06:55.950 --> 02:07:00.180
cause a lot of people make like posters or bring stuff for me to have.

2019
02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:05.580
And so you know,
and then everyone wants to tell me like their version of like,

2020
02:07:05.820 --> 02:07:08.310
oh me and my buddy was just like you and Tom.
Yeah,
we bought it.

2021
02:07:08.340 --> 02:07:10.750
We've lost balls and yeah,
he was drunk.

2022
02:07:11.860 --> 02:07:13.310
<v 3>It is odd though that,</v>

2023
02:07:13.370 --> 02:07:16.610
I mean comedians are really the only performers where it's expected that you

2024
02:07:16.611 --> 02:07:17.900
would go out and meet the audience.

2025
02:07:17.901 --> 02:07:21.430
Like you don't go see your favorite band and then expect them to stand outside

2026
02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:25.230
dodger stadium and handshake everybody.
You know what I mean?
Like you,

2027
02:07:25.231 --> 02:07:28.520
you're not going to go see Weezer wherever you like in and then be like,
Hey,

2028
02:07:28.521 --> 02:07:32.050
can I meet you guys?
And if I don't I'm going to be irate about it.
Like it's fun.

2029
02:07:32.120 --> 02:07:36.040
It's cars are or actors.
And you had asked a lot to

2030
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:38.020
<v 0>like in,
in tweets,
people will be like,</v>

2031
02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:42.880
are you meeting people after the Welmont a theater show?
And I'm just like,

2032
02:07:43.150 --> 02:07:43.983
what do you think?

2033
02:07:45.180 --> 02:07:47.790
<v 11>That's fucking 1800 people.
Yeah,</v>

2034
02:07:48.900 --> 02:07:51.870
I did it when we did those theaters.
I would go out,
they were being,

2035
02:07:51.960 --> 02:07:55.780
they would be waiting in the,
in the alleys.
Yeah,
like behind,
yeah.

2036
02:07:55.880 --> 02:07:58.290
<v 0>That's okay.
That's cool.
I've had the the uh,</v>

2037
02:07:58.440 --> 02:08:00.750
when they're waiting by the car because then it's like,

2038
02:08:00.900 --> 02:08:03.480
it's pretty limited amount and of course you take time to do it,

2039
02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:08.450
but an organized theater meet and greet dude,
that is a multiple hour event.

2040
02:08:08.600 --> 02:08:11.710
<v 11>Oh,
I stopped doing shots with fans because I only a good idea.
Yeah,</v>

2041
02:08:11.720 --> 02:08:15.830
really good idea.
I mean it was getting aggressive and then now I just go,

2042
02:08:15.831 --> 02:08:18.140
I can't do shots and people,
people are like,
seriously.

2043
02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:22.730
And then inevitably they fucking monster down whatever shot they bought from me

2044
02:08:22.850 --> 02:08:25.000
for themselves.
And then I'm like,
you're going to be sick like,

2045
02:08:25.090 --> 02:08:28.040
but there's no fun in this.
Of course.
Do you drink in this special?

2046
02:08:29.240 --> 02:08:33.860
I didn't drink.
I think I get a bigger like pay off.

2047
02:08:34.070 --> 02:08:36.290
I think people think I am drunk all the time.

2048
02:08:36.650 --> 02:08:39.890
Like I don't drink on stage but I will bring a drink on stage with me.

2049
02:08:40.100 --> 02:08:43.910
But I don't really drink on stage because I'm talking the whole time and I only

2050
02:08:43.911 --> 02:08:45.590
really drink if I am going to drink,

2051
02:08:45.860 --> 02:08:50.340
I drink it at like the 55 minute mark on the second show.
Yeah,
I'll go.

2052
02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:51.860
I'll have you.
You're going to,
you're almost done.
Well,

2053
02:08:51.861 --> 02:08:54.800
you gotta tell them machine story in,
I'll pound it and I'll be like,
hey,

2054
02:08:54.830 --> 02:08:57.430
by the way,
is this the one?
Yeah.
Yes,

2055
02:08:57.760 --> 02:09:00.730
<v 16>I know it already.
I love it.
Yeah.
This is my favorite song.</v>

2056
02:09:00.731 --> 02:09:03.160
It probably ever submitted.
I just,

2057
02:09:03.161 --> 02:09:06.680
it's so God said [inaudible] all talent.

2058
02:09:09.270 --> 02:09:10.600
Who blippy plastic.

2059
02:09:12.910 --> 02:09:17.740
I remember I wrote the song,
there's so many great songs.

2060
02:09:18.180 --> 02:09:21.630
I would dance to this at a club.
That's how much I like this one.
Yeah,

2061
02:09:22.070 --> 02:09:23.900
that's my shadow.
My Gosh.

2062
02:09:24.140 --> 02:09:28.760
<v 15>Stuff.
But</v>

2063
02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:34.760
this is a good song.
It is a good song.
I'm telling him.
He's fine.

2064
02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:37.353
He's fine.

2065
02:09:42.410 --> 02:09:43.243
He's fine.

2066
02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:45.553
<v 0>Ready?
Yeah.</v>

2067
02:09:48.230 --> 02:09:50.820
<v 15>I
shadowed</v>

2068
02:10:08.340 --> 02:10:13.110
<v 0>so silly.
It's good.
And see that's even,</v>

2069
02:10:13.111 --> 02:10:15.510
that thing was a,
that's actually a tip of that.

2070
02:10:15.540 --> 02:10:20.370
Like it's a wink at us making bad like our own,
our songs,

2071
02:10:20.430 --> 02:10:23.940
our songs that we had in that sense.
That's right.
What was that one called?

2072
02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:26.930
That was,
I made one called,
um,
uh,

2073
02:10:28.290 --> 02:10:32.870
or like animal sound.
No,
mine was Animal Sam then mine was Kentucky.
I Dunno.

2074
02:10:32.930 --> 02:10:33.763
Something like that.

2075
02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:35.610
<v 11>I never gotten any fucking feedback.</v>

2076
02:10:35.611 --> 02:10:38.880
No one ever listened to my own lists in between my toes.
I kind of turned me on.

2077
02:10:39.470 --> 02:10:43.170
Um,
I never,
when I wrote that the ballot of big Tommy bonds.
Yeah,

2078
02:10:43.230 --> 02:10:46.460
no one ever fucking listen to that.
Really?
Yeah,
no,
I put it up online.

2079
02:10:46.470 --> 02:10:51.020
It was like 30,000 views.
Nothing.
That's a lot.
No,
not a lot.

2080
02:10:53.070 --> 02:10:55.410
I think you'd get more on your little Edward's story you shared.

2081
02:10:58.510 --> 02:11:03.270
Now I wrote the n word in my book.
Oh,
this is great.

2082
02:11:03.450 --> 02:11:04.500
Yeah.
And I was like,

2083
02:11:04.501 --> 02:11:08.280
and I got to the part where I was going to read it and I was like,
I was like,

2084
02:11:08.281 --> 02:11:11.880
I can't say that word.
Am I on,
on an audio book is going to like,

2085
02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:15.360
I don't want to go down in history that way.
Right.
So what'd you do?

2086
02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:19.860
I called up Omar Dorsey as a black friend of mine and our daughters are friends.

2087
02:11:19.860 --> 02:11:23.160
I was like,
Yo,
oh mark,
you help me read my book.
He was like,
yeah,
anything man,

2088
02:11:23.250 --> 02:11:26.730
cause he came over to the studio and I was like,
uh,
here you go.

2089
02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:30.900
Just say that word was like,
what word?
It was the n word.
He goes,

2090
02:11:31.860 --> 02:11:34.620
you just called me over to say the n word and I was like,
yeah,
can you do it?

2091
02:11:36.030 --> 02:11:39.000
He's like,
yeah,
sure.
And he did it and I said,
can you do it?

2092
02:11:39.001 --> 02:11:41.550
You're doing it like too much like a black guy.
You do it like a white guy.

2093
02:11:41.930 --> 02:11:44.100
He was like,
why don't you show me how it's supposed to be done?

2094
02:11:48.550 --> 02:11:53.180
My Bitch Nigga by your own damn fries.
No that guy ain't shit.
Fuck.

2095
02:11:53.220 --> 02:11:55.140
Got Nothing on me.
Right.
Nothing.

2096
02:11:55.200 --> 02:11:58.170
There were white folks and then they're ignorant motherfuckers like you.
Yeah.

2097
02:11:58.830 --> 02:12:01.920
What's that from?
That's where his audio book before he became president.

2098
02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:06.430
Oh for real.
So it's just like you're talking about,

2099
02:12:06.660 --> 02:12:11.320
you know what's crazy bitch Nigga the first night of crazy to have time breath.

2100
02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:15.750
Do you remember the first time you ever heard downward?
I remember,

2101
02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:20.750
<v 0>I remember hearing it and yeah,
pretty much.</v>

2102
02:12:21.020 --> 02:12:25.310
I have a memory of like 13 like that's pretty much that memory.

2103
02:12:25.311 --> 02:12:30.210
And then I remember being yelled at me 14 yeah we yelled at you.
Yeah.

2104
02:12:30.211 --> 02:12:32.840
So weird cause I was and I was shocked.

2105
02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:37.740
Well it was right after I moved to the state of Florida.
Um,

2106
02:12:38.070 --> 02:12:40.870
Florida is such a great place.
Yeah.
It's Kinda,
it's that,

2107
02:12:40.910 --> 02:12:44.780
that part is as you know,
because all through before then I lived in the Midwest.

2108
02:12:44.781 --> 02:12:49.781
Not to say that there's no racist people and I really never casually heard that

2109
02:12:49.881 --> 02:12:54.880
said anywhere Florida in Cincinnati.
I mean,
there's obvious people say it,

2110
02:12:54.881 --> 02:12:59.090
but I'm saying I didn't hear it as a little kid.
Uh,
Minneapolis in the schools.

2111
02:12:59.091 --> 02:13:01.580
I went to Milwaukee,
nothing Florida.

2112
02:13:01.581 --> 02:13:05.900
Like day one I played basketball and uh,

2113
02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:09.390
I was just school in this kid.
I mean,
you know,
I was,

2114
02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:12.170
I used to play basketball a lot,
so I was just better than him.
He was like,

2115
02:13:12.171 --> 02:13:17.000
you play like a fucking,
and I was like,
what?
And I was like,

2116
02:13:17.001 --> 02:13:20.990
what?
He's like,
what?
It's a compliment.
I was like,

2117
02:13:21.950 --> 02:13:25.010
what?
And I,
I mean,
I was stunned.
That was,
I mean,
I was,

2118
02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:28.350
I was a freshman in high school.
I had not,
I had not heard it.
No,

2119
02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:31.980
my parents said since beginning of time.
But also my parents

2120
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:34.560
<v 9>are foreigners,
so they would,
they don't even know all the gravity,</v>

2121
02:13:34.890 --> 02:13:36.990
so I would hear that word all the time.
You're like,
ah.

2122
02:13:37.340 --> 02:13:40.430
<v 11>My parents never said it.
First time I ever heard it,
I was in first grade,</v>

2123
02:13:40.431 --> 02:13:44.120
I was in that neighborhood and there was a bunch of black kids.
First grade.

2124
02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:46.880
First grade,
yeah,
first grade,

2125
02:13:47.130 --> 02:13:50.630
a bunch of black kids coming to our neighborhood to play us in football and they

2126
02:13:50.631 --> 02:13:55.280
have,
my football had a Duke junior and I knew it was mine because my,

2127
02:13:55.340 --> 02:13:58.040
the lake,
we used to play in the street and to the laces.
It all run out.

2128
02:13:58.340 --> 02:14:03.340
And my dad had released it with a shoe lace with a Tan shoelace and they had my

2129
02:14:03.591 --> 02:14:07.730
football,
we lost my football,
they have my football and the two redneck guys,

2130
02:14:07.731 --> 02:14:10.950
one guy,
there's finger,
the girl under the tree said,

2131
02:14:11.340 --> 02:14:13.400
you got to fight them for your football.
And,

2132
02:14:13.401 --> 02:14:16.210
but the kids were older and one of the brothers,
I forget their names,

2133
02:14:16.211 --> 02:14:16.821
Daryl and Darren,

2134
02:14:16.821 --> 02:14:20.900
I think it goes off item and they started fighting in Darlington,

2135
02:14:20.910 --> 02:14:25.460
his front yard and Darryl and Doris Dad came out and started chanting fight,

2136
02:14:25.461 --> 02:14:27.500
fight and we're in a white,
white don't,

2137
02:14:27.501 --> 02:14:32.300
when we all jump in and put his arm on me,
put him,
put his arm on me and said,

2138
02:14:32.870 --> 02:14:37.160
he's fighting for you.
You chant it.
I was in first grade.
I was like,
all right,

2139
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:39.770
fuck,
it sounds like a fun ride.
And then I'll remember.

2140
02:14:40.050 --> 02:14:42.650
And then and then and then by heard it,

2141
02:14:43.010 --> 02:14:45.860
I never heard it when it wasn't a used a lot in high school.

2142
02:14:45.861 --> 02:14:48.050
I'd never heard it in high school,
but like it would be sad,

2143
02:14:48.320 --> 02:14:52.220
but we had a black friend,
but I would hear the word,
but it wasn't like,

2144
02:14:52.250 --> 02:14:55.910
it wasn't like used.
And then when I went to college it was used a lot in Fsu.

2145
02:14:55.911 --> 02:14:59.840
Oh Dude,
the flu,
the worst flu,
flu around a lot.

2146
02:15:00.500 --> 02:15:03.560
But race,
racial tensions were kind of fucked up back then.

2147
02:15:04.190 --> 02:15:07.970
But here's the crazy thing,
and I said this to,
I said this too,

2148
02:15:08.870 --> 02:15:11.570
maybe I said maybe I did this in a bit one time,

2149
02:15:11.810 --> 02:15:16.810
but used to be the m were refused in like phrasiology all the time in itself.

2150
02:15:18.110 --> 02:15:21.950
Like it was used as a verb,
almost like in conjunction with the verb.

2151
02:15:22.650 --> 02:15:25.190
Do you mean so like I'll just tell you the bit

2152
02:15:26.180 --> 02:15:30.230
<v 9>he's so passionate about the etymology.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.</v>

2153
02:15:30.231 --> 02:15:34.260
You really love your n word.
Jesus Christ.
If you like,
how you like,

2154
02:15:34.270 --> 02:15:39.230
how you like how you send me predict my behavior and I fall right into it.

2155
02:15:40.100 --> 02:15:43.400
The new racist comic.
I'm like hugging you some,
I'll give you some fodder.

2156
02:15:44.120 --> 02:15:47.540
We actually set it up and you came through.
You know,
I deliver guys.

2157
02:15:47.541 --> 02:15:51.260
So interested.
Okay.
Reminiscence.
First time he heard the word.

2158
02:15:51.940 --> 02:15:52.810
<v 11>Okay.
What?</v>

2159
02:15:53.030 --> 02:15:54.620
<v 9>Here's a clip from the special.</v>

2160
02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:00.110
That's secret time is your time.

2161
02:16:01.130 --> 02:16:05.600
<v 11>Um,
I should have called an n word time.
Huh?
Oh wait.
So tell me,</v>

2162
02:16:05.601 --> 02:16:07.780
tell me the thing you were saying.
I was the,
uh,

2163
02:16:07.940 --> 02:16:12.290
when Leann worked at the apartment building,
I mean this is like,
I don't,

2164
02:16:12.310 --> 02:16:15.260
once again,
I'm just telling all the bits that I would never tell on stage,

2165
02:16:15.530 --> 02:16:18.610
but this is Florida for Ya.
Um,
when we,

2166
02:16:18.620 --> 02:16:20.750
Atlanta worked at the part of building the,
uh,

2167
02:16:20.770 --> 02:16:23.540
we had a black guy that used to be,
it was our maintenance man.

2168
02:16:23.541 --> 02:16:26.390
His name was Antonio and I knew him really well.

2169
02:16:26.391 --> 02:16:30.580
He's to come by and watch Monday night football at our place and one morning I'm

2170
02:16:30.581 --> 02:16:31.031
looking,

2171
02:16:31.031 --> 02:16:36.031
I'm getting taken the girls in the elevator and there's a note on the elevator

2172
02:16:36.071 --> 02:16:39.550
door and I'm reading it like by the buttons and as I'm reading it,

2173
02:16:39.551 --> 02:16:43.030
Antonio Walks in,
he sees I'm reading it and he goes,
oh.
So as you know,

2174
02:16:43.031 --> 02:16:45.040
like pointing to the note,
so as you know,
some kids in the neighborhood,

2175
02:16:45.100 --> 02:16:47.710
he's going to get an a little ding dong ditch.
And I was like,
what?

2176
02:16:48.190 --> 02:16:50.950
He's like some kids in the neighborhood.
I was like,
what the fuck is that?

2177
02:16:50.951 --> 02:16:53.650
And he's like,
Ding Dong ditch.
You never played know what ditching he was a kid.

2178
02:16:54.170 --> 02:16:55.360
I was like,
I don't think I did.
And he's like,

2179
02:16:55.361 --> 02:16:58.210
you go up and knock on my post door,
bail out mobile,
come out,

2180
02:16:58.211 --> 02:17:01.060
you see him funk come out,
you fall out laughing.
I was like,
Oh yeah,

2181
02:17:01.061 --> 02:17:04.120
we did that as kid.
He's like,
what did you call it?
I was like,
nothing.

2182
02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:08.770
Because when in the south it was called Edward Knockin.
Oh,

2183
02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:11.890
that's what it was called.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's in the south.
And I was like,

2184
02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:16.180
oh my God.
Like I'd never,
I never called it that,
but that's what I knew it was.

2185
02:17:16.390 --> 02:17:17.290
I never really did it.

2186
02:17:17.291 --> 02:17:19.840
I don't know what kind of a fucking lunatic knocks on the door runs away.

2187
02:17:20.040 --> 02:17:24.710
<v 0>I remember this one of those things I have a memory of with you.
Yeah,</v>

2188
02:17:24.860 --> 02:17:28.650
it was because I knew it as Ding Dong ditching.
I did.
I never heard of it.

2189
02:17:28.651 --> 02:17:31.750
Nine Dash Oh yeah.
We called Ding Dong ditch and,

2190
02:17:32.130 --> 02:17:36.960
and when he told me his,
his Florida version,
I was like,
Nah,
dude,

2191
02:17:36.961 --> 02:17:40.910
I didn't hear that as a kid.
And then either a racist,

2192
02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:45.470
<v 11>by the way,
in the south,
that's not even,
I mean that's just,
that's like the,</v>

2193
02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:49.950
the Eh,
the m word was involved in anything when I was in like the live in that

2194
02:17:49.951 --> 02:17:53.070
neighborhood.
That was what it was called.
Everything.
Everything.

2195
02:17:53.130 --> 02:17:55.200
I mean it just was included in everything.

2196
02:17:55.540 --> 02:17:57.570
That's where it was like a joke around about political correctness.

2197
02:17:57.571 --> 02:18:01.440
I'm cool with the little bit of political correctness about changing,
you know,

2198
02:18:01.560 --> 02:18:02.191
if you just take,

2199
02:18:02.191 --> 02:18:04.710
cause I don't think there were people that didn't even know that that was

2200
02:18:04.711 --> 02:18:09.450
offensive,
you know?
I bet there's still people in the south,
the go out.
It's like,

2201
02:18:09.451 --> 02:18:13.680
what are we Brazil nuts.
Yeah.
You ever heard,
what are they,
what are they?
They,

2202
02:18:13.940 --> 02:18:15.840
I mean,
I'm just saying you could Google this online,

2203
02:18:15.841 --> 02:18:20.430
but it said they're called Edward Toes.
Oh yeah.
Then it's so funny.

2204
02:18:20.431 --> 02:18:21.390
One time we were at dinner with her

2205
02:18:21.430 --> 02:18:25.390
<v 0>really as a,
we were encyclopedia knowledge.
It's easy.</v>

2206
02:18:32.050 --> 02:18:34.370
<v 11>Tell us more.
You know,</v>

2207
02:18:34.430 --> 02:18:38.050
so funny as I was at dinner with someone and Leanna grew up in Georgia,

2208
02:18:38.051 --> 02:18:42.380
she knew this about this too,
but she must have,
she had like rural Georgia,
right?

2209
02:18:42.390 --> 02:18:46.330
Oh really?
Like 1200 people.
So she,
she was like,
I'm a,
when I met her,

2210
02:18:46.331 --> 02:18:49.150
I went down south.
People were using that word all the time,

2211
02:18:49.560 --> 02:18:54.190
still in like 2004 when I was dating.
Really?
Yeah.

2212
02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:54.820
Oh yeah.

2213
02:18:54.820 --> 02:18:59.820
And so I said Leland were at dinner one time with a couple from Kansas and they

2214
02:19:00.671 --> 02:19:04.550
had never heard that the m word would be associated with in,
in a phrase all g.

2215
02:19:04.800 --> 02:19:08.030
<v 0>Oh,
you said like,
like a verb or something.
Oh,
I get it now.
You mean like,</v>

2216
02:19:08.060 --> 02:19:08.893
like the Ding Dong?

2217
02:19:09.210 --> 02:19:13.200
<v 11>Yeah.
And so it will be replaced and tea and they'd never heard it.</v>

2218
02:19:13.201 --> 02:19:16.200
And I was like,
are you being serious?
And then I was like,
to Leanna,
I was like,

2219
02:19:16.201 --> 02:19:20.070
wait,
we grew up in the south but we weren't racist.
But what?

2220
02:19:20.071 --> 02:19:22.290
We definitely heard it,
you never heard it?
And they're like,
no.

2221
02:19:22.410 --> 02:19:24.480
So I go online on this guy's computer,

2222
02:19:24.600 --> 02:19:27.200
we're at their house and I Google it and I go,
here you go.

2223
02:19:27.440 --> 02:19:29.450
And I pull up this website and it's got all of them.

2224
02:19:29.510 --> 02:19:33.500
It's got them all listed and I'm reading through them and to the,

2225
02:19:33.501 --> 02:19:37.430
to him and he's like,
that seems like a little bit of a stretch.
And I go,
yeah,

2226
02:19:37.431 --> 02:19:39.290
I've never,
I go some of these I've never heard.

2227
02:19:39.291 --> 02:19:42.730
And then I look and it's official website of the Blue Klux Klan in the light.

2228
02:19:42.990 --> 02:19:46.480
I'm like,
Oh shit.
It hooks up to your web history.

2229
02:19:47.240 --> 02:19:52.160
It's like something to neo Nazi website,
but a god.
Yeah.

2230
02:19:52.220 --> 02:19:53.570
I don't know,
man.
Race was weird.

2231
02:19:53.571 --> 02:19:57.050
And Florida are you a black guy who loves the flood?

2232
02:19:57.160 --> 02:19:59.350
<v 2>Good Watch boot crushers.</v>

2233
02:19:59.351 --> 02:20:03.160
New Special secret time holding the undead plex.
No,

2234
02:20:03.161 --> 02:20:05.800

2235

That's all Jay.

I always thought I was Cuban,</v>

2237
02:20:17.850 --> 02:20:21.600
like always felt Cuban.
You thought you were Cuban?
Felt Cuban.

2238
02:20:21.900 --> 02:20:25.260
Like I remember going to Spain and being able to talk Spanish and then I just

2239
02:20:25.320 --> 02:20:27.570
tell people I was Cuban and they're like,
you're not fucking Cuban.
I was like,

2240
02:20:27.571 --> 02:20:28.770
Nah man.

2241
02:20:29.390 --> 02:20:32.930
<v 3>You know when you're part of me can you just Puerto Rican?
Yeah.
Oh boy.</v>

2242
02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:38.180
Why you still a clip your nails and then keep the clippings on a piece of scotch

2243
02:20:38.181 --> 02:20:41.750
tape?
He taped under the table.
I got to put it in different places now,
but yeah,

2244
02:20:41.810 --> 02:20:44.840
you still do that?
Yeah,
I remember that.
Crazy.
It's the old school.

2245
02:20:44.841 --> 02:20:49.340
It's also Nah nasty.
It is.
You are nasty.
I am.

2246
02:20:49.341 --> 02:20:49.891
I'm pretty gross.

2247
02:20:49.891 --> 02:20:54.350
And the kind of guy that your girls will think like this is like the cause girls

2248
02:20:54.351 --> 02:20:57.650
model there.
You know it's true.
They pursue usually after their dad.

2249
02:20:57.651 --> 02:20:59.180
It's going to be like a nastiest guy.

2250
02:20:59.300 --> 02:21:03.200
It's going to be a guy that comes out quite far in his hand be like Sup Bert.

2251
02:21:03.460 --> 02:21:06.150
<v 11>Oh my daughter.
I shit under the toilet seat.</v>

2252
02:21:06.290 --> 02:21:08.190
<v 3>Ah,
how do you do that?
How does that happen?</v>

2253
02:21:08.260 --> 02:21:10.210
<v 11>Do you ever,
do you ever shit,
yeah,</v>

2254
02:21:10.300 --> 02:21:13.180
I was saying this on stage the other day and I didn't realize that no one does

2255
02:21:13.181 --> 02:21:17.800
this.
Do you ever shit.
And then it splashes up and hits up under the toilet seat.

2256
02:21:17.870 --> 02:21:21.010
<v 3>No,
I've seen it though.
After his dad visited over dies.</v>

2257
02:21:22.940 --> 02:21:23.930
Oh my God.

2258
02:21:27.620 --> 02:21:28.540
Someone said this was you.

2259
02:21:29.960 --> 02:21:33.110
<v 11>No,
I shouldn't the ocean though.
One time like this,
you know,
I took a shower,</v>

2260
02:21:33.111 --> 02:21:33.680
I took a,
Oh,

2261
02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:36.850
we were at a Catalina and we were to a secluded beach and I thought it,

2262
02:21:36.851 --> 02:21:39.190
no one was there.
And I went out and I threw his shit in the ocean.
Yeah.

2263
02:21:39.280 --> 02:21:40.990
Nobody was watching and I shit.

2264
02:21:40.991 --> 02:21:43.610
And we used to do it all the time at Florida and I shouldn't the ocean.

2265
02:21:43.820 --> 02:21:48.820
And then I got out and I could see it floating around and all of a sudden a

2266
02:21:48.951 --> 02:21:49.790
group of people,

2267
02:21:49.791 --> 02:21:53.720
like 10 people that we don't know come down to the beach and my Turd is floating

2268
02:21:53.721 --> 02:21:56.210
in the water in the waves and they're in the water.

2269
02:21:56.211 --> 02:21:59.660
And I see my turd going towards them.
I'm like,
I'm like thinking,
oh my God,

2270
02:21:59.661 --> 02:22:02.000
this is,
there's no way of getting evidence.
They're going to know that.

2271
02:22:02.001 --> 02:22:05.210
That's my shit.
Like you can't go,
oh,
it's a fish.
Yeah.

2272
02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:10.070
<v 3>Oh,
you are nasty.
Do you still not wear underwear under your jeans?</v>

2273
02:22:10.310 --> 02:22:13.040
Dude?
How does that,
it's gonna really shake your,
love it dick and balls.

2274
02:22:13.370 --> 02:22:17.900
<v 11>No,
you're,
you're dick gets numb to it.
I my Dick's or a farm?
Yeah.</v>

2275
02:22:18.200 --> 02:22:21.080
Yeah.
You're like,
I would pick the smallest finger.

2276
02:22:21.430 --> 02:22:26.070
<v 3>Yeah.
What about your boogers?
I remember you're,
you're,
I'm,
I am</v>

2277
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:29.970
<v 9>a vigorous nose picker as well.
Leanne was saying that you are like,</v>

2278
02:22:29.980 --> 02:22:31.380
you really aggressive with it too.

2279
02:22:31.381 --> 02:22:35.970
When you'd roll it and then leave it in the furniture or you'd rub it on staff

2280
02:22:36.330 --> 02:22:38.970
<v 0>flicker,
flicker.
I,
you know what,
in my mind,
I could be totally wrong.</v>

2281
02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:43.350
I imagine is probably a real good nose picker.
No,
no,

2282
02:22:44.180 --> 02:22:48.590
<v 9>no.
I was,
no,
neither.
No,
they're both,
the girls were kind of tame.</v>

2283
02:22:49.070 --> 02:22:53.540
I would thought,
I would have thought that Iowa had like a real strong game.
No,

2284
02:22:53.750 --> 02:22:58.520
no,
no.
She does it.
She's,
she's not as dirty as you'd think.

2285
02:22:58.521 --> 02:23:01.010
They both shit at the same time during the day.

2286
02:23:01.190 --> 02:23:04.850
They both should have four in the afternoon.
Oh,
it's just weird that they would,

2287
02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:07.730
they won't shit anywhere other than their house.

2288
02:23:07.731 --> 02:23:10.790
They don't like shitting anywhere else.
I love shooting in strange places.

2289
02:23:11.240 --> 02:23:13.850
It doesn't bother me either.
Maybe because we travel so much.

2290
02:23:13.851 --> 02:23:17.450
She kind of has love shooting and like a burger king.
You do?
Oh,

2291
02:23:18.170 --> 02:23:20.690
I love shitting in a strange place.
I do really embrace.

2292
02:23:20.691 --> 02:23:25.020
I love having to take your shit and take it and I like you.
Shit.

2293
02:23:25.040 --> 02:23:28.490
How many times a day have you been going lately?
Three.
You push when you shit

2294
02:23:28.580 --> 02:23:31.540
<v 0>now.
Now it's just like I got to go.
Everything's like,
I got it.</v>

2295
02:23:31.780 --> 02:23:35.510
It's not like disaster shifts.
I'm saying their normal shifts,
but I,
I,

2296
02:23:36.020 --> 02:23:38.090
I don't wait.
Like I'll just sit.
It's like,

2297
02:23:38.120 --> 02:23:40.430
it's telling me it's time to go and it's,
it's pretty quick.

2298
02:23:40.920 --> 02:23:44.520
<v 9>Yeah.
How are you liking the washlet?
I saw you guys had that.
Oh my God,</v>

2299
02:23:45.140 --> 02:23:48.480
I wish they would be a sponsor to the podcast has changed my life.

2300
02:23:48.990 --> 02:23:50.790
I don't have hemorrhoids anymore because of it,

2301
02:23:51.120 --> 02:23:52.530
because it just sprays her asshole.

2302
02:23:52.680 --> 02:23:55.230
I remember the first time I ever had those in Japan.

2303
02:23:55.920 --> 02:23:59.190
That was when I first ever used one of those ones in Japan.
I loved it.

2304
02:23:59.340 --> 02:24:02.100
I took a shit so bad in Japan.
This guy next to me threw up one time,

2305
02:24:08.950 --> 02:24:12.740
<v 11>no public restroom,
and he threw up next to me.
I heard him throwing up.</v>

2306
02:24:16.030 --> 02:24:20.120
It was so bad.
That's happened twice to me that one time it happened in Denver.

2307
02:24:20.270 --> 02:24:23.840
I took a shit and the guy next to me goes,
oh my God.
He was like,
Dear God,

2308
02:24:23.850 --> 02:24:26.840
is that you?
And he started gagging and I go,
it's pretty bad.
Right?

2309
02:24:26.841 --> 02:24:30.340
And he was like,
when I was like,
are you throwing up?
He's like,
I can't,

2310
02:24:30.800 --> 02:24:31.700
I gotta get Outta here.

2311
02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:35.480
<v 0>Did I remember in high school we did a,
uh,
like a class trip,</v>

2312
02:24:36.070 --> 02:24:39.220
overnight trip where you go and you spend the night in the woods somewhere.

2313
02:24:39.430 --> 02:24:42.760
And we were a junior in high school and it was the morning.
And I go and I,

2314
02:24:42.761 --> 02:24:44.410
you know,
when you feel the gurgles you're like,

2315
02:24:44.411 --> 02:24:47.860
this can be a nasty ones going be loud.
So I walk in,

2316
02:24:48.350 --> 02:24:51.170
I'm going towards the stall and I see cliff,
my,

2317
02:24:51.340 --> 02:24:56.070
one of my classmates and he's like,
what's up man?
I do that.
I'll go,
hey.
And um,

2318
02:24:56.470 --> 02:24:57.790
I sit down and I'm like,

2319
02:24:57.791 --> 02:25:00.400
I'm going to wait for him to get comfortable because I know how bad this is

2320
02:25:00.401 --> 02:25:02.890
going to be and I want them to be locked into it,
you know?

2321
02:25:03.280 --> 02:25:07.270
But my asshole's also like,
you got to shit bad.
So I just,

2322
02:25:07.271 --> 02:25:09.220
I hold as long as I can and he just,

2323
02:25:09.221 --> 02:25:13.690
I see him drop his pants and he's in the stall next door and then I release and

2324
02:25:13.691 --> 02:25:14.524
it just goes right.

2325
02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:17.400
<v 9>Huge explosion.</v>

2326
02:25:17.730 --> 02:25:22.620
And within a second I just hear him go fuck this and pull his pants up.

2327
02:25:22.890 --> 02:25:24.550
I think he had a turd hanging out of his ass.

2328
02:25:24.750 --> 02:25:26.290
Just pulls his pants up and leaves because,

2329
02:25:26.291 --> 02:25:30.640
and I just start laughing so hard because I know how bad it sounds and I know

2330
02:25:30.641 --> 02:25:31.480
how bad it smells.

2331
02:25:31.720 --> 02:25:35.560
He left the bathroom is still like one of my greatest high school memories.
Yes.

2332
02:25:35.590 --> 02:25:35.960
Nice.

2333
02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:40.130
<v 11>I was just telling someone the worst I've ever,
shit my pants was um,</v>

2334
02:25:40.310 --> 02:25:43.040
tennis camp.
I went to a,

2335
02:25:43.340 --> 02:25:47.030
I was playing this Indian kid and I had to shit really bad and I was like,

2336
02:25:47.060 --> 02:25:48.350
oh my God.
So I just threw the set,

2337
02:25:48.351 --> 02:25:52.430
like our last ran the men's locker room and as soon as I went to go get there,

2338
02:25:52.580 --> 02:25:57.050
it was already kind of coming out and I shit inside my pants,

2339
02:25:57.080 --> 02:26:01.620
inside my underwear,
on the tail of my shirt and in my thoughts.
And I,

2340
02:26:01.700 --> 02:26:03.410
and I sat in it.
I like I shit.

2341
02:26:03.411 --> 02:26:07.100
And I sat in it and I had to get rid of all my clothes.

2342
02:26:07.220 --> 02:26:11.720
I had to break into a man's locker and get clothes to wear because I didn't have

2343
02:26:11.750 --> 02:26:13.430
any,
they were all covered in shit

2344
02:26:14.210 --> 02:26:16.290
<v 9>to what is wrong with you guys?
Like,
don't you know how,</v>

2345
02:26:16.291 --> 02:26:19.140
how much are you shitting now?
No.
Don't you know when you have to shit,

2346
02:26:19.141 --> 02:26:22.200
why are you,
why are you waiting until you shitting on Sundays?

2347
02:26:22.260 --> 02:26:26.760
Because I travel so I forget to shit on Sundays and Mondays are bad.

2348
02:26:26.761 --> 02:26:30.900
Today was fucking aggressive.
You should do shit more than once a day.
No,

2349
02:26:31.050 --> 02:26:32.910
usually once it once,
just once a day.
If I do,

2350
02:26:33.090 --> 02:26:36.480
if I eat spicy food I'll shit at night and then I won't shift the next day.

2351
02:26:36.660 --> 02:26:40.200
What about like in a normal non spicy shit in the morning or no?

2352
02:26:40.570 --> 02:26:44.260
<v 11>Yeah,
I shit in the morning I've drink a big glass water and I just shit.
But I,</v>

2353
02:26:44.300 --> 02:26:48.830
I have my shit's come out like,
like fucking like shotguns,
like,

2354
02:26:51.180 --> 02:26:53.860
<v 9>like it's almost comes out all at once just,
and I'm,</v>

2355
02:26:54.160 --> 02:26:56.980
I get it to the point where it's like,
okay,
we're building,
we're building,

2356
02:26:56.981 --> 02:27:00.220
we're building and then write physicals.
Yeah.
And everything's good with,

2357
02:27:00.221 --> 02:27:04.870
you know,
blood,
everything.
But my,
my,
my thyroid's a little fucked up.

2358
02:27:04.871 --> 02:27:06.280
I think your thyroid is,
yeah.

2359
02:27:06.290 --> 02:27:10.620
I think I have like an over actor or an inactive thyroid or inactive.

2360
02:27:10.630 --> 02:27:14.740
I'm guessing he said it's trashed.
Trashed.
Yeah.

2361
02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:18.280
But everything else with you is fine.
Yeah.
That's great.
When the crazy,
yeah.

2362
02:27:18.620 --> 02:27:22.540
Cause you don't like,
it's not that you look terrible or anything.

2363
02:27:23.710 --> 02:27:27.190
No,
I'm saying you don't,
but it's like knowing how you,

2364
02:27:27.310 --> 02:27:32.200
how you fucking drive.
It's like,
oh yeah.
It's Kinda crazy.
Yeah.

2365
02:27:32.201 --> 02:27:36.340
I uh,
I don't know.
I I,
I mean I,
yeah,
I don't know.

2366
02:27:36.430 --> 02:27:39.170
I think it was Mickey Mantle Gene.
That's Mackey manager.
Here's the clip.

2367
02:27:40.820 --> 02:27:44.180
<v 14>This is how bad of a parent I am.
This is true.</v>

2368
02:27:44.270 --> 02:27:47.300
I went to a parent teacher conference,
stayed out until four in the morning.

2369
02:27:47.690 --> 02:27:51.960
Conference starts at seven 30 in the morning.
I wake up my golf.
Fuck I,

2370
02:27:52.010 --> 02:27:54.440
I make a cup of coffee.
I grabbed two diet cokes,

2371
02:27:54.740 --> 02:27:57.190
go to the parent teacher conference killer coffee before the conference theme.

2372
02:27:57.191 --> 02:28:00.410
It starts sit down to the conference,
crack my diet coke,

2373
02:28:00.411 --> 02:28:03.170
take a sip and realize I have a corps light.

2374
02:28:04.570 --> 02:28:05.403
<v 5>It's true.</v>

2375
02:28:10.980 --> 02:28:12.930
<v 14>That is a game time decision,
gentlemen.</v>

2376
02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:18.390
The second I felt the beer touch my tongue.
Oh,

2377
02:28:18.810 --> 02:28:20.550
that's like a finger in your ass.
In an orgy.

2378
02:28:23.090 --> 02:28:26.600
What kind of man are you?
Do you pull away from it or do you push back into it?

2379
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:32.150
Yeah.
I pushed back into it,
not kill that fucking chorus light,

2380
02:28:42.530 --> 02:28:43.610
reach into my pocket and prayed.

2381
02:28:43.611 --> 02:28:47.120
I don't know the core like who the fuck wants a diet coke?

2382
02:28:47.121 --> 02:28:48.350
Have you just had a chorus line?

2383
02:28:50.650 --> 02:28:52.720
<v 11>That's a true story.
That's funny.</v>

2384
02:28:52.721 --> 02:28:57.721
You drew it's 100% true and you drank it and I cracked it and I to take a sip.

2385
02:28:57.940 --> 02:29:01.670
Yeah.
I'm like,
come on.
No,
no,
no one knew.
They didn't know.
No one knew.

2386
02:29:01.671 --> 02:29:05.620
I as soon as the beer tasted,
the bureau went,
oh my God,
I have a fucking beer.

2387
02:29:05.640 --> 02:29:06.640
Like I didn't realize how had a beer.

2388
02:29:06.641 --> 02:29:09.400
I thought it was a good diet coke and I just had to murder it cause I couldn't

2389
02:29:09.401 --> 02:29:10.900
like take a sip and and put it on the counter.

2390
02:29:11.140 --> 02:29:13.420
I just had to kill it and then put it in my pocket.

2391
02:29:13.880 --> 02:29:17.360
<v 0>By the way,
I want you,
I want to point out that when you shot this special,</v>

2392
02:29:17.361 --> 02:29:18.650
I remember you calling me like Tommy,

2393
02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:20.870
you wouldn't believe how skinny I am right now

2394
02:29:21.690 --> 02:29:25.590

2397
02:29:35.351 --> 02:29:36.830

if I just,

2398
02:29:37.030 --> 02:29:40.570
can we make a documentary about you gaining it back though,
if you hit two.
Okay.

2399
02:29:40.630 --> 02:29:44.520
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And like,
I want you to go crazy.
Yeah.

2400
02:29:44.720 --> 02:29:48.470
We're the fucking throw it all back on.
Just wait.
So wait,

2401
02:29:48.520 --> 02:29:51.880
when you shit in Japan,
you just smelled that.
You're like,
oh,
I mean,

2402
02:29:52.090 --> 02:29:53.840
you hear a guy in the next,

2403
02:29:55.660 --> 02:29:56.950
<v 11>I thought he was talking to me.
Yeah.</v>

2404
02:30:01.450 --> 02:30:05.800
Yeah.
It was fucking bad.
It was really bad.

2405
02:30:06.180 --> 02:30:09.120
<v 0>Uh,
man,
I remember that.
Uh,
there was,
um,</v>

2406
02:30:09.390 --> 02:30:13.500
there was a guy who came to his show once with this girl and he was like,

2407
02:30:13.710 --> 02:30:18.330
we were talking about farts and he's like,
she farted still so bad in the car.

2408
02:30:18.480 --> 02:30:22.350
Then I puked in the car,
play about his girl's heart.
I was like,

2409
02:30:23.380 --> 02:30:26.730
oh.
I hung my head out the window through,

2410
02:30:27.870 --> 02:30:28.703
Oh my God.

2411
02:30:28.730 --> 02:30:33.020
<v 11>Oh my God.
We,
uh,
we,</v>

2412
02:30:33.021 --> 02:30:37.940
one time my mom,
me and my mom,
my me,
the both girls.

2413
02:30:37.941 --> 02:30:40.400
Leanne,
my mom and my dad are in San Francisco.

2414
02:30:40.401 --> 02:30:43.820
We're going across now is it the golden gate bridge that has two stories to it?

2415
02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:48.440
No,
it's the other one is it that we're going over that bridge and money bridge?

2416
02:30:48.500 --> 02:30:50.930
The Bay Bridge and my mom is,

2417
02:30:51.200 --> 02:30:54.890
we had been at an amusement park over shooting birth conqueror and my mom is

2418
02:30:54.891 --> 02:30:57.260
motion sick.
She goes,
oh my God,
I think I'm gonna throw up.

2419
02:30:57.560 --> 02:31:01.130
I think I'm gonna throw up.
Love these PC sitting next.
She's sitting next to me.

2420
02:31:01.131 --> 02:31:04.670
I don't want to hear this.
And she takes the clear bag,

2421
02:31:04.671 --> 02:31:09.671
they put the pictures in and she grows up in a clear bag and I see it and I

2422
02:31:10.581 --> 02:31:12.080
start drinking,
got dry heaving.

2423
02:31:12.081 --> 02:31:16.420
I start going and I stick my head out the window and I'm throwing up.

2424
02:31:16.421 --> 02:31:19.790
I'm going to throw it right now after I go out the window,
Ma,
my,

2425
02:31:20.280 --> 02:31:24.830
<v 9>everyone in the car is dry.
I got to go.
This has been a really good,</v>

2426
02:31:25.610 --> 02:31:27.510
I got it.
Yeah.
Well,
we're going to throw up.

2427
02:31:29.310 --> 02:31:30.480
<v 12>Oh,
wow.</v>

2428
02:31:35.590 --> 02:31:36.460
<v 9>Oh,</v>

2429
02:31:37.980 --> 02:31:42.100
<v 0>oh,
she doesn't,
she can't deal with throw throwing stories at all.
No.
Oh,</v>

2430
02:31:42.101 --> 02:31:46.540
I can't even think about throwing up.
I play them just to upset her sometimes.

2431
02:31:46.570 --> 02:31:51.430
For Real.
Yeah.
Isn't there one from last week?
I feel like there was.
Oh.

2432
02:31:51.780 --> 02:31:56.370
Oh my God.
That made me laugh.
Um,
where was it?
Yeah,

2433
02:31:56.380 --> 02:31:59.530
last week there was,
oh,
here it is.
Yeah.

2434
02:31:59.560 --> 02:32:01.420
I played this last week just to piss her off.

2435
02:32:11.020 --> 02:32:12.430
<v 12>Oh my God.
I can't watch.
I'm going to throw up.</v>

2436
02:32:17.090 --> 02:32:21.040
I'm going to throw it
for real now.

2437
02:32:29.940 --> 02:32:33.200
<v 0>Is it really fuck with you?
Oh my God.
Y'All throw up.
Really?
Oh yeah.</v>

2438
02:32:33.201 --> 02:32:38.060
Just even looking at it.
Oh my God.
I'm going to throw up.
Don't,

2439
02:32:38.061 --> 02:32:41.060
don't fucking throw up,

Oh.

2440
02:32:42.410 --> 02:32:43.460
<v 12>Oh my God.
Oh my God.</v>

2441
02:32:50.510 --> 02:32:55.310
<v 0>God.
Oh my God.
All right.
Um,

I'm so proud of you.</v>

2442

I'm so happy for you.
Uh,

2444
02:33:02.600 --> 02:33:05.150
Thank you,

You guys check it out.
It is a,

2445

2446

Here's our closing song.
It's called lick the ass.
Lick the bowl.

2449
02:33:21.370 --> 02:33:21.660
<v 12>Okay.</v>

Bye.
[inaudible] on the street.</v>

2452
02:33:31.410 --> 02:33:33.020
Good.
Someone put a beat to that.

2453
02:33:38.030 --> 02:33:42.760
We never had that.
Never had,
we never had that.

2454
02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:46.390
We were going to a good one.
That bag on the guy.
He never had,

2455
02:33:49.180 --> 02:33:50.340
never had that.

2456
02:33:59.160 --> 02:34:01.620
We never had there

2457
02:34:08.870 --> 02:34:10.720
as like a ball

2458
02:34:14.770 --> 02:34:15.520
