29
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.350
next week I actually have another show that announces that launches.

30
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.140
Until then,
there are a few things I need to point out.

31
00:02:03.141 --> 00:02:07.010
Let's see.
New Orleans is all sold out.
Um,

32
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.290
a few tickets left in the Boise second show.
I would get it if you want to go.

33
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.430
Sacramento is definitely not going to last.
Fresno,
Bakersfield,

34
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.620
Fort Myers,
Florida.
That's the southwest part of Florida.
Uh,

35
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:23.270
that's the only place I'm going in that area.

36
00:02:23.271 --> 00:02:27.300
Next year I'll be going back to Tampa and whatnot,
but not this year.
Uh,

37
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.780
Jack me off.
Phil is moving along.

38
00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:34.220
We have a second show added the first show sold out in Orlando and there are

39
00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:38.420

40
00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:41.780

41
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.140
<v 2>to the tour page.
Uh,</v>

42
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.930
Jean tour tour tour.
Do you say tour tour?

43
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.460
I don't say tour tour.
Tour,
tour.
I said that wrong.
No,
I don't think so.

44
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:57.780
Someone I heard go the tour tour when you were thinking of joining our tour.

45
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.010
I'm going on tour.
Not sure.
I

46
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.280
<v 3>think it's where people say tournament at a tournament and there was a</v>

47
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.133
tournament,

48
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.440
I say tournament tournament and I say that to torque tournament.

49
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.280
Yeah.
All guys.

50
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.260
Is there another uh,
show doing announcer?
No.
No.
Oh,
okay.

51
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.840
To San Diego.

52
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.500
But what I'm doing San Diego the weekend of thanksgiving.
Okay.
Uh,

53
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:24.460
the House of Blues.

54
00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:27.880
So if you want to get away from your family or bring your family to the show,

55
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.720
get those tickets.
Also Christine,
great to get out of the House that weekend.

56
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.790
Yeah,
I think by Saturday you're kind of over it and board and um,

57
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.390
it seemed like a good time to do a show.

58
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.910
<v 0>Thank you to Dylan for sending in that instrumental.</v>

59
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:43.420
You can always get your instrumentals or songs considered for play by sending

60
00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:46.720
them to your mom's podcast@gmail.com.

61
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:48.610
There's no house in the address,

62
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:52.870
it's just your mom's podcast at g mail.
What's up Jean?

63
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.510
All right.
Well there's a lot to cover,
gene.
We've got to get into this shape.

64
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.700
Big Show,
big show today.
All kinds of things going on.

65
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.590
Are you ready to get moving?
I'm ready.
I'm ready.
Let's,
let's party.
Let's do it.

66
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.520
<v 4>I'm a dirty fan on a ship.
Pig.</v>

67
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.343
I'm a tall

68
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.090
guy.
You don't want to station degradation?

69
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.930
<v 3>There's one for Dr drew right there.</v>

70
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.740
What happened to hear a man?

71
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.560
Oh Man.

72
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.650
<v 0>Hmm hmm.
Our soundboard just died.
Oh,
you're kidding.</v>

73
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.010
Well,
it didn't play.
That was weird.
I mean,

74
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.020
just admiring this guy's bottom row of teeth are so white is nice teeth.
Well,

75
00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:48.890
I don't know if they're nice.

76
00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.100
<v 1>Well,
go to your mom's house.</v>

77
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.940
<v 3>That's an intense way to start off this guy.
Well,</v>

78
00:05:11.941 --> 00:05:16.080
first of all,
let's give him credit.
He knows if he wants to get on this show.

79
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.520
Be Shirtless.
Yeah.

80
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.610
A frame it up at at uncomfortably close way or just in an unflattering way.

81
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.270
Yeah,
I just noticed the shirtless.
Why always shirtless with these guys.

82
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.220
Agassi in his nostrils.
I mean,
it is.
I always find it kind of odd.

83
00:05:32.221 --> 00:05:36.120
The guys are shirtless in public,
like jogging.
I mean,
that's kind of weird.

84
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.260
<v 0>Before we continue on this,
I always forget,
you know,
I wrote this down.
I try,</v>

85
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.480
I forget these things that we are now,
um,

86
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.370
blue band just told me the shows are going to be there.
We're on twitch now.

87
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.870
You know,
people can check it out and read titting that.
Yeah,
you can read Ted it,

88
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.300
but here's the thing we're going to start doing on twitch.

89
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.040
The episodes are going to start playing on

90
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.990
<v 3>twitch two hours before youtube drops out of town.
You can chat,
you know,</v>

91
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:07.250
you can go along with whatever you want to do and get involved.
Uh,

92
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.470
if you want to try it out,

93
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.400
twitch.tv/your mom's house podcast every Tuesday around 9:00 PM,

94
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.750
that's two hours before the Youtube episode comes out.
Um,
you know,

95
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.150
try it out.
There you go.
That's awesome.
Yeah,

96
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.050
and you get to watch with other viewers.
Is that,
that's how that works.

97
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.710
I'm to try to jump in on one of these two.
Maybe I won't.
She'll see there,

98
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.420
see there and try on myself.
Uh,
yeah,
I'll let you hear this again.
It's a,

99
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.020
it's quite alarming.
Starts off well,
the alarming bit too,

100
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.070
now that I think about it,
it's just doing any sort of video.

101
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.540
Shirtless is preposterous.
That's the least preposterous.

102
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.100
This video.
Right,
but I'm saying like how many shirtless videos have you done?

103
00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.230
Like 0.0 that's done a few.
I have done if we've done the tried out guy,

104
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:05.210
I've done that.
I did.
I burned shaving me 10 years ago.
It's a long time ago.
No,

105
00:07:05.211 --> 00:07:08.840
I don't make a regular habit of it for sure.
Yeah.
I mean,
oddly enough,

106
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.920
you know who does nothing but shirtless stuff is Bert.
Oh I know.

107
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:17.140
And then so do these people that are troubled mentally ill and then burn drugs.

108
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.100
Lots of drugs.
Yeah.
Let's hear this again.
I got to,

109
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.650
this was really something that'll absorb it.
Yeah.

110
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:29.000
<v 4>I'm going to do a defense.
I'm a shape pig.</v>

111
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.690
Dehumanization,
teas.

112
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.090
<v 3>Let me do doctor Joe.
Oh,
the trauma.
Oh yeah,
this isn't good.</v>

113
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.050
It's a trauma.
Check him out.
He's like,
if you see me in the streets,

114
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:52.490
<v 4>if you see me walking on the street,
shout hey shit bake.</v>

115
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.380
And then we'll come to you after the train show piece it shit.

116
00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.320
Enjoy your verbal mediation is over me.

117
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.710
You can shit off of me.
You can show your friends what a dirty,

118
00:08:06.711 --> 00:08:09.320
disgusting,
fat that I really am.

119
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.760
<v 3>Well,
no,
I mean everybody knows we're not saying the f word anymore.
Yeah.</v>

120
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:18.000
I feel like I'm a little like,
I don't like his insensitivity.

121
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.170
It's very insensitive.

122
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.250
I also would say that maybe he gets a pass because he's saying it about himself.

123
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.760
He'll,
he has a pass.
Yeah.
Well it gets,
this is a lot going on here.

124
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:30.963
I mean,
I don't know.

125
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:34.350
I'm sure a lot of people would take him up on the software to call him and shit.

126
00:08:34.351 --> 00:08:36.300
Peg.
I don't know.
Some would for sure.
Yeah,

127
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.390
<v 4>it does show your friends what a dirty,
disgusting,</v>

128
00:08:40.391 --> 00:08:41.960
fat that I really am.

129
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.420
<v 3>Right,
right.
Well,
he is.
He always loved of the picture.
Yes.</v>

130
00:08:46.421 --> 00:08:51.340
We did this as it took us happen.
Von Swank took this one year ago.

131
00:08:51.341 --> 00:08:54.190
Maybe I was giving you a sip of that coffee and you almost want them.

132
00:08:54.191 --> 00:08:58.350
I didn't taste like shit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Really cute.
You look really cute.

133
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.980
I can't wait to look like a person again.
This is very exciting.
What a,
Hey,

134
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.780
are you pregnant?
I'm just full.
Every week somebody will message me like,

135
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.260
Hey,
uh,
what's up with Christina?
So it's bigger.
It's the same.

136
00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:16.710
You have the baby.
Oh,
she's pregnant.
Hey Dummies.
Yeah,
come on.
Don't be,
yeah.

137
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:23.100
Um,
yeah.
I'm,
I'm,
we have four weeks ago,
I'm in the final countdown.
Yeah.

138
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.990
Which is crazy.
And they kind of went by really fast,
didn't it?
I mean,

139
00:09:27.991 --> 00:09:30.750
for me it did went by fast.

140
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.620
It did in places you've been pregnant for like eight years.
Right now.
I know.

141
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.920
Well now it's going slow.
This is the,
the most torturous part of it.

142
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.650
I like to think that when we were in have vat,
the,
yeah.

143
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:45.690
A year ago you were pregnant
or January.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

144
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.310
And you are already in your pregnancy then.
I know.
It's crazy.
It lasts so long.

145
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.130
It's just too long.
It's too home.
But then,
uh,
you know,

146
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.280
I'll squeeze this pupperoni out.
This little thugs.

147
00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:59.970
I cut it all over again in a few weeks.
So fucking,

148
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.070
how many weeks are we going to skip of the podcast?
Really?

149
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.200
What are you talking about?
We can't skip weeks.
Oh,

150
00:10:07.201 --> 00:10:11.040
I'm asking you because you're the lady having the baby.
No,
we can't skip.

151
00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:15.480
This is important.
I love doing the show without a show.
That's crazy.
So you'll,

152
00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:18.960
you'll,
you'll still managed to come in here and do it even like,
well,

153
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.570
as I'm giving birth,
we can do a podcast there.

154
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:27.480
As I'm feeding him the first night we can do show there.
Okay.

155
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.490
What do you think?
Yeah,
I mean,
I think we got to try to bank one that least,

156
00:10:32.491 --> 00:10:37.440
right?
At least one.
No,
we are guys,
don't make these listeners panic.
I mean,

157
00:10:37.441 --> 00:10:40.710
I'm not trying to make them panic.
I'm trying to be sensitive to you.
We have,

158
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:45.060
we have,
we have none banked.
Not right now,
but we will.
Okay.

159
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:51.060
Okay.
Wheezy.
We'll get it gone.
Okay.
We gotta do it,
man.

160
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:54.870
Got to try it out.
Um,
yeah,
this guy here

161
00:10:55.770 --> 00:11:00.770
<v 4>sent me a text message and I might need you at subway station off within five</v>

162
00:11:02.581 --> 00:11:05.100
minutes.
Oh my goodness.
Can Be abused.

163
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:09.680
To be laughed at to be raped and mediated off.

164
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:10.980
Visit me at my place.

165
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:18.540
<v 3>You're welcome.
He wasn't mean or the train station.
Yeah.
I think he's in Norway.</v>

166
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.350
Oh my gosh.
What were in the train station he's gonna do in the bathroom.

167
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:27.380
Well I guess you can just,
you see him get off the train,
you can go hey shit bag.

168
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.970
And he'll be like,
oh that's me.
That's me.
Then you got like,

169
00:11:29.971 --> 00:11:32.700
I gotta take a Piss and maybe you just,

170
00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:37.650
I mean I think the thing would to do would be to like go into the men's room.

171
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:40.460
Usually manage room,
have multiple urinals.
Yeah.

172
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:45.120
And he plays him next to one and you just piss in his mouth and get the whole

173
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.850
Party started with,
which is kind of what he wants,
I think.

174
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.860
I Dunno man.
This one's real dark.
It's really,
really crazy.
Yeah.

175
00:11:53.861 --> 00:11:58.720
He's got problems you think?
I think so kind of problems.
Oh,
the trauma.

176
00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:02.970
So he's recreating trauma probably e it's a lot.
Yeah.

177
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:06.820
You probably don't get that way from having a great childhood,
I'm guessing.
Yeah.

178
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.120
Speaking of trauma.
Uh,

179
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.250
it's been really neat cause you've been into a brand new series on Netflix.

180
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:16.560
<v 0>Oh my God,
it's so great.
Anyway,</v>

181
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:21.210
I am so into the staircase,

182
00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.190
that's what it's called.
Yeah.

183
00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.060
It's like fucking amazing.

184
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:32.510
<v 3>Well it's been really great for my life and for my falling asleep times because</v>

185
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.760
now all I fall asleep to our episodes of this show and it's like an panics nine

186
00:12:38.731 --> 00:12:42.360
one one call is like the first episode where it's like nine one,
one,

187
00:12:42.361 --> 00:12:45.090
what's your emergency?
And he's like,
my wife.
Wow.

188
00:12:45.091 --> 00:12:49.520
I fell down the stairs and I'm like,
what are you listening to?

189
00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:53.780
<v 0>It's a lot.
It's a lot.
Yeah.
It's a lot you guys.</v>

190
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:01.140
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

191
00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:05.490
This is why I fall asleep to every night is nine one one calls and you're just

192
00:13:05.491 --> 00:13:07.980
ear to ear.
I'm looking over at you when you,
you can't even,

193
00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:11.700
you're so excited about these horrifying calls.

194
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.280
<v 0>Yeah.
It's,
um,</v>

195
00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:18.920
<v 3>what part do you like best about a nine one one call?
Like a panicked person?</v>

196
00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.150
<v 0>No,
I mean I was watching this,
uh,
the staircase is what it's called.</v>

197
00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:27.250
It is fucking unbelievable.
It's basically,
you know what,

198
00:13:27.251 --> 00:13:32.030
it's exactly like if you ever watch dateline or one of those,
um,
you know,

199
00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:37.030
48 hour mysteries,
it's,
it's an extended,
um,

200
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:41.670
version of that is extended version of that.
And so

201
00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:46.100
<v 3>be one episode is what,
12 or 13?
Yeah.</v>

202
00:13:46.101 --> 00:13:47.860
So you really get to go in depth on it.

203
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:51.880
<v 0>Well your follow a whole trial,
you follow an entire,
ah,</v>

204
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.890
I don't know how these,
these producers got this type of access to uh,

205
00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.730
to something like this.
It's really like I've never seen anything like it.

206
00:13:59.731 --> 00:14:01.570
I mean they're in the prosecutor,

207
00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:06.030
the DA's office there with the defense attorneys.
It's um,

208
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:11.130
it's a lot.
It's a lot.
They get really involved and then you,

209
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:16.850
you also follow the guy who is on bail home.

210
00:14:17.731 --> 00:14:22.260
You see him at home,
you know,
you want to be doing at home,

211
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.130
hanging out,
having dinner with his family.

212
00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:30.100
It's really one of the things like I didn't kill anybody.
Everything's normal.

213
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.670
Okay.
I don't want to give away this entire thing,

214
00:14:32.671 --> 00:14:37.671
but there's one thing that I have to tell you is like this is the premise for

215
00:14:39.031 --> 00:14:43.590
the whole thing.
So I'm really not,
I'm saying much by,
by,

216
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:47.650
by telling you this.
Try if I can pull up,
uh,

217
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:53.420
episode one here.
So
on the,

218
00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:59.620
on the,
the way that it starts is that this,

219
00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:03.160
this guy calls nine one one,

220
00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:07.180
which is what you were hearing was that first time.
Let me tell you,

221
00:15:07.181 --> 00:15:09.700
this is how this started.
So,
so horrible.

222
00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.190
Our routine basically at night is that Christina,

223
00:15:12.191 --> 00:15:14.170
and this is whether or not she's pregnant.

224
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.290
She always goes to bed before me and she likes,

225
00:15:17.291 --> 00:15:21.010
it's like the perfect marriage because I'm the type of person that if I'm going

226
00:15:21.011 --> 00:15:24.610
to bed first,
which is once a year,
never.
Yeah,

227
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:29.590
I don't like to hear noise.
Yeah.
I like,
I have to have a quiet room.

228
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:30.860
Maybe I can hear that.
Yeah.

229
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:35.150
<v 3>And dark.
It's gotta be Pitch Black,
pitch black.
It'd be really,</v>

230
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:39.320
I like white noise.
Like an air conditioning vent or a fan.
You love a fan on you.

231
00:15:39.321 --> 00:15:42.170
Which to me,
I hate,
cause a fan actually blows on me.

232
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:43.820
But we don't have a fan in there now.
No,
I know,

233
00:15:43.821 --> 00:15:48.040
but it makes me feel like you have a fever.
It's really noisy.
Right?

234
00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:52.010
I like that noise.
Any other noise and if you're watching TV,
I can't sleep right.

235
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:56.060
You on the other hand cans that you prefer to hear.
I like to hear you.

236
00:15:56.061 --> 00:15:59.390
I like the sound of a television when I fall asleep.
It's very comforting for me.

237
00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:03.710
However,
there are certain shows that I don't like the sound of.
Yeah,

238
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.180
like panics.

239
00:16:05.181 --> 00:16:09.470
Nine one one calls generally not soothing for somebody falling asleep.

240
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:14.030
So you go,
hold on,
see if you go,

241
00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.970
you're like,
all right,
good night and you go to,

242
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:21.320
<v 0>you go to bed and I'm just like,
all right babe.</v>

243
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:25.550
I click on the TV,
pull up what I'm going to watch.

244
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:29.660
And as you're drifting off to sleep,
you're,

245
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.990
you're basically getting ready to go to bed.

246
00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.153
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

247
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:38.750
You here leave this place this morning or investigating the death of the

248
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.380
prominent resident.
You hear that sizzle call early.
This your nighttime.

249
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:45.200
I love you.
I love you.
All right,
I'll see you in the morning.

250
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.500
And I have really fallen,

251
00:16:48.501 --> 00:16:52.970
lay my head down now for a long day when Peterson's husband is novelist Michael

252
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.960
Peterson for his books on the Begat Don Moore.
He is also a former,

253
00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:02.040
then ran an unsuccessful by all campaign in 1999 era.

254
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.030
This refused additional comment on the depth.

255
00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:11.490
I mean it's already terrifying.
The fall asleep.
Yeah.

256
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.820
This and then this music spooky music.
It's terrible.

257
00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:17.450
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

258
00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:20.310
<v 6>I don't know what part of this is soothing for you before you</v>

259
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:22.190
<v 5>go to bed.
Yeah.</v>

260
00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.740
<v 6>How do you watch all this shit before you fall asleep?</v>

261
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:30.220
<v 3>Isn't it give you nightmares ma'am?
No,
Kathleen and I were in here.
What?</v>

262
00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.550
So this guy,
I remember this bit.
Yeah,

263
00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:36.210
I remember it cause I'm listening to a Kelly.
Now we're having wine out here.

264
00:17:36.211 --> 00:17:37.170
That's right.
Right.

265
00:17:37.171 --> 00:17:42.171
And then Kathleen went upstairs and then I went in shortly after and then I

266
00:17:42.211 --> 00:17:45.360
found her at the bottom of the staircase.
Yeah.
And then,

267
00:17:45.361 --> 00:17:48.990
then they play the nine one one call and that's when I piped up and I was like,

268
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:53.700
the fuck are you watching dude?
That's right.
That's right.
What are you watching?

269
00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:58.930
<v 7>Yeah,
she was alive when I thought,
yeah,
okay.
Barely.
Yeah,</v>

270
00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:00.703
<v 8>Tom.
Now</v>

271
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.590
<v 3>this what?
I'm trying to fall asleep tonight,
sweetie.
I love,
you know,
but this,</v>

272
00:18:04.591 --> 00:18:07.710
here's the best part.
Or your son's asleep.
The House is nice and quiet.

273
00:18:07.711 --> 00:18:10.920
The dogs have been let out.
The dogs were on the bed snoring with me.

274
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.990
I'm all ready for sleep.

275
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:18.020
The best part is that the exact exchange was that you hadn't been speaking here

276
00:18:18.841 --> 00:18:23.820
for a few minutes.
Right?
And then it's silent.
Okay.
It's totally silent.

277
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:25.910
And then I hear you

278
00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:30.650
<v 8>Tom now or where your market,
they can't go see the street.
Please.
What?</v>

279
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.960
[inaudible] she's still breathing.
What kind of bag?

280
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:35.590
<v 3>And then I hear Christina go,</v>

281
00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.600
it's really nice to fall asleep to nine one one calls.
I started laughing

282
00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:45.060
because you go and then I'm like,
I start laughing and you go,
God,
how do you,

283
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:47.690
I'm trying to sleep and this is playing.

284
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.040
It's the worst thing you can do yourself.

285
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:56.250
<v 8>Please go meet conscious.
Oh my God.
And I'm trying to sleep</v>

286
00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:58.933
all day

287
00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:04.300
<v 3>and all I want is to dream of like puppies and Unicorns and that dude.</v>

288
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:08.640
So clearly acting
what?
Huh?

289
00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.500
You can tell,
I mean,
the way that I listened to that is like,

290
00:19:11.501 --> 00:19:15.040
this is completely false.
Yeah.
I'm not even hearing that.

291
00:19:15.041 --> 00:19:19.080
Like I just don't want to hear a person suffering or calling in that their wife

292
00:19:19.081 --> 00:19:23.170
is dead.
I'm like,
oh my gosh,
there's,
so the premise,
by the way,
this is,

293
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:25.540
you've learned this eight minutes or whatever,

294
00:19:25.541 --> 00:19:29.660
30 seconds into this whole series is that this man found him,

295
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.460
found his wife at the bottom of the stairs,
right.
Dead,

296
00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:38.620
but in a pool of blood and with blood spatter all over the walls.
And he's like,

297
00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:41.780
she fell down the stairs.
And what happens when you fall down the stairs?

298
00:19:41.781 --> 00:19:45.550
Just start bleeding a lot.
Yeah.
And then they're like,
uh,
and then he goes,

299
00:19:45.551 --> 00:19:49.360
as soon as the detectives got here,
they treated me like a suspect.
It's like,

300
00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:52.900
yeah,
Oh yeah,
dip shit.
You're the only one there with her while he's like,

301
00:19:52.901 --> 00:19:57.760
you know,
she fell on the stairs in there.
Like,
um,
there's blood everywhere.

302
00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:02.020
The one thing every woman says who's been abused and I just fell down the
stairs.

303
00:20:02.021 --> 00:20:04.300
Like everyone uses that as an excuse.

304
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.420
I mean I'm not an expert but I dunno.

305
00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:11.270
Sure doesn't look like like a fall down the stairs when you see the photo.

306
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.150
Just I wish there were cameras and our bedroom where like I'm just like this

307
00:20:15.151 --> 00:20:18.370
sweet little angel that I am just trying to sleep and I hear,

308
00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:20.950
oh I fell out of the nine one one.
What's your emergency?

309
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:26.330
<v 8>It's terrible.
This is terrible.
Calm down.</v>

310
00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.601
Calm down.

311
00:20:28.601 --> 00:20:33.601
So I don't know how many hit right away plus dispatching the ambulance.

312
00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:39.383
Okay.

313
00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:41.810
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

314
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:46.430
<v 3>And your look how happy you are.
Like how joyful that make Troy flows.
Horrible.</v>

315
00:20:46.431 --> 00:20:47.201
But yeah,

316
00:20:47.201 --> 00:20:50.980
but now you love it because you have another murder show to get into law series.

317
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.170
I'm like halfway through it.
I didn't realize,

318
00:20:53.171 --> 00:20:57.550
I think this came out a while ago and they added three new episodes.

319
00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:02.080
Oh.
So also making a murderer is going to have a whole new season.

320
00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.950
Hopefully you can watch those while I'm sleeping too.
Yeah,

321
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:11.230
I can go into my subconscious mind.
Give me nightmares.
The terrorists.
No,

322
00:21:11.231 --> 00:21:13.660
you go.
So you're like talking about and you're like,
God,

323
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.230
isn't this mess with your sleep?
And I'm like,
not at all.
No.
Zero,
no,

324
00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.250
this is how you go.
This is what you drift off to.
You know?

325
00:21:21.251 --> 00:21:25.000
I think it's so important to be cautious about what you put into your mind

326
00:21:25.001 --> 00:21:28.030
before you sleeve.
Yeah,
no,
I mean I'm,
I'm being very serious.
I,

327
00:21:28.031 --> 00:21:31.390
that's why I used to listen to like Louise Hay.
I do,
you know,

328
00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:35.410
whatever affirmations or maybe a nice meditation before bed.

329
00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:40.330
So this really goes against everything I believe in terms of the unconscious

330
00:21:40.331 --> 00:21:45.250
mind,
cause I do loop on things.
Sure.
Now what's important?
It's terrible.

331
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.460
This is terrible.
This is a terrible way to fall asleep at night.
I love it.

332
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.760
I love watching the thrillers lunacy.

333
00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:55.090
I mean a lot of people watch this kind of stuff before bed.
A lot of people do,

334
00:21:55.091 --> 00:21:57.580
but I,
I'm not a lot of people and I don't agree with it.

335
00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:02.170
I think that it's really crazy.
Yeah.
I think that's really not good for you.

336
00:22:02.171 --> 00:22:06.700
Bad to what?
Violence and murder before bedtime.
It's,

337
00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:11.350
it's an your,
it's gets in your mind totally like a muppet and that photo.

338
00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:15.940
Yeah,
a little bit right now.
What do you mean?
Which muppet?
I Dunno.

339
00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:20.620
I feel like it's like a muppet.
No,
you look good.
Anyways,
I can,

340
00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:24.520
I can't recommend this series enough.
The staircase on Netflix.

341
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.840
I'm a really into it.
It's really good.
Oh boy.

342
00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:33.580
Onto if residented access to a trial like this.
Yeah.
I woke,

343
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:36.070
I wake up to pee every hour and I wake up.

344
00:22:36.071 --> 00:22:40.150
I woke up to like a gay escort giving his,
what's that word?

345
00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.240
It's an unbelievable stories testimony,
which is funny.

346
00:22:43.241 --> 00:22:47.020
I wasn't getting unbelievable story.
But what you normally get in the news is,

347
00:22:47.021 --> 00:22:49.480
you know,
you see maybe trial coverage on something.

348
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:53.170
These cameras are home with the suspect,
the guy on trial.

349
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:57.580
Like you see him having dinner with his family,
talking about stuff.

350
00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.390
The defense attorney's planning out every possible defense.

351
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.620
Everything that they think that the prosecutors would bring.

352
00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:09.040
Imagine defending the guy.
That fact that they have to know.

353
00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.380
They have to know this guy's a piece of shit,

354
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:16.020
but they sell it hard that he's not yet.
Well,
they have.
That's,

355
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:20.590
that's the Gig I remember for the two weeks I was in law school.
They go,

356
00:23:20.591 --> 00:23:24.340
they're going to bring up probably this other person that you knew that died

357
00:23:24.341 --> 00:23:26.920
under suspicious circumstances.
We're just going to have to,
you know,

358
00:23:26.921 --> 00:23:28.300
he's going to be like,
oh,

359
00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:32.440
that's just what they taught me in criminal law for the two weeks I was in law

360
00:23:32.441 --> 00:23:36.310
school,
is that it doesn't matter the guilt or innocence of your client.

361
00:23:36.311 --> 00:23:41.050
You're just presenting the best possible,
not version of the law,

362
00:23:41.051 --> 00:23:45.600
but the best possible defense within the law.
So that's what happens.
It's,

363
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.230
it's,
it doesn't matter if they did it or not.

364
00:23:48.231 --> 00:23:51.650
You're still giving them the best possible crazy thing to say.
Scenario what?

365
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:55.940
Just that sentence.
Yeah.
It doesn't matter whether it's irrelevant,

366
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:57.850
if they're guilty or not.
There's still,

367
00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:01.130
they still didn't deserve a defense according to the law and the medical costs

368
00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:05.990
will fucking in the constitution works.
But it's crazy.

369
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:08.780
It is crazy.
I know this guy raped and murdered somebody.

370
00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:11.870
And I'm not saying this case,
I'm just saying in general sense.

371
00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:14.270
I know this person did this horrific crime,

372
00:24:14.271 --> 00:24:16.970
but I got to relevant to give him as best defense policy.
He's,

373
00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:21.110
everybody's do their process under the law.
It's just crazy.
It's crazy.

374
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:25.040
I couldn't,
I couldn't,
I,
that's why I tapped out after two weeks I was like,

375
00:24:25.041 --> 00:24:28.460
this is not for me.
Does this way of thinking is unnatural?

376
00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:31.610
Who's still paying off that?
Um,
it took me,

377
00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:36.080
I'll tell you how much to two weeks in law school back in the early two

378
00:24:36.081 --> 00:24:38.870
thousands cost me $6,000 six grand.

379
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.540
I remember when I was dating you and you were still like,
yeah,

380
00:24:41.541 --> 00:24:44.870
I'm paying off law school.
Yeah,
it took,
it took a few years,

381
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.430
but I did it man.
Oh,
another thing I want,
I don't want to forget,

382
00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:53.540
I did a lot of appearances last week.
Are you,
did,

383
00:24:53.541 --> 00:24:57.950
you did the hot wings shot ones,
which is coming out next week.

384
00:24:57.951 --> 00:25:01.100
So if you're listening to the show,
as it comes out next week,

385
00:25:01.101 --> 00:25:03.920
I'm on a hot ones with Sean Evans.
Had a great time.

386
00:25:03.921 --> 00:25:08.030
So you ate the hot ones and then you made a lot of hot browns for two days after

387
00:25:08.031 --> 00:25:12.820
your that you were at my butthole.
Absolutely destroyed my asshole.
Uh,

388
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:14.270
it was worth it.
I mean he's,

389
00:25:14.271 --> 00:25:19.271
he's the best interviewer in the game and it was a really fun show to do,

390
00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:21.320
but I wish they would follow up with you.

391
00:25:21.321 --> 00:25:25.520
Like here's you eating the hot ones and then here's you shitting the hot ones.

392
00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:30.200
Oh my God.
And it also was,
it wasn't just one shit,
no shit.
Later that day,

393
00:25:30.201 --> 00:25:34.880
twice the next morning I had a real hot brown and then later in the morning I

394
00:25:34.881 --> 00:25:38.980
had another hot brown,
they should call it hot brown ones.
Yeah,

395
00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:44.300
I um,
I don't know.
We laughed a lot.
We had a good time.
That was great.
I also,

396
00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:48.020
I also appeared on the h three h three podcasts.

397
00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:53.050
Ether and Heela Klein were so much fun trying to get them to come on your mom's

398
00:25:53.241 --> 00:25:55.790
house.
Uh,
I had a great time with them.

399
00:25:55.791 --> 00:25:58.700
I did their podcast number 69,

400
00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.600
69 number 69 podcasts.

401
00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:07.520
Um,
perfect.
Yeah,
those two are hilarious and sweet.

402
00:26:07.521 --> 00:26:11.750
And then I also appeared on the tomorrow show with Kevin Undergaro.

403
00:26:11.751 --> 00:26:16.680
So if you don't have your full fix of me,
um,

404
00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:19.400
download or go to youtube,
go to the tomorrow show,

405
00:26:19.401 --> 00:26:23.840
go to the h three podcasts and like I said,
in a week I'll be on hot ones.

406
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:27.740
I just wanted to plug all those before.
Yeah.
Um,

407
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:32.180
where will your about Holby my butthole.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Oh,

408
00:26:32.181 --> 00:26:36.770
where are my Boho will be?
Oh,
this is kind of a dude.
Check this out.

409
00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:37.760
Um,

410
00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:42.760
we were talking about tipping a massage therapist so that we can fart during

411
00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:47.940
roadside.
No.
Hey there mommy.

412
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.770
I am actually a certified massage therapist.
I was listening to your podcast.

413
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.600
You guys seem to be very uncomfortable with farting during massage.
Well,

414
00:26:56.601 --> 00:26:57.150
who isn't?

415
00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:00.210
I mean it happens all the time and they trained us in school that people get

416
00:27:00.211 --> 00:27:01.410
relaxed enough to fart.

417
00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:05.130
And in some weird way it can be considered a compliment even though it kind of

418
00:27:05.131 --> 00:27:09.540
sucks it deal with it means we're doing our job correctly and we always have

419
00:27:09.541 --> 00:27:13.410
essential oils and fabric sprays if it gets bad to put under our nose.

420
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:17.910
So just relax and let us do our job.
Don't clench up,
let it rip.

421
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:22.110
Body Odor,
however,
is an entirely different issue.

422
00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:26.430
You don't shower before you go to get a massage and you are a trash human being.

423
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.710
Farts dissipate quickly.

424
00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:32.280
Body odor stays the entire fucking time and it's horrible.

425
00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:36.690
Signed Dylan.
Well,
what animals going into a massage?
Filthy.

426
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.740
I mean apparently enough where Dylan is bringing it up and I think you're a real

427
00:27:40.741 --> 00:27:43.740
piece of garbage for doing that.
I think so too.
I don't think that's fair.

428
00:27:43.741 --> 00:27:47.730
I always showered like moments before.
Yeah,
that's courteous.

429
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:49.540
Now here's the thing,

430
00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:53.880
now what the fart during the massage is that if you just do one good clench.

431
00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:54.360
Yeah,

432
00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:58.710
I found that that usually remedies at the fart just goes back up inside of you

433
00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:02.940
and you're done.
Usually.
Yeah,
I,
I'm not comfortable farting on mine either.

434
00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:07.230
I don't,
I don't know.
I know it's just,
it's too much.
It's too much.

435
00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:12.090
Too much.
Too much.
I don't like it.

436
00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:16.140
I don't want to do it.
I'm not going to keep fighting during massage.

437
00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:21.870
Apropos our discussion the other day we were laying in bed and,
um,

438
00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:28.580
you I think were farting or burping or something and we started to have this

439
00:28:29.251 --> 00:28:31.710
discussion and I was like,
no,
no,
no.
Let's save this for the show.
This is,

440
00:28:31.711 --> 00:28:36.660
this is what we get paid for it.
Right,
right,
right.
So would you rather,

441
00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:42.680
would you rather have super burps or Super Fart?

442
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:46.770
It's a good question.
I'm talking so you know what I mean?

443
00:28:46.771 --> 00:28:51.510
When you do like a sonic Burp,
like super loud,
sorry.
Yeah.

444
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.890
Or
King ass rapper.

445
00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.690
That was him.
Of course,

446
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:04.770
that's the king or ass rappers farts all the time.

447
00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:08.370
Now.
It's really painful to

448
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.750
never heard.
Of course,
to talent.
Yeah.

449
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:17.150
I don't like

450
00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:18.830
<v 8>the [inaudible].</v>

451
00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.120
<v 3>So it's basically that every time you burp</v>

452
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:30.420
and you're at the mall with like the wife and the kid,
right.

453
00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.050
And we're all there and that's what you do.
And,

454
00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:37.420
or it's a sonic fart,
like a crazy,
crazy for it.

455
00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:42.210
I can't ask for per fart,
and the smell is pretty bad too.
Yeah.

456
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:45.910
That's not even the best.
No,
I know.

457
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:47.163
<v 9>Oh,</v>

458
00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:52.643
oh

459
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.460
<v 3>Jesus.
Because I feel as though my life,</v>

460
00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:00.700
I hear a lot of that stuff from you all the time.

461
00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:05.830
I'm definitely going Super Burp.
Why is that?
I just feel like it's,

462
00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:10.150
it's more one of those things where is the gross,

463
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:15.570
but it's not as gross as your asshole people and joy and it can be kind of

464
00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:21.070
amazed and fun with a big burp.
Big,
far.
People were like,
Oh man,

465
00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:24.760
you're,
they're just basically,
they're like,
you need to shit.

466
00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:26.410
That's what everyone is thinking,
right?

467
00:30:26.411 --> 00:30:29.830
You're upsetting people with the big farts.
Totally.
A big BURP.

468
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:31.180
You could do that at a party.

469
00:30:31.181 --> 00:30:34.600
You can do that at dinner and everyone kind of laughs like Jesus,
that's gross,

470
00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:39.100
but I can stick around for everyone wants to run away from you,
you know?

471
00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:44.500
Okay.
Now what if I took the smell out of the farts?
Yeah,
but here's the thing.

472
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.140
They don't know that it doesn't smell.

473
00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.730
Everyone's going to assume that it smells like shit right next to her.

474
00:30:49.731 --> 00:30:54.180
I wasn't going to run away.
You burp like that.
It's still,
it's funny.
It's a,

475
00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:57.730
it's a,
it's a good time.
That was a good party is a good time.

476
00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:00.700
A big BURP is really fun.
It's always fun.

477
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.780
There was this girl in high school who could drink like a can of Dr Pepper and

478
00:31:04.781 --> 00:31:08.290
then she could belch the alphabet.
Right.
That's how talented she was.

479
00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:09.700
This is a check,
by the way.

480
00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:13.930
No girls are very good Berbers no women or women are right.

481
00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.390
I went to an all girls Catholic high school.
Yeah.

482
00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:20.870
There were a lot of chicks that could do it like that.

483
00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:21.753
<v 8>Yes.</v>

484
00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:27.540
<v 3>I mean,
I,
first time I do feel like women are,
might be better at Sonic Belgians.</v>

485
00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:32.420
My cousin Janette burps.
Jeanette.
This chick from my high school.
Yeah.
I'm in.

486
00:31:32.421 --> 00:31:36.470
There are a few girls from high school now.
I do.
I feel like a women can do it.

487
00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:41.450
I think super fart thing.
I mean,
it's cool.
I'm surprised.

488
00:31:41.451 --> 00:31:43.960
Honestly.
I thought you would have gone forward.
No,

489
00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:48.860
I think I'm a little disappointed have,
but I think that's cool.
Yeah.

490
00:31:48.861 --> 00:31:51.320
I mean it's not,
I mean,
I'd like to ask you for as far as all the time,

491
00:31:51.321 --> 00:31:53.700
but I think the burp one just,

492
00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:59.120
it has more mileage to it.
It's more fun.
What if,
when Charles in town,

493
00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:04.540
which do you do see it's because of which the burbs upsets her warning.

494
00:32:05.411 --> 00:32:08.960
Yeah,
they do.
Why is that?
Like,
I don't know.
She finds it.

495
00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:14.290
I think she thinks a little bit of Fart is a little less in your control.

496
00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:18.440
Fart needs to come out and that a burp.

497
00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:20.930
You're doing it just to be gross,

498
00:32:20.931 --> 00:32:23.990
but you are because you can close your mouth and go boom.

499
00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:28.370
And the Bourbon you're up.
Oh my God.
But Barb,

500
00:32:28.371 --> 00:32:32.570
you can just go,
you can change and go ah,
and let it out that way.

501
00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:37.490
Speaking of which,
we've been having these meetings lately with various,

502
00:32:37.491 --> 00:32:38.181
whenever people,

503
00:32:38.181 --> 00:32:43.181
and you burped as you were talking to this important person.

504
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:46.401
Yeah,
Babe.

505
00:32:46.401 --> 00:32:51.401
We were in our manager's office and this lovely gentleman agreed to meet with

506
00:32:52.431 --> 00:32:55.950
us.
And you were like,
so anyway,
the story book move by bubble.

507
00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:58.590
We're working with him now.
Is that the one?
Yeah,
but I'm Kinda,

508
00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:02.660
I'm glad that he knows now who he's dealing with.

509
00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:06.230
He's going to hear more of that.
But you did have to excuse yourself.
You're like,

510
00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:11.050
yeah babe.
And I'm like,
this isn't the first time he's,
I feel like I burped way.

511
00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:16.010
Oh,
I burped on hot ones.
A big BURP.
Cause it was between

512
00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.420
wings.
Belch.
Yeah.

513
00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:23.210
And then you burped one time with sickle cell.

514
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:28.370
You guys were meeting with some executives and I farted when he left the room.

515
00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:32.360
Burped in the guy's face.
Basically.
I went on a Tom.

516
00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:37.220
Yeah.
I didn't do it like that.
I just,

517
00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:42.350
it went in my mouth and I go,
Hey Tom.
He knew it was happening.

518
00:33:42.351 --> 00:33:45.990
You were hiding anything.
No,
no.
You still can't really hide a burger.

519
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:49.370
Brian was like,
Jesus Christ,
man.
He goes,

520
00:33:49.371 --> 00:33:52.790
you fucking burped and there partying here.
It's going on with you.

521
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:58.060
That's how that's life with Tom.
So you would take the sonic burps,

522
00:33:58.061 --> 00:34:02.120
what would you take?
I think to annoy you,

523
00:34:02.121 --> 00:34:06.800
I would go sonic farts and here's why.
Here's why,
as a woman,

524
00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:11.540
if you let out a sonic fart in public,
nobody's going to assume it's me.

525
00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:15.350
They're always going to assume it's going to hear it's,
you know,
not necessarily.

526
00:34:15.351 --> 00:34:19.310
Cause if I'm standing next to you in public and people are just going to think

527
00:34:19.311 --> 00:34:21.620
it's you.
That's true.
So I feel like

528
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.330
I remember the year of Farts,
uh,
that started,

529
00:34:26.331 --> 00:34:29.210
I think in Arizona we were checking in for a delta flight.

530
00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:34.720
Might've been 2012 or something and we were both checking in and it was

531
00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:40.160
afternoon.
It was new year's New Year's Day.
Yeah.
We were flying home from again,

532
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:44.660
we were at a kiosk.
Yes,
that's right.
And as you're checking in for the flights,

533
00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.610
there's a,
there's another,

534
00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:51.860
the opposite side of the kiosk is another screen so people can be on either side

535
00:34:51.861 --> 00:34:54.710
of it.
And I farted and it was loud,

536
00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:57.770
really loud and there was basically a guy behind the kiosk

537
00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:02.870
and he leaned over.
Like,
I heard that,
hey,
and I was like,

538
00:35:02.871 --> 00:35:04.360
that's what I'm doing this year.
Yeah.

539
00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:08.860
This year is the year of course farting and just owning it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

540
00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:11.540
Not Hiding it.
Not Hiding it.
And it works.

541
00:35:11.541 --> 00:35:16.030
You can do it just like calling people jeans all the time or mommy,

542
00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:19.550
which we do constantly.
No pushback.
Zero pushback.

543
00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:23.240
Who's going to call you out on a fart dude,

544
00:35:23.241 --> 00:35:27.110
do you want to hear the fucking funniest prank call?

545
00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:31.900
This guy?
I think it's Tony.
Yeah,
it's Tony.
He um,

546
00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:36.390
I think he goes by Dj skull vomit.
He has this amazing,

547
00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:38.340

664
00:44:53.611 --> 00:44:58.290
I think,
hi,
Mommy's me.
I first say thanks for keeping it real on the podcast.

665
00:44:58.291 --> 00:45:00.840
You guys are fucking hilarious.
I'm wondering if you can help me with a problem.

666
00:45:00.841 --> 00:45:03.560
My boyfriend has a real hygiene issue when it comes to the Brown.

667
00:45:03.561 --> 00:45:05.040
This keeps coming up,
this kind of stuff.

668
00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:07.480
I've been doing his laundry for a couple of years.

669
00:45:07.481 --> 00:45:11.220
I witnessed his use of clean underwear steadily decline,
huh?

670
00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:15.080
He normally uses about six pairs every two weeks wearing.

671
00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:23.040
He wears each pair for up to three days.
Negative.
Well,

672
00:45:23.041 --> 00:45:25.350
I think this is disgusting.

673
00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:30.960
He thinks it's normal because he scrubs his butt hole using my expense of facial

674
00:45:30.961 --> 00:45:34.500
cleaner.
After each and every poop,
sometimes even drawing blood.

675
00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:37.560
Can you please correct his backwards ass on this matter?

676
00:45:37.561 --> 00:45:40.780
I need him to man up and change his God damn underwear every day.

677
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:45.740
I also need to stop using my face soap on his hairy anus and balls.
P.

678
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:49.320
S I'm going to be one of the five women who buys the four stroke gang merge.

You what kind of nasty motherfucker?
I mean that's wrong.
Every three days.</v>

683
00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:11.310
Yeah.
No,
it doesn't matter if your genitals and your butthole or clean,

684
00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:15.660
you still have to change them because there's still residue of poop.
Residue.

685
00:46:15.661 --> 00:46:19.110
Sweat.
Yeah.
Usage.
Why can't he,

686
00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:24.060
can he not afford daily boxers or underwear?
I don't know what's going on.
No,
no,

687
00:46:24.061 --> 00:46:27.570
no.
She needs to sit down with him.
Really talk about it.

688
00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:31.650
That's nasty as hell.
It's pretty nasty.
I agree.

689
00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.080
You can't wear the same underwear more than one.

690
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:38.740
<v 0>I don't know how anybody is down with,
with the,
I'm talking men,
women,</v>

691
00:46:38.741 --> 00:46:43.720
non binaries.
Yeah.
If you're a homeless thug,
whatever.

692
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:47.200
I uh,
I mean that's the one thing when I go on the road,

693
00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:52.270
I have a routine for packing.
I basically bring double.
Yeah.

694
00:46:52.271 --> 00:46:55.930
Not of underwear that there are days I do too because three days you'll burn

695
00:46:56.100 --> 00:47:00.490
similar.
Yeah.
There's certain days where you know,
you arrive,
you,

696
00:47:00.491 --> 00:47:03.890
let's say you shower,
you switch out the underwear,
new underwear too.
In one day.

697
00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:07.150
Right.
You've been sitting on a plane.
Mass balls are sweating.

698
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:12.130
Even fart farting all day.
Nasty.
Yeah.
You switch if you go to the hotel.

699
00:47:12.131 --> 00:47:14.980
I mean I always go to hotel gym.
You're sweating in that.

700
00:47:14.981 --> 00:47:18.400
You can't wear that sweaty fucking underwear out.
It's fucking nasty man.

701
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:20.370
<v 3>And then you got your show Shoney's.
Yeah.</v>

702
00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:23.190
You got to take that shit off after it cause they're all sweaty after even

703
00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:26.970
telling jokes for two hours.
Always bring extra more you.

704
00:47:26.971 --> 00:47:30.880
This is disgusting one here I'm under him for three days is so fucking foul.

705
00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:35.680
Even my Stepdad who was gnarly,
like all of his shorts were Brown.
It's summer.

706
00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:40.230
He would never do that.
Like I feel like that would your dad do multiple days on,

707
00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:45.980
I mean I don't think he does,
but he was also like if we're on a,
like if,

708
00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:49.030
if you're on a trip or something and you realize you didn't pack the underwear

709
00:47:49.031 --> 00:47:51.850
you need.
I'm always someone who's like,
well where's the store?

710
00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:56.170
I had to go buy him.
My Dad would flip his underwear inside out.
So nasty.

711
00:47:56.171 --> 00:47:58.390
I think I would rather wash them in the sink.

712
00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:01.900
Like if I didn't have access to buying them,
wash them everyday.
You're right.

713
00:48:01.901 --> 00:48:06.610
Do Something Air I'm out to to how is,
how are you like laying this TV?

714
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:10.390
I mean his balls and Dick,
my stank to you.
They can't.
You can't do that.

715
00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:12.490
That was funky.
I know what I'm saying.
It's summertime right now.

716
00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:17.050
Doesn't he walk around and sweat,
you know?
Yeah.
Just hot ball,

717
00:48:17.051 --> 00:48:18.640
sweat and pubes are down there.

718
00:48:18.641 --> 00:48:22.870
As he does he go to the gym or exercise and extend the wearing of that cause

719
00:48:22.871 --> 00:48:27.310
that is real sleep.
Why can't ask you this?
Why are men so fucking disgusting?

720
00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:31.840
Like do we,
are you guys just not taught hygiene from your parents?

721
00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:37.480
It depends on your upbringing and whether being fouls encouraged or not.

722
00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:42.010
Because there's a lot of dudes who are really hygienic and over the top with it,

723
00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:43.001
but I think it's,
you know,

724
00:48:43.001 --> 00:48:46.660
either have their own neuroses about it or they're raised that way.

725
00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:48.910
They're raised to believe that,
you know,

726
00:48:48.911 --> 00:48:51.430
you gotta be really on top of the cleanliness.

727
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:55.270
But if you're raised by people who you know,

728
00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:59.110
encourage file behavior,
you're just going to go,
who's going to grow into it?

729
00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:02.230
Yeah,
of course.
That is so fucking nasty.
Well,
how are you not a barbarian?

730
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:05.650
Your Dad is an animal moving around all the time.

731
00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:09.040
I had three girls who were like,
that's nuts.

732
00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:14.220
And I see how they reacted to dudes being gross.
It's so,

733
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:18.460
I am gross,
but I check it on certain things and gross.
Yeah,

734
00:49:18.461 --> 00:49:22.850
I'm Harry and gross.
But I definitely believe in showers.
Clean clothes,

735
00:49:23.350 --> 00:49:26.980
change your clothes.
You don't do multiple days on the same underpants.
No,

736
00:49:26.981 --> 00:49:29.950
you're not.
You're not disgusting like that.
I've always been sloppy,

737
00:49:29.951 --> 00:49:33.160
but I always said I was sloppy,
but not disgust.
That's right.

738
00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:34.750
Throw clothes on the ground,

739
00:49:34.751 --> 00:49:38.470
but I don't like hair in the sink and clean that stuff up.

740
00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:42.940
It's questionable.
I do.
You leave the hair on the sink,

741
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:46.060
which doesn't even bother me.
I don't like,
I don't like hair on the toilet.

742
00:49:46.061 --> 00:49:49.480
Stuff like that.
That's nasty.
Why is her hair on the toilet though?

743
00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:54.230
Just like pubes will fall,
you know,
that kind of thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.

744
00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:57.190
I think seeing like a funky toilet is gross to me.
That's nasty.

745
00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:01.180
But are far toilets all these funky with yours Brown splatters.

746
00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:06.100
But I'm saying I'm not a fan of that.
Yeah,
no,
I know.

747
00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:10.580
It's disgusting.
That's so nasty.
I wanted,
there's not,

748
00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:15.000
I wonder if there is nasty girls too.
Probably the do that.
Uh,
yeah.

749
00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:20.050
That's nasty.
Now you got to have the conversation with this guy.
This guy.

750
00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:24.940
I gotta go pee real bad.
Oh really?
Pause.
Yeah.
Oh,
okay.
That's nasty.

751
00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:30.350
Hold on,
hold on.
There you go.
You peed.

752
00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:32.840
You're having a snack.
You're pregnant.

753
00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:40.460
It's exciting.
I mean,
my cheese man,
eating your cheese.
All in all,

754
00:50:40.461 --> 00:50:42.380
it's pregnancy has been pretty easy except for written.

755
00:50:42.381 --> 00:50:44.840
This is the last four weeks are fucking horrible.

756
00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:49.430
But the polities helped a lot and been watching my diet.
It's been,

757
00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:53.210
it's been pretty decent.
I've been taking boxing lessons do.

758
00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:57.380
How crazy is boxing?
We were watching that movie creed.
Yeah.
It's a great movie.

759
00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:02.210
Yeah.
It's so fucking hard.
Like that's gotta be the hardest thing to do.

760
00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:06.770
You have a whole new appreciation for ah,
it's really the conditioning.

761
00:51:06.771 --> 00:51:10.310
That's the craziest,
I mean,
yeah,
all of it is a skill set.
You know,

762
00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:14.110
the punching to Kci Pine Change,
the um,

763
00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:17.580
the movements anticipation.
I mean it's,
it's a skill set,

764
00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:20.960
but the conditioning he would,
I think you end up going like,

765
00:51:20.961 --> 00:51:22.370
how the fuck are these guys do this?

766
00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:27.530
What incredible shape these dudes are interesting to be able to just to stay in

767
00:51:27.531 --> 00:51:31.790
the ring.
Just to be like,
you know,
doing that stuff.
How long is it boxing match?

768
00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:35.930
I mean generally three minutes.
No,
I but let's say an hour.
Theoretically.

769
00:51:35.931 --> 00:51:39.320
How many rounds can they go and how,
how many minutes are each round?
I don't,

770
00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:40.693
so you know,

771
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:44.960
you have 10 and 12 round matches bouts and,

772
00:51:44.961 --> 00:51:47.870
and each minute is,
each round is three minutes,

773
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:51.260
which is like one time I took a,
anyway,

774
00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:55.490
I tried kickboxing once in my twenties and just carrying the bag and kicking it

775
00:51:55.491 --> 00:51:59.360
and shit like that for a minute.
Yeah.
I mean that's so exhausting.

776
00:51:59.361 --> 00:52:01.070
I used to be just exhausted.
No,

777
00:52:01.071 --> 00:52:03.830
it makes you realize when you walk after you do it a bunch and you,

778
00:52:03.831 --> 00:52:08.060
then you watch one,
you're like,
oh my God,
how do these guys,
I'll do,

779
00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:10.160
I'll do,

780
00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:15.160
sometimes we do these combinations where you'll do 30 seconds of each

781
00:52:16.311 --> 00:52:21.050
combination without a break for a minute and a half.
And if you're,

782
00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:23.900
you're going in,
you know,
high speed,

783
00:52:23.901 --> 00:52:25.790
you're building up and you're hitting it harder and harder.

784
00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:28.680
I mean a minute and a half and you're like,
I'm feeling I'm going to die.

785
00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:32.480
Could you imagine what it feels like after you're done with a fight?

786
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:36.170
Like a full of fight.
I know.
And those MMA guys do five minute rounds.

787
00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:37.390
That's crazy.

788
00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:42.090
And they're getting kicked and hit in the band or being choked out and like

789
00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:45.590
you're wrestling at five minutes is an eternity.

790
00:52:45.591 --> 00:52:49.940
It sure is three minutes.
If you're really boxing,
dancing,
move and touch him.

791
00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:54.650
Twinging ducking dip and sliding,
slipping punches,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop.

792
00:52:54.651 --> 00:52:59.651
I mean you go through a combination like that and like a little back and forth.

793
00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:03.440
You know,
maybe 20 seconds have passed and you're like,
fuck,

794
00:53:03.441 --> 00:53:07.900
there's no hard 40 of this left.
So fucking hard.
Yeah,
I know.
I remember.

795
00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:10.460
It's a lot.
It's,
it's the conditioning.

796
00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:12.950
It's why you see those guys when they in they're in camp,

797
00:53:12.951 --> 00:53:17.360
they're just running miles and miles and miles.
Oh yeah,
it's nuts.

798
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:20.360
Oh you know what an appearance you didn't mention that you did was Dr Drew's

799
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:23.840
show.
I did.
Dr Drew's also was nonstop for me last week.

800
00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:26.380
I started getting messages like,
Hey man,
what do you promote it?

801
00:53:26.381 --> 00:53:28.500
You're doing a bunch of press.
I was like,
it just happened this week.

802
00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:31.890
Well cause you were on the road for so long and I think it kind of got

803
00:53:31.891 --> 00:53:36.180
backlogged with people and I ask you to do things.
How about this this week?

804
00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:40.650
And then what happened was the other things just were added to it after I had

805
00:53:40.651 --> 00:53:43.190
committed to a few and I was like,
well I guess I'll just keep doing it.

806
00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:46.890
What I wanted was fun.
Yes,
of course.
He's amazing.

807
00:53:46.891 --> 00:53:51.170
Of course him and Mike Catherine would great too.
He's so sweet.
Um,

808
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:53.520
is the Anthony Bourdain we never spoke about.

809
00:53:53.521 --> 00:53:56.110
I cannot believe we'd have not talked about Anthony Bordain.
Well,

810
00:53:56.190 --> 00:54:00.300
I'll be honest that I didn't even want to talk about it last week because I was

811
00:54:00.301 --> 00:54:04.140
so upset and I'm such a,
I'm such an admirer of his,

812
00:54:04.141 --> 00:54:05.730
I read all the books.

813
00:54:05.731 --> 00:54:10.731
I've been a fan of his since 2005 and I was really upset.

814
00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:16.220
I think he took three days before I finally could let the news sink in and I'd

815
00:54:16.291 --> 00:54:20.910
forget about it.
And then I remember and just be like,
oh my gosh,
I can't,

816
00:54:20.911 --> 00:54:25.590
I can't believe he's gone.
It really,
it affected me too.
Also,

817
00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:30.690
he became one of those personalities that,
um,

818
00:54:31.290 --> 00:54:34.240
I kinda just took for granted as being there.
Yeah,
right.
Yeah.

819
00:54:34.330 --> 00:54:37.020
Who I you're talking about?
Yeah.
You're like,
I like him a lot.

820
00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:41.880
I really like him a lot.
I kind of,
you know,
I mean,
first of all,
look,

821
00:54:41.881 --> 00:54:46.060
I just don't watch a lot of anything anymore except for,
it's like nighttime.

822
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:50.070
Well,
you know,
it's time to,
when it's time to,
for me to watch something,

823
00:54:50.071 --> 00:54:55.071
it's nine 30 at night and it's usually a movie or a show the scripted,

824
00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:58.990
you know,
and I watch what I watch and then that's it.
I don't have,

825
00:54:58.991 --> 00:55:03.991
I don't have that much so I really don't watch that much TV TV anymore.

826
00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:09.620
And you know,
his shows on CNN.
Um,
but I've been,
you know,

827
00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:14.720
a long time fan of bore Danes and for me it started with kitchen confidence.

828
00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:18.420
That book is amazing.
The book is amazing and if you've never read it,

829
00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:21.510
and especially if you were already a fan of his and you're just like,
oh,

830
00:55:21.511 --> 00:55:24.630
I never got around to reading it,
read that book.
It really,

831
00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:27.030
I mean I remember when that book was a bestseller and I'm,

832
00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:31.550
I'm pretty much a skeptic on all forms.
I'll be like,

833
00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:35.100
Tuesdays with Morrie.
I'm like,
I don't want to fucking read that.
It's bullshit.

834
00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:38.840
Do the Oprah put him on,
does she put them on how that,
that,

835
00:55:38.841 --> 00:55:41.040
that catapulted him into the finale?

836
00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:46.470
She got Ahold of kitchen confidential and he had put these tips in there like

837
00:55:46.471 --> 00:55:50.160
don't order swordfish in a restaurant because of war and the days of the week.

838
00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:54.090
I remember all that stuff.
Food on a Sunday,
all his,
you know,

839
00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:59.120
if you watched him host no reservations or parts unknown on CNN or any other

840
00:56:00.271 --> 00:56:01.260
things,
you know,

841
00:56:01.261 --> 00:56:05.460
you realize that those voiceovers that he would do narrating the show were

842
00:56:05.461 --> 00:56:07.600
written or spoken.
We're in his word,

843
00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:13.120
write the copy and there's a really a poetic quality to the way that Bordain

844
00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:19.020
summarize things.
Describe things.
I mean he was,
he really was a gifted writer.

845
00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:21.150
Certainly a gifted writer,
you know,

846
00:56:21.151 --> 00:56:24.550
had a really original point of view on the world.

847
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:28.660
But if you don't know that book,
you're just watching it,
you're like,
you know,

848
00:56:28.661 --> 00:56:30.250
you might go like,
wow,
this guy is good at this.

849
00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:35.310
It's a whole other peek into his talent because he really wrote in such a poll.

850
00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:37.540
I mean it,

851
00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:41.080
it's kind of book where it makes you want to go out to a restaurant that night.

852
00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:44.380
It makes you want to be a chef,
makes you want to cook,
make and,

853
00:56:44.381 --> 00:56:48.250
and he had like that rock star and Paul.
Yeah.

854
00:56:48.251 --> 00:56:52.870
Punk quality.
What was great about kitchen confidential it?
Well first of all,

855
00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:53.711
uh,
you know,

856
00:56:53.711 --> 00:56:58.660
he had two failed novels before that he was writing mystery novels and they both

857
00:56:58.661 --> 00:56:59.140
failed.

858
00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:02.920
And then he got that old adage of like write what you now when he was like 40

859
00:57:02.921 --> 00:57:06.940
years old and he'd worked in the restaurant for wow.
So even older,
you know,

860
00:57:06.941 --> 00:57:10.990
he had a first wife,
no kids at the time.
And then he writes about what he knows,

861
00:57:10.991 --> 00:57:15.670
which is this the dark underbelly in the way that he writes it,
which is great.

862
00:57:15.671 --> 00:57:19.720
And what I really related to and I feel like creatively where I just,

863
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:23.320
I loved him.
It's that dark quality,

864
00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:28.300
that shadow self.
Um,
it's kind of why I love comedy because it's all the dark.

865
00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:32.020
It's the derelicts,
the masturbatory roundups the street people,

866
00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:34.040
they comedic sensibility to,
oh,

867
00:57:34.041 --> 00:57:38.760
it's great cause he's not writing it like he's not doing a fresh produce is one

868
00:57:38.761 --> 00:57:40.810
of the most important things to have in a restaurant,

869
00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:45.010
like a scumbag.
You know,
and he had,

870
00:57:45.011 --> 00:57:48.880
he had problems with addiction and heroin and he talks about that in that for

871
00:57:48.881 --> 00:57:52.870
the first book.
But,
um,
and by the way,
he did this is jumping around,

872
00:57:52.871 --> 00:57:56.320
but he did do a speaking in an evening with Anthony Bordain.

873
00:57:56.710 --> 00:58:01.180
He would do those tours where he would basically go out there and tell stories

874
00:58:01.330 --> 00:58:05.270
and it's basically,
he was basically doing standup.
Oh,
he was fine.

875
00:58:05.271 --> 00:58:06.700
It very funny guy.
Well,

876
00:58:06.701 --> 00:58:10.960
Joe Rogan interviewed him once on the Jerry and I remember listening to that and

877
00:58:10.961 --> 00:58:14.590
I just,
I loved him.
I just left.
I followed him on Instagram,
man,

878
00:58:14.591 --> 00:58:17.680
when he broke up with Octavia Bordain,
I was like,
this is great.

879
00:58:17.681 --> 00:58:20.260
It's finally my chance to get Anthony to hung out with them.

880
00:58:21.610 --> 00:58:24.600
I went to and I didn't do that.
Uh,

881
00:58:24.790 --> 00:58:28.900
but I did feel there is a kindred creative spirit there.

882
00:58:28.901 --> 00:58:32.020
And so I'm so upset cause I,
I just,
you know,

883
00:58:32.021 --> 00:58:35.020
cause especially all these fucking dumb chefs,
like you said,

884
00:58:35.021 --> 00:58:39.220
it's like Andrew Zimmern.
Not that he's bad,
but it's just like,
it's a difference.

885
00:58:39.221 --> 00:58:43.810
A different thing.
Yeah.
He was real,
Anthony had like a little bit of an edge,

886
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:47.320
a Lotta,
a lotta edge.
But I'm saying he had a little bit of that.

887
00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:50.350
He had that thing where if somebody you don't know,

888
00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:54.420
but you assume they would like you if you go,

889
00:58:54.550 --> 00:58:59.050
I would talk to him and we would click,
I would click with this.
Or You want him,

890
00:58:59.350 --> 00:59:02.590
you want to click,
I would be,
so I'm,

891
00:59:02.591 --> 00:59:06.100
I've had dreams the night he died.
I had a dream about him.

892
00:59:06.101 --> 00:59:10.120
Remember I told you I dreamt that we were in a New York City cafe and I was too

893
00:59:10.121 --> 00:59:13.480
afraid to go up to him because he's cooler than me.
And I was like,

894
00:59:13.481 --> 00:59:15.130
oh Anthony Bordain he's so cool.

895
00:59:15.131 --> 00:59:18.280
And that's how I've always felt like that guy's cool.
We're not,

896
00:59:18.490 --> 00:59:23.180
that guy's fucking cool.
And Yeah.
Anyways,

897
00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:26.150
bringing back drew because um,
they,

898
00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:30.710
they categorize this suicide as impulsive.
Right.
Which I was like,

899
00:59:30.711 --> 00:59:34.040
is that right?
Is that really how that works?

900
00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:36.260
Now I'm not obviously an expert and um,

901
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:41.330
but drew brought up a great point that this guy was essentially a heroin addict

902
00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:43.160
and left untreated,

903
00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:47.570
just kind of went from heroin to alcohol or workaholism or whatever.

904
00:59:47.571 --> 00:59:49.040
Like he would just fill that,

905
00:59:49.790 --> 00:59:52.580
that need with other things and he never went treated.

906
00:59:52.610 --> 00:59:57.610
It struck me before when I would just watch the show and seeing him enjoy and

907
01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:02.780
drink a bunch of different types of alcohol.

908
01:00:02.781 --> 01:00:05.990
He did IOWASCA on his first series,
I think,

909
01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:11.150
well that one strikes me reservations.
That's less of a thing in my mind.

910
01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:15.200
But to do a Alaska on your TV show is King nutty.
It's nutty.

911
01:00:15.201 --> 01:00:19.360
But I'm saying that all the times where I saw him enjoying booze,
man.
Yeah.

912
01:00:19.610 --> 01:00:24.610
I would think back to the book and think back to being a heroin addict and that

913
01:00:26.091 --> 01:00:31.091
he was doing the self imposed a medication of like why I'm leaving the hardcore

914
01:00:33.111 --> 01:00:36.620
thing,
but I'm going to,
I'm going to medicate with something else.
Yeah,
yeah.

915
01:00:36.621 --> 01:00:40.920
I mean I always thought that,
but you know,
you can never tell somebody I,

916
01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:44.560
and I guess there are some people where it works.
It works for them.
You know,

917
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:47.960
according to Dr Drew,
who's a,
an addiction specialist,

918
01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:53.530
anyone who's going from opiod addiction and not going clean,

919
01:00:54.291 --> 01:00:57.530
but like,
uh,
doing other supplementary,

920
01:00:58.070 --> 01:01:01.630
it's so you're just playing with fire the whole time.
It's super dangerous.
Well,

921
01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:06.640
he mentioned that TV show Patrick Melrose on showtime and I started to watch it

922
01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:09.870
and that's a pretty great represent.
It's,
that's what drew,

923
01:01:09.871 --> 01:01:13.730
he says it's a representation of somebody going from heroin to just booze to try

924
01:01:13.731 --> 01:01:18.140
to wean themselves off of heroin.
And it was so dark.
I couldn't,
I tapped out.

925
01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:22.560
Really?
Yeah.
And I was really into it because that guy,
um,
Cumberbatch,
yeah,

926
01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:27.060
Bennett fucked converge snatch.
He's a great actor.
It's a good rule.

927
01:01:27.090 --> 01:01:31.760
A nice way of saying his name.
Yeah.
But it was so dark and I thought,
Gosh,

928
01:01:31.761 --> 01:01:33.450
if Anthony Bordain uh,

929
01:01:33.451 --> 01:01:36.860
it was dealing with a fraction of the pain and suffering emotionally that this

930
01:01:36.861 --> 01:01:39.020
guy was no wonder,
you know,

931
01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.520
but I'm super bombed.
It really bummed me out.

932
01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:46.220
Made me sad,
you know?
I mean,

933
01:01:46.221 --> 01:01:51.221
I know a lot of people were talking about here's somebody that has it all and

934
01:01:51.381 --> 01:01:53.170
you know,
you see them just in,

935
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:58.670
in the fast lane of success and,

936
01:01:59.350 --> 01:02:04.250
and not only has it all but has it all their way.
We are like,
dude,

937
01:02:04.251 --> 01:02:09.251
you got to do it like you're doing the shore way you want to do you do you want

938
01:02:09.461 --> 01:02:14.330
to do,
yeah.
He's not like a,
you know,
stockbroker that hates the job.

939
01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:19.260
Right.
Or even like the morning show host,
fuck this job.
Yeah.

940
01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.540
He gets and he gives and he gives his real opinion.

941
01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:25.020
I used to love really love when I was watching no reservations back in the day a

942
01:02:25.021 --> 01:02:28.380
lot.
My favorite things were when he was,

943
01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:32.670
I think he was going to Greece one episode.
He was,

944
01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:36.240
I want to say he was like,
I fucking hate lamb.
Yeah.
You know,

945
01:02:36.790 --> 01:02:38.610
it's like I'm not looking for it.
I was like,
oh,

946
01:02:38.611 --> 01:02:42.720
this is so real that this guy is,
he's not,

947
01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:46.740
he respected all cultures,
you know,
and cause he would,
he would be like,

948
01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:52.560
I don't want to eat this.
I remember he ate some crazy into it meal.
He was like,

949
01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:58.340
yeah,
he was an art digest.
I loved that.
That he did too.

950
01:02:58.341 --> 01:03:00.750
It wasn't always like whatever anyone gives me,

951
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.850
I'll always say something positive.
He would tell you like,
I fucking hate lamb.

952
01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:08.580
It's not good.
I don't like that.
I don't like the way that was prepared.

953
01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:11.250
He hated vegetarianism.
He was very open.

954
01:03:11.251 --> 01:03:16.140
It was hilarious that he lives a carnivore and one time he went to Ghana and

955
01:03:16.141 --> 01:03:20.700
they fed him like a rodent and he was like,
this is fucking utterly disgusting.

956
01:03:20.701 --> 01:03:24.660
I'm forcing this down my throat right now basically.
And he was like,
I'm polite,

957
01:03:24.661 --> 01:03:25.950
but this is fucking dope.

958
01:03:25.951 --> 01:03:30.840
That's cool that that was a thing where you knew that he was being himself and

959
01:03:30.841 --> 01:03:35.790
you knew he wasn't just doing that polite thing of yeah,
it's all good.

960
01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:37.620
Everything's good.
Thank you.

961
01:03:37.621 --> 01:03:42.150
And talking down to foreigner or to foreign cultures and talking down to people

962
01:03:42.151 --> 01:03:46.530
and he would tell people this tastes like shit.
I love that about him.

963
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:49.620
He'll be missed deal.
Really good.
Missed.
I,

964
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:53.130
I've thought about them a lot since that happened.

965
01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:57.480
Know I felt like he's one of those guys that you feel like you really feel like

966
01:03:57.481 --> 01:04:00.420
you knew him well,
I think we,
you know?
Yeah.

967
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:02.970
And I think we had a few mutual acquaintances,

968
01:04:02.971 --> 01:04:07.650
people that had known him and I would hear things about in between all the shows

969
01:04:07.651 --> 01:04:11.880
and read.
I mean you obviously,
it's kind of like we knew him the way,
I dunno,

970
01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:14.670
like certain maybe listeners of this show know us,

971
01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:17.010
that you tap into something and then you,

972
01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:19.200
you get to know someone for a long time.

973
01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:24.840
I know it's in the Kate spade was few days.
Let's go with that one.
You guys.

974
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:26.580
I know.
It's crazy.

975
01:04:26.581 --> 01:04:30.300
Well on the good news is my shrink was telling me that a lot of people have been

976
01:04:30.301 --> 01:04:34.230
reaching out for therapy.
That's awesome.
These two suicides,
so that's good.

977
01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:38.550
I've definitely had messages like that and I always encourage people to reach

978
01:04:38.551 --> 01:04:40.080
out.
People reach out to me.

979
01:04:40.081 --> 01:04:43.320
I'm saying sometimes when they're like going through this depression,

980
01:04:43.321 --> 01:04:46.600
it's like always seek help,
please.
Yeah,
I,
cause I,

981
01:04:46.601 --> 01:04:50.250
I I keep googling Anthony bike was like obsessed with the story

982
01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:56.400
and it said that he did reach out to his doctor like a few a day or two before

983
01:04:56.430 --> 01:05:00.990
and uh,
just they said didn't take the advice that the doctor had given himself.

984
01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:02.250
Who knows what that means?

985
01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:06.920
I know a HBO is coming up with a new Robin Williams documentary.
No.

986
01:05:06.930 --> 01:05:10.290
Saw the trailer for it.
It's really,
it looked,
it looked amazing.

987
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:13.830
But I think what's so shocking with Anthony is that you didn't see that,

988
01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:17.010
oh well why didn't see Robin lambs coming?
But when you go,
well he was,

989
01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:19.550
he had some illness that he was dealing with,
right?
Yeah.

990
01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:20.990
<v 0>Robin was,
yes.
Yeah.</v>

991
01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:26.060
Ryan was dealing with like a serious early onset illness and the medication and

992
01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:30.190
he knew,
they basically had told them it was going to be,
you know,

993
01:05:30.191 --> 01:05:34.080
all downhill from here.
So he was like,
I'm out.
I think so.
Plus he'd,

994
01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:37.260
he'd suffered from depression for years and years.
Yeah.

995
01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:40.210
Kate spade and suffers from depression for years.

996
01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:40.631
<v 3>Right.</v>

997
01:05:40.631 --> 01:05:43.480
And she didn't want to seek treatment because she felt it would tarnish her

998
01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:46.470
brand,
which is so sad.
Like that.

999
01:05:46.471 --> 01:05:49.360
It's so sad that there's still a stigma on getting treatment.

1000
01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:52.660
It's for diverticulitis.
Okay.
Anyways,
guys,

1001
01:05:52.661 --> 01:05:55.450
I wanted to address it because I feel like it was an elephant.
Like,
oh,

1002
01:05:55.451 --> 01:05:56.820
at least you aren't going to talk about,

1003

Yeah,</v>

1021
01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:07.480
the water champ hat that was in our store for me sold out.
Okay.

1022
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:11.740
Had to be reordered and I was just messaged that we might have to reorder it

1023
01:07:11.741 --> 01:07:16.210
again.
Okay,
look,
first of all,
yours in abundance.
You're good there.

1024
01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:19.370
<v 3>Matt.
Matt Yanas let the record show.</v>

1025
01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:23.210
Let's look right now at the evidence.
I'm drinking water,

1026
01:07:23.211 --> 01:07:28.211
Fiji water courtesy of Martin Riza of the Patina restaurant in downtown La

1027
01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:34.220
Familia.
He brings us this wire.
So thank you Martin.
Uh,
I drank this.

1028
01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:35.360
And what are you drinking?

1029
01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:41.470
<v 0>A,
uh,
a venti ice coffee.
Extra ice.
No.
Sweet nurse Splash of whole milk.</v>

1030
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:42.910
It's mostly water.

1031
01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:45.200
<v 3>No,
it's not mostly water.
It's mostly Brown,</v>

1032
01:07:45.290 --> 01:07:47.930
which is what your urine looks like after you drink that.
Okay.

1033
01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:52.220
So one of us hydrates when it was dehydrates.
Not at the hydrating.

1034
01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:55.550
It is,
it's a stupid thing.
It's a stupid assumption that yes,

1035
01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:57.610
<v 0>it's a diuretic.</v>

1036
01:07:57.611 --> 01:08:02.611
So it makes you pee more stupid thing that stupid people say diuretic 63 years

1037
01:08:02.741 --> 01:08:04.570
ago today.
16.

1038
01:08:04.571 --> 01:08:08.740
It was born and it's important to note that stupid.

1039
01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:12.500
It's been a wonderful life.
Yeah.
I love you very much.
Let me to,

1040
01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:15.830
if you're born day,
it is to think that in

1041
01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:20.660
<v 3>few years you'll be collecting social security.
So crazy.
Really an amazing thing.</v>

1042
01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:24.380
Can you believe I'm 42 years old.
Wow.
That's fucking,

1043
01:08:24.381 --> 01:08:27.500
that's a lot of time to be honest with Bannon was tits.

1044
01:08:27.501 --> 01:08:31.910
I've been farming for a while.
It's a long time.

1045
01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:36.620
You're not even 40 yet.
That's so gross.
I know.
How does that make you feel?

1046
01:08:36.621 --> 01:08:41.000
It feels weird knowing how much you've been in your forties yeah,

1047
01:08:41.610 --> 01:08:46.610
like you keep being over 40 and I'm still,
what's it like now?

1048
01:08:46.611 --> 01:08:49.370
39 I'm 39 I can't wait for you to turn 40.

1049
01:08:49.371 --> 01:08:52.970
What are we going to do on the 40th fucking worst?
Let me tell you something.

1050
01:08:52.971 --> 01:08:57.320
You contemplate your life when you,
it's sad that midlife crisis shit is real.

1051
01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:59.240
You know,
I'm not a birthday party guy.

1052
01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:02.420
Not all thinking of having a birthday party.
I'm,

1053
01:09:03.010 --> 01:09:07.160
I'm opposed to the big birthday.
We talk about this a lot.

1054
01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:11.680
I don't understand these adults who are like,
it's my 47.

1055
01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:17.900
What do you,
I mean,
after 30 you don't get to do that shit.

1056
01:09:17.901 --> 01:09:21.110
Like you get the big ones.
30 40,
50,
60 but that's it.

1057
01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:24.140
Who gives a fuck about you and your birthday?
Like you,
you have a job,

1058
01:09:24.141 --> 01:09:28.160
you have a mortgage,
go on with your right.
Um,
well what do you want though?

1059
01:09:28.161 --> 01:09:31.140
But you and I both hate parties,
especially throwing them.
I know.

1060
01:09:31.790 --> 01:09:34.080
Maybe I'll do the big dinner,
a big dinner thing,

1061
01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:38.900
like an like we'll go to a nice restaurant with your friends.

1062
01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:43.190
Like the crushers.
No.
People are like,
oh man.

1063
01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:50.210
I mean maybe right.
I have some drinks.
Here's the problem with that.
Okay.

1064
01:09:50.290 --> 01:09:53.930
Yeah.
You only talked to two people sitting next to you and it's like,

1065
01:09:53.931 --> 01:09:57.940
what's the point of the big dinner?
What about the big dinner here?
You like Ha.

1066
01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:01.430
Like we feed people at our table.
That's a good idea.
You don't cook.

1067
01:10:01.431 --> 01:10:03.410
We have someone else cook.
It's a great idea.

1068
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:06.560
I think a small intimate party at your own home.

1069
01:10:06.561 --> 01:10:08.870
You can kind of control the variables.

1070
01:10:09.650 --> 01:10:12.890
That's nice and then I can get fucking shit.
Face fucking house,
Bro.

1071
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:16.910
Get ripped in half.
Can't wait till you're fucking ripped again man.
Man.

1072
01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:21.950
I've been sober for eight months.
This sucks.
I don't know how people do this.

1073
01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:29.300
I can't wait to get fucking drunk bro,
Bro.
I'm no Sushi and wine.

1074
01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:32.420
First thing when they pop this kid out,
dude,
that's what I want.

1075
01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:35.390
Bring me the wine and bring me to Sushi.

1076
01:10:35.391 --> 01:10:36.710
I don't give a fuck if I'm breastfeeding.

1077
01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:41.720
Email doesn't come in for fucking two or three days anyways,
bro.
Bring it.

1078
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:44.720
That's pretty cool.
What are you going to do?

1079
01:10:44.721 --> 01:10:48.980
You're going to do something like you're going to go to Colorado with Burton Ari

1080
01:10:48.981 --> 01:10:53.660
and watch some Grand Prix race or something.
Fucking dude thing like that.

1081
01:10:53.661 --> 01:10:55.190
And my birthday for your 40th.
Yeah.

1082
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:59.630
You're gonna like go horseback riding with Joe or something.

1083
01:10:59.650 --> 01:11:03.770
Why you always talking about your horseback riding thing?

1084
01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:08.860
You literally described the last thing on earth I know is terrible.

1085
01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:13.920
No,
I won't do that.
I will.
I don't know.
You know?
I don't know.

1086
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:17.940
<v 0>I really don't know.
I liked so far I like the dinner idea.
Yeah.</v>

1087
01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:20.520
Like a nice dinner.
Yeah.
I like that too.

1088
01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:25.830
And got to bring in the people you really liked out.
See that's it.
The key to it.

1089
01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:29.940
Yeah.
See a party has too many,
um,
you know,

1090
01:11:30.270 --> 01:11:34.440
fringe kind of on the outsiders and the cause the party.

1091
01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:37.350
People always find that when you're like,
I don't want this,
do it in my party.

1092
01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:40.570
You want them at your party and you're not really talking to them anyways,

1093
01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:44.130
but the dinner,
you can make it smaller.
You can make it exactly how you want.

1094
01:11:44.490 --> 01:11:48.600
I like it.
I like it too.
God,
I fucking hate birthdays.
You know what I hate?

1095
01:11:48.601 --> 01:11:52.290
I hate getting all the text messages and the met like happy birthday and you're

1096
01:11:52.291 --> 01:11:56.140
like,
oh,
I want to,
I think I would do the,
uh,
the birth.

1097
01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:01.940
That's good.
We don't cook.
I don't want to cook.
I don't want to clean up.
No,

1098
01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:07.140
you have somebody else do all of that.
Um,
yeah,
I hate birthdays.
I hate,

1099
01:12:07.141 --> 01:12:10.560
I hate the in between birthdays like this one,
like 42.
Like who gives a shit?

1100
01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:15.210
Nobody fucking cares.
Have you go,
you know,
I can't work.

1101
01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:17.960
I'm still gonna fucking do I care.
Yeah.

1102
01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:24.270
So why know how much you love people screaming and how it makes you laugh.
Um,

1103
01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:28.920
there's a guy apparently goes all over the world.
Coyote Peterson,

1104
01:12:28.921 --> 01:12:33.921
I think is his name and he likes to find like the most painful bites and stings.

1105
01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:40.500
Any films himself going through it.
Oh my God.
It's really crazy

1106
01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:45.120
<v 14>how to say that the sting of the trench will hawk is number two and the insect</v>

1107
01:12:45.130 --> 01:12:46.250
sting pain index.

1108
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:50.810
It's like being stunned with a Taser and they say it puts you into a state of

1109
01:12:50.811 --> 01:12:55.040
paralysis for up to five minutes where all you can do is scream.

1110
01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:57.680
You're going to do this yourself.
Yeah.
To himself.

1111
01:12:58.010 --> 01:13:00.610
Does he have the antidote with him?
There's no antidote because it's not me.

1112
01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:03.590
I know.
It's just painful staying mealy mouth.
Second.

1113
01:13:03.710 --> 01:13:07.520
This is the most nervous I've ever is.
Basically fear factor bite from anything.

1114
01:13:07.670 --> 01:13:10.310
My hand is shaking.
Selfimposed yes.
Already.

1115
01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:14.160
<v 0>What a fucking idiot.
Ready?
Yeah.
Here we go.</v>

1116
01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:19.500
<v 14>I'm Katie Peterson and I'm about to enter the stings zone with the Tarantula</v>

1117
01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:20.853
Hawk.

1118
01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:24.800
<v 5>That's just a stinger,
but it's really,
don't do I browse on to it too.</v>

1119
01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:26.653
Here we go.

1120
01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:33.380
<v 0>Oh No.
Oh No,
don't do,
it's like forcing a steam.
Yeah.</v>

1121
01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:51.790
<v 5>Oh my gosh.
You're not laughing,
Tom.
Oh,
why aren't you laughing?</v>

1122
01:13:57.330 --> 01:14:01.930
<v 14>I hope our kids never do shit like this,
man.
I did it though.
Self.
She was crazy.</v>

1123
01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:12.010
<v 5>This is not good
and this won't</v>

1124
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:15.760
<v 6>kill you.
That was the most intense pain I've ever felt.</v>

1125
01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:17.760
The gag and talk

1126
01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:29.140
to you after the hotline show in the toilet.

1127
01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:32.710
My diarrhea,
I just can't move my arm.

1128
01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:38.680
Why is he doing this?
This is for television or just the answer,
right?

1129
01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:41.620
Just for youtube views.

1130
01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:43.263
<v 3>A lot of views.</v>

1131
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.060
<v 6>Yeah.
Your arm is swollen up.</v>

1132
01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:50.620
A second wave of pain.

1133
01:14:53.150 --> 01:14:54.760
I say you don't have to do this.

1134
01:14:58.990 --> 01:15:02.080
It's actually seen it.
Get this part.
Do it again.
Oh,

1135
01:15:03.730 --> 01:15:06.940
I've read that.
It's like getting tased with a Taser gun.

1136
01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:08.710
I've never been tased before,

1137
01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:13.190
but I can tell you that the pain is unbelievable right now.
You to

1138
01:15:13.190 --> 01:15:16.310
<v 3>go get ticked off and on my forum so you can compare it.
I agree.</v>

1139
01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:21.350
There's that video.
Yeah.
You guys at least go all the way.

1140
01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:27.150
Fuck man.
I don't like that.
Yeah.
How can we,

1141
01:15:27.151 --> 01:15:29.720
I laughing.
I feel like you would laugh at it.
I don't know what,

1142
01:15:29.721 --> 01:15:32.690
why aren't you laughing?
I think cause he like,
we know it's coming.

1143
01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:37.220
I think the surprise would have been better if you just saw the guy put the bug

1144
01:15:37.221 --> 01:15:39.220
on his arm and not say what's going to happen.

1145
01:15:39.221 --> 01:15:43.790
Like if his friend had put the bug on his arm.
Oh,
and then that you're right.

1146
01:15:43.791 --> 01:15:47.570
That's a funnier setup.
That's a funny or setup sure.
Than him just being like,

1147
01:15:47.571 --> 01:15:49.520
I'm going to do this to myself.
Right.

1148
01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:53.810
And then he really looked like he was in real pain.
Yeah.
He's also,

1149
01:15:53.811 --> 01:15:56.090
it's prolonged on some of these things,

1150
01:15:56.450 --> 01:16:01.040
like the guy jumping off the tow truck,
it's quick,
you know,

1151
01:16:01.041 --> 01:16:04.670
it's just like,
and then it's over.
This is like you're seeing someone suffer,

1152
01:16:05.150 --> 01:16:09.440
which I thought would be in your wheelhouse.
Nah,
I don't like that so much.
Um,

1153
01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:13.700
I like it if like a guy friend,
like a jackass set up,
we're like,

1154
01:16:14.030 --> 01:16:18.710
maybe Johnny Knoxville dumps that bug down like someone's shorts and they get a

1155
01:16:18.711 --> 01:16:22.040
bite on there,
Peter or their balls.
Now that's a funnier scenario.

1156
01:16:22.130 --> 01:16:25.700
Or like if one of those guys is sleeping and they let that thing,
oh shit,

1157
01:16:27.210 --> 01:16:29.750
God,
they should've submitted this a jackass and that would have been,

1158
01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:33.230
that's a good one.
That would have been a good thing.
Here's a double pipe,

1159
01:16:33.231 --> 01:16:35.420
classic loophole question.
Oh,
interesting.

1160
01:16:35.450 --> 01:16:38.210
I was talking to my wife the other night about double pipe classics and I had an

1161
01:16:38.211 --> 01:16:43.211
epiphany if Tom were to bit to Burp and Christina's how you say asshole and then

1162
01:16:44.121 --> 01:16:47.930
Christina,
where to fart that burp out.
Would that technically be a five classic?

1163
01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:52.640
Just wondering,
try it out.
Love you.
Mommy's Jr.
Um,
no,

1164
01:16:52.641 --> 01:16:55.190
that would not be,
but I really liked the way your mind works.

1165
01:16:56.910 --> 01:16:58.040
You're uh,

1166
01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:02.300
definitely grows and you're really using your time for good.

1167
01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:05.270
But I don't think that works.
It's thought provoking.

1168
01:17:05.271 --> 01:17:08.990
I burp into your asshole and you fart that out.
I mean,
I get what he's saying.

1169
01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:13.460
Like it is a technical loop and a Fart,
but it's not the same thing.
Well,
no,

1170
01:17:13.461 --> 01:17:16.460
here's why it's a DQ.
Yeah.
First of all,

1171
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:20.000
the double pipe classic is a burp comes out of your mouth,
your mouth,

1172
01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:24.860
and far it comes out of your rack down.
At the same time,
he's saying,

1173
01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:27.530
you're going to burp into my rectum.

1174
01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:30.720
And so the that my rectum is just full of your burp air.
I know.

1175
01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:34.640
And that actually is [inaudible] it's improper saying there's a burp.

1176
01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:37.100
That's a fart.
I understand what he's saying,

1177
01:17:37.101 --> 01:17:41.450
but the definition of a double pipe is that you're burping out of your mouth and

1178
01:17:41.451 --> 01:17:44.710
farting out of your anus at the same time.
So it's,

1179
01:17:45.090 --> 01:17:49.400
it's not even a,
it's an,
it's a nonstarter guy.
This is not even a loophole.

1180
01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:51.800
It's not,
it's,
it's illogical.
What you're,

1181
01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:55.370
what you're suggesting is it's a logical,
it's not right.

1182
01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:59.790
Somebody writes us,
hey genes.
Recently I was giving my girlfriend a back rub.

1183
01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:04.370
We had just had sex and we were still naked,
so it was sitting on top of her.

1184
01:18:04.371 --> 01:18:08.660
But with our bare butt touching,
I didn't think much of it,

1185
01:18:08.661 --> 01:18:10.820
but I had to Fart and I ripped a loud one,

1186
01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:14.060
which ended up going directly into her butthole.
No,

1187
01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:17.840
she was not a fan of the sensation of the wind and particles going into her

1188
01:18:17.841 --> 01:18:21.500
rectum.
Is there a name for this or some people into this?

1189
01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:24.560
Did I accidentally discover a new fart fetish?

1190
01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:29.570
I just wanted some gene's opinion on this.
Sincerely.
Zinzer um,

1191
01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:32.960
well Zim,
I think you are nasty as hell.

1192
01:18:33.970 --> 01:18:35.630
You mean you wouldn't even do this to me?

1193
01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:39.740
Sit on you and Fart into your butthole.
It's not,

1194
01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:43.450
it's not what I'm,
I don't think it wasn't as yoga.

1195
01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:46.130
I don't think.
And I understand what he's saying.

1196
01:18:46.131 --> 01:18:48.320
He signed someone's butt and then you fart on there.
But,

1197
01:18:48.710 --> 01:18:52.160
but in order for that far to go into somebody's butt hole,

1198
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:54.860
you're buttholes clenched shut.

1199
01:18:55.250 --> 01:18:59.030
So I don't think that the FARC can go into her butthole unless her name.

1200
01:18:59.690 --> 01:19:03.770
Of course.
No,
of course this is,
he just farted on her butt.
Right.

1201
01:19:03.771 --> 01:19:07.910
So that's just bad luck for her.
It is.
Is it,
are some people into it?

1202
01:19:07.911 --> 01:19:09.740
I'm sure somebody out there is like,

1203
01:19:09.741 --> 01:19:12.890
I love when somebody just farts on me on my butt cheeks.

1204
01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:17.330
But if that were to go in and there'll be a fart transfer,
that's not happening.

1205
01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:21.920
But fart transport transfer students.

1206
01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:25.580
It's not how it's not happening.
It's not pie.
It is possible,
but it's just not.

1207
01:19:25.581 --> 01:19:25.940
You could,

1208
01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:30.620
you could put a funnel in her butthole and then fart into the funnel and maybe

1209
01:19:30.621 --> 01:19:33.110
some of those fart particles will go into her best hall.

1210
01:19:33.111 --> 01:19:38.111
Such another level of commitment to that to Fart into a funnel and put it in

1211
01:19:38.301 --> 01:19:42.290
someone's asshole.
I mean it's not like an accidental thing that just happens.

1212
01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:45.170
You're really,
really going forward at that point.

1213
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:47.630
That's what he's suggesting that he's done,

1214
01:19:48.170 --> 01:19:50.830
but without the funnel and that's not possible.
I'm saying it's not.

1215
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:55.640
You see the White House video,
did you see?

1216
01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:58.670
Yes.
You did see it.
Depressing.
Guess you showed this to me.

1217
01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:01.000
I thought I've sowed you just like a moment of it.
I,

1218
01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:06.080
it's so disturbing and alarming.
The White House put out.
This is so crazy.

1219
01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:08.040
It's so now you're just gonna

1220
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.510
<v 0>upset me all over again cause it's so embarrassing that this is our leader or</v>

1221
01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:13.740
putting out this nonsense.
It's,

1222
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:19.070
it's so funny that this is actually real because when I saw it I was like,

1223
01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:22.290
there's no way this is real and it is real.

1224
01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:26.670
Here's the best part about this for people that don't know what I'm about to

1225
01:20:26.671 --> 01:20:31.671
show you was played for the journalists at the summit in Singapore after Trump

1226
01:20:35.610 --> 01:20:38.040
and Kim Jong Un met this,

1227
01:20:38.041 --> 01:20:42.750
played on large screens for the journalists and then from blocked out and did

1228
01:20:42.751 --> 01:20:47.430
his press conference.
So great.
It really feels like a sketch when you see this.

1229
01:20:47.730 --> 01:20:49.230
But here's what we learned afterwards.

1230
01:20:49.770 --> 01:20:54.480
Trump actually showed this kick to Kim Jong at lunch.
He showed them this video,

1231
01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:58.230
which you knew he had to be like,
you want to see some,

1232
01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:01.200
we want to see some bad ass shit.
Let's see some cool stuff.
Yeah.

1233
01:21:01.201 --> 01:21:04.230
And then Kim turned to his translator was like,
Huh.

1234
01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:08.370
And the translator was like sort of the hell he was Japanese.

1235
01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:11.460
And then he goes like nod and like,
yeah,
we'll see some cool shit.

1236
01:21:12.030 --> 01:21:15.390
And then Trump showed him this and was like,
what?
Well you think?

1237
01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:18.660
And then Kim Jong Il was probably like set it the home depot,

1238
01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:21.660
which means like he said that some bad ass shit.

1239
01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:26.090
Like I bet you that's not far off from some

1240
01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:28.930
<v 6>7 billion</v>

1241
01:21:31.630 --> 01:21:33.100
of those alive today.

1242
01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:38.350
Only a small number will leave a lasting impact it feels like and only the very

1243
01:21:38.351 --> 01:21:43.351
few will make decisions or take actions that would match their homeland and

1244
01:21:43.601 --> 01:21:45.370
change the course of history.

1245
01:21:47.170 --> 01:21:49.690
History may appear to repeat itself for generation.

1246
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:52.330
<v 0>The crazy thing is I fear the White House.</v>

1247
01:21:52.331 --> 01:21:56.830
You have to have access to like the best producers,

1248
01:21:56.831 --> 01:22:00.970
editors you can reach and it was clearly made by,
you know,

1249
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.350
corporate like this is corporate creativity.
If uh,

1250
01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:07.160
you know,
yeah,

1251
01:22:07.630 --> 01:22:12.610
if fucking in a world it just feels very generic.

1252
01:22:12.611 --> 01:22:17.110
It feels generic.
It's generic editing.
It's generic voiceover as generic music.

1253
01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:19.930
It just feels like there was,
I don't know,

1254
01:22:19.931 --> 01:22:23.110
like a shopping cart company would be like,
Hey,

1255
01:22:23.111 --> 01:22:26.350
we have a new shopping cart coming out.
Can you guys make a video?

1256
01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:30.910
This would be the type of video while you're not even getting to the good parts

1257
01:22:30.911 --> 01:22:33.820
yet.
No,
I know.
This is,
it gets better and better.

1258
01:22:36.590 --> 01:22:37.950
<v 6>Only a few</v>

1259
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:45.650
difference
difference.

1260
01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:50.510
It doesn't have to be the future

1261
01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:59.040
that share a common and rich heritage can find a common future.

1262
01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:03.880
Destiny pictures presents a story.

1263
01:23:04.810 --> 01:23:06.470
<v 0>Fuck is happening.</v>

1264
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:10.930
<v 6>Destiny pictures presents.
You've heard of destiny pictures,
right?</v>

1265
01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:13.570
So clearly this is,
you know,
you can sit in,
right?

1266
01:23:13.571 --> 01:23:17.200
You can see like the White House we didn't,
they're like,
wow,
it's a fig trailer.

1267
01:23:18.270 --> 01:23:21.320
You know it's our destiny to have this come together.
And he's like,
that's it.

1268
01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:25.300
Destiny pictures presents.
I get like,

1269
01:23:25.301 --> 01:23:27.640
it's like a movie that's really going to happen.
Yeah,

1270
01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:33.190
but make it like super bad ass.
Like all kinds of cool shots there can only be

1271
01:23:36.690 --> 01:23:37.523
moving back.

1272
01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:41.620
<v 0>Be Explosions in this video.
Tom.</v>

1273
01:23:47.250 --> 01:23:50.950
<v 6>Oh wait.
I think in destiny pictures.
I forgot this.</v>

1274
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:54.840
Watch two man.

1275
01:23:57.510 --> 01:24:01.850
Justin
time.

1276
01:24:02.650 --> 01:24:07.210
When a man is presented with one chant that may never be there.
It is.

1277
01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:09.700
What release you to show vision

1278
01:24:09.890 --> 01:24:14.570
<v 0>stock footage of the guide dunking.
That's my favorite thing ever.</v>

1279
01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:17.180
It's hey,
can you get a guy to dunk

1280
01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:22.030
<v 6>in the video?
The science,
science medicals</v>

1281
01:24:24.450 --> 01:24:25.820
<v 0>loves basketball.
Yeah,
no,</v>

1282
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:30.300
I know Dennis Rodman or one of moving forward

1283
01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:37.501
is launching.

1284
01:24:37.501 --> 01:24:42.501
For those of you that don't know why this is absolutely fucking but Nana's do a

1285
01:24:43.981 --> 01:24:48.981
little bit of research into diplomacy in a way that it's approached.

1286
01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:51.820
Um,

1287
01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:57.140
tech create a fake movie trailer that you actually released to the general

1288
01:24:58.351 --> 01:25:03.351
public and play for journalists and play for the,

1289
01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:08.250
uh,
isolated dictator of country.
It's fucking crazy,
man.

1290
01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:11.430
It's crazy.
This is,
this is,
uh,

1291
01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:15.960
it's definitely not how things have been done,
but you know,

1292
01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:19.140
I guess we'll hold out are

1293
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.460
embarrassing.
Like it's so embarrassing.
I know.
It's so amazing.

1294
01:25:25.490 --> 01:25:27.630
I can't even bring myself to have an opinion.

1295
01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:32.730
You ever get like you're some subset inside today.
Oh my God.

1296
01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:36.810
Somebody was telling me like this and this feel like a stupid,

1297
01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:40.940
it feels like Scientology videos.
One of,
yeah,

1298
01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:46.270
<v 6>Ken history,
we changed,
moves the world,</v>

1299
01:25:46.330 --> 01:25:49.720
embrace this change and when could this moment in history

1300
01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:59.280
and enjoy prosperity like he has never seen or more isolation.

1301
01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:04.243
We chose

1302
01:26:05.210 --> 01:26:08.840
<v 3>so wild
little levity.</v>

1303
01:26:09.250 --> 01:26:13.800
It's so crazy.
It's so fucking nasty.
I,
I'm not,
I can't even,

1304
01:26:14.410 --> 01:26:18.170
I think that it's not just that video,
it's the source of the video.

1305
01:26:18.650 --> 01:26:23.570
That's amazing.
And where the video was played.
Yeah.
It's so inappropriate.
Oh,

1306
01:26:23.571 --> 01:26:24.290
you know what's,

1307
01:26:24.290 --> 01:26:28.010
what it reminds me of is when you see somebody make like an independent film,

1308
01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:32.390
like their own film and then they're like,
Hey,
look at this movie I made

1309
01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:35.660
cringey.
Right.
Yeah.

1310
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:40.990
And then they send you the trailer that they made on their apple computer and

1311
01:26:41.511 --> 01:26:46.220
that's what that is.
It's,
it's like the Steven Seagal movies that we,

1312
01:26:46.330 --> 01:26:49.770
we watch sometimes Sunday.
It's exactly like

1313
01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:56.540
that.
Looks like a single trailer.
It's so cheap.

1314
01:26:57.010 --> 01:27:01.040
Asia and America collide.
It looks terrible.

1315
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:06.420
Terrible fucking make the trailer incredible.
Yeah.

1316
01:27:06.421 --> 01:27:09.230
You know,
people in Showbiz might,
there's people that support you,

1317
01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:15.020
find it fine.
Like put kid rock in the video.
He loves you.

1318
01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:22.180
Yeah.
If it was like North Korea,
do the right thing,
whatever.
Or you know,

1319
01:27:22.181 --> 01:27:27.090
have the celebrities endorsing you that,
that,
like you said,
it's been nice.

1320
01:27:27.170 --> 01:27:29.030
It's just utter nonsense.

1321
01:27:32.690 --> 01:27:36.560
What's really interesting though is that Dennis Rodman is saying that like he

1322
01:27:36.561 --> 01:27:41.210
was the first to coin.com that's the shirt.
He wore it on the news,

1323
01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:44.210
but he's,
he's taking credit for this.
He's like,
look dude,

1324
01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:48.440
I was the first person to go to North Korea and establish contact,
and you guys,

1325
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:51.350
you motherfuckers tell me,
he kind of does.

1326
01:27:51.351 --> 01:27:54.590
Like when did Dennis Rodman become the voice of reason in the world?

1327
01:27:54.750 --> 01:27:58.330
This world that we live in now?
That makes a lot of sense.
We live in it.

1328
01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:04.880
Everything that you thought made sense.
I mean,
even the video being played,

1329
01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:09.680
it's like,
it's one of those
thing fucking,

1330
01:28:09.681 --> 01:28:14.050
when people send,
Hey,
I did stand up for the first time.
No,
don't do that,

1331
01:28:14.051 --> 01:28:18.770
and you watch it.
I'm like,
fuck no.
God dammit.
Here's another,

1332
01:28:18.771 --> 01:28:20.780
here's a tip for you.
If you really want to get into stand up,

1333
01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:26.050
don't post the first time you've done stand up or the first seven years of doing

1334
01:28:28.190 --> 01:28:31.790
any of that stuff.
Guys,
it's not good.
It's not good.
You're not good at it.

1335
01:28:32.570 --> 01:28:36.710
It's terrible.
It's bad.
And if you think it's good,
you're wrong,
it's not good,

1336
01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:41.420
you're not good at it.
Well,
and also I understand the,
I know you want to share,

1337
01:28:41.421 --> 01:28:43.700
you want validation to be fair,

1338
01:28:43.701 --> 01:28:46.490
I understand a younger comedian might want your feedback,

1339
01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:51.600
but on the other hand though,
so what,

1340
01:28:51.610 --> 01:28:54.350
like that's just how you would you stand up.
You're just telling this person,
hey,

1341
01:28:54.351 --> 01:28:58.540
this is how I would do it.
You know what I'm saying?
It's not really guidance

1342
01:29:01.050 --> 01:29:04.740
about it,
but you definitely shouldn't post it.
Don't post it.

1343
01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:06.291
Don't post years.

1344
01:29:06.291 --> 01:29:11.291
Stand up for a long time posted when it's been really like test it out and yeah,

1345
01:29:12.570 --> 01:29:15.600
you've done it to a lot of audiences and then you go like,
hey.

1346
01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:19.550
Unless you're like,
oh,
I just did it for a laugh like I,
I did it for.

1347
01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:24.000
But if you're like,
I'm pursuing standup,
believe me when I tell you,

1348
01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:28.340
you don't want that to be a representation of,
you know,

1349
01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:33.060
think about standups that you really like and admire.
What do you see of them?

1350
01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:37.050
You see a finished product,
you see something that's 10 years at least.

1351
01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:38.220
So you're like,
yeah,

1352
01:29:38.221 --> 01:29:41.970
I've been uploading a all my sets on youtube if you want to watch him.
I said,

1353
01:29:42.270 --> 01:29:46.950
dude,
you shouldn't.
Well,
and I remember being frustrated when I was a,
excuse me,

1354
01:29:46.951 --> 01:29:50.640
50 or comic or fourth year comic.
It'd be like,
why aren't I in the clubs?

1355
01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:54.660
Why aren't I?
Yeah.
And I didn't know at the time,
but I sucked.
That's why.

1356
01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:59.160
And the,
when you get good enough,
people will take notice.

1357
01:29:59.161 --> 01:30:01.290
You don't have to do much.
Once you're good,

1358
01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:05.070
they'll invite you to do the shows that you want to be doing.
Don't worry.

1359
01:30:05.071 --> 01:30:08.160
Don't push it.
No,
I know.
It takes time.
It just,
there's no short time.

1360
01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:11.670
Those videos are so cringy when they're,
when they're,
oh,
it's,
I won't,

1361
01:30:11.671 --> 01:30:15.960
I won't watch them.
Oh my God.
No.
People submit them to me and I politely decline.

1362
01:30:15.961 --> 01:30:18.900
I say,
look,
I,
I,
I just don't think,

1363
01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:22.410
I don't want to derail you from your creative journey.
I totally agree.

1364
01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:25.050
What if I say something and I discouraged?
I hate.

1365
01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:27.900
And that ends up being your thing that makes you an,

1366
01:30:27.901 --> 01:30:30.390
I told you to stop doing that because I wouldn't do that.

1367
01:30:30.530 --> 01:30:34.770
Personalizing hate giving standup notes and I don't like it either.

1368
01:30:34.771 --> 01:30:39.180
I won't one on one.
Only critiquing.
It's like,
who am I?
Who am I to tell you what,

1369
01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:43.500
what you think is right.
I know I don't like it.
I don't like,
I don't like,

1370
01:30:43.501 --> 01:30:47.670
I'm putting a thought in your head that maybe changes another thought that you

1371
01:30:47.671 --> 01:30:51.120
had that maybe it was a good thought just because I think it,

1372
01:30:51.150 --> 01:30:54.900
but I still don't want to watch your awful video.
How'd you are?

1373
01:30:55.410 --> 01:30:59.640
Please don't send me your videos.
No,
fucking God.

1374
01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:01.673
It's really,

1375
01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:03.693
<v 1>Oh,</v>

1376
01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:07.000
<v 3>do you know Gucci Barry?
No.
He's this,
this guy.</v>

1377
01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:10.730
<v 1>So today is going to look up.
We thought we'd do Americans.</v>

1378
01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:15.360
Maybe we're doing a show right now.
A little leaguer.
Swing really nuts.

1379
01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:18.520
<v 3>What are you doing on your phone,
man?
Uh,</v>

1380
01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:22.100
my food is arriving and I would like to know whether or not Claudia opened the

1381
01:31:22.101 --> 01:31:24.530
door for this person because they're calling me.
Okay,
well,

1382
01:31:24.531 --> 01:31:26.420
we're in the middle of this podcast.
I know.
Okay.

1383
01:31:26.421 --> 01:31:29.330
So then they'll just send my food away.
I'm pregnant and I got to eat.
All right.

1384
01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:33.950
You want me to suck it up again?
Oh sure.
Yeah.
Okay.

1385
01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:36.060
<v 1>Yeah.
So today a swing to the fact,</v>

1386
01:31:36.061 --> 01:31:39.710
Sunday we thought we'd do America's favorite pastime.
Baseball.

1387
01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:42.210
We're going to let this little leaguer swing really nuts.

1388
01:31:44.630 --> 01:31:47.240
Can I keep the Green Slam your nothing to add.

1389
01:31:49.580 --> 01:31:53.170
Ah,
ah,

1390
01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:55.440
ah.

1391
01:31:56.150 --> 01:32:00.070
<v 3>See I've really discovered about myself just in this episode and I don't</v>

1392
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:04.060
<v 0>like when it's like planned out and anticipate it as much.</v>

1393
01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:05.860
I liked the accidental.

1394
01:32:06.010 --> 01:32:09.480
<v 3>That's interesting.
You like the element of surprise.
Yeah.
I don't like,</v>

1395
01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:10.790
I don't like this.
If it,

1396
01:32:10.791 --> 01:32:14.910
all he would've had to done is just show you this video without the setup and

1397
01:32:14.911 --> 01:32:16.460
then you would have laughed.
Maybe.

1398
01:32:16.610 --> 01:32:19.670
<v 0>Maybe I,
I don't,
I won't know now,
but I definitely don't like it.</v>

1399
01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:21.170
I don't like it either.

1400
01:32:21.170 --> 01:32:25.400
And too much of my memory goes to having my balls.

1401
01:32:25.650 --> 01:32:25.850
<v 3>No,</v>

1402
01:32:25.850 --> 01:32:30.140
I think you've got something there because America's funniest home videos made

1403
01:32:30.141 --> 01:32:33.920
several seasons of that show.
Just on this premise.
It's the nut hit.
Right.

1404
01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:37.340
And the reason the nut hit worked is because it wasn't deliberate.

1405
01:32:37.370 --> 01:32:39.680
It was the accidental kids swinging.
Yeah.

1406
01:32:40.010 --> 01:32:44.300
It's the mom doing whatever asked the kid is they hit him in the balls with a

1407
01:32:44.301 --> 01:32:47.930
fucking baseball bat.
Yeah.
It doesn't work when it's deliberate,

1408
01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:52.180
unless it's jackass.
And there's a group of guys laughing.
Yeah.
You know,

1409
01:32:52.190 --> 01:32:56.450
and there's like some stakes or they've agreed to it.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1410
01:32:56.940 --> 01:33:00.020
<v 1>Ah Ha ha ha ha.
Oh</v>

1411
01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:06.110
fuck me.
Ah,
God damn it.

1412
01:33:06.930 --> 01:33:08.220
<v 0>What's going on with this guy?
You think?</v>

1413
01:33:08.370 --> 01:33:12.160
<v 1>Oh,
I got high ground flat on in there.</v>

1414
01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:18.070
Oh,
he needs attention.
We'll whole,
Oh

1415
01:33:23.070 --> 01:33:23.420
yeah.

1416
01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:27.020
<v 3>I know.
I do works on Jackass though because the other guy's laughing.</v>

1417
01:33:27.021 --> 01:33:30.770
Give you permission to laugh.
Yeah,
that's true.
And you know that it's okay.

1418
01:33:30.771 --> 01:33:35.080
And you know that whoever gets hurt,
first of all,

1419
01:33:35.081 --> 01:33:37.470
I was okay with it.
Yeah,
they've sent,

1420
01:33:37.570 --> 01:33:39.980
you also know he's going to get somebody back.
My,

1421
01:33:39.981 --> 01:33:43.760
there's a bunch of goofballs doing it,
but this one just felt sad.

1422
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:48.470
<v 0>Oof.
Jesus Christ aesthetic.
Um,</v>

1423
01:33:48.770 --> 01:33:51.170

1436
01:34:42.501 --> 01:34:45.020
