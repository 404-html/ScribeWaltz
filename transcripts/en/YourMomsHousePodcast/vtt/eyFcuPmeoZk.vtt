1
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.290
Well.
Well,
well go to your mom's house,

2
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.413
Christina.

3
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.210
<v 0>All right.
We did a bunch of stuff.
Now we're back from the zip code one.</v>

4
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.570
Is that,
what was that about?
We took a break.

5
00:00:25.571 --> 00:00:30.180
We had do stuff and then there's other stuff to do.
Okay.
All right.
Yeah,

6
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.270
I'm glad to be here.
I missed you.
I miss you.
You were gone.
You went to Fart next.

7
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.900
I did the second to last stop on this tour and then we're going to Hawaii

8
00:00:41.201 --> 00:00:45.340
tomorrow hub.
I know.

9
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.840
What are you going to do on your vacay?
Take it easy.
Vape,
drink.

10
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.150
Just chill.
Are you going to be one of those dads?

11
00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:54.730
It's at the bar at 10:00 AM when it opens.
Why shouldn't I be?

12
00:00:54.731 --> 00:00:58.960
I'm celebrating the year.
The year's over.
That always amazes me.

13
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.470
Those people are like,
look,
everyone does their thing on vacation,

14
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.340
but that to me is like real endurance.
The people that like,

15
00:01:06.341 --> 00:01:10.690
I'm just saying like a Bert Kreischer maybe you know at the bar when it opens

16
00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:14.710
10:00 AM until Sunday
full day,

17
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.970
it's going to be a member.
Those dads and the Dominican Republic.

18
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:21.310
When we went there and they found out we had a porno channel and they were like,

19
00:01:21.311 --> 00:01:24.670
what?
Yeah,
there so gels and they were eyeballing the,
uh,

20
00:01:24.671 --> 00:01:28.540
the girl that was taken her photos.
Oh yeah.
Cute young girl.
And he was like,

21
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.530
check out.
Hey,
get over here.
Bob Cared.
They were like really dad and down on her.

22
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.520
So sad.
When you become a dad.
Yeah.
Do you feel sad yet?
Yeah,
of course.

23
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.420
Does that dad sadness open?
Oh yeah.
It's coming out of my pores.

24
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.430
What is the dad sadness about?

25
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.840
Just realize that funds over responsibility.
Yeah.

26
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.860
Now you got to like make sure everyone's okay and make sure lights are on food

27
00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:56.830
in the house.
Just sad.
Yeah.
Mom's sadness is there too where you're like,
oh,

28
00:01:56.831 --> 00:02:01.340
my body is destroyed and I have,
I worry constantly about else.

29
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.550
No more joy no more.
Yeah.
That's so true.
I mean,
I,

30
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.700
I don't think I really have fun deal.
Do we have fun?

31
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.640
Um,
no,
we don't have fun.
This might be like the most fun thing we do.

32
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.180
Yeah.
That's probably why we've kept it up for so long.
I'm sure it's why.
Yeah,

33
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.470
yeah.
We enjoy doing this.
Right,
but,
but in terms of scheduling,

34
00:02:23.471 --> 00:02:26.710
fun and vacation is imperative.
You have to schedule The kid.

35
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.580
It doesn't matter where you're at in life.
I'm saying like if you go like,
oh,

36
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.270
vacations expensive.
If your vacation is just staying home,

37
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.030
not doing anything and driving to get ice cream at night and that's your base,

38
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.250
then that you need to do it.
You have to take a break.
Yeah,
take a break.

39
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.480
I think it's better to leave though.

40
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.560
It's always better to leave the home base because I've done the home vacay thing

41
00:02:47.561 --> 00:02:51.200
too,
and then you just get wrapped up in your traditional drama.
It's true.

42
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.160
All right,
let's do a traditional,
oh yeah.
Wow.

43
00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.360
Let's get into it.
Dual credit.
Dual credit card that I was taking a nap.

44
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.210
He had come home far did at me after.
I assume,

45
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.420
I just need to make sure I'm hearing this correctly.
Did you fart

46
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.550
<v 2>her face?</v>

47
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.470
<v 1>Don't bring it to live</v>

48
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.460
to your mom's house

49
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.190
<v 2>and at Twitter.
That's all.
What?
What did you like?
Because I had,</v>

50
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.940
I wrote a tweet it to that kid that got bullied.
Yeah.
And um,
I got the,

51
00:03:35.941 --> 00:03:40.880
it got tweeted or retweeted a good bunch.
No,
I wrote,
um,
right,

52
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.330
right.
His name is Keaton if you haven't seen it,
there's this kid and he,

53
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.170
he makes this tells his mom that like kids are bullying me in school and it's

54
00:03:48.171 --> 00:03:50.990
really,
he gets real emotional and he talks about how,

55
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.960
how it's the kids are so mean and he's like,
I don't understand.

56
00:03:53.961 --> 00:03:56.060
What they do is when people are just different.
And she's like,

57
00:03:56.061 --> 00:03:57.020
what do they say to you?
And he,

58
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.520
he tells her like they call me ugly and they're just really mean.
It's,

59
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.820
it's like a heartbreaking video.

60
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.350
And since she posted it went viral and like everyone is inviting this kid to

61
00:04:06.351 --> 00:04:09.890
shit like Tennessee titans of bringing them to a football game.

62
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.660
<v 0>Right.
I know celebrities are on,</v>

63
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.100
but isn't that kind of bullying of the mother to post a very vulnerable,

64
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.180
it's a yellow sun isn't a while,
isn't that not protecting him?
Yeah,

65
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.490
I mean calling him.
Well anyways,
he is,
I see what you exactly what you're saying.

66
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.710
Do that.
I'd be like,
no,
don't fucking post that video.
You're an asshole for good.

67
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.640
It worked out in this way.
So he's got,
Cavaliers invited him to a game,
um,

68
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:35.380
three or four

69
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.000
<v 2>movie stars have invited him to movie premieres,
Chris Evans,
uh,
what's his name?</v>

70
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.890
Uh,
forget the fucking guys name.

71
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.820
Then Dana white invited them to a UFC headquarters.
So he's like,

72
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.530
everyone's reaching out this kid.
So I just stop for a second today and I wrote,

73
00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:53.950
Hey Keaton,
don't get uh,
uh,
too,

74
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.150
too full of yourself with all this attention.
I will fuck you up.

75
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.420
And there's not a thing your mom or Lebron or Chris Evans can do about it.

76
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.010
And that's it.
It's funny.
Yeah.
And it get,

77
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.860
right now it's got about 3000 retweets and 8,000 likes.
But yeah,
both of the,

78
00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:09.694
uh,

79
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.030
the comments underneath that are hilarious because people are either being like,

80
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.910
hell yes.
And getting that,
that's a joke.
Or,

81
00:05:18.911 --> 00:05:23.810
and putting like funny memes and gifs under it or they're being like really

82
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.690
taking it very seriously.
Like,
you know,
you're what's wrong.
Uh,
not,
you know,

83
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.620
that's not funny.
Who made you do this?
Like just shit like that.

84
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:35.020
So it was just funny.
And then I saw some guy,

85
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.320
cause people are a clowning that they also started like a go fund.
Me,

86
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.160
the Mother did.

87
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.060
<v 0>Oh what happened?
Cause I follow this Instagram account,
Hollywood um,</v>

88
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.570
unlocked or something.
Yeah.

89
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.970
And that UFC guy was on there saying that he invited that boy,

90
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.240
but the mother was like,
don't invite him.
I'm not letting him go,

91
00:05:51.241 --> 00:05:55.380
but you can promote my go fund me page.
And then he goes for what?
And she's like,

92
00:05:55.381 --> 00:06:00.381
well Christmas is coming and I'm a single and I want money for my kids a fame.

93
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.920
So she's really,
really ruining this for her son by the way.
She's not cool.

94
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.420
<v 2>People started,
go fund me for being bullied.</v>

95
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:13.400
But there they're making a mockery of it.
Like uh,
this,
this guy here

96
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.210
<v 0>looking out of like window blinds.</v>

97
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.800
Like what's it say Tom Reese,
Nigga stay bullying me and shit and it,

98
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.000
and it's $100,000 goal.
How much does he had so far?

99
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.060
But it really made me laugh.
So,
yeah.
Yeah,
man,

100
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.100
I love people's,
um,
Internet,
Internet,
um,
things,

101
00:06:44.101 --> 00:06:44.671
you know what I mean?

102
00:06:44.671 --> 00:06:48.390
Like it's really healing the world when you take a stand against shit,
like,
oh,

103
00:06:48.391 --> 00:06:52.800
come on dude.
I think it's funny.
I'm opposed to the terrorist attacks.
Well,

104
00:06:52.801 --> 00:06:55.800
of course everyone is.
I think it's funny that people take this seriously.

105
00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.000
That mean that take my tweets.
Right,
right,
right,
right.

106
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.280
Are you talking about like,
yeah.
Well,
yeah,
that's,
you know,

107
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.440
that's what's gonna that's what divides us.
Yeah.
That's what,
that's,
that's the,

108
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.240
you know,
I tell you the Internet is pretty miraculous in that it exposes the,

109
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.240
the humanity of everyone and the joy.
Yeah.

110
00:07:15.241 --> 00:07:20.100
And then the absolute dump fuckery of,
uh,
I'd say 80%.

111
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.640
I'd say we're at 80% retarded for,
for Boral.
What do you think?

112
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:24.660
I think when people,

113
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.540
<v 2>I think the greatest,
I've said this before,</v>

114
00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:31.541
the greatest indicator of stupidity is when you don't process when something is

115
00:07:35.091 --> 00:07:36.530
clearly a joke.
Yeah.

116
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.420
So there are so many people that don't process,

117
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.520
don't understand,
don't register sarcasm or satire.
Right.
Irony.
None of it.

118
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.900
None of it goes through their head.

119
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.660
That's the greatest indicator of a stupid person

120
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:51.581
<v 0>that,</v>

121
00:07:51.581 --> 00:07:56.581
and I would say the folks who belong that God is sending hurricanes or fires

122
00:07:57.341 --> 00:08:00.910
because of what gays are doing.
Like my mom stuff like,

123
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.540
well does she really think that it's to punish the gays and stuff like no,

124
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.330
no fuckers.
Fuckers.

125
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.640
It's that we need to be better people to each other.
Oh right.
Yeah.
That,

126
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.180
yeah.
We're not being good to each other were yeah.
And I'm like,
yeah,
yeah.

127
00:08:19.181 --> 00:08:21.400
And then she's like,
and you know these hurricanes and I'm like,
ah,

128
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.120
God teaching us a lesson.
Huh?
Yup.

129
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.540
Well how come he doesn't reward us when stuff's going well?

130
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.850
Well he does life look all this amazing stuff.
Water's everywhere.

131
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:33.470
Yeah.

132
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:37.370
<v 2>There's stuff like that.
I talked about it on stage about her POV of that.</v>

133
00:08:37.371 --> 00:08:42.260
I didn't do it this weekend,
but I had been doing it and about how at a certain,

134
00:08:42.261 --> 00:08:47.261
like you have this conversation with her and I at 22 or three,

135
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.960
I am going to make sure every point that I have about that is expressed.

136
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.040
Oh boy.
And I know going to build into

137
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.873
<v 0>a fight.</v>

138
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:02.010
You tell me now that you think God sends the fires and I think about the energy

139
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:06.130
it would take to have that argument and then I just go like I know.
Yeah,

140
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.410
I know we got to do better to each other.

141
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.490
Isn't that the essence of middle age or approaching middle age?
I guess so.

142
00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.770
You just,
you do this too tired.

143
00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:18.990
The exhaustion mentally and spiritually that would take,
that's where the,

144
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.110
they're not giving a fuck is awesome at this age of your life.

145
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.780
There's so many things I don't fucking care about any.

146
00:09:24.781 --> 00:09:28.740
I know things that used to really wind me up,
you know?
I don't,

147
00:09:28.741 --> 00:09:31.950
I just don't have the energy either.
I could.
By the way,

148
00:09:31.951 --> 00:09:36.951
it's so funny that this was a clip I could charge you with assault of what you

149
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.950
just did.
It's literally,
you had no idea this was what was planned.

150
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.920
It's literally part of the show today.

151
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.680
His former roommate or or teas in the amount of $596 he says after pulling a

152
00:09:54.031 --> 00:09:57.240
prank on the defendant,
she viciously attacked him.

153
00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.200
That's so his tooth.

154
00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.540
<v 3>You didn't lose your too,
but you chipped it.
Tipped it.
Yeah.
Oh,</v>

155
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.710
just take a look at that.
On the plasma.
And she did look at that.
Ooh,

156
00:10:05.711 --> 00:10:07.230
from the farm.
Well,

157
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.200
the risk taliation roommate and my sister knew him well.

158
00:10:11.201 --> 00:10:14.440
How did the two end up getting shipped?
Basically,

159
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.030
it's going to sound a little gross,

160
00:10:16.031 --> 00:10:20.140
but Vince is lactose intolerant and I don't know why.

161
00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:25.100
Given his age,
he's not in third grade anymore,
but I liked ice cream.
He,
he's,

162
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.000
he probably doesn't like ice cream.

163
00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:33.760
<v 0>Yes,
your honor.
So I can cut.
We're getting into that.</v>

164
00:10:33.761 --> 00:10:36.990
He purposely ate some ice cream.
Right.
And he's lactose intolerant.

165
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.800
He knows what's going to happen.

166
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.070
<v 3>The homeless man knows what ice cream does to him because he's lactose</v>

167
00:10:41.071 --> 00:10:45.780
intolerant and he tends to,
I know what light ice cream you'd,
however,

168
00:10:45.781 --> 00:10:48.930
I don't like having ice cream thrown at my face and that's actually what she is.

169
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:54.310
What happened at all frozen hard brick of ice cream out of nowhere.
Just through.

170
00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:00.000
<v 0>So you can already tell he's a liar actually.
I think he's full of Shit.
Yeah,</v>

171
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:06.040
<v 3>I was taking a nap.
He had come home.
I sit.</v>

172
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.960
I just need to make sure I'm hearing this correctly.

173
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.480
Did you fart in her face

174
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:17.220
<v 0>moments before this podcast started?
You had sat here,</v>

175
00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.980
you recorded some ads and then I said,
hey,

176
00:11:19.981 --> 00:11:22.050
I need to sit here to get back into this show.

177
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.940
You stood up and right here you farted.
I disgusting.

178
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.150
And I farted on your shoulder though.
Not In your face.

179
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:31.770
Let the judge explained some things.

180
00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:35.000
<v 3>Well,
I guess in a way,
yeah,</v>

181
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.190
when I was walking the smell.

182
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.560
<v 0>Did you smell my,
of course it's horrible.
What it smell like.</v>

183
00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:53.830
Anything in your presence regarding this party?
Oh boy has there.

184
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:59.760
So this is the sister now weighing in the end that that he's a habitual farter

185
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.070
that seems to be a regular part of his act.

186
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:08.490
He did make a lot of fart jokes during his act and he does tend to Fart a lot on

187
00:12:08.981 --> 00:12:12.280
on purpose and all.
There's the occasional slip up,

188
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:17.290
but he does think it's funny to Fart on people.
It is funny.

189
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.410
It is funny.
That's funny about that.
I'm not arguing that.
I mean,

190
00:12:20.411 --> 00:12:23.780
if we're in the court of what's funny,
I'd say this guy wins.
Yeah.

191
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.050
Because any evidence and the testimony before this court,

192
00:12:26.051 --> 00:12:29.230
the gavel is going to come down in favor of the defendant because out of

193
00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:32.500
everyone that was talking not real crazy about you,
you're a little mouthy,

194
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.170
but your sister,
she was sobbing.

195
00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:40.760
<v 2>Then one left thing here,
really ranking those performances.
Judge,</v>

196
00:12:40.761 --> 00:12:44.390
the judge says,
I think maybe you should pay attention to

197
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.160
<v 0>when did you realize it or not,
but I talked about the chain of events.</v>

198
00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.750
When you farted on her,
I was in the salt.
A salt.

199
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.470
You don't have to put your hands on someone to assault them.

200
00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:01.610
A fart is an assault far doesn't assault well,
it's interesting.

201
00:13:01.611 --> 00:13:05.600
We learn something new every day on this show every,
every week rather.

202
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:10.460
So did I assault you?
That's what you're claiming of course.
And assault.
Yeah,

203
00:13:10.461 --> 00:13:15.080
you did.
Yeah.
You did bart and her face.
Yes she did.

204
00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.880
What are the damages?
What are the damages?
I don't know.
$1 million,

205
00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:23.970
$1 million dusting.
I'm for me for my emotional distress and that shit.

206
00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.240
What did I,
what did I stop you from doing in your life?

207
00:13:26.241 --> 00:13:29.900
From getting my mind together.
Confusing about the smell.

208
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.370
<v 2>I think confusing about what did it smell like?
Let's talk about my farm.</v>

209
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:38.110
It smelled really disgusting.
It really did well.
Like what?
Like Sour Shit.

210
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:42.940
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why do you smell so bad?
Because I went to the salad bar and I,

211
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.930
I get my a thousand ranch dressing.
I make it a Gelson's.

212
00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.370
I thought of another one by the way,

213
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.800
where we were talking earlier about things that we think we are like,

214
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.010
you know when you,
when you like,

215
00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.190
like it came up because it's had two is you're like,
I want to get a tattoo.

216
00:13:57.191 --> 00:13:57.791
Like that lady.

217
00:13:57.791 --> 00:14:00.970
Like you'll see somebody with like half sleeve or some color and you're like,

218
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.920
well then you go,
but that's not me.

219
00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:08.490
You know what I always wanted want to be sounds like the leather bound,

220
00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.250
a daily planner person.

221
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:16.180
Person once in my life I bought them because I love,
I love,

222
00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:19.540
I love luggage and I love,
you know,

223
00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:21.550
let like leather bound anything,

224
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:26.560
whether it's a backpack or a briefcase.
Like I just,
I have like,

225
00:14:26.561 --> 00:14:28.300
I kind of fetishize,

226
00:14:28.301 --> 00:14:33.220
romanticize any artists and work handmade,
handcrafted,
you know what I mean?

227
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.910
Anything like that.
I go like,
Oh,
I want that thing.
Then I get it and I,

228
00:14:36.911 --> 00:14:37.840
and I don't use it.

229
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:43.070
I give you stuff that's leather bound a lot like bidding to it.
And then this is,

230
00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:46.420
this is a little wallet I use of course,

231
00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:50.080
but I'll hand you like a new thing and I'll go,
oh thanks.
Put it down.

232
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.160
It's gone forever.
And

233
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:56.420
<v 0>anyway,
this,
yes,
this topic came up in regards to the Tattoo.</v>

234
00:14:56.421 --> 00:15:00.980
I mentioned I wanted my midlife crisis tattoo.
Yes.
And I thought about it.

235
00:15:00.981 --> 00:15:02.990
I got many offerings.
No,

236
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.860
on my inner arm for Vitamin D,

237
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:13.340
it's never 2% it's all full milk,
whole milk,
whole verbal.

238
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:18.320
And I came to the conclusion that I may want it,

239
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:22.280
but I'm not the person who does it.
Like meaning I think I'm that girl.

240
00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:27.380
But the truth of it is I shop at the gap and I'm super boring and like I don't

241
00:15:27.381 --> 00:15:31.400
have the cahones boring.
I would say that you don't identify,

242
00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.020
I'm too traditional.

243
00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:37.430
Like part of me worries about being 80 years old and being in an airport because

244
00:15:37.431 --> 00:15:41.720
I saw this woman at the airport who was like 70 old tattoo.

245
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:42.643
She didn't have a hassle,

246
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:47.630
but she had something on her leg that was so hideously inappropriate for her age

247
00:15:47.631 --> 00:15:49.850
and I was like,
I can't do it.
It's just not me.

248
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.030
And there's a whole slew of things I wish I could be.

249
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.650
I wish I could be the girl when they take photos that they don't smile,

250
00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:02.510
they just look like they're mouth is.
Yeah.
Cool.
But I always am like,

251
00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:05.240
picture it like I'm so,
I'm like a Labrador.

252
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:09.530
I wanted to be the get up and grind exercise guy.
Like I exercise.

253
00:16:09.531 --> 00:16:12.560
I work out a lot.
No,
I'm saying like I work out a lot,

254
00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:18.130
but I've always read about and hear about the guy that gets up at like five dot.

255
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.400
Like Mark Walberg.
I follow them on Instagram.
He's up at four.

256
00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:27.530
What are you doing with your life early?
Why?
I've tried it.

257
00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:30.920
I hate it.
It's terrible.
I have to work out in the,

258
00:16:30.921 --> 00:16:35.540
I can work out in the morning after a certain hour,
like at least eight.

259
00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:40.250
I'd rather work at 11 cause I need to feel alive just to do it.

260
00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:45.190
Well I'd be those people that wake up at like 4:00 AM fuck that their days start

261
00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:46.220
earlier but they don't,
they work,

262
00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:50.960
they start work at like seven fantasize about like being that that motivated

263
00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:56.900
the guy that fucking grinds it.
Like from the sun before the sun comes up.

264
00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.980
Oh God,
that sounds terrible.
I um,
the girl,

265
00:17:00.981 --> 00:17:05.981
I also want to be as the one that wears high heels and has like beach wavy hair.

266
00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.310
Like she cares.

267
00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:12.310
She wakes up early and she curls it and then also is really into facial

268
00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:17.030
treatments.
Her,
where is she?
She's here.
She's not in this house.

269
00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:18.340
Oh right.

270
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
And the girl who's like really up on the facials and injections and like really

271
00:17:25.491 --> 00:17:28.130
into like that level of self care.
You could be that girl.
Yeah.

272
00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.860
But know how much energy that girl expense and when this shit,

273
00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.780
I ain't got that kind of time.
No,
I'm an,

274
00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.500
I also fantasize about being a motorcycle guy,

275
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:41.770
not like a fucking,
like in a bike game.
The motorcycle.

276
00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:45.960
Like I'll see a beautiful bike and I'll go like,
ah,
and I've,

277
00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:49.830
I've never written one and I don't really honestly don't want ride one.

278
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.400
<v 2>When I like when I see them here on the four oh five and like weaving between</v>

279
00:17:53.401 --> 00:17:55.310
cars.
Oh that gives me anxiety.
Yeah.

280
00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:59.910
What I do fantasize about is the open road in like Wyoming,

281
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:05.190
you know,
or you just see it like you just picture open road.
Maybe it's uh,

282
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:09.720
maybe it's on a ranch or something and there's like some dirt trails and I

283
00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:12.590
fantasize like that be cool.
I'd like to do that.
But then I go,

284
00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:15.960
I'm not gonna do that,
you know,
but I still lose myself in the thoughts.

285
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.990
<v 0>Yeah.
Cause you'll see like a picture of someone and you're like,</v>

286
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.390
I could be that person.
I have

287
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.780
<v 2>stop myself from buying,
um,
luggage all the time,</v>

288
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:29.600
just because like,
especially when it gets more niche,
you know,

289
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.280
I was like,
I bought a suitcase for our trip and they're like,

290
00:18:32.281 --> 00:18:34.770
we have these backpacks,
we have these shoulder packs,
we have this.

291
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:39.690
So every time it's any type of compartment that you can get.
I'm like,
ah,
yeah,

292
00:18:39.691 --> 00:18:44.600
yeah,
yeah.
And I could put pens in that.
Yeah.
Like,
like I,
I just want,
I dunno,

293
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.680
I fantasize that light.
Okay.

294
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.120
<v 0>Being that organized,
like that organized or just,</v>

295
00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:53.030
I like compartmentalizing things in a,
in a cool case.
Oh,
you know,

296
00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:57.120
I like a cool box.
Yeah.
It's almost like a gadget noise.
You know?

297
00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.180
It's not a gadget,
but it's like a cousin.
Right,
right.

298
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.350
That like the presentation of the thing,
it's like,
why a cool cigar box is cool.

299
00:19:04.351 --> 00:19:07.930
It's like it's not the cigar,
the container,
the container it comes in.
Yeah.

300
00:19:07.931 --> 00:19:08.710
That's interesting.

301
00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.750
<v 2>Yeah.
But then at the same time,</v>

302
00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.200
I'm aware of myself enough to not overdo it.

303
00:19:14.201 --> 00:19:17.290
So I'll see that thing and I'll go like,
yeah,
and then I go,

304
00:19:17.291 --> 00:19:18.280
you're not going to fucking use.

305
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.171
<v 0>Well,
the thing too,</v>

306
00:19:19.171 --> 00:19:23.700
I've realized about my personality is that I can only own like five things at a

307
00:19:23.701 --> 00:19:27.600
time because I'll buy,
I'll buy other stuff and then I'll forget it.
I'll be like,

308
00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:31.560
oh,
I have that.
So are like,
I just don't,
I'll forget about it.

309
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.770
I honestly can only own five things.
I,
I'm with you on that.

310
00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:39.490
<v 2>I feel like I'll buy something nice like a nice shirt and then I'll see it in</v>

311
00:19:39.491 --> 00:19:41.650
the closet and I'll go like,
oh,
uh,

312
00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.620
right now I'm going to run out and um,

313
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:49.180
go to the grocery store and then,
you know,
run it.
I Dunno.
Run another errand.

314
00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.290
And I go,
she put on that shirt,
but I go,
but that's too nice of a shirt for that,

315
00:19:53.291 --> 00:19:54.124
Aaron.

316
00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:55.750
<v 0>I do that all the time.
Yeah.</v>

317
00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:00.470
I'm saving the clothing for a special occasion and then we go like do that all

318
00:20:00.471 --> 00:20:04.210
the time.
We're going to dinner tonight when I go into a nice guy,

319
00:20:04.211 --> 00:20:07.020
I do that all one time.
I get a joint,

320
00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:11.930
just save it for then we have vacation.
I go and I go.
But like,
yeah,

321
00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:16.190
oh fuck it up on the vacation.
Yeah.
So I better leave it here.

322
00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.500
That's a problem.
Why did the same thing?

323
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:22.490
I have a coat that you bought me fancy coat and I haven't found,

324
00:20:22.491 --> 00:20:26.510
I found one occasion to wear it on so far.
Better fucking find it.
I don't know.

325
00:20:26.511 --> 00:20:29.540
It's such a bummer and it's the most beautiful coat and it is a beautiful coat.

326
00:20:29.541 --> 00:20:32.060
It's like really regretted getting it for you.
Thank you.

327
00:20:32.061 --> 00:20:36.350
And I inherited these ridiculous fur coats from my mother when she died.

328
00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:41.600
And those just stay in my closet like there is absolutely nowhere to wear a fur

329
00:20:41.601 --> 00:20:45.050
coat and Los Angeles.
Sorry.
Are you crazy?

330
00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:49.720
Only a crazy person buys real coats like makes and shit.

331
00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.070
This isn't a bizarre isn't,

332
00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:55.960
this is not an official dental outdate but as my as well,
it should be.

333
00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:01.010
<v 4>Embrace your fucking teeth brushed him.
Guide the empty.</v>

334
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:05.110
I don't understand how you can walk around and not brush up like that.

335
00:21:05.111 --> 00:21:08.270
Did your brand's bag ain't got teeth the dirty.
No ma'am.

336
00:21:08.271 --> 00:21:09.420
They didn't have we role.

337
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.880
<v 0>You know what I mean?
That is a,
yeah.
Yeah.</v>

338
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:18.720
Jasmine masters.
She was on ru Paul's drag race.
Just making sure.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

339
00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.380
I like to clarify confusion in my brain.
That's a good idea.

340
00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:26.130
But I liked the message.
I'm trying to on board 100% with her.

341
00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.000
<v 4>I need you to fix that.</v>

342
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:33.060
Use a little car rocks you have to those Listerine,

343
00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:35.670
the brown kinds.
I can get all straight through.

344
00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:40.160
<v 0>She's saying she's sick.
She's sick of foul mouth man.
You know,</v>

345
00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:44.010
who is she hanging out with?
I think she to hanging out with anyone's CD.

346
00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:47.110
You to see that you see people with funky at miles all the time.

347
00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.430
And the problem is what if you're close to one of those and how do you tell
them?

348
00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.190
How do you tell somebody my world?
You just speak right up,
you know,

349
00:21:55.410 --> 00:22:00.300
and comedian worlds,
you can,
you can be like,
Bro,
Shit's all fucked up.

350
00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:06.480
Shit's all whack.
I've told people who have you told parents?
Oh,

351
00:22:06.481 --> 00:22:07.500
well that's different.

352
00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.800
You tell your mom and dad you were embarrassed about their mouth's daily.

353
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:15.660
I'm always like,
are you guys going to address that?
What?
They just laugh.

354
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.730
I know.
I don't know if they actually do anything,

355
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.670
but they do because they've told me.
My Dad called me.
He was like,
oh,

356
00:22:20.671 --> 00:22:23.700
I just left the dentist.
He told me,
he called me that like a month ago.
Oh he did?

357
00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.060
Yeah.
And how'd it go?
I Dunno.
I'm like,
did they rip all your teeth out?

358
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.870
I was like,
no,
get him clean bill of health.
I'm like,
you're going to a liar.

359
00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:36.420
<v 4>No,
but it was a little anything but get in between them.
Chief,</v>

360
00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:42.020
the front end,
the bag,
the size in them teeth.

361
00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:46.010
<v 0>She's got an safe.
Yeah,
I was just noticing and flossing does she,</v>

362
00:22:46.011 --> 00:22:47.380
she doesn't even mention philosophy.

363
00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:51.070
That's the key to good dental hygiene is probably got hit on by someone with

364
00:22:51.071 --> 00:22:53.230
fuck you.
Fuck you teeth.
That's a probably what?
You know what I mean?

365
00:22:53.231 --> 00:22:57.430
It's like a event about inventing about that happening

366
00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.310
<v 4>and brushy Chris Mallon at Pima with in your teeth.
That's like cute.</v>

367
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.160
Please get it together.
Just thank you.

368
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:08.910
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
I think that's what happened.
Somebody was like,
Hey,
what's</v>

369
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:15.000
Cha?
Shit's nasty,
nasty,
nasty.

370
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:20.050
That's terrible.
I'm always so self conscious about that.
Yeah.

371
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:23.880
Bad,
bad coffee breath and stuff.
Yeah.

372
00:23:23.881 --> 00:23:25.860
It's the first thing I do in the morning is,
I mean,

373
00:23:25.861 --> 00:23:29.810
I don't know how anybody skips that step in the morning.
I told,

374
00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.810
I talked about this years ago on your mom's house,
but uh,

375
00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:38.060
I knew somebody whose mother would only brush her teeth once a day and she would

376
00:23:39.301 --> 00:23:40.980
wake up,
drink the coffee,

377
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:46.250
and then go all day without brushing her teeth.
It was real crazy.

378
00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:49.280
So then she would brush like by five o'clock and they're like,

379
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:53.360
you need to brush way,
way earlier.
How does it not bother you?

380
00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.880
That's the thing.
She's like,
I don't like,
she goes,

381
00:23:55.881 --> 00:23:59.420
I don't like the flavor of the toothpaste.
I don't like the taste of toothpaste.

382
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.220
And they said,
well,
you know,

383
00:24:01.221 --> 00:24:05.360
you can get like cinnamon can get chocolate flavored,
whatever.

384
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:08.850
And so they did,
they got her the flavor she liked and then,

385
00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:12.260
then she started doing it.
But you know,
that's somebody's mom,
bro.

386
00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:14.240
It's really crazy.
That's a lifetime.

387
00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:19.220
<v 2>Uh,
Josh Weinstein was here last week.

It's available on like all the pay per view cable things.

It's on Amazon.
Um,
on indb some of our listeners,

395
00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:50.230
I got into the trivia portion of the film.
Oh dear.

396
00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.550

Who prefers to what,
where high,

They have a son named Jean.

400
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.260
Tom Considers himself a mommy just like we're seeing it as they say there.

401
00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.470
There's two mommies and one gene.
Shortly,

402
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.670
shortly after this film was shot Thompson Grub again [inaudible] as a DJ named

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:38.050
Speaking of kill Tom's favorite movies and re portrait of a serial killer,

409
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:42.100

410
00:25:42.101 --> 00:25:45.490
riveting and hilarious.
Amr,
I saw the Dahmer thing.

411
00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:50.860
Somebody tweeted you the Ted Bundy thing.
I saw that on Twitter.
Somebody said,

412
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:53.020
is this a young teenage Tom?

413
00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.770
And it was Ted Bundy being led down some courthouse stairs.

414
00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.840
There's like a kid in the background smiling,

415
00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:05.320
I think it was Vegas seven Oh two around a long time.
Vegas.

416
00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:08.470
This says also the Tom's Griffin Asia to be amazed.

417
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:13.420
He was inspired to go on his trip by his spiritual advisor,
Kim,

418
00:26:13.421 --> 00:26:17.950
and so that's really awesome.
That's really,

419
00:26:17.951 --> 00:26:20.350
really nice to you to with that.

420
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:25.810
<v 0>You think that the Wikipedia is and the imdbs of the world will figure out that</v>

421
00:26:26.071 --> 00:26:31.071
this communal posting thing is not really bringing forth truth in the world on

422
00:26:31.441 --> 00:26:34.740
the Internet.
I don't know.

423
00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:38.730
Just my Wikipedia page says,
I was born in Toronto and that is inaccurate.

424
00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:43.260
Said fucking Dayton forever doing this.
Whose Windsor?

425
00:26:43.261 --> 00:26:47.700
Ontario guys.
Glamorous.
Windsor.
Windsor Cross for five.

426
00:26:47.701 --> 00:26:52.080
One three men.
They Twan.
Yeah.
Come on now.
I'm not that classy to be from the T.

427
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.800
Dot.
Yeah.
No,
I dunno.
People can just add what they want.

428
00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:59.760
Then it becomes a fact.
I know.
And then I do all this press stuff,

429
00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:02.140
but they're like,
you're born in Toronto and let it grow.

430
00:27:02.141 --> 00:27:05.490
I get to ask the dating thing.
You're from Dayton.
I'm like,
dude,

431
00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.080
I want to date you the first time I was probably 28 right there.

432
00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:13.890
Like that's where you're from.
Like Kim deal.
Kim deal from Dayton,
Ohio.
Um,

433
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:19.580
what does this question here?
Somebody said,
is Joey Diaz insane?
Yeah.

434
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:22.420
I was listening on your recent podcasts was blown away when Joe,

435
00:27:22.421 --> 00:27:26.430
he admitted to dropping a hot me brown in the shower and then physically picking

436
00:27:26.431 --> 00:27:28.350
up with his bare hands and toss it in the toilet.

437
00:27:28.351 --> 00:27:32.520
What's even more perplexing is that minutes after admitting shitting in the

438
00:27:32.521 --> 00:27:37.230
shower three times in his life,
he said he was quoted to have said,
this is true.

439
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:42.300
You have to be an animal to shit on an airplane.
It made my dad Boehner flacid.

440
00:27:42.301 --> 00:27:45.660
When I heard this,
I was confused and disturbed.
I had to change my pronoun.

441
00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.540
Why does he think Browning and a plane bathroom is silver?

442
00:27:48.541 --> 00:27:52.890
Pulsive but full on shitting in the shower and picking up your bare hands is
not.

443
00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:55.410
I love the podcast.
I always look forward to Joey stories.

444
00:27:55.411 --> 00:27:59.640
Please piss on me and beat me.
Try it out.
There's some Kansas.
Oh my God.

445
00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:04.420
That's a new,
that's a new greeting.
Yeah.
Wow.
That was hilarious.
Piss on me.

446
00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:06.090
Yeah,
try it out.

447
00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:13.590
Try it out is the best part of that whole thing.
Try it out.
Come over here.

448
00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:19.260
He's on black guys won't fucking fuck.
Oh good.
Oh my God.
That is fuck me.

449
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:24.330
Come over.
He wouldn't get out of prison.
Friends out and let's talk a pissed.

450
00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:27.020
Let me try it out only as fuck,
man.

451
00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:32.090
I'm looking for hardcore guys want to do it and I want to show I'm a hot salt,

452
00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:34.410
my trash come down plus fuck.

453
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.950
He's also like trying to say so much and he's like tripping over his own words

454
00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:44.310
from my fuck me.
I mean it's really,

455
00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:45.870
really fine enough for it.

456
00:28:45.871 --> 00:28:48.900
He's so excited to answer the email question about Joey.

457
00:28:48.901 --> 00:28:52.650
It's because it's a lunatic person.
You're asking to think rationally.

458
00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:57.930
Only somebody that crazy.
We'll go like,
yeah,
I pick up shifts in my shower,

459
00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:01.200
throw them into the toilet,
but shitting on the plane,

460
00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:06.240
of course he's not logical human being.
He's got his own code.
Yeah,

461
00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:10.200
it makes sense to him,
which is what's amazing about him.
To be fair,

462
00:29:10.201 --> 00:29:14.790
I think every human has their own sense of what's decent and what's not and

463
00:29:14.791 --> 00:29:19.710
that's just Joey's logic.
Then again,
you know,

464
00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:23.730
I think,
I think shitting on a plane is horrendous.
Then again,

465
00:29:23.731 --> 00:29:26.730
picking up a low for shit and throwing it from the shower into the toilet's

466
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.630
pretty gnarly too.
I don't know.
Oh yeah,
that's true.
God,

467
00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:36.070
I had such a messy brown the other day and I was so thankful for our birthdays.

468
00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:38.610
So thankful there really are amazing.

469
00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:44.080
I how did we even white before the downside of thinking about Hawaii.
I'm like,

470
00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.470
well,
we'll be able to wash my ass ever time.

471
00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.290
I really love it.
You know,
it's interesting.
Um,

472
00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.670
I was talking to you the other day about when I was pregnant with Ellis,

473
00:29:54.671 --> 00:29:56.650
how I could really smell things.

474
00:29:56.651 --> 00:30:01.480
Like you have that pregnant lady smell and I remember when you would fart.

475
00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:06.280
I could smell the layers to it.
Like some of it was nutty,

476
00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.850
earthy,
so cool.
I could smell the oak tones,

477
00:30:09.851 --> 00:30:14.740
I could smell the tonal qualities.
The fruit will cool.
Cool.

478
00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:19.570
And then you go,
oh,
you're like a fart.
Somalia.
Yeah.
And I thought,
what a neat,

479
00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:23.770
what any title and somebody out there is a fart.
Some all,
Yay.
Yeah,
you are.

480
00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.880
What do you mean somebody out there you are,
you're a farm somewhere.

481
00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:30.100
You only if I'm pregnant because that's,
that's like a pregnant lady superpower.

482
00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:34.340
Is there smell?
Yeah.
But no,
you,
you are a far Somalia.
Yeah.

483
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.740
Yeah.
A R T I will say that when I go take,

484
00:30:38.741 --> 00:30:41.030
when I go in the bathroom after you've taken a dump,
yeah.

485
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:45.460
You're after dump smells are sweet.
Oh I dunno what it is.

486
00:30:45.461 --> 00:30:49.630
But your browns have either a very sour quality when they're sick,

487
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:51.580
you know when you've eaten shellfish or something.

488
00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:54.070
But they're generally very sweet diabetes

489
00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:58.720
far.
And Yeah.

490
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.280
Now he's supposed to be joined here any moment by the gray.

491
00:31:02.281 --> 00:31:06.630
Pauly shore is a week.
I had to say it.

492
00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:11.440
I grew up watching him.
Um,
I don't know where you're watching MTV back.
Fuck yeah,

493
00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:15.490
that was like naughty.
He was so famous that and the movies,

494
00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.580
I loved his movies as Christ.
You know,
my dad's favorite movie,

495
00:31:18.581 --> 00:31:22.110
his son in law son in law was great,
which is no man Hilaire Encino man.

496
00:31:22.111 --> 00:31:26.110
It was great.
Which is funny cause my dad obviously has that cultural divide of,

497
00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:28.390
you know,
being like a hardcore Hungarian.
Yeah.

498
00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:32.770
And it was so funny to always walk in on him just hysterically laughing at Pauly

499
00:31:32.771 --> 00:31:37.150
shore and son in law.
He's like these guys so stupid.
He just loved it.
Yeah.

500
00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:42.460
Yeah.
So for foreigners,
really our Intel,
you know,
let's take a quick break.
Okay.

501
00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:45.370
Be here any moment.
Okay.
Mommy,
let's take a break from there.

502
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:50.020
<v 2>Okay.
All right.
So that was a,
that was exactly the right time to take a break.</v>

503
00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:54.640
I mean I turn this shit out.
Perfect.
And I have to say he was on time.
So,
um,

504
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:58.280
we're here with the great Pauly shore.
Thanks for coming over.

505
00:31:58.281 --> 00:32:02.360
And this is exciting.
I haven't seen you since Tommy gave you a paid regular.

506
00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:07.750
I know we keep missing each other various senior around once in a while,

507
00:32:07.751 --> 00:32:11.440
but that's hilarious.
It's pretty surreal man.
Free,
surreal that you're here.
No,

508
00:32:11.441 --> 00:32:14.260
I mean for both of us because we both,

509
00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:18.280
like we both grew up in the MTV era cause you and I were talking once in the

510
00:32:18.281 --> 00:32:21.550
green room at the store about,
you know,
a lot of the stuff you've done.

511
00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.830
But even with the movies and everything,

512
00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:29.190
if you go back to people that grew up with like MTV as like the cool thing to

513
00:32:29.201 --> 00:32:33.880
the vjs thing is like for people that are,

514
00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:39.130
I dunno,
under 30 listening or watching right now,
they don't,
they have no,

515
00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:40.640
what MTV

516
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:44.790
<v 0>was.
MTV was the only cool outlet there.
Well,</v>

517
00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.960
it was like there's,
there's like,
there's the network shows,

518
00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.250
there's like a couple cable things.
There's only like fucking 30 cool.

519
00:32:52.251 --> 00:32:56.330
Like whatever that was cool was and TV and I think Paula,
you tapped into it.

520
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:58.560
Like with the weasel it was like,
okay,

521
00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.530
<v 5>that's not how you say it by the way.</v>

522
00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:06.570
It's hilarious.
No,
it was like,
you know,
it's,

523
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:10.530
it's like a viral video.
It's like,
you know,
I did a Steven Miller video,

524
00:33:10.531 --> 00:33:12.060
I don't know,
a couple months ago and it just,

525
00:33:12.061 --> 00:33:15.300
it took off and then you do another video and it doesn't take off.

526
00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:19.110
And it's like MTV,
everything lined up for me and every,

527
00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:22.590
everything lined up for what was happening at the time.
I mean,

528
00:33:22.591 --> 00:33:27.330
MTV was very east coast.
If you think back,
it was like,
you know Ken over in,

529
00:33:27.331 --> 00:33:28.560
in and I don't know,

530
00:33:28.561 --> 00:33:31.800
I mean fuck this downtown Julie Brown down to it was like east coast,

531
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:35.880
east coast and then I and Ed lover.
Yeah,
other Dr Dre.
Yeah.

532
00:33:35.881 --> 00:33:37.440
And then I was sitting there,
I'm like fuck,

533
00:33:37.441 --> 00:33:39.450
I got to get on there and then it just,
you know,

534
00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.430
I don't want to break down the whole story,

535
00:33:41.431 --> 00:33:45.960
but once I got on there it was something that was completely different and,

536
00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:49.380
and the timing for me,
I was developing my stand up.

537
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:53.400
I was 17 when I first started doing standup and then,

538
00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:57.030
and then my timing,
I think I was like 20 when I got on.

539
00:33:57.031 --> 00:33:58.480
I mean you have to understand something.
Wow.

540
00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:03.030
I was on MTV and my twenties in my twenties that's why your balls are drained.

541
00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:09.420
There must've been so much mocks thrown on the streets.

542
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:14.010
That's awesome.
Oh wait a minute.
You start doing standards.
Yeah,

543
00:34:14.011 --> 00:34:16.350
make twenties yeah.
Wait,
no,
my movies,

544
00:34:16.351 --> 00:34:19.890
all my movies was in my twenties it's not like I did my movies and my thirties

545
00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:25.130
my career like started to go down when I like had my run and uh,

546
00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:28.590
in my thirties okay.
You know what I mean?

547
00:34:28.591 --> 00:34:31.020
That's after all the movies and all the,
all the stuff.

548
00:34:31.021 --> 00:34:33.530
Like that's when I stopped getting offers and all that shit.
Yeah.

549
00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:37.710
[inaudible] offer stop because of like a bad cause movies.

550
00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:41.820
The movie business is real crazy in that it's like,
just like in stand up,

551
00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:43.320
it's like ticket sales driven I think.

552
00:34:43.321 --> 00:34:45.690
I think I just didn't do with Dave Chappelle did,

553
00:34:45.691 --> 00:34:49.620
which was he stopped while he was ahead for me.
You know what I mean?

554
00:34:49.621 --> 00:34:53.040
In this should be a learning lessons to everyone out there when your stock is

555
00:34:53.041 --> 00:34:57.960
high,
like back off,
you know d c I a little bit.
Yeah.

556
00:34:57.961 --> 00:35:02.060
Like stop.
Like,
like for instance,
like I could have stopped after son-in-law.

557
00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:05.910
Yeah.
Do you have any favorite movie by the way?
The most fantastic.

558
00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:09.520
It's hilarious.
It's a fun thank you by the way.
Thank you.
Your Dad's got,

559
00:35:09.521 --> 00:35:12.600
gets says yes.
It is hilarious.
Fun.
It's a great movie.

560
00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.540
You made a lot of great movies.
Yeah,
I made it.

561
00:35:14.541 --> 00:35:17.520
I made some really fun movies that I liked.
I like,

562
00:35:17.521 --> 00:35:20.940
and I see my movies now and I love all of them,
but my point is,

563
00:35:20.941 --> 00:35:25.190
is that I wasn't thinking all I want to do is work.
Right.

564
00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:27.810
Do you know what I mean?
Like you like,
like they're like,
oh,

565
00:35:27.811 --> 00:35:30.000
you're going to star in a movie and it's going to be about,

566
00:35:30.001 --> 00:35:33.360
you're going to be on jury duty and there's going to be Stanley to cheese in it

567
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:36.990
and you've got all these great actors in it and,
and you know,
Tia career,

568
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:39.960
a Wayne's world involvement.
And I'm like,
fuck,
that sounds good.
Of course,

569
00:35:39.961 --> 00:35:44.430
jury duty sounds Hilarious,
but you know,
I didn't work good with the director.

570
00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:47.460
The producer,
the script was weird.
The,
you know,

571
00:35:47.461 --> 00:35:49.080
everything was like didn't line up.

572
00:35:49.081 --> 00:35:53.760
It wasn't like it lined up on my other films and because I was above my name was

573
00:35:53.761 --> 00:35:57.850
above the title.
I fucking suffered from it.
Right.
You know what I mean?

574
00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:00.730
<v 2>By the way.
I've always wanted to ask this to somebody with your,
like,</v>

575
00:36:00.731 --> 00:36:03.250
with the experience of doing that,
when you're making a movie,

576
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:05.320
do you have the best thing in the world?

577
00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:07.630
I imagine that literally the best thing in the world,

578
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:10.810
you ever have any sense when the movie's being shot?

579
00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:13.510
Do you sense like this is not going to go well?

580
00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:15.500
Like do you feel that on the ones that kind of,

581
00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.940
<v 5>yeah,
kind of.
But then you also,</v>

582
00:36:17.941 --> 00:36:21.450
it's like when I did I bring back the Steven Miller video just because it was my

583
00:36:21.451 --> 00:36:23.160
last recent thing that did well.

584
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:27.480
Like I did that and I didn't know I was going to wind up on CNN being talking to

585
00:36:27.481 --> 00:36:28.910
like one of the CNN newsroom.
Yeah.

586
00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:32.620
<v 2>That was really funny for people that don't know though.
Stephen Miller,
uh,</v>

587
00:36:32.621 --> 00:36:34.240
works in the Trump administration.

588
00:36:34.241 --> 00:36:39.180
He's one of the presidential aids and he came out and like basically took them

589
00:36:39.181 --> 00:36:40.014
Mike one day.

590
00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:44.770
Now this is on the way of Spicer going out and really talked a lot of shit to a

591
00:36:44.771 --> 00:36:48.320
lot of the reports.
Hilarious.
And,
uh,
and then,
and then,
uh,

592
00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:52.810
Polly did like a parody of it where he had like the,
the fucking horse shoe,

593
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:56.710
the bald head.
And it's very funny man.
It was beautiful.
Thank you.
Thank you.

594
00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:59.320
See that's a funny or die funny or die.

595
00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:03.760
But my point is is that you do things in you,
you know,

596
00:37:03.761 --> 00:37:08.710
you can't control all the other antics that happens so you can just do what you

597
00:37:08.711 --> 00:37:13.330
do and then,
and then it's like it's in God's hands,
you know,
as far as a hit,

598
00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:17.890
you just don't know.
You don't know when you have an outcome.
But in retrospect,

599
00:37:17.891 --> 00:37:22.510
do you feel like you would have strategized in,
in terms of like,
absolutely.

600
00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.760
<v 5>I'll take my agents and managers told me not to do it.</v>

601
00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:29.570
Of course they are like,
you know,
even when I did in the army,

602
00:37:29.571 --> 00:37:32.090
now they told me not to do that because I had got a,

603
00:37:32.091 --> 00:37:35.450
I just signed a three picture deal at Disney and I didn't see no man.

604
00:37:35.451 --> 00:37:37.760
First they did son in law and the next they,

605
00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:40.790
Jeffrey Katzenberg who is running Disney at the time wanted me to do another

606
00:37:40.791 --> 00:37:44.780
movie there.
And new line came to me with this other film called totally London,

607
00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:49.730
which was basically me playing an AU pair in London,
you know like poly Poppins,

608
00:37:49.731 --> 00:37:53.810
like where I go,
where I go over there,
you know,
if my slang or whatever it is,

609
00:37:53.811 --> 00:37:57.650
and I live with this kind of English family and,
and we wanted to do that.

610
00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:00.410
But because I was in bed with Disney and Jeffrey Katzenberg,

611
00:38:00.411 --> 00:38:03.230
they wouldn't get me out of that deal.
So Jeffrey said,
shut up,

612
00:38:03.231 --> 00:38:04.370
you're going to do this movie.

613
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:08.510
And that's what we did in the army now and in the army now did well like now

614
00:38:08.511 --> 00:38:10.910
it's made its money after years of it being out there.

615
00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:14.930
But at the time it didn't do as good as the other movies did.
So that was like,

616
00:38:14.931 --> 00:38:19.920
and then I cut my hair and I was so known for my hair,
my hair.

617
00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:22.360
Can we please talk about,
are we going to cut Dahlia's hair?

618
00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.710
We got to take it up because he's getting too much paper

619
00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:30.280
<v 2>for me.
You want a mean?
Yeah.
That doesn't work for me.</v>

620
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:36.010
He though I

621
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:36.910
<v 0>feel like the weasel,</v>

622
00:38:36.911 --> 00:38:41.710
you could've found that guy anywhere on the sunset sunset strip and that era of,

623
00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:45.130
of time,
because it was like the,
the metal clubs.
You remember.
I'm like,

624
00:38:45.131 --> 00:38:49.000
the sunset strip was kinda that dude very well.
Could have been living there.

625
00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:52.960
How did you,
how did he come to you,
first of all,
before you even answer that,

626
00:38:52.961 --> 00:38:57.680
can we start so that people know that Pauly,
like where he grew up?
Oh my God.

627
00:38:57.850 --> 00:38:59.530
You're the craziest life ever.

628
00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:02.960
<v 5>Like would they like,
so that they know the background,
your,
your mother,</v>

629
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:07.640
Mitzi shore.
Um,
the,
Oh my God.
Yeah.

630
00:39:07.641 --> 00:39:11.130
It just goes out when you mentioned my mom.
I know.
See me don't,

631
00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:15.330
don't bring me in on this bull shit.
Leave me alone.
I don't want to have a fee.

632
00:39:15.331 --> 00:39:19.670
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.
So areas like Holly's mom,
you know,

633
00:39:19.671 --> 00:39:24.671
ran the comedy store and Paulie basically grew up at the comedy store with his

634
00:39:25.551 --> 00:39:30.080
dad's a comment.
Yes,
of course.
And,
uh,
I met your dad and,
and uh,
there's,

635
00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:34.010
you know,
he's got Sam Kennison babysitting him and crazy.

636
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:38.600
Rodney and I just as crazy as thriving.
He was the best.
Really?
Oh my God.

637
00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:43.450
So hilarious.
Just always,
oh yeah,
he was the best.
I believe that.
Yeah.

638
00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:46.850
He was the bass and sweetheart and funny and all that stuff.

639
00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:50.570
To Christina's point,
do you at an early age,
because it's almost,

640
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:53.180
it seems normal to you.
Do you go like,
I'm going to do this,

641
00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:54.420
I'm going to do what all these people are?
Well,

642
00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:57.380
I have two brothers and a sister and they're not into it.

643
00:39:57.381 --> 00:39:59.390
So it's like they grew up in it as well.
I mean,

644
00:39:59.391 --> 00:40:03.170
you guys know you guys are straight comics.
You guys are hardcore comics.

645
00:40:03.171 --> 00:40:05.660
Like you don't choose it.
It chooses you like,

646
00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.460
like you live fucking in the valley.

647
00:40:07.461 --> 00:40:09.200
Like you guys have to drive to the comedy store.

648
00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:11.950
Do you think you like driving the comedy store?
No.
Yeah.

649
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:13.820
But you fucking know once you get up there,

650
00:40:13.821 --> 00:40:17.300
you're gonna have that feeling and that you know that it's especially like you

651
00:40:17.301 --> 00:40:19.940
guys got to drive to the fucking airport.
Yeah.
And flight,

652
00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:22.250
you know all over America.
Do you like that?
No,

653
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:24.660
but you know what's going to happen when you get there,
right?

654
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:28.280
People are going to be there for you and your heart is going to be open.

655
00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:31.070
You're going to feel this like stressful lever,
you know what I mean?

656
00:40:31.071 --> 00:40:34.790
So is your first time on stage at the store?
No,

657
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:38.540
I stayed away from it for about two years.
But you were like did your mom,

658
00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:41.420
because I knew why I started when I was like 17.

659
00:40:41.421 --> 00:40:45.710
I started when I went to Beverly Hills high school and I was like in a,
I was in,

660
00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:49.430
it was in high school is at the beginning of 12th grade and all my friends were

661
00:40:49.431 --> 00:40:53.570
going to college.
They were taking the sat papers and I'm like,
okay,

662
00:40:53.571 --> 00:40:55.480
now I've got to start.
So I just started.

663
00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:57.590
Angel Salads are actually wrote my first joke.

664
00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:04.940
He wrote my first joke.
So,
uh,
so he got me,
he got these,
I got these comics,

665
00:41:04.941 --> 00:41:07.430
let's start kind of writing me jokes cause I didn't know how to write jokes.

666
00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:11.390
And then my dad took me to my first gig.
He did dad with you?
Yeah,

667
00:41:11.391 --> 00:41:13.860
my dad's pretty cool.
Yeah,
it is.
It's called the city.
Yeah.

668
00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:17.800
<v 0>Feel pressure because it was your father or did you feel supported because it</v>

669
00:41:17.801 --> 00:41:19.600
was your father?
Do you know what I mean?
It can be either way.

670
00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:24.770
<v 5>Um,
no,
he was cool.
He was cool.
My Dad was cool,
you know,</v>

671
00:41:24.771 --> 00:41:26.570
but I always like,
you know,
it was,

672
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:29.450
it was just one of those things that I always knew I was going to do and like,

673
00:41:29.451 --> 00:41:30.500
okay,
now I'm going to do it.

674
00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:34.190
But I stayed away from the store for two years and there was a club called the

675
00:41:34.191 --> 00:41:38.130
alley cat B's.
Strowe and that was it.
No,
that was where,
that was my first time.

676
00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.690
No,
the La Cabaret was a club in the valley.
Do you remember it?

677
00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:45.710
It's not there anymore though.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't mean that was so long ago.

678
00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:50.750
So a guy named ray bishop who used to own an argus Hamilton,

679
00:41:50.751 --> 00:41:52.130
used to get me spots there.

680
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:55.760
And then I worked with Jamie at the laugh factory for years.
Yeah.

681
00:41:55.761 --> 00:41:59.690
So I stayed away from the store and then the first time I went on from my mom,

682
00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:04.580
I showcased for her.
And then what kind of pressure is that?

683
00:42:04.581 --> 00:42:06.610
Terrifying or,
yeah,
it was a nightmare.
It was,

684
00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:08.810
it was a nightmare because I also figured you're either going to be like,

685
00:42:08.811 --> 00:42:11.990
no was no big deal or yeah,
it's a fucking night.
Know.
It was fucking terrible.

686
00:42:11.991 --> 00:42:16.970
I was 19,
you know what I mean?
And she tell you,
well,
let me finish.

687
00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:22.860
No,
uh,
no.
So,
so Paul Mooney in lieu in,
uh,

688
00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:27.410
Paul Mooney and Louie Anderson were sitting next to her in the booth,

689
00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.080
her booth.
So I go on stage,
it's packed.

690
00:42:30.081 --> 00:42:32.510
Obviously there's like a wall full of comics.

691
00:42:32.511 --> 00:42:35.060
I don't want to say they hate my guts,
but it's Mitzi son,
you know,

692
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:38.780
so they're like in the way back.
So I'm like,
I'm like on stage,

693
00:42:38.781 --> 00:42:42.250
I'm doing these really bad jokes that angel told me that I wrote for me.

694
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:46.160
I grew up in Beverly hills,
my mom's Mexican,
whatever.
What am I just,
sorry.

695
00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:50.480
I say my jokes,
no lapse.
So at the end I break out and start pop locking.

696
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:51.750
I had this boombox,

697
00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:55.370
we played freakazoid and I put this mask on and I stuck because I was good at

698
00:42:55.371 --> 00:42:59.120
pop locking.
Yeah.
So I started popping and then after I went off stage,

699
00:42:59.121 --> 00:43:01.190
I ended good.
I have to,
I'm like,
how did I do it?
She's like,

700
00:43:01.191 --> 00:43:05.480
stick with the dancing.
My mom sits gig with the dancing and then she's like,

701
00:43:05.481 --> 00:43:07.520
get away from me.
It was like pretty bad.
Yeah.

702
00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:13.200
So like it's not till I became famous on MTV and I was like drawing people in

703
00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:17.740
the main room that she like made me a paid regular.
Yeah.
Yeah.

704
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:19.430
Like I literally had to stay away.

705
00:43:19.431 --> 00:43:22.420
And then I worked with Tennyson for a long time.
Why did you wait?
Hold on.

706
00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:24.380
When did you with Kennison?
What do you mean you worked with him?

707
00:43:24.381 --> 00:43:27.650
You Open for him?
Yeah,
I opened for him.
Wow.
That was cool.

708
00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:30.980
So is that the birth of the weasel?
The weasel back?

709
00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:36.440
I'd have to say it was Kinda like all my friends used to call me the weasel.

710
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:40.460
They did?
Yeah.
Like when I was younger.
And then a lot of comics like Jackson,

711
00:43:40.461 --> 00:43:44.630
Purdue,
he's the city,
you're a weasel.
And then I was always like waste.

712
00:43:44.631 --> 00:43:47.810
So like I'm the one that Kinda came up with that.
And then I was like,

713
00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:51.860
if someone could,
if that noise can actually occur,

714
00:43:51.861 --> 00:43:54.930
what would that noise sound like?
And I was like,
you know,

715
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:56.330
that's where the thinking.

716
00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:01.100
And then I started like pausing between my words that was on MTV,

717
00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:03.980
that was like,
I would look in the camera and be like,

718
00:44:03.981 --> 00:44:07.640
check out this video broke cause it's going to be made.
Sure.

719
00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:12.490
And then I start crying,
grind it,

720
00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.600
and then I would just start making shit up.

721
00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:18.620
And then it was like my own language to the audience.
And then,

722
00:44:18.621 --> 00:44:19.820
and then from there,
you know,

723
00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:22.300
I was like kind of had my own slang to the audience.

724
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:27.080
The juice that was from Encino.
Man,
Julie's you use.

725
00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:32.010
So that's how it took off thing about it is like as a kid too know,
like,
uh,

726
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:36.030
<v 2>somebody who's a little bit older than you and is cool.
So cool.</v>

727
00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:38.520
And then when you learn slang because you're as a kid,
it's like,

728
00:44:38.521 --> 00:44:42.030
what does that mean?
Yeah.
So like it was hearing the slang on MTV,

729
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:44.910
but then in the movies too,
that you're like,
aw man.

730
00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:47.860
And then you do it on the playground.
You do it cool.

731
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:51.450
Like we're all doing crazy Pauly shore at school.
It was pretty cool.
Yeah,

732
00:44:51.451 --> 00:44:52.920
it was cool.
Yeah,
that's wow.

733
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.210
<v 5>It was like the best,
I mean,
it was like,
people are always like,
oh,</v>

734
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:59.630
you always hear,
people are like,
oh,
why do you talk about your passing?

735
00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:02.630
I'm not just me.
Just people in general.
You know what I mean?
We'll show you,

736
00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:05.220
you live here pass.
And I'm like,
well,
you didn't live in my past.
Yeah.

737
00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:08.350
You know what I mean?
My Pass was insane.
Yeah,
of course.
You know,
it was,

738
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:09.280
it was pretty fucking.
Yeah.

739
00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:12.870
<v 6>Cool.
So can you been on a ride that most people never will?
Never will.</v>

740
00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:15.270
Can I ask you,
cause I had,
my mother's gone now,

741
00:45:15.271 --> 00:45:20.271
but I had a mother who very much disapproved of me and never really gave me the

742
00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:25.140
thumbs up the approval.
I so desired like,

743
00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:29.130
do you think there's a time that your mother saw your career and,
and went like,

744
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:31.280
yeah.
You did it.
Yeah,
she gave it to him

745
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.200
pretty much and that looks good on them.
I wish I would have had a daughter.

746
00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:43.440
<v 5>Um,
yeah.
You know,
when I became famous on MTV and I was fine,</v>

747
00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:47.740
I took her to the MTV awards,
you know,
I was with dating a porno star newer,

748
00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:50.160
so she liked that.
Yeah.
She was like,
who are you dating?

749
00:45:50.161 --> 00:45:51.810
Is it a well known name was Savannah.

750
00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:55.730
<v 6>Oh,
I know Susanna.
She's popular on the stern show.
Yeah.
Don't they?</v>

751
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:58.380
Don't they play it?
She's been dead for a long time.
She came over myself.

752
00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:01.980
Oh my God.
I'm sorry.
No,
but probably may hope.

753
00:46:01.981 --> 00:46:03.840
I hope not difference.

754
00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:10.530
<v 5>No.
Uh,
no,
this,
this was 1994,
so,
uh,</v>

755
00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:13.950
yeah.
So,
uh,
yeah,
my mom was cool.
Obviously,
like,

756
00:46:13.951 --> 00:46:18.210
so liberal and so like whatever.
My mom never judged and that's out.

757
00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:21.840
That's what I loved about my mom.
And that's like me.
Like I don't judge people,

758
00:46:21.841 --> 00:46:24.900
like if you're a heroin addict,
whoa,
cool.
That's your thing.
Like,

759
00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:26.190
you know what I mean?
Like,
yeah,

760
00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.920
people have to go through what they have to go through in life.
And,

761
00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:34.250
and my mom was such,
you know,
that my mom was such an artist.
Like she was so she,

762
00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:37.100
her heart was the comics.
That's where her well at,
sir.
Come on.

763
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:41.850
And it actually started with my dad because my dad met her when he was cheering

764
00:46:41.851 --> 00:46:46.620
in the 50s and my dad was touring in any,
any did a,
a camp.

765
00:46:46.621 --> 00:46:49.710
He did a,
it was a summer camp in Elkhart Lake,
Wisconsin.

766
00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:52.320
And my dad was the comic there.
And my mom used to,

767
00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:55.700
my mom used to type up his jokes because she was,

768
00:46:56.100 --> 00:47:00.330
because she was the assistant for the owner,
the owner of the camp,

769
00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:04.130
and she'd be like,
do this one,
do that.
So it was like a natural thing.
Yeah.

770
00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:06.540
So that was her thing.
Yeah.

771
00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:08.670
<v 2>Did.
Um,
then that's so,</v>

772
00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:10.600
well now I don't know if you've been asked this a million times,

773
00:47:10.601 --> 00:47:15.130
so forgive me if you have,
but do you have any opinion on the showtime series?

774
00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:16.053
I'm dying up here.

775
00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:17.470
<v 5>Um,
I,
you know,</v>

776
00:47:17.471 --> 00:47:21.780
I told people a million times exactly my take on it for people.

777
00:47:21.781 --> 00:47:22.490
Just the people that,
that

778
00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:26.900
<v 2>don't know.
It's basically,
I mean,
it's executive produced by Jim Carrey and it's,</v>

779
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:30.280
you know,
it's a play on the,
what did they call

780
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:35.500
<v 6>your mom's character?
Not winning many or something.</v>

781
00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:39.820
You're right.
So it's like a woman running the club.
I mean,
it's obviously,

782
00:47:39.821 --> 00:47:43.390
it's supposed to be symbolized Mitzi,
but,
sorry.
So just so people know.

783
00:47:43.391 --> 00:47:46.840
So when I see,
I tell every time I see Erik Griffin,
I was like,
dude,

784
00:47:46.841 --> 00:47:50.620
I'm suing you bro.
Like you're playing a,
playing it wrong.
I'm coming after you.

785
00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:53.910
He's like,
it's not me.
I'm like,
dude,
I don't give a fuck attorneys,

786
00:47:53.911 --> 00:47:55.250
they're going to,
you're going to be getting a cop.

787
00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:03.640
No.
Uh,
no.
I guess it's,
you know,
I mean,

788
00:48:03.641 --> 00:48:07.450
Jim Carey,
you know,
he,
it's his take on the whole thing,
right?

789
00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:11.860
So it's not my take.
It's not my mom's take,
it's not my dad's steak.
It's his day.

790
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:15.670
That's true.
So that's the first thing.
The second thing,
I look at it,

791
00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:19.660
I look at it at two,
two things.
I look at it.
Number one,
do I like this as a show?

792
00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:20.320
You know,

793
00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.990
and you just kind of sitting there and watching it and I think it's kind of cool

794
00:48:22.991 --> 00:48:27.050
cause I like kind of historical shows.
I like shows from the 60 70 days.

795
00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:30.880
I'm like that,
that era.
And then you look at it as a show show,

796
00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:34.180
not really feeling it that much.
You know what I mean?

797
00:48:34.181 --> 00:48:38.380
I'm not really connecting with people.
Does that make sense?
Yeah,
absolutely.

798
00:48:38.381 --> 00:48:42.040
Like I like,
I think they're all good actors,
but let's be honest,

799
00:48:42.041 --> 00:48:46.390
they're not all good act.
I mean not to,
not to disrespect any of them,

800
00:48:46.391 --> 00:48:50.020
but they're not real actors there comedians that are acting.

801
00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.790
Does that make sense?
Because I watched the whole series.

802
00:48:56.710 --> 00:49:00.190
It's about standup and I know these people,
I think they made it too heavy.

803
00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:02.540
It was too fucking dark.
It was like,

804
00:49:02.541 --> 00:49:04.650
I'm going to kill myself if I don't get on the main stem.

805
00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:07.180
Imagine if that was done with real good actors,

806
00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:10.140
then that would be pretty kind of cool.
No,
I don't know.

807
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:12.650
I don't know if it's the acting or the fact that,
I mean,
imagine if like there,

808
00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:15.160
Sean Penn's we're doing it.
Who are the,
who was like,

809
00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:19.360
our generation is Sean Penn's and like in Robert Downey and those type of guys,

810
00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:22.840
you know,
where they kind of really becoming,
they should have cast I think,

811
00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:27.490
I don't know,
maybe Gosling.
I don't know though.

812
00:49:27.491 --> 00:49:31.570
I don't know.
I don't know.
I think it's a fair to,
I mean I like,
I like your take.

813
00:49:31.571 --> 00:49:34.600
That's a very honest take and I don't think there's anything wrong with it.
Um,

814
00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:38.410
but I'm happy that it's got picked up for a second season and it's because it's

815
00:49:38.411 --> 00:49:42.370
cool for the guys.
You know,
when they got,
they got,

816
00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:45.310
they got a Gig,
you know what I mean?
At the end of the day,

817
00:49:45.311 --> 00:49:49.540
you get to fucking show up and act for fucking three months on a show.

818
00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:54.370
What's better than that?
It's great.
You know what I mean?
So do you,
um,

819
00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:59.950
do you,
um,
so how did the,
doesn't know what to ask me.
I think it's finished.

820
00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:02.090
[inaudible] Bro.

821
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:12.550
Sorry.
You can cut that part out if you
slow it down.
So wait,

822
00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:15.910
I want to do,
how do Steven Miller thing come about when,

823
00:50:15.911 --> 00:50:19.360
I mean obviously that happened,
but how did you do?
They just asked me to do it.

824
00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:22.960
They just,
they just thought of you.
I do,
I do funny or die stuff a lot,

825
00:50:22.961 --> 00:50:25.870
so I'm always doing stuff for them.
So they just,
Sean Boyle,

826
00:50:25.871 --> 00:50:28.190
who's a friend of mine over there,
it with Mike Fair,
they're just,

827
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:29.270
<v 5>hey,
you know,</v>

828
00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:32.720
Stephen Miller just did this thing on CNN and we want you to play the blah blah

829
00:50:32.721 --> 00:50:36.080
blah.
And I'm like,
okay.
And the next day I went in and did it and they put it up,

830
00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:38.810
<v 6>you know?
Yeah.
What about you guys?
How did you guys,</v>

831
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:43.500
I mean this is an interesting thing.
Well,
no,
no,
you're right.

832
00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:46.600
It's not supposed to work.
I mean,
you mean you saw,

833
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:49.470
you've seen it with your parents like two people,
a cook.

834
00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:51.110
<v 5>Mom was in a comic.</v>

835
00:50:51.111 --> 00:50:55.280
You guys are full on really good comedians that are successful and you're

836
00:50:55.281 --> 00:50:58.520
working.
This is a sitcom.
You got to develop it in a show

837
00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:02.940
<v 6>for sure.
Oh God.
It's great financing yourself though.</v>

838
00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:05.450
100% yeah,

839
00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:10.460
do it Louis C K did except for the other party can reason with no cause you can

840
00:51:11.071 --> 00:51:14.340
produce it.
Get a young producer and there and just pay for it half,

841
00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:18.600
half and then just shoot whatever it is you want.
Edited,
sizzle,
sizzle,

842
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:23.460
get up man.
And I work because we started at the same time.
Oh that's cute.

843
00:51:23.461 --> 00:51:27.710
Tommy.
Tom,
Tom Seger.

844
00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:32.700
I mean literally since he was 23 I watched him.

845
00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:35.680
I think I met you like the fifth time you went on stage.

846
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:41.940
We were rooting for each other like coming in at different levels

847
00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:50.680
but the weasel is he going to get when your baby,
when your baby came out?

848
00:51:50.681 --> 00:51:55.230
I did.
You have did three minutes.
Just Atlanta Boys,
my head.

849
00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:04.530
Oh my God.
It's definitely a show there.
I mean for sure.

850
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:07.530
Like on the road who opens for

851
00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:11.410
Natasha and

852
00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:15.910
that we didn't do,

853
00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:20.610
we didn't do that dynamic because trouble better to keep it separate.

854
00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:24.450
That's the first episode.

855
00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:27.630
And then you guys do and it's a disaster and you guys are just filing for

856
00:52:27.631 --> 00:52:31.980
divorce.
That's a good angle,
right?

857
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:36.270
Larry Sanders
will never work together again.

858
00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:42.210
I think that'd be great.

859
00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:50.680
Yeah.
I got a 50th birthday coming up and you're going to do a book.
I should.

860
00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:51.713
Oh my God.

861
00:52:52.590 --> 00:52:57.240
<v 5>I got so many things.
I got two documentaries.
I have,
um,
I have,</v>

862
00:52:57.241 --> 00:53:01.610
uh,
about three years ago I did stands along,
which was on showtime,

863
00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:05.490
which is a straight doc and now I have a doc series based off of that and that's

864
00:53:05.491 --> 00:53:09.930
a six part series and I've finished.
That's fucking,
I think,
not to pat myself,

865
00:53:09.931 --> 00:53:12.360
but I think it's the best thing I've ever done.
It's very emotional.

866
00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:17.370
I moved my mom out of the house.
It's fucking heavy,
dude.
Good.
Toby,
excuse me.

867
00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:19.983
<v 6>Just</v>

868
00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:25.740
going to put a ring on this finger or what are you going to with Whitney

869
00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:27.780
Cummings?
You're going to marry her?
I to it really keeps the,

870
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:31.230
she keeps ignoring me.
I just wanted to get her pregnant.
Yeah,

871
00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:34.290
do really into animals.
You just have to start letting the animal

872
00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:41.130
do get her a horse and have a horse.
I want to say it.

873
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:46.470
I don't know.
I mean I'm,
I'm,
it's like bungee jumping from me.

874
00:53:46.471 --> 00:53:49.410
Like I kind of liked being alone.
I mean,
I have a girlfriend now.

875
00:53:49.411 --> 00:53:52.650
I've been seeing her for a while.
We have a nice relationship,

876
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:55.440
but it's really difficult for me.
You know what I mean?

877
00:53:55.441 --> 00:53:59.910
It's difficult for me to just be with someone all the time to come home.

878
00:53:59.911 --> 00:54:02.910
Like I like coming home and I'm by myself.
I kind of liked that.
Well,

879
00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:07.230
we were just talking about how we go away for the holidays to avoid family.

880
00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:11.960
I don't necessarily enjoy hanging out with all my family members and that's just

881
00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:14.820
your wiring and I respect that you know that about yourself because there are

882
00:54:14.821 --> 00:54:17.910
some men that aren't supposed to have families.
I don't think.
Honestly,

883
00:54:17.911 --> 00:54:21.480
my dad was supposed to be a family guy.
He stuck around.
He did his duty,

884
00:54:21.481 --> 00:54:25.130
but my dad enjoyed it.
It was miserable.

885
00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:30.330
I was miserable.
My parents divorced when I was three years old,

886
00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:35.460
but before that I,
you know,
I have
two brothers and a sister,

887
00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:37.470
but my oldest brother is Scott.

888
00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:42.710
He's like 64 and my sister's like 60 to 60 so it's like

889
00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:47.460
a long time.
When do my debt,
Whoa,
sorry about that.

890
00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:50.130
My Dad's fucking 90 years old.

891
00:54:50.131 --> 00:54:54.660
My Mom's 87 so it's like they were doing it a long time ago and then they

892
00:54:54.661 --> 00:54:57.090
stopped and then they had me and my brother Peter.

893
00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:00.750
So me and Peter were pretty much raised at the store.
You know what I mean?

894
00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:03.960
The whole time while mom was dating our guests and in dating,

895
00:55:03.961 --> 00:55:08.460
like Danny stone and all these different comedians and I was just there running

896
00:55:08.461 --> 00:55:12.480
around and artists still visits her,
right?
Like,
yeah,
he's like very dedicated.

897
00:55:12.481 --> 00:55:15.030
That's,
yeah,
that's very sweet.
It's very sweet.

898
00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:18.900
He would Garry Shandling visitor too,
and then he left and he passed away.

899
00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:24.000
Not Good.
Why are you laughing?
That's not cool.
That's politically incorrect.

900
00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:28.530
This,
what seen what movies is from one of my favorite scenes.

901
00:55:28.531 --> 00:55:30.240
I forget what movie this is from.
Of you

902
00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:33.360
<v 7>breath.
God's love to fuck.
Fuck.
Look,</v>

903
00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:39.150
if you're a hot black guy and you want to fuck me a 2195 if you want to move in,

904
00:55:39.461 --> 00:55:44.060
you can move in.
But you got to fuck the,
I try my movie.
It's not,

905
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:48.290
<v 6>oh no,
no,
no.
That's the wrong clip.</v>

906
00:55:49.070 --> 00:55:53.320
Publicist sent us the wrong trailer.
I am my publicist.
Oh Shit.

907
00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:57.710
We got the fucking bamboozled.
Holly,
what do you think is going on in that clip?

908
00:55:58.610 --> 00:56:03.380
I don't know.
I don't know who.
I don't even know if that looked like sandy.
Dan.

909
00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:04.293
<v 7>No.</v>

910
00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:07.930
<v 6>Oh,
we don't know.</v>

911
00:56:07.930 --> 00:56:11.020
It's a guy on the Internet who just gave out his address and one a black guys to

912
00:56:11.021 --> 00:56:14.500
come over and fuck him.
And if you're out of jail,
do piss on him.
Come on him.

913
00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:19.050
Whatever.
Try now since it's a family show,
it's his mother's house.
Your mom's.

914
00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:23.830
That's true.
It's not,
yeah.
You music,
right?

915
00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:28.480
Uh,
are you a fan of the show?
Gigolos on showtime.

916
00:56:29.310 --> 00:56:32.680
We not seen it in a while and seen it.
Well,
it's about,

917
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:37.160
there's a bunch of mail hose on showtime and it follows them around,
you know,

918
00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:40.700
turn in their tricks and their lives and stuff.
I haven't seen it.
Oh.

919
00:56:40.810 --> 00:56:44.020
One of the guys on there is a musician.
He has a new music video out.
Um,

920
00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:48.240
and they asked us to take a look at it.
So let's give us your honest take.
Yeah.

921
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:04.820
<v 1>I love this song.</v>

922
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:09.130
<v 6>You do?
Yeah.
I like the song.
I don't know their version of,
it's a little,
oh wait,</v>

923
00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:13.110
wait.
You know this,
I know this song,
right?
It's someone else's song.
I Dunno.

924
00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:16.900
Is it?
Yeah,
that was wrecking ball.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh,
well,

925
00:57:17.350 --> 00:57:20.140
he did a remake of it.
I didn't know that.
Got good ear.

926
00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.233
<v 1>Yes.</v>

927
00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:46.120
<v 6>Are they going to start fucking or what?
No.</v>

928
00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:49.970
Come on already and want them to bang or Vegas baby.
That's it.

929
00:57:50.010 --> 00:57:51.110
That's all that's happening.

930
00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:54.333
<v 1>Sure.</v>

931
00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:59.220
<v 6>That's cool.
Cool.
Cool.
All right.
Anyways,
it's,
no,</v>

932
00:58:00.130 --> 00:58:04.120
no.
Lisa,
Lisa,
no one I adore.
Yeah,

933
00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:09.220
that was funny,
man.
That was good.
I'm a stony,
crusty dude.
Yeah,

934
00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:13.080
no,
it was Lisa Real,
was it based on a real Lisa?
Yeah.

935
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.010
Where is she now?

936
00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:19.370
She lives in Nashville with her kids.

937
00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:24.930
You're going to try and make a baby though,
right?
I think so.
Really?
Yeah.

938
00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:28.890
I think that that makes sense to me.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

939
00:58:29.050 --> 00:58:32.620
But I keep pulling out.
You gotta stop.
You gotta stop.

940
00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:35.030
You gotta leave out of this full loads all the way inside.
Yeah.

941
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:37.450
Missing the vagina.
Yeah.
Right.

942
00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:40.490
You can't do a half a load and then it gives me and then Joo out go,
wait,

943
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.560
no I didn't.
And you also got to,

944
00:58:42.561 --> 00:58:44.710
you got to make sure she lays still there after a while.

945
00:58:44.711 --> 00:58:49.220
It's hard to not move your legs up,
legs up.
I heard if you do it doggy style,

946
00:58:49.221 --> 00:58:49.901
then it's a boy.

947
00:58:49.901 --> 00:58:52.960
And if it's standard then it's a girl hold it until her children.
That's true.

948
00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:56.190
Yup.
So what do you guys have?
We have a boy.
Yeah.

949
00:58:56.350 --> 00:59:00.000
So you did her dog dog food to

950
00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:02.890
Valet Park.
Yeah,

951
00:59:02.891 --> 00:59:07.891
we did 69 we were talking about people do people really 60 to 69 like a thing

952
00:59:10.481 --> 00:59:14.040
you do.
Once in high school and then the long time not good.
He's like,

953
00:59:14.041 --> 00:59:18.910
I know I don't do that now.
Right.
It's kind of weird
like,

954
00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:22.220
wait,
you guys are live in the valley.
You guys live in a valley house.

955
00:59:22.221 --> 00:59:25.850
So do you guys have sex in the valley and stuff?
This is cool.

956
00:59:25.851 --> 00:59:29.570
Like you guys got neighbors and stuff,
you know,
suburban,

957
00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:34.940
suburban.
Let's cause we have a kid.
I mean,
where the fuck do you raise your kid?

958
00:59:34.941 --> 00:59:38.090
I grew up in La.
I grew up out here.
You grew up in the valley?

959
00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:43.700
Birmingham?
No,
I went to Louisville.
All Girls Catholic.
But I had friends.

960
00:59:43.701 --> 00:59:47.450
I went to Birmingham.
So you're in the valley.
That's cool.

961
00:59:47.451 --> 00:59:48.560
But where are you from originally?

962
00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:51.350
<v 2>Originally I was born in Cincinnati,
but I moved,
I moved a lot.</v>

963
00:59:51.351 --> 00:59:55.910
So I lived in a lot of Midwest.
Yeah.
When did you start,

964
00:59:55.911 --> 00:59:59.370
where did you start doing your stand out here in la?
Which club?
Uh,

965
00:59:59.390 --> 01:00:04.390
well I started at like some of the bars and then I got in at Melrose first.

966
01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:07.670
The improv,
if you could say the problem in front of me,
it's okay.

967
01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:09.390
I don't want to upset you.

968
01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:13.060
<v 6>What's crazy is when I first started working the Improv's,</v>

969
01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:16.570
I actually put in my contract,
it was tea.

970
01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:20.560
I put a curtain in front of me because I didn't want someone to take a picture

971
01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:24.520
in front of the Improv sign.
Show it to my mom.
Yeah,
sure.
You know,

972
01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:29.410
cause that was like a very big,
you know,
feud growing up as a kid,
you know?

973
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:34.330
Of course.
Very important question.
Do you ever,
when you take a dump,

974
01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:39.130
do you ever go right to the shower from shit to shower?

975
01:00:39.131 --> 01:00:42.160
I'm not going to talk about that.
Why a good conversation

976
01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:47.320
all the time.
You think he wants to put that on there,
put that it's a bad energy.

977
01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:54.660
She's talking about,
she's talking about not even wiping.
No,
because no,

978
01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.820
she's done those jokes before on stage.

979
01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:00.280
I done some shit jokes before.

980
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:05.680
This is your mom's house.
We have to be real to the brand.

981
01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:07.013
<v 2>You know who</v>

982
01:01:08.770 --> 01:01:13.650
you know who I sat next to yesterday on my flight set directly next to me was

983
01:01:13.651 --> 01:01:17.200
Kenya and Martin.
Who's that?
I'll tell you exactly who that is.

984
01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:18.970
<v 8>Arm didn't go the way,
you know what I'm saying?</v>

985
01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:22.680
He made clear at the end it was a question and we'll try,
we'll call,

986
01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:24.050
you know what I'm saying?
I didn't go our way.

987
01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:29.870
I had a good look at see how to better look.
You know what I'm saying?

988
01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:33.870
<v 2>I mean for me,
I always just think of him as university of Cincinnati,</v>

989
01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:37.020
but he played in the NBA for,
I don't know,
it doesn't here.
He was a,

990
01:01:37.890 --> 01:01:41.220
I forget a bit of a journeyman.
Right.
He had a few teams.
Um,

991
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:46.050
let me look up his,
so he's,
he's retired now,
but I'm saying he's a,

992
01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:50.580
let's see what his,
his career was at big old fuck six,
nine.

993
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:57.210
He played for the nets.
The nuggets.
The clippers.
Yeah.

994
01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:02.010
Bucks.
Oh,
a whole bunch of teams.
Jersey.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Do you like sports?

995
01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:06.170
But he's one of the all of the all time.
You know what I'm saying?

996
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:08.320
<v 8>Oh,
it was just books and they made,</v>

997
01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:12.620
they made one more close and we did it the one night the game got out of
control.

998
01:02:12.621 --> 01:02:14.970
And so they came out with a lot of Angela,
which we knew there was going to do.

999
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:18.410
<v 2>I mean,
there's a lot of them,
you know what I'm saying?
I know what I'm saying.</v>

1000
01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:20.040
You know what I'm saying?
I know what I'm saying is

1001
01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:22.740
<v 0>what I'm sending for.
You know what I'm saying?</v>

1002
01:02:22.741 --> 01:02:25.230
He says we always like to highlight things.
They're really great.

1003
01:02:25.231 --> 01:02:26.064
You know what I'm saying?

1004
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:29.310
<v 5>So yeah,
I think that's the open for your show.
You know what I'm saying?</v>

1005
01:02:29.311 --> 01:02:32.400
Guys talk about you're in the kitchen and you're doing the kid thing and it just

1006
01:02:32.401 --> 01:02:36.570
turns into like,
look,
we're getting paid a lot of money.
You know,
and you're like,

1007
01:02:36.571 --> 01:02:39.420
yeah,
but that's the one thing we talked about.
We would never work together.

1008
01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:43.110
You know what I mean?
And then finally you just say fuck it,
let's do it,

1009
01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:44.161
let's just do it.

1010
01:02:44.161 --> 01:02:48.060
And then it's all this angst and he'd go up there and something bad happens,

1011
01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:50.970
you know what I mean?
And then like that's the end of the second act.

1012
01:02:50.971 --> 01:02:54.620
And then the third act is like,
you know,
you kind of deal with it.
And then like,

1013
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:55.463
you know,
you start,
yeah,

1014
01:02:55.850 --> 01:02:58.550
<v 0>I liked this premise because that is the one thing we've chosen.</v>

1015
01:02:58.730 --> 01:03:01.230
Because you know,
once you do a reality show,
it kills the marriage.
No,

1016
01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:03.110
you're not reality.
Just a straight script.

1017
01:03:03.111 --> 01:03:06.380
But I'm saying there's a reason we've never done certain things.
I,
I feel like,

1018
01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:09.170
yeah,
maybe unconsciously we knew that the thing that's cool.
Yeah,

1019
01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:09.761
<v 5>it is.</v>

1020
01:03:09.761 --> 01:03:14.761
You guys are both really talented and you guys can like do something different

1021
01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:18.850
because no one's done it.
No one's done it successfully.
Right.

1022
01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:24.940
The,
the,
the husband and the wife that are both true standups,
right?

1023
01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.080
I mean,
right.
Is there any,

1024
01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:30.190
<v 0>well,
I mean,
okay.
Lucien Reiki.
They weren't standing there.</v>

1025
01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:34.550
They came out of Vaudeville.
Who's the,
uh,
you're right.

1026
01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:39.170
There's not been too married,
true standups that have done no thank you.

1027
01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:42.610
It would be great.
And you just tweak it.
Wow.
Yeah.
It's a good idea.

1028
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:45.750
<v 5>Are you guys already know this idea,
but you should just get it done.</v>

1029
01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:46.853
I think it'd be great.
Yeah.

1030
01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:49.530
<v 0>Working on it,
man.
We really are working.
We really are.
It's really,</v>

1031
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:54.530
so the reason she asked you about 69 so,
um,

1032
01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:59.480
you want to talk about shitting and black guy's penis.
What about six to nine

1033
01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:02.330
<v 5>Nigga,
all the way over the black guy's penis possibly.</v>

1034
01:04:02.331 --> 01:04:05.660
Have you ever seen that website?
Black [inaudible] dot com no.

1035
01:04:06.110 --> 01:04:10.040
You're talking about black penises and you haven't seen black and.com it's a

1036
01:04:10.041 --> 01:04:13.280
website dedicated to black guys having sex with white girls.

1037
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:19.730
You mean black?
Oh,
black and Tom,
I'm going to correct.

1038
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.470
Okay,
so it's black.com.

1039
01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:26.150
<v 0>Yeah.
Wait,
is that part of the dog fart network?
Maybe.
What is happening?</v>

1040
01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:30.890
Maybe because this dark web is this stuff I'm,
but I've just heard stories,

1041
01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:36.100
<v 5>basically a website that's just get it dedicated to black guys having sex with</v>

1042
01:04:36.101 --> 01:04:38.500
white girls,
but they're hot white chicks and they,

1043
01:04:38.501 --> 01:04:40.960
and they have sex with the girls in the butt.

1044
01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:45.290
<v 0>Yeah.
Oh,
you guys all have tiny little dicks.
It's the funniest thing.</v>

1045
01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:47.540
It's really,
it's like a new take on it.
They're like,

1046
01:04:47.570 --> 01:04:49.940
you think black guys normally a big decks and not over here.

1047
01:04:50.330 --> 01:04:54.200
And then that's where they can fit so many in the Pauline,
how many women?

1048
01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.700
I don't want to ask the number,
but I'm,
I want to ask like I feel like how many,

1049
01:04:58.730 --> 01:05:01.400
what was it like in the,
it must've been the MTV.

1050
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:04.910
What was crazier MTV era or like,
like movies after that.

1051
01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:06.560
What was a combination?

1052
01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:10.760
But there is one lane of it crazier than the other or no,
they both.

1053
01:05:10.790 --> 01:05:14.160
<v 5>I was on the TV during the whole time I was doing the movies.
Oh,
okay.</v>

1054
01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:17.730
It was like mixed.
Yeah.
I was doing an album's

1055
01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:21.460
<v 6>HBO movies,
the whole thing.
Craziest.</v>

1056
01:05:21.461 --> 01:05:25.580
Like when you go to Daytona to do an MTV thing,
is that right about spring break?

1057
01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:29.520
Spring break.
That's got,
must have been off the chain.
It was the best.

1058
01:05:29.521 --> 01:05:33.540
You're like,
I can't come anymore.
There's no more in me.
I can't,
no.

1059
01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:36.490
I had this friend of mine,
Tony to Sant.
I'm going to see in New York.

1060
01:05:36.491 --> 01:05:41.320
You guys know Tony.
You know Tony,
right?
Right.
No,
he's not.

1061
01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:46.540
No.
He's a producer.
He's,

1062
01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:50.530
he ran,
he ran from jail.
Homeless

1063
01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:55.390
if ran MTV for a while.

1064
01:05:57.250 --> 01:06:01.370
So you know Tony.
Okay.
So Tony was,
um,
he was like a,

1065
01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:06.030
sorry,
go ahead.
He was Tony's a,

1066
01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.430
he was a producer at spring break when we were doing the chicken with the we

1067
01:06:09.431 --> 01:06:13.900
shows.
Right.
And,
um,
they used to come to my room,

1068
01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:18.160
the producers would come in my room to prep me,
you know what I mean?

1069
01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.530
To kind of like,
you know,
they just hate this.
They're going to do,

1070
01:06:20.531 --> 01:06:24.760
he was on the show,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And he came in my room and you know,

1071
01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:28.690
girls were in there already from the night before and then he come out and then

1072
01:06:28.691 --> 01:06:31.660
I'm like,
wait dude,
I got it.
I got,
and this is,
he says this,

1073
01:06:31.661 --> 01:06:36.150
so don't think I'm a pig for saying this.
I didn't say this.
He says that,
uh,

1074
01:06:36.210 --> 01:06:39.220
Polly blah blah blah.
There's a splint on my dick or something.

1075
01:06:39.221 --> 01:06:43.780
Like I had a splint on my dick.
That's what he said.
I don't remember saying that.

1076
01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:47.180
Ask Him,
but you know,

1077
01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:51.390
did you have a game set up where you'd be like,
Hey,
like go,

1078
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:55.930
I didn't have to have what
I'm saying.
Like I'm saying,

1079
01:06:55.931 --> 01:07:00.080
if you eyeballed someone,
you're working,
this is like,
hey babe,
that's it's up.

1080
01:07:00.090 --> 01:07:03.400
That's it.
Hey Babe,
what's up?

1081
01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:09.310
He just
literally rubbed my arm,
went,
hey,

1082
01:07:09.311 --> 01:07:13.980
that's how the electricity,
that's it.

1083
01:07:14.590 --> 01:07:19.510
Get into a room.
No,
it was um,
it was cool.

1084
01:07:19.511 --> 01:07:24.280
You know,
it was a spring break.
You had a,
who is that?
Lenny Kravitz was there.
Uh,

1085
01:07:24.370 --> 01:07:27.880
Rodney was down there at Kennison was down there.
Cheap trick was down there.

1086
01:07:28.090 --> 01:07:32.350
Black Crow stone,
temple pilots.
Um,
you find out,
cannibals,

1087
01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:37.450
you know,
and it was just like,
you know it with live.
Yeah.
That's what was cool.

1088
01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:42.040
And it was an event.
Spring break was the biggest event for MTV.

1089
01:07:42.041 --> 01:07:45.400
So you had hundreds of thousands of kids going in and going there just to be on

1090
01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:49.750
spring break,
you know,
it was like,
and it was live.
So it's like,
you know,

1091
01:07:49.751 --> 01:07:53.980
if you fucked up,
you fucked up,
you know,
your whole,
you know,

1092
01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:57.940
Veejay Shit.
You know,
he just,
that's how it,
what did you love the Gig?

1093
01:07:57.941 --> 01:08:02.290
It was a great case.
Yeah,
because it was like,
you felt like a Rockstar,
you know?

1094
01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:06.460
Yeah.
So it was a,
I was so lucky.
It was very fortunate,
you know.
That's very cool.

1095
01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:09.940
Um,
okay,
so the reason that she's bringing up 69,
it's an important reason.

1096
01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:14.410
So when my dad turned 70 this summer,
my mother,
who's a foreigner,

1097
01:08:14.411 --> 01:08:16.130
she's from Peru.
She

1098
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:20.970
<v 2>uh,
we asked you have white stuff over your notes.
Hey,
yeah,</v>

1099
01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:25.770
we asked her,
we said Dad's turning 70 tomorrow will you?

1100
01:08:25.771 --> 01:08:27.700
69 [inaudible] 70.

1101
01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:31.400
And it became like a joke at the dinner table because she also didn't know what

1102
01:08:31.401 --> 01:08:34.730
that meant.
Right.
So it was like a funny thing and people started doing it.

1103
01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:35.361
So anyways,

1104
01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:40.361
we told our audience about that and they have been recording their families

1105
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:45.560
asking the same question and sending in the claim.
We have some,
here we go.

1106
01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:46.700
Oh,
that's hilarious.

1107
01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:53.360
<v 7>How old did you turn today?
69 69.</v>

1108
01:08:54.850 --> 01:08:58.030
Um,
so before you turn 70,

1109
01:08:58.670 --> 01:09:02.000
like on the last night,
are you going to try to 69 one more time?

1110
01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:05.930
I don't think smarter with what my dog,

1111
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:10.170
you're going to keep them jeans high and tight,

1112
01:09:11.130 --> 01:09:15.530
<v 2>so,
right.
That's Alec and Bailey.
That's fantastic.</v>

1113
01:09:15.531 --> 01:09:19.390
She had a good attitude.
Yeah,
because some moms are,
they very man.
Shut it down.

1114
01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:24.320
<v 7>Yes.
Grandma,
grandma,</v>

1115
01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:28.280
grandma,
grandma.

1116
01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:32.770
There you going to 69 moving to celebrate
John.

1117
01:09:34.250 --> 01:09:35.240
It's a 16 on Earth.

1118
01:09:35.450 --> 01:09:40.280
<v 2>See,
somebody yelled at him,
John.
That's what that was like.
Stop.
Stop doing that.</v>

1119
01:09:40.281 --> 01:09:42.180
They were reprimanded for the fun.

1120
01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:47.810
Fun to celebrate his last night being 69.
Do you think you guys will 69

1121
01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:50.160
<v 7>you're not gay.
Be Gay.</v>

1122
01:09:58.170 --> 01:10:00.310
That where you think?
I don't think so.

1123
01:10:11.010 --> 01:10:12.910
That is fantastic Katie.

1124
01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.360
<v 2>Um,
that's a good one.</v>

1125
01:10:14.361 --> 01:10:16.780
Thank you Katie for saying that we don't usually have the women,
uh,

1126
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:19.790
record they'd been,
the guys have been sending it in,
but Katie sent it in,

1127
01:10:19.791 --> 01:10:22.340
so thank you for that.
Her Dad don't eat nothing with hair on it.

1128
01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:25.490
That was a good response actually.
It's a good mom.
They're in Alabama.

1129
01:10:27.570 --> 01:10:28.620
Uh Oh.

1130
01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:35.340
<v 7>Do you think for that 70th birthday to celebrate,
you guys are going to 69.</v>

1131
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:42.030
What do you think that man,
the fuck is wrong with you?
I love you.
Yes.

1132
01:10:42.570 --> 01:10:43.810
Those are my favorite responses.
Yeah.

1133
01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:47.180
<v 2>When they're just like,
why are you being a child?
Like why are you doing this?</v>

1134
01:10:47.181 --> 01:10:49.050
Juvenile?
It should have pushed him a note.

1135
01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.730
<v 7>I know.
Hilarious.
No,
three real,
you guys should,</v>

1136
01:10:52.731 --> 01:10:57.160
it's the last time anything.
Yeah.
Sanji

1137
01:10:59.050 --> 01:11:03.350
on Dad's 16 ninth birthday.
The last day.

1138
01:11:03.351 --> 01:11:08.350
I'm going to give the guy in the 16th year right before I turned 70 exactly.

1139
01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:11.780
What are you guys going to go out with a bang and 69 one last time.

1140
01:11:15.650 --> 01:11:20.190
<v 3>Do you do it
every night?
So embarrassed,</v>

1141
01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:21.873
but I've done it.

1142
01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:27.070
<v 6>Do it,
but I've done it.
She said,
look how excited.
Dad.
What about the guy?</v>

1143
01:11:27.071 --> 01:11:32.050
Little Tiaras guy in the corner.
He's like joining Isis.
I know.

1144
01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:36.850
It looks like my friend Romy.
Romy,
what's up?
So that's a,
that was Benji.

1145
01:11:36.851 --> 01:11:40.490
We got a couple more here.
This is a question to ask you,
Christa.
Oh,

1146
01:11:40.491 --> 01:11:44.730
you and dad are getting older.
This is fantastic.
And not this

1147
01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:45.920
<v 9>dad's about to,</v>

1148
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:49.770
he's not about to turn 70 but he's in his seventies so he's not in his 70

1149
01:11:49.771 --> 01:11:53.190
[inaudible] he's about to be in the seventies so the night before his 70th

1150
01:11:53.191 --> 01:11:57.560
birthday,
when he's 69 are you in a 6,969 what?

1151
01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:01.410
<v 3>You asked your mother that counseling but buddies,</v>

1152
01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:04.360
are you going to um,
I don't know.

1153
01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:06.460
I don't think it would just discuss this with you.

1154
01:12:08.850 --> 01:12:10.030
Fucking leaf blower.

1155
01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:14.630
<v 6>I think she's going to do it.
Oh Geez.
So horny.</v>

1156
01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:20.170
Horny.
Right.
What about me?
I'm 49.
What about me?
I'm going to be,

1157
01:12:20.190 --> 01:12:24.800
what am I going to do?
My,
yeah.
Oh yeah.
What is that?
50 of is a big one.
Yeah,

1158
01:12:24.801 --> 01:12:27.620
but what do you do 50th?
I think you have to,

1159
01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:31.910
you have to do a sexual stuff.
We do have to do sexual stuff.
What are you doing?

1160
01:12:31.911 --> 01:12:33.770
Have you been pegged?
What does that mean?

1161
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:38.020
Like a girl straps on a little low inputs in my,
but yeah,

1162
01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:40.640
but also like reaches around and cranks went out for you.

1163
01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:46.130
That's a big 50th thing.
Really?
Yeah.
Would you not let a girl do that?

1164
01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:51.440
Maybe if I was wasted.
There you go.
Yeah,
but you're going to be a fight.

1165
01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:55.790
If I put like some,
uh,
muscle relaxers in my body,
you know what I mean?

1166
01:12:55.791 --> 01:12:59.540
Listening to rectum,
you don't have to relax for something like that to go down.

1167
01:12:59.850 --> 01:13:04.070
I don't do bud sucks,
but there's a reason.
Yeah.
No,
I mean,
yeah,

1168
01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:08.410
it's a tight,
not tight.
I love how she got really,
she got,

1169
01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:12.130
she said I'm gonna send you in a counseling.
Yeah,
right.
Did you say that?
She goes

1170
01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:16.030
<v 9>because to in the seventies,
so the night before his 70th birthday,</v>

1171
01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:18.100
when he's 69 or [inaudible] 69.

1172
01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:22.570
<v 3>Why don't you ask your mother that,
that we'll send you into counseling,</v>

1173
01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:25.900
but buddies,
are you going to,
that's,
I think that's real.

1174
01:13:25.901 --> 01:13:30.040
Like they've had that conversation before.
Every time you get out of line,

1175
01:13:30.190 --> 01:13:33.270
hi Krista,
we're sending you back to counseling again,

1176
01:13:34.670 --> 01:13:36.940
but I liked that she did the poly technique,

1177
01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:41.370
<v 6>but are you going,
are you going to,
that's the whole key.
You pursue shit.</v>

1178
01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:42.350
You got a question.

1179
01:13:45.230 --> 01:13:49.410
You gotta push it?
69 69 70.
Yeah,

1180
01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:51.590
it's a good time.
It was good.
Um,

1181
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:55.950
I had the clip pool that you asked me to pull from CNN.

1182
01:13:57.210 --> 01:14:00.600
This is hilarious.
This was in regard,
I think,
was this about the fires?

1183
01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:06.370
So that was going on here.
Oh my God.
No,
it's happened in Tampa,
sorry.

1184
01:14:06.371 --> 01:14:07.350
In Tampa.
Oh,

1185
01:14:07.351 --> 01:14:11.800
about the serial killer or an arrest because they had a serial killer there.

1186
01:14:11.890 --> 01:14:12.723
Um,

1187
01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:17.890
<v 2>killed some people earlier this year.
Anyways,
there's a sign language person,</v>

1188
01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:21.460
um,
that,
you know,
they,
they do for like big press conferences.

1189
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:27.390
So this woman just came in and she's not a sign language interpreter and just

1190
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:29.743
<v 3>did it that</v>

1191
01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:34.580
sign language interpreter accused of signing total

1192
01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:40.310
jibberish
the serial killings.

1193
01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:42.140
<v 2>MMM.</v>

1194
01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:46.770
<v 6>We will be charging four counts of first degree murder is hilarious.</v>

1195
01:14:46.810 --> 01:14:51.400
<v 3>It's not to decide apparently translating every word this morning.</v>

1196
01:14:51.730 --> 01:14:51.910
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1197
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:55.900
<v 6>Isn't that hilarious?
So she did it wrong.
She was,
I wasn't doing it all.</v>

1198
01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:59.830
She's just like made it up just there having fun.
Oh,
that's hilarious.

1199
01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:03.280
5,000 tip five.

1200
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:07.290
<v 3>But it turns out
was nonsense.</v>

1201
01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:12.330
She waved her arms around like she was singing jingle bells sign language

1202
01:15:12.331 --> 01:15:13.164
experts.

1203
01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:17.340
The woman identified as Durland Roberts has a string of a rent.

1204
01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:23.660
So how did she come to be translating at last week's high profile conference?

1205
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.040
I just didn't ask enough questions.
Tampa police,

1206
01:15:26.050 --> 01:15:30.660
public information officer Steve Heggerty told me the woman's simply showed up

1207
01:15:30.810 --> 01:15:33.220
out of the blue and offered her services.
Yeah.

1208
01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:37.290
<v 6>My immediate reaction like go,
I didn't call for a sign language interpreter,</v>

1209
01:15:37.291 --> 01:15:39.720
but that's great that we have one here.
Right.
Let her in.

1210
01:15:40.170 --> 01:15:43.650
This woman appear to know what she was doing to the untrained eye and that would

1211
01:15:43.651 --> 01:15:47.370
include mine.
Um,
I didn't see any problems.
Hilarious.
Oh my God.

1212
01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:51.330
That's motivate somebody.
Is it a money?
He's been arrested.

1213
01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:56.660
She's like,
I'll fuck with the police.
Yeah,
she's got a sense of humor.
She got,

1214
01:15:56.661 --> 01:15:58.510
I'm a fuck with these motherfuckers.
Yeah,

1215
01:15:58.860 --> 01:15:59.631
<v 3>this shit works.</v>

1216
01:15:59.631 --> 01:16:03.540
The shit comes three months after it was revealed that the sign language

1217
01:16:03.541 --> 01:16:07.150
interpreter and then her current cane urban,
who is this guy,
bad guy.
It's

1218
01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:10.350
time to act is now.

1219
01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:12.040
<v 2>And he was like,
no.</v>

1220
01:16:13.470 --> 01:16:14.303
<v 3>Coming up.</v>

1221
01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:19.670
<v 6>That woman again.
Oh really?
I say this was not a quote,</v>

1222
01:16:19.890 --> 01:16:23.370
but it was an ethical violation.
Yeah,
that's the thing is they are,

1223
01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:26.070
they asked him,
I saw that in the news that day.
They're like,

1224
01:16:26.071 --> 01:16:28.050
there's nothing like there's no charge.
Yeah.

1225
01:16:28.051 --> 01:16:31.690
She just annoyed the shit out of everybody.
That's like I don't,

1226
01:16:31.770 --> 01:16:36.510
I can't hear the craziest her track her criminal record.
That's yeah,

1227
01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:38.670
she's legit and yeah,

1228
01:16:38.671 --> 01:16:41.880
she really is one that we like our house alarms going off hold on.

1229
01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:46.420
Or House alarmists yes.
She slammed the door too hard.
Oh,
who is she?
Oh Man.

1230
01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:51.330
Oh boy.
We can talk about her now when she leaned.
Now let's talk some shit.

1231
01:16:51.331 --> 01:16:53.850
Ambulance,
get those black penises up here.
Yeah,

1232
01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:58.690
<v 2>man.
Um,
so what do you think about that?
Yeah.
Black decks.</v>

1233
01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:02.740
Yeah.
I'll watch that shit.
Yeah.
That's crazy that your site,
is that your go to?

1234
01:17:02.770 --> 01:17:06.340
Yeah,
that's my go to.
Is it really?
Yeah.
Cause I'm in shock.
I can't believe it.

1235
01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:09.380
How,
what,
how,
how hard they give it to him.

1236
01:17:11.650 --> 01:17:15.710
<v 5>That?
Well,
when I was growing up,
when you still watch pornos it was like a,</v>

1237
01:17:15.711 --> 01:17:19.400
it was,
um,
it was like a taboo.
Interracial.
Yeah.

1238
01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:23.630
It was like a taboo and now it's like the opposite.
It's like a whole genre.

1239
01:17:23.631 --> 01:17:27.310
I mean,
it's like a popular one.
Yeah.
And I'm still freaking you out in a way.

1240
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:31.130
Yeah.
And the anal sex,
it's like really bizarre too,
because again,

1241
01:17:31.670 --> 01:17:35.990
when I was growing up,
it was like a taboo to have sex in the butt.

1242
01:17:35.991 --> 01:17:39.380
And now like every single porno,
it's like,
it's like a taboo doubt,

1243
01:17:39.381 --> 01:17:41.740
sex in the vagina,
you know what I mean?
Sure.

1244
01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:45.710
It's like the vagina just sitting there just like,
you know,
board.
Yeah,

1245
01:17:45.711 --> 01:17:48.920
you're right.
You know what I mean?
It was like the first shot.
Now it's weird,

1246
01:17:48.921 --> 01:17:49.940
right?
Yeah,
I think so.

1247
01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:53.990
<v 2>I Dunno.
It never got into so gnarly.
It wasn't into anal,
you know?</v>

1248
01:17:54.710 --> 01:17:59.480
Oh yeah.
It is what it is.
It was the anal,
a big part of your,
you know,

1249
01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:03.020
sexual exploits.
There's been a couple of times,

1250
01:18:03.021 --> 01:18:05.210
but you always have to ask the girl.
Yeah,
well,
yeah.

1251
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:07.100
You can't just like put it in.
No.

1252
01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:09.950
And do you always make sure you have lube on those moments or no?

1253
01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:13.820
You got to ask the girl.
Really?
Yeah.
Sometimes you can like,

1254
01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:18.580
like lick your finger and then put that in and that.
Sure.
It's Kinda like,
uh,

1255
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:26.870
that's kind of like a,
a version of loop,
you know what I mean?
If you just like,

1256
01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:29.870
Yup.
And then,

1257
01:18:30.010 --> 01:18:31.600
<v 5>well then you just put the,
you know what I mean?</v>

1258
01:18:31.630 --> 01:18:33.190
We used to live in and he put the,
put the,

1259
01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:36.760
put it right in the rectum hall and then you'd do the passing the baton.

1260
01:18:37.090 --> 01:18:41.110
Why don't you do a sex show?
That's what I'm thinking.
Yeah.
Uh,
sex podcast,

1261
01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:43.060
you have to think you have credible.
Here's what works.

1262
01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:47.150
<v 2>People talk about a topic within,
they have credibility,
you know,</v>

1263
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:50.420
everyone knows you got laid a lot.
Fucking talk about it.
Yeah.

1264
01:18:50.570 --> 01:18:54.140
You can give people tips.
Imagine you with like a kid.
Um,
he was like,

1265
01:18:54.141 --> 01:18:55.730
I'm going to college and nervous.

1266
01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:58.520
I don't know how to get laid and then fucking weasel comes in.

1267
01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:00.620
Shows them what's up.
I mean,

1268
01:19:00.621 --> 01:19:03.580
what would you tell some 19 year old kid listening right now?
He's like,
I don't,

1269
01:19:03.581 --> 01:19:05.810
I don't know how to,
how to approach girls.
What do you tell him?

1270
01:19:06.230 --> 01:19:08.780
I bet you have good advice.
I would,
um,

1271
01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:13.360
<v 5>it depends.
I think it's a case by case.</v>

1272
01:19:13.570 --> 01:19:17.260
That's depends on what the person looked like and what the vibe of the person

1273
01:19:17.261 --> 01:19:18.660
was.
Let's say they're just like

1274
01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:22.310
<v 2>a little insecure and they a are a little overweight and they're,
you know,</v>

1275
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:23.490
they just,
uh,

1276
01:19:23.490 --> 01:19:25.490
they're just don't have any experience so they don't know what to do.

1277
01:19:25.670 --> 01:19:28.430
But there's cute girls walking around campus and they're like,

1278
01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:31.980
<v 5>well I would definitely say the last thing.
Definitely try to make them laugh.</v>

1279
01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.660
There you go.
I think that's important.

1280
01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:37.780
I'm trying to get Pauli talk cause he'll laugh on black penises.
You know,

1281
01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:41.190
if you see a black peanut,
you just laugh at it.
Yeah,
that's what he was saying.

1282
01:19:41.250 --> 01:19:44.280
I was saying that,
but he said he can give advice to guys who want to get laid,

1283
01:19:44.281 --> 01:19:45.210
you know,
like great idea.

1284
01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:50.600
That'd be a great podcast teaching dudes had to get where you guys can do the

1285
01:19:50.911 --> 01:19:54.330
show.
This show that's going to be on FX because Louise is not there anymore.

1286
01:19:54.331 --> 01:19:58.560
He could take that slot.
Right.
And then I can,

1287
01:19:59.130 --> 01:20:03.810
I can do my podcasts from here.
What's your neighborhood kids coming in here?

1288
01:20:03.811 --> 01:20:06.770
I can teach him how to get laid.
That's a great idea.
Just think about it.

1289
01:20:08.770 --> 01:20:12.060
<v 6>Yeah.
I think laughing is the first and foremost,</v>

1290
01:20:12.061 --> 01:20:14.180
you know disarming the Babes.
Yeah.

1291
01:20:14.290 --> 01:20:17.100
You gotta yeah you gotta disarm debate.

1292
01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:20.610
He was just saying like if he had a night,
if there's a 19 year old kid,
how,

1293
01:20:20.611 --> 01:20:23.250
and I said well it's a case by case like what does the kid look like?

1294
01:20:23.251 --> 01:20:23.561
And he's like,

1295
01:20:23.561 --> 01:20:26.850
cause his little chubby little insecure and I'm like we'll probably make the

1296
01:20:26.851 --> 01:20:28.140
girl laugh.
Something silly.

1297
01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:34.620
Girls always say that horse shit on their profiles.
They can make me laugh.

1298
01:20:34.621 --> 01:20:37.710
That's always number one.
I don't know if that's true,

1299
01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:41.700
but they say they do want to make,
I think the laughing thing is true.

1300
01:20:41.930 --> 01:20:43.710
You got to follow up.
You've got to go for the close.

1301
01:20:43.711 --> 01:20:47.040
Maybe they can also get a penis enlargement too,
so once,

1302
01:20:47.850 --> 01:20:52.710
because once a girl has a really nice penis and then usually she goes back to
it,

1303
01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.840
you know,
it's kind of like familiar territory

1304
01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:01.360
for you were the wheeze on MTV and I was the skis on VH one for you.

1305
01:21:02.671 --> 01:21:06.900
Getting laid is pretty well before that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good game.

1306
01:21:09.190 --> 01:21:14.130
The hair,
he had the full head of hair.
I don't know.
My Mom's side,

1307
01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:17.730
my mom on the comedy store too.
I'd be like,
Yo Babe,
come on.
Get you some Nachos.

1308
01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:24.060
Hey,
I'll get you a Shirley temple.
Were you there all the time.

1309
01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:27.840
Even as like as a teen because that's when it's even cooler.

1310
01:21:27.841 --> 01:21:32.190
I think it's like friends are like,
oh,
let's go drink at so and so's house.

1311
01:21:32.191 --> 01:21:35.610
But you can like walk into the store.
No,
I used to.

1312
01:21:35.650 --> 01:21:40.160
There used to be the comedy store Westwood.
Yeah.
You never went there.

1313
01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:47.820
I remember a time when they close it and like the 84 or something

1314
01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:53.130
existing may not have been there.
I remember existing.

1315
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:58.680
Oh well yeah.
Okay.
Well then you remember it was right next to it was an arcade.

1316
01:21:59.190 --> 01:22:00.750
So we used to bring my friends there.

1317
01:22:00.751 --> 01:22:05.040
We still do whippets and watch you and watch all the M and watch my,

1318
01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:09.250
my girlfriend at grown named Leslie Zeeman from the valley.
She um,

1319
01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:12.090
went to Birmingham,
she was my prom,

1320
01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:16.880
my prom date and my girlfriend in high school.
And uh,
we still have sex

1321
01:22:18.610 --> 01:22:22.620
but sex probably she's from the valley,
you know,
they all do.

1322
01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:24.650
You Handle Valley Jewish valley babe

1323
01:22:26.810 --> 01:22:29.580
for that will be good.

1324
01:22:29.581 --> 01:22:33.310
You need to give millennials advice cause I do another podcast called that steep

1325
01:22:33.311 --> 01:22:37.140
brow and I get emails from 20 year olds like I don't know how to talk to people.

1326
01:22:37.141 --> 01:22:40.790
How do I talk to girls,
how do I make friends?
It's just,
you know,
it's different.

1327
01:22:40.810 --> 01:22:44.280
Like you give out free rent,
you know,
all of that was the thing.

1328
01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:49.110
They want to come over.
And
actually it's a great idea if you want to get laid,

1329
01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:53.580
put out a thing where people know that if they,
if they fuck you,

1330
01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:57.780
they could live in your house for free.
So it's an exchange of goods services.

1331
01:22:57.790 --> 01:23:00.270
You know it's a contract contract and in legal terms,

1332
01:23:00.630 --> 01:23:02.850
that's a really good way to get later.
If you're having trouble getting laid,

1333
01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:08.170
give away housing.
So who cooks?
Men from jail,

1334
01:23:08.171 --> 01:23:12.310
homeless or dog.
You want to come move in?

1335
01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:16.240
Frankenmuth cheer,
man.
Free Range.
At least in the case.
Fuck me.

1336
01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:20.590
Just in your home there.
Now you see me?
I come up with today and try it out.

1337
01:23:20.591 --> 01:23:24.940
Try it out,
man.
Try it out.
Try Out.
Since we don't cut,

1338
01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:29.140
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you the secret to our joy.
My occasionally I do,

1339
01:23:29.141 --> 01:23:33.700
but I know how to cook well.
Well we do.
We just,
it's you know,

1340
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:34.583
and who's got the time.

1341
01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:37.570
But here's what we decided to do that saved our relationship.
Real talk.

1342
01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:41.460
Even when we didn't have the money hire to fucking housekeeper.
I'm talking,

1343
01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:43.330
Tommy and I were broke as a joke.

1344
01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:47.080
We still had the $30 a week or whatever to someone else,

1345
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:50.890
clean up the boxers,
scrub those toilets on the weekend and she'll like that.

1346
01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:53.950
Yeah,
it just saves you the heartache.
Have you ever lived with a woman?

1347
01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:58.240
Like if you ever had a serious relationship?
Kinda Kinda,
yeah.

1348
01:23:58.630 --> 01:24:03.010
What's the longest this girl that had been with for awhile,
right.

1349
01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:07.660
This is the longest.
Probably.
How long is it?
Over five years.

1350
01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:12.640
Oh really?
That's nice.
He's like,
really?

1351
01:24:12.670 --> 01:24:14.230
Do you think it's really got,
I mean,

1352
01:24:14.231 --> 01:24:18.760
do you think you'll get married little weasels?
I don't know.

1353
01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:23.920
I'm very,
uh,
you know what I mean?
It's very hard for me.
I know.

1354
01:24:24.190 --> 01:24:29.110
Especially because you've been on your own for so long and you're,
yeah.
I like,

1355
01:24:29.111 --> 01:24:33.190
you know,
I kind of go back and forth with it,
you know what I mean?
Yeah.
So,

1356
01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:37.430
you know,
hey,
that's a real,
it sounds like it's a real deep issue.

1357
01:24:39.190 --> 01:24:42.850
Do you ever see a therapist?
We ever done that?
Yeah.

1358
01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:46.750
You ever talk about that?
Well,
I've done group therapy.

1359
01:24:46.930 --> 01:24:51.460
Oh no one bro.
Get in there.
I don't know.
A good one.

1360
01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:56.520
Really.
I'll recommend you to really did a girl or a boy.
Well,

1361
01:24:56.530 --> 01:25:00.090
you wouldn't see my therapist.
That's a conflict of interest.
But yeah,

1362
01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:03.280
you can't have your friends and family saying,
oh,
female or male.

1363
01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:06.340
Probably a female I think makes more sense for me.

1364
01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:12.100
You have a more lady issues than issues with women than men.
Let's say.

1365
01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:19.660
I'm cool with everyone.
It's just as far as like you guys lived together,

1366
01:25:19.690 --> 01:25:23.560
like you have a baby like that's full on like jumping in the water.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1367
01:25:23.561 --> 01:25:25.780
Well that's my issue.
Yeah.
Full on.

1368
01:25:25.781 --> 01:25:29.410
Jumping in the water and it's like there's something I really like about coming

1369
01:25:29.411 --> 01:25:32.830
home and knowing no one is going to be there and know what,

1370
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:37.810
what gives you the most with her?
It's not her at all.
It's me.
It's like,

1371
01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:39.460
I don't know.
It's just like,

1372
01:25:39.461 --> 01:25:43.870
because all day long I'm doing stuff just like you guys are and then you come

1373
01:25:43.871 --> 01:25:48.010
home.
Sometimes you just want to be by yourself.
Yeah.
You know,
but I guess,

1374
01:25:48.011 --> 01:25:50.410
you know,
you guys do that when you're on the road too.
Yeah,

1375
01:25:50.411 --> 01:25:54.400
we have a lot about wait times,
but do you think she might give you that space?

1376
01:25:54.401 --> 01:25:58.750
Like when you came home,
like give you an hour to yourself if you tore us.
Yeah,

1377
01:25:58.751 --> 01:26:02.380
of course.
But right now I'm staying in an apartment in silver lake,

1378
01:26:02.381 --> 01:26:06.110
so it's kind of,
it's a one bedroom apartment,
so that's not really conducive.

1379
01:26:06.130 --> 01:26:09.440
Right,
right.
Oh,
what do you mean?
It's like,
it's not like a big house.
Yeah,

1380
01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:14.300
I think it is scary to get married and it is scary to get this responsible.

1381
01:26:14.301 --> 01:26:16.760
It's the jumping in the water all the way.
Well,

1382
01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.560
cause I remember when Tom and I first got married,

1383
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:22.370
there were times when I felt like I,
I had to run,
like if we fought or something,

1384
01:26:22.371 --> 01:26:24.860
I'd be like,
I gotta go,
I gotta head for the hills.

1385
01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:28.520
And I think that's like a childhood thing that I had to resolve in therapy.

1386
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:32.570
Obviously I don't feel that way now,
Tommy.
Uh,
but it's a process,
you know,

1387
01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:36.070
I think it's a process.
It doesn't,
it's not normal if you're,

1388
01:26:36.071 --> 01:26:38.360
especially if you have someone all the time.
Well,
it's,

1389
01:26:38.361 --> 01:26:40.700
I think it's a growing process,
you know,

1390
01:26:40.701 --> 01:26:43.250
especially if you've got some stuff that needs to be resolved or whatever.

1391
01:26:44.230 --> 01:26:44.850
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1392
01:26:44.850 --> 01:26:47.830
<v 2>That's my,
she says,
yeah,
I'd love for you to go to therapy and Tom as well.</v>

1393
01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:51.200
Come on.
Let's talk about real quick before you go.
I know he's got to go to,

1394
01:26:51.201 --> 01:26:54.620
you've got to go down and go.
Yeah.
There's an email about kicking ass ripper.

1395
01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:58.660
Yeah.
Says a mommies.
I was revisiting the stripper catalog and had a thought.

1396
01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:02.510
My old roommate was lactose intolerant to such a degree that he got terrible gas

1397
01:27:02.511 --> 01:27:05.990
pains every time we drank milk.
How funny.
It's tied into the other thing.

1398
01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:08.660
The volume and consistency of these forts were similar.

1399
01:27:08.661 --> 01:27:10.280
They're not equal to the kings.

1400
01:27:10.730 --> 01:27:13.970
I believe this may be how the king is able to muster these mythical farts.
Josh,

1401
01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:17.840
you know about king ash ripper?
No.
Uh,
he's,
uh,

1402
01:27:18.290 --> 01:27:20.630
Internet sensation and he makes,

1403
01:27:20.690 --> 01:27:24.680
this is why I want to get out of the entertainment business for this type of,

1404
01:27:24.681 --> 01:27:28.530
she cause it because well,
you're like,
he's a celebrity on the thing.
Oh yeah,

1405
01:27:28.531 --> 01:27:32.540
I've been his ass.
I'm like,
yeah,
I can keep up with this stuff.
No,
I know.

1406
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:39.520
<v 7>That's,
that's just raw talent though.
You know what I mean?</v>

1407
01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:41.070
What's he doing?
He's fine.

1408
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:48.380
She loves it.
She loves it.
Just really tickles me.

1409
01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:54.300
It's absurd.
He does.
He goes to this for,
he does do a lot of

1410
01:27:56.620 --> 01:28:00.290
our social life and their prospects for getting weighed.
You know what I mean?

1411
01:28:00.990 --> 01:28:01.823
Yeah.

1412
01:28:06.730 --> 01:28:08.900
I see.
I don't think it's funny at all,

1413
01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:12.290
but I think it's funny that you guys think it's,
I know that's hilarious

1414
01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:18.050
and like bet you guys have been putting this on your show.

1415
01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:21.990
It's funny to me for he

1416
01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:27.710
for eight,
but he's like a big,

1417
01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:31.020
<v 2>he's into it.
He's really into it.
He also does a lot of glutton videos</v>

1418
01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:31.410
<v 7>were there.</v>

1419
01:28:31.410 --> 01:28:36.410
Know I'm having a big ass fucking breakfast or for bean and cheese burritos

1420
01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:40.940
lathered with two big ass

1421
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:47.530
fucking six sausage and cheese patties.

1422
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:49.510
<v 1>Aw,</v>

1423
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:54.390
<v 7>look at that.
4 billion.
That's about 5 million.</v>

1424
01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:58.240
1,000 calories each sausage patties.

1425
01:28:58.490 --> 01:29:03.360
<v 2>He gets kicked off a lot of the platforms that he's on.
All right,</v>

1426
01:29:03.361 --> 01:29:06.020
so then he'll,
he'll piss sneak around.
He'll sneak around.

1427
01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:08.400
So he'll be on live league and then you'll go back to youtube.

1428
01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:11.860
Then he's on just like a,
he bombs and he's back on line.

1429
01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:15.270
I fart in your face is one of his handles or Harry and gross.

1430
01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:17.340
But I think you should look him up.
He's really talented.

1431
01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:26.060
<v 0>That's my favorite part of the whole day.
You doing that?</v>

1432
01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:31.990
How are you can act in movies and create a persona y

1433
01:29:34.210 --> 01:29:37.160
man become a cultural phenomenon or you just heard on the Internet?

1434
01:29:37.410 --> 01:29:39.990
<v 2>Not For me.
All right.
But I mean,
I appreciate it.</v>

1435
01:29:39.991 --> 01:29:43.020
I'm happy that he's got so many views.
Yeah.
And you can donate.

1436
01:29:43.021 --> 01:29:47.430
If you want him to eat something for you on camera or Fart for you,

1437
01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:51.340
you'll take your donations.
Okay.

1438
01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:57.450
Yeah.
So look,
uh,
thank you first of all for coming over.

1439
01:29:57.451 --> 01:30:00.770
I know you've got to go to this game.
Um,
it was seriously fun to,

1440
01:30:00.771 --> 01:30:03.600
to hear the insight on a lot of this stuff,
man.
Seriously.

1441
01:30:03.770 --> 01:30:08.730
So you're likely to go the fuck away if you ever get hugely successful,

1442
01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:12.330
go away,
throw away thing.
So you gotta you gotta you know,

1443
01:30:12.331 --> 01:30:16.260
especially when your representatives and people around you and,
but I don't know.

1444
01:30:16.290 --> 01:30:19.350
I think that,
um,
you know,
we're,
we're,

1445
01:30:19.410 --> 01:30:22.950
you're lucky to catch fire on anything in this business.
You know,
you catch up,

1446
01:30:23.010 --> 01:30:27.630
catch a wave and if you get as big as I got,
you know,
like,
so like,

1447
01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:32.010
like this,
it's good to go away.
Yeah.
That's great advice.
That's great advice.

1448
01:30:32.011 --> 01:30:33.050
Yeah.
Um,

1449
01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:38.240
you can see a bunch of polys videos on funny or die.

1450
01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:42.840
He's done it.
He's done a number of them.
Um,
and you can catch him on tour.

1451
01:30:42.841 --> 01:30:45.840
Do you have any upcoming,
like when is this going to air?
It comes out tomorrow,

1452
01:30:45.841 --> 01:30:50.460
man.
Oh Shit.
Okay.
I'll be at the saint Louis funny bone this weekend.

1453
01:30:50.610 --> 01:30:52.990
Oh Great.
Yes.

Funnybone.
Yeah,

1454
01:30:53.230 --> 01:30:57.580

Is it really the first one?
Yeah.
All right.

1455
01:30:57.640 --> 01:31:01.170
It smells like it too,
which is awesome.
Yeah.
Do they still smoke in there?

1456
01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:03.950
There's some clubs with,
yes.
I think they still,

1457
01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:06.630
sometimes they have like a smoking show.
They'd be like the early show.

1458
01:31:06.631 --> 01:31:10.500
They'll smoke and then I'm bringing Josh Martin with me.
He's great.
He's good.

1459
01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:12.780
Who Do you guys,
who opens for you guys when you don't,

1460
01:31:12.781 --> 01:31:16.190
you bring someone or you go by yourself sometimes bringing that full shrine.

1461
01:31:16.890 --> 01:31:21.840
Joe Barton,
Nick,
Jeff Tate abroad.

Very funny.

I'll say hi.</v>

1466
01:31:34.601 --> 01:31:37.680
He's about to say,

I was like,

1467
01:31:37.690 --> 01:31:39.960
I got to fact check for it.
Yeah.
He's like,

1468
01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:44.100
All right girl.
That works at Oh,

She's good.
