No,

85
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.970

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.130
but I think I'm going to make a longer,
no.
Yeah.

87
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.450
Are you a calm sissy and yes.
I love to watch myself Jessel over everything.

88
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.060
I kind of feel like every guy does.
Don't,
you know,
I mean,

89
00:06:46.061 --> 00:06:49.290
it seems like it's pretty neat.
It is pretty neat.
Yeah.

90
00:06:49.291 --> 00:06:51.700
It's like this spout that just goes off

91
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.300
the first time that happened to you where you like,
whoa.
Like,

92
00:06:58.301 --> 00:07:02.950
did you know is going to happen come shots.
Yeah.
He did.

93
00:07:02.951 --> 00:07:05.770
You know that that was going to happen to you when the first time he did that?

94
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.180
I'm trying to remember.
I mean,
you know what,
I,
um,

95
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.330
I always had a real distance on me,
so I was,

96
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.170
I was fascinated,
you know,
quantity and firepower,

97
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.590
but I'm saying the first time,
do you remember the first time I just came out?

98
00:07:20.591 --> 00:07:23.560
Were you like,
well member,
Oh dude,
does that supposed to happen?
Oh yeah.

99
00:07:23.561 --> 00:07:24.820
You're like,
oh my God.
Yeah.
Yeah.

100
00:07:24.821 --> 00:07:28.390
I mean I remember if I can cite the first time like vividly,

101
00:07:28.391 --> 00:07:32.260
that was the first time,
but I remember being like,
Oh shit,
this is a mess.

102
00:07:32.261 --> 00:07:34.630
You know,
and,
and having to clean it up.

103
00:07:34.631 --> 00:07:39.130
And I remember one time I was staying at a relative's house and you know when

104
00:07:39.131 --> 00:07:39.820
you really,

105
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:44.820
you'd get so fired up when you're 1213 so like I got to jerk off.

106
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:50.970
So I went in the bathroom and I stood over the toilet and I jerked off and then

107
00:07:51.281 --> 00:07:53.470
it shot over the back of the toilet.

108
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.250
So I thought I was going to go in and then it was like,
oh shit.

109
00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:03.210
Some landed on some magazines when that like good ones like time and like better

110
00:08:04.001 --> 00:08:07.820
homes and gardens.
I was like,
Oh fuck.
Those aren't the good magazine.

111
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:11.100
What I'm saying,
I wasn't jerking off on a playboy.
It was right.
You know,

112
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:16.030
it was like a new,
like mom's magazine,
like Shaw.
I love this shit so much.

113
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:21.000
Now back then.
Did you use your imagination because you're only,
you know,

114
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:22.510
I didn't,
he says yeah,
it was just,

115
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.510
and then did you wipe off the magazines or you just left it?
No,
no,
no.

116
00:08:25.511 --> 00:08:26.344
You wipe it off,

117
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:29.740
hide all that stuff from your mom when you're that age because your mom's still

118
00:08:29.741 --> 00:08:31.570
doing your laundry.
Yeah.
You know,
I used to do,

119
00:08:31.571 --> 00:08:36.010
I used to jerk off into boxers and then I'll just throw those boxes under my
bed.

120
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.010
That's not a good strategy though.
I know they would just,

121
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.330
I just be a pile and then one day they'd just be gone.
Uh,

122
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.430
she was like,
I found your combined things that she proud.

123
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.320
Like my mom doesn't know a lot about that world know is what you did?
No,

124
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.180
I think she probably thought it was wet.
Like,
you know,

125
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.100
understood that there's wet dreams.
I don't think she thought

126
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.900
<v 4>I was in there.
Like I'm cranking this thing out every night now.</v>

127
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.340
I don't think so.
Can I tell you the grossest story ever told?
Yeah.

128
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.620
When I was in college there was a boy I knew about.
Yeah.
Who

129
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.500
you are,
not me.
I am definitely not who I listened to.
This though.

130
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:16.530
You're going to get very sick.
Everybody listening is can get very,
oh,

131
00:09:16.531 --> 00:09:21.531
right now he would the GOC every night in his same pajama bottoms.

132
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.370
So he would wear the same Pajama bottoms night after night and he would just,

133
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.840
you know,
ah yeah.
Bus Nuts in those jammies and then,

134
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.900
oh wait,
oh wait,
wait,
no,
no,
sorry.

135
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:38.370
I think he would use the same rag and then he put it and then he throw it to the

136
00:09:38.371 --> 00:09:40.020
side of the bed.
Anyway,

137
00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:43.950
he used the same thing over and over and I remember he left it there and then it

138
00:09:43.951 --> 00:09:47.530
grew mushrooms.
Yeah,

139
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.810
it was so gross because we lived in England,

140
00:09:49.811 --> 00:09:54.130
it was my year abroad and the climate in England is like,
you know,

141
00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.510
cold and clammy.

142
00:09:55.511 --> 00:09:59.590
And so it grew mushrooms because he was using like the same jizz rag every
night.

143
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.690
Everybody involved in this or something.
Yeah.

144
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.440
But he had the roommate I think discovered it and then we caught wind of it.

145
00:10:05.441 --> 00:10:08.740
We heard about this kid.
She's jizzing into the same,
right.
The same.

146
00:10:08.741 --> 00:10:12.430
I grew mushrooms.
Yeah.
Cause he left it by the side of his bed.

147
00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:13.560
I'm going to fucking throw it.

148
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:18.250
I know I told you it was the grossest story ever told.
Are you proud of me?
Yeah.

149
00:10:18.251 --> 00:10:21.700

Proud of my thought.

178
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:14.373
Lord's work.

179
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:22.420
It's Christian Christian.
They allow this on youtube.
You're allowed to talk.

180
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:23.263
So

181
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.530
<v 10>yeah,
I mean she's just talking about it.
You know,</v>

182
00:12:25.531 --> 00:12:27.600
she's not shoving anything up in her.

183
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:31.270
<v 9>Can you do that?
Can you,
um,

184
00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:36.170
<v 10>I mean,

that's a,
it's a blurred line I think.</v>

185
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.240
<v 9>Yeah,

John,
you want to find out?</v>

186
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.390
I do want to find out.
God,
Josh Oranges.
Yeah.

187
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:49.080
Should we stop down for a second now?
Now,

188
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.110
now how quickly can Joss Jizz

189
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.790
<v 10>hold on.
We're going to switch places for a second.</v>

190
00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:01.750
<v 9>Yeah.
This inquiring minds,
this is boring listener information.</v>

191
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.670
Got The whole world is on bated breath.

192
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.960
Waiting for Josh has calming the whole world wants you to come,
Bro.

193
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:14.940
Everybody's asking.
Yeah.
How long does it take to make me come by myself?
Yeah.

194
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:20.280
I mean it depends on the scenario obviously,
but uh,
you know,
I could get it.

195
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:22.950
I could get it out pretty quick.
Probably name under the gun.

196
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.930
If there's a gun to my head though,
I don't know if I could,

197
00:13:24.931 --> 00:13:28.260
it's not gun to your house.
Let's say I'm like,
Hey,
you know,

198
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.500
you haven't released in a few days for this purpose.
Like,

199
00:13:31.501 --> 00:13:34.770
if you want me to taste my own comic could have it ready by the ad spots,

200
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:41.730
you know,
for the show yet.
Would you dictate your own changes?
I'd probably,

201
00:13:41.731 --> 00:13:44.460
I think I accidentally have.
You know,
you were talking about your,

202
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.920
your velocity and how hard you've launched.
Yeah,

203
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:52.650
I've definitely like accidentally boot cocky myself in the past now.

204
00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.700
So I've definitely probably tasted Modelo.
Covered my own face.
Yeah.

205
00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:00.780
Lately I've laid on my back and just bathed in it.

206
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.010
The worst is when you get it in,

207
00:14:02.011 --> 00:14:06.950
in your glasses because of the shame of cleaning your glasses.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

208
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:12.000
And the thing where you have a girl wear glasses or maybe she does cover the

209
00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:16.770
glasses.
I do it with my own sometimes I've done it with my own glasses.
Yeah,

210
00:14:16.771 --> 00:14:20.760
it's called specs appeal.
It's fun cause then I can't see either.
So it's like,

211
00:14:20.761 --> 00:14:24.300
am I hitting the glasses?
I don't know.
I get to find out after.
Yeah.
That's cool.

212
00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.340
So did you talk guys,

213
00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.870
you can come inside ladies since we last spoke.
Not yet.

214
00:14:30.871 --> 00:14:34.410
We're still doing research out there.
We're getting to the bottom of it.
You know,

215
00:14:34.411 --> 00:14:38.190
every day's a new day and a new discovery.
So have this attitude.

216
00:14:38.191 --> 00:14:42.120
How about your DM game?
Is it,
I don't know if you saw some tweets out.

217
00:14:42.121 --> 00:14:45.660
Some emojis.
Yeah,
I went Emoji.
You took style,

218
00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:50.690
the BDE that Ryan was talking about and I applied it and I think it's working.

219
00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:53.240
I got a couple of nudies

220
00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:00.980
to your colleagues policy here.
Where are those?
Nudie?
Oh yeah,
no,
they'll,

221
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:05.000
they'll be at the weekly recap.
Oh,
okay.
Good,
good,
good.
What were they good ones?

222
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.780
Some were good.
Yeah.
You know,
they were all there.

223
00:15:09.781 --> 00:15:13.760
All at Paul.
Appreciate it.
I appreciate them.
Up and down.

224
00:15:13.761 --> 00:15:18.380
Left naked chick is every naked chick.

225
00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:22.220
Every,
let's be real here.
Well,
all I want you to do,

226
00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:26.060
you know my fingers are crossed for you to finish and a nice lady.

227
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.420
I pray every day to the Lord above that.

228
00:15:29.421 --> 00:15:34.421
Someday I can feel what it's like to just blast off inside of a woman.

229
00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.580
I spoke to a doctor about the value.
Oh yeah,
yeah.

230
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.660
There was a doctor at my show and he was like,
yeah,

231
00:15:41.661 --> 00:15:46.220
he needs to see someone like me and a therapist.
Oh,
together.
Two of them.

232
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.070
That's what he said.
Yeah.
You definitely need a therapist.

233
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.640
I think that's problem is emotional cycle.
That partially,

234
00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.370
I'm assuming I,
I'm,
I'd,

235
00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:59.220
I'd think there might be some trauma that there's something to,

236
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.380
to the audience.
I appreciate everyone's feedback on it.
Yes.

237
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:08.300
Everyone seems to have their theories.
Let me tell Ya.
He's got a lot of oh yeah.

238
00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:13.010
These people who blow loads all the time have all kinds of advice.
Uh,

239
00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:17.090
the one that they're like,
hey,
maybe you should get different glasses.

240
00:16:17.091 --> 00:16:21.710
You could get a smoke show.
And that way,
these are not for show people.

241
00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:26.420
These are,
I have to wear them.
I don't want to,
these aren't like my,

242
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:30.320
that's not going to help.
You know,
I thought maybe if I got better ones,

243
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.200
I could see the girl in more HD,
you know?

244
00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:37.040
And then maybe that would help me come because maybe it's because it's blurry.

245
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.410
I think you need help.
We got to go to the doctor.

246
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:43.550
What kind of doctor were you speaking with?
Just that there was a urologist.

247
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:48.190
The urologist need a therapist.
Oh,
that's so much doctor stuff.
It is.

248
00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:52.880
But you want to come last time you saw?
Yeah,
I know.
Boy.

249
00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.210
Cockroaches on go to the door in the year 2019 guy.
Uh,

250
00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.370
it would have been
eight years ago.

251
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:05.750
Mandated physical for a job.
Dude.

252
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.720
Can we get another physical going?
Yeah,
I'm scared to find out.

253
00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.790
What's a good idea though?

254
00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:14.840
Don't you feel like if I find out what's wrong then I,
then I'll die.

255
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.370
You know what I mean?
Like for the show though.
Okay,
that's true.
Yeah we can,

256
00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:22.060
I'll put my fuck all that Hipaa Shit.
I'll put it all out there.

257
00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:26.780
You could be having neuropathy issues and then in that case we can do math on

258
00:17:26.781 --> 00:17:29.210
the show.
Boom.

259
00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.300
I might have to have you film that elsewhere just for legal reasons.

260
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.780
An undisclosed location and then,

261
00:17:35.781 --> 00:17:39.200
but then just make sure you get a high quality video.
Of course.
Yeah,

272
00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:22.230
the periscope yesterday because he was the prince of periscope and um,

273
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:27.630
it was like a really awesome energy and celebration and remembrance of that guy.

274
00:18:31.631 --> 00:18:34.450
I mean,
the amount of people that showed up.
Oh,

275
00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:38.140
just wanted to pay respect or show love to them.

Yeah.

279
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.750
Jack Golf.
Very nice.

280
00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:57.310
<v 0>Okay.
You like the most amazing,
yes.</v>

281
00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.970
Back and forth speech like that where he was,

282
00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:05.830
it was touching and heartfelt and then hilarious.
And then,
you know,
it was going,

283
00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.510
it was back and forth and it was like,

284
00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:10.630
there was like an emotional rollercoaster just to,
to be there.

285
00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.090
<v 4>Yeah.
But I will say,
you know,</v>

286
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:17.000
Jeff Ross had some great lines which we'll get into,
but um,

287
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:19.030
but he made this great point that,
you know,

288
00:19:19.031 --> 00:19:23.910
comedy is this receptacle for broken people and um,

289
00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:25.270
I dunno,

290
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:29.950
it's nice to know that we have a community of broken toys and this show your

291
00:19:29.951 --> 00:19:33.610
mom's house too.
I feel as nick is obviously an extension of,
you know,

292
00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:38.590
the comedy club and the store and all that.
Yeah.
And that people belong,
you know,

293
00:19:38.591 --> 00:19:42.100
we all belong together and it's sad when you're missing a piece though.

294
00:19:42.101 --> 00:19:45.370
Brody was such a big piece of our,
yeah.
Our fat.

295
00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.410
<v 0>If it was very,
you know,</v>

296
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.870
comforting to see so many people care.

297
00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:54.280
<v 4>It was.
Yes.
And we drank a lot and been Burton work a lot.</v>

298
00:19:54.281 --> 00:19:58.810
Burke drank so much,
so much.
I had a tip,

299
00:19:58.811 --> 00:20:01.570
the waitress extra cause she,
Brett,
she brought so many beers.

300
00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:06.770
<v 0>Yeah,
I,
I did.
He had,
so at one point before we started,</v>

301
00:20:06.771 --> 00:20:11.390
he had six beers in front of them,
uh,
and a glass of wine and I was like,

302
00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:15.470
just [inaudible] and then,
you know,
they brought a few others,

303
00:20:15.471 --> 00:20:20.471
then we go to take a pee break and as we're coming back he's holding like he has

304
00:20:21.291 --> 00:20:24.860
his hands like this and there's this bottles sticking out and he's like ready to

305
00:20:24.861 --> 00:20:29.000
go back.
I'm like,
Jesus man.
Yeah.
And uh,
and then this morning I talked to him,

306
00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:33.890
he's like,
um,
I'm going to run 10 miles today.
Oh right,
right.
Why?

307
00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:38.870
And he goes,
just to lose weight.
I was like,
no.
It was like,
okay,
sounds good.

308
00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.850
Sounds like the formula.

309
00:20:40.851 --> 00:20:45.851
Most doctors and trainers recommend the hammer and they're like,

310
00:20:46.521 --> 00:20:48.130
drink a lot but then run 10 miles.

311
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.590
<v 4>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
But uh,</v>

312
00:20:50.591 --> 00:20:54.680
it got us to thinking about our own memorials.
Last night we came home,
I mean,

313
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.960
cause really Brody and they were showing clips of his stand up and it was so
fun.

314
00:20:58.961 --> 00:21:01.600
Everybody was dying,
laughing,
cheering.

315
00:21:01.601 --> 00:21:06.550
It was like Judd Apatow came and he even released the footage from funny people

316
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:10.750
used to always have this line when he was like,
I was in hangover,

317
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:12.850
hangover to due date.

318
00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:16.450
I was cut out of funny people cut out of funny people always said that they,

319
00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:22.050
they allowed him to whenever it showed the footage.
But um,

320
00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:25.990
but I mean it got us to thinking about arts and my worst nightmare.
First of all,

321
00:21:25.991 --> 00:21:27.610
if when I,
if not nine,

322
00:21:27.611 --> 00:21:32.320
if when I die do not fucking play my early material,
my early stand up.

323
00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:36.850
It's so embarrassing.
Like I'm in a fucking white dress.

324
00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.090
Remember that old should I used to do just just to be,

325
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.530
I mean just let me preface it by saying that back in the day,

326
00:21:41.531 --> 00:21:42.730
this is a decade ago,

327
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.880
there was no fucking me too movement and comedy is even way more sexist than it

328
00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:49.240
is today.
And so this girl,

329
00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:52.780
April Macy and I had to come up with a hook just to get fucking book cause I

330
00:21:52.781 --> 00:21:56.290
would never touch a female comedian really unless you're super,
super famous.

331
00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.880
So we came up with this thing naughty and sort of Nice and I was sorta Nice.

332
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:03.120
She's naughty and she's the devil and I'm the,

333
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:06.760
it was like the stupidest thing ever and I were wondering if we had to take,

334
00:22:06.761 --> 00:22:11.140
just to get into these d clubs to work my way up the circuit.
But man,

335
00:22:11.141 --> 00:22:13.940
do not play fucking any clips from my early stand up.

336
00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.800
I will die of embarrassment and the,
I can just see it too.
They're like,

337
00:22:17.801 --> 00:22:20.770
Christina was a great a comedian.

338
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:25.350
She did a lot of work on the Fart Mike and then like cut to me farting show.

339
00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:29.920
Yeah.
Like what?
What's my contribution?
Like not,
not as much as Brodie,

340
00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:34.900
you know,
doing,
you'd be as beloved as him.
No,
no.

341
00:22:34.901 --> 00:22:39.880
I think like maybe these guys that we employ,
like blue band,
Josh,
she's like,

342
00:22:39.881 --> 00:22:42.550
well I'm on the payroll.
I guess I have to,
cause Tom's still alive.

343
00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:46.150
Tom's got to pay us.
She's just so,
they're like,
no,
we want to be here.

344
00:22:46.151 --> 00:22:51.020
And they're like,
how fucking long is this thing?
I don't know.
I,

345
00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:55.210
I think I'd be,
I don't know.
What do you want?

346
00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.780
What's your worst nightmare is of a memorial memorial?

347
00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.180
I don't know about my worst nightmare.
I can't imagine that many people going,

348
00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:05.470
I just don't want my standup shower.
Like that would be the worst.

349
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.620
I'd want all my specials played.
You know,
everyone has to watch them all.

350
00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:17.250
You have to lie.
You have to lock every sin,
every joke,
every,
it's all,
come on.

351
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:22.840
No,
I definitely wouldn't want that.
I don't know.

352
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.550
I can't imagine that many people would go,
well,

353
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:28.030
like last night when I saw all that love for him,
I was like,

354
00:23:28.031 --> 00:23:32.990
there's no way this would have happened.
So when people love to,
yeah,

355
00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:36.550
no,
I think people would be like,
Christina never came on my podcast.

356
00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.460
I had asked her a lot of times.
She's like,
nope,
too busy.

357
00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.810
Tom Doesn't text me back.
Never.

358
00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.100
Uh,
I used to text

359
00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:50.210
<v 6>him and never texted me back.
Well,
you,</v>

360
00:23:50.211 --> 00:23:54.590
especially because you're,
you're way more antisocial.
I'm Elise nice to people.

361
00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.560
I think people will be like,
did he have a family?

362
00:23:57.561 --> 00:24:02.220
Like they wouldn't even be like a homeless guy on the street.
Yeah,

363
00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:06.050
no,
no,
I don't think it would go that well.
I don't think so either.

364
00:24:06.051 --> 00:24:10.910
For me it was amazing.
Like his was amazing.
It was really like,
uh,
uh,

365
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.680
I dunno,
a comforting experience,
uh,

366
00:24:13.681 --> 00:24:18.080
surrounding something that's obviously terrible,
but um,
it was like,

367
00:24:18.081 --> 00:24:23.081
to see so many people remember someone like that was really a wonderful,

368
00:24:24.501 --> 00:24:28.650
beautiful,
you think about what a piece of shit you are.
Just me.

369
00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:31.880
Like,
I'm so selfish.
I don't,

370
00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:36.500
I don't like make an effort to hang out with people other than my family ever.

371
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.580
Yeah.
I don't make an effort and you know,
I don't make an effort either.

372
00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:43.640
I even make an effort with,
yeah,
like don't even feel like a,
I mean we have,

373
00:24:43.641 --> 00:24:47.120
we have a seven month old and a three year old and then this and then Stan,

374
00:24:47.121 --> 00:24:50.000
I'm like,
I don't,
I don't have the effort come out in the house.
They were like,

375
00:24:50.001 --> 00:24:53.540
you know,
he just always talking about offstage,

376
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:58.250
just wanted to make you laugh,
make you laugh.

377
00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:03.350
It's such a Dick.
I know.
I don't care.

378
00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.950
I don't care either.
Did you go fucking giggle on your own?

379
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:08.240
I know and they were like,

380
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:11.450
he just wanted to spread joy and make the world and was like,

381
00:25:11.451 --> 00:25:15.490
that's definitely not my goal.
No,
I'm just like I get in,
I get out,

382
00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.170
just want to go home and sleep.
One of his friends was like,

383
00:25:18.171 --> 00:25:23.171
and then like Brody got a show and comedy central and he flew down his friend

384
00:25:23.871 --> 00:25:28.871
that he made a promise to like 20 years when we both started bawling.

385
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:31.640
I noticed both of you are like,
that's a real gentleman.

386
00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:33.350
Like the men in the audience.

387
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:36.530
You guys really respected that I can tell you of course,

388
00:25:36.531 --> 00:25:41.531
cause it's how a high character move so that the things she's talking about,

389
00:25:41.541 --> 00:25:44.540
they said that like one of his buddies that he started out with,
they were like,

390
00:25:44.541 --> 00:25:46.550
if we ever have one of us ever makes it.

391
00:25:46.551 --> 00:25:49.250
They used to do all these kite cable access shows together.

392
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.590
One was ever makes it in Hollywood.

393
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:57.350
We'll bring the other one along and like 20 years went by and then he got a

394
00:25:57.351 --> 00:26:02.351
comedy central show and on his own dime he flew that dude down from Seattle and

395
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:07.190
was like,
help me make this show.
Yeah,
of course.
You know,

396
00:26:07.191 --> 00:26:10.130
it'd be really neat when we die.
Is that the,
uh,

397
00:26:10.131 --> 00:26:15.131
the mommies that your mom's house fans will bring different shit related items?

398
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:18.860
It'll be like fake turds,
toilet paper,

399
00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:23.250
and then there'll be like an altar that would really not like fake duties or

400
00:26:23.251 --> 00:26:26.220
really wouldn't like that.
No,
I know it'd be terrible.
Yeah,

401
00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.720
because we already have all of it that we already have this.
But guys,
thanks.

402
00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:34.610
Thank you.
Please don't bring me here though.
Thank you though.

403
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:39.410
Very thoughtful.
Yeah.
I won't be remembered that kindly.

404
00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:44.010
You don't think so?
Not by strain.
Not by like that many people.
Yeah.
Like are,

405
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.900
<v 4>you know,
my family,
my children.
Hopefully you,
yeah.
Hopefully.
What,</v>

406
00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:51.170
but how long before I'm dead before you get married again?
I don't know.

407
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.470
It could be a great week.
Could be.
Yeah,
could be a long time.

408
00:26:55.471 --> 00:26:56.310
It'd be a whole month.

409
00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:57.743
<v 11>Okay.</v>

410
00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:04.570
<v 4>I could really parlay your death and this sweet person moving right along.</v>

411
00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:10.560
Are you down with this?
I mean,
I'm just saying like if I'm like,
Ooh,

412
00:27:10.561 --> 00:27:15.380
I miss her and then you know,
some chicks like to listen to you,

413
00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.610
the cackling.
It's true.
She could be like,
oh my God,

414
00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:21.860
are you so alone?
Like I am alone.

415
00:27:21.861 --> 00:27:25.430
I just want to feel the touch of another person.

416
00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:29.120
You're saying that Patton Oswald played it wrong.
Jesus Christ.

417
00:27:29.121 --> 00:27:31.910
Why didn't you take it there?
Well,
that's what that was what happened to him.

418
00:27:31.911 --> 00:27:35.540
His wife died.
And you're saying he should have played the field more,
but no,

419
00:27:35.541 --> 00:27:39.890
I didn't say that.
Picking,
I didn't find that at all.
Oh,
but well you're,
you're,

420
00:27:39.891 --> 00:27:43.940
you're jumping it.
Oh,
okay.
I just thought it was a good parallel.
No,

421
00:27:43.941 --> 00:27:47.060
it's a terrible parallel.
But you're saying you play the field more,

422
00:27:47.061 --> 00:27:49.400
you'd use sympathy to get laid.

423
00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:55.140
I'm saying Jesus,
when you saying,

424
00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.540
I'm saying you're are worded number one.
Okay.

425
00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:02.550
And I'm saying that I would get a lot of pussy.
Oh my God.

426
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:07.080
Anyways,
yesterday I was at the mall.

427
00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:11.250
I wonder where the best place would be to get it for you.
Yeah,

428
00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.730
probably the comedy club.
You think so?
Yeah.

429
00:28:14.731 --> 00:28:18.270
That's where it slots Rpa at the comedy club.
Yeah.

430
00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:22.200
We don't go out.
You don't do anything else social?
Where are you going to go?

431
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.730
Yeah,
that's a good point.
Grocery store.
Oh,
you don't even go there.
He's our mom.

432
00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:30.990
That's true.
It's the Korean.
I shift for gears.

433
00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:35.580
Okay.
Anyways,
um,
I was at the Mall,

434
00:28:35.581 --> 00:28:37.500
Aka our country club yesterday,

435
00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:41.850
and I fucking saw,

436
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:43.800
this is crazy dude.

437
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:48.300
I saw a security guard with no legs.
Yeah.

438
00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.170
Like a security or with a badge.
And then he was in a wheelchair,

439
00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:56.870
no legs.
And I'm like,
Hey man,
I'm all about equal opportunity and you know,

440
00:28:56.871 --> 00:29:01.650
and the employment.
But just from a practical perspective,
it's ridiculous.

441
00:29:01.651 --> 00:29:04.800
Like how are you going to fucking chase ridiculous a thief?

442
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:08.670
Or how are you going to stop some shit in your chair and your fucking wheelchair

443
00:29:08.671 --> 00:29:12.760
rolls.
Symbolic job.
Right.
That's totally ridiculous.
I like it.

444
00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:17.190
And it just gets my,
gets me fired up because everybody,
you know,

445
00:29:17.191 --> 00:29:21.270
we're all about fat models and everybody's equal.
And everybody,
it's like,
no,

446
00:29:21.271 --> 00:29:24.900
you're not bro.
Like there,
there are certain things,
we're not all equal.
It's,

447
00:29:24.901 --> 00:29:29.550
you can't do everything.
Yeah.
I can't,
I shouldn't be a body guard.

448
00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:34.250
Right.
Do you know what I mean?
My build my strength level.
Like what?
Yeah,

449
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.480
yeah.
I know.
It's ridiculous.
I mean,

450
00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:41.250
a guy with no legs should be able to get a job.

451
00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:42.100
Right.

452
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.790
<v 6>But like that guy,
you know,
of all the jobs that could give them at the mall,</v>

453
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:51.650
security guard would probably be dead last,
last,
last on the line and make them,

454
00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:54.170
I don't know,
administrative or something.
Right.

455
00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:57.850
Like even work at the Orange Julius

456
00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:01.780
making juices.
Yeah.
For sure.

457
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:07.070
Yogurt land or the information desk wears Orange Julius and get the jobs right

458
00:30:09.731 --> 00:30:14.390
there.
That's a great job.
Yeah.
Uh,
but yeah,
that's no good.
And I'm,

459
00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:18.700
Josh Potter said that he saw a little person security guard.
It's also,

460
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:23.400
or blue band.
No,
that's Eurydice an LP security guard.
You know,

461
00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:28.410
it's also ridiculous is that I saw a guy who was also missing some,

462
00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:33.160
my God,
this dude,
and I'm not kidding,

463
00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.200
you don't see this often,

464
00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:40.450
but he had a no hit.

465
00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.120
I walked behind him.

466
00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:49.210
I hate this so much for I hate you.
I fucking hate that you post this.

467
00:30:49.211 --> 00:30:54.160
Cause then I thought about it all day.
He has no head bay.
He has no head.

468
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:58.840
And I walked behind him.
I took photos,

469
00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:02.980
I took videos,
I posted it.
And people were like,
you're an asshole.

470
00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:08.380
I was like,
why?
And they were like,
well this guy is disabled.
Like no,

471
00:31:08.381 --> 00:31:12.490
it just doesn't have a head.
Just walks around with no head.
I mean,
look,

472
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.090
you can play this video.
Oh my God.
In the lobby there.

473
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.943
Cool.

474
00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:28.240
So terrifying.
Let's see.
Hair from behind.
That is terrible.
It's a,

475
00:31:28.241 --> 00:31:32.150
I looked it up.
His dropped head syndrome.
Fucking crime.

476
00:31:32.151 --> 00:31:36.490
The weakened muscles in his neck because he's looking down at his iPhone for too

477
00:31:36.491 --> 00:31:40.930
many.
Probably.
Yeah.
I think maybe with him at something else.
But yeah,

478
00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.990
that is the most depressing thing I've ever seen.
Yeah.

479
00:31:43.991 --> 00:31:46.700
But he never misses a quarter and never,

480
00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.030
never stumbles.

481
00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:54.340
Never trips over a crack in the sidewalk.
Nope.

482
00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:59.430
Would you say,
Ooh,
God's going to punish you?
Yeah,

483
00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:01.910
he made fun of it too far.

484
00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:08.530
You're going straight to hell.
I uh,
I sent the picture to my dad.

485
00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.690
We're going to play this and your memorial by the land

486
00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:19.090
rest and help.
My Dad just wrote no head.
Just a question mark.
Like,

487
00:32:19.091 --> 00:32:22.210
like it was a legit question.
I was like,
yeah.
And he was like,
oh,

488
00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:24.880
like that guy has no head.

489
00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:30.510
Can I tell you of all the,
I mean,
look man,
aging is whore.
Stop

490
00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:36.720
what?
You're going to hell bro.
You're fucking straight there.
Oh.

491
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:44.030
Oh God.
You got to straighten my back right now and get that started soothing.

492
00:32:44.031 --> 00:32:46.850
So straight out of that shit.
I did.
I was,

493
00:32:46.851 --> 00:32:49.430
I was even looking at my phone after this and I was like,

494
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:55.500
right,
fine.

495
00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:00.390
That's RAF Apple Saba.
I mean,
look,

496
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.500
aging is fucking brutal as it is.

497
00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:06.890
But then when you got something like this going on,
oh my life,

498
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:11.040
or you see old people with mechanical lunch in their bank that still fuck,

499
00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.840
look at that.
Life is not fair.

500
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:20.330
Life is brutal.
Hey,
this guy still has like,

501
00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:25.160
you know the character and the desire to go out,
right?

502
00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:29.280
Oh,
I would be a shut in his there.
Nothing you can do.
I would be a shut in.

503
00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:34.010
I can't prop that up.
Yeah.
And then he's put a brace on at least.

504
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:38.360
What causes that?
Just years of poor posture.

505
00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:51.590
You're the worst person in the whole world.
Why Bay?
What?

506
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:57.020
This is bad.
Oh it's so,
it's so horrible.
Horrible.

507
00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.233
Now

508
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:04.190
how unfair is life now?
I know it's terrible.
I seriously though,

509
00:34:04.191 --> 00:34:07.280
if this happened to me,
I would just be a shut in.
Like I would,

510
00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:11.900
I would just lock myself in a room and cry all day long.
Why?

511
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:16.520
I'm so shallow and weak inside.
Like I don't have this spirit to live.

512
00:34:16.521 --> 00:34:21.280
Try it for a second.
Nope.
I don't want to curse it.
Just looked at,

513
00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:25.310
oh wow.
Just look down how you get head scratch all day.

514
00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:27.770
I know I have a cavity and I start crying.

515
00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:31.070
It's great to get scratch my own head easily.
Just do this.

516
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:35.660
Other people would just think you want her because she would just walk up and

517
00:34:35.661 --> 00:34:37.790
they would see the top of your head and they'd be like,
hey,
how you doing?

518
00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.760
He'd be like,
good for the,
both of them are corrupt.

519
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:42.920
When does it affect my speech?

520
00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:49.910
When am I talking about your sisters?
Oh my God.

521
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.860
Oh my God.
How does he drink and eat?
Because you have to tilt your,

522
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:57.400
oh,
he's fine.
It's just a gag.
He was just doing this for awhile.

523
00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.420
He saw that there were kids around and he's like,

524
00:34:59.421 --> 00:35:03.560
you want to see his kids freak out and then this should be the poster for,

525
00:35:03.561 --> 00:35:05.920
don't spend so much time on your phone.
It really should.

526
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:10.280
We should show this to my children immediately.
You're cruel.

527
00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:15.260
Can we take this down?
I don't want to make fun of
your,
the cruelty champion,

528
00:35:15.261 --> 00:35:18.650
not me.
You're the one making fun of his posture.
You post this show on Instagram.

529
00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:23.710
I did it to make a point to look up and sit straight.
Alright.

530
00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:28.650
Posture is important everywhere right
now it's gone.

531
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:32.030
Anyways,
bigger talking points.

532
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:35.420
We started a house of farts we caught up on.

533
00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.100
I gotta tell you we were the biggest

534
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:42.600
<v 0>house of cards fans,
uh,
for those of you,
um,</v>

535
00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:45.360
that had been listening to the show for a few years.
So they,
you know,

536
00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:48.120
there was the big scandal,
Kevin Spacey.

537
00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:52.400
<v 4>What did he end up doing?
Did we find out?
For sure.
I put on deodorant today.
Uh,</v>

538
00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:56.940
you asked me as we left the house,
Babe.
Fuck God.
God.
Jesus.

539
00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:01.620
It was,
I have to have Allie get me some deodorant.
I can't do this all day.

540
00:36:01.621 --> 00:36:04.770
Sweating.
I mean the whole,
just the image.
What is this song?

541
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:09.630
It doesn't smell,
but it doesn't smell like I just turned and I just see,

542
00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:15.490
yeah,
I need to put something there.
Oh,
I'll stop it.

543
00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:19.290
My whole life is watching you smell your fingers.
I feel like small day.

544
00:36:19.291 --> 00:36:22.280
I want you to either twist or nuts or smell your fingertips.

545
00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:26.730
I do at one time in 15 years.
I all my fingers,
I need deodorant.

546
00:36:26.731 --> 00:36:30.630
I'm going to text alley.
Right.
Oh my God,
I can't,
I can't go without deodorant.

547
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.553
<v 0>Anyway,</v>

548
00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:36.650
Kevin Spacey was accused of harassing men on set and then he was accused of

549
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.200
sexually assaulting men,

550
00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:45.240
young men both many years ago.
And then,
yeah,

551
00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:49.510
minors and one kid at a party and another kid at a restaurant.
And I know it's,

552
00:36:49.511 --> 00:36:54.511
it's a lot of allegedly sexual misconduct.

553
00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:55.140
Okay.

554
00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:59.880
And then he was fired from house of cards and they still made the final season

555
00:36:59.881 --> 00:37:01.350
without them and I got to tell you

556
00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:06.540
<v 4>they should bring him back.
Nope.
They're like,
I don't care who he touched.</v>

557
00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:11.310
He's so good talent.
That show fucking sucks without them.
No,
I disagree.

558
00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:16.230
I,
I'm enjoying it.
I'm into it.
It took me a minute to get used to it without him.

559
00:37:16.231 --> 00:37:20.300
He's,
I'm enjoying a good guy.
He's an amazing character guy.

560
00:37:20.301 --> 00:37:25.020
Our actor.
I would,
I like Claire.
I like seeing her world,
mourn her,

561
00:37:25.021 --> 00:37:26.760
figuring out the world.
Without it.
I would allow him,

562
00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.370
<v 0>me too,
to bring this show to do a scene with him.</v>

563
00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:32.170
Like if they were like,

564
00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:35.020
you can do a scene with Kevin Spacey but he's going to fondle you,
I'd be like,

565
00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:39.550
all right.
Would you let him?
What would you let him do?
What did,

566
00:37:39.551 --> 00:37:42.100
what are the options?
I mean,

567
00:37:42.101 --> 00:37:46.410
would you let him put his mouth on you on your pener?
Sure.
Seriously.

568
00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:49.510
I told you anybody could do that.
I don't care anybody,
anybody,

569
00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:54.420
anybody final your beans.
Sure.
Poker behold,

570
00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:59.410
behold any behold the holds kind of.
Here's the thing about the B hole is like,

571
00:37:59.411 --> 00:38:03.600
I just keep thinking about that physical I got and uh,
it is fucking rough.
Yeah,

572
00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:08.140
but the doctors more vigorous with you.
There was a lot of chocolate in there.

573
00:38:08.141 --> 00:38:11.590
He had to get,
no,
he didn't was all hard.
He didn't,

574
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:16.180
he didn't know it was mushy.
I remember he was like,
you need to wipe up

575
00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:22.440
gross anyway,
but I'll tell you something.
I like it.
A spacey,
it,

576
00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:23.500
he really does.

577
00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:28.150
Or a great actor just elevates something so much that it stood out.

578
00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:32.050
I was so excited to finally,
cause we have,
I don't know,
we got distracted.

579
00:38:32.051 --> 00:38:36.310
We didn't watch,
I started watching episode of the final season

580
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.250
<v 6>and I realized like 20,
30 minutes in,
I was zoning out.</v>

581
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:43.630
I wasn't even paying attention.
You're also not bright.

582
00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:49.970
No,
no,
I understand.
It's different.
I like it though.
I do like it.
Yeah.

583
00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:51.120
I'm sticking with it.
I mean,

584
00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.100
I like to see how she navigates the world without him.

585
00:38:54.101 --> 00:38:56.800
And maybe I'll give it another shot.
But I will say that everything,

586
00:38:56.801 --> 00:38:59.500
cause there's a lot of preposterous,
ridiculous shit in that show.

587
00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:03.520
And when you have an unbelievable act or it actually grounds it,

588
00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:08.690
cause this is a silliness.
He's just mean.
I fucking,
I don't know.
Silly.

589
00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:13.630
He's a,
he should have done what he allegedly did,
allegedly.
Allegedly.

590
00:39:13.631 --> 00:39:17.540
Of course you have to say allegedly.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.

591
00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:24.230
You remember,
uh,
yesterday on the way to the memorial.
What?

592
00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:28.680
I farted in the car.
Fucking remember it.
That was terrible.

593
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.430
Your fart.
Can I tell you what was really bad about it?
Is that,

594
00:39:32.431 --> 00:39:33.960
I don't know how you managed to do it,

595
00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:38.040
but your farts smelled like the bathroom and lax,

596
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:41.640
you know when you go and everyone's taking their shifts and then the smell of

597
00:39:41.641 --> 00:39:46.140
like 10 stranger international dumps makes one horrendous smell.

598
00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:48.420
Statute.
What?
It smelled blinded from De Moines.

599
00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:52.690
Other guys from New Delhi and Hong Kong Shit together.
Yes.

600
00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:56.880
And then it smells like one horrendous smell.
Good.
It did.

601
00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:59.790
It did.
It's all like a public restroom.

602
00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:04.380
It was so the airport really rare and really special as it.
Cool.
What,

603
00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:06.480
walk me through what you ate to get that.

604
00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:11.970
Yesterday was a good day.
Um,

605
00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:17.450
I made fitness.
I had eggs in the morning.
Um,

606
00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:23.050
he's a bacon.
Okay.
You're not being,
I'm being honest coming.
You're not.
I am.

607
00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:28.970
Oh.
And then I had that seafood.
That's what it is.
What it was.
It was a mix.

608
00:40:28.971 --> 00:40:33.940
Seafood dish for lunch that had like a little piece of Salmon,
shrimp,
uh,

609
00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:37.710
Calamari,
all grilled and um,
yeah.

610
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:40.660
Far did it smell like people who were in my asshole dying.
Okay.

611
00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:46.930
Um,
let's,
uh,

612
00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:50.470
let's explore the new member.

613
00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:58.570
They guitars,
everything.
There's a guy who's actually part of the rich guy.

614
00:40:58.571 --> 00:41:02.740
Club eyes are sweating my bad.
I didn't realize how rich he was.

615
00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:03.983
Um,

616
00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:09.090
this guy is so bad ass boy.

617
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.820
You haven't seen this dude yet,
right?
No.
I don't know who the,

618
00:41:12.821 --> 00:41:16.630

His name is Michael.
Is that right?
Right,

619
00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:21.580
isn't it Michael?
Yeah.
And this dude is,
he's got to be,

620
00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:23.470
I would say in his fifties,

621
00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:28.120
and he's just posting pics of himself with money,

622
00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:32.820

I'm getting my Dick Suck.
Um,

623
00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:34.850

624
00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:39.170
<v 0>I have for you.
Broke bitches money made Michael.

Yeah,

626
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.710
Here's a picture of where he says it's a new night,

627
00:41:45.711 --> 00:41:48.840
which means a new pussy to be bought.
So he's got the ball.

628

I got new shoes.
He's rocking Jordans.

629
00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:55.910
This dude is 50.

630
00:41:55.911 --> 00:42:00.860
He probably weighs about two 90 to three 15.

631
00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:04.220
Oh,
that's flattering help.

632
00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:06.650
I'm at a girl's house and her boyfriend just came home.

633
00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.770
He's always out there doing scandalous shit,
but he's,
uh,

634
00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:14.720
he's always pretty happy,
you know.
Um,

635
00:42:14.721 --> 00:42:19.370
Do you have any of the other,

<v 0>What he's saying to other people?
Right.</v>

638
00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:28.530
So he's like International Women's Day and tribute of this day.

639
00:42:28.531 --> 00:42:31.580
I will go and support female sex workers near me.
That's pretty cool.

640
00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:36.900
Black and Latina ladies do it best.
Kay.
So you're ugly and broke.

641
00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:41.160
Tough life praying for you versions before I go to sleep.

642
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:44.940
It's always the people with no money talking shit about me.

643
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:49.890
Some of his tweets.
Yeah.
How'd you tell us how you found this guy?

644
00:42:49.891 --> 00:42:52.950
Why pull up his Twitter?
How I found them?

I happen a lot of his tweets,
you know,

646
00:42:55.441 --> 00:42:58.890
for not having like a huge social media presence.

647
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:05.040
A lot of his tweets get like a lot of retweets and likes,

648
00:43:05.041 --> 00:43:09.000
like pretty substantial.
Um,

00:43:09.001 --> 00:43:10.770
That beer belly looks really good.

650
00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:15.460
<v 6>Um,
he's got a stack of cash next to his head on his Twitter banner.
Yeah.</v>

651
00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:16.450
Which is Kinda neat.

652
00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:20.920
Big Why and crack reaction.

653
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:25.430

00:43:25.431 --> 00:43:29.690
office.

655
00:43:29.691 --> 00:43:32.060
I might say fuck it and play for both teams.

656
00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:37.130
Talking about second,
some dicks there.
Um,

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:41.780
What do we see in here?
This is,

658
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:45.440
Can you read it?
I got the cheese.

659
00:43:45.441 --> 00:43:49.840
You little broke boys could never boss up.
Um,

660
00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.490
can you make that picture bigger by any chance?

661
00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:59.140
<v 6>This guy is a baller.
I mean,

Yeah.
Yeah.
He's cool as shit.
I mean,
he's,

665
00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:16.290
his clothes fit real nice.
I like his facial hair smiling at my haters.

666
00:44:16.291 --> 00:44:19.290
That's a good attitude to have though.
And I'm not hating for the record.

667
00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:24.000
I know Haiti.
I feel like this dude is,
but see what I'm saying?

668
00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:25.410
It's ridiculous.

669
00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:30.450
He know he got his watches is that swag attracts the ladies.
That's right.

670
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:34.590
You know you to put it out there like,

672
00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:43.710
That's right.
I'm not saying that's going to attract wife material,

673
00:44:43.711 --> 00:44:47.070
but it's going to attract lady Oh oh shit.

674
00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:52.220
Picture of him in a karate outfit is Yung Mi training to beat the pussy up.

675
00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.640
Beat the pussy up.
I mean,
he definitely has a good sense of humor.

676
00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:00.300
I'll give him that.
Oh.
Oh.
Stacks stacks.

677
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:05.340
Roush got a grill.
He's holding.
Money's put money in a seatbelt in the car.

678
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:09.570
Yeah.
Shit.
But there's more,
there's more.
It gets better.

679
00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:13.650
It gets better.
Um,

He's got an eye patch here.
What happened was,

680
00:45:13.651 --> 00:45:15.090
because my eye's messed up,

681
00:45:15.091 --> 00:45:19.380
does it mean my penises Hashtag love my wife?

682
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:24.810
I don't know.
I don't understand what's happening there.
How about this one?

683
00:45:24.811 --> 00:45:27.370
This is him wearing an eyepatch stupid bitch from last night.

684
00:45:27.371 --> 00:45:29.580
Sat on my face and didn't even wash herself.

685
00:45:29.581 --> 00:45:33.240
This is the second time this has happened.
Hmm.
He's in the hospital there.

686
00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:34.180
I see that.

687
00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:38.550
I think he's saying that someone's vagina gave his iron infection.

688
00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:39.720
Is that what I'm supposed to

689
00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:41.203
<v 12>yeah,</v>

690
00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:43.910
<v 6>sure.
Short left this.</v>

691
00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:45.433
<v 12>Yeah,</v>

692
00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:51.850
<v 6>it's a bitch button.
It's amazing.
Amazing.
How about this one?</v>

693
00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:54.310
No thanks.
You can read that.

694
00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:57.880
You can't tell what my penis is getting sucked on right now and it's just a

695
00:45:57.881 --> 00:46:02.470
photo of him sitting on the edge of the bed dressed up.
It's pretty cool.

696
00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:07.420
That's him showing that ridiculous Kiosk Watch.

697
00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:11.350
Um,
stop questioning my wealth.

698
00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:15.670
His old school that is not

699
00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:22.190
getting a phone call from my bitch.
Condos are those,
is that real money Tom?
Yeah,

700
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.590
I think that's money.
Yeah.

701
00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:27.830
Although if it's the amount that he says it is,
those bands,

702
00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:31.840
those bands would be a little more full.

703
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:37.300
But whatever.
Yeah,
he's having fun.
He's rich.
It was ridiculous.

704
00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:41.140
Kinda going to go buy a sandwich and he's got a black visa card and he's just

705
00:46:41.141 --> 00:46:45.830
showing you that debit.
It's a debit card.
Is that something like,

706
00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:54.220
Oh shit.
Now.
We went from cool guys to rich guys,
Guy Club,

707
00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:57.730
and he's super okay.
Nothing like that.

708
00:46:57.731 --> 00:47:01.930
Early morning sex and he's kind of arrangement with his wife cause that was
like,

709
00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.660
I don't know,
a lady at the sink who was not this lady.

710
00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:08.380
I don't know what that was,
bro.
And he's just like,
oh,
I just fucked this chick.

711
00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:11.830
I don't know what that's about.
Check this out.
He looks good.

712
00:47:11.831 --> 00:47:15.260
They're going to go buy some pussy.
It's so,

713
00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:20.090
it's so weird.
It's like the captions all wrong.

714
00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:22.961
You know what I'm saying?

715
00:47:22.961 --> 00:47:27.520
Like the caption on that picture should be like going to mow the lawn areas.

716
00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:31.850
Going back to this,
the shack like it should not say that,
right?
Yeah.

717
00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:34.240
I'm eating more than I should today.

718
00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:39.340
Cheeseburgers all day.
This is you.

719
00:47:39.341 --> 00:47:44.341
Poor people can't do stuff like me and he's always burning money,

720
00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:47.770
burning a hundred dollar bill.

721
00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:52.560
I don't know why people do that and know silliness.
That's just this reject.
Yeah.

722
00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:56.050
Why would you do that?
Wow.
Because he has all that money,
Tom.
I know,

723
00:47:56.051 --> 00:47:57.880
but it's just so fucking upsetting.

724
00:47:58.030 --> 00:48:02.230
And now instead of a hundred dollar bill on fire,
the fuck man.
Oh,
okay.

725
00:48:02.231 --> 00:48:04.850
This is a girl's girl.
But that music is probably gonna play on this,

726
00:48:04.851 --> 00:48:08.890
so don't play that.
But yeah,
he's in the car.
Uh,

727
00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:11.380
he spent my day with her.
I don't know the guy in the back,

728
00:48:11.381 --> 00:48:14.370
she says it's a friend.
That's hilarious.
And there's a kid in the back,

729
00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:19.000
he's just driving a chick who's like having fun dancing video.

730
00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:24.550
She's gotta be 30 years younger than him.
Always cold on.

731
00:48:24.551 --> 00:48:28.690
Involve children in your nonsense.
So what does his handle,
by the way,

732
00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:33.160
the president of the Rich Guy Club?
It is Michael Daddy 51.

733
00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.650
So He's into that sugar daddy life though.

734
00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:39.580
This could be your future and time if I,
if you know,

735
00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:44.530
if I'm gone or something.
This guy,
what I'm saying,
this is the don't test me.

736
00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:44.981
Yeah,

737
00:48:44.981 --> 00:48:48.130
but I'm saying this could be like end up the kind of thing you're doing is like

738
00:48:48.131 --> 00:48:49.900
going out with a sugar daddy.
Really good.

739
00:48:49.901 --> 00:48:52.990
I like where you're going with and what do you think?
But here's the thing,

740
00:48:52.991 --> 00:48:56.320
I'm not sure I'm his type.
Well,
maybe you're not his type.

741
00:48:56.950 --> 00:49:01.030
I used to be so skinny.
He posted.
Well,
he was rocking the same style though.

742
00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:04.360
That's like 10 years ago.
I know,
but it's like the same style.
I mean,
that's,

743
00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:07.030
it's not like a new thing that he's embraced.

744
00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:11.530
The facial hair is exactly the same.
It's got the gold chain on.
Looks good.

745
00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:14.980
It was a good luck then.
It's a great look now.
That's true.
That is true.

746
00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:19.240
So you're saying that I should go for the sugar daddy route in case you Rowley.

747
00:49:19.241 --> 00:49:24.010
I'm a wrist Jordan's on my feet.
Boy.
This dude is insane.

748
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:28.670
I love it.
I don't think I'd make a good sugar baby.
Tom,
check it out.

749
00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:31.780
I can't handle this shit.
Your girl's house,
she says hi.

750
00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:38.530
All right,
so he's got the grill and let's see.
Let's do the,
uh,
this right here.

751
00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:43.060
No,
that's a nice grill.
I mean,

752
00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:48.460
think maybe a dermatologist.
Me,
I'm blotching.

753
00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:51.160
He needs to get a skin.
I could just be alcoholism

754
00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:57.220
maybe.
But look,
dude,
you're definitely killing the game.
I mean,

755
00:49:57.430 --> 00:50:01.900
he's got hose.
He's got money.
He's got Jordan's,
he's got diamonds in his mouth.

756
00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:06.940
He's killing it for sure.
When I'm in love,
I can't think straight.
Oh No,

757
00:50:06.941 --> 00:50:11.370
he's in love shit now.
Damn.
I didn't realize that.
God Damn.

758
00:50:11.850 --> 00:50:15.850
Do you think you could love him for money?
Catch you allowed to get some head.

759
00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:20.680
Wow.
You're lucky.
It's worth checking out.
If you're listening to the show,

760
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.790
give us the handle again.
Yup.
It's a,

761
00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:28.670
it's Michael Daddy 51 it's worth a follow.
It is worth a comment.

762
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:32.270
He is really enjoying life.

763
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:37.070
I think he likes it.
No,
you're not.
You're not.
I know I'm saying,

764
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:39.950
but that type of,
I wish I were his type.

765
00:50:39.951 --> 00:50:44.240
He seems like he's a really cool guy and he's a cool guy,
but I'm saying you,

766
00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:47.930
I'm saying you might need a sugar daddy at some point.

767
00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:52.130
Would you be open to that arrangement if it's the right guy

768
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:57.320
just takes you shopping and care about,
that's the thing.

769
00:50:57.321 --> 00:51:00.230
I lean on me and my handbag problem and my,

770
00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:04.280
I love expensive stuff.
Yeah.
I love that.

771
00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:05.953
Can I say that?

772
00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:11.020
It's such a crazy thing that people that they do that it was pretty crazy with

773
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:14.600
too short here.
I was still blown away that hookers don't get paid cash.

774
00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:16.840
They just get paid and stuff.
Yeah.

775
00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:22.310
I don't want to fucking handbag.
I want health insurance,
Bro.

776
00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:27.500
I want a house.
Well,
I don't give,
give me fucking stuff.

777
00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:31.520
You don't want stuff at all.
I don't want stuff bro.
Gimme like security.
Real,

778
00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:34.400
real.
Yeah.
Maybe I could find a sugar daddy that would do that.

779
00:51:35.310 --> 00:51:36.143
<v 12>Yeah.</v>

780
00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:41.560
<v 6>Would you be a sugar baby?
Would I be rich lady?
An older,</v>

781
00:51:41.561 --> 00:51:46.240
unattractive rich lady.
I kinda liked the idea.
Really.
You would do it.

782
00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:52.000
You've got to stay super fit the job.
Here's the problem with being a sugar baby.

783
00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:54.850
Your whole life revolves around pleasing your sugar daddy.

784
00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:59.080
So your days are spent working out,
keeping yourself looking nice,

785
00:51:59.230 --> 00:52:03.820
catering to hit his or her needs.
You have to think about them constantly.

786
00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:07.870
That's true.
Well that's your job,
but that's your full time Gig.
Is that person?

787
00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:12.780
I'm really not.
Nah,
you can't.
I can't do it.

788
00:52:12.781 --> 00:52:15.950
I'd rather live in the gutter to,
I don't know.
It'd be,
yeah.
First of all,

789
00:52:15.951 --> 00:52:18.830
if she's like,
Hey,
what's up with that gut and be like,
I mean,

790
00:52:20.890 --> 00:52:23.230
I fucking worked out today.
And she was like,
well maybe do it again.

791
00:52:23.231 --> 00:52:27.820
And I'll be like,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I'm not doing that shit.
Be so abusive.
Well,
me too.

792
00:52:27.821 --> 00:52:30.520
What's up with those hanging tits?
I'm like,
I have two kids.
Well,

793
00:52:30.521 --> 00:52:33.160
they would pull your tits up for you.
I don't want to do it though.

794
00:52:33.161 --> 00:52:36.730
I kind of don't want to have surgery for that.
It seems crazy,
doesn't it?

795
00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:41.430
I mean it's a put like blood sugar.
Daddy wants a bags of saline to show.

796
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:44.830
It's pretty like crazy.
That's what he liked.
I know that I have to do it.

797
00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:49.670
So one thing that we can
talk about here,

798
00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:55.270
you remember how you were licking your lips to the Laker game?

799
00:52:55.900 --> 00:53:00.340
So they're not going to be in the post season.
They're like,
oh yeah,

800
00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:03.790
what are you talking?
You're not good enough.
So,

801
00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:07.180
but this off season.
Yeah,

802
00:53:07.570 --> 00:53:12.570
they're doing some stuff to kind of keep the fans interested.

803
00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:17.800
Fans like yourself.
So they,
they put out this video,

804
00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:19.173
um,

805
00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:22.810
and you can see whether you want to go to some of their off season at charities.

806
00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:34.710
<v 11>I'm talking about,</v>

807
00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:42.840
<v 7>look at where is this.
Let's go look at that sweat.
I love it.
Is this Jamaica,</v>

808
00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:48.870
are you seeing,
I'm seeing,
I love it.
This is what I'm talking about.

809
00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:54.190
This is why I love Laker Games.
It is a Dick Dance.

810
00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:56.900
I love it.
I love it.

811
00:53:59.630 --> 00:54:00.890
I'm on board.
Let's go.

812
00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:01.843
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

813
00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:09.950
<v 0>How much is airfare?
Where is it?
These guys [inaudible] you guys listening?</v>

814
00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:15.340
They're wearing loose fitting sweat shorts and the whole thing is they just

815
00:54:15.981 --> 00:54:20.981
dance and their dick just swings around of it and you can see how enormous

816
00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:24.200
they're dicks are and they all have,
is this going to get flagged for the song?

817
00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:29.570
No,
no,
no.
We'll be all right.
Okay.
Um,
I'm out of mind.
The Dick's.

818
00:54:29.571 --> 00:54:33.680
I just want the song get in the way,
Tom.
Yeah.

819
00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:37.790
Where is the Dick swinging competition?
This is a,
at the Lakers facilities.

820
00:54:37.791 --> 00:54:41.660
At the staples center.
Yeah.
This is,
no,
this is an Elsa Gundo.
I love this.

821
00:54:41.661 --> 00:54:43.130
We're going immediately see,

822
00:54:43.131 --> 00:54:46.550
this is why I want those floor seats at the Laker Games.

823
00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:50.870
This is all we do is what happened.
You face labs is they walked by,
they run by,

824
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:55.370
but the Lakers need to start wearing looser fitting shorts and then I'm at every

825
00:54:55.371 --> 00:54:59.000
game.
They know that too.
They know that.
Of course,
they know that.

826
00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:03.980
Glad.
Do you mind if I ask you a funny question?

827
00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:12.740
I have a funny question to ask you guys.
I'm not sure that's the right word.
Yeah.

828
00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:17.760
Um,
it's pretty cool though.
The really good a question I ask.

829
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:23.150
Baba gloss of the house.
Your House.
Oh right.
Oh,
mom's house.

830
00:55:23.151 --> 00:55:24.560
We'll be right back.

831
00:55:25.130 --> 00:55:30.130
And we're back with a very highly anticipated guests that we super excited

832
00:55:30.591 --> 00:55:35.270
about.
We were teasing this earlier.
Um,
the roast master General Jeff Ross.

833
00:55:35.271 --> 00:55:37.610
Thank you so much for the bad.

834
00:55:37.650 --> 00:55:42.650
You were talking earlier about last night and a what a beautiful night it was.

835
00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:48.130
And I didn't want to spoil it because it was so amazing that,

836
00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:48.590
you know,

837
00:55:48.590 --> 00:55:53.240
people would get up there and they would tell stories about Brody and it was

838
00:55:53.241 --> 00:55:57.320
childhood friends,
childhood baseball coach,
roommate from college.
Right.

839
00:55:57.650 --> 00:55:58.970
And these guys are saying,
you know,

840
00:55:58.971 --> 00:56:02.660
nice things and telling you some kind of funny,

841
00:56:02.661 --> 00:56:06.650
the anecdotal side stuff.
But then it was beautiful.
I cried,

842
00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:09.860
I cried during Zach.
He opened the whole thing up.
Right.

843
00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:15.380
But what I'm saying is that like,
you know,
storywise they're like,
you know,
uh,

844
00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:19.220
Brody used to come over and he would have dinner with us sometimes,
you know,
and,

845
00:56:19.850 --> 00:56:24.850
and then you got up there and you opened the memorial year,

846
00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:28.870
<v 6>memorial time with,
what did you say?</v>

847
00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:34.040
<v 13>Said,
um,
after hearing all these</v>

848
00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:39.750
childhood friends speak today,
I was starting to understand why Brody

849
00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:40.633
<v 6>killed him.</v>

850
00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:45.710
I was fucking fell down.

851
00:56:50.650 --> 00:56:55.610
We were all sitting in a row together.
Bert Kreischer,
Tom Ryan,
sickler,

852
00:56:55.611 --> 00:56:56.001
Brian,

853
00:56:56.001 --> 00:57:00.770
where everybody just goes in a rupture than Manny.

854
00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:02.930
Everybody died.
I was in the back

855
00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:06.370
<v 13>waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting for his college.</v>

856
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:10.220
<v 6>Literally this guy did half an hour.
Yeah,
he was.
He went along and you know,</v>

857
00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:13.100
I mean I noticed that the main room at the comedy store,

858
00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:16.070
they only turn the lights on for the comics.

859
00:57:16.071 --> 00:57:17.880
I noticed that all the civilians there,

860
00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:22.790
they didn't put a light on comics had lights on.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

861
00:57:22.791 --> 00:57:26.330
I mean it was looking right up at it and they didn't turn it on for any

862
00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:31.130
civilians.
There is a Fart Fart,
fart money.

863
00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:34.420
Cause that's good to know.
Especially at drinking all this coffee.

864
00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:38.060
Let your new coffee machine that he's a man.
You going to Fart.

865
00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:43.310
I Dunno.
Brody would've would've really liked that.
Now hold on.
False alarm.

866
00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:48.170
Oh my God.
I'm sorry.
Back to what we were saying.
Um,

867
00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:53.090
anyways,
and then right after you said that they played the sound drop,
um,

868
00:57:53.330 --> 00:57:54.200
of Brody's saying,

869
00:57:54.201 --> 00:57:59.201
what is it like you get it or he gets [inaudible] the place.

870
00:58:00.501 --> 00:58:04.670
Yeah.
It doubled the laugh.
You gave this fun.
You gave a great speech,
man.

871
00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:05.880
Thanks a lot.
Thank you.

872
00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:10.040
You're made for that you should do more eulogies and stuff.
I really do kill it.

873
00:58:10.050 --> 00:58:10.883
Funerals

874
00:58:11.530 --> 00:58:16.060
<v 13>and I don't know why.
I remember going as a young comic to see,</v>

875
00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:20.830
I was so honored and I got invited to any young man's funeral and then later

876
00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:24.300
Milton Berle's funeral and I went up speaking it.
Yeah,
Buddy Hackett's funeral.

877
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:27.790
I realized that those,

878
00:58:27.850 --> 00:58:32.020
those moments is when you can really cut through people's agony.
Yeah,

879
00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:33.250
and you got to do it.

880
00:58:33.251 --> 00:58:36.490
We have almost have a responsibility when they ask you as a comedian,

881
00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:41.380
even if it's a tough one.
I've spoken to,
some are tougher than others obviously.

882
00:58:41.381 --> 00:58:44.950
If you're really close to the person for sure,
but yeah,
man,

883
00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:48.380
you were really close with Hackett,
right?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
We were like,

884
00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:52.060
we were like real good pals.
Did Not know this.
How did that come about,

885
00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:57.160
Buddy Hackett,
if you don't know him?
He was a Catskills in New York comedian,

886
00:58:57.161 --> 00:59:00.220
a talk down of the side of his mouth and I met him.

887
00:59:00.590 --> 00:59:05.440
He was an Herbie the love bug movie in the 50s he was in a mad,
mad,

888
00:59:05.441 --> 00:59:07.570
mad,
mad world and he had sitcoms,

889
00:59:07.571 --> 00:59:12.490
but he was a huge nightclub comic and Vegas and Atlantic City Act,

890
00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:16.780
you know,
making a couple hundred thousand a week in the 80s you know,

891
00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:20.740
fuck right.
And he would come to the Friar's Club in New York to the,

892
00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:26.090
and he befriended me after a roast.
Just thought it was funny and invited me out.

893
00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:29.420
Well,
the first time I actually met him was it in an elevator at the friars club.

894
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:33.660
I got in the elevator and I was going to play poker with Greg Fitzsimmons and

895
00:59:33.661 --> 00:59:36.440
Ilan gold and I wasn't even a member of this friar's club yet.

896
00:59:36.441 --> 00:59:40.450
It's like a show Biz Club in New York.
And he tagged,
he tagged you up right away,

897
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:43.450
didn't he?
He must have seen you and said something.
No,
he,

898
00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:48.260
he got in the elevator and I was just wearing my one good blazer.
Here we go.

899
00:59:49.290 --> 00:59:54.080
Silent.
It's quiet.
The timing of a suicide bomber

900
00:59:55.580 --> 01:00:00.560
talking about my dead friend
guys,
I can't control the biology.

901
01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:03.120
All right,
sorry.
Go ahead as full time when you're dead friend.

902
01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:08.780
It's funny that you farted because he got on the elevator buddy and he looked at

903
01:00:08.781 --> 01:00:12.150
it and I said,
Mr Hackett,
I'm such a huge fan.

904
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:14.510
My parents who were their favorite comedian,

905
01:00:14.511 --> 01:00:16.550
and I'm a comedian and it's such an honor to meet you.

906
01:00:16.551 --> 01:00:19.700
And I shook his hand and he shook my hand.
He looked me in the eyes and said,

907
01:00:19.701 --> 01:00:22.610
you know who hates far?
It's the most midgets.

908
01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:27.200
They live at ASCE height.
And the elevator door opened.

909
01:00:27.201 --> 01:00:28.610
I didn't see him again for a year.

910
01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:33.470
And then he befriended me at the Steven Seagal roast.

911
01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:36.740
I really killed.
And uh,

912
01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:42.860
it was my first roast.
My opening joke there was pretty good too.
What was it?

913
01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.450
I realized a lot of you don't know me,

914
01:00:44.451 --> 01:00:48.350
but I feel uniquely qualified to be here today because I'm also a shitty actor.

915
01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:54.220
<v 6>Was this a golf game?
Was He,
uh,
no,
not really.
It doesn't seem like he would,</v>

916
01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:58.570
he was reasonably game,
but I don't think he got it all.
And Yeah.
You know,

917
01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.990
there's a lot of stories about him not being cool.
Yeah.
A lot

918
01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:07.250
<v 13>and,
and it was a wonderful night where Milton burrow and Buddy Hackett sort of</v>

919
01:01:07.251 --> 01:01:11.240
adopted me and I improvised with them.
And uh,
during the roast,

920
01:01:11.241 --> 01:01:15.530
that was my first rows back when they really couldn't get people and,

921
01:01:16.790 --> 01:01:19.510
and then buddy said,
gave me his phone number,
what it down and said,

922
01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:22.760
next time you're in Los Angeles,
com look me up.
And I took,

923
01:01:22.761 --> 01:01:25.670
it took me a year to call him and I finally called him and I went over for

924
01:01:25.671 --> 01:01:26.504
Brunch,

925
01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:31.520
sat in his backyard and he was like a mentor but in a weird way he was like a

926
01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:35.600
big kid too.
And I was like an old man even when I was like 30.
Yeah.
Yeah.

927
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:39.830
This was a long time ago and we were like brothers sort of met in the middle

928
01:01:39.831 --> 01:01:40.910
somewhere.
It was fun.

929
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:46.100
I try out all my jokes on him and he was a great sounding board and comedy was

930
01:01:46.101 --> 01:01:49.400
like number five on the list of stuff he was an expert on.

931
01:01:49.401 --> 01:01:53.390
He knew everything about relationships and politics and religion and he

932
01:01:53.391 --> 01:01:56.510
collected guns and he,
he's just an interesting dude.

933
01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:01.380
<v 6>I like old guys too.
Yeah.
I can hang out with old people.
Yeah,
I love it.
Yeah.</v>

934
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:02.250
Yeah.
It's more fun.

935
01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:06.610
Like we were just talking about this like really old sexist guys.

936
01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:11.310
Like old white guys were saying you were hanging out with a friend of ours.
Yeah,

937
01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:15.310
the dad and he was like,
what's that thing in a skirt abroad?
Like that gun.

938
01:02:15.311 --> 01:02:18.310
Is that,
yeah,
it's just like,
it feels like you're stepping into a time machine,

939
01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:19.980
but it makes me laugh.
I

940
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.410
<v 13>don't know.
They also like,
I mean they want you,</v>

941
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:26.180
those guys always want you to joke.
Yeah,
sit down for a good term.

942
01:02:27.030 --> 01:02:28.590
They're fun,
which is fun.

943
01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:31.290
And they live like it's her last planner or they'll fuck around with the

944
01:02:31.291 --> 01:02:35.840
waitress.
Don't go with a guy and track grandfather used to,
he used to,

945
01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.740
my grandfather was so crazy.

946
01:02:37.741 --> 01:02:41.580
I used to live with my grandfather after college and he was a retired

947
01:02:41.581 --> 01:02:45.510
construction worker.
I'm wearing his ring,
so I think about him all the time.

948
01:02:45.511 --> 01:02:46.530
I tap it on metal.

949
01:02:46.531 --> 01:02:50.880
There's a bolt from a Nazi submarine that he took off in World War II when he

950
01:02:50.881 --> 01:02:54.990
was in the U s coast guard.
He made a ring out of it anyway,
he used to,
he just,

951
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:56.760
he was so fearless.

952
01:02:57.150 --> 01:03:02.150
When he got to be about in his late seventies there was this route 22 it through

953
01:03:02.341 --> 01:03:06.060
Union New Jersey near where we live this highway and you know,

954
01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:09.030
all the shops were like in the middle lane,
so he'd have to do,

955
01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:13.740
you turns to get to the other place.
He's real and this is a highway.
He would,

956
01:03:14.250 --> 01:03:15.790
he would,
he,

957
01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:20.820
if somebody was annoying in front of them or wouldn't go,
he would bump them.

958
01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:25.680
Oh my God.
He just didn't care.
He had,
they just didn't carry,

959
01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.710
it wasn't going to hurt anybody,
but he just,

960
01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:29.430
he would pump people with his fender,

961
01:03:29.431 --> 01:03:33.690
just bumping into their car in front of them just to fuck with pets.
Other level.

962
01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.740
Yeah,
he was the best.
Yeah.
It was so funny.

963
01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:44.030
He used to stare at what does a diner diner on route 22 I think it was called,

964
01:03:44.490 --> 01:03:47.010
the lead out.
I forgot.
And,
um,

965
01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:51.300
we'd sit in a diner eating our breakfast and he looked out the window and his

966
01:03:51.301 --> 01:03:52.710
bank across the highway,

967
01:03:52.711 --> 01:03:57.120
across the three lane highway and he on the Sunday he left,
he,
he'd be like,

968
01:03:57.770 --> 01:04:02.040
does this door look unlocked?
I was like,
I got over $300 in areas.

969
01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:06.600
Like it's just funny guy.
They left the door,
the Baco,

970
01:04:06.601 --> 01:04:10.600
but he's worried about his 300.
So funny.
Yeah.

971
01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:11.820
I can hang out.

972
01:04:11.821 --> 01:04:16.500
Like hanging out with my friend's dad who's in his seventies was like,
it was a,

973
01:04:16.501 --> 01:04:20.580
it was a thrill.
Like every,
every other line was a fucking,
you know,

974
01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.540
inappropriate thing to say that nobody says it anymore.
It's inappropriate.

975
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:28.380
And it's also the source of saying that,
you know,
it's an old guy.

976
01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:31.530
He's not saying it really to be malicious.
[inaudible] himself.

977
01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:34.830
I wonder if I'll still be funny when we're old.
Think about it.

978
01:04:34.890 --> 01:04:36.650
Don't you think about it?
I mean,
there,

979
01:04:36.651 --> 01:04:41.310
there must be some secret to staying relevant or at least staying funny.
Yeah.

980
01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:45.270
Because you see a lot of old people,
they,
their drugs become corny or uh,

981
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:50.340
they're so rich or six are lazy.
They don't,
they're gonna lose their edge.

982
01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:51.990
You'd have insight into this.
What's the secret?

983
01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:55.020
I think I think either have it or you don't kind of a thing.

984
01:04:56.250 --> 01:05:00.340
I feel like if you don't lose the internal struggle,
you stay funny.
Yeah.

985
01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:05.100
You get too comfortable.
You get boring at the very least.

986
01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:08.480
Or You just become,
I don't know.
Why are,

987
01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:11.700
why are police records better than stings?
Records?

988
01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:16.170
What happens when you get successful?
How do you keep it going?

989
01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:18.580
Why was Joan Rivers hilarious

990
01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:23.310
<v 0>at 18 when maybe other people make it to 80 and their drugs are like,
Huh,
yeah,</v>

991
01:05:23.330 --> 01:05:24.163
yeah,

992
01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:25.461
<v 14>she's wild shit.</v>

993
01:05:25.461 --> 01:05:30.230
And I got to see her like a couple years before she passed and man,

994
01:05:30.231 --> 01:05:35.120
she was saying shit that nobody was saying like she was brave and you're like,

995
01:05:35.121 --> 01:05:39.020
that's what it is.
That's where it should be.
You just say wild shit.

996
01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:42.110
And I think there's such a license to ill.
The older you get,
like,

997
01:05:42.111 --> 01:05:45.050
don't you feel like you give a fuck far less.
The older I'm like,

998
01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:48.560
I don't give a fuck.
I'm gonna die soon.
Like I feel like I'm 42 now and I'm like,

999
01:05:48.561 --> 01:05:52.850
I don't have that much time left.
Really.
Maybe 30 good years maybe.

1000
01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:57.110
Fuck all y'all.
I don't give a fuck.
Who's going to remember this shit?

1001
01:05:57.140 --> 01:06:00.500
Who's going to care?
Somebody will care.
Maybe

1002
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.650
<v 0>part of the reason you do the podcast,
you do the standup,</v>

1003
01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:07.160
you do the special if you want to lead some sort of legacy.

1004
01:06:08.370 --> 01:06:12.480
<v 14>No,
because I don't think people do remember like I feel like,</v>

1005
01:06:12.481 --> 01:06:16.770
I mean how many people know who Buddy Hackett is and that guy was just here.

1006
01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:20.980
<v 0>Millions.
He died.
Just three.
Yeah.</v>

1007
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:27.010
Carlin.
I mean people already are,
I feel like forgetting,
don't know.

1008
01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:31.510
I mean he still has definitely millions of fans.
Oh,
sure.
Best for sure.
Anyway,

1009
01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:34.720
I think you were,
I think we're both right in this case.
People forget quickly.

1010
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:39.420
Yeah,
they do,
but theirs.
But the people that were affected by it.
Yeah.

1011
01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:43.550
Who you know,
dude,
it's like took in what you did for sure.

1012
01:06:43.570 --> 01:06:44.860
Very remember like it.
Yeah.

1013
01:06:45.150 --> 01:06:48.430
That's one day you'll have a podcast studio named after you or there'll be a

1014
01:06:48.431 --> 01:06:52.630
statute.
It'll be your head instead of that fucking dog right there.
But dude,

1015
01:06:52.690 --> 01:06:55.720
I was going to tell you this,
I,
because I've always been a big fan of yours.

1016
01:06:55.721 --> 01:07:00.160
I remember seeing you.
Thanks.
When I was starting out doing standup.
Yeah,

1017
01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:04.900
no,
I'm at a stoplight and a white port too far too for,
you're a fan.

1018
01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:09.100
One fired for not a fan.
Yeah,
I'm working on it.
White Porsche Boxster.

1019
01:07:09.101 --> 01:07:12.010
Was that a car or you're right.
Yeah.
See,
I remember seeing you.
Wow.

1020
01:07:12.011 --> 01:07:16.990
I'm a stop light at a stoplight.
Wow.
Jeff Ross right there.
Wow.
That was pretty,

1021
01:07:17.770 --> 01:07:22.120
that was pretty early in standup and then,
and then you were very,
very nice.

1022
01:07:22.121 --> 01:07:27.121
I had a lot of anxiety on the first night of odd ball and I saw you in the

1023
01:07:28.691 --> 01:07:32.260
coffee shop and the at the hotel and you know,
I,

1024
01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:35.590
I kind of expressed it to you and then I didn't since I didn't know you really.

1025
01:07:35.591 --> 01:07:38.770
I was like,
well,
who knows if like how you're going to take it.

1026
01:07:38.771 --> 01:07:41.770
Like it could be like,
you know,
we'll stop being a bitch or something.
Right.

1027
01:07:41.830 --> 01:07:42.850
All right,
cool.
Thanks man.

1028
01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:45.460
But you were very nice about it and you actually really,

1029
01:07:46.330 --> 01:07:48.400
I was more anxious than I was letting on.

1030
01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:51.580
You really talked me down in the nicest way.

1031
01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:54.730
It was a big crowd and you had to follow a big act.

1032
01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:58.300
And I also had a bad experience at one of the empathy,
like bad meeting.

1033
01:07:58.301 --> 01:08:03.010
Like I just didn't enjoy it right now,
but that's nice.
That's,
yeah,
that's a,

1034
01:08:03.011 --> 01:08:06.070
that's an aside from the fact that like you're talking about like how do you

1035
01:08:06.071 --> 01:08:07.630
stay doing it?
Don't you feel like,

1036
01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:13.020
I always feel like you're the guy who's coming up with these most creative ways

1037
01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:18.080
to do,
like everyone does a special where it's like,
I come out and I just,

1038
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:19.730
you know,
this is my act.
And you're like,
all right.

1039
01:08:19.731 --> 01:08:24.590
That's what a standup special is.
But you've taken like a spin on it and done.

1040
01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:29.050
You know,
you did one at the border wall,
you've turned him in jail.
You know,

1041
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:31.370
you're always pushing it though.
You're always,
you know,

1042
01:08:31.371 --> 01:08:35.590
bumping Mike's is like all,
it's all different.
Yeah.
You know?
Yeah.

1043
01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.030
<v 13>I don't know where he,
one day I should do a,</v>

1044
01:08:37.110 --> 01:08:41.130
and I wanted to see how things work out,
but I mean,
what,
why,

1045
01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:43.210
why do you think I'll get a wife and a podcast?

1046
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:47.450
Why do you think you do it that way?
I mean,
was that plan to like,

1047
01:08:47.451 --> 01:08:49.480
that's gotta be different?
It can't just be a special,

1048
01:08:49.790 --> 01:08:54.130
I think it wasn't a special as it was my act that was starting to evolve where

1049
01:08:54.131 --> 01:08:55.990
like I want her to keep roasting,

1050
01:08:55.991 --> 01:09:00.991
but I didn't want to be predictable and I didn't want to repeat myself and I

1051
01:09:01.631 --> 01:09:06.010
wanted roasting to become broader cause I,
I was,

1052
01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:08.590
I was loving it.
Yeah.
And

1053
01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:14.800
it became where I just didn't want to do regular standup anymore.

1054
01:09:14.801 --> 01:09:15.634
Audiences.

1055
01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:20.110
We're getting more and more rambunctious and the Internet and social media was

1056
01:09:20.111 --> 01:09:20.944
causing

1057
01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:25.300
me to be more interactive with my audience anyway.

1058
01:09:25.330 --> 01:09:30.330
And I feel like I started bringing people up on stage and speed roasting them.

1059
01:09:30.731 --> 01:09:32.170
And that's Kinda how it started.

1060
01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:36.280
And once it became about the audience for the second half of my show,
I was like,

1061
01:09:36.281 --> 01:09:39.520
Huh,
well who's the best person or roast?

1062
01:09:39.521 --> 01:09:43.330
How about like guys in orange jumpsuits?
That might be funny.
Yeah.

1063
01:09:43.630 --> 01:09:46.720
And then you go,
or how about women in orange jumpsuits and how about,

1064
01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:48.160
how about the next one?

1065
01:09:48.161 --> 01:09:52.330
I roast cops on the job or were these ever Tufts sells like when you would pitch

1066
01:09:52.331 --> 01:09:57.280
this very difficult,
really not just to comedy central,
uh,
but to,

1067
01:09:57.310 --> 01:10:01.540
you know,
my team obviously and,
and um,

1068
01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:03.640
and you know,

1069
01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:07.850
the jails themselves and the police precincts and the,

1070
01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:11.800
the border towns like wherever I go,
it's got,
it gets easier,

1071
01:10:11.801 --> 01:10:13.150
but the ideas get harder.

1072
01:10:13.151 --> 01:10:18.151
So it's a little bit of a catch 22 where you want to keep taking big swings,

1073
01:10:20.801 --> 01:10:22.270
but it doesn't get any easier.

1074
01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:26.250
<v 0>Right.
You supposed to get easier.
I remember in the jail one,
uh,</v>

1075
01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:29.990
something about in,
in that were you,
they told you they're like,
oh,

1076
01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:34.580
we told the guys like if they were to act up for like the last six months and

1077
01:10:34.581 --> 01:10:38.820
they couldn't come to the show.
Right.
And so then everyone was on good behavior.

1078
01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:41.110
So that helped.
And then we also told,
uh,

1079
01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:43.700
we also made all the murderers sit like up front.
Yeah.

1080
01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:50.260
<v 13>Safety issue.
Yeah.
Uh,
the,
the,
the jail administrator,</v>

1081
01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:54.560
Wayne Dickey,
Brazos county jail in Texas said,
well,

1082
01:10:54.561 --> 01:10:58.100
we're ready for ya.
I said,
I'm ready to come.
Can I come soon?
And he goes,
well,

1083
01:10:58.430 --> 01:10:59.600
can we delay it a month?

1084
01:10:59.601 --> 01:11:04.340
Cause I want to use this to incentivize good behavior.
Oh,

1085
01:11:04.341 --> 01:11:06.890
that's cool.
That makes sense.
Yeah,
I guess so.
You get something out of it.

1086
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:11.750
The jail gets up mad of it.
And uh,
and then when I got there,

1087
01:11:11.751 --> 01:11:15.510
we had a safety meeting.
I said,
isn't her army having a safety meeting?
He goes,

1088
01:11:15.511 --> 01:11:19.320
no,
there's not much for you to know.
We got it all here in our hands.

1089
01:11:20.370 --> 01:11:25.160
I go,
well there's where a guy with a gun behind,
no,
no guns in a jail.
Huh?

1090
01:11:25.370 --> 01:11:27.510
So how does this work?
And you know,

1091
01:11:27.511 --> 01:11:29.880
they didn't want to tell me too much cause I didn't want me to be nervous,

1092
01:11:29.881 --> 01:11:33.120
but I said,
well basically they let on that,

1093
01:11:34.530 --> 01:11:35.400
oh here's what happened.

1094
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:40.230
And the first show I did two shows on the first show.
I said,

1095
01:11:40.231 --> 01:11:42.510
where am I murder is that kind of as a joke?

1096
01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:47.910
And three guys on the front row raised their hand and I took a step back,

1097
01:11:47.911 --> 01:11:52.890
like surprise.
And we had a,
you know,
that show went and I uh,
in between shows,

1098
01:11:52.891 --> 01:11:57.470
I said to the two,
Wayne,
I said,
why are the,
is up front?
He goes,
oh,

1099
01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:02.280
that's the safest place for them to be.
Ah.
I said,
why?
He goes,

1100
01:12:02.281 --> 01:12:06.480
well,
if anything happens,
they're the closest to the where we can get at them,

1101
01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:09.510
but they're also the closest to me.
And they go,
yes,

1102
01:12:09.511 --> 01:12:11.400
but we can get you out easier too.

1103
01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:15.870
If these are the guys that are most likely to fight,
they're the most likely to,

1104
01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:19.110
you know,
those are the ones we want in the front,
but yet in the balcony,

1105
01:12:19.111 --> 01:12:22.590
the farthest way in the corner or the guys with the swastikas on their stomachs

1106
01:12:22.591 --> 01:12:25.590
and chess,
Jesus' soul,
it was,

1107
01:12:25.710 --> 01:12:30.420
there was no real like easy breezy spot in that room.

1108
01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:32.820
Is there like a,
a kind of relief leaving though?

1109
01:12:32.821 --> 01:12:35.850
Even like you have fun doing the show or you're like kind of good to be out of

1110
01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:38.340
there when you wrap?
Yeah,
I mean I,

1111
01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:41.210
I definitely took a couple of big deep breath.
Yeah.

1112
01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:43.060
Walking in and walking out of that place.

1113
01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:46.640
<v 14>Ballsy idea,
man.
Brave.
Were you ever afraid?</v>

1114
01:12:46.641 --> 01:12:48.890
Always afraid this could go.

1115
01:12:48.891 --> 01:12:52.100
If I make a swastika joke about the guy in the back with a swastika,

1116
01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:53.510
I wasn't even sure.

1117
01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:58.540
<v 13>And you don't want to humiliate anybody so they all have to be volunteers more</v>

1118
01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:00.250
or less to come to the show.
Yeah.

1119
01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:04.030
And I did make a speech at the end saying everything I said is a joke.

1120
01:13:04.031 --> 01:13:05.050
And you know,

1121
01:13:05.051 --> 01:13:09.100
if I called some guy in nickname or a funny joke named that shouldn't stick,

1122
01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:10.271
you know,

1123
01:13:10.271 --> 01:13:15.271
like I didn't want somebody to be bullied raw in the wrong way that I was

1124
01:13:16.090 --> 01:13:19.810
roasting.
Cause roasting is,
is anti bullying.
You know,

1125
01:13:19.811 --> 01:13:23.860
that's how I started roasting lists when I was getting bullied as a kid.

1126
01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:26.940
I sort of making fun of the bully and then he left me alone.
Yeah.

1127
01:13:27.370 --> 01:13:31.000
And he was not verbal,
but he was like hitting me and pushing people around.

1128
01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:34.480
But yeah,
I felt real good leaving.

1129
01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:39.720
I mean I was there for a week and that particular instance,
um,
Eh,

1130
01:13:39.721 --> 01:13:41.140
you know,
but I also was like,

1131
01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:44.620
I felt really lucky the whole time that I did have it take it out of there

1132
01:13:44.650 --> 01:13:49.090
because you know,
he sold a few joints in high school.
I could have gotten busted.

1133
01:13:49.810 --> 01:13:53.320
I had the advantage of being white.
I had the advantage of being careful,

1134
01:13:53.410 --> 01:13:55.990
you know,
and not doing it for too long.

1135
01:13:56.650 --> 01:14:00.760
But we all do dumb shit when we're kids.
And not all of us,
but most of us.

1136
01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:03.560
<v 14>Oh I did shoplifting and chorus,</v>

1137
01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:07.260
breaking people's mailboxes and tagging things and,

1138
01:14:07.770 --> 01:14:10.740
but do you find that and then look,
cause I as a female comedian,

1139
01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:13.110
<v 13>wow.
It looks like he's hearing this for the first day.</v>

1140
01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:18.420
<v 14>Smashing mailboxes.
Yeah.
It was kind of angry as a teenager.
Um,
I find is a,
is a,</v>

1141
01:14:18.421 --> 01:14:21.190
is a lady,
I get away with a lot of shit on stage.
Yeah.

1142
01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:25.230
Nobody expects me to say anything or do anything.
So when I,

1143
01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:30.000
and I can fucking pick on people and it's what are they going to do?
Hit a woman.

1144
01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:32.940
But for you,
do you find that because you're a man,

1145
01:14:33.570 --> 01:14:37.260
do some guy could fucking come after you after a show and be like,

1146
01:14:37.261 --> 01:14:38.310
what's so funny guy?

1147
01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:42.830
<v 13>I feel like that's always happened growing up in New Jersey,</v>

1148
01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:45.330
like starting out comedy in New Jersey,
New York.

1149
01:14:45.331 --> 01:14:48.680
You didn't need to even be a Rosca.
Any comment?
Any,

1150
01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:51.350
I mean,

1151
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:56.350
I saw a guy take a swing at John Stewart once very early in our careers and I

1152
01:14:57.111 --> 01:14:58.710
saw a guy came on stage once,

1153
01:14:58.790 --> 01:15:03.080
twice in my early career and just pulled the mic out of my hand.
You know,

1154
01:15:03.210 --> 01:15:07.490
really intimidating people.
Yeah.
I mean I had that roasting instinct,

1155
01:15:07.491 --> 01:15:11.150
but none of the skill to back it up and none of the reputation,
it was just,

1156
01:15:11.151 --> 01:15:16.100
I was just some fucking jerk.
Yeah.
You know,
I was missing a lot,
you know,

1157
01:15:16.101 --> 01:15:20.660
trying and,
and then you know,
even like at the jail for instance,

1158
01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:26.120
I wasn't even always worried about insulting someone in pissing them off because

1159
01:15:26.121 --> 01:15:28.400
that would be in front of everybody.

1160
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:32.360
I was worried about the whole week I was there or when I brought people on stage

1161
01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:36.740
and get speed roasted.
Somebody who premeditated.
Just wanting to be a show off.

1162
01:15:36.890 --> 01:15:39.170
Yeah.
You're in there for life anyway.

1163
01:15:39.171 --> 01:15:43.350
How let's Shank this goofy guest.
Yeah.
I mean,

1164
01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:47.450
I'll be a legend around here.
Let me just put him in a headlock for five seconds.

1165
01:15:47.451 --> 01:15:51.260
Let me just punch him in the face and it'll be hilarious forever.
Like,

1166
01:15:51.261 --> 01:15:52.730
that's more what I'm worried about.

1167
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:57.350
I was worried about have you got me worried about it right now?
But there's a,

1168
01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:00.380
there was a real trust factor between me,
myself,

1169
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:04.880
the inmates and the,
and the jailers and it all worked out.
Okay.

1170
01:16:05.210 --> 01:16:08.150
What is your best,
cause I mean I was definitely not my lane,

1171
01:16:08.151 --> 01:16:13.070
but what is your best advice for people who are like,
oh,

1172
01:16:13.071 --> 01:16:17.570
how do I get good at roasting?
You know,
what do you tell people?
Well,

1173
01:16:17.930 --> 01:16:18.890
at the level I'm at,

1174
01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:23.920
I feel like listening is the part that I really have to concentrate on and,

1175
01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:29.090
and you can't take for granted,
you know,
what's,

1176
01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:33.170
what's coming at you and your reactions to that is really important.
Like,

1177
01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:38.840
I'll ask somebody,
uh,
you know,
I had,
I had a lady on stage this weekend,

1178
01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:43.400
um,
she hobbled up on stage to get speed roasted with her husband.

1179
01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:46.790
I think volunteers from the audience,
I don't pick them.
They pick,
they,

1180
01:16:46.890 --> 01:16:50.960
they volunteer and this lady hobbled up on stage with crutches and she had,

1181
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:52.220
you know,
half a leg missing.

1182
01:16:53.190 --> 01:16:58.190
So to me it's not me starting off with a bunch of jokes.

1183
01:16:59.390 --> 01:17:02.480
It's about going like,
so this is your husband,

1184
01:17:02.481 --> 01:17:04.070
how long have you two been married?
You know,

1185
01:17:04.071 --> 01:17:07.910
and let her kind of get into it so that my reactions are roasty.
Right.

1186
01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:12.940
Not necessarily the first drug that usually backfires when you fire first.

1187
01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:20.370
That's interesting.
But I let her sort of pun walk into it a little bit.
Yeah.

1188
01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:23.870
Yeah.
And then once I got to know her and I saw her haircut and her outfit,

1189
01:17:23.871 --> 01:17:24.501
I was like,
you know,

1190
01:17:24.501 --> 01:17:28.400
losing your half of your leg is like number five on the shit that's fucked up

1191
01:17:28.401 --> 01:17:31.880
about it.
And by then you know,
she's even over,

1192
01:17:31.881 --> 01:17:33.620
her tits are bunching up and down.

1193
01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:38.270
She's convulsing with laughter and her husband is just falling on the floor

1194
01:17:38.271 --> 01:17:41.140
because that's awesome.
They don't,
you know,

1195
01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:46.310
disabled people sadly are never normalized there,
always treated so differently.

1196
01:17:46.311 --> 01:17:49.610
So I think she was looking for some,
some heat.

1197
01:17:49.611 --> 01:17:53.900
She wanted to laugh at her predicament and she had cancer.

1198
01:17:53.901 --> 01:17:56.210
And when I finally asked her what happened,
you know,

1199
01:17:56.211 --> 01:17:58.700
she was young enough to be like a veteran of the war,

1200
01:17:58.701 --> 01:18:03.040
but you don't see many female amputees.
So I said,
you know what,

1201
01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:05.240
you want to tell us what happened or something to that effect.

1202
01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:10.280
And she said she has cancer and,
and,
and the audience kind of,

1203
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:12.080
you know,
felt for her.

1204
01:18:12.081 --> 01:18:15.920
And I hugged her and I asked her how she's feeling now.

1205
01:18:15.921 --> 01:18:18.320
She said she's feeling great.
And then this other,

1206
01:18:18.321 --> 01:18:20.660
this weird old lady standing along the line,

1207
01:18:20.661 --> 01:18:22.370
they get waiting to get speed roasted,

1208
01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:26.180
who had already made fun of for five minutes.
Just some Wacko lady.

1209
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:31.250
Like who was just like trying to feel me up and smacking me and just,

1210
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:34.150
just a nutjob from the audience.
Um,

1211
01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:38.540
we just ran down the stage and hugged her and I said,
all right,

1212
01:18:38.541 --> 01:18:41.000
well now you survive cancer,
now you have aids.

1213
01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:44.630
So you know,

1214
01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:49.130
just like letting the audience kind of come to you a little bit really helps

1215
01:18:49.131 --> 01:18:53.930
with the road.
So you use your reaction.
He really just got to hold your tongue.

1216
01:18:53.931 --> 01:18:55.070
You know,
you might have an idea,

1217
01:18:55.071 --> 01:18:58.070
but sometimes the audience will do the set up and you'd just have to do the

1218
01:18:58.071 --> 01:19:02.740
punchline.
Yeah,
that's good advice man.
He said,

1219
01:19:02.741 --> 01:19:07.430
man,
in the bumping mix she's wearing like a Hawaiian shirt.

1220
01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:09.280
Fuck.
Did he say to her,
you're like,

1221
01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:14.210
get back on the cruise or thank you for coming from the crews because they did.

1222
01:19:14.211 --> 01:19:16.970
They look like they just gotten out of like some fucking cruise ship.

1223
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.950
And I think that's it.
I can't remember exactly.

1224
01:19:18.951 --> 01:19:21.050
I think I called you and astronauts wife.

1225
01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:24.710
Then Dave said that he had to drop her off at the,
uh,

1226
01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:28.100
at the carnival cruise ship or something.
You know,

1227
01:19:28.101 --> 01:19:31.820
like once I started they will knock it down or you know.

1228
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:38.920
Oh
No.
Sound effects.

1229
01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:43.610
That's all real.
Does that register

1230
01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:48.890
and the Emmy for Best Fart?

1231
01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:53.360
One thing about,
first of all,

1232
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:57.710
if you guys haven't seen bumping Mike's Jeff Ross and David's not pumping that

1233
01:19:57.750 --> 01:20:01.850
mic,
that one,
cause it smells real too.

1234
01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:06.020
But the uh,
the,
there's very,

1235
01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:08.060
it's very rare that you know,
as

1236
01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:12.210
<v 15>a comics do you'd watch more than like how much like five minutes of specials.</v>

1237
01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:17.180
I see how it all starts.
We ripped through all of that.

1238
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:22.260
I texted you.
I was like,
man,
this is so fucking funny.
I love that.

1239
01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:24.990
We love you guys just like you're the,
you know,

1240
01:20:24.991 --> 01:20:29.970
our favorite comics and then I dunno,
watching the,
the camaraderie,

1241
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.830
all that was great.
The one thing that I was like,

1242
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:37.310
Holy Shit that I can't even wrap my head around is that you eat before shows.

1243
01:20:38.130 --> 01:20:41.140
Like this one thing I can't really,

1244
01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:45.120
because I get how funny he is a great comic,

1245
01:20:45.121 --> 01:20:47.850
but I'm sitting there like I can't believe how he's eating right now.

1246
01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:51.550
And he's like eating before shows,
eating on stage.

1247
01:20:52.650 --> 01:20:55.160
At one point I wondered Mozzarella sticks to the Dash.

1248
01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:58.210
Can you eat before right before a show and a half

1249
01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:04.560
I'll be hungry.
Feed a hearty meal.
I won't have like steak and potatoes.

1250
01:21:04.561 --> 01:21:06.990
I have to have a little something.
Oh,
that'd be a warmup for him.

1251
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.350
Potatoes.
I like to,
if I'm doing two shows are a big long thing,

1252
01:21:13.410 --> 01:21:16.920
especially with the hotel where I kind of like run around and keep up with them.

1253
01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:22.260
I need my carbs.
Like food doesn't slow me down.
It fuels me.

1254
01:21:22.290 --> 01:21:26.760
Really.
Food and coffee.
I need carbs in coffee,
carbs and caffeine.

1255
01:21:27.210 --> 01:21:31.640
Oh,
I can't drink.
I can't drink.
You can't drink?
No,

1256
01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:33.710
I can't drink before I go on an important show.

1257
01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:37.590
I did have a sip of Tequila before I went on last night at Brody's memorial.

1258
01:21:37.591 --> 01:21:40.380
But for the most part,
if it's a show where I'm,

1259
01:21:40.890 --> 01:21:43.350
I gotta be on my game and people are paying to see me,

1260
01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:47.820
it's all carbs and caffeine.
I'd rather be a little hungry than full at all.

1261
01:21:48.690 --> 01:21:52.780
And now I love a post show feast.
I love it.

1262
01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:58.890
But you know,
yeah,
I eat before and after.
Um,

1263
01:22:01.670 --> 01:22:05.640
I don't do really do drugs.
I'm not a big drinker.
I mean,
food is the thing.
No.

1264
01:22:05.641 --> 01:22:08.860
Yeah,
me too.
I just,
I mean,
I dunno.
I always feel like whenever,

1265
01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:13.710
every time I've eaten like anything of substance on stage,
I'm like,
fuck.
Like,

1266
01:22:13.711 --> 01:22:16.590
I want a burp.
I'm feel like,
I feel like you can't really,

1267
01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:21.180
you don't feel like a performer up there.
Yeah.
I'll feel soft.

1268
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:22.710
I have to ask you this.

1269
01:22:23.210 --> 01:22:27.860
All of these roasts and it's so fucking hard to run away.
Last six,

1270
01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:31.200
sorry,
one last thing about that.

1271
01:22:31.230 --> 01:22:34.120
Just as far as food and my shows go.
Yeah,

1272
01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:36.480
you guys will appreciate this work in the road.

1273
01:22:37.530 --> 01:22:41.730
I still hold the Tempe Improv record for food sales.

1274
01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:46.680
I have the fattest fans.
Really.
I do appreciate that.
Sorry you guys.

1275
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:51.200
No disrespect to Ralphie.
May he rest in peace?
Who,
uh,

1276
01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:54.420
sold the most tater tots in a weekend there?
They told me once,

1277
01:22:54.421 --> 01:22:58.650
but I sold the most food sales.
You shouldn't need to do part of that back end.

1278
01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:02.130
You're going to have to renegotiate.
Oh,
we're all good.
Don't worry.
Tempe.

1279
01:23:02.490 --> 01:23:05.740
They let me have a three hamburgers to go that night.
Oh Wow.

1280
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:10.660
<v 13>Wow.
My back end is fine.
Okay,
good deal.</v>

1281
01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:12.450
My front end.
It's getting a little fat.

1282
01:23:14.850 --> 01:23:18.510
<v 14>Um,
but anyway,
I was going to ask you about writing roast jokes.
I mean did that,</v>

1283
01:23:18.530 --> 01:23:23.150
so it's just the hardest,
especially because you're like the big dog in that,

1284
01:23:23.210 --> 01:23:26.030
you know what I mean?
You're the guy that comes up with the real zingers.

1285
01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:29.450
So how do you fucking do the thing?

1286
01:23:29.451 --> 01:23:32.570
How do you know to write the joke that no one's going to fucking do you?

1287
01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:36.530
Like how do you do it?
Yeah,
you're the big dog.
What do you mean?
Okay.
Uh,

1288
01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:41.210
Pamela Anderson's on whatever,
right.
Let your fucking big tits,
your pussy,

1289
01:23:41.211 --> 01:23:43.720
this and that.
You know what?
They're going to go after.

1290
01:23:44.010 --> 01:23:46.440
<v 13>Let them go after it.
You got to have a better joke.</v>

1291
01:23:46.441 --> 01:23:50.280
You just have to have the best joke.
Well,
everybody else has a rough draft.

1292
01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:52.140
You got to have a joke that they are not going to think

1293
01:23:52.350 --> 01:23:53.300
<v 14>so.
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah.</v>

1294
01:23:53.301 --> 01:23:55.460
So how do you get to the joke that no one's going to think of?

1295
01:23:55.461 --> 01:23:58.700
Do you write all the obvious ones first and then just throw them in the trash?

1296
01:23:58.701 --> 01:23:59.534
Yeah.
Yeah.

1297
01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:03.610
<v 13>Really.
You do that
more often than not.</v>

1298
01:24:04.030 --> 01:24:06.010
When I first here who were roasting,
they go,

1299
01:24:06.011 --> 01:24:08.470
what do you think we're going to roast?
You know what a Bruce Willis,

1300
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:12.540
I already have a great thinking punchlines.

1301
01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:17.470
And the first thing I think of usually becomes a great opening joke or closing

1302
01:24:17.650 --> 01:24:22.390
thought.
Really?
It's your first Bruce Willis Thought,
oh,
uh,

1303
01:24:22.450 --> 01:24:25.470
I was like,
oh,
that's it.
You know,
it's going to have to be something about,
um,

1304
01:24:25.690 --> 01:24:29.950
how I look like him would be uneasy one,

1305
01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:35.230
but you know,
die hard.
Um,
whatever eight,
um,
natural causes,

1306
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.860
you know,
and then,
you know,
so people will have die hard jokes.

1307
01:24:40.861 --> 01:24:44.880
So you gotta you gotta you gotta try harder and yeah.
And,

1308
01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:48.640
and I started to look at what other connections there are like,
oh,
okay.

1309
01:24:48.641 --> 01:24:51.190
We're both from New Jersey.
There's something I can work with.

1310
01:24:51.250 --> 01:24:54.160
Even your promos for that one.
We're great.
Thanks.
Yeah,
you guys do,

1311
01:24:54.161 --> 01:24:57.670
you guys did them together?
Yeah.
We're like,
you did,
you parodied,
um,

1312
01:24:57.730 --> 01:24:59.610
what's it called?
That movie the sixth sense.

1313
01:24:59.630 --> 01:25:02.770
It's sense I see dead people and it was all,

1314
01:25:02.771 --> 01:25:07.580
I see fat people and he said it to me.
I was a kid in the bed.
Yeah.

1315
01:25:07.630 --> 01:25:11.340
That's really fun.
They're really funny.
I got to repost those for,
for uh,

1316
01:25:11.790 --> 01:25:14.230
a throwback cause those were fun promos.

1317
01:25:14.231 --> 01:25:18.460
I got to work basically act with Bruce Willis for one full day.
It's awesome.

1318
01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:21.800
And by the way,
never met a greater sport.
Right.

1319
01:25:22.270 --> 01:25:26.080
He was calling me for a month and a half before the roast.

1320
01:25:26.590 --> 01:25:28.960
I stutter,
make fun of this.

1321
01:25:28.961 --> 01:25:33.250
Don't hold back because I want to have all the goodwill when I go up at the end.

1322
01:25:33.251 --> 01:25:37.720
And you know,
he loved it.
He really loved it.

1323
01:25:37.721 --> 01:25:41.110
That's cool.
That's good to hear actually.
Yeah,
he sent me a bunch of stuff.

1324
01:25:41.111 --> 01:25:44.380
Wrote me a nice letter.
A good guy.
Yeah.
That's cool.

1325
01:25:44.710 --> 01:25:49.540
Now you finally have joined the podcast.
Yeah.

1326
01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:54.580
So a tough skin,
thick skin,
skin,
thick skin with Jeff Ross.

1327
01:25:54.581 --> 01:25:56.800
I always say life is hard.
We're getting through it together.

1328
01:25:57.370 --> 01:26:02.110
It's a cathartic bonding experience.
How many are up so far?
Um,

1329
01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:05.840
we just went with probably have about 10 episodes up.

1330
01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:09.650
Sometimes I take down the old ones just because I don't know why.

1331
01:26:09.651 --> 01:26:12.860
I like having just a few up.
Oh really?
I like having the new ones,

1332
01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:17.480
the newer ones up pit people.
We'll go deep on that back catalog.
I know,

1333
01:26:17.481 --> 01:26:20.870
but for some reason I don't want him to,
I like,
I like keeping them fresh.

1334
01:26:21.290 --> 01:26:24.320
I don't know why.
I think it's still like a hobby level for me,

1335
01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:28.580
but I was out on the road one weekend when I first moved to my new house in

1336
01:26:28.581 --> 01:26:33.581
studio city in the hills up there and my cousin Ed who loves podcast and he just

1337
01:26:33.831 --> 01:26:38.831
built a little studio down under the under the house and the pool and I really,

1338
01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:42.860
really enjoying it.
It takes me back to my college radio days.
Yeah,

1339
01:26:43.190 --> 01:26:45.140
we had Larry Charles on last week.

1340
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:48.410
He directed the boar APP movies,

1341
01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:53.840
movies that it's amazing.
The dangerous world of comedy,

1342
01:26:53.841 --> 01:26:54.800
a dangerous World Academy,

1343
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:59.750
a really cool show showing people doing stand up and like Pakistan and Syria and

1344
01:26:59.751 --> 01:27:04.460
Saudi Arabia and he's just a cool guy.
So yeah,
like this and you,
you guys get it.

1345
01:27:04.461 --> 01:27:07.160
You've been doing it for a long time.
I'm really love it.

1346
01:27:07.190 --> 01:27:12.190
I always resisted because it's a discipline and you told me,

1347
01:27:12.501 --> 01:27:14.840
Tom,
you told me in the hallway the other day at the comedy store,

1348
01:27:14.841 --> 01:27:17.510
like you got to stay consistent.
You've got to keep doing it.
So I'm,

1349
01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:21.680
I have been getting better at consistently doing it because that's what the

1350
01:27:21.681 --> 01:27:25.040
listeners,
they want to rely on.
You a little Philly.
They definitely do.
Yeah.

1351
01:27:25.130 --> 01:27:28.520
You're a natural for it.
It's going to be great man.
Thanks.
Yeah,
just keep at it.

1352
01:27:28.521 --> 01:27:32.060
Keep,
keep doing it.
I really do.
The hard part is asking people to do it.

1353
01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:37.020
I woke up today with that dilemma of like for us,
what are you talking about?

1354
01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:39.740
I know,
but you know,
some people just,

1355
01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:43.370
I just know how I feel when certain people ask me to do it and I'm like,
oh,

1356
01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:44.450
how do you say no?

1357
01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.510
Then you're there reluctantly and then you wind up doing it and then you have a

1358
01:27:47.511 --> 01:27:49.610
good time and you're like,
all right,
well I'm glad I did it.

1359
01:27:49.611 --> 01:27:53.000
But you take advantage of the fact that you're Jeff fucking Ross.
I liked that.

1360
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.750
Yeah,

1361
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:56.900
I did notice that people started stopping me and asking me if they could come

1362
01:27:56.910 --> 01:28:01.700
out.
Oh,
that's a good sign.
Must Be.
And it's growing and you do it like a,

1363
01:28:01.730 --> 01:28:03.450
like a little roast at the end of the episode.

1364
01:28:03.670 --> 01:28:07.500
And we do like touchy subjects on the news,
you know,
you know,

1365
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:11.030
whenever somebody dies,
it's a very cathartic,
when someone dies,

1366
01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:13.760
we do roast in peace.
You know,

1367
01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:19.340
we torque class week.
Who from the monkeys then you do one of a,
a Brodie.

1368
01:28:19.370 --> 01:28:24.020
We did a Brody one give us a Brody.
I said a poor Brody.
He's,

1369
01:28:24.021 --> 01:28:26.630
I'm seeing in that big side stage and the sky now

1370
01:28:29.210 --> 01:28:34.210
it says something about his great friendship with Zach Galifianakis.

1371
01:28:34.281 --> 01:28:36.110
If they ever hugged,
there'd be like velcro.

1372
01:28:36.111 --> 01:28:38.930
They would never be able to separate then.
They're both.
So Harry,

1373
01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:43.430
his hairline is named after his high school received a

1374
01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:47.990
funny,
we did the Brodie thing yesterday and now here I am.

1375
01:28:47.991 --> 01:28:52.310
I think that this might be my first time in receipt.
Yeah.
So there you go.

1376
01:28:52.430 --> 01:28:56.840
There you go.
Brody made it happen.
He really did.
I'm sensing as positive energy.

1377
01:28:57.260 --> 01:28:59.940
Um,
course I wanted to show you.
Um,

1378
01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:02.490
any other advice for the podcast?

1379
01:29:02.490 --> 01:29:07.260
<v 15>This is helpful.
No,
I gotcha.
I think assistance.
I think the consistency.</v>

1380
01:29:07.290 --> 01:29:11.400
I think how you've been doing this 10 years.
Beautiful.
I think you put in,

1381
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:14.280
you definitely will like you,
first of all,

1382
01:29:14.281 --> 01:29:19.281
you created like a little bit of a specific thing going on,

1383
01:29:19.351 --> 01:29:23.250
which is good.
Yeah.
You know,
there's so many.
So the fact that it's like,

1384
01:29:23.251 --> 01:29:25.950
I think that you're the roast guy,
people know that.
Yeah.

1385
01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:29.280
And you at least give an element of that.
Right.
But not entirely.
Right.

1386
01:29:29.281 --> 01:29:30.150
It's not the whole thing.

1387
01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:33.570
It's more about taking the jokes then dishing them out the podcast,

1388
01:29:33.571 --> 01:29:38.550
like thick skin,
like you know,
a little bit of like I always say life is hard.

1389
01:29:38.551 --> 01:29:40.170
We're getting through it together.
Yeah.

1390
01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:44.160
Well here's the thing too about like feeling weird about asking people if,

1391
01:29:44.190 --> 01:29:47.400
because it like it matters that you're doing it,

1392
01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:52.580
then use whatever juice you have to get any and all guests because it's a guest

1393
01:29:54.931 --> 01:29:59.660
reliant medium.
So you know,
don't ever feel weird about asking anybody.

1394
01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:02.940
Not that you should,
but I mean the fact that you mentioned that like,
you know,

1395
01:30:02.970 --> 01:30:06.210
you deserve to have those guests.
Yeah.
It's going to be a better product.

1396
01:30:06.211 --> 01:30:10.500
So ask everyone,
man.
Thanks.
Yeah.
What about not having guests sometimes like,
oh,

1397
01:30:10.510 --> 01:30:12.610
it's great sometimes.
Right?

1398
01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:16.630
I like it sometimes if it's just me and my cousin talking to that.

1399
01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:18.590
And you sprinkle those in.
Yeah,

1400
01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:23.600
like I sometimes I forget that it's on the draw to this show you got,

1401
01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:27.420
it's like when David Letterman would come out or Jimmy,
you know,

1402
01:30:27.421 --> 01:30:29.820
Jimmy Kimmel or Jimmy Fallon walk out on stage,

1403
01:30:29.821 --> 01:30:34.260
they don't bring Julia Roberts out.
Right.
They do 10 15 minutes of comedy.

1404
01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:37.680
People tune in for,
yes.
Yeah.
No,
we do.
We do.

1405
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:42.110
The front part of our show is just us.
All the grants and stuff.

1406
01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:44.650
I think it's important to do that and just and the,

1407
01:30:44.670 --> 01:30:48.720
and like 10 and do the episodes.
I joke,
I meant what's good.

1408
01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:53.940
Oh yeah.
I hope I'm,
I hope I'm at least as a better guest than Danny Brown.

1409
01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:55.143
<v 16>What?</v>

1410
01:30:59.230 --> 01:31:02.820
<v 15>Danny was amazing.
I know he's your best guest ever.
So I thought it makes sense.</v>

1411
01:31:03.330 --> 01:31:04.960
That's good.
That's funny.
He was,
yes.

1412
01:31:05.050 --> 01:31:06.010
<v 14>Yeah,
he uh,</v>

1413
01:31:06.030 --> 01:31:10.990
he came in here with like all the references were like,
what the,
he's like,

1414
01:31:10.991 --> 01:31:14.290
I listen to this shit all the time.
Like I was like,
oh my God.
I know.

1415
01:31:14.291 --> 01:31:17.070
That's so bizarre.
Cause like rappers listened to podcasts.

1416
01:31:17.071 --> 01:31:20.830
So we've had this thing of rappers coming on our show.
There's the crossover now.

1417
01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:21.660
Yeah,
sure.

1418
01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:24.860
<v 15>Music and comedy are really colliding in a big way right now.
Yeah.</v>

1419
01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:28.170
Well I went bumping Mike's came out of sort of getting all these messages from

1420
01:31:28.171 --> 01:31:32.850
musicians.
Really.
Drake,
Drake hardest I ever laughed.

1421
01:31:32.851 --> 01:31:36.630
DMD May don't even barely know.
The guy who just found me on Instagram.
Loved it.

1422
01:31:36.631 --> 01:31:40.080
Loved it.
It was crazy.
I know.
It's really been fun.

1423
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:41.950
Really Been Fun.
Yes.
I ask

1424
01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:46.520
<v 14>you something,
you said that a roasting was anti bullying,
which I think is,</v>

1425
01:31:46.521 --> 01:31:51.050
I 100% agree with you,
but in this current bullshit,

1426
01:31:51.051 --> 01:31:53.120
social justice warrior culture,

1427
01:31:53.570 --> 01:31:58.520
I feel like people mistaken busting chops are busting balls for like not having

1428
01:31:58.521 --> 01:32:00.190
sympathy a particular group.

1429
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:01.023
<v 15>It's like,
dude,</v>

1430
01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:06.130
why can't I have sympathy for somebody and make a joke about them at the same

1431
01:32:06.131 --> 01:32:06.761
time?
Like,

1432
01:32:06.761 --> 01:32:11.761
do you find that you're bumping up against people being fucking pussies about

1433
01:32:12.371 --> 01:32:12.780
this stuff?

1434
01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:15.570
<v 13>Well,
or just upset about everything?
You know,</v>

1435
01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:19.970
I'm offended by people that are constantly offended.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1436
01:32:20.130 --> 01:32:23.190
It's wearing me out.
It's like everything.

1437
01:32:23.191 --> 01:32:26.640
If it's a new language now I quit my job.

1438
01:32:26.641 --> 01:32:30.390
I was so humiliated,
you know,
toughen up.

1439
01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:36.190
I mean,
Jesus lifestyle.
Yeah.
So,

1440
01:32:37.050 --> 01:32:39.240
you know,
I had a rough childhood.

1441
01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:43.770
It's not as bad as some of the ones that I wasn't separated from my parents at

1442
01:32:43.771 --> 01:32:45.630
the border.
Yeah.
But you know,

1443
01:32:45.631 --> 01:32:49.590
my parents were sick and they died when I was a teenager.
And I go,

1444
01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:54.860
I think that gave me thick skin to talk about morning and moving on.

1445
01:32:54.901 --> 01:32:59.550
And how did you know,
he think kids didn't tease me.
And it's like,

1446
01:33:00.210 --> 01:33:00.871
you know,

1447
01:33:00.871 --> 01:33:04.470
jokes and you gotta be able to like handle your business or what are you,

1448
01:33:04.471 --> 01:33:07.440
what are you doing?
You're just worried,
you know,

1449
01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:11.130
social media has made that more of a,

1450
01:33:12.450 --> 01:33:16.430
of a thing right now.
But you know,
I just,
I'm,

1451
01:33:16.431 --> 01:33:21.360
I'm not into the wimpy pussy culture,
meaning either,
you know,

1452
01:33:21.361 --> 01:33:26.100
women,
women are equals women should need to be able to be part of the labs and

1453
01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:29.880
disabled people need to be part of the,
be able to take a joke and,
and,

1454
01:33:29.890 --> 01:33:33.210
and every ethnicity needs to be able to take the joke.

1455
01:33:33.211 --> 01:33:36.300
And I find no two of the people listening to my podcasts,

1456
01:33:36.301 --> 01:33:37.980
those are the people coming to our show.

1457
01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:42.930
<v 15>Most fun people at shows.
Oh my God.
When you're listing the best audience.
Yeah,</v>

1458
01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:47.500
I've heard that the fucking best.
Cause they've been through some shit.
Yeah.

1459
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:49.360
Rich boss told me that there's a great one.

1460
01:33:49.361 --> 01:33:54.220
Fucking gay dudes are the best here in the valley.
Uh,
that Guy Bang court run.

1461
01:33:54.221 --> 01:33:57.270
Yes.
That's a jam at a show.
We would,

1462
01:33:57.350 --> 01:34:02.100
we'd do it like once every six months.
I did it a couple times,
man.

1463
01:34:02.510 --> 01:34:05.670
So game there.
Sounds cool.
Yeah.

1464
01:34:06.710 --> 01:34:07.341
<v 13>More like,
yeah,</v>

1465
01:34:07.341 --> 01:34:10.580
it's fun to perform for people that are paying and of course we need to do that

1466
01:34:10.581 --> 01:34:15.560
and,
and we appreciate our fans,
but when I go to like a jail or,

1467
01:34:15.561 --> 01:34:19.880
or,
you know,
I've done shows for the homeless.
I've done shows for,
you know,

1468
01:34:20.210 --> 01:34:21.860
in war zones.
Those are them.

1469
01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:25.220
<v 15>That's crowd.
Yeah.
They're not paying,
they're not drinking.</v>

1470
01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:29.150
They're there because they need it.
Yeah.
It's,
it's,
it's medicine.

1471
01:34:29.210 --> 01:34:31.940
You've gone abroad.
You don't want your medicine water down either.

1472
01:34:31.941 --> 01:34:36.560
You want a potent,
yeah,
bro.
You've done the war zone shit a lot,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1473
01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:41.480
That's wild.
That's wild.
That's a really,
really,
I do.
I did get mo once.

1474
01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:45.500
That was cool.
That was cool.
She did.
What year was that?
Do you remember?

1475
01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:51.080
Get Mo?
Yeah.
Oh nine yeah,
I did that.
No,
five.
It was really,

1476
01:34:51.230 --> 01:34:54.590
that was maybe the best show I've ever had in my life.
Yeah,
there was,

1477
01:34:54.770 --> 01:34:58.310
they were great.
Shows are just so star for these marines

1478
01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:03.350
<v 13>and Navy and so on to live on one Tottenham obey base,</v>

1479
01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:05.240
naval base,
you know,

1480
01:35:05.241 --> 01:35:10.241
and obviously there's a whole stigma in a dark cloud of of Guantanamo Bay.

1481
01:35:10.311 --> 01:35:12.770
The terrorists are there and the torture and,

1482
01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:17.210
but there's also a whole other gigantic military community.

1483
01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:21.890
Even part of the prison yeah.
Was most of it's not right.
Yeah.
And as you know,

1484
01:35:21.891 --> 01:35:24.260
those,
those are great crowds and Oh yeah,

1485
01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:28.800
there's families living in there and it's like the military shows up in gray

1486
01:35:28.801 --> 01:35:32.740
because I got to see stuff that normal people don't get to see.
And I,

1487
01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:33.770
I really dig that.

1488
01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:37.500
<v 14>Did she go to Afghanistan?
I've been there.
Yeah,
I did that to you.</v>

1489
01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:39.290
You slept with the whole seal team,
right?

1490
01:35:39.291 --> 01:35:42.800
Didn't you hook up with everybody in the seal teams?
Teams six,

1491
01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:47.050
that's all they got the nickname [inaudible] sex.

1492
01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:49.730
Did you ever do,

1493
01:35:49.731 --> 01:35:54.410
there's an oil platform in the middle of the fucking ocean between Iran and
Iraq.

1494
01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:57.340
There's like an a mile long oil platforms and they fly.

1495
01:35:57.350 --> 01:36:01.550
Have you ever done that one play out?
That was crazy.
And half of it's US marine.

1496
01:36:01.551 --> 01:36:05.300
Half of it's I'm Iraqi soldiers Thursday and they butt fuck each other on a

1497
01:36:05.301 --> 01:36:06.410
platform.
And you got,

1498
01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:10.220
they showed me the fuck mattresses and stuff and I just sleep with like guards

1499
01:36:10.221 --> 01:36:14.630
outside of my,
um,
you know,
it's not a room.
It's those,
those metal,

1500
01:36:14.690 --> 01:36:18.020
what do they call those metal boxes?
They have them everywhere,

1501
01:36:18.021 --> 01:36:20.800
like in Djibouti and shit in the marriage.
Like if you're in a war zone,

1502
01:36:20.830 --> 01:36:25.160
just have fun,
you know?
Yeah.
I get it.
You never know.
Iraqi soldiers,

1503
01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:29.500
the war zone becomes a horror zone.
Hey God,

1504
01:36:32.130 --> 01:36:35.150
that's great that you do.
That's great that you do that and that's,
I love you.

1505
01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:39.800
A woman comedian in a war zone.
Like it's so rare.
It was nuts.
I did Afghanistan,

1506
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:44.590
I did Saudi Arabia.
I even got to go in to do Riyadh based there.

1507
01:36:44.730 --> 01:36:47.750
I was fucking nuts.
The UAE,
I would never do it again.

1508
01:36:47.751 --> 01:36:52.310
Djibouti Malia,
I would never do it again.
It's so dangerous.

1509
01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:57.620
Worst place I've ever been worse.
Yeah.
It was like 140 degrees or so.

1510
01:36:57.621 --> 01:37:00.540
Fucking high ze your hand.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was terrifying.

1511
01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:03.620
Terrible there for one long day.

1512
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:05.870
<v 13>Stop over in the Middle East,
the Middle East.</v>

1513
01:37:06.770 --> 01:37:10.100
And I was there with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Richard

1514
01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:14.180
Myers at the time and oh five and they call it the chairman's tour where he's,

1515
01:37:14.630 --> 01:37:15.590
he stops,
you know,

1516
01:37:15.591 --> 01:37:20.591
during the holidays and like eight or nine countries and some of them are safe

1517
01:37:21.231 --> 01:37:22.064
and some of them aren't.

1518
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:26.450
But he even walked up on stage and Djibouti and was like,
hey man,
you guys,

1519
01:37:26.930 --> 01:37:29.810
hat's off to you,
your station in the worst place.
We have

1520
01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:33.300
<v 14>worse.
He was very upfront about it.
There was no getting around.
I know.</v>

1521
01:37:33.301 --> 01:37:37.650
This sucks.
Yeah,
it's amazing.
And then we,
and we had just been to Iraq,

1522
01:37:37.651 --> 01:37:41.150
so like he's really laying it down there.
Yeah.

1523
01:37:41.610 --> 01:37:46.160
I never did Iraq.
I've been to,
um,
well I said uh,

1524
01:37:46.170 --> 01:37:47.560
Afghanistan,
Iraq

1525
01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:52.010
<v 13>cause genuinely fascinating and terrifying.
I've been here three times.</v>

1526
01:37:53.810 --> 01:37:58.810
It's no different in an o three than it is two years ago when I was there or

1527
01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:02.730
where you go back to war zones.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I went,

1528
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:07.410
I went two Christmases ago.
I guess,
and sadly will,

1529
01:38:07.411 --> 01:38:11.310
I'll have to keep going because it doesn't sound like any of that ends ending in

1530
01:38:11.311 --> 01:38:12.144
my lifetime.

1531
01:38:12.990 --> 01:38:17.990
Be Nice if all those Saddam palaces were casinos by now.

1532
01:38:18.970 --> 01:38:22.440
Yeah.
I think Trump would have made that happen.
Right,
right.
But no,

1533
01:38:23.090 --> 01:38:27.800
<v 4>no.
You know who I went with Sarah Tiana,
right near a homey.
It,
she's the best.</v>

1534
01:38:27.801 --> 01:38:28.850
She's the best.

1535
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.240
<v 13>Oh.
And I did,
uh,
did a,
um,
some USO stuff together too.
We went to,
um,</v>

1536
01:38:34.130 --> 01:38:38.960
um,
Germany to Lanch Landstuhl Medical Hospital did a show.

1537
01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:43.260
<v 4>She's the sweetest,
she's a killer.
He's a killer.
Keller talented.</v>

1538
01:38:43.710 --> 01:38:47.550
And she really gets it.
I remember we were touring these bases and she was just,

1539
01:38:47.551 --> 01:38:51.280
her heart went out to all,
like,
I was such a selfish kind of dig.

1540
01:38:51.281 --> 01:38:55.320
I was complaining that it's hot and the food's not good.
And Sarah was just like,

1541
01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:59.300
that's not why we're here.
Christina.
You know,
like,
she's so mature,
so smart.

1542
01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:02.190
<v 13>She's just something special about her.
Yeah.
She,</v>

1543
01:39:02.230 --> 01:39:06.200
she's a really incredible person and a great writer,
great comedian,
great friend.

1544
01:39:06.830 --> 01:39:11.300
She was bawling last night.
Right in the front row at the Brody.
Yeah,
no,

1545
01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:16.250
yeah,
we work together with Brody on the burn on comedy central.

1546
01:39:16.251 --> 01:39:18.840
Sarah was one of the writers and Brody was there,

1547
01:39:18.841 --> 01:39:23.510
a warm up guy and it was a real family for 12 episodes.

1548
01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:26.450
That's show business,
you know,
the shows come and go.

1549
01:39:26.451 --> 01:39:30.530
I always think like the shows,
the projects,
the pilots,
they come and go,

1550
01:39:30.531 --> 01:39:34.100
but these relationships are what sustain us.
Yeah.
You know,

1551
01:39:34.101 --> 01:39:37.520
you're talking about talking to me years ago before we even knew each other.

1552
01:39:37.521 --> 01:39:39.160
We had a relationship.
Yeah,
yeah.
No,

1553
01:39:39.170 --> 01:39:43.220
it's like when you're on stage and there's that intensity and he went into

1554
01:39:43.221 --> 01:39:47.130
another guy in a strange town and he's pacing and he's nervous.
Oh,

1555
01:39:47.380 --> 01:39:50.700
am I going to make it harder for them or worse for him?
It's like side,
you know?

1556
01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:54.480
Who are you?
I just had a flashback to another one of talking to you.
Oh,

1557
01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:58.970
I did the Melrose Improv and uh,
you know,

1558
01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:03.020
I was booked on the show.
It must have been like,
oh

1559
01:40:03.210 --> 01:40:07.470
<v 0>six or seven.
And I had,
I had a great set,</v>

1560
01:40:07.890 --> 01:40:11.870
like a great set and you were on the show and then,
you know,

1561
01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:16.560
people kind of gather afterwards,
outside out front.

1562
01:40:17.610 --> 01:40:21.690
And I just like stood next to you and,
and uh,

1563
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:26.550
you're talking to other people and other comics and I just like just like stood

1564
01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:30.870
kinda like waiting and then you looked at me and you're like,

1565
01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:33.870
you got a great set.
That was hilarious.
I was like,
thanks man.

1566
01:40:34.170 --> 01:40:35.480
And then I just kept staring at you.

1567
01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:39.730
<v 13>Wow.
Yeah.
What was going on there?
I just wanted to like,
yeah,</v>

1568
01:40:39.731 --> 01:40:43.780
I just want it to like be part of the group.
Wow.
You know what I mean?
So I think,

1569
01:40:43.781 --> 01:40:46.000
yeah,
I think I probably freaked you out at a certain point.

1570
01:40:46.001 --> 01:40:48.370
I definitely saw you look at me like,
all right man.
Yeah.

1571
01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:51.780
And there's no way I watched your set,
so I was just Kinda Nice.

1572
01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:55.180
<v 6>Yeah,
I definitely was like,</v>

1573
01:40:56.140 --> 01:40:58.450
I can remember vividly standing out there.
Well,

1574
01:40:58.460 --> 01:41:00.790
I've found this to be nice because now looking at we're friends.

1575
01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:05.080
I felt like I'm the queen of Showbiz when one time Sarah town,

1576
01:41:05.081 --> 01:41:09.790
I took me into your house for a barbecue like a decade ago and I was like,

1577
01:41:09.791 --> 01:41:13.110
oh my God.
Right Jeff Ross or were you like,
oh we're,

1578
01:41:13.111 --> 01:41:16.030
this is just like a war zone.
Everything goes suck all these dicks.
Yeah.

1579
01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:20.350
Much Barbecue Dick.
Um,
since we were,
by the way,
since Christina's far,

1580
01:41:20.351 --> 01:41:24.640
it was so disappointing.
Darya,
can you pull up,
there's a,

1581
01:41:24.641 --> 01:41:26.050
we haven't seen seen this yet,

1582
01:41:26.110 --> 01:41:30.850
but this is supposed to be the check that's going to make you really,

1583
01:41:31.450 --> 01:41:35.650

I thought I had a fire,
but watch this.
Okay.

1589
01:41:49.620 --> 01:41:53.760
<v 6>Oh,

Okay.
So let's see who we've seen.
That's what you have here.</v>

1594
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:11.223
<v 7>oh,</v>

We watch it.

1596
01:42:18.150 --> 01:42:22.610
<v 6>Growth rubbing and bananas on her ass on calling in the SPANDEX.
What?</v>

1597
01:42:22.830 --> 01:42:26.760
What had happened?
She smells,
I had stayed home with my housekeeper.

1598
01:42:26.761 --> 01:42:28.430
Elvia I've seen that

Really?

1600

I don't remember this.
A whole bunch of things.

1601
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:39.560
Renames them with Fart in the word.
Okay.

This is your,</v>

1603

It's pretty easy.
Oh yes.

1604
01:42:49.390 --> 01:42:50.270
Crazy Barrow.

1605
01:42:50.690 --> 01:42:54.770
<v 10>Keep that part in mind.
Okay.
We're now going,
are we rating them?
I think so.
Yeah.</v>

1606
01:42:54.771 --> 01:42:59.620
We're ranking these here.
The next part.
Nana.

1607
01:42:59.870 --> 01:43:00.800
Nana.

Yeah.
Yeah.
There's a reason.</v>

1609
01:43:05.290 --> 01:43:07.650
She's pretty cute.
I like the shed farts.
Yeah.

1610
01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:14.510
Well girls do that.
Yeah.

1611
01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:20.740
I never saw a girl do that before with like the reverb.

1612
01:43:20.741 --> 01:43:23.950
Kind of like the base.
I didn't have no girl Fargo though.
Right now

1613
01:43:26.750 --> 01:43:31.270
I know what I like about that far fart.
I will say Tommy,

1614
01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:33.670
I feel like there was heat to it.

1615
01:43:33.700 --> 01:43:36.430
I feel like she had apricot's like those trader Joe's ones.

1616
01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:40.600
Why can't I get ready to re rank everything new champ.

1617
01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:44.290
I remember this vividly.
This is really intense.

I love the name for that.

01:44:34.210 --> 01:44:37.820
Really a lot of guys will pay to watch women fart.
Really?
Yeah.

1630
01:44:37.850 --> 01:44:42.140

The one guy who wrote in about it is that he,

1631
01:44:42.170 --> 01:44:47.170
he said that the reason he has a fetish for it is because it's like the taboo

1632
01:44:47.511 --> 01:44:52.090
thing to see a pretty girl having like a dirty smell,
you know?

1633
01:44:52.130 --> 01:44:55.970
And what about this one that's different?
She's,
yeah,

1634
01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:59.720
she's just,
that's just her skill.
Not that she's bad looking,

1635
01:44:59.750 --> 01:45:01.640
but I don't think of her as a,
no,

1636
01:45:01.641 --> 01:45:06.410
I think you were typically pretty girl laying in bed in the tee shirt going on

1637
01:45:06.411 --> 01:45:07.370
here.
My alarm.

1638
01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:12.670
<v 6>I think your instincts are dead on.
I see your point.</v>

1639
01:45:12.671 --> 01:45:15.280
So what you're trying to say is there was no,

1640
01:45:16.150 --> 01:45:19.920
there was no set up to this one.
It wasn't as creative as the fart.
Nana

1641
01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:26.620
whale.
A blowhole
Gotcha.

1642
01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:31.480
Yeah.
Yeah.
A little hard on the eyes.
Oh,
this is all set up.

1643
01:45:34.330 --> 01:45:36.940
I like that one.
Ooh.
Mop on aisle five.

1644
01:45:39.250 --> 01:45:42.430
What's the fucking on her belt there?
She's got like a hike.

1645
01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:47.440
One of those climbing hooks?
Yeah,
like carabiners.
That's what that's called.

1646
01:45:48.190 --> 01:45:52.630
Yeah.
Okay.
Now what's this in the porn genre?

1647
01:45:52.631 --> 01:45:56.030
When they do it out in the wild.
What's that called in the porn,
John?

1648
01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:57.700
I don't know.
I don't know what that's called.

1649
01:45:57.701 --> 01:46:02.701
Face not a face fart when you make porn out and like on public,

1650
01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:07.300
public public.
This is a public park.
Voyeurism.
[inaudible] something like that.

1651
01:46:07.410 --> 01:46:08.780
Josh,
Josh

1652
01:46:09.630 --> 01:46:14.180
<v 15>subscribes,
all of these.
So this was a public fart.
That was really interesting.</v>

1653
01:46:14.510 --> 01:46:16.460
What are those are,
those are all five parts.
I mean,

1654
01:46:16.461 --> 01:46:20.080
which one was your favorite one?
Well,
let's go through and cheesy.
Well yeah,

1655
01:46:20.090 --> 01:46:24.440
the lady who was reading the book.
No,
no bananas.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1656
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:29.780
Come on.
Yeah,
it cause it's part Anna's,
yeah,
I just love bananas.

1657
01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:34.550
My grandpa used to say take a banana for the ride.
Okay.

1658
01:46:34.590 --> 01:46:38.240
Those early.
Uh,
I mean I just love bananas and they're good.
Bright.

1659
01:46:38.241 --> 01:46:40.820
Before you go on stage [inaudible] or no,

1660
01:46:42.170 --> 01:46:46.520
I don't think I would eat the fart bananas.
Bananas.
I don't think I really get

1661
01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:49.530
what she's doing there.

1662
01:46:50.750 --> 01:46:52.950
I think she's going to throw those away or just saved them.

1663
01:46:52.951 --> 01:46:56.010
But I think she's saving quite a bit about if she peeled it Neda down.

1664
01:46:57.270 --> 01:47:00.540
There's a guy that does that,
but I dunno if you want to see that.

1665
01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:05.880
<v 4>I I'm going to,
I don't like shed fart because that was just very generic.</v>

1666
01:47:05.940 --> 01:47:10.200
It was like,
yeah,
I'm going to shed.
Yeah.
I mean,
yeah,
I'm in the shed,

1667
01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:11.970
but why?
There's a reason.

1668
01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:16.620
What's the reason you have to go in the shed the fart.
That doesn't make sense,

1669
01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:19.280
<v 7>Huh?</v>

1670
01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:23.650
<v 4>Pardon the shit?
Yeah,
but why this you?
She has a fart shed.
Yeah.</v>

1671
01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:25.430
Like she has her own shed for four.

1672
01:47:25.530 --> 01:47:29.790
<v 15>Well,
she's not going to fall on her podcast.
We'll do that material.</v>

1673
01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:38.560
She went out to the shed like a lady.
Right?
Right.

1674
01:47:38.561 --> 01:47:42.130
So,
wait,
is there a new person?
Is that what you're saying?
Yeah,
there is.

1675
01:47:42.131 --> 01:47:45.070
Why don't you guys discuss who gets ranked number one,

1676
01:47:45.071 --> 01:47:46.930
two and three and I'll pull up this new foreign minister.

1677
01:47:47.190 --> 01:47:48.660
<v 4>Okay.
Okay.</v>

1678
01:47:48.750 --> 01:47:52.770
I can't believe I'm going to go for him personally.

1679
01:47:52.771 --> 01:47:56.370
I don't think the shed fart was that exciting.
I'm going to give her fifth place.

1680
01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:59.760
Yeah.
I don't know.
Do you guys agree with this ranking?
Yeah.
Last place.

1681
01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:04.400
<v 15>Nothing for me.
For me.
It's all about the book lady Breely.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
What?</v>

1682
01:48:04.410 --> 01:48:06.740
What are you going to give her first place?
Oh yeah.
For me,

1683
01:48:06.741 --> 01:48:09.740
she's seriously for sure.
Why?
I mean,
just the,

1684
01:48:09.741 --> 01:48:12.310
like the way that it was so dominant and,

1685
01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:16.940
and like there was so much muscle behind it and the way she was so nonchalant,

1686
01:48:16.941 --> 01:48:21.410
like,
gosh,
it just shouldn't even look up from the book.
Oh yeah.

1687
01:48:21.710 --> 01:48:24.950
It's really owned it,
you know?
All right.
I'll just disagree.

1688
01:48:25.010 --> 01:48:27.850
I've filled the sponsor to show toilet paper.

1689
01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:32.450
Used to be Mcdonald's,
but they left,
so

1690
01:48:33.980 --> 01:48:38.360
I liked the public farter because it's a brave,
it's bold.
Oh,
right.

1691
01:48:38.450 --> 01:48:42.680
It's risky.
That took nerve a little bit in the supermarket.
Yeah.
Yeah,

1692
01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:44.960
a little bit,
but it wasn't,

1693
01:48:45.110 --> 01:48:48.440
I liked the bananas on strictly on the performance art of it all.
Yeah.

1694
01:48:48.441 --> 01:48:51.470
The performance part of it all.
The performance artist.
Yeah.

1695
01:48:51.610 --> 01:48:54.640
<v 4>I'm going to,
I'm torn between the Fart Nana and the Valentine for it.</v>

1696
01:48:54.641 --> 01:48:57.720
I liked the Valentine premise.
She's like,
hey guys,

1697
01:48:57.721 --> 01:49:01.820
as a felon times day and here's a fart that was on this,
that one time for it.

1698
01:49:01.821 --> 01:49:01.980
Yeah.

1699
01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:03.750
<v 15>Yeah.
Right here in your heart.
Here's a valentines.</v>

1700
01:49:03.850 --> 01:49:04.261
<v 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1701
01:49:04.261 --> 01:49:08.470
It was Kinda Nice that she gave you the gift and I liked that she plugs her

1702
01:49:08.471 --> 01:49:12.110
channel.
So scribe line,
right.
She puts the plug out and then

1703
01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:15.360
<v 15>delivers.
Yeah.
I just didn't feel like the delivery was there.
Who's this?</v>

1704
01:49:15.390 --> 01:49:18.480
This is our new person.
This is the new girl.
And uh,
when I saw it,

1705
01:49:18.481 --> 01:49:20.520
I knew we had something special.
Okay.

1706
01:49:21.380 --> 01:49:23.030
<v 7>These make me so gassy.</v>

1707
01:49:27.970 --> 01:49:31.700
Right?
These are what my farts are going to smell it.
Oh my God.

1708
01:49:36.030 --> 01:49:40.350
<v 15>I don't know what I like more than what she's doing or watching Jeff watcher.</v>

1709
01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:42.380
I don't know if she's farting or belching.

1710
01:49:43.990 --> 01:49:44.823
<v 7>I love this.</v>

1711
01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:54.970
Whoa.
I didn't get it.

1712
01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:01.030
Whoa.
Uh,
hey man.

1713
01:50:01.690 --> 01:50:06.600
What's going on?
Exactly.
It's like around us.
This seems like it's in the

1714
01:50:08.650 --> 01:50:13.330
gluttonous.
This is the queen ass rubber.
I didn't know Steve's got a wig.

1715
01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:16.420
This is pretty wild,
man.
That's the belly button.

1716
01:50:16.421 --> 01:50:20.490
Looks like an ass climbing on me the road.

1717
01:50:22.180 --> 01:50:23.230
Oh,
okay.

1718
01:50:27.970 --> 01:50:32.560
This is a little much.
Okay.
She's trying too hard.
Yeah.

1719
01:50:32.770 --> 01:50:36.370
We haven't even gotten to the phone trying to heart.
This girl has talent.

1720
01:50:36.610 --> 01:50:37.960
This is really good.

1721
01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:47.890
Okay.
I don't know if I can,

1722
01:50:48.710 --> 01:50:53.050
I'm in love.
I think I'm going to gay.
Married her.
I love this check.

1723
01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:57.610
I am blown away by this talent.
Listen,
king ass ripper was amazing.

1724
01:50:57.700 --> 01:51:02.140
This chick kicks his ass.
You think so dude?
Can you ask her is nothing

1725
01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:07.040
<v 15>right?
This is,
I don't know.
To be fair to be first.
Not to be fair.</v>

1726
01:51:07.041 --> 01:51:08.270
This is a trans woman.

1727
01:51:08.700 --> 01:51:13.320
<v 7>Wait a minute.
Pipe.
I Dunno.
I think it is.
Am I right?</v>

1728
01:51:13.321 --> 01:51:17.670
Okay.
Do you think it's transforming?
I think you're onto something.
Yeah.
Shit man.

1729
01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:21.210
Listen,
without some of the original piping.
Is there trans fats?
You mean

1730
01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:28.530
fucking look at that big cushy,
yeah.
Can I have some?

1731
01:51:28.531 --> 01:51:30.360
You're watering email that I want to have a big butt,

1732
01:51:30.390 --> 01:51:35.300
but it's definitely a gassy one.
Okay.
We're good.
Oh yeah,

1733
01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:39.120
it's working.
I want to hear the farm.
I just think it's great than Andy.

1734
01:51:39.150 --> 01:51:40.680
Mellanox has a youtube page.

1735
01:51:45.370 --> 01:51:50.080
<v 15>Oh my God,
Dude.
I'm impressed.
I mean,
is it true?
Is it,</v>

1736
01:51:50.090 --> 01:51:54.550
is she trans?
Yeah.
Blue Band.
Is it confirmed?
I think she is.

1737
01:51:54.890 --> 01:51:57.910
I mean,
looking at the definition of the yards,
I think it's a possibility.
Hmm.

1738
01:51:58.110 --> 01:52:01.840
Hate.
No.
Uh,
have you been to Israel before?
Yes.
Did you perform there?

1739
01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:03.650
It's quite a segue.
I know

1740
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:09.070
you're asking me about how the farting is over there.
What was it like?

1741
01:52:09.071 --> 01:52:12.090
Did you find a lot of Mediterranean food will kind of go through Oh,

1742
01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:15.940
the Shwarma uh,
yeah.
I,
I've been,

1743
01:52:15.970 --> 01:52:20.440
I performed there twice,
most recently.
Um,
uh,

1744
01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:22.420
just a year ago with Chris Rock,

1745
01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:27.310
I was a surprise guest on his Telaviv show that show ever,

1746
01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:31.750
ever update with my get Moesha seriously the best.

1747
01:52:32.170 --> 01:52:36.040
What was it like doing rocks tour?
I loved every second of it.

1748
01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:40.690
I love spending time with Chris.
Um,
I would do,

1749
01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:43.930
I would do,
he would have me go on right before him and,

1750
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:46.010
and do my standup and then bring

1751
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:48.800
<v 13>up,
and these are huge arenas.
10,
15,000,</v>

1752
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:53.360
and I'd work it out with security where I'd bring up volunteers from the front

1753
01:52:53.361 --> 01:52:56.270
sections,
line them up to speed,

1754
01:52:56.271 --> 01:52:59.810
roast the shit out of him in arena style Copenhagen,

1755
01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:05.900
Stockholm.
All through Ireland and England and man,
you know,

1756
01:53:05.901 --> 01:53:10.240
as it was,
it was amazing experience in all these foreign countries and we,

1757
01:53:10.241 --> 01:53:14.510
we made a stop and Tel Aviv and you know,
people just,

Yeah,

1760
01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:23.870
everyone's down.
What we were doing,

1761
01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:27.950
what I was saying and even though I wouldn't understand all the accents and

1762
01:53:27.951 --> 01:53:31.500
Sweden,
they got everything we said and it was like,

1763
01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:34.910
it was a really great experience.
You had to like nothing.
Same,

1764
01:53:34.940 --> 01:53:36.110
same act I do here,

1765
01:53:36.410 --> 01:53:41.410
except they're more eager to hear about Trump and politics and what our take is

1766
01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:46.700
was on it.
And they,
they all know Christmas specials from over the years.

1767
01:53:46.701 --> 01:53:47.750
I learned how to speak English.

1768
01:53:47.751 --> 01:53:51.970
A lot of people listening to Chris Rock and Eddie Murphy and wow.

1769
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:54.920
And that kind of stuff.
Wild.
It was really,
really cool.

1770
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:58.260
And that was the tour that ended up being the tambourine right,
right,
right.
Yeah.

1771
01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:01.340
That's awesome.
It's been really fun.
Probably gonna ramp up again,

1772
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:05.030
I think in another year or so he'll start thinking about it again because it's

1773
01:54:05.031 --> 01:54:07.130
just,
it's too juicy.
Yeah.

1774
01:54:07.370 --> 01:54:10.580
Lots of people want to see him in every corner of the world.

1775
01:54:10.581 --> 01:54:13.040
There's places he still hasn't gone.
Yeah.

1776
01:54:13.070 --> 01:54:16.940
He put the act together in a year and he tours her for a year.
Yeah.

1777
01:54:17.530 --> 01:54:21.440
It's amazing.
And he's sent me,
sent me a,

1778
01:54:21.441 --> 01:54:24.380
a three wheeled motorcycle as a present.
Why?

1779
01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:27.950
I almost drove it here and just learning how to drive it.
Cause the stick.

1780
01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:33.890
But it's,
it's incredible.
Awesome thing.
I would never buy myself.
Really?

1781
01:54:33.980 --> 01:54:38.120
Yeah.
It's a motorcycle.
It's a three wheeled motorcycle.

1782
01:54:38.121 --> 01:54:42.380
It's called a slingshot.
Oh,
I've seen those really fun.
That's manual.

1783
01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:47.580
Yeah.
Oh,
I got to see this thing.
I'll show you a picture after.
Okay.
Okay.

1784
01:54:48.110 --> 01:54:49.520
Well this guy,
is this an Israel?

1785
01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:53.660
<v 10>Um,
the guy talking to him is definitely Israeli.
Okay.</v>

1786
01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:55.530
100% sure if this is Israel.
It looks like it might.
Yeah.

1787
01:54:55.690 --> 01:54:58.010
<v 13>And you're saying this guy puts on quite a show that we're watching?</v>

1788
01:54:58.260 --> 01:55:02.610
<v 10>Yeah.
He actually reminds me of someone that we used to have on the show.
Okay.</v>

1789
01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:03.480
Let's see.

1790
01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:08.330
<v 2>Hi,
Ms. Dot.
Malik food

1791
01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:12.353
Wait,

1792
01:55:17.110 --> 01:55:19.830
wait.
I'll go on.
Pay Half the bomb.

1793
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:24.290
<v 13>So this is an Elvis impersonator,</v>

1794
01:55:24.850 --> 01:55:29.350
<v 4>I think.
I love foreigners doing stupid shit,
man.</v>

1795
01:55:30.010 --> 01:55:31.480
You know,
one time in Hungary,

1796
01:55:31.510 --> 01:55:36.070
my parents are from Hungary and we went to go see some stupid lounge act and the

1797
01:55:36.071 --> 01:55:39.010
mill of,
anyway,
they see,
they don't know.

1798
01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:42.730
They can't speak English fluently and it was the sun.
Oh,

1799
01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:44.370
zinc device

1800
01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:47.340
<v 15>is another day for you in Paris.</v>

1801
01:55:47.370 --> 01:55:51.120
Like they couldn't say the words and the style.
Laughing so fucking hard.

1802
01:55:51.630 --> 01:55:56.400
I love when foreigners can't just staying alive guy.
Yeah,

1803
01:55:56.490 --> 01:56:00.390
yeah,
yeah.
Do you have stay United State United State.
You will not stay United.

1804
01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:05.460
Stay United.
Yeah.
I love this kind of shit.
Yeah,
this is damn it.

1805
01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:10.500
This guy would probably impress Jeff.
Oh my goodness.

1806
01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:13.150
<v 17>They United States United stand.
You know</v>

1807
01:56:15.340 --> 01:56:19.540
that you've been knocking guys felt even uh,

1808
01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:21.390
uh,
uh,

1809
01:56:28.330 --> 01:56:31.860
you're weighting based data.
Bitch did it.
We made it.
Now,

1810
01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:35.630
why is daddy and I went dead,
I suppose are the words.

1811
01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:39.320
So I'm by no,
no,
I go and buy shows.

1812
01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:43.670
So you're not as you United that your name is [inaudible].

1813
01:56:46.230 --> 01:56:50.780
<v 15>Oh Wow.
Would you,
would he be hard to roast or no?
He seems rough.</v>

1814
01:56:50.781 --> 01:56:52.880
Stubble.
Yeah.
He looks like he's already been roasted.

1815
01:56:55.420 --> 01:56:56.211
Wow.
By far,

1816
01:56:56.211 --> 01:56:59.480
the most fun I've ever had watching someone's watch clips on this show has been

1817
01:56:59.481 --> 01:57:00.300
Jeff Ross.

1818
01:57:00.300 --> 01:57:05.300
I would love to play tic tac toe on his forehead and what is going on his teeth

1819
01:57:05.361 --> 01:57:09.680
look like Stonehenge
that's going on with this guy,

1820
01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:16.740
but yet remarkably fashionable penny and,
and aviators.
Yeah.

1821
01:57:17.330 --> 01:57:19.760
And might even have hair plugs this guy,

1822
01:57:19.790 --> 01:57:24.320
but yet never put sunscreen on at once in his life and never been to a dentist.

1823
01:57:24.321 --> 01:57:29.040
The nearest tennis is 10,000 miles away.
He's Moroccan.
Yeah.

1824
01:57:29.060 --> 01:57:33.620
That's where he fell.
I see a lot of outdoor time.
Always gets his son.

1825
01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:37.120
<v 17>Oh
Jesus.</v>

1826
01:57:42.100 --> 01:57:42.933
Okay.

1827
01:57:43.180 --> 01:57:44.050
<v 15>Um,
I like,</v>

1828
01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:47.730
Elvis is something that he knows is on the Internet and think he knows he's on

1829
01:57:47.731 --> 01:57:49.950
your podcast.
I don't know if he knows me out of the pocket.

1830
01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:54.860
But after we found that video,
people started to send in other videos.
Okay.

1831
01:57:55.230 --> 01:57:57.630
So he makes videos and posts some of them singing?
No,

1832
01:57:57.631 --> 01:58:02.310
I think he allows people to film him.
Oh.
And in like public places.

1833
01:58:02.850 --> 01:58:07.410
Um,
and then,
you know,
cause there's,
I think he's in Spain now,

1834
01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:10.060
right?
Yeah,
he's on tour

1835
01:58:11.730 --> 01:58:14.910
in Morocco or something.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Um,

1836
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:16.710
he should have a show called [inaudible] skin.

1837
01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:21.150
<v 17>No,
me.</v>

1838
01:58:21.150 --> 01:58:25.850
<v 15>Him.
I would love to have him on.</v>

1839
01:58:26.510 --> 01:58:30.620
He would just do stay alive over and over though.
Huh?
Hey.

1840
01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:38.720
You'd be like,
yeah,
we got it.
We got it.
Wait,
so we'll bump in.
Mike's come back.

1841
01:58:39.150 --> 01:58:42.270
We're going to do a tour this summer,
May and June.
Oh you are?

1842
01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:43.480
<v 13>Yeah.
We'll be at the more God,</v>

1843
01:58:43.490 --> 01:58:47.140
I will be at the sands and Bethlehem and then we're picking up some more dates

1844
01:58:47.141 --> 01:58:51.370
soon as I can get Dave to agree.
Is that,
that's the work of it,
right?
Oh so hard.

1845
01:58:52.030 --> 01:58:54.850
He's got,
you know,
tornadoes himself all the time.

1846
01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:57.480
He doesn't want to split the money.
There's,
I want to go to Florida.

1847
01:58:57.530 --> 01:58:58.660
Like there's a lot of rules.

1848
01:58:59.670 --> 01:59:03.580
It doesn't go anywhere where he has his family really smart.

1849
01:59:04.090 --> 01:59:05.470
He won't wants to avoid it.

1850
01:59:05.560 --> 01:59:10.560
He wants to go to casinos in the Midwest and south and North Pacific where he

1851
01:59:11.021 --> 01:59:13.570
doesn't know anybody where they let them smoke in the elevators.

1852
01:59:16.180 --> 01:59:19.180
He's still ripping through cigarettes.
Right?
Yeah.
I love Dave,

1853
01:59:19.181 --> 01:59:22.410
but it's like taking your Nana on the road.
He's,

1854
01:59:22.860 --> 01:59:27.670
he's cranky dude.
What was that line?
Uh,
so funny.

1855
01:59:28.270 --> 01:59:31.900
It's,
I think it's in the first episode.
I can say it right.
So please,
you're like,

1856
01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:34.290
you look like somebody who knows how to delete a hard drive.

1857
01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:38.500
[inaudible] it looks like he knows how to delete a hard drive in a hurry.

1858
01:59:38.501 --> 01:59:39.400
I think I said

1859
01:59:41.020 --> 01:59:46.020
it's a challenge coming up with insults for David Tell because he wears the same

1860
01:59:46.121 --> 01:59:47.280
thing every single show.

1861
01:59:47.830 --> 01:59:50.500
Whereas I mix it up and give him some something to work with.

1862
01:59:50.790 --> 01:59:53.770
I'll where I had a different shirt,
different shoes and coat.

1863
01:59:54.070 --> 01:59:56.170
I saw him at a show like a month ago.

1864
01:59:56.230 --> 01:59:59.410
I saw him backstage and he was wearing the same thing.
And I was like,

1865
01:59:59.411 --> 02:00:03.970
how's the manifesto coming along?
It's good.
It's good.
That's great.
Yeah.

1866
02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:08.710
He's a good guy.
He got a good heart.
Yeah.
He raises my game.
I love,

1867
02:00:08.740 --> 02:00:11.830
I love working with them.
I'm going to happen for the two of you.

1868
02:00:12.220 --> 02:00:16.960
I mean the two of you working together,
it's,
I mean I,
I tell Dave all the time.

1869
02:00:16.961 --> 02:00:20.920
One plus one is three.
You know,
we're,
we're great on our own.

1870
02:00:21.190 --> 02:00:22.540
He's the best on its own,

1871
02:00:23.050 --> 02:00:27.160
but when we come together it pops too.
Another thing,

1872
02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:31.180
it's like a band.
Yeah.
Joe Walsh join the eagles.

1873
02:00:31.270 --> 02:00:35.050
I would buy a ticket to go see the shit.
Oh that's great.

1874
02:00:35.051 --> 02:00:39.090
Keep an eye out for you coming to see you too.
I hope you guys do another.

1875
02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:42.250
Probably should have toured right when the thing came out.
We didn't,

1876
02:00:42.251 --> 02:00:46.300
we both just stopped.
We needed a break from each other.
I think,
you know what?

1877
02:00:46.540 --> 02:00:48.280
The way that Netflix specials work,

1878
02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:52.240
the biggest bump comes like nine months after.
I'm really cause it,

1879
02:00:52.250 --> 02:00:56.140
it builds and it builds and it builds and like there's people this week who are

1880
02:00:56.141 --> 02:00:58.570
discovering that's never heard of it.

1881
02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:01.780
Seeing it right now really on top of all the people that saw it before.

1882
02:01:01.781 --> 02:01:03.210
I don't think it dies down now.

1883
02:01:03.220 --> 02:01:06.460
I know when you announced these tickets they'll go way faster than they did last

1884
02:01:06.461 --> 02:01:10.140
time for sure.
That's nice to hear.
Yeah,
that'll be good.
Yeah.
You'll,

1885
02:01:10.210 --> 02:01:14.290
you'll do some added shows and markets you weren't expecting is definitely going

1886
02:01:14.291 --> 02:01:16.070
to be different,
Huh?
Yeah.

1887
02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:19.060
Even in the casino markets you think cause that was a really,

1888
02:01:19.061 --> 02:01:23.480
he won't really do that.
Theaters,
he likes to casinos.
What's the deal?

1889
02:01:23.481 --> 02:01:27.580
Why the casino they pay better.
He could smoke and the ad,
here's the other thing,

1890
02:01:27.581 --> 02:01:32.130
you'll get a raise here.
You'll get a raise in all of those.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1891
02:01:32.170 --> 02:01:35.590
So whatever you did last time it's going to go up for sure.
I love it.

1892
02:01:35.591 --> 02:01:36.100
And I've been,

1893
02:01:36.100 --> 02:01:41.100
I've been using this time away from him to work on material so that when we join

1894
02:01:41.361 --> 02:01:43.310
back up in May and June and stuff,

1895
02:01:43.610 --> 02:01:47.750
like I can bring some fire power too because he's on the road constantly.
Yeah.

1896
02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:51.350
So I've just been popping up at the comedy store and the Improv and I'm in Bray

1897
02:01:51.351 --> 02:01:55.970
in a couple of weeks like just to work on material because trying to keep up

1898
02:01:55.971 --> 02:01:58.910
with Dave,
Dave's the best comic there is right now.

1899
02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:02.780
And the fact that he lets me do these shows with him like blows my mind.

1900
02:02:02.781 --> 02:02:06.860
So the last thing I want to do is just ask him questions and be his fall guy.

1901
02:02:06.861 --> 02:02:10.550
Like I want to bring it to and have some good material and you know,

1902
02:02:10.551 --> 02:02:14.330
he gets squeamish or by talking about a political joke or you know,

1903
02:02:14.331 --> 02:02:17.590
but it forces him to then like retort with another political jokes.

1904
02:02:17.591 --> 02:02:21.830
So it's no way we have,
we challenge each other in a really interesting way.

1905
02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:25.450
<v 14>Oh you guys are just so good.
You have such good chemistry,
chemistry,</v>

1906
02:02:25.660 --> 02:02:29.530
very complimentary.
And it looks like you guys are just,
you know,

1907
02:02:29.531 --> 02:02:32.680
it's a beautiful tennis thing to watch back and forth.

1908
02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:37.210
I have a technical question.
I love your technical questions.
Fun.

1909
02:02:37.270 --> 02:02:38.920
Interesting how you guys,
so I know

1910
02:02:38.980 --> 02:02:41.490
<v 13>if only you could use this stuff on your active workout crib.</v>

1911
02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:49.270
That's roasting by listening.
Yeah,
you did it.
You did it.

1912
02:02:50.130 --> 02:02:50.963
Um

1913
02:02:52.030 --> 02:02:55.780
<v 14>Oh.
I was like,
okay.
See you.
You only have one show to tape,
right?</v>

1914
02:02:55.781 --> 02:02:59.590
You can't obviously have the same audience for two cause you were doing it in

1915
02:02:59.591 --> 02:03:00.750
clubs.
The button

1916
02:03:01.250 --> 02:03:01.491
<v 13>we did,</v>

1917
02:03:01.491 --> 02:03:05.120
we did three nights at the comedy village underground at the comedy cellar.

1918
02:03:05.121 --> 02:03:08.480
We did two shows a night.
Different obviously different audiences and all that.

1919
02:03:08.490 --> 02:03:09.800
Yeah,
mostly different.

1920
02:03:09.801 --> 02:03:14.180
We get a lot of repeats as you can imagine because there's so much improvising.

1921
02:03:14.181 --> 02:03:16.910
He's improvising that they want us,
they want to see more.

1922
02:03:17.390 --> 02:03:19.250
They just don't want to leave.
You know,

1923
02:03:19.251 --> 02:03:23.660
Paul Rudd is in the Sunday episode of bumping rights on Netflix.

1924
02:03:24.380 --> 02:03:29.380
The only reason he closes the second show with us is because he was there with

1925
02:03:29.811 --> 02:03:33.980
his wife and friends for the first show.
Loved it so much called the babysitter,

1926
02:03:33.981 --> 02:03:37.670
almost like we're staying out and stayed for a whole other show.

1927
02:03:37.671 --> 02:03:40.760
And by then I was like,
all right,
this guy's had a bunch of drinks.

1928
02:03:40.761 --> 02:03:43.880
He's here for two shows.
I'm not even going to ask him or just bringing them up.

1929
02:03:43.990 --> 02:03:47.600
Yeah.
And he's flew right out of his seat and played with us for 10 minutes.

1930
02:03:47.601 --> 02:03:49.160
So it is a night out.

1931
02:03:49.161 --> 02:03:53.600
Like we produce it by not really completely producing it.

1932
02:03:53.601 --> 02:03:58.100
We kind of put a few things out there like,
like Bruce Willis said,
hey,

1933
02:03:58.101 --> 02:04:00.710
I want to come see your show.
I said,
great.
You know,

1934
02:04:00.740 --> 02:04:05.270
take care of you and your friend.
Put him on the gas was,
I don't see him before.

1935
02:04:05.271 --> 02:04:08.960
I don't tell him I'm going to introduce him.
I wouldn't have introduced them,

1936
02:04:08.961 --> 02:04:12.020
but Dave was like,
all right,
I'll take it,
you know,

1937
02:04:12.021 --> 02:04:13.280
and he just like shouting them out.

1938
02:04:13.670 --> 02:04:18.040
So I said to myself that afternoon and Bruce Willis was coming,

1939
02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:19.640
we're shooting.
It's our first night.

1940
02:04:20.180 --> 02:04:23.540
What if something does happen where he leaps out of his chair or something does

1941
02:04:23.541 --> 02:04:27.810
happen.
I want to be prepared.
I don't really want to write the jokes about them,

1942
02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:32.860
but maybe if I had a harmonic in my back pocket just in case something cool will

1943
02:04:35.011 --> 02:04:38.550
happen.
And that's as much as take the producing of it,
like yeah.

1944
02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.090
Kind of what ifs and maybes and prepare for different things.

1945
02:04:42.091 --> 02:04:46.440
And literally Dave and I don't speak before the show.
He won't make a set list.

1946
02:04:46.441 --> 02:04:50.070
You won't block,
he won't rehearse,
just no makeup.
He,

1947
02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:53.100
he is off to street,
you know,
has a cigarette.

1948
02:04:53.101 --> 02:04:57.750
He'll say hi and we go and if I wanna like,
hey Dave,

1949
02:04:57.751 --> 02:05:02.370
we set me up for this,
this and this.
And I'm really,
oh no,
it's infuriating.

1950
02:05:02.371 --> 02:05:03.204
And sometimes,

1951
02:05:04.350 --> 02:05:08.550
and sometimes I'll set them up for a joke that he's done three nights in a row

1952
02:05:08.551 --> 02:05:10.260
and knocked out of the park and then he'll,

1953
02:05:10.420 --> 02:05:14.350
<v 0>he'll,
he'll just ignore me.
And that's infuriating.
Oh yeah.
And that's,
so,</v>

1954
02:05:14.351 --> 02:05:18.690
by the way,
it's definitely so it's repeating them because I,
I,

1955
02:05:18.930 --> 02:05:22.450
I've told this story before,
like site,
I worked with him years ago.

1956
02:05:22.570 --> 02:05:26.320
I opened for forum,
like I middled for him a few times and I was like,

1957
02:05:26.830 --> 02:05:31.160
so you know,
so geek,
this is like insomnia is on,
you know,
right.

1958
02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:35.890
Like just it's everywhere and every comic coming up you're like,
oh my God,

1959
02:05:35.891 --> 02:05:40.120
I love this guy.
Right.
He's and you know,
all the shows are packed.

1960
02:05:41.050 --> 02:05:45.910
He is fucking destroying.
Yeah.
Was Bria?

1961
02:05:46.420 --> 02:05:50.860
Yeah,
I did.
I did two years apart,
two separate weekends with him,

1962
02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:54.340
like six show weekends and like,
you know,

1963
02:05:54.520 --> 02:05:58.900
so you do your Thursday show and you're like,
holy shit in Friday,
early show,

1964
02:05:59.260 --> 02:06:01.990
you know,
let's say most of that stuff.

1965
02:06:02.530 --> 02:06:06.850
And then on the late show it's the same setup and a different punch line.

1966
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:08.940
You're like,
what the fuck did I mean?
Like,

1967
02:06:08.950 --> 02:06:13.090
and like the punchline killed and he's already like,
and then Saturday,

1968
02:06:13.990 --> 02:06:16.450
it's not the first one that killed,
it's not the second one,

1969
02:06:16.451 --> 02:06:19.120
that D it's another punchline right in there.
And I'm like,

1970
02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:22.310
<v 13>well,
he finds what he likes and then when he gets it the way he likes it,</v>

1971
02:06:22.311 --> 02:06:25.310
he never does it again.
Dates repeating himself.

1972
02:06:25.640 --> 02:06:28.440
He's not thinking about building material for a special,

1973
02:06:28.441 --> 02:06:32.390
he's just thinking about staying true to what he thinks is funny all the time.

1974
02:06:32.420 --> 02:06:35.270
All the time.
So if we happen to be shooting that weekend,

1975
02:06:35.271 --> 02:06:39.410
that's the jokes we get on tape.
That's really,
that's really how it is.
Yeah.

1976
02:06:39.590 --> 02:06:42.440
Oh my God.
He gets another half hour that he could have done,

1977
02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:45.800
but we'll also like argue about that.
I'm like,
Hey,
we got to like kill.

1978
02:06:45.801 --> 02:06:48.500
Like you've got to bring your best stuff.
And then I'll,

1979
02:06:48.620 --> 02:06:52.700
I'll set him up for a home run joke that's going to get us out of the episode

1980
02:06:52.701 --> 02:06:56.180
and he'll just ignore me.
It's infuriating.

1981
02:06:56.760 --> 02:06:59.630
<v 0>And what about when you talk to him like afterwards about it?
He's,
like I said,</v>

1982
02:06:59.631 --> 02:07:02.550
didn't feel like doing it mid.
He,
he won't even,

1983
02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:04.860
it's not even a proper question.

1984
02:07:05.400 --> 02:07:10.400
Really know that would even entertain the kid won't even know what I'm talking

1985
02:07:10.441 --> 02:07:12.550
about.
Yeah.
Wow.

1986
02:07:13.370 --> 02:07:17.450
<v 13>Yeah.
I,
if I see them afterwards,
it's about the next show.</v>

1987
02:07:17.480 --> 02:07:20.960
I don't have time to look back.
He's not engaging on that.

1988
02:07:21.390 --> 02:07:24.740
I've learned how not to fight with them and I learned that it's not me,

1989
02:07:24.741 --> 02:07:28.910
it's him and I become really patient.

1990
02:07:28.911 --> 02:07:32.750
And to be honest with you,
as much as we've been friends our whole careers,

1991
02:07:32.751 --> 02:07:33.410
Dave and I,

1992
02:07:33.410 --> 02:07:37.780
decades like I think this has us like truly how's,

1993
02:07:37.781 --> 02:07:42.500
where were we have a whole other respect for each other or,

1994
02:07:42.550 --> 02:07:47.260
and
I haven't really thought about this or talked about it too much,

1995
02:07:47.290 --> 02:07:51.520
but you know,
we had big fights going into this thing like a couple of years ago,

1996
02:07:51.521 --> 02:07:53.440
like a couple of Christmases ago when we were starting to,

1997
02:07:53.441 --> 02:07:58.300
like when I was pushing him to go to the Montreal comedy festival and let's call

1998
02:07:58.301 --> 02:08:02.230
it bumping Mike's and he didn't like that.
He didn't want to go to the festival.

1999
02:08:02.480 --> 02:08:05.200
There's no money.
He didn't want to call it bumping Mike's.

2000
02:08:05.201 --> 02:08:07.240
It was too on the nose.
He didn't want to.

2001
02:08:08.290 --> 02:08:10.720
And now we don't really fight.

2002
02:08:10.900 --> 02:08:14.830
We're sort of getting to a place where we kind of understand each other.

2003
02:08:14.950 --> 02:08:18.510
You're like an old married couple,
you and your Nana on the road.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2004
02:08:18.511 --> 02:08:22.210
You know how Nana is and I know how he is now and I don't push them on certain

2005
02:08:22.211 --> 02:08:26.680
things and he,
and he'll admit this too,
like he will,

2006
02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:27.753
um,

2007
02:08:28.390 --> 02:08:33.390
he will defer to me on other things were we would fight back about it all the

2008
02:08:33.431 --> 02:08:36.490
time,
you know,
and we're comics,
we end,

2009
02:08:36.491 --> 02:08:39.370
there's always little mood swings in here and there of course.

2010
02:08:40.060 --> 02:08:42.670
But finally one day I was like,
Dave,

2011
02:08:42.730 --> 02:08:46.930
just talk to me as nicely as you do the servers at the comedy cellar.

2012
02:08:47.470 --> 02:08:48.161
Cause he'll tips,

2013
02:08:48.161 --> 02:08:50.830
everybody brings him candy and then he'll look at me and go buy,

2014
02:08:50.850 --> 02:08:53.910
my mom would just bark at me about something.
I'm like,
no,

2015
02:08:54.590 --> 02:08:58.780
I don't need to get in to a messy marriage here,
bro.
You're like,
yeah,

2016
02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:02.560
we're to get along or we're not doing it.
You know.

2017
02:09:02.890 --> 02:09:06.670
And I'm always fascinated when two funny guys get together who don't necessarily

2018
02:09:06.671 --> 02:09:10.750
have to be together.
Right.
It's kind of fun.
Like when rappers get together,

2019
02:09:11.530 --> 02:09:15.880
I asked,
um,
there's a,
there's a musical thing called black star.

2020
02:09:15.910 --> 02:09:18.820
Talib Kweli is a rapper.
What most deaf and worse,

2021
02:09:18.850 --> 02:09:22.690
they both have solo careers and they do both do extremely well,

2022
02:09:22.691 --> 02:09:25.630
but they do the special thing together.
Blackstar.
Yeah.

2023
02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:29.770
And I asked to Lib Kweli I go,
how do you get along with most stuff?

2024
02:09:29.771 --> 02:09:34.240
Like how do you guys like work it?
And he goes,
oh,
I just do what most says.

2025
02:09:35.110 --> 02:09:40.090
I've learned that if I try to push back and,
and,
and you know,
most,
most,
you know,

2026
02:09:40.091 --> 02:09:42.550
maybe I shouldn't be saying all this on the,
on the podcast,

2027
02:09:42.551 --> 02:09:44.590
but basically he said like,
he,

2028
02:09:44.700 --> 02:09:49.690
he's learned to just sort of trust that the other guy who was kinda right.
Yeah.

2029
02:09:49.720 --> 02:09:52.510
It's going to work and yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.

2030
02:09:53.530 --> 02:09:56.470
I thought you were saying Yasiin Bey is a sovereign citizen,
so,
yeah.
Right.

2031
02:09:56.520 --> 02:09:57.353
It's going away.

2032
02:09:59.530 --> 02:10:03.130
That's my favorite thing ever is that most deaf was in Africa.
And he was like,

2033
02:10:03.230 --> 02:10:05.950
no,
I'm,
first of all,
I'm Yasiin Bey.
And then they're like,

2034
02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:08.740
you don't have a visa to be here.
And he was like,
I'm a sovereign citizen.

2035
02:10:08.770 --> 02:10:10.870
When they were like,
no,
that doesn't count.
Right.

2036
02:10:10.940 --> 02:10:13.060
You gotta get the Fuck Outta here,
man.
Yeah.
They kicked him out.

2037
02:10:13.300 --> 02:10:16.330
But those dudes are amazing together.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I've seen them together.

2038
02:10:16.390 --> 02:10:17.560
So you're saying that I'm that guy.

2039
02:10:18.290 --> 02:10:20.330
<v 14>Yeah.
I think what Jeff is saying and you know,</v>

2040
02:10:20.331 --> 02:10:25.331
in a marriage you realize there's just some fights that aren't worth having and

2041
02:10:25.641 --> 02:10:28.380
you trust and you know them and you know where you're,

2042
02:10:28.460 --> 02:10:31.910
I know or your abilities lie.
And I think you know our mind line,

2043
02:10:32.540 --> 02:10:34.060
there's just shit you don't fight about.

2044
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:37.490
<v 4>Cause you're like,
I know,
I know that Tom knows in this situation.</v>

2045
02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:41.170
Like you know what's up here.
Yeah.
You trust choices too.
Yeah.
You're like

2046
02:10:41.730 --> 02:10:45.280
<v 13>part of us doing it together.
Now we have,
you know,
Dave and I,
we met,
we got it,</v>

2047
02:10:45.310 --> 02:10:49.390
we got through it and like he,
he pushes me to like,

2048
02:10:49.391 --> 02:10:53.230
he wasn't settling on a director and everybody I brought to him,

2049
02:10:53.231 --> 02:10:57.430
he either wouldn't meet with or they were too hip or they accused them of over

2050
02:10:57.431 --> 02:11:00.160
overlighting someone else's special,
you know,

2051
02:11:00.161 --> 02:11:02.020
he would be very persnickety about it.

2052
02:11:02.021 --> 02:11:06.010
Then I would get mad because he'd be being rude to people that,
you know,

2053
02:11:06.011 --> 02:11:07.270
are very respected.

2054
02:11:07.271 --> 02:11:11.650
And so Han and he wouldn't take the meeting or it'd be an hour late or whatever,

2055
02:11:11.651 --> 02:11:15.610
you know,
that's Dave.
And then,
you know,
I brought him finally.
I was

2056
02:11:17.110 --> 02:11:22.110
lamenting all this to my pal Andrew [inaudible] who is a documentarian.

2057
02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:27.010
Yeah.
And I knew I wanted this to have a documentary feel.

2058
02:11:27.810 --> 02:11:28.340
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

2059
02:11:28.340 --> 02:11:31.400
<v 13>And Andrew and I kinda was like one in the morning.</v>

2060
02:11:31.401 --> 02:11:33.740
We were just having one of our long walks were good pals.

2061
02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:38.220
Andrew directly directed,
uh,
the jinx on Hbo.
Unbelievable.

2062
02:11:38.230 --> 02:11:40.630
About Robert Durst.
It's unbelievable.
Yeah.

2063
02:11:40.631 --> 02:11:43.760
It's a fantastic multipart documentary.

2064
02:11:43.761 --> 02:11:47.420
So you know what bumping Mike's was going to be a three part documentary.

2065
02:11:48.290 --> 02:11:49.940
Actually,
Netflix wanted it to be more,

2066
02:11:49.980 --> 02:11:53.320
they wanted it to be like four in labor yesterday.
They was like,
no,
sorry.

2067
02:11:54.890 --> 02:11:58.010
I was like,
all right,
I can make that work Friday,
Saturday,
Sunday.

2068
02:11:58.011 --> 02:12:00.470
We'll make it a weekend.
Um,
format.

2069
02:12:00.530 --> 02:12:03.200
We'll call the episodes by the night and we'll see if that works.

2070
02:12:03.201 --> 02:12:07.820
And we'll do two shows a night and we'll intercut some of our sort of offstage

2071
02:12:07.850 --> 02:12:09.980
stuff.
And Andrew,

2072
02:12:11.960 --> 02:12:12.793
<v 11>Eh,</v>

2073
02:12:13.830 --> 02:12:18.450
<v 13>Andrew,
to his credit,
even though he'd seen and I performed together many,</v>

2074
02:12:18.451 --> 02:12:22.440
many times more than anyone else.
Andrew is not a comedy director.

2075
02:12:22.441 --> 02:12:23.790
He'd never worked in comedy.

2076
02:12:23.791 --> 02:12:28.380
And I'd been telling him for the whole 15 years I had been friends with this
guy,

2077
02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:31.230
you should do comedy.
It'll add years to your life.

2078
02:12:31.260 --> 02:12:36.260
These documentaries you keep doing about child molesters and murderers are a

2079
02:12:36.271 --> 02:12:41.160
drain on you and your family.
Fucking bummer.
Yeah,
right.
He did a,

2080
02:12:41.161 --> 02:12:41.521
you know,

2081
02:12:41.521 --> 02:12:46.310
the capturing the Friedman first big time ago about child molesters,

2082
02:12:47.090 --> 02:12:49.000
child molesters.
And I got in Long Island.
Yeah.

2083
02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:53.890
<v 4>Genx I was obsessed with.
So it's so good.
And</v>

2084
02:12:54.610 --> 02:12:58.090
<v 13>Jews are very sophisticated filmmaker.</v>

2085
02:12:58.091 --> 02:13:02.670
So I knew if I set up the comedy and the situation and got the club together
and,

2086
02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:06.490
and got the act together that Andrew would make it look good and he would also

2087
02:13:06.491 --> 02:13:09.170
be able to like maybe help me with some of,

2088
02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:09.850
<v 11>yeah.</v>

2089
02:13:09.850 --> 02:13:12.700
<v 13>You know,
the friction between Dave and I.
Yeah.
And,</v>

2090
02:13:12.730 --> 02:13:15.430
but we didn't want it to be like my friends directing it.

2091
02:13:15.431 --> 02:13:20.431
So Andrew went down to the comedy cellar without me and hung out with Dave and

2092
02:13:21.611 --> 02:13:25.390
they'd known each other a little bit,
threw me over the years and suddenly this,

2093
02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:31.470
this murder documentarian and Dave were getting along well and,

2094
02:13:32.710 --> 02:13:35.850
and Dave has these little tests that I don't,
I've never talked about this,

2095
02:13:35.851 --> 02:13:40.200
but you know,
like Amy Schumer,
Big Star was about to go on,
you know,

2096
02:13:40.201 --> 02:13:40.880
and Dave said,

2097
02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:45.880
I guess you want to go down and watch Amy and Andrew saw the trap.

2098
02:13:47.230 --> 02:13:50.760
Yeah.
He's like,
no,
I love Amy but I'm here to hang with you Dave.

2099
02:13:50.970 --> 02:13:53.580
And that's what they really,
you could tell they really fell in love.

2100
02:13:53.581 --> 02:13:56.880
Andrew told me this whole story after,
you know,
and uh,

2101
02:13:56.940 --> 02:13:58.200
you guys are playing chess man.

2102
02:13:58.200 --> 02:14:01.680
And that's what we really wanted to get Dave on board with Andrew because David

2103
02:14:01.681 --> 02:14:05.850
turned down three or four other comedy directors.
Wow.
Big,

2104
02:14:05.851 --> 02:14:08.190
big names.
Who would do that?
Who wanted to do it?

2105
02:14:09.630 --> 02:14:14.460
Guys winning Emmys for these things and stuff.
They was like,
Nah,
Nah,
Nah,
two,

2106
02:14:14.500 --> 02:14:15.680
two,
two.
Yeah.

2107
02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:20.720
It's part of the lesson that you learned or what you figured out was like not to

2108
02:14:21.511 --> 02:14:23.760
be reactive to him reacting.

2109
02:14:23.761 --> 02:14:28.680
You kind of had to like take a breath and just allow him to be how he is.

2110
02:14:28.700 --> 02:14:32.460
Right.
And,
and,
and sort of not fault them for him.
And that's just who he is.

2111
02:14:32.461 --> 02:14:35.370
I have to love him for who he is and now he's starting to trust me.

2112
02:14:35.371 --> 02:14:37.980
And there were certain other things in the show and guests,

2113
02:14:37.981 --> 02:14:42.300
he didn't want that I really did force on him and he would immediately

2114
02:14:42.301 --> 02:14:44.610
afterwards say,
Yep,
you're right.
That was a good idea.

2115
02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:49.640
So I realize he was sort of the frosting a little bit themselves and you know,

2116
02:14:49.981 --> 02:14:51.120
other things I pushed him on,

2117
02:14:51.121 --> 02:14:55.050
he was adamant he didn't want to do and we didn't do it.
Yeah.
So there's a,

2118
02:14:55.051 --> 02:14:59.250
you know,
you pick your battles so to speak.
It's part of being,

2119
02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:04.200
I once asked,
I also once asked a Penn,
Penn Jillette who's in Penn and teller,

2120
02:15:05.300 --> 02:15:09.460
I said,
I said,
give me some advice,
give me some,
give me some advice.
Like,

2121
02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:12.210
how do you guys,
cause I written for a comedy team.

2122
02:15:12.211 --> 02:15:16.560
My first writing job was writing for MTV.
Read Johnny in the round,

2123
02:15:16.561 --> 02:15:20.820
guy to comics were,
this was in the 90s.
Uh,

2124
02:15:20.850 --> 02:15:24.750
John Dimaggio,
um,
uh,
from Futurama

2125
02:15:26.500 --> 02:15:30.340
was red Johnny.
And,
um,
Tim was his partner.
Um,

2126
02:15:30.810 --> 02:15:32.480
Tim Regan and,
and,

2127
02:15:33.390 --> 02:15:36.420
and I learned that they would always fight and I'd always be breaking up fights

2128
02:15:36.421 --> 02:15:39.300
between these guys.
I was like,
oh,
I can't have that with Dave.

2129
02:15:39.301 --> 02:15:41.370
And I had had these teams were,

2130
02:15:42.040 --> 02:15:45.990
and I remember Buddy Hackett telling me early on that they offered him to

2131
02:15:45.991 --> 02:15:50.100
replace one of the stooges in a movie when one of the stooges got sick.
Whoa.

2132
02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:52.980
And I needed the money.
I had just had my first kid.

2133
02:15:52.981 --> 02:15:56.400
I was still sort of a young comic,
not much of a following.

2134
02:15:56.401 --> 02:16:00.690
And I thought about it and I thought about it and I realize I don't want to wake

2135
02:16:00.691 --> 02:16:05.430
up every morning wondering how the other guy feels.
So I was like,

2136
02:16:05.590 --> 02:16:10.260
okay,
man,
now I'm in a team.
It sounds like such a bad idea.
I have the best life,

2137
02:16:10.270 --> 02:16:11.460
I'd do whatever I want now.

2138
02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:16.950
I got to like partner up and pens.
I asked pen and he's like,

2139
02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:21.510
he's like,
well no.
I go,
how does it work with you?
And tell her he goes,
well,

2140
02:16:21.511 --> 02:16:22.590
I mean,
no,

2141
02:16:23.460 --> 02:16:28.080
ours works because no other team has telled her as a partner.

2142
02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:30.250
In other words,
he loved teller

2143
02:16:30.250 --> 02:16:32.380
<v 14>and they their special thing.</v>

2144
02:16:32.381 --> 02:16:35.920
So it really is a unique look at u two.
I mean,

2145
02:16:35.921 --> 02:16:40.720
how many marriages work human married over a decade.

2146
02:16:40.810 --> 02:16:41.643
I know.

2147
02:16:42.310 --> 02:16:47.020
Most of the time these things are too,

2148
02:16:47.170 --> 02:16:51.430
they're too hot.
Where were where they're not sustainable

2149
02:16:52.540 --> 02:16:56.830
<v 15>for us though.
And this probably helps other,
uh,
duos,</v>

2150
02:16:56.920 --> 02:17:00.870
like especially the ones that only do that,
like we're not competitive things.

2151
02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:01.361
A big thing.

2152
02:17:01.361 --> 02:17:06.361
I remember talking to a couple married couples in comedy over the years who they

2153
02:17:06.461 --> 02:17:11.300
like lead with competitiveness.
Right?
I got this.
She didn't get that out of that.

2154
02:17:11.700 --> 02:17:14.820
They all their divorce.
All of them.
Yeah.

2155
02:17:15.410 --> 02:17:20.000
<v 14>I think you're totally right.
And a lot of that because we're not,</v>

2156
02:17:20.001 --> 02:17:23.480
we're not competitive because we started together and I think we did.

2157
02:17:23.630 --> 02:17:28.160
We did open mics together and we were in the trenches together for so many
years.

2158
02:17:28.190 --> 02:17:31.900
So your success is shared in a way.
Yeah.
It's like we are,

2159
02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:36.350
start a family together.
Yeah.
We're,
we're Cosby team.
Try Osby that's what we say.

2160
02:17:36.460 --> 02:17:41.060
It's from this old Cosby thing,
the word,
the word to mommy's one jeans,

2161
02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:44.360
like we share a pair.
That's just always been our mantra.

2162
02:17:44.450 --> 02:17:48.650
And truthfully what Penn said about a teller,

2163
02:17:49.010 --> 02:17:52.010
I adore him.
I fucking adore this man.

2164
02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:55.940
She always says it like the way I adore you.

2165
02:17:56.150 --> 02:18:00.140
I love your farts.
Even when you're disgusting.
Like I adore everything about you.

2166
02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:05.420
I do.
I think you're just adorable and I,
I don't know.
I will never not love him.

2167
02:18:05.470 --> 02:18:08.540
There's,
he can do no wrong.
Hmm.
I think that's part of it.

2168
02:18:08.541 --> 02:18:10.910
I'm just blinded by my affection for you.

2169
02:18:11.180 --> 02:18:15.890
That's maybe that's why I put up with Dave Shit because I am blinded by my

2170
02:18:15.891 --> 02:18:18.600
affection for them.
I really do

2171
02:18:18.800 --> 02:18:23.180
<v 15>come on stage and I feel like I'm watching a folk hero or something.
Yeah.</v>

2172
02:18:23.190 --> 02:18:27.770
He's such a good comic.
Yeah.
He really,
and,
and,
and it's from my open mic days.

2173
02:18:28.280 --> 02:18:32.180
Yeah.
Like I,
I,
he was hosting the open mics when I was beginning.

2174
02:18:32.181 --> 02:18:36.020
He was already made,
he was already a couple of years in.
Um,

2175
02:18:36.200 --> 02:18:39.740
and I was always like,
I would,
I just want to watch them.
It was like,

2176
02:18:39.741 --> 02:18:42.140
he always had the best jokes.
He always had the newest jokes.

2177
02:18:42.620 --> 02:18:46.860
He always cut through.
He always trying something different.
And I have,

2178
02:18:46.970 --> 02:18:51.350
when I podcasted with him last,
I was like,
again,
like just,
you know,

2179
02:18:51.380 --> 02:18:56.080
in awe he's looking and he's like,
do you ever blink?
Like shit like that.

2180
02:18:56.110 --> 02:19:01.050
Where was this?
I was at a crushers house.
We all pass.
Got Your podcast at the,

2181
02:19:01.060 --> 02:19:02.480
and he just,
he doesn't do many.

2182
02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:07.540
The two of us were just like a couple of kids and just smiling at him and he was

2183
02:19:08.751 --> 02:19:12.960
just making fun of us for the entire time,
you know,

2184
02:19:13.370 --> 02:19:16.100
because we were like,
remember when you said this Joe?
He's like,
yeah,
of course.

2185
02:19:16.101 --> 02:19:20.030
I fucking remember.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's so sharp.
And now that he doesn't drink,

2186
02:19:20.031 --> 02:19:21.580
he doesn't forget a thing.
He's,

2187
02:19:22.030 --> 02:19:26.210
he's very difficult to argue with because he can flip it back on you in a second

2188
02:19:26.390 --> 02:19:29.280
and mimic at the same time to just make you,
man,

2189
02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:40.070
<v 13>I thought that,
oh,
we really like,</v>

2190
02:19:40.090 --> 02:19:43.210
it wasn't my idea a year ago to ask him,
you know,
like

2191
02:19:43.780 --> 02:19:47.980
<v 15>he doesn't forget a thing.
It's too funny.
And he said,
yeah,
he really,</v>

2192
02:19:49.410 --> 02:19:53.020
uh,
Jess,
we were going to do an hour.

2193
02:19:53.330 --> 02:19:58.200
We're at 90.
Of course.
Yeah,
man.
It's like,
no,
no,
we're not.
Yeah,

2194
02:19:58.220 --> 02:20:00.600
we are.
We just did an hour and a half.
It's crazy.

2195
02:20:00.601 --> 02:20:03.700
I went by so fast and I have a sandwich in the car.
I don't even need it.

2196
02:20:03.760 --> 02:20:08.490
I never go this far without eating 90 minute crazy.
Um,

2197
02:20:09.010 --> 02:20:12.880
yeah,
dude,
thank you so much for coming.
You are the best.
So Super Fun.

2198
02:20:13.210 --> 02:20:16.310
You guys are cute.
Thank you.
I know it's upsetting

2199
02:20:17.930 --> 02:20:22.030
that we did I do as good as Danny Brown.
No,
no,
no.
He was awesome.

2200
02:20:22.290 --> 02:20:26.370
Uh,
but you know,
you got thick skin so you're,
you know,

2201
02:20:26.380 --> 02:20:29.530
you're hilarious and I'm excited to your podcasting dude.

2202
02:20:29.580 --> 02:20:31.810
I think it's going to be really great for you.
Thanks man.
I really,

2203
02:20:31.811 --> 02:20:36.740
I really find it cathartic and it's like standup,

2204
02:20:36.760 --> 02:20:38.800
I started stand up as a hobby,
as an outlet.

2205
02:20:38.800 --> 02:20:42.330
And I feel like if I keep podcasting that watch dude,
you're going to,

2206
02:20:42.340 --> 02:20:44.440
in a year you're going to be like,
oh my God,

2207
02:20:44.710 --> 02:20:47.990
you're going to be turning down shit that like you,

2208
02:20:48.110 --> 02:20:52.150
you would just because you're like,
no,
my pod,
I can't step away from

2209
02:20:53.980 --> 02:20:58.510
doing other stuff but,
but,
but how many days or week are you in here?
One here,

2210
02:20:58.511 --> 02:21:02.080
one day.
One day,
a week and a half days a week.
Do you work on the podcast?

2211
02:21:02.980 --> 02:21:06.970
We usually do like,
I mean there's things that like the way that we do,

2212
02:21:06.971 --> 02:21:09.040
cause there's multi,
you know,
we have to find these farts.

2213
02:21:09.100 --> 02:21:11.400
So there's multimedia kind of things where we're,

2214
02:21:11.401 --> 02:21:16.330
we're always like sharing in a group videos,
topics,

2215
02:21:17.320 --> 02:21:20.710
airport.
You see a guy with no head write it down,

2216
02:21:20.711 --> 02:21:22.360
you send it to the blue band.

2217
02:21:22.630 --> 02:21:27.380
Take a picture or something stupid on we're,
we're building the show.

2218
02:21:27.940 --> 02:21:32.140
I worry that at the time I'm obsessing and enjoying this essentially this hobby,

2219
02:21:32.230 --> 02:21:35.140
like the podcast right now for me,
it's like I don't play golf,

2220
02:21:35.141 --> 02:21:37.240
so I'm enjoying this podcast.

2221
02:21:37.600 --> 02:21:41.920
Eventually it's a business and that's fine too.
But I go,

2222
02:21:41.921 --> 02:21:46.200
I probably could've done a special in those days that I was Po,

2223
02:21:46.450 --> 02:21:49.660
I probably could have written a movie instead.

2224
02:21:49.661 --> 02:21:53.740
So I'm still a little bit like,
oh,
should I be doing this?

2225
02:21:53.741 --> 02:21:55.950
Is this just a crazy,
you definitely should be doing this.

2226
02:21:56.350 --> 02:22:00.190
You definitely should be because the podcast we'll fund you can into your

2227
02:22:00.191 --> 02:22:04.540
material,
come up with premise is talking to people like,
oh,
that's good.

2228
02:22:04.570 --> 02:22:07.420
And then you'll write down,
oh,
I say,
yeah,
and it's gonna.

2229
02:22:07.480 --> 02:22:11.160
It's going to totally build into your ticket sales.

2230
02:22:12.480 --> 02:22:14.550
You're gonna end up doing your,
you know,

2231
02:22:14.650 --> 02:22:17.170
some show somewhere and then all these people are going to be the like,
Oh,

2232
02:22:17.171 --> 02:22:19.960
you love the bumping mix.
And they'll be like,
no,
no,
no.

2233
02:22:19.990 --> 02:22:22.780
I'm here because of your podcast.
Like for sure.
Wow.

2234
02:22:22.781 --> 02:22:26.370
And you don't get squeamish about plugging it when you're on the road because

2235
02:22:26.371 --> 02:22:28.980
every comic has a podcast and you can feel for years.

2236
02:22:28.981 --> 02:22:33.390
I made jokes about how everyone has a podcast.
That's a joke that should be made.

2237
02:22:33.391 --> 02:22:37.680
It's an earned joke.
We all do.
But I mean,
if you're like,

2238
02:22:37.980 --> 02:22:40.890
if you enjoy doing it,
that's the thing I really truly do.

2239
02:22:41.210 --> 02:22:44.910
So like when you enjoy doing it,
it's,
you're having fun,

2240
02:22:44.970 --> 02:22:49.380
like your audience and your fans appreciate you doing something that they can

2241
02:22:49.381 --> 02:22:52.500
tell you actually like doing until this morning when I was like,

2242
02:22:52.501 --> 02:22:56.690
I want to do one this week.
And I had a text,
a couple of friends and I for,

2243
02:22:56.840 --> 02:22:59.130
for the beginning until now,

2244
02:22:59.131 --> 02:23:02.700
it was like friends and family kind of whoever was around that house.

2245
02:23:03.030 --> 02:23:04.590
And now I'm like,
hmm,
might be cool.

2246
02:23:04.600 --> 02:23:09.360
And I get a big star once in a while and then that's when I start to get really

2247
02:23:09.361 --> 02:23:13.430
like squeamish and they all want to do your podcast.
Everyone loves you.

2248
02:23:13.500 --> 02:23:15.660
Bruce Willis want to sit down,

2249
02:23:16.290 --> 02:23:20.430
fuck around with you ever roasted the one to sit down on my God.

2250
02:23:20.431 --> 02:23:23.880
Dude natural.
I got to pretend it's popular to get them on.

2251
02:23:25.230 --> 02:23:27.870
Actually no,
that's the thing is you can be like,
Hey,
I'm doing this.

2252
02:23:27.871 --> 02:23:29.640
I'm sure all of those people would be like,
yeah,

2253
02:23:29.641 --> 02:23:33.750
of course I still have a small but very loyal following like I feel like,

2254
02:23:33.780 --> 02:23:37.120
and then how much fun would it be?
Like I think if there's like a state,

2255
02:23:37.140 --> 02:23:41.550
like if there's a couple of standout roasts,
let's say,
you know,
let's say,

2256
02:23:41.551 --> 02:23:44.610
cause you've roasted Trump,
you've roasted,
I don't know,

2257
02:23:44.611 --> 02:23:48.270
let's say whatever the bean burger sure get,
get together,

2258
02:23:48.271 --> 02:23:52.350
like flavor play or the people who worked on it with you.
Oh yeah.

2259
02:23:52.351 --> 02:23:57.351
You go like member like right up to Trump roast or Bieber roast and you guys re,

2260
02:23:57.910 --> 02:24:00.810
how do you think it's okay to make it a row centric thing?

2261
02:24:00.820 --> 02:24:05.760
Like if it's not about comedy,
but it's about more worldly issues,

2262
02:24:05.761 --> 02:24:08.310
wouldn't act being in a bigger audience.
But here's the thing,

2263
02:24:08.370 --> 02:24:12.270
because like who you are,
you can jump in and out of that.

2264
02:24:12.300 --> 02:24:17.160
You can do episodes where you're like talking about what's happening in North

2265
02:24:17.160 --> 02:24:18.030
Korea with a,
you know,

2266
02:24:18.031 --> 02:24:20.180
or you have Larry Charles and you're talking about this the,

2267
02:24:20.200 --> 02:24:24.180
and it's like not really about roasting and then you do your thing at the end.

2268
02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:28.060
Sure.
But like,
because you're who you are.
It's like,
what is,

2269
02:24:28.061 --> 02:24:32.160
she did well this week we're going to talk all about the Bieber Ross because you

2270
02:24:32.161 --> 02:24:35.280
know it got 25 million viewers.
It was this,
it was that,

2271
02:24:35.281 --> 02:24:39.150
and here's people that worked on as a fan,
how it'd be like,
oh,
that's an,

2272
02:24:39.510 --> 02:24:41.910
that's an awesome one off for this week.

2273
02:24:42.270 --> 02:24:44.460
The next week you don't have to do the same thing.

2274
02:24:44.610 --> 02:24:45.870
You can the next week you could.

2275
02:24:45.871 --> 02:24:49.110
You could have Dave on and talk about how you guys were just at the same,

2276
02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:52.470
it was just on.
He came by the house and that,
that alone is just fun.

2277
02:24:53.040 --> 02:24:54.540
The other part,
which I really love,

2278
02:24:54.541 --> 02:24:58.020
which I guess you have some of it after 10 years,
you're like,
whoa,

2279
02:24:58.380 --> 02:25:00.870
but I doing it in my house,

2280
02:25:01.020 --> 02:25:04.680
I having Larry Charles in my house was such a thrill.

2281
02:25:04.740 --> 02:25:06.780
Just just the excitement of that.

2282
02:25:06.990 --> 02:25:11.730
David tell like came by and I love Dave and just having Dave like sitting in my

2283
02:25:12.300 --> 02:25:17.300
podcast studio in my house smoking cigarettes and he mentioned his dad like it

2284
02:25:17.551 --> 02:25:20.340
was very open.
Like we just posted that episode.

2285
02:25:20.341 --> 02:25:25.330
It got tons of listens and I really do enjoy having people over.

2286
02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:28.990
So then there's a part of that of like the caterer,
his son in me that's like,

2287
02:25:29.380 --> 02:25:32.500
hey Larry,
do you want something to eat?
You want to bring a buddy?
You know?

2288
02:25:32.501 --> 02:25:34.240
I kind of really love that part.

2289
02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:38.860
Then you got to embrace that could be a part of the podcast,

2290
02:25:38.910 --> 02:25:42.160
the catering,
you know what I mean?
You can have a spread for people.
Yes.

2291
02:25:42.161 --> 02:25:47.161
Today's show is sponsored by touches potatoes and all the big bar Mitzvahs in

2292
02:25:47.291 --> 02:25:51.010
the 70s that just potatoes.
That by the way,

2293
02:25:51.011 --> 02:25:55.480
for people that want to do a deep dive on.
Jeff definitely listened to his,
uh,

2294
02:25:55.540 --> 02:25:58.380
Marin episode.
That was a great one.
Oh thanks.
I think I was his age,

2295
02:25:58.600 --> 02:26:03.580
his 800th episode or something.
It's a crazy one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know,
you haven't,

2296
02:26:03.581 --> 02:26:06.670
you know,
you never think people are going to be prepared.
And then you know,
mark,

2297
02:26:06.671 --> 02:26:08.140
I know my whole career and then he's like,

2298
02:26:08.141 --> 02:26:12.640
does this amazing interview and I'm like,
yeah.
Oh okay.
Yeah.
That's nice.

2299
02:26:12.810 --> 02:26:17.260
Yeah it's it you guys.
But one thing,
it was disappointing that whole episode,

2300
02:26:17.261 --> 02:26:19.940
no far eclipse at all.
One far corner.
You know,

2301
02:26:21.070 --> 02:26:23.410
like it was really kind of a downer.

2302
02:26:23.610 --> 02:26:26.710
Just talk about what you love on your show and we love you guys.

2303
02:26:26.711 --> 02:26:28.760
Keep it light and funny.
And that's kind of fun too.

2304
02:26:30.300 --> 02:26:33.430
Like sometimes I've been doing a thing called touchy subjects where I put in

2305
02:26:33.431 --> 02:26:37.690
like the most awkward,
you know Michael Jackson documentary,
bucked us woman,

2306
02:26:37.990 --> 02:26:40.180
a woman gets eaten by her own dog.

2307
02:26:40.181 --> 02:26:43.090
Like I like doing those kind of touchy subjects,

2308
02:26:43.091 --> 02:26:46.240
what I call where we're not even talking about comedy and it's nothing.

2309
02:26:46.241 --> 02:26:50.020
You'll find out a lot of audiences love segments.

2310
02:26:50.740 --> 02:26:55.710
So you bring up touchy subjects and then there's a hot gas coming on.
Dude,

2311
02:26:55.711 --> 02:26:58.780
believe me,
the,
your fan base is listening.

2312
02:26:58.781 --> 02:27:01.310
Like I can't wait until we get to touchy subject for sure.

2313
02:27:01.810 --> 02:27:04.060
Didn't roast and peace at the end.
You get the death,

2314
02:27:04.300 --> 02:27:08.260
they want to do one it they want it had a good drug the other day about Peter

2315
02:27:08.260 --> 02:27:09.720
Torque from the monkeys.
You know,

2316
02:27:09.800 --> 02:27:14.800
he guide and I was a big fan and you know the monkey's revolutionized music

2317
02:27:15.700 --> 02:27:19.180
unless you've ever heard of the Beatles,
the stones,
pink Floyd,

2318
02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:22.120
imagine dragons,
Nelly.

2319
02:27:23.370 --> 02:27:24.203
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

2320
02:27:26.710 --> 02:27:31.380
<v 15>It's fun dealing with like the sad stuff.
It is Cathartic.
I always,</v>

2321
02:27:31.630 --> 02:27:32.600
yeah,
I agree.

2322
02:27:32.601 --> 02:27:36.720
And you have to come from a little tragedy to appreciate it to him.

2323
02:27:37.520 --> 02:27:41.000
Michael Jackson jokes.
Do you have any great ones?
Oh boy.

2324
02:27:42.710 --> 02:27:46.010
Did you roast him when he died?
I feel like you would be the master at,

2325
02:27:46.290 --> 02:27:49.130
I had a bunch of Michael Jackson jokes when he died.

2326
02:27:49.131 --> 02:27:51.950
It was like already 10 years,
right?
Yeah.

2327
02:27:52.250 --> 02:27:53.930
Isn't it crazy how it's come back around?

2328
02:27:54.110 --> 02:27:58.640
It's how like there was a time where we had like a Michael Jackson,
you know,

2329
02:27:59.060 --> 02:28:00.630
kid fucking joke or something.
Right.

2330
02:28:01.130 --> 02:28:04.520
And then if you were to hear that joke a few years ago,
you'd be like,
okay.

2331
02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:08.170
And now it's like refreshed,
like,
yeah.

2332
02:28:08.180 --> 02:28:13.010
Really because of the environment we're in.
And you know,

2333
02:28:13.310 --> 02:28:16.440
I watched it and it was a very painful show to watch and I do it,

2334
02:28:16.441 --> 02:28:17.690
but I only came twice.

2335
02:28:24.230 --> 02:28:28.220
It's hard to hold it in that whole time for so much better.

2336
02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:31.540
What the Fart or the Michael Jackson.

2337
02:28:33.310 --> 02:28:35.720
What was a bigger man?

2338

It's everywhere.
I don't have Google play.

2342
02:28:49.611 --> 02:28:51.890
I don't think you got to get on Google play.

Keep your eyes peeled for the new dates.

2345
02:28:59.721 --> 02:29:03.610
He's going to be touring with date with his Nana David towl.
Yeah,

2346
02:29:04.970 --> 02:29:08.260
we just put up the first two and then to where we started.
Great.

2347
02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:12.800
Out in Pennsylvania to do and I'm doing that next month.
That's a great place.

2348
02:29:13.910 --> 02:29:17.360
Yeah,
I did it.
Lance,
Bethlehem.
I love that place.
For some reason,

2349
02:29:17.361 --> 02:29:20.960
Dave and I always upgrade shows.
Yeah.
Flam Borgata,

2350
02:29:20.961 --> 02:29:22.700
which of course there's a layup for us.

2351
02:29:22.701 --> 02:29:26.270
That's where I'm from the area and I love it.
My family always comes.

2352
02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:30.140
I love that you,
you're the opposite of a lot of comics in that sense too,

2353
02:29:30.141 --> 02:29:32.990
where all these shows you're at,
you're like,
oh,
it's so great.

2354
02:29:32.991 --> 02:29:37.991
I can see so much family show up with like 30 people that like all crazy because

2355
02:29:39.021 --> 02:29:44.021
I'll have 25 people eating Pastrami and my green room and Dave will be alone

2356
02:29:44.480 --> 02:29:46.940
right across the hall.
And that green room smoking,

2357
02:29:47.030 --> 02:29:52.030
that's me talking to the stage manager lets me about who was there last week and

2358
02:29:52.161 --> 02:29:56.840
why they didn't sell out,
which is negative.

2359
02:29:58.870 --> 02:30:02.770
And then Dave eventually will stick his head in and you know,

2360
02:30:02.900 --> 02:30:05.390
we'll always go out afterwards.
You know,

2361
02:30:05.810 --> 02:30:08.540
it's kind of fun where he's so negative and I'm so positive.

2362
02:30:08.541 --> 02:30:10.790
And then we meet somewhere in the middle.
It's hilarious.

2363
02:30:11.150 --> 02:30:12.290
It's a great dynamic man.

2364
02:30:13.040 --> 02:30:17.930
You guys are supportive and thanks for inviting me on your podcast.

2366
02:30:22.641 --> 02:30:27.350

2368
02:30:33.801 --> 02:30:37.070
April four through six acme comedy club.
That's supposed to be a great spot.

2369
02:30:37.400 --> 02:30:41.720
It's amazing.
I'm so excited to finally go there.
I haven't been there yet,

2370
02:30:41.721 --> 02:30:44.180
but I lost my virginity to somebody who lives near there.

2371
02:30:46.150 --> 02:30:47.150
The great Lewis Lee

2372
02:30:50.600 --> 02:30:55.260
17 but it didn't have an older gent.

2373
02:30:57.680 --> 02:31:02.360
What do you want them to be?
I wasn't ready.
What?

2374
02:31:02.460 --> 02:31:05.510
How old was she?
She was just saying it was Christmas Eve.

2375
02:31:06.980 --> 02:31:10.970
Christmas Eve when I was in high school.
17 maybe.
She was 18 and I was seven.

2376
02:31:11.390 --> 02:31:13.790
I was 17 I fucking destroyed this girl.

2377
02:31:17.330 --> 02:31:20.940
That's okay.
I mean it was pound town.
She stop and maybe a hundred pounds.

2378
02:31:20.941 --> 02:31:25.680
I was two 45 yeah.
Is this your Dalmatian girlfriend?
This girl,

2379
02:31:27.560 --> 02:31:32.460
she barely spoke English.
She was my God exchange student.
Costa Rica.
Oh,

2380
02:31:32.510 --> 02:31:35.480
stop.
It was weird if she spoke English until you fucked her

2381
02:31:37.860 --> 02:31:41.450
brains.
Do you still talk to your first love makings?

2382
02:31:42.950 --> 02:31:47.100
No.
I did see her when I was in did a show in Minnesota.

2383
02:31:47.810 --> 02:31:49.410
Oh a while back.

2384
02:31:49.440 --> 02:31:53.160
She came to the show and I brought her on stage and we both sat Indian style on

2385
02:31:53.161 --> 02:31:57.240
the stage and told the story,
which was really fun.
It was beautiful.

2386
02:31:57.241 --> 02:31:59.760
You're going to have a great memorial men when you go,

2387
02:32:00.060 --> 02:32:03.830
it's going to be something better than Brody's I think so.
It was really hard.

2388
02:32:03.831 --> 02:32:08.020
You know Bradley Cooper was there.
Dude,
I know.
That was pretty big deal.
Phillips.

2389
02:32:08.820 --> 02:32:11.570
Ron White.
That was crazy.
It was crazy.
No,

2390
02:32:11.580 --> 02:32:14.720
I think you're going to have a great outpouring of love.
Yeah.

2391
02:32:14.990 --> 02:32:18.240
You got a lot of friends who said you're positive.

2392
02:32:18.280 --> 02:32:23.280
You invite people to your home.
Tom and I never do that out of our house,

2393
02:32:23.281 --> 02:32:25.950
but like we got this because we were like,
yeah,

2394
02:32:25.990 --> 02:32:29.760
I have stop having people over at the house.
We have two small children.

2395
02:32:29.820 --> 02:32:33.000
I understand that.
What are they doing right now looking for fart videos,

2396
02:32:33.070 --> 02:32:36.300
like child labor?
Probably.
Well,

2397
02:32:36.301 --> 02:32:41.300
I just taught our three year old to say I took a dump and well,

2398
02:32:41.400 --> 02:32:43.080
I'm like,
I've kind of,
I'm like,
it's funny,

2399
02:32:43.530 --> 02:32:46.950
but it's like he's saying it and I'm picturing him,
you know,

2400
02:32:47.130 --> 02:32:50.940
with other teachers and parents and he's like,
I got a dump.
And I'm like,

2401
02:32:51.650 --> 02:32:54.840
all right,
damn isn't a bad word.
What is it?
Fine.

2402
02:32:55.470 --> 02:33:00.060
Maybe there's other things he can learn first.
Like what?
Like I love you mommy.

2403
02:33:00.490 --> 02:33:04.090
He's,
he says we've got to me first thing he said,

2404
02:33:05.820 --> 02:33:10.620
yeah,
he says other stuff,
but I like take it down.
I just think it's funny.
Yeah,

2405
02:33:12.010 --> 02:33:15.930
it's funny.
Dumping is great.
I'm actually,
it's funny,

2406
02:33:15.931 --> 02:33:17.820
like last thing,
like,
you know,

2407
02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:22.560
talking about when we're talking about my jail shows and roasting and working on

2408
02:33:22.561 --> 02:33:26.820
the border and doing stuff that has heart and maybe some meaning and a mission

2409
02:33:26.821 --> 02:33:27.600
to it.

2410
02:33:27.600 --> 02:33:32.600
And then I've been working out jokes locally and they're all about shitting and

2411
02:33:32.701 --> 02:33:35.790
farting and dogs and it's like,

2412
02:33:36.150 --> 02:33:40.560
it's like I this crazy journey just to go right back to the first act I ever
did.

2413
02:33:40.561 --> 02:33:44.870
Of course.
Yeah.
It really all comes back.
It really is.

2414
02:33:44.930 --> 02:33:46.140
It gave me the license.

2415
02:33:46.330 --> 02:33:50.820
We've always just talking about how much we would love that.
I'm Carlin,
who was,

2416
02:33:50.821 --> 02:33:52.650
you know,
such a brilliant guy.

2417
02:33:52.800 --> 02:33:57.800
And we'd dive into these topics and break it down and you would just be so blown

2418
02:33:57.841 --> 02:33:58.920
away by his intellect.

2419
02:33:58.950 --> 02:34:03.420
And then after one of those incredibly well constructed bits,

2420
02:34:03.470 --> 02:34:07.620
it would be fart jokes and then you'd go back to something.
It's so loud.

2421
02:34:08.860 --> 02:34:13.860
You know who hates forced the most midgets they live when I site

2422
02:34:15.420 --> 02:34:16.930
Buddy Hackett roast and peace.
