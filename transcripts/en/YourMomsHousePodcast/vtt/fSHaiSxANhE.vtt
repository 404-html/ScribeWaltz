00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.520
How dare you breathing made that for you.

13
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.950
I ordered it on Amazon using our banner.
Your mom's.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.850

Thank you for coming out tonight.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.373

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.740
<v 0>you gotta make sure this thing,
stop it.
Hi Guys,
this is so exciting.</v>

17
00:02:14.741 --> 00:02:18.710
A Sunday night.
Holy Shit Man.

18
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.570
You don't give a fuck about your lives is awesome.

19
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.740
Snacks,
amount of fame.
All right.
Yeah,
you got it.
You ordered.

20
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.720
I have not seen this.
I,
this was not a set up.
She was like,

21
00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:36.520
I have a surprise for you.
And then

22
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.330
she came out with a fucking nerd hat.
Fucking water nerd.

23
00:02:43.331 --> 00:02:47.050
That's what you are chief of the water nerves.
Look at you.

24
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.790
Those little bottles of too much for you to handle it.

25
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.790
How dare you look at you dehydrating with coffee right now.
But then I drank yet,

26
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.770
lady,
you're terrible.
You need to get fucking life.

27
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.360
<v 2>So this is so exciting.
I can't handle a,
by the way,</v>

28
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:07.600
how many of you read the early taping?
A early shot.
Wow.

29
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.370
Diehard moms die hard wall to wall mart really to get your life now.

30
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.400
You bet it gets your life now.
Um,

31
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.180
<v 3>no,
we had a lot of fun at that show.</v>

32
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.810
We explored some interesting topics,

33
00:03:24.811 --> 00:03:28.800
but we have many more non binary topics,
very nonbinary topics.

34
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.320
<v 2>You know what's so interesting about the non binary thing is that we thought</v>

35
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:35.200
we'd get a lot of push back on the last episode,
you know,

36
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.370
so we've been asking people,
you know,
hey,
hi.
How are you?
What's your name?

37
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:44.310
What's your pronouns?
So
the idea

38
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.880
<v 3>conversations that way is insanity.
Yeah.
They,
you should meet people and be like,</v>

39
00:03:50.881 --> 00:03:55.250
hey,
hey,
hey.
Hi.
What's your name?
What's your Pronoun that you would do?

40
00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:58.860
<v 2>Well,
seven,</v>

41
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.170
<v 3>10 people will be like,
I'm going to punch you in the fucking face.</v>

42
00:04:01.171 --> 00:04:02.004
If you ever asking me that.

43
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.430
<v 2>Did we have two responses?
Yeah,
no,
we actually had some people like,</v>

44
00:04:08.431 --> 00:04:12.460
I'm nonbinary I'd love to talk about it,
but I'm saying usually we offend some.

45
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.640
<v 3>Yeah,
we get hate mail every week and this,
you know,</v>

46
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.920
it goes out to like,
there's well over half a million people every week.

47
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.950
And this question of trying to get some non binaries has led to two fucking

48
00:04:29.451 --> 00:04:29.590
yeah.

49
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.140
<v 2>Responses.
No begging.</v>

50
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.601
<v 3>We're like,</v>

51
00:04:32.601 --> 00:04:37.520
please bring your nonbinary as to our life.

52
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.383
And they were like,
hmm.

53
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.860
<v 4>Okay.</v>

54
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.800
<v 2>We'll see.
We'll,
we'll,
we'll investigate.
I'll have them on.
That's deep bro.</v>

55
00:04:42.801 --> 00:04:46.100
And we'll see if it's,
yeah.
You know,
you're going to be sincere with them.

56
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.640
Have to be,
you have to be.
Yeah.
You can't be like,
yeah,
you fucking nerd.
Well,

57
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.330
if we,
if we brought them on your mom's house,

58
00:04:53.331 --> 00:04:56.000
that is how will we would be a little weed shit on them a little.

59
00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.990
I don't want to do that.
No,
I'm not hurtful.
Like you don't have hate in my heart.

60
00:04:59.991 --> 00:05:00.824
Like,
yeah.

61
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.100
<v 4>Okay.</v>

62
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.550
<v 2>I also make some art.
Give it up for the songs beforehand.
Oh yeah.</v>

63
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.940
This guy and there's so much.
Um,

64
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.920
<v 3>yeah,
that was a Dj Dad mouth exclusive.
There's so much,
um,</v>

65
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.300
that has,
that has,
you know,

66
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.250
been put together for not only the live shows that you're at right now,
but the,

67
00:05:25.251 --> 00:05:30.251
the studio shows and we want to actually acknowledge this is something that's

68
00:05:30.561 --> 00:05:31.520
never been done before.

69
00:05:31.521 --> 00:05:34.490
We teased it that we said we were going to do it on some shows.

70
00:05:34.491 --> 00:05:35.390
It never happened.

71
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.720
But we have an opportunity tonight at this show to actually introduce you to

72
00:05:41.511 --> 00:05:42.350
blue band,

73
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.710
the Eagle and producer of our show who goes through the emails.

74
00:05:48.921 --> 00:05:52.460
He,

He makes those clips,
you know,

75
00:05:52.461 --> 00:05:53.950

<v 2>panties.
Oh,

77
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.080
<v 0>Blue Band has put his little claws on.
You know he's done it.
You know,</v>

78
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.660
that's blue band

79
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.770
blue band right there.

80
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.960
So how about you put your hands together for our producer?

81
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:19.810
The one and only blue band.
Let them

82
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.310
there is you can't do it.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.500
You'll a mother fucker.
Yo.
Areas guys.
All right.

84
00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:37.700
Blue Band.
A little band.

85
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.770
<v 3>Um,
have you enjoyed working on this show?
Yeah,
it's been a fun job.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

86
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.470
Where do you sleep at night?
In a nest.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

87
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.470
There's a little bits of yarn I find along the day.
Yeah.

88
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.630
I sleep in that cause people will send to our po box.

89
00:06:53.631 --> 00:06:57.950
People send like a little bird feed and they go give it to Blue Ben.
Yeah.

90
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.550
Thanks for that.
It's real tasty.
But you're,
you do a great job.

91
00:07:01.551 --> 00:07:02.384
Thank you very much.

92
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.480
<v 0>Is that what you pictured now?
What is it?
Bird?</v>

93
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.860
The bird.
More like a different looking Jew.

94
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.600
Yeah.
Yeah.

95
00:07:21.601 --> 00:07:23.490
You don't think blue band looks Jewish enough?

96
00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:28.890
Are you fucking shitting me right now?
Do you want a second viewing

97
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.870
<v 3>cheeses?
They Super Jewy maybe.
Is it the red hair?
Yeah,</v>

98
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:40.620
it throws you off.
Yeah.
But Ari,
Ari,
Ari is Julie.
Julie.

99
00:07:40.621 --> 00:07:42.450
Yeah.
Oh,
he's like offensively Jewish.

100
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.020
<v 0>Yes.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

101
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.280
<v 3>He washed on the bed,
but they're fucker.
Dad.
Has he still a Welsh on it or is it,</v>

102
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.060
you know what he did?
So if you don't know,
um,
you know,

103
00:07:55.061 --> 00:07:56.980
we had this bad going,
uh,

104
00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:02.390
Bart and Bart burnt and I had a bet going and are you supposed to pay up?

105
00:08:02.771 --> 00:08:07.600
But he was
then and then he was like,
no,
he's not paying.

106
00:08:07.601 --> 00:08:09.910
And we're like,
all right,
whatever.
You fucking asshole.

107
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.090
And then he wrote us this long email where he was like,

108
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.120
I'm just happy you guys are alive and you're going to be in my voice really.

109
00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:22.930
Well,
I can't mumble as much yet,

110
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:27.790
but he said that like now we're going to live longer because we lost the weight

111
00:08:27.791 --> 00:08:30.700
and he's like,
I'm taking my dad to Romania this year.

112
00:08:30.701 --> 00:08:33.400
I wouldn't be able to do that if he was obese.
Okay.

113
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:35.770
<v 0>Why is he taking his</v>

114
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:39.400
<v 3>dad's a Romanian?
No,
he's not his hair.</v>

115
00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:44.450
His Dad was a kid in a village there before the Holocaust or some shit and he

116
00:08:45.251 --> 00:08:48.240
was,
he,
it's Ari.
You understand Ra,
who's going on what?

117
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.010
You're going to die next week?
Like that's how he texts you every day.

118
00:08:51.011 --> 00:08:51.910
And then now he's like,

119
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.100
my dad will see it because he's not obese and now you guys might live

120
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.460
<v 2>that long to now that he's writing shit like that,
it's fucking weird.</v>

121
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:04.490
My favorite is that the bat was for you guys to become declared just overweight.

122
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.240
Yeah.
That's the bed that he made.

123
00:09:09.241 --> 00:09:14.241
I bet she overweight just to be overweight and not declared obese.

124
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.593
<v 4>Okay.</v>

125
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:27.770
<v 2>That was his whole bed is a miracle.
Give it up for my husband for losing five.</v>

126
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.850
At least.

127
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:36.310
I'm
only overweight.

128
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:42.340
It's just like the guys,
just like the guys.
You ever marry your mom?
Uh,
you know,

129
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.230
really
it's the most,

130
00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:47.970
we actually found somebody who had the first,

131
00:09:47.971 --> 00:09:52.020
we found another news story where a lady married not just her son,

132
00:09:52.021 --> 00:09:55.620
but her daughter too.
That's the right response.

133
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.940
A woman married her son had the marriage annulled.

134
00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.360
I didn't even know that.
You'd need to go through that,
but,
and then she's like,

135
00:10:06.361 --> 00:10:07.620
oh,
Mary,
my daughter now,

136
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.220
so you're not going to let me marry my son or my daughter.

137
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.910
And that's what she did.
She married?
Yeah,
I married her son and her daughter.

138
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.580
Would you do that?
Would you marry your son?

139
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:23.310
Of course they come out of your vagina.
Which Mary would you marry?

140
00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:27.660
Your Dad
know why

141
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.630
he's cool.
If I had married my mom or my dad,

142
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.040
definitely my dad.
My mom was cool.
Yeah,

143
00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:41.640
definitely marry my dad to marry your dad over your mom fucking a hundred times.

144
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:42.474
Yeah.

145
00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:48.210
Well you and your dad are like two peas in a pod buddy.
Yeah.

146
00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.400
It'd be gross to kiss him and stuff,
but I still would.

147
00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:56.830
He's got major dad mouth know.

148
00:10:56.831 --> 00:11:00.880
It's funny because we were talking about,
um,
if I would ever date your dad,

149
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:03.693
mom,

150
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:10.870
we were laying in bed and we're like,
oh,
would you ever date my dad?

151
00:11:10.871 --> 00:11:13.990
Like if I die?
And I was like,
you know what kind of,

152
00:11:13.991 --> 00:11:17.920
because top dog is you in the future.

153
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.640
I know,
I know exactly what I'm going to be like in 30 years.

154
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.823
But,

155
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:32.170
but the only caveat is that I don't want to touch is pener and I don't want to

156
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.860
kiss his mouth because the mouth is bad.
You wouldn't,

157
00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.500
you wouldn't blow my dad now.

158
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.560
He'd be so nice to you.

159
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.970
You don't have to,
it doesn't have to be an enthusiastic blowjob.

160
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:55.420
You have to be like,
oh,
just give him a little,
like a plop like,

161
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.560
well,
like I plop it in there,
he'd be done in few seconds,
it'd be great.

162
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.780
Yeah.
Are you done?

163
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.633
Yeah,

164
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:12.250
there's no way he could last long with you.
Nasty.

165
00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:15.670
I'm considering this because he's an old guy though.

166
00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:19.780
Do you have to factor in the age?
Is he able to get hard?
Yeah.

167
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.200
And don't ask me how I know,
but yeah.

168
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:30.020
Have you seen your dad with the interaction?
No,

169
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:34.520
but we've talked about it and I'm serious.
What does he say?
Because he's like,

170
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.430
I'm my,
my buddies,
my pals,

171
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:42.120
he take pills I hate takes by arc as a friend that hasn't it,

172
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:46.450
it takes an a direct injection into his dick.
No.
Yeah,

173
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:50.350
you can do that.
Yeah.
This guy needs it apparently.
And I didn't know you,

174
00:12:50.351 --> 00:12:54.970
you injected it in scars in her eighties and he does a direct injection and I

175
00:12:54.971 --> 00:12:59.410
was like,
I just asked cause it,
cause it was the topic.
I go,
oh wow.
Like you know,

176
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.060
is that something you're looking at it and he's like,

177
00:13:01.061 --> 00:13:05.060
I got buffalo blood in me or some shit like that and some butter,

178
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.770
some gray.
I was like,
what?
And he's like,
no problems there buddy.
And I was like,

179
00:13:08.771 --> 00:13:11.800
all right.
So,
Okay Dad.

180
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:16.810
But his balls are very hanky
now.

181
00:13:16.811 --> 00:13:19.770
How do you actually,
you have seen as well I've seen his balls.
Yeah,

182
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:25.060
on a cruise two years ago.
But you were in his cabin.
In all fairness.

183
00:13:25.061 --> 00:13:30.061
I was in his domain and he was laying in his boxers and he likes to wear them

184
00:13:31.451 --> 00:13:36.070
paper thin.
They just,
they're just down to the tissue,

185
00:13:36.071 --> 00:13:40.420
you know there are so warm.
Yeah.
They were like 30 year old boxes.
Yes.

186
00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:46.930
Throwing stones because those are probably the most comfortable boxers any human

187
00:13:46.931 --> 00:13:51.910
could ever wear.
And he was laying on his back and he was,

188
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:55.780
and I was sitting at the foot of the bed and both words.
She wasn't just like,

189
00:13:55.781 --> 00:14:00.330
I'm here for you.
We were in there together visiting with my,

190
00:14:00.331 --> 00:14:02.440
it's a vacation and you're like,
Hey dad,
what are you doing?
You know,

191
00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:03.220
like hanging out.

192
00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:08.220
And so I'm sitting in the chair and he's whatever on the bed and he flips over

193
00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.030
and the blankets like kicked off of him and he swings his leg.

194
00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:18.730
Yeah,
I Cambo and his nuts.
Just poop.

195
00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:23.080
And I did the thing that probably most of you would do,

196
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:27.230
it's like your wife's in the room and you see your dad.
I go,
Hey dad,

197
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:31.950
can you cover your balls real quick?
Right.
Not because,
I mean I wouldn't do,

198
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.590
but it's like,
it's,
it's your daughter in law,
but I've seen so many balls.

199
00:14:35.591 --> 00:14:39.940
It doesn't matter what his reaction was.
He goes,
ah,
come on,
autonomy

200
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:47.800
sound like your mother.
And I'm like,

201
00:14:47.801 --> 00:14:49.270
what are you talking about man?

202
00:14:49.271 --> 00:14:52.370
Like I'm not telling you like don't eat that me saying

203
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.710
<v 0>will you cover your balls right now?</v>

204
00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:00.800
And he insisted on not and he's like,
yeah,
but being a baby.

205
00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:05.750
<v 2>But I feel like that's such a dad thing because my dad too,</v>

206
00:15:05.751 --> 00:15:08.300
I remember in the 80s would wear those short shorts,

207
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.910
like new magical Johnson would.
Where are those

208
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.430
<v 0>magic Johnson</v>

209
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:20.230
and dude,
you guest hosting sports center is my dream.
Like that would be,

210
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:24.610
they're going to call any minute now.
Amazing thing.
Magical Johnson.

211
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:30.070
So,
but you know what I'm talking magical throws the ball.

212
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:36.980
<v 2>So I remember they would wear those short shorts in the 80s and my dad used to</v>

213
00:15:36.981 --> 00:15:39.170
wear those and I remember he would sit with,

214
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.300
you know how guys crossed their legs one leg over and I'm,

215
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:46.310
his knots would pop out all the time.
I feel like that's what dads do.

216
00:15:46.311 --> 00:15:49.880
They just show you their balls.
Well,
at a certain point.

217
00:15:49.881 --> 00:15:54.290
So I mean like I understand you do it to Ellis all the time.
I don't go like,
Hey,

218
00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:54.700
look at my,

219
00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:55.533
<v 0>Oh yeah,</v>

220
00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.880
<v 2>no,
but you walk around in your boxers.
Yeah,
of course.
I'm at home.</v>

221
00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.980
I don't give a shit.
Right.
That's it.
That's what I'm saying.

222
00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:05.000
That's a good dad thing.
That thing you're like,
yeah,
yeah.
Get used to it.

223
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:08.610
They're my balls.
Yeah.
My,
my dad's though.
You're right.
I mean,

224
00:16:08.611 --> 00:16:10.110
I think it's partly with age too,

225
00:16:10.111 --> 00:16:15.111
but I've seen him fucking like I've come into his bedroom where he just got out

226
00:16:16.651 --> 00:16:17.484
of the shower and he's like,

227
00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:22.490
hey buddy walks by and I see him like walk past me,

228
00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:28.080
throw his towel down,
grab underwear,

229
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.440
and as he bends over to put them on,
I'm like,
oh my God,

230
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:36.470
<v 0>God.
Like it looks like a wild hog.
If you ever seen yes.</v>

231
00:16:36.471 --> 00:16:41.120
Here.
Yes.
Sorry.
They're like big those giant garlic cloves.

232
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.590
Yeah,
like real ball bus at the end.
And it's weird to be like,

233
00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:50.600
that's where I came from.
That's my first house.
It was right there.

234
00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:54.920
Yep.
Yeah.
Yes.

235
00:16:55.790 --> 00:17:00.440
And then your dad just in your mind.
No,
I remember the story.

236
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:05.390
I remember.
Yeah,
my buddy.
So

237
00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:09.680
you think that's his finishing line by

238
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:16.730
your mom?
What do you think he says?
I don't,
I don't,
I don't know.

239
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:19.290
We can change topics now and that's,

240
00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.150
it actually is probably something like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

241
00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:27.300
What do you think your dad's is Gerald

242
00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:32.020
<v 2>got it gets up real quick.
You know how he gets up after a meal super fast.</v>

243
00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:36.750
<v 0>I'm done.
Yeah.
Oh,
that's definitely,
yeah,
so he probably like,
no,</v>

244
00:17:36.751 --> 00:17:41.580
my mom is,
my mind has actually confirmed that she goes there with you.

245
00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:46.590
The father is like Mia because,
because he's been,

246
00:17:46.591 --> 00:17:50.730
he's like,
I'm gonna take a shower,
my bay play.
He gets up immediately.

247
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:58.050
<v 5>No,
we do it.
And then you say get out.</v>

248
00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:58.973
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

249
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.500
get out as my closing line and I recommend it.
It's a fun thing to do.

250
00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:09.060
Try it with your spouse or girlfriend or whatever.
Right.
If you're the girl,

251
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:10.110
that was even better.

252
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:16.440
Imagine what a mind fuck you would do to most guys if like,
he's like,
oh,

253
00:18:16.441 --> 00:18:21.030
and then you go get out and he's like,
I think I'm in love.

254
00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.390
You're like fucking like you dude.

255
00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:28.500
But then,
but guys would love that.

256
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:33.680
Do it to a guy you really like and not come back.
I love it.

257
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.460
Oh my God,
please.
I would have been hooked immediately on that

258
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:45.060
attitude problem,
but just like the,
you came over

259
00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.930
<v 5>and we did it and I basically was like,
get the fuck out of here.</v>

260
00:18:49.931 --> 00:18:52.930
And then you're like,
can I come over tomorrow?
Can I see you again,
girl.

261
00:18:52.931 --> 00:18:54.640
What's your number girl?
You're in my head.

262
00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:59.490
<v 0>He's all like the gays.</v>

263
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:04.260
<v 5>You were telling like that with me.
Like I was not like,
girl,</v>

264
00:19:04.261 --> 00:19:05.510
you're in my heart for real.

265
00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:10.440
<v 0>Oh
yes,
no,
I was like,</v>

266
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:12.183
anyways,

267
00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:17.460
<v 5>you are not.
You are,
you just loved me.
What?
Yeah,</v>

268
00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:20.990
that's cause I was mean to you.
I was a little dismissive.
I was cold.

269
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.450
But you know why?
Because my heart had been broken.
I was,

270
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:28.090
I was mending a broken heart and I wasn't no fucking dude.

271
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:30.330
I don't want to get married.
I don't want no kids.
Fuck this.

272
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:31.560
And then you are like,

273
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:33.750
<v 0>you just loved it.</v>

274
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:39.150
But it was perfect because the girl I dated before you was a total Dalmatian,

275
00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.153
so I was,

276
00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.980
<v 5>well,
you've been saying that in private a Dalmatian.
Yeah.
That's good.</v>

277
00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:52.720
We haven't had on the show yet.
I know they're super,
yeah.
Dopey.
Right?

278
00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:57.180
Like a Maltese or a,
yeah.
Malteses are dumber.

279
00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.713
Hi.

280
00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:01.720
<v 0>Like Schnitzel.
Yeah.</v>

281
00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:05.220
<v 5>But anyway,
so you were dating a Dalmatian</v>

282
00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.830
and I love what you told me about this the other day we've been talking about,

283
00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:15.570
no,
she used to like as a like as a treat.

284
00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:20.890
Like it was supposed to be exciting.
She had straight hair.
Right?
Like,
like,

285
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:25.940
like Christina has straight hair but like on black knight curls but like

286
00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.460
childlike curls were

287
00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:34.890
<v 0>and she'd be like,
I curled it and she's like,
do you like it?
I'll be like,</v>

288
00:20:34.891 --> 00:20:38.430
you looked like Shirley temple right now.
Like do I like it?
No,

289
00:20:38.431 --> 00:20:41.010
I don't want to fucking eight year old.
What are you talking about?
Like,

290
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:44.460
you know what I mean?
Like it was like a,
it was a childlike looking.
She's like,

291
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:48.190
I did it in front of you.
I'd be like,
you can undo

292
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.890
<v 2>it for me too,
cause I don't like it at all.
Brush that shit out.</v>

293
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:54.820
The worst is I had to pretend I'd be like,
oh you did the fucking curls again.

294
00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:59.740
That's awesome.
Like
she would do like those tendrils,
right?
Yeah.

295
00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.800
Like southern bell.
That's a fucking great.

296
00:21:02.801 --> 00:21:06.910
But like it was like an attempt to do like that Farrah Fawcett seventies look.

297
00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:10.840
Yep.
Yep,
Yep.
You're all curls.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But it wasn't,
it was just like,

298
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.980
I'm a good girl right now.

299
00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:18.760
Like it did she put bows in it too?
She was almost there.
Yeah.

300
00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:23.470
Yeah.
What do you get your dog back from the groomer.
Yeah.

301
00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:29.100
Yeah.
And you're like,
especially when they do it to your mail and you're like,

302
00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:34.600
do you think he wants that bone?
They do it to fifa all the time.
I'm like,

303
00:21:34.601 --> 00:21:37.640
quick queer.
And I'm like,
fucking non-binary stopped doing that.

304
00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.140
He hasn't chosen his gender yet.
Wow.

305
00:21:41.141 --> 00:21:44.750
Him Ask him his pro bono as as it.

306
00:21:44.751 --> 00:21:49.650
It's Zimmer Pronouns Jesus.
That's

307
00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.230
tendrils.
And so

308
00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:59.660
<v 5>pretend like you,
isn't that funny when you're dating somebody,
you just,</v>

309
00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:03.350
you have to let some of the small stuff slide.

310
00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.890
If you're not marrying a person,
you know,
we're in that,
I'm trying to think.

311
00:22:06.891 --> 00:22:08.270
I told you,
you guys,
you've heard this one,

312
00:22:08.271 --> 00:22:13.130
but I had a guy I was dating when I worked at Starbucks and the summer of 19,

313
00:22:13.131 --> 00:22:13.920
whatever,

314
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:18.510
<v 2>and he had,
this guy was,</v>

315
00:22:18.511 --> 00:22:20.220
he was a sweet guy.
He still lived at home.

316
00:22:20.221 --> 00:22:23.420
He was like 25 [inaudible] stupid spells

317
00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:26.773
and um,

318
00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:32.850
he got a tattoo of the band rocket from the crypt

319
00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:39.300
because you can't get into a mass white shit to me right now.

320
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:44.530
Oh,
okay.
Blackie
real cool name to give me whatever.

321
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.110
I don't,
I couldn't think of the word that was more politically correct.
Right.

322
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:53.250
So he had a rocket from the crypt tattoo so that he could get into all their

323
00:22:53.251 --> 00:22:56.760
shows for free.
That's so fucking lame.
I know.

324
00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.590
I was like all your other kind of alluded to

325
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.970
<v 3>me about that lame ass bullshit.</v>

326
00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:05.370
And then I looked it up and then I found out I read an article.
Yeah.

327
00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.930
So all they're die hard fans did that.

328
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:12.460
And then I guess they went away for awhile and then they had a comeback tour,

329
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:17.350
but the comeback tours like your die hard fans.
So they all had that tattoo.

330
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:19.830
And they were like,
yeah,
that,
that's no good anymore.
We're not doing

331
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.360
<v 2>pause.
So all these people that got it tattooed,</v>

332
00:23:24.361 --> 00:23:26.150
he could not benefit from it anymore.

333
00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:27.950
<v 5>That's terrible.
Yeah.</v>

334
00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:32.450
That's like when I was on road rules and we all got tattoos and then shut up.

335
00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:36.410
I have a tea,
I have a drum.
It's so embarrassing.
It's terrible.

336
00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.840
It's fucking dog shit.
But one of the guys,

337
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:44.350
one of the guys on on my show got a tattoo of the road rule symbol on ankle.

338
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.230
<v 0>I know he regrets it.
Now he's got like a family and kids.</v>

339
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.630
Did he change it to something else?
No,
it's still you can do.

340
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:55.910
You should tell him that's an option.
You can change it.

341
00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:01.070
I know he could make a flower.
Do anything.
Anything else?
Yeah,

342
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:06.340
we haven't done a proper show.
Open one,

343
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:11.030
right?
So first of all,
this is the late show

344
00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.390
<v 4>out of your minds.
Thank you for coming out.</v>

345
00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:22.540
<v 0>As always,
here's a clip to get us started and the opening of our show.</v>

346
00:24:22.541 --> 00:24:23.374
Here we go.

347
00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.760
<v 6>Just drizzle in some of the included moist water based lubricant.</v>

348
00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:31.510
Slide yourself in and you're ready to drill her like an oil rig.

349
00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:43.550
<v 1>Well,
welcome to your mom's house.</v>

350
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:27.930
That's my favorite.
It's

351
00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:30.390
<v 0>always like two guys in the band that catch each other.
No,</v>

352
00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:38.910
I feel anything that's such a white guy thing that's an old white guy.

353
00:25:38.911 --> 00:25:40.350
Really Black.
He tells about it.

354
00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:47.700
Blackie,
Jesus,
I don't know has past my bedtime.

355
00:25:47.701 --> 00:25:51.900
I'm usually asleep by now.
You actually really are pushing every night.

356
00:25:51.901 --> 00:25:54.940
He 89
yeah.

357
00:25:55.770 --> 00:26:00.300
I have to turn the TV volume down now.
Well like,
yeah,
it's too loud.

358
00:26:00.301 --> 00:26:04.170
I can't sleep.
He used to always be like,
turn the TV on,
watch something,

359
00:26:04.171 --> 00:26:05.610
watch something.
And I'd be like,
all right,

360
00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.420
this lab,

361
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.460
that's how fucking close your eyes.
This is what you sound like.
And you tend to

362
00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:21.480
see,
they think it's you.

363
00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.520
Why do I talk like a homeless person with no,
no,
no.
Why do you talk like that?

364
00:26:26.521 --> 00:26:27.354
And I don't know.

365
00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:35.270
I asked them.
Mary mom.
Yeah.
Yeah,

366
00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:40.860
that's,
that's dumb.
That's hair.

367
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.010
Do you like that one juice?
Why

368
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.600
<v 2>is he saying Jews?
I don't understand.
He's improvising.</v>

369
00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.000
So it's a,

370
00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:55.030
it's a scene where a lady actor squirting into a guy's face and it's like

371
00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:59.730
showering.
So he goes to juice.

372
00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:08.310
He's improvising but a squirt considered juice.
No,
it's not.

373
00:27:08.311 --> 00:27:11.240
But imagine you're in the moment.
Say something.
Yeah,

374
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:18.810
he could've,
he could've said anything like coffee,
whatever.
He said.

375
00:27:18.811 --> 00:27:23.160
Juice.
That is such a neat story.
You're welcome

376
00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:27.100
to bring this up because I am,

377
00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.480
my friend came over last night and he's single and he's on Tinder,

378
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:35.370
which is not just a fuck site anymore apparently.
It's not just for fuck boys.

379
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.490
We've missed that boat completely.
Totally.

380
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.150
Do you know that when Tom and I started seeing each other,

381
00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:44.730
there was Friendster and myspace.
It's true.

382
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:48.000
Everyone on my space was the shit.
Like you need to update your profile

383
00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:53.700
and like putting music on there and everyone was so excited and that became

384
00:27:53.701 --> 00:27:58.110
[inaudible] planned.
How did that,
that transition was,

385
00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.650
I feel like that was quick.
My space was the like if you were a comic,

386
00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.730
you plug your dates on there.

387
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:10.080
It was the thing and Dane Cook fucking hard at that.
Started that whole thing,

388
00:28:10.081 --> 00:28:11.070
man.
And he would like,

389
00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:15.750
he would email every single person back that emailed it and we're talking not

390
00:28:15.751 --> 00:28:19.800
like a hundred emails,
like it would thousands would pouring millions.

391
00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:21.770
He was the first person to have like right.

392
00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:26.940
But I'm saying he was engaging everybody and then I feel like it was like one

393
00:28:27.331 --> 00:28:31.380
day you were just like,
hey my space and they're like you fucking piece of shit.

394
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:35.280
And like they would talk to you like you were bleeding out of your neck.

395
00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:38.150
That's how Friendster was to remember.

396
00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:42.000
I don't remember what Friendster was precursor to my space and it was even,

397
00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:45.270
it was lamer though.
You could only put like pictures of yourself.

398
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:49.290
There was nothing shiny or razzle dazzle.
It was just like here's me.

399
00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:56.460
People could like were you on Friendster?
Of course.
2004 dude.

400
00:28:56.550 --> 00:29:00.240
Wow,
Super Rad.
But I was thinking,
what about Lincoln done?
Where are you on

401
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:06.840
Linkedin?
Fuck Lincoln.
Then clap if you're on Lincoln.

402
00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:10.050
Some people
down,

403
00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:13.370
I get offers.
I declined.

404
00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:19.800
What I was thinking how great it would be if you are on Tinder and what your

405
00:29:19.891 --> 00:29:20.880
profile would be.

406
00:29:20.881 --> 00:29:25.170
Cause I know if you were single you'd be so fucking lost in this digital

407
00:29:25.171 --> 00:29:29.400
wasteland.
What you're talking about.

408
00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:31.350
Cause you're retarded.
Like you wouldn't know

409
00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:35.730
like little stuff like okay.
Okay.

410
00:29:35.731 --> 00:29:38.640
Cause we learned last night that when you swipe,
okay,

411
00:29:38.641 --> 00:29:41.770
so the first picture that you see somebody that's the lead photo,

412
00:29:41.771 --> 00:29:44.980
that's the most important photo.
That's,
that's your a game bro.

413
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:48.840
So like don't put a fucking picture with you and your friend.

414
00:29:48.841 --> 00:29:52.150
Cause now it's confusing.
Yeah.
Why would you fucking,

415
00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.620
cause we were going through our friends and like every like third girl,

416
00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:58.300
there was two girls in the picture.
We're like,
well what's bitch isn't man,

417
00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:02.720
which one of them's a sluttier one.

418
00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.440
We were trying to hook him up last night.
And like some of the girls,

419
00:30:08.441 --> 00:30:11.820
like their lead thing was like,
no hookups were like fucking Xq.

420
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:18.933
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

421
00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:23.710
<v 2>So excited though.
This whole world of hooking up.
So anyway,
okay.</v>

422
00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.770
So I was like,
I wonder what Toms would be.
Here's your lead photo.
I know it.

423
00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:33.230
Dick and balls.
What do you mean?
And you're like,
suck my stuff.

424
00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:39.110
Am I right?
You guys know him.
Yeah.
It'd be like,

425
00:30:39.111 --> 00:30:41.220
you guys want to suck this?
No,

426
00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:45.520
because I know that that wouldn't lead to it getting sucked.
So while I chair,

427
00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:49.570
well,
what's your lead photo be thinking about that photo.
All right,

428
00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:53.430
here's my take photo to like try to get,
you know,
Tinder swiped right.

429
00:30:53.431 --> 00:30:54.680
And so here we go.
Go ahead.

430
00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:56.543
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

431
00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:03.950
<v 2>Wow.
Wow.
No,
I think you have to like down,
you can't do like this.</v>

432
00:31:03.951 --> 00:31:06.050
Some people have that obnoxious photo.

433
00:31:06.051 --> 00:31:07.550
You have to kind of downplay it a little bit.

434
00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:11.780
What people overshoot because people put photos that like are too flattering.

435
00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.950
You know?
Let's start with a headshot,
like a professional

436
00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:19.260
Robin von Swank.
You know,

437
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.580
I would hold the camera down here so that like,

438
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:26.390
like double chins or accentuated and then if you meet me,
be like,

439
00:31:26.391 --> 00:31:30.530
that's even better than I thought.
That's what I would do.

440
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:34.310
No bitch is going to click on you.
Fucking double Chins.
Maybe.

441
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.310
Maybe some sad ones that are wellness.
Oh good.

442
00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:43.520
You're a genius.
Yeah.
I'm not looking for a serious thing.

443
00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:46.460
Stupid.

444
00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:52.450
We did see that some people put like,
like,

445
00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:56.120
you know some people do real serious shit like,
yeah man,
tell I'm intellectual.

446
00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.530
Some girl had the fucking,

447
00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:03.050
some girl had her list.
She was like,
it must be muscular.

448
00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:06.610
This habit must have a certain income.
If you don't,

449
00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:12.050
then go ahead and swipe it.
I was like,
this bitch,
I hope you get a virus.
Like I,

450
00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:17.650
I hope your profile gets a virus.
I'm serious.

451
00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:21.440
It's Patti Stanger would say that it's unreasonable.
Do the lists,

452
00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:26.210
the list is stupid.
No,
you shouldn't have like you have to meet every single one.

453
00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:29.240
It's a dumb way to meet somebody.
There was the one kid though,

454
00:32:29.241 --> 00:32:33.050
he had the funny set.
Sometimes I think the funny ones are the way to go.
Right?

455
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:36.240
Because women always say humor,

456
00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:39.890
but not really because you're the guy with the sense of,
you know what I mean?

457
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:47.820
<v 5>No,
I'm just saying a lot of women can't handle what is,
I love him.</v>

458
00:32:47.821 --> 00:32:50.860
You know that he's my heart.
I would lay down my life for this motherfucker,

459
00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.160
but she's always saying

460
00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:57.280
<v 0>people like you like,
but it's little shit.</v>

461
00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:01.820
<v 5>Like,
we're finished banging and then he literally does roll over and go</v>

462
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:06.790
<v 0>get out.
You would find that charming if you were with me?</v>

463
00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:08.330
Yes.

464
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:11.470
<v 3>Would it wouldn't be like,
oh,
like just may you be like,
get out of here bitch.</v>

465
00:33:11.471 --> 00:33:12.400
That wasn't only like that,

466
00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:16.960
<v 5>that,
but it's funny.
And then he was farting.</v>

467
00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:21.010
We made sweet love.
And then two minutes later you farted in the bed and,

468
00:33:21.011 --> 00:33:24.820
but then he goes,
why don't you give me credit?
I was like,
for what?
He goes,

469
00:33:24.821 --> 00:33:26.350
I've been holding them in all night.

470
00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:30.130
<v 0>That's real life stuff.</v>

471
00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:36.100
We're going to act like I'm the only dude that does that.
No,

472
00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:40.430
you do it too.
And you also want credit.
You want,
I'm not asking

473
00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:44.700
<v 3>you to fucking like be like,
why?
Like buy me a gift.
But how about you go,
wow,</v>

474
00:33:44.701 --> 00:33:48.080
that's really,
uh,

475
00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.600
you weren't credit for holding in a fart while we're doing it.
That doesn't,

476
00:33:51.601 --> 00:33:55.600
that's not,
we'll do that all the time.
Right.
But they don't want credits.
Again,

477
00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:59.070
it's a given.
I'm the only one brave enough to speak up for this

478
00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:00.123
<v 0>community.</v>

479
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:07.490
<v 5>But then my favorite part.
So you farted and then I looked over,
we were just,</v>

480
00:34:07.491 --> 00:34:11.150
we were just talking about life or whatnot.
And you're picking your toes

481
00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:15.200
and then he ripped off a Tony.
Yeah.

482
00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:16.173
<v 0>Huh.</v>

483
00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:18.600
<v 5>And then did one of these</v>

484
00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:25.510
over the floor.
Right.
So as not to get it in the bed,

485
00:34:25.511 --> 00:34:26.920
which I do appreciate.

486
00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:33.160
<v 0>That's all I'm asking for it.
Thank you.
And you're welcome.
So wait,</v>

487
00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.910
<v 5>but that's the guy with a sense of humor that's on the,
go ahead.</v>

488
00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:42.390
<v 3>There was the,
the kid with the funny profile that was,
sorry.
Go.
Yeah.
Funny.</v>

489
00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:46.470
I like that one picture of him,
he was 18,

490
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:47.880
he wearing sunglasses.

491
00:34:47.881 --> 00:34:52.140
He has a cigarette hanging out of his mouth and he has a rifle and he's like,

492
00:34:52.141 --> 00:34:54.420
the butt of it is in his hip.
And he's like,

493
00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.320
and in his profile was,
um,

494
00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:02.580
what's the difference between Jelly and jam?
And then it said,

495
00:35:02.581 --> 00:35:04.170
I can't Jelly a dick in your ass.

496
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:09.550
<v 0>That's good.
That's a funny kid.</v>

497
00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:14.410
You wouldn't swipe right on that and know why not.

498
00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.900
He's funny you like,

499
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:20.490
<v 3>I think that's a funny kid.
Right?
Funny guys.
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah.</v>

500
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:21.743
And if he were,

501
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:27.240
what did your critique to that kid?
What's wrong with that?

502
00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:31.200
That's a funny approach,
Babe.
Babe,

503
00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:36.900
what?
No,
you,
I would encourage that kid every day.
If I knew him,
I'd be like,

504
00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:38.010
step it up dude.
Push it

505
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:38.843
<v 2>harder.
Like,
yeah,</v>

506
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:44.510
I would be so bad at this profile would be a fucking real with your bio line.

507
00:35:45.691 --> 00:35:50.400
Be fucking I do it.
I don't know.
Fucking dude.

508
00:35:50.401 --> 00:35:54.610
I don't know.
And I would swipe.
I'd be like,
this chick is cool.

509
00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:59.050
That would interest me.
Here's what I would do.
Real talk.

510
00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:01.900
I'd be very honest and direct.
I'd be like,

511
00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:06.250
I don't have any fucking hobbies because I work and I have a kid and I like to

512
00:36:06.251 --> 00:36:10.870
watch a lot of TV.
Do you like to sleep a lot?
I like to sleep.

513
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.610
I like to eat.
I don't like doing stuff

514
00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:19.170
well cause I fucking don't.

515
00:36:19.171 --> 00:36:22.680
The fact that we have a kid and makes us do stuff all the time and that's like,

516
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:27.270
it's a lot.
No.
But look,
if,
if,
if you're on this,

517
00:36:27.271 --> 00:36:30.570
it means that you're newly single,
so you'd be a little more excited than that.

518
00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:34.410
I know you'd be bad,
but here's the thing,
when I was single,

519
00:36:34.411 --> 00:36:37.200
when you and I started dating,
I kept it 100 like that,

520
00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:40.080
cause you call me the first time to ask for a date and you're like,
Hey,

521
00:36:40.081 --> 00:36:43.050
do you want to go hiking?
And I was like,
fuck no,

522
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.210
that's true.
That's true.

523
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:51.180
Sorry I to go on a hike because it was like a very la,
it's a nice thing to do.

524
00:36:51.181 --> 00:36:55.940
I know.
And Anyway,
I hung up and that's the thing is I didn't hike.
You know,

525
00:36:55.980 --> 00:37:00.510
it wasn't like I was just like,
oh that's a cool guy,
la date.

526
00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:05.070
Like do you want to go on a hike?
And then you see them all hiking,

527
00:37:05.071 --> 00:37:09.510
look good looking people.
So I asked her like,
I'll pretend to be that guy.

528
00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:13.680
And she was like,
no,
I don't want to like that.
But I didn't,

529
00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:17.520
I didn't put it together that you were asking me out on a date until I hung up.

530
00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:19.500
And then I felt really bad.
I was like,
oh my God,

531
00:37:19.501 --> 00:37:22.680
I think Tom Segura I just tried to ask me on a day and I fucked it all up dude.

532
00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:26.520
So then like I forget how I think I told my friend to tell you I liked you or

533
00:37:26.521 --> 00:37:29.760
something stupid.
And then we ended up going to a star in sixth grade.

534
00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:38.000
I go,
I just asked her how he was like,
Oh okay.

535
00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.060
Yeah,
cause I don't know how to date.
Like I don't know how to do it.

536
00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:42.913
I call you and you're like,

537
00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.720
the funny thing is though,
I asked,

538
00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:55.810
I asked her out on a date,
I asked her to marry your mom.

539
00:37:56.210 --> 00:38:01.210
I asked her out on a date to go on a hike and she said no.

540
00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:03.890
And then I asked her out again and she goes,
yeah,

541
00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:07.010
how about I'll pick the place I know a bar where you can still smoke.

542
00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:10.640
And that's where we ended up going.
So we went from hiking to a bar.

543
00:38:10.641 --> 00:38:14.060
You can still smoke
now.

544
00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.180
I to God,

545
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:21.860
we should bring this guy.
Fuck yeah,
dude,

546
00:38:21.861 --> 00:38:23.360
we're so stoked for this.

547
00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:27.110
One of the all time hall of fame,

548
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:29.810
greatest guests we've ever had.

549
00:38:29.811 --> 00:38:34.811
We'll get it is back here with us and we could not be happier to have him.

550
00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:36.130
Uh,
you know

551
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:37.750
<v 7>him.
You love him.</v>

552
00:38:37.751 --> 00:38:42.370
Please give a warm round of applause to the one and only Yoshi.

553
00:38:42.371 --> 00:38:43.204
Everybody.
Yeah.

554
00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:09.170
All right.
I was told me it's going to be one minute.

555
00:39:09.171 --> 00:39:13.610
I've been wearing that thing.
What happened?
Our,
oh my God.
Oh,

556
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:17.630
that was our pup play.
Mom.
Make a terrible rapist.
Alright.

A lot of people surprise when Trump won.
Yeah.
A lot of the,

573
00:40:29.651 --> 00:40:32.410
a politician,
analysts and people were wrong.

574
00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:37.120
There's one industry predicted this last three terms,
four terms.

575
00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:42.360
It's pornography.
Pornography predicted the winners.
Last jury presidents.

576
00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:46.360
Wait,
who in pornography?
No,

577
00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:49.360
I'm a little before Obama won.
Yeah.

578
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:51.460
The most popular porn at the place I used to work.

579
00:40:51.461 --> 00:40:55.770
The boy angel was interracial porn.
America was ready for black man.

580
00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:57.530
Right in the White House.
Right.

581
00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:04.150
Now some of you saying yourself.
How did pornography predict Bush?
Uh,

582
00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:09.310
late nineties.
Uh,
the most popular point at that time is torture porn.

583
00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:13.120
Wow.
You know,
you grab a girl's hair and put it in the toilet,

584
00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:18.460
not a boarding America was ready for it.
Right,

585
00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:23.150
So
I know what you're saying.

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:29.643
<v 4>No,</v>

589
00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:35.950
<v 7>the people in pornography called taboo relation,
but you know what it is right?</v>

590
00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:39.170
I want to fuck Umami or step brother this and that.
Right.

591
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:41.870
If you listen to Trump,

592
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:45.020
when you talk about your bunker Trump so many times he said,

593
00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:49.520
if she wasn't my daughter,
I would date her.
That was that same way into my head.

594
00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:53.660
Come Outta my other here.
What he's saying is I want to fuck my daughter.

595
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:55.190
That's what I'm hearing.
Yeah.

596
00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:59.930
And that's the normal ear and down into my balls.

597
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:03.440
I like that.
Yeah,
that was nice.
Yeah,
it was good.

598
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:05.780
I have come all over my face now.

599
00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:14.640
<v 4>It's great to be back.
So good to see you do.
Fans are the best.</v>

600
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Nicest people.
There's a lot of 40 people

601
00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:25.350
<v 7>business,
but um,
Christina,
Tom,
they're always great offstage and uh,
you know,</v>

602
00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.760
she's always concerned about me.
They get therapy and things like that.

603
00:42:27.761 --> 00:42:31.900
It's not going to happen.
But um,
if I can beat you up,
I can't get hard.

604
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:35.023
<v 4>But</v>

605
00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:36.621
<v 7>you bought,</v>

606
00:42:36.621 --> 00:42:40.230
we also are always asking because you've been doing some of the medical testing.

607
00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:43.550
Yeah.
Have you been doing it lately?
Um,
I'm,
I'm,

608
00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.090
I'm currently for a couple of them.

609
00:42:45.091 --> 00:42:49.050
I'm getting ready to do another one within a week or so.
And uh,
cirrhosis.

610
00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:53.040
And what was the other one?
Um,
hepatitis B or something.
I Dunno.
Um,

611
00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:58.670
sometime when I don't qualify for studies,
I am a recruiter.
So like I,

612
00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:02.460
if I don't have a,
um,
lady problem,
I look at,
you know,

613
00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:07.020
go around the mall and look for someone.
Well,
what do you mean?

614
00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.500
What does that mean?
So like there'll be like a medical test,

615
00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:12.280
but it will be only for women only for winning.

616
00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:15.360
So you'll just walk up to and be like,
hey,

617
00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:20.220
it was really awkward because recently,
recently there was a study,

618
00:43:20.221 --> 00:43:24.870
for some reason they were looking for people with a surgical co and their body

619
00:43:24.871 --> 00:43:29.640
two inches or longer.
So,
um,
I was at the mall recently,

620
00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:33.150
why?
I went the morning hot dog and like,
um,
because I didn't qualify,

621
00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:37.800
I was low on cash.
Then I see this group of teenage girls,

622
00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:40.650
one of them kinda got up kind of Pinto.
We're trying to get something.

623
00:43:40.651 --> 00:43:44.970
And I noticed she had a cut in a,
you know,
buy this has cheek right near there.

624
00:43:44.971 --> 00:43:48.960
Right.
This is,
this is going and that like,
I wasn't really thinking,
excuse me.

625
00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:53.430
Halloween's you'll cut in your back,
whatever.
Right.
God dammit.

626
00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:56.730
They all gave me this really look like,
oh no,
this is about it.

627
00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:01.040
So one of them rent to security
and I just turned around,

628
00:44:01.041 --> 00:44:03.630
ran out like remember this,
he tagged you run.

629
00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:08.430
<v 4>I haven't been because he was,
I don't know if it was awkward.
They did it.</v>

630
00:44:08.431 --> 00:44:10.020
They have a really weird energy.

631
00:44:10.021 --> 00:44:13.830
So don't you hear how much worse it sounds right now or yeah.
Now,

632
00:44:13.831 --> 00:44:15.660
but I would thought was helping her

633
00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:20.293
do,
man,

634
00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:27.690
he gave me this really low.
We're look.
Yeah.

635
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:32.010
And then one went to a security guard.
And um,
do you remember the

636
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:36.570
<v 7>scene from taxi driver when uh,
dineros caregiver Trevis Beko trying to kill,</v>

637
00:44:36.571 --> 00:44:39.300
send the parenting and just talking to the secret service and like,

638
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:41.250
he's just going to run out.
That's what I fucking dead.

639
00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:44.010
I ran the fuck on it there because you know,

640
00:44:44.011 --> 00:44:46.470
in past I've been accused of things that's not true.
Yeah.

641
00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:51.760
<v 2>Huh?
How old,
how old were they,
would you guess?</v>

642
00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:54.460
I don't know.
15 to 18

643
00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:58.570
I wasn't sure.

644
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:04.600
How long has that scar on you?
I to go,

645
00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:07.530
<v 7>but it was $200 he find,</v>

646
00:45:07.531 --> 00:45:11.010
found the person and another 200 if she finished the study.
So that's 400

647
00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:15.260
<v 2>wow.
That's worth it.
So great.</v>

648
00:45:15.261 --> 00:45:20.020
Am I in that post office?
$200 sorry.
She gets Thomas.

649
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:22.230
Does she get to do this study?
400 if she does the whole thing,

650
00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:28.040
I get 400 think she gets like 2,500 Oh my God.
Yeah.

651
00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.030
Yeah.
I'm giving

652
00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:35.900
<v 7>how many teenage girls make 2,540 days.
That a few but not a lot.
Yeah.</v>

653
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.770
<v 4>Okay.</v>

654
00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:41.190
<v 7>And that's a tricky question.
It depends on the color of the skin.
All right.
Um,</v>

655
00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:47.110
funny in Texas.
All right.

656
00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:50.820
<v 4>Oh,

657
00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.020
<v 7>Do you guys ever get in trouble because I'm on your show.</v>

658
00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:57.740
I did worry about that some time.
I'm now,
our audience is the best.
They don't.

659
00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:59.000
Yeah.
There's no offended.

660
00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:02.590
<v 2>Yeah,
no,
you guys don't give a shit.
Honestly,</v>

661
00:46:02.591 --> 00:46:05.380
I couldn't imagine a podcast show on Sunday two shows.

662
00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:08.920
500 people bananas.
This is so funny.

663
00:46:08.921 --> 00:46:13.510
This is a show we were talking to like our manager or something like this is a

664
00:46:13.511 --> 00:46:17.590

665
00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:21.700

666
00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:27.010
<v 3>So that opening clip was about this new product that we can't show them a</v>

667
00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:28.700
obviously,
but they can hear it.

668
00:46:28.701 --> 00:46:33.440
And I want to know if you have ever experimented with something like this.

669
00:46:33.441 --> 00:46:36.410
You'll see it on the screen here.
Okay.
No,
the screen in front of me.

670
00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.433
<v 2>Oh sorry.</v>

671
00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:41.820
<v 7>I was confused.
I was confused.
Asian eyes,
what can I say?</v>

672
00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:46.120
<v 2>These realistic,</v>

673
00:46:46.121 --> 00:46:50.710
deep throat simulators are available in two varieties including blonde and

674
00:46:50.711 --> 00:46:53.170
Brunette to fulfill all your fantasies.

675
00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:57.310
<v 3>So it's basically the severed head of a woman.</v>

676
00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:04.280
<v 2>You know what it looks like it was something like that.
No,
but um,</v>

677
00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:05.780
those Barbie heads,

678
00:47:05.781 --> 00:47:08.960
he used to put makeup on when you're a little girl in the 80s and the,

679
00:47:08.961 --> 00:47:13.710
except it's got a map.
And then like the,
I like this way and the mouth is like,

680
00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:19.650
but only way I could use that.
I gotta Punch one that I first had a

681
00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:22.560

682
00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:27.090
<v 7>sure.
That the severed head with the mouth hole that you can</v>

683
00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:28.083

684
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:33.400
<v 0>just the bum member of the side cut off</v>

685
00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:36.670
this hole in the vagina.

686
00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:40.370
The head thing is definitely kind of creepy eyes,

687
00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:47.680
corpse eyes,
just like it.
It's not the same thing.
But when I,

688
00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:50.590
when I moved to your first,
you know what really freaked me out,

689
00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:53.380
cause we never seen this thing in Japan is um,

690
00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:58.090
I don't know if they still have it has a horse's head with a s just a stick.

691
00:47:58.091 --> 00:48:01.570
You right.
Yes.

692
00:48:01.571 --> 00:48:05.380
Because where's the rest of the fucking body?
You know?

693
00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:09.870
And my mom said this is a poor country.
They can't put the whole damn thing.
Yeah.

694
00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:13.800
But that really freaked me out because they didn't really freak you out.

695
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:16.200
Said is it,
am I the only one?
It looks really nice.

696
00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:20.490
It's a stick with a fucking the head.
Yeah.

697
00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:23.380
You're supposed to pretend to ride the horse.
Oh yeah.
Well,

698
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:25.330
this whole actually fucked the mouth.

699
00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:28.610
There's different similar idea though.

700
00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:31.330
<v 6>They have hair.
You can style</v>

701
00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:34.180
<v 0>stretchy mouth about anyone</v>

702
00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:38.850
<v 6>throat that will feel as good,
if not better than the real thing.</v>

703
00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:42.500
<v 0>That's a good point there.
And here's the best part.</v>

704
00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:47.130
<v 6>Unlike some girls who don't know how to give head or aren't in the mood,</v>

705
00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:51.840
these realistic beauties know how to Suck Dick and will never say no.

706
00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:58.260
<v 0>This bitch never says no because she's like,</v>

707
00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:04.080
she never says anything.
That's right.
That's the dream.

708
00:49:08.890 --> 00:49:12.720
I kind of much prefer if they're kind of close to each other like Siamese twin

709
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:17.630
because have you ever seen the these twin like,
uh,
happy?

710
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:21.180
I've seen one where one is really hot,
but other ones ugly.

711
00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:25.560
I've seen one.
It was just like,
I noticed the hot one,
so like,
okay,

712
00:49:25.561 --> 00:49:29.160
so the hot ones giving the guy a blow job and other ones maybe reading a book

713
00:49:29.161 --> 00:49:32.640
with that,
you know,
flipping the book like this,
you know what I mean?

714
00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:37.950
Is it just okay?
Just me.
All right.
Um
Huh.

715
00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.250
<v 6>In addition to realistic hair.</v>

716
00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:46.930
Each one comes with lipstick for an even more lifelike experience.

717
00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:53.250
<v 0>Yeah,
I liked it.
It feels like real life.
What about the cleanup on the head?
Oh,</v>

718
00:49:53.310 --> 00:49:54.430
that's the next clip.
Oh,

719
00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:58.680
<v 6>you'll find on the bottom of the neck there's a drain hole.</v>

720
00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:03.330
<v 0>Flusher
drain.</v>

721
00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:12.740
They say they call it the flush your debris.
Debris.

722
00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:16.400
I don't know why it's called debris that could own clam chowder mouth.

723
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:20.690
You know I'm calling about,
um,
I'm from Seattle,
so I'm

724
00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:27.050
salty.
I made a fan of flesh,
which mimics the look and feel of real.

725
00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:28.100
He's like,

726
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.770
<v 7>it's stretchy,
soft and durable.</v>

727
00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:35.910
You can be as rough as you like or practice essential throat fucking so that

728
00:50:35.911 --> 00:50:40.790
you're a better letter for your girlfriend or wife or your girlfriend or wife.

729
00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:45.070
That's why I got one
though.

730
00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:49.160
You'd lab might be a deal breaker if you file your boyfriend's head that he's

731
00:50:49.161 --> 00:50:52.820
been fucking
really,

732
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:56.550
I don't know if I can continue.
Oh,
but it's got the drain plug.

733
00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:02.390
What do you think those Chinese people making dose in Beijing at the warehouse?

734
00:51:02.391 --> 00:51:06.800
You know,
they're like eight year old Slade neighbors.
Making it for are

735
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:11.840
now.
You can't bind them because fucking Trump's going to,
you know,
alright,

736
00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:16.550
you ruined this whole industry.
We got to make them here in America.

737
00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:19.670
Tell us about this story.
Can I play a one of your old yeah,

738
00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:23.600
I fucked the girl with no arms and one leg.

739
00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:31.510
Yes I did.
Um,
I'm trying to,
I can't remember the Buddha.

740
00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:35.360
Remember.
I can't,
that would be my story.

741
00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:39.230
I would open while you guys were here.
A fucking crazy story,

742
00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:44.960
Tommy.
I mean,
we're talking about,
I know you've been with a lot of women,

743
00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:49.580
no fucking no arms and one leg and you're like,

744
00:51:49.581 --> 00:51:53.580
was that fucking Austin or I,

745
00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:58.260
I'm have girls with missing limb,
um,
here and there

746
00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:04.850
and Eastern Europe and uh,
I'm not,
I'm not prejudice against them.

747
00:52:05.110 --> 00:52:07.880
You shouldn't be.
But I thought it would,
I didn't know it was like,
you're like,

748
00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:11.450
ah,
fucking happens all the time.
I didn't know it was one of those.
Wait,

749
00:52:11.451 --> 00:52:14.480
does she have a leg?
I thought she didn't have any,
I can't remember.

750
00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:22.970
I've had situation where I went to down on a girl.
Yeah.

751
00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:27.340
And it
does limit us.
All right.
Um,

752
00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:33.830
and I remember going down like,
oh,
because of the taste,
I remember like,

753
00:52:33.831 --> 00:52:36.530
she changed her hair,
so she didn't,
she didn't look that way I to remember three,

754
00:52:36.531 --> 00:52:40.640
four years ago.
But going down to her and it's like a fingerprint.

755
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:45.670
Everyone have a specific flavor to them and you don't like wine connoisseur but

756
00:52:45.981 --> 00:52:50.410
me,
I just,
you know,
there's like a fingerprints,
whatever flavor.

757
00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:53.060
So you were like,
I remember you,

758
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:56.000
I don't remember her feet by like Sarah

759
00:52:58.630 --> 00:53:02.230
really because women change their hair,
whatever,
like divert to sit there,
right?

760
00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:04.760
Yeah.
Like they're evil,

761
00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:09.500
but the taste I remember.
Yeah,
I remember you.

762
00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:13.970
And you're a member of the amputees taste is what you're saying.

763
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:18.650
Or because there's been more than one,
but uh,
it's always eastern Europe and um,

764
00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:21.650
have a good attitude.
They always have a better attitude.
Fucking better.

765
00:53:21.651 --> 00:53:26.040
Have a good attitude.
Yeah.
To,
if you had an

766
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:30.930
<v 3>amputee,
hooker,
limbless bad addict,</v>

767
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:33.473
you shut up.

768
00:53:33.970 --> 00:53:37.520
<v 7>I don't know if I had to put a telephone book and aside because the missing
limb,</v>

769
00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:40.340
I don't,
I'm trying to remember how that

770
00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:44.610
so funny.
All right.
So,
um,

771
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.590
<v 3>wait,
so we were talking about,
because you know,
we've been together since,
since,</v>

772
00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:53.790
uh,
online dating took off.
Do you do online anything,

773
00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:56.160
like any Tinder profiles,
anything like that?

774
00:53:56.290 --> 00:53:59.740
<v 7>No,
never.
No,
but no,</v>

775
00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:01.870
I'm kind of old fat.
No,

776
00:54:01.871 --> 00:54:05.600
because you're not old fashioned technology wise.

777
00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:08.283
There's nothing.

778
00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:13.580
I've only got one prostitute and states when I was under age kid,

779
00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:17.290
like this is like I told you this before,
1985,
summer of 85,

780
00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:21.700
I got kicked out of Washington state.
I moved to Long Beach and there was this,

781
00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:25.640
yeah,
it's great.
I mean it's nice now.
It wasn't back in those days,

782
00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:29.380
let's be honest.
But um,
it's nice now,
but,
um,
black girl.

783
00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:34.660
But other than that,
all the hookers spending like Canada,
Mexico and Europe,

784
00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:37.420
Brazil,
I don't think I've ever,

785
00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:41.620
it's weird where I grew up in Japan,
uh,
prostitution,

786
00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:46.030
it's like normal par,
you know,
it's um,
we have a big hangup.

787
00:54:46.031 --> 00:54:50.740
Well because it's just a job to rest of the world.
But I'm like,

788
00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:52.270
I just got back from Europe.

789
00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:55.730
Remember that illegal magazine when I was talking to you guys?
Yeah.

790
00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:59.930
They have a secondary business called six salons where we have a van,
uh,

791
00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:01.690
parking in a neighborhood in Denmark.

792
00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:06.820
And a prostitute will take their John into a van,
fuck them.

793
00:55:06.821 --> 00:55:10.090
And to have a chair,
if you know,
if you want to get a blowjob,
it's right there.

794
00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:14.950
They have a knee pads so they don't hurt themselves.
There's comm games.
Um,
so,

795
00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:18.970
so we're,
we're protecting these women because,
um,

796
00:55:21.010 --> 00:55:23.310
because a lot of the prostitutes,
street hookers,

797
00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:25.210
they have a high percent of getting murdered.

798
00:55:25.211 --> 00:55:29.450
So we were providing a safe place to clean their business.
Um,

799
00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:33.440
I know,
I know some people think is funny,
but last few years my big way,

800
00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:41.290
but I think six worksheets be protected all forms cause otherwise,

801
00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:45.710
thanks again.
Brutalized and hooked on drugs and yeah,

802
00:55:45.711 --> 00:55:47.050
and we should just legalize because ladies,

803
00:55:47.051 --> 00:55:50.830
put yourself in a situation where maybe you didn't have a good luck and you're

804
00:55:50.831 --> 00:55:51.431
desperate.

805
00:55:51.431 --> 00:55:55.420
And this is one of the few things available to take care of your family.
Uh,

806
00:55:55.570 --> 00:56:00.220
last thing you need is you cops harassing you and the crazy customers.

807
00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:04.810
I'm,
I'm,
I'm all for protecting these women,
you know?
Well,

808
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:06.530
go really quiet here.
Okay.
Anyway,

809
00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:10.850
<v 3>so wait,
do you think you'd be a good,
you'd be a good hoe though.</v>

810
00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:14.900
If you were a prostitute,
what do you think you'd be a good prostitute?

811
00:56:16.030 --> 00:56:19.610
<v 7>No,
look at me,
but I mean,
what would your attitude be like?</v>

812
00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:21.090
Like show me,

813
00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:28.130
show me what it means.
Me being processed.

814
00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:32.910
<v 5>Yes,
he knows so much.
Let's just role play for a second.
No.</v>

815
00:56:32.970 --> 00:56:34.920
Have you ever considered it?
All right,

816
00:56:34.921 --> 00:56:37.340
so how much experience have you ever considered being a male?

817
00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:40.950
<v 7>I'm more customer.
I mean,
I buy food from restaurant.
That's not me.</v>

818
00:56:40.951 --> 00:56:44.760
I'm going to be a good chef.
I think you'd be like,

819
00:56:44.761 --> 00:56:47.590
let's just try it for a second.
It's like an actress becomes director.

820
00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:49.260
Here's the closest thing I've ever done.

821
00:56:50.730 --> 00:56:55.320
When I used to work in tableau video in downtown Seattle,
we have,
you know,

822
00:56:55.650 --> 00:56:56.640
a lot of young people don't know,

823
00:56:56.641 --> 00:57:00.150
but they used to have these booths in the back where guys go in,

824
00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:03.980
put a quarter on what you should it.
Right?
Yeah.
Just go ahead it too.
Yeah.
So,

825
00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:08.220
so taboo BDO,
I used to work there and we used to get this handicap guy,

826
00:57:08.221 --> 00:57:11.760
he's in one of this mechanical wheelchair,
right?
So he goes in,

827
00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:16.530
so you know,
cause disability.
So I got to open the door,

828
00:57:17.250 --> 00:57:19.970
pull him in there.
He got a little fucking whiny.
Like Ooh,

829
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:24.320
could you unzip my zipper,
whatever.
Like oh
fuck.

830
00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:28.050
But I don't want to be prejudice against handicap people.
Right,
right.

831
00:57:28.051 --> 00:57:31.040
It's not like,
oh get it down.
So I don't know my handicapped people,

832
00:57:31.041 --> 00:57:36.000
but really long zipper.
But anyway,
I pull it down,
pull his pants down.

833
00:57:36.030 --> 00:57:40.830
I don't want look and put a quarter and a close the door.
Right.

834
00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:44.640
And,
and then,
uh,
I don't know,
15,
20 minutes later or something,

835
00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:49.200
some customers say,
hey,
I need your help,
whatever.
So I have to go in,

836
00:57:49.201 --> 00:57:51.900
I put a glove on,
you know what I mean?
Their customer,
they're people too.

837
00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:55.240
You know what handicapped people deserve to have orgasms.
Yeah,
sure.

838
00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:58.380
They deserve it.
Yeah.
So like fuck,
I don't want to,
you know,

839
00:57:58.381 --> 00:58:00.700
because all the coworkers and I'm the rookie new kid,

840
00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:05.430
so I have to do all the work.
So,
um,
so I go in,
it's a fucking mess.
Right?

841
00:58:05.431 --> 00:58:06.700
So cool.

842
00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:09.730
<v 5>Wait,
wait.
He can't touch his,</v>

843
00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:17.600
<v 7>could you help me and night and he's,
you know,
he's doing his business.
I call it,</v>

844
00:58:17.601 --> 00:58:21.960
I don't want to look at it as buck.
I'm not a Weirdo.
So,
um,

845
00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:25.070
he can touch it though.
I guess you could touch it,
but you know,

846
00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:29.670
his hands are on spot up lights like this.
Right.
No matter what.

847
00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:32.730
I didn't do that.
Jesus dead.
All right.
Um,

848
00:58:35.610 --> 00:58:40.110
so,
um,
yeah,
you tried to do the Zipper,

849
00:58:40.111 --> 00:58:42.780
which a fucking crap fingers.
Right?
So,
um,

850
00:58:43.530 --> 00:58:47.310
so I don't know,
somehow he,
your guy wins at hand.

851
00:58:47.311 --> 00:58:51.630
One on one arm is shorter than the other one,
you know,
uh,
look like fenders,
roof.

852
00:58:51.690 --> 00:58:55.620
So anyway,
he does his business.
It's all weird.
Right?
I can't,
I can't,

853
00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:59.220
I can't just kicked out,
get the fuck out of equip or I can't do that.
So,

854
00:58:59.550 --> 00:59:04.080
so I put a glove,
put it on sticky.
They like that,
like,
you know,
funny.

855
00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:06.360
And finally I put find it,

856
00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:10.350
I'm putting him from the front door and his mechanic is leaving.
He goes,

857
00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:15.300
thanks a lot.
Faggot.
And he just leave like that.
That's so rude.

858
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:20.520
1999.
Seattle.
That's a true story.
All right.
So

859
00:59:22.050 --> 00:59:24.830
<v 2>that's what he used to be able to call people faggots.</v>

860
00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:29.360
That's the real me part of that story.
Right?
It's just like the gays.
No.

861
00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:31.550
So you put his dick away for him.

862
00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:38.330
You kind of skipped over that part a little bit.
Um,
I don't know.
How did I do it?

863
00:59:38.331 --> 00:59:42.260
How did it pulled up the underwear that you helped them out?
Right.

864
00:59:43.110 --> 00:59:43.943
You know,

865
00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:49.040
pivot the digging that hole like that and then uh,
you know,
put it,
hold on.

866
00:59:49.041 --> 00:59:52.100
What's a fucking mess?
Boy,
he come every,

867
00:59:52.101 --> 00:59:56.060
I mean I've got a hand at the end to decrypt those.
Have a lot of com.
Yeah.

868
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:05.540
So when we got,
okay,

869
01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:10.970
so we have this or cleaning up the calm on the crippled guy.
Yeah,

870
01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:15.560
that's your job.
Okay.
All right.
Or

871
01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.060
you got to fuck the lady's fake head.

872
01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:23.060
That's your only sexual outlet.

873
01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:26.590
And every time you go out on a first date with a girl,
you have to be like,

874
01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:30.230
my name's Tom and hear Susan and you gotta

875
01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:34.940
you gotta bring her out to dinner.

876
01:00:34.941 --> 01:00:39.800
So it's either clean up the crippled guys stories,

877
01:00:39.801 --> 01:00:43.930
your life,
my life.
You clean up the cripple,
you have to put his,

878
01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:47.960
but then I'm free to have a sexual life.
But that is your job bro.

879
01:00:47.961 --> 01:00:48.990
You do that fucking thing.

880
01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:55.300
I can go on dates and I always have to bring out the severed blowjob ahead and

881
01:00:56.211 --> 01:00:59.570
introduce her to people on a first day immediately.
Immediately.

882
01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:01.670
And you have to show the features,
the Nice,

883
01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:09.320
let's do you know what type of red flag individual would be cool with that?

884
01:01:10.221 --> 01:01:14.180
Like not that like,
cause I said women would be like,
yeah,
that's cool yard.

885
01:01:15.110 --> 01:01:18.470
But if you were like,
nice to meet you,
what should we get to eat?
Hold on though.

886
01:01:18.471 --> 01:01:19.304
One second.

887
01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:25.520
And then you live the debris comes out of the bottom of the neck and if it comes

888
01:01:25.521 --> 01:01:28.310
with realistic lipstick and you have to show her yeah,

889
01:01:28.311 --> 01:01:32.870
you put lipstick on and then open.
I'd be it.
Wait,
you look put a makeup on,
Huh?

890
01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:36.800
Yeah.
Cause it's one of the features.
Yeah.
So,
well there you go.

891
01:01:36.801 --> 01:01:39.590
There's your choices for life.
Go ahead.
I think I'd be,

892
01:01:39.591 --> 01:01:43.140
I'd be mopping up some Jizz on some wheelchairs.
I think it what I was doing.

893
01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:47.530
Yeah.
Yeah.
It doesn't ruin your life as much,
isn't that what you would do?
Yeah,

894
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:50.750
of course.
I mean it's not a cool job.
I mean how many,

895
01:01:50.751 --> 01:01:52.190
it's 40 hours a week of cleaning.

896
01:01:52.191 --> 01:01:56.330
Come off of guys in wheelchairs and putting their penis is back in their pants.

897
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.980
It's not a fun job.
But then you get the rest of your free time.

898
01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:04.790
You might be actually turned on by it.
You don't even know it's true.

899
01:02:04.791 --> 01:02:07.820
You don't know.
Maybe that'd be like that.
Maybe that's your secret.
We all,

900
01:02:07.821 --> 01:02:09.870
you know I've had,
I think,
I know,

901
01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:13.990
I don't think you'd think some with Christina.
I do think I do.
Yeah,

902
01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:15.440
I've heard it enough in the business.

903
01:02:15.441 --> 01:02:19.740
Like some women do like the smells permit and it does what?

904
01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:26.230
<v 3>Collect.
There's 500 people in here,
half to be a woman that you meet me.</v>

905
01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:30.390
There's not a one girl and there's probably one normal cheese,

906
01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:33.810
but there's also,
there's also a number of them shaking their heads right now.

907
01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:36.780
Let's,
uh,

908
01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:41.840
let's get out of just for a moment and we have a master of accents submission

909
01:02:43.290 --> 01:02:45.900
that I would like to play for you.
And um,

910
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:50.990
you can tell me if you can decipher what this human being is saying.

911
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:52.343
Here we go.

912
01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:58.620
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

913
01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:06.240
<v 3>what?
No,
that's not even right.
Give me an accent.</v>

914
01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:11.140
Where is it?
Master sense.
Is this a better one?

915
01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:15.740
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

916
01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:17.420
<v 3>that's fucking horrific.</v>

917
01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:26.450
That's what I heard.
Hold on.
How about this one here?

918
01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:30.010
<v 8>Well,
if you're watching on the Sally and yet,</v>

919
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:33.510
and it was the 40 stuff a minute and you've still got until my first goal,

920
01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:36.570
would you leave and just make it blue?
You wouldn't see what you see.

921
01:03:36.571 --> 01:03:39.510
People leave and come on back.
Holly Pizza boxes and the main stunned in it.

922
01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:41.130
I just think where's the club gone

923
01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:44.540
<v 3>English right there.</v>

924
01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:49.910
I saw Jamaican.
No,

925
01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:56.300
you're definitely last.
Restless.
What are you hearing?

926
01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:01.520
Nobody said,
here's what we've discovered so far.

927
01:04:01.521 --> 01:04:04.760
I'm master of as accents Jello.
It can sound.

928
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:08.150
So like how many people know what that guy was saying?

929
01:04:08.210 --> 01:04:12.560
Do any of you know?
He might know Scott.
Is it Scottish?

930
01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.040
<v 1>Yes,
you're correct.</v>

931
01:04:26.770 --> 01:04:27.910
<v 3>Let's also</v>

932
01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:35.390
three people claim to know what the fuck's going on and how did he do that?

933
01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:38.170
How did he do that?
I don't know man.
I don't know how the fuck you did that.

934
01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:41.740
Do you have like British parents?
Did you study over there?
Live over there.

935
01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:45.940
Weird talk now.

936
01:04:50.330 --> 01:04:52.680
So here's what he actually saw the clip.

937
01:04:52.681 --> 01:04:56.280
He says what you're watching on the Sally and he says if you were watching on

938
01:04:56.281 --> 01:05:01.281
the tele and your house and it was the 42nd minute and you're still going for

939
01:05:01.351 --> 01:05:06.090
that first goal,
would you leave and just make a brew?
You wouldn't.

940
01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:09.990
<v 8>Oh right.
It was the 47 minute and you've still going through our first goal.</v>

941
01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:12.300
Would you leave?
You just make up do you wouldn't

942
01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:18.070
<v 3>now.
Wow.
Right now that I say it,
you're like the fucking matrix.
This is crazy.</v>

943
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:21.411
And then he says,

944
01:05:21.411 --> 01:05:26.210
but you see people leaving and coming back with pizza boxes in the main stand.

945
01:05:26.211 --> 01:05:28.550
I just think where's the club gone?

946
01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:32.100
<v 0>But you see if he fully even [inaudible] pizza boxes in the main stand on it,</v>

947
01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:35.610
I just think where's the club gone?
Wow.
That makes sense.

948
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:40.470
<v 3>Master of accents now.
Wow.
Did you,
were you able to put that together at all?</v>

949
01:05:40.471 --> 01:05:41.940
Sound like Mark Warburg to me.

950
01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:44.970
<v 4>I have terrible years.</v>

951
01:05:45.970 --> 01:05:49.540
<v 0>That sounded like Mark Walberg too.
Yeah.
I don't know why.
Well,</v>

952
01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.020
I want to be in your head so badly.

953
01:05:54.010 --> 01:05:56.950
I want to watch every mark Wahlberg movie with you.

954
01:05:58.820 --> 01:05:59.490
<v 4>Okay.</v>

955
01:05:59.490 --> 01:06:03.300
<v 3>Well,
you know,
we have,
we decided we'd,</v>

956
01:06:03.301 --> 01:06:04.800
since we knew you were going to be a guest,

957
01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:09.720
we would pull some master of accents more in your wheelhouse.

958
01:06:09.870 --> 01:06:10.703
So

959
01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:12.613
<v 4>wait,
what does that mean?</v>

960
01:06:12.790 --> 01:06:14.890
<v 3>Well,
I'll tell you what it means.
Um,</v>

961
01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:20.380
we found some Asians

962
01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:26.140
in English reading and English,
but they have accents.

963
01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:29.680
And I want to know if you can tell,
oh,
what,
what country,

964
01:06:29.830 --> 01:06:34.600
what they're saying even.
Oh,
I think these are Japanese women,
I think.
Yeah.

965
01:06:34.601 --> 01:06:36.280
So this is,
um,
are they crying?

966
01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:39.410
<v 4>That's Japanese.
Alright.</v>

967

975
01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:16.440

Yes.

976
01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:19.060
She says I cook an egg roll in my butthole.

977
01:07:21.810 --> 01:07:22.470
<v 4>Okay.</v>

978
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:26.550
<v 0>Why did you have to bring my mother into this conversation?

979
01:07:26.790 --> 01:07:27.790

981
01:07:34.270 --> 01:07:38.650

um,

982
01:07:39.030 --> 01:07:42.460
the video.
So let's just see if you can put together those reading English.
Yeah.

983
01:07:42.461 --> 01:07:45.190
The reading,

986
01:07:55.461 --> 01:07:58.590

Well,

987
01:07:59.490 --> 01:08:02.160
You're getting better at this.
It's weird how you're better at these.

988
01:08:02.161 --> 01:08:04.900
And the other ones just have to squint really hard and I could hear it yet.

989
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.820
<v 3>This,

01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:28.370
Very worried about that.
What she's pronouncing or the way you guys it Godzilla.

993
01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:32.780
It's in Japanese is Gojira,
but she's pronouncing the way white people would.
Oh,

994
01:08:32.790 --> 01:08:36.480

Yeah.
So in weight in Japan is not God's will.

01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:40.540
It's good euro means it's a combination of we're gorilla.

<v 0>Oh,

God Damn it.

1037
01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:54.973

01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:58.340
<v 7>Oh Man,

1039
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.903
<v 0>Wow.</v>

1040
01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.820
<v 3>Yeah.
This,
this show went way harder than the early show.</v>

1041
01:12:06.170 --> 01:12:07.003
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1042
01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:11.010
<v 7>No.
So far.
You're not doing so well at this time.</v>

1043
01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:16.000
I'm really bad with everything.
No,
no,
you're not disappointed.

1044
01:12:16.210 --> 01:12:19.810
I'm just kidding.
And this is really good.
Hey,
so I wanted to ask you this,

1045
01:12:19.850 --> 01:12:20.683
my rights fees

1046
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:24.790
<v 3>with these medical experiments,</v>

1047
01:12:25.450 --> 01:12:30.080
have you ever had any ill side effects at all?
Cause he,
wait,

1048
01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:34.030
so people know.
I mean I thought it was clear,
but just in case you don't know,

1049
01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:37.300
he signs up for like the medical testing.
So like when a new,

1050
01:12:37.330 --> 01:12:40.550
like a new medication comes out,
they have to make sure,
you know,

1051
01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:42.430
has certain side effects and

1052
01:12:43.210 --> 01:12:44.590
<v 7>time when you have medication.</v>

1053
01:12:44.591 --> 01:12:49.120
One time another itch been tried on animals and people and then,
uh,
last,
um,

1054
01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:53.600
it's funny,
it next week is five years losing my job at evil angel.
Right.
And,
um,

1055
01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:57.250
I've done,
you know,
I'm making off some money doing standup,

1056
01:12:57.251 --> 01:13:00.250
but there's time I'm low on cash.
So,
um,

1057
01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:04.660
this medical testing places look for people from Japan to try these medication

1058
01:13:04.661 --> 01:13:09.190
and yeah,
last three and a half,
four years.
I don't know.
I've done shitload of um,

1059
01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:13.420
medical testing.
Um,
the worst thing that ever happened to me is I,

1060
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:16.960
I wouldn't even say where's my shit turn into green for like two and a half

1061
01:13:16.961 --> 01:13:20.980
months.
It was like green.
Yeah.
It's a little like a Yoshi,

1062
01:13:20.981 --> 01:13:23.010
the green dinosaur coming out of my ass.
All right.

1063
01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:24.630
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1064
01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:28.890
<v 7>Did it hurt or was it loose or was it the same one?</v>

1065
01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:32.640
What was here?
Because every time we get tested by doctor they say,

1066
01:13:32.850 --> 01:13:37.260
are you experiencing any adverse effect?
Nobody would say anything.

1067
01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:40.620
Like I don't want to be the first guy to say might because I could be the only

1068
01:13:40.621 --> 01:13:42.000
one.
My Shit is turning green.

1069
01:13:42.510 --> 01:13:46.140
And then of course I told them of course then everybody and met the fact that

1070
01:13:46.170 --> 01:13:49.590
they're the,
why do I have to be the first guy to tell you my shit is green?

1071
01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:54.900
But the worst thing was I was in group one and there was a group too.

1072
01:13:54.901 --> 01:13:57.450
They're all Japanese.
Two different medication.

1073
01:13:57.810 --> 01:14:00.770
And my roommate and I were reading,
I think,
I don't think I told you I'm a,

1074
01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:03.720
maybe I'm repeating the story,
but I'm having breakfast three days later after,

1075
01:14:03.721 --> 01:14:07.470
um,
chicken in the guy we checked in,
but he was in group too.

1076
01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:12.040
He sat next to us and I look and turned orange.

1077
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:16.300
I mean he,
oh wow.
The orange spot in circular motion everywhere and his face,

1078
01:14:16.301 --> 01:14:19.750
arms,
legs.
And I asked him in Japanese like,
are your orange between the legs?

1079
01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:24.550
He goes,
hi.
Which is Japanese,
but yes.
And um,
and I don't want to laugh at him.

1080
01:14:24.551 --> 01:14:28.000
It's funny,
you know,
cause he looked like Japanese Kool aid guy walking in there.

1081
01:14:28.001 --> 01:14:28.834
Right.

1082
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:33.890
And he wants in and add insult to injury.
If you,

1083
01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:36.730
if you have adverse effects now when did you get kicked out of the study?

1084
01:14:36.731 --> 01:14:37.660
Right away you get you,

1085
01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:41.080
they make less money so you kind of fuck and like I don't know what happened

1086
01:14:41.081 --> 01:14:45.220
that they just kick all those people out of there.
Um,
we didn't have any problem,

1087
01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:49.420
you know,
that's not fair to get kicked out because of something they did.
Well,

1088
01:14:49.421 --> 01:14:52.350
I mean,
they can't continue to give them drugs.
They have to stop you.

1089
01:14:52.351 --> 01:14:57.230
They get paid.
So a minus a day.
So they didn't serve.
Yeah.
Oh Man.
Yeah.

1090
01:14:57.610 --> 01:15:01.480
But other than that,
I have a hat,
like illegal magazine.

1091
01:15:01.481 --> 01:15:06.220
I wrote a article and uh,
uh,
I'll,
I'll finally have copies for the US market,

1092
01:15:06.370 --> 01:15:10.420
but it's the story that I wrote and it's like a subculture.
It's really strange.

1093
01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:14.710
There'll be times like,
oh,
we'll go screening for study.
And I'm seeing like,
oh,

1094
01:15:14.711 --> 01:15:19.210
I remember you.
You're your liver cancer 2013.
You know,

1095
01:15:19.211 --> 01:15:21.580
when you go comedy show,
see someone sending you haven't seen for a while.

1096
01:15:21.581 --> 01:15:25.660
And so all these guys literally traveled the country doing one medical testing

1097
01:15:25.661 --> 01:15:27.370
after I just stayed in southern California.

1098
01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:31.270
But I'm in travel the country doing it.
Yeah.
It's like fight club,

1099
01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:34.120
except I call the stomach sports.
And um,

1100
01:15:34.810 --> 01:15:38.860
you literally have to have a stomach gut to do it.
But it's like,
we're like

1101
01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:44.560
blood brothers because we still our blood to make money.
Right.
So,

1102
01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:50.020
but,
but there's,
there's,
there's a lot of that medical testing places here.

1103
01:15:50.021 --> 01:15:53.050
It's called Cro,
clinical research organization.

1104
01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:56.710
And everyone's gonna be off on you.
It,
if,
you know,
if you,
if you,

1105
01:15:56.711 --> 01:15:59.490
if you need money you could comment on

1106
01:15:59.630 --> 01:16:00.980
<v 3>and it's not the worst thing I guess.</v>

1107
01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:01.913
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1108
01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:06.470
<v 3>Yeah.
Bad things can happen.
Um,</v>

1109
01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:09.410
so the worst thing you could do,
and it's true,

1110
01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:12.390
we got an email where somebody said,
uh,

1111
01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:16.660
I was watching the sopranos that somebody wrote recently.

1112
01:16:16.661 --> 01:16:20.870
It season one episode eight 45 minutes in the residents of a nursing home or

1113
01:16:20.871 --> 01:16:25.550
watching a terrible standup comedian.
I've heard of road comics,
corporate gigs,

1114
01:16:25.551 --> 01:16:28.670
et Cetera.
But I've,
I've hadn't heard of a nursing home circuit.

1115
01:16:28.671 --> 01:16:29.990
Is that a real thing?

1116
01:16:30.290 --> 01:16:33.980
Matthew writes that that is definitely a real thing.

1117
01:16:34.410 --> 01:16:38.510
The circuit a circuit occasional.
Absolutely.

1118
01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:42.980
Any place that it's possible to have a show they are,
there are shows,

1119
01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:47.370
<v 7>but they're terrible at like 1:00 PM or noon.
Oh yeah.
It's not fun to do this</v>

1120
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:51.530
<v 3>worst Gig you've had like daytime gig.
Oh my God,</v>

1121
01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:52.710
<v 7>he would is colony,</v>

1122
01:16:53.490 --> 01:16:58.440
nudist colony and everyone that you want to see naked or not naked.

1123
01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.750
And the people that you don't want to see naked,

1124
01:17:00.751 --> 01:17:04.380
they're really sit front and they're so confident they're sending like this.

1125
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:10.090
Right.
I could see their rice holes and rice

1126
01:17:10.110 --> 01:17:14.780
<v 2>hall.
Those are uncomfortable nudist colony.
Really?
Yeah.</v>

1127
01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:19.450
It's off of 10th freeway literal before you get on the 15 and a,

1128
01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:22.970
I'm not making that up.
I Wa if you gave me stage time,
I'll fucking show up.

1129
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.840
And um,
I've done those.

1130
01:17:26.841 --> 01:17:31.300
I've done women's prison.
Uh,
sounds fine.
Now they're there.

1131
01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:34.240
They're very nice.
Um,
women's thing,

1132
01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:37.010
like a halfway house when they're just out of prison.
Is that what that is?

1133
01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:39.590
Transitional home.
And I remember being like,

1134
01:17:39.591 --> 01:17:44.180
how many of you girls are married and all of them had like either like abusive

1135
01:17:44.181 --> 01:17:49.010
husbands are like,
had been put away for VI domestic violence yet.
And I was like,

1136
01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:53.900
Oh yeah.
Oh,
they're married to someone in prison as well.
So fucked up.

1137
01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:58.550
I felt so bad.
I was like,
target.
Am I right?
Like I did not relate.

1138
01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:02.990
Things are getting too exciting.
Let's dial it down.
Bring it down.

1139
01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:06.530
I'm here to talk to you today

1140
01:18:08.830 --> 01:18:13.830
or engineered grassy depressions designed to detain large volumes of storm water

1141
01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:19.840
after rain events cause wanted to play something boring for a second so I don't

1142
01:18:20.451 --> 01:18:24.620
want to do
anyway can do this one.

1143
01:18:24.621 --> 01:18:28.390
When you yellow,
when you yellow unzip the flight.

1144
01:18:28.391 --> 01:18:33.080
This is interesting.
Yeah,
yeah.
Okay.
This is really important.

1145
01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:39.380
Hi,
Mommy's email,
right?
Yeah.
My brother and I are both huge fans.

1146
01:18:39.410 --> 01:18:39.891
<v 5>The show,</v>

1147
01:18:39.891 --> 01:18:43.730
and we're talking a while ago about our yellowing habits and thought you guys

1148
01:18:43.731 --> 01:18:44.564
could weigh in.

1149
01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:49.960
We listened that some men at our jobs only unzipped the fly of their genes and

1150
01:18:50.991 --> 01:18:55.991
bring their weaner through the zipper hole button and belt still fastened to

1151
01:18:57.471 --> 01:18:58.550
yellow.
However,

1152
01:18:58.551 --> 01:19:03.551
my brother and I have corroborated that we both unzipped the fly and undo belt

1153
01:19:04.161 --> 01:19:04.570
button,

1154
01:19:04.570 --> 01:19:09.570
etc. Then take our wiener out above the waist band of our me undies,

1155
01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:16.450
thus maximizing the distance from our dicks to zipper teeth after speaking for a

1156
01:19:17.391 --> 01:19:20.120
little bit longer,
we thought it was a generational thing.

1157
01:19:20.150 --> 01:19:25.150
Both me and my brother are poly by millennials and most of the men we each work

1158
01:19:26.511 --> 01:19:28.640
with are cisgender dads.

1159
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:33.920
But even after talking with some of my likeminded millennial friends,

1160
01:19:33.921 --> 01:19:37.160
I've noticed that some of them also pull the snake through the whole,

1161
01:19:37.190 --> 01:19:42.170
like the aforementioned cisgendered dads.
Thanks.
From Charlotte,

1162
01:19:42.171 --> 01:19:43.520
North Carolina.
Nate,

1163
01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:48.040
<v 2>that is a fantastic email.
Interesting discussion.</v>

1164
01:19:48.041 --> 01:19:49.870
Really thought provoking.

1165
01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:54.850
Pulled a wiener just through the zipper or do you open it and take everything?

1166
01:19:54.851 --> 01:19:59.710
The twig and the berries out of
me.
Yeah.
Tell me.

1167
01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:01.930
I feel like it's a fuck.

1168
01:20:01.931 --> 01:20:05.320
It feels like a boss move to grab everything and drop it out.

1169
01:20:05.321 --> 01:20:09.930
So I like to the whole thing and let the whole package out.
You know,

1170
01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:12.060
I don't just weasel the story.

1171
01:20:12.090 --> 01:20:15.030
Kind of afraid of getting your penis stuck in the zipper?

1172
01:20:15.090 --> 01:20:19.170
Never really think about that.
I don't think about that.
No.
You think about that?

1173
01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:23.420
I've done that before.
Yeah.
Maybe the Zipper is difficult.
Yeah,

1174
01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:26.990
I mean who hasn't,
I guess it's happened,
but not with a free weight.

1175
01:20:26.991 --> 01:20:28.470
Do you wear boxers or underwear?

1176
01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:33.650
<v 7>Um,
what do I wait sometime I wrote him where anything,
well,
yeah,
that's,
that's,</v>

1177
01:20:33.710 --> 01:20:34.543
that would be the answer.

1178
01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:44.160
<v 2>So then it becomes a problem.
Yeah.
And those are the times when you get scared.</v>

1179
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:46.160
Scared.
Well,

1180
01:20:46.170 --> 01:20:50.990
don't your pubes get caught in your zipper to Asian people are not that hairy

1181
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.460
doe that's trail.
It's,
you know,

1182
01:20:53.610 --> 01:20:56.010
I would love to shave my body and cover you and all that.

1183
01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:57.413
<v 4>Oh,</v>

1184
01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:04.520
<v 2>we could probably sell that on something,
right?
Yeah.
We patch it on you.</v>

1185
01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:09.770
Let's do it.
I,
I'll,
I'll pay you medical testing rate.
Let's do it.

1186
01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:16.880
But you have to wear his body here.
Yeah.
And you got to where every inch of it.

1187
01:21:18.270 --> 01:21:22.620
<v 7>You know,
you know our good friend Russell Peters,
right?
Yeah.

So,</v>

1188
01:21:22.690 --> 01:21:24.240
um,
his word Indian.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1189
01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:28.110
He's got hair on top of his hair and he's a hairy dude.
Right.

1190
01:21:28.410 --> 01:21:31.350
He knows I don't like body hair.
He just,

1191
01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:33.900
he'll come up and just kind of glaze.

1192
01:21:34.370 --> 01:21:37.850
He's got w what are you fucking monkeys?
But he has,

1193
01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:43.370
he's got,

Sorry.

1194
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:52.220

Okay.
Um,
he's got here on knuckles.

1195
01:21:52.221 --> 01:21:55.940
That's disgusting.
I kept,
he just calming,

1196
01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.920
Glaze is Harry fucking hands all over me and like that I'm not into body here.

1197
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:05.600
I mean really no,
because if I have,
if I see here on my foot,

1198
01:22:05.650 --> 01:22:10.390
I was fucking shape that shut off.
Yeah.
I don't,
I don't like,
that's disgusting.

1199
01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:11.760
<v 2>So have you ever been to the hairy woman?</v>

1200
01:22:11.761 --> 01:22:12.840
Cause I know you've been with a lot of women.

1201
01:22:15.690 --> 01:22:19.220
<v 7>See sometimes there's hookers or like they deceive you because they kinda</v>

1202
01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:23.100
covered their bodies.
So you think,
oh she's not Harry and like Oh my God,

1203
01:22:23.101 --> 01:22:28.050
I just the I don't like hairy pussy.
Right.
That's a fair thing.

1204
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:31.880
No,
some of his,
some of his fine,
but you know,

1205
01:22:31.881 --> 01:22:34.890
you didn't want to look like a fucking Mr t down there.
Right.
So,
um,

1206
01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:37.370
pity the fool.
Right.
So anyway.

1207
01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:40.840
<v 2>All right,

I mean it is a matter of preference.</v>

1208

Thank you for reminding me.

Yeah.
Yeah.
He told me that once.

1211
01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:56.490
That was fucking horrible memory that I thought was gone.

1212
01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:01.970
What a great time though to be a woman.
Like the 70s,

1213
01:23:01.971 --> 01:23:04.840
the 80s do just full Bush.
Yeah.

1214
01:23:04.841 --> 01:23:09.070
You have fucking wax or think about it.

Are You Hungarian?</v>

Can I tell you something?</v>

1219
01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:30.460
Can I do something that is my great friend Steve Holmes,

1220
01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:31.750
the greatest German porn site.

1221
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:35.730
<v 0>Oh,
that should
give it up for Steve.</v>

1222
01:23:35.850 --> 01:23:37.230
Is he a strong performer?

1223
01:23:38.650 --> 01:23:42.910
<v 7>He is.
I call him the Larry Bird.
A pornography.</v>

1224
01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:45.880
I'm telling you,
I'm telling you,

1225
01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:49.210
too many young punks in this business these days,
they cheat.

1226
01:23:49.211 --> 01:23:50.800
They use medication days.

1227
01:23:50.801 --> 01:23:54.910
They put a cap or Jack that shit today and Jack Andrews in their dicks and stuff

1228
01:23:55.090 --> 01:23:59.610
and they're cheaters.
Not this man.
I saw,
I met him 15 years ago in a,
um,

1229
01:23:59.650 --> 01:24:04.650
I think it was a vns and Berlin and Barcelona erotic film festival.

1230
01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:08.920
And he was on stage live six shell fucking this women on stage.
I mean,

1231
01:24:08.921 --> 01:24:12.310

1232
01:24:12.311 --> 01:24:13.670

1235
01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:27.050

You know,
because it's not,</v>

1236
01:24:27.051 --> 01:24:30.190
it has nothing to do with his being German.
And I'm from Japan,
World War Two.

1237
01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:33.230
It has nothing to do with,

1238
01:24:36.130 --> 01:24:39.840
<v 2>So many of you picked him.

You're still working.
Oh yes.
The Germans.

1240
01:24:43.001 --> 01:24:46.690
Are they big into body here or do they,
do they embrace a full Bush?

1241
01:24:46.691 --> 01:24:47.524
Is that why you're,

1242

01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:56.260
<v 2>He said that he likes to see it coming back.</v>

1244
01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:00.080
That more and more women are full blushing.
I agree.
Fuck waxing.

1245
01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:04.660
It's so painful.
I wouldn't even wax my legs.
I wouldn't put that shit on my meow.

1246
01:25:04.690 --> 01:25:07.940
No Way.
So wait,

1264
01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:17.400
I played them twice and I still go stand down once it's in there.

1265
01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:19.580
I tried to correct somebody too.

1266
01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:23.810
I tried to correct somebody and I said it with confidence incorrectly.

1267
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:27.410
Like somebody says stem and I got it.

This is so small.

1275
01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:01.660
Would you be interested in having him on your hill?
Oh No,

1276
01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:05.050
I'm just to stay married.
You know what I mean?
Now you can have on the show.

1277

Well,

1279
01:27:12.371 --> 01:27:16.570
Are you going to send them?

A Hungarian lady.
Wow.

1281
01:27:20.231 --> 01:27:24.930

I know.
Okay.
I'm just going on.

1284
01:27:33.130 --> 01:27:38.070
What is your penis situation like?
What do you mean?
Oh,

1285
01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:42.840
like medical tests.
Does it affect it or,
okay.
Yeah.
Is that what I know the,

1286
01:27:42.850 --> 01:27:43.750
what was the question?

1287
01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:53.430
It is now.
Oh sure.
Yeah.
We weren't even going to go there.

1288
01:27:53.470 --> 01:27:56.910
Does it affect your penis?
No,
I mean I haven't,

1289
01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:01.770
I mean I'm 47 so it's not like you're 47.
Freezy great man.

1290
01:28:02.490 --> 01:28:06.210
You look great for having bureau fucking Guinea pig.
Jesus Christ.
You look great.

1291
01:28:08.670 --> 01:28:10.400
<v 7>Well,
ironically,</v>

1292
01:28:10.401 --> 01:28:14.630
I think the medical testing that force me to keep healthy because I have to

1293
01:28:14.631 --> 01:28:19.160
watch my weight,
you know,
and uh,
half to walk every day and um,
it's quiet.

1294
01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:22.950
Nobody if you,
if you want to loose weight during medical tests,
it's a,

1295
01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:27.960
one of the best way because I remember over the summer I was 31 days.

1296
01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:33.440
I was literally losing almost pound a day because the low Carolee calorie intake

1297
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:37.310
study in like,
I didn't even serve porn to whole time.

1298
01:28:37.311 --> 01:28:40.040
I was there because I was surfing for food and the W,
you know,

1299
01:28:40.041 --> 01:28:41.510
because I was thinking this is going,

1300
01:28:41.511 --> 01:28:43.520
what I'm going to eat when I get the fuck Outta here first.

1301
01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:48.540
<v 2>Now I'm going to do another weight loss contest and I'm going to go to medical</v>

1302
01:28:48.541 --> 01:28:48.950
testing.

1303
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:52.610
<v 7>You know,
you will lose weight.
I mean,
there's no way around it.
I mean,</v>

1304
01:28:52.690 --> 01:28:54.470
I a couple of times almost,

1305
01:28:55.170 --> 01:28:58.820
I got teary thinking about food because I was so hungry.
I was,

1306
01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:02.040
<v 2>yeah,
no,
I understand.
Have you seen,
uh,</v>

1307
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.230
<v 3>what's your latest prostitutes situation?</v>

1308
01:29:04.231 --> 01:29:06.570
Where have you been somewhere on a trip lately?

1309
01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:09.840
<v 7>I was in,
um,
um,
I was,</v>

1310
01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:13.590
I was in Europe for illegal magazine and we were trying to help the street

1311
01:29:13.591 --> 01:29:18.480
hookers in the Copenhagen and places like that.
But,
um,
when I was in Amsterdam,

1312
01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:23.290
I was going to,
I was supposed to get paid,
but I didn't get paid before my trip,

1313
01:29:23.291 --> 01:29:27.090
so I have very little money.
So when I was in Amsterdam,
I had little money.

1314
01:29:27.091 --> 01:29:30.900
I guess I could have gone a prostitute,
but you know,
I was so busy watching.

1315
01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:34.050
Have you ever watched that show?
Um,
bojack horseman

1316
01:29:35.670 --> 01:29:40.050
on Netflix?
That,
I'm not kidding if you haven't seen it,

1317
01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:44.820
that she made me cry.
Uh,
I watched the whole fucking thing three,
four times,

1318
01:29:44.821 --> 01:29:46.080
the whole three seasons.

1319
01:29:46.110 --> 01:29:50.790
It's telling you thing three or four times a three seasons of it.

1320
01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:54.000
I'm telling you,
I know you,
if you see a horse,
his face,
he think that's stupid,

1321
01:29:54.001 --> 01:29:55.260
but you should,
I'm telling you,

1322
01:29:55.261 --> 01:29:59.730
it's one of the greatest show ever about addiction and living in Hollywood and

1323
01:29:59.731 --> 01:30:03.500
uh,
dealing with a celebrity culture.
It's like,
no,
I'm telling you,

1324
01:30:03.501 --> 01:30:08.130
if you see it,
that shit,
it was just such a hard thing to watch,

1325
01:30:08.131 --> 01:30:10.410
but it was a,
well,
our name was just brilliant.
This,

1326
01:30:10.411 --> 01:30:13.350
it's a beautiful show and issue.
You should,
I'm telling you right.

1327
01:30:13.530 --> 01:30:16.540
I didn't even get hooker.
Oh my God.

1328
01:30:18.990 --> 01:30:23.970
<v 3>Look,
a lot of you,
uh,
have,
uh,
participated and sent in your,</v>

1329
01:30:23.971 --> 01:30:26.850
uh,
hey mommy's thanks jeans.
And they've been,

1330
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.420
every week they get better and better.
We,
uh,
we,

1331
01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:33.150
we pulled a couple to play here for you because they,

1332
01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:36.260
people have been building on them.
So I'm going to play,
uh,

1333
01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:39.150
some of the latest submissions we even had.
I can't show you here,

1334
01:30:39.151 --> 01:30:41.400
but we had a police officer do one,

1335
01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:46.460
which is fucking amazing that a cop in uniform pulled up in his police car and

1336
01:30:48.331 --> 01:30:50.370
was like,
Hi Mommy.
And then a hole,

1337
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:55.810
which we both got terrified when we saw the video come in.
We were like,
oh,
oh,

1338
01:30:55.830 --> 01:31:00.450
you're little gene nonsense,
but it's not so sure this one says,

1339
01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:01.593
<v 11>okay.</v>

With a two splendas and adult pipe classic and a little bit of one,

1358
01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:15.940
a extra shot of espresso.

1359
01:32:16.510 --> 01:32:19.180
Uh,

1364
01:32:40.210 --> 01:32:44.950
We both got diarrhea and
on our way out.

1365
01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:50.440
Well,
