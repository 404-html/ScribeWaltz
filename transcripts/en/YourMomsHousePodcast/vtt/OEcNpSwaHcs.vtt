<v 1>Christina.</v>

5
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.250
<v 0>Oh yeah,
no,</v>

6
00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:36.251
both of those rides had no wonder he wanted to give us a ride again.

7
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.990
Yeah.
We had to.

8
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.640
You had this where you have the Uber driver who's terrible,
but you're,

9
00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:46.070
you're respectful.
Like you're just like,
I'm just,
you know,

10
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.700
kind of bite your tongue.
Well,
you want to live.
Yeah.
You want to live.
Yeah.

11
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.640
I complain.
And then you're just like,
I'm not going to be a dick.

12
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.780
And then they're like,
uh,
yeah,

13
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.410
I'll give you my card and you can just hit me up directly.
And you're like,

14
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.610
for what?
For more of that shit.
I'm trying to get nauseous.
Why?

15
00:01:01.611 --> 00:01:05.150
Why would I call you?
And they're like,
this way,
we have our own relationship,

16
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.850
you know,
direct.
And I'm like,
no,
thanks.
Well,

17
00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:12.180
my favorite is that the second guy's car reeked of the Cologne.
Yeah.

18
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.460
Wanting to throw up the whole time.
My favorite also was that this guy goes,

19
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.290
you know,
who was a dick.
Yeah.
Uh,
and he talked about like a,

20
00:01:20.291 --> 00:01:23.930
a famous basketball player and I was like,
Oh really?
That's too bad.

21
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.590
Like I guess it happened.
He was like,
yeah,
it was a real asshole.
And I was like,

22
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.900
yeah,
that sucks.
He's like,
yeah,
I mean,

23
00:01:29.901 --> 00:01:33.080
I went to drop him off and I asked him to take a picture and then he was just

24
00:01:33.081 --> 00:01:35.430
like,
no.
I'm like,
wait a minute.
Yeah,
you made it sound.

25
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.950
This guy was a dick out of nowhere.

26
00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:41.100
You mean you were driving him and your professional job and then you will

27
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.310
insisted on a photo and someone didn't want it to be not in the mood because he

28
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.180
thinks he's just getting a ride to the airport as well.
Everything's,

29
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.110
he can not deal with you at the moment.
My favorite,

30
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.100
like everybody should always want to take pictures with me and said he's a human

31
00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:56.540
being.
Maybe the guy's tired.

32
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.720
Makes him feel like you're fucking taking pictures with you asshole.
Yeah.

33
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.330
Mother fucker.
Yeah.

34
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.110
This is Scorpion,

35
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.560
Scorpion produced by Mike Go.

36
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.820
I appreciate it.
I appreciate it.
Appreciate you must.
Um,

37
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.500
here's my,
uh,
my two big ads this week.
If you don't know now,
you know,

38
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.660
um,
so my Boston week,

39
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.090
I actually am going back and forth between the Shivaya and the,

40
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.530
the Wilbur,
you know,
normally you play,
do you play one or the other?
Um,

41
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.700
so if you wondered why it's the back and forth,

42
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.750
it's just because the Wilbur wasn't available.

43
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.110
Normally I would just do a Wilbur run,
you know,
like stay there.
So,
um,

44
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.090
Thursday there's two,
right?
No,
sorry.

45
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.060
Friday there's two at the Shivaya there.

46
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.780
The late shows almost sold out now to Saturday at the Wilbur.

47
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.830
We're adding a Sunday,
Jesus Christ and had at the [inaudible].
So it goes,

48
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.100
it goes,
uh,
that's how my agent says,
Hey,
is that wrong?
The French,

49
00:03:04.101 --> 00:03:08.410
it's from the Chevalier Chivalry.

50
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.790
The shovel re is going to go a on presale Wednesday.
The Code Word is Boston.

51
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:17.260
The word is Boston.
If you want to get tickets,
uh,
noon,

52
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.850
local time code word is Boston.
That's in Medford.
Um,

53
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.150
thank you so much.
Boston area has been extremely generous and kind to me.

54
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:30.010
I suggest for Boston.
Yeah,
sure.
Balls.
10.
Ballston.
Yeah.

55
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.040
Yeah.
That sounds like a really good idea.
Um,
yeah.
No,

56
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.250
it's better than what you got going.

57
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.260
It's not even how you say that city's name is balls town.
Okay.
Um,

58
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.600
the other,
the other big one I'm excited about is we,
uh,

59
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.660
we added a show in Nashville at the Ryman April 14th at 9:30 PM.

60
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.490
And what did we just talk about?
Oh,
and Louisville.
Louisville.
Uh,

61
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.540
at the Browne theater,
which I know would make you happy.
Yeah.

62
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.790
Yeah.
The ad requests that Tuesday,
May 28th.

63
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.500
It's a,
it's going on sale.
A local,

They're all there.

83
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.890

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.680
I like to give a special shout out to all the mommies who came out to fill her

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:07.010
dot delphia and to Dork titties.

I can't thank you guys.
Amazing.
It was some something special.
Really special.

96
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.750
Proud of her gene.
Very,
very excited for you.
Uh,

Really big things are happening.

98
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.840
Big Jeans are happening for you.
Big episode.
You're ready to get started,
gene.

99
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.700
Sorry.
All right,
let's start this.
It's hard to

100
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.270
fold tramadol.

101
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.320
<v 4>That's another
big Oh,</v>

102
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.950
gay person.
No,

103
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:41.543
I didn't mean that.

104
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.013
<v 1>I've seen</v>

105
00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:01.190
<v 0>and a lot of people messaging the talking trash about this water.
Why?
I Dunno.</v>

106
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.500
Maybe it's a,
well,
it's purified.

107
00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:06.530
So I think that's another thing that Martin taught us is not,

108
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.880
I don't actually drink the bottle.
The water that comes in that bottle,

109
00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:11.714
I refill it.

110
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.700
I don't like to waste the plastic and truth be told.

111
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.990
I know I bought reusable containers for water.

112
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.840
They taste like plastic.
Let's look at the marketing behind this.

113
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:25.460
What makes us essential better.

114
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:30.790
Our proprietary process turns water from any source into supercharged ionized

115
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.660
alkaline water.
It's even too pure to be tasted,
to be tested by Ph strips.

116
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.260
Ah,
let's see.
That's your tap water.
I'm drinking.

117
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:43.430
That's filtered water and he's like my house.
Yup,
you got it.

118
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.410
You got to love a guy who's angry enough to make a post.
Yes,

119
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:49.730
use a naughty word,

120
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.940
but is self aware enough to correct himself right in that moment,

121
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.570
he was so angry.
He was like,
all right,
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.

122
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:57.813
I think you'd ever hear that.

123
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:00.603
<v 4>I didn't mean that</v>

124
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.960
<v 0>you let it go.
He was like real talk.
I think in New York I may have done that.</v>

125
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.860
Wow.
Ah,
Geez.
I can't say that anymore.

126
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.350
You can't say I do the same thing as this guy sometimes.

127
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:17.143
<v 4>I didn't mean that.</v>

128
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:22.170
<v 0>You know why he looks at his upset here and I'll let him him explained.</v>

129
00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.270
This is why he's so upset.

130
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.740
<v 4>There's another gay person messages me a picture of your ass and your ass looks</v>

131
00:08:30.451 --> 00:08:35.010
like a woman's ass and I think it's a woman.
And I open it.

132
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.950
Yeah.
And I get aroused

133
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:41.220
ever fucking game.

134
00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:44.940
I'm going to kill that mother fucker.

135
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:50.940
<v 0>So apparently he's mad that he's becoming sexually aroused by men's booties that</v>

136
00:08:52.811 --> 00:08:56.220
he thinks are women's booties.
Has that ever happened to you?
Be Honest.

137
00:08:56.221 --> 00:08:59.850
Like where you're on,
you're surfing the web looking for stuff to be true.
Me Too.

138
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.210
And you're like,
this chick's hot and then you're like,
whoa,
that's not a chick.

139
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.110
Oh yeah,
for sure.
And then do you beat yourself?

140
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.780
Cause it sounds like he's really beating himself up.
He's getting himself like,

141
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:13.710
or even just having the moment,
right?
Like that's what he's right.

142
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.940
I mean I don't know who that hasn't happened too.
You've seen like,
you know,

143
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:21.780
you can see I've even seen like a,
a girl in public,

144
00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:26.630
like she's pretty and they'd be like,
oh that's a guy like Matt and non binary.

145
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:31.410
Yeah.
You'll just see like long hair and they'd be a profile and you were like,

146
00:09:31.411 --> 00:09:36.290
what's an attractive woman at a guy like that that happens for sure.
But yeah,
on,

147
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:41.370
if you're like looking on porn sites,
you can definitely get tricked,
Ya know?

148
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.000
I mean obviously they're going to advertise that,
but you can scroll,

149
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.520
you know they have like the popups and all the,

150
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.790
well I have clicked on and people have sent me,

151
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.760
you've seen the thing right where it's like someone will send you a video and

152
00:09:53.761 --> 00:09:57.060
you open it and it pants down and be like gorgeous face,

153
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:02.490
gorgeous body you'll see takes no shit.
And then they pan,

154
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:06.270
you know,
like all the way down and then like huge Dick and yeah.
Okay.

155
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.060
That's what I was just going to say is that I've accidentally clicked on

156
00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:12.330
thumbnails I thought were one direction and then you're like,
oh,
those are,

157
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.450
those are two dudes.
He makes it sound.
Let me look how angry he is here.

158
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:20.370
He makes it sound like people,
well he's saying that are sending him,

159
00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:24.360
so he's like,
you're forcing me to calm.
Well,
but I mean he's gay dudes.

160
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.630
But suddenly he said they're sending right?
Doesn't he say they're sending,

161
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.930
which means that he's,
is he being like targeted

162
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.230
messages?
Messages.

163
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.770
So someone's messaging him that means directly being like,

164
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.820
you should look at this.
Interesting.
Do you get sent those a lot?
No.

165
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.830
I know I only get,
I get,
um,
the complements,
um,

166
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:55.010
mostly from men.
You get the bear communities,

167
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.750
the gay bear community is definitely your demo.
No,
the way that I do it,

168
00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:03.600
that is kind of,
they'll be like,
um,
oh my God,
you're so funny.
I love,
you know,

169
00:11:03.601 --> 00:11:07.350
the special or the podcast and I'm like,
oh cool.
And there'll be like the,

170
00:11:07.351 --> 00:11:09.500
you're also pretty cute.
And I'm like,
all right.

171
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:14.880
Does it doesn't hurt that you're easy on the yeah,
I've gotten that.

172
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.470
I'll just wanted to set,
you're hilarious.
And also the hottest come on.

173
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.080
And I'm like,
God.
Okay.
And do you think there,
how would that upset?

174
00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:23.910
It doesn't upset me,
but I like,

175
00:11:23.911 --> 00:11:27.270
I liked their tactic because it's like I'm gonna throw it in there.

176
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.980
I'm going to just throw the hook out.
That's what guys do ever know.

177
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:34.910
If he's going to be like,
wow.
Wow,
your Q two,

178
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:39.840
that's men straight or gay.
Yes.
A matter guys.

179
00:11:39.841 --> 00:11:42.900
Just go see what happens.
Go fishing.

180
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.500
These are the guys that fish on the Santa Monica pier.
Like,
you know,

181
00:11:46.501 --> 00:11:49.560
you're not going to catch good fish,
but you're still gonna.

182
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:53.440
I'm going to throw the lines.
Yeah,
I know the straight version of that guy.
Well,

183
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.960
you know,
I'm a guy and that's true.

184
00:11:55.961 --> 00:11:59.530
And then high school and college and you always have that friend even into your

185
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:04.300
20s I would say.
Who's like,
he just compliments every woman and you're like,

186
00:12:04.301 --> 00:12:07.090
Jesus,
this incessant complementing.
Yeah,

187
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.660
but he does it because every once in a while get something going,

188
00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:15.520
I love you girl.
You're more beautiful.
And I remember one of my stars in the sky,

189
00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:20.020
he would be,
he would say what he would say this to girls were in public.

190
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.840
I was always the fucking reckless,
just staring down,
you know,

191
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:29.750
it's not antisocial.
Yeah.
And he would go,
he would go,
uh,

192
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.400
how you doing?
Or she be like,
oh,
I'm good.
How are you?
He's like,

193
00:12:32.401 --> 00:12:35.290
I'm better now that I'm talking to you.
Oh boy.
Yeah.
He's like,

194
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.470
now the whole nights making sense and shit like that.
Right.

195
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.240
How many of those girls were like,
oh my God,
you're so sweet.

196
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:46.200
He looks up with a number of them course.
Yeah,

197
00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.780
but it would be a certain type of girl if you know what I mean.
Broken.

198
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.720
Well just one who's like,
I'm down to fuck over some compliments.

199
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:57.820
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

200
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.860
I'm guessing that's interesting cause what I would say no we don't like that

201
00:13:02.861 --> 00:13:05.230
because what I liked though,
here's what I do like about him.

202
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:09.940
He had success and it was no where there's this nagging bullshit of like make

203
00:13:09.941 --> 00:13:13.030
sure you take her down to get her.
That's a tactic.

204
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:15.610
I don't even feel comfortable around that tactic when I was like,

205
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.780
when I hear guys do that,
I know it works.
It works to the insecure girl.

206
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:24.520
I was amused by my friend who would do,
he would always do the positive spin.

207
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:28.960
He would make like a seven feel like a 10 you know,

208
00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:34.330
and look at work and a few times a guy tried it.
That nagging stuff on me,

209
00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:36.570
I'm like get the fuck out.

210
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:41.580
He may be physically uncomfortable even as somebody not involved in doing it.

211
00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:46.780
Guy Was said that to me.
I literally,
I forget even what he said,
like,

212
00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.480
I don't know.
I don't,
I don't remember how,

213
00:13:49.481 --> 00:13:52.930
but I remember being approached that way and just be like,
ah,
yeah.

214
00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:58.330
Well that's what not what they want the girl to go like,
Oh yeah,
wait,

215
00:13:58.331 --> 00:14:01.990
I should wear my hair up.
Oh,
and I do like the positive approach.

216
00:14:01.991 --> 00:14:05.640
I'd rather have a guy of course better.
It's better now that you're here,
girl.

217
00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:09.790
Yeah.
He was ridiculous.
So ridiculous.
Of course.

218
00:14:09.791 --> 00:14:13.430
You know I'm talking about had a pretty good batting average.
He just,

219
00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:18.340
because he's sweet,
he's attractive.
He's,
he means no harm.
That's why that works.

220
00:14:18.341 --> 00:14:21.370
I'm working people.
He was just like,
girl,
my whole,

221
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:26.020
my whole life's changing right now.
Yeah.

222
00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:30.490
For real though.
For real though.
Like a boy band,
Huh?
God,

223
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.610
you'll deserve to be in a place like you deserve a better place.

224
00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:39.250
I've got to get you kind of Joe's tactic of him being,
like you said,

225
00:14:39.251 --> 00:14:42.840
you got to leave with your ex boyfriend.
Exactly.
Don't do that.
Don't,

226
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.660
don't look back.
Don't look back.
Well,

227
00:14:46.661 --> 00:14:49.840
I'll tell you one thing about this guy to this guy right here.
I don't think,

228
00:14:49.841 --> 00:14:51.190
I don't think he knows the Oscars.

229
00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:54.470
<v 5>Hey,
can you believe that shit?</v>

230
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.700
Can you fucking even believers know how,

231
00:14:58.701 --> 00:15:00.950
how nonsense has all this?
How much,

232
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.680
how much further is this going to go before somebody sounds,

233
00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:08.440
they hysteria keeps growing.
It is hysteria at a new law.

234
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.120
If you don't know,
um,
I'd be surprised.

235
00:15:11.121 --> 00:15:14.450
But Kevin Hart was tapped to host the Oscars.

236
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.220
Then they uh,

237
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:21.280
pulled up some eight and nine and maybe even 10 year old tweets.

238
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:26.450
Yeah.
Um,
and they were like,
these are homophobic,

239
00:15:26.451 --> 00:15:31.370
anti gay.
And it was things like,
oh here's,
let me give you,
the one of them is,
uh,

240
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:34.760
if I came home and found out my son was gay,

241
00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:39.310
I'd break a doll house over his head,
no areas.
And then they're like,

242
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.340
you're going to attack your son.

243
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.900
So I dunno what makes me the craziest about all this stuff.
I mean,

244
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:52.430
a lot of it does is when people pretend cause they're pretending,

245
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:58.120
they pretend like they don't get what part of these statements are jokes.

246
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.750
That's what makes me the craziest.
Like,

247
00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.600
or what part of it when they pretend to misinterpret it,

248
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:08.330
you know what they did it with norm Macdonald's when he did the uh,

249
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.940
his interview where he was like,
yeah,

250
00:16:10.941 --> 00:16:15.170
so I hooked up Roseanne with Louie cause they're the only two people that have

251
00:16:15.171 --> 00:16:16.700
been through something like that.
And they're like,

252
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.740
what do you mean been through something like that?

253
00:16:18.741 --> 00:16:22.360
There's victims here and it's like,
yeah,
but not the media.

254
00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.290
Understand what he was saying.

255
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:29.320
You don't need an explanation and you're purposely out pro purposely pretending

256
00:16:30.711 --> 00:16:35.480
to be outraged because that's a thing to do now and you have your target but you

257
00:16:35.481 --> 00:16:36.620
know exactly what he meant.

258
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:41.740
You know that he meant the year or two people that lost everything in a day and

259
00:16:43.011 --> 00:16:45.140
probably only know what that feels like.

260
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:49.880
I've gathered not irrespective of the other obviously.

261
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:53.280
And then with Kevin's thing,
it's like,
so he,

262
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:58.300
him threatening to break a doll house over his young sons surfaces is uh,

263
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.590
because he found that his gay,
like it might be fun,
not be funny,

264
00:17:03.591 --> 00:17:07.850
it might be Hacky,
it might be like tasteless.
But or whatever,

265
00:17:07.851 --> 00:17:10.100
but you're going to act like,
hey,

266
00:17:10.101 --> 00:17:15.101
he's probably going to really hurt his son like that.

267
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.450
That's so exhausting that I have to,

268
00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.260
because I know that even if you are outraged that you know that that's a joke.

269
00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:26.560
So now we're doing this Improv in public together where I'm going to acknowledge

270
00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:28.783
that I,

271
00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:33.890
I understand your outrage now I understand what you mean because he really

272
00:17:34.071 --> 00:17:39.071
shouldn't hurt his son for saying that he was going to be gay or has apologized

273
00:17:40.881 --> 00:17:44.330
already and that was his point.
And secondly,
he's already addressed it.

274
00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.090
It's the corporations who acknowledge these.
First of all,

275
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:49.830
if you talk to the average person on the street,

276
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:54.090
<v 3>I don't see anybody outraged.
I don't think most people give a shit.</v>

277
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.970
It's these weird marginal groups,

278
00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:00.570
I guess on the Internet that are coming after these corporations.

279
00:18:00.571 --> 00:18:03.570
And then the corporations kowtow to this lunacy.
So if the,

280
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.940
whoever's hiring Kevin just goes,
oh really?

281
00:18:05.941 --> 00:18:08.760
You're upset too bad Kevin Hart's our guy.
Yeah.

282
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:13.140
Instead of like exactly appeasing these Donnie's.
That's why it's ridiculous.

283
00:18:13.141 --> 00:18:15.900
You really got to celebrate Kevin for nothing,
of course.

284
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.160
And also you know what's happening too I think is a lack of context.

285
00:18:20.161 --> 00:18:24.510
Like what you're saying is that people are taking things out of context.

286
00:18:24.511 --> 00:18:26.670
It's kind of the way we read tweets.

287
00:18:26.671 --> 00:18:31.200
You only read a hundred and whatever characters and completely out of context of

288
00:18:31.201 --> 00:18:35.370
space and time.
It's like,
it's like a comedian's doing,
you know,

289
00:18:35.371 --> 00:18:38.520
anti wife jokes or whatever the fuck in the fifties you're going to hold all

290
00:18:38.521 --> 00:18:41.250
those guys responsible or,
yeah.
It's just silly.

291
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.210
<v 5>I mean exactly like 10 years is a big difference and it really,</v>

292
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.890
it is in this era for sure.
It is for sure.
It is.
I mean,
when,

293
00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.910
when he made that tweet,
like,
you know,
again,
it could be tasteless and not,

294
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:57.530
not funny or kind of offensive,
but like it's a different time.

295
00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:00.260
It's before we had legalized gay marriage.

296
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:04.010
So his tweet,
okay,
here's the Yo,

297
00:19:04.011 --> 00:19:06.530
if my son comes home and tries to play with my daughter's doll house,

298
00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.210
I'm going to break it over and set his head and saying,
my voice stop.
That's gay.

299
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:16.490
Hmm,
okay.
Uh,
then he,
he was,

300
00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:20.330
he caught,
his son is then three old son having a gay moment.
He was not proud of,

301
00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:24.890
you should nip it in the bud.
He said,
and then in a 2011 routine,

302
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:26.600
I remember they're just waiting.

303
00:19:26.601 --> 00:19:30.800
They're just waiting for you to get certain opportunities.
Yes.

304
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.360
And then here's the thing,

305
00:19:32.361 --> 00:19:37.310
you need somebody in Kevin Hart's position who literally doesn't need it.

306
00:19:37.311 --> 00:19:39.770
Like there's some times when you're tapped to host something like that where

307
00:19:39.771 --> 00:19:43.340
you're like,
this kind of put me out front again.
Like it doesn't need,

308
00:19:43.341 --> 00:19:46.520
it doesn't need it for the attention.
Right.
Doesn't need it for the promotion,

309
00:19:46.521 --> 00:19:50.710
doesn't need it for the money.
Like they're lucky to have him,
you know,
um,

310
00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.630
for you to be in that position and be like,

311
00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.880
I'm not going to do the apology thing.

312
00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.590
<v 3>It's huge.
We need more comedians to be like,
I'm not fucking apologizing.
Fire me.</v>

313
00:19:59.591 --> 00:20:00.150
Go get hand.
Right.

314
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:03.130
<v 5>Godspeed of,
do whatever the fuck you wanted me to do.
Not doing it right.
He said,</v>

315
00:20:03.131 --> 00:20:06.760
you know,
it's come up before,
which it has he,
he did,
he addressed it in,
in a,

316
00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:10.140
I think it was a rolling stone interview a few years ago.
It's

317
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.050
<v 3>so stupid.
Well,
um,</v>

318
00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:15.490
we need to stop apologizing as comedians and also,

319
00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:20.050
I'm not sure the apology gets you anything anymore because you apologize and

320
00:20:20.051 --> 00:20:24.790
then you're probably still going to get fired anyways.
Yeah.
So now apologizing.

321
00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:26.380
It serves no purpose.

322
00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:29.440
I think we should do it with Donald Trump is great at doing,

323
00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:34.360
which he never apologizes and that's actually a really smart move.

324
00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:36.370
He doesn't,
he's like a fuck you.
Well,
look at him.

325
00:20:36.371 --> 00:20:40.720
He gets away with murder in the media.
I'm saying,
cause he's like,
no,
fuck you.

326
00:20:40.721 --> 00:20:43.660
This is what I'm doing.
And in a way I respect that because it's like,
okay,

327
00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:48.070
that's the tactic.
Don't apologize because you,

328
00:20:48.071 --> 00:20:52.300
why are we rewarding these marginal a idiots who aren't,

329
00:20:52.301 --> 00:20:56.440
who aren't understanding things contextually.
It's just silly.

330
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:59.620
It's this is absurdity.
What's happening.
It's totally,

331
00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:03.670
it's a fucking stupid witch hunt.
It's a social justice warrior,
which hunt.

332
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:08.020
I'm just happy.
The dumbest thing in the fucking world.
He did like after he,

333
00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:12.610
<v 5>um,
step down,
he sent out an Nepal.
Like you're like,
hey,</v>

334
00:21:12.611 --> 00:21:16.630
if I ever heard anyone I never meant to cause he did it on his terms after

335
00:21:16.631 --> 00:21:20.090
giving up the Gig,
he was like,
I'm not going to do it on your terms.
Um,

336
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:23.260
<v 3>but rest assured there's no comedian.</v>

337
00:21:23.261 --> 00:21:28.210
I've never met a comedian in the history of comedians whose intent is to hurt

338
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:32.020
people's feelings.
That's never the fucking intent.
No,
I know.

339
00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:36.550
That's not what anybody picks up a microphone and sacrifices everything in your

340
00:21:36.551 --> 00:21:41.410
life for a decade just to get paid a nominal amount of money to tell jokes if

341
00:21:41.411 --> 00:21:44.050
people to hurt them.
That's not why we do this.
Right.
Tom,

342
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:48.010
did you travel across the country and go into severe debt for a decade?

343
00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.610
Miss Birthdays,
holidays,
New Year's,

344
00:21:51.611 --> 00:21:55.990
everything to make people pissed off.
That's why you did comedy,
right?

345
00:21:55.991 --> 00:21:58.090
To offend gay people to,
God forbid,

346
00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:00.370
it's just the stupidest fucking thing in the world.

347
00:22:00.371 --> 00:22:03.730
I don't know why they're coming after comics.
It bothers me.
I know it,

348
00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:08.710
but I also like the gravity that people attached to the jokes too.

349
00:22:08.711 --> 00:22:12.330
Like when people are like,
you know what's fucking dumb dummies,

350
00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:15.280
we'll get back on track.
He just,
we just need,
you know,

351
00:22:15.281 --> 00:22:18.730
you gotta you gotta be like,
I screwed up there.
I don't think you do.

352
00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:21.990
Here's what we're going to put on the death list.
Remember we had the,
the,
the,

353
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.140
the person,
uh,

354
00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:28.170
we're going to execute the who listened to videos loudly or make calls loudly.

355
00:22:28.661 --> 00:22:32.190
Yeah,
it's in my act.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well I have a list of he bomb.

356
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:34.000
I want to kill and it's going to go,

357
00:22:34.001 --> 00:22:36.160
this isn't going to be the next people who don't understand.

358
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:41.210
<v 5>Yeah.
Fucking jokes.
Yeah.
Are you kidding me?
It's,
it's,
it's embarrassing.</v>

359
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:44.630
It really is embarrassing.
It's embarrassing that,

360
00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:49.520
that the culture has evolved at that point.
You know,
that,
um,

361
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:51.020
that everyone,

362
00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.870
cause you know what it is also that that's really annoying is that it's

363
00:22:53.871 --> 00:22:55.100
selective outrage.

364
00:22:55.460 --> 00:23:00.460
So if you're going to attack having heart per pass tweets and things said,

365
00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:05.360
it's not fair that it's just about gay stuff.
You got to get it.

366
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:08.450
You got to get it all.
Otherwise you're,
you're not being fair.

367
00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.450
You're being biased.
I mean,
has it,
he probably,
I don't know,

368
00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.920
made fun of a people,
I don't know

369
00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:19.570
<v 3>different ways.
And we all have,
it's all on the cattle.
But why me?</v>

370
00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.500
Why is this the only thing to be outraged by it?
I don't know.

371
00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:23.750
Gotta be outraged by all of it.

372
00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.460
There's so many great comedians that have made fun of all these things.

373
00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.820
It's all these things that really is,

374
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:34.870
<v 5>podcasting is the most amazing thing because you have no boss.</v>

375
00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:36.400
Nobody can tell you anything

376
00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:39.700
<v 3>in our audience.
Our audience gets it.
I mean,</v>

377
00:23:39.701 --> 00:23:42.610
it's clearly because we talk about the stuff.
We make fun of everything.

378
00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:45.920
And I know I just really want to Kevin Hart

379
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:49.700
<v 5>for doing that.
He's like,
I'm not playing the game.
No,
that's stupid.</v>

380
00:23:49.701 --> 00:23:53.640
I'm not playing the game for him.
Yeah.
Um,
and so yeah,

381
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:56.880
last night we did something we've never done.
Yeah.

382
00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:02.150
We went to the Lakers,
Lakers,
Lowe's lagers,
Omi.

383
00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:07.040
We set it up with our,
uh,
was actually,
we were treated by our agent,

384
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:11.510
Asian genes and agent jeans

385
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:17.900
came,
uh,
took us to the game and we saw a great game.

386
00:24:17.901 --> 00:24:20.720
We saw Lebron Dwayne Wade play in the last time.

387
00:24:20.721 --> 00:24:23.870
They'll face each other or at least the last time Dwayne Wade would play at

388
00:24:23.871 --> 00:24:27.230
staples.
He's retiring at the end of the season and you know,

389
00:24:27.231 --> 00:24:31.160
seeing a legendary player and person and here's the thing that I was thrilled
by.

390
00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:34.880
My wife fucking always rolls her eyes at sports,

391
00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:39.260
hates most of the sports and she was like,
we got to go to a Laker game.

392
00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:40.430
You had a good time.

393
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:44.480
<v 3>I love it.
I like basketball.
I grew up playing basketball here and there.</v>

394
00:24:44.481 --> 00:24:45.770
I grew up playing basketball.

395
00:24:45.771 --> 00:24:50.210
I mean like I was tall as a girl and so I actually was decent at playing

396
00:24:50.211 --> 00:24:53.420
basketball.
I didn't play it.
I couldn't believe it.
You're like,

397
00:24:53.421 --> 00:24:56.180
that's a traveling call.
I was like,
fuck.
Where have you been?

398
00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.980
The one thing I know I like going to go to basketball game again.
Yeah.

399
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.570
I like tennis too.
We can get tennis tickets.

400
00:25:02.571 --> 00:25:06.220
I don't know to fuck Dan is decades or years.

401
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:10.770
You know what I love most about the Laker game though?
Yeah,
it's the audience.

402
00:25:10.771 --> 00:25:12.830
Yeah.
When they put the camera on,

403
00:25:12.831 --> 00:25:17.780
like the dude who it just made his fucking year to be up on the jumbo tron and

404
00:25:17.781 --> 00:25:22.070
he's like,
oh,
it's really almost look at TV.
Like it's the best moment.

405
00:25:22.071 --> 00:25:24.840
Lose their shit.
They go nuts dude.
They just love it.
Well we

406
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.890
<v 5>saw it.
I mean that was,
it was down to the wire that game and we saw amazing.</v>

407
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:32.460
I mean everything from just beautiful basketball,
you know,

408
00:25:32.461 --> 00:25:36.210
like something just really coming together.
Pass Pass Pat.
We saw amazing passes.

409
00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.900
We saw kind of blooper plays.
We saw alley,
oops.

410
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:43.950
You saw guys driving and the whole beautiful threes and it was back and forth,

411
00:25:43.951 --> 00:25:45.090
back and forth.
It was,

412
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:48.140
it was like a high drama sound like an announcer with all the,
well,

413
00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:51.870
I mean we just got to see so many cool aspects of the game.

414
00:25:51.871 --> 00:25:55.080
It was actually a really good guy.
I,
yeah,
and I never seen a game live.

415
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:58.620
Like I've never been to staples center.
Actually.
I'm embarrassed to say.
Well,

416
00:25:58.621 --> 00:26:03.570
this is an interesting thing because somebody wrote in,
oddly enough,

417
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:07.980
an email about something that I wanted to bring to your attention.
Okay.
Okay.

418
00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.490
Somebody wrote in,
I have a question for the mommies.
I says,
actually,

419
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.960
hey Theodore and Caroline,

420
00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:16.380
I have a question for the Mommy and Caroline and dad's really morphed and now

421
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:20.670
I'm watching the Florida state basketball game right now with my man and I see

422
00:26:20.671 --> 00:26:24.290
how demonically tall number 21 [inaudible].

423
00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:29.130
I tell him,
I bet he can't do a lot of things like riding a car,

424
00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:33.540
take a group picture,
fit in the shower,
get on a plane,
et cetera.

425
00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:35.310
The first thing he says,

426
00:26:35.311 --> 00:26:39.420
meaning her man did to her is I bet his dick is huge.
Yeah.

427
00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:44.100
I told him he is gay and to go jack his friends four strokes

428
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:48.930
<v 3>and he said that is every man's first thought when they see a really tall guy.</v>

429
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.790
Is this Ma,
is this true?

430
00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:55.590
Are All men a little gay inside love to all my mother's keeping it high and

431
00:26:55.591 --> 00:27:00.120
tight from Kansas.
Lauren,
well Lauren,
I got to tell you something.

432
00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:04.170
Your man is 100% correct.

433
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:09.690
First thing I think about when I meet most guys is I wonder how big his dick is.

434
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:12.240
No,
but definitely a huge guy.
Well,

435
00:27:12.241 --> 00:27:16.380
when I see a bunch of big dudes running back and forth on the court,

436
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:19.920
that is first when I think of,
and then I compare their Dick Sizes in my head.

437
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:20.933
Yeah.

438
00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:25.240
And I think Lebron's got the biggest dick just because he's the king of bad

439
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:29.090
energy.
Oh,
he's got a lot of big to counter just,
but I dunno.

440
00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:33.630
I mean it's Kinda hard to,
here's the guy that she was talking about.
Okay.

441
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:39.030
This guy right here and he's got a huge one.
He's seven four.
That's crazy.

442
00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:44.340
Seven these guys,
I mean,
yeah,
these guys are big.
Look at this.

443
00:27:44.341 --> 00:27:45.174
I mean,
yeah.

444
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.840
I mean if you look at his leg is probably as Dick's probably right around here.

445
00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:55.100
Do you think his balls are big in proportion to his penis or it's just a long

446
00:27:55.171 --> 00:28:00.120
deck and the normal size balls to the balls get bigger too?
Yeah,

447
00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:02.160
I think so.
I think the ball proportion,

448
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:07.190
I don't think it would be like a 10 inch dick and then little tiny balls.

449
00:28:07.471 --> 00:28:09.240
No,
I think it's probably proportionate.
Yeah.

450
00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.160
Do you want to know something crazy gene?

451
00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.370
But I had a dream last night that you and I were doing it,

452
00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:20.070
but that you had a big black dog.
Isn't that crazy?

453
00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:22.230
Like you were you,
you were Tom colored

454
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:28.291
and then your,

455
00:28:28.291 --> 00:28:33.291
but you're dong was like a big black one and I swear it's because I was watching

456
00:28:33.391 --> 00:28:37.000
the Lakers and I was like,
there's not one white guy on this team.
Right?

457
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:39.910
There's like there's no Larry Bird and you're just like plastic black dick plans

458
00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:44.490
all the time.
I was like,
what do you think most of it was?

459
00:28:44.491 --> 00:28:48.420
Must have been an uncommon,
no,
it was an unconscious the table.
Now tell me

460
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:56.030
where are you?
No,
I've never dated a black guy.

461
00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:58.080
I never really knew.
Why were you sitting there?
They can't

462
00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:04.680
pass the ball,
pass it.
But I was thinking,
you know,

463
00:29:04.681 --> 00:29:09.120
and I was thinking because they run fast.
You were thinking,
what's going on here?

464
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:13.530
I didn't know him.
Those loose shorts,
they're dongs flop.
Well No,

465
00:29:13.531 --> 00:29:16.950
they weren't tight compressions underneath.
Oh they do?
Of course.

466
00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:18.780
Otherwise it would be just be a dick and ball fast.

467
00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:21.630
That's what I was thinking about is how do they run with their Dicks,

468
00:29:21.631 --> 00:29:25.720
wet and tight compression shorts.
They're dicks are real issue sprinters.
Sure.

469
00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:29.540
Yeah.
Big Old Dixon balls and they have to tuck them away sometimes.

470
00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:33.750
Sometimes you see them flopping and sprinting.
That's what I'm saying.
You see,

471
00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.420
cause I've seen guys playing basketball like in high school,

472
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.530
those swing and they flop and you seen them.

473
00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:43.420
But in the pros they're dicks are too big and their balls up too floppy and they

474
00:29:43.421 --> 00:29:48.110
wear compression shorts.
Yeah.
Otherwise it just be dicks everywhere.

475
00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:49.630
Yeah.

476
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:54.580
What they're digging balls smell like after a game it probably smell stinky.

477
00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.370
Yeah.
Especially for telling me that.

478
00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:58.990
You're just figuring yourself this stuff at night.
Huh?

479
00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:00.850
Were you just like trying to go to bed?

480
00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:09.430
Come on,
show me the compression pants.

481
00:30:09.431 --> 00:30:14.290
Are they porous or are they sweaty?
So it's probably not good for your junk.

482
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:17.310
Yeah,
the,
yeah.
Yeah,
for sure.
It's not that breathable.

483
00:30:17.311 --> 00:30:20.510
I'm sure your dick and balls probably smell really bad after it.

484
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.240
It's a really interesting details to bring up your Dick and balls.

485
00:30:25.241 --> 00:30:29.350
Probably do smell really bad after a game.
Maybe we can get some confirmation.

486
00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.010
Anybody play on the NBA?

487
00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.390
Any of any NBA players out there when it confirm what your dick and balls smell

488
00:30:34.391 --> 00:30:37.690
like after a game.
I like to know now.

489
00:30:37.691 --> 00:30:42.610
I grew up in the era of [inaudible] and Kobe and I never,

490
00:30:42.611 --> 00:30:44.650
unfortunately I never got to see them live play.

491
00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:48.850
I did watch the Games on television.
I saw Jill Dan Place live three times.
No,

492
00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:54.090
Michael Jordan.
I saw this on the bowls.
Wasn't he on the,
he was on the car goals.

493
00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:58.750
He was,
I got to see Shequila play.
Um,
that goes massive.

494
00:30:58.751 --> 00:31:01.810
I got to see him play early in his career when he played for Orlando.

495
00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:06.700
I went to games there.
Orlando check.
He'll probably has a huge dick and well,

496
00:31:06.701 --> 00:31:09.440
there's been stories.
It's interesting that you bring that up.
It's,

497
00:31:09.441 --> 00:31:12.910
it's interesting that you bring that up because what happened was there were

498
00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:17.640
many stories about the fact that chuck,

499
00:31:17.641 --> 00:31:21.090
we lay check Quila this enormous man

500
00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:26.000
<v 5>seven one,
you know,
at some shit now he's probably three 50 but you know,</v>

501
00:31:26.001 --> 00:31:31.001
he played in his prime at u seven one just over 300 and just gigantic giant

502
00:31:33.081 --> 00:31:36.290
human being.
And there was like some,
some hoes,
you know,

503
00:31:36.291 --> 00:31:39.770
something like video hose and stuff that were like his dick ain't all that,

504
00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.310
that his dick was not proportionate to what you were seeing.
Again,

505
00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:48.500
what might be happening is that this guy is so big,
right,

506
00:31:48.501 --> 00:31:53.501
that you're expecting a fucking tree fall out and it might be actually big

507
00:31:53.541 --> 00:31:56.300
compared to any average size guy.
Right.

508
00:31:56.330 --> 00:32:01.330
But not big compared to what you're looking at.
Meaning meaning horse,

509
00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:05.780
there's not proportionate.
So maybe he has an eight inch Dick,

510
00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:08.720
which is definitely above average,
but you're like,

511
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:11.100
I thought this thing was going to be 16 you know?
Yeah.

512
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:15.950
That's what I would expect from Shakeel.
What'd you tell him that if you met him,

513
00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.170
wouldn't you want to see it if you met him?

514
00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:22.080
<v 3>Yes,
I,
yes,
absolutely.
And I want who was,
I didn't know yet.</v>

515
00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:25.400
So many Black Hawk fantasy.
Oh please.
Who is,

516
00:32:25.401 --> 00:32:29.120
it was a magical Johnson there last night.
No,
no.
The other girl,
he was there.

517
00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:33.650
What's his name?
The old,
they're the old Kareem.
Kareem Abdul Jabbar.
He was there.

518
00:32:33.651 --> 00:32:36.410
Yeah,
he's a shit now.
I grew up watching him as a kid cause he,
they,

519
00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:40.360
they used to wear the short shorts back.
I picture his Dick Polite,
kind of uh,

520
00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:45.200
Kareem's.
Yeah,
no,
it's an,
it's an assaulter.
You think that's a big hog.

521
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.620
I bet you creams.
You got the biggest dick of,
of all of them really?

522
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.010
Just because he's long and lean.
Well,
they're all long and lean not Shaquille.

523
00:32:52.011 --> 00:32:54.800
Shaquille is meat and cheese tall and he's meat and cheese.

524
00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.250
It's built like a football player in most basketball players or lean long and

525
00:32:58.251 --> 00:33:03.140
lean.
Yeah.
Like the Harlem Globe trotters.
They all have long lean ones.

526
00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.780
How do you know this?
I don't know.
My mom dated them.

527
00:33:05.781 --> 00:33:09.830
I swear to God all of them now know she,
she had,
if she dated a few of them,
what?

528
00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:13.610
Yeah,
my mother,
I see you.
I promise you.
When she came to the country,

529
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.080
she was cute,
blonde,
big tits,
and she worked over at universal.
I swear to God,

530
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:21.500
and one day I was going through her belongings and she had all these signs.

531
00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:22.480
Oh my God.
Okay.

532
00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:29.103
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

533
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:33.530
<v 3>I'm trying to tell you a fucking story to the story saying that's my mom</v>

534
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:39.290
with the globe trotters.
She had all these signs.
It would be easy.

535
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:42.830
All these signs,
pictures of the globe.
Globe trotters.
Yeah.

536
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:44.423
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

537
00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.640
<v 3>and they're all like to eat if you know you're the best,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.</v>

538
00:33:47.641 --> 00:33:48.091
And I was like,

539
00:33:48.091 --> 00:33:50.660
how the fuck did you get all these pictures of these globe trotter?

540
00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.120
So ranches that I knew them,
I was friends with them.

541
00:33:54.121 --> 00:33:58.910
I went out on a couple of days.
I was like,
yeah,
couple of Ding Dong dates.
Yeah,

542
00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:03.760
<v 6>I got it.</v>

543
00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:08.130
<v 3>Thank you.
So nasty.
Okie dokie.</v>

544
00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:15.540
<v 2>No Dude,

545
00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.090
dude,

546
00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:22.453
<v 6>Oh,</v>

547
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:27.540
<v 3>number curly.
Curly was a short one.
Yeah.</v>

548
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:30.850
Now did they still have the Harlem Globe trotters?
Yeah,
they still do that today.

549
00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:34.530
Yeah,
that'd be fine.
We should see them next.
Yeah.
Anyways,

550

genuine,

551

I got two glasses of Chardonnay last night.

552
00:34:42.451 --> 00:34:46.260
I had a pretzel.
Yeah,
so it was a lot of fun.
There was a lot of fun.

553
00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:50.280
There was a fucking ass hole next to us who was loudly rooting for the other

554
00:34:50.281 --> 00:34:52.770
team and it fucking so disrespectful.

555
00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:55.740
He was like really rooting for them and I was like,
motherfucker,

556
00:34:55.741 --> 00:34:59.100

Sit down.
He was wearing like a fucking suit,

557
00:34:59.101 --> 00:35:03.590
like a Douche bag.
Get outta here man.
You know it's funny.
Last week my,

558
00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:06.900
one of my favorite moments when we had done again on was when you and I just

559
00:35:06.901 --> 00:35:10.830
looked at each other when he said,
I know what you're going to say.
It was like a,

560
00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:13.500
I know what you're going to say.
Oh,
and hold on,
let me get this right.

561
00:35:13.501 --> 00:35:17.970
I know what he did.
I know.
I know what he did it Christine,
right.

562
00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:22.850
I know what the fuck is.
Okay.
Christine,
can I tell you?
I just said,

563
00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:25.620
it's okay.
Christine.

564
00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:29.880
Christine and I been getting emails and people,

565
00:35:29.881 --> 00:35:32.160
people who've known me for a year,
and you're like,
hey,
Christine.
I'm like,

566
00:35:32.161 --> 00:35:36.030

It's going on.
I know.

Yeah.</v>

568
00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:42.740
Christian doesn't find out about it or,
sorry,
Christina.
Yeah.
So he,

569
00:35:42.741 --> 00:35:45.120
he did go get it right.
He corrected.
Yeah.

570
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:49.170
Do you think he remembered or he heard me say it.
Maybe.

571
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.050
Maybe I said like Christina and he was like,
oh,
got to ask him.

572
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:55.100
But he definitely had a Christine,
Christine,

573
00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:58.650
Christine [inaudible]. [inaudible] [inaudible].
Yup.

574
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.910
Yup.
Uh,
one of my favorite things,

575
00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:07.480
I usually don't bring this stuff up.
Uh,

576
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:11.160
two people that can do it because I think you've told it to mean you're like,

577
00:36:11.161 --> 00:36:14.730
everyone really hurt them.
Well,
when people are like,
dude,

578
00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:20.420
you look just like my friend or brother or dad or husband,

579
00:36:20.521 --> 00:36:25.260
and you're like,
look at the photo.
And you're like,
no,
I don't.
No,
I don't.

580
00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.860
You,
uh,
you just show me a guy with a beard.
And they're like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

581
00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:33.000
You guys are twins and so,
but now when it's a friend who does that,

582
00:36:33.001 --> 00:36:37.320
you can be like,
oh,
I can call him out.
So Brendan Schaub hosted this last week.

583
00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:38.941
Hey,
fun fact.

584
00:36:38.941 --> 00:36:43.410
Did you know my barber is Thomson [inaudible] Mexican brother and then here's

585
00:36:43.411 --> 00:36:47.530
the guy
just like him.
No.

586
00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:50.130
Well,
I put fun fact.

587
00:36:50.131 --> 00:36:54.630
Did you know that Brendan Shab has experienced severe head trauma and doesn't

588
00:36:54.631 --> 00:36:57.810
know what his friends look like because I felt like he was the first person that

589
00:36:57.811 --> 00:37:02.730
I could really lay into for this thing.
Brendon,
it's not just a guy with a beard.

590
00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:06.570
That's always what it is.
That's always what it is.

591
00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:10.410
I would say one out of a hundred of these that I get,

592
00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:15.000
is it somebody that I remotely look like?
I mean,

593
00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:19.440

His short hair.
He's got short hair,

597
00:37:33.451 --> 00:37:37.590
but that's really it.
He looks like James Gandolfini this guy more.
Um,

598
00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:42.660
how about this guy?
What are you talking about?
Look at it.

601
00:37:49.381 --> 00:37:53.970

She's holding a child and you're obsessed with the black hawks of the MBA.

634
00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.790
There you are.
There.

So do you dream about big black boobs?
Um,
I've,

638
00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:19.510
I've dropped about all types of,

639
00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:24.880
of sized tits and asses and everything I had.
My ass is terrible.

640
00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:30.960
It's disgusting.
Jesus.
It's always been disgusting.
Now there's,

641
00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:36.330
there's things really developing in this sector to Juliette.

642
00:40:36.331 --> 00:40:38.920
Oh Man.
You're telling me,
oh my goodness.

643
00:40:38.921 --> 00:40:42.340
So it's grown and grown and we're so thrilled about that.

644
00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:44.880
Lots of photo shops,

645
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:50.320

646
00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:52.510

as we're asking for when we put them out,

647
00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:55.610
they were such a hit that I have socks coming next week.
Um,

648
00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:57.520
those are good morning Julia socks.

649
00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:02.760
And I did a small and larger ones because I know that women would want some,

650
00:41:03.221 --> 00:41:07.990
but it's been,
it's,
it's the hit of the century,
Julia.
I mean,

651
00:41:07.991 --> 00:41:12.060
look,
we never know.
You never really know what resonates with the autonomy.

652
00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:13.590
So happy when it's shit like that.

653
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:18.730
There's something so pure about this whole thing with Julia and Joe.

654
00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:24.790
We got to meet Julia.
I know.

I love these more than life.

660
00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:51.690
That's a kid.
It's a kid.
Um,
here's another lady,
Julia.

661
00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:56.270
Anyway,
yesterday it was the best day of my life.
You see this?

662
00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.433
See that?

663
00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:06.700
Not shock the show.
Hey,

664
00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:10.610
Don't go back that X.

665
00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:14.540
come on and I love you.
Good morning.

666
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:19.270
Good Morning Julia.

667
00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:23.930
I just want to say we'll be having a great day.

668
00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:27.913
Sorry about debt.

669
00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:31.400
That's why I say when I'm pouring up for about three or four hours today,

670
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:34.020
really going for Toronto,
thinking about Joe.

671
00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:36.980
So open up your heart and hope to hear from y'all

672
00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:42.680
always against me.
Hey,
tripped over a fan there.
Hit the floor,

673
00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:45.443
he goes,

674
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:49.490
there's different parts of Good Morning Julia that I fixate on every now and

675
00:42:49.491 --> 00:42:50.570
then.
But I,

676
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:54.950
what I've been hearing in my head lately is open up your heart and your arms to

677
00:42:54.951 --> 00:42:59.951
me that you start having that loop.

678
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:06.060
Different loops we'll play.
Yeah,
I get that too.
What are you living?
Um,

679
00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:10.400
open up your heart and your arms to me heart and arms is a big one.

680
00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:14.030
We'll put up your heart because it's also like open your heart and then he's

681
00:43:14.031 --> 00:43:18.710
like,
and the choice of words.
Yeah,
it's very odd.
You know,

682
00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:19.893
put up your heart.

683
00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:24.050
Cause I thought first I thought it was open up your heart and your arms.

684
00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.990
Oh and then I'm like oh no,
he's saying and your arms,
your arms.

685
00:43:26.991 --> 00:43:29.030
And it's also like he was saying like be sweet,

686
00:43:29.031 --> 00:43:33.770
but he's like also be physical because that's really what put up your heart is

687
00:43:33.771 --> 00:43:36.080
an emotional thing.
But also,
yeah,

688
00:43:36.081 --> 00:43:39.170
he meant to say open up your heart and your legs or whatever's in between your

689
00:43:39.171 --> 00:43:43.360
legs.
I'll open that up for you.
Right,

690
00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:47.540
because on the surf,
I love this analysis.
You're right on the surface,

691
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:52.910
this charming just open up your heart.
But then he layers in the hyper sexual,

692
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:54.740
it was his brand.
He didn't even,

693
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:58.490
he wasn't even able to stop his brain doing that cause that's every man.

694
00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:02.510
Even like when a man is like,
let me get the door for you.
You know,
he's thinking,

695
00:44:02.511 --> 00:44:05.750
let me open your legs for you.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.

696
00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:10.040
You guys are horrible people.
Men are horrible.
Just wired for this.

697
00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.650
You guys are terrible.
Terrible.
That is true.

698
00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:15.560
Was there ever a time when you're just a normal,
not sexual.

699
00:44:15.561 --> 00:44:17.330
They go on your way out.
When you're dying,

700
00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:21.500
that's when they get even perverted again.

701
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:25.460
George Bush was slapping David Copperfield.
Anyway,

702
00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:30.850
open up your hot and you're on more on Julia meet.

703
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.860
<v 7>Meet you last night of my,
my big ass stadium pool.</v>

704
00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:38.860
Often you get physical with my music on the best days of my life.
And uh,

705
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:41.610
now you said you wanted to get back together with Gx,
but uh,

706
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:44.220
me and miss Yearwood would love to go full throttle with you down here.

707
00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:49.840
A studio g I wrote all my own songs from Rodeo to have a kind of thunder roll

708
00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:54.540
all the way down to friends in low places.
All right.
Jt Song you want to yeah,

709
00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:58.670
just uh,
coming to as many shows as you can.
No,

710
00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:00.343
Flower

711
00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:02.923
<v 8>kisses.</v>

712
00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:09.790
No trace.

713
00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:18.133
<v 6>Okay.</v>

714
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:23.260
<v 7>What's really neat about this guy is that he meshes two of our favorite things</v>

715
00:45:23.261 --> 00:45:28.090
together.
Garth and Joe.
Two greatest guys of all time.
Joe Brooks.

716
00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:32.010
Yeah.
What a nightmare.
Julie.
Yeah.

717
00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:36.760
<v 9>No,
you like a strong man.
Not like your ex boyfriend.</v>

718
00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:40.010
I just wanted to show you the ceiling fan and,

719
00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:44.620
and show to you how strong this ceiling fan is.
Demonstrate.
Oh Shit.

720
00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:49.690
So we can,
when you will not go full throttle,
Juliet,

721
00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:54.460
I think you would really take things serious.
Oh my God,

722
00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:58.930
I love this for you.
There's nothing wrong.
There's nothing wrong.

723
00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:00.980
Ciao baby.
Huh?

724
00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:01.911
<v 7>That was scary.</v>

725
00:46:01.911 --> 00:46:04.670
I don't want people hurting themselves because he headed to that fan.
He's,

726
00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:05.930
he's experienced with that fan.

727
00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:08.660
He knows the fans that he knows that the capabilities he does.

728
00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:12.680
He's done that for fun.
Yeah.
Okay.
Morning Julia.

729
00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:14.390
It's so hard to watch.

730
00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:19.420
<v 9>It's not cool that you called the cops on me.
I keep running the keep finding me.</v>

731
00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:21.280
I had this field here that,
uh,

732
00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:25.120
Bill for you is going to be where our house was going to go.

bury you in it,
but uh,

739
00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:57.430
We found you Julia.
We can't do this here.
Julia.

740
00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:02.610
Julia,
I felt I got to gloss.
Greatest hits.

Kissing me,

744
00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:18.500
kissing after hers.
Amazing.
Yes.
I love you Julia [inaudible].

745
00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:19.950
Julia windmills.

746
00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:24.120
I just wanted to send you a little message and tell you that meeting with you.

747
00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:29.450
It was one of the,
one of the best,
a few minutes of my life.
Uh,

748
00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:30.110
you know,
something's

749
00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:32.850
<v 3>been sitting heavy on my mind.
Uh,
when you,</v>

750
00:47:32.851 --> 00:47:36.500
when you mentioned something about wanting to get back with your ex don't,

751
00:47:36.501 --> 00:47:41.110
which in the past,
believe me,
I know,
I know.
Don't look in the past cds,

752
00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:45.070
cds,

every,
every,

753
00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:48.220
every square inch of him and it never,
and never looked back.

754
00:47:48.221 --> 00:47:49.970
Let's go full throttle.
Ciao.

755
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:53.920
There's a crown mold into the sealants.

756
00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:57.600
This hand gesturing too that he does the Blm owns the ceilings.

757
00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:02.120
All is Shariah Juliet receiving Christmas.
Julia,

758
00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:05.470
submit the morning.
Julia,

759
00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:10.400
when I was at the Grammercy Julia,
me again,
Joe.

760
00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:12.580
Look,
I just wanted to let you know,

761
00:48:12.581 --> 00:48:17.120
I heard what you had to say on the Todd and Christine,
one of the best moments

762
00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:23.060
and I wanted to get you a gift and the light of the holiday season,

763
00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:26.570
the basket I build,
the wine I built,

764
00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:30.320
I built these Christmas tree trimmings,

765
00:48:30.321 --> 00:48:33.860
come from an undisclosed location somewhere in north central.

766
00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:38.180
I call it the cabin of terrors.
And I,
Josh Potter,

767
00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:45.080
I wish you the merriest of holiday seasons and I hope you enjoy Christmas full

768
00:48:45.081 --> 00:48:46.030
throttle.
Wow.

769
00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:51.410
<v 0>She managed to get creepy too.
I know.
I think oddly it,</v>

770
00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:56.300
I think women tap into something that guys,
because the guys would you believe,

771
00:48:56.420 --> 00:49:00.760
and then you really see like that the woman is flipping what she's said

772
00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:04.500
<v 3>experienced before.
This is because we've all had the guy,</v>

773
00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:07.700
the Joe and this Mary.
You know,
it's funny.
When I was,
uh,

774
00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:10.740
when I was meeting fans after my second show at Gramercy theater,

775
00:49:10.741 --> 00:49:14.790
I meet fans just cause I'm a personality champ.
Like people like my personality,

776
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:18.420
I don't know.
Some guy,
some guy goes,
we built this theater for you.

777
00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:29.480
<v 0>God Damn.
And I love this thing.
Open up your and your arms.
Yeah.</v>

778
00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:31.393
There's another one.

779
00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:36.240
<v 3>Good morning,
uh,</v>

780
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:40.550
just wanting to say hi.
I can't stop thinking about you when your beauty.

781
00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:44.180
So I just wanted to show you,
I built us a little gingerbread house.

782
00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:49.060
Everything you see here,
I built a little gingerbread.

783
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:51.550
<v 0>Yeah,
a little gingerbread Joe.</v>

784
00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:57.370
That's the other thing is this amazing emphatically making it clear that cause

785
00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:01.600
it,
and he also,
what he says in that video,
he says,
uh,
you,

786
00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:04.300
you know everything you see here.
I built and then he goes,

787
00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:05.950
that's the kind of manager getting,

788
00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:10.810
so he's letting me know like you're getting a fucking guy.

789
00:50:10.811 --> 00:50:15.100
That's more than handy.
Right.
I can,
I can really,

790
00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:18.670
I can build you a home.
You're getting a lot of free stuff here.
Here's the trade.

791
00:50:19.070 --> 00:50:23.830
Right,
right.
You know a better house,
right?
Yeah.
I got,

792
00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:27.980
I can do all this stuff for you.
You can make my babies.
Yeah.
I went

793
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.870
<v 7>off to pay a contractor.
That's the best part.
This is all free labor.
Exactly.</v>

794
00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:33.740
I am a contractor.
Yeah.

795
00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:37.910
Leaning on me cause we got to lean

796
00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:44.540
on me a little gingerbread Joe.
I love this.

797
00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:48.440
You leaning on me because we got to lean on each other for support.

798
00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:52.760
I also built a little room and you in the eye.
I love this.

799
00:50:52.761 --> 00:50:57.260
This one might be my favorite.
That was looking at you.
Yeah,
like we got it.

800
00:50:57.261 --> 00:50:59.240
That's the message we've got to support each other.

801
00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:02.730
Like things over count.

802
00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:07.370
This girl's my favorite gingerbread house and we can hide all of the dead bodies

803
00:51:07.371 --> 00:51:12.140
in maybe your ex boyfriend.
I really think that we should go full throttle.

804
00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:17.660
If you don't agree it might be stabbing myself in the heart with the candy cane.

805
00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:22.880
Kelsey Kelsey,
I love you and I love your facial hair.

806
00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:27.320
The Gut t is a horrendous goatee is the 90s too.

807
00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:32.300
Joe is also not fashionable.
Yeah,
that's pretty good.
Oh God.

808
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:34.070
Good Morning Julia.

809

<v 8>Just wanted to say hello the Grinch.

Nice and full makeup.

811
00:51:42.141 --> 00:51:44.670
Probably the best day of my wife.
Look at that.
And it's amazing.

812
00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:48.470
Now you see behind you I've made with my bare hands in that child.

813

He's clearly a performer.
Yeah,

818
00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:12.760

829
00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:52.960

832
00:53:03.370 --> 00:53:07.430
<v 7>Merry Christmas.
Giulia,
the kiss that gets me at the,</v>

833
00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:11.170
here's the thing,
gene,
that all the audience.

834
00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:14.860
Yes you,
I think you sent me.
No,

835
00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:18.070
she sent me a message and then she sent it to you,

836
00:53:18.071 --> 00:53:20.530
but she sent me a message when I was,

837
00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:23.470
we were going back and forth after last week and I was like,

838
00:53:23.471 --> 00:53:27.870
you know you were grade and she said she had fun doing the interview and you

839
00:53:27.871 --> 00:53:31.140
know some of her friends listen.
She goes,
oh,

840
00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:36.780
there is one more video.
I was jamming with her on Instagram and I go,

841
00:53:36.781 --> 00:53:38.500
thank you for doing the show.
You did.
Amazingly,

842
00:53:38.501 --> 00:53:41.550
usually the audience is gonna love it.
And she goes,
well just,
you know,

843
00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:44.640
I have some other videos I have to go check in my other phone,

844
00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:48.420
give me a few hours,
I'll be right back.
And this is not a bit,

845
00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:50.790
because I know people would who listened to this show regularly be like,

846
00:53:50.791 --> 00:53:55.140
they're setting us up for a joke.
No,
this is not.
No.
So on bated breath,

847
00:53:55.141 --> 00:53:58.920
I'm waiting at lax airport to board a flight and I keep refreshing my day and

848
00:53:58.921 --> 00:54:03.780
you hit me up.
But when you tell me that's what it was,
I messaged her

849
00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:09.300
video and she's like,
yes,
I'm looking for it.

850
00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:13.050
And she said,
um,
she goes,
my,

851
00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:17.370
like after she got more comfortable with the craziness of it,

852
00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:22.830
right?
That her and her friends,
yes.
Hit him up once.
So what it was.

853
00:54:22.831 --> 00:54:25.860
So she sent me two videos and she goes,

854
00:54:25.861 --> 00:54:30.861
so my friends and I were kind of trying to bait him into making another video

855
00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:35.940
for us,
for me,
for Julia.
And this is what he sent.

856
00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:37.643
Yeah.

857
00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:42.060
So they were trying to get him to be tacked to fool a little bit more.

858
00:54:42.061 --> 00:54:45.600
Cause I like eventually she and her friends were just having a great time with

859
00:54:45.601 --> 00:54:48.690
it cause it's,
you know,
mortifying.
Yes.
So

860
00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:51.990
to be able to bring to you,

861
00:54:51.991 --> 00:54:56.280
this has never been seen anywhere else except for Julius phone.

862
00:54:56.520 --> 00:55:00.630
So it might be Joe seen it but that's it.

863
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:03.690
So this is,
you know,
you've seen the first one.

864
00:55:03.691 --> 00:55:07.200
You've seen the one in the car the next day.
My flour.

865
00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:09.930
But this is actually,

866
00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:20.700
I'm so excited.
I'm so excited.
I can't,
I can't even handle it.

867
00:55:20.701 --> 00:55:22.360
The video that no one has seen.

868
00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:26.010
Never before seen Joe footage show footage back to Julie.
All right,
here it is.

869
00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:30.030
See I'm half asleep on the couch.

870
00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:36.140
It disappointed you got to be wrapped around your finger.
Cute.

871
00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:41.370
But that's all you get.
I'm exhausted.
Blah.

872
00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:46.290
Ah,
ah,
there it is.

873
00:55:46.291 --> 00:55:50.730
So gross on so many levels.
A little more understated though than the other one.

874
00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:52.530
He's tired and he's engaged now.

875
00:55:52.531 --> 00:55:54.240
He thinks like if there's a little something going on,

876
00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:56.190
we didn't have to be as put on,

877
00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:00.060
here's what I don't like about this one is more disturbing because he's trying

878
00:56:00.061 --> 00:56:05.020
to be sexy.
Yes.
And he's like,
I'm just laying down Pat Patton,

879
00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:09.120
the chest get me all tired right now.

880
00:56:09.121 --> 00:56:11.250
Jewels.
Yeah.

881
00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:16.920
Like he's about to whip his peanut out and he's about to frantically masturbate

882
00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:21.240
it again.
See,
I'm half asleep on the couch.

883
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:29.060
Disappointed you got me wrapped around your finger,
but that's all you get.

884
00:56:29.061 --> 00:56:30.400
And I'm exhausted.

885
00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:38.940
Always put the kisses big on those kisses.
My favorite is the playful laugh.

886
00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:41.213
It's like,
yeah,

887
00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:53.780
uh,
it's so cringe.

888
00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:55.850
Got me wrapped around your finger.

889
00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:57.780
<v 6>Okay.</v>

890
00:56:57.780 --> 00:57:02.430
<v 7>She's,
I imagine the dialogue being like,
which will give me wrangle it.
You,</v>

891
00:57:02.431 --> 00:57:06.730
I promise.
Julie's like,
send me another video.
Come on please.

892
00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:09.220
And he's like,
Oh,
I'm tapped to run your finger.

893
00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:17.430
You did that like Coy Mike.
Yeah.
Sexy time.

894
00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:20.140
That's,
that's what I'm saying.
Like,
he's like,
oh,

895
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:26.560
she's like,
send me another video.
Come on,
try it.
Try and bait him probably.

896
00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:30.810
And then he was like,
all right,
but I'm going to make it sexy.

897
00:57:31.050 --> 00:57:35.940
We also said this one is like,
yeah,
it's like,

898
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:40.620
Ooh,
I just got home.
Yeah,
I have a lot left in the tank.
I'm all sweaty,

899
00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:44.140
but I'm thinking of you to Wah Wah.

900
00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:50.010
And it's dark in there.
It's poorly lit.
So He's like,
I'm just laying in the doc.

901
00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:53.580
I feel like those are all things you like you do to children,

902
00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:55.650
not to people you were romantically interested in.

903
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:59.830
What do you mean the children go ma?
Yeah.
Not to it.

904
00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:04.200
Or Oh,
you're serious about like,
or want to be,
hey,

905
00:58:04.201 --> 00:58:06.430
I'd like to take you out sometime.
Wow,

906
00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:10.650
you got me wrapped around your finger.
He said it's like a kid.

907
00:58:10.651 --> 00:58:15.390
Like I'll do anything for you to say that to an adult is weird.
So,

908
00:58:17.610 --> 00:58:22.240
but just so you know,
Julia herself also,
um,

909
00:58:22.410 --> 00:58:24.480
has had fun with this,
with her friends.

910
00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:28.490
So that's what we learned is that Julia's friends,
like,
you know,

911
00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:32.280
you guys have been submitting these hilarious Julia videos.

912
00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:34.890
They've been doing it,
sending them to her.

913
00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:40.050
So she sent us a cut of that to Julia.
Good morning.

914
00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:42.473
Good morning.

915
00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:50.910
Good morning,
Julia

916
00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:56.513
Child.

917
00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:06.300
Julia right there.
That's why Joe,
uh,

918
00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:12.560
for those of you just listening,
we have Juliet giving her shit.

919
00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:13.433
She's giving her

920
00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:19.440
beautiful as good night to Joe.

921
00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:27.120
<v 0>Ciao baby.
Can Joe.
Yeah.</v>

922
00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:31.070
What a perfect end to this whole thing.
That is great.
She's so for those,

923
00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:35.450
we just listening.
Julia is blonde.
She's got long blonde hair,

924
00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:38.850
Brown eyes.
Beautiful.
She's a beautiful girl.
Yeah.
So that's a reason.

925
00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:41.660
There's a reason she followed her into a parking lot.

926
00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:46.580
If you were imagining a pig.
She is not.
No,
she's great.

927
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:49.970
She's sweet and lovely person.
Yeah.
That is so funny.

928
00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:54.080
And then a Glazer's Joe's next message.

929
00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:55.360
Oh Man.

930
00:59:58.850 --> 01:00:01.720
That's what he wants to say in this last video.
I know,

931
01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:06.410
but he dialed it back to like,
oh,
look at,
look at what you've done to me.

932
01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:10.880
Ah,
ah,
I miss you Julia.

933
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:14.870
Um,
look at what you've done to me.
What does this say right here?

934
01:00:14.871 --> 01:00:19.410
Someone said that their boyfriend mix up the flower delivery.
Uh,

935
01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.970
he must be cheating with me on his sidekick.
Julia,
what's this mean?

936
01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:27.910
I got a Christmas flower delivery and I always thinking,
wow,

937
01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:29.150
it's so beautiful.

938
01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:35.810
But who is Julia?
Julia?

939
01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:40.640
This is the kind of man you're getting full travel.
Who is Julia?

940
01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:42.790
That's so hilarious.
That's funny.

941
01:00:42.791 --> 01:00:47.150
Your Morning Julia Mon and um,
all right,
our guest is here.

942
01:00:47.151 --> 01:00:50.660
Why don't we step away for a moment and look what you've done to me.

943
01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:54.740
Come right back.
You got me wrapped around your finger tight.
We'll be right back.

944
01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.380
Okay.
We're back from our break.

945
01:01:00.381 --> 01:01:05.120
You never heard and we are joined now by our guests.
Um,
a,

946
01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:10.070
a friend of ours,
a comedian,
a podcast or an actor,

947
01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:14.120
a working actor.
I just went on some of those people go.
I'm an actor,

948
01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:18.540
a working voiceover accurate as well.
Mr. Adam Ray.
Thanks for

949
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:24.250
<v 4>here.
Very warm wolverine.
Former Wolverine.
Right?
What's not drop that stat.</v>

950
01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:28.900
I didn't mean to do that.
Oh,
it's okay man.
It's a lot of ex main characters.

951
01:01:28.901 --> 01:01:32.020
Don't get there,
Charlie.
Talking about University of Michigan,
my bad.
Oh Shit.

952
01:01:32.530 --> 01:01:36.280
I wish my mom wishes.
Yeah.
Yeah,
towards fan.
Well,
yeah.

953
01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:39.640
Not that I wasn't a theme park character.
That's true.
Yeah.
The beat is,
oh,

954
01:01:39.641 --> 01:01:42.700
I didn't know that.
Yeah.
Not the Hollywood boulevard though.

955
01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:43.980
Like actually inside the theme,

956
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.960
the theme park and not that I want to knock the guys that cruise the boulevard

957
01:01:47.290 --> 01:01:48.670
with like peanut butter shoes and stuff,

958
01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:52.210
but like I imagine those guys I think got it really bad because they're trying

959
01:01:52.211 --> 01:01:55.540
to like a universal,
people will know you're supposed to be there.
That's right.

960
01:01:55.541 --> 01:01:59.380
Boulevard.
People were like,
all right,
I was looking to go check out,

961
01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:04.440
you know,
Ripley's believe it or not and I accosting me for six bucks.
You know?

962
01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:07.720
How many people do you think are thrilled if there at Hollywood boulevard to

963
01:02:07.721 --> 01:02:09.550
seat to see those people?
They're like,
oh,

964
01:02:09.551 --> 01:02:13.710
that's awesome because that's Elmo sesame street now.
Yeah,
they're kind of,

965
01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:17.570
they're delusional.
I saw kids there too.
Delusional types of up.

966
01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:21.360
They just cancel other out and nobody knows what the fuck's I think so.

967
01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:22.890
I think they're probably really pumped it.

968
01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:25.080
I think a lot of the tourists that go there are just like,

969
01:02:25.081 --> 01:02:27.810
they want to soak up every piece of that street.

970
01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:33.060
Isn't it exciting hearing this voice in your ears?
Oh man,

971
01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:35.790
that's Tequila weed and just x men stories.

972
01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.350
I feel like I only have this voice after a rough night voice.

973
01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:44.640
Great Voice.
By the way,
Adam figure Adam's in the more like that,

974
01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:47.400
that level of base he has.
There's times where I wake up and I'm like,

975
01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:51.630
oh I should do voiceover.
Like it sounds that Alec Baldwin.

976
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.370
Yes.
So wait,

977
01:02:56.371 --> 01:03:00.930
so you were one of those costume people and so what's the worst part about,

978
01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:04.070
we prefer face character,
but it's okay.
You,

979
01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:09.110
I mean how fucking free tickets.
What's that?
It was hot.
It must've been so hard.

980
01:03:09.111 --> 01:03:12.630
This like Spandex,
you know,
muscly suit with the fake abs to fake chops.

981
01:03:12.631 --> 01:03:14.430
The fake fangs.
Actually one in there.

982
01:03:14.431 --> 01:03:18.420
One summer my boss who was like a former Disney princess turned head of the

983
01:03:18.421 --> 01:03:21.660
characters.
I won't say her name on this,
Jenna,
but she was like,

984
01:03:21.661 --> 01:03:25.530
kind of kind of the worst and like,
because she kind of took it out,

985
01:03:25.531 --> 01:03:30.390
like just had a sense of entitlement and she pulled me in one summer and,
uh,

986
01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:33.830
and you know,
I,
uh,
look,
I could be in better shape.

987
01:03:33.830 --> 01:03:37.410
And at this time I felt like I was in pretty good shape even for being a fake

988
01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.290
fucking theme park character.
And I'm like,
you're giving me fake abs,

989
01:03:40.291 --> 01:03:43.950
so you're already telling me I don't got to do a ton of work on my own,

990
01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:49.080
but I was fine.
And she pulls me in.
She goes,
hey.
So,
um,
I just,
uh,
you know,

991
01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:50.770
we're a,
we're a universal,
people come in,

992
01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:53.940
they want to meet Captain America at Spiderman and Wolverine.
And I go,
yeah,

993
01:03:53.941 --> 01:03:56.670
it's awesome.
Right?
Fucking people think that we're the real people.

994
01:03:56.671 --> 01:03:59.010
This is crazy.
And she goes,
yeah,
and you are.

995
01:03:59.070 --> 01:04:03.120
And so I just would be great if maybe you just took a couple of weeks off to

996
01:04:03.121 --> 01:04:06.650
just a firm up a little bit just to hone up,

997
01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:09.180
just get those arms really wolverine.
I'm like,

998
01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:12.720
I don't even think that's a real term.
He's like,
get a little,
uh,
you know,

999
01:04:12.721 --> 01:04:17.370
just jacked up.
You're seeing do Jackman like that.
So I'm like,
you know that,

1000
01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:21.570
um,
like the guy who is captain America has a bumper sticker on his Escalade that

1001
01:04:21.571 --> 01:04:26.100
says nobody's ugly after 2:00 AM right.
None of us are the real guys.
Right.

1002
01:04:26.310 --> 01:04:30.030
But they just,
uh,
you know,
there was this like,
you know,

1003
01:04:30.031 --> 01:04:32.740
attitude of like these kids think you're,
and they did like,

1004
01:04:33.110 --> 01:04:36.780
and I didn't know shit.
Uh,
like they would,
you know,
every other day like,

1005
01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:38.580
you know,
what's wolverines favorite food?

1006
01:04:38.581 --> 01:04:40.830
And I would always joke about this because I would just be like to make

1007
01:04:40.831 --> 01:04:44.100
characters laugh and they were always chastise me for being,
trying to be funny.

1008
01:04:44.110 --> 01:04:46.530
The wolverines not funny because they'd hear me being like,

1009
01:04:46.531 --> 01:04:49.770
you know what's wolverines favor to food?
And I was like potato salad.

1010
01:04:49.771 --> 01:04:52.440
And she was like that.
How long,
how long would you have this Gig?

1011
01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:55.920
Maybe four or five years.
That's a long,
that's a long,
this was,
yeah,

1012
01:04:55.921 --> 01:04:59.820
this was after 2000 cause I was a tour guide at universal studios first on the

1013
01:04:59.821 --> 01:05:03.780
trim.
I make up facts all the time.

1014
01:05:03.781 --> 01:05:05.790
And this was like when you first got here?
Yeah,

1015
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:08.040
I got it in 2001 went to acting school,

1016
01:05:08.041 --> 01:05:12.270
USC and then 2003 my sophomore year I was like,
I need a summer job.
Um,

1017
01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:14.970
and so tour guide was cool.
I don't want to,
you know,

1018
01:05:14.971 --> 01:05:17.620
I went with a buddy of mine wanted to do it.
He was like,

1019
01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:19.630
we've come with me just to the audition.
And then he didn't get,

1020
01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:22.750
he was like his dream to like tell people that that's jazz.

1021
01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.330
I was like his dream and then he got it.

1022
01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:27.100
But just so people know who've never been to universal studios.

1023
01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:30.610
So they take you on a tram and the train takes you through all the attractions

1024
01:05:30.611 --> 01:05:33.750
at universal but housewives and Dolly Parton House,

1025
01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:39.030
the psycho house opened with desperate housewives to universal studios and see

1026
01:05:39.551 --> 01:05:42.910
where it [inaudible] hey blowjobs gives a shit.
Right,

1027
01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:46.590
because you did you get like,
that's what I would say on the tour to

1028
01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:54.950
the wild whatnot.
Well,
there was the tank where Kramer swam and Seinfeld,
um,

1029
01:05:55.090 --> 01:05:58.250
what else do the,
uh,
was a

1030
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:01.270
three week training course.

1031
01:06:01.271 --> 01:06:04.210
They give you a binder and I was in a fraternity in college at the time,

1032
01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:08.560
sort of lock myself in my frat during parties and memorize,
you know,

1033
01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:12.340
hours of material because you had to no other facts for the certain stops.

1034
01:06:12.341 --> 01:06:14.020
And then if you've got stalled in the summertime,

1035
01:06:14.021 --> 01:06:17.200
like backed up champions to get like six deep and you'd be waiting to go into

1036
01:06:17.201 --> 01:06:20.260
the earthquake,
you've got five deep.
So you'd have video clips.
Oh,

1037
01:06:20.290 --> 01:06:22.000
before they bought him video clips to play,

1038
01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.590
you had to just have stalled material.

1039
01:06:23.710 --> 01:06:28.300
So that's when I would start doing standup and doing like when flex some of this

1040
01:06:28.301 --> 01:06:32.320
open mic material on this and uh,
and you know,
some of it will go over.

1041
01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:35.200
Well I love,
by the way,
the journeys of people,

1042
01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:39.340
like all of us habit that they tried to do show Biz.
You have,

1043
01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:44.050
don't you like looking back and be like ours universal tour guy.
It was funny.

1044
01:06:44.051 --> 01:06:44.884
Wolverine,

1045
01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:48.670
like all these different was a cop two I hosted the fear factor live show there.

1046
01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:50.140
It got projectile vomited on,

1047
01:06:50.141 --> 01:06:54.910
said what the fuck in front of 1200 kids boss chewed me out.

1048
01:06:54.911 --> 01:06:57.970
He's like,
what are you doing?
1200 kids vomited on.
Yeah,
go.

1049
01:06:57.990 --> 01:07:00.670
What'd you want me to say?
Is that all you got?
Bring it on.
He's like,

1050
01:07:00.690 --> 01:07:03.190
you fucking said what the fuck 1200 kids.

1051
01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:06.310
And it was still going to do cause like it's such bullshit stents.
You're like,

1052
01:07:06.311 --> 01:07:09.370
all right,
when these guys were going to put them up on these,
uh,
B,

1053
01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:11.380
these flat beams and a,

1054
01:07:11.381 --> 01:07:16.381
and when I say go and then side effect goes go goosh the bottom drops out and

1055
01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:19.660
they put,
they're attached to this wire.
So I'm like,
but there are dads do a wire.

1056
01:07:19.661 --> 01:07:22.660
And I started improvising what time I go.
So there's no real danger of,

1057
01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:25.270
so what are we actually doing here?
And My boss is like,

1058
01:07:25.330 --> 01:07:29.080
you can't keep vamping on the script.
And so they would drop and they're hanging.

1059
01:07:29.081 --> 01:07:31.600
And then it's just like,
who can hang the longest without freaking out?

1060
01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:34.840
But then they have to eat actually a fear factor concoction like they would on

1061
01:07:34.841 --> 01:07:37.060
the show and it'd be like,
you know,

1062
01:07:37.061 --> 01:07:40.980
I don't know beaver twats and like pickle juice and um,
uh,
you know,

1063
01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:43.330
old milk and this one guy,
damn,

1064
01:07:43.331 --> 01:07:46.480
it's just projectile vomited on me and I'm literally,
I'm facing the crowd ago.

1065
01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:50.350
Come on everybody,
let's pump up the fear of whatever the bullshit,
you know,

1066
01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:51.950
give it up for Steve.
And they just,

1067
01:07:52.030 --> 01:07:54.640
I remember turning back to him and he just looked at me and just,
that was it.

1068
01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:58.870
And I was like,
what the fuck man?
And I heard half gasp and half like laughter.

1069
01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:03.670
Uh,
so that lasted a couple months.
How much do you make?

1070
01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:08.940
50 to 50 a show for the fear factor shows certain that's actually really good.

1071
01:08:09.970 --> 01:08:14.140
Certain guys would do five or six shows a day and kill it.
Lou's brother,

1072
01:08:14.141 --> 01:08:17.060
the blues brothers guys were making like 55 his show,
it's great.

1073
01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:21.470
Marine was like 22 an hour.
Your Mc like as an MC at the club.

1074
01:08:21.610 --> 01:08:23.930
We were really learning tour guy was shit though.
And that's why I was like,

1075
01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:27.950
I gotta I gotta get promoted.
How much boring,
how much for the tram?

1076
01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:28.970
The Tram House.

1077
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.660
I'm curious about the tram cause that's actually is quite a skill.
It is.

1078
01:08:32.210 --> 01:08:33.290
That should have been the most,

1079
01:08:33.291 --> 01:08:37.160
but like you have to accumulate a certain amount of hours to get a pay bump.

1080
01:08:37.310 --> 01:08:40.880
So I think when I started it was like eight 50 an hour,
which by the way,

1081
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:45.760
for our shows a day now that's not enough.
And three week training and then uh,

1082
01:08:45.790 --> 01:08:48.980
and then uh,
I mean it was bonkers.
God Damn abuse is what it is.

1083
01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:50.540
And also I was like,
make it a pretty fun,

1084
01:08:50.541 --> 01:08:52.370
there's a lot of tour guides and just do the bare minimum.

1085
01:08:52.371 --> 01:08:56.390
And they do the written jokes like,
you know,
uh,
you know,
for the jaws like,

1086
01:08:56.391 --> 01:09:01.080
oh Steve,
yeah guys,
we have to,
our friend Steve,
wait,
Steve,
get out.
Oh well the,

1087
01:09:01.081 --> 01:09:03.290
I guess this will be as less swim or you know,

1088
01:09:03.291 --> 01:09:07.010
but I would like actually stand up.
Take my sunglasses off,
freak the fuck out.

1089
01:09:07.011 --> 01:09:07.761
I met a girl cry,

1090
01:09:07.761 --> 01:09:11.990
I'm like my third tour because like fucking dumb acting student fresh out of

1091
01:09:11.991 --> 01:09:14.890
college.
I'm like,
this is an acting exercise.
Sure,
sure.

1092
01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:19.550
And I committed and I was like,
there's a fucking shotgun.
And she started balling

1093
01:09:21.830 --> 01:09:25.700
universal and should go to the Kiddos.
They got to Harry Potter world.

1094
01:09:25.701 --> 01:09:28.060
They're now when did you go to sc?
Yeah.

1095
01:09:29.190 --> 01:09:33.500
That's hard to get into that school for acting.
I mean,
yes,
I auditioned for,

1096
01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:36.890
cause you know,
my sat scores were shit.
I had a pretty good GPA,

1097
01:09:36.891 --> 01:09:38.570
some extracurricular stuff.
But then,

1098
01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:40.400
and then when I went to the admissions people,

1099
01:09:40.401 --> 01:09:43.880
they were like really pray and that juice stuff,
they didn't say it like that,

1100
01:09:43.881 --> 01:09:48.260
I'm paraphrasing,
but they were like,
you know,
diversity and all that.
And uh,

1101
01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:50.150
and then I wanted,
you know,

1102
01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:53.960
it wasn't totally sure if I want to do full on because in the BFA,
which I was in

1103
01:09:56.170 --> 01:09:59.000
a lot of shoes on the shelf,
you know,
rabbi,

1104
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:05.220
how'd you get my rabbi?
Soundbite from the end of my bar Mitzvah.
I was like,

1105
01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:08.540
that's life.
Yeah,
you're a man.
It was congrats.

1106
01:10:08.541 --> 01:10:12.340
Give it up to mother fucking mother fucker.
Yeah,

1107
01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:16.130
my aunt goes,
I knew that was his name.
And so,
uh,

1108
01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.980
and so I auditioned because they were like,

1109
01:10:18.981 --> 01:10:22.130
you have a better chance if you get into the acting school then they'll tell the

1110
01:10:22.131 --> 01:10:26.000
school you have to take them cause we're taking them.
So the BFA is like,

1111
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:30.020
you know,
class from nine to six better teachers more.
Um,

1112
01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:31.550
it's just a more rigorous program,
you know,

1113
01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:35.000
and so auditioning for that and then I got in and got it.

1114
01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:39.200
And because I don't think I would have otherwise the mean average sats do the

1115
01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:42.500
sat average I think of my incoming freshman class was like 15,
20.

1116
01:10:42.930 --> 01:10:46.220
Mine was like 11,
10 spare tonight.
Is it,

1117
01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:51.320
I mean a lot of time I was like cat is to,
kitten is fig,
Newton is the futon.

1118
01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:55.510
And I'd be like probably futon
dumb,

1119
01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:59.600
dumb fucking t those I second guess myself all the time.
I would get in my head,

1120
01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:03.410
put all the pressure on.
I just think the Jews a great

1121
01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:08.830
good killing it with those men.
I don't think you should stop doing it.

1122
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:11.990
Your fingers always in the right place.
Do you know,

1123
01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:15.800
do you know about this Joe Juliet stuff?
Do you know about this?
No.

1124
01:11:15.810 --> 01:11:18.900
I know about your Garth,
that stuff,
which okay is maybe like,

1125
01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:22.830
and this is why you guys are so prolific and incredible on his Instagram.

1126
01:11:22.831 --> 01:11:27.540
Go ahead and the clips you post of them are just so spot on and,

1127
01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:31.410
and I love like worst and some people it just like as soon as you posted I was

1128
01:11:31.411 --> 01:11:34.740

I get exactly what you're talking about.
The guys just,

1129
01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:39.450
and eventually what's so great about it,
I don't see it stopping anytime soon.

1130
01:11:39.810 --> 01:11:42.300
You're going to get them in here.
Well I hope so.

1131
01:11:42.301 --> 01:11:45.840
I swear to God you're going to get here.
I guarantee he's a fan of comedy.

1132
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:46.741
Who knows what he likes.

1133
01:11:46.741 --> 01:11:49.980
He could be a big carrot top guy or like maybe it's like that Bonnie hunt show

1134
01:11:49.981 --> 01:11:54.650
needs to come back.
You know,
he doesn't like being made fun of.

1135
01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:59.820
I'm sure.
Well yeah.
So the comments,

1136
01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:04.980
his comments like that,
I don't mean like one or two.

1137
01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:09.600
Like I'm saying of these like 3000 right here.
Are they trolling them card?

1138
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:14.700
Oh boy.
Well that's what you get for being the biggest selling act of all time.

1139
01:12:15.090 --> 01:12:18.120
Right.
I know.
It's like if you're going to be that big dude,

1140
01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:21.450
you gotta roll with it.
The youtube comments are probably a plenty,
you know,

1141
01:12:21.451 --> 01:12:24.240
like just roll with it.
Roll with it,
man.

1142
01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:27.440
Isn't that one of his songs role with controlling or what?
You know,

1143
01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:32.310
here are the comments on his latest posts.
Top comment does miss you with,

1144
01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:37.980
oh my God,
look at these comments.
Hashtag try it out.
Yes.

1145
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:41.910
You got everything that you see in this house.
I built Giulia.

1146
01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:46.830
That's the kind of man you're good throttled jeans up and this is all Wyoming

1147
01:12:48.170 --> 01:12:51.750
correction last so much longer.
Especially during anal that,

1148
01:12:51.751 --> 01:12:54.620
well that's just like you learn that in the fifth grade.
So that's just like

1149
01:12:56.210 --> 01:12:58.440
I was explaining to people.
They're like,
it's from a podcast

1150
01:12:59.970 --> 01:13:03.690
with the income at conversations or maybe some of the best things the Internet

1151
01:13:03.691 --> 01:13:06.690
provides.
You know where people then who don't know each other like did,

1152
01:13:06.691 --> 01:13:10.500
I'll tell you what's going on.
I know.
You know what I'm saying?
This person said,

1153
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:14.100
I'm so torn and pretty sad.

1154
01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:16.313
We'd,
so Garth,

1155
01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:18.660
do you think one day you're just going to be reading these comments and all of

1156
01:13:18.661 --> 01:13:20.130
sudden you're just going to see below like,

1157
01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:25.260
and rock 29 just going to see Garth knows 62 like,
you know,

1158
01:13:25.261 --> 01:13:30.000
I don't find this shit that funny.
I was going to integrate his,

1159
01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:32.830
his say I submitted a false,

1160
01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:35.730
somebody on the marketing team has definitely been like,
look,

1161
01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:39.870
you guys are too big to for him to not know that this is happening,
uh,
at,

1162
01:13:39.871 --> 01:13:43.410
and at least they're probably like a couple of assholes.
Just let it go.

1163
01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:47.530
You know that to other breaking it down the shore for sure.
And I,

1164
01:13:47.531 --> 01:13:50.940
and I'd like to say this,
we have no ill will towards Garth.

1165
01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:55.500
We're just having fun and it's all in fun.
It's a universe what it is too.

1166
01:13:55.501 --> 01:13:59.440
It's a great example in like,
dude,
don't take yourself so seriously.
Yeah.

1167
01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:03.030
Especially when you're a country rock music superstar.

1168
01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:05.280
When I saw Celine Dion in Vegas,

1169
01:14:05.370 --> 01:14:07.260
and I've always said that sentence a couple of times out loud,

1170
01:14:08.850 --> 01:14:13.780
you should limit it.
My buddy had tickets when I was out there,
uh,
for that,
um,

1171
01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:15.400
this Vegas comedy festival,

1172
01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:20.200
which was crazy because the night before I'd gambled with a sickler and Josh,

1173
01:14:20.201 --> 01:14:23.020
Adam Meyers and Bert Kreischer and we'd all,
we're playing roulette.

1174
01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:26.380
Bert didn't remember it,
which is insane because he instigated,

1175
01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:31.540
he instigated us winning all at ton of cash.
We put down,
I think a hundred.

1176
01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.820
It was like,
let's put it on a hundred before we whatever on black.

1177
01:14:33.821 --> 01:14:35.710
And then we won.
And they were like,
oh yeah.

1178
01:14:35.890 --> 01:14:39.990
And then bridges look through when it goes,
let it ride led,
right.

1179
01:14:40.010 --> 01:14:42.070
And we were like,
yeah,
we did it again.
One again,

1180
01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:45.280
did that five times and why and then sickle when I was like,

1181
01:14:45.610 --> 01:14:49.420
I mean maybe we just fucking stuff away this point.
Like that's extra cash.

1182
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:53.330
And then he said,
let it ride one more time.
And it's the most racist comedian.

1183
01:14:53.950 --> 01:14:58.870
True.
You let it ride again in one and then left.
And then,
uh,

1184
01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:01.990
and then the next day we were like,
dude,
I'm going to say it's on my breakfast.

1185
01:15:01.991 --> 01:15:04.870
And I was like,
hey man,
thanks for that extra laundry money.
And he was like,

1186
01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:09.010
we talking about,
I was like,
Ugh,
let it ride your catchphrase of the night.

1187
01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:13.120
And he was like,
man,
I just rugged,
I don't even black.
And now it's good.

1188
01:15:13.121 --> 01:15:17.350
It's usually a sign that,
but it was so fun.
But so the next time my buddy's like,

1189
01:15:17.351 --> 01:15:21.220
I'm supposed to go to Celine Dion with my,
um,
with my wife and she's sick.

1190
01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.770
She's like,
do you want to go?
I was like,
I dunno man.
He goes,
I got a blunt.

1191
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:27.580
I was like,
that sounds fun.
So we go,
we were like fifth row,
first of all,

1192
01:15:27.581 --> 01:15:28.540
she's unbelievable,

1193
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:31.860
but it's one of those Vegas acts and one of these artists that has done probably

1194
01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:35.800
hundreds of thousands of shows that she,
um,
she's like,
hey man,

1195
01:15:35.801 --> 01:15:39.850
this is also an opportunity for me to spread my wings comedically.
And,
uh,

1196
01:15:40.450 --> 01:15:44.650
you Caesar's as a giant open mic and pump out a little standard material,

1197
01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:47.710
Celine style.
She was like,
every opportunity was a song.

1198
01:15:47.711 --> 01:15:50.230
She was like in between two and she'd be like,
this is my backups.

1199
01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:53.440
My backup guitar player won.
He's been with me for 20 years.

1200
01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:56.790
He's been with me for 20 years.
He's been with me,
but one of the years.

1201
01:15:56.791 --> 01:15:58.960
And I was like,
well,
just on the set list,
what the fuck's going on?

1202
01:15:59.470 --> 01:16:02.320
And then she came out in a yellow dress at one point and she goes,
look at me.

1203
01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:06.640
I'm so Yaddo.
I'm so Yaddo.
Um,
so yeah,
it'll yellow and I'm just like in the back,

1204
01:16:06.641 --> 01:16:11.020
like no one's disputing the color.
What the fuck?
And then she just goes,
I'm like,

1205
01:16:11.050 --> 01:16:14.200
and it stops and does like a turn to the camera and goes,

1206
01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:18.970
I'm like Celine Dijon.
And everybody lost their fucking minds,

1207
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.300
including me,
because I had reached like the peak high and I was like,

1208
01:16:22.330 --> 01:16:26.830
I'm not above a good condiment joke.
Yeah,
that's good.
And uh,
but every,

1209
01:16:26.831 --> 01:16:29.380
and then she talked for 20 minutes and then you go there.
In my inner being,

1210
01:16:29.381 --> 01:16:31.990
like pick it up,
pick it up,
you're doing too much.
Stand up.

1211
01:16:32.050 --> 01:16:35.620
She would call it stand up and then she'd go into my heart will go on.

1212
01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:39.490
Or that's the way it is.
And you just forget about everything.
She just done,

1213
01:16:39.491 --> 01:16:43.090
you know,
it's amazing.
Show.
Unbelievable whole gone.
She's elevating.

1214
01:16:43.091 --> 01:16:46.420
There's fake rain.
Thought it was fake.
Look pretty real to me.
Maybe the,

1215
01:16:46.421 --> 01:16:49.180
we was great,
but she's just,
how does she fucking fly?

1216
01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:53.860
How does she sing without the accent?
Oh yeah.
That is a great,
I should have.

1217
01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:57.090
I should have raised my hand and asked that,
but I think

1218
01:16:59.330 --> 01:17:01.580
it went away when you sing.
I've heard that.

1219
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:03.070
I think they have to train themselves.

1220
01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:05.850
The train the accent out cause you can't hear it.
Yeah.

1221
01:17:06.570 --> 01:17:10.160
The singing people train accents.
You can train

1222
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:14.840
<v 7>it out.
Yeah.
You hear other British pop singers will have sound.
No accent.</v>

1223
01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:19.130
Yeah.
In their song.
God's action stays pretty consistent though,
doesn't it?

1224
01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:24.170
Does he do a little bit of a,
you know,
in between,

1225
01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:27.680
I know it's been to a show now.
Somebody offered me this though.
They said,

1226
01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:30.830
they said if you were given tickets,

1227
01:17:31.850 --> 01:17:34.670
you go and if you enjoyed it,
would you admit it?
And I was like,

1228
01:17:34.730 --> 01:17:37.680
I have to say yes to both.
Yeah.
I wish I would go.

1229
01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:40.880
I would say that I had a good time if I did.
Yeah,
for sure.

1230
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.860
I wouldn't go into like a sour post that would be like,
yeah,

1231
01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:48.740
it's not that we're not ripping on his music or his talent.

1232
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:52.580
Curious about people that tour to that size of an audit,

1233
01:17:52.581 --> 01:17:56.330
like even the wiggles on mine now.
What are they doing that I'm not doing you,

1234
01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:57.470
by the way,
the sleep thing,

1235
01:17:57.471 --> 01:18:02.000
because it makes me realize if you're super famous and a singer,

1236
01:18:02.001 --> 01:18:05.030
they all do this because it's your fans.

1237
01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:08.660
You get to see what their real sense of humor is like.

1238
01:18:08.661 --> 01:18:12.860
And you get to see who was legit funny because the audience will laugh at

1239
01:18:12.861 --> 01:18:17.530
whatever.
Well that's right.
More saline,
saline Deshaan great.

1240
01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:23.230
But I mean it just was angry.
All that between the song like

1241
01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:27.770
that they all do.
I've been to shows where you were like,

1242
01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:31.040
I wish she would just sing the next fucking,
and then there's legit.

1243
01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:35.300
I'm sure you know people who are pretty funny.
I Bet Dolly Parton's pretty funny.

1244
01:18:35.370 --> 01:18:39.110
I bet that's true.
Yes.
I Bet Mumford and sons not,

1245
01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.820
but I bet to all this.
But that was,
what's the best though.

1246
01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:46.070
She can't do any better than Dolly Parton now.
Do you think she's a lesbian?

1247
01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:47.630
Oh No.

1248
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:52.320
There's stories floating that she's been married to the same guy that ever was

1249
01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:55.880
not a jeopardy question.
This lesbian wants to lesbian.

1250
01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:57.860
He never heard this though,
that she has,
uh,

1251
01:18:57.890 --> 01:19:00.710
like Jolene was written about some woman that she loved or something.

1252
01:19:00.711 --> 01:19:03.470
I don't know enough Dolly's stuff.
The only note around,

1253
01:19:03.471 --> 01:19:07.850
very close or very informed of don of Dali.
So I could be,
I could ask,

1254
01:19:08.330 --> 01:19:11.420
I don't want to say,
I'd like to know the truth.
Let's find this out.
Okay,

1255
01:19:11.421 --> 01:19:15.200
we'll find out.
She also seems like one of those journey,
you know,
artists,

1256
01:19:15.201 --> 01:19:19.040
it's just like done it all seen it all could have stories where it's like

1257
01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:22.820
there's one time I was on a flat to Burbank,
we ended up in Mongolia.

1258
01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:27.470
Next thing you know I'm scissoring a couple,
you know,
ESL students,
you know,

1259
01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:29.780
and you're just like,
all right,
let's rock and roll lifestyle.
And you know,

1260
01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:33.800
I saw her in Atlanta once in an airport and the airport in Atlanta.
Cool.

1261
01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:37.580
Did you go to her?
She famous people do.
Yeah.
No I leave him.

1262
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:41.240
I would only ever,
ever do it to one person,

1263
01:19:41.241 --> 01:19:43.740
which is how we're starting because I love Howard Stern.
I fucking,

1264
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:48.320
that's who I would do it too.
Even though I've done it too.
The goo goo dolls.
But

1265
01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:54.320
he did say to take a picture with him cause I

1266
01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:01.640
rest in peace.
Semper fi.
Brad Pitt.
I don't give a fuck about,

1267
01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:03.350
no,
I don't care about,
that's all.

1268
01:20:03.351 --> 01:20:08.250
I did that interview with Larry King and he was like,
yeah,
who are you?
Like

1269
01:20:08.610 --> 01:20:12.240
<v 5>if you ever been starstruck.
And I was like yeah,
by rappers.
And he was like,
what?</v>

1270
01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:16.070
And I was like,
he gets angry.
I go out and run in.
What's around?
I mean,
I think,

1271
01:20:16.071 --> 01:20:20.940
I think,
uh,
I think some athletes are cool.
Like where I've been like,

1272
01:20:20.970 --> 01:20:24.150
oh,
you know,
I love sports.
So I've been like,
but I don't think it would be like,

1273
01:20:24.670 --> 01:20:29.160
like maybe Jordan would make me do that because,
uh,
no,
no.
I mean I would be like,

1274
01:20:29.161 --> 01:20:33.840
that's cool.
Yeah.
I'm Greg Louganis for sure.
Dude,
you swam with it.

1275
01:20:35.670 --> 01:20:40.020
But I feel like if it were,
I know that I've,

1276
01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:43.530
I've been actually at a loss for words with different rappers that I've just run

1277
01:20:43.531 --> 01:20:46.490
into him because that's just,
I feel like it's,

1278
01:20:46.491 --> 01:20:50.640
it's more rooted in childhood,
you know?
Was that in style Jea?
And you're like,

1279
01:20:50.641 --> 01:20:55.440
this person defined an era for me.
I get kind of freaked out by it.

1280
01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:56.900
Well,
you're Tyson stories,

1281
01:20:56.910 --> 01:21:01.290
like one of the greatest stories I would break down for Ben.
Thank you.

1282
01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:04.540
Thank happened.
And I,
you know,
crazy broken down daisy.

1283
01:21:04.590 --> 01:21:07.920
Also the amount of layers to that story is just like,
I remember,

1284
01:21:07.921 --> 01:21:12.030
I think the first time I heard you say that the icehouse before you taped it and

1285
01:21:12.031 --> 01:21:16.170
I was just like,
I can't even believe like when it should have maybe stopped.

1286
01:21:16.171 --> 01:21:20.130
I was like,
there's more to this.
It was right.
Yes.
Did you have to,

1287
01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:24.680
and you know what the layer,
the layer of it that I ended up telling the uh,

1288
01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:26.070
a condensed version.
No,

1289
01:21:26.071 --> 01:21:30.660
I ended up telling the followup story because I realized that the story ends

1290
01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:34.140
with a phone hanging up.
Like that's how the bit,
and that's how the special ends.

1291
01:21:34.141 --> 01:21:36.750
Yes.
And people would always be like,
did he ever,
did you ever,

1292
01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:40.000
did he ever show up?
Yes.
And he did.
And so I would tell that story.
Right.

1293
01:21:40.170 --> 01:21:43.140
It took you a little bit to go,
oh,
I need to add that to it.
Yeah.
Well,

1294
01:21:43.141 --> 01:21:45.720
what happened was since it was at the end of a special,

1295
01:21:46.170 --> 01:21:49.260
what I realized was like everyone was asking me about that story and I was like,

1296
01:21:49.261 --> 01:21:51.600
well,
I know I can tell you the rest of the story.

1297
01:21:51.690 --> 01:21:53.140
So I put that as a bonus on that.

1298
01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:57.480
But then the thing that happened that really doesn't get the attention because

1299
01:21:57.481 --> 01:21:58.830
of the way it is,

1300
01:21:58.831 --> 01:22:03.360
but I put it on Instagram because that's the only place I knew to share it.

1301
01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:08.550
I get a year later,
a photograph that this guy,

1302
01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:10.410
multiple photographs and he's like,

1303
01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:15.470
so I was at the airport in Pittsburgh and the story,

1304
01:22:16.831 --> 01:22:20.400
but I tell was about being on a flight from la to Pittsburgh and he's like,

1305
01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:24.810
check this out and it's these photographs and Tyson is posing with people and

1306
01:22:24.811 --> 01:22:28.620
it's,
it's coming off that flight and he's holding my DVD.

1307
01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:34.290
So it really tied in.
Oh,
Angela demised it on Instagram.

1308
01:22:34.291 --> 01:22:37.790
People were like,
Oh,
this Photoshop.
I'm like,
no,
I just gave it to him.

1309
01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:42.390
Like it's like the thing I just gave them.
So you see him like holding it,

1310
01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:46.530
which I always thought was,
you know,
a trip,
right?
Yeah.
It's like actually,
yeah.

1311
01:22:46.531 --> 01:22:51.360
And it,
and it totally validates the story.
But yeah,
I mean,
meeting,

1312
01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:56.220
you know him was insane.
Jordan.
I feel like it would be way less personable,

1313
01:22:56.250 --> 01:22:59.460
but I would still be like,
oh,
I wouldn't know what to say to him.
Yeah.

1314
01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:03.780
I'm trying to think of like anybody else,
uh,
Kim deal of the pixies.

1315
01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:06.070
That'd be great.
But you forced

1316
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:09.070
<v 7>me to go up to her.
I never would have let her go up to her.</v>

1317
01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:12.250
I knew what that meant.
I knew what it meant or,
yeah.
So I was like,

1318
01:23:12.450 --> 01:23:13.420
should I say AV?

1319
01:23:13.710 --> 01:23:16.390
Cause if it would have been like that's somebody from that band and I know she

1320
01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:18.850
doesn't care.
Yup.
But when I,
when she was like,

1321
01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:22.690
oh my God can do all I see are like rocking,
like it's like a crazy,
I was like,

1322
01:23:22.691 --> 01:23:25.540
yes,
you should.
I go,
you're never going to be so nice to me.

1323
01:23:25.541 --> 01:23:30.170
She was the next her teeth,
she picked her.
She was like,
I had a um,

1324
01:23:30.270 --> 01:23:34.890
sitting outside diner.
She was like,
yeah.
She was like,
well I'll take a picture.

1325
01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:39.700
And I was like,
yeah,
hold on.
Just let me know.
She was tuned to show.

1326
01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:43.540
Yeah.
Okay.
Who else?
So,
first of all,
most importantly,

1327
01:23:43.690 --> 01:23:47.650
who's got a bigger dog shack or Jordan?
Go ahead.
Well,

1328
01:23:47.651 --> 01:23:51.540
I was told by someone who met Jordan wants that his hands are like,

1329
01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:54.430
is it that seemed like I was going to be like the date there's got Jordan's got

1330
01:23:54.431 --> 01:23:58.420
the car that his hand is like gigantic,
gigantic.

1331
01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:03.280
I feel like I'm,
it's usually right.
People go,
what size shoe you.
Oh yeah.

1332
01:24:03.310 --> 01:24:05.740
He must be fucking with that penis,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,

1333
01:24:05.950 --> 01:24:08.200
which isn't always true though.
I mean,
as a Dick Detective,

1334
01:24:08.201 --> 01:24:12.490
I can say that is not that card sent true.
I mean,

1335
01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:15.130
I'll tell you this.
No,
you're right.
We got the opening theme

1336
01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:18.703
every Tuesday.

1337
01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:32.370
Oh my God.
We study them.
We know these things.
Yeah.
No,

1338
01:24:32.371 --> 01:24:34.860
but you know what I'm saying.
We got it all started because she was like,

1339
01:24:34.861 --> 01:24:38.130
one time she was like,
well,
that guy's really tall,
so he's got a huge Dick.
I go,

1340
01:24:38.370 --> 01:24:41.250
I don't think that's always the case.
Yeah.
Left in little dude.

1341
01:24:41.251 --> 01:24:44.040
I haven't seen short guys a big decks.
I have not seen that.

1342
01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:45.950
I got to have new pictures in the house.
Yeah,

1343
01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:49.860
there's definitely short guys with my,
um,
my cohost Bradley Williams,

1344
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.870
a test that he,
you know,
is,
uh,
he's,
he's a little guy packing.
Okay.
But also,

1345
01:24:54.871 --> 01:24:57.710
you know,
the small,
the small hands and everything like pretty sure,

1346
01:24:57.711 --> 01:25:01.470
sure it's bigger.
But,
um,
but I think with the big hand thing,
I don't know,

1347
01:25:01.471 --> 01:25:03.630
I think there was some truth to that,
but also shack,

1348
01:25:03.631 --> 01:25:07.170
like I just can't imagine that that thing doesn't also,

1349
01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:09.610
I was just like an extra leg.
It's,
yeah.

1350
01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:14.860
He could have on large Dick that is not proportionate to how big he is.

1351
01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:15.631
Oh yeah.

1352
01:25:15.631 --> 01:25:19.650
You would think that's a small Dick because he's such a proportion of girls see

1353
01:25:19.651 --> 01:25:22.440
it and they go,
wow,
I'm saying an eight inch Dick on him.

1354
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:26.100
Eight inches is definitely well above that.
Fine.
Yeah.
And then get into a lot of,

1355
01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:28.770
and you'd be like,
what's that thing you got?
You need tweezers.

1356
01:25:28.771 --> 01:25:32.730
What's going on there?
But it's actually a d,
You know,
but I'm asking you guys,

1357
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:34.950
what do you think's got a bigger one?
That's right.

1358
01:25:34.951 --> 01:25:38.070
You asked Shakeel [inaudible] George is a graceful,
I mean,

1359
01:25:38.130 --> 01:25:39.450
Jordan globalized the sport,

1360
01:25:39.451 --> 01:25:43.740
so I feel like his dick probably even just grew from just like the world

1361
01:25:43.741 --> 01:25:47.100
recognizing thank you for what you're doing for the sport.
The natural,

1362
01:25:47.101 --> 01:25:50.060
the universe,
universe,
big Dick Energy in federal.

1363
01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:54.540
That's Neil degrasse Tyson type shit or like,
yeah,
but he,
maybe it's the secret.

1364
01:25:54.810 --> 01:25:59.790
Right.
But just being like,
if I take Gatorade,
the China,
maybe my Kako right.

1365
01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:03.980
Follow suit.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Right.
But I think just being the greatest,

1366
01:26:03.981 --> 01:26:07.700
I feel like he's got to be,
I think so.
That's right.
I'm talking about stature.

1367
01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:10.380
I'm going to go.
But you said Chuck Keeler you said you know somebody that's,

1368
01:26:10.381 --> 01:26:12.380
I shy Kiehl's,

Oh Jesus.
Well,

1369
01:26:12.381 --> 01:26:16.830

Yeah.

1370
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:21.050
But also video hose and stuff.
Oh really?
Yes.
Whole videos was very,

1371
01:26:21.070 --> 01:26:23.450
videos are like,
his dig ain't all that you think like,

1372
01:26:23.530 --> 01:26:25.720
do they know it was just like lead them leaving his house or is that,

1373
01:26:25.721 --> 01:26:29.030
I'm just posting on Instagram.
They've even written about it.
Wow.

1374
01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:31.970
Sort of book like tells.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
But I mean,
you know,

1375
01:26:31.971 --> 01:26:35.740
these are bold move by the way to write a book after like fucking track Hoe

1376
01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:38.450
you're big like how many chapters is that?

1377
01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:42.390
I wanted my uterus to fall out and nothing happened.
Yeah.

1378
01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:47.300
It could have now hands,
you know,
the,
the,
the story in the NBA now is,

1379
01:26:47.301 --> 01:26:50.170
uh,
uh,
what's his name?
Kwame Leonard.
Um,

1380
01:26:50.210 --> 01:26:54.590
am I saying his hands?
Have you seen the stories about that?

1381
01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:57.230
So there he was like getting some photo like after you know,

1382
01:26:57.231 --> 01:26:59.960
the after workout sometimes they'll all,
and people were like,

1383
01:26:59.961 --> 01:27:02.540
what the fuck is going on with his hands?

1384
01:27:02.710 --> 01:27:07.400
It turns out he has the largest hands in the NBA right now.
Dan.
He's a big guy,

1385
01:27:07.730 --> 01:27:12.730
but there's guys that are bigger and it's unnatural men and it actually for sure

1386
01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:17.580
affects the way you shoot.
Handle the ball where you bet,
dude,
look at,

1387
01:27:18.050 --> 01:27:22.200
I want to see if I can find this photo.
You'd be like,
Oh shit.
That is,
you know,

1388
01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:25.900
I'm sorry,
I'm going to the Rolodex of decks of my panties were back to the desk.

1389
01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:31.260
I'm trying to think of the hands,
the hands and Dick race.
Yeah.

1390
01:27:31.261 --> 01:27:34.130
And I think you're right.
It's not the hand to Dick,
right?
It's not the hand.

1391
01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:36.620
It's not,
it's a general overall stature.

1392
01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:41.050
Do you think swagger can give girls that there's first of all indication that
no,

1393
01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:43.640
look at this NBA regulation,
basketball.

1394
01:27:45.250 --> 01:27:48.410
I mean his hands are huge.
Oh my God.

1395
01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:53.390
How do girls size up like from a dude,
whether they can try to get an idea,
like,

1396
01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:56.990
is that even a thing?
I don't think he feels pretty good.
It's got to be,

1397
01:27:57.020 --> 01:27:59.720
is that cool water?
Nope.
Tiny Dick.
Or like

1398
01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:02.151
there are guys who I thought,

1399
01:28:02.151 --> 01:28:07.151
Oh surely this is going to be a big dog and it's just not all backwards hat.

1400
01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:09.950
Like you just find something that he's convinced yourself.

1401
01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:13.200
This is what got it goes.
You are a mess Jersey under his Tux.

1402
01:28:13.730 --> 01:28:16.220
This is what got the story going.
This guy here,

1403
01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:21.230
like you don't see that there's actually like a ball basket ball in his hands

1404
01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:24.590
because he's just holding it.
That's crazy.
And you're like,
wait,
what?

1405
01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:29.340
What's going on there?
And,
um,
yeah,
it's like hands.

1406
01:28:30.650 --> 01:28:35.090
Yeah.
That's got to mean something,
right?
Yeah.
I mean this is a kid,

1407
01:28:35.091 --> 01:28:38.900
but still it's,
but then there's guys like Muggsy Bogues where you're like,

1408
01:28:39.890 --> 01:28:44.300
you know,
wait,
so I got distracted by the fix that you've,

1409
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:46.250
you've seen hands like you're like,
all right,
this is,

1410
01:28:46.251 --> 01:28:49.010
these are going to be going in the Rolodex of Dick's.
Right,
right.

1411
01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:54.640
Hold on just a couple thousand hours to get through

1412
01:28:59.790 --> 01:29:01.370
this podcast,
bro.

1413
01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:05.780
<v 6>Bro,
bro,
bro,
Bro.</v>

1414
01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:10.440
Like Christina,
a second to think about on the sticks.

1415
01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:13.313
Okay.

1416
01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:14.721
<v 4>By the way,</v>

1417
01:29:14.721 --> 01:29:17.680
I want that to be the song they played people up to when they give the eulogies

1418
01:29:17.730 --> 01:29:21.530
at my funeral rub,
rub,
rub,
rub that as they walk.
Like they're like,
all right.

1419
01:29:21.531 --> 01:29:24.740
And now here's Mr Tangun is eighth grade PE coach

1420
01:29:28.050 --> 01:29:29.160
<v 6>Adam was a sweet boy.</v>

1421
01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:30.770
<v 4>Brian.
It was,</v>

1422
01:29:30.770 --> 01:29:33.890
you got to deepen your voice and have it sound like you've been smoking 10 packs

1423
01:29:33.891 --> 01:29:38.240
a day for 40 years and have your breath smell just the worst.
Ah,
no.

1424
01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:39.980
And then teach us to shoot underhand free throws.

1425
01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:41.440
<v 3>No,</v>

1426
01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:45.720
I'm going through my [inaudible] going on here telling you that there have been

1427
01:29:45.721 --> 01:29:48.120
shockers where I've been like,
this guy will have an average one,

1428
01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.480
and it was in that moment you're like,
oh,
this will be a normal guys.

1429
01:29:50.490 --> 01:29:51.390
Build is average.

1430
01:29:51.391 --> 01:29:55.020
It's just like a tall lean and then it'll be like underwhelming,

1431
01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:59.190
like highly underwhelming.
I've had that.
I've had modest,

1432
01:29:59.191 --> 01:30:03.930
like really insecure guys who you're tall and now no swagger,

1433
01:30:03.931 --> 01:30:06.500
but you're like,
that one's got a big one.
Oh,

1434
01:30:06.630 --> 01:30:10.620
just because you show on assuming about it.
Kind of meek,

1435
01:30:10.650 --> 01:30:14.100
but big stature.
Tall.
But then that one was big.

1436
01:30:14.250 --> 01:30:19.250
That one guy died at the biggest one and then did you that big sides?

1437
01:30:19.681 --> 01:30:22.590
You have quite some time for the holidays,
but that big one though,

1438
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:26.290
you suspected it would be,
no,
I hadn't.
I don't know.

1439
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:29.520
We're so we're talking about is,
well,
that's the thing.
We know you always hope.

1440
01:30:29.521 --> 01:30:31.770
Here's the thing,
it's like,
it is always hope.

1441
01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:34.800
<v 4>You always want the best gift.
That's right.
Nobody goes like,
oh,</v>

1442
01:30:34.801 --> 01:30:38.730
I hope like you know some,
I met my best friend gets the Barbie Princess car.

1443
01:30:38.731 --> 01:30:39.360
You're like,
no,
I wasn't

1444
01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:42.390
<v 3>right.
Yeah.
That's the thing is you're always hoping it's gonna.
You'd never,</v>

1445
01:30:42.391 --> 01:30:44.390
we really don't know.
It's a crap shoot every time.
Yeah.

1446
01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:47.700
I'm just saying that there's,
when I look back,
it really,

1447
01:30:47.701 --> 01:30:52.150
there really is no formula.
Yeah.
It's kind of like,
you know what it was,

1448
01:30:52.230 --> 01:30:55.620
but you're saying actually you're making the point that you can't,

1449
01:30:55.650 --> 01:30:57.110
it's irrespective.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1450
01:30:57.830 --> 01:31:01.250
<v 4>And do you make a noise if you are like under like is there uh Huh?</v>

1451
01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:05.830
<v 3>No.
No,
but I've had the best moment in porn is,</v>

1452
01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:10.750
oh geeze.
Yeah.
Feel when their light is,
you know,
what's the most,

1453
01:31:12.250 --> 01:31:16.540
the most disappointing Peter's I've had though me when they're real short and

1454
01:31:16.541 --> 01:31:21.310
fat.
Really personally,
that's not my jam.
We have the,
if the,

1455
01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:23.520
the Dick is short and fat,
what does that mean?

1456
01:31:23.530 --> 01:31:28.210
That doesn't tell the story of the,
I can't do it.
What's the,

1457
01:31:28.211 --> 01:31:33.140
I can't,
you're like,
this is too big.
That is not,
that is a story they buy.

1458
01:31:33.490 --> 01:31:36.940
It was,
it was not because of his dick size.
I thought you told me that.

1459
01:31:36.941 --> 01:31:39.340
It was like you're like,
this is too big.
This'll be damaging.

1460
01:31:39.710 --> 01:31:44.170
It wasn't because of that.
Oh No it was because I wasn't a kind of,

1461
01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:48.250
I wasn't into it like cause it doesn't look like it was going to fucking destroy

1462
01:31:48.251 --> 01:31:49.440
you.
That's gotta be a thing.

1463
01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:53.550
<v 4>I feel like if I see one that's that big.
Yeah.
And that's like,
and you're,</v>

1464
01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:57.510
you're in that world of like this is going to be a part of my evening and then

1465
01:31:57.511 --> 01:31:59.620
all sudden it's almost like you go to a restaurant and you're let me get this

1466
01:31:59.621 --> 01:32:00.040
size.
It's,

1467
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:02.470
<v 7>and they bring a real big one.
You're like,
I don't know if I can eat all that.</v>

1468
01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:04.720
There is some,
there is some real equipment out there.

1469
01:32:05.130 --> 01:32:08.950
I've seen videos where I'm like if I was a chick and that thing pulled out,

1470
01:32:08.951 --> 01:32:10.930
I might be like,
oh there was a guy I'm like,

1471
01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:16.390
hold on cause I forgot about that one because I never,
we never did it,

1472
01:32:16.391 --> 01:32:20.200
but I did see it,
you know,
but that guy was small.

1473
01:32:20.830 --> 01:32:22.590
That guy was a guy with small stature.

1474
01:32:22.990 --> 01:32:27.300
You would never freaking now he was a Puerto Rican guy.
He was sure.
Anyway,

1475
01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:31.690
so yeah,
we never was it your race or racism made you not do it?

1476
01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.780
So maybe your next special,

1477
01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:39.010
I mean why wouldn't you do this big Puerto Rican down?
Why?
Because I was,

1478
01:32:39.011 --> 01:32:41.890
I was too sensitive.
Honestly.
It's because I'm not that kind of girl.

1479
01:32:41.890 --> 01:32:44.650
I couldn't do it.
Couldn't have,
I was trying and have a one night stand.

1480
01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:47.650
That's what I was trying to do.
Yeah.
And I,
I'd never done it before.

1481
01:32:47.890 --> 01:32:49.690
You are my first one night stand,
you know that.

1482
01:32:49.691 --> 01:32:53.890
So we ended up fucking marrying the one guy that I tried to do it.
I'm terrible.

1483
01:32:53.891 --> 01:32:58.870
You had you so you're not as,
or at least some booze involved.
Of course.

1484
01:32:58.871 --> 01:33:01.950
I'm joking.
I'm yes.
And then you're like,
you still go and I was like,

1485
01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:04.210
I can't do this.
This is not for me.
How did he handle that?

1486
01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:08.900
Not Well of course it didn't like it as mad and I was like fuck you.
I mean,

1487
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:09.671
you know what I'm saying?
Like,

1488
01:33:09.671 --> 01:33:11.760
I'm the woman I called course you and like be like,

1489
01:33:11.770 --> 01:33:13.660
well maybe we just need to play a game or something.

1490
01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:17.280
That's usually when you hear just the tip.
Did you hear that a lot?
That no,

1491
01:33:17.290 --> 01:33:20.410
not that night but there was another Puerto Rican guy that tried that shit with

1492
01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:23.100
deacons or if you wait,

1493
01:33:23.530 --> 01:33:28.530
so the producers of Dick Detectives because how many Rican Puerto Rican guy and

1494
01:33:28.721 --> 01:33:32.350
I did not do it with him,
but he did try to just the tip me,
I swear to God

1495
01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:39.220
it was the,
it was during,
I was like college,

1496
01:33:39.221 --> 01:33:44.040
this is like around junior year and this guy did try to do it.
He goes,
no,
no,

1497
01:33:44.050 --> 01:33:45.850
come on just,
and I was like,
you don't have a condom.

1498
01:33:45.851 --> 01:33:49.620
I'm not going to have sex with you.
Like,
and he's like,
no,
no,
no dude,

1499
01:33:49.630 --> 01:33:52.570
this is the 90s when like they tell you that aids is rampant.

1500
01:33:52.571 --> 01:33:55.720
This is different Puerto Rican guy.
And how far did you get though?
I did not.

1501
01:33:55.721 --> 01:33:58.340
I did not fuck me because we'd have anything.
You know what I mean?

1502
01:33:58.970 --> 01:34:02.980
Don't you get started before you get out,
you're making out.
And then he's like,

1503
01:34:03.190 --> 01:34:06.130
come on man.
He's like trying to talk me into it.
And I was like,
no bro,

1504
01:34:06.131 --> 01:34:07.240
cause this is the night.
Like I said,

1505
01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:11.470
I was very nervous and that says tds and fucking aids and shit.

1506
01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:13.780
Yeah.
He didn't say just a tip.

1507
01:34:13.781 --> 01:34:17.410
You just say that phrase but it was that just the tip thing?
Yeah.
Just come on,

1508
01:34:17.411 --> 01:34:21.640
let me just,
let me just read through it.
Just feel that I've got a great urethra.

1509
01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:25.960
Yeah.
Why?
Why is the tip always been so like is that the best part now?

1510
01:34:26.170 --> 01:34:30.430
Because he thinks if he can get in and of course
you'll want the rest of it.

1511
01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:35.050
Just seeing who's agreeable.
Cause if you go,
come on just the tip.

1512
01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:37.750
And the girl was like,
all right,
you're like,
she's down.
She just wanted,

1513
01:34:38.190 --> 01:34:40.180
she just wanted to get a little pushback on it.

1514
01:34:41.070 --> 01:34:45.640
Your girl is very paranoid of disease and I couldn't do it.
Come on.

1515
01:34:45.641 --> 01:34:46.474
And you were like,

1516
01:34:50.910 --> 01:34:52.120
it's your voice.

1517
01:34:56.290 --> 01:34:57.123
I lost my voice.

1518
01:34:59.650 --> 01:35:03.770
<v 4>Yep.
That's very rude.
Inconsiderate.
He's right there.
Yeah.
That's so rude.</v>

1519
01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:06.590
Do you want to know where I saw some crazy Dick's recently.
At least it's insane.

1520
01:35:06.591 --> 01:35:09.630
And I post on Instagram and Instagram took it down.
Oh.
Um,

1521
01:35:09.950 --> 01:35:13.770
upgrading myself to a little first class seating.
Right.
Nice.
And uh,

1522
01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:18.110
always don't feed on Delta.
Got the hot towel,
got the weird cookie.

1523
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:23.090
And um,
there's a guy two rows in front of me and it's dark.
It's a night flight.

1524
01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:26.060
Austin.
I see him on his iPad scrolling through.
I still,
I'm sorry,
phone,

1525
01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:30.260
I'm just kind of like look over it.
And also I'm just like,
oh,
those are dicks.

1526
01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:32.930
All those are,
those are butt's,

1527
01:35:34.740 --> 01:35:38.300
your butt's taking Dick's,
those,
their boobs.

1528
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:41.100
And this guy is just going through an airplane.

1529
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:43.430
This dude in the front row of the thing.
So like,

1530
01:35:43.810 --> 01:35:46.550
and he's just filing through as if he's got all these,

1531
01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:50.480
it's a gay person.

1532
01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:55.590
He had a wife right next to him.
She was,
um,

1533
01:35:55.850 --> 01:35:58.610
I don't know what ethnicity,

1534
01:35:58.611 --> 01:36:02.690
but she had a big garb on and he's scrolling through all these saved videos.

1535
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:07.630
And at first it's just like black people fucking,
and then it's like,
uh,

1536
01:36:07.650 --> 01:36:11.270
just dicks Wa there's old men walking around flopping dicks.

1537
01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:13.550
It was this whole grab bag of like,

1538
01:36:13.551 --> 01:36:18.320
where are you thinking in third row,
second row.

1539
01:36:18.321 --> 01:36:20.900
And he's in first row to the left and I'm on the right at the window.

1540
01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:25.590
He's on the aisle first row and I'm right behind him on the aisle.

1541
01:36:25.591 --> 01:36:28.910
So I'm like diagonal.
So I'm like,
and I'm just like,

1542
01:36:28.911 --> 01:36:31.880
what is happening to just casually actually scrolling through,

1543
01:36:31.881 --> 01:36:35.030
like he's looking at menu items of the cheesecake for what you're doing when

1544
01:36:35.031 --> 01:36:38.090
you're next to me on your iPhone looking at fucking,

1545
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:41.330
and he would stop on the weirdest videos and then all of a sudden like I would

1546
01:36:41.331 --> 01:36:45.890
never be,
I'm not,
see,
I'm too fucking paranoid and to,

1547
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:50.060
I'm too private and personal to,
to do something like that publicly.

1548
01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:53.810
I look at crazy shit,
a alone,
but never in a public space.

1549
01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:56.300
I just be too paranoid.
Yeah,
no.

1550
01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:59.840
Also like what if like the stores is just all of a sudden you're so in your porn

1551
01:36:59.841 --> 01:37:01.110
world,
I would never

1552
01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:05.780
want the public shaming,
you know,

1553
01:37:05.781 --> 01:37:08.870
obviously like she'd have to say something or he,
right.
Well they should,

1554
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:13.000
if you got kicked off for that you shut.
Yeah.
You,
you in there.

1555
01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:17.990
I took a video,
I posted it on Instagram and people were posting like,
yeah.

1556
01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:20.270
And uh,
cause I was just like,
you know,

1557
01:37:20.300 --> 01:37:22.760
and I even took like a little picture of this guy and was going to add that to

1558
01:37:22.761 --> 01:37:26.150
it.
And then a,
but Instagram took the video down after about 10 minutes,

1559
01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:29.140
read tons of comments on people.
Just,
I mean,

1560
01:37:29.141 --> 01:37:31.100
a lot of people being like this just gross.
Why did you post this?

1561
01:37:31.101 --> 01:37:33.160
And then we will still have it on your phone by the way.

1575
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.870
How did you become fascinated with this flick?
Uh,

1576
01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:34.650
because I didn't think it was real.
Those are the best.

1577
01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:35.730
We haven't even watched the movie.

1578
01:38:35.731 --> 01:38:40.200
We've just seen the trailer and the trailer doesn't seem real and the trailer is

1579
01:38:40.201 --> 01:38:44.880
real love that.
Um,

invested a lot of money.

1580
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:47.370
Well,

So here's,

1585
01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:05.670
this is a real trailer cause I know you're going to be like,

1586
01:39:05.970 --> 01:39:08.120
This doesn't seem right else by the way.
I love movies.

1587
01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:12.110
<v 8>Carolyn Steven's life together.
It was perfect</v>

1588
01:39:15.310 --> 01:39:19.620
roles.
Yeah.
Like,
hey baby.
Hey,
low job.

1589
01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:25.190
And not yet.
There's one small problem.
Hi,
I'm rolling.

1590
01:39:25.290 --> 01:39:26.920
I'm his brother.
Which twins?

1591
01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:32.750
He can tear them apart.

1592
01:39:33.170 --> 01:39:36.910
I think you've got to let me know that everyone in your pants is images,
images,

1593
01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:39.380
Carolyn doors.
What afterwards bring them to.

1594
01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:45.250
Hey,
welcome.
I'm Steven.
There you are.

1595
01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:48.910
This is Steven's father Bruno and his mom Kathleen and over behind the bio

1596
01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:52.570
students
who could have prepared us for this.
Don't you think?

1597
01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:55.170
Battersby I'll never speak to cancer.
Just get it together.

1598
01:39:56.340 --> 01:40:01.260
Maybe I'm pregnant when the going gets rough.
It's only the size of your heart,

1599
01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:04.480
that big of a deal.
If a kid a door,

1600
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:07.890
you not this great girl and you didn't tell her that her baby's probably got to

1601
01:40:07.891 --> 01:40:09.180
be a the door voice.

1602
01:40:09.210 --> 01:40:13.020
We also cute and cuddly discriminate against us.

1603
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:18.160
<v 7>Did bridges this and let me do the trailer for it.
Yeah.</v>

1604
01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:21.900
How bad is the voiceover so bad?
This guy doesn't add studies,

1605
01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:25.000
was barely reading copy.
He's just like Mikaila is in it.

1606
01:40:25.001 --> 01:40:27.340
Then a midget shows up Becken sails freaked out.

1607
01:40:27.370 --> 01:40:29.950
She doesn't know if she gets stuck off a guy who brothers with the music,

1608
01:40:29.951 --> 01:40:33.250
the Vo for the,
for the trailer.
He's like,

1609
01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:35.560
they didn't know what would happen next.

1610
01:40:35.561 --> 01:40:39.310
Like it has a very not for it sounds like he was auditioning for the part and

1611
01:40:39.311 --> 01:40:42.370
they were like,
yeah,
we might give it to you yet.
Hey,
do we have any of the,

1612
01:40:42.371 --> 01:40:46.510
the uh,
demos from the auditions just top line it up.

1613
01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:48.490
We're not going to hire a real guy.
If he did

1614
01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:51.130
<v 8>and he's got a little wild.
I never expected</v>

1615
01:40:54.490 --> 01:40:57.040
Goldie Hawn.
My Nick can do what he wants to do.

1616
01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:02.980
Relationship.
What is this man doing?
A new about doing

1617
01:41:05.970 --> 01:41:06.803
Matthew.

1618
01:41:07.010 --> 01:41:11.280
<v 4>Hey,
Gary Oldman.
Hot tubs in midgets.
Was that the ultimate title?</v>

1619
01:41:11.370 --> 01:41:13.680
I'll walk down the aisle.
Oh yeah.

1620
01:41:13.681 --> 01:41:16.140
This guy sounds like he had demoed like a t-mobile employee.

1621
01:41:17.130 --> 01:41:20.460
What he's like when you show up to the store after five,

1622
01:41:20.670 --> 01:41:24.330
remember to put the cases back where you found them.
Makana Hayes heart.

1623
01:41:24.331 --> 01:41:28.140
Let's hope it's big enough.
He does keep this marriage going.
That's exactly it.

1624
01:41:28.141 --> 01:41:31.830
And here's,
here's his that can sales in it too.
She's great.
You're like,
okay,

1625
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:34.620
now he's just giving personal.
Here's this,
here's the final.

1626
01:41:34.621 --> 01:41:37.440
But then you leave our admins a little man.
The final title now.

1627
01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:39.210
<v 8>Ooh,
said Langley productions.</v>

1628
01:41:39.211 --> 01:41:44.070
Probably present command performances from Kate Beckinsale.
Matthew mcconahey.

1629
01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:47.940
Nope.
And in the role of a lifetime,

1630
01:41:48.610 --> 01:41:53.610
it's one way of role of a lifetime whole lead to shit.

1631
01:41:54.450 --> 01:41:54.690
Brad

1632
01:41:54.690 --> 01:41:58.470
<v 4>know about this.
I wish we would've played it for him when he was here.</v>

1633
01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:02.850
I think it was.
It was after.
Oh my God.
Do you think,
wait a minute,

1634
01:42:02.910 --> 01:42:06.300
did bridges the midget have to change her name to bridge?
It's a little person.

1635
01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:10.380
You mean now?
Yeah,
that's a good question.
I Dunno.
Wait a minute.

1636
01:42:10.381 --> 01:42:13.350
How do you think now do you think in the pitch meeting guy and he's like,

1637
01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:16.670
oh look,
I'm very excited for this new movie you guys,

1638
01:42:17.550 --> 01:42:20.880
you know I've been loving to work with and sale at some point,
right?

1639
01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:23.730
Oldman John Fan.
No,
no.

1640
01:42:23.731 --> 01:42:28.200
Bigger fan of old man and they go,
we're going to say mcconahey for the trailer.

1641
01:42:28.230 --> 01:42:33.180
We'll talk about it.
I've never heard it pronounced that way either.
Right?

1642
01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:37.950
That was different.
You can't really see it but I can see it.
Wait,
so what's,

1643
01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:40.650
I mean are you going to have a viewing party?

1644
01:42:40.650 --> 01:42:44.310
Because I need to know does Oldman rip them apart because Kate's like,

1645
01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:45.720
I don't know it didn't you say at one point like,

1646
01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:48.900
I dunno if I can go through with this because they're about to get married.

1647
01:42:48.930 --> 01:42:49.763
They're about to,

1648
01:42:49.770 --> 01:42:54.270
but then all the sudden Dorf Oldman shows up and throws a curve ball into

1649
01:42:54.271 --> 01:42:57.990
Macanta Dick Gregory
and then she's like,

1650
01:42:57.991 --> 01:43:01.650
am I going to have a dwarf baby?
Does she,
is that a concern?
The major concern.

1651
01:43:01.890 --> 01:43:06.330
Whoa.
This is like very anti dwarf,

1652
01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:11.490
kind of feels like it kind of,
it is.
Uh,
yeah,
like couldn't make this movie.

1653
01:43:11.491 --> 01:43:13.290
Now here's the trivia in it.

1654
01:43:13.291 --> 01:43:16.550
So it's a good thing he didn't show it to bread cause that's like true nemesis.

1655
01:43:17.250 --> 01:43:20.760
Oh yeah.
Wait for real.
For Real.
Yeah.
We train them on it,
on Twitter and bread.

1656
01:43:22.230 --> 01:43:26.940
I Dunno.
Just like their God.
Yeah.
Is that why?
Maybe.

1657
01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:29.730
Yeah,
no,
I think maybe it's,
maybe it's one of those things where he was like,

1658
01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:32.780
I think Brad's people were too,
where he's like,
he looks up to the amps,

1659
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:36.390
the envelopes,
loops.
So people were like,
[inaudible] is your guy.
And he's like,

1660
01:43:36.391 --> 01:43:40.140
don't tell me how to live my life.
You know,
he likes to,
I like whoever I wanted.

1661
01:43:40.390 --> 01:43:43.920
Yes.
Don't tell me who I have to idolize like that.
Yeah,
I agree.

1662
01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:46.950
But also I feel like maybe intake,
which gets a lot of parts,

1663
01:43:46.951 --> 01:43:49.800
I think that Brad would like,
oh,
sure.
Yeah.
Um,

1664
01:43:50.490 --> 01:43:52.040
here's some of the right now and I

1665
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:56.390
<v 7>MDB for tiptoes.
Director,</v>

1666
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:59.870
uh,
Matthew Bright was fired after you turned in his cut the whole,

1667
01:43:59.930 --> 01:44:02.990
the whole film was then re edited.
Yeah,

1668
01:44:03.020 --> 01:44:06.350
that's a great moment where he plays it for everybody and they just go,

1669
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:08.870
do you think it's immediate where they watch it at the end of Oldman?

1670
01:44:08.871 --> 01:44:11.930
The last line,
let's just hypothesize.
Oldman just goes.

1671
01:44:12.290 --> 01:44:15.290
So I guess I'll just grab my shoes and leave.

1672
01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:17.390
Mcconaughey goes Shari.

1673
01:44:17.470 --> 01:44:21.650
But we're going to have a baby and he goes,
fine.

1674
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:25.790
Fuck you.
Credits.
And they can just turns around and goes,
you're fired,

1675
01:44:25.820 --> 01:44:28.630
you're fired.
And then this is the good version.
This is the,

1676
01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:34.160
this was Rhea and Peter Dinklage said that the original director's cut,

1677
01:44:34.161 --> 01:44:38.540
which screen in Austin was gorgeous,
but the people who fired,
uh,

1678
01:44:38.570 --> 01:44:41.790
Matthew Bright ruin the movie who recut it?
Like what did,

1679
01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:43.700
I don't know cause I'd love to see what else he did.

1680
01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:48.480
Did he do like fried green tomatoes or,
um,
good point.
You know,

1681
01:44:48.890 --> 01:44:52.520
I see this again,
the trailer,
they're trying to make it into like a Romcom,

1682
01:44:52.521 --> 01:44:53.420
like a comedy.

1683
01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:57.290
And I have a feeling the way that it was shot was probably more respectful of

1684
01:44:57.291 --> 01:44:59.870
dwarves and of the story.
And then they were like,
hey,

1685
01:44:59.871 --> 01:45:02.460
you got to make this for the general audience.
You've got it.

1686
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:05.210
Let's make this a wacky comedy.
And you're like,
but it's not funny.

1687
01:45:06.130 --> 01:45:10.100
I'm sort of wondering,
so what year was this?
Cause oh three.
It's not that we're,

1688
01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:11.660
you've been around for a while.
Like,

1689
01:45:11.690 --> 01:45:14.850
are we that throwing off that one could show up and all of a sudden enter the

1690
01:45:14.851 --> 01:45:19.340
family being the,
uh,
the like that reaction when the mother's like,

1691
01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:22.760
yeah,
that was great.
Like,
what are you telling me?
Are there black people?

1692
01:45:24.890 --> 01:45:28.230
She was really,
really react if a black too often walked in shoe.

1693
01:45:30.030 --> 01:45:33.180
Um,
here's some other of the trivia that's on the page.
Sure,
sure.

1694
01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:37.010
Gary Oldman kept his jeans extremely high end tire for the entire film,
uh,

1695
01:45:37.011 --> 01:45:40.290
to create the illusion of a small person after initial criticism.

1696
01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:41.570
Gary Oldman was quoted as saying,

1697
01:45:41.571 --> 01:45:45.970
just try it out grilled and said he was fired by his favorite musicians.

1698
01:45:45.980 --> 01:45:48.680
Garth Brooks in the four stroke gang.
Okay.
Oh,

1699
01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:52.100
this film has been held in high regard for its soundtrack,

1700
01:45:52.130 --> 01:45:56.120
including the original song.
Good mornings.
Really,
yet by gene mix,
ceiling fan

1701
01:46:00.430 --> 01:46:04.370
genes are everywhere.
They're everywhere are everywhere on the Internet.

1702
01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:08.320
So I asked you this,
um,
a while back before we jumped around that.

1703
01:46:08.350 --> 01:46:11.940
Who did you know who,
good morning Julia.
Well,
that referred to know,

1704
01:46:12.230 --> 01:46:17.090
so that referred to,
um,
something that's really blown up on this show,

1705
01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:22.120
which is a young lady named Julia One day was that the gym left the tanning bed

1706
01:46:23.271 --> 01:46:23.780
at the gym,

1707
01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:28.190
went to her car and a man followed her out of the gym and said her name.

1708
01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:31.490
And the reason he knew her name was because you sign in at the gym.

1709
01:46:31.730 --> 01:46:36.710
So he was like Julia,
Julia.
Oh No.
She was like,
her name is Julia.
Julia.
Well,
yeah,

1710
01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:40.640
exactly.
[inaudible] name is Julie.
Okay.
And he was like,
hey.
And she was like,

1711
01:46:40.641 --> 01:46:41.474
do I know you?

1712
01:46:41.510 --> 01:46:44.990
And the reason he knew her name was because he saw the sign and creepy.

1713
01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:47.210
Never thought that.
That is such an easy way.

1714
01:46:47.390 --> 01:46:50.160
It's like when kids used to wear names on their sweatshirts,

1715
01:46:50.180 --> 01:46:53.240
<v 4>you know?
Absolutely.
Yes.
I did that as a kid and that's,</v>

1716
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:57.180
we'll put a pin in that story.
Well he,
so he followed her out and she was nice.

1717
01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:01.770
Like basically he,
she was like in a,
in a polite roundabout way was like,

1718
01:47:01.771 --> 01:47:05.010
I'm not interested.
Um,
but he was like,
let me get your number.

1719
01:47:05.190 --> 01:47:09.420
And she was holding her phone so she was like,
why don't you put your number in?

1720
01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:12.840
So like I have it.
So he put his number in and then dial his phone.

1721
01:47:13.170 --> 01:47:17.220
So he got her phone number.
But anyways,
she was like,
that's that.

1722
01:47:17.370 --> 01:47:22.140
She goes home and the next morning she gets this on her phone.

1723
01:47:22.590 --> 01:47:27.240
Good morning,
Julia made Joe.
Just wanted to say hi.

1724
01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:29.070
Wish you a great day.

1725
01:47:29.730 --> 01:47:34.500
Tell you that meeting you yesterday and getting a look at you was probably one

1726
01:47:34.501 --> 01:47:37.590
of the greatest moments of my life.
You are so beautiful.

1727
01:47:38.190 --> 01:47:42.720
You don't know how beautiful you are to me.
I mean just,
you're gorgeous.

1728
01:47:42.721 --> 01:47:46.080
You're precious.
So it goes on.

1729
01:47:46.100 --> 01:47:48.630
It goes off in my mind when you said to me,

1730
01:47:48.631 --> 01:47:52.950
you want to go back with your ex boyfriend,
please erase him from your memory.

1731
01:47:53.250 --> 01:47:54.630
Don't ever go back in the past.

1732
01:47:54.631 --> 01:47:59.190
I know men in black light in there and I understand when you know you're trying

1733
01:47:59.191 --> 01:48:04.191
to find somebody and you go on dates and nothing compares to your rack.

1734
01:48:04.710 --> 01:48:09.540
It's a lot.
There is that better person out there with morphine.
Julia,

1735
01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:12.630
I promise you it is.
May Open up your heart.

1736
01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:17.130
Okay to make in your arms open up,
be highly aggressive.
The ocean style.

1737
01:48:17.131 --> 01:48:21.390
Get Out of my dreams,
get into my car.
It's,
it's nuts.

1738
01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:26.970
As he purposely given like the cribs tour in the background I'm like is he very

1739
01:48:26.971 --> 01:48:30.040
inconspicuous each other.
Good luck and I got a dope kitchen case.

1740
01:48:30.050 --> 01:48:33.750
You want to come over
all this myself,

1741
01:48:33.751 --> 01:48:36.270
the trim this goatee or let it grow more,
whatever you want.

1742
01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:41.900
And then he sent her a follow up video shortly that she respond to that or this.

1743
01:48:42.530 --> 01:48:46.530
No,
just want to say good morning.
Get you to know I could wear hats like this.

1744
01:48:48.940 --> 01:48:52.920
No nicknames yet.
Dude.
My soon to be my everything.
Holy Shit.

1745
01:48:53.220 --> 01:48:57.570
I have a great day.
Love.
Oh,
straining order table for one.

1746
01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:03.360
Just waiting on it now how many,
how many ones he sent?

1747
01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:08.790
Oh my God.
And this is,
you know,
and it's so stuff like that that I go,
Oh man,

1748
01:49:08.791 --> 01:49:10.560
like you know,

1749
01:49:10.561 --> 01:49:14.190
not that I don't feel bad when I hear these creeper stories from guys,

1750
01:49:14.191 --> 01:49:18.060
but it's like when you see video evidence you're like,
oh yeah,

1751
01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:21.150
like there was a girls dating in college.
I remember her,

1752
01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:23.970
she was at a bar and she gave a number to a guy because we were dating and she

1753
01:49:23.971 --> 01:49:27.000
was like,
I just felt bad.
And I was like,
don't do that.

1754
01:49:27.001 --> 01:49:30.750
Like there's these going to send you weird shit now.
And he did.

1755
01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:35.460
And a horse like she was terrified.
She was terrified.

1756
01:49:37.770 --> 01:49:40.320
But then like she eventually,

1757
01:49:40.321 --> 01:49:43.200
well like people started to send her videos of him like working out.

1758
01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:46.770
I could be workout buddies.
I think you need a spotter in life.

1759
01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:47.950
And the gym he got,

1760
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:51.880
<v 7>he got the hint and,
but like when he didn't seem like he would,</v>

1761
01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:55.780
that seemed like a video web series ready to be made.

1762
01:49:55.781 --> 01:49:59.410
She probably has a certain point actually blocked him if I,
that's all it takes.

1763
01:49:59.411 --> 01:50:03.190
Right?
I'm sure.
Well she eventually got,
she thought it was funny after awhile.

1764
01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:06.640
Oh cool.
You know,
once you got some distance from it,
she got the first one.

1765
01:50:06.641 --> 01:50:09.700
She was so mortified that she didn't share with anybody cause she was like,

1766
01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:12.190
oh my God,
this is so bad.
And there's a thing he didn't seem,

1767
01:50:12.191 --> 01:50:15.010
he seemed like a kind of affable guy that was kind of like,
you're dumb.

1768
01:50:15.011 --> 01:50:18.340
Like almost like your boner from growing pains and your group of friends to

1769
01:50:18.341 --> 01:50:20.130
where like you're hanging out and you're like,
hey dude,

1770
01:50:20.131 --> 01:50:24.010
that thing with your goatee or like make that fart noise or like something

1771
01:50:24.011 --> 01:50:26.320
stupid where he had some weird human trick but then,

1772
01:50:26.650 --> 01:50:28.180
then you'd see him talk to women and you're like,

1773
01:50:28.210 --> 01:50:29.620
we should probably get out of here.
You know,

1774
01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:33.220
cause he's gonna like take it up a notch and fall in love and start calling

1775
01:50:33.221 --> 01:50:35.020
girls flour.
You know,

1776
01:50:36.690 --> 01:50:41.290
he doesn't have it but it's coming from us that they can't just keep fucking

1777
01:50:41.291 --> 01:50:45.460
harassing.
Check.
Look,
you call her wine,
she doesn't answer.
That's it.

1778
01:50:45.461 --> 01:50:49.630
She's not fucking interested in you bro.
Like stock got your video.
She got it.

1779
01:50:50.170 --> 01:50:52.960
I took in maybe like don't put the ceiling fan in it next time.

1780
01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:57.070
It's everything backdrop matters though,
right?

1781
01:50:57.071 --> 01:50:59.500
If you're going to get a home video,
a selfie video,

1782
01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:02.790
you'd be in the hot tub or maybe like,
I dunno,

1783
01:51:02.830 --> 01:51:05.740
I dunno what the move is like be beholding the parakeet or something.

1784
01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:07.060
You don't even know half of the show.

1785
01:51:07.061 --> 01:51:09.220
She eventually baited him cause she was like,

1786
01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:14.150
when she finally found the humor in it,
she was like,
I want to do like,

1787
01:51:14.170 --> 01:51:16.810
I want to get another one of these.
Cause she eventually thought it was funny.

1788
01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:20.560
Oh that's her and her friends were like,
send us another video.
Oh boy did

1789
01:51:22.090 --> 01:51:25.850
mom's house exclusive.
We thought for real and share it with you and discuss.

1790
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:28.260
I haven't been this excited since.
Cool.
Runnings.
Hit DVD.

1791
01:51:28.990 --> 01:51:32.290
Just one is it is the exclusive.

1792
01:51:33.250 --> 01:51:36.580
We'll be back to talking less the wrong thing.
Here we go.

1793
01:51:37.220 --> 01:51:39.930
This is a [inaudible] exclusive.

1794
01:51:42.850 --> 01:51:45.550
All right.
That's why you guys are the best by the way.

1795
01:51:46.060 --> 01:51:49.630
Little things like that go a long way.
Uh,
but this is the video.

1796
01:51:49.631 --> 01:51:51.670
This is the last one she got from who sing.

1797
01:51:52.890 --> 01:51:54.730
See I'm half asleep on the couch.

1798
01:51:57.580 --> 01:52:00.070
There's a pointed you got me wrapped around your finger

1799
01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:04.000
but that's all you get.
I'm exhausted.

1800
01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:10.050
<v 12>Too</v>

1801
01:52:10.050 --> 01:52:13.260
<v 7>much of a delay before a kiss is bad news.</v>

1802
01:52:14.550 --> 01:52:19.350
Do kisses like that.
Why does it hurt my soul?
It hurts.
It hurts my stomach.

1803
01:52:19.351 --> 01:52:23.700
Just my stomach hurts and barriers.
In 10 years you'd be like,
Hey,

1804
01:52:24.420 --> 01:52:26.490
oh wait,
play it again.
It's so like

1805
01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:31.410
I feel like that's the end of his commercial when he was like,
hey it's me.

1806
01:52:31.620 --> 01:52:33.530
What's his name again?
Joe.
Joe.

1807
01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:38.900
Come on down to Joe's syrup farm where you can get the best syrup in Tallahassee

1808
01:52:40.250 --> 01:52:44.910
and he does that.
He does that like self imposed sexy laugh.

1809
01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:49.610
He was like,
you know,
like it's like just hanging on the couch.

1810
01:52:49.670 --> 01:52:53.570
Too sexy to get up.
Yes.
Whoa.
Wrapped around my finger.

1811
01:52:53.930 --> 01:52:57.530
This is all you're getting.
See this one he went,
he's old.
He went full.

1812
01:52:57.531 --> 01:52:59.090
Tried to see.
He's less desperate.

1813
01:52:59.150 --> 01:53:04.150
The reason he's less desperate in this one is because she prompted him to send

1814
01:53:04.311 --> 01:53:07.280
something.
So all like he's so eager and the other ones,

1815
01:53:07.281 --> 01:53:10.170
cause he doesn't know what's going to get now he's sitting back being loud.

1816
01:53:11.660 --> 01:53:15.050
Who's coming to me now?
I guess I can chill on the couch to that first one.

1817
01:53:15.051 --> 01:53:17.510
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't think I have to do any production value.

1818
01:53:17.511 --> 01:53:21.890
If that is the first one had to like,
I will find you.
I will follow you.

1819
01:53:21.891 --> 01:53:26.090
I will end things five.
And now he's like,
oh,
she's interested.

1820
01:53:26.210 --> 01:53:30.920
So when someone's interested,
you feel like you can do,
uh,
you know,

1821
01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:32.353
kind of

1822
01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:40.990
came around,
you know,
that's why I get a swag I like too,

1823
01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:45.110
is the forced spontaneity.
I'm like,
I'm just here laying on my couch

1824
01:53:47.710 --> 01:53:50.900
laid down before that maybe.
Do you think you practice

1825
01:53:53.370 --> 01:53:54.203
or like,

1826
01:53:55.340 --> 01:54:00.340
I should've done a long a beat between the last word have held out longer before

1827
01:54:00.561 --> 01:54:03.980
the smooch noise.
Tell you to smooch seals the deal.

1828
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:09.980
Pause a four second.
You feel it out,
dude.
It's weird,
but be on the couch for it.

1829
01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:11.473
Um,

1830
01:54:11.530 --> 01:54:15.470
what about the floor got me wrapped around your finger with this is all you get.

1831
01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:17.660
I want to know what he was anticipating.

1832
01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:19.730
He might give her if she did ask for more though.

1833
01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:24.560
You know what does she texted back?
Don't let that be it.
Oh,
you want more?

1834
01:54:24.561 --> 01:54:28.350
Huh?
Well let's move to the bathroom change.

1835
01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:34.480
I bet.
What if,
what if she had baited him with like a fake God?

1836
01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:37.400
She was like,
let me see that.
Oh,
we don't know what this guy's capable of.

1837
01:54:37.401 --> 01:54:40.880
Oh yeah.
What do you think?
That's where it draws the line.
He,
yeah,
you're right.

1838
01:54:40.881 --> 01:54:43.120
He wouldn't be awesome.
Became a gentleman and he was like,
Julia,

1839
01:54:43.121 --> 01:54:46.680
I'm a classy guy.
I thought you were classy.
Not Interested.

1840
01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:50.040
That would be the best thing.
That's awesome.
God.

1841
01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:52.670
Now you want me to reopen this exchange?
The Joe.

1842
01:54:52.671 --> 01:54:56.120
What if Julia were to respond now and be like,
I'm ready.
It's been a few years.

1843
01:54:58.610 --> 01:55:01.280
All these guys were wrong.
You were always right and lucky for you.

1844
01:55:01.281 --> 01:55:04.400
I've still been on my couch.
He's got to know by now,
right?

1845
01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:09.580
That show that people are sending in their own jove videos.

1846
01:55:09.610 --> 01:55:11.390
Oh,
by the hundreds.
Oh boy.

1847
01:55:11.650 --> 01:55:15.320
Like they've just been nonstop kids.
You know,

1848
01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:17.383
yesterday,

1849
01:55:24.930 --> 01:55:28.100
Julie,
my favorites.
So many.

1850
01:55:28.670 --> 01:55:32.920
Not like your ex boyfriend.
I just wanted to show you the ceiling

1851
01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:39.770
demonstrate so we can,

1852
01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:44.640
when we go full throttle,
Julia,
I think.

1853
01:55:46.260 --> 01:55:48.110
Yes dude.
All right.
That guy went forward.

1854
01:55:48.750 --> 01:55:53.460
Now the best would be if you get a surprise video from Garth Brooks backstage at

1855
01:55:53.461 --> 01:55:55.690
his concert being like Julian back here,

1856
01:55:58.050 --> 01:56:02.280
getting ready to perform for you.
20,000 people screaming your name,

1857
01:56:02.850 --> 01:56:06.050
screaming my name,
screaming,
your name,
family if Garth.

1858
01:56:06.620 --> 01:56:10.020
And that's how he tells you and that's how he lets you know like nothing else.

1859
01:56:10.021 --> 01:56:14.410
He just sends you that dude.
Why are you tease me?
Like,
sorry dude.

1860
01:56:14.430 --> 01:56:16.060
Now that would be amazing.
Yeah,

1861
01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:19.020
that would do nothing but Garth promos for the rest.

1862
01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:24.060
God's got a show coming up in Florida tomorrow nights.
Seven 30

1863
01:56:25.700 --> 01:56:26.111
question.

1864
01:56:26.111 --> 01:56:30.060
Do you think that if Joe has been made aware of the relentless taunting that

1865
01:56:30.061 --> 01:56:33.990
we'd been giving him,
learn the error of his ways,

1866
01:56:33.991 --> 01:56:38.991
do you think that this experience would have changed if he's cognizant enough to

1867
01:56:39.031 --> 01:56:41.280
recognize the humor in what's happened

1868
01:56:43.350 --> 01:56:47.700
now to realize that what he did to Juliet was so fucking inappropriate and
wrong?

1869
01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:51.810
I think he's just like,
she wasn't for me anyway.

1870
01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:56.460
Some part of his mind flowers out there that's in him for sure.

1871
01:56:56.490 --> 01:57:01.490
There's a part of this that you should hear to answer that question because this

1872
01:57:01.890 --> 01:57:06.570
phrase in particular shows that in the moment when he sent the original one,

1873
01:57:07.020 --> 01:57:09.840
he had some awareness.
Correct.
And here is the phrase,

1874
01:57:10.230 --> 01:57:12.930
this is the type of guy you got.
I'm a very handy guy.

1875
01:57:14.150 --> 01:57:17.940
I love to build you whatever you want.
You're a sweetheart.

1876
01:57:18.270 --> 01:57:21.090
So I hope this video doesn't scare you.
There it is.

1877
01:57:21.390 --> 01:57:23.290
That's how I feel now is that it scared.
Okay.

1878
01:57:23.310 --> 01:57:25.590
See you or have enough awareness to go,

1879
01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:30.870
I hope this video didn't scare you because he knows a debt now that was it scary

1880
01:57:30.871 --> 01:57:35.560
or to say that,
you know what I'm saying?
Where it's like,
I don't know.

1881
01:57:35.570 --> 01:57:38.000
I mean whole like prefacing it with that thing that you like.

1882
01:57:38.290 --> 01:57:40.470
Is it scary like right?
He knows,

1883
01:57:40.471 --> 01:57:44.550
but he knows it's an aggressive move to send someone like a three minute video

1884
01:57:44.551 --> 01:57:49.110
the day after you met them in a parking lot that that what fall down did he say,

1885
01:57:49.111 --> 01:57:50.250
no,
I don't want this to scare you,

1886
01:57:50.251 --> 01:57:54.270
but I feel like we should be together all the time from here on out and you

1887
01:57:54.271 --> 01:57:57.210
should leave your x and I can help you kill them.
Don't be scared.

1888
01:57:57.570 --> 01:57:58.470
Don't be scared.

1889
01:57:59.770 --> 01:58:03.420
That put his head in my ceiling fan videos of scare you.

1890
01:58:04.260 --> 01:58:08.600
What'd he say after that?
Right after that gold Trump type of guy.
Again,

1891
01:58:08.790 --> 01:58:12.910
I'm a very scare you,
but that's how I feel.
I feel.

1892
01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:17.070
I just want you to know that I look forward.
I'm going out to dinner with,

1893
01:58:17.071 --> 01:58:21.980
you know,
so let's make it happen.
Oh God.

1894
01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:27.140
Oh,
so that's his calling card.
His mood.
It's closer.
Oh,

1895
01:58:27.150 --> 01:58:30.820
you still doing the kiss,
kiss,
kiss love.
They love the,
come on,
come on man.

1896
01:58:31.750 --> 01:58:35.310
By the way,
you think that's,
that's his first date to like,
instead of like,

1897
01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:37.560
he just stands five feet away from him and just goes all right.

1898
01:58:37.950 --> 01:58:42.160
Ucla and backs away and just like those,
the side,
not

1899
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:46.780
<v 0>even a real kiss.
No,
it's the first day baby.
You've got to come inside for that.</v>

1900
01:58:49.320 --> 01:58:52.870
Let's see.
I was telling her,
I feel like I ever did that.

1901
01:58:52.871 --> 01:58:57.610
Like that it was never a thing in the forties or 50s I feel he oddly does for

1902
01:58:57.611 --> 01:59:00.900
his romantic interest.
Things that you would do for it.
Like a child.
Yeah.

1903
01:59:01.140 --> 01:59:03.230
Did you see like a kid you might go ah,

1904
01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:07.870
yeah cause you over exaggerating or a dog,
that kind of thing.

1905
01:59:07.910 --> 01:59:11.920
It's just weird that that's your,
that's your lane for where did he learn that?

1906
01:59:11.950 --> 01:59:16.050
What did he see that in a movie or it was like an old black and white a talky me

1907
01:59:17.590 --> 01:59:21.460
like,
Ma,
I love you sweetheart.

1908
01:59:22.340 --> 01:59:27.220
Um,
I gotta show you something.
She doesn't know this but this,
no,
this is good.

1909
01:59:27.670 --> 01:59:32.050
Do you remember like a week or two ago?
No,
this is a good one.

1910
01:59:32.330 --> 01:59:36.610
I promise.
Week or two ago.
You know,
a lot of people have picked up on that.

1911
01:59:36.611 --> 01:59:38.260
We having fun with Garth.

1912
01:59:39.100 --> 01:59:41.940
Somebody made an Instagram post.
Yeah.

1913
01:59:42.190 --> 01:59:45.210
That was so well done.
It's great.

1914
01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:48.670
People thought that it was me doing a joke,

1915
01:59:49.090 --> 01:59:54.090
but actually she's a video effects artist and she faced swapped me with Garth.

1916
01:59:54.580 --> 01:59:57.790
No Way.
And she,
so people were like,

1917
01:59:57.791 --> 01:59:59.760
I can't believe you got the hat and you put them like,

1918
01:59:59.770 --> 02:00:04.150
what are you talking about?
She put my face on a video of him.
Brilliant.

1919
02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:07.400
But like scary where I saw it.
I was like,
Ooh.

1920
02:00:07.401 --> 02:00:10.720
Like I dropped my phone and it was Jenna Sunday and uh,

1921
02:00:10.750 --> 02:00:13.360
she's a video effects artist in Vancouver.

1922
02:00:13.420 --> 02:00:17.770
So this is the video that she made.
Just like for fun.
She put this up,

1923
02:00:17.880 --> 02:00:21.690
<v 8>okay.
The dream still lives in my dream is for us to love one another.</v>

1924
02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:26.270
All of us.
Oh God.

1925
02:00:26.430 --> 02:00:31.290
<v 0>Oh my God.
Wait a second,
man isn't ready for that.</v>

1926
02:00:31.291 --> 02:00:35.040
No,
no.
Do it again.
Do it again.
Fucking freaked me out.

1927
02:00:36.180 --> 02:00:37.890
But I like it.
Yeah.

1928
02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:39.210
<v 8>I don't like it,
but I like it.</v>

1929
02:00:39.211 --> 02:00:42.690
Dreams still this and my dream is for us to love one another.

1930
02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:49.300
<v 0>Yeah.
I mean it's
so what it would look like.</v>

1931
02:00:49.301 --> 02:00:52.150
Imagine like I opened my phone like what in the fuck?

1932
02:00:52.330 --> 02:00:54.780
Because I thought I've seen Photoshop,

1933
02:00:54.810 --> 02:00:58.630
but you see a mouth moving and you're like,
no.
And it doesn't look like,

1934
02:00:58.960 --> 02:00:59.960
you know how uh,

1935
02:01:00.190 --> 02:01:02.860
like Conan used to do those things where he'd do the face and the mouth.

1936
02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:06.940
Now it's full on the person.
So anyways,
I reached out to her.

1937
02:01:06.941 --> 02:01:10.890
I told her how big of fans we were,
you know,

1938
02:01:11.530 --> 02:01:15.550
and I said,
well,
I was like,
I go,
this is amazing.
Can you do any others?

1939
02:01:19.420 --> 02:01:22.170
<v 8>Let's get physical and music.
I like that</v>

1940
02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:26.140
stupid.
Your eyes.

1941
02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:33.770
<v 0>Oh,
like everything is dependent on,
she explained it to me a little bit.</v>

1942
02:01:34.250 --> 02:01:37.850
Everything's dependent on body position lighting and like what,

1943
02:01:37.980 --> 02:01:40.100
what is available of me lines

1944
02:01:40.150 --> 02:01:43.900
<v 4>up with completely normal cover.
So you're,
you're making an expression.
Yes.</v>

1945
02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:44.211
By the way,

1946
02:01:44.211 --> 02:01:49.190
these have got to make his way to guards inbox and this is when he goes Torrens.

1947
02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:53.300
Either it's gone too far or like,
alright,
now I respect the art form now

1948
02:01:58.650 --> 02:01:59.483
I like that.

1949
02:02:02.030 --> 02:02:05.930
That's got a little Nicholson to it as well.
I want to post cool stuff,

1950
02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:07.820
slick stuff,
meat stuff,

1951
02:02:09.050 --> 02:02:11.450
but most of the stuff I'm going to post is going to be raw stuff like this.

1952
02:02:13.070 --> 02:02:16.820
It's so raw on the age in my element.
Is this like a,

1953
02:02:17.990 --> 02:02:18.771
on my Instagram,

1954
02:02:18.771 --> 02:02:22.700
if you follow this is when he announced that he was joining Facebook.

1955
02:02:23.390 --> 02:02:26.180
He made the weirdest post of all.
You don't know about that.

1956
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:31.430
That's what started it.
Will Smith Join Instagram?

1957
02:02:31.431 --> 02:02:32.630
Like that was a big deal too,

1958
02:02:32.690 --> 02:02:36.020
but obviously he did it in a very cool big Willie style way.
You know?

1959
02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:38.630
He wasn't like,
this is going to be where you get the raw Willie's stuff.

1960
02:02:38.631 --> 02:02:42.740
You know?
This is nothing cool about guard social media and that's the problem.

1961
02:02:42.770 --> 02:02:45.780
Is there anything wrong?
He's like,

1962
02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:48.620
you're going to get raw stuff like me telling you about how rod's going to get,

1963
02:02:48.860 --> 02:02:52.760
there's no rod's going to get just me talking about the rawness that Garth is

1964
02:02:52.761 --> 02:02:56.630
going to deliver.
You gotta see this.
This is the actual video.
This is the real,

1965
02:02:56.960 --> 02:02:57.770
okay,

1966
02:02:57.770 --> 02:03:02.770
so this is just imagine you just joined Facebook like Facebook a year and a half

1967
02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:08.030
ago or something and decide to pose of this for joining Facebook.

1968
02:03:08.770 --> 02:03:11.420
Well,
I guess it's official.
We're now on Facebook.

1969
02:03:11.930 --> 02:03:13.760
I really wasn't sure about this at the start,

1970
02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:17.210
but then a friend of mine said something that just made all kinds of sense.

1971
02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:21.670
She said,
think of it more as a conversation.
I like that,

1972
02:03:22.590 --> 02:03:24.140
but I'm already finding out on my own,

1973
02:03:24.380 --> 02:03:28.190
so it's wiping the walls out between you and me and I really liked that.

1974
02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:33.830
It allows us into each other's worlds where I can,
I guess in my case,
hotel room.

1975
02:03:34.180 --> 02:03:36.920
What if he was watching tip toes?
I think I want to post,

1976
02:03:37.130 --> 02:03:40.250
I want to post cool stuff,
slick stuff,
neat stuff.

1977
02:03:41.540 --> 02:03:43.370
But most of the stuff I'm going to post is going to be raw steel.

1978
02:03:43.371 --> 02:03:46.200
You gotta pick one man,
cause that's a whole different genres looking raw.

1979
02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:49.400
This is to keep doing that sexy voice

1980
02:03:51.430 --> 02:03:55.880
slicks down.
Hey Man.
So this is truly a conversation.
There we go.

1981
02:03:56.130 --> 02:04:00.700
Did I say let the conversation begin?
If the editor with a,

1982
02:04:01.190 --> 02:04:02.930
then I'd be like,
all right,
I'm on board.

1983
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:09.200
Slick stuff like come on back for more raw Garth.
I really like that.

1984
02:04:11.090 --> 02:04:11.923
This is,

1985
02:04:12.290 --> 02:04:16.590
is this getting as much attention from the world as you guys are giving it on

1986
02:04:16.591 --> 02:04:21.210
the side stuff?
Garth is a hindrance to social media.
Oh yeah,
we,

1987
02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:22.940
well I don't know if he's getting,
we're,

1988
02:04:22.970 --> 02:04:27.040
you're doing a lot of the legwork and his,
his educating America or you know,

1989
02:04:27.060 --> 02:04:31.810
he's the actual meet his Instagram is over.
It is over.
Is destroyed.

1990
02:04:32.950 --> 02:04:37.620
It's destroyed.
Yeah.
We've infiltrated

1991
02:04:38.740 --> 02:04:39.100
<v 7>do,</v>

1992
02:04:39.100 --> 02:04:42.600
there's going to be meet and greets where people are like coming up to him like,

1993
02:04:42.690 --> 02:04:46.790
oh you're writing for telling them some of these soundbites.

1994
02:04:47.390 --> 02:04:50.250
Do the meet and greets are mommies are probably gonna be like,
Hey Hitler,

1995
02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:53.430
where am up for stroke gang high and tight.
He's like,

1996
02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:57.810
why is everyone telling me they want to jerk off of me the way that something

1997
02:04:57.811 --> 02:05:00.750
that's been going?
Oh yeah.
They're like,
we'll come in for stroke.

1998
02:05:01.460 --> 02:05:06.060
All these comments are inside jokes from us and they're usually vile,
but like,

1999
02:05:06.380 --> 02:05:10.220
like weirdly veiled or like they don't add up.
If you don't know what it,

2000
02:05:10.230 --> 02:05:14.430
that's why everyone's like,
what's going on here?
This is when he,

2001
02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:19.200
you're going to get them.
By the way,
I just feel like Garth,
come on.
Come on man.

2002
02:05:19.260 --> 02:05:22.560
Come on.
I got to know about,
okay.
Weird with us.
How about this?

2003
02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:24.390
I challenged it to the mommies.

2004
02:05:24.780 --> 02:05:27.960
I know you can do this because you guys have risen to every challenge we've ever

2005
02:05:27.961 --> 02:05:31.200
posed.
Yeah.
If somebody here can meet Garth Brooks,

2006
02:05:31.230 --> 02:05:34.230
get a video of you meeting him at a meet and greet or something.
There you go.

2007
02:05:34.290 --> 02:05:39.110
And throw out some moms,
your moms house phrases.
That will be the ultimate.
Yeah,

2008
02:05:39.150 --> 02:05:43.800
that'd be great.
We've got him to do them.
Oh my God,
that's actually,

2009
02:05:43.801 --> 02:05:47.190
cause sometimes they're just so unaware and famous where they're like,
hey,

2010
02:05:47.191 --> 02:05:51.300
say happy birthday to my aunt Judy and then say,
uh,
you know,
and then he was big.

2011
02:05:51.330 --> 02:05:54.870
Oh Shit.
And they'll just keep your jeans high and tight.
Jeans up.

2012
02:05:54.930 --> 02:05:58.020
Todd and Christine then game over.
Yeah,
it is.
It is game.

2013
02:05:58.021 --> 02:06:02.820
But we'll move on after that.
Oh,
that would be,
but look,
I didn't want to be,

2014
02:06:03.180 --> 02:06:05.880
I didn't want it.
These videos to just be me.
Oh sure.

2015
02:06:05.881 --> 02:06:09.840
I also asked if she could do one or two of you.
Oh,

2016
02:06:09.841 --> 02:06:12.290
it's Tricia and my Trisha Yearwood.

2017
02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:15.690
You want to see her work day?
Let's see,

2018
02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:21.270
Jenna Sundays VFX work for Christina.
Okay,
let's see.
Wait [inaudible] Sunday

2019
02:06:21.410 --> 02:06:25.810
<v 6>especially.
Oh,
oh my God.</v>

2020
02:06:25.890 --> 02:06:28.670
That's supportive.
Thank Yo.
Gabba

2021
02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:34.740
hey sweetie.
That's Kim.
And I know,
I know.
I remember

2022
02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:37.073
in my,

2023
02:06:37.660 --> 02:06:42.660
I saw two gentlemen is home with extremely large,

2024
02:06:43.510 --> 02:06:44.343
especially

2025
02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:49.310
that's supportive venture.

2026
02:06:52.570 --> 02:06:57.100
Horrendous at another way.
If you want to see what horrible person.
Oh,

2027
02:06:57.101 --> 02:06:59.830
she topped it.
You want to see it?
I don't know.
Here we go.

2028
02:07:01.050 --> 02:07:04.490
Here you go with your hit song.
Stay United Day,
United States,

2029
02:07:04.491 --> 02:07:06.310
and they use day in those days a lot.

2030
02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:10.953
Even

2031
02:07:15.330 --> 02:07:17.820
my face looks a lot smoother than that.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

2032
02:07:17.990 --> 02:07:22.660
<v 7>Wow.
Can I have this to put on my social media?
Yes,
you can.</v>

2033
02:07:22.700 --> 02:07:26.140
On the Christina p Instagram,
just so you know.

2034
02:07:26.330 --> 02:07:30.830
<v 6>Oh my God.
I had a feeling that was my next guest.
If you were like,</v>

2035
02:07:30.900 --> 02:07:32.570
I'm going to face you think comes with that sound.

2036
02:07:35.780 --> 02:07:36.000
That

2037
02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:40.480
<v 7>would have been,
oh my God.
I wonder if you remember the golden voice guy.</v>

2038
02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:43.120
I bet you don't remember that guy that got discovered on the side of the road

2039
02:07:43.121 --> 02:07:48.121
and he was 95.5 and then you got like a Kraft singles commercial in that Kraft

2040
02:07:49.061 --> 02:07:52.460
macaroni and cheese and he's like,
Yep,
rubber cheese sauce and your taint.

2041
02:07:52.480 --> 02:07:55.730
And they were like,
dude,
I think we got to mix it up.
You're good.

2042
02:07:55.750 --> 02:07:59.680
We're good on that take.
His voice was not,
he was unbelievable though.
Yeah,

2043
02:07:59.810 --> 02:08:03.550
but then Denise smoke a bunch of crack.
Yeah,
well he blew all his money.

2044
02:08:03.551 --> 02:08:05.500
They gave him like 40 grand.

2045
02:08:05.501 --> 02:08:08.020
And you can't give someone who's been living on the street.
No,
no.

2046
02:08:08.060 --> 02:08:11.290
Just a windfall.
You'll get it together.
Right.
All right,
so here we go.

2047
02:08:11.291 --> 02:08:14.580
Like it doesn't work.
Like give them like $10 a day.
Yeah,

2048
02:08:15.090 --> 02:08:18.520
don't spend it all in one a program.
Couple more.
You want to see a couple more?

2049
02:08:18.710 --> 02:08:20.380
Oh those are,
by the way,

2050
02:08:20.381 --> 02:08:22.450
that's my new favorite thing that I've seen on the Internet.

2051
02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:27.070
Cause that quality does matter.
It does because that really,

2052
02:08:27.850 --> 02:08:29.770
you know,
you can't terrifying.

2053
02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:34.780
Like with that first one especially be like at that level she threw that

2054
02:08:34.781 --> 02:08:37.840
together casually.
You know it didn't spend like weeks doing it.
Yeah.

2055
02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:42.920
Like what is capable?
What is possible with all face swapping?

2056
02:08:43.460 --> 02:08:46.000
Oh two where like maybe they're doing it toward them.
People post videos.

2057
02:08:46.170 --> 02:08:48.650
I mean with this Kevin Hart Shit that's going on.

2058
02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:50.980
What if somebody posted some video with his face being like,

2059
02:08:51.190 --> 02:08:53.950
and we got the tweets.
We also have old footage of him saying stuff,

2060
02:08:55.070 --> 02:08:59.020
but I mean the Jews
through juicing,

2061
02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:04.250
we were thought we were just talking about gays and especially the Jews.

2062
02:09:05.860 --> 02:09:10.500
I don't know.
Maybe make Burke Chrysler the racist.
You Ready?

2063
02:09:10.540 --> 02:09:11.690
Ready for this one gene?
Okay,

2067
02:09:25.610 --> 02:09:28.770
I hate that so much.

2068
02:09:30.310 --> 02:09:34.640

It's really good.

2075
02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:05.900
Full God.
Why would you capture that?
Why'd you do that?

2076
02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:10.110
I was a good idea at the time and time.

2077
02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:14.610
Everyone was asking me.
Everybody wanted me to do it.
Show us what it looks like.

2078
02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:18.960
She did such an amazing job.

But I'll just have to,
that's going to take hours to do that.

2094

Fuck man.
You,
you or Elise and Achilles.

2101
02:11:48.860 --> 02:11:52.660
I mean I'm seeing my face on it as calling in to see me when I come up with

2102
02:11:52.661 --> 02:11:53.980
today and try it out.
Try it out.

2103
02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:57.590
Does that Tribbey does it feel like an old sketch you did?
You're like,

2104
02:11:57.670 --> 02:12:00.260
forget like Debbie,
we can do a video back in the day that be surfaced.

2105
02:12:00.310 --> 02:12:01.620
I married students and stuff in college.

2106
02:12:01.621 --> 02:12:06.580
It was just me before stand up like my bills and tried out and I fucking pissed

2107
02:12:06.581 --> 02:12:07.050
on me.

2108
02:12:07.050 --> 02:12:09.250
<v 0>I have to say,
yeah,
this is amazing.</v>

2109
02:12:09.251 --> 02:12:14.251
This one is especially creepy because your face shape and your dark under eye

2110
02:12:15.011 --> 02:12:19.480
circles kind of mad themselves to him.
Yeah,
like yeah.

2111
02:12:20.110 --> 02:12:22.540
I didn't realize the similarity between you and to try it out.

2112
02:12:22.541 --> 02:12:26.480
Thank you very much.
There are a lot of similarities.

2113
02:12:27.010 --> 02:12:31.360
Similarities.
Uh,
I will post,
I mean this whole highlight,

2114
02:12:31.361 --> 02:12:32.560
we'll be on our youtube channel,

2115
02:12:32.561 --> 02:12:36.450
but I'll post a couple of those on my Instagram page.
Watch.

2116
02:12:36.860 --> 02:12:40.930
Holy Shit.
God.
Somebody had to ask for advice.

2117
02:12:40.931 --> 02:12:44.650
Maybe Adam can jump in on it.
Says Hi Tim and Christine.

2118
02:12:45.340 --> 02:12:46.870
I am a new college student.

2119
02:12:46.871 --> 02:12:51.490
I'm having a hard time adjusting to a bathroom situation.
Mainly the toilet,

2120
02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:55.480
the toilet paper department as a hairy boy,
I required okay man.

2121
02:12:55.510 --> 02:13:00.430
Plenty of wiping once he's up on the personal nickname.
I know Harry boy,

2122
02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:05.110
I'm a hairball being finished using the toilet and this is something I was okay

2123
02:13:05.111 --> 02:13:09.040
with,
uh,
until getting to college at home.
I have a nice soft toilet paper,

2124
02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:11.590
don't have any problems getting it all cleaned up back there.

2125
02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:16.430
But now there seems to be some problems.
My butthole is not only chafed active,

2126
02:13:16.450 --> 02:13:17.590
the amount of times I need to wipe,

2127
02:13:17.591 --> 02:13:21.620
but also I need to white even more with the lower quality paper.
Oh.
And like warm

2128
02:13:23.330 --> 02:13:25.840
like dorms or the where they really just,
they go to Kinko's and they're like,

2129
02:13:25.841 --> 02:13:27.310
do you guys got any leftover sheets?

2130
02:13:27.550 --> 02:13:31.250
What kind of deal can we get on 100,000 rolls of paper?
That's what they him,

2131
02:13:31.251 --> 02:13:32.084
they were like,
this shit's

2132
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:35.210
<v 7>fucking a dime.
We get this.
I just thought it was our dorms.</v>

2133
02:13:35.230 --> 02:13:38.460
Good to know that it's universal.
That dorm 12 paper was inferior.

2134
02:13:38.670 --> 02:13:41.570
I'm not going to let your boat with his toilet paper.
Yeah,
so that's,

2135
02:13:42.030 --> 02:13:45.090
so he used the word,
so he says,
how do you believe I should bring about a change?

2136
02:13:45.091 --> 02:13:48.420
I don't want college tuition rates to go up because of the change and toilet

2137
02:13:48.421 --> 02:13:52.380
paper quality,
but I can't keep living this way.
No.
Also another thought,

2138
02:13:52.381 --> 02:13:54.480
maybe it communal,
but day could be an order.

2139
02:13:55.230 --> 02:13:58.980
There's a lot to ask from your soul is,
so he's in college,
he's in college.

2140
02:13:59.350 --> 02:14:02.860
I mean,
you know,
but the day,
I mean,
come on.
Nobody offers that happen.

2141
02:14:03.030 --> 02:14:05.610
You can do that.
I mean,
here's the thing though.
These,
these kids,
man,

2142
02:14:05.820 --> 02:14:09.100
they get together and are changing the world.
You get a Facebook,

2143
02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:13.890
getting them marching on campus,
like clean our ad is good.
Like,
you know,

2144
02:14:14.100 --> 02:14:18.130
like all the Harry boys got together and together we'll stay together.
You Go,

2145
02:14:18.210 --> 02:14:21.620
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And you've got to find a bunch of Harry voice.

2146
02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:26.220
Bunch of bunch of Harry Boyd Crusading for Harry boy writes.
There you go.

2147
02:14:26.250 --> 02:14:31.250
But boy is spelled boy Harry [inaudible] Harry styles to help lead the charge

2148
02:14:31.621 --> 02:14:33.560
the most.
Like I'm the hairiest of the Harry Boys.

2149
02:14:33.810 --> 02:14:38.590
The more he could fucking exaggerate how marginalized your group.
That's right.

2150
02:14:38.650 --> 02:14:41.130
That's right.
More hysteria you can create.
I mean,

2151
02:14:41.131 --> 02:14:43.260
the president of your school will soon be like,
ah,
we,

2152
02:14:43.270 --> 02:14:47.400
I realized how wrong we've been for so long.
Ignoring the Harry Boys.

2153
02:14:47.401 --> 02:14:50.330
You stir the pot enough.
Yeah.
Someone's going to have to take a sip.
Yeah,

2154
02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:52.870
absolutely.
Fucking cool.
Said that

2155
02:14:54.510 --> 02:14:57.240
the only other options are shaved your ass.
Wax Your ass.

2156
02:14:57.710 --> 02:15:00.900
A flushable toilet wipes.
But maybe that's expensive for a college.
A lot.

2157
02:15:01.050 --> 02:15:03.780
You can afford those.
Yeah.
So or maybe he can,

2158
02:15:03.781 --> 02:15:07.860
maybe he's one of those rich college kids.
It's like,
no,
he's not gonna.

2159
02:15:07.861 --> 02:15:09.780
He's not going to get a fucking today.
It's not going to happen.

2160
02:15:09.781 --> 02:15:13.860
He's got a hairy asshole.
Right.
You have to invest in wipes.
At this point,

2161
02:15:14.230 --> 02:15:17.640
there are more discreet to carry into the bathroom than a role of your own

2162
02:15:17.641 --> 02:15:18.121
toilet paper,

2163
02:15:18.121 --> 02:15:22.180
which is another suggestion I would say by a high quality and just PR girl to

2164
02:15:22.181 --> 02:15:26.190
see you.
Why the Weird Guy Walking into the bathroom?
TP It's gross.
It's weird.

2165
02:15:26.850 --> 02:15:29.890
She's like,
oh,
is it Byo tp?
And he goes,
Eh,

2166
02:15:31.530 --> 02:15:32.610
oh I guess it is.

2167
02:15:32.620 --> 02:15:36.920
It's like I don't want you to be scared or you can chip in with some guidelines

2168
02:15:37.010 --> 02:15:41.730
on your floor and you guys can chime in together.
Get to make it a dude's thing.

2169
02:15:42.100 --> 02:15:44.640
They got a dude's nine out of school,
get the better tp tonight.

2170
02:15:44.850 --> 02:15:47.900
And you guys just have like a stack of roles and the toilet and then you,

2171
02:15:47.980 --> 02:15:50.400
you share it.
But then,
yeah.
And then that's gonna you know,

2172
02:15:50.430 --> 02:15:52.530
maybe there's like a 10 bucks a month type thing.
Yeah.

2173
02:15:53.170 --> 02:15:56.770
But that is an issue though.
College does.
That's the one thing that um,

2174
02:15:57.480 --> 02:16:00.550
I think they do slack on,
you know,
I mean you pay so much money.

2175
02:16:00.730 --> 02:16:04.080
I'm trying to go back to like,
you know,
my wiping days in college and it's,
Oh,

2176
02:16:04.170 --> 02:16:05.790
I'm having a tough time remembering fully,

2177
02:16:05.791 --> 02:16:07.920
but I know it wasn't like great and over.
No,
no,

2178
02:16:07.921 --> 02:16:11.710
it never was walking out being like what was the best part about college?
Oh Man.

2179
02:16:11.711 --> 02:16:14.730
The acting school was pretty cool,
but I got the cleanest fucking bottle,

2180
02:16:14.731 --> 02:16:17.220
you know,
like I have another suggestion for him actually.

2181
02:16:17.550 --> 02:16:20.970
I don't know where your showers are in proximity to your toilet.

2182
02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.880
That's a great question.
I used to earn our dorms.

2183
02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:27.630
The showers were right there so you could shit and then go straight to shower.

2184
02:16:27.660 --> 02:16:32.170
It's a little gross in a communal.
I know,
but what are your options?
You know,

2185
02:16:32.850 --> 02:16:34.960
you got to keep your be hopefully if you want to get laid,

2186
02:16:34.961 --> 02:16:38.080
and I know that's a priority for college guys out there and girls,

2187
02:16:38.190 --> 02:16:42.700
you really get laid.
You really do.
It's a time about this question.
It says,

2188
02:16:42.701 --> 02:16:45.490
good morning Julia,
in order in an older episode,

2189
02:16:45.491 --> 02:16:49.270
Tom Trick Christina into getting on all fours so that he could milk her.

2190
02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:53.680
Tom then requested that listeners try it out.
Report back about the reaction.

2191
02:16:53.710 --> 02:16:55.450
See years ago,
that was years ago,

2192
02:16:55.451 --> 02:16:58.640
yesterday I got my wife down in her hands and knees as had reached for her Tichy

2193
02:16:58.641 --> 02:17:00.700
yield.
Are you going to fucking milk me?

2194
02:17:00.970 --> 02:17:04.870
That's the last straw today she served as a board divorce papers and I honestly

2195
02:17:04.871 --> 02:17:09.690
cannot.
I have to go to work now.
Mwah.
Ciao baby.
Love Joe.

2196
02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:13.720
Point guys,
the Milkman.
I remember that.
I remember that

2197
02:17:15.410 --> 02:17:18.850
shit like you would get on your four is I want to show you something and then

2198
02:17:18.851 --> 02:17:22.030
you started.
He started to milk my tits and I was like,
Hey God.

2199
02:17:22.031 --> 02:17:25.530
Was it like a weird fetish or what kind of drive me finding,
yeah,

2200
02:17:25.620 --> 02:17:27.760
it'd be a clown.
I shirtless at the time,

2201
02:17:33.170 --> 02:17:34.260
my rabbits,
my mom.

2202
02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:42.550
Uh,
how about this one gene for you?

2203
02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:46.960
It says,
Hey,
Hitler's my triple d slut.
Wife always has positive

2204
02:17:49.180 --> 02:17:50.013
comments.

2205
02:17:52.990 --> 02:17:56.810
Email opening one up guys.
So anyway,
my big ass teddy was

2206
02:17:59.470 --> 02:18:02.150
very familiar.
It's still amazing.

2207
02:18:02.950 --> 02:18:04.710
They want to know about your lipstick twice.

2208
02:18:04.711 --> 02:18:09.340
If she wants to know what branch is pacifically the red ones so that she can try

2209
02:18:09.341 --> 02:18:13.000
it out.
Bradley.
Okay.
I'm going to tell you guys once and for all,

2210
02:18:13.001 --> 02:18:14.590
because I get many inquiries.

2211
02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:17.020
I lot of you've been asking about the scarf I'm wearing.

2212
02:18:17.021 --> 02:18:20.980
A lot of people are asking.
Yes.
Wait,
Tom and I'm,

2213
02:18:21.020 --> 02:18:24.040
do you ever have people on ever seen him on Instagram?
They were like,

2214
02:18:24.270 --> 02:18:26.900
a lot of people have been asking about this shirt I wear.
It's like,

2215
02:18:27.830 --> 02:18:31.150
can you take your,
like people keep hitting me up about this hat.
You're like,

2216
02:18:31.151 --> 02:18:34.050
what to fucking nobody asked her.

2217
02:18:34.110 --> 02:18:37.880
Like I can barely fucking walk through the airport.
Okay.

2218
02:18:38.050 --> 02:18:42.130
Nobody fucking ass views.
Okay,
so I'll tell you finally once and for all.

2219
02:18:42.610 --> 02:18:46.000
Molly's going to say at once,
God,
you're girl uses,

2220
02:18:46.001 --> 02:18:47.950
I'll tell you there's a few different shades,
but the bat,

2221
02:18:47.980 --> 02:18:52.980
the brand is called Smashbox and it's made specifically for like television or

2222
02:18:53.351 --> 02:18:56.170
long way.
That's why I wear it.
It lasts forever on stage.

2223
02:18:56.350 --> 02:19:00.650
The color I generally wear.
It's called infra red,
but not breaking something.

2224
02:19:00.651 --> 02:19:04.120
I'm sorry.
It's called infra I.
N f R.
A,
R e,
d.

2225
02:19:04.270 --> 02:19:06.580
And it'll stay on for fucking hours and hours,

2226
02:19:06.581 --> 02:19:11.190
but infrared yet it's a matte Smashbox.
There you go.
This,
uh,
this,

2227
02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:14.290
this email was making me laugh.
So another email came in.

2228
02:19:16.540 --> 02:19:20.070
It says,
my question is for the water champ herself.
Miss Christina.
Thank you.

2229
02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:24.040
I'm finally getting a lot of acknowledgement as a fellow lady of Hungarian

2230
02:19:24.041 --> 02:19:26.200
descent or proud bow hunt,
if you will.

2231
02:19:26.830 --> 02:19:29.930
I have found that I am an avid consumer of water.
In fact,

2232
02:19:29.931 --> 02:19:33.500
I would say that my bow hunt mother and I drink more water than anyone else.

2233
02:19:33.501 --> 02:19:38.501
I know my boyfriend never drinks water and I often find myself disgusted by the

2234
02:19:38.961 --> 02:19:40.340
color and smell of his urine.

2235
02:19:40.770 --> 02:19:44.480
They can't understand how anyone can drink anything other than water when they

2236
02:19:44.481 --> 02:19:45.500
are truly parched.

2237
02:19:45.800 --> 02:19:49.590
How do you deal with the fact that Tommy only consumes his Kako water?

2238
02:19:49.591 --> 02:19:52.880
Start with because of that.
How do you smell?

2239
02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:56.630
How do you handle the smell of his man?
Juices piss on me and beat me.

2240
02:19:56.631 --> 02:19:59.790
And keep them high and tight.
Love Ashley all,

2241
02:20:02.180 --> 02:20:05.570
yeah,
go ahead.
I'll tell you real talk that this,

2242
02:20:05.571 --> 02:20:08.420
the whole discussion about the water champ came because Tom peed in the shower

2243
02:20:08.421 --> 02:20:09.350
with me.
Oh boy.

2244
02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:13.200
And it smelled like someone had dumped a crap of coffee in the Goddamn.

2245
02:20:13.220 --> 02:20:15.960
Did you give a heads up or do you start going,
oh,
he just went into Tesco.

2246
02:20:16.200 --> 02:20:21.090
His wife to your lady.
No,

2247
02:20:21.960 --> 02:20:25.490
that's,
is that a,
do you wait till marriage for that or no?
No,
no.

2248
02:20:25.491 --> 02:20:30.400
He did get out of the way before.
So you know,
like if you're cool.
Yeah.

2249
02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:32.750
If you're a real cool then you'll be all right with this.

2250
02:20:32.780 --> 02:20:36.230
That's how I broke the fart barrier in the most bold of ways.

2251
02:20:36.770 --> 02:20:39.710
We have been dating a little bit and the Harrison Ford in the fart barrier

2252
02:20:42.750 --> 02:20:44.470
spit.
Uh,

2253
02:20:46.850 --> 02:20:51.650
that was so rad.
I was a jack.
Ryan smells like shit.
I was like,
Shit.

2254
02:20:51.890 --> 02:20:52.723
How did it get in here?

2255
02:20:55.690 --> 02:21:00.680
The Fort Barry Harris,
sorry.
A lot of great movies.

2256
02:21:01.460 --> 02:21:06.080
People sleep on the far barrier.
Air Force One,

2257
02:21:06.081 --> 02:21:06.980
all the Indiana Jones,

2258
02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:14.240
the far barrier where it's like there's a running from the terrorism terrorist

2259
02:21:16.851 --> 02:21:21.851
group and they take over the US Capitol and they have a fart Barry outside and

2260
02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:23.870
nobody wants to go in and just save them.

2261
02:21:24.040 --> 02:21:28.340
You don't remember that movie movie's wounds farting on the outside of it and

2262
02:21:30.700 --> 02:21:31.790
the most respectable act,

2263
02:21:33.170 --> 02:21:36.140
he never is frivolous ever.

2264
02:21:36.141 --> 02:21:38.870
Even at the Laker game last night and they put him on the jumbo tron,

2265
02:21:39.620 --> 02:21:43.560
Harrison Ford and the fucking thing Kevin Costner was,

2266
02:21:45.040 --> 02:21:46.620
wow.
That was me.

2267
02:21:46.680 --> 02:21:51.270
He's already entered into my mind guys.

2268
02:21:51.330 --> 02:21:55.340
Yeah,
no,
there was Lucy Lu,
Jesus.

2269
02:21:56.600 --> 02:22:00.650
I have two small children.
I have no bandwidth.
They have will Ferrell was there.

2270
02:22:00.651 --> 02:22:03.350
He got huge one.
Denzel was there.
That's a big one.

2271
02:22:03.370 --> 02:22:05.670
That should always be the biggest.
It was actually,

2272
02:22:06.010 --> 02:22:10.790
it was the biggest except that,
um,
it was the biggest for acknowledgement.
Yeah,

2273
02:22:10.850 --> 02:22:12.200
but we'll perform to meaning.

2274
02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:14.760
So we'll got even bigger as a comedian did something funny.

2275
02:22:15.470 --> 02:22:19.010
What happened was like Kevin Concert didn't even know he was on,

2276
02:22:19.011 --> 02:22:22.380
like his kid kept being like,
you're on the fucking dance.
Come on man.
Right.

2277
02:22:22.390 --> 02:22:26.520
So he was like that and before that was,
oh,
Jessica Biel got a big ovation.

2278
02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:30.300
<v 4>Very cool.
Uh,
what's the quarterback do your golf for the rams.
He got meat.</v>

2279
02:22:30.320 --> 02:22:32.790
I don't think they even knew it was,
I don't think they recognize him honestly.

2280
02:22:32.820 --> 02:22:36.740
He looks like a contestant on double dare or wild and crazy kids grew up and

2281
02:22:38.580 --> 02:22:43.470
so it's like building build is like,
oh,
people are cheering,
cheering.
Then Denzel,

2282
02:22:43.530 --> 02:22:46.740
they go fucking ape shit.
Love it.

2283
02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:50.550
But then they cut to will Ferrell after him.
Big Ovation and he goes,

2284
02:22:51.900 --> 02:22:54.780
and will's angry.
Funny.
Yes.

2285
02:22:54.860 --> 02:22:58.110
The best last leg room I went to met Jack Nicholson,

2286
02:23:00.030 --> 02:23:03.720
one of my favorite actors of all time.
He's at the game.
He leaves at one point.

2287
02:23:04.080 --> 02:23:08.640
And um,
and uh,
we were,
we were sitting,
we had access to this,

2288
02:23:08.641 --> 02:23:12.630
like there's like a side room that's like,
we can get drinks and food.

2289
02:23:12.631 --> 02:23:15.630
Like at half time of war,
we weren't on the floor,
but we were in,

2290
02:23:15.631 --> 02:23:17.790
we just had access to it somehow.
Okay.
Um,

2291
02:23:17.850 --> 02:23:21.450
my buddy add them to mine so he's got tickets to see such a big clippers game

2292
02:23:21.570 --> 02:23:26.490
fan.
He will big NBA Fan and I think Omaha we grew up,
didn't have a team.

2293
02:23:26.520 --> 02:23:29.820
I think when he got out here he was just like I'm a clippers.
Yeah,
Lakers were.

2294
02:23:29.970 --> 02:23:30.450
I can't,

2295
02:23:30.450 --> 02:23:34.380
I don't know how he got to Griffin and Chris Paul and deandre Jordan and they

2296
02:23:34.381 --> 02:23:38.010
were 14 and they were workaholics fans.
So it was like a mutual thing.

2297
02:23:38.011 --> 02:23:40.380
I think they might've hit him up and then he went to games and,

2298
02:23:40.410 --> 02:23:45.090
because I remember him being a clippers fan for a lie since he got here.
Okay.

2299
02:23:45.110 --> 02:23:48.270
Yeah.
But I mean when he got,
he woulda got here when the Lakers were smashing.

2300
02:23:48.490 --> 02:23:53.490
Yep.
I'm taking the other side,
the other side.
Um,
so we,
we go back.

2301
02:23:53.491 --> 02:23:55.390
All those guys are,
sorry,
all the clip of the,

2302
02:23:55.410 --> 02:23:57.770
I remember all the workaholics guys would go to those games.
Right.

2303
02:23:57.910 --> 02:24:00.520
Erik Griffin goes,
they got season tickets so they would go,

2304
02:24:00.810 --> 02:24:04.230
Eric is the most insane person to go to a basketball game with cause he just

2305
02:24:04.231 --> 02:24:06.720
talks so much shit.
I mean in the best and the best way.

2306
02:24:06.870 --> 02:24:11.250
And you just got that big voice roof boy and he's like,
wait all walk,
oh shade.

2307
02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:14.170
And they fucking turn around all the time and someone's,

2308
02:24:14.180 --> 02:24:16.650
they recognize them so then they laugh and other times they're just like,
man,

2309
02:24:16.651 --> 02:24:17.490
fuck you.
You know.

2310
02:24:18.340 --> 02:24:21.840
But so we go to the back area and there's this little like bar area and then you

2311
02:24:21.841 --> 02:24:25.950
go to the bathroom and you walk straight back and then there's like a two doors

2312
02:24:25.951 --> 02:24:28.530
to the bathroom and then like a little hallway in the back where you can kind of

2313
02:24:28.950 --> 02:24:33.000
almost wait or there's a chair in the back corner facing where your people are

2314
02:24:33.001 --> 02:24:34.470
standing in line to get into the bathrooms.

2315
02:24:34.710 --> 02:24:38.850
And I just walked back there and Jack's just sitting back there,
legs spread,

2316
02:24:39.150 --> 02:24:40.290
holding the coffee,

2317
02:24:40.560 --> 02:24:44.880
looks like just an old man chilling on a porch like just back.
They're just like,

2318
02:24:44.910 --> 02:24:48.300
ah,
sunglasses on,
smiling,
not talking to anybody.

2319
02:24:48.420 --> 02:24:51.510
So now there's all these dudes and girls lined up.
I mean,
it's smaller,

2320
02:24:51.511 --> 02:24:52.344
maybe four or five.

2321
02:24:52.560 --> 02:24:55.560
And everyone sees him and he's looking at us kind of looking down and you're

2322
02:24:55.561 --> 02:24:57.540
trying to like,
everyone's gauging like,
do I say something?

2323
02:24:57.630 --> 02:24:58.620
So one dude in front of,

2324
02:24:58.650 --> 02:25:01.080
and he's like looking at the girls as they go into the bathroom and you know,

2325
02:25:01.160 --> 02:25:05.070
have a good one.
He muttered something.
Yeah,
good.
Yeah.
Good luck with that.
Pissed,

2326
02:25:05.071 --> 02:25:10.050
you know?
And uh,
and uh,
and so that pice,
I mean,

2327
02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:14.230
again,
paraphrasing,
but he said some and they curse laughed like how many,

2328
02:25:14.231 --> 02:25:17.430
you know,
Jack Nicholson?
And then I remember the guy in front of me was like,

2329
02:25:17.460 --> 02:25:21.510
I got toilet paper.
He was like,

2330
02:25:21.511 --> 02:25:25.840
I'm going to throw a hail Mary and say SOM.
So he goes,
what's up Jack?

2331
02:25:26.140 --> 02:25:30.580
And he goes,
hey.
And he goes,
[inaudible] you doing man?
And he goes,

2332
02:25:31.170 --> 02:25:35.080
takes a pause,
looks down,
and then goes,
the fuck does it look like I'm doing?

2333
02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:40.420
Yeah.
And he goes,
I'm drinking a coffee in the corner and I go,
awesome.

2334
02:25:40.780 --> 02:25:45.340
And then the guy goes,
hell yeah man.
And he goes
like,

2335
02:25:45.370 --> 02:25:48.670
fucking guy.
And then he goes through and then I get up there and I'm like,

2336
02:25:48.671 --> 02:25:52.840
hey man,
I'm an actor,
you're the man.
And like,
you know,
and then he was like,
cool.

2337
02:25:52.841 --> 02:25:56.260
I go,
yeah man,
I got an act and you were my favorite.
Still are like,
you're God,

2338
02:25:56.530 --> 02:25:59.860
hope you're having a good time.
He goes,
it's a great time to live,
isn't it?

2339
02:25:59.861 --> 02:26:02.740
And I was like,
yeah man,
what are we gonna see in movies again?
He was like,

2340
02:26:02.860 --> 02:26:05.620
who knows?
And I was like,
yeah,
fair enough.
You know?

2341
02:26:05.670 --> 02:26:09.600
<v 7>Yeah.
You did a real fan thing though.
That was cool.
January and polite.
Yes.</v>

2342
02:26:09.680 --> 02:26:11.220
And also it's like a guy like,
you know,

2343
02:26:11.221 --> 02:26:14.400
we're talking about like to approach like I don't know what to say.
Oh Man.

2344
02:26:14.880 --> 02:26:17.820
There's also in such a confined area that I was like,
sometimes you know,

2345
02:26:17.821 --> 02:26:21.210
it's weirder to just stand there in silence.
Yeah.
I mean,

2346
02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:24.270
not for like urinal small talk.
I'm a big non advocate of that.

2347
02:26:24.300 --> 02:26:28.070
Like if someone talks to you.
I remember one time some guys said something,

2348
02:26:28.071 --> 02:26:32.200
he was like,
man,
I don't these urinals like two,
uh,
two small and mixed.
My,
uh,

2349
02:26:32.460 --> 02:26:34.410
are too big.
It makes me feel like my Dick's do small.

2350
02:26:34.740 --> 02:26:37.830
And like basically it would have been weird if we not to say anything.

2351
02:26:37.831 --> 02:26:40.710
So I was like,
yeah man,
you know,
I bet you're fine.
You know,
like just chime in,

2352
02:26:40.711 --> 02:26:43.440
back end.
It's like,
no,
look,
look,
look at it.

2353
02:26:43.900 --> 02:26:45.900
You think it's like don't talk at the urinal.

2354
02:26:48.900 --> 02:26:51.160
She asked how I deal with it.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2355
02:26:51.161 --> 02:26:56.100
So the point is is that you sometimes drink so little water and I'm being

2356
02:26:56.101 --> 02:26:59.490
serious.
If you look at our desk right now,
what's he drinking?
Brown soda.

2357
02:26:59.760 --> 02:27:00.593
It's not bright.

2358
02:27:01.580 --> 02:27:05.340
And sometimes when you drink a lot of coffee ground during the day,

2359
02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:07.530
I can smell it coming out of your pores.

2360
02:27:07.620 --> 02:27:11.640
I'll smell your forehead and it'll smell like calm going to get one after this.

2361
02:27:11.950 --> 02:27:16.440
But you get that mocha forehead,
by the way,

2362
02:27:16.441 --> 02:27:20.820
that's the name of the,
um,
the lead actor.

2363
02:27:20.850 --> 02:27:25.830
The young kid in fart barrier is mocha forehead.
Forehead.

2364
02:27:25.831 --> 02:27:28.420
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's trying to break out

2365
02:27:30.970 --> 02:27:33.300
cause there's always like an a move back that there's always some young kid that

2366
02:27:33.301 --> 02:27:36.540
you're like,
who's this guy?
What's his real name?
No,
that's it.

2367
02:27:36.541 --> 02:27:39.970
Apparently he's been acting since he was a fucking toddler.

2368
02:27:40.110 --> 02:27:41.430
I'll show you his cheerios commercial,

2369
02:27:41.890 --> 02:27:46.350
but you don't pee enough because you don't hydrate enough.
I'm the same way,
man.

2370
02:27:46.351 --> 02:27:49.950
I need more.
What are you just so much coffee drinking black fluid too.

2371
02:27:49.960 --> 02:27:52.890
He's drinking lack fluid.
You're drinking oil.
You're gonna,

2372
02:27:52.900 --> 02:27:55.380
you're gonna get kidney stones.
If this,

2373
02:27:55.430 --> 02:27:58.350
right now I'm trying to think of is that's going to be a painful thing.

2374
02:27:58.530 --> 02:28:01.890
I'm trying to think of what I would say to Jack Nicholson too though.

2375
02:28:02.170 --> 02:28:06.630
I feel like I know what I'd ask him what we were talking about last night.

2376
02:28:06.631 --> 02:28:08.310
When you're sitting in my house last night,
Dawg,

2377
02:28:08.311 --> 02:28:10.580
you smile because he sits court side now.

2378
02:28:10.590 --> 02:28:12.870
How does Jack Nicholson take a piss during the Laker game?

2379
02:28:13.520 --> 02:28:15.660
He'd just get swarmed by fans.

2380
02:28:15.661 --> 02:28:20.661
What do you think passed when he's sitting fucking court side with a little

2381
02:28:20.731 --> 02:28:24.350
bottle?
Just whips it out.
That's what I was saying.
One side you get like,

2382
02:28:24.380 --> 02:28:27.500
it's like the benefit of being that close.
They're like,
ah,
we love,

2383
02:28:27.510 --> 02:28:29.750
it's a lot of publicity for us if you want to put out and just go.

2384
02:28:29.751 --> 02:28:31.200
And he was like,
I was already planning on,

2385
02:28:31.820 --> 02:28:36.020
I'm planning on it and then one of the Laker girls comes over with a cup holds

2386
02:28:36.021 --> 02:28:40.190
it,
pulls his dick out.
Yeah this is into it here,
but I'll shake myself.

2387
02:28:40.230 --> 02:28:43.880
Oh No,
I like it cause that's the part where he goes,

2388
02:28:43.920 --> 02:28:45.200
don't get weird if she does it.

2389
02:28:45.340 --> 02:28:48.710
I think when it gets full and like he puts his dick away,

2390
02:28:49.070 --> 02:28:53.780
she looks at him and he goes,
you can take a sip.
And she's like,

2391
02:28:56.720 --> 02:29:01.370
no.
She goes,
it tastes good.
Yeah.
You know it does.

2392
02:29:01.820 --> 02:29:06.140
And then get out of here.
Anger Management on TBS.

2393
02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:13.360
I feel like his stories of how he closed deals with checks has got to be the

2394
02:29:14.091 --> 02:29:18.230
greatest one.
Rival old girls.
Do you think he's nailed?
Because,
great question.

2395
02:29:18.740 --> 02:29:19.910
Obviously that's happened.

2396
02:29:19.911 --> 02:29:23.180
I mean there's so many different genres of women that you could ask that

2397
02:29:23.181 --> 02:29:26.450
question about what we could be like,
how many women do you think he's nailed?

2398
02:29:26.750 --> 02:29:31.150
How many,
how many women at Laco fucking places.
I'm saying,

2399
02:29:31.190 --> 02:29:32.440
cause he's at the games every week.

2400
02:29:32.470 --> 02:29:36.210
We're talking to eighties nineties two thousands right?
Seventies right.

2401
02:29:37.430 --> 02:29:39.680
They make what,
$50 not a lot.

2402
02:29:39.681 --> 02:29:43.730
One of my buddies girls was for awhile and it sucked me into it just to give you

2403
02:29:43.731 --> 02:29:46.190
two seats and they were up in the nosebleeds and they're just like,

2404
02:29:46.191 --> 02:29:47.570
this is a privilege.
If you don't want to do it,

2405
02:29:47.571 --> 02:29:49.440
we'll find somebody and they will.
They will talk.

2406
02:29:49.600 --> 02:29:52.930
What was that story about the cowboys cheerleaders?
Something like,

2407
02:29:53.390 --> 02:29:57.200
but back to your thing,
Nicholson has smashed a lot,

2408
02:29:58.250 --> 02:30:01.300
probably more than wilt Chamberlain or they said,
you know,
it was all like,

2409
02:30:01.940 --> 02:30:03.080
let's say like over like a million.

2410
02:30:03.081 --> 02:30:07.870
He said he served like 53 a day for filming.

2411
02:30:09.770 --> 02:30:10.603
Yeah.

2412
02:30:11.120 --> 02:30:15.720
Jack Nicholson did not get famous until he was about 28 or 30 years old.

2413
02:30:16.490 --> 02:30:20.720
I would say older than that.
Okay,
so let's say what?
Mid Thirties yeah,
maybe late.

2414
02:30:20.721 --> 02:30:24.110
So easy rider.
He does when he's 28 that's the big one.

2415
02:30:24.530 --> 02:30:28.070
Now you look at somebody like Justin Bieber who's been busting nuts since he was

2416
02:30:28.071 --> 02:30:32.790
like,
that's true.
That's a really good point.
Since he wrote Bustin nuts.
Yeah.

2417
02:30:34.690 --> 02:30:39.530
Yeah.
Bieber has been started.
He started earlier.

2418
02:30:40.010 --> 02:30:41.210
So you've,
you know what I'm saying?

2419
02:30:41.211 --> 02:30:45.140
You have to take that into account when you're looking at nuts busted throughout

2420
02:30:45.150 --> 02:30:49.290
the years.
So when is Nicholson,
when does he get famous?
Can we look that up?
Yeah,

2421
02:30:49.310 --> 02:30:53.990
let's do the math.
Let's see.
It was cuckoo's nest.
Was that you're no,
I'm sorry.

2422
02:30:54.040 --> 02:30:58.770
Shining.
Shining,
shining.
Oh
yeah,

2423
02:30:59.260 --> 02:31:03.630
hold on to,
let's see.
Jack Nicholson,
who was that guy in acting class?

2424
02:31:03.650 --> 02:31:07.790
81 now he's 81 yeah,
I started late.

2425
02:31:07.820 --> 02:31:12.150
I saw 81 year old Jack Nicholson.
Yeah.
Tell someone like,
what the fuck do you,

2426
02:31:12.160 --> 02:31:15.960
does it look like I'm doing this?
He doesn't have as much old man swagger to

2427
02:31:18.500 --> 02:31:19.500
Tom.
Right.

2428
02:31:19.740 --> 02:31:24.720
If he's starting fucking at like 30 so he made like,

2429
02:31:24.750 --> 02:31:25.351
you know what I'm saying?

2430
02:31:25.351 --> 02:31:28.650
If I Agra didn't come around until when early two thousands do you think this

2431
02:31:28.651 --> 02:31:33.370
guy fucked a lot though?
Give me a break.
You're like,
hey you,

2432
02:31:33.371 --> 02:31:35.460
you'd say like Jack,
do you sleep well?
He's like,

2433
02:31:35.461 --> 02:31:36.900
well I don't have any come lifted.

2434
02:31:40.040 --> 02:31:42.930
He's all brittle.
If he said that on like a Jay Leno interview,

2435
02:31:42.931 --> 02:31:45.570
if there's a soundbite of him somewhere,
I'd be like,
how do you sleep Jag?

2436
02:31:46.260 --> 02:31:49.090
Well there's no come left critical writer.

2437
02:31:51.970 --> 02:31:54.930
So that's his last,

2438
02:31:55.650 --> 02:31:59.290
let's see if we could pull my God,
listen,
listen.
Dot.

2439
02:32:00.620 --> 02:32:01.110
Yeah,

2440
02:32:01.110 --> 02:32:05.970
that'd be the story of I want to take for how to genuinely chronicle like just

2441
02:32:05.971 --> 02:32:08.790
the,
the tails.
I mean would any,
cause no one,

2442
02:32:08.810 --> 02:32:11.180
no Hollywood elite has ever done that,
right?
Like Lee,

2443
02:32:11.370 --> 02:32:14.070
these guys that are known for being just such,
yeah.

2444
02:32:14.790 --> 02:32:19.790
Like to actually write some book where he was like chapter one Denise chapter

2445
02:32:21.570 --> 02:32:26.280
840 million do math.
Are you good at math?
I'm all right.
All right,

2446
02:32:26.281 --> 02:32:29.070
so let's,
let's figure out this age thing cause I'm,
I'm kind of curious now.

2447
02:32:29.430 --> 02:32:32.870
So math,
you do the math.
So he's born in 37 okay.

2448
02:32:33.400 --> 02:32:36.690
I'm looking at when the calculator,
I know,
well,

2449
02:32:36.691 --> 02:32:40.530
I'm just trying to look at how old he was in certain things here.
So what's,

2450
02:32:40.531 --> 02:32:43.080
what's,
what's the big one you said?
Easy rider,
like the breakout.

2451
02:32:44.270 --> 02:32:47.720
So that's 69 the big one.
So that's 32 yeah.

2452
02:32:47.850 --> 02:32:51.630
So he's 32 he's 32 for easy rider.

2453
02:32:51.631 --> 02:32:55.350
And that's like the beginning of the ascent cause he's in all this stuff before

2454
02:32:55.351 --> 02:32:56.900
that,
that that doesn't really,
yeah.

2455
02:32:57.330 --> 02:33:00.360
Then Chinatown is huge.

2456
02:33:00.450 --> 02:33:04.470
That comes out in [inaudible] 74 that was almost like his,
hey,

2457
02:33:04.890 --> 02:33:06.360
here's Jack.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2458
02:33:06.450 --> 02:33:09.550
So that fat would be like when you really start smashing hearts.
Yeah.

2459
02:33:09.750 --> 02:33:14.750
So 74 he's all,
he's uh,
he's Gunna be,
what?

2460
02:33:14.850 --> 02:33:17.160
35 37 so he's going to be 40.
He'll,

2461
02:33:17.161 --> 02:33:22.161
he's 30 I'm 37 he's 37 he's 37 yeah.

2462
02:33:23.470 --> 02:33:28.250
37 then.
Sorry.
Yeah,
but,
but also Agra back then now.

2463
02:33:28.530 --> 02:33:32.220
Yeah.
But you're 37,
he's now,
he's,
he's more mature,

2464
02:33:32.221 --> 02:33:34.950
so he really knows how to play the game or see if you learn,

2465
02:33:35.310 --> 02:33:39.300
if you're chasing getting posts in your teens and early twenties,

2466
02:33:39.301 --> 02:33:43.410
your games kind of weak because you didn't really develop like trail actually is

2467
02:33:43.411 --> 02:33:46.500
way more confident and grounded because he's almost 40.

2468
02:33:47.940 --> 02:33:52.860
Then he wins an Oscar
for maybe,
I don't know if he wanted one for that,

2469
02:33:52.861 --> 02:33:57.210
but he won one for one,
flew over the Cuckoo's nest and 75.
So he's what,

2470
02:33:57.660 --> 02:34:01.210
uh,
about to turn 38 there.

2471
02:34:01.280 --> 02:34:04.310
You're getting that high end model stuff,
you know what I'm saying?

2472
02:34:04.311 --> 02:34:09.090
Or getting like the famous actresses are getting the Mariel Hemingway fucking

2473
02:34:09.380 --> 02:34:11.890
pump and dump the extras.
I think about,

2474
02:34:13.870 --> 02:34:17.680
I think about the girls that were like,
I'm not really a Greg Kinnear girl.

2475
02:34:17.681 --> 02:34:20.410
I'm more of a,
you know,
something's got to give.

2476
02:34:20.440 --> 02:34:23.390
You've got to have daddy issues if you're begging Nicholson.
Yeah.

2477
02:34:24.100 --> 02:34:28.440
He's always been old.
So,
you know what I'm saying?
Like he's always had a very,
um,

2478
02:34:29.880 --> 02:34:34.630
you know,
just fatherly demeanor.
It was watching Christmas vacation and Doris,

2479
02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:38.620
what's her name?
The mom,
the shining in 1980 are always old.

2480
02:34:38.621 --> 02:34:42.810
Like Alan Alan Arkin.
He's always been old.
We are linked to this park.

2481
02:34:42.820 --> 02:34:47.620
Is there a young Alan Arkin picture?
Probably.
I'm going to see it or look it up.

2482
02:34:47.650 --> 02:34:50.530
I love to see your face on an Alanon video boy.

2483
02:34:52.480 --> 02:34:53.920
I mean,
how old?
Yeah,

2484
02:34:53.921 --> 02:34:56.980
he looks old as shit and he's always just been always been old.

2485
02:34:56.981 --> 02:35:00.420
I have never seen him young and a film.
Same.
A Doris Leech.

2486
02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:04.000
There's Alan.
He's cute.

2487
02:35:07.620 --> 02:35:10.630
Oldest.
Fuck Damn.
Just always all so funny.

2488
02:35:10.990 --> 02:35:13.570
So fucking Tribeca is another one of those guys,

2489
02:35:13.571 --> 02:35:18.250
but I feel like has just always looked the same.
Yup.
Yup,
Yup.

2490
02:35:18.910 --> 02:35:23.470
Let's see.
Oh yeah.
This guy right here.
Outcome.
Whoa.
No,

2491
02:35:23.471 --> 02:35:28.150
come left.
Totally drained.
You've got his eyebrows.
You've got Nichols.
Oh,

2492
02:35:28.151 --> 02:35:31.450
this guy.
Come on,
look at that smile.
Great.

2493
02:35:31.460 --> 02:35:35.920
Sprayed skin rocks and Hank.
Smash,
smash,

2494
02:35:35.950 --> 02:35:40.450
smash.
Smash.
Oh yeah,
come on.
Come on.

2495
02:35:41.150 --> 02:35:44.230
That's the stuff.
That's the prefix is pre.
Yeah.
This is when he was like,

2496
02:35:44.231 --> 02:35:47.980
who am I?
Yes.
Okay,
well let's talk about drinking a coffee.
You fuck.

2497
02:35:49.020 --> 02:35:51.880
Let's talk about 81 years old.
It was still that guy.

2498
02:35:51.881 --> 02:35:53.530
I bet he's been jack all the time.

2499
02:35:53.531 --> 02:35:56.650
You know people that know him since he was that young,
we're like,
oh yeah,

2500
02:35:56.651 --> 02:35:59.860
he's always just been course.
What about Burt Reynolds?

2501
02:36:00.160 --> 02:36:03.990
Talk about a smash machine.
Wow.
Real Hound.
Yup.
Yeah,
yeah.

2502
02:36:04.250 --> 02:36:06.430
I mean he calendar full all the time.

2503
02:36:06.820 --> 02:36:08.980
Especially especially he had a more of a window,

2504
02:36:08.981 --> 02:36:12.580
I feel like that's what I'm feeling.
Like Nicholson's post is kind of spread out.

2505
02:36:13.240 --> 02:36:18.010
But Reynolds had a 10 year window where he was the king,
the king of Showbiz.

2506
02:36:18.011 --> 02:36:21.610
That guy was banging it.
And what about a guy like Leonardo Dicaprio?

2507
02:36:21.611 --> 02:36:22.720
Whole legendary,

2508
02:36:23.020 --> 02:36:28.020
legendary guys been smashing since and he started to know what it's like to not

2509
02:36:28.121 --> 02:36:31.930
be adored.
He doesn't have memories of that too.
Exactly.

2510
02:36:31.931 --> 02:36:34.830
So he was famous like at 14 doing movies.
Yeah.

2511
02:36:34.900 --> 02:36:38.360
So imagining pain's a pussy.
He was probably just right.

2512
02:36:38.650 --> 02:36:42.130
Was that cute little kid onset?
All he's done for Cameron's like,
dude,

2513
02:36:42.131 --> 02:36:45.970
why he's fucking land.
Save yourself.
He's got to be like early forties right?

2514
02:36:46.090 --> 02:36:47.710
Right.
Yeah.
Early forties,

2515
02:36:47.830 --> 02:36:51.970
and he's just been a movie star for decades about Kirk Cameron.

2516
02:36:51.971 --> 02:36:54.820
When he was on growing pains,
was he,
was he Christian then?
Yeah.

2517
02:36:55.210 --> 02:36:59.680
He wasn't smashing.
No.
No.
He was being like a good pen.
Yep.

2518
02:36:59.950 --> 02:37:01.390
What a waste.
And it's with,
I know that,

2519
02:37:01.391 --> 02:37:05.010
but when he really came out and was just like,
God,
my kids were gay,

2520
02:37:05.011 --> 02:37:08.890
I'd fucking send them to uh,
you know,
gay camp,
a camp or something.

2521
02:37:09.730 --> 02:37:11.830
And it was just like,
oh,
you psycho.
And then he just,

2522
02:37:11.860 --> 02:37:13.090
and then they would go back and be like,

2523
02:37:13.091 --> 02:37:15.890
in a pair of the Kirk Cameron always this way.

2524
02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:20.810
<v 4>Wow.
Just same guy did the vo for tiptoes and like the gays.
Yeah.
And he was like,</v>

2525
02:37:20.811 --> 02:37:22.150
until they'd be like,
and the,
I think,

2526
02:37:22.370 --> 02:37:24.710
I don't know if they interviewed other actors or something.
They were like,
yeah,

2527
02:37:24.711 --> 02:37:26.930
man,
he was like the hottest shit ever.

2528
02:37:26.931 --> 02:37:29.540
But he just like the girls would come to his dressing room,
whatever,

2529
02:37:29.541 --> 02:37:32.960
and he'd just be like ghetto.
Like he was just very much like maybe he's on,

2530
02:37:33.030 --> 02:37:35.460
that's not what this is for.
And just,
you know,
he's,

2531
02:37:35.540 --> 02:37:39.230
he might be at him and Leo must have butted heads for sure.
Wait.
Oh,

2532
02:37:39.310 --> 02:37:42.890
must've been gay inside.
Sure.
You know what I mean?
When you fight it that hard.

2533
02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:46.900
I mean,
that's so nice.
You think so when you're like,
I hate the get.
Yeah.

2534
02:37:46.910 --> 02:37:48.600
I would send my kid to gay,
can barely,

2535
02:37:50.190 --> 02:37:54.650
you know that he knows something else is going on.
And he goes,
yeah,
yeah,
exactly.

2536
02:37:54.840 --> 02:37:59.120
Look at a guy.
All this blood goes down.
So it's like,
Leo,
get Outta here man.

2537
02:37:59.121 --> 02:38:03.790
Stop telling me about all these women.
I'm going to fuck you.
No,
I'm just,

2538
02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:08.510
I mean,
just let's run lines.
Um,
we have to ask you a question.
Yeah.

2539
02:38:08.630 --> 02:38:11.010
Okay.
We've seen a,

2540
02:38:11.180 --> 02:38:14.450
seems to think that I find certain things funny that she doesn't find fun.

2541
02:38:14.480 --> 02:38:17.510
I got to go pee.
Now's a great,
oh no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
You gotta be here for this.
Yeah.

2542
02:38:17.950 --> 02:38:20.000
So the segments called horrible are hilarious.

2543
02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:23.120
You just watch it and you just react.
Great.
We just see what happens.

2544
02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:25.340
I love that guy.
I love this is this funny

2545
02:38:25.830 --> 02:38:28.860
<v 6>fucking fuck.
Ah,</v>

2546
02:38:29.910 --> 02:38:31.320
we come at you like that.

2547
02:38:37.620 --> 02:38:42.090
<v 4>Okay.
Horrible.
Hilarious.
It's a great intro.
An intro.
Yeah.</v>

2548
02:38:42.390 --> 02:38:45.570
So here's the clip you've got to watch too.
I know.
I don't want to,

2549
02:38:45.571 --> 02:38:49.050
but I wouldn't.
Yeah.
Here we go.
Oh,
it's going to be a oh shit.

2550
02:38:57.550 --> 02:38:57.800
<v 6>Okay.</v>

2551
02:38:57.800 --> 02:38:59.720
<v 4>Yes.
Yup.</v>

2552
02:39:00.410 --> 02:39:03.740
This is the difference between guys and girls when they say there's no

2553
02:39:03.741 --> 02:39:06.310
difference in the genders.
This is definitely man,
come on.

2554
02:39:06.350 --> 02:39:08.180
There's a lot of genders.
Which genders are you talking about?

2555
02:39:08.420 --> 02:39:11.880
A buck naked window.
Fault.
Come on,
but he's dead.
No,
he's,

2556
02:39:12.190 --> 02:39:13.023
<v 6>hello?</v>

2557
02:39:14.800 --> 02:39:16.840
<v 4>Yeah.
No,
the way he hit look,</v>

2558
02:39:16.841 --> 02:39:19.560
he's probably gonna get some sort of reconstructive surgery,
but yeah,

2559
02:39:19.570 --> 02:39:22.810
he's brought that garbage can.
Yeah,
he's bruised.
That's the thing about dudes.

2560
02:39:22.811 --> 02:39:24.410
There's resilient.
Like he's probably fallen out of a,

2561
02:39:24.440 --> 02:39:28.390
of a tree as a kid like that.
Pictures my son,

2562
02:39:28.391 --> 02:39:31.390
like your son is not doing this,
but he might one day.

2563
02:39:31.510 --> 02:39:34.300
What was that guy escaping from Hawaii?
I don't know.

2564
02:39:34.330 --> 02:39:38.180
But something in the day with a lot of clothes.
Yeah.
Cause he was a,

2565
02:39:38.830 --> 02:39:40.000
he was really trying to get out of there.

2566
02:39:40.001 --> 02:39:42.580
And you imagine me in that situation where like if the guy,
like I,

2567
02:39:42.600 --> 02:39:47.200
I immediately pictured like he was with some girl and the guy came back and he's

2568
02:39:47.201 --> 02:39:50.320
like,
I just got to get out now and you don't even have time to think.

2569
02:39:50.321 --> 02:39:53.120
And there's only one way out.
That's the guys there.
That's what you said.

2570
02:39:53.230 --> 02:39:56.410
Exactly what happened.
So he got outside and the guy was like,

2571
02:39:56.440 --> 02:39:59.590
you really going to jump out a window,
you know,
I'm just,
I don't know.

2572
02:39:59.650 --> 02:40:02.530
It seemed like it was a card.
It seemed like it wasn't in the back of that,

2573
02:40:02.580 --> 02:40:03.550
but it didn't seem local.

2574
02:40:03.551 --> 02:40:06.790
They didn't recognize it and recognize the font of the trash.
That's true.

2575
02:40:07.030 --> 02:40:09.370
What did you think was happening?
That's the only storyline.
Oh,

2576
02:40:09.371 --> 02:40:10.690
I thought it was a Mike.

2577
02:40:10.691 --> 02:40:14.100
My immediate thought was this is a mentally ill man hanging out outside

2578
02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:17.280
<v 7>of his window.
He's having an affair and the,
and the other guy,</v>

2579
02:40:17.281 --> 02:40:19.620
I'm telling you what I thought we'd have to find out more information.

2580
02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:20.950
Do you think he was like,

2581
02:40:20.970 --> 02:40:23.550
I'm going to go change the thermostat and the next thing you know he's outside

2582
02:40:23.551 --> 02:40:27.990
of his roommates are like,
he does this a lot.
He's a little off.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2583
02:40:28.110 --> 02:40:31.440
It's attached to that is do we see some,
but here's the thing though,

2584
02:40:31.470 --> 02:40:36.090
is somebody in the,
in the building the room that he was in?

2585
02:40:36.150 --> 02:40:40.950
Yeah.
No.
See what I mean?
Like they would have been there like pointing,

2586
02:40:40.951 --> 02:40:43.380
grabbing.
It's like he's alone.
Well,

2587
02:40:43.381 --> 02:40:46.350
maybe the wife is dealing with her husband right now.
Does your sleep walk?

2588
02:40:46.351 --> 02:40:47.850
A husband probably wants to murder this guy.

2589
02:40:49.320 --> 02:40:52.750
He's not really trying to pull him to,
did he let go?
No.
Oh,
he's probably stuck.

2590
02:40:55.140 --> 02:40:59.470
God,
I love the one person there that just had no clue.
So one was hanging.
I know,

2591
02:40:59.490 --> 02:41:04.290
right?
Yeah,
you're right.
If she turned over here,
fuck over here.
Someone dammit.

2592
02:41:04.291 --> 02:41:08.160
Darin.
This buildings full of naked dudes hanging outside the,
well,
yeah.

2593
02:41:08.161 --> 02:41:11.160
This person doesn't real.
You're right.
Yeah.
Say she turns around a long leash.

2594
02:41:11.190 --> 02:41:15.490
Imagine just walking
that,

2595
02:41:16.290 --> 02:41:19.290
the shop carrying your laundry.
How about Mr?
I don't even flinch.

2596
02:41:19.370 --> 02:41:22.560
This guy was just like,
he was waiting for it.
Maybe that's the guy.

2597
02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:24.090
Maybe that's the guy that was in the room.

2598
02:41:24.091 --> 02:41:26.850
Now I can think he's outside the window and he goes,
he goes,
go ahead.

2599
02:41:26.851 --> 02:41:31.110
Hang out there.
I'll meet you downstairs.
Yeah.
Yeah,
cause he doesn't even flinch.

2600
02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:36.360
Doesn't even flinch.
He bounced off at trash cans.
So nut.
That's a lucky fall too.

2601
02:41:36.570 --> 02:41:40.140
Cause he is fine.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's all right.
If you miss those trash cans,

2602
02:41:40.141 --> 02:41:44.430
that's it.
That's a wrap on the day.
So what's the vote?
Horrible are hilarious.

2603
02:41:44.431 --> 02:41:48.140
Hilarious.
Yeah.
Christina,
you guys are sociopaths,
both of you and you have no,

2604
02:41:50.010 --> 02:41:54.230
no,
no,
no.
I think that's the hard,
that's what you mean to say?
No,
no,

2605
02:41:54.840 --> 02:41:57.780
it's holidays.
I find that rude of you to say.

2606
02:41:57.800 --> 02:41:59.640
How do you find physical stuff like that?

2607
02:41:59.641 --> 02:42:02.280
Funny at all is because he wasn't clothed.
No.

2608
02:42:02.340 --> 02:42:06.630
I as a mother and you don't think of your son's doing crazy shit as a person of

2609
02:42:06.631 --> 02:42:08.310
earth,
a sweet person,
a person,

2610
02:42:08.350 --> 02:42:11.940
a person with sympathy and I can put myself in other people's shoes.

2611
02:42:11.960 --> 02:42:14.370
You are good at that.
I just don't,
I don't like.

2612
02:42:18.050 --> 02:42:18.883
Okay.

2613
02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:22.433
<v 6>Okay.</v>

2614
02:42:22.440 --> 02:42:26.160
<v 7>Hilarious.
Hilarious.
My veneer fucking fake teeth.</v>

2615
02:42:27.210 --> 02:42:30.690
What about like jackass stuff?
Don't find anything.
I loves it,
but you know,

2616
02:42:30.691 --> 02:42:34.140
I love it.
Sociopath.
Yeah.
No,
no,
no.
Because it's one of us.
No,

2617
02:42:34.200 --> 02:42:36.120
because it's not accidental.
Those are adults.

2618
02:42:36.300 --> 02:42:39.000
They're consenting and they're doing it of their own freewill.

2619
02:42:39.001 --> 02:42:42.200
That looks like an accident when they're accidental.
It's like,
oof.

2620
02:42:42.240 --> 02:42:42.841
They didn't want to do,

2621
02:42:42.841 --> 02:42:45.540
some of his buddy had looked in the camera right before and be like,
all right,

2622
02:42:45.541 --> 02:42:49.930
it's not for naked German wall jumps.
Yes.
And then I'd be like,
fuck yeah.

2623
02:42:50.550 --> 02:42:53.400
Yeah,
yeah.
Totally different stories.
Fair enough.

2624
02:42:53.460 --> 02:42:58.460
About last night is the podcast that Adam and Brad do together yet.

2625
02:42:59.430 --> 02:43:04.140
They're doing it for a men's drove for about five years.
Uh,
I've had Tommy on,

2626
02:43:04.200 --> 02:43:07.230

Bill Byrd,
Dana Carvey,
Mr. McCarthy,

2627

It's a lot of fun times.
Yeah.

2628
02:43:12.550 --> 02:43:15.700
<v 4>We got to have you on.
Brad told me when he was here,</v>

2629
02:43:15.701 --> 02:43:18.370
did he tell you I listened to that and he's like,
you gotta do it sometime.

2630
02:43:18.460 --> 02:43:21.520
And I was like,
I heard done it,
dude,
when I listened to him say at the end,

2631
02:43:21.521 --> 02:43:23.620
and I go,
you're closing the podcast with,

2632
02:43:23.740 --> 02:43:27.220
I don't remember you were on my podcast.
I scolded him.

2633
02:43:27.530 --> 02:43:30.580
He beat the shit out of him.
I just kind of like put my hand down

2634
02:43:32.190 --> 02:43:35.860
in palm tip toe yet.
Uh,
yeah,

2635
02:43:35.861 --> 02:43:39.750
we do it for about five years.
It's a long time.
Yeah,
it's a blast.

2636
02:43:40.150 --> 02:43:43.060
And I was just telling you were,
um,
oh wait,
no,
I can't say it yet.
Oh,

2637
02:43:43.061 --> 02:43:45.930
you can't what I was going to say about the,
Oh,
and don't forget,

2638
02:43:45.931 --> 02:43:49.440
you got to show me and we're going to wrap porn video.
Yeah.
And Adam,
Rick,

2639
02:43:49.441 --> 02:43:54.430
comedy.com for tour dates.
Um,
when's this coming out?

2640
02:43:54.700 --> 02:43:57.540
This will come out tonight.
Fuck yes.
Yeah.
Uh,

2641
02:43:57.580 --> 02:44:01.140
Tempe Improv next weekend and Arizona.
And then,
um,

2642
02:44:01.590 --> 02:44:06.250
January is a helium in Portland and Philly.
He read them.

2643
02:44:06.280 --> 02:44:09.550
It's a hard,
sorry.
Here in Portland,
in Philly.

2644
02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.490
And then Spokane comedy club.
Uh,

2645
02:44:12.550 --> 02:44:15.820
and then punchline in San Fran because they're all good.
They're all good.

2646
02:44:16.210 --> 02:44:19.060
And then a comedy works in Denver for the first time.
Oh,

2647
02:44:21.190 --> 02:44:23.650
I've only done the south on a pumps.
Oh,

2648
02:44:23.651 --> 02:44:28.540
get ready to ever go back to any other club.
I know.
We just did a live podcast.

2649
02:44:28.541 --> 02:44:31.960
They are bright and with John Heffron and Josh blue and it was like that.

2650
02:44:31.980 --> 02:44:36.500
Places on fucking real magic.
I don't know.
It's something about the,

2651
02:44:36.760 --> 02:44:40.420
first of all just underground comedy clubs I feel like are just a little extra

2652
02:44:40.421 --> 02:44:44.640
special.
Right.
And then the way it,
it just holds in the,
um,

2653
02:44:45.490 --> 02:44:48.970
it's where I think actually I'm going to premiere the trailer for a for fart

2654
02:44:48.971 --> 02:44:52.650
barrier be great.
Yeah.
That was at the screening.

2655
02:44:52.660 --> 02:44:54.130
You're going to be making a New York or no,

2656
02:44:54.280 --> 02:44:56.920
so I have a couple of scenes in this Jennifer Lopez movie called Second Act if

2657
02:44:56.921 --> 02:45:01.270
it's coming out.
I seen the billboards,
couple scenes in,
it might be,

2658
02:45:01.271 --> 02:45:04.310
I've been told a couple scenes.
It could be a couple lines,
but uh,
yeah,

2659
02:45:04.330 --> 02:45:07.660
it's always fun.
But the director of it,
I have known for a little bit,

2660
02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:09.160
it seems Peter Seagal.
Uh,

2661
02:45:09.210 --> 02:45:13.840
he was direct to Tommy boy and like 51st dates and nutty professor and,
and um,

2662
02:45:14.050 --> 02:45:18.880
sweet.
Threw me the sole thing and,
and uh,
and I just want to go and hang on.

2663
02:45:18.881 --> 02:45:21.400
I got a buddy that's going to go with me to the premiere and it's awesome.
Yeah.

2664
02:45:22.150 --> 02:45:26.910
Steven Seagal makes movies too.
Yeah,
his moves are really good out.
Oh yeah.

2665
02:45:27.290 --> 02:45:31.030
Yeah.
That's actually why I'm here.
Oh really?
Yeah.
We have a direct line.

2666
02:45:31.060 --> 02:45:35.770
I know he's,
yeah.
So bridge the gap because we're done here.

2667
02:45:35.810 --> 02:45:39.940
We can get your audition together.
Oh,
I already have a self tape ready to go.

2668
02:45:41.740 --> 02:45:44.280
Like in a file.
You look up a zip drive.
Um,

2669
02:45:44.680 --> 02:45:47.170
it's me doing all the lines of Gary Oldman from tiptoes.

2670
02:45:48.730 --> 02:45:52.900
Adam rate hilarious comedian.
Ghosty I'm live,

2673
02:45:57.460 --> 02:46:02.460
This a closing song is called a very handy guy by Galloway.

2674
02:46:04.780 --> 02:46:06.730
I Dunno.
That sounds,
