00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.980
<v 2>It is
a,
I found,
is that the,</v>

34
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.420
<v 0>that's you saying it?
Yeah,
that's it.
You saying it,</v>

35
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.160
you said it in a phone call while you were doing a press somewhere

36
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.660
<v 2>and they were like,
what's going on?
And then you,
you said,
oh yeah,</v>

37
00:04:09.661 --> 00:04:10.690
I remember that.
The,

38
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.830
this is that right when I was doing a huge press tour to like 140 radio station?

39
00:04:16.641 --> 00:04:21.300
Yes.
I think so.
All of your fans changed my Wikipedia page.
Yeah.

40
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.290
We're price your legs digging holes and maybe harms and you know what to open

41
00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:27.650
this show.
You know,
this guy took of that

42
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.580
<v 0>interview and he made,</v>

43
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.780
his name was gaping dad and he made an amazing song out of it.

44
00:04:33.781 --> 00:04:35.410
I don't know if you've ever heard it,
but here's just,

45
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.520
I won't play the whole thing again,
but here's a,
a portion of it.

46
00:04:38.521 --> 00:04:41.170
This guy took that interview.
I'm just serious like a,

47
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.660
at the skill level of some of the,

48
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.270
<v 2>I have none of those fans by the way.
No one ever.
No one ever.</v>

49
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.930
No one ever makes me songs.
No one ever makes me pictures.

50
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.630
Like everyone talks about,
oh my fans made these great artwork and I'm like,

51
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.670
I thought we all have the same fucking fans.

52
00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.260
<v 3>Oh my God,
I'm
already like this.</v>

53
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.980
I can do this and fucking garage band,
check it out.

54
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.900
<v 1>That's not that bad.
I couldn't do this.
I take that back.</v>

55
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.570
<v 2>That is one of the things that like,
it is,
it is the true thing of insanity.</v>

56
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.550
It's like,
uh,
cause we were,

57
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.100
we were talking about slut shaming because Georgia was talking to sandy about

58
00:05:40.101 --> 00:05:44.230
sound about her friends.
Uh,
I said something,
she fell and I was like,
oh baby.

59
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.870
She was crying.
I go,
baby,
why are you crying?
She's like,

60
00:05:46.871 --> 00:05:49.990
everyone likes him better than me.
And I was like,
no,
you're beautiful,

61
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.570
you're cool.
She's like,
Dad,
I'm not cool.
I'm going to know you are a cool.

62
00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:54.790
She goes down,
I'm actually not cool at school.

63
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.130
All the cool girls have been at least three boyfriends.
I go,
oh no,

64
00:05:58.131 --> 00:06:02.510
those are slots baby.
Their slots.
And I go,
that's how they're being cool.

65
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:04.910
Now it's a,
it's a shortcut but we'll come to high school.

66
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.020
When they want a data girl,

67
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:09.140
they're going to go to you cause no one's going to want to date a girl who's had

68
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:10.000
five boyfriends.

69
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.860
No one's going to want to marry the girl that's had five but a hundred

70
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:16.400
boyfriends snowman.
I go,
look,
I'm telling you about slut shaming for real.

71
00:06:16.401 --> 00:06:19.940
Cause I did it.
I was a part of the,
the bad part of slut shaming.
Like is it?

72
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.260
But I only because I go there are boys that are equal to you in life that
aren't,

73
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.160
that don't have a girlfriend.
And when they get to high school,
they see it,

74
00:06:27.161 --> 00:06:31.160
that same rejection you feel they will feel and apply it by calling them sluts.

75
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.740
That's how it's done.
I go,
I'm not for it.
And then my wife got ill,

76
00:06:34.741 --> 00:06:36.920
he got really upset.
She's like,
that's top of the fucking slut shaming thing.

77
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.980
But here's the crazy thing about slut shaming is said it's not real.
It's not,

78
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.730
these girls haven't done anything.
It will happen.
They've,

79
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.460
all they've done is like dated boys,
but then it'll get around.
It'll be rumors.

80
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.970
That's the thing with the fucking Burdis fat.
Yeah.
And even like it's,

81
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.910
is that you start,
by the way,
I was fat as fuck when that happened,
but like,
wait,

82
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.400
how surprised were you?
And that's true.
Wait,
because I was fat.

83
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.930
I was to 65 when that started.
I was two 65.
How do you think you got there?

84
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.740
For Real?
Oh,
I'm thinking about it.
Yeah,
I do.
Uh,
number one,
uh,

85
00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:10.200
I fell off a waterfall.
That was the number one.
That was the number.

86
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.770
<v 4>Cause what we're like,
let's say go back a couple of years.</v>

87
00:07:12.771 --> 00:07:13.820
What was your walk around weight?

88
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.440
<v 2>I was at 40 years old.
I was two 15,</v>

89
00:07:17.441 --> 00:07:20.780
two 16 and that was,
I was,
and I looked really good four years ago.

90
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.800
That's four years ago.
Yeah.
Travel Channel.
It's slowly built,

91
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:24.940
added on and added on.

92
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:29.290
I think I was floating around at two 35 probably what I was doing,

93
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.180
triple flip to 35 maybe,
maybe to 40.
Yeah,
I hurt.

94
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.450
I hurt my,
I blew out my,
uh,
Plantar Fasciitis,
uh,

95
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.750
playing tag football and I was getting back in shape and I,
and I couldn't walk.

96
00:07:43.751 --> 00:07:45.790
I couldn't run.
And that's what it started putting it on.

97
00:07:45.791 --> 00:07:48.910
And then when I fell off the waterfall,
and that's what I'm alone,
because I was,

98
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.120
I was addicted to oxy and value.
Oh my God.
Oh,
I was eating,
I was,

99
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.730
I was eating four.
I was taking oxy is four times a day.

100
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.460
Uh,
and I was taking four volumes of doubt.

101
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.310
I was taking them together and put the fucking Cabasa on that.
Good.
Yeah.

102
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.320
But that,
but that's what I,
cause I wasn't even getting out of bed.
I was like,

103
00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:09.423
I couldn't move.

104
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.840
I remember being in a bed in a hotel room in North Carolina and I couldn't get

105
00:08:13.841 --> 00:08:16.070
out because I couldn't reach my oxies or my,
well,

106
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.790
I can say oxies whatever they were vicodins whatever they were.

107
00:08:18.791 --> 00:08:20.530
I don't know if it was an what knocks the cotton,

108
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.460
but it was oxycodone or whatever.
It's going to rain or whatever,

109
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:25.990
whatever it was was pretty awesome.

110
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.750
They were really great and I couldn't get out of bed and I pissed in the bed

111
00:08:28.751 --> 00:08:31.030
because I couldn't get my get my pills because I couldn't,

112
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.180
I couldn't move my back.
Yeah.
But that,
I think that added on.

113
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.160
And then that last season of birth conquer,
I just power eight.

114
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.570
<v 4>This is what came,
this is why we brought it down.
I need to ask him.</v>

115
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.140
That's Gerard Depardieu and he was doing this.
Oh my God.

116
00:08:47.141 --> 00:08:48.330
That's why we were watching this movie.

117
00:08:48.331 --> 00:08:51.460
We were watching this movie and as a joke we were talking about the movie.
Yeah.

118
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:55.020
And the right before that whole thing took off,
I was like,

119
00:08:55.050 --> 00:09:00.050
oh he looks like he has Burt stomach and that and that day when we did that,

120
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:01.240
when we talked about that,

121
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:06.290
that's when we started to like talk about it basically that that day

122
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:11.140
<v 2>that was what,
but I didn't want a notice.
Like I really didn't catch on to it.</v>

123
00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:13.270
Like I'd see them,
but I'll be like,
hey,
I'm not fat.

124
00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.900
But I really was that and I was doing that weight loss challenge at the time.

125
00:09:16.901 --> 00:09:20.890
I was challenging myself to on most doodle blog and you guys watch it and you're

126
00:09:20.891 --> 00:09:23.350
like,
what the fuck you doing a Vlog for?
What are you 13

127
00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.570
<v 4>wait,
this is once it started though.
Once we started challenging you can go,</v>

128
00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:28.480
I think it was right before that.

129
00:09:28.481 --> 00:09:31.210
I think you saw that too number when he started doing blogs.

130
00:09:31.211 --> 00:09:34.810
It was when I was pregnant with Ellis and we all had dinner and he's like,

131
00:09:34.811 --> 00:09:36.940
look at this blue.
Oh that's your guys.
You guys were like,

132
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:42.550
I remember you'd be like fucking seriously.
Yeah,
cause it was at dinner.

133
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.540
What were you eating on birth to conquer or like what was your jam?

134
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.230
<v 2>Okay,
so no number one.
Uh,</v>

135
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.850
we used to do a thing called crew,
crew skis.
So we'd had a big crews.

136
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.400
And then what that would be was that I got to order for everybody and then I,

137
00:10:04.401 --> 00:10:05.670
and in doing that,

138
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.510
what I would do is I would order everything I wanted to eat and then we'd cut it

139
00:10:09.511 --> 00:10:10.650
up.
And you could sample thing.

140
00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.180
<v 4>Yeah,
I've been with you.
We did that in Montreal.</v>

141
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:17.650
It's the fucking best,
but you always order a lot when you,

142
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.590
<v 2>you always order a couple plates extra.</v>

143
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.020
So I was ordering and then it started turning out.

144
00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:24.450
When I go out to eat with people,
I'd order two meals cause I didn't want,

145
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.760
because I still use the cruise skis,

146
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.070
but having options that I didn't want one to suck and you know,
and they go,

147
00:10:29.071 --> 00:10:32.060
oh that was my meal.
So I had ordered two meals and then I'd,

148
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.200
I'd make it rain appetizers and a,
I think that,
and I switched over.

149
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.230
I was drinking a lot of beer at the time.

150
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.630
And so I think he's just started adding up.
I was just,

151
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.930
<v 4>no,
no,
I know I'm,
I'm thinking about it in my own thing.</v>

152
00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.450
Like I always been pretty big boy,

153
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.800
but it really got off the rails when she got pregnant.
It really was,

154
00:10:52.801 --> 00:10:57.510
we would go out to a who go out to practice every day and we'd always be like,

155
00:10:57.511 --> 00:11:00.150
got to have dessert for breakfast.
So I would,

156
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.263
<v 2>who are you?</v>

157
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.620
You're the one that I that I don't think people have it in their memory of how

158
00:11:05.621 --> 00:11:08.890
big you were.
How big were you at your biggest

159
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.180
<v 4>well,
what triggered,
like when I remember,</v>

160
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:13.610
you know you have like a weight you're comfortable with.

161
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:17.870
So I remember being like thinking that like two 45 for whatever reason was fine.

162
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.270
And then at two 55 I remember just being like,
yeah,

163
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.420
but that's like two 45

164
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:29.080
<v 2>or business.
I like to shave the hard corners off the truth.</v>

165
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.540
<v 4>Yeah.
Yeah.
So like if somebody said like,
how much do you weigh?</v>

166
00:11:32.541 --> 00:11:35.870
When I went to 55 I'd be say two 45 and in my mind I'd be like,

167
00:11:35.871 --> 00:11:39.080
that's not really a lie cause I'm like within range.

168
00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:45.220
And then I can actually remember getting on scales and seeing like two 58 and

169
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:49.820
two 61 and like I remember when it was,
when once it's across to 60 I was like,

170
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.770
you're definitely not close to 45 no more scales.

171
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:58.770
But the worst with that.
So that the one where I was like,
I really,
cause I had,

172
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.360
you know,
I had fucked with,
I mean I had trainers,
I had,

173
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.690
I had a trainer during her pregnancy and we used to go to boot camp together.

174
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.930
But I'm saying yes,
we used to go to bootcamp,
which absolutely was death,

175
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.280
but this trainer,
I mean he was really having me fucking do tire flips and like,

176
00:12:12.281 --> 00:12:12.790
you know,

177
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:16.510
then wind sprints then run over and do power cleans and like I would do these

178
00:12:16.511 --> 00:12:18.670
workouts that were like absolutely killing me,

179
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.060
but then I would eat absolutely everything afterwards.

180
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.740
Do you remember the time that we went and we did crossfit?
I was like,

181
00:12:23.741 --> 00:12:25.180
I think I burned like 10,000 calories

182
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:29.380
<v 2>through the time we did cross fit and then we went out with Chris.
I Walker her.</v>

183
00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:30.030
Yes.
Yeah.
With,

184
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:34.030
with the gay bars and we had so much fun and we're killing gay drinks,

185
00:12:34.031 --> 00:12:37.150
like all those sugary things.
And then at the end of the night we're like,

186
00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.610
I've were,
we did good today.
We went to crossfit,

187
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.600
crossfit and all we had were some vodka drinks and then Chris is like,

188
00:12:43.601 --> 00:12:45.760
who wants pizza?
We're like,
you're a trainer.

189
00:12:45.761 --> 00:12:48.640
You're supposed to be keeping us away from this.
And we murdered

190
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:52.610
<v 4>and we thought like if he's pizza,
yeah,
he's greenlighting.
Yeah.</v>

191
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:53.910
He's saying go ahead and do it.

192
00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.720
But that's the problem with exercise is that you don't gauge how much you should

193
00:12:57.721 --> 00:12:59.960
be eating because you won't get burned all these calories.
Yeah.

194
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:04.080
Do whatever you want to figure out that if you do that kind of exercise and then

195
00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.310
eat right,
then that,

196
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.400
<v 2>yeah.
Then it,
whoa.
My thing,
the I,
when I,</v>

197
00:13:10.401 --> 00:13:14.270
when we were doing that weight loss challenge,
I would just,
uh,
I would,

198
00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:16.490
I would eat very like lean and clean,

199
00:13:16.491 --> 00:13:20.540
like kind of like I am right now because of this challenge.
I love parameters.

200
00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:24.920
I love being challenged.
I love,
yeah,
I love to focus on stuff.
And uh,

201
00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:28.490
and then I take an Ambien at night and be like,
I'm not eating dinner.

202
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:33.080
I take an Ambien and I go to sleep and I wake up skinny.
Yeah.
And that's the key.

203
00:13:33.081 --> 00:13:36.110
If you can skip dinner.
Oh,
that's what I do.
Yeah.
That's how I lost weight.

204
00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:38.570
I weighed two oh eight when I delivered ls,

205
00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.930
so I had a lot of baby weight to lose and that was the single trick.

206
00:13:41.931 --> 00:13:46.100
I did no alcohol at night.
And don't eat dinner.
Why do you have to eat dinner?

207
00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:50.150
Have a bowl of vegetable soup and just go to fucking bed.
All of vegetable soup.

208
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.210
Janet's mood I like to do,
I'd like to make the girls,
uh,
vegetable.
Uh,
I make um,

209
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.830
uh,
uh,
matzah ball soup with chicken,
noodles and everything.

210
00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:01.640
And then I put two whole chickens in there and then I just pull out the chicken

211
00:14:01.641 --> 00:14:05.370
and eat the chicken with the broth or you go,
that's good.
That's great.
Yeah.

212
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.310
But the sweat pants also are a big,
uh,

213
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.970
a big codependent friend when you're gaining weight because if you wear it,

214
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.330
I started wearing sweat pants and hoodies everywhere.

215
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.880
That's the Billy Gardell died.
I love you Billy.

216
00:14:16.881 --> 00:14:20.910
But Billy who does wear sweat pants everywhere.
And I was like really?
Like,

217
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.220
but man,
they are like an enabler.
That's so true.
Like you're looking good,
Bert.

218
00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:30.200
You could sit criss cross apple sauce and then you go to put on your genes and

219
00:14:30.201 --> 00:14:31.840
your genes are like,
oh,
we need to talk.
Yeah.

220
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
<v 4>Jeans are always the,
uh,
the indicator of where you're at with your weight.</v>

221
00:14:35.001 --> 00:14:38.540
For me,
I can always tell where I am emotionally by which genes I can fit into.

222
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.020
Yeah.
So now look at your face today at your face.
Looks extra clear.

223
00:14:42.021 --> 00:14:46.120
Doesn't he look really like clear?
Yeah.
Like his eyes and,

224
00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:49.600
and you don't look puffy at all.
You look great.
They're really fat picture.
Yeah.

225
00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:53.580
Of you are meeting with me.
So this is uh,

226
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.100
right before weight loss challenge starts.
This is like,

227
00:14:58.101 --> 00:15:00.810
so this is the no wait,

228
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:10.970
no.
Oh my God.
Tom,
I know you're Super Husky.
What was that shirt?

229
00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:16.010
What size?
Shit.
What's that shirt like?
Triple x?
No.
Yeah.
You know I started,

230
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.200
my dad would buy me double axes.
Yeah.

231
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.020
And at the time when I started the weight loss I wanted to do,

232
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.840
I went to go run and I put on one of the double x is not knowing,

233
00:15:23.841 --> 00:15:26.570
it was a double act and it was still a little tight on my belly.
And I went,

234
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:30.290
Oh shit,
I'm a legit double X.
Is that,
oh it's scary.

235
00:15:30.291 --> 00:15:35.120
You know the most other painful thing is when like I saw people then and I see

236
00:15:35.121 --> 00:15:35.690
them now.

237
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:39.110
It's like it's a super narcissistic and they don't say anything and I'm like,

238
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.050
it just shows you like how people are only wrapped up in themselves.

239
00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:45.020
But I'm like,
yeah,
I'll be like,
yeah,
we saw each other last time,
odd ball.

240
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.660
And they'll be like,
yeah.
And I'm like,
I don't look different to you.

241
00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.230
And they're like,
I don't know.
Do you like Jesus Christ?
Man,

242
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:55.130
I lost like a fucking fifth grader.
And like,
they're like,
I didn't really notice.

243
00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:59.120
I get,
well,
I think I lose weight so quickly that everyone says it,

244
00:15:59.121 --> 00:16:03.600
that that one week they see me because I lost so much weight in,

245
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:04.680
uh,

246
00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.870
in like the first two weeks of December that everyone that saw me during pickup

247
00:16:08.871 --> 00:16:11.420
or drop off was like,
Holy Shit,
what happened?

248
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:15.560
But I lost probably 20 pounds that first two weeks.
Yeah,
I lost it.

249
00:16:15.561 --> 00:16:20.150
I lost a ridiculous amount of weight that just cutting out booze.
It's first.

250
00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:25.040
I bet you're just bloated first.
It's a lot of bloat.
And then it's also,
um,

251
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:29.700
it's just,
it's just saying to myself,
hey,
I can't eat everything I want.
Like,

252
00:16:29.701 --> 00:16:33.860
I like,
I,
that's,
that's,
that's what that guy was,
judge you.

253
00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:38.390
I never thought of anything like,
and I was still,
you know what,
as,
as others,

254
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:40.160
fat person thought that like,

255
00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:44.930
you don't realize until afterwards you think when you're fat that,

256
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:49.310
that other people don't enjoy food as much.
So like when someone,

257
00:16:49.311 --> 00:16:51.200
when you're like,
yeah,
you're like,
well,

258
00:16:51.201 --> 00:16:55.070
the reason that I'm eating these chocolate croissants is because I really

259
00:16:55.071 --> 00:16:57.870
appreciate the way they taste.
Like this guy who,

260
00:16:57.871 --> 00:17:01.850
who's not so it doesn't know good food.
And they were like,
no,
no,
no,
I know it.

261
00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.660
I'm not a pig so I'm not eating them all the time.
And then you're like,

262
00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:06.950
oh yeah,

263
00:17:06.951 --> 00:17:11.810
I thought that I thought that I was just somebody that enjoyed food and that's

264
00:17:11.811 --> 00:17:14.630
why I was eating and we just enjoyed a lot of it thing.

265
00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:19.550
And I noticed when I was getting fat,
I was pregnant.
Right.
But then after two,

266
00:17:19.551 --> 00:17:23.180
like you still,
like I was still eating the same way I was when I was pregnant.

267
00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.180
And then you feel out of control.
I didn't like that feeling.

268
00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.800
It was too much.
And it doesn't feel good.

269
00:17:30.801 --> 00:17:33.470
It feels better to have half the croissant.
Right.
Tommy?

270
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:36.640
Definitely once every now and then or whatever,
you know,
I go,

271
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:41.680
I go through such long periods now of going without sugar that I'll,

272
00:17:41.881 --> 00:17:45.440
I'll think of it as I'll think of the sugar as a reward.
So I'll be like,

273
00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:50.310
I haven't had like a,
a real sweet treat in a,
and then

274
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.210
<v 2>what happens is that like the,</v>

275
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:56.670
so there's this bill build up and anticipation for it and then when I have like

276
00:17:56.671 --> 00:18:01.110
even part of it I'm like sometimes I'm like as good but I don't want the whole

277
00:18:01.111 --> 00:18:04.350
thing anymore.
Like I'll just pay on it now.

278
00:18:04.351 --> 00:18:06.810
Cause part of it is that like the,

279
00:18:06.811 --> 00:18:09.000
it's not as good as you imagine it's going to be.

280
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.330
And a part of it makes me feel like I'm not that way with alcohol.

281
00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:16.030
When I built it up and I have it,
I go,
it's just as good as I remembered it

282
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.630
because like I feel like I,

283
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:24.450
but like a real alcohol buzz is really going to make somebody feel good morning

284
00:18:24.451 --> 00:18:28.570
beer.
Buzz is like one of my favorite things in the world.
Don't understand.

285
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:32.280
I don't understand that.
I'm talking about,

286
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.640
have you ever drank beer early,
early morning?
I mean I taught a cruise.

287
00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.390
Oh my problem is,
I don't know if it's,

288
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:46.050
I think it's a lyric and Miss Sheryl crow song,
that's how great it is.

289
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.170
I feel like,
I feel like booze,
daytime booze,

290
00:18:49.171 --> 00:18:53.430
90% of the time for me means a nap is 15 minutes away.

291
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.690
Feel like going to sleep.
I just don't have,
I,
I,

292
00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.860
I it has to be evening for me to enjoy.

293
00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.530
I have different perspective over these last two days because my,

294
00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.330
and I only say this because I think we,

295
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.140
I don't know if we talked about this or not,
but like,

296
00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.960
so when we started the October,
October,
October,

297
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:13.550
sober October a challenge and uh,

298
00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.450
been here over 10 minutes and haven't had any alcohol yet

299
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:23.900
by the way.
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't be the first time I your podcast,

300
00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:26.610
I walked in with a 12 pack.
I think I come off a plane.

301
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.540
Remember the last time we flew together?
Remember how big it was?

302
00:19:30.541 --> 00:19:34.980
Probably bigger than that
Styrofoam Cup.

303
00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:40.680
No,
a 30 to clarify those 30 12 to a vodka sodas I were making.

304
00:19:40.681 --> 00:19:45.660
We were a little out of control.
Yeah.
By the way.

305
00:19:45.661 --> 00:19:48.010
And I don't,
I haven't really figured it out.
And,
um,

306
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:51.990
I jumped in therapy tomorrow and I'm going to talk to my therapist about doing

307
00:19:51.991 --> 00:19:52.620
some,

308
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:56.940
I might just like while the girls are in school out of Burbank to a quick flight

309
00:19:56.941 --> 00:20:01.070
somewhere,
a quick flight back to just work on it.
But like the,

310
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:03.630
my biggest problem with booze is flights.

311
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:08.100
It's no questions asked the for you also just did it.
Okay.
Bye.

312
00:20:08.101 --> 00:20:11.190
I didn't think,
I don't know if I did it out of spite.
I don't know why.

313
00:20:11.191 --> 00:20:14.460
I don't know.
But how hard was,
it wasn't,

314
00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:19.050
so it was almost embarrassingly easy in that I want you to the airport.

315
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.280
And I went what was like,
oh wow.
I actually feel pretty good.

316
00:20:23.281 --> 00:20:25.330
I was real talkative.
I'm not,
not that I'm not talking about,

317
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:28.170
but when you are drinking in the morning you don't really talk to people.

318
00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:30.150
You just,
only because you don't want to look drunk.

319
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:34.860
Cause that's a real red flag of like why has he been drinking?
And you're like,

320
00:20:34.861 --> 00:20:37.320
well,
I'm scared of fucking flying,
but when you're not drunk,

321
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.450
I was very talkative and I was friendly and I,

322
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.590
and I got on the plane and I was like,
I was like,
okay,
I'm not freaking out yet.

323
00:20:43.591 --> 00:20:47.220
But,
but because you guys had said the challenge,
you need to enter October,

324
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.980
I didn't drink that evening.
Although everyone at DC I'm sure thinks I was.

325
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:54.070
I was drinking soda water.
They're like,
I,
I killed my soda water.

326
00:20:54.071 --> 00:20:56.600
And they went nuts and I was like,
Nah,
they don't want to tell him,

327
00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:01.510
let him think it.
But I think because I entered the morning sober,

328
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.760
I think I didn't have sour stomach,

329
00:21:03.761 --> 00:21:08.470
I didn't have like a sweaty at like a swamp ass.
Like all the things,
my brain,

330
00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:09.970
when I am hung over,

331
00:21:09.971 --> 00:21:13.180
I think it's when I'm hungover it will repeat things over and over again.

332
00:21:13.181 --> 00:21:17.770
Like the same lyric.
Shiloh,
when I was young,
Shiloh,

333
00:21:17.771 --> 00:21:21.070
when I was young,
it will just do that over and over again and it makes me crazy.

334
00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.160
And so I man,
when I was in Australia,
I'm telling you,

335
00:21:24.161 --> 00:21:26.530
you don't know how to control it unless you saw me in Australia.

336
00:21:26.531 --> 00:21:30.640
My tour manager was,
must have been like,
holy fuck,
I've been in a band for years.

337
00:21:30.641 --> 00:21:34.150
I've never seen one like this.
Really?
Yeah.
I mean the photos looked pretty crazy.

338
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:39.160
It was a great trip.
Sold out shows fucking amazing.
So happy I did it.

339
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:44.560
But because Sydney was 1500 and we were like half sold at the beginning of the

340
00:21:44.561 --> 00:21:49.290
tour,
I had to,
I had to literally fly,
perform,
fly,
perform,
fly,

341
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.330
perform,
fly,
perform.
Yeah.
And I,
I'm not good at that.

342
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.440
And that's not how the tour was set up.
The tour was set up,
fly,
uh,

343
00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:01.180
rest of the day off show the next day.
And that's totally doable.
But man,

344
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:01.961
I was,

345
00:22:01.961 --> 00:22:05.110
and they don't serve booze and the Quantas sounds until noon and all my flights

346
00:22:05.111 --> 00:22:09.160
were at eight in the morning.
Um,
you have no idea.
Like how bad I was.

347
00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.490
And then I go on this flight.
I know,
Dude.
I know,
I know.

348
00:22:12.491 --> 00:22:13.920
It sounds like fucking craziness.

349
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:17.350
<v 0>It's the morning alcohol that really,
and it's by the way,</v>

350
00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:22.450
in defense of other people,
cause I know you,
I know,
you know,

351
00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:27.460
I know how well you can manage your life and I know what's going on with you.

352
00:22:27.461 --> 00:22:31.510
But in defense of other people when they hear those stories is when people are

353
00:22:31.511 --> 00:22:34.450
like,
oh,
this guy's a fucking drink,
a maniac.

354
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:35.970
<v 2>Well,
drinking minute,
like,
uh,</v>

355
00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:39.790
I think Raj Rogan has been calling me a raging alcoholic,
which that's,

356
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:44.330
that's not accurate.
Only not because you never rage.
Yeah,
no,
but no,

357
00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:48.220
but I mean like,
I'm not,
I'm not,
uh,
I don't change.
I'm not,

358
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.001
I don't change who I am.

359
00:22:49.001 --> 00:22:51.700
And a lot of people I don't think can even tell him drunk when I'm drunk.
True.

360
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.450
And I'm not a mean person.
I think I'm a sweet person,
so,
and I don't,

361
00:22:55.451 --> 00:22:58.810
and it doesn't affect my life negatively and aligning,

362
00:22:58.811 --> 00:23:00.550
a lot of people would argue,
well,
you just haven't found your bottom,

363
00:23:00.551 --> 00:23:03.700
but I'm sure your bottom will show up in the form of liver cancer or something

364
00:23:03.701 --> 00:23:08.560
like that.
That's totally true.
But,
um,
but for the most part I think,
you know,

365
00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:11.050
all I can say is that when I got on that plane,

366
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:16.030
I was embarrassed that I had allowed what,
whatever.

367
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:20.030
I'd allowed myself to get that far away from just trying to get over flying.

368
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:23.620
And I was on the plane and I'm like waiting for it to rear its head.

369
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:27.460
I'm waiting for it to go to like craziness to happen.
It never showed up.

370
00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:31.290
And I went and an Ari and I talked about it this morning,
oddly enough,
uh,

371
00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.670
after I had breakfast with Joey,
who,
Joey and I talked about it.
But,
um,

372
00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:40.590
or is he doing sober October,
Joe?
Yes.
Yeah.
Is No,
no.
Uh,
yeah,

373
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:45.410
no hash
but,
or he's like,
you know,
when I was on,

374
00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.210
I'm,
I'm sure he's cool with me sharing anything with it,

375
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:51.230
but it's like when I was on depression pills,
they were like,

376
00:23:51.231 --> 00:23:54.800
sometimes you fix the problem,
but you still had the cast on.
So I might've,

377
00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:56.420
I might've,
I'm not saying I have,

378
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:59.300
but I might've fixed my fear of flying with all this drinking,

379
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:03.980
but I've been doing it out of habit.
So I think that for the most part is

380
00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:08.550
<v 4>right or the fear of flying is the justification to start the day drinking</v>

381
00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.900
<v 2>bad habit where you go,
you go,
I'm,
I'm allowed to do this.
This is how I</v>

382
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:16.210
<v 4>do.
You have to do this.
Cause I have this fear that needs to be managed.</v>

383
00:24:16.211 --> 00:24:18.670
But also like,
um,
it's a entry.

384
00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.940
Flying became a nice excuse to take the day off and drink.

385
00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:26.740
<v 2>Dude,
can I tell you that the one realization I had,
by the way,</v>

386
00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:31.600
I'm by no stretch of the means,
am I this like sober guy.
And by the way,
hey,
if,

387
00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.230
if you're my friend and you're in recovery,
don't hit me up.
I'm not in recovery.

388
00:24:35.231 --> 00:24:36.910
Okay?
Like I don't,
I don't plan.

389
00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.010
I'm not going to a fucking meeting and I don't want to go to lunch with you.

390
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:40.870
Like I don't want to sit and talk about sober

391
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:45.260
<v 4>stop.
I'm a regular fucking person
though.</v>

392
00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:49.320
Not Regular people.
No,
no.
I don't want to talk like sober talk.
Yeah.

393
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.660
I don't want to get into that shit.
I just want to live my life.
Why?

394
00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:53.730
What's wrong with the sober tower?

395
00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:58.950
<v 2>It's uh,
it's a little,
a little self involved.
It's a little like,</v>

396
00:24:58.951 --> 00:25:02.130
I just want to hang out with my kids and my family and workout and I,
and work.

397
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:06.010
The stuff that makes you drink.
No,
there's nothing that makes me drink.
I don't,

398
00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:10.080
I easily can not drink.
I have no problem with that.
I can easily not smoke weed.

399
00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:15.660
The,
I think my problem is,
uh,
once again,
and I,
and I,
this is the one realization,

400
00:25:15.661 --> 00:25:20.310
I have it in snow,
like Apifany,
but like,
I think it's,
it's,
it's an excuse.

401
00:25:20.311 --> 00:25:24.030
It's a habit that you get stuck into.
Like yet yesterday,
all I can say is that I,

402
00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:27.450
I landed and I was,
I've never done this.
I've never done this.

403
00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:31.740
I got a coffee at the airport and I was like,
I was like,

404
00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.950
I would never do that because I was like,
I don't want my stomach to turn on me.

405
00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:37.830
Like,
I don't want,
if I'm going have to shit halfway through at home.

406
00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:42.000
And so I got a coffee at the airport and was like,
and then called the Anna said,

407
00:25:42.001 --> 00:25:45.420
uh,
what are we doing today?
I've never fucking said that.

408
00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.930
And I've never been like,
what are we doing?
Everyone knows.

409
00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:53.840
<v 4>Do you know how that sounds?
I do.
I do.
I know.</v>

410
00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.650
What's the norm for you?
You get off the plane,
off

411
00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:59.590
<v 2>the plane,
come home,
take a nap,</v>

412
00:25:59.591 --> 00:26:03.970
have a cigar after scar taking nap guys.
Gotta re entry.
Uh,

413
00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.200
and then we go over to friend's house,

414
00:26:05.201 --> 00:26:08.260
have a big dinner and get over their own to everyone starts,

415
00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.100
everyone has more cocktails and then that's our Sunday.
It's not,
I mean it's not,

416
00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:15.190
but,
but I called her and I was like,
I was felt wide awake.

417
00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:20.020
She was like,
she was like,
oh,
well we're going to Iowa softball game.

418
00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.590
And I was like,
I said,
we ought to just started with softball up.
So I was like,

419
00:26:23.591 --> 00:26:26.850
fuck yeah,
let's go to a softball game.
And then we went down to a softball game,

420
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:28.780
went to Rei.
We did all this cool shit.

421
00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.170
And then I got home that night and I was like,
I kinda want to go for a jog.

422
00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:34.810
And I was like,
Oh fuck,
what world is this?

423
00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.870
Went for like a quick two mile jog just around the neighborhoods.
It was dark,

424
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:41.500
came back and was like,
uh,
I feel great.
I was like,

425
00:26:41.501 --> 00:26:43.230
I'm going to bed unassisted sleep.
By the way,

426
00:26:43.231 --> 00:26:45.870
I know that that's another thing that's going to fucking rock everyone's mind.

427
00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:48.900
I don't often go to sleep without drugs or alcohol.
Right?

428
00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.510
So it's not a big thing of mine.
Right.
I have a problem.

429
00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.120
Leanne can just close your eyes like a fucking Mormon and be like,

430
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:58.170
I'm doing thinking for the day,
click like I literally embed and go crazy.

431
00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:01.080
And Man,
I did let assisted sleep last night and I was like,

432
00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:04.710
in my head I was like,
this is pretty cool.
I was,
and then I was like,

433
00:27:04.711 --> 00:27:06.490
what am I gonna do tomorrow?
I was texting you guys.
Well,

434
00:27:06.491 --> 00:27:09.090
we went over to any in Cody's house.
I was texting you guys like,

435
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:12.930
are we doing yoga in the morning?
What do they think?
Nothing.
Your sisters know.

436
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:17.320
Leah said the same thing.
Nothing.
What do you mean?
Like it's not the,

437
00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.250
there's no difference in my personality.
There's no difference in anything.

438
00:27:20.251 --> 00:27:24.210
It's just what did they think of you embarking on,
you know,

439
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:29.040
the challenge so to speak?
Uh,
they,
they don't know like it sounds,

440
00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:33.030
my therapist was very much against it.
Why is that?
Why they're like,

441
00:27:33.031 --> 00:27:37.650
I've been very transparent with my therapist and uh,
he was like,

442
00:27:37.651 --> 00:27:40.500
I wouldn't advise you doing this before your trip to Australia and I wouldn't

443
00:27:40.501 --> 00:27:44.200
advise 90 days and I wouldn't advise doing it for a bet.
And I was like,
really?

444
00:27:44.201 --> 00:27:47.640
He goes,
yeah,
I mean,
he goes,
it just sounds like he goes,

445
00:27:47.641 --> 00:27:50.700
it just sounds like a bad idea to me.
And Lance,
like,
do it.
She's like,
look,

446
00:27:50.701 --> 00:27:54.120
I know you and these are the things that inspire you to change.

447
00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:58.470
We've dropped all that weight,
La last year.
I've kept it all off that,
that,

448
00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:02.910
that was changed,
legit change for me.
I think something like this for me,

449
00:28:02.911 --> 00:28:06.090
it gives me an excuse.
You have no idea.
You have no idea.
And I,

450
00:28:06.091 --> 00:28:08.040
and I say this in like,
I'm not,

451
00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:13.890
you have no idea how often people buy me drinks.

452
00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:15.540
Like it is,
it is,

453
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:21.830
I think it would over fucking welcome you to see how often drinks are given to

454
00:28:22.141 --> 00:28:25.010
me.
Like to the point when that,
that light,

455
00:28:25.011 --> 00:28:28.350
I show Saturday when I didn't want to drink,
Taylor Tomlinson was like,

456
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:32.520
this is like when you're not drinking.
I don't realize how often.

457
00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:37.050
Like it's just all over the place.
And so,
uh,
I was like,

458
00:28:37.051 --> 00:28:40.130
it's a nice excuse to say no.
Yeah.
Like it just to be like no.
Yeah.

459
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.870
<v 0>Doesn't that highlight to you like you saying that right now,
it doesn't,</v>

460
00:28:42.871 --> 00:28:46.320
that highlight to you how the people around you,
like your wife,

461
00:28:46.321 --> 00:28:48.510
your sisters would be like,
whoa,

462
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:52.620
<v 2>crazy.
You're going to take a month off?
No,
not my sister on the road,
on the road.</v>

463
00:28:52.621 --> 00:28:56.460
Not like families.
Never like,
you know,
but my family is all,
you know,

464
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:58.830
we drink when we get to.
Yeah,
of course.
But yeah,

465
00:28:58.831 --> 00:29:02.070
my sister Leanne has to know how you were so excited.

466
00:29:02.071 --> 00:29:04.650
She was like wanting to go on a walk with me and talk about what I'm feeling.

467
00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:08.340
I love it.
And she was like,
let's go for a walk,
go for a walk.
And I was like,

468
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.440
I was like,
I'm super like pensive.
The thing,

469
00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:15.360
the thing that's really bothered me is,
and by the way,

470
00:29:15.361 --> 00:29:19.050
I'm not like I did Dr Drew's podcast and he was like,

471
00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.940
everyone's saying that I needed medical assistance to stop drinking.
I was like,

472
00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:28.920
I was like a little blown away.
Well,
but,
but that's also like all the fans

473
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:34.000
<v 0>logical.
If a fan like a fan,
let's say a super fan of yours lives in,</v>

474
00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:36.510
I don't give a shit wherever Columbus and,

475
00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:40.930
and you went and he saw you at the show,
shirtless pound and drinks.

476
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.010
He hung out with

477
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:46.740
<v 2>you.
He saw 20 people by Utah.
Just shots and shots.
Right.
And then,</v>

478
00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:50.530
and then he also sees you on social media,
partying and sees your eyes,
I guess.

479
00:29:50.531 --> 00:29:52.750
That's right.
I guess that's right.
Then they go,
you go like I'm quitting.

480
00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.420
Like the normal healthy reaction reactions probably like,

481
00:29:55.421 --> 00:29:57.220
is that all right for you to do?
I mean,
yeah,

482
00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:00.430
but the one thing that's like I told you,
I ran into a guy,

483
00:30:00.431 --> 00:30:05.410
I ran into someone who's like,
I had a row or a rough week this week.

484
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.290
I found me should I go see a doctor if I don't want to drink tonight?

485
00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:11.590
And I think that misinformation,
uh,
Ha highlights people.

486
00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.440
Maybe they shouldn't drink that guy dying from true blood was the one guy.

487
00:30:14.441 --> 00:30:17.350
Everyone's like,
well,
if you drink a lot,
you can't just stop drinking.

488
00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:19.750
So that was one of the things that I get fans be like,
well,

489
00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:23.470
people think that some of them think that like you wake up and I start drinking,

490
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:24.510
you roll over.
Right.

491
00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:28.290
<v 5>And there's like a bottle of gin.
Yeah.
On Your nightstand and then you're like,</v>

492
00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:33.210
oh,
now I can sit up.
Yeah.
It's like,
uh,
what's the Vegas thing?
Oh,

493
00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:36.600
right.
Oh,
Nicolas Cage.

494
00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:39.300
It's not that for you.

495
00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.370
<v 2>Yes,
I'm running.
I'm,
no,
I got it.
Now here's another thing,
but like,</v>

496
00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:44.950
I'm running on a treadmill now.
I'm running on the open road,

497
00:30:44.951 --> 00:30:47.260
but the other day I ran five miles posted on my social media.

498
00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:50.740
Today I ran three and a half last night.
I ran to like,

499
00:30:50.741 --> 00:30:55.210
I'm running every fucking day.
I am working out.
I was going to crossfit like I'm,

500
00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.400
I'm living an active life.
Right.

501
00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:02.290
But I'm also partying at night when I'm home most often Tuesday,
Monday,
Tuesday,

502
00:31:02.291 --> 00:31:02.960
I'm not drinking.

503
00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.390
<v 5>And you're able to do this because of your Mickey Mantle genes.
Right.</v>

504
00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:10.390
That's my Mickey managing.
Yeah.
Now Bert,
can I ask you something that,
yeah,

505
00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:14.670
I mean that to me sounds really exhausting.
I'm 40 right?

506
00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:16.083
<v 2>You have,</v>

507
00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:20.610
I did not know how exhausting it was until I woke up this morning and went,

508
00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:22.770
oh,
I have to fucking fantastic.

509
00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.680
<v 5>Right,
because you're not,
you're not fighting the hangover.</v>

510
00:31:25.681 --> 00:31:28.810
You're not running to offset the effects of alcohol.

511
00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:32.610
Biggest thing before about when I look at Berg,
right.

512
00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:36.860
And like when I see what he's doing,
what I feel the most is tired.
Yeah.

513
00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:39.450
When I looked at him,
when I feel I'm exhausted,
man,
I feel like,

514
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.880
I feel like looking at what you're doing makes a lot.

515
00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:46.830
<v 2>Yeah.
Well I,
I think,
uh,
the one thing that I went to San Francisco,</v>

516
00:31:46.831 --> 00:31:49.770
I took two naps in one day with you.
I was,
I got to go lay down.

517
00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:51.420
I'm very punitive.

518
00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:55.740
So like I refuse to lay in bed and go feel so good today.
Yeah.
I go,

519
00:31:55.741 --> 00:31:56.311
if you don't feel good,

520
00:31:56.311 --> 00:31:59.100
get on the treadmill and let's run a fast mile on the treadmill.

521
00:31:59.101 --> 00:32:02.760
Now I know that that's not,
that's fake,
right?
Yeah.
But it is exercise.

522
00:32:02.761 --> 00:32:03.361
It is something,

523
00:32:03.361 --> 00:32:07.200
of course it's on heart rate's going up yet I will say that Joe was accurate in

524
00:32:07.201 --> 00:32:10.860
that running on the street is drastically fucking different.
So different.

525
00:32:10.861 --> 00:32:13.680
Pushing your body forward is very different than moving your legs up and down.

526
00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.460
But,
so,
um,
but I'm very punitive.
So like I would,

527
00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:21.420
I would just get up and go,
I've got to work out.
I got to,
I got to work out.

528
00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:23.790
I got to do something.
I can't just not,
I can't just lay,

529
00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:27.030
<v 5>but why can't see that's a thoughts.
I think that's the part where I'm hearing,</v>

530
00:32:27.031 --> 00:32:29.730
I'm like,
ah,
like my,
I just feel exhausted for you.

531
00:32:29.731 --> 00:32:34.070
Cause it's that self punishing element.
Like,
yeah,
that's the crazy to me,

532
00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:36.690
the I'm going at first it's the booze,
booze,
booze,

533
00:32:36.691 --> 00:32:39.150
and then I'm going to wake up and then I'm going to punish myself.

534
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.040
What I did then I

535
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:44.710
<v 2>think I have a little bit of OCD.
Yeah.
I think I have a little bit OCD,
uh,</v>

536
00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:48.410
and coupled with anxiety.
Why?
Why are they need to punish herself?

537
00:32:48.411 --> 00:32:52.340
Why can't you just relax?
Why can't you just sleep in if you're not,
I don't know.

538
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:56.030
We've talked about this.
You've taught,
Tom and I have talked about this a lot.

539
00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:00.680
I don't know.
I don't know what's wrong with me that I did.

540
00:33:00.681 --> 00:33:05.681
I overbook myself every fucking week that I'd never take a week off that I,

541
00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:07.843
I think

542
00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:10.853
<v 6>Aye.</v>

543
00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.860
<v 2>I have no fucking idea.
I can ideas.
I don't know.</v>

544
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.260
I think cause I feel like I'm not worth anything

545
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:20.600
<v 0>if you're like,
no,
I think part of you,
you know there's a fear aspect to it,</v>

546
00:33:20.601 --> 00:33:24.430
which is not unnatural.
Like fear of like,
you know,

547
00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:27.020
if I have things going away,
going away,

548
00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:31.810
like you have a fear of letting people down.
You have a fear of that,

549
00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:33.830
of someone not liking you.
Like

550
00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:36.580
<v 2>okay,
yeah you really do know these.
Keep going.
Yeah.
What else?</v>

551
00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.770
<v 0>So I think there's,
there's that.
I think the other thing is that like,
you know,</v>

552
00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.850
we all laughed about your certainty that you could run the marathon,
you know,

553
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:49.080
and then you were like,
after your start running out doors,
you're like,
hey,

554
00:33:49.081 --> 00:33:50.910
this is fucking way harder.
It's way harder.

555
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:56.500
But the reason I think the reason that you say I could definitely run it before

556
00:33:57.481 --> 00:33:59.760
you realize how difficult it would be because,

557
00:33:59.761 --> 00:34:04.490
because you think that's what a strong person would say.
Yeah.

558
00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:08.370
A strong person is confident.
If the person says,
I can't run the marathon,

559
00:34:08.371 --> 00:34:11.610
that person is weaker.
But in that scenario,

560
00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.790
I think the person that says I would need a lot of time to prepare for that

561
00:34:14.791 --> 00:34:15.290
marathon.

562
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:18.740
<v 2>That's what I was,
that's what I was just realistic.
Not Realistic because you,</v>

563
00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:22.670
because of your high probe hyperbole tendencies.
Cause like I definitely,

564
00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:25.660
I definitely,
today I was running and I was running,

565
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.980
I was running real slow and I was like,
I was like,
what's going on?
Like,

566
00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:33.560
and I was like,
oh I did have a cigar this weekend.
Like is that it?

567
00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.870
Within like I was like,
fuck man,
I'm running into,

568
00:34:35.910 --> 00:34:40.850
I was running it at 10 minute and 22nd pace and it was hurting.
And I was like,

569
00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:44.180
I was like,
shit man,
this isn't,
this is five hour marathon pace about,

570
00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:46.370
it's about 11 minutes about that.
And I was like,
fuck,

571
00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:51.350
I don't know if I could do this for 26 more miles.
And I was like,

572
00:34:51.351 --> 00:34:53.900
I really couldn't.
But then part of me said

573
00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:00.260
I bet I could punish myself into it.
Yeah.
Like I bet I could hurt myself into it.

574
00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:01.010
I bet I could.

575
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:05.840
That's the other part that like I think that I put in the equation as I go.

576
00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.070
<v 6>Aye.
Aye.
Aye.</v>

577
00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:10.610
<v 2>I like when we did that weight loss challenge,</v>

578
00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.900
I didn't have a problem eating less than a thousand calories a day.
I did my,

579
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:18.080
I'm punishing myself into losing the weight and I'm sure,

580
00:35:18.081 --> 00:35:22.100
I'm sure someone's like,
man,
this,
uh,
this drinking thing,

581
00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.800
you're just pulling your shirt.
Here's punishing yourself by not drinking.

582
00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:28.180
I'm doubled up my therapy and I'm trying to figure it out.
I'm writing,

583
00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.230
I'm writing every morning.
I'm writing as I,

584
00:35:30.231 --> 00:35:33.470
as much as I can about my thoughts and my feelings because what I would like to

585
00:35:33.471 --> 00:35:35.780
do ideally would,
uh,

586
00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:39.720
would be get done this month and then go to New Orleans and have a good time and

587
00:35:39.721 --> 00:35:44.160
not get fucking crazy like crazy and just have a good time and reset my clocks

588
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.610
so that I can enjoy alcohol and enjoy marijuana.

589
00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:52.110
But it's not I,
but I,
I really think if I could,
if I can get my fucking,

590
00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:55.800
<v 4>well we are we just hearing,
wait,
you're telling me that you're,</v>

591
00:35:56.190 --> 00:36:01.190
you're doing your sobriety so you can plan the getting fucked up trip after the

592
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.513
trip is happening.

593
00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:05.640
I had definitely had a lot of phone calls with everyone that works with me

594
00:36:05.641 --> 00:36:07.620
saying,
you will be drinking on this trip.

595
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:10.170
People have bought tickets to drink with you on this trip.

596
00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:15.920
But you know that like,
I mean,
we don't plan trips that just,

597
00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:18.190
just to get,
just to enjoy was,

598
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:21.800
it is a booze cruise cruise,

599
00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:23.960
but the whole car,

600
00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:27.560
I don't think anyone had gotten a ticket to play shuffleboard with me.
Oh,
right.

601
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:31.290
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize.
I thought it was time out in New Orleans.
New Orleans,

602
00:36:31.291 --> 00:36:34.810
they're going to depart from,
Oh,
I'm always going to be,

603
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.410
or he's going to be their big Jay's going to be there.

604
00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:41.190
I thought you were planning a trip to get fucked up.
Oh,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

605
00:36:41.191 --> 00:36:45.000
It's the impractical jokers.
I misunderstood.
I thought you were planning this.

606
00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:46.890
No,
no,
no,
no.

607
00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.990
<v 2>If I didn't have that trip and the answer this,
if I didn't have that trip,</v>

608
00:36:49.991 --> 00:36:51.880
I probably wouldn't start drinking again right away.

609
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:56.560
But I'm going to be with Ari at midnight in the French quarter on Halloween and

610
00:36:56.561 --> 00:37:00.070
that's when the bets over.
So I know I'm going to drink with Ari and so,

611
00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:01.390
but I would like to like,

612
00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:05.840
I'd like this month to simply reset my buttons and go like,

613
00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:11.170
like,
uh,
just if you feel good,
I'd like to get,

614
00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:14.650
I talked to already today a long for a long time and he's like,
he's like,
Bro,

615
00:37:14.651 --> 00:37:16.780
I don't think you have a drinking problem.
He sent that,

616
00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.170
he put out a podcast today where he just hates us and he's like,

617
00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:21.480
I don't think if we're drinking probably a lady.

618
00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:26.170
<v 4>Yeah.
Oh yeah.
It's just about hating us and he's just so mad.
I like that text.</v>

619
00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:31.250
Oh yeah.
But it's tax was 34 minutes of that text.
He was just like,

620
00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:33.430
this is ruining,
right?
This is so dumb.
I don't have a problem.

621
00:37:33.431 --> 00:37:37.600
I don't want to fucking participate in this.
And he went,
he was like super angry,

622
00:37:37.601 --> 00:37:40.960
super mean and attacks the normal,
right.

623
00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.050
Normal.
And then I sent,

624
00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:47.470
I sent a text where I misspelled something and everyone was like,

625
00:37:47.471 --> 00:37:52.330
are you fucked up?
I was like,
yeah,
I'm hammered.
I quit.
I'm not doing it anymore.

626
00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:54.030
So I talked to her today.
I was

627
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:57.450
<v 2>like,
I was like,
dude,
in this month at all,
everything's up in the air.</v>

628
00:37:57.451 --> 00:37:59.970
Like if I choose to quit drinking forever,
I choose to quit drinking forever.

629
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.970
That's up to me by the way.
Of course.
But if I,
but,
but the point is,

630
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:06.360
I never once ever planned on stop drinking in my life.

631
00:38:06.361 --> 00:38:09.000
Even when we started this bed,
I was like,
I still want to enjoy cocktails.

632
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:13.200
I didn't say that.
You did say that.
Yeah.
I love a cocktail.
I love,

633
00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:17.170
um,
and I know this,
but my Achilles heels though,

634
00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:19.950
there's planes and I think it spins me out of control.
It shows though.

635
00:38:19.951 --> 00:38:23.160
And I know you don't,
I don't like that,
but can I rephrase that?

636
00:38:23.161 --> 00:38:27.590
Can I rephrase that?
Yeah.
I said I'd never performed drunk and I,

637
00:38:27.591 --> 00:38:31.440
and I don't for an early show I would maybe bring a cocktail.

638
00:38:31.441 --> 00:38:32.274
I won't even touch it.

639
00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:35.590
But I realized this weekend when I did those show stone sober,

640
00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:39.820
if you said I couldn't drink,
that's a different box to put me in cause I like,

641
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:41.260
cause I was like,
I'm not drinking.

642
00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:45.610
And then on that late show they were hammered and I was like,

643
00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.730
and my instinct is like,
I'm going to get a cocktail and loosen it.

644
00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.780
I'm going to fucking make this fun for me too.
Yeah.

645
00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.530
But when your stone sober and they're fucking wasted.
Yeah,

646
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:55.680
it's a tad bit annoying.

647
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:58.000
<v 4>Yeah.
It's called late show Friday.
Welcome to my personnel.</v>

648
00:38:58.410 --> 00:38:59.490
<v 2>Yeah.
Oh my God.</v>

649
00:38:59.491 --> 00:39:04.200
Those my in minor late show Saturdays are out of fucking control.

650
00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:07.590
Like to the point where Taylor Thompson who was,
has been working with me,

651
00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:12.060
we were in San Antonio and from stage she asked a bouncer to come to walk her

652
00:39:12.061 --> 00:39:13.200
off stage.

653
00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:18.090
<v 4>Wow.
Yeah.
She was like,
I'm not feeling entirely safe with this audience like it,</v>

654
00:39:18.091 --> 00:39:21.750
but he's just fucking chaos.
You know what,
I realize we've never done this.

655
00:39:21.751 --> 00:39:23.940
We were already all this time into the show,

656
00:39:23.941 --> 00:39:26.410
we didn't play any open will Bartow family.

657
00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:30.590
But let me just play one thing just for sure.
For the old school people.
Sure.

658
00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:31.650
To open the show.
Okay.

659
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:40.430
Who's this?
Oh,
this fucking asshole slur.

660
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:43.540
Ski.

661
00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:57.213
Yes.

662
00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:10.590
<v 1>Nice.
All right.
Don't bring anyone</v>

663
00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:19.440
to your mom so we won't play the whole thing,
but we always have to play a clip.

664
00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:22.240
You realize Christina,

665
00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:28.490
what times or what times are a cost question or a hot yoga class?
Uh,

666
00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:30.360
I think,
let me double check.

667
00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:35.500
<v 4>I think we have a hour and a half or so until it starts to lower part.</v>

668
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:39.020
You know,
I think what's really interesting for you this month and I think,

669
00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:42.630
<v 2>can we,
can I tell,
can I jump in and tell you something that I,
that I,</v>

670
00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.060
I was saying to someone the other day and I,
but I share this with you guys.

671
00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.920
I regret how honest I am too.

672
00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:52.230
Like I hate that I don't have that branding sensibility where I can brand myself

673
00:40:52.231 --> 00:40:55.590
to be cooler than I am.
Like,
I hate that I'm too honest.

674
00:40:55.810 --> 00:41:00.290
<v 4>No,
it's called no boundaries.
Yeah,
it's bad.
Do you think that like no boundaries,</v>

675
00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.640
I'm guys pretend to be cool.
Is that you're saying or

676
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:07.040
<v 2>no,
but like all the talk we do about booze,
I,
I can't lie.</v>

677
00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:13.330
<v 4>No,
it's not that.
It's that there's,
you know,
public versus private.
I don't,</v>

678
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:16.610
no,
I don't,
I don't have,
no,
you don't do that.
We know.
We know.

679
00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:21.860
But I know there are no boundaries between what's inside and what's outside.

680
00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:24.720
And maybe that's something to examine and you're sober.
Okay.

681
00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.080
<v 2>No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I don't want it.
No.
Let me tell you something else.</v>

682
00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:31.240
I'm not gonna mention a fucking name,
but I'm not that person who is a,

683
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:36.120
is a lie on stage.
Oh No.
And,
and there are people that I see on stage,

684
00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:39.950
like friend,
no,
just people that are alive on stage rely on their Instagram.

685
00:41:39.951 --> 00:41:43.520
Ally lie on everything.
And it's a brand though.
This is my brand.
Like

686
00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:46.260
<v 5>I'm not that guy.
I don't think that's what that means.
I think that,</v>

687
00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:50.700
I think that that's my brand.
I think it can be a comedian.

688
00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:54.540
And then there's some stuff that you don't have to share with everybody too is

689
00:41:54.541 --> 00:41:56.720
what I mean.
Yeah.
That's all I don't think.
No,
no.

690
00:41:56.730 --> 00:42:00.510
And you can still filter your real stuff through creative stuff.
Yeah.

691
00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:02.850
And also maybe the self punishing stuff.

692
00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:06.090
I think it's Kinda neat that you'll at least the sobriety it'll,

693
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:10.830
it'll lift the fog of booze to be able to think about the self.

694
00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.470
Why no self preservation.
Do you know what I mean?

695
00:42:13.471 --> 00:42:17.280
Self care I think is what the shrinks call it.
You know,
why are,
why,

696
00:42:17.281 --> 00:42:20.150
why the overscheduling and the self flagellation

697
00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:25.350
<v 2>well I'll tell you right now.
I already started last night I started,</v>

698
00:42:25.351 --> 00:42:28.140
I signed up for like a bunch of these classes that I've always wanted to take.

699
00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:33.270
Oh no,
that's great.
No,
no.
My wife's like stop,
cancel one.

700
00:42:33.271 --> 00:42:36.370
You're not doing three different cause now you're just filling your schedule.

701
00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:39.720
My schedule.
You do the same thing.
We've talked about this with the road.

702
00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:40.920
Interesting.
Yup.
Right.

703
00:42:40.921 --> 00:42:44.760
Who are scheduling overscheduling I I do way too many dates.

704
00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:47.010
I'll throw a call in sick to work show at college,

705
00:42:47.011 --> 00:42:50.460
I throw all of it on to one thing and then you also do like four weeks in a row,

706
00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:53.490
one week off,
six weeks in a row.
One way like it's just,
it's way too much.

707
00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:53.820
But I'll,

708
00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:58.170
it's also kind of like in lieu of going to the store every night and working
out,

709
00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.210
I work out on the roads so totally get that part,

710
00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:05.510
but it is like you're gone a lot when you do that on a great amount and I'm so

711
00:43:06.391 --> 00:43:10.710
grounded when I'm home that like I literally was saying to my friend the other

712
00:43:10.711 --> 00:43:13.530
day,
I was like,
I think I,

713
00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:18.420
I think I've been stuck in this podcast stand up ma mantra since I got out of

714
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:21.450
travel channel this past year.
I know pat kept passionate,
do TV.

715
00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:26.220
I've got a project,
I've had a project in the bullpen waiting for us,

716
00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:30.300
waiting for me to greenlight the script and I just talked to my buddy the other

717
00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:33.180
day and I was like,
I'm not,
I'm just not in it.
I'm,
I'm sorry man.
Yeah,

718
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:36.510
like I'm not in it.
I don't really have any passion right now.
Like I just don't,

719
00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:39.690
my passion is doing stand in and getting ready for this next hour.

720
00:43:39.691 --> 00:43:43.230
That's where my head's at and then this week I was like,
Oh,
you know what?

721
00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.410
I think I'm going to,
I think I'm going to revisit this project,

722
00:43:46.411 --> 00:43:49.080
but I think I'm gonna revisit a different way and I think I'm going to try to

723
00:43:49.081 --> 00:43:50.440
get passionate about something like that.

724
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:55.680
<v 5>But Bar,
if you know that being home is best for you emotionally,
it,
it,</v>

725
00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:58.840
it stabilizes you.
Then maybe the,
I mean,

726
00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:02.880
I guess one of the goal be to maximize the time out so that you,

727
00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:06.960
you make your money in the shortest time possible and then your home and then

728
00:44:06.961 --> 00:44:10.700
you can be,
you know,
you can feel better.
That's all I'm saying.
Like,
yeah,

729
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:11.543
I feel it feels better.

730
00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:16.120
<v 2>It would,
my life would be,
that is a really interesting insight.</v>

731
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:21.150
My life would be drastically different if I would do a weekend and then take a

732
00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:27.940
week off and then like Joey a weekend and then say,
go,
we call sounds easy to do,

733
00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:32.850
but then what happens is they go a weekend and then,
hey,

734
00:44:32.851 --> 00:44:35.790
we got this college and they're like,
I was pretty good money for wanting show.

735
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:39.270
Here's the thing.
I wait,
wait,
wait.
Hold on.
No,
no,
no.
Backing up.
Okay.
Yeah,

736
00:44:39.271 --> 00:44:40.770
that's good money.
Great.
Well,

737
00:44:40.771 --> 00:44:44.280
can we push that offer to next quarter when I have an open,
it's just right now,

738
00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:49.060
Joe.
Okay,
so then pass,
cause guess what?
My team Joey just said Joe.

739
00:44:49.061 --> 00:44:53.070
He just had this conversation with me and I was like,
I know he was,

740
00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:56.430
he got offered some thing and it was in between two things.
Like no dog.
Right?

741
00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:59.730
You got to be these two fucking days.
Pick one.
Right.
I wish I do that.

742
00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:03.620
Here's the thing.
No,
no,
no,
no.
Here's the thing.
I,

743
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:08.370
I'm not to get too esoteric about about this,

744
00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:12.800
but this has been very,
this has been a very extraordinary year for me in,
in,

745
00:45:12.801 --> 00:45:14.820
in the word extraordinary,
not,
it's been good,

746
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:17.490
but it's been extraordinary in that it's not,

747
00:45:17.491 --> 00:45:21.870
it's not been regular and it's been a little overwhelming emotionally,
you know?

748
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.980
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

749
00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:26.660
<v 2>I should probably bite my tongue,</v>

750
00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:29.960
but I will be very honest because I've always been honest with Tom about

751
00:45:29.961 --> 00:45:34.550
everything
in December,

752
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.750
New Year's Eve,
unmoved,
no tickets at levity live.

753
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:43.760
They lost their ass on me.
Like I moved no tickets.
I did my special for showtime.

754
00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:47.030
I did Dayton.
I remember calling and going,
uh,

755
00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:50.600
sold out for the week and then found out they paper the entire room that they

756
00:45:50.601 --> 00:45:53.230
didn't even read my contract.
They just papered the room,
no tickets,

757
00:45:53.231 --> 00:45:56.660
removing moving paper the fucking room.
November,
December,

758
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:59.090
I was supposed to do a tour with Tom.
All of it got cancelled.

759
00:45:59.091 --> 00:46:01.340
I got fired from travel channel.
I,

760
00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:05.210
I was probably at my lowest when we started that weight loss challenge.

761
00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:07.970
And I'm getting just hate from everywhere on the internet,

762
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:12.850
like posting stuff on Instagram.
And it's just destroy me.
And then,
uh,

763
00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:15.320
I think a couple by the fact that we did that weight loss challenge,

764
00:46:15.321 --> 00:46:18.880
the machine story goes viral and all of a sudden,
uh,

765
00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:24.280
I start selling out and I sell out every single show this year.

766
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:27.780
And you,
and it's like,
I hope,

767
00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.440
I don't know if you're gonna be able to speak to have this experience Tom,

768
00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:34.250
but it's like a near death experience.
It's like,
it's like,
uh,

769
00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:38.210
I remember a palm frond almost landed on my head one time in Marco Island.

770
00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.250
It missed me by an inch and I didn't even see it.
Captive Orion.
Yup.

771
00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:45.770
It's gone now.
Thank God
of Brian.

772
00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:49.850
So,
but I remember it missed me and this French guy was like,
you are a lucky man.

773
00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:53.810
You don't know how lucky you are.
You should really seize the day.
And I was like,

774
00:46:53.811 --> 00:46:56.540
whoa.
And I was just going to get a cup of coffee.
I was hung over and I was like,

775
00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:00.860
fuck it.
I'm going for a jog this minute.
I have my life.

776
00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:03.620
I fucking hate my life.
I went from,

777
00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:08.630
from something where like I was doing it and not a lot of people cared to then

778
00:47:08.631 --> 00:47:12.350
people caring.
And I think it's like a near death experience where you go,

779
00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:15.350
I'm going to really live my life.
I'm going to really take,

780
00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:18.740
take these opportunities as best I can.

781
00:47:18.741 --> 00:47:23.741
I'm very lucky and blessed that I can fill a calendar and then I can make money

782
00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:27.380
and then I can put a pool in and I'm not going to piss this away.

783
00:47:27.381 --> 00:47:31.530
I'm not going to like just,
you know what guys?
I know.

784
00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.370
Granted I think what you're saying is right.
Yeah.

785
00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:37.470
<v 5>Working smarter isn't the same and you can,
you can make your money and,</v>

786
00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:39.410
and do it more efficiently.

787
00:47:39.411 --> 00:47:42.710
So it's like you're taking care of yourself physically,
emotionally,

788
00:47:42.711 --> 00:47:44.660
spiritually too.
You know what I mean?
So what,

789
00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:49.280
what good are you to your family if you're dead at 50 cause you're working 51

790
00:47:49.281 --> 00:47:51.860
weeks out of the year,
you're gonna you're burning it out,
right?

791
00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:55.380
<v 2>Yeah.
But I think harmful,
but it's been good.
But I think,</v>

792
00:47:55.381 --> 00:47:56.211
can I just say this like,

793
00:47:56.211 --> 00:48:00.060
I think you're also speaking from your guys's perspective.

794
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:01.650
Like I would,

795
00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:06.100
I would s I would say someone that is wasn't my situation in December.
No.
Would,

796
00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:08.340
it would definitely go Berber you're doing the right thing,
right.

797
00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:10.250
Get the money while you can.
Yeah.
Right.

798
00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:14.050
<v 0>It makes more sense to hear you explain it that way.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

799
00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:17.460
but I think also now that you're,

800
00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:22.050
now that you're 10 months into this year and like you've,

801
00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:24.390
you've been doing what you're doing.
I mean,

802
00:48:24.391 --> 00:48:29.250
you probably do see how it isn't the way to live,
right?

803
00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:34.130
<v 2>Yeah.
I can't,
I can't do it.
Like next year I can't,
I,
I'll tell you this,</v>

804
00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:38.480
I'm doing it until February only because I'm shooting a special and February in

805
00:48:38.481 --> 00:48:42.800
Philly and I know that the two months before I shoot a special,
I am out.

806
00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:46.760
I'm doing standup every as much as I can to get ready for the special.
Sure.
It's,

807
00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:48.760
it's how I write.
I feel like I,
I,

808
00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:52.550
I paid the base all year and then when I go in,

809
00:48:52.551 --> 00:48:55.550
I start looking at it and I go,
oh,
these are the clothes lines.

810
00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:59.310
And that's those two months and a like.
I think December's a little bit of that.

811
00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:02.660
But you're right.
I think coming this next year,
I would like to not,

812
00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:06.290
I'd like to do what Tom does where he just goes and does.

813
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:07.420
<v 0>Okay.</v>

814
00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:11.810
<v 2>You know?
But I also,
I,
today I couldn't do what Tom does when you,</v>

815
00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:15.450
when I see you on a plane going to do a fucking interview and mantra and in what

816
00:49:15.451 --> 00:49:19.570
you would call it and then do a show that night.
Yeah,
I saw that.
And I was like,

817
00:49:19.571 --> 00:49:24.290
oh,
I'd have to be blotto drunk to get on that fucking Barbara.
Jut Really?
Yeah.

818
00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:28.460
Yeah.
And now,
now after now having that one one fight under my belt,
I go,
oh,

819
00:49:28.461 --> 00:49:32.480
maybe I could do a pro.
Maybe I could fly on perform.
Maybe I could.

820
00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:37.060
<v 0>Good man,
you can't.
I think what your,
your actual,</v>

821
00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:42.270
what you just explained made me understand your decision making because you're

822
00:49:43.151 --> 00:49:45.850
like,
I got it.
I got,
I have to take these offers.

823
00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:51.070
But I think having gone through this year,
you have to realize how,

824
00:49:51.071 --> 00:49:54.550
you know what,
it's not fleeting in the sense that it's like,
Hey,

825
00:49:54.551 --> 00:49:59.110
it's gone tomorrow.
You can tell agents that say like,
Hey,

826
00:49:59.111 --> 00:50:04.030
so,
uh,
fucking DC it's,
it's um,
whatever.
It's October 1st.

827
00:50:04.031 --> 00:50:07.510
You can be like,
no,
like look this,
get the schedule's too crazy.

828
00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:11.260
Let's put them on the calendar for December,
January.
You know what I mean?

829
00:50:11.261 --> 00:50:13.660
Like you can spread it out but you,

830
00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:17.470
they will always take advantage of,

831
00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:22.450
<v 5>of me saying yes,
yes.
Always.
Our job is to bring you off or off only change</v>

832
00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:26.020
<v 0>if you,
you know,
you can set up a thing where you go,
like,</v>

833
00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:28.190
I'm telling you guys now I

834
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:32.870
<v 4>need a week off in between weeks.
That's the,
that's the new plan.</v>

835
00:50:32.871 --> 00:50:37.160
So book,
whatever,
you know,
bring me whatever you want.
But it's got to be week on,

836
00:50:37.161 --> 00:50:38.870
week off,
week on,
week off.
If you,

837
00:50:38.871 --> 00:50:42.380
if you tell them that like that's a Bert decision,
you know,
they're,

838
00:50:42.381 --> 00:50:44.240
they're going to respect it.
They're going to bring you things,

839
00:50:44.241 --> 00:50:45.740
but they're going to respect your decision.

840
00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:50.240
It's always their job to try to step your boundary.
It's the agent's job to go,

841
00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:55.010
yeah,
I know you're in,
uh,
South Carolina.
Would you mind tacking on Richmond?

842
00:50:55.011 --> 00:50:58.850
And you're like,
no,
you're not.
You know,
it's true that like,

843
00:50:58.851 --> 00:51:01.040
you do love that time here

844
00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:05.780
<v 2>dude.
I love it.
Healthier for it.
I love it so much that I,
that I,
but I,</v>

845
00:51:05.781 --> 00:51:09.170
but you gotta realize I haven't had it.
I haven't had it in 10 months.

846
00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:12.740
I haven't had,
I haven't had a week off in 10 months.
I've haven't had shit off.

847
00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:17.120
I've been working almost,
I mean,
I mean,
no one's going to speak in hyperbole,

848
00:51:17.121 --> 00:51:19.670
but like I've been working nonstop now.
Yeah.

849
00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:23.570
And like the Australian tour was like two weeks straight and I just was like,

850
00:51:23.571 --> 00:51:27.080
and I looked at your Australian tour and it's like five days.
Yeah.

851
00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:30.830
Five fucking days.
And I look at mine and it's fucking two weeks and I'm like,

852
00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.260
and then I go,
am I,
what am I doing this wrong?

853
00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:36.980
Like I started like getting angry at people going like,

854
00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:42.830
like jr when I DC wanted died to Sunday shows and I was like,
no,

855
00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:46.340
I was in Australia when they asked great time to ask.
I was like,
no,
no,
no.

856
00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:50.170
And they're like,
well,
they'll give you,
you know,
we talked about percentages,

857
00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:52.550
but they'll like,
they'll give you what you want.
And I was like,
no,

858
00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:56.390
I'm not doing it.
I already told you I wanted to add those a month ago.

859
00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.730
They should have got it a month ago when I said yes,
I said,

860
00:51:58.731 --> 00:52:03.080
no sober October starts fucking nap.
Well that Sunday I want to be home.

861
00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:04.733
Thank God I got it.

862
00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:07.890
<v 4>Fuck out of.
Right.
And so you turned down money and you turn down a show,</v>

863
00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:12.990
<v 2>correct it,
I had gotten booked into cap city without my knowledge.
Like I,</v>

864
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:16.230
I just,
I guess I had said yes,
but I don't,
I didn't know it.

865
00:52:16.231 --> 00:52:17.330
It wasn't on my calendar.

866
00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:21.500
And then I started and then I saw it pop up on my calendar one day and I was

867
00:52:21.501 --> 00:52:24.020
like,
whoa.
I was like,
you got to cancel cap city.

868
00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:26.660
Do you know how hard it was for me to cancel cap city?
First of all,

869
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:30.320
I have such this thing where I go,
I want them to like me.
Yeah,

870
00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:31.320
like our warranty talking about,

871
00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:34.260
<v 4>well you don't want to say no cause are you afraid of what will happen if you</v>

872
00:52:34.261 --> 00:52:35.094
say no?

873
00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:40.330
<v 2>Yeah,
they'll get upset.
Dude,
I,
I've seen,
I've seen parts of this business that,</v>

874
00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:45.740
that I know you've seen
but I've seen it differently.

875
00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:51.290
Like,
like I've seen parts of this business where people are,
dude I like,

876
00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:54.820
I wish I could say names where they asked for more money or they went to do with

877
00:52:54.821 --> 00:52:57.950
theater tour and then I've heard the conversation,
they're not selling tickets.

878
00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:00.020
They fucking,
you know what?
That's what you get.

879
00:53:00.021 --> 00:53:01.400
You think you're too much in this business.

880
00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:03.860
And I always felt like if you come at it humble,
like I'm a worker,

881
00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:07.220
a lunch pail guy,
do book me and all your fucking,
I'll do everything.

882
00:53:07.221 --> 00:53:10.970
I'll do everything that that was the way to getting money.
I look at Joey,

883
00:53:10.971 --> 00:53:13.310
Joey moves identical tickets to me.

884
00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:16.920
I mean we're Joey's selling out every show he does you mean?
Yeah.
Joey.

885
00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:18.230
Joey's does everything.

886
00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:22.760
Ari does identical if not much bigger than me after.

887
00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:24.620
That's what he just doesn't know because he hasn't been on the road,

888
00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:26.970
but they say no all the fucking time.

889
00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:30.540
<v 5>Yeah.
Cause here's what Julia and also to Joey's credit,</v>

890
00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:32.560
he was saying no before he sold a lot of tech.

891
00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:36.390
I was going to say that is that Joey Diaz was saying no when he was at a

892
00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:41.500
whatever lower rung on the totem pole because it's a habit of I'm important.

893
00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:45.060
What's important to me is important and I'm not going to let these boundaries

894
00:53:45.061 --> 00:53:48.580
get moved by the agent's pressuring a will if you don't do that.
Okay,

895
00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:52.500
well we will let it happen down Sunday show.
Yeah.
Oh.

896
00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:55.960
<v 2>Oh.
He's the reason I stopped doing so many shows.
How about this analogy?</v>

897
00:53:56.110 --> 00:53:58.510
Can I tell you this is,
I was thinking about this today cause I was like,

898
00:53:58.511 --> 00:54:01.030
I'm sure we'll talk about because all the things that I talked to you about

899
00:54:01.031 --> 00:54:03.940
privately are always open game and I know I talked to you about,

900
00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:07.960
you mean you always talk about I'm working too hard that I'm working myself into

901
00:54:07.961 --> 00:54:11.050
a grave.
Here's,
can I tell you the feeling I had,

902
00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:15.990
I was thinking of this analogy today at your age.
I stopped,
I,

903
00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:16.873
I,
I,

904
00:54:17.290 --> 00:54:22.090
I left the playground and I went to go in for a play date with travel channel.

905
00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:26.020
I went in to seem nice.
Was inside,
was indoors,
had x boxes.

906
00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:27.101
I was like this would be nice.

907
00:54:27.101 --> 00:54:29.890
I wouldn't mind if they sent me over to this forever and I could turn this into

908
00:54:29.891 --> 00:54:31.810
what?
I could just do that.
That'd be really fun.

909
00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:36.430
And then I came out in the sun setting and they built a fucking bad ass play

910
00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:39.550
structure for you guys and stand up and I saw you on it.
You're like,
Bert,

911
00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:41.890
come on.
You should have been doing this the whole time.

912
00:54:41.891 --> 00:54:44.680
What the fuck were you inside?
And I'm like,
oh my God.
And Joey's like,
dog,

913
00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:46.750
I only want to do the monkey rings and always like,

914
00:54:46.751 --> 00:54:48.550
I'm going to play for a second and then I'm gonna go on a bike ride.

915
00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:52.300
And then I'm like,
hold on.
I get to fucking play on those as long as I want.

916
00:54:52.301 --> 00:54:56.290
And I feel like,
I feel like my mom's yelling going to come inside and I'm like,

917
00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:59.890
I just got out here.
I didn't know that the light,
the lamps were coming on.

918
00:54:59.891 --> 00:55:00.810
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah.

919
00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:05.290
Like a standup blossomed in a way that had I not done travel channel,

920
00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:08.860
who knows?
But now that I'm out of travel channel,
I go,
oh,

921
00:55:08.861 --> 00:55:12.430
this is fucking amazing.
When you see how many tickets John Malaney is moving,

922
00:55:12.431 --> 00:55:16.540
you're like,
oh,
like it's like you're just overwhelmed.
It's crazy.
I mean,

923
00:55:17.050 --> 00:55:20.910
Jim Jefferies moving 3000 tickets in a night.
Like,
I don't,

924
00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:23.800
I'm not comparing myself with them,
but I'm saying,
by the way,
what I'm saying,

925
00:55:23.801 --> 00:55:26.380
for those of you that dark don't understand what I'm saying is they're not doing

926
00:55:26.381 --> 00:55:29.820
the clubs right now.
So the clubs still need to fill it with people.
Right.

927
00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:32.290
So that's where I come in and,
and Joey and Ari,
I'm saying,

928
00:55:32.291 --> 00:55:33.250
I'm not saying that I'm not,

929
00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:36.990
I'm not trying to put us exactly in the same situation,
but,
and now there's,

930
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.710
and now that the German ladies moving 100,000 tickets in Chicago,

931
00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:44.230
there's a 1200 seat theater that's empty.
Right?
Right.

932
00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:47.260
And me and him don't have a crossover and fans.
So there's a theater going,

933
00:55:47.261 --> 00:55:49.420
we need to book people and that'll be me next year.

934
00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:52.270
So like I feel like that's why I feel like

935
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:54.180
<v 5>feel like I'm on the playground.
That Burke,
can I tell you,</v>

936
00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:56.580
just having known you for the last like decade or whatever,

937
00:55:56.830 --> 00:55:59.290
is that this over work ethic?
I feel like it's,

938
00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:02.080
it's been at every level of your career.
Like where you are,

939
00:56:02.110 --> 00:56:04.700
you are featuring a hundred,
you are a hundred.

940
00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:06.940
So when is it ever gonna fuck with me?

941
00:56:06.941 --> 00:56:11.320
You gotta start to draw some mother fucking boundaries.
Now you're successful.

942
00:56:11.321 --> 00:56:15.880
Now you've got the ticket sales,
now you've got the power to go,
hey man,

943
00:56:15.881 --> 00:56:20.200
I'm not doing fucking five shows.
Fuck your Sunday.
You're there bro.
I don't,

944
00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:22.910
<v 2>I don't know if I'll ever have what you guys have.</v>

945
00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:27.670
I know which is which is,
uh,
I'm getting,
I'm done.

946
00:56:27.671 --> 00:56:29.560
My show,
I'm going back to my room.

947
00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:34.370
<v 5>That's the essence of the whole fucking thing.
I,
I the overworking cause you</v>

948
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:38.000
<v 2>no,
no,
maybe I feel like it makes me feel accomplished a right.</v>

949
00:56:38.010 --> 00:56:41.760
I don't have to think for working.
The overbooking oversee the workaholism.

950
00:56:41.790 --> 00:56:43.410
It's like alcoholic.
Leann.

951
00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:46.020
Leann will fold laundry if she's got nothing else to do.

952
00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:49.860
And I go just to relax and she's like,
what?
I gotta do something.
I love land.

953
00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:54.670
But like my,
my meet and greets are like an hour plus.
Oh my God.
But,

954
00:56:54.671 --> 00:56:59.190
but I know,
I always tell Tom,
I wish meeting people,
I wish.

955
00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:01.070
Do you remember the f you're the first time you did the,

956
00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:05.280
you did the date and funny bone and you were like,
hey man,
uh,
they uh,

957
00:57:05.281 --> 00:57:07.350
they really like it here and I was like,
oh,
it's a fun group.

958
00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:11.440
Whose House did you go to?
And you're like,
Huh?
And you were like,

959
00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:14.610
you're like,
yeah,
you go out with these people.
And I was like,

960
00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:17.460
every night I grew up with staff,
every single night I go to the,

961
00:57:17.461 --> 00:57:20.340
we throw a house party on Sunday nights that we all go there cause we get off

962
00:57:20.341 --> 00:57:24.000
early and Tom's like,
hold on,
you go out with the staff,
the crew every night.

963
00:57:24.001 --> 00:57:25.890
And I know,
I was like,
yeah,
that was turned into the fans.

964
00:57:25.891 --> 00:57:29.880
I mean I do shows and they'll,
I'll go,
hey guys,
meet me at this bar.
We did the,

965
00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:32.900
we did the,
the Wilbur Wright in January

966
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.640
<v 5>saying I'm exhausted.
No,
that's what I'm saying.
Like I just,
it's so crazy.</v>

967
00:57:36.641 --> 00:57:41.130
You sleep like how much do you sleep?
Four hours on the road.
No,
no,

968
00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.560
no.
That's the time to sleep when you're in these hotels.

969
00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:47.520
What about like when you're home,
what we'll do you sleep?
How do you sleep?

970
00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:50.250
I sleep pretty good at home.
How long,
what are we talking?

971
00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:54.910
<v 2>Um,
last night?
Probably seven hours.
Okay.
Yeah,</v>

972
00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:56.530
probably average around seven hours.

973
00:57:56.770 --> 00:58:01.250
<v 5>Well,
what happened Bart,
if you didn't schedule anything,</v>

974
00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:02.113
what would happen?

975
00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:04.050
<v 2>What would happen if I,
if I had stand up,</v>

976
00:58:04.051 --> 00:58:06.440
be my side bitch and I tried to focus on,
I'm just saying,

977
00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:08.040
let's just say it's this week.

978
00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:11.160
I can't even wrap my head around what you're saying because I'm going,

979
00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:13.530
are you telling me if I did less standup and I focus on another project,

980
00:58:13.770 --> 00:58:15.080
but I can't imagine doing that.

981
00:58:15.310 --> 00:58:17.320
<v 5>Just be,
can you just be for fucking,</v>

982
00:58:17.321 --> 00:58:20.080
you know what I want you to do this years though,
been the fucking challenge.

983
00:58:20.081 --> 00:58:24.640
Listen,
he's got anxiety.
Here's the fucking challenge I wish Joe Rogan would,

984
00:58:24.641 --> 00:58:27.160
would've put to you guys.
You go to an Ashram,

985
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:31.600
you guys go on a fucking silent retreat,
a silent retreat,

986
00:58:31.830 --> 00:58:34.540
good for seven days.
None of you assholes talk.

987
00:58:34.570 --> 00:58:36.880
You fucking meditate and you get any of your head.

988
00:58:36.881 --> 00:58:40.780
And it's sobriety and it's vegetarian meals and it's quiet.

989
00:58:40.781 --> 00:58:45.130
And what would happen?
Oh,
I would lose my fucking mind,
man.

990
00:58:45.131 --> 00:58:47.350
I got a text.
Gender.
I know.
I wonder if what would happen.

991
00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:52.450
I would lose my fucking mind.
I signed up for TM classes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Great.

992
00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:56.050
Do you know how many did you go to sign up for a TM classes?
Flight lessons.

993
00:58:58.030 --> 00:59:01.420
Flight lessons?
Yup.
Yup.
Okay.
All right.
What are you doing?

994
00:59:01.450 --> 00:59:03.910
I'm officially not texting back forth.

995
00:59:03.911 --> 00:59:05.650
We bill trying to find the right flight school.

996
00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:08.880
Are you going to do a helicopter or plane doing a flip fix?

997
00:59:09.310 --> 00:59:12.670
Just a plain single engine plane.
Stop.
It leans right.
Stop doing stuff.

998
00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:17.350
It's three hours.
What do you want?
Do it with me.
I've done it.
Did you really?

999
00:59:17.590 --> 00:59:20.920
Oh my God.
And assessed now.
Like a single?
Yeah.
Did you have your license?
No,

1000
00:59:20.921 --> 00:59:21.754
I tried

1001
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:23.450
<v 0>dude.
Like this.</v>

1002
00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:28.030
The Fun police stopped my joy of,
it's like all I want

1003
00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:30.040
<v 2>our first child,
our new barley.</v>

1004
00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:33.830
I was really upset about the flight school thing cause I was like,
oh children.

1005
00:59:34.090 --> 00:59:34.601
Yeah,
but no,

1006
00:59:34.601 --> 00:59:39.010
but I thought it would help me get over my fear of flying if I could fly.

1007
00:59:39.550 --> 00:59:42.340
And then I was like,
I'm not getting in a plane with you.
I was like,
oh,

1008
00:59:42.341 --> 00:59:44.890
by the way,
you're definitely getting complaint with me.
That's how that works.

1009
00:59:44.891 --> 00:59:46.900
That's why I'm taking flight lessons.
It's going to press.
Are you,

1010
00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:51.490
so I've got a lot of things.
I'm building a fence.
No.
Oh,

1011
00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:55.720
the pool is the pool anyway.
They just filled in all the trenches for the pipes.

1012
00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:58.810
Yeah.
I've been excited for it.
I'm so fucking excited.

1013
00:59:58.950 --> 01:00:01.530
<v 0>So like,
uh,
it's in a way,
and I don't mean this in a,</v>

1014
01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:06.480
in a way that sounds like the less than positive,

1015
01:00:06.481 --> 01:00:09.900
but like it's like a trophy.
It's an accomplishment to have that pool.
Right?

1016
01:00:09.930 --> 01:00:14.010
Don't you feel like it's like,
dude,
it's like a mark of all the work.

1017
01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:19.130
<v 2>Uh,
yeah,
there's uh,
there's a lot.</v>

1018
01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:20.440
I don't,

1019
01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:25.220
I'm not like I wanted a pool forever cause I think they really prefer,

1020
01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:28.550
I think growing up in Florida you get home and it just makes you relax and plus

1021
01:00:28.551 --> 01:00:30.920
that it pulls her so common.
But like I,
you know,
I think this,

1022
01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:33.620
I think what's happening is,
you're right,
I am overscheduling myself.

1023
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:37.040
I literally was like a on this impractical jokers cruise.

1024
01:00:37.041 --> 01:00:39.710
I want to go scuba diving and then I'm like,
wait,
what am I doing?

1025
01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:44.030
I'm gonna bring my scuba gear on this course.
But I,
I,

1026
01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:47.840
I don't know.
I don't know.
Push,
I think you hit it on the head.

1027
01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:53.270
I would even when we were texting and I said last night about going to yoga and

1028
01:00:53.271 --> 01:00:55.040
we were going to go out to Jo Jo,

1029
01:00:55.041 --> 01:00:58.190
like directed directly I think probably more at me,
but he was like,
hey,

1030
01:00:58.191 --> 01:01:00.960
this is like a serious class.
No fucking round.
Cause I think,

1031
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:05.240
I think definitely I'd be like,
you know,
I mean we'll see tonight,

1032
01:01:06.070 --> 01:01:08.270
but I take yoga pretty seriously.
But like,

1033
01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:12.730
<v 0>no,
this is a,
a very,
um,
like I pretty well documented thing.</v>

1034
01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:17.560
We should tell a listening or viewing audience that what's really what's going

1035
01:01:17.561 --> 01:01:20.440
on is for the month of October,

1036
01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:25.000
we are bird myself.
Ari are completely sober.
Yeah.

1037
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:28.630
Joe is no booze and told us to go fuck ourselves.

1038
01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:33.270
And then we're supposed to do 15 ari lights him up on his bond.

1039
01:01:34.330 --> 01:01:39.250
1590 minute yoga classes,
a hot yoga classes.

1040
01:01:39.251 --> 01:01:43.300
So Bikram Yoga.
Yeah.
And um,
I mean,

1041
01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:46.510
Joe's class gave me anxiety.
One thing.
This is a little different.
I mean,

1042
01:01:46.511 --> 01:01:48.220
that I felt like was,
I dunno,

1043
01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:52.300
it's still a thing as far as this challenge is like,
you know,

1044
01:01:52.301 --> 01:01:55.930
the weight loss challenge was,
was stakes.
The stakes were like,
you know,

1045
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:59.440
you're going to get shamed for being the loser.
You're going to,
you're going to,

1046
01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:04.540
someone's going to shave your beard.
Yeah.
And,
um,
and you're supposed to,
you know,

1047
01:02:04.541 --> 01:02:07.310
take the other person on a trip or someone was gonna pay for a trip.
So like,

1048
01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:10.390
there's these stakes.
This one's a little more like,
a little more broad,

1049
01:02:10.530 --> 01:02:12.220
a little broad.
It's still pot.
Like,

1050
01:02:12.221 --> 01:02:16.180
the worst thing that happens is like you're sober and you're more in shape.

1051
01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:16.670
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1052
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:21.450
I think it's fluid in that in that if we decide mid month that we realize what

1053
01:02:21.451 --> 01:02:22.440
the state should be,

1054
01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:26.660
I mean are is really are he really wants to do a decathlon and find out.

1055
01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:28.910
<v 0>I totally get that.</v>

1056
01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:33.740
The one thing about like I tried to emphasize was like you don't want to

1057
01:02:33.741 --> 01:02:38.741
announce that when like like we're going to do the decathlon this day.

1058
01:02:39.741 --> 01:02:42.500
Like when you don't have a location you'd have it locked down.

1059
01:02:42.501 --> 01:02:46.640
Like you're just gonna end up in raging people who would want to go the website.

1060
01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:47.541
<v 2>The one crazy thing,</v>

1061
01:02:47.541 --> 01:02:52.541
and I don't know if this is the byproduct or that that Joe enjoyed or that I

1062
01:02:52.911 --> 01:02:54.200
enjoyed or that you enjoyed.

1063
01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:57.680
I don't think Ari really got a biproduct side of that first challenge was I,

1064
01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:01.280
I really will say a lot of people came up to me and said,
dude,

1065
01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:02.990
me and my buddies also a hundred pounds.

1066
01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:07.060
<v 0>Yeah.
Now a lot are saying that they're going to join us.
Dude,</v>

1067
01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:11.410
<v 2>it is aggressive.
It's much more than the fat challenge.
Yeah,
it is.</v>

1068
01:03:11.411 --> 01:03:13.030
Sober October is been,

1069
01:03:13.330 --> 01:03:16.750
has gotten huge and I think mostly because Joe wouldn't quit smoking weed.

1070
01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:21.910
Then it got a job.
It got much bigger cause everyone's like,
everyone's like,

1071
01:03:21.911 --> 01:03:24.840
all right,
fuck it,
I'll do it.
I'm in with the bird and the,
the,

1072
01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:28.630
the common thing I get at every meet and greet,
or at least the one that didn't,

1073
01:03:28.631 --> 01:03:31.390
DC was the most recent one and in Australia,

1074
01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:33.880
all the meet and greets I did in Australia,
those were fucking aggressive.

1075
01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:37.360
I'm going to talk a bit about a misstep of boundaries.
Hey guys,

1076
01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:38.820
I'm at the fucking Sheridan.

1077
01:03:38.830 --> 01:03:43.830
I'll see you there in sane and everybody would go,

1078
01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:48.790
oh,
is a thousand seat theater.
I didn't realize how big that would be.

1079
01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:53.710
We overran our bar of like,
I was at the Sofitel.
I was like,

1080
01:03:53.711 --> 01:03:56.290
I'm at the Sofitel.
It was in Brisbane.
I'll see you guys there.

1081
01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:01.150
Fucking like to the point where it,
a couple times I got scared.

1082
01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:05.170
<v 0>I would go crazy if somebody had done that to me.
The first thing I would do,</v>

1083
01:04:05.171 --> 01:04:07.420
I would,
I would tell the tour guy,
I'd be like,
go into my room,

1084
01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:10.750
empty the fucking packed my bags and we're getting in a car and we're going to

1085
01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:13.840
do another hotel in the Hilton.
Oh,
right.
Fucking now I'm the one that told them.

1086
01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:17.830
I know what I'm saying.
Like if some,
if somebody had done outed my,
I'd be like,

1087
01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:20.110
we're fucking moving hotels.
Yeah,

1088
01:04:20.550 --> 01:04:25.110
<v 2>I'd fly home.
I wish I had that.
I wish I had that in me.
I like that though.</v>

1089
01:04:25.170 --> 01:04:27.990
I liked that.
What part of that do you like?
Can I tell you?

1090
01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:33.830
This is a flip part's fun of that I strangers who you don't and not that they're

1091
01:04:33.991 --> 01:04:36.690
all bad,
like our audience is actually very cool people,

1092
01:04:36.691 --> 01:04:40.650
but it's a thousand of them at your hotel.
Are there,
is there,

1093
01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:43.350
what's the fun of it?
Told the bartender,
I said,

1094
01:04:43.351 --> 01:04:46.950
do you mind if I invite some friends back after the show?
And he was like,
yeah.

1095
01:04:46.951 --> 01:04:49.650
He said,
well,
you guys stay up until two.
He was like,
yeah.
I said,

1096
01:04:49.651 --> 01:04:53.040
it's like he's like 22 many.
He's like,
Oh,
you can bring everyone.
And I was like,

1097
01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:57.810
okay.
So I just announced it on stage and I was like,
he was they,

1098
01:04:57.811 --> 01:05:01.800
and they don't work for tips there.
So he was just overwhelmed.
But he loved it.

1099
01:05:01.801 --> 01:05:04.020
They loved the idea that they're moving that much booze and we drank them out of

1100
01:05:04.021 --> 01:05:06.850
everything.
And uh,
but what I like about it and I,

1101
01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:10.170
and then this might be shortsighted,
but like in college,

1102
01:05:10.171 --> 01:05:11.570
when you saw a band performed,

1103
01:05:11.571 --> 01:05:14.670
did you want to talk to that lead singer or were you like give them space

1104
01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:18.870
because the space yeah.
To know your heroes?
No,
no.
Oh,

1105
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.900
I had a burning the first time I ever saw Dave [inaudible],

1106
01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:27.730
Dave Chappelle perform.
Yeah.
I didn't know who he was.
I know he's a good comic.

1107
01:05:27.731 --> 01:05:31.180
I didn't know he was like accomplished.
I was 26 I was 25 years old,

1108
01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.250
just moved to New York.
And I,

1109
01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:38.290
I must've given him an ear beating about how funny he was.
By the way.

1110
01:05:38.291 --> 01:05:41.080
He's already a millionaire at the time.
I was like,
dude,

1111
01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:45.610
you need to stick with this.
You are absolutely hilarious.
You are fucking like,

1112
01:05:45.790 --> 01:05:49.300
I can't tell you.
And by the way,
he's probably 21 at the time,

1113
01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:53.530
or maybe he was 25 to be closer was 25 he was so kind.

1114
01:05:54.010 --> 01:05:57.580
He was so kind.
And he was like,
thanks.
And he was like generous.

1115
01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:01.210
And then he walked away and,
and I think to meet you,
Martin said,

1116
01:06:01.211 --> 01:06:02.770
what are you talking to Dave Chappelle about?
And I was like,

1117
01:06:03.010 --> 01:06:06.130
who's Dave Chappelle?
He's like,
that guy.
I said,
oh,
I don't,

1118
01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:08.650
I was just telling him you should stick with,
and he's really a great comic.

1119
01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:11.770
And he's like,
dude,
he's fucking famous.
I went,
what?
He's like,

1120
01:06:11.771 --> 01:06:15.880
he's got a movie coming out called how high or whatever.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi me half baked.

1121
01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:20.140
And he's like,
he was in Robin Hood men in tights.
I go,
Oh shit.
That's the guy.

1122
01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:21.940
Yeah.
And I was like,
oh my God.

1123
01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:25.630
But the fact that he was that fucking cool do never left me.

1124
01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:30.720
The fact that ship that a tell when George was born took me out partying like I

1125
01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:33.010
never lost on me.

1126
01:06:33.011 --> 01:06:35.800
And the fact that we walked into a bar and when a tell walked in,

1127
01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:39.760
the place went nuts and they were all over him.
I was like,

1128
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.710
that blew me away beyond like,
I mean,

1129
01:06:44.711 --> 01:06:48.250
I loved his material,
but that connection he had with them,
I was like,
dude,

1130
01:06:48.251 --> 01:06:51.820
give me that one time,
that party guy kind of thing though.
No,
no.

1131
01:06:51.821 --> 01:06:55.330
It's just a generous person.
Like a guy who's like,
I'm willing to,

1132
01:06:55.570 --> 01:06:59.740
I'm not any different than you.
I'm just,
I'm a fan of comms.
I'm a fan of bushes.

1133
01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:03.430
I'm a fan of Ari's.
I'm a fan of Joey's.
I'm a fan of Joe's.
I'm a fan of,
of,

1134
01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:06.670
of Jo Jo Koy fleet past bars.
I'm a fan.
All of these people too.

1135
01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:10.530
I listen to all the podcasts too.
If you want to talk,
let's talk.
Yeah.

1136
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:15.010
And I think,
I think maybe I'd started that and maybe I,

1137
01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:18.700
maybe I've gotten it now.
Maybe I should get away from that a tad bit.
But yeah,

1138
01:07:18.730 --> 01:07:22.870
like,
I mean,
I don't shut people down or not talk to people,
you know.
Uh,

1139
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:26.590
I met a guy,
I met a guy,
this is one of my favorite stories ever.

1140
01:07:26.890 --> 01:07:30.940
I met a guy sitting next to me at lunch and he goes,
uh,

1141
01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:34.360
the machine sitting right next to me.
I go,
hey man,
what's up?
I mean by myself.

1142
01:07:34.361 --> 01:07:37.990
Where are you?
I have no idea.
It had to be very,
some are very recent.
Okay.

1143
01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:41.410
Cause this is a very round the road.
I'm on the road machine.
And I was like,

1144
01:07:41.411 --> 01:07:44.890
what's up man?
He was like,
uh,
he's like nothing man.
I gotta tell you I love,

1145
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:48.910
I love your podcast.
I listen to all you guys.
I was like,
oh,
cool.
And he's like,

1146
01:07:48.970 --> 01:07:51.130
what are you doing here?
And I said,
Oh,
I'm doing this,
whatever.

1147
01:07:51.131 --> 01:07:55.690
I'm doing the club.
He's like,
uh,
oh that's great.
Uh,
what are you doing at night?

1148
01:07:55.691 --> 01:07:58.990
And I was,
suites are bullshitting or food gums.
We still keep,

1149
01:07:58.991 --> 01:08:02.050
we're sitting like almost next to each other,
but look close.
We talked,

1150
01:08:02.051 --> 01:08:04.540
we just keep talking and he gets up.
He's like,
hey man,

1151
01:08:06.490 --> 01:08:09.550
I got to say I,
it might've been in La,
it might've been an la.
He goes,

1152
01:08:09.551 --> 01:08:13.190
I gotta say cause I,
but they was in la.
He goes,
I gotta say,
uh,

1153
01:08:13.210 --> 01:08:16.010
you're really fucking cool.
I was like,
I appreciate it man.
And he's like,
I met

1154
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:20.630
Tommy the other day.
He goes,
I said,
Tom,

1155
01:08:20.631 --> 01:08:22.730
it's Tom would,
hey,
I'm going to eat dinner.

1156
01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:27.200
I'm trying to get this dinner or whatever.
You were like,
Hey,
you are,
you're nice.

1157
01:08:27.201 --> 01:08:29.570
You're like,
hey,
how you doing?
And he's like telling me I'm,
and you're like,
Eh,

1158
01:08:29.810 --> 01:08:33.470
I'm going to eat dinner.
And I was like,
in my head,
I was like,

1159
01:08:33.471 --> 01:08:37.850
I wish I could fucking do that.
I can't believe you would the same guy,
same guy.

1160
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.300
That guy's definitely listen to this.
He was dead.
I don't know where I was.

1161
01:08:41.330 --> 01:08:46.190
I want to say I was in la only because I might even done with the girls or

1162
01:08:46.191 --> 01:08:46.850
something.

1163
01:08:46.850 --> 01:08:47.683
<v 4>Hmm.</v>

1164
01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:52.700
I did meet a guy like the day after we all were on Joe's.

1165
01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:56.820
Yeah.
And,
and he said he was at the table next to me.
He was like,
Whoa,

1166
01:08:56.910 --> 01:09:01.440
because I've just listened.
Yeah.
And uh,
he goes like,

1167
01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:05.280
Holy Shit.
He goes,
I'm just listening to it like a five minutes ago.

1168
01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:06.420
And I was like,
oh,
that's cool man,

1169
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:10.470
<v 2>but be done automatically.
I,
my,
my story is different.
If someone says that,
I go,</v>

1170
01:09:10.471 --> 01:09:15.300
you gotta be fucking kidding me.
Let me see.
Like I can,
I go,
yeah,

1171
01:09:15.301 --> 01:09:16.134
that's cool.

1172
01:09:16.930 --> 01:09:20.140
<v 4>Goes,
ah.
He goes,
I don't even know what to say right now.
And I go,</v>

1173
01:09:20.230 --> 01:09:21.820
I'm going to order some food.
So yeah.

1174
01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:25.890
<v 2>Okay.
Where were you at?
A Sushi restaurant.
W uh,</v>

1175
01:09:25.891 --> 01:09:29.470
where in the area and this area.
Oh No,

1176
01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:31.510
it wasn't the same one that is,
that is the story.

1177
01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:34.350
I'm about to order some food or something.
It's just very casual.
Not a dick,

1178
01:09:34.351 --> 01:09:36.780
but like,
yeah,
like,
yeah,
this conversation conversation's over.

1179
01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:38.480
But the difference between

1180
01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:42.940
<v 4>between what Tom does,
which is like,
Hey,
I'm,
I'm nice,
I'm nice to people too.</v>

1181
01:09:42.941 --> 01:09:46.120
And I actually,
I've gotten a nice conversations with fans.
Absolutely.

1182
01:09:46.150 --> 01:09:49.110
But then there's also a kind of thing where you go like,
all right,

1183
01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.170
I think I should go home.

1184
01:09:50.171 --> 01:09:53.740
And just like keep my space and then kind of have my time.
Yeah.

1185
01:09:53.830 --> 01:09:56.680
And let them have their night and then I have my night.
Right.

1186
01:09:56.830 --> 01:09:59.770
But I'm respectful and I try to be kind to people because it means a lot

1187
01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:02.870
to people,
man.
I'm not,

1188
01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:06.700
but I don't want them in my hotel lobby a thousand of them.
No,

1189
01:10:06.701 --> 01:10:08.770
that's the totally different thing there.
Yeah.

1190
01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:12.530
<v 2>Do you,
uh,
when you,
when you're in an airplane and people are falling on,
yeah.</v>

1191
01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:15.590
Do you feel guilty that they didn't get enough time with you?
When they say,

1192
01:10:15.591 --> 01:10:18.820
Hi Mike?
Oh my God,

1193
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:20.640
what's the craziest stuff?

1194
01:10:23.690 --> 01:10:27.350
Yesterday people were boarding it.
Oh my God.
This guy was like,
oh shit,

1195
01:10:27.351 --> 01:10:29.330
the machine.
I was like,
what's up man?
He's like,
dude,
I was just,

1196
01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:31.970
but the line's moving.
And I was like,
oh,
I want him to finish his story.

1197
01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:34.940
But I like,
I'm not,
I'm not emotionally involved in it.
Yeah.

1198
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:37.470
So it was just listening or are you good?
Oh,
let's just talk.
Oh,

1199
01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:41.460
I can talk to them.
No,
but I wouldn't put it past boundaries.

1200
01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:44.270
I don't have boundaries.
I do not have one,
so.
Right.

1201
01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:47.180
I'm telling you I know boundaries,
but you do have cool banks.

1202
01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:52.040
That's what I just noticed.
Right?
Yeah,
that's better.

1203
01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:56.120
Oh,
um,
oh,
you left your spray can of stuff here.

1204
01:10:56.121 --> 01:11:00.830
Last time you were in sprinkle hair.
Yeah,
yeah.

1205
01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:04.700
Oh,
Rogaine.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh for real.
Oh fuck.
Thank you.

1206
01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:08.750
I probably left it for you cause I have a perfect hair.

1207
01:11:10.730 --> 01:11:14.040
Um,
yeah,
I,
I think you said push.

1208
01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:15.270
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1209
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:16.103
<v 2>Is,
uh,</v>

1210
01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:19.500
like I'm excited about doing podcasts with like insightful people this month

1211
01:11:19.970 --> 01:11:23.980
because we're,
we're doing one in a couple of weeks we'll come out,
but um,

1212
01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:25.670
<v 6>okay.</v>

1213
01:11:25.670 --> 01:11:27.530
<v 2>But yeah,
I have,
I have,</v>

1214
01:11:27.610 --> 01:11:30.250
<v 6>I should,
I should change</v>

1215
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:34.010
<v 2>my lifestyle and the way I work and I think that will change my lifestyle and</v>

1216
01:11:34.011 --> 01:11:38.870
the way I,
I be healthy.
Like if I would,
if I was home for a week,
like there's,

1217
01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:43.310
there's no booby unsolvable and you'd be so good.
We'll,
we'll talk about this,

1218
01:11:43.311 --> 01:11:47.990
I think a later Burt on your podcast.
I want to get deeper down this rabbit hole,

1219
01:11:47.991 --> 01:11:50.450
but look,
you know,
can we do it?
Would you rather,

1220
01:11:50.451 --> 01:11:55.070
I kind of feel like I want to do the one we did for Ari with a bird.

1221
01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:58.070
I'm just curious of what it is.
Let me,
let me see if I can pull up this name.

1222
01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:13.430
<v 7>Where are you?
How do you find these fears?</v>

1223
01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:16.830
You realize what's happening here,

1224
01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:20.303
Andy.

1225
01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:39.570
<v 2>This is unsolicited.
Somebody just made me pay given in India.</v>

1226
01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:42.360
I tell you how frustrating that is.
If I got this,

1227
01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:45.720
that person would have my phone number and my address and that's the

1228
01:12:45.721 --> 01:12:48.930
relationship I'd have with that fan.
I'd be like,
dude,
I really owe you.
Yeah,

1229
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:53.920
well call me whatever.
No,
I wish.
I have no fucking fans.

1230
01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:56.770
Talk to Leanne about your boundaries.
There's some,
oh,

1231

<v 2>People just made these men like dozens and thousands were all over the world is</v>

1242
01:13:56.830 --> 01:14:00.030

Isn't that crazy?
Awesome.

1243
01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:06.750
<v 8>Oh guys,

One more time.
He's fat.

1245
01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:18.820
He's got a picture of me up in his classroom.
He's fast.

1246
01:14:20.050 --> 01:14:22.870
He's fat.
Okay.

1247
01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:28.760
<v 2>I mean these,
these came in literally by the dozens men from all over the way.</v>

1248
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:33.150
The best one ever is that fucking pig dude who,

1249
01:14:33.230 --> 01:14:36.330
who won the eating contest.
That was great.

1250
01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:40.580
<v 9>Not just a competitor,
but the favorite to win the dog.
This guy.</v>

1251
01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:44.380
It's the most you can eat in five minutes.
So Richard,
I,
how often do you,

1252
01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:49.120
oh my God,
I know my,
you know,
my parents might fool you.
I'm,

1253
01:14:49.121 --> 01:14:53.130
I'm on.
Been on a giant diet and life changing stuff.
Um,

1254
01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:55.910
I've dropped about a hundred pounds in eight months.
Awesome.

1255
01:14:55.970 --> 01:15:00.680
So we're going to consider this my cheat day for the here,
but you know,

1256
01:15:00.681 --> 01:15:04.490
prepping gallons of water.
But you know,
I have two giant inspirations.

1257
01:15:04.491 --> 01:15:08.660
I'm first my wife,
second anniversary,
I want to say hi to her.

1258
01:15:09.170 --> 01:15:13.670
And um,
there's a comedian I love,
he's a big giant fat guy,
just like me,

1259
01:15:13.671 --> 01:15:15.770
Bert Chrysler.
And uh,
you know,

1260
01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:19.060
<v 2>if the guy just starts giggling a little,
you still way bigger than I am.</v>

1261
01:15:19.061 --> 01:15:21.880
But you know what inspired him?
There you go.

1262
01:15:21.881 --> 01:15:25.990
Actually saw him recently where he lost uh,
uh,
one of somewhere.

1263
01:15:25.991 --> 01:15:29.500
I don't remember somewhere that I was recently.
Uh,
he gave me,

1264
01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:32.590
gave me like a Jersey from one of the,
cause like one of those contests,

1265
01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:37.480
he lost it.
Oh,
a bunch more weight.
Really?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
But he um,

1266
01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:41.740
yeah,
there there's is,
I'm a,
I'm blown away by that.
I get nothing from fence.

1267
01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:45.250
Really?
No,
I don't like,
I mean,
well maybe I do,
but I just don't,

1268
01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:49.150
I don't have like an email box that I look in.
Maybe that's the problem.

1269
01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:51.310
You need an email.
Yeah.

1270
01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:55.920
<v 1>And then people send it to some other songs.
So many songs.</v>

1271
01:15:56.380 --> 01:15:57.213
Do you have any songs

1272
01:15:59.110 --> 01:16:04.110
from Tom [inaudible] wife is Dina made a Hashtag.

1273
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:07.430
Wiseberg so stop saying that.
I'm fat.

1274
01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:13.450
I got the job,
it just hasn't,

1275
01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.670
and it's been like three weeks.
All I get.

1276
01:16:18.410 --> 01:16:21.360
So tell me

1277
01:16:24.730 --> 01:16:28.230
like 50 songs,
you know,

1278
01:16:28.231 --> 01:16:29.990
there's people that literally right,
go,

1279
01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:34.580
<v 2>hey man,
you're not that fat of course.
And then I go,
yeah,
no shit.</v>

1280
01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:37.700
And they're like,
I thought it'd be huge.
I was like,
wait,

1281
01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:41.740
are you fucking kidding me?
Yeah.
Some guys,
some guys told me in DC this day,

1282
01:16:42.150 --> 01:16:46.490
the other day,
and he goes,
dude,
you are skinny.
And I was like,
I was like,

1283
01:16:46.491 --> 01:16:47.660
I'm not skinny.
And he goes,
well,

1284
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:52.870
Joe said you're to 65 to 65 I think Joe said you were three 85 at one point.

1285
01:16:53.211 --> 01:16:56.090
And I go,
no,
I'm not to 65 and I go,
it's,
it's,

1286
01:16:56.190 --> 01:16:59.360
and then it starts making you crazy.
You Go,
I go,
you know,

1287
01:16:59.361 --> 01:17:03.560
Tom was fatter than me when this started,
right?
And there were like,
no,
I go,

1288
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:06.950
hold on.
And I was like,
good.
He scrubbed the Internet of pictures of him.

1289
01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:10.300
I know it was,
you know what?
I think I said this back then.

1290
01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:15.020
<v 4>I think some people didn't know.
Some people did not know.</v>

1291
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:18.800
Some people knew that I was fatter than you,

1292
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:23.630
but that they got a thrill out of spreading the misinformation.

1293
01:17:23.631 --> 01:17:26.930
It's like a fake news article.
You're going to start Thomas drunk.
Yeah,

1294
01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:31.880
he was an alcoholic.
Great idea actually.
And then some people were like,

1295
01:17:31.881 --> 01:17:34.460
fuck no birds.
Definitely not as fast

1296
01:17:34.490 --> 01:17:39.230
<v 10>cards,
cards,
cards,
your mom's house</v>

1297
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:44.720
<v 4>the best.
This was the best one.
Uh,
this is my ice.
Listen to this and my car.</v>

1298
01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:47.730
<v 11>This one,
that's my favorite song that's ever been submitted.</v>

1299
01:17:47.731 --> 01:17:51.140
I think it's one of my top five.
This is Ali's easier.
Yeah.

1300
01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:55.530
It's such a joy in your car.
Yeah.

1301
01:17:55.531 --> 01:17:57.750
I love this man that was listening to.
It's good.

1302
01:18:06.650 --> 01:18:09.790
<v 1>It's a real song.
Yeah.</v>

1303
01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:18.720
That's great.
She's fine.

1304
01:18:21.310 --> 01:18:22.143
She's fine.

1305
01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:29.340
She's fine.
She's fine.

1306
01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:31.343
<v 4>Here we go.</v>

1307
01:18:34.150 --> 01:18:35.180
<v 1>I shadowed.</v>

1308
01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:48.600
<v 4>There's just so many songs.
Is it?
Maybe you just have one fan is really busy.</v>

1309
01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:53.610
It's a lot.
It is a lot.
That's fucking insane.
It is.
By the way,

1310
01:18:53.611 --> 01:18:55.260
did you see Steven Seagal is interview?

1311
01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:58.890
We've always roasted him on this show for years,

1312
01:18:58.891 --> 01:19:02.070
but like he did another interview last week.
Did you see his look?

1313
01:19:02.970 --> 01:19:07.680
He looks like Eddie Munster more and more every really crazy it looks painted
on.

1314
01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:08.750
Yeah.

1315
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:11.520
<v 10>Has Your view of Donald Trump and his presidency so far?</v>

1316
01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:17.570
I think that,
you know,
we have a really unfortunate situation in the sense that,

1317
01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:21.640
look at that,
uh,
even though he was democratically elected,
uh,

1318
01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:25.440
there are so many people out there who don't feel that that's the case.

1319
01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:28.870
And we have just,
you know,
uh,
wearing it.

1320
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:32.310
<v 4>Yes.
Always.
Always.
He's wearing a GI.</v>

1321
01:19:32.370 --> 01:19:37.370
He painted his hair jet black Lexus painted his goatee,

1322
01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:42.450
jet black and he got smaller,
tighter villain glasses.

1323
01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:46.050
But I liked the spectacles better than I liked the yellow ones that he had.

1324
01:19:46.051 --> 01:19:47.070
But if you don't like his,
uh,

1325
01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:50.160
his fucking gun range shooting cops shooting glasses.

1326
01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:53.210
Well those made him look fatter and sweaty.
I don't know.

1327
01:19:53.230 --> 01:19:56.790
He's actually tightened up the look.
I prefer the looks fatter now,
by the way.

1328
01:19:56.791 --> 01:20:00.620
I've done this with my hair.
You have,
oh,
when I sprinkled it in one time,
yeah.

1329
01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:05.580
I just,
it went,
went right across and I was like,
everyone sprinkled it in.

1330
01:20:05.610 --> 01:20:07.860
Oh yeah.
I you talking?
Oh

1331
01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:12.390
<v 2>yeah.
I get these,
uh,
this hair filler stuff.
Super Millionaires.
Cool.</v>

1332
01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:13.830
And I used to sprinkle it in for birthday.

1333
01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:14.760
<v 4>I had that.</v>

1334
01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:17.400
That's when I really knew it was one of the Times I knew it was balding was when

1335
01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:21.510
I was in hair and makeup for something.
And the makeup lady who's like,

1336
01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:26.070
you need to put in some hair.
And I go,
well,
I chose yes and it ruined me.

1337
01:20:26.490 --> 01:20:29.880
I go,
what?
She goes,
just fill you in.
I'm going to go,
I don't know.

1338
01:20:30.170 --> 01:20:32.450
I don't even know who you're talking about.
She's like,
oh,
everybody does it.
Yeah,

1339
01:20:32.451 --> 01:20:35.680
I'll do it for you.
Glenn Beck does it.
That was the one that did it to me.
Really?

1340
01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:39.180
What did it look good,
Tommy?
Like,
well,
she didn't go crazy.
I mean,

1341
01:20:39.181 --> 01:20:42.390
she didn't do this if done properly.

1342
01:20:42.391 --> 01:20:45.870
It looks amazing.
Like basically takes the,

1343
01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:48.900
like some of the gaps and the shine out so it just looks more,

1344
01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:51.160
you know what it does?
It attaches

1345
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:52.700
<v 2>to the,
to the hair follicle,</v>

1346
01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:55.950
makes the hair follicle thicker so you don't look like you have a full head of

1347
01:20:55.951 --> 01:20:58.230
hair.
You just,
it just,
it takes the shine out.

1348
01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:01.070
They did meet for the Fox one time and I was like,

1349
01:21:01.071 --> 01:21:04.500
and I came home and my sister was like,
Yo,
you got to buy that shit.

1350
01:21:04.770 --> 01:21:08.520
And then I did it for every travel channel show I ever did because I would see,

1351
01:21:08.521 --> 01:21:11.160
I would,
uh,
I stopped gluten.

1352
01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:15.420
That's how he says he talks with a different acts.
How you say it,
man,
trust me,

1353
01:21:15.421 --> 01:21:20.400
I'm a Russian gluten.
You most Ah,
Ooh,

1354
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.823
the

1355
01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:27.120
lip licking about what's the gimp hand about?

1356
01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:31.860
Uh,
you know,
and uh,
you know,

1357
01:21:32.650 --> 01:21:36.600
letting me uprooting,
uh,
you know,

1358
01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:41.800
<v 4>Eh is
great.
That was great.</v>

1359
01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:42.653
That blue band,

1360
01:21:43.150 --> 01:21:46.000
<v 2>by the way,
I got to tell you,
I got to tell you my Joey Diaz story.</v>

1361
01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:49.210
Tell it please.
So I,
Joey and I talked last night.
He's like,

1362
01:21:49.211 --> 01:21:51.760
don't we go to breakfast?
So we go to this place,

1363
01:21:51.761 --> 01:21:55.810
we eat breakfast almost seven days of it.
And,
uh,
and uh,

1364
01:21:56.680 --> 01:22:01.060
Joey orders three eggs over easy.
Uh,
bacon toast.

1365
01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:05.250
Pretty respectable breakfast.
Yeah.
I just get coffee cause I'm,

1366
01:22:05.590 --> 01:22:09.940
I'm about to go for a run.
Yeah.
And uh,
I'm Wa watch him.

1367
01:22:09.941 --> 01:22:14.050
Have you ever seen him eat eggs?
No.
He uh,
he was very lightly butters,

1368
01:22:14.051 --> 01:22:17.770
his toast and then he goes in with a knife and cuts around the yolks.

1369
01:22:17.771 --> 01:22:22.330
It's sunny side up cuts,
I mean meticulously around the yolks.
And I'm like,

1370
01:22:22.450 --> 01:22:22.890
I'm like,

1371
01:22:22.890 --> 01:22:26.200
oh I guess cause I've done that where you take a couple of the yolks out cause

1372
01:22:26.201 --> 01:22:29.290
you want the egg whites but you don't want the yolks.
And I was like,

1373
01:22:29.291 --> 01:22:31.660
I've done that where you take a couple of egg whites out and you have one,

1374
01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:35.050
but where you get all the egg whites from the other ones that he throws away all

1375
01:22:35.051 --> 01:22:38.530
the egg whites and he goes,
I don't fuck with you.
I got my egg whites dog.

1376
01:22:38.770 --> 01:22:42.970
I just liked the yolks
and I was like,

1377
01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:48.040
that's my favorite part.
That's why I get a eggs.
Um,
uh,
uh,

1378
01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:50.840
<v 4>poached eggs are the best.</v>

1379
01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:58.880
Yes.
Oh,
you music cue.
Of course.
Always have to think this is what we did with Ra,

1380
01:22:58.881 --> 01:23:02.170
but I'm going to modify it even if not.
Um,
yeah.

1381
01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:06.060
Are you nervous about this yoga class?
Ah,
fuck.
Um,

1382
01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:09.380
not really.
Cause I'm not thinking about it too much.

1383
01:23:09.381 --> 01:23:12.200
I think I will be nervous when we're pulling in

1384
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:18.530
parking and I'm walking up.
I might be like,
yeah,
we got to leave soon.

1385
01:23:23.370 --> 01:23:25.160
<v 1>Neil section,
chunk</v>

1386
01:23:28.430 --> 01:23:31.510
the urine homeless men,

1387
01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:37.860
homeless John Sex with your sister.
They gave a face.

1388
01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:41.220
<v 2>Um,
would you rather,
by the way,
do you know Tom Petty died today?</v>

1389
01:23:41.670 --> 01:23:46.560
Isn't that crazy?
Yeah.
66.
That's what I listen to.
The one or the other.

1390
01:23:46.830 --> 01:23:49.680
One of the other things that got me super excited about this challenge as I was

1391
01:23:49.681 --> 01:23:52.290
listening to already languages,
I think turning 50 and he was,

1392
01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:55.530
he had to have a surgery and he's like fifties when it catches up to you.

1393
01:23:55.531 --> 01:23:59.470
And I heard that and I was like,
whew,
cause you're about to have a birthday of,

1394
01:23:59.590 --> 01:24:01.240
I'm going to turn 45 and uh,

1395
01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:05.710
in on November 3rd in on that pay practical jokers crews.
Oh Wow.

1396
01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:09.000
Do you know how many people have told me for years then I looked like already

1397
01:24:09.001 --> 01:24:13.350
Lange everybody.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
Yeah.
For a long time.

1398
01:24:13.351 --> 01:24:16.920
Can I tell you how many people this week?
So we love you Tom.

1399
01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:22.830
What one guy said we love you,
Tom.
On the,
in this audience.
I'm Bert.
Anyone off?

1400
01:24:22.831 --> 01:24:23.664
Same thing.

1401
01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:27.980
<v 4>Oh,
okay.
Are you ready Bart?
Yes.
Okay.</v>

1402
01:24:28.010 --> 01:24:30.380
Would you rather be retarded?

1403
01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:33.920
So you live as a retarded person.
You mean in beauty?

1404
01:24:33.921 --> 01:24:37.490
Keep going or Alzheimer's?

1405
01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:39.973
No.

1406
01:24:40.190 --> 01:24:45.190
Or you get molested by your grandfather on a Ferris wheel as a child.

1407
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:48.620
<v 2>But there's funnel cake after</v>

1408
01:24:51.650 --> 01:24:55.700
grandfather jerks you off on a Ferris wheel or I could do that.

1409
01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:59.060
But he feeds you treats afterwards.
Yeah,
I can do that easily.
Do that.

1410
01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:04.120
Only because,
only because,
only because,
only because,
uh,
like,
like I've,

1411
01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:08.440
we have a family friend who's got a kid with down syndrome.
Yeah.
And uh,

1412
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:11.570
their worry is like their older parents and their worry is what are they,

1413
01:25:11.571 --> 01:25:13.010
what's he gonna do when they pass?

1414
01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:15.600
And I wouldn't want my parents have to worry about me like that.
Yeah.

1415
01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:17.570
That's why only for your,
but the I can get molested.

1416
01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:20.860
I think I might've been molested.
Yeah.
Wait,
what do you mean you don't know?

1417
01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:24.020
You have something there.

1418
01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.980
That night in question where I've gotten a concussion and something happened and

1419
01:25:27.981 --> 01:25:31.970
I was always curious.
How much older was the person?
A much older.
I was 13.

1420
01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:35.600
I don't know,
but I don't know.
I don't know.

1421
01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:39.770
Cause I got a concussion and they were performing medical exams on me and so

1422
01:25:39.771 --> 01:25:41.510
like,
but I was like,
this is the middle of the night.

1423
01:25:41.511 --> 01:25:43.460
Why are we doing one in the middle of the night?
But then I was like,

1424
01:25:43.461 --> 01:25:46.100
I'm not going to ask.
Uh,
I dunno,
but I'm cool with it.
I'm not,

1425
01:25:46.101 --> 01:25:48.620
don't want any problems about it.
You come.
No,
no,
no.
It wasn't bad.

1426
01:25:48.621 --> 01:25:53.060
It was just some fondling,
but it could have been like a testicular exam.
I Dunno.

1427
01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:55.580
I Dunno.
See,
that's my problem is I don't ever think that,

1428
01:25:55.581 --> 01:25:57.410
but I overthink what I'm doing.
And in October,

1429
01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:03.530
<v 4>um,
let's get a couple of big things out of the way.
First a reminder,</v>

1430
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:07.160
<v 0>your special mother inferior comes out October 10th</v>

1431
01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:11.600
<v 5>flick and the trailers up now so you can search for it on Netflix.
Search,</v>

1432
01:26:11.601 --> 01:26:13.610
Christina P,
just the letter p.

1433
01:26:13.611 --> 01:26:17.150
I'm not doing [inaudible] ski on that fucking thing.
And then the title comes up.

1434
01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:21.590
Save it in your studio and then when it comes Danny and watch it.
Yeah.

1435
01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:23.990
<v 2>What did you,
well,
how did you come up with mother inferior?</v>

1436
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:29.230
<v 5>It's a play on mother superior like it,
it's actually based on this artwork.</v>

1437
01:26:29.231 --> 01:26:33.250
A Fan,
uh,
did of me as the Virgin Mary Holding Fifo,
our dog.

1438
01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:34.900
And I sent that to Netflix and I go,

1439
01:26:34.901 --> 01:26:37.840
this is kind of what I'm thinking and it was based on fan art.

1440
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.230
<v 2>Hey guys,
let's do this.
Let's help me name my next special.</v>

1441
01:26:40.231 --> 01:26:43.290
This should be fun with your fans.
Let's help me name my next question.

1442
01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:47.180
You're going to get a lot of Justin.
This is a great idea.
Hey guys,

1443
01:26:47.181 --> 01:26:50.720
I'm shooting at the Trocadero in February.
We're shooting two shows,

1444
01:26:50.721 --> 01:26:52.280
but I'll be there for,
I think I'll be there for four,

1445
01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:56.620
but help me help me named my special.
That's a great idea.
I don't think that,

1446
01:26:56.630 --> 01:27:00.260
I haven't thought of calling it burnt Chrysler and has me on top of a burnt out

1447
01:27:00.261 --> 01:27:04.460
Chrysler.
Yeah.
Like,
like,
like with one arm raised in the sky in a speedo.

1448
01:27:04.490 --> 01:27:08.960
I've definitely thought about that.
That's not bad.
It's not bad.
It's not about,

1449
01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:13.140
it's not a bad way to brace the embrace the charge.
Yeah,
that's true.
I,

1450
01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:17.450
I've definitely gone is because I don't mind when people come to be burnt.

1451
01:27:17.451 --> 01:27:20.660
Chrysler,
it makes me happy cause I go,
oh,
then you know me.
Right.

1452
01:27:20.690 --> 01:27:23.540
Like in a weird way in some of those what's up burnt Chrysler,
I go,
Oh,
I go,

1453
01:27:23.541 --> 01:27:26.030
oh you were,
you know,
me and Tom,
you know Christina and me and Tom,

1454
01:27:26.031 --> 01:27:26.690
we were all friends.

1455
01:27:26.690 --> 01:27:29.270
<v 0>So do you know what happened?
Uh,
when I,
I,</v>

1456
01:27:29.490 --> 01:27:31.190
I'm going to say it's when we got to go,
but yeah.
Uh,

1457
01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:34.160
at the taping a few weeks ago.
Yeah.
Um,

1458
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:39.270
show one is finished in Denver and the Netflix reps come back in the green room

1459
01:27:39.271 --> 01:27:42.150
and they were like,
that was great show.
You know,
we got one more.

1460
01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:46.320
We want you to do it in Spanish.
I know,
but like they're like,
that was all like,

1461
01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:48.720
you're good.
You know the first one went great,

1462
01:27:48.810 --> 01:27:51.960
you know that thing you want to hear.
Yeah.
And then I was like,
yeah.

1463
01:27:51.961 --> 01:27:55.470
And we just kinda hung out.
And then she stands there for a second.
She goes,

1464
01:27:55.471 --> 01:27:58.650
I don't have any notes.
And I go,
okay.

1465
01:27:59.110 --> 01:28:02.670
But I think his name was Bert Kreischer.

1466
01:28:03.650 --> 01:28:08.340
<v 2>I started telling them
my name and your special,
yeah.</v>

1467
01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:11.090
This isn't one part.

1468
01:28:14.850 --> 01:28:17.460
<v 0>I just say that cause I,
I say,
you know,</v>

1469
01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:21.860
at some point I mentioned obviously that I looked different,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1470
01:28:22.410 --> 01:28:25.290
And they're like,
I get a big thing.
And then I go,
yeah,
I was in a,

1471
01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:27.490
<v 2>remember the Salami salesman that did the last one?</v>

1472
01:28:28.630 --> 01:28:29.463
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

1473
01:28:31.090 --> 01:28:33.140
<v 0>And weight loss contest.</v>

1474
01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:38.220
But every show I would start modifying different ways to say your name.

1475
01:28:39.250 --> 01:28:42.970
Yeah.
So I mean,
I think the first show I said burnt Chrysler and she's like,

1476
01:28:42.971 --> 01:28:46.580
I think it's Bert Kreischer.
I started lab.
So,
oh God.
And I go,

1477
01:28:46.590 --> 01:28:49.420
I'll probably say something different the next show.
And she's like,
really?
I go,

1478
01:28:49.421 --> 01:28:51.670
yeah.
She goes,
why are you doing?
I go,
it's disrespectful,

1479
01:28:52.810 --> 01:28:57.640
<v 2>Ruth.
She's like,
oh,
it's disrespectful.
Yeah.
It'd be like goes gears Bezel.</v>

1480
01:28:57.700 --> 01:29:00.680
I gotta go on my own Berg Christ.
Yeah.

1481
01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:05.250
<v 4>Um,
anyways,
Chrysler's burnt Chrysler.
Chrysler's burnt Chrysler.</v>

1482
01:29:05.490 --> 01:29:08.340
Leanne wants to be the call.
Forgot your real name just now.
Did you hear that?

1483
01:29:08.350 --> 01:29:11.280
I went Burke Chrysler.
Yeah.
Burnt Christ Leanne wants me to call it,

1484
01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:12.790
cause obviously I'm obviously the,

1485
01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:15.600
I don't think anyone will ever think I'll ever be able to do a show with my

1486
01:29:15.601 --> 01:29:18.950
shirt on ever again.
She wants to be called party on the boat.

1487
01:29:18.990 --> 01:29:22.860
No business on the bottom party on the top.
Why you started doing naked?

1488
01:29:22.861 --> 01:29:25.830
You could up the ante on your neck.
Special a hundred percent thing as possible.

1489
01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:29.750
Take about anywhere that people,
