1
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.280
Well.
Well,
well go to your mom's house,

2
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.373
Christina.

3
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.380
<v 2>Oh,
can you show me how to speak?
That's right.</v>

4
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.730
Can you,
can you pick them?

5
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.403
<v 3>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.410
<v 2>Paper was,
we could show them this big test part.</v>

7
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.930
<v 0>Okay.
Let's get
to,</v>

8
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.430
this is fun
talking to you about

9
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.540
are we talking to you about?

10
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.370
<v 3>Wow.
That was really,
wow.</v>

11
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.350
So impressive.
Yeah.

12
00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:23.351
That was a Mama titty farts by a k a bad friend.

13
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.730
It's really good.
Yeah.
Very,
very interesting.
Very good job.

14
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.500
I'm very impressed with your mother's flow.
Yeah.
She's a,
she's a natural,

15
00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:37.760
you know,
she can,
she's a big natural.
She does have those big naturals.
I'm sad.

16
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.870
I find it so funny that your dad is still feels jipped by the bra that fits her

17
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.550
like the we,
so it's such an insight into really how his mind works.
Yeah.

18
00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:52.500
Like if the Cup runneth over,
good,
but then her cup fits now and,

19
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.000
and he's like,
no,
I give me this,
those spillage to spillage of the test.

20
00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.110
I want to see those tits.
He likes the Jiggle.
Yeah,
he did.
He,
now he doesn't have,

21
00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:00.944
he did though.

22
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.980
He did provide some interesting insight into why he thinks like that.

23
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.300
If you paid attention there in that conversation he said,
you know,

24
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.670
when I was growing up or we go to the movies,

25
00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:17.980
there's no such thing as nudity or bikinis.
It was just the,

26
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.000
the thing was,
you know,
an open shirt on a woman and some cleavage.

27
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.970
So it's like your,
your mind.
It's funny,
like anything,

28
00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:30.140
it's all evolved in involving like your childhood,
your wires are connected,

29
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.840
everything and puberty and then for the rest of your life,

30
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.140
that's what turns you on.
And,
and,
and,
and it goes for everything.

31
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.510
Like everything that's like,
that upsets you.

32
00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:41.360
There's probably some tie to childhood,
you know?
Yes.
Well,

33
00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:45.170
I was listening to Shirley Manson and Joe Rogan talk about how,
um,

34
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.240
when in in your adolescence is actually Carolyn.
But yeah,
no,
it's Shirley Manson.

35
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.950
When you develop your musical tastes and adolescents.
Yeah.

36
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.060
And because that's like a formative time for you.

37
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.940
That's why you tend to like the same music that you started in high.

38
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.060
Absolutely was way,
same way.

39
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.540
I don't like anything past 1994 maybe like the strokes or like you find this or

40
00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:11.380
that that you enjoy,
but basically,
yeah,
you like this era.

41
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.470
I was just listening to golf music that I liked when I was 14 in the kitchen

42
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:18.880
before we did this.
And it's still,
it's still my jam.
That's still my mom jam.

43
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.240
So embarrassing.
What's wrong with the,
is it the phrase my jam?
Yeah,
of course.

44
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.380
But that's cool.
I thought it's a cooler.
Cool.
Well what am I supposed to say?

45
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:33.400
Like that's my song.
That's my band,

46
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.920
my jam,
my jam.
That's my jam.

47
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.830
I'm still,
I've so many things to share because I went to mom for,

48
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.960
to Denver with my BFF Shauna and I did a lot of,

49
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.580
I did a lot of big girl things.

50
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.030
I smoked pot for the first time and like two and a half gs.

51
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.400
And when I say that,
I mean I took one tiny little hit,

52
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.530
but it affected you,
right?
Yeah.
And we got crazy.
We watched the twilight movie,

53
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.520
the first one we did.
Yeah.
Edward Jacob.

54
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.290
I used to be team met or it and then I go to Jacob and then I go back.
What?

55
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.890
I said Jacob and you said absolutely not.
He member forever.

56
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.890
Why don't like the Edward Abandons her at some point in the movies?

57
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:21.160
Like he kind of,
he just neglects her.
I don't want to focus.
Got to eat,
man.

58
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.220
It's not like he leaves.
He does pussy eating.
Right.

59
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.380
Oh you think he went to go find other box,
other human beavers.

60
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.890
Now he's chased.
He's now it's all,
it's a Christian thing.

61
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.300
You got to watch with me.
There's like 10 movies looking really getting into it.

62
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.600
No,
I'm good.
It's not for dudes.
I like Harry Potter movies.

63
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.270
Those are the things that a lot.
Who's your favorite character?
I Dunno.
I like,

64
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.500
I like,
I just,
I'm fascinated by it.

65
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.370
We got into it a couple of Christmases ago and you watch that first one,

66
00:04:51.371 --> 00:04:55.200
you're like,
that's cute.
But then as the,
as the stories progress,

67
00:04:55.201 --> 00:04:59.310
it actually is just,
well first of all,
it's amazing film making,
right?

68
00:04:59.311 --> 00:05:02.650
So you know,
they,
they really kill it as far as that goes.

69
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:05.860
And then the stories get better and you just get invested in it.

70
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.870
And it's a,
it's a wonderful hero's journey.
And I like professor Snape.
He,

71
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.430
his teeth remind me of yours.
Just the bottom row that he didn't have done

72
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.560
professor's name?
No.
What's the reactors named?
Snubby he's dead right?
Yeah,

73
00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:28.490
he's dead.
Yeah.
He was such an amazing actor.
However,
the watch halter,

74
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.990
I could really watch him act in anything.
I know it's bothering them.

75
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.590
I forgot his name.
Is that part of the iron?
No,

76
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.790
he was so disdainful of the children,
which really I liked a lot.

77
00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:44.080
And he's Super Guy.
Thien witchy I liked that.
I liked a original.

78
00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:48.400
Dumbledore was,
was amazed.
The second Dumbledore.
You're like Alan Rickman.

79
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.190
That's his name.
What was his name?
God.
He's a good ass dead.
I know.

80
00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:55.630
He died like last year.
Pretty young to be to,
to die.
When did he die?
How old?

81
00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:01.100
Uh,
Alan Rickman was,
he was,

82
00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:04.310
he wasn't old at all.
I mean,
what did he die?

83
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.670
He died 69.
Come on,
Bro.

84
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.210
Pancreatic cancer though.
That's a nasty one.
Fuck.

85
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:15.950
Or son of a bitch.
Dude,

86
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.210
you have such amazing voice control,
right?

87
00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:25.610
The way that he would deliver a line and come control,

88
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.840
he would come so hard around those kids.
Nice.
Right.
Now,

89
00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:32.210
what would you do that you're ruining this moment?

90
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.460
It's really terrible that you would do that.
It's disrespect.

91
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.030
No shrieking mandrake stuff.

92
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.830
<v 4>Which Harry Potter movies.
This one</v>

93
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.320
hits puberty and they all do a train on her.

94
00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.300
Ron and Harry Bang

95
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.180
shows from teenager to adult.
Right.

96
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.850
This is her graduation ceremony.

97
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.780
And then the lady from down Abbey McGonagall,

98
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.880
she comes into the lesson.

99
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.240
This is her graduation sandwich is mine.

100
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.830
<v 3>He drinks a special potion that there and then they're like,
now you're a awake.</v>

101
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:27.690
That's great.
That's great.
Where you go with a very special moment.
Um,

102
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.710
we need to be reviewing all the movies.

103
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.310
I feel like we could do a better job than that.
Siskel and Ebert air.
Yeah,

104
00:07:34.311 --> 00:07:38.630
I think so too.
Fags.
Oops.
I'm not supposed to say that word anymore.

105
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.240
I know you can't help yourself.
Um,
all right,
let's get into it.
Let's get into it.

106
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.760
Is it Cisco and Roper?
It Roper and Hiebert?
Yeah,
there's a couple of,

107
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.260
actually two are dead.
Wow.
Remember when he had me?
Original?
Two guys are dead.

108
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.260
What's the original Osisko in Roper?
No.

109
00:07:57.261 --> 00:08:00.770
Siskel and Ebert Siskel died.

110
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.960
Then eBird got sick.
He was all like that.

111
00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:10.540
Cause he had like his jaw removed and then he died.
That was you made,

112
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:14.030
now that's your home.
I may have said Faa just now.
You don't have to spell it.

113
00:08:14.031 --> 00:08:19.030
You can say it.
And then you used to make fun of his mouth cancer cause mouth.

114
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.570
You did for years.
I didn't make fun of that.
He had cancer.
I,

115
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:28.890
I made light of the fact that I wouldn't have photographed him because it wasn't

116
00:08:30.471 --> 00:08:34.290
a good look.
It's not that you shouldn't be on television when you,

117
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:38.750
when your face is that messed up or like when you're really old sick when
you're,

118
00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:41.280
when you're dying.
It's like,
I don't know why these,

119
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.990
you know who I think had it had a pretty good a system for,

120
00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:48.530
it was a Johnny Carson when he retired.

121
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:52.850
You never saw a picture of him again if,
unless like someone hunted him down.

122
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.010
Yeah.
That's good.
Yeah.
So he got,
he got old and died.

123
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.310
You never knew what he looked like.
When you see these guys now that are like,

124
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.140
you know,
either sick or super old and,

125
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:08.130
<v 5>oh yeah,
I gotta be in the spotlight.
It's so narcissistic.
It is narcissism,</v>

126
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.080
narcissism.

127
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.950
Richard Simmons is kind of ducking out and I think people aren't letting him,

128
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:17.630
<v 3>they're not letting him.
But then there was,
there was,
uh,
there was,
um,</v>

129
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:22.170
rumors that somebody was,
you know,
taking advantage of them and all that.

130
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.280
<v 5>The housekeeper had kidnapped him or something like that.
I don't know.
Yeah.</v>

131
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.820
But Simmons has the right idea because he's aging and he just,
you know,

132
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.750
everyone wants to remember him is that fitness guy and the dolphin shorts.
Yeah.

133
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.590
You don't want to think of him as old Josh Zsa Gabor too.
She kind of faded out

134
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.960
<v 3>with open.
Unless I'm just so excited to be here.
A Lot,
a lot to cover.</v>

135
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.970
We'll go over it all.
Uh,
here we go.

136
00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.440
<v 6>Camel Jockey.
I wouldn't do that.</v>

137
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.550
Don't bring it to this.

138
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.610
<v 1>Well,
well,
well go to your mom's house.</v>

139
00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:09.560
We've told Circle
Christina.

140
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.333
Okay.

141
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.150
<v 3>Gosh guys,
Nice.
Yeah.
This is a,</v>

142
00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:56.970
I guess a some type of Jesus protests.
Yeah.

143
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.540
It looks like he's on a college campus.
That's what I understand.

144
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.730
That guy giving him the finger,
right?
Oh yeah.
Nobody likes him.
Really?

145
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.950
There's so much going on.
This is,
uh,
uh,
Jesus.

146
00:11:06.951 --> 00:11:11.780
He protests are you to the campus basically to provoke people and it's fun.
Yeah.

147
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.320
<v 5>No,
Betsy Harry Potter for a moment.
Sure.
Don't you feel like her Miami?</v>

148
00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:17.490
<v 3>Uh Huh.</v>

149
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:21.110
<v 5>And Harry would have been a better couple than Ron Weasley and her Maya knee.</v>

150
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.810
Yeah,
of course.
Yeah.
Hermione is like up here.
She's intelligent.

151
00:11:24.811 --> 00:11:27.870
She's hot and then kind of a loser.

152
00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.080
<v 3>Yeah,
but didn't,
they couldn't,
I mean,
who did a who did a,</v>

153
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.420
<v 5>I mean,
I like Ron,
don't get me wrong.
Okay.</v>

154
00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:36.390
<v 3>But eventually in the final one,
who did they show Harry width,
right?</v>

155
00:11:36.391 --> 00:11:41.310
He's like an adult and he's with the Asian Lady.
Had an Asian girlfriend.
No.
No.

156
00:11:41.311 --> 00:11:42.990
But in the final one,

157
00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.530
they do like a flash forward where he's an adult and he has kids member.

158
00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:51.180
Why he's winning Weasley Jenny.
Yeah.
So he and Jenny,

159
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.040
the Easleys,
you know that family,

160
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.320
<v 7>then they hook up.
She's younger than him,</v>

161
00:11:56.321 --> 00:11:58.330
so that's why they don't really hook up because there's no grass.

162
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.870
There's no grass on her field yet.
But then once the grass grows green,

163
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.030
then the day back to it,
right.

164
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:07.720
<v 4>That's the final movie.</v>

165
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:14.620
And then there's a,
you know,
there's a whole new series.
Shut up.

166
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.900
What do you mean?
I their horcrux

167
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:23.510
<v 7>there's a new,
there's a new serum messing with me.
No,
what's the show?
What is it?</v>

168
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:28.320
Forget.
I mean,
uh,
the son of HP,
let me,
let me see.

169
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.160
Oh No,
I like Ron Weasley.
Don't get me wrong.
He's,
he's charming.
He's sweet,

170
00:12:32.161 --> 00:12:34.320
he's vulnerable.
But I just feel like her mind,

171
00:12:34.321 --> 00:12:37.440
he's such a winner and Ron's kind of like,
mm.

172
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:42.480
Like kinda not a winner like Harry.
Yeah.
No,
I feel like Harry and her mind,

173
00:12:42.481 --> 00:12:45.570
you're equals
Jenny's.
Cool.

174
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.060
<v 3>She's all right.
But let's see what the new series is called.</v>

175
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:51.820
She's working on two new novels.

176
00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:52.803
<v 8>Good.</v>

177
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:58.040
<v 3>The native k wizarding community was particularly good.</v>

178
00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:02.630
The animal and plant magic.
I thought you were joking.
No,
I'm serious.
She's,

179
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.660
she's doing a whole new series man,
native American stuff.

180
00:13:05.661 --> 00:13:08.060
The writing is an enfolded.
Uh,
what?
Empathize Fan.

181
00:13:08.061 --> 00:13:11.090
No member Lisa of Harry Potter spinoff films.
Right.
Cool.

182
00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.400
Fantastic beasts and where to find them.

183
00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:14.883
<v 8>MMM.</v>

184
00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.020
<v 3>So yeah,
there's movies coming.
There's a new series coming.</v>

185
00:13:18.021 --> 00:13:18.980
She's doing a bunch of shit

186
00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.140
<v 7>now.
It's a native American theme.</v>

187
00:13:21.141 --> 00:13:23.450
Does that mean we're going to see a lot of dream catcher ski?
No,

188
00:13:23.451 --> 00:13:26.750
I don't like that aesthetic.
That south western aesthetic.
Uh,

189
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.240
are we gonna see a lot of Bolo ties.

190
00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:30.540
<v 8>Okay.</v>

191
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:35.040
<v 7>I Dunno.
I Dunno.
I don't know.
I hope not.
I Hate Butler time.
I let a case.
Okay.</v>

192
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.820
That's enough for me to turn off a movie.
Me Too.
Yeah.
I hate,

193
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:42.000
I hate somebody and they're wearing one.
I hate it.

194
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:46.230
It's not going to be a long conversation.
And also on heroin.
No.
Twilight.
Yeah.

195
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.090
Jacob gives her a dream catcher for her bed.
And I,
I,

196
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.010
that's immediately when I was like,
no team Edward for Wa.

197
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.930
That's when you switched.
That's the first time I felt the explanation.

198
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.130
I can't blame you.
I don't like those.
They're ugly.
Yes.

199
00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:03.270
<v 6>I sat up,
I was raised you white people crackers,</v>

200
00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:07.070
we'll give them racist.

201
00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:13.170
I call you Mexican six.
Is this your standard hour?

202
00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:14.950
It

203
00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:18.030
<v 7>feels like my hour.
Right?
Yeah.
That's interesting.</v>

204
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.760
There's,
by the way,
a big,

205
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:30.370
big week for big words.
I know.
I got some tweets.

206
00:14:30.371 --> 00:14:33.730
People are like,
are you doing bill Maher's thing is,
are you bill Maher?

207
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.550
I would just drop that Willy Nilly.
I do not.
No,
no,

208
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:43.990
but he problem with how he said it is that he did it like,

209
00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:48.560
like he was a black comic and yeah,
right.
To say that.
Yeah,
he did.
He did it.
Yeah.

210
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:51.980
But also a little bit,
um,

211
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:58.570
a little bit of delivering a joke like that is you do kind of,

212
00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:01.220
if you're going to say it,
you've got to kind of really go for it.

213
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:06.170
Did he not go for it?
No,
no,
no.
I'm saying like he,
he,
that's how you deliver.

214
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.190
If you're gonna,
if you're going to say that line the way he did it,

215
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:14.300
you can't have acid will tell people what the bit is here.

216
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:17.250
Here it is right now.
I'm not going to say it anymore.

217
00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.430
<v 9>You're welcome.
We'd love to have you work in the fields with us.</v>

218
00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:27.240
That's part of that.
I'm a housemate.

219
00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.050
Did say God

220
00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:39.870
<v 7>not girl,
and then he goes,
it's a job.
But it is like,
it's bold.
I mean,</v>

221
00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.970
look,
it's not the craziest thing I've ever heard.

222
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:45.660
I kind of liked it actually when I saw it,
I go,
oh,
I get it.
Like he's like,

223
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:47.800
we're in the field.
I don't know how.
Yeah,
I get it.
Yeah.

224
00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:52.200
You're not going to say you're not going to get me to build.
Um,

225
00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:57.570
I'm not,
I mean,
I'm never offended.
No,
of course it does.
Nothing but I,
I mean,

226
00:15:57.571 --> 00:16:01.110
I understand when people get upset.
It's funny.
I feel like a lot of comics,

227
00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:06.650
black comics,
not offended.
No,
I cannot see.
I got heard.

228
00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:11.070
No one bring it up.
I was at the store after this.
No one,
no one gives a shit.
No.

229
00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.320
It's white people that are generally outraged.
No,

230
00:16:13.321 --> 00:16:16.740
I saw a lot of black people outrage,
but not black comedians.
No.
Right.

231
00:16:16.741 --> 00:16:19.680
Not the comics.
Not Comics don't go like,
I cannot believe they're like,

232
00:16:19.681 --> 00:16:22.470
he's a comic.
He just went for it.
You know what's so funny?

233
00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.520
When I was working on that TBS show with Marlon Wayans and the line,
yeah.

234
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:29.100
A black comedians and that guy came out,
the owner of the,

235
00:16:29.101 --> 00:16:32.340
was it the Lakers at the time?
Yeah.
No,
no.
The clippers.
Yeah.

236
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:37.260
Claire's and his girl was seen with a black guy and he called them and he used

237
00:16:37.261 --> 00:16:40.020
the n word basically.
Is that what had happened?
Or she taped him.

238
00:16:40.021 --> 00:16:44.340
So it was a Donald sterling sterling.
That's right.
You recorded him saying like,

239
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:49.950
you know,
I don't like you being,
don't bring black people to the arena.

240
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.530
And like I,
you know,
I mean,
he was pretty overtly racist about a lot of stuff.

241
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:58.890
Yes.
He was like,
I don't even care if you fuck other guys.

242
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.400
Just don't bring them to the fucking game.
The black guy.
So the game.
Yeah.
Yeah.

243
00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.390
So,
so that happened and I was,
I was with them seeing them,
which is crazy.

244
00:17:06.391 --> 00:17:08.700
So I was working with a bunch of black people at the time on that.

245
00:17:08.701 --> 00:17:12.390
Black Comedians at the time,
not one of them were offended.
They're like,
oh yeah,

246
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.820
that,
that's just normal.
Like white people are racist.

247
00:17:14.821 --> 00:17:18.250
They were offended at the fact that she ratted him out.
Yeah.

248
00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.600
But she had snitched on him,
which I thought was really funny.
I'm like,

249
00:17:21.601 --> 00:17:23.400
you guys aren't even fazed by that.
They're like,
Nah,

250
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.760
white people are just racist.
That's a given.
Yeah.

251
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:30.210
I mean a lot of people thinking like that.
Yeah.
I mean,

252
00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.580
I'm saying that white people are Super Racist,
you know,
I think every,
you know,

253
00:17:35.581 --> 00:17:40.581
whatever they really caused the shit storm there was that Bill Maher saying,

254
00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:44.610
yeah,
yeah,
he gets really fired up about it.
I just don't,

255
00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:49.440
he's not my favorite.
Personally,
I'm not a huge fan.
I think people also,
you know,

256
00:17:49.441 --> 00:17:50.070
what they get more

257
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:55.070
<v 3>upset about then him saying it is when people assume like,</v>

258
00:17:55.171 --> 00:17:55.830
they,

259
00:17:55.830 --> 00:18:00.270
they think that he has given himself a pass.

260
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:04.230
In other words,
that he has the card,
you know,

261
00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:08.880
you fall card to say,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And,
and it's,

262
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:13.380
it's that point of view is further,
uh,

263
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:18.430
blown up by the fact that he publicly dates black women.

264
00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.280
So he's always,
he's wearing flat.
So I think there's part of it.
Um,

265
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:25.650
like the sentiment of like,

266
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:30.770
do you think just because you have sex with a lot of black women,

267
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.790
that that gives you that liberty?
Like you're still not,

268
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.630
you know,
granted the freedom to say what you want.

269
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:44.010
That's what I think a lot of people can get up,
which I 100% agree.

270
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.010
That point of view of being like you're not in the group.

271
00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:49.890
<v 7>Yeah.
You can't.
And even even like we can't,</v>

272
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.970
I always feel like I can't even speak on this topic because I go,

273
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:53.930
well that's the first thing.

274
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.440
That's the first thing that somebody would say breaking this down.
Oh,

275
00:18:58.441 --> 00:19:02.190
two white people are of course.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Which,
you know,
I understand that too,

276
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:06.840
but I still feel like,
you know,
it's in the,
it's also in the realm of comedy.

277
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.650
So we have,
uh,
some rights well too.
I mean,
we can,

278
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.490
we can talk about whatever we want [inaudible] to shit.
Talk Shit.
For what?
No,

279
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.730
I look as a comedian,
I always think it's a freedom of speech.

280
00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.090
I don't give a shit.
Say what?

281
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:23.100
There's so many things I've heard in comedy sometimes by my favorite Comedians

282
00:19:23.101 --> 00:19:26.940
who say sexist jokes and everything,
but it doesn't stop me from liking them.

283
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.000
You just go,
okay,
that's not,
you know,
hey,
that's not for me.

284
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.330
I think comedians always cares kind of stuff

285
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:36.680
<v 3>differently.
Yeah.
Like whenever somebody says a joke and they get in trouble,</v>

286
00:19:36.681 --> 00:19:38.270
you're still like,
okay,

287
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:43.570
because we've heard so many worse things and so many versions of that already.

288
00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:48.410
Like it's not like I've never hung out in a group and somebody has made a joke

289
00:19:48.411 --> 00:19:52.490
like bill made,
nobody's,
no one gets worked up,

290
00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:53.750
<v 7>nobody gets worked up.</v>

291
00:19:53.751 --> 00:19:56.960
But that's because the understanding is we all like each other.

292
00:19:56.961 --> 00:19:58.970
We're all friends,
we're all in it.

293
00:19:58.971 --> 00:20:02.150
You know what I then all malice and also like if you're going for the laugh,

294
00:20:02.151 --> 00:20:04.190
like I mean people say awful things going right

295
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:08.630
<v 3>for the laugh.
Yeah.
I mean I was just hanging out with somebody and they made,</v>

296
00:20:08.631 --> 00:20:13.631
they were telling me about lunch with a friend or another friend had died and

297
00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:19.130
the friend that died was very close to one of the people at the lunch.

298
00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:24.670
And the person told me about how they made a joke about like a joke about how

299
00:20:26.001 --> 00:20:30.440
somebody at the lunch was responsible for their friend's death,
which is like a,

300
00:20:30.441 --> 00:20:31.970
it's a harsh joke.
Yeah.

301
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
But you know the guy went with it cause he's a comic and realize that the

302
00:20:37.431 --> 00:20:39.310
comment was made to go for a joke.

303
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:41.360
<v 7>You know what I mean?
Like yes,
yes,
yes.
That's the thing.</v>

304
00:20:41.361 --> 00:20:45.090
Nobody else would have been like Jesus.
Like that guy has just died.
Well the,

305
00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.130
the intent is always with Comedians to make people

306
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:53.130
<v 5>laugh and just know that the intent is always for that end for joy at the end of</v>

307
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.140
the day.
So they may miss step.
You may offend too many people.

308
00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.360
Here's what I think.
Number one,
if it's funny,
then it's a success.
Yeah.

309
00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.280
If the audience doesn't laugh,
you've gone too far.

310
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.400
And that's how you know society right now in this time and space.

311
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.940
They're not into what you're doing.
Yeah.
You can't say that right now.
Okay.

312
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.150
That's fine.
That's it.
Yeah.
Now let's go to another one,

313
00:21:13.151 --> 00:21:16.270
which is Kathy Griffin who I love.
I think she's funny.

314
00:21:16.271 --> 00:21:18.850
I think she's had a great career.
She's fantastic.

315
00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:23.110
I think had that Trump thing been funny.
Yeah,
it would be a different story.

316
00:21:23.111 --> 00:21:26.230
And I think cause she went to serious and it was like an already statement

317
00:21:26.231 --> 00:21:29.770
versus like let's make this shit funny.
Cause imagine if it were funny,

318
00:21:29.771 --> 00:21:33.380
it would have been like a home run.
You know?
That's the only thing I think

319
00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:35.360
<v 3>Jan,
you know,
I'll,
I'll say it openly.</v>

320
00:21:35.361 --> 00:21:39.710
Like I have disdain for Trump.

321
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:44.680
I think he's a fucking embarrassment and a buffoon.
I can't stand them.

322
00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:47.540
Yeah.
At all.
And I don't think it's okay.

323
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:53.110
I don't think it's okay to do that to a sitting president because you can't pick

324
00:21:53.271 --> 00:21:58.271
and choose based on your preferences when it's okay.

325
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.600
Like to do that,
to make that gesture.

326
00:22:02.601 --> 00:22:07.490
It's not that I'm personally outraged,
it's just that like you have to,

327
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:10.880
you have respect for the office of president.
Yeah.

328
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.930
And if you are doing like decapitation,
um,

329
00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:19.550
portrayals of a sitting president,
you,
it's,

330
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.580
it's not okay to do.
I don't,
I don't feel like

331
00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.130
<v 5>you feel like it's more of a threat.
It's like a,</v>

332
00:22:24.131 --> 00:22:25.520
it's like I don't think a death threat.

333
00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:28.490
<v 3>Uh,
yeah.
So I mean,
and not to a degree,</v>

334
00:22:28.491 --> 00:22:33.491
I just feel like it's in such poor taste to do that regardless of whether or not

335
00:22:33.801 --> 00:22:38.300
you agree or disagree.
Right.
Present their point of views.
And,
and by the way,

336
00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.310
I thought it was,
I was,

337
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:45.980
it was grossly done when Obama was president.
There was all these,
I saw,

338
00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:50.380
you know,
new lynch things and they'd have little effigies and then,

339
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:52.230
and I thought that was,
well,
Ted Nugent,

340
00:22:52.231 --> 00:22:56.600
spin hang and presidents and effigy for I,
it's just,
it's gross to do.

341
00:22:56.601 --> 00:22:59.360
I don't think you should do it.
Um,
I,
like I said,

342
00:22:59.361 --> 00:23:01.950
it's not that I'm personally worked up about it.
Right.

343
00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:06.860
I just feel like you have to have some standard of how you treat a sitting

344
00:23:06.861 --> 00:23:11.120
president.
You can say what you want about them.
Obviously not threatening them.

345
00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:16.360
I feel like you can rip them apart however you feel about how stupid they are

346
00:23:16.821 --> 00:23:19.460
and how they are completely,
you know,

347
00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:24.580
out of like just not at all I'm capable of of their job and that how every

348
00:23:26.961 --> 00:23:28.130
decision they make is,

349
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:33.260
is absolutely insane and an embarrassment and how you don't think they'll make

350
00:23:33.261 --> 00:23:35.630
it even through it.
Anything you want to say about it as that,

351
00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:40.450
but when you start like decapitating them and showing,
right,
right,
right.

352
00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:44.440
It's just,
it's so,
it's beyond classless.
It's,
it's just,
it's,

353
00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:48.560
it's so to do to the head of state.
I don't think you should do it.

354
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.150
I just don't think.
Interesting.
Interesting.

355
00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:53.270
I tend to differ with you and only because I'm,

356
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:57.770
I'm just gone free association here.
When communism fell,

357
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
I'm a big symbol of that was taking down the statues and beheading the statues,

358
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:08.600
taking down the symbolism of the oppressor of the thing you don't agree with.
So,

359
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:13.990
I don't know if Kathy also a statue is usually of a former person.

360
00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:17.990
It's already the power's already been usurped or maybe it's a revolutionary

361
00:24:17.991 --> 00:24:19.130
thing where you,

362
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:23.360
you're about to overthrow power structure and that's like a symbol of

363
00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:26.090
overthrowing the capitated Reagan head.

364
00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:31.100
That's great because you're saying like whatever.
Okay,
I hate it.
He's also dead.

365
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:31.963
He's gone.

366
00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:35.960
But if you have the current sitting president and your decapitating them,

367
00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.650
I don't really feel like that's,
I dunno.
I don't think I get,
I get the,

368
00:24:39.651 --> 00:24:43.430
you're sending a message and it's a,
it's a strong one.
But,
um,

369
00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:48.440
I think you have to have some level of respect for,

370
00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.230
uh,
someone who's in power at the moment.

371
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:55.310
We may just have to agree to disagree on this one cigarette.

372
00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.110
I don't think you have to,

373
00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.710
you shouldn't not be able to say crazy shit.

374
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:05.060
The imagery is,
is not respectful.
Well,

375
00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:08.960
that lends itself to more things like that.

376
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.380
And that's one of the reasons why I think it's like,
it's gets a little crazy.

377
00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:15.480
You start decapitating a president in,

378
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:19.490
in obviously artistically smearing blood all over,

379
00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:24.080
and then that fires up people who agree with that sentiment,

380
00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.370
then it just lends itself to,
I mean I,

381
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:31.670
it just can make that type of action more acceptable.

382
00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:35.480
And then you have like inciting violence in a sentence is a very exciting,
yeah.

383
00:25:35.481 --> 00:25:35.681
You're,

384
00:25:35.681 --> 00:25:40.681
you're inciting art to crime or too to go along those lines.

385
00:25:41.091 --> 00:25:45.310
I Dunno.
I,
okay.
What about just disrespect now?
I like the ones,
uh,

386
00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:49.510
remember that artist who had him with a tiny penis,
that was fantastic.

387
00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.850
And that's the thing is that if it's disrespectful,
it's funny.

388
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.420
But if it's violence,
yes.

389
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:57.680
I don't think you shouldn't be able to disrespect the president.

390
00:25:57.681 --> 00:26:00.910
So do you not like the naked tiny Peter?
I love that one.
Oh,

391
00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:01.850
well that's disrespect.

392
00:26:01.851 --> 00:26:05.090
I'm saying I don't feel like you shouldn't be allowed to disrespect them.

393
00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:07.060
I feel like when you have like,

394
00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:11.900
like really extreme violent depictions of you're sitting president,

395
00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:16.850
I dunno.
I don't think that really helps.
Fair enough.
Well,

396
00:26:16.851 --> 00:26:19.760
she certainly got the backlash for it,
by the way.

397
00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:25.030
The backlash that I thought would come from the decapitation thing would be

398
00:26:25.731 --> 00:26:27.380
things like what I'm saying like,
Hey,

399
00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:30.740
I think this is pretty crazy that you're decapitating our president.
Right.

400
00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:33.890
You know,
as much as I am not a fan,
I think that's pretty crazy.

401
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:39.440
I didn't think she would have to do a press conference and that she was openly

402
00:26:39.441 --> 00:26:44.160
weeping in the press conference.
I,
I'm a little familiar with how Kathy's

403
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.660
<v 7>dealt with things in the past.
She tends to be very dramatic.
I will say that,</v>

404
00:26:48.661 --> 00:26:50.010
cause I remember when she lost,

405
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:55.110
she took over the Joan Rivers show when Joel River Past Joan Rivers past and you

406
00:26:55.111 --> 00:26:59.520
know,
she got fired from that show or quit or something and she made it a big,

407
00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:04.330
she may be stern and she was,
if you an emotional.
So she's basically fueling it.

408
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.650
Yes.
Yes.
And I think,
and let's be honest,

409
00:27:07.651 --> 00:27:12.060
that Kathy's a very provocative comedian.

410
00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:15.660
She likes to talk some shit.
She likes to throw shade.
That's her whole thing.

411
00:27:15.661 --> 00:27:18.990
And I think with the Trump thing,
she was looking for a little like,
Ooh,

412
00:27:18.991 --> 00:27:21.360
this is going to zing.
This is going to cause a buzz.

413
00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:26.010
And I think it was a little too much buzz.
You know what I'm saying?
The blowback.

414
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.880
But again,
if it were funny,
I just,
then I feel like it would have been a hit.

415
00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.680
I know it'd be so much better when I,
you know,

416
00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:37.170
I guess I kind of missed part of it.
Like I saw the image,

417
00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:41.440
I didn't blink when I didn't give a shit.
Like,
man,

418
00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:45.750
she hates him.
Like so many people do.
They get it.
I mean,

419
00:27:45.751 --> 00:27:49.410
like I really was just like,
I don't care.
Then there was like,
oh,

420
00:27:49.411 --> 00:27:52.680
did you hear Kathy Kathy Griffin's in trouble?
And I was like,
oh,
okay.

421
00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:57.360
And then when I saw that like there's going to be in a pile,
I was like,
Nah,

422
00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:01.310
I don't know.
But I get,
I get that,
that you,

423
00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:06.570
I don't think you should have a violence encouraged to sitting heads of state.

424
00:28:06.991 --> 00:28:10.580
I don't think it's a good idea.
And then there you go.
Yeah.
Well I,
you know,

425
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:14.550
I feel bad for her.
I like her and I,
I hope that this kind of smooths out.

426
00:28:14.551 --> 00:28:18.960
I don't.
You know what's just a fine comic then?
No,
I mean let to let it,

427
00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:23.880
let her have a Gig.
She'll she'll,
she'll be fine.
She'll be fine.
What's the law?

428
00:28:23.881 --> 00:28:27.480
She doesn't get to host fucking New Year's Eve or whatever.
The Anderson.
Wow.

429
00:28:27.481 --> 00:28:30.180
Big Shit.
She's got many other jobs.
She'll,
she'll be fine.

430
00:28:30.181 --> 00:28:31.440
Do you want to host that?
No.

431
00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:35.880
I'd rather blow my brains out when you can you think of anything?
First of all,

432
00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:37.020
they have to say nothing

433
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:41.570
<v 5>for five hours like,
well,
this sure does look like a full house tonight.</v>

434
00:28:41.571 --> 00:28:44.780
Anderson right behind me.
You'll see the ball and you're like,

435
00:28:44.781 --> 00:28:48.650
what are you fucking talking about for five hours I blow my fucking brains out

436
00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:53.780
coming up.
Next one direction's going to sing their hit song like,
oh my God,

437
00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.550
I would fucking kill.
I'd rather talking about it endlessly.
Man.

438
00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:02.960
She tours constantly.
She's publishing books.
Some very successful,

439
00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:05.630
she doesn't need that fucking she'll,
she's fine.

440
00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:10.250
I know somebody was like huge following.
Not why,

441
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:15.090
because none of her fans would stop buying tickets to,
she's beloved.
She,

442
00:29:15.091 --> 00:29:19.460
the gay community loves Kathy Griffin.
She,
she's doing theaters.

443
00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:23.720
She's fine.
She's doing great.
There are no toward,

444
00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:28.080
well she cancelled them.
She did.
She did when this happened and everything.

445
00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:31.610
Absolutely.
I think it's a little heavy for her right now.
So she cancelled them.

446
00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:34.850
She's doing,
she's doing fine.
She's really see it.

447
00:29:34.851 --> 00:29:36.780
But none of them would stop buying tickets.

448
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:40.160
The fans probably like her more of course,
because they're,
you know,

449
00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:41.950
they're probably Trump as well.

450
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:46.570
<v 3>It's fantastic.
She was,
I mean,
I guess who knows if these are still,</v>

451
00:29:46.571 --> 00:29:51.571
cause these are some of these are ways away community arts center or Saint

452
00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:55.670
George Theater in New York later.
Yeah,
she's doing fine.
She's doing fine.
Ah,
no,

453
00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:56.523
no,
no.

454
00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:03.163
<v 6>Jackie's.</v>

455
00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.160
<v 3>I liked it.
He goes,
I wouldn't do that.</v>

456
00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:16.490
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

457
00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:26.530
<v 3>and then he goes,
I would never,
how come I would never do that as I'm doing that.</v>

458
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:31.450
What?
The Gay Rainbow Flag.
You know,
it's funny.
He's a,

459
00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:35.530
he's a a college level.
Kathy Griffin though.
He's just like,

460
00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:39.130
he's a provocateur though.
He's just doing that to get a reaction.

461
00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:40.403
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

462
00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:45.800
<v 3>She's got the jokes though.
She is.
No,
I know,
but it's,
it is to incite a reaction.</v>

463
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.880
That's,
that's all he's doing.

464
00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:49.353
<v 6>Oh,</v>

465
00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:56.620
<v 3>I love that.
People get mad at that.
That guy like he's just a fucking subway act,</v>

466
00:30:56.621 --> 00:30:57.401
you know what I mean?

467
00:30:57.401 --> 00:31:01.720
Like some lunatic and a fucking car and he's going to where they like they

468
00:31:01.721 --> 00:31:02.590
didn't come see him.

469
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:07.800
He just went to like the student union outside $30 a ticket for that shit.

470
00:31:08.771 --> 00:31:13.630
Fuck no man.
Can dummy.
Dummy.
Can I tell you what I discovered?

471
00:31:13.631 --> 00:31:18.250
You know how you and I talk about how we suffer for years before we make slight,

472
00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:22.390
like we would use one phone charger in the house versus just by five.

473
00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:28.910
So for 40 years I've been wearing shoes without socks and I fucking hate it.

474
00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:31.900
I hate it so much.

475
00:31:31.901 --> 00:31:36.280
My feet are very sweaty and I fucking ruined shoes and my feet are sweaty all

476
00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:40.930
day and I just hate,
hate,
hate it.
So I was like,
can I talk to you about that?

477
00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:46.060
I was like,
wait to people,
like,
do you wear socks and slip on shoes?
And you go,

478
00:31:46.061 --> 00:31:50.410
yeah,
you can buy invisible socks.
They're like barely cover your foot.
Yeah.

479
00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:54.090
Did you just buy,
I've just bought them on Amazon using our banner,

480
00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:55.450
your mom's house,
podcast.com.

481
00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:58.260
Click on the banner at the top of the homepage and um,

482
00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:03.370
it's changed my whole life and now I,
I like,
I'm so much happier about it.

483
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:08.400
My feet don't sweat all day and only took 40 years to figure out that that's

484
00:32:08.681 --> 00:32:10.240
what people have been doing.
You,
I mean,

485
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.870
you've seen me with little ankle socks so many times,

486
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:16.810
but you know what I think and my fucked up eastern black brain.

487
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.270
Those are not for me.
Oh,
right.

488
00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:22.810
Those are what fancy people have crazy brains do that.

489
00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:27.790
Your brain will do that to you.
I don't deserve ankle socks.

490
00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.880
What do you Bougie?
I went to the chiropractor,

491
00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:36.450
the human mechanics and I've noticed that like I'm getting a slight hump at the

492
00:32:38.321 --> 00:32:42.770
top of my back and I was just like,
well,
I'll just be there.

493
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:45.680
It's like one of the first thing he said,
he's like,
Oh yeah,

494
00:32:45.681 --> 00:32:49.780
I can get that out of you.
Make a couple adjustments.
Isn't that amazing?

495
00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:51.170
Any better?
It's already better,
but yeah,

496
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:56.320
that we just accept the battery years now.
Just that'll hurt bad.

497
00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:03.140
I know.
It's so stupid.
My of the tooth that I just,
the crown,
I just got replaced.

498
00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:06.890
That thing hurt me for like five years.
Yeah.
Five years.

499
00:33:06.891 --> 00:33:08.570
I would have to floss around it.

500
00:33:08.571 --> 00:33:11.420
It would hurt every time I ate something that would get food,

501
00:33:11.421 --> 00:33:14.720
we'll get caught in it.
And I was like,
well guess I have to suffer.

502
00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:18.640
It's expensive to replace a crown.
Can't do that.
Just let your teeth hurt.

503
00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:23.510
My mouth hurt a lot.
Um,
let's tell him right now,

504
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:28.070
cause this is passive fucking big month.
Big Mud.

505
00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:29.420
Big words.
Yeah,

506
00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:35.480
<v 5>you're a,
you only have a couple of weeks left.
I'm so pumped.
First of all,</v>

507
00:33:35.481 --> 00:33:37.630
I want to thank everybody that came out to Denver.

508
00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:42.320
Comedy works a big shout out to the mommies who work at the comedy works.

509
00:33:42.321 --> 00:33:46.610
Apparently they're huge fans of the show and they played Mom's house music all

510
00:33:46.611 --> 00:33:49.700
weekend and it was such a thrill and thank you to all the mommies who came out.

511

Yeah,

It's best.

560
00:37:03.641 --> 00:37:08.100
Six months after I did,
um,
like,
hey,
you didn't even,

561
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:11.710
you know,
and I got on this thing called Friendster.
It was really cool.

562
00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:16.090
I forgot to,
uh,

I had something set up great.

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:31.230
Big tits.
And for me it's really neat.
Gold.

566
00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.860
See Christina doing stand up.
[inaudible] we're talking,
by the way,

567
00:37:34.861 --> 00:37:37.410
this is one of my favorite things.
We didn't get to last week.

568
00:37:37.411 --> 00:37:39.610
We had my parents on top dog and,

569
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.420
and at a certain point,

570
00:37:42.421 --> 00:37:46.500
you know it went on long enough but there was one point afterwards where I was

571
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:50.220
trying to show them non binary things just to get their reaction on it.

572
00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:51.990
I looked it up.

573
00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:57.180
So it's 41 minutes in that we've been sitting here at,
my dad was there,

574
00:37:57.181 --> 00:38:02.110
my mom was here,
I'm here,
we have I playing clips and it's that the,

575
00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:04.770
it's the first time where my dad goes,
I don't hear anything.

576
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:10.560
And this is when we discover that for 41 minutes he didn't have headphones

577
00:38:10.561 --> 00:38:12.420
plugged in but never said anything.

578
00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:16.260
They were on his ear and we're having this conversation,

579
00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:20.520
catch her line and he just never mentioned its definitions here because people

580
00:38:20.521 --> 00:38:23.730
will hear the term non binary and not know what that means.

581
00:38:23.731 --> 00:38:26.460
And in fact some people here,
uh,
non binary and say,

582
00:38:26.461 --> 00:38:30.960
well why not Trans Man or Trans Woman?
How would you answer those two questions?

583
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:35.230
I want to hear anything.
No,
what do you mean you don't hear anything?
Nothing.

584
00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:36.070
You didn't

585
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:40.810
<v 10>hear any of that?
No.
Did you hear that mom?
Yes,
there were.
I didn't hear a word.</v>

586
00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:43.900
No,
that'll work.
Okay.

587
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:48.430
You hear me in the microphone right now?
No,
you don't hear me right now.

588
00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:56.110
You haven't heard anything this whole time?
No.
You pulled your headphone out.

589
00:38:56.530 --> 00:39:00.550
Where does it go in here?
But he did whatever.
Add it in there the whole time.

590
00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:09.000
I see him doing you lay back and he put it out.
Okay.
Can you hear me now?
Yeah.

591
00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:12.200
I never had it on actually this whole time.
No.

592
00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.133
<v 9>No,</v>

593
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:21.560
<v 10>cause they didn't actually wait.
All right.
Once you play these,</v>

594
00:39:21.561 --> 00:39:25.360
uh okay.
And that's how it'd be good hear.
I wasn't out.
He,
he,

595
00:39:25.361 --> 00:39:27.650
I'm never ever,

596
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:32.540
<v 3>he didn't even hear what the fuck you were saying.</v>

597
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:37.710
So like right now he just heard like muted sound cause he put headphones on but

598
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:42.230
had nothing plugged in but didn't.
Wow.
That's amazing.
And everyone was like,

599
00:39:42.231 --> 00:39:45.830
Oh I don't hear anything through my apropos,
our discussion earlier of like,

600
00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:48.050
well I guess it's just not,
that's how it goes.

601
00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:53.230
It's also exactly like who he is.
I don't really need to hear

602
00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:58.800
right.
As long as I can hear my own thoughts.

603
00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:04.290
And then this was great.
This is when I,
um,
so I got charter to say that.

604
00:40:04.291 --> 00:40:08.490
And then it was,
I was trying to get top dog to say,
I wrote,

605
00:40:08.491 --> 00:40:12.300
I had this joke and Improv joke and if you ever saw the people's mayor,

606
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:16.500
which is on my youtube page where it's kind of like this parody of Rob Ford,

607
00:40:16.501 --> 00:40:20.820
the old Toronto mayor that I made a couple of years ago with some really

608
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.250
talented people,
you know,

609
00:40:23.251 --> 00:40:28.050
we would improvise lines and I had one where I'm playing that guy and I go,
hey,

610
00:40:28.051 --> 00:40:32.160
how come I come?
If you think you're going to fart and you shit,

611
00:40:32.161 --> 00:40:33.060
there's a name for that.

612
00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:36.270
What about when you think you're going to shit and you fart?

613
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:39.240
There's no name for that.
So I try to get top dog,
just say it.

614
00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:41.790
This is what it's like to try it again.

615
00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:46.350
<v 10>Get him to,
to say,
uh,</v>

616
00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:51.160
here we go.
Hold on.
Let's see.
No,
that's the only,

617
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:54.420
I know there's been another song made for you,
but I don't to see where it is.

618
00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:57.930
That's okay.
Um,
so will you say for me though?
Uh,

619
00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:03.150
do you like big tits and just say,

620
00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:08.400
do you like big tits?
Go See Christina.
She goes wrong.
Yeah.
Okay.

621
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:11.970
Yeah.
Do you like big debts?
God.
See Christina,

622
00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:16.630
let's do the same thing that go see Christina do standup.

623
00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.550
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Did you like big debts?

624
00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:25.740
Go see Christina doing stand ups.
Now we are talking and you go.

625
00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:31.770
Yeah,
now we're trying to get top.

626
00:41:31.771 --> 00:41:36.020
Don't you say,
oh no.
How come?

627
00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:40.010
Sometimes you think you're going to fart and you shit.

628
00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.600
And there's a name for that.

629
00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:45.440
What about when you think you're going to shit and you only fart?

630
00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:46.633
What's that called

631
00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:57.470
when you think you're going to fart and you should,
there's a name for that.

632
00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:01.280
But when you think you're going to shit and you only Fart,
what's that called?

633
00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:04.620
Do you think that that's pretty like

634
00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:09.730
<v 7>get that out right now if I when you fart.
But Shit,</v>

635
00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.593
there's a name for that.

636
00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:15.340
But how come when you shit and you know bar none in front of you struggled to I

637
00:42:15.341 --> 00:42:17.280
can't repeat lines.
That's why.
Yeah.
Okay.

638
00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:20.670
Because the funny thing is I thought it was pretty easy to repeat it.

639
00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:21.683
I wouldn't know

640
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:23.203
<v 10>really,</v>

641
00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:25.980
<v 7>but my mom and resident meeting,</v>

642
00:42:25.981 --> 00:42:29.280
I have to read it cause I can't repeat things back.
If you had it written down,

643
00:42:29.281 --> 00:42:30.114
I can memorize it.

644
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:33.860
<v 10>I have to see when you fart and you shit</v>

645
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.850
does your name for that.
No,
no,
no,
no.

646
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:39.990
When you think you're going to fart and shit,

647
00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:45.610
how come when you think you got far and you shit doesn't matter for that but

648
00:42:47.391 --> 00:42:52.140
then you shit and you think no different though.

649
00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:53.220
You think you're going to show,

650
00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:57.650
you know you're so disorder when you think you're going to shit and then you

651
00:42:57.651 --> 00:43:01.520
fart.
What's that called?
Yeah.
Can you do it all together though?

652
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:06.410
I'm not sure I'm going to do it.
Yeah,
she's okay.
She's an actor.

653
00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:09.630
She's great that doesn't understand this.

654
00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:15.080
He says how come when he saying he's going to Fart but he shit.

655
00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:19.280
There is a name for bed and then he's one that he keeps asking me all the time

656
00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:22.160
had come where he sees he's willing to ship but don't start.

657
00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:26.570
There's no name for that.
Perfect.
You can do that,
right?

658
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:31.880
How come?
Well,
I'm going to Fart and I,
shit,

659
00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:34.160
there's a name for that.

660
00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:39.020
What's it called when you think you've got a shed and you only fart?

661
00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.630
That's their call.
That's it.
You got it perfect.
That was really good.

662
00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:45.350
And you can do it.
That's how I was.
Good Dad.
That was,
that was perfect.

663
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:48.260
What is that called?
That's the thing.

664
00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.980
So when you think you're going to fart and you should,
it's called a short,

665
00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:55.400
you know,
I didn't know there was a name for this.
So it's like,
you know,
you go,

666
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:59.930
oh,
and then you're like,
oh shit.
What about you?
I have to take a shit.

667
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:03.500
And you only fart.
There's no name for that.
There really isn't.

668
00:44:03.501 --> 00:44:05.030
There should be though.
That's what I'm thinking.

669
00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:07.710
What are we can capitalize on that?
I think our audience should write it.

670
00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.380
<v 7>Great idea.
We're going to call it.
What are we going to call that?
Okay,</v>

671
00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:14.290
so when you,
you think you're going to shit,
but you only fart.

672
00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:15.080
What does that mean?

673
00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:20.080
Just to lay it out when you think you're going to fart and you shit is called a

674
00:44:20.811 --> 00:44:24.430
short.
Everybody knows that.
Right?
So you're like,
oh,
you feel confidence to Fart.

675
00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:27.040
Oh,
it comes up.
Well,
what about when you're like,

676
00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:30.550
I gotta take a shit and you just sit down and you fart.
Right.

677
00:44:30.551 --> 00:44:32.010
It's only a disappointment.
Yeah,

678
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.040
<v 3>but there should be a name for that.
I know.
I know.
Okay.
Let's see.</v>

679
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:37.820
It's not called a dump.
It's called a,

680
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:43.170
it's like a hump or a slut whisperer.
A slump.
Yeah.

681
00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:48.060
Yeah.
It's not as shit,

682
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:52.580
but a flit,
flip bump.

683
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:56.610
Thump.
Thump is like a fart that was done right.

684
00:44:58.170 --> 00:44:59.070
There you go.
It's a fun,

685
00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.570
it's a fun and fucked I farted when I should have dumped.
Yeah.

686
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:05.783
Do you think,

687
00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:08.790
how excited is my dad once somebody comes back to the bet for the bat?

688
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.670
How was it a font?
Yeah.
Yeah.

689
00:45:11.671 --> 00:45:15.960
How excited you think my dad is when he pay like $100,000 for my education and

690
00:45:15.961 --> 00:45:18.750
we just came up with fump.
Well if you,

691
00:45:18.751 --> 00:45:22.590
if you send him some of the responses in these emails within could be very proud

692
00:45:22.591 --> 00:45:25.580
of you.
Yeah,
but dad,
look at all these fump responses.
We get

693
00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:32.190
bumped and a
fump is good.

694
00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:36.130
I like fump.
Fump sounds like a disappointment to want one word.

695
00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:40.710
Like it's a disappointment to fom.
Yeah,
I wanted a dump,
but I farted.

696
00:45:40.711 --> 00:45:44.940
I found no,
I think that that works really good.
Work talks.

697
00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:50.550
I'm okay.
It was only a fump.
Yeah,
right.
Or could have been better,

698
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:54.900
but it was just a fun just to fump.
Yeah.
No,
you know what that is.

699
00:45:54.901 --> 00:45:58.560
I was hoping for,
but I funk.
It's just a fart.
That's why,

700
00:45:58.561 --> 00:46:01.020
because you're saying I went to shit,
but I just farted.

701
00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:04.470
Then all you did was fart.
You didn't create anything new with a shark.

702
00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.520
You creating a new entity.
Correct.
It's a fart with shit in it,

703
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:13.560
but it's a fart that had expectations.
So it's not just a fart.

704
00:46:13.561 --> 00:46:18.150
I mean a far,
it's all that came out of you,
but it's tied to a bigger idea.

705
00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:19.170
That's what you're saying.

706
00:46:19.171 --> 00:46:24.030
We've created a third idea being the failed failed dump.
Yeah.

707
00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:27.840
So it's a fart that failed in its mission to push out the shit because it was,

708
00:46:27.841 --> 00:46:32.250
my mother used to say thoughts Bush the shit out.
Right?
So when it fails,

709
00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:36.420
it's a failure fart and other words interesting as deep,
Bro.

710
00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:42.270
We gotta put this on the other show.
That was pretty good man.
Well,

711
00:46:42.271 --> 00:46:43.830
let's take some submissions guys,

712
00:46:43.831 --> 00:46:48.831
write us and let us know your mom's podcast@gmail.com what the word is for when

713
00:46:49.411 --> 00:46:54.120
you know house.
It's your mom's podcasts.
We couldn't get that one.

714
00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:58.440
Speaking of farts slept.
Mommy's.
Here's an email.

715
00:46:58.441 --> 00:47:02.820
I recently had a shower time conversation with my beloved wife regarding a very

716
00:47:02.821 --> 00:47:07.050
special type of Fart,
only experienced in shower time situations.

717
00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:09.900
I will tell you after I told my wife I did this,

718
00:47:09.901 --> 00:47:12.060
she gave me the look like I crossed the line.

719
00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:16.650
I guess I can only describe it as Fart gargling and it's really special

720
00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:19.690
sometimes when I need to Fart.
While showering,
I jumped.

721
00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:24.830
I gently cut my head over my ass holding water in a cup like fashion before

722
00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:27.690
letting loose the trumpets.

723
00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:32.840
This results in a gargle like situation that is really neat upon telling my wife

724
00:47:33.461 --> 00:47:36.850
about this because I have never done it in front of her.
She said,

725
00:47:36.851 --> 00:47:41.710
I must be the only one on earth that does such a thing.
I can't be the only one.

726
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:44.530
Please consult the mommies of the world.

727
00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:49.360
I hope users keep it high and tight with your genes and the clouds.

728
00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:52.310
P K I'll tell you this,
I've never done it,

729
00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.780
but I find it fascinating and I'm willing to bet.

730
00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:01.800
There's a lot of listeners that either do that aversion of that or have their

731
00:48:01.841 --> 00:48:02.040
own,
yeah.

732
00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:05.970
<v 7>Unique fart kind of situation,
you know?
Of course.
Now did it.</v>

733
00:48:05.971 --> 00:48:08.310
You do a thing where you played the trumpet,

734
00:48:08.311 --> 00:48:11.340
where you manipulated your butt cheeks and then made it made different.

735
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:15.870
<v 3>Oh,
I really liked doing that.
I really,
I really,
really like that.</v>

736
00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:21.050
I like to move my leg and also play with my butt cheeks.

737
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:23.530
Yeah,
because the pitch will change.
Right?

738
00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:28.110
Or you can even do it by squatting because you know your cheeks will move as you

739
00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:31.960
as you move.
So if you have to bath to Fart and you just do a half squat,
yeah,

740
00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:33.570
you'll hear it.
You'll hear the pitch change.

741
00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:38.170
You know what's really interesting about you is that you close stuff,

742
00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:39.840
slick stuff,
meat,
stock.

743
00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:44.780
<v 7>You're really a risk taker with these farts because personally I'm afraid to</v>

744
00:48:44.781 --> 00:48:48.480
move too much around because what if the Brown comes down?
Yeah.
I,

745
00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:50.660
I'm just kinda afraid.
I'm confident.

746
00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:55.010
When's the last time you started [inaudible]?
It's been a little while.

747
00:48:55.640 --> 00:49:00.180
A year or two and yeah,
I'm a little nervous to do all that fancy stuff now.

748
00:49:00.181 --> 00:49:00.320
Right.

749
00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.290
<v 3>I know I almost had a bad one.</v>

750
00:49:02.291 --> 00:49:05.560
I had this upper respiratory infection and a couple of weeks ago.
Yeah.

751
00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:09.760
And I took an antibiotic that like is one of the side effects,

752
00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:11.560
like you might get severe diarrhea,

753
00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:16.860
but I'm somebody that always on those side effect things just never gets the

754
00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:20.620
dude.
I got a harsh bout of it.

755
00:49:20.621 --> 00:49:23.890
So I had to quit the antibiotic two days later.

756
00:49:23.891 --> 00:49:26.730
It was still kind of filtering through me.
Me.

757
00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:31.790
<v 7>Yeah.
I remember one of my first farts confident I went,</v>

758
00:49:31.791 --> 00:49:35.660
I went for it as I was going for it.
I go,
Oh,

759
00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:39.590
you might've done that too soon and it's still,
you know,
hung in there.

760
00:49:39.591 --> 00:49:42.830
It was interesting.
Interesting.
It was,
it was dicey.

761
00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:46.340
You know what I've been having lately?
Remember when I first gave birth to Ellis,

762
00:49:46.341 --> 00:49:50.180
I couldn't hold in farts.
Yeah.
It's kind of comeback.
Yeah.

763
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:51.960
And I don't know why.
Yeah.

764
00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:56.090
But either that or I'm just not as concerned with who hears the farts anymore.

765
00:49:56.091 --> 00:50:00.920
I don't care.
Yeah.
I've been fighting very freely lately and it feels great.

766
00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:04.400
Yeah.
I don't care.
Can I tell you something?

767
00:50:04.401 --> 00:50:06.950
Shauna told me this weekend that was alarming what?

768
00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:10.070
She said that in her world,

769
00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:15.050
the double pipe classic is not as rare as we say it is that she has them like

770
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:18.050
every few months.
She doesn't know what she's talking about.
That's what I said.

771
00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:21.950
Yeah,
that's what I said.
We'll have class.
It's very rare.
Right.

772
00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:26.990
She's probably thinking of like a one,
two,
but like equal exit.
That's very rare.

773
00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:28.250
Well,
to get the timing

774
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:31.100
<v 3>precise on something like that,
it's really coincidence.</v>

775
00:50:31.101 --> 00:50:35.810
It's really chance Fart,
fart.
Burb right.
You know,

776
00:50:35.811 --> 00:50:39.780
but to have them go at the same time,
very rare.
It's very rare.

777
00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:43.270
And especially as you can try to force it,
you can swallow it and it's not,

778
00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:46.430
that's not a true,
it's not the nature of a double pill.
You can be like,
oh,

779
00:50:46.431 --> 00:50:49.250
I got to Fart in the chamber.
I know I'm about to Fart.

780
00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:53.210
I'm going to swallow some air.
Maybe that's what she's doing.

781
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:56.990
I feel like she's forcing the issue.
I Shauna,

782
00:50:56.991 --> 00:51:00.410
I wonder if you're not,
it's,
it has to be organic.

783
00:51:00.411 --> 00:51:01.970
That's the whole fun of the double pipe.

784
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:06.600
This is funny that this came in because blue band prep this.
Yeah.

785
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:10.670
And he didn't even know what was going to happen today.
And here's what I mean.

786
00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:14.000
Um,
can you read that gene?
It says,

787
00:51:14.001 --> 00:51:18.470
Hey Hitler's after living through the Hashtag Thomas Fat Burdis fat era.

788
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:22.970
I've admitted that I too am fat.
I have been as Chris Jeans,

789
00:51:22.971 --> 00:51:25.520
I would say making fitness regularly.

790
00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:30.040
So as an act of self bribery.
Sorry.
Oh,
Jean.

791
00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:36.200
Oh,
it's a Ellis says now.
Oh,
very cute.

792
00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:40.340
Okay.
As an act of self bribery and motivation,

793
00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:43.700
if I go to the gym and make fitness every day in a month,

794
00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:47.000
I am rewarded with a new podcast tee shirt.

795
00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:52.490
May was my first month and I have ordered my brand new Stan on my shirt.

796
00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:57.650
I look forward to sweating through it like a monster in seven to 10 ish days.

797
00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:02.550
Thanks Mommy's for keeping my humor in the toilet and my spirits high as fuck.

798
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:07.910
Shout out to my main genes,
Mike.
Pop holding it down.
Also,
Tina,

799
00:52:07.911 --> 00:52:11.150
please come to Philly.
I've seen Tommy and burnt and helium.

800
00:52:11.151 --> 00:52:15.560
I need some east coast mainest money.
Love wishing you both fours.
Sarah,

801
00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:19.340
thank you.
Sad and good for you,
Sarah,
that you're working on your fitness.

802
00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:24.770
That's Amaz.
We've gotten people always weigh in.
They tell us like,
oh,

803
00:52:24.771 --> 00:52:28.730
I wish this.
I wish you did that.
With regard to shirts,

804
00:52:28.731 --> 00:52:33.050
one of the things we've heard a lot is I wish you had something for summer and I

805
00:52:33.051 --> 00:52:37.880
wish you had something for fitness.
Right?
And so we paid attention to it.

806
00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:41.120
And now we have a new fitness shirt.

807
00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:45.240
It's a summertime kind of fitness shirt and that it is a,

808
00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:47.830
a tank top.
Um,

809
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:53.240
that is a little picture.
So I'll see if I can bring up a bigger version of it.

810
00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:56.870
But basically,
um,
it is a tank top.

811
00:52:56.900 --> 00:53:01.900
It says I'm making fitness and it has an actual fitness dude making a kicky foot

812
00:53:05.031 --> 00:53:06.020
on its kicky flooding.

813
00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:10.160
We also did a women's version because people sometimes say like,
Oh,

814
00:53:10.161 --> 00:53:10.990
you only have men.

815
00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:15.990
So it says I'm making fitness just like an eastern block or would say,

816
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.730
yes,
your mom's house underneath it.
And this guy's kicky footing allowed them.

817
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:25.470
So making fitness tried to make it so that you can wear it to make fitness in

818
00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:28.420
order to the gym,
but you can also wear it,
uh,

819
00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:32.190
because it's about to be hot as fuck outside.

820
00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:37.440
And so this one,
I wonder why you can't just,
you,
you look great.
Let me see.
Oh,

821
00:53:37.441 --> 00:53:41.880
there I am.
You're making your fitness gene here.
I did it in jeans too.
Uh,

822
00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:47.180
so you could see how a real communist would work out in my tank top doing the

823
00:53:49.471 --> 00:53:52.470
heck squat dead lift.
Um,
by the way,

824
00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:55.830
super easy to lift that amount of weight for me.
Okay.
It's true.

825
00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.890
<v 5>This may gain fitness making fit.
Nike fitness</v>

826
00:54:00.830 --> 00:54:04.600
<v 3>go to a,
if you go to Tom cigarette.com and you click on the</v>

827
00:54:04.930 --> 00:54:09.540
<v 5>door,
you know,
that's kind of a German thing my grandmother used to say,
uh,</v>

828
00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:12.660
making stuff like when you're not supposed to,
like when you,

829
00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:15.870
when you make backups.
Yeah.
When you're making vegging up and you're like,

830
00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:20.140
you don't have to make it.
And I guess in German,
you know,
they say you make yeah,

831
00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:23.670
when I stand up in the morning,
like,
no,
you get up.

832
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:28.180
<v 3>Also.
Do you remember standing so crazy?
Remember last week,
uh,</v>

833
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.250
we played this.

834
00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:30.850
<v 11>Thank you.
She said,
yeah,</v>

835
00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:33.370
no one celebrates getting together with someone and get married,

836
00:54:33.730 --> 00:54:37.720
but there's no milestone in society that celebrates escaping something awful.

837
00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:41.880
Now it's called happiness and contentment is just called live in a good light.

838
00:54:41.890 --> 00:54:46.090
Right?
Because some people are Erica Anderson,
who of course lives in Brooklyn.

839
00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:47.590
Also married herself.

840
00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:51.100
Scilog it's hard not to adopt whatever societies messages are.

841
00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:55.620
<v 3>So that was last week.
Well,
hey mommy's,</v>

842
00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:58.750
I heard you guys talking about slog.
It reminded me of this girl at my,

843
00:54:58.790 --> 00:55:02.430
my girlfriend was telling me about she has a parttime makeup artists.

844
00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:05.670
Anytime she and my girl work together,
she comes home,

845
00:55:05.730 --> 00:55:09.030
mentally drained this lunatic.

846
00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:13.710
Apparently Mary's herself yearly.
No,
it's very expensive.

847
00:55:13.711 --> 00:55:14.131
Retreat.

848
00:55:14.131 --> 00:55:19.131
She goes on and her and her sisters marry themselves in some groups ceremony.

849
00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:23.280
This girl does not have any friends and my girl feels bad for her,

850
00:55:23.281 --> 00:55:27.450
so she listens to her when she goes on these hour long rants about how terrible

851
00:55:27.451 --> 00:55:32.280
her life is.
She's a good looking girl,
but completely bat shit crazy.
Yeah.

852
00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:37.440
Love the podcast,
Anton.
Um,
that's why,
cause she's fucking crazy.

853
00:55:37.441 --> 00:55:41.370
Exactly.
Yeah.
And that's why you marry yourself or you're,

854
00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:44.760
nobody wants to marry you because your mom and you are the only two that thank

855
00:55:44.761 --> 00:55:46.200
you,
Mary for material.

856
00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:49.870
<v 5>Yeah.
She and she's bitching bitches about her life.
So that's what he's saying,</v>

857
00:55:49.871 --> 00:55:54.140
that she's in fucking unhappy Twat.
Yeah.
It's so narcissistic to,
to,
uh,

858
00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:58.480
I'm gonna marry myself and to make this better,
to make people attend that,
oh,

859
00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:01.420
you should do that in silence.
You should go,

860
00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:05.390
you should go out in the woods and be like,
yeah,
this tree married me to myself.

861
00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.800
That's it.
There's the don't,
don't have everybody come to that.

862
00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:11.680
You should be ashamed and,
and have the healthy amount of shame attached to that.

863
00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:16.690
Real crazy.
I mean,
isn't life about giving to other people?
Yeah.
To your husband,

864
00:56:16.691 --> 00:56:20.620
to your wife,
to your kids,
to your dogs or your cats,
whatever.
Yeah.

865
00:56:20.650 --> 00:56:24.100
It's about giving,
not taking you.
Fuck.
We also

866
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:27.790
<v 3>last week,
it's a fucking crazy fuck it.
Don't marry yourself.</v>

867
00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:31.380
Just keep fucking fucking people till you find the one you like,

868
00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:32.513
<v 5>you know,
and that,</v>

869
00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:34.920
the problem is they don't want to get their lives and don't want to go to

870
00:56:34.921 --> 00:56:37.990
therapy to figure out why they're so miserable and instead they go,

871
00:56:37.991 --> 00:56:41.970
but I'm a strong woman.
Nobody can handle me.
I'm so strong,
like no booboo.

872
00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:44.430
Interesting accent.
Hmm.

873
00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:47.790
<v 3>They handle me.
There's this,
okay.
I'll tell you why.</v>

874
00:56:47.970 --> 00:56:52.410
There's a girl on Instagram and this black girl I follow and she's always

875
00:56:52.411 --> 00:56:54.060
posting that I like her post,

876
00:56:54.061 --> 00:56:56.640
but she's always complaining that men don't lagger cause she's so strong.

877
00:56:56.650 --> 00:57:00.350
That's because you're coming across kind of shitty.
Yeah.
Out of your mind.
Yeah.

878
00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:05.310
Last week we also discussed,
we showed you shacks,
horrendous.

879
00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:12.210
His size,
22 demon foot and that was fun.

880
00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:15.810
Uh,
you also brought up is a triple d sluts since he's got,

881
00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:18.630
well he's divorced 22 feet,
so I dunno,

882
00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:22.590
he's divorced but he's out there.
He plays the field and he was a good time.

883
00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:23.700
He said girlfriends,

884
00:57:24.090 --> 00:57:29.090
but it also brought about the discussion that I'm maybe shacks Dong.

885
00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:34.770
There's cause there's been stories,
you know,
um,
there's been stories that,

886
00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:37.170
not that it's like a,
you know,

887
00:57:37.171 --> 00:57:40.980
a baby dick just for being on a giant.
Right.

888
00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:45.360
It might not be in proportion worries about this.
Really.
Yeah.

889
00:57:45.361 --> 00:57:48.030
People I've heard room,
like I've heard everything from like,

890
00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:49.860
it is really small to like,

891
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:55.230
I actually got to sports reporters that I know texted me this week and they

892
00:57:58.141 --> 00:58:01.020
said,
hey man,
I was listening to the podcast.

893
00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:06.350
I've seen Shaq naked multiple times and it is not small.

894
00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.850
They're like,
no,
it's not small at all.
Yeah.
Well that's good.

895
00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:14.370
I trust the sports reporter.
Oh,
I trust them over anyone.

896
00:58:14.371 --> 00:58:18.400
But we did get this email.
Um,
oh,
how funny.
This is fun.

897
00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:23.340
I love to see Shaq stick.
Yeah,
I wouldn't shoot.
I'm so curious.
Of course.

898
00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:28.020
Um,
a few people,
I'd like to see their dicks.
Oh,
there's a lot of people.

899
00:58:28.021 --> 00:58:31.920
I want to see their dicks.
Who Do you want to see besides most people?
Me Too.

900
00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:33.960
I feel like I'd like to see people make it.

901
00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:37.740
I think I'd like to see their genitals.
Yeah,
I think,
I dunno,
you kind of,

902
00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:41.610
but you know what's funny is that any way that it comes across,

903
00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:45.810
you're going to have another words.
Let's see.
You see somebody,
you're like,

904
00:58:45.811 --> 00:58:50.070
I've always wanted to see this person's Dick or naked and they're super

905
00:58:50.071 --> 00:58:53.130
confident and they got a big Dick.
You're like,
you're like,
you're,

906
00:58:53.131 --> 00:58:56.070
you'll tie it and you'll go,
oh,
well that's why he's so confident.

907
00:58:56.520 --> 00:59:00.660
But then the same guy,
it can be super confident with a little one.
And it's like,

908
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:04.230
I dunno does,
if it's little,
you go,
that's weird.
He's confident,

909
00:59:04.231 --> 00:59:07.530
but he's not like,
it's still goes one way or the other.
Right?

910
00:59:07.531 --> 00:59:10.350
Like you don't really first now and he's not an indicator,

911
00:59:10.351 --> 00:59:12.900
it's not going to really,
I think you make it,

912
00:59:13.290 --> 00:59:14.900
you make the assumption that it's the [inaudible] here,

913
00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:17.750
but I don't know that it necessarily is.
That's my point here.
Yeah.

914
00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:23.210
I feel like I can tell what a girl's vagina will like based on her face and her

915
00:59:23.211 --> 00:59:26.210
build.
Like I can be like,
aw,
that's just like a,
hang on.

916
00:59:26.211 --> 00:59:29.660
I can tell you that confidence thing is not necessarily tied to that to dick

917
00:59:29.661 --> 00:59:32.900
size.
Awesome.
Insecure guys.
It's true.
It's true.

918
00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:37.810
Because I've known both ways.
Yeah.
It's not,
it's not,
it's not full spectrum.

919
00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:42.680
Big Puerto Rican hogs.
Those guys are full of confidence.
But a,

920
00:59:42.690 --> 00:59:46.010
it's not correlated to confidence.
No,
no.

921
00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:50.840
Because I've known guys that had the larger and they're totally we and totally

922
00:59:50.841 --> 00:59:55.460
sad.
And then I know guys are small painters who are the most delightful,

923
00:59:55.670 --> 01:00:00.470
confident,
uh,
caring.
How do you know about fashion?
Penis?
So many.
So many,

924
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:04.790
so many.
So you're saying that you've been with a guy,
the spectrum,

925
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:07.940
but you've been with guys that had big ones that were not competent.
Yes.

926
01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:11.810
That's actually the least confident of my boyfriends.

927
01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:16.700
The one who had the most emotional problems had a pretty girthy one on him.

928
01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:19.770
Really?
And you would never guess.
Yeah.
See,
I don't feel,

929
01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:24.360
I don't find that now that I know things now that that's shocking.
You know,

930
01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:26.780
I'm saying I don't,
it's not that shocking.
Yeah.

931
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:30.680
Well cause there's other things that go into somebody's personality and you
know,

932
01:00:30.681 --> 01:00:33.800
they could have a childhood thing and it's really how you're raised.

933
01:00:33.801 --> 01:00:35.990
I think the ridiculed for their girthy penis,

934
01:00:37.310 --> 01:00:41.630
I just think there's more than a guy's penile size that determines his
emotional,

935
01:00:41.631 --> 01:00:46.200
mental personality.
Here's an email about Shaq's.
Okay.
Um,

936
01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:50.210
this thing is operating really slowed and I wish we could see people naked.

937
01:00:50.211 --> 01:00:54.530
Is there an app or you can like,
you can guess what they look like naked maybe.

938
01:00:56.330 --> 01:00:59.450
Hey,
genes originally heard a story about Shaq and his hog.

939
01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:04.840
Someone I know was at a urinal and none other than Shaq diesel himself walked up

940
01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:09.490
and stood next to him.
Her,
please don't you shoot down.

941
01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:14.360
Couldn't help but look over it to witness what he thought was going to be a

942
01:01:14.361 --> 01:01:18.410
black iguana hanging there.
And to his surprise,

943
01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:23.210
it was a very average size pener shack caught him,

944
01:01:23.211 --> 01:01:25.910
her looking and said crazy,
right.

945
01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:30.530
Huge big words,
right.
Called himself.

946
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:35.150
Huge big word with a tiny dick.
In other words,
he made light of it.

947
01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:39.950
An average Dick on a monster.
Definitely.
It looks miniscule.

948
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:44.600
Keep 'em high and tight and get and get a hand job from your grandpa and a

949
01:01:44.601 --> 01:01:49.190
Ferris wheel and fuck purified water slugged Sam.
Thanks Sam.

950
01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:53.930
So I think,
but I think that's where the rumors that I heard first came from,

951
01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:55.700
it's never that his was tiny,

952
01:01:56.270 --> 01:02:01.270
is that he's a legit gigantic human being with a regular size pener.

953
01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:05.810
Maybe it's not even regular.
Maybe it's definitely above regular,

954
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:07.910
but that it's on a monster.

955
01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:13.090
He's seven one and in his retirement,
wait,
he's probably three 40 that's correct.

956
01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:17.630
I mean that's,
that's a guy that his head is probably near those lights up there,

957
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:22.110
you know,
and his,
his is,
it's,
he's more than the width of that.

958
01:02:22.111 --> 01:02:26.700
Doorframe so somebody like that,
you're like,
oh my God.
I mean it's,

959
01:02:26.701 --> 01:02:31.560
it should look like a fucking like one of these poles posts right here,
you know?

960
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:36.120
So that's what I think it comes from.
Well Shakeel if you're listening,

961
01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:39.030
if you'd go ahead and send us a picture of your Dick,
that'd be great.

962
01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:42.060
He would show it to you in person.
I'm sure.
Just come over and show us your Dick.

963
01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.520
I don't know if he'd do that,
but I think if you were to track him down,

964
01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:49.740
he has an la residents,
but he lives primarily in Florida.
Okay.

965
01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:54.420
We'll just fly over and show us your Dick.
Nope,
there you heard it back.

966
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:59.700
Hopefully we can never knew Dick,
many famous people listened to our show.

967
01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:03.470
That's true.
Shakeel could be listening right now.
If I see that,
then I'd be like,

968
01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:06.790
<v 12>[inaudible]</v>

969
01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:10.550
<v 3>what does,
I'm going to set it off.</v>

970
01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:16.250
Um,
this I got,
oh my God,
this,

971
01:03:16.610 --> 01:03:18.230
I can't help.
But,

972
01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:22.100
but just almost weep when I see things like this,

973
01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:27.080
and this is where I'm the biggest advocate for ending your own life,

974
01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:29.180
is when I see things like this

975
01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:36.130
<v 12>[inaudible].</v>

976
01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:54.080
<v 3>This is a roll call.</v>

977
01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:59.500
Get some job orientation where you're supposed to say your name and you say like

978
01:04:00.681 --> 01:04:03.400
what your interests are and you have to do it while you're clapping and

979
01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:08.170
screaming.
I'm out,
I think,
right?
Then I stand up.
This is what white people do.

980
01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:12.500
Right?
Then I'd be like,
quit.
Even if you were texting me like,

981
01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:16.220
the baby needs diapers.
There's no food at home.
I'd be like,

982
01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:19.280
I'm going to go rob somebody right now.

983
01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:22.550
I think this is why we dropped out of the system.
It's pretty,

984
01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:26.300
it's exactly meetings like this that a team building things,

985
01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:30.140
God did clapping it.
The quarterly earnings,
listen,
oh my God,

986
01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:33.890
blow my fucking brains out.
Or the worst is like somebody wrote,

987
01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:37.040
what would you do if you were a in the audience,

988
01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:40.940
if you were forced to do a Shaboo IA roll call.

989
01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:45.560
I go to the bathroom and hide like I have diarrhea.
I can't do this.

990
01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:47.680
Shibuya rollcall.
Ooh,
yeah.

991
01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:52.130
I remember like team building days where they'd make you do like trust falls and

992
01:04:52.131 --> 01:04:55.880
all those things are they do they love that team thing?
Man,

993
01:04:56.730 --> 01:04:59.840
it's so demeaning.
Can't you just pay me my check and let me go home?

994
01:04:59.841 --> 01:05:03.140
I know a couple people that work at whole foods and it's all about the team.

995
01:05:03.141 --> 01:05:07.460
That team,
a team leader will be here later.
I had some question for the guy.

996
01:05:07.461 --> 01:05:09.800
He goes,
well,
our team leader will be here in a little bit,
and I was like,

997
01:05:09.801 --> 01:05:12.980
who the fuck's your team leader while he's the general manager?
Yeah.
Okay.

998
01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:18.160
It's a fancy word for general manager.
You're not a team.
This is not a fun

999
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:22.150
<v 7>thing.
Team implies fun that we're all going to be playing a sport later.</v>

1000
01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:23.940
That's the psychology of it,
right?

1001
01:05:23.970 --> 01:05:27.010
Make you think you're fine fun and there were all in this together.

1002
01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:29.810
We're all equal.
There's no hierarchy.
Yeah,
right.

1003
01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:34.080
There's this little hierarchy where the CEO gets stock options,
but yeah,

1004
01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:36.830
but you get minimum wage.
It's cool.
Right?
But you're a team.

1005
01:05:37.690 --> 01:05:39.810
We're all part of the team.
She gets to wear jeans.

1006
01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:43.890
<v 12>All right,
Bri and Chelsea so far.</v>

1007
01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:53.000
<v 7>Oh my.
Fuck.
I mean,
this guy,</v>

1008
01:05:53.001 --> 01:05:55.570
I feel like I can see him smiling.
I don't even know how you're smiling.

1009
01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:58.430
It's all dudes that are like,
oh boy,
do I have to really do this?

1010
01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:02.270
I think they're things that they're getting a watch cute girls and they're like,

1011
01:06:02.271 --> 01:06:06.380
oh,
cool.
Right?
And they're like,
no,
no,
you're participating in this now.
Oh my God,

1012
01:06:06.381 --> 01:06:10.950
you're going to do this
pirates.

1013
01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:12.453
That's what they're doing.

1014
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:17.710
<v 12>[inaudible] this is so embarrassing.</v>

1015
01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:26.510
Oh,
this is price Waterhouse Cooper.

1016
01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:37.690
<v 7>Oh my God.
This is a big company.
This is terrible.</v>

1017
01:06:38.410 --> 01:06:42.100
Like how depressing it is to under these horrible neon lights.
You know,

1018
01:06:42.101 --> 01:06:46.060
these depressing office lights.
You know what I mean?

1019
01:06:46.061 --> 01:06:48.100
Isn't work hard enough for people?
Like,

1020
01:06:48.101 --> 01:06:52.390
isn't it enough that you have to wake up every morning traffic,
uh,

1021
01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:56.470
sit there,
work hard,
sit in traffic,
go home,
do it again five days a week,

1022
01:06:56.590 --> 01:07:00.310
and then they have to demean you with these fucking meetings and make you sing

1023
01:07:00.311 --> 01:07:05.230
like a donkey.
It's demeaning.
Let these people just do their job and go home.

1024
01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:10.120
Why do you have to fuck with them?
Have some respect.
My name is Tom.

1025
01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:12.910
Yeah.
Yeah,
to shit.
Yeah.

1026
01:07:14.350 --> 01:07:18.420
Shrimp last night.
Yeah.
It's going to come out my day.

1027
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:20.360
<v 12>Yeah.</v>

1028
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:27.720
<v 7>My name is Kristen &lt;UNK&gt;.
Great job.</v>

1029
01:07:27.850 --> 01:07:31.050
I got tickets go down to my knees.

1030
01:07:32.130 --> 01:07:35.940
I like to share.
Yeah,
I liked his knees.

1031
01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:39.240
What do you say?
It's so dumb.
What are you getting?
What are you going to share?

1032
01:07:39.241 --> 01:07:42.830
Like your intimate,
I know.
That's what people like.
Baseball.

1033
01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:48.060
I like to dance.
Give me a chance.
I was so fucking

1034
01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:50.773
<v 12>okay.</v>

1035
01:07:51.830 --> 01:07:55.960
<v 7>I like to Fart.
Yeah.
And smell it too.
Yeah.</v>

1036
01:07:56.420 --> 01:08:01.190
I cut my farts and the shower was Tom.
Yeah,

1037
01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:05.990
this is a can
I'll say at once.

1038
01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:10.570
Yeah.
And then they just stopped clapping and they're like,

1039
01:08:10.590 --> 01:08:14.770
I'm sorry.
What did he want you to fuck me in my ass,
man.

1040
01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:16.040
I just end

1041
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.920
<v 3>the whole thing and they're like,
hey,
you gotta get out of here.
You're fired.</v>

1042
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:21.110
You're fired.
I thought it was my first day.

1043
01:08:23.650 --> 01:08:27.890
She boom.
What a fucking,
I hate stuff like that.

1044
01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:32.660
Shaboo yeah,
it's really fucking nightmare.
I don't know.
I'm

1045
01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:35.270
really slow today.

1046
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:41.090
When you click on myself in the shower.
Yeah.

1047
01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:43.650
I spread my butt cheeks.
I fry.

1048
01:08:44.850 --> 01:08:46.900
<v 7>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1049
01:08:51.830 --> 01:08:55.340
I spread my butt cheeks.
Oh wipe it hard.

1050
01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:58.880
I shit on a day.
I push it

1051
01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:01.790
like a tart.

1052
01:09:07.170 --> 01:09:10.230
<v 3>My name is Tom.
I'm fucking,</v>

1053
01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:13.920
I'm proud to have come out as polyamorous and now I'm excited to share with
that.

1054
01:09:13.921 --> 01:09:17.660
I'm bisexual
tall.
Oh,

1055
01:09:17.690 --> 01:09:22.590
that'd be great if he's like I'm Paulien by,
what did he say?

1056
01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:28.070
I'm mostly nonbinary.
Yeah,
your Pronoun.

1057
01:09:28.110 --> 01:09:32.310
You could just ruin like if you had a bunch of people and they were queued up to

1058
01:09:32.311 --> 01:09:35.850
say fucked up thing,
you could ruin their whole thing.
They would.

1059
01:09:35.851 --> 01:09:37.020
That would be fantastic.

1060
01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:41.250
That'd be the only way to get through this and corporate oppression.
Hi,

1061
01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:46.290
my name is Tom.
I like fun times.
Yeah,

1062
01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:49.230

Okay.
Okay.

1067
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:13.710
You did that.

1068
01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:19.550
They wouldn't be able to throw you out.
They'd have to like respect,

1069
01:10:20.150 --> 01:10:23.010
respect your pronouns or they have to respect your pronoun and also like if you

1070
01:10:23.011 --> 01:10:25.950
were like,
yeah,
I'm really going on this.
Come strike.

1071
01:10:25.951 --> 01:10:28.290
They'd have to go like Jesus Christ.
Like we can't,

1072
01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:32.990
we can't fire her because there'd be a lawsuit.
Oh yeah.
Any fun?

1073
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:35.160
I know how everybody's so fucking,

1074
01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:41.850
I like blue.
It was one more thing.

1075
01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:46.710
I don't like Jews.
Uh,
hey guys,

1076
01:10:46.711 --> 01:10:51.390
why'd you stop clapping?
Hello.
And they're like,

1077
01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:55.830
um,
cause that one they'd fire you for and then you're like,

1078
01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:58.920

I could be bigger.

1079
01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:02.520
Uh Yup.
God Damn.

1080
01:11:02.530 --> 01:11:05.340
I don't like go ahead.

1081
01:11:05.490 --> 01:11:09.850
I'm not saying it remix in it.
Next week.
Song you can use.

1082
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:13.980
There's all kind that you have said before.
I can't do that.

1083
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:18.160
<v 7>How come?
Because there's too many out there of me saying it.
There's too many.
No,</v>

1084
01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:22.170
there's not.
No there's not.
There's too many.
What are you talking about?

1085
01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:26.780
Go for it.
No,

No,

Go for it.
Go for it.

1086
01:11:27.390 --> 01:11:31.980
Go for it.
No Way.
She didn't say that.
Go for is too sweet.

1087
01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:42.370
Nicolette.

1088
01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:54.020
I couldn't believe it.
She was saying that I really in my brain,
I was like,

1089
01:11:54.021 --> 01:11:57.140
it's Nicholas.
There's no way anybody can say what she's saying.

1090
01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:08.300
Hey Hitler.
I wonder how dany acts are doing.

1091
01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:12.230
I want to it like we got to look.
Got to find her.
See what she's doing.

1092
01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:17.000
I don't know what she's doing.
Hey Hitler.

1093
01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:18.770
Nathaniel.

1094
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:24.330
Actually I want,
I had the place I want to share.

1095
01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:28.550
It is not on your map around in,
in your mouth.

1096
01:12:28.551 --> 01:12:31.700
This is what I was looking for.
This is what I was looking for here.

1097
01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:33.710
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

1098
01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:39.220
<v 7>that was the original.
That was the original depressing corporate fun.</v>

1099
01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:42.430
God,
I was terrible.
That was crazy.
That was the word.

1100
01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:48.310
Sharing the things you like.
Yes.
I love it this way.

1101
01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:53.440
It's is the worst work orientation at a big

1102
01:12:58.010 --> 01:13:01.510
corporate retreat showing you things you like,

1103
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:07.010
<v 2>man.
Some photos</v>

1104
01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:11.660
I can not kids someday.

1105
01:13:22.170 --> 01:13:23.003
Ready.

1106
01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:37.293
<v 7>Social.</v>

1107
01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:48.020
<v 2>Good job guys.</v>

1108
01:14:02.230 --> 01:14:04.670
Just searching for the story

1109
01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:16.750
we posted soon that grab the ground.
Nobody calls it

1110
01:14:29.170 --> 01:14:30.003
social.

1111
01:14:42.050 --> 01:14:46.070
<v 7>That's the guy that wrote it.
That guy.
The other guy.
Yeah.
He takes full credit.</v>

1112
01:14:46.071 --> 01:14:48.020
Remember in the beginning I wrote,
this

1113
01:14:57.250 --> 01:15:02.080
<v 4>doesn't work here.
Everybody line up.</v>

1114
01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:11.850
I feel like this is how blue band got hired.
This was his hazing.

1115
01:15:19.810 --> 01:15:23.980
<v 7>Okay.
Would you rather be in that room smelling all those smells?</v>

1116
01:15:25.050 --> 01:15:26.230
You don't have to fuck anybody,

1117
01:15:26.231 --> 01:15:30.610
but that's your orientation is watching guys fuck each other and you smell it or

1118
01:15:30.611 --> 01:15:35.320
it's the Shibuya orientation.
Oh fuck.
I'll be real.
Think about this.

1119
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:39.460
So either be in a boot hockey room and you just,
you're close.

1120
01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:41.920
How close are you?
You're right in the mix.

1121
01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:44.720
You're this close to guys fucking and sucking and ground.

1122
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:47.860
You're not participating.
You don't have to,
it's an orientation to work.

1123
01:15:47.861 --> 01:15:50.830
You're going to start working at this company and this is what they sell and

1124
01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:51.461
these videos,

1125
01:15:51.461 --> 01:15:53.890
but they want you to be familiar with the products and you know how to sit

1126
01:15:53.891 --> 01:15:58.390
through a live filming or,
or it's the Shibuya Song.
When you work at,

1127
01:15:58.690 --> 01:16:02.840
you know this company and you got to fucking do the roll call.
Here's my

1128
01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:07.130
<v 4>definitely</v>

1129
01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:11.380
<v 7>watch that.
Definitely I would watch guys but fucking shitting on each other,</v>

1130
01:16:11.450 --> 01:16:14.060
smearing the shit on their face.
Like,
Hey,

1131
01:16:14.061 --> 01:16:17.570
my name is Kaylee and I like a good time.
No,
fuck that.

1132
01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:20.690
I like the cubs.
Wow.
Kaylee,

1133
01:16:20.691 --> 01:16:24.440
you really dug deep on that for all of us to get to do that.

1134
01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:30.410
They never share anything truly interesting either.
It's all surface level.

1135
01:16:30.411 --> 01:16:34.900
Like I like the color blue,
like everybody does dip shit.
So the,

1136
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:39.530
I know it's fucking so stupid.
One of the,
uh,
what do you masturbate to Kylie?

1137
01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:39.741
Like,

1138
01:16:39.741 --> 01:16:44.741
let's hear that you remember we watched one of the origins of getting Dan Pena

1139
01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:50.300
or world,
it was finding him on these interviews and talking about like,

1140
01:16:50.301 --> 01:16:52.300
I'm not a cunt.
You're a cunt.
Brian.
Brian,

1141
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:57.200
while you're fucking poor Brian,
that guy has a show.

1142
01:16:57.201 --> 01:17:01.910
I think it's called London real.
Yes.
And he had on this sexual,

1143
01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:06.750
um,
I dunno,
the tantric kind of teacher.
Yeah.

1144
01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:10.340
And so I haven't seen this yet,
but there's clips of this guy

1145
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:15.440
<v 3>breaking down.
What's that?
You're very handsome.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.</v>

1146
01:17:15.441 --> 01:17:19.790
Very beautiful.
I like you too.
Sure.
Maybe we can come to us.

1147
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.540
Why don't we practice with this guy teaches?
I have no idea.

1148
01:17:22.541 --> 01:17:24.710
I really have no idea what you're talking about.
That's good.

1149
01:17:26.110 --> 01:17:30.870
<v 7>And tell them,
so the women practice on the egg.
What did the men do?
The men,</v>

1150
01:17:30.871 --> 01:17:33.650
the first thing they have to practicing,

1151
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:36.980
they would call sharpening the knife.

1152
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:41.860
I have an idea of what I think I know.
Okay.
So the whole key is less simple.

1153
01:17:41.861 --> 01:17:45.590
You get an oil.
We caught the baby oil,
baby oil,

1154
01:17:46.150 --> 01:17:51.140
put it in and now you put the peanuts to warm up in the cold winter.

1155
01:17:51.141 --> 01:17:52.130
You warm them up,

1156
01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:57.340
you get a hot towel and you make it a warm and you put here,

1157
01:17:57.980 --> 01:17:59.360
make sure all the blood flow.

1158
01:18:00.010 --> 01:18:05.000
<v 3>Okay.
Oh so far I like,
I like what he's going with so far.</v>

1159
01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:09.410
He's putting a hot towel on his painter,
which is great.
Warm up,
warm.

1160
01:18:09.411 --> 01:18:12.200
It's a warm towel.
Not a hot.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,
okay.
You want to burn?

1161
01:18:12.201 --> 01:18:13.070
Get some blood in there.

1162
01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:17.030
<v 7>Now you get the penis out.
Yeah,
you pull the skin.
A lot of people,</v>

1163
01:18:17.031 --> 01:18:20.050
they never succumb.
Census.
Certainly hundreds of cans.

1164
01:18:20.130 --> 01:18:23.670
So you pulled the skin and you get the oil in the hand and your right hand go

1165
01:18:23.671 --> 01:18:26.540
like this to rob,
Rob,
rob,
rob,

1166
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:31.000
especially on the Klan Penis.
Rub them throwing at the time.

1167
01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:32.990
Ras 50 Times.

1168
01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:36.470
You make them strong and not sensitive.

1169
01:18:38.930 --> 01:18:39.763
Okay,

1170
01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:44.250
<v 3>so you're,
you said the glands,
which is near the tippy top.
You know right there,</v>

1171
01:18:44.251 --> 01:18:46.650
that right below the tippy top,
that's your glands,

1172
01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:50.580
<v 7>right?
Did the time once one left,
right side,</v>

1173
01:18:51.370 --> 01:18:55.810
left side.
If you're town from 50 time,
bet 50 Tom down.

1174
01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:59.440
I love that.
He keeps,
how sure am I doing this?

1175
01:18:59.530 --> 01:19:03.550
You have to do every day until you can control every day.

1176
01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:07.290
<v 3>Oh,
every day.
I don't think anybody can read themselves that much without</v>

1177
01:19:09.650 --> 01:19:13.670
<v 7>sharpening the knife.
Argued on traveling the night.</v>

1178
01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:16.190
That's the number one.
Number two,

1179
01:19:16.670 --> 01:19:21.470
you have to learn how to contracting the prostate gland.
Oh,

1180
01:19:21.471 --> 01:19:22.304
Jesus.

1181
01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:27.090
<v 3>Learn to contract your prostate gland
fucking thing.</v>

1182
01:19:27.091 --> 01:19:30.960
I have a feeling it's going to be gruesome.
Um,
you want me to start doing this?

1183
01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:36.570
I know.
I don't think you can control yourself.
50 50.

1184
01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:41.430
That's like 200 strokes on that thing and nothing happens.
No Way.
No Way.

1185
01:19:41.431 --> 01:19:42.530
It's not possible,
dude.

1186
01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:47.530
<v 7>No,
the end,
this is different thing.
Okay.
So people cannot separate and they,</v>

1187
01:19:47.531 --> 01:19:48.820
they,
they don't know what the square on the,

1188
01:19:48.821 --> 01:19:52.370
and they just don't work because they're a new contract.
The prosthetist,

1189
01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:56.790
because male g spot is in prostate gland.

1190
01:19:57.260 --> 01:20:00.530
Right?
So when you contract the prostate gland in the front,

1191
01:20:01.010 --> 01:20:05.480
and you feel energy activate here,
so as you contract and you feel here accurate,

1192
01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:10.430
now you do it right.
Now,
would you have sex with this guy?
No.
No,

1193
01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:15.150
<v 3>but just because you know,
he knows so no,
nope.
Take away.</v>

1194
01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:20.490
Just listen.
Take away that like a mayor,
like just,
I'm just saying,

1195
01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:25.680
there's no,
uh,
marriage vows involved.
It's just like on a physical level.

1196
01:20:26.190 --> 01:20:29.010
This guy is a sex guru.

1197
01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:33.240
But what if you are promised,
listen,
one of your friends goes,

1198
01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:38.210
I was with Kim here and I,

1199
01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:43.230
I didn't know his name's Kim.
I don't,
I had an earth shattering orgasm.

1200
01:20:43.231 --> 01:20:47.650
Like I came to the point where I was just like,
I,
I,

1201
01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:49.810
I was screaming.
I had,
uh,

1202
01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:54.030
my leg kick through a wall and I wept for an hour.

1203
01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:57.930
It is the greatest feeling I've ever had in my life.
I can set you up with them,

1204
01:20:58.830 --> 01:20:59.640
would you?

1205
01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:02.220
<v 7>Here's why I'm going to decline.
I respectfully,</v>

1206
01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:05.010
because I can't get over this guy aesthetically.

1207
01:21:05.190 --> 01:21:07.320
Now you put him in Ryan Gosling's body.

1208
01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:10.260
<v 3>Yeah,
absolutely.
With no,
but that's the thing though,</v>

1209
01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:15.560
is what I'm saying is let's say somebody isn't to the eye a 10 and stunning to

1210
01:21:17.311 --> 01:21:20.340
you,
but they're,
their ability is through the roof.

1211
01:21:20.690 --> 01:21:23.120
<v 7>Yeah.
But for me,
sex is mental.</v>

1212
01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:27.140
So if I'm not mentally attracted,
physically attractive,

1213
01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:32.390
can't even get there to lay here close I cornrows or,
yeah,
I know.

1214
01:21:32.391 --> 01:21:35.920
He doesn't say it like,
that's fine.
He just says,
Hi

1215
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:41.480
Gaza.
I close.
I right,

1216
01:21:41.481 --> 01:21:45.150
so you have a little blind fold on.
And then he's just like,
Kinda like it.

1217
01:21:45.530 --> 01:21:48.860
I don't like it.
I can't believe you don't want this.
I don't like him.

1218
01:21:48.861 --> 01:21:52.190
I don't like the Vegan Vagina Guy.
I don't like,
I don't like creepers.

1219
01:21:52.191 --> 01:21:56.270
He's a creeper dude.
He's a nice guy.
He's not a nice guy.
Zach.
Alation,

1220
01:21:56.300 --> 01:22:00.710
the threshold of the declaration if I'm the prospect and contracting,

1221
01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:04.630
okay,
so I'm exercising far.

1222
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:09.440
People have prospect land stolen up a problem.
This one who solved the problem,

1223
01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:14.330
okay,
just need 312,
300 300 times.

1224
01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:17.180
These guys would just,
uh,
you know what they're called?
Mm.
Perverts.

1225
01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:21.050
I eat the ass and pussy all the time.
I got nothing.
They're perverts.

1226
01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:23.210
These are guys who like to jerk their cocks.
24,

1227
01:22:23.211 --> 01:22:26.300
seven and he jerks his dick so much that he thinks he's a guru.

1228
01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:29.660
He's an expert on a Dick Jagger.
Yes.

1229
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:33.700
All these people are just overly horn.
Now the question is for me,
what?

1230
01:22:33.710 --> 01:22:35.750
I led this Guy Jack my dick.
Yes,

1231
01:22:35.751 --> 01:22:40.160
because he's so good at it and the answer is a resoundingly yes.

1232
01:22:41.450 --> 01:22:44.360
Okay.
How about this?
Let's say it's a woman.
We put this guy,

1233
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:47.240
let's say it's him in,
but yeah,

1234
01:22:47.690 --> 01:22:51.290
it's like a old ass woman.
It's like that.
What'd you marry your mom?
Mom.

1235
01:22:51.410 --> 01:22:54.310
That's the lady who's got to give you a hand job.
What'd you marry?

1236
01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:58.840
<v 3>Oh,
right,
right.
It's her.
If,
if I'm being told this is the greatest thing ever.</v>

1237
01:22:58.870 --> 01:23:03.610
Sure,
sure it wouldn't,
she wouldn't bother you?
No,
not rapping.

1238
01:23:04.090 --> 01:23:06.160
I mean if I'm at her.
Yeah,

1239
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:10.730
<v 7>but what if she's just like,
you lay here,
you know he's,
and he cut,</v>

1240
01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:14.410

1241
01:23:14.411 --> 01:23:18.370

1242
01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:20.970
I dunno if he's known as the top.

1243
01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:32.210
I think I would.
I would think so.
I think it'd be awesome.

1244
01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:37.870
It was fucking tight places you want to stress.

1245
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:44.410
How much do you hate it when they stretch?
You hate it.
Stop stretching me.

1246
01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:46.360
It's the least relaxing thing.

1247
01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:50.100
They also forget cause sometimes if I go I'll be like,
hey,
uh,

1248
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:54.280
no stretching and they go,
no stretching.
No,
I don't want to be stretched.

1249
01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:59.500
And then the can't believe it.
30 minutes in there's a like my legs move.
I go,

1250
01:23:59.501 --> 01:24:04.150
hey,
hey.
And they're like,
ah,
yeah,
no stretching.
I hate that.
And you know what?

1251
01:24:04.151 --> 01:24:06.310
I also hate when they crack your knuckles,

1252
01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:10.120
when they pull your fucking fingers out of the joints.
Like,
dude,
stop,
stop.

1253
01:24:10.150 --> 01:24:14.630
That doesn't feel good.
Or they pull your toes and everything off.

1254
01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:20.480
Awesome.
And now you're doing it until you feel awesome.
Okay,

1255
01:24:20.481 --> 01:24:24.770
I'm going to feel ops all guests him without.
Okay.

1256
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:28.630
Oh yeah.
Okay.
So you feel,

1257
01:24:28.670 --> 01:24:32.070
when you watch the saying is very quick to two times again

1258
01:24:36.290 --> 01:24:38.930
when you squeeze,

1259
01:24:40.170 --> 01:24:44.260
How do you even watch this guy?

1260
01:24:49.470 --> 01:24:51.900
And now you do it.

01:24:54.690 --> 01:24:58.500

Please don't make me watch.

1262
01:24:58.501 --> 01:25:02.430
So you feel so you see when you do,
when you get it,

1263
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:06.870

1266
01:25:26.810 --> 01:25:30.360
when you squeeze this all guests.

1267
01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:35.040
I pictured the two.
Yeah.
When he does that I picked for him.

1268
01:25:35.041 --> 01:25:39.440
Go ahead and you like,

Yoda motherfucker.
You

1271
01:25:53.190 --> 01:25:54.670
imagine hearing that sound like

1272
01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:58.920
that's what you're telling when you're with them though.

1273
01:25:59.310 --> 01:26:04.160
That's what you're going to hear.
I know rob.
Rob.
Yes.
What he's doing,

1274
01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:06.673
Tom?
Yeah.

1275
01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:08.840
<v 0>Rob.
Rob Ruff.</v>

1276
01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:17.690
<v 7>What if he just comes and then you're like,
what about me?
No,
I'm done.</v>

1277
01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:23.320
He's like Ukraine to the on the penis.
Throw up.
Yeah.

1278
01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:25.940
What if you had to get a massage and he's your massage therapist,

1279
01:26:25.941 --> 01:26:28.430
but then that's the finale to it.
He comes,

1280
01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:34.760
so the finale is,
he's like,
you're like,
what's going on?

1281
01:26:34.761 --> 01:26:38.150
He's like,
I'm done,
but it's like the best massage of the world.

1282
01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:40.440
You just have to watch him come.

1283
01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:47.450
Thank you,
sir.
Yeah,
seriously.
What if no,
really?
Let's consider it.

1284
01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:51.530
What if he gives a really good massage,
but then at the end he comes like,

1285
01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:55.370
I think I'm fine with it.
It doesn't come on me.
Right?
No,
it's not a,

1286
01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:57.620
it's not an invisible companies like he was just doing.

1287
01:27:00.230 --> 01:27:04.160
Yeah.
I'd be like,
all right,
if it was the best one ever,

1288
01:27:04.350 --> 01:27:07.820
you would be in such a relaxed state that he's,
you know what?

1289
01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:11.990
You know what happens in that relaxed state?
You,
you're cool with more.

1290
01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:14.180
Like in other words,
you're like,
you're,
you're,

1291
01:27:14.181 --> 01:27:17.960
you're down with whatever somebody wants to do.
So if he's like,

1292
01:27:18.410 --> 01:27:21.500
now I'm going to come,
you'd be like,
all right,

1293
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:30.720
are you ready?
If it's anonymous,
but wait,
don't wait.
Close your eyes.

1294
01:27:32.150 --> 01:27:35.800
Close Your eyes,

Close your eyes.

1295
01:27:36.290 --> 01:27:39.780
<v 10>All right.
Right now you're in such a relaxed though.
Listen,</v>

1296
01:27:40.050 --> 01:27:42.660

You're,

1297
01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:47.190
you're barely on the brink of consciousness.
You're,

1298
01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:51.420
you're like Jello.
And he goes,

1299
01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:55.890
he sees end of those session and you go,

1300
01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:02.490
Oh wait,

And you go,

1301
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:03.930
okay.
And then he goes,

1302
01:28:10.350 --> 01:28:14.790
<v 7>that's all you hear.
And then he just,
he just came.
Why don't you like that?</v>

1303
01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:18.570
It's nice.
He's so creepy.
Okay,
what if it listen to this?
Okay,

1304
01:28:18.571 --> 01:28:22.230
what if he's a chef and he makes the most awesome food?

1305
01:28:22.231 --> 01:28:25.590
It's a personal chef and he's over at her house and he's making you like an

1306
01:28:25.591 --> 01:28:29.370
exotic seven course meal.
Okay,
but the payment is,

1307
01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:31.260
you have to watch him come like that

1308
01:28:35.010 --> 01:28:39.300
and he stands there.
You're done eating.
You see furniture designer now your bill.

1309
01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:44.610
Oh,
okay.
And he stands there and he gets totally naked.

1310
01:28:44.611 --> 01:28:48.970
And you watch him do the 50 50 50 lingam thing?
Yeah.

1311
01:28:49.140 --> 01:28:53.730
And then he and the grand finale as he comes on your lap.

1312
01:28:54.930 --> 01:28:58.710
Wait,
why does he have to come on your lats?
Just part of his thing.

1313
01:28:58.711 --> 01:29:01.740
That's payment.
What do you mean he comes on your thighs?
Yes.

1314
01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.220
You got the dinner Napkin.
You've got the dinner Napkin there,

1315
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:10.720
you finished your meal at the grand finale.
He's like,
did you like that meal?

1316
01:29:10.721 --> 01:29:15.060
You Go,
yeah.
He goes,
now I have not.
The payment is now.
And he goes,

1317
01:29:15.061 --> 01:29:19.790
open your eyes watching me come.
And then he goes 50 so it's one,
two oh.

1318
01:29:19.950 --> 01:29:20.910
Oh my God.

1319
01:29:22.130 --> 01:29:25.920
And he does it 50 times and then he does his anal glands and then he comes

1320
01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:31.950
and enjoy meal.
That's it.
Well,
you have to watch it.

1321
01:29:31.951 --> 01:29:33.660
You have to watch every stroke over.

1322
01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:41.100
How good is the dinner?
It's so good.
It's a,
it's like a Michelin Star.

1323
01:29:41.101 --> 01:29:45.000
100% watch it.
I would 100%.
Why wouldn't you?
Yeah.

1324
01:29:45.001 --> 01:29:46.680
That's not a lot to pay for a good meal.

1325
01:29:46.710 --> 01:29:51.600
But you're watching that guy come and stroke his dick for,

1326
01:29:51.810 --> 01:29:54.780
I mean that's 300 strokes.
It's going to be a while.

1327
01:29:55.930 --> 01:29:58.470
But here's what I would ask.
Can I eat dessert through that?

1328
01:29:58.830 --> 01:30:01.050
I'll kill time until you feel

1329
01:30:03.610 --> 01:30:06.740
exactly like right.

1330
01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:11.450
So you feel so you see when you do keep looking good.

1331
01:30:12.970 --> 01:30:14.370
I ain't got to pay for dinner.

1332
01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:21.690
When you squeeze this all gets them coming up.
I gotta pay for this meal.

1333
01:30:21.691 --> 01:30:25.140
So would you do that?
That's not that much to pay for a really good dinner.

1334
01:30:26.710 --> 01:30:29.630
Well then I don't understand why you wouldn't let him make love to you.

1335
01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:32.033
<v 8>What?</v>

1336
01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:35.210
<v 7>It's,
you're going to have a great time.
No,
I don't like it.</v>

1337
01:30:35.570 --> 01:30:40.220
I'm very selective of who I let do that to me.
Call me crazy.
Uh,

1338
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.340
50 times that site.

1339
01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:47.300
We have Tom Foster your payment to Tom that fit the time thou so a lot.

1340
01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:49.760
It's a lot of off it.
Am I doing this?

1341
01:30:49.870 --> 01:30:52.340
You have to do every day until you can control.

1342
01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:58.340
Who can really fuck though?
Stop it.
I'm serious.
He can really fuck.

1343
01:30:58.780 --> 01:31:02.720
He nasty as hell.
He's not fucking nobody.
He's jerking his Dick 300 times a day.

1344
01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:06.680
If you were fucking on the regular,
he wouldn't be doing this hog stroking.

1345
01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:07.873
Oh my gosh.

1346
01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:09.753
<v 8>Okay.</v>

1347
01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:15.770
<v 7>That's my new favorite song.
It's so horrible.</v>

1348
01:31:15.950 --> 01:31:19.970
Vegan Vagina.
I don't know what's worse.
The vegan vagina guy or this guy.

1349
01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:25.010
I hate them both now.
Vegan vagina guys will way worser.
He Nasty.

1350
01:31:25.820 --> 01:31:29.900
All right,

Go.
God,
that was so gross.
I'm so disappointed.
I'm so angry.

1351
01:31:29.901 --> 01:31:32.870
We closed on him hot.
It's not hot.

1352
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:36.950
It's hot outside in here.
It's freezing.
My feet are cold selling outside.

1353
01:31:36.951 --> 01:31:40.910
We're going to go swimming now.
Okay.
I love you.

1355
