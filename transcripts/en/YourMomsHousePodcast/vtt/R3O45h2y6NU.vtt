00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.290
Well.
Well,

2
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.960

<v 0>And so here it is gene.
It's show time.</v>

4
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.160
The business has done.
Let's get into it with the realness.
You Ready?
Yeah,

5
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.170

Okay.
Yeah.

6
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.880
<v 2>Today I'm going to be a doctor.
So I am doctor Mel.</v>

7
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.070
You can call me Doctor Mel.

8
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.700
And today we are going to talk about ways to tell her pussy stinks.

9
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.563
Hmm.

10
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.250
<v 1>Oh is Randy.
Don't bring anyone in loving.
Well</v>

11
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.690
go to your mom's house
and

12
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.420
Christina,
it's interesting.

13
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.513
Okay.

14
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.680
I
have

15
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.270
<v 0>aids minor right now.</v>

16
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.600
Why did you turn away to blow your nose from the microphone?

17
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.390
You when you know the audience likes to hear it.
I don't know.

18
00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:53.600
It's just habit and we're polite guy.
You're not polite.
I am polite.

19
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.830
You don't look,
they loved it.

20
00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:59.720
When I sneezed it became a wide sensation.
I would sneeze,

21
00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:03.770
but I didn't have a sneeze.
You brought home aides from Nebraska.
Oh Man.

22
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.820
And I shoot a special this week.
Hi.
It's the worst possible time.
I,
um,
yeah,

23
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.160
I went to the doctor that I just said like,
look man,

24
00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:12.890
normally I would just ride this out and he says a cold or something,

25
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.670
but I can't risk anything.
So he just like,

26
00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:21.410
we'll just give you fucking high dosage.
Everything.
Don't get three.

27
00:02:21.411 --> 00:02:23.960
Told me they'll risk it.
Don't text while driving.
You can't do that.

28
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.790
So we'll see you,
man.
I hope I make it through it.
You,
I know you will.

29
00:02:28.791 --> 00:02:30.890
And here's why,
right?
You're strong.

30
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.660
You've also got many days to go in the week,
so you'll,
you'll hopefully,

31
00:02:35.661 --> 00:02:38.270
you'll be strong by the time you have to tape and you know something else.

32
00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:41.870
You're a pro.
You've been doing this for a million years,
you know you've done it,

33
00:02:41.871 --> 00:02:45.230
you've done standup sick now that you want to,
it's terrible.
But you know what?

34
00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:47.810
You'll get an adrenaline push.
You know what happens?

35
00:02:47.811 --> 00:02:51.530
Like you can perform with a fever of like 102 and diarrhea because your body

36
00:02:51.531 --> 00:02:55.730
shuts it down.
I booked a car to drive me for that show tomorrow just because,

37
00:02:55.731 --> 00:02:58.460
yeah,
I was like,
I'm trying to get,
you know what I mean?

38
00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:02.320
Like just want to relax in the car.
Yeah.
Not Be stressed about.

39
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:07.000
It just poses a stink and people want to know what's going on.

40
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.780
<v 2>I can tell you,
I can tell you how bad was his mouth.</v>

41
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.960
I don't because I want to talk about pain but I don't,

42
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.740
and I'm talking to him about what guys I've been telling me,
they'd been like,

43
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.250
oh my God,
fuck this bitch pussy smell so bad

44
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.230
<v 0>Melanie.
Wow.
Dr Mill after.
So I fuck this bitch.
Yeah.</v>

45
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.950
<v 2>Jeez.
Take her to a cab</v>

46
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.950
by herself and make her tell her how about your truck?

47
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.390
If she says no,

48
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.430
she say I can't talk because everybody came and then when she 12th that's a way

49
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:46.270
cause you know she'd be moving the booty and then video opens up,
opens up,

50
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:50.980
opens up and then the smells.
This like comes out.
So

51
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.600
<v 0>I think she has a lot of experience actually validate Dr Melanie.
Well,</v>

52
00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:59.190
how would you know how to identify a stinky beef?
Unless you have one.

53
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.310
Well,
I don't know.
I wouldn't accuse Melanie of doctor,
excuse me,

54
00:04:02.311 --> 00:04:06.840
Dr Melanie of having one and where are you credentialed Dr. Bell that she is

55
00:04:06.841 --> 00:04:11.220
giving you ways to figure it out,
which I appreciate.

56
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.300
I can tell you some other ways.
Oh,
stick your finger in there.
No.

57
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.260
Does she wear patrolling and that's,

58
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.570
I'd rather you pussies smell like a fucking sewer in New Orleans the day after

59
00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:25.860
Mardi gras.
Then smell Pachulia oil.

60
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.990
Well that's why they put it on their masks.

61
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.250
Other smells Pachulia I'm convinced that that's the smell of dirty box that's

62
00:04:34.981 --> 00:04:37.320
made from dirty vagina.
It's disgusting.

63
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.300
<v 2>If she says no,
you already know.
Okay,
stinky because he is,</v>

64
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.400
she said and she does it.

65
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.000
Then you can try smelling already cause you know the,

66
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.540
the booty cheeks opening.

67
00:04:50.541 --> 00:04:54.980
It's like I can't twerk to say my eyes for the bad smell of the visit.

68
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.890
<v 0>Right.</v>

69
00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.250
I'd say another way you can tell is everybody at burning man as a stinky pussy.

70
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:01.560
Yeah.

71
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.760
They're not showering for a week and they're on that Playa and it's hot and all

72
00:05:05.761 --> 00:05:09.070
they do is hose people down.
There's no showers.
White girls with dreads.
Yeah.

73
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.700
I'll try.
If you have dreadlocks,
it stinks down there too.
Yeah,
definitely.

74
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.170
I mean if you're white,
if you're white and you had dreadlocks,

75
00:05:16.171 --> 00:05:20.380
definitely I'm going to go and say a lot of leather,

76
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.350
the leather wristbands and yeah,

77
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.370
let me get your box stinks and,
well,

78
00:05:26.371 --> 00:05:29.970
leather pants aren't very poorest either.
Oh,
I'm going to go with leather pants.

79
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.110
I am going to go and,
and this is,
this is going to be a hot debate.
Um,

80
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.450
women in Birkenstocks.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You can tell by shoe wear footwear.
Yeah.

81
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.940
Yeah.
He looked down if they have like dirty feet.
No,

82
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.400
I don't know if the Birkenstocks really equal that,

83
00:05:47.401 --> 00:05:52.401
but I do think how you take care of the rest of your body is indicative of how

84
00:05:52.621 --> 00:05:54.600
you take care of that.
Yeah.
I don't think it's true.

85
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.130
<v 2>Sit down.
I think,
um,</v>

86
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.520
if you guys are comfortable enough and you already go to a house,

87
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.720
go smell her auntie dirty dirty underwear.

88
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.610
I know it sounds kind of gross,

89
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.330
but I am telling you that.

90
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.180
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

91
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.980
<v 2>you should take a chance and go smell it.</v>

92
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.320
<v 0>What do you think?
And she's the the vagina detective?
Yeah.
Do you think,</v>

93
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.320
I mean,
I guess you could tell right by smelling her underwear.
I mean,

94
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.480
if we're going to go through the trouble of having her twerk and then finding

95
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:29.660
her dirty undies and sniffing him,
why not just hook up with her and find out?

96
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.870
Just eat that sneaker.

97
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.380
You could put a digit down there and sniff your digit.
I mean,

98
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:37.214
isn't that,

99
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.870
<v 3>I got a train.
Yeah.</v>

100
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.860
<v 0>I don't know what's,
what are you?
What have you been doing historically?
Yeah.</v>

101
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.290
I mean,
I don't care.
Yeah.

102
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.160
I don't care if it's my work together Trashcan,
I don't care.

103
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.533
<v 3>Okay.</v>

104
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.290
<v 0>I have a,
she's,</v>

105
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.660
I remember encountering one that was not in ware county.
No,

106
00:06:59.661 --> 00:07:03.320
I encountered one.
Oh,
not like the most pristine

107
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.320
<v 3>whatever.
Didn't bother me.</v>

108
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.200
<v 0>Okay.
Let me know.
I wasn't eating fucking meals down there,
you know?</v>

109
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.540
All right.
Yeah.
You're just,

110
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.500
<v 3>you shove it in and then you're done.</v>

111
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.190
<v 0>I don't know.
I think all this stuff about stinky,
this and that,
it's like,</v>

112
00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:25.020
you know what,
we're all people.
It's just some days you nasty sown days,

113
00:07:25.021 --> 00:07:28.960
you ain't,
I've smelled my own balls wherever.
Like Jesus,
man,

114
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.570
that smells horrific.
Right?
I mean,
don't you feel like there,

115
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.990
it's just hot and some good days and bad days.
Bad days for sure.

116
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.150
That the area between your thigh and the bottom of the bag,

117
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.540
you can put your thumb down there like this.
Yeah.
Was Nasty.
Not on everyday,

118
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.560
but there's some days where you're like,
that is foul.
Yeah.

119
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.570
I think it's interesting that there's so much focus on stinky vaginas,

120
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:59.850
but stinky balls or another problem to real issue or acting like a,

121
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.550
it's another thing that's dividing our nation.

122
00:08:03.551 --> 00:08:07.210
There's cat people are dog people still give vagina is a stinky malls.
Yeah.

123
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.360
No one is talking about those stinky balls.
No,
sorry.
But it's a woman's problem.

124
00:08:10.361 --> 00:08:14.860
It's silly.
It's silly.
It's a real issue.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.

125
00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:18.810
I mean like it's just all,
it's all body parts.
Who Cares?
Right.
Let's see,
uh,

126
00:08:18.811 --> 00:08:21.730
her other,
her other insight.
Let's check that doctor mouth.
Sure.

127
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.060
<v 2>If a gun is always crossing our legs,</v>

128
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:30.110
you know she has this thing keep busy because why not?
His hands crossed.

129
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.400
It's not comfortable.
I know they're talking about,
oh,
it's lady luck.

130
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.590
It's not comfortable to have your legs crossed at all time.

131
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.410
So even though I'm not a lady,
I'm telling the truth.

132
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:45.880
Nobody wants to cross them all the time on neither one with smelly Boosie.

133
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:51.420
<v 0>Yeah,
I do love her accent and I could watch her all day.
Yeah,</v>

134
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.980
I like watching her.
Yeah,
she's really pretty.
She was as second language though.

135
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:01.320
Bahamian?
No,
I mean your Mama's.
Yeah.
Why?
By hate my Bahamas.

136
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:05.660
It's not that accent or like she's an island island or hummus.

137
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.460
Okay,
but you said it like I know the island.

138
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.200
Aren't you the master of accents?
You tell me master.

139
00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:17.220
I thought she struggled just enough where it would imply that maybe English as a

140
00:09:17.221 --> 00:09:21.110
second line.
That's what I thought.
Who knows,
you know?
All right.

141
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.670
Sounds like a certain patois.

142
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:27.680
<v 2>All the girls you see with those crazy,</v>

143
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.390
but then they have like the sweating from the pussy.

144
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.370
What do you expect smells like?

145
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.850
Why are you sweating?
I mean,
I understand it skiing and stuff,

146
00:09:38.851 --> 00:09:43.350
but you know you swept,
most people stink.
So if you switched from the policy.

147
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.060
<v 0>Yeah,
good theories.
This is an interesting theory.</v>

148
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:55.340
She also says you can do this.
I didn't know.
She was like pretty aggressive.

149
00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.520
<v 2>It's are you in the car and you're driving</v>

150
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:04.310
30 minutes,
you guys get to your destination.
She gets out,

151
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:09.230
I cake closer to off for like five minutes.
They come back out and be like,
oh,

152
00:10:09.231 --> 00:10:13.880
I forgot something in the car,
go to the car and smell the seat of smell the car.

153
00:10:13.881 --> 00:10:17.030
If the call smell is different.
That what you used to,

154
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:22.310
you know that's her and you know that most likely a vagina.

155
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.990
<v 0>Hmm.
So interesting.
She has more suggestions.</v>

156
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:32.580
More.
There's more than this.
When she's really obsessed with these stinky vagina.

157
00:10:32.581 --> 00:10:35.520
Somebody,
some,
someone gone her head,
somebody said it to her once,

158
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:42.040
<v 2>but then again days the regular mode if you want to take your chance or</v>

159
00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.170
whatever,
well why you mess around?

160
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.020
I know you all do that already so I don't really need to tell you,

161
00:10:47.021 --> 00:10:50.880
but your finger her and then there's now anyway,

162
00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:54.370
some people don't mind or where they still take the El and be like,
okay.

163
00:10:54.371 --> 00:10:59.371
He was thinking but I was too deep in it to do it because I know a lot who do

164
00:11:00.851 --> 00:11:01.640
that.

165
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:06.060
<v 0>Yeah.
Maybe or Ivory Coast or something.
Could be,</v>

166
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.340
I don't know.
Yeah,
I don't know.
I'm throwing it out there.

167
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.490
The Turks and Caicos.
Yeah.

168
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.930
I'm saying maybe like Haitian could be you.
That'd be a good guy.
I hear,

169
00:11:17.931 --> 00:11:22.090
I hear more of a Patois than uh,
an actual like ESL thing happening.
Okay.

170
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.550
Maybe I'm Jamaican.
No.
Okay.

171
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.310
I'm going to go with Haitian because she's like light skin and she's got the

172
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:34.900
blue eyes are Bahamian.
Where's it?
Okay.
I know.
Where's,

173
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.160
where's Rehana from?
Barbados.
She's from Barbados.
She looks like she's got,

174
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:42.980
Rihanna is a coloring and stuff.
Not just stop guessing.

175
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:48.050
Never guess again.
That should be the name of your new album.
Can never guess.

176
00:11:48.051 --> 00:11:52.220
Never talk.
Stop talking.
This is kind of exciting.

177
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:57.250
One of the things we play on here quite often is,
you know,

178
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.260
when,
when great audio comes into our life.
So,
um,

179
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.320
let me see if I can,
this is,

180
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:10.120
this was such a big hit on our show and we assumed it was gone,

181
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.800
uh,
that it would never enter our life again.
Are we doing it?
We're doing it.

182
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:20.110
I'm so excited.
And so just tell us how it happened.
Your phone was off.

183
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.980
<v 4>My God,
no,
no.
My phone went home was silence and I don't,</v>

184
00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.230
I don't usually accept phone calls after a certain time.

185
00:12:27.231 --> 00:12:30.140
We put our son down and it's time for me to relax.
Yeah.
I never,

186
00:12:30.141 --> 00:12:35.141
I normally don't even look at the phone and I got a voicemail from a strange

187
00:12:35.871 --> 00:12:39.110
number I didn't recognize.
I transcribe it,

188
00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.120
I like to look and it couldn't transcribe it.

189
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.280
<v 0>I hit play.
Should I just play it?
And this is what I heard.</v>

190
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:52.290
<v 5>Hello May in companies here,
Marge,
in your mind,
I'm writing my name,
Jaxon White,</v>

191
00:12:52.291 --> 00:12:55.390
improper.
You don't have on my gym located,
we'll call.

192
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.550
They get trained my day and I'm yelling Jello,

193
00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.770
which was how the time they will do

194
00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.330
any good days at Ted.
Why do you just have to locate it?
You know,

195
00:13:04.331 --> 00:13:06.340
you have to go through and then Zammino me.

196
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.470
I think what you see if he'd been the z equals Rad.
The good.
Right.

197
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.290
The last mission when please call me to get someone's information.
Ma'Am.

198
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.680
That's my Kansas.
So the call me,
no know I get into his house.

199
00:13:19.681 --> 00:13:21.410
He lived me or is it,

200
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:26.740
<v 0>so for those that don't know,
we're over a year,</v>

201
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:31.700
this woman has been leaving messages for silo may uh,

202
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.580
this Persian woman has been leaving messages for Sala May on Christina's phone

203
00:13:36.581 --> 00:13:39.250
that cause she got a new number about a year and change ago.
Yeah.

204
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:44.730
And there's always aggressive cursing Farsi and some broken English.

205
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.010
Yeah.
Every time people write in our,
our,

206
00:13:48.011 --> 00:13:51.650
our Farsi speaking listeners translate for us.
Yeah.

207
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.220
But she had been gone for so long.
We assumed

208
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.370
<v 4>my months.
I mean,
I know the last sal,</v>

209
00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:01.270
I know the last we heard that there were squirrels in the trees and she's

210
00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:04.720
putting plastic bags in the trees to get rid of the squirrels and it worked.

211
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.810
And that was I think when we moved here.
So that was awesome.

212
00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:08.953
<v 6>Hello.
May</v>

213
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:15.900
I want to know what that Farsi ladies did?
He get on pictures and all of that.

214
00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:22.170
The most amazing these messages that Christina keeps getting nonstop on her

215
00:14:23.001 --> 00:14:28.001
phone to me or the person who's leaving never hears back from whoever.

216
00:14:28.911 --> 00:14:31.280
She's kind of whoever you're contacting.

217
00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:38.600
How about you?
Just so you guys aren't friends,
there's no love there.

218
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:42.203
Crazy.

219
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:56.650
Then you'd sexted for thank God you said sounds good

220
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.280
man.
Sounds

221
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:09.430
<v 4>that's Brian days.
Such a good sign.</v>

222
00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:14.700
And I thought we'd never hear from the silo may thing again.
Now if you hear,

223
00:15:14.701 --> 00:15:19.290
I don't,
I don't speak Farsi,
but she does say an English.
I lost my phone.
Yeah.

224
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:23.880
Now that could be a key component here and why we haven't heard from her in so

225
00:15:23.881 --> 00:15:24.714
long.

226
00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:28.760
<v 0>Could be,
but I'm glad she's back.
She has your number.
Same season.</v>

227
00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:30.440
She wrote that one down.

228
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.070
<v 4>She has it in her old,
uh,
contact book that they read,</v>

229
00:15:34.071 --> 00:15:37.460
put into her new iPhone or whatever.
Yeah.
So anyone speaking Farsi,

230
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:38.870
if you could translate that one,

231
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:43.520
let us know what's up with her and if she says her name,
who are you?

232
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.200
She never says her name.
I don't know what to call her.
Yeah,
it's really crazy.

233
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:52.370
But it brought so much joy back into my heart knowing that the sour me ladies

234
00:15:52.371 --> 00:15:53.204
back in town,

235
00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:58.700
<v 0>it's a lot.
I was actually just thinking about her a week prior,
like,
Oh,</v>

236
00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:02.940
I wish I could get other voicemail from Salamay lady.
It's been so long.
I know.

237
00:16:02.941 --> 00:16:06.510
We just thought we figured it was gone.
Yeah.
I mean,
you had every,

238
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.050
we all had good reason to believe it was going.
Yeah,
it's been,

239
00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:11.730
it's been since we moved here in November,
she was,
uh,

240
00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.470
leaving messages to cover your lemon.
You're your citrus.
And in plastic bags.

241
00:16:16.471 --> 00:16:18.420
We got it that one time that just fell out.
Yeah,
I know.

242
00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.070
Because the squirrels were eating the citrus and if you cover it in the bags,

243
00:16:23.071 --> 00:16:27.750
they don't,
they don't need it.
Yeah.
So silly.
Yeah.
Um,

244
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:32.840
yeah.
So do you want to maybe as a time,
I mean the camp.

245
00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:37.870
<v 4>Yeah,
do it.
Let's hit it.
I want all the sound effects.
I want chips and ball.</v>

246
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:42.010
I want a cat eating kibble and I want a brand new sound effect for this

247
00:16:42.011 --> 00:16:42.610
announcement.

248
00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:46.090
<v 0>Okay.
This is a huge announcement.
Here we go.
We'll get that explosions</v>

249
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.710

250
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:02.040
<v 0>big announcement chips in a bowl.
It's a big investment.</v>

251
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.850
That's a cat eating kibble.
That's right.
That's my ads off.

252
00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:18.730
It's the cutest sound.
It's such a cute sound.
That means even bigger.
Even bigger.

253
00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:28.010

278
00:19:27.871 --> 00:19:30.810
house listening.
So it's a tribute to the Mommy's,

279
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.530
It's really exciting.
I'm so excited.
I can't wait.
I couldn't be happier.

280
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:39.690
And I called it mother inferior also as a shout out to the mommies mom's house.

281
00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.790
Super.
Your mom's house centric.
Yes.
It's a really great hour.
I watched it live.

282
00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:48.180
You bring me up and that's your voice.

283
00:19:48.181 --> 00:19:51.160
You'll hear it in the opening of the special time I left.

284
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.060
I left it in that.
You're my gene is bringing me up.
That's how special that was.

285
00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:02.010
October 10th.

286
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.580
I can't wait either.
So excited.
So amazed.

287
00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:09.150
Are we going to watch it every night before we go to bed together in our

288
00:20:09.151 --> 00:20:12.750
rotation of my standup specials?
Well,
that's what I do every night.

289
00:20:12.751 --> 00:20:15.690
I watch mostly stories.
Completely normal.
Goodnight.

290
00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.530
And then I kiss you goodnight.
And they

291
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:18.940
<v 9>the dogs.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

292
00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:22.930
I even have a little video of things I put on Youtube and I watch all of those

293
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:28.850
of yourself myself.
Oh,
could you man,
I'm sure there are people that do that.

294
00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:33.230
There's definitely people that do that.
That's crazy.
100% people that do that.
Um,

295
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:35.710
speaking of Patois there,

296
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:40.810
this is a real Jamaican guy and he's blown away that an Asian man is in his

297
00:20:41.211 --> 00:20:43.820
store and speaks Patois.
It was pretty funny.

298
00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.100
<v 10>No,
what?
Yeah,
and</v>

299
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:53.040
<v 12>10 among come pick up your money.
What kind of [inaudible] what?</v>

300
00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.410
We did have enough customer for beer.
It's a China mine call Matt.

301
00:20:56.411 --> 00:20:57.520
Tell him what my rotted,

302
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:06.200
hold on one more time.
Montana one
didn't want to

303
00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:13.010
come in.
You do you want I want the money.
The money.
No,

304
00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:18.603
you get me.

305
00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:20.020
<v 0>That is weird,
right?</v>

306
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.400
It's like faces to put an accent on it.

307
00:21:25.481 --> 00:21:27.920
You just go like,
that doesn't add up.
Why don't,
I mean,
I don't know about you,

308
00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:31.120
but I'm pretty open minded and I don't feel weird.
Do you feel weird?

309
00:21:31.121 --> 00:21:33.680
Like what do you,
what do you think you normally you should here?
Uh,

310
00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:37.000
just different stuff.
I mean,
I know,
but it's true.

311
00:21:37.001 --> 00:21:41.740
Like when you see whatever you see,
like gingers in speaking Spanish,

312
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.660
I always am like,
oh,
that's an interesting,

313
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:48.040
like you just don't assume that a ginger speak just because they're red hair

314
00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:51.280
makes them not intelligent or,
no,
no.
Just that,

315
00:21:51.281 --> 00:21:54.610
like the language isn't usually associated with the way they look.
No,
I know.

316
00:21:54.611 --> 00:21:57.640
I'm just kidding.
It's like an Irish person speaking Chinese.
You're like,
wait,

317
00:21:57.641 --> 00:22:01.030
what?
Yeah.
Like Canelo Alvarez,
the boxer,

318
00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:05.080
he's this redhead white guy and you know,

319
00:22:05.081 --> 00:22:08.860
he's Mexican so he speaks just Spanish.
His English is terrible.

320
00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:13.450
And when I would study abroad,
like I remember there was,
you know,

321
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.940
there's redheads and you're like,
you speak Spanish.
And they're like,
yeah,

322
00:22:15.941 --> 00:22:20.290
I was born here.
And you're like,
oh yeah,
you guys are everywhere.

323
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.220
Remember that time we saw that white guy totally spit in Chinese.
That's the,

324
00:22:24.221 --> 00:22:25.600
that's the most crazy.

325
00:22:25.601 --> 00:22:30.601
That's the wildest of all white people are fluid in any Asian language.

326
00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:34.030
And it usually by the way,
blows Asian peoples mind.

327
00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.990
Like that's like when my sister spoke mandarin at that dinner.

328
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:42.700
Do you remember that?
I was like,
yeah.
He was like,
it's so hard.

329
00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:46.120
It's so hard.
It is.
Yeah.
Well it's such a foreign tongue.

330
00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:50.050
Like I think that's what so bizarre.
Like I've never seen a white person speak.

331
00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:53.510
Um,
you know,
Hindi have,
you know,
I mean,
of course,

332
00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:56.560
of course it exists,
but you just don't,

333
00:22:56.710 --> 00:23:01.710
you don't see what I've ever been in a museum probably in Paris.

334
00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:02.681
And they're,
you know,

335
00:23:02.681 --> 00:23:06.400
they had the tour groups and there was a Japanese tour group led by a white

336
00:23:06.401 --> 00:23:10.570
woman and she was stopping at every painting with this Japanese group just

337
00:23:10.571 --> 00:23:15.280
ripping through Japanese,
you know,
with all the little mannerism.

338
00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.560
<v 9>Sorry,
Todd Monet.
I'm an IB and they were all like,</v>

339
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:27.730

341
00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:34.200

Giving instructions.

My theory?
Was He just a pervert?

371
00:25:30.491 --> 00:25:34.420
He's been talking about his balls since the 70s it's evidenced here and he wants

372
00:25:34.421 --> 00:25:37.630
to talk about his cock and balls all day and make a living at it and now he does

373
00:25:37.631 --> 00:25:37.800

Through the kidney.

378
00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:54.840

380
00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:04.223
Okay.

381
00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:08.900
And the biggest west in the human is the declaration demo.

50 Times a day and then you'll be better.
Yeah.

385
00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:21.970
It especially if you're not circumstances,
you got to do this even more.

386
00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:26.100
That's true.
Now that I hear him speaking back then he should know.

387
00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:30.320
He should know circumcision by now.
It's an old school.

388
00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:31.770
I don't say it's been 30 years.

389
00:26:31.771 --> 00:26:35.160
He should know circumstance like I thought he just dances.
Yeah.
He's like you.

390
00:26:35.161 --> 00:26:36.430
You're not circumstances.

391

<v 13>You don't mind.
You cannot.
You don't know how to Tom Farm.

393
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.670
<v 13>a monkey.
Yes.
Few sounded like chanting inside you.</v>

394
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.240
It's really something on term at home.
You know you do.

395
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.700
And sometimes we can watch TV and do that.

396
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:59.000
<v 0>Yeah.
He's been a pervert his whole life.
What did I tell you?</v>

397
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:03.200
What supports my theory that he's been a jerk his whole life doing this stuff.

398
00:27:03.201 --> 00:27:07.370
Embarrassing himself and making audiences uncomfortable.
And now look

399
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:12.560

Of course it took that long.

413
00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:10.910
You think he's married?
Whose Mrs?
Rub Rub.

414
00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:15.170
I think he's been married.
Yeah,
I think he's done.

415
00:28:15.171 --> 00:28:18.230
Been married and then I think he's been through a few.

416
00:28:18.231 --> 00:28:22.190
She caught him sharpening his knife a few,
many too many times.
He's like,
are you,

417
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.530
are we ever going to do it?
He's like,
wow.
Sharpening my name.
Right.
His shop.
Yeah.

418
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.470
I think he's been dropping that,
that load everywhere.

419
00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.700
Do you think he's just really,
he really is just into sharpening his own.
Oh,

420
00:28:34.701 --> 00:28:37.940
for sure.
Yeah.
Then sexual energy and yeah,

421
00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:43.340
it's the morning guy.
I think he just wants it all the time.
It's so gross.

422
00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:48.100
Would you kiss him?
No.
Wa like a nice soft skills.

423
00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:53.870
Why?
Bam.
Stop Kissing him.
What'd you,
what'd you make out with him?

424
00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.290
What'd you kiss?
Kisses.
Rob rubs.
I don't think it'd be very nice.

425
00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:01.580
What'd you rather makes?
We love to him.
Eighties.
Rob.

426
00:29:01.581 --> 00:29:05.720
Rob Or present day.
Rob broke.
Die.
Um,
think about it.

427
00:29:05.721 --> 00:29:10.420
I want you to think about it because I think present day,
I think president,

428
00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:14.930
he's just so much more experienced,
but it's like musicians where you're like,

429
00:29:14.931 --> 00:29:19.040
I like their early stuff cause they're so,
no.
I like,
I like them.
No,

430
00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:24.080
I like them.
No,
you like the technique refined.
He would know so much.

431
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:27.260
He would just school me now back then he'd be like me your balls.

432
00:29:27.261 --> 00:29:30.790
But we already do it 36 times already do that.
There's nothing new.

433
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:35.240
But now he'd be like,
pull that circumstances back from,
let me do it.

434
00:29:35.241 --> 00:29:38.150
Really for him.
He guys are gross.

435
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:40.490
Can I say what happened yesterday?

436
00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:45.820
You were in bed sick and I went out to the front yard and I found a dead rat.

437
00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:50.830
You did.

438
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:54.610
Now we've been laying out rat traps to catch these assholes that had been

439
00:29:54.611 --> 00:29:58.030
shitting in my kitchen.
Tell you guys about it.
Yeah,
I mean look,

440
00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:03.010
they can live outside.
That's fine.
But then when you come into my house you shit.

441
00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:07.890
Yeah,
my floor.
It's a problem.
I said fuck you.
Right?
Yeah.

442
00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.680
You said you'd sit hub or wearing the same shit I got on.

443
00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:15.400
You know what the key was though.
We set out all these traps and everything.

444
00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:19.210
The guy that came over to her house showed me that under,

445
00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:23.290
under a sink in the kitchen,
uh,
where the pipe comes in.

446
00:30:23.291 --> 00:30:25.030
I might've already said this,
but if I didn't,

447
00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.350
there's like where the pipe comes in.

448
00:30:26.351 --> 00:30:31.351
There's also a space time hype meets the wall and it's bigger than the space

449
00:30:33.161 --> 00:30:37.930
needed for the pipe to fit through the wall.
So I got the insulation foam.

450
00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.230
Yup.
And sprayed it in there.
There's no weight.

451
00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:45.670
And we never saw them again after that rat lock.
And,
uh,

452
00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.750
and just so you know,
rats,
the guy showed us,
he goes,

453
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.340
they need an opening this big,
and I'm holding on my finger.

454
00:30:51.341 --> 00:30:54.640
It's maybe the size of a dime.
No,
no,
sorry.
Nickel and nickel.

455
00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.160
And as long as their head can get through the whole,

456
00:30:57.161 --> 00:31:00.040
he said they can squish their shitty little bodies into your house.

457
00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:04.060
So when you think about it,
they find an opening,
not very big,
not hard to do.

458
00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:06.970
So these assholes come in your house and they poop all over.

459
00:31:06.971 --> 00:31:10.330
Your stuff is so nasty.
So when I found that out yesterday,

460
00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:15.520
so I was thrilled and I put on some latex gloves and I double bagged it and you

461
00:31:16.331 --> 00:31:17.410
know,
but I was,

462
00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:22.450
I was surprised actually it how happy I was to catch a dead rat.
I was,

463
00:31:22.451 --> 00:31:25.540
you were talking about it a lot.
A lot.
I took a photo,
I sent it to you.

464
00:31:25.541 --> 00:31:30.030
I texted it to the guy that helped us set the rat traps outside and I kind of

465
00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.150
got worried because I was like,

466
00:31:31.151 --> 00:31:34.570
the only thing that could have made me happier is if we set up hidden cameras

467
00:31:34.571 --> 00:31:37.270
and I can watch it die.
Listen to yourself.
I know.

468
00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:40.630
I worry because I was really thrilled because I feel like he did us wrong.

469
00:31:40.631 --> 00:31:43.680
Who's the psycho killer and this now I thought it was me.

470
00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:45.780
I know a little bit of it is,

471
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.730
I'm a little worried at how thrilled I was to find it dead.

472
00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:54.760
Well just cause it's a threat to my,
my young,
a threat to my home,

473
00:31:54.761 --> 00:31:56.490
to the cleanliness of her house.
I just,

474
00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.470
it's so the only people pooping our house should be cigarettes.
Period.

475
00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.880
You little jeans and me.
Three people who poop under this roof.
That's it.

476
00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:07.630
I think guests,
guests there a lot of posts and the nanny to come over.

477
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:12.490
The plumber.
Plumber took a lot of leeway on that.
Yeah.

478
00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:16.840
Let me get electricians.
Gene,
we're going to take a dump in here.

479
00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:22.150
I can't believe you.
Briars nasty morning down to our house.
What a jerk jerk.

480
00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:26.530
I was like nine to come on now.
You shouldn't take that shit.
Think anyway,

481
00:32:26.531 --> 00:32:28.270
that happened.
And then um,

482
00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:34.380
the other last week we were having breakfast and as we do and we have our coffee

483
00:32:35.201 --> 00:32:40.201
and then we eat breakfast and you had to take a dump in the middle of breakfast.

484
00:32:40.551 --> 00:32:43.100
Like you felt the tug,
like you had to go.

485
00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:47.870
And what I think is interesting about you is that when you feel the need to
shit,

486
00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:53.300
you keep eating,
you eat through the pain of having to take a shit depends.

487
00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:57.980
Depends on how good the meal looks and how bad I have to shit.

488
00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:02.900
If it's a mediocre meal,
I'll be like,
I'll just shit later.

489
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:08.330
But if it's like,
wow,
if I go like this is going to be an awesome meal,
you know,

490
00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:13.160
then I'll go,
shit now.
No,
you mean if it's a weight,
if it's an awesome meal,

491
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:16.400
you'll go shit now and then come back and eat it cold.
No,

492
00:33:16.401 --> 00:33:20.720
I'm saying like if I walk into a place and I order food and then they're like,

493
00:33:20.721 --> 00:33:24.890
food's on the way.
Oh,
I have to take his shit and I'm like,

494
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:27.440
this is going to be an amazing meal.

495
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:30.620
I'll go clear the chamber to really enjoy the meal.
Oh No.

496
00:33:30.621 --> 00:33:33.050
I'm talking about the foods already in front of you.

497
00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:37.050
We're in the process of eating.
This happened last week.
I got to take a shit.

498
00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:40.070
Yeah,
we were eating already.
How urgently though?
There's so many levels.

499
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:44.150
But for me,
for instance,
I know like,
Hey,
I have to go,

500
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:49.400
the need to go is kind of not making this meal enjoyable,
so I'm gonna get up,

501
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:51.500
go take it down.
Come back,
eat my food cold,

502
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:54.410
but at least at least I don't have to shit.
No,
I don't think like that.

503
00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:59.600
I see you walk me through your logic because I,
I just don't think,
I don't,

504
00:33:59.601 --> 00:34:03.220
can't sit there and then eat and feel like I used to love those.

505
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:07.850
Like I could take a shit and I have to shit.
Those are different.

506
00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:13.160
Cut and have to take a shit right now.
I got to eat this right now,

507
00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:17.300
but if like if I go have to shit right now,
I'm still go.

508
00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:20.900
Just depends,
you know?
So you're telling me it's just,

509
00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.680
it's just the level of severity.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
How,

510
00:34:24.681 --> 00:34:27.470
how severe and again,
how good this meal's going to be.

511
00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:32.240
If it's like really enjoyable.

512
00:34:32.241 --> 00:34:36.110
I'd rather not have that feeling of having to share.
Yeah.

513
00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:39.400
Interesting.
Should we,
they,

514
00:34:39.401 --> 00:34:42.410
we should pause to think our guests going to be here any moment.
Tress pause.

515
00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:46.010
Let's press pause and then he does.
Yeah.
Yeah.

516
00:34:46.011 --> 00:34:47.480
That's a great thing to bring up when he gets here.

517
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:52.880
We back very soon and we're back with big,

518
00:34:52.881 --> 00:34:57.710
dumb,
goofy retard cheeks,
cheeks,

519
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:04.370
so intense.
I love him.
I love under the weather.

520
00:35:04.371 --> 00:35:09.110
So we're here under the weather.
We're here with,
uh,
you'll you don't even know.

521
00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:13.170
Oh my God.
Don't even tell her.
So you know,
fighters have nicknames,
right?

522
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:14.720
So it's like Iron Mike Tyson.

523
00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:19.220
Do you know what his nickname is as a fighter,
Brendan?

524
00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:23.580
The genes?
Nope.
This is so exciting.
I cannot tell you how exciting.

525
00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:28.250
So it just hit me.
Okay.
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Tell her your nickname as a fighter.

526
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:30.103
Big Brown.

527
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:36.050
I think I saw somebody write that.
Yeah,
I got it from Brian.

528
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:38.040
It's because he took like that biggest shits

529
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.160
<v 9>and all of the US ever.
That's mean Cain Velasquez.</v>

530
00:35:41.161 --> 00:35:44.250
We have to battle over that name.
So did you guys,
when you're,

531
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:46.740
cause there all these stories about like,
I don't know if you've ever,

532
00:35:46.741 --> 00:35:51.120
when when Phelps Michael Phelps was training that he was eating like 12,000

533
00:35:51.121 --> 00:35:52.080
calories a day.

534
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:56.250
Did you have like heavy intake when you're training or no.

535
00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:59.640
Like did you eat calorically a lot?
No,
not really.

536
00:35:59.641 --> 00:36:01.570
I've never been that like a huge eater.
I,

537
00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:05.250
I'd say I'm more in tuned with my diet now that I retired,

538
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.400
that I'm in show business then when I was fighting,
because again,

539
00:36:08.401 --> 00:36:11.490
when you're fighting you can kind of eat whatever you want because you're going

540
00:36:11.491 --> 00:36:13.530
to burn it off.
That's what they say.

541
00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:18.240
No but isn't that crazy like shredded.
But I was like,

542
00:36:18.241 --> 00:36:21.760
no I worked out nonstop but I wasn't like you know the biggest thing for that,

543
00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:26.770
if if you follow football you think about like those two days and then you're

544
00:36:27.211 --> 00:36:31.440
like,
wait,
how are guys still fat?
You know?
Because like I'm serious.

545
00:36:31.441 --> 00:36:36.390
Like you would go,
you think about like how much you're moving and burning in,

546
00:36:36.391 --> 00:36:40.540
in like in like a summer camp for five weeks.
It's only five weeks ago.

547
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:43.410
I can't do that.
It's like normal shit.

548
00:36:43.411 --> 00:36:46.950
And then also like I stay so fast it's genetics that's,

549
00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:50.670
that's big part of eating but don't eat so much.

550
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:55.530
Cause I used to do Kung Fu in the park when I was 28 years old and I would burn

551
00:36:55.531 --> 00:37:00.531
so many calories but then I'd go eat a bean and cheese burrito and two talks and

552
00:37:00.541 --> 00:37:01.620
then I was still fucking fat.

553
00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:06.360
My mentality has always been like I would do like an hour workout with a trainer

554
00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:09.990
and then be like,
I guess I could eat like 15,000 then I'm good.

555
00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:15.180
Good.
Sometimes you are sometimes you over this but I would,

556
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:19.800
I've not been so I've never been so self conscious of my diet tool.

557
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.500
I started doing comedy like,
like really,
you know,

558
00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:24.440
whenever I'm comes from when I'm backstage,
yeah.

559
00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.810
I usually like spread my legs so I'm not as tall.

560
00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:30.600
I'm usually super self conscious of what I wear because I don't want to look

561
00:37:30.601 --> 00:37:34.500
that big.
Oh I see.
That's interesting.
Do you feel you feel,

562
00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:39.230
you really think about what you're wearing all flat in the,
in terms of what the,

563
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:43.310
that you don't want to appear like the uh,
too much of like a stud.
You,

564
00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.800
well you don't want to appear too big.
Like,

565
00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:50.560
I'm not going to go on there with like a under Armour tight compress shirt.
Yeah.

566
00:37:50.561 --> 00:37:54.570
That's not cool.
Right?
Yeah.
That's super lame.
It's also like,

567
00:37:54.571 --> 00:37:55.740
it's funny with comedy,

568
00:37:56.580 --> 00:38:01.470
if you have a physical attribute that is like a blessing,

569
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:03.240
you almost want to disguise it.

570
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:08.430
Like super muscular guys shouldn't try to show the muscles and super attractive

571
00:38:08.971 --> 00:38:11.300
girls like I'm sure you dress it down,
right.

572
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:15.870
Not going to have your titties out or you're asking and I have huge tits,

573
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:20.810
like huge tits.
I would never guess that's right.
No,
there,
there,
there,

574
00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:21.720
there,
there.

575
00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:26.720
You know that I'm fucking like quadrupled above a quadruple,

576
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:31.420
like F.
I'm not exaggerating.
Damn good.

577
00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:34.950
Nobody would know it because I have and Phyllis Diller to had huge tits.

578
00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:39.490
You know that big bits.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Gold sequins.
Tina do stand up.
Thank you.

579
00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:44.080
My mother in law,
but I've had women in the past.
Tell me,

580
00:38:44.081 --> 00:38:46.480
you should show him off and I'm like,
no one's going to listen to me.

581
00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:51.070
Probably is distracting.
Exactly.
It's going to take away from your actual talent,

582
00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.590
right?
Yes.
I agree.

583
00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:56.530
Long legs with heels and stuff.
You're like,

584
00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:59.880
people aren't listening to what you're saying.
They're looking at your finger,

585
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.140
not going to take you serious and they're going to be like,

586
00:39:02.141 --> 00:39:06.600
is your Vagina Sankey?
They might like you know,

587
00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:09.370
well for,
and also when I first started doing it,

588
00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.830
I think Rogan's is and tell me that she's like,

589
00:39:11.831 --> 00:39:16.060
you don't want to show your tattoos.
It's distracting.
It's really,
he's like,
yeah,

590
00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:21.150
but if I do so like I'm in San Francisco this this week,
if I'm,

591
00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:24.340
so that's my crap.
They all know I have tattoos.
It's different.

592
00:39:24.341 --> 00:39:28.650
But if I'm at the comedy store,
laugh,
track three or Improv,
I covered my tattoos.

593
00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:31.540
That's interesting.
I think there's a,
there's a lot to be said for that.

594
00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:36.670
I noticed for years now when I would tour with Joe that a,

595
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.740
he'd do a big show.
It was there.
Even when he would shoot,

596
00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:42.130
he would wear like baggy long sleeve shirt.
Always.
Always,

597
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:46.180
never like showing that he's in shape.
Never showing the tattoos because,

598
00:39:46.181 --> 00:39:47.830
and you're like,
oh yeah,
it just looks like a black shirt.

599
00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:51.660
Like you just don't even think about it.
You listen to what he says exactly.
Um,

600
00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:55.360
but I've never heard it from a male perspective because I've only ever heard it

601
00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:59.620
dealt with it as a female comedy.
But I guess guys struggle too.
For sure.
Well,

602
00:39:59.621 --> 00:40:02.610
I'm already in.
I don't mean to interrupt.
I'm like,

603
00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:06.180
I'm way too into fashion where if you guys didn't know I was engaged like Oh,

604
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:09.970
he's gay as shit.
Yes.
I'm super into fashion.
I everybody thinks you're good.

605
00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:14.830
Yeah,
it's pretty,
yeah,
that's fair point.
But um,

606
00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:18.640
I'm super into fashion super into fashion where I'll pick up my out like I'm

607
00:40:18.641 --> 00:40:21.010
outfit picked out for Thursday night show already.

608
00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:24.800
I might have picked up for next Friday's show already.
Yeah,
I like it.

609
00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:27.053
I bet you do.

610
00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:30.260
Do you pick out your own outfits or do you have a stylist if you looked at it?

611
00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:33.700
I'm liking.
Ah,
no,
like I,
I,

612
00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:36.220
you'd have swagged it was stylish for one,

613
00:40:36.221 --> 00:40:40.690
for like one time when I was doing this thing on e and like we talked back and

614
00:40:40.691 --> 00:40:42.550
forth.
I'm just like,
what?
You don't know what the fuck?

615
00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:45.160
Like I know what's in like,
you're so old school lady,

616
00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:49.690
you know what worked for Jared.
Leto isn't going to work for me.

617
00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:52.750
We got one for you though,
if you want.
If you want to try someone else.
Oh yeah.

618
00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:57.740
For Real.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We've got some of the,
all the stars,
the dudes,

619
00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:01.870
it was tight.
You're like it,
like you hired them for your special maybe,

620
00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:02.733
I don't know.

621
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.730
I sent the bill to my manager and they were like,
oh my God,
what are you wearing?

622
00:41:09.731 --> 00:41:11.540
I was like,
no,
no.
He gave me a bunch of shit.

623
00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:17.260
But sometimes it's good because let's say they give you some crazy Gucci jacket

624
00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:22.150
and you do a special with that,
or you do the event with that.
Well,

625
00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:23.560
you've got to give it back to him.

626
00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:26.290
So he probably shouldn't pay for that because you can't rock that thing again.

627
00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:29.320
It's tough to rock that again.
Yeah.
I mean like you,
she has,

628
00:41:29.321 --> 00:41:33.650
she just shot a special,
and before you got here,
she started in Seattle,

629
00:41:33.651 --> 00:41:37.610
but we just announced that it's airing,
uh,
on Netflix.

630
00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:45.860
She has a,
uh,
a very fashionable Christian Dior dress.

631
00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:52.070
I can't wear it again.
But then again I have in my closet it's like,
oh,

632
00:41:52.071 --> 00:41:54.170
that's my special,
it's my first special dress.

633
00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:58.550
But it's tailored like you can't take a wedding.
No,
it's like your body.

634
00:41:58.551 --> 00:42:00.290
It's tailored perfectly.
I had to camouflage,

635
00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.750
I had mask my big tits and you know what I mean?

636
00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:06.560
You can give it to or you can give it towards his underwear.
Like when he's,

637
00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:09.470
if you have a daughter,
she switches pronouns.

638
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:22.310
I'm so glad you said that because I think it's true that like while it's open

639
00:42:22.311 --> 00:42:25.820
minded as people are at the end of the day you would be like,

640
00:42:25.821 --> 00:42:29.060
why did this shit?
I love everyone that you've seen.

641
00:42:29.061 --> 00:42:34.061
I named Kate on Tlc 12 year old girl who's born a boy,

642
00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:38.380
but she's going through the whole bottom surgery and she's in high school and

643
00:42:38.381 --> 00:42:42.710
going on blind dates and shit.
And I looked at my son's name is talking about,

644
00:42:42.711 --> 00:42:47.390
look at in 10 years she went thought fuck,
I want,
can you imagine?
And she,

645
00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:51.850
I was like,
you'd still love him.
Of course.
Nightmare,
but it would suck that.

646
00:42:51.851 --> 00:42:55.370
What's the,
at least let's not act like it wouldn't like you would.

647
00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:58.490
We would all love our children regardless,

648
00:42:58.491 --> 00:43:01.070
but that going through that will be fun

649
00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:06.490
and just as like a man,
if my son was like,
Yo Dad,
I'm gay as fuck.

650
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:10.550
You know I'm a power bottom bro.
I was like,
ah,
fuck.
He's going to take a little,

651
00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:15.020
it's going to take a little while to get used to,
oh cool man.

652
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:20.460
I'm like,
damn,
there it goes.
Kind of normal life now.

653
00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:25.790
You would adapt to whatever became for new normal.
I'm still going to love them,

654
00:43:25.791 --> 00:43:28.520
but it's going to take like with Caitlyn Jenner,
I like his language.

655
00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:31.070
When he with you though,
he's like,
I'm powered bottom as fuck bro.

656
00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:35.750
That's like,
oh my God.

657
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:39.290
Like you take a little bit like with Caitlyn Jenner thing,
like everyone's like,

658
00:43:39.291 --> 00:43:41.600
you just got to accept her.
I'm like,
I get that,

659
00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.720
but I've known her or him as Bruce Jenner,

660
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:48.620
like gimme a fucking sit on.
That's fine.
Yeah.

661
00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:52.460
What's wrong with even having the reaction of like,
Whoa,
what like that.

662
00:43:52.461 --> 00:43:55.400
Even that reaction is considered hateful.
Like,
no dude,

663
00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:01.040
I'm just for my entire life.
I'm just not used to it.
Yeah,
isn't that wild?

664
00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:05.870
Did you know that?
Like,
so you don't know his story really.
But he was a,

665
00:44:05.871 --> 00:44:07.210
I was born a woman born woman,

666
00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:12.480
clearly the first female college and went into fighting professional fighting in

667
00:44:15.141 --> 00:44:19.760
the UFC and then now he's not just a podcast and he started with standup and

668
00:44:19.761 --> 00:44:22.410
he's the one standing on the same lineup.

669
00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.011
And I'll say this,

670
00:44:25.011 --> 00:44:29.570
I told Tom this when I saw you guys run the lineup because we really haven't

671
00:44:29.571 --> 00:44:32.120
talked or met and I in the same lineup

672
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:34.440
<v 14>and that night there was a guy on there who does it too.</v>

673
00:44:34.441 --> 00:44:38.280
We do stand up and he used doing horrible and I'm a,
again,

674
00:44:38.281 --> 00:44:41.430
I'm super self conscious of that stuff because you know there's some gimmick

675
00:44:41.431 --> 00:44:42.264
acts out there.

676
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:45.960
So he was going up there and just completely bombed and you came back like,

677
00:44:45.961 --> 00:44:49.350
what the fuck is going on?
I was like fucking right.

678
00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:54.370
And then you were like,
God,
I mean how,
how these guys get up night.

679
00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.900
And I was so self conscious,
I'm like,
God,

680
00:44:57.901 --> 00:44:59.490
I hope she don't talk shit when I go out there.

681
00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:01.720
<v 9>That's an every comic thing.</v>

682
00:45:01.721 --> 00:45:06.520
So every comic who hears anyone say something in their head things like,
ah,

683
00:45:06.521 --> 00:45:08.830
shit,
wonder what they're gonna think about me every 100%.
Yeah.

684
00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:12.640
<v 14>And I'll say this and this is why I'm a ride or die for Tom.</v>

685
00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:16.130
Like I'll kill someone for Tom because I did a set at the laugh factory.

686
00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:20.080
It is a bunch of comps or delete account,
Tom,
everyone,

687
00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:23.020
you know when you first getting started,
like get the,
you know,

688
00:45:23.021 --> 00:45:25.050
you guys know how it is.
And I came up different.
He,

689
00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:28.200
my path to this has been completely different than a lot of people's for God

690
00:45:28.201 --> 00:45:31.060
sakes.
So I'm not,
I feel like Charlie Sheen doing tiger blood like you,

691
00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.790
we have no idea.
You know what I'm saying?
So,
um,

692
00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:35.990
I was doing to set the laugh factory and then you,

693
00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:40.660
Tom text me after as I came in,
uh,
you can do this like,
dude,
you can do this man.

694
00:45:40.661 --> 00:45:45.400
And just that little bit of encouragement.
Just fucking,
I mean skyrocket.

695
00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:51.030
<v 9>It's the positive route.
I do fear and hatred,
you know what I mean?</v>

696
00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:54.150
I'm like,
do I go negative so that I motivate you that,
yeah.

697
00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:58.240
<v 14>Oh,
but see what the wrong too.
But how would you motivate you that Ah,</v>

698
00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.093
not for you.

699
00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:04.100
<v 9>No.
What would you tell Brandon?
I would never discourage somebody trying.</v>

700
00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:08.120
I discourage people who don't try the hate and don't try actually met Brendan.

701
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:10.430
I was at a fight.
He doesn't even know this bit probably,

702
00:46:10.431 --> 00:46:13.250
but I met him at a fight and I cheered against him

703
00:46:16.330 --> 00:46:21.200
know,
so I was going to these fights because I was,
I was,

704
00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:24.870
I was touring with Joe Rogan's tickets.
Yeah.
But I was,
I was opening for him.

705
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:29.660
I think it was in Vancouver maybe.
Oh,
I found our Lawsky.
No,

706
00:46:29.661 --> 00:46:32.570
I think I thought you thought Mitrione though.
Oh Bitch,
you're on.
Yes.
Yes,
yes.

707
00:46:32.571 --> 00:46:36.140
So Toronto,
but I don't know.
It's trying.
Okay.
I don't know any,
I didn't,

708
00:46:36.141 --> 00:46:37.760
I didn't know anybody in the US,
you know what I mean?
Like,

709
00:46:37.761 --> 00:46:41.430
I know some of the big names sometimes,
but yeah,
I mean I'm gonna,
I'm,
I'm,
I,
I,

710
00:46:41.431 --> 00:46:42.620
you know,
I like football and stuff.

711
00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:47.000
So I'm sitting there and Callen shows up and he's like,
my boys fighting in this.

712
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:50.050
And I was like,
who's your boy?
And so we're like,
we were just like the way,

713
00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:53.990
you know,
and like,
and he's like,
he's coming up,
it's coming up.
And then he goes,

714
00:46:53.991 --> 00:46:58.220
uh,
and he's telling me about like,
this is what this guy does.
This was this guy.

715
00:46:58.221 --> 00:47:02.090
He goes,
yeah,
my boys fighting this guy.
He used to play college football.

716
00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:06.920
So then I go,
you know,
I'm like a big co who,
where he goes,
uh,
he says,

717
00:47:06.921 --> 00:47:10.700
metrio and I go,
I go,
where do you play ball?
He goes,
I thought he said Lsu.

718
00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:15.660
So I go,
Lsu.
I go,
that's my dog.
I'm like,
go,
tigers do,

719
00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:19.280
let's see.
You know,
mentioned it.
He never mentioned it.
So,

720
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:21.980
so then at the winds I go,
Yo man,
like Alex,

721
00:47:21.981 --> 00:47:26.570
he was going to fuck you up like yelling.
And then at the fights,

722
00:47:26.571 --> 00:47:30.100
man,
it was amazing.
I was sitting next Callen you

723
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:34.870
<v 14>would've thought it was Cowens seven year old son.
I mean,</v>

724
00:47:34.871 --> 00:47:38.790
he was like nervous as shit.
He was so nervous and like,

725
00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:43.380
like,
uh,
trying to get your attention like every fucking five seconds.
I was like,

726
00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:46.080
and I kept being like,
your boy's gonna get fucked up

727
00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:53.710
dude.
He was like,
he wasn't listening to anything I was saying.
He was so,

728
00:47:53.830 --> 00:47:58.830
and you won that fight and then when you won the fight he can lost his mind.

729
00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:03.640
Yeah,
dude,
he,
he was,
he was like,
it was like a father and son,

730
00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:07.390
which he could be since he's that much older than you.
100%.
My Dad,

731
00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:09.890
my best friend's about 53 minutes.

732
00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:15.460
What's crazy about that fight?
That was like the kind of one,

733
00:48:15.461 --> 00:48:19.720
the first steps into me transitioning from swinging of Caitlyn Jenner,

734
00:48:19.721 --> 00:48:24.721
but me transitioning from a kind of that arena into entertainment through

735
00:48:24.821 --> 00:48:28.460
podcasting.
Because especially at the time,
there's no Reebok deal.

736
00:48:28.461 --> 00:48:31.330
I want to get too much into that,
but you could wear any sponsor you want.

737
00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:36.070
So I could wear a,
uh,
you know,
uh,
your guys' podcast shirt out.

738
00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:38.470
I could wear Reebok,
Nike,
whoever I want to.

739
00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:41.890
And so for that particular fight I wore our podcast shirt,

740
00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:43.570
Abbot Kinney Fight Club podcast.

741
00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:47.530
And so I turned down money from these companies to where my own podcasts.

742
00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:51.310
You were a big baller brand before big baller brand.
Exactly.
The UFC was like,

743
00:48:51.311 --> 00:48:54.380
you're an idiot.
And I was like,
that's fine.
Let me wear my podcast smart.

744
00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:56.320
That's where it started to take.
That's crazy.

745
00:48:57.030 --> 00:49:01.330
School and podcasting has exploded for you guys.
Yeah,
it's been good man.

746
00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:02.980
Which you know what's crazy,

747
00:49:02.981 --> 00:49:06.010
you know a lot of fighters or try and match it with comedians because they think

748
00:49:06.011 --> 00:49:08.330
that's what makes the fire in the kid.
But it's not.

749
00:49:08.331 --> 00:49:11.350
And that's your guys' chemistry.
Yeah.
Cause you have two best friends talking.

750
00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:15.460
We don't really even talk about sports,
talking about life girls,
whatever,

751
00:49:15.461 --> 00:49:19.450
politics and current events.
But,
so you see a lot of people try and copy it,

752
00:49:19.451 --> 00:49:20.690
which is flattering.
But,

753
00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:24.550
so they get some fighter who is better than me and some comic more famous and

754
00:49:24.551 --> 00:49:28.420
Callan,
you'll hear,
do a podcast.
We assist success like those guys.

755
00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:31.540
It just doesn't work.
No,
it's lightning in a bottle.
It's chemistry,

756
00:49:31.541 --> 00:49:35.200
which you can't duplicate.
And totally man trail.
And then,

757
00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:37.990
and then we started doing live shows.
That was Karen's idea.

758
00:49:37.991 --> 00:49:42.370
And then I left that old man and the dust and who I am.
It's crazy.

759
00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:48.970
I don't know.
Okay.
And UFC stuff,
do they talk shit?

760
00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:51.040
Is it,
is it like boxing?
For sure.

761
00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:58.140
I remember more so than boxing.
Let's talk about how do you plan your shit?

762
00:49:58.141 --> 00:50:02.470
How the,
uh,
the,
at least the way of that,
me and metro and you guys were talking,

763
00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:06.820
Matt.
So Matt and I were friends before the fight,
way before.

764
00:50:06.821 --> 00:50:09.070
We're on the ultimate fighter together,
which is a reality show.

765
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:11.440
We're on that together.
And we had a trainer before that,

766
00:50:11.441 --> 00:50:14.110
so me and Matt and I've always been bonded one way or another.

767
00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:19.090
So when they called us to fight,
um,
I got a text from my manager and I'm like,

768
00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:22.270
oh fuck.
Then when we fight,
man,
I want to fight Matt.
And so I texted him like,

769
00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:26.770
hey bro,
I just got an offer to fight you in Toronto.
And Matt's like,
what?

770
00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:29.630
And he goes,
oh,
I just got down for two.
And I was like,
well,

771
00:50:29.631 --> 00:50:32.910
we can't turn it down.
She can't do now in fights,
the bad luck.
Um,

772
00:50:32.911 --> 00:50:36.620
and I thought I'm matched up well with Matt and you know,
got to eat.
So,
um,

773
00:50:36.621 --> 00:50:39.590
I texted him,
I just said,
hey,
I'm going to accept the fight.

774
00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:43.130
Let's sell the shit out of this thing.
Let's just talk as much shit as we can.

775
00:50:43.131 --> 00:50:47.210
So there is that element most most time.
There's not in a sic,

776
00:50:47.211 --> 00:50:50.070
let's talk as much shit as we can.
Don't take anything personal.

777
00:50:50.071 --> 00:50:53.660
I'm gonna say some roots shit.
He put got it,
have fun,

778
00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:56.450
see you the date of the fight.
And I,
but cool man.

779
00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.950
And so he starts talking shit to me on social media and he's like,

780
00:51:00.951 --> 00:51:03.740
you look like you have down you and uh,
you,

781
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:08.240
you look like Adam Sandler and a down syndrome mom had a kid.
And I put,

782
00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:13.310
I put,
and this is true,
I put,
yeah,
we'll in a times going through a divorce,
I,

783
00:51:13.311 --> 00:51:13.791
but yeah,

784
00:51:13.791 --> 00:51:16.760
that's not what your wife was saying when we had that mean greet together.

785
00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:20.150
She was,
I fucking me.
And then he just took offense to that.

786
00:51:20.151 --> 00:51:24.160
And when was I texted my cow dairy and then he got serious and they have to

787
00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:28.990
fight.
He was dead serious.
Yeah.
And how about after that?
Oh,
we're cool.
Cool.

788
00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:33.830
Cool.
Yeah,
so I just did a,
uh,
commentating job for his biggest fight of his life.

789
00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:37.070
He thought mass square guttering,
it's fate or,
and how's the commentator on it?

790
00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:41.890
Kind of psycho.
He Won.
He knocked.
Oh,
cool man.
30 seconds.
So I saw him after.

791
00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:43.860
I mean,
we're good.
He's been on my show.
It does

792
00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:45.340
<v 9>now as a very,
like I said,</v>

793
00:51:45.341 --> 00:51:50.341
very casual and there wasn't a fade or like an indestructable at some point.

794
00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:54.020
He's just older,
so it'd be like,
it'd be like a,

795
00:51:54.490 --> 00:51:58.660
Terry brought Bradshaw all playing for papers Steelers.
But there was a moment,

796
00:51:58.661 --> 00:52:00.670
right there was a moment was the best of all time.
People were like,

797
00:52:00.671 --> 00:52:03.130
this guy is like,
yeah,
but then testing kicks in,

798
00:52:03.131 --> 00:52:05.350
competition gets better and he's a little old school,
you know what I'm saying?

799
00:52:05.351 --> 00:52:08.480
It's not good for metro.
Put Jim Brown at running back like,
mm.

800
00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:12.400
Wasn't even really good.
Like you're fucking grip ago.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's like that.

801
00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:19.710
Are you in a football team?
I know nothing,
Bro.
I am a woman.
You know what I mean?

802
00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:24.760
I don't know.
Football man.
I do love you.
So crunk gets here.

803
00:52:25.330 --> 00:52:26.740
I'm super excited.
But you know,

804
00:52:26.741 --> 00:52:30.730
I'm a big seminal fan and our quarterbacks out for the season,

805
00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:35.470
game one and then you go off.
Tough opener.
Fuck yeah,
it was man.

806
00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:37.750
And there was,
and they caught someone lucky breaks and I mean,

807
00:52:37.751 --> 00:52:42.430
that game could have been a closer game,
but I go,
tough game.
It's a tough game.

808
00:52:42.431 --> 00:52:47.020
Yeah.
It's a tough game to opal with.
But I still go like,
ah,
man.
Like if he'd be,

809
00:52:47.050 --> 00:52:50.680
if he was healthy coming out of that game,
you know,
I still feel fine.

810
00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:54.430
Oh definitely.
Great ball making the playoffs with a backup in.

811
00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:58.060
It's going to be able to state though like the,
the backups going to be a stuck.

812
00:52:58.090 --> 00:52:59.560
He's,
he's six,
five,

813
00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:03.400
one 85 and their whole line is suspect.

814
00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.830
I mean that kid trouble France while I was getting hit,

815
00:53:05.831 --> 00:53:08.410
like you would not believe it's also Alabama.
This guy I know,

816
00:53:08.411 --> 00:53:13.090
but this guy weighs one 85 about to get crumbs.
I mean we're gonna have,

817
00:53:13.091 --> 00:53:15.100
we're gonna have it tied in throwing the baseball be dealt with.

818
00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:16.630
It's going to be,
it's gonna be rough man.

819
00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:24.370
So theoretically these are your friends that you're fighting with,

820
00:53:24.371 --> 00:53:28.890
correct?
It's,
it's your,
it's like,
it's like no,
in a comic it's like me Texting,

821
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:32.340
I dunno,
Ari and being like,
hey dude,
I'm gonna fucking beat your face in,

822
00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:36.420
in three months exists with roasts.
Right?
Cause you roast friends.
That's true.

823
00:53:36.421 --> 00:53:39.240
But it's not physical.
Like I'm saying like he loves people like us all.

824
00:53:39.241 --> 00:53:42.770
Ralphie may get his feelings hurt.
Yeah,
I've heard about this.
And that's,

825
00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:43.530
that's happened.

826
00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:48.030
I mean Ralphie's was highly publicized but it's also happened on ones that don't

827
00:53:48.031 --> 00:53:52.950
air where you hear about somebody getting real upset like in the back.
Yeah.

828
00:53:52.951 --> 00:53:55.710
Like sometimes people who are like the fuck and you're like,
I've,

829
00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:57.810
I've heard comics.
So you know how when you play,

830
00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:01.680
when you do like tag off where there's no host,
what do you call it?
Yeah,

831
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:04.730
team tacting so when they have to introduce the next time,

832
00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:07.580
I've had comics roast off fuck out of me before I get up there.

833
00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:11.610
I mean the thing about those roasts,

834
00:54:11.611 --> 00:54:15.120
it's weird to me is when it's not friends.

835
00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:19.770
I wouldn't mind being roasted by friends for sure.

836
00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:23.730
I mean I'd sign up being funny.
Yeah.
But like when,
when I understand almost,

837
00:54:23.731 --> 00:54:26.520
I think when some of the people get upset at the road cause they're getting

838
00:54:26.521 --> 00:54:28.200
roasted by people they don't know.

839
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:33.240
And that's why it's Blasa who gets upset at a roast.
I agree.

840
00:54:33.241 --> 00:54:34.770
But I think that's why they get upset.

841
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:37.710
It's because they end up getting slammed by someone.
They're like,

842
00:54:37.711 --> 00:54:39.990
who the fuck are you?
You shouldn't get upset.

843
00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.570
But you also shouldn't sign up for this cause that definitely is a no,

844
00:54:42.571 --> 00:54:46.980
you meant asking him to physicality.
Like how do you like you theoretical,

845
00:54:46.981 --> 00:54:49.540
you like the person that you're going to fire.
Right.
So how,

846
00:54:49.570 --> 00:54:52.710
I know it's not like I'm fighting Brian Cowen like,
like me and Matt,

847
00:54:52.711 --> 00:54:55.170
we're friends but we're friends through the business,
you know?

848
00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:58.560
So it's just part of the game.
Yeah.
So what'd you fight a friend?

849
00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:02.580
Could you even do it physically?
I mean now definitely not.

850
00:55:02.581 --> 00:55:04.740
When I was fighting is almost,
you know,
even guys,

851
00:55:04.741 --> 00:55:08.610
I didn't know I had a problem hurting.
Like every fight I've ever had,

852
00:55:08.611 --> 00:55:10.320
I always went to the back and like Yo Bro,
you all right.

853
00:55:10.321 --> 00:55:13.380
Well even if I lost like,
hey man,
you good?
I'm like,
yeah,
get the fuck out.

854
00:55:13.381 --> 00:55:15.600
I'm like,
I just check.
What is it like I always,

855
00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:18.810
I imagine too nice to be like nice to be a world champion.

856
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:21.140
Kind of a gentle giant as way too nice to be.

857
00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:25.650
What's the anxiety like walking to the,
Oh my God.
The worst it is,
right?

858
00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:29.060
So work cause I was here a fun.

859
00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:33.670
Did you shut a lie or Maria Ho vomit not to pee nonstop.
Never.

860
00:55:33.671 --> 00:55:35.980
It never diarrhea but always had,
I was like God,

861
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:40.760
he's so much cause I drink fluids and then for every file,
every,

862
00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:43.980
every fight.
So for the last one is a little different.
Before I retired,

863
00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:47.730
every fight I'd be in the back going,
what the fuck am I doing?
What am I doing?

864
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:49.640
Like I get to go out.
You're,

865
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:53.100
you're seeing the movie gladiator when they're about to go out and he's chained

866
00:55:53.101 --> 00:55:57.510
to that dude.
He looks down,
he's pissing his pants.
It's just,
it felt so barbaric.

867
00:55:57.690 --> 00:55:59.850
It is nuts.
Now how about this,
cause I,

868
00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:02.970
I actually didn't know this until I was reading about you sometime.

869
00:56:02.971 --> 00:56:06.020
I was reading something that you were golden gloves.
Yeah.

870
00:56:06.021 --> 00:56:10.620
It was a golden gloves champion in Colorado.
Yeah.
But when did you start boxing?

871
00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:15.500
So I only started boxing to pursue the UFC to get them and maybe kill.

872
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:19.050
Was it after?
It was so I started doing like,

873
00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:23.200
like messing around.
Boxing was in college and training.
Can I do it?

874
00:56:23.201 --> 00:56:24.010
Just stay in shape for

875
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:28.420
<v 14>football.
And then I was like,
Dang,
I'm not bad.
And then went to the NFL,</v>

876
00:56:28.421 --> 00:56:30.690
had literally a cup of tea with the buffalo bills.

877
00:56:30.691 --> 00:56:33.790
They're like raw set on white guys and then sent me back home and I was like,

878
00:56:33.791 --> 00:56:38.440
what the fuck am I going to do?
And then enter the Jitsu competition,
uh,

879
00:56:38.441 --> 00:56:43.270
one that,
and then you had no Jujitsu training.
I had like a six months,

880
00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:47.080
eight months of training one that,
and then,
uh,

881
00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:49.980
the guy was trained with that time.
Shane Carlan who's UFC heavyweight champ.

882
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:55.240
He goes,
Hey,
uh,
next week is going gloves.
I'm like,
oh that's cool.
Boring as shit.

883
00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:58.570
Let's go.
He's like,
I signed you up for it.
I'm like,
what?
He's like,
yeah,

884
00:56:58.571 --> 00:57:03.350
you're in it man.
Cause I was sparring with him on and off and so he took to,

885
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:04.263
do you think,
I mean,

886
00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:08.080
is it one of those things where you took to it naturally box?
Some of it.

887
00:57:08.081 --> 00:57:11.590
I just outworked everyone to be honest.
Like my,
yeah,
like I just,

888
00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:13.960
I wanted it more like,
especially in like golden gloves.

889
00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:19.420
I had like eight fights and I had,
I had all eight stoppages,

890
00:57:19.421 --> 00:57:23.860
nothing went to decision.
So it was just like,
I,
it's just your,
your heart,

891
00:57:23.861 --> 00:57:27.340
especially when you're starting out like it to have a big heart.
I mean,
so much.

892
00:57:27.370 --> 00:57:29.830
Wow.
I also have a lot of their options,

893
00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:34.330
so coming out ways that are fucking teaching moms cardio,
kickboxing.

894
00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:37.300
I gotta make it here,
man.
That's the goal with my brother.

895
00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:38.980
My truck was getting repoed.
I'm like,

896
00:57:38.981 --> 00:57:42.470
what the fuck am I going to do when you graduated Colorado,
right?
Yeah.

897
00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:47.470
And then do you get,
like,
you have NFL hopes at that point?
Oh my God,

898
00:57:47.471 --> 00:57:51.040
this is my dream.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So how does that,
like,
what's the process like?

899
00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:55.200
Like there's obviously like there's combine people and the draft and then you

900
00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:56.900
get an agent and you're like,
look,
I mean,
yeah,

901
00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:01.210
you get an agent like right in between.
So we went to a ball every year.

902
00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:04.060
Let's see,
every year I played in the big 12 championship,

903
00:58:04.210 --> 00:58:05.650
so he can play in big talk,
jump ship,

904
00:58:05.651 --> 00:58:08.860
and then you get to Bulger right in between that bowl game.
Uh,

905
00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:11.410
usually talking to agents,
you kind of have an idea.

906
00:58:11.650 --> 00:58:13.940
I had some coming my way and they're like,
yeah,

907
00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:18.550
maybe late round draft pick free agent.
We'll see.
So then you watch the draft,

908
00:58:18.551 --> 00:58:19.450
don't get picked up.

909
00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:22.720
Best friend get strapped in the sec around the met is draft party brokenhearted

910
00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:27.040
and then nothing happens.
Then weeks later like hey buffalo,

911
00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:30.250
the buffalo is going to,
you know,
bring in to train.

912
00:58:30.251 --> 00:58:33.250
What happens when you get that call?
And I was at like static.

913
00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:36.470
Yeah you're just like fucking flying right flying.
But I knew it was,

914
00:58:36.471 --> 00:58:39.250
I was still a long shot cause their,
it's like hey,
someone got hurt.

915
00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:43.270
They need a body basically if you're super gifted you might make the team.

916
00:58:43.450 --> 00:58:47.260
So I remember flying down there,
tell him my family and friends like,
dude,

917
00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:50.590
I know how this game goes.
A chance of me making this team are not fucking good.

918
00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:54.160
Don't get all crazy.
You know you're flying into buffalo,
flying into Buffalo.

919
00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:56.530
And so I fly to Buffalo,
get off the plane,

920
00:58:56.770 --> 00:59:00.880
go through like this weird little combine worked out and I'm there for not that

921
00:59:00.881 --> 00:59:05.800
long.
A few days I injured my hamstring but to me it was like,
it,

922
00:59:05.801 --> 00:59:07.390
it broke my heart right away.
Right.

923
00:59:07.391 --> 00:59:11.350
I'm a sensitive person but I realized how much of a business it was cause I get

924
00:59:11.351 --> 00:59:14.140
there in like 43 you over there.
I'm like,
well my name's Brendan.

925
00:59:14.141 --> 00:59:18.010
Like what the fuck over there?
And again,
no doubt.
And then it's just like,

926
00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:21.200
it was just such a business that broke my heart.
It was like,

927
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:24.230
you know your entire life you want to get to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.

928
00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:26.760
You get in there and you're like,
God,
they treat these midgets.

929
00:59:26.770 --> 00:59:29.930
And it's also crazy how like when you,

930
00:59:29.931 --> 00:59:32.880
if you follow just like the NFL news ticker,
you know,

931
00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:36.210
it'll be like big name guys and they're like release today and you know,

932
00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:38.090
he's released and it's like well it's this much.

933
00:59:38.091 --> 00:59:39.350
He was going to owe against the cap.

934
00:59:39.351 --> 00:59:42.980
So they just cut the bring in a young guy and some other guy came up and then it

935
00:59:42.981 --> 00:59:43.820
really becomes like,

936
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:46.820
like it was just such a business and you don't really think about that when

937
00:59:46.821 --> 00:59:47.720
you're a kid.
You know,

938
00:59:47.721 --> 00:59:51.170
like you just think you're going to get there and a semi all rainbows and Molly

939
00:59:51.171 --> 00:59:55.160
and to be a good time.
It was not the case and that's how I was like,
oh my God.

940
00:59:55.161 --> 00:59:57.170
And even towards senior year I'm like,
oh,

941
00:59:57.171 --> 00:59:58.310
I don't want to do this for the rest of my life.

942
00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:00.590
I don't play football the rest of my life.
Like my,

943
01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:02.480
my dream when I was kids be on Saturday night live.

944
01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:05.900
Like I was obsessed with Jim Carrey,
Adam Sandler,
I was just gifted.

945
01:00:05.901 --> 01:00:07.870
I was just the big for you.

946
01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:12.110
You had sex with a retarded Sandler.
Yeah.
There you go.

947
01:00:12.111 --> 01:00:16.910
Corn to Matt mature.
Oh,
as part of your dream.
Yeah.
There you go man.

948
01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:18.760
So for me it just,
it,
it,

949
01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:23.660
it was eye opening and it was a good experience and led me to where I'm at now.

950
01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:26.750
But yeah,
you've had it.
You've come with now.
Uh,

951
01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:30.140
do you remember in college you played,
you said,
and he's big 12 games.

952
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:33.650
You ever playing against any big name players today?
I'm a big name.

953
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:38.270
I mean I played hard,
played against uh,
Shit,

I played uh,

954
01:00:38.271 --> 01:00:39.860
Oklahoma when they had Adrian Peterson.

955
01:00:39.861 --> 01:00:42.910
Who won the Heisman against in Jason White.
Had the Heisman.
Yeah.

956
01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:44.990
Would be this 50 to nothing.
All my city,

957
01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:48.980
I played against Vince young when they won the last championship against USC.

958
01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:52.340
Do you remember some things,
the best college team help time you played?

959
01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:55.950
He beat US 70 to three.
Wow.

960
01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:59.540
And I was on kickoff return.
Oh,
it was horrible.

961
01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:03.500
And I was going against this freak who made mate to the NFL and I mean,

962
01:01:03.501 --> 01:01:07.700
how many fucking kickoffs is that?
And he,
every time don't touch me white boy.

963
01:01:07.701 --> 01:01:09.770
I'm like,
Bro,
you guys are going a lot of points.

964
01:01:09.771 --> 01:01:13.430
I have to touch you like to football.
I have to touch you man.
Don't touch me.

965
01:01:13.431 --> 01:01:15.500
Fucking white boy.
I'm like,
dude,
I'm just,
that's what you get to see.

966
01:01:15.501 --> 01:01:18.950
That's the kind of shit.
I love that shit.
Talking on the field,
you know,

967
01:01:18.951 --> 01:01:23.810
don't touch me white boy.
When you're fight,
when you were fighting MMA stuff,

968
01:01:23.811 --> 01:01:28.450
do you talk shit?
Why are fighting a dude?
Yeah.

969
01:01:28.610 --> 01:01:30.980
Yeah.
See that's what I got a lot,
you know,
reverse racism.

970
01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:35.450
Don't touch me white boy please.
You don't see Miami.
It's all they said to me.

971
01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:42.530
So I'd be a long day.
That's what they really,
well you played Miami.

972
01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:47.220
He played at Miami at Miami.
That is the epicenter of time.

973
01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:49.310
Me and just hot as fuck.

974
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:53.870
So I think Sonora smoss caught this ball.
I was like,

975
01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:58.280
oh my God,
we're him for a long day.
You played tight end,

976
01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:01.790
the tight end fullback,
a fullback,
HBAC.
But I was a,

977
01:02:01.791 --> 01:02:06.080
I was also on all the special teams saw my God freaks man.
Freaks,
freaks.

978
01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:08.900
So,
uh,
do you remember,

979
01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:12.500
is there like when you think back against the Texas team and Oklahoma,

980
01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:17.180
just like,
do you ever have those hits where you're like,
oh,

981
01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:20.010
like this dude,
I'll you in high

982
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:22.470
<v 0>school I played against Heath Evans.
Oh yeah.</v>

983
01:02:22.590 --> 01:02:24.520
Who played in the NFL for like 10 years for sure.

984
01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:28.770
And to this day I've talked to friends of mine that were on those teams.

985
01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:34.160
We still remember what it was like to hit or be hit by leaf because it was so

986
01:02:34.771 --> 01:02:35.580
different.

987
01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:40.500
Like he was such a beast that like even if you hit him in the Backfield,

988
01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:43.730
like your head shook and you're like,
ah,
yes,
like Jesus.
Yeah,

989
01:02:43.731 --> 01:02:47.490
it's like a freight train took off.
You know,
it was like,
it was another level.

990
01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:51.300
So I don't know if like in those games,
but you're playing against all studs,

991
01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:55.950
but like all some of those guys are even crazier.
Right.
I'm trying to think.

992
01:02:55.951 --> 01:02:56.910
There was like,

993
01:02:58.450 --> 01:03:01.550
<v 14>I see,
I never had,
cause I was on a,
I was on the offense,</v>

994
01:03:01.551 --> 01:03:04.880
but I remember seeing agent Ph and he was a freshman or sophomore in the hand,

995
01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:07.040
the ball off to him and it was like tech mobile.

996
01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:09.640
We're just keep hitting and he's just fucking sleeping guys.

997
01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:14.280
And I remember Ron just like,
oh my God,
how such a,
how do people tackle him?
Yeah.

998
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:18.440
Like what are we going to do?
Yeah,
they score whatever 50 points in a row.

999
01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:20.810
And I was just like,
I don't,
how has he not done,

1000
01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:24.260
how's he liking be the best in the world was those are the longest rides home,

1001
01:03:24.261 --> 01:03:25.350
right?
Like after those games?
Well,

1002
01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:29.350
I think the heartbreaking thing is identify salt Takeo spikes.
Yeah.

1003
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:32.870
He's a linebacker and he has literally traps from here to here.
Yeah.

1004
01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:37.100
He's as dark as this table and what you're doing.
Hitting drills.

1005
01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.850
And he had his shirt off and I'm just like,
well,

1006
01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:42.710
we don't even look like the same species.
Like what the,

1007
01:03:42.711 --> 01:03:44.030
how the fuck am I gonna make the team?

1008
01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:47.860
<v 9>And you're like a big dude.
That's a nice shit.
Can Be like,
as far as I know,</v>

1009
01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:50.700
a UFC heavyweight or NFL play.
I'm just,
um,

1010
01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:54.730
I guess I've never seen a football player except for a Jay when he came over to

1011
01:03:54.731 --> 01:03:58.230
our house.
A hawk.
Yes.
He's a stud.
There's to kill spike.

1012
01:03:58.610 --> 01:04:01.840
Spike's look at his neck.
I mean,
what are you going to do?
You're right.

1013
01:04:02.890 --> 01:04:05.680
It's wider than his face.
No,
you could have muscle here.

1014
01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:10.340
That's a knack is wider than his whole face.
Man Freak.

1015
01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:14.530
This is problems for you.
This is a problem.
This d has stopped.

1016
01:04:14.531 --> 01:04:17.760
You should just been like,
go get a job.
It's like this ain't for you.

1017
01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:21.630
Like go get a job.
What are you doing white boy.
I'm like you have.

1018
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:25.900
That's a great point.
I think Christina and I are definitely interested in we,

1019
01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:30.530
we bring this up as often as we can love.
That's where

1020
01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:34.240
I was going to go there.

1021
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:43.240
<v 15>Diverse
cycled</v>

1022
01:04:43.490 --> 01:04:47.970
<v 9>where the difficult task.
Some first questions.
I even wrote it down.
It's funny,</v>

1023
01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:51.770
you and I are in the same way of like,
oh,
we're really talking about Dick.

1024
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:55.860
All right.
What's up though?
They speak my language.

1025
01:04:56.610 --> 01:05:01.260
Fuck these black athletes.
I bet Takeo spikes.
Tick looks a lot like his neck.

1026
01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:04.440
Well,
let,
let's put back that ass up thick.
I'll tell.

1027
01:05:04.441 --> 01:05:08.790
I'll tell you about the biggest one I've ever seen.
I know.
First of all,

1028
01:05:08.791 --> 01:05:10.320
I'd like to ask a very important question.

1029
01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:15.060
Who's balls were smelly or MMA fighters or football players or are weird

1030
01:05:15.061 --> 01:05:18.310
questions?
I say slope.
I propeller opening a clip.

1031
01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:21.580
<v 0>I would say I'd say football because you had this big stinky lineman who don't</v>

1032
01:05:21.581 --> 01:05:25.450
really give a fuck about hygienic hygiene.
And my friend Josh Potter,

1033
01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:30.290
we always have this conversation.
Okay,
Josh Do.
Josh is a comic and he,

1034
01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:31.830
he's from Buffalo and uh,

1035
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:37.060
he says which position has the cleanest assholes in the NFL and the dirtiest and

1036
01:05:37.061 --> 01:05:40.030
cleanness to be senator.
Oh,
see he,
no,
he disagrees.

1037
01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:45.060
He says that like quarterbacks have like a one like and corners and the wide

1038
01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:50.200
receivers Tivas just like diva superclean assholes.

1039
01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:54.220
And that basically the argument comes down to o line and dealer and this is

1040
01:05:54.221 --> 01:05:56.590
where we,
we've often had a heated debate.

1041
01:05:57.030 --> 01:06:00.300
I that's sloppy ass fat ass.
Oh.

1042
01:06:00.450 --> 01:06:04.840
And have to have the dirtiest assholes.
He says it's d linemen.

1043
01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:08.710
And part of his theory is that the,
the aggression,

1044
01:06:08.711 --> 01:06:13.200
the chasing if you will,
makes it a sign guy.

1045
01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:17.490
We just saw the picture of what's his position.
He was a linebacker.
His ass.

1046
01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:22.390
I mean it depends,
it's case to case.
Yeah,
that's the case.
I mean,

1047
01:06:22.391 --> 01:06:23.770
is he a Mike as you will

1048
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:31.360
see a weak side.
I mean,
you know it's a strong side running a three floor.

1049
01:06:31.361 --> 01:06:33.760
They were in the fourth,
I don't know.
You know it's he blitz all the time.

1050
01:06:34.330 --> 01:06:37.060
There's a lot of variables,
but coverage linebacker,
what are we thought about?

1051
01:06:37.061 --> 01:06:40.140
I mean this guy dropping back and zone.
What's he doing?
So,

1052
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:44.950
but Paul Humor.
Nice.
A lot of,
a lot of football.
Asshole humor though.

1053
01:06:45.970 --> 01:06:49.860
See,
I think center because they know,
they know the ones that school's getting.

1054
01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:52.210
It played with Sophie of Tom Brady putting that,

1055
01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:55.390
those hands that those golden hands underneath your route.

1056
01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:58.150
You would never disrespect that.
No,
it's Tom Brady son.

1057
01:06:58.570 --> 01:07:02.710
He's probably like that shit clean today.
Of course.
You better man.

1058
01:07:02.730 --> 01:07:05.470
I see another photograph of that gentleman.
We were,
we were looking at her like,

1059
01:07:05.471 --> 01:07:09.340
I need to see the whole body
detectives.

1060
01:07:09.341 --> 01:07:13.270
We like to guess what the person's Dick looks like.
We're talking girth,

1061
01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:14.500
length balls.

1062
01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:19.090
I play with a kid and he was a stud in the NFL too.

1063
01:07:19.091 --> 01:07:22.810
His name's Lawrence Vickers.
Why don't you guess his cock size?
Okay,
hold on.

1064
01:07:22.811 --> 01:07:25.570
Hold on.
Well,
let's look at photographs first.
Jesus,

1065
01:07:25.571 --> 01:07:29.020
look at God.
How tall is this guy?

1066
01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:31.930
Probably six one meat and cheese.

1067
01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:35.440
Was he way to 35 to 40?

1068
01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:39.220
Like complete rock solid,
not an ounce of fat on them.

1069
01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:41.600
Makes me look like a Dell shredding.

1070
01:07:41.890 --> 01:07:46.480
Normally I would go short fat,
coke can,
lot of girth.

1071
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:49.780
I'm going to go long and lean on the painter.
Ooh,

1072
01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:52.510
this guy and I'm going to go extra long,

1073
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:55.100
extra long and lean and then I'm going to go high and tight on the bosses.

1074
01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:56.850
Two big ass dicks for you right here.

1075
01:07:57.430 --> 01:08:02.430
Patrick Willis and to cats sitting on the bench to the best of all time,

1076
01:08:02.681 --> 01:08:05.210
but two of the best who are basically like we're about to run a train.

1077
01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:08.610
They retired enormous painters.
These guys.
So your,

1078
01:08:08.611 --> 01:08:12.500
your prediction is that there are long and lean and lean.

1079
01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:15.980
I'm seeing a lot of lean black dicks

1080
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:20.000
<v 9>usually like vein.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thickies,</v>

1081
01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:22.920
Nagle affect x,
right?
Yeah.
Like uh,
like uh,

1082
01:08:22.921 --> 01:08:26.600
again I I had a guy should a locker with what his locker was next and he's the

1083
01:08:26.601 --> 01:08:29.870
captain on our team.
His Dick was so big cause name's Lawrence Vic.

1086
01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:37.520
He joke around by Kay,

Great Leader.

Huge black neck or his balls like not bad either.

1096
01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:19.480
Is this him hearing it so under the Lord.

1097
01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:26.920
That's amazing
though.
The MMA fighters,

1098

Rashad Evans packing heat.

How about this page?
I use Google to Kaos Spike.
For some reason,

1100
01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:39.300
this picture of a Broderick Bunk Lee came up.
I bet he's got a fucking peace

1101
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:42.940

1102
01:09:42.941 --> 01:09:47.941

1103
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.360
That's his weight.
Three Oh six and that's his way.

1104

And he came in with like 7% body fat freak.
Yeah.

1105
01:09:59.550 --> 01:10:02.470
Yeah.
You're not gonna have a small Dick and be that freaky.
Oh Man.

1106
01:10:02.530 --> 01:10:05.260
It's just not the way it works.
Well that's not true,
Tom.

1107
01:10:05.261 --> 01:10:07.810
In the past you've said that it's sometimes it's,
it's,
you know,

1108
01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:12.610
irrespective of what I brought to her that she was just like a call.

1109
01:10:12.611 --> 01:10:15.250
Guys dig,
dig in short.
And I go with some short guys,

1110
01:10:15.251 --> 01:10:18.580

Kalynn has one of these sticks I've ever seen.

1111

Are you serious?
Yeah.

What?

1114
01:10:27.941 --> 01:10:29.800
At the gym or just like,
you know,
hanging around.

1115
01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:32.320
The first time I met county we are taking a piss and I,
she was telling her,

1116
01:10:32.321 --> 01:10:35.140
I looked over and just see what he's working with.
She's talking so much shit.

1117
01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:39.040
I chat to see for myself.
It's like seen a white walker.
You know what I'm saying?

1118
01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:41.380
Like a hat.
See it for myself.
Then you're like,

1119
01:10:41.381 --> 01:10:43.090
oh that's pretty impressive though.
You're not lying man.

1120
01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.460
Cause I didn't know if I could trust them or not.
But he's thick,

1121
01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:50.700
thick and long and long surprise for column B and 50 thinking long balls are

1122
01:10:51.010 --> 01:10:54.550

No,

1124
01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:14.210
<v 15>I just wanted to say
Lawrence,
Lauren's Vickers into cows</v>

01:11:14.210 --> 01:11:18.540
<v 10>back.
You're welcome here anytime.
Anytime you come on by by guys.</v>

1126
01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:20.063
Brendan,

1127
01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:23.430
I'm glad you're here today because this is the start of a brand new debate on

1128
01:11:23.431 --> 01:11:25.390
your mom's house.
Very hot topic.
Uh,

1129
01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:30.000
Tom and I were eating breakfast and in the middle of the meal he says,

1130
01:11:30.030 --> 01:11:34.830
I have to take a shit.
But then he finishes eating and then shuts after.

1131
01:11:34.831 --> 01:11:38.970
Now me on the other hand,
if I'm eating and I have to shit,
I get up,
I leave,

1132
01:11:38.971 --> 01:11:41.490
I take a shit,
I come back and I'd just eat my food cold.

1133
01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:44.270
Where are you on this side of the debate?
Well,

1134
01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:48.160
<v 9>um,
with this um,
yes,
dumpster.</v>

1135
01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:53.070
So I keep it,
I keep it sexy.
If I take a shit,

1136
01:11:53.071 --> 01:11:56.070
I just telling you what,
I just kind of disappear and then come back.

1137
01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.840
<v 10>But would you eat your entire meal?</v>

1138
01:11:57.841 --> 01:12:00.960
Would you finish your meal or would you get off during the og it up?
Yeah.

1139
01:12:00.961 --> 01:12:02.460
I don't want be uncomfortable.
That's what I'm saying.

1140
01:12:02.461 --> 01:12:06.530
Depends where I'm at though.
Em,
at home.
Am I eating with my girl at home?
Oh Man.

1141
01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:10.770
Nice restaurant.
You're far in front of her?
No.
Wow.
Keep it sexy man.

1142
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:14.250
You gotta keep it sexy.
How long have you been together?
Five years now.
That's why

1143
01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:17.800
<v 9>she does the same.
Oh yeah,
I be him.
Well,</v>

1144
01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:21.380
did you see her give her that up in here?
What did you see her give birth,

1145
01:12:21.381 --> 01:12:25.210
the section I was,
but you didn't see not and I tried to stay away from it,

1146
01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:25.730
but yeah,

1147
01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:29.340
there's like a little corner I could see through his rough serious surgery.

1148
01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:34.640
She's Mexican.
Yeah,
Mexican is,
fuck,
look at that.
Double A to,

1149
01:12:34.641 --> 01:12:37.610
you know,
hey,
the motherfucker come on here.
Hopefully his owner ain't outside.

1150
01:12:37.611 --> 01:12:39.440
You know what I'm saying?
I watch,
I went,

1151
01:12:39.441 --> 01:12:41.990
I'm doing and I don't want to cause a car come on here.

1152
01:12:41.991 --> 01:12:45.350
But you know when you're Mexican,
you know Mexican survive.
Do what they gotta do.

1153
01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:49.560
You know,
saying,
you know,
that's why we make skis.
Of course,

1154
01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:54.860
doing something that what I'm doing,
that's what we do in Mexico,
Bro.
Bro.

1155
01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:58.940
You know what he's doing?
What?
He's taking a shit outside.
Oh Wow.
Hey guys.

1156
01:12:58.941 --> 01:13:01.820
Good morning guys.
I'm here chilling thing,

1157
01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:05.270
going to shit outside saying some reason the restroom.

1158
01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:08.550
I ain't going to shit my motherfucking beds.
You know what I mean?

1159
01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:12.670
Shows I'm wearing shorts,
usually the shit of shorts.
He's just working dog

1160
01:13:14.210 --> 01:13:18.170
in a fucking regular.
Just outside.
That's what Joey did.
Had to be my son.

1161
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.750
I might be my son.
And if 20 years you can make this video.
Hey pops,

1162
01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:27.440
what's up bro?
What's up man?
Told down power bottom hog.
Just Shit my period.

1163
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:34.970
Oh my God.
Yeah,
that's him,
man.
He's gotta take a shit.
That'd be a bummer.

1164
01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:35.923
You know what I'm saying?

1165
01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:39.200
There's a motherfucking video to show you how I'm doing.

1166
01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:42.950
I know what I'm saying is,
is there anything you don't want your kid to be like?

1167
01:13:42.951 --> 01:13:45.980
Is there something you just so adamant on you don't want them to be?

1168
01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:48.040
I can't think.
I know.
You know what I,

1169
01:13:48.041 --> 01:13:51.680
I feel like it is whatever it is that you're like,
Oh God,

1170
01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:56.060
whenever you have that thought of like just so irritated by something,

1171
01:13:56.690 --> 01:14:00.730
sometimes my mind goes,
that's what's going to happen.
That's cool.
I mean,
yeah,

1172
01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:02.960
like,
and it's not necessarily like we're going to be like,

1173
01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.840
it's like when someone like when it irritates you when someone's being

1174
01:14:05.841 --> 01:14:10.070
indecisive,
if you like,
what are you going to do?
And then
my mind will go,

1175
01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:14.110
that's what that's I'm going to get as payback.
They're super negative.
Yeah,

1176
01:14:14.111 --> 01:14:16.240
that's it.
And honestly you can't help if the,

1177
01:14:16.241 --> 01:14:19.060
if super like manic depressive or something,
that'd be a bummer.

1178
01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:21.790
I used to live in your basement playing video games and shit.

1179
01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:23.670
I don't want my kid to go to,

1180
01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:27.460
I don't want him to go in the military only because I don't want my baby to die

1181
01:14:27.461 --> 01:14:31.110
in a war that's,
I just don't want that.
That's fair.

1182
01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:35.390
But what about entertainment?
Oh God,
it's a terrible,
but if he,
if he,

1183
01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:36.693
if he was,

1184
01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:42.370
I think it might be like it's just going go like extreme one way or the other.

1185
01:14:42.371 --> 01:14:44.290
It's either going to be like,
I definitely want to do what you guys want to do.

1186
01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:45.193
They're like,
what you guys,

1187
01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:50.870
I hope it's the opposite me to stand up.
I definitely hope he doesn't get it.
No,

1188
01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:53.830
not really.
Yeah man.
It's not a career path,

1189
01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:58.630
but I would recommend to most people,
you know,
it's a lot of suffering.

1190
01:14:58.631 --> 01:15:01.780
It's a lot of like the grind is real.
It's really real man.

1191
01:15:01.781 --> 01:15:06.640
And like you actually got to come in at a point where like you have success in

1192
01:15:06.641 --> 01:15:10.750
other aspects of your life to kind of hold you up as you do it.

1193
01:15:10.751 --> 01:15:15.010
But like if you were 23 I can't imagine I came to relate to it.

1194
01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:20.011
Like I can really throw it as far because I had a debate with one comic.

1195
01:15:20.471 --> 01:15:23.470
They're like,
wall while you were out playing grab ass.

1196
01:15:23.471 --> 01:15:26.410
I was on the ground and I was like,
well,
it's getting punched in the face.

1197
01:15:26.830 --> 01:15:30.850
It's a little different,
but I'm saying like,
uh,
also like,
I mean,

1198
01:15:30.851 --> 01:15:33.160
I know you could,
this is kind of being negative,

1199
01:15:33.161 --> 01:15:35.920
but like the probability of things,

1200
01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:40.720
even just like remotely working on my Solo,
I mean,

1201
01:15:40.721 --> 01:15:45.490
you have a better chance of graduating Harvard law getting a,
well,

1202
01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:49.570
because to get into Harvard,
I can sit my son down,
go look,
do this,
this and this.

1203
01:15:49.570 --> 01:15:51.670
You get into Harvard.
If my son goes,
hey,

1204
01:15:51.671 --> 01:15:55.540
I want to be the next Tom [inaudible] girl.
I go,
I guess try and do this.

1205
01:15:55.541 --> 01:15:58.930
It might lead you here and then you've got to do this and hopefully this works

1206
01:15:58.931 --> 01:16:02.770
out and they got it no more and you got to eat more and lay down and there's no,

1207
01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:07.570
there's no,
there's no blueprint.
That's one of the hardest things about showbiz.

1208
01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:10.660
He's like,
you think like,
I should follow this person's path.
And you're like,

1209
01:16:11.470 --> 01:16:15.430
everyone's path is completely different.
Completely different.

1210
01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:20.380
And they got to stay relevant.
Exactly.
Are you enjoying,
uh,

1211
01:16:20.410 --> 01:16:24.340
like,
you know,
I mean obviously like you're having success,
it's kind of wild,

1212
01:16:24.341 --> 01:16:29.290
but like are you enjoying,
you know,
figuring it out?
Best time of my life.

1213
01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:33.370
Really.
Yeah.
It's been a complete blessing,

1214
01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:37.150
which is not combining religious,
but uh,
it's just,
it's been crazy,
man.

1215
01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:37.530
It's been great.

1216
01:16:37.530 --> 01:16:41.140
I've always wanted to do this and I think just figuring things out and making it

1217
01:16:41.141 --> 01:16:45.700
work and being on the road and show business.
It's been amazing,
man.

1218
01:16:45.850 --> 01:16:48.860
Like I just had a meeting last week about,
you know,

1219
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.090
a TV show for something I've always wanted to do.
Like what?

1220
01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:55.050
I should a guy like a meeting they'd like be,
shouldn't be taking these meetings,

1221
01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:59.160
scripted show.
Uh,
no,
like a house show for,

1222
01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:03.370
because I do my podcasts,
big brown breakdown,
be like that for TB.
That's awesome.

1223
01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:08.530
That'd be great.
Be Great.
But just stuff like that.
Your dreams are coming true,

1224
01:17:08.531 --> 01:17:09.950
dude.
Yeah.
Or like,

1225
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:12.740
<v 14>like for me,
like when I,
cause I live in Santa Monica,</v>

1226
01:17:12.741 --> 01:17:15.110
so when I drive down sunset to do a set the comedy store,

1227
01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:19.910
it's like I get so excited,
man.
I get so,
so excited.
And like,

1228
01:17:19.911 --> 01:17:24.440
my biggest thing that I miss from sports was not the fighting,

1229
01:17:24.441 --> 01:17:27.740
not playing the football games were like the camaraderie with the guys and like

1230
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:30.050
bone out.
When I go to the comedy store,
when I'm in the back,

1231
01:17:30.051 --> 01:17:34.940
it's you Burt crystally a Rogan Brian.
Like it's like fuck,

1232
01:17:34.941 --> 01:17:37.790
here's the monitoring guys man.
True.
And like,
I feel safe.

1233
01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:41.840
That's the nice part that is,
I feel like the punter on the football team,

1234
01:17:41.841 --> 01:17:42.674
but I feel safe.
Yeah.

1235
01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:47.950
<v 9>You know what I'm saying?
I'm like the punter,
like exactly part of the team.</v>

1236
01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:51.220
I'm the weird punter,
but I feel safe.
But you know,

1237
01:17:51.221 --> 01:17:54.550
with a few bits I fuck up a few more years.
You'll be a long snapper

1238
01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:58.180
for the field goal kick and slowly,

1239
01:17:58.181 --> 01:18:01.620
slowly fat d linemen that still,

1240
01:18:05.050 --> 01:18:09.070
oh my God.
Uh,

1241
01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:13.540
Jean Jean Jean.

1242
01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:19.300
I have this guy.
Oh,
vocal fry.
You know about vocal fry?

1243
01:18:19.390 --> 01:18:20.740
I don't,
I kind of have it right now,

1244
01:18:20.741 --> 01:18:23.730
but it's because I'm sick when we talk too much.
No,

1245
01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:27.300
it's like when people will elongate their local,

1246
01:18:29.370 --> 01:18:34.060
oh my God.
Yeah.
So it's like we're always like pat,

1247
01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:39.540
you know,
like we're kind of obsessed with at what is that?

1248
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:42.660
Yeah.
It's like not the way people really talk,
you know?

1249
01:18:42.670 --> 01:18:46.010
And Oh my God,

1250
01:18:47.330 --> 01:18:48.163
meditation.

1251
01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:53.463
Meditation.

1252
01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:57.500
So the interesting thing about vocal fry that we did a lot of research and we've

1253
01:18:57.501 --> 01:19:01.310
been learning about,
it's just that that's completely deliberate.

1254
01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:06.720
She knows exactly what she's doing that on purpose.
Even if she's,

1255
01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:10.130
it's almost an act.
Yes.
It's a front.
It's like,
yeah,
you're

1256
01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:12.770
making your voice,
dude,

1257
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:17.180
upper class girls to sound more intelligent.

1258
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:23.270
That sounds intelligence and exclusive.
I think.
Maybe,
maybe not intelligent.

1259
01:19:23.271 --> 01:19:27.380
I think they just cool.
They think they are more exclusive.
Like I'm in a

1260
01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:35.210
house.
Would you talk?
Well I'm saying like,
I think that they're thinking like,

1261
01:19:36.190 --> 01:19:37.840
oh,
this is how Kim Todd

1262
01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:45.370
super hard and you really like suck Cox with

1263
01:19:48.270 --> 01:19:50.900
the first day.

1264
01:19:53.130 --> 01:19:56.870
Speak to this too.

1265
01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:00.380
Like it makes them sound smarter.
But why smarter?

1266
01:20:00.381 --> 01:20:02.950
I don't think it makes us think it's supposed to be like a,
yeah,

1267
01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:07.170
it's like a cool thing to do.
That's why it's like the,

1268
01:20:07.210 --> 01:20:08.400
the kind of cliche

1269
01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:10.140
<v 14>thing to do right now.
It'll phase out.</v>

1270
01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:11.750
<v 0>I hope so.
Yeah.</v>

1271
01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:15.020
So the first thing that you want to do that when you're starting a meditation

1272
01:20:15.021 --> 01:20:17.120
was get a good comfortable seat.

1273
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:21.230
I'm comfortable sitting up on a cushion.
Oh by God.

1274
01:20:21.231 --> 01:20:23.300
Hers is outrageous style.

1275
01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:29.110
One foot is in front of the other and my vagina crossed out of line up in front

1276
01:20:30.591 --> 01:20:34.790
of each other.
Well,
yeah,
you can't have that.

1277
01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:36.220
And what you do,

1278
01:20:36.221 --> 01:20:40.040
is there some for guys when they talk like that now guys just do talk.
No,

1279
01:20:40.610 --> 01:20:44.420
there's actually a fighter fighter does the talks like that who took the
blanket?

1280
01:20:44.421 --> 01:20:48.820
He was a world class boy tie fighter up.
Oh yes.
Yes.

1281
01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:52.740
And however you need.
And his is one of the worst cases.
Yes,
yes.

1282
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:56.060
Really have audio of him.
But I can pull it out.
No guy recently though,

1283
01:20:56.110 --> 01:20:59.270
like there's no guy and this guy,
I'm talking like this.
Yeah.
Listen to this guy.

1284
01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:03.530
Yeah.
Megan and I have been together for nearly three years.

1285
01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:07.550
She's a beautiful girl who I'm very much in love with and I have a lot in common

1286
01:21:07.551 --> 01:21:12.210
with.
I can't wait to get home.
And he's like,
no,
dude,
that's a real dude.
He um,

1287
01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:13.100
what's that show called?

1288
01:21:13.210 --> 01:21:16.210
<v 14>Uh,
polyamory.
Oh,</v>

1289
01:21:16.211 --> 01:21:20.380
I watched that show on showtime.
Yeah,

1291
01:21:25.211 --> 01:21:29.290

I love this has him.
Oh yes.

1293
01:21:34.061 --> 01:21:38.380

See he got a gym and his girl was hot.
Yeah,

1294
01:21:38.381 --> 01:21:42.250

It was all fun and games.
Someone the fucking pill.

1295
01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:46.750
There was that show and it did show [inaudible] Juggalos too,

Yeah.

1296
01:21:46.751 --> 01:21:50.330

Some fellow Giglio.

1297
01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:54.320

The bald one.
Yeah,

1301

And he's like,
Whoa,

1308
01:22:32.650 --> 01:22:35.160
It goes like that and just scurries off.
Whoa.

1309
01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:38.020

Yes.
Wow.
Interesting.

Would you now,

1314
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:52.540
if you had to hook your lady up with somebody,

1315
01:22:52.541 --> 01:22:55.330
like you're off at war and you're like,
I gotta get you a prostitute.

1316
01:22:55.331 --> 01:22:59.440

Would it be Vin and I'm hiring the cowboys and angels.
Yeah.

I like brain breaks has been on our show.

1325
01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:31.510
Rice was on the show.
Talks like that multiple times.

1326
01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:37.760
This brass ash.
Ash Ash.

She'd be like,
that was really special.

1329
01:23:46.871 --> 01:23:50.230
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now I'm going to go back to Brendan cause he's an animal.

1330
01:23:51.730 --> 01:23:54.220
But brace might give your girl a whole new world.

1331
01:23:56.780 --> 01:23:59.770
It gets fired after every now and that's our official,
fire it up.

1332
01:23:59.890 --> 01:24:02.740
And then you got nick too skinny.
Weird.
I love the rap battles.

1333
01:24:04.570 --> 01:24:08.930
He was so bad.
Oh my God.
Did you,

1334
01:24:09.130 --> 01:24:13.660
how about when they did the Bros when they had to write jokes and it goes down,

1335
01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:14.830
I can do this.

1336
01:24:14.831 --> 01:24:18.640
I don't need to write and just get up there and you never seen it completely

1337
01:24:18.641 --> 01:24:21.520
bombed.
Sparse.
It's great.
And then the guy that goes,

1338
01:24:21.521 --> 01:24:23.040
I've been working on my raps.

1339
01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:28.750
We're huge fans of Nick's videos to be seen as videos like on Youtube.
His music.

1340
01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:31.150
Come on,
you've got to go down the rabbit hole.
Ever done that?

1341
01:24:33.010 --> 01:24:35.980
Why did they stop making it?
I feel like they ran out of material.

1342
01:24:35.981 --> 01:24:39.190
They did like six,
seven seasons.
Why stop there?

1343
01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:43.170
Let's get a new crop of young cats who just dicking girls down.
I don't know.

1344
01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:44.650
Why don't I do an all black one?

1345
01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:50.960
Wouldn't you be into that false.
Some whores mixed up.

1346
01:24:51.010 --> 01:24:55.240
All girls.
I like that girls aren't trying to do it though.
I know the girls,

1347
01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:59.980
it's a bad look for the brace was like,

1348
01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:03.970

just to be clear,

1349
01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:09.340
I'm not some back alley trick and look,

Slang environments and still dine is here.

1357
01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:45.670
What is that song called?
You remember I'm working in a sweat.

1358
01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:50.530
I'm breaking a sweat.

<v 3>from the film.
American justice.</v>

1360
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:07.370
It's not from the film
must be restored.
Shit.

1361
01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:12.170
My mind why you can't blame me for Rick?
You swap in my file.

1362
01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:15.370
I paid a lot more.
I walk a tight.
Wow.

1366
01:26:36.530 --> 01:26:39.220
I don't get one.
Nick doesn't come a Dj like Paris Hilton or herself.

1367
01:26:39.230 --> 01:26:41.400
Like what I'm seeing just pick girls down after the show.

1368
01:26:41.570 --> 01:26:46.430
<v 9>It's a good idea.
Actually.
Deejaying maybe would be better lane,
right?
Yeah.</v>

1369
01:26:46.490 --> 01:26:50.870
Like just put your iTunes podcast playlists on and just trying to see it up

1370
01:26:50.871 --> 01:26:53.920

Making fun of us.
US,</v>

1372
01:26:59.100 --> 01:26:59.933

1375
01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:11.380
He's a

1376
01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:18.190
comic book.
Here's the venom.

1377
01:27:18.191 --> 01:27:22.340
All umbrella theorizing on that.
Oh,
he's super airbrush.

1378
01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:23.923
Star shows up.

1379
01:27:24.290 --> 01:27:29.250

We're breaking,
breaking a sweat.
The name of the song.

1382
01:27:37.250 --> 01:27:39.740
If you listen to a few episodes back,
I don't remember the episode number.

1383
01:27:39.741 --> 01:27:44.630
We can look it up.
I'm sweating and will do for the hot or not like call us.

Seven years.

1386
01:27:51.171 --> 01:27:53.360
I want you to hear you out of here Bro.

1387
01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:13.180

It's just how music is.
Not Forever.</v>

1388

1389
01:28:17.601 --> 01:28:20.330
You know he raps poetry raps.
Yup.

1390
01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:23.110
Fellow tree is that rolls down.

1391
01:28:24.150 --> 01:28:28.270
You realize here's one of those guys that like he can't figure out life,

1392
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:32.290
but it's one of those is how you can figure it out.

1393
01:28:34.230 --> 01:28:35.170
I was going to say

1394
01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:43.200
that is so accurate.
We've been trying to analyze him.
Oh Man.

1395
01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:47.230
Yeah.
I don't know that like you ever tried.
I'll join the swim team.
Fuck it.

1396
01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:51.880
I'll do the swim team
of Joe Rogan,

1397
01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:57.240
like shock Joe does everything and then figures out how to do everything well.

1398
01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:03.590
Right.
And like if he's like his retarded.
Yes.
Evil brothers,
younger brothers,

1399
01:29:03.591 --> 01:29:07.650

I want to try like I do everything too,
but like none of it.

1400
01:29:07.710 --> 01:29:11.990
It's just a complete mess.
It's a mess.
And I love watching masses.
No,

1401
01:29:12.210 --> 01:29:15.930
he just can't figure it out.
Yeah.
You just,

1407
01:29:34.670 --> 01:29:38.550

He's doing confidence coaching and teaches you how to be confident.
Yes,

1408
01:29:38.610 --> 01:29:43.170
that makes sense.
Cause you gotta be a competent motherfucker to fail.

1409
01:29:43.171 --> 01:29:45.540
So many times,
so many avenues.
Just keep going.

1410
01:29:45.870 --> 01:29:47.130

but all I can tell you,

1412
01:29:50.730 --> 01:29:53.670
your boys signed up for it.
They can't be a lot of signups for that.

1413
01:29:55.290 --> 01:29:58.290
If you want it to be better with cooking,

1427
01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:47.790

He's trying to be a fucking Tony Robbins.

1428
01:30:48.630 --> 01:30:51.290
You start to figure life out.

you just figuring it out.

1429
01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:55.270
Fucking who knows if this doesn't work.
I Dunno what happened.

1430
01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:58.170
Why didn't we do it here?
I know,
right?

1431
01:30:58.171 --> 01:31:00.830
Those guys like all look down on it to what's going on here.

1432
01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:05.340
Is She just shoot member?
That was his photo.
All the show.
The shoot.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1433
01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:09.340

Maybe it is.
Yeah.
It's from hustle.

1436
01:31:17.670 --> 01:31:22.380
That is confident.
That's unprofessional.
Yeah.
Right.
Well,

man.
I mean,

1437
01:31:22.381 --> 01:31:26.340
I don't hate,
I really don't hate him.
I respect the hustle.
I just hope he fought.

1438
01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:26.810
You know?

1439
01:31:26.810 --> 01:31:31.260
I hope he hits that home run because he's in a bunch of foul balls right now.

1440
01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:33.540
Like if his life is a baseball game,
he made up,

1441
01:31:33.670 --> 01:31:37.560
oh Joe foul balls to a foul ball.

1442
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:41.850
He is a lot of salt.
You know what?
He just needs Jesus.
He's one of these people.

1443
01:31:41.851 --> 01:31:46.740
I need to do you think so?
Yeah.
He needs a come to Jesus.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's the Lord.

1444
01:31:46.990 --> 01:31:48.040
That could be your kid,

1445
01:31:50.290 --> 01:31:53.520
What up your boy turned into a male.
Whoa.

It was so you do it.

1450
01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:09.610
We were both competitors,

Trying to keep out dog.

1451
01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:11.440

<v 14>Um,
one of those trolls on the Internet.</v>

1458
01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:33.880
Like something,
sometimes I'll get a troll on the Internet and I,

1459
01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:37.360
I won't block or anything.
I DM them and cause I'll go to their page.

1460
01:32:37.370 --> 01:32:40.750
If they're not private,
most trolls are,
I will go to his page and if he has kids,

1461
01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:46.030
I'll just DM them.
Go,

1466
01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:06.880

Yeah.</v>

1470
01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:21.140
Usually I don't even deal with it.
I don't.
You have to up them for me,

1471
01:33:21.141 --> 01:33:25.450
so I don't see it.
So I think everyone loves me.
I'm like,
what lives gray?

1472
01:33:25.470 --> 01:33:29.720
Have someone else watch how my brother will log in for you?
Oh yeah,

1473
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:32.780

And you're like just black people that yeah,

1474
01:33:32.781 --> 01:33:35.580
I'll know like when stuff came out with,

1475
01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:37.610
Nick Diaz or when I was doing the showtime stuff,

1476
01:33:37.611 --> 01:33:41.560
some people might not agree with my opinions and so they'll try to,
you know,

1477
01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:43.100
troll.
So I'm just like,
Yo,

it.

1479
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:48.850
<v 10>That's great.
I'm going to have Tom do that when my Netflix special.</v>

1480
01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:52.930
<v 9>No,
people love it.
Oh fuck.
Is that,</v>

1481
01:33:54.250 --> 01:33:58.260
this is a clip from Christina's openings.
The opening?
Yeah,

1482
01:33:58.820 --> 01:34:03.760
she's talking to me.
Oh my God.
And then I'm like,

1483
01:34:03.850 --> 01:34:07.630
all right babe,
why don't you get on stage?
All right,
well it's fun.
We go.

1484
01:34:07.870 --> 01:34:11.470
Camera's rolling.
What's special is this way.
You can my first one.

1485
01:34:11.710 --> 01:34:15.810
What was your first one?
Yeah.
Well Damn,
congrats.
Thanks dude.
Damn man.
Netflix,

1486
01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:18.130
Netflix.
You're like shit.

1487
01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:20.570
<v 14>Shit dog.
You garbanzo beans,
man.</v>

1488
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:26.150
<v 10>I know.
I can't believe it.
Nervous what?
Uh,
no,</v>

1489
01:34:26.151 --> 01:34:29.480
because I've been fucking doing it for so long.
Honestly,
I was not,

1490
01:34:29.690 --> 01:34:32.810
because I've been doing it for a minute and I,
how long have you been doing it?

1491
01:34:32.811 --> 01:34:36.620
14 years.
So I was like,
I was so on the zone dude.

1492
01:34:36.621 --> 01:34:39.050
I was like lacy go.
Wow.
Yeah,
but it's still,

1493
01:34:39.051 --> 01:34:41.060
it's still like I get it even though for a while,

1494
01:34:41.061 --> 01:34:46.061
but still Netflix now I'm now I'm more nervous to sit down and edit it and get

1495
01:34:46.491 --> 01:34:50.360
that process.
I Dunno,
it's a fucking trip because you just,

1496
01:34:50.361 --> 01:34:53.890
I performed in every shitbox and the country and I,

1497
01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:58.070
oh like you deserve it brown.
It's about

1498
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:59.690
<v 14>the God damn time.</v>

1499
01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:03.870
<v 10>Best Way to do so you know,
like to be like over ready to do it.</v>

1500
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:07.350
I think that's why I wasn't so terrified cause I'm,
I'm kind of am,

1501
01:35:07.351 --> 01:35:10.740
I'm like overcooked for it,
you know,
so I dunno

1502
01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:15.260
<v 14>but switched on Netflix,
like if you shoot a good special on Netflix,</v>

1503
01:35:15.261 --> 01:35:18.230
there's timeout game changer.
Like it make her breaks careers.

1504
01:35:18.231 --> 01:35:20.060
Like there's some guys where whatever,

1505
01:35:20.061 --> 01:35:23.780
they didn't put their best foot forward and then you kind of fucked when you go

1506
01:35:23.781 --> 01:35:26.210
back on the road if it's a bad specialist.
Cause now Netflix,

1507
01:35:26.450 --> 01:35:29.900
if I watched Dave Chapelle,
which is most successful special of all time,

1508
01:35:30.110 --> 01:35:32.900
most watched on if you guys know that.
Yeah,
he watched that and it goes,

1509
01:35:33.050 --> 01:35:37.010
you might also like,
and I watched Tom and yours and it's like,
ah,
what the fuck.

1510
01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:39.350
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
It's just not,

1511
01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:40.880
if you don't put your best foot forward,

1512
01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:44.300
especially these days specials and you guys know better than anyone really fuck

1513
01:35:44.301 --> 01:35:45.790
you.
I'm sure yours is great.

1514
01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:50.090
<v 10>It's great.
It's great.
I agree.
Like I,
I watched some people should,</v>

1515
01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:53.440
I think a lot of times they're shot on Spec and so you don't know who it's going

1516
01:35:53.441 --> 01:35:55.490
to end up.
You don't know where it's going to end up.

1517
01:35:55.491 --> 01:35:58.070
And I do think some people are like whatever.
What do you mean?

1518
01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:00.290
Cause like sometimes when you shoot a special,

1519
01:36:00.291 --> 01:36:04.520
you don't necessarily have a buyer lined up slowly just shoot it on.
Um,
you know,

1520
01:36:04.610 --> 01:36:07.550
at the hopes of selling it.
And so maybe some people are like,
whatever.

1521
01:36:07.551 --> 01:36:11.370
It'll be like on this tiny platform,
no one's gonna see it.
And you know,

1522
01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:15.830
they don't really plan like don't make it that great.
[inaudible] over the plan.

1523
01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:17.220
Hi Mama.
Her hat

1524
01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:22.470
<v 14>plan.
Shit.
I been done planning.
Yeah,
I've been done.
You're ready man.
Alright,</v>

1525
01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:27.140
you ready Tiffany Haddish next couple of weeks over 10.
That is just killing it.

1526
01:36:27.170 --> 01:36:31.820
I love Tiffany.
She's fantastic.
I've never met her.
Oh,
she's the best.
Yeah.
Very,

1527
01:36:31.821 --> 01:36:35.940
very,
very talented.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She's got like some new movie deals.
TV.

1528
01:36:36.030 --> 01:36:39.720
She's killing it.
Killing it.
Just fantastic.
Um,

1529
01:36:39.890 --> 01:36:43.040
I hope everything works out obviously in your life and your marriage,

1530
01:36:43.041 --> 01:36:44.840
but if it doesn't,
maybe

1531
01:36:46.330 --> 01:36:48.850
<v 17>any white,
I'm back with another Rep.
Hello.
Today.</v>

1532
01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:51.720
And by the types of this with you,
you may have worked out the,

1533
01:36:51.730 --> 01:36:55.430
I am going to be doing their guide to getting a gun.
Oh,

1534
01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:57.180
the guy to getting a guy.
Oh,

1535
01:36:57.490 --> 01:37:01.410
the guy to get that guy to guessing it down.

1536
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:05.880
<v 14>Yeah.
There's going to hook you.
Oh God,
man.
You know what I mean?</v>

1537
01:37:05.881 --> 01:37:10.630
It's such a struggle.
Do you feel like he gets laid?
Ah,
yeah.

1538
01:37:11.130 --> 01:37:16.130
This guy go in your and your single days and you're fighting and plus there's

1539
01:37:16.611 --> 01:37:21.611
like a whole groupie like world talk about cage wrath is occasion page.

1540
01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:23.073
So

1541
01:37:25.570 --> 01:37:29.240
what you call Kay k,
they're just there for you guys,

1542
01:37:29.241 --> 01:37:32.360
I assume for you guys.
Oh,
you're fine.
When you're at,

1543
01:37:32.361 --> 01:37:34.220
you're in the UFC and you're fighting,

1544
01:37:35.150 --> 01:37:39.110
I mean everybody knows about NBA and NFL and like,
you know,

1545
01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:41.270
getting off the team playing and all that stuff.

1546
01:37:41.271 --> 01:37:44.420
But like here's the different roles solo.
Yeah,
here's,
but here's the difference.

1547
01:37:44.421 --> 01:37:49.040
So Nba Nfl,
they have NBA,
NFL money.
So again,
different type of hose,
right?

1548
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:53.750
However,
if shit breaks down,
we can beat up any NFL and NBA player.

1549
01:37:53.751 --> 01:37:56.010
So there's that kind tribal,

1550
01:37:56.130 --> 01:38:00.410
<v 9>yeah,
where girls go,
Holy Shit,
there's one Alpha Male,
right?
Give a fighter,</v>

1551
01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:03.810
walks into a party and no matter,
even at the espys,

1552
01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:05.960
if fighter walks in the party,
everyone's like,
okay,

1553
01:38:05.970 --> 01:38:09.160
there's the Alpha genetically,
like going on Youtube.

1554
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:13.050
It curls a little drawn to that.
However,

1555
01:38:13.230 --> 01:38:18.230
now I would say I get more hit on way more and more people slam [inaudible] now

1556
01:38:18.601 --> 01:38:23.310
more so than ever that I've gotten into comedy.
Niven Colin,
what?
Not even close.

1557
01:38:25.470 --> 01:38:29.940
Maybe it's because that might be it,
but also,
um,
may.
Yeah,
maybe.

1558
01:38:30.030 --> 01:38:33.630
Or maybe also,
you know,
one thing people like to do,

1559
01:38:34.650 --> 01:38:38.230
you know,
the common thing is they're like the laugh,
so they know.

1560
01:38:38.970 --> 01:38:43.470
I'll tell you why.
Brandon,
if you look at the pool of Dude's doing stand up here,

1561
01:38:43.471 --> 01:38:47.570
they'll looker of the bunch.
There you go.
Sorry.
Take take.
Take them.

1562
01:38:49.020 --> 01:38:50.760
Hey Man.
I've been doing this shit for 14 years.

1563
01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:54.640
I've been looking at the dudes in the Biz,
aside from my husband who's a Hanson,

1564
01:38:55.410 --> 01:38:59.910
who I married the dime piece.
There's not a lot of eye candy by the way.

1565
01:38:59.911 --> 01:39:04.460
A male comics.
So Brendan's handsome crystal.
Is that,
well,

1566
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:08.610
hey crystal.
It's a little weird,
but he's a dynamo.
Yeah.
Chris,
you know,

1567
01:39:08.611 --> 01:39:10.190
you have a long neck,
but he's a little dynami.

1568
01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:13.650
Got a nice long neck and a lot of Nice long features on Chris.

1569
01:39:13.790 --> 01:39:18.390
Long feature means lean.
You see handsome young man.
Hilarious.

1570
01:39:18.650 --> 01:39:22.650
Yeah.
Nice.
You've seen that dog?
I smelled it.

1571
01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:27.180
Oh Wow.
That was good.
I would say Chris,
most handsome dude and comedy,

1572
01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:31.660
he's definitely,
I mean,
I,
here's the thing.
I would say that there's a,
well,

1573
01:39:31.890 --> 01:39:35.150
we're going to go Tom,
just to,
you know,
I would say there's a,

1574
01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:39.310
or over the years there've been a couple of women than agree with you on Chris

1575
01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:45.840
three at least.
Yeah,
I guess,
cause there's some,

1576
01:39:45.841 --> 01:39:49.710
we are in a business of,
of not good looking guys.

1577
01:39:50.190 --> 01:39:54.330
You guys are talking about dogs,
the dog pound male comics,

1578
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:58.860
dog towns.
I mean it's,
it's the place to succeed for like your,

1579
01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:03.930
the uglier and the worst.
Your attributes.
The WHO,
who was it?

1580
01:40:04.170 --> 01:40:07.530
Erik Griffin.
You know what Eric?
Yeah.
That's great.
I said at the,

1581
01:40:08.130 --> 01:40:11.160
at the Improv and he got in after me and he was like,

1582
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:15.930
I don't know what the fuck that is.
Comics don't look like that.
Looks like this.

1583
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:20.430
He'll lift his shirt up.
Yeah.
He's like,
that ain't comedy.
I was like,
yeah.
Yeah.

1584
01:40:20.431 --> 01:40:25.230
But I mean,
yeah,
I mean comics look like,
you know,
like shit man.
Like Bert,
like,

1585
01:40:25.570 --> 01:40:28.920
like you don't look good.
It looks good.

1586
01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:33.750
I think the tide is turned out because it's cool to work out and that's true.

1587
01:40:34.370 --> 01:40:39.190
Different things.
Who got Red?
He got big.
He got fic right.

1588
01:40:39.290 --> 01:40:42.930
He's clearly on t o t o with,

1589
01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:47.880
I mean TRT testosterone replacement because,
but he don't go from his,

1590
01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:52.120
he was 40 he was so skinny,
so skinny,

1591
01:40:52.940 --> 01:40:55.700
big humps.
That's where it came from.
And then now he's like,
no.

1592
01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:59.440
And Dr Dre got big,
he got like that ain't normal at his age.

1593
01:40:59.441 --> 01:41:03.810
Just get put on 30 pounds of muscle.
Yeah.
But now it's cool to be in shape.

1594
01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:07.900
That's true.
I think people just respect health more than,
you know,

1595
01:41:07.901 --> 01:41:12.220
it's like weird.
Like what much more so than 2030 years ago.
That makes sense.

1596
01:41:12.250 --> 01:41:14.830
You know,
people are always like,
I feel like Kipp top was the first

1597
01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:22.240
real Jackie.
Jackie,
thanks so much.
Steroids.
I bet.

1598
01:41:22.241 --> 01:41:25.210
Like he takes enough.
He might be able to,
you might be able to convince him.

1599
01:41:25.210 --> 01:41:29.650
He could beat you in a fight.
You know,
like,
do you got this shit man,
I'm tired.

1600
01:41:29.770 --> 01:41:31.070
Good chance.
He's crazy.

1601
01:41:31.450 --> 01:41:35.860
I don't want none of that carrot top fucking props and you would have to tape

1602
01:41:35.861 --> 01:41:40.680
the mouth shut cause he will bite the fuck you man.
For sure.
No,

1603
01:41:40.681 --> 01:41:42.850
but I think carrot top you have to,
I mean he looks,

1604
01:41:42.851 --> 01:41:47.110
he looks dirty out of his mind.
So surprise.
You have your teeth.
That's great.

1605
01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:49.630
Do you have all of them or they are original?
They're all mine.

1606
01:41:50.150 --> 01:41:51.490
I'd like a bit of an heiress,
but

1607
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:58.960
those are nice.
Let's go back though.
You don't have to miss it.
I have perfect.

1608
01:41:58.961 --> 01:42:02.300
He's terrible.
Bobby.
The tension.
We see the bottom.
Wait,
wait,

1609
01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:07.480
let me say this first.
Never.
No races.
You're retired or crazy rush.

1610
01:42:07.481 --> 01:42:12.280
Once a day.
Once a day.
Once a week.
What?
Do you know what?

1611
01:42:12.281 --> 01:42:16.960
His teeth are pretty fucking French.
You drink coffee too?
Those are legit teeth.

1612
01:42:16.990 --> 01:42:20.200
Do you floss?
Oh my God.

1613
01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:24.040
You're supposed to got to start flossing.
It's going to change her whole game.

1614
01:42:24.041 --> 01:42:27.510
I'm telling you.
Let's do it.
Talent got Invisalign at 50 that's good.

1615
01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:29.590
He looks great though.
Karen.
Look cal,
it's great.

1616
01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:32.740
This is a little tough

1617
01:42:37.210 --> 01:42:39.720
<v 7>time for it.
Official.</v>

1618
01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:49.490
We have the nerves.
You have stood opposite.
What are you up in the nearest?

1619
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:54.420
Do you still have to do all the regular dental protocol?
Here's the thing.

1620
01:42:54.421 --> 01:42:57.380
Wait,
wait,
wait.
Just to be,
to get

1621
01:42:57.380 --> 01:43:01.790
<v 9>clear for our audience here,
Brendan,
how would you grade his teeth?</v>

1622
01:43:01.850 --> 01:43:05.330
Looking at them?
They look Nice,
right?
Does it very clean.
They're very straight.

1623
01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:10.320
They're very white.
Uh,
your gums look very healthy and not red and bleedy.
Um,

1624
01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:11.630
I think he's doing great.

1625
01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:15.530
So genetically or we use looking at like your teeth or do you have a lot of

1626
01:43:15.590 --> 01:43:19.460
dental work done or no,
zero seven years.

1627
01:43:20.410 --> 01:43:22.580
And my girl's mom is a dentist.

1628
01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:27.360
Holla at your boy because seven years ago,
let me see.
Smile.
Look good.

1629
01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:31.100
But your teeth.
Look Nick,
peep,
peep it.

1630
01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:34.790
I went to a dentist seven years ago that dentist fucked up and goes,

1631
01:43:34.850 --> 01:43:38.600
oh my God was this time.
Saw a dentist.
I went probably 10 years ago,
bitch.

1632
01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:41.900
She goes,
Yo,
you have genetically gifted teeth.

1633
01:43:41.901 --> 01:43:45.320
You some of the best I've ever seen.
I like,
cool.
See you never,

1634
01:43:45.650 --> 01:43:50.040
and your gums are good,
haunted and universal.
Never philosophy ever.
Never.

1635
01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:55.130
I drink,
sold his home every night.
Pulled pork.
No problem.

1636
01:43:55.490 --> 01:43:59.360
Oh,
I drink coffee like a motherfucker.
This is my six cup of coffee a day.

1637
01:43:59.540 --> 01:44:03.710
My shit still kind of white.
Kind of like corn nuts when you do the whitening.

1638
01:44:04.190 --> 01:44:06.740
Never.
Never.
You know why my buddy did it?

1639
01:44:06.890 --> 01:44:11.210
Teeth like got super sensitive and we do it too much and wears off the enamel.

1640
01:44:11.211 --> 01:44:14.900
Yeah,
he's on a jet ski gear booth knocked out all his team.

1641
01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:20.150
Got The ball in half.
How often was he doing it?
A lot.

1642
01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:24.260
That's why you can't you every three years.
Maybe you can do it professionally,

1643
01:44:24.261 --> 01:44:27.470
but don't do those fucking strips,
man.
That's dangerous.

1644
01:44:27.471 --> 01:44:30.390
You could feel them burning.
Of course I did it.

1645
01:44:30.410 --> 01:44:35.410
I just did my teeth whitening about six weeks ago and it was the,

1646
01:44:36.910 --> 01:44:38.960
what's that it heights to actually,

1647
01:44:38.961 --> 01:44:43.961
the funny thing was 24 maybe 30 hours later was more sensitive than immediately

1648
01:44:44.751 --> 01:44:46.370
leaving there,
but you can't drink coffee.
Right?

1649
01:44:46.610 --> 01:44:49.850
I didn't drink coffee around all day.
No.
For a day I can't do that.
I'm out.

1650
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.670
I tried to Wean off God for a day.
I should swear to God.

1651
01:44:53.060 --> 01:44:56.020
Cold sweats in the fetal position on the ground sweat.

1652
01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:57.980
How much are you drinking a day?
Six.

1653
01:44:57.981 --> 01:45:02.981
Seven carboy hydrating enough water colors.

1654
01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:07.120
Your p Eau Claire.
Yeah.
So you really balance out your coffee.

1655
01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:10.400
I drink fluids and non stop and your teeth look great.
Thanks man.

1656
01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:13.940
I still want veneers.
You want to do,
you should say,
what about the,

1657
01:45:14.090 --> 01:45:16.700
that water pick you were thinking about using that or anything?

1658
01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:18.850
I don't feel like there's any meat to,
well yeah,

1659
01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:22.120
she said you're like genetically gifted.
So when she told me that was the same,

1660
01:45:22.780 --> 01:45:27.080
I'll have great teeth.
Uh,
mom pops,
my mom's little yellow.

1661
01:45:27.081 --> 01:45:30.370
Not going to lie my mom's teeth or your moms.
What?
60 something?

1662
01:45:30.380 --> 01:45:34.940
My mom's teeth look like corn nuts.
Yeah.
That's terrible.
I know dad is older.

1663
01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:37.700
My that's straight.
My brother had braces for about eight years.

1664
01:45:37.701 --> 01:45:41.810
She brought an athlete to know computer guy,
computer engineer,
smart.

1665
01:45:42.530 --> 01:45:46.040
I would suggest where eventually you're going to,
how old are you now?

1666
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:50.800
34 yet to start flossing.
Just for your health,
for your second son.

1667
01:45:50.930 --> 01:45:55.160
Try it.
You just to try it.
Once you start,
it's very hard to,
to not do it.

1668
01:45:55.950 --> 01:45:58.820
It does feel good.
When did you start doing it?
Feels so much better.

1669
01:45:58.850 --> 01:46:03.380
What if I got veneers and stuff?
They'll flog.
Yes.
Yes,
yes,
yes,

1670
01:46:03.410 --> 01:46:08.180
yes.
It doesn't,
it doesn't exempt you from hygiene.
Isn't it?
Like,
uh,
like uh,

1671
01:46:08.420 --> 01:46:11.940
basically like a windshield on your car.
It's terrible.
No,

1672
01:46:12.170 --> 01:46:14.780
it's painful and it takes a long time.
I'm not going to lie.

1673
01:46:14.810 --> 01:46:16.710
They shaved down your real teeth.
They,

1674
01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:21.290
then they cover it with the fake teeth of veneer.
It's a very,

1675
01:46:21.970 --> 01:46:26.030
it's an ordeal.
Don't do it unless I had to because I knocked out half a one.

1676
01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:30.680
What's a kit now?
I was on the rings.
That was the,
Oh,

1677
01:46:30.681 --> 01:46:34.400
so you've had veneers for Greg?
My whole life I've had to get fake teeth.
Oh.

1678
01:46:34.470 --> 01:46:38.000
Cause I knocked out half of this one as a kid.
It's like a playground accident.

1679
01:46:38.090 --> 01:46:42.360
Nothing really.
I'm not that tough guys.
Uh,
we got an email cause too much work.

1680
01:46:42.770 --> 01:46:47.750
So much work.
So it's like a grand a tooth to right,
but it's your teeth.

1681
01:46:48.110 --> 01:46:49.770
We just spend the money here.
Here's you go.

1682
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:54.780
You guys are all about teeth health for calm my
teeth police.

1683
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:58.320
This is,
yeah,
you don't take care of your teeth.
You're Outta here man.

1684
01:46:58.530 --> 01:47:03.300
Detectives take polices out here Bro.
You got yellow teeth.
You out.
Oh God.

1685
01:47:03.301 --> 01:47:03.751
Your Mommy's.

1686
01:47:03.751 --> 01:47:07.140
I love the podcast and have a quick question for you to ponder upon.

1687
01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:10.620
Since every other body fluid has it.
Diff,
definite smell.

1688
01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:13.440
Do boogers and snot have a set as well?
Yes.

1689
01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:17.100
Have we become so accustomed to this set that our brains just ignores it?
Yes.

1690
01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:21.030
Mommy jeans.
Horrible sneezed.
Maybe wonder about this,
keeping it high and tight.

1691
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:25.110
Loose Soup and dad.
Boners Dan.
Um,
yeah,
I mean I think,

1692
01:47:25.170 --> 01:47:28.560
do you ever take one out and then smell it?
No.
Does that discussing now,

1693
01:47:28.561 --> 01:47:32.430
but I know I smell like my kids breath when he's got a cold and you know that

1694
01:47:32.431 --> 01:47:35.520
that's the smell of snob.
Yeah.
It's not smell does not smell.
Yeah.

1695
01:47:35.610 --> 01:47:37.490
I think there's definite smells,
everything,

1696
01:47:37.530 --> 01:47:40.230
but everything that's in your nose is not going to smell to you,
obviously,

1697
01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:43.230
because you can get brain gets used to it so that you can function.
Yeah.

1698
01:47:43.231 --> 01:47:47.670
Otherwise you'd be just completely distracted by that smell.
Like,
like La,

1699
01:47:47.671 --> 01:47:51.000
if you leave la for awhile,
they come back,
smells funky.

1700
01:47:51.250 --> 01:47:53.050
But to us this is normal.
I like,

1701
01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:58.430
<v 3>I don't like this.
I don't like this.
Whatever you're playing</v>

1702
01:48:01.890 --> 01:48:03.730
<v 9>boredom.
I Dunno.
Horse.
Somebody said it.</v>

1703
01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:08.350
<v 3>Oh.
Oh.
Oh.</v>

1704
01:48:08.810 --> 01:48:13.670
Someone's going
or

1705
01:48:13.670 --> 01:48:17.520
<v 9>someone's getting murdered.
No video or porno.
It's messy.</v>

1706
01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:18.860
That's Christina Sneeze on the show.

1707
01:48:23.170 --> 01:48:25.670
Get upset.
A lot of people.

1708
01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:30.620
All right.
We gotta get going on.
This was a lot of fun.

1709
01:48:30.621 --> 01:48:33.820
Thanks for coming on the show.
Yeah.
Thank you guys.
So keeping your camera,

1710
01:48:34.190 --> 01:48:38.000

but then break your fucking arm when I get out of this.
No,
no,
please.

1711
01:48:38.001 --> 01:48:42.070
God.
No Man.
Anything but my arm.
Um,
anything.
Wait,

1712
01:48:42.150 --> 01:48:46.940
a working people see you,
Brendan,
just so they know I'm in.
And thank you Justin.

1713
01:48:46.941 --> 01:48:50.710
Ed Brooke.
I'm in San Francisco the same night you're in Oakland.
Oh,

1714
01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:55.320
town Thursday.
This Thursday.
I'm in San Francisco cobb's.

1715
01:48:55.830 --> 01:48:57.290
He's like 20 tickets left.

1716
01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:01.940
He brought jd.com for tickets and then the following Friday I'm at the laugh

1717
01:49:01.941 --> 01:49:03.740
factory in Long Beach.
Oh,
that's great.

1718
01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:07.910
[inaudible] k.com he's got very popular podcasts.
More than one.

1719
01:49:07.911 --> 01:49:11.620
He's got the fire of the kid with very long and thick.
Dick Bryan Cannon.

1720
01:49:11.630 --> 01:49:16.460
We learned it.
We've had on this show and then he also has a big brown breakdown.

1721
01:49:16.910 --> 01:49:21.550
Was that,
that's all fight stuff,
I'm assuming.
Nah,
y'all fight boxing.
All right.

1722
01:49:22.490 --> 01:49:25.370
What's going to happen?
Wait isn't a triple g Kanellis again.

1723
01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:29.320
What do you think's gonna Happen?
I think it's going to be a good fights.

1724
01:49:29.330 --> 01:49:31.580
I need to be the fight of the age is like,
people think,

1725
01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:35.000
I think the big knock for,
I mean that I've heard from a lot of people,

1726
01:49:35.001 --> 01:49:38.300
I've watched both those guys fight a good number of times is that people have

1727
01:49:38.301 --> 01:49:43.130
not triple g's competition.
They're like,
he's got correct hammer hands.
Correct.

1728
01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:46.060
But it's like a bunch of bumps.
It's like,
you know,
I won't say bummed.

1729
01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:48.250
I met Danny is a tough customer

1730
01:49:48.250 --> 01:49:51.490
<v 14>and you know,
some people thought he'd beat him,
but in Danny Jacobs,
bigger guy.</v>

1731
01:49:51.491 --> 01:49:54.400
But um,
again,
I,
I think it's,
we are really good fight.

1732
01:49:54.580 --> 01:49:55.950
I think Canelo winds in decision,

1733
01:49:55.951 --> 01:49:58.930
but I think most of the public things triple g wins the fight.

1734
01:49:59.110 --> 01:50:02.380
Then you see him in a rematch and the rematch will be the barn burner.
Okay.

1735
01:50:02.410 --> 01:50:05.560
But it,
it's a great five best fire.
Right?
Ah,
man,
I can't,

1736
01:50:05.770 --> 01:50:08.220
last time we had this ghetto fight.
It's been a long time.
Yeah,

1737
01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:10.030
he really does throw some fucking,

1738
01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:15.070
