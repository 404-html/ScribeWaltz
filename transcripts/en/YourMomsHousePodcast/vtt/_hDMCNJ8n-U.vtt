00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.210
Or just hire a PA or a little person.

21
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.870
There you go.

That's really gross.</v>

77
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.940
I wanted to play this clip today,

the fucking files were all fucked up.

78
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.770

<v 4>all morning.
It has bothered me and bothered me.</v>

81
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.940
It is eight at me and I'm just,
I'm still upset like as a mom,

82
00:05:40.941 --> 00:05:45.050
I'm just mad.
I am mad man of the,
and,

83
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.210
and I'm going to give it a second.
I have an 11 year old daughter,

84
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.840
Aaliyah.
She loves that one.

85
00:05:53.841 --> 00:05:58.520
Oh 4.5 radio station she loves and like whatever,

86
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.710
like I like the top hits.
Right?

87
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.710
I remember listening to the top hits when I was a kid,

88
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.250
like Britney spears and Christina Aguilera and backstreet boys and then seek,

89
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:13.820
and those were the top hits when I was just played,

90
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.390
which is fine.
I don't mind that.
Okay.
Um,

91
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.060
I usually listen to like the effect,

92
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.270
it's all Toby Mac newsboys is Christian music.

93
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.810
<v 3>Oh No.
We'll get to it here in a second.
Oh No,</v>

94
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.530

Bring it in one month into this</v>

95
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.100
role.
Go

96
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.573
Christina.

97
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.833
<v 5>Okay.</v>

98
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.570
<v 3>This audio,</v>

99
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.730
<v 6>it looks like it's on two channels,
right?</v>

100
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.800
And No.
Oh,
I see what's going on.

101
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.310
Hold on,
hold on,
hold on,
hold on.

102
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.860
<v 3>It looks like because this isn't here,</v>

103
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:47.040
<v 6>that's only playing in one,
but the rest of them are playing in too.</v>

104
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.290
<v 3>You understand what I'm saying?
No I don't,</v>

105
00:07:49.291 --> 00:07:51.710
but as long as you understand that's all that matters.
Can you hold,

106
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:55.900
can you correct it?
Yeah.
I want to say ms up for one second.
Yeah.
All right.
Um,

107
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.110
let's see if this works on both.

108
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:03.430
<v 6>Oh No,
you did.
Yeah.</v>

109
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:11.150
<v 3>Oh,
that's loud.
That was really,
yeah.
So the,
um,
no ma'am,</v>

110
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.570
ma'am.
Ma'Am,
ma'am,
ma'am.

111
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:18.720
Coffee tastes like a dirty ash tray.
It tastes like cigarettes.

112
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.530
Why do you have cigarette flavored coffee that you've purchased the coffee that

113
00:08:22.531 --> 00:08:24.990
you can't live without?
It tastes like shit.

114
00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.350
You didn't put any sweetener in it cause you're on your fucking weird diet,

115
00:08:28.351 --> 00:08:33.090
right?
Yeah.
It tastes like assholes.
I don't know how you're drinking it.
Okay.

116
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.490
Oh,
it smells like a dirty ash tray.

117
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:42.410
<v 6>Oh,
oh.
Oh,
okay.</v>

118
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.890
<v 3>When I used to smoke,
that's why I can do that.</v>

119
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.600
<v 6>Yeah.
You like that?
I like it.
Uh Huh.</v>

120
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:53.650
<v 3>I don't drink coffee for flavor anymore.
No,
you don't.
No.
Just for torture,</v>

121
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.070
for bowel torture as you know what you don't want to get again,

122
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.330
<v 6>that Australian coffee,
Australian dream.
I know that Australian dream.</v>

123
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.030
I want to go.
I want to order that again.

124
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.820
When you're talking about that shit was buttery and delicious,

125
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:09.840
and then to get that again,
my order it today show.
Okay,
we'll give a fuck.

126
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:14.900
I'll sit and I'm going to make it in that attack.
Like the stove press.
Yeah.
No,

127
00:09:14.901 --> 00:09:17.490
that's not,
what's it called?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Not the press.
No.

128
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.670
It's good value and style.
It's like the one my mom used to.
Yeah,

129
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:25.510
the rocket rocket fuel.
Yeah,
that was,
that's good.
That makes you shit a lot.
Yeah,

130
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:29.470
yeah,
yeah.
I'm so fucking dumb.
Okay.

131
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.810
I'm just making sure this is working,
right.
So are we.
So just so people know,

132
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.310
the reason that this is fucked up,

133
00:09:34.311 --> 00:09:38.750
like where that opening clip was fucked up is normally we play these at a clips,

134
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.950
but the clips were like corrupted.
They were all fucked up.
They're all fucked up.

135
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.080
Not all of them,
just this Bank of clips.

136
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.720
So I have to play it from the source file,

137
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:52.550
which is basically play and pause and scrolling.
And that's why it sucks.

138
00:09:52.551 --> 00:09:57.551
But this lady made this video that we played the first like 50 seconds of Ravi c

139
00:09:59.091 --> 00:09:59.751
she's talking about,

140
00:09:59.751 --> 00:10:03.440
she's driving her daughter to school or 11 year old daughter and her daughter

141
00:10:03.441 --> 00:10:07.790
likes a certain radio station where they play today's hits.
And she's saying,

142
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.820
you know,
when I was a kid I liked that too.
I listened to my,
the hits,

143
00:10:10.821 --> 00:10:14.180
then Britney Spears and in sync and all that,
whatever.
Right?

144
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.990
So now she's going on about,
um,

145
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.220
about what she's upset about.
Okay,
let's hear it.

146
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:26.560
<v 4>That's what I usually have it on.
And my car.
Um,</v>

147
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.920
I had just dropped Gabby off and,

148
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.240
and guys,

149
00:10:33.241 --> 00:10:36.030
I could not believe what I was hearing.

150
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.510
Like this is on our,

151
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.700
our written local radio station.
This crap is being played.

152
00:10:44.701 --> 00:10:48.420
I couldn't even believe the words that I was listening to.

153
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.680
I love how upset she was.
And as a mom,
as a mom,

154
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.370
it's my thing me like why is this on here?
Oh,

155
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:59.303
I'm sorry.

156
00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.160
I'm going to collect myself because this is,

157
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.740
this is what our youth is being subjected to,
subjected to.

158
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.180
I agree.
So I feel when I hear top four and I'm going to read it to you dog shit,

159
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:19.650
and I want you do you thirsty?
Please grab a sprite.

160
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.520
My crips Lurkin don't die tonight.

161
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:28.830
I just want to dance with you baby.
Just don't move too fast.

162
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.290
I'm too crazy man.

163
00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:35.130
Down down the AV and get shaded.

164
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:39.410
Take a Nigga mind off that big word we can get.

165
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:45.230
Fuck in the whip slide right back in the function.

166
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.990
One wrong word.
Start busting.

167
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:54.100
Put that on my Yankee hat.
Fritz Bandana Brown

168
00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:56.510
<v 3>guys.
I need some.
I've,</v>

169
00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:00.440
I've felt this way since I was 12 when I heard top 40 music.
I was like,

170
00:12:00.441 --> 00:12:03.160
this is the dumbest shit.
It's a little different.
I think it was going on here.

171
00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:06.650
I've ever heard.
Well,
she's upset because she thinks the lyrics are offensive,

172
00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:10.950
but Brittany Spears was saying,
you know,
I just want to fuck you and hip.

173
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:15.220
She was pretending to be a teenage fuck queen.
Yeah,
right.
She was driving,

174
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:20.150
I just want to fuck you.
And that's all her songs.
Like,
well,
I was like,

175
00:12:20.151 --> 00:12:23.830
hit me baby.
It's,
it's all about being an underaged fuck him.

176
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.890
That was her whole persona.
And that doesn't offend you.
Yeah.

177
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:34.300
Yeah.
Finger my privacy.

178
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:39.260
Yeah.
All those songs are about finger grabbed my pussy.
Basically.

179
00:12:39.261 --> 00:12:43.720
It's Donald Trump.
Yeah.

180
00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.080
Everyone fuck this whole,
and she's not bummed about that.

181
00:12:48.081 --> 00:12:49.130
And like that was okay for her.

182
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.960
She should just make her kids listen to Christian music.

183
00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:59.660
<v 4>Like the dope daddy shooting in the kitchen.
Real nurse side.</v>

184
00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:04.670
Nigga never went to Paulie Wilson work or Barilla cocaine color of a

185
00:13:05.691 --> 00:13:07.910
[inaudible].
I don't even know if I pronounced that right.

186
00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:11.300
T scrap moving for the Da da,

187
00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:16.340
but they shoot an every day round my mama and them way.

188
00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.560
So we put a k

189
00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:22.330
<v 3>is it totally necessary to read every like couldn't you just paraphrase it a</v>

190
00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:27.120
couple of her?
Well I can't wait for someone to put this to a song.

191
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.590
They did
decided.
Okay,

192
00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.560
well they also like the flow is incredibly,
they chopped it up so that it flows

193
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:39.590
<v 4>and how to stay and that's for any Nigga say he got a problem with me now I'm</v>

194
00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.880
cribbing where I'm living.
Come and follow me.

195
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:45.983
<v 3>Y'All</v>

196
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:53.700
pull out the actual
actual,
you know,

197
00:13:53.701 --> 00:13:58.701
I was forced to listen to top 40 music on my drive to the Dallas airport and I

198
00:13:59.791 --> 00:14:04.020
actually disagree with her.
Finish my thoughts.
Yeah.

199
00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:09.810
I actually think that top 40 music has become deeper then when I was a kid

200
00:14:09.811 --> 00:14:13.560
because I was listening to the lyrics and they weren't as dumb as they used to

201
00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:18.080
be.
It used to just be like,
tonight,
it's gonna be a good night tonight.

202
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:22.230
Tonight it's going to be fun.
Let's wet are pussies.

203
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:23.700
And finger are buttholes

204
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:30.120
and now it's like they had to talk about feelings.
They talk about sadness,

205
00:14:30.121 --> 00:14:30.361
you know,

206
00:14:30.361 --> 00:14:34.860
there's a little more nuance to top 40 I discovered this when I was forced to

207
00:14:34.861 --> 00:14:39.630
listen to it in a car ride,
but I haven't heard,

208
00:14:39.631 --> 00:14:42.590
by the way,
the Trump audio,
now that you're saying,

209
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.160
have you really,
I haven't heard it.
I thought I did.

210
00:14:47.161 --> 00:14:51.800
I thought I had on the internet or he's,

211
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:55.100
he's inside of a bus with that Billy goat.
Okay.
Only heard bleeps.

212
00:14:55.101 --> 00:14:58.310
You've heard it.
Oh yeah,
no,
I've heard it for real.
He's like,
I just,

213
00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:02.910
I grabbed their pussies and I just take it.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

214
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:06.740
You've been missing out.
It's really good.
Yeah.
You know,

215
00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:11.490
and the best part is you're going to do what you want.
I grab women by the Pussy.

216
00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:16.370
Yeah.
You just,
you just grab him by the opposing
dub.

217
00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:20.690
That bitch go.
Let's see here.

218
00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:25.790
Maybe gravel,
Blah there.
Plus.
Okay.
This one says it has graphic language.

219
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.950
<v 7>Oh,
it's so great.
She's still,
I moved on her actually,
you know,</v>

220
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:33.120
she was down in Palm Beach.
I moved on her NFL.
I'll admit it.

221
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:36.520
I did try and fuck her.
She was married to Sarah.

222
00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.890
I know Nancy and I moved on her very heavily.
In fact,

223
00:15:40.891 --> 00:15:44.490
I took her out furniture shopping.
She wanted to get some furniture.
I said,

224
00:15:44.491 --> 00:15:47.250
I'll show you where they have some nice furniture.
I took her out furniture,

225
00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:52.860
bitch.
I couldn't get there and she was married.
Then all of a sudden I see her.

226
00:15:52.861 --> 00:15:54.690
She's now got the big phony tents and everything.

227
00:15:54.691 --> 00:15:58.500
She's totally changed her looks.
She's your girl's hot as shit in the purple.

228
00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:00.990
<v 8>Hello?
Hello.</v>

229
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:08.270
Hey,
wait.
You got to look at it when you get to have this up.

230
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:18.380
<v 7>Oh,
that's pretty much.
It gets better.
It does stay with you and I will walk down.</v>

231
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:25.900
I'm glad they publish it.

232
00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:29.280
There's another one that's supposed to be one more piece on NBC.
Yeah,

233
00:16:29.281 --> 00:16:33.800
that's a new one.
Just in case.
Just start kissing her

234
00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.180
automatically attracted to beautiful.
I just started kissing them

235
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:44.600
and when you're a star,
they let you do it.
You can do anything.
Whatever you want,

236
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:45.700
grab them by the Pussy.

237
00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.700
<v 3>Ladies and gentlemen,
the future president of the United States.</v>

238
00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:55.660
I haven't heard it like that.
It's so much different to hear that then.
Um,

239
00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.700
yeah,
it's better.
Yeah.
I hate censored clips.

240
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.920
It takes the gravity out of it.
When you hear a Douche bag being a douche bag,

241
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:06.210
it's so much better grab them by the Pussy.

242
00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:13.220
Like you have to be a real savage to use that phrase.
Right.

243
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:17.130
Because I mean you guys do locker room talk.
I'm sure you and your in your bros.

244
00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:18.450
When you guys broke down,

245
00:17:18.451 --> 00:17:23.100
do you guys say things like you can just grab her by her pussy fucking grabbed

246
00:17:23.101 --> 00:17:23.934
by the pussy?

247
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.690
No,
I would say cause I've heard a lot,
there's weird on on,

248
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.990
on Twitter there's a lot of like,
yeah,
that's how people,

249
00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.490
I heard people saying like that's how people talk.
Like no,
not people.
Here's,

250
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.100
here's guy talk for guys I would

251
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.880
<v 6>say is like,
well look at her tits.
Look like if you're,</v>

252
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:56.940
if you're being crude it's usually like look at her,
right?

253
00:17:56.941 --> 00:18:00.180
Like yeah look at that ass.
Yeah,
she's fucking hot,
you know.

254
00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:02.730
But like that it's not usually like,
yeah,

255
00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:05.170
you know what I do is I always go there and I grabbed their pussies.

256
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.470
That's crazy.
People would be like,
what?

257
00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:12.900
<v 3>What are you talking about?
It's a stranger.
It is a kind of a weirder idea.</v>

258
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:16.820
That'd be like me,
me,
like I just,
I just grab him by the Cox.
Yeah.
Like wait,
what?

259
00:18:16.821 --> 00:18:20.310
That's such a vulgar.
It's too much.
It's too,
it's almost,

260
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:25.100
it is kind of a violent idea.
Yeah.
It's aggressive.
It's weird,

261
00:18:25.101 --> 00:18:27.260
man.
Yeah.
I,
it's really a bummer.

262
00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:32.120
So apparently there's even more that NBC is withholding.

263
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:33.630
They're not,
oh,
releasing.

264
00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:38.250
There's even more of him saying crazy stuff and there's petitions.
I just,

265
00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:40.590
I just signed one to have it released to,

266
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:44.030
to pressure NBC to release him being even creepier.

267
00:18:44.031 --> 00:18:48.760
Cause I really get a kick out of these.
I think they're super fun.
Super Funny.

268
00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:51.440
They suspended Billy Bush.
I'm just seeing this right now.
Oh,

269
00:18:51.441 --> 00:18:53.000
his career is over too,
right?

270
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:58.200
<v 6>It's over.
Um,
well he's participating with the,
so it says,</v>

271
00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:02.820
uh,
uh,
Bush released an apology.

272
00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:07.710
Gamin you know,
he was sitting there.
Yeah.
Basically being the sidekick,

273
00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:11.640
which is just embarrassing because I think every guy at least has played that

274
00:19:11.641 --> 00:19:13.830
role usually into,

275
00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.610
in the scenario where you're hanging out with the more of an Alpha male.
Right.

276
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:21.300
So you're,
the Alpha male is saying stuff and you're like,
yeah,
fuck her.
Yeah,

277
00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:25.140
yeah,
yeah.
And it's just,
I think everybody,
I know myself,

278
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:29.190
I've played that role,
you know,
it kind of,
it happens naturally,

279
00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:34.410
but to have it played back for you has to be just so he wanted it.
Oh yeah,
yeah,

280
00:19:34.411 --> 00:19:37.730
yeah.
I mean to be like,
you're the man man.
Like yeah.

281
00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:40.200
Stick lucky that like Michael Jordan,
you're so cool.

282
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:42.730
Like that's basically what he was doing there.

283
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:44.423
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

284
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:49.120
Because what's he supposed to say is as Billy Bush supposed to be like,

285
00:19:49.121 --> 00:19:52.330
you know what sir,
I don't think we should degrade women.
Yeah.

286
00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:56.650
I Dunno what I mean.
It's,
I don't think that's appropriate.
Dot.

287
00:19:56.651 --> 00:19:59.590
I don't know what they were at and wanting to dump the don,

288
00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:03.760
he was definitely like cheerleading and uh,
you know,
he was doing the,

289
00:20:03.761 --> 00:20:08.680
yeah.
Yeah.
Actually locker room talk is kind of what he did.
Like,
whoa.
Yeah,

290
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:12.460
look here.
She's hot.
They're saying it about some girl that's off camera there.

291
00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:16.210
Right?
Like that's kind of,
yeah,
that's normal.

292
00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.160
That's a normal locker.
So that's,
I mean that's,

293
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:23.210
I've heard guys say that a million times.
Yeah.
She's fucking hot.
Yeah.

294
00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:24.240
Which is fine.
But the,

295
00:20:24.241 --> 00:20:28.150
the best part is that hot chick comes to greet them as part of like the show.

296
00:20:28.151 --> 00:20:32.160
I guess they're taping the apprentice.
Yeah.
And you see them.
It's Kinda,

297
00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:35.080
it's kind of grody cause he's saying all that stuff.
And then,

298
00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.040
and then him and Billy are like a what?
A,
why don't you give him a kiss?
Yeah.

299
00:20:39.041 --> 00:20:42.640
Hug Him,
give him a hug,
give him a kiss.
Like they've just proved out on her.
Yeah.

300
00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:46.120
And then they're kind of manipulating her and she's on camera,
so she's like,

301
00:20:46.121 --> 00:20:49.210
uh Huh.
Okay.
Oh,
you're both Hanson.
You know,

302
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.300
it's kind of a Douchey,
douchey thing to force that on somebody.

303
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:58.410
No,
not really.
Are you?
Sorry,
I don't know.

304
00:20:58.411 --> 00:21:03.190
I've never been the type that I guess goes for it like that.

305
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.570
The O two with checks like that on your style.

306
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.160
My style was always like,

307
00:21:09.161 --> 00:21:13.000
if affection comes to me then you know what I mean?

308
00:21:13.001 --> 00:21:16.740
Like you mean like a normal human being?

309
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.880
Someone shows interest,
you go for it.
Yeah.
Kind of like our,
I was never like

310
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:27.840
right.
Like a predator.
Yeah.
Yeah.

311
00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:31.990
Well there are guys that are just sharks,
right?
They just go for it.
Yeah,
sure.

312
00:21:31.991 --> 00:21:32.201
I mean,

313
00:21:32.201 --> 00:21:37.030
I know so gross throughout life I've met guys whose whose style,

314
00:21:37.031 --> 00:21:38.110
which just crazy,

315
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.770
but I can smell those douchebags and a mile away cause it's a thousand

316
00:21:41.771 --> 00:21:46.250
compliments.
Right.
And then God,
girl,
Girl,
you got me,
girl,
you so key.

317
00:21:46.251 --> 00:21:50.380
You got me going from across the boom girl.
Oh really?

318
00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:54.270
How are you doing better now that I'm talking to you,
you're like,
oh my God.

319
00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.850
Right.
So obvious.
Better.
Now that I'm talking to you,

320
00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:03.760
it's usually,
you know,
the brothers would step to me really in the clubs.
Yeah.

321
00:22:03.761 --> 00:22:06.970
Well,
this is what I'm in my twenties and early,
you know,
late teens,

322
00:22:06.971 --> 00:22:11.290
twenties in the,
I now have been in nightclubs since I was 20.
Yeah,
26

323
00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:22.600
what's crazy is he was 59 when he was talking like it was a younger immature
man.

324
00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.210
That's what they were critiquing the uh,
Billy Bush fork is his,

325
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:30.880
his apology was saying I was younger and immature and he was 34,

326
00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:37.090
not 19.
Yeah.
19 year old saying this stuff and I'd be like,

327
00:22:37.091 --> 00:22:40.540
well dude,
they're retarded.
He'll learn.
Let's see.

328
00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:44.170
Do you want to hear this ladies?
If they cut it up,
the remix.
Oh,
I love to,
yeah,

329
00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.800
it's good.
It's good.

330
00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:51.820
Then in the background Skyler's how boy Skyler,

331
00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:58.390
that's officially over right.
Skylar.
Are we done with that name?
Uh,
yeah,

332
00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:03.370
I think so.
It's tough.
Tough name.

333
00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:07.900
See if there's any more.
I thought there was a couple other remixes.
Let's see.

334
00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:14.680
The best is like making a video like she made and not realizing that people are

335
00:23:14.681 --> 00:23:15.514
like,
yeah.

336
00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:21.150
And then turn it into a hundred remixes of her crying and I liked this rap

337
00:23:21.671 --> 00:23:24.910
music.
I could get into rap if it was like,
this is Vince staples,
man.

338
00:23:24.911 --> 00:23:29.620
It's hilarious what she was doing.
Yeah.
Because of Niggas like me or she goes,

339
00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:34.960
you know what I find really funny is when people are offended and then they go

340
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:38.120
and as a mom,
as if the,

341
00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:42.190
those things have never existed in society and you have absolutely zero

342
00:23:42.191 --> 00:23:46.640
responsibility to tell your kids like,
hey,
is entertainment.
You know,

343
00:23:46.641 --> 00:23:51.530
like the thing of the children can't dare you.
Like wow,

344
00:23:51.531 --> 00:23:55.610
your kid,
you know,
I think this is for people older than you.

345
00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.900
It's not for you,
for you,
because of what?

346
00:23:57.901 --> 00:24:00.120
A few years you'll be fucking and then you can listen to them.

347
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:04.210
Then you can fuck your boyfriend.
Tell all this cool music.
Yeah.
You know?

348
00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:08.130
You know,
she was always nice to me.
She never called me a Nigga.
Oh for fuck.

349
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:09.403
<v 9>Okay.</v>

350
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:17.470
<v 3>Set me up cigarette.
He set me up.
It was pretty good.</v>

351
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:22.080
Hey,
guess what I'm doing today?
What I'm going on?
Not just [inaudible] NATO.

352
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.230
If you guys know he gone day,
I don't know when it will air.

353
00:24:26.231 --> 00:24:30.160
So it might be airing today.
I don't know how it,
how the,
how it's structured.

354
00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.950
Yeah.
I assume it might air today,
which is going to be too late,

355
00:24:32.951 --> 00:24:35.620
but I'm sure it'll live on mine.
I'm doing,
uh,

356
00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:38.590
not just competitor Nieto is so exciting.
It's,

357
00:24:38.591 --> 00:24:42.020
that means you're going to be interviewed by a clown today.
Yeah.

358
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:44.750
And it's in Spanish,
right?
Yeah.
This is a,

359
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:48.860
so are you going to speak Spanish or how are we going to do this guy's Arad?

360
00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:53.910
No,
just go and plant a neat though.
The night of plantings.
No,
it's,

361
00:24:53.911 --> 00:24:57.370
it's like evenings with,
but the Nico,
that guy,
oh right there.

362
00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:02.040
[inaudible] Nieto and he's like,
oh,
I'm so sneaky.
I am a clown,
but oh,

363
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:07.400
so do you get paid and Tacos to do this day?
But God,
you're terrible.
Oh,

364
00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:09.790
plantings.
No,
no.
That's his name.

365
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:16.063
<v 5>I love it.</v>

366
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:30.633
<v 10>No worries.</v>

367
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.590
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

368
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:39.050
<v 10>Got It.
I got it.</v>

369
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:43.790
<v 3>I can't wait.
Exert,
so I'm the,</v>

370
00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:48.020
I'm the lead guest and I get to do an interview and I get to play two games.

371
00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.160
What are your,
do you know your games?
Yeah.
Can you tell me or,

372
00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:55.090
I don't want to spoil it,
but I think Daca Lewis internal,

373
00:25:55.091 --> 00:26:00.091
I think you see somebody has on a body suit with basically items hidden in them.

374
00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:05.330
And I'm supposed to touch with a blind folded and then we're doing dominoes one,

375
00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.780
not the game dominoes,
but with Domino's sticks,
you know,

376
00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:13.610
like just actual dominoes set up.
Yep.
Yep.
And they fall over and then if I get,

377
00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:18.500
if they get something wrong,
they pour cold water down my pants.
No,
really,

378
00:26:18.501 --> 00:26:21.440
you have to bring a change of clothes.
That's awesome.
Yeah.
Oh my God,

379
00:26:21.441 --> 00:26:24.830
we have to see this.
Yeah.
And see this I,
it will be online with you today.

380
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.030
It'll be online,
man.

381
00:26:26.031 --> 00:26:29.130
I'm so jealous because he could put in a good word for me in plants.

382
00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.270
Anytime you want to be on a kind of,
yeah,
yeah.

383
00:26:32.271 --> 00:26:35.420
I'm sure this is like the only show worth doing.
Fuck the tonight show.

384
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:38.960
[inaudible] this is where it's at.
Yup.
This is it,
man.

385
00:26:38.961 --> 00:26:40.790
I haven't seen you this excited by the way.

386
00:26:40.791 --> 00:26:43.440
Like you've done Conan and you're like,
yeah,

387
00:26:43.441 --> 00:26:47.370
I'm doing Conan tonight and then this one you've been,
you got your hair done.

388
00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.450
I bought a new jacket.
Replaced the lost jacket.
You did.
It's really good.

389
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.560
The one that you bought.
Yeah.

390
00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:57.000
I have not seen you this excited to do television ever because I am really,

391
00:26:57.001 --> 00:26:59.010
I'm just really excited for it.
I'm stoked man.

392
00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.780
This is in the great tradition of Latin television.
Yeah.
Of Sabado.
He Gone Day,

393
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:06.780
which is one of my favorites that we watched in Florida when you were sick once,

394
00:27:06.781 --> 00:27:10.530
when we were on vacation.
We want to
do this shit's Rad.

395
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.280
Look how much fun they have on this show.
Oh Man.
These guys have a good time.

396
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:17.820
Yeah,
man.
Not like white people.
White people never have fun.
I bet it's funny.

397
00:27:17.821 --> 00:27:21.970
One plot that Nieto is like off off camera and mad about something.
Right.

398
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.590
And he's demanding like where the fuck is my water?
And then,

399
00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.870
and he's in his clown thing and the PA has to be like,

400
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.280
how'd he say it in Spanish?

401
00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:32.920
What were the fuck is my water [inaudible]

402
00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:40.900
beat shower.
Pinch Jajuan say I have to take a chair.

403
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:46.050
I love that concept of mine.
Oh,
I like that.
Yeah.
Speaking of water,

404
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:50.070
um,
I don't know if you noticed my new container that I'm drinking out of it.

405
00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:55.470
It's a,
I got this in Dallas from a couple of Mommy's,
Katie and Trevor.
Thank you.

406
00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.350
Uh,
you can't see it,
but it's um,

407
00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:03.060
it says main mommy water champion and it's,
what's the word?
Um,

408
00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:06.720
where they engrave it.
It's engraved on here,

Carl's Jr.</v>

413
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:19.700

419
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:42.350
It's just nice that the fans really know who leads through other pussy.

420
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:47.330
So Gray Water Jambi in it.
That's so great.

421
00:28:47.331 --> 00:28:51.230
Can we always play that?
You can wait til if he is president.
You can do anything.

422
00:28:51.231 --> 00:28:55.160
Whatever you want,
grab them by the Pussy.
She's as Christ did.
So wait,

423
00:28:55.161 --> 00:28:56.300
you have to touch,

424
00:28:57.020 --> 00:29:01.070
is it a man or a woman in a body suit and then guests the objects?

425
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:03.530
<v 6>Uh,
well I saw what they did</v>

426
00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:05.170
<v 3>on a,
on a,</v>

427
00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:11.600
<v 6>so they sent me a video of it and what they did was they had a girl and then</v>

428
00:29:11.891 --> 00:29:15.370
they,
they uh,
blindfolded the guys and the girl walks away and a guy walked off.

429
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:20.340
Larry is so I'm pretty sure that'll happen to me.
So sexual,
Latin culture.

430
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:23.190
So that's what they do.
So the guys like,
oh how can we,

431
00:29:23.191 --> 00:29:26.740
I just have sexual you Latins I dunno.
It's all,
I think it's all come.
Um,

432
00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:29.003
<v 3>you know,</v>

433
00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:34.820
well who are we talking about that ran out of com watching TV last night and

434
00:29:34.821 --> 00:29:39.350
you're like,
oh he's a man cause he woke when,
where's the com?
Yeah,

435
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:42.040
cause he knows he looks so old nowadays.
You really?

436
00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:49.180
Yeah.
Well we were both noting that bill looks so,
you know,
he's aged,

437
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.010
he is a in dog years.
He's very old.
Yeah.

438
00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:55.630
And you said it's because he's out of comm?
I think so.

439
00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:59.440
We think Monica sucked it all out.
No,
I don't think Monica did.
I think it's just,

440
00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:03.400
you know,
with the years it's just gone.
The Km,
the km fades.
Yeah.

441
00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:08.170
He's really like more frail looking now.
Yeah.
Not that old.
Right.

442
00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.880
I don't know how old he is.
I think it up.

443
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.530
I think it's more startling because we're used to the younger spry bill.
He's 70.

444
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:18.310
He's my dad's age.
That's not that old.
Come on.
It's not,
it's not,

445
00:30:18.311 --> 00:30:22.480
he looks very sunken.
Like his face looks real.
Yeah.
I know.
He lost weight.

446
00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:27.060
I mean he,
he lost a bunch of weight after,
you know,
leaving office.
Oh yeah,
no,
he,

447
00:30:27.061 --> 00:30:31.300
he,
you know,
I think he changed.
I know you had hard thing and he has been sick.

448
00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.540
Yeah.
But I think,
uh,
well I can't do a lot of fucking,

449
00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:39.340
and he's an outcome is that outcome.
So I think you're on the right path there.

450
00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:43.450
[inaudible] you think I'm on the right path?
Yeah.
Yeah.

451
00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:47.680
Uh,
yeah.
Yeah.

452
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:52.060
We've been doing that a lot in front of our son Ellis Belching and it's fun to

453
00:30:52.061 --> 00:30:55.480
bourbon out of the kid.
Just go like,
he just looks at you like,
what was that?

454
00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:57.790
Is that a word?
Yeah.

455
00:30:57.791 --> 00:31:00.580
We're teaching him all the fundamentals of a good line by the pussy.

456
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:04.960
I'm my God can you didn't handle it that that's the future president possibly.

457
00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:09.670
It's so retarded.
Ah,
President Reagan's slogan.

458
00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:15.550
Yeah.
America.
America by the poster.
Yeah.
Make America grab it by the Pussy.
Yeah.

459
00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.690
Yes.
That's the Stutz dumbest slogan.
Grab America by the Pussy.

460
00:31:19.691 --> 00:31:21.720
I think the funny thing will be,
um,

461
00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.780
because there was also this a apprentice producer,
those tweeting is like,

462
00:31:25.781 --> 00:31:29.260
I was a producer on seasons one and two.
He's like,
man,

463
00:31:29.261 --> 00:31:31.330
there's a lot crazier stuff that I think the,

464
00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:33.730
I think that's what we're trying to get released.
Right,
right.

465
00:31:33.731 --> 00:31:36.180
But my thing is he's going to have like,

466
00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:40.120
that's going to be such an embarrassment,
you know,
I kept him.

467
00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:45.130
If it's way crazier than that,
why Chrisy yeah.
Cause he's probably,

468
00:31:45.131 --> 00:31:46.820
he's a bragger type,
you know?
Yes.

469
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:50.030
I know that he likes to brag about chicks because they,
it's,
it's,

470
00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:54.550
it's long been his,
you know,
his thing.
So he'll probably have a lot of like,

471
00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:57.670
you see that girl over there,
she's fucked her in the bathroom.
Yeah.

472
00:31:57.671 --> 00:32:01.450
Shit like that,
you know.
Wow.
What did she uh,
she say it was okay.

473
00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:05.830
I don't give a shit.
Just stuck it in her mouth.
How do we get here as a society?

474
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.903
You know,
I'm,

475
00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:11.290
I'm so bummed that we don't have cable right now just because I wanted to watch

476
00:32:11.291 --> 00:32:16.291
Fox News and I'm curious to see how they are spinning this into a positive

477
00:32:16.761 --> 00:32:20.280
light.
Well
yeah,

478
00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:24.060
it did he say grabbed by the Posey or did he mean it that way?
I don't know.

479
00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.180
Kind of turns you on a little.
Definitely does this.

480
00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:28.310
<v 11>I also,</v>

481
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:33.310
oh no movable to know which can be very sexy for role playing.

482
00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:38.520
For instance,
you might have fantasies of having sex with an athlete,

483
00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:40.220
like the hockey player.
Sometimes hockey

484
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.220
<v 3>players will lose a tooth when you get faced with the puck.</v>

485
00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:48.460
So I can give you a chance to live out your fantasies and have sex with multiple

486
00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:53.950
men.
Yeah,
I'll show you.
No,
no,
no.
She now I looked like a tough guy.
Like,

487
00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:58.220
like a hot red nick or a hockey player and I can put on wigs.

488
00:32:58.221 --> 00:33:03.210
I have like six different wigs and we can role play and have cool fantasies.

489
00:33:03.211 --> 00:33:04.044
The fantasy.

490
00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:08.120
<v 6>Yeah,
kind of.
I uh,
I kind of respect that,
you know,
you know what I,</v>

491
00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:12.520
I hate that I can hear how dry his mouth is.
All that stuff.
Yeah.

492
00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:16.550
That's the problem.
That's one of the problems.
I feel like I'm,

493
00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:22.030
one of the cool things is I think he's making a video just appealing to the

494
00:33:24.051 --> 00:33:27.620
public is what it feels like.
Now we're in the general,
not the Vegan.
Well,

495
00:33:27.621 --> 00:33:31.850
I'm sure.
No,
I'm sure it's,
it's for Vegans,
but I just liked that he is,
um,

496
00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:38.910
he's just making a video promoting why he's a sexual conquest in other words.

497
00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.940
Uh Huh.
Hey look,
another thing is great about me.
And he spun the,

498
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.690
the no tooth and little positive,
you know,
Sean sackers here.
Yeah.

499
00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:55.120
That's important.
That you can turn a negative into a positive and in his case,

500
00:33:55.121 --> 00:34:00.040
make it sexually.
Yes.
A pls convict.
Shine.
That's who that is.

501
00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.530
Oh,
so now it's that.
I'm

502
00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:06.120
<v 3>don't have this got a little bit of food on here.
I'm going to throw up.
Oh,</v>

503
00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.190
he's looking at it.
You know,

504
00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.780
<v 12>I know.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh</v>

505
00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:15.620
<v 3>he is.
So he is licking his tooth.
He is licking his fucking tooth.</v>

506
00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:20.310
I'm going to throw up.
Oh,

Oh,

507
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:24.420
pretend that I'm licking your balls are your penis.
What?

508
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:28.940
Dude?
That was really gnarly.
That was nor why did you do that?

509
00:34:28.941 --> 00:34:30.340
It's not hot at all,
bro.

510
00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:35.080
<v 6>That is so fucking gnarly,

I respect that.
You're trying to get puss puss,</v>

511
00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.120
but God damn it.
Yes.

512
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.950
<v 3>Wait,

Screw this.</v>

513
00:34:38.951 --> 00:34:43.750
Makes my tongue feel so haslup hitting the table.
I can't control it.

514
00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:50.380
I can't.
Would you turn it off in the throw up?
I love,
I'm going to be conferred.

515
00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:53.100
Shyness.
If I'm out and I'm 10

516
00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:57.560
<v 6>oh,
I feel like I feel really sick.</v>

517
00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.710
He was licking food that was on his too.

518
00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:07.810
<v 3>Why?
But why?
That's not even hot.
That's not even in the world of Utah.</v>

519
00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:12.100
<v 6>Think about,

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:18.430
I'm licking your balls are your penis or your penis or whoever.

522
00:35:18.431 --> 00:35:22.240
Whoever's around.
I'm licking.
That was rough man.
Yeah,
it doesn't,
it doesn't.

523
00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:25.220
I'm trying to sit up properly.
Have you noticed,
I wish you'd commend in,

524
00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:29.170
<v 6>Oh,
uh,
by the way,</v>

525
00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:33.220
budget people listened to the Burke cast with bill burr and myself and they're

526
00:35:33.221 --> 00:35:37.060
like Tom's breathing heavily to the mic.
We were smoking cigars,

527
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.940
<v 3>cigars,
right.</v>

528
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:44.670
You dicks also catch us on the last episode of the Jay are we did it last week

529
00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:49.170
if you guys haven't already.
Yeah.
A scene that heard it.
Whatever.

530
00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:51.300
Joseph Rogan's.
Yes.

531
00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:56.010
And I got a fanny pack from him and I was opposed to it for years and I really,

532
00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:00.480
really,
really fight for it.
Well,
cause when I take baby jeans out in public,

533
00:36:00.481 --> 00:36:03.870
you've got a diaper bag,
a baby I don't have,

534
00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:06.110
where do I put my stupid purse?
Yeah.

535
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:10.680
So I was cramming my pockets full of my phone,
my money and women's clothing.

536
00:36:10.681 --> 00:36:15.210
There's no pockets.
Yeah.
So I was forced kind of in a way to use it.
And I,

537
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:18.510
I'm a huge fan.
I'm a huge advocate now have a fanny pack.
I'm really,

538
00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:22.470
it's for real.
Mom's only really surprised me.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

539
00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:28.470
Yeah.
It really surprised me.
That was just so it grows really.

540
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:30.930
It had many layers and tiers to it.

541
00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:34.840
<v 6>Um,
shit a lot the other day,
remember,</v>

542
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:39.340
you know what was actually going to bring up was that,
uh,

543
00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:44.360
at my show and Ontario thank you to everybody that came to the Ontario Improv.

544
00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:48.760
Yeah.
Last Thursday.
Really Fun to shows.

545
00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:50.140
Second show,

546
00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:55.510
somebody punched another dude in the face,
in the line happening to our shows.

547
00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:56.610
And I,
I tried to,

548
00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:00.250
I didn't bring it up during the show cause I've learned that on a late night.

549
00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:03.850
If that already happened,
let it go,
let it go.
Uh,

550
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:06.490
I kind of wanted to bring it up later in the show,
but I honestly,
I forgot.

551
00:37:06.491 --> 00:37:07.241
But what I was told,

552
00:37:07.241 --> 00:37:11.890
what happened was a guy was smoking in line and another guy goes,

553
00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:15.220
hey man,
my girl has asthma.

554
00:37:15.221 --> 00:37:18.370
Do you mind going over there to smoke?
And the guy

555
00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:23.320
<v 3>turn around and punched him.
Wow.
And that was a late show Friday,
Thursday,</v>

556
00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.210
Thursday.
Wow.
Alcohol tends to play a role in,

557
00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:32.080
and that I,
that was a verified story from multiple accounts.

558
00:37:32.081 --> 00:37:33.370
I don't know if that's really how it went down,

559
00:37:33.371 --> 00:37:36.550
but that's what people are saying.
I thought that was pretty,

560
00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.370
there's someone got punched out in my showroom in Tacoma.

561
00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.860
It's come on your comedy club.
I don't know if I talked about on this show,

562
00:37:41.861 --> 00:37:45.910
but yeah,
a punched out.
What is happening to the world?

563
00:37:45.911 --> 00:37:49.960
What is going on guys?
Don't punched at our shows.
Could,
you know,

564
00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:55.090
punching people the fuck.
I like that the guy was just asked.

565
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:58.830
Right.
Hey Man,
do you,
can you go over there?
Fuck you man.
Yeah.

566
00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:03.800
That's some prisons shit.
You know,
could be more.
Yeah,
it's really neat.
Yeah.
Um,

567
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:08.710
I had really good time in Dallas and Poussin and Seattle.
Uh,

568
00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:13.720
and uh,
and uh,
Portland.
Yeah.
It's really fun.
Can I,
can I,

569
00:38:13.721 --> 00:38:18.130
I'm going to read you an exchange I had with someone that worked at the club in

570
00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:22.870
Dallas.
Can I,
can I read this?
Yeah,
sure.
You know when you come across people

571
00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:29.950
who give a shit so little the air like wow.
I,
I,
I kind of almost,

572
00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:34.210
um,
admire your level of not giving a fuck.
Of course.

573
00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:39.470
Let see if I can find it.
You know,
I switched phones.
Oh shoot.
You know what?

574
00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:44.710
I think it's gone.
Really.
I was using the phone.
I had no phone this last week.

575
00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:48.850
Whatever you want to grab 'em by the pussy like that and like just not Karen,

576
00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:51.550
like not caring.
I,
I'll,
I'll paraphrase.

577
00:38:51.551 --> 00:38:56.370
So I fucked up my phone and I didn't have a Sim card in it.
And um,

578
00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:59.980
so I had no way of making phone calls as I was traveling through Dallas and

579
00:38:59.981 --> 00:39:04.480
Houston.
And for me that's annoying.
There's no public phones anymore.

580
00:39:04.481 --> 00:39:08.500
Do you know that?
Like in the airport they'd ripped out all the public phones,

581
00:39:08.501 --> 00:39:10.720
so you can't even really make a public phone call.

582
00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:16.180
So I text this person employee in Dallas.
I was like,
Hey,

583
00:39:16.181 --> 00:39:20.050
I can only communicate if I'm on wireless.
I don't have a phone.

584
00:39:20.051 --> 00:39:24.160
Can you just meet me in,
in baggage claim?
And then we can go to the hotel,

585
00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:29.110
which is normal and I think not an odd request.
And he writes this?
Yeah,

586
00:39:29.111 --> 00:39:33.850
he writes back,
okay.
And then a few minutes later he goes,
you know,

587
00:39:33.851 --> 00:39:38.590
I really,
I don't want to pay to park.
Can you?
Can you just stand outside?

588
00:39:38.591 --> 00:39:42.360
And then I'll just drive round.
And I was like,

589
00:39:42.361 --> 00:39:46.510
I'm all pay for parking.
Just come in,

590
00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:52.060
you know?
And I'm like,
really?
You're that fucking lazy as a human being like,

591
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.940
motherfucker,
you can't park and walk 20 steps.

592
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:57.790
There's a lot of really lazy people,
right?

593
00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:01.660
To just meet the headliner of one night.
I'm just there for one night.

594
00:40:01.661 --> 00:40:05.910
I don't know anybody in Dallas.
Like I don't have a,
I'm a grown woman.
Like do

595
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:12.100
you have the arrangement?
Unbelievable.
Like,
Hey,
I'm here.
I'm at baggage claim.

596
00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:14.200
I should be there in 20 minutes.

597
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:18.390
You know that I'm flying across the kind of cross.

598
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:22.390
I flew across the country today for you.
And then you go and then they're like,

599
00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.273
hey,

600
00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:29.590
it's been like 25 30 minutes standing there like a doggy in here.

601
00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:34.570
I was here on time.
Why aren't you fucking here on time?
It's not a huge request.

602
00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:38.320
So then this person,
um,
when they shut up,
I was like,
he was,

603
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:42.610
he gave me grief for it.
He was like,
whoa.
Normally,
uh,

604
00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:46.180
just drive around a bunch and the person stands out there.
I'm like,
I didn't,

605
00:40:46.181 --> 00:40:47.410
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to do that.

606
00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:53.290
And then the car ride was silence and then the car ride to the airport the next

607
00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:57.940
morning was total Sila.
He wouldn't even talk to me.
I think so.

608
00:40:57.941 --> 00:40:59.680
Cause I was a little like uppity.

609
00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:02.640
I think that was a huge request for this person.

610
00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:07.920
Never to park and walk in and meet the headliner of the club for one night.

611
00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:14.020
It was so,
it was so,
uh,
it really made me sad.

612
00:41:14.021 --> 00:41:16.330
And then the next day that's when I listened to top 40 music.

613
00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:20.110
He was listening and full blast.

614
00:41:20.111 --> 00:41:23.580
And the commercials too would listen through the commercials.
Right.

615
00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:28.240
Which to me is totally retarded.
If you're listening to radio commercials,

616
00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:31.060
full volume,
and you're like,
I don't care,
whatever,

617
00:41:31.061 --> 00:41:34.040
whatever goes in my ear holes mountain,
I don't care.
Yeah,

618
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:37.000
you're fucking retarded.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So anyway,
that was right.

619
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:38.660
Am Am I overreacting here?

620
00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:42.680
I feel like it's an emotional response.

621
00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:45.740
Like it's,
it's what happens when you go like,
you know,

622
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:50.750
I do this pretty seriously and professionally about things.

623
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:55.310
Yeah.
And then when I feel like you slag off,
it's a,
it's upsetting.
You know,

624
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:57.980
when you don't want to put in effort to do something,

625
00:41:57.981 --> 00:42:02.000
it's like I'm putting an effort.
Yeah.
I'll put an effort,
you know,
to get here.

626
00:42:02.001 --> 00:42:05.620
I'm going to do press.
I need you to,
I'm going to do the shirt.
Yeah.

627
00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:08.580
And then you're like,
whatever.
And then he made me,

628
00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.460
he then he let me pay for the parking,

629
00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:15.260
but class $4 slash took my four fucking dollars.

630
00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:19.880
I'm like,
wow,
bro,
you gotta be kidding me.
Yeah.
But Dallas was great.

631
00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:24.170
Everybody's great.
Oh,
our fans are amazed.
I mean,
they're all,

632
00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:28.340
they're always fantastic.
They made up for it,
but I was like,

633
00:42:28.341 --> 00:42:31.790
what the fuck?
Unreal.
You don't give a shit about anything,
Huh?

634
00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:35.010
You know when people just don't give a fuck about their lives?
Like,

635
00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:36.830
how do you not give a fuck about your life?
That I'm like,

636
00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.650
I can tell if you don't care about this,
you don't care about a lot of stuff,
man.

637
00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:43.340
I agree.
Shit,
it's upsetting.
It's upsetting.
How?

638
00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:47.450
Just how it's cheap and shitty.
Some some,
it can be,
you know,

639
00:42:47.451 --> 00:42:52.280
there's some good clubs out there,
there's good owners that run it well,

640
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:56.210
that care,
that want to treat you well and it's not luxury stuff.
It's just like,

641
00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:59.500
you know,
care,
you know the care I don't demand.

642
00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:04.510
There's like just such bullshit on the other and then bring me a limousine or I

643
00:43:06.051 --> 00:43:09.160
demand,
you know,
Fiji water and my green room.
I'll tell you something like,

644
00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:11.390
I've think I've said it before,
but it's just so,

645
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:13.940
it makes you feel like shit when,

646
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:18.930
when they'll send someone with a filthy car to pick you up.
It really upsets me.

647
00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:22.220
We're like a car comes in,
there's trash,
trash,

648
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:24.770
and then they have to move the trash off.
You're like,

649
00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:29.150
am I supposed to sit in here?
Come on.
Like,
this is how you treat the person.

650
00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:33.620
Do what?
I mean it makes me feel like really disrespected.
It should cause it is.

651
00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:38.480
You wouldn't pick up your friend in a,
in a thick nylon like a work person.

652
00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.270
It's a work relationship.
That's the thing.

653
00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.990
If you worked in an office and you're asked to pick up an executive,

654
00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:49.340
you show up in a trashy,
I know like food.

655
00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:54.110
We'll just shows like it's usually from the top on down when it's like,
you know,

656
00:43:54.111 --> 00:43:58.340
it's like the,
that's how they run the club.
Yeah.
They don't care.
God Damn.

657
00:43:58.341 --> 00:44:00.820
It had been in and it had been a minute since I had experienced,

658
00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:05.000
I don't give a fuck like that where I was like,
all right dude.
It's pretty bad.

659
00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:09.770
Crazy.
Pretty bad.
Anyways,
that was my drama.
Yeah,

660
00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:13.270
that was dollars.
Yeah.

661
00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:16.190
I think I've had a pretty good run lately with that kind of stuff.
You know?

662
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:21.530
Pretty good.
I've had some nice wait,
so real nice.
Wait

663
00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:25.550
after four hour flights where you're like,
I just want,

664
00:44:25.551 --> 00:44:27.980
I only have two hours to rest in the hotel and they're like,

665
00:44:27.981 --> 00:44:32.070
just make it another half hour.
Yeah,
I'm almost there.
Yeah.
I've been

666
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:36.480
<v 6>picked up and you get have the traffic.
No,
it's,
no it isn't.
Or maybe it is.</v>

667
00:44:36.481 --> 00:44:40.950
And maybe you should've thought of that before you.
Um,
I've shown up,

668
00:44:40.951 --> 00:44:44.280
I've flown across the country like fully east coast,

669
00:44:44.281 --> 00:44:47.700
showed up at like 10:00 PM at night and the next morning have to do 5:00 AM

670
00:44:47.701 --> 00:44:48.534
press.

671
00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:52.320
They've been late or they haven't been at the airport and then my hotel wasn't

672
00:44:52.321 --> 00:44:57.090
booked and we had to frantically search for another,
oh my God.

673
00:44:57.091 --> 00:45:00.960
You're like,
really bro,
this comedy game man,
this comedy game.

674
00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:06.040
But Hey,
you want to hear everyone else was amazing.
So

675
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:08.203
<v 10>right.</v>

676
00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:13.760
[inaudible]

677
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:33.230
<v 6>Neil Warnock manager,
football manager.</v>

678
00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:45.480
<v 10>Well,
we won't tell you what we can do more than to play it in their</v>

679
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:50.500
fucking lead.
Getting pissed.

680
00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:52.483
Most passive.

681
00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:59.250
<v 6>Wow.
Love it.
I like the way he looks crazy,</v>

682
00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:05.960
<v 10>so understand that.</v>

683
00:46:23.810 --> 00:46:24.770
<v 6>I love that.</v>

684
00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:31.790
That's a wholly British.
Yeah,
I like that one.

685
00:46:31.791 --> 00:46:36.420
You never hear that.
I liked that a lot.
I do too.
Okay.
No,

686
00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:42.070
I like the long socks to mummy.
I'm wearing my lungs up.

687
00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:49.310
Did you play soccer?
Yes.
Uh,
third grade.
Yeah.

688
00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:50.090
That was it.

689
00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:54.110
Americans don't play it past third grade Gen ed now it's getting way more

690
00:46:54.111 --> 00:46:56.630
popular here.
The FIFO,
the next generation.

691
00:46:56.631 --> 00:46:59.330
Our son's generation when they're older,

692
00:46:59.331 --> 00:47:03.290
I think we're going to have more worldclass soccer players and then we're going

693
00:47:03.291 --> 00:47:06.710
to stop circumcising everybody.
I hope not,

694
00:47:06.711 --> 00:47:10.550
but I think that soccer is going to see an explosion because yeah,

695
00:47:10.551 --> 00:47:15.551
because you're seeing there's more public interest in international games.

696
00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:19.910
Um,
it's becoming,
it's definitely undeniably coming more popular.

697
00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:22.070
So then when that happens,

698
00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:26.210
more great athletes that would have played,
you know,

699
00:47:26.211 --> 00:47:28.880
football or baseball or something.

700
00:47:28.881 --> 00:47:32.860
You're to see more of them go to soccer and I think you'll see more American

701
00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:37.360
soccer stars in the next 10,
20 years.
It's about Tom.
Yeah.

702
00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:39.760
I mean we have some good ones,
but I think it's going to get even better.

703
00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:44.470
That's going to get even better.
What's cool.
Yeah,
me too.
I like it.
I like soccer.

704
00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:46.930
I do.
I like watching top level stuff.
You know,

705
00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:50.800
I don't have an interest in watching like a fucking high school game here,

706
00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:52.600
but when they,
when they have,
you know,

707
00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:56.230
the really premier league stuff and the World Cup stuff.

708
00:47:56.231 --> 00:47:59.380
I like watching that stuff.
Yeah,
it's good.
It's exciting.
It is.

709
00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:08.930
<v 10>Oh Geez.
How many times have we had,
I know.
I know.</v>

710
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:12.520
We don't want you to know.
We want us to fucking stop it.

711
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:17.310
<v 6>Yeah.
I liked going to cut.
Really loses it though.</v>

712
00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:20.410
Exasperated and he just fucking grabbing his hair.

713
00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:22.390
It doesn't know what to do anymore.

714
00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:27.310
That's the sign of real passion mixed with real anger.
Yeah.
Yes,

715
00:48:27.311 --> 00:48:28.420
I agree.
I will be like that.

716
00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:33.340
Now what part of the UK is this man from master of accents?

717
00:48:33.341 --> 00:48:35.350
Where do you identify?
Oh yeah.

718
00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:39.280
This is clear as this is so southern,

719
00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:42.040
not even a das.
It's probably from mercy

720
00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:46.910
<v 10>right now we got 45 minutes.
I'm not bothered by fucking unconcerned.
Yeah,</v>

721
00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:49.330
I'm at about now.
Neil Warren upside out there.

722
00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:54.040
Fucking 2000 finds out real goal and they will panic now.

723
00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:57.160
Everybody calls you trade a backpack.
Don't be stopped.
This shit.

724
00:48:57.161 --> 00:48:58.660
Now let's go out and get the fucking,

725
00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:02.290
<v 6>don't be soft as shit.
Yeah.</v>

726
00:49:02.291 --> 00:49:05.340
I think it's a giraffe arc or dark park.

727
00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:11.150
Probably Hubris.
Harrisburg or Durham.

728
00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:14.160
Third fired.
Yeah.
It's killing me.

729
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:21.680
This shit.
This shit.
Um,
I like it.
Speaking of International.

730
00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:23.880
Yeah.
Want to see some cool.
Yeah.

731
00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:33.240
<v 13>You happy with Rob Bark at you?</v>

732
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:38.110
You Go,

733
00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:45.590
you have it with rob live.
Bart Bruce Lowry.

734
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:51.530
And you are and dot.
Then Tom.

735
00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:59.150
<v 14>Oh my God.
That was amazing.
Oh,
Holy Shit.</v>

736
00:49:59.151 --> 00:50:02.600
That was the coolest thing we've ever gotten.
I know.
My Gosh.

737
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:07.540
<v 6>I am so regretful that it doesn't say in my,
I have a clip bank here.</v>

738
00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:11.800
Oh,
who actually did this?
Thank you so much.
Couple things.

739
00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:13.330
Nice bird.

740
00:50:13.331 --> 00:50:18.160
Crisler is so enormous and it keeps getting bigger.
Yeah.

741
00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:20.110
And he is indeed fatter than time.

742
00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:25.530
And I'm glad that it's something we're seeing the world,

743
00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:28.400
the world.
Oh,
Stan,
you know,
it's really great.

744
00:50:28.401 --> 00:50:31.150
And I liked the word teaching the next generation.
Yeah.

745
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:35.780
About how fat bird is too.
Yeah.
And I love that.
These little,
wow,

746
00:50:35.781 --> 00:50:40.220
that was cute.
So cute.
Can we adopt like 10 of them?
Oh,

747
00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:46.430
<v 13>Bart's Bruce Lowry.
You are</v>

748
00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:49.880
God then God,

749
00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:58.160
<v 6>that's amazing.
I love it.
And in India too,
you know what I mean?</v>

750
00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:02.510
I'm just going to text best file.
Yeah.
Nice to see this.
Hey Buddy.

751
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:07.100
You know what,
probably not make them so fad is if he spent some time in India.

752
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.030
Just ate something new.
It's so funny.
The street bart has a,

753
00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:16.170
a new special coming out.
Yeah,
it's coming out in November.

754
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:21.680
He's shirtless.
Oh No,
no bad choice.

755
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:26.450
So like even as the,
the bird is fat thing,

756
00:51:26.451 --> 00:51:29.060
Tom is fat kind of died down when that,

757
00:51:29.061 --> 00:51:32.510
when those like Promo Start Airing and oh my God and the stills of it,

758
00:51:32.511 --> 00:51:36.920
you have to promote it are going to be out.
He's going to get hammered so hard.

759
00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:42.290
It's going to be really,
really great.
By the way,
I'm imagining like a tag.

760
00:51:42.291 --> 00:51:45.570
Last show,
there is a new shirt.

761
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:50.550
It is the uh,
what is it?
It's called Dj.

762
00:51:50.551 --> 00:51:54.810
Dad Mouth.
Dj Diamond has a new shirt.
Um,

763
00:51:54.811 --> 00:51:59.210
I wanted to see if I have the uh,

764
00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:03.060
the thing to show you.
I don't see it here.
Maybe I have another email,

765
00:52:03.090 --> 00:52:07.650
but in the meantime I actually did the weather a few weeks ago.

766
00:52:07.651 --> 00:52:11.640
I played like a super clip of me doing,
you know,
regular new stuff.

767
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:13.110
I've never done the weather before.

768
00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:16.930
And then let me do the weather as Dj Dad Mountain.
Oh Nice.
Let's see.

769
00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:20.030
I wanted to show you that.
See if I can play there.

770
00:52:21.310 --> 00:52:23.830
<v 15>Hey everybody.
Welcome back Cwi.
We'll live morning show.</v>

771
00:52:23.831 --> 00:52:28.831
I'm James Peterson back on my side here in front of the weather wall with duct

772
00:52:29.131 --> 00:52:32.890
tape.
Also known as Mr Segura.
What's that man?

773
00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.260
We wanted to come and he wanted to come in front of the chrome.
Well,

774
00:52:35.261 --> 00:52:38.050
he's ever stood in front of a green wall.
So if you folks at home don't know.

775
00:52:38.051 --> 00:52:42.370
This is called the Chroma Key,
Aka green screen,
green screen.
I'm going to let,

776
00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:44.650
we'll let him do the weather.
I'm going to step out of here.

777
00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:46.240
He's got to tell you about the rainfall.

778
00:52:46.350 --> 00:52:51.330
<v 6>Let's talk about rain real quick.
Man over here.
Cedar rapids here,</v>

779
00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:56.610
man,
you got a little over and it says nothing.
Look at Spencer Spencer.
Man,

780
00:52:56.611 --> 00:53:01.310
y'all are wet mess.
So easy.
What does this deck,
Decorah,
Dick.

781
00:53:01.311 --> 00:53:04.710
Cora.
Cora,
they're not having no rain or that you just felt lazy.

782
00:53:04.711 --> 00:53:07.080
You didn't put like putting into the total.

783
00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:12.230
There's Waterloo is other places other than I got duct tape for decor.

784
00:53:13.801 --> 00:53:14.880
I'm not going to put it on the wall,

785
00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:20.180
but here I would cover this up that cause you guys disrespected the Cora and you

786
00:53:22.471 --> 00:53:27.010
also disrespected Davenport.
Yeah.
And let's see what else we got.
We're all there.

787
00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:30.720
We're going to,
we're still the skycam.
Oh Sky Cam.
Oh look at this.

788
00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:32.970
We'd like to thank our sponsors at Orin homes.

789
00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:38.310
If you're looking for a house and you have money contact or in home and they'll

790
00:53:38.311 --> 00:53:39.144
help you get it.

791
00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:44.420
And if something breaks we'll put duct tape on is currently 63 here and as y and

792
00:53:46.561 --> 00:53:50.770
the conditions are fake.
I even got in one of our dumb pronounciation.
Yeah,

793
00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:56.560
somewhat.
Somewhat going.
Watch this.
Watch this little trick.
This fool shit

794
00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:03.030
sweating.
It's not a health matters.
93% humidity.

795
00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:07.180
It is muggy outside.
The winds are coming out to west.
South West.
Yeah.

796
00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:10.080
Around six miles an hour.
If you don't have duct tape,

797
00:54:10.081 --> 00:54:13.200
make sure you pick some up today.
It solves so many issues.

798
00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:17.580
The core of not there on this one either.

799
00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:21.270
They're obviously having technical issues.
So that's a technical problem.

800
00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:24.480
The technical,
it is a good idea to bring out the duck.
Yes,
you could.

801
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:28.060
You could duck tape over them and we'll just get back to that set of blue

802
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:33.060
gaffers tape.
Here's your future tracker.
This tracker,

803
00:54:33.090 --> 00:54:37.310
you've got to do the,
I'm gonna put,
I'm a let you buddy.
Yeah,

804
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:40.350
it's just a wall of water there.

805
00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:44.820
And then Minneapolis is snowing very hard right now.

806
00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:49.170
And also in Kansas City there's a lot of snow in fire

807
00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:55.960
trackers,
letting you know that there's some rain in other things,
uh,

808
00:54:55.980 --> 00:55:00.600
or in homes.
Doesn't sponsor this segment.
Anything else?
All right.
No,

809
00:55:00.601 --> 00:55:05.360
we're going to walk back over here.
Dot.
Duck tape.
You Go.
Very good work,
Tommy.

810
00:55:05.361 --> 00:55:10.260
Thanks.
Maybe I'm real proud of you.
I'm here is the,
uh,
the new shirt man.

811
00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:14.640
Oh,
it looks good.
Yeah.
So it's a Dj dad mouth.

So there's an a whore.

849
00:57:57.311 --> 00:57:58.630
I think she called her a whore too.

850
00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:04.220
There's some word that we learned that was bad,
but she's um,
wow.
Really,

851
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:06.300
really fired.
Here's the beginning of

852
00:58:07.550 --> 00:58:09.140
<v 8>not in an accident.</v>

853
00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:15.260
She chatted a

854
00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:22.530
little bit of a big ticket to get with him for nine or

855
00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:27.730
10 to save her money.
Cause I mean

856
00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:33.530
<v 3>saving money,
nobody's trying to screw her over.</v>

857
00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:37.850
I love this dude.
Never,
but here's the thing,

858
00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:43.130
doesn't she sometimes actually see Salamay right.
And be like,

859

I never get your calls.
Never.
Yeah,

861
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:51.690
So dude,

862
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:54.890
I'm so stoked she's back though because I feel like I was worried that there was

863
00:58:54.891 --> 00:58:58.550
a lull in our relationship and now she's back again.

864
00:58:58.551 --> 00:59:00.950
So this is amaze.

865
00:59:01.610 --> 00:59:04.880
We need somebody who speaks Farsi to come in here maybe.

866
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:09.440
And do you think we should call her one day and talk to her?
I'd be like,

867
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:11.270
what's your,
you know what I mean?

868
00:59:11.271 --> 00:59:15.310
Like to wrap this up or I just feel like we need,

869
00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:19.790
we need closure on this.
Call her cause you speak some English,
right?

870
00:59:19.830 --> 00:59:22.070
We just car one day and be like,
I know you've

871
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:26.390
<v 6>been looking for Salamay.
She's like,
what?
How the fuck do you know shit.</v>

872
00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:31.130
We have to piece together all the translations first.
Kind of be like,

873
00:59:31.131 --> 00:59:36.080
I just want to tell you we have plastic bags on the tree.

876
00:59:45.050 --> 00:59:47.750

Okay.
She's in the basement.
She's tied up.

877
00:59:48.110 --> 00:59:52.610
You can have her back but first we want the password.

878
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:56.180
<v 3>Yeah.
Her and I've been getting,
I still get calls for Shanaze.</v>

879
00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:57.410
There's a lot of uh,

880
00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:00.980
nursing opportunities in Florida that she's been missing out on for the last

881
01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:03.030
year since I've had this phone number.
Yeah.
Um,

882
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:06.380
but then atus I stopped getting calls for,

883
01:00:06.381 --> 01:00:11.381
for adas cause he left Rehab early and they're looking for him.

884
01:00:11.601 --> 01:00:14.450
But it kind of makes me want to get a new number just to see if there's any

885
01:00:14.451 --> 01:00:17.780
exciting things that'll happen for my phone number,
if you're lucky.
I mean,

886
01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:21.130
I feel like this number,
it's a real blessing in the skies and it,
yeah.

887
01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.790
There's like once a lifetime

888
01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:27.600
<v 6>you give it out.
Yeah.

889
01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:30.490
that happened at that.
Joe Did that on accident one time.
He did.

890
01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:35.060
He tried to direct message.
Somebody has number and he tweeted shit.
Oh Shit.
Yeah.

891
01:00:35.061 --> 01:00:38.650
His phone cut down like it was Ron.

892
01:00:38.770 --> 01:00:43.090
Oh Shit.

901
01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:33.030
Oh,

903
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:43.070
Can I,
did you see nosy Rosie?
Oh,

I,
if it's too hard to pull up.
Oh,

904
01:01:43.071 --> 01:01:48.040
is that in your mind?
Okay.
I was,
um,
I loved,
I,

905
01:01:48.041 --> 01:01:50.330
I,
there's a few things Instagram knows I like,

906
01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:55.190
I like golf stuff and then I like tiny dogs,

907
01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:59.510
so I get a lot of the,
you know,
they recommend people's feeds to you.

908
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:03.230
And I found one under tiny dogs that really,

909
01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:05.740
really major struck my heart.

910
01:02:06.330 --> 01:02:07.300
<v 10>Nosy.
Rosie,</v>

911
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:17.150
what are you doing?
A nosy Rosie.
It's the weekend changing.

912
01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:20.130
What's your plan?
I will out and get drunk

913
01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:25.570

Okay.

915
01:02:32.350 --> 01:02:36.720
Do you want to go to parties and Jean,
I'm going to go clubbing.

916
01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:40.790
No,

917
01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.060
<v 3>Zeros anyway,</v>

918
01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:49.270
I think he wants to put on some high heels and go to the club and the roofing.

919
01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:53.440
Uh,

Yes.

921
01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:03.240

It's not him,

922
01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:07.730
but it definitely sounds like it can be stuck.
A button.

933
01:03:50.641 --> 01:03:55.230

They me to read it to you.

950
01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:03.490
Any common those balls.
Oh,
okay.
A deer's Mommy's.

951
01:05:03.491 --> 01:05:06.910
My girlfriend and I are having quite the debate about how one enters the shower.

952
01:05:07.090 --> 01:05:10.330
Go ahead.
I like a civilized,
educated and well hydrated.

953
01:05:10.331 --> 01:05:14.500
Mommy prefer to pull the shower curtain door towards the front of the shower.

954
01:05:14.650 --> 01:05:18.220
I don't understand her the back.
Oh,
got God.
And approach the water like someone

955
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:22.240
<v 6>who doesn't have daddy issues.
My cave dwelling counterpart,</v>

956
01:05:22.241 --> 01:05:27.130
whoever chooses to pull the curtain door back and enter directly into the water.

957
01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:29.440
It's as if she's so hydrated.

958
01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:33.460
The thought of being immediately boiled to death or frozen solid doesn't pass

959
01:05:33.461 --> 01:05:38.440
into her mind as the water temperature adjusts.
I'm sorry.

960
01:05:38.441 --> 01:05:42.910
It says if she's so dehydrated I'm willing to bet she even likes the vomit

961
01:05:42.911 --> 01:05:44.380
flavored lemon lime Gatorade.

962
01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:49.570
I'd greatly appreciate any input from the true water champion Tommy.

963
01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:52.510
And if the main mommy's Tina lips aren't so chapped,

964
01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:55.060
the speaking would split them.
I'd enjoy her input as well.

965
01:05:55.061 --> 01:05:59.680
Yours truly scooter macgyver,
scooter.
Great question.

966
01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:02.650
And you are dating a psychopath.

967
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:07.600
You absolutely are to approach shower temperature,
water.

968
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:11.950
That way you walk in,
you gauge the room,

969
01:06:11.951 --> 01:06:16.450
the scenario,
you know where your exits are at.
Okay.
And then you,

970
01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:20.770
you can even feel sometimes just by standing you don't have to touch water.

971
01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:24.730
You can feel the,
the temperature it's putting off,

972
01:06:24.970 --> 01:06:29.970
make some adjustments may put a hand or an Armin and then you slowly,

973
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:35.170
you kind of walk into it as you are finding the temperature.
You're like,

974
01:06:35.171 --> 01:06:39.880
you don't just walk in like a crazy person.
I totally disagree.

975
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:41.200
Well yeah,
but you don't know.
You're talking about,

976
01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:45.900
I've always entered when we had sliding doors in and Redondo jeans.
Yeah,

977
01:06:46.330 --> 01:06:48.280
I would always enter.
And the front,

978
01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:52.540
you mean you're telling me you would enter in the back if there's a front and a

979
01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:57.490
back shower like that?
I would walk in to the back and walk up to it.
Yeah,

980
01:06:57.620 --> 01:07:01.660
never.
I would always go and think about how stupid it is.

981
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:04.430
I'd always go in and then they go,
oh fuck,
fuck.

982
01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:10.040
Move my body around the,
I mean the only way that I would do it.
The other,

983
01:07:10.310 --> 01:07:11.470
the way you're talking about,

984
01:07:12.490 --> 01:07:17.470
the only way I do it like that would be if I was like testing the water to find

985
01:07:17.471 --> 01:07:21.160
my right temperature,
but if it's one of those return on it's running,
no.

986
01:07:21.161 --> 01:07:24.590
I would walk in and gauge it like that's how I didn't hotels.
I'm like,
all right.

987
01:07:24.591 --> 01:07:26.470
I know I've been doing it stupid my whole life.

988
01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:31.500
I guess when you changed now we give it for 40 years of my life or whatever.

989
01:07:31.890 --> 01:07:36.280
I've been doing it dumb and I've been just burning myself like walking around

990
01:07:36.281 --> 01:07:40.450
the stream to her.
She never too late.
Never too late to change.
Yeah,

991
01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:44.190
it is right.
I've been doing it dumb.
Yeah.

992
01:07:44.410 --> 01:07:48.940
It's like when you discovered the defy Yay Fi's yogurt that you can put the,

993
01:07:48.941 --> 01:07:52.870
the sweet part.
If you bend it over us over into the yogurt.

994
01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:56.410
I was doing it.
It'd be like going to a batting cage and being like,

995
01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:59.860
I want to see one come out.
Just let it,
fuck.
You'd watch one,
you know like,

996
01:07:59.861 --> 01:08:02.830
let me see how this thing comes out real quick.
Yeah.
God,

997
01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:05.020
I've been an idiot for a long time on now.

998
01:08:05.021 --> 01:08:09.170
Another thing you're being pointed out about you is another email.
Go ahead.

999
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:13.210
Called Tina the serial killer.
Something's been bothering me all week.

1000
01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:14.620
Tina talks about how Tommy,

1001
01:08:14.621 --> 01:08:18.350
the main money is mentally unstable and probably going to kill her and her sleep

1002
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:23.060
as we found out.
Tina enjoys watching men get brutally kicked in the balls.

1003
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:24.830
She laughs real hard at it.

1004
01:08:24.831 --> 01:08:27.710
She even openly admit she'd do that type of porn herself.

1005
01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:32.150
That's some serial killer level shit.
It's her torturing of animals.

1006
01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.740
Say what you want about Tom.

1007
01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:36.920
Finding that funny video of the Asian getting run over by a car.
Funny,

1008
01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:40.160
but Tommy is isn't offering to drive the car.
Tommy,

1009
01:08:40.161 --> 01:08:44.210
I'm worried about your safety and your wellbeing is watch your back buttons.

1010
01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:45.680
Carl.
Thanks Carl.

1011
01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:51.060
And actually I've been thinking the same thing and I've actually purchased a

1012
01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:58.240
room divider I'm going to use at night to make sure that I sleep peacefully and

1013
01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:01.550
safely and that I don't have.

1014
01:09:01.551 --> 01:09:05.750
You had to worry about because I do think you really get excited by that.

1015
01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:11.360
It's physical harm being inflicted by a woman.
You really get off.

1016
01:09:12.190 --> 01:09:13.023
Well,
listen,

1017
01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:17.480
you're forgetting one important aspect of that is that the guy is asking for

1018
01:09:17.481 --> 01:09:19.280
that thing.
Yeah.
Okay.
So it's,

1019
01:09:19.281 --> 01:09:24.020
she's not just doing it and he wants that and you're just meeting somebody very

1020
01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:26.870
sick needs.
So what's wrong with that?

1021
01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:31.400
What's more beautiful than she went to bed with speed?
It's a blanket.

1022
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:34.500
It's a beautiful thing.
You think that's a beautiful thing?

1023
01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:38.360
More beautiful than a woman kicking a man in the balls when he desperately wants

1024
01:09:38.361 --> 01:09:42.540
that to happen.
I can think of a few things.
Um,

1025
01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:45.140
something else.
Uh,
hold on.

1026
01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:51.680
<v 17>Let's see if that,
does that work?</v>

1027
01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:53.780
<v 6>Yes.
Um,</v>

1028
01:09:53.781 --> 01:09:58.781
something I want to point out to you last week on the show when you submit your

1029
01:09:59.331 --> 01:10:03.780
dirty ash tray,
please.
I think it's empty.
It's not all down,

1030
01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:09.040
but you know,
we got to be so nasty time.
Wake up nasty all the time.

1031
01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:12.330
Last time on the show,

1032
01:10:12.450 --> 01:10:16.910
God that you made a handshake agreement that you would eat.
Oh,

1033
01:10:16.911 --> 01:10:20.810
dog food.
Well,
the reason you want it to,
if you had a great hypothesis,

1034
01:10:20.811 --> 01:10:24.920
you wondered aloud.
You said if a person eats a bunch of dog food,

1035
01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:26.720
well their shit smell like dog shit.

1036
01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:29.950
I didn't come up with that thought that was a listener.
Okay,
email.

1037
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:33.290
It was not mine.
I don't remember that.
So I'm glad you pointed that out.

1038
01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:34.730
Not your thought.

1039
01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:39.470
So what I want to know is,

1040
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:41.060
<v 17>mmm,</v>

1041
01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:44.170
<v 6>yeah,
I want to do it.
I don't want to,</v>

1042
01:10:44.410 --> 01:10:47.410
you don't have to do it if you don't want to know.
Well,

1043
01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:52.240
I want to know if it's true.
I think that's a great experiment to try.

1044
01:10:52.241 --> 01:10:53.470
So what I have for you,

1045
01:10:56.590 --> 01:11:01.590
a bottle or a can of small and toy breed dog food.

1046
01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:08.020
Are you serious?
Well,
let's see if it has.
First of all,

1047
01:11:08.170 --> 01:11:11.950
you said you would take a bike.
You said you would take a bite.

1048
01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:14.200
So what

1049
01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:18.400
<v 3>about,
here's the thing,
we need to find out.
Here's a bit for you.</v>

1050
01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:22.550
It's a big deal.
I got it from your sons that he would lend it to you.

1051
01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:27.010
What we need to find out though is if you eat this whole camp,

1052
01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:32.380
we said,
okay,
let's see how it affects your,

1053
01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:34.310
your dumps and your smells.

1054
01:11:38.710 --> 01:11:41.260
Are we being serious?
You really want me to do this?

1055
01:11:41.290 --> 01:11:44.290
You gave a solid handshake that you would try a bike,

1056
01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:47.740
but we said that you buy me this ring that I had been eyeballing.

1057
01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:52.240
I will buy you a ring.
It's a hundred dollar ring and it's not that crazy.

1058
01:11:52.610 --> 01:11:57.070
But yeah,
for sure.
How much,
what's a bite?
I mean,

1059
01:11:57.071 --> 01:11:59.980
just if you're,
I think you should just try it.

1060
01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.160
How can you smell it?
Try smiling.

1061
01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:08.320
I've fed him this shit this morning.
It actually,

1062
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.940
well,
here's the thing.
It's not bad.

1063
01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:16.970
Now that you read all these new agey kind of books and things,

1064
01:12:16.971 --> 01:12:20.030
why don't you just picture that?
It's something else.
Close your eyes.

1065
01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:21.920
<v 10>Mm.</v>

1066
01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:26.240
<v 3>It's,
it's waffles with whipped cream.
Delicious thing is,</v>

1067
01:12:26.270 --> 01:12:28.100
let's see what's in this.
Is that,

1068
01:12:28.101 --> 01:12:30.920
so I feed bitsy and fefe every morning obviously,

1069
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:35.910
and Betsey's food smells like just a dirty feet and trash.

1070
01:12:36.130 --> 01:12:40.310
It's kibble.
It's disgusting.
But every time I opened fiefs food,
I'm like,

1071
01:12:40.311 --> 01:12:45.230
this isn't terrible.
It's you're holding right now.
And it's not,
it's,

1072
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:49.480
it's grody.
Like I know that the shit in it,
it's gross with the gravy.
Kindness.

1073
01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:54.380
It's not bad.
Smell it.
The gravy is not that.
Just take away.

1074
01:12:54.410 --> 01:12:56.480
No,
I'm serious.
Just smell it.
You don't have to eat it.
Just smell it.

1075
01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:01.190
It's not bad.
It's not bad.
It's not terrible.
Okay,
so let's see.

1076
01:13:01.191 --> 01:13:03.320
This is sad.

1077
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:06.710
This is Hill's science diet and we put Fif on the special wet food cause he had

1078
01:13:06.711 --> 01:13:10.490
crystal in his urine and it doesn't even have,
okay,

1079
01:13:10.491 --> 01:13:14.360
here's what's in this water.
Chicken,
pork liver.

1080
01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:18.500
That's all editable.
Brown rice,
carrots,
delish,

1081
01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:24.230
modified starch,
wheat flour,
potato starch,
pork plasma.

1082
01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:28.700
What's pork?
Plasma dried beet pulp.
Potatoes.

1083
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:33.680
Get involved,
but I think it is Quito.
No,
listen,
listen,

1084
01:13:33.681 --> 01:13:37.460
there's good stuff in here.
Okay.
Okay.
Mac,
magnus sulfate,

1085
01:13:37.461 --> 01:13:42.020
potassium vitamins,
e supplement.

1086
01:13:42.190 --> 01:13:46.670
Okay,
so this isn't bad.
Lic.
And I take,
I take all this stuff.
The fans await you.

1087
01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:50.340
What do you think?
Okay,
okay.
Okay.
Okay.

1088
01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:56.233
<v 10>Okay.</v>

1089
01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:59.790
<v 3>How big of a bite though.
You don't have to have just a little chunk.
Gut.</v>

1090
01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:02.603
<v 10>Yeah.</v>

1091
01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:06.560
<v 3>I was on road rules guys.
I was on road roles.
I can do this</v>

1092
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:09.863
<v 10>chunky.</v>

1093
01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:15.580
<v 3>How about if I,
do I have to eat a piece of meat or can I just taste the gravy?</v>

1094
01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:21.030
How about I just taste,
taste the gravy.
Is that enough?
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,

1095
01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:23.680
let me just taste the cause that's kind of what I'm curious.

1096
01:14:23.681 --> 01:14:27.880
Did the meat looks like Tofu?
It doesn't even look like real meat,

1097
01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:31.600
but the gravy,
it does smell delicious,
I have to say.
Okay.

1098
01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:35.380
<v 6>Uh,</v>

1099
01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:43.370
and he hit me in the ring.
Yes,
definitely.

1100
01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:45.193
<v 12>Aye,</v>

1101
01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:47.120
<v 6>go ahead.
Okay.
Ready?
Yup.</v>

1102
01:14:55.670 --> 01:14:56.180
<v 18>Yeah.</v>

1103
01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:59.240
<v 6>It's on the tongue on the tongue.
How bad,
how bad.</v>

1104
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:03.770
<v 3>Your eyes are a little watery,
watery.
It's like bad picture.</v>

1105
01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:07.680
John Soccer's taking his it,
you know what?

1106
01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:12.810
It's not,
it's not terrible.
Yeah,
it's not,

1107
01:15:12.811 --> 01:15:17.190
you know what it tastes like.
Like,
uh,
Vietnamese food

1108
01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:19.320
<v 6>that's so insulting,</v>

1109
01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:24.390
so incredibly offensive to like our Vietnamese friends.

1110
01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:29.470
<v 3>Like,
oh no.
Kind of like that oyster sauce like that.
The smell of oyster sauce.</v>

1111
01:15:29.471 --> 01:15:33.640
Like it's kind of actually making my eyes water.
Not Terrible.

1112
01:15:34.210 --> 01:15:38.530
Not Great.
Okay.
You got your ring.
Don't worry about it.
Yes.
Oh,

1113
01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:42.490
this email just not bad.
Just saw this email now.
Oh,
you nasty.
Why?

1114
01:15:42.491 --> 01:15:45.490
Give me some nasty Tom.
You Ready?
Yeah,
and put that down.

1115
01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:47.800
I can't believe I just put that up.
Subject

1116
01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:51.880
<v 6>line says x Dude,
ex dog food manufacturer here.
Don't do it.
Tina,</v>

1117
01:15:53.790 --> 01:15:54.700
do you like bro?

1118
01:15:55.090 --> 01:15:58.090
I heard your podcast today and heard about the dog food challenge.

1119
01:15:58.930 --> 01:16:01.360
No dog food isn't low grade meet.

1120
01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:04.330
It is the last thing left from an animal that can be salvaged.

1121
01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:08.890
I worked in a huge slaughterhouse in Texas 20 years ago and I work in the

1122
01:16:08.891 --> 01:16:12.250
rendering department.
All of the guts,
heads,
shit,

1123
01:16:12.251 --> 01:16:15.700
et Cetera is cooked up to make the raw material of dog food.
Also,

1124
01:16:15.701 --> 01:16:19.450
everything is washed down the drains and we cooked that to the water would be

1125
01:16:19.451 --> 01:16:22.080
placed in a huge tank.
The water,

1126
01:16:22.081 --> 01:16:25.720
we pay it in a huge tank of water and air would be bubbled up through that and

1127
01:16:25.721 --> 01:16:27.790
the fat would float to the top.
We would cook that up.

1128
01:16:27.791 --> 01:16:31.720
Two guys would throw their boots,
old knives flying cockroaches.

1129
01:16:31.721 --> 01:16:34.920
Rats under the algorithm gets cooked up.
All right.

1130
01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:38.620
You sold the Purina for dog food and we were behind in cooking.

1131
01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:42.550
We had the slaughter guys placed the heads into boxes to be cooked later.

1132
01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:47.380
Big boxes that hold probably 50 heads heads increase the cook time.

1133
01:16:47.381 --> 01:16:51.400
So that allowed us to catch up.
The boxes will be placed out in the sun.

1134
01:16:51.401 --> 01:16:54.010
We'd cook them on Sunday when the slaughter house isn't running.

1135
01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:57.820
These heads baked in the sun and became covered in maggots.
Okay.

1136
01:16:58.140 --> 01:16:59.250
I looked like they were covered.

1137
01:16:59.251 --> 01:17:02.590
They are moving from the thousands of magazine I'm going to throw out.
Thank you.

1138
01:17:02.591 --> 01:17:05.560
Yes.
Where that went.
All sold the period to make dog biscuits.

1139
01:17:05.561 --> 01:17:10.100
Don't ever eat dog food.
Oh boy.
It's all same two,
don't fall

1140
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:13.730
<v 3>for that fancy feast.
Bullshit.
It's all the same material we provided for you.</v>

1141
01:17:13.731 --> 01:17:15.560
Reena.
Add some other ingredients.
Right?

1142
01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:20.530
But the raw material comes from the gutters of a slaughter house.
I uh,

1143
01:17:20.531 --> 01:17:23.210
I had attached a picture.
I have more if you want more proof hook.

1144
01:17:24.110 --> 01:17:27.600
So you attached a picture?
Yeah.
It looks like this is what I'm,

1145
01:17:27.630 --> 01:17:30.260
can I ask something to eat it?
Oh boy.
This is the floor.

1146
01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:36.260
Oh God,
I need something.
And you feel fine.
I mean,
not right now.

1147
01:17:36.261 --> 01:17:40.490
Not After hearing that.
Oh,
I'll eat like a peanut or something.
Yeah,

1148
01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:42.613
it's not that bad.

1149
01:17:43.010 --> 01:17:47.270
Don't eat the peanut because then it'll mess with what you ate for the FARC Chit

1150
01:17:47.271 --> 01:17:49.910
challenged.
Well,
your dog or your shit smelling like dog shit.

1151
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:54.080
I think I've eaten a lot more before we can tell if my shit will smell like a

1152
01:17:54.081 --> 01:17:58.970
dog show.
Yeah,
that's true.
That's nasty dude.
You Nasty,
man.

1153
01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:03.340
I ain't no reason to be.
It doesn't taste that bad though.
Know?
You're like,

1154
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:07.820
it's not,
it just tasted like a Vietnamese food.

1155
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:12.110
Yeah.
Like um,
you keep going there.
Gravy.
Yeah.
Gravy is good.

1156
01:18:13.730 --> 01:18:17.570
All right.
Oh,
it's smelled okay.
I mean.
Mm hmm.

1157
01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:23.480
But the hard food,
I wouldn't eat the kibble.
The cabled nasty.

1158
01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:25.550
Yeah.
I wouldn't have done that.

1159
01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:28.760
I really wasn't thinking you would do that really well.
Not really.

1160
01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:31.790
I thought you would have put up more of a fight.
I was in Robert.

1161
01:18:31.791 --> 01:18:34.540
You stuck to your word.
Oh,
of course.
I was on railroads.

1162
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:36.830
When were you on road roads?
Shut up.
Oh my God.

1163
01:18:36.831 --> 01:18:40.040
I want to take the physical challenge.
I was season four.
We were in Amsterdam.

1164
01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:43.740
What season were you on?
He never did an Amsterdam.
Yeah,
he did.
And he's a four.

1165
01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:46.430
We did.
Okay.
Of course.
I keep my word.

1166
01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:50.960
You think I'm going to chimp out on a fucking handshake.
Gill chimp out.

1167
01:18:51.410 --> 01:18:56.360
What's that mean?
Oh No,
I just came home,
but I don't know.
How proud are you?

1168
01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:00.560
Proud of you.
I'll get your lollipop ring today.
Thank you.
Yeah,
it wasn't that.

1169
01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:04.100
Honestly,
not that bad.
Really?
No.
Don't encourage people to do it though.

1170
01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:08.120
I'm not encouraging people with maggots and shit in it,
but yeah.
You know,

1171
01:19:08.121 --> 01:19:11.900
I've always been tempted now,
you know.
Okay.
I can,
I,
you know,

1172
01:19:11.901 --> 01:19:14.000
if someone falls on the ground,
you can just go down and look it up.

1173
01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:19.430
Don't have to waste it.
Ate Dog food.
Yeah.
It's so crazy.

1174
01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:25.400
Try it.
Do you want to try it?
What would it take for you to try it?

1175
01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:26.573
Nope,

1176
01:19:32.170 --> 01:19:34.800
just the gravy.
The gravy is good

1177
01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:42.080
to what's going on with our mouth.
We haven't been,

1178
01:19:42.081 --> 01:19:46.130
I haven't been to a dentist since we moved here.
Dennis,
you've got gotta go now.

1179
01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:50.330
I can't get the taste out of my mouth and dog food.
What if they go?

1180
01:19:50.331 --> 01:19:51.620
You've been eating too much dog food.

1181
01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:53.840
We got you have a lot of cavities and all that stuff.

1182
01:19:53.850 --> 01:19:58.700
I started getting into them.
Speaks food.
Oh,
there are carrots in it too.

1183
01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:02.640
We're guilty.
We're guilty as charged,
man.
We're not being good.
Well,

1184
01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:05.540
here's why I wanted to wait until we moved to the new neighborhood before I

1185
01:20:05.541 --> 01:20:08.100
start going two ways.
Why not just

1186
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:12.370
<v 6>wait and then go for a checkup?
What if they are like,
um,</v>

1187
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:15.480
if you've been eating,
you've got canine teeth now.

1188
01:20:16.710 --> 01:20:20.010
Thank you for this.
Uh,
lost him shit.
Speed.
Um,

1189
01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:26.250
let's,
uh,
let's,
let's read it.
A listener email here to my dears.
Mommy's.

1190
01:20:26.251 --> 01:20:30.240
I recently had my bottom wisdom teeth removed because they were impacted wisdom

1191
01:20:30.241 --> 01:20:33.630
teeth,
meaning that they grew in almost completely sideways.
Oh boy.

1192
01:20:33.690 --> 01:20:37.140
I had large pockets in which food would build up.
Yes,
I've had that.

1193
01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:40.140
I did absolutely everything to get rid of the amazing remaining food,

1194
01:20:40.141 --> 01:20:42.750
yet absolutely nothing could do the trick.
That being said,

1195
01:20:43.230 --> 01:20:45.810
there had to be infected,
right.
That had to be something.

1196
01:20:45.811 --> 01:20:49.470
I went to my local CVS bottled waterpik literally changed my life.

1197
01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:53.940
I keep hearing that about waterpiks.
I can be honest,
because I have veneers.

1198
01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:57.900
They pop right off.
Flossing is merely the hand job of dental hygiene.

1199
01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:00.870
I would highly recommend buying one,

1200
01:21:00.871 --> 01:21:04.140
especially one with a variety of different attachments.
Also,

1201
01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:07.770
I found that with a bit of mouthwash or hydrogen peroxide,

1202
01:21:08.190 --> 01:21:12.780
it will truly leave your mouth feeling Amaz love you mommies.

1203
01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:16.620
I hope that one day you'll be able to experience the wonder that is a waterpik.

1204
01:21:16.650 --> 01:21:21.470
I got to do this,
Nico.
Thanks Nico.
We had one at the old house.
I remember.

1205
01:21:22.270 --> 01:21:26.750
We have a countertop.
I can actually,
yeah,
it was too small,
but yeah.
Um,

1206
01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:29.010
thank you for the email.
Go to your mom's house,

1207
01:21:29.011 --> 01:21:33.660
podcast.com and order your waterpik through our Amazon banner.
Uh,

1208
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:34.530
mommies.

1209
01:21:34.530 --> 01:21:37.890
I feel compelled to tell you one of the most insane dental updates I've ever

1210
01:21:37.891 --> 01:21:38.250
heard.

1211
01:21:38.250 --> 01:21:42.180
After dating my boyfriend for five years and hours of listening to you guys,

1212
01:21:42.181 --> 01:21:46.170
I finally gained the courage to tell him to go to the tennis.
Oh Wow.

1213
01:21:46.230 --> 01:21:48.030
And see how he can improve on his teeth.

1214
01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:53.700
We live in San Diego where we saw Tom at the American comedy club and Dennis and

1215
01:21:53.701 --> 01:21:57.390
Mexico are much,
much cheaper,
equally professional option.

1216
01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:02.220
He came back and said he has to get gum graphs onto his teeth.

1217
01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:07.220
Oh boy.
Here are the options.
Tissue from the roof of his mouth out,

1218
01:22:07.221 --> 01:22:11.520
graft it into the front of his teeth or from a fucking cadaver

1219
01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:14.490
mother fucking body.

1220
01:22:15.150 --> 01:22:18.480
I'm horrified to think that I'm kissing another person's mouth when he gets it

1221
01:22:18.481 --> 01:22:22.530
down,
but that's the sacrifice we're willing to make for a perfect smile.

1222
01:22:22.710 --> 01:22:27.120
Keeping it high and tight.
Come back to San Diego.
Audrey,
Audrey,

1223
01:22:27.121 --> 01:22:31.020
I got a compliment.
I got to commend you on saying something.

1224
01:22:31.021 --> 01:22:32.130
After five years,

1225
01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:37.800
that will ultimately make him feel better and look better.

1226
01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:39.750
You know,
it's hard to say those things.

1227
01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:43.620
She told him you should do something about your toothpaste.

1228
01:22:43.650 --> 01:22:46.160
It must have been pretty bad.
Bad.

1229
01:22:47.010 --> 01:22:50.700
If they need grafts and maybe they need to be boy.
Yeah,

1230
01:22:50.701 --> 01:22:54.410
but think about how hard it is for her to say something.
Yeah,
I know.

1231
01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:58.020
Just the thing you want to tell me.
Yeah.
Is that why you're bringing that up?
No,

1232
01:22:58.021 --> 01:23:01.650
I just think that it's commendable that like it's hard to do that and so I think

1233
01:23:01.651 --> 01:23:05.410
that's actually a loving thing to do.
I would definitely go for the,

1234
01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:09.340
the skin on my own mouth than a cadaver.
Right?
I Dunno.

1235
01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:14.110
I would have it explained to me very clear Spanish first.
Oh my God.

1236
01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:19.420
Oh my God.
Maybe maybe not do it in Mexico.

1237
01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:23.050
I don't know.
I Dunno.
I don't know that that's not necessarily the truth.
I mean,

1238
01:23:23.230 --> 01:23:25.660
that's true.
There's a lot of,
there's a bunch of teeth down there.
That's true.

1239
01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:29.500
That's true.
Maybe it's a,
maybe it's great.
I mean,
yeah,

1240
01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:32.050
it's gotta be hard to tell someone that for sure.

1241
01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:35.780
<v 8>Uh,</v>

1242
01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:40.740
<v 6>yeah.
You hear how much better that one was?
You know what I did there?</v>

1243
01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:43.860
I didn't force it.
Just let it kind of interesting.

1244
01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:47.310
Very Zen approach.
Yeah.
Hold on.

1245
01:23:49.170 --> 01:23:51.810
How's the dog food burp?
Oh,
hi.

1246
01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:55.170
No maggots in you right now because I feel weird.
I didn't,
I didn't like that.

1247
01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:58.770
Like all the other stuff that he said didn't bother me until I heard the
maggots.

1248
01:23:58.810 --> 01:24:00.020
Ooh.
Now I'm,

1249
01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:04.200
I'm trying not to think about it that I just ate dog food with maggots in it.

1250
01:24:05.190 --> 01:24:09.810
This is something I've always wanted to ask about.
I've never known about this.

1251
01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:14.070
I another email came in how to massage my wife for longer than two seconds.

1252
01:24:14.430 --> 01:24:16.200
It says,
after an unpleasant experience,

1253
01:24:16.201 --> 01:24:20.880
having my wisdom teeth removed when I was 18 and having sworn off at Dennis last

1254
01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:23.130
week before my 29th birthday,

1255
01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:27.650
I decided it was time to go back for a checkup after one of my back molars

1256
01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:31.560
turned brown.
Oh,
oh.
I brushed my teeth once in the morning.

1257
01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:33.540
I'm very good about flossing throughout the day,

1258
01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:36.180
but after 11 years of smoking and negligence,

1259
01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:39.540
all I needed was a deep cleaning in two fillings.

1260
01:24:39.570 --> 01:24:44.570
The brown tooth was due to me not having an adult tooth come in and the baby

1261
01:24:44.911 --> 01:24:48.810
tooth started to die.
Oh,
I've seen that.
I've seen that.

1262
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:50.190
There's nothing I could've done about it.

1263
01:24:50.191 --> 01:24:53.340
They said they can pull it out if it starts to turn to hurt down the line.

1264
01:24:53.970 --> 01:24:58.970
All of this costs me $100 what may then it's these days we'll cut you a huge

1265
01:24:59.221 --> 01:25:03.660
deal if you become a member of their office,
which for me is $5 a month.
Wow.

1266
01:25:03.810 --> 01:25:06.150
And we'll usually also throw in a free whitening kit.

1267
01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:09.810
Thank you mommy for helping me toughen up and make the appointment.

1268
01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:13.410
My tea firs are so much prettier now and my jeans have never been higher.

1269
01:25:13.710 --> 01:25:17.280
Tighter.
Stephen,
I want to say this too.
First of all,

1270
01:25:17.310 --> 01:25:19.770
we are on the fucking line that we have to do something.

1271
01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:24.510
I need to go get her to fees clean.
We do.
Secondly,
yeah.
I've had friends of mine.

1272
01:25:24.511 --> 01:25:28.260
Tell me with regard to other medical things they needed,
if you're like,
oh,

1273
01:25:28.261 --> 01:25:30.690
I need to have this done,
I don't have the insurance.
Yeah.

1274
01:25:30.810 --> 01:25:35.810
I know doctors many times we'll make a deal for you if you pay cash.

1275
01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:41.730
Yeah.
So you walk in and you just go,
I need whatever,
whatever.
Yeah.

1276
01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:45.960
Whatever,
whatever.
A lot of times doctors will make a deal with you.
Well,

1277
01:25:45.961 --> 01:25:46.850
I'll tell you when,
uh,

1278
01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:51.910
we got the panel of retard tests for Ellis when I was pregnant.
Yeah.

1279
01:25:51.990 --> 01:25:56.990
They want to charge us thousands of dollars and I called the company and I go,

1280
01:25:57.421 --> 01:26:01.930
we don't have that money.
Yeah.
They go,
can you pay 300?
Yeah,

1281
01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:03.593
yeah,
sure,

1282
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:08.480
<v 3>sure.
So it's all negotiable guys.
All negotiable.
Yeah.</v>

1283
01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:12.710
Um,
just yeah,
you just have to protest,
you know what I mean?
Anything else?
Jeans?

1284
01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:18.180
Um,
let's see.
We did dog food.
Hmm.

1285
01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:23.270
Silo domain.
High Water Flask.
No,
I think we're good.

1286
01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:26.210
All right.
And have leeway to try dog food.
I never thought I would.

1287
01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:28.700
Now you've got to see if it affects your farm.

1288
01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:31.700
Have you take a dog dump that we know it's a,

1289
01:26:31.970 --> 01:26:34.310
it's a great hypothesis that somebody put out there.

1290
01:26:34.370 --> 01:26:38.690
Maybe that's why their shit smell so bad cause it's all maggots and rotten stuff

1291
01:26:38.691 --> 01:26:42.290
that they,
hopefully next week I'll be able to play you some clips from not just

1292
01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:46.220
[inaudible].
I gotta get ready.
I have to go get ready to go get ready.

1293
01:26:46.221 --> 01:26:51.140
You got to brush up on your Spanish.
Yeah.
All right.

1294
01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:56.090
Um,
thank you for listening.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.

1295
01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:58.520
Here's the kick my balls.

1296
01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:03.650
I Dj Orlando Airport and those are closing song.
Bye guys.

1297
01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:04.843
Hey Mommy.

1298
01:27:10.510 --> 01:27:12.640
<v 19>Pick me as hard as you can in the mall.</v>

1299
01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:19.220
Hard as you can.
Oh,

1300
01:27:23.550 --> 01:27:24.383
okay.

1301
01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:33.820
Oh that's good.
Yeah.

1302
01:27:35.330 --> 01:27:39.300
Good.

Good.

Yeah.
Yeah.

1305
01:27:58.130 --> 01:28:00.270
Take me as hard as you can in the balls.

1306
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:06.660
Kick me as hard as you gain in the balls.
