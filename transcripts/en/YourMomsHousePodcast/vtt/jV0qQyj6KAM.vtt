<v 1>You're not ready,</v>

95
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.103
Christina.

She's got answers.

97
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:17.843
Starbucks.

98
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.013
Yeah.

99
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.550
I can't start with scissors.

100
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.510
Cornrow hairbrush.

101
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.620
<v 3>Use that marker and well,
I'll use a sharpie to stir my coffee.
Yeah,
cares.</v>

102
00:07:45.621 --> 00:07:50.450
Everything goes in my mouth.
Anyway.
This is why my immune system so strong.
True.

103
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:54.080
Cause I started my coffee with the sharpie.
I guess that's more your lane.

104
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:55.670
I'm more of a water guy.
Fuck off.

105
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:59.090
How don't you dare look what I did fresh.

106
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:02.953
<v 6>Okay.</v>

107
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.600
<v 3>I wonder who ordered that bottle of water for you because you certainly didn't</v>

108
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:14.370
obtain it yourself.
You're the mom of the house.
I'm the dad of that.
That's true.

109
00:08:14.371 --> 00:08:18.510
Moms,
moms driving.
So I've so many questions about this.
Number one,

110
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.380
how do we keep it in there?
It doesn't it rub it raw.

111
00:08:22.381 --> 00:08:27.240
It's a pull yarn out of your snatch and 28 days worth.
Well,

112
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:31.820
or does she replenish the supply?
Let's get some answers.
I need to know.

113
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.340
<v 5>A lot of my day I take</v>

114
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:39.590
that's been wound so that it will unravel from the center.

115
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:40.663
The staff,

116
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.700
I stick it up inside me and I pull out the and smell

117
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.460
<v 3>it.
Now you've been knitting,</v>

118
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.270
this is last year and a half.
Well,
this is,

119
00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:59.070
this is the Zealand way.
Where's she from?
She's,
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:03.600
This is the Australian method.
I use the Canadian.
I'm from Melbourne.
Yeah,

121
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.560
Male Bun.
This is how the the Malbournians do it.

122
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.630
I prefer the method.
Yes.

123
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.780
I put an entire Spool of yarn in my age

124
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.330
<v 5>and it's confining because I'm attached to this.</v>

125
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:24.890
So get off and wander around.
Yeah,
you can't really,

126
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:29.930
it's restrictive.
It's not painful.
I mean not the English,

127
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:34.850
the abs out of there.
So it's kind of put his dry,
he robust area,

128
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:40.670
<v 3>but it's got to feel like sandpaper cause that that yarn doesn't look very soft,</v>

129
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.530
doesn't look soft,
it doesn't look silky smooth.

130
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.220
It looks like it feel course on your little event.

131
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:49.490
Cause sometimes when you pull out a Tampon it rips it.

132
00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:53.430
If you pull it out and it's dry,
I'm just letting you know and that's cotton.

133
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.400
It can,
it feels like it's tearing out your vagina.

134
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.790
Well when you're doing the knitting from your asshole,
does it hurt?
It's

135
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.850
juicy in there and lubricated.
Fresh.
Natural.

136
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.360
That's got a smell.
Not good though.
Her,
her yard or

137
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.460
all Brown.
You're yarns the word.
What do you live?
What are you talking about?

138
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:21.630
Cause I smelled that monster fart.
You dropped crazy.

139
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:23.070
Now just to be fair,

140
00:10:23.071 --> 00:10:27.360
that was sick because I had diarrhea yesterday for the first time in a long time

141
00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:30.060
I had a seventh two sevens in a row.

142
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:34.020
I felt like I had to sleep like that joke of yours where you feel like you have

143
00:10:34.021 --> 00:10:38.610
to take a nap after a dumb.
I was like down for the count,
man.

144
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:44.700
That's intense.
So this is her look how proud she is.
Very bad.
You know what?

145
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.610
I think part of the reason she's proud.
Um,

146
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.000
not a lot of people that are the,

147
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.980
that come up with an idea or they feel like this is a truly original and that

148
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.130
evokes this.
There's no one has done this.

149
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:03.000
I guarantee there's nobody on planet earth doing this right now.
But her,

150
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.980
it's like when you come up with a really good joke,

151
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:11.510
she thought of that so pleased with herself.
So pleased.
Yeah.

152
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.353
That's good.

153
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.870
<v 5>So she's been performance wouldn't pay the performance.</v>

154
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.880
I don't know if it's a pile of like going to cut out menstrual side from that.

155
00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:21.880
Assad is

156
00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.150
a hell of a lot harder because I'm going to fucking

157
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:30.410
Yank Kevin.

158
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:39.440
<v 3>I knew that was coming.
It was just filling me with so much anticipation and joy.</v>

159
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.460
Look at that.
Yeah.
I mean I've seen that before.

160
00:11:43.461 --> 00:11:48.450
I get a period myself.
That is what the Tampon scarfs.

161
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.480
I don't knit the tampon strings.

162
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.460
That's what I'm wondering is why not just collect your tampon strings and then

163
00:11:54.461 --> 00:11:57.700
make a tapestry out of,
but she likes to go fresh.

164
00:11:57.701 --> 00:12:02.380
I get it fresh on the scene.
It's intense.

165
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.610
For our listeners who can't see this,
it's pretty spotty.

166
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.900
The yarn and certain points of it.
You know what though?

167
00:12:10.901 --> 00:12:13.750
There's this whole movement to stop period shaming.

168
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:18.010
I think I told you yesterday about those.
I'm not trying to period shame.
No,
no,

169
00:12:18.011 --> 00:12:18.131
no.

170
00:12:18.131 --> 00:12:22.240
I'm just saying that this is kind of a timely art project to this woman's doing

171
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:26.590
because there's this movement now to take the shame out of women's menstrual

172
00:12:26.591 --> 00:12:28.720
cycles.
Like there's panties you can buy now,

173
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:34.050
but you can like free bleed in them and you don't have to wear a pad or a Tampon

174
00:12:34.181 --> 00:12:36.550
and you just like let it rip and these underwear.

175
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.610
And then he just watched it and they're like super absorbent I guess.

176
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.560
But they look like regular panties.

177
00:12:41.561 --> 00:12:46.340
So I mean it's a lot.
It's quite a lot.

178
00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.020
Quite a bit.
Yeah.

179
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:55.090
I don't know if I'd want to share my menstrual cycle with everybody and a form

180
00:12:55.091 --> 00:12:56.920
of a scarf.
You know what,

181
00:12:56.921 --> 00:13:01.921
I would prefer to see this kind of like performance on.

182
00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.950
Let me tell
you guys the best.

183
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.860
What do you think he's up to today?
He's probably doing something with duct tape.

184
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:18.830
His performance.
I put duck tape up my,
I asked,

185
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.070
can we watch more?
Is there more of this?

186
00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:32.410
I'm so intrigued.
I love it.
I love this chick.

187
00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:36.160
<v 5>It sort of slightly uncomfortable</v>

188
00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:41.620
arousing sometimes when I'm sitting in the gallery,

189
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.900
people say,
you're so brave.
You're so brave,

190
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.250
and it feels really

191
00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.593
natural.

192
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.310
<v 3>I Outerwall he's put yarn in my pussy,</v>

193
00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:08.500
man.
Straight uneventful.
I think the administration does.
Maybe the,

194
00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:13.350
maybe the,
maybe the knitting with it.
I can't feel natural.

195
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.720
I don't know if I could,
I mean,
I dunno.

196
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.910
That's one word for it.
I don't know if I could bleed in front of strangers.

197
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.080
That would be the only part.

198
00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.250
<v 5>When I'm sitting in the gallery and meeting,</v>

199
00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:36.850
I get a lot of the reaction is people say,
you're so brave.
You're so brave.

200
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.670
<v 3>Brave men wheel whatever.</v>

201
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:46.640
Tensions,
duct tape pads,

202
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:48.940
intense.
A lot of crazy lady

203
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:52.680
<v 5>expectation.
Wine drinker shine.</v>

204
00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:58.390
<v 3>What made you vomit more?
You're a drinker or pussy.
Blood.
Urine drinker.
Yeah.</v>

205
00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:02.170
Cause Pussy blood.
I'm used to,
I've,
I've birthed.
Yeah.

206
00:15:02.171 --> 00:15:05.830
So you've seen a lot of stuff come out of me.

207
00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:09.130
Tall person came at one time.
Yeah.
And then all the junk,

208
00:15:09.131 --> 00:15:10.820
the cam comes out after him.
Yeah.

209
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:13.060
<v 4>Stitching up and there's cutting in that.</v>

210
00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:16.840
<v 3>Yeah.
This doesn't,</v>

211
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:21.400
I the only thing that bothers me as a thought of putting course yarn up my

212
00:15:21.401 --> 00:15:24.460
vagina and then pulling it out a lot.
Like I just don't think it's,

213
00:15:24.461 --> 00:15:27.260
that feels good.
Yeah.
When you,
you know

214
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:32.360
<v 4>our son.
Yeah.
Uh,
duct tape.
Yup.
Our son duct tape.</v>

215
00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:36.930
Yeah.
I wish doctors were there to duct tape me together.
You were all,

216
00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.240
it was all fucked up.
I fucked up.
And then the doctor's like,

217
00:15:40.241 --> 00:15:41.320
I don't know what to do.
And I was like,

218
00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:48.760
that'd be shut in Doug's table.
Be My neck.

219
00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:53.110
My obstetrician.
Yeah.
Duct tape.

220
00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.100
Huh?

221
00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:55.933
<v 5>Tape.</v>

222
00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:01.040
I think the expectation when you're shining the vulva that people are going to

223
00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.510
feelings of fear and repulsion.

224
00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:11.970
So by linking the vulva with something that people do find warm and fuzzy and

225
00:16:12.961 --> 00:16:15.980
benign,
anything boring meeting,

226
00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:18.060
long period of time.

227
00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.480
I hope that people question the fears and negative associations.

228
00:16:24.631 --> 00:16:26.010
They have like a nice lady.

229
00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.110
<v 4>Yeah.
I'm interested.
That'd be friends there.</v>

230
00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.680
It'd be interesting to meet her and be like,
uh,
she's like,

231
00:16:32.681 --> 00:16:35.380
what are you doing tonight?
And be like,
Oh,
you know,

232
00:16:35.381 --> 00:16:38.770
just got to Melbourne and probably is going to make it easy.
I'm performing.

233
00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:44.200
Oh yeah.
Where's your show at this gallery.
Okay.
Maybe I'll stop.

234
00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.350
What are you doing?
That's interesting.
Yeah.

235
00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:51.640
<v 3>She thinks that her shoving yarn up per coach and then having her period on that</v>

236
00:16:52.461 --> 00:16:57.260
yarn and then knitting with it live will alleviate people's fears.
Yeah.

237
00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:01.040
About anything as opposed to terrify them.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.

238
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.590
I'd say this scares.
They get terrified.
We're going to 51 50 tonight,
man.
Yeah.

239
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:11.330
Yeah.
Well,
you know I'm a French strokes,
different.
Same Strokes,
same strokes.

240
00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:12.164
Everybody's the same.

241
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:18.270
<v 4>A man that was a good one.
It's really good price and I'll do it.</v>

242
00:17:18.271 --> 00:17:23.070
Yes.
Soy,
Yardley fade.
[inaudible].
That's a Norwegian.

243
00:17:23.071 --> 00:17:26.910
Burt Chrysler is fat.
Throw that out there for people.
That was good.

244
00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:31.190
People submit it in different languages and we always like to reward them.
Um,

245
00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:34.650
so much talk about jeans.
First of all,
we should be mentioned to a,

246
00:17:34.651 --> 00:17:37.650
our Patriot petitioner,
patrion listeners,

247
00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:42.710
patrion.com/a mom that we are releasing the live episode from flappers,

248
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:50.010
uh,
on Patriot on later in the week a five gets access

249
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.080
<v 0>to the backlog of bonus episodes,</v>

250
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.290
rewards offered at different levels every first of the month.

251
00:17:55.291 --> 00:17:58.170
Really Scans of our notes from the month,
desktop wallpapers.

252
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:59.880
And we also release a poster.

253
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:04.800
Many of you got the Cincinnati far poster commemorating the infamous Cincinnati

254
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:05.070
Fart.

255
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:10.070
Many of you have seen the documentary film that 60 minutes made the little

256
00:18:10.711 --> 00:18:14.850
teaser that kind of revisited the Cincinnati Fart.

257
00:18:14.851 --> 00:18:19.851
And that poster went to a bunch of people that subscribe on Patrion.

258
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:25.280
So please subscribe to patrion.com/mom and got all the extra bonus stuff.

259
00:18:26.401 --> 00:18:29.100
And yes,
live episodes are definitely going on.

260
00:18:29.101 --> 00:18:32.970
Patrion don't bust my fucking balls about it.
Um,
I,

261
00:18:32.971 --> 00:18:37.971
there's a bunch of proof that it needs to be there and not as a regular release.

262
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:42.670
And that is because we released live episodes,
uh,

263
00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:46.890
over and over and over on our regular channel.
And you know,

264
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.640
even though I enjoy them,
you enjoy them and some people do.

265
00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:54.600
The masses prefer the studio show.
It's fine.

266
00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:59.870
I don't blame them.
Okay.
Don't blame him.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Um,

267
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
we got a bunch of feedback on a retarded stuff.

268
00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:03.791
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

269
00:19:03.791 --> 00:19:07.810
I'm really thank you for all the emails letting me know what it is that retarded

270
00:19:07.811 --> 00:19:12.250
people do all day.
It's definitely a retarded.
Yeah.

271
00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.710
When you say people retarded,

272
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:19.310
<v 0>so there's a whole bunch of,
you want to get into a,
there's emails,</v>

273
00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.950
there's um,
you know,
cause videos.

274
00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:24.010
<v 3>Yeah.
I'd like to hear,
give me an itinerary.</v>

275
00:19:24.011 --> 00:19:28.360
I read through a few of them and a lot of them seem to be very similar to what

276
00:19:28.361 --> 00:19:30.280
we were proposing.
An average day.

277
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.690
<v 0>Well,
it's all came out of your question.</v>

278
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:36.600
Your question was what do retired people do all day?
Yeah.
And,
uh,

279
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:41.690
we discussed that at length and then a lot of listeners volunteered.

280
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:42.763
Um hmm.

281
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:46.690
<v 3>But I am genuinely interested and curious and I,
I,</v>

282
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.230
I do want to know,
and I,

283
00:19:48.231 --> 00:19:51.500
I feel like retarded people have been marginalized in our society.

284
00:19:51.501 --> 00:19:55.100
I feel like you saw them more when I was a kid in the eighties remember on facts

285
00:19:55.101 --> 00:19:57.640
of life,
there was a comedian character who I don't,

286
00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:00.800
I forget what would she had Trudy.
Yeah.
No,
it was her name.

287
00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.940
Trudy is not her name.
You know,
tying,

288
00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.410
my shoe was a standup comedian and she had some kind of different,

289
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.730
the facts of life.
Yeah.
What's her name?
Trudy's or was that the big girl?

290
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:15.530
Right.
The big,
isn't that her name?
Natalie.
Who is faxing?

291
00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:21.530
You think about Rudy,
not a Cosby show.
Trudy.
Here.
Let's see.

292
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:25.760
Okay.
Here's the,
she wasn't not retarded.
No.
She would keep Jerry.

293
00:20:25.761 --> 00:20:29.480
That was her named Jerry.
She was Dan comedian and she had some kind of problem.

294
00:20:29.481 --> 00:20:30.080
I don't know.

295
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.490
<v 0>Oh,
we didn't see them a lot more and there was a whole life goes on.
Life</v>

296
00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:38.050
<v 3>goes on.
There was a TV show starring a retarded person and,</v>

297
00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.380
and that was kind of a norm in the 90s.
And then it's like retarded.

298
00:20:41.381 --> 00:20:45.040
People just disappeared.
And you used to see them working in grocery stores more?

299
00:20:45.041 --> 00:20:46.030
I feel like,
yeah,

300
00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:50.440
like growing up I always see them pushing carts or bagging groceries and now

301
00:20:50.441 --> 00:20:52.450
like you never,
I don't know.
Yeah,

302
00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:57.070
I feel like there was more of a push to accept them and society in the past.

303
00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.920
<v 0>Even that word,
you know the word retarded,
right?</v>

304
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:04.760
So from 53 to 73,

305
00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:07.970
um,
the,
the club,

306
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
the organization was called the National Association for retarded children.

307
00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.650
And then from 73 to 81,
it was called National Association for retarded citizens.

308
00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:24.080
And then from 81 to 92,
it was called Association for retarded citizens.

309
00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:29.180
Arc 92 and now.
Yeah.
And then they change it to the arc of the United States.

310
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:33.920
And they said like,
hey,
they said it.
Here's it says as the terminology,

311
00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:37.410
the words,
uh,
um,

312
00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:41.180
the met the term mental retardation remains the terminology used in the medical

313
00:21:41.181 --> 00:21:44.960
field,
right.
Reference in many state and federal laws,
however,

314
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:50.000
intellectual disability and developmental disability or making their presence

315
00:21:50.001 --> 00:21:52.730
known,
and we're doing everything in our power to make sure they're adopted more

316
00:21:52.731 --> 00:21:56.990
broadly.
So it means somebody retarded that's still like if somebody goes,

317
00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:58.310
he has an intellectual disability.

318
00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:02.620
<v 3>What you like,
what he's retarded,
right?
I mean,
we can,</v>

319
00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:06.340
we can flower up the language,
but exactly.
At the end of the day,

320
00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:09.040
I don't think it ultimately helps,
you know,
I don't think so either.

321
00:22:09.041 --> 00:22:13.450
And I don't think there's anything wrong with being retarded or we'll give.
Okay.

322
00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:17.080
<v 0>You know,
it,
it,
um,
they used to medically use the term moron.</v>

323
00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:21.610
<v 3>Right?
Right.
Yeah.
I know.
Or,
or a mongoloid.
Yeah.</v>

324
00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:24.970
Idiot idiots.
A little severe.
I think

325
00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.290
<v 0>idiot proceeded Maura.
But yeah,
they,</v>

326
00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.760
in the early 19 hundreds they used to be like,
he's a moron.

327
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.230
<v 3>Zamora.
Yeah.
That just means stupid.</v>

328
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:37.500
But to be retarded means to have a thing that is held back to retard some things

329
00:22:38.981 --> 00:22:43.270
progress.
Right,
right.
So maybe it's fire Ricard mentally.
Correct.

330
00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.670
Exactly.
Yeah.
And,
and you know,
I don't know.
I,
we grew up calling.
Yeah.

331
00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:51.410
<v 1>Retired people were trying to,
yeah.
See these temp jobs.</v>

332
00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:56.020
My job,
I learned the job slow kind of.

333
00:22:56.021 --> 00:22:57.760
Now I know it by heart.

334
00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:00.360
<v 7>He earns money.
He pays taxes.</v>

335
00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:06.050
He's just like you arc the Association for retarded citizens.

336
00:23:06.301 --> 00:23:07.134
Yeah.

337
00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:09.250
<v 0>Don't throw us away.</v>

338
00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:10.570
<v 3>Yeah.
See that's what I was saying.</v>

339
00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:14.240
That's how it's been playing since I got it though.
Yeah.

340
00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:18.610
Can we press pause and address no technical issue.
Oh,
you mean the file?
Yeah.

341
00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:21.190
Yeah.
You'll see this.
Oh really?
Yeah.

342
00:23:21.191 --> 00:23:23.770
Cause I liked this commercial because it brings up the point.

343
00:23:23.771 --> 00:23:27.370
I was saying that you don't see retarded people integrated in society.

344
00:23:27.371 --> 00:23:28.204
I feel like anything

345
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:35.470
<v 1>here it goes,
my job is the job slow.</v>

346
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.380
I know it by heart.
Yeah.
Yeah.

347
00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.690
<v 7>See earns money.
He pays taxes.
Yeah.
Good for him.</v>

348
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:46.100
Just like you arc the association for retarded

349
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:46.933
<v 4>citizens,</v>

350
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.910
everybody needs to feel important and have a job in life and a function.
I,

351
00:23:53.911 --> 00:23:57.530
I don't,
I don't know.
Well,
I wouldn't say he's just like me,
but

352
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.120
he's got your hands down before I go potty.

353
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:06.170
But he has her glasses.
He did have my glasses on.

354
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:10.370
But you're right.
I think there's a little more like hidden.

355
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:15.020
You don't see them in society.
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.

356
00:24:15.021 --> 00:24:18.740
I don't know why they can't.
Why?
You know,
I think baggers,

357
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:21.950
grocery baggers and cart pushers should be,
yeah,

358
00:24:21.951 --> 00:24:26.130
the grocery bagger back where I went in Florida and school,

359
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:31.280
they were all uh,
you know,
disabled guys.
Yeah.
Good job.

360
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:34.140
It's a fun job.
It's funny.
He's always do this to Charles.
Um,

361
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:38.600
so the guy would bag our groceries and then at this place they walk you to the

362
00:24:38.601 --> 00:24:40.160
car.
They put them in the car for you.

363
00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:44.840
So when he put them in the car and he'd walk away,
my mom,
good,
thank you.

364
00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:47.930
And I'd be like,
mom,
there's something different about that guy.

365
00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:54.890
I would play it real serious.
Did he seem like a little offer?
Something?

366
00:24:54.891 --> 00:24:56.670
She like dummy.
He said.

367
00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:01.910
And that's the thing about people that have English as a second language.

368
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:07.630
They don't move along with the Times as terms of rat a PC watering down.

369
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:11.520
They don't do it because they just learn a word.
Like that's the word.
Yeah.

370
00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.470
One of the hardest I ever Lau.
It was like fucked up and it was,
you know,

371
00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:17.900
almost mean,
but it was so innocent on her behalf.

372
00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:23.290
One of her friends had a son who had like some severe mental disability and she

373
00:25:24.861 --> 00:25:27.380
came over to the house and the kid was like older than me,

374
00:25:27.381 --> 00:25:31.700
so he was 30 when I was 20 right.
So we're at the house and she's like,

375
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.990
oh,
you know my friend Roxie her,
yeah,
she has to go do this thing.

376
00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.980
She just to take him somewhere today.
And I'm like,
just take her son somewhere.

377
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:44.990
And she goes,
well you know,
and her friends right there.
And she's like,
yeah,

378
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:48.680
I have to do a lot of things for him.
And I was like,
oh.
And my mom goes,

379
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:50.780
her son's retarded.
And I was like,

380
00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:54.920
and I like in the middle of a conversation,

381
00:25:55.700 --> 00:26:00.500
I just walked into another room and I was like,
and then she came in,

382
00:26:00.501 --> 00:26:03.860
she's like,
I know you are laughing.
I go,

383
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:10.380
he just called her son retarded to her face.
And she's like,
well,
and I go,

384
00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.050
it's not that cause I was going like on the other actors.

385
00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:17.720
Like you can't say that because right.
And then right away Roxy was like,
ah,

386
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:22.400
he's a,
she goes,
he has a learning disability.
And I go,
oh,

387
00:26:22.401 --> 00:26:26.770
okay,
okay.
But I just,
I lost you set.
So anyways,
here's uh,

388
00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.420
one of the emails we got.
Hey guys,
huge fan.

389
00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:33.290
I wanted to give you a few fun facts about what people with mental disabilities

390
00:26:33.291 --> 00:26:36.110
do during the day since mommy jeans was curious.

391
00:26:36.111 --> 00:26:40.250
I used to work at a center here in Vegas that provides job placement and

392
00:26:40.251 --> 00:26:44.160
training for the disabled.
Tommy's correct.
Tons of sugar.

393
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:47.880
You would see a lot of them walk around with two liters of soda in their hands

394
00:26:47.881 --> 00:26:51.180
at all times.
Yeah.
They don't have that mechanism,

395
00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:53.250
but then take it away from them.

396
00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:57.140
A lot of them drive themselves to work every day.
Keep that in mind.

397
00:26:57.141 --> 00:26:59.850
I kind of got a crosswalk or on the freeway,
uh,

398
00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.050
the majority live in state funded group homes with or with their parents.

399
00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:08.280
They fuck like rabbits anytime,
anywhere.
But if you have down syndrome,

400
00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.230
you are sterile.
So there's that.

401
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:13.650
The majority of them are smart enough to know that they are mentally disabled.

402
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.440
Oh.
In my experience,
my experience,

403
00:27:16.441 --> 00:27:19.950
there were several male employees who when they were walking towards the

404
00:27:19.951 --> 00:27:20.784
restroom,

405
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:25.320
which start dropping their pants around their ankles well before they entered

406
00:27:25.321 --> 00:27:29.510
the restroom and when usually come out at the same time.
Yeah,
no,
I know.

407
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.950
Um,
it's interesting.
Every time I saw a naked man with down's syndrome,

408
00:27:34.951 --> 00:27:38.820
he had a massive hawk every single time.

409
00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:43.710
Love the show.
Keep up the good work.
Gabriel.
Thank you,
Gabriel.

410
00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.190
Nailed it.
Sure.
God,
I hate that they're eating so much.

411
00:27:47.191 --> 00:27:50.640
Should you have another email you want it to read?
No.
I want it to share though.

412
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:54.210
I have a,
um,
I don't know if he's retarded,
but he's,

413
00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:55.860
he's a slow,

414
00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.550
my cousin Chubba in Hungary.

415
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.260
He came to stay with me like I was a teenager and my dad tried to teach him how

416
00:28:04.261 --> 00:28:07.500
to fix forklifts and stuff.
And my dad was like,

417
00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.250
I think jumbos would have thought it did.
Yeah.

418
00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.320
Because his parents had that blood type saying we're two people of the blood

419
00:28:13.321 --> 00:28:14.430
type,
shouldn't have children.

420
00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:19.790
And that was Chubba and he's in his forties and he lives at home and Budapest

421
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:24.840
and he rides his bicycle around the city and he looks for Ufo.
Yeah,

422
00:28:24.841 --> 00:28:28.710
he's different.
Yeah,
he's touched.
That's all he does.
Yeah,
he,
he,

423
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:31.110
he believes in aliens and he's trying to find it.

424
00:28:31.111 --> 00:28:35.560
He loves to ride his bicycle and he bakes and stuff like that.
Like so I mean,

425
00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.690
you know,
he's got a job in a bakery contributing.

426
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:43.350
He's got a full life so that's cool.
Um,
here we go.
Mommy's,

427
00:28:43.351 --> 00:28:47.670
I'm the librarian at a special needs school librarian at floor in Florida.

428
00:28:47.671 --> 00:28:50.400
I work at the school for over 10 years and I've seen some shit.

429
00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.610
My girl is a high school teacher and work through as well.
We love your show.

430
00:28:53.611 --> 00:28:56.550
I have to say,
I envy our students,
honesty,

431
00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:00.630
brutal honesty and some cases their total lack of inhibition.

432
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:04.020
I enjoy their company more than most people.
If anything,

433
00:29:04.021 --> 00:29:06.660
there are a lot like you always doing is saying hilarious stuff.

434
00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:08.500
I see Tom is coming to camp on,

435
00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.490
maybe I can find him an opener.
Lol.
Um,

436
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:19.500
also watch out for special kids.
They have Pika Pica,
Pica,

437
00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:21.210
they eat everything.
I,

438
00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:26.310
because when you eat like chips on the wall and you eat dirt,
are you?

439
00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.560
Oh No.
I said don't.
Were you pulling out your,
I don't know.

440
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:32.790
It's either you pull out all your hair or you eat.
I think it says,
like he said,

441
00:29:32.791 --> 00:29:36.480
I've seen one slam a gallon of water in record time.
Okay.

442
00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:41.260
So you maybe maybe retarded guys.
The water champ that's we should look for.
Hmm.

443
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.500
<v 3>Hmm.
Interesting.</v>

444
00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:47.670
<v 0>Mommy's,
I'm writing in a listening lab.
So regarding daily life as a retard,</v>

445
00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:52.890
my wife worked as a live in caregiver for two women who were retarded.

446
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:57.030
Uh,
both,
I believe in their forties old for a retard,
right,
Tina?

447
00:29:57.090 --> 00:30:00.060
<v 3>Yeah.
There I'm old for a retard.</v>

448
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:04.880
<v 0>Their day,
however,
was not all been licking,
been flicking and sugary treats.</v>

449
00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:09.860
Ladies were up early,
had a day program.
They went to find odd job places,

450
00:30:09.861 --> 00:30:10.820
went on field trips,

451
00:30:10.821 --> 00:30:13.880
learned skills that might allow them to one to live on their own.

452
00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:17.630
Then they would go home,
go for walks,
watch TV,
dinner.
Oh,

453
00:30:17.631 --> 00:30:21.470
I'm sorry to inform you that it's not all day old donuts in porn marathons.

454
00:30:21.471 --> 00:30:25.760
It's actually pretty boring and much similar to the life of maybe a grade school

455
00:30:25.761 --> 00:30:28.170
kid.
Yeah.
Okay.
Interesting.
Andrew.
Thanks.

456
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:30.540
<v 3>Yeah.
Interesting.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

457
00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:35.900
You know what's interesting too is when I had diarrhea yesterday that I felt the

458
00:30:36.181 --> 00:30:38.700
need.
Now tell me if you do this.
Yeah.

459
00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:41.160
It's like a weird thing where when I have diarrhea,

460
00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:43.140
<v 0>I'm sorry.
This just caught my idea,</v>

461
00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.960
my eye that an actual retarded person just wrote it.

462
00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:49.530
<v 3>Not really.
I don't think it's really real.
Go ahead and read it.</v>

463
00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:51.280
<v 0>It says,
my name is Mike.</v>

464
00:30:51.281 --> 00:30:54.850
I want to tell you about an average day for me as a 28 year old retarded person.

465
00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:59.170
Okay.
Before I begin,
I want to be known that Tina is the main mommy.

466
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:03.850
<v 3>See,
I think it's a joke.
Oh,
okay.
You read that one?
Yeah.</v>

467
00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:05.080
Okay,
nevermind.
Go ahead.

468
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:08.450
Let's talk about you're having a thought and I really wish she would respect,

469
00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.170
I'm sorry,
I just caught my eye.
Okay.

470
00:31:11.171 --> 00:31:15.580
So it's a very important subject.
Okay.
I had diarrhea yesterday,

471
00:31:15.581 --> 00:31:16.780
as I said twice,

472
00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:22.370
and I felt the need to strip down.
Yeah.

473
00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:25.780
Like I had to take off my pants man anywhere and I wanted to take off my shirt.

474
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:29.410
I know those completely naked.
They're not even date their night,
weekly,

475
00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:33.910
once every few months.
Those dumps where you're like,
I got to change.

476
00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:38.200
I've got to get naked and why do I have to get naked before I like,

477
00:31:38.201 --> 00:31:40.390
what is it that like you have to

478
00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:44.300
<v 0>going to battle.
You're know you're going to war.
You know why?</v>

479
00:31:44.301 --> 00:31:46.640
Where are your good clothes?
Don't want any Sunday best.

480
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.230
You're about to go wade through us

481
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:52.930
<v 3>dorm right now.
I just feel like I got to get clothes off of me.</v>

482
00:31:52.931 --> 00:31:56.840
Like when I'm in pain or something.
I know exactly how you feel.
Yeah.
Oh,

483
00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:57.760
it was so weird.

484
00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:01.030
<v 0>Big Shit.
By the way,
speaking of this,
uh,</v>

485
00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:05.050
disabled people's inability to control their sugar intake.

486
00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:10.420
<v 3>Do you have a contribution?
Yeah,
I kind of broke down on a,</v>

487
00:32:10.421 --> 00:32:14.350
I had an incident.
You put gas in the car?
Yeah.
I don't know what happened to me,

488
00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:18.640
but this morning I dropped the dogs off at the groomer and then I had to put gas

489
00:32:18.641 --> 00:32:23.260
in the car and like I went inside to get some hand sanitizer because I fucking,

490
00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:25.850
well every time you pump gas,
you know your hands are dirty.
Yeah.

491
00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:26.743
It makes me crazy.

492
00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:31.510
And I know this about myself that I love those sour straws.

493
00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:34.330
Now there's a bunch of other candies that are sour,

494
00:32:34.331 --> 00:32:38.530
but these are my favorites there.
Strawberry in the apple sour punch straws.
Yup.

495
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.010
And so I bought a pack of each and,

496
00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:47.090
and then I devoured both of them.
And it's 11 in the morning.

497
00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:51.350
You must have really crushed it too.
I don't know what came over me.
I was

498
00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:56.870
like,
I,
and um,
when I start opening and I eat those packages,

499
00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.720
I have to have the whole package too.
It's really bad.

500
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:03.140
Today is day five for me with no sugar.
How are you feeling?

501
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.080
You actually feel pretty normal now.
Really.

502
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:09.710
The first 48 hours to 72 hours of the worst.
You are grumpy.
Saurus yeah,
I know.

503
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:13.590
Sorry.
He went to get a facial with the Russians.
Yeah.

504
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:15.950
And feel good.
You look great.

505
00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:19.330
<v 0>Um,
it was really bad.
It was really bad.</v>

506
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.190
The nose was just filthy.
I don't wash my face.

507
00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:28.110
<v 3>Yeah,
I know.
So you just don't wash it ever.
Yeah.</v>

508
00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:32.130
I told you what to use.
Did you use it last night to wash your face?

509
00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:36.070
<v 0>Um,
that's a no.
Yes.
No,
no I did.
I didn't use that one.</v>

510
00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.400
I use the one in the shower that you said is not the scrub.
The other one.
Yeah,

511
00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:41.490
<v 3>the salt.
Yeah.
That's a good one.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

512
00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.090
So then you went to ended the Russian lady go like,

513
00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.560
<v 0>you're really fucked up.
No,
she goes,
there's room for improvement.</v>

514
00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:52.220
You know the one thing I didn't realize about facial,

515
00:33:52.221 --> 00:33:56.870
because I think I've only done it one other time is uh,
how much theirs,

516
00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:00.360
they're just not there.
How much calmer frizzly come on.

517
00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:04.190
Like six guys telling your face softens the skin.
Yeah.
And then they're like,

518
00:34:04.191 --> 00:34:05.690
open your mouth,
open your mouth.
And you're like,
oh yeah,

519
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:08.060
I thought it was just from my face.
Well you can open your mouth.

520
00:34:08.061 --> 00:34:11.990
It's not mandatory,
but that,
um,
she's like,
okay,

521
00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:16.070
like sets you up,
rubbed something on your face,
puts the steamer here.

522
00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:18.980
And then she's like,
I'll be back.
Yeah,
I know.
And you're like,
all right.

523
00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.210
And then she just leaves for 10,
15 minutes.
It's Freaky,
right?
Cause you're like,

524
00:34:23.211 --> 00:34:27.560
did she forget about me?
Yeah.
Then she comes back.
Okay,
let's see.

525
00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:28.933
Okay.

526
00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:32.980
<v 3>And they put that but mirror or not the mirror,
the glass over.</v>

527
00:34:32.981 --> 00:34:37.570
You look at the magnifying glass.
I want that man.
Yes,
I have one.

528
00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:42.070
You do?
Oh yeah.
All girls do.
It's our secret.
It's your secret.
It's my secret.

529
00:34:42.071 --> 00:34:45.520
She did she give you a nice little shoulder rub?

530
00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:50.830
<v 0>Uh,
not really know what you're supposed to get.
One while your face gets steamed.</v>

531
00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:56.200
Um,
Babe,
what?
We had another retarded email.
It just came in right now.

532
00:34:56.201 --> 00:35:00.410
Okay.
Hi.
Hi Tom.
Zero High Push Trina.
Okay.

533
00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:04.150
It's not a retarded person.
I'm a big boy who goes to a fun school.

534
00:35:04.151 --> 00:35:09.070
I have friends.
Okay,
stupid.

535
00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:14.440
So dumb.
He says,
I don't like,
I don't like correct Christina.

536
00:35:14.441 --> 00:35:17.860
Budzinski her jokes are too hard.
My teachers like her.

537
00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:21.970
I think Tom is funny.
I like Tom,
my friends like Tom.

538
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:24.880
I see you're the retarded people's comment.
Yeah,
you're right.

539
00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:26.480
<v 3>I've told you this for so long.</v>

540
00:35:26.481 --> 00:35:29.750
When are you going to go and make your act retarded man.

541
00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:33.500
<v 0>Anyways,
I appreciate all the input,</v>

542
00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:37.200
all the interesting things everybody told us about this.

543
00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.420
<v 3>Yeah,
that was interesting.
I never thought we'd go down that tangent,
but we did.</v>

544
00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:43.630
We did.
Yep.
And I liked the,
uh,
the,
the,

545
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:48.670
that some retarded people know they are because that was a big debate for us in

546
00:35:49.401 --> 00:35:52.910
that infamous,
would you rather that I dropped months ago?

547
00:35:52.911 --> 00:35:56.720
Would you rather be retarded or get jerked off by your grandfather on the Ferris

548
00:35:56.721 --> 00:36:01.370
wheel?
And the big problem was whether or not,
you know,

549
00:36:01.371 --> 00:36:05.180
if you're retarded and now we know that some of them,
some of them do know.
Yeah.

550
00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.630
Some of them do know.
Speaking of,

551
00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:12.230
God dammit,
this is it.
An angry,
it'll look at him.

552
00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.193
<v 0>So we,</v>

553
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:17.850
a few weeks ago I was hanging out with Matt full shrine and Mike Cronin after,

554
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:21.900
uh,
shows in Columbus and somehow we're just talking about football.

555
00:36:21.901 --> 00:36:25.980
I think it just prompted me to pull this guy out.
Fucking asshole.
Mark Davis,

556
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:31.070
the son of legendary owner and coach Al Davis of the Oakland Raiders.

557
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:35.940
He inherited about $500 million.
Wow.
And um,
that's what it looks like.

558
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:39.120
That's what he does.
And the crazy thing is,

559
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:44.420
I guess people rightfully give him shit constantly.
Yeah.
The bulk cut.
Right.

560
00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:48.220
He drives 500 square miles to get his haircut and like that five.

561
00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:52.700
<v 3>So he seeks it.
He goes to the only person 50 each way.</v>

562
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:57.730
The only person in northern California willing to give him a terrible haircut.

563
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.450
Yeah.
You know,

564
00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:02.490
one time my mother went to Allen when she was alive and ask for it.

565
00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:06.530
Vidal Sassoon Cut.
Yeah.
I want short on one side,

566
00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:11.250
long on the other.
[inaudible] and Allen let know she must've got mad.

567
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:14.850
She got furious.
A Fuck Helio mother fucker.

568
00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:18.770
What you're fucking piece of shit.
Mexican did the,
yeah,
she said that.
Yeah,

569
00:37:18.771 --> 00:37:23.390
of course.
She was out of her mind.
My mother.
And what did he say to that?

570
00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:27.290
And then you know,
he figured out she was crazy and then that was that.

571
00:37:27.291 --> 00:37:30.140
That's the last time she saw Alan and I have been seeing him for 20 years.

572
00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:31.850
But yeah.
Anyways,
that's why,

573
00:37:31.851 --> 00:37:36.851
because there's no hairdresser that should do that to you as an adult and that

574
00:37:39.141 --> 00:37:41.690
is terrible.
Oh my God.

575
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.750
This is why you shouldn't be alone.
This is why nobody should be alone.

576
00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:52.790
He doesn't have a wife.
Right.
Or a girlfriend or wife.
Bachelor.
I've gotten worse.

577
00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:57.020
Yeah.
No woman would let this.
I'm like,
get your life Mark Davis.

578
00:37:57.230 --> 00:38:00.980
You guys got to see this guy.
So Google,
Mark Davis.
Yeah,

579
00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:05.840
that's his dad right before he died.
Oh God.
Yeah.
Runs in the family,

580
00:38:05.841 --> 00:38:10.020
Huh?
Yeah.
Not a bunch of lookers.
These people.
This is a one of my favorite stuff.

581
00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:15.020
Expression.
Yeah.
A lot of people will bring up a Lloyd Christmas,

582
00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.440
you know from the,
yeah,
that's what it looks like.
It's a perfect bowl.

583
00:38:18.441 --> 00:38:20.920
This is my favorite picture though because of,

584
00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:25.850
look at the way his arm lays in his crotch.

585
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:30.440
It lays real special.
Right?
It's weird.
Yeah.
And the teeth are bad.

586
00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:32.850
He's got bad veneers.
The reason I started yeah

587
00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.590
<v 0>posting is cause I laughed so hard.
This,</v>

588
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:40.680
this guy did,
a guy did his,

589
00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:45.690
I guess Halloween costume where he got a wig.

590
00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:50.710
He got the shirt.
But the best part is he laid his hand super retarded.

591
00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:57.340
Oh my God.
That made me laugh so hard.
Yeah.
It's so weird.

592
00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.130
Now do you think,

593
00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:02.550
I think he might be slightly autistic or asked what was wrong with them?
I mean,

594
00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:06.970
first of all,
you know,
he's a team owner and he looks like,

595
00:39:06.971 --> 00:39:10.960
like I still like he won a scratch off and was like,
dude,
I got the sunglasses.

596
00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:15.530
I'm balling now.
Um,
it just looks,
he looks out of his mind.
He a,

597
00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.350
he drives a minivan still like a,

598
00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:21.700
like a 93 caravan has a flip phone.
You know,

599
00:39:21.701 --> 00:39:25.600
like probably there's some aspect of him that's like,
oh,

600
00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:30.460
I'm not,
you know,
I didn't earn being a team owner.
I think he's probably,

601
00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:34.120
that's interesting and secure about that.
That's my own theory,

602
00:39:34.121 --> 00:39:38.950
but I'm now,
the hair's definitely really bad man.
There's no question about it.

603
00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:44.500
Again,
I think this is what happens when you don't have a woman loving your life.

604
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:45.131
A woman,

605
00:39:45.131 --> 00:39:50.131
and he's a lifelong bachelor and he's probably a little socially retarded.

606
00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:54.220
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like I said,
maybe Asperger's,

607
00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:59.750
autistic or something.
And there's,
there's definitely things going on.
Jesus.

608
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:04.990
I know.
Jesus Christ.
If there's a sign,
well,
it's just the time to,

609
00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:09.140
you know what you do.
You go no more public showings no more.

610
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:12.280
This is what I look like put.
I'd be like,
no,
no dude.

611
00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:16.240
Don't have a big screen.
And we watch the game from here.

612
00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:20.920
Howard Hughes at that point you were reckless.
Why?
Like don't leave the house.

613
00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.133
Jesus Christ.

614
00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:27.400
There's a bandaid on your face that's a real fucked up man of lesions

615
00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:32.340
and the blood doesn't,
he'll know more.
Just Ron,

616
00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:35.710
I know you guys stay inside.
Okay.

617
00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:40.930
It just take me as a game.
Nobody wants to see you.

618
00:40:40.931 --> 00:40:45.670
We've got real crazy.
And his older days,
uh,
Al Davis.
Yeah.
And he used to like,

619
00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:50.560
he was an owner and coach at one point and then he would,
you know,

620
00:40:50.561 --> 00:40:54.700
he was the guy that always,
he would draft players based on measurables.

621
00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.880
In other words,
if they ran really fast in the,

622
00:40:57.881 --> 00:41:00.490
in the 40 yard dash timing and they jumped really high,

623
00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:02.530
it'd be like he'd be like draft him and they were like,

624
00:41:02.531 --> 00:41:05.920
well we think this guy's a better player,
that guys fast draft them.

625
00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:10.870
So they would just draft these like really impressive guys that are on,

626
00:41:10.871 --> 00:41:15.430
on when you look at the numbers on the measurables.
But then they would be,

627
00:41:15.431 --> 00:41:19.090
you know,
not as good of players.
And he would also,

628
00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:21.610
they said he would call down to the box,

629
00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.880
like he'd be watching the game and the owner's suite and be like,
throw the bomb.

630
00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:29.200
Like,
just go deep.
And they're like,
we got to have a really,

631
00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:34.250
a little more sophisticated,
uh,
offense to throw the bomb.

632
00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:35.840
And they're like,
all right,

633
00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:42.410
they would just run plays that he forced them to work.
No,
no,

634
00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:45.590
no.
He's like,
but I own the team.
I'll that the fuck I want.
I mean they,

635
00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:47.390
I don't blame him.
You knew that if you,

636
00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:49.850
if you were working for him that he was definitely in charge.

637
00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:53.710
There was no question that the Raiders that used to be an la team is crazy.

638
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.790
They know there's a big push for them to go to Vegas.

639
00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.550
<v 3>That's perfect.
Yeah.</v>

640
00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:01.120
That is a perfect fit for that team because the Oakland Raiders,

641
00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:02.020
the fans are terrible.

642
00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:02.670
<v 0>Well,</v>

643
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:07.670
the NFL will have to pretend to be in shock,

644
00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:09.061
uh,

645
00:42:09.061 --> 00:42:14.061
and remove them distance themselves from the reality that the NFL is gambling's

646
00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:17.530
biggest cash cow.
Oh,
you know,

647
00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:21.720
so that's the NFL is like what in Vegas is like,
yeah,
dude,

648
00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:26.280
they're going to Vegas and you have no problem with it because gambling is what

649
00:42:26.281 --> 00:42:28.980
keeps this business alive.
I mean,

650
00:42:28.981 --> 00:42:33.600
NFL is thrives on the fact that people gamble every week,

651
00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:38.040
tens of million,
hundreds of millions if not billions and billions of dollars.

652
00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:43.050
Fantasy football is all about gambling.
It's all about money.
You know,
their,

653
00:42:43.051 --> 00:42:44.940
their,
their sport is tied into money and they're like,

654
00:42:44.941 --> 00:42:47.430
we would never want it to be in Las Vegas.
Why?
Yeah.

655
00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:50.310
That's the best place in the world horse.
It is the best place,

656
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:54.790
especially for those animals who love the Raiders.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
it does.

657
00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:57.810
They're so hard for,
man.
I posted those pictures and every,

658
00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:00.510
every fourth or fifth comment was like,
fuck you bro.

659
00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:05.770
<v 3>California and their writers,
man.
Yeah.
Our intent.</v>

660
00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:08.280
It's also like the gangster team,
all gangsters,

661
00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:10.930
gang bangers who love the Raiders,
who love the record.
I want to,

662
00:43:10.931 --> 00:43:14.620
I feel like that did start in soquel because growing up here,
yeah.

663
00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:18.520
Gangbangers war,
Raider Shit and Lowe's lawyers.
Right.
Those are our two teams.

664
00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:22.150
Yeah.
And then when we lost them,
I think like the hardcore gang bangers,

665
00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:25.740
the nor cal ones took it over.
Yeah.
Let Asa,

666
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:29.350
what's the like in the prison gangs?
They,
yeah,
it's different.

667
00:43:29.351 --> 00:43:32.560
The northern California ones,
the prison gangs are different.

668
00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:35.280
<v 0>Prison gangs are totally different.
Those guys took it over.
Yeah.
They always,</v>

669
00:43:35.281 --> 00:43:38.840
black and white was always a,
uh,
you know,
that was the,

670
00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:43.040
the colors adopted by,
do you know if you were like,
oh,

671
00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:46.320
I'm a gangster.
You were black and white,
so you could wear Oakland Raiders.

672
00:43:46.321 --> 00:43:49.320
You could wear a Chicago white sox because that's black and white.

673
00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:50.370
That's what those uh,

674
00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:54.870
like Nwa guys always had radar stuff on white and stuff on,
you know.

675
00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:59.580
That's right.
Oh,
white socks,
Huh?
Yeah.
Just because,
I mean,
you know,
it's funny.

676
00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:03.720
Well it's also the white sox are on I guess,
is it south side of Chicago?

677
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:07.950
So it's a little more,
it's more hardcore.
Like the cubbies are,
are,
you know,

678
00:44:07.951 --> 00:44:09.780
more like the affluent team,
you know,

679
00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.990
like I'm down your white sox fan,
you know.
Okay.

680
00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:18.140
<v 3>Yeah.
Say what should their own times ago.
Okay.
Oh right.</v>

681
00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:23.420
But then here of course,
all the blue and red teams to yeah.

682
00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:25.620
Be careful with the blue and the red teams.
Yeah.

683
00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:29.730
Cause the crips and the blood affiliations.
Yeah.
Growing up in La,

684
00:44:29.731 --> 00:44:32.010
I couldn't wear a red or blue to

685
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.720
<v 4>junior high school public school because of the gang affiliation.
Popular colors,</v>

686
00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:38.050
really popular,
which would have been like,
you know,

687
00:44:38.051 --> 00:44:43.051
spout Orange Sienna and chartreuse shit you never wear,

688
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:47.550
I don't wear two of the most popular colors.
Stupid.

689
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.380
And British Knights.
You couldn't wear those because they were bks blood killers.

690
00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:56.190
Stupid crips wear all the time.
Yeah,
I'm blood killing.

691
00:44:56.950 --> 00:45:00.270
There's this other thing that the trainers,
the bloods do,

692
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:04.560
I guess crips do it too.
So if you're a blood,
you don't,
when you write,

693
00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:09.320
you don't use the letter c because that's considered the a blue band shaking.

694
00:45:09.321 --> 00:45:10.970
He say,
how was the crib?

695
00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:17.540
So they'll use like the letter x k or be yeah.

696
00:45:17.741 --> 00:45:22.380
Yeah.
Right,
right.
Wow.
He really hate those Kreps Huh?

697
00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:26.580
Yeah.
No,
it's how loyal are you man?

698
00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:31.950
Hello?
You are you into this nonsense to nothing that means anything.
Yeah.

699
00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:36.390
Um,
listen,
I have a correction for the last episode.

700
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:42.780
I said that my father drank 75 beers in one sitting.
That is not correct.

701
00:45:42.781 --> 00:45:46.950
I remember he told the story.
It was between he and Willie together.

702
00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:50.790
They drink 75.
Yeah.
So sorry guys.

703
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.130
My father is still an alcoholic.
Rest assured,
but just not,
how did,
um,

704
00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.660
what made you,
what prompted this?
Remember,
I was like,
wait a minute.

705
00:45:57.661 --> 00:46:01.450
Did I say that he did and I,
that's incorrect.
They,
they,

706
00:46:01.451 --> 00:46:06.330
it was he and Willie.
Now Willie,
he's dead right from that,
from that day.

707
00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:07.780
Uh,
but my father,

708
00:46:07.781 --> 00:46:12.300
your dad drank basically over 30 beers in a day.
Correct.

709
00:46:12.301 --> 00:46:15.200
Alarming.
And he's so proud of that.
Yeah.
You know?
Yeah.

710
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:19.050
That's something to be proud of.
I'd like to do an outing like that with a buddy,

711
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:24.090
you know,
go somewhere and drink a lot of beers.
Like try to try to set a record.

712
00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:29.210
Yeah.
You have a friend that you're going to tour with pretty soon?
Yeah.

713
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:32.490
I don't think I would,
I don't think it's going to do to do it on tour.

714
00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:36.210
I think it'd be a vacation thing.
You know,
like,
Hey,
there's,
there's no shows.

715
00:46:36.211 --> 00:46:40.650
Let's go do this.
How many beers can you drink?
I Dunno,
I'm not a big booze bag.

716
00:46:40.651 --> 00:46:42.760
So,
um,
you know,

717
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:47.750
I think if it's like easy light beer kind of goes down.
Uh,

718
00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:51.270
we're talking to over the course of a day.
I don't know man.
Like,

719
00:46:51.271 --> 00:46:54.030
think of your vacation,
like,
you know,
you start drinking in the morning.

720
00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:56.930
We were in Mexico.
I remember what you were saying.

721
00:46:56.931 --> 00:47:00.390
This is different though because with this thing we're talking about,

722
00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:01.860
if I'm trying to do that,

723
00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:05.520
you approach it differently than casual vacation because vacation you might

724
00:47:05.521 --> 00:47:10.290
drink a few and be like,
Oh,
you know,
put your effort toward effort towards it.

725
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:15.060
That's interesting.
They could set up something where um,
you know,

726
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:19.140
I know to a location and a date,

727
00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:22.600
we'd try to get people there and we all try to drink as many beers as we can.

728
00:47:22.601 --> 00:47:25.650
It's a really good idea.
Yeah.
And it's positive for the community.

729
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:32.980
I can't,
I can't drink more than four drinks a day.

730
00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:37.850
Tolerance.
You've never,
I've never seen you really go for it.
Get ripped.
Never.

731
00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:39.040
I just don't,
you know why?

732
00:47:39.041 --> 00:47:42.910
Cause there's a vomiting factor and I have a real fear of vomiting.

733
00:47:42.911 --> 00:47:46.210
So with liquor stop pushed it before,
but then I don't remember what happened.

734
00:47:46.211 --> 00:47:50.110
I blackout,
which I know is healthy.
So I've done that a number of times.

735
00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:54.670
I haven't seen you drunk drunk and you said you were drunk at Ellis is baptism

736
00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:57.010
party but I don't,
yeah,
but not like really,
really.

737
00:47:57.070 --> 00:48:01.960
I mean I was just like so tired that one drink had me feeling like I got fade

738
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.823
it.
Huh?

739
00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:11.610
Yeah.
No I haven't done that in awhile.
I have,
I have had uh,

740
00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:16.000
I'm trying to think of the last time or really boosted it was funny cause I was

741
00:48:16.001 --> 00:48:18.820
ripped too cause we were both so exhausted.
That was a tough week.

742
00:48:18.821 --> 00:48:21.850
And I had like one glass of wine and I was like,

743
00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:26.410
and there's pictures of us at the pictures of us when were ripped.

744
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:32.030
We're all shiny and red holding ls like my,

745
00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:36.890
my thing.
Usually once a year I overdo it with liquor,
drinks,
you know,

746
00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:40.450
liquor drink.
What do you like to drink?

747
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:45.630
What does my drink Scotch sometimes vodka soda is like my outdrink right.

748
00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:51.070
Cause it's easy goes down low sugar boy drink.
Yes.
Low Sugar.

749
00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:54.340
But those you can get in trouble with if you really,
if you keep ordering them,

750
00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:58.180
you know?
Yeah.
Cause you forgot we don't taste the alcohol after a minute.

751
00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:02.740
And then when you just realize,
oh I just write half a gallon of vodka.
Yeah.

752
00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:07.870
So the beer is way easier because much lower alcohol content.

753
00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:11.390
So I don't know man.
We should,
I should try that.
I should try.
Yeah,

754
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.610
I think you should get into this.
I think a good thinking.
I don't know.

755
00:49:15.611 --> 00:49:19.000
I'm thinking maybe you set a goal of like 20 beers and just see if I can,

756
00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.990
I think Burt can,
Oh Bert,
obviously.

757
00:49:22.991 --> 00:49:24.970
How many beers do you think Burke can drink in one day?

758
00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:27.490
If we really were trying to go for it and we're doing,

759
00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:31.350
maybe you just pick like he'll say his favorite beers.
Heineken.
Yeah,

760
00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:36.520
that's my dad's favorite team or a,
but Miller Miller lite.

761
00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:40.330
It's Kinda like sickle cell with weed.
Yeah man.

762
00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:44.140
I haven't done it in a long time with them,
but the last,

763
00:49:44.141 --> 00:49:48.840
like years ago I would go over to his house and he was like,
you wanna smoke.

764
00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:50.830
I'd be like,
no,
I'm good.
And he would roll.

765
00:49:50.831 --> 00:49:54.640
He would smoke an entire joint and tire joint of like,

766
00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:59.130
you know the good California medical shit that's done.
Light up another one.

767
00:49:59.150 --> 00:50:03.880
Then he'd be like,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Totally normal.
Fully functioning.
Let's go.

768
00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:09.310
No problem.
And I was like,
man,
if I'd smoked like a fraction of that,

769
00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:13.000
I'd be laid out on your couch right now.
You wake me up tomorrow.
Oh yeah.

770
00:50:13.001 --> 00:50:15.180
And I can't smoke in front of other people.
Yeah.

771
00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:18.190
I can only smoke pot alone now.

772
00:50:18.191 --> 00:50:21.970
It's been a minute since I've touched this stuff obviously.
But yeah,

773
00:50:21.971 --> 00:50:25.690
I don't like I get,
I get really self conscious and I don't,
I don't like it.

774
00:50:25.691 --> 00:50:28.310
I'm not the type that likes to smoke with other people.
Yeah.

775
00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:31.860
I only like it if in socially at like it in very small doses.

776
00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:34.940
I think it all comes down to tolerance.
You just have a low tolerance.
Oh yeah.

777
00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:39.500
I've always been.
So if I'm with people I want a little bit,

778
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.950
if I'm alone I can do a little more.
But then I spent a lot of time,

779
00:50:45.090 --> 00:50:48.770
uh,
yeah.
To be a better person.

780
00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:54.050
Yeah.
I know.
I start analyzing everything that's in my life and where,

781
00:50:54.051 --> 00:50:57.800
what I'm not thinking about,
I don't like it.
Oh,
I need to think that much.

782
00:50:57.801 --> 00:50:58.634
And they were married.

783
00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:04.560
<v 8>My name is [inaudible] and we will be attempting the longest cheer.</v>

784
00:51:06.091 --> 00:51:08.850
Boy is cute.
I know.
He's adorable.

785
00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:13.670
I will feel just seeing him go.
Don't get surprised.
Alright.

786
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:15.200
Okay.
Alright.

787
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:18.223
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

788
00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:30.830
<v 9>Turn that shit down.

he's attempting the longest.
You have boy ever.</v>

789
00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:34.880
I didn't know there was a thing.
Good know either.
He's winning so far.

790
00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:41.830
Yeah.
Wow.
I'm still here.

791
00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:47.340
Wow Man.
What a talent.

792
00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:54.630
<v 4>Wow.
Really proud of you.
Good job.
Good work.
And that was really good.
And yeah,</v>

793
00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:58.100
everyone's got to town.
I don't know if you actually have the record,

794
00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:02.680
but in my heart you're the longest.
Yeah,
boy.
Ever.
You know,

795
00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:07.230
you know,
um,
uh,

796
00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:10.400
we were talking about a baby names.
Yeah.

797
00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:14.990
And we decided that a really good name if we were to have a second son.
Yeah,

798
00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.090
we'll be Carl's Jr.
Yeah.

799
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:22.830
Carl's Jr Carl's jr cigarette.
Yes,

800
00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:26.150
because I,
I ate a lot of Carl's junior people ask me,

801
00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:29.810
how was your son so strong and big?
And our son is as big as the one year old,

802
00:52:29.811 --> 00:52:32.570
like a wallet,
a Carl's junior almost every week.

803
00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:37.070
And I had an extra onion rings and extra barbecue sauce and I'd park in the

804
00:52:37.071 --> 00:52:39.380
parking lot.
And that's why he's so big.
That's right.

805
00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:42.620
There was a time when I was eating western Bacon cheeseburger is twice a week.

806
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:44.810
Yeah.
And then in and out every day.

807
00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:49.580
I just love the idea and about 50 pounds people having to say the name
correctly,

808
00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:53.030
you know,
because I can picture us doing that and then people would be like,

809
00:52:53.031 --> 00:52:55.250
Carl and I'd be like,
it's Carl's Jr.

810
00:52:56.890 --> 00:53:01.040
Don't ever forget the apostrophe.
And don't forget the junior.
It's Carl's junior.

811
00:53:01.041 --> 00:53:03.380
His name is Carl's Jr.
Like the restaurant.
Yeah,

812
00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:07.010
I like the Western Bacon cheeseburger.
Yeah,
I eat a lot of them.

813
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:09.710
It's like Ruth's Chris Steak House.

814
00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:12.650
But I would like to name our son Tom's Ruth's Chris.

815
00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:17.900
There's too many possessive.
It's such a,
you can't do that.
It's so dumb.

816
00:53:18.210 --> 00:53:20.350
I remember explaining it to you because you were a little bit,

817
00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:24.130
where the fuck are we eating?
And I was like,
Ruth's Chris.
You're like,

818
00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:25.590
what do you mean by Ruth's Chris?

819
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:30.030
And so the best way to explain to people that don't know about this steakhouse,

820
00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:33.990
picture it this way.
It's Chris Steak House.
Okay.

821
00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:39.000
It's Chris is a pro.
It's no,
no,
no apostrophes.
No,
no,
no,

822
00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:42.690
no.
The wrong.
It's just called Chris Steak House.
It's okay.

823
00:53:42.691 --> 00:53:45.750
So C H R I s steakhouse.
Chris Steakhouse.
Okay.

824
00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:50.930
Ruth bought it and she wants people to know it's Ruth's Chris Steak House.

825
00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:57.270
And understand how long's the reus?
It's possessive of Ruth.

826
00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:01.710
Ruth apostrophe s Chris Steakhouse.

827
00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:04.410
Ruth's Chris Steak House.
Yeah.
Got You.
Okay.

828
00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:08.640
Now if we name our son coms Ruth's Chris.

829
00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:12.900
Oh Shit.
That'd be cool.
Tom's and then they're like,

830
00:54:12.901 --> 00:54:15.100
what's up with that dumb fucking name?
You'd be like my eyes.

831
00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:16.140
My husband loves steak.

832
00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:23.320
We ate there the week that we almost dangerous.
Tom's Ruth's Chris.
Yeah.

833
00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:28.080
Yeah,
I know.
Don't you feel like somebody should've pulled Ruth aside and like,

834
00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:32.070
Hey,
this is a dump.
Why?
Why are you doing?

835
00:54:32.071 --> 00:54:33.900
Why don't we just leave it Chris,
they,

836
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:37.130
I bet you there's just like a divorce thing.
Like,

837
00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:40.920
like Chris was the husband Chris Steak House and she's like,
it's mine now.

838
00:54:40.921 --> 00:54:44.220
Fucker and then she's like,
it's Ruth's Chris Steak House.

839
00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:48.480
Somebody looked this up and tell us.
Yeah,
I bet you that your divorce.

840
00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:49.410
I bet you too.

841
00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:54.570
Or she wanted to keep the brand of Chris Chris stick.
Now here's the thing,

842
00:54:54.571 --> 00:54:58.830
but hold on.
Hold on.
Yeah,
but Chris stakeouts,

843
00:54:59.250 --> 00:55:03.760
I don't think that's correct either.
It should be Chris's steakhouse.

844
00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:08.760
Correct.
Tony's restaurant.
There needs to be a p apostrophe.

845
00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:13.790
Chris apostrophe steakhouse house.
Don't you remember?
Dammit.

846
00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:18.220
It's Hinchcliffe cliff.
Yeah.
His Dad's was like Joe.
Joe.

847
00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:22.930
Joey restaurant.
Yeah.
Joey Italian restaurant.
Not Joey's.

848
00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:25.130
He's a pot.
Right.
That's what,

849
00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:28.410
that's what this equivalent of is Chris Steak House.
Yeah.

850
00:55:28.411 --> 00:55:32.130
It should be Chris's dude saying,
okay.

851
00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:36.180
Over four decades ago,
Ruth Fertel,

852
00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.033
Jesus Christ,

853
00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:43.100
a divorced mother to mortgaged her home for $22,000 to buy a small 60 seat

854
00:55:45.421 --> 00:55:49.140
restaurant in New Orleans named Chris Steak House.
Shortly thereafter,

855
00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:53.670
a fire forced her to change the original location and she renamed the restaurant

856
00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:57.120
Ruth Chris Steakhouse.
I told you.
Yeah,

857
00:55:58.170 --> 00:56:00.810
it's so dumb.
It's so dumb.

858
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:04.680
That adds nothing to the brand.
Nobody cares about Chris.

859
00:56:04.681 --> 00:56:08.160
They only care about Ruth.
I know.
And it's a great restaurant.

860
00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:13.260
I love me some roofs.
Oh,
it's great.
It's great.
Yeah.
Nah,

861
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:16.230
that's what gave me diarrhea yesterday is that other steakhouse.

862
00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:17.810
We would just think for lunch.
Yeah.

863
00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:20.840
And I had the cream spinach and I think that's what did me,

864
00:56:20.841 --> 00:56:24.970
and I think it had too much butter in it.
Butter gives me diarrhea sometimes.

865
00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:29.500
Um,
do you want to hear Ruth's recipe for life?
Sure.

866
00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:32.790
Insist on making a toast.
Oh,

867
00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:36.070
make big plans but live spontaneously.
Oh,

868
00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:39.730
live and dine without regret.
It's nice.

869
00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:45.690
Oh,
with Oh Ruth's.
Tom's Ruth's Chris Thomas.

870
00:56:45.691 --> 00:56:50.590

872
00:56:56.770 --> 00:57:00.190
Yeah.
After western making cheeseburger.
Your mom's favorite.

873
00:57:00.370 --> 00:57:03.730
What about waffle house?
I like the waffle house a lot.

874
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:08.380
There was a lady named Cherries Tennis Waffle?
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cherries.

875
00:57:08.381 --> 00:57:13.360
Tennis waffle.
Yeah.
What does that even mean?
Cherries.
Tennis.
Waffle waffle.

876
00:57:13.361 --> 00:57:17.710
Cherries.
Tennis.
Um,
she was arrested.
I know because,
uh,

877
00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:23.170
Harry had the world is a horrible place.
Tennis waffles.
Yeah.

878
00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:25.510
Yeah.
She was arrested.
I remember,

879
00:57:25.511 --> 00:57:28.270
cause Ryan and I were doing this pitch and look.

880
00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:35.110
Oh,
cherries,
waffles,
tennis.
Those are her student.
Jupiter,

881
00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:39.850
Jupiter.
It's a weird place until you say police safe.
Tennis was arrested.

882
00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:45.190
They wrote,
had to,
I had to write it as a regular article.
Cherries.

883
00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:49.870
Waffle tennis.
That's her name.
There's also crystal Metheny.

884
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:54.160
Oh boy.
Bees out do,
do that.
But he'd be bop,
Bop,
bop.

885
00:57:54.310 --> 00:57:56.840
I liked za but he'd be Bob.
Bob,
Bob.
That's uh,

886
00:57:56.980 --> 00:57:59.470
that's somebody that changed their name to that,
you know,

887
00:57:59.471 --> 00:58:02.740
obviously to like for attention.
But I think she might've been named Cherries.

888
00:58:02.741 --> 00:58:04.880
Waffles.
Tennis.
Yeah.

889
00:58:06.310 --> 00:58:11.290
Silly Sherry's waffles.
Tennis.
Hit in here.
Yeah.

890
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:15.610
That's good or bad.
Their three favorite things.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think it's parents,

891
00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:19.570
but then tennis is kind of a Bougie sport.
I don't know.
Too many hillbillies.

892
00:58:19.571 --> 00:58:24.300
I Like Cherries,
waffles.
And then tennis.
Mm.
What will we have named them?
Uh,

893
00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:28.840
our kid fart.
You love raspberries though?
I love raspberries.

894
00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:33.610
Raspberries,

I Dunno.
Naps football though.

896
00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:42.550
So raspberries,

Get in here.
It's pretty good.

897
00:58:42.690 --> 00:58:45.010
Roots Chris's called junior sit down.

898
00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:48.160
I still like Carl's junior and that's the dumbest name.
There you go.

899
00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:51.400
If we have another son,
Carl's Jr will be his name.

900
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:57.400
Speaking of rednecks being dumb and stuff like that,
what do you think of this?

901
00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:01.900
Neighbors along patents spur road are still well buzzing.

902
00:59:01.901 --> 00:59:05.540
Know about what happened?
Well,
I had got done fighting my chicken,

903
00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:09.420
watering them and stuff and I walked back from Ohio.

905
00:59:13.070 --> 00:59:15.980

the master of accents is always got his ears open.
Um,

910
00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:34.800

You've found an American sample?
Yeah.
Yeah.
For our,

911
00:59:34.810 --> 00:59:37.090
our friends abroad across the pond.

912
00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:41.770
This is how dumb we can be.
Yeah.
Yeah.

913
00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:47.040
<v 11>Lauren electric power fail lands have fallen and a GL cacklers Sab.

915
00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:52.500
<v 4>The jail tagger sideways into the fence did did to jail.</v>

916
00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:56.250
Tackers jail.
Attackers know the jail.

917
00:59:59.070 --> 01:00:00.600
But that's cheap.
But that doesn't sound

925
01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:21.530
<v 4>That's so dumb.
That doesn't make any sense.
Jill.</v>

926
01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:26.550
Taggers and [inaudible].
That was fucking,
that is a real person too.
Yeah.

927
01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:28.160
He didn't know it at,

928
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:32.710
but he found out that there was a hive of bees that was located there and he

929
01:00:32.711 --> 01:00:33.630
disturbed them.

930
01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:38.690
And I was a guy come up squish griming Esquire Allen [inaudible] and I'm running

931
01:00:39.811 --> 01:00:44.640
around.
Hold on by lack of speaking with,
hey,
cut out the hat.
Yeah,

932
01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:48.270

Didn't we learn that?
What that stands for?

933
01:00:48.271 --> 01:00:52.470
H h the h letter of the alphabet.
How Hitler.

934
01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:57.260
This guy's a fucking Nazi guys.
Does that surprise you?
Why like

935
01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:02.370
a,
uh,
it looks like a Nascar Hat,
right?
That's what I thought it was.
Oh,

936
01:01:02.371 --> 01:01:05.210
you don't think it's a Heil Hitler.
Oh,
let's see.
Does anybody drive with a,

937
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:08.520
is anyone sponsored by Hitler on the Nascar Circuit?

938
01:01:08.770 --> 01:01:13.770
And we know how to ask maybe Dany Mac knows I'm NASCAR driver.

939
01:01:15.181 --> 01:01:19.440
Let's see.
Yeah.
Earnhardt Jr.
Oh,

He's a Nazi.
Yeah.
The eight,

Street yarn.

941
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:26.100
Heart should know better than that.

how lucky that you're,
that's not your dad.

945
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:43.610
My Daddy.

Sometimes like I'm just so glad radiate.
Hey,

946
01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:47.670
how I held her down.
Yeah,

947
01:01:47.671 --> 01:01:52.410

You of course.
It's a few people's dad.

948
01:01:52.790 --> 01:01:56.280
Yeah.
Yep.
Oh,

949
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:59.590
I want to own up there and he found out,
well,

950
01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:03.630
you filed by a half of bees there.
Bleed.
Disturb them.

951
01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:10.710
Wow.
Wow.
No one talks like that.
Super.

952
01:02:10.711 --> 01:02:15.360
It's like a Disney.
Are you in a squabbling?
He has dip in his mouth too.

953
01:02:15.361 --> 01:02:19.730
Yeah.
Permanently.
Yeah.
Surgically implanted.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And uh,

954
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:23.000
how ruining your ring,

955
01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:26.090
cut out leaky down.
Bang,
don't brine.

956
01:02:27.090 --> 01:02:29.850
It's embarrassing.
Did says they ran up the road,

957
01:02:29.851 --> 01:02:34.320
grabbed a hose outside his home and started trying to spray off the bees.

958
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:36.450
I told him I need to get out of water,

959
01:02:36.451 --> 01:02:40.560
but I didn't know is getting eat up by age.
I thought we'd just high what?

960
01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:44.630
I understand what he said.
Oh right.

961
01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:49.260
It's crazy that this guy lives in our country.
Yeah.
And talks like this.
I know.

962
01:02:49.410 --> 01:02:53.220
It's fucking insane.
It's MD Anderson didn't says they ran up the road,

963
01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.770
grabbed the hose outside his home in stock.

964
01:02:55.830 --> 01:03:00.510
So the people that were covered in bees grab this whole trying to spray off the

965
01:03:00.511 --> 01:03:04.290
bees.
I told them I need to get out of water.
So I told him,

966
01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:07.220
you need to get out of that one.
I didn't know he's getting eat up a age,

967
01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:11.580
but he didn't know that the guy was getting eight,
eight,
eight,

968
01:03:11.581 --> 01:03:14.310
eight up with bees.
Stung by bees.

969
01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:18.110
My Butt ate up with bays at Ruth's Chris steak hat.

970
01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:24.210
Carl's Jr get over here.
Oh,
he just ha ha.
I thought it was just Ha.
Oh,
okay.

971
01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:27.840
So he thought they were acting a fool,
right,
because they were just really high.

972
01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:31.380
Gotcha.
You understand that he wasn't aware of the bee problem?
Yeah.

973
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:33.303
<v 12>Yup.
Exactly.</v>

974
01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:36.880
<v 4>Deputies say the couple were under the influence of drugs.</v>

975
01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.760
They say they had driven,
they were hacked.
They were.
Ha.

976
01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:44.030
Most people are that live in these areas.
What else are you going to do?

977
01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:45.960
[inaudible] got no hope.
They were high.

978
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:50.560
The road looking for a place to swim at narrowing a little McCain and Jesus

979
01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:55.510
Christ.
I thought,
Oh,
here.
I'm sorry
it got that one.

980
01:03:55.511 --> 01:03:58.900
I definitely don't know.
And you can see whatever it is in his mouth.

981
01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:03.280
Look at that again.
Looking for a place to swim in your own little bikini.
Yeah.

982
01:04:03.370 --> 01:04:07.890
She had her red dots.
Oh,
here.
Do you understand that?
Yeah.

983
01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:12.320
The girl in that Bikini Red Bikini,
she's knitting a scarf at an answer.

984
01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:18.160
That was pretty good.
That's pretty good.

985
01:04:19.090 --> 01:04:19.923
<v 12>Yup.</v>

986
01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.520
<v 4>Looking for a place to go.
Looking for a place to swim.</v>

987
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:27.110
I've known that little bikini.
She had a little red dot.
Oh,
here.

988
01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:33.060
She had little red dots all over.
There you go.
Oh Wow.
Look at you.

989
01:04:33.130 --> 01:04:37.870
Blue bands,
the hillbilly whisper.
How did you understand that?
Yup.
That's it.

990
01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:41.490
You speak fluent hillbilly.
I've known him a little bikini.
First language.

991
01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:45.630
She yellow red dot though.
Oh,
here.
Yeah,
she had girl and that little bikini.

992
01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:50.610
She had little red dots all over.
Yeah.
Wow.

993
01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:52.350
You could,
um,
you should move there.

994
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:57.840
Fit Right at the FBI.
Would red hair.

995
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:03.040
I ain't never seen.
No one would have got him before.
God.

996
01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:07.580
Do you think they're tolerant of Jewish people?
No.
Right for this.

997
01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:12.920
I think it's probably in America it's probably the last pocket of nonsensical.

998
01:05:15.090 --> 01:05:18.160
You don't see like a,
I mean,
in La,
you know,
this

999
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:22.600
<v 0>is a Jewish city,
so you don't really see that.
But I mean you,
when you hear it,</v>

1000
01:05:22.601 --> 01:05:24.910
you're like,
what are you talking about?
But I think deep,

1001
01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:29.670
deep southern really biblical places are probably the last project.

1002
01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:32.910
<v 3>Jew.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
Probably because they,</v>

1003
01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:35.680
it's like one of those things where they're,
they're never around it.

1004
01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:38.740
Even when I would do the south,

1005
01:05:38.830 --> 01:05:43.760
they would see my last name on the marquee and I was an outsider.
Yeah,
for sure.

1006
01:05:43.761 --> 01:05:47.680
I know I'm like a white blonde.
Oh No,
I'm a big outsider.
Yeah.
No,

1007
01:05:47.681 --> 01:05:51.160
I don't look out.
I don't think you see it a lot higher.
Crown was a foreign.
Okay.

1008
01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:59.200
Yep.
Wow.
Uh,
uh,

1009
01:05:59.201 --> 01:06:01.330
of all that could have been your dad,
like,

1010
01:06:01.331 --> 01:06:04.720
do you just think of the probability of your life,
the,
the,
the,

1011
01:06:04.721 --> 01:06:09.310
the fortitude that you were born with your parents and I know not in like some

1012
01:06:09.311 --> 01:06:11.770
horrible country.
When you think about it,
you're like,

1013
01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:20.460
turn that down.
But that was the whole toy.
Horrible.
Alright.
Bring back duct tape.

1014
01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:27.120
Duct tape.
Duct tape dad right there.
That's how he saw that.

1015
01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:32.360
I'm sorry.
Yeah,
that's for duct tapes from,
yeah.

1016
01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:38.510
So good.
So good.
Oh Wow.
I don't know.
Um,

1017
01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:42.620
<v 0>so I like to bar.
I liked the part.
Yeah.</v>

1018
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:47.550
<v 3>Okay ma'am.
That's kind of the song I've been working on.
I like to fight.</v>

1019
01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:52.000
I like to fight.
I've been singing my song more to Ellis.

1020
01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:57.040
Mommy,
Mommy.
Mommy is the best
daddy.
Daddy,

1021
01:06:57.041 --> 01:07:01.750
daddy doesn't care about you.
Not Cool at all.
He loves it.
Yeah.

1022
01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:07.360
Anyways.
Um,
here we go.
Or is it,
here we go.
Mommy.

1023
01:07:07.361 --> 01:07:10.750
Mommy.
Mommy.
Yeah.
Yup.

1024
01:07:20.170 --> 01:07:21.003
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1025
01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:28.270
Did it in junk,
gentle,
gentle update.

1026
01:07:29.290 --> 01:07:33.850
<v 3>Oh Man.
I gotta go.
I gotta go to,
what are we doing this?
Okay,</v>

1027
01:07:33.851 --> 01:07:38.230
let's find a new dentist and the neighborhood.
Yeah.
And go get our teeth cleaned.

1028
01:07:39.010 --> 01:07:43.190
Maybe we should go towards the new,
yeah,
my health,

1029
01:07:44.530 --> 01:07:47.440
my old Hungarian dentist was,
oh,
I remember I neighborhood.

1030
01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:52.240
He's retired now though.
He's retarded.
He's
retired.

1031
01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:57.160
He shouldn't be working on,
I think it's pretty advanced.
Uh,
dearest mommy's,

1032
01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:58.090
I used to cringe

1033
01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:00.970
<v 0>or fast forward when you did dental updates.</v>

1034
01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:03.940
I knew I had been neglecting my choppers.
Why?

1035
01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:08.530
It had been at least eight years had been to the dentist or life.

1036
01:08:08.730 --> 01:08:11.410
I had no dental insurance and frankly,
I was poor.

1037
01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:15.200
I had begun to smile less because I knew my teachers.

1038
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:18.620
We're looking less than awesome as terrible years of smoking,

1039
01:08:18.650 --> 01:08:22.820
which I quit four months ago.
Congratulations.
Coffee and no flossing.

1040
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:26.240
All of the signs of bad tooth ownership.

1041
01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:29.360
I'm coming up on my wedding and a few weeks.
Oh.

1042
01:08:29.361 --> 01:08:33.980
Mortified at the idea of having to do anything at a tiny smile for all the

1043
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:38.580
fucking pictures that will be taken.
Yeah.
I made the appointment.
Yes.

1044
01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:42.620
Five days before my wedding.
Oh,
what if there are issues.

1045
01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:46.430
The Nice lady took note of the nuptials and when they got a cancellation,

1046
01:08:46.431 --> 01:08:47.264
she called me.

1047
01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:50.600
I had my appointment today and what did the email my mommy's and let them know

1048
01:08:50.601 --> 01:08:52.090
the results.
Yeah,

1049
01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:54.830
<v 3>no cavities.
Wow.</v>

1050
01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:56.000
<v 0>But a few very,</v>

1051
01:08:56.001 --> 01:09:00.260
very minor issues from my hard brushing habit and lack of flushing,

1052
01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:03.770
flushing,
flossing.
Everyone in the office was Super Nice.

1053
01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:07.700
No one made me feel bad about not being to the dentist.
They all wanted to help.

1054
01:09:07.730 --> 01:09:11.270
We have a plan for the future.
I will forever be a patient at this office.

1055
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:14.210
Just wrote them a thank you card and put it in the mail.

1056
01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:17.810
I will not stop smiling and looking at my sparkly teeth.

1057
01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.420
Good for going to feel great about myself.

1058
01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:24.920
The day I marry the man of my dreams and it will show in my smile.

1059
01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:28.160
You guys pushed me to do this.
I thank you.

1060
01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:33.470
Always going to floss from now on.
I promise the Kate the hygienist.

1061
01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.570
Thanks Eric.

1062
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:38.570
<v 3>All right.
Nine graduations.
Good for you.</v>

1063
01:09:38.571 --> 01:09:41.780
And you see how that works is that he says I have no money.

1064
01:09:41.781 --> 01:09:45.980
This is a man writing this.
Sorry.
Yeah.
Okay.
And,
and they,
they worked out a plan.

1065
01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:51.170
Yeah.
Payment plan.
So guys,
don't let money deter you from fixing your teeth.

1066
01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:54.870
<v 0>They'll always have more.
Um,
you know,</v>

1067
01:09:54.871 --> 01:09:56.880
empathy for you when you go in person.

1068
01:09:57.390 --> 01:09:59.560
<v 3>Oh,
funny.
What's worse?
Because there are people too.</v>

1069
01:09:59.890 --> 01:10:03.990
And the thing is don't think you need dental insurance.
Tom and I don't have it.

1070
01:10:03.991 --> 01:10:07.120
I haven't had,
I had it once in my life and that's when I got ripped off.

1071
01:10:07.121 --> 01:10:11.290
Remember the dentist told me I had about 20 cavities.
Tom,
if you recall,

1072
01:10:11.291 --> 01:10:16.000
that happened to me and I don't have dental insurance anymore because of that.

1073
01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.073
True.

1074
01:10:17.490 --> 01:10:20.730
<v 0>Yeah.
Oh,
by the way that they even pay.</v>

1075
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:23.860
<v 3>He's distracting.
What do you mean?</v>

1076
01:10:24.250 --> 01:10:27.130
I said that it happened to me when I had dental insurance.

1077
01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:31.960
They told me I had like 20 cavities.
Yeah.
And then I,
you know,

1078
01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:36.010
I canceled it happened to me.
Yeah,
I know.

1079
01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:38.710
Now you're admitting that it did happen to me.

1080
01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:40.300
You claim that it didn't happen to me.

1081
01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:45.130
That what happened to you did I went to a dentist with dental insurance and they

1082
01:10:45.131 --> 01:10:48.040
said that I had 20 cavities.
Did it?
I know,
I know.

1083
01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:52.510
<v 0>You always take my stories and make them yours.
But um,
there was another thing.</v>

1084
01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:55.060
Oh,
you did this to,
you did it.
You did the other,
you did it the other day.

1085
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:57.400
It took something that happened to me and you're like,
oh.

1086
01:10:57.590 --> 01:11:01.790
<v 3>But to me,
uh,
it was for the first,</v>

1087
01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:07.070
<v 0>Oh my God,
for the first three months that our son was alive.
Yeah.</v>

1088
01:11:07.150 --> 01:11:11.710
And every time I would burp him,
I would burp.
And you'd go,

1089
01:11:11.711 --> 01:11:14.250
Jesus,
why are you burping ever?
You're like,
it's so,

1090
01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:18.240
<v 4>I don't understand if,
if you're burping him,
why you have to Burp.</v>

1091
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:21.480
And then you go,
hey,
you know what?
Every time I burp Alyse,
I have to Burp.

1092
01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:25.170
And I go,
I know you gave me shit for this.

1093
01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:30.600
You don't have no recollection.
You said to me every day and you're like,

1094
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:33.180
nope,
never,
no,
no recollection.
Anyways.

1095
01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.440
A lot of the dentist did that to me and I burp when he grips.

1096
01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:40.290
So I have no recollection of the first three months of his life.

1097
01:11:40.291 --> 01:11:45.270
And you don't remember me telling you the dental story of of,

1098
01:11:45.450 --> 01:11:47.590
but that did happen to me to ask my friend,
Eric,

1099
01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:49.140
do you remember me telling you that that happened?

1100
01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:54.550
And I remember who it happened with.
The TV,
TV friendly dentist.
Yeah.

1101
01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:58.590
See,
I do remember yours.
And then the same thing happened to me in sperm bank,

1102
01:11:58.591 --> 01:12:02.880
California when I had dental insurance for,
from an employer I had.
Okay.

1103
01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:06.960
I swear I don't,
I don't,
you know,
I know that you live,
but the thing is,

1104
01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:09.151
by the way,

1105
01:12:09.151 --> 01:12:13.110
I still floss despite these ridiculous stories that flossing doesn't help.

1106
01:12:13.111 --> 01:12:17.940
And didn't you tell me the other day how philosophy does help that it breaks up

1107
01:12:17.970 --> 01:12:20.910
bacteria?
No,
you told me clusters of it,
right?

1108
01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:25.300
Somebody told you that it wasn't me that told you.
Okay.
Yeah,

1109
01:12:25.710 --> 01:12:30.660
I remember the brain.
Mommy,
nine guys.
It's real.
It's real.
Oh,

1110
01:12:30.661 --> 01:12:33.510
by the way,
I'm talking about the poop pile.

1111
01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:38.040
There's no bull shit with your pupae and email that came in about the poop pile.

1112
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.671
Hey,
Mommy's,

1113
01:12:38.671 --> 01:12:43.230
I was listening to the powerful Jre Joe Rogan Episode Two oh seven when I heard

1114
01:12:43.231 --> 01:12:48.231
something Amaz Joe steps away briefly around one 1845 while he was gone.

1115
01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:52.830
Red Band tells you guys he has a new game for you.

1116
01:12:53.150 --> 01:12:57.030
He was game to see how long can go before flushing the toilet.
Mommy,

1117
01:12:57.031 --> 01:12:58.560
Tina is not on board,

1118
01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:01.530
but the water champion mentions he already did something like this in college

1119
01:13:01.531 --> 01:13:05.580
and it was called by.
Since Tom had no reason to lie at the time.

1120
01:13:05.610 --> 01:13:09.330
I believe this is massive evidence that he has been truthful the whole time.

1121
01:13:09.930 --> 01:13:14.620
Giving the Yorkie sippers already married track record FedEx,
and look,
Roy,

1122
01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:19.950
I think it's easy to see that the poop pile did indeed exist.
Tyler,

1123
01:13:19.951 --> 01:13:24.951
thank you for your message and you will be receiving a prize anyway,

1124
01:13:25.530 --> 01:13:30.240
by the way,
the poop pile is different than not flushing the toilet.
Yeah,

1125
01:13:30.930 --> 01:13:33.600
okay.
The Poo piles at varsity level,

1126
01:13:33.601 --> 01:13:37.770
not flushing and an outdoor pile that you claim people pooped on it.

1127
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:41.460
It wasn't a non fleshing.
Do you remember?
We don't flush a lot in this house.

1128
01:13:41.461 --> 01:13:46.440
One that's yellow.
We leave it mellow.
Yeah.
Each other's yellow sun sometimes.

1129
01:13:46.441 --> 01:13:47.880
Yeah.
Especially at nighttime.

1130
01:13:47.881 --> 01:13:51.630
Yellow you got to flush that every time it's a waste of water.

1131
01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:56.080
The water and sound it going just yellow,
yellow,
yellow,

1132
01:13:57.210 --> 01:13:59.660
yellow.
7:00 AM you flushed it?
That's my answer.

1133
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:03.120
Cause there might be four or five yellows in there.
If you remember.

1134
01:14:03.121 --> 01:14:06.510
We played the,
uh,
I've been yelling a lot at night.

1135
01:14:07.670 --> 01:14:10.710
I think I have to stop drinking water a couple hours before bedtime.

1136
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.980
I would never do

1137
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:16.900
<v 3>anything like that.
So,
but I hydrate so much throughout the day,</v>

1138
01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:24.720
but I pee all night because I'm hydrating so frequently.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1139
01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:28.030
When you get used to the high consumption like me,
you'll get past it.

1140
01:14:28.210 --> 01:14:32.650
I want you to note,
yeah.
I had some eggs removed from me.
What,

1141
01:14:32.890 --> 01:14:35.550
what we talked about this.
Okay.
Okay.

1142
01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:40.470
So I had some eggs.
Frozen embryos frozen.
Yes.

1143
01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.790
Just in case we want kids later.
Anyways,

1144
01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:48.360
they told me that I can't drink water from 8:00 PM the night before the surgery.

1145
01:14:49.150 --> 01:14:51.220
Yeah.
Until the next day.
Yeah.

1146
01:14:52.150 --> 01:14:55.610
I thought for sure that would really be a thing for me.
Yeah.

1147
01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:58.360
But because I'm so hydrated,
it didn't even bother me.

1148
01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:01.180
Oh actually the doctor pulled me aside and told me that you were super died.

1149
01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:04.730
That's a lie.
Yeah,
that's true.
Remember when you had your blood taken?
Yeah.

1150
01:15:04.731 --> 01:15:07.780
And she's like,
I can't find a vein cause you're so dehydrated.

1151
01:15:07.781 --> 01:15:11.230
Your blood was thinking coagulated.
Find a van cause you're so fat.

1152
01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:14.530
It's not that all the fat is covering it now.
She goes,

1153
01:15:14.531 --> 01:15:17.710
your blood is like chocolate syrup.
Why is that bullshit?

1154
01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:18.910
Cause you're not hydrated.

1155
01:15:18.970 --> 01:15:22.330
<v 0>Bullshit.
You remember we watched that I'm Dennis Rodman thing.
We talked about,</v>

1156
01:15:22.331 --> 01:15:26.850
hey broke his dick.
Yeah.
Blah blah,
blah,
blah.
Says Ah.
Yeah.

1157
01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:31.070
So yes.
So

1158
01:15:31.630 --> 01:15:34.930
<v 3>I love him so much.
You know,
I have a lot of empathy for that guy.</v>

1159
01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:39.280
I think he's a good man at his core.
He's just,
he's fucked up.
He's got,

1160
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.680
yeah,
sweet guy though.

1161
01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:46.350
<v 0>So here's a listener who I believe says they broke their deck,
right.
Oh,</v>

1162
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:50.520
get their mommies having been there.
Uh,

1163
01:15:50.521 --> 01:15:54.510
excited cowgirl.
We'll see up road to high,

1164
01:15:54.511 --> 01:15:58.570
quickly slammed down.
Oof.
Oof.
Sounded serious.

1165
01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:00.090
Like a cherry bomb exploded.

1166
01:16:01.710 --> 01:16:05.670
That's the two main blood vessels that in gorge for an erection.
Oh,

1167
01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:08.700
each one on east side of the main vein that pipes,

1168
01:16:08.701 --> 01:16:13.260
the swimmers that once a folded over can abruptly snap.
And my essence,

1169
01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.550
oh my butthole twin.

1170
01:16:15.930 --> 01:16:20.930
The blood float internally creating a big dark purple hog sausage and emergency

1171
01:16:21.691 --> 01:16:25.890
surgery pronto.
Fuck five days of morphine and,

1172
01:16:26.030 --> 01:16:29.370
and in the hospital,
Jesus as an aside,

1173
01:16:29.371 --> 01:16:31.680
having happened in San Francisco back in College,

1174
01:16:31.681 --> 01:16:34.830
going to SF general emergency means you're in a teaching hospital.

1175
01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:36.590
<v 3>Ah,
yeah,
that's right.
It's a matter</v>

1176
01:16:36.710 --> 01:16:39.530
<v 0>gold.
So they're similar to Rodman's third break.</v>

1177
01:16:39.531 --> 01:16:44.531
They hold so many fucking doctor in Hertz through to see the anomaly of a broken

1178
01:16:45.291 --> 01:16:48.140
dick.
It became a field trip of,

1179
01:16:48.141 --> 01:16:52.520
so here we have something you probably won't see again showcase of my dick with

1180
01:16:52.521 --> 01:16:56.810
a catheter in it.
Inside of a plastic tower of protection.

1181
01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:58.190
Awkward.

1182
01:16:58.190 --> 01:17:03.190
Too absurd to nonchalant to local legend in the inner circle of friends get well

1183
01:17:03.951 --> 01:17:06.450
cards from grandparents were a little awkward also.
Oh,
oh

1184
01:17:06.450 --> 01:17:10.080
<v 3>wow.
I love y'all Seattle Fan.
Wow.</v>

1185
01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:13.740
<v 4>Oh,
oh yeah.
It's really loud.
It was like a big boat.
Neck broke one day,</v>

1186
01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:17.660
like three times.
Yeah,
I mean from him.
I actually know that thinking about it,

1187
01:17:17.661 --> 01:17:20.700
I think I kind of believe it,
you know?
Oh No,
it's real.
No,

1188
01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:23.180
I believe it happened to him three times I'm saying.
Oh absolutely.

1189
01:17:23.181 --> 01:17:25.850
Especially when you're whacked out on drugs or whatever.

1190
01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:29.900
Hanging out with lunatics,
man.
Hanging out with friends.

1191
01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:35.160
No losers.
Fucking loser.
Yeah,
yeah,

1192
01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:40.120
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1193
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:46.190
How great was it to hear your dad laughing at blonde jokes by the way?

1194
01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:50.840
And that,
you know,
we gotta do we,

1195
01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:53.810
it's got to be a regular you guys,

1196
01:17:53.811 --> 01:17:58.811
we need to just email us your blonde jokes and you're Polack jokes and then

1197
01:17:59.061 --> 01:18:03.750
we'll just tell them to him.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1198
01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:07.820
It's so great listening to him laugh at the dumbest jokes ever.

1199
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:10.040
I called him by the way,
right after that call.

1200
01:18:10.210 --> 01:18:14.450
Cause remember when I go at how many people you kill,
he was like,
oh three I go,

1201
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:17.860
what was that like?
And he's like,
I don't want it to,
I go,
dude.
I said,
you know,

1202
01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:19.280
I'd never would try to,

1203
01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:20.933
<v 0>you know,</v>

1204
01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:26.160
make you feel badly about that or put you on the spot about that.
I said,

1205
01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:30.330
you've talked about it publicly before.
Yeah,
because he,
we've had on the show.

1206
01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:34.080
<v 4>Yeah.
It looks like sexual experience.
Yeah.</v>

1207
01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:36.730
<v 0>And he goes,
oh I know.
He goes,</v>

1208
01:18:36.731 --> 01:18:39.850
it's just how that question question hits you in the moment.

1209
01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:44.050
So I just wanted to share that with listeners that I called him immediately and

1210
01:18:44.051 --> 01:18:44.501
he goes,

1211
01:18:44.501 --> 01:18:48.550
you know that question just in the moment you might not want to discuss it.

1212
01:18:48.551 --> 01:18:50.260
Which I think makes sense.

1213
01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:52.840
<v 4>Of course are sometimes you don't want to talk about certain subjects.</v>

1214
01:18:52.841 --> 01:18:56.920
And then immediately we talked about it for about 30 minutes and it wasn't

1215
01:18:56.921 --> 01:19:00.760
recorded,
which suck.
No,
it wasn't recording.
He was like,
there's no thrill.

1216
01:19:00.761 --> 01:19:03.660
Like I was like,
all right,
we're back on board.
So

1217
01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:10.290
thank God.
Get on the enemy.
So fun.

1218
01:19:11.230 --> 01:19:14.830
It was south right away.
He was just like,
there's just nothing like it.
He goes,

1219
01:19:14.831 --> 01:19:18.250
one time I had was marine great Marine College Texas

1220
01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:22.270
<v 0>and I said,
uh yeah,
if you could,
uh,</v>

1221
01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:27.540
if you could kill the enemy or get a piece of pussy,
what would you,

1222
01:19:27.630 --> 01:19:31.540
<v 4>you father said this to me and I in the guys weird kill the enemy.
He was like,</v>

1223
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:35.110
that's what I like to hear.
Your great fucking marine.
And it was Tommy.

1224
01:19:35.150 --> 01:19:39.680
We were trying to kill.
They are,
I know they love it.
Marines love that stuff.

1225
01:19:39.790 --> 01:19:44.030
Love that as a personality type that that's,
that's what they do.

1226
01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:46.370
Good and thank.
Thank God for the Marines.

1227
01:19:46.371 --> 01:19:49.670
If you're wired that way people for a good cause.

1228
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:54.750
<v 0>You were thinking about the fact that your dad vacations where my dad was in war</v>

1229
01:19:56.010 --> 01:20:00.010
<v 4>and my dad was a great,
I love is so fucking hot.</v>

1230
01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:01.870
I told him on that cargo younger,

1231
01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:06.790
his dad just got back a month in Vietnam.
It was Jesus Christ.

1232
01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:09.030
<v 0>I go,</v>

1233
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:12.030
we were just talking about what it would take for you to go there for a month.

1234
01:20:12.650 --> 01:20:15.300
That's not happening.
Not Happening.
He's like,
I hate that place.

1235
01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:18.920
Of course you were in war.
There I go.
I'm,

1236
01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:21.330
I'm thinking about getting you a gift and maybe taking you there.

1237
01:20:21.331 --> 01:20:24.700
Like we can go Tommy Jane doe the day I,

1238
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:28.580
we plane banked out,
it was looking over the side yard.

1239
01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:31.170
I was like Matt never see this fucking place again.

1240
01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:37.540
<v 3>Well I imagine his experience was,
it's a little different than,
you know,</v>

1241
01:20:37.630 --> 01:20:40.840
a club med in Danang or a dude.

1242
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:45.190
Every time I bring it up I get new stories.
It's actually pretty fascinating.

1243
01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:48.640
I wish I could hear them.
I really wish you would.
Fascinating more stories.

1244
01:20:48.641 --> 01:20:52.150
I mean yeah,
tell me them though.
Yeah.
Cause their shit that you're like,

1245
01:20:52.151 --> 01:20:55.080
oh I think I've heard all the stories and then 40 minutes.
Yeah.
Shit,

1246
01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:59.470
I've never heard it cause he kind of sheltered you from the stories for many

1247
01:20:59.470 --> 01:20:59.850
years.

1248
01:20:59.850 --> 01:21:01.950
<v 0>Time,
long time through that I brought,</v>

1249
01:21:01.951 --> 01:21:05.240
I brought up to him that when I was a kid as to,
cause you know,

1250
01:21:05.250 --> 01:21:07.860
I didn't curse for a long time as a kid.

1251
01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:11.170
<v 3>You guys didn't swear at your house.
Yeah.</v>

1252
01:21:11.190 --> 01:21:14.660
You're that kind of family that never dropped the F bomb?
No.
What about,

1253
01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:19.000
what about Shit could you say?
Well there's a certain age for all those things.

1254
01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:21.940
So like I would hear shit

1255
01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.110
<v 0>dammit.
But you know,</v>

1256
01:21:24.111 --> 01:21:27.680
shit was like as far as it went in the house and my mom,

1257
01:21:27.681 --> 01:21:32.570
even when Chet Chet,
that was probably like that,
you know,

1258
01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:35.150
actually that was like,
that was them forever.
I mean,

1259
01:21:35.151 --> 01:21:39.860
my mom never said anything worse than Shit.
My Dad,

1260
01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:41.900
first time I heard him say fuck,

1261
01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:44.990
I was in high school at some and I was like probably high school,

1262
01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:49.370
maybe a junior when I heard him say it like an accident,
like oh fuck.

1263
01:21:49.371 --> 01:21:52.700
And I was like,
whoa.
I had never heard by that time I was already saying it,

1264
01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:56.000
but I had never heard him say it as a kid.

1265
01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:01.520
Probably a first time I started cursing regularly was probably not until middle

1266
01:22:01.521 --> 01:22:04.340
school,
maybe seventh,
eighth grade or something.
You know,

1267
01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:06.140
like when you've kind of boys being boys.

1268
01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:11.180
But before that I didn't curse and one time and I thought that was just like

1269
01:22:11.181 --> 01:22:15.290
such a crazy thing to say the f word.
Right.
And I asked her,
I go,

1270
01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:19.700
did you ever say the f word?
And I said,
no.
Have you ever said the f word?

1271
01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:23.710
And I was like nine years old and I still remember him going one time

1272
01:22:26.350 --> 01:22:31.350
I go when he goes in Vietnam and I was like,

1273
01:22:32.330 --> 01:22:36.560
Oh,
I reminded him that he was like,
oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1274
01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:41.060
He doesn't remember that of course.
But I remembered clearly and I was like,

1275
01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:45.650
it must've been really bad.
And then I go,
can I go?
Yeah,

1276
01:22:45.651 --> 01:22:46.760
you just like really high.
And he goes,

1277
01:22:46.761 --> 01:22:49.070
I know it's a regular part of my fucking vocabulary.

1278
01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:52.740
<v 3>Any CSOS about a lot and pussy with you now.
And like,</v>

1279
01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.670
cause I've kind of watched this evolution of your relationship because when you

1280
01:22:56.671 --> 01:23:00.030
and I started dating,
you were 20 what?

1281
01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:02.350
You were 25 five.
Yeah.

1282
01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:06.910
And he was still kind of putting the parental yeah,
image on with you.

1283
01:23:07.090 --> 01:23:09.010
And then I remember one time you were like,
Dude,

1284
01:23:09.011 --> 01:23:12.130
my dad just talked about like in full Bush.
Yeah.

1285
01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:16.500
And that was a few years later that he likes full Bush and,

1286
01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:18.460
and I think of the whole thing is,

1287
01:23:18.461 --> 01:23:21.340
you know how you don't see your parents as people for a long time.
Yeah,
for sure.

1288
01:23:21.370 --> 01:23:24.730
And then over time I realized like this dude's a total savage,
you know,

1289
01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:30.040
and I mean,
he's the best guy,
but he's a savage.
So it's all like,
yeah.
He's like,

1290
01:23:30.670 --> 01:23:35.020
remember we did the blonde joke and he goes,
fucking broad stump Raj.

1291
01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:39.910
He can see a dumb broad doing that.
I love it so much.
It's such an old school,

1292
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.600
like,
oh,
and I'll,
you know what?
And I kind of,

1293
01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:49.540
but I respect that and I kind of noticed that so much because at the end of the

1294
01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:49.541
day,

1295
01:23:49.541 --> 01:23:54.541
like your dad obviously has two daughters and a wife and he loves them to death,

1296
01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:58.420
treats them well.
And you know what I mean?
I just,
I dunno,

1297
01:23:58.570 --> 01:24:02.380
it feels familiar to me.
I like,
here's my dad right here.
He just sent me this.

1298
01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:06.730
<v 14>Oh my God.</v>

1299
01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:15.620
<v 3>Yeah.
Sounds a different Dick.
Can I read you a text message of from my dad?
Yeah.</v>

1300
01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:19.040
He came back from Vietnam.
Yeah.
This weekend.
Yeah.

1301
01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:23.840
My father finally returned.
Um,
hold on.
Finally,

1302
01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:26.030
final return from Vietnam after being gone for like a month.

1303
01:24:26.031 --> 01:24:30.570
And in the course of him being gone,
I mean we baptized our son.
Yeah.

1304
01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:34.970
We're an escrow on a house and I had my embryos frozen.

1305
01:24:34.971 --> 01:24:38.390
Like those are the three major big things.
Life things.

1306
01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:40.370
He didn't ask about any of it,

1307
01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:44.000
like the whole conversation about him.

1308
01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:47.650
And then in the last few seconds I had to like interject and be like,
well,

1309
01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:50.840
oh by the way,
are you know Ellis is growing teeth yet?
Yeah.

1310
01:24:50.841 --> 01:24:54.650
Ellis has two teeth now and where we bought a house and this or that.
Anyway,

1311
01:24:54.651 --> 01:24:59.120
so I'm telling him the location,
you know,
and he goes,
oh.

1312
01:24:59.121 --> 01:25:01.250
And then he's texting me,
you know,

1313
01:25:01.251 --> 01:25:05.210
make sure you get everything fixed before you move in.
Beautiful House.

1314
01:25:05.650 --> 01:25:08.780
Now you're going to be happy there and it's our neighborhood where you grew up.

1315
01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:11.990
And I go,
yeah,
no shit.
Like in my head,
I'm like,
yeah,
of course asshole.

1316
01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:14.330
I remember where I grew up.
He goes,

1317
01:25:14.331 --> 01:25:18.800
well Ellis is going to grow up there now and the liquor store is close,

1318
01:25:18.801 --> 01:25:22.040
the one at this,
you know,
this cross street of Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah.

1319
01:25:22.041 --> 01:25:27.041
Remember that's the one fun memory my father has at this neighborhood.

1320
01:25:27.951 --> 01:25:32.210
We're moving to remember the liquor store that we went to and I was like Yeah

1321
01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:35.660
Dad,
remember that liquor store?
Yeah.
Like that's a nostalgic moment.

1322
01:25:35.661 --> 01:25:39.410
That's the sweet memory.
Yeah.
My childhood because I used to go there a lot.

1323
01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:42.550
I wasn't a every day.
Yep.
Yep.

1324
01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:44.540
That's where we would pick up a six or right.

1325
01:25:44.570 --> 01:25:49.030
That's right after work we go in and he gets to the 600 to 12 or whatever it is.

1326
01:25:49.150 --> 01:25:53.570
That's all I remember when you thought that that was just a normal thing.
Yes.

1327
01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:59.160
You're like that's not every character that 12 pack 12 or every day after day.

1328
01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:04.070
He picked me up from school and his,
um,
in his van he had a,
he was

1329
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:05.710
<v 4>a mechanic and a,</v>

1330
01:26:05.711 --> 01:26:09.440
I was so embarrassed by that van cause it was greasy and stinky,
you know,
like,

1331
01:26:09.441 --> 01:26:14.270
uh,
some mechanics.
I mean,
not everyone,
but I'm like you,

1332
01:26:14.271 --> 01:26:15.530
I was so embarrassed with certain people.

1333
01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:18.590
I know certain era when they would dress certain ways,
I was like,

1334
01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:24.280
oh my God,
cool sweater.
Well my dad dress called,

1335
01:26:24.281 --> 01:26:27.020
but when he would show up in his mechanics uniform sometimes and it'd be like

1336
01:26:27.021 --> 01:26:30.430
Gracie,
and I'm like,
oh my God,
we're mechanics uniform.
I'm like,

1337
01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:31.310
I'm so embarrassed.

1338
01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:34.730
But that was rare and he'd just come from the shop to come get me,
you know.

1339
01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:38.380
But otherwise,
my dad always dress cool.
He's cool.
Yeah.
He's,
you know,

1340
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:42.230
you're all cool.
He's like that Italian guy,
but you know,
not that gay.

1341
01:26:42.290 --> 01:26:47.290
My parents showed up to see us in high school or Middle School,

1342
01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:53.000
the same way you would show up to see a,
uh,
a kindergartener.

1343
01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:57.800
The words like,
my dad would come and be like,
hey buddy.
And I was like,
Hey man,

1344
01:26:57.830 --> 01:27:02.000
I'm 15.
And you dial it down a little bit.

1345
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:09.140
Super enthusiastic.
And I was like,
yeah,

1346
01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:14.090
he still is like that same way today,
Christina.
It's different now.

1347
01:27:14.091 --> 01:27:17.030
Now you're like,
oh,
okay.
It's like I'm doing now.

1348
01:27:17.031 --> 01:27:19.910
But Tommy was such a cute little shit still.
So

1349
01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:26.210
tell me just the cutest little boy,
Christina,
and he could puke on me.

1350
01:27:26.211 --> 01:27:30.950
Shit on me.
I didn't care.
Yup.
Gear.
This little boy.
Aww Shit.
Tommy was a kid.

1351
01:27:30.951 --> 01:27:34.270
It's a Harry is right here.
There's my dad.

1352
01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:40.640
Uh,
so weird.
He sounds different.
When you record,
it was back in high school.

1353
01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:44.330
What was the Lamest,
your dad,

1354
01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:49.400
what was his worst era of fashion or as he always worn the uniform of khaki.

1355
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:54.360
Buttoned down.
No,
no.
My Dad is a conformist.
He is.

1356
01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:59.100
He liked people to follow the rules.
Cut your hair,

1357
01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:03.580
cut your hair hippy,
put on different shirt.
He would like.

1358
01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:05.840
He's never really critical.
Not Critical Dad,

1359
01:28:05.841 --> 01:28:08.690
but he was just looking at me and be like,
no genes can't work.

1360
01:28:08.691 --> 01:28:13.580
Jesus all right.
Yeah,
a collared shirt.

1361
01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:17.300
That's how he wants you to look.
You know I want,
I used to have scruff,

1362
01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:21.020
not a beer,
but a scruffy scruffy then like that and share that.

1363
01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:24.980
But your father's fashion I'm saying didn't change with the Times.
Right.

1364
01:28:24.981 --> 01:28:29.930
I'm assuming he always wore like a polo shirt,
a button down Khakis,

1365
01:28:30.290 --> 01:28:31.080
a belt.

1366
01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:36.080
He doesn't own t shirts like working out tee shirt but not like I'm gonna work t

1367
01:28:36.881 --> 01:28:41.240
shirt to just go.
I don't think I've ever seen,
no,
he doesn't own it.

1368
01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:45.110
Even when they came to visit us in La a while,
like a month ago,
I was like,

1369
01:28:45.111 --> 01:28:48.200
do you want to stop by the hotel and change into something more comfortable?

1370
01:28:48.201 --> 01:28:51.680
And he goes,
I am comfortable.
Always didn't even dress loafers,

1371
01:28:51.681 --> 01:28:56.570
you know like those ones.
Jeez.
He's the only worn tennis shoes,
you know,

1372
01:28:56.571 --> 01:29:00.470
like I say per workout or if or if like he goes to me like a long walking day.

1373
01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:04.590
He might wear some then,
but no,
will he wear shorts?

1374
01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:07.650
Like khaki shorts are still long pants?
No,

1375
01:29:07.651 --> 01:29:11.460
he worked khaki shorts in the,
in the,
yeah.
Yeah.

1376
01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:16.110
But pretty much,
and a button down,
if it's auto,
probably let's say a polo

1377
01:29:17.810 --> 01:29:22.710
on a cruise.
It's harder.
Yeah,
for sure.
Probably some neat higher socks,
you know,

1378
01:29:22.850 --> 01:29:26.440
hindsight.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1379
01:29:27.150 --> 01:29:31.860
Did he ever have hair?
No.
No.
I mean,
and the,
no,

1380
01:29:31.890 --> 01:29:34.050
he didn't ever have here.
I mean,
he had hair,

1381
01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:37.770
he had the last remnants of it when they,
when he was getting married.

1382
01:29:37.771 --> 01:29:42.720
So I don't remember how old was he when they got married at 30.
Wow.

1383
01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:46.810
Yeah.
So he had a comb over then,
you know.
Yeah,
yeah.

1384
01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:52.080
Everybody was doing that in the 70s to flip it over it camouflage and say,

1385
01:29:54.101 --> 01:29:55.200
you can't tell somebody.

1386
01:29:55.201 --> 01:29:59.610
I used to always get mad when I was in high school and even college that he was

1387
01:29:59.611 --> 01:30:01.290
clearly bald,
you know,
he had the horseshoe,

1388
01:30:01.710 --> 01:30:03.810
but all these hairs on top and then I go,

1389
01:30:03.811 --> 01:30:07.680
why don't you just clean that for a clean look?
Because I think it looks better.

1390
01:30:07.710 --> 01:30:10.740
Like if you're,
you just clean the top.
And he was like,
no,
I don't do that.

1391
01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:15.450
And I used to always be like,
dude,
it'll look Tommy.
I like it.

1392
01:30:16.930 --> 01:30:17.763
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1393
01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:20.370
<v 4>And he called him his survivors.
You know,</v>

1394
01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:24.820
cause it's like a hundred hairs.
You go just clean that up.

1395
01:30:24.821 --> 01:30:27.400
It'll look and now I think he does it.
Yeah.

1396
01:30:27.401 --> 01:30:32.401
Now he does because I've seen this him chicken hair on top 25 years.

1397
01:30:32.590 --> 01:30:37.420
Wow.
You go along with that plan.
It doesn't like it.
Such a creature of habit.

1398
01:30:37.450 --> 01:30:37.990
I know,

1399
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:42.730
it's funny cause I remember when he was here and then he sat on our recliner and

1400
01:30:42.731 --> 01:30:47.731
he had his caffeine free sugar free Diet Coke because Dad's can't have fun

1401
01:30:47.861 --> 01:30:51.460
anymore.
You can't drink anything fun,
none that tastes good.

1402
01:30:51.490 --> 01:30:54.170
And he was just in heaven watching CNN.
I know.

1403
01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:59.170
Flip side is your dad shows up in like tracksuits and shit,
you know,

1404
01:30:59.650 --> 01:31:04.550
light orange tinted shades and the hair is the others.
He's back.

1405
01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:08.100
He's like,
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1406
01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:13.450
Oh let it sit.
That's what he wore at my wedding and linen white suit,

1407
01:31:14.290 --> 01:31:17.710
gangster shit.
Super Eastern,
blocky.

1408
01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:21.990
My favorite is when I was about to go down the aisle with him and I had,

1409
01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:23.380
why ain't know my wedding dress?

1410
01:31:23.381 --> 01:31:27.010
And here you are at the front of the church and it's going to be the one of the

1411
01:31:27.011 --> 01:31:31.390
biggest moments of my life and I turned to him and I was like,
Oh my God,
Dad,

1412
01:31:31.391 --> 01:31:35.860
I hope I don't cry.
And he was like,
lab.
Would you cry?
Like,
okay.

1413
01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:40.360
All right.
Jeffrey Dahmer like no feelings.
I cry.
I was crying.

1414
01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:44.280
We both were crying and so emotional.
It's so dumb.

1415
01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:46.270
We're going to have sex with anyone.

1416
01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:49.910
<v 1>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
There you go.</v>

1417
01:31:51.770 --> 01:31:52.603
Anyways,

1418
01:31:52.850 --> 01:31:57.080
<v 4>our dogs are getting groomed.
Rumor has it.
Rumor has it.</v>

1419
01:31:57.110 --> 01:32:00.070
They're going to be so cute when I love when come back.
I hate when they put

1420
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:02.410
<v 3>all those gay bows on your dog though.
Yeah,
I know.</v>

1421
01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:07.330
Can I take this shit off of the poor dog?
Lead my dog on.
Leave the dog alone.

1422
01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:11.890
A mass hole.
This lady is pretty fantastic.

1423
01:32:11.891 --> 01:32:16.880
Don't put bows.
She's yelling at this guy on a train.
That stuff.

1424
01:32:17.150 --> 01:32:17.983
<v 15>Yeah.</v>

He was rubbing his balls.
Yeah.

1432
01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:11.340
You need a woman like that to straighten his ass.
