18
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.730
It's not true.
Yeah,

Who Lies?
Well,

21
00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:45.210

Babe.
Okay,

22
00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:47.590

Okay.

24
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.150
How do we find people?
It's the internet speed.

25
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.810
How are we going to find their names?
I don't remember the year,

26
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.400

28
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.820
Yeah,
but you look older than me and you act older than me.

29
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.600
I do look older and I'm much more mature.
But that's not true.
Yes it is.

30
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.520
You're not more mature.
Yes.
You're a child.

Don't go into,

31
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:23.100

I'm so much more mature than you know.
You're nuts.

How was that new club?
It's beautiful.
Yeah,
it is beautiful.

38
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.960
It's why better than a Kentucky Fort that was,
uh,

39
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.520
that was a goddamn shit dog shit pile.
And that was a poop pile.
Bad luck.

40
00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:02.230
It wasn't my favorite.
It wasn't my fate.
And attracted the riff Raff.

41
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.310
Lot of drunks.
It was really rough back of the animals in that area.

42
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.770
People vomit and that show room a few times on me.

43
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:11.200
I had a tweaker run up to the stage.
So if you want to,

44
00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:14.650
if you're trying to get your act to dumbed down,
do some spots,

45
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.810
it would happen through the shows and all of a sudden you're like a final show.

46
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:22.330
You're like,

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.020
I helped build up my calculator probably.
Yeah.
No,
that'd be fine.

142
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.170
She should definitely.
Yeah.

143
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.220
And then let her hang like the lights in the backyard too.
Yeah,
absolutely.

144
00:10:50.221 --> 00:10:54.970
Do everything.
Let's just make her do her errands or working in downstairs.
Um,

145
00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.050
<v 5>hey,
what's up everyone?</v>

146
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.340
Today I'm going to talk about just steroids.

147
00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:07.140
Make your balls straight.
The answer is yes,
they do.

148
00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:13.710
Let me throw this at you.
Is that really a bad fucking thing?

149
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.500
Don't bring anyone love loving to this.

150
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:24.720
<v 1>Well,
welcome
to your mom,
so I'll shoot,</v>

151
00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.500
shoot,
shoot.
Christina,

152
00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:14.390
<v 4>are you shaking your head?
I know what's going on.</v>

153
00:12:14.391 --> 00:12:17.420
You know what it is.
It's later in the day.
Then we'll usually tape.

154
00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.440
You're a little tired.

155
00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.370
Have some brown diarrhea and this will make you feel better.
You're,

156
00:12:23.371 --> 00:12:26.420
you're used to drinking this instead of water.
Anyways,
so

157
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.670
fucking water champion.
He sabotaged me.

158
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.860
I brought up that bottle water and then you cleaned it like it was yours.
Meyer,

159
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:39.970
you were going downstairs.
I asked you to bring water please.

160
00:12:39.971 --> 00:12:44.300
He couldn't carry everything in my hands,
but if you are such a water person,

161
00:12:44.301 --> 00:12:48.060
you would already have taken care of your own needs.
What are you talking of?

162
00:12:48.061 --> 00:12:51.620
Water.
Well,
you wouldn't pass.
Pass it off on me.
I can't ask you to bring water.

163
00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.710
Not if you're a water champ.
You should just have it up here.
Oh my God.

164
00:12:54.711 --> 00:12:59.660
You're such a jerk to that.
Tom,
can we please talk about,

165
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:03.260
we'll get into this guy.
I think it's amazing.
It's got,
it looks good.

166
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.910
This is a natural,
natural.

167
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.880
The Sun was in the health.

168
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:14.090
She's someone's way in the house.

169
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:18.380
But you don't think it's amazing when you came home yesterday from your trip and

170
00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:23.300
I smelled your beard and I guess what you had for dinner the night before cause

171
00:13:23.301 --> 00:13:27.410
I hadn't showered since cause that went from show to the hotel and I had an

172
00:13:27.411 --> 00:13:29.840
early flight.
Right.
And you're like,

173
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.310
you put your nose in my beard and you go,
he had meat,

174
00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.460
you know last night I did.
Yeah.
Yeah.

175
00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:42.620
That was so cool that it stays trapped that long.
I would think that it was like,

176
00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.230
you know,
a few hours,
right.

177
00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:51.010
It stayed in there for 1516 hours and you flew and you woke up and you ate other

178
00:13:52.251 --> 00:13:56.710
garbage.
Probably had Bojangles in the airport.
I didn't have Bojangles.

179
00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.440
You don't like to get that?
No.
Before you fly six in the morning.

180
00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.251
I don't ever like,

181
00:14:01.251 --> 00:14:06.251
as much as I am somebody that will eat definitely garbage sometimes I never do

182
00:14:06.921 --> 00:14:09.800
the morning like Mcdonald's.

183
00:14:09.801 --> 00:14:13.500
Like when you see people just lined up at 5:00 AM,
you know,

184
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.340
who's doing night pretty bland or if anything,

185
00:14:16.341 --> 00:14:20.510
I'll go to one of the airport restaurants for breakfast so you can get an actual

186
00:14:20.511 --> 00:14:23.630
a cooked breakfast but not you can't do.

187
00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.650
And the real salvage are the people that bring the bags of fast food on the

188
00:14:27.651 --> 00:14:32.390
flight.
You fucking asshole on the 7:00 AM you could smell fast food.
You're like,

189
00:14:32.391 --> 00:14:34.540
dude,
you're going to eat that on this flight.
Oh,

190
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:39.010
I smells like farts to cause it's an egg sandwich.
Planes.
Toxic parts.
Yeah.

191
00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.560
And I realize why is it something that sounded good?
Like you know those,

192
00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:46.970
she's the Hash browns.
I like fire.
I want those,
you know?

193
00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:52.260
Anyway,
I thought that was just a real testament to my talent as a beard.
Yeller

194
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.220
<v 2>that I could tell you what you had for dinner the night before.</v>

195
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:56.720
It was impressive.
I'll give you that.
Yeah,

196
00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:59.180
maybe that I hate you in a lot of ways,
but if that was impressive.

197
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:06.190
<v 7>Okay.</v>

198
00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:08.140
<v 2>Yeah.
People are really listening right now.</v>

199
00:15:08.141 --> 00:15:11.860
I don't realize that they missed a burb that you did because it's cut out of the

200
00:15:11.861 --> 00:15:14.600
show now,
but when you burp during our Goddamn ads,

201
00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.610
I have to cut it out and um,
I,
I'm sorry.

202
00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.050
Does that make you feel better?
A little bit.
Yeah.
That one is,
it's a good point.

203
00:15:22.051 --> 00:15:25.150
It is.
Here's what needs to happen.
You need to have a nap today.

204
00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.990
You need to eat nice things and he needs your balls melt because you're a little

205
00:15:28.991 --> 00:15:30.970
intense and it's cause your balls are full.

206
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.110
<v 7>Yeah,
it's true.</v>

207
00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:39.670
<v 2>You're all fired up because we haven't done it yet.
You just got home.</v>

208
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:41.890
I had to go to the lady doctor this morning,

209
00:15:41.891 --> 00:15:46.210
so we bang it out yesterday and now you're all backed up and you're angry as

210
00:15:46.211 --> 00:15:47.044
fuck.
And I know

211
00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:54.700
that make you feel better.
Sure.
I like you more.
Okay.
Yeah.
I love you Tom,

212
00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:57.910
that I'd be to want to talk to me about one of those.
See the steroid guy?
Yeah.

213
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.060
I haven't seen all of these yet.
I want to see what he talks about.

214
00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:04.540
Is it such a bad thing that you're bothered?
That's a great idea.

215
00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:09.820
It is something I'd never considered.
Does it suck to have your,

216
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:14.930
does it suck to have your balls shrink?
I don't know.
I know he,
it's kind of,

217
00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.930
you've never actually heard that,
are you?
I've never heard that.

218
00:16:16.931 --> 00:16:19.150
Ever heard of that or like what's so wrong with that?
Yeah.

219
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.910
<v 8>Visually and aesthetic,</v>

220
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.860
which are the same thing I'm looking at.

221
00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:31.450
Would you prefer to see hang lower than the ball or fucking ball and you're

222
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:39.070
lower than the day dipping lower than the balls.
Look at that voice.

223
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.120
<v 2>Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
Her wanna see her really.</v>

224
00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.390
Her Dick hangs lower than her balls.
You look at her and you're like,
okay.

225
00:16:46.391 --> 00:16:50.560
And she goes,
yeah,
hang lower than the ball.
The balls.
Wow.

226
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:55.410
Because you see,
uh,
for our listeners,
yeah.
Cause uh,
you know,
a woman with a,

227
00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:59.230
with a lot of cleavage showing clearly into fitness as well.

228
00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:02.980
And she got them hard titties.
Like when the,
when the days my daddy's no more,

229
00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:05.020
it's just hard.
Basel got the packs.

230
00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:10.210
He has completely unnatural this dude.
It looks like somebody drew him,

231
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:14.200
you know,
like it's crazy.
It's like a sketch of a muscular person.

232
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.390
It's comical.
It's ridiculous.
So she,
well,
how do you feel about that question?

233
00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:24.610
Uh,
I,
I mean,
I don't,
I think it's okay.
Like on either end,

234
00:17:24.611 --> 00:17:28.900
it's too extreme.
If it's gotta be one or the other.
If the balls are too small,

235
00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.790
because I don't,
I don't know.
What about his question?

236
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:34.750
Would you rather see balls hang lower than the deck or a deck hang lower than

237
00:17:34.751 --> 00:17:39.520
the balls?
Nothing.
I've thought about,
think about it.
Now.
I don't give a fuck.

238
00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.730
Is that enough of an answer?
Like,
yeah,
that's a legit answer.
No.
Why?

239
00:17:42.731 --> 00:17:46.780
Because they all come in different shapes and flavors and sizes.
Flavors.

240
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.880
I care more about the taste.
Right.

241
00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:57.210
<v 4>You're worse.
Jesus.
Well,
because when men get older,</v>

242
00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:02.130
don't the nuts kinda hang lower than the dick even seeing balls hang lower than

243
00:18:02.131 --> 00:18:06.790
the deck for the last 11 years.
But I was saying is when you're aligned and,
yeah,

244
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.600
see I don't play,
I don't think about that.

245
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.300
When you watch on your online on red too,

246
00:18:12.301 --> 00:18:15.990
when you're googling like you don't see the out there.
Um,

247
00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.000
what do you mean you don't see it?

248
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.350
That cause they're usually inside of somebody like,
I don't know,

249
00:18:19.351 --> 00:18:22.680
but it starts out like when they,
they do the UNZIP,
right?
And the girl's like,

250
00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:26.910
Ooh.
And he's like,
yeah,
bitch.
Yeah.
Like that part,
those big,

251
00:18:26.911 --> 00:18:29.640
all the thongs hang below the balls.
Right.
See,

252
00:18:29.641 --> 00:18:32.910
I don't notice that to me balls or like an afterthought.
They're really for,

253
00:18:32.911 --> 00:18:35.790
at least for me,
they're just not part of the primary.

254
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:40.590
They're just in the background dude.
Like I don't even consider them really well.

255
00:18:40.591 --> 00:18:43.170
I would say that I've seen you consider mine,

256
00:18:43.171 --> 00:18:46.770
so I feel like you're not being totally honest.
Transfer were married.

257
00:18:46.771 --> 00:18:49.450
I don't do that for everybody.
Jesus,

258
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:54.390
you don't have,
somebody was asking me to describe you.
I'd say,

259
00:18:54.391 --> 00:18:55.380
well she's a ball of fishing.

260
00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:01.030
You consider the balls when you're married because that's,
but you're always like

261
00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.930
game because we're married and I got to keep it interesting.

262
00:19:06.931 --> 00:19:10.680
But for every other guy that I'd been with,
who cares.
Right.

263
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:11.950
I don't next clip here.
Right.

264
00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:15.740
<v 8>Oh,
of course you would rather see it dig,
hang lower than the balls.</v>

265
00:19:15.741 --> 00:19:20.741
Now some guys are blessed and that big fucking Dicks and some guys are fun and

266
00:19:21.831 --> 00:19:23.240
have little motherfucking days.

267
00:19:23.241 --> 00:19:28.241
So the guys that have balls and hitting down lower than their day,

268
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:31.520
I would think they wouldn't want their fucking balls to shrink.

269
00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:34.360
<v 4>This guy's a genius.
Yeah,
this guy is pretty cool.</v>

270
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:40.300
Then you know what I love too and I really saw my balls to shrink to hold on.

271
00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:44.980
I love these guys that are super aggressive,
like whatever.
It takes like the,

272
00:19:44.981 --> 00:19:48.340
it's so dumb.
Like really whatever it takes.
Huh?

273
00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:51.310
What's a real gym rat attitude is about.
It's about like,

274
00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:55.230
I work out all fucking day.
I get it.
Yeah.
Sorry.
So what did,

275
00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.540
what did you just say though?
I'm sorry.
I um,
I dunno what I just said.

276
00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.260
Hey Dick and the,
he said it baby.
I didn't say it,

277
00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.440
but you said you're not sure if you want the Dick to be no,

278
00:20:05.441 --> 00:20:09.970
I said I don't want my balls to shrink.
Yeah,
I think it's not healthy.
No.

279
00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:13.320
Why would I want them to shrink?
I think it's not good for you.
I think it,

280
00:20:13.321 --> 00:20:16.490
it doesn't it decrease your,
uh,
your testosterone?
No.

281
00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.870
What happened was decreased burden to have such a,

282
00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:25.320
I think a jump in testosterone that your body's natural testosterone output

283
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:29.860
decreases,
right?
Because you're pumping yourself with unnatural amounts.

284
00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:34.090
Your natural production of testosterone goes like,

285
00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:38.570
oh this is way too much inside of me.
Goes down.
So you test these drink too.

286
00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.610
That's terrible.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean look,
that's a,
you know,

287
00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.730
price you pay for looking for,

288
00:20:45.731 --> 00:20:50.150
looking at totally and like looking so awesome and perfect like this Guy Jesus.

289
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.920
Cause this isn't heavily the veins and the chest and the shoulders.

290
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:57.520
To me personally,
and this is just me personally,
this never looks,

291
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.380
it doesn't look good.
This guy is in a lot of pain though.
You can tell.

292
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:07.300
I mean of course this is the same as seeing like a 500 pound person.
You know,

293
00:21:07.301 --> 00:21:10.090
you go like,
oh that person's in a lot of pain.
Of course.
Yeah.
I mean,

294
00:21:10.091 --> 00:21:14.530
and you can tell why a lot too.
Like the voice is a voice of pain.
Yeah.

295
00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.990
Danny Bonaduce.
Yeah.
Hard living.
The,
he's got the jet black.
No,

296
00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.720
unnatural hair is hair.
Um,
yeah,

297
00:21:22.721 --> 00:21:27.490
like the tattoos that are just running all over that like nothing about this guy

298
00:21:27.491 --> 00:21:29.160
is balanced.
No,

299
00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:34.550
<v 8>because honestly having a balls hanging down below your Dick is not the best</v>

300
00:21:34.741 --> 00:21:38.460
look and it only makes your dick look even smaller than it is.

301
00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:43.050
So you just heard it from a hot girl and I give her a ticket.

302
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:46.200
Every fucking girl out there was going to say the same fucking thing.

303
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:49.110
They'd rather see the tick hang lower than the balls.
Now,

304
00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:53.480
<v 4>here's what I do love about this guy.
Everybody in this world,</v>

305
00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.760
you always make you,

306
00:21:55.890 --> 00:22:00.060
you have to live with your situation and you have to make your situation right

307
00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:04.130
in your mind,
at least acceptable does that.
Or you end up hating everything.

308
00:22:04.131 --> 00:22:05.750
Right.
You hate yourself.
This guy,

309
00:22:05.751 --> 00:22:10.370
obviously he hates that his balls or shrunk really small,

310
00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:15.020
but he's right.
He's telling the story of no.
Awesome.
Yeah.

311
00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.020
He's seen her at the gym.
Look at the way she looks at him with like pity.

312
00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:21.650
You could see it in her face,
like it's like a troubled,

313
00:22:21.651 --> 00:22:24.370
Kevin's got probably and he,
yeah,
of course.
And he was like,
what?

314
00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:29.210
I say would you want the cock or the balls small?
And she's like,
okay,

315
00:22:29.211 --> 00:22:33.560
the Dick Hanging.
And now it's like his,

316
00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.670
his story that he wants to believe he's putting it out there.

317
00:22:37.671 --> 00:22:40.630
He doesn't believe what he's even selling.
Yeah,
I agree.

318
00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:45.790
He's working by making every fucking girl out there once small balls like no,

319
00:22:47.421 --> 00:22:52.300
they don't do,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I can't,

320
00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.410
you know,
now that I do think about it,

321
00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:59.420
I think a nice pair of big slobbers like go nuts.

322
00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:02.300
It's a sign of male virility.

323
00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:06.440
You want a guy with low hangers with low hanging fruit because that means he's

324
00:23:06.441 --> 00:23:10.740
been around.
He can,
he's fertile.
Yeah,

325
00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.120
he's pumped loads.
That's what you want.
And you love that ball slab.

326
00:23:14.121 --> 00:23:16.300
You're always like,
slap those balls against behind.
Right?

327
00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.920
Yeah.
I forgot about that part.

328
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:27.950
You're always like gimme that boss.
Huh?
Have I said that before?

329
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:35.870
Yeah.
Cause he got a tiny little marbles.
You can't do that.
He can't do that.

330
00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:40.700
I got a big Ole hangers on me.
Do you know God didn't give me a real great Koc.

331
00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.630
They gave me the balls to make up for it.
That's true.

332
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:50.070
That's not true now.
But Your Dad's got,
oh my God,
we got to see my dad's balls.

333
00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.460
A Guy,
you know,
but I want you to actually hold them this time.

334
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:57.830
Do you think you'd let me know?
But I think if I was like,

335
00:23:57.831 --> 00:24:00.440
you've got to show Kristen in your roles.
He'd be like telling me,
okay.
Yeah,

336
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:04.730
I think so too.
He would show me.
We could not tell your mom no,

337
00:24:04.731 --> 00:24:07.070
but I would want him to bend over so you could see him from behind.

338
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:10.640
That's the angle.
Have you seen him from behind?
Because I've seen them change.

339
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.570
You know,
it's like I've been in the room when he's like

340
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.180
putting on underwear and I'm like,
oh my God.

341
00:24:17.181 --> 00:24:21.050
He's like worst few things like what are you doing?
I'm like,
look at your balls.

342
00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:25.940
Balls hangs so low.
Very few men look good from that angle.
By the way,

343
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:30.970
even if you're super fit like a even a really fit guy bent over and you see the

344
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:34.790
balls hanging,
it's,
we'll talk about them when they're,
when they come.

345
00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:36.950
It's not sex.
Hopefully we'll do a segment on his balls.

346
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.310
What does your mother feel has we don't want to get into,

347
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:44.130
that'll be a new thing because I think what we can try to do is just speaking to

348
00:24:44.131 --> 00:24:46.880
them for half an hour or just talking about farts.

349
00:24:46.881 --> 00:24:49.190
Shits and balls to really loses her mind

350
00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:56.690
really,
really has a low tolerance.
Very low.

351
00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:01.520
She'll stay on the line a little longer if I'm in the room.
Yeah,

352
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.370
like cause then shawl but I'm going to put them right here.

353
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:08.530
I think that's the way to do it.
She's going to hold scout base

354
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:11.023
<v 9>please.</v>

355
00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:21.850
<v 8>Maybe 20 to 30</v>

356
00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:26.910
<v 4>Scott.
He's so 80% at.</v>

357
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:28.343
Can I tell you though?

358
00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:32.240
It would be more weird to me to see a man with tiny shrunken nuts,

359
00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:36.770
horse and nice hangers.
Then,
you know,
you could tell you,
so it was like,
look,

360
00:25:36.771 --> 00:25:39.860
you can work out here for a month for free if you just do my cock and ball
video,

361
00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:44.930
because it's clearly she's coached into saying whatever.

362
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:48.400
She just takes pity.
I think that is a pity because he faced.

363
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:52.700
Do you know anybody that likes small ball?
The big balls?
No.
Oh,

364
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:56.300
I've talked to girls with anything like balls.
Yeah.
I mean,

365
00:25:56.690 --> 00:26:00.000
I'm sure there's the room.
Other phase.
Don't drag balls.
Drag.

366
00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.720
Who's been telling you that?
Couple chicks.
I know

367
00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:05.103
<v 9>couple of girls.
I know</v>

368
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:08.830
<v 4>what girls.
You don't know any girls beside your sisters?</v>

369
00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.670
I'm sure she'd be like,
it's like,
I mean,
I fucking love all of it.

370
00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:15.880
Like that whole thing.

371
00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:20.050
She animal

372
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:25.900
love balls.
I don't mind balls.
I,

373
00:26:25.901 --> 00:26:29.740
it's just neither here nor there.
It's a nonissue for me.

374
00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:35.590
It's like I'm on the salad.
Right,
right,
right.
Who Cares?

375
00:26:35.591 --> 00:26:37.780
I can eat salad with or without the crew time.

376
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:47.220
<v 8>20 to 30% is probably a good fucking thing.
In fact,</v>

377
00:26:47.221 --> 00:26:50.130
not probably.
It is a good fucking thing.

378
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:54.700
The higher your balls are,
the bigger your fucking Dick Looks.

379
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.820
<v 10>I'm really into this.
He's really selling it,</v>

380
00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:01.080
but there's guys out there that are like,
Yep,
I'm on board.
My board anyway,
Dave,

381
00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:04.560
look back.
But they have to,
if you're a,
for the Jews had liked this,

382
00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:07.920
you got to start being like,
hey,
it's a good thing of,
you know,

383
00:27:07.921 --> 00:27:10.620
you're finding the process.
Find The rain.
Yeah.

384
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:15.920
Life gives you lemons and you got a get fucked up on the weekends.

385
00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:16.813
Yeah.

386
00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.500
<v 8>Well,
I'm just telling you I chill.
Shit.</v>

387
00:27:19.501 --> 00:27:24.501
How the fuck it is and my opinion is I would rather have my balls shrink 20 to

388
00:27:25.141 --> 00:27:30.141
30% and my balls have shrunk 20 to 30% so my dick looks even bigger solo.

389
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.530
What the fuck is the problem here?
Right.

390
00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:42.950
<v 10>That was the best laugh I've ever heard.
Right?</v>

391
00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:47.990
<v 8>Oh,
the problem here?</v>

392
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:52.770
<v 10>Yeah.
Oh</v>

393
00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:57.830
boy.
What's the 5%

394
00:27:57.970 --> 00:27:59.080
<v 8>the problem here?</v>

395
00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:05.860
<v 10>God,
I'm going fucking take this guy and she doesn't want to be in the video.</v>

396
00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:09.310
Yeah.
She's like,
uh,
are you trying to get me?
Because I feel like there's also,

397
00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:13.750
he asked her to do this video to see if like talking about his dick and balls.

398
00:28:13.751 --> 00:28:18.570
We did entice her.
Maybe she's like,
yeah,
she's like a nice girl.
That works then.

399
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:21.380
Yeah.
She's like the front desk girl checks people in.
Yeah.

400
00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.620
But she works out for free there.
Yeah.
And he's like,

401
00:28:23.621 --> 00:28:27.730
you want to see this deck and balls.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's old as fuck too by the way.

402
00:28:27.731 --> 00:28:32.410
For him.
Yeah.
What's that?
Uh,
nothing.
Just checking.

403
00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.770
Avails.
Coming in.
Avails.

404
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.903
<v 9>Okay.</v>

405
00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:39.410
<v 10>So,
um,</v>

406
00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:43.450
<v 2>so we uh,
went for breakfast this morning.
Yeah.</v>

407
00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:48.220
And which is nice cause we haven't seen each other in days.

408
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:53.750
I know days and my wanted to catch up with you when hear about Cincinnati and we

409
00:28:53.891 --> 00:28:54.701
got our meals,

410
00:28:54.701 --> 00:28:59.200
we had our breakfast and then you ate yours in about 30 seconds.

411
00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.990
And then I ate mine at a normal human pace.

412
00:29:01.991 --> 00:29:06.760
So I'm halfway through mine and you're done eating and you're like,

413
00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:08.290
ah,
I gotta go to the bathroom,

414
00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:13.990
which is what you do to me 90% of the time.
So half a plate of food.

415
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:17.680
And now I'm sitting at the fucking restaurant all alone,

416
00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:23.100
eating my breakfast while you take a shit at the restaurant for 10 15 minutes

417
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:29.200
and you,
by the way,
you didn't tell me you had to shit.
He would just like,

418
00:29:29.201 --> 00:29:29.840
I gotta go

419
00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.080
<v 10>as the bathroom.
All right.
Yeah.
That's what happened.</v>

420
00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.233
<v 9>That's what happens.</v>

421
00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.513
<v 10>What's wrong with that?</v>

422
00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:40.570
Because it takes the fun out of going to a restaurant and we were almost done.

423
00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:41.980
No,
we weren't

424
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.870
<v 2>almost halfway done with my meal.
We're more than halfway done.
I was nine.</v>

425
00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:49.210
I needed someone to sit there and talk to me.

426
00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:54.050
<v 10>No,
you were.
You were more than halfway done,
right?
What are you doing?</v>

427
00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:58.410
I'm doing something.
She says,
this is what I get asked every time

428
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:02.890
<v 2>because we're doing a show.
It's for a reason.
Obviously it's for the show.
Okay.</v>

429
00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:07.840
Jesus.
What is it?
A Special Collin?
You can keep talking,

430
00:30:07.841 --> 00:30:11.470
Babe.
Oh my God,
but you're the only person that I'm supposed to be talking.

431
00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.120
I can still handle the conversation with you.

432
00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:19.310
<v 10>God,
I can still do this.
This is our marriage.
20 years from now,</v>

433
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:21.180
I add white male.

434
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:25.850
I wasn't fucking gone that,
first of all,

435
00:30:25.851 --> 00:30:30.290
I was gone two minutes and you make it a big deal.
It wasn't two minutes,

436
00:30:30.291 --> 00:30:33.170
so it was like 15 no,
it wasn't

437
00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:36.940
<v 2>that.
If I wanted to have breakfast alone,
I would have gone alone.</v>

438
00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:39.970
But you didn't have breakfast alone.
Bring my breakfast alone.

439
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.250
It was not half of your breakfast.
It was,

440
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:47.510
<v 10>you're such a liar.
You lie.
You lie for a living.</v>

441
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:53.000
Oh my God.
This is a crazy amount of lies.
Seriously.

442
00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:58.640
And then really?
Yeah.
What?

443
00:30:58.641 --> 00:30:59.990
How?
How was your shit though?

444
00:30:59.991 --> 00:31:02.420
You didn't even do it was awesome and it only took a few minutes.

445
00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.890
That was back right away.
It wasn't,
it wasn't bs.
How was it on the trip?

446
00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:11.030
It was not bad.
A little bit.
A little bit of mud,
little sludge,

447
00:31:11.031 --> 00:31:12.320
but other than that,
it's fine.

448
00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:16.730
What caused putting off the tests that he wanted me to do because I'm doing that

449
00:31:16.731 --> 00:31:19.910
food allergy test.
See how that goes?

450
00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.240
<v 2>When's that happening?
Tomorrow.
Oh,
okay.
Good.</v>

451
00:31:22.241 --> 00:31:25.240
So we'll have some news for people next week.

452
00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:29.760
<v 10>Yeah.
Yeah.
Hopefully</v>

453
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:36.140
pretty good.
I think I have a food allergy.
What are you allergic tail.

454
00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:40.110
I don't know.
I'm too dumb to know,
but that's why I'm going.

455
00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.580
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
We'll see.

456
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.210
I'm excited to find out.
Yeah,
you always lie.

457
00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:53.010
And you always exaggerate about like how long I was gone and how crazy it is

458
00:31:53.011 --> 00:31:57.720
that I was gone.
So ridiculous.
You're always like,
oh my God,

459
00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:00.060
I had this whole meal alone.

460
00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:05.350
<v 2>I said half a mil.
Half the meal,
half of it.
What would you prefer?</v>

461
00:32:05.351 --> 00:32:08.050
I do in this situation,
I had to go,

462
00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:13.320
but here's the thing with you is that you can hold in the dump for a long time.

463
00:32:14.141 --> 00:32:16.840
We've been on road trips together where you're like,
I gotta dig a shit.

464
00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:21.120
You have to know that if I decide I got to go is because I got to go see.

465
00:32:21.121 --> 00:32:25.160
You've been holding it in already for like half hours.
He's saying,

466
00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:26.830
cause you can't hold it a long time.

467
00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:30.840
<v 10>Yeah.
I have to go when I go.</v>

468
00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:36.690
That's the whole point.
I have to go.
You don't get it.
I gotta go.

469
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:43.420
Uh,
you got it.

470
00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:49.630
You hit something.
Yeah.
What'd you do?

471
00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:53.960
<v 4>You ruined something.
I just hit this [inaudible] you always be ruined something.</v>

472
00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:54.853
What'd you ruin?

473
00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:59.150
I hate you the most.

474
00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:05.330
<v 9>Ah,
fuck it Todd.</v>

475
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:08.023
It's hot.

476
00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.020
<v 4>I need it to be less hot right now.
Okay.</v>

477
00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:15.540
<v 9>Uh,
oh.</v>

478
00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:20.420
<v 4>I know.
It's horrible.
I did,</v>

479
00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.380
<v 10>I did new show again this week.</v>

480
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:29.030
[inaudible] and sheer tenacity.
That was really fun.

481
00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:34.550
Um,
this is like the difference between the good ones and the not so good ones I

482
00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:38.600
figured out isn't me.
It's them.
It's when they're game for it.

483
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:42.700
And these people were like in such a good mood for this good.
I walk in,

484
00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.760
I had diamond earrings in and they're like,
hey,

485
00:33:45.761 --> 00:33:49.130
like they were just jazz for it,
you know?
Okay.

486
00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:53.090
Let me see if you can,
oh,

487
00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.510
<v 4>you know what?
Even on their own,
they put this up on the,
uh,</v>

488
00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:58.550
the Kyron no,

489
00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:03.710
they didn't own their own good that up on the Kyron.
Look at that.
I saw that on.

490
00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:08.990
So Tom Segura and then quotations,
the water champion.

491
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:13.220
Uh Huh.
Did I,
what did they say when you told him to put that up?
Okay.

492
00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:17.520
They're just like,
whatever.
Yeah.
That's so funny.
Yeah.
Wouldn't be a good idea.

493
00:34:17.521 --> 00:34:17.940
I don't think so.

494
00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:21.120
You talked about consuming a lot of h two o you want to talk about Water

495
00:34:21.121 --> 00:34:23.880
Olympics?
Well the water championships,
I actually won,

496
00:34:23.881 --> 00:34:28.740
I'm the current water champions southern California that have these
competitions.

497
00:34:28.741 --> 00:34:30.330
I drank two and a half gallons,

498
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:35.400
six hours and I'm just very proud of it,
you know.
Oddly enough,

499
00:34:35.401 --> 00:34:39.340
my wife also competed and she came in last place cause she dragged,

500
00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:42.720
you ever seen a Yorkie drink water?
And they go like,
yeah,

501
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.840
I,
it was great.
That's so funny.
Cause that's why some guys,

502
00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:56.600
I get it now because on Instagram I posted photos of me drinking water and this

503
00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:59.880
and people were like,
those are a Yorkie sips.
And I was like,
oh that's so funny.

504
00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:01.290
What a funny thing to say to me.

505
00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:07.500
Well now I see the origin is a Yorkie.
SIBS.
Yep.
That's a really funny,

506
00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:13.110
interesting.

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:57.660
<v 10>So I tell them the,

517
00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:03.350
which is that I talked to bart and I know it's Bark Chrysler.

518
00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:07.830
Oh boy.
I talked to Bart and now we are doing it.

519
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000
This comes on sale today it's the bird is fat shirt.

520
00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:17.700
Hashtag bird is fat.
We've um,

521
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:22.680
normally we wouldn't sell a shirt so close to the release of another shirt,

522
00:36:22.681 --> 00:36:25.500
you know,
we spread it out,
but this is special.
This is really special.

523
00:36:25.501 --> 00:36:30.501
We did lower the price because we wanted a people to get a little bit of a,

524
00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:35.880
a price break on it,
but it's still super high quality.
It's a,
what is it called?

525
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:40.340
A water based ink.
Smooth feel.
Um,

526
00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:43.500
and then you know,
it's really about picking teams.

527
00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:46.890
It's like what I was saying to this to this lady,
um,

528
00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:50.610
it's about picking the team because to be fair,

529
00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:55.530
twilight TMA affair,
we,
we also made a Thomas fat shirt.

530
00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:01.470
Barks been a good sport about it.
So we figured and I,
you know,
I get some of his,

531
00:37:01.471 --> 00:37:04.770
I get his seven fans will message me sometimes and be like,
no,

532
00:37:04.771 --> 00:37:09.771
you're a fat and then you 7,000 we'll hit him up.

533
00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:13.230
But here's what it's about.
We're splitting the costs,

534
00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:14.340
we're splitting everything in it.

535
00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:18.990
It's really about which team are you on it,
his team,

536
00:37:18.991 --> 00:37:20.340
Jacob and team.

537
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:26.610
If your team Tom get a bird is fat shirt.
If you're

538
00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:30.780
inside you get a Tom as fat shirt.

539
00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:36.050
They're going to be a ad on my site at [inaudible] dot com free shipping and the

542
00:37:44.701 --> 00:37:48.510
support.
He's fatter,

543
00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:51.920
He thinks he can rally his troops.
There's like 10 trips.
Like yeah,

544
00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:55.890
there's no troops.
I know.
So he doesn't have mommy power behind him.
Yeah,

545
00:37:55.891 --> 00:37:59.430
he was like,
he was like,
whatever.
Over normal pod coast.
Yeah,
you do.
It's fun.

546
00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:05.730
Some stupid

547
00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:13.800
fucking better than me.
His fans,

The dumb.

548
00:38:13.801 --> 00:38:17.390
His tweets to our fans,
super creative.

549
00:38:17.391 --> 00:38:21.350
Like they're like comedy writers and his fans were like,
fuck you man.

550
00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:25.430
And you're like,
oh good one.
Not Too smart.
No know.
Our listeners are smart.

551
00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:29.840
Well his listeners are,
have his same fucking like mentality.

552
00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:33.770
It's not,
it's kind of pretty baseline stuff,
you know,

553
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:39.120
again,
ah,

554
00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:41.180
<v 4>I predict,
uh,</v>

555
00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:45.990
the bird is fast shirts will be sold her the rate we're going to sell like two

556
00:38:45.991 --> 00:38:50.400
Thomas Fats.
I want it to like,
absolutely.
I want the numbers to just,

557
00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:52.920
I want it to be a landslide.
Like a massacre.
Of course.

558
00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:55.590
Like I want to start with like,
dude,
you know,
I actually,
you know what,

559
00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.590
there was actually substantial Thomas fat shirt,
so you know,
it was like,

560
00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:03.510
like 65 or something.
He's like,
see,
we told you,

561
00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.113
<v 11>Ooh,</v>

562
00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:12.280
<v 4>we sold 800 bird is fat shirts and then I hope people start wearing a bird is</v>

563
00:39:12.931 --> 00:39:17.340
fat shirts to Burt shows.
Oh,
for sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The best thing,

564
00:39:17.341 --> 00:39:22.341
but him to look out and see a sea of burden shirts as he's performing shirtless

565
00:39:23.091 --> 00:39:23.924
in clubs

566
00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:30.860
because he does his whole set shirtless and then he'll looks at like Subarus for

567
00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:35.280
anyways.
Okay.
It's very exciting.

568
00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:40.730
<v 10>It is very exciting.
It's very exciting.
I'm very hunched.
Check your email.
Okay.</v>

569
00:39:40.731 --> 00:39:41.564
Let's see.

570
00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:47.760
<v 4>What did you send me?
Ah,</v>

571
00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.990
okay.
For Christina,
this says,

572
00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:54.403
<v 10>I'm sorry.</v>

573
00:39:56.820 --> 00:40:01.400
<v 4>It's interesting.
We've compiled some images over the years here.</v>

574
00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:05.720
Uh,
you may want to look at the overwhelming evidence.
Now.

575
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:13.010
What the fuck is this blue band here was kind enough to compile these evidence,

576
00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:16.940
more evidence against you being the water champion,
number one.

577
00:40:16.941 --> 00:40:20.800
You'll notice that as a full bottle of water.

578
00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:25.520
So this is still have your special completely normal on Frick's.

579
00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:28.820
And if you'll look at the bottom,
the time code here,

580
00:40:28.821 --> 00:40:33.821
it's the very end of your special and you've got a completely full bottle of

581
00:40:34.731 --> 00:40:39.140
water onstage with you.
It's like rob water.
I can't tell him which one is,

582
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:42.530
it looks full to me actually.
I don't know how anybody could be able to,

583
00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:46.670
I can see it just fine the way though.
The light hits it.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Blue Bam.

584
00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:49.570
Thank you.
Yana mass submit.

585
00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:53.150
<v 10>Yeah.
Consideration.
Okay.</v>

586
00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:56.660
<v 4>That,
that is one full bottle of water.</v>

587
00:40:56.780 --> 00:41:01.190
So you just have it there so people think you hydrate.
Okay.

588
00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:06.250
It's prop water like it always is with you all show no drinking.

589
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:11.240
You never drink it.
You never take one sip and that's special.
Okay,

590
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:14.690
let's look at the other evidence.
Your honor,
please.
Okay,
one second.
One second.

591
00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:17.360
Let me get this real quick.

592
00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:21.430
<v 10>It's really dark image.
No,</v>

593
00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:28.910
let me see.
Does this play about Bark Chrysler?
Okay.
Sorry.

594
00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:33.860
Sorry.
Just making sure that was here.
Um,
can we please

595
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:37.350
<v 2>Chrysler?
Sorry.
Part Chrysler.
He's so fat.</v>

596
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:44.150
Okay.
All right.
Uh,
now this is your next bit of evidence here.

597
00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:47.080
Yes.
Okay.
Here we go.
Hmm.

598
00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:51.410
That's curious how you're messing this up.
Okay.

599
00:41:51.411 --> 00:41:56.411
And this is your other mostly stories and if you'll notice where at the very end

600
00:41:56.661 --> 00:41:59.270
of the special here and the time code,
it's at the end,

601
00:41:59.271 --> 00:42:04.271
you can see and there is yet another full water bottle and that's at the very

602
00:42:04.971 --> 00:42:07.100
end.
Look,
you took a leg maybe like,

603
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:11.540
like you would say a Yorkie sip and then the rest of it's totally full and we're

604
00:42:11.541 --> 00:42:16.190
at the end of the special.
Okay,
so again,
more stunt water,
all talk,

605
00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:21.110
no hydration.
If you ask anybody listening now,

606
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:25.010
that was at the Saturday late show,
let's say,
okay,

607
00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.370
let's ask them how the,
how the set ended because I'll tell you what happened.

608
00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:33.290
I did a show at the end when the show was over,

609
00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:36.950
a pounded a bottle of water for everybody and they celebrate.

610
00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:41.450
You didn't do that on mostly stories
I did off camera.

611
00:42:41.451 --> 00:42:45.620
Didn't make never hydrate off camera.
We all know this.

612
00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:48.950
Okay,
next piece of evidence please.
Yana.

613
00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:54.470
I was at the comedy store the Saturday and I hydrated while I was on stage.

614
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:55.970
Mommy's were in the audience.
Again,

615
00:42:56.330 --> 00:43:00.590
allow this evidence here you have a full glass of this is you on stage this and

616
00:43:00.591 --> 00:43:05.540
Austin Sacramento and you've got a full glass,

617
00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.480
a pint glass of water with a little slice of lemon.

618
00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:13.880
Also at the end of the set we had this listener submit this as evidence that you

619
00:43:13.881 --> 00:43:18.410
didn't touch that water the whole time anyways,
a lot of water,
no drinking,

620
00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:22.750
and there we go.
All this.
This one's the most compelling beginning of the set.

621
00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:27.740
How would you know that?
How is she doing?
What is she doing?
She's in disbelief.

622
00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:30.920
This is
for me in Irvine,

623
00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:34.650
in sperm vine and Tom is closing out his set.

624
00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:39.720
Know a pint glass of water and the interpretor because interpretor there,

625
00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:42.980
she's eyeballing the water.

626
00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:47.420
You've drawn a line from her to make it look like she's looking at the water,

627
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:50.730
but like,
wow,
I've never seen that much water.
Exactly.
That's so stupid.

628
00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:55.740
Exactly like how long this man's been talking without taking a lot of doing the

629
00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:59.160
shit.
Nobody believe.

630
00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:08.600
That's so ridiculous.
That's ridiculous.
And it's not accurate.

631
00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:10.850
Nothing that you do.
And also there've been reports.

632
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:15.950
My reports indicate that while on the road performing to you hydrate with club

633
00:44:15.951 --> 00:44:17.870
soda with Soda Water,

634
00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:22.900
which isn't the same as water because our sodium and actually dehydrates you.

635
00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:28.360
Oh my sources say that you drank soda water.
Never.

636
00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:32.010
You can ask anybody.
Hey,
where you at?
The Liberty Township shows

637
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.550
<v 4>this weekend people will see me drinking bottles of water.
People were like,</v>

638
00:44:35.551 --> 00:44:38.910
you're the fucking water champ.
People were yelling at outman.
Okay.
Yeah.

639
00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.080
<v 2>I know what I've been having,</v>

640
00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:45.790
and I'm sorry to admit this guy's number ones and number twos the last couple of

641
00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:48.820
days,
just not,
I haven't been eating well.

642
00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:53.520
I've been taking a lot of like these new vitamins.
I think it's the vitamin,

643
00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:58.380
the Biedermann's.
Yeah,
and water.
I haven't been drinking as much water.
You Go,

644
00:44:58.381 --> 00:44:59.870
you got,
you got it.
Soften

645
00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:01.420
<v 4>that stool of Yana.</v>

646
00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:07.440
That's episode two 74 your mom's house and 20 minute mark.

647
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:15.390
Defendant admits she does not consume the eggs too,

648
00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:20.950
that she claimed to this.
Now,
first of all,
I was this close,

649
00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:25.390
isolated again incident.
It sounded as if I was sick.
Something was going on.

650
00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:28.270
If we could contextualize that properly,
that would be great.

651
00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:31.710
You know the other thing we can conduct lives.
We have a new logo for the tracks.

652
00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:36.670
You realize here's the new word over the show.
New logo for your mom's house.

653
00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:40.390
Here it is.
You're looking at it.
That's the logo.

654
00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:43.690
It's me bed and it just says Tom,

655
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:46.960
the water champion and that's to your mom's house.
Looks dumb.

656
00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:52.070
There you go.
You look good with those damn earrings.
Actually,
I know.
I got it.

657
00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:54.180
If a good on the last patriarch did,

658
00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:56.440
nobody said I thought they were going to be like,
ha ha.
And they're all like,

659
00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:02.350
well,
that outfit is like it.
Actually.
It's just part of that outfit,
right?

660
00:46:02.351 --> 00:46:07.030
There's a black shirt with gold lion on it.
That hat,
those sunglasses.

661
00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:09.970
Nobody even gives me shit about wearing sunglasses at these things.

662
00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:13.090
I thought this one would be like,
are you serious?
He's such an asshole.
No,

663
00:46:13.091 --> 00:46:16.660
I think thought it.
I was like,
what a jerk.
Of course that isn't asshole move.

664
00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:17.620
I'm not supposed to do that.

665
00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:20.530
But I think at these shows when you walk in like this,

666
00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.440
they think that's your real,
that's the real deal.

667
00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:25.210
He's a comedian so you get away with it.

668
00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:28.300
But I don't think they think I'm being funny.
You know what I mean?

669
00:46:28.301 --> 00:46:32.230
I think they like,
oh that's how that guy,
where's your water right now?

670
00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:36.850
I'm third year saying,
please,
please,
I'm thirsty.
What's the next least?
Come on.

671
00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:40.400
I have it.
Give me the fucking water.
Why don't you have,

672
00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:42.970
cause I asked you to bring it and you wouldn't fucking bring it.

673
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:47.050
You know what I have for you?
What?
Cause I love you.
I have backup.

674
00:46:47.051 --> 00:46:51.840
Look was in the tiny fridge under the desk.
Backup.

675
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:54.790
Hydration's.
Why?
Because I'm the real water champions.

676
00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:58.710
Really Shit about hydrating.
Is it cold?

677
00:46:59.830 --> 00:47:02.110
Thank you.
What flavor?

678
00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:08.820
That's a Kedwin.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's been a long time since I've had a great fruit.

679
00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:12.240
Look,
it's not like Croix,
is it?

680
00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:16.780
When is it Lacroix L'aquila they claim it's Lacroix.
I don't think so.

681
00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:21.280
But then Saint Croix,
right?
That place Saint Croix.
It's the same

682
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:27.820
pump pump.
Lynn Moose.
Now

683
00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:35.580
how that's going to start and that's why we stopped drinking these on this show

684
00:47:35.831 --> 00:47:40.660
because,
oh,
that's right.
We're really adequate.
It's so blue bay.
I was like,
um,

685
00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:45.010
you guys were burping a lot on these.
Look,
look,
watch episodes.

686
00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:50.450
So we cut it out.
Shit.
You're right.
Yeah.
Oh Wow.
It's hot.
Can we lower their well,

687
00:47:50.451 --> 00:47:54.740
is baby jeans still sleeping?
I don't know.
He can handle it.
Bed.
Okay.

688
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:57.583
What's

689
00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:05.260
going on?
All right.
Yeah,
so blue man.

690
00:48:05.261 --> 00:48:10.180
Just remind me to remind people that I'm ordered double pipe,

691
00:48:10.181 --> 00:48:14.320
classic shirts that haven't gotten them,
that they're all coming out this week.

692
00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:19.390
Oh,
that's such a good shirt.
The reorders.
I've been wearing mine.
It's very soft.

693
00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:23.680
It fits nicely is,
and you're sharing something really cool with the world.

694
00:48:23.681 --> 00:48:27.340
You know you've been on this kick by the way,
where you're like,

695
00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:30.460
you want to hear really cool fart.
I got you.

696
00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:36.940
I got you.
Good yesterday too.
I go,
you want to hear it cool?
Far and you go,
nope.

697
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.210
And I farted real big back.

698
00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:42.610
Remember I sat on your lap and I farted.

699
00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:47.150
You also fostered in your middle of your sleep last night?
Yeah.

700
00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:52.070
And it was like you don't remember that it was like a three parter from my mom

701
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:54.463
and you went,

702
00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:58.930
you don't remember that and then you reached over and you like tap me and I'm

703
00:48:58.931 --> 00:49:02.110
like fame.
You're like pointing it out in your sleep.

704
00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:08.560
Yes.
Yes.
Wow.
I feel like I'm the FARC champ then.

705
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.420
Yeah.
It was really,
really nice to be like dead asleep.

706
00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:18.590
<v 1>[inaudible] you</v>

707
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:23.640
<v 4>and your sleep.
Oh my.</v>

708
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:30.600
Um,
oh my gosh.
There's a lot to go over.

709
00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:34.430
There's a,
what do you want first foray into my sleep.
I'm so proud of.

710
00:49:34.450 --> 00:49:37.790
I'm proud of myself.
You want to talk about uh,
gender pronouns or whatever.

711
00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.200
We haven't visited that world in a minute.

712
00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:43.440
I'm curious to know how are you feeling today?
What Pronoun Are you going by?

713
00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:48.960
You said that was so much surface level contempt.

714
00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:55.470
You're like,
how are you feeling today?
What Pronoun Do you feel like?

715
00:49:57.830 --> 00:50:01.440
Yeah,
I'm serious.
What Pronoun Are we going by?
What are you doing?

716
00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:05.700
I am a lead gender.
What's that?
How the gender,
Allie,

717
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:08.670
what does that is new?
I uh,

718
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.600
it's like when you incorporate like,

719
00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:17.790
it's like your Arabic,
but you're a,
you're like a donkey,

720
00:50:17.791 --> 00:50:21.540
but you're also like a sexless.

721
00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:25.970
I know what you're talking about.
Arabic tellable

722
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:30.950
you're Arab.
Sorry.
Arab gendered.
Okay.

723
00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:32.731
<v 12>Hey everybody,</v>

724
00:50:32.731 --> 00:50:36.270
welcome back this week and we'll be talking to you about sweet on nouns and

725
00:50:36.271 --> 00:50:40.440
pronouns.
Preferred gender pronouns or PGPS,
um,
PG,
whatever you call him.

726
00:50:40.441 --> 00:50:43.890
Pronounce the things we used to refer to people in the third person that aren't

727
00:50:43.891 --> 00:50:44.724
their names.

728
00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:49.170
They're also often used as the linguistic representation that people's gender

729
00:50:49.171 --> 00:50:54.060
identities.
So you're really important.
Really,
really,

730
00:50:54.061 --> 00:50:54.780
really,

731
00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:59.550
<v 4>what's his pronoun?
Well,
I'll wait and he said,
shoot,
I,
I didn't want,</v>

732
00:50:59.551 --> 00:51:02.460
I didn't mean to,
you might have,
I mean,

733
00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:07.470
Z day.
Yeah,
you can go.
They them.
Yeah.

734
00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:09.930
Um,
fuck.
Yeah.

735
00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:15.720
<v 12>The first and most important rule regarding pronouns is to respect people's</v>

736
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:19.110
pronouns.
That's a big thing.
Holly's,
there should be no question.

737
00:51:19.350 --> 00:51:21.390
There are no exceptions.
If someone says,

738
00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:24.150
this is the Pronoun I want you to use to refer to me,

739
00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:27.630
that is the Pronoun you will use her for.
To them period.

740
00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:32.840
To do otherwise is offensive and invalidating and humiliating and at best

741
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:34.103
awkward.

742
00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:36.300
<v 4>I agree with that.
That's,
I mean,
that's an,</v>

743
00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:39.780
that's an honest statement right there.
Once somebody says,
call me.

744
00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:44.940
Like if you're like,
hey guys,
I'm not a she,
I'm a Zit.

745
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:49.960
Zared deserve them.
Zam They Zurbaran

746
00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:58.430
[inaudible] he's saying,
I'm not a Zuckerberg.
You're offending me right now.
Oh,

747
00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:01.170
you have to identify me in the way in which I chose,

748
00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:04.410
I've chosen to be identity to what you're saying.
Yeah.
I use in,

749
00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:08.700
I'd actually had never heard Zuckerberg.
I'm as overt gendered.
Okay.
It's from,

750
00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:11.940
it's a pre rape Cosby era.
Crazy.

751
00:52:11.941 --> 00:52:14.820
Herbert's you ever heard of dessert?
I'm the guys we show

752
00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:21.080
[inaudible] [inaudible] put it in pop up in your pussy.

753
00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:25.170
Right,
right,
right.
Yeah,
I remember.

754
00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:28.380
Um,
okay.
So far I'm on board.

755
00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:31.290
<v 12>I'm a rule number two.
Always ask,</v>

756
00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:36.180
don't assume it's far better to ask me someone's Pronoun is just be like,
hey,
hi.

757
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:38.070
How are you?
What's your name?
What's Your Pronoun?

758
00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:41.350
<v 4>Okay.
I don't know that part.
Let's be honest.</v>

759
00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:45.940
That's a little more than awkward to be like,
yeah,
what's up?

760
00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:49.190
What's Your Pronoun?
No,
no,
no.
I mean,
uh,

761
00:52:50.050 --> 00:52:54.980
he's trying to make it seem like that's not a big deal to do that.
Yeah,

762
00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:57.460
I understand the idea of like we should all,

763
00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:01.120
you should find out the person's Pronoun,
but it is kind of a weird question.

764
00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:05.470
Like it is kind of hard to be like,
hi.
Hi.
Nice meeting you.
What's your,

765
00:53:05.471 --> 00:53:08.110
what's your pronoun?
Yeah.
It's like say,
Hey,
what's up?
What's going on?

766
00:53:08.111 --> 00:53:11.530
Can I see your tits real quick?
Right.
Look,
that's how you test your balls.

767
00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:13.030
Are they small balls?
Yeah.

768
00:53:13.031 --> 00:53:15.700
Do you like when you do we like Cox and hangalow balls or by your hand below

769
00:53:15.701 --> 00:53:19.540
cogs?
Yeah,
I guess,
but I maybe,
you know,
I don't know.

770
00:53:19.570 --> 00:53:23.170
He's saying it's not a big deal.
I think it's a big deal.
Yeah.
Yeah.

771
00:53:23.171 --> 00:53:25.950
Cause I'm a person,
I've interacted with people and I know that it's a big deal

772
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.320
<v 2>to be like,
Hey,
what's your name?
What's that?
What's your pronouns?</v>

773
00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:31.290
That girl at the comedy store.
I thought it was non-binary.

774
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:34.910
I wanted her to come in and I was like,
oh,
you're non-binary.
Right?

775
00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:35.940
And she looked at me like,

776
00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:39.960
go fuck yourself for me to ask essentially what's your pronoun?

777
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:43.050
She kind of gave me an a go fuck yourself.
She didn't,
she didn't say it,

778
00:53:43.051 --> 00:53:46.350
but her eyes were like,
wait,
what?
She's like,
oh no,
I'm not nine bear binary.

779
00:53:46.351 --> 00:53:50.160
My friend's daughter is or whatever,
and I'm like,
Oh,
did she?

780
00:53:50.170 --> 00:53:54.350
She didn't like the Pronoun question that she look nonbinary.
Yeah,
yeah.

781
00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:58.540
She's definitely other gender identified,
but I don't know.

782
00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:02.610
You know what a Pronoun is?
I don't know.
See,

783
00:54:02.611 --> 00:54:04.110
I feel like it's offensive to ask her.

784
00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:09.210
It feels this guys thing of like she used to always ask is not,

785
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:13.950
especially as a cisgendered person,
I feel as though my cisgendered privilege.

786
00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:18.390
You know what I'm saying?
Like I feel like I'm being a deck.
Hey,
what's up?

787
00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:19.180
What's Your Pronoun?

788
00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:23.070
Don't assume it's far better to ask for someone's Pronoun is just be like,
Hey,

789
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:26.910
I think he has burns.
What's your name?
What's Your Pronoun?
Not have a dealer.
Hey,

790
00:54:26.911 --> 00:54:29.020
just want her to confirm what's,
what'd you pronto?
Isn't he?

791
00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:33.600
He's nice bird away.
What gender is the bird?

792
00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:38.310
Is it rude to ask Bluebell?
What gender is that?
Bird.

793
00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:46.200
Chirps.
I do think that's a lot to ask,

794
00:54:46.201 --> 00:54:48.630
man.
I want to put the burden,
the other room,

795
00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:52.380
gender identity and how they present themselves.
You care about their pronouns.

796
00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:58.470
You'd ask that someone's name.
You should ask about the Pronoun to.
All right.

797
00:54:58.471 --> 00:55:02.760
All right.
All right.
Yeah,
that seems like a lot to do.

798
00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:07.020
I think someone should bring it up.
That's what I mean.
Yes.
I think.

799
00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:11.250
I think that what you need to ask of somebody who has respect people's pronouns,

800
00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:15.750
but to be like start going around asking people,
how about you volunteers?

801
00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:21.620
Especially like if you know people are going to assume that you're one or the

802
00:55:22.801 --> 00:55:26.010
other because then now you're going to be more offended when someone calls you a

803
00:55:26.011 --> 00:55:30.940
he and you're not.
Not a lot to ask.
Yeah.
If you were to walk in and be like,
I'm,

804
00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:36.360
hi,
my name is Christina,
please refer to me as bay.
Yeah.
Otherwise,

805
00:55:36.361 --> 00:55:39.000
why would anybody assumed that you're not going to let you know what I mean?

806
00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:41.930
Then you can't get all offended at people.
Maybe he's not.

807
00:55:41.970 --> 00:55:46.970
Maybe he's saying to ask when you think somebody's on the,

808
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:51.720
you know yeah.
On the gender line,
the non,
the non binary.
Yeah.

809
00:55:51.721 --> 00:55:55.170
Maybe I didn't hear that in the clip but maybe that's what he's implying.

810
00:55:55.171 --> 00:55:56.130
I don't know.
I don't see that.

811
00:55:56.550 --> 00:56:00.720
Most people are really like when someone asks of them cause it can feel very

812
00:56:00.721 --> 00:56:05.040
welcome birds.
Shane leaves really coming out.

813
00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:09.840
You got to watch the audio guy
and you're like,

814
00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:13.320
okay cool.
He's sweet.

815
00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:16.350
He's the way he's saying that he's,
he no,

816
00:56:16.351 --> 00:56:19.260
he's saying if you asked somebody in there he that you know,

817
00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:24.100
oh you're going to be like,
oh Duh.
I mean coming out.
Worst case I want

818
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:27.010
<v 12>to be like,
uh,
my pronouns.
He does.
And you're like,
okay,</v>

819
00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:29.260
well cool memories and it's not a big deal at all.

820
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.400
<v 4>Oh I see.
I think it's a big deal still.
I think minimizing,</v>

821
00:56:34.530 --> 00:56:38.590
asking them what have you really offend somebody by asking them,
listen,

822
00:56:38.591 --> 00:56:42.430
the world is too complicated for me now with all these new,
uh,
genders,

823
00:56:42.431 --> 00:56:44.480
I don't know what to do.
Yeah.
I think,

824
00:56:44.490 --> 00:56:48.760
I think you can really guide the guide is it's making it more complicated.

825
00:56:48.761 --> 00:56:50.030
I don't know.
Yeah,

826
00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:53.380
<v 12>there are a lot of pronouns out.
They're like,
no,</v>

827
00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:57.670
I want more slowly and slowly adding more.

828
00:56:58.150 --> 00:57:03.040
So the two most common allergen he has is traditionally considered a male

829
00:57:03.041 --> 00:57:07.480
pronouns.
She initially considered eight female pronouns.
However,

830
00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:12.070
it's important to note that some people use he or she but did not identify as

831
00:57:12.071 --> 00:57:13.240
male or female.

832
00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:18.060
<v 4>Now you're really fucking people up.
So now he,</v>

833
00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:22.510
not only do you have to say like,
all right,
whatever gender you are is fine.

834
00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:27.370
I might like,
he don't fucking think that makes me a male gender.

835
00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:31.090
Fuck him on.
So now we have to ask,
what do you prefer?

836
00:57:31.091 --> 00:57:35.940
And then what really are you under that?
Oh,
that's so much work.

837
00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:38.560
<v 12>Yeah.
Just an Lti common ones are he and she,</v>

838
00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:43.360
she has is traditionally considered a male pronoun and she is true initially

839
00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:46.090
considered female pronouns.
Awesome.
However,

840
00:57:46.450 --> 00:57:50.620
it's important to note that some people use he or she but did not identify as

841
00:57:50.621 --> 00:57:52.510
male or female.
So

842
00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:56.660
<v 4>they're assholes.
Just so you know,
they should identify,
someone says,
Oh,</v>

843
00:57:56.740 --> 00:58:01.630
don't make life easy for everybody.
Just identify words,
fucking Pronoun.
Of course

844
00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:06.090
<v 12>you can't just assume that they're male or you know,
if they say she can't see.</v>

845
00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:09.050
Um,
so if you were to say like I prefer,

846
00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:11.770
I prefer like masculine pronouns are male pronouns.

847
00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:14.530
It's sort of implying that everyone else who uses he

848
00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:17.980
uses,
you know,

849
00:58:17.981 --> 00:58:21.520
it is male or that like everyone else who identify as male uses heat,

850
00:58:21.521 --> 00:58:23.020
which is not also not necessarily the case.

851
00:58:23.350 --> 00:58:26.440
So it's better to just say I prefer he'd be done with it.

852
00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:29.430
<v 4>Any new people ever.
Because</v>

853
00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:34.620
in 2016 it is a complicated thing to meet a new person.

854
00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:37.650
How about no,
no new anyone.

855
00:58:37.830 --> 00:58:42.830
I'm going to start saying I like he him as my preferred Pronoun,

856
00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:49.460
but I'm not necessarily mail to people when they meet me.

857
00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:55.700
I wish she could explain this to your dad.
That's a great one to bring it out.

858
00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:59.940
Let's do that.
Actually let's play the clip for him.
What?

859
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:00.840
That's what we're going to hear a lot.

860
00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.610
Play that for your dad and we understand what he is.
Okay.

861
00:59:07.350 --> 00:59:09.650
This is real new stuff to me buddy.
Yeah,

862
00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:13.250
<v 12>no.
So then they're also gender neutral pronouns.</v>

863
00:59:14.090 --> 00:59:17.870
Gender neutral pronouns can be used for anybody of any gender and they have no

864
00:59:17.871 --> 00:59:22.140
gendered meanings attached to them at all,
which is cool.
Um,

865
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:26.910
and there are so many of them it was commonly used is they,

866
00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:28.490
they is traditionally plural,

867
00:59:28.491 --> 00:59:32.000
but we already used in the singular form to like maintain people's anonymity

868
00:59:32.001 --> 00:59:34.490
here.
Like if you just don't know what their gender is,
you'll be like,
oh,

869
00:59:34.491 --> 00:59:38.300
I was talking to a student and they told me Blah,
blah,
blah.
Totally normal.

870
00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:42.120
So you can use it for specific people as well.
And a lot of people prefer they,

871
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.680
okay.

872
00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:45.130
<v 2>That's all that's on my Twitter bio.
Right.</v>

873
00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:47.110
You're the one of those people that prefer they now.

874
00:59:47.770 --> 00:59:51.490
How's that working out for you?
Are People Respecting your pronoun mostly?

875
00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:58.040
Well,
I think you really should.

876
00:59:58.041 --> 01:00:00.980
It be really funny if you insisted that like your agent,

877
01:00:00.981 --> 01:00:04.700
your manager call you babe,
do you think they would respect that

878
01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:08.770
you think they would?
How do you institute this with,

879
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:10.490
<v 12>when next thing is common?
I,
hold on,</v>

880
01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:15.400
Z can be spelled a bunch of different ways.
Why?

881
01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:17.340
<v 2>This is what I'm saying.
Like,
okay,</v>

882
01:00:17.341 --> 01:00:19.680
I get this in theory and I understand it as a theory.

883
01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:24.000
How do you institute a new Pronoun Policy in your personal life?

884
01:00:24.030 --> 01:00:27.990
Videos like this,
keep putting videos out guys.
It'sZ ,

885
01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:31.770
Vermont to your employer,
Dakota,
who was like,
oh my God,

886
01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.920
there's a not a preference is a requirement.
Yeah.

887
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:39.390
He went to della Mae explaining it to your family,

888
01:00:39.391 --> 01:00:41.600
your friends,
your Twitter.
While it's,

889
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:45.750
it's overwhelming.
I think there's also this

890
01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:46.733
<v 10>total</v>

891
01:00:47.370 --> 01:00:52.290
<v 2>bullshit,
uh,
pushback on an anybody again who questions or,</v>

892
01:00:52.770 --> 01:00:54.510
or it makes jokes about any of this.
They're like,

893
01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:58.970
you don't fucking get the LGBT community.
You know,
like they,

894
01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:03.830
well actually I've been talking to LGBT community people,
it's Lgbtq now

895
01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:10.550
and a lot of the people I've talked to don't,
I don't,
it's different.

896
01:01:10.551 --> 01:01:13.890
Like they think that this stuff is kinda out there.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

897
01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:17.580
Yeah.
They're not really on board.
Right.
Because like,
like when I feel shit,

898
01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:21.190
I'm like gay.
That's different than sexual orientation.
Yes.

899
01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:26.200
So that's not the same you guys.
We gotta be respectful.
You know,

900
01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:30.150
Jesus Christ,
too many things.
Too many things.

901
01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:34.130
<v 12>My Dad,
I feel like I'm on the fucking whole world we live in now.</v>

902
01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.680
It's like declension lake.
So like he,
him,

903
01:01:36.681 --> 01:01:41.630
his and then Z fucking headache already from here.
Zee.

904
01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:46.550
Zee like German are,
yeah,

905
01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:52.280
there are a lot.
Throw a lot of options.
Senses.
I prefer Z.

906
01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:56.120
Ask them what spelling,
if they can use it in a sentence.
No I'm not.

907
01:01:56.121 --> 01:01:58.370
And that shows how much you care that you want to get their pronouns.
Right.

908
01:01:58.371 --> 01:01:59.600
So that's,
that's a good one.

909
01:01:59.601 --> 01:02:02.780
If you don't want to get them right cause you're too tired to get your pronouns.

910
01:02:02.781 --> 01:02:04.940
I'd also seen air like,

911
01:02:04.941 --> 01:02:09.941
like they but without the t h I've also seen dawn come combination of that.

912
01:02:11.370 --> 01:02:12.030
Fuck that one.

913
01:02:12.030 --> 01:02:17.030
Yes or huge or for human or commerce per person or Hurley or really or yo

914
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:24.960
<v 4>or ah,
there's so many options.
It's so fascinating.</v>

915
01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:30.810
That's the word I choose.
A burden

916
01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:36.240
to put on other people.
It's exhausting.
It's exhausting.

917
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:41.970
Station is pronouns.
Ask about on if you're not sure.
Always a good idea.

918
01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:45.630
There's so much more to talk about with pronouns that I just don't want to talk

919
01:02:45.631 --> 01:02:49.680
forever.
No,
we feel the same way.
So he's sweet.

920
01:02:50.010 --> 01:02:53.140
He's a sweet guy,
but really cute kid.
Shit man.
After that,

921
01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:56.480
I'm sorry I was disrespectful and I didn't ask his personality.

922
01:02:56.481 --> 01:02:59.640
I don't even know their partner after that.

923
01:02:59.641 --> 01:03:01.410
I feel like we could probably get into something like this.

924
01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:09.430
<v 7>It feels better.
Cleanse the palate.</v>

925
01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:23.160
Somebody that claims to have the longest part.
Recording,
recording,

926
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:28.280
recording.
A lot of people have seen this video and feel like,

927
01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:32.180
you know,
manipulate it.

928
01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:40.690
<v 4>We'll also play this for my mother.
What do you think she'll say in this one?</v>

929
01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:45.300
There's a video.
Great.
But the visuals better.
Yeah.

930
01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:49.100
This is when you got to get on the youtube to see guys.
We should tell her.

931
01:03:49.101 --> 01:03:51.760
This is Brian.
Should I believe it?

932
01:03:58.230 --> 01:04:03.230
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

933
01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:11.910
<v 4>I know there's room tone here.</v>

934
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.050
At least he knows how to edit cause there's some room tone.

935
01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:20.710
Sounds authentic.
We're 40 seconds into this fucking car right now.

936
01:04:21.010 --> 01:04:24.840
And then when he breathes,
it changes the tone of the fire.
Really?
Wow.

937
01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:29.050
That is interesting.
But there's fluctuations and

938
01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:35.190
<v 7>[inaudible] right</v>

939
01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:46.010
<v 4>now.
How come he's hiding his face?
I'd be proud if</v>

940
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:51.870
he doesn't feel like you.
You know why he's not a Cincinnati fighter like me?
Ooh.

941
01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:56.900
Do you realize we are just over a month away from now?

942
01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:00.260
It's a big deal,
by the way,
this weekend.

943
01:05:00.261 --> 01:05:03.380
And a lot of people were asking and you know,
I had press schedule,

944
01:05:03.381 --> 01:05:06.200
I had to see family.
I wasn't able to go down there,

945
01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:11.750
but the Lou ban went and visited the,
uh,
was it,

946
01:05:11.751 --> 01:05:16.260
what do you call her?
Yeah,
zero.
Um,
you went to the renaissance?
Yeah.

947
01:05:16.550 --> 01:05:18.190
How was it?
It was,

948
01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:22.510
<v 2>it was better than I expected.
Wow.
Really?
Yeah.
I mean,</v>

949
01:05:23.090 --> 01:05:26.230
you were able to like do some stuff that we'll see a little bit later.
Yeah.

950
01:05:26.231 --> 01:05:29.740
Like I want to go into details,
but I also don't want to give away the surprise.

951
01:05:29.810 --> 01:05:32.320
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah,
we'll have wow.

952
01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:37.330
But then have some stuff to show at some point.
Yeah.
Amazing stuff ahead.
Wow.

953
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:42.010
I can't wait.
What a claim.
Yeah.
Well,
this guy is far,
it's pretty impressive.

954
01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:44.940
He's at a minute and five I can see as the final.
Yeah.

955
01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:49.250
What do you think your tally was?
I,
you know,
I,
I'll be honest,
I,

956
01:05:49.251 --> 01:05:53.280
I'm going to give it
realistically.
Yeah,

957
01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:58.110
20 seconds.
Yeah.
Do you feel that's an accurate representation?

958
01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:01.030
That's a long farm and it was long,

959
01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:05.170
but that's why it's the Cincinnati Fart.
It's not your every day for it.

960
01:06:05.171 --> 01:06:08.350
It's a fart that goes down in history.
Yeah.
It's a fort.

961
01:06:08.351 --> 01:06:11.950
You tell your children's Children's children,
and I'll tell you something,

962
01:06:12.250 --> 01:06:17.250
people know more than you might imagine about it.

963
01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:22.450
Really?
Yes.
What does that mean?
Very cryptic.
It's not as big a mystery.

964
01:06:22.451 --> 01:06:26.620
It's not as hidden as you think.
It's not just on the show,

965
01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:30.190
really.
It's people in Cincinnati now.

966
01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:35.860
You mean the word?
Uh,
the smell is spread,
if you will.

967
01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:41.110
Locals know best.
Wow.
That's what I'll say.
Wow.
Yeah.
Well,
I'm,

968
01:06:41.111 --> 01:06:44.370
I'm curious to hear this audio and I look forward to it and you'll believe blue

969
01:06:44.371 --> 01:06:47.800
man.
It'll happen.
It'll happen.
Wow.
Wow.

970
01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:55.950
<v 7>This is still going the minute,
minute.
A long time.</v>

971
01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:07.590
Wow.
Oh,

972
01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:10.080
<v 2>you gave a little magic man at the end.</v>

973
01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:13.230
What it even smells like in that room right now.
I honestly,
I think those,

974
01:07:13.650 --> 01:07:18.180
those kinds of,
the sound,
it doesn't have the same smell.
It's got a lot of sound.

975
01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:20.730
Then there's not a lot of heat and not a lot of the smell,

976
01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:25.260
but sometimes there's real powerful short ones,
not minute long.
That smell.

977
01:07:25.290 --> 01:07:30.090
That was all for show.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That guy is impressive,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

978
01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:33.520
Oh yeah.
That's good work.
Yeah.
This.

979
01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:37.590
One of the things I was excited about when I saw this clip come in.

980
01:07:37.591 --> 01:07:40.950
Let me see if I know know I had a fart when you were gone.

981
01:07:41.010 --> 01:07:45.810
I had an Amy's frozen dinner,
which was a big mistake,

982
01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:50.130
and then I had some ranch flavored Kale chips on top of it.

983
01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:53.250
Bad idea,
bad idea.

984
01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:58.170
I laid in bed and I farted and it was like he ever fart and the smell is so

985
01:07:58.171 --> 01:08:02.370
foreign to you.
You're like,
dude,
I've never even made a smell like that before.

986
01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:06.090
Yeah,
that's what it felt like.
He was like someone else's Fart.

987
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.983
It wasn't even mine.

988
01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:09.990
Those are really a trip where there were times when you travel,

989
01:08:09.991 --> 01:08:11.730
you have those where you take your shit and you're like,

990
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:14.430
if somebody's shooting between my legs right here right now,

991
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:16.250
is someone else farting

992
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:20.880
<v 4>in bed with me because this part doesn't smell like my own brand.
Yeah,</v>

993
01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:23.710
those are those really kind of scare you a little bit.
To me,

994
01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.540
they do like when it upsets you

995
01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.380
because you're not supposed to be upset by your own.

996
01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:33.890
That's the whole point of the joy of foreign.
You know that it doesn't upset you.

997
01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:38.920
There's a reason for that is not just because it's not that that it's yours,

998
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:44.110
it's that your brain alerts you that this isn't going to smell good.

999
01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:50.210
And when you're,
when that happens,
the way you processed the smell.

1000
01:08:51.790 --> 01:08:56.160
Yeah,
it's different.
Versus like if you walk as a surprise one,

1001
01:08:56.161 --> 01:08:59.600
interesting because your brain tells you there's going to smell bad.

1002
01:08:59.601 --> 01:09:03.650
It's a reward when it comes true.
You're validating.
You're like,
oh yeah,

1003
01:09:03.651 --> 01:09:08.360
it doesn't smell so interesting.
So the,
it smells the writer.

1004
01:09:08.370 --> 01:09:12.650
You are like,
the more correct your brain is and that's why he get a high.
Wow.

1005
01:09:12.651 --> 01:09:17.570
What a neat science scientific episode for our listeners.

1006
01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:21.950
Pretty neat.
Pretty neat man.

1007
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:26.570
Always trying to teach this stuff on this show.
Stories about education.

1008
01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:32.000
Um,
do you want to hear this one?
I thought you would really enjoy,

1009
01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:35.930
we've actually seen this guy before,
but never on,
never this clip.

1010
01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:40.180
<v 13>Oh,
everyone is wired their own way.
I'm a,
some people are wired towards blondes.</v>

1011
01:09:40.270 --> 01:09:43.090
It's a big women's skinny women,
various authenticity

1012
01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:47.490
<v 4>ethnicities.
I'm not sure that's the words or</v>

1013
01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:52.950
z.
It's not dessert.
Nativities Burt's

1014
01:09:55.290 --> 01:09:56.030
wire.

1015
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:59.030
<v 13>So authenticity is,
I'm wired towards older women</v>

1016
01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.250
babyface.
Kyle Jones has never dated a woman.

1017
01:10:04.251 --> 01:10:07.350
He's own h prefabbing relationships with

1018
01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:13.780
<v 4>mouth open mouth.
God,
this lady,
how will you think she is?</v>

1019
01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:15.820
But she's really old.

1020
01:10:16.090 --> 01:10:20.710
She looks like she's 90 she looks at her mouth is fully open.

1021
01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:25.120
His tongue.
Oh,
that is kind of like a lizard tongue.

1022
01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:29.780
It looks like he's trying to save her life right now.
It looks like CPR.

1023
01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:36.553
<v 13>Staci</v>

1024
01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:43.330
romances grandma's in the seventies eighties and even nineties

1025
01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:49.620
<v 4>oof,
Bro.
I mean I'm all about everybody getting some,
but that's</v>

1026
01:10:51.970 --> 01:10:55.440
not 90 on.
Yeah,
it makes us decker.
I bet.

1027
01:10:55.530 --> 01:10:58.680
I know his dicta hangs below his balls or his balls at Henkel though.
His Dick

1028
01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:03.670
<v 13>when I first met cow.
Quite thrilled.
It's very flattering devs</v>

1029
01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:09.150
and he was a very nice,
I sometimes I feel like he's,

1030
01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:14.580
<v 4>that's not helping the bed.
I,
yeah,</v>

1031
01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:17.160
that's kind of not the right analogy.

1032
01:11:17.161 --> 01:11:19.920
Or He's like my son that I fuck.

1033
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.520
It's kind of grows trying to think what it would take for me to fuck this woman.

1034
01:11:23.550 --> 01:11:25.320
All right,
let's talk about it.
Let's do it.

1035
01:11:26.050 --> 01:11:30.900
What would it take time could it take?
That's what I'm saying.
Take the real,

1036
01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:35.850
how do you get it up?
Well,
I'd have to have a mask on so I can't see her.

1037
01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:39.450
Like I have to,
you have to put other visuals in front of me.

1038
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:42.930
You'd wear the mask or you put a mask on her?
No,

1039
01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:47.300
I would put a virtual reality mask on me so I could see something else.

1040
01:11:47.310 --> 01:11:50.670
Totally cheating.
And that negates the whole project and do it.
I mean,

1041
01:11:50.671 --> 01:11:54.390
she's got a smell like diarrhea.
She's probably,
she smells,
you know,

1042
01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:58.110
old and Shitty.
They all smell.
Then she looks like she smokes,

1043
01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:04.080
so I don't know.
Well,
she used to smoke her teeth look good for 91.

1044
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:09.300
Yeah.
They don't look that bad,
but she also looks like a guy.
Right.
You know,

1045
01:12:09.570 --> 01:12:12.000
like if you just go like,
Hey,
what do you see there?

1046
01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:18.150
I know you're saying like a nice old man.
Like uh,

1047
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:22.350
yeah,
like Dolph Lundgren.
A little what?

1048
01:12:24.670 --> 01:12:27.700
Oh,
just thinking of it like a guy at a sandwich shop.
You know who's like,

1049
01:12:27.701 --> 01:12:29.550
you want,
you want mustard on that?
What do you want?

1050
01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:35.160
It looks like to me it would be really,
really something to just say like,

1051
01:12:35.161 --> 01:12:38.040
Hey,
just go perform.
I think if you were just like,
don't,
if you,

1052
01:12:38.041 --> 01:12:42.090
if you would go abstain for a month,

1053
01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:45.330
so you're just reel back now juiced up and then,

1054
01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:49.860
and then you just have her like you go,
I'll just close my eyes and hey,

1055
01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:53.940
but her,
her Bologna doesn't feel the same.
Oh my God.

1056
01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:57.750
It's all loose.
Can you,

1057
01:12:57.780 --> 01:13:01.650
what do you think her meow is like at that age?
Oh my God.
Being serious.

1058
01:13:01.651 --> 01:13:04.860
What happens to the fucking desert on the planet?

1059
01:13:04.890 --> 01:13:09.540
It's so bad and hanging.
It's not good.
Nothing's good.

1060
01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:13.090
Do you think they have pubes to old people have fallout?
Yeah,

1061
01:13:13.190 --> 01:13:16.890
but there's only a few left,
so she's probably like,
do like the bald post,
but

1062
01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:23.820
it's a lot.
She's really,
she's 90 so gnarly dude.

1063
01:13:23.850 --> 01:13:27.750
I mean I want to like bring her a cup of tea or something,
but just so frail too.

1064
01:13:27.751 --> 01:13:32.570
It's,
it's not even safe for her,
isn't,
it?
Doesn't feel like it went,
Dude.
Whoa.

1065
01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:37.360
He's unusual.
Tasting women is too extreme.
Kyle takes a different view.

1066
01:13:37.670 --> 01:13:41.090
People to think of their parents or grandparents having sex for the other.

1067
01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:45.540
They just don't do that.
Yes,
they do.
One,
some of them have throw up.

1068
01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:49.400
Yeah.
Well I'm glad he exists these days.
Getting out of it.

1069
01:13:49.470 --> 01:13:53.700
He was someone that Dick around a lot of old ladies,
which I guess is nice.
Well,

1070
01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:58.980
she's actually really put together for a 91 91 she walks hunched over,

1071
01:14:00.810 --> 01:14:04.170
she looks like she's
getting all this young,

1072
01:14:05.370 --> 01:14:06.870
young d.
There you go.

1073
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:10.770
What do you mean there you go and you get nice and old bounce on one of these

1074
01:14:10.771 --> 01:14:12.190
young days.
He got

1075
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:16.180
<v 2>it
from a young age.</v>

1076
01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:20.860
Kyle realized the pinups,
which were exciting.
His friends won't catch in his eye.

1077
01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:21.200
<v 13>Well,</v>

1078
01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:25.160
the first time I realized all of a sudden the older woman probably was 12 or 13

1079
01:14:25.161 --> 01:14:26.260
years old.
Really?
What's funny,

1080
01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:30.230
the things that they're self conscious about is what I'm into.
I like lions.

1081
01:14:30.231 --> 01:14:34.010
I like the neck feature.
You know,
women worry about their boobs saggy.

1082
01:14:34.050 --> 01:14:38.490
I think the natural hang looks great fan of platinum.
Erin.
Oh,
I can say gray.

1083
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:40.640
I guess I'm platinum on the fan.
I'm glad I'm here.

1084
01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:45.230
<v 2>Got To keep this guy's number.
No.
How do I get it?
What's his last name?
All right.</v>

1085
01:14:46.050 --> 01:14:50.220
Just in case.
Should,
yeah,
you get die before me.
Husbands always do.

1086
01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:53.400
I got a call up fucking Kyle or whatever his name.
She'll be old by then.

1087
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:57.120
You've got to find a new Kyle.
That's the beauty of the Internet,
man.
Yeah.

1088
01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:59.850
There's always some lunatic out there.
Then wants to bang a 90 year old,
old,

1089
01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:02.460
old fucking my regular I suppose up there.
Yeah.

1090
01:15:02.490 --> 01:15:07.290
My bald regularly slobbery ready when back when he doesn't talk like,

1091
01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:11.460
no,
not doing an impression of you all

1092
01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:17.850
take your teeth out.

1093
01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:27.630
You came in where I worked or buy something that I know my phone number gave me

1094
01:15:29.041 --> 01:15:34.041
his and then every day you dropped me on the phone until we finally went out.

1095
01:15:35.250 --> 01:15:39.510
It makes you feel wonderful dating somebody younger than you.
Yeah,

1096
01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:43.940
I'm sure it does.
It makes you feel alive again.
It's hard to watch as a kid.

1097
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:47.850
The hard part's wonderful.
Oh,
I am a south.
Hey.

1098
01:15:47.851 --> 01:15:50.860
Amazes me and I like it.

1099
01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:56.520
Oh God,
the kissing was the hardest thing to watch with these ads.

1100
01:15:57.170 --> 01:16:01.500
I just can't imagine that picture.
How much she smells.
I know.
No,

1101
01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:06.290
like the mouth.
It's an old mouse.
Yeah.
It's one of those.
Or they like ha ha ha.

1102
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:10.010
And you feel that hot air leaving smell really bad.

1103
01:16:10.011 --> 01:16:11.620
What does her box smelling do?

1104
01:16:11.670 --> 01:16:15.260
Imagine I buy arms to settle down.

1105
01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:20.330
Kyle isn't monogamous and enjoy stating several women at the same time.
Yeah.

1106
01:16:20.331 --> 01:16:24.310
God bless your soul.
He meant 68 year old.
Great Grandmother.
Great.

1107
01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:28.160
Two years ago on a dating website.
First contacted me.

1108
01:16:28.161 --> 01:16:31.130
I did question is a nice tick tattoo was twice

1109
01:16:31.930 --> 01:16:36.680
<v 13>when we had dinner.
I liked him.
I felt at ease with them.</v>

1110
01:16:36.710 --> 01:16:39.830
So she's uh,
I started seeing them trailer

1111
01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:42.720
<v 2>trash for sure.
Oh yeah.
That's a tattoo.
Yeah.</v>

1112
01:16:42.721 --> 01:16:45.810
It doesn't look good when you're 71 savage woman.

1113
01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:52.440
He's a savage too.
No,
she is.
She is.
No,
he's the savage.

1114
01:16:54.150 --> 01:16:57.930
She is.
She's a great grandmother.
She's 68.

1115
01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:03.120
She needs love too.
Yeah,
she's,
she's a fucking psycho.

1116
01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:04.830
He's the cycle.

1117
01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.180
<v 13>Keller people sometimes that are hard core.</v>

1118
01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:12.490
What I do for me in the the on the ball chart on your after money here after a

1119
01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:15.820
heritage.
I hear that all the time.
It's not sure what all,
um,

1120
01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:18.020
I do this because I like it and they like it too.

1121
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:22.100
<v 2>He's got no Vogel,
blah,
Blah.
I'll add up.</v>

1122
01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:29.030
It's a,
it's tough to understand.
Yeah.
It's tough and I mean,

1123
01:17:29.031 --> 01:17:32.900
this chick,
Jesus,
it's tough.
These moms,

1124
01:17:32.901 --> 01:17:37.040
Cecelia fairly supports his romantic choices that would mix.

1125
01:17:37.041 --> 01:17:38.300
It took some getting used to,

1126
01:17:38.530 --> 01:17:42.870
<v 13>yeah.
First Time Kylie brought home a girlfriend,</v>

1127
01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:46.790
they your mother's 22 she's much better looking,
be

1128
01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:53.230
a young woman back then.
I still feel like,

1129
01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:58.660
<v 2>oh,
she was like,
wait,
wait,
play poking at me,
bitch.
Well,
here's the good news.</v>

1130
01:17:58.930 --> 01:18:03.010
At least her son is not going to knock up some girl and ruin his life.
Right.

1131
01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:09.540
That's true.
That's the big plus there.
Yeah.
What?

1132
01:18:09.541 --> 01:18:12.400
What can go wrong?
You know?
Actually this is a win win for him.

1133
01:18:12.670 --> 01:18:15.640
These broads do die.
Leave him money.
It's great.

1134
01:18:15.641 --> 01:18:18.280
He's doing a great service for them.
Sure.
Who's it hurting?

1135
01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:21.850
Just on us to watch it.
They could probably die while they're doing it.

1136
01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:25.780
That's probably,
yes.
Yeah,
yeah.
He's probably going to witness a lot of death.

1137
01:18:26.010 --> 01:18:29.700
Yeah.
Or have like a lot of imagine it.

1138
01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:34.450
A lot of people you dated died in a certain,
oh,
isn't that sad?
Well,
yeah.

1139
01:18:34.451 --> 01:18:36.550
I'm saying like for him it can be like,
Hey,

1140
01:18:36.551 --> 01:18:41.530
I'm remember last decade when those 30 girls you dated died

1141
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:46.720
and someone was like,
wait,
what?
And he's like,
oh,
I did.
Oh yeah.
Really old people.

1142
01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:51.900
But still,
they all die within a few years even I it,

1143
01:18:52.010 --> 01:18:52.360
yeah.

1144
01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:57.010
I saw a documentary about old people in a retirement community and they talk

1145
01:18:57.011 --> 01:19:00.700
about how sometimes they don't even want to make new friends because they're

1146
01:19:00.701 --> 01:19:04.350
going to die.
You're gonna die or why?
Why bother with it?
Uh,
relationships,

1147
01:19:04.351 --> 01:19:06.190
a great outlook on life.
I agree.

1148
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:10.750
My whole thing about leading people and I agree and stop loving people.
You know,

1149
01:19:10.751 --> 01:19:14.310
it's so funny.
It's like,
I think about when you're going to die.
Yeah.

1150
01:19:14.830 --> 01:19:17.260
And I was just saying about that last night,
how was like,
you know,

1151
01:19:17.290 --> 01:19:19.240
I don't really,
if he dies,

1152
01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:22.980
I'm not going to try to like go out and find another day.

1153
01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:25.960
Like fuck it.
Like cares,

1154
01:19:25.961 --> 01:19:30.480
who cares if I'm old and wrinkly and fucking fat,
you know?
Serious.

1155
01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:34.760
Yeah.
What am I going to do?
Find another husband and do all this.
It got old.

1156
01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:40.330
No Way.
Why I just fine now I just be alone.

1157
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:44.910
I mean it's a nice,
it's a fantasy.
Obviously I lose myself in like three hours.

1158
01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:47.350
Yeah.
Like a lot of times I'm like,
Oh,

1159
01:19:47.351 --> 01:19:49.470
you found the stares of what happens next week.
You know,

1160
01:19:49.570 --> 01:19:51.520
that kind of thing where I'd be like,
Oh,
you know,

1161
01:19:51.521 --> 01:19:52.750
you do the funeral and it's like,

1162
01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:55.870
and you're laughing the whole time you're on Tinder.

1163
01:19:55.871 --> 01:19:59.800
At the funeral I always pictured too,
like,
you know,
like the day you die,

1164
01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:02.130
just cleaning out your closet,
like throwing everything out.
Like right.

1165
01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:07.090
I got all this room now hanging up new shirts and then,
yeah.
And then,

1166
01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:08.040
you

1167
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.010
<v 4>know,
showing the place to people like,
Hey,
look all this space,</v>

1168
01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:14.970
I got to hours to a new wife.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well you get a new wife to replace me.

1169
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.440
Well,
I think you date right away.

1170
01:20:16.441 --> 01:20:20.940
I think they always say like strike while the irons hot.
So like I'll be like,

1171
01:20:20.970 --> 01:20:25.870
Ooh,
I'm needy.
You know?
I think that's enticing.
Broken bird.
Yeah.

1172
01:20:25.871 --> 01:20:30.120
The broken wing.
Someone's going to want to rescue.
Yup.
Okay.

1173
01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:35.310
So I dunno.
I think,
I think basically dirt goes on the casket and you go,

1174
01:20:35.311 --> 01:20:39.120
I'm single.
Yeah.
That kind of thing.
Good for you.

1175
01:20:39.930 --> 01:20:42.120
How's that working for you?
I will see.
How's it working?

1176
01:20:42.121 --> 01:20:46.110
It's not gonna work for you when make haunt your house and your dreams.

1177
01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:51.380
You're fighting on fucking with you.
I'm like,
Hey Tom,

1178
01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:55.470
this is fucking bitch in my bed.
I could see doing that.
Yeah,
of course.

1179
01:20:55.471 --> 01:20:59.490
I will keep her away from my kid asshole.
Yeah.

1180
01:21:01.010 --> 01:21:01.790
Okay.

1181
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:02.151
<v 2>Um,</v>

1182
01:21:02.151 --> 01:21:07.130
I've asked Kelly why he prefers older women and you tell me because the older

1183
01:21:07.131 --> 01:21:09.320
women are there,

1184
01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:13.130
they're more mature and now there's somebody who can actually sit down and talk

1185
01:21:13.131 --> 01:21:16.250
to,
that's what he likes.
He's not hurting your body.

1186
01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:20.360
I don't think that it's really anybody's business.
Well let me ask you,

1187
01:21:20.361 --> 01:21:23.990
what do you think he has in common with a 91 year old?
He is,

1188
01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:26.720
well how old is Kyle here?
30 maybe something like that.

1189
01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:31.730
She was born in 1900 and this guy wants to have,

1190
01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:35.660
you know what I'm saying?
She's born in 1912 then.
Okay.

1191
01:21:36.450 --> 01:21:41.420
I cause I don't do it
to man.
When is she born?
She's 91.
Let's see,

1192
01:21:41.421 --> 01:21:45.680
28 she was born in 1927.

1193
01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.450
Jesus Christ.

1194
01:21:47.451 --> 01:21:51.580
So in 1927 they didn't have to,

1195
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:56.330
they even have cars back then.
Yeah,
the model t she drove a model t around,

1196
01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:00.520
didn't even have penicillin or soap.
She's seen the whole world.

1197
01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:04.130
That's what I'm saying.
There's bitches,
they have nothing in common.

1198
01:22:04.131 --> 01:22:07.340
Their worlds are so different and she sees lightening cause I want to turn the

1199
01:22:07.341 --> 01:22:10.260
lights on that.

1200
01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:19.650
<v 4>Yeah,
totally different worlds.</v>

1201
01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:23.140
He's just sitting there eating that old fucking ass and box.
Can we,

1202
01:22:23.141 --> 01:22:25.740
let's go onto the next topic.
He can't do this anymore.

1203
01:22:26.670 --> 01:22:29.730
It's too depressing the making out.
It's too much to watch.

1204
01:22:29.731 --> 01:22:33.390
Watch 1927 man,

1205
01:22:34.710 --> 01:22:37.740
we got a female.

1206
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:43.310
Somebody wrote in about the cookie thief last interesting.

1207
01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:48.960
And because I still have not cracked the case well here,
this might help you.

1208
01:22:49.690 --> 01:22:53.850
So as I think the bigger issue of the cookie thief saga is that Christina was

1209
01:22:53.851 --> 01:22:58.851
hiding to cookies in her purse with absolutely no intention of sharing either

1210
01:23:00.061 --> 01:23:02.170
one of them with her family wrapping

1211
01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:06.550
<v 2>a selfish asshole.
Wow.</v>

1212
01:23:06.610 --> 01:23:11.020
Bravo.
Oh Wow.
First of all,
American.
First of all,
you do,

1213
01:23:11.021 --> 01:23:11.854
you have a good point.

1214
01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:15.580
I had just gotten those cookies as a gift from uncle Dave the night before.

1215
01:23:15.610 --> 01:23:17.830
I didn't even have a chance.
We got home late that night.

1216
01:23:17.831 --> 01:23:20.500
We put baby jeans to bed and we collapsed into bed.

1217
01:23:20.501 --> 01:23:23.890
And the next morning that that was eight in the morning that I notice a cookie

1218
01:23:23.891 --> 01:23:27.160
thief has truck.
So there was no time to even share.

1219
01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:29.230
So the cookie thief got in there.

1220
01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:34.030
I don't even know how he knew or she knew I had cookies in there.
How,

1221
01:23:34.031 --> 01:23:36.490
how did the cookie thief know that they were even in there?

1222
01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:38.520
<v 10>I don't know.</v>

1223
01:23:39.630 --> 01:23:42.350
<v 2>I was always over here.
Thank you.</v>

1224
01:23:42.351 --> 01:23:47.351
Snuck in his real name to ban,

1225
01:23:49.330 --> 01:23:54.290
<v 10>uh,
uh,
time for the cookie thief or whatever.
I don't know.
But again,</v>

1226
01:23:54.291 --> 01:23:56.780
it's a real interesting,
interesting.

1227
01:23:57.140 --> 01:24:01.040
And I ate the other one.
It was really good.

1228
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:06.380
Let me see.
It was a wedding cookie from Cincinnati.
Some special company,

1229
01:24:06.381 --> 01:24:09.170
right?
It's like a special cookie was,
yeah.
Yeah.
Really good.

1230
01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:12.230
Here's another bit of Fan Mail.
Hey,

1231
01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:15.290
Mommy's asked my wife to the day if she wanted to hear a really funny fart and

1232
01:24:15.291 --> 01:24:17.990
she said,
no,
nope.
That happened.
She said,

1233
01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:21.950
how did you know it was going to be funny?
And I said,
all farts are funny.

1234
01:24:22.190 --> 01:24:25.400
We laughed and laughed.
Thanks for the podcast,
Arnie.

1235
01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:28.790
It's a family show.
Oh yeah.

1236
01:24:28.791 --> 01:24:31.280
I got my double pipe classic in the mail yesterday and love it.

1237
01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:34.190
You are not lying.
It's very soft and comfy.
Wore it today.

1238
01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:36.260
Nobody knew what it meant but I did.

1239
01:24:36.290 --> 01:24:40.460
That's the thing was I was asking people at shows and Cincy that wore them.

1240
01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:43.430
I go is anybody asking you what that is?

1241
01:24:43.431 --> 01:24:46.340
Cause I want to hear stories of someone being like,
hey what is that?

1242
01:24:46.850 --> 01:24:48.100
And someone being like,
you know when you

1243
01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:52.790
<v 2>fart and Burp at the same time.
I want to hear those.</v>

1244
01:24:52.791 --> 01:24:54.830
Sounds like a really good commercial for it.
Yeah man.

1245
01:24:54.890 --> 01:24:56.210
What is a double pipe classic?

1246
01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:59.510
Well funny you should ask even a bourbon farther the same time

1247
01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:02.800
<v 10>somebody,
oh listen to this.</v>

1248
01:25:03.390 --> 01:25:08.390
The poop bag pillowcase story that was told in the last episode was also

1249
01:25:08.411 --> 01:25:12.460
represent,
was also referenced in Episode 19 Oh my goodness.

1250
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:17.680
The validity of hearing the same Brown story twice helps me trust Tommy's poop

1251
01:25:17.681 --> 01:25:18.514
pile story.

1252
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:22.720
It makes me sad that the runner up to the water champion doesn't believe her

1253
01:25:22.721 --> 01:25:23.080
main.

1254
01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:26.770
<v 2>Oh my God.
First of all,
I need to start going through the ANA.
Thank you Hannah.</v>

1255
01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:30.610
Because somebody is selecting them kind of a biased way.

1256
01:25:30.730 --> 01:25:33.730
It's interesting how the bias is towards everything that's coming in.

1257
01:25:33.731 --> 01:25:38.320
I'm just passing along.
Sure,
sure.
And he's just selecting the ones to read.

1258
01:25:38.620 --> 01:25:41.980
Interesting.
These are in there and Tra blue Bam.
Put them in there.

1259
01:25:43.330 --> 01:25:45.970
Now,
just because one story is accurate,

1260
01:25:45.971 --> 01:25:49.930
the pillowcase doesn't mean the poo pile is accurate.
Poop piles accurate?

1261
01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:54.370
It is not.
You've changed the details.
I haven't since the last time.

1262
01:25:54.371 --> 01:25:58.780
When your advisor,
you're the liar.
You keep calling me a liar.

1263
01:25:58.930 --> 01:25:59.950
You're liar.
What did,

1264
01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:04.370
I came home yesterday and you've got these two on your thumbs.

1265
01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:08.530
Okay.
And I go,
what happened to your thumbs?
Yeah,

1266
01:26:10.190 --> 01:26:15.050
I go,
what happened to your thens?
You Go,
oh yeah,
one night.
Some eye,

1267
01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:19.640
some guide.
Dare me to jump over a parking meter and I couldn't do it.

1268
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:23.450
And the payment for not being able to do it was that he got to put two

1269
01:26:23.451 --> 01:26:26.570
cigarettes out on my thumbs.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1270
01:26:26.571 --> 01:26:30.950
And I knew immediately that you're allying liar face.
Who Wise?

1271
01:26:31.190 --> 01:26:34.870
Because I've fucking seen cigarette burns from highschool.

1272
01:26:34.930 --> 01:26:37.730
I'd dumb friends that would put out cigarettes on their arms and I know what

1273
01:26:37.731 --> 01:26:41.510
they look like and they take weeks to heal and they puss and it's a really

1274
01:26:41.511 --> 01:26:46.220
gnarly,
no,
you only in Cincinnati for like four days,

1275
01:26:46.221 --> 01:26:49.130
Babe.
Wednesday night when I got there,
I go,
yeah,

1276
01:26:49.690 --> 01:26:53.240
but you can jump over this parking meter.
And I go,
yeah,
I can.

1277
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:57.080
There's so much wrong with the story.
Well,
if you can't,

1278
01:26:57.190 --> 01:27:01.040
I'm gonna put these cigarettes out on you twice.
And I go,
all right,
man.

1279
01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:04.640
And I slid off the top.
I just didn't clear it by like a millimeter.

1280
01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:08.060
And then he put two cigarettes out on my right there.

1281
01:27:08.210 --> 01:27:12.260
Here's what's wrong with the story.
Number one,
you've never leapt,

1282
01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:15.460
jumped or skip it,
skip it.

1283
01:27:15.461 --> 01:27:18.410
A rinky dink over a parking meter in your life.

1284
01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:23.120
You've seen a photo of me doing it as a joke for a headshot when you were like

1285
01:27:23.121 --> 01:27:27.500
20 the photographer made you do it to make you look exciting and interesting

1286
01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:30.770
because in real life he would never,

1287
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:35.890
never volunteered to do this thing.
Of course.
Got to find this.

1288
01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:40.610
It's a horrible photo.
It's so stupid and you look so dumb doing it.

1289
01:27:40.611 --> 01:27:44.120
Yeah.
So embarrassing.
So first of all,

1290
01:27:44.121 --> 01:27:47.930
that part of the story I knew immediately it was a big lie because he never leap

1291
01:27:47.931 --> 01:27:52.220
or jump over anything.
And number two,
I know what a cigarette burn it looks like.

1292
01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:55.700
Well and number three,
he put it out twice.
Okay.

1293
01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:02.780
Did Not hurt a lot.
Cat House was there so he saw it.

1294
01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:05.570
Well let's,
let's ask him then to verify your story.

1295
01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:09.810
We'll see if we can get them on the phone.
Okay,
let's see.
Um,

1296
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:13.730
I know you're lying.
Just like you're lying about the poop pile story.

1297
01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:15.440
That story wasn't true either.

1298
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:19.490
There's a lot of facts that don't fit your profile.
Like what?

1299
01:28:19.970 --> 01:28:22.950
Jumping over anything,
I've never seen you jump over anything.

1300
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.500
You would split your pants and a second
it's not true.

1301
01:28:29.330 --> 01:28:33.640
Not True.
And so who who dared you to job is another part of the story.

1302
01:28:33.641 --> 01:28:37.070
The hotel.
This dude,
it just,
some guy was like,
hey Tom,

1303
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:41.540
I feel like a little city.
It's a little,
Cincinnati is a little said no.

1304
01:28:41.541 --> 01:28:45.230
The where the comp,
where the hotel is.
And then some stranger.

1305
01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:48.590
Hey guys.
Hey Dude.
Yeah,

1306
01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:52.270
it's just some guy and you let some guy to cigarettes,

1307
01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:56.930
you know we were a little,
we're a little bit,
little toasty.

1308
01:28:57.860 --> 01:29:01.830
That's another part of the story that doesn't add up.
Why?
Because you don't,

1309
01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:03.150
you sell them.
Get

1310
01:29:05.210 --> 01:29:09.450
so one time I've seen you shit house drunk enough to do something that done.

1311
01:29:09.451 --> 01:29:13.880
Yeah.
Was that your 23rd birthday party?

1312
01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:17.520
20 friends when you were so drunk you were jumping rope in the bar?
Yeah.

1313
01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:22.850
And they had to kick you out.
And that's the one time
does it.

1314
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:25.580
This call has been forwarded.
Okay,

1315
01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:28.970
well that's him Pat House on and he'll tell this bullshit story.

1316
01:29:30.230 --> 01:29:33.830
Please.
Ah Man,

1317
01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:37.370
you never accept dares for anything.
This would be,

1318
01:29:37.371 --> 01:29:42.080
so that's why they're being a little f it up,
you know,
helped.

1319
01:29:43.190 --> 01:29:46.080
It helped me.
It don't buy it.
You never get fucked up for Nadar.

1320
01:29:46.110 --> 01:29:49.910
If you've blue man,
you've been on the road with my husband,

1321
01:29:49.911 --> 01:29:54.830
how wasted does he get every night?
Not every night,

1322
01:29:54.831 --> 01:29:58.200
but you know,
I'd say like once every couple of times.
Again,
you got slow,

1323
01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:03.280
hammered enough to jump over a parking meter and all smiling and stuff.

1324
01:30:04.671 --> 01:30:07.340
You could tell he's fucked up.
Yes.
Smiling.
So that's how I know you're lying.

1325
01:30:07.490 --> 01:30:08.930
Number one.
That's how you're lying.

1326
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:12.500
You don't get smiley and stuff and you don't act out when you're messed up.
No,

1327
01:30:12.501 --> 01:30:16.730
I've only seen him drunk.
I haven't seen him toasty.
Okay.
Okay.
By the way,

1328
01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:22.010
whenever you're toasty are drunk,
you go down.
You never go up.

1329
01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:26.680
Me.
Yeah,
I go down.
Yeah,
her look at,
yeah,

1330
01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:31.460
I know you bro.
What do I do?
You chill.
You get,

1331
01:30:31.461 --> 01:30:36.060
you get more quiet and withdrawn and no,
you're not fun.
That's the whole,

1332
01:30:36.450 --> 01:30:41.450
thank God you're not a fun person to be around even when you're

1333
01:30:45.190 --> 01:30:45.720
done.

1334
01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:50.680
That's why I know this is such a fucking lie because you're not fun and you

1335
01:30:50.681 --> 01:30:54.420
don't do fun.
Things like jump over parking meters.
I know this about,

1336
01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:57.910
I'm not a fun place.
It's not neither of mine.
That's why we're married.

1337
01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:02.530
We don't like having fun.
It's rude,

1338
01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:07.450
really rude.
It's not rude.
I'm no fun either.
I like to do stuff.

1339
01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:11.270
Everyone knows that.
Oh my God.
God.
All right.

1340
01:31:12.730 --> 01:31:13.563
<v 7>Aw.
Schedule</v>

1341
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:31.210
being on video games.

1342
01:31:33.090 --> 01:31:35.570
We were talking about announcers,

1343
01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:48.620
a video

1344
01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:53.320

Yeah,

Wow.

1345
01:31:53.330 --> 01:31:57.020

Huh?
Well,
I think they just really love this shit.

1346
01:31:57.050 --> 01:32:00.190
I mean there's a whole,
that's a whole league.
Now you the video game leads,
right?

1347
01:32:00.780 --> 01:32:02.020
<v 4>Oh yeah.
It's really big.</v>

1348
01:32:02.050 --> 01:32:06.940
And they play in arenas and people go and watch it on the big fucking deal.

1349
01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:10.360
Players out like six figure salary.
Okay.
This is more right.

1350
01:32:10.361 --> 01:32:14.440
We're done with seven figure.
Yeah.
Human race is fucking dying.
This is it.

1351
01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:18.430
Diseasers ams the the championship.

1352
01:32:22.610 --> 01:32:27.400
<v 10>What the fuck is that?
Oh,

Okay.
All right.</v>

1353
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:28.743
Um,

1354

Nope,

No,</v>

1358
01:32:45.450 --> 01:32:49.890
I'm in the club now.
Part bear like,
I'm about to have a lot of doors open.
Okay.

1359
01:32:49.891 --> 01:32:51.750
Here we go.
I'm so nervous.

1360
01:32:51.930 --> 01:32:56.400
I am 0.3% Jewish.
Why?

1361
01:32:56.910 --> 01:33:00.690
Yes.
Ashkenazi Jew.
Wow.

1362
01:33:00.810 --> 01:33:05.370

You're so lucky you're going to,

1363
01:33:05.371 --> 01:33:08.880

1365
01:33:12.661 --> 01:33:16.080
I know you've been fucking leaving clothes.
Yeah.
And uh,

1366
01:33:16.650 --> 01:33:20.430

1367
01:33:20.431 --> 01:33:23.870
started telling people like a lot of guys were like,
oh well you cannot,

1368

1369
01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:32.120
It's like,

it's been pretty awesome.
Yeah.

1370
01:33:32.130 --> 01:33:36.630
Jonah hill 0.3% but it's there.
I didn't know that.

1371
01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:40.170
That's really exciting.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
Yeah,

1372
01:33:40.171 --> 01:33:41.880
I feel like we clicked a lot more of this week to,

1373
01:33:42.910 --> 01:33:47.490
well it can be a head this for me by the way,
blue band was like,
well you know,

1374
01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:52.720
I meant to tell you something about the connection.

1375
01:33:53.341 --> 01:33:57.770
I feel closer and I was like,
oh,

1376
01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:02.160
okay.
Wow.
Does he eat jelly stuff in front of you?

1377
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:06.860
Matzoh balls.
Yeah.
Do you like most ball and so lox and bagels in front of Tom.

1378
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.020
<v 14>I like locks but I love slot on eat them in front of Tom.
Is that Oh yeah,</v>

1379
01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:14.860
actually at the airport.
Uh,
Pat House saw me do something very Jewish.

1380
01:34:14.861 --> 01:34:18.430
I put all my change into that bucket before you go into security.
Yeah.

1381
01:34:18.730 --> 01:34:23.730
And then I just dumped everything into my hand and pat like I turned and pat is

1382
01:34:24.011 --> 01:34:25.720
looking right at me and I was like,

1383
01:34:25.721 --> 01:34:29.110
this is the most Jewish thing I've done in like a year.
Wait.

1384
01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:31.280
And she kept your change or the way you look,

1385
01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:33.610
you need to take everything out of your pockets when you go through security.

1386
01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:36.780
Yeah,
like everything.
So I had like all the change from the weekend.
Right.

1387
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:38.860
It's like I put my belt on it,

1388
01:34:38.861 --> 01:34:42.050
put my wallet in and then the last thing is the change and there's so much you

1389
01:34:42.051 --> 01:34:46.330
have to pick it up and dump it into my hand.
And you were like every coin,

1390
01:34:46.510 --> 01:34:49.940
every super self aware.
When I didn't do anything super juice.

1391
01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:52.300
<v 4>Do you really?
Do you really?
You do?</v>

1392
01:34:52.850 --> 01:34:56.420
<v 14>Yeah.
Like us.
Jews or Jews?
Uh,
we're very aware.</v>

1393
01:34:56.421 --> 01:34:58.370
I remember I was to haggle something

1394
01:34:58.700 --> 01:34:59.533
<v 2>when,
uh,</v>

1395
01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:02.900
I was at some swap meet with my friend and I'm trying to bargain the price and I

1396
01:35:02.901 --> 01:35:05.090
just hear my friends sign behind me.
Like,

1397
01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:09.350
I can't believe you're actually doing this.
They totally fucked up my deal.

1398
01:35:09.351 --> 01:35:13.820
I had to come back the next day.
Really?
Wow.
Interesting.
Well,
it's a whole,

1399
01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:16.480
it's like new stuff for me to be subconscious.
Yeah.

1400
01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:19.650
And like when I started doing that,
I'll be like,
eh,
Jewish.
You,

1401
01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:22.450
we're ready to hit your self hating Jew.
Yeah.

1402
01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:27.290
And also your nose is kind of Jewish.
No,
I'm serious.
Look at it.

1403
01:35:27.291 --> 01:35:31.010
What the fuck are you and blue man have a similar knows now that I look,

1404
01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:34.330
let's post a photograph.
If we can have the two profiles here.

1405
01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:37.160
Look how juicy you are.
Now that I look at you,

1406
01:35:37.161 --> 01:35:39.770
your lips are too large and you've got,
where's that?

1407
01:35:39.771 --> 01:35:43.180
I wish we had that drawing of the exemplary Jew from that hateful girls.

1408
01:35:43.390 --> 01:35:46.150
<v 4>Oh yeah.
Um,
well there's a photo right there.</v>

1409
01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:50.670
<v 2>Yeah.
See how kind of,
you can't really tell,
but there's like a hump there.</v>

1410
01:35:50.671 --> 01:35:53.730
He's us.
Your lips are big.
No racist.

1411
01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:58.670
Your hair's really curly or than it's ever been.
Okay.
That's really interesting.

1412
01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:05.660
<v 7>A couple of drinks.</v>

1413
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:06.833
<v 2>The top layer,
right?</v>

1414
01:36:07.670 --> 01:36:08.503
<v 7>Did she ask</v>

1415
01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:18.920
the urine
to my bunk?

1416
01:36:19.730 --> 01:36:22.940
All lists or sex with your sister?

1417
01:36:25.610 --> 01:36:28.250
Grandmother walks on you masturbating.

1418
01:36:29.010 --> 01:36:30.860
Never have another orgasm

1419
01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:35.360
is trying to play.
Would you rather?

1420
01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:41.753
Right.

1421
01:36:43.220 --> 01:36:46.100
<v 4>That's a great one.
Is that by Ali?
I did that.
I'm not sure.</v>

1422
01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:47.961
What'd you rather have?

1423
01:36:47.961 --> 01:36:51.530
An internal and external hemorrhoid or grow ingrown toenails on both your big

1424
01:36:51.531 --> 01:36:54.240
totes that are also infected.
Ooh.

1425
01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:57.260
Where do you want pain and you asshole or your feet?

1426
01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:01.400
It was basically the question.
That's it.
A simple way of doing it.

1427
01:37:01.401 --> 01:37:04.230
Do you want your toes or your ass holder hurt all the time and,

1428
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:08.360
but you know what's real sneaky about fingers and toes.
Is that when those hurt,

1429
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:10.640
those really hurt?
Yeah.
You ever had any,

1430
01:37:10.670 --> 01:37:14.450
when you pull out the hangnail and went right,
I had one that got so infected.

1431
01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:17.930
You can't sleep at night if it's like throbbing in pain.
Oh,
I know.

1432
01:37:17.931 --> 01:37:22.880
There's a lot of pro athletes that have had their careers derailed by tow

1433
01:37:22.881 --> 01:37:26.810
injuries.
People don't really,
yeah,
sure.
Because if it's that bad,

1434
01:37:26.811 --> 01:37:29.150
if your big toe is,
you know,

1435
01:37:29.450 --> 01:37:32.570
you get turf toe or broken or something like that,
you know,

1436
01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:35.720
you can't push off of it.
You can't run,
you can't jump,
you can't do anything.

1437
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:39.360
Right.
You're just in pain.
Wow.
What do you think?
What do you go for it?
Yeah,

1438
01:37:39.390 --> 01:37:42.680
go for it.
I've had hemorrhoids so since I was pregnant and you know,

1439
01:37:42.681 --> 01:37:46.750
you don't really feel them until at least I didn't until I had to go brown.
Yeah.

1440
01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:49.520
And I was wiping,
I remember wiping was like,

1441
01:37:51.110 --> 01:37:53.870
but then now with this bid day,
I mean,
yeah,

1442
01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:58.290
kind of by the change that I don't know,
we'll figure it out.
Um,

1443
01:37:58.650 --> 01:38:02.910
but I would go for the hem rights because that's only once a day or twice a day

1444
01:38:02.911 --> 01:38:04.260
when you're dumping like normal people,

1445
01:38:04.261 --> 01:38:07.380
not like you where you should every 15 minutes.
No.

1446
01:38:07.381 --> 01:38:11.730
I also have like I have a fear of the,
of the toe injuries and stuff.

1447
01:38:11.731 --> 01:38:15.270
So I think I would go,
I already have asphalt,
like excitement every day.

1448
01:38:15.690 --> 01:38:20.400
So I think I would,
I would take the,
those hemorrhoids oof the toes.

1449
01:38:20.401 --> 01:38:24.440
Toe.
The little stuff is what gets you in life.
The tone,
the fingers.

1450
01:38:24.441 --> 01:38:29.370
You don't want to hurt those.
Mm hmm.
Oh,
there's one,
they broke it up.

1451
01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:32.430
A one for me and one for you.
All right.
Tom,

1452
01:38:32.431 --> 01:38:37.431
would you rather wear a body suit of Burke Chrysler for one year or have

1453
01:38:37.771 --> 01:38:42.330
Christina where your body suit and make love to your,

1454
01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:46.710
how do I say,
rectum once a month for a year.
Wow.

1455
01:38:47.790 --> 01:38:51.510
Well,
nothing would be worse than having to be like Bart,

1456
01:38:51.690 --> 01:38:56.490
but uh,
that was pat
dammit.

1457
01:38:56.930 --> 01:39:00.020
So I tried to call him back or no,
that's up to you.
All right.

1458
01:39:00.990 --> 01:39:01.823
I'll call them and say,

1459
01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:08.300
I would absolutely make love to my own body suit that you wear over walking

1460
01:39:09.781 --> 01:39:12.630
around with Burt's horrific,

1461
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:16.310
I think can grow better than looking like Burton and Bariatric.

1462
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:20.190
Nice learning or it is a mess.
It's a big fat mess.

1463
01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:24.450
Big Fat mess.
Um,

1464
01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:26.160
Christine's a the one for you.

1465
01:39:26.161 --> 01:39:29.580
Would you rather a little toss Tommy Salad after he farted?
Nope.

1466
01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:34.670
Or shave his butthole after a devastating number six.
Shaved the bundle.
Yeah.

1467
01:39:34.671 --> 01:39:38.460
That's an easy one because of my mouth.
Doesn't have to go on and

1468
01:39:39.970 --> 01:39:44.430
silly fucking shit on my hands daily.
It's like not a problem,
Anthony.

1469
01:39:44.670 --> 01:39:49.630
No.
Tim and Tom,
would you rather jerk off?
Oh God.

1470
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:53.130
Now blank to completion every day while he tells you how much he enjoyed the

1471
01:39:53.131 --> 01:39:58.131
last time you jacked him up or top dog jerk you off every day while he tells you

1472
01:39:58.291 --> 01:40:00.360
how much he enjoyed the last time he jacked to off.

1473
01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:04.860
Interesting at that is a good one.
It is.
And then it says dot,
dot,
dot.

1474
01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:09.510
Or be as fat and sweaty as Bert.
I walked.
Um,

1475
01:40:09.570 --> 01:40:14.570
this one is so horrific that I think I would dive into the most disgusting of

1476
01:40:15.931 --> 01:40:20.850
all choices and be Bert because clearly with dad,
I mean,

1477
01:40:20.851 --> 01:40:24.390
come on,
it's not going to,
I guess the real question is,

1478
01:40:24.391 --> 01:40:27.960
can your dad get a boner or will you get a boner?
It'd be impossible.

1479
01:40:27.980 --> 01:40:30.980
It would be impossible possible for your dad to give you a means.

1480
01:40:30.990 --> 01:40:33.330
These sessions would never end because he was like,
you gotta come,

1481
01:40:33.331 --> 01:40:35.520
you gotta come,
you decided to play this game.

1482
01:40:36.570 --> 01:40:41.340
But then how would you get your dad heart,
man,
he's older too.
Okay.

1483
01:40:41.370 --> 01:40:41.971
Jeans.

1484
01:40:41.971 --> 01:40:45.330
Would you rather it never be able to wipe or clean your asshole for the rest of

1485
01:40:45.331 --> 01:40:49.560
your life?
Oh my God,
it's wine or have gnarly jacked up teeth was shipped.

1486
01:40:49.561 --> 01:40:53.350
Breath while missing your two fronts and never be able to fix anything.
Ah,

1487
01:40:53.370 --> 01:40:54.010
God I ever

1488
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:58.510
<v 2>put in respect on your name,
Jeremy.
Oh No,
hold on.
So you can't wipe your bum bum.</v>

1489
01:40:58.511 --> 01:41:01.570
You can't clean the do off.
Yeah,
let's try to,

1490
01:41:02.110 --> 01:41:05.740
you can't wipe or clean up poop.
Yeah,
I'd rather do that.

1491
01:41:06.130 --> 01:41:08.670
You'd rather be like that.
Who's going to see my asshole?
Yeah,

1492
01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:12.460
but you have a shit fail.
You never wipe ever.
Yeah,
but I was taking a shower.

1493
01:41:12.461 --> 01:41:16.690
He didn't say I can't go in the shower and spread my cheeks and let the water do

1494
01:41:16.691 --> 01:41:19.990
his nation public.
It's seldom happens.

1495
01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:23.890
But if it does sell to just walk around with Dukie.
Yeah,
I've done it before.

1496
01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:26.620
You've never taken a shit that you can't wipe up.

1497
01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:30.130
Hence the never ending wave and why I would shit to shower.

1498
01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:35.290
I've taken shit so disastrous that the wipe wipe,
wipe,
wipe,
wipe does it?

1499
01:41:35.291 --> 01:41:39.160
Sometimes there's just brown in the unaware.
You've never done that.

1500
01:41:39.550 --> 01:41:42.790
The Bud stamp where you leave the Brown in the underwear.

1501
01:41:44.690 --> 01:41:49.430
So disgusting.
Okay.
I got a call pat,
and just to wait.

1502
01:41:49.431 --> 01:41:51.470
I have one for you.
Well,
it's ringing.

1503
01:41:51.471 --> 01:41:55.850
What would you rather have sex with that old lady,
the 91 year old,

1504
01:41:56.120 --> 01:42:00.080
but without your face mask.
Without your,
you got to go all natural.
Yeah.

1505
01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:05.090
No boner pills.
100% natural.
Yeah.
You gotta look in her eyes,

1506
01:42:06.110 --> 01:42:09.470
you gotta be present.
You just have to look in her eyes.
No boner pills.

1507
01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:12.200
No boner pills.
No virtual realities.
Yeah.

1508
01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:16.880
Or you can use lubricant and theater of the mind.

1509
01:42:16.910 --> 01:42:18.380
That's all you got.
Okay.

1510
01:42:19.250 --> 01:42:21.950
Or you take as many steroids.

1511
01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:27.520
So the guy in the opening clip and your ball shrink 50% I'm fucking aunt Edna

1512
01:42:29.241 --> 01:42:34.160
man.
100% rather than have your nut shrink.
But that's a good thing.
Girls like it.

1513
01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:38.740
Yeah.
That's what we learned by the way he like,
he's all for the illusion to,

1514
01:42:38.980 --> 01:42:42.640
it makes your dick look bigger like right.
Make your Dick Bigger.

1515
01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:47.840
It makes it look bigger in relation to your tiny child balls.

1516
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:51.800
Yes.
Yes.
You have a tiny deck and then kid balls.

1517
01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:52.880
<v 15>Yeah,

1520
01:43:00.030 --> 01:43:03.210
<v 2>Slamming her.
Thinking about that guy.
Tiny little balls.</v>

1521
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:10.070
Broken body.

1527
01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:33.790
My God.
I want to kill it when somebody is like,
yeah,

1528
01:43:35.730 --> 01:43:39.120
I'm telling him and he's like,
yeah,
no,
I'm calling you from another number.

1529
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:45.120
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
What does it take for you to answer the fucking phone?

1530
01:43:46.890 --> 01:43:50.640
I'm at work.
I got tables.
All right.
Listen man,
this is really important.
Sorry.

1531
01:43:51.020 --> 01:43:51.853
But um,

1532
01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:56.450
<v 4>there were on the podcast right now and my wife doesn't,</v>

1533
01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:57.740
I told her you were there.

1534
01:43:58.190 --> 01:44:01.880
She wanted to ask about those cigarettes being put out on my hand.
Oops.

1535
01:44:03.290 --> 01:44:05.640
<v 16>Oh yeah,
I'll try the waffle house.
Yeah,
I'm sorry.</v>

1536
01:44:05.790 --> 01:44:08.380
Were outside the waffle house.

1537
01:44:08.530 --> 01:44:12.880
<v 4>Oh,
I didn't get that detail earlier.
Well,
interesting.
No,
because we went late.</v>

1538
01:44:12.881 --> 01:44:15.190
This is,
I told you I've been drinking,
I've been smoking.

1539
01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:19.090
Waffle house is right next to the complex,
the hotel complex.

1540
01:44:19.091 --> 01:44:22.710
So it's like we're walking back.
There's a guy,
he's like,

1541
01:44:22.711 --> 01:44:26.590
I bet you can't jump over the fucking park.
And this guy,
pat described the guy.

1542
01:44:26.591 --> 01:44:27.520
Okay.
Describe the guy.

1543
01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:31.970
<v 16>A white male,
50s junkie.</v>

1544
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:37.210
<v 4>That's funny.
I didn't get that.
What did I leave out and say that earlier?</v>

1545
01:44:37.211 --> 01:44:38.200
He was a junkie or

1546
01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:42.630
<v 16>guy.
It was a road stops ramping it.</v>

1547
01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:47.470
<v 4>And you,
you had a bet going with a road stop.
A transient.</v>

1548
01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:49.450
It was in the moment I was a little drunk.

1549
01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:53.350
I was a little high to be a lot drunk and well I wasn't,
I mean I was,

1550
01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:58.030
I was enough.
I was suggestible.
Yeah,
I was suggestible.
Pat.

1551
01:44:58.031 --> 01:45:00.820
How Fun is my husband when he's drunk or high?

1552
01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:03.720
Just how much fun is he at all?

1553
01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:05.473
<v 16>Fantastic.</v>

1554
01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:09.560
<v 4>See Lie.
I know you're alive.
Can I tell you what she said?</v>

1555
01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:14.570
You're such a liar,
but her,
her general blanket statement was,
Tom,

1556
01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:19.130
you're not a lot of fun.
And that's why I like being married to you.

1557
01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:22.120
Yeah.
You're the best husband.
Never cause you're not a lot of fun.
Yeah.

1558
01:45:22.580 --> 01:45:24.320
<v 16>Well I disagree.
That was the highlight of my weekend.</v>

1559
01:45:24.750 --> 01:45:27.030
<v 4>Si.
Wow.
Si.</v>

1560
01:45:27.660 --> 01:45:31.050
And how did my husband take the pain of the cigarette burns

1561
01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:36.020
owned it.
That's another bullshit.
Why would that be bullshit?

1562
01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:40.330
You don't handle pain well at all like when uh,
exactly.

1563
01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:44.780
Well when ivy you don't handle things like that.
You don't do that.

1564
01:45:44.781 --> 01:45:47.140
Some sadistic weird shit that you don't do.

1565
01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:49.880
You would have to be a totally different person to have this happen to you.

1566
01:45:50.710 --> 01:45:53.470
It was having some kind of midlife crisis.
No,

1567
01:45:53.471 --> 01:45:57.550
but I was just not a hundred mental illness.
I wasn't still shit.

1568
01:45:57.580 --> 01:46:01.600
What do you mean bullshit?
Hey Pat,
what did my husband take that night?

1569
01:46:01.630 --> 01:46:03.670
The led him to do that.

1570
01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:06.283
<v 16>What did he take that?</v>

1571
01:46:06.430 --> 01:46:08.440
<v 4>Yeah.

What did he drink?</v>

1572
01:46:10.350 --> 01:46:12.960
<v 16>We had a couple of beers and Patrona I believe.</v>

1573
01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:18.140
<v 4>Oh,

1577
01:46:22.521 --> 01:46:26.940
how did he know you were toasty?
He did.
Cause he saw me smoke.

1578
01:46:26.941 --> 01:46:30.140
He said when he's toasty he saw me.
He smoked the next night.
Okay.

1579
01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:31.740
A little like a little little toke.

Whatever's dude,
it's a vagary.

1588
01:47:06.490 --> 01:47:08.940
That's funny cause you didn't mention that it was a 50 year old,

1589
01:47:08.941 --> 01:47:11.940
so I knew pat up vagrant.
I mean I,
I didn't leave.

1590
01:47:11.970 --> 01:47:16.950
I didn't give you a different description.
You're just a guy.
Yes it is.

1591
01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:21.600
Just the guys,
the guy,
a victor old vagrant,
like homeless junkie type.

1592
01:47:21.630 --> 01:47:25.690
That's a type you don't,
I mean,
not just gloss over it.
Shit's real.

1593
01:47:26.970 --> 01:47:30.540

1596
01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:38.280
You lie to me.
Every episode,
the Poo piles a lie.

1597
01:47:38.340 --> 01:47:41.130
That's not a light cigarette burns.
Ally Laila,

I can get some phone calls for the poop on it.
This is called projection.

1599
01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:49.920
When you project onto me what you are,
