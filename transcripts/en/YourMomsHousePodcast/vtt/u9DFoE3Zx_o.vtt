<v 0>Uh,

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:23.830
What we got to even get into our circumstance for doing the show today.

6
00:00:23.831 --> 00:00:26.350
We'll get into all that and want a day.
Let's open this show.

7
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.460
It's been a crazy day.
Let's do it.

8
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.980
<v 2>Oh fuck.

9
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.970
So you fucking come over on the side of the dumpster and take a shit.

10
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.300
I throwing this stuff in.

11
00:00:40.301 --> 00:00:45.301
The youngster will pick it up all fuck.

12
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.250
<v 0>Who was ranting?
Don't bring anyone fucking to this.
Yes.</v>

13
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.920
<v 1>Oh,

go to your mom's house.
We've told</v>

14
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.563
Christina.

15
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.433
Oh Wow.

16
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.763
Okay.

17
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:41.763
Yeah.

18
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.650
<v 0>Yeah.
I think that clip just turned my whole day around.
Yeah.</v>

19
00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:51.350
That's nice right now.
Might be my new thing that's ever happened.

20
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.230
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.040
<v 0>Yeah.
That's great.
I don't know why the word diarrhea makes me,</v>

22
00:01:57.041 --> 00:02:01.810
I've always loved it so much.
Yeah,
so much.
You're very shit centered.

23
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.160
Anything duty,
that's your wheelhouse.
It's makes me laugh so much.

24
00:02:06.161 --> 00:02:10.990
You have very distinct wheelhouses that make us laugh.
You know?

25
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.320
That's true.
Because I know if I ever want to make you laugh around the house,

26
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.183
I'll be like,

27
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.870
did you fucking ripper tits off and shit on her face and then Jack often newer

28
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.870
eyes.
Do you stapler tits,
the desk and look at it?
Yeah.
See you got to Chuck Hall.

29
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.130
Yeah,
and then with me it's this duty.
They would eat all day.
Every day.

30
00:02:27.131 --> 00:02:28.120
Makes you always lie.

31
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.360
<v 2>Yeah.
Oh fuck.
Are you doing,</v>

32
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.340
I got diarrhea so you fucking come over on the side of the dumpster and take a

33
00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:41.740
shit rolling this stuff in the dumpster.
I will pick it up all.

34
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.280
Oh my God.
Okay.

35
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.430
<v 0>I've had diarrhea my whole life.
I never think to go like that,</v>

36
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.410
but that's a real emergency.
I guess.
I've had real emergencies.
I feel like.

37
00:02:55.411 --> 00:02:57.870
I feel like you can almost always find somewhere to go.

38
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.450
That's not a parking lot.

39
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.540
Story about a guy I once met at a party and he goes,

40
00:03:05.541 --> 00:03:08.030
one time I was in Thailand and I was

41
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.960
in a taxi cab flanked by these two girls.

42
00:03:11.961 --> 00:03:14.600
I was trying and he goes,

43
00:03:14.601 --> 00:03:19.601
I had a bout of diarrhea hit me so hard and we were like in like just traffic,

44
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.710
light,
red light.
Nothing's going to happen.
He goes,
man,
I was holding it in,

45
00:03:24.711 --> 00:03:28.490
holding it in and just sweating and going through waves and he's like,

46
00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:31.510
eventually I just willed it away.
Yeah,
that's,
that's what I've done.

47
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.340
I've wilted away many times.
It's really rough.
Well,
you know what?
Your body,

48
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.250
your body will fight if you're trying to get laid.

49
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.980
You're as a man.
If you have diarrhea and you're like,
there's a woman there.

50
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:48.640
I'm trying to have your body,
we will stop this diarrhea

51
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.850
inside of the toxic sickness.
Yes,

52
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.100
so that you can get laid good priorities.

53
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.420
That's how the male body and brain work.
I've got diarrhea.

54
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.520
He announced it,
but you're so vulnerable,
so vulnerable.

55
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.590
You kind of have to announce it like

56
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.530
his shit covered paper.
I'm throwing this stuff in the dumpster.

57
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.370
Is that Brody Stevens?
That's how he says it.
That's

58
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.160
the street that guy

59
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.890
would you call them out though?
I mean I feel like I'd have empathy and be like,

60
00:04:36.891 --> 00:04:41.720
it's all I do.
Just clean up.
Just don't leave your toilet paper out here.
Okay.
No,

61
00:04:41.721 --> 00:04:44.780
I mean there's a couple of things that he might know that guy as a guy that's

62
00:04:44.781 --> 00:04:46.730
kind of lingers and is always,
you know what I mean?

63
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.920
And the guy who was always like,
hey man,
get the fuck.

64
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.620
The guy's always making customers feel uncomfortable.
Like he knows that guy.

65
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.700
So it's like,
it's almost familiar.
Like,
hey man,
the fuck are you doing?

66
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.320
Do you know what that sound is?

67
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.100
The sound of 500 emails pouring and telling us that they've done public.
Oh yeah,

68
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:09.280
yeah.
I know it's going to really heard the pings,
right?
Yeah.
No,

69
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.230
it's lit up.
But all the diarrhea story going to be,

70
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.940
<v 3>I've done it.</v>

71
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.870
I've shown on the side of the road

72
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.220
<v 0>I have had,
I remember badly,
I almost did.
I remember in college,</v>

73
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.250
Sophomore Year of college being in a girl's dorm room who was down to do it and

74
00:05:37.201 --> 00:05:42.120
she was like,
like just like get comfortable.
And I felt the diarrhea,

75
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.180
like strong.
Now this is true,
I remember this or Nay,
I met her name,

76
00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:51.590
I remember her name was Mary Lynn.
So,
uh,

77
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.790
yeah,
yeah,
it's Marilyn Roscoe was married so,

78
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.760
but his name was Maryann was Marilyn and she,
uh,
so anyways,

79
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:05.840
I was like,
I got a test in the morning,
I got to get back.

80
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.010
And I think she was like,
wow,
you're turning down.

81
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:11.990
So anyways,
but I was like,

82
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.050
I still gave her like a kiss and I go back to my room and it's a like a black

83
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:19.220
pool,
like a,

84
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.420
it's like a rotten just pool explosion.

85
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.470
And if so much so my suite mates,

86
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:30.950
like not my roommate but the suite mates were like,
what the fuck's going on?

87
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.840
And then cause I could hear the explosions and like I hear it everyday was one

88
00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:38.920
of the most horrendous shits I've ever taken.

89
00:06:38.921 --> 00:06:43.460
Like I remember the shits so well and then I clean up and I'm like,

90
00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:46.160
I can't go back there now.
You know,
like I said,
like,

91
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.370
cause I basically what I wanted to do was shit at her place and then try to get

92
00:06:51.591 --> 00:06:53.900
laid.
But I knew I could feel what it was.

93
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.570
I know I could feel what it was like if it would have been one thing,

94
00:06:56.571 --> 00:06:58.760
if I'm like,
I kinda got to shit.
Maybe it had been,

95
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.420
but you can never get away with shooting at a girl's house and her not knowing.

96
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.450
Yeah.
And then we're going to do it.
It's just like,
so,

97
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:11.060
and it would be first time doing it so shitty.
So,
uh,

98
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.280
the next day her friend was like,
oh my gosh,

99
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:21.230
you have such a cool guy.
And I go,
what?
She's like,
you know,

100
00:07:21.231 --> 00:07:26.210
like most guys would have just like jumped at the opportunity or whatever,

101
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:29.840
but you're like,
whatever.
I have to like,

102
00:07:29.841 --> 00:07:34.670
she thought I was being respectful of her and not like not wanting to rush

103
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:35.504
things.

104
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.720
We talk ourselves.
And I was like,

105
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.080
I just had to shit so bad that there was no way I could do it.

106
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:50.840
So,
uh,
but I was like,
yeah,
no,
I know.
I am a nice guy.

107
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:57.170
I just respect yourself.
Respect.
So,
so much.
Such a good girl.

108
00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:01.780
Yeah,
she's just really cool.
Yeah,
that's really funny.
You know,

109
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:02.421
on time man,

110
00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:07.421
I was working as a PA and this guy was hosting some TV show and I was a PA and I

111
00:08:08.751 --> 00:08:11.960
remember I had to shuttle him around that day and we were in the Beverly,

112
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.910
some Beverly Hills Mall.
Right.

113
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:19.900
And I remember that dude had to shit really badly and I'll tell you it is off

114
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:20.600
off my,

115
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.680
but we're going down this escalator and I just saw it on his face like he really

116
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:29.510
had to shit,
he's a celebrity.
And I was like,
dude,
you have to shit.

117
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.000
Like I just called them and I was like,
do you have to go shit or something?

118
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:36.680
And he's like,
yeah,
like he didn't want to admit that I was right.

119
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.230
And then I was like,
toilets right there,
dude.
Just go shit.

120
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.380
Like I think he was trying to play it cool around me because your girl and

121
00:08:42.381 --> 00:08:45.620
you're attractive.
That's why nobody,
it doesn't matter.

122
00:08:45.621 --> 00:08:49.790
Like he could be whatever.
Uh,
like on his honeymoon.

123
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.440
And you still don't want to be like to a girl,
like I gotta ship bad,
not you.

124
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:55.890
You're the exception.

125
00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:00.300
Doug Mellard in his fiance came over a gorgeous blonde hair,

126
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.770
Brown eyes.
Pretty sweet girl.
You sat at the dinner table,

127
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.940
you lived your ass cheeks,
you farted,
and then you went,
I gotta take a shit.

128
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.950
And then I went and Shit.
And then you shit.

129
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.580
And not even by another bathroom away from us,

130
00:09:14.581 --> 00:09:17.310
like the kitchen bathroom that everyone uses.

131
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:21.060
And we can hear you through the door.
Like you didn't even try to,

132
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.590
that's different.
Go down the hall.
It's different.
How's that different?

133
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.810
<v 4>First of all,
they're like family.
I mean like Doug and,
and,</v>

134
00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:33.250
and Flynn have have been on the road.

135
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:37.340
That's a different level because I'm comfortable.
I'm saying like a stranger.

136
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:42.560
Like if it's like you met someone and you're like,
Hey,
I just met you.

137
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.920
Oh yeah.
It's hard.
It's harder to be like,
I got to shit,
you know?

138
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:51.870
<v 0>Yeah.
I've never shit.
Um,
and,</v>

139
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.690
and not a toilet,
you know what I'm saying?
Like,

140
00:09:54.691 --> 00:09:58.230
unless I'd been an Asia and like I've had to squat on the ground,

141
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.700
I kept licking Kyrgyzstan.
I had to do that.
But you know,

142
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.490
I've always held it now p I peed everywhere.

143
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.940
I feel like I peed all over the earth that peed on the side of the freeway.

144
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:13.710
Some wild places.
Yeah.
I mean I pissed on public transportation.

145
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:20.020
Haven't we all at some point drives backstage that shows where the bathroom was

146
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.340
accessible was with you at time.
Yeah.

147
00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.620
And I've done that multiple times.
A Piston,
that trashcan back stage one time.

148
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.360
A little know that thing of like,
you're like,

149
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.370
you're up and by the way,

150
00:10:35.371 --> 00:10:37.800
you're going to be up there 60 70 minutes and you're like,

151
00:10:37.801 --> 00:10:40.200
I gotta Piss real quick.
And they were like,
oh,
there's no bathroom around here.

152
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.830
And you're like,
well,
I've got to go.
And they're like,
well,
you know,

153
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:47.100
just hold it for an hour and change.
No,
I'm not doing that.

154
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.680
Or there's nowhere for you to shit before your show.

155
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:52.260
So you gotta go to shit where the audience shifts and everyone's like,
hey,

156
00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:53.094
aren't you the,

157
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:58.610
aren't you the girl that's Kinda taking a shit with your audience is terrible

158
00:10:58.681 --> 00:11:02.940
man.
It's terrible.
It's not fair.
It's certainly not fair.

159
00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.370
We should establish this [inaudible] we're jumping all over.

160
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:10.270
<v 4>Um,
so today we had an emergency.</v>

161
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:11.400
Yeah.

162
00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:17.010
Are reliable and wonderful nanny who comes on this day always at a certain time.

163
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:24.930
And we do the show usually in a certain window called in and had like some

164
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:26.943
family stuff.

165
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:31.040
<v 0>She has a family emergency and we're like,
oh,
that's the worst day to Collin.</v>

166
00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:34.310
Like that.
This is our podcast and we have a tight schedule.
I'm in town,

167
00:11:34.311 --> 00:11:39.050
I'm in La 48 hours.
I know.
So I was like a bad week for this.
So actually,

168
00:11:39.051 --> 00:11:42.470
and we also had scheduled Martin,
Risa,
the water someone.
Yeah.

169
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.430
So it was all like set up,
love

170
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:48.510
<v 4>to go and then everything got thrown away.
So anyways,</v>

171
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.620
I ended up doing,

172
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.220
I ended up doing the water session segment

173
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.640
<v 0>with Martin.
Right.
Which is that tagged onto the end of this app.</v>

174
00:11:57.641 --> 00:12:00.510
So it will be Christina and I and then garden.
I was watching the baby gene.

175
00:12:00.511 --> 00:12:00.760
Right.

176
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.910
And of course let him down for his nap and now we have maybe 45 minutes to get

177
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.550
there.
We just don't know.
We don't know how much,

178
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.090
I mean the baby could freak out and we have the monitor here.

179
00:12:10.091 --> 00:12:12.640
It's just the way it goes.
This is one of those old school podcast.

180
00:12:12.641 --> 00:12:14.560
Whenever we used to do this,
when he was first a baby,

181
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:19.480
he'd be in the next room and we do the show during stop when we hear cries,

182
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:24.940
hopefully just crashes hard here.

183
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:29.873
And then you know,

184
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.370
he's all fucked up cause that one hour do it really messes up babies.

185
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:38.580
Well yeah it does our front gate malfunction.

186
00:12:38.921 --> 00:12:42.040
And then what else went wrong?

187
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.740
It was just,
today's not a good day.
No,

188
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.180
but it just got better with that diarrhea clip

189
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:56.920
really opened up my happiness man.

190
00:12:56.921 --> 00:12:59.490
And you know what else I've been thinking about my friend Shannon,
I came,

191
00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.300
that's the joy comes back into my life.
Well,

192
00:13:04.301 --> 00:13:07.180
my friend Shawna came to visit me my BFF and uh,

193
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.820
and she listens to the show with her husband,
Jimmy.
And she goes,
we were,

194
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:15.430
we were talking upstairs.
She goes,
man,
that guy who takes 10 to 12 Ben and drill,

195
00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:19.150
she goes,
I take one and I'm like anxious and sweating.

196
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.050
It's like who can take them any Benadryl?

197
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:28.150
She takes them regularly for her allergies and she said that is way too much.

198
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:33.210
That's a lot.
I mean,
what about this guy though?
Love to fuck.

199
00:13:33.211 --> 00:13:34.044
Fuck,
fuck,

200
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:41.980
fuck me at 2195 move it.
But you got to fuck the,

201
00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.220
I need to be fought a lot.
We got it.
We got it.

202
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:49.940
What do you think's the point of that?
He really needs it.
You gave out.

203
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:54.240
He gave out that address.
Don't you think a Craig's list ad would suffice?

204
00:13:54.241 --> 00:13:57.160
Like he needs to put a youtube video out.
I think he really wants,

205
00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.280
I think he's trying to step it up.
Very indiscriminate.

206
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:06.400
Written that it's like,
yeah,

207
00:14:06.401 --> 00:14:11.200
it's bad.
I got some nice pillows.
Do you want to fuck or what?

208
00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.800
You can move in here.
Your friends can move in here or you got to jail.

209
00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:19.210
Are you a homeless bum?
Do you want to Piss on me?
Beat me up.
I mean you really,

210
00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:23.410
somebody by the way can definitely satisfy all of his name.

211
00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.860
There's a person right now,
it was like,
check,
check,
check.
Oh man,
dude,
man,

212
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.440
I'm out of jail,
homeless.
I'll piss on you.

213
00:14:29.441 --> 00:14:33.760
I'll beat the shit out of you and it's free rent and my friends can come away

214
00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:35.260
and which gives it up to his friends.

215
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.100
It's all winter when really one of the more substantial guys,

216
00:14:39.101 --> 00:14:41.980
it's we've ever played on the show that is quite a singles ad.

217
00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:46.240
You don't really get to see those.
And again,
I think I said it last week,

218
00:14:46.241 --> 00:14:49.780
but I think everybody understands the sentiment,

219
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.670
the impulses of,
of,
of saying that.

220
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:55.910
But there's a big party when you feel like when you feel like,

221
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.710
I want to get fucked.
That goes,

222
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.390
maybe I shouldn't make this video and put it online though.
What?

223
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.360
What do you imagine the response was to that?

224
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.550
Especially now that we've broadcast at someone listening some,

225
00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:12.340
some derelict listener of this show was like,
yeah,
well that was great.

226
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:16.610
The crazy thing is that,
yeah.
Yeah.
I know somebody is somebody,

227
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.480
wherever this is originally posted has his full home address.

228
00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:24.010
Like we edit it out for his sake.
Right,
right.

229
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:28.500
But his full home address is like whatever,
one,
two,
three main street.
Yeah.

230
00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.870
He's like,
that's where I live.

231
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.730
If you want to come over here and piss on me for free rent and bring her out of

232
00:15:34.731 --> 00:15:38.630
jail friends too.
That's really what's wrong with people.
You know?

233
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:42.770
I think it's crazy to even show what neighborhood you live in on Instagram.
Yeah,

234
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.760
let alone,
you know,
given that your addy,
it's really wild.

235
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:52.520
You want to Piss and shit.
His cadence is so it's that weird guy cadence to,

236
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.750
yeah,
it's like a that psychotic east coast.
Fuck me.

237
00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:00.530
Yeah.
Like piss on me.
Yeah.
You want to Piss on me?

238
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.830
Try that or I want to be fucked.
There's no break in the words.

239
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.510
Did they run together?

240
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:10.280
I know that that's a real sign of his psycho it when there's no pauses.
Yeah,

241
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:14.120
yeah.
No,
he's really good contact.
No,
blanking by the way.
So,
you know,

242
00:16:14.121 --> 00:16:18.770
I think I've,
I've told stories on this shit podcast about how as I tour,

243
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.690
you know,
especially for the first,
like nine months of this tour,

244
00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.940
every time I'd go to stage,
you know,

245
00:16:25.941 --> 00:16:30.941
I'm walking onto the stage in some pretty big rooms as the applause dies.

246
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:32.840
There's kind of like that moment,
right?

247
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:36.710
So you grabbed the mic there clapping and you go,
thank you.
Thanks a lot.

248
00:16:36.711 --> 00:16:40.710
And it's like as you're about to start doing standup,
right.
Does that moment,

249
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:45.740
a lot of times it was,
hey Hitler right now,
it'd be like Jesus Christ.

250
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.840
Yeah.
Now,
yeah.

251
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:52.370
Machines within people are screaming machines within.
Oh,

252
00:16:52.371 --> 00:16:57.050
I like that.
Yeah.
Well it's a hit song and we turned it into a smash hit.
Yeah.

253
00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:01.820
We are responsible and our audience is responsible.
Yeah.

254
00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:05.300
Force creating such a great song.
Amazing move.

255
00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:09.650
Visions came in amazing so much.
I've got this email that I'm dying to read.
Okay.

256
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:13.340
I came into that's deep bro,
which I think is really funny.

257
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:19.560
Uh,
but anyway,
yeah,
continue talking as,
yeah.
Okay.

258
00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:23.220
Well I have another machines within.
Oh my God.
Great thought.
I would,
uh,

259
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.120
share it with you.
It looks like there's a video component to this one as well.

260
00:17:26.121 --> 00:17:30.250
Here we go.
Frog.

261
00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.113

There you go.
That's good.

264
00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:54.090
It's really good.
I actually,

265
00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.130
the video is great.
That's really good.
Yeah.

266
00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.700
My rap is your thing on.
No,

267
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:22.000
that's really good.
I'm impressed.
Yeah.

268
00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:28.330
Rashid's with it.
That's great.
It's so good.

269
00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:37.210
I mean,
come on deep.
Yeah.
Like they made it a soulful,
yeah.

270
00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:41.660
This is a soulful thing,
Elliot.

271
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.740
It says by Elliot.
Yeah.

272
00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:50.550
I'm impressed about him.

273
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:57.080
<v 4>I'm impressed.
I really liked it.
Yeah.
Do you have any other ones?
Um,</v>

274
00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:02.240
well that's all I see in here for machines within submissions,

275
00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:06.310
but we have some new,
uh,
she's retarded songs.
Good.

276
00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.870
So this is,
she's retarded.
It's called,

277
00:19:10.871 --> 00:19:12.760
it's developmentally disabled by day.

278
00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.270
<v 6>You'll keep</v>

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:35.350
<v 4>I'm retarded.</v>

281
00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:39.140
<v 8>Yeah.

297
00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:58.310
I like the different styles.
David Brubeck

298
00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.050
you don't normally hear like jazz,
like,

299
00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.320
oh wow.

300
00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:44.210
<v 0>All right.
I like that.
I guess who I met on Saturday who?
Gaping Dad.</v>

301
00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.990
You're kidding.
He came to my show in Austin,

302
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:52.460
your mom's house celebrity.
Oh,
that's for sure.
And he's made an incredible,

303
00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:55.820
incredible songs.
And uh,
you know,
I told him,
I go,

304
00:21:55.821 --> 00:22:00.290
I want to thank you for all the songs you've made.
You're definitely on our top,

305
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:05.270
you know,
top tier,
uh,
music,
the songs that he submitted a been incredible.

306
00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:08.760
And he goes,
oh,
thanks.
And then he goes,
uh,
uh,
I'm working on a,

307
00:22:08.761 --> 00:22:12.770
she's retarded one and I cannot wait to get off.
So I don't have that yet,

308
00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.440
but I'm a genius.
No,

309
00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.320
but I believe in Nate from Indy who submitted a great,

310
00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:25.250
I think he submitted a machines within song also submitted a,

311
00:22:25.251 --> 00:22:27.920
she's retarded stuff.
Um,
and he,

312
00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:32.600
he's an actual guitar player and singer,
so I Remember,

313
00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:34.440
<v 9>Oh yes,
she is rich.</v>

314
00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:40.010
[inaudible]

315
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:51.930
<v 0>there you go.
Well,</v>

316
00:22:51.931 --> 00:22:56.430
I feel like that one really got the message across of like the distinction

317
00:22:56.431 --> 00:22:59.730
between being retarded or mentally disabled and it's such an important

318
00:22:59.731 --> 00:23:02.250
distinction.
Some people are just retarded,
you know?

319
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:09.360
That's what that guy was trying to say.
Right.
Her Shit,
she's retarded man.

320
00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:13.740
And he wasn't trying to say she has downs.
She's mentally to say it was like,
no,

321
00:23:13.741 --> 00:23:17.840
she does retarded shit.
Retarded.
Yeah.
Like that.

322
00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.600
Do you really think that's the hidden meaning of she's retarded.
Oh,

323
00:23:21.601 --> 00:23:26.590
hundred percent is that she act out all the time.
Yeah.
Sally.

324
00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.540
Sally's just retarded.
Retarded.
So silly.

325
00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:36.360
Yeah,
I think so man.
These songs,
I tell you every now and then we hit a wave,

326
00:23:36.361 --> 00:23:40.440
a real talent submissions on this shell and this is one of those times,

327
00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.220
yeah.
When the songs come in,
it's like,

328
00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.960
it's really one my favorite things that happens really.
It really,

329
00:23:47.961 --> 00:23:52.400
really makes me happy.
Of course.
Read the email.

330
00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:55.760
Ha,
this is funny.
So it says,
Hi Christina.

331
00:23:55.761 --> 00:23:58.010
I was listening to your mom's house episodes.

332
00:23:58.011 --> 00:23:59.930
We were discussing showering with Tom.

333
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:03.100
I don't know if you guys remember that episode,
but uh,

334
00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:04.720
it started when we lived at the,

335
00:24:04.721 --> 00:24:09.320
up this other house a year ago and Tom and I showered together on occasion.

336
00:24:09.321 --> 00:24:12.980
Not so much anymore,
uh,
just for logistic reasons kid.

337
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:18.850
But you came in and you peed on me and it smelled like you had dumped an entire

338
00:24:20.001 --> 00:24:23.960
crap of coffee into the shower because you don't hydrate a lot.

339
00:24:23.961 --> 00:24:26.500
And that's what started this whole water champ.
Did Look,

340
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:29.180
look what you're drinking now is that,
that doesn't look like water to me.

341
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:33.200
It looks like coffee.
So,
uh,
it was disgusting.

342
00:24:33.201 --> 00:24:38.030
And then you blew snot rockets and then they,
that's not got stuck in your beard.

343
00:24:38.031 --> 00:24:39.890
And then you just,
you look a Hobo.

344
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:44.600
It's like showering with a guy who had diarrhea.
Yeah.
You're like,

345
00:24:44.601 --> 00:24:49.440
the guy had taken diarrhea is on the,
on the,
uh,
the dunks,
diarrhea.
She,

346
00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:53.660
so she writes,
and I'm 21 years old and I've never showered with the guy.

347
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:57.260
The thought of being in a shower with a guy as he's washing his butt hole just

348
00:24:57.261 --> 00:24:58.250
never appealed to me.

349
00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:02.250
I have worked in the nursing aide field for a couple of years and I'm currently

350
00:25:02.251 --> 00:25:03.170
in nursing school.

351
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:07.130
Maybe all the years of bathing pervy old men turned me off to the idea.

352
00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:10.580
The last time I stayed at my booze place.
He mentioned that we shower together.

353
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.370
I told him I didn't want to and he thought that was weird.

354
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.190
What should I expect from my first time showering with a guy?

355
00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:19.460
How do I make washing my armpits sexy?

356
00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:23.330
Are blowjobs requirement or is it supposed to be cute or both?

357
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:28.340
It's a really good question.
It sounds like a sweet lady.
Young.

358
00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:33.410
I think first of all,
if,
uh,
if it's her be,
um,
well first of all,

359
00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.420
you know your BFF.
You know what I mean?

360
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:38.360
Like if he's thank you know your BFF and then you shower with them.

361
00:25:38.361 --> 00:25:42.640
And figure out he's a Hobo Blow Scott rockets at that point.

362
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:47.030
What I'm saying is that,
I dunno what stage of BF this is,
but obviously it's,

363
00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:49.910
it's a stage where they spend the night at each other's house.

364
00:25:49.911 --> 00:25:53.180
She's been with him for a while so it's not like it's a new new thing.

365
00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:58.660
I think more than likely if he's asking you to shower for the first time and it

366
00:25:58.701 --> 00:26:02.120
hasn't been done,
he doesn't want to screw that up for the next year.
First Time.

367
00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:04.100
Yeah.
So I think that that stuff later,

368
00:26:04.101 --> 00:26:05.780
first time you have nothing to worry about.

369
00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:09.650
Like he's going to be on probably good behavior.
He's going to soap your back,

370
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:14.430
he's going to do like hell let you have the hot water and then that switches

371
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:16.790
very quickly.
Cause when that's why we don't shower together,

372
00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:20.480
it's I'll be in the hot water and enjoying myself and then you will physically

373
00:26:20.481 --> 00:26:25.130
grab me and pull me out of the car and then take it yourself.
Rephrase that.

374
00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:29.690
I would rephrase that.
I would say that I would like some,
some hot water,

375
00:26:29.691 --> 00:26:33.920
not scorching hot water.
So I have to move you and turn the hot water down,

376
00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:38.090
which is actually saving hot water for you.
Cause I take human shop,

377
00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:43.130
pull me out of the stream and then I suffer.
I'm sure I need it for a moment,

378
00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:47.070
but look,
I think he probably be a nice thing and you don't have to like,
yeah,

379
00:26:47.071 --> 00:26:48.600
you soap wherever you want.

380
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:53.310
He's going to probably wash his asshole in front of no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Hell,
hell.

381
00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:55.740
Put that off.
Yeah,
no,
he'll wash his dick and balls.

382
00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:59.230
He'll wash that and he'll probably like try to get a couple of grabs.
You know,

383
00:26:59.231 --> 00:27:02.820
I'd probably probably stuck his finger in your crack.
Um,

384
00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:04.190
he'll soap up your back seat.

385
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:10.160
That's where you're wrong because not all men are as derelict as you are where

386
00:27:10.621 --> 00:27:11.320
you do that,

387
00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:15.980
where you might butt cheeks with your fingers and your golf plants.

388
00:27:15.981 --> 00:27:20.460
What I worry about that weird,
right?
Not all guys do that kind of stop.

389
00:27:20.461 --> 00:27:25.320
You think it's playful that,
but I'll tell you that.
But you're definitely,

390
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:29.200
you know,
rare.
I'd never had a boyfriend that would do all that mean stuff to me.

391
00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:33.500
Well,
it mean spreading my butt cheeks.
Memory used to take care of you.

392
00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:36.780
You go like that and like,
why are you spreading him peeing on me?

393
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.380
I didn't have a boyfriend that did that until you said that the spreading was

394
00:27:40.381 --> 00:27:44.190
menacing.
Menacing.
Yeah.
I didn't like it.
I didn't like it.

395
00:27:44.191 --> 00:27:47.910
I just tolerated it because I love you.
I didn't do the red flag.

396
00:27:47.911 --> 00:27:52.770
I should have paid attention to probably ah,
so many what?

397
00:27:52.771 --> 00:27:57.480
Your love of a sociopath's and murderings and stuff like that.

398
00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:01.560
That was a big red flag.
You didn't use soap in your shower,
stuff like that.

399
00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:08.220
You're washing your,
washing your crotch with shampoo.
That's what people do.

400
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:13.140
Not all people.
Everything that I did to you is normal.
Yeah,
sure it is.
Now.

401
00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:18.460
Um,
this gave me a laugh.
I thought you might like this,
this lady,

402
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:20.930
she's retarded.
Retarded going through her

403
00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:27.650
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

404
00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:33.780
<v 0>yeah,
having a good time,
right.</v>

405
00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:40.020
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

406
00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.730
oh my God.

407
00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:55.480
<v 0>Uh,
they just fucked up the interior of the car.</v>

408
00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:59.240
She had moose suit vibes.
Definitely same.
Yeah.

409
00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:02.110
So basically it feels weak or who aren't watching on Youtube,

410
00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:06.220
the sun roof leaked and this woman is in a drive through car wash and all the

411
00:29:06.221 --> 00:29:09.090
water just got in her interior,
fucked up her car.

412
00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:12.290
It looks like the will probably happen is the,

413
00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.480
the interior slide door is closed and the,

414
00:29:16.481 --> 00:29:20.170
I bet you the top window is that,
that elevated clashes.

415
00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.910
You know how they have to have that feature though,

416
00:29:21.911 --> 00:29:23.630
where you can be like cracked?

417
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:29.140
Like it's not open backwards like lifted up so you can have like a breeze of
air.

418
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.080
Oh my God.
And I think she,
uh,
she didn't realize that.

419
00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:38.020
That's terrible.
Yeah.
That's pretty bad that your car is over.
Oh Man.

420
00:29:38.021 --> 00:29:42.670
That'd be so I'd be just as pissed as she is.
She was so terrible.
That's really,

421
00:29:42.671 --> 00:29:45.810
really,
your car's totally ruined.
Yeah.
And they've got leather right

422
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:47.283
<v 9>town,</v>

423
00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:53.173
<v 0>Huh?</v>

424
00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:58.020
<v 4>It was poor.
It wasn't trickling in.
Especially on the passenger side.</v>

425
00:29:58.021 --> 00:29:58.854
Look how much water is.

426
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.770
<v 9>It's trickling in there.
But look to the right here.</v>

427
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.860
There are law.
Dammit.
Uh,

428
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:13.290
that is a bummer.
You're right.
I think it's all cracked up.

429
00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:17.730
<v 0>Yeah,
I think it's propped up.
Yeah.
Now whose fault would that be?
I don't know.</v>

430
00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:22.730
I think it would be the driver's fault.
Yeah,
that's true.
Sure.
Car Damn Dad.

431
00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:27.900
She's super pissed,
man.
Car Washes are fun when you're sitting in the car.
Yeah.

432
00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:32.190
It still is a thrill.
Of course.
Yeah.
I don't like it when they take my car.

433
00:30:32.191 --> 00:30:36.310
I like to sit in it.
Yeah,
it's a dirty,
yeah.

434
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:42.020
This is very similar.
It could be her.
Yeah.
How's the dirty bit Ph,

435
00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:47.010
right.
It has kind of that vibe.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So maybe her cousin here,

436
00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:51.600
dammit.
Oh my gosh.
Right.
You hear the little mix up there?

437
00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.930
No sign of a

438
00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:04.110
very close.
Oh Shit.
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

439
00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:08.160
That was very close.
It was awesome Jean.
Oh,
that's pretty good.

440
00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:13.010
You guys are doing good.
You're doing good,
man.
Here you go.

441
00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.033
Close.

442
00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:27.620
So this is interesting.
Your arm was wiping solved.
Oh,
okay.

443
00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:30.350
<v 4>I was listening to episode four 20 I had an epiphany.</v>

444
00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:33.950
I worked at a movie theater for years.
Once while I was working,

445
00:31:33.951 --> 00:31:38.060
a coworker walked into the handicap washroom and found shit covered.

446
00:31:38.061 --> 00:31:42.110
Toilet paper wrapped around the grab bar next to the toilet.

447
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:45.410
I have spent years pondering how this happened.

448
00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:50.710
It is now obvious to me that an arm was person had an emergency brown wrap the

449
00:31:50.781 --> 00:31:55.250
toilet paper around the bar with their highly skilled feet and then rubbed up on

450
00:31:55.251 --> 00:31:57.290
it.
Obviously after they were done,

451
00:31:57.291 --> 00:32:00.860
they had no way of getting it off without getting their feet covered in shit.

452
00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:06.060
Mystery solved.
Hope.
This was of some help machines within epic.

453
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:10.640
<v 0>The hair.
It is.
Wow.
The machines with ingredients,
it's a whole new thing.</v>

454
00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:14.390
The whole thing now why?
Well,
what's an interesting theory?
I,

455
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.960
I don't see why not.
Yeah,
it's possible.
It's definitely possible.

456
00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:24.580
<v 4>Zinzer uh,
in gender specific way.
Hi Hitler's dammit.</v>

457
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.280
When trying to be sensitive to people's pronouns,

458
00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.960
what do those who speak big words with gender types in their speech?

459
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:33.480
Do Spanish,
French,
Italian,

460
00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:37.540
have non Zinzer types in their words built in and we'll never be able to respect

461
00:32:37.541 --> 00:32:40.450
the pronoun because so many words being masculine,

462
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.670
<v 0>feminine.
That is fucking brilliant.
And that is so true.</v>

463
00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:49.060
Are these languages doomed to be cis scum speech for all eternity and should we

464
00:32:50.361 --> 00:32:52.760
be eliminating them to make sure everyone is safe?

465
00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:57.740
Please respond with your wisdom running the industry.
Wow Allen,

466
00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:02.240
that is so good.
Run an industry.
That is so good.

467
00:33:02.241 --> 00:33:06.500
That's a really good point.
Because the respectful languages,
the Germans,

468
00:33:06.501 --> 00:33:09.800
they have nuder form right there.
Right here.

469
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:14.390
There are some languages that don't have a neutral and new gender neuter and he

470
00:33:14.391 --> 00:33:18.920
is such a good question.
As a someone who speaks,
you know,
decent Spanish,

471
00:33:18.921 --> 00:33:22.610
I can tell you that you're always constantly trying to remember.

472
00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.620
<v 4>You know,
somebody like I've said I,
you know,</v>

473
00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:31.010
my Spanish has definitely gone down hill because I don't use it as much as I

474
00:33:31.291 --> 00:33:33.810
used to.
But that is a thing where it's like is it,

475
00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:37.730
<v 0>is it masculine or feminine?
Is the word el or La Mesa.</v>

476
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.480
El Mesa,
right?
Is it la?
Uh,
La Mesa.

477
00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:47.060
Cause it ends an island.
So you're attributing a feminine,
you know,

478
00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.450
Gosh,
title to the word,
right,
of course it.

479
00:33:50.451 --> 00:33:54.410
Then how are the non binary people going to tolerate this?

480
00:33:54.411 --> 00:33:57.650
And these lands because you have to say something to somebody in countries,

481
00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:01.540
<v 4>uh,
Decosta and they'd be like,</v>

482
00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.440
wait.
I'm like,
oh,

483
00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.120
but we want to put on their boots though.

484
00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:18.650
<v 0>So what would they say?
I have no idea actually.
That's,
that's why I'm fasting</v>

485
00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:20.730
<v 4>dated by this.
How do,</v>

486
00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:26.060
how does does this whole movement of gender pronouns effect people that don't

487
00:34:28.561 --> 00:34:29.690
speak English?
Because we are,

488
00:34:29.691 --> 00:34:31.650
have been just been tied into the English speaking world.

489
00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:35.810
<v 0>Right.
And we've,
we've seen the documentary,
that vice documentary,
that was it.</v>

490
00:34:35.811 --> 00:34:38.180
Sweden,
I think it was,

491
00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:42.260
which is the neutral right now.
He was like,

492
00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:44.510
or they were like,

493
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:49.930
do you want to be like a woman or a gender neutral day?

494
00:34:50.031 --> 00:34:54.890
And then the kid was like,
I just want to go by my name mark.
Yeah,
I know.

495
00:34:54.891 --> 00:34:59.180
It's so funny because Ellis is about the age of the kid that they're asking on a

496
00:34:59.181 --> 00:35:03.440
daily basis what they feel like.
I'm like looking at my kid,

497
00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:05.240
he doesn't even understand the question.

498
00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:09.290
There's no debate in his mind like about what gender,

499
00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:13.820
it's just not on the table yet.
It's a look.
It's confined.

500
00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:18.410
I think you're confusing him.
I'm sorry them a little bit.
They get confused.

501
00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:21.080
But I'm interested in the Latin speaking.

502
00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:25.250
If anyone out there has any insight into whether Spanish,
French,

503
00:35:25.251 --> 00:35:28.490
Italian speakers,
how they approach somebody who's like,

504
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:33.440
I'm not either gender,
how do words then get used?

505
00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.000
Because words are very,
yeah,
too

506
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.860
<v 4>much.
They have a um,</v>

507
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:42.510
<v 0>a gender like tie in to them in those languages.
Yes.
It was very,</v>

508
00:35:42.511 --> 00:35:45.990
there's few ways I think you can say something.
Gender neutral.
That's true.

509
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:49.860
That's absolutely true.
Well,
in German you have d dare and dos.

510
00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.790
Those are the three different,
uh,
feminine,
masculine and Neuter.

511
00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:58.980
And you have to fucking memorize every word with DDR or dos.
That's terrible.

512
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.860
Yeah.
It's so hard.
Interesting.
Where do non binaries go to prison?
Well,

513
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:07.380
that's cool.
Well,
in California,
didn't we just have the,
uh,

514
00:36:07.381 --> 00:36:10.200
the thing that transgender people can choose what this person asked,
they say,

515
00:36:10.201 --> 00:36:12.930
I heard of the California allowed to put a third gender on your license,

516
00:36:12.931 --> 00:36:14.730
separate from male or female.

517
00:36:14.731 --> 00:36:17.850
So I was thinking if you one of those people and you have to go to prison,

518
00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:21.620
do you go to mail prisoner?
A female prison?
Thanks.
Fish Abuser.
Well,

519
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:24.420
I mean if they're non or non binary,
um,
you know,

520
00:36:24.421 --> 00:36:26.010
I would assume they put them with the women.

521
00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:30.750
I think we need to build new prisons entirely.
You're right.
It makes sense.

522
00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:34.950
Makes Sense.
Yeah.
For the community.
No,
I think they do send them to the women's.

523
00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.990
I think it's to get the guys,
you know what it is,

524
00:36:36.991 --> 00:36:39.680
it's so that the guys don't get the shit beaten out of them with a,

525
00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.750
let's say I'm saying,
let's say I go,
Hey,
I'm non binary.

526
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:48.720
And then the state recognized it.
They go,
Tom Sigora non-binary,
right?

527
00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:53.100
It's on his driver then their driver's license.
Right.
And I commit a crime.
Right.

528
00:36:53.101 --> 00:36:56.730
I guess as the president and I go,
I'm not male.
I can't go to a men's prison.
No.

529
00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:59.880
They already had.
They already acknowledged that I'm not,
I'm not a man.

530
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:03.740
And you're not a female either.
No.
So I don't know,
Dude.

531
00:37:03.741 --> 00:37:07.500
And we'll have to figure what to find out.
Uh,
yeah.
Well,

532
00:37:07.501 --> 00:37:09.690
because this is such your wheelhouse.
Yeah.

533
00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:14.570
I thought I would just play this special treat diarrhea and nonbinary together.

534
00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:18.770
It's very educational.
Right?
And you're a reader and you're the learner.
Yeah.

535
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:21.390
But I think it's your type of education.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.

536
00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:22.651
<v 10>Hey everybody.</v>

537
00:37:22.651 --> 00:37:27.330
It's Steven's Seva here and I'm here to talk to you about something that's near

538
00:37:27.331 --> 00:37:31.550
and dear to my heart,
and I call it sacred releasing.
Okay.

539
00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.140
Here we go.
So what's sacred releasing is,

540
00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:37.050
is it's a way of transforming using the toilet,

541
00:37:37.051 --> 00:37:40.800
going to the bathroom from something that's mundane into something that's really

542
00:37:40.801 --> 00:37:43.350
magical,
transforming it into a sacred ritual,

543
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:46.540
<v 0>isn't it always?
I feel like it's always pretty awesome.</v>

544
00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.640
I think he points out one of your big flaws.

545
00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:53.350
<v 10>How present are you when you're going to the bathroom?</v>

546
00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:57.100
And the reason why we're asking that is because I know we have this tendency in

547
00:37:57.101 --> 00:38:00.820
our society in this day and age to be toilet textures.
You know,

548
00:38:00.821 --> 00:38:03.880
we go to the bathroom with a phone and then we can be sitting on the toilet.

549
00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:07.690
Showed up looking at her phone.
Yeah.
Yeah.

550
00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:12.820
That's why you were called releasing transforms and honors this.

551
00:38:12.821 --> 00:38:17.020
Letting go process is releasing process that is using the toilet.

552
00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:22.420
<v 0>This might be my second favorite new clip and the holy grail.
Sacred releasing.</v>

553
00:38:22.421 --> 00:38:24.610
I love that.
You definitely thought it was jizzing though,
right?
Yeah.

554
00:38:24.611 --> 00:38:26.550
I thought we were doing let her come.
Thank God.

555
00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:28.930
Why didn't even know this was an option for me.

556
00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:32.710
It's funny that you love shitting and I love jizzing.
Yeah,

557
00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:36.080
more shitting clips because I feel like we've been a little heavy.
Okay.

558
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.630
This is my wheelhouse now.

559
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:41.770
I thought that's why you took a shit was to catch up on your emails and your

560
00:38:41.771 --> 00:38:42.910
texts and your

561
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:55.000
sacred releasing,
so he's just arguing that you should be more present,

562
00:38:55.001 --> 00:38:56.860
more mindful,
more thoughtful,

563
00:38:56.861 --> 00:39:00.310
and more appreciative of your body processing that shit.
Yeah.

564
00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:02.920
Why are you sitting there doing other things?

565
00:39:02.921 --> 00:39:04.450
You should be thinking about this moment,

566
00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:09.310
but I feel like you process your dumps.
Yeah.

567
00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.460
You light candles and you pray.
I don't pray.

568
00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:17.560
I'm in there and I like a full report.
You tried it.

569
00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:22.330
In our spiritual communities.
People do this really beautiful,

570
00:39:22.331 --> 00:39:26.470
nice gratitude filled prayer,
like ritual,

571
00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:31.420
pre eating a meal and then when it comes out the other side on the phone,

572
00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:33.610
right.
Great logic.

573
00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:39.420
Why isn't that prayer happening on the toilet now that it's been digested?

574
00:39:39.641 --> 00:39:43.630
It's not good enough for you anymore.
It's an interesting topic.

575
00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:48.130
Should we be like,
I gotta take a shit and then be like,
dear God,
thank you.

576
00:39:48.131 --> 00:39:50.500
Thank you for,
thank you.
Right?
Yeah.
Thank you for this shit.

577
00:39:50.501 --> 00:39:55.330
Thank you for helping me get through my system and then kind of really losing

578
00:39:55.331 --> 00:39:59.560
yourself in it.
Like as it kind of pushes out,
especially those,

579
00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:01.000
those growlers,
you know,
those,

580
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:06.910
those really fierce ones.
I don't know.
I mean I think it was kind of interesting.

581
00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:11.560
I feel like there should be a whole sector of religious people there are devoted

582
00:40:11.561 --> 00:40:16.030
to this.
You know how there are like,
uh,
monks that starved themselves.

583
00:40:16.031 --> 00:40:19.910
I bet you there's a whole sect of people who just worshiped their duties.
Oh,

584
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:20.471
those people,

585
00:40:20.471 --> 00:40:25.471
there's some people that have other people worship their duties for people like

586
00:40:26.141 --> 00:40:29.470
her,
her buddy,
and they get in there.

587
00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.970
Do we have to be present all the time?
That's the question I would,

588
00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:35.650
I would ask him,
do listen,
taking a dump.

589
00:40:35.651 --> 00:40:40.030
It's probably one of the most enjoyably mindless things I get to do every day.

590
00:40:40.031 --> 00:40:41.470
That's why it's so awesome.

591
00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:45.400
It's you alone or sometimes with a toddler on your lap or a toddler running

592
00:40:45.401 --> 00:40:47.830
around,
but mostly alone,

593
00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:53.410
or you check out and you just enjoy a body function.
Why do I have to fucking,

594
00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:56.530
can we just be mindless?
Yeah,
totally.

595
00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:03.460
Leave it in a different room and just set it aside and don't even go to the

596
00:41:03.461 --> 00:41:04.294
bathroom with your phone.

597
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:09.250
What I'm encouraging and supporting you to do is to leave the phone out of the

598
00:41:09.251 --> 00:41:10.420
banks completely,

599
00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:14.140
and what I encourage you to do is just drop in with yourself and let this be a

600
00:41:14.141 --> 00:41:16.570
moment where you honor the sacred,

601
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:20.600
bringing in and letting go process that is this sacred rhythm that we have in,

602
00:41:20.601 --> 00:41:24.010
in,
in life and in the universe.
Kind of a beautiful statement though.

603
00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:28.960
I like his earrings.
Those are unique.
They're,
they're alternative.

604
00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:33.200
Like they look spice,
the spiky and hurtful.
Like they look like they hurt.
Yeah.

605
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:38.660
I'm getting my ears pierced.
Both of them.
Yeah.
That's a really good idea.

606
00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.540
You don't like it?
I didn't say I didn't like it.

607
00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:45.470
You said it was a really good idea,
but I sensed like some type of,

608
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:49.160
you know what kind of,
what kind of earrings are you going to get?
Um,

609
00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:52.040
I'm going to start with gold studs.
Yeah,
definitely.

610
00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:56.000
And hold on and then I'm going to,
uh,

611
00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.150
I'll do hoops and then I'm gonna do diamonds.

612
00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:05.380
I'm just gonna diamonds on you.
You look good.
You think so.
Spark,
spark.

613
00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:07.880
You know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to get a tattoo.

614
00:42:07.881 --> 00:42:09.600
I've been talking about it for a long time.
Okay.

615
00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:13.940
I want to get those knuckle tats.
We've been talking about,
oh yeah.

616
00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:15.540
Says Fuck you money on there.

617
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:20.000
I think you should have fucking money before you get it true.
That's a problem.

618
00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:20.953
It'd be funny there.

619
00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:25.280
You're doing your next special and it's like fuck you pull in the mic.

620
00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:26.780
Like it'd be great.
Whoa.

621
00:42:26.781 --> 00:42:29.930
Seinfeld had those for this late last special and they said,

622
00:42:29.931 --> 00:42:32.330
fuck you money on his hands.
I'd be like,
that's awesome,

623
00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:37.320
but I think you don't want to get that tat.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

624
00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.430
But I do like those knuckle tats that's going to happen in this lifetime and I

625
00:42:40.431 --> 00:42:42.230
feel like you want a tat.
You've been talking about it.

626
00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:47.060
It's my like midlife crisis thing.
I've been reverting to my God stuff a lot,

627
00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:52.120
but I do.
I kind of want to tat dude,
is there any place you're considering?
Yeah,

628
00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:56.570
the inner arm,
inner forum,
the forum.
The problem is,

629
00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:59.720
is that I feel like in 10 years when I'm a 50 year old woman,

630
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:02.690
I'll feel like a dick bag.
I don't think so.
I feel like a fucking,

631
00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:03.740
I really don't think so.

632
00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:07.010
You don't think it'll be undignified when I'm like 81st of all,

633
00:43:07.011 --> 00:43:08.270
you have to have it tastefully done.

634
00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:13.500
You have to have it done by a good artist and there's definitely a dignified way

635
00:43:14.061 --> 00:43:16.970
of doing it.
One.
If it's a sacred poop,

636
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:21.130
like my favorite poop.
What do you mean third?

637
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:24.770
You don't have a favorite bowel movement.
You're saying you're going to date it,

638
00:43:24.771 --> 00:43:29.150
commemorate it,
so you'll be like eight,
16 people will be like,
oh,

639
00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:31.520
someone die.
But like,
no,
it's my favorite.
Dot.

640
00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:36.850
Aren't you already have the message in mind?
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh,
I want Mike,

641
00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:39.410
my kid's name or something.
Yeah.
My son,

642
00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:43.730
my son and I are saying definitely portraits of our dogs too.

643
00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:46.910
I want you to have his face always looks good when somebody has their child's

644
00:43:46.911 --> 00:43:51.710
face tattooed on them.
Never looks bad.
No always looks good.
No forever.

645
00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:53.390
Forever.
My child,
he'll be like,

646
00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:57.860
then as your skin changes and it looks like he was in some type of chemical

647
00:43:57.861 --> 00:43:58.850
warfare and accident,

648
00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:04.570
I do like a trident or an octopus or something like that and octopus and like a

649
00:44:04.761 --> 00:44:08.150
cool one.
Maybe shelve your idea for a while,

650
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:12.410
2030 years and revisit it.
I know.
That's why I get the urge.
Then I'm like,

651
00:44:12.411 --> 00:44:15.200
I should hold off.
I like your idea.
I think it'll look cool.
Well,

652
00:44:15.201 --> 00:44:18.950
I had the bad idea in the 90s of getting a fucking tramp stamp of a dragon.

653
00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:23.150
Look how that one aim here thing.
Yeah.
I hate it.
Now.

654
00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:27.470
Thing is though.
Do I go through the pain of removing it or do I just like fuck.

655
00:44:27.471 --> 00:44:31.340
It just depends on how much it bothers you.
It's embarrassing.

656
00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:36.810
Remove it.
Yeah.
But I think the one you have in mind is actually cool.

657
00:44:36.811 --> 00:44:41.100
I really do.
My Kid's name.
I think it's an old English though.
Yeah.

658
00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:45.600
My chest,
chest.
I would do pause.

659
00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:49.200
I love the Paul has those.
Yeah.

660
00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:51.840
Those are rather fucking super aware.
Right?

661
00:44:51.841 --> 00:44:56.530
Why the why the why the cat paws on her chest.
I always wondered.
It's um,

662
00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:01.880
shows you fun times
kid.
He plays with tidier.

663
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:05.190
That's the whole idea.
It's like,
wait,
your cat steps on your chest.

664
00:45:05.191 --> 00:45:08.350
And she's like,
commemorating when the cat steps are.
Yeah,
exactly.
You know,

665
00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:12.690
when bitsy steps.
So I think just getting you to look at Teddy's,
it's just fun.

666
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.360
There's,
don't you look though,
don't you slut.
Shame me.

667
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:20.480
You look at my titties because I have tattoos on him.
There's a lot of,

668
00:45:20.481 --> 00:45:23.280
uh,
my favorite,
I've seen a lot of tattoos.

669
00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:28.310
Like if you kind of go down rabbit holes of horrifically terrifying one's near

670
00:45:29.161 --> 00:45:30.960
genitals,
it's pretty crazy.

671
00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:36.320
You don't talking about like people have like the devil tattoo above their box.

672
00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:41.430
So it looks like the devil choice is your Vjo Jay.

673
00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:45.780
Oof.
It's such a choice.
Um,
crazy ones.

674
00:45:45.781 --> 00:45:48.300
Like one guy had a poison,

675
00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:53.580
the word poison tattooed on his Dong and then an arrow pointing towards the tip.

676
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:57.920
Like that's pretty fast.
That's crazy talk,
God damn.

677
00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:00.240
Or there's a real,
there's,
if you go,

678
00:46:00.241 --> 00:46:04.620
I mean they're all over but like crazy asshole ones where it's some,

679
00:46:04.621 --> 00:46:08.220
something demonic and then the,
the,
your asshole is,

680
00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:13.250
is it's drawn on there so that you're assholes the mouth.
So it's like,
ah,

681
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:16.500
it's like a crazy dean.
And then your mouth,
the mouth is,
yeah,
I mean like,

682
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:19.830
I don't know.
And then people will put like funny things,
you know,

683
00:46:19.831 --> 00:46:23.520
around their assholes,
which I guess I appreciate it as a comedian.
Sure.

684
00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:25.290
And just as a human being,

685
00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:29.850
but you're also getting your asshole tattooed wild thing I think about is that,

686
00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:34.500
I mean,
listen,
I've only had the tramp stamp and that wasn't comfortable.

687
00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:39.030
Yeah.
But I can't imagine the asshole being an easy place to tattoo.

688
00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:43.530
It's gotta be,
it's gotta be nuts.
Yeah.
Might be the most sensitive.

689
00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:47.400
Besides your genitals or your eye eyelids.

690
00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:49.440
I don't even know how they give eyelid tattoos.

691
00:46:49.441 --> 00:46:52.620
I've seen those on television very often in real life.

692
00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.510
Just on those crime shows.

693
00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:59.970
There's some inmates with soon eyelids I've seen,
um,
you know,

694
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:02.210
whole face is just nuts.
Wild

695
00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:07.460
inner lip of seeing the,
you know.
Yeah.

696
00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:10.230
But so bad that doesn't last forever.
You know,

697
00:47:10.231 --> 00:47:13.950
that I've seen a bottom of a foot tattooed,
which I'm like,
this just has,

698
00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:16.090
you know,
that's just for you,
for your amusement.

699
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:21.090
But also I feel like that would be painful and not good.
Super painful.

700
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:26.110
Um,
but I feel like,
yeah,
face is pretty crazy.
The neck,

701
00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:28.920
actually I do like a chess piece.
I like it,

702
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:32.220
it on girls when I see it looks really tough.
I like it.

703
00:47:32.221 --> 00:47:37.210
You like the toughness of it?
Yeah.
Yeah,
like throat,
throat and stuff to,
actually,

704
00:47:37.211 --> 00:47:42.211
there was a drug dealer that I went to college with and he had throat cancer and

705
00:47:42.641 --> 00:47:46.090
he had like,
he was like a white guy with dreads,
but he wore,

706
00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:49.190
he rode a motorcycle like he was,
he was tough as fuck.
Actually,

707
00:47:49.191 --> 00:47:52.360
he had the knuckle tats the neck.
I mean,
but some dudes,

708
00:47:52.361 --> 00:47:55.540
it's like they're born that way.
Like they look good.
This guy was hot.

709
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:59.890
Everyone wanted to bang him with his dreads.
That's where you lost me.

710
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:06.760
Everybody did duty white guy with dreads.
I'm telling you,
it's very rare,

711
00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:09.470
but this boy was so Goddamn,
he,

712
00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:13.960
you know how like a dude figures out a look and you're like thousands look,
dude,

713
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:16.540
knuckle tattoos,
throat dreads,
blonde,

714
00:48:16.541 --> 00:48:21.130
like bleached white and then looked good.
Yes.
I'm saying,

715
00:48:21.131 --> 00:48:25.060
and I don't say this,
I'll never say it again.
Maybe Rob Zombie can pull it off.

716
00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:30.390
And this guy.
So did you guys make love?
I wish.
No,
but my roommate,
uh,

717
00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:34.570
at one point did the one who I would predict would have knowing the for the

718
00:48:34.571 --> 00:48:37.390
roommates,
no,
you don't want to even know this girl.
No,
no,
no.
She,

719
00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:41.830
you wouldn't even know her stories.
She felt she fall in love with him,

720
00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:45.370
the campus drug dealer.
And then he was like,
Nah.

721
00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:49.300
Cause he had this really cute girlfriend that he was with and he kinda cheated

722
00:48:49.301 --> 00:48:52.590
on the girl with
dreads.

723
00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:58.720
Even had like a hot ass friend,
you know,
and like hot dudes.
They were all like,

724
00:48:58.721 --> 00:49:03.160
they're best friends.
Hot.
But the thing is they were like 25 at the time.

725
00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:03.941
You know what I'm saying?

726
00:49:03.941 --> 00:49:07.270
Like I was a freshman in college and these dudes were like 25 and still in

727
00:49:07.271 --> 00:49:11.020
college and dealing drugs.
I know that lane well because I'm one of those guys

728
00:49:13.210 --> 00:49:17.470
I walk in,
it's like me,
Josh Potter,
you know.

729
00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:21.970
Ah,
hey.
Yeah,
we're super hot.

730
00:49:21.971 --> 00:49:26.330
Sickler which is how we roll because we know the posters.

731
00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:28.900
We got to knock that shit down.
Yeah.

732
00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:31.630
Fuck all this time.

733
00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:35.830
I can't even imagine what that's like as a young man to be that guy.

734
00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:40.420
All the girls want to bang.
Yeah,
it's probably overwhelming.
I'm assuming.

735
00:49:40.421 --> 00:49:43.870
I'm sure you had hepatitis or something.
He was probably nasty as hell.

736
00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:48.750
You wasn't clean.
Definitely.
He did his best life.
I mean,
think about,

737
00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:53.710
he's got a motorcycle.
He got a throat tattoo money.
Definitely bad decision.

738
00:49:53.711 --> 00:49:56.230
I don't care about the hair where you think it's a bad decision.

739
00:49:56.380 --> 00:50:00.700
So he made a bad decision,
but he embraced it.
Yeah,
he's got,
he's selling drugs.

740
00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:05.980
All the checks likes it and box.
Yeah.
Girlfriend was hot.
He's fucking,

741
00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:07.870
he lived his best life.
He did.

742
00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:10.600
It'd be awesome if you could get an update on him right now.

743
00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:13.960
Whoever he went to school with me and you're listening.

744
00:50:13.961 --> 00:50:16.330
You know who I'm talking about.
If you can text some friends

745
00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:22.840
I know.
Who knows.
Get a look,
get a gander of what's going on.

746
00:50:22.841 --> 00:50:27.290
Now if he's alive,
he's,
I would say he was on the fast track to dying.
You see?

747
00:50:27.291 --> 00:50:28.850
Right.
Because he did a lot of the bad drugs.

748
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:33.440
I do not have an update on the hot friend.
Sarah sent it to me.

749
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:37.520
He's not hot anymore.
He is.
He is,
yeah.

750
00:50:37.521 --> 00:50:40.700
He's Pudgy and like,
he's like everybody now middle aged.

751
00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:44.180
There's a window for that kind of Shit,
dude.
You got to get your tap.

752
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:45.820
You're going to regret not getting your tongue.

753
00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:49.820
I feel like that's what this whole thing was about you to get your tat man.

754
00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:52.880
You're saying I should have slept with the campus drug dealer 200% if you would

755
00:50:52.881 --> 00:50:54.710
have had that story right now,
I would have loved it.

756
00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:59.150
I didn't do anything sexually adventurous.
Dude.
He,

757
00:50:59.210 --> 00:51:03.440
he did things to me like I had never heard of and like it hurt but like,

758
00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:07.450
and I cried a lot but it was like,
it was still good.
Yeah.
You know?
Sure.

759
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:11.930
And then there's hot friend came in and I was,
I was airtight stop yourself.

760
00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:17.090
I was talking about,
I feel like this whole thing about,
you know,

761
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:19.730
were we allowed the more we should just slot walk,

762
00:51:19.731 --> 00:51:21.080
everyone's allowed to be a whore.

763
00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:23.120
I feel like we've always been allowed to be a hard,

764
00:51:23.121 --> 00:51:27.020
like I don't know of course what these uptight girls are like in the 90s all my

765
00:51:27.021 --> 00:51:30.300
friends were sluts.
It's all the ones doing it.

766
00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:34.790
There's people who have their,
they have insecurities about being the whore.

767
00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:35.683
In other words,

768
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:40.690
they're judging that girl that sleeps around and they feel weird about it,

769
00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:43.960
but they want to be as comfortable as she is with it.
Cause I'm like,
Yo,

770
00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:45.650
where everyone loves whores.

771
00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:50.120
Well my friends were hose and all every nobody talk shit to them know everyone

772
00:51:50.121 --> 00:51:50.490
loves it.

773
00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:54.170
And especially in San Francisco when I went to college it was like cool.

774
00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:54.861
It was cool.

775
00:51:54.861 --> 00:51:57.950
No one fucking slack chain people felt like it was like hanging outside of a

776
00:51:57.951 --> 00:52:01.580
bakery and like,
they're like,
we're gonna,
we're going to run out of,
uh,

777
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.840
we have too many cupcakes leftover and would just be like,

778
00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:09.770
what if I hang out with me?
But you'll get one of those cupcakes.
It's like that.

779
00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:14.990
Yeah.
That's,
and I went to an all girls Catholic high school.

780
00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:16.610
We were so sex positive.

781
00:52:16.611 --> 00:52:20.450
Like I remember in 10th grade our friend gave her first blow job.

782
00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:24.680
She came in the next day and announced it and we all fucking high fiber.

783
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:29.480
Nobody was like,
oh you're a whore.
Like yeah of course we loved that stuff.

784
00:52:29.481 --> 00:52:32.060
I think cause let's get through this cause we got to get LJ here I fuck.

785
00:52:32.650 --> 00:52:35.470
<v 10>So this is how we do it.
There's a few steps to this process.</v>

786
00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:39.550
Step number one is it involves going to the bathroom.
We engage an intention,

787
00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:43.810
we bring in a visualization,
we do a form of toning.

788
00:52:43.811 --> 00:52:46.360
Can I just take a shit actually like making a sound.

789
00:52:47.350 --> 00:52:52.350
A quick hit about the sound is to flush things down or energy channel and our

790
00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:53.740
route.

791
00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:58.740
It's helpful if we make a sound and if we're bringing things up through the

792
00:52:58.841 --> 00:53:00.250
upper shockers and hold our crown,

793
00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:05.400
we want to make a higher tone and so we can use this toning tool to help us move

794
00:53:06.191 --> 00:53:08.170
excess energy in her body that might not be serving.

795
00:53:10.090 --> 00:53:11.950
I feel like I make that sound already when I should,

796
00:53:12.550 --> 00:53:17.260
oh this guy lives alone.
Use the low tone.

797
00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:22.420
When we go to the bathroom or root area is not only opening up physically to let

798
00:53:22.421 --> 00:53:26.100
things go,
but it's also opening up energetically to let go.
Right,
and so

799
00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:26.850
<v 0>those,</v>

800
00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:31.800
once this energetic centers open and we're releasing physically and

801
00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:34.260
energetically,
this guy align this with our intention.

802
00:53:34.261 --> 00:53:37.800
I'm going to let go of some anxiety that I'm feeling in my belly,
like help it,

803
00:53:37.801 --> 00:53:39.990
encourage it down.
He's sweet.
He goes,

804
00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:44.280
but he goes through all of this to take it a shit.
His life is too complicated.

805
00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:48.660
He definitely lives by himself.
Important is because we're opening up physically.

806
00:53:48.661 --> 00:53:50.330
Yes,
energetically raised.

807
00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:54.300
It's important to that when we're done and complete our sacred releasing ritual

808
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:57.590
that we close the energy energy sector,

809
00:53:57.670 --> 00:54:02.330
your asshole energy loves to leak out.
We've heard about this phenomenon.

810
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.810
Yeah.
It does.
The leaky energy problem,
especially with women,

811
00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:09.480
like you got to close that door,
close your badge.

812
00:54:09.481 --> 00:54:11.830
You can easily leak out of our routine.
Okay.

813
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:17.770
<v 3>If we're not
adding the blue abundance</v>

814
00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:24.600
and so by the beach,
it's an APP.

815
00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:27.190
That energy center

816
00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:34.590
you're saying,

817
00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:44.160
yeah,
I get it now you got all that energy.

818
00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:48.440
You're saying the king has or we've been practicing this for year and let's

819
00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:52.030
listen to that breathing currently

820
00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:57.400
appreciating what he ate and letting it all out and then closing.

821
00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:02.440
We were gay so he did.
Right.

822
00:55:02.441 --> 00:55:06.640
So kick ass rapper for non you haters.
Yeah,
it's a nice part on the haters.

823
00:55:07.330 --> 00:55:12.320
<v 0>All the haters.
He's an intentional farther into shit.
Yeah.
Yup.</v>

824
00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:13.211
I mean he's been doing,

825
00:55:13.211 --> 00:55:17.440
he's been mindful duding for a long time before this guy has really been doing

826
00:55:17.441 --> 00:55:22.060
it.
Um,
oh my God,
that was great.
That was fantastic.
We know more dump clips.

827
00:55:22.061 --> 00:55:25.600
Really.
I feel like,
I feel like this really lifted my spirits.

828
00:55:25.601 --> 00:55:26.650
This is what I needed today.

829
00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:30.400
Thank you so much for really bringing the clips that I would respond to you.

830
00:55:30.401 --> 00:55:35.050
Yeah.
I'm glad.
Thank you.
Blue Band and um,
yeah,
I really feel like,

831
00:55:35.051 --> 00:55:38.610
uh,
it's very exciting.
So normally we would have had

832
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:40.210
<v 4>Martin Risa together,</v>

833
00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:45.410
but we don't cause a of our circumstances.
So jealous.

834
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:46.481
That's what you're going to see.

835
00:55:46.481 --> 00:55:50.820
Now if you keep watching this podcast or keep listening,
we're,

836
00:55:50.830 --> 00:55:55.830
we're going to tack on a segment where Martin brought presence was I don't want

837
00:55:56.351 --> 00:55:58.060
to give away yet.
Um,

838
00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:01.690
and he also brought three new waters to try,

839
00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:05.350
which I have to get you to try them.
It's not like a site.
And then,
um,
that's it.

840
00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:08.090
It should be really fun.
So,
uh,

841
00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:11.950
thank you to Martin Risa for coming in and go to the Patina restaurant downtown

week,

All right,

847
00:56:27.761 --> 00:56:32.560
this is a nice treat for us.
Uh,
in this case,
particularly me,

848
00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:36.820
um,
because I don't know if,
well we,
I'm sure we discussed it during the episode,

849
00:56:36.821 --> 00:56:41.320
but um,
we have no,
we had a nanny called in sick today,

850
00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:42.700
which happens,
that's life.

851
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:48.270
So I the more important a true water champ of the family,

852
00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:54.600
I'm going to enjoy some nice new waters were being revisited by Martin Resa,

853
00:56:57.250 --> 00:57:01.970
the water somewhere.
Yay.
Um,
the international number one water somewhere.

854
00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:06.430
Yay.
Who um,
also you can,
you can visit if you'd like to.

855
00:57:06.431 --> 00:57:11.431
You can go and they can make a reservation and eat at a Patina right.

856
00:57:11.681 --> 00:57:14.830
Patina restaurant in downtown Los Angeles and the Lord is a concert hall.
Yeah.

857
00:57:14.831 --> 00:57:18.670
I'm always there for you.
And actually we had some guests who saw me,

858
00:57:18.671 --> 00:57:22.060
he on the show last time coming over and out to Patina and there was a lot of

859
00:57:22.061 --> 00:57:22.360
fun,

860
00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:26.260
really do some walnut tasting with them and they really enjoyed it and a lot of

861
00:57:26.261 --> 00:57:30.100
fun.
It's a fun experience.
I feel like that was the,
um,
it was a funny episode.

862
00:57:30.101 --> 00:57:32.440
Like when you participate,
when you came over the first time,

863
00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:36.910
all these people were like,
what the fuck are you doing having this guy on?

864
00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:38.110
I think this is totally normal.

865
00:57:38.111 --> 00:57:40.720
Even I'm getting the same response in the restaurant all the time.

866
00:57:40.721 --> 00:57:43.270
It's like when you're giving them water manual or telling them I'm a water,

867
00:57:43.271 --> 00:57:46.030
somebody they think like,
yeah,
right.
Yeah,
right.
What's wrong with you?

868
00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:49.240
But then they were all fascinated like,
and I,
I've been on this uh,

869
00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:54.250
thing too where,
you know,
I travel a lot.
I'm meeting people all the time.

870
00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:56.710
Sometimes water comes up,

871
00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:59.710
it always comes up when somebody grabs a water.

872
00:57:59.711 --> 00:58:03.910
Like let's say I'm going from the hotel or the airports to the hotel.

873
00:58:04.330 --> 00:58:08.350
And then the,
uh,
you know,
the show runner,
the person that runs the,
the,
the,

874
00:58:08.351 --> 00:58:09.680
the theater runner who like,

875
00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:12.550
will run to help you run errands the day you're in town.

876
00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:17.260
We'll stop in and then I'll see them pick up like a bottle of smartwater.

877
00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:20.530
I'll be like,
Nah,
man,
you can't do that.
And they're like,
what?
I'm like,

878
00:58:20.650 --> 00:58:22.600
that's garbage,
dude.
Throw that shit out.

879
00:58:23.110 --> 00:58:25.750
And then we started having talks about minerals.
I,

880
00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:29.950
it becomes this fascinating thing where it's almost like there's so many things

881
00:58:30.730 --> 00:58:34.630
in life that are convenient to not know that you just go,
like,

882
00:58:34.631 --> 00:58:38.130
I don't have time to care about everything.
Yeah.
Um,

883
00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:40.300
but then there's certain things where you go,
well,

884
00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:44.200
it's important enough for me to,
to give a shit about.

885
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:47.900
So especially I think when you're putting something into your body,
yeah,

886
00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:50.950
I think you should really think about what you're putting into your body.

887
00:58:51.010 --> 00:58:55.330
Of course,
it's very,
very important.
Water is pretty essential,
I think.
Yeah.

888
00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:59.410
I think it's,
you see the,
an artist made this.
Oh,
that is cool.
I mean,

889
00:58:59.411 --> 00:59:03.010
look at that.
They're just awesome.
That is this,

890
00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:07.270
it says the water champion.
He's sculpted that whole thing.
Incredible.

891
00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:11.170
That is really awesome.
Yeah.
I love this.
Yeah.
Um,
yeah.

892
00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:14.410
Well there's some additional factors.

893
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:19.000
So gaming someone.
Yeah.
You got a lot of traction.
I mean,
you know,

894
00:59:19.001 --> 00:59:23.910
from the podcast,
a lot of people into that.
Did you get,
um,

895
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:27.350
some fun,
interesting messages and,
uh,
emails from

896
00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:30.640
<v 11>people?
Uh,
the first thing,
and I was like completely shocked,</v>

897
00:59:30.641 --> 00:59:34.450
obviously when the first guy said hi Hitler.
And I was like,
what the hell?

898
00:59:34.451 --> 00:59:36.760
What did I do on the show?
And I didn't know.

899
00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:40.870
And then I realized because I watched more and more episodes and then I
realized,

900
00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:45.370
oh no,
I'm getting it.
You're like,
there's,
it's not just me.

901
00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:49.870
It's not just me.
I'm not just because I'm can perfectly say high,
hit low.

902
00:59:49.871 --> 00:59:53.170
Obviously I'm an accent,
but uh,
now are getting it.

903
00:59:53.171 --> 00:59:56.470
And this was obviously a little shocking in the beginning for five Norris

904
00:59:56.471 --> 00:59:58.930
getting,
now I'm getting it and I'm totally fine with us.

905
01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:04.030
<v 4>Yeah.
She,
she's pretty wild.</v>

906
01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:08.880
She's got,

907
01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.770
<v 11>she's got problems.
She has serious problems.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

908
01:00:12.050 --> 01:00:16.040
Nobody was really fun too to be on the shore and I never thought I getting so

909
01:00:16.041 --> 01:00:19.550
much response out of that.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I've gained hundreds of followers.

910
01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.800
Suddenly people were all over me.

911
01:00:21.801 --> 01:00:25.400
They sent me text messages as I'm still getting Instagram posts all the time now

912
01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:28.580
and tagging you with the water,
tagging me with their water,

913
01:00:28.581 --> 01:00:31.100
they're drinking and ask me,
hey,
what do you think about this?

914
01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:34.900
What do you think about that water?
And I'm trying obviously my best always to,

915
01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:38.340
to response to everybody.
That's great.
And,
and saying like,
Hey,
cool.
Well,

916
01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:41.570
thank you so much for thinking about me and I love this.
This is so cool.

917
01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:45.980
And this is the one idea I think we want to engage with people when I talk about

918
01:00:45.981 --> 01:00:47.810
water and I want to get water value.

919
01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.200
That's the whole point why I was on the first place here as well and what it

920
01:00:51.201 --> 01:00:55.220
should be fun and water should be enjoyable and,
and it's,
it's great to be back.

921
01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:59.890
<v 4>Well good.
I'm so happy to have you back.
Um,
and I really feel like too,
it's like,</v>

922
01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:04.930
it's one of those things where with water it is something you engage with every

923
01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:08.350
day.
So like even all the jokes aside from our podcast,
I mean,

924
01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:11.020
you're gonna have water every day.
I mean,
we are,

925
01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:16.620
and I feel like you coming on just opened my eyes to the possibilities and to

926
01:01:18.311 --> 01:01:22.000
the information,
like the education of it.
So it's been fascinating for me,
man.

927
01:01:22.001 --> 01:01:25.990
Like I,
I really do think about it now when I'm in these,
like I said,

928
01:01:25.991 --> 01:01:30.510
all over the country,
different cities have different options.
Where was it?

929
01:01:30.511 --> 01:01:35.490
I was just in Texas.
And um,
when I went to,
where was that?

930
01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:39.970
It was either in,
I think it was when I was in San Antonio.
San Antonio.
Yeah,

931
01:01:39.971 --> 01:01:42.490
it was,
I went to this pretty nice restaurant.

932
01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:46.210
We're having a pre show meal and the guy's like,
you know,

933
01:01:46.211 --> 01:01:48.780
they're trying to sell us their cocktails.
And I was like,
well,

934
01:01:48.790 --> 01:01:52.360
we're going to do show.
So I said,
I just want sparkling water.
And he goes,

935
01:01:52.361 --> 01:01:56.320
do you want a Pellegrino or uh,
Buh,
Buh,
Buh.
And something I hadn't heard.

936
01:01:56.321 --> 01:02:00.130
And I go,
what's that?
And he goes,
what's that?
He goes,
oh,

937
01:02:00.131 --> 01:02:02.680
that's a Mexican sparkling water.
Topo Chico.

938
01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:07.270
It's a staple of maybe San Antonio or whatever.
And I got Topo Chico.
Okay,

939
01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:11.770
great.
Cool.
Spocky will I go look that shit up man,
let's have some Mexican spot.

940
01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:15.520
So it was like a fun,
you know,
normally,
I don't even know if you,

941
01:02:15.521 --> 01:02:20.130
if you hadn't been here and kind of talked about trying

942
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:22.800
<v 11>stuff,
I may have just been like,
I don't know what that is.</v>

943
01:02:22.801 --> 01:02:23.670
I'll take a pellet green out.

944
01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:28.590
But I now I try to experiment and try to have a little more then you'd just been

945
01:02:28.591 --> 01:02:32.070
through sober October.
I know man.
Well and first of all,

946
01:02:32.071 --> 01:02:36.190
your relationships to your house.
I believe that.
Yeah.

947
01:02:36.270 --> 01:02:38.190
But I think even for people who were saying like,
okay,

948
01:02:38.191 --> 01:02:42.150
I want to be a whole month without alcohol.
They are other options for you.
Sure.

949
01:02:42.151 --> 01:02:46.860
And it's not just about or other option means like sodas or juices or something

950
01:02:46.861 --> 01:02:50.070
like that.
Yeah,
no water has options as well.
And there was some really,

951
01:02:50.071 --> 01:02:53.160
really cool stuff on it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that is a fun thing.
Oh my God.

952
01:02:53.161 --> 01:02:57.390
I drink so much water on Thursday night.
I went to this,

953
01:02:57.391 --> 01:03:02.391
a place that had a speakeasy attached to it and they have,

954
01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:04.140
they're like a bourbon bar,

955
01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:07.770
Bourbon whiskeys and everything and they're having me tried Japanese whiskeys

956
01:03:07.771 --> 01:03:11.570
and all this shit.
I mean,
after about an hour and a half.
Yeah.

957
01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:14.790
Yeah.
Very cool stuff.
Yeah.
I have this,
this is why the restaurant,

958
01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:17.190
after an hour and a half of that,
I was like,
hey man,

959
01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:18.390
I need to start dragging some water.

960
01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:22.510
And I think I had like 11 glasses of water before I left here.

961
01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:27.330
We have order champagne and I was also becoming the drunk champ.
So I was like,

962
01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:32.340
I actually felt somewhat okay the next morning I think because I just pounded

963
01:03:32.341 --> 01:03:33.730
why it's important.
Yeah.

964
01:03:33.930 --> 01:03:36.580
The thing is what a lot of people always don't think like they're thinking,
oh,

965
01:03:36.581 --> 01:03:40.290
I call it makes your dehydrated.
That's actually not really true.
Right.

966
01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:44.310
Our goal is to make you more going to the restroom.
Yeah.
That's the reason.

967
01:03:44.311 --> 01:03:47.150
That's the whole point.
Why you're dehydrating.
Because if you're going,

968
01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:48.330
you'll keep going,
keep going,

969
01:03:48.331 --> 01:03:50.550
keep going the whole time and you're forgetting maybe to drink water.

970
01:03:50.790 --> 01:03:54.060
So when you replenish yourself all the time with some good mineral water,

971
01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:59.250
there will be no hangover the next day.
Really.
It will be fine.
I'll be fine.
Um,

972
01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:04.170
I'm,
I'm very,
very tempted to just grab stuff.

973
01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:08.480
I'm so excited.
You brought three to try today.
I bef uh,
yeah,

974
01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:10.200
I brought three different voters,

975
01:04:10.201 --> 01:04:13.500
but before that I have a little present for you.
Oh,
okay.
And

976
01:04:15.570 --> 01:04:19.230
is this what you,
the file you sent me or no.
So the first present,

977
01:04:19.231 --> 01:04:20.990
and this is actually a foil,
um,

978
01:04:21.030 --> 01:04:25.160
because you'd get the whole Lamborghini prank and I love this.
Yeah.

979
01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:28.650
And before that you told me you will the hatch amp no as well.
That's right.

980
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:32.490
That's right.
And I know your addiction to cars.
Yeah.
And I have to admit,

981
01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:36.110
I love cars.
Tours are fun,
man.
I ordered something from Germany for Ya.
What?

982
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:38.910
And I think this will be a perfect little present.

983
01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:43.740
So I get you're the perfect Martini racing Porsche.

984
01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:48.690
I love it for you.
Yeah.
If you're a gentlemen,
thank you sir.

985
01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:52.190
So I think there will be a nice thing,
especially when the sun is blowing.
Yeah.

986
01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:56.640
And this will be a great head for bio when you're driving your,
your nice car.

987
01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:57.653
Thank you,
sir.

988
01:04:58.970 --> 01:05:01.040
<v 3>Let me see.
Try it right away.</v>

989
01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:05.450
<v 11>Maybe you need to change in the back or something else too.</v>

990
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:07.780
That's very nice of you.
Thank you for did.
I thought like I,

991
01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:11.590
I saw that and I feel like this is the perfect gift for Tom.
Yes.

992
01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:13.773
<v 3>Okay.</v>

993
01:05:13.930 --> 01:05:18.520
<v 11>There we go.
Dude.
Tell me,

It looks perfect.
Yeah,
love this.
Love it.</v>

994
01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:22.870
And then I brought something for you both and I have a little video as well,

995
01:05:22.871 --> 01:05:27.130
but I want to show case first what I brought because obviously I'm working in a

996
01:05:27.131 --> 01:05:28.150
restaurant.
Yeah.
Yeah.

997
01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:31.600
And you guys talking all the time about eating stuff is spot on the show.

998
01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:35.093
<v 6>Hmm.</v>

999
01:05:35.790 --> 01:05:37.890
<v 11>I brought more soup.
What,</v>

1000
01:05:38.490 --> 01:05:41.070
what you brought real moose soup,

1001
01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:45.450
real moose soup created yesterday by my Michelin Star Chef Andrea swollen.

1002
01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:49.290
And I have a video here where you can see where we created this yesterday.

1003
01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:54.970
Holy Cow.
The real move soup for the main mommies.
Oh Man,

1004
01:05:56.490 --> 01:06:00.480
this is unbelievable.
Oh my God.
Hold on.

1005
01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:04.110
This is an bubbly,
you did not even tell me you were doing this by the way,

1006
01:06:04.111 --> 01:06:08.730
cause otherwise I would have had this.
No,
no,
that's the reason.
Yes.
Here we go.

1007
01:06:08.970 --> 01:06:09.721
I just sent,

1008
01:06:09.721 --> 01:06:12.630
and this is the reason I just send you the link via Dropbox because I didn't

1009
01:06:12.631 --> 01:06:15.660
know that you were sneaking on me and like how,
what is he sending me?

1010
01:06:15.661 --> 01:06:18.360
Like let's check it out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Then I wouldn't have that surprise.

1011
01:06:18.361 --> 01:06:21.540
So it was for me important to get some moose in the beginning.

1012
01:06:21.541 --> 01:06:24.990
And obviously some people will see like what the hell is this year?
Why is it,

1013
01:06:24.991 --> 01:06:27.150
Martin has like this crazy bunch here,

1014
01:06:27.151 --> 01:06:29.910
but this is like how we are presenting or preserving actually stuff at the

1015
01:06:29.911 --> 01:06:34.530
restaurant.
So we cooking everything and then it goes into a vacuum.

1016
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:39.030
Yeah.
And then it will be staying perfectly for,
I cannot believe you're a genius.

1017
01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:42.340
So this is actually real good moose suit from uh,

1018
01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:45.780
the Moose is coming from Vermont actually freshly flow.
This is today.

1019
01:06:45.781 --> 01:06:48.810
This is Moose suit for resists real.
Moosup okay.

1020
01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:53.370
I think we're going to lose our minds.
Um,
so should I open it up?
Sure,
sure.
Yeah,

1021
01:06:53.371 --> 01:06:57.450
definitely.
Okay,
well it's a little video so there's no really sound,
so you can,

1022
01:06:57.451 --> 01:07:00.030
you can move the sound but adjust a little video

1023
01:07:02.130 --> 01:07:05.570
about where we actually own.
So it's mostly Patina style.

1024
01:07:05.571 --> 01:07:09.000
This cause it's funny cause I was about to say to you that like we should tell

1025
01:07:09.001 --> 01:07:12.780
the audience what caliber restaurant.
So it's a Michelin Star restaurant.

1026
01:07:12.781 --> 01:07:14.700
It's one of the flagships,
what we operating,

1027
01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:17.100
it's the number one restaurant in Los Angeles.

1028
01:07:17.101 --> 01:07:19.140
And this is Andrea Ralo execute a chef.

1029
01:07:19.590 --> 01:07:21.810
And this is like dishes will be a plating.
Like for example,

1030
01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:26.710
Tobo like a little something Crostini Kumar die,
a little devil eggs,

1031
01:07:26.711 --> 01:07:28.180
a little suites.
So on.

1032
01:07:28.181 --> 01:07:32.400
This is the actually move with what we received from Vermont yesterday and he's

1033
01:07:32.401 --> 01:07:36.810
like carving it right now.
And these are the filets you can see it's very,

1034
01:07:36.811 --> 01:07:38.370
very dark meat.
It's beautiful.

1035
01:07:38.371 --> 01:07:42.390
Very red meat is a little beautiful little garlic obviously for the beautiful

1036
01:07:42.391 --> 01:07:45.840
breath.
Cause I know you love,
I love your love,
your love garlic breath.

1037
01:07:45.930 --> 01:07:48.160
I love garlic breath.
If I'm going to give a kiss to Christina,

1038
01:07:48.170 --> 01:07:53.070
they all of the different ingredients obviously as well from

1039
01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:59.510
you're putting it into,
into a little.
So this guy's a stud shaft though.

1040
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:02.310
He's a master degree on chef as well from German.

1041
01:08:02.311 --> 01:08:04.920
He comes from a three star Michelin restaurant in Germany,

1042
01:08:04.921 --> 01:08:08.610
the hotel at Harbor Toowoomba.
And uh,
he really knows his shit.

1043
01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:12.630
So he's putting some fire on it as well to get some roster Romas to the Moose.

1044
01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:16.760
Yeah,
and he had a lot of fun well to it.
So obviously he wouldn't end.

1045
01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:19.160
This is not a thumb right there.
You're the white thing.

1046
01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:21.650
They are like different herbs in it and we don't want that.

1047
01:08:21.651 --> 01:08:23.240
The reps are touching actually the food.

1048
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:26.690
We just want the aromas of the reps really putting it into this small little

1049
01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:30.470
smarter little back and then we're putting it back out later on and then it's

1050
01:08:30.471 --> 01:08:34.610
getting reducted a little bit of,
I'm blown away.
I'm like,
here we go.

1051
01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:36.890
And this is like how the finished product looks like.

1052
01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:42.620
I'm blown away.
Here we go.
Let's see what the chef,
yeah,

1053
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.880
he did a leg senses like sense good.
So I haven't tasted it yet.

1054
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:50.240
He just tasted it.
But I'm very excited for you and you're so try it out.

1055
01:08:50.241 --> 01:08:54.650
I got my back,
I spent at home.
So this will be a lot of fun for you on dude.

1056
01:08:54.651 --> 01:08:57.560
It is on.
Ah,
that's so nice of you.

1057
01:08:57.590 --> 01:09:00.860
Thank you Troy thing because everybody was talking about moose soup and I was

1058
01:09:00.861 --> 01:09:03.230
like,
okay,
Moosup most of,
most of,
I never heard about this.

1059
01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:06.650
And then I was finding out a little bit and then I had talked to Andrea,
my chef,

1060
01:09:06.651 --> 01:09:08.990
and he's like,
Hey,
let's cook someone sit with make it,

1061
01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:12.730
and we did this yesterday and we had a lot of fun shoot with that.
That is so he,

1062
01:09:12.731 --> 01:09:15.080
he enjoyed it as well.
That's a,
yeah,

1063
01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:20.050
that says as cool a thing is I've heard somebody doing,
thank you.
Gee.

1064
01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:24.440
Yeah,
that's,
we're going to,
we're going to do it.

1065
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:27.480
She should come down as well.
She should,
yeah.
Yeah.

1066
01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:32.760
I wonder what she would think of a Michelin Stars version of a moose moose soup

1067
01:09:33.021 --> 01:09:36.880
because that's often all this as well because I saw pictures and they all ready

1068
01:09:36.890 --> 01:09:41.150
looked like a poof of apes or something like this.
It's like apes.

1069
01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:44.540
If facts there are some disgusting moves,
her pictures online.

1070
01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:48.020
I have to say that it's like really some pictures smelled like literally like

1071
01:09:48.021 --> 01:09:50.240
okay when you were really,
really sick and you're going to the,

1072
01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:53.960
you're going to the restroom and you already know there are some problems with

1073
01:09:53.961 --> 01:09:58.430
your stomach and your,
you're looking afterwards what happened in,

1074
01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:02.300
in the,
in the toilet.
And this is like sometimes what Moosup looks like.

1075
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:05.990
Oh my God.
Cause you don't want to know is really nice.
Uh,

1076
01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:10.100
are these photos to be looked at as well or is it because like I was here in

1077
01:10:10.101 --> 01:10:13.700
March or April this year and there's so many things happened.
I wasn't,

1078
01:10:13.701 --> 01:10:15.470
China did a big water tasting.

1079
01:10:15.471 --> 01:10:19.940
They're over a hundred different waters and I will be coming up on Netflix for

1080
01:10:19.941 --> 01:10:23.840
the bill Nye show.
Oh that's great.
So the science,
the science guy,

1081
01:10:23.841 --> 01:10:28.700
I had a lot of fun with a sky and he invited me to do a water tasting and he

1082
01:10:28.701 --> 01:10:31.070
gave me three different waters.
The first water was la tap.

1083
01:10:31.670 --> 01:10:33.590
The second bottle was double distilled water.

1084
01:10:33.591 --> 01:10:36.440
What I refuse to drink because I said like,
what the fuck?

1085
01:10:36.441 --> 01:10:39.020
Why should I drink double distilled water?
There's real benefits for me.

1086
01:10:39.021 --> 01:10:40.910
So forget it,
I'm not drinking this.

1087
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:43.720
And the third ward and what we're seeing right now,
they're explosive.

1088
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:47.540
Serration life support water.
This is actually out of space.

1089
01:10:47.541 --> 01:10:50.780
Water from the international space ship.

1090
01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:54.500
This is their recycled water.
What they are drinking.
So it's astronaut water.

1091
01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:59.510
This is what they're drinking.
They're drinking on the spaceship.
I also in space,

1092
01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:02.900
in space,
they have to re they recycle their water.
Yes.

1093
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:05.870
So this was the most unique water I ever tasted in my life.

1094
01:11:05.871 --> 01:11:10.430
So it's water recovery and management from the NASA Marshall Space Flight
Center.

1095
01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:13.800
And when you go on to the next page or next photo,

1096
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:15.810
you will see what that actually is.

1097
01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:21.080
So it's recycled water made from waste products extracted by them.

1098
01:11:21.431 --> 01:11:25.080
Ploys of summer 2015 actually it's out of this world.
Yeah,

1099
01:11:25.081 --> 01:11:28.710
it was out of this world because this is nothing other then sweat shower,

1100
01:11:28.711 --> 01:11:33.711
water distilled Urien conization and then they're adding some slower to make it

1101
01:11:33.841 --> 01:11:35.100
hard for a fight and clean.

1102
01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:38.850
Why waste products x greeted by the employees.

1103
01:11:38.851 --> 01:11:42.510
So I was drinking that I or even revisit that water.

1104
01:11:42.570 --> 01:11:44.690
So I drink a twice and they all looked at me.

1105
01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:47.700
There was one comedian right next to me.
He was like,
what the fuck?
Like you're,

1106
01:11:47.701 --> 01:11:48.510
you're,

1107
01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:51.780
you're refusing to ring double distilled water but you're drinking that shit.

1108
01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:54.720
And I was like,
yeah,
I want to taste that.

1109
01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:00.930
It has extremely heavy smell first.
So when you smelling like glass,
it's smart.

1110
01:12:00.931 --> 01:12:02.610
Like when you're walking into a dentist office,

1111
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:06.700
this chemical very like we smell.
Yeah.

1112
01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:10.920
It was very sweet and taste cause silver at sweetness to your water.

1113
01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:15.370
Ed was not yummy.
Let's face this.
A slug of water was drawn the time.

1114
01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:21.540
It's not really,
you can,
you can taste like this whole chemical aspect to it.

1115
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:26.990
It's like Allie tap times five in this chlorine and silver and camera,

1116
01:12:27.661 --> 01:12:30.990
you can really smell and drink hemlock cuts.
It's not really enjoyable.

1117
01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:35.700
Is there a rated,
I mean were they able to find out the mineral content?

1118
01:12:36.210 --> 01:12:38.470
Nope.
Nope.
And it's highly distilled as well.

1119
01:12:38.471 --> 01:12:41.070
So obviously the middle of conduct has to be extremely low.

1120
01:12:41.130 --> 01:12:44.700
Extremely low because otherwise if it wasn't stripped it would be like getting

1121
01:12:44.701 --> 01:12:49.230
people sick.
So the fun part about this water is that obviously the ISS,

1122
01:12:49.231 --> 01:12:52.050
the international space ship has two divisions.

1123
01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.970
It's a Russian division and an American division.

1124
01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:58.410
The Russians recycling the water as well,
but they don't use the own urine.

1125
01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:00.570
They're like Nana,
that's too nasty force.

1126
01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:05.010
So the Americans even collecting the ruin of the Russians and user.
Yes.

1127
01:13:05.011 --> 01:13:10.000
And using that as well
because hey it's so expensive.
Rooskie p yes.

1128
01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:14.130
So,
oh boy.
So they told me this interesting,

1129
01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:17.020
interesting story about that,
that really whack.

1130
01:13:17.021 --> 01:13:22.021
So you will see me on Netflix episode four on the second season that's coming

1131
01:13:22.651 --> 01:13:26.130
up,
hopefully in end of November on the table.
I love this,

1132
01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:27.450
but it was a lot of fun.
Next one,

1133
01:13:27.451 --> 01:13:31.320
can I go next page is a sure thing or there's like a picture of Bill Nye and

1134
01:13:31.321 --> 01:13:34.460
then with me,
and this is like the three waters up there.

1135
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:37.440
And the producer came up to me and because they want to do a blind taste first

1136
01:13:37.441 --> 01:13:38.040
with me.

1137
01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:40.800
So they put all the three waters and I was just smelling them and I could tell

1138
01:13:40.801 --> 01:13:42.510
them right away which waters what really?

1139
01:13:42.610 --> 01:13:46.890
And they're like what are you the smell shit now you know I was like no you

1140
01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:50.640
can't smother difference at tab was just the pool from the backyard.

1141
01:13:50.970 --> 01:13:53.400
Then there's double distilled water,
had no smell at all.

1142
01:13:53.730 --> 01:13:58.730
And then this urine astronaut water was just like just Gus how smell disgusting.

1143
01:13:59.971 --> 01:14:00.940
And this is like on the shoulder.

1144
01:14:00.941 --> 01:14:05.430
It was like for my wife took the pictures from the audience and that's very
cool.

1145
01:14:05.431 --> 01:14:09.290
There will be a fun little really fun sequence but it's great man.
Olivia,

1146
01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:12.970
good one.
Okay,
so the next picture,
and this is a water what I brought,

1147
01:14:12.971 --> 01:14:16.870
it's called civil body from Norway.
And this pic,

1148
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:20.650
the bottle already is kind of stunning cause I will on an open display bottle.

1149
01:14:20.650 --> 01:14:21.850
Is it this one?

1150
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:26.910
Oh this is like what you buy high end liquor comes in a case like that.

1151
01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:31.660
It has the prize of a high end liquor.
It does.
So it runs $150 in the restaurant.

1152
01:14:31.670 --> 01:14:33.810
Yet he has a 50 bucks at Costco.

1153
01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:36.610
When you want to buy it's retail and hundred and 50 which charging at the

1154
01:14:36.611 --> 01:14:39.670
restaurant.
But we are selling it.
People are really addicted to it.

1155
01:14:40.030 --> 01:14:44.740
Really interesting.
So is this a flatwater?
Yes.

1156
01:14:44.770 --> 01:14:46.540
I brought the still waters today.

1157
01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:49.840
I thought today it is still November month.

1158
01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:54.100
We drink still water still water.
This is from Norway,
from Norway.

1159
01:14:54.130 --> 01:14:59.080
This comes from from the doctors.
So it's a polar iceberg water.

1160
01:14:59.650 --> 01:15:03.650
So the middle of content obviously is extremely loads.
21 tds.
Roy,

1161
01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:06.310
you're very alone because this water has never been touched on the ground.

1162
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:08.440
It's like rain border drip stone.

1163
01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:11.020
It goes right away on the ice glacier and freezes up.

1164
01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:15.610
This water's the one 15,000 years old.
What's in the bottle right here?

1165
01:15:16.330 --> 01:15:20.800
And uh,
I see the picture right here.
So the harvesting these icebergs and all,

1166
01:15:20.801 --> 01:15:22.960
some people would say like,
are you not smart?
And so yo yo,

1167
01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:25.450
we all know like global warming and everything.
You know,

1168
01:15:25.451 --> 01:15:28.060
you're like taking the icebox.
Even my way.
He said,
nope,

1169
01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:30.790
these are icebergs who breaking down like totally normal.

1170
01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:34.480
They're starting to dilute then into the North Sea and when they are diluted,

1171
01:15:34.481 --> 01:15:37.340
you cannot use that word anymore.
Then it's like heavily salted.
Yeah.

1172
01:15:37.390 --> 01:15:41.200
So they're picking up this huge icebergs and you can see it like they had tons,

1173
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:42.220
they're super heavy.

1174
01:15:42.221 --> 01:15:45.760
They have our own vessel that picking up these icebergs and then melting them

1175
01:15:45.761 --> 01:15:50.020
down into this bottle.
So it's something very cost intensive and cost intensive.

1176
01:15:50.021 --> 01:15:54.670
And also it's not going to be that they're not going to make million now.

1177
01:15:54.671 --> 01:15:56.740
And then I think they did 10,000 bottles,
plastics.

1178
01:15:56.741 --> 01:15:59.590
So that's why the price point is going to be elevated.
It's something very,

1179
01:15:59.591 --> 01:16:03.130
very unique.
Um,
that's fascinating.

1180
01:16:03.190 --> 01:16:04.690
So it's a very fun,

1181
01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:09.250
interesting water to start your sober November maybe.
Oh my goodness.

1182
01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:11.070
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1183
01:16:11.070 --> 01:16:15.940
<v 11>And it's going to be,
as you mentioned,
a pretty low.
Yeah,
yeah.</v>

1184
01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:20.110
But,
but it's still a distinct flavor or no,
that's interesting pot.

1185
01:16:20.111 --> 01:16:23.310
So I had three bottles already in tasting and all three bottles tasted slightly

1186
01:16:23.311 --> 01:16:27.030
different.
And that makes sense because it's a mother,
it's a product of nature.

1187
01:16:27.031 --> 01:16:30.670
Again.
And all these icebergs that are floating into the sea.

1188
01:16:30.671 --> 01:16:34.380
So obviously all these icebergs have as slightly different flavor to it.

1189
01:16:34.410 --> 01:16:37.110
And the name again is smell body,
small bodies,

1190
01:16:37.111 --> 01:16:40.200
the region and Norway and they calling that water as well as from our body.

1191
01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:42.960
So let's see what this version tastes like.
[inaudible]

1192
01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:48.313
<v 6>okay.</v>

1193
01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:54.910
<v 11>To me it's very smooth.
Very,
very smooth.
I think so too.
It's very smooth.</v>

1194
01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:00.100
But it has,
when you drink it and it's,
it's right away gone.

1195
01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:03.460
Yes.
Like it's almost dries out Japan.
It I think,
yeah,

1196
01:17:03.670 --> 01:17:07.120
it doesn't really have this refreshing aspect to it.
That's interesting.

1197
01:17:07.121 --> 01:17:10.880
And that is because it's lacking minerals because it's lacking.
Yes.
The cord.

1198
01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:15.140
That's not enough minerals.
And there are so your body on your mouth saying like,

1199
01:17:15.141 --> 01:17:17.400
Hey,
what's going on?
Can I get some more?
Can I get some more of a,

1200
01:17:17.401 --> 01:17:18.740
cause that's like barely anything in there.

1201
01:17:18.741 --> 01:17:22.010
So I want more water to get more minerals.
Interesting.

1202
01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:28.460
Let's hit good water.
I like it.
It's extremely,
because it's so smooth.

1203
01:17:28.461 --> 01:17:29.690
It's very nice for wines.

1204
01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:33.190
So when you have like a 10 and rich red wine or something like that or maybe a

1205
01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:37.040
risky,
what'd you just told me?
Um,
that will very,

1206
01:17:37.041 --> 01:17:41.810
very cool walk with us because this,
this heaviness of alcohol will be some,

1207
01:17:41.811 --> 01:17:44.000
most of the way of this very smooth water.
So it's a,

1208
01:17:44.001 --> 01:17:47.120
it's a very good water and I don't want to drink everything because I think your

1209
01:17:47.121 --> 01:17:50.570
wife,
Christina need to drink something.
A swell and Chub will kill both of us.

1210
01:17:50.571 --> 01:17:52.580
I think when we probably,

1211
01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:55.190
when we killing the bottles here just for us and we don't,

1212
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:57.050
we don't share that I'm be mean,

1213
01:17:57.051 --> 01:18:02.051
but I have to say that is a very pleasurable tasting.

1214
01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:06.050
In other words,
uh,
it's,
it's enjoyable.
I think so too.
It's not,

1215
01:18:06.051 --> 01:18:10.910
it's something that you go like,
oh,
okay.
I mean the satisfying sip of water.
Oh,

1216
01:18:10.911 --> 01:18:13.280
absolutely.
It wouldn't satisfy my pocket,

1217
01:18:13.281 --> 01:18:17.150
I have to say because it's produced popcorn one 50 in a restaurant.

1218
01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:19.550
But so somebody could go out and buy it though.

1219
01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:22.020
Where would you buy stuff like that?
Oh,
you can buy it.

1220
01:18:22.021 --> 01:18:23.960
Because a lot of people ask me as well like,
Hey Martin,

1221
01:18:23.961 --> 01:18:26.690
where can you buy all this crazy waters?
What you had last time on the show.

1222
01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:29.360
And we said it's actually my Ester in Florida.

1223
01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:32.800
So these are the people who can actually,
or they importing most of the,

1224
01:18:32.801 --> 01:18:34.790
of their very unique waters in this country.

1225
01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:37.850
So you can call up Brett is his name?

1226
01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:42.890
Acoma yesto and can you say that slower?
[inaudible] my yes.
Tro.

1227
01:18:43.130 --> 01:18:47.810
Oh,
okay.
Yup.
Okay.
So,
and he even like Aqua Maestro.

1228
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:51.170
Yes.
Here we go.
Okay.
Like my German accent might know.
I know I sent again,

1229
01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:52.950
believe me,
I just wanted to debate,
you know,

1230
01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:55.580
I wanted to make sure everything cool.
So Aqua Maestro,

1231
01:18:55.940 --> 01:19:00.940
maestro in Florida and flew Google Lauderdale for Lauderdale and then you will

1232
01:19:01.461 --> 01:19:04.460
find them right away last time.
And I will talk to a bread again.

1233
01:19:04.461 --> 01:19:08.030
Last time they gave actually a 10% off for everybody who mentioned your mom's

1234
01:19:08.031 --> 01:19:12.960
house podcast.
Yes.
So we call that so many inquiries suddenly for skilled.
Okay.

1235
01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:16.220
So that was kind of cool.
And I think this is a nice thing.
And for sure bread,

1236
01:19:16.221 --> 01:19:18.170
we'll do this again when you call them up and say,
Hey,

1237
01:19:18.171 --> 01:19:21.080
I listened to your mom sells podcast and as far yeah,

1238
01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:24.890
for sure he will do something again.
Okay.
He's a nice guy.
Um,
yeah,

1239
01:19:24.891 --> 01:19:27.350
that was like still hydrate.
Very interesting.
Um,

1240
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:31.310
can I switch to the next one here?
That's fish our next next picture already.

1241
01:19:31.311 --> 01:19:35.480
And you can see the vessel fucking nuts where there's ice books are collecting.

1242
01:19:35.481 --> 01:19:38.570
So this ship goes out,

1243
01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:41.990
picks up like scoops up almost like a fisherman.

1244
01:19:42.330 --> 01:19:47.330
We picked correct shrimp and just has a boat full of iceberg.

1245
01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:51.770
And then they take that back to some factory and correct.
Correct.

1246
01:19:51.771 --> 01:19:54.260
And then they are diluting it.
This water obviously into the bottle.

1247
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:59.690
So it really has never touched anything.
Nope.
Trust icebergs and the glass.

1248
01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:03.950
That's wild man.
And then our mouth.
Now that's,
that is why it's a fun product.

1249
01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:04.943
Yeah.
Like this.

1250
01:20:04.970 --> 01:20:08.820
And they won because I told you I was dressed Russ and easily in swat.

1251
01:20:08.821 --> 01:20:13.740
Serval bars,
availability.
[inaudible] I spoke water and they just won the,

1252
01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:14.790
uh,

1253
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:18.900
in China was a big water competition and they will show us like the silver metal

1254
01:20:18.901 --> 01:20:23.860
for taste.
And then they won the gold medal for the,
uh,
the product in general.
Oh,

1255
01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:27.030
the presentation.
The presentation is awesome.
Yeah.
That's outstanding.
Yeah,

1256
01:20:27.150 --> 01:20:28.050
I think so too.
And that's,

1257
01:20:28.051 --> 01:20:30.300
I have to say that's like a lot of people at my restaurant,

1258
01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:33.330
they're obviously going into water main and they see this beautiful bottle in

1259
01:20:33.331 --> 01:20:37.350
the sea.
Like do the watch page.
I want to drop 150 bucks for a water.
Yeah.

1260
01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:40.960
Why not?
Why not experience some people driving a Lamborghini?
Yeah.

1261
01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:44.070
A tool to the gym or to a hot yoga and some people are drinking water.

1262
01:20:45.670 --> 01:20:50.340
How are we rolling now these days?
So,
uh,
what's,

1263
01:20:50.341 --> 01:20:54.030
um,
what's this next one?
So the next one,

1264
01:20:54.150 --> 01:20:58.680
I was very surprised when I heard about this,
that Chuck Norris has a water.

1265
01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:01.830
Come on.
This is the official Chuck Norris.

1266
01:21:01.831 --> 01:21:06.831
Walter see from Texas from his privately owned ranch.

1267
01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:11.790
Really?
Yes.
He has a water and I see this bottle.
Yes.

1268
01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:15.290
I reached out to them and there were so happy to give me some products and said

1269
01:21:15.291 --> 01:21:16.770
like,
hey,
that's so cool what you're doing.

1270
01:21:17.010 --> 01:21:22.010
So I did already a video on youtube about the taste profile of see fours and I

1271
01:21:22.441 --> 01:21:24.750
thought it would be a fun thing to bring it here to the show.

1272
01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:27.370
Now today it's a very loud cause.
I'm a big chuck Norris Fan.

1273
01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:29.070
I have to admit this.
I think he's,

1274
01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:33.390
he's cool and crazy and so I went to the homepage as well and they're saying,

1275
01:21:33.391 --> 01:21:36.180
so chuck Norris heard that you guys are thirsty.

1276
01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:40.770
So he punched the grounds and mate the earth cry.
Yes.

1277
01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:45.780
Therefore we get some water now.
So it's mother's birth tears.
Hey Man,

1278
01:21:45.810 --> 01:21:47.370
I mean I'm willing to give them a shot.

1279
01:21:47.371 --> 01:21:52.110
Chuck Norris can try anything that isn't a tease spring water and I love this

1280
01:21:52.111 --> 01:21:54.480
and they're very proud about this.
They're saying,
no,

1281
01:21:54.481 --> 01:21:56.940
we are not performing anything.
We want minerals.

1282
01:21:56.941 --> 01:22:00.960
TDS is around 300 on this water.
So okay,
that's,

1283
01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:04.800
so that's actually a pretty,
pretty good stable of mineral.
That's some mineral.

1284
01:22:04.801 --> 01:22:08.670
Yeah.
Yes.
By U s law.

1285
01:22:08.671 --> 01:22:11.210
This is actually mineral water considered everything.

1286
01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:15.200
250 a tds means it's a mineral water.
Okay.

1287
01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:19.500
So this is considered to be a mineral spring water from Texas.

1288
01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:24.240
See Force.
Hmm.
Let's see.
Let's give it a shot.

1289
01:22:24.241 --> 01:22:25.074
She has cheers.

1290
01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:31.253
<v 6>Hmm.</v>

1291
01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:38.500
<v 11>It definitely tastes different.
Oh yeah.
Uh,
from the,
from the small body.
Yeah,</v>

1292
01:22:38.830 --> 01:22:41.680
I think so too.
I'd have it.
A little sweetness to it,
I think.

1293
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.903
<v 6>Hmm.</v>

1294
01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:51.640
<v 11>I'm not,
I dunno,
I'm not that into it.</v>

1295
01:22:55.250 --> 01:22:56.083
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1296
01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:58.940
<v 11>You're not into Chuck Norris.
I mean,</v>

1297
01:23:02.050 --> 01:23:04.050
I don't know what it is about it.
It's like,

1298
01:23:04.170 --> 01:23:09.170
it's almost like it's just under the tastes I'm supposed to be tasting or just

1299
01:23:12.370 --> 01:23:15.700
over something that is supposed to be masking.
I Dunno.
It's like,
it's like,

1300
01:23:15.701 --> 01:23:19.090
it's very,
so it feel maybe because the name Chuck Norris on it,

1301
01:23:19.091 --> 01:23:22.690
you feel something powerful maybe at Vichy or Roy or something like this.

1302
01:23:22.691 --> 01:23:24.850
That's something outrageous and taste.

1303
01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:27.990
We had thought I just had different expectations.
Maybe that's it.
And this is,

1304
01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:31.010
might be what it is.
A swat call.
The tds.
That's 300 again.
Yeah.

1305
01:23:31.190 --> 01:23:32.620
I think it's a good product.
Obviously.

1306
01:23:32.621 --> 01:23:36.970
It's not so unique than maybe this fall bodies story or the skill of what we had

1307
01:23:36.971 --> 01:23:39.410
last time.
We had change changes in Tamila.

1308
01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:43.270
When you're shaking the bottle it doesn't have something so extremely unique.

1309
01:23:43.271 --> 01:23:48.130
Obviously also you know what it is also is that I think I mean without being as

1310
01:23:48.131 --> 01:23:51.970
familiar with waters as you are when you said 300 and that this would be

1311
01:23:51.971 --> 01:23:54.460
considered mineral water.
I think my brain was also like,

1312
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:59.550
oh now it's going to have a taste to it and then it tastes like very subdued.

1313
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:03.580
Okay.
So that makes sense.
I just didn't taste,
I don't really taste much with it.

1314
01:24:03.610 --> 01:24:07.480
Yup.
Yup.
But it was for me,

1315
01:24:07.481 --> 01:24:11.050
interesting to see that Chuck Norris has that's very involved and I want it to a

1316
01:24:11.051 --> 01:24:13.170
test that out and it was for me.
Interesting.

1317
01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:17.650
Imagine trying to get into the water game,
like trying to get into bottled water.

1318
01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:22.210
Seems like maybe you should create a your mum's house.
Yeah.

1319
01:24:22.330 --> 01:24:27.330
I mean like yeah that market before real easy mommies for all the people who

1320
01:24:28.031 --> 01:24:31.900
Wang the jeans,
what would be our game plan?

1321
01:24:31.930 --> 01:24:36.180
I mean what sorts are we going to tap?
Um,
oh,
I have a lot of connection that,

1322
01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:39.670
that is actually easy for me.
Okay.
The marketing though,
right?

1323
01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:44.350
Because I have a Brenda spots called Beverly hills nine h toe.
Oh,
that's right.

1324
01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:49.020
So,
and it was last week on the Jimmy Fallon show.
That's very okay.

1325
01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:51.980
Jimmy Fallon taste and you can see it on youtube right now.
Uh,

1326
01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:55.240
two Chainz taste it with Jimmy Fallon,

1327
01:24:55.241 --> 01:25:00.160
nine age tool on the show and,
and it was a blind taste test.
New York tap,

1328
01:25:00.190 --> 01:25:01.490
the famous New York tap.

1329
01:25:01.491 --> 01:25:06.491
What's considered to be one of the best tap waters in the states versus nine or

1330
01:25:06.811 --> 01:25:11.560
h two o.
And it's a very funny video.
It is.
Oh my God.

1331
01:25:11.890 --> 01:25:12.880
So Jimmy Fallon,

1332
01:25:12.881 --> 01:25:17.380
it's like looking at this two glasses and tasting the first class and realized,

1333
01:25:17.530 --> 01:25:22.270
Holy Shit,
that tastes so bad.
This has to be tapped.
And in Boston,
New York Tech.

1334
01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:25.490
And he's like,
and he felt almost like embarrassed and he said like,

1335
01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:28.450
I love the city.
I am been grown up here in New York,

1336
01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:31.690
but this is outrageous.
Like that.

1337
01:25:31.691 --> 01:25:36.520
Water is just no way I'm going to turn to drink this really [inaudible] yard.

1338
01:25:36.521 --> 01:25:40.180
I'm doing Chad item,
drink,
tap.
That's not my style.
That's not how I roll.

1339
01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:41.373
I don't drink tap.

1340
01:25:41.770 --> 01:25:45.790
And then they tasted nine h two o and Jimmy Fallon into the camera.
Like,
oh,

1341
01:25:45.791 --> 01:25:49.870
la La.
This is expensive shit.
Oh,
so then what's good and what's that funny.

1342
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:53.170
Very funny of your water's available everywhere.
Yeah.

1343
01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:57.430
Not really everywhere right now because it's a very small production of water as

1344
01:25:57.431 --> 01:26:00.510
well and bevel it's nine which was actually sold outright.
Now judge,

1345
01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:03.410
after the Jimmy Fallon show,
obviously we sold out right away.

1346
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:05.030
You got to be thrilled with it.
It's crazy.

1347
01:26:05.031 --> 01:26:07.160
It was great about we need to produce now again.

1348
01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:10.130
So it's very tricky and it's not that easy.
A lot of people always think,
oh,

1349
01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:14.270
they just open a tap and they're filling that this,
no,
no,
because I'm a maniac.

1350
01:26:14.271 --> 01:26:14.811
I'm German.

1351
01:26:14.811 --> 01:26:18.410
I want to be like crazy and I want to be a control freak when it comes to us.

1352
01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:20.930
I want to make sure this water is perfect.
Yeah.

1353
01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:25.640
So we're sourcing that water from the San Diego Mountains and I'm very calm.

1354
01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:29.810
I'm very strict about where are the sources coming from,
which plastic,

1355
01:26:29.811 --> 01:26:32.870
which p t you are using because I don't want to have any BPA,

1356
01:26:32.871 --> 01:26:36.260
any chemicals in there.
It's a beautiful blue bottle.
The bottle,

1357
01:26:36.261 --> 01:26:39.350
what we showcase on the Jimmy Fallon show,
it's a glass bottle as well.

1358
01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:41.890
I'm very strict about the glass as well.
Um,

1359
01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:44.150
I'm like a control freak when it comes to this.
For me,

1360
01:26:44.151 --> 01:26:49.151
quality is the non plus ultra and I don't want to just give some water on the

1361
01:26:50.211 --> 01:26:53.840
mass market and to just make a fast buck.
That's not me.
Yeah,

1362
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:56.000
they are for right now,
nine,
eight shows sold out,

1363
01:26:56.001 --> 01:27:00.950
but it will definitely come back when better when I feel the quality is perfect

1364
01:27:01.190 --> 01:27:03.710
and then I'll release the next batch.
Great.
That's awesome.

1365
01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:06.350
I want to get a batch of that.
That wasn't plot.
I'll bring it next time.

1366
01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:11.680
I'll bring it next time.
Um,
you have one more.
One more.

1367
01:27:11.710 --> 01:27:15.950
We're going to Australia actually life and this bottle and you can see it

1368
01:27:15.951 --> 01:27:16.670
already on the label.

1369
01:27:16.670 --> 01:27:21.260
It's a little beaten up or they sent me a whole case of water and actually just

1370
01:27:21.261 --> 01:27:24.050
three bottles survived.
The rest was broken.
Wow.

1371
01:27:24.110 --> 01:27:27.330
So it's all the time I have this and obviously my landlord at my apartment,
oh,

1372
01:27:27.331 --> 01:27:28.940
I see.
Like what the hell is,
is always,

1373
01:27:28.941 --> 01:27:33.020
why are you getting all this speed up packages from all around the world can

1374
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:34.070
these days.
And this is the fun,

1375
01:27:34.071 --> 01:27:38.270
cool thing about me as a water [inaudible] that literary people from around the

1376
01:27:38.271 --> 01:27:40.580
world sending me Walter Snow all the time.
You got to love that.

1377
01:27:40.670 --> 01:27:44.120
It's really fascinating.
It's also your passion.
Oh yeah.

1378
01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:47.240
It's completely fascinating to taste all the different mineral waters from

1379
01:27:47.241 --> 01:27:48.074
around the world.

1380
01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:53.200
So aqui life has a tds of 1,300 so this is considered a very high middle of the

1381
01:27:54.781 --> 01:27:56.540
water.
This is a still version,

1382
01:27:56.810 --> 01:28:00.860
and this is for me fascinating because mostly high mineral waters are sparkling

1383
01:28:00.861 --> 01:28:04.330
waters,
but this is our sparkling,

1384
01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:07.580
just cause it's more palatable for minerals or no,
I don't want to say this,

1385
01:28:07.581 --> 01:28:12.310
but a lot of high mineral content,
water's coming with CO2 out of the grounds.
Oh,

1386
01:28:12.311 --> 01:28:14.650
okay.
So they already,
they auction national.
Let's see.

1387
01:28:14.651 --> 01:28:18.560
Youtube and our coffee life is,

1388
01:28:18.710 --> 01:28:22.340
it's still water from Australia.
You've tried this?
Yes.
Yeah.
I tried this already.

1389
01:28:22.770 --> 01:28:26.990
This act,
this water.
Um,
a thousand,
2000,
300.

1390
01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:31.460
This is definitely going to have a flavor.
Yeah,
it has to.
It has a texture,

1391
01:28:32.430 --> 01:28:33.980
has a texture.
It has a texture.

1392
01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:35.973
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1393
01:28:41.850 --> 01:28:45.360
<v 11>Oh yeah.
This is heavy water.
Yeah.
This is familiar with the heavy,</v>

1394
01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:49.320
see I never x and this will be fascinating and this is like what I love when a

1395
01:28:49.321 --> 01:28:50.160
tasting waters,

1396
01:28:50.670 --> 01:28:54.930
this is so unique and textures almost if you're drinking like high percentage

1397
01:28:54.931 --> 01:28:57.260
milk or oil or foil.
This is like the,

1398
01:28:57.261 --> 01:29:02.261
the mouthfeel you know it's funny because everyone's brain sends different

1399
01:29:02.311 --> 01:29:03.144
thoughts.

1400
01:29:03.390 --> 01:29:07.680
I'm anticipating like my moment before was like,

1401
01:29:07.710 --> 01:29:11.070
oh this is going to be salty.
Like that was my,
my thought.

1402
01:29:11.790 --> 01:29:16.020
It's like oil but like,
like smooth like mineral oil.
Like a,

1403
01:29:16.830 --> 01:29:19.560
it's almost like an olive oil.
It was something you could drink.
Right.

1404
01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:22.410
That's like a richness to it.
When you would close your eyes,

1405
01:29:22.411 --> 01:29:25.500
you would think you would drink olive oil soluble drink milk or something like

1406
01:29:25.501 --> 01:29:26.790
that.
She would not think of it.

1407
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:30.420
This is Walter because it's so heavy and your Palette,

1408
01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:33.930
and this is for me fascinating.
That's the reason I'm trying to get them.

1409
01:29:33.970 --> 01:29:36.180
They won't have distribution right now in the states.

1410
01:29:36.490 --> 01:29:38.410
I'm trying to get them on my new water menu,

1411
01:29:38.430 --> 01:29:42.780
whatever lounge at Patina next month because I think it's something so unique.

1412
01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:45.330
I want to showcase that that is of water for me.
Again,

1413
01:29:45.331 --> 01:29:48.570
like what my brain is like,
holy cow,

1414
01:29:48.610 --> 01:29:52.320
this is so cool that mother nature gives me something so crazy.

1415
01:29:52.321 --> 01:29:56.700
And any of the three for me by far the most unique tastes.
Oh yeah,
definitely.
Um,

1416
01:29:56.730 --> 01:29:59.170
and the first ones by far the most unique story.
Yeah.

1417
01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:02.460
And and also very satisfying.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1418
01:30:02.530 --> 01:30:05.790
But I think it's an interesting exercise again to see three Stillwater's this

1419
01:30:05.791 --> 01:30:09.840
time.
Last time I brought yes and mix and match was amazing and I wanted to,

1420
01:30:09.841 --> 01:30:14.520
wanted to showcase even Stillwater case differently and has a different texture

1421
01:30:14.521 --> 01:30:19.470
and,
and can taste completely different.
This is so cool.
Um,
yeah man,

1422
01:30:19.471 --> 01:30:22.050
I'm fascinating.
And so again,
if you want to try people,

1423
01:30:22.051 --> 01:30:24.420
cause we got hit up like to,
you know,

1424
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:29.470
then people wanted me to keep posting about the waters and Aqua Maestro.

1425
01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:32.730
Yes.
In Florida.
Um,

1426
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:37.800
bookmark that you should,
if you are a Foodie,
if you love restaurants,

1427
01:30:37.801 --> 01:30:38.850
you come in Los Angeles,

1428
01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:43.480
go to Patina and you could even possibly meet Martin and,

1429
01:30:43.481 --> 01:30:48.030
and try some more.
Trying to be there on a daily basis.
I will try my best.

1430
01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:48.740
Um,

1431
01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:53.740
and then put a reminder in your phone to get Beverly Hills nights til nine o h

1432
01:30:55.801 --> 01:31:00.030
two o um,
when it comes back on the market and watched Bill Nye,

1433
01:31:00.150 --> 01:31:02.850
this will be a fun one.
Yeah,
that's a really good one.

1434
01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:05.670
And don't you have your own site as well or they show Martin Slash [inaudible]

1435
01:31:05.671 --> 01:31:09.300
dot com obviously my own homepage.
Facebook.
Instagram is always much a reason,

1436
01:31:09.301 --> 01:31:11.220
so it's easy to find me I think.
And Yeah,

1437
01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:14.280
we will definitely do a post again of the three waters,
what be tasted.

1438
01:31:14.281 --> 01:31:16.120
We will share this and our Instagram accounts.
Yes.

1439
01:31:16.590 --> 01:31:20.490
And I had one more question because you talked about the Lambo Jeannie Prank.

1440
01:31:20.610 --> 01:31:22.860
Yeah,
it was so fun.
So fun and fascinating.

1441
01:31:22.861 --> 01:31:26.820
I was laughing my ass off and my wife walk even up because I was watching that

1442
01:31:26.821 --> 01:31:30.300
abuse with my bat in the middle of the night and she was sleeping already.

1443
01:31:30.301 --> 01:31:31.470
And she's like,
what the hell is this?

1444
01:31:31.471 --> 01:31:33.030
An earthquake or wise are shaking the baton.

1445
01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:36.060
I was laughing that hard when you're,
when you're,

1446
01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:38.280
it was so good when you say like,

1447
01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:43.830
Holy Shit and you made this voice impression of of burden was brilliant.

1448
01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:46.950
Oh yeah.
But you were talking about the bottled water,
what you had for them.

1449
01:31:47.490 --> 01:31:49.380
And I was like the whole time guessing.

1450
01:31:49.870 --> 01:31:54.870
So when you see telling me which bottled water at it was a,

1451
01:31:55.490 --> 01:32:00.070
is interested in that you asked,
it was more of a uh,
oh,

1452
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:03.910
<v 4>was it a container?
Yes,
he'll be good.
I thought so that's what it was.</v>

1453
01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:08.420
So a guy,
I posted it on our,
um,

1454
01:32:09.630 --> 01:32:11.020
on our,
uh,

1455
01:32:11.230 --> 01:32:16.230
Instagram once sent us a case of these different,

1456
01:32:16.930 --> 01:32:19.540
I think it's called mere oh,
cool.
Uh,

1457
01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:24.190
like water bottles and containers,
like you say,
I am.

1458
01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:25.420
So that was the thing.

1459
01:32:25.450 --> 01:32:30.450
And so he sent these to their vacuum insulated and it keeps whatever temperature

1460
01:32:30.701 --> 01:32:34.660
you put it in there at stays like that for like 35.
That's awesome.

1461
01:32:34.990 --> 01:32:38.230
So they were really cool.
Um,
I thanked him online.
I forget his name,

1462
01:32:38.231 --> 01:32:41.620
but I thanked him on any Instagram.
Yeah.
But it wasn't actually a bottle of wine.

1463
01:32:41.621 --> 01:32:46.240
It wasn't contained cause I was like ego obviously.
Of course.
I was like,
okay,

1464
01:32:46.241 --> 01:32:49.100
which water home?
Which water has he and his Lamborghini now.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1465
01:32:49.101 --> 01:32:51.460
And I was looking the whole time and listening the whole time.
You think,

1466
01:32:51.461 --> 01:32:53.410
did I miss it?
Now?
What's going on here?
I want this.

1467
01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:57.610
I want to know which water you've been in.
My Lambo.
It's going to be nothing,

1468
01:32:57.611 --> 01:33:02.190
but it's followed by the deans.
Smile about uni,
small body.

1469
01:33:02.630 --> 01:33:06.910
So our body,
that language is,
um,
I dunno.
Yeah.

1470
01:33:06.911 --> 01:33:08.970
It's a tough language.
All the Scandinavian languages,

1471
01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:11.570
almost like you have a hot potato in your mouth and you're trying to talk to
you.

1472
01:33:11.571 --> 01:33:15.270
Yeah.
That's like what?
What the Danish and Norwegian,
yeah,

1473
01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:18.990
Finnish language and you see it written and I'm like,
well it's so intimidating.

1474
01:33:19.130 --> 01:33:23.080
Yeah,
you just want to drink it.
Dude.
Thank you so much for coming again.

1475
01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:26.770
This was so cool.
I love what you do.
Be here and let's do it again.

1476
01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:28.900
Anytime you want to do another tasting.

1477
01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:31.960
I haven't been bringing you always like some fun waters and I think we should.

1478
01:33:31.961 --> 01:33:34.930
We should do this.
Definitely the again and hopefully Christina,

1479
01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:37.870
I want me and mommy will be next time.
Yes,

1480
01:33:38.270 --> 01:33:40.900
Let me bring everybody out on this.

1481
01:33:40.901 --> 01:33:44.320
I got a little song to say goodbye and I'm,
that's it.

1482
01:33:44.350 --> 01:33:48.760
Thank you Martin again for joining us and we'll,
we'll have this up again soon.

1483
01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:53.250
Cheers guys.

A lot of no lie.</v>

1508

A lot.
I feel like it's not that bad.
I mean,

1509
01:35:59.510 --> 01:36:02.280
we can take some work.
It needs work,
but it's not bad.
