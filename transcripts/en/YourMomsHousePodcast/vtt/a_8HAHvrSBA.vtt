105
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.000
Tell me bones sticking out.
Pegging class.
What's pegging?
Pegging is pegging is

106
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.780
when a dude has sex with another dude.

107
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.070
I wasn't begging.

108
00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.110
<v 1>Don't bring in one loving to this.</v>

109
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.020
Well go to your mom's house,

110
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:09.983
Christina.

111
00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:38.693
No,

112
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:49.900
a

113
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:54.080
<v 3>little bit of the East street face.
He did that.
Yeah.
Yeah,</v>

114
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.980
Kevin.
He did what?

115
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:03.330
So Fun to talk shit about Springsteen on social media like post up cause he

116
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:06.320
have,
he has such a hardcore fans.

117
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.700
Basically if I write something about him or Donald Trump on social media,

118
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.940
there's always backlash,
which is really,
really amazing.

119
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:18.920
<v 5>Well Springsteen is like a rock God wrapped in a an American flag,
right?</v>

120
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.660
You cannot talk shit on the Boston.

121
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.870
They call him the boss and so serious that it's is.

122
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.370
<v 3>That's why it's fun to say that shit about them though.
I know he's not.</v>

123
00:09:28.371 --> 00:09:30.490
He's not that terrible is he?
Is He really needs that.

124
00:09:30.491 --> 00:09:32.960
I don't think he's the worst.
No,
it's not the worst.

125
00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:35.720
It's a fun game to play

126
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.660
here.
I just think it's funny to me,

127
00:09:41.661 --> 00:09:46.310
it's just funny how people worship him.
Worship.

128
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.600
That's really the part that's kind of,
if he was just like,
oh yeah guys,
great.

129
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:54.550
It would be different.
But when people are like
crazy,

130
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:59.690
so to be like that guy sucks and see people go like fuck
right.

131
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.640
People get really,
I did a post on Instagram.
We're at the rock hall of fame.

132
00:10:05.641 --> 00:10:05.761
Right.

133
00:10:05.761 --> 00:10:09.320
Just put thumbs down in front of a picture of him when I was there and I go,

134
00:10:09.321 --> 00:10:13.550
this guy sucks.
Oh my God.
I got a lot of heat.
A lot of blow back on that one.
Huh?

135
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:18.080
And then Trump you something shitty about Trump I did on Instagram,
man.

136
00:10:18.081 --> 00:10:19.190
It's just amazing.

137
00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.870
Like people really get fucking fired up about the dumbest guy we've ever had

138
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:25.160
involved in anything.

139
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.760
So burnt Chrysler,

140

143
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.300

We're like,
oh,

144
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.550
we could've talked about it right before it aired.

145
00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.980
Just stopped taping this show with Jon Sachs.

146
00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.590
So Nikki Glaser has got a new show on comedy central called not safe with Nikki

147
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.940
Glaser.

148
00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:05.940
She covers all these really taboo topics and she approached us as a couple to do

149
00:11:05.991 --> 00:11:10.390
the topic of pegging and begging class.
Yeah,

150
00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:15.710
it's Super Fun.
We'll put this on the website,
but just to give,

151
00:11:15.711 --> 00:11:17.330
I think what we shouldn't play the whole fucking thing.

152
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:20.390
It's on thousand ranch.com two oh,
it's up there now?
Yeah.
Okay,

153
00:11:20.391 --> 00:11:25.391
so this is just a little little touch intercourse where a woman inserts a strap

154
00:11:25.881 --> 00:11:28.190
on Dildo into the anus of her male partner.

155
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:32.930
I like how Bert thought it was the name that the pegging is when a guy fucks a

156
00:11:32.931 --> 00:11:34.040
guy that's just called fucking,

157
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:37.120
<v 5>yeah,
that's just how they fought.
Yeah,
yeah.
No,</v>

158
00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:41.040
this is a straight act as a stray people by fucking Christina

159
00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.520
I 12 years I've been threatening him with tagging,

160
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:50.320
but clearly you've shown interest in having your behind stimulated.

161
00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:54.250
You want to finger?
I've wanted yes.
Finger.
You've given the finger.

162
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.690
<v 6>No,
no,
don't even do that.</v>

163
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.670
My boyfriend's into stuff back there.
He just won't let himself admitted.

164
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.430
That's awesome.
One of the common fears about pegging is who?

165
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.540
I am afraid that it's just I'm going to get showered and shit,

166
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:11.500
but that's kind of the price is going to pay two to give them a good pegging.

167
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:15.400
Another fear is being seen as gay.

168
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:16.870
Is that a fear of yours?

169
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:22.530
I mean if somebody accuses me of being gay then I'll just come over their face.

170
00:12:22.991 --> 00:12:27.640
I guess he's been crushing my post.
Devastating it for years and years.
I know.

171
00:12:27.641 --> 00:12:28.530
I know.
He's straight.
Yeah.

172
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.153
<v 7>Yeah.
There's a bunch of,</v>

173
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.140
I'm going to fucking lose my mind if the dogs keep barking.

174
00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.590
So do you want to go take care of them and also let me call back instacart.

175
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.080
They'd called.
Did you beat the shit out of the dogs?
I wish I did.

176
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.750
I thought you were going to hit it everybody.
No,

177
00:12:44.751 --> 00:12:48.650
I just told him to shut the fuck up.
Oh my God.
I didn't know what I was saying.

178
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.240
He didn't speak English well.
Fiefs Englishes Amaz bitsy,

179
00:12:53.241 --> 00:12:55.310
not so much,
but it was who was barking?

180
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:59.630
I couldn't tell because they were done not barking when I went out there.
Oh,

181
00:12:59.631 --> 00:13:01.010
they're the backyard.
No,

182
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.290
they're just in the house to was barking at nothing.

183
00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.570
They bark at people.
They know they,
they've work at noises.

184
00:13:08.571 --> 00:13:13.310
They don't fucking bark at real things.
Are we recording right now?

185
00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.810
Yeah.
Oh,
I want to,
can I?
Okay.

186
00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:19.650
What do you think so much to talk about this a sidebar.
We,

187
00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:24.310
for those of you writing in,
we resolved bitsy diarrhea problem.

188
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.250
Say thanks for [inaudible] but first can I just talk about this?

189
00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.420
We got her a dog.
Burka.
It's like a little thing.
It covers her face.

190
00:13:32.421 --> 00:13:35.580
I'll show you a picture of it and now she can't eat.
It's giving her diarrhea.

191
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:39.230
So problem solved.
That's awesome.
Yeah,
it's great.
We um,

192
00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.240
we put her in her burka,

193
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:45.750
which goes out back so she can't eat rotten fruit and whatever else it is.
Yeah,

194
00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:49.160
we'll show you.
It looks retarded.
Okay.
So yes,
Nikki Glaser.
Thank you.

195
00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:53.900
It was super fun.
And the instructor was,

196
00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.990
remember that Australian lady we had on here that cut the hair out of her ears,

197
00:13:59.991 --> 00:14:04.750
cut her ear out of her hair?
It's a little of that aesthetic.
No,
Sheila.

198
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:08.780
I think so.
I don't know.
Maybe I'm a bad memory.

199
00:14:08.781 --> 00:14:13.110
I was tired that it wasn't like that.
Yeah,
no,
no,

200
00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:18.260
but she was like,
her name was ruby.
She,
she,

201
00:14:18.261 --> 00:14:23.120
the main thing that I really like respected about her when she was really great

202
00:14:23.121 --> 00:14:27.590
teaching the pegging class.
Yeah.
But she,

203
00:14:27.591 --> 00:14:32.090
I was like,
how did you get into this?
And she was,
you know,
whatever.

204
00:14:32.091 --> 00:14:35.080
Just discovered it.
And then I go,
how often do you do this?
She goes,
I like him.

205
00:14:35.081 --> 00:14:39.410
He young and pretty.
Yeah.
She was like,
like a dude talking about his conquest.

206
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.910
She's like,
yeah,
basically.
Fuck guys on the regular.
It's great.
Yeah.
Yeah.

207
00:14:43.911 --> 00:14:46.400
She's a sturdy lady too.
She off our ad.

208
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.470
You know what I thought was interesting about that class,

209
00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:50.570
which they did an air is we asked like,

210
00:14:50.571 --> 00:14:55.571
should we do two fingers or three fingers and your asshole versus a Dildo first

211
00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.250
member?
And she goes,
no,

212
00:14:58.251 --> 00:15:02.330
you may as well go for the dildo cause it's about the same.
Well,

213
00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.930
what she was saying,
no,
it was the,
I think it was the opposite.
It was,

214
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:10.100
hey that looks too big.
You know,
how about something the size of a finger?

215
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.180
And she goes,
well then just use a finger.
Like if you're gonna,

216
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:16.150
if you want something besides a totally different class,
you know,

217
00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.340
sounds like it sounds like.
Yeah.
If you want something the size of a finger,

218
00:15:19.341 --> 00:15:23.870
just use your finger.
Right.
You know,
which makes sense.
Yeah.

219
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.440
Which by the way,
since the class,
nothing's changed.

220
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:31.970
You still haven't done anything.
No fingers,
no toys,

221
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:32.923
nothing.

222
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.990
I still got this totally fucking just open,
kind of hanging out their ass hole,

223
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:44.240
waiting for something to come in.
Birthday passed.
It was my birthday.

224
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.890
Nothing.
Well I thought you were going to get your anus waxed before I did any.

225
00:15:48.891 --> 00:15:51.460
I never,
I never suggested I was going to do that.
No,

226
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:55.130
you've been talking about what it was completely after that.
That was after that.

227
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:59.270
After that conversation you're acting like that was part of no,

228
00:15:59.271 --> 00:16:01.130
it was totally separate from that.

229
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:05.930
I was talking about my wiping and that I want a clean asshole again.
Yeah,

230
00:16:05.931 --> 00:16:10.070
but what makes you think I want to get in there?
If it's covered in mud all.

231
00:16:10.071 --> 00:16:14.390
It's not about you.
It's muddy.
It's smelly.
By the way.
Your birthday.

232
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:18.580
Happy Smurf Day.
Thanks.
What was really nice?
I really appreciated this.

233
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:22.040
We were laying in bed and you lifted your legs.

234
00:16:22.041 --> 00:16:27.041
You're on your back and you lifted your two legs up like a baby diaper change

235
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:30.200
and then he farted and you were wearing nothing but boxers.

236
00:16:30.201 --> 00:16:34.190
You rent one and then you rolled over and you go,
so what's up?

237
00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.990
Am I going to throw you the day to day or what?
I don't sit on this d.
No,

238
00:16:38.991 --> 00:16:42.350
I didn't go.
Really?
You're going to,
after you farted on me.
I said,

239
00:16:42.351 --> 00:16:44.120
how about a blow job,
right.

240
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:48.850
Do you think now is the appropriate time to ask for something like that?
Yeah,

241
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:51.860
because there was no fart in there anymore.
It was gone now,

242
00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.540
so now you know I'm not going to fart during a Bj because,

243
00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.800
but why the theatrical?
I mean if you wanted me to touch her d,

244
00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:05.510
why the theatrical of pulling your legs behind your ears in your boxer shorts

245
00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:08.330
like you,
you went out of your way to be disgusting.

246
00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.900
I wasn't trying to be disgusting.
I was trying to,
no,

247
00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.160
I was trying to be comical about it.
Entertaining.

248
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:16.640
I didn't want you to just hear a boring fart like,
oh,
I hear this all the time.

249
00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:18.890
I'm trying to give you something cool to listen to.

250
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:22.790
Can we talk about the fight I had yesterday on the couch?
Which one?

251
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:25.670
The one that you were like,

252
00:17:25.671 --> 00:17:30.440
that really smells like poison because we had to mommy.
Yeah.
It's very rich.

253
00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:33.330
It's very,
it's very heavy.
I got the truffle Burger,

254
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.550
which makes a bad smell on the way out apparently.
And the fries.

255
00:17:37.551 --> 00:17:42.050
I did a heavy bag workout after we had those.
Oh my God.
You want to throw up?

256
00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:47.000
No,
because it had already settled,
but it really made the brown come out.

257
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.100
Really?
Oh yeah,
man.
It was the Umami Burger

258
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.840
<v 3>that made the brown or the heavy bag.
It was the fitness plus the food.</v>

259
00:17:54.841 --> 00:17:56.070
But the combination,

260
00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.400
I think of a rich burger and a pretty intense cardio workout.

261
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.430
You're going to brown every time.
It was just no way around it.
Did you?

262
00:18:05.431 --> 00:18:10.050
So which bathroom did you use?
Did you use a bad day?
Of course.
Of course.

263
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.400
I really prefer the downstairs.
The day it's warmer and stronger.

264
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:17.880
I need to,
what?
Can we get warm water upstairs?
I don't know.

265
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.430
And I know cold stream.
It's not the same.

266
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:26.070
It's a fucking firehose downstairs too.
It's so strong.

267
00:18:26.071 --> 00:18:30.360
My asshole hurts.
I know.
I kinda like it.
And it's like the seats super warm.

268
00:18:30.361 --> 00:18:34.200
Now I'm telling you,
I've gone,
I've even incorporate a little bit of your action.

269
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:38.700
I've got even gone.
Shit the button,
you know like yeah,

270
00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:40.530
that's what I did.
Yeah.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

271
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:43.560
Are you saying that you don't shit and then go straight to washing?

272
00:18:43.561 --> 00:18:46.530
Sometimes I go wipe one wipe first.

273
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.450
Why is it good?
Some of the general mud out,
but you're crazy.

274
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.730
I think you're wasting toilet paper at this point.

275
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.960
You need to go straight to water to hose.
Yeah.

276
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.910
And then it takes it off like paint,
you know,

277
00:18:59.911 --> 00:19:03.360
he really didn't have the power wash.
Cold water doesn't work the same.

278
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.690
Cold water doesn't work the same.
It's gotta be out.
Not the same.

279
00:19:06.691 --> 00:19:11.010
I know how really the key top dog taught me that.

280
00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:15.420
A lot of people were really into his phone call last week.
Big feedback on that.

281
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.290
It was really good.
It was,
it was ah,

282
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:23.380
the magic that he shot on his comforter bedspread embeds.
Right.

283
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:27.840
And got a little squirt on the best bread.
You know,

284
00:19:27.841 --> 00:19:29.550
I listened to that call again.
Yeah.

285
00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:33.150
And the part that really gets me is that he wasn't,

286
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:38.280
he didn't intend on washing it like he wouldn't have if he were living alone.

287
00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:43.140
That's the part that if you go old school,
and I mean episode,

288
00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:44.460
I couldn't even tell you the episode,

289
00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:49.890
but it's where my dad sharded when we were together.
Yeah.

290
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.310
It was the uh,
oh,

291
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:55.950
in Maine and Maine and he shat five feet too far.

292
00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:59.800
<v 8>Oh,
was yesterday.
I didn't make it and I was,
you know,</v>

293
00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:03.900
it was so ugly.
I had to go and you know,

294
00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:08.290
I misread the sign and the hotel and they had to go down the stairs and I,

295
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.350
I was squeezed squeezing the cheeks going down the stairs.
Yeah.

296
00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:16.420
And then went into one of these places,
you know,
where the,
you know,

297
00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:19.600
you're rushing,
but it's one of these handicap stalls.

298
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:23.320
It's an extra five feet before you get to them.
Yeah.

299
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:26.470
And is five feet too far,
five feet too far

300
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:31.690
<v 3>that whenever the episode,
whatever episode that was,</v>

301
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.920
he shit.
And he walked,
you know,

302
00:20:35.921 --> 00:20:40.380
I was in the bathroom in the hotel where we were sharing a hotel room,
Tommy,

303
00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:43.300
you done in there and like,
I'm taking a shit.
What are you,

304
00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:46.060
what are you fucking asking me if like he kept knocking and he goes,
yeah,

305
00:20:46.061 --> 00:20:48.070
I shit my pants.

306
00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:53.490
And I was laughing so hard and he told me what happened and then we're going to

307
00:20:53.501 --> 00:20:57.070
go out,
we're going to go out to a movie or something and I go,

308
00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.040
what are you doing with those pants?
And he's like putting them on and they go,

309
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:04.990
you just shitting them?
And he goes,
oh,
I shit in the underwear.
Oh man,
I go,

310
00:21:04.991 --> 00:21:07.720
but isn't there probably some on the pants.
He goes,

311
00:21:07.721 --> 00:21:12.370
it's just a little bit of shit and I go,
you can't fucking wear those.
So growth,

312
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:17.140
he wanted to wear them out.
Oh
it's so gross.

313
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:21.790
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's a lot of,
I have a lot of just shit clips from him.

314
00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:25.950
<v 9>Have
oil in them already.
Okay.</v>

315
00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:31.620
So this is,
is that the end of the day they were born,
they would burn it.

316
00:21:31.621 --> 00:21:35.910
They would take every game every day and they wouldn't everybody shit together.

317
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.350
He had multiple,

318
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:42.860
<v 3>he's talking about shitting in the Shit and Vietnam in the burn.
Yeah,</v>

319
00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:43.850
they're shit.

320
00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:47.070
<v 9>Yeah,
it was like a Porta potty.
Right,
right.
And then you would,
you would,</v>

321
00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.820
you would burn it.
Okay.
Okay.

322
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:52.770
And that's why they call it bean and did shit.
Right.
Cause right.

323
00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:57.750
Did you guys like,
would you try to shit in similar places?

324
00:21:57.751 --> 00:21:58.980
Like if I took a shit here,

325
00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:02.210
when you come by the same area or are you just share wherever you want to?
Shit.

326
00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.800
Wow.
You would grab the boy.
She just find it.

327
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.740
What you do is you dig a hole with your entrenching tool,

328
00:22:07.741 --> 00:22:10.020
which is a military term for shovel.

329
00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:15.900
And remember when you're in the kind of food you're eating and because you're

330
00:22:15.901 --> 00:22:17.370
burning up so many calories,

331
00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:22.590
the the size of poops we had were about what a dog does.
Oh really?
Yeah.

332
00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:27.000
Because isn't the military food designed them to block you up to like Mras now

333
00:22:27.001 --> 00:22:31.560
they say are designed to be like,
cause he experts we meet once a day.

334
00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:33.503
Why do I talk?

335
00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.610
<v 3>Do you hate luxury yourself?</v>

336
00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:44.590
So stupid.
Yeah.
Uh,
yeah,
it's horrible.
Oh,

337
00:22:44.591 --> 00:22:47.740
I got a bunch of those.
But um,
he uh,
yeah,

338
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:51.670
just a little bit of shit that's in there somewhere in that episode when an

339
00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:56.230
animal,
he's an animal.
I can now I see all these bottles.

340
00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.190
Just say top top,
top dog.
Like so old plan is here.

341
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.190
Hey Buddy.
Call.

342
00:23:05.191 --> 00:23:06.360
I don't know what this is about even.

343
00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:16.290
<v 9>Hello Tommy?
Yeah.
Hey Buddy,
how you doing?
What's up man?</v>

344
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:22.320
Just chilling right now.
I'm just chillin.
Chillin.
Okay.
Uh,

345
00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.910
uh,
I haven't talked to you a little bit of your dental work.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

346
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:31.320
Everything's going good,
you know,
good and uh,
been been feeling pretty good.

347
00:23:31.321 --> 00:23:36.010
You know,
your little traveling,
get the Orlando airport the other day.
Uh,

348
00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:38.380
the infamous Orlando Airport.
Yeah.

349
00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:43.550
I was in there a head to catch a flight to Memphis and a head.

350
00:23:44.341 --> 00:23:48.330
Now the turtle,
all of a sudden I felt one coming on.
I needed to,

351
00:23:48.331 --> 00:23:50.990
I needed to get in there and take it down the Pronto,

352
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:56.000
so I'll go into one of those,
you know,
terminal air,
men's rooms.

353
00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:56.840
Yeah.

354
00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:01.840
And every stall is full except the handicapped stall again.

355
00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:07.790
Really sorry.
So I charge in there,
you know,
really came on strong.
Uh,

356
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:09.263
sat down,

357
00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:14.530
drop my load immediately and then I looked in and there was only enough toilet

358
00:24:16.371 --> 00:24:20.700
paper for one wipe and this wasn't a single wipe down,
I'm assuming.
Oh,

359
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:25.430
this was Elise.
This is probably a five,
five,
maybe six.
Wiper.
Okay.

360
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:30.510
Is it,
would you classify it as like a glider or um,

361
00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.230
you know,
a blast or something like that?
Or is it just something,

362
00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:37.780
I wasn't a last year,
but it was,
um,
in between,
um,

363
00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:41.680
a slider and a sloppy Joe.
Hey,

364
00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:46.100
will you turn the TV down in the background?
Yep.
Yep.
Okay.
And so,

365
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.420
uh,
yeah,
all of a sudden I look over it and normally,
you know,

366
00:24:50.421 --> 00:24:52.790
as I've told you before,
when you're traveling,

367
00:24:52.791 --> 00:24:56.090
you got to check to make sure this bay,
I didn't,
I had no choice in the matter.

368
00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:59.390
You didn't do your Rico.
Yeah,
I'm actually super curious.
Right.

369
00:24:59.391 --> 00:25:02.180
Because I totally forget this call of how he cleaned this up.

370
00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.480
I don't know how I cleaned this up,

371
00:25:05.481 --> 00:25:09.530
whether he took his socks off or what do a recon because I had to go and there

372
00:25:09.531 --> 00:25:11.970
was no other stalls available.
So you know,

373
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:15.580
it was either there or on the floor.
Okay.
So,
right.

374
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:20.880
So what I did was all of a sudden I noticed that they have those,
you know,

375
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:25.790
totally papers covers that people use the toilet seat cover totally sick.

376
00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:30.080
I never used them personally.
But um,
always just sit on the seat.
Yeah,

377
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:33.500
I did yellow.
Sure.
Just set up,
see the too much trouble to use those things.
Yeah.

378
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.740
And then you position them wrong.
He ended up hitting him,
you know what I mean?

379
00:25:36.741 --> 00:25:40.070
And then you create a bigger mess.
So I don't use them,
but what I found out,

380
00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:46.020
you can take those chairman little pieces in you that it started paper route or

381
00:25:48.001 --> 00:25:48.380
he is

382
00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:53.060
<v 7>so that's that and use that.
Like you said it like a detective solving a case.</v>

383
00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:56.470
Right.
He's a brown lock right.
Tactic.
I've done that.

384
00:25:56.471 --> 00:26:00.410
You were at the house with her when she was there,
but I've done that too.

385
00:26:00.411 --> 00:26:05.150
Haven't you ever used the,
that is a a 12 paper.
That's why let's take cover.

386
00:26:05.151 --> 00:26:08.930
I have many occasions.
Many occasions.
Yeah.
Cause a lot of times the ladies room,

387
00:26:08.931 --> 00:26:11.900
there's no tp in the ladies room,

388
00:26:11.901 --> 00:26:16.700
no TV because women have to wipe it every time.
Number two,

389
00:26:16.701 --> 00:26:19.760
so.
Right,
right,
right,
right.
Yeah.
Sometimes you're out a lot.

390
00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:23.850
That makes sense though.
Yeah.
You can use that to wipe.
Okay.

391
00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:28.820
Ha.
Ah Ha ha.
Hey Dad,
what a genius.

392
00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:34.050
<v 9>Hey Buddy,
how you doing?
Good.
How are you?
A pretty good,
pretty good.
Yeah.</v>

393
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:39.530
No.
What's a,
what's going on?
Well,
just got a,

394
00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:44.340
my new favorite lunch.
She now is this seafood

395
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:47.870
<v 3>Cobb salad?
Fucking no,
I don't see,</v>

396
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:54.450
is that the club he goes to?
I don't know where it was.
The same place every day.

397
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:57.060
He goes yeah.
And the dual lane McDonald's.

398
00:26:57.061 --> 00:27:01.290
I remember he was not a fan of dual lane McDonald school.
Yeah.
Yeah.

399
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:05.190
But he still loves Mcdonald's coffee,
right?
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

400
00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:18.890
Oh my gosh.
Yeah.
Yup.
There you go.

401
00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:23.360
So it was your birthday this week.
It was my smurf day.
Um,

402
00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.720
by the way,
thanks for putting it out there to the,
um,

403
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:31.580
to the general public on Twitter.
Uh,
get,
tell Tom,
how old do you think he is?

404
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.700
I had quite a range.
Uh,
you'll never believe this,

405
00:27:34.701 --> 00:27:39.590
but nobody actually guests the actual age.
Everyone Kelly older.

406
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:44.290
Yeah.
Interesting.
So we gently older.

407
00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:47.510
Yeah.
So I had everything from,

408
00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:51.860
I think the youngest age I thought I saw was a happy 42nd birthday.

409
00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:56.810
And all the way up to,
I saw a lot of,
uh,
hey,
next year's the big five.
Oh,

410
00:27:56.811 --> 00:28:01.360
that's pretty cool.
Yeah.
All the way to 58 and 60.
But yes.
Yes.

411
00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:05.260
You are a young 60 though.
I think a young 60 years.

412
00:28:05.261 --> 00:28:07.850
You want to tell people what your actual ages or do you want to leave it a

413
00:28:07.851 --> 00:28:11.750
mystery?
Oh,
I'll tell them.
Yeah,
I'd,
I'd now officially 37 years old.

414
00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:17.120
I remember that flies by man.
37 years of your life.
Yeah.

415
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.930
And you can't believe it.
Like you hear it doesn't even sound right.

416
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:25.260
Do you feel like you're going to die soon?
Physically?
Yes.
Yeah.

417
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:27.890
I do feel like I'm going to die.
You really feel like you're falling apart.

418
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:32.600
Is that happening for you yet?
No.
I mean,
um,
this,
oh my God,

419
00:28:32.601 --> 00:28:34.670
put them on.
Okay,
wait,
but do this first.

420
00:28:34.671 --> 00:28:37.930
Look at the camera normal so that they see what your eyeballs look like.
Yeah.

421
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.530
And then put them on.
Now

422
00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:47.270
it magnifies your eyes.
You look like my Nana.
This is what my grandma used to.

423
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:52.940
Yeah.
Big Eyes.
Other kind of cool though.
I liked the frames.
I like them.

424
00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:56.960
They just,
they make your eyes look bigger while they make the words look bigger.

425
00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:02.150
And that's why I like him.
He's you wait,
you can't,
she,

426
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:06.160
when you're aware of him,
did you get those at the rite aid or are those three?

427
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.030
I'll get the fuck outta here.

428
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:11.690
These were a fortune glasses are really expensive cheeses.

429
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:12.501
I know you don't want to,

430
00:29:12.501 --> 00:29:15.080
you don't want to fuck those up and cost a fortune thing.
No,

431
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:18.230
but my parents just would go to rite aid and buy the rite aid ones.

432
00:29:18.231 --> 00:29:22.380
I Louie them to read now and look at computer basically.
Yeah.
Yeah.

433
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:26.040
And you're so old,
man,
doc.
So fucking bad.
Well,
I had the,
uh,

434
00:29:26.041 --> 00:29:29.710
I had the vision test a year ago and they were like,
Nah,

435
00:29:29.711 --> 00:29:33.050
I mean you could get them but you don't need them.
And I was like,
okay,
did,
uh,

436
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:36.800
you know,
a year later I went for the followup test and they were like,

437
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:41.830
absolutely need them now because of how poorly I was doing and I didn't bring

438
00:29:42.101 --> 00:29:45.760
them when I renewed my driver's license and they go,

439
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:48.090
you know the shit that I've done for years where she's like,

440
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:52.300
look up at that chart.
I okay.
And she goes to close one eye.
All right,

441
00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:53.470
read line for,

442
00:29:53.471 --> 00:29:58.300
and I go a c D v seven and she goes seven,

443
00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:02.980
seven.
And I go,
yeah.
And I took my hand down and it was a tea.

444
00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:07.880
Oh my gosh.
And she goes,
hold on,
read the,
and then she was,

445
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:10.870
now you just look with both eyes,
go look in this thing.

446
00:30:10.871 --> 00:30:15.280
She made me go to something else and I was reading it like,
um,

447
00:30:15.281 --> 00:30:19.380
I dunno if this is gonna fly right now.
I,
you know I,

448
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:21.250
I was in like in a little bit of a panic.

449
00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:26.050
What if I fail the vision test without these horse and I just up your whole

450
00:30:26.051 --> 00:30:28.830
world.
Oh,
your vision,
what,
what happens to you?
The dinner.

451
00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.660
I know cause I closed one,
I was reading through a little box,
you know,

452
00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:34.720
with that was backlit.
Ah.
And I,
I could see them,

453
00:30:34.721 --> 00:30:39.130
but then there was one that I couldn't really see and I go,
uh,

454
00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:43.390
five s cause I,
I was about to say a number again.
I go s s s and she was like,

455
00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:45.550
okay,
you had me worried for a second and I'm like,

456
00:30:45.551 --> 00:30:47.660
you fucking had me worried for a second.
Yeah.

457
00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:51.250
So now I know that I got to bring these more often or you got to bring him

458
00:30:51.251 --> 00:30:54.280
everywhere.
Yes.
Maybe you have a pair that you just leave in the car.

459
00:30:54.281 --> 00:30:55.114
I'm going to get a second

460
00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:58.320
<v 5>for driving.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Do you need,
is that for driving too?
You need them?</v>

461
00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:02.190
<v 3>They said,
um,
I mean like,
you know,
I see fine looking around,
whatever,</v>

462
00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:06.360
but they said if you're driving for a long time you might want to bust them out.

463
00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:11.700
I know fucking 70 going down and drive as I drive long and I don't see so good.

464
00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:14.993
Yeah,

465
00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:19.870
<v 5>man.
And I'm going to be 40 in June.
Whole Lee.
I know,
I know.</v>

466
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:23.950
It's really crazy.
What can I tell you something though?
I'm not as devastated.

467
00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:28.780
I think turning 30 was more horrible for me than then the idea of 40 because
I'm,

468
00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:32.800
I've accepted the fact that I'm an older person now.
I think 30 is when yeah,

469
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.850
<v 6>it once you commit,
you can't quit.
When then once you grab his Tsp,</v>

470
00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:40.220
someone wraps a rubber band around his mouth.
Hey,
make sure that mouth is closed.

471
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:50.640
I'm really scared because I'm afraid that a crock.

472
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:51.583
<v 5>So embarrassed.</v>

473
00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:57.180
<v 6>How did you do once you commit,
you can't quit
the team.</v>

474
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.530
I'm really scared because

475
00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:05.370
<v 5>look at me.
I'm fucking hot.
I'm a teenager.
Look at,
I'm a baby.
Oh my gosh.</v>

476
00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:08.880
Can you believe how young like look out.
I was a baby doing that,

477
00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:12.140
so I'll probably do later.
I'll bang you and then we'll turn it off.
Thanks video.

478
00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.013
I'm going to throw up.

479
00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:16.430
<v 6>I'm afraid that I now I was going to jump out of the water and try it.</v>

480
00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:20.580
<v 5>Bye.
Oh my God.
Oh,
fucking.
Why are you showing me this?
I was so depressed.</v>

481
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:25.070
All right.

482
00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:27.423

Monkeys.

Would you like to compare and contrast white boy seaman?

511
00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:32.490
Oh yeah.
To try to match.
Yeah,
that would be wonderful.

512

516
00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:48.160
I love road rules here.

517
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:51.430
Can I tell you the problem with doing that at 40 I just look like a mom.

518
00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:53.830
A mom can.
You can do that at 20 and you look cool.
Yeah.

519
00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:57.020
40 you look like you hate your husband.
And I go for a mom because

520
00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:04.520
mom's here.
You're an official mom.
Now I have to wear it.

521
00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:09.130
The Coo lots.
Those jorts that the moms wear some sandals.

522
00:35:09.131 --> 00:35:12.090
I got to cut my hair short.
That A,

523
00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:16.510
that low maintenance cut for moms saves a lot of time.
It's a time saver.
Yeah.

524
00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:21.100
Yeah.
Okay.
Anyway,
it says that John and Kate plus eight Oh,

525
00:35:21.101 --> 00:35:23.350
she hated him.
That's why she did that.

526
00:35:23.351 --> 00:35:25.750
That is a don't touch my post haircut for sure.

527
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:28.930
Stay the fuck away from my crutch.
Yeah.
So we went to,

528
00:35:28.931 --> 00:35:33.760
I took you to get Japanese massage.
Yeah.
Which was amazing.
And this was,

529
00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:37.980
I mean this was a,
a a high

530
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.660
<v 3>end spa.
Yeah.
It wasn't just like,
oh,
there's a couple of,
you know,</v>

531
00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:46.010
Japanese people in this strip mall.
This was like a,

532
00:35:46.011 --> 00:35:49.580
a really high end spa was a nice birthday treat.
Yeah.
Yeah.

533
00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:53.640
So where they make you wear like Kimono,
robes and stuff,

534
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:57.450
which was super fun.
And then there's a,
it's called a photo,

535
00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:01.510
a photo of bath and we walk like her would bath.
That's,
yeah.

536
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:05.840
It's like 150 degrees.
It feels awesome and the temperature never drops.
Yeah.

537
00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:09.200
It's amazing.
I don't really,
really crazy.
Anyway,
we were at,

538
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:11.650
at the bathtub and I was like boom,
they're getting away with it.

539
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:14.610
We should explain this first.
Okay,
go ahead.
We settle in.

540
00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:18.690
It's a whole like welcoming experience where they sit you down and you put on

541
00:36:18.691 --> 00:36:23.400
your,
your Komono,
the massage,
your feet.
I fell asleep during it.
It was,

542
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:24.720
that part was so good.
Yeah.

543
00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:29.160
And you liked the level of some of subservience there.
I love it.
A lot of bowing,

544
00:36:29.161 --> 00:36:32.460
a lot of May I enter sir,
May I?
It's just everything.
Okay Sir.
I love it.

545
00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:35.280
They're head's always lower than yours.
Absolutely.
Yeah.

546
00:36:35.281 --> 00:36:38.640
You liked that people know their place and then,
um,

547
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:42.270
we did the massage,
which was excellent.
And then they go,

548
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:44.343
<v 12>uh,</v>

549
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:47.070
<v 3>yeah,
the bath tubs over there.
It's in the same room.
You know,</v>

550
00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.610
you first said you go,
now you have a bath.

551
00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:55.440
And I thought because it's just a single tub that it was just for me cause I

552
00:36:55.441 --> 00:36:58.830
didn't understand that.
So I go,
okay.
Yeah.

553
00:36:58.831 --> 00:37:01.470
And then I go and then the lady comes and she washes you.

554
00:37:01.471 --> 00:37:05.100
She washes your cock and balls.
Yeah.
And the look on your face.

555
00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:09.620
You were so excited.
You're like,
what?
Really?

556
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:15.070
Like yeah,
it's your special day.
Yeah.
Like this is an expensive Jack Shack.

557
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:21.240
You said the,
the Lady's gonna wash your,

558
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:25.670
your cock and balls and I know what yeah.
And then,
and you go,
yeah.
You said yes,

559
00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.720
you go,
yeah.
And I go,
really?
And you got no,

560
00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:34.560
what if that was part of the package?
She's like,
okay,
no.

561
00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:39.480
Why should your Cutco and your,
and I really,
honestly,
I never,
when you said that,

562
00:37:39.481 --> 00:37:41.880
didn't think like,
hey,
this lady's going to get you off in here.

563
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:46.440
I thought you meant like this is such an authentic,
traditional old,

564
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:49.880
what they do in the whole country was like an actual bathing experience.

565
00:37:49.881 --> 00:37:51.750
And I was like,
no fucking shit.
Yeah.

566
00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:54.720
I thought someone's going to come with a sponge and just cleaned me off

567
00:37:54.721 --> 00:37:57.930
everywhere.
Right.
And I was like,
wow.
Then you gotta know

568
00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:04.080
you gotta wash your own cock and balls.
Yeah.
It's kind of neat.

569
00:38:04.081 --> 00:38:09.060
They let you shower and sit in a bathtub together and they,
it's the very rare,

570
00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:11.310
most places they think you're going to have sex.

571
00:38:11.311 --> 00:38:14.550
They don't let men and women be naked together in the same room.
Yeah.

572
00:38:14.551 --> 00:38:16.980
You know what I mean?
Like I never been to a spa where they're like,
yes,

573
00:38:16.981 --> 00:38:21.030
you're an adult.
Yeah.
Surely you can handle this responsibility of being nude.

574
00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:24.880
Sure.
Together.
Well,
you did your duty before that come everywhere.
Yeah,

575
00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:26.043

<v 7>Let me Daddy.</v>

587
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:13.650
This is like kind of like the calm gov product that we tried to pitch the shark

588
00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:17.870
tank because this girl is comparing all the different races,
you know?
Right.

589
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.840
I feel like shark tank.

590
00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:24.520
<v 13>Nice white boy,

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:43.493

I want you to hear the songs that this guy just sent it to.

597
00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.320

601
00:40:10.831 --> 00:40:12.870
Can you think of anything worse in life?

602
00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:17.550

604
00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:24.210
I'd rather sponge bath strangers than Blue Lake.
Suck their genes there.

605
00:40:24.211 --> 00:40:25.044
Gene juice.

606
00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.073
<v 11>Oh.</v>

That was sewn rice day.
Dude.
That's a worst job in the world.

633
00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:48.330
I would rather dig ditches and pick up garbage in the streets for the rest of my

634
00:42:48.331 --> 00:42:53.160
life and do what that woman did in that one clip.
Seriously,

635
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:57.990
dig ditches.
I'd rather pick up at garbage all day,
every day by the freeway.

636
00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:01.140
Really?
Yup.
And do that one scene

637

Anything worse?
I mean know if you're,
if you're asking me,

638
00:43:07.831 --> 00:43:12.480
I would definitely take those ditches to for the rest of my day,
every day,

639
00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:15.730
90 years old and digging ditches and I'm happy about it.
[inaudible] Shit.

Ha.
So what are these songs just play and you're going to look at it.

642
00:43:23.611 --> 00:43:27.780
You don't really have it.

Yes.
Okay.

645
00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:47.480

If there's one thing I know in this world,

646
00:43:47.481 --> 00:43:51.800
it's dicks and Coxson balls.
What are you doing?

00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:57.960
Blue man?
Help me get,

The next one's a song for real.

648
00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:01.040

649
00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:31.970

651
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:39.120

Blue Band.
I'm the president of the Dixon.

652
00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:47.760
I'm the president of the Dixie Song Faggot.
Wow,

653
00:44:47.761 --> 00:44:52.370
you're so you're so full of hate.
I had no idea.
You are so hateful.

654
00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:57.080
Finally got sick of being the one that gets caught all the time,
Huh?
Yeah.
Gotcha.

655
00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:00.540
You're such a Shit Turd.
He brought up the road rules.

656
00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:03.740
If there's one thing I know in this world,
it's dicks and Cox and balls.

657
00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:09.240
It's true.
First of all,
blue ban brought up road rules on his own.

658
00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:13.510
Sure he did.
Sure.
He said he just brought that look.
Yeah,

659
00:45:13.511 --> 00:45:18.270
but he submits all the potential clips and then you choose this time.

660
00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:22.860
Well,
I mean it was a good choice and you're the worst.
Is that it?

661
00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:26.940
Is there one more sound?
No,
that's it.
Speaking of Fuck Boys,

662
00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:33.080
you know we've been getting these horse shit emails about how fuck boy isn't

663
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:38.280
about gay gay things and you guys come on,
grow up.
Everybody knows it is.

664
00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:40.980
First of all,
let's look at the urban dictionary.

665
00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:44.250
I'm going to look it up for you right now.
Listen,

666
00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:49.230
Urban Dictionary fuckboy a person who is a weak ass pussy.

667
00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:53.460
That ain't about shit.
Look at this.
Weak as fuck.
Boy.

668
00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:58.630
Sounds pretty clear to me.
That was very pretty clear to me too.

669
00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:02.460
Some people are like,
no,
it means player.
No,
no.

670
00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.150
It means a person who was a weak ass pussy.
That ain't about shit.

671
00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:11.190
Look at that weak ass.
Fuck Blake's urban dictionary.
That's true.

672
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:14.950
I didn't make that shit up.
Anyway.
Pro,
you know,

673
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:18.870
hot debate solved.
Absolutely.
Um,

674
00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:22.680
I also want to point out to saying that road rules club man,

675
00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:28.400
80 years old now I want to point out to our faith fans of the show that I do now

676
00:46:30.421 --> 00:46:32.520
have my DJ equipment.

677
00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:37.270
I'm going to be hooking it up in the garage.
Um,

678
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:41.850
I kept it out of the nursery so we found that compromise,

679
00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:47.210
but I should be spinning pretty soon.
I was in Vegas this weekend.

680
00:46:47.211 --> 00:46:50.820
I got to tell you this,
I found out.
Yeah,

681
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:55.560
I did a private on Thursday.
Um,

That sounds like when you're like,

682
00:46:55.561 --> 00:46:58.890
I did a private,
it sounds like you're saying I'm a Dick and ball expert.

683
00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:04.050
I am a ticking box,
but I did.
I did a private,

684
00:47:04.051 --> 00:47:05.270
if there's one thing I know in this world,

685
00:47:05.271 --> 00:47:09.350
it's dicks and Cox and ball and I'm the president of the Dixon,
you know,

686
00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:15.360
and that's what they hire you for your private private private event.

687
00:47:15.361 --> 00:47:17.160
It was a corporate event.
There's are always dicey.

688
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:19.290
You never know how it's going to go.
But ended up being,

689
00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:23.850
it was with a bunch of um,
uh,
rich,

690
00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:27.660
rich as Fuck Texts and oiled people on linkedin.

691
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:31.510
We all met on Linkedin and they hired me to do a standup show.
They were,

692
00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:36.570
a lot of them were amp for the show,
but I got to say it,

693
00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:39.670
they still,
they treated me right.
I had a good time.

694
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:43.490
I got to give a shout out to half jap Ricky what,

695
00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:46.540
who have jap Ricky and Kurd.

696
00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:50.840
So both of them,
uh,

697
00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:56.410
kind of organized everything and um,
yeah,
we,
you know,

698
00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:00.910
we did the show full charge came with me.
Um,
there was,

699
00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:02.590
there was a lot of memorable moments.

700
00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:06.430
It was just kind of felt like a high end bar show,
you know,

701
00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:11.140
like it was like,
uh,
yeah,
Ph do's where you're like yelling shit.

702
00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.360
A Guy I thought almost died,

703
00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:17.920
literally almost died in the audience and he might be dead now.
He,
um,

704
00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:21.430
cause there were a couple of guys that were passed out in the like in the seat.

705
00:48:21.431 --> 00:48:26.080
So you saw ha just completely out.
And one dude,

706
00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:28.840
I was like,
hey,
maybe check his pulse because it was old.

707
00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:34.090
And he was like leaning forward.
Like that kind of made,

708
00:48:34.091 --> 00:48:37.450
he made some gesture and then later I go,
that guy really looks dead now.

709
00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:42.250
And they,
someone tapped him and he caught his breath.

710
00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:46.450
But it was like,
it went from being funny,
the scary cause you went

711
00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:51.340
like that and I was like,
um,
you all right.
And when I said,
are you all right?

712
00:48:51.341 --> 00:48:54.500
He went thumbs down.
Oh my God.
And I go,
uh,

713
00:48:54.501 --> 00:48:57.370
and then the security came over and tried to escort him out and he wouldn't

714
00:48:57.371 --> 00:49:00.900
leave.
So in the end,
he,
um,

715
00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:06.210
after the show he still had help leaving the room and then they go,

716
00:49:06.881 --> 00:49:11.140
oh,
he ate shit and broke his nose on the way to his room and fell and broke his

717
00:49:11.141 --> 00:49:15.670
nose.
He 37 years old.
No,
he was 137 years old.

718
00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:18.970
He was really old.
So he was just hammered.
Well,
no,

719
00:49:18.971 --> 00:49:22.600
he was old hammered and they said,
uh,
I know he had,

720
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:26.080
they said he had sleep apnea.
No boy,
you could see when he caught his breath,

721
00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:28.840
that's what,
what happens to people.
Like they catch their breath.

722
00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:33.640
That's really dangerous that that guy's going to sleep right now in his room.

723
00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:37.510
Um,
but I'd like to know if he's dead so I can add it to my bio.

724
00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:41.380
That's a good point.
Could you say if you were a hacky comic,
you can be like,

725
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:46.400
I killed the show literally.
Or if you're not hacky,

726
00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:51.370
just kind kill confirmed kill would be a great name for a fucking special.

727
00:49:51.371 --> 00:49:56.170
Right.
And then you could be in sniper gear on the cover.
On the box cover.
Yeah.

728
00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:00.310
But at the end of your gun is a microphone.
I liked that.

729
00:50:00.311 --> 00:50:02.890
But then do you have the caution tape over your mouth too?
Like,

730
00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:06.420
well you have caution tape as where they put black stripes under your eyes.

731
00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:10.690
Caution car.
Yeah.
And what's your comedy shirt?

732
00:50:10.691 --> 00:50:13.930
Are you wearing a comedy shirt?
I'm wearing the flame shirt with flames on it.

733
00:50:13.931 --> 00:50:14.260
Yeah,

734
00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:19.260
definitely Dj Dad mouth for a couple couple of comics I saw had those back in

735
00:50:19.391 --> 00:50:24.130
the day where I would be like,
of course.
So up and that was their shirt.

736
00:50:24.131 --> 00:50:27.380
You know,
it's a show comedy shorts.
Some people have comedy shirts.
Yeah.

737
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:31.840
<v 5>And then you learn all shirts or comedy shirts,
shirt.</v>

738
00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:36.050
Do just wear any shirt.
Speaking of uh,
comedy shirts and attire.

739
00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:39.680
Some really neat comments on my Instagram,
uh,

740
00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:42.820
regarding my art teacher jacket.
Then you,

741
00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:45.530
you can call it the art jacket.
Let me,

742
00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:50.180
let me pull up some great ones from our listeners.
So funny dude.

743
00:50:50.181 --> 00:50:55.120
I absolutely love when people,
hey,
Hey Hitler,
this is on Instagram.

744
00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:57.830
There's so much Hitler on my Instagram.
Hey Taylor.

745
00:50:58.070 --> 00:51:02.750
I disagree with Tom and most of these comments,
not an art teacher jacket.

746
00:51:02.751 --> 00:51:07.180
Classy.
Well dressed,
high and tight fashionista.
Sorry for big words,
but you know,

747
00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:11.570
you know you mean all the real mommy's?
No,
this butthole is on fleek.

748
00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:16.400
Your art skills are high and tight,
mom.
No.
What I'm saying?
Can you grade my work?

749
00:51:16.401 --> 00:51:21.050
Mrs P
is that my mom or an art teacher?

750
00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:23.400
Macaulay Culkin told me to pray.

751
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:27.050
Told me in prayer that we should start treating your coat like it was famous.

752
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.950
<v 3>Oh,</v>

753
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:33.950
we also got a comment from your friend who is an art teacher who said she was

754
00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:39.410
deeply offended.
Yeah.
She's like,

755
00:51:39.411 --> 00:51:41.220
what guys?
Come on.

756
00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:42.810
<v 5>I love this one.</v>

757
00:51:42.811 --> 00:51:46.890
Where are we supposed to read the chapter on Rembrandt or on neoclassicism this

758
00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:51.000
weekend?
I was plenty,
so thank you guys for chiming in on that.
Everyone agreed.

759
00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:54.510
It's absolutely an art teacher jacket.
Yeah,
I guess.

760
00:51:54.511 --> 00:51:56.910
I think I'm still going to wear it.
I don't give a shit to a class.

761
00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:58.260
<v 3>Are you going to wear it to do shows</v>

762
00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:03.100
whenever teacher Jane Pauley by

763
00:52:05.490 --> 00:52:09.150
you really did get this stuff.
I know,
I know you have your table set up,

764
00:52:09.151 --> 00:52:11.220
you have everything ready to go.
Ready to go,
man.

765
00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:14.700
I just got to hook some things up there.
I actually got a computer cause I can't,

766
00:52:14.701 --> 00:52:18.260
I don't have any room left on this computer,
so I've got a computer to,
you know,

767
00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:21.120
spin stuff like that.
Do get,
Oh this is,
what am I to tell you?

768
00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:25.920
This will make you shit your fucking pants.
So I'm hanging out at the encore.

769
00:52:25.921 --> 00:52:27.000
I'm talking to,

770
00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:33.500
to the entertainment director and encore beach club is basically all the vague,

771
00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:35.611
you know,

772
00:52:35.611 --> 00:52:40.050
Vegas is just designed to make money and you make it and a lot of different
ways.

773
00:52:40.051 --> 00:52:42.960
Obviously there's gambling,
there's dining,
right?
Um,

774
00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:48.210
but for the daytime and for uh,
the in shape crowd,

775
00:52:48.211 --> 00:52:52.620
the whole thing is to go there.
Yeah,
yeah.
The people,
it's so true.

776
00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:54.570
People that are fucking young and hot,

777
00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:57.900
they go to Vegas and they go to the kind of the

778
00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:02.100
<v 5>pardon.
Yes,
that</v>

779
00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:06.560
<v 3>is is,
it's 140 degrees outside.
They stand outside.
There's,</v>

780
00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:11.580
there's mist spray and then there's a Dj spinning and,

781
00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:18.300
and they bring in the top top people,
right?
Yeah.
Would get a Calvin Harris.

782
00:53:18.301 --> 00:53:21.930
I don't know.
So I go to those guys.

783
00:53:21.931 --> 00:53:25.980
What kind of money to those Djs make?
And they were like,
dude,
they have,

784
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:30.240
<v 7>I won't give out cause I don't want to,
but they have two prices.</v>

785
00:53:31.610 --> 00:53:34.650
How do they have two prices while they have the uh,

786
00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:40.220
the premixed set where they press play or the live set where they'll play a lot

787
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:46.080
more.
Yeah.
And he goes,
and a lot of,
you know,

788
00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:50.850
the pre mixed set is,
all I can say is this,

789
00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:52.680
it's well,

790
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:58.190
well into six figures and it's for a two hour set and that's press play.

791
00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:00.360
That's,
he shows up,

792
00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:04.480
he sets up his shit and there's a lot of ladies,
right?

793
00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:09.450
Press play and then it's premium stand there and they just go,
Yup,

794
00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:13.170
Yup.
That's all you have to do.
If you want to pay even more,

795
00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:18.350
you get them doing it in real time to the job that they're supposed to be doing

796
00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:23.750
and they get paid how much more to actually do the job even more into six

797
00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:27.420
figures and standup comedy by the way,

798
00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:32.660
is so fucking hard and it takes a decade to get decent at and we don't get paid

799
00:54:33.991 --> 00:54:35.040
nearly as much.

800
00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:40.040
Finally that I actually was so far cad uninformed with like what these guys

801
00:54:40.561 --> 00:54:43.420
play.
I was like,
wait a minute.
So what are they play though as the,

802
00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.750
I was asking because I,
I honestly didn't know.

803
00:54:45.751 --> 00:54:48.420
The djs that I know are hip hop Djs,
right?

804
00:54:48.421 --> 00:54:52.800
So I know who they are and the kind of music is played,
but I go,
what,

805
00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:56.730
what kind of music is played by one of these guys?
And he goes,
oh,
it's music.

806
00:54:56.731 --> 00:54:57.564
You know,

807
00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:02.760
so it's like Rihanna or no fucking Taylor swift.

808
00:55:03.210 --> 00:55:07.950
But then it's his remix of that.
And so they're actually playing songs,

809
00:55:07.951 --> 00:55:10.140
you know,
just a remix.

810
00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:14.070
And for that they're commanding that kind of money.
Absurd.

811
00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:17.670
It's not even like their own music song.

812
00:55:17.671 --> 00:55:20.130
It's just yeah they're playing someone else's shit.

813
00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:23.910
So that would be like you going to a comedy club doing like I'm doing Carlin's

814
00:55:23.911 --> 00:55:28.911
tonight guys and you do someone else's jokes but you do like your wacky

815
00:55:29.251 --> 00:55:33.660
impression of him or you record yourself doing someone else's jokes and just

816
00:55:33.661 --> 00:55:36.000
push play in front of an audience.
And they were like half a million.

817
00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:40.880
Give it to us.
That even acceptable to do a prerecorded.
Um,

818
00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:43.710
that's fucking crazy.
So I read this article,

819
00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:48.800
my friend Eric sent me about these girls who for an art project decided to

820
00:55:49.471 --> 00:55:50.880
become fake Dj's.

821
00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:56.670
So what this girl never deejayed in her life but she took like a cursory lesson

822
00:55:56.671 --> 00:56:01.670
so she knew how to do it and basically what she paired up with her cute friend,

823
00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:02.760
these two cute girls,

824
00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:07.650
cause that's like the cool thing to do to women are better than one and they

825
00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.840
would use songs that everybody knew.

826
00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:14.190
So she's like basically that audience that loves his DJ stuff is a commodity,

827
00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:18.960
like a commodified audience or whatever.
They only like shit that they know.
Like,

828
00:56:18.961 --> 00:56:22.140
I don't give a fuck about actual music.
Right.
It's just like,

829
00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:24.030
is this familiar gay?
Yeah.

830
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:24.491
<v 5>And she's like,</v>

831
00:56:24.491 --> 00:56:29.491
we put together the hackiest set list and within three weeks all the other djs

832
00:56:29.501 --> 00:56:32.590
hated them by the way.
And the Dj community were like,
what the fuck is this?

833
00:56:32.591 --> 00:56:33.820
Like it's so formulaic,

834
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.820
like it's too hot chicks spending shit that everybody knows.
And they're like,

835
00:56:36.821 --> 00:56:39.850
exactly.
That's why this culture sucks so bad.

836
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:42.550
And within three weeks they had major gigs.

837
00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:47.200
They were like one of the most popular whatever Dj acts at the time.
Yeah.

838
00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:50.020
I'll send you the link to this article.
What's her tits?

839
00:56:50.021 --> 00:56:54.790
Started deejaying Paris Hilton.
I know.
And it'd be fun.
And she was,
you know,

840
00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:02.000
the worst human being.
She was probably getting six figures to do that.
Easy.
Yeah.

841
00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:04.490
But she gets money to just show up at your party.
Sure.

842
00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:08.920
To show up at a bar and be like,
I'm here guys.
Like is there anything worse?

843
00:57:08.921 --> 00:57:13.170
And culture,
fucking God,
that is the worst

844
00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:18.250
<v 3>mail from a fan.
What?
Sometime Kachina little baby jeans too.
Oh,</v>

845
00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:22.360
here is the dubstep drop.
My two sons and I made with garage band the other day.

846
00:57:22.610 --> 00:57:26.800
Hope you liked the track and went to get us signed to your label before Cain or

847
00:57:26.801 --> 00:57:29.860
drag it through us.
Um,
okay.

848
00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:34.210
Kids are three and six and my old is 40 fucking one.

849
00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:35.650
No Dad mouth though.

850
00:57:35.651 --> 00:57:40.651
I brushed twice a day with my Sonicare toothbrush and floss at least once every

851
00:57:40.961 --> 00:57:45.340
two days.
That's about everything for now.
First time caller,
long time listener.

852
00:57:45.790 --> 00:57:49.480
Love the show and love you like my favorite pair of jeans.

853
00:57:49.481 --> 00:57:54.100
Let's see what he marries.
Time long time for us.
Long time.
First Time

854
00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:01.013
<v 14>afraid.</v>

855
00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:14.053
<v 13>Yeah.</v>

856
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:22.590
<v 5>Good job.
You're saying.
Yeah,</v>

857
00:58:22.591 --> 00:58:27.040
so this guy made this with his two small children and it sounds identical to the

858
00:58:27.041 --> 00:58:30.250
horse shit that passes for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Pretty much.

859
00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:34.480
I liked that was good.
I liked it too.
Yeah.
Wow Dude.

860
00:58:34.481 --> 00:58:37.000
You're going to make a killing as a DJ.
That'd be so funny.

861
00:58:37.001 --> 00:58:39.700
If you ended up making just millions as a DJ,

862
00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:44.950
hilarious comedian and you stopped doing comedy.
People are like,
no,

863
00:58:44.951 --> 00:58:49.600
but her Thompson girl,
the Dj,
even better.
I do's Carmen's black.

864
00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:54.040
It was Dan.
It was sex been I need to get a Netflix special spinning.

865
00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:56.080
That'd be great.
Just so boring to watch

866
00:58:59.770 --> 00:59:04.030
<v 3>turning knobs and shit.
Uh,
yeah.</v>

867
00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:08.410
It's also a very European thing though,
Dude.
My tribe I love that.

868
00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:12.640
Loves that Shit that
Oh yeah.

869
00:59:12.641 --> 00:59:16.300
I remember there was a German girl who,
uh,

870
00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:20.410
I worked with when I had a day job and she was like,

871
00:59:20.411 --> 00:59:22.310
why nobody here likes house music,

872
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:27.010
<v 7>like houses the best.
Nobody likes to go dancing.
I was like,
I dunno.</v>

873
00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:31.550
Wack wack job.
But uh,
you're in the fucking us of a now.

874
00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:35.560
Her Dad,
we listened to Bruce Springsteen here.
It's your boss all day or day.

875
00:59:35.890 --> 00:59:38.900
Do you want to do what you do?
You don't do it,
but a,
we don't do that.

876
00:59:38.901 --> 00:59:39.860
Dance in your shit here.
Okay.

877
00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:43.830
<v 0>Okay.
Oh my fucking cut.
Oh Shit.
Like,
like cut.</v>

878
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:50.590
<v 7>That's her.
Somebody barked at.</v>

879
00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:55.370
Yeah,
that was perfect timing.
Yeah.
So my cat,
my cat and my cat,
by the way.

880
00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:59.490
Thanks for all the emails letting me know that Linkedin is actually helpful.

881
00:59:59.491 --> 01:00:02.810
A lot of that.
A lot of liquidity.
Yeah,

882
01:00:02.811 --> 01:00:06.230
I know it's a professional website guys.

linkedin actually is help people have found jobs on linkedin.
Sure.

884
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:15.080
Money on Linkedin.
Of course,

885
01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:19.760

886
01:00:19.761 --> 01:00:21.320
I'm a fucking dog trainer.

887
01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:28.640
Why are people asking to Comedians to join linkedin?

888
01:00:28.641 --> 01:00:31.520
Like my dad keeps sending us these requests and I'm like,

889
01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.940

there's nothing to offer a Lincoln Shit jokes.

891
01:00:38.770 --> 01:00:42.740
It's not talking about wiping on linkedin.
Yeah,

892
01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:47.660
it's not for you motherfucker.
You say for you man.
This is too advanced.

893
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:52.460
Okay,
Kai.
Um,

894
01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:54.350
Speaking of your pops,

895
01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:58.370

896
01:00:58.910 --> 01:01:00.800
Eh,

I love the show.

898
01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:10.530
<v 0>My strange addiction.
We are in the Berg.
My name is Kyle.</v>

899
01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:15.540
I love the grandmas.
I met this lady in a wine named Karen.

900
01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:17.690
I saw her pictures.
I thought she was absolutely.

901
01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:20.690
I am so looking forward to meet her tonight.

902
01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:25.370
<v 7>Pictures I saw are pleasers pitchers like photography,</v>

903
01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.550
photography and I love looking at pictures.

904
01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:33.620
Allow la La local puck of old ladies.
What's a pitcher?

905
01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:37.310
What do you think his deal is?
What's the deal with old Nana's?
He's Nana puss.

906
01:01:37.311 --> 01:01:40.970
His fucking grandma jerked him off and he was a little baby and he's trying to

907
01:01:40.971 --> 01:01:43.550
get back in there.
That's what I think you're right.
Yeah.

908
01:01:43.551 --> 01:01:47.140
Something weird happened with no of course.
Of course.
Of course.

909
01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:51.090
<v 0>Lips are really red,
younger.</v>

910
01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.540
Her mouth.
She's got that mom was a bit nerve wracking

911
01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:58.900
<v 7>because
she's younger than I am.</v>

912
01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:00.970
I've got butterflies in my tummy.

913
01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:05.410
Looks like you got butterflies in your tummy and you've got rodents in your

914
01:02:05.411 --> 01:02:07.850
mouth cause those are rotten.

915
01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:12.670
Who talks like that one?
Butterflies in my tummy.
That's a big one.

916
01:02:12.671 --> 01:02:16.660
That's a cap and then she shouldn't see cause I had the same thing this is going

917
01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:21.480
to take,
you got to match them.
You can't just do one front tooth right here.

918
01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:26.850
It's real brown can fix.
You know you can just bond that shit.

919
01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:30.780
This is tough to fix.
This is what I'm going to look like when those eye bags,

920
01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:33.930
well we're going to fuck and how do you fix that?

921
01:02:33.931 --> 01:02:36.720
Can you get dry bags removed for sure.
Going to the knife.

922
01:02:36.721 --> 01:02:41.110
We live in fucking line.
Of course.
I'm going to do that later.
Yeah.

923
01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:43.890
Can I tell you what?
She doesn't look that bad if she fixed.

924
01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:46.740
I don't think she looks bad at all,
but I think her mouth is horrendous.

925
01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:51.120
What does it smell like?
It smells like fucking farts,
man.
It smells terrible.

926
01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:56.660
I've got better flight flies in my current right now in my diaper.

927
01:02:59.590 --> 01:03:02.630
<v 6>It hasn't happened in so long.
Such a chunk.</v>

928
01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:10.240
She looks sexy as hell,
but long climb in Paris.
I thought,
wow,

929
01:03:11.170 --> 01:03:12.550
it's so great to finally meet you

930
01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:19.910
<v 7>and pictures looking at all your pictures and they're real pretty.</v>

931
01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:22.940
Anything aside.
She's crazier than cat shit.

932
01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:26.240
This checks in our fucking gears to crazy.

933
01:03:27.590 --> 01:03:30.820
<v 6>Oh,
that's so sweet of you.
Just say that.
I keep telling you.</v>

934
01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:33.920
Why did you respond?
Like how do we end up there?

935
01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:37.930
I look at like all of these celebrity women that are going out with younger men

936
01:03:37.931 --> 01:03:42.280
and I thought,
well,
you know,
maybe I should try it.
You seem to be intelligent,

937
01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:46.510
although I'm not going to say that I necessarily decided to come out with you

938
01:03:46.511 --> 01:03:47.590
because of your mind

939
01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:52.120
and to be able to feel like this again.

940
01:03:52.121 --> 01:03:56.910
You knew just oh Ah,
Ooh,

941
01:03:57.860 --> 01:03:59.920
happen next.
But it will be brand new.

942
01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:04.040
<v 7>What's going to happen next is your oral decay is going to lead to a heart
issue.</v>

943
01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:07.070
<v 6>Yeah.
For it is.
So you've done a lot of traveling and rung.</v>

944
01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.210
I'm going to pause for a second.

945
01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:12.610
<v 7>Where did this full taker where like Mozzarella sticks or on the year they had</v>

946
01:04:12.611 --> 01:04:15.700
Denny's.
I Dunno.
It's disgusting somewhere.
Nice Dude.

947
01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:18.580
Fuck Olive Garden.

948
01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.880
So tired babe.
Can I,

949
01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:28.260
can I be good for her that she's,
she's pulling some young tail.
Yeah.
No,
I'm here.

950
01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:31.330
I ain't hating on that.
It's just,
it's,
it's crazy.

951
01:04:31.331 --> 01:04:35.740
She looks crazy and we are more conditioned to seeing old fucking piece of shit.

952
01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:40.780
Thank you.
The wretched ugly dad mouse with the hot young things.

953
01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:45.700
How's Basset Hound?
They look so horrendous.

954
01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:49.410
Beautiful young women.
And you're like,

Yeah,
because of,
you know,

955
01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:52.360
scratch of course.
But she's in it.
She's getting it.

956
01:04:52.361 --> 01:04:55.450
Just because it's good friends.
His Dick.
It's hard with them.
Yes.

957
01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:58.330
There's someone for everyone.
That's the lesson to the story.

958
01:04:58.480 --> 01:04:59.740
You kind of has weird teeth to,

959
01:04:59.770 --> 01:05:02.710
his lips are a little red for my liking on the man.
Yeah.

960
01:05:03.050 --> 01:05:06.890
<v 6>Would you go with like someone like me cause I'm old enough to be your mother.</v>

961
01:05:06.891 --> 01:05:07.724

962
01:05:10.290 --> 01:05:13.090
<v 15>Ah,

963
01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:18.250

<v 7>no.
You gotta go get that fixed.</v>

965
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:28.030
You've got to make that linkedin is helpful.
You got to,

966
01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:32.800
you gotta start a go fund me.
Jesus.

967
01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:37.940
Black decay is not cool and that's any age that's not just on acceptable.

968
01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:42.400
Fix your damn teeth.
You don't,
you skip clothes,
you skipped,

969
01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:44.410
you skipped meals at use.

970
01:05:44.411 --> 01:05:47.920
Skip paying your bills and you just get your teeth fucking fixed.

971
01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:51.970
That's what you do when your shit looks like that.
God dammit.

972
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:54.770
It is so upsetting to her.

973
01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:58.410
Especially because she doesn't need to get those big white,

974
01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:05.910
she doesn't need to get the Steve Harvey's needs to fix the decay on that too.

975
01:06:06.121 --> 01:06:09.970
Then I'd say white and not just look at what shader to,
yeah,
yeah.

976
01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:13.930
I can someone just do this work for her for,
for looks like beetle juice.

977
01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:15.550
Like Michael Keaton.

978
01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:22.650
I got to give up if you want to get a load of me.
Yeah,

979
01:06:22.651 --> 01:06:27.100
it's totally over buddy.
Give me a little kiss.

980
01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:30.590
Totally.
Beetle juice man.
Totally.
Dang.
Dang.

981
01:06:32.690 --> 01:06:33.523
Oh well

982
01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:39.800
she's not totally time.

983
01:06:41.770 --> 01:06:44.080
She goes,
get on all fours.

984
01:06:44.830 --> 01:06:47.240
I'm going to have it low desert from the backside.

985
01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:53.310
How do you think I got this to the whole Brown Brown too.
Yeah.

986
01:06:59.570 --> 01:07:04.300
The day was,
Karen was incredible.
She was a 100% my type,

987
01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:07.393
I'm gonna throw up.

988
01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:12.630
I had a wonderful time with and I've had such an amazing time.

989
01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:14.370
I just don't want it to end

990
01:07:18.270 --> 01:07:21.310
throw up a penis is pointing inward right now.

991
01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:25.870
It was so upsetting.
It really,
it's only the tooth.

992
01:07:25.871 --> 01:07:30.220
I don't care about the other stuff.
It's like,
dude,

993
01:07:30.221 --> 01:07:31.600
just fucking get your life.

994
01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:36.130
Get Jar because man,
I'm telling you,

995
01:07:36.131 --> 01:07:39.910
I had to replace my two front teeth every 10 years and we were broke as a joke,

996
01:07:39.911 --> 01:07:43.760
but we put money,
get mama teeth,
you know,
we got,

997
01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:48.040
we had debt from it.
You know?
Yeah.
Because it's that important.

998
01:07:48.041 --> 01:07:49.270
That is how important it is.

999
01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:54.130
I would say there's a lot of things where it's not worth the debt.

1000
01:07:54.131 --> 01:07:59.110
People want to do things,
things,
but things on your face,

1001
01:07:59.170 --> 01:08:03.640
face,
Brown faces worth debt.
Your face go into debt for your mouth.

1002
01:08:03.970 --> 01:08:08.830
Your mouth.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's so important.

1003
01:08:09.370 --> 01:08:12.790
It's so important.
How did she smile?
You know,
when I got my,

1004
01:08:12.890 --> 01:08:17.540
my veneers done this time around,
the guy did them,
was this amazing craftsmen.

1005
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:19.340
Yeah,
and he said that people,

1006
01:08:19.341 --> 01:08:23.020
people don't smile for years when they have jacked up teeth.

1007
01:08:23.690 --> 01:08:26.210
Could you imagine not smiling because you're ashamed of your team?

1008
01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:27.200
Clearly she's not,

1009
01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:31.670
but other people you know and your muscles and your lips and everything change

1010
01:08:31.671 --> 01:08:32.504
over time.

1011
01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:35.990
He said that he'd get it takes a while to get used to smiling when you get new

1012
01:08:35.991 --> 01:08:40.400
teeth.
I made,
made me almost cry hearing that like that.

1013
01:08:40.401 --> 01:08:45.320
People don't smile because of their teeth.
Yeah,
no,
it sucks.

1014
01:08:45.321 --> 01:08:46.154
It sucks.

1015
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.620
I feel like that woman and this guy would be actually a great match.

1016
01:08:51.650 --> 01:08:52.610
I'm going to show you.

1017
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:57.620
<v 16>Yeah.
Cairo sage or I wasn't looking for trouble on the light rail that night.</v>

1018
01:08:57.621 --> 01:09:00.530
The trouble certainly found him and when that fight broke out,

1019
01:09:00.531 --> 01:09:02.960
he was ready for it.
With his trusty Katana,

1020
01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.940
the fight had been going on for about 20 minutes.

1021
01:09:10.510 --> 01:09:14.840
She was two on one and none of them saw Cairo stage zero move around behind
them.

1022
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:17.390
To them,
they probably thought I was just moving out in a way,

1023
01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:20.150
but I was actually setting up to where their blind spot was.

1024
01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:22.000
The sad truth is is that they weren't even

1025
01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.700
<v 7>just to pull out a sword.
Keto said you'd all</v>

1026
01:09:26.790 --> 01:09:29.180
<v 16>challenge.
This is about what you saw on the train.</v>

1027
01:09:29.210 --> 01:09:31.400
It's folded tempered and it does its job.

1028
01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:38.790
Oh,
it says the three men on the train are lucky they ran because I already had a

1029
01:09:38.791 --> 01:09:41.920
full,
a full five stage plan ready to take her

1030
01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:45.360
<v 7>a five state.
Looking at,
I love this at the brim of the hat.</v>

1031
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:49.320
He's out of his fucking mind guy is completely crazy.

1032
01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:53.520
Those guys in New York City in the 80s the angels where they called and they

1033
01:09:53.521 --> 01:09:56.370
would,
they would fight crime on fucking subways and shit.

1034
01:09:56.910 --> 01:10:01.590
What would they call that?
The blue angels.
Come on,
man.
Pilots.
I know.

1035
01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:03.690
I gotta look it up.
It's killing me.

1036
01:10:03.691 --> 01:10:07.110
There's a group of nerds in the 80s and they would be on subways and they'd see

1037
01:10:07.111 --> 01:10:10.470
stuff happen and they would fight crime.
That's what this guy does.

1038
01:10:11.730 --> 01:10:15.720
This guy though,
there's a lot of fucking basement time in this guy.
Of course.

1039
01:10:15.721 --> 01:10:19.530
He's a nerd.
We'll,
we'll let,
okay,
let's let her talk

1040
01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:22.610
<v 16>out and anybody else who got involved just in case.</v>

1041
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:24.230
That's just the way I do things.

1042
01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:28.400
There's a little poll sending between him and there and there's him,
him,
him.

1043
01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.840
If he had gone on me,
I was planning to go in,

1044
01:10:32.841 --> 01:10:37.841
completely brought the sword down and then completely cut it out completely gay

1045
01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.890
cape.
I'm open because my family couldn't handle me.

1046
01:10:39.891 --> 01:10:43.120
I had a surprisingly strange affinity.

1047
01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:46.970
My family couldn't handle crazy sharp objects,

1048
01:10:46.971 --> 01:10:48.980
particularly kitchen knives when I was a kid,

1049
01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:52.660
so we traded in the knives from lifetime of studying.
The sword,
the Kitano,

1050
01:10:52.661 --> 01:10:53.690
it goes with him everywhere.

1051
01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:58.220
Actually carry this because I become a little bit more dangerous than without it

1052
01:10:58.221 --> 01:11:01.370
than with it,
so it's more of a restraint mechanism.
Been a safety blanket.

1053
01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:07.680
<v 7>I love this guy.
He just said then he's more dangerous without it.</v>

1054
01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:09.670
It's a restraint.
Yeah.

1055
01:11:10.150 --> 01:11:14.040
It's keeping him from being as dangerous as he truly

1056
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:17.220
<v 5>is mind,
but let's be honest,
not it's all in his mind.
Of course.</v>

1057
01:11:17.221 --> 01:11:21.690
In his mind it's mine.
He's a superhero dude.
I love it.

1058
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:26.820
Yeah,
he's put,
could you see him dating that older lady?
Yes.

1059
01:11:26.821 --> 01:11:30.480
That's the kind of guy that makes sense with like a nice do gooder a crime

1060
01:11:30.481 --> 01:11:34.710
fighter.
Please remind me what is the thing that I'm thinking of?

1061
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:39.480
It's not the blue angels.
What are you looking for?
What?
What?

1062
01:11:39.710 --> 01:11:41.970
He's these group of nerds and they weren't,

1063
01:11:41.971 --> 01:11:46.530
they would wear uniforms and they blegh police New York City.
Okay.

1064
01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:50.010
The red,
the blue angels,
something like that.

1065
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:53.990
<v 7>Fuck.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
My man,
you're too young.</v>

1066
01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:56.190
The Guardian Angel,

1067
01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:02.750
<v 5>Guardian Angels.
That guy needs to be a guardian angel.
I think he is.
Yeah,
he is.</v>

1068
01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:07.530
I love him.
He's a sword wielding guardian angels.
He just watches too many,
um,

1069
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:11.460
Japan animation shows and then he thinks he's like a Japan summation character.

1070
01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:14.820
Really does think he has digital auntie.

1071
01:12:14.821 --> 01:12:17.850
I love me some vigilantism wait,
do you think those,

1072
01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:20.060
it played the footage of the black guys freaking out?

1073
01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:24.530
<v 7>No,
not really.
You know how black people freak out?</v>

1074
01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:25.860
How do they do it?

1075
01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:32.810
Mr. Sword?
He got a sword.
They don't do that.

1076
01:12:35.450 --> 01:12:38.870
I don't think it would be so composed.
I think that

1077
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:43.460
that's probably more accurate or black

1078
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:49.410
do it.

1079
01:12:52.490 --> 01:12:55.630
I don't think it would be like that.
I don't think so.
How would they do it?

1080
01:12:55.631 --> 01:12:58.520
How are those black guys say?
Some shit.
If they saw a white kid with a story,

1081
01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:02.000
I think,
oh shit is exactly what,
what happened?
Yeah.
I think they would.

1082
01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:03.430
It would be like fighting.
We were like,

1083
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:08.420
Shit like that and then he's run out yet Nancy.
Okay.

1084
01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:15.530
That sounds like that's people watching a clip.

1085
01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:22.670
People on the train right here.
Right.
That's a spectator,
not the actual

1086
01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:24.770
shit.

1087
01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:29.660
Your pants if you're in a fight and then the guy goes out fucking sword.

1088
01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:34.610
Yeah.
Oh Man.
Why don't you that guy?
Cause even in his recap to the newspeople,

1089
01:13:34.730 --> 01:13:38.130
he was like,
and I was going to go like this and then slice them open like that.

1090
01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:39.350
Do was ready to kill people.

1091
01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:43.460
<v 5>Hey,
hey.
Number one.
Good for,
I love it.
I mean look,</v>

1092
01:13:43.461 --> 01:13:46.490
I fucking seen people fighting and shit in public school.

1093
01:13:46.491 --> 01:13:51.140
There's nothing scarier than a dog pile of people just punching each other.

1094
01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:53.410
Good.
Yes.

1095
01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:56.750
What a fuck was the sword guy when I was getting my ass kicked in junior high?

1096
01:13:57.050 --> 01:14:00.640
<v 7>What I want to know.
Go ahead.
Good.</v>

1097
01:14:01.150 --> 01:14:05.440
We need more guys like him.
Vigilantes,
good guardian angels like taxi driver.

1098
01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:08.830
Good.
Tremendous boxer.

1099
01:14:08.831 --> 01:14:12.430
Amir Khan who actually he at recently.
I think

1100
01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:15.160
<v 3>I could pull this up.
Is it sugar cones,
cousin</v>

1101
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:22.540
man,
I was,
again,
this is for me.
Just for me.

1102
01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:27.150
That was really,
that was rough.

1103
01:14:35.050 --> 01:14:39.610
Here's American.
Um,
crazy.
Alex.

1104
01:14:39.611 --> 01:14:44.260
Why the fuck make that smaller?
Oh really?
Yeah.
If you want drag.
Okay.

1105
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:49.440
Oh Shit.
This mother fucker got a sword.
Here's Amir Khan.
Recently,

1106
01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:53.540
right here.
What crazy looks like.
Shut up.
Yeah.
So crazy.

1107
01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:57.120
Looks at his gym and Amir Khan's,
everybody.
Tremendous boxer.

1108
01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:04.350
Look how,
how's how excited.
So Amir things,

1109
01:15:04.351 --> 01:15:08.160
everything is cool and then you can see it.
He's slowly looks at crazy legs like

1110
01:15:09.370 --> 01:15:10.203
<v 2>bullshit.</v>

1111
01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:23.010
Bullshit.
God bless everybody at this gym.
Coach Tony.
Oh,

1112
01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:24.940
Steven.
Hey,
bye.

1113
01:15:28.530 --> 01:15:33.170
<v 3>Alright.
Okay Pal.
So here's a mirror.
Um,</v>

1114
01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:38.310
Shit.
Trying to be an older fight,
but this is him.
Uh,

1115
01:15:38.490 --> 01:15:41.760
in the ring it looks like maybe you're like right after a fight had ended.

1116
01:15:42.010 --> 01:15:42.880
Caitlin says,
yes,

1117
01:15:43.390 --> 01:15:46.330
<v 17>your wife's,
but goodness me.
How hard did you have to work to earn that?</v>

1118
01:15:46.770 --> 01:15:49.570
Do you want me very hard?
This is the professional game.
No.
You know what I mean?

1119
01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:53.410
It's not gonna be easy.
First measure title.
I won't say he's my 13 fight.

1120
01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:56.800
I have to do it.
The army's wicked Willie,
the great fire now.
I mean,

1121
01:15:56.801 --> 01:16:00.220
you can't take no credit away from him because he was strong.

1122
01:16:00.230 --> 01:16:04.960
Just kept pulling forward.
Skillful.
Yeah.
I enjoy it.
I mean,
I love it in there.

1123
01:16:04.961 --> 01:16:08.080
Yeah.
I mean,
no matter if it had 12 rounds,
I was just loving every minute.

1124
01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:10.870
<v 3>So interesting to hear.
You know what I mean with that accident.
Right.
Well,</v>

1125
01:16:10.871 --> 01:16:13.890
I wasn't expecting that accent to come out of that face.
Oh yeah,

1126
01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:16.180
that's the last accident I would have expected.

1127
01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:19.310
What did you expect from Americans?
Just like American.
Oh really?

1128
01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:23.180
It's just like shocker con's cause

1129
01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:27.010
<v 17>we're getting over anxious by accident.</v>

1130
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:32.490
I went to the brink though the went to the brink.
At one stage.

1131
01:16:32.491 --> 01:16:36.930
It looks you're gonna lose that fight.
Never,
never,
never money went down.
No.
You,

1132
01:16:36.931 --> 01:16:39.870
I mean that's Bob too for you.
I mean,
one change.
It could have changed my boy

1133
01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:45.270
and I can come up for me from what was going on.
You,
I mean,
when I,

1134
01:16:45.370 --> 01:16:46.203
when I did get on me,

1135
01:16:46.210 --> 01:16:49.060
<v 3>this might be a record setting.
Oh,
Maine.
Uh,</v>

1136
01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:54.040
find as far as as they go.
I didn't know this and this crosses genre.
I mean,

1137
01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:58.870
you've got,
oh,
a white guy who was a boxer and he's saying,
you know,

1138
01:16:58.871 --> 01:17:02.220
and he's not a white guy.
What are you talking about?
Yeah.
About,
well,
what is he,

1139
01:17:02.221 --> 01:17:07.200
Tom?
That guy looks like a white guy to,
you know,
are you serious right now?

1140
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:10.070
I didn't want to guess because the million

1141
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:14.930
<v 7>songs will be made and clips.
We'll be isolated.
Well,
I mean,</v>

1142
01:17:16.050 --> 01:17:21.020
what part of Amir Khan's look,
it says white guy.
I don't know.

1143
01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:23.130
I mean,
what is he then Tom

1144
01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:29.660
and I guess he is a Pakistani descent.

1145
01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:33.280
Oh yes.
Yeah.
Okay.
So,
uh,
yeah,

1146
01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:35.220
but he's obviously British raise,
right?
Yeah.

1147
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:41.840
But why don't you do the master of accents,
aren't you then?
Is He British?

1148
01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:46.070
Yeah,
he's a born in which region do you hear though?
I here.

1149
01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:50.420
I had mentioned to Manchester,
Manchester,

1150
01:17:50.421 --> 01:17:54.830

You know what I mean?
You know what I mean?

1152
01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:04.280
You know what I mean?
So I did it perfect.
That was perfect.
Yummy,
Yummy,

1153
01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:07.820
Yummy,
Yummy,
Yummy Manchester.

1154
01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:11.840
<v 17>I mean,
he will put you on the show me,
but I judge component my cell phone.</v>

1155
01:18:11.841 --> 01:18:16.760
Just pick the right shots.
Shots.
I like it.
A lot of mistakes when you

1156
01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:22.050
go right for you out.
I think the timing just wasn't there,
you know?
I mean,
I,

1157
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:25.150
the timing just wasn't there,
you know what I mean?
But anxious,
anxious,

1158
01:18:25.151 --> 01:18:26.870
his white to commit myself to much,
you know,
I mean,

1159
01:18:27.210 --> 01:18:28.700
wine just jumped them working myself.

1160
01:18:30.850 --> 01:18:35.150
<v 7>Buying is mash,
you know what I mean?
You know what I mean?
Do your deer.</v>

1161
01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:38.050
It's a bit of a wiffle.
There's a Babel,
wherefore Edon it

1162
01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.250
should I checked

1163
01:18:42.210 --> 01:18:45.820
<v 17>penny,
you want me?</v>

1164
01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:49.110
You know what I mean?
For me,
I mean,
do you want me to you?
I mean tell me and go.

1165
01:18:49.111 --> 01:18:51.230
I mean,
do you want me to,
you know what I mean?
Definitely.
Definitely.

1166
01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:01.850
<v 7>I think because in your world they're all different.
He might've,</v>

1167
01:19:02.410 --> 01:19:06.700
Amir has risen to the top as far as you know,
what I means,
he's the king of,

1168
01:19:06.701 --> 01:19:10.240
you know what I mean?
This guy has set the bar super high,
super high.

1169
01:19:10.241 --> 01:19:15.220
It's going to really take a strong opponent the same way it does in the ring to

1170
01:19:15.230 --> 01:19:18.730
dethrone.
Amir Khan from the,
you know what I mean?
Title,

1171
01:19:19.210 --> 01:19:23.770
this White Guy,
Amir Khan,
this title and he's Pakistani,

1172
01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:27.520
which is unique.
I don't think we've ever had a Pakistani,
you know what I mean?

1173
01:19:28.510 --> 01:19:30.880
He's number one.
He's number one through 10 on,
you know what I mean?

1174
01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:35.890
For Pakistani people,
we've never had that.
Absolutely.
Generally same.

1175
01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:39.550
Yeah.
Not,
not a lot of writing.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
Well,

1176
01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:44.460
you know what I mean?
You know what I mean?
You know what I mean?
Shit.

1177
01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:48.730
Okay.
All right.
We're going to roll out anything you want to do.
Be Good.

1178
01:19:49.330 --> 01:19:53.320
Get straight.
Is that going to play at the beginning?

1179
01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:55.450
The one that you had loaded for the US?
Totally different.

1180
01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:59.920
Keep pushy in training,

1181
01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:05.590
but it's in the drops.
Oh,

1182
01:20:06.250 --> 01:20:10.160
so it's in an email.
Okay.
And then the crazy lugs,
Kate,

1183
01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:15.170
push in from those [inaudible] to the rapid training.

1184
01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:20.670
That's it.
Kate.
Better that way.
Yeah.
That's a better song.

1185
01:20:20.730 --> 01:20:25.440
Wrapping.
Okay.
Kate,
anything else?
Jeans?
No,
I love you.

1186
01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:29.160
How am I happy SMURF Day.
I'm glad that you lived 37 years.
Yeah.

1187
01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:34.520
You don't look a day over 47 I hope you live at least five more.

1188
01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:38.760
No,
I hope you live along.
The child is crying.

1189
01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:41.010
I know he's probably getting ready for her to get out of the crate.

1190
01:20:41.011 --> 01:20:44.650
You can't just leave him in there for this whole show.
All right,
we got to run.

1191
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:47.660
Thanks for listening to the show.
Amaze.
Keep pushing you.

1192
01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:52.100
I'll see you in spoke Compton spokes from can spur him.
Can I buy my jeans?

1193
01:20:55.890 --> 01:20:56.723
<v 14>Oh,</v>

1194
01:21:02.510 --> 01:21:03.343
hello.

1195
01:21:05.190 --> 01:21:10.190
<v 9>Eh?
Anybody playing or watching the afternoon TV show?</v>

1196
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:16.120
I had it scored or in bed and got on me.
The band and Brett

1197
01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:21.740
came black.
No,
I got him on the bedspread and I had to wash the best way.

1198
01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:24.980
You know,
wasn't done body.

1199
01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:33.240
<v 14>Oh,
oh,</v>

1200
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:35.720

1201

<v 9>ready?</v>

1202
01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:50.440
<v 7>Okay.</v>
