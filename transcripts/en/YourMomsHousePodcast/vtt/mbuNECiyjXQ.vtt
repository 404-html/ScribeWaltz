I think they need to do it for about six,
seven hours.

8
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.610
They're leaf blowing duties.
Those are illegals.

Walk me through your process.

63
00:04:54.681 --> 00:04:58.800
Can we do the ads first?
And I thought I was just getting into the shower.

00:05:55.341 --> 00:05:58.190

<v 1>Don't bring in one month into this
role.</v>

80
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.360
Go to your mom's house.

81
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.453
Christina.

82
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:53.743
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

83
00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.140
<v 0>Uh,
Hi Hitler.</v>

84
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.510
I love Rachel Maddow.
You love her,
don't you Rachel?
Yeah,
I dunno.
You do.

85
00:07:07.511 --> 00:07:11.690
I thought you really liked Rachel.
Um,
no.
Susie Orman.
You like Suzy?
Oh,

86
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.580
she's your girl.
Yeah,
the finance lady.
Yeah.

87
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.100
I thought you really liked Rachel too,
right?
I mean,
I wouldn't,

88
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.670
I feel weird saying it's not that I dislike her,
I just never considered it.
Like,

89
00:07:21.671 --> 00:07:25.000
Hey,
you know,
I really like,
yeah,
I thought you had a thing.
Oh,
that's Christiana.

90
00:07:25.001 --> 00:07:28.930
I'm,
I'm,
I'm uh,
yeah,
like Christone one,
four.
Yeah.
She's a journalist though,

91
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.430
or her butthole.
I'd never really thought of Miss Ammann pour that way.

92
00:07:33.431 --> 00:07:35.910
I'm sorry that my wife disrespected you with that question.
Uh,

93
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.180
I consider her a a fine journalist.
Yeah,
she's really good.
Yeah.

94
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:45.310
Uh,
Rachel's really good at her job,
but she's more like a,
you know,

95
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.880
news sort of evolved or devolved into the business of entertainment and opinion.

96
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.130
Yeah.
So she's really great at what she does,
but she's,
you know,

97
00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.550
she's a mouthpiece for the left,
which is fine.
I mean,

98
00:08:00.551 --> 00:08:05.380
I enjoy what she does.
She's,
she's,
no,
it's just what her job is.

99
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:10.150
You don't have job is that,
and obviously her job is to listen to podcasts.
Well,

100
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.170
clearly she's biting,
you know,
from the show.
Yeah.
She's and I,

101
00:08:15.171 --> 00:08:20.170
and I look in that respect.
I respect that she's doing it.
She's,

102
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.370
well,
she's a Dany Houck first hardcore Dana.
Yeah.

103
00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:28.990
She a duty or your mom's house fan?
I'm not sure.
Oh,
that's interesting.
Yeah,

104
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.510
I mean it could be,
it could be either one.
I guess.

105
00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:35.350
I never really so great that this woman has total white pride.

106
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.150
Coot does Hitler.
Yeah.
Yeah.

107
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:44.810
Well what state is this and that that's totally acceptable to go to work with?

108
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:50.050
She's doing and the scope.
What are the age signified,
by the way?

109
00:08:50.051 --> 00:08:54.190
I didn't really know that.
I just know h,
h,
h.
H,

110
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:59.880
letter H.
Okay.
The eighth letter in the alphabet is h,
is that a,
B,
c,

111
00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:03.930
d,
e,
f.
G.
H.
So Eight,
eight,
eight,

112
00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:09.340
eight j you know the thing I don't think she realizes is that he is not going to

113
00:09:10.201 --> 00:09:15.000
respond.
The tattoos,
Hitler's strict watches.

114
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.400
He likes blogs.

115
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.000
You got to record a video and you talked to him that way.

116
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.680
If you do a tattoo or what?
He totally misses.

117
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.850
Well because in Argentina has wifi connection's really,
really good,

118
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:33.810
but he's still underground so he can only has got funneled through all these

119
00:09:33.811 --> 00:09:38.670
things.
Right.
So if you want to got a busy day,
busy,
busy,

120
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.930
just like Winston Churchill,

121
00:09:39.931 --> 00:09:44.880
he lays in bed and he does most of his work from bed.
My Mans got shit to do.
So

122
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.330
he's got a lot of logs,
dancer.
So there's a,

123
00:09:49.331 --> 00:09:51.720
there's a way to get in touch with them.
And right now you're kind of,

124
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:55.830
you're missing stuff.
I'm a huge Rachel Maddow fan.
Right shot.

125
00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.833
I know.

126

Thank you for noticing.

128
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.800
uh,
a Trump thing that we were watching was there.
That's what,

129
00:10:16.801 --> 00:10:20.710

136
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.100

137
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.040
Who Do I feel like I feel like to Wanda?

138

142
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.570
Oh Great.
That's where I'm fine on linkedin.

143
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.660
My Dad invited us to join linkedin this week.
He did.

144
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.500
He's actually invited us to join linkedin.

145
00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.670
So when you know in like the 69 year old set is inviting you to join,

146
00:11:34.671 --> 00:11:38.300
linkedin has jumped the shark completely jumped.
Speak for yourself.

147
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:43.630
Those of us that are,
that are really in on the inside,
we know that it's,

148
00:11:43.631 --> 00:11:44.510
it's a very,

149
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:49.340
very relevant like to be a part of Dennis helpful.

150
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:54.190
Yeah.
It's not a joke.

151
00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.290
<v 2>Play it again.
I love it.
It's a bit that I'm doing.</v>

152
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.720
Linkedin is helpful.
I don't need the help.

153
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:07.203
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

154
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.960
<v 2>I fucking dog assholes.</v>

155
00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:14.653
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

156
00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:20.570
<v 2>Yeah.
Linkedin is helpful off.
You know,
Linkedin is helpful.</v>

157
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.980
Yeah,
it is.
I take that challenge.

158
00:12:24.981 --> 00:12:27.350
I wonder is anybody actually using linkedin?

159
00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:31.530
Email us if you've actually found it to be helpful.
Do you think people religion,

160
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:35.860
can I step in?
Don't do that.
Oh,
okay.
We just don't want to know about your,

161
00:12:35.861 --> 00:12:39.090
like the dead Linkedin is all,
I'm curious,
are you really,

162
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.070
I wonder if anyone really,
apparently people invite you to use it,

163
00:12:43.071 --> 00:12:47.240
but has anybody really using it or not only that,
but is there really a benefit?

164
00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:48.470
That's what I'm saying.
No.

165
00:12:48.471 --> 00:12:53.471
I'm saying like what I'm saying is let's say someone does,

166
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.900
you know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?
And you go,
okay,
then what?

167
00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:00.860
That's what I mean,
what's the utility?
Why not just make it Facebook?

168
00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:05.780
And you know what I'm saying?
It's a smarter right now.
First of all,

169
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.700
we had a lot happened before we started recording today.
Yeah.
Yeah.

170
00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:13.170
You used the name Dennis helpful.
Yeah.
You use the big day.
True.

171
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:17.960
But you didn't make a brown.
Right?
So what's going on here?
Exactly.

172
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.220
Well,
I mean

173
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:25.650
<v 5>I browned earlier and it was fine.</v>

174
00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:30.450
Fine.
Yeah.
And,
um,
and then we just kinda hung out.

175
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.790
I didn't shower before the show,

176
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:38.130
so I just went in there like a second time for just like a cursory kind of,

177
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.890
make sure you know,
just to feel fresh.

178
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:44.440
<v 2>But,
but so you weren't feeling fresh and then you thought,
okay,</v>

179
00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.750
<v 5>little,
you know,</v>

180
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.940
little gaming [inaudible] I just took a little,
you know,

181
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.343
French bath.

182
00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:57.560
<v 2>Yeah.
It's like a horse horseback.
Yeah.
Can I tell you that this bid day?
Yes.</v>

183
00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:02.090
Paid off so much.
It has saved me so many shit to shower trips.

184
00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.610
I don't even shed the shower anymore.
Yeah,
it is.

185
00:14:04.611 --> 00:14:09.320
Put a stop to that whole problem.
Yeah,
it's been pretty great.
Right?
Oh my God.

186
00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.000
Oh my goodness,

187
00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:16.100
<v 5>man.
Um,
Ooh.
What was that?
That was,
uh,</v>

188
00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:21.230
my Skype.
I was actually going to tell you that.
Um,
well,
you know,

189
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:22.423
I um,

190
00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.730
<v 2>I had a bit of an accident this weekend.
I know I didn't want to,
you know,</v>

191
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.050
all right.
At the top of the showtime.
Oh,

192
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:35.210
you wanted to hold onto all your load already.
Hey,
let's,
let's,
let's go over it.

193
00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:40.220
I think it's a pretty noteworthy.
It was,
what was it,
Friday or Saturday?

194
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.780
It all blends together.
It doesn't,
it is all blending Saturday.
It was Saturday.

195
00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.610
Yeah.
Saturday

196
00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:49.573
<v 6>I think</v>

197
00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.173
<v 0>we waited,
we went in the,</v>

198
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:56.000
and we were having breakfast this morning and I s I started,

199
00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.820
I laughed about the fact that I had farted and uh,

200
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:05.830
I like farting in the bedroom when you're sleeping and when you wake up and

201
00:15:07.071 --> 00:15:11.110
you're upset that you woke up from afar.
It's upsetting to me cause I don't,

202
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.160
that's not the alarm clock of my shoes.

203
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:17.510
Cause sometimes you'll go like you'll be out and you'll go great.

204
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.070
I was asleep and you know,

205
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.600
I just woke up to your fart and you're like really upset about it.
Yeah.

206
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:28.700
What woman wants to be awakened by a fart?
Some cool tricks to,
yeah,

207
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.490
there's no checks that like that somewhere down with it.

208
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:36.740
So I wasn't next to you cause I was in baby Jane's room and I went to go take a

209
00:15:36.741 --> 00:15:39.520
dump in the kitchen and the kitchen bathroom down there.
Right.

210
00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.200
And as I'm in there,
I'm just enjoying my time.

211
00:15:42.201 --> 00:15:45.560
I'm thinking I can really relax into this dot because I was watching the baby

212
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:49.040
once.
I can take a leisurely shit.
Yup.
And Lo and behold,

213
00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:52.070
that gets ruined because what happens is,

214
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:56.930
as I'm thinking about the fact that I want you to hear a Fart,
if I let it,

215
00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:00.830
I'm not really paying attention.
So when I feel something in the chamber,

216
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:06.080
I just go aggressive.
And when I push your bottom lamp,
what he did,

217
00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.610
I'm sitting on that stool,
there's a bar stool in the kitchen and

218
00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:18.080
I'm sitting there and I go,
oh.
And then I just feel there's no noise.

219
00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.820
I just feel water coming in and I go,

220
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.110
I just charted and you go,
no you didn't.

221
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.490
And then I reached down to touch cause I'm like maybe.
Yeah,
yeah.

222
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:31.100
And it was just all wet,
all wet.
And I go upstairs,

223
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:35.810
it's just soaked from the sun.
I had to wait,
by the way,
I sat in my,

224
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:40.370
in my pig stew for awhile because I had to wait for you to come out so the baby

225
00:16:40.371 --> 00:16:44.630
wouldn't be alone.
Yeah.
Cause I was shitty.
I was in the middle of,
I know.
I know.

226
00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.620
80 years old.
I don't know how to hold in a fart.
I know.
Well,
I didn't start that.

227
00:16:51.621 --> 00:16:55.550
I don't know how to hold in a fart.
I chose to let her rip,
you know,

228
00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:57.230
pushed too hard.
Oh yeah.

229
00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:02.260
Can I tell you what I think your fatal flaw was the wooden stool because that's

230
00:17:02.601 --> 00:17:04.560
a flat surface.
No,

231
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.770
you were sitting on a fatal flaw is that I had,

232
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:14.150
I didn't have a Fart in the chamber.
I had a dump.
A loose like a six.

233
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.380
A loose meat.
Yeah.
I didn't realize what it was when I sat on that toilet.
It was,

234
00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:22.070
it was bombs away.
It was.
Now let me ask you this.

235
00:17:22.071 --> 00:17:25.100
Let's do an autopsy of your brown shirt.

236
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:28.520
You didn't feel any indication of a six.

237
00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:32.280
You didn't feel any cramping or diarrhea imminent.
Now,

238
00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:37.190
sometimes I have a real explosive shit to start the day depending on,

239
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:41.060
depending on the day and what goes in.
And sometimes I don't.

240
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.360
But in this case it was like I woke up,

241
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:49.290
I had some coffee and then had some,
it was scrambled eggs with veggies,

242
00:17:49.291 --> 00:17:50.190
but that doesn't make

243
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:55.140
<v 5>it,
that formula doesn't mean it's definitely going to be loose meat sandwich.</v>

244
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:56.430
It could be fine.

245
00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:01.180
It's just one of those things where that day it was just horrendous.
No,

246
00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:05.310
and I think it was,
I think it was God punishing you for,

247
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:09.390
for wanting me to hear your heart.
That's what you told me.
Yeah.
I got it.

248
00:18:09.391 --> 00:18:13.140
Finished.
You.
Hmm?
He's a vengeful God.
Old Testament.

249
00:18:13.141 --> 00:18:15.720
God gets back at you for that kind of stuff.

250
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:18.600
Let's see if we can get top out it on the phone to discuss this.

251
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.690
I don't know if he'll answer.
I didn't him.
I be calling [inaudible].

252
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:27.690
Hello?
Hello Buddy.
I invited you to join late.

253
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:30.970
Hello.
Hi.

254
00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:39.820
<v 8>Hello.
Hey Dad.
Hey Buddy.
Hey.</v>

255
00:18:39.821 --> 00:18:42.300
How's it going man?
Good.

256
00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.950
<v 5>Hey.
Um,
so I don't know,
I didn't really get a chance to talk to you,</v>

257
00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:50.960
but Saturday morning I was sitting in our kitchen and we're having a little

258
00:18:50.961 --> 00:18:55.961
breakfast and actually Christina went to use the bathroom and while I was in the

259
00:18:56.571 --> 00:19:00.620
kitchen I went to fart and it was just all water that came out of me.

260
00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.860
<v 8>Oh Shit.
That happened to me.
That nine bed in bed?</v>

261
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:11.340
Yeah.
Didn't I tell,
you know?
Oh I had a,

262
00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.190
I had a squirter in bed and got on the uh,
the bedspread.

263
00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:20.460
Wait and I had to,
Oh yeah.
Okay.
Wait a minute.

264
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:24.780
Were you in bed,
like going ready to go to sleep?
No,

265
00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:28.230
just laying there watching it in an afternoon TV show.
Cause you know,

266
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:33.030
what were you wearing?
When I had my boxers when I was kind of a weird position,

267
00:19:33.031 --> 00:19:36.810
so my boxers,
you know,
and we're kind of open.
Okay.

268
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:39.360
Yeah,
no.
Yeah.

269
00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:44.850
And the kind of like some guy might unaware but some scored it.
Wait,
oh my God,

270
00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:46.800
there's like a,
like a spray

271
00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:54.500
primer stick flats on,
on the bedspread.

272
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:58.930
So I had to take the best it off,
put it in the Washington.
Wait,

273
00:19:59.000 --> 00:19:59.670
now how she,

274
00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:04.050
how come you didn't think it's just a little bit of shit cause one time you

275
00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:08.220
shortly.
Dot.
Just a miscalculation on my,
no wait,
did you,

276
00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:11.720
so you thought you were farther than you thought it'd just be a fart onsite as

277
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:16.110
partner for sure.
Did you,
did you push kind of aggressively?
No.
No.

278
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:20.660
That's what got me,
didn't make this guy to,
you know,
I mean I knew this.
Yeah.

279
00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:25.500
You kind of gave her that little last minute nudge,
you know?
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.

280
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:29.970
And how,
how much was it?
Cause it sounds like it sounds like a lot.

281
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.950
Well there's a lot more.
I didn't realize it.

282
00:20:31.951 --> 00:20:36.600
That would seem like a little hard at you.
Yeah.
I'm a lot more of their,
you know.

283
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.820
Yeah.
And this body,
you know,

284
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:43.050
wasn't tons over his body and after they had to change my underwear and change

285
00:20:43.051 --> 00:20:47.920
the whole bed.
Yeah.
So you had to go wash that bedspread,
the whole thing?

286
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.900
Yeah.
Yeah.
Did she did tell Charles?
Yeah.
Did you tell Charl what happened?

287
00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:57.540
I didn't feel it next day.
And then a ship,
mostly her don't,

288
00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:00.810
but the bedspread was doing it in the washing machine.
And I said,

289
00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.400
you told her what happened?
She said,
well,

290
00:21:02.401 --> 00:21:04.750
did you clean the spots before you put it in?

291
00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.740
Put it in there.
Oh,
it'll get all over everything.

292
00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.570
That's what the rinse cycle is.
How did you learn?

293
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.820
How did you tell her what happened?
Like what's the way you tell her that?

294
00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.340
Uh,
oh,
by the way,
I had a,

295
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:30.960
a little bit of a thought.
I was far and it kind of came blast you.

296
00:21:30.961 --> 00:21:33.740
And so I got it on the bed spread and I had to wash the best friend.

297
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.060
What did she think about?
Yeah.
Well,
you know,

298
00:21:37.061 --> 00:21:40.700
she doesn't really like to engage in these kinds of conversations.
Yeah.
Yeah.

299
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.490
You know,
I mean,

300
00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.730
didn't you tell me I got that you had one the other day.

301
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:52.780
You said that like it really curled up into the toilet or something.

302
00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:59.090
Well,
I had,
I had the,
uh,
well look like a snake the other day.
Yeah.
Yeah.

303
00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.630
That's interesting.
Yeah.
I mean,
it looked like a rattler with no rattler,

304
00:22:02.631 --> 00:22:06.410
you know?
Yeah.
Just kind of coiled up inside.
They had one of those,

305
00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:09.620
let me say what happened today.
I came back to the office,

306
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:16.100
had parked under a tree at a fart and then got out of the car,

307
00:22:17.391 --> 00:22:21.680
shut the door.
Andrea was off when I came back.
An hour and a half later,

308
00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.060
the smell was still in the car.
I couldn't believe it.
Awesome.

309
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:30.090
That is really when you think about it,
there's no,

310
00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:35.160
you know,
nothing.
Oh Eric can get in the car.
So he kinda,
he trapped.

311
00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.150
Yeah.
It was trips,
you know,
kind of settled in a little bit.
You know,

312
00:22:39.151 --> 00:22:41.880
it's like somebody smokes a cigarette,
the car,
just the door.

313
00:22:41.881 --> 00:22:44.990
You can tell me where smoking.
Okay.
I think you have more intense far,

314
00:22:44.991 --> 00:22:48.510
it's than most people know.
Oh,
I do.
Yeah,
I do.

315
00:22:48.511 --> 00:22:51.090
And I've modified my diet lately.
You know,
I've,

316
00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:54.000
I'm on this side eating fish everyday,

317
00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:58.920
can't tramp and orange roughy are trying to lose some weight and so I'm off to

318
00:22:58.921 --> 00:23:00.080
read meek.
Yeah.

319
00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:05.160
And of course that immediately immediately changed the texture.

320
00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.300
And,
uh,
and the smell of my four,
everything's changed.

321
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:12.720
I'm Kinda surprised honestly that you washed the,

322
00:23:12.721 --> 00:23:17.721
she only because you told me real clearly one time that you know when you

323
00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.850
started a little bit in your pants,
I said don't you want to put those down?

324
00:23:21.851 --> 00:23:24.420
And you said your quote was it's just a little bit of Shit.

325
00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:30.930
Where are you Margaret has to sleep on the bed.
There wouldn't,

326
00:23:30.931 --> 00:23:33.140
I mean I could if you were alone you wouldn't have watched it.

327
00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.680
I had it just sort of folded the bedspread over.
Covered it off

328
00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:42.740
this way nobody could tell.
Yeah.

329
00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.130
Cause you have also you have like

330
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.440
<v 0>the uh,
if you're going to work out,</v>

331
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:52.190
you have kind of that underwear policy where even if it has a little brown

332
00:23:52.191 --> 00:23:56.310
strict,
you can,
you can put them inside out.
Right?
Yeah.
Well I do that.
Yeah I did.

333
00:23:56.350 --> 00:24:00.340
Yeah.
Sure.
Do you think that's kind of gross?
Well No,

334
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:04.760
cause I'm an environmentalist.
I'm trying,
you know,
trying to save on water,

335
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:09.230
you know,
cause I saw chocolate stain on one and you just put them inside out.

336
00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:13.180
<v 8>That's true.
That's drive down to EPSCoR.
Yeah.</v>

337
00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:15.730
But I'm too lazy to just get it started.

338
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:19.030
You know when you go to the gym is going to get dirty and everything.

339
00:24:19.031 --> 00:24:20.500
So you just go all the way.

340
00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:24.210
<v 0>Do you know what level of barberry and you are for doing that?</v>

341
00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.000
Like that is really,
really horrendous to try.
No,

342
00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:29.640
no discharge.

343
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:34.780
<v 8>Do that.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.</v>

344
00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:37.070
There,
there are certain,
there are certain things,

345
00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:41.110
you know this business where you need to tell your wife,
you know,
we're in alive.

346
00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:45.560
We're going to share everything with each other.
Yeah.
Thanks guys.

347
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.660
Just don't want to share with women.

348
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:49.790
And it's not about other women when he tell Ya.

349
00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:51.860
<v 0>Yeah.
I mean,
I gotta say though,</v>

350
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:56.780
nothing excites me more than the possibility of mom hearing that story.

351
00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:02.200
Just to see her level of discuss would be hilarious.

352
00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:03.710
It would be amazing.

353
00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:09.520
<v 8>Really amazing.
I'll say Jackie said one time,
I don't know where I met you.</v>

354
00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:18.240
<v 0>That's hilarious man.
Um,
do you remember your,
uh,
your movie theater Fart?</v>

355
00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:19.910
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

356
00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:21.800
<v 8>Oh,
that was one of my proudest moments</v>

357
00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.420
<v 0>was that you think Amit related fart.</v>

358
00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:29.260
<v 8>You know,
I think it was just eating a lot of stuff.
Probably,</v>

359
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:34.270
I think it was a holiday fart because Ah,
yeah,
those are real.

360
00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:39.280
A lot of holiday food and in the people or if in the AMC theater people sit

361
00:25:40.431 --> 00:25:41.950
right behind me or let one go.

362
00:25:41.951 --> 00:25:46.380
I mean they picked up and moved five seats over.

363
00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:50.950
Yeah,
no kidding.
I'm not exaggerating.
I'm not exaggerating.

364
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:56.120
Yeah,
yeah.
That's a kind of gate kind of gave it that,
you know,

365
00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:59.140
a little notch in my belt.
Luck.
You know what I mean?

366
00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:03.670
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah.
It was really something we looked at.
Um,</v>

367
00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:07.880
I'll give you a call a little bit later.
Okay.
Okay Buddy.
You take care.
Bye Bye.

368
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:12.220
Bye Bye.
Wow.
Wow Dude.

369
00:26:12.221 --> 00:26:15.550
He would have folded over the mattress cover.

370
00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.580
Is that what you to do the right thing.

371
00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:21.990
<v 9>Hey Buddy.
Yeah,
it's top dog.
Hey Buddy.</v>

372
00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:27.050
Stop Dog
Kate Buddy.
Stop Dog.

373
00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:32.310
But do you need to wipe down?
Stop Dog.

374
00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:37.010
<v 0>Um,
wait.
So he would have folded over.
So just to be clear,</v>

375
00:26:37.011 --> 00:26:41.330
he shit on the bedspread.
Is that what he shut on?

376
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:44.250
I think it was a mattress cover the mattress cover

377
00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:47.270
<v 2>the comfort or maybe you know like that can come for I think something.</v>

378
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:51.710
It's a comforter he's referring to.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.

379
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:55.560
So he would have just folded it over.
If you were alone,
you were alone.

380
00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:01.220
<v 0>Is that most guys though?
Let's be real.</v>

381
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:05.930
Most guys sympathetically had no,
no,
no,
but it is.

382
00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:10.610
There is a certain type of savage.
I mean military,

383
00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.430
just like,
you know,

384
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:15.630
my dad would just probably eat out of the sink if he were alive,

385
00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:21.320
he'd over it and then just put the food bowl and he's a savage man.

386
00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.890
He's a savage.
You money,
doesn't know half of it.

387
00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.010
I'm sure she does though.
Yeah.

388
00:27:28.011 --> 00:27:33.000
But I think she voluntarily blocks a lot of things out.
You know,

389
00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:36.650
there's things that like when I'm with them I try to highlight his,

390
00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:41.510
his savagery to see her react.
She knows it's there,

391
00:27:41.511 --> 00:27:45.290
but she avoids it.
So when I keep pointing it out,
look,
look,
look,
look,
look.

392
00:27:45.291 --> 00:27:49.810
She was like,
ah,
no.
So disgusting.
Yeah.

393
00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:51.830
Isn't that interesting that my dad and I it

394
00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.560
<v 2>24 hours apart,
basically.
Very interesting.</v>

395
00:27:54.561 --> 00:27:58.700
And what's really neat too is that sometimes you'll go take a shit and our son

396
00:27:58.701 --> 00:28:02.790
will shit at the same time in his diaper.
I feel like that's the cigarette gene.

397
00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:07.490
It's the circle of Sigora life.
Yup.
Yeah.
That's really neat.

398
00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:11.780
And the earwax thing too,
it's pretty cool.
It's hereditary buddy.
Yeah.

399
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.710
I was pulling earwax out of our son's ear and I was telling you about it.

400
00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:20.020
<v 0>Yeah.
And then your dad was telling you that it's,</v>

401
00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.000
he's told me before on monetary cleaning,

402
00:28:22.001 --> 00:28:26.080
but you're only gonna have like a lot of wax that yes.
Hereditary.
We have that.

403
00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:31.030
I'm like,
fucking great.
What a cool thing to have in the gene pool.

404
00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.860
Right.
You know,
treat forearm strength,

405
00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:37.990
earwax pal.

406
00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:43.880
<v 2>Yeah.
A lot of that.
A lot of waxy years muddy.
And that's really exciting.</v>

407
00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:46.670
Oh my God.
It sounds,
it sounds like he's on track.
Yeah.

408
00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.370
Remember that time I saw your dad's balls

409
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:54.910
<v 0>yes.
On the cruise.
Yes.
And then he was just like,
Eh,</v>

410
00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:58.190
let's not make a big thing in this.
All right.
She's a grown lady,
like,

411
00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:01.080
are you going to cover up?
Come on said,
come on,

412
00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.200
<v 2>I'm really upset that you wanted to cover at this.</v>

413
00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.880
Now your balls to daughter-in-law.
Come on.

414
00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.240
So we went out to dinner with your sister Jane,

415
00:29:10.241 --> 00:29:15.150
who's in town and after dinner we were outside all ah,

416
00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:17.920
oh my God.
Oh my God.
Seriously.

417
00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:24.260
And um,
we were out front and I noticed a gaggle of dads.

418
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.880
Uh,
but these dad fashions were a little different.

419
00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:32.710
These guys had the Khakis and then the polo shirt and then they had their

420
00:29:32.711 --> 00:29:37.270
sweaters tied around their necks.
They were doing like the golf course thing,

421
00:29:37.271 --> 00:29:40.870
you know,
like what is that?
That's not really a west coast thing though.

422
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:42.820
It's like a,
why is this like this?

423
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:47.680
I didn't touch it really moved.
I didn't touch it.
I swear.

424
00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:50.910
It's a very,
like I,
it feels,
it's,

425
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:55.330
I think the origins are northeastern preppy.
It's the cat,

426
00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.150
the tucked in,

427
00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:02.350
buttoned down or the Polo and then the sweater over the shoulders.
Right.

428
00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:07.300
And kind of either tied or folded.
It's Super Gay.
It's super fucking.

429
00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:12.070
Yeah.
Dude,
that was a lame dad.
Boy City.
Yeah,
yeah,

430
00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:17.470
yeah.
It is a little afeminant now for a dad.
Look,
I,

431
00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:22.210
I think so.
Yeah.
I mean it's,
it's just,
it's supposed to be,

432
00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:25.240
I guess it's supposed to be money,
you know,

433
00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:30.790
like I'm a wealthy dad.
Yeah.
I'm a wealthy day and um,
uh,

434
00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:35.470
as president of the,
the dad's society here.
Yeah.

435
00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:38.980
Of Dad fashion fashion week.
Oh,

436
00:30:38.981 --> 00:30:41.410
that would be so fun if we had dad fashion week.

437
00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:45.700
It's then we can take dad's from all the different regions of America and have a

438
00:30:45.701 --> 00:30:49.480
fashion show.
Yeah.
And that'd be neat.
Oh yeah.
I mean it's,

439
00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:53.470
it's definitely,
it's Super Dad.
It's dad.

440
00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.430
It's dad to the Max because your dad loves his Khakis.

441
00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:01.070
Like on a Sunday he'll wear his khakis around the house in,

442
00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:05.010
that's his casual Sunday.
It is.
I don't like the sweater folded over with,
oh,

443
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.170
I don't like that.
Look at all like that instead of fag.

444
00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:12.550
You're not saying five boy.
Yeah.
Add,
isolate that.

445
00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:17.210
Thank you.
Yeah.
It's a PC version of faggot.
Okay.

446
00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:23.100
Thank you man.
Thank you.
Plaguing him turning purple.

447
00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:27.190
And he said it was my request.
Fucking trader blue.

448
00:31:27.191 --> 00:31:31.710
Then a sham.
You bird.
I look at a gee,
gee,

449
00:31:31.711 --> 00:31:35.200
why don't you tell him what happened?
I know I broke him today.
I broke him today.

450
00:31:35.201 --> 00:31:39.940
I,
I knocked this over,
but look,
here's the good news there.
Is that GG,

451
00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:40.803
hold on

452
00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:47.890
and then there's many GG.
All right.
Back in business,

453
00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.210
if you don't have a backup GGL and bobble head,
you better get your life.

454
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:55.530
If you're a real fan,
you have your primary and then your backup camera.

455
00:31:55.580 --> 00:32:00.250
You fucking did that.
You know what?
I can't say faggot.
I'm going to say fuck boy.

456
00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:01.683
Okay.

457
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:04.420
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

458
00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:07.490
<v 2>How do you isolate it?
Huh?
Three times you had to do it.</v>

459
00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:13.340
Had to catch me on that.
That's my favorite one.
Yeah.

460
00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:19.880
Thanks.
If I can say Faggot,
I got it.
Fuck boy.

461
00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.113
<v 7>Okay</v>

462
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:29.180
<v 2>guys,
my documentaries coming out.
Can we take a joke?</v>

463
00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:33.260
Lemonade release this summer,
Samuel Golden Mayer picked it up.

464
00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:36.080
I saw actually a lot of people talking about it online.

465
00:32:36.081 --> 00:32:40.220
Supposed to be really great.
I narrated it.
It's not my documentary.
[inaudible]

466
00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:42.710
<v 0>upon a story being,
if you're offended by that,</v>

467
00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:46.100
what you just heard me say about fuck boys,
don't go see that document.

468
00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:49.190
Fuckboy responses this week too.
Is that right?

469
00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.990
Oh,
they were like,
that's not a replacement

470
00:32:55.700 --> 00:33:00.270
for what Tom?
Uh,
a replacement.

471
00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:04.280
And if I can't say Faggot,
I'm going to say,
fuck boy.
Okay.
For what time?

472
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:09.920
I go like,
no,
it's not.
It's fucking stupid.
And of course it is.

473
00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.640
You guys are fucking fuck boys for saying that.

474
00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:18.170
It's 100% a plus.
What it sounds like it is,
I mean,

475
00:33:18.171 --> 00:33:22.400
the origin of Fuckboy is prison.
Okay.
Oh right.
Yeah.

476
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:27.500
And it's somebody who people would fuck there.
Hence it's a replacement.

477
00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:30.290
Yeah.
It's a buff guy.
You fuck,
it's not,

478
00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:34.720
it's not necessarily a replacement for the,

479
00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:39.710
the literal pejorative homosexual slang.

480
00:33:39.711 --> 00:33:44.420
What I'm saying is that it's replacing in the lexicon something that people want

481
00:33:44.421 --> 00:33:46.490
to angrily shout.
Right.

482
00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:50.960
With the intention being to take someone down,

483
00:33:50.961 --> 00:33:55.961
accused them of being lesser than whether that be a feminist or just a bitch.

484
00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:00.710
Right.
It's,
it's a,
it's a heightened version of bitch,

485
00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:05.530
but it's also something that you can yell freely basically.
Yeah.

486
00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.860
It's an acceptable form.
It totally is.

487
00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:11.330
And it will become politically incorrect and all you fuck boys the disagree or

488
00:34:11.331 --> 00:34:16.130
fuck boy.
Now what I did hear one of those dads doing in front of the restaurant.

489
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:19.690
Yeah.
As the dad throat clearing.
Uh,
yeah.

490
00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:25.880
And I had a Stepdad that did that for a years.

491
00:34:25.890 --> 00:34:29.510
I think a big fat Indian guy was pissed that dad and he would always do that

492
00:34:29.511 --> 00:34:31.550
after restaurants after meeting with your mom.

493
00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.570
My mother hated it cause he's in the morning too is like,

494
00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:43.670
it's so disgusting.
You hate and clearing cause I do it.
Um,

495
00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:48.970
I know that growing up my mom hates when I clear my yes.

496
00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:52.480
What does that,
I don't know.

497
00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:59.150
Oh I think it's the phone being too close to the thing.
All right.
Yeah,

498
00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:07.280
that sound is repulsive to me that I want to vomit when I hear that.
I see.
To me,

499
00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:10.950
I guess I understand it,
but you know,
I,
I,

500
00:35:10.951 --> 00:35:15.200
one time I left a lunch meeting where the guy producer,

501
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:19.840
we left the restaurant and on the sidewalk he went,
ha,

502
00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:25.610
any spit and a guy walking down the street when really I agree.

503
00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:29.450
He was like,
well no.
And I actually was,
you know,
it's one of those things,

504
00:35:29.451 --> 00:35:31.310
you leave a meeting like that with people.
You have to go like,

505
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:34.190
what's that guy's problem?
But I should have been like,
what is your problem?

506
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:38.460
Because gnarly,
gnarly.
It wasn't so neuro that he and I put it on the cement.

507
00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:42.720
<v 2>Like that's crazy.
That's fucked up,
dude.
He Chinese.
That's true.
That's true.</v>

508
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:45.990
I'm my Chinese ex boyfriend use talk about that all the time.

509
00:35:45.991 --> 00:35:49.590
How Chinese people do that.
Yeah.
He's like,
oh,
the Chinese are the worst.

510
00:35:49.591 --> 00:35:52.560
They just horrible.
Loogies everywhere.
And in places like Singapore,

511
00:35:52.561 --> 00:35:56.570
you're definitely not allowed to do that.
Yeah.
Um,

512
00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:02.040
wait,
why is that not isolated?
Like Tom Pushes the just,
I didn't do that.

513
00:36:02.041 --> 00:36:04.420
That's not,
that's you pushing the change on button.

514
00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.410
<v 5>Do anything.
I didn't do anything.</v>

515
00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:10.580
<v 2>Hey,
want to fuck with my mind,
so,
okay,
well,</v>

516
00:36:10.581 --> 00:36:13.920
Singapore just has laws,
period.
You don't fuck with anything.

517
00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.710
It's spit chewing gum on the ground.

518
00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:20.350
<v 5>No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
It's,
it's,
that's that,</v>

519
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:25.100
that place doesn't fuck around.
And they have,
um,
signs when you walk through,

520
00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:29.210
when you're waiting in line immigration,
you've been there signs that say,

521
00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:34.340
you know,
this,
this and that are punishable by death.
And then on the slip,

522
00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:38.590
the little immigration slip,
it says drug trafficking punishable by right

523
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:42.350
<v 2>death.
Hell yeah.
Big Red Letters.
Yeah,
dude,
don't as the Singapore.</v>

524
00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:45.650
And the crazy thing is,
people know that and they still will take that risk.

525
00:36:45.651 --> 00:36:47.330
And I know is I ran into

526
00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:52.060
<v 5>people,
I talk to me,
we'll actually listen to this show there that was,</v>

527
00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:55.070
you know,
bringing up the rules.
And they were like,
yeah.
You know,
some guy,

528
00:36:55.071 --> 00:36:56.810
they got a guy recently,

529
00:36:56.811 --> 00:37:01.560
he was in the news that in the bottom of a laptop he had packages of the week

530
00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:07.270
<v 2>and then they executed him.
Damn did.
And they can't help you if you're American.</v>

531
00:37:07.271 --> 00:37:10.420
Right.
And you fuck up like that.
If it's drugs,
you're done,
you're done.

532
00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:13.960
You know they got that,
that kid for a vandalism.
That's right.

533
00:37:13.961 --> 00:37:18.220
And they came in him and they negotiated less,
you know,

534
00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:22.350
less white paintings.
Yeah.
And that kid did graffiti,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

535
00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:26.380
Stupido tagged up some cars and stuff,
but oh my God.

536
00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:30.650
<v 5>The,
the truth is,
you know,
if you go,
if you</v>

537
00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:34.070
<v 2>bring drugs there,
you're just yes.
So dumps done just on,</v>

538
00:37:34.071 --> 00:37:37.490
don't travel abroad with drugs.
Don't even fuck with drones.
Oh Man.

539
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:42.260
God traveling with him is really crazy.
Yikes.
Yeah.
Crazy.
That's how you,
this,

540
00:37:42.261 --> 00:37:43.760
I knew this girl that used to travel with drug.

541
00:37:43.761 --> 00:37:47.240
She put them in her panties in the,
you know,
girls' panties.

542
00:37:47.241 --> 00:37:50.120
There's a thought or your COO dress.
Yeah.

543
00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.320
There's like a double layer of fabric and she'd put her drugs and that little

544
00:37:54.321 --> 00:37:59.270
pouch.
It's a good spot for it.
Uh,
uh,
Supreme Lee.
Good spot for it.
Yeah.
No,

545
00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:01.040
we're really not going to check your coach.
You know,

546
00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.740
I know a guy that told me he used to travel with it under his nuts.

547
00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:07.310
That's sub what's sub?
Apparently the crotch is the best area.
Yeah.

548
00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:11.260
But under your nuts.
Yeah.
You gotta make sure you've got big nuts that don't,

549
00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:15.860
you don't ever shrivel on you.
Right.
It's very important.
Yeah.

550
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:19.900
Big Old goat nuts.
Make your dad's got big nuts.
Big

551
00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:24.610
<v 5>Balls.
I know that a lot of you wanted to know about if there was,</v>

552
00:38:24.611 --> 00:38:29.300
um,
an update on the ass eating girl.
Um,

553
00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:31.810
oh yeah.
I was really thinking about her all week.

554
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:36.680
We played her last week and she gave her,
um,

555
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:41.760
<v 0>review of ass eating and in the end you could say that she said not that bad.</v>

556
00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:45.940
That's the best way to summarize it.
And she was sent to us so many times.

557
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:50.800
Your mom's house listeners really wanted us to see that shortly after we played

558
00:38:50.801 --> 00:38:53.910
her though her video went private.
Really?

559
00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:58.810
I think she was getting bombarded.
The mommy's attacked.

560
00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:02.290
I think just,
you know,
I think that that video might have just caught fire.

561
00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:06.580
So then she posted this about,

562
00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:11.760
I guess the re this is her posting since the gas heating video.

563
00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:13.353
Okay.

564
00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:18.560
<v 10>So recently I was featured on Youtube,
snapchat,</v>

565
00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:23.970
youtube snapshots,
Facebook page.
Not Shots.
MMM.

566
00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:29.920
Seeing video pretty okay.

567
00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:33.930
Pretty Mad.
Why?
Um,

568
00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:36.840
because now that in famous,

569
00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.920
I'm not getting the respect I deserve.
Um,

570
00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.190
and we need everybody to start

571
00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:49.620
treating me as you would treat.

572
00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:51.953
MMM.

573
00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:58.710
A famous person because I'm famous now.
And

574
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:04.680
<v 0>is she a great actress or is this real?
Because I was actually watching.</v>

575
00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:07.240
I was like,
this is actually really good acting right.

576
00:40:07.241 --> 00:40:11.440
Selling that or it's genuine.
Let's continue.
I'm not sure.

577
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:16.250
<v 10>Separate argument here when I say that because now that I'm saying this and then</v>

578
00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:21.260
if you are allowed to be mean to me and also in thickness now because I was on

579
00:40:24.041 --> 00:40:28.170
youtube,
snapchat,
snapshots and [inaudible].

580
00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:31.663
Hmm.

581
00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:40.140
I spoke to Macaulay Culkin this morning through prayer and he wants me to tell

582
00:40:42.341 --> 00:40:46.960
you to
hurry to him more often.

583
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:51.300
<v 0>It looks like she drank some other Dany Erica late.</v>

584
00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:55.850
Uh,
someone's off their meds

585
00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:04.730
to Colleen,
my colleague.
He's still alive.

586
00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:10.160
He's dead.
Finally.
He's not dead.
You should be paid.
Why?

587
00:41:10.161 --> 00:41:13.490
He does bad drugs.
He's on heroin.
Come on.

588
00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.970
I love Rachel Maddow.
Sub chipper

589
00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:21.260
this check,

590
00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:24.080
<v 10>because if you don't already</v>

591
00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:27.500
is her fucking deal brown.

592
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:32.510
You who are inside of a colleague Caulkin when you know that he's actually,

593
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.690
he's a fan of me because I'm famous now.

594
00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:43.700
Like I'm more famous than him and that's definitely not true as know that I'm

595
00:41:43.851 --> 00:41:48.851
offended by everything you do because you don't just cause I'm,

596
00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.830
what would it look like?
Sound pepper.
Holy Shit.

597
00:41:58.810 --> 00:41:59.950
<v 2>What do you think?
What's the verdict?</v>

598
00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:05.140
Well Macola Caulkins definitely more famous than ass eating girl on Youtube.

599
00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:10.120
Yeah.
Even if she was on youtube,
snap,
snap shots,
five shots,

600
00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.430
pop tarts,
stop jobs.
You know what?

601
00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:16.850
We should do a show this to our son when he's of the age of making videos,
right?

602
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:20.560
Yeah.
This is why you don't do,
you don't do this because stupid.

603
00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:25.270
We're going to humiliate you on this.
[inaudible] sure.
Yeah.
Still Book Kid.

604
00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:28.660
What do you think?
So I definitely think there's some danger,
Yak.
There's some,

605
00:42:28.661 --> 00:42:31.600
Danny had qualities to her.
That room,
I dunno.

606
00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:34.600
I don't think she's acting actually.
I think Senator [inaudible].

607
00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:42.320
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a lot.

608
00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:45.650
And that's a lot to handle.
Well,
she's famous now.

609
00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.280
I think it's funny that that is actually the thing that

610
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:54.370
<v 5>people in the general public are always not prepared for.</v>

611
00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:58.960
Um,
when something gets attention like a video,
right?
Cause like if you do,

612
00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:02.140
if you do comedy over time,

613
00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:04.180
as your profile grows,

614
00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:09.600
you build up a little bit and then it grows up a tolerance to people

615
00:43:10.391 --> 00:43:13.380
disrespecting you and treating you like shit.
Right.
Online.
Yeah.

616
00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:16.660
So after it happens a bunch,
you're like the Harris.
Yeah.
Yeah.

617
00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:20.800
But if you're just like a regular person and you post videos,
you don't,

618
00:43:20.801 --> 00:43:23.500
you don't normally get hate and then you have something that explodes,

619
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:26.040
like the aspect of it,
then you're like,
why are people

620
00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:30.460
<v 2>validity?
It's gotta be the most shocking to them,
you know?
Yeah.</v>

621
00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.190
Cause what did you think was going to happen?

622
00:43:32.191 --> 00:43:35.520
That people are like cool ass eating video.
We really like what you're doing.

623
00:43:35.521 --> 00:43:39.390
Yeah.
I got to ask.
You can eat.
Yeah,
it's good.
It's all,

624
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:44.280
it's all Puerto Rican guys.
Yeah.
You got to eat this and because he's my ass.

625
00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:47.720
Yeah.
He my ass know,
you know,

626
00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:52.830
that's all she's getting right now.
Right.

627
00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:57.500
I gotta ask you [inaudible] Commercial Maya ass.

628
00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:01.290
Muncha Muncha Muncha Muncha yeah,
of course.

629
00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:06.960
Then she's a horrible,
poor.
All demanding respect.

630
00:44:06.961 --> 00:44:07.794
It's hilarious.

631
00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:14.413
<v 5>Okay.</v>

632
00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:20.710
<v 2>Uh,
no,
I just love it.
The pimp squad.
You miss her.
You miss her.</v>

633
00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:26.200
Some people are gay.
My
uh,

634
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:31.320
yeah,
it just makes it wasn't good and she's great man.
There's another a man,

635
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:32.543
this is

636
00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:35.400
<v 5>so demeaning and so funny.</v>

637
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:42.080
I was watching underworld inc on um,

638
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:46.850
on Netflix and they have,
you know,

639
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:51.020
a different underworld.
Documentary episodes basically.
Yeah.

640
00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:54.150
Guns,
drugs,
sex

641
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:57.500
<v 2>trafficking.
Like we pitched this show,
I pitched a show in the 90s.
Yeah,
I know.</v>

642
00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:01.980
<v 5>So it's like a spice,
right?
Yeah.
Cover all the cool stuff in life.</v>

643
00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:06.890
They have this dude,
um,
on the show.
Let's see.
I want to make sure I,

644
00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:11.810
I,
I certainly wouldn't want to disrespect this pimp.
His name is big town and uh,

645
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:17.340
he's riding around Oakland shouting out to his girls.

646
00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:21.810
Well,
he,
uh,
I'll just,

647
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:26.070
I can't do him justice,
so just watch him do his thing.

648
00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:32.000
<v 4>Oakland,

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:47.480
big town offers a warped idea of providing protection to him.

652
00:45:47.481 --> 00:45:51.080
Women aren't people,
their assets,
he controls.

653
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:54.910
He has a management style man.

They don't show his face.

660
00:46:20.261 --> 00:46:24.900

What'd he say about wings?

662
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:29.310
He said something about where to get Joe wags.

663

668
00:46:52.031 --> 00:46:54.710

Yeah.</v>

670

Yeah,

672
00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:12.420
<v 12>prostitution is 100% more profitable drugs.</v>

673
00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:14.150
Oh yeah.
That's for sure.

674
00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:19.570
You could stay at $1,000 dress and these holes once you get fist one whole clear

675
00:47:20.421 --> 00:47:23.960
what you put out their first night as you're doing this real.

676
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:29.870
So I then did a day prostitution is 100% profit here.

677
00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:32.950
That ain't gonna work.
Bitch.

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:43.250
he's so fucking fat and lazy that he just drives around and yells insults.

680
00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:46.890
He doesn't even walk up to them and solve them.
Well,
you can also hear his mouth.

681
00:47:46.891 --> 00:47:49.170
You're good.
He's got the biggie smalls.

<v 12>Yeah.
Well it's also a terrible part about Oakland.</v>

683
00:47:51.861 --> 00:47:54.610
California is also blessed with what Nigga selling pussy.

684
00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:58.340
They got so much good apply to deal with,
man.
They don't have the manpower.

685
00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:00.110
Donate to the prostitution.

686
00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:04.820
Oakland coincides with pimping man.

687
00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:08.210

711
00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:43.470
<v 12>But preventing women from going independent is the key to his business.</v>

712
00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:47.510
The thoroughbred.
When a guy made a whole day.

713
00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:50.450
<v 2>So they call it renegades again.
We've heard this term right?</v>

714
00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:53.110
And the other documentary.
Yeah.
These are homes that want to do it on their own.

715
00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:57.420
Right.
Renegades.
Yeah.

She's as,
as opposed to entrepreneurs,

716
00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:59.770
entrepreneur,
what is what they is

717
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:03.470
<v 12>tear it off a door and the garbage can put that on the 10 o'clock news.</v>

718
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:05.180
That's where I think about a real,

719
00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:08.420
when a gay man that's terrible looking at home,

720
00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:14.000
<v 2>he stabs targeting.
What'd you looking at?</v>

723
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:27.680
<v 2>Jassal what a piece of shit this guy is talking about beating the out of girls</v>

724
00:50:27.681 --> 00:50:30.200
and then he only pauses to yell at them from the car.

725
00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:34.000
That lazy piece of Shit won't even get out of his car to yell at them.
Yeah.

726
00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:37.480
Unbelievable.

727
00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:41.570

728
00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:45.830

812
00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:05.120
You know what's really in our cool is that I had a jacket that I had tailored,

813
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:07.820
uh,
cause I was super fat when I deliver.

814
00:57:07.821 --> 00:57:12.260
After I delivered the kid and I got this nice jacket and I had a tailored so

that I could look normal on stage.

816
00:57:14.061 --> 00:57:17.750
And then I came home from the comedy store the other night and I was so happy to

but it's a black and white coat.
So it doesn't need to be shouting,
shouting you.

827
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:57.950
Can you look,
I mean blue man,
is that really,

828
00:57:57.951 --> 00:57:59.630
that is it really that bad?

829
00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:00.890
<v 15>Okay.</v>

830
00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:03.950
<v 2>I was feeling pretty good about myself too.
I came,
I was feeling myself.</v>

831
00:58:03.951 --> 00:58:05.000
I was feeling like Tamar,

832
00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:09.840
I came back on auto focus

833
00:58:11.530 --> 00:58:13.660
<v 15>on top.
There's an auto focus button.</v>

834
00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:17.470
<v 2>I came back from the store and I felt as good as tamer</v>

835
00:58:17.730 --> 00:58:21.080
<v 15>is auto.
It's on manual.
Oh,
that's why.
Yeah.</v>

836
00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:26.940
<v 2>Okay.
Uh,
what's not.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

837
00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:28.440
So what do you think of the photo though?

838
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:30.103
<v 15>Uh,</v>

839
00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:35.420
<v 2>our teacher.
No,
no,
no.
Thank you.
Blue Man.</v>

840
00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:38.180
You can't really tell on this picture though.
To be fair.

841
00:58:38.181 --> 00:58:39.620
We should take another picture.
Fine.

842
00:58:39.621 --> 00:58:44.360
We'll take another photograph of my code that I had tailored to fit my fat

843
00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:49.220
postpartum body to make me feel better about myself.
Say That and then,
you know,

844
00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:53.840
oh,
look at you.
You're an art teacher.
Thanks Tom.
What,

845
00:58:53.841 --> 00:58:55.370
what are you doing?
Where are you going through?

846
00:58:55.371 --> 00:58:57.230
My is just too much going on over here.

847
00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:58.970
Why are you going through my Instagram account right now?

848
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.970
Why can't I go through it?
Because it's my phone.
Gimme My,
my phone.

849
00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:04.460
Let me see what else you got.
You don't let me go through your shit.

850
00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:07.010
Give it to me.
How come you know the codes to all my shit?

851
00:59:07.011 --> 00:59:11.140
I don't know any of the cozy or shit.
She going through my shit just now.

852
00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:14.930
Just to see what's going on.
Yeah.
You don't need to see what's going on.
Why not?

853
00:59:15.310 --> 00:59:18.920
You're a fucking look at the CC this thing.
This cat burka.
Yeah.

854
00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:23.930
We got this for our dog.
Busy.
You should show this to any of it.
Yeah.
This is,

855
00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:27.140
uh,
the dog.
The solution to the bitsy problem.

856
00:59:27.590 --> 00:59:30.440
We can't stop her from eating everything.
Giving herself diarrhea.

857
00:59:30.441 --> 00:59:32.460
So I bought her a burka.
Yeah,

858
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:37.250
put her on her face and her covers her mouth so she can't eat stuff and it's

859
00:59:37.251 --> 00:59:40.640
been working so far.
She hasn't had diarrhea and like a week and a half.

860
00:59:41.070 --> 00:59:46.070
I like to have your password to your phone to cause you the passcode is all my

861
00:59:46.131 --> 00:59:49.490
shit and I don't have any two years.
What do you really annoying.

862
00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:53.170
I just want to look through your stuff too.
Like oh look at my stuff,
Ya know,

863
00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:57.410
I know I'll be fucking on the couch and you'll just be like,
dude,
did you?

864
00:59:57.410 --> 00:59:59.720
I'm like,
where's my phone?
You're like,
oh,
I'm on it right now.

865
00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:04.520
Blah Blah Blah Blah.
Ordering food,
doing things,
ordering Amazon.

866
01:00:04.550 --> 01:00:05.031
By the way,

867
01:00:05.031 --> 01:00:09.040
if you have an a already bookmark your mom's house bike has dotcom com.

868
01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:11.820
Use the portal on our home.
Paige to shop on Amazon.

869
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:15.710
I don't go through your phone.
You totally do.

870
01:00:15.711 --> 01:00:18.830
I seem to never go to your phone and use all my apps.

871
01:00:18.831 --> 01:00:22.150
You're ordering door dashawn here we instacart.
Okay.

872
01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:27.220
Sense that we use the APP on one person's phone for things coming to the house.

873
01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:31.580
All right,
so when we owed or groceries or dinner or something,

874
01:00:31.581 --> 01:00:34.130
we do it on that end,
but you hand me the phone,
you go here.
I mean,

875
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:35.560
you act like I'm taking it,
but then before,

876
01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:40.160
but I'll be doing something else and you'll be on my phone looking at my
picture.

877
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:44.630
No,
I don't.
Why was this picture?
No,
I don't.
No,
I do not.

878
01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:46.430
I'm not interested in going through your phone.

879
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:50.420
We had killer Thai massages on Friday.

880
01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:55.870
You want him,
ma?

881
01:00:57.130 --> 01:01:01.160
Not Tom hates couples massages.
Have we talked about this on the show?

882
01:01:01.161 --> 01:01:04.510
I don't think we've had it up.
Oh,
where the,
the lady one time goes one,

883
01:01:04.511 --> 01:01:09.480
two couples massage.
Tell him what God,
no,

884
01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:12.360
God,
it sounds fucking terrible.
I was like,
relax.

885
01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.540
And so you made a big thing of it.
Yeah.
Well,
yeah,

886
01:01:15.541 --> 01:01:17.460
it's a little embarrassingly here.
My husband,

887
01:01:17.461 --> 01:01:18.810
we're supposed to do stuff together.

888
01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:22.350
We did do stuff together so they didn't want to put us together because then you

889
01:01:22.351 --> 01:01:26.670
go,
oh,
is she going to be able to walk on my back?
Yeah.
And they're like,
oh no.

890
01:01:26.671 --> 01:01:31.170
90% the same womb.
So then they had to give a separate rooms where they say,

891
01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:36.370
I don't remember.
You just said it though.
I remember,

892
01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:41.250
but you just said it.
No,
no,
no.
Cause I said I hadn't slept a lot.

893
01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:44.510
You're going to walk on my back and you go and they said no,
not at,

894
01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.610
not in the same room sir.
That's it.

895
01:01:47.611 --> 01:01:51.530
Then they put you in another room and did she walk on your back?
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.

896
01:01:51.690 --> 01:01:53.790
That's good.
My lady weighed about

897
01:01:55.380 --> 01:02:00.120
two 50 she listens to the show,
maybe she courses to the show.

898
01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:05.820
There's no way she listens to the show and she jumped up on my bag and I had

899
01:02:06.371 --> 01:02:08.170
that moment of like,
oh fuck,

900
01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:11.680
she's two 50 at least I thought she was going to break me for sure.

901
01:02:11.830 --> 01:02:14.110
So I had to be like,
oh I just had a baby three months ago.

902
01:02:14.111 --> 01:02:17.440
Take it easy on me instead of you're too fat to be just sitting on top of me.

903
01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:20.260
Cause what do you do?
What?
She's a big then she,
oh I'm

904
01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:24.750
<v 0>so sorry.
And she backed up,
you know.
But what do you do if she's a big old bitch?</v>

905
01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:30.210
You do the heavier,
the better actually.
Seriously.

906
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.280
Really?
Yeah.
Cause you feel the,

907
01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:36.690
but you said she was too hard on you this time and she was not big.
That's the,

908
01:02:36.691 --> 01:02:40.350
I could not believe it.
She was tiny and I was like,
oh,

909
01:02:40.610 --> 01:02:42.900
like my eyes were watering.
I was like,
Jesus.

910
01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:47.730
But she also was doing things that didn't really like,

911
01:02:47.731 --> 01:02:52.050
there's certain parts of like,
you know your Shin or your,

912
01:02:52.051 --> 01:02:53.970
your outer like the quad,

913
01:02:53.971 --> 01:02:58.040
I forgot the name there where it's sensitive almost I think on everyone.

914
01:02:58.050 --> 01:03:02.730
And she was going full pressure off.
I'll go,
ha ha,
like that.
And she goes,

915
01:03:02.790 --> 01:03:05.930
ah.
And they always laugh when you ever,
I was like,
wow.
She's like,

916
01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:11.070
I only think it would take it easy there.
Oh,
okay.
My favorite,

917
01:03:11.130 --> 01:03:15.300
they stretch you and it's always too much.
It's always too much of a stretch.

918
01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:19.680
Yeah.
My inner thigh mean Israel delicate and she was mad.
I was like,
dude,

919
01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:23.340
sometimes the stretches are too aggressive that he did a,

920
01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:27.690
I was facedown,
takes my leg up,

921
01:03:27.691 --> 01:03:30.150
like bend at the knee and then immediately push it to my,

922
01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:34.350
I was like maybe ease into that.
You know,
why don't we do it?

923
01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:36.960
And kind of steps.

924
01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:40.360
I don't like when they crack anything on me too.
I'm interacting.
I like,

925
01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:43.560
I like crack but I don't trust the neck a crack.

926
01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:48.160
Oh are we used to live on the east side and we used to go to the same place like

927
01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:52.030
every time there was a girl who would go like take your time to go.

928
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:55.860
She just snap your neck.

929
01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:59.950
Well cause these motherfuckers are not chiropractic.
No qualified.

930
01:03:59.951 --> 01:04:03.360
And they would just like whisk her off to another,

931
01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:07.770
a massage place.
They'd be like uh,
Kathy killed somebody.

932
01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:12.570
Make her go to Kathy.
That's always there.
Dan.
Cathy,
why did he kill someone?

933
01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:15.660
Sent her over to sunrise massage because she can't work here no more.

934
01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:22.110
But this place was nice cause you noted that it didn't smell like they're stinky

935
01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:24.630
food sometimes with with ty.

936
01:04:24.631 --> 01:04:28.590
It'll just be like a restaurant because they're all bring in.
Yeah.

937
01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:30.840
And it stinks like a fucking restaurant.

938
01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:35.960
It's always real spicy to tally.
Well that's going to give you a ring stand.

939
01:04:37.050 --> 01:04:41.160
Sometimes I smell their breath when they put your face up and then I closed

940
01:04:41.161 --> 01:04:45.630
garlic breath.
One thing I don't like to hear is when it,

941
01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:49.350
um,
when the massage takes too much out of the person,

942
01:04:49.351 --> 01:04:54.220
you hear them breathe and their like
and I'm like,

943
01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:58.660
dude,
I'm not going to relax with you hyperventilating or wait here.

944
01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:04.560
Yeah,
that's true.
But the time is,
I just always a great cause it's dirt cheap.

945
01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:07.300
It's so cheap.
That's the whole thing you can do.

946
01:05:07.330 --> 01:05:11.790
You feel you can do it all the time.
It's so cheap.
One time I went to a resort,

947
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:15.570
it was,
my dad had a business trip and I went there and I had like,

948
01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:18.010
it was like a five star resort,
had a spa and I go,

949
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:19.030
<v 2>I'm gonna go get a massage.</v>

950
01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:23.890
I call it him to think to specify things that gave me an old man.

951
01:05:24.290 --> 01:05:26.680
Yes.
And during the massage he was like,

952
01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.360
like every pressure thing.
I,

953
01:05:32.361 --> 01:05:35.830
it sounded like it was his last breath every single time.
It's just

954
01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:40.630
all I listened to the whole time was this guy breathing.

955
01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:43.390
I hope you enjoy yourself.

956
01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:47.650
This is my last massage and it was,
it was rough,
man.

957
01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:51.880
I used to go to this guy.
This one guy in silver lake.
Oh yeah,

958
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:54.730
we heard a lot about him.
Yeah,
he's great.

959
01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.850
Apparently though he was touching the tits cause I sent him,

960
01:05:58.270 --> 01:06:03.010
I said other girls to him and he was touching their tits.
Nice.

961
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:08.680
Well I'm saying you shouldn't do that,
but nice.
He never touched my tits.
Sure.

962
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:13.750
Suburbs.
This conclude the tape.

963
01:06:13.751 --> 01:06:18.550
Why could you flip over?
Give you a tip.

964
01:06:18.551 --> 01:06:19.384
Massage.
Now

965
01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:26.260
what if that is the reason it's going in?
Of course that's terrible.

966
01:06:26.290 --> 01:06:29.590
It could be that,
but apparently he was feeling up all the other people.

967
01:06:29.591 --> 01:06:32.800
He never phoned me up.
Maybe you wanted a little bit.
Two of my friends,

968
01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:37.210
they said that he felt
so.
Did you um,

969
01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:39.730
they said that they felt him up that day.
When you,

970
01:06:39.731 --> 01:06:43.390
when you go on your bag that he was giving them tiddy massage.
I don't think so.

971
01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:48.250
This guy was a little,
a feminine.
He wasn't,
you know,
he never did it to you?

972
01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:52.630
Not once.
Why you think he did not?
Because I've got huge sloppers.

973
01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.100
Why would he not want to feel those?

974
01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:57.040
He didn't know where they began and where they ended or something.
I don't know.

975
01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:00.280
Okay.
No,
because I don't,
I don't know.
I don't know why.

976
01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:04.450
Maybe he saw you come in with me a few times and he knew like this bitch has a

977
01:07:04.451 --> 01:07:09.370
bear.
Got a big bear with you.
Um Hm.

978
01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.070
Yeah.
Do you miss him?
I do,
yeah.

979
01:07:13.210 --> 01:07:17.620
I was kind of contemplating driving to go see him again.
Really?
Yeah.
Wow.

980
01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:21.970
Yeah.
Good guy.
He was really good.
I don't to be still there.
That's really love,

981
01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:22.390
man.

982
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:26.000
I know and I'm so bummed because I are a few people that we left behind at her

983
01:07:26.001 --> 01:07:29.740
old place.
Really good.
Once you,
that's hard to find.

984
01:07:29.741 --> 01:07:33.070
Once you find that special person,
their price is right.
They do the shit.

985
01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:37.040
You didn't want to leave him,
you know?
Nope.

986
01:07:38.410 --> 01:07:40.270
My life is hard.
Life is hard.

987
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:44.710
We kind of makes you want to listen to this.

988
01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:49.720
That like for me,
even if who knows what happens with the film,

989
01:07:49.721 --> 01:07:54.610
but like that work so shocking and crazy that I was like,
Whoa,

990
01:07:54.611 --> 01:07:57.640
I can't believe I did that.
But it feels really good too.

991
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:59.260
It gets things out of you.
I don't know.

992
01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:04.790
That's acting for me is when I feel like something from my life like really

993
01:08:08.050 --> 01:08:10.570
was undone and released.

994
01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:16.280
That's a Kirsten Dunst and that's curious and dance.
Oh Wow.

995
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:17.450
<v 0>She did a little vocal fry.</v>

996
01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:21.670
They're kind of up there with the,
uh,

997
01:08:21.810 --> 01:08:23.750
the Lord of all Improv.
His birthday.

998
01:08:23.751 --> 01:08:28.440
It was birthday was a just yet yesterday I believe.
A smurf day.

999
01:08:28.441 --> 01:08:32.650
Steven Sea Gal,
Gal turned 64 years old.
Uh,

1000
01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:37.660
we should point out that he has a couple films that just hit Netflix.

1001
01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.590
No,
uh,

1002
01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:46.560
I think a good man and absolution or now,
now on Netflix.

1003
01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:50.090
We should watch those.
Um,
we should check those out.
I would love,

1004
01:08:53.170 --> 01:08:57.310
so we should.
Um,
but can we sit through the whole film?
That's the problem.

1005
01:08:57.311 --> 01:09:02.310
That is the,
the real challenge.
Here's the,

1006
01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:03.820
do you think we can sit through the whole film?

1007
01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:06.763
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1008
01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:13.170
<v 0>Yeah.
Gosh,
it's really,
at first I thought it was a start.</v>

1009
01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:15.983
<v 3>Uh,</v>

1010
01:09:19.810 --> 01:09:20.800
uh,

1011
01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:25.370
<v 0>it's really something,
right?
She may listen to actor.
Right.</v>

1012
01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.580
And here's a seek out.

1013
01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:37.273
<v 3>Uh,</v>

1014
01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:44.340
<v 0>yeah,
she's a good actress.
She's,
and she was great in the Fargo.</v>

1015
01:09:44.670 --> 01:09:48.030
Fucking amazing.
Yeah.
She's really talented.
I like her a lot.

1016
01:09:48.210 --> 01:09:51.630
Fargo Fargo.
Sorry.
Uh,
by the way,

1017
01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:57.080
we have finally we caught up on better call Saul and how sofar it's,

1018
01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:02.300
we're finally getting into it.
Caught up now,
but we're starting to finally,
yeah.

1019
01:10:02.370 --> 01:10:06.780
I'm not really fucking,
I dunno man.
It's making me very,
very unhappy.

1020
01:10:06.810 --> 01:10:11.430
Why are you so upset,
Tom?
I like when Francis and Clare,

1021
01:10:11.431 --> 01:10:13.920
but sniffing Underwood.
Yeah,
I liked it.

1022
01:10:13.921 --> 01:10:17.520
They were psychos and I liked that they were,
you know,

1023
01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:21.240
just winning at all costs.
Savages.

1024
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:25.200
But I like when they're together.
Yeah.
When they are team Jean's team genes.

1025
01:10:25.201 --> 01:10:28.170
When they put one leg in each panel and they pulled him up.

1026
01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:31.980
But now this new season,
I don't want to give anything away,

1027
01:10:31.981 --> 01:10:36.780
but they're very against each other if it's jeans against jeans.
Yeah.

1028
01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:40.320
Yeah.
And I agree.
I'm not interested in,
yeah.
Yeah.
I know.

1029
01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:45.430
I like to see them as a team.
Cosby team trials.
Yeah.
Oh Wow.
I know.

1030
01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:49.920
But,
uh,
you know,
Claire's,
but it looks like it smells fresher than ever.

1031
01:10:50.370 --> 01:10:54.910
She's really,
really spice you on that stuff.
Straightened that ass.
Stretton that

1032
01:10:56.940 --> 01:11:01.110
she um,
yeah,
she's flexing it man.
She's really like,

1033
01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:03.690
we'll see what happens so far.
It's very interesting.
Yeah.

1034
01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:05.400
I'm on board by the way.

1035
01:11:05.401 --> 01:11:08.530
I was watching a little bit with my sister was here with her,
uh,

1036
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.700
fiance and um,

1037
01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:14.010
we started to watch peewees

1038
01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.960
<v 2>big holiday.
Right,
right.
That's a new movie.</v>

1039
01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:22.400
<v 5>You know what would amaze me?
Um,
they go,
how old is peewee?</v>

1040
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:27.710
And I said,
uh,
he's gotta be late forties.
I was assuming,
you know,

1041
01:11:28.730 --> 01:11:32.630
and anyways,
I looked it up.
Do you know how old he is?

1042
01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:35.240
Fifties 63.

1043
01:11:35.710 --> 01:11:40.040
<v 2>Peewee Herman.
63,
63 years old.
Wow.
Credible.</v>

1044
01:11:40.041 --> 01:11:42.420
It makes sense because what it does when you really think about it,
yeah,

1045
01:11:42.490 --> 01:11:45.700
but it's still,
wow.
He looks great,
dude.

1046
01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:50.680
Pee Wee Herman is special effects really to make him look younger.

1047
01:11:50.681 --> 01:11:52.480
Blue man says,
oh,
in that film

1048
01:11:54.090 --> 01:11:56.820
<v 5>thing,
I read an article on it like yesterday.</v>

1049
01:11:57.020 --> 01:12:00.380
<v 2>Oh,
so he read an article the man says,
and they made him look younger.</v>

1050
01:12:00.890 --> 01:12:03.230
I guess he's a character has to be that young.

1051
01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:06.890
The whole thing is that the character is,
yeah.
Think Eternal Youth,
but yeah,

1052
01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:12.130
but we're talking about a guy who's not far from 70.
Right.

1053
01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:15.440
Still looks great even being,
you know,
that whole thing.

1054
01:12:15.441 --> 01:12:20.090
It was so sad that he lost his career over Jerkin it in a porno theater who

1055
01:12:20.091 --> 01:12:23.060
hasn't done that.
Right.
I mean,
if I had half his career,

1056
01:12:23.061 --> 01:12:25.850
I'd be fucking in the dumps.
Right.
Many times over.

1057
01:12:25.851 --> 01:12:30.430
I've jerked off and fucking phone booth hospitals,
right?
Yeah,

1058
01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:34.970
right.
Funerals.
Absolutely.
My Dad's funeral.
Your Dad's feet.

1059
01:12:37.130 --> 01:12:40.130
But see,
I mean,
look of all places to jerk off in public.

1060
01:12:40.131 --> 01:12:44.270
That's kind of where you're supposed to Jack.
It is at the movie theater,

1061
01:12:44.271 --> 01:12:47.900
the plays dirty movies.
And he got really reigned for that.

1062
01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:49.620
I read a little recap about it.

1063
01:12:49.790 --> 01:12:51.980
<v 5>Um,
it,
you know,</v>

1064
01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:57.460
just because I had just read about him and apparently,

1065
01:12:58.431 --> 01:12:58.641
you know,

1066
01:12:58.641 --> 01:13:03.641
there was like a sting operation going on there and they had arrested some

1067
01:13:04.251 --> 01:13:09.251
people in the theater and he was actually walking out and someone spotted him

1068
01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:15.200
and it's almost like they were like,
oh,
that's,
and he goes,

1069
01:13:15.201 --> 01:13:17.090
I'm peewee Burmis and then get him.

1070
01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:22.300
And then he offered the police department to do a show for free for like kids in

1071
01:13:24.531 --> 01:13:26.750
the area to make the story to go away.
Yeah.

1072
01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:31.220
And then his lawyers also approached the da with that with like,

1073
01:13:31.221 --> 01:13:33.500
can he do it?
They were like,
no,
of course not.

1074
01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:37.790
<v 2>That's terrible.
Oh God.
Well,</v>

1075
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:41.670
when you think about the transgressions of other famous people like George

1076
01:13:41.670 --> 01:13:44.450
Michael,
wasn't he jerking it in a bathroom stall?
No blow jobs,

1077
01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:47.960
no job and didn't ruin his career.
Yeah.
Well that sucks.

1078
01:13:47.970 --> 01:13:52.680
The thing that Sucks for a pee wee is that he was a chill guy.
Yeah.

1079
01:13:53.370 --> 01:13:55.860
Well,
I mean,
can we teach our kids about masturbating?

1080
01:13:55.861 --> 01:13:58.560
Is that not part of the curriculum anymore?
I mean,

1081
01:13:58.561 --> 01:14:01.290
your dad probably showed you how to masturbate very early.

1082
01:14:01.291 --> 01:14:03.450
That's one thing that he was not,

1083
01:14:04.530 --> 01:14:07.980
those two didn't talk about that.
Huh?

1084
01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:13.450
<v 5>Not even a tiny,
tiny bit.
And that's,
yeah,
no,
no,</v>

1085
01:14:13.451 --> 01:14:15.600
I don't think my parents told me,

1086
01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:20.710
I can remember a couple of masturbation things as a kid.

1087
01:14:20.711 --> 01:14:25.711
One time I had masturbated and I just wanted to kind of feel like it was

1088
01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:30.550
somewhat,
you know,
okay.
I knew what I was doing,
but you know,

1089
01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:35.200
I was probably like 10.
So I went to my dad and I go,

1090
01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:40.180
um,
I was taking a shower that was washing,
you know,

1091
01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:45.960
between my legs and then this stuff came out and he goes,

1092
01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:52.150
they'll wash along next time
and then walked away.

1093
01:14:52.151 --> 01:14:54.420
And I was like,
Oh yeah,

1094
01:14:56.540 --> 01:15:01.410
<v 0>I guess I shouldn't do that.
Yeah.
Did you feel guilty course?
Yeah.</v>

1095
01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:03.690
So weird.
And another time I remember I approached him

1096
01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:07.570
<v 5>when I was like,
um,
do you ever masturbate?</v>

1097
01:15:07.630 --> 01:15:11.470
I just straight up asked him and he goes,
one time when I was 16

1098
01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:14.660
<v 0>it was like,
that's it.
And he was like,
yeah,</v>

1099
01:15:17.150 --> 01:15:19.280
but what would be better?
Like I was thinking about it.

1100
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:21.350
Would you want your dad to talk to you about it?

1101
01:15:21.351 --> 01:15:23.660
Not that he would be like coming out when you watch me do something.

1102
01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:25.850
Not like that,
but I think,

1103
01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:30.350
I think the approach that I would have preferred would be like,
hey,

1104
01:15:30.650 --> 01:15:33.170
just so you know.
I mean,
it would have been weird,
right?
He'd be like,
yeah,

1105
01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:34.970
masturbating.
I'd be like,
I don't want to hear about,
he'd be like,

1106
01:15:34.971 --> 01:15:39.710
just so you know,
you know,
you do it in private,
in your room or in the bathroom.

1107
01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:44.570
It's normal to do it not 10 times a day,
but you're going to,

1108
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:46.640
you know,
it's going to happen.
Like just wait,

1109
01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:49.630
let you know that you're in the realm of normal behavior.
Right?
Yeah.

1110
01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:53.410
Someone needs to tell you that.
Yeah.
I felt like I was a total Darrell.
Oh,

1111
01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:54.350
that's so interesting.

1112
01:15:54.351 --> 01:15:58.730
Because even like my mother bought me a book called what's happening to my body

1113
01:15:59.510 --> 01:16:04.040
and it was so dumb and I,
you know,
I told you about armpit hair and periods.
Yeah.

1114
01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:07.050
But I don't even think there was a section about masturbating.

1115
01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:10.790
The total it should be there should.
That should have been like chapter one.
Hey,

1116
01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:12.260
this is what you should be doing.

1117
01:16:12.261 --> 01:16:15.200
It's normal sometimes when you do this and make your pussy feel good

1118
01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:22.700
like that.
Right.
Are you going to talk to our son about this?
For sure.

1119
01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:27.470
Like what age?
Six.
Six?
No,
no,
no.

1120
01:16:27.471 --> 01:16:31.010
But when he's a little bit,
I don't know.
Probably like 12 getting into puberty.

1121
01:16:31.011 --> 01:16:35.780
Yeah.
11 amen.
Here's the rules.
Okay.
And a stroke your hormones to do.

1122
01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:38.010
Yeah.
Do it in the bathroom.

1123
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.330
<v 5>Try to get it down the drain</v>

1124
01:16:42.570 --> 01:16:45.780
<v 0>you do in your bedroom.
Oh,
this hurts my ears.
Shut the door.</v>

1125
01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:49.080
Nobody wants to hear about it.
Nobody wants to hear about it.

1126
01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:52.800
And don't make mom clean your laundry with your crusty socks and stuff.

1127
01:16:52.801 --> 01:16:55.710
I bet you did that right,
right.
Yeah.
You're such a dope.
Oh,

1128
01:16:55.711 --> 01:16:59.340
shoot it into my boxers.
Oh my God.
I'm going to throw out,
crossed up.

1129
01:16:59.341 --> 01:17:00.600
And then I would throw them under the bed.

1130
01:17:00.930 --> 01:17:05.930
So then like six to 12 pairs of frosty boxers and I would just throw them in the

1131
01:17:06.781 --> 01:17:10.040
laundry chute.
And

1132
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:13.160
<v 2>your mother did it?
Yeah.
She never said anything to you like,
Hey,</v>

1133
01:17:13.170 --> 01:17:16.220
you're Chinese or kind of new.
I used to do that.
I'd be embarrassed by them.

1134
01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:20.690
So I would soak,
there was a sink next to our laundry machine,
I don't know,

1135
01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:21.051
whatever.

1136
01:17:21.051 --> 01:17:24.560
It's just a laundry sink and I would throw all my boxes in there and wet them.

1137
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:28.310
So they would,
they would get right.
That's humane.
Yeah.
They would soak,

1138
01:17:28.450 --> 01:17:30.530
cause you don't really have a sense of shame.

1139
01:17:30.650 --> 01:17:34.730
Like I asked you to stop by the drug started to make some sexual purchases for

1140
01:17:34.731 --> 01:17:35.564
us.

1141
01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:36.960
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1142
01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:40.350
<v 2>And you left the bag of rubber is just,
no,
not even that.</v>

1143
01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:43.050
You just took it out of the box,
put it right on the Credenza,

1144
01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:47.640
right in the hallway.
Whoever comes over and can just see our box or rubbers.

1145
01:17:47.641 --> 01:17:51.960
Thank you.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Do you have any sense of shame or number of the other one?

1146
01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:55.080
The uh,
the cock rings.
Yeah,
that was fun.

1147
01:17:55.081 --> 01:17:57.600
And our housekeeper put them in a plastic bag for you.

1148
01:17:57.870 --> 01:18:00.690
But I told you she didn't know.
She does not know.

1149
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:04.830
They don't have those in her country.
She,
she just thought like,
oh,

1150
01:18:04.831 --> 01:18:05.910
these are new rubber bands are.

1151
01:18:05.911 --> 01:18:10.260
So that's why she put them in a sanitary Ziploc bag next to your bed.

1152
01:18:10.530 --> 01:18:12.030
She didn't say shit.
No.

1153
01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:16.430
That's the best part about her is that she's in these uh,

1154
01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:20.270
keep your cock hard.
Let me sir,

I mean that's what house,

Where is um,
pushy.

1240
01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:26.970
Pushy.
Okay.

1241
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.320
I can't even open up what up my and she surely this.
Alright.
Um,

1242
01:24:32.250 --> 01:24:35.020

I remember I called,

1243
01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:39.450
they wrote back to her.
Oh my goodness.
Here we go.

1244
01:24:39.790 --> 01:24:42.210
He says a bone.
George John Pierre.

1245
01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:45.630
Thank you for calling Laquana sparkling water.

1247

We are even happier that you're pronouncing like qua correctly.

1248
01:24:52.590 --> 01:24:54.590
We receive hundreds of calls from fuckboys.

1249
01:24:55.490 --> 01:25:00.490
What Pos people pronouncing it lacroix like enjoy Ching Chong Ching Chong

1250
01:25:01.891 --> 01:25:04.440
dummies.
I bet they pronounced the FedEx like Fedex.

1251
01:25:04.710 --> 01:25:07.950
In order to correctly answer your question about carbonation making you belch

1252
01:25:07.951 --> 01:25:12.150
out,
not fluctuate.
At first,
my bus first share a little history on our product,

1253
01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:15.690
our mango sparkling water.
It was invented by Nazi scientists.

1254
01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:19.350
The story goes out off haler demanded the sparkling water beverage with high

1255
01:25:19.351 --> 01:25:23.370
carbonation so he could belch and faces of Jews in the hundreds block of

1256
01:25:23.371 --> 01:25:24.204
Auschwitz.

1257
01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:29.540
Original drink was debuted on four 20 Hitler's birthday at the Ventura Harbor

1258
01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:34.530
Comedy Club.
I'm seeming yes,
historical record tells us that Jews would shout,

1259
01:25:34.531 --> 01:25:38.820
Hey Hitler,
and if two young gentlemen were there,
it had high and tight jeans,

1260
01:25:38.821 --> 01:25:42.750
enough out off would belch a beef cream right in their face.
Those lucky Jews.

1261
01:25:42.930 --> 01:25:45.860
Even today we stay true to our original formula.
No,

1262
01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:50.100
what I'm saying it is good for the fewer well it is good for Mr. White folks and

1263
01:25:50.101 --> 01:25:53.810
big Daddy Kane sub cane.
I do have good news for you.
Likewise,

1264
01:25:53.830 --> 01:25:58.530
scientists are working on a special formula that guarantees double pipe classics

1265
01:25:58.531 --> 01:26:01.230
in every can.
This will revolutionize the soda game.

1266
01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:05.570
Never has a soda affected the how you say rectum and the esophagus.

1267
01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:10.250
At the same time that drink will be unveiled in new port titties at Carolina

1268
01:26:10.251 --> 01:26:11.570
September 8th,
ninth and 10th.

1269
01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:16.190
This is a poly by friendly establishment Dj dad mouth will be spinning records

1270
01:26:16.191 --> 01:26:18.230

<v 2>Wow.
Thank you.
Wow.
How interesting.</v>

1274
01:26:28.341 --> 01:26:31.700
They drives all these references that sound familiar to it is,

1275
01:26:31.701 --> 01:26:36.080
it does sound familiar?
It does.
Sound familiar.
Thank you for getting back to us.

1276
01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:39.960
Yeah.
Hmm.
Don't roll your eyes.
I saw that you're like,
it's not like,

1277
01:26:40.190 --> 01:26:43.370
I mean it's Lacroix,
it's on our website.
That correct.

1278
01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:48.220
<v 5>Matthew,</v>

1279
01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:49.870
<v 2>what's your favorite flavor right now?</v>

1280
01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:53.380
Because we've got quite a few in the house.
We've got,
we've got mango,

1281
01:26:53.381 --> 01:26:57.940
apricot and strawberry.
Pineapple.
I like the star rape level the most.
Yeah,

1282
01:26:57.941 --> 01:27:01.600
that one's good.
Yeah.
Wait,
which one do you not like the apricot?
I think it's,

1283
01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:04.630
I can't remember.
It might be the mango APP.
I didn't really like it.

1284
01:27:04.631 --> 01:27:05.464
I didn't like the way.

1285
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:09.170
<v 5>What should I do with the,
um,
the different,</v>

1286
01:27:09.171 --> 01:27:14.090
comparing the different ethnicities.
Oh Shit.
Can I pass really quickly?

1287
01:27:14.091 --> 01:27:18.740
I got a peek.
Real,
real bad.
Okay.
All right.
Uh,

1288
01:27:18.770 --> 01:27:23.270
how was your peachy?
Oh man,
I was so powerful.
I really had to go

1289
01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:25.310
<v 2>bad.
I really held onto it too long.</v>

1290
01:27:26.130 --> 01:27:30.050
Kind of a neat part about childbirth is I don't really feel my bladder when it's

1291
01:27:30.051 --> 01:27:33.150
full anymore and that just kind of have to guess.
So Nice.

1292
01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:37.930
Six year old style downs.
I know you ready to do this.
Yeah.

1293
01:27:37.931 --> 01:27:39.690
Do you guys get into it man?
Let's fucking do it.

1294
01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:47.850
<v 13>Drink the top layer</v>

1295
01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:55.100
assumptions.
Chunk
the

1296
01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:00.010
urine.
Why my button

1297
01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:03.900
or sex with your sister?

1298
01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:09.180
Grandmother walks on masturbating.

1299
01:28:09.970 --> 01:28:11.790
Never have another orgasm.

1300
01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:16.900
It's time to play.
Would you rather have

1301
01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:22.000
right.

1302
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.820
<v 5>Well that was good.
Would you rather we have a few submitted.</v>

1303
01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:29.180
Um,
as always you can submit your,

1304
01:28:29.181 --> 01:28:34.181
would you rather is to us your mom's podcast@gmail.com these came in from Mick

1305
01:28:37.731 --> 01:28:42.710
puppy breath.
Um,
okay.
One of them did.

1306
01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:44.270
Well let's read his first time.

1307
01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:48.230
Would you rather have a big healthy dick and your son has to have a micro penis?

1308
01:28:48.290 --> 01:28:52.890
Oh Geez.
Or he gets to have a big healthy dick.
And you have the micro penis.
Ah,

1309
01:28:52.970 --> 01:28:55.940
kind of really interesting question because behind that,
yeah.

1310
01:28:56.060 --> 01:29:00.710
Well the psychology and also the love that you love your offspring so much.

1311
01:29:00.711 --> 01:29:03.210
Would you rather them have the great thing?

1312
01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:07.840
<v 2>Well,
yeah,
I mean,
I've told this to you now.
If it's between you and Alice dying,</v>

1313
01:29:07.841 --> 01:29:08.674
I choose you.

1314
01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:10.600
<v 5>Thank you.
I remember that.</v>

1315
01:29:10.810 --> 01:29:14.320
It's not really one of the questions that you guys are in a boat drowning.

1316
01:29:14.350 --> 01:29:17.920
I choose my son and then you just fucking die.
Yeah,
I remember that.

1317
01:29:18.190 --> 01:29:21.730
I think my answer to that was I'd hit you in the back of the head with a fucking

1318
01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:23.890
hammer,
a claw hammer,

1319
01:29:23.950 --> 01:29:27.670
and then my son would live even though he wouldn't have to hurt you.
I just,

1320
01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:31.910
it just for the added fun,
Fun,
thanking my death hurt,

1321
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:35.560
stab you in the neck with a screwdriver.
And then I'd be like,
all right,
I lost.

1322
01:29:35.561 --> 01:29:38.410
Let's go.
Um,
thanks for that.
But no,
but do you,

1323
01:29:38.411 --> 01:29:41.080
do you understand that they're also saying,
and this one,
do you,

1324
01:29:42.010 --> 01:29:46.570
would you rather him suffer because he has a micro penis?
Yeah,
I know.

1325
01:29:46.630 --> 01:29:50.800
Or do you suffer?
And my answer is honestly,

1326
01:29:50.801 --> 01:29:55.540
I would take the big penis.
That's rude.
Give him the micro penis.
You know why?

1327
01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:59.920
Why?
He doesn't know any better.
He was a kid.
It's a baby

1328
01:30:01.450 --> 01:30:04.500
smile anyways.
Right now he's a baby.
Doesn't need a big old hug.

1329
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:06.550
Let him have a baby peanut for the rest of his life.

1330
01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:10.270
He'll find other things to get good at.
That's terrible.
Yeah.

1331
01:30:10.570 --> 01:30:13.180
I don't want to deal with that.
Look,
I'm already not packing a lot.

1332
01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:16.750
If you're telling me,
let's see the micro version of this.
Whoa.

1333
01:30:17.010 --> 01:30:19.920
<v 2>Yeah,
but you're married to me.
You're already set up.
You have love.</v>

1334
01:30:19.921 --> 01:30:21.360
I would not dump you because might yeah.

1335
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:24.910
<v 5>Grow Collins a show it off though.
I mean,
you know,
pull it out at parties.
I do.</v>

1336
01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:28.960
You know,
I'm a grown up,
right.
So yeah,
having a big old healthy one.

1337
01:30:29.410 --> 01:30:29.900
That'd be fun.

1338
01:30:29.900 --> 01:30:32.780
<v 2>But you've already lived your life.
You're old.
You're already 58 years old.</v>

1339
01:30:32.781 --> 01:30:37.190
I'm not done everything you want to do.
Yeah.
Give your son the healthy hog.

1340
01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:41.780
<v 5>I'm Christina.
Would you rather your husband have the big nice one or your son?</v>

1341
01:30:41.930 --> 01:30:45.450
My son.
But you get to benefit from the big nice one.
Yeah.

1342
01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:49.030
<v 2>Yeah.
But I've had my big nice,
I've had 39 years of big nice ones.</v>

1343
01:30:49.031 --> 01:30:52.900
Puerto Rican one's black.
One's Haitian Dominican ones.
Yeah.

1344
01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:57.670
<v 5>It's time to let my son have a bigger heart.</v>

1345
01:30:57.700 --> 01:31:01.570
I'm thinking the big healthy one.
Here's selfish man.
He'll be,
he'll be fine.

1346
01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:06.250
Are you being serious?
Am I being serious?
Yeah.
You're the worst,
right?

1347
01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:12.280
All right.
It's totally,
if I have to tell you why,
it's fine.
He'll be fine.

1348
01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:16.710
You're horrible,
man.
He's fine.
He'll get used to it.
You know?
See,

1349
01:31:16.711 --> 01:31:19.290
I've already experienced and not having my grow peanuts.

1350
01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:23.800
The amount of psychological trauma I would endure from accepting the micro penis

1351
01:31:23.801 --> 01:31:24.480
would be too.

1352
01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:27.780
<v 2>Well,
you're married.
It doesn't matter.
It does matter.</v>

1353
01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:31.150
It doesn't not showing your hog to anybody.
It doesn't matter.

1354
01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:34.850
<v 5>Doesn't matter.
No.
Thanks.</v>

1355
01:31:35.370 --> 01:31:40.370
Do you realize the amount of psychological trauma going from a normal one to a

1356
01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:44.110
be like what that would do and then just having a small dawn your whole life.

1357
01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:48.090
Exactly.
I don't know.
Listen,
this is a dick thing.
This is an I got it.
Yeah.

1358
01:31:48.290 --> 01:31:50.870
I'm the president of the Dixon.
I know.
I know.
Dude.

1359
01:31:50.930 --> 01:31:53.780
If there's one thing I know in this world's dicks and Cox and balls,

1360
01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:58.340
and I'm saying I'm taking it.
All right.
This is your domain,
your Dick Domain.

1361
01:31:58.670 --> 01:31:59.503
Fine.

1362
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:04.630
<v 2>Do you have one?
Yeah,
go ahead.
Okay.
What'd you rather?</v>

1363
01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:07.210
Every time.
Okay.

1364
01:32:07.211 --> 01:32:10.900
You can go on a vacation once a year for the rest of your life.

1365
01:32:10.930 --> 01:32:14.650
Free vacations anywhere around the world,

1366
01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:19.870
but you're on a cruise.
It's always a cruise and it's always with your family.

1367
01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:20.950
Oh my God.

1368
01:32:21.790 --> 01:32:26.790
Four or you have to spend a year alone in Alaska,

1369
01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:31.870
Alaska,
three.
Really think about it.

1370
01:32:31.871 --> 01:32:33.400
It's all a long time.

1371
01:32:37.290 --> 01:32:42.150
All right.
Hello Alaska.
Here I come,
Juno,
but here's the thing is that anchorage,

1372
01:32:42.170 --> 01:32:46.060
you do get to go on a free vacation.
It is a cruise.
It's not my favorite

1373
01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:52.750
fishing hunting a year alone in solitude.
You go crazy a year alone.

1374
01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:53.890
You're not talking to anybody.

1375
01:32:57.310 --> 01:33:01.150
That was quick when you go work for Sarah Pailin.
Yeah.
Okay.

1376
01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:04.990
Join the Pailin Campaign for Paleo for president.
See,
here's the thing.

1377
01:33:04.991 --> 01:33:06.940
I might choose a free cruise for a year,

1378
01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:11.110
even though that's what every family member that I fucking can't cannot stand.

1379
01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:16.240
Cause here's what we did on the cruise we went on last time you buy that VIP

1380
01:33:16.241 --> 01:33:20.150
pass,
it gets you in the secluded areas of the ship.
You stay away from people,

1381
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:24.910
which is what we did last week.
I would go crazy on that cruise.

1382
01:33:25.090 --> 01:33:28.240
Crazier.
I know.
Crazier than being alone.

1383
01:33:28.430 --> 01:33:32.870
<v 5>Yeah.
Okay.
Um,
that was good.</v>

1384
01:33:33.610 --> 01:33:37.670
Yeah.
Alaska.
Yeah.
Um,
but you,
Rau,
you'd take the vacation?

1385
01:33:38.130 --> 01:33:41.820
<v 2>I would because I love vacations and I would find a way,</v>

1386
01:33:41.821 --> 01:33:45.420
I mean much like in my day to day life,
I find a way to avoid my family.

1387
01:33:45.690 --> 01:33:47.580
My family lives in La and I don't see them.

1388
01:33:47.610 --> 01:33:51.660
<v 5>He realized that.
Right.
I mean I struggle with for six,</v>

1389
01:33:51.661 --> 01:33:56.340
seven hours with family.
Yeah.
So I mean,
my dad's a different story.

1390
01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:58.290
I can hang out with him.
That's your dad's amazing.

1391
01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:00.550
I can hang with him all day everyday,
but yeah.
No.

1392
01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:04.590
How about this one came in and would you rather work at a d quality hotel chain

1393
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:07.080
like a hotel?
Six super eight.

1394
01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:12.500
Anything with a number in its name as a housekeeper for the rest of your life?

1395
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:17.070
Oh,
whether there's some brutal things and you see a lot of shit.

1396
01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:18.740
Literal House.
Yes.

1397
01:34:19.710 --> 01:34:23.190
Or eat one dog shit sandwich per day for one year

1398
01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:27.530
<v 2>and that's it.
And I'm out.
After a year,
I'd have to eat the whole sandwich.</v>

1399
01:34:27.670 --> 01:34:32.480
Doesn't say a bite.
It doesn't say by,
it's the whole sandwich sandwich.

1400
01:34:32.570 --> 01:34:35.790
You get sick though.
You'd get really,
really sick every day.

1401
01:34:36.050 --> 01:34:37.670
Do you get violently ill?
No.

1402
01:34:37.671 --> 01:34:40.640
I'd rather just clean hotel rooms for the rest of your life.

1403
01:34:40.641 --> 01:34:45.130
Here's what I would do,
Bro.
I will start a side business and that hotel.
Yeah,

1404
01:34:45.490 --> 01:34:50.350
I'd sell weed or something or go work for big town.
You out of pocket?

1405
01:34:50.450 --> 01:34:51.510
Booz Allen.

1406
01:34:51.550 --> 01:34:54.920
Our convicted or I would start my own prostitution ring in the hospital.

1407
01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:57.500
I mean a hotel.

1408
01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:04.190
<v 0>I mean look,
there's,
there's worse jobs and cleaning up hotel rooms.
I know,</v>

1409
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:08.300
but that's a rough one.
Motel six is a rough one.
Harsh.
Yeah,
it's going to suck.

1410
01:35:08.490 --> 01:35:12.110
Yeah,
but eating shit is too much.
I can't do that,
dude.

1411
01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:16.310
I think I would actually do the same thing except this is my life now.

1412
01:35:16.311 --> 01:35:21.020
There are gigs that I would prefer to eat the dog shit sandwich on.

1413
01:35:21.050 --> 01:35:22.400
Oh really?
Which ones would those be?

1414
01:35:22.490 --> 01:35:27.490
Anything dealing with human beings like having to touch them like old folks

1415
01:35:27.561 --> 01:35:32.230
homes.
Like what is your job was to change like old folk divers every day.

1416
01:35:32.231 --> 01:35:35.750
I a massage therapist.
I would hate to touch strangers.

1417
01:35:35.751 --> 01:35:38.500
That's the thing we talked about that I hate touching people either.

1418
01:35:39.650 --> 01:35:42.500
I wouldn't want to do that.
Okay.
I wouldn't be,
here's the thing,

1419
01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:44.660
I wouldn't want to touch me.
Right?

1420
01:35:44.661 --> 01:35:49.661
That's when I see Nia yet I'm fucking massage me and here's a modified version

1421
01:35:50.091 --> 01:35:53.090
of this one because the,
thank you.
The thinking behind this.
This is really good.

1422
01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:57.800
Would you rather be a prostitute for that asshole?
What's his name?
High town.

1423
01:35:58.570 --> 01:36:00.920
Your big towns.
Big towns.
Oh,

1424
01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:05.780
them wings beds or you eat the dog shit sandwich.
Oh my God.

1425
01:36:05.810 --> 01:36:08.510
What's I'm saying like,
yeah,
no.
Then you'd be like,

1426
01:36:08.511 --> 01:36:10.970
I want to get violently ill every right.
Or,

1427
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:13.730
or you're like a Russian hooker.

1428
01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:17.150
You're like a Ukrainian third world stolen from the mafia,

1429
01:36:17.630 --> 01:36:22.630
by the mafia in your drug with heroin every day and you're 15 years olds and

1430
01:36:22.791 --> 01:36:25.910
you're the prostitute.
You know what I'm saying?
Like that's horrible too.

1431
01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:31.340
That's the worst job.
Like I run
this one came in,

1432
01:36:31.341 --> 01:36:36.110
I'll just read you this real quick from Sovos Jiang,
longtime listener,

1433
01:36:36.111 --> 01:36:40.190
first time,
Eli,
email time.
First Time.
First Time.

1434
01:36:41.210 --> 01:36:45.080
Would you rather have all your browns for the rest of your life be hot

1435
01:36:45.081 --> 01:36:46.100
toothpaste,
shits,

1436
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:50.630
you know where you need to wipe at least like eight to 13 times.

1437
01:36:51.390 --> 01:36:55.010
Yeah.
And most of the time there'd be still brown back there.

1438
01:36:55.340 --> 01:36:58.580
That's what the big days for Bro.
These are long,

1439
01:36:58.790 --> 01:37:02.430
hot moisty browns where you spend 30 minutes on the toilet,

1440
01:37:02.450 --> 01:37:07.430
you spent half the time wiping you never feel clean.
Yeah.
Just oozing out of you.

1441
01:37:07.730 --> 01:37:11.640
Or would you rather have a dead tooth in your mouth?
Oh fuck that.
Uh,

1442
01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:14.900
that you could not remove.
Fuck that.
The dead.

1443
01:37:14.901 --> 01:37:19.130
Who would be visible to everyone now?
Um,
oh,
it would not be visible.

1444
01:37:19.131 --> 01:37:23.060
It would be like a molar tooth back of your mouth.
It's a Zombie to,

1445
01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:25.400
but it would give you the worst breath.
That's the problem.

1446
01:37:25.401 --> 01:37:28.250
And it would end up eventually to Kang.
The rest of your teeth?
Yeah.

1447
01:37:28.251 --> 01:37:31.040
I mean you described our Brown's basically.
Yeah.
So I live with that.

1448
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:35.030
It's like would you rather live the life you're living now or just have shit

1449
01:37:35.031 --> 01:37:37.530
mouth,
so yeah,
sorry.
It's two of us.

1450
01:37:37.531 --> 01:37:42.470
Giang but we take current Brown situation,
right?

1451
01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:47.030
Oh yeah.
Yeah,
definitely.
Definitely.
Um,

1452
01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:52.100
anything else?
Jeans?
Yeah.
Okay.

1453
01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:55.920
I have one.
And you're,
yeah.
Okay.

1454
01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:01.770
<v 2>Making you laugh.
Yeah.
Hold on though.
Let me think.</v>

1455
01:38:03.150 --> 01:38:05.940
I was the worst.
Oh,
I know.
Okay.
Ready?

1456
01:38:07.780 --> 01:38:11.790
I like this teeth idea though.
So I'm going to kind of tangential off the teeth.

1457
01:38:11.791 --> 01:38:16.590
Would you rather,
are you listening to me?
Have your front tooth missing.

1458
01:38:16.591 --> 01:38:20.910
Just one of your front teeth.
The right one just gone and you can't fix it,

1459
01:38:21.210 --> 01:38:22.043
man.

1460
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:28.430
You're just going to have a front tooth gone for like five years or you're a Dj,

1461
01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:34.590
you get your sweet Dj dad mouth.
I am a DJ.
Yeah,

1462
01:38:35.130 --> 01:38:38.490
but the only music you can play is Garth Brooks.

1463
01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:42.410
I just got to find a way to make it interesting.
You've got to make scars,

1464
01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:45.180
rugs and do Garth Brooks music.
You're like Garth Brooks Dj,

1465
01:38:45.210 --> 01:38:48.870
but you can only play Garth or you have to play some Garth.
No,
no.

1466
01:38:48.990 --> 01:38:50.470
The only music you're allowed your oh,

1467
01:38:50.471 --> 01:38:54.750
catalog as a DJ is everything Garth Brooks,
the fuck is wrong with you.

1468
01:38:58.160 --> 01:38:58.490
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1469
01:38:58.490 --> 01:39:01.910
<v 2>What's his head song?
Is it inertia?
Earliest.
Damn.</v>

1470
01:39:02.990 --> 01:39:05.660
That's not him,
mother.

1471
01:39:06.170 --> 01:39:08.500
I got friends and

1472
01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:13.710
we're the whiskey arts and dance.

1473
01:39:15.710 --> 01:39:20.010
But you're like the cool dad.
Garth Brooks.
Deejayed.
Yeah,

1474
01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:25.030
well the thing is missing,
so I feel about that.

1475
01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:28.880
He'd be like the toothless comic,
the toothless,
retarded comic.
My thing.

1476
01:39:30.230 --> 01:39:34.070
So my DJ appeal would be like,
come to my show.
There's going to be cool stuff.

1477
01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:39.420
<v 0>Yeah.
I think I would take</v>

1478
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:44.000
the toothless retards calmly.
Yeah.

1479
01:39:45.190 --> 01:39:46.630
<v 2>At least I could do what I wanted it to.</v>

1480
01:39:46.660 --> 01:39:48.760
I don't want to fucking plague Garth Brooks,

1481
01:39:48.761 --> 01:39:52.160
but is missing tooth will ruin your life.
First of all.
You get it,

1482
01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:55.400
you lose me.
Okay.

1483
01:39:55.520 --> 01:40:00.220
I lose you for I missing you would take my micro penis but not a missing tooth

1484
01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:03.430
and I have to see your penis a lot of time.
Yeah,
you do.

1485
01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:05.830
You realize how it's going to fuck up your whole world.

1486
01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:10.450
Missing a tooth as a horrible,
it ruins everything.
You're not going on to smile.

1487
01:40:10.630 --> 01:40:13.570
I don't want to look at you.
You're going to stand with career.

1488
01:40:13.571 --> 01:40:15.730
People are going to be like,
it's like I'm missing a fucking put.

1489
01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:20.380
That becomes part of the act that becomes the part of the Ackman and the

1490
01:40:20.381 --> 01:40:23.660
retarded toothless comic.
Gotcha.
Okay.

1491
01:40:23.770 --> 01:40:28.630
Do you ever notice may or mocking you get it.
Do you get it?
You get it?

1492
01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:30.680
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1493
01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:34.460
<v 2>What would you take?
You'd be the Garth Brooks.
Tj,
you're out of your mind.</v>

1494
01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:36.950
You know,
find a way to make that interesting.

1495
01:40:36.980 --> 01:40:41.180
You can mix like you can remix the beats to make them cool loophole.

1496
01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:43.190
There's loopholes are not thinking about Tom.

1497
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:47.880
Uh Wow.
