00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.100
better help provides online counseling services,

10
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.010
which is really something that,
you know,

11
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.520
we've endorsed for our own personal life for a long time.

12
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.031
<v 2>Can we?</v>

13
00:00:53.031 --> 00:00:56.840
I've been in therapy for 10 years and it's been the one thing that's helped me

14
00:00:56.841 --> 00:00:59.150
the most and I recommend it for everybody.

15
00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:01.910
I don't know how people go through life without seeing a therapist.

16
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.260
It's the one investment you should make in yourself for your happiness,
for the,

17
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.830
for your rest of the rest of your life.

18
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.841
<v 0>It's true.</v>

19
00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:12.100
And these are licensed therapists that are available worldwide through multiple

20
00:01:12.101 --> 00:01:16.330
modes of communication,
text,
chat,
video,
phone,
again,

21
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.510
licensed professionals that can work with you.

22
00:01:19.511 --> 00:01:23.000
It's important to note this is not a crisis line.
Uh,

23
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.280
but this is for somebody that wants to engage in ongoing therapy.

24
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.110
It's quite affordable.
And even if you can't afford that,

25
00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:36.700
there is financial aid available.
Uh,
but uh,
you know,

26
00:01:36.701 --> 00:01:41.380
we can't,
we can't endorse or stress enough how much has helped the two of us.

27
00:01:41.381 --> 00:01:46.381
I actually got jealous of how happy and,

28
00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:48.580
and just,
uh,
you know,

29
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.660
content and like you became from going to therapy.

30
00:01:52.661 --> 00:01:55.510
So I started probably,
I don't know,
five,

31
00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:58.540
six years ago and I've been really,

32
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.130
<v 2>yeah,
there have been really happy with it.</v>

33
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.740
The thing is people walk around with a depression,

34
00:02:02.741 --> 00:02:06.250
anxiety and there's no need to suffer.
You can see somebody,

35
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:09.250
you can talk to somebody and better help.com/why?
Mh?

36
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.240
<v 0>Yeah,
it's secure.
It's pervasive.
It's professional.
It's convenient.</v>

37
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.780
Go to better health.com/why and and agency.
If it's right for you.

38
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.200
<v 3>Ooh.</v>

39
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.353
<v 4>Ooh.</v>

40
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.800
Chips
in the fall.
It's in a bowl.

41
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.713
That's a big,

42
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.770
<v 2>big news.
Shit is major right here.
So,
all right.</v>

43
00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:56.430
I've been working on this for a long time,
but it's finally here.

44
00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.850
I can announce that my new tour.
Ah,

45
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.420
take it down.
Tour is coming.
Two weeks.

46
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.540

47
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.150
year.
Um,

48
00:03:15.151 --> 00:03:18.430

that's not a new,

50
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.570
that's not going to be separate from the stuff in January that that's the tour.

51
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.330
But as part of the tour is what you're,
this is called branding.

52
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.850
We're branding it starting in 2019 but yeah,
you're seeing the new hour.

53
00:03:35.851 --> 00:03:39.450

54
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.110

I am not going to list them all.
And by the way,

55
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.880
this is the most fun part of like posting something and explaining it in detail.

56
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.180
Yeah.
There's like a post,

106
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.620
You can infer what face farts are by the try it and the thing called face Bart

107
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.830

113
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.310
All right,
Jean,
let's press play.
Let's get going.
Ready?
Go for it.
Let's do it.

114
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.030
<v 5>This is one of the more bizarre stories we've seen in a very,
very long time.</v>

115
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:29.390
And Gilbert man is accused of duping caregivers and the thinking that he was

116
00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:33.370
special needs.
I've been paying them to change his diaper and bathe him.

117
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:38.060
<v 1>Yes.
Don't bring in one month</v>

118
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.310
we'll go to your mom's house.

119
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.040
<v 2>Yeah,
I love this guy.
Changed my diaper.</v>

120
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.290
Now do you think he was wearing a diaper?

121
00:07:54.291 --> 00:07:57.860
Bef like that's his thing and he's like,
God,
this is so tedious.

122
00:07:57.861 --> 00:08:02.240
Changing these diapers I need,
I need help the caregivers.
I read this article.

123
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:06.110
Well let's,
we'll show you some stuff,
but I'm sure you're great.
Um,

124
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.670
I'll tell you what I read in the article.

125
00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.920
<v 5>Yeah.
Marketing is one of the more bizarre stories that I've reported on.</v>

126
00:08:10.921 --> 00:08:15.650
Police say a grown man who had caregivers help change his diaper and basin

127
00:08:15.651 --> 00:08:19.620
itself really never needed help at all.
What's your full name and date of birth?

128
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.690
Nine Paul and even chocolate.
August 18th,

129
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:24.990
1987 police say this man,

130
00:08:24.991 --> 00:08:29.660
30 year old Paul Machaca pretended to have down syndrome.
Okay.

131
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.200
According to court documents,

132
00:08:31.201 --> 00:08:36.201
he posed as a woman named Amy on a website called [inaudible] dot com looking

133
00:08:36.331 --> 00:08:40.170
for caregivers to change his diaper and bathe him regularly.

134
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.890
A total of three caregivers would end up falling for this scheme.

135
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:48.540
<v 2>Can I ask you something so far?
Where's the harm?
Well,</v>

136
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:53.490
here's the harm.
I mean,
let's just say,
what's the problem here?
Let me,

137
00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:56.790
let's just say like he step for them on pay now,

138
00:08:56.791 --> 00:09:00.270
but he's posing as special needs.
I agree.
Cool.
Where's the harm?
Can't,

139
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:04.440
can't he just be like,
look,
I enjoy wearing a diaper.
I want someone to change.

140
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.840
Do you think it's a fetish?
Is that this is,

141
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:11.690
and he's not going to a dom like ms face forwarder,
right?

142
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.970
He should have gone to,
but at the end of the day,
I mean,

143
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.030
they're just changing his diet.
I and bathing him,
but there,

144
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.160
but that's their real caregivers.
Like at the,

145
00:09:20.161 --> 00:09:24.180
it's a manipulation and it's not cool.
It's not nice.
But,

146
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.910
but he posed as somebody named Amy,
I think that's,
no.
So Amy,
Amy,

147
00:09:29.911 --> 00:09:34.380
I think was the online thing where he was like,
I'm,
I'm Amy.
Can you help?

148
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.920
You know,
Chris or whatever.
Oh,
he's a character.
He's a character.

149
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.050
Special Ed needs special,
especially needs

150
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:48.680
needs.
I don't know.
Don't understand the f phase.

151
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.500
A fart is the same eh,

152
00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.560
<v 5>Healy document state.</v>

153
00:09:53.561 --> 00:09:57.010
The caregiver's became suspicious when he aggressively would date.

154
00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.500
He needed to be cleaned to better in certain areas.
Okay.

155
00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:07.310
<v 2>Erica,
I need to get cleaned better down there down there.</v>

156
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.830
That there's always a pervy angle with dudes.
Yeah,
of course.
Always.

157
00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:15.350
Always are so nasty.
No limits to how far we will go.

158
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.160
Why are,
what's the difference between nasty,
why aren't you guys as nasty?

159
00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.000
Because we don't,
because you guys are in the power position in society.

160
00:10:23.001 --> 00:10:26.600
You guys are the ones who can rape and kill and torture.

161
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.720
But then were the ones that are submissive because of our physical strength.

162
00:10:29.721 --> 00:10:31.880
I think that's,
what does that have to do with,

163
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:36.260
why is it that you like you can manipulate me,
right?

164
00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:37.730
Like if I don't give you what you want,

165
00:10:37.731 --> 00:10:41.440
you can forcibly haul me down and hurt me.
Jesus.

166
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.070
So like that's why you fuck with people.
It's a power thing.
But wait,

167
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.710
why does Louie CK jerk off in front of people?
Do you know what I'm saying?

168
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.930
It's a power thing.
So this guy is just flexing his power.
Yeah.

169
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.400
Instead of just clean me better downstairs

170
00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.510
and that.
But he asks that you have to do it special needs,

171
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:04.230
you have to do it more.
Better is dirty still there.
You

172
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.500
had to do like Forrest Gump.
Mom,

173
00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:13.530
Mama said that if you have a dirty chocolate backside then you can't sit for

174
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:17.360
dinner and supper.
That Mama made right?

175
00:11:17.361 --> 00:11:21.770
Like this guy was basically doing a Forrest Gump impression the whole time.

176
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.000
So I mean,

177
00:11:23.001 --> 00:11:25.370
do you think like he would drop character or sometimes and they're like,

178
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.410
wait a minute.
Oh,
I'm sure they were like,
hm,
you're not specialty probably.
Yeah.

179
00:11:30.411 --> 00:11:33.590
The article I read was that they were bathing him,
uh,

180
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:38.090
that all three caregivers were like every,
uh,
bathing.

181
00:11:38.091 --> 00:11:41.810
He had an erection for green bay.
It's weird.

182
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.960
You mean this guy is just not a straight up needs a diaper change.

183
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.340
<v 5>The report says one care giver fallen men chocolate and knocked on the front</v>

184
00:11:49.341 --> 00:11:50.330
door.
At date,

185
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:55.510
she was greeted by his parents who later to police their son does not have down

186
00:11:55.511 --> 00:11:59.800
syndrome and did not need assistance with bathing or using the restroom.

187
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:02.780
<v 2>They had to confirm it with the parents.
That's pretty funny.</v>

188
00:12:02.781 --> 00:12:07.520
I've been washing your son's nuts and uh,

189
00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.970
these nuts saying f g t o r t e d

190
00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:18.040
<v 5>but this is what men Chalkah said to the judge and my mom has paper and my mom</v>

191
00:12:18.951 --> 00:12:21.810
and dad both have paperwork to put that.
Oh,

192
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:22.970
<v 2>okay.</v>

193
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:27.710
<v 5>I'm starting to talk to my dad about getting me some help and gave me into a</v>

194
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.553
counselor.

195
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.150
<v 2>But he does have a low Iq.
Does that not qualify?
I know,</v>

196
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.790
I think just the way that he even stated that shows his Iq is too high.
Oh,

197
00:12:36.791 --> 00:12:40.260
it to be low Iq.
Oh,
you mean like if you know you have no,

198
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.970
I'm not saying you can't.
Like if you had a low Iq you could,

199
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.440
you could be aware of it,

200
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:49.030
but I just feel like he has too much awareness to low Iq as he's claiming.

201
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:54.130
You know,
you know after I delivered Julian,
you have a low Iq.

202
00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.570
I had a such low Iq.

203
00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:01.060
This nice nurse washed my virgin for me and she did not like it up,

204
00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:06.300
but it was one of the most wonderful.
Thanks.
Yeah,

205
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:10.000
once I got over the humiliation,
the embarrassment of it,
I was like,

206
00:13:10.001 --> 00:13:13.180
I could get used to this having it cleaned,
someone else doing it.

207
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:18.160
I would love for someone to come and wash my backside and put a die die on you.

208
00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.710
That'd be great.
I don't know if I want to shit in my diaper though.

209
00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.890
This guy does.
I know.
That's really,
really good.
I love it.

210
00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.400
You got to love the game.
You gotta love the diaper game.

211
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:32.380
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't mind paying in a diaper,

212
00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.660
but I think you're right.
Browns are like,

213
00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:39.490
isn't it mashes up against you and everything?
Yeah,
bad.

214
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.190
But I still would like the sponge bath.
Yeah.

215
00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:47.440
And then I go watch more down there and needs more.

216
00:13:47.441 --> 00:13:51.430
So you need to make it more clean.
It's still dirty down there.

217
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.420
And then I just look to the side.
It's still dirty.

218
00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:01.660
And she goes,
I think it's clean now.
I go,
no,
it's still dirty.

219
00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:05.583
Yeah,
like that

220
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:11.420
<v 5>one of the victims also spoke out.
It has affected my work as well.</v>

221
00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:15.470
I've actually missed work for that and I think that it should be held with

222
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.250
either a substantial bond amount or where he would not be released until the

223
00:14:19.251 --> 00:14:22.790
next court date because I have fear for my safety in regards to that as well as

224
00:14:22.791 --> 00:14:25.700
my family and friends because I didn't bring my family and friends around him.

225
00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:30.520
<v 2>Oh,
so now it's actually worse than,
I mean those caregivers are so vulnerable.</v>

226
00:14:30.521 --> 00:14:33.250
Like these people are angels that do work like this,

227
00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:37.000
that show up at some stranger's house there at totally in the vulnerable

228
00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:39.250
position here.
Like my goodness,

229
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:44.650
this poor woman touched my booboo,

230
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.200
<v 5>knocked on the door to see if the family would speak with us.</v>

231
00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.740
You didn't answer.
Oh no kidding.

232
00:14:52.741 --> 00:14:56.060
And chaga faces 10 counts of sexual abuse charges.

233
00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.300
He'll be back in court on September 17th the morning live.

234
00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:00.650
Courtney Griffin box 10 news.

235
00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.460
<v 2>They didn't want seeing 10 counts and that's a lot.</v>

236
00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:07.240
I thought he was just facing like a posing,
you know,

237
00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.730
as a special needs person know.
Just like,
uh,
I don't know.

238
00:15:09.731 --> 00:15:13.630
Some type of impersonation charge.
I didn't realize it was it's abuse though,

239
00:15:13.631 --> 00:15:14.650
to make these women,

240
00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:19.550
I'm assuming bookies face by face mark.

241
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.630
Let living explain.
Oh,
I put a spot.
Yeah.
I kept this,

242
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.500
uh,
Ooh.

243
00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:34.180
This is,
this was in the,
uh,
uh,

244
00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:38.050
on,
on the,
on the television.
Yeah.

245
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.880
<v 6>You're going down the third base.
Nice blame Machado.</v>

246
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:43.760
Liverpool soon retarded.

247
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:49.640
<v 2>Oh yeah.
I know the Albert who holds a comedy.
Yeah.</v>

248
00:15:49.641 --> 00:15:53.600
Pools are worded.
That's what it sounded.
When I say it sounds like

249
00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:56.173
<v 6>retarded.</v>

250
00:15:56.710 --> 00:16:01.150
<v 2>I mean,
what the things it sounds like they should,
the focus on,</v>

251
00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:05.440
well,
there's,
man,
there needs to be outraged.
We have to get that man fire.

252
00:16:05.441 --> 00:16:07.840
Dare you say he's Dominican.
You don't call them are worded.

253
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:12.640
What does that have to do with his,
yeah,
he's still a baseball player.

254
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.860
Treat him with respect.
Jesus.

255
00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:16.360
<v 6>Cool.
Sounds retarded.</v>

256
00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:23.580
<v 2>Gosh,
super disrespectful.
Yeah.
How old is Albert Poo holes now?
For Real?</v>

257
00:16:23.581 --> 00:16:26.190
He's been around a minute,
right?
Yeah.
He was close to my age,

258
00:16:26.191 --> 00:16:29.070
so he's probably 63 now.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

259
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.260
The what show was it?

260
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.740
I wanted to watch with you last night and you said it wrong.

261
00:16:34.741 --> 00:16:39.660
I've been making funny all day.
Oh,
sharp objects.
I see the shirt.
You go,

262
00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:43.930
are we going to watch the sharp objects?
I'm like,
not these jobs.
Then I started,

263
00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.260
you didn't catch what?
I started doing nerd.

264
00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.620
I started looking at other titles and I said the in front of all of them,

265
00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:56.110
of course.
How many titles has been,

266
00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:58.350
Gosh,
you want to finish the Ozarks?

267
00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.110
Oh my God.
I have not.
I still,

268
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.700
do you ever feel like with certain,

269
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:10.170
especially because we work in comedy and were comedians and we,
you know,

270
00:17:10.171 --> 00:17:12.000
we're just around it all the time.

271
00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:17.670
You forget how funny some you take it for granted because they'd been around for

272
00:17:17.671 --> 00:17:21.840
a minute.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
How talented,
how funny some people are.
Yeah.

273
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:25.330
Where you go,
somebody brings them up.
You're like,
yeah,
you know?
Of course,
yeah,

274
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:29.890
they're awesome,
but then you're like,
whatever.
Because it's,
it's like it's,

275
00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:35.120
it's in your head that they'd been around you watching your own specialist again

276
00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.350
and you're like,
I'm blown away by me.
No,

277
00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.010
I am blown away by Sasha Baron Cohen.
Oh,
Mike me.

278
00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:46.140
I was thinking the same thing.
You forget how fucking talented that guy is.
Guy.

279
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:50.220
We finally got to starting who is America?
Oh my God,

280
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:55.460
who is America showtime series that came out earlier this year actually I ran

281
00:17:55.651 --> 00:18:00.651
into Metzker Kurt Metzger a couple of weeks ago at the store and he's a writer

282
00:18:01.231 --> 00:18:04.200
on on this.
I saw his name on the credits and we were talking briefly,

283
00:18:04.201 --> 00:18:06.300
but he's like,
oh,
you haven't seen it?
I go,
no.
He was like,

284
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:10.500
and it I think is actually what prompted me to finally do it because he's so

285
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:15.590
Kurt so funny that when he said like I could tell how much joy he got from

286
00:18:16.321 --> 00:18:19.680
working on and seeing the show,
I was like,
I got to check this out.

287
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:24.950
I have laughed harder watching four episodes of that so far than anything I can

288
00:18:26.101 --> 00:18:30.690
recall in the last couple of years.
Yeah.
That's how funny that guy has to me.

289
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.600
He's amazing.
He does these other characters for those of you don't know who,

290
00:18:33.601 --> 00:18:34.620
so I should bear in is,

291
00:18:34.621 --> 00:18:39.621
he's the guy that did Ali g and Bruno and Borat and the dictator.

292
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:40.290
I mean,

293
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.470
and then he's doing one or who was America and he's got these great characters.

294
00:18:43.471 --> 00:18:47.940
One is a left wing NPR,
ultra liberal.
He's like,

295
00:18:47.941 --> 00:18:50.760
I'm a privileged white male.
He says,

296
00:18:50.761 --> 00:18:55.240
I think the most dangerous chemical in the world is testosterone and then has

297
00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.070
like a big pot belly and he has a ponytail and he,
you know,

298
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.250
he goes around interviewing conservative people.
It's this stuff.

299
00:19:02.251 --> 00:19:06.080
And then he's got like ultra conservative sectors.
God,

300
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:11.490
he's trying to take back the word pedophile.
He's like,
ah,
because I love kids.

301
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.720
So I'm proud to call myself one.
And these guys like,
no,
yeah,
yeah,

302
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.620
let's reclaim that word.
And he's like,
you're a pedophile to,
and the guys like,

303
00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:23.250
stop saying that.
But he has so many great,

304
00:19:23.251 --> 00:19:27.960
he has a an like an Alex Jones like character where the uh,

305
00:19:27.961 --> 00:19:32.961
the thing says library truth Berry and that's [inaudible] dot org and he has

306
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.330
these nutty conspiracy theories.
Yeah.
Um,

307
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:41.400
then he has that Israeli um,
sorry.
Yeah.
Terrorist training.

308
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:46.380
So,
but like the scenarios are so ridiculous,
but he's just so fucking funny man.

309
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:51.540
Scary too is that he finds actual politicians and he fucks with them and you see

310
00:19:51.541 --> 00:19:53.580
how super are awarded.

311
00:19:53.581 --> 00:19:57.140
A lot of our representatives are in government.
Yeah.

312
00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:02.280
Terrifying.
How they are not like one of them takes,

313
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:07.340
it takes no encouragement for him to just shout the end word like yeah.

314
00:20:07.421 --> 00:20:10.560
With television cameras rolling and dope and he ran,
he had to retire.

315
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:14.830
He had to resign after this.
Yeah,
I know.
Yeah.
Yeah.

316
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:20.010
Crazy.
Screaming it.
Yeah.
It's,
it's fantastic.
Is it showtime or Hbo?
Showtime.

317
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.890
Showtime.
Sasha Baron Cohen.
He's his,

318
00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:27.810
he's married to a funny lady to what's her name is Amy.
No,
I left Fisher.
Fisher.

319
00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:32.580
She's finding too,
yeah,
she is calm.
Many people get married.
Yeah.
It's great.

320
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.590
I don't,
but it's cool.
He's a,

321
00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.920
he is so funny and I cannot endorse that show enough.

322
00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.170
I don't know if that shows getting enough credit and I don't think,

323
00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.980
I think part of it too is there like it's Sacha Baron Cohen.

324
00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.400
Like some people are just like,
oh that guy who does think,

325
00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:49.930
but you see what he's doing in this and it's,
it's so fucking it.

326
00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.170
Do you feel like he's,
he's bitten Ben kind of written off in a way.
And I,

327
00:20:53.171 --> 00:20:57.120
that's what I'm saying is in movies or don't they do well then the dictator do

328
00:20:57.121 --> 00:20:59.110
well or,
I don't know why I did fair.

329
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:03.750
I think it was probably in comparison to Tibor at which crushed the box off

330
00:21:03.751 --> 00:21:05.110
where I was amazed.
They always,
you know,

331
00:21:05.111 --> 00:21:09.840
you're always weighed upon like what your last movie did.
Yeah.
And,
and I,

332
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.910
I bet you it's hard to do the show because so many people recognize him for
sure.

333
00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:17.020
That's why he's in like incredible prosthetics.
Really good for the show.

334
00:21:17.021 --> 00:21:20.260
I was like,
damn,
I wouldn't,
well they probably spend a day getting him into each,

335
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:23.920
you know,
could you imagine?
Oh my God,
what a nightmare when he goes to,

336
00:21:23.921 --> 00:21:28.921
he goes to some kind of rural town in Arizona and he tells me he's got great

337
00:21:29.861 --> 00:21:34.360
news that the world's or did you like the second biggest mosque in the world?

338
00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:35.693
In their town.

339
00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:41.340
But the funny thing is that also people do not care to hide who they are.

340
00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:47.290
Yeah.
With cameras there.
No like,
what the fuck?
We don't want a mosque here.

341
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.690
He's like,
no,
it's going to be great.
It's gonna be like a first class mosque.

342
00:21:51.691 --> 00:21:54.040
And they were like,
we don't give a shit.
And then,
and then he's like,

343
00:21:54.041 --> 00:21:56.560
here's a look at the future of what it's going to be like on your streets.

344
00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:57.890
And it's like,
you know,

345
00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:02.620
men walking their camels everywhere wearing those robes.

346
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.620
I don't know what the male version of things are written.
And it's all in Arabic.

347
00:22:05.621 --> 00:22:09.100
Arabic.
So funny.
And they're so pissed.
Yes.

348
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:13.350
What's really interesting is a revealing,
um,

349
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:17.380
just how racist Americans are against Middle Easterners and Muslims.

350
00:22:17.381 --> 00:22:20.090
So it's like every other segment of that,
of that shit.

351
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:25.000
Every other segment you're like,
wow,
everyone's really racist.
Yeah.

352
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:28.840
It's a good show.
Yeah,
it's pretty,
pretty great,
man.
He's great.
Now,

353
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:32.110
have you been watching a new murder show or as I like to say,

354
00:22:32.111 --> 00:22:36.130
studying for the future?
No doubt about it.
Yeah.

355
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:40.910
You finish Ozark on behind.
Yeah,
I finished it.
It's great.
Goddammit.

356
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:44.620
I,
I'm so,
what are you watching it?
What's the new serial killer lineup?

357
00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:49.210
They're not,
I'm actually getting into some spiritual stuff.
Good.
No,
I am.

358
00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:53.290
I am.
I'm trying to get in touch with that other side.

359
00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.570
I found this pastor that I'm really into.

360
00:22:56.110 --> 00:23:00.390
<v 7>Oh.
Should knock on Amazon.
How you pass the incursion.
Real world problems.</v>

361
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.940
We're definitely living in La as a bitch.
Let me tell you something.

362
00:23:03.941 --> 00:23:06.910
You must be a bitch like showing yes,
I cost.

363
00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:11.040
I'm the counseling pastor while y'all motherfucking pastor ain't doing a gut.
No,

364
00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:11.883
I'm good.

365
00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.390
<v 2>Okay.
I like him already.
See that's why I'm into him.</v>

366
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:19.520
<v 7>I'm the cousin pastor that use my platform to raise $6,000 father's mother who</v>

367
00:23:20.941 --> 00:23:24.570
was going through a place where these other equally as none functioning as

368
00:23:24.571 --> 00:23:28.810
vassals wasn't doing.
I'm motherfucking thing in this city right now.

369
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:33.960
That bothers you that I'm a constant hassle then get your motherfucking head off

370
00:23:33.961 --> 00:23:38.820
my damn page.
Plaintiff.
Damn simple.
See,
I don't play.
It's about being real.

371
00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:42.080
It's about the truth and I don't give a damn.
You bitches.

372
00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:46.160
You Hoe ass Nigga Zealand.
Yeah,
lot

373
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.250
<v 2>of.
I love it.
A lot of pastors don't talk like it,</v>

374
00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.220
but I liked that he talks like this.
I mean,

375
00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:55.040
does it say in the Bible you can't curse?
Does it say that shit?

376
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:58.880
I don't think it says Ho ass n word.
No,
but it doesn't say you can't curse.

377
00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:03.500
God never said thou shalt not curse.
That's not one of the commandments.
True.

378
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:07.940
God is real.
God is real.
God blesses.
Blesses.
What Tom?

379
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:11.060
Well you mean to find a no,
please.

380
00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:17.040
<v 7>Ah,
it was a different time when we could record that.
Tell him the truth.</v>

381
00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:19.890
Just like it was soap,
Mitch,
but Oh,

382
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:24.370
I'm going to pick you up so you don't have to worry about the wrong thing.

383
00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:28.320
Yes,
I curse Jesus.
Probably curse.
That's right.

384
00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.960
Just to be sitting there looking at you.
[inaudible] name's nick roses in,
damn,

385
00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:33.003
I made that.

386
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:36.350
<v 2>I love him.
I kind of,
what can I tell you?</v>

387
00:24:36.351 --> 00:24:39.980
Because there is this misconception that this language thing is silly.

388
00:24:39.981 --> 00:24:44.210
It's silly that people who don't curse are better or more moral than people that

389
00:24:44.211 --> 00:24:48.320
do curse.
It's just,
it's nonsense.
Your morality has nothing to do,
right?

390
00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:51.290
No.
So silly.
There are great people,

391
00:24:51.291 --> 00:24:56.180
like we always have this thing about in comedy,
the scariest comics.
Yeah.

392
00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:00.420
Are the ones who are squeaky clean.
Oh,
right.
Look at Bill Cosby,

393
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:03.800
the psycho number one.
Ah,
yeah.

394
00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:09.890
And this thing and little low.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No,

395
00:25:09.891 --> 00:25:14.480
it's true.
And it's true.
He's the biggest asshole of a mall for sure.

396
00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:18.710
Yeah.
He's a serial rapist,
but yeah,
but it's,

397
00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:21.170
it is true clean and that he's very clean.

398
00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:26.380
And then these really deprived acts that say the nastiest Valvia things usually.

399
00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:30.130
Usually the sweetest.
Yeah.

400
00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:34.580
Most trustworthy look approachable people.
Dave Attell.
Yeah,

401
00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:38.300
I'd say a little sweetheart.
And one of the Nastier,
nastier acts,

402
00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.890
you gotta be so nasty.
The one of the nicest human beings alive.
Yeah.

403
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:47.390
I'm trying to think who else is nasty.
So nasty,
so nasty.

404
00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.470
You're kind of nasty.
I'm a little nasty.

405
00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.800
People would say that you and I are kind of nasty,
but I'm a sweet boy.

406
00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.460
Were the nicest people.
I'm a sweet boy or the nicest.
Yeah,

407
00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:03.260
I'm way nice or the new.
I'm the Nice Champ.
You are the nice champ.

408
00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:08.090
You just gave that to me like that.
You could take nice.
Really.
I think,

409
00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.420
I think people would disagree if they met us.
That's not true.

410
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.690
People approach me all the time.
They're always nice to them.

411
00:26:14.691 --> 00:26:17.750
I'm never not nice to people who approach me really.

412
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:21.500
Of course you're but you're not.
You're a little standoffish.

413
00:26:21.501 --> 00:26:25.760
I don't think I'm staying off it.
I'm saying I'm not going out there like hello.

414
00:26:25.761 --> 00:26:30.530
You wreck it like I'm not that.
I'm not soliciting.
Not I'm not.
Yeah.
No,

415
00:26:30.531 --> 00:26:33.440
I don't.
I don't solicit it now.
I know what I'm saying.
I I don't.

416
00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:38.270
I'm saying if anyone ever approaches me,
I always am really nice.
So Am I.

417
00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:42.280
Yeah.
I'm the manners champ though.
I've better manners than you knew.
No,

418
00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.900
that's not true.
That's not true.
It's just out of ignorance,

419
00:26:45.901 --> 00:26:48.810
so I'm just not as classy.
I wasn't raised as classy.

420
00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:53.400
He would at least tip your hat and my way for that.
You're like the,
I mean,
yeah.

421
00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.100
Yeah,
I would say that you're like the decorum champ.

422
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.570
Like you know how to act right.

423
00:26:58.050 --> 00:26:59.880
I don't know how to act right and a lot of situations,

424
00:26:59.881 --> 00:27:01.980
but that's just cause I was raised like a fucking animal.

425
00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.220
I've told you in certain situations,
what are you doing right now?

426
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:09.660
You got it all right.
All right.
Or sometimes I'll ask you,

427
00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:13.650
I'll ask you like how do I act normal?
Like what?
What do normal,

428
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.460
what would a normal person do here?
But you've helped me.
Yeah.

429
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:18.900
I was just telling somebody the other day,
like you,

430
00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:22.740
you made me a normal human being.
You kind of,

431
00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:25.080
you taught me how to be American and civilized.

432
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:28.650
I was a Hungarian wild dog before.
Yeah.

433
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:33.110
And now no fucking lady.
I'm a mom.
Yeah,
mom.

434
00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:37.170
Mother of two.
Um,
this just came in and I haven't read it,

435
00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:41.940
but I know Tom is bad is right.
No,
no,

436
00:27:41.941 --> 00:27:44.910
I think you're going to like it.
Look,
you can read it.
I haven't read it,

437
00:27:44.911 --> 00:27:48.390
but I just started reading on my damn glasses.
I forgot them.
Okay.

438
00:27:48.391 --> 00:27:52.110
Tom Is not right or die is the subject to high mommies.

439
00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:56.460
I was watching episode 40 65 and you were discussing whether Christina was a

440
00:27:56.461 --> 00:27:59.730
true writer die if she would turn Tom informed murder.

441
00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:03.900
I was later discussing this with my boyfriend and he brought up a very

442
00:28:03.901 --> 00:28:05.700
interesting point.
Tom,

443
00:28:05.701 --> 00:28:09.240
is the true betrayer of the ride or die relationship.

444
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:13.890
This is because Christina said she would only turn Tom in for a premeditated

445
00:28:13.891 --> 00:28:15.360
killing and in this scenario,

446
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.860
Tom is the first one to betray the relationship loyalty because he did not

447
00:28:19.861 --> 00:28:22.260
disclose the planning of the murder.

448
00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.470
As we know from all of Tom Psycho murder shows,

449
00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:29.850
all premeditated killings involve a planning phase.
Therefore,

450
00:28:29.851 --> 00:28:34.290
upon Tom Planning to kill a Barista that got his Venti iced coffee,

451
00:28:34.291 --> 00:28:38.670
extra ice with a splash of soy order wrong.
Oh,
this guy got it wrong.

452
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:44.400
He would tell Christina his plant if he was a true writer,
die.
Therefore,

453
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.580
Tom,
Yana is not a true right,
a dye.
So Christina,
what not?

454
00:28:48.581 --> 00:28:51.120
I'd have to maintain her ride or die status after the murder and,

455
00:28:51.121 --> 00:28:54.390
and can turn him and absolutely love your podcast.

456
00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:59.130
Give to my end tight piss on me.
Beat me.
Rub,
rub,
rub Shelby from Canada.
Um,
oh,

457
00:28:59.131 --> 00:29:02.460
thank you.
Shelby from camp.
Here's,
let's discuss for real.

458
00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:03.630
Have an interesting point.

459
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:08.430
I guess we're kind of conflating though different scenarios today.
The word,
well,

460
00:29:08.431 --> 00:29:11.650
I'm saying so there could be the idea that I'm a,

461
00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:15.690
I have a premade premeditated planned.
Yes.

462
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:20.520
That usually would take place.
There'd be like the stocking period lying in.

463
00:29:20.521 --> 00:29:23.490
Wait.
Okay,
so that's one scenario.

464
00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:26.670
There's also this scenario where I see the Barista,

465
00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:31.010
so it's not necessarily preplanned,
it's more of a passion now,

466
00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:35.120
but I told you in that case I might help you out because it's a,
it's a,

467
00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.020
you fucked up in the moment.
Correct.

468
00:29:37.021 --> 00:29:40.050
And I would take mercy on your soul and I would go,
all right,

469
00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:44.920
let's figure this shit out because we got kids.
However,
Yana yeah,

470
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:49.510
I would probably still have to leave because if you're capable of that kind of

471
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.110
crime of passion with a Barista,
I'm going to be next or the children.

472
00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:57.340
So I'd help you get rid of the body and then I leave Ya.
Yeah,
but premeditation.

473
00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:00.850
I'm calling cops nine one one bro.
You're done.

474
00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:02.620
Well because you're out of your fucking mind.

475
00:30:02.621 --> 00:30:04.630
You need to be taken off the streets.
Yeah,

476
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:10.200
I guess I would say it's safe to say that your not an f g t r e d because the

477
00:30:13.871 --> 00:30:14.411
real,

478
00:30:14.411 --> 00:30:18.250
for those of you who have been playing this game all along and we're wondering

479
00:30:18.251 --> 00:30:22.600
and guessing,
what does it mean?
We finally can tell you.

480
00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:27.900
It means for girls that ride till death and there's a very limited number of FTD

481
00:30:29.921 --> 00:30:34.870
RTDs out there,
uh,
for girls that ride till death and here,
oh,

482
00:30:34.871 --> 00:30:39.070
you have your one l here,
but it's correct in the shirt,

483
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:44.410
uh,
four girls that ride till death,
women's black tea.
It's for women only.
It's,

484
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:45.880
I think a great gift.

485
00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:50.040
If you're a guy and you want to salute your lady for being a ride or die.
Yeah.

486
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:53.620
You get her,
her very own F,
g t r t t shirt.

487
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.830
Now this is a shirt for the ladies only.
It's ladies only.

488
00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:58.450
So this is a women's cut shirt.

489
00:30:58.451 --> 00:31:01.870
And I'll describe it for those listeners who are not watching us on youtube.

490
00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:06.160
It's got the letters,
F,
g,
T,
r,
t,
d.
And what's that font called?

491
00:31:06.161 --> 00:31:10.240
Kind of a gothic.
It is Kinda Gothic,
kind of Rad Cholo type.

492
00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:14.380
And then it says four girls that ride till death under it with a chain.

493
00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:18.870
It's hard.
Really cool.
Yeah.
I like,
it's kind of golf and I like it.
Yeah.
So,
uh,

494
00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:22.840
get it for your lady.
Get it for yourself.
It's ladies only.
It's,
you know,

495
00:31:22.841 --> 00:31:25.920
you're the ultimate Ftt RTDs you ladies that,
uh,

496
00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:30.960
will stay by your man just because he are you saying I'm not an FTT RTD?

497
00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:35.350
Clearly not clearly not.
Yeah.
Um,

498
00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:40.900
uh,
oh by the way,
do you remember this dude who was like,
Hey,

499
00:31:40.901 --> 00:31:44.800

It was cracking.
And um,
he wants,
you know,

500
00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.480
he wants chicks to,

501
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:51.830
he wants any chick of any race to come to his house.
Yeah,
yeah.

502
00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:57.340
Hey Yo,

Yo,
Yo was cracking much quicker.
Which quacking actor.
Hey listen,

503

that whole thing,
right?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

504
00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:07.890
I was talking about,
we're talking about get wet and I was like,
well,

505
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:11.410
I mean the way I know get wet means PCP.
Uh,

506
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:15.340
Santana was saying dipping a joint in formaldehyde.
Sure.
Okay.

507
00:32:15.341 --> 00:32:18.950
So I always knew as a PCP,
he's a formaldehyde.

508
00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.380
Guess what it actually is for this man.
But it's water.
What?

509
00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:28.270
He loves water.
No,
I swear to you,
I swear to you wonder what the fuck.

510
00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.420
I love you all and you know what?

511
00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:34.900
Water has no color.
None.

512
00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:42.890
<v 9>If you can't low about me doing slam some water,</v>

Look,

518
00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:08.250
this is fucking bullshit.
You know what?

519
00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:12.960
We know somebody else had drinks like that.

522
00:33:18.751 --> 00:33:19.584

523
00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:20.681
<v 9>You don't,</v>

Absolutely.

529
00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:46.570
We should see how much water this guy can really chug.
But this guy cheese is,

530
00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.220
is like super into water.
Where's your water?
I'm just curious.

531
00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:52.330
Are you hydrating today Tom?
I'm pretty damn sure.

535

Boom headed up man.
Top in space.

But I'm going to do it.
Okay.

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:13.880
See

537
00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:17.300
<v 2>He's all about his water.
That's what I'm saying.
So weird.</v>

538
00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:22.190
We've got to reach out to him,
I guess,
but I feel like he's stealing my role.

539
00:34:22.191 --> 00:34:26.930
My Thunder.
Yeah.
I'm the water champ.
Did you know that?
That's bullshit.
No,

540
00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:30.710
I've been drinking.
Guys.
Watch these past episodes on Youtube.

541
00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:35.210
How many times do you ever see Tom Dry?
Give you a moment in time.

542
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:39.800
A moment.
That's all I give you.
I'm going to have blue band splice together.

543
00:34:39.801 --> 00:34:42.170
How I've been drinking so much water.
And you'll ask,

544
00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:44.750
but what I'm saying is you get a little bit while you're,

545
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:49.340
while we're filming this,
there's not cameras rolling.
24 seven on us.
Oh my God.

546
00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:52.400
By my bedside.
How many bottles of water are there right now?

547
00:34:54.410 --> 00:34:57.010
Like this one?
No,
like for,

548
00:34:57.430 --> 00:35:01.690
I've actually really been somebody who tries to get my friends to invest more.

549
00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:05.950
Yeah.
I can't believe how little some of my friends think about it.

550
00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.370
Yeah,
it is true.
You should start thinking about it and,

551
00:35:09.371 --> 00:35:12.790
and kind of earlier in life.
Better earlier than later.
Of course.
Why not?

552
00:35:12.791 --> 00:35:16.000
Start now,
dude.
You don't have to have a lot of money to do it.

553
00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:20.260
You just got to start doing it.
Yeah,
exactly.
Hey,
that looks really good on you.

554
00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:24.520
Thanks.
You Teddy fresh.
Yeah.
Do you know the pink looks really good on you?

555
00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:28.750
Does it dude?
Real men wear pink.
I know.
Cameron does.
You look,

556
00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:33.430
it looks actually really flattering on your skin tone.
Pretty Blue Eyes.

557
00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:38.460
Maybe there's a new thing coming that I'm going to tell you later.

558
00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:42.780
Okay.
Hey,
did I,
uh,
did you read that thing that,
um,

559
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:46.530
burden Ernie from sesame street?
Did you hear that?

560
00:35:46.531 --> 00:35:50.700
Think that like that were,
I'm new here or something.

561
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:53.920
Do you think that I don't work

562
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:58.520
<v 11>here?
I don't know.
Oh,
okay.
Well,
I mean,
I'd be happy to do that.
I mean,</v>

563
00:35:58.521 --> 00:36:00.860
that's what friends are for,
aren't they okay with their friends?

564
00:36:00.861 --> 00:36:03.080
His nose is back on,
right?
Okay,
sure.

565
00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:08.450
We know we done
hold on.

566
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:14.790
Can,
I don't think that's quite all right.
I look at that.

567
00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:18.080
Look at that.
Bird will tell the folks what a actually happened this past.

568
00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:22.200
<v 2>So it,
it came to one of the writers,
I believe,
of sesame street,</v>

569
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:26.790
said that burden Ernie are in fact a gay couple.
And that yes,

570
00:36:26.791 --> 00:36:29.280
everybody's suspicions for years that they were gay.
Well,

571
00:36:29.281 --> 00:36:33.600
he said that he wrote on the show for years and he said that he always based

572
00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:37.040
writing them on his own relationship with his partner.
Oh,

573
00:36:37.041 --> 00:36:40.440
I didn't even know that.
That's like a,
I used to always think he goes,

574
00:36:40.441 --> 00:36:44.010
I just thought of them the way I thought of myself and my partner.

575
00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:49.800
And then sesame street came out and was like,
no,
like,
no,
it's not.
Yeah,

576
00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:52.740
they were like,
they're just friends.
Yeah.
But I don't know.

577
00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:54.560
This is the guy who he's,

578
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:58.680
he obviously is saying as somebody who was writing week to week on this show.

579
00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:01.290
Yeah.
That's how I envision it.
That's how he wrote for them.

580
00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:04.690
So and so unconsciously or whatever.
They are gay.
Um,

581
00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:08.400
but if you see Burton or Ernie,
they sleep in the same room,
but in separate beds,

582
00:37:08.401 --> 00:37:11.670
like in 1950s couple yeah.
Like Lucy and Ricky,

583
00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:15.390
like they're kind of like a chase to gay couple.
It's Kinda cute.
Here's a,

584
00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:18.210
some more super cute cliff's.
Let me know if you think this is gay.

585
00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:19.323
<v 11>Hey,
Ernie.</v>

586
00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:23.920
Lottery bird weighed 'em man at Ernie.

587
00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:29.440
You are not going to cut my hand.
Rd.
I assure you know what you're doing.

588
00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.440
We bought a bird on your shoulder.
We're pretty close.
We're pretty.
Clip,
clip,

589
00:37:32.441 --> 00:37:37.140
clip.
Just a haircut like a month from my head
the whole month.

590
00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:42.070
What are you gonna do about it?
Oh Wow.
I have just the thing for you.

591
00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:46.210
Just a second.
Oh my hair.
What's it going to do?
There you go.
Bird.
What is that?

592
00:37:46.211 --> 00:37:49.870
A book up.
What?
Make my hair grow faster.
No,

593
00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.940
but it'll give you something to do while you're waiting.

594
00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.480
<v 2>Hmm.
Yeah.
That doesn't feel gay.
Not at all.
I don't know.</v>

595
00:37:57.481 --> 00:38:00.000
These aren't gay examples at all and I don't know why they're in here.

596
00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.250
What about this one?
They're in bed.

597
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:06.820
<v 11>Boy,
you thirsty?
That's gay.
Okay.
Am I thirsty?
Yes.</v>

598
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:09.833
<v 2>Oh,</v>

599
00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:11.560
<v 11>if you're so thirsty,</v>

600
00:38:11.561 --> 00:38:14.920
why don't you just get up and get yourself a glass of water?
Huh?
Well,

601
00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:17.050
because burned.
I'm so tired.
I don't know.

602
00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:20.800
The only thing I am more than tired is thirsty,

603
00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:27.610
thirsty,
worry.

604
00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:31.300
They taste good.
Gee,
what am I

605
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:36.190
thirsty?
Yes sir.

606
00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:44.170
<v 2>So cute.
I do love them so much.
You don't see Bernie that much?
No you don't.</v>

607
00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:48.410
You don't really see them that one.
Cause we watch it
and uh,

608
00:38:48.411 --> 00:38:53.260
our kid likes super Grover 2.0 yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you.

609
00:38:53.261 --> 00:38:56.050
That's good.
They're adorable.
I mean these,
these,
uh,

610
00:38:56.260 --> 00:39:00.220
examples did not really lead me to think that I was anything gay.
No,
I feel like,

611
00:39:00.221 --> 00:39:03.120
okay,
so there's a sense of mystery book we have and they,

612
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:06.970
they do shout outs to them being gay.
I think like for instance,

613
00:39:06.971 --> 00:39:11.310
there's like a panel the open and it's like Bert and Ernie in the closet burden

614
00:39:11.311 --> 00:39:14.950
or any out of that closet one that is the funniest.
I mean,

615
00:39:14.951 --> 00:39:19.600
do they have to know that that's a nod to and being gay for the parents?
I think,

616
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:23.700
yeah.
It's always in the closet.
Like Ernies clothes are in the closet.

617
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:27.680
Burt's in the closet.
They do it all the time.
Yeah.
I see.
I,
I,

618
00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:31.840
maybe I'm reading into it,
but,
oh,
um,
did you see that the member,

619
00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:35.860
we showcased those guys that had the,
uh,

620
00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:40.390
that the put up the picture of Mcdonald's?
Yes.
Mcdonald's found out.

621
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:45.370
Yes.
I read that they gave him $25,000.
Yeah.

622
00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.390
I guess is advertising fees.
I thought it was a good thing.
Yeah.

623
00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:53.410
That's super cool.
Yeah,
it's um,
it's pretty cool.
They,
uh,

624
00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:58.990
they,
I think they went on Ellen and Ellen.
So for those of you don't remember,

625
00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.000
we've featured,
we showed the clip.

626
00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:06.100
These Asian kids notice that there were no portrayals of Asian people happily

627
00:40:06.101 --> 00:40:08.410
eating McDonald's,
buster local Mcdonald logo on.

628
00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:12.730
So they took their own photos and they put on a poster that looked identical to

629
00:40:12.731 --> 00:40:16.540
the other ones that Mcdonald's had and they just slipped it in there and they

630
00:40:16.541 --> 00:40:20.260
made a video they put on youtube and Mcdonald's didn't notice for like weeks and

631
00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.850
weeks until it went viral.
Hilarious.

632
00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:25.270
So now they found out and they gave these kids 25 grand,
which is awesome.

633
00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:29.590
That's a good move on their part if you want to see this.
A crybaby.
Yeah.

634
00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:31.300
Complaining about,
watch.

635
00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.110
<v 12>Oh,
here,
hold on,
hold on.</v>

636
00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:40.960
<v 13>I was flying from the east coast to the west coast as going back to my feet.</v>

637
00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:44.700
I pass by a young man who was looking at porn on it.

638
00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:50.350
<v 2>Oh No,
no.</v>

639
00:40:50.351 --> 00:40:51.310
Time to cry.

640
00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:55.110
<v 13>I went to a local university for college.</v>

641
00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:59.310
Are there is this thing that we started doing where we would go to a,

642
00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:03.810
like an adult store and pick out like the cheesiest porn film,

643
00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:06.660
take it back to the dorm and it was like,
uh,

644
00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:09.330
like a judging competition.

645
00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:14.080
<v 2>Okay.
Okay.
So yeah,
I eat the ass and pussy all the time.
I got nothing.</v>

646
00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:16.840
We used to do that too in college.
My friends and I would watch like,

647
00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:19.870
but sex porn,
like did gay dudes and laugh and stuff.

648
00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:23.470
We can only watch it for like five minutes before you're thoroughly grossed out.

649
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:26.350
Michelle,
we have a career off of what she's talking about.
Oh,
I know what,

650
00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:30.430
what's the problem?
I honestly don't know what the problem is,
right or wrong,

651
00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.670
doing what she did,
judging the,
these people doing it.
I think watching

652
00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:41.100
<v 13>it was so wrong and I knew it and I did it.</v>

653
00:41:41.101 --> 00:41:44.240
Stop watching it or being a part of that.

654
00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.010
I don't want to be other,

655
00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:51.160
<v 2>she's sit there.
It's like there's a bible and crosses all around her.</v>

656
00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.820
I think she had something traumatic happen.
Oh

657
00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:59.850
<v 13>sure.
I look back and I think if only your voice was stronger.</v>

658
00:41:59.851 --> 00:42:01.620
If only you could have said something,

659
00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:04.560
<v 2>what would you have said to them?
Two.
You guys want to all fuck right now.</v>

660
00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:07.470
Wait till it to the guy on the plane watching porn.
No,
no,

661
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.660
they just talk about in college when they rented the video.

662
00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:11.250
What the fuck is a problem here?

663
00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:15.640
<v 13>I take that into,
you know that the situation of the young man on the flight,</v>

664
00:42:15.641 --> 00:42:19.120
because even like 36,000 feet in the air,

665
00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:21.280
he couldn't get away from these images.

666
00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:27.650
<v 2>Oh,
I don't know.
I don't think it's an addiction so much is poor.
Poor manners.</v>

667
00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:31.310
You know,
you don't watch porn on a plane.
Yeah.
That,
that is a problem here.

668
00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:36.410
That is poor manners.
That is,
I,
you know,
it's,
it's just human.

669
00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:40.010
Humans have needs and masturbation is one of those needs,
right?

670
00:42:40.011 --> 00:42:43.580
It's neither here nor there.
Yeah,
it's whatever,
man.

671
00:42:43.581 --> 00:42:46.910
This is cry baby being about that fucking nonsense.

672
00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.920
I know you'd like to fuck my big black hair.

673
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:53.740
<v 13>All of these things are just like rushing over me like until you really see what</v>

674
00:42:53.741 --> 00:42:58.300
I thought I saw it.
I sat down,
I just started praying like,
God,

675
00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:02.680
what do I do?
Should I even do anything?
You know?
Like,
is this my responsibility?

676
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:04.350
Oh boy,
you're fucking short.

677
00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:05.680
<v 2>Can Sag it,</v>

678
00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:14.950
man.
I tell you though,

679
00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:19.810
the big reason I'm not into religion is this nonsense.
Like this is the worst.

680
00:43:19.811 --> 00:43:23.650
Why is sex have to be demonized?
I don't understand is the worst I have.

681
00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:27.970
Why I so push back on this shit so hard now because that was raised in this kind

682
00:43:27.971 --> 00:43:32.650
of culture that I cannot help but laugh and mock this kind of nonsense.

683
00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.113
I mean,

684
00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:36.040
<v 13>and as I was praying,</v>

685
00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:40.940
I really began to feel protective over him,
over the nail kit.

686
00:43:40.941 --> 00:43:45.760
Check it off.
You are God's beloved and most cherished son.

687
00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:50.820
<v 2>That's our,
we'll have you suck his dick.
Do you,</v>

688
00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:55.500
but do you think God is like looking down at the master baders and keeping a

689
00:43:55.501 --> 00:43:59.050
list of who's who of WHO's fucking who of course wrong way.

690
00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:02.920
<v 13>And as he was coming off the plane,
he looked like he was lost.</v>

691
00:44:02.921 --> 00:44:04.730
And so I took that as my opportunity.

692
00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:07.840
If you're looking for baggage claim and he said,
no,

693
00:44:07.841 --> 00:44:10.990
I'm going on to another flight.
And I said,
okay,
hey listen,

694
00:44:10.991 --> 00:44:14.110
I have something to give you.
And now I take my card.

695
00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:17.950
And he took it and kind of just looked at me and quizzes Dively and just looked

696
00:44:17.951 --> 00:44:18.880
at my card and I said,

697
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:22.900
there's some websites and some things on there that I really think would be

698
00:44:22.901 --> 00:44:26.900
beneficial to you.
Oh my God.
To look at it now you can put it in your backpack,

699
00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:30.340
but at some point it'd be great if you look at it and I just want you to know

700
00:44:30.341 --> 00:44:31.950
that you are so much more.

701
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.080
<v 2>Oh my God,
I just take my fucking,</v>

702
00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:40.500
who the fuck are you to judge this guy jerking it on a plane?
Well,

703
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:45.560
that's the thing is that there's always this like this a line that comes out of

704
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:51.460
these people about Joe.
Only God can judge and they're judged.

705
00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:54.300
That's what I'm saying.
It's so hypocritical.
It's always like,

706
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:59.670
only leave judgment to God,
but by the way,
let me ruin your flight today.

707
00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:01.550
They're horrible.

708
00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:05.520
Is there anything worse than getting one of those fucking pamphlets stuck in

709
00:45:05.521 --> 00:45:08.850
your,
you know,
your front yard somewhere in your daily work?
They came yesterday.

710
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:10.180
No,
I know they always continent.

711
00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:15.250
Yesterday I was trying to take a fucking nap and I heard uh,

712
00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:19.590
hey,
wait,
I want to discuss this prayer.
I was like,
no,

713
00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:22.410
get the fuck out of here.
What's your prayers

714
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:25.380
listen and all the problems.

715
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:28.470
Do you think God's got time to worry about who's touching themselves?

716
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.730
I don't know.
I mean he's,
he definitely has a busy schedule.
Yeah.

717
00:45:32.731 --> 00:45:34.270
There's just so many things about how,

718
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:38.220
how much does eyes probably dart when he's like,
like of his secretary is like,

719
00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:43.260
we've got to cover a masturbatory right now.
Wow.
Shit that's going on everywhere.

720
00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:45.540
And I like,
yeah.
And I'm keeping records of everyone.

721
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:49.960
So you can punish them later.
Ah,
here we go.
Yeah.

722
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:53.080
Oh there's so bad.
So many too.

723
00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:57.560
And what about all the people?
The premarital fuckers too?

724
00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:01.030
Yeah.
On a full time Gig for guy.
Yeah.

725
00:46:01.031 --> 00:46:05.250
I mean God just has nothing but just time to yell at these nuts busting

726
00:46:05.251 --> 00:46:08.400
everywhere and God's got to worry about every Jizz,

727
00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:12.480
every piece of jazz.
It's a,
it's a private,
it's a busy world.

728
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:17.880
Kind of wonder where the com is
so weird.

729
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:22.380
Did you see this?
A God doesn't care about come.
No,
I don't think he does.

730
00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:26.250
I think I read a book title.
God doesn't care about come once.

731
00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:31.530
I don't think he's into it.
He's not interested in where,
how you come?

732
00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:34.500
I don't think so.
No,
I think so.
Either what you eat.

733
00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:38.610
That one I never understood either.
God is like pork is terrible.

734
00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:42.060
I hate pork.
If you loved me,

735
00:46:42.061 --> 00:46:46.710
you would never eat bacon there.
Do Fish on Fridays guys.
Well,

736
00:46:46.711 --> 00:46:51.711
like if you actually take the time to look up the reasons why certain cultures

737
00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:56.820
don't eat certain foods,
it's always tied to like the time,

738
00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:00.840
like when food couldn't be preserved,
no refrigeration.

739
00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:04.920
Oh,
that's why.
And then they're like,
yeah,
you know,
thousand years have gone by,

740
00:47:04.921 --> 00:47:09.390
but we're just going to stick to it.
You know what,
why?
Because there's a book.

741
00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:13.860
Okay.
Yeah,
I get it.
Isn't it interesting too,
like with homosexuality,

742
00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:17.030
that was so good.
What were you going to feel?
So yeah,
they,

743
00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:21.120
the Greeks were the biggest,
but fuckers and kid fuckers love to fuck.

744
00:47:21.121 --> 00:47:24.030
They loved it.
They had fuck everybody.
And you know,

745
00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:27.090
the Christians came along and we're like,
no,
but they,
you know,

746
00:47:27.091 --> 00:47:31.360
they've been fucking for centuries people.
Yeah.
And now you're going to be like,

747
00:47:31.361 --> 00:47:36.160
it's wrong.
Okay.
No,
but fucking fucking kids forever.
We've been doing it forever.

748
00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:40.660
I have come all over my face.
Yeah.
I mean the kid fucking,
I don't condone,
but no,

749
00:47:40.661 --> 00:47:44.500
you shouldn't.
The Butt fucking,
who cares?
I think we finally,

750
00:47:44.501 --> 00:47:49.000
I think it actually took the last 25 years and people are Kinda like,
all right,

751
00:47:49.001 --> 00:47:49.960
so bud fuckers,
all right.

752
00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:55.330
I mean it's been a problem for a hundred centuries,
but now they're like,

753
00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:58.360
they're like,
okay,
you guys get above a,
you guys are gonna do this real kiss.

754
00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:03.670
A real cause.
I was both fucking my mom.
It's funny you said that.

755
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:06.030
Here's a real kiss.
It's right there.
It was a real,

756
00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:10.700
because it's just like the gays.
They fucking the butt to Oh fuck.
Ah.

757
00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:14.560
You see this guy,
um,
that passed out had an overdose?
No.

758
00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:17.500
What they tried to do for him on the street,
this is ridiculous.

759
00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:19.760
<v 9>Oh no</v>

760
00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:30.590
<v 2>show.
This dude is oh deed on the side of the,</v>

761
00:48:30.591 --> 00:48:34.400
on the sidewalk and this guy is pouring milk.
Oh dear.
And people are like,

762
00:48:34.401 --> 00:48:38.850
he doesn't need milk.
He needs a God damn ambulance.
You know?
He's like,

763
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:40.590

764
00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.750
He needs an ambulance right now.

765
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:43.790
<v 9>Oh,

She

769
00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:08.360
let her get some time to breathe.
Take a minute to get out and give it some time.

770
00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:10.380
<v 2>Oh,

776
00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:46.460

I don't know.
That felt kind of contrived to me.
Oh,</v>

777
00:49:46.461 --> 00:49:49.190
that guy looks like he did Odie.
They all look like shit,

778
00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:53.820
but I still think it was a bit,
yeah.
Well I saw the low.

779
00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:58.770
That's too bad.
Pre run down here.
I think it's,
I think it's okay.

780
00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:01.850
It was choreographed.
You look so cute in that pink beanie.

781
00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:06.650
I'm all about the pink hat life.
Can I looks good.
Um,

782
00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:11.630
do you think orange is my new color?
Orange is the new pink.
I know.
Yeah.

783
00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:15.710
No,
it does look good.
Actually.
Your whole gear looks fresh.
The fresh dude.
Yeah,

784
00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:18.770
it looks real fresh.
Okay.
Um,

785
00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:24.710
our guests will be here shortly.
Do you want to take a quick break?

786
00:50:24.711 --> 00:50:28.160
It's get a goddamn snack.
All right.
And we'll be right with

787
00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:34.850
<v 14>two guests.
Some nasty,
nasty.
All right,
we're back.</v>

788
00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:39.620
And um,
look,
we did what you said.
We recovered in it.

789
00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:41.150
You said this was an even exchange.

790
00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:46.220
So what you told me,
put the fucking gear on.

791
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:48.080
And so here we did it.
All right.

792
00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:53.090
They're all in on the teddy fresh react to,
I said,
listen,

793
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:56.990
if you don't go head to toe over the top and a teddy fresh,

794
00:50:57.050 --> 00:51:00.720
I'm not coming on the show.
It's all I'm wearing from.
It's so comfortable.

795
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:04.880
I love the colors.
I never wear color on the show.
I'm always wearing black.

796
00:51:04.881 --> 00:51:07.130
So this is very good.
Honestly,

797
00:51:07.131 --> 00:51:11.780
I think doe and over the shoulder style,
like the young black kids are doing.

798
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:15.380
No white kids are doing it.
Are they?
Well,
that's what happens.

799
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:17.420
They'll do it first and then we go,
hey,
that looks good.

800
00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:20.150
I know that's a really natural look for you.

801
00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:26.030
I'm going to be seeing you in a lot of Photoshop.
Yeah.
Um,
no,

802
00:51:26.031 --> 00:51:28.640
I actually love your gear.
I told you that when I first met you guys,

803
00:51:28.641 --> 00:51:31.010
thank you for coming over.
Thank you guys for inviting us.

804
00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:35.870
I was teased because I think after I did your podcast and I talked about it on

805
00:51:35.871 --> 00:51:38.990
this one,
I said I was with a Etha.

806
00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:43.710
I didn't say Ethan and a lot of people make fun of me.
Ether ether.

807
00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:48.020
I think I was thinking of he la and then I stopped saying it.

808
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:49.910
You know what I mean?
I confused the two names.

809
00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:53.690
You didn't think my name was Ethan.
I didn't think it was Ethan.
It just came out.

810
00:51:53.691 --> 00:51:56.150
That thing that came out that way because nobody's named Isa.

811
00:51:57.050 --> 00:51:59.990
That's not a name combination of the two.

812
00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:04.760
I just wanted to come out and say that.
I know your name is Ethan.
Oh yeah,
sure.

813
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.740
Thank you for clarifying that because I was a lot of people.

814
00:52:07.741 --> 00:52:08.990
We've been talking about that.
Yeah,

815
00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:13.010
the whole Etha thing and you're worked up about a lot of people then.
Yeah.

816
00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:16.730
Thank you for clarifying.
So just everybody knows it's ether with an end.

817
00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:22.620
Eli Eli,
I've been saying with a hard age and you can say it both ways,

818
00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:27.680
it's fine.
No,
you're not a door.
Yeah.
Well

819
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:35.900
Doug Betsey's jumping all over.
So Isla his name,

820
00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:40.040
it's like simple but also the hardest thing to say in the world for an American.

821
00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:44.930
Oh yeah.
Like when I first met her in Israel,
it was just like Isla,

822
00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:48.830
like she puts a little twist on it like and I'm like,
oh my God,

823
00:52:48.831 --> 00:52:49.491
how do I say that?

824
00:52:49.491 --> 00:52:52.280
But then when you realize it's just h I l a [inaudible] it's like,

825
00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:56.480
oh it's just Ila.
It's a pretty nice,
I am so excited to me.

826
00:52:56.481 --> 00:53:01.481
Another couple in the comedy podcasting world and you guys like each other.

827
00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:03.980
He love each other.
Most days.

828
00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:09.040
I was telling Ethan that it's really inspiring to see you guys cause you both.

829
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:13.190
You both have your own career and kids and dogs.

830
00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:19.250
You're normal.
You're like cool people.
How you guys are amazing.

831
00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:22.720
You guys are,
there's two married news teams and the tries to,

832
00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:26.800
I know what happens now.
No,

833
00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:30.100
you guys are seriously amazing.
Like,
yeah,
I love,

834
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:34.630
I love everything about you guys.
You know what I love most about you guys,
um,

835
00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:39.510
is your love of Brown talk.
That's Ralph town.
That is all he knows all him.

836
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:45.410
I participate.
I have no problem with it.
He brought it into the table.

837
00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:51.650
What I love about Brown town is why I elected visit there so frequently is that

838
00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:56.640
it's this secret world and not so secret in our lives,

839
00:53:56.641 --> 00:54:00.120
but in most people's lives,
people have their own techniques.

840
00:54:00.121 --> 00:54:01.860
They come from the front,
they come from the back,

841
00:54:02.070 --> 00:54:04.890
they come from the side they use,
but days they have baby wipes.

842
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:10.190
There's a whole wealth of knowledge that we as a society are not building upon.

843
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:14.760
We write books about science,
about math,
about psychology,

844
00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:20.100
hobbies of all sorts and sizes.
But there's no collective knowledge about Brown.

845
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:23.880
And I think that some people do it wrong.
Have you been talking to my dad?

846
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:29.140
This is verbatim.
It has he owned this?
Yes.
Well you've runs in your family.

847
00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:33.180
That's special.
I know.
But he's always like,
well,
people don't talk about it.
So

848
00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:39.730
it's funny too.
It funny,
you know,
I,

849
00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:42.070
I like to say the first time I ever got fingers moving,

850
00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:43.710
my finger slipped through the toilet paper.

851
00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:47.370
So it goes all the way back to the first time I figured my own asshole.

852
00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:51.900
And here's the thing,
it,
it's like,
look,
everybody farts,

853
00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:56.910
everybody makes Dukie right.
And people feel weird about it,

854
00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:58.020
but it happens.

855
00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:02.160
And the truth is it is something that you should kind of talk about more.

856
00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:05.640
And it is funny.
It is funny to see,
they know that all of us,

857
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:10.020
no matter what you look like,
make big,
nasty,
measurable and it's Smelly,

858
00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:11.980
awful.
And it hurts.

859
00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:17.820
My Dad love it.
I was telling him that one time,
I was like,

860
00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:21.720
keep wiping.
You know,
he's keep wiping and what's going on?
He's like,

861
00:55:21.721 --> 00:55:24.600
you need to wipe down buddy,
because you're watching.
Oh,
wipe up.

862
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:27.870
He was telling me that I'm wiping up too much wiped down.
Don't,

863
00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:31.650
don't go in his much.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Like don asks too many questions.

864
00:55:34.070 --> 00:55:36.240
That's about it.
Yeah,
that's right.
You know,

865
00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:41.640
one from a parks and recreation where he says it's like wiping up marker.

866
00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:48.390
Yeah.
It's called the but stamp or the neverending wipe.

867
00:55:48.391 --> 00:55:49.710
We call it that or leaky,

868
00:55:49.711 --> 00:55:54.330
but sometimes I have a problem because I cannot,
I can't leave it.

869
00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:59.370
I need to run the marker dry.
I'm not what kind of guy that it's like,
hey,

870
00:55:59.371 --> 00:56:04.200
it's just one of those days so I gotta get in there.
I'm scooping,
I'm Robyn,

871
00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:06.430
I'm doing whatever it takes because,

872
00:56:06.490 --> 00:56:08.700
and frankly I don't understand these anecdotes.

873
00:56:08.701 --> 00:56:11.700
You hear about these guys that have shits stains on their underwear.

874
00:56:12.370 --> 00:56:17.090
That's people are unacceptable,
man.
They really are the guys.

875
00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:22.050
The person was like,
well that's enough for today.
We can always,

876
00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:23.830
ah,
I'll get home and I'll wash them.

877
00:56:23.831 --> 00:56:27.670
But you got shit literal shit in your underwear.
What the fuck?

878
00:56:27.790 --> 00:56:31.780
I won't even scratch my back like my ass hole itchy asked.

879
00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:35.300
I'll do it over the underwear over and I ever do.

880
00:56:35.301 --> 00:56:39.010
I'm so paranoid about a real itchy asshole having chocolate on there.

881
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:44.430
I will go to a bathroom to get toilet paper to scratch my,
well if my app,

882
00:56:44.550 --> 00:56:46.950
okay,
well if my asshole is ever that itchy,

883
00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:50.520
<v 15>yeah,
yeah.
I'll assume that.
Maybe I didn't wipe it off.</v>

884
00:56:50.521 --> 00:56:51.331
That's my first assumption.

885
00:56:51.331 --> 00:56:53.400
That's why I'll go get toilet paper and see what's going on.

886
00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:57.830
<v 14>There's usually a little residue,
but nothing too bad.
Yeah.</v>

887
00:56:58.090 --> 00:57:00.410
You guys got me thinking about it because you're right.

888
00:57:00.411 --> 00:57:05.030
When it's the marker scenario,
like who's that lazy person that's like,
I'm good.

889
00:57:05.031 --> 00:57:09.310
Whatever.
Whatever happens today.
Some guy,
that's crazy.
It's insane.

890
00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:14.360
People also don't look up the,
they don't look at the paper.
Good point.

891
00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:17.320
People are,
of course,
every time.
Look,

892
00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:21.950
every time I look on the first one,
it's like,
you know their shit though.

893
00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:26.840
I look,
I look at the paper every time.
Yeah.
Yeah,
but you don't look at the bull.

894
00:57:26.841 --> 00:57:30.940
You said,
I never look at the bowl.
I got to see it all the way through.

895
00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:33.760
I already know.
I know.
It's like blah,
blah.
My,

896
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:37.110
I'm like looking at are you interested?
Not really.

897
00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:41.780
There's a lot of information about,
yeah,
what's going on.
I know.

898
00:57:41.781 --> 00:57:45.490
I feel like I can feel it though.
I can feel the information.
I know.
You're right.

899
00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:49.340
You're right.
I really do.
You know,

900
00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:54.170
<v 15>wonder.
There's just so much.
That's just so much to talk about.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

901
00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:58.290
Um,
you know,
like women,
they all talk about their periods.

902
00:57:58.350 --> 00:58:02.010
They share information,
techniques,
but we all shit,

903
00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:06.330
all of all of us this room,
you know what I'm saying?
And so Anders all binaries,

904
00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:11.190
right?
There's no argument about,
um,
oh,
I'm not,
I don't identify as this gender.

905
00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:15.510
You still shit.
So we're not debating that.
Right.
So I just,

906
00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:18.930
I don't understand the,
the lack of dialogue about it.

907
00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:21.360
So what old blind people do.
Oh,
okay.
We've

908
00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:25.820
<v 14>talked about that on this show.
Do they smell it and know what was the answer?</v>

909
00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:32.040
They actually,
somebody actually answered us like they,
they sense it.
Right?

910
00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:35.170
They have that daredevil level of now they got

911
00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:41.940
squishy that toilet paper bills.
They get a sense for it.
Yeah.
Like what it was.

912
00:58:41.970 --> 00:58:46.260
Yeah.
They stay sense.
The resistance of the paper,
how it moves.

913
00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:48.570
That's not accurate.
It's of coil.
It's not,

914
00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:51.180
they want their a blind people are walking around with Shitty assholes.

915
00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:54.840
But that's fine.
They go fast.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
They get a pass.
But what is that?

916
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:59.040
Is there a feedback from my phone?
I've got,
oh,
should we turn it all the way to,

917
00:58:59.041 --> 00:59:01.820
there you go.
That's why you,
where should I move it away?
Maybe.

918
00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:06.360
Maybe I'll throw number.
Here's my worry for you.
So,

919
00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:10.350
okay.
You're telling me that you,
when you have a marker kind of day,

920
00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:15.490
you don't have,
you guys don't have the days yet.
No.
So what are you doing?
Yeah,

921
00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:19.510
you were talking about and that's during junior forces.
Well,
it's a,

922
00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:22.970
I mean you're about making the leap though,
right?
Yes.

923
00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:26.940
<v 15>I have some,
I have some issues with a buddy.
Hey,</v>

924
00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:31.430
I was in Canada recently and to my great surprise,

925
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:34.500
they had these wonderful Japanese toilets.
Leaky.

926
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:40.150
This was in Quebec and Montreal.
What'd I say?
That's the state.

927
00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:41.840
So it's a,
yeah,
in Montreal.

928
00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:45.980
And they had the whole thing with the heated seat and the water at squirts it

929
00:59:45.981 --> 00:59:49.220
right at your asshole.
And there's all the different pressure settings.

930
00:59:49.221 --> 00:59:51.890
It's got the whole,
it's got the whole works.
It even if you can,
my language,

931
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:54.980
it has a front squirt,
which I was like,
oh,
what the fuck is that?

932
00:59:54.981 --> 00:59:59.780
And I checked score to by taint.
Yeah,
it feels good.
That was interesting.

933
01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:04.040
I was just kinda like moving all over the place is that I was like,
Oh shit,

934
01:00:04.041 --> 01:00:07.490
the Vaginas Kinda,
they're not that write up.

935
01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:12.410
It's not that far from the asshole because it's basically like just a very,

936
01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:14.120
the front load.
It was very close to the back.

937
01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:18.890
<v 14>Well see and that's why wiping properly so important and they tell you you can't</v>

938
01:00:18.891 --> 01:00:22.980
go back to front,
front to back is it's very,
you know,

939
01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:27.460
<v 15>so is it not an issue that if you're squirting,</v>

940
01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.370
you're gonna splash some shit water.

941
01:00:30.550 --> 01:00:34.660
The problem I had with it was that I was squirting and I was squirting and water

942
01:00:34.661 --> 01:00:38.780
was running down my balls.
Why

943
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:41.570
<v 14>not have that?
I mean every time.
Yeah.</v>

944
01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:45.200
But the other thing I do avoid that if you keep that water running eventually

945
01:00:45.201 --> 01:00:50.150
he's just beautiful,
clean water.
So I think you might have some browns splatter,

946
01:00:50.570 --> 01:00:55.010
but that water is going to keep hearing this.
He's getting shit on his balls.

947
01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:59.680
Hello?
What's new?
I mean that's my man there.
Shit everywhere.

948
01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:04.690
There's hair everywhere to look at scrum and I won't do it because that's the,

949
01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:10.490
the,
it's kind of just that general area.
I feel like she wants to Tang.
Yeah,

950
01:01:10.491 --> 01:01:13.670

All of it.
She won't do it.

951
01:01:14.610 --> 01:01:18.530
You ask no way.

952
01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:20.121

The thing is like if you're nasty as hell.
Thompson.
Anyways,

955
01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:34.720
Ethan and I were talking and I were talking I think is my asshole's not was

956
01:01:34.731 --> 01:01:38.630
never meant to be licked.
Right.
Don't like that either.

957
01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:45.320
A warning zone gusting.
Yeah.
I have a feeling we,
I mean looking at you,

958
01:01:45.321 --> 01:01:50.030
I think we have the same
similar issues.
Yeah.

959
01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:53.690
Harry and hot cause his bottles Harry and hot.

960
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:59.170
My thought always bold my but always has heat coming off of it.

961
01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:03.950
It could be sub arctic weather and like put your hand.
You'd be like,

962
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:08.820
oh my hands a friend.
This guy.
Just always,
why you're such an oven.

963
01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:13.760
I don't know that asks oven.
I know.
It's just like welcoming for a tongue.

964
01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:15.680
It's like he's got a hung out there

965
01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:22.100
saying put your mouth down here lady.
It's nice.
Yeah.

966
01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:26.250
Have you seen as be hall,
uh,
how long have you two been together now?

967
01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:30.500
What's the last time I saw it?
I haven't seen my own asshole since I was like 13.

968
01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:33.780
I was like,
what am I an asshole look like it doesn't look nice.

969
01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:38.530
Well you look once in your life that God don't need to do that.
Yeah.

970
01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:42.770
I remember I spread my cheeks to a friend in middle school.
Really?

971
01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:44.480
What was the context?
It was like,

972
01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:48.150
it was just like sleep over stuff and I just spread my cheeks to him and he
goes,

973
01:02:48.151 --> 01:02:52.560
Jesus.
And uh,
and it was Peter and he goes,
you should hair.

974
01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:58.230
Yeah.
And I was like,
it was amazing.
And I wasn't as Harry then,

975
01:02:58.231 --> 01:02:59.160
so I was like,

976
01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:02.700
did you feel like you understood something new about yourself in that moment?

977
01:03:02.890 --> 01:03:06.550
He said it.
I knew that it was like not something to show a girl.
Right.
You know,

978
01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:07.560
because he was like

979
01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:13.650
14 years different.
That's love.
I love that

980
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:20.480
we show them one day when you show them,
whoa,
no,
like he does this.
Okay,

981
01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:23.920
so we'll be like them one day.
Okay.

982
01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:28.950
So we'll be playing around in the rumor and he does this like slutty stripper

983
01:03:29.041 --> 01:03:31.050
girl move where he turns,

984
01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:35.580
he turns his back to me and then he like bends over and then he slaps his ass.

985
01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:39.270
He like Shimmies is hands down the back of his legs and some tops.

986
01:03:39.271 --> 01:03:42.380
That's pretty hot.
Moving a little bit.

987
01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:47.540
I wanted to offer you guys and then you see his asshole.

988
01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:53.970
Sometimes I'll pull his pants down and then he'll spread it because as I run my

989
01:03:53.971 --> 01:03:56.040
hands down the back of my legs,
I'll pull my shorts with it.

990
01:03:56.041 --> 01:04:00.480
Like here's a little treat for you.
I'll just show everything.

991
01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:01.440
Does that do anything for you?

992
01:04:08.730 --> 01:04:13.080
Not as gross as Tom is with me.
Am I right?

993
01:04:13.081 --> 01:04:16.510
Do you guys okay?
I'm gonna ask you this.
Do you poop with the doors open?

994
01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:21.090
Are we closed door?
Family?
It happened was when the doors open,
sometimes it's,

995
01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:25.020
I'm not going to go full door open,
but like crack a jar.

996
01:04:25.050 --> 01:04:29.640
So that's one that we don't do our boundary,
really talk about it here,

997
01:04:29.641 --> 01:04:33.320
but door closed,
door closed just this morning.
You look Claude,

998
01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:34.650
the fucking toilet in the room.

999
01:04:34.651 --> 01:04:38.620
We exercise like literally like her shit was so massive.

1000
01:04:39.930 --> 01:04:43.920
I mean I don't clog toilet and so that was just,

1001
01:04:43.921 --> 01:04:47.610
we just exercise next to Ilissa a shitty clogged toilet.

1002
01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.210
But what are you going to do to fix that?
Are you going to call us?

1003
01:04:51.211 --> 01:04:56.080
Actually Ethan told me that it was fixed while I,
well he was like,
we gotta get,

1004
01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.750
we gotta get a plunger.
And I was like,

1005
01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:01.710
just give it a minute and she leaves the room and then you hear inevitably
though

1006
01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:07.460
the earth took it back.
Wow.
You got lucky then.
Yeah.

1007
01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:11.810
So is he not as grows with you as Tom is with me,
would you say are yeah,

1008
01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:13.350
I think so.
Probably.

1009
01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:16.830
Sounds like I walk around naked and I feel like that's gross enough.

1010
01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:21.370
I see myself in the mirror and I'm like,
fuck,
I can only do it for a moment.

1011
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:26.200
I'm so ashamed of my,
I can only like flash it and be like,
I got to cover this.

1012
01:05:26.370 --> 01:05:26.800
Right.
Yeah.

1013
01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:31.690
I tried to Ethan and will make himself little growth third than he needs to like

1014
01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:37.090
band and show me the fold.
Well are you,
are you ever do this?

1015
01:05:37.091 --> 01:05:39.720
Like you just,
your back here,

1016
01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:43.100
bend over and when you're naked and you see it like resting on your legs,

1017
01:05:43.110 --> 01:05:45.410
the one,
it's like an,
it's like an appendage.
Yeah.

1018
01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:48.340
And it restricts your breathing.
It just restricts your breathing.

1019
01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:52.780
If you sit for you like,
oh,
why can't I breathe as well?
Cause my stomach,

1020
01:05:52.830 --> 01:05:57.310
you know,
pressing up on my lungs.
The last time I went on a series of diet was,

1021
01:05:57.430 --> 01:06:02.110
it was,
I had this moment I was tying my shoe and I couldn't breathe.
Oh my God.

1022
01:06:02.330 --> 01:06:05.420
Yeah.
I was like,
you're winded.
No,
I was not.

1023
01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:09.280
It's not that I was exhausted.
I,
there was so much pressure on my lungs,

1024
01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:13.390
I couldn't literally breathe.
And that was like warning signs.
Yeah.

1025
01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:16.450
That's when I lost like 15 pounds.
Oh.
How'd you do it?

1026
01:06:16.451 --> 01:06:19.940
What was your I just didn't eat.
Yeah.
That's the only way to lose weight.
Yeah.

1027
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:23.890
Yeah.
You know,
my favorite is when I leave up the stairs and I,
you know,

1028
01:06:23.891 --> 01:06:27.610
when you're jumping up and you can feel your fat tire at the same time,

1029
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:30.490
that's kind of special,
so yeah.
Yeah.
That is special.
I agree.

1030
01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:35.300
She's not part of this conversation.

1031

or is it a travel size bottle of

1062
01:09:10.030 --> 01:09:12.560
mocking Oprah?
How Oprah would do that.

1063
01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:18.240
It's not a joke I sweat about.
It's like it's done premium.

1067
01:09:34.030 --> 01:09:36.060
I follow her on Instagram and she's,

1068
01:09:36.061 --> 01:09:38.520

1069
01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:43.830
and like her old talent is walking,

you know,

1070
01:09:43.831 --> 01:09:47.400
models that's a fucking talent duty.
But she's like,

The next top model or did you guys ever watch that horse horse?

Yeah.
Like,
dude,

1077
01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:15.400

But I feel like models don't do this today.
I know,

1078
01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:19.080
right?
It was like yesterday.
It's like cheesy now.

1079
01:10:19.170 --> 01:10:22.100
That was how to cut when I was,
when I was like fashion.

1080
01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:24.750
When I first started going through puberty,

1081
01:10:24.751 --> 01:10:29.120
she was like popular fuck she had is your jam.
She had it yet.

You rubbed a few out to her bro.

1083
01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:37.930

Yeah.

By the way,
for context.
Yeah.

1084
01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.900
I don't actually collect my semen.

1085
01:10:39.901 --> 01:10:43.530
I'm just making a joke about testing my semen for sure to get you the pregnant.

1086
01:10:43.531 --> 01:10:47.940
But now she's just a bit of a,
I mean,
she still looks good.
She loves sharing.

1087
01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:51.630
Has been around forever.
Those,
uh,
those supermodels that we grew up with,

1088
01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:55.510
they basically all look amazing story.
That's true.
Genetic phenotypes.

1089
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:59.340
You know Christy Brown,
you know what it is.
Yeah.
Ireland.
Cindy Crawford,

1090
01:10:59.341 --> 01:11:02.360
Turlington coping.
It is Vaseline and it's the fucking best.

1091
01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:10.010
Where do I get that shit?
Fuck.
That's her beauty secret.
That was so bizarre.

1092
01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:14.960
He's got a best friend here.
That's Fifo.
His mouth smells really bad.
Sorry.

1093
01:11:14.961 --> 01:11:19.150
Thank you Brett.
He's an old dude.
Hey Buddy.
His mouth stinks.
So,

1094
01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:22.410
so Germany has this program,

1095
01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:27.500
do you know where disabled people can legally find someone to help make them

1096
01:11:30.010 --> 01:11:34.620
come?
I think a state head of the gay.

1097
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:38.020
I know,
right?
Like does that include me?
Whoa.

1098
01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:43.823
<v 2>Can I say</v>

1099
01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:49.490
<v 14>let's enjoy it.
Let's say I actually,
why I want to enjoy this video.
Okay.</v>

1100
01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:50.633
All right.

1101
01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:58.130
<v 2>Is
one that we all have inside of us.</v>

1102
01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:03.650
Sexual energy means we surely realize the reason why sexual assistance is so

1103
01:12:03.651 --> 01:12:04.580
necessary.
Very.

1104
01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:07.060
<v 14>I'm reading because I didn't realize this is all Alphas.</v>

1105
01:12:07.670 --> 01:12:10.790
Well why not just get a prostitute though?
I guess.
I think they are.

1106
01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.600
They are like state sponsored.
Hmm.

1107
01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:17.870
Prostitutes specifically for the disabled Holzman's that's,

1108
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:21.650
that honestly is a tender beautiful thing.

1109
01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:25.050
It is for a state,
for an actual government organization.

1110
01:12:25.130 --> 01:12:29.530
Like be like these guys.
They need someone to touch their dick.
Yeah.

1111
01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:32.570
As much as any,
any of us more maybe.
Sure.

1112
01:12:32.930 --> 01:12:37.420
I mean I might try to be disabled if she's one I have,
she the one that's,

1113
01:12:37.421 --> 01:12:39.590
she's getting to.
What if one of these,
what if he's like,

1114
01:12:39.710 --> 01:12:43.790
well you look my asshole.
Like,
I didn't even look.

1115
01:12:43.791 --> 01:12:47.920
My husband died.
She's like,
I can't come.

1116
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:53.150
I can't come.
She's not the check that comes to your house.

1117
01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:57.380
No way,
dude.
I Dunno.
She's looking at me like she comes to the house and Yup.

1118
01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:02.070
That's the lady dude.
That guy's having the time.
It was

1119
01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:08.640
for those of you just listening.
It's like,
wait,
who's The handicapped there?
Oh,

1120
01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:12.170
right.
Well there was like,
I just didn't know who was,

1121
01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:17.050
who was getting the benefit.
It's the guy,
the guy's getting the benefit.

1122
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:21.480
I'd fuck that guy.
What's wrong with them?
I don't know his legs.
Yeah.

1123
01:13:21.850 --> 01:13:24.740
I'm having like a weird thing where I did,
it looks like a her legs.

1124
01:13:25.050 --> 01:13:30.020
It doesn't yet.
The photograph kneeled on the floor though.
Okay.
You see her legs?

1125
01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:33.940
Yeah.
Going on in the side there.
I like,

1126
01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:36.900
I don't know that the state should sponsor it,
but it is.
Well,

1127
01:13:36.901 --> 01:13:39.080
they're basically telling their citizens,
you need to come.

1128
01:13:39.690 --> 01:13:43.310
You're telling them don't keep it all in,
not too handicapped to come.

1129
01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:50.690
It's like a,
it's a,
it's sex welfare.
How progressive that is.

1130
01:13:50.691 --> 01:13:54.650
Progressive as it gets.
It's pretty great.
I'll show you

1131
01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:01.070
who's coming right now.
That's just a care

1132
01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:06.670
carefully screened.
You better make them currently trained.

1133
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:11.030
They're trained to provide,
it's just a blonde guy on the street.
I,

1134
01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:13.870
let's cut to the chase though.
He get laid on his own.

1135
01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:18.650
I don't think that being blind really is that much of a hindrance of getting on?

1136
01:14:18.690 --> 01:14:22.120
I don't think so either,
but I would,
I would take good lay into it.

1137
01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:24.770
If I was in Germany I'd be like,
I can't see any,

1138
01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:31.270
oh that's he is the,

1139
01:14:33.170 --> 01:14:36.610
he's saying I see her twice a month learning different sexual positions.

1140
01:14:36.670 --> 01:14:38.350
I'm young,
I'm satisfied.

1141
01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:44.280
I'm not in love with Laca.
I'm looking for a girlfriend.
Okay.

1142
01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:47.650
He's learning all those things to do.
That's cool.
Yeah.

1143
01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:51.310
That's quite a gig though,
man.
I ask a question.
Yeah.

1144
01:14:51.370 --> 01:14:55.240
Cause there's like diseases that make like old people look like children.
Yeah.

1145
01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:56.530
Pejorative.
Pretoria.

1146
01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:01.560
Do you fuck like that's like as the sex worker you have to fuck.

1147
01:15:03.970 --> 01:15:07.430
Yeah.
Like it's a person that looks like a kid.
Oh,
that'd be tough.

1148
01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:12.310
Did they really look like a kid though?
Like whoa,
creepy old,

1149
01:15:13.210 --> 01:15:17.660
creepy,
old case.
Physically,
I don't know.

1150
01:15:18.050 --> 01:15:18.950
<v 0>Well this kind of reminded,</v>

1151
01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:23.960
I know this brings me back to our opening clip was this guy who faked being

1152
01:15:24.111 --> 01:15:29.030
disabled so that um,
caretakers would change his diaper and bathe him.

1153
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:33.370
Why didn't he got,
he got arrested.
Whoa.
That's like,

1154
01:15:33.390 --> 01:15:37.770
it seems like he was actually basically wanting,
it was just enjoying.
Yes.

1155
01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:43.020
Right.
Yeah.
So what he was doing was he put in,
um,

1156
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:47.120
he signed on to a service online,
said that he was the character.

1157
01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:50.750
He pretended to be a woman named Amy said that had a,

1158
01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:55.490
a client that needed bathing and changing and then hired people.

1159
01:15:55.491 --> 01:16:00.020
But he was the one doing the whole time and then pretended to be disabled and

1160
01:16:00.021 --> 01:16:02.600
then somebody,
yeah,
wait,

1161
01:16:02.601 --> 01:16:05.080
but this would take away was actually like supportive of,
of his,

1162
01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:09.320
<v 14>and then I realized he's pretty criminal.
It doesn't,</v>

1163
01:16:09.321 --> 01:16:13.310
this takeaway sex workers work.
I mean it's,
it's sex work illegal in Germany.

1164
01:16:13.690 --> 01:16:17.130
No problem.
Yeah,
they're probably the same people.
Oh,

1165
01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:20.220
they're getting hooked up everyone.
Okay.
Gotcha.

1166
01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:22.520
Hookers getting paid by member.

1167
01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:27.290
Yoshi said his favorite place was a Frankfurt or something to go for his.

1168
01:16:27.291 --> 01:16:30.240
One of our friends only sees hookers.
Oh really?
International.

1169
01:16:31.050 --> 01:16:35.000
And he saves money like he'll do,
he does medical testing on his own body,

1170
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:37.670
like who signs up for those things?
Just might kill you.

1171
01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:42.710
This might give you a Parkinson's.
And he's like,
okay.
And then they pay out,

1172
01:16:42.711 --> 01:16:47.640
you know,
it's like five grand for weeks of staying there and Parkinson's.

1173
01:16:47.690 --> 01:16:50.660
Yeah.
I'm like,
so what are you doing now?
He's like,
well,
I got like five grand,

1174
01:16:50.661 --> 01:16:55.550
I'm going to go to Amsterdam.
I love,
yeah,
I miss living like that.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1175
01:16:55.970 --> 01:16:58.550
Kind of,
well not to that extent,

1176
01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:01.790
but I mean like when you get a hundred bucks and then you buy some beers and

1177
01:17:01.791 --> 01:17:05.120
sausages and you're fully content,
you know what I mean?
Sure.

1178
01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:06.680
That's that version of that.
Yeah.

1179
01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:12.020
Here's how marketing is he scamming anyone or I guess I just didn't understand

1180
01:17:12.141 --> 01:17:15.180
what's the crime?
This guy?
Yeah,
I was confused.

1181
01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:19.940
Really ever needed help.
And then what's the big deal if they're getting paid?

1182
01:17:20.150 --> 01:17:24.760
This was exactly my opinion is the government subsidizing.
I think it said,

1183
01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:28.580
boy,
she's chilling.
Chalkup pretended to have down syndrome,

1184
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:30.920
so I didn't know.

1185
01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:38.630
Isn't there a look?
I mean I generally a look.
Yeah.

1186
01:17:38.631 --> 01:17:43.100
I feel like after I've seen the hospital and there's like,

1187
01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:48.130
you have a whole section of people and there's one person in on doing their

1188
01:17:48.981 --> 01:17:51.640
shift and then the every two hours they're like,

1189
01:17:51.650 --> 01:17:55.250
change everyone's diapers and then you realize like this is,

1190
01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.470
this has to be the worst job.

1191
01:17:58.650 --> 01:18:02.720
And they're like angels.
They are now.
That's why I was saying,

1192
01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:05.780
that's why when I heard that I was like,
that's evil

1193
01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:11.400
because these sweet people and getting actually I go like,
I mean,

1194
01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:13.910
what's he doing?
He's just like mechanic and he's enjoying himself,

1195
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:17.300
but he is preying on somebody goodwill.
Yeah.

1196
01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:21.560
It's not in this put in the article I read there were like the caregiver's role.

1197
01:18:21.561 --> 01:18:25.670
Like he insisted on more thorough Washington generals.

1198
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:29.870
They always had an erection for every bad.

1199
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:35.690
Well that's just it.
Yeah.
That sounds like kind of like,

1200
01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:38.270
it's still honestly doesn't like just on the surface you're like,
yeah,

1201
01:18:38.271 --> 01:18:40.790
that's what he likes.
I mean it's icy.

1202
01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:43.460
I think you make a good point by the grace of God.

1203
01:18:43.461 --> 01:18:46.870
Walk these people on this planet and the sick fuck is making him rubbing.

1204
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:50.960
Are we hearing this wrong?
By the way,
remember the baseball clip?

1205
01:18:51.650 --> 01:18:55.480
Are we hearing that wrong?
I don't know.
We should ask them.
Would you guys do

1206
01:19:00.930 --> 01:19:01.763
<v 6>retarded?</v>

1207
01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:07.390
<v 14>I heard definitely something retarded.
Okay,
so we're not in,</v>

1208
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:12.400
we're not mishearing that.
Play it again.
Just want to make sure.

1209
01:19:16.890 --> 01:19:17.723
<v 6>Retarded.</v>

1210
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:23.110
<v 14>Yeah.
What else could he be?
Who holds is the guy's name?
Elder.
Cool.
Oh,</v>

1211
01:19:23.130 --> 01:19:25.960
is retired.
Is he retired?
He does sound like you saying that right?
Yep.

1212
01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:27.673
<v 6>Cool.</v>

1213
01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:33.440
<v 14>What else could it be?
I'm trying to rack my brain</v>

1214
01:19:34.810 --> 01:19:35.643
<v 6>retarded.</v>

1215
01:19:36.930 --> 01:19:39.180
<v 14>There's really no alternate explanation.</v>

1216
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:44.400
I just wanted to confirm when they confirm.
I heard,
that's what I heard.
Okay.

1217
01:19:44.610 --> 01:19:48.740
Right.
You heard something was our word really leaning into the r word?
I mean,

1218
01:19:48.741 --> 01:19:53.690
I'm just trying to understand what's happening.
I just,
I don't know.

1219
01:19:54.010 --> 01:19:57.020
Um,
here's what I want to ask you guys though.
So,
you know,

1220
01:19:57.021 --> 01:19:59.690
we've gotten to know you guys a little bit personally,

1221
01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:02.840
ultra fascinated because you know,
we come,

1222
01:20:02.841 --> 01:20:07.710
we come from the stand up performing world and honestly

1223
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:11.490
<v 0>the whole youtube of it all is almost foreign to us.
Right?</v>

1224
01:20:11.491 --> 01:20:15.390
Like we always knew there's like youtube stars and stuff.
And then when you guys,

1225
01:20:15.391 --> 01:20:17.550
I was talking to you guys about how you got started.

1226
01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:20.490
You're like throwing up a video and at one point you said,

1227
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:24.780
I think you said for two years you didn't have a thousand subscribers.

1228
01:20:26.370 --> 01:20:27.260
A year 10

1229
01:20:27.850 --> 01:20:32.450
<v 15>they're just like two years to get,
I think a thousand subscribers.
Two years.</v>

1230
01:20:33.490 --> 01:20:38.050
But that's like everybody's rise to you is different because it can happen.

1231
01:20:38.890 --> 01:20:42.360
You know,
there's people that will grow to start them

1232
01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:46.420
<v 0>in those two years though.
Is this is just then a fun thing you're doing,</v>

1233
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:47.740
you're like,
yes,
we just enjoy ourselves.

1234
01:20:47.790 --> 01:20:49.380
<v 15>Yeah.
There was nothing at stake.</v>

1235
01:20:49.381 --> 01:20:53.490
There was no delusions of grandeur.

1236
01:20:53.491 --> 01:20:57.270
There was no expectation at all.
It was very much,

1237
01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:00.630
I mean our early videos are fucking so off the wall,
dude,

1238
01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:02.670
like complete like unwatchable.

1239
01:21:02.671 --> 01:21:06.720
So I'm not surprised at all that nobody watched them for that long.
There was,

1240
01:21:06.721 --> 01:21:10.600
there was quite frankly no reason to watch them.
Uh,

1241
01:21:10.910 --> 01:21:14.000
<v 0>and they were also like where they,
uh,
just funny videos.</v>

1242
01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:17.720
<v 15>Yes.
Okay.
Attempt,
attempt at humor.
Yeah.</v>

1243
01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:20.800
Gotcha.
Yeah.
I,

1244
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:25.340
it was a lot of just trying to find my voice and my style

1245
01:21:25.490 --> 01:21:29.130
<v 0>and you,
but you still are like,
this is just,
I do this for fun.
Right.</v>

1246
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:34.280
<v 15>Very much.
Yeah.
I mean I wanted to,
um,
I want it to work in comedy.</v>

1247
01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:37.250
I never,
I never thought that could be a performer.
I thought like,
Oh,

1248
01:21:37.251 --> 01:21:41.900
maybe I'll hold right for somebody.
But this was just my way of being like,

1249
01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:43.540
well I want to do comedy because I was,

1250
01:21:43.650 --> 01:21:47.990
I worked when we were in Israel for five years at a desk job and so I was five

1251
01:21:47.991 --> 01:21:49.940
years.
Yeah.
And Marketing.

1252
01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:54.090
<v 0>Well I was going to school.
He was working,</v>

1253
01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:57.690
I was working too.
But what was your desk?
What kind of job?

1254
01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:01.120
<v 15>I was just a content manager,
cause I'm,
and you know,</v>

1255
01:22:01.170 --> 01:22:04.900
I have a degree in English and writing.
So when you go to Israel,

1256
01:22:04.901 --> 01:22:07.900
that's actually like a marketable skill,

1257
01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:12.310
which was crazy because I was looking for a job for a year and then when I moved

1258
01:22:12.311 --> 01:22:16.030
to Israel all of a sudden I got a job,
like an actual real job.
So that was cool.

1259
01:22:16.031 --> 01:22:18.880
It's exciting for me at the time cause I didn't think that whatever,
you know,

1260
01:22:18.910 --> 01:22:19.570
whatever.

1261
01:22:19.570 --> 01:22:24.570
But so five years work in a job that I eventually wasn't satisfied because who

1262
01:22:24.671 --> 01:22:26.200
the fuck has satisfied with that work?

1263
01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:30.880
And just saying that I want to do comedy,

1264
01:22:30.881 --> 01:22:32.230
so let me do something about it.

1265
01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:35.680
So I just sat down or I'm going to start making some stupid videos on youtube.

1266
01:22:35.681 --> 01:22:39.190
And over the course of two years kind of found my voice.

1267
01:22:39.191 --> 01:22:42.140
And then I think we started getting more serious about it.

1268
01:22:42.141 --> 01:22:45.280
And when we've kind of found that different kinds of things that we thought were

1269
01:22:45.281 --> 01:22:50.281
working and were funny and like from the first two years and then from the third

1270
01:22:53.381 --> 01:22:56.790
year,
I think by the end of the third year we probably had a million subscribers.

1271
01:22:57.130 --> 01:23:02.020
<v 0>So between year two or 3:00 AM I wrong?
When we left Israel,
when we moved here,</v>

1272
01:23:02.021 --> 01:23:06.010
we had about a hundred thousand subscribers.
So at that point though,
let's

1273
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:10.240
<v 15>see,
I liked the tiers.
How long ago was that?
Three years ago.</v>

1274
01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:15.820
That's why I basically,
we've been doing it professionally for

1275
01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:19.630
basically since we moved here.
So about three years.

1276
01:23:19.670 --> 01:23:22.740
You realize that you realize that's like that's a Nanosecond,
right?
Yeah.

1277
01:23:22.810 --> 01:23:26.290
That's crazy.
So wait on Youtube,
it felt like

1278
01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:32.320
time flies so fast on your toes.
It could happen to them over a month.
I'm like,

1279
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:36.880
really?
That's happened many times.
Better to go your route.
Yeah,
it is.

1280
01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:40.120
Because these people,
they come and they go,
you don't want to be the rocket ship.

1281
01:23:40.121 --> 01:23:43.960
You want to be the steady,
steady climb at what point.

1282
01:23:43.961 --> 01:23:46.480
So at 100,000 subscribers you obviously know like,
well,

1283
01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:49.720
like people are digging what we're doing.
So then you go like,

1284
01:23:49.721 --> 01:23:54.340
we need to focus on it more.
Like we need to try and make this out.
We were very,

1285
01:23:54.341 --> 01:23:58.510
very focused on like the craft and the presentation and the packaging.

1286
01:23:58.570 --> 01:23:59.403
And um,

1287
01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:05.220
we were like perfectionists and we were just solely committed to creating like

1288
01:24:06.101 --> 01:24:09.410
one video a week.
That was like the best thing we could.
But,

1289
01:24:09.850 --> 01:24:12.310
<v 18>and it was also finding,
cause we were both like,</v>

1290
01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:16.400
we didn't know how to use the camera properly or sound or anything,
so everybody,

1291
01:24:16.401 --> 01:24:17.860
wait,
could we tried to make it better?

1292
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:21.780
And we like starting from minus painful,

1293
01:24:22.630 --> 01:24:23.463
painful

1294
01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:26.920
<v 15>through cute too that you guys see you did this all as a couple though too.</v>

1295
01:24:27.250 --> 01:24:30.010
We made the channel,
um,

1296
01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:34.220
we made the channel together the first day.
Ella had a video,

1297
01:24:34.221 --> 01:24:36.090
our class and they,

1298
01:24:36.690 --> 01:24:41.670
<v 18>it was one of the mandatory classes on the first year was video art and they</v>

1299
01:24:41.671 --> 01:24:44.370
just gave us an assignment to make something.
And I,

1300
01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:46.530
I didn't want to be in it because I was so shy.

1301
01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:50.580
So I bought a camera on home and I was like,
do you want to do something?

1302
01:24:51.210 --> 01:24:56.210
And they record anything and that's how cool is that the first video that caused

1303
01:24:57.590 --> 01:25:00.330
the whole four years.
And,
um,

1304
01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:03.690
all the videos I showed them were really weird videos with Nathan.

1305
01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:07.770
What you get in that class?
What was the grade?
It was good.
It was,

1306
01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.960
I don't remember.
But you show up,
you get a good grade.

1307
01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:14.760
I was like a big Dorian.

1308
01:25:16.670 --> 01:25:20.820
Whoa.
All thanks to me for sure.
For sure.

1309
01:25:20.821 --> 01:25:24.210
For Ethan in your videos now the videos we made were very light,

1310
01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:29.220
<v 15>like a Tim and Eric inspired and like lots of those guy nudity and just</v>

1311
01:25:29.681 --> 01:25:33.070
disgusting,
like really off,
just like embarrassing.

1312
01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:37.670
<v 18>And that me,
they didn't make it through Israel yet.
The fuck is wrong with you.</v>

1313
01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:43.450
<v 15>I think they thought we were trying to be like avant garde.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1314
01:25:43.630 --> 01:25:45.250
But not funny.
Definitely not funny.

1315
01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:48.510
So then when was it undeniable to you that this is actually a career?

1316
01:25:48.570 --> 01:25:51.940
The three years ago,
so I had a,
I had like a,
uh,

1317
01:25:52.210 --> 01:25:57.210
a job that was going really well and I'd worked there for a year and I had just

1318
01:25:57.341 --> 01:26:00.300
decided basically that I wanted to see this.
I don't,

1319
01:26:00.330 --> 01:26:05.090
I think I was probably making like $1,000 a month from youtube at the time.

1320
01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:09.680
It was not a lot,
but it was like,
hey,
that's a little fucking money.
Right.

1321
01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:11.220
So I quit.
I just said,
fuck it.

1322
01:26:11.221 --> 01:26:14.240
I'm going to quit my job and I'm a commit myself to doing this.

1323
01:26:14.370 --> 01:26:18.500
She was just because I want to give it a fair shot and um,

1324
01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:20.590
<v 14>sorry to cut you up,
but this is the kind of real,</v>

1325
01:26:20.630 --> 01:26:22.460
you have the kind of relationship with your parents where you tell them

1326
01:26:22.461 --> 01:26:26.010
something like that.
Like I'm quitting.
Yeah.
And they were like,
I mean they don't,

1327
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:29.480
I remember my mom even with like,
really,

1328
01:26:29.481 --> 01:26:32.990
why are you sure you don't want to find another job before you quit your job?

1329
01:26:32.991 --> 01:26:35.800
And it's like,
no,
the point is to,
doesn't want to do that.

1330
01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:39.830
<v 15>Well my mom was trying to get me to become a teacher.
Even,</v>

1331
01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:43.250
<v 14>even as recently as like,
like two years ago</v>

1332
01:26:45.370 --> 01:26:46.620
<v 15>they lived in Vegas and we,</v>

1333
01:26:46.621 --> 01:26:49.750
when we first immigrated to the u s cause we've got yellow,

1334
01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:53.850
a green card after we got married.
And she's like,
are you sure you don't,

1335
01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:56.390
they have this great teacher program out here.
And,

1336
01:26:56.830 --> 01:27:00.430
and even at the time I was probably making like five,
$6,000 a month,

1337
01:27:00.431 --> 01:27:04.870
like doing like pretty good considering I was a youtube entertainer and that's a

1338
01:27:04.871 --> 01:27:09.460
great living.
But my,
I never really heated much advice from them.

1339
01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:14.300
<v 14>So you take,
but at the time when you quit your thousand dollars a month revenue,</v>

1340
01:27:14.690 --> 01:27:17.920
you really just focus on making these videos.
Yeah.

1341
01:27:18.230 --> 01:27:20.030
And then it just steadily paid off.

1342
01:27:20.290 --> 01:27:23.800
<v 15>Yeah,
absolutely.
I never went back to work after that and it steadily paid off.</v>

1343
01:27:23.801 --> 01:27:27.220
And I mean like Isla was like hand stitching these little,

1344
01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:31.210
we called them Jeff dumb fuck dolls cause I,
I'm obsessed with Jeff Dunham.

1345
01:27:31.211 --> 01:27:35.860
I think he's like fast.
The phenomenon of Jeff Dunham fascinates me.

1346
01:27:36.130 --> 01:27:37.930
Fucking venture look racist,

1347
01:27:38.230 --> 01:27:41.200
white trash ventriloquist that everybody loves.

1348
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:45.530
<v 14>Uh Huh.
And so I the label and</v>

1349
01:27:47.690 --> 01:27:52.220
he literally wears like a shark tooth Pooka shell necklace.
Yes.

1350
01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:55.160
To this day he,
he also,
he also build,

1351
01:27:55.190 --> 01:27:59.870
he'll hand build a kit helicopter and then fly it,
you know,
like a,

1352
01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:04.820
basically a cheap helicopter.
He'll make one riot.
It's Kinda crazy too.

1353
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:10.270
He will do daytime arena shows like high noon because that's,

1354
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:16.850
that's just tough.
Right?
That's,
that's the toughest game.
But the kids will come.

1355
01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:21.350
The kids,
look I'm annual do like not just secondary markets like third or dairy.

1356
01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:25.130
We're talking like outside of the town,

1357
01:28:25.131 --> 01:28:28.950
outside of the town and sell out whenever you want.
I'll come.
I just,
he,

1358
01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:29.803
he's crazy.

1359
01:28:30.730 --> 01:28:34.690
<v 15>But it's like nobody was like,
hold on,
this guy's a fucking ventriloquist.</v>

1360
01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:38.530
Let's all stop and just think that this guy is actually doing comedy with

1361
01:28:38.531 --> 01:28:42.850
puppets right now.
Yeah.
You gotta love it.
He does.
So that thing,

1362
01:28:42.851 --> 01:28:45.880
fat but also his material fascinates me because it's all very racist.

1363
01:28:45.881 --> 01:28:48.100
It's got like the spicy Jalapeno.
Yeah.

1364
01:28:49.610 --> 01:28:53.430
<v 14>Yeah.
It's just so that's when his career took off because you yeah.</v>

1365
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:57.080
Has been around a no,
he was around for a long time.

1366
01:28:57.081 --> 01:29:01.070
Do you want to know is what that was what made him take off?

1367
01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:02.310
Cause when nine 11 happened,

1368
01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:06.740
it made his career and he was just a puppeteer guy for you remember?

1369
01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:11.780
<v 0>Or this cause I moved out here after nine 11 he was on last comic standing the</v>

1370
01:29:12.151 --> 01:29:14.910
regional spot in like year two,
year three.

1371
01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:17.610
So he was still trying to get like bump,

1372
01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:21.540
like he had had a wave where he was successful and then it kind of faded a

1373
01:29:21.541 --> 01:29:23.940
little bit.
So he's on last comic standing.

1374
01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:28.530
This is year one or year two and I'm at the Melrose Improv for the taping.

1375
01:29:28.590 --> 01:29:32.970
So this is like the La spot and then they'll move on.
They,

1376
01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:37.650
they gave them strict instructions that like if you hit the two minute mark,

1377
01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:40.530
we will cut the sound.
Like we will pull,

1378
01:29:40.531 --> 01:29:45.531
the Mike will die and he was up there and ran the two minute mark and they cut

1379
01:29:47.101 --> 01:29:47.934
the sound.

1380
01:29:48.010 --> 01:29:51.960
And so he was still talking and they were like Jeff and they told him that he

1381
01:29:51.961 --> 01:29:54.990
was so pissed really in the back hallway.

1382
01:29:55.950 --> 01:30:00.120
He was yelling at someone.
And I'll tell you,
even that year you probably,

1383
01:30:00.150 --> 01:30:00.961
you were watching that,

1384
01:30:00.961 --> 01:30:04.230
like he was hoping for a break right here and it didn't happen.

1385
01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:06.540
It's when he took that Akhmed character,

1386
01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:11.790
I think it was Iraq war oh five mm.
And,

1387
01:30:12.210 --> 01:30:13.530
and so like when you know,

1388
01:30:13.531 --> 01:30:17.460
we're like the enemy is over there and started doing like,

1389
01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:21.090
uh,
you know,
we're like,
we're fucking with Iraq.

1390
01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:25.860
And started doing that character that it exploded for him.

1391
01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:27.570
Sinks below.
Say

1392
01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:31.100
<v 14>it was nine 11 and it was like Ahmed remix.</v>

1393
01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:34.260
It's like he got to use it.
You might be,
you might be right.

1394
01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:38.380
I know that she wasn't like that wasn't doing,
he wasn't doing arenas.

1395
01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:42.020
Some have theorized that Jeff Dunham was behind nine 11

1396
01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:47.120
actually all makes sense for his career.
That would be fucking amazing.

1397
01:30:47.121 --> 01:30:51.430
Jeff Dunham did not 11.
You hear it all here folks.
Yeah,
Bro.
So anyway,
um,

1398
01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:55.880
that was the craziest tangent,
but I had this Jeff Dunham fuck doll,

1399
01:30:55.881 --> 01:30:59.750
which was like this mutant aborted fetus and I will do this really fucked up

1400
01:30:59.751 --> 01:31:03.320
puppet shows.
It was,
I was also taking sculpture class.

1401
01:31:03.321 --> 01:31:05.540
I kept trying different snow.
I love this.

1402
01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:10.600
I tried to make in sculptures that I was telling like so why don't know,

1403
01:31:10.690 --> 01:31:15.130
I want it to make a doll of a girl sitting.
And it was a Miley set.

1404
01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:16.700
It was meant to mean Miley Cyrus.

1405
01:31:16.730 --> 01:31:21.470
It was based on the Miley Cyrus on the rocking bowl.
Oh yeah.
Music video.

1406
01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:26.160
So I it was just like a weird character.
Looks like an aborted fetus.
Yeah.

1407
01:31:26.570 --> 01:31:30.260
Well anyway,
the long story short is that people really love these things.

1408
01:31:30.261 --> 01:31:33.860
So either was hand stitching these and selling them and like we were going to

1409
01:31:33.861 --> 01:31:38.180
the post office every week and sending like dozens of these found stamps.com am

1410
01:31:38.181 --> 01:31:42.470
I right?
I wish I had stamps.com sponsored.
Not In Israel.

1411
01:31:43.730 --> 01:31:47.000
I have to stay in the line for like an hour ago.
Oh No,
no.

1412
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:51.440
But we were,
yeah,
we were hustling.
We were hustling.
Love it.

1413
01:31:51.530 --> 01:31:54.560
You guys are such a great team because it's like the idea and then she would

1414
01:31:54.561 --> 01:31:59.530
execute the idea in an art school for people that just don't care who listen.
Uh,

1415
01:31:59.531 --> 01:32:02.560
only especially to the show like the,
you guys are like,

1416
01:32:02.561 --> 01:32:04.210
the videos are obviously you know this,

1417
01:32:04.211 --> 01:32:07.030
but they're legitimately really funny videos.

1418
01:32:07.450 --> 01:32:12.000
I mean you guys are making like really funny comedy stuff happened.
That's fine.

1419
01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:14.280
Um,
but also like I was,
um,

1420
01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:17.770
I remember when I first started checking you guys out online and I saw the

1421
01:32:17.771 --> 01:32:21.700
clothing,
I was like,
oh,
they have like everyone has merged,
they have merged.

1422
01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:23.860
And then I was like,
oh no,
they have a clothing line.

1423
01:32:26.710 --> 01:32:30.460
Things are actually designed here.
Well that's all Ila.
Yeah,
that's awesome.

1424
01:32:31.670 --> 01:32:32.950
First wanted to,

1425
01:32:33.630 --> 01:32:34.463
<v 15>well,</v>

1426
01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:38.610
either plan was always to become a designer and when I first moved to Israel,

1427
01:32:38.611 --> 01:32:40.950
she was in the middle of applying to become,

1428
01:32:41.070 --> 01:32:42.840
go to design school and they rejected her.

1429
01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:46.550
So she ended up going to art school instead.
But like,
um,
we came to a point.
Yeah,

1430
01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:49.050
<v 14>yeah.
Fucking loser.</v>

1431
01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:52.960
<v 15>Hmm.
Anyway,</v>

1432
01:32:52.961 --> 01:32:57.961
we came to a point where we were working very hard on our youtube channel and we

1433
01:32:58.391 --> 01:33:02.050
just thought like,
Hey,
we've got this opportunity.

1434
01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:07.080
We've got like the capital and we've gotten the fan base people who are

1435
01:33:07.241 --> 01:33:10.360
interested in,
you know,
consuming this product.

1436
01:33:10.750 --> 01:33:14.140
So we just thought it was a good opportunity for Eli to pursue.

1437
01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:19.830
<v 14>Yeah.
Eighth really the one who pushed me to do it.
To do the fashion line.
Yeah.</v>

1438
01:33:19.831 --> 01:33:23.910
Cause it was like why not?
I mean,
we have the money.
Well let's just try it.

1439
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:27.870
While we was it scary though,
because I also feel like it's pretty scary.

1440
01:33:28.230 --> 01:33:31.440
I like the steps of like knowing what to do,

1441
01:33:31.470 --> 01:33:34.170
isn't it very like I don't know anything.
Yeah.

1442
01:33:34.740 --> 01:33:35.573
<v 15>Well,</v>

1443
01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:40.920
<v 14>and that first you got to spend your own money.
Sure.
And commit to it,
you know,</v>

1444
01:33:41.090 --> 01:33:45.780
and you just see money going out.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's okay.
I mean,
no,
it's fine.

1445
01:33:45.781 --> 01:33:46.890
But it was,
yeah,

1446
01:33:47.050 --> 01:33:50.760
<v 15>I'm thinking we probably spent like a hundred thousand to start up with like</v>

1447
01:33:50.770 --> 01:33:54.520
lawyers and Chloe and then getting the club,
paying for the clothing.

1448
01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:59.200
But the hardest part is fine.
Good,
good manufacturers.
It's very,

1449
01:33:59.201 --> 01:34:03.910
very difficult and everyone's very,
very tight.
It's,
it was like a black hole.

1450
01:34:03.911 --> 01:34:06.250
I mean,
we didn't know anything.
We were fortunate to meet some,

1451
01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:11.380
some guys with a small clothing company of their own reached out to see if we

1452
01:34:11.381 --> 01:34:14.950
want to clothing and we end up being like,
hey,

1453
01:34:14.951 --> 01:34:16.830
maybe these guys can help us out in the,

1454
01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:19.240
so they helped point us in the right direction,

1455
01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:24.600
which basically helped us start developing the first kind of collection that you

1456
01:34:24.971 --> 01:34:27.010
will put together.
That was really successful.

1457
01:34:27.450 --> 01:34:31.200
<v 14>That's awesome.
How did that come about?</v>

1458
01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:35.340
Um,
I,
I don't know,
just a name.

1459
01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:40.830
It rolls off.
It's just a name we call it.
It's embarrassing.
We call it,

1460
01:34:40.860 --> 01:34:44.130
we call each other ted,
teddy bear,

1461
01:34:44.190 --> 01:34:47.590
whatever it,
teddy bear.
Yeah.

1462
01:34:48.810 --> 01:34:52.920
You're cute little nickname for you,
us.
So that's awesome.

1463
01:34:53.010 --> 01:34:56.170
We are trying to think of something with like a logo and Oh,

1464
01:34:56.210 --> 01:34:58.040
this is a perfect time to ask this.
Then

1465
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:01.350
<v 2>we'll see if Isla,
is it actual FTT art.
Oh,
for God's sake.</v>

1466
01:35:01.351 --> 01:35:05.360
So we appreciate that you love wore denim today on our show.

1467
01:35:05.450 --> 01:35:07.280
She knows so.

1468
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:12.710
So we've been having this debate in recent weeks.
Okay.

1469
01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:14.780
I just want to see where you stand on this.
Okay.

1470
01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:19.810
So let's say you're out and you come home and you get home and Ethan's leg,

1471
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:25.290
Hey ted,
you're like,
Hey,
Teddi I love you.
And
He,

1472
01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:29.810
and he's like,
uh,
he's like,
ah,
I gotta tell you something.
And you're like,

1473
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:33.050
did you forget to feed shredder?
And he's like,
no.

1474
01:35:33.650 --> 01:35:38.650
So I went to the bank and you know that guy who was up fucking Dick,

1475
01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:43.820
uh,
the parking attendant and you're like,
oh yeah,
that guy's such a dick.

1476
01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:45.213
He's like,
yeah.

1477
01:35:45.230 --> 01:35:50.230
So I saw him at trader Joe's and he was a dick there.

1478
01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:55.280
And anyway,
when I went back to my car,
his car was by the dumpster.

1479
01:35:56.120 --> 01:36:00.740
I stabbed him in the neck.
He's dead.
Um Huh.
Anyways,

1480
01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:02.480
the bodies in the trunk,

1481
01:36:04.090 --> 01:36:07.040
are you turning him in to the authorities?

1482
01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:11.820
<v 10>Huh?
I mean,
it is your husband</v>

1483
01:36:11.950 --> 01:36:15.160
<v 2>notice she's thinking about it,
right?
Yeah.
Please.
Fire.
No.</v>

1484
01:36:16.780 --> 01:36:20.290
Think about shredder.
Thinking about that your whole life,

1485
01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:22.060
everything you were used to.

1486
01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:24.433
<v 10>It's,</v>

1487
01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:27.220
<v 14>that's a really tough question.
The guys are real Dick,</v>

1488
01:36:27.221 --> 01:36:31.060
and you might have seen him be a dick.
I'll tell you what was my first response.

1489
01:36:31.090 --> 01:36:35.560
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
No,
I'm not doing it right.
That was my first ride or die for you.

1490
01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:40.180
Oh my God.
But it makes me think of,
it makes me wonder about myself,

1491
01:36:40.181 --> 01:36:43.510
like should I,
and was,
well,
the gut reaction,
what's the,

1492
01:36:43.511 --> 01:36:46.540
you live with the shame and the guilt,
but in that moment,
you know,

1493
01:36:46.810 --> 01:36:48.850
you torture yourself for the rest of eternity,

1494
01:36:48.851 --> 01:36:51.640
but you ride or die for your partner,
dude.
It's not even,

1495
01:36:52.210 --> 01:36:56.110
it's no question that you thought about that a little too long.

1496
01:36:56.111 --> 01:37:00.280
And I don't know.
Well,
I didn't actually kill somebody,

1497
01:37:00.281 --> 01:37:04.000
at least for the game.
Just say yes.
I mean,
I'm saying it's different.
These,

1498
01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:08.140
these checks are different.
So she is like,
yeah,

1499
01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:11.670
I'd course I'd fucking,
yeah,
she's ready to try to,

1500
01:37:11.730 --> 01:37:15.330
you attorney may want to know why he's tear.
Here's why.
And I hear the fuck.
Hey,

1501
01:37:15.331 --> 01:37:17.890
now you're shaming me for taking too long.
Here's the caveat.

1502
01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:23.050
If he accidentally kill somebody,
oops,
I hit a bicyclist.
Okay,
I'm gonna,

1503
01:37:23.170 --> 01:37:24.280
I'm gonna dig the ditch.

1504
01:37:24.281 --> 01:37:28.600
I'm the first one to find some core of what does it core core form hydrochloric

1505
01:37:28.601 --> 01:37:33.530
acid.
Chloric acid.
Fuck.
Yeah,
dude,
I'm right by accidental Detlef barriers.

1506
01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:37.210
However,
first degree lying in,
wait,
planning,

1507
01:37:37.211 --> 01:37:40.510
plotting somebody's murder and then not the guy you knew.

1508
01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:43.000
He's not the guy you thought he didn't.
You know?
That's right.

1509
01:37:43.001 --> 01:37:44.980
And also it means there's a switch that flipped.

1510
01:37:44.981 --> 01:37:48.710
Cause now he's acting on these impulses.
Poor impulse control,
thinking too much.

1511
01:37:48.930 --> 01:37:52.390
And,
and when is he going to turn that wrath on?

1512
01:37:52.391 --> 01:37:56.220
He's going to kill me on my children,
on my dogs,
please.

1513
01:37:56.250 --> 01:38:00.840
He's going to do this shit to us.
It's gotta be accidental.
Like,

1514
01:38:01.490 --> 01:38:05.370
Oh,
I just stabbed the guy to death.
Bang.
Yeah,
but there are different,

1515
01:38:05.371 --> 01:38:09.080
if you're it very realistically thank he's right in,

1516
01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:12.290
in reality that's probably,
see,
and that's where it,

1517
01:38:12.570 --> 01:38:15.120
but I'm thinking about it like in a love story.
Passionate.

1518
01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:20.420
That's where it should be.
Okay,
here's my mixers.

1519
01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:26.280
Like take your clothes off,
was thrown in the fire.
I got the,

1520
01:38:26.281 --> 01:38:29.370
I know that the place in Griffith Park,
we'll dump the body and I'm not,

1521
01:38:29.371 --> 01:38:32.700
and you're,
and you're like,
and I'm not even saying it hasn't happened before.

1522
01:38:34.110 --> 01:38:35.840
Absolutely not.
Wait Babe.
Okay,

1523
01:38:36.250 --> 01:38:39.820
<v 2>go to you.
And I'd be like,
you don't have fucking sales clerk.
Yeah.</v>

1524
01:38:39.850 --> 01:38:43.180
Down at the mall and Cinnabon.
She's been fucking eyeballing me.

1525
01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:45.190
Give me some shit.
Yeah.
Well,

1526
01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:50.080
the other day I waited for her in the parking lot and then I slit her Achilles

1527
01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:53.800
Tendon [inaudible] and then she collapsed the floor and then I fucking stab or

1528
01:38:53.801 --> 01:38:56.430
20 times and I put her in the trunk.
She's in the trunk right now.
Okay.

1529
01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:58.040
What do you say you're going to,

1530
01:38:58.041 --> 01:39:00.850
you're going to help me get rid of her 100% I wouldn't even think

1531
01:39:00.930 --> 01:39:05.040
<v 14>twice.
Let's see that the thing that Tom,
Tom is assuming that you,
it's you,</v>

1532
01:39:06.100 --> 01:39:07.310
your understanding

1533
01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:08.980
<v 15>that,
you know,</v>

1534
01:39:09.050 --> 01:39:11.390
<v 14>that's what your guy,
you know what didn't do that,</v>

1535
01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:15.260
so something's fucked up wrong and that he's saying that I'm,

1536
01:39:15.261 --> 01:39:19.450
they both on the same page.
You knew doing it.
Yeah.
Really your,

1537
01:39:20.450 --> 01:39:23.540
yeah.
You know what it makes me think about,

1538
01:39:23.690 --> 01:39:25.850
because I've been listening to stern a lot and he's been good

1539
01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:28.870
<v 15>on the whole,
uh,
the Julie Chen Moon.</v>

1540
01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:32.980
<v 14>Yeah.
And so he,
and so there's a lot of debate about like,
okay,</v>

1541
01:39:32.981 --> 01:39:33.510
we're talking about

1542
01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:37.220
<v 15>murder.
Well,
this guy just,
you know,
raped a bunch of people.</v>

1543
01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:39.320
<v 14>Maybe not allegedly.</v>

1544
01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:44.170
<v 15>Oh,
I'm sorry.
A ledger that,
what do I know?
Yeah.
But,
uh,
if,
uh,</v>

1545
01:39:44.171 --> 01:39:47.260
so like if you find out that Tom is a prolific writer,

1546
01:39:47.610 --> 01:39:52.450
<v 14>oh my God.
I know pretty bad that I would tell somehow.</v>

1547
01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:57.090
But,
but,
but that's true.
So the emotions of it are different.

1548
01:39:57.091 --> 01:40:01.650
If you look at it from Julie Chen Moonves.
Yeah.
It's like,
that's the guy,

1549
01:40:01.651 --> 01:40:05.700
you know,
but is it,
and what's true,
what's not right.
What's the what?

1550
01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:10.740
<v 2>But in which case you've confessed that you've plotted somebody murder and then</v>

1551
01:40:10.741 --> 01:40:12.230
you followed through.
Dude,
you're,

1552
01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:15.550
<v 14>I'd have to assume you fucking lost your damn mind sign.
Yeah.
But I'm fine.</v>

1553
01:40:15.551 --> 01:40:18.670
You're going to kill mine.
Let's go out to dinner when,
sorry about,

1554
01:40:19.020 --> 01:40:23.530
that's even scarier.
They are like,
what?
Of course you're not hungry.

1555
01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:30.260
Let's go get some shaky.
He's not a big deal for you.
That's way crazy.

1556
01:40:31.970 --> 01:40:35.070
I'm tired.
They had the,

1557
01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:39.880
I watched that documentary on Whitey Bulger,
you know,
the Boston,
uh,
he was,

1558
01:40:39.940 --> 01:40:44.050
he was 10,
10 most wanted for 20 years.
Right.
She,
James,
Whitey Bulger.

1559
01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:47.590
I love his name.
Yeah.
He ran and watch this kind of stuff.
No,
he ran the winner.

1560
01:40:47.970 --> 01:40:52.090
Normative.
Yeah,
me too.
The movie black mass,
easily black mass,

1561
01:40:52.091 --> 01:40:54.430
which everyone thought was about asshole was actually

1562
01:40:54.430 --> 01:40:57.610
<v 0>about James bought Johnny Depp played him.
Anyway,</v>

1563
01:40:58.090 --> 01:41:03.090
he was a ruthless Boston gangster and he ran what they called the winter hill

1564
01:41:03.401 --> 01:41:07.690
gang up there and they,
his uh,
one of his partners who's like,

1565
01:41:07.691 --> 01:41:11.470
was it government informed?
You know,
witness said that.
He was like,
yeah,

1566
01:41:11.471 --> 01:41:16.140
there's this thing about,
he goes,
I never saw Jimmy James Bulger.

1567
01:41:16.810 --> 01:41:20.740
Never saw Jimmy and such a good mood.
Then when he killed somebody,

1568
01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:22.540
he would just be in the best mood for,

1569
01:41:22.541 --> 01:41:24.740
can take a long nap and he would just be in the,
yeah,

1570
01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:29.090
<v 14>the valve.
The tension.
The,</v>

1571
01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:32.000
the guy who killed his partner,

1572
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:34.640
one of his like partners stepdaughters and he was like,

1573
01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:38.250
we buried her in the basement.
He's like,
ah,
Jimmy wasn't the best move for days.

1574
01:41:40.270 --> 01:41:44.480
Say,
well no,
if killing people made you feel that good.

1575
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:48.050
Yeah.
Battle.
I know what I mean.
It's not like to participate.

1576
01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:52.990
I think the thing is you got to learn to forget.
I need really suck that course.

1577
01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:57.760
I mean,
Shit,
Christina,
you need to learn to forgive.
And Christine,
Christine,

1578
01:41:57.790 --> 01:42:01.910
you learn to forgive and there's nobody better to tell you how to learn to

1579
01:42:01.911 --> 01:42:04.050
forgive.
Oh,
right.
Okay.
Oh,
what the fuck?

1580
01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:09.400
<v 13>Thinking about forgiveness and did a deep journey for me because I've had to</v>

1581
01:42:09.621 --> 01:42:14.621
look into the shadows of my own heart and understand how I've heard other people

1582
01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:17.840
and forgive myself,

1583
01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:20.880
<v 14>she's naked in bed.
Yes.
Thank you.
Okay.</v>

1584
01:42:21.150 --> 01:42:25.290
Why is this really everyone,
everyone in this family,

1585
01:42:25.450 --> 01:42:29.820
spouses different the Smith's,
right?
Yes,
yes.
Different lanes of wisdom for any

1586
01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:34.380
<v 13>wrong accident might have committed or any pain that I might have</v>

1587
01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:37.960
<v 14>cause what did I just got a makeup on.
Her hair is done.</v>

1588
01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:39.600
She just always

1589
01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:44.160
<v 0>has,
um,
sort of insight into,
you know,</v>

1590
01:42:44.190 --> 01:42:47.370
spiritual and psychological.

1591
01:42:47.610 --> 01:42:51.750
<v 14>She says her son famously does as well.
He also shares thoughts.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1592
01:42:51.900 --> 01:42:55.800
Which is fine,
but maybe not naked in bed on Instagram

1593
01:42:57.220 --> 01:42:58.840
<v 13>and forgiveness for myself.</v>

1594
01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:04.560
<v 14>Hmm.
It's such an unnecessary forgiveness or items.
Yeah.</v>

1595
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:07.710
Um,
I don't know about you,
but I'm obsessed with Instagram.

1596
01:43:09.780 --> 01:43:14.250
I like Instagram peoples.
It's a window into how people want to be perceived.

1597
01:43:14.251 --> 01:43:17.760
That's why I love it.
It's psychologically very fascinating to Instagram.

1598
01:43:17.761 --> 01:43:22.080
Sucks me in more.
I,
I'm on like a full social media detox.
Sure.

1599
01:43:22.081 --> 01:43:27.030
I have like even I have youtube,
Twitter and Instagram.
Not on my phone.

1600
01:43:27.390 --> 01:43:29.580
Wow.
It's uh,
just,

1601
01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:33.170
I just think it's good to just so you,
I don't be,

1602
01:43:33.171 --> 01:43:35.340
that guy is just a personal thing.
Yeah.

1603
01:43:35.341 --> 01:43:38.730
You were smart about in on my phone cause I feel like I don't have as much of a

1604
01:43:38.731 --> 01:43:42.080
problem with it.
I can control it more.
So if we need,

1605
01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:44.960
I think can do it on my spreadsheet.
That's how you do it.
It's called the,

1606
01:43:44.961 --> 01:43:48.120
it's self protection.
You know what I mean?
If there's something you need to know,

1607
01:43:48.450 --> 01:43:50.940
well that means I gotta go and show you all of these things.
Jesus.

1608
01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:52.280
I love watching the ship,

1609
01:43:52.890 --> 01:43:57.860
my internal emotional life terrain on the planet.

1610
01:43:57.861 --> 01:44:02.000
She flexing right now,
dad's home.
I know I have a Sahara desert within me.

1611
01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:04.100
That place where,
where are you?

1612
01:44:04.130 --> 01:44:07.460
She's in like a size that's probably her home bathroom

1613
01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:11.660
hasn't Arctica.

1614
01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:16.800
I have an Antarctica in me when I have hurts that run so deep that my compassion

1615
01:44:19.131 --> 01:44:22.430
and my understanding and my lungs is,
is frozen.

1616
01:44:22.431 --> 01:44:24.470
It looks like she's got Vaseline everywhere.
She looks great.

1617
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:27.500
Why don't you let the record show to the audience?

1618
01:44:27.501 --> 01:44:31.940
I just opened up a bottle of water and I refreshed Isla and Ethan's glasses.

1619
01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.000
It's Ethan.
We did notice that.
Thank you Ethan.
Eila.

1620
01:44:35.890 --> 01:44:38.540
And I was so thoughtful.
That was a generous,
caring,

1621
01:44:38.541 --> 01:44:41.220
beautiful moment that only a mother could have been.
Yeah,

1622
01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:44.650
<v 2>I don't water champion and a water change.
Um,</v>

1623
01:44:44.710 --> 01:44:48.430
so because Christina thinks I am a violent psychopath,

1624
01:44:48.850 --> 01:44:52.990
I'm going to be taking this a psychopathy scale test.
So,
uh,

1625
01:44:52.991 --> 01:44:54.790
one of our listeners sent it in.

1626
01:44:54.970 --> 01:44:58.540
You say I watched too many murder shows so I won't go through the whole thing.

1627
01:44:58.541 --> 01:45:02.080
But basically I put a level of internet,

1628
01:45:02.081 --> 01:45:05.410
like on a scale of one to five,
one meaning there's no match,

1629
01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:08.770
five meaning a very good match.
You calculate the total score.

1630
01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:11.980
I'll do it after the show and we'll get back with my total score.
No,

1631
01:45:12.010 --> 01:45:16.390
but it says things like,
just to give the listeners an idea.
For instance,

1632
01:45:16.391 --> 01:45:18.970
number one,
success is based on survival of the fittest.

1633
01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:23.020
I am not concerned about the losers.
That would be a strong match.
Fine.

1634
01:45:23.021 --> 01:45:23.854
Number two,

1635
01:45:24.250 --> 01:45:28.660
<v 14>I have stabbed the attendant in the parking lot down.
Five,
five,
five.</v>

1636
01:45:30.130 --> 01:45:34.300
<v 2>My main purpose in life is to get as many goodies as I can.
Hard five,</v>

1637
01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:38.680
I'm making a lot of monies.
Most important goal,
10 plus plus.
All right,

1638
01:45:38.681 --> 01:45:41.890
so I'll do them later and we'll psychopath scale.
I'm,
yeah,

1639
01:45:42.010 --> 01:45:47.010
I feel like if you're a psychopath you would lie on this thing probably.

1640
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:50.800
Yeah.
Here's the,
I think the flock,
cause I read this over before,

1641
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:52.720
is that tried to be honest with it though.

1642
01:45:53.230 --> 01:45:57.190
Most humans aren't this self aware where you would be like I enjoy manipulating

1643
01:45:57.191 --> 01:46:00.640
other people's feelings.
Like you're in denial about the stuff that you do.

1644
01:46:00.690 --> 01:46:05.290
You wouldn't know,
but there is probably a way that you could,

1645
01:46:06.750 --> 01:46:09.790
you,
you could answer it somewhat,
you know,

1646
01:46:10.630 --> 01:46:15.630
justify to yourself more like in a way that would make sense to you instead of

1647
01:46:16.751 --> 01:46:18.670
saying,
I just enjoy it.
Right.

1648
01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:23.630
You would think there's a reason to me like for instance,
some,
some real like,

1649
01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:26.560
like let's say somebody who is definitely off the charts.
Yes.

1650
01:46:26.561 --> 01:46:29.860
On this could read things like love is Ora overrated.

1651
01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:33.110
<v 14>Yeah.
Hundred percent.
Yeah.
And you know,
they get up,
they trick them.</v>

1652
01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:35.900
I often desire a really clever scam.
Oh yeah.

1653
01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:38.600
I love a good scan.

1654
01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:44.330
When I get frustrated I often let off steam by blowing my top.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1655
01:46:44.331 --> 01:46:45.470
Wait,
what the fuck does that mean

1656
01:46:46.030 --> 01:46:49.630
<v 2>that you get,
you get blow your top.
Hey,
yeah.
You saying crazy shit.</v>

1657
01:46:50.210 --> 01:46:51.930
<v 14>This is like an old timey</v>

1658
01:46:55.560 --> 01:47:00.190
blow your top.
But yeah,
I don't see this.

1659
01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:02.240
You said you watching a lot of murder shows.

1660
01:47:02.690 --> 01:47:06.810
I have noticed there's so many of them.
There's so many people are watching them.

1661
01:47:07.310 --> 01:47:10.680
So it's not just you.
It's like I've tried to tell they're fascinating.

1662
01:47:10.681 --> 01:47:14.970
They're great stuff.
It is not just him.
However,
if you look at it,

1663
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:19.590
Netflix Queue,
it's exclusively three primary categories,
murder,

1664
01:47:19.890 --> 01:47:21.600
Hitler and drug wars.

1665
01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:25.680
And there's very little outside of those three points of interest,

1666
01:47:25.730 --> 01:47:30.420
which is traveling to me,
I would say actually very misleading.

1667
01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:35.680
Lot more drug lords,
crime.
Very Little Hitler.

1668
01:47:36.350 --> 01:47:40.350
So boring.
So boring.
Who Cares about Hitler?
Yeah,

1669
01:47:40.470 --> 01:47:43.320
that's the thing is here's the thing,
we get it.
You get it.

1670
01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:46.410
And it's also like I tried to watch one of them.

1671
01:47:46.450 --> 01:47:48.870
That's the last one I've tried to watch was a few months ago.

1672
01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:53.190
You know the footage,
the narrator.
It's all feels very redundant.

1673
01:47:53.191 --> 01:47:56.460
So what's your jam?
So you're saying you're over it now?

1674
01:47:56.580 --> 01:48:00.230
I do watch a lot of the drivers today.
I wish there'd be a new Hitler ready.

1675
01:48:00.231 --> 01:48:03.420
Right.
Drug Lords waiting for part two.

1676
01:48:03.570 --> 01:48:08.500
I just want to new dictator really into Janice.

1677
01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:12.750
You know,
somebody to kind of take the reins.
Some excitement.
Stalin's.

1678
01:48:12.751 --> 01:48:16.650
Interesting.
Maybe there's not as much footage on him.
Not that I've seen.

1679
01:48:16.651 --> 01:48:20.530
I've seen a lot of Stalin Pol Pot.
Really?

1680
01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:25.080
He's got some good media.
Um,
and I feel like the whole Kim family,

1681
01:48:25.081 --> 01:48:29.420
I wish they weren't so reclusive.
Let some more cameras then.
That'd be,
yeah.

1682
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.690
I mean this little guy,
when he off the uncle,

1683
01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:35.610
there should be a whole documentary just on that.

1684
01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:39.630
You remember when Trump did that?
And he goes,
he was talking,

1685
01:48:39.631 --> 01:48:43.260
this is like a year ago.
He's like,
he's like just Kim Jong Un guy.
They'll fell.

1686
01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:47.130
He's like with the uncle,
like he was like giggling about it.

1687
01:48:47.900 --> 01:48:51.330
It's crazy.
And that's the bad press.

1688
01:48:51.331 --> 01:48:55.410
Trump at his best as Matt little rocket man.
Part of him was like,

1689
01:48:55.980 --> 01:48:59.160
you got to respect this guy.
It wasn't like,
this is reprehensible.

1690
01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:01.670
He's on this scale.
He's like,

1691
01:49:01.710 --> 01:49:06.040
do you ever admire other dictators murdering their family members?
Five

1692
01:49:07.660 --> 01:49:09.630
total.
Easy peasy.

1693
01:49:10.250 --> 01:49:13.890
Goes to sleep first between the two of you just want to be fall asleep before

1694
01:49:13.891 --> 01:49:17.910
the other and it used to be make flip flops.
You used to be mostly me,

1695
01:49:17.911 --> 01:49:22.350
but lately it's Ethan.
I used to always outlast you,

1696
01:49:22.351 --> 01:49:24.960
but lately I don't know what flipped,
something flipped flopped.

1697
01:49:25.260 --> 01:49:28.860
And do you watch television while she goes to sleep?
We always watch TV.

1698
01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:31.260
What's your jam?
What do you watch when she goes to sleep?

1699
01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:35.370
That's the real child falls asleep and Jani me.
No.

1700
01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:37.980
Well sometimes if I have a good one to watch it,
I like anime.

1701
01:49:37.981 --> 01:49:40.170
I'm not embarrassed to admit it or not embarrassed.

1702
01:49:40.171 --> 01:49:45.060
You just watch video games or chicks love that taught anime and video games.

1703
01:49:45.061 --> 01:49:48.910
Right?
That's fine.
You taking a jab at him?

1704
01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:51.940
Yes.
Nightmare

1705
01:49:53.740 --> 01:49:57.220
for her to fall asleep now see that's nice.
That's considerate.

1706
01:49:57.710 --> 01:50:02.290
I mean first of all I eat,
she goes to bed like fucking third grader,
you know,

1707
01:50:03.550 --> 01:50:08.550
good by like nine 30 but then I have to wake up and you got two kids

1708
01:50:08.651 --> 01:50:12.160
breastfeeding and all that shit.
Tell me what,
how,
what's your schedule?
So then,

1709
01:50:12.161 --> 01:50:16.450
okay,
so I tried to go to,
I pump at 10 I fall asleep.
I have to set my alarm.

1710
01:50:16.451 --> 01:50:21.070
I wake up at like two to pump at 2:00 AM and then I wake up at 6:00 AM to

1711
01:50:21.071 --> 01:50:25.570
breastfeed the kitty again.
So I don't sleep.
And those are like long sessions.

1712
01:50:25.571 --> 01:50:29.950
You're fully awake,
fully.
It wasn't fully awake at your weight.

1713
01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:33.990
And do you get resentful that Tom doesn't breastfeed?
I do,
yeah.

1714
01:50:34.210 --> 01:50:38.380
Especially with all the time.
I'm like,
why?
How come your tits don't make milk?

1715
01:50:38.410 --> 01:50:43.300
Like I just tried.
No,
we could try.
I wish.

1716
01:50:43.540 --> 01:50:45.550
I don't understand why the male partner has zero.

1717
01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:49.210
You want to put them on there today to provide for the caring of the baby.

1718
01:50:49.540 --> 01:50:50.373
You know,

1719
01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:56.120
let's carry tits and I'm saying this for resentful court and the first kid

1720
01:50:57.641 --> 01:51:01.330
especially,
I really hated him second baby or like this is just how it goes,

1721
01:51:01.450 --> 01:51:06.300
but then shit flips when that baby is a toddler and now Ellis only wants that.

1722
01:51:06.660 --> 01:51:10.420
That's why I'm like,
oh now it's your turn to be like the center.

1723
01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:11.771
It flips now.

1724
01:51:11.771 --> 01:51:15.190
Do you feel bad that you can't breastfeed or do you sleep peacefully and

1725
01:51:17.770 --> 01:51:21.700
broken up about it?
Well,
for both of your benefits,

1726
01:51:21.701 --> 01:51:22.840
because you are broken up,

1727
01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:29.870
you put your milk in and he can wake up at 2:00 AM you put your free pump milk

1728
01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:33.730
in the tet,
the baby can breastfeed from this.
One of our listeners,

1729
01:51:36.830 --> 01:51:39.720
we would really like to publicly shame,
you know,

1730
01:51:39.790 --> 01:51:43.810
all different types of assholes in public.
And one is,
uh,
just,
you know,

1731
01:51:43.811 --> 01:51:46.390
we encourage people to park like decent people.

1732
01:51:46.780 --> 01:51:50.890
So one of our listeners sent in this fucking guy.

1733
01:51:51.370 --> 01:51:54.520
So the question,
I mean,
look at this job,
the questionnaires,
the line,

1734
01:51:54.521 --> 01:51:57.550
just so you know,
there's the line here.
Fuck,

1735
01:51:57.551 --> 01:52:02.020
I have an alternate explanation because sometimes it's happened to me on,

1736
01:52:02.021 --> 01:52:05.650
I feel bad.
The question is who parked for first?
That's true.

1737
01:52:05.710 --> 01:52:08.680
That is sometimes you're forced to park like an asshole and then the other

1738
01:52:08.681 --> 01:52:11.290
asshole leaves in.
You look like the asshole.
That's very true.

1739
01:52:12.710 --> 01:52:17.020
But it's pulled in or it looks like it's impossible,

1740
01:52:18.860 --> 01:52:21.430
right?
Yeah.
I mean,
unless,

1741
01:52:21.910 --> 01:52:26.200
unless before this car to the left,
that's over here.
So that's what I'm thinking.

1742
01:52:26.620 --> 01:52:29.980
Well,
this guy took,
I mean,
look at that.

1743
01:52:31.910 --> 01:52:35.650
So he left them a note on the car.
Hey asshole,

1744
01:52:35.710 --> 01:52:39.400
I wish whatever cunt bag you've came out of would have taught you how to park.

1745
01:52:39.420 --> 01:52:43.600
I wish you the most extreme explosive diarrhea known to man.
Good luck.

1746
01:52:43.750 --> 01:52:47.230
Love white hot.
Come dump piss on me,
beat me.
She's like,

1747
01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:52.450
you know,
it probably wasn't asshole par because everyone probably does.

1748
01:52:52.510 --> 01:52:53.700
Everyone's really loud.

1749
01:52:54.550 --> 01:52:58.350
I guess where I'm staying United is from where we finally found out,

1750
01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:00.940
I'm guessing Mexico putting money.

1751
01:53:01.710 --> 01:53:04.370
<v 0>We saw a video of this guy and he,</v>

1752
01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:08.850
he does his version of staying alive.
Can we show that course?
Of course.

1753
01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:10.113
<v 4>Oh Wow.</v>

1754
01:53:16.450 --> 01:53:18.470
So you've been that even line.

1755
01:53:18.980 --> 01:53:19.813
<v 14>Wow.</v>

1756
01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:24.040
<v 4>Sounds like it might be his last.</v>

1757
01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:32.870
<v 0>So yeah.
First Time we saw this was this video.
Since then,</v>

1758
01:53:32.871 --> 01:53:35.900
we've been sent dozens of videos of him doing youtube.

1759
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:40.990
Oh well everyone just like has like will wherever they see this guy will,

1760
01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:46.550
he'll do his stay,
United States,
United States,
and then they'll send it into us.

1761
01:53:46.551 --> 01:53:49.250
So we played it over and over.
We're like,
where the fuck is this?

1762
01:53:49.610 --> 01:53:53.450
And we saw some writing out at a restaurant.
He was in front of that.

1763
01:53:53.451 --> 01:53:56.690
I looked up and it wasn't Spain.
We were like,
oh,
maybe he's Spanish.

1764
01:53:56.691 --> 01:54:00.440
Turns out our man dying to know is from,

1765
01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:04.620
his name is Omar Jackson,
but that,
that,
and he is from Bata.

1766
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:05.630
He's from Morocco.

1767
01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:11.160
<v 14>I want it to say I signed something Middle Eastern and Yep.</v>

1768
01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:15.250
No sway was like if swag yeah.
Interests there,

1769
01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:19.650
but not to,
I mean sweet potato in that Subaru.
Yeah,
it does.

1770
01:54:19.860 --> 01:54:23.550
<v 0>Yeah.
Uh,
Omar Potato.
Um,
anyway,</v>

1771
01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:29.390
this is a,
yeah,
that's it.
He,
we've been,
we,
they keep sending us videos of him.

1772
01:54:30.690 --> 01:54:34.400
<v 14>Well God bless us.
He's the raddest.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1773
01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:37.040
That's actually a talent man.
I mean when you watch him,

1774
01:54:37.041 --> 01:54:39.020
I pay money to watch him do that.

1775
01:54:39.110 --> 01:54:43.090
Madison Square Garden might sell out.
Uh,

1776
01:54:43.130 --> 01:54:46.250
cause we've looked at o'clock in the afternoon.
What about scatting?

1777
01:54:46.251 --> 01:54:47.270
Do you guys know what that is?

1778
01:54:47.850 --> 01:54:51.290
But before I know there's two meanings to scatting.

1779
01:54:51.291 --> 01:54:54.740
One involves shitting and there's like beep up,
right?

1780
01:54:54.830 --> 01:54:56.390
So there's people like Ski Dubai.

1781
01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:01.520
Like I would rather watch that guy do the staying alive song 10 times in a row.

1782
01:55:01.550 --> 01:55:04.310
I didn't watch 20 minutes of scatting.
Sure.

1783
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:07.870
You don't want scatting are you like him?
No,
I liked compare staying alive guy,

1784
01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.610
because we even sent videos of people's scatting and we're like,

1785
01:55:10.611 --> 01:55:14.450
if you were to watch that is a show,
which one would you go to?

1786
01:55:14.451 --> 01:55:17.480
That guy's a legend.
He's out in the desert of all places.

1787
01:55:17.481 --> 01:55:19.730
So hot missing teeth.

1788
01:55:19.731 --> 01:55:24.400
So if someone's directly recording him and sending you guys always nine,

1789
01:55:24.460 --> 01:55:28.670
it's online.
All those videos are submitted for,
but I think there's,

1790
01:55:28.671 --> 01:55:33.240
there was a listener who actually saw him though.
So lucky.
Yeah.
Yeah,

1791
01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:36.260
yeah.
It's like a rare Pokemon.
He really is.

1792
01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:38.700
<v 0>Yeah,
he really is.
He,
um,</v>

1793
01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:42.450
and he always does his version of staying alive

1794
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:46.810
<v 14>and then they send us a picture of him with teeth.
No,</v>

1795
01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:51.660
I almost don't want to see it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's see it.
Oh Man.
Where's the,

1796
01:55:53.110 --> 01:55:56.430
it's going to ruin everything.
I know him one way.

1797
01:55:57.510 --> 01:55:59.790
Staying alive teeth.
Let's see.
She dare.

1798
01:56:00.450 --> 01:56:04.310
Don't Joe Dad staying alive,
but my gang bang.
Uh,

1799
01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:08.370
what that bank or what that day do you guys have local Weirdos and your

1800
01:56:08.371 --> 01:56:12.960
neighborhood like,
um,
yeah,
they're,
they're not wacky.
They're all scary.

1801
01:56:13.830 --> 01:56:16.560
What do you got?
We had a,
we had a bearded lady in our own neighborhood.

1802
01:56:17.620 --> 01:56:22.080
So you guys are in a really,
it's a nice,
ours is closer,

1803
01:56:22.081 --> 01:56:25.080
is like really close to Ventura.
So there's a lot.

1804
01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:26.810
<v 19>Uh,</v>

1805
01:56:27.550 --> 01:56:31.180
<v 14>we'll get like two homeless guys who will always be there.</v>

1806
01:56:31.660 --> 01:56:35.440
There's one specific corner across from cvs that has always covered in shit,

1807
01:56:35.441 --> 01:56:40.120
puke and garbage.
Yeah.
And I mean like,
that's right.

1808
01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:44.720
That's right.
There's like one spot.
Cool.
That's we'll walk by every day.
Yeah.

1809
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:48.520
And um,
there's just,
yeah,
there's some transients that,

1810
01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:53.590
the thing about transients tonight,
I hate being like judgemental because,

1811
01:56:53.620 --> 01:56:54.850
you know,
I feel bad for,

1812
01:56:55.180 --> 01:56:57.370
I wish we took better care for homeless people in this country,

1813
01:56:57.371 --> 01:57:00.570
but then that scares me about these transients is that I just feel like they're

1814
01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:05.480
loose cannons.
Like they're unpredictable illness.
Yes.
I'm predictable.
You know,

1815
01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:07.750
a woman,
it can have a dollar the next minute

1816
01:57:10.110 --> 01:57:10.943
<v 19>fucking</v>

1817
01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:13.770
<v 0>yeah,
the transients you're saying?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.</v>

1818
01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:17.300
I've been in a little coffee shop with a,

1819
01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:21.900
a guy walked somebody in,
it was like,
get him whatever he wants.
And um,

1820
01:57:22.530 --> 01:57:24.720
the guy goes,
oh yeah,
thanks man.

1821
01:57:25.020 --> 01:57:27.600
And he orders a sandwich and a coffee.

1822
01:57:28.230 --> 01:57:32.580
Then he goes over and I watched him open the coffee and I'm just standing there

1823
01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:37.260
and takes a packet of sugar and he puts it in and then a second,

1824
01:57:38.130 --> 01:57:40.360
and then a third,
fourth,

1825
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.060
he puts in like 13 packs of sugar.
And I was like,
whoa.

1826
01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:49.320
I didn't really fascinated.
It was like,
Holy Shit.
And then the guy goes,

1827
01:57:49.321 --> 01:57:51.600
here's your sandwich.
He's like,
you're not gonna fuck with me.

1828
01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:54.430
And flips out of the guy says he's trying to poison him.

1829
01:57:54.710 --> 01:57:58.930
<v 14>Well,
here's my sandwich.
He throws a sandwich to the back of that.
Ah,
Shit.</v>

1830
01:57:58.970 --> 01:58:00.920
It's fucked up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Every,

1831
01:58:00.950 --> 01:58:04.370
I feel like we tried to do that to one guy and he was like,

1832
01:58:04.580 --> 01:58:07.850
it was going to wait outside the restaurant and we went and got food for him and

1833
01:58:07.851 --> 01:58:11.220
we'll come back out and he's not there.
Yeah.
That happens a lot.

1834
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:16.070
There's like paranoia,
you know you're mentally ill.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1835
01:58:16.130 --> 01:58:20.040
But then there's entertaining homeless.
This is not what the teeth

1836
01:58:21.930 --> 01:58:23.010
<v 20>does.
He do any other songs.</v>

1837
01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:27.000
He just trying to hype himself up because life's tough.

1838
01:58:27.110 --> 01:58:28.610
<v 14>I'm literally staying alive.</v>

1839
01:58:32.180 --> 01:58:35.870
Went Bang it wet bed.
I love that.

1840
01:58:35.871 --> 01:58:39.580
He just does the sounds of the words seven thing.

1841
01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:45.820
He doesn't speak English.
I used to do that too.

1842
01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:47.750
And you go stay United States United States.

1843
01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:54.140
Did you sound out like things that like sounded like like in your head?
Yeah,

1844
01:58:54.141 --> 01:58:58.240
definitely.
That's,
yeah.
When we first met you look barely spoke English.

1845
01:58:58.780 --> 01:59:02.290
We had difficulty communicating.
Yeah.
So wait,

We know that.
Yes.

01:59:10.850 --> 01:59:15.140
And you're feeling romantic.
It's a nice setting.
Yeah.

1849
01:59:16.930 --> 01:59:21.770

I'll have that.
Hey,

1850
01:59:21.771 --> 01:59:25.210
you know,
we just hit it off.
We liked each other's company obviously.

1851
01:59:25.250 --> 01:59:29.900
It wasn't like in a romantic way really.
I was interested.
Okay.

1852
01:59:29.901 --> 01:59:34.550
Yeah.
I wanted to fuck.
I think I knew that too,
but,

1853
01:59:34.551 --> 01:59:37.700
well he's going back to America,
but you know this guy,
you know,

1854
01:59:37.701 --> 01:59:42.290

She's,

she's not separate girl to give it up.
She did.

1855
01:59:42.291 --> 01:59:45.830
She's not looking for cheap fuck.
She's not looking for it too,
which is great.

1856
01:59:45.831 --> 01:59:47.730
I like,
you know,
so you just do it.
You got up.

1857
01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:51.620
I wasn't like aggressively trying to,
you know,
have sex with her.
No,
no,
no.

1858
01:59:51.710 --> 01:59:55.840
You knew that you had a good girl on hand though.
Yeah.
She's a sweet girl.
Yeah.
I,

1859
01:59:56.090 --> 01:59:59.000
you know,
which I liked.
So how do you send like,
wait,
how,

1860
01:59:59.060 --> 02:00:02.420
how soon after the meeting do you lead?
You only see her once we were there,

1861
02:00:02.421 --> 02:00:06.830
we were together for a week.
It was a week kind of activity,
but a hanging out.

1862
02:00:07.010 --> 02:00:10.700
We're hanging out all the time when we were there together and we just stayed in

1863
02:00:10.701 --> 02:00:12.800
touch via email and Skype

1864
02:00:13.510 --> 02:00:14.260
<v 18>and face.</v>

1865
02:00:14.260 --> 02:00:19.260
I didn't know what Facebook was and Ethan and all the Americans told the

1866
02:00:20.361 --> 02:00:24.040
Israelis,
you guys to get Facebook and they're like,
what is that?

1867
02:00:24.770 --> 02:00:29.050
Everyone is over 10 years ago.
It was kind of when the,

1868
02:00:29.051 --> 02:00:32.320
it was like a trip,
you know,
we were a group so everyone was like,
oh,

1869
02:00:32.321 --> 02:00:35.350
it's sad that it's ending.
So let's all exchange emails.

1870
02:00:36.070 --> 02:00:39.430
But I guess most of them probably didn't actually stay in contact.

1871
02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:42.240
And we did.
We did.

1872
02:00:42.530 --> 02:00:45.790
And did you send a message messages like you're trying to smash or like that

1873
02:00:45.791 --> 02:00:50.290
kind of thing.
She know.
She know.
And then after,
so you go back,

1874
02:00:50.291 --> 02:00:52.630
you see her just via Skype,
email stuff.

1875
02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:54.220
When do you actually physically see each other?
Yeah,

1876
02:00:54.220 --> 02:00:59.010
<v 14>it was a while there.
I had a boyfriend year.
She wasn't even done yet.</v>

1877
02:00:59.060 --> 02:01:03.470
<v 18>I just came to,
I came here for two months and I went back and then another year.</v>

1878
02:01:04.530 --> 02:01:07.830
<v 14>Yeah.
Well I was persistent man.
Where are you?
Right.</v>

1879
02:01:07.860 --> 02:01:12.140
Because a guy like me gets a girl like that interested.

1880
02:01:12.620 --> 02:01:15.930
You follow that thread?
Yeah.
As far as it'll take you.

1881
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:21.080
<v 18>And that's what made it actually the fact that here was so persistent because I,</v>

1882
02:01:21.290 --> 02:01:24.260
I never thought it would be possible.
I don't know.
And then he's like,

1883
02:01:24.290 --> 02:01:29.060
I'm coming to Israel,
dude,
I'm moving.
I'm,
I came here first.
Oh,
you did?
Okay.

1884
02:01:29.090 --> 02:01:31.820
When I finished the army,
uh,
everyone in Israel,

1885
02:01:31.821 --> 02:01:34.340
he was really likes to take a trip somewhere after the army,

1886
02:01:34.370 --> 02:01:37.580
after the army for like is the commitment two years,
four years.

1887
02:01:37.710 --> 02:01:42.410
It's too for women or tree for three.
Four men.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1888
02:01:43.290 --> 02:01:44.730
<v 14>I didn't serve,
I'm,
I agree about it.</v>

1889
02:01:45.660 --> 02:01:50.490
<v 18>So I finished the army and then I was like,
well everyone takes a trip somewhere.</v>

1890
02:01:50.491 --> 02:01:54.990
I'll go,
I know where he is.
I'll just,
and I had a brother right here in la too,

1891
02:01:55.380 --> 02:01:57.030
so I was like,
I'll make that my tray.

1892
02:01:57.150 --> 02:02:01.860
And I like from the first moment moved in with him.

1893
02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:06.500
When you look,
so you were like essentially visiting,
but you moved in?
Yeah,

1894
02:02:06.570 --> 02:02:09.670
it went from like Skype relationship delivering together.
Okay.

1895
02:02:10.820 --> 02:02:13.300
<v 14>And then by then we'd like,
look,
I'm trying to,
now I'm trying to get it,</v>

1896
02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:18.190
I'm trying.
It was honestly the hand movements.
It was,
yeah,

1897
02:02:18.750 --> 02:02:22.310
there was Tom,
you know what I'm saying?
Yes.
And you know what I'm saying?
We had,

1898
02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:22.920
we did have,

1899
02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:27.920
we probably did have a consummated probably the relationship that evening.

1900
02:02:28.370 --> 02:02:33.280
Ah,
but what we knew that we didn't know that that was actually,
yeah,

1901
02:02:33.390 --> 02:02:38.130
cause either had a boyfriend for a while,
but yeah.

1902
02:02:38.420 --> 02:02:39.253
Um,

1903
02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:42.790
<v 18>it was almost like,
man,
it was almost like my attempt to like,</v>

1904
02:02:43.150 --> 02:02:47.140
let me really see if I really can have an Israeli guy and make my life simpler

1905
02:02:47.141 --> 02:02:51.800
because this whole thing is going to be so complicated.
Sure.
Everyone.
Yeah,

1906
02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:56.470
and like my parents hated the idea

1907
02:02:56.740 --> 02:02:59.320
<v 14>that you were seeing that they like you're on the,
I don't know much about your,</v>

1908
02:02:59.470 --> 02:03:02.360
the,
your boyfriend,
you had an Israel,
oh,
let's,
let's talk about it.

1909
02:03:02.361 --> 02:03:02.990
Was he interested

1910
02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:07.850
<v 2>then?
He was okay.
No,
I see like Mossad,
like really?</v>

1911
02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:12.570
<v 14>No.
I mean we were all just like out the army.
No one was doing anything like six,</v>

1912
02:03:12.580 --> 02:03:17.520
four
ripped.
No,
he was,
I think I read,
I saw a picture of him.

1913
02:03:17.521 --> 02:03:19.810
He was,
he was ripped,
right?

1914
02:03:20.330 --> 02:03:22.430
<v 18>No,
he's okay.
He's not a thing.</v>

1915
02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:26.950
<v 14>Not like,
oh he wasn't a 10 she's like a nine is not a 10.
Okay.</v>

1916
02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:30.760
What was he on a scale of one to 10 what was he on a scale of one to 10 who's a

1917
02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:33.210
10 no,
I dunno.
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

1918
02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:35.410
It was embarrassed about this stuff for celebrities.

1919
02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:39.950
I don't even know who's a 10 I don't care about people based on their loans.

1920
02:03:39.970 --> 02:03:42.580
That's how I ended up with her.
You see,
I found that girl,

1921
02:03:42.581 --> 02:03:45.670
she's like I don't care about looks,
need a couple of good looking guys.

1922
02:03:45.671 --> 02:03:48.580
And they were like the dullness guys I ever met.

1923
02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:52.490
<v 2>When I went out to check this out,</v>

1924
02:03:52.580 --> 02:03:57.580
I went out with Christina and her ex boyfriend to celebrate him passing his bar

1925
02:03:58.551 --> 02:04:00.980
exam.
Like,
cause I knew her as a friend.

1926
02:04:01.010 --> 02:04:04.580
So I was part of the celebrate while you guys were dating.
So I,

1927
02:04:04.970 --> 02:04:08.630
while she was dating,
I was dating yet we,

1928
02:04:08.631 --> 02:04:12.350
Tom and I were just friends and from doing comments from doing stand up yet.

1929
02:04:12.380 --> 02:04:16.010
And so my ex boyfriend had just passed the bar exam and we were all going to the

1930
02:04:16.011 --> 02:04:19.550
Strip club across from him first we did dinner,

1931
02:04:19.710 --> 02:04:22.250
went through a big dinner first.
Oh right,
right,
right.

1932
02:04:22.270 --> 02:04:27.030
So what goes after a show night and you were already interested in that?

1933
02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:31.760
Yeah,
but I mean like,
uh,
so she,
uh,
I was also friends with like a couple other,

1934
02:04:31.761 --> 02:04:36.380
like it was a group of us who were friendly that we're comics and then I got,

1935
02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:38.030
I think that she didn't call me,
I think about

1936
02:04:38.030 --> 02:04:41.190
<v 14>another friend was like,
do you want to come out to this dinner?</v>

1937
02:04:41.191 --> 02:04:45.660
Like celebratory thing with Christina and her boyfriend?
And I was just like,

1938
02:04:45.661 --> 02:04:49.980
yeah,
sure.
I mean we went out and then we had this nice dinner.
Uh,

1939
02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:51.390
I think it was probably like 10,

1940
02:04:51.391 --> 02:04:56.130
12 people and then they were going to a strip club and I was like,
okay.

1941
02:04:56.250 --> 02:05:00.980
And then in the Strip club she comes up to me and is like,
Hey,
uh,

1942
02:05:02.070 --> 02:05:06.330
I want to get a stripper for my boyfriend.
And everybody said to ask you that,

1943
02:05:06.331 --> 02:05:08.970
you'd be like,
what stripper?

1944
02:05:08.971 --> 02:05:12.820
To get the dirt bag.
Sorry.

1945
02:05:14.460 --> 02:05:17.490
That's not true.
You're not,
you're not a strip club.

1946
02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:22.470
This guy,
this ex boyfriend mine,
I was actually on the outs with him,

1947
02:05:22.770 --> 02:05:26.850
which is why I would never get me.
Did you approach,
let me ask,

1948
02:05:26.851 --> 02:05:29.730
were you approaching Tom in a flirtatious way of like,

1949
02:05:29.790 --> 02:05:33.750
I'm kind of into this guy or were you genuine like I want help getting a

1950
02:05:33.860 --> 02:05:35.790
stripper boyfriend.
Here's the deal.

1951
02:05:35.791 --> 02:05:39.150
I was too too into getting rid of the current boyfriend.

1952
02:05:39.151 --> 02:05:43.620
Like he and I were on the outs and I was,
I wasn't looking at Dude's yet.

1953
02:05:43.850 --> 02:05:48.300
I was more of like unconsciously wanting to push him off of me.

1954
02:05:48.630 --> 02:05:53.590
And so I wanted them to get a lap dance in a weird way I think to get rid of,

1955
02:05:53.591 --> 02:05:56.740
like to get him interested in someone else,
if that makes sense.
It does.

1956
02:05:56.910 --> 02:05:59.640
And so I was talking to other male comics and I'm friends with like,

1957
02:05:59.641 --> 02:06:04.530
it was full charge in sickler and a,
I forget Andrew [inaudible] or something.

1958
02:06:04.860 --> 02:06:05.820
And I was like,
dude,

1959
02:06:05.821 --> 02:06:09.480
which like who's the guy that picks out the strippers and they all point to Tom

1960
02:06:10.410 --> 02:06:13.160
and I was like,
really fucking dirt bag.

1961
02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:17.020
And then you picked out the girl.
I thought it was funny.
I think it was,

1962
02:06:17.310 --> 02:06:20.010
I thought it was fun.
And did you pick a good one?
I don't remember.

1963
02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:24.330
I think I probably,
you know,
somebody like knowing myself,

1964
02:06:24.331 --> 02:06:27.300
I could not remembering it.
I probably would have ran with the ball.

1965
02:06:27.330 --> 02:06:31.290
I've been like,
oh yeah,
I'll tell you who to get sculpture.
You did.

1966
02:06:31.291 --> 02:06:35.340
You totally were like,
yeah,
but I liked you.

1967
02:06:35.341 --> 02:06:38.070
I always liked you as a comedian.
I thought you were very talented.

1968
02:06:38.071 --> 02:06:39.960
Like Tom never sucked at stand up.

1969
02:06:39.961 --> 02:06:44.100
He's a freakish people who like from the first time he did,
it was just amazing.

1970
02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:45.830
We were all open.
Miker is,

1971
02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:49.050
and I ran the show and I would have him close out every show.

1972
02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:52.080
I just saw almost every trial,
the closer.
He was so funny.

1973
02:06:52.170 --> 02:06:56.960
Even back in your relationships to use the closer he was the one that came and

1974
02:06:57.590 --> 02:07:02.010
set up,
right?
Yeah,
it's true.
Actually.
It's got,
I got in there,

1975
02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:07.500
I made it a deal.
He did get in here.
She was so young.

1976
02:07:07.501 --> 02:07:09.540
She was like such are so punk rock.

1977
02:07:09.870 --> 02:07:14.170
She's like wearing fishnets and knee high boots.
Smoke his cigarettes.

1978
02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:20.110
Jesus.
So angry just before therapy.
I'm like,

1979
02:07:22.020 --> 02:07:22.853
where you from?

1980
02:07:30.380 --> 02:07:34.260
I'm from La.
Everwell sucks.
True.
Okay.
Shit.

1981
02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:40.990
Oh,
I'm so pro la Mike,
except for Israel.
I love Israel.

1982
02:07:41.770 --> 02:07:42.603
Have you been there?

1983
02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:47.350
Now I want you to know as far as the u s I love,

1984
02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:52.270
it's my home.
I just don't like leaving my area.
I don't like it.

1985
02:07:52.420 --> 02:07:57.160
It's comfortable.
It's comfortable.
You learn as you get older.

1986
02:07:57.820 --> 02:08:02.560
Everyone's like this idea in their mind like the trip of a lifetime and I needed

1987
02:08:02.561 --> 02:08:05.440
venture.
There's nothing,
there's nothing good out there.

1988
02:08:07.330 --> 02:08:11.590
You know what I mean?
There's nothing out there.
No,
it doesn't.
No,
it's not good.

1989
02:08:11.620 --> 02:08:15.550
What's out there?
The same shit,
except you don't.
Different foods and flavors.

1990
02:08:15.940 --> 02:08:20.620
Do you not like traveling?
Okay.
Yeah.
It is overrated.

1991
02:08:20.621 --> 02:08:23.440
I swear to God,
traveling is severely overrated.

1992
02:08:23.500 --> 02:08:28.060
I think you would really quick going to get my dad on the phone with you.
My Dad.

1993
02:08:28.210 --> 02:08:32.590
I was like,
my dad's retiring December.
I was like,
God bless him.
I'm like,

1994
02:08:32.591 --> 02:08:35.730
very happy for him.
I go,
uh,
are you,
you know,
do you want to travel?
He's like,

1995
02:08:35.770 --> 02:08:38.500
I want to travel,
and I go,
you know,
somewhere like,

1996
02:08:38.590 --> 02:08:43.280
let's say you haven't really been to and enjoy like Italy.
He's like,
Italy,

1997
02:08:44.850 --> 02:08:47.920
what do I want to do that before I go?
I go,
I dunno.

1998
02:08:47.921 --> 02:08:52.000
You know museums are,
he's like,
Oh shit,
I hate that shit.

1999
02:08:53.710 --> 02:08:58.690
And he's like,
I mean,
if once you see a painting,
you saw it.
He's like,

2000
02:08:58.691 --> 02:09:03.510
who actually,
you have to pretend to enjoy museums buddy,

2001
02:09:03.550 --> 02:09:08.520
who's a honest person and museums.
It's fucking stupid.
And you only go,

2002
02:09:08.890 --> 02:09:11.520
you only go because you think you're supposed to like it.

2003
02:09:11.740 --> 02:09:14.770
There is a degree of it.
I think there's moments of enjoying the museum.

2004
02:09:15.370 --> 02:09:18.250
That's true.
By very rare.
No,

2005
02:09:18.340 --> 02:09:22.240
I'm saying so notes the moment I enjoy when I get a fucking like lunch and I sit

2006
02:09:22.241 --> 02:09:24.780
down.
That's true.
That's true.
It does.

2007
02:09:26.110 --> 02:09:29.500
I think a part of it is you're telling yourself you're more sophisticated than

2008
02:09:29.670 --> 02:09:33.250
true.
Right?
And that you're like,
oh yeah,
this is,
this is where this was done.

2009
02:09:33.310 --> 02:09:36.040
And you learned something about it.
So in that moment you go,

2010
02:09:36.070 --> 02:09:40.690
I actually know now you're Monet did this.
I feel like I remember that.

2011
02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:44.110
I used to take it.
I,
uh,
when I studied abroad,

2012
02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:49.320
we had to go to a museum once a week with the whole class every week.

2013
02:09:51.490 --> 02:09:53.310
Yeah.
Because you're actually,
you're getting a,

2014
02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:57.460
a dosage and injection of that feeling because that you're actually walking

2015
02:09:57.461 --> 02:10:01.930
through the museum with an art professor who is so,
you know,

2016
02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:05.260
so informed that it's like getting a super tour,
you know,

2017
02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:07.710
and then you leave there being like,
I'm a museum guy.
Yeah.

2018
02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:10.910
But then you go back by yourself,
you're like,
I gotta get the Fuck Outta Ya.
Yeah.

2019
02:10:10.990 --> 02:10:12.010
So it's,
it's,

2020
02:10:12.011 --> 02:10:15.790
there's a little bit of like self manipulation I think to make you feel smart.

2021
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:19.750
Go ahead.
Yeah,
I dunno.
I mean,
as a kid when you go to like,

2022
02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:23.650
we know as a kid we'd go to like Chicago Museum,
Natural History Museum,

2023
02:10:23.890 --> 02:10:28.090
those kinds of things are cool kid dinosaurs and shit.
That shit's cool.

2024
02:10:28.210 --> 02:10:30.940
I feel like it's just paper want to do something with themselves.

2025
02:10:31.250 --> 02:10:35.810
Like when you go to I'm,
and we,
we went through the Montreal and we were like,

2026
02:10:35.811 --> 02:10:39.560
okay,
what can we do here?
And then there's like,
oh,
there's a museum.

2027
02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:44.420
You know what?
I don't know.
Top rated attraction.
The whole fucking city.

2028
02:10:44.570 --> 02:10:48.590
Only adults do.
I other than eat.
Yeah.
The problem,

2029
02:10:48.591 --> 02:10:53.390
the problem with us human beings is that you go that we don't have anything to

2030
02:10:53.391 --> 02:10:56.660
fucking do.
This actually brings up the anniversary.

2031
02:10:56.750 --> 02:11:00.630
Our anniversary is coming up 10 years.
Wow.
And um,

2032
02:11:01.140 --> 02:11:04.040
and I was like,
I to take the trip of a lifetime,

2033
02:11:04.300 --> 02:11:05.900
we were talking about what to do and I was like,

2034
02:11:05.930 --> 02:11:10.320
let's go to an awesome restaurant.
She's like,
that's all we do.
I know.

2035
02:11:10.610 --> 02:11:15.320
More expensive.
What else?
And so I dunno.
She was like,

2036
02:11:15.410 --> 02:11:18.710
uh,
think of something more exciting.
I'm like,
God,
ideas stuff.
No,

2037
02:11:18.740 --> 02:11:21.920
we can't think of,
I really,
I personally really want to,

2038
02:11:21.921 --> 02:11:23.030
I have never been to Hawaii.

2039
02:11:23.031 --> 02:11:26.800
I want to go steal liquor and you have to do see that kind of travel.
I like,

2040
02:11:26.801 --> 02:11:31.520
I like beaches.
I like relaxing places,
good tastes good smells.

2041
02:11:32.090 --> 02:11:35.840
We can't do that with the babies.
You know,
what can you do?

2042
02:11:35.870 --> 02:11:40.100
I had that problem like every fucking weekend.
What are you going to do,

2043
02:11:40.180 --> 02:11:43.790
do you eat?
That's,

2044
02:11:44.090 --> 02:11:46.610
it doesn't really like eating.

2045
02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:51.320
I have to tell him what's an Ila like what's a fun adult thing?

2046
02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:52.611
Like if I'm like,

2047
02:11:52.611 --> 02:11:57.611
let's do something really fun this weekend and that's the Dan and I have a

2048
02:11:57.861 --> 02:12:01.490
single answer for you,
dog park,
you guys have a dog.

2049
02:12:01.820 --> 02:12:05.040
I don't really do that.
So the,

2050
02:12:05.380 --> 02:12:10.380
he's not all energetic and like driving me crazy movies when the movie is good,

2051
02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:16.130
but I'm tough.
Tough.
Yeah.
You know it's funny when you're saying this,

2052
02:12:16.131 --> 02:12:19.400
this is the exact moment.
I was like,
Oh,
I'm ready to have kids.
Cause I was like,

2053
02:12:19.401 --> 02:12:22.970
what the fuck am I doing with my life?
How many branches can I have?

2054
02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:26.030
How many fucking dinner?
And then you're like,
oh yeah,
my life.

2055
02:12:26.180 --> 02:12:30.290
Maybe that's what I'm saying.
Shit.
Or just like,
like when people,

2056
02:12:30.291 --> 02:12:32.300
like we have two children and they're young,

2057
02:12:32.301 --> 02:12:35.900
so we're pretty much housebound and sometimes you feel trapped and you're like,

2058
02:12:35.901 --> 02:12:38.630
I want to just go somewhere.
But you're like,
where am I going to go?

2059
02:12:38.631 --> 02:12:42.790
We never did anything before we had kids.
Now we're just home doing our kids.

2060
02:12:42.791 --> 02:12:44.570
You realize what?
Let's go to the Getty.

2061
02:12:46.330 --> 02:12:50.560
You realize that all you did was chill heart.

2062
02:12:52.590 --> 02:12:54.290
So just lay around.

2063
02:12:57.760 --> 02:13:00.950
Um,
you know what else I don't want to do.
And I think if I say it out loud,

2064
02:13:00.951 --> 02:13:03.020
I'm going to get like a torrent of fucking hate mail.

2065
02:13:03.670 --> 02:13:07.340
Like I have zero desire to see Hamilton.
I saw it.

2066
02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:11.620
It's wrapped,
but I only did it,
did it,

2067
02:13:12.740 --> 02:13:13.573
did you see it?

2068
02:13:13.900 --> 02:13:18.350
But I heard it was rap and I was like that fucking [inaudible] to me the other

2069
02:13:18.351 --> 02:13:22.400
day.
It was a realization.
She goes,
did you know him?
I was like,

2070
02:13:22.401 --> 02:13:24.470
of course buddy.

2071
02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:30.890
And the guy who plays Hamilton's like Puerto Rican just sounds terrible.

2072
02:13:30.891 --> 02:13:33.990
He Puerto Rico after Ethan's side when his mom,

2073
02:13:33.991 --> 02:13:38.250
which was a nice to hate to occur to see mom loves it.
Okay.

2074
02:13:38.251 --> 02:13:43.230
Ethan loved the music and he kept playing the soundtrack and I hate it.

2075
02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:47.660
You hate it.
She hates the soundtrack.
I love it.
You listen to Hamilton.

2076
02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:53.000
I love that.
She hates it.
Hate everyone hates me.
It's funny,
I've never heard it.

2077
02:13:54.170 --> 02:13:57.630
Is it like,
I've never heard a single term,
by the way,
I'm not insane.

2078
02:13:57.720 --> 02:14:02.150
If you go to the top charts,
the soundtrack of this play is like charging.

2079
02:14:02.370 --> 02:14:05.330
People are listening to first.
No,
I'm not insane.

2080
02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:08.460
But it's like catchy and it would get stuck in my head even though I hated it.

2081
02:14:08.490 --> 02:14:12.150
Like what's the Jam West Hamilton jam sing me like the jam.

2082
02:14:12.270 --> 02:14:13.110
What's the best thing?

2083
02:14:14.430 --> 02:14:18.690
What was one of the there there's this bit you guys want to throw up a bit.

2084
02:14:19.470 --> 02:14:23.390
Sure.
I don't know if we can do that.
No,
we can't throw it out there.

2085
02:14:24.730 --> 02:14:27.100
I'll show you a bit.
But um,

2086
02:14:27.210 --> 02:14:31.200
King George is this really hilarious character cause everyone's all like scrappy

2087
02:14:31.201 --> 02:14:31.681
hip hop,

2088
02:14:31.681 --> 02:14:36.210
like trying to build a nation and King George has like these really hilarious

2089
02:14:36.211 --> 02:14:40.140
bits where he so out of touch and he's singing like classically,
it's great.

2090
02:14:40.980 --> 02:14:43.680
You're gonna love rap is the one I should stop rap.

2091
02:14:44.340 --> 02:14:48.960
How does the sound that one's not Razzaq I'm building a country.
Is it?
Yeah.

2092
02:14:49.370 --> 02:14:53.970
How's it count?
I don't know.
I'm not here to defend.
I,
it's been a while.

2093
02:14:53.971 --> 02:14:55.450
So now I'm trying to remember how it goes.

2094
02:14:56.040 --> 02:15:00.810
I don't think constantly get sing a song.
I'm not,
but at any rate,

2095
02:15:01.240 --> 02:15:06.000
I
kind of,

2096
02:15:06.480 --> 02:15:10.290
that is the truth.
But,
um,
I,

2097
02:15:10.350 --> 02:15:13.650
my mom is into theater,
so I took her,
I had a lot of fun.

2098
02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:16.080
That kind of brings about one thing I wanted to ask you before.
I know it's,

2099
02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:19.710
you know,
we've been running for a while here,
but your mom,

2100
02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:20.820
would you ever date your mom

2101
02:15:24.550 --> 02:15:26.640
happens,
Tom,

2102
02:15:26.700 --> 02:15:30.590
your mom and you're my son and I fall in love with him.

2103
02:15:34.490 --> 02:15:37.980
I was scared to let you know too.
I am too,
both of stony adults.

2104
02:15:38.030 --> 02:15:42.490
If it comes down to it,
you know,
it's just like the gays there.

2105
02:15:44.490 --> 02:15:48.190
As long as they're all routine,
everything's fine.
So she going through jail,
uh,

2106
02:15:48.191 --> 02:15:52.090
they got arrested.
Is it illegal incest?
I think so.

2107
02:15:53.290 --> 02:15:56.360
Your mom is illegal.
Fucking your mom.
I don't think.
Wait.

2108
02:15:56.370 --> 02:15:57.440
Why did they go to prison for?

2109
02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:00.240
I think that because they put it out there instead of,
like I said,

2110
02:16:00.241 --> 02:16:02.940
it's just fucking,
you're fucking your mom and keeping your mouth shut.

2111
02:16:02.970 --> 02:16:06.860
And they had to do news fucking pieces about it.
Just fuck your mom and peace.

2112
02:16:06.861 --> 02:16:09.960
Just stop telling everyone that you're fucking your mom and you're fine.

2113
02:16:10.020 --> 02:16:14.430
I thought you were looking for an answer.
I was like,
what does anyone,
well,

2114
02:16:14.431 --> 02:16:18.090
it's important to know.
I'm curious.
Just like the gays.

2115
02:16:19.740 --> 02:16:22.910
Why have I never seen this before?
This is one of our favorites.
This is,

2116
02:16:23.260 --> 02:16:25.590
how do you find this stuff?
This stuff gets sent to us every week.

2117
02:16:27.870 --> 02:16:30.130
Mother fucker.
This is to,

2118
02:16:30.700 --> 02:16:35.260
we have a email that goes to their mom's podcast@gmail.com yeah,

2119
02:16:35.650 --> 02:16:39.280
our friends.
What's up?
I mean we don't get this stuff.
This is amazing.

2120
02:16:40.300 --> 02:16:44.950
This is a classic clip though.
This is not this week.
Yeah.
Just like the gays.

2121
02:16:45.350 --> 02:16:49.150
Will you ever date your mom ain't going where you get your son on magic being

2122
02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:53.080
somebody's mom and saying that 19 years you're the best thing that ever happened

2123
02:16:53.081 --> 02:16:57.770
to me and I really want to be with the rest of 19 yeah.

2124
02:16:57.880 --> 02:16:59.950
I really want to be with you for the rest of my life.

2125
02:16:59.980 --> 02:17:04.720
It's your son fucking loony tunes.
What is your problem?
Why do you hate love?

2126
02:17:05.470 --> 02:17:08.470
But you know,
in a,
in another sense,
do,

2127
02:17:08.590 --> 02:17:13.590
I don't know if they need to go to prison for fucking kids,

2128
02:17:14.441 --> 02:17:15.800
fucking kids.
He's

2129
02:17:17.530 --> 02:17:20.770
no better than sending it all to the same thing.

2130
02:17:20.830 --> 02:17:22.740
I'm with them.

2131
02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:26.950
They gave the follow the gaze can fuck,

2132
02:17:27.010 --> 02:17:31.540
then I can put my dick in any God damn thing.
Right.
That's the lie.
Including,

2133
02:17:31.541 --> 02:17:35.320
and especially my first approach was actually me.
Um,

2134
02:17:35.530 --> 02:17:36.670
what happened was we were,

2135
02:17:36.700 --> 02:17:39.390
we were hanging out match and hanging out and you know,

2136
02:17:39.410 --> 02:17:43.450
just talking and I was just laughing and I looked at her and she looked at me

2137
02:17:43.451 --> 02:17:47.620
and I just,
I kissed her.
Here's a real quick,
I want to die.

2138
02:17:52.380 --> 02:17:56.390
This is a worse than anything.
You guys watched this clip a lot.

2139
02:17:59.770 --> 02:18:02.500
You guys are trying to learn from you guys.

2140
02:18:02.710 --> 02:18:06.310
I just read you guys almost 500 episodes.
You do one episode a week.

2141
02:18:06.311 --> 02:18:11.230
That's incredible.
That's rose.
And I'm trying to learn from you guys.
Oh please.

2142
02:18:11.260 --> 02:18:15.760
We're a mess.
We're terrible.
So what really happened?

2143
02:18:15.761 --> 02:18:20.550
Those two are separated.
So she didn't raise him.
So they did.
Currently,

2144
02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:21.500
it's kind of common.

2145
02:18:22.250 --> 02:18:27.050
Dr Drew said that it's fallen in love with the story.

2146
02:18:28.250 --> 02:18:29.530
Why have we got to lock him up?

2147
02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:32.680
I mean that's not certainly going to help this kid psych you out.
Is it?

2148
02:18:34.330 --> 02:18:37.540
They're both in prison apparently according to both of them.
Oh,

2149
02:18:37.810 --> 02:18:39.750
I should ask them if they think it's wrong.

2150
02:18:41.920 --> 02:18:45.420
He's propelled by his own shit.
Get.
Yup.

2151
02:18:46.540 --> 02:18:50.380
I said that.
We have a lot of fan art work.
We have some that hang.

2152
02:18:50.390 --> 02:18:54.630
You guys have great woody Allen case.
Right?

2153
02:18:54.640 --> 02:18:59.470
Sooni was his stepdaughter and except she did grow up with him.
Right.

2154
02:19:00.360 --> 02:19:03.100
Well Craig,
that whole story is fascinating to me.

2155
02:19:03.101 --> 02:19:07.000
The most fascinating thing about woody Allen fucking his stepdaughter and

2156
02:19:07.001 --> 02:19:09.520
marrying her is that they have stayed together.

2157
02:19:10.660 --> 02:19:12.460
It wasn't like he's around fucking kids.

2158
02:19:12.461 --> 02:19:17.230
Like they're still married going on 22 years.
Yeah,
dude,
that's dude.

2159
02:19:17.231 --> 02:19:20.880
That is the most impressive.
So there's something I don't know about something.

2160
02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:23.410
He knows how to lay the wood if we're being honest,

2161
02:19:23.411 --> 02:19:24.790
but it looks right in the fucking name.

2162
02:19:26.900 --> 02:19:31.520
One time I asked my Stepdad and I went to kiss like or over Christmas I was like

2163
02:19:31.521 --> 02:19:36.521
19 and like he turned his head as I went to kiss him and I accidentally like

2164
02:19:36.831 --> 02:19:38.990
kissed him on the mouth,
you know?
And you're like,

2165
02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:42.070
oh well it's so fucked up unless you map.

2166
02:19:42.071 --> 02:19:46.700
Do you mouth kiss your parents normally?
No,
I know we will ship you.

2167
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:50.690
The first time I saw that I have a neighbor across the street.
It's so upsetting.

2168
02:19:51.500 --> 02:19:53.360
And they said bye.
I love you.
First of all,

2169
02:19:53.390 --> 02:19:54.980
I don't even say I love you to my parents.

2170
02:19:54.981 --> 02:19:58.370
Like when we go like they say like there's families just say I love you whenever

2171
02:19:58.371 --> 02:19:59.870
they leave the house and that's fine.
It's sweet.

2172
02:19:59.930 --> 02:20:03.650
I just found a bizarre because yeah we don't talk to each other like that much

2173
02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:07.280
like that.
But then they kissed on the lips and I wasn't just like,
I was like,

2174
02:20:08.110 --> 02:20:12.600
yeah,
I've seen that too.
It's odd.
It's very weird.
Weird.
I don't know why.

2175
02:20:12.800 --> 02:20:16.070
I think I used to be like the instinct to with like,
cause we have babies.

2176
02:20:16.460 --> 02:20:20.420
You see these puffy little cheeks like you kiss cheeks or the kissing on the

2177
02:20:20.421 --> 02:20:23.960
mouth just seems,
it seems like out of the way.

2178
02:20:24.380 --> 02:20:27.380
Abnormal to romantic.
It's romantic.
It is.

2179
02:20:27.950 --> 02:20:31.980
Let's get some laughs going so off.
I hate this one too.

2180
02:20:36.740 --> 02:20:40.250
<v 4>Oh
wait,
what happened in front of a baby?</v>

2181
02:20:41.910 --> 02:20:46.290
Oh my God.
Why did it look like he got shot?
Is the car,

2182
02:20:46.480 --> 02:20:50.790
it's a car loaded.
No,
that was just his legs.

2183
02:20:51.850 --> 02:20:55.170
I got to see the impact again.
I'm just confused.
Yeah,
does that,

2184
02:20:55.640 --> 02:20:57.150
I thought it shot combustion.

2185
02:21:01.080 --> 02:21:03.900
Look what's happening here though.
I know.
Are you seeing this?

2186
02:21:05.880 --> 02:21:09.790
Wasn't there an explosion?
No.
No.
I think my crazy,

2187
02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:14.170
he dropped his clipboard.
There was too

2188
02:21:17.010 --> 02:21:21.220
bad drive
stock.

2189
02:21:24.570 --> 02:21:28.710
That's what he's saying.
Look who's laughing hysterically.

2190
02:21:28.711 --> 02:21:32.220
She's got a great sense,
is happy.
She's been this old episode,

2191
02:21:33.780 --> 02:21:35.850
my husband and he got mental problems like Tom.

2192
02:21:35.960 --> 02:21:38.240
So you how concerned he is over here and this guy that's a girl.

2193
02:21:40.590 --> 02:21:44.200
That's the funniest part is that guy.
He's just like,
God damn it,
man.

2194
02:21:44.310 --> 02:21:46.620
We're going to be late for lunch.
Yeah,
that's what his thought was.

2195
02:21:46.650 --> 02:21:48.930
We're going to miss mine.
Yeah.
That guy's going to have a race horse.

2196
02:21:51.220 --> 02:21:55.680
<v 14>This book,
I swear.
Is the scream funny to you?
Yeah.
Yep.
See,
I told you,</v>

2197
02:21:55.740 --> 02:21:59.490
I told you I'm sorry to do this to the listeners and everyone.
Can we,

2198
02:21:59.491 --> 02:22:03.110
is there a slow motion setting?
Um,
I can do.

2199
02:22:03.140 --> 02:22:06.120
You can see that's what it is.
Yeah.

2200
02:22:06.690 --> 02:22:08.290
It's that it,

2201
02:22:09.340 --> 02:22:11.580
<v 4>no,
no,</v>

2202
02:22:12.800 --> 02:22:17.060
<v 14>no.
I don't notice anything with compassion.
Doesn't laugh upon the impact.</v>

2203
02:22:17.710 --> 02:22:22.340
The sociopath.
Like Tom is laughing hysterically.
I,
we'll both take the test.
Okay.

2204
02:22:22.341 --> 02:22:26.180
I'll send you that.
We're all taking it.
We're going to to learn.
Yeah.

2205
02:22:26.190 --> 02:22:30.010
Though this is another class because all time favorite clip is a cause.

2206
02:22:30.210 --> 02:22:32.970
I mean it's fun.
Raj,

No shirt,

That wants to get fucked up bad.
Yeah.

2229
02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:13.570
I'm really very observant.
You guys are really observing the similar,

2230
02:24:13.571 --> 02:24:16.810
it took us a long time to dissect this video.
There's a lot of meth.

2231
02:24:16.811 --> 02:24:20.580
We had doctor drew even watch it.
Oh,
oh no.

2232
02:24:20.590 --> 02:24:23.020
The math or the stream.
I feel like that,

2233
02:24:23.890 --> 02:24:28.170
that desire to get fucked.
So that's a meth thing,

I don't know,
but he definitely wants it.

2235
02:24:33.580 --> 02:24:36.040
I don't think I've ever wanted anything that bad.
I've never,

2236
02:24:36.130 --> 02:24:38.960
I don't know that I've ever been that horny.

Getting late in the day.
That was great.

How long has it been?

2250
02:25:38.261 --> 02:25:41.540
It's three 40 made me throw my phone.
So I don't know.
Three,

2251
02:25:41.590 --> 02:25:44.680
four weeks would mean the whole episodes already over two and a half hours.

2252
02:25:45.190 --> 02:25:48.370
You guys have been here more than an hour and a half.
Okay.

2253
02:25:48.371 --> 02:25:50.780
You guys recorded or it doesn't feel long?
Yeah.

2254
02:25:50.860 --> 02:25:54.200
You do like half an hour right before.
Oh yeah,
we did a little bit longer.

2255
02:25:54.201 --> 02:25:57.280
What'd you guys talk about?
We just took clips mostly.
You know,

2256
02:25:57.281 --> 02:25:59.290
this weekend was sort of uneventful.

2257
02:25:59.291 --> 02:26:01.990
Like I took a massive shit this morning really early.

2258
02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:06.340
Like you didn't even talk about that response lane.
Oh my God,
we're on a,
I'm,

2259
02:26:06.360 --> 02:26:08.980
I'm on this Paleo Diet to lose baby weight.

2260
02:26:09.460 --> 02:26:13.960
And the browns have just been on believable quality.
Really good.

2261
02:26:14.270 --> 02:26:17.980
Easy wipes.
Yeah.
Easy wives.
Pretty,
pretty astounding.

2262
02:26:18.130 --> 02:26:22.410
I have like three a day that are just healthy.
And what are you doing?
Same thing.

2263
02:26:22.500 --> 02:26:27.270
Oh,
fucking so bread is actually what's causing all the issues?
No,
no sugar.
Yeah.

2264
02:26:27.370 --> 02:26:30.760
What is it?
Oh No,
I dunno.
I mean,
look,

2265
02:26:30.830 --> 02:26:35.410
I don't need a virgin fiber in this diet.
That's what it is.
Yeah.
You know,
uh,

2266
02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:39.790
Chris Delea put me on this,
uh,
metamucil.
Yeah,
that shit.

2267
02:26:39.820 --> 02:26:42.660
That's awesome.
Chris Takes Nice Shit,
Huh?
Hmm.

2268
02:26:42.870 --> 02:26:45.690
<v 15>Apparently if you ask him,
that's what he'll tell you.</v>

2269
02:26:45.830 --> 02:26:49.070
<v 14>Apparently he said that the wife doesn't even matter to him because there was,</v>

2270
02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:52.470
it's like a one wipe and he's ended it.

2271
02:26:52.840 --> 02:26:55.900
<v 15>Did you do it bro?
I,
I take that shit like can't,
it's kind of crazy.</v>

2272
02:26:55.901 --> 02:26:59.130
You get this big bottle and they're like huge pills and you're like,
oh,

2273
02:26:59.140 --> 02:27:00.250
just take a couple of every minute.

2274
02:27:00.251 --> 02:27:04.170
You're supposed to take like eight a day no matter got.

2275
02:27:04.490 --> 02:27:08.620
But like I started taking,
oh so happened in my,
I think maybe like,
Oh really?

2276
02:27:08.710 --> 02:27:12.400
Oh I'm good.
No,
I'm good.
And I started taking like two with every meal.

2277
02:27:13.630 --> 02:27:17.680
Oh my God.
Dude.
It's crazy.
Cause I usually have like really,
you know,

2278
02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:22.780
noxious shits like really toxic.
I mean not just smelling it like I'm talking.

2279
02:27:22.781 --> 02:27:26.320
Like sometimes you'll get shit on the side of the bowl.

2280
02:27:27.340 --> 02:27:31.280
<v 14>You're one of those guys.
Sometimes that's how your dad is.</v>

2281
02:27:31.281 --> 02:27:32.114
I always wonder how that has,

2282
02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:34.230
<v 15>it's not every day,
it's a special occasion,</v>

2283
02:27:34.231 --> 02:27:38.790
but sometimes you are wiping like your thigh.
Wow.

2284
02:27:38.820 --> 02:27:40.410
Let me put it that way.
Not every time,

2285
02:27:40.411 --> 02:27:43.800
but sometimes you're wiping your thigh and you're like really sick.

2286
02:27:43.860 --> 02:27:44.880
That's a Crohn's disease.

2287
02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:45.993
<v 21>Oh yeah.</v>

2288
02:27:48.890 --> 02:27:51.680
<v 14>Uh,
but um,
I don't know.</v>

2289
02:27:51.990 --> 02:27:56.200
That's the lady from afar video and I love that.
Um,

2290
02:27:56.210 --> 02:27:59.270
when they pretend to be shy,
so they do is they fought and they're like,

2291
02:27:59.330 --> 02:28:03.420
oh my God,
did I do that?
It's like the,

2292
02:28:06.270 --> 02:28:09.180
<v 21>Oh
wow.</v>

2293
02:28:13.420 --> 02:28:16.130
<v 14>And did I do that?
Oops.</v>

2294
02:28:16.900 --> 02:28:21.280
Was the gnarliest part I've ever heard in my life.
And you guys heard of,
uh,

2295
02:28:21.530 --> 02:28:24.090
a guy named king ass ripper?
Nope.

2296
02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:29.600
Like you guys are tuned into what's,

2297
02:28:29.601 --> 02:28:34.100
why are we not seeing these videos?
I mean private that,
you know,

2298
02:28:34.160 --> 02:28:36.480
higher caliber of entertainment,
the hole.

2299
02:28:37.430 --> 02:28:40.180
But you guys are in the youtube community.
I feel like,
cause I,

2300
02:28:40.190 --> 02:28:42.740
I've listened to your podcast and you'll be like,

2301
02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:47.000
there's like rivalries and stuff between people I've never heard of.
You're like,

2302
02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:51.740
this guy's whatever beef with that dude and that.
Yeah.
Awesome.
Yeah,

2303
02:28:51.741 --> 02:28:54.590
it's like a whole other universe.
It's that we don't even have it.

2304
02:28:54.620 --> 02:28:55.730
We don't know anything about it.

2305
02:28:55.760 --> 02:29:00.530
I really feel like 60 when I like to figure out some of that stuff,

2306
02:29:00.531 --> 02:29:02.840
I'm like,
oh,
these kids talking about,
yeah.

2307
02:29:03.260 --> 02:29:07.520
Well even when we had dinner the other night and you guys were explaining why

2308
02:29:07.521 --> 02:29:11.570
people want to watch other people play video games and you're like,
oh,

2309
02:29:11.571 --> 02:29:12.650
that might,
but you were like,
oh,

2310
02:29:12.980 --> 02:29:15.530
they're good at playing the games and you want to learn how they do it.

2311
02:29:15.530 --> 02:29:17.150
And I'm like,
oh,
that kind of makes sense now.

2312
02:29:17.180 --> 02:29:20.480
Well it's like watching a professional athletes.
Yeah.
It's not,

2313
02:29:20.510 --> 02:29:23.240
you want to learn to do it,
you're just,
you know how to play.

2314
02:29:23.241 --> 02:29:25.880
You're just will never be that good.
As amazing as they are.
Yeah.

2315
02:29:26.170 --> 02:29:31.170
I guess that's also a concept that's foreign to most people if they're not

2316
02:29:32.021 --> 02:29:34.300
playing all the time because they probably go like,
yeah,

2317
02:29:34.301 --> 02:29:37.790
they're not that like the thought is that person person's not that high

2318
02:29:39.620 --> 02:29:43.930
because they don't know.
You don't play a lot.
You don't go like,
that guy's great.

2319
02:29:43.931 --> 02:29:46.170
Right,
right.
Yeah.
When I first met Ethan,

2320
02:29:46.180 --> 02:29:49.660
I used to think like that too because it would put on this like starcraft,
Dota,

2321
02:29:49.661 --> 02:29:52.450
starcraft,
the nerdiest looking game.

2322
02:29:52.750 --> 02:29:54.820
You look at it and you're doing even understand what you're saying.

2323
02:29:55.360 --> 02:29:58.570
And they would watch people playing.
I didn't even know that existed.

2324
02:29:58.810 --> 02:30:03.810
So now it makes sense to me after spending time and getting to know it.

2325
02:30:05.950 --> 02:30:10.470
It,
I dunno,
I think it's just a first year.
Like what?
And that's because people,

2326
02:30:10.471 --> 02:30:15.430
it's way like the staple center,
right?
Yeah.
Like these big,
uh,

2327
02:30:15.790 --> 02:30:20.680
the big conventions and like the,
the competitions are now in arenas.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2328
02:30:21.060 --> 02:30:22.650
Great.
What are the on my views are crazy,

2329
02:30:22.651 --> 02:30:26.100
like millions of people are watching online to see a guy playing a game.

2330
02:30:26.310 --> 02:30:29.580
I guess you know it's,
it makes sense when you actually explain it.

2331
02:30:29.581 --> 02:30:34.410
It's just professional athletes.
It's the same,
same concept.

2332
02:30:41.570 --> 02:30:43.680
<v 4>Sounds like you're doing a heavy construction.</v>

2333
02:30:47.570 --> 02:30:48.770
<v 9>How do you hold that much gas?</v>

2334
02:30:50.690 --> 02:30:54.740
<v 14>This was when he gets caught with,
damn,
he's got a,
he's got a fat ass.
Fuck.</v>

2335
02:30:54.741 --> 02:30:58.280
That looks unnatural.
So you've got a whoopee cushion in there or some shit?
No,

2336
02:30:58.281 --> 02:31:02.800
he pulled them up or cause I don't see his ass crack.
Well yeah,
he's right.

2337
02:31:02.860 --> 02:31:04.600
I don't know.
That's true.
Where's his,
his sound?

2338
02:31:04.610 --> 02:31:08.410
It looks like he's wearing a diaper or something.
He wears.
She actually needs on,

2339
02:31:09.050 --> 02:31:09.740
we should have,

2340
02:31:09.740 --> 02:31:14.090
he gets playful sometimes and he'll do like a little leg lift or he'll do two

2341
02:31:14.091 --> 02:31:15.260
thumbs up as he does it.

2342
02:31:18.820 --> 02:31:19.710
<v 9>That's it sounds like</v>

2343
02:31:20.290 --> 02:31:21.540
<v 4>when we lived in New York,</v>

2344
02:31:21.560 --> 02:31:25.790
<v 14>got like 8:00 AM outside when they're starting to do work on the street.</v>

2345
02:31:27.890 --> 02:31:31.670
I love the tidy whities out a friend.
I think I can explain this phenomenon.

2346
02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:36.020
Never heard this.
I had a,
I have a friend,
he would,
uh,

2347
02:31:36.050 --> 02:31:37.340
he had a party trick.

2348
02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:42.170
He would lie on his stomach and he could suck air up his alley.
Oh,

2349
02:31:42.210 --> 02:31:46.850
you know about that?
Okay.
Oh yeah,
that's my video.
Oh,
that's my,
that's my video.

2350
02:31:46.851 --> 02:31:50.710
Warm it up right there.
That's you.
That's our first viral video.

2351
02:31:51.470 --> 02:31:52.510
That's your very first one.

2352
02:31:52.511 --> 02:31:57.020
So our first viral video and looking for more popular type of video,
like do you,

2353
02:31:57.021 --> 02:32:00.920
do you,
are you able to gauge what the audience wants?
You know what I'm saying?

2354
02:32:00.921 --> 02:32:05.870
Like what's the most popular thing that we make called reaction videos and it's,

2355
02:32:06.510 --> 02:32:10.790
but it's just me watching something or making fun of something or

2356
02:32:12.320 --> 02:32:16.910
like what kinds of murder?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
It's usually something stupid.

2357
02:32:16.940 --> 02:32:20.990
Something stupid.
Someone to make commentary is straight up comedy commentary.

2358
02:32:20.991 --> 02:32:25.190
Then look,
that's what you're doing.
You know,
it's a comedic take on things.

2359
02:32:26.590 --> 02:32:30.200
It can be on a television clip show for sure.

2360
02:32:31.310 --> 02:32:35.630
Yeah.
I find it difficult to be funny when I don't have,
I don't know.

2361
02:32:35.930 --> 02:32:40.340
I'm not good at like writing jokes.
So I feel like I need something to direct my,

2362
02:32:40.850 --> 02:32:44.280
yeah,
but then you ended up,
I don't want to end up convenience about that.
Yeah,

2363
02:32:44.420 --> 02:32:46.940
I dunno.
Yeah,
I dunno.
I don't like,

2364
02:32:49.580 --> 02:32:53.840
I don't,
I'm afraid of be doing like America's funniest home videos shit.
Oh yeah.

2365
02:32:53.841 --> 02:32:57.680
But you're not doing at all.
I'm never that guy by the way.

2366
02:32:57.681 --> 02:33:01.100
Who was farting?
So you saw his body for a moment.

2367
02:33:01.820 --> 02:33:06.350
He's also over the years been a gainer,
Uhm,
like gaining weight,

2368
02:33:06.590 --> 02:33:10.850
like intentionally fetishize and like he was pretty bloody fit.

2369
02:33:11.090 --> 02:33:14.270
This is where it looks like sky is

2370
02:33:15.450 --> 02:33:19.530
<v 4>chosen.
This guy's got a path in life.</v>

2371
02:33:24.640 --> 02:33:27.550
<v 22>I'm envious of him.
Look how much,
look how much weight he's gained.</v>

2372
02:33:29.680 --> 02:33:32.170
He was really,
he was really healthy.
He was.

2373
02:33:32.980 --> 02:33:35.320
So people are meant to watch this and get turned on.

2374
02:33:36.840 --> 02:33:40.810
He will come on or shown you've contacted us so many times.

2375
02:33:40.840 --> 02:33:44.410
One time he made a video and dedicated it to us and that was like his,

2376
02:33:44.470 --> 02:33:46.360
I think I see you.

2377
02:33:46.570 --> 02:33:49.990
Can I say something like that I really admire about him and people like him.

2378
02:33:50.580 --> 02:33:51.070
Your attorney turned

2379
02:33:51.070 --> 02:33:55.210
<v 14>on?
No,
I just,
I liked it.
They know what they like.
Yeah.</v>

2380
02:33:55.390 --> 02:33:59.510
I just dump money.
Really?
I'm like,
I dunno.
It was like,

2381
02:33:59.511 --> 02:34:01.990
I think it got up to like a thousand or something and he was just like,

2382
02:34:01.991 --> 02:34:06.790
he ain't in the area.
No,
I was saying like,
it wasn't like,

2383
02:34:06.791 --> 02:34:09.520
he was like,
that's not enough.
How about this?
He was just like,

2384
02:34:10.150 --> 02:34:15.060
I'm good because he,
he's,
because he does it for the love of the game is obese,

2385
02:34:15.190 --> 02:34:17.560
you know,
he's got rules,
right.

2386
02:34:22.310 --> 02:34:23.810
<v 23>He's really gained a ton of it.</v>

2387
02:34:24.040 --> 02:34:28.330
<v 14>I like how he looks around kind of cautiously spot in this shit.
Sometimes he'll,</v>

2388
02:34:28.390 --> 02:34:31.590
he'll just eat,
he'll smash like,
uh,

2389
02:34:31.750 --> 02:34:36.010
six egg mcmuffins and then a two liter and then he'll,

2390
02:34:37.300 --> 02:34:42.100
he'll get up and fart on food and then eat the farts on the food.
And Yeah,

2391
02:34:42.490 --> 02:34:46.040
man,
I wish I even found the videos you guys find.
I love your show.
I love that.

2392
02:34:46.630 --> 02:34:50.680
You know,
our shows are cut.
They're kind of similar.
Minus the youtube.

2393
02:34:51.640 --> 02:34:54.200
I think you're right.
Yes,
you're a sensibility in a way.

2394
02:34:54.201 --> 02:34:57.670
I know you guys have fucking real sleeper cells out of here.

2395
02:34:57.671 --> 02:35:01.470
Get him something good.
They do,
man.
They do.
They're amazing.

2396
02:35:01.480 --> 02:35:04.720
Remember his handle.
What was it?
Um,
was it archivally?
Yeah,

2397
02:35:04.900 --> 02:35:09.640
it was like I fart in Yo face.
I kept getting kicked off of services.
So funny.

2398
02:35:09.641 --> 02:35:13.090
So he was on youtube and lively back and forth and he was hairy and growth.

2399
02:35:13.390 --> 02:35:17.830
I fart in Yo face area and growth.
How many views does this have?
This,

2400
02:35:17.831 --> 02:35:22.390
can we read some of the comments?
Sure.
Burger King,
Gord,

2401
02:35:22.391 --> 02:35:25.960
let's do it.
16,000 let's see fives and he'll get the description.

2402
02:35:26.020 --> 02:35:30.570
Five what?
Imagine more farts.

2403
02:35:30.580 --> 02:35:34.420
Please.
I don't have a fetish.
I,
these are all your fans.

2404
02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:37.640
Probably geared.
King asked,

2405
02:35:37.790 --> 02:35:39.920
<v 15>where can I donate money to have you make a video for me?</v>

2406
02:35:39.950 --> 02:35:44.780
Also do said also if you accept,
can you do a shoutout?

2407
02:35:45.670 --> 02:35:50.500
<v 14>Imagine working at Burger King and seeing some fat slob walk in with his own jar</v>

2408
02:35:50.501 --> 02:35:55.440
of mayonnaise.
It's,
it's true.
You'd be like,
what the fuck guys?

2409
02:35:55.790 --> 02:36:00.370
Yeah.
Why are people so angry?
They are.

2410
02:36:01.330 --> 02:36:02.800
They always are.
I know,

2411
02:36:02.801 --> 02:36:06.430
especially on you guys put up with a different kind of look,

2412
02:36:06.431 --> 02:36:10.570
stamp comedians deal with hate and um,
people not liking what you do.

2413
02:36:10.571 --> 02:36:12.280
But I feel like in the youtube community,

2414
02:36:12.640 --> 02:36:17.620
man that hate just seems real fucking immediate and direct and like it is

2415
02:36:17.621 --> 02:36:22.530
intense,
right?
Yeah.
I guess the comments are just hard,

2416
02:36:22.540 --> 02:36:26.050
man.
I don't,
I try to stay away from you.
I'm reminded.
It's just,
yeah,

2417
02:36:26.250 --> 02:36:29.920
<v 15>like as a comedian or traditional media,
there's just,</v>

2418
02:36:30.010 --> 02:36:35.010
there's a layer between you and the people that doesn't exist at all on youtube.

2419
02:36:35.530 --> 02:36:38.460
Right.
It's just,
there's no separation.

2420
02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:43.600
It's the youtubers against the charter I think is the thing that doesn't exist

2421
02:36:44.400 --> 02:36:45.770
in the community and work.

2422
02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:50.030
<v 14>We don't do that like wrap feuds,
rapper feuds now dude.</v>

2423
02:36:50.210 --> 02:36:53.780
So you guys have like full on wrapper fuse with other youtubers?

2424
02:36:54.660 --> 02:36:55.700
<v 15>More like,
um,</v>

2425
02:36:57.660 --> 02:37:01.800
people will make videos knowing that it'll get a lot of views.

2426
02:37:02.160 --> 02:37:06.240
It's not like I know them or would respond to them or anything.
It's like,

2427
02:37:06.990 --> 02:37:10.200
like it's a feeding frenzy when something happens and then everyone's like

2428
02:37:10.830 --> 02:37:12.360
trolling now trolling.

2429
02:37:12.361 --> 02:37:15.560
They're just like making a video about it cause they know we'll get a lot views.

2430
02:37:15.730 --> 02:37:20.620
<v 0>Gotcha.
Hmm.
Yeah.
It's totally different.
Game different.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

2431
02:37:20.621 --> 02:37:22.860
It's wild.
It's wild.
Yeah.
Because that,

2432
02:37:23.140 --> 02:37:27.520
that whole thing of being able to quantify doesn't exist really in stand up.

2433
02:37:27.580 --> 02:37:31.800
You know,
you quantify like ticket sales,
take emails,
you know,

2434
02:37:31.810 --> 02:37:35.230
people kind of just go like that's great.
Wow,
that's a lot.

2435
02:37:35.950 --> 02:37:39.780
You know that person should sell more ticket.
Like it doesn't really become like,

2436
02:37:39.820 --> 02:37:43.130
it's not like a,
because you're,
you're,
we're not always like publicized.

2437
02:37:43.140 --> 02:37:44.800
Like you don't look somewhere and see tickets.

2438
02:37:44.910 --> 02:37:49.410
<v 15>The thing is like,
um,
and also you have this like youtube algorithm,</v>

2439
02:37:49.411 --> 02:37:52.250
so there's a bunch of people that are angry at us right now because we made it,

2440
02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:55.400
well,
whatever it does not,
it doesn't really matter what.

2441
02:37:55.430 --> 02:37:59.660
But so there's like this feeding frenzy of everyone making videos like talking

2442
02:37:59.661 --> 02:38:00.494
shit about us.

2443
02:38:00.650 --> 02:38:05.130
So then youtube algorithm is suggesting this video,
they're like,

2444
02:38:05.180 --> 02:38:08.600
you just saw this video of someone talking shit about us on the sidebar.

2445
02:38:08.930 --> 02:38:11.450
So it's like,
it creates this ecosystem.

2446
02:38:11.720 --> 02:38:16.040
Like we saw this one channel that has like no subscribers,

2447
02:38:16.190 --> 02:38:21.190
gets on average 300 views per video and they made a video being like a talking

2448
02:38:23.571 --> 02:38:28.040
shit about us,
whatever.
And it has like,
you know,
300,000 views,
cheese.

2449
02:38:28.070 --> 02:38:29.960
It's like they're building there,
but it's like this,

2450
02:38:29.990 --> 02:38:32.510
this ecosystem that the algorithm creates.
Yeah.

2451
02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:36.720
<v 14>To do that.
So it's like,
yeah,</v>

2452
02:38:37.030 --> 02:38:41.180
we're going to be like either just left here,
we got shit to say.

2453
02:38:41.181 --> 02:38:43.370
You would fucking go a lot of,
yes,

2454
02:38:45.390 --> 02:38:48.890
we're going to do a total exposed video.
But it's just,
it's like,
you know,

2455
02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:50.340
you live and die by that.

2456
02:38:51.510 --> 02:38:55.200
<v 0>It's funny that people would say that.
Uh,
like make shit talking videos.</v>

2457
02:38:55.230 --> 02:38:59.970
Especially because I think,
I think actually,
even though we got,
we don't like,
no,

2458
02:38:59.971 --> 02:39:00.601
you guys super.

2459
02:39:00.601 --> 02:39:05.370
Well we know you more away from that then from that.

2460
02:39:05.630 --> 02:39:08.370
So to us it'd be like,
why would you make a video about those tutors?

2461
02:39:09.430 --> 02:39:13.520
<v 14>Thanks.
You know what I mean?
Like it seems weird.
It is weird.
It's weird for me.</v>

2462
02:39:13.850 --> 02:39:14.730
Yeah,
it's weird.

2463
02:39:15.050 --> 02:39:18.230
<v 15>The part,
it's weird.
Yeah.
It's weird because they don't really know who we are,</v>

2464
02:39:18.231 --> 02:39:22.940
but they just,
you know,
uh,
it's just,
I don't know.

2465
02:39:23.060 --> 02:39:26.480
It's weird and that's why it's so difficult for me too because I feel like I

2466
02:39:26.481 --> 02:39:29.420
didn't do anything wrong.
But,
and part of it,

2467
02:39:29.421 --> 02:39:32.120
it's so painful sometimes are difficult,
is that you can't escape it.

2468
02:39:32.121 --> 02:39:34.820
Like I'll open youtube and my whole homepage,

2469
02:39:34.850 --> 02:39:39.230
like right now is just full of h three hate videos because youtube thinks that

2470
02:39:39.231 --> 02:39:42.530
because I watch three videos or anyone that watches a show,

2471
02:39:42.540 --> 02:39:43.690
it's like you want us to see.

2472
02:39:43.860 --> 02:39:47.270
So it's like they're pushing it to all of our fans and it's on my homepage

2473
02:39:47.271 --> 02:39:51.740
everywhere and that,
I don't know.
It's,
it's,
it's tough dude.
It is tough

2474
02:39:52.260 --> 02:39:53.093
<v 0>being,</v>

2475
02:39:53.410 --> 02:39:56.930
<v 14>yeah,
that is tough.
Especially because escapable it's like the way you're right,</v>

2476
02:39:57.030 --> 02:40:01.360
the way that it's designed is as opposed to heap on,
it's just what's popular.

2477
02:40:01.361 --> 02:40:05.260
Right?
Like it's a popularity contest in a way.
Even if it's negative popularity.

2478
02:40:05.350 --> 02:40:08.920
Yeah.
Whereas this standup,
like you release a special people might hate you.

2479
02:40:08.921 --> 02:40:11.740
They might tweet at you once and that's it.
Like,

2480
02:40:11.810 --> 02:40:15.660
it doesn't kind of pile on and it doesn't generally really,
you know,

2481
02:40:15.661 --> 02:40:16.530
it kind of goes away.

2482
02:40:16.590 --> 02:40:19.650
It goes away and people forget how shitty you are and then they move on to

2483
02:40:19.651 --> 02:40:20.960
something like this will go away

2484
02:40:21.060 --> 02:40:21.520
<v 15>eventually.</v>

2485
02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:26.430
It's just right now it's like youtube has this fucking insane algorithm that

2486
02:40:26.431 --> 02:40:29.130
knows that everyone sees that video was like,
what the fuck is this?

2487
02:40:29.131 --> 02:40:33.310
And clicks it.
Yeah.
So it's showing it to everybody,
but it's Kinda,
it's,

2488
02:40:33.390 --> 02:40:37.700
it's sweet in a way knowing that you can create a whole ecosystem of hate

2489
02:40:37.770 --> 02:40:41.910
<v 14>videos and plus you guys are so kind of like newer you,
right.</v>

2490
02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:43.410
You've been doing it for three years,
right

2491
02:40:43.650 --> 02:40:46.590
<v 15>Tony?
Well,
three years full time I guess.</v>

2492
02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:49.170
<v 14>Right.
I feel like Tom and I have been,</v>

2493
02:40:49.290 --> 02:40:54.290
I'm used to people hating us for like 15 years.

2494
02:40:54.900 --> 02:40:58.200
And the first of it begins when you start featuring and clubs and there's this

2495
02:40:58.201 --> 02:41:01.920
thing called comment cards cause the club wants to basically collect email

2496
02:41:01.921 --> 02:41:05.100
addresses so that they can solicit,
we make you read this shit,

2497
02:41:05.190 --> 02:41:08.310
they don't make you what's,
what happens is you'll as a feature act,
you're like,

2498
02:41:08.311 --> 02:41:11.010
yeah,
I wonder how people think about it.
I wonder if I did great.

2499
02:41:11.011 --> 02:41:13.810
And then you're like,
you know,
there's,

2500
02:41:14.250 --> 02:41:17.850
there's 10 good ones and then one horrible one and you're like,
fuck,

2501
02:41:17.851 --> 02:41:19.680
I just crush it.
Painful for sure.

2502
02:41:19.681 --> 02:41:24.240
But what happens is that dosage starts then and then you go like,

2503
02:41:24.300 --> 02:41:29.070
oh I need to up the antivenom a little bit.
Right.

2504
02:41:29.071 --> 02:41:33.180
So then,
yeah,
still hurts,
right,
like the next few times.
But you just get,
you,

2505
02:41:33.230 --> 02:41:36.020
you build up that immunity to it after awhile.

2506
02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:40.120
Cause I remember seeing a set that I did,
uh,
uh,

2507
02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:44.090
let us showcase at a festival was posted to something I had never had someone

2508
02:41:44.091 --> 02:41:47.490
with toasted.
And then like you had like some people were like,
oh funny,

2509
02:41:47.491 --> 02:41:50.670
you're like,
and then you see like the first like don't quit your day job duties.

2510
02:41:51.140 --> 02:41:53.280
Garbage.
God Damn.
Yeah.

2511
02:41:53.430 --> 02:41:56.550
But kind of comes with like levels of exposure.

2512
02:41:56.640 --> 02:42:01.260
<v 15>It does.
Yeah.
I just,
I don't know why like,</v>

2513
02:42:02.090 --> 02:42:05.310
well we were joking about it the other night or last night,
wasn't it?

2514
02:42:05.311 --> 02:42:10.050
When we got dinner?
Yeah.
Oh my God.
That would have to go.
Okay God time.

2515
02:42:10.110 --> 02:42:14.940
Well I was saying like for me it's feels almost like a bee sting where you get,

2516
02:42:15.120 --> 02:42:19.860
when you get stung more,
you become more allergic to it.
Oh,
I think I'm just,

2517
02:42:19.980 --> 02:42:22.740
I,
I think like I'm in a really like a

2518
02:42:24.510 --> 02:42:29.130
depressed place,
so maybe it feels more painful now.
Yeah.

2519
02:42:29.220 --> 02:42:30.020
Shut.
Yep.

2520
02:42:30.020 --> 02:42:34.010
<v 14>Oh,
I was going to tell you if you are bummed out,
don't go read your comments.</v>

2521
02:42:34.810 --> 02:42:38.570
Oh,
there's one right now telling me,
telling us we signed on.
You suck.
Yeah.

2522
02:42:38.930 --> 02:42:41.900
Cause I remember when like when I would be depressed and sometimes I would go,

2523
02:42:42.290 --> 02:42:42.801
you're like,
well,

2524
02:42:42.801 --> 02:42:45.440
either you're going to make yourself feel worse by looking at Twitter or looking

2525
02:42:45.441 --> 02:42:48.290
at the youtube comments.
Are you trying to look for a boost?
Right.

2526
02:42:48.690 --> 02:42:50.930
So either you're fucked either way.
Cause then you're like,

2527
02:42:50.931 --> 02:42:53.510
there's five good things and then one person fucking hates your guts.

2528
02:42:53.511 --> 02:42:56.720
So I learned in therapy when you're feeling depressed,

2529
02:42:56.900 --> 02:43:00.020
do not look at shit that will potentially make you feel worse.

2530
02:43:00.060 --> 02:43:03.410
Brain weirdly points you towards it.
Yeah.

2531
02:43:03.900 --> 02:43:04.810
<v 15>You crave it.
It's,</v>

2532
02:43:04.890 --> 02:43:09.890
and I know that and that's why it sucks because I'm right now fully disengaged

2533
02:43:11.860 --> 02:43:15.550
and I think that a lot of our fans are bothered by that because I'm very public.

2534
02:43:15.551 --> 02:43:18.940
I said I don't,
I don't read any comments.
I don't,
I'm not even on social media.

2535
02:43:19.480 --> 02:43:23.770
And the shame is that there's a lot of great people that I would love to connect

2536
02:43:23.771 --> 02:43:28.660
with,
but for me right now in the place that I am,
it's like you have to take,

2537
02:43:29.920 --> 02:43:34.390
if you don't want the bad,
then you can't take the bad without the good.

2538
02:43:34.391 --> 02:43:35.000
It's like you,

2539
02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:38.350
you either take the good and the bad or you don't take any of it at all.

2540
02:43:38.370 --> 02:43:40.750
That's true.
And I don't think I can take any of it at all.
Right.

2541
02:43:42.730 --> 02:43:44.120
<v 2>You should listen to yourself on that.</v>

2542
02:43:44.240 --> 02:43:46.670
<v 15>Yeah.
And so that's why I'm trying to like really disengage.</v>

2543
02:43:46.760 --> 02:43:49.980
<v 2>Good.
That's good.
Yeah.
That's actually a very,
it's a very self aware and,
and,</v>

2544
02:43:50.070 --> 02:43:55.070
and intelligent move on your parts and filter through what she is doing for you.

2545
02:43:55.251 --> 02:43:55.790
Right.

2546
02:43:55.790 --> 02:43:58.970
You're reading and keeping up and then if there's something he needs to see,

2547
02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:02.150
then he'll fucking see it.
Yep.
If not,
you don't want to see that shit.

2548
02:44:02.300 --> 02:44:05.930
<v 15>I feel like people have used that now.
The fact that I am disengaged.</v>

2549
02:44:06.780 --> 02:44:11.460
<v 2>Yeah.
Whatever,
whatever.
I'm dealing with it.
Yeah.
Good for you.</v>

2550
02:44:12.410 --> 02:44:16.450
Um,
all right.
Are,
are,
uh,
the students here to post stuff up.

2551
02:44:16.860 --> 02:44:21.410
Okay.
All right.
Do we,
um,
this was really the best.
