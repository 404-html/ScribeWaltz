really sent in some hits and um,
I've got a bunch of other songs.

35
00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:40.250

41
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.990
What an appropriate song for today's episode two is.
We're both,

42
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.670

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.950
I've just had normal bowel movements today.

44
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.660
You're the one that we need to really go back and do an autopsy and figuring out

45
00:04:14.661 --> 00:04:19.550
what's going on here.
It's not good.

47
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.640

You can't fake that.

48
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.140
Oh my God.
Seriously.

49
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.000
Oh my God.
Seriously.
There's a lot going on.
Well,

50
00:04:38.001 --> 00:04:42.040
why don't we do our proper show open?
Yeah.
That we can get into all of it.

51
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.870
She's doing homie.
What you doing?

52
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.260
[inaudible] going to show me.
Let's do this.

53
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.020
There we go.
That'll be helping me with this
reading.

54
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.270
They're nice and sheer.
Um,

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.920
Oh,

Okay.

57
00:05:09.201 --> 00:05:10.670
Now we can get a reading out of this.

58
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.630
<v 5>Uh
Huh.</v>

59
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.370
<v 6>Was Randy don't bring anyone loving to this.</v>

60
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.180
<v 1>Well go to your mom's house.
She told</v>

61
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.433
Christina

62
00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.050
<v 9>so much to cover today.
Nasty,
nasty as hell.</v>

63
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.310
So this is the worst one I would say.
Of all the things we've had on this show,

64
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.200
the Vegan Vagina guy.
Um,
I mean,
you know,

65
00:06:20.201 --> 00:06:24.130
dudes barfing like that for some reason.
Just really skeeves me out.

66
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.930
That's the worst of all.
Feels.
It doesn't feel good to me to watch that part.

67
00:06:28.931 --> 00:06:31.540
Why not as nasty as hell.

68
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.200
She called them that parent nasty.
Drowsy.

69
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:37.603
<v 10>Hmm.</v>

70
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.730
<v 9>She really liked that one.
That's the one you chose for the opener,
Huh?
Yeah.</v>

71
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.920
I all the clips submitted to us of all the potential dad boner things or,

72
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.300
Yup.
Hey Mommy.
Thanks gene.
That that's what you chose.

73
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.780
That's the one that I thought would upset you the most.
Yeah.

74
00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:59.930
Mission accomplished.
Nasty as hell.
It's so nasty.

75
00:06:59.931 --> 00:07:04.340
She reading vaginal discharge or discharge,

76
00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:09.230
she can read.
She can tell the future by her panties.
Oh,
her panties?

77
00:07:09.231 --> 00:07:13.840
Yes.
That's her discharge.
That's hers.
And she,
damn,
that is nasty as hell.
Yeah.

78
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:19.320
Yeah.
It's nasty.
He is the cheese.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Girl.

79
00:07:19.321 --> 00:07:23.450
I guy be so nasty.
Gross Dude.
It's really gross.

80
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.320
Why did you have to bring that into my life?
Pup play was nasty as hell.

81
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.680
Tell me all these nasty he healed.
This is just,

82
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:36.080
this might be that the the panicle.
Um,
so just to give you a little set up here,

83
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.003
the lady,

84
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.560
well why don't I let her say first five minutes of the show has been horrendous.

85
00:07:40.561 --> 00:07:44.960
It's,
it's all been shit.
Shit talk and now panty Talenti reading though.
Yeah.

86
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.280
She can read a psychic.
That woman if you,
you know,
it was hard to tell.
She can,

87
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.620
she can hold up her own panties and,

88
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.820
and like a psychic tell what's going to happen by what she's discharging I to

89
00:07:55.821 --> 00:07:56.690
them.
Oh,
okay.

90
00:07:58.660 --> 00:07:58.871
<v 8>Hi.</v>

91
00:07:58.871 --> 00:08:03.871
It's amber from listener near face.com and use panty selling if vice.com and I'm

92
00:08:04.271 --> 00:08:06.670
going to do something that I usually don't,

93
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.900
I usually just sort of a,

94
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:15.040
have it be private time before things are sent off to their new living home.

95
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.630
That beyond,
she's high as he calls it reading.

96
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.400
<v 9>Oh,
shades are serious too,
but she's stoned as hell.</v>

97
00:08:20.401 --> 00:08:23.830
You didn't tell her she got cotton mouth pretty bad.
Yeah,
she's,

98
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.880
she's whacked and she's got,
um,
the really big thick,

99
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.910
you know the sunglasses.
They're like,
they're like fucking,

100
00:08:30.911 --> 00:08:35.500
what do they call like blue blockers?
Basics.
There's no blue blockers.

101
00:08:35.501 --> 00:08:39.040
Let you see everything crisper and clearer.
Right,
right.
But there's no water.

102
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.590
There's no light penetrating.
Those are black,
black Jackie Onassis.
Um,
yeah.

103
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:47.110
If I can say,
dude.
Anyway,
go ahead.
I forget.
I'll remember

104
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.680
<v 8>have this long run.</v>

105
00:08:48.681 --> 00:08:53.681
It's a sheer aqua marine c k thumb and yeah,

106
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.700
it's a part of that resurrected collection that I mentioned a few weeks back

107
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.550
that was sent back to me for reimburse vacation.

108
00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:08.530
<v 9>That is nasty as house.
I understand.
I got it.</v>

109
00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.200
And like the 90s and then they're like,

110
00:09:11.201 --> 00:09:16.201
could you re nasty these isn't it nuts to make their living doing this?

111
00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:21.160
I think it's the most ingenious thing I've ever seen.

112
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:24.200
Aquamarine.

113
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:29.360
I mean if you're a woman with little education or means to create a living for

114
00:09:30.281 --> 00:09:32.860
yourself,
that's probably the best way to do it.
Well,

115
00:09:32.861 --> 00:09:35.200
you gotta be so gender specific.
Why can't a guy do it?

116
00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.870
I'm sure there are dudes that are like,
I love it guys.

117
00:09:40.871 --> 00:09:44.950
Filthy coarser but stained of course.
That's what I'm saying.

118
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.560
They'll cut us out.
I'm not kicking you out of the picture.

119
00:09:47.561 --> 00:09:50.640
I'm just saying that vaginal discharge is,
well yeah,

120
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:55.630
but I'm saying of course we were talking about vaginal,
but I'm saying you can't,

121
00:09:55.631 --> 00:09:59.620
you can't compete with vaginal juices is what I'm saying.

122
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.260
All that stuff.
Does it come out throughout the day though?

123
00:10:05.261 --> 00:10:09.490
Does it change with your cycles?
Probably not like that,
but I mean you can get,

124
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.070
you know,
you can get a little pre come

125
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.200
on those he was painting.
That's an interesting point too.

126
00:10:17.201 --> 00:10:20.590
And you can also get a little yellow because my step father,

127
00:10:20.591 --> 00:10:24.970
I remember my mother would wash his boxers and she would point out that there

128
00:10:24.971 --> 00:10:28.250
was yellow and brown.
Oh yeah.
Brown stains.

129
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.140
So you can yellow yellow for sure.

130
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.440
You can get you yellow on on yours.
I normally wear,

131
00:10:35.441 --> 00:10:40.060
I'm sure I normally have on black or gray boxers.
Right?
So we don't know.

132
00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:44.920
I'm going to switch you to white boxers only.
I'm going to start evaluating what

133
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.900
I kind of want you.
Let's send it to amber.
She can amplification it.

134
00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:56.110
<v 8>There we go.
That'll be helping me with this little reading.</v>

135
00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.100
They're nice and sheer,

136
00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:02.970
<v 9>um,
melded.
Let's see here.</v>

137
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.160
Oh Bitch,
let me go.
It'd be a,

138
00:11:08.161 --> 00:11:12.870
just turn up the,
okay,
now we can get a reading out of this.

139
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.820
God Damn.
Well,
first of all,
I mean,
look,
I'm not a doctor,

140
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.700
but if you're,
what's coming out of you,

141
00:11:20.701 --> 00:11:24.810
it add a [inaudible] coming out of your front is brownish intent.

142
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:29.720
You got an infection that's not normal,
that coloring now.

143
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.870
Well,
I mean,
I'm pretty sure.
Yeah,
it shouldn't,
it shouldn't be Brown.

144
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.660
I mean unless it's period stuff,
but

145
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.620
she got burned burnt by gonorrhea.
I mean if it's not a period thing,

146
00:11:43.621 --> 00:11:47.640
I'd be very concerned.
But I don't know,
maybe amber is menstruating,
I don't know.

147
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.080
And we're going to find out.

148
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.680
<v 8>So there's a little bit of an overlapping,
right?</v>

149
00:11:53.681 --> 00:11:56.350
There are two different colors,
kind of a melding.

150
00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:01.650
And what that suggests is that I'm going to get a massage today and then I'm

151
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:05.060
going to be giving somebody else in the Scottish.

152
00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:08.680
So like a little bit of an exchange going on

153
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:11.840
<v 9>the two over overlapping colors.</v>

154
00:12:11.841 --> 00:12:15.290
Tell her that there was a massage and her future.
That's what she is doing.

155
00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:18.890
Well that's really not fair because she knows what she's going to be doing today

156
00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.810
is that you can't do a psychic reading on yourself.
And then I'm touching this,

157
00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:27.490
right?
I'm going to have a doctor's appointment at four.
I mean,

158
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.760
you know what you're doing today.

159
00:12:28.761 --> 00:12:31.400
So if she could read my panties and be accurate,

160
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.980
then I'd really be surprised if she goes any further

161
00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:39.100
<v 8>and then,
um,
up or it's actually down cause I have these upside down.</v>

162
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.330
Um,

163
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:44.850
feeding onto the back portion of the phone right there.

164
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:49.620
God,
this is amazing.
It's a color which indicates that I will be fed.

165
00:12:49.621 --> 00:12:53.340
Well today.
You guys,
are we just gonna Cook for me

166
00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.580
<v 9>now is that planned or does she really reading the future?</v>

167
00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:00.920
Well that's what's problematic about this clip Tom,

168
00:13:00.921 --> 00:13:04.880
is I feel like we don't know if this is really accurate and we don't know if

169
00:13:04.881 --> 00:13:07.130
this is truly a psychic thing.

170
00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:11.060
I wonder if she's going to watch that hand after this.

171
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.110
It's her own mine.

172
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.810
You wash your hands after you touch your own.
Of course you never do.

173
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.850
You never wash your hands.

174
00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:24.410
I've seldom seen you and what you call hand washing is piss poor.

175
00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.910
Oh,
I've seen you,
you,
you and cold water.
First of all,

176
00:13:28.911 --> 00:13:32.480
everybody knows you have to use hot water height as possible and steaming.

177
00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:36.230
You do use coal.
Why you flip it on and then you've,
this is the stream.

178
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.290
You just flick your,
the tips of your fingers under it like this and then you,

179
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:44.360
you do like half a pump us up and then you kind of switch a it in your finger

180
00:13:44.361 --> 00:13:48.980
tips.
It's like a pea wash,
right?
It's a brown wash is different.

181
00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:54.130
Walk me through it.
Go ahead Brown.
I go hot water.
Two hands.

182
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.841
I Dunno man.

183
00:13:56.841 --> 00:14:00.540
At least five seconds to scrub the backs of your hands as well for that go

184
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:04.810
across surgery.
I'm just going to wash my hands.
You want to get another cold?
No,

185
00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:08.450
I want to get flu.
No,
wash the back of your fucking hands.
All right.

186
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:10.250
Maybe I will.

187
00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:15.830
<v 8>Well,
let's see here.
Oh,
back up to the top right there.
Damn Dude,</v>

188
00:14:15.831 --> 00:14:16.640
I thought we were done.

189
00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:21.640
Interesting little amber vacation going almost onto the sheer part of pants.

190
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:28.030
You right there and what that suggests is that I am going to take the most

191
00:14:29.181 --> 00:14:33.980
divine bath in the most divine outdoor

192
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:39.110
<v 9>lab.
What else?
Chick's got a great life.
I have to say.
It is a pretty good,</v>

193
00:14:39.111 --> 00:14:41.350
she's got a massage lined up.
She's got to,

194
00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:44.500
someone's going to cook dinner for her and she's going to be in the bathtub.

195
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:49.440
So you think she's mentally ill?
No,
I think she's mentally stoned.
Hi.

196
00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.980
Hi.
Hi.
And she that,
that would be funny.

197
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.650
<v 7>And then,
yeah,</v>

198
00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.700
you know when you get stone you think something's going to be funny and then you

199
00:14:55.701 --> 00:14:58.460
try it later and you're like,
oh,
it's not funny.
It was high thought.

200
00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:02.180
Could have been a pot thought and then no,
but a for effort,
you know,

201
00:15:02.181 --> 00:15:05.200
you got to put it out there.
You got to try.
Yeah.

202
00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:12.200
Well amber furcation and verification money,
I was like Braxton word.

203
00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.900
There's a lot going on yesterday.
Some of you might know was my smurf day.

204
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:22.490
And

205
00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.540
don't make yourself equal with the g.
Why?

206
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:35.020
Because G is g and t is t [inaudible] birthday to take g have a birthday to case

207
00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.820
such a fucking shit deck.

208
00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:46.160
So we had a nice little party at the house we barbecued.

209
00:15:46.161 --> 00:15:49.280
We had cousin Bri,
Bri over and yeah.
You know,

210
00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:53.660
cousin Yanette and my dad and babies and doggies.

211
00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:55.790
And it was fun.
I got it.

212
00:15:55.791 --> 00:15:58.790
I listened to you yawn as you talk about how French finally hands tired.

213
00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:03.380
I'm always tired.
It was a,
it was a fun time.

214
00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:05.420
The weekend I had a blast.

215
00:16:05.421 --> 00:16:09.020
I was in San Jose meet rattle and Portland,

216
00:16:09.021 --> 00:16:13.220
Oregon three and I approve of one of those cities.
Why,

217
00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.520
why in California?
Oh right.
It's still not la,

218
00:16:16.521 --> 00:16:20.510
but at least it's in the right state.
Of course,
the super elitist that you are,

219
00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:25.220
but I do enjoy Seattle and Portland.
[inaudible] those are fantastic cities.

220
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.180
I had a great time.
The shows were a lot of fun.
And actually,
um,

221
00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:33.470
for two of the cities meet rattle in Portland.
My cousin Bree Bree joined me.

222
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:38.540
It's adorable.
Yeah.
So for those of you that don't know,
Bree,
Bree and I,
um,

223
00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:39.980
you know,
we grew up together.

224
00:16:39.981 --> 00:16:44.750
We were next door neighbors for the first nine years of our lives and now we

225
00:16:44.751 --> 00:16:49.050
both live in La.
We both have babies around the same age too,

226
00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:53.330
around the same age,
which is cool.
So it was fun just to hang out and uh,

227
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.200
you know,
we had meals and just,
he just hung out backstage.
And you know,

228
00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.650
enjoyed the life,
the showbiz life showbiz baby.
Yeah.

229
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:03.270
So he came home and then so,

230
00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:07.790
so we had our barbecue and now today I made spaghetti squash.

231
00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:11.180
Like I got it from whole farts.
Yeah.
And I put some sausage in there.

232
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.980
I mean my sinuses are all fucked up.

233
00:17:12.981 --> 00:17:17.030
This morning I've been blowing boogers that are like neon yellow.

234
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.950
I was terrified by the way.

235
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:24.490
Monday we did this show Monday last week and we were both really sick and I was

236
00:17:24.531 --> 00:17:29.531
super legit scared that I was going to have the upcoming weekend because of how

237
00:17:30.021 --> 00:17:33.530
I felt.
I was like thinking,
I mean there's no way I can do this.

238
00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.550
There's a life wrecker that called.
I go out,

239
00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:39.130
there's no way I can do six shows in three cities like this.
No.

240
00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.500
And I got some meds and thank God I got through.

241
00:17:42.501 --> 00:17:47.240
It was did you take antibiotics?
I did.
Oh well that's why you're not,

242
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.980
because it's date 11 and I'm still sick.

243
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.820
<v 9>I'm still congested.
My snot has changed color.
It's a bright yellow.
Yeah,</v>

244
00:17:53.821 --> 00:17:55.860
you don't,
you're not as,
you know,
I'm fucked.

245
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.850
I got to go to the doctor and get those antibiotics,
man,
I think this is,

246
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:03.630
this is evil.
What's inside of me now our kids find though.
Yeah,
he's better.

247
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:08.940
So even though you have aids,
no,
I'm fine.
You,
yeah,

248
00:18:08.941 --> 00:18:12.330
I got to go get it.
I'm going to go.
Uh,

249
00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.480
so then I made spaghetti squash and I don't feel like eating anything.

250
00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.300
<v 11>This has been like a,</v>

251
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:22.340
a week long for me where like farts and,
um,

252
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:24.180
I have just been bad

253
00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:28.430
<v 9>and sour while you've been in three different cities in the last weekend.</v>

254
00:18:28.431 --> 00:18:33.260
So I'll always take into account different bacteria of the different cities.

255
00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:39.560
<v 11>Yeah.
And when I picked up these meds from the pharmacy,
um,
the lady was like,</v>

256
00:18:39.561 --> 00:18:41.330
have you taken this before?
And I go,
yeah.

257
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.570
And then when did you take it was an antibiotic,

258
00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:48.600
<v 9>just like penicillin,
not penicillin.
Like a variant of it.
Yeah.</v>

259
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:49.900
I'm oxys Phil.

260
00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:54.550
<v 11>I have to look up what it was.
But she's goes,
you taken this before.
And I go,</v>

261
00:18:54.551 --> 00:18:58.660
yeah.
And then I paid and as I walk away,
she goes,

262
00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.540
you could get diarrhea.
And I go,
thank you.

263
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.960
And I didn't get diarrhea from it,

264
00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.230
but the next day I started to have like just like rotten

265
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:13.990
<v 9>smelly.
Yeah.
And nothing feels good to eat when you're sitting.
I know.</v>

266
00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:15.970
I haven't eaten well in the last 10 days.

267
00:19:15.971 --> 00:19:18.430
I don't want to eat anything except melted cheese and crackers.

268
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.460
<v 11>Couldn't find the thing.
I was looking for it and it's like I just,</v>

269
00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:26.870
it was just terrible,
you know,
I just couldn't really figure it out.
And then,

270
00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:31.830
um,
when we got to Portland I was going to go to that,
uh,
fuck it.

271
00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.660
What's it called?
Some,
I think it has like a Vietnamese name.

272
00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:40.360
It's across the street kind of from the salt shake place.
Uh,

273
00:19:40.361 --> 00:19:41.230
it really popular.
Yeah.

274
00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:45.280
<v 9>Oh I've been there.
I've been there.
And you,
you get like your thing arise,</v>

275
00:19:45.281 --> 00:19:48.940
you meet and your veggies.
Is that the place?
I don't know.
Yeah,
dude,

276
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:52.250
I threw my name.
It's like a hole in the wall.
Cause Sorta.

277
00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:54.520
<v 11>Anyway,
maybe I'm thinking so,
um,
anyways,</v>

278
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:58.080
you put her name in and then they're like play 45 minutes.
And I was like,

279
00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:03.330
no way.
My waiting.
Let's get your entire fucking life together.
Yeah.
Yeah.

280
00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.530
So we walked down the street and there's like food truck,

281
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:11.220
uh,
like park basically love that area.

282
00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:15.940
And this is beautiful day outside and the university,
right?
Don't know Portland.

283
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.070
Yeah.
I'm not sure because,

284
00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:20.710
but there's probably like 12 trucks right in a circle and then like,
uh,

285
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.270
a central area you can hang out afterwards.
We're walking through it,

286
00:20:25.271 --> 00:20:30.271
trying to figure out what we're going to eat and then bribe right points out to

287
00:20:30.421 --> 00:20:32.660
me that there's a burger place and I said,

288
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:36.210
you can put your Burger on a field of Greens.
So I'm like,
perfect.
Right.

289
00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:40.430
I get some meat,
get some fat and get some veggies with it.
Like,

290
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:44.760
which is how I like to eat.
Right.
So I go,
I get it.

291
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.030
It was okay if I'm going to be honest.
It was just okay.
No,
it

292
00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:51.850
<v 7>was this one of those places where everybody's like,
you gotta eat there.
No,</v>

293
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.180
I wouldn't know because I'm just saying that like we were,

294
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.390
we were going to go to the really popular place and it was so packed.

295
00:20:58.391 --> 00:21:01.540
We walked down the street to this food truck,
little park.

296
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.510
And then anyways,

297
00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.750
if the place is the whole fucking park is packed,
people are,

298
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:09.070
are all over the place there.

299
00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:14.290
But I eat that thing and within 30 minutes I'm like,

300
00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.750
Oh man,
that didn't settle.
Well,

301
00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:19.600
part of that I think is I didn't have bread so I don't have anything absorbing

302
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.490
any of the,
yeah.

303
00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:25.030
Like fuck the Diet just to get whatever you can.
Yeah.

304
00:21:25.031 --> 00:21:28.450
That is sort of the best philosophy for that.
Anyways,
I eat it.

305
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:33.570
I have like really rotten farts and dumps out the rotten parts begin,

306
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:39.160
I would say.
I mean,
they all kind of were,
we're kicking,
you know,

307
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:40.330
throughout the week.

308
00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:45.310
But that Burger was on Saturday and that's the first time that's like,
Oh,

309
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:49.570
a pad.
And that's as far as,
I mean,
I just shot you who out of my ass.
You know,

310
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:54.910
this problem started back in on Saturday.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
So we're talking.

311
00:21:54.911 --> 00:21:59.070
Yeah.
Okay.
So your guts have been,
yeah,
they were just wrecked.
So then,
sure.

312
00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:02.980
Um,
after that we see where the hotel,

313
00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:06.160
I'm trying to remember where we ate next.
Um,

314
00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:11.590
and then yeah,
then we went to the show.
I don't,
I'm not remembering if eating.

315
00:22:11.591 --> 00:22:16.570
So I took one of my little pouches,
little like Keto food pouch.

316
00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.070
It's like 200 calorie thing.

317
00:22:18.071 --> 00:22:22.120
I ate just to have something to me a little bit after that.
And then I just had,

318
00:22:22.121 --> 00:22:24.910
it was drinking tea all week.
You know what's great about tea by the way?

319
00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:29.590
Every time I get sick I drink 40 cups of tea and I enjoy it.

320
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:30.760
And as soon as I get better,

321
00:22:30.761 --> 00:22:35.650
I abandoned t well t's good because it's comforting when you're,
you have a cold.

322
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:37.660
I know what I'm saying.
I like it so much.

323
00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:41.770
It's like I always try and get done.
I'm healthy.

324
00:22:41.771 --> 00:22:46.240
I don't like a hot beverage necessarily,
like a tea coffee though.

325
00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:50.510
I like how coffee makes me feel.
I don't like coffee with the coffee.
Okay.

326
00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.550
It's like beer.
I drink it to get fucked up.
My drinking it for the tape.

327
00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:00.640
Um,
so,
so,
but we'll wait a minute and then,
yeah.
And then,
okay,

328
00:23:00.641 --> 00:23:03.730
so I got you a juice from whole foods.
Let's go back to yesterday.

329
00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.430
Had Brussels sprouts.
I made you call.
It wobbles your favorite.

330
00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:10.480
I also had a lot yesterday.
My birthday,
I had some,
some meat,

331
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:14.380
some collywobbles,
um,
some chicken.

332
00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:19.300
And then from whole fire corn,
little corn salad,
cupcake,

333
00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:24.940
cupcake cake with a piece of that.
That was a lot of sugar.

334
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.550
A lot of sugar.
I'm not used to consuming,

335
00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:33.270
Yana allow me to present to the court my possible findings here.

336
00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:38.380
Okay.
I went to whole foods this morning and I brought you back the juice.

337
00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:43.480
Yes.
So let's go to this morning.
This morning I had a spinach and egg.

338
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.760
No,
no.
I'm going through all of it.
Right,
right.

339
00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:49.550
I'm having a spinach and egg scramble,
which is normal for me.

340
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.400
I have it all the time and it does nothing to me.

341
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:58.390
That is all I've had until you bring me the juice from whole farts.

342
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:03.680
I drink that.
I don't drink all of it.
I drink about,

343
00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.850
let's say close to half of it.
And then you made a,

344
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:10.210
what does that a spaghetti squash.

345
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:13.370
Squash Spaghetti and I got some whole farts.

346
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Getedge Zucchini and squash and noodle form and noodle form some whole fart

347
00:24:19.521 --> 00:24:20.840
sausage dude.

348
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:25.790
As soon as I took the last bite of that,
my insides went

349
00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:33.310
and then I ran to the bathroom.
Shit,
everything out.
Good for you.

350
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.380
And then 10 minutes later my stomach's going

351
00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:40.910
just rumbling,
man.
Terrible.

352
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:44.800
<v 9>I'm jealous because I'm backed up a little bit.</v>

353
00:24:44.801 --> 00:24:49.630
I even went to Korean food on Saturday hoping to loosen things up for me,

354
00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:53.470
but to no avail.
I took one shit after that.
Spaghetti squash,

355
00:24:53.471 --> 00:24:57.070
but it was a normal one.
So I,
you know what?
I think it is for you.

356
00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:02.350
I think it's the juice from wholefoods a,
but here's my argument against that.

357
00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.950
I have that juice sometimes and I'm okay,
but you're not listening.

358
00:25:05.951 --> 00:25:09.430
So it's the juice and your vegetable intake,

359
00:25:09.431 --> 00:25:13.180
which I know you historically,
you can't really handle vegetables.

360
00:25:13.181 --> 00:25:14.860
Your body like freaks out.

361
00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:19.300
I think it might be the spaghetti squash in conjunction with the collywobbles

362
00:25:19.301 --> 00:25:24.100
from last night.
And they choose the Jews,
the Jews,

363
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:28.150
the Jews,
the Jews did it.
Shoes.
Yeah.

364
00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:32.570
I don't know.
Different parts of your underwear.

365
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:39.250
It could be the sugar,
but I don't know,
but that's where I'm at.

366
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:42.250
So right now,
what do I do moving forward for the rest of the day?

367
00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:44.500
You have to eat carb.
You know when your,

368
00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:49.390
when your diary Ang you have to have like a pasta or something or crackers.

369
00:25:49.391 --> 00:25:52.960
He got to fuck the Diet.
Um,
you know,

370
00:25:52.961 --> 00:25:54.820
I had an epiphany though by the way,

371
00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:00.200
when I had Korean food on Saturday and I ordered their spicy Soondubu,

372
00:26:00.431 --> 00:26:05.431
it's like a tofu soup and I get it read like I like it very spicy now.

373
00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.660
Are you farting when you do
now?

374
00:26:10.661 --> 00:26:14.080
I had this epiphany because I was eating it and I was thinking to myself,
Gosh,

375
00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:16.990
in my early twenties I used to,
that's when I started eating this stuff.

376
00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:20.680
I used to get diarrhea every time that I would eat this soup.

377
00:26:20.681 --> 00:26:24.070
Like an hour later I'd be bent over on the toilet and pain,

378
00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:28.810
but now I can eat it.
And it doesn't even like a failure tolerance.

379
00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.220
Exactly.

380
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:35.310
It took a decade of eating Soondubu and now I can eat it in the sh and Kimchi.

381
00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.800
I can eat a whole trough of it and like it doesn't phase me.

382
00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.000
I went to Korea and I was the only one not to get diarrhea because I was,

383
00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:47.460
I show is going to the malls and eating that hot spicy soup and all the other

384
00:26:47.461 --> 00:26:48.294
white girls.

385
00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.433
<v 11>Hey,</v>

386
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:54.970
<v 9>it took a decade though cause that's how long I would shit after I would eat</v>

387
00:26:54.971 --> 00:26:57.740
Korean and then when they stop diarrhea.
When you did,

388
00:26:57.741 --> 00:26:58.960
when you started doing standup too?

389
00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:03.470
I had diarrhea for the first seven years of standoffs.
Not Crazy.
Yeah,
violent.

390
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.440
Just w w when I knew I had to set that night,

391
00:27:06.441 --> 00:27:09.380
I would wake up and start shedding and I would shit all day.
And then,

392
00:27:09.381 --> 00:27:12.440
then why did the Groundlings before that and then the Groundlings,

393
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:15.500
that was like an all day shit and then I would shit before the Groundlings.

394
00:27:15.501 --> 00:27:17.870
And then during the class break you remember you'd had a break?

395
00:27:17.871 --> 00:27:22.670
I was shit during the break.
I mean I was a nervous wreck for seven years.

396
00:27:22.671 --> 00:27:27.230
Easily.
Now.
How did,
did you get nerves like that for performing or

397
00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:31.670
<v 11>not diarrhea,
but I remember,
I remember the very first time I ever did stand up,</v>

398
00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:36.080
I woke up,
I had booked a like,
you know,

399
00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:38.540
it's a Saturday and a month kind of thing.
And I was like,
all right,

400
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:42.650
the week of I'm thinking about it,
you know,

401
00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:47.510
it was getting real and I remember I wrote out every single word.

402
00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:51.800
Yeah.
And I remember the night before,
you know,
really thinking about it.

403
00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.360
Right.
Reading and writing it over and,
and,
and being like,
oh my God,
you know,

404
00:27:56.361 --> 00:27:58.520
I have this tomorrow and the next morning,

405
00:27:58.521 --> 00:28:03.220
this is like when I'm obviously single.
I have nothing to do on a Saturday night.

406
00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:06.310
I snap out of bed at five 30 in the morning.
Like I,

407
00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:10.870
I wake up in a panic.
I'm like,
I'm doing stand,
hold,
sweat,

408
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:15.500
like that nervous.
And I remember having,
you know,

409
00:28:15.501 --> 00:28:18.180
for me it was like I can't eat,
oh yeah,

410
00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:23.190
<v 9>that sale.
I couldn't eat.
I would eat like protein bars,</v>

411
00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.280
but I would still,
shit,
I couldn't eat the night of the show.

412
00:28:26.281 --> 00:28:27.960
I might've eaten like a granola bar.

413
00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:31.910
<v 11>Really?
Yeah.
Um,
I did some</v>

414
00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.670
<v 9>and that's what I smoked cigarettes.</v>

415
00:28:34.671 --> 00:28:38.180
So I would chain smoke all day two out of nerves.
Yeah.
That was,
uh,

416
00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:41.840
when I think about it,
the re that havoc I wreaked on my immune system,
on my,

417
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:46.730
my adrenals are just fucking shot from the right.

418
00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.770
The first 10 years of stand up easily.

419
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.290
<v 11>There was a shot.
I remember the first time that I actually did it too.</v>

420
00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:59.240
I've said it before,
but I got a,
uh,
I got,
I got boobs,
you know,
and

421
00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:04.150
<v 9>not the first time you did it the first time.
Yeah.
You got booed.
Booze.</v>

422
00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:08.950
I was drinking.
I was who's,
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's dangerous.
Oh my God.

423
00:29:08.951 --> 00:29:13.670
I was terrified,
man.
Well,
of course.
Yeah.
I had the good fortune.
I,

424
00:29:13.671 --> 00:29:16.570
I took an actual standup comedy class,

425
00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:19.420
believe when I did that a million years ago.
This is,

426
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:21.850
I think I was in the Groundlings and I just want to know like,
oh,

427
00:29:21.851 --> 00:29:25.270
what stand up about?
And the teacher said one great thing.
He goes,

428
00:29:25.271 --> 00:29:30.271
don't get into the habit of drinking or doing drugs before you perform in the

429
00:29:30.521 --> 00:29:34.100
beginning because then it's a really hard thing to break later.
And I thought,

430
00:29:34.101 --> 00:29:36.580
oh that's,
that's good advice.
I'm going to try that out.

431
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.440
Cause that you really can't once you get hooked on doing it that way.
Yeah.

432
00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:42.250
I that uh,
Joe Rogan

433
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:47.010
<v 11>told me,
cause I used to smoke cigarettes around shows.
Oh yeah.</v>

434
00:29:47.011 --> 00:29:48.010
It wasn't a big smoker,

435
00:29:48.011 --> 00:29:53.011
but I started to get into the ritual of doing it like smoking before and after.

436
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.731
He was like,

437
00:29:54.731 --> 00:29:59.731
well what if you start like you're in demand more than you and you need to do

438
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:03.370
shows all the time.
Like you're working more than you are now.

439
00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:06.910
That's just going to make you smoke even more.
Like what,
you know what I mean?

440
00:30:06.911 --> 00:30:11.800
Like you're,
you're making it so that every time you do a set,
you're smoking.

441
00:30:11.801 --> 00:30:16.620
But what if you even start doing more sets that your health is going to yeah.

442
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:19.600
Yeah.
So I just started associated to,
and I was like,
Oh yeah,

443
00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:23.640
<v 9>yeah.
That's the danger.
You,
you make those,
those associations.</v>

444
00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:29.190
<v 11>I was 2010 I think.
Yeah,
that was the last time I smoked.
Yeah.
Good.</v>

445
00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.060
Good gene.
Yeah,
smoking is bad.
I did something.

446
00:30:33.061 --> 00:30:35.850
I don't know if you're going to be very happy with,
Oh God.

447
00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:40.140
I hope you don't get upset,
but I hope you can find the humor in it.
Uh,

448
00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:44.180
the last time we made love.
Yeah.
I hit an audio room

449
00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:48.970
<v 9>quarter in the room.
Oh,
you did?
Just audio.
Yeah,</v>

450
00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:49.903
that's fine.

451
00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:54.110
<v 11>So,
you know,
we're so close to our audience.
I figured,
you know,</v>

452
00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:59.030
let's share with them what I love making session two.
Married,
loving people.

453
00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:03.260
Yeah.
Okay.
So let me,
um,
as long as it's not the visual,

454
00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:06.050
I don't want people to see how gross we aren't,
they,
they won't see us,

455
00:31:06.051 --> 00:31:08.520
but here they're going to hear us and I hope that,
okay.

456
00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:13.010
I hope I'm not too embarrassed.
Yeah.
I hope you're okay with it.
Let's see here.

457
00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:14.253
Let's see if this,

458
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.860
<v 6>okay.</v>

459
00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:19.160
<v 11>Put music to it so that kind of give it a little extra flavor.</v>

460
00:31:19.161 --> 00:31:22.250
You know how you're so talented.
Yeah.

461
00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:27.580
<v 6>Like our ancestors worship each other floor.</v>

462
00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:30.040
<v 9>I mean there.
You know,</v>

463
00:31:30.041 --> 00:31:33.520
it's funny when I get into a such a frenzied state with you.

464
00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:34.750
I don't know what I'm saying.

465
00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:38.950
Worship me like our ancestors worshiped each other before.

466
00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:44.440
Yeah.
You're trying to say something more profound almost.
Well,

467
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:49.300
I was talking about the Egyptians.
I was reading about Tooton common.

468
00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:53.830
Yeah,
and it was just,
it's all stream of consciousness.
I was meditating earlier.

469
00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:57.010
Yeah.
I got smoked a little weed before we did it.
Interesting

470
00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:11.420
<v 6>fucking job.
Right?</v>

471
00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:13.860
That was a fun one.
Okay.

472
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:15.270
<v 9>Remember that time?
Yeah.</v>

473
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:18.330
<v 6>Did your daughters better ball Warsh</v>

474
00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:24.180
<v 11>this was a curious to me.
You said your daughter's,
can I be a better ball?
Worship</v>

475
00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:28.010
<v 9>me.
Great.
I'm lost.
You didn't remember.</v>

476
00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:30.750
You don't remember talking about that that high.

477
00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:33.920
We had a kid and we have a daughter or she'd be a ball worshiper.

478
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:36.410
You don't remember that discussion we had before we made last?

479
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:41.570
Yeah.
We were like,
who's going to be a better ball?

480
00:32:41.571 --> 00:32:43.570
Where Zuber our son or our daughter.

481
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:48.440
It was like we had that debate and then,
oh,
now I remember.

482
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.000
Yeah.
Okay.
Thank you.

483
00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:51.140
<v 6>No</v>

484
00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:04.110
[inaudible] [inaudible]

485
00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:09.930
<v 9>that was quite a night.</v>

486
00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:16.830
That was,
that was quite a night.
You're right.
Yup.
That was the night.

487
00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:19.880
I'm just embarrassed that you recorded that.
I mean,
I,

488
00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:23.070
you don't seem that embarrassed,
which I'm proud of you.

489
00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:27.470
You're owning who you are.
Well,
you know,
we're all at different strokes.
Yup.

490
00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.090
Same folks.
Same folks,
same strokes.

491
00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.700
<v 6>Talk to me like you're fucking white,</v>

492
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:06.010
<v 9>your fucking wife,
right?
Yeah.
It's a different fantasy we have.
Yeah.</v>

493
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:10.020
So you were like pretending like you're not my wife.
Right.
That's what we do.

494
00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:15.060
This is a,
this is crystal.
You're banging.
No,
you don't really,

495
00:34:15.061 --> 00:34:19.080
you're not really saying much here.
Well,
I'm so focused on how,

496
00:34:19.081 --> 00:34:22.470
on your performance.
That's what I was like,
wow.
Like,
you know,

497
00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.090
it was kind of lost in it.
Yeah.

498
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:30.800
Yeah.
I get,
I get carried away.
You always,
yeah.

499
00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:33.880
All it takes this one glass of Chardonnay and I really

500
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:37.103
interesting

501
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:42.430
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

502
00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:03.890
<v 9>I piped up there.
Yeah,
you were really aggressive there.
Yeah.</v>

503
00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:07.360
But you were coaching me into it.
You say like you wanted it.
Yeah,
I did.
Yeah.

504
00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.290
I was trying to be like,
hey,
you run this show and you said like say something.

505
00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:16.540
Say something stupid.
Yeah.
So you did I let you hear it.

506
00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.220
Wow.
Sounds like you wanted to hear it.

507
00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:24.240
<v 6>[inaudible] I tell you I got to start selecting your clips from now.</v>

508
00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:42.933
<v 7>We got to,</v>

509
00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:48.450
so far you've been really just hitting the high notes on this show.

510
00:35:48.911 --> 00:35:53.911
I mean Albany with the Panty lady and then the second clip as this.

511
00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:54.873
I mean

512
00:35:57.350 --> 00:35:59.530
he really need my help with the show a little more.

513
00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.920
I should've stepped in this week.
I'll be honest.
I wasn't feeling well.

514
00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:10.030
I mean where do we go from here?
I'm talking about you can't open on this.

515
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:14.030
I was about to close on this.
I was too excited to play it.
I've,

516
00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:15.220
I've found this one myself.

517
00:36:15.221 --> 00:36:19.210
This wasn't an art or is it just in your normal repertoire?

518
00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.300
This was just your weekend Brian.

519
00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:27.890
So proud of you.

520
00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.473
<v 6>Oh Man.</v>

521
00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:47.190
I think I got it.
I mean are we,
is there a lot more?

522
00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:51.380
<v 7>There's about another minute and a half.
Oh my God.
What's going to happen?</v>

523
00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.190
I feel like I know where it's at.
Of course you were there.

524
00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:56.893
<v 6>Fucking</v>

525
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.810
musics were really good.

526
00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.130
<v 7>I was thinking about the music.
Yeah,
it doesn't fit does it?</v>

527
00:37:06.131 --> 00:37:08.650
Here's what I'm imagining though now if it doesn't fit,

528
00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:13.540
but there's a couple of guys that play right.
And one of them is really like,

529
00:37:13.541 --> 00:37:17.440
he really has a passion for music and for him it's like

530
00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:21.160
he's just happy that he has another guy to play with.

531
00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:22.960
Like he's like the keyboard,

532
00:37:22.961 --> 00:37:27.961
the other guy does the guitar or whatever and the guitar guy sold it to these

533
00:37:29.081 --> 00:37:33.850
boring people and the other guy doesn't know yet.
He goes,
hey man,

534
00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:37.300
I actually got someone a license,
our music to feature film.

535
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:41.680
What did it fucking awesome.
Like I told you all this time it's going to pay off.

536
00:37:41.681 --> 00:37:44.890
Like we've been getting together.
We're getting serious about our music.
Yeah.

537
00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.070
And now you're telling me someone wants it in a movie.
Yeah,
man,

538
00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:52.840
somebody wants it in their movie and uh,
I just got a little clip of it.

539
00:37:52.841 --> 00:37:54.820
You can hear what we did in a movie now.

540
00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:12.480
<v 6>Oh,
I want to come on.</v>

541
00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:18.530
<v 7>She seems like a lot.
What does it sound?
Is it CSI?
What's that?
Music don't,
don't,</v>

542
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:24.320
what is that shit?
No,
that is,
uh,
don't,
don't,
that's law and order.
Yeah.

543
00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:27.800
It sounds like the law and order theme a little bit in order.
Yeah.

544
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.750
Well you had that on deck.
Yeah.

545
00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.750
That's the theme to dig detectives.
Oh,
right,
right.
Yeah.

546
00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:41.663
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

547
00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:52.480
<v 7>That was kind of a failed game for us only because it was hard to verify dicks.</v>

548
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:56.410
Dicks.
Like we,
you can only really theorize on what somebody's Dick looks like.

549
00:38:56.411 --> 00:38:59.890
And we've,
we just didn't have a lot of verifications.
Yeah.

550
00:38:59.891 --> 00:39:02.680
But it was fun to guess.
Yeah.
Maybe we'll,
uh,

551
00:39:02.681 --> 00:39:06.040
we'll play again in May when I have guests in May.
If we can find,

552
00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:09.670
if we could find a guest who would be willing to show us a picture of his dick.

553
00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:15.430
To do though is just,
is come up.
Even if they don't verify,

554
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:20.210
they take a stance on what it looks like.
It's the game.
So make a drawing.
Yeah.

555
00:39:20.211 --> 00:39:23.680
Something like that with crayons or write down the features that we go,

556
00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:27.870
it hangs on the left,
right.
It smells weird.
Right?

557
00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:32.830
Screen and then big balls.
Little balls.
High balls.
Yeah.
Fat sloppers.
Yeah,

558
00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:34.180
Harry.
There you go.

559
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:36.543
<v 12>Yeah.</v>

560
00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.790
<v 7>You don't have to play that clip anymore.
I'm good.</v>

561
00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.910
What part of it do you not like anymore?
It's just,
it's a long,
I mean,

562
00:39:44.911 --> 00:39:47.400
we did it for so long that night and I didn't realize,

563
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:53.340
I thought you would like it more.
I really did.
Hearing myself.
Yeah,
the playback.

564
00:39:53.341 --> 00:39:56.050
I'm so embarrassed.
I thought you would really like it more.
No,

565
00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.230
I didn't think you were.
Oh,
where's your water?
Tom?

566
00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:01.210
<v 12>Deal with your bullshit every day.</v>

567
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:06.650
<v 7>Oh,
okay.
I got it.
I mean,</v>

568
00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:13.070
I just,
I don't know why.
Why?
Why don't you have to have this?
All right.
All right.

569
00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:17.180
All right.
Don't,
don't you know your z via was a real hit yesterday.

570
00:40:17.181 --> 00:40:21.260
The Barbie people loved it.
Especially your father.
I know.

571
00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:25.310
He really enjoyed my cvs.
Now my dad likes shitty sodas though.

572
00:40:25.311 --> 00:40:28.610
He's a fool right now.
You've never said that sentence in your life.

573
00:40:28.611 --> 00:40:32.390
Now you're like,
he likes shitty sodas.
Well,
you know what his favorite one is?
No.

574
00:40:32.391 --> 00:40:36.290
Fresca all right,
sounds cool.
Frasca is gross and no,

575
00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.900
of course he's going to like your gross soda here.

576
00:40:38.901 --> 00:40:42.830
This will hopefully cleanse your palette choices.
So far.

577
00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:48.530
This is something a little innocent,
Fun Little Dad Boehner Club.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.

578
00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:52.640
<v 12>Oh,
hold on.
There we go.</v>

579
00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:55.733
<v 7>Boom,
boom.</v>

580
00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:01.200
<v 13>Late 18 hundreds community bottle dump is always a fun dig yesterday's trash.</v>

581
00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:04.280
Today's treasure.

582
00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:09.730
<v 7>First of all,
the fact that he did a real walk up,
you know,</v>

583
00:41:09.731 --> 00:41:13.720
standing on the intro for this,
like a television guy would write and he had the,

584
00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:18.730
the the bottle out of frame.
This guy is really committed to his dad.
Boner.

585
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:22.750
Passionate.
Yes.
Yup,
Yup.
Can't wear shredded close on camera.
It doesn't look,

586
00:41:22.751 --> 00:41:25.750
this is what these guys do.
They dig an old,

587
00:41:25.751 --> 00:41:30.190
an old dump sites for things like bottles,
you know?

588
00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:34.210
All right.
We're just starting to open it up.
We've got a

589
00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:39.410
<v 9>wood and John Chavon,
Gargoyle Ridge.</v>

590
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:47.390
You can see the stratification and got a layer of rust here and then getting

591
00:41:47.391 --> 00:41:50.750
into the ash layer.
These guys,
I mean,

592
00:41:50.751 --> 00:41:54.230
how fucking bored do you have to be to think this is interesting.
I know,

593
00:41:54.231 --> 00:41:54.830
and they're,
they're,

594
00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:59.830
they're dig like they're digging in the woods where people dump the bottles 200

595
00:42:01.971 --> 00:42:04.190
years old.
It's like I'm a landfill,
right?
Yeah.
And they're like,

596
00:42:04.191 --> 00:42:09.191
look at all the trash is he read lady where the ash had other trash.

597
00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:15.670
<v 5>Oh,
look at the time.
That's total the caucus stolen at all.
That's crazy.</v>

598
00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:20.360
Look at that.
Yeah,
it is.
Yeah.

599
00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:22.810
I'm in Chicago.

600
00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:28.840
Oil's got some motion cod liver oil that sweet with lime and soda.

601
00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:32.560
How?
I love the toad.
Yeah,
me too.

602
00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:36.350
<v 9>Wow.
Getting nerd.</v>

603
00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:40.850
A bunch of dorks.
Abby Birthday.

604
00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:45.640
How old are you now?

605
00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:47.873
<v 14>Yeah,</v>

606
00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:51.690
<v 5>we got a blue.</v>

607
00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.630
Oh,

608
00:42:57.690 --> 00:43:02.290
Delf deangelis providence.
Oh,
that's cool.
Oh,

609
00:43:02.291 --> 00:43:06.100
I know Joe.
Joe.
We were in someone else's bag.

610
00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:13.660
<v 9>Dude.
That's a real to just,
just his pants over an old bottle.
Yeah.</v>

611
00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:18.280
You found a bottle.
He fucking trash.
This guy is excited about trash.

612
00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:19.570
No further record.

613
00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:23.710
This was for you playing this over.

614
00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:41.270
Okay.
Thanks Ben.
Yeah.
Don't.
All right,

615
00:43:41.271 --> 00:43:44.900
let's go to John's here.
See what shot big medicine.
It does have a sunken,

616
00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:48.680
Oh yeah,
panel.
Oh,

617
00:43:48.681 --> 00:43:53.030
that's it's that whole mass.
Barilla.
Barilla,
yeah.

618
00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:56.270
Oh yeah.
The whole,
the whole,

619
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:58.990
have you ever dug one John Smith's crosswords?

620
00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:05.240
Hopefully this one.
He got a cracked one earlier.
Let's hope this is a whole one.

621
00:44:05.241 --> 00:44:09.950
Looks good.
Get that fucking nerd.
Wow.

622
00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:14.340
I really stoked about these bottles,
Huh?
Yeah.
Well glass bottle.

623
00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.140
<v 14>Yeah.</v>

624
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:19.463
<v 15>Okay.</v>

625
00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:23.843
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

626
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:27.100
<v 14>Ah,</v>

627
00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:34.350
<v 9>it's for,
for a bottle glass bottle.</v>

628
00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:37.550
Was the glass bottle that much better back in the 18 hundreds?

629
00:44:37.551 --> 00:44:40.060
It's just fucking door cause they have nothing to do.
Yeah,

630
00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:45.120
they live in some awful place.
You know,
like you say,
that's as a terrible place.

631
00:44:45.121 --> 00:44:49.980
Wherever that is.
It's definitely not la.
It's not interested.
Not Interested.
No,

632
00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:54.780
not uh,
no.
I mean I guess it's nice to have hobbies and stuff.

633
00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:57.730
<v 11>I know I'm sort of jealous of that.
By the way.
Can we bring this up</v>

634
00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:00.430
hobby wise?

635
00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:05.970
I have for many years expressed my interest in aviation

636
00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:10.350
<v 9>and I've taken a flying lesson.
I don't think my eyes can roll,</v>

637
00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.400
crawl back in my head.
Farmer.
Now

638
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:17.450
<v 11>I've told you I want to continue my pursuit of a pilot's license.</v>

639
00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:24.380
And your proposal is that we come up with a formula where a certain amount of

640
00:45:26.431 --> 00:45:29.100
blow jobs will equal yes.

641
00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:31.980
Not getting a pilot's license.

642
00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:35.080
<v 9>Exactly.
Now I asked you,</v>

643
00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:39.790
how many blow jobs would it take for you to lose interest in helicopter
piloting?

644
00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:44.490
Yeah,
so let's do the math.
Let's go.
I mean,
obviously I'm,
uh,

645
00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:48.400
I'm congested now,
so,
you know what I mean?
Can you have some mercy?

646
00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:53.300
<v 11>Yeah.
Well,
here's the,
okay.
To receive a private pilot license,</v>

647
00:45:53.301 --> 00:45:58.301
the FAA requires student pilots have a minimum of 40 hours of flight time.

648
00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:02.010
Um,
let's see.

649
00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:07.260
So I think we should do something like some tradeoff for

650
00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:11.830
how many blow jobs can you do in an hour?
Probably like five

651
00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:16.780
<v 9>an hour.
Oh,
come on.
Let's be real.
You're 38.
You're not 28 or eight.
No,
no.</v>

652
00:46:16.781 --> 00:46:20.680
I'm saying how many could you do to other people like you and

653
00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:25.920
<v 11>no,
I'm saying 40 hours are required.</v>

654
00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:30.150
So if you were going to do 40 hours of blowjobs,
you could probably give out,

655
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:34.890
you know,
200 blowjobs.
I think you should be about 200 blow jobs.

656
00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:39.750
But they need to be,
you know,
obviously to completion,

657
00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:41.130
obviously facials,

658
00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:45.250
<v 9>obviously.
Yeah.
Why?
Obviously facial,</v>

659
00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:48.760
<v 11>because you're crushing a dream with these blessings guy to like,
you know,</v>

660
00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:50.050
fulfill.
Yeah.

661
00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:54.810
<v 9>Yeah.
But I'm not crushing the dream.
I'm,
I'm fulfilling dreams too.</v>

662
00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.420
Don't forget that.
Yeah.

663
00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:59.430
How a blowjob you think you could give to like a whole group of people.

664
00:46:59.431 --> 00:47:01.830
You should go off at that one.

665
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.320
You give me the number and let's negotiate because I don't like this hobby.

666
00:47:07.321 --> 00:47:10.140
I don't want you flying.
I have a relative that was killed in a,

667
00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:14.430
he was a pilot for many,
many 30 years and was killed flying.

668
00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:16.920
So I'm very biased against,

669
00:47:16.921 --> 00:47:21.330
and don't fucking send me emails telling me how safe it is.

670
00:47:21.331 --> 00:47:25.230
I had a relative die,
so I don't fucking care.
I don't care.

671
00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:26.640
And he flew for a living.

672
00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:30.220
<v 11>Here's what I'm saying,
blow jobs</v>

673
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:35.150
<v 9>that you give.
I mean,
I think it'd be different if I was like,</v>

674
00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:37.210
didn't you know it wasn't close to you?

675
00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:40.630
Like if I was just like your friend and you're like,
I don't want you to fly,

676
00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:43.930
then you're like,
what if I give you blowjobs?
It's like that's pretty much right,

677
00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:48.190
but as your husband blowjobs are part of the relationship as it is,

678
00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:52.180
I'm offering bonus material,
don't you get it?
But then like how,

679
00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:57.210
which blowjobs are like life blow jobs in which our pilot blowjobs

680
00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:03.100
I'm saying what the number is going to have to be much higher because there'd be

681
00:48:03.101 --> 00:48:07.560
blow jobs anyways.
Bam.
Because you're,
look,
you're,

682
00:48:07.561 --> 00:48:09.970
you're getting greedy.
I can ingredient being honest.

683
00:48:09.971 --> 00:48:11.450
Do you understand what I'm actually trying to say?

684
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:15.850
You're saying what's the surplus amount versus the regular?
There you go.

685
00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:18.580
That's a legit question.
Well,

686
00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:21.460
you need to think about it and then we have to come up with some numbers and

687
00:48:21.461 --> 00:48:22.181
we'll negotiate.

688
00:48:22.181 --> 00:48:26.560
And also in what timeframe will they be in a lifetime lifetime.

689
00:48:26.561 --> 00:48:28.810
Come on.
We're married for life.

690
00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:33.490
So these are going to be blowjobs from getting in 20 years for the pilot's

691
00:48:33.491 --> 00:48:37.540
license.
Okay,
fine.
Three years.
That's a better answer.

692
00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:38.873
<v 2>Okay.</v>

693
00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:47.160
<v 9>Okay.
I think,
um,
I have a really good proposal for you.</v>

694
00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:53.240
No negotiating.
How was that an assignment and a proposal then?

695
00:48:53.241 --> 00:48:56.930
You're a dictator.
Just do one a week.
Every week for three years.

696
00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:03.080
What about sickness kid thing?
You get a pass on sickness when?

697
00:49:03.081 --> 00:49:07.340
A week for how long?
For years.
How long?
Three years.

698
00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:12.380
And you'll never talk about this piloting license again.
I think that's,

699
00:49:12.381 --> 00:49:13.970
um,
know I in writing.

700
00:49:13.971 --> 00:49:18.971
I want our attorney to draft up a legally binding document that for the rest of

701
00:49:20.271 --> 00:49:20.871
our marriage,

702
00:49:20.871 --> 00:49:25.871
I never fucking hear about pilot license or flying or race car driving.

703
00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:30.350
Wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait a minute.
I can get you killed is not,

704
00:49:30.351 --> 00:49:33.530
I was not your honor.
That's not part of the negotiation.

705
00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:37.780
We're talking about flying only cars are now part of the equation races.
I'm,

706
00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:40.460
but you don't want to race car drive.
I'm just saying like why?

707
00:49:40.461 --> 00:49:43.610
Why you have to have a hobby that can potentially kill you and take you away

708
00:49:43.611 --> 00:49:47.060
from your sonic.
Not Know.
That's a silly argument.
What do you mean?

709
00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:51.380
Since the probability increases with danger?

710
00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:53.570
Now flying is one of those things.
It's a hobby.

711
00:49:53.810 --> 00:49:56.660
You can't equate deejaying Dj,

712
00:49:56.661 --> 00:49:59.840
dad mouth with flying course.
You can,
there's Molly,

713
00:49:59.841 --> 00:50:03.980
there's percosets or you don't take drugs.
You don't know if one of my Dj gigs,

714
00:50:03.981 --> 00:50:05.520
what I do,
Dj Gigs,

715
00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:10.880
gigs gigging,
man,
I'm totally good and Bro,

716
00:50:13.070 --> 00:50:17.310
right?
So let's,
let's fucking keep talking.
Let's keep the dialogue open.

717
00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:22.140
Dialogue is open.
Um,
it cannot include cars of any time.

718
00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:26.520
God,
nobody wants to hear that and he wants to be,

719
00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:31.700
that's not yellow anymore.
God.
Nobody wants to hear that.

720
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:36.230
I eating,
I want to do it.
If you,
if you're going to go ahead and blow your nose,

721
00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:45.780
<v 11>what is wrong with her?</v>

722
00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:50.790
It was me and me with you or whatever.
What was Indio that day?

723
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:55.620
<v 9>I had my shark Ne,
you know,
and that's one glass.</v>

724
00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:59.950
<v 11>I'm crazy.
I mean,
I think as long as you know you're willing to do them,</v>

725
00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:04.770
you're willing to up them with a costumes and scenarios,

726
00:51:04.771 --> 00:51:07.580
role play,
et Cetera,
then it's fine.
Like,
and you got to do,

727
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:12.280
you've got to wear your glasses.
Um,
you got to say things like,

728
00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:15.990
you know,
I can't,
I can't see when there's no come on my glasses,

729
00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:16.843
things like that.

730
00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:21.550
Then you know that I'm willing to negotiate with you and it's so dumb.

731
00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:27.950
<v 9>You're the one word that you're the worst husband than ever.
Ever role play.</v>

732
00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:30.490
<v 6>Yeah.
The lot of sticky calm in those emails</v>

733
00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:32.600
<v 11>you got.
Stay that to me every single time.</v>

734
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:36.770
You have to say that to me every time you want to do it,

735
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:43.340
you do it.
I'll stay out of the sky with the answer.

736
00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:48.820
<v 9>I have to.
We have to talk more.
I can't just agree to it blindly on the</v>

737
00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.060
<v 6>Oh,
nice.</v>

738
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:52.583
<v 11>All right.</v>

739
00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:55.340
<v 9>You know what's going to happen if I agree with on the show.
Yeah.</v>

740
00:51:55.490 --> 00:52:00.490
Then our listeners are ravenous and they will make meticulous know of everything

741
00:52:00.721 --> 00:52:04.290
I say.
And then I want to petition are the illegal problem for me

742
00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:06.700
<v 11>or lessons for something.
And I just remembered,</v>

743
00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:12.040
this is something I'm going to ask you.
Um,
and I'm serious.
I want you to do this.

744
00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:14.650
You have any coming those bulls.
I wanted to see if you have coming your balls.

745
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:19.710
I also am going to ask you if you have not yet to write a review.

746
00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:24.490
Five stars obviously of our show on iTunes.

747
00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:26.830
And there's a reason that I'm asking you to do this.

748
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:31.270
If you don't know a lot of,
uh,

749
00:52:31.271 --> 00:52:32.920
on the business side of things,

750
00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:38.220
a lot of those people pay attention only to the iTunes charts.

751
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:44.430
And there's a misleading thing about the iTunes charts in that people can rank

752
00:52:48.551 --> 00:52:53.551
highly on those iTunes charts who don't necessarily have the most people

753
00:52:54.821 --> 00:52:55.900
listening to their show.

754
00:52:55.990 --> 00:53:00.990
And the reason that's important to note is because they then we'll get the

755
00:53:01.901 --> 00:53:06.901
benefit of the presumed bigger show in any number of business conversations.

756
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:14.560
So like I could be talking to,
I dunno,

757
00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:19.150
I'm just making this up,
but like a,
a book agent about a book and Oh,

758
00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.490
the shows this or that and,
and then they go,
okay,

759
00:53:21.491 --> 00:53:26.491
well so and so did a book and they're ranked 15th on the iTunes chart and that

760
00:53:27.751 --> 00:53:30.180
was helped that helped them with their book.

761
00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:35.570
You guys are 41st but then I'll find out even just talking to the person ranked

762
00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:41.460
whatever on the charts that we have a bigger show.
So if you're wondering,

763
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:46.740
well then why do you know,
why did they get ranked higher?

764
00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:51.770
One of the factors in the algorithm for iTunes podcast charts is reviews.

765
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:59.510
And you'll notice that a lot of the consistently higher ranked shows have

766
00:54:01.530 --> 00:54:03.300
thousands of read reviews.

767
00:54:03.301 --> 00:54:06.780
And what I also found out is a lot of shows solicit those.

768
00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:08.540
I feel like,
you know,

769
00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:11.820
I know that in when we did our first probably 20 or 40 episodes,

770
00:54:11.821 --> 00:54:15.660
we asked you to do that.
I'm going to ask you to do it again.
Um,

771
00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:18.900
I mean obviously if you've done it,
you've done it,
but I'm going to ask again.

772
00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:20.573
If you've never listened,

773
00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:25.580
if you've never written a review and you have an iTunes account and you don't

774
00:54:25.951 --> 00:54:28.690
mind spending a moment riding a,

775
00:54:28.691 --> 00:54:33.000
a review of our show and you can make them as jeans terrific as you want,

776
00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:36.750
I think it would be beneficial to us.
So that's what I'm asking you to do.

777
00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:40.860
If it's not too much trouble,
um,
I think we could easily,

778
00:54:40.861 --> 00:54:42.090
I know how many people is in the show.

779
00:54:42.091 --> 00:54:46.170
We could easily get thousands of more reviews and that would in turn,

780
00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:49.680
it's an easy way to benefit the show.
So that's my,

781
00:54:50.250 --> 00:54:52.740
my pitch on it and I hope you'll consider doing it.

782
00:54:52.830 --> 00:54:56.180
<v 7>No.
How many blow jobs where you give the audience for that?</v>

783
00:54:56.210 --> 00:55:00.380
There's no way I can do that.
There's no way.
What do you mean is it's possible?

784
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:04.070
How is it possible?
Anything's possible.
You can set up a blow job tour.

785
00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:09.430
The Thompson girls suck it for reviews and then no one gets in a line position,

786
00:55:10.611 --> 00:55:13.850
rents out an auditorium and you just give a blowjob after blowjob or how,

787
00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:16.940
how exhausting that would be and how sick I would probably get

788
00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:24.260
is blowing all of our fans who wrote an iTunes review.
Yeah,
it's already,

789
00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:29.060
how sick would you get?
Really sick?
Well,
from what?
Well,

790
00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:33.320
I mean all these different does dicks then smells and and,

791
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:38.630
and just so many different styles and stuff and just all of them.

792
00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:42.590
How many could you do in one day though?
I don't know.
Let's be realistic.

793
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:46.640
More of the expert in this field.
I mean,
it depends on how fast people are,

794
00:55:46.850 --> 00:55:48.910
you know?
Just because you suggested that Emory

795
00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:58.560
<v 6>fucking work,
you're women.</v>

796
00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:06.350
<v 7>Well,
that's what I'm saying.
What's in it for them,
you know?
Well,</v>

797
00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:07.830
a blow job from Thompson [inaudible].

798
00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:10.940
I'm just suggesting that was a horrible idea.
I can't believe you.

799
00:56:10.941 --> 00:56:14.000
It's helped me out like that.
You know what's interesting?
The iTunes ranking,

800
00:56:14.001 --> 00:56:16.130
you're right,
because it also only goes by,

801
00:56:16.131 --> 00:56:20.840
I'm assuming in part by the downloads on iTunes there their thing,

802
00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:22.790
but that's not how it works.

803
00:56:22.791 --> 00:56:27.420
The downloads are also through stitcher streaming through complicated thing,

804
00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:31.540
android,
whatever the fuck people are on,
it's not the only platform in town,

805
00:56:31.541 --> 00:56:34.930
so it's just as soon as they hear,
it's not just down on those.
Now,

806
00:56:34.931 --> 00:56:37.690
if you have like an incredible amount of downloads,

807
00:56:37.691 --> 00:56:42.691
like if you have tens of millions like Joe or like a cereal,

808
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:45.430
yes,
you'll stay at number one,

809
00:56:45.431 --> 00:56:49.060
two or three because you have the overwhelming downloads.

810
00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:51.160
But I'm telling you,

811
00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:55.070
there are people that have a third yeah.

812
00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:58.680
Of our downloads that are ranked higher than us.
So it was like that's,

813
00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:00.310
it's not fair that the,
uh,

814
00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:03.640
it only matters because it's not an ego thing where I'm like,

815
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:04.870
I just want to be ranked higher.

816
00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:10.020
It only matters when people start giving consideration to that as if it's a

817
00:57:10.841 --> 00:57:15.370
bigger show.
Right.
That's when it matters.
So anyways,

818
00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:19.530
so weird system.
I'm curious to know how they bagged out.

819
00:57:19.531 --> 00:57:23.200
I've never fucking heard of.
We're in the world of podcasts,

820
00:57:23.201 --> 00:57:26.290
so you kind of know what's out there and I'll look at those and I'll be like,

821
00:57:26.291 --> 00:57:27.610
dude,
who,
well,

822
00:57:27.611 --> 00:57:31.110
there's also this thing where they give benefits to also to new shows.
Yes.

823
00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:33.750
They give him that and that that was done.
That's,

824
00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:37.830
that's by design to give a new show opportunity boosts.
Yeah.

825
00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:42.640
Which I mean,
I understand that for sure.
This is just,

826
00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:45.160
it's just too much fun.
We're having too much fun right now.

827
00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:50.600
<v 9>This graphic shows how airflow travels and heat is transferred inside an angle</v>

828
00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:54.600
too bad regenerative thermal oxidizer.
Oh my God.

829
00:57:55.230 --> 00:58:00.230
Process gasses are pushed into the inlet main fold of the Rto via a system fan.

830
00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:06.090
These volatile organic compounds.
Hazardous air pollutants.
Fuck is,

831
00:58:06.091 --> 00:58:09.570
we didn't to the first bet of ceramic energy recovery media,

832
00:58:10.110 --> 00:58:11.980
they are progressively heated pool.

833
00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:14.970
<v 7>Wow.
That was bad.
That was a really boring,</v>

834
00:58:15.090 --> 00:58:17.790
at least she had a kind of a neat voice though.
It wasn't like a dude.

835
00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:19.530
You know who else has a neat voice?

836
00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:27.990
You got to say stuff like that and the blow job negotiation.

837
00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:31.080
I can't talk and give one at the same time.
Take it out for a second.

838
00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:38.600
<v 12>Um,
what,</v>

839
00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:44.280
<v 7>let's see if you can solve this mystery girl they didn't.</v>

840
00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:48.390
T carry are investigating the theft of up to 60 sheep on one brand.

841
00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:53.030
One of the farmers is offering a reward for information leading to the return of

842
00:58:53.031 --> 00:58:58.020
the use,
which are worth thousands of euro.
Oh that's right.

843
00:58:58.030 --> 00:59:01.410
Then your own domain and finding that

844
00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:07.730
this is a matter of accent.
Oh,
that guy is,
no,

845
00:59:07.731 --> 00:59:12.731
so I understood the news casters they use when the Udalls but this is other

846
00:59:13.581 --> 00:59:17.090
levels.
60 sheep had been stolen from this poor man.
Oh,

847
00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:19.110
let's see what he has to say about Mike.

848
00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:22.460
He is convinced over 40 sheep have been stolen.

849
00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:27.680
<v 16>Possible aid.
They'd be a hormonal around latent,
should be right out in academia.</v>

850
00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:29.420
One opened the mountains about night.
Sure.

851
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:38.670
<v 7>I wish this guy ran the great British baking show.
Wow.
Why?</v>

852
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:39.763
What

853
00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:44.150
<v 16>Mikey is convinced over 40 sheep had been stolen.</v>

854
00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:48.590
Possibly an eight.
That'd be a homeowner possible at night.

855
00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:52.660
Beautiful morning and lightens and students are being priced out in academia.

856
00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:54.470
Entrepreneur by nature.

857
00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:57.020
<v 7>There's something about it's bright out.
It's Friday night.</v>

858
00:59:57.021 --> 01:00:01.430
Yet the moon shines possible for anyone.
So for liquor,

859
01:00:02.170 --> 01:00:04.790
drink it now.
Okay.

862
01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:20.900
He has no teeth pain.
Well he has some,

863
01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:25.890

Let's hear that again.
Oh,

864
01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:30.860
oh look like sheep kind of dark and dingy.
That is dark.

865
01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:31.850
That is rough.

866
01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:36.960
<v 16>Well that was frosty five sheep miss.
Well it was 45 sheep.</v>

871
01:00:53.521 --> 01:00:54.450

Just learning right.

881
01:01:29.810 --> 01:01:34.060
This isn't like a foreign accent syndrome whereby yeah,

882
01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:37.520
English as a second language.
This is this guy's primary.

Today's video.
It's not a different video.

Listening to this.
I move my headphones on.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:34.830
<v 11>Totally not checked into his friend vomiting.
I think it's pretty good video.</v>

967
01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:39.780
It's a good clip,
but as usual,
you're not.
You're not here.

968
01:07:39.781 --> 01:07:44.670
You know you're somewhere else.
All right.

969
01:07:44.671 --> 01:07:47.160
This one doesn't have any vomit,
I promise.
How about this?

970
01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:51.890
Do you think it's annoying when people do up speak?
Like speak?
Yeah.

971
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:53.540
<v 9>You're lying and you're like,
no,</v>

972
01:07:53.541 --> 01:07:56.160
I just want to wait until I see it before I put my headphones on.

973
01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:57.240
You got to hear it?
Nope.

974
01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.540
You go ahead and put the clip up first and then I'll put my headphones on if I'd

975
01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:04.590
be as,
you're one of the great mysteries of the culinary world and since,

976
01:08:04.591 --> 01:08:08.070
how can there be a recipe for re fried beans when there's no such thing as a

977
01:08:08.071 --> 01:08:08.970
fried bean recipe?

978
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.610
<v 11>This is so much up speak.
You don't know how to speak.</v>

979
01:08:12.970 --> 01:08:17.470
Listen to this intonation as it goes.
Yeah.

980
01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:21.020
<v 18>Refried beans or one of the great mysteries of the culinary world since,</v>

981
01:08:21.021 --> 01:08:24.500
how can there be a recipe for re fried beans when there's no such thing as a

982
01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:25.400
fried bean recipe?

983
01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:30.090
<v 9>Usually girls,
they Terry much,</v>

984
01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:35.720
when they go like this and they're like,
oh my God,

985
01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:40.620
like honestly,
seriously,
that's,
here's a some,
oh,
speak to,
no,

986
01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:53.371
<v 18>I'm going to go ahead.</v>

987
01:08:53.371 --> 01:08:57.770
And so one pound of Pinto beans and cold water over night and like everything

988
01:08:57.771 --> 01:08:58.221
these days,

989
01:08:58.221 --> 01:09:01.460
there's a lot of controversy on whether you should do this or not and I'll let

990
01:09:01.461 --> 01:09:04.910
you do your own research on that.
But I've been to being soaker from way back.

991
01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:08.920
So I did let mine soak in cold water for about tower and is exciting.

992
01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:13.010
Which point they should look something like this.
Is it like this?
It's so weird.

993
01:09:13.230 --> 01:09:15.050
Bizarre.
And we'll add a couple more ingredients,

994
01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:20.060
including some peel garlic as well as a little bit of Eczema or calling up his

995
01:09:20.061 --> 01:09:23.270
otay,
which unless you grow it is not that easy to find fresh,

996
01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:25.780
but it is much easier to find a niche dried form.

997
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:29.480
And I'm going to go ahead and add a couple of pinches of that in case you're

998
01:09:29.481 --> 01:09:32.690
wondering,
this is sort of an extra strong sort of Minty Oregano.

999
01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:35.720
And if you can't find it,
some dried Oregano will do just fine.

1000
01:09:36.090 --> 01:09:40.550
<v 9>Well,
jazz by everything is,
is up to the speed.
Oh,</v>

1001
01:09:40.690 --> 01:09:44.310
that's done.
I do.
That's fine.
What a Gaylord.
Huh?

1002
01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:49.830
Such a Gay Lord.
There's no need to do that.
Well why is he doing this?

1003
01:09:49.930 --> 01:09:52.410
She's like a real homo.
Oh Hey,
that's not nice.

1004
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:54.263
<v 6>Oh,</v>

1005
01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:58.290
<v 18>but anyway,
we will bring that to a boil and once it's happened,</v>

1006
01:09:58.291 --> 01:10:00.980
we're going to do three things.
So where did they get us here?

1007
01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:04.020
We're going to reduce our heat to low,
low.

1008
01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:07.590
You're going to let this simmer uncovered for about an hour and a half or so or

1009
01:10:07.591 --> 01:10:09.180
until your beans are soft.
Oh,

1010
01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:11.790
so this is what mine looks like about 90 minutes later.

1011
01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:13.710
We'll go ahead and check these for done.

1012
01:10:14.290 --> 01:10:18.830
<v 9>Done.
This is redundant.
Yeah.
I mean that's probably just,</v>

1013
01:10:18.930 --> 01:10:23.450
you think it's a lifetime of that building.
Are you talking like that?

1014
01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:28.490
I think he's,
I'm reading copy.
Yeah.
And trying to make comfortable.
Yeah,

1015
01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.290
right.
Should I make an affliction?
Yeah.

1016
01:10:30.291 --> 01:10:33.210
He's trying to make it interesting cause he's reading it by a piece by piece.

1017
01:10:33.211 --> 01:10:37.180
So he's trying to be exciting.
So he said don't be afraid.
Don't give that Lard.

1018
01:10:37.230 --> 01:10:42.110
And he'll starts to Brown up who bound.
I don't be afraid yet.
What do you prefer?

1019
01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.740
Somebody with ups speak,
so don't be afraid.

1020
01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:48.090
Let it cook amounts of barfing and you're going to play pro or vocal.

1021
01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:52.110
<v 19>Megan and I have been together for nearly three years.</v>

1022
01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:55.590
She's a beautiful girl who I am very much in love with and I have a lot in

1023
01:10:55.591 --> 01:10:56.370
common with

1024
01:10:56.370 --> 01:10:58.560
<v 9>up speak all day.
What about you,</v>

1025
01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:01.290
<v 18>and I thought this was getting pretty close right here.</v>

1026
01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:04.820
<v 9>Definitely up speaking vocal fry,
vocal fry.</v>

1027
01:11:04.821 --> 01:11:09.290
You guys can hear it if you're new to the show.
It's when it's,

1028
01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:12.740
people don't realize it's actually deliberate.
You're,
yeah,

1029
01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:13.900
you're trying to sound like your

1030
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:17.700
<v 11>board.
Think that that's the way somebody speaks.
It's not,</v>

1031
01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:19.500
it's always a force thing,

1032
01:11:19.501 --> 01:11:24.501
but it can be so much a pattern for you that you don't even think but to go like

1033
01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:28.100
that.
It's actually actually I think like,

1034
01:11:28.110 --> 01:11:32.430
and again we'll do it to sound like I'm bored or whatever.
And again,

1035
01:11:32.431 --> 01:11:34.890
you usually hear it more with women.
Yeah,
it's a thing.

1036
01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:38.760
We happen to have two examples of men doing it.
It's just bananas.

1037
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:42.680
<v 19>Megan and I have been together for nearly three years.</v>

1038
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:46.190
She's a beautiful girl who I am very much in love with and I have a lot in

1039
01:11:46.191 --> 01:11:48.710
common with.
I can't I to get home and jump in the pool

1040
01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.033
<v 9>and the pool.</v>

1041
01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:55.940
I will say I'm proud that he didn't say me and Megan because me and something

1042
01:11:56.101 --> 01:12:00.690
has become the new norm with grammar and it's making me bananas.
Is it really?

1043
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:04.950
Oh,
I can't stand it.
You never say me and so and so.
Me and Tom,

1044
01:12:05.490 --> 01:12:08.970
I know Tom and I are Tom and me depending on the rest of the sentence.
Yeah,

1045
01:12:09.630 --> 01:12:14.310
we have makes me crazy.
That doesn't bother you.
I know and me and Tom,

1046
01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.860
I don't like it.
Me and Megan,
you fucked hard.

1047
01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:21.050
<v 11>Some emails came in.
You've probably been told this already,
but you're smelly.</v>

1048
01:12:21.051 --> 01:12:24.410
A C and your car is most likely due to a dirty cabin filter.

1049
01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:27.020
The air filter inside your,
your rides.

1050
01:12:27.021 --> 01:12:28.880
If you don't feel like getting them replaced,

1051
01:12:28.881 --> 01:12:31.910
just rub your finger along your crack and smell it and take a whiff.

1052
01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:36.140
Then the AC won't seem so bad.
Take it to any oil change place.

1053
01:12:36.141 --> 01:12:40.760
They can glass your filters and then have dad boners when they charge you about

1054
01:12:40.761 --> 01:12:45.670
$200 to replace it.
Make sure you stay hydrated.
While you wait.

1055
01:12:45.710 --> 01:12:49.430
Yeah.
Right.
Jeans and sampling a double pipe classic.

1056
01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:53.440
It is worth to get done though.
So your car's won't smell like the gays.
Uh,

1057
01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:58.630
feel better Steve and fart nicks in parentheses.

1058
01:12:58.731 --> 01:13:02.850
Don't assume my gender.
Um,
thank you Steve for that.
Uh,

1059
01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:06.080
and this is amazing.
Here we have uh,

1060
01:13:06.170 --> 01:13:09.230
a Zim sent in an email.
It says,

1061
01:13:09.231 --> 01:13:11.720
Hey Mommy buns and Tina,

1062
01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:17.660
I'm here to give you some insight to the life of a frequent wash cloth user.

1063
01:13:17.690 --> 01:13:21.620
Oh my God.
Please.
Not only do I use a washcloth in the shower,

1064
01:13:21.621 --> 01:13:25.940
I happened to use three yes,
three washcloths,

1065
01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:27.500
one for my face,

1066
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:32.950
one for my body and one very special washcloth for getting deep down into Brown

1067
01:13:34.901 --> 01:13:37.760
town.
Hmm.
I know it sounds like a lot of laundry.

1068
01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:41.540
It's well worth it and I encourage my favorite mommy's to give it a try.

1069
01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:46.760
The be whole wash cloth is usually used for my extra nasty king ass ripper

1070
01:13:46.761 --> 01:13:48.860
browns that happened frequently.

1071
01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:54.310
I don't have the luxury of a washlet after making spicy browns and screaming big

1072
01:13:54.501 --> 01:13:55.520
words on the toilet.

1073
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:59.840
This is the best solution I've come up with so far.

1074
01:13:59.841 --> 01:14:04.730
Any other solution are welcomed and embraced.
Keeping it high and tight.

1075
01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.230
Never low and loose.

1076
01:14:06.231 --> 01:14:11.030
Much loved in my mommy's p s use extra bleach and the wash.

1077
01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.610
Yeah.
Nash.

1078
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:16.630
<v 9>Wow.
That's from Nash.
So he's just saying that he's extra nasty.</v>

1079
01:14:17.050 --> 01:14:19.600
He's saying he's very nasty.
He farts

1080
01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:24.700
and he um,
you know,
he has a,
a dirty,

1081
01:14:24.701 --> 01:14:29.130
so he'd rather use a wash cloth then use his hand.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1082
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:30.420
We are,
um,

1083
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:35.440
obviously hand to ask washers in this house and I don't care.

1084
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:38.170
For those who don't know,
we're,
you know,
we're very much

1085
01:14:39.970 --> 01:14:44.320
endorsers of the handout as well because then you can just wash your hand with

1086
01:14:44.321 --> 01:14:48.690
the soap.
That's what the soap is.
Four.
So it was for doing that.
Yeah.
You know,

1087
01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:51.360
the soap kills that bacteria.
You think you're,

1088
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:53.710
you're going to get on your hands anyways.

1089
01:14:54.190 --> 01:14:59.190
I also want to add to the blow job negotiation that every time right before you

1090
01:14:59.831 --> 01:15:03.810
start,
you have to say,
you have to say it.
Okay.

1091
01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:06.880
You mean I don't go?
He got any covering those bowls.

1092
01:15:10.050 --> 01:15:14.380
You can try that.
Those bulls.
You got any common those balls?

1093
01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:19.180
I like that one.
Of course I do better.
Of course.
Of course I do.
Idiot,

1094
01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:22.150
what a stupid question.
It was always combing those bones.

1095
01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:26.680
You dumb fuck you rhetorical.
Fuck.
So you got an eight.
And he's like,
mmm,

1096
01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:29.960
tastes good,
too.
Really Nasty.

1097
01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:37.000
Uh,
when do you,

1098
01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.770
uh,
when your toilet paper,

1099
01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:43.290
do you fold or do you crunch up in a ball fold?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,

1100
01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:46.060
I think crunching up in a ball is for savages.
I mean,

1101
01:15:46.330 --> 01:15:50.680
how do I go over I you do the mittens,

1102
01:15:50.681 --> 01:15:54.280
the shit 100%.
I bet my father bunches up.

1103
01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:58.630
But then let's do it right now.
I've got this role.
See this is right.

1104
01:15:58.631 --> 01:16:02.230
So you go like this,
right?
Here we go.
And then what?
He goes like this.

1105
01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:07.300
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
But that doesn't even,

1106
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:11.840
he's so nasty.
I bet you he does.
That doesn't cover enough surface area.

1107
01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:14.440
Just a ball and none of that.
There's a lot of gaps.

1108
01:16:14.441 --> 01:16:18.520
So your knuckles can get shitty.
Now that's silly.
Here's what I do.

1109
01:16:18.521 --> 01:16:22.510
I'll show you right here.
Here's what I do.
Ready,
Huh?
Yeah,
I do like,

1110
01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:27.310
I'll be all like,
hold on.
You know like this dude,
I do like that.

1111
01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:31.900
I'm fucking put like a shit and men and then that's how I roll.

1112
01:16:32.410 --> 01:16:34.440
Let me see what you do.
Here's what I do.

1113
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:37.600
This is the perfect amount.

1114
01:16:37.601 --> 01:16:41.860
This is exactly like how much I would use on a brown wipe.
Hello?

1115
01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:47.050
I'm trying to get this phone call ready.
I'm gonna try to call him and ask him.

1116
01:16:47.810 --> 01:16:52.690
Wait,
but,
but real talk.
Listen.
Okay.
This is enough for my brown.

1117
01:16:52.930 --> 01:16:56.200
I want to see how much you use.
Okay.
This is what I know for a yellow,

1118
01:16:56.201 --> 01:17:00.520
I would use like a quick,
don't look,
don't let you let you do yours.

1119
01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:04.940
I do mine and then let's do
this would be a good for a wipe

1120
01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:11.300
look how much less use.
Oh that's it.

1121
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:14.420
I use like double what you use.
Do you use so much?

1122
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:17.000
Because I don't want this shit to touch my hand.

1123
01:17:17.001 --> 01:17:21.290
I want to make sure that there's enough of a barrier.
Beep you use like two.

1124
01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:26.740
There's only two tissue layers between your hand and your butthole was this

1125
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:30.710
terrible babe.
You got to use more.
We can afford it.
Do it.

1126
01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:34.570
<v 20>I do on occasion.
It just depends on the left,
but on a normal way.</v>

1127
01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:38.280
It's been for godly man.
Fucking

1128
01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:42.870
<v 9>why do either of my parents have phones?
Your mother never answers.</v>

1129
01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:44.520
It's so annoying.
So annoying.

1130
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:48.450
And like Ellis will be doing something super cute and we'll try to facetime or,

1131
01:17:48.451 --> 01:17:52.650
and she'll never fuck it.
Answer.
Yeah.
So now let me ask you this.

1132
01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:56.670
When you make yellow,
do you have to wipe your penis ever?

1133
01:17:57.630 --> 01:18:02.220
No.
No guys,
don't what?
You don't wet the dribble.
Isn't there a dribble?
I mean,

1134
01:18:02.221 --> 01:18:03.580
maybe when you were at 80 or something,

1135
01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:04.720
<v 20>but no,
I don't do it.</v>

1136
01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:11.870
<v 9>He's so little.
This is not even enough for me.
Let me see.</v>

1137
01:18:11.871 --> 01:18:13.270
Let me hold it is enough for a yellow light.

1138
01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:14.980
<v 21>No,</v>

1139
01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:18.440
<v 9>that's enough.
I'm like,
I might go a little thicker.
Yeah,
you're fine.</v>

1140
01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:19.993
<v 21>Really.</v>

1141
01:18:21.010 --> 01:18:24.510
<v 9>Wait a minute,
but don't you dig when you wipe,
you got to get in there.</v>

1142
01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:25.580
<v 21>I mean,
I'm saying on it</v>

1143
01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:29.690
<v 9>regular,
just like I'm wiping,
this is fine,</v>

1144
01:18:31.150 --> 01:18:35.060
but for me every way was a dig wipe.
If I'm wiping brown.

1145
01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:40.180
True.
You're not wiping thoroughly.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1146
01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:45.050
And actually,
and after the a washlet one,
like a home one.
Oh,
it's definitely a,

1147
01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:47.660
well,
it's different.
Yeah.
The bid day is like,
you know,

1148
01:18:47.661 --> 01:18:52.250
you barely have to wipe after the big day now isn't it gross to be on the road

1149
01:18:52.251 --> 01:18:55.580
and to shit without a bad day?
Yeah.
Why don't you feel horrible?
What I do,

1150
01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:58.940
I use a lot of sinks,
you know?
Really?
Yeah.
What do you do?

1151
01:18:58.990 --> 01:19:03.260
Spread my ass in the sink and let the water run through.
Do you shit the shower.

1152
01:19:03.261 --> 01:19:04.000
You should

1153
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.020
<v 21>just kosher at the shower.</v>

1154
01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:10.470
<v 20>No,
I don't do shit to shower,
you know,
chat or</v>

1155
01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:15.770
hey,
it's your son.
Oh my gosh.

1156
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:20.480
You just go in the house of course.
And no one answers the phone.
It goes,

1157
01:19:20.481 --> 01:19:24.020
I sold one to one.
Okay.
You don't have to say the whole number.

1158
01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:29.000
Um,
what are you doing?
No,

1159
01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:32.270
talking on the phone with you.
So you just didn't answer.
Where's dad?

1160
01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:37.100
She went to the gym.
She should be home really soon.
Okay.
Let me ask you this.

1161
01:19:37.130 --> 01:19:38.990
When you make,

1162
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:44.110
when you wipe for a Gaca Yeah.

1163
01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:49.240
<v 9>Do you fold the paper over or do you just bunch it up like put it in a ball</v>

1164
01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:53.800
<v 20>is in most disgusting conversation.
Again,</v>

1165
01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:58.900
I tell you what went to talk about Ellis.
No,
no,
but which do you do?
We will.

1166
01:19:58.901 --> 01:20:03.520
We will hold the paper.
You fold it.
Of course.

1167
01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:08.790
Do you think dad does not?
Do you know that for a fact?

1168
01:20:09.630 --> 01:20:11.820
No,
I never got to watch and green [inaudible]

1169
01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:17.910
excuse me.
Let me check your [inaudible].

1170
01:20:19.650 --> 01:20:23.850
I can possible imagine him taking now that you ask it person come in very,

1171
01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:27.360
it's more questions I can possible imagine your five fold in impacts.

1172
01:20:27.570 --> 01:20:28.830
What about you?
Do you fold it?

1173
01:20:28.930 --> 01:20:32.770
<v 11>I do fold it,
but I told Christina cause we were having as I go,</v>

1174
01:20:32.830 --> 01:20:37.060
I bet $1,000 that my dad bunches it up into a ball.

1175
01:20:38.290 --> 01:20:39.310
<v 20>I cannot get in the bed.</v>

1176
01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:44.950
<v 11>Can you get into bed?
The Bet?
Oh yeah,
yeah.
Oh yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.</v>

1177
01:20:44.951 --> 01:20:46.300
Yeah.
What do you think?

1178
01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:51.960
<v 20>I don't think it pulled us.
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah,
yeah,</v>

1179
01:20:54.490 --> 01:20:57.820
yeah.
That's right here.
Right now.
I like to spread.

1180
01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:01.460
<v 11>What do his do you,
do you ever,
okay.
How about this?
Do you ever,</v>

1181
01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:06.490
let's say you're traveling and you had a,

1182
01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:10.100
uh,
uh,
you know,
whatever,
you didn't bring enough underwear.

1183
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:14.240
Do you ever fold your underwear inside out and where this,

1184
01:21:14.330 --> 01:21:16.250
the outside as your underwear,

1185
01:21:17.850 --> 01:21:19.400
<v 20>what's happening is I,
it's my,
I know.</v>

1186
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:24.590
<v 11>No,
I'm saying,
I'm saying in the scenario that you don't have enough,</v>

1187
01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:27.440
would you just fold your underwear inside out and where that,

1188
01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:32.120
<v 20>no,
I watch it at night.
I'm 80.
Hopefully it would be dying.</v>

1189
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:35.230
<v 11>But would you ever do what I'm proposing?</v>

1190
01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:40.320
<v 20>I don't think a way that it can dry</v>

1191
01:21:42.910 --> 01:21:46.220
your percentage intuition,
that doesn't happen to me,
but yes,
I will follow this.

1192
01:21:46.221 --> 01:21:46.740
Ida.

1193
01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:48.470
<v 11>Okay.
And like,
even if they're,
let's say,</v>

1194
01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:53.480
<v 20>wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.
I have to be really stupid.
If I am going on a trip,</v>

1195
01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:55.910
the first thing I'm counting how many days I'm going on,

1196
01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:58.250
the first thing I put is counting under work.
Extra.

1197
01:21:58.690 --> 01:22:00.560
How in the world I'm gonna end with no underwear.

1198
01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:04.600
<v 11>Yeah,
somebody's stolen.
That's what happened.</v>

1199
01:22:05.530 --> 01:22:06.363
<v 20>Okay.
Yes.</v>

1200
01:22:07.170 --> 01:22:10.690
<v 11>Yeah.
And how about this one?
Let's say you have Gaca.</v>

1201
01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:12.710
<v 20>I know.</v>

1202
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:22.420
<v 11>Oh,
hold on.
Hold on.
This is the last one.
This is the last one.
Is it?</v>

1203
01:22:22.421 --> 01:22:24.850
Okay.
Is it okay if,

1204
01:22:27.790 --> 01:22:31.330
if you,
if you get caca on the inside of your underwear,

1205
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:35.590
is it okay to fold it over and just where the outside,

1206
01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:40.710
<v 20>absolutely.
No,
no.</v>

1207
01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:46.260
I'm folded inside out.

1208
01:22:47.050 --> 01:22:52.050
So we're going to your pants and you will know what is it?

1209
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:56.430
This is the most disgusting conversation.

1210
01:22:58.290 --> 01:23:01.390
Number one is impossible to happen to me.
Maybe for you.

1211
01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:06.260
I had the feeling that we just happened to you to buy 103.
That's not exciting.

1212
01:23:06.290 --> 01:23:08.910
You're one with Brian,
you to 100 words for the present day.

1213
01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:11.290
You turned inside out the next day you put in your path,

1214
01:23:12.370 --> 01:23:14.680
and then when you don't know what to do to you,
put it back and use it.

1215
01:23:14.681 --> 01:23:17.770
The Cacao Nibs.
But I am,
oh my God.

1216
01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:21.340
And you afford to buy any on your work?

1217
01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:24.180
<v 7>Uh,
I'm going to try to,
I'm going to get some more.
Yeah,</v>

1218
01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:30.420
I'm going to get some more being a dummy.
She's right here.
Christina.

1219
01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:34.740
Christina.
I'm here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What about it?
I mean,
this is my life.

1220
01:23:35.490 --> 01:23:39.420
Yeah,
she's hearing it here.
It,
it's just part of life.
So do you,

1221
01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:42.660
do you watch top dogs boxers by any chance?
Oh yeah.

1222
01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:44.220
Do you ever Wash Dad's underwear?

1223
01:23:46.090 --> 01:23:48.710
<v 20>What do I give it?
It's the only person who it at me.</v>

1224
01:23:49.050 --> 01:23:51.240
<v 7>Okay.
And what do you want to know?</v>

1225
01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:56.360
<v 20>Any,
I have literacy.
Caucus is underwear.
I never see anything.</v>

1226
01:23:56.510 --> 01:23:58.150
I even,
this is disgusting,
but anything,

1227
01:23:58.170 --> 01:24:00.470
it's melon because I'm not sure if he's there to clean.

1228
01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:05.100
<v 7>Oh,
you're so brave.
And then do you ever see yellow though?</v>

1229
01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:07.080
<v 5>No.</v>

1230
01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:08.160
<v 7>No yellow either.</v>

1231
01:24:08.890 --> 01:24:11.500
<v 20>If I ever see yellow,
if I happened once or twice,</v>

1232
01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:15.490
I get it with two fingers and put it sideways.

1233
01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:18.340
I can spray it before that.

1234
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:21.320
<v 7>Well,
no.
And then you never see Brown streaks in the underwear.</v>

1235
01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:26.740
<v 20>You know,
it used to be in the old times,
she did have that.
Oh,</v>

1236
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:28.530
I only have to repay it in a long time.

1237
01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:32.350
<v 7>Charles,
I gotta I gotta grab this call.
I'll call you back.
I love you.
Okay.</v>

1238
01:24:32.351 --> 01:24:36.970
Love you.
Bye.
Hello?
Hello.
Hey Tom.

1239
01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:42.600
Hey Dad.
Hey,

It's your son.
Big Dog.
Hey,

1240
01:24:42.601 --> 01:24:46.080
what's up man?
I didn't recognize the number.
I know I'm calling you from back.

1241
01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:51.600
How was it?
Just come back from the gym dad workouts or up to an hour now?

1242
01:24:51.630 --> 01:24:56.050
Great.
I'm very happy for you.
That's great.
I have,
um,
I got,

1243
01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:59.310
I got it.
I got a serious question.
I gotta ask you.

1244
01:25:00.290 --> 01:25:00.840
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1245
01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:03.270
<v 18>Okay.
Hold on.
Let me do a fart.
Okay.
Did the part time.</v>

1246
01:25:04.530 --> 01:25:08.050
<v 7>So,
um,
when you take a dump,</v>

1247
01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:13.500
do you fold the paper over or you just bunch it up and wipe with it?

1248
01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:17.620
He bunches.
Oh,
I'm a bunch of,
you're a bunch or

1249
01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:20.030
<v 18>yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.</v>

1250
01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:23.360
<v 7>I knew it.
You know that I knew it.
We had a bet going and I knew it.</v>

1251
01:25:25.190 --> 01:25:29.760
<v 18>Folders or OCD.
People need break.
Yeah.
You know,
uh,</v>

1252
01:25:29.890 --> 01:25:32.540
it's not good people that didn't actually,
you know.

1253
01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:35.610
Well that's for all my dirty clothes in the laundry hamper and miss.

1254
01:25:36.890 --> 01:25:38.120
I get it in the morning.
Okay.

1255
01:25:38.190 --> 01:25:39.023
<v 7>You know it's,</v>

1256
01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:42.930
I know it's me that my problem with bunching is it like if I'm looking at paper,

1257
01:25:43.290 --> 01:25:45.670
if I bunch,
um,

1258
01:25:46.710 --> 01:25:50.370
if you get some and you wipe with a bunch and you happen to look at it,

1259
01:25:50.850 --> 01:25:53.790
you could release some of that paper and have it all spread out.

1260
01:25:54.090 --> 01:25:55.380
It gets like real messy,
right?

1261
01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:59.680
<v 18>No,
never gets messy.
You have to know how to do it,
get yourself,</v>

1262
01:25:59.681 --> 01:26:03.270
makes you a plenty of paper.
And then you know,
I always go in for the wet ones,

1263
01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:04.153
the kind of,

1264
01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:07.430
and then I do a couple of weapons and make sure I got it all in and go back to

1265
01:26:07.431 --> 01:26:10.130
the dry ones and ever.
My,
the very last one,

1266
01:26:10.131 --> 01:26:12.500
I kind of punch it in the bottle hole a little bit,

1267
01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:15.150
make sure there's not something kind of oozed out.
Wait,

1268
01:26:15.151 --> 01:26:17.480
see you and you puncture yourself a little bit with it.

1269
01:26:17.810 --> 01:26:22.760
Like you actually push it in
just a little bit.
It's just kind of a hard place.

1270
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:25.910
Make sure I don't go all the way in,
but just around in the head,

1271
01:26:25.911 --> 01:26:30.040
you know what I mean?
Sure.
Doesn't,
it doesn't kind of leak out and,
uh,

1272
01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:35.230
you know,
end up in your underwear.
And so I,
you know,
I got this down pat and uh,

1273
01:26:36.130 --> 01:26:39.760
and then I did one of my,
well,
my one final one.
There's nothing on it.
I know.

1274
01:26:39.761 --> 01:26:40.594
I'm good to go.

1275
01:26:40.670 --> 01:26:41.780
<v 11>Wow.
That's pretty good.
I mean,</v>

1276
01:26:41.781 --> 01:26:45.380
we have a couple other scenarios we wanted to ask you about underwear.

1277
01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:48.650
Do you feel like it's okay to wear underwear inside out?

1278
01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:50.913
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

1279
01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:56.200
<v 18>sure.
I mean,
you know,
I'm trying to become more planet sensitive,</v>

1280
01:26:56.201 --> 01:26:59.800
you know,
and um,
a lot of things that,
you know,

1281
01:26:59.801 --> 01:27:03.430
I understand that we all have to take care of the planet and waste.

1282
01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:05.040
You know what,
I grabbed the California,

1283
01:27:05.041 --> 01:27:10.041
you get those real efficient toilets where one button for a piss and to another

1284
01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:15.190
button for a dump.
Okay.
Yeah,
we don't have those here in Florida.
Okay.
Right.

1285
01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:19.810
Um,
we're,
we're not weight,
not that far advanced.
So,
you know,

1286
01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:24.160
I figure I can,
uh,
if I just turn him honorary inside out,

1287
01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:27.150
they can't do that with boxers that you can deal with grief.

1288
01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:31.770
<v 11>Gotcha.
Now do you feel like,
um,</v>

1289
01:27:32.110 --> 01:27:36.820
this is a scenario,
let's say somebody has an accident in their underwear.

1290
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:41.140
How about flipping them inside out?
If you have no other underwear,

1291
01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:43.070
is that acceptable or no?

1292
01:27:43.410 --> 01:27:45.180
<v 18>No.
At that?
No,
no,
no,
no.</v>

1293
01:27:45.181 --> 01:27:49.060
You just got throw the hat and that happened to me in Orlando.
You remember?
Yeah.

1294
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:51.940
Yep.
Accident.
You just got to clean your butt up real good.

1295
01:27:52.210 --> 01:27:53.800
And you just got to throw the underwear away.

1296
01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:57.010
<v 11>Hmm.
No scenario,
Huh?
Yup.</v>

1297
01:27:57.550 --> 01:27:59.980
<v 18>No scenario now cause it ends up in your draft.</v>

1298
01:28:00.990 --> 01:28:04.500
<v 11>Oh yeah.
I never thought of that part one.
If your trousers get muddy.
Yeah,
yeah.</v>

1299
01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:07.110
That's what I'm saying.
But no,
the housers we'll get money out.

1300
01:28:08.690 --> 01:28:13.490
<v 18>I think you just,
when you have that,
that one episode where you,
your,</v>

1301
01:28:13.491 --> 01:28:16.240
your underwear,
it got messy.
You just have to make sure you're,
you're,

1302
01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:19.840
you're kind of clean there and then hope for the best.
Okay.
No,

1303
01:28:19.890 --> 01:28:21.140
you can get to put their underwear.

1304
01:28:21.570 --> 01:28:25.630
<v 11>Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow.
Interesting.
Did you tell him,</v>

1305
01:28:28.030 --> 01:28:30.440
<v 18>I'll tell you what I do now.
Yes.
This is,</v>

1306
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.840
I do not carry an extra set of underwear in my carry on luggage.
Wow.

1307
01:28:36.130 --> 01:28:37.300
Josh,
then k

1308
01:28:37.410 --> 01:28:42.210
<v 11>you told me the other day that you farted and then you knew exactly what was</v>

1309
01:28:42.211 --> 01:28:43.044
coming.

1310
01:28:43.450 --> 01:28:43.970
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1311
01:28:43.970 --> 01:28:47.550
<v 18>You remember that?
You called me Joe.
Oh yeah,
Mike,
I got,
you know,</v>

1312
01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:52.620
I can tell by the smell of the Farc what number the dumps going to be.

1313
01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:57.680
And you said it was like a four or five.
Yeah,
I can tell.

1314
01:28:57.740 --> 01:29:01.620
And they had like the other day I have it.
Yes.
They had a three,
three part.

1315
01:29:01.621 --> 01:29:03.330
I noticed I have a three coming.
Okay.

1316
01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:07.710
And sure enough I did about 45 minutes later,
edit three.

1317
01:29:07.890 --> 01:29:12.110
That's really some.
Um,
that's cool man.
Yeah.

1318
01:29:13.490 --> 01:29:14.790
Yeah.
I mean,
you know,

1319
01:29:14.791 --> 01:29:17.790
as you get older you develop certain skills for certain things and it's

1320
01:29:17.791 --> 01:29:19.800
definitely a scary cat.
Yeah.

1321
01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:23.550
<v 7>MMM.
Okay.
Well look,
I uh,
can I give you a call back here in a few minutes?</v>

1322
01:29:23.551 --> 01:29:27.930
Do you mind?
I'll give you a call.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll call you back in a few,

1323
01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:30.320
like,
all right,
I love you.
Bye Bye.
Bye.

1324
01:29:31.330 --> 01:29:34.860
Well we got a definitely a bunch or full report.
Two,

1325
01:29:34.861 --> 01:29:38.250
we got your mom's perspective and your dad's that was bonus for sure.

1326
01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:40.920
That was a bonus material and she was really upset at the question.

1327
01:29:40.921 --> 01:29:45.480
So mission accomplished.
More fun.
Um,
remember the uh,
the,

1328
01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:50.440
the Nelson Mandela hockey player?
Yeah.
Somebody said,
um,
let me see.

1329
01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:51.390
I don't,
I haven't read it yet,

1330
01:29:51.391 --> 01:29:54.360
but this is the email I was listening to your podcasts toward the end.

1331
01:29:54.361 --> 01:29:58.090
I hear a very familiar clip.
The hockey player,
Jonathan.
Uh,

1332
01:29:58.110 --> 01:30:02.640
I think it's Bernay talking about influential Mr Mandela,

1333
01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:06.510
how influential Mr Mandela was to him playing hockey.
I live in Toronto,

1334
01:30:06.511 --> 01:30:09.690
huge maple leafs fan.
So this club hits home for me.

1335
01:30:10.170 --> 01:30:13.350
He got absolutely roasted on Toronto radio for that.

1336
01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:16.170
This guy was supposed to be the savior for the leaves.

1337
01:30:16.171 --> 01:30:20.580
He was a young up and coming goalie that was traded for from your La Kings.

1338
01:30:20.581 --> 01:30:23.820
He had a pretty good first year and a half.
Then it's video happened.

1339
01:30:23.821 --> 01:30:27.360
He was so bad after that.
Like so,
so fucking bad.

1340
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:31.740
He is no longer playing for trial.
He's back in California playing for Anaheim,

1341
01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:33.780
playing really good.
Again.

1342
01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:38.250
I think this actually fucked with his head when he was here.
Wow.
Love the show.

1343
01:30:38.251 --> 01:30:43.251
Mommy's can't wait for both of you to come to do another show in Toronto a lot.

1344
01:30:43.970 --> 01:30:48.390
I live podcasts.
Maybe Canadia would really like that.
Love you.

1345
01:30:48.391 --> 01:30:53.340
Mommy's Nathan.
I do love Toronto.
Toronto's that Shit.
It is wonderful.
Toronto.

1346
01:30:53.430 --> 01:30:57.710
Yeah.
Yeah.
I love,
I like Canada and through the good times.
Not La,

1347
01:30:57.770 --> 01:30:59.610
but it's Canada.
You know what I mean?
Right.

1348
01:30:59.611 --> 01:31:04.470
That's a good way of breaking it down to,
it's not la,
but it is.

1349
01:31:04.471 --> 01:31:09.350
Canada is Canada.
I like Canada.
Is,
uh,
is that,

1350
01:31:10.510 --> 01:31:14.250
well,
you were saying,
but it's something else,
right?

1351
01:31:14.730 --> 01:31:18.570
That is my logic.
Yeah.
Oh,
that's crazy.

1352
01:31:18.810 --> 01:31:22.110
I can see that happening.
I mean,
on the great British baking show,

1353
01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:27.560
you have a bad bake and the judges lean into you and then it gets in your head.

1354
01:31:27.781 --> 01:31:30.810
It's hard to bounce back from that much heat,
you know?
Yeah,
of course.

1355
01:31:30.970 --> 01:31:34.480
It must have been a very embarrassing incident.
You know,
I actually do.

1356
01:31:34.890 --> 01:31:37.730
Did I tell you this is how much I actually empathize with that,
even though I,

1357
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:39.330
you know,
I made fun of him or whatever.
Yeah.

1358
01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:42.480
When that clip started before the show,

1359
01:31:42.481 --> 01:31:47.310
when I was making sure my clips were lined up and he said the first line of

1360
01:31:47.311 --> 01:31:51.810
like,
he was a great player,
I turned it off because of my own embarrassment.

1361
01:31:52.130 --> 01:31:56.490
Yes.
Yeah.
I get that way from fortified,
man.
Well,
you know it,

1362
01:31:56.491 --> 01:32:00.100
it happens.
Do we?
Do I know everything?
No.
Do you know

1363
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:04.390
<v 9>everything in the world?
No.
And then on those moments is red carpet moment.</v>

1364
01:32:04.391 --> 01:32:08.130
Just a microphone in your face and a camera.
And he's not,
he's not a,

1365
01:32:08.170 --> 01:32:11.140
he's not an actor.
He's not a comedian.
He's a hockey player.

1366
01:32:11.141 --> 01:32:15.130
So I always feel like that too,
to make athletes talk on the spot.
Yeah.

1367
01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:18.160
And in those,
you know,
it's a high pressure situation.

1368
01:32:18.710 --> 01:32:22.370
<v 11>I get it.
By the way.
I thought like the cause of my pants were so funny.</v>

1369
01:32:22.371 --> 01:32:24.560
Let's like tropical down.
Sorry.

1370
01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:27.740
<v 22>We got to be looking at another way of dealing with it in have a generic,</v>

1371
01:32:27.741 --> 01:32:30.780
he's in the field for a trick nine as the Spin Echo.

1372
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:34.540
Let's go back to first principles for a moment.
Oh my God.

1373
01:32:34.890 --> 01:32:39.810
Remember that that oscillating transfers may get getting field has the effect of

1374
01:32:39.811 --> 01:32:43.440
causing that nuclear mechanization to move from it's equilibrium position

1375
01:32:43.450 --> 01:32:47.700
reporting along with the magnetic field to being preseason at some particular

1376
01:32:47.701 --> 01:32:52.701
angle five and angle four maximum second is to have that mega [inaudible] lying

1377
01:32:53.671 --> 01:32:54.750
in the transverse plane.

1378
01:32:55.010 --> 01:32:56.900
<v 11>You know what I think about when I watched it like this,</v>

1379
01:32:56.930 --> 01:33:01.340
he likes to fuck this guy fucks day and night.
Also,

1380
01:33:02.210 --> 01:33:07.040
we need,
there's a need for this type of human being on earth.

1381
01:33:07.450 --> 01:33:09.440
Yeah,
and thank God that it just happened.

1382
01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:14.270
Cause I look at it like please fill me with bullets right now.

1383
01:33:15.230 --> 01:33:18.740
But there are people that are like,
this is what,

1384
01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:22.050
<v 9>this is what I live for.
This puts a lead in his pencil.
Oh yeah,</v>

1385
01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:24.810
this guy wakes up and I got,
cause I got a bullet for you right now.

1386
01:33:25.650 --> 01:33:28.290
It's at the tip of my day.
This oscillating thing.

1387
01:33:28.291 --> 01:33:31.290
I'm s I'm just geeked on this bro.
Yeah.

1388
01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:33.690
Thank God for smart people basically is what you're saying.

1389
01:33:33.691 --> 01:33:34.524
That is what I'm saying.

1390
01:33:34.930 --> 01:33:39.400
<v 11>Um,
look,
before we go,
I feel like I'm smart.</v>

1391
01:33:39.730 --> 01:33:43.930
We do owe it to at least the people involved to finish that audio.

1392
01:33:50.730 --> 01:33:51.563
<v 6>No,</v>

1393
01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:04.700
<v 9>it is like sad music.
It is like a,
like a procedural.
You're right.
Yeah.</v>

1394
01:34:04.750 --> 01:34:08.580
Telephone order
in the court of law.

1395
01:34:09.230 --> 01:34:11.340
<v 11>It's the moment where,
um,</v>

1396
01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:14.770
the person that you didn't think was a suspect was putting together the,
uh,

1397
01:34:15.210 --> 01:34:18.110
putting together the evidence and they're like,
then you came back.

1398
01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:21.980
<v 9>No.
Yeah.
You saw that she was still in the house</v>

1399
01:34:23.770 --> 01:34:28.090
<v 6>right
next</v>

1400
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:30.830
to intense.

1401
01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:36.010
It's

1402
01:34:36.010 --> 01:34:40.240
<v 9>kind of a bummer.
It puts a bummer mood on,
which should be fun thing.
Right?</v>

1403
01:34:40.241 --> 01:34:43.420
A light playful romp is now a murder.
I don't know though,

1404
01:34:43.421 --> 01:34:45.670
because it was exchange.
It's very aggressive.

1405
01:34:45.671 --> 01:34:49.300
This sexcapade really,
I mean you here,

1406
01:34:49.301 --> 01:34:52.360
it sounds fun.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1407
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:58.010
Sounds light and consensual a man.
That was kind of

1408
01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:01.880
<v 11>fun.
You're right.
That was fun.
I don't know what I was thinking.
Yeah.</v>

1409
01:35:08.740 --> 01:35:13.210
<v 9>I wish our nanny could hear this.
Sham.
This will be it on this one.</v>

1410
01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:16.210
I have to tell you,
this is very,
you're fainting.

1411
01:35:16.650 --> 01:35:21.610
<v 11>This is why I quit.
No,
don't quit.
Do much about it now.</v>

1412
01:35:23.950 --> 01:35:27.910
<v 9>Uh,
this would devastate her.
Yeah.
Thank God for a soundproof studio.
Huh?</v>

1413
01:35:28.570 --> 01:35:33.400
<v 11>Oh Man.
A lot of these songs,
God,</v>

1414
01:35:33.610 --> 01:35:36.320
I don't know which one you want to hear.
There's so much.

1415
01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:41.130
<v 9>How about not aggressive coming and not shitting?</v>

1416
01:35:41.131 --> 01:35:43.170
Cause we've done enough common shit today.

1417
01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:47.220
<v 11>Okay.
Hmm.
I can't so I shouldn't play.
We both got aids.</v>

1418
01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:52.110
Um,

I think that sounds pretty fun,

1419
01:35:52.710 --> 01:35:56.370
but oh no,
that's,
that's shit.
Double Pipe.
Yeah.
So don't do that.

1420
01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:58.200
Got Any common those don't do that.

1421
01:35:59.790 --> 01:36:02.340
I'm having a hard time now finding a close or this one's called,

1422
01:36:02.341 --> 01:36:07.341
it's a piece of asphalt dude and a Canadian Denim boner is another one.

Okay.
