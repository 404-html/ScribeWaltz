00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.133
Okay.

54
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.700
<v 4>Yeah.
Fort Lauderdale,
Fort Lauderdale's Fart.
Louder.
Dale.
Semen,</v>

55
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.510
whole God and come see.
Come see now.

56
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.730
Right cock and come see no fart.
Louder Day.

57
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.760
I think that was one of the first cities we started to make fun.

58
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:46.090
I know because that was like such a hard cock.
Come see.
No,

59
00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:50.220
it was just right there.
The hard cock casino.
It was right there.
Uh,

60
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.880
those reporters were super attractive.
It's south Florida.
Is that,

61
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:58.630
was that why?
Yeah,
of course.
Miami adjacent.
Yeah,
that's,
yeah,

62
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.310
it's attractive people of course.
Seriously.
Miami,
Miami,
La Jude.
Titties.

63
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.930
Good looking people on the news especially.
Yeah.
And this is the,
the Latin vibes.

64
00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:09.960
So they gotta be sexy.
I mean,
you,

65
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.690
you've never seen a female anchor that looks like a rock,

66
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.390
right?
No pigs allowed.
No,
no,
not in Fort Lauderdale.

67
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.030
And the weather girls usually have like the cut on down there.

68
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.800
Why is that Tom?
Uh,
I think the Latins demanded.
Why

69
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.810
not say hey,
sexy?
No.
Why?
Why?

70
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:36.310
What is it with the Latins and the sexy?
What is that?
Miami sex culture is crazy.

71
00:05:36.311 --> 00:05:39.210
I remember talking to guys now who,
you know,

72
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.060
are adults now about middle school and they're like,
yeah,

73
00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:46.750
we were fucking in in fifth grade.
And my favorite,
by the way,

74
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.450
are you talking about who was fucking in hell?

75
00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:53.020
The kids pacifically who pacifically kids kind of children.

76
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.080
What do you mean?
Like who all the kids are?
That's what he was,

77
00:05:57.081 --> 00:06:01.400
he was saying that one of my friends was saying that,
that you'd be made fun of,

78
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.380
you know,
like that's what you'd be teased about.
Like,
Oh,

79
00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:07.190
you haven't been fucking yet.
It was like 10,
11 years old,

80
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.270
I think.
But you know,
you see the footage from carnival in Brazil,
you know,

81
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.200
titties out,
ass out.
It's also,
it's less thought of as taboo,

82
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.840
you know,
it's not,
they're just like,
oh yeah,
people have sex.

83
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.640
I think it's a little hyper.
Uh,
yeah,
but still they're,

84
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:30.070
they're not making it this dangerous,
but the very thing,
the irony is,

85
00:06:30.071 --> 00:06:33.380
is that they're deeply Catholic.
So then you have,
that is ironic,

86
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.390
this weird juxtaposition of like hypersexual and then hyper cath lab and they

87
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:41.270
loved their mothers.
It's a very maternal cultural,
it's like,

88
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:43.880
do you want to fuck or do you want to fucking feel guilty?

89
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.060
Or do you want to fuck your mom?
Fuck your mom.
Um,

90
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.460
remember when we were in Puerto Rico,

91
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.620
my holy grail and I felt like I was visiting the Wailing Wall,

92
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:55.101
you know what I mean?

93
00:06:55.101 --> 00:06:59.420
For me it was just that personnel to to finally go to Puerto Rico.
Of course,

94
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:00.500
remember the towels,

95
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.970
they would sell beach towels that were just like naked boners just naked people

96
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.310
aren't like painted.
Oh,
sexual.
Yeah.

97
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:15.620
How's that man who's around,
who's Yo know smells like

98
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.300
sexual,
not sexual,
not sexual,
not sexual guys.

99
00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:27.920
It's just pile a bunch of guys just hanging out,
just hanging,
being real,

100
00:07:27.921 --> 00:07:31.000
being guys.
That's so funny.
See,
I'll see.

101
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:35.060
Eastern blockers were pretty sexual too,
but we keep it,
no,

102
00:07:35.061 --> 00:07:36.950
like they make out in public like the kids.

103
00:07:36.951 --> 00:07:38.720
So that's because everyone lives with their parents.

104
00:07:38.721 --> 00:07:43.170
I remember semester abroad and Spain was um,

105
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.910
a lot.
You saw a lot.
I mean I was in Madrid lot of middle,

106
00:07:46.911 --> 00:07:50.900
like a public teenage may counts a lot like you would,
it was,

107
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.410
it was overwhelming.
But oddly enough,
like when I was in Peru,

108
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.480
which is South America,
Latin culture,
very Catholic,
they were much more,

109
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.280
I think they were obviously doing things,
but um,

110
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:08.320
it wasn't a public thing you put on a public face of a little more reserved

111
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:12.110
decorum.
Yeah.
Yeah man.
Yo,
come on,
hold it together.
A pig.

112
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.320
But I mean that's Peru and then right over here in Brazil and it's totally

113
00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:18.470
different cities.
They just fucking,
the streets in Brazil,
right?

114
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.060
I don't know if they fucking the streets,

115
00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:22.400
but they definitely get their asses out.
They let their asses out,

116
00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:24.260
enter titties out everywhere.
Dude.

117
00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:28.340
You go to south beach and you see those titties everywhere.
Yeah,
that's right.

118
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:33.290
All kinds of teddy.
Just like the gays.
But I like that culture.

119
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:38.240
I feel comfortable in that.
I feel totally comfortable around all Latin cultures.

120
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.880
Very familiar.
I like it.
I like it too.
I,
you know,

121
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.620
my own tribe makes me a little uncomfortable by the way.
Same to me.

122
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.470
Eastern buggers.
It's all about making you feel not welcome.

123
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.800
I feel like uncomfortable.
It's just harder.
Their heart more hardcore.

124
00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:00.480
Also this whole thing about showing emotion is bad.
See,
it's one thing,
weakness,

125
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.970
overly emotional thing can be overwhelming,

126
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.740
like overly emotional people and you're like cool.

127
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.830
But the one thing that's nice is you always know where someone's standing.

128
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:12.470
You know what I mean?
Like you're not guessing when you read someone.
Yeah.

129
00:09:12.471 --> 00:09:16.620
So like with,
with what's common among like the Latin people is like,

130
00:09:16.621 --> 00:09:19.290
you know when they're upset,
you know when they're happy,

131
00:09:19.291 --> 00:09:20.520
you know when they like something,

132
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:25.020
you know when they're excited and then that's this coldness thing where you go

133
00:09:25.021 --> 00:09:28.410
like,
does the person not like me or does the person upset?
And they're like,
no,

134
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.840
that's just normal.
But that's,

135
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.500
that takes a lot of getting used to because they're not giving you a clear

136
00:09:34.501 --> 00:09:36.570
signal.
Yeah.
See I actually,

137
00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:41.571
I view it the opposite because in Latin culture sometimes they're so polite that

138
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.410
they don't tell you like from me,

139
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:46.140
I have to be hit over the head because I grew up that way.

140
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.950
They just tell you like you're fucking piece of shit and you,

141
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.280
that's how you communicate.

142
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.400
I'm actually used to a more over the head form of communication.

143
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.560
Like we were talking today,
like our nannies,

144
00:09:55.561 --> 00:10:00.330
very Latin and demean like she doesn't come out.
Sometimes we have to kind of be,

145
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:05.310
she can't hide it.
She does.
She'll,
she's very,

146
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.520
she will satisfy you,

147
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.590
but she will not 100% hide how she feels.
So if you go,

148
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.550
if you go,
do you mind staying later today?
She'll go,
sure.

149
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.290
It's so obvious at that point that she doesn't want it to,
so you go,

150
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:26.290
do you have plans after?
Well,
okay,

151
00:10:26.291 --> 00:10:29.070
so then do that.
Don't worry.
Like I could adjust my thing.

152
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:33.930
You don't have to stay late.
Oh,
she's so sweet.
But he wouldn't go like,

153
00:10:33.931 --> 00:10:38.100
no,
I have something to do and my family a big go fuck yourself.

154
00:10:38.101 --> 00:10:40.860
I have to do something that you're,
you're intruding in my life.

155
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.890
You're ruining my life.
Uh,
she's so sweet.

156
00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.400
We have a housekeeper that we've had for years too.
She's from,

157
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:52.430
she's Cuban and last week she was here cleaning and there's been an evolution in

158
00:10:53.161 --> 00:10:54.750
her phone game.
Yeah.

159
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.700
Like at first it was like occasionally she'd be on her phone cleaning the house,

160
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:04.110
taking calls.
Cause you're like,
oh yeah,
you're,
you're doing like busy.

161
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.080
Why you don't need to think a whole,
you know,
it's,
it's busy work essentially.

162
00:11:07.081 --> 00:11:09.150
Like you have to think but not,
it's not focused.

163
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:14.100
And then it evolved to like the Bluetooth,
right?
Like was there a oh no,
no,

164
00:11:14.101 --> 00:11:15.340
she would use the air piece.

165
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.800
It's the earpiece evolved to like if I walked in the room,

166
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.830
I'd never say anything.
If I walked in the room,
which was on the phone,

167
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.170
I would hear her in Spanish obviously say like,

168
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:30.030
oh I got go it when the implication was the,
you know,
the my employer.

169
00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:34.560
Right.
So I'm going to end this nonsense right now.
Now

170
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:41.020
if I walk in the room and she's on the phone,
she'll be like,
yeah,

171
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:47.960
I talk louder.
Like this guy fucking here.
But anyways,

172
00:11:47.961 --> 00:11:48.781
so if later on,

173
00:11:48.781 --> 00:11:52.860
if you guys want to get together and like come completely disregarding,

174
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.070
find it highly

175
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.640
<v 3>amusing.
So do I have no,
actually I know she does a great job.</v>

176
00:11:57.641 --> 00:12:01.120
It doesn't interfere with the work.
She gets to talk to her friends.
Why not?
Uh,

177
00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:02.560
but now it's evolved to,

178
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.040
she just puts them on speaker phone and then puts the phone on the counter.

179
00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:10.020
So now we hear both sides of the conversation in Spanish,
which is fine too.
It,

180
00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:13.420
it is funny though because she'll be like,
wait,
who's talking?
Oh,
it's,

181
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:14.501
it's our cleaning lady.

182
00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:17.190
She's on the phone with somebody again and she's always like,

183
00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.860
<v 5>I know</v>

184
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.270
<v 3>that was always her with ing bank.</v>

185
00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.130
<v 5>I know</v>

186
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.800
<v 3>better.
Better why she did this.
She say that alone.
Yeah.</v>

187
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:31.590
They have a really interesting accent.
Cubans.
I like how she'd speak Spanish.

188
00:12:31.591 --> 00:12:36.080
It's cool.
I heard her one time,
uh,
[inaudible] speak Spanish.
You here?

189
00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:36.973
Um,

190
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:42.180
nanny speaks Spanish and here my most expanse and you have those say specific

191
00:12:42.181 --> 00:12:46.290
sentences,
you will hear it just like you're hearing an American,

192
00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:51.170
a Brit and like a Scottish person.
That's crazy.
Yeah.
That's tall dialect.

193
00:12:51.171 --> 00:12:53.940
Wholly different.
But they understand each other.
It's the same language,

194
00:12:53.941 --> 00:12:58.140
but their accents and their slang is 100% different,
right?
Yeah.

195
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:02.440
Just like America,
just like,
just like the case.
It's just like the gays.
Yeah.
Um,

196
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.450
I was,
I gonna say now I remember.
Thanks.
Well,
how about this?

197
00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:11.070
We have kind of a celebratory thing going on right now.

198
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.170
You shot your first special,

199
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:17.910
now I'm so exhausted and I'm so happy and I'm so grateful we didn't tell
anybody.

200
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:21.570
But you came,
I came up there and you opened for me.
I know.

201
00:13:21.571 --> 00:13:25.170
That was so fun and it was the best surprise ever to the audience and they

202
00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:27.910
freaked out and people really seem to enjoy that.
Yeah.

203
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.680
The jeans were one pair and I'm so glad you came with me,
Jean.

204
00:13:31.681 --> 00:13:33.650
I'm so thankful because I mean,

205
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.040
I was always planning on going with for months and you know,

206
00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.110
just going to be your support and you know,

207
00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.960
just make sure everything's going well and you have what you need.

208
00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:47.610
And then a few weeks ago you were just like,
I think he was you.
You said like,

209
00:13:47.611 --> 00:13:50.970
would you open?
And I was like,
yeah,
of course.
It's never occurred to me,

210
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:55.680
think about it,
who,
you know,
offer it or anything.
But they ended up being very,

211
00:13:55.681 --> 00:13:56.430
really fun.
Yeah.

212
00:13:56.430 --> 00:14:00.390
It was Super Fun and I'm so glad you were there just so that I didn't freak out

213
00:14:00.391 --> 00:14:04.560
day of the guy.
I didn't freak out.
I freaked out three months ago,

214
00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.590
you know when you know like,
Oh shit,
there's a,
there's a date now.

215
00:14:07.591 --> 00:14:09.840
Like there's a fucking thing and then day of,
Oh,

216
00:14:09.841 --> 00:14:11.640
I could sleep the night before I was fine,

217
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:14.850
but then I felt myself around 2:00 PM yeah.
Getting into hair and makeup.

218
00:14:14.851 --> 00:14:17.540
That's when like the terrorist started to kick.
Yeah.

219
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:21.540
I was glad you were there just to have somebody I to talk to that spoke my

220
00:14:21.541 --> 00:14:25.860
language also got like such an interesting perspective because it was the first

221
00:14:25.861 --> 00:14:27.570
time that I was really close to someone,

222
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.710
but I'm not the one doing it where you're seeing the day evolve,

223
00:14:31.711 --> 00:14:36.060
but you don't feel the pressure of doing the show.
Right.

224
00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:39.630
The pressure on you,
it's all for you.
And that's the Friday.
And then I know,

225
00:14:39.631 --> 00:14:43.540
I understand why the managers and the producers are like,
screw it.

226
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.530
Just do your thing.
Because that's exactly what it felt like.
Yeah.
Big Deal.

227
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.930
Just when we walked over there,
I was like,
beautiful day.

228
00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.780
Then you looks great just to your fucking show.
What's your problem?
Yeah.

229
00:14:51.781 --> 00:14:54.270
That's not that big of a deal.
And go down.
What's your problem?
Right?

230
00:14:54.271 --> 00:14:57.260
You pick your Pronoun,
get out there and be Pauline by.
Yeah.
And the thing is,

231
00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.300
it really isn't.
And the,
at the end of the day,

232
00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:02.960
because we've done it for so many years and once,
once I got up there,

233
00:15:02.961 --> 00:15:06.750
it was like,
oh,
this is my second home,
but a pronoun.

234
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.760
But the it,
it's,

235
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:12.860
it's a little overwhelming when you walk in and there's this whole thing and

236
00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:17.240
then it's all for you.
There's many cameras,
there's screens,

237
00:15:17.241 --> 00:15:21.860
there's producers,
there's people talking to you person,
crew and yeah.
Yeah.

238
00:15:21.861 --> 00:15:24.350
It is not a,
this is not your friend being like,
Hey,

239
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:26.540
are you free this afternoon to do this thing?
Yeah.

240
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:30.920
It's a lot of money and a lot of people's livelihoods essentially.

241
00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:34.630
Here's the thing that's so crazy that the reason that there is very,

242
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:35.743
and the reason why you all

243
00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:39.350
<v 0>always have some form of anxiety on a shoot days.</v>

244
00:15:39.351 --> 00:15:42.920
You just never know how it's going to go.
Yeah.
And then afterwards,

245
00:15:42.921 --> 00:15:46.340
like luckily for you,
I can tell you that like,
man,

246
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.910
it's got to feel good because it went so well,
was amazing and you know,
you like,

247
00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.600
and you know it's captured,
you know,
it's like when you shoot these things,
you,

248
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:59.120
you could be on tour.
I'll tell you,
the first one I did was in Minneapolis.

249
00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:02.660
I'm sorry,
where?
Minneapolis tits.
Okay.

250
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:07.310
And I know people will say,
you know,
oh,

251
00:16:07.311 --> 00:16:09.950
are you trying to be dramatic?
I promise you this,

252
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:15.490
of the hundred and 50 shows leading up to that taping in Minneapolis,

253
00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.850
that was the worst show of the hundred and fifth

254
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.900
<v 3>taping day was the worst show of this,
of all the shows leading up to it.
No,</v>

255
00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:29.170
I swear to God like the audience was just shit.
Yes.
God Damn it.
Yes.

256
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.650
It was terrible.
And this is completely normal.
Yes.
Oh my God.

257
00:16:32.651 --> 00:16:34.120
Which ended up being like,
oh,

258
00:16:34.121 --> 00:16:37.770
ended up best help special that everyone loves and red.

259
00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.220
But that's so fun.

260
00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:43.650
<v 0>Lesson for that for me was that was because it was well received by,</v>

261
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.690
by some people you know,
at home.
Yeah.

262
00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.260
You realize that even with what I experienced,

263
00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:52.890
ultimately you're performing for the people at home.
Yes.
It's television.

264
00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:57.420
There were jokes that fell so flat that I was used to getting such a big laugh

265
00:16:57.421 --> 00:17:00.330
on there was,
it was just like,
it was one of those things where you're like,

266
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:04.950
you know,
I,
you know,
I,
I was like,
well,
and this is just what it is.
And Dan is,

267
00:17:04.951 --> 00:17:06.200
yeah.
But,
but yeah,

268
00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.940
<v 3>killing his girlfriend continues today and so far no rolling on.</v>

269
00:17:11.941 --> 00:17:15.130
If we'll be able to show his penis.
I like,

270
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.480
I'd kind of glad that we got to see like call those Suarez has been following

271
00:17:18.481 --> 00:17:21.570
this Carlos Torres.
That's a Latin name.
Yup.

272
00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:25.360
<v 0>But I wanted to say that ultimately,
you know,
you have the,
the,</v>

273
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.780
the best part of it,
which is that people are going to enjoy it at home,

274
00:17:27.781 --> 00:17:29.940
but people in the audience loved it.

275
00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:34.210
<v 3>Yeah.
It was,
it was fine.
It was really,
and it was a really,
I was there,</v>

276
00:17:34.211 --> 00:17:38.170
I was really,
here's the thing,
it took me 14 years to get here.
Amazing.

277
00:17:38.171 --> 00:17:42.520
And I'm kind of glad it took that long because I think had I done this,

278
00:17:42.521 --> 00:17:43.600
we were just talking about this this morning.

279
00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.870
Had I done this even five years ago,
three years ago,

280
00:17:46.871 --> 00:17:51.180
I would have been shitting in my pants.
Yeah.
So think it took like it took,

281
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:53.610
it took longer and I'm glad it did.

282
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:57.180
I'm thankful for it because it gave me the time to calm the fuck down and just

283
00:17:57.181 --> 00:17:58.830
like enjoy him and enjoy the day.

284
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:03.330
I was actually more sad about about it being over,
you know,
and you're like,
oh,

285
00:18:03.331 --> 00:18:07.410
now I don't have that thing to look forward to anymore.
Like that's kind of gone.

286
00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:11.870
I'll tell you guys,
one funny thing that happened during the taping.
So,
uh,

287
00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:15.150
halfway through the first show,
you know,
the,
they get out and they tell you guys,

288
00:18:15.151 --> 00:18:17.360
hey,
don't,
don't get up and take a piss.

289
00:18:17.361 --> 00:18:20.600
Don't pay your fallen out because we're taping and it interferes with the camera

290
00:18:20.601 --> 00:18:25.480
as blah,
blah,
blah.
So halfway through my set and maybe less a quarter away,
I hear

291
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:32.750
some nasty motherfucker got up and was flushing the toilet and you can hear it

292
00:18:33.841 --> 00:18:36.060
in the showroom and I was like,
I got to hold for sound.

293
00:18:36.061 --> 00:18:38.610
Like I can't just tell my joke through toilet flushing.

294
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.840
Then it ended up being like this crazy moment and I'm like,

295
00:18:42.841 --> 00:18:46.020
who is shitting in the middle of my shoe?
So funny.

296
00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:51.150
And flushing and flushing and flushing like it was so perfect for your mom's

297
00:18:51.151 --> 00:18:54.720
house essentially for people to be there and someone taking a shit in my show,

298
00:18:54.721 --> 00:18:59.630
like doing asshole.
There's two ways things can go in a show.

299
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:04.640
Something happens and your instinct can be to get upset.
This is right.
Right,

300
00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:08.880
right,
right.
Roll with that.
Thank you.
And um,

301
00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.590
it'll be interesting to see whether you keep it in,

302
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.450
I don't know if I will and you'll see it in the,

303
00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:15.620
in the line cut and you'll see whether or not you want it in.

304
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:20.160
But it was in to experience it from where I was and to see you keep going with

305
00:19:20.161 --> 00:19:22.350
it was really funny.
Well,
I don't know if you know this.
I mean,

306
00:19:22.351 --> 00:19:26.730
I don't mean to be talking to an attorney or,
but I am the queen of Improv.

307
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:31.770
Oh yeah.
I don't mind you saying it.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's really,
you were very,

308
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.990
your improv skills were really good there.
Well,
I'm really,
um,

309
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.000
I'm really thankful to have you there on the best part of it seriously was

310
00:19:39.001 --> 00:19:40.200
having you there and,

311
00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.260
and knowing that the mommy's wearing in the audience supporting me and laughing

312
00:19:43.261 --> 00:19:46.230
and that was so special.
I think it's always special when it's you,

313
00:19:46.231 --> 00:19:49.830
me and the mommies.
I just love it.
It was,
I really do love it.
We really had,

314
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:55.140
it really was a fun,
fun night.
Special.
Very special.
My cousin Julie came down.

315
00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:00.240
She and her husband live in Washington now,
so it's good to see her too,

316
00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:04.770
and you know.
Yeah,
it was special.
Very cool.
I look gray.
I love my outfit.

317
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.810
My jeans were high,
super tight.

318
00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:10.260
Are you going to wear jeans on your next tape course?
I've always worn jeans.

319
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:12.960
I wear jeans under my,
under the dress that I wear.

320
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:14.660
Do you want to go back to this news thing?
Right.

321
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.780
I would love to go back to this new thing.
Obviously you just,

322
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.930
you heard the clip of the jury or they haven't decided whether the defendant can

323
00:20:21.931 --> 00:20:23.880
show his penis to the jury.
Yeah.

324
00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.750
<v 6>The associate medical examiner,
Broward County,</v>

325
00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:30.540
took to the sand about an hour ago and said that in all his years of work,

326
00:20:30.541 --> 00:20:35.160
he has never had a single case where someone choked to death as a result of

327
00:20:35.161 --> 00:20:36.570
performing oral sex.

328
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:39.290
<v 3>So,
uh,
oh.</v>

329
00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:43.820
<v 6>His testimony goes to the heart of the defense's case that Richard Patterson did</v>

330
00:20:43.821 --> 00:20:48.821
not kill his girlfriend back in 2015 prosecutors allege that these 65 year old

331
00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:52.810
choked to death,
but he claims that she choked on his penis.

332
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.900
The Emmy told jurors a penis would have to be large,

333
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:59.950
far enough down a person's throat to block that person from breathing through

334
00:20:59.951 --> 00:21:01.600
their nose and a mouth.

335
00:21:01.601 --> 00:21:05.590
He also said that it would take two to three minutes for a person to die as a

336
00:21:05.591 --> 00:21:09.360
result of a lack of oxygen so that it would have been back here.
That person,

337
00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:12.160
this woman in distress

338
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:16.370
<v 4>to show the jury his penis how big it is.
Yeah.
You could choke on this.</v>

339
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:19.520
You know,
here's the medical examiner

340
00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.990
<v 7>and if she can win,
she's usually start.</v>

341
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.420
<v 4>Well,
speaking of that,
yeah.
Yes.
My tribe</v>

342
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:31.210
<v 7>Z is blocking off the airway,
opens his airways.</v>

343
00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:33.700
It's normal reaction in the first one.

344
00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:38.320
<v 4>So he's saying she should be flailing and biding and you know,</v>

345
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:40.690
flipping out because she can't breathe.
Right.
I mean,
here's the thing,

346
00:21:40.691 --> 00:21:44.260
as someone that has done this before,
done what?
Nothing.

347
00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:48.750
I kissed PBS before so many before you got that.
Uh,

348
00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:53.530
you kind of know when you can't breathe,
so why wouldn't you just put your mouth,

349
00:21:53.531 --> 00:21:55.510
get your mouth away from it?
So he must have choked her.

350
00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:57.550
He was probably pushing her head down.

351
00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.580
<v 8>My ass.
My ass.
Yeah.</v>

352
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:04.790
<v 4>It's my friend Rocco.
Yup.</v>

353
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.691
<v 6>All right.</v>

354
00:22:05.691 --> 00:22:10.220
Now the defense has asked a judge whether Patterson can show jurors his penis as

355
00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:15.170
part of their case is not Sam on whether that will be allowed to take place.

356
00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:19.910
Medical Examiner also told jurors that he could not rule on a matter of death

357
00:22:19.911 --> 00:22:24.800
because the body of 60 year old Francisco Martinez was in such bad shape when it

358
00:22:24.801 --> 00:22:26.890
was found inside her morgate home.
Yeah.

359
00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:31.570
<v 4>Whoa.
That means what though?
That it sat around for a long time in bad shape.</v>

360
00:22:31.571 --> 00:22:35.590
I don't know.
She's hot though,
right?
The judge there.
Now,
for our listeners,

361
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:40.080
could you describe the defendant?
I mean,
they don't know they're there.
Yeah,

362
00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:45.160
he's a old ass dad.
I mean,
he's got red skin,

363
00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:48.640
all white hair,
white hair like Santa's without a beard.
Yeah.

364
00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:52.140
I mean you wouldn't even expect this guy has a dick anymore.
Yeah.
No.

365
00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:55.030
Or that it gets hard then it gets big enough to choke people.
Yeah.

366
00:22:55.031 --> 00:23:00.031
I doubt that he's real old is similar to the premise of a tod Sha,

367
00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.650
Aka two short song blowjob,
Betty.
Right.

368
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:07.090
And was she bust a nut and killed a bitch.
But that's from the nut.

369
00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:08.800
I know that's why there's a distinction,

370
00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:14.380
but it is similar in the premise where they both their dicks both were involved

371
00:23:14.381 --> 00:23:16.690
in murder.
That's interesting.
What a neat point.

372
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.880
I wish you would bring that up to the judge.
Yup.

373
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:23.950
<v 6>The medical examiner is still on the stand and the defense says that spelled did</v>

374
00:23:23.951 --> 00:23:28.570
not call nine one one the night that this happened because he was embarrassed

375
00:23:28.571 --> 00:23:29.530
about the whole thing.

376
00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.630
<v 4>So just whenever you want to know something,
why not guilty?</v>

377
00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:39.270
He was found not guilty.
Seriously.
Yeah.
Not guilty.
I think he choked her.
I do.

378
00:23:39.271 --> 00:23:41.230
I do to on accident and was super big PP.

379
00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:46.730
How could you choke yourself on someone's Dick?
That's stupid.
He killed her.
Yup.

380
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:51.740
They should rethink that shit.
What the fuck?
How old is this guy?

381
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:56.570
He was 65 at the time,
so now he's 67 well he nasty house.
No nasty.

382
00:23:56.571 --> 00:23:59.820
Where your big o you big old,
Stinky Dick.
You know,

383
00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:02.120
I found this to finally pulled from,

384
00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:05.250
from the episode my parents were on target.

385
00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.850
I might be retired.
I go retarded.

386
00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.640
I go retarded.
Retarded.

387
00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:23.540
That's interesting.
In already picked retarded.

388
00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.870
I didn't realize how popular a choice that would be.
Personally.

389
00:24:29.871 --> 00:24:32.780
I would take the sexual abuse from my Granddad,
but you know,

390
00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.090
cause then you can just go to therapy and deal with that.

391
00:24:35.091 --> 00:24:37.610
But you can't treat retarded.
You can't really treat it.

392
00:24:37.611 --> 00:24:41.180
But some people really hate the other option,
I guess.
Yes.

393
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:44.100
I mean from my dad it was just Asian food.
All right.

394
00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.720
Let me think about how much you have to,
I hate that.

395
00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.190
I love Korean barbecue and I love Sushi.
I can't even imagine.

396
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.640
I mean obviously I would just be like Asian food forever.
Of course.
All Day,

397
00:24:55.641 --> 00:24:58.670
every day.
I love Asian.
That's one of my favorite cuisines of the world.

398
00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.840
What could you eat every day?
I know steak.

399
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:08.630
I do love meat.
I could eat that a lot.

400
00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:13.160
You had Sushi the other day and it gave me diarrhea.
You don't learn,

401
00:25:13.161 --> 00:25:16.040
I don't think no more.
You just keep eating it in the bear.

402
00:25:16.041 --> 00:25:20.660
Keeps eating and shitting everywhere.
I just,
you know,
it was fun

403
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.780
cause I ain't afraid of him.
You know what's so funny?

404
00:25:26.781 --> 00:25:31.730
Yesterday we flew home on virgin.
Yeah.
And uh,
are,
are fried.

405
00:25:31.731 --> 00:25:35.390
Attended.
Her name was Debbie.
Yeah.
It was so stupid.
We were like,

406
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:39.590
you were you making whatever.
She's really nice though.
It was nice,

407
00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:44.210
by the way,
the driver to the airport and he was flying to Virginia Airlines.

408
00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:49.910
I go virgin.
He goes,
okay,
why don't you do this drive all the time?

409
00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.990
Because the airport,
who's flying Virginia Air Weirdo that he clearly,

410
00:25:53.991 --> 00:25:56.360
it wasn't like a little slip up.
He goes,
Virginia air today,

411
00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:02.260
that many deaf people fly to Virginia from here.
So weird.
Yeah.

412
00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:05.060
So she was Debbie and I was like,
Hey,
uh,

413
00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:10.610
you're see that movie Debbie Does Dallas?
And she goes,
no.
I go,

414
00:26:10.611 --> 00:26:11.900
you know,
it's about,

415
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:19.130
are you going to do everybody on the plane?
She was like,
yeah,
I think so.

416
00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.560
Let me go,
where are you going to start in front of their back?

417
00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.720
They're going to start at the back.
I guess.
That's quite a job.
Yeah.

418
00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:28.130
Could you imagine if that was apologize?
When we land she goes,
I'm sorry.

419
00:26:28.131 --> 00:26:32.540
I didn't get to do everybody.
Just trying to everyone,
but I couldn't,

420
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:37.430
that's a tear.
Okay.
So what of that's your job?
Maybe that's a good,

421
00:26:37.431 --> 00:26:42.410
would you rather ooh.
Oh,
does that mean nasty at all?
Be Nasty.
It's all,

422
00:26:42.411 --> 00:26:46.290
but it really is all mental.
It's can you remove yourself?
Yeah.

423
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:51.760
Yeah,
it's,
can you remove yourself from the horror of doing all of these people?

424
00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.900
Or can you like separate yourself?
Like you're,
you know,

425
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.510
think of yourself like a kidnap victim or something.
You know?

426
00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:03.780
Would you rather be Debbie,
the flight attendant who has to do the entire plane,

427
00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.450
who or Saigon,
that old guy's weaning

428
00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:10.200
weight and potentially die?

429
00:27:10.201 --> 00:27:14.670
Or can I back off if I'm choking that the potential for death is there,
is there,

430
00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:18.300
but you got to just suck it once for,
here's the thing.
People are saying,
Oh,

431
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:20.460
do I know they're going,
dude.
Obviously it'd be her.

432
00:27:20.461 --> 00:27:21.870
You don't have to suck that guy's Dick.

433
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:27.000
But on the plane there might be 80 guys say 80 dicks.
Yeah.

434
00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:31.490
It's like the old guys did
for sure.
I was like,

435
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.070
that'll guy's dick too.
Over doing the whole plane.
You know how many nasty,

436
00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.200
ugly people
he might kill him now.

437
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:43.160
Don't buy that.
I would know when I was choking and then I shot,

438
00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:47.070
probably didn't do and he probably held on and that's how she died.
He's too old.

439
00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:52.440
Fuck him.
Could you imagine blowing just a random plane of people?
You might,

440
00:27:52.441 --> 00:27:56.760
any gross people are on airplanes.
There was fat ones,
skinny ones,

441
00:27:56.761 --> 00:28:01.020
greasy ones,
smelling ones.
I was on a plane last week where,
um,

442
00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:06.270
uh,
this kid was taking a shit and first class we've,
we reveal later.

443
00:28:06.271 --> 00:28:09.810
It was a teenage boy and anyway,
the guy was in there for 20 minutes.

444
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.650
The flight attendant was knocking on,
knocking on the door.
I finally,
he gets out.

445
00:28:13.651 --> 00:28:15.690
It's a teenage Asian kidneys fat.

446
00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:20.460
Took a big shit and it stinks so bad that the guy in front of me refused to go

447
00:28:20.461 --> 00:28:23.790
in and take a piss.
I was like,
you got to Kenny.
And then this hiccup,

448
00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.260
this hippie kid pushed his way in front of me and I let him go in and he's like,

449
00:28:28.261 --> 00:28:30.570
what?
What's going on?
Why is everybody standing around?
And I'm like,

450
00:28:30.571 --> 00:28:33.720
do I let me go?
You'll find out.
And then he's like,
I see why now.

451
00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:37.350
Mrs Smelled Terrible,
smelled horrendous time.

452
00:28:37.351 --> 00:28:41.640
I got on a plane and a dude,
shit came out.

453
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.370
Nancy stuck inside of that toilet.

454
00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:49.440
So I hit flush and the water just went over it.
It smelled so bad.

455
00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.200
And I told the flight attendant,
she goes,
oh,
I got some.

456
00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:56.340
And She just had a person spray in her purse and just did like 20 sprays in

457
00:28:56.341 --> 00:29:00.780
there.
And I was like,
man,
it's like an hell.
It's just putting perfume on.

458
00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:05.750
That shit is all you're doing.
You know,
it's not good.
It's so gnarly.
Um,
yeah.

459
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:10.200
Here we go.
Email you to talk about

460
00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.920
hair removal between the cheeks and have discussed waxing.

461
00:29:14.921 --> 00:29:19.100
And I'm here to tell you a much easier and less invasive method to remove all

462
00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.510
that Brown collecting for Nair.

463
00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:24.840
Good old fashioned glass.

464
00:29:24.841 --> 00:29:29.400
That shit on up in your cheeks while minding the more sensitive skin that is the

465
00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:32.610
ball.
SACRA vulva within a couple minutes,

466
00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:35.790
wipe it off with a wash cloth,
washcloth in the shower.

467
00:29:35.791 --> 00:29:40.380
It gets into every book and Brown cranny and webs away the hair without having

468
00:29:40.381 --> 00:29:43.360
to be humiliated by having an actual person wax your asshole.

469
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:47.140
I have much experience with this and no bad reactions.

470
00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:51.850
I hope this has provided you with a much needed solution to main mother Tina's

471
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:56.500
version,
Aka excuse to not devouring your asshole.
Tommy.

472
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:59.680
Love you both.
And Christina is the life champ.

473
00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.910
<v 3>I like that life change.
That's Caroline.
That's a lady right there.</v>

474
00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.590
Caroline and Caroline.
I am,

475
00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:10.750
I've used near on my legs and it is a very volatile chemical substance.
Yeah.

476
00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:14.110
It smells really bad and strong.
So she's right.

477
00:30:14.111 --> 00:30:17.620
You gotta be real careful about it touching your,
your kibbles and bits.

478
00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:21.270
So if you put on your ass hole,
I mean,
I don't know how she does it.
She,

479
00:30:21.271 --> 00:30:24.150
she must have a lot of experience because that,
that is true.
I'll try it.

480
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:29.110
It really will burn you gotta be careful if you get it on your tender tender

481
00:30:29.111 --> 00:30:32.470
zones.
Yeah.
Alright.
Yeah,
it's real.
It's hold them up for a little bit.

482
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:35.050
How long have you leave it on for a couple minutes.
Yeah.

483
00:30:35.051 --> 00:30:38.940
It's quite near like burns the hair off.
That's I think how it works.

484
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:41.700
Like a chemical burn.
I'm going to try it.
It's pretty gnarly.
Hey,

485
00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.650
you got to get your teeth whitened before.
I know you do your stuff.

486
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:48.000
People keep telling me online they're commenting and how yellow your teeth?

487
00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:49.940
<v 4>No,
you gotta get your teeth whitened.
You do.</v>

488
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:55.360
Especially if we're going to shoot something.
Here we go.
Oh,

489
00:30:56.070 --> 00:31:00.510
this guy,
when he worked at Ballpark,
they made us do a chant in our meetings.

490
00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:05.320
Oh my God.
We had those last week and they were just ball for our Walmart.

491
00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:06.173
Yeah.

492
00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:10.940
<v 3>God.
Shabu shabu you think about,</v>

493
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:14.240
you know it's Shibuya was so horrible that I think about it.
Yeah.

494
00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:16.280
Every now and then I'll be like in our closet

495
00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:20.980
<v 9>and I'll think about those poor people.
God,</v>

496
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:25.410
Oh my God.
So bad,

497
00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:36.480
right?
We are.
We are Walmart.

498
00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:40.740
We are.
We are.

499
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:45.350
<v 4>I know.
Especially for like,
you know,
it's not a job that you love.
No,</v>

500
00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:49.490
nobody's like a career Walmart employee.
It's a stepping stone place.

501
00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:52.900
He said that when they were,
I mean,
it's a sales level,

502
00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.060
not I'm in management stuff.

503
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:57.350
This took place in the middle of the store in front of customers.

504
00:31:57.351 --> 00:32:01.970
I went like this,
give me a w gimme,
a gimme,

505
00:32:01.971 --> 00:32:06.050
an l o,
and he said squiggly.
We had to go up and down,
shaking our butts.

506
00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:11.120
Gimme an m m gimme an A.
Hey,
give me an or give me a t.

507
00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:15.290
Hey,
what's that spell Walmart.
I can't hear you.
What do we want?

508
00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:19.010
Save people money.
How do we do it so they can live better?

509
00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:23.770
Why did we decide so money,
save money.
Live better.
Woo.
Oh my God.

510
00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:26.250
That was my life for two years.
Oh my God.

511
00:32:26.251 --> 00:32:30.860
It did have more personality that Mommy,
thanks Jean through to shit.

512
00:32:30.861 --> 00:32:34.700
Travis.
Travis,
I liked you until that last line.
Yeah,
that's it.
Okay,

513
00:32:34.701 --> 00:32:35.750
so let's go there.
Right?
Where would

514
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:38.480
<v 3>you rather work at Walmart and have to do that every morning?</v>

515
00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:43.220
That so depressing or what?
Oh my God,
I,
I would,

516
00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:46.670
I would be broke.
Broken spirited for sure.
But then there's this other,

517
00:32:46.671 --> 00:32:50.960
I've had this job before where you call people and you solicit them to buy

518
00:32:50.961 --> 00:32:53.060
tickets to things or to take surveys.

519
00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:57.020
So would I rather do the sales pitch or retarded?

520
00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.780
Okay.
No,
it's Walmart and you do that.

521
00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:04.040
Or you have to go door to door and get people to like save the whales or donate

522
00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:06.290
money to the children.
But you're going door to door.

523
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.410
I would rather do that and you have to do the pitch of like,
hi ma'am,

524
00:33:09.411 --> 00:33:11.540
can I speak to you for just five minutes?
Do you have a moment?

525
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:14.080
I know it's about the same tons.

526
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:19.790
I can't so hard the cheer.
I meant too crazy.
I'd rather do the cheering.

527
00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:24.120
Honestly,
it's so hard to go door to door and get rejected.
I mean I've done,

528
00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:28.420
I've done the call center stuff.
That shit is hard,
man.
Ma,

529
00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:32.720
can I just take five minutes of your time?
I might be doing a survey on eggs.

530
00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:36.040
Did you know that eggs have lower cholesterol and impure?
Really say expected.

531
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:40.820
Yeah,
the extra may was my first job when I was 14.
Horrible,
horrible excuses.

532
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.620
But the fucking,
you know what it is.
I can't fail.
I can't.
Fame Team Spirit.

533
00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:46.400
That's,

534
00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:50.090
that's the soul crushing part is like the really give a shit about Walmart.

535
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:55.280
I know.
Of course.
That's the worst part.
They can't think that you do.
So the top,

536
00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:59.180
top brass here are multibillionaires is my right.

537
00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:04.000
I'm a w.
How much am I making?
12 hour.
All right.

538
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:09.510
Hmm?
Do I get healthcare?
No.
Oh,
just the CEO's.
Oh,
okay.
Sweet man.

539
00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:13.760
Terrible.
It does sound fun.
Oh my God.

540
00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:19.580
You're a fat count again.
Mine.
He'd disgraceful.
I tell Ya

541
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:24.700
that for Bart.
Yeah.
Somebody said,
you know the,

542
00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:26.660
you're a fat count again,

543
00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:31.250
Mike describes the word on the street and I'm not,

544
00:34:31.251 --> 00:34:34.790
I don't know if this is true.
So I don't want to talk out of court at a turn.

545
00:34:34.791 --> 00:34:39.170
Whenever bet a word on the street is that he's gained his weight back.
Is that,

546
00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:42.460
is that accurate?
It's pretty bad.
I mean,

547
00:34:42.461 --> 00:34:46.430
that's everyone I meet when I'm doing stand up there like Burt's fat again.

548
00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:48.020
Every time I go to the store,
they're like,

549
00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:53.030
he was here last night and they're like,
he's a whale.
Wow.
Super enormous.

550
00:34:53.031 --> 00:34:56.280
He did just post a really funny video.
Do you see it?
I,
so the whole coke,

551
00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:00.380
Hulk Hogan.
You got hope.
I love hope.
Kogan yeah,
it was really funny.

552
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:05.210
His wife didn't the Hawke's wife leave him for like one of their daughters

553
00:35:05.211 --> 00:35:08.820
friends,
the 20 year old boy.
I'm like,
God,
how,

554
00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:10.910
how would you murder me if I did that?

555
00:35:10.911 --> 00:35:12.710
Because they were together for a long time.
Hawkin

556
00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:18.750
and honestly when I hear the stories it just sounds more confusing than,
than,

557
00:35:18.751 --> 00:35:22.100
than raging.
I'm like,
wait,
what?
What happened?
I think I'd be like,

558
00:35:22.101 --> 00:35:26.600
what are you doing?
Why?
Why are you ruining our family?
I don't understand.

559
00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.910
I think that would break me.
Like if we have a family together,

560
00:35:31.911 --> 00:35:34.280
we have like our kids are grown and then you're like,

561
00:35:34.281 --> 00:35:38.160
I'm just going out with one of year one of our daughter's friends.
Yeah.

562
00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:41.820
<v 4>I hope you're okay with that.
Like,
no at that would make me kill me.
Solid.</v>

563
00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:45.030
Brings like people to hang out.
And then I just marry one of them.

564
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:51.600
We are marrying his friend,
uh,
Carrie.
She's my girlfriend now.

565
00:35:51.601 --> 00:35:56.460
She's my wife,
Sophomore.
A lot of things she wants to do with their life.

566
00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.630
What do you think,
and why does that marriage,
like what does that have to,

567
00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:01.890
could you imagine right now,

568
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:04.660
and you've talked to 20 year olds and no offense to any 20 year old the night.

569
00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:10.020
I just think that 40 is significantly different than 20 you're just in a

570
00:36:10.021 --> 00:36:14.790
different place.
I'm not shitting on 20 year olds by any means,
but what do you,

571
00:36:14.791 --> 00:36:19.230
what do you think that's like,
I mean,
oh,
it's gotta be torture.
I can't,

572
00:36:19.231 --> 00:36:21.420
I dunno if nothing in common with a,

573
00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:25.680
essentially children's other things leading up to the person doing that though.

574
00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:28.260
It's not that,
it's not that they're like,
I'm just so compelled by you.

575
00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:31.680
You know what I mean?
There's,
there's problems and things not that list.

576
00:36:31.681 --> 00:36:36.270
And then you end up there.
Yeah,
I dunno.
It's crazy.

577
00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:39.880
You'd like it though.
Why would I like it marrying you?

578
00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:43.800
Probably marry a Dalmatian after me,
after me with all these thoughts,
words,
blah,

579
00:36:43.801 --> 00:36:48.390
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Talking.
I mean,
you just want some quiet after me,

580
00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:52.200
you know?
Yeah.
Like you get like a 20 year old Dalmatian.
Easy.

581
00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:57.210
So that's what's next.
That's what you're saying.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now not now.

582
00:36:57.211 --> 00:37:01.040
After I sign has grown and it goes,
no,
you're right.
You're right.
Yeah.

583
00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.830
And then I'll get like five more Brussels Griffon and just like be alone.

584
00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.690
I will let know.
We'll live on the same compound.
Will do.

585
00:37:06.691 --> 00:37:11.610
One of those things would be fine.
We have this big,
it's eight acres.

586
00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:16.690
Uh,
you know,
the thing is that Christina and carrier friend and a totally,

587
00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.870
that's such the 20 year old new wife name Carrie.

588
00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:24.750
She made it so that the estate is appropriately adjusted and um,

589
00:37:24.751 --> 00:37:28.530
you know,
uh,
Christina is taken care of it.
Carrie will also get to go to school.

590
00:37:28.531 --> 00:37:33.180
Eventually.
You have a college fund for you and your wife.
She's like,

591
00:37:33.181 --> 00:37:37.290
when she's ready to go to school,
she'll go,
she's a yoga instructor.

592
00:37:37.291 --> 00:37:41.010
That's always who they marry.
Just teach yoga.
Here we go.

593
00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:46.050
How do you know you're gay if you're blind,
love the show.

594
00:37:46.051 --> 00:37:48.510
I wanted to reach out to you and thinking about the blind and wiping.

595
00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:52.560
What are the ask the follow up that's been driving me crazy.

596
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:58.190
If you are blind and can see people's and see people or faces or biocides only

597
00:37:58.561 --> 00:38:01.620
feel you can't see Jesus,
no one writes the fucking word right.

598
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.680
How do you know if you're gay or straight?
If you are blind,

599
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:08.040
how would you determine your sexual orientation?

600
00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:13.620
How much I needed the answer to this question.
Let me know what you think Travis.

601
00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:18.630
But these are all things people really wonder about.
This show is so important.

602
00:38:18.631 --> 00:38:21.610
We're really doing important work here.
Nobody asks you to leave.

603
00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:26.880
I really applaud him for as
silly as it is.
I applaud you.

604
00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:30.840
That's really silly.
But he's right.
So like let's say you don't,

605
00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:34.320
I mean it's a very cisgender privilege.

606
00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:38.380
Ask you the question isn't like you can't ask like what do you prefer?

607
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.220
Blondes or Brunettes?
Oh No,

608
00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:44.650
you can't even ask what your Pronoun is cause you don't know what the difference

609
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:48.370
who you're looking at.
Um,
yeah,
that's a great question.

610
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.100
How do you know that's such a good point?

611
00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:55.840
I guess when they have sexual encounters and they touch a badge and they're
like,

612
00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.600
you know,
people are sitting,

613
00:38:58.601 --> 00:39:02.980
you know on your lap and you're hugging people and you're like,
yeah,

614
00:39:02.981 --> 00:39:06.550
could you get a boner with when you hug them,
there you go.
Yeah,
that's true.

615
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:10.690
Do you like those dirty pillows mashed against you or not?
Huh?
Hmm.

616
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:15.310
So really good question.
We didn't get any closure on the wiping question.

617
00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:18.760
You just know like you just know man.

618
00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.460
You just know I like or you go no,

619
00:39:21.461 --> 00:39:23.920
you use your hand to wipe and then you smell your hand.

620
00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.750
Like why wouldn't you just smell the paper?

621
00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.790
Why did you go to your cause this you wouldn't understand.

622
00:39:30.791 --> 00:39:33.230
This is like some inside shit.
You don't know about it.

623
00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:38.050
And I talked to some friends and that's what it is.
So it goes how it goes.

624
00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.960
You're cute.
It's true.
You're lucky.
I love,

625
00:39:40.961 --> 00:39:44.560
here's a another email.
It's official.

626
00:39:44.561 --> 00:39:49.561
Tina is not the water stupid after episode 400 stupid has been declared.

627
00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.360
Not only is Tom the water champ,

628
00:39:52.361 --> 00:39:57.240
but due to mommy teen is cowardice of declining the water challenge.
God.

629
00:39:57.241 --> 00:40:00.790
I believe the Tom also needs to be declared personality champion as well.

630
00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:04.030
You can tell that once the challenge was suggested by Maria,

631
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:07.450
Tina was legitimately upset.
Proceeded to insult Tom,

632
00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:12.760
not to mention the disrespectful comments about Tom's anus in the opening

633
00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:16.600
minutes of the episode,
all of which are very negative personality traits.

634
00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.750
I know I certainly wouldn't want to hang out with Christina afterwards.

635
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:23.770
We'll set it up.
So 400 all I do,
however,
believe in second chances,

636
00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.910
nor for Mommy Tina to be a personality water champion contender,

637
00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:33.880
so called black kiss should be awarded a Tom and the trip to Tahiti and exchange

638
00:40:35.021 --> 00:40:37.280
for a black kid should be voided and limit.

639
00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:41.620
The black kiss is upgraded into a rusty trombone.
Oh by God.
Ps,

640
00:40:41.621 --> 00:40:45.520
how do you feel about user submissions of ass rips in order to get the king out

641
00:40:45.521 --> 00:40:50.200
of hiding?
I know you guys have tried to contact him,
but haven't had much luck.

642
00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:53.590
I believe the only way to make him return is to instigate a fart war.

643
00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:56.800
God bless Kyle.
Can I tell you this?
I don't know about

644
00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:02.740
farting and submitting that.
I have to tell you something.
King ash ripper,

645
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:06.580
who as many of you know is a,
a staple of the show

646
00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:14.160
so much and he rejects us.
He's an amazing guy.
Great.

647
00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:19.060
So a lot of you know him as a fighter and a Berber I think too.

648
00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:24.220
I don't want to just paint,
put him in that box.
You know,

649
00:41:24.221 --> 00:41:27.250
a big thing that he also has done that we've highlighted,

650
00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:32.251
but maybe not as much as he's also a glutton and he likes to overeat and gain

651
00:41:33.621 --> 00:41:37.430
weight.
You're not going to believe what he looks like now.

652
00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:42.380
He has really put on some weight.
He's been doing,

653
00:41:42.381 --> 00:41:44.510
he hasn't been putting out as many fart videos,

654
00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:47.490
but he's been putting out the stuffing himself videos.
Well,

655
00:41:47.491 --> 00:41:51.110
he's always evolving as an artist.
We've never been able to just make him do.

656
00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:52.580
He's not a one trick pony,
but yeah,

657
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:56.600
but you remember how he had like the little who she got a little belly and he

658
00:41:56.601 --> 00:42:00.620
was like,
oh,
I'm having donuts.
Okay.
It's been awhile.

659
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:01.620
You got to see him.

660
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:06.200
<v 10>Oh God damn.
Mcdonald's.</v>

661
00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:07.750
<v 4>Okay.</v>

662
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:12.330
<v 10>Is that a prosthetic belly max making dog.</v>

663
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:18.610
God
goddamn chili dogs.

664
00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:23.890
<v 4>Oh,
by the way,
they shouldn't accomplished.
He's fat as fuck now.
Yeah,</v>

665
00:42:23.891 --> 00:42:28.760
you really did it,
man.
Now it's also hard fat.
It looks hard.

666
00:42:28.761 --> 00:42:33.350
It's hard.
But I mean he's,
I would say he's Gillen again from the early days.

667
00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:36.770
This has gotta be 60 80 pounds and this is real weight.

668
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:41.240
Real weight men that's going on with it.
I don't know.
Look at that thing.

669
00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:44.020
Oh my God.
He looks pregnant.
As you can see.
Look,

670
00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:47.510
you can see his belly at the bottom of the pillow.
Oh my God,
dude,

671
00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:49.190
I don't like that.
I don't like it.

672
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.550
Here we go back to basics king.

673
00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:59.330
Look,
I know the parts are what we live for,
but,
but I got to say,

674
00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:03.440
I know how much you wanted this,
so I just wanted to congratulate him.

675
00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:07.820
That's really cool,
man.
I wanted to point something out.
Yeah.

676
00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:13.000
I feel like there's a new contest evolving between the two of us.
Yeah.

677
00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:13.990
Firstly,

678
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:18.990
I address that previous gentleman's email about me not wanting to compete INSEAD

679
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:22.430
water consumption contest.
A,

680
00:43:22.431 --> 00:43:25.580
I don't need to compete because I know I am the water channel.

681
00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:30.360
You said that that day.
I mean it's very silly.
I don't need to,

682
00:43:30.361 --> 00:43:32.820
it's what's known as a cop out.
It's not a cop out.

683
00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:37.520
You're showboater your all when the lights are on.
The cameras are rolling.

684
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:41.810
Oh,
I'm hydrating.
First of all.
Where's your water right now?
No,
no,
no.
Really?

685
00:43:41.811 --> 00:43:45.740
Where is it?
Go ahead.
Why is that?
Because I'm too hydrated.
Negative.

686
00:43:45.741 --> 00:43:48.110
You're drinking coffee and that's negative water.

687
00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:51.230
Everyone knows that because what am I drinking?
Oh look,

688
00:43:51.231 --> 00:43:55.310
I have a Fiji water right here and this is also loaded with minerals and we

689
00:43:55.311 --> 00:43:57.410
learned from our water,
Somalia,

690
00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:01.310
but see the thing is I had four of those before the show and that's upsetting

691
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:06.350
lie bro.
Why are you lying?
You never even even had water today.
You lie,

692
00:44:06.351 --> 00:44:09.140
you lie to them all the time.
The mommies don't even know how much you lie,

693
00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:12.740
not participate in my,
God's a good point because you lie.

694
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:17.570
It's like somebody saying,
um,
I'm better at you and basketball.

695
00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:20.660
Let's play.
And you go,
I already know him better,

696
00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:23.210
so I'm not going to play the goddess of water.

697
00:44:23.211 --> 00:44:24.230
Consumption's that's what I'm saying.

698
00:44:24.231 --> 00:44:26.690
Anybody that's seen me perform live during my special,

699
00:44:26.691 --> 00:44:31.180
even I had the wherewithal to drink,
uh,
bottles of water.
I mean,
I,

700
00:44:31.181 --> 00:44:32.070
I'm just that

701
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:34.470
<v 3>dedicated.
I don't need,
secondly,</v>

702
00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:39.120
I feel like there's a new game in town and I think I've noticed over the years,

703
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:41.490
I've known you for 12 years.
That's how long we've been together.

704
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:43.980
That generally speaking,

705
00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:49.160
I'm more observant than you and I notice things and details and I read more.

706
00:44:51.421 --> 00:44:55.290
I'm generally more observant and I would say that I'm the observation champ.

707
00:44:55.291 --> 00:44:59.910
Thank you.
Yeah,
that's my,
go ahead.
Apply it to that would be,

708
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.910
and this is like I would say was on a witness stand,
right.

709
00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:07.770
Amongst the least observant people at trooper.
How so?
How so?

710
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:12.510
Go ahead.
Everything goes over your head.
Like what?
Don't remember who was there.

711
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:17.030
That's a memory champ.
That's not memories involved with observation.
No,

712
00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:21.660
I'm saying that in a room of things.
I know it's different.
Immediately.

713
00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:24.720
I walk into my shrink's office every week and I can,

714
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:29.490
I was at a new book and on the shelf by,
yes,
it is.
She,
you're very observant.

715
00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:32.970
I am sure.
Okay,
well,
I noticed everything.

716
00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.820
Your mother coupled with a different hairstyle.
Oh my gosh.
Look at you.

717
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:37.260
You don't notice anything.

718
00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:42.030
I think the idea that you're actually worked up about this and you can tell how

719
00:45:42.031 --> 00:45:45.740
little I am because it's like you saying you're stronger than me and I'm like,

720
00:45:45.741 --> 00:45:50.340
okay,
so I think it's cute that you'll cute.
Yeah.

721
00:45:50.341 --> 00:45:53.970
It's cute that you think this and oh my gosh,
I'm so observant

722
00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:56.260
clips.

723
00:45:56.260 --> 00:46:00.940
I am the one that points out the interesting minutia and the details of,

724
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:06.030
no,
not only do you never do,
that's 100% me.

725
00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:08.100
You should have the listeners weigh in on that.

726
00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:12.960
You are not only not observant.

727
00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:17.850
I would say you're,
you're oblivious to your dense,

728
00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:22.030
it's a big word.
You're,
you're just,
you're not aware.
You're not present stuff.

729
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:26.700
You're present person.
It's not about presence.
This is observant.

730
00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:30.450
This is noticing things,
putting things together.

731
00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:34.860
It's just very good at that.
You're just not very observant.
Uh,
yeah,

732
00:46:34.861 --> 00:46:37.980
I think it would go you then Ellis than me though.
That'd be the order.

733
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:42.870
She's just,
I notice things about Ellis all the time.
Okay.

734
00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:46.410
Now the one thing I can't do,
and you've brought this up before,

735
00:46:46.411 --> 00:46:49.140
is sometimes I can't read people emotionally.

736
00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:53.790
That's a big part of my observations.
But that's because of my upbringing.

737
00:46:53.791 --> 00:46:56.820
Because I was raised by a mentally ill person and I don't always identify

738
00:46:56.821 --> 00:46:58.860
feelings properly,
but I'm in therapy for it.

739
00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:02.070
I'm with you all the time and you're,
and I'll say something and you're like,

740
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:05.280
I didn't notice that.
And I'm like,
yeah.
And then you go,
really?

741
00:47:05.281 --> 00:47:07.310
Because I can't tell feelings and I've told it,

742
00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:09.250
but that's because I'm in therapy for that.

743
00:47:09.251 --> 00:47:13.140
That's part of being the observation champ.
I think that,
I know.

744
00:47:13.141 --> 00:47:17.730
I think that's a fraction of the observation champs.
Here's what I'm good at.

745
00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:22.080
An observation world.
No,
I'm serious.
I can listen to somebody talk and then I go,

746
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:27.140
Oh I know what their notice or issues or odd had a pair of shoes on that if we

747
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:30.220
have dinner with somebody and I'll be like,
did you notice how

748
00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:34.450
<v 4>he spoke to her,
his wife this way?
And that happened that dynamic.</v>

749
00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:38.800
And you be like,
Oh yeah,
no.
I'm like,
cause you're not observant all the time.

750
00:47:38.801 --> 00:47:39.670
I'll be like,
oh my gosh,

751
00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:42.890
did she know his child to thing is because of this and that I can,

752
00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:47.890
I can break down what am I lying while my be able to say that.
You never say,

753
00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:50.990
did you notice that he talked to it?
And then I go,
no,
I didn't know.

754
00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:54.430
I always say yeah of course I did and this,
this and that.

755
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:58.150
So you're trying to describe the ringing at first cause I'm the observation

756
00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:01.230
champ.
I bring it up.
You just agree with me.

757
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:08.620
I am definitely not stronger that I will give you,

758
00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:12.360
I don't have a full beard and I am not strong or not,

759
00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:15.460
but my vision and hearing is much better than yours as well.

760
00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:18.900
And my teeth are wider.
Just like your sister.
I perfect teeth and perfect.

761
00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:25.330
Yeah.
The vision is recent.
I used to have the sharpest vision in California

762
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:30.520
I have is deteriorated.
And how bad is it now,

763
00:48:30.521 --> 00:48:34.810
Grandpa Cataracts Ag Canada?
It's bad.
No,

764
00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:37.480
really?
No,
it's not bad,
but it's I,

765
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:41.080
I mean I prefer to wear the glasses when I'm reading,

766
00:48:41.081 --> 00:48:44.290
when I'm looking at mostly anything.
Yeah.
Your dad glasses,

767
00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:50.110
everything is sharper and sharper and clearer.
Your blue blockers,

768
00:48:50.111 --> 00:48:53.620
you got those on here's a review or was this on iTunes?

769
00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:58.500
The Hay,
Hitler's thing.
We can't seem to shake as a meme.

770
00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:04.840
So many people yelling at her and I have to talk about it when I opened for you.

771
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:05.740
Well,
that's right.

772
00:49:05.741 --> 00:49:10.120
We made a list of things people were not allowed to do and number one was don't

773
00:49:10.121 --> 00:49:13.870
shout,
Hey Hitler.
It'll interfere with the recording.
This says,
Hey Hitler's.

774
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:17.230
This is a review on iTunes,
which by the way,

775
00:49:17.231 --> 00:49:19.870
of course I encourage anyone that listens to the show,

776
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:25.120
give us a five star well-written genes.
Tastic review only a five star.

777
00:49:25.121 --> 00:49:27.480
Why?
Why go anything less?
Hey,
Hitler's,

778
00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:30.550
you've got to get your life and listening to this podcast from high and tight

779
00:49:30.551 --> 00:49:31.690
jeans.
Dad boners,

780
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:35.740
lots of Stan Ama and glass and they cover lots of ground like burnt,

781
00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:37.420
burnt Chrysler's fat ass.

782
00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:42.760
The podcasting world is the belt on the media world and this podcast is the

783
00:49:42.761 --> 00:49:47.260
buckle that was powerful.
That is by Nolan from Winnipeg,

784
00:49:47.261 --> 00:49:48.850
and a very observant review.
I might add,

785
00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:52.870
I knew this was Canadian because it says Rogers is a screen grab of the Rogers,

786
00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:56.080
um,
review that he's sending Roger's Roger's cellular.

787
00:49:56.290 --> 00:50:00.460
I know that that's because they're in Canada.
Observant.
But you know,
I knew that,

788
00:50:00.461 --> 00:50:05.420
I knew that idea that you're Canadian.
You didn't know I was born in Windsor,

789
00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:09.670
Ontario.
Bright.
You're Canadian.
That's my fucking point.
Yes.
And I knew,

790
00:50:09.671 --> 00:50:14.110
I knew Rogers.
I did it.
Just took me a second.
Gosh,

791
00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:18.950
very soon we'll be joined by the Great Wheeler Walker Jr.
Uh,

792
00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:23.080
the country music singer.
You're a huge performer.
I really liked his stuff.

793
00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:24.750
I've really enjoyed it for a while.

794
00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:27.430
Now a lot of people think you two are the same person.
It's,

795
00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:32.300
I've gotten dozens of tweets.
Maybe hundreds.
Hmm.

796
00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:36.530
About,
Hey,
I've never seen you two in the same room at the same time.
Blah,

797
00:50:36.531 --> 00:50:39.800
blah blah.
It's so funny cause I get the same one with Claudia Schiffer.

798
00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:42.380
People are like,
oh my God.
And then then you're like,
it's not me.

799
00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:47.470
That's not me guys.
Yeah.
That was one of my early crushes shorter than me.
Yeah.

800
00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:51.640
She's so pretty.
And just Kinda,
what made you think of her?

801
00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:55.720
I was thinking of Heidi Klum,
but she has those little rabbit teeth.

802
00:50:55.721 --> 00:50:58.510
She's got those real feminine front to Rabbit Teeth.

803
00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:02.470
I wanted my veneers to look a little ride more rabbity but he did it.

804
00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:07.350
He did it already on these,
well my two college roommates who you knew,
you know?

805
00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.273
Yeah.
Uh,

806
00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:12.020
we had a poster of her somewhere in her house thinking that kitchen Heidi of

807
00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:16.620
Heidi decorum.
Yeah.
In,
in college.
She's still rocking,
man.
She looks great.

808
00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:21.510
She looks amazing.
So the Germans,
let's see here,
Claudia Schiffer.
Claudia.

809
00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:27.240
Let's see.
Why do you think those crowds age so well?
I don't know.
Here she is.

810
00:51:27.241 --> 00:51:32.040
I think this set,
I tried to find a recent photo and she looks good.

811
00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:35.490
Yeah.
How old is she?
By 50 by now.
Yeah.
Oh,

812
00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:42.420
pause cause mom,

813
00:51:42.421 --> 00:51:46.890

00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:09.840
as we were discussing a moment ago is I keep getting tweets and say,

821
00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:12.900
I've never seen you and Wheeler Walker in the room at the same time.

822
00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:15.730
<v 11>Yeah.
I want to put that in people.
I've seen a lot of people,
um,</v>

823
00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:20.970
Photoshop your head onto mine on the album cover.
Yup.
Oh my goodness.
Yeah,

824
00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:23.110
I've seen that too.
Which is,
by the way,
if we were the same guy,

825
00:52:23.111 --> 00:52:24.610
you wouldn't need to photo.
It would just be you.

826
00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:29.170
<v 4>Right.
Good point.
I've heard,
I've heard that the like your,
that I'm you,</v>

827
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:32.420
I've heard that Zach's,
you,
I've heard that Brent Hoffman.

828
00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:34.210
Do you I've heard all these different guys.

829
00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:36.230
<v 11>Yeah.
For everyone.
Everyone thinks I'm some guy,</v>

830
00:52:36.231 --> 00:52:39.080
but I like to everyone they think I am.
I like to get,
you know,

831
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:41.200
be on their podcast.
Here we are talking by the way.

832
00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:43.273
<v 4>Okay.</v>

833
00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:47.310
<v 11>It wouldn't take too much special effects to,
to um,</v>

834
00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:49.190
have you talking to yourself right now?

835
00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:52.170
<v 4>You know what they're going to point out now is that we're on different cameras.</v>

836
00:52:52.290 --> 00:52:55.110
Exactly.
So we're not the same fucking let's talk about,
let's talk.

837
00:52:55.111 --> 00:52:58.920
Let's talk over each other.
No,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I mean it's like a ha.
I mean,

838
00:52:58.921 --> 00:53:00.910
you've got to talk and talk.
Talk while I'm sorry.
Here we go.
Yes.

839
00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:04.060
Different fucking guys.
But then they're going to say,
you just lay it on the IBM,

840
00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:06.880
by the way.
Again,
the easiest thing to do.

841
00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:10.800
Do you have really similar beard?
Yeah.
Color patterns as well.

842
00:53:10.801 --> 00:53:12.550
Our length is pretty similar.
Oh

843
00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:15.470
<v 11>yeah.
By the way,
you're looking good.
Thanks buddy.
The,
the,
the,
uh,</v>

844
00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:18.680
I did Brett's pod had a blast with red,

845
00:53:18.681 --> 00:53:23.450
but I love this whole Tom and oh and burns a Chrysler.
Yeah,
I said Brett,

846
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:27.840
the bird thing is really cool because I love how you guys are really like,

847
00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:31.320
it's real and you got,
and it's also healthy.
It's like,
yeah,

848
00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:34.050
we lost a lot of weight and I mean obviously I lost more,
but yeah,

849
00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:38.190
obviously you look fatter to you.
You just saw him recently.

850
00:53:38.191 --> 00:53:42.270
You said Bert burnt.
How fat does he look burnt?
Um,

851
00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:47.490
I think,
well I didn't really,
I didn't size them up too much before,

852
00:53:47.491 --> 00:53:50.130
but I just walking and seeing you.

853
00:53:50.131 --> 00:53:53.010
I would say you're like a healthy kind of the shape.
I mean,

854
00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:55.800
I would if you'd said you were big before,
I wouldn't have know.

855
00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:59.820
Like to me you just look like a kind of a skinny.
And how's that?
I mean,

856
00:53:59.821 --> 00:54:04.440
but in relation to Tom,
how much bigger it is burnt look than Tom?

857
00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:08.220
Well,
I don't wanna get myself in trouble,
but I am here right now.
So I would say,

858
00:54:08.221 --> 00:54:11.550
I would say you look thinner that you definitely,
it's not even close to me.

859
00:54:11.551 --> 00:54:15.800
I think.
I think he's just got to pick your brain.
I'll tell Ya.

860
00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:20.520
One of the things I love on this as you do the those,
so you know,

861
00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:24.860
I love that like the stern still like the old radio stuff.
It drops,
it's fun,

862
00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:28.140
it's fun.
Um,
but yeah,
he,
I think he's got it maybe a bigger frame.

863
00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:33.170
Like I feel like he's always going to kind of look like a bigger dude at Tito's

864
00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:38.280
diet that he's on.
See,
the thing is he tries to fight the Tito's,

865
00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:42.300
so he keeps her is Tequila Vodka drink.
He drinks his vodka,

866
00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:45.960
but then he works out and he,
his body perfectly reflects it.

867
00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:50.760
He looks like a guy that drinks a lot but then also runs.
Yeah,
you can't,

868
00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:54.420
you can't,
that's not special.

869
00:54:54.421 --> 00:54:56.660
But I found this on the road,
which is,

870
00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:58.590
I mean you guys get to fly in and you know,

871
00:54:58.591 --> 00:55:02.070
stay in hotels and shit and people don't believe me,

872
00:55:02.071 --> 00:55:06.630
but you really can't part like a traveling musician.
You can't party on the road,

873
00:55:06.631 --> 00:55:11.610
it just doesn't work.
Like
the legends are that,
you know,

874
00:55:11.611 --> 00:55:15.030
they're just fucking getting ripped every night.
It's like you meet it,
you know,

875
00:55:15.031 --> 00:55:17.130
you get,
you could draw,
first of all,

876
00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:19.980
we're always leaving and going on to the next town.
It's like

877
00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:22.820
all my friends of course,
where you don't,

878
00:55:22.821 --> 00:55:24.480
you're getting laid and every town it's like,
I meet a girl,

879
00:55:24.481 --> 00:55:24.900
what am I going to do?

880
00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:28.880
Take her on the bus and then take her with me to the next city.
Right.
Um,

881
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:34.530
I've done that.
But yeah,
what do you do is you don't,
uh,
you don't get late.

882
00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:38.720
Yeah.
Right.
And I've just found out I've just,
and I hate to admit it,

883
00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:41.040
it ruins my image,
but to,
uh,

884
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:46.740
I'm playing with it.
I can't play with a dog and talk at the same time.
It's cool.

885
00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:51.080
Um,
sorry,
I,
Betsy,
come on my,

886
00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:55.830
my problem is I can't have one beer.
It just,
I'd rather,

887
00:55:55.831 --> 00:55:57.930
I'd much rather have no alcohol.

888
00:55:57.931 --> 00:56:01.200
Then one day I just rather be sober than one beer,
cause one beer.

889
00:56:01.201 --> 00:56:04.200
I want a second.
I don't want to say like I'm an alcoholic or something,
but

890
00:56:05.970 --> 00:56:08.370
one beer to me and one shy,
just pointless.

891
00:56:08.371 --> 00:56:10.770
It's just like a little taste of like the fun you can have.

892
00:56:10.771 --> 00:56:14.260
But the problem about being sober is,
and you know,

893
00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:19.340
like a music club is you're the only fucking sober dude in the whole place and

894
00:56:19.441 --> 00:56:22.630
everyone's looking at you.
So you would rather just leave,
let me know.

895
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.220
I don't do anything

896
00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:26.020
<v 4>for me.
Uh,
having a beer isn't problem.</v>

897
00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:29.920
I like the one that I keep going down with his booze.

898
00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:33.700
Like if I have a vodka drink or something.
Yeah.
Then I went two or three,

899
00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:38.230
you know,
so I,
so I don't even start and I just go,

900
00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:43.540
I don't like hanging out late in these loud bang.
I'm like an old guy.

901
00:56:43.770 --> 00:56:47.080
Yeah.
I don't like,
yeah,
I'm the same way,
which is,
you know,

902
00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:51.040
but you're the pussy king too.
Yeah.
How is that because of you're a persona?

903
00:56:51.041 --> 00:56:54.970
I mean,
from what I,
I'm not,
no offense,
I'm not a huge country fan per se,

904
00:56:54.971 --> 00:56:59.230
but we love your videos.
I love them because they're so provocative.

905
00:56:59.231 --> 00:57:02.770
And you're out there and you kind of do come across as the pussy king.

906
00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:03.770
He is the postseason.

907
00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:05.490
<v 11>Right.
If that's your thing.
Yeah.</v>

908
00:57:05.491 --> 00:57:09.330
I mean that's my thing was I wanted to kind of mark myself on this new record
is,

909
00:57:09.331 --> 00:57:12.660
like I said before,
um,
you know,

910
00:57:12.661 --> 00:57:17.460
Elvis was the king and Michael Jackson was the king of pop and like,
what am I,

911
00:57:17.461 --> 00:57:20.970
you know,
there's only one left,
right?
Yeah.
The pussy king.
So I'll just,
once you,

912
00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:23.700
once you start saying it,
you know,
like stern king of all media,

913
00:57:23.701 --> 00:57:25.980
you just start saying,
I'll just start saying I'm the pussy king.
Yeah.

914
00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:30.360
And it sticks.
Oh,
by the way,
I hear,
yeah,
yeah.
Let's see what you got.

915
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:35.040
Here's the new record.
Wow.
Oh Wow.
Oh,
this looks great.

916
00:57:35.370 --> 00:57:37.980
And uh,
most important digital download inside,

917
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.750
look at the man sticker banned from Walmart,
target and best buy,

918
00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:46.110
which was kind of bummed me out because you know,

919
00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:49.380
our goal was to have the number one country album in the country,

920
00:57:49.381 --> 00:57:53.710
but these country fans still fucking buy cds from like Walmart.
Sure.
So weird.

921
00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:57.060
We the one here's some fucked up.
Yeah,
my album,

922
00:57:58.610 --> 00:58:01.560
it's kind of hard to say no after.
I prefer phrase it like that.
But um,

923
00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:05.880
we had the fifth bestselling country album in America last week.
That's crazy,

924
00:58:05.881 --> 00:58:07.620
man.
Congratulations.
Thanks man.

925
00:58:07.621 --> 00:58:11.160
But on the billboard country charts where number 10,
why is that?

926
00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:14.760
Because they do this new fucking thing too to keep the Keith Urban's of the

927
00:58:14.761 --> 00:58:18.120
world happy that they now incorporate like streaming and radio plays in it.

928
00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:19.290
They keep that they,

929
00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:24.630
they have in that in they like have a weird like algorithm and so like,
you know,

930
00:58:24.631 --> 00:58:26.340
because to them,
and I guess it's true,

931
00:58:26.341 --> 00:58:30.750
which is a Keith urban is more popular than me.
Right.
I don't see that,
but okay.

932
00:58:30.751 --> 00:58:31.490
We'll thing but yeah.

933
00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:33.680
<v 4>Well I don't like let's,
let's uh,</v>

934
00:58:33.681 --> 00:58:37.270

00:59:49.901 --> 00:59:53.050
which I'm starting to get pissed about.
I'm like,
hmm.
Because the interviewers,

954
00:59:53.051 --> 00:59:54.590
you know,
we'll do a lot of phone interviews,
you know,

955
00:59:55.210 --> 00:59:57.940
you know which one he queer is going to suck my dick.
You know,

956
00:59:58.870 --> 01:00:01.930
it's like homophobic.
I'm like,
no,
it's a homosexual.
Yeah,

957
01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:03.370
you're asking them to suck your Dick.

958
01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.580
It's like I'm the only fucking guy in country music talking about guys blowing

959
01:00:06.581 --> 01:00:09.040
me getting so drunk that they do.

960
01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:13.420
What I'm trying to do is obviously pissed off Nashville and I just really get

961
01:00:13.421 --> 01:00:14.254
off on pissing people.

962
01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:18.830
<v 0>I want to ask you this,
cause I,
I didn't grow up really in the country,</v>

963
01:00:18.831 --> 01:00:23.120
but I did for a while live in Florida and it started to get,
you know,

964
01:00:23.121 --> 01:00:26.630
it's just part of the culture started to get into it more.

965
01:00:26.631 --> 01:00:29.360
And so actually I've been to,
I went to a Clint black concert,

966
01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:34.010
I started to hear Hank Williams junior stuff like that was,
yeah,
I mean,

967
01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:35.900
so I started to hear some of the music.

968
01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:39.320
There's a lot of like nice bullshit,

969
01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:42.410
especially in that call in the country culture.

970
01:00:42.730 --> 01:00:47.300
You're one of the guys who's actually being like a little more like,
look,

971
01:00:47.301 --> 01:00:49.130
it's not all fucking hugs and kisses man.

972
01:00:49.131 --> 01:00:50.870
Like you're kind of talking talk some shit.

973
01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:53.860
<v 11>What it used to Piss me off is I,</v>

974
01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:57.630
cause I know a lot of these guys and then they'll press cut on the album and I'm

975
01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.800
getting,
there'll be like,
man I got some fucking pussy last night.

976
01:00:59.801 --> 01:01:04.270
But I'm like why are you saving the interesting shit for often like record that.

977
01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:04.930
Yeah.

978
01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:08.620
I mean I know you got to pay for your Butler and private planes and I know they

979
01:01:08.621 --> 01:01:13.621
can't play that shit on the radio but it's like wouldn't it be nice if someone

980
01:01:14.290 --> 01:01:18.220
cause the biggest genre in the world right now in America I'm sure by far is hip

981
01:01:18.221 --> 01:01:21.010
hop because those go in and that stuff's hard.
X

982
01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:21.980
<v 0>cause I know like,</v>

983
01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:26.090
and it's all controvert and it's also like beefs and like wanting to fight now

984
01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:28.620
you talk shit about some of the other guys even though,

985
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.460
<v 11>yeah.
One Guy I'm that I talk shit about on the,</v>

986
01:01:31.461 --> 01:01:35.660
on the Song Poon I actually texted me the other day saying that he was honored

987
01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:38.990
really?
So I thought that was cool.
He say who it is or no.
Yeah,
I'll say it.

988
01:01:38.991 --> 01:01:41.600
It's got Jake Owen who is a big country star.

989
01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:43.600
<v 0>We went to high school in the same city.</v>

990
01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:47.620
<v 11>No Way.
Yeah.
So,
um,
I always like it when,
you know,</v>

991
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.490
and he said he was honored to yeah,
I mean fans,

992
01:01:51.491 --> 01:01:54.040
they'll probably be pissed to know that like the guy even has my number,

993
01:01:54.041 --> 01:01:58.760
but I've met him and he's a nice guy,
nice guy.
And like in my head,
you know,

994
01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:03.130
be all I did.
Poon is just a song where I just kind of rip on all the,

995
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.851
and I literally,

996
01:02:03.851 --> 01:02:07.840
I took the iTunes country charts from that day that was in the studio and I just

997
01:02:08.110 --> 01:02:10.600
made them all raw rhyme,
you know,
so it was really

998
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:14.610
<v 0>fucking talented at this man.
Can I ask you this though?
Because I,</v>

999
01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:18.090
I know like,
like we were just talking about how country stars,

1000
01:02:18.091 --> 01:02:20.040
you're expected be super nice

1001
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.620
<v 11>all the time and really accommodating to the fans.
Like Garth Brooks,</v>

1002
01:02:22.621 --> 01:02:26.190
we follow him on social media.
Yeah,
I agree.

1003
01:02:26.191 --> 01:02:29.100
I don't think he's fantastic.
And if that gets me in trouble a lot too,

1004
01:02:29.101 --> 01:02:31.920
which is I fucking hate Garth Brooks.
I hate them too.

1005
01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:36.000
And I think his music and I hit his shin.
I could go on for an hour,

1006
01:02:36.001 --> 01:02:39.420
but I think he's part,
he's part of the reason country music.
Guts shitty.

1007
01:02:40.030 --> 01:02:42.750
Cause he was the first guy who kind of went pop.
Yeah.

1008
01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:47.370
And kind of took the country.
All this like any pander so much.
It's so fake.

1009
01:02:47.371 --> 01:02:50.160
I find him to be very this and genuine alerts.

1010
01:02:51.890 --> 01:02:53.820
What's that?
He'll,
he'll have on Twitter.
It's like,

1011
01:02:53.821 --> 01:02:57.120
it's like a flashing letter g g alert and then he'll,
you'll see him,

1012
01:02:57.180 --> 01:03:00.540
you'll see him in his fucking,
you know his mansion.
Like it's a g alert.

1013
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:03.970
He's like,
I don't know if I can tell you guys,
it's like some top secret thing.

1014
01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:07.050
So you're like waiting for like,
you know this big news.

1015
01:03:07.051 --> 01:03:08.340
Like you know he's retiring or whatever it is.

1016
01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:10.100
And the g alert is that he's playing it.

1017
01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:11.860
<v 3>Atlanta.
Yeah,
that's what I was just saying.</v>

1018
01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:17.160
Cause I follow him on Instagram and he'll be like big news,
big surprise.

1019
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:20.940
Swipe up to see it.
Just swipe up to see it.
And then you look and he's like,

1020
01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:24.440
I'm coming to Bose,
your city.
And you're like,
that's a surprise asshole.

1021
01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:27.150
You going to go there anyways.
It's not breaking news.

1022
01:03:27.151 --> 01:03:30.050
He's always in studio g studio.

1023
01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:37.380
You'll also refer to himself as when they're singing happy birthday.

1024
01:03:37.381 --> 01:03:41.280
He's like happy birthday to g said it to himself.

1025
01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.920
He calls himself,
Gee,
you're like,
dude,
you fucking,

1026
01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:45.150
and that's why I get pissed because that

1027
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:49.840
<v 11>truth because,
so he's,
I don't know this much about it.</v>

1028
01:03:49.870 --> 01:03:53.360
I don't know the man,
but he was married and he doesn't do a Trish.
No,

1029
01:03:53.370 --> 01:03:54.970
he's married.
Married before.
But then Jerry,

1030
01:03:54.971 --> 01:03:58.420
before Dan does a duet with Trisha Yearwood,
now he's married to Trisha Yearwood.

1031
01:03:58.421 --> 01:04:00.580
So there's obviously a lot of shitty ain't singing about right.

1032
01:04:02.170 --> 01:04:05.270
That's the song we want to hear.
You know?
So that's why it gets,

1033
01:04:05.271 --> 01:04:08.440
it's like country music used to be about the truth and now it's just a bunch of

1034
01:04:08.441 --> 01:04:10.150
bullshit.
He's holding the phone.

1035
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:14.110
Like when you sell tickets at any level,

1036
01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:17.770
you know you have sounds like it's cause people want to see you,
you have fans.

1037
01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.570
And I get it that like,
you know you're going to be,

1038
01:04:19.571 --> 01:04:23.650
obviously you're appreciative,
you want to be nice to your fans,
you want to say,

1039
01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:28.060
but the level of like it just seems disingenuous to be like,

1040
01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:31.090
<v 3>Ha,
yeah,
I'm so,</v>

1041
01:04:31.091 --> 01:04:35.590
I'm so overwhelmed and shout outs to every single person that follows him on

1042
01:04:35.591 --> 01:04:36.640
Twitter.
Like eat bro.

1043
01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:41.810
How can you be sorry I took something I do on podcasts a lot.

1044
01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:44.650
Interrupting people and I got to stop doing it.
No,
it's all good.
We're good.

1045
01:04:45.070 --> 01:04:49.120
We cut out that part.
I interrupted.
Christina was really embarrassing,
but,

1046
01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:52.120
well just say what?
I had a on Facebook.

1047
01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:56.470
I really wasn't sure if that's his dealer friend of mine said something that

1048
01:04:56.471 --> 01:05:00.350
just made all kinds of sense.
She said think of it more as a conversation.

1049
01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:01.810
Throw up in my mouth,

1050
01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:06.970
but I'm already finding out on my own so it's wiping the walls out between you

1051
01:05:06.971 --> 01:05:10.270
and me.
But I really was like,
that's like a gay video.
Yeah.

1052
01:05:10.271 --> 01:05:12.220
Like he's been trying to meet a dude on the Internet.
Yeah.

1053
01:05:12.221 --> 01:05:13.960
It is like a gay video.
Well I am.

1054
01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:17.170
It allows us to into each other's worlds where I can,
I guess in my case,

1055
01:05:18.110 --> 01:05:22.150
<v 12>the hotel room,
when I think about things I want to post,</v>

1056
01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:24.620
I want to post cool stuff,
slick stuff.

1057
01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:29.260
Most stuff I'm going to post is going to be raw stuff like this.

1058
01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:30.693
That's not wrong.

1059
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:37.000
He's wearing his own merge so this is truly a conversation and I say let the

1060
01:05:37.001 --> 01:05:39.440
conversation begin.
So

1061
01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:41.970
<v 11>contrived and there's no,
there's no natural to that.</v>

1062
01:05:42.070 --> 01:05:45.930
Like your uncle trying out social media.
Yes,
exactly.

1063
01:05:45.931 --> 01:05:50.580
How it comes to Dolly Parton is famous for being super fan friendly.

1064
01:05:50.610 --> 01:05:55.200
Like I know that she lets people like sleep on her front lawn or I've heard

1065
01:05:56.280 --> 01:06:01.260
she's got Dollywood out outside of Nashville.
Do you let people do that to you?

1066
01:06:01.261 --> 01:06:04.720
Do you let people sleep out on your line?
Like how,
no,
no,
no.

1067
01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:06.400
My thing is I have a,

1068
01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:10.650
this is why I think one popular in the country.

1069
01:06:10.651 --> 01:06:14.370
Why don't think what people dig about me is like if you look at my comments,

1070
01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:17.250
it's all kind of like the Tom and Burt thing.

1071
01:06:17.251 --> 01:06:20.550
It was just like it was a lot of people just,
you're fucking fat.
You fuck you.

1072
01:06:20.551 --> 01:06:24.870
So all my comments are just fans.
Like,
like,
oh,
not the tour.
And they're like,

1073
01:06:24.871 --> 01:06:28.020
you're not complaining my city.
Fuck you.
It's a bunch of people.
It's a bunch of,

1074
01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:32.280
all my fans told me to go fuck myself,
which I kind of appreciate,

1075
01:06:32.281 --> 01:06:36.270
which is so that I'll go,
I'll go onto Twitter and just be like this.

1076
01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:41.090
If you tweet me your city one more time.
I didn't come into it ever.
Wow.
And so,

1077
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:44.100
because I'm just sick of them just being like,
they don't know how tours work.

1078
01:06:44.101 --> 01:06:45.420
It's not actual,

1079
01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:48.120
doesn't go through his Twitter and see where the fans want to play and then pick

1080
01:06:48.121 --> 01:06:52.980
dates.
I man,
I keep explaining to them that for,
at least for us,

1081
01:06:52.981 --> 01:06:53.850
like,
you know,

1082
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:58.910
a promoter approaches me with a routing except actually don't,

1083
01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:03.690
and it's predetermined will me more than you.
I would bet because I got the band.

1084
01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:05.580
Yeah,
sure.
True.
And we're route,
he's like,

1085
01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:08.910
Toronto's not on the way between Nashville and Chattanooga.

1086
01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:12.810
We can't just go up to fucking pen.
They're like,
well,
add it bitch.
Yeah,
exactly.

1087
01:07:12.890 --> 01:07:14.460
All right.
There's a guy who,
I'm on my,

1088
01:07:14.610 --> 01:07:18.110
on my Facebook and tell me if you guys have found,
I've,
uh,

1089
01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:23.250
Facebook is by far the main gist.
I don't know why.
I think also those,

1090
01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:26.460
whatever his comments,
it sits there,
right?
Like Twitter kind of goes away.

1091
01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:29.520
I think maybe Facebook or people who haven't moved on to the other things and

1092
01:07:29.521 --> 01:07:30.930
they're still,
maybe they're just bitter that there,

1093
01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:35.040
but there's a guy who's just says his from English is,
has come to the UK,

1094
01:07:35.041 --> 01:07:37.230
you fucking loser.
And he's the first post.

1095
01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:40.300
He's the first guy to comment on everything I ever done.
Every time you post.

1096
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:42.480
So it's just the UK,
you fucking losers like

1097
01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:49.040
plane tickets to England for fucking six dudes to get like,
do,

1098
01:07:49.050 --> 01:07:51.840
do I have an audience there?
I don't know.
I mean,
no one.
Have you gotten the,
uh,

1099
01:07:51.870 --> 01:07:54.840
well how much would it cost to book you say that you're supposed to be like a

1100
01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:58.050
hundred bucks.
Like people sometimes I'll get,
how much does it cost?

1101
01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:00.510
I'll get a lot of those.
Just like,
you know,
just like,
you know,

1102
01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:03.150
how much does it cost for you to play my bachelor party?
I'm like,

1103
01:08:03.151 --> 01:08:06.390
talk to my fucking Pete.
Well I don't know,
negotiate that.
And they're always,

1104
01:08:06.391 --> 01:08:09.060
you know,
like jokingly,
but it doesn't come off as it,
you know,

1105
01:08:09.061 --> 01:08:12.180
it's like you can fuck my sister while you're there.
Cool.
And I'm like,
all right,

1106
01:08:12.181 --> 01:08:16.010
cool.
Well then,
then I'll take two grand off the right.
Right.
Now this is probably

1107
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:18.600
<v 4>an obvious question,
but you fuck her on the back of this?</v>

1108
01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:20.480
That was going to ask that.
Do you hook up?

1109
01:08:20.690 --> 01:08:23.090
<v 11>No,
those were all um,
I wanted to,</v>

1110
01:08:23.091 --> 01:08:26.720
I mean those were all Nashville models who,
um,

1111
01:08:27.410 --> 01:08:31.040
who fucking,
who were cool.
But um,
the insight,

1112
01:08:31.130 --> 01:08:34.670
well he could see better and yeah,
there's a poster that comes with a poster.
Oh,

1113
01:08:34.750 --> 01:08:37.520
that's cool.
Open it up.
There's a pussy king poster.

1114
01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:42.620
So we had these girls spelled WWE junior with their legs.

1115
01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:46.430
Wow.
And a couple of the girls complained that we showed their face.

1116
01:08:46.670 --> 01:08:49.850
They did complain.
Yeah.
But I think they only wanted to show there the crotch.

1117
01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:54.340
<v 4>Sure.
Now,
do you get any pushback from the religious communities?</v>

1118
01:08:54.341 --> 01:08:57.070
Because country music,
I mean we're talking that's a bible belt.

1119
01:08:57.580 --> 01:09:00.190
<v 11>Yeah.
Well I mean I don't know that I think I'm doing as antivert you know,</v>

1120
01:09:00.191 --> 01:09:03.610
is Pussy Anti Religion Nick?
I guess to some people.
I see what you're saying.

1121
01:09:03.611 --> 01:09:06.070
It's risky.
I mean,
yeah,
no I do get,

1122
01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:10.600
I mean if you were to go to my iTunes page it's like um oh wow.

1123
01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:15.220
It's five star.
It's wow,
it's a hundred and oh you got the big,
there's a big one.

1124
01:09:15.221 --> 01:09:20.220
If you guys want to take a look at that.
Yep.
See ww junior.
Yeah.

1125
01:09:20.330 --> 01:09:22.820
Yeah.
That's great.
It looks good.
And these girls were like,
I can,

1126
01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:24.430
you can see my face.
Yeah.

1127
01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:30.190
See I can see how that's offensive to women.
But to me it was sure it wasn't.

1128
01:09:30.370 --> 01:09:33.010
This is where I get in trouble cause to me I understand,

1129
01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:38.080
I understand how that's misogynistic just cause I'm just using them as letters.

1130
01:09:38.081 --> 01:09:40.630
But to me it's just like,
I thought it'd be cool to have them spell out my name.

1131
01:09:40.631 --> 01:09:41.400
I wasn't thinking like,

1132
01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:41.851
<v 4>yeah.
Well,</v>

1133
01:09:41.851 --> 01:09:44.790
you know what's interesting too is that in this day and age and feminism,

1134
01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:47.860
a lot of women are saying that this is empowerment,
right?
Like I,

1135
01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.980
I mean like a hot chick and don't call me a slut.

1136
01:09:50.010 --> 01:09:53.820
Like I can put my leg girl actually Instagram.
She's like her picture.
She's like,

1137
01:09:53.821 --> 01:09:57.210
I work.
She said I worked hard for this,
but it's really cool to see it.

1138
01:09:57.211 --> 01:10:00.310
And she was excited about it.
So I'm saying a lot of women see it.
They flip it a,

1139
01:10:00.330 --> 01:10:04.330
I don't know if I agree with it necessarily.
Maybe I just don't take anymore,

1140
01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:08.800
but I love vagina can read lyrics.
Yeah.
That's so cool.
Yeah,
I miss that.

1141
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:11.760
It's kind of a bummer that I spent that much time on the hard work that no one's

1142
01:10:11.761 --> 01:10:14.490
going to see.
That's why I like to bring it.
No,
that's awesome man.

1143
01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:18.720
You know what I like to the attention to the pussy details.
If you look,

1144
01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:23.860
there's a lot lotta camel toe and then you can actually see like some vantage,

1145
01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:28.470
oh yeah.
At her lips right here.
You can see,
oh,
I didn't even fucking notice it,

1146
01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:32.070
but what about right here?
Look at the last one's lips.
The machine.
Hold on,

1147
01:10:32.071 --> 01:10:34.620
let me see.
Let me look at this.
Cool.
Yeah.
Look at the last two.

1148
01:10:34.770 --> 01:10:39.270
[inaudible] she just got drilled one girling one,
one of the girls,

1149
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:43.980
her boob was popping out.
We had to fix it in Photoshop.
I thought,
oof,

1150
01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.740
you didn't,
you didn't,
um,
get it.

1151
01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:49.440
<v 11>I don't know these,
these girls,</v>

1152
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:53.310
I don't know how they found five girls in Nashville who didn't know the fuck I

1153
01:10:53.311 --> 01:10:56.780
was,
but I've never seen five girls that less interested in me than those groups.

1154
01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:57.990
Really?
Yeah.

1155
01:10:59.150 --> 01:11:02.330
<v 4>No,
they,
I mean,
how can that be though?
I don't know.
I was like,</v>

1156
01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:06.800
what's it like being a country?
Like what's it like being a musician?

1157
01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:09.290
And I know you're going to be honest about it.
Well,

1158
01:11:09.291 --> 01:11:12.050
you're going to shows people are there to see you.

1159
01:11:12.230 --> 01:11:15.090
You're singing songs excited about,
I think you're meeting the girls out.
I mean,

1160
01:11:15.091 --> 01:11:16.170
they must go nuts.
Yeah.

1161
01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:19.740
<v 11>Yeah.
Well,
it's Kinda what I sing about on the new record.</v>

1162
01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:23.110
The new one's called old wheeler just because,
because I'm tall,

1163
01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:27.130
I feel like an old man and like,
why are you laughing?
Was it that was,

1164
01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:28.740
that was too obvious of a plug?

1165
01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:33.550
<v 4>No,
it's such a,
you know,
oh,
I'm not,
the country world is,</v>

1166
01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:40.120
you're from La,
grew up here.
I'm just,
I just,
uh,
for me it's funny because silly,

1167
01:11:40.270 --> 01:11:43.590
I've just been around the south so much and spent so much time.
I mean,

1168
01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:46.810
I lived in Florida and Carolina,
it's just like,
here's the old eight years old.

1169
01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:50.370
<v 11>Yeah,
well there's,
there's,
I'm a huge Waylon Jennings fan and there was,</v>

1170
01:11:50.371 --> 01:11:53.750
and there's a Waylon album called old Waylon,
so I'm just like,
oh,

1171
01:11:53.751 --> 01:11:56.840
playing off that,
all the,
the old,
um,
uh,

1172
01:11:58.930 --> 01:12:02.980
you know,
like really the album was just about my last year on the,
it was like,

1173
01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:04.680
<v 13>okay.</v>

1174
01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:05.940
<v 11>And I was talking about it before.
I'm just,</v>

1175
01:12:05.941 --> 01:12:09.480
I feel like I'm just getting gray in my beard and like,

1176
01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:12.660
you're meeting these girls who are snapchat,
Insta,
you know,

1177
01:12:12.810 --> 01:12:15.320
instagramming you naked pics on the DM.
And like,

1178
01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:17.370
I just don't know that like trying to figure out that like,

1179
01:12:17.371 --> 01:12:20.330
I feel like I'm a man at a time almost,
you know,
like I've,

1180
01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:24.360
I've considered myself,
although you wouldn't tell it by the pussy king poster,

1181
01:12:24.361 --> 01:12:29.040
like an old style southern gentlemen as much as the guy who thinks pussy king

1182
01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:29.791
can say that.

1183
01:12:29.791 --> 01:12:33.300
And then it's like you meet a girl and she'll just fucking text you or Twat,

1184
01:12:33.301 --> 01:12:36.380
you know,
it's like,
it's crazy.
So here it's like so weird for me.
Like,

1185
01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:41.420
cause I'm at the age of when seeing a naked girl on a playboy was the biggest

1186
01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:43.920
fucking deal you could think of.
I'm the same.
Yeah.

1187
01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:47.920
And now girls will send you like basically,
you know,
um,

1188
01:12:49.170 --> 01:12:49.920
<v 13>okay.</v>

1189
01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:53.100
<v 11>I don't like ob Gyn fucking video.</v>

1190
01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:55.610
<v 4>They expect you to send your Dick Pic Tina</v>

1191
01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:58.650
<v 11>and I won't,
I won't do it.
Yeah,
why not?
You won't.
Cause I don't want it to,</v>

1192
01:12:58.651 --> 01:12:59.484
it's just,
dude,

1193
01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:03.630
<v 4>that has never happened to me.
No one's ever texted me,
um,</v>

1194
01:13:04.090 --> 01:13:06.050
uh,
fuzzy pictures or anything.

1195
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:10.340
But I always think that like if I were on the market these days,

1196
01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:13.350
one thing I would never do is text my dick.
Hell now.

1197
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:15.090
<v 11>Yeah.
Because all my buddies are like,</v>

1198
01:13:15.091 --> 01:13:16.650
well you don't put your face in it then it's fine.

1199
01:13:16.651 --> 01:13:19.670
It's like that doesn't mean anything.
It doesn't,
if the,
if,
if a,

1200
01:13:19.690 --> 01:13:24.480
if a picture also I'm a grower not a show or as they say.

1201
01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:28.350
Sure.
Cause I know Ari was in here before last week and you said he had enormous

1202
01:13:28.351 --> 01:13:32.370
balls.
I also feel like I'm a grower with my balls to demand those grow.
Yeah.

1203
01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:34.000
I mean they don't actually grow,
but then you know,

1204
01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:37.320
you can find me on the wrong day and it'll look like a fucking baby.

1205
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:41.480
<v 4>Yeah.
I'm,
I'm that too.
And then I like,
his boss was so dang,</v>

1206
01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:45.970
but you've got really nice.
Awesome.
Those are exemplary.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1207
01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:51.300
But Dick was,
it's,
it's real.
Like last week I did a trim,
you know,

1208
01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:54.500
on the hair and it was just like,
it'd been a few days and you're like,
Whoa,

1209
01:13:54.501 --> 01:13:56.770
you're hot.
Looks different today.
Yeah.
But Da,

1210
01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:59.810
I noticed the operative thing is it looked different that day.

1211
01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:01.130
It's not like that every day.

1212
01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:04.010
<v 11>Well,
I mean,
like my new thing is trying to,</v>

1213
01:14:04.011 --> 01:14:07.100
getting ready for this tour we got coming up.
I've been exercising and running.

1214
01:14:07.101 --> 01:14:10.310
Like when I run my Dick's like this people can't stay on the podcast.

1215
01:14:10.311 --> 01:14:13.750
I'm holding two fingers very clear when I run my Dick fucking shrivels up.
Yeah.

1216
01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:15.790
So,
but then someone just wants a dick pic.

1217
01:14:15.791 --> 01:14:19.090
I don't want to sit there for 10 hours getting ready and jacking off and like to

1218
01:14:19.091 --> 01:14:22.450
look awesome.
Sure.
Yeah,
I did.
I also want to see,

1219
01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:25.780
I also want to see the tits in the post.
Sure,
sure,
sure.
Do you have,

1220
01:14:25.781 --> 01:14:27.880
is there anyone that you're dating or anything?
I'm seeing,

1221
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:32.140
I'm seeing somebody right now in,
in,
uh,
in Nashville who,
um,

1222
01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:34.210
do you know this podcast?

1223
01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:40.910
And it's been a problem of mine and I'm super hyper focused on right now because

1224
01:14:41.201 --> 01:14:45.250
the guide the other day texted tweeted me that I can't finish a complete,

1225
01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:48.040
I was on Rogan.
I didn't finish one complete sentence.
And now it's in my head.

1226
01:14:48.041 --> 01:14:50.740
So I'm no,
I got it.
I'm talking all over the place.
But yeah,

1227
01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:55.150
I was on this podcast called,
uh,
guys,
we fucked.
Do you know that pod?
Oh yeah,

1228
01:14:55.151 --> 01:14:56.800
I've heard of it.
It's popular.
It's very popular.
Yeah.

1229
01:14:57.010 --> 01:15:01.780
I did some promo in New York and they had,
they'd emailed me,
my people last year,

1230
01:15:01.781 --> 01:15:03.910
they wanted to use some of my songs and their podcasts.
I'm like,
yeah,

1231
01:15:03.911 --> 01:15:07.060
sounds good.
Like it next time you're in New York,
just come and do the podcast.

1232
01:15:07.061 --> 01:15:10.660
And um,
it's just this real,
it's a really cool podcast with these two girls.

1233
01:15:10.661 --> 01:15:13.450
Just talk like kind of nasty.
Yeah.
You know,
sex,

1234
01:15:13.451 --> 01:15:16.270
talk about their real experiences or what's yeah.
Which it's almost like,

1235
01:15:16.271 --> 01:15:18.510
you know what guys do all the time,
but they do it and it's really cool.

1236
01:15:18.610 --> 01:15:22.330
It's really cool.
I think empowering to me,
that to me that's empowering.

1237
01:15:22.331 --> 01:15:26.200
Talking about,
you know,
they call it the anti slut shaming podcast.

1238
01:15:26.530 --> 01:15:28.810
And I went on it and I told a bunch of details

1239
01:15:30.670 --> 01:15:34.190
and my lady friend was none too happy about that.
Sure.
And so,

1240
01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:39.280
so to keep her from it,
I said I'd refer to as a girl.
I used to see,

1241
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:43.160
oh boy.
So which I thought was helping the situation,
right?

1242
01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:45.880
Because I was like an old story.
Yes.
So,

1243
01:15:45.881 --> 01:15:48.700
so if people saw me out in Nashville with this girl,
they wouldn't be like,
oh,

1244
01:15:48.701 --> 01:15:50.470
I heard you talking about the sock stories with her.

1245
01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:54.040
I thought it was protecting her and it actually was a double whammy when number

1246
01:15:54.041 --> 01:15:57.550
one,
I was talking explicit shit about her.
Yeah.
And also too,

1247
01:15:57.551 --> 01:16:02.290
I was saying on a podcast that I wasn't seeing her anymore.
Right.

1248
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:06.880
So it fun.
So I got to,
I'm trying to watch what I say now on on podcasts.
No,

1249
01:16:06.881 --> 01:16:09.730
that's all good,
man.
Yeah,
I mean I think you did it.
You were,

1250
01:16:09.731 --> 01:16:12.430
you had the good intention.
Well also too,
you get those,

1251
01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:16.350
you forget how big these fucking podcast like,
yeah.
The reason I say,

1252
01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:20.310
and not to be rude to her,
but I was just like,
there's no way she's ever been.

1253
01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.450
I mean,
there's 8 million podcasts.
Why would you listen to this one?

1254
01:16:22.451 --> 01:16:26.070
That makes sense.
Then she did and she's smart and she likes hearing

1255
01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:28.770
<v 4>what class you were,
you were on a podcast with like either,</v>

1256
01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:30.150
I don't know what those girls look like,

1257
01:16:30.151 --> 01:16:33.000
but they're probably like two hot chicks,
right?
Yeah.
Not Banging dudes.

1258
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:35.140
So of course your lady's going to be like,
um,

1259
01:16:35.170 --> 01:16:37.740
what is it you were saying you would listen to if I was oh yeah,
I'd be like,

1260
01:16:37.741 --> 01:16:40.680
first of all,
you're not doing that show.
And then secondly,

1261
01:16:41.150 --> 01:16:45.360
what you talking about with those sleds?
Yeah,
I'm sure they're lovely.

1262
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:46.700
I don't even know them or they kind of mix.

1263
01:16:47.290 --> 01:16:52.080
<v 11>Uh,
I think so.
Yeah.
Um,
but yeah,
you should.
Um,
I don't want to,</v>

1264
01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:53.470
I'd rather plug my album in there.

1265
01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:57.960
<v 4>Yeah.
Play some of his new album.
Is that allowed?
You're</v>

1266
01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:02.100
<v 11>a,
if you want to,
here's one thing,
which is why I'm,</v>

1267
01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:05.760
who I am is my independence,
which is whether you want to play it or not.

1268
01:17:05.761 --> 01:17:09.800
Just to let you know,
I owned my masters,
I owned my song,
you know,
like

1269
01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.540
it was an important thing for me to own everything.
So like,
yeah,

1270
01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:18.890
if some kind of shitty come,
you know,
Burger company wants to use my,
you know,

1271
01:17:19.370 --> 01:17:22.550
Carl's junior wants to play,
fuck you bitch while still needs a burger.

1272
01:17:22.551 --> 01:17:25.340
I can say no.
Like I literally own it like I can,

1273
01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:27.890
and I've had this before too.

1274
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:31.880
Friends want to use it for a thing here or there and I just say go,
you know,

1275
01:17:32.130 --> 01:17:34.580
I know they don't have money.
If it's just like a podcast,
I'll just say two,

1276
01:17:34.581 --> 01:17:38.330
I won't get flagged if we play it on something,
she might get what's happened.

1277
01:17:38.331 --> 01:17:39.680
And that happened with Rogan before,

1278
01:17:39.681 --> 01:17:43.430
which is it gets flagged because of the distribution company.
But the flagging,

1279
01:17:43.431 --> 01:17:46.070
it doesn't matter that it's like,
because it comes back around to me and I say,

1280
01:17:46.290 --> 01:17:47.123
Oh let it go.

1281
01:17:47.230 --> 01:17:50.950
<v 0>Yeah.
Great.
Um,
yeah,
I mean you have a new album out.</v>

1282
01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:55.540
It's doing really well and the tour is going to kick off soon.

1283
01:17:56.110 --> 01:18:00.600
<v 11>Yeah.
Well when will this come out?
It just comes out a day or two.
Yeah.
Okay.</v>

1284
01:18:00.601 --> 01:18:02.110
So yeah,
probably a couple of weeks from now.

1285
01:18:02.111 --> 01:18:04.570
And I meant to text my manager to see what markets,

1286
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:08.260
it's weird to f is there a site to buy tickets though?
Yeah,
my website,

1287
01:18:08.290 --> 01:18:12.190
which is Wheeler Walker Jr com and then pride backslash tour,

1288
01:18:12.191 --> 01:18:16.450
I think for the tour dates had a fine,
well they don't really,

1289
01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.490
cause they tweet me.
Where are you playing on this tour?
No,

1290
01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:19.900
that Shit's ridiculous.
Yeah.

1291
01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:24.480
<v 0>I also get this,
um,
you know,
we'll plug that I'm in whatever,</v>

1292
01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:29.610
going to Philly.
Then the tweet comes in,
are you in Philly now?
And I go,
yeah.

1293
01:18:30.210 --> 01:18:33.690
Shows tonight.
Yes.
Where?
I'm like,
Dude,

1294
01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:37.630
<v 11>oh dude,
I'll set that.
It's like who,
what times open or go on.
Yeah.
And you know,</v>

1295
01:18:37.631 --> 01:18:41.300
it's like,
you know what time you go on.
It's like,
I don't want it.

1296
01:18:41.410 --> 01:18:44.620
Not only do I not like how fucking lazy are you would like also,

1297
01:18:44.621 --> 01:18:45.410
I want you to see though

1298
01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:49.030
<v 0>Google it.
Yeah.
And I know it's like,
just fucking,
come on,
look it up.
Now,</v>

1299
01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:51.590
is there a real problem with you and and Georgia,
Florida Line,

1300
01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:55.770
<v 11>Florida,
Georgia line?
I don't know the name.
I went,
I went after country group.</v>

1301
01:18:56.130 --> 01:18:58.860
Here's the big,
they're massive.
Massive for someone.

1302
01:18:59.310 --> 01:19:01.740
I like having Christina here because she's someone who doesn't know this world,

1303
01:19:01.741 --> 01:19:03.240
so I can just explain it really simply.

1304
01:19:03.810 --> 01:19:08.810
Country Music used to be really fucking good and then it became

1305
01:19:10.570 --> 01:19:14.320
white people pop music,
like the stuff that comes if,

1306
01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:17.800
if like if after this,
like if Tom Played You Florida,
Georgia line,

1307
01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:21.040
you would and told you that was a hit country song,

1308
01:19:21.041 --> 01:19:24.280
your mind would be fucking blown because it was like it doesn't,
it's just,

1309
01:19:24.670 --> 01:19:27.700
it's new kids on the block.
Right.
And that's like the number,

1310
01:19:27.701 --> 01:19:31.120
that'd be like a number one country song.
Yeah,
it's,
it's just,
it's just pop crap,

1311
01:19:31.121 --> 01:19:33.490
which is,
it's kind of,
someone described the other day I was,

1312
01:19:33.491 --> 01:19:35.500
because people are trying to do,
it's a big argument,

1313
01:19:35.501 --> 01:19:37.660
which I don't really give that much of a shit about,
but you know,

1314
01:19:37.661 --> 01:19:40.270
what is country music these days?
And one of my friends,

1315
01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:41.910
<v 13>okay,</v>

1316
01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:42.631
<v 11>her definition,</v>

1317
01:19:42.631 --> 01:19:45.450
which a friend told her it was just country music is now defined as just

1318
01:19:45.451 --> 01:19:48.380
whatever white people are listening to.
[inaudible] not a bad,

1319
01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:51.540
it's not a bad description,
which is they're actually taking,

1320
01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:55.380
cause you know the old cliche about like whatever's cool in New York or la is

1321
01:19:55.381 --> 01:19:58.740
like gets to the south,
you know,
10 years later.
Right.
And it's true in music too,

1322
01:19:58.741 --> 01:20:01.980
which is like a lot of these beats and all those sound like it's Kinda like hip

1323
01:20:01.981 --> 01:20:04.440
hop from like 10 or 15 years ago.
Yeah.
It's like,

1324
01:20:04.441 --> 01:20:06.990
it sounds like fucking MC hammer or milli Vanilli yeah.
Yeah.

1325
01:20:07.050 --> 01:20:08.040
And it's fucking garbage.

1326
01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:12.330
And so my thing was I'm going to play real country music and since I'm playing

1327
01:20:12.331 --> 01:20:13.164
real country,

1328
01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:15.530
no one's going to fucking play it anyway cause they the one real country.

1329
01:20:15.531 --> 01:20:18.090
So I may as well.
I might as well not censor my,

1330
01:20:18.330 --> 01:20:22.260
because everyone would want to sing dirty if they could hate the most and

1331
01:20:22.261 --> 01:20:26.100
country music right now.
Who's the worst?
It's not really hate.
But um,
the,

1332
01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:28.450
the worst artists are definitely Florida,
Georgia line.
There's just guys,

1333
01:20:28.451 --> 01:20:30.630
same hunt who um,

1334
01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:37.140
and I'm trying to get my words to good cause all these people,
by the way,

1335
01:20:37.170 --> 01:20:40.000
now that I'm on the charts,
they,
they don't come after me.
But there,

1336
01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:43.130
there are people being,
you know,
can you knock it off a little?
Really?
They'll,

1337
01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:45.560
they'll reach out about that.
I've had,
I've had a couple of people reach out.

1338
01:20:45.570 --> 01:20:47.970
None,
none of either these guys,
but I've met these people.

1339
01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:51.720
The problem is not a problem but they're not bad people.
You know,

1340
01:20:51.721 --> 01:20:52.554
you meet him there like,

1341
01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:56.010
like you probably have friends who are comics who are like super nice guys who

1342
01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:59.300
aren't fucking funny.
Right,
right,
right.
But what do you do?
But yeah,

1343
01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:03.200
there are like it was just here last week.
Oh yeah.
We know.

1344
01:21:03.210 --> 01:21:05.880
But I'm doing his thing cause I'm in town for the next week.

1345
01:21:05.881 --> 01:21:10.310
I'm doing a the punch drunk thing tomorrow.
What's that?
Sports podcast.
Yeah,

1346
01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.570
that'll be,
that'll be fun.
That'll be fun.
Yeah.

1347
01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:16.940
And I'm doing to kill Tony Tonight.
That's really fun.
Is that fun?
Really Fun.

1348
01:21:17.010 --> 01:21:17.880
Yeah.
I've really found,

1349
01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:21.570
and that's why I love doing this stuff is because radio is pretty much banned
me.

1350
01:21:22.290 --> 01:21:26.890
And it's almost like a big fuck you to just fuck you fuck this mainstream with
a,

1351
01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:29.560
with a lot of the podcasts like we're talking about,

1352
01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:34.240
you're reaching more people to,
oh that's a thing too is I um,
and I,

1353
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:37.830
and we talked about it before,
actually talked about it on Rogan,
which is,

1354
01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:39.870
and I've got the numbers to prove it.

1355
01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:43.410
Rogan's bigger than SNL if you're a musician for sure.

1356
01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:47.010
Like people don't understand like I'm going through the back door,
you know,

1357
01:21:47.011 --> 01:21:49.860
like yeah.
Cause when we put it out I was like fuck,
you know,

1358
01:21:49.861 --> 01:21:52.530
I can't get on the radio and then we won't even have me on the radio to

1359
01:21:52.531 --> 01:21:55.290
interview me without even play or even play or bleep it out.

1360
01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:59.490
You just built up just band.
Nobody even listens to terrestrial radio anymore.

1361
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:02.580
Some do,
some all market,

1362
01:22:02.581 --> 01:22:05.310
some genres still had country is a country has a business.

1363
01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:09.600
There's a lot of people who don't,
who have cassette players in their cars.

1364
01:22:09.690 --> 01:22:12.720
It's true and implicit to radio and go to Walmart to buy cds.

1365
01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:16.500
Do you have any relationship with Toby Keith?
Uh,
no,

1366
01:22:16.501 --> 01:22:19.890
but I heard a rumor that he wanted me to open a show,
but I didn't.

1367
01:22:20.370 --> 01:22:23.280
I don't know if they ever panned out.
Really.
That'd be,
I mean,

1368
01:22:23.281 --> 01:22:26.510
I know it didn't pan out,
but I don't know if you imagine like him,

1369
01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:31.410
I'm sure his draw is unreal.
Yeah.
For you to go out there and do the pussy king,

1370
01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:32.550
I'd love to do it,
but yeah,

1371
01:22:32.551 --> 01:22:35.460
I think that's the other problem too is we couldn't really,

1372
01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:39.300
we couldn't really tour until I could headline because no one would have me.
No,

1373
01:22:39.301 --> 01:22:43.440
I can open for anybody because a lot of these countries,
you know like Toby,
Toby,

1374
01:22:43.441 --> 01:22:46.110
Keith,
it'd be parents and the two little girls or something.

1375
01:22:46.111 --> 01:22:50.290
I can't sing that doesn't Toby Keith have a rib place.
He has a restaurant.
Yeah.

1376
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:52.380
Toby Keith.
I love these ribs or something.

1377
01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:56.730
Red,
white and blue.

1378
01:22:56.731 --> 01:23:00.910
I love these ribs and yet here he had an album called shock and y'all

1379
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:05.530
Florida,
Georgia line just opened up a restaurant in Nashville,
which is,

1380
01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:07.120
I can only imagine.
I mean if their foods,

1381
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:09.490
if they're foods twice as good as their music,
it's still shit.

1382
01:23:11.290 --> 01:23:15.520
Now will you be opening a pussy king restaurant and we're doing it.

1383
01:23:15.550 --> 01:23:17.000
We're doing a pussy,
pussy cat.

1384
01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:21.310
I actually just reached out to the two of these guys who make pocket pussies to

1385
01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:23.040
see if they wanted to make a special wheel.

1386
01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:26.090
Can I pull up the video that you can play?

1387
01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:30.700
That video is really great.
You're going to do a pocket pussy,
do you?

1388
01:23:30.701 --> 01:23:35.650
But nothing for a restaurant or food.
No,
I ain't got that kind of cash yet.

1389
01:23:35.651 --> 01:23:38.470
I got it right.
I mean once I can.
Yeah.
I mean it's,
we're doing the whole,

1390
01:23:38.471 --> 01:23:43.090
we're doing the vivo one.
Is that the one to play?
Yeah.
Which,
which,
which song?

1391
01:23:43.091 --> 01:23:46.750
Which one you're talking about posted king.
Yeah.
Is that the is,
hold on,

1392
01:23:46.751 --> 01:23:51.400
I'll show you.
Is it better to play this one?
Oh,
you're vivo channel.
Yeah,

1393
01:23:51.401 --> 01:23:54.610
that's the real one.
That's the real one.
Okay.
You're really kind of an outlaw

1394
01:23:55.350 --> 01:24:00.180
<v 9>country music.
I mean this video is great.
The song is great.</v>

1395
01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:02.040
I love

1396
01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:12.150
some of the vocals are really,

1397
01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:15.820
might be audio show him

1398
01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:22.930
fishing in Austin is

1399
01:24:26.230 --> 01:24:29.080
when one watches one pounds a y

1400
01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:34.340
legs.
Oh performing.

1401
01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:41.980
Thanks.
Anal doesn't count.

1402
01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:45.860
Dick still taste.

1403
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:55.100
All the pain is drop down

1404
01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:10.890
so you could get into this kind of,
I like it.
I like it.
It's honest.

1405
01:25:11.010 --> 01:25:13.740
It's real kind of like bullshit.

1406
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:16.080
I my my dark when I was on that when I was on the road,

1407
01:25:16.081 --> 01:25:19.830
he got girls ask me all the time,
I'm like,
maybe I am the pussy king.
You know?

1408
01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:24.660
Do you get a lot of push back off from the women's groups and stuff?
If we not,

1409
01:25:24.810 --> 01:25:28.800
is her mouth to the smart Limon to kind of get it and the fun of it.

1410
01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:33.830
But yes,
I do
mean

1411
01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:40.130
next year when his daughter gonna turn.
I bet your show is fun,
man.

1412
01:25:40.131 --> 01:25:44.400
That I'd like to see what's live.
Yeah,
a lot of towns.
That's awesome.

1413
01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:50.760
Place to work.
My good guy.
He did this video,

1414
01:25:50.761 --> 01:25:54.390
his pants and his name is Cameron Crowe,
but not that one.
Are you being serious?

1415
01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:58.910
Yeah.
Yeah.
It doesn't have an ego.

1416
01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:03.930
It's a great video.
And he did a great job with that.

1417
01:26:09.170 --> 01:26:11.550
Really great graphics.
Yeah.

1418
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:16.850
It's like Rogan.
There

1419
01:26:22.050 --> 01:26:26.260
is a great singer like that.
Yes.

1420
01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:34.580
Wow.
The best way I would describe it as good.

1421
01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:37.670
It just feels like a throwback to real country music.
Well that,

1422
01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:40.970
well this one is this song especially,
which is,
you know,
I was here all that,

1423
01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:44.170
like I said,
kind of shitty white boy rap on the radio.
I'm,
yeah,

1424
01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:47.300
let's do the old kind of like Jerry Reed kind of country funk shit.

1425
01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:49.340
So you grew up,
did you grow up in Nashville?

1426
01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:52.260
I grew up in Kentucky and my thought,
my mom and all my family's from that.

1427
01:26:52.970 --> 01:26:56.300
So it's really strange right now,
which is,
I don't know if you guys know,

1428
01:26:56.301 --> 01:27:00.360
but Nashville is like the hit the city in the world and it's cool.
My last,

1429
01:27:00.570 --> 01:27:04.940
you know,
as a kid,
I knew it as a kid when it was like a fucking ghost town.
Yeah.

1430
01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:09.500
And now the rent's fucking crazy.
It's like,
since I've been a kid,

1431
01:27:09.501 --> 01:27:12.220
it's become this like super hip place and I can barely afford to live there.

1432
01:27:12.230 --> 01:27:15.320
I got a buddy there.
Um,
I can't believe,
I'm sorry,

1433
01:27:15.321 --> 01:27:19.790
I'm still blown away that you're not getting laid every night
at the shows me.

1434
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.890
Why do I do okay?
I do.
Okay.
Secret

1435
01:27:22.890 --> 01:27:23.071
<v 11>is,</v>

1436
01:27:23.071 --> 01:27:26.070
I was talking to a buddy of mine the other day just about this as secret as to

1437
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:29.130
party between tours.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1438
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:32.130
So going around Nash,
I mean,
it's easier.

1439
01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:35.360
I can meet girls in Nashville going out to bars and stuff.
Right.

1440
01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:40.210
Why meet one and fucking Boise when it's just some random girl who was like,

1441
01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:42.990
you got to get through that tour,
which is also work.

1442
01:27:42.991 --> 01:27:46.520
You've got to have stamina to get through it.
Yeah.
I need more stand in my,

1443
01:27:46.610 --> 01:27:48.750
because of the last tour I um,

1444
01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:53.850
I went a little too crazy and not a joke.
I put myself in the hospital for real.

1445
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:55.470
Yeah.
At the tour ended and I was,

1446
01:27:57.210 --> 01:27:59.280
and what happened was I am the tour,

1447
01:27:59.281 --> 01:28:02.670
I ended up in La and it's kind of a secret,

1448
01:28:02.671 --> 01:28:05.820
but I don't really give a shit anymore,
which is why we're doing a TV special.

1449
01:28:06.650 --> 01:28:08.160
And I'm torn it in La.

1450
01:28:08.161 --> 01:28:11.940
I had some meetings about this wheeler Walker Jr TV special and we were in this

1451
01:28:11.941 --> 01:28:15.420
big fancy Hollywood building or wherever it was,
Beverly hills.

1452
01:28:16.140 --> 01:28:19.410
And the tour ended the night before and I barfed on myself in the fucking

1453
01:28:19.411 --> 01:28:23.190
meeting with all these suits there and almost lost the show because I think they

1454
01:28:23.191 --> 01:28:25.140
thought I was on heroin or drugs or some shit.

1455
01:28:25.190 --> 01:28:29.430
But I was really just exhausted from tea.
I went too hard on the tour.

1456
01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:33.060
I'm with you,
dude.
I know exactly what you're talking about.
Okay,
cool.
Yeah,

1457
01:28:33.061 --> 01:28:36.630
it was,
cause it was,
it was really,
so what happened was I called,
um,

1458
01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:41.190
I called my family and just like,
you know,
I'm sick,
so give me,

1459
01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:42.390
leave me alone for a couple of days.

1460
01:28:42.391 --> 01:28:47.160
And I went back to the hotel and 48 hours later,
or no,

1461
01:28:47.161 --> 01:28:48.420
I think it was 24 hours later,

1462
01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:52.290
I heard banging on the door and they were about to break down the door.

1463
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:56.850
They had the tour manager come over and they hadn't heard from me for what

1464
01:28:56.851 --> 01:29:01.170
happened was I passed out,
I was so exhausted from the tour and I was so sick.

1465
01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:05.220
I didn't wake up for 24 hours.
They were about to bust down the hotel,
you know,

1466
01:29:05.230 --> 01:29:06.450
had to,
I had the whole thing locked.

1467
01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:09.870
They were about to bust on the hotel room door and then they had to take me to

1468
01:29:09.871 --> 01:29:12.120
the hospital and like put the Ivs in and all my street

1469
01:29:12.730 --> 01:29:16.740
<v 0>when I,
I haven't had it like that.
But I would say even without partying,</v>

1470
01:29:16.741 --> 01:29:21.450
cause I'm not a big party guy.
I've had a tour where,

1471
01:29:21.890 --> 01:29:25.950
you know,
it was a different city every night for five nights a week,

1472
01:29:25.951 --> 01:29:29.190
three weeks in a row,
one week off,
then back to three weeks in a row.

1473
01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:33.120
And at the end of like the third month of that I just fully broke down and got

1474
01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:34.380
like really sick,
you know?

1475
01:29:34.570 --> 01:29:37.480
<v 11>Yeah.
And I think too,
I was from my friends are talking about,
I think there was,</v>

1476
01:29:38.050 --> 01:29:42.430
although I don't want to admit it was probably a mental uh sure.
You know,

1477
01:29:42.431 --> 01:29:45.820
part of it too,
which was just like emotionally and physically,

1478
01:29:45.850 --> 01:29:48.970
just everything was just drained.
And then,
you know,
like they filled me up with,

1479
01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:53.890
with fluids at the,
at the emergency room and I guess it helped,
but I still,

1480
01:29:53.891 --> 01:29:57.800
I mean it took two weeks for me to really kind of be yet touring actually

1481
01:29:57.870 --> 01:30:02.340
<v 0>the most people and I was one of these people whenever you heard about like big</v>

1482
01:30:02.341 --> 01:30:06.480
stars.
Yeah.
Sound like you're like,
you're like,
that sounds like bullshit.

1483
01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:09.870
Like they suffering from exhaustion and then if you actually tour,

1484
01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:13.830
it's the one thing that when you,
you see it on the news with somebody,

1485
01:30:14.010 --> 01:30:17.070
you start to have empathy for it.
You're like,
oh yeah,
that person,
I believe that.

1486
01:30:17.110 --> 01:30:18.510
Like they're actually really good.

1487
01:30:18.750 --> 01:30:21.500
<v 11>And you hear about those fuckers.
Like,
let's say Garth Brooks for example,</v>

1488
01:30:21.501 --> 01:30:26.330
who I heard,
and I can't say this for a fact,
but I'm pretty sure I'm right.

1489
01:30:26.331 --> 01:30:29.630
Someone told me,
you know,
he has that Vegas residency and he wants to,

1490
01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:32.210
but he wants to sleep at home.
So he walks out of the bay,

1491
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:35.150
the GIG and gets on a private plane and they fly him back to wherever you live

1492
01:30:35.151 --> 01:30:38.680
in Oklahoma.
He doesn't sleep.
He has,
there's,
there's,

1493
01:30:38.810 --> 01:30:42.740
there's artists at that level now,
you know,
which fair to say?

1494
01:30:42.741 --> 01:30:46.850
I'm pretty fucking far from that.
Who Do tours where they,

1495
01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:50.360
they just sleep,
sleep in their own place every night they walk,

1496
01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:52.400
they walk out the back of the arena.

1497
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:57.220
<v 0>If you're that rich.
Yeah,
why not?
So I felt it had that thing where,
so he,</v>

1498
01:30:57.330 --> 01:30:58.350
he got an offer,

1499
01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:03.120
he was in an interview saying that he got an offer to do a private gig in The

1500
01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:07.410
Bahamas,
but for like super wealthy people,
but for like 10 people.

1501
01:31:08.010 --> 01:31:11.700
And so the,
the,
the,
you know,

1502
01:31:11.701 --> 01:31:15.330
what he required was,
you know,
obviously extraordinary amount of money,

1503
01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:20.250
he would not mingle pre show.
That's imperative.

1504
01:31:20.490 --> 01:31:25.170
Flew in the end.
He's like,
it has to be set up like this.
They introduced him,

1505
01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:26.940
he came in,
he did the show,

1506
01:31:27.210 --> 01:31:31.190
walked out and flew back from The Bahamas to lower for 10 people.
Yeah.

1507
01:31:31.710 --> 01:31:33.380
But it was for,
you know,
probably seven figures.

1508
01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:36.710
<v 11>I mean that's the only,
sometimes those are the like I'll get it like a,
you know,</v>

1509
01:31:36.711 --> 01:31:40.540
a bachelor party or somewhere private party that'll pay for the rest of the
tour.

1510
01:31:42.130 --> 01:31:44.200
Touring is so fucking,
it's with a band.
It's,

1511
01:31:44.770 --> 01:31:47.760
I bet you at a bachelor party would probably be a really fun,
yeah,

1512
01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:50.920
you'd be a great act,
but not to act to diva.

1513
01:31:50.921 --> 01:31:52.810
But we do have to have my people tell him like,
you know,

1514
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:55.680
he ain't going to the titty bar with you afterwards.
You know what?

1515
01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:58.460
I don't want to do that.
I want to hang out with you all night.
Yeah.

1516
01:31:58.810 --> 01:32:02.640
You're buying my friendship.
Right.
Um,
cause that's too expensive.

1517
01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:05.920
Sex M uh,
we live inside studio g were,

1518
01:32:05.930 --> 01:32:08.350
where's the G Douche bag?

1519
01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:13.540
She's welcome to insight studio g where music is first here and he's acting like

1520
01:32:13.541 --> 01:32:15.350
he's not a billion.
Really cool.
Right.

1521
01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:17.290
Because that's what I was going to say before was,
so I had to,

1522
01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:20.380
when I had the first record,
I was kind of shopping around.
I did meet at,

1523
01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:25.370
at a capitol records.
It didn't take the w nothing against them,
but it,
it was,

1524
01:32:25.371 --> 01:32:28.060
it would have been the completely wrong place to do it because they don't know

1525
01:32:28.061 --> 01:32:32.470
how to market it or they,
you know,
their thing is to go to radio,

1526
01:32:32.471 --> 01:32:35.470
go to MTV,
all the Shit I couldn't do.
But it was nice to know to meet with me.

1527
01:32:35.471 --> 01:32:38.260
Nice dudes.
But I was in the lobby and the lobby,
they had

1528
01:32:40.290 --> 01:32:43.570
all,
every capital album that had gone,
you know what diamond is?

1529
01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:46.390
Diamond know platinum is million copies.
Right.
And diamond,

1530
01:32:46.391 --> 01:32:49.360
they have this new thing called diamond,
which is 10 million,
10 million.

1531
01:32:49.570 --> 01:32:50.403
So they had,
they had,

1532
01:32:50.410 --> 01:32:55.300
they had a plaque of every diamond album the capital ever put out,
which was,

1533
01:32:56.210 --> 01:32:58.150
it literally was,
it was like dark side of the moon.

1534
01:32:58.151 --> 01:33:01.390
And then every Beatles album and pretty much every Garth Brooks album.
Wow.

1535
01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:03.340
And then you think about the Beatles,
which is like,
you know,

1536
01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:05.790
back in the old days and there's four of them.
It's Garth Brooks,

1537
01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:09.760
just fucking ham.
And he had like fucking 10 of these.
That's crazy man.

1538
01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:14.290
I mean this guy has got more,
he played uh,
uh Rupp arena,

1539
01:33:14.291 --> 01:33:17.770
which is a big arena where my hometown,
that's 23,000.

1540
01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:20.530
He played two sold out shows there in one night.

1541
01:33:21.250 --> 01:33:26.080
<v 0>Jesus.
Okay.
Earlier this year I did a Gig in Edmonton at a theater.</v>

1542
01:33:26.890 --> 01:33:31.890
I was there the same week as him and he was doing wherever the Oilers play,

1543
01:33:34.990 --> 01:33:39.230
which is about 20,000.
He did nine,
oh my God.

1544
01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:43.360
Out,
I think its Rogers arena or something.
Pretty good.

1545
01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:45.990
<v 11>That's the thing is that if you're that popular,</v>

1546
01:33:45.991 --> 01:33:48.770
you've got to be so detached from is,

1547
01:33:50.220 --> 01:33:53.040
I think he's proving here that he's detached.
Yeah.
But he's trying,

1548
01:33:53.070 --> 01:33:56.100
that's the thing.
He's trying to show you that I'm not,
but he's also,

1549
01:33:56.130 --> 01:33:58.170
don't forget he's,
he's actually not,

1550
01:33:58.460 --> 01:34:00.690
I mean he still sells tickets like a motherfucker,

1551
01:34:00.691 --> 01:34:03.730
but he's also not adapting well with this new world.
You know,

1552
01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:08.460
Shit's not on iTunes.
It's not on Spotify.
Why he it?
He thinks it's a rip off.

1553
01:34:08.461 --> 01:34:13.080
And he,
he the rip off to them?
To him?
No,
him.
Oh,
oh.
I mean,

1554
01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:15.150
I don't know what the specific things are.
He's like,

1555
01:34:15.810 --> 01:34:19.830
he wanted an iTunes is what I heard was he wanted iTunes to not have the ability

1556
01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:22.260
he's,
he's like their albums or pieces of work.
Yeah,
you can't,

1557
01:34:22.290 --> 01:34:26.940
I don't want you to be able to sell single tracks.
Oh,
he's,
oh,
I do just like,

1558
01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:31.320
couldn't he do like album only sales then they,
they were like,

1559
01:34:31.321 --> 01:34:34.110
that's not what what we do here and yeah,
and his,
his,
I think he was just like,

1560
01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:37.620
well,
I'm Garth Brooks.
I make the rules in like,
yeah,
we're,
we're apple.
No,
no,

1561
01:34:37.621 --> 01:34:41.780
you don't.
Or how does he sell his albums?
And he actually tried to a,

1562
01:34:41.790 --> 01:34:44.880
this is how dumb he is.
He,
he um,
he,

1563
01:34:44.881 --> 01:34:48.970
he had built a website where he actually,
I'm making the war the term up,

1564
01:34:48.971 --> 01:34:52.560
but like instead of mp3s,
they were like Garth p threes.
But I'm,

1565
01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:55.080
but I'm making that up.
But Two p threes.
Yeah.

1566
01:34:55.110 --> 01:34:59.180
But it was GP yet he invented his format.
What?

1567
01:34:59.390 --> 01:35:03.440
Andy had his fans by it just directly from him.
Wow.

1568
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:04.580
But he just signed,

1569
01:35:04.850 --> 01:35:07.430
you can buy his music digitally and I'll give them a nice plug.

1570
01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:12.800
He just signed an exclusive e f the first co he's now you can buy his albums

1571
01:35:12.801 --> 01:35:16.050
digitally at Amazon.
Oh,
they let them do it.
So now if you,

1572
01:35:16.370 --> 01:35:18.180
a lot of these videos here,
these stupid shit,
there's,

1573
01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:21.200
you see Amazon logos behind him because he got his,
cause he's only,

1574
01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:22.640
he finally like,

1575
01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:26.080
we're talking about a guy who got into the digital music world like three
months.

1576
01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:29.340
<v 4>Yeah.
It literally social media.</v>

1577
01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:33.970
<v 11>Yeah.
I got and his new albums don't sell.
Huh?</v>

1578
01:35:34.610 --> 01:35:36.740
<v 14>Did he?
He was so angry.</v>

1579
01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:40.440
That's close down me happy birthday to you.

1580
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:47.010
<v 4>Yeah.
You see that by the way.
Okay.
Let me look at the rage on his face.</v>

1581
01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:50.760
Will knock happens.
Look at the rage.
And he's like,
is that supposed to happen?

1582
01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:51.623
Looking at them?
I got,

1583
01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:57.190
<v 11>it's like knocking on the fucking door when I'm doing my,</v>

1584
01:35:57.191 --> 01:36:01.100
and he probably watched it.
Still funny updates.
Is that supposed to happen?

1585
01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:06.223
<v 14>Yes,</v>

1586
01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:10.640
<v 11>thank God,
thank God.
Nothing unexpected happen.
And for that g alert,</v>

1587
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:16.110
so yeah,
it was good cause like my,
the arena and my hometown is 23,000.

1588
01:36:16.111 --> 01:36:18.020
That's crazy.
All Bet.
I'll bet he was just like,

1589
01:36:18.410 --> 01:36:21.560
I bet it's whoever runs this shit.
It's just like 23,000,

1590
01:36:21.561 --> 01:36:24.660
like that's not even worth our time.
So he's like,
we'll do to,

1591
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:28.760
cause some friends of mine when they said like the,
you know,
the stairway,

1592
01:36:28.761 --> 01:36:29.750
it's like he's got pet.

1593
01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:33.920
It was like congested because people leaving and coming in and he does a long

1594
01:36:33.921 --> 01:36:38.330
show too.
He's like,
the shows were 23,000 people,
two sold out shows,

1595
01:36:38.331 --> 01:36:40.380

Wow.
Jeez.

1596
01:36:40.830 --> 01:36:44.140

I don't think we have the drop where he's talking about.
Um,</v>

1597
01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:45.071
he's like,
you know,

1598
01:36:45.071 --> 01:36:48.990
people email me that like during the show they'll be looking at the,
the,

1599
01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:52.750
the guy doing the lighting and they're like,
oh God.
It's like,
yeah man.

1600
01:36:53.230 --> 01:36:56.410
I mean that's what people,
they get into everybody.
They're not just,

1601
01:36:56.411 --> 01:36:58.970
they're firm and they're looking at the lighting guy and they're living at that

1602
01:36:58.971 --> 01:37:02.110
session.
He's trying to give credit to the lighting guy,
the grip guy.

1603
01:37:02.111 --> 01:37:04.630
They get these,
these are the ones that are doing the work.

1604
01:37:04.631 --> 01:37:06.520
I'm not doing the work,
I'm just the front

1605
01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:08.320

Chop it up,

<v 11>Yeah.
That's like,
yeah,
he's the one really doing the work.</v>

1608
01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:18.890
The lighting man gets 30% know about

1609
01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:23.030
<v 4>man right here.
Are you a fan of,

What exactly?</v>

1610
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:28.600
Test?
Not really.
I mean,
I don't dislike him.
He actually had a shirt on,

1611
01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:31.170
but I think that would be,
that's kind of gaze and like,

1612
01:37:31.190 --> 01:37:32.570
can I just get a hit this year,

1613
01:37:32.571 --> 01:37:37.000
this past year book written by a friend of mine does a great song to me.

1614
01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:42.590
That's so weird.
That was,
that was weird.

1615
01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:45.820
<v 11>Yeah.
A friend of mine who I'm from playing a Gig with next week in Nashville,</v>

1616
01:37:45.821 --> 01:37:49.560
a charity Gig,
he just opened up for him and uh,

1617
01:37:49.650 --> 01:37:52.350
I saw a video of it on instinct.
I mean,
it's,
it's crazy.
It's like,

1618
01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:56.310
don't you feel like country music nowadays almost underground music,

1619
01:37:56.311 --> 01:38:00.390
like the big stars aren't like the real world.
Big Stars like,
yeah,
but they fill,

1620
01:38:00.630 --> 01:38:02.850
they fucking pack arenas wherever they can,
like arena,

1621
01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:07.440
but like these guys wouldn't hold a candle fame wise to like a Kim Kardashian or

1622
01:38:07.441 --> 01:38:09.630
Kanye or any of these guys.
You know?
It's like they're not in yet.

1623
01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:12.120
<v 3>Our Lady Gaga,
but they probably do as much right</v>

1624
01:38:12.150 --> 01:38:13.470
<v 11>business do they like,</v>

1625
01:38:14.170 --> 01:38:18.580
I'll bet Garth Brooks is 20 literally 20 to 50 times bigger than lady Gaga.

1626
01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:22.420
Lady Gaga is in the news.
All right.
Yeah.
Well they're white.

1627
01:38:22.421 --> 01:38:24.130
His teeth are those look good.

1628
01:38:24.131 --> 01:38:28.780
Like if Garth Brooks is said all those diamond records,
I mean Gaga,
Katy Perry,

1629
01:38:28.781 --> 01:38:30.820
they've never had a no.
Even half that,

1630
01:38:31.010 --> 01:38:34.560
<v 0>by the way,
nobody would ever allow what Katie correct.</v>

1631
01:38:35.310 --> 01:38:37.060
If it had been the reverse,
if it had been like a guy,

1632
01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:41.110
<v 3>just a touch.
I just,
can I just touch you?
Super Weird.
Tits look great.</v>

1633
01:38:41.111 --> 01:38:45.520
You mind if I just did?
Wow.
They are.
They're real natural.
Yeah.
Super Weird.

1634
01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:46.510
That is,
but you're right.

1635
01:38:46.511 --> 01:38:49.730
It is something that Garth didn't adapt to this digital era.
I mean,
lady,

1636
01:38:49.731 --> 01:38:53.860
well I knew his new album's called man versus machine help versus right there an

1637
01:38:53.861 --> 01:38:57.910
adversarial attitude towards social media.
Yeah,
the machine.
What's the machine?

1638
01:38:58.210 --> 01:38:58.750
Right.

1639
01:38:58.750 --> 01:39:03.660
Because Lady Lady gap swaps is on Twitter and she's got gazillion,
you know,

1640
01:39:03.670 --> 01:39:07.000
millennials and Garth didn't get that audience I guess.
Huh.

1641
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:09.820
<v 11>But not to be,
not to be on iTunes.
You're not in the game.</v>

1642
01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:14.720
Crazy not to be on Spotify.
Yeah.
Kids nowadays just make a Spotify playlist.

1643
01:39:14.810 --> 01:39:18.220
Right.
But yet to me,
he was kind of the turning point when everything turned,

1644
01:39:18.230 --> 01:39:21.620
because remember they used to hook his fat ass up to those fucking wires and he

1645
01:39:21.621 --> 01:39:25.190
would fly through the arena because that's not like Willie Nelson never did that

1646
01:39:25.191 --> 01:39:27.670
shit.
You know,
he tried to turn it into Bon Jovi.
Yeah.

1647
01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:31.560
So to me he was the first one to kind of turn country into self sacrifice.

1648
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:35.390
So do you think the Garth Brooks is responsible for the sucker fication of

1649
01:39:35.391 --> 01:39:38.210
country music?
He was the beginning of it.
I mean,
yeah,
in a weird way.

1650
01:39:38.211 --> 01:39:40.220
I mean now compared to the shit out there now,

1651
01:39:40.221 --> 01:39:43.570
he sounds like fucking woody Guthrie,
you know,
you sounds like,
you know,

1652
01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:46.340
he sounds old school compared to what's out there now.

1653
01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:49.940
But at the time I just remember being in high school in Kentucky and like you'd

1654
01:39:49.941 --> 01:39:51.920
walk into a room and the teachers and the kids together,

1655
01:39:51.921 --> 01:39:55.000
we're in friends in low places.
Like it was like glee or something like that.

1656
01:39:55.010 --> 01:39:56.530
She was the biggest fucking song in the world.

1657
01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:58.980
And I remember just hating those fucking songs.
Yeah.

1658
01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:02.840
And they just sign it because he come to town and you don't want to listen to

1659
01:40:02.841 --> 01:40:03.621
what your parents listened to.

1660
01:40:03.621 --> 01:40:06.010
My parents would go to the show and like aunts and uncles and like,

1661
01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:09.650
it was like more for parents.
I know you guys are lame.
It was like a little kid.

1662
01:40:09.651 --> 01:40:10.590
I don't want to go like that.

1663
01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:13.970
I was like little kids and parents were in Kentucky.
Was it?
Lexington?
Lexington,

1664
01:40:14.090 --> 01:40:16.790
which is a big city.
You know where I'm from.

1665
01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:20.170
<v 0>Yeah.
Um,
this is a,
by the way,
a super example,</v>

1666
01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:25.380
very clear of the dynamic that exists within like the country,

1667
01:40:25.630 --> 01:40:30.370
at least the popular country culture is this interviewer.
And you'll see like,

1668
01:40:30.690 --> 01:40:35.530
<v 11>Mary,
you are so beautiful.
Oh my God,
am I fell at Oklahoma Girl?
Yeah,
I wasn't,</v>

1669
01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:40.370
I was your age not too long ago.
Now people sit down.

1670
01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:43.310
Here's a question my Stuart Stuart's put on Sunday,
not to interrupt,
but like,

1671
01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:46.540
look at that role of woman.
Why is she the star?
You know,

1672
01:40:46.541 --> 01:40:49.210
what is her voice better than the rest of those girls?
Probably not,
but yeah,

1673
01:40:49.211 --> 01:40:53.020
you can tell by the faces which one gets to be the star,
right?
Right,
yeah,

1674
01:40:53.170 --> 01:40:54.003
sure can.

1675
01:40:54.450 --> 01:40:57.970
<v 15>Yeah.
Wait,
so who's this?
Who's this blonde?
Tall.
This is Carrie Underwood here.</v>

1676
01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.580
I don't know that other girl.
And then this one right here,
I don't know.

1677
01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:04.030
But obviously everybody knows her fry it a reality show.

1678
01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:06.100
Just tell me to take off my shorts,
shorts,

1679
01:41:06.101 --> 01:41:10.180
put on some normal jeans and get off the head of the car.
I mean,
that's just,

1680
01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:12.640
yeah,
that's just,
that's like slang.
I don't know what is that.

1681
01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:17.200
English is going to go in and see if there's of these people's faces.
Oh my gosh,

1682
01:41:17.210 --> 01:41:20.590
no perfect.
Just like my girls from Oklahoma,

1683
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:22.960
this is an arena.

1684
01:41:24.630 --> 01:41:28.780
<v 11>And People Watch that as entertainment now.
Humana from there she was like,</v>

1685
01:41:28.781 --> 01:41:32.670
all right y'all.
And now here's a wheeler walker jr with gray hair up my butt.

1686
01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:35.770
That's what I'm really trying.
That's what I'm getting on.

1687
01:41:35.771 --> 01:41:38.000
The charge is a big deal for me cause I like be like,

1688
01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:42.070
I like knowing that someone like that it's manager had to get up at that next on

1689
01:41:42.071 --> 01:41:44.620
Monday morning and go,
you're number 11.
Yeah,

1690
01:41:44.710 --> 01:41:49.270
well I'm not in the top 10 who's number 10
and they're like,

1691
01:41:49.770 --> 01:41:53.890
don't,
don't,
don't,
don't tell her,
you know?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Fuck.
You know.

1692
01:41:54.490 --> 01:41:56.740
So,
but I will say in fairness,

1693
01:41:56.741 --> 01:42:01.390
there's a lot of kind of big country artists who are fans and who would piss me

1694
01:42:01.391 --> 01:42:05.600
off too is like they call me or get to my good to me through their people and

1695
01:42:05.601 --> 01:42:08.680
you know,
fucking cause they want to look cool.
I love what you're doing.

1696
01:42:08.681 --> 01:42:12.100
So fucking bad ass.
And I'm like,
put on a fucking tee shirt,
tweet about it.

1697
01:42:12.101 --> 01:42:13.920
You know,
don't keep it to your fucking self.
You know?
It's like,

1698
01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:16.690
so you're cool thing to like say you're a fan of mine.
Right,
right.

1699
01:42:16.810 --> 01:42:19.720
But they don't want to lose scared.
They're scared to mention it.

1700
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:23.710
That's what the thing is.
I think that that fear exists more in country,

1701
01:42:24.010 --> 01:42:28.060
like other genres of music.
They wouldn't be a remember to that.
Uh,

1702
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:32.260
and if you haven't seen it,
I always recommend this movie,
this documentary,

1703
01:42:32.650 --> 01:42:35.620
the Dixie chicks.
I forget the title of the documentary about how they,

1704
01:42:35.621 --> 01:42:37.060
when they got banned from country music,

1705
01:42:37.061 --> 01:42:41.590
like they're still gone from country music.
People hate them still.
Yeah.

1706
01:42:41.591 --> 01:42:45.280
That's great.
Because they spoke out against the war,
the war,
which by the way,

1707
01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:49.930
right.
But is it Bush?
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I don't,
I don't,

1708
01:42:49.931 --> 01:42:52.400
I don't want to get political,
but that's what Trump ran on is,

1709
01:42:52.401 --> 01:42:54.880
which is what they said.
Wow.
You know?

1710
01:42:54.910 --> 01:42:58.420
So what they're saying is what everyone does now agrees with and they still

1711
01:42:58.421 --> 01:43:02.810
can't come back.
You brought your guitar.
Would you mind playing a song?
Yeah.
Okay.

1712
01:43:03.340 --> 01:43:05.470
Why don't I play,
here's what I want to play because,
well,

1713
01:43:05.471 --> 01:43:08.350
I want to preface it by saying something.
I don't know if you guys knew this.

1714
01:43:08.351 --> 01:43:11.110
It's kind of a big deal.
I blew up on black Twitter two weeks ago.

1715
01:43:11.111 --> 01:43:13.060
You know what that is?
Black Twitter.
Yeah,
sure.

1716
01:43:13.570 --> 01:43:16.540
So I have a song from the first record called fuck you bitch.
Yeah.

1717
01:43:17.170 --> 01:43:20.440
And somebody from the people who make,
my record's called me up like,

1718
01:43:20.441 --> 01:43:22.870
what's going on with your first rep because of the new one just came out like,

1719
01:43:22.871 --> 01:43:27.040
why is your first record selling a bunch?
And I have no,
I looked and they go,

1720
01:43:27.250 --> 01:43:30.880
you blew it.
You blew up on black Twitter.
Wow.
And I didn't know what that was.

1721
01:43:30.881 --> 01:43:33.370
It apparently it's kind of like just the three.
The rest of the world is like,

1722
01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:36.340
shit gets hot in the like a black Instagram,

1723
01:43:36.530 --> 01:43:41.230
black Twitter first and it of black Instagram too.
Well,
I mean if it's,
you know,

1724
01:43:41.231 --> 01:43:44.830
it's not separate,
but it's within the,
this one dude,

1725
01:43:44.831 --> 01:43:47.980
his name was de Quan or something.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's a big mean guy.

1726
01:43:48.010 --> 01:43:52.940
He posted my post to fuck you bitch.
And it got like 200 million views.
Wow.
Crazy.

1727
01:43:53.150 --> 01:43:53.990
And it was in the mind,

1728
01:43:54.110 --> 01:43:57.200
that song from the first record went back up the charts after while my new one

1729
01:43:57.201 --> 01:44:00.470
was coming out.
So I want to,
I know you can the watchers and all those guys.

1730
01:44:00.910 --> 01:44:03.860
I know you guys got a lot of black fans.
Yeah.
Go,
go for it man.

1731
01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:12.710
<v 16>We're going to get a real taste right now.
Awesome.
Yeah.</v>

1732
01:44:12.711 --> 01:44:15.910
What's up?
Yeah.

1733
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:21.290
What's this?
What are we seeing?

1734
01:44:25.610 --> 01:44:29.290
<v 11>Oh Wow.
That's gorgeous.
Someone made that for you?
Gibson.</v>

1735
01:44:29.291 --> 01:44:32.470
Getting them gives me free guitar.
No.
Ah Wow.

1736
01:44:33.070 --> 01:44:35.020
And at what point does that happen though?

1737
01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:37.420
I think when my first album was in the top 10.

1738
01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:41.380
So a Gibson rep called suffering injuries,
we should,
so some,
someone a Gibson.

1739
01:44:41.620 --> 01:44:44.580
Wow.
I want to take a picture of you with your Gibson and his,

1740
01:44:44.590 --> 01:44:48.760
he has his name Tom Together.
Um,

1741
01:44:49.450 --> 01:44:53.260
let me ask you also before you play it,
what,
um,

1742
01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:57.820
so you know,
you're in Kentucky or in Nashville growing up,
uh,

1743
01:44:58.270 --> 01:44:59.800
are you always playing music then?
Growing up,

1744
01:44:59.830 --> 01:45:01.750
I was always playing music and then,
um,

1745
01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:08.290
so I was always playing and I always,
and I was more of a rock guy to be honest.

1746
01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:09.180
Yeah.
Um,

1747
01:45:09.430 --> 01:45:11.950
and I've got my headphones also let me know if I'm not close enough to the mind,

1748
01:45:13.810 --> 01:45:17.430
but for some reason when I played and sang,
I could always sing better.
No,

1749
01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:19.540
sounded more natural.
When I played country,
I couldn't,

1750
01:45:19.541 --> 01:45:23.470
I didn't have a good rock voice and I didn't really,
I wasn't like a killer,

1751
01:45:23.530 --> 01:45:27.880
like guitar.
I had nothing to offer really for,
you know,
like I love Zeppelin,

1752
01:45:27.881 --> 01:45:30.820
but there's nothing like I can't be Robert Plant,
I can't beat Jimmy page,

1753
01:45:30.821 --> 01:45:35.260
but I could kind of hold mine.
I could hold my own with in the country stuff.

1754
01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:40.060
But yeah,
they called me,
they said if you only play Gibson guitars,

1755
01:45:40.330 --> 01:45:43.030
we'll give you all the gifts as you want.
One.
I go,

1756
01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:46.150
that sounds like a fucking cause.
Gibson,
it gives it a,

1757
01:45:46.151 --> 01:45:49.480
Martin are the two best acoustics.
It's like Mercedes,
BMW,

1758
01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:52.690
it doesn't matter where you already,
so you already had some Gibsons though.

1759
01:45:52.691 --> 01:45:55.150
You were playing Gibson.
I was actually playing a Martin at the time and I go,

1760
01:45:55.151 --> 01:45:58.540
I told him I had a Martin there was just like keeping your house and don't play

1761
01:45:58.541 --> 01:46:03.180
it in public and we're fine.
I said,
it didn't make me bash it or throw it away.

1762
01:46:03.181 --> 01:46:05.670
Yeah.
You know?
Yeah.
It was really,

1763
01:46:05.671 --> 01:46:08.790
it was really cool of him and I'm so you're going to play time.

1764
01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:11.190
I get this thing out.
I'm still amazed that they made this amazing.

1765
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:13.590
It's beautiful.
They're going to play.
Fuck you bitch.
Yeah.

1766
01:46:13.591 --> 01:46:17.000
Just cause it's really easy to play on on acoustic.
Okay,
sure.
I'm in tune.
Yeah.

1767
01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:22.693
How's the sound?

1768
01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:25.430
<v 15>That's a Gibson sound</v>

1769
01:46:56.900 --> 01:47:00.780
fucking lineage.
You broke my heart.

1770
01:47:01.970 --> 01:47:05.940
Fuck your friends tearing us apart.

1771

Love your dog will be never comes home.

1772
01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:16.080
You leave it
alone.

1773
01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:25.813
Now you're

1774
01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:32.990
jerking off pictures.

1775
01:47:33.010 --> 01:47:35.780
All this full.

1776
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:41.250
A swap on your fleece.

Hello.

Hi.

<v 3>That's fantastic.
Great man.
That was beautiful.</v>

1790
01:49:03.090 --> 01:49:05.970
Thank you for doing that.
Okay.
I loved it.

1791
01:49:06.310 --> 01:49:08.580
But you know what I love it does Harken back to,

1792
01:49:08.581 --> 01:49:10.830
I mean at least what little I know of country music,

1793
01:49:10.831 --> 01:49:15.510
kind of the Oji themes of like hope your fucking dog dies.

1794
01:49:15.570 --> 01:49:17.920
You know,
it's the heartbreak and drama.

1795
01:49:18.010 --> 01:49:20.710
<v 11>Appreciate they,
cause that was kind of my whole point,
which is,
you know,</v>

1796
01:49:20.711 --> 01:49:25.310
you could dumped by a girl,
um,
and you know,

1797
01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:29.280
if,
whether it's your fault or not,
let's just assume it was my fault.
He,

1798
01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:32.960
when she dumped me like I was being an Asshole,
you're under your first dog.

1799
01:49:32.961 --> 01:49:34.940
It's like,
Oh fuck you bitch.
You know,
it's like in your head,

1800
01:49:34.941 --> 01:49:38.200
it's not like women are bitches,
you know,
it's just like,
yeah,

1801
01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:41.450
fuck you for hurting me.
It's almost empowering in a weird way.

1802
01:49:41.451 --> 01:49:44.450
Like you had that much control over me,
you know,
like fuck you bitch.

1803
01:49:45.630 --> 01:49:46.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1804
01:49:46.100 --> 01:49:48.010
<v 11>Cause I grew up,
you know,
with country.
But I also grew</v>

1805
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:50.740
<v 1>up,
lets you know that hip hop world,
of course it's out there.
It's like,</v>

1806
01:49:51.070 --> 01:49:56.070
why can't we talk openly in an uncensored about if I,

1807
01:49:57.551 --> 01:50:01.990
if I'm feeling that a million other people gotta be feeling.
So just why,

1808
01:50:02.170 --> 01:50:04.500
why sensor it when,
when I got to ask this,
we haven't yet,

1809
01:50:04.530 --> 01:50:07.540
cause you mentioned your family multiple times and we're looking at these

1810
01:50:07.541 --> 01:50:10.880
posters and he tracks and everything.
What do they think of this music?

1811
01:50:10.881 --> 01:50:14.090
Like what does your mom think of wheels turning?

1812
01:50:14.220 --> 01:50:18.880
Because it had all this fun on podcasts.
I started doing a podcast and it's,

1813
01:50:19.180 --> 01:50:22.300
we're still working out the kinks but it's,
it's up on iTunes and shit.

1814
01:50:22.301 --> 01:50:27.100
But I didn't have interviewed my dad on it and um,
they don't love it.

1815
01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:30.760
I did play a,
they came to a couple of gay,

1816
01:50:30.761 --> 01:50:33.490
they came to a couple of Nashville gigs and I'm,
dude,

1817
01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:37.090
I'll tell you what's fucking weird.
It's a whole big audience

1818
01:50:38.530 --> 01:50:42.790
<v 11>singing along to fuck you bitch while your mom.
Cause I got my shades on,</v>

1819
01:50:42.791 --> 01:50:44.980
you know,
and I could see my,
I'm watch all,
I'm watching his,
my,

1820
01:50:45.010 --> 01:50:46.390
I'm pulling it down like she can't,

1821
01:50:46.391 --> 01:50:50.250
so she can't tell and I'm just watching my momma,
you know.
And she's,

1822
01:50:50.470 --> 01:50:54.130
she's got a weird,
I've never seen her,
she's never made this face before since,

1823
01:50:54.131 --> 01:50:58.240
but the face was,
it was a weird mix of like,
I'm proud that,
you know,

1824
01:50:58.241 --> 01:51:03.100
there's a whole giant room of people singing along mixed with what did I do

1825
01:51:03.101 --> 01:51:05.810
wrong to make him sing like this?
And she's,

1826
01:51:05.820 --> 01:51:08.150
she's watching them go to the merchant booth by and tee shirts and shit.
So it's,

1827
01:51:08.151 --> 01:51:10.270
yeah,
I've never seen so much.

1828
01:51:12.070 --> 01:51:14.050
I'm proud and discuss it at the same time.

1829
01:51:14.051 --> 01:51:16.510
Like she got both expressions on her face really well.

1830
01:51:16.690 --> 01:51:21.690
Go to a thousand ranch dotcom and buy some tickets to see those big mushy

1831
01:51:21.701 --> 01:51:26.450
purples as my dad login Christina's website.
But don't you think though,

1832
01:51:26.470 --> 01:51:30.340
you know,
once your mom sees how successful you are that you can be like,
mom,

1833
01:51:30.341 --> 01:51:33.280
this is the house that fuck you bitch belt.
You know what I'm saying?
Well,

1834
01:51:33.670 --> 01:51:35.380
he ain't build a house yet and that,
um,

1835
01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:40.360
and once I buy them a house may be better.
But yeah,
I will say,
um,
yeah,

1836
01:51:40.361 --> 01:51:44.350
I mean if,
if,
if,
if my songs were like,
like she gets it,
you know,

1837
01:51:44.351 --> 01:51:46.790
it'd be different if I had a hit song with like,
you know,

1838
01:51:46.791 --> 01:51:49.950
like women are cunts or just something like that.
You know,

1839
01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:54.200
just like my mom's got a Harry Bush or something and you know,

1840
01:51:54.490 --> 01:51:56.110
she understands what I'm,
where I'm coming from,

1841
01:51:56.111 --> 01:51:59.110
whether it actually digs it cause she has her first,
his reaction was like,

1842
01:51:59.111 --> 01:52:03.220
you've got such a pretty voice and why don't you just keep it clean.

1843
01:52:03.220 --> 01:52:07.390
I'm always like,
hmm,
what's,
what's my,
my thing is again,

1844
01:52:07.570 --> 01:52:08.620
back to thanking you guys,

1845
01:52:08.621 --> 01:52:13.240
it's just like now that you got youtube and streaming services and like why do

1846
01:52:13.241 --> 01:52:15.340
it,
why the fuck?
Why do I need to give you?

1847
01:52:15.341 --> 01:52:17.680
But the thing is like there's levels like for,

1848
01:52:17.681 --> 01:52:19.450
I'm thinking for like as a parent too,

1849
01:52:19.780 --> 01:52:24.220
there's levels of language where it's like,
oh my son curses,
you know,

1850
01:52:24.310 --> 01:52:28.450
and then there's like I'm the pussy king and like finger up my butt.

1851
01:52:28.690 --> 01:52:31.270
I figured out my bubbe was definitely the weirdest one where they're just like,

1852
01:52:32.890 --> 01:52:34.870
I don't know if you do.
Do you want to hear the origin of that song?

1853
01:52:34.990 --> 01:52:38.940
Because I was hanging out with a buddy of mine in,
I'm in Nashville,

1854
01:52:38.970 --> 01:52:42.520
he writes kind of hit songs for country artists and uh,

1855
01:52:43.450 --> 01:52:48.200
he was saying this one big star I can't name was just like,
he was talking about,

1856
01:52:48.201 --> 01:52:50.810
you know,
these young girls on the road,
kind of what I'm singing about.

1857
01:52:50.810 --> 01:52:53.420
And he's like,
you know what,
these young girls,

1858
01:52:53.421 --> 01:52:54.740
they don't know what they're doing.
He's like,

1859
01:52:54.741 --> 01:52:58.730
sometimes you just want a finger up your ass and everyone in the room's laughing

1860
01:52:58.790 --> 01:53:00.830
and I'm the only one who's looking.
I'm like,
that's a song.
You know,

1861
01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:05.030
a guy who's just like,
he can get any girl he wants but I'm going to do it right.

1862
01:53:05.090 --> 01:53:07.920
But he really,
but what he wants,
it's a finger up his fucking,
you know,

1863
01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:09.920
like you can never get what you want.
Like this dude just,

1864
01:53:09.921 --> 01:53:12.980
we can only get off of the finger up his ass.
And I was like,
again,

1865
01:53:12.981 --> 01:53:15.620
I guess I'm the only guy in country music who would say that's a song right

1866
01:53:15.621 --> 01:53:17.980
there.
But I think they're definitely,
although they won't do,

1867
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:21.440
they don't want to bring it up.
Like,
do you,
cause it's,
even though I sing me,

1868
01:53:21.441 --> 01:53:24.170
it's a first person song,
it's about somebody else.

1869
01:53:24.170 --> 01:53:26.090
But I think my parents were kind of looking at me like,

1870
01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:30.670
do you get off on a finger up your course?
Their thing?
Yeah.
They're worried.

1871
01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:34.730
Like when did we,
when did wheeler and start doing that.
Yeah.

1872
01:53:34.731 --> 01:53:37.460
Because if you want to know the truth,
which is,
I even,

1873
01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:41.830
I've heard people say that they actually enjoy like at the doctor,

1874
01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:45.470
like I fucking hate.
Like I owe the,
I'm the opposite.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No,

1875
01:53:45.900 --> 01:53:49.280
I don't think that's pleasurable.
I know people who've say they fucking dug it,

1876
01:53:49.950 --> 01:53:53.420
the checkup.
I mean,
I could see if they can say they're digging it during sex,

1877
01:53:53.421 --> 01:53:56.270
but like the check of it.
Yeah.
I don't want nothing near my ass.
So the,
I mean,

1878
01:53:56.330 --> 01:53:58.520
I don't either.
I pride myself on my honesty,

1879
01:53:58.521 --> 01:54:01.970
but I guess I'm just proven that that one's not elements about somebody else.

1880
01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:03.290
But yeah,
that's definitely,

1881
01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:08.310
<v 3>but that's another universal theme.
I mean,
I think a lot of men would,</v>

1882
01:54:08.330 --> 01:54:10.820
would it resonates with,
I want a finger in my butt.

1883
01:54:11.530 --> 01:54:14.770
<v 11>Yeah.
I think the bigger idea was,
again,
not this specific part of it,</v>

1884
01:54:14.771 --> 01:54:16.900
but just the idea of just like the weird shit people are into.

1885
01:54:16.930 --> 01:54:18.310
I wonder how many people like,

1886
01:54:18.340 --> 01:54:23.200
and these towns you go to end up there because someone else is like,
hey,

1887
01:54:23.201 --> 01:54:25.740
you know,
this guy likes going to be in town and like,

1888
01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:29.020
I got tickets and he's like,
he's is a singer.
Yeah,
he's great,
he's great.

1889
01:54:29.021 --> 01:54:31.930
And someone just like,
all right,
I'll go.
And they're just,
you know,

1890
01:54:31.931 --> 01:54:33.640
they're in the country and they're just like,

1891
01:54:34.180 --> 01:54:37.390
let's see what this dude is all about.
The best part is all the,
you know,

1892
01:54:37.391 --> 01:54:38.860
the do's with a backward baseball,

1893
01:54:38.861 --> 01:54:40.970
hats singing because we end the show with which one you queer.

1894
01:54:40.971 --> 01:54:44.050
It's going to suck my dick and watching a whole crowd just like,
dude,

1895
01:54:44.051 --> 01:54:45.880
just like scream that at me.
Yeah.

1896
01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:48.410
Just like what are they going to do with the energy?

1897
01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:51.320
Are they going to go home and blow each other?
I don't even know.
Yeah.

1898
01:54:51.370 --> 01:54:52.720
I think that's what's going to happen.
Yeah.

1899
01:54:53.260 --> 01:54:55.270
I have noticed as the crowds expanding more,

1900
01:54:55.271 --> 01:54:58.890
we're definitely seeing more women and more diverse crowd.
Cause yeah,

1901
01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:02.620
those first,
especially the first dates on that first tour,
it was just me.

1902
01:55:02.621 --> 01:55:04.900
It was a saw the sausage.
It's just dudes,

1903
01:55:04.901 --> 01:55:08.040
which you can't really put out shit like this and complain when it's all done.

1904
01:55:08.110 --> 01:55:13.090
<v 3>Well,
I mean,
honestly as,
as a lady,
I,
I would be like,
this guy's really funny.</v>

1905
01:55:13.210 --> 01:55:16.630
I feel like I get it.
Uh,
I don't know if I would go to a show cause I'm like,

1906
01:55:16.780 --> 01:55:20.860
is it,
is it going to be a bunch of dudes?
Are they going to tear me apart?
Yeah.

1907
01:55:21.130 --> 01:55:23.890
No,
it's not.
It's not like that.
But you're saying there's women there.

1908
01:55:23.891 --> 01:55:24.980
So that was great.
It

1909
01:55:24.980 --> 01:55:27.290
<v 11>is,
I think is now.
I think it's like a liberating,</v>

1910
01:55:27.470 --> 01:55:30.770
it's like I work all fucking week and then Friday night I'm going to get drunk

1911
01:55:30.771 --> 01:55:33.110
and listened to these fucking,
and I'm going to good music.

1912
01:55:33.111 --> 01:55:36.380
I'm going to dance and sing about pussy.
Yeah,
right,
and there's salt it.
Listen,

1913
01:55:36.381 --> 01:55:38.270
I mentioned plenty of Dick's and yeah,
right.

1914
01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:42.080
There's Dick's and pussies is what you're saying.
Yeah.
It's a good time for a,

1915
01:55:42.090 --> 01:55:43.040
actually,
I forgot to,

1916
01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:47.170
my manager was going to text and say which shows we're hurting the most.

1917
01:55:47.220 --> 01:55:50.490
I could mention them here,
but he never texted back,
so fire his ass.

1918
01:55:50.650 --> 01:55:52.050
That's what I'm trying to think what it is.

1919
01:55:52.051 --> 01:55:55.620
Just the audiences are so weird too because we do find in the south,

1920
01:55:55.621 --> 01:55:59.730
but our best audiences for whatever reason,
the fucking west coast really,

1921
01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:03.750
we sell out all up and down the west coast.
SARS or west coast.

1922
01:56:04.020 --> 01:56:05.160
West Coast is great.
Yeah.

1923
01:56:05.161 --> 01:56:07.620
I think it's maybe it's just that you don't get much country.

1924
01:56:07.621 --> 01:56:11.430
I guess he popped possibly or maybe just your themes resonate.

1925
01:56:11.431 --> 01:56:14.150
You know you had maybe they like it up the ass here a little bit more.

1926
01:56:14.210 --> 01:56:18.030
A little bit.
A little more honest about it.
What was it like,
um,

1927
01:56:19.710 --> 01:56:24.450
by the way,
how much effort do you think?
Like what type of thinking,

1928
01:56:24.810 --> 01:56:29.810
planning and time goes into Johnny Depp getting ready to go out.

1929
01:56:31.290 --> 01:56:36.240
I know,
like,
look,
I know,
you know he's from my hometown.
Why?
Really?

1930
01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:39.510
And I knew his cousin and his,
his cousins left.

1931
01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:42.720
I don't want to say the guy's name,
but I thought death was a stage name.

1932
01:56:42.721 --> 01:56:45.660
It's not,
I know his cousin,
his last name is Deb.
Oh really?
Yeah.
I mean,

1933
01:56:45.661 --> 01:56:48.820
isn't this like,
I mean,
just the coordination.

1934
01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:52.160
<v 4>Well he's,
but he's dressing like the pirate that he plays.
Yeah,</v>

1935
01:56:52.260 --> 01:56:53.370
he's big on running jokes.

1936
01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:55.980
<v 11>Fucking scarves.
And they know.</v>

1937
01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:58.530
What did he say the other day that he was going to like shoot the president?

1938
01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:01.950
Yeah,
he made like some and then he had,
he did,
he issued an apology the next day.

1939
01:57:01.951 --> 01:57:04.860
You got to watch that shit cause they can,
yeah.
You can't say that shit man.

1940
01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:07.030
You don't want to be sure if you're like that famous.

1941
01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:09.870
You're like that guy who's probably,
he's probably doing drugs all the time.

1942
01:57:09.871 --> 01:57:13.650
You can't have this secret service fucking watching you all the time.
No.
Yeah,

1943
01:57:13.651 --> 01:57:16.320
he was like,
what was the last time an actor shot the president?

1944
01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:18.180
Which do that again?
Yeah.
That kind of thing.

1945
01:57:18.430 --> 01:57:21.470
<v 4>That's actually really hard to do,
to accessorize like that.</v>

1946
01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:26.820
<v 11>That's theoretically a like a,
just a shot that somebody grabbed,</v>

1947
01:57:26.821 --> 01:57:27.930
but that looks fucking pose

1948
01:57:27.950 --> 01:57:31.280
<v 4>does hell right.
And that's,
that's just him that at that thing.
But I mean,</v>

1949
01:57:31.281 --> 01:57:34.170
that was bullshit.
You gotta take all this off to shower.
That's what I'm saying.

1950
01:57:34.171 --> 01:57:34.990
That's all I shower.
Yeah.

1951
01:57:34.990 --> 01:57:37.860
<v 11>Matt,
you're meeting a girl fucking like you.
If you meet a girl and just fucker,</v>

1952
01:57:37.861 --> 01:57:38.561
I've after this,

1953
01:57:38.561 --> 01:57:42.600
like she's gonna get her with her ass fucking bruise with all that metal banging

1954
01:57:42.620 --> 01:57:47.560
against her.
It's just like,
it's a lot.
The thing that I,
that I would not,

1955
01:57:47.620 --> 01:57:50.800
I don't buy about this at all,
is that he's just like,
I just put this on,

1956
01:57:51.010 --> 01:57:54.730
you know,
like I just,
I got up and I got dressed.
No you didn't.
Yeah.

1957
01:57:54.731 --> 01:57:57.310
I grabbed my keep and take it to a chain and put it around my neck.

1958
01:57:57.340 --> 01:58:01.360
I got my eight scarf,
sal and I got out my 15 wristbands or necklaces.

1959
01:58:01.390 --> 01:58:05.950
I think he's trying to be Keith Richards.
I heard that.
He really loves him.
Yeah.

1960
01:58:05.951 --> 01:58:08.050
Yeah.
Well that,
that character,

1961
01:58:08.350 --> 01:58:12.370
the pirates character's supposed to be based on Keith Richards.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1962
01:58:12.371 --> 01:58:14.320
I mean that's,
that's probably what it is too.

1963
01:58:14.321 --> 01:58:16.090
And I think Keith Richards is honestly,

1964
01:58:16.450 --> 01:58:20.500
I think Keith Richards is like actually does probably fucking sleep in that shit

1965
01:58:20.530 --> 01:58:23.410
and a bunch of shit and then just grab shit to go.
Like right.
That's pissy.

1966
01:58:23.411 --> 01:58:25.000
He's probably legit.
Yeah,
you're probably right.

1967
01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:28.340
<v 4>So much energy.
And I always admire that kind of,</v>

1968
01:58:28.341 --> 01:58:32.060
that level of accessorizing on women.
Like I talk a lot of thought,

1969
01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:35.300
but it's not useful.
Like I swim a lot.

1970
01:58:35.450 --> 01:58:39.670
I have to take off every fucking Chatchki and the,
and the earrings and

1971
01:58:40.050 --> 01:58:43.480
<v 11>isn't it too much true that he's like,
you know,
he's like the star,</v>

1972
01:58:43.481 --> 01:58:47.760
but he's like a big,
he's a kid star basically.
You know this guy.
Yeah.
I mean,

1973
01:58:47.770 --> 01:58:50.950
he's like,
you know,
crazy fucking dude who looks like that.

1974
01:58:50.951 --> 01:58:54.350
Who's was like his big hits are all kids movies now.
Right?

1975
01:58:54.351 --> 01:58:59.320
It's like Willy Wonka and stuff.
True.
Do you want to,

1976
01:58:59.350 --> 01:59:04.140
do you want to do one more before we were bounce?
Do you want me to,
yeah,

1977
01:59:04.141 --> 01:59:07.940
it's fantastic.
Love it.
I'll do one off off the new record.
Yeah.
Um,
what's it,

1978
01:59:07.941 --> 01:59:09.840
what's it called?
There's what's called Summers in Kentucky.

1979
01:59:09.841 --> 01:59:14.640
Sometimes people get a,
uh,
a couple of radio stations.

1980
01:59:14.641 --> 01:59:16.410
Occasionally you'll see them in the charge and the,

1981
01:59:16.830 --> 01:59:19.330
some of the titles of the songs are clean.
Yeah.

1982
01:59:19.910 --> 01:59:21.170
You can get themselves in a little less.

1983
01:59:21.210 --> 01:59:24.810
You see trouble by playing summaries in Kentucky.
We can play that.
Oh,
he's in,

1984
01:59:24.811 --> 01:59:29.100
he's on the billboard charts and summertime stuff is nice.
That's really funny.

1985
01:59:29.610 --> 01:59:31.980
There's a video for this too though.
I was really happy with.
And by the way,

1986
01:59:31.981 --> 01:59:34.250
the one you sang before,
uh,
what was the first one?

1987
01:59:34.260 --> 01:59:36.540
Fuck you bitch that has a video.
That's a video.

1988
01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:41.830
That one shot up.
That one had it.
Like I said,

1989
01:59:42.190 --> 01:59:45.370
black Twitter must be huge cause we had a huge couple of weeks.

1990
01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:49.620
That's awesome man.
So this is summers in Kentucky off the new album.

1991
01:59:49.710 --> 01:59:54.710
All Wheeler Wheeler buy it on iTunes or Amazon or my website because we're

1992
01:59:55.341 --> 01:59:59.030
having trouble like those charts and not to kiss my own ass,
but I will.

1993
01:59:59.540 --> 02:00:00.770
Those charts are,

1994
02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:05.240
it means something to me because it's not a level playing field,
it's my fault.

1995
02:00:05.241 --> 02:00:08.000
But you know,
all the other guys are selling out if fucking Starbucks,

1996
02:00:08.001 --> 02:00:11.510
Walmart best buy and there's giant racks of fucking,

1997
02:00:11.511 --> 02:00:13.820
you know Chris Stapleton who I love Simpleton,
but you know,

1998
02:00:13.821 --> 02:00:17.400
he's got giant racks of his shit at Walmart that people throw in their cart and

1999
02:00:17.470 --> 02:00:21.650
selling 50,000 a week.
It's just Walmart dam and I fucked up.

2000
02:00:21.890 --> 02:00:26.390
I fucked it up.
I'm singing this garbage.
This is summers in Kentucky.

2001
02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:37.200
<v 15>[inaudible] else.</v>

2002
02:00:39.871 --> 02:00:44.871
I was just 16 [inaudible] dark down by the [inaudible] change

2003
02:01:06.070 --> 02:01:09.190
meeting girls on the road who are half my age.

2004
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:16.280
Sometimes I think about the [inaudible].

2005
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:21.550
I miss that precipice.

2006
02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:27.820
Now you've had a couple of kids in itself stretch.

2007
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:32.830
Dale [inaudible] starting to thing when we can figure it out.

2008
02:01:33.820 --> 02:01:38.820
[inaudible]

2009
02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:24.873
perfect.

2010
02:02:41.950 --> 02:02:43.330
Bring your flabby ass black

2011
02:02:48.620 --> 02:02:50.100
looking pretty rough.

2012
02:02:59.340 --> 02:03:04.170
<v 11>My favorite part is that you mentioned before you saying it you in trouble.</v>

2013
02:03:04.171 --> 02:03:06.930
I can just see approach drink program director.

2014
02:03:06.931 --> 02:03:11.010
That's about as Grambling from his office that that's,

2015
02:03:11.020 --> 02:03:14.910
that's about as far as I go with a serious song before it turned because that's

2016
02:03:14.911 --> 02:03:18.720
a song I was back in Kentucky and around Thanksgiving and I'm,

2017
02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:21.780
a bunch of my friends were like,
let's go to our high school reunion.
I'm like,

2018
02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:23.730
I didn't want to go,
but I'm with them.
Like let's just go.

2019
02:03:24.210 --> 02:03:25.860
And it was that same old thing like you know,

2020
02:03:26.370 --> 02:03:29.490
there's the hot girl from high school and like man,
she looks disgusting.

2021
02:03:29.491 --> 02:03:32.470
And they were like,
of course we're all just like,
look at us,
we're,

2022
02:03:32.471 --> 02:03:33.360
we're fucking worse.

2023
02:03:33.390 --> 02:03:37.220
And also like we'd still fucker and sure she'd had 12 kids and he always wore

2024
02:03:37.230 --> 02:03:40.750
marriages or whatever it was.
And we're just like,
you know,
I,

2025
02:03:41.490 --> 02:03:44.220
I don't think I could have written that song without that kind of stretched up

2026
02:03:44.221 --> 02:03:47.100
pussy language.
You know,
it's,
it's a different song,
you know like,

2027
02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:51.300
but that definitely the visual of people just being like,

2028
02:03:51.510 --> 02:03:54.630
oh it's on the charts price and have this firing.

2029
02:03:55.500 --> 02:03:57.840
Well we did for fun was we sit,
what you do is,

2030
02:03:57.841 --> 02:04:01.590
I don't know how much you know about radio,
but you,
you do this where you set,

2031
02:04:01.591 --> 02:04:05.730
you have a big announcement where see that the song's going to radio and you in

2032
02:04:05.731 --> 02:04:08.220
the next week in the trade you put out,
you know,
like 50 ads.

2033
02:04:08.221 --> 02:04:09.990
Like how many stations added across the country.

2034
02:04:10.290 --> 02:04:14.490
So we actually sent that song to radio to country radio and then took out a big

2035
02:04:14.491 --> 02:04:16.590
ad the next week.
He said,
you know,

2036
02:04:16.630 --> 02:04:21.630
picked up my pictures and said thanks to country radio zero ads because we got

2037
02:04:22.051 --> 02:04:26.100
to add it to zero station controversial because at that week what they do is

2038
02:04:26.101 --> 02:04:30.030
they sh on this these fucking stupid like zero stations.
Yeah.

2039
02:04:30.031 --> 02:04:33.580
Billboard puts the chart,
you know,
you know so and so.
It got,

2040
02:04:33.950 --> 02:04:36.180
Garth got the g man got 50 ads,

2041
02:04:36.181 --> 02:04:39.510
whatever and actually they usually don't print it because everyone got zero.

2042
02:04:39.511 --> 02:04:41.100
They usually don't print zero,
but they printed me,

2043
02:04:41.580 --> 02:04:46.170
we Walker Junior Summers and Kentucky's zero ads.
Wow,
that's too bad.

2044
02:04:46.171 --> 02:04:48.840
That's their loss because I really think your song does,
like you say,

2045
02:04:48.841 --> 02:04:52.020
reflect reality.
That is your tits get soggy and cats.

2046
02:04:52.021 --> 02:04:55.200
It's almost like it's 2017 why can't you say dirty words?

2047
02:04:55.201 --> 02:04:58.160
I mean I understand that it's the law,
but I mean it's silly.

2048
02:04:58.200 --> 02:04:59.760
Why can't you fucking curse?

2049
02:04:59.761 --> 02:05:03.540
I mean I see as an SNL like kind of strutting around it.

2050
02:05:03.541 --> 02:05:07.180
You know I saw Chappelle doing some crazy shit on there.
Yeah.

2051
02:05:07.230 --> 02:05:09.960
Why can't you just say pussy?
It's not,
who cares?

2052
02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:15.120
Here's why I don't understand is what I said before is like I heard pussy on

2053
02:05:15.121 --> 02:05:18.930
meet the press.
I heard Trump saying,
you know,
play that clip.
It's like,

2054
02:05:18.931 --> 02:05:23.520
so if I said it in like a mean way,
it would work.
I gas if,
yeah,
if it's a,

2055
02:05:23.521 --> 02:05:25.260
if it's a pejorative way,

2056
02:05:26.010 --> 02:05:27.980
<v 0>women,
I've seen it like in a meme or something,</v>

2057
02:05:27.981 --> 02:05:31.460
but it's still kind of crazy that now when they,
when they talk about that,

2058
02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:35.450
that pussy audio and that clip,
the one guy,
the one guy,

2059
02:05:35.480 --> 02:05:38.100
one of the guys in this conversation got fired,
right.

2060
02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:40.330
And the other guy is president of the United States,

2061
02:05:40.340 --> 02:05:42.260
the guy that actually said it is president,

2062
02:05:42.410 --> 02:05:45.350
but we're still going to act like it's something that we,

2063
02:05:45.590 --> 02:05:47.360
nobody can say you're here,
you know?

2064
02:05:47.540 --> 02:05:49.640
<v 11>Yeah,
exactly.
It's like mmm,</v>

2065
02:05:52.510 --> 02:05:53.343
<v 0>you could.
I mean</v>

2066
02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:57.280
<v 11>I assumed,
I just assumed like everyone else it was you.</v>

2067
02:05:57.580 --> 02:06:00.440
You can't say grab him by the,
and now they just that he's always like you.

2068
02:06:00.450 --> 02:06:04.930
I'm the smartest fucking guy.
I'm like,
I'm so smart.
It's like,
ew,
ew.
Ew.

2069
02:06:05.120 --> 02:06:08.430
You grab,
you bragged about grabbing people by the pussy with a microphone on,

2070
02:06:09.980 --> 02:06:12.400
like,
come on man.
Like get the games.

2071
02:06:13.980 --> 02:06:17.260
That was a great song.
That was awesome.
It was really funny.
Yeah.
We'll uh,

2072
02:06:17.340 --> 02:06:18.990
listen to listeners,

2073
02:06:18.991 --> 02:06:22.080
listen to the album version because this producer did an amazing job on that
one.

2074
02:06:22.081 --> 02:06:22.620
I don't like,

2075
02:06:22.620 --> 02:06:27.120
<v 0>well check it out.
Look,
get the album is called Ole Wheeler,
Wheeler Walker Jr.</v>

2076
02:06:27.500 --> 02:06:31.890
Um,
and uh,
go see him live in concert.
Go to Wheeler Walker Jr com.

2077
02:06:32.340 --> 02:06:37.230
And also while you're at it,
pick up the old one.
The first one,

2078
02:06:37.620 --> 02:06:38.940
a redneck shit.

2079
02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:43.200
<v 11>What's his real,
that's enough because like I said,
it's,
it's,</v>

2080
02:06:43.270 --> 02:06:46.200
it's been this podcast world that's really keeping me alive.
Well,

2081
02:06:46.510 --> 02:06:49.060
there's no one else that'll have me,
they're going to support you for sure man.

2082
02:06:49.150 --> 02:06:50.860
And it's,
but it's this whole new,
it's really,

2083
02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:52.990
it's almost like underground radio in a way.
It's this whole,

2084
02:06:53.550 --> 02:06:56.500
this whole new thing,
which people are underestimating,
you know,

2085
02:06:56.501 --> 02:06:59.180
like they've been underestimating it,
but they're,

2086
02:06:59.181 --> 02:07:02.170
they're starting to come around.
Like I said,
I had a top.

2087
02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:05.290
You're not going to get any other top 10 country artists stopping by here.

2088
02:07:05.291 --> 02:07:09.460
I don't think that it's like our first,
but it's like they should.
They should.

2089
02:07:09.670 --> 02:07:12.970
Why wouldn't they?
You know,
they're smart.
You're,
you're a trailblazer.

2090
02:07:13.150 --> 02:07:17.320
You're unique,
you're outcast.
And I think that's why people appreciate your work.

2091
02:07:17.650 --> 02:07:22.060
Thank you.
I'll help.
It keeps going because
I gotta make this money back.
