<v 1>Christina</v>

5
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.980
<v 0>sounds funny.
It actually that part down.
So funny.
Now</v>

6
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.110
his scream and stuff.
Do you want to know what the name of that song is?

7
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.730
It's called.
How do you not find that funny by Alan Bell?

8
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.380
That's great.
Yeah.
It's funny cause I don't see him right now.

9
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.680
I don't see that he's suffering so I can just laugh at the sounds that he's

10
00:01:39.681 --> 00:01:42.850
making,
right?
Yeah,
it's good stuff,
right?
It's a really good

11
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.890
talent.
Openness.

12
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.490
All M Jeezy what's going on Thomas?

13
00:01:49.491 --> 00:01:54.110
Oris we are still,
um,
so people know we're both sick.
It's nice.

14
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.250
I know.
I've been sick for like two months.
I feel like I,

15
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.950
it's hard to shake it.
So annoying.

16
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.910
Cause our kids always sick and then you get whatever preschool disease he brings

17
00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:08.030
home when he gets sick every other week.
I know.

18
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:11.810
And now there's foot and mouth going around his preschool today when I dropped

19
00:02:11.811 --> 00:02:15.650
him off and I almost hesitated and then I'm like,
you know what?

20
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.700
He's going to need to get that.
Eventually.
Every kid gets some,

21
00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:23.960
but I did.
They have that shit when we were kids.
Hand,
foot and mouth disease.

22
00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:28.070
I feel like it doesn't sound familiar from that era and then we're hearing it

23
00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:30.650
later.
Yeah.
I feel like this is a recent thing.

24
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.530
You and I aren't really sure what it is.
We had chicken pox.

25
00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:37.160
That was our generation.
We do have chicken pox.

26
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.250
You got chicken pox and you can find scabs on your head.
Yeah.

27
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:43.930
It was the best ones because you could pick those.
Really,
really scrape at him.

28
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:44.570
Yeah.

29
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.680
Who cares if you get a scar on your head and you'll find some blood in there.

30
00:02:47.681 --> 00:02:52.190
You're like,
oh,
this is all those oatmeal baths.
They smell delicious.

31
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.590
They sure do.
Thanks everybody.

32
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.060
A lot of people enjoy Johnny Pemberton's episode.
How funny is he?

33
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.820
He's great and his accents were amazing.
Master.
I don't know about that.

34
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:06.430
Let's not get crazy.
He's really good.
Hey Tom,

35
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.960
if there's only one master and that's you.
Thanks a lot.
Dogs by

36
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.410
wow.
What?
What region was that was east London.
Wow.

37
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.480
You are so down to the,

38
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.840
just to the actual neighborhoods.

39
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.450
What else have you been working on accent wise?
Um,

40
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.900
I know you're watching that Winston Churchill movie.

41
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.550
Did you pick up any inspiration from there?
Uh,
I mean,
you know,

42
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.850
I've been doing that,
those dialects for a long time.

43
00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:41.470
I'm trying to actually move out of the whole United Kingdom cause too easy.

44
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.090
So I've been trying to go to like other parts of the world,
you know.

45
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.070
What are you,
where are you looking?
Um,

46
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.500
there are some Baltic stuff that I've been working on.
Okay.
Yeah.
Uh,

47
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.450
so like an example,
it'd be like a

48
00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.873
good,

49
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.910
so that would be wow.
Yeah.

50
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.690
Well I mean you sounded just like a relative.

51
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:15.060
I could have like an 80 year old man in a small village.

52
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.440
Wow.
And you know,

53
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:20.560
honestly I was working with my dialect coach other day and he was like,

54
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.650
you picked that up immediately.
You don't even have to try it.

55
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.700
You have such a finely tuned ear.
Where do you practice?

56
00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:32.680
I've never seen you practice.
Right.
And come in here and pitch perfect.

57
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.480
I designed to the studio because we had the,

58
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.470
the good fortune of having a musician here before us.

59
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.010
So both are using our instruments.

60
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.560
I saw some interview you did,
um,
on youtube and you were like,
oh,

61
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:51.240
we have a professional studio.
The guy that used to score,
you know,

62
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.640
movies and now we talk about farts in there.
So it's kind of neat.

63
00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.220
He would really wasn't accomplished guy.
Oh my God.
Yeah.

64
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.250
And he had big time artists in here.
I know.
Now we're like,

65
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.450
you can't just drink home.
You got to wash your face with it too.
Yeah.
So stick.

66
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.470
Hang.
Yeah.
Well let's get our stupidity going.
Okay.
Yeah.
Here we go.

67
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.950
So much to go through your mom's house.

68
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.570
I'm your host and dear leader,
Tom Segura,

69
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.050
and she is the fart mistress.

70
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.140
Christina P,
right?
Is that how you want it to be?
Yeah.

71
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.860
The,
yeah,
the Fart.
mistress.com.
We restart.
We still have that one.

72
00:05:32.861 --> 00:05:36.280
We still have it.
I'm trying to get my mom to do it.
Yeah.
What happened with that?

73
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.500
We'll get into it.
I feel like the holidays came.

74
00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:41.920
We got a little baby jeans got off of her more money I think,

75
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.130
whereas it out right now.
Uh,
no.
That's just for me.
It's not,

76
00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:48.340
we're not going to solicit money.
I'm just off.
What?
What's the dollar amount?

77
00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:52.700
I think I offered her a couple of thousand dollars.
She's like,
I'm not there.

78
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.100
Yeah.
Just fart on camera a few times.
Yeah,
it's not,
it's not a prostitute at all.

79
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.750
That's not a first little bit of a prostituted farts to toot.

80
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.810
I that's not,
and I don't feel like that's prostitution.

81
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.910
You wouldn't do those for you to do that for free.

82
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.200
You do the other thing for free too.
Well,
yeah,
I guess so.

83
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.350
But uh,
it's not,
it's not illegal,
you know,
farting for money.
Is that illegal?

84
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.100
It's not illegal.
Right.
But fucking for money is so there you go.

85
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.310
There's a legal distinction to be had.
Interesting point.
Interesting point.

86
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:28.580
You always have a point and you can do it in public and get a fart anywhere.

87
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.720
<v 4>Dean and Christy parade,</v>

88
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.160
devout Christians and they found it on youtube way of spreading God's word

89
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:38.660
through swinging.

90
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:43.730
Yeah.

91
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.130
<v 0>Yeah.
Is This UK master of accents?
Ah,
no,
I don't think so.</v>

92
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.160
They have such a Florida vibe to them,
nor the,
it sounded,

93
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:06.190
oh maybe it's just the announcer was I liked that guy's cool pink hair and

94
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:09.110
they're all into like their training fitness levels.

95
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.500
You can tell they're really in,
you know,
bodybuilding.
Yeah.

96
00:07:12.501 --> 00:07:14.750
And I like this guy's shirt.
It's kind of muted.

97
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:19.670
It's just like a subtle bright neon green.
What color is his hair?

98
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:24.020
That's like Fuchsia.
That's cool.
Cause he's like,
what is he 60 something?

99
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.860
That's the time to dye your hair.
A few show when you were a man.

100
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.850
And then the other guy he's got,
he's also,
it hits the gym for sure.

101
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.930
Yeah.
Yeah.
A couple of dads and they're in total dad gear too.

102
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:40.520
They got the cargo shorts with the functional pockets.
I gotta be honest.

103
00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:44.360
Religious swinging is totally new to me.
I'm,
I didn't know I would,

104
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.690
this is one I wish my parents had gotten it.
If they liked the religious part.

105
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:52.070
Yeah.
They never did the swinging.
I wonder how they're connecting those dots.

106
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.070
Cause Jen early monogamy is the,
the norm.
Yeah,

107
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.340
you know,
we'll see what happens.

108
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:03.270
<v 4>If I was a breeze,
go into a swingers club.
Would you listen to me?</v>

109
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.140
You've got a better chance to listen to them.

110
00:08:05.141 --> 00:08:08.700
They read in the word of God being another swinger.
Still a sin.

111
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:13.230
It's just how are you using right now?
This is God's plan.

112
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.413
Um,

113
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.580
<v 0>I didn't know that.
I didn't know she had the streets.</v>

114
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.270
I know we were talking about blonde hair with blue streaks.

115
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.030
Is that what you're hung up on?

116
00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:30.770
Because I'm just saying she does have blonde hair with blue streaks.
Pink.

117
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:35.870
Yeah.
And he has like purple.
It looks great.
It looks good.

118
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:41.180
Both bodybuilders.
Oh,
that's the no,
you think you can see that?

119
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.160
Yeah.
Cause I don't know.

120
00:08:43.161 --> 00:08:48.161
I'm a little hung up on her non-binary expression expression.

121
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:53.180
I'm just saying that the voice doesn't match the Oh,
that's the extra test off.

122
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.900
That's what happens when your body build.
You get a lot of testosterone.

123
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.750
That's what we were telling some of the girls sound like me.

124
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.580
My name is Amanda and I'm a ball hog.
Yeah,

125
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.800
that's what we're talking about at lunch yesterday.

126
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:08.760
That's what I was trying to remember.

127
00:09:08.761 --> 00:09:12.570
You were looking at pictures of this female bodybuilder and we were,

128
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:16.920
and I was like,
would you ever,
what would you do if I took up bodybuilding?

129
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.550
It would be a lot to you.
It's not the physicality of it.

130
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.140
I mean there's some beautiful female bodybuilders.
They,

131
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.370
some people really like the extremes of the super muscular at,

132
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:30.480
that's a little much for me,

133
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:34.530
but I'm saying there's some beautiful women doing it.
It's the lifestyle.

134
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.460
If you're a spouse,
if you're not into it,

135
00:09:36.461 --> 00:09:39.900
it's like any other lifestyle choice because there's so dedicated,

136
00:09:39.901 --> 00:09:44.901
like it's your life 24 seven you don't become super yolked and lean like that

137
00:09:46.981 --> 00:09:50.400
unless you're always on top of like weighing your food,

138
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.490
you're doing your three workouts a day or whatever and you know you had like,

139
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.331
I didn't do lats,

140
00:09:56.331 --> 00:10:00.090
I got to get back in there and then you get your cardio and it would just be

141
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.330
such an all,
you either have to be,

142
00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:07.830
the spouse has to be the all in their support coach type,

143
00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:11.340
like where I'm prepping your food for you.
Like I love that.
She does this shit.

144
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:15.990
I get her chicken and stuff ready every day.
Flavor list,

145
00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:21.180
fried chicken breasts or it has to be the partner who's doing it totally with

146
00:10:21.181 --> 00:10:22.980
you.
Just by the way,
the same.

147
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:28.040
The same applies to if you were growing weed at the house or something.

148
00:10:29.731 --> 00:10:34.710
It's like I have to either be supportive of you or doing it with you and I were

149
00:10:34.711 --> 00:10:38.940
dieting together like we were both doing.
You were doing Paleo,
right?
Sorry.
Quito.

150
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.960
It was like on the primal diet.
It's similar so we could support each other.
Yeah,

151
00:10:42.961 --> 00:10:45.180
exactly.
We didn't have bad stuff around the house.

152
00:10:45.181 --> 00:10:49.260
Like I wouldn't bring in like I feel like I got,
I got a brown,
he's 24 seven.

153
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.960
Um,
yes it is.
It is quite a dedicated lifestyle choice.

154
00:10:54.961 --> 00:10:55.650
Holy Moly.

155
00:10:55.650 --> 00:11:00.450
How long do you think you would take me to get my body and like bodybuilder?

156
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.440
Female shape.
13 years.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you.
I'm serious.

157
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.950
Especially a female body to strip your body if it's funny.

158
00:11:07.951 --> 00:11:10.020
A lot of women and some men I've heard,

159
00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:12.690
but you usually hear the women say it more,

160
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:18.020
they're scared to lift a weight because they think they will turn like the

161
00:11:18.861 --> 00:11:23.850
muscular and it's like you don't understand how much you would have to do for

162
00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:25.440
how long to look like that.

163
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:29.790
It's not going to happen in a few months of you picking up weights.

164
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:33.600
I used to think that that's why I wouldn't do any kinds of weight weight

165
00:11:33.601 --> 00:11:37.230
training whenever now that I do,
I do polities now.
But yeah,

166
00:11:37.231 --> 00:11:40.530
I was so afraid of looking too muscular as if that could ever happen.

167
00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:45.360
Never happened.
If you were so into it that you were doing it,
you know,

168
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:49.510
five days a week for years,
like some of those people that,

169
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.600
that get the really,
really,

170
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:56.380
really yolked super so crazy or years into doing that.
And you,

171
00:11:56.381 --> 00:12:00.970
the injections,
I imagine you kind of have to do some kind of hormone,
right?
Yeah.

172
00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.950
I mean they have the clean,
um,
you know,

173
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.080
competitions where,
but they look different cause they look at them,

174
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.660
they're not as bulky,
you know?
Right.
Cause that's so hard.
That really is kind of,

175
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.560
I don't know much about,
obviously bodybuilding or nutrition or,
I mean,

176
00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:21.140
but you're kind of deforming yourself a little,
aren't you?
A little bit.
Yeah.

177
00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.670
They have stretch of body dysmorphia.
I mean,
I'll bet some of the was,

178
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:30.130
some of them have it so bad,
you know,
cause I've see,
I love those documentaries.

179
00:12:30.131 --> 00:12:32.290
I've watched them like Lou Ferrigno or whatever.

180
00:12:32.291 --> 00:12:34.420
They always talk about pumping and they're always like,
oh,

181
00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:37.060
I have such puny quads.
Right.
I have such puny,

182
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:42.160
my calves are puny.
And you're like,
oh my God.
No,
they're not brow.

183
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.100
Like those are rocks,
you know?
But they,
oh no,
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:45.101 --> 00:12:47.360
I'm thinking of Jersey Shore.
They're always like,

185
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:52.300
I don't know what you're saying.
Okay.
Yeah.
What's his name?
The dummy.

186
00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:53.411
Well,
that's the thing.

187
00:12:53.411 --> 00:12:57.810
A lot of those gym rats where those juice heads was guerrilla Jews.

188
00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.580
They're all upper body guys.
Right.

189
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.700
They have crazy huge biceps and chest.

190
00:13:03.701 --> 00:13:06.430
And then they had these two little flamingo like sticks.
Yeah.

191
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:08.610
It's so funny you see that all,

192
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:13.060
I see that all the time at the Gold's gym.

193
00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:14.870
Yeah.
Yeah,
it'd be

194
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:21.100
these tiny little legs.
Forget the bottom half.
Yeah,
because they're,

195
00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.660
they're mirror their beach guys.
Like they're,
they're,
they're,

196
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:27.430
they're just in the mirror looking at the upper body.
And then I think about the,

197
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:31.330
but the bodybuilders do it all about proportion.
That's serious.
Serious.

198
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:36.310
They want it to all match up and look now symmetry.
But let's be okay.

199
00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:40.750
Let's be honest.
Um,
aesthetically speaking,
like if I got super jacked,

200
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.010
like instead of those pictures,

201
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:47.740
like where I had no fat like Tom,
Tom,

202
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.720
I'm gonna do triceps.
Just

203
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.730
my trainer's not here yet.

204
00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:59.330
Can you get some avocado kind of slice and going after?
Sure.
Babe,

205
00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.500
you spot me.
I love you.
Oh,

206
00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:09.460
let's do it.
And like sex and stuff.
I mean,
I,
I would be bigger than you for sure.

207
00:14:09.461 --> 00:14:12.430
If you were doing.
Yeah.
I don't know if you'd be bigger,
but you'd be,

208
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:14.840
you'd have so much more muscle.
Yeah.

209
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:19.090
And you'd have to have no fat in their face.
No,

210
00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:23.350
they look kind of like skeletor in the face.
Some of them.
There's no cheeks,

211
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:27.850
cheeks,
no us,
no buts.
I mean you,
I would be fat less.

212
00:14:27.851 --> 00:14:32.140
I would just be like skeletor you know,
but yeah,
but Jack and then,
uh,

213
00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:35.650
and they always tan the Tan is Tim.
Very dark.

214
00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:40.350
Tanning is most of the work is what I've learned.
I did that just,

215
00:14:40.351 --> 00:14:43.090
it just makes you look glowy,
I'm guessing like healthier.

216
00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:47.410
So think it's all about the,
you see the contrast and the muscles more.
Oh,

217
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:51.570
Don dark than you do on fair skin.
Yeah.
Okay.

218
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.850
But looks that you can see where the muscles are.
You know what I mean?

219
00:14:55.851 --> 00:15:00.080
Like they couldn't contortion with a con the,
yeah,

220
00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:04.610
I think you see it more on dark skin.
We're asked to start doing it.

221
00:15:04.611 --> 00:15:07.670
I'm dedicated.
What?
Why don't you just get involved in the tanning part?

222
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.370
I actually do need a Tan.

223
00:15:09.371 --> 00:15:13.640
I saw Nikki Glaser at the store the other day and she looked amazing and she

224
00:15:13.641 --> 00:15:17.570
goes,
Oh,
I got a spray Tan.
You got to try it.
And I'm like,
wow,
that's it.
Like you,

225
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:21.800
she looks healthy and I look like I'm dying.
I don't know if I can do it.

226
00:15:21.801 --> 00:15:23.870
Pragmatic.
Yeah.

227
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.490
Depleted you going to display to and too you want to go?

228
00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.590
I don't know if I can do a pregnant woman.
I went to him.

229
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.660
I'll do fake chompers Dwight.
Perfect smiles.
It's a great look.

230
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:40.520
It's a great,
you gotta get on White,
white,
white by the dedication,

231
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:42.110
the discipline of those peoples.

232
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.560
The bodybuilders cause they are off the charts disciplined.

233
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.650
I mean they wake up at the crack of dawn there in the gym.

234
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:52.790
They you're eating and eating is like the most improved.
Yeah.

235
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:57.470
They eat super clean and they also have to eat a lot of them a lot.
Yeah.

236
00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.670
Yeah.
I remember I watched a documentary on a and we were watching the same one.

237
00:16:01.671 --> 00:16:06.200
That guy in the UK that was a bodybuilder and he's like,
you have to love eating.

238
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:09.860
No,
that wasn't a bodybuilder though.
Those were strong men.
Competition.

239
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:13.980
Those guys.
By the way,
we watched the disaster artist last night.
Yeah,

240
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.560
it was great.
It was funny.
Was good.
James Franco,
I love James Franco.

241
00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.710
He would know he molested people.
Did He molest people?
Something,

242
00:16:21.711 --> 00:16:24.440
I forget his to save you allegedly.

243
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.950
Some kind of Hashtag me too going to the and know they did.

244
00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:33.030
They did report something about it,
but I mean,
I dunno.
I don't think he molests.

245
00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.390
Let's get back to her.
I really liked her feminine.

246
00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:40.010
And you're saying that their voices like mine a little bit.
Yeah.
Yeah.

247
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.880
Let me see that.
She's quite a looker too.
Let's not forget him.

248
00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.600
Please go into a swingers club.
What'd you listen to me?

249
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.110
You've got a better gross.

250
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.510
It's still a sin.
It's just how are you using right now?

251
00:16:56.511 --> 00:17:01.070
This is God's plan
to make me into a man.

252
00:17:01.071 --> 00:17:06.050
There's hormones in there.
We love swimming as a lifestyle.

253
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:08.540
And then it was like,
you know what?

254
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.600
We can do a lot of good with this.

255
00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:16.490
I'm getting the people that probably never will.
That's Florida.

256
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:21.860
Visit a church church.
Oh,
they're gonna.
They're to hold church as a fuck.

257
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.330
I don't know,
but that's what he said.

258
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:28.100
So he's reaching people that he never would have reached without swinging.

259
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.730
It's such a unique approach.
Why are you spending there are so gross.

260
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.580
Like why do they have to be so creepy about it?
You know,

261
00:17:34.581 --> 00:17:38.690
like the girls stroking the other girl's leg and they're like,

262
00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:43.940
oh,
you feel great.
Then they are all about that fucking,
you know.

263
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:48.020
Yeah,
they're gross.
They're always so grody about it.
You think so?
Yeah.

264
00:17:48.021 --> 00:17:51.420
I've never seen a documentary on swingers that I would actually want to swing

265
00:17:51.421 --> 00:17:54.780
with.
That's true.
I watched that one on Netflix,

266
00:17:54.781 --> 00:17:59.280
I forget what it's called and they focus a lot on this British.
There was,

267
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:02.010
I think it was all,
maybe it was all in the UK.
They love it.

268
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:06.000
And there was this one dude,
he looked like a real fucking old school dad.

269
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.580
You had,
you know,
his Khakis and he was like,

270
00:18:08.581 --> 00:18:11.640
we're having swelling and party here tonight.
And um,
you know,

271
00:18:11.641 --> 00:18:16.530
he had his gray mustache and his wife was his second wife,
third wife,

272
00:18:16.531 --> 00:18:20.430
and she was all in that.
She was like,
I think it's great that he feels,
you know,

273
00:18:20.431 --> 00:18:24.840
so liberated and everything and he's basically just like,
I like to fuck man.

274
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.690
You know,
he's the one,
I want to fuck him.

275
00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:31.260
You and I are going to go on a swinging I think eventually.
Yeah.

276
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.650
Once the kid talking about that,
you know,
we have to go to Florida.

277
00:18:34.651 --> 00:18:37.310
That's where they live.
I think you could find a Jackson,
California.

278
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.890
Jacksonville probably has a good population.
We don't have to go to that.

279
00:18:40.891 --> 00:18:42.540
Why don't we just go to Ventura County?
It's not far.

280
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:48.570
You think that's where the swingers are for sure.
Santa Clarita.
Sure.

281
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.210
Anybody out there ready to swing,

282
00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.170
come over and have a couple of drinks.

283
00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:59.970
Oh Gosh,
you have such nice legs.

284
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:04.160
It's all like bags of guys,

285
00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:08.130
shoulders and then they had to talk about their boundaries and there,
you know?

286
00:19:08.131 --> 00:19:09.870
Yeah.
What are you into?
What you got into?
I was like,

287
00:19:09.871 --> 00:19:14.250
shooting a scene allowed to pet your penis,
touch your penis,
ejaculate on me.

288
00:19:14.251 --> 00:19:15.084
Like all that stuff.

289
00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:19.680
We have to go over the rules and stuff and you've got to figure out to condoms.

290
00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:23.850
We're going to do tests.
You know,
it would do blood work before.
Wow.

291
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:28.560
So you go like,
here's my blood work.
She was like,
cool,
I'm down.

292
00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:33.510
It seems like a lot of work.
You want to live the lifestyle or not.

293
00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:37.240
I want to live the lifestyle.
I want to help God.
Praise God.

294
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.260
Let's get got into it today.
True to their word.

295
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:44.550
It's talking about the Bible with their latest swinging partners.
Oh,
like,
well,

296
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:47.790
you know,
you're supposed to be a Christian,
but you're a swing.

297
00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.110
All the swingers are sinners.
What's the best way to talk to the sinners?

298
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.520
The joy and all right.
Oh,

299
00:19:56.310 --> 00:20:00.760
that makes a lot of sense.
These guys are in the gym a lot to a lot.
Oh,

300
00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.960
Johnny's fitness center.
Oh yeah.
That's his jam.
Yeah.

301
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:10.440
What better way to talk about Jesus and to swing this guys,
so just smile.

302
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:12.780
They're both like,
we're not interested in this Christian bullshit.

303
00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:17.340
He's just looking at him.
He's just like,
I'm gonna fuck your wife,
dude.
Stop it.

304
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:22.940
She realizes in the Bible,
gray areas,
it says,

305
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:26.880
I shall not covet thy neighbor's wife,
but what if your neighbor watch you tube?

306
00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:32.310
It's a good point.
Wait a minute.
Where I go and clean my life?

307
00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:36.560
Was
I living?
Hell yeah.

308
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:40.500
I got that on my knees and I prayed to God.
I'm like,

309
00:20:40.501 --> 00:20:45.270
please help.
I was,
no,

310
00:20:45.271 --> 00:20:49.450
I didn't expect that turn.
I didn't either.
There's a lot of that though,
right?

311
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.360
Um,
the,
the Bible,

312
00:20:52.361 --> 00:20:55.750
after you go clean and fitness,

313
00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:01.390
fitness is like I am clean now.
I've got all this fucking energy.

314
00:21:01.391 --> 00:21:06.070
I've got to do something with it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So true.
I stopped drinking.

315
00:21:06.071 --> 00:21:10.450
Now I have to play 10 hours of basketball a day,
seven days a week.
So I do,

316
00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:15.730
I've got to find something man.
He had to find her passion.
She's a little,

317
00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:20.410
she's like,
are you going to fucking right now a lot of nail work there too.

318
00:21:20.411 --> 00:21:22.840
She's one of those broads that like every meals different.

319
00:21:22.841 --> 00:21:26.980
I mean that's got to take hours to do right time cause I get my nails done and

320
00:21:26.981 --> 00:21:29.650
I'm like just one color.
Come on dude,
I don't have all fucking day.

321
00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:34.620
You don't understand the Florida lifestyle fair.
That's all.

322
00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.330
That's all there they go,
they're pumping.

323
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:41.350
She happened to have a female friend there and I get in the showers,
you know,

324
00:21:41.351 --> 00:21:45.430
start showering after work and next thing I know they're both in the shower with

325
00:21:45.431 --> 00:21:48.940
me.
You know,
I didn't know what was going on,
but soon the swinging lifestyle,

326
00:21:48.941 --> 00:21:52.070
the cow off their marriage,
they got they,

327
00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:55.450
they showered at work together.
Is that what understand?
No,

328
00:21:55.451 --> 00:22:00.451
he got home from work and he went to shower and she had a female friend over a

329
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.880
female.
Why can't he say your girlfriend was over?
I don't know.

330
00:22:03.881 --> 00:22:06.460
It's weird when people specify like that.
It's like prisoners,

331
00:22:06.461 --> 00:22:10.060
they talk like that.
She got it was a female and a male.

332
00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:17.350
Yeah,
it's weird.
It's weird to make that distinction like,
Hey,

333
00:22:17.351 --> 00:22:20.200
I'm strictly girl,
boy.
You know,

334
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.380
speaking of prisoners can't get enough of that show,

335
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:28.710
but it is starting to be more and more upsetting though because I find myself

336
00:22:29.021 --> 00:22:32.320
getting angry every time I watch certain people on that show.

337
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.940
My favorite is the woman who was bringing home the convicted felon of 18 years

338
00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:41.380
with the robbery,
with a deadly weapon.
Assault.
Robbery.
Yeah.

339
00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:45.970
Robbery.
And she's got three,
three children at home and she's like,

340
00:22:45.971 --> 00:22:48.610
instant Daddy,
here's your new dad.
Why don't you like him?
I'm like,

341
00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:52.030
you really need psychological help.
God Damn,
she's really messed up.

342
00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.820
And our kids are smarter than she is.
The kids are like far smarter.

343
00:22:54.821 --> 00:22:56.080
He's a convicted felon.

344
00:22:56.110 --> 00:23:00.400
We don't know him and we don't want him to be our instant dad.
And she's like,

345
00:23:00.401 --> 00:23:04.500
you don't want to,
you know,
excited to see them.
And they're like,
no,
no.

346
00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:08.470
She's like,
he's excited to meet you guys.
And they're like,
that's great.

347
00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:14.320
I'm not excited to meet him.
He's a new dad.
What is it?
Love lockup.

348
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:16.270
So good.

349
00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:20.140
Well I remember my mother met my step dad through a singles ad in the back of

350
00:23:20.141 --> 00:23:22.660
the Indian newspaper.
Yeah.
She liked Indian guys.

351
00:23:22.661 --> 00:23:27.661
So she put an ad out buxom European woman seeks a wealthy Indian husband.

352
00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.320
They know.
And we got a bag of,
of letters of course.

353
00:23:32.321 --> 00:23:35.830
Cause Buxom Blonde European woman is like the lead.

354
00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.120
So out of all the photographs she chooses him cause he's wearing an Armani suit

355
00:23:40.121 --> 00:23:45.121
next to his Mercedes on a cell phone back in the nineties and I to God,

356
00:23:45.621 --> 00:23:48.970
they got married one month later.
Brick phone.

357
00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.430
Yeah.
And they were drug dealer.
Yeah.

358
00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.470
He fucking total drug to a hundred thousand percent yeah.

359
00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:01.460
So there could talk on the phone,
Bro.
Yeah,

360
00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:04.940
and I would talk to him on the phone occasionally.
Like,
Oh hey,

361
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:10.340
I have three daughters.
One of them is into goth music too.
And I was like,
great.

362
00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.790
And a month later we were at the courthouse in downtown La.

363
00:24:13.791 --> 00:24:17.570
Same thing like this is your meet your new daddy.
But I actually liked him,

364
00:24:17.571 --> 00:24:20.630
so thank goodness you know anything to get away from my mom.

365
00:24:20.631 --> 00:24:21.680
Anything to take the photos.

366
00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:27.520
So this guy's getting out of prison or no other way it works or why it works or

367
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:28.780
why worship.

368
00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:33.260
Was it like bank fraud or insider trading?

369
00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:38.150
It was robbery with a deadly,
it's a very violent violet crown.

370
00:24:38.151 --> 00:24:43.010
I want him to be the new man in your life.
That is an interesting thing.

371
00:24:43.011 --> 00:24:45.950
When it's your role model,
you're dead.
You really a thinker.

372
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:48.530
You have good ideas,

373
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:54.970
good maternal instinct to protect your kids to like where's the maternal

374
00:24:55.131 --> 00:24:56.940
instinct to protect.
That's what I'm saying.

375
00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:00.440
I'm watching this like you want that man around your children.

376
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:03.980
He's going to teach them how to make toilet wine.
Baby was fine.
And she's like,

377
00:25:03.981 --> 00:25:07.910
why aren't you guys excited?
You know what I'm saying?

378
00:25:07.911 --> 00:25:11.530
Here's how you lift weights.
He said,

379
00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:15.170
you bench press using nothing but your own body's resistance.
He's a,
he's like,

380
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:19.340
oh my God,
guys fucked up.
They're all fucked up.
Of course.

381
00:25:19.341 --> 00:25:22.070
Who's dating a fucking felon dude,
you're crazy.

382
00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.340
That's not good.
Yeah.
It's funny though.
It's fun to watch.
Fun to get mad.
I know.

383
00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:33.320
Yeah,
you do.
And then I get mad.
I get mad more at the civilians,

384
00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:36.950
not at the prisoners.
The prisoners are actually trying to get their lives.

385
00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.040
They're actually trying to meet the parole,
uh,
needs and get jobs.

386
00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:43.700
They're actually all doing what they're supposed to be doing.
And the,

387
00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.450
the civilians are like,
why aren't we married yet?
Remember crazy God,

388
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:53.640
he does every interview.
He's like,
he's like,
ah,

389
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:59.140
um,
I or we're going to have a great time together.
Yeah.

390
00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:02.150
And people who don't like it then they can get out of my life.

391
00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:05.240
I don't give a shit they want.
And she's like,
they're always like,

392
00:26:05.241 --> 00:26:07.220
I don't know why she doesn't want to have a baby already.

393
00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:11.690
I think she's only been out of prison for two weeks.
Maybe she needs to adjust.

394
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:16.730
She's clearly using again,
clearly on heroin when her eyes are like,

395
00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.760
after she's like,
what's your problem?
Yeah.

396
00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:22.820
Because it never occurred to me that she might be using their,
well,

397
00:26:22.821 --> 00:26:26.670
from what I understand,
prisons not the place to get clean.
Yeah.
Kind of.

398
00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.300
It's not a resort.
It's not like a Malibu Rehab,
you know?
No,

399
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:32.870
I'd be wanting drugs 24,
seven worse.

400
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:35.830
That's when you started doing drugs or let's get back to swinging.
Yeah.

401
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:41.030
The Bible doesn't talk about sleep,
uh,
specifically as a married couple.

402
00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.010
You agree on something together.
It's okay,

403
00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:48.000
<v 4>but it's not.
Then like I said,
Judgment Day,
I'll find that out.</v>

404
00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:52.760
<v 0>Oh,
okay.
You're well,
she's,
she's like,
well,
it's not in the Bible.</v>

405
00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:56.020
It doesn't say you can't swing.
And Jesus' times,
I'm not sure people were,

406
00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.580
were they swinging back and I'm sure they were,

407
00:26:58.581 --> 00:27:01.490
but now they've sets up a website.
Oh yeah.

408
00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.860
It is for people fucking nails,

409
00:27:03.861 --> 00:27:08.150
man x wingers event and get 10 people that believe in Christ.

410
00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:13.770
Uh,
looking at her,
looking down like I don't know about.
She's like,

411
00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:16.540
I'm into the swinging part of it man.
He's like,

412
00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:19.190
he's trying to find the hole,

413
00:27:19.191 --> 00:27:23.390
the loophole that it's really about spreading the Gospel.
Jesus,

414
00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:27.860
she's like,
she's real shiny.

415
00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:32.030

418
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:43.400
I am not currently involved in lifestyle.

419
00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:46.220
It's never a non possibility.

420
00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:51.650
Wa that's her daughter by the way.
Who's doing how?
Peng fitness swingers site.

421
00:27:51.651 --> 00:27:53.720
Whether it's not,
not a,

422
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:57.950
not a not possibility that she becomes and bald.

423
00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:02.840
The swinging is that one good parenting.
Good religion.
Good,
good,
good.

424
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:04.730
All good.
A lot of bright colors.

425
00:28:04.731 --> 00:28:09.400
These few people got bright colors and the poor daughter.
Yeah,

426
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:12.860
she's,
I enter the lifestyle.
She's I at know either lifestyle,

427
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:15.830
the lifestyle lifestyle.

428
00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:19.990
<v 4>So far today God hasn't said,
hey dean stopped us.
It's a sin.</v>

429
00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:23.230
I don't want you to do this.
What are you expecting of till we close that?

430
00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:27.850
I'm going to keep trying to help as many people as we can.
That's what I don't

431
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:31.890
<v 0>like the spin.
Yeah.
This is all about help.
It's all about busted a nut,</v>

432
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:36.330
which I'm not mad at.
I'm mad at you,
but don't,
don't make God the pimp.
You know,

433
00:28:36.331 --> 00:28:40.200
he should play this for your parents and see if they agree with Catholicism,
Dad,

434
00:28:40.201 --> 00:28:44.990
and know you're going to retire soon.
Have you thought about expanding and

435
00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.980
maybe bringing,
spreading God the message of the Lord in a different way?

436
00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:54.810
You know,
uh,
unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

437
00:28:55.110 --> 00:29:00.090
Um,
oh,
can I,
can we pull out the article I sent you?
Oh yeah.

438
00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:04.680
So I got the sense to me from my friend Eric.

439
00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:09.980
Apparently there's a man who's chosen to live as a Dalmatian.

440
00:29:12.541 --> 00:29:14.720
A 32 year old man has taken it,

441
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:19.490
has decided to live as a domesticated Dalmatian.
Uh Oh,

442
00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:24.150
Tom Peters told U K is this morning while he uses his real name,

443
00:29:24.151 --> 00:29:27.570
when he works at his job as a lighting and theater technician.

444
00:29:27.571 --> 00:29:31.980
He likes to be referred to as spot.
When he transforms into a puppy.

445
00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:37.230
Peter said is Dalmatian costume helps them transform into his persona of a

446
00:29:37.231 --> 00:29:40.640
puppy,
which is a lifestyle he is fully committed to.
He sleep.

447
00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:47.690
He sleeps in an enclosure,
walks on all fours and eats from a dog bowl.

448
00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.560
Will you scroll down a bit further?
Yeah.
Here's my favorite part,

449
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:56.350
which you guys are all going to appreciate.
Yeah.
On,
hold on.
Uh,

450
00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.153
<v 4>okay.</v>

451
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:04.240
<v 0>Peter added that contrary to popular belief,
people who chose,</v>

452
00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:08.500
chose to live their lives as dogs aren't doing it to cause mischief or sexual

453
00:30:08.501 --> 00:30:12.340
pleasure,
but rather to have fun and literally be treated like a puppy.

454
00:30:12.341 --> 00:30:15.130
It is not a sexual thing.
It's a lifestyle.

455
00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:20.110
It's just escapism to get away from fund a n,

456
00:30:20.111 --> 00:30:22.390
d and the frenetic life.
We have

457
00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.350
<v 4>said,
fine.
You started locking I guess money.</v>

458
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.390
It's not sexual guys.
Oh,
sure.

459
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.640
Oh,
look at you.

460
00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:38.110
<v 0>My is like that.
No,</v>

461
00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:42.060
<v 4>please.
You don't have a title.
Oh No,
no.</v>

462
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:44.120
I don't like this puppy.

463
00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:51.880
Yeah.
Push down on that if you think it's been so.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.

464
00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:53.710
Oh,
not sexual.

465
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:57.480
<v 0>Tom,
what's,
what was sexual about that in the least?</v>

466
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:58.663
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

467
00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:03.760
you've come because you need to tail revenue shared hoppy.

468
00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:06.840
Yeah.
It's just the tower you'd lock us.
We'll give you

469
00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:11.510
and then cause your last choice.

470
00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:14.290
<v 0>Okay.
So this is this.
Oh,</v>

471
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:18.120
scroll up and see if we owe on the loan side advertising and as you're being

472
00:31:18.121 --> 00:31:22.650
heard.
Ah,
well the,
the,
the lead photo,
she doesn't look too happy.

473
00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:26.340
If you look at the photograph of two of them.
No,
she doesn't look happy.

474
00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:31.380
Uh,
I,
it doesn't say where they live,
if that's you.

475
00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:35.040
That's what I'm saying.
Like,
okay,
what'd you hate?
So I'm like,
Babe,

476
00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.070
we're Dalmatian 24,
seven.
I want to,

477
00:31:38.071 --> 00:31:41.820
when I'm home I want to be a dog and I have to create you at night and stuff.

478
00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.970
And you got to tell our son like a dad.
He's a dog.

479
00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:48.920
<v 4>Oh,
oh,</v>

480
00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:58.050
oh so nasty with sexual about this dog.

481
00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:01.860
And that's sexual is a lifestyle dog.
Right?

482
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:06.840
<v 0>Uh,
can't have fun.
Okay.
Would you rather,
and I'm like having a good time.</v>

483
00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:11.610
Would you rather become a bodybuilder like full year in it?

484
00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:16.470
You really got to dedicate for a decade or live as a Dalmatian for a decade.

485
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.450
Yeah,
they're both for a decade.
Yeah.

486
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:23.010
We'll see how long it takes to become a dedicated bodybuilder.
Well,
first of all,

487
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:26.010
I mean it's,
it's gotta be bodybuilder.
I'm not excited about it.

488
00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:26.970
I don't want to do it,

489
00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:32.360
but there's no way I could throw myself into the copy lifestyle for a decade.

490
00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:35.910
I mean,
it's just,
it's,
look,
I mean,

491
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.530
I would never work again if I was a puppy.

492
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.730
You might like it boarding flights and I'd be like,

493
00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:45.140
you have to sit under the seat.

494
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.080
I'm my own emotional.

495
00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:51.993
<v 4>Cool.</v>

496
00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.520
<v 0>What is it in emotional needs,
dog?
No,</v>

497
00:32:54.521 --> 00:32:57.360
Dean's door I'd bring you on is my emotional needs.
Puppy.

498
00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.510
<v 4>You can sit on my lap.
Okay.
Very tight down there on Chicago.</v>

499
00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:02.820
Very tired.

500
00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:06.750
But you could sleep with Fifo and Betsy and I could feed the three of you at the

501
00:33:06.751 --> 00:33:10.320
same time.
We really easy.
It'd be great.
Oh,

502
00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:12.600
how do presets wrapping up the kid at school?

503
00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.500
<v 0>That'd be so pissed about bodybuilding.</v>

504
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:20.010
That's the one thing I definitely don't want to do.
I'm going to come on.
I know.

505
00:33:20.011 --> 00:33:23.000
It's so hard.
It's just too hard.
It's,
I don't want to do it hard.

506
00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:25.470
You don't want it.
Don't want to do it.

507
00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.870
<v 4>Oh,
hold on.
Hold on.
Papi,</v>

508
00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.690
Papi,
he's going to k

509
00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:42.590
<v 0>nothing as gross as it.
Nothing in the world can be as gross as a man can be.</v>

510
00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:46.550
There's never women doing this.
It's never like never cute.
Girls being like,

511
00:33:46.551 --> 00:33:50.960
I want to be a dog.
I want you to put a tale in my,
but no,
it's no worries guys.

512
00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:54.440
Yeah.
Why are guys so discussed as being like,
I'm want to be a dog.

513
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:57.740
Make sure we're at and we pretend we're at the vet and I need a tail,

514
00:33:57.741 --> 00:34:00.520
but really you just shoved this dildo up my ass hole and it,

515
00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:03.590
we'll call it a tale.
Why are they such savages?
Tom?

516
00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:05.990
What's going on with you guys?
We're just fucked up,
man.

517
00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:10.820
I don't know why this is just like a misdirected sexual energy,
you know?
Yeah.

518
00:34:10.821 --> 00:34:13.790
Maybe it's,
it's a frustrated sexual energy because you don't have,

519
00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:17.040
you don't have immediate access to women or men or whatever.
Man,

520
00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:19.190
I think it has a lot to do with,
you know,

521
00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:23.660
at some point this guy wanted to express some sexual thing,

522
00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:28.130
some kink and you oppressed and repressed it and then you keep her pressing it

523
00:34:28.131 --> 00:34:32.810
and then maybe he teases it once to someone and he gets shot down.

524
00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:36.560
So then it goes back to being bottled up,
bottled up.
And then one day he's like,

525
00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:41.180
I'm going to live life as a dog.
And then you guys just fucking put me in a cage.

526
00:34:41.181 --> 00:34:45.380
And it goes to an extreme.
Yeah.
Cause it's also,
there's nothing wrong.

527
00:34:45.381 --> 00:34:47.840
I'm not trying to kink shame people,
but

528
00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:53.680
to live your life as a dog is an extreme.
Obviously that's not like,
yeah,

529
00:34:53.681 --> 00:34:57.370
24 seven is a bit much.
I mean I understand,
I understand the,
you know,

530
00:34:57.371 --> 00:35:00.250
recreational maybe on the weekends or wherever the heck yeah.

531
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:05.720
Maybe women too in society haven't really been as encouraged to explore there.

532
00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:06.733
That's true.

533
00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:11.620
So maybe in another generation or two and there is a lot of kink shaming on

534
00:35:11.621 --> 00:35:16.070
probably either side you mean?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well women don't even admit to,
yeah.

535
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:18.340
You know,
simple thing guys,

536
00:35:18.341 --> 00:35:22.750
when they're young are told basically don't be weird.
Yeah.

537
00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.940
Well everyone's told.
Oh right.
Yeah,
I think so,

538
00:35:24.941 --> 00:35:29.790
but I'm saying so you need to like healthy encouragement.
Yeah.

539
00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:31.660
Of Your Shit.
Things like this.

540
00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:36.760
<v 4>Cool.
Oh,
good puppy spin around.
Spin around.</v>

541
00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:41.890
Let's you from the front.
I'm an af copy.

542
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.350
Yeah.
You put a tail.
No,
please.

543
00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:51.190
I don't want the tail towed away.
I think about my sweet little dog.

544
00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:56.290
<v 0>No,
I'm a dog lover.
Anyways,
new topic.</v>

545
00:35:57.310 --> 00:36:01.330
You and I have been having social dinners very early lately.

546
00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.570
That's um,
part of our new lifestyle.

547
00:36:04.571 --> 00:36:07.870
Some people are in the spending and Jesus and we're into going to bed.

548
00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:12.430
So I'm into it.
I'm into it to you.

549
00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.450
You fucking,
I was a late night guy for so long.
You know,

550
00:36:16.451 --> 00:36:20.080
our whole relationship.
It was all what you've been going to bed.
And I'd be like,

551
00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:23.500
I'll see you when I see you,
man.
I would be up till two,

552
00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:27.500
three in the morning and the raccoons.
Ooh.
Wow.

553
00:36:27.501 --> 00:36:29.500
That out then,
whatever.

554
00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:34.530
And that was just life in this human boy came into our house has just changed.

555
00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.630
But I miss,
I miss having sleep.
So yeah,
you got to,

556
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:42.670
you got to kind of move to his schedule.
I need to be home early.

557
00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:46.300
I don't like this late night.
I don't eat or it doesn't work for us anymore.

558
00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:51.480
So we had dinner with some business friends and as a joke I throughout 6:00 PM I

559
00:36:52.751 --> 00:36:56.530
was like there's no way he's gonna even five 30 I think I threw out there,

560
00:36:56.531 --> 00:37:01.180
I was like five 36 and you typed it into the group texts,
you're like yeah,

561
00:37:01.181 --> 00:37:03.100
six o'clock I was like babe,
I'm kidding.

562
00:37:03.101 --> 00:37:05.780
Nobody eats dinner at six except us privately.

563
00:37:05.781 --> 00:37:09.640
Like we'll go down to the steak house in the neighborhood and eat at six
o'clock.

564
00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:14.860
We do.
Yeah.
But the guy agreed he did and he and his wife,

565
00:37:14.861 --> 00:37:17.980
they have the three children right to add to along the way.

566
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:22.840
And they loved it too.
They were like,
great,
this is great.

567
00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:28.320
Well I love it when you get home in time to watch your show kind of mellow out.

568
00:37:30.011 --> 00:37:31.870
Cause if you go to the eight o'clock dinner,

569
00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:36.430
forget it when you're home at 10 30 or it's late now I go right to sleep.

570
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:39.640
I can't watch my love after lock up.
That's right.
Can't have it.

571
00:37:39.641 --> 00:37:43.270
But you know the tree treat little snack.
Now this is just perfect Tommy.

572
00:37:43.271 --> 00:37:45.730
And it's good because the restaurant's still empty.
Yeah,

573
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.730
you're there right before the dinner rush.
I don't mind it.

574
00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:52.270
I don't mind it either.
It's a little embarrassing.

575
00:37:52.271 --> 00:37:56.410
It makes getting up tolerable too because you know,

576
00:37:56.770 --> 00:38:01.760
I've had to adapt and now I get up every day around seven yes.
You know,

577
00:38:01.761 --> 00:38:06.060
I,
cause I made plans with my mom friends and these are the two girls I,

578
00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:07.120
I grew up with,

579
00:38:07.121 --> 00:38:11.920
went to school with and they were my sluttiest drinkingest friends.
Right.

580
00:38:11.921 --> 00:38:13.940
So these two slots,
they're like,
Yay,

581
00:38:13.941 --> 00:38:18.310
let's have dinner at nine and a,
and I was like,
Yo,

582
00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:22.420
I mean can we get that down to eight and then I'll be in the car,

583
00:38:22.421 --> 00:38:26.470
I'll be coming ubering home at 10 you know what I'm saying?
That these two slots,

584
00:38:26.471 --> 00:38:28.810
they stay out till one,
two in the morning.
I'm like,
yeah,

585
00:38:28.811 --> 00:38:30.640
but you got to wake up with your baby.
They had,
you know,

586
00:38:30.641 --> 00:38:34.850
one and a half year olds at the time.
Oh,
you guys are fucking nuts.
Hung over it.

587
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:38.660
They just,
they punish themselves and they take care of the baby over,

588
00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.600
which I can't.
I just can't.
I just can't do it

589
00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:45.190
physically capable.
I don't want to,
I don't.

590
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:49.630
Why can't I get drunk at 7:00 PM I can still get drunk.

591
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.000
Let's just move it up.
It started six bro,

592
00:38:52.001 --> 00:38:57.001
and then I'm in bed by 10 I don't have to start at 10 and your fucking mind if,

593
00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:59.050
if we're doing a road thing,

594
00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:04.240
do a late out night and then have to get up early to like,
oh,
fuck that bro.

595
00:39:04.241 --> 00:39:06.400
I can't do that shit.
No,
no,
no,
no.

596
00:39:06.401 --> 00:39:10.320
I either have to move my flight or just not do this.
Yeah,
no,

597
00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.880
you got to go to sleep.
Sleep,
sleep,
number one.

598
00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:17.090
Number one is at the top of the list of things I need.
Yup.

599
00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.940
Put me in a good mood.
I can't function.
No,
I dunno.

600
00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:23.590
There's these people that do the three or four hours.

601
00:39:23.591 --> 00:39:25.630
They not these folks I would they say is like that.

602
00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:30.510
Some celebrities that they said,
oh,
I heard the Chappelle is like that.
Right.

603
00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.410
I was at the escalation like that.

604
00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:37.570
Chris Rock and Chappelle were there and they were doing the same show in the

605
00:39:37.571 --> 00:39:39.400
belly room,
the little ADC room,

606
00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:43.330
and I was talking to one of the guys that traveled with him a lot.
He's like,

607
00:39:43.331 --> 00:39:47.190
yeah,
you know,
he's looking at a Taurus late night guy and I go also.

608
00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.880
Then he just goes to,
you know,
he's like,

609
00:39:48.881 --> 00:39:53.550
we do a lot of 6:00 AM 7:00 AM stay up til six or 7:00 AM should me.

610
00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:57.100
No Way.
And then I go,
but then like you guys sleep all that.
He's like,
no,

611
00:39:57.130 --> 00:40:01.450
that's the crazy part is that he'll be up at like nine or 10 he just needs a few

612
00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:03.250
hours.
I mean,
I envy these people.

613
00:40:03.251 --> 00:40:06.310
I've always wished I wear that type that didn't need to sleep.

614
00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:10.300
I slept three or four,
I'm fine,
I'm great.
And then go play sports.
The next day I,

615
00:40:10.301 --> 00:40:14.470
it's just not my constitution.
Life exhausts me so much.

616
00:40:14.471 --> 00:40:17.800
Like I just got exhausted.
I'm sick right now and I'm,

617
00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:19.860
my theory is still that it,

618
00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:23.080
that it happened when I got bad sleep.

619
00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.770
I went to bed real late the other night and I had to get up and I could feel

620
00:40:26.771 --> 00:40:27.880
myself breaking down.

621
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:32.960
I don't know how he's going to do it if I don't rest enough and forgetting to

622
00:40:32.961 --> 00:40:35.400
get second smokers smoking's no good.
I know,

623
00:40:35.401 --> 00:40:37.180
but he's still is like just going fine.

624
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.740
I know some people are genetically freak so,
um,

625
00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:45.100
my father had a friend,
the guy is dead now so I can talk about it.

626
00:40:45.101 --> 00:40:49.000
I'm hoping it was just wired that way too.

627
00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:53.440
Like this dude with slave,
like he would party,
right?
Like the card,

628
00:40:53.441 --> 00:40:57.130
like you name it.
That guy was doing it and sleep three or four hours.

629
00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:59.440
No wait guy.
I can do,
I can do,

630
00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:03.970
I like being up late but I have to be able to sleep of course.

631
00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:04.990
But then he'd wake up,

632
00:41:04.991 --> 00:41:09.050
go play soccer because he leaves a Hungarian guy and he loved to play soccer.

633
00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:12.580
Fucking a and then all day like do whatever.
Like you're crazy.

634
00:41:12.581 --> 00:41:15.970
You remember when I used to work the graveyard shift so that was very bad for

635
00:41:15.971 --> 00:41:16.990
you.
It was really bad.

636
00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:20.920
And so I was up very bad shift would end around like 6:00 AM I think.

637
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:23.290
Ooh that's 7:00 AM that's tough.

638
00:41:23.291 --> 00:41:27.490
One I would go home and you know you hit like weird second wins and I would have

639
00:41:27.491 --> 00:41:32.230
to do something to kind of wind down and then I would go to bed and I mean I

640
00:41:32.231 --> 00:41:33.064
would sleep

641
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:38.130
<v 5>sometimes an hour before I had to go back to work.
Go.
Yeah.</v>

642
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:41.000
And I was telling one of the guys I worked with and he was like why do you sleep

643
00:41:41.001 --> 00:41:43.460
so much?
What?
He's like,

644
00:41:43.461 --> 00:41:47.000
yeah just cause he was also in the graveyard and he was like yeah I just said a

645
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.960
few hours and then I'm like,
oh wish I,
I'm falling apart.

646
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:54.410
That was falling apart and that would go in the edit bays cause it was an a post

647
00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:59.411
production place and I would fall asleep on one of the Anti Edit Bay couches.

648
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:04.220
And this guy one time an editor junior at a assistant editor came in,

649
00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:09.640
it was like,
man you're,
you're snoring.
We can hear it down though.
Of course.

650
00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:13.890
I was like,
cause it was three 30 or four in the morning and I was just know.

651
00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:16.530
<v 0>Well plus it messes up your metabolism.</v>

652
00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.450
Everything you eat when you're not eating it,

653
00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.310
you shouldn't be eating it three or four in the morning.

654
00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:21.840
It slows everything down.

655
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:24.980
<v 5>That's when I first started to put on weight.
Yeah,
he was doing that.</v>

656
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.140
That shift actually.
Yeah,
of course.

657
00:42:27.141 --> 00:42:31.010
I went into that thing around 200 pounds,
you know,

658
00:42:31.011 --> 00:42:32.930
like one 95 200 pounds when I,

659
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:37.990
when I started working in those jobs and like after six months of doing crazy

660
00:42:38.541 --> 00:42:42.810
shifts and then graveyard shift that was 25 pounds heavier.
No,
yeah,

661
00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.380
<v 0>sure.
I was gaining weight,
just working the clubs.</v>

662
00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.130
When we remember we were talking about,
Oh,

663
00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:50.690
here's where you and I were on the road,
grinding away,
grinding out weeks.

664
00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:51.950
We would,
this is our,

665
00:42:51.951 --> 00:42:56.450
our schedule back in 2010 was it Tom and I would do this show.
Can we,

666
00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:58.460
we tape your mom's house on Tuesdays.

667
00:42:58.461 --> 00:43:02.090
We both get on planes Wednesdays to go do the clubs.
Yeah.

668
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:05.990
Do shows Wednesday through Sunday.
What they would do is they would have thought,

669
00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:09.330
they would say you have to leave Wednesday to do Thursday morning press press.

670
00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:13.040
Right.
The whole thing's about,
and that's like good morning.
Hard for,

671
00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:17.840
I'm like some,
you know,
some bullshit radio.
None of which ever paid off.

672
00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:21.590
That's why you had to leave on Wednesday to do the Fockers shit.

673
00:43:21.591 --> 00:43:26.591
Fucking local press that nobody who likes what we do ever listens to or watches.

674
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:32.060
No.
Okay,
so then Thursday you're so Wednesday you fly across the country.

675
00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:36.920
Yeah.
Two planes.
Usually we were picking you up at 6:00 AM eastern time.

676
00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:41.540
We're west coast body clock,
so it's three again for us.
Wake up,

677
00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:45.290
take you to these fucking dumps.
Yeah.
Where the guy doesn't care.

678
00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:46.640
Didn't look up well you,
what do you do?

679
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:50.570
I'll just say I'm Tom's here and just take it from there.
Yeah.
What?

680
00:43:50.571 --> 00:43:52.790
Like they wouldn't know.
It wouldn't look up anything about you.

681
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:57.430
And then you do that press for like three hours.
Then you're like holy shit.

682
00:43:58.180 --> 00:43:59.180
Then you eat breakfast,

683
00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:03.080
then you go to sleep and you would sleep like four or five hours or something.

684
00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:07.200
Then a show Thursday,
sometimes it would have Friday press too.
Right.

685
00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:10.910
They wake you up the next day to do press again.
Two shows Friday two show,

686
00:44:10.911 --> 00:44:13.220
Saturday one show Sunday.
Yes.

687
00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:18.140
All that fly back home Monday.
Sometimes on a connecting flight.
Yeah.

688
00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:21.770
So now you're back in la ideally by two,

689
00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:26.540
two or 3:00 PM if you're lucky.
That's a good one.
Yeah.
We get home.

690
00:44:26.541 --> 00:44:30.020
We'd get the dog.
Cause at the time we just had FIFO with this,

691
00:44:30.021 --> 00:44:33.270
this nice man that would watch fief and he'd bring them over.
Uh,

692
00:44:33.271 --> 00:44:38.220
we'd make dinner,
we'd regroup next morning,
wake up,
do your mom's house,

693
00:44:38.221 --> 00:44:42.650
do whatever.
You fucking me.
You know,
things you had to do,
anything we're luck,

694
00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:46.080
unpacked,
do your laundry and everything.
It was terrible.
Lucky,
so hard.

695
00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:51.090
Like I'm staying on the stay at home as we did making those,
fuck,

696
00:44:51.091 --> 00:44:53.700
I'm going out again.
Yeah.
I mean,
but we were,

697
00:44:53.701 --> 00:44:57.240
we were just talking about it that those years when you and I were just like

698
00:44:57.270 --> 00:45:00.830
grinding,
grinding,
grinding,
like you kind of,

699
00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:05.220
we had to do that to get here obviously,
but of course,
but those were the years,

700
00:45:05.221 --> 00:45:07.800
man.
If just I would,
I remember when we lived in Redondo,

701
00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:11.760
I would land at the airport and how it just put my bags down because we lived on

702
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:13.050
less than a mile from the beach.

703
00:45:13.051 --> 00:45:15.440
We rented like this little house and we'll go south.
Yeah.

704
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:19.310
And I will go to the beach and I was just fucking lay on the sand and the field

705
00:45:19.311 --> 00:45:22.650
is sunlight after being in these dark places,
you know,

706
00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:25.470
cause you're nocturnal when you're a comic too.
It's not like you,

707
00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:26.940
I didn't go out during the day,

708
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:32.130
so I would just be in a dark hotel room to go to the club.
Eating,
crying,

709
00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:33.630
drinking.
Good Lord.

710
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:37.260
Thank God those days are over with terrible man making your money.

711
00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:39.240
My name is Alexa and I'm a bell.
Huh?

712
00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:42.570
You can get her to say stuff like that.

713
00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:46.610
<v 5>I mean somebody's got a,
who did this?
What a slut.</v>

714
00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.520
Kelly Kelly from Brooklyn and I had it done.

715
00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:54.600
<v 0>Good job gains.
Is Alexa [inaudible]?
Yeah,
I'm a ball hog.</v>

716
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:57.570
I got a great a great one.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Hi,

717
00:45:57.571 --> 00:45:59.950
I'm Payton Lafferty and Bajans

718
00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:04.100
<v 5>this guy,
I don't know what city this is in.
Um,</v>

719
00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:07.830
this is in Florida,
I think Peyton blast.
Um,

720
00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:13.680
you said he's driving home and he hears this guy on the radio named Jim Fisher,

721
00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:16.800
one of these,
I don't know,
talk radio guys.

722
00:46:16.801 --> 00:46:21.390
And he's rambling on about how transgender people are taking a drug to lactate,

723
00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.930
right.
Oh,
okay.
Cause they want to be able to breastfeed to sure.

724
00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:29.860
So he called in to the show.
Okay.
Um,

725
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:33.510
he says he did call him pancake the IBS champ.

726
00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:38.760
But this is really great.
So he had his,

727
00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:40.950
it's not the most premium audio,

728
00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:44.010
but because he told his friends to record it for them.
So he's like,

729
00:46:44.011 --> 00:46:47.790
there's a couple,
you know,
it's not like super clear.
It's not from the station,

730
00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:51.960
but this is the best.
Uh,
this is just,
this is great.

731
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:55.470
This is him calling into this Guy Jim fresh.
Your show.
Here we go.
Okay.

732
00:46:55.770 --> 00:47:00.600
<v 6>Hi Jan.
Longtime time listener.
I'm pleading Lafferty and I'm a ball hog.
Yeah,</v>

733
00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:05.130
I was born Jamie Laverty.
I'd be going to three ambitions through years ago.

734
00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:10.620
Outline giving you an idea of how we feel in the transgender community about

735
00:47:12.181 --> 00:47:16.740
this
man.
I just talked about it and we thank,
you know,

736
00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:21.770
moms are eating so many GMOs are eating too and things are parasite.

737
00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:26.990
That's not how I want to exceed the genic diet.
No,

738
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.480
I would have married come an oil paint.
That's not true.
Yes it is.

739
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:33.580
No paper.
That's not true.

740
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:37.690
Have you been around a nursing mother anytime in your life?
Yeah,

741
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:41.950
and she was eating Gmos and junk food and all this stuff.

742
00:47:41.951 --> 00:47:45.190
She wasn't careful about what she ate.
Right.
And lose silk and every hallway,

743
00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:52.810
<v 0>loosen everything,
Soup and everything.
Lariat.
God just keeps going.</v>

744
00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:56.890
<v 6>I'm going to raise my children the way I want to and I'm going to raise them</v>

745
00:47:56.891 --> 00:48:01.180
with non gender pronoun.
You used to be,
I gather a guy.

746
00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:06.820
Uh,
yeah.
Okay.
You're not going to have any children.

747
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:09.460
I am.
I'm going to endow.
Okay.

748
00:48:09.461 --> 00:48:13.450
Have you had your plumbing ripped out to know that's why they call me a ball
hog.

749
00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:19.190
<v 0>Your plumbing ripped out.
I mean how,
how rude can,</v>

750
00:48:19.191 --> 00:48:24.160
can't be your plumbing ramps.
I like how disrespectful.
Don't be it.

751
00:48:24.161 --> 00:48:27.720
Yeah.
Oh,
he's totally a dick.
I mean,
I'm a Douche bag and he's,

752
00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:32.500
he's also has that holier than now.
Yeah.
Tones.
Very condescending tone.

753
00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:33.010
Yeah.

754
00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:35.760
<v 6>Fuck.
I'm going to raise my kids the way I want her.
It was my paper.</v>

755
00:48:35.761 --> 00:48:38.810
I'm going to call them when they're born.
Just like in Sweden,

756
00:48:38.811 --> 00:48:41.930
they call all kids hand.
It's a non gender specific shone out.

757
00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:46.630
Once they get to an age where they realize they want to be a Sam or is there or

758
00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.760
hear or see them,
they get and make that place.

759
00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:54.430
<v 0>He's really good at this by,
he's really good at it.
Yeah.
Wow.
Peyton,</v>

760
00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:57.960
you did a really good job.
Gosh.
Yeah.
I mean I would have laughed the whole time.

761
00:48:57.961 --> 00:49:00.180
He didn't laugh at all.
He didn't really good.
He stuck to it.

762
00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:01.650
I think he actually got into character.

763
00:49:01.651 --> 00:49:05.790
I think he was just feels like when you're acting and you really,
when the,

764
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.770
when the choice you make really lines up for you and the Improv is natural.

765
00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:14.340
You don't have to search for it.
It really feels like he became the ball.

766
00:49:14.341 --> 00:49:17.620
Hockey became a ball hog on that.
So good.
I liked that.
He was okay.

767
00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:19.320
<v 6>I want to Quito genic diet.</v>

768
00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:24.920
<v 0>I like that he's on a ketone or she,
excuse me,
page.
Hey.
Yeah.</v>

769
00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:29.000
They didn't specify their pronouns.
Talking.
Yeah.
It was really great.
Good job.

770
00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:32.750
Amaze.
That was,
that was really good.
You know,

771
00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:37.130
you guys in their moves,
soup and everything,

772
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:43.430
that guy sounds like such an asshole.
What a dickhead and you know,

773
00:49:43.431 --> 00:49:46.250
they don't rip out.
Get your plumbing ripped out yet.

774
00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:48.950
And actually he's not right.

775
00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:53.160
Cause all my friends were drinking and stuff and I know where the fuck they want

776
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:57.590
and he thinks he speaks for all women are breastfeeding.
Yeah,

777
00:49:57.850 --> 00:50:01.790
but he knows Lee's.
What is this?
You put this in here.

778
00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:03.133
What is this?

779
00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:06.620
<v 7>While we're getting asked by my boyfriend,
sweetheart,</v>

780
00:50:06.621 --> 00:50:11.090
I don't want you to be alarmed.
Okay?
I know this may come as a shock to you,

781
00:50:11.091 --> 00:50:13.070
but I do have your best interests at heart.

782
00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:17.490
<v 0>Why did you put that in there?
Well,
I don't know.
Three pouring club.
She knew.</v>

783
00:50:17.491 --> 00:50:18.324
That's your job.

784
00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:22.810
<v 7>Now I need to make sure the doctor knows how to use his penis properly before he</v>

785
00:50:22.811 --> 00:50:26.230
can fill your perfect little holes.
Oh my interest,

786
00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:27.960
my interest dying new quick,

787
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.900
<v 0>but fucking my mother so I can talk to her.</v>

788
00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:37.640
Well,
this is crazy,
man.
Yeah,
that's a genre,
Huh?

789
00:50:37.930 --> 00:50:42.850
No,
this is a genre.
How do they label that one?
I don't know.
Mom gets me,

790
00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:46.370
my mother,
so I can talk to her.
Well,
let me guess.
A little bit of incest.

791
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.440
Incest,
anal,
but isn't the answer.
It's the Jason because he's just,

792
00:50:51.441 --> 00:50:56.090
she's not like involved.
She's just like,
dude,
stop fucking my mom.
Oh,

793
00:50:56.091 --> 00:50:59.630
so we don't know if that's her son.
I'm inferring that.
No,
no,
no.
The her son.
It's,

794
00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:04.120
it's the daughter's boyfriend I think.
Right.
So it's uh,
gosh,
I mean that's,

795
00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:08.300
it's mill is getting the boyfriend ready for her daughter.

796
00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:13.640
Oh,
okay.
I see.
Okay.
Just like the daughter has a boyfriend.
Oh yeah.

797
00:51:13.641 --> 00:51:16.240
And the mom's like,
I don't know if you know what you're doing yet.
Okay.

798
00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:18.920
I'm going to teach you mom.
You can please my daughter.

799
00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:21.920
I'm trying to think of what the,
the,
the clip title is though.

800
00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:24.860
Mom getting asked that to by my boyfriend.

801
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:29.720
Maybe mom teaches daughter's boyfriend.
How to give her daughter good anal,

802
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:32.720
something like that.
That the class too long.
It's too long.
But yeah,

803
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:34.363
you're on the right.

804
00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:38.900
I should have been a writer for all these porn.

805
00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:42.440
You would have a Donny guide,
new quit,

806
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:45.590
but be my mother so I can talk to her.
But fucking yeah,

807
00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:48.680
but fucking is a good word.
I like about a couple of words together.
Yeah,

808
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:52.250
but fucking are you guys but fucking or whatever.
Yeah,

809
00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:55.340

Yeah.

<v 0>Did you know in India they're trying to pass a law that you can't poop in public</v>

820
00:52:30.501 --> 00:52:34.910
anymore?
Is it a big problem there?
Yes.
Really overpopulated.

821
00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:37.130
Yes.
People Shit and piss everywhere.

822
00:52:37.131 --> 00:52:40.610
Some people are upset because they want to be one of those people to shit in the

823
00:52:40.611 --> 00:52:42.170
street.
Oh No.
I'd be one of the people.
They'd be like,

824
00:52:42.171 --> 00:52:46.850
can everyone stop doing this please?
It's really bothering me.
Yeah,

825
00:52:46.851 --> 00:52:47.810
me too.
Yeah.

826
00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:51.710
But some people are upset because they don't want their right to shit in public.

827
00:52:51.711 --> 00:52:56.150
Taken away.
Well,
I get it.
I mean,
there's probably is not enough toilets.
No,

828
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:59.390
there's more than a billion people there.
So many people.

829
00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:04.370
But anything that's the problem.
There's not enough toilets.
I don't know.
Well,

830
00:53:04.371 --> 00:53:08.750
kind of access to toilets.
Yeah.
Perhaps.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.

831
00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:11.100
There's a lot of people did a lot of it.
I mean,

832
00:53:11.101 --> 00:53:14.720
of course the real problem is just the most horrific poverty.

833
00:53:14.721 --> 00:53:19.540
You can imagine that too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a problem.
Well,
okay.
Uh,

834
00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:25.070
would you rather live in India for one year?

835
00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:26.200
<v 9>Okay.</v>

836
00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:30.100
<v 0>Or live as a Dalmatian amongst our dogs for one year ago.</v>

837
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.390
Now when you live in India,
by the way,
here's the thing.
You're not,
you're,

838
00:53:34.391 --> 00:53:39.190
you're living in like the level that most Indians live in.
Like the majority,

839
00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:42.910
I'm assuming that's not very good.
I mean,
what level is that in the,

840
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:46.300
you're not the 1% put it that way.
You're working class.

841
00:53:46.301 --> 00:53:50.260
You pull a fucking wreck Shah or what's not working class?
What's that?

842
00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:53.810
That's lower class.
Okay,
so,
so you're,
you're,
you're pulling a,

843
00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:55.990
you're driving that took,
took her wherever.
Fuck.

844
00:53:55.991 --> 00:53:59.260
What do they have there in India?
God,
could this be any more disrespectful?

845
00:53:59.261 --> 00:54:02.860
What did they do?
What do you mean?
What are they doing?
The fucking,
the cabs.

846
00:54:02.861 --> 00:54:06.670
What are they called?
Their cabs?
Nah,
they're not called calves.
I don't know.

847
00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:10.040
You know what I'm saying?
You,
you pull a rickshaw essentially.
Here.

848
00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:12.250
Let's look it up.
I saw it in that movie.

849
00:54:12.310 --> 00:54:16.020
The marigold hotel at the took tuck is what they are.
I don't know.

850
00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:21.680
Hey,
you're that guy or you're a fucking Dalmatian.
Look,

851
00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:25.400
here's what I looked up.
Tuck,
tuck.
I looked up taxis in India.

852
00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:31.110
Regular fucking,
but that's not what I want you to do.

853
00:54:31.111 --> 00:54:35.430
I want you to the one that you pedal,
that's a different story.

854
00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:40.600
How do you,
right,
let me see.
Paddlers.
Right pedal.
Yeah.
PDA,

855
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:45.710
right.
Pedal,
pedal,
pedal.
Or is it p e t a.
L something like,

856
00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:52.170
yeah,
I want you to,
okay.
Yeah.

857
00:54:52.171 --> 00:54:54.960
Like one of those things like a cart and you pull the,

858
00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:56.910
you pull the person in the cart.
All right.

859
00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:00.750
Or you're a Dalmatian and our house huddler an India

860
00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:04.640
hundred percent.
Not even a doubt in my mind.

861
00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:10.900
It'd be great to do that type of work.
It'd be humbling.
I would um,

862
00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:16.080
make new friends
finally stopped doing comedy.
Yeah.
Alison took,

863
00:55:16.090 --> 00:55:20.710
took,
which is known as Auto Rick Shot in India.
Okay.
Uh,

864
00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:26.510
yeah.
Tuck Tux.
So you got to buy her tuck talk.

865
00:55:26.511 --> 00:55:31.400
How much does it cost?
I'm looking it up right now.
Oh,
it's all right.
It's a lot.

866
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:34.180
It's about $2,900 to buy one of those took Tux.

867
00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:36.920
But I'll give you that money or start your business.
Yeah.
There you go.

868
00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:41.840
There you go.
You got to drive that fucking thing around.
I'll do that one year.

869
00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:45.680
One year in India.
But you've,
you've seen how they drive in India.
It's crazy.

870
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:48.500
It's really dangerous dude.
And they just run over people.

871
00:55:48.501 --> 00:55:52.430
They don't give a shit dead bodies everywhere.
Everywhere and everywhere.

872
00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:57.830
He had to stop for the cows.
I would do it.
Stupid tourists and stuff.
I'm into it.

873
00:55:58.030 --> 00:56:01.790
You have to live in that class.
Do you think this is true?

874
00:56:01.791 --> 00:56:04.520
This is real right here.
What would you do by the way?

875
00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:07.430
Don't make you lose a fucking Dalmatian.
Dude,
he is terrible.

876
00:56:07.431 --> 00:56:11.110
My stepdad would talk about how horrible it was all the time.
Come on.

877
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:14.300
You would live in like a tiny box.
First of all,

878
00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:19.430
you would live in squalor.
You sound so naive.
No,
I'm telling him.

879
00:56:19.431 --> 00:56:22.190
My stepdad used to fucking tell me why do you think he left that country?

880
00:56:22.191 --> 00:56:26.030
Do you and he didn't like it?
I think it'd be all right.
Let me come on.

881
00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:28.900
People go there all the time.
We get diarrhea like that.
That's another thing.

882
00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:32.440
I get diarrhea every day.
That's true.
You don't like Indian food?

883
00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:33.700
I love Indian food.

884
00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:36.700
You've never even with me once in the time we've been together,
you are.

885
00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:40.570
Your memory is really of concern.
I want you to know,

886
00:56:40.571 --> 00:56:44.830
I want you to go see a neurologist.
I'm serious.
I really rarely have mom brain.

887
00:56:44.831 --> 00:56:49.570
You know this?
No,
no,
no.
Over that excuse.
When's the last time we ended?

888
00:56:49.571 --> 00:56:52.610
Somebody by the way messaged me that remember I was at,

889
00:56:52.611 --> 00:56:57.500
we're playing that clip and I go on the last episode come.
Yes.

890
00:56:57.550 --> 00:57:00.820
And they're like,
dude,
you guys played it five months ago and Christina was like,

891
00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:04.150
wow,
no,
we've definitely never played that.
I'm just,

892
00:57:04.151 --> 00:57:07.090
I'm going out of their concerns.
Wait,
wait.
Okay.
But wait,
seriously,

893
00:57:07.091 --> 00:57:10.060
when's the last time we had,
I'll tell you what,
I'll tell you together.

894
00:57:10.061 --> 00:57:10.511
I don't know,

895
00:57:10.511 --> 00:57:15.340
but I do know that I have multiple memories of suggesting Indian Food and you

896
00:57:15.341 --> 00:57:17.170
shutting it down and being like,
we're going to get diarrhea.

897
00:57:17.171 --> 00:57:20.350
We are going to get diarrhea.
You,
especially when we lived on the east side,

898
00:57:20.590 --> 00:57:23.080
every time I would suggest Indian food,
you would always be like,

899
00:57:23.081 --> 00:57:25.270
we're going to get sick,
read diary.
I don't want to do that.

900
00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:29.890
And you had bad memories of going to one and there was a rat at one or
something.

901
00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:30.701
Yeah,

902
00:57:30.701 --> 00:57:34.360
well my Stepdad used to drag us all these fucking dirty Indian places growing up

903
00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:38.260
I just didn't like,
cause I,
I,
I had enough.
You know what I mean?
I'm not,

904
00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:40.090
I'm going to have smell like fucking staff are.

905
00:57:40.091 --> 00:57:42.850
I'm just saying I liked their food 14 years.
Okay.

906
00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:46.090
At was already in today.
Okay.
I'm in.

907
00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:49.920
I like that Tandoori chicken I'm in.
I'm totally a no,

908
00:57:49.930 --> 00:57:53.020
cause I worked at the electric Lotus in most fields.

909
00:57:53.021 --> 00:57:57.270
I worked at an Indian restaurant and that shit was nasty as hell.
Okay,
so see,

910
00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:58.570
I wasn't in that off.

911
00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:02.860
You didn't like it do to keep the mango Chutney and like,
uh,

912
00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:07.090
just a been filthy band.
Everyone put their fucking hands in it.
In their defense.

913
00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:12.100
A lot of different genres of food have shitty restaurants.
They all do.
Everybody.

914
00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:14.170
No Americans discussed.
Why don't we,

915
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:18.610
why don't we look up a good Indian food area?
I like to do that and I,
yeah,

916
00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:20.353
<v 6>no,</v>

917
00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:22.840
<v 10>no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.</v>

918
00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:32.300
<v 0>Do Rob,
Rob,
rob,
do you think this is real</v>

919
00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:38.870
<v 11>funny,
funny?
How</v>

920
00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:44.810
come?
Nothing.
What do you mean nothing?

921
00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:47.250
I found something now

922
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:51.410
<v 0>that's not real.
It's bad acting,
right?
Yeah.
That's,
I sent that in.</v>

923
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:55.010
We played this already.
No,
we played it without playing it on the show.

924
00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:58.640
Played it two weeks.
How's our memories work?
Oh my God.

925
00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:01.910
Someone was that the memory champion.
Look,
you will.

926
00:59:01.911 --> 00:59:04.310
You would concede that point man.
Not The memory champion.

927
00:59:04.311 --> 00:59:07.850
You want to know why I'm growing a human life inside of me.

928
00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:12.360
That takes up a lot of my resources be I take care of it.

929
00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:16.400
Fucking two year olds.
I'm responsible for a lot of his life as you are as well.

930
00:59:16.790 --> 00:59:20.660
Two dogs,
a husband myself.
It's a lot.

931
00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:23.810
A lot plates to juggle career Pi Casting,

932
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:29.270
Netflix watching.
I don't have a real estate in here anymore.

933
00:59:29.810 --> 00:59:34.040
Can you read that email?
Miss gendered cat.
Ms gendering cat.

934
00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:35.300
Hey dog cons.

935
00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:39.710
Just recently a friend of mine got a kitten from a coworker and it was informed

936
00:59:39.711 --> 00:59:40.910
by her that it was female.

937
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:45.980
Apparently she's retarded because upon further inspection it was discovered that

938
00:59:45.981 --> 00:59:47.960
the kitten is actually a male.

939
00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:52.340
You Mommy's know as well as I do that biological sex is a myth and gender is a

940
00:59:52.341 --> 00:59:54.410
spectrum,
so this is okay.

941
00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:59.210
Despite the fact that the Zimmers or feeling in question is called smokey,

942
00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:00.530
which is gender neutral.

943
01:00:00.531 --> 01:00:04.010
We still have a problem because we were under the impression this kitten is

944
01:00:04.011 --> 01:00:07.040
female.
We had been mis-gendering at the whole time.

945
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:12.320
Have we unknowingly created permanent trauma in zooms short life?

946
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:15.470
Is there a chance to,
can actually identifies as female,

947
01:00:15.471 --> 01:00:16.970
therefore making us correct.

948
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:20.480
Are we driving the kid to suicide with our Trans Phobia?

949
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:24.710
The consequences of our bigotry are endless.
Even worse,

950
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:28.670
there is the possibility that the kit and identifies with its male biology,

951
01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:30.710
which would make it a privilege,

952
01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:35.420
cisgendered male piece of shit that we would probably have to bring to the vet

953
01:00:35.421 --> 01:00:37.130
to be put down.
Anyway,

954
01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:41.900
I've got to go get fucked by a couple of hot black guys who just got out of

955
01:00:41.901 --> 01:00:45.530
prison.
Thanks for all you do mommies and congratulation on baby jeans.

956
01:00:45.531 --> 01:00:49.700
Two Point Oh which I hope you give a nonbinary name.
Beat me,
piss on me.

957
01:00:49.701 --> 01:00:52.890
Tried out Adam from Maine.
Wow.
What,

958
01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:56.350
what a [inaudible] very well written email it

959
01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.840
and I think um,

960
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:02.990
I think you guys really did make a huge mistake.

961
01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:06.200
Everyone involved at this point?

962
01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:10.290
I would say I would let that cat just into the wilderness.
Well,

963
01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:12.560
is the cast so traumatized worth,

964
01:01:12.561 --> 01:01:14.900
I mean there's a certain point like you can't help someone,

965
01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:18.900
you can't help something.
I mean,
as a therapist you could take the cat to,

966
01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:23.910
there are animal therapists and professional cuddlers and those that can speak

967
01:01:25.851 --> 01:01:29.510
to animals on the level that most of us can't.
Um,

968
01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:34.130
what does it,
what does the animal to called a psychic?

969
01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:37.610
I can animal sidekick and they could probably communicate with this.

970
01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:40.910
I'm sure if they do communicate,
they're going to say things like,

971
01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:44.870
I didn't think it was funny and I want wanna I want to move,

972
01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:48.800
I want to get the hell out of Maine and get over to the Vermont where it's more

973
01:01:48.801 --> 01:01:52.280
my speed.
Wow.
More my type and smokey,

974
01:01:52.281 --> 01:01:56.860
isn't that a racial slur as well?
So not only have we,
uh,

975
01:01:56.870 --> 01:02:01.760
mis-gendered this poor cat,
uh,
we've also given it a racist name.

976
01:02:01.761 --> 01:02:05.690
So hello.
Racial problems and gender problems.

977
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:10.670
So this is,
um,
this is a very problematic cal.
I think,

978
01:02:10.671 --> 01:02:12.800
you know what I would do maybe at this point,

979
01:02:12.801 --> 01:02:16.240
first of all is I would 100% um,

980
01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:20.130
I would assume that the cat liked being

981
01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:24.570
<v 5>addressed as a female and I would go back to treating it like a female high,</v>

982
01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:27.780
but its genitalia is male.
Yeah.

983
01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:33.020
Because it was obviously the cat knew that it wanted to be a female and that's

984
01:02:36.721 --> 01:02:38.610
why the original owner was like,

985
01:02:38.611 --> 01:02:41.640
it's a female that that owner probably know something about that cat.

986
01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:46.590
So by you treating it as a male,
you're being super disrespectful.

987
01:02:46.591 --> 01:02:49.050
It probably to the cats wishes.
Sure.

988
01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:54.020
<v 0>I Dunno.
I mean the good news is is that Smokey's kind of a gender neutral name,</v>

989
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:59.510
so they may have salvaged it's gender crisis shut her identity crisis.

990
01:03:01.030 --> 01:03:02.030
Well,
and by the way,

991
01:03:02.031 --> 01:03:05.900
cats don't share the same gender orientations that humans do.

992
01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:09.560
There's a whole different spectrum,
I'm sure if cat gender,
so aren't there.

993
01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:10.950
I think the,

994
01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:15.030
<v 5>what's obvious is that all though this cat has male genitalia,</v>

995
01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:18.990
it's a female at heart.
So I think you should,
you should be treating it as such.

996
01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:22.410
Okay.
I think you're assuming it's true.
I think you're assuming it's Pronoun.

997
01:03:23.490 --> 01:03:27.960
The swallowing come make me a cannibal.
Hmm hmm.

998
01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:29.790
As they come kind of sore.

999
01:03:29.791 --> 01:03:33.330
I woke up this morning smelling like dicks and I was wondering is there a

1000
01:03:33.331 --> 01:03:37.470
millions of potential of humans in sperm when you swallow all that come,

1001
01:03:37.471 --> 01:03:41.850
does that make you a cannibal?
Hmm.
Uh,
certainly messes my chances of being Vegan.

1002
01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:45.810
I'm sure asking Mommy's gives me the best chance of getting a well analyzed

1003
01:03:45.811 --> 01:03:50.550
answer to my question.
In Jesus's name,
Lisa,
the ball hog.
Wow.
Lisa.

1004
01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:54.000
It like a yo angel.
Um,
what do you think gene?

1005
01:03:54.090 --> 01:03:58.770
<v 0>Well,
human life doesn't start a sperm,</v>

1006
01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:01.620
uh,
without egg.
So I,
you know,

1007
01:04:01.621 --> 01:04:05.250
cause all those right to life or folks don't get upset when you just spill Jizz

1008
01:04:05.251 --> 01:04:09.210
on fee convict shine.
They get upset when you kill a baby,
a person.

1009
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:12.300
So I don't think it's cannibalism per say.

1010
01:04:12.301 --> 01:04:16.770
It's maybe partial cannibalism to eat it.
It's not,

1011
01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.990
it's not yet a human is what I'm trying to get out.

1012
01:04:19.090 --> 01:04:22.450
<v 5>But it is an a product created from another animal.</v>

1013
01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:26.500
You know,
the only,
the only loophole in this,

1014
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:29.840
<v 0>and when she's not asking us,
she vegan,
she's asking,
is it cannibalism?</v>

1015
01:04:29.841 --> 01:04:33.730
Cannibalism implies eating another human.
Right,
right.
Mm.
Yeah.

1016
01:04:33.830 --> 01:04:38.030
It's not a human yet.
It's just a spur.
It's part of a human part of a human.

1017
01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:42.440
Right.
But I mean,
she's on her way.
Oh No.
Oh,
I want to say no,

1018
01:04:42.441 --> 01:04:45.590
I think you're safe.
You can,
you can drink as much as,
as you want.

1019
01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:49.040
I'd say don't worry about it.
Wow.
Keep drinking all of that.

1020
01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.960
<v 5>Um,
I'm uh,
I'm not,</v>

1021
01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:56.760
I'm not on board with Christina on this one for sure,
but seriously.
Yeah,

1022
01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:00.720
I don't think so.
Well,
what are you trying to say?
That it is cannibalism?

1023
01:05:01.110 --> 01:05:05.040
I think you're pretty much on your way.
I think it's,
I think it's,
um,

1024
01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:07.440
I think it's something you'd,
if I,
if I were you,

1025
01:05:07.441 --> 01:05:11.940
I would throw in the towel on that and try to try to,
um,

1026
01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:16.440
try to make it right with your life right now.
Okay.

1027
01:05:16.441 --> 01:05:18.580
I know we do need to think of some non-binary

1028
01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:22.180
<v 0>names for our future son.
You mean son</v>

1029
01:05:23.890 --> 01:05:28.150
idiot
for a future.
Sims are,

1030
01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:33.580
what are some good non a gender neutral names?
Casey?

1031
01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:35.140
Casey's a good one.

1032
01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:37.743
<v 9>Uh,</v>

1033
01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:42.690
<v 0>Pat,
obviously Chris.
Chris goes both ways.
Very neutral.</v>

1034
01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:49.020
We have to think of a,
a lot of these diamond.
Yeah.

1035
01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:53.820
They've diamonds pretty female?
I don't think so.
I don't think so.

1036
01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:59.450
I know a lot of cool guys named Diamond Shit.

1037
01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:04.680
Speaking of ges and all that,
this is interesting.

1038
01:06:04.681 --> 01:06:09.060
We featured this guy a few weeks ago and he has a new,

1039
01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:12.820
a bit of information.
He wanted to share it and for him,
no.

1040
01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:14.961
You know what I'm saying?

1041
01:06:14.961 --> 01:06:19.220
Like the other day when I get a hug from my chick of,

1042
01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:24.230
of or afterwards I'm born free came and my pants literally pre came and my pants

1043
01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:29.630
a couple of minutes after that.
Boehner and then it went away.

1044
01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:34.820
Okay.
So that's why he knows he's straight.
Oh,
okay.

1045
01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:38.570
I tend to think if you haven't had sex in a long ass fucking time,
oh,

1046
01:06:38.571 --> 01:06:43.010
what the f is some female just gives you a hug and it gives you a boner and then

1047
01:06:43.011 --> 01:06:47.210
you pre come your pants afterwards.
I tend to think that you're straight.

1048
01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:49.483
<v 9>I Dunno.</v>

1049
01:06:50.790 --> 01:06:55.500
<v 0>I didn't know that,
that it was that
big of a deal.
I think he's,</v>

1050
01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:58.530
it's almost like he's trying to prove that he's straight.

1051
01:06:58.630 --> 01:07:01.540
He's probably getting a lot of comments like you,
you look like a fat.

1052
01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:05.230
That's what I was going to say.
Yeah.
Well Golf guys get a lot of that stuff.

1053
01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:07.060
You're gay.
Yeah.
Usually your home,

1054
01:07:07.061 --> 01:07:12.061
all your stupid hair and your stupid black things and your dog collar and he's

1055
01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:17.550
proving that he's not by telling you that he almost came in his pants just by

1056
01:07:17.771 --> 01:07:19.720
getting a hug from come hug.
Yeah.
This guy,

1057
01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:22.780
he's trying to say he invented the combine.
He's saying he's the come hugger.

1058
01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:27.220
Yeah.
I do like his theory about inhaling the fart though.

1059
01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:32.350
Yeah.
That's the same guy who said that if you,
uh,

1060
01:07:32.650 --> 01:07:36.400
if he fars at work,
he tries to snip it off so nobody else can smell it.

1061
01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:39.400
And I swear I've had the same exact thought too.
I can't,

1062
01:07:39.401 --> 01:07:42.220
I can't lie and say that a habit that you can sniff it all up.
Yeah.

1063
01:07:42.221 --> 01:07:43.810
Like if I inhale deeply right now,

1064
01:07:43.811 --> 01:07:46.330
maybe I can save it like the other people won't smell it.

1065
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:49.420
I've had the exact same stupid thought.
Well then I go,
oh,
that's stupid.

1066
01:07:49.421 --> 01:07:53.450
That's not possible.
Yeah.
I have come all over my face,
nerve Karma,

1067
01:07:55.650 --> 01:08:00.280
aunts and dad shoes on.
Oh,
tell me about it.
I'll show you.

1068
01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:02.630
You got these for me.
Can you guys say that?

1069
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:06.060
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1070
01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:10.060
<v 0>Can you see those?
Yeah,
there's so daddy shoes.</v>

1071
01:08:10.570 --> 01:08:14.890
They're like,
they're a d dos,
but they don't,
I mean,

1072
01:08:14.891 --> 01:08:19.550
I don't look sexy.
I feel like I look like a total dad boner,
but they're so good.

1073
01:08:19.551 --> 01:08:23.840
It's like walking on boats.
Yeah.
They feel really nice and they're slip on,

1074
01:08:23.841 --> 01:08:27.890
which I'm a huge fan of their,
their fantastic right now.
Really Nice.

1075
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:32.810
By the way,
I want,
I wanted to mention this before.
Oh yeah.
This is an honor of,

1076
01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:36.000
of you really.
I mean,
no boy,
no,
no,
no,
no.
This is good for,

1077
01:08:36.010 --> 01:08:39.080
it's never positive on her.
You know,
this is good.

1078
01:08:40.730 --> 01:08:41.563
We're going to like it.
Yeah.

1079
01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:46.140
<v 5>Okay.
Uh,
this guy,
yeah.
He,
he wrote in,</v>

1080
01:08:46.150 --> 01:08:50.440
Christina made me realize current map of the United States is inaccurate.

1081
01:08:51.070 --> 01:08:56.070
And so he worked on this and we liked it so much that we decided we're going to

1082
01:08:57.191 --> 01:08:57.830
do it.
We're going to

1083
01:08:57.830 --> 01:09:00.800
<v 0>put it in our store.
Oh,
this,
I love this.
Yeah,
you're right.</v>

1084
01:09:00.830 --> 01:09:05.560
This is my favorite store now.
It is a map of the United States.

1085
01:09:06.130 --> 01:09:07.860
Yeah,
I'm sure it has a,

1086
01:09:07.861 --> 01:09:11.780
it says not Los Angeles everywhere.

1087
01:09:11.810 --> 01:09:15.170
And then Los Angeles.
We're in Los Angeles.
This looks right to me.

1088
01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.470
This is how I see America.
I love the shirt though.
It is great.

1089
01:09:18.471 --> 01:09:19.730
If you want to rep la

1090
01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:24.360
<v 5>cool shirt.
Uh,
he wrote my c Cups,
let girlfriend,</v>

1091
01:09:24.361 --> 01:09:28.030
her brother and I all went to des Moines.
Um,
