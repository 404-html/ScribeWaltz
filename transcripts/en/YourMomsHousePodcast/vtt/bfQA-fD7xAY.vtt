91
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.060
It's fantastic.
I masturbated.
Yeah.
I didn't even know you were in the room.

92
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.460
That's I know how weird and apropos of the show.
Yeah.

93
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.500
Well cause we were took a shower together and I was Todd's in your kibbles and

94
00:08:24.501 --> 00:08:26.660
bits and I,
and I was like,

95
00:08:26.661 --> 00:08:30.350
I don't know if we have time to really get one in or whatnot even suggest that.

96
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.270
But I was thinking it in my head.
I go,
I,

97
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.550
I don't know if you have touch right again,

98
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.290
you did participate in the shower and you're like,
I gotta go in the shower.
Ooh,

99
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:42.220
really fucks in the shower.
I mean now I can't,
I'm on,

100
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.600
my bones are all out of whack now.
Okay.
Anyways,

101
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.500
I wasn't sure what the little bass,
hello.
And now I'm talking again,

102
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.730
but you see what I'm trying to do.

103
00:08:49.731 --> 00:08:51.860
I'm just trying to set it up and it starts playing.

104
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.510
I'm just trying to like place it.

105
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.910
I wasn't sure my blue band would come over and I didn't know if we had time

106
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.270
there.
That's the story.
Then you got out of the shower and I saw you in the bed.

107
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:00.451
Well,

108
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:04.530
I saw you go into the closet and then I saw you come out and then I was like,
oh,

109
00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:06.660
at first,
actually I didn't know if you were in the closet or not.

110
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:09.210
And then I was like,
oh,
she's not in there.
I didn't hear any noise.
So I was like,

111
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.080
oh,
there's no one in the room.
I'll crank one out.
Yeah.

112
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:16.980
And then I did and uh,
uh,

113
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.440
stuff happened and you know,
and then I was like,
no.

114
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.740
And I was like,
do you want to do it now?
Let's do it.
We got a few minutes.

115
00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:27.800
Then what happened?
Then you go,
you can,

116
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.320
they blew my note and then I say it like that.

117
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.490
I already did it,
eh,

118
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:39.890
he got us Stip Dick Right after I tried to have marital Catholic love with you

119
00:09:42.031 --> 00:09:45.570
and you spilled your seed carelessly in the shower.
Yup,
that's true.

120
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.480
You know what I was thinking to myself,
I was like,
dude,

121
00:09:48.481 --> 00:09:52.620
he's taken a really long shower and it's not like you,
you usually,
first of all,

122
00:09:52.621 --> 00:09:56.010
you don't really clean anything.
Like you got to blow your nose,

123
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.830
you shake around like a dog and then you get out.

124
00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.440
I was just trying to make sure I was,
I was actually extra quiet.

125
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:02.303
I should have been more.

126
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.040
<v 5>Oh my God,</v>

127
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:16.630
<v 3>I should have done that.
Oh Man.
But I was,
I was actually like,
oh what a show.</v>

128
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.010
Cause I thought you might've been walking around.
Yeah.

129
00:10:19.011 --> 00:10:22.430
And then that didn't deter you whatsoever.
Where I turned myself away from the,

130
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:26.960
it's a very,
it's not the ideal bathroom for masturbating.
No.

131
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:28.190
Pleasantly No.

132
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.580
Cause there's no door between the bedroom and the showers and especially once

133
00:10:31.581 --> 00:10:35.150
Ellis starts walking.
I'm sure he's going to want to see you.
We've got time.
Okay.

134
00:10:35.151 --> 00:10:38.840
You can walk it in on your dad cranky when it,
is there anything more scarring?

135
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.880
Your Dad wants to remain a master?
Nope.

136
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:47.330
What that might be.
The only thing I haven't seen.

137
00:10:47.331 --> 00:10:51.050
Then your parents used to like not really be big on clothes though when you're

138
00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:54.800
really young.
Yeah,
we'll we're European.
Yeah.
It was naked all the time.

139
00:10:54.801 --> 00:10:59.660
Everybody was nude and no weird.
No.
I saw my mom naked all the time.

140
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.870
And Your Dad all the time?
My dad naked all the time.

141
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:07.790
I had a friend come over when I was like 11 and she was like,
your dad's naked.

142
00:11:07.791 --> 00:11:11.800
And I'm like,
Oh yeah,
daddy could put on something.
There's a friend.
He's like,
oh,

143
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:15.690
okay.
Why?
No.
I think he first went,
why?
I'm like,
why?

144
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.600
Where would he be naked and the backyard.

145
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:21.890
We lived in Canoga Park in the backyard and he liked to sunbathe nude.

146
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.320
That was what he was doing is just always naked in the back yard.

147
00:11:24.321 --> 00:11:25.670
I should preface it by saying,

148
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.470
and whoever was over whatever girlfriend there naked in the backyard,

149
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.580
just sunbathing.
It was very natural.

150
00:11:31.581 --> 00:11:35.210
And that doesn't strike you now as really bizarre though.
No.
Because?

151
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.470
Because when you grow up with naked parents,
no,
no,
but now you have perspective.

152
00:11:39.471 --> 00:11:43.370
So No.
If Ella saw me nude,
if I don't think I'd give a shit,

153
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.130
I still don't think so.
I don't care what it's not sexual.

154
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.760
There were European babe and your pants are just naked.

155
00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:56.590
Only Americans are uptight about nudity.
No,
I can't.

156
00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:59.620
If you're a European right in and let us know that it's normal,

157
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:01.810
that everybody's naked,
they're not going to tell you it's normal.

158
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.800
What about my dad drinking a 12 or every night?

159
00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:10.650
I think it's normal for a man to be nude around 10 and 11 year olds and then,

160
00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:13.260
and then you go put on some clothes and he was like,
why?
Right.

161
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.600
Well then that's the thing is that I had to tell my dad that that wasn't

162
00:12:16.601 --> 00:12:18.970
appropriate.
And America,
that you can't just be naked.

163
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:22.000
Why it appropriate anywhere else though?
I don't think it is.

164
00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:27.140
I don't think a Hungarian thing.
I don't know.
So,

165
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:32.170
but then he started putting on like [inaudible] people were over and then

166
00:12:32.171 --> 00:12:34.750
eventually I became a teenager and then he covered up.
Yeah.

167
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.250
But when I became a teenager,
he stopped.

168
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:42.440
But you're 10 and 11 nude walking around the house nude.

169
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:46.360
Yeah,
yes.
Everybody in my family.
Yes.

170
00:12:46.361 --> 00:12:51.130
My mother was naked all the time,
tops and bottoms,
tops and bottoms.

171
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.690
I'd see my mom been really close her vagina like a ton of times.
All the time.

172
00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:00.800
Yeah.
It's just normal.
It was normal baby.
My mom had big soggy hangers.

173
00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.190
Topless.
You said naked?
Yes.

174
00:13:03.191 --> 00:13:07.090
She come out of the shower and she would be talking to me like we get ready for,

175
00:13:07.091 --> 00:13:07.330
oh,

176
00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.330
and then my mom would like run through the house and go to the kitchen naked to

177
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:11.800
grab something as she was coming out of the truck.

178
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.480
It wasn't like we were new this,

179
00:13:13.481 --> 00:13:16.480
but if somebody took a shower and then like had to grab something,

180
00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:18.850
another part of the house.
So just crawl,
you know,
walked around.

181
00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:24.810
Well you never saw anybody charro top dog soon to masturbate.

182
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.713
Of course.

183
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:30.890
That's like a very common bonding thing for most for most fathers and sons.

184
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.890
America.
No,
I'm serious.

185
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.600
But you've seen your dad's nuts and and dick.
Yeah,
but not a lot.

186
00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:42.520
And not on it,
like on accident,
like walking in and change everything out,

187
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.410
but not,
not with any regularity.
Oh yeah.

188
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.250
People just walk around.
It wasn't,
it wasn't like a lifestyle.

189
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.890
Actually have another person in the room did tie normal.

190
00:13:56.891 --> 00:13:58.680
He crept normal.
Well,
yeah,
we're trying to do,

191
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.390
we're trying to establish what's normal.
Right?
American.
Both Israeli parents,

192
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.660
Shit.
Israelis are nudists aren't they?
Kind of,
nope.

193
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:12.350
So I'm learning that my childhood was way fucked up.
I didn't realize it.

194
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.330
I'm 40 years old.
What do you,
what's your vote?

195
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:20.820
I mean,
I've seen,
well,

196
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:24.160
I'm not watching on my dad.
How about the idea of nudity?

197
00:14:24.161 --> 00:14:28.840
Just kind of being walking around.
That's weird.
That's weird.
Jews are funny.

198
00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:34.040
Well,
I don't like if Ellis walks in on me changing,
what am I supposed to?
Oh no,

199
00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:37.430
of course not.
No,
but that's different.
That's totally going to you.

200
00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:41.230
The difference is walking in on you changing and you being like,

201
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.860
I'm just laying around with what dick out Saturday friend over here.
You're 10.

202
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.830
What's up?
Like you don't think that that's,
yeah,
that's true.

203
00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:52.040
I never thought of it that way.
It was so normal.
Yeah.
It must've really been.

204
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.760
<v 6>Normally you,
there wasn't like erotic.</v>

205
00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:59.990
It didn't feel sexy or anything.
I just,
I didn't think he thought it felt sexy.

206
00:14:59.991 --> 00:15:03.800
It's my dad.
I like how you take it there.
Felt sexy.

207
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:06.720
That's wrong with you.
You're,

208
00:15:06.721 --> 00:15:09.590
my dad also taught me to shoot guns in the backyard when I was nine.

209
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:14.450
That's a normal,
yes.
Okay.
Yes,
of course.
If you're supposed to just checking.

210
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.270
Yeah.
Were you allowed to drink beer as child?

211
00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:19.260
<v 7>MMM,</v>

212
00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.880
<v 6>no,
I think but,
but probably way before certain super conservative families,</v>

213
00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.330
you know?
Yeah.
Like I had sips of stuff young.

214
00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.793
<v 7>MMM.</v>

215
00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:33.760
<v 6>But I was allowed to drink,
have a drink in the house with dinner.
Uh,</v>

216
00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.310
probably by the time I was in high school.
Yeah.
I'll see.
That's good.

217
00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:41.200
That's normal.
Yeah.
I think that's not,
not like I got like you're 11,

218
00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:42.880
right?
Here's a glass of whiskey.

219
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.430
Although that's when I was 10 when I had my first sip of whiskey,

220
00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:48.500
but it was a sip and I was like,
I think I'm gonna throw up.
Yeah.

221
00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.380
I couldn't believe people liked it.

222
00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:51.640
<v 7>Okay.</v>

223
00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.870
<v 6>All right.
So who is this guy?
Is that back home?
This is David Beckham.
And,
uh,</v>

224
00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:59.520
he's talking to the Dj Khaled about,
uh,
how long have your Dj friends?

225
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.420
I want his jewelry so badly.
You can,
you can get on camera.

226
00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:05.950
<v 4>This album an uppercut in a knockoff.</v>

227
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.650
And I always wonder when you say these things core,

228
00:16:08.651 --> 00:16:13.440
you fighting when you call this a victory.
Who did you defeat the fuck boys?

229
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.450
And that's what's he doing now?
You can answer the question.
You can eat the wing.

230
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.630
It's not the Olympics here.
Yeah.
But um,
yeah,
the fuck boys.

231
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.730
The guys that try to give us roadblocks,
those wings look good.

232
00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:29.650
Yeah.
I want language.
I know me too.
For fuckboys.

233
00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:33.010
And what makes somebody a fuck boy,
good question.
I mean,

234
00:16:33.011 --> 00:16:36.160
this is a better word for hater.
Mad people,

235
00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:42.190
bumps losers,
garbage pizza.
Shit.

236
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:44.590
I like this guy going to hire you.
Do that.

237
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:46.240
<v 6>I like that.</v>

238
00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.800
Can I tell you there's probably no worse premise for a talk show than eating as

239
00:16:50.801 --> 00:16:54.100
you're talking.
That's also the hook of it.
Not yet.

240
00:16:54.101 --> 00:16:57.500
And they eat increasingly hotter wings throughout.
Yeah.

241
00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:02.590
It's just gross to watch him.
Yeah,
I know.
And the hearing that right?
Yeah.

242
00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:05.500
It's like listening to be smalls rab.
He was always showing

243
00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.690
no,
it's true.
He's always sounded like he was eating that.

244
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:15.260
That was just the fat of his mouth.
She'll fucking fat.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But anyway,
uh,

245
00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.380
folklore,
I think that's a loose definition.

246
00:17:17.381 --> 00:17:20.320
I still think it's in reference to homosexuals.
Well,

247
00:17:20.321 --> 00:17:24.080
but it's actually encompassing.
I think it's fair to encompass everything.
Loser.

248
00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.930
Just say it more.
Are you saying it more now?

249
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:29.320
Are you in cut like in your visiting your lexicon boy.
Oh,
well,

250
00:17:29.321 --> 00:17:34.010
hopefully we can say more.
Know what?
I'm going to make a note of that.
Uh,

251
00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.410
at the comedy store,
the Saturday,

252
00:17:35.411 --> 00:17:40.411
I'm going to incorporate the word fuck a boy boy to be jet stroller.

253
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:45.430
Boy.
Yeah.
You don't want to cause a nonbinary fuckboy or is it binary?

254
00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.550
That's another great point.
That's a maybe,
uh,
maybe,

255
00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:52.480
maybe there's your bit right there.
Maybe that's the whole new bit.
What,

256
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:57.120
how should I be spelling?
Fuck boy.
Boy,
boy.

257
00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.120
Boy is the way to go.
But wait a minute.

258
00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:04.110
But boys are women that identify masculine.

259
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:08.580
That's the whole,
I would say f,
U,
C,
c,
d,
O,
y.

260
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.150
And if you cc that's what's up.
Yeah,
yeah,

261
00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:19.140
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

262
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.530
Well the fuck.

263
00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.800
That's how you should say you're so handsome.
Thanks.
I do love you.

264
00:18:28.801 --> 00:18:33.020
Some days.
Oh,
Wednesdays where she would have done it with paint today.

265
00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.170
I know.
I wanted to,
I was,

266
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.790
I was busy by myself.

267
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.760
Do you make those noises?
Sometimes.

268
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:50.310
I was real quiet though.

269
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:53.970
Thinking about Rihanna and where you like stay up off my Instagram.

270
00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.840
I was like thinking about sex with Rihanna loose.
Be Amazed.

271
00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:03.730
You mean you don't masturbate to your wife?
What?
Yeah,
I was like my wife,

272
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:07.670
my wife
or women dumb enough.
Uh,

273
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.640
that they think that can I have a cup of diarrhea please?

274
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:14.730
People have been tweeting what's in the cup?
It looks like diarrhea.
Well,

275
00:19:14.731 --> 00:19:18.100
it's dog diarrhea and it's excellent.
Liked it.

276
00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:20.010
And it was because we microwave it,

277
00:19:20.011 --> 00:19:23.100
we reheat it and then it explodes in the microwave.
That's it looks,

278
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:27.560
it looks like diarrhea.
It's not microwave.
Not this particular cup,

279
00:19:27.561 --> 00:19:32.460
but mine often is and then it looks like it's splatter diarrhea.

280
00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.580
Oh,
I got you.
I thought you meant the color complexion of it.
Oh,

281
00:19:35.581 --> 00:19:39.360
you mean sometimes he's just splattered heat.
It too much you like.

282
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:44.520
That's a weird thing about you.
Weird thing about you.
You hate hot food.

283
00:19:44.521 --> 00:19:48.510
Hate it,
and you'll microwave this shit at a coffee.
It'd be so hot.

284
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.310
Have you drink?
That's the only thing I like hot.
It's

285
00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.200
so bizarre.
I mean,

286
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.450
you're always walking around with your tits out in front of our child.

287
00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:01.970
He's going to see him.
Of course.
He'd be like,
mom,
you don't.

288
00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:04.710
He's going to see dad's Dick.
Dad's Dick.

289
00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:07.310
That's a great title for your next special.
Yup.

290
00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:11.600
Did we have come up with a good one for you?
Dad's dicks.
No.

291
00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:16.380
Remember I was right before you left the other day.
Something about my tits.
Yeah.

292
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:20.520
Slop or central or something.
Sloppers cow.
My tits are ruined.

293
00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:26.450
Not ruined.
Anyways,
what else?
When we talk about the,

294
00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:30.630
the Americans we got into that show,
Americans is great.
Oh,
wonderful.

295
00:20:30.631 --> 00:20:34.350
It's not mark and the American Americans is real good.
Um,

296
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:38.880
it's really something to find a show you can buy into that's really well done.

297
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.090
Yeah.
I'm really into highly recommend.
Obviously a lot of people have watched it.

298
00:20:42.091 --> 00:20:44.280
This is the new way I think of watching shows.

299
00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.190
It's no longer about watching a show

300
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.940
<v 0>as it airs all the time.
No,
I mean everyone's going to have the few,</v>

301
00:20:51.941 --> 00:20:55.200
they do that with.
It's what are you going to watch over time and,
and,

302
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.840
and buy into and it's gotta be,
you know,

303
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.040
really high quality because it's so competitive.
It shows her so good.
Yeah.

304
00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:07.510
Americans,
I'm word nine episodes in the first season.
Season One,

305
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:11.920
I think there's five seasons.
Yeah.
It's phenomenal.
It's,

306
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.540
and it's really good premise.

307
00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:18.570
So people understand is Russian spies that are living here,

308
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:25.450
uh,
in deep under deep cover during the 80s,
during the height of the Cold War.

309
00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:29.680
And they are basically trying to,

310
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:32.950
they're giving the image that they are Americans,
right?

311
00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:37.900
While they're acting for the KGB.
Yeah.
And it's men.

312
00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:42.280
But the thing is that alone is a good premise.
So well layered.

313
00:21:42.281 --> 00:21:44.230
The show is,
you know,
with,
with,

314
00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:48.080
<v 3>well,
cause they're supposed to be married partners.
KGB,
yes.</v>

315
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:50.150
Partners and not be romantically linked,

316
00:21:50.151 --> 00:21:53.770
but they'd been going for so long and they have two kids.
So the story is like,

317
00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.640
do we become romantically involved?

318
00:21:55.641 --> 00:22:00.590
Do we trust each other and then back and forth.
Then Fbi,
FBI,

319
00:22:00.591 --> 00:22:03.080
her storyline is so neat,
man.
I don't want to get back.

320
00:22:03.081 --> 00:22:07.220
Some of it I think historical,
I'm sorry.
Doggies historically accurate.

321
00:22:07.221 --> 00:22:12.070
Some of it is dead drops and all that cool stuff.
I love that.
KGB crap.

322
00:22:12.071 --> 00:22:15.710
I when I visited the Berlin Wall and they have um,
uh,
you know,

323
00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:20.390
museums purchase no checkpoint Charlie.
And you can see how people snuck in,

324
00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:23.760
but when you went there,
you went,
it's in Berlin.
Yeah.

325
00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.900
Where people are wearing clothes or I know the Europeans,
they were they naked

326
00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:32.810
chicks and Ted said Berlin.
No West.
Yes.
Mostly nude.

327
00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.710
Mostly nude or European?
Yeah.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

328
00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.670
Well you ever been to like a European bathhouse?
They're all naked.
I've know.

329
00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:41.870
I've been to Europe,

330
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.300
but you never went to a bad house where people go and they just sit around with

331
00:22:45.301 --> 00:22:48.890
your dicks out.
I went to a semester of school and muddied.

332
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:53.240
What about topless beach?
Most of Europe you can be topless.

333
00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.420
It's not a big deal.
Tits out.
New to these.
A little more

334
00:22:56.510 --> 00:23:00.080
<v 0>forgiving.
Yes.
The NF by a where I remember we watched,
uh,</v>

335
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:03.350
the house hunters international.

336
00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:08.810
I'm always blown away by it when they go like,
well,
uh,
we are,

337
00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:13.400
we're married and we have,
we live in Connecticut and we have three children.

338
00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:16.790
Yeah.
11.
Yeah.
And now they're in school.

339
00:23:16.791 --> 00:23:21.410
We always kind of wanted to experience Spain.

340
00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.990
So we're moving there and you're like,
wait,
what?

341
00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.810
And then it's like kids are going to Majorca.

342
00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:32.000
<v 3>I don't want to go to my,
uh,
I want to see my friends and the not anymore.</v>

343
00:23:32.001 --> 00:23:34.460
You don't,
I don't even speak Spanish.

344
00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:38.930
You'll learn you're young enough to pick it up.
Right.
But in five years,
right.

345
00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:42.650
So brutal.
You do matter doing anything worse to small children.

346
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:46.040
We're going to rip you out from your friends.
Your school.

347
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.920
<v 6>One kid was young enough in that family where like she doesn't know what's going</v>

348
00:23:48.921 --> 00:23:50.330
on.
The other two were like,

349
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:55.070
fuck off my York and I don't like how I'm on set our norm.
I want to go back.

350
00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:58.340
Yeah,
of course.
Of course they do.
Well then an errors are like,
they love it

351
00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:04.310
and it's like a small outskirt village too.
It's not even like,

352
00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.760
oh city.
What a nice expensive.

353
00:24:07.761 --> 00:24:11.720
That was $3 million to renovate U s 3 million.

354
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:16.100
God Damn Man.
What's the,
what's Nice there in Georgia?

355
00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:21.470
But it's expensive,
right?
Like the euro is pretty good.
They're not like Hungary.

356
00:24:21.471 --> 00:24:26.060
It's a little worse.
It was.
It was amazing amount of money they spent.

357
00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:30.680
Could you imagine and they're like,
it took a year.
No,

358
00:24:30.681 --> 00:24:32.000
it took two years to renovate.

359
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:35.270
They thought they were going to be all in their new year and there's nearly two

360
00:24:35.271 --> 00:24:39.050
years.
I have no interest in renovating anything.
I see.

361
00:24:39.051 --> 00:24:42.670
I told you do this.
I want to,
what do you want to renovate?
I would want,

362
00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.670
I would want to,

363
00:24:43.671 --> 00:24:48.671
I have a fantasy of buying a modest home and then doing the major renno.

364
00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:53.060
I thought,
yeah,
I thought it'd be fun.
Like tearing it down and starting.
Well,

365
00:24:53.061 --> 00:24:56.930
both.
I mean,
obviously there's different levels of commitment at that point.

366
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:59.480
Then money and what a nightmare.
The thing is,

367
00:24:59.481 --> 00:25:02.990
La is so crazy for a housing market that,
you know,

368
00:25:02.991 --> 00:25:07.190
you gotta do you have to do something out of the,
you know,

369
00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:12.560
can I tell you why?
No,
just imagine the chaos.
Like,
you know,
when you have movers,

370
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:17.390
remember we were packing and you had movers come in and you're packing and the

371
00:25:17.391 --> 00:25:20.570
stress of like workers.
I know,
I know every day,

372
00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.270
but I think the way to do it would be like,

373
00:25:23.271 --> 00:25:27.080
let's say it's like they did on that show you and you're in the house that

374
00:25:27.081 --> 00:25:28.880
you're renting,
right?
You'll have random place.

375
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:33.140
Then you buy the other place and you start doing the work as you live in your

376
00:25:33.141 --> 00:25:36.730
rental.
Yeah.
So huge commitment.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

377
00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:40.220
But then you end up getting into a place that you really love.
That's true.
Yeah.

378
00:25:40.221 --> 00:25:44.630
You can custom it.
Well that one day when we have millions and millions,

379
00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:50.080
that's the thing is in most parts of the country you could do that without

380
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.290
millions and millions.
I know it's a fantasy.

381
00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:57.800
Well they go there literally are like parts in here.

382
00:25:57.801 --> 00:26:02.801
We just saw online this a house that was for sale and then the ad for the house

383
00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.210
was tear this down and build a house

384
00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.850
and the house was two point $3 million.

385
00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:17.390
So they're saying spend 2.3 to not Lisbon,

386
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.030
tear this piece of shit down.
They don't even,

387
00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.080
didn't even try to sell you on live.
They're like blow this house sucks,

388
00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:29.210
but it's a great property.
Then spend your money on top of that.

389
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:33.320
See,
but if you have that kind of cash,
you're saying by something spasming,

390
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:37.400
Rad and not,
you know,
or you could make something.
I don't know.

391
00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:42.650
It all sounds like a nightmare.
I have no patience for building things.

392
00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.350
No.
You said that like your name was Pedro.
I ain't got no.

393
00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:46.393
<v 8>Okay.</v>

394
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:56.220
<v 6>Just like a black mom when you said that was really good.</v>

395
00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:00.980
There you go.
But I'll tell you,
but that should do.

396
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:06.740
So speaking of patriarch starting our patriarch June 1st June 1st just so people

397
00:27:07.591 --> 00:27:11.910
know,
nothing will change about this show come out the same way it came out.

398
00:27:11.911 --> 00:27:13.320
Different toilet,
different toilet man.

399
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:17.880
So all we're doing is extra added bonus content,

400
00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.690
added access,
more stuff at Patrion.

401
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:26.990
It launches Petrie on June 1st and we've already done our first Patriot on bonus

402
00:27:27.961 --> 00:27:28.771
episodes.

403
00:27:28.771 --> 00:27:32.340
Good till you guys are going to hear all about my brand new tennis lessons.

404
00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:37.460
It's my eastern blocky.
Oh God coach.
It's really cool.
Yeah.

405
00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.710
What else do we talk about that one to questions?
Yeah,
we did it.

406
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.590
We answering personal questions.

407
00:27:43.591 --> 00:27:47.430
We answered questions about the show that you guys emailed in.

408
00:27:47.431 --> 00:27:51.460
So if you want to know some behind the scenes stuff,
get on our patriotic,

409
00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:57.340
you make a small donation.
It's like a monthly contribution and a,

410
00:27:57.341 --> 00:28:01.170
there's going to be even things that people can get can win,
right?
Or no though.

411
00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.313
When

412
00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:08.700
you get into art or art club,
they can,

413
00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:12.090
oh the art club and you get a piece of art that I create.

414
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.220
If you haven't seen my,
what I'm capable of.
If you go on my Instagram,

415
00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:21.000
you can see one of my original works.
Um,
so there'll be stuff like that.

416
00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:24.630
It's going to be great.
We're excited about it.
Hey,
by the way,
you know,
um,

417
00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:30.680
you're well known for your art teacher jacket and somebody actually found that

418
00:28:31.561 --> 00:28:36.400
if you keep that jacket on long enough,
how,
where you're like,

419
00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:37.450
what you're going to,

420
00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:42.450
<v 8>you were doing in the future devoted to the rainbow spine.</v>

421
00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:47.580
Oh my God,
I'm so excited.
Arts and crafts department sent me to Korea now,

422
00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:51.380
not a normal sponge.
This is so dense and love her.

423
00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:56.390
Resizes because I can't stand just one size and I talk about

424
00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.660
the hygiene of sponge.

425
00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.530
I squeezed and squeezed and squeezed and squeezed.

426
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:09.520
No flab on this arm.
My cleaning Flav on this arm.
Now if you do,

427
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:13.320
I love her so much.
Of course you love her.
I want to be her.

428
00:29:13.321 --> 00:29:16.620
I want to be happy like you asked for.
How do you get that happy?

429
00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:20.890
<v 6>You wear that jacket longer.
Wear your jacket,
your art teacher jacket.</v>

430
00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:22.480
I want her to be my mom.

431
00:29:22.481 --> 00:29:26.860
Why can't my mom be nice like that lady that's all stoked about sponges and

432
00:29:26.861 --> 00:29:27.790
colors and shit.

433
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.760
<v 8>You asked for it a whole
look at the</v>

434
00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:41.740
earth tone.
Look at death.

435
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.560
Is this fun?
She's a great,
yeah,

436
00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:51.850
<v 3>I love her.
How does she get so stoked on this?
She has your checking.</v>

437
00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:53.870
I know it's a jacket that makes people happy.

438
00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.660
So will you get involved in stuff like this?
Do you understand?

439
00:29:57.661 --> 00:30:01.890
I want you so bad you could wear your jacket and come make your little sponge

440
00:30:01.891 --> 00:30:06.750
stuff by both lunch 11 look how happy she is.
She's so happy.
Yeah.

441
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.460
Can we see more?
Can we play that again?
That was

442
00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:16.130
<v 8>card
being heavy.</v>

443
00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:18.470
Oh,
ah.

444
00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:28.940
Oh God.
Now think oh this way.

445
00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:32.490
And now we think,
oh my gosh.
Oh my gosh.

446
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:35.710
I can pay at a time.
Okay.
And then

447
00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:41.120
this was one night that I did not so hard.

448
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.650
<v 3>I love it.
I love her so much.
Can I take that?</v>

449
00:30:46.651 --> 00:30:50.740
I get super excited about colors too.
Like that.
Like draw and stuff.
Yeah.

450
00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:56.570
I love art work like that.
Why?
I love colors too.
I get excited.
Uh,

451
00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:59.310
Michael's arts and crafts,
you know,
you're really excited going in here.

452
00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:01.980
You know what?
It brought us Aussies

453
00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.180
<v 0>to our attention.</v>

454
00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:09.570
The you are obviously known for your art teacher jacket.
Yeah.

455
00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:15.310
Somebody wrote in,
Oh God,
here we do the show.
No,

456
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:17.240
it's going to surprise you.
Okay.

457
00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:22.910
They said was the guy that was actually like,

458
00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:27.160
it's upsetting because you know how emotional I'm going to get about this.
Yeah.

459
00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.160
Let me show you.
I want people to be able to see you watching it.

460
00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:32.550
<v 3>Aw.</v>

461
00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:39.020
<v 0>We did not safe with Nikki Glaser.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

462
00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:44.370
oh look how nice that I know somebody wrote in Tom Genes.

463
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:48.280
Where to Tommy get this jacket from.
I know.
What brand is it?

464
00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:50.800
This is the greatest jacket I have ever seen.

465
00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:53.560
Much better than Tina's our teacher jacket.

466
00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:58.270
I must have it keep 'em high and tight.
Lots of love from mom.

467
00:31:58.271 --> 00:31:59.320
Born on mom's trail.
Yeah.

468
00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:04.020
<v 3>Oh Mel.
I love Melbourne.
It's mom born.
Sorry.
I love mom born.</v>

469
00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:06.840
Tell me you are going to get emotional and we've been talking about this jacket

470
00:32:06.841 --> 00:32:08.210
for weeks now.
Yeah.
Months.

471
00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:12.110
<v 0>Actually,
mm hmm.
So here's what happened,
man.
I,
um,</v>

472
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:16.210
I actually,
you know,
like a lot of things you going to like,
I,

473
00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:21.140
I've always wanted a nice jacket,
a nice leather jacket.
You never bought one.

474
00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:25.850
Yeah.
And not too long ago,
I think it was December,
November,

475
00:32:25.851 --> 00:32:26.684
December,

476
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:32.350
I bought the jacket you're seeing in this and it was the most expensive jacket

477
00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:38.410
I've ever bought and that was 55 0%

478
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:44.330
<v 6>off,
even with 50% off the most I've ever spent.</v>

479
00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:47.180
And I was like,
you know,
I justified it.
I was like,
yeah,
you know,

480
00:32:47.181 --> 00:32:50.990
you've never gotten a jacket like that.
Go ahead and buy that jacket.

481
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:55.460
And then there's something about jackets that are different than other articles

482
00:32:55.461 --> 00:32:59.750
of clothing where they start to feel like they're part of you,
you know,

483
00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:02.120
literally they envelop you,
envelop you,

484
00:33:02.121 --> 00:33:05.990
but it becomes like almost part of your personality.
Yeah.
Right.
The jacket,

485
00:33:05.991 --> 00:33:07.400
you become synonymous with you.

486
00:33:07.401 --> 00:33:11.300
You start wearing this jacket fit like a glove man.
And I just,

487
00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:16.390
I absolutely loved this jacket and from the day we moved here,

488
00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:23.240
I haven't found the jacket.
I've been looking.
You mean you lost it?
Well,

489
00:33:23.241 --> 00:33:26.540
I think I did lose it,
but I wasn't sure you would have kept a better eye on it.

490
00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:29.270
It's a really horrible thing to say to me.
Right.
Number softy.

491
00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:30.740
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

492
00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:34.740
<v 3>Number one,
I lost softy.
How sympathetic where you then sure.</v>

493
00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:38.540
Maybe you should have sown your name into the tag.

494
00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:40.970
<v 9>Oh,
I hate you so much.</v>

495
00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:46.310
<v 6>This jacket,
man.
I talked to my,</v>

496
00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:48.720
my whole shrink session last week was about this jacket.

497
00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:53.010
That's all I talked about was about losing this chat.
Yeah,
it's very traumatic.

498
00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:58.080
I haven't,
I've called hotels.
I just can't fucking figure it out.

499
00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:01.020
I know that the cause it,
it just bothers me that it's gone

500
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:05.730
<v 3>now.
This is,
okay,
so we shot this.
Is this the last time you wore that?
Oh,</v>

501
00:34:05.731 --> 00:34:07.920
I don't know man.
I don't know if it's the last time.

502
00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:12.630
I don't really shot this like,
right,
right.
Like I'm,
what a month before we moved.

503
00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:15.570
<v 6>Well,
I don't know if it was a month before it would get down to the details.</v>

504
00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:19.350
I mean,
there's certain things I know that happened where I had the jacket.

505
00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:23.020
You know?
I know when I got my photos taken,
I remember I had those.

506
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:26.490
I had the jacket for that.
I know that the jacket wasn't left there.

507
00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:30.540
I checked with her.
I know that obviously I had it for this.

508
00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:35.370
I know that I had it at a couple local gigs,
but you know,

509
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:36.480
I remember leaving with it.

510
00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:42.340
<v 3>It's gone,
but if fucking irritates the shit out of it.
Let me tell you something,</v>

511
00:34:42.341 --> 00:34:45.520
and you're shrank.
Said this to you too.
Yeah.
Jackie Karma.

512
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.870
You lose a jacket and you're going to gain an even better jacket.
Just watch.

513
00:34:49.910 --> 00:34:51.220
You'll see it.
It'll come to you.

514
00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:53.770
You're going to go to the same story that you got that at and you're going to

515
00:34:53.771 --> 00:34:56.830
find an even better deal and it's going to be great.
Prompts me out.

516
00:34:56.890 --> 00:35:00.190
I know you have to let it go.
You've got to let it go.
Tom.

517
00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:04.480
The jacket's gone jacket like kind of tell you what I really noticed.

518
00:35:04.481 --> 00:35:09.010
Not so much this,
but the hair looks great.
That haircut is that Allen.

519
00:35:09.011 --> 00:35:12.460
He did that right before.
And your beard.
This is the right leg.
Three.
Yeah.

520
00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:15.610
Do you know that?
It thinks I look like a fucking fat dog.
Shit.

521
00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:19.500
But you look amazing.
I had just given birth like weeks before Amy Hyde.

522
00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:23.500
You didn't know.
Let me get fed age 10,000 years be you look,
amaze.

523
00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:28.650
And this is nice.
The color,
the cut really nicely.

524
00:35:28.651 --> 00:35:29.950
How great that jacket is.

525
00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:33.550
I tell you why it's not nice because it's too shiny for camera.

526
00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:38.070
You look like you're about to hop on a motorcycle.
I got that when I bought

527
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:39.770
<v 6>my motorcycle.
Are you Dean Del Rey?</v>

528
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:44.213
<v 8>Okay.</v>

529
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:48.720
<v 6>Listen man,
you just gotta let it go and sometimes you lose shit and you know,</v>

530
00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:53.220
but you understand that bummer.
It's a bummer man.
Of course.
I've lost a softie.

531
00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.230
Remember my,
uh,
my childhood pillow,

532
00:35:55.231 --> 00:35:58.260
I it on the road and then one time I left softy behind.

533
00:35:58.261 --> 00:36:02.870
And you still like to remind me about it that when we're in bed sometimes,

534
00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:06.690
yeah,
kind of getting settled in.

535
00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:12.000
Do you remember when you left Softie,
but,
and you'll get really upset with me.

536
00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:14.370
Well,
it's really,
I didn't mean to leave her behind.

537
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:18.690
I was an early flight that morning,
a soft pillow.
I've had it.
So I was a child,

538
00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:23.640
I lost softy.
I know that is irreplaceable jacket,
you can replace that.

539
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:27.450
My shrink told me,
she goes,
well,
think of you know your jacket,
like Jacket Karma.

540
00:36:27.451 --> 00:36:29.820
Like you're saying that somebody just,

541
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:33.570
who could not buy that jacket just found it and was like,
oh,
this is,

542
00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:38.610
and now you gave it to him.
And she goes,
how does that make you feel?
And I go,

543
00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:43.230
well,
as long as I don't see it.
And she goes,
I'm sorry.

544
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.460
And I go,
I mean,
it's a fight.
It's a fine fantasy.
I can live with that.

545
00:36:47.461 --> 00:36:51.750
I don't see it.
I go,
but if I saw somebody wearing my jacket,
I would be like,

546
00:36:51.751 --> 00:36:55.320
give him a fucking jacket.
Of course it doesn't feel good.
And she was like,
Oh,

547
00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:00.960
I go actually had a fantasy that somebody tried to alter the jacket.

548
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:05.490
And then I took a knife and I cut the jacket up in front of them.
Oh Wow.

549
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:09.300
And she was like,
okay.
It's how so those talk about it.

550
00:37:09.301 --> 00:37:11.010
That's really good that you're talking about your honest,

551
00:37:11.011 --> 00:37:12.720
a horrible impulses though.

552
00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:16.590
That's huge therapy to be honest about your shittiness.
Like when I told her,

553
00:37:16.591 --> 00:37:20.490
I'm only like,
if I'm suffering,
I like it when you suffer too.
She has,

554
00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.290
she has like,
that's really bad.

555
00:37:22.291 --> 00:37:25.260
But I'm glad you shared that because when we can get rid of that impulse in me,

556
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.700
like if I'm unhappy,
you should be unhappy.
That's not,
no.
That's how,

557
00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:32.610
that's normal.
That's not normal.
You're not normal.

558
00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:37.090
And nothing's about the normal.
Yep.
Um,
this,

559
00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:39.630
sorry.
Listen,
we're going to have,

560
00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:43.230
there's going to be a great resolution to your loss jacket.
You'll see.

561
00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:46.980
Give it some time and first of all,
even if you get it replaced,

562
00:37:46.981 --> 00:37:49.740
it's not going to be the same.
It's not the same man.
It's never going to be,

563
00:37:49.741 --> 00:37:52.450
it's over.
It's already bought a replacement dragon.
You did?
Yeah.

564
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:57.660
Where is it ordered it online.
Is it the same?
It's similar,
but it's not the same.

565
00:37:58.810 --> 00:37:59.643
<v 8>Yeah.
Let it go.</v>

566
00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:04.490
<v 6>Yeah.
I need a jacket.
You gotta work?</v>

567
00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:10.070
<v 8>[inaudible].</v>

568
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:23.623
<v 6>Ooh,</v>

569
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:32.100
that's good.
This is gonna blow your panties.

570
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:37.660
I know,
I know.
And but switchbacks and are you today?
Good question.

571
00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:42.220
Um,
I am.
Hmm,

572
00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:50.230
that's a good question.
I'm feeling hungry.
So I guess Tracy,

573
00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:54.580
your dad lay Tracy.
Uh,
yeah,

574
00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:59.560
but I am planning my exercise so that's kind of more of a to thing.
Yeah.

575
00:38:59.561 --> 00:39:02.620
I'm feeling like Towanda today.
I feel like I'm taking care of my kids.

576
00:39:02.621 --> 00:39:06.610
I got my shit right.
Like [inaudible] has got her life together.

577
00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:08.470
She's got her life.

578
00:39:08.471 --> 00:39:11.380
I think twin has got her life together more than any of the other Braxton thing.

579
00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:16.370
So she's got a past like she's,
I think she got caught even fever.

580
00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:20.560
Look she out now.
There was a cop,

581
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.530
a police mug shot of her,
but did she doesn't do that stuff anymore.

582
00:39:23.531 --> 00:39:27.880
To what does a good girl?
Well,
what do you think of this?

583
00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:30.610
Like you kidding me right now?

584
00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:38.340
What the fuck tone rumors are that Tony the,

585
00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:43.060
this,
the real star of the Braxton clan.
Now Tamar.

586
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:47.350
But Tamar is really the breakout.
No,
no,
no.
This is legendary man.

587
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:50.950
But Tamar is really popular right now.
Dude,

588
00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:54.610
are we really going to have this conversation that you're comparing Tamer to

589
00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:57.620
Tony brand talent?
But I'm saying in terms of popularity,
right?
Yeah,

590
00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:02.830
very positive.
Very popular.
I'll give you that.
But by far the most,

591
00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:08.030
you know,
no,
no Tony Racks and there's no comparison there.
Toni Braxton,

592
00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:13.620
I sing just like sophisticated grammy award winning with the real deal from the

593
00:40:14.501 --> 00:40:19.501
Braxton clean is Tony and the rumors that she and Birdman are dating some

594
00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:25.510
respect on my name that's crazier than shit and nobody,

595
00:40:25.511 --> 00:40:28.780
like nobody would suspect that Tony would be into

596
00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:35.050
super thug right here.
But this whole facial tattoos stuff is out of control.

597
00:40:35.051 --> 00:40:39.810
It's real crazy,
man.
She seems classier than that's my board man.
Yeah.
Yeah.

598
00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:44.860
That's,
it's,
it's alarming beyond alarming.
Um,

599
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:46.780
like I can see her with baby face there.

600
00:40:46.781 --> 00:40:50.440
She's always talking about him and they work together.
Baby face.

601
00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:52.160
I don't know if the,
as if

602
00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:57.760
is saying here that did Tony just confirmed birdman is her man.

603
00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:03.400
This says that they've allegedly been dating for months.
Oh my God.

604
00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:08.020
God.
Are you,
are you sad?
It's just,

605
00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:12.280
it's very strange to me.
I mean,
I could see that it can happen,

606
00:41:12.281 --> 00:41:15.130
but it's very strange.

607
00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:19.780
48 year old had been spending time with Birdman on Sunday.

608
00:41:19.781 --> 00:41:20.980
He was seeing getting cozy,

609
00:41:20.981 --> 00:41:24.750
this is like a week ago at her grammy performance in Brooklyn.
Um,

610
00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:29.680
there was sealed off,
I guess they did a song years ago.
Oh,
they done?

611
00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:34.250
Maybe.
I Dunno.
I Dunno.
It's just,

612
00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:39.080
<v 0>I would never think that,
uh,
that those two would be a couple.</v>

613
00:41:39.081 --> 00:41:43.160
Especially when you watch that show,
you see how she is,
you don't see her.

614
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:48.410
But you know,
maybe he's like one of those guys who uh,
you know,

615
00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:52.730
like every,
every dog has a soft heart man.
That's true.
Tom,

616
00:41:52.731 --> 00:41:57.290
you don't know the bird man can be very sensitive.
Yeah.
An R and B,

617
00:41:57.291 --> 00:42:00.230
you don't know that.
You don't know if he's just does all this,
you know,

618
00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:02.090
shit talking,
uh,

619
00:42:02.091 --> 00:42:05.510
when he has a lot of people around and the cameras and,

620
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:10.460
but at home he's a,
he's a real sweet bird.
You never know.

621
00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:14.730
You never know.
This is what the closed doors,
they bread.

622
00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.570
I think I talked about it on maybe on the breakfast club.

623
00:42:17.571 --> 00:42:20.540
We'll see if they break it down for us.
I love that movie.

624
00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:23.213
<v 9>Gotcha.</v>

625
00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:30.840
<v 11>That is the thing that Toni Braxton is dating Birdman.</v>

626
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:35.340
I seen it and that they'd been dating for quite some time now and it's been

627
00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:38.760
under wraps,
but they just recently where it together.

628
00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:40.050
I'll put some respect on that.

629
00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.020
Kobe is band last night too.

630
00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.620
<v 0>I don't know if that's all right,</v>

631
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:49.520
but I thought it was a little more insight than that.
I'm just shocked having,

632
00:42:49.521 --> 00:42:52.310
like I said,
watch the show.
Uh,

633
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:55.310
you see the way that she is doesn't seem like a match,
but you know,

634
00:42:55.311 --> 00:42:56.540
sometimes you can't

635
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:59.800
<v 3>predict will look.
Sometimes the good girl likes the thug.</v>

636
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:04.220
You look at Whitney Houston.
Yeah.
And what's his name?
Robbie Brown.

637
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:06.960
[inaudible] Brown.
Christina.
Bobbi.
Bobbi Kristina.
Let's do it.

638
00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:10.100
<v 0>Is so much more thugs in that though.
Real?
No,
I want to,
yeah,</v>

639
00:43:10.101 --> 00:43:14.690
he's got facial tattoos.
Not just that man.
This is the real thing.
I mean,

640
00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:18.080
look,
he's a CEO.
He's worth the $150 million.

641
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:20.750
So that makes up for a while.

642
00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:26.600
But I mean you can't compare a Bobby Brown,
Bobby Brown was just,
you know,

643
00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:30.850
the guy that was drinking and smoking and showing up late and that,
that kind of,

644
00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:33.260
she's not like a thug.
This guy has,
you know,

645
00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:36.740
we'll come in with eight dudes and kick your fucking door down.

646
00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.480
Shit might go down all night.

647
00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:41.403
<v 9>Right.</v>

648
00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:45.760
<v 0>I feel like he's already upset.
That's right baby y'all are y'all finished?</v>

649
00:43:45.761 --> 00:43:50.650
Are Y'all done?
We're done
kind of a,
I dunno.
I thought that was,

650
00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:51.890
<v 3>but they liked the thugs.</v>

651
00:43:51.891 --> 00:43:56.891
The good girls like the thugs and Tony is so disciplined and so a straight,

652
00:43:56.961 --> 00:43:59.360
you know,
if she takes care of her kid where you liked that.

653
00:43:59.361 --> 00:44:02.960
Did you like the thugs?
You're a good girl.
Yeah,
and high school.

654
00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:06.080
Only in high school I had a boyfriend that had a competition with his best

655
00:44:06.081 --> 00:44:08.090
friend to see how long they could go without showering.

656
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:11.550
And that was the only extent of it.
And that's a bad boy to you.

657
00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:16.650
He was pretty gross.
Well,
that's a gross boy necessarily a bad boy.
No,
I,

658
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:20.240
you know,
no,
no.
I,
I liked the people that treated me kindly.

659
00:44:20.241 --> 00:44:24.410
I didn't like bad boy shit.
I don't need that.
I don't have time for that.

660
00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:28.130
Ain't nobody got time for that.
I know how to got down with that.

661
00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:33.000
<v 0>Um,
real quick,
we this a email here and want to read.</v>

662
00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:38.610
Hey Hitler.
Uh,
I recently saw Tom's performance and Jack me off fill.

663
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:40.950
It was even better than I expected.

664
00:44:40.951 --> 00:44:44.190
And shout out to Pat House who was fucking hilarious.

665
00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:48.780
I am a huge fan of the mommy podcasts and it's the only thing that keeps me sane

666
00:44:48.781 --> 00:44:52.230
when I'm staring at paperwork every work day at the show.

667
00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:56.670
I was sitting in the front row and at one point Tom pointed to me and asked me

668
00:44:56.671 --> 00:45:00.480
how my year was going.
I replied and I was wearing them a high end type,

669
00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:05.610
but he didn't seem to want to bring up the podcast.
You guys are awesome.

670
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:08.280
I will always be looking forward to seeing your act.
My question is,

671
00:45:08.281 --> 00:45:12.690
how do you feel about the crowd yelling out?
Only things true.

672
00:45:12.691 --> 00:45:16.350
Mommy's would know about p I'd be honored if he brought this up.

673
00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:19.570
A PSM also poly and by um,

674
00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:24.420
<v 3>oh better you non-binary,
respectful.</v>

675
00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:26.880
The pronouns she day,

676
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:31.190
<v 0>they and them will not appreciate it.
I look man,
um,
first of all,</v>

677
00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:36.520
always appreciate our fans that listen to the show that come to shows.

678
00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:40.810
People yell stuff out.
It's fine.
What I only thing I always try to,
like,

679
00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:45.010
I think most people understand this is that when you go to a standup show,

680
00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:46.570
you're at a standup show.

681
00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:51.690
So just don't expect that that will be an extension or a representative of the

682
00:45:52.451 --> 00:45:56.820
podcast because it's just two different things.
So,
uh,
you know,
yeah.

683
00:45:56.890 --> 00:46:00.930
People yell stuff out from this show.
Hey Hitler.
And uh,

684
00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:04.850
you got my posey talking to me.
All these things from the podcast and uh,

685
00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:06.800
you know,
so it's just,
it,

686
00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:10.780
it's only weird if somebody expects that the show,

687
00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:14.950
like the standup show will be about the podcast.

688
00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:20.170
<v 3>Yeah.
I don't mind it.
Like when I go up to when I'm walking up to the stage,</v>

689
00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:23.840
I like it when they're like,
yeah.
And then it lets me know that there's mommies.

690
00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:26.670
Yeah.
But then there's like one time where I was about,
you know,

691
00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:30.500
halfway through my set and like a drunk mommy was like,
you know,

692
00:46:30.501 --> 00:46:34.410
just yelling out all of our sayings top like yeah but now it does.

693
00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:37.090
What are you doing?
Well what are you sure?

694
00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:41.780
I know like I was like what do you expect to happen though?
Yeah.
I don't know.

695
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:44.420
And it doesn't want it.
That's okay.
In moderation.

696
00:46:44.421 --> 00:46:47.240
I think everything in moderation.
Yeah.
It's fine to be excited.

697
00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:51.840
That's my point is that the standup is just about like you're not,

698
00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:54.290
it's not about the,
yeah cause we can't stop what we're doing.

699
00:46:54.291 --> 00:46:56.480
And then just like rattle off sayings from the show.

700
00:46:56.481 --> 00:46:59.120
Cause then cause there are people in the audience is also don't listen to your

701
00:46:59.121 --> 00:47:03.060
mom.
Yeah.
And they're like,
but it's different.
If you go to a live podcast

702
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:05.420
will mean the,

703
00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:10.340
then obviously we'll look dressings that are not the podcasts cause people like

704
00:47:10.341 --> 00:47:11.510
in the middle of my cell and be like,

705
00:47:11.511 --> 00:47:13.550
show me how those big tits far and you like,

706
00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:17.090
I got to explain this for the other hand.
Somebody did the,
I remembered,

707
00:47:17.091 --> 00:47:17.840
I don't remember that

708
00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:20.390
<v 0>this guy's the interaction.
I remember,
uh,</v>

709
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:25.630
like a month ago I was somewhere and this guy goes a crazy lokes and I go,

710
00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:31.330
what?
And he's like crazy lokes and I go,
what about him?
And he goes,

711
00:47:31.331 --> 00:47:35.860
what about him?
What do you,
what do you want me to do right now?
Yeah.

712
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:36.390
Weird beard.

713
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:40.240
Like and then do you understand that there's like 350 people at the show?
Yeah.

714
00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:45.550
So now I you want me to like I have to put it in context for everybody.

715
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:49.390
You want me to do the whole for them to understand who that is.

716
00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:54.420
Like I would have to really spend 10 minutes just giving the idea of who that

717
00:47:56.711 --> 00:47:57.170
is.

718
00:47:57.170 --> 00:48:00.740
<v 3>Ports explain it.
Like,
dude,
I,
you know,
cause one time I tried explaining that.</v>

719
00:48:00.741 --> 00:48:02.120
Would you rather that we did?

720
00:48:02.121 --> 00:48:05.360
Would you rather be retarded or get dragged off by your grandfather on the

721
00:48:05.361 --> 00:48:10.330
Ferris wheel?
The audience was not keen.
Really half of them were like,
ah,
yeah,

722
00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:13.220
shit,
I got to dig out of this hole.

723
00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:15.900
But it's because people that listen to this show,
when you,

724
00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:19.460
you say something like that context is there.
You don't have to,

725
00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:21.200
that's why I live podcast.

726
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:24.920
Where you're talking about podcast up is going to be much easier to navigate.

727
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:28.160
You know what,
I'm just this totally unrelated,

728
00:48:28.161 --> 00:48:32.600
but what kind of bear do you think you are?
Why?

729
00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:39.040
I'm looking at your beard and I'm seeing all kinds of colors and I'm thinking,

730
00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:42.800
are you grizzly or your polar brown bear bipolar.

731
00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:48.370
Are you a brown bear?
I got,
that was a really good joke.
You did right there.

732
00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:51.620
Someone else's,
Oh,
I'm sure if someone said it too,
but it's really I,

733
00:48:51.621 --> 00:48:53.150
it's appropriate.
Oh,
bipolar bear.

734
00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:57.470
Polar bipolar bear here by Polly Polly and by bear.
Jeez,

735
00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:02.990
I'm a bipolar bear.
That's it.
You nailed it by volley there.

736
00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:06.380
There's no need to have a good discussion anymore.
Chrisley what kind of barrel?

737
00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:10.880
Our Panda Panda's tower.
Yeah.

738
00:49:10.881 --> 00:49:12.560
They're so cute.
You ain't bamboo.

739
00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:16.610
You couldn't be a panda cause you're Jen's hall.
I feel like with all the Brown,

740
00:49:16.611 --> 00:49:17.660
I gotta be a brown butter.

741
00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:23.000
I make so much brown guys right in.

742
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:28.030
Let us know which bear Tom is or just tweet tweeted him at [inaudible] dot com

743
00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:30.920
Tom at Tom to grow.
Let them know if you're,

744
00:49:30.921 --> 00:49:35.180
especially if you're gay and you're in the bear community.
Okay,
thanks.

745
00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:36.200
I'm in the bear community.

746
00:49:36.201 --> 00:49:40.950
Different types of bears or is it just stripped bear cub?
I don't know hers.

747
00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:44.480
Why are you asking me is you have a huge fan base that's bear,

748
00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:46.760
but they don't tell me what the details are,

749
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:52.000
but just days his post on my Instagram account.
Mm MM.

750
00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:58.580
I love it so much that you have a bear of following.
You mean a find one?

751
00:49:58.670 --> 00:50:01.560
I'd love to.
Let's see these columns.
I'll show you.
Um,

752
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.470
I'd say you're a grizzly though,

753
00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:08.210
cause you do shed a lot in the woods and you eat Saulman out of the river and

754
00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:10.370
you know you're more feral.

755
00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:16.120
<v 0>Okay.
Mommy's listening to this week's podcast.
Feeling inspired.</v>

756
00:50:16.121 --> 00:50:18.730
Why stop with giving just tore city better names.

757
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.400
The real mommy's need upgraded monikers.

758
00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:25.480
Tom Segura could be come shit poo poorer.

759
00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:28.250

765
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:48.950
What talented listeners we have should be able to keep it high and tight with

766
00:50:48.951 --> 00:50:53.480
some names like that by Hitler.
Charlie.
Thank you Charlie.
Thanks Charlie.

767
00:50:53.481 --> 00:50:57.920
That was really good and inspiring.
Yeah.
Um,
it's a very,

768
00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:03.590
very sort of binary suggestion.
Uh,
oh,

769
00:51:03.591 --> 00:51:08.240
where's the,
uh,
uh,
do you want to hear the ultimate vocal fry guy?

770
00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:10.940
Yeah.
Uh,

771
00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:13.660
<v 8>oh,
this,</v>

772
00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:31.853
you

773
00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:37.723
know,

774
00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:56.290
<v 9>right.
Even here,
how he normally,
no,</v>

775
00:51:56.810 --> 00:52:01.760
<v 6>no.
Normal talking.
That's all he does.
He's speaking Swedish,</v>

776
00:52:01.761 --> 00:52:03.560
isn't it?
That that's yeah,
that's how you do it.

777
00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:16.800
<v 8>No,
no</v>

778
00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:22.950
<v 6>dude,
it's ridiculous.
Hey guys,</v>

779
00:52:22.951 --> 00:52:24.800
that's got to give us the gall a run for his money.

780
00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:29.280
How do we find how to refine this one?
This one was sent in,
right?

781
00:52:29.281 --> 00:52:31.910
When someone send this friend,
I think you forwarded.
Oh,

782
00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:36.370
but someone sent it to me.
Yeah.
This guy's a bear too.
He is.
He's got all,

783
00:52:36.371 --> 00:52:39.850
he's a fan.
That's how I found out about it.
That's how I found out.
Yeah.

784
00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:40.810
He's a polar bear.
Yeah.

785
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:42.503
<v 8>Ah.</v>

786
00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:48.510
<v 6>So stupid.
I know.</v>

787
00:52:50.310 --> 00:52:54.300
He looks like he's about to die to like some really unhealthy.

788
00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:59.100
You think this guy is unhealthy?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Dot.
Good.

789
00:52:59.101 --> 00:53:03.360
Cause he gonna die any minute and it's really not good.
No.
Um sure.
Ride Day.

790
00:53:03.361 --> 00:53:06.330
Part Day.
Where's the fucking thing we were watching earlier?

791
00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:09.760
Remember that the thing we were watching together,

792
00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:13.880
you're like that has to be played on the show.
Do you what I'm talking about?

793
00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:18.280
Let me,
let me see if I can find it myself.
I got,
I thought it were,

794
00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:21.970
oh it must've been something that just came up.
I didn't realize that.

795
00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:25.580
<v 12>I don't know know.</v>

796
00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:32.080
<v 6>See if I can
wait,
wait,</v>

797
00:53:32.090 --> 00:53:35.860
where were we?
I got it.
I got it when you were in bed.
Um,

798
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:40.360
cause I thought it kind of,
you know,
made sense to play with this

799
00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:42.913
number now.

800
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:48.660
<v 13>Yeah.
In school system has told you all your life.</v>

801
00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:53.190
Hitler was the most evil man to ever live.
Unfortunately,

802
00:53:53.191 --> 00:53:58.191
you are taught lies and he most likely believed Hitler is very rarely accurately

803
00:53:58.501 --> 00:53:59.790
portrayed.
You know,

804
00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:03.240
even Churchill once said that the victors write the history books,

805
00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:07.380
but we hear about Hitler through the media and the school says is extremely

806
00:54:07.381 --> 00:54:08.214
biased.

807
00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:15.750
<v 6>Oh my God.
Oh my God.
First of all,</v>

808
00:54:15.751 --> 00:54:20.130
stop the lies.
Um,
or a VA.

809
00:54:20.250 --> 00:54:23.880
This antisemitic.
Shut it down.
Six gazillionaires.

810
00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:26.370
Oh my God.
I mean,
look,

811
00:54:26.371 --> 00:54:31.371
we have actual footage of Hitler saying killing the Jews,

812
00:54:31.671 --> 00:54:36.300
the final solution and now we have footage of him being a creep.

813
00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:36.900
Wait a minute.

814
00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:40.860
Are you disputing with watching this video right now and the people,

815
00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:45.810
<v 14>cause they don't want to.
I'm going to tell you the truth,</v>

816
00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:48.170
by the way,
in this,
at least in the intro,

817
00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:51.200
all the images of him or smiling or laughing,

818
00:54:52.930 --> 00:54:54.250
this guy's super nice.

819
00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:58.510
<v 13>This is why Hitler was not evil.
In fact,
he was the opposite of that.</v>

820
00:54:58.930 --> 00:55:02.980
He was a very strong leader and a brilliant man.
I'd off Hitler,

821
00:55:02.981 --> 00:55:07.240
truly cared about his people and his country that he institutionalized.

822
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:10.110
<v 6>She's a real sweet voice.</v>

823
00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:18.170
And then he was evil that they chose a little girl to narrate.
Wait,

824
00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:20.130
but I'm,
we're not going to see why Hillary is a good guy.

825
00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:24.690
Curious to know what the argument is.
This cool video idea,

826
00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:29.240
was this in my sheet or no
download boobs submitted.

827
00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:31.880
It was submitted.
Okay.
That's where I came.
I didn't know where it came from

828
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:35.460
<v 13>after on that.
C is a slur for national socialist.</v>

829
00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:38.880
National Socialism is a world view and philosophy.

830
00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:42.180
<v 6>By the way,
I didn't actually know that until I watched this video.</v>

831
00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:44.650
I learned that Nazi is,

832
00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:49.260
is an national socialism by watching a video called why,

833
00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:54.450
why Hitler was an evil.
I had no idea.
Oh my whole life.
That,

834
00:55:54.451 --> 00:55:55.380
that's what that stood for.

835
00:55:56.390 --> 00:56:01.310
<v 13>Nationalism is the individual's responsibility twice the community for the</v>

836
00:56:01.311 --> 00:56:02.144
country.

837
00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:06.530
<v 6>Yeah.
And then I love you.
Love the Jews.</v>

838
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:11.440
<v 13>Socialism is the community's responsibility and love towards the individualized.</v>

839
00:56:11.650 --> 00:56:15.040
<v 6>I don't know that most people always define these words with love in the</v>

840
00:56:15.041 --> 00:56:15.874
definition.

841
00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:19.890
<v 13>Basically the one who does the most for the community has the highest social</v>

842
00:56:19.891 --> 00:56:22.230
status instead of the one with the most.

843
00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:25.580
<v 6>Okay.
Uh,</v>

844
00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:28.870
they use a picture of little Wayne laying on a pile of money.

845
00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:33.290
I think the people that made this might not be,
um,

846
00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:35.763
racist.

847
00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:41.640
<v 13>Along with that was a process of class unification is going to be a really long</v>

848
00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:42.610
day.

849
00:56:42.610 --> 00:56:46.300
<v 6>Yeah.
Well anyway,
it wasn't his fault.</v>

850
00:56:46.350 --> 00:56:49.150
They're trying [inaudible] denies the Holocaust.
It's so crazy.

851
00:56:49.151 --> 00:56:51.940
I mean the San People that deny the moon landing,
right.

852
00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:56.230
Holocaust never happened.
It's pretty,
it's pretty small group now.

853
00:56:56.231 --> 00:57:00.380
We still get together like,
um,
first Thursday of every month.
So,
uh,

854
00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:02.740
I already went this one bed in June.
We'll go again.

855
00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:07.600
But it's a pretty small group.
Holocaust deniers.
Yeah,
that's,
that's a very,

856
00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:12.010
you have to be a real specific piece of shit.
Special special group.

857
00:57:12.070 --> 00:57:15.610
How do you deny and the Albert the footage,
they faked all the footage of,

858
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:20.560
of death camps and bodies and um,
if you got,
I guess if you talked to them,

859
00:57:20.561 --> 00:57:23.200
they do believe that,
that it's like,
yeah,
like they're like,

860
00:57:23.201 --> 00:57:27.640
it's a few thousand people.
That's what they think.
They think that,
you know,
yeah.

861
00:57:27.641 --> 00:57:31.900
You feel like more is bad.
You had a camera roll and you saw some bad shit.

862
00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:36.070
All right.
That's,
that's kind of,
yeah,
that's the spin of it,
I think.
Wow.

863
00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:41.710
You sound,
I mean,
there's one day,
it was just one bad day.
Yeah.

864
00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:46.300
Yeah.
Everybody else.
Everyone's been making it up.
Um,
give Hitler a break.
Yeah.

865
00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:51.360
So this guy stole a car in the UK and didn't know that the car that he stole had

866
00:57:54.791 --> 00:57:58.870
a dash cam that was not just recording video,

867
00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:04.100
but his audio.
Oh,

01:05:06.210 --> 01:05:08.440
You need a small army to take out these two gangs.

970
01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:13.780
I'm thinking several guys with machine guns.
A couple of make in the alley.

971
01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:18.120
I'm going to take out the receipts.
Throw me

972
01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:19.143
<v 8>how many guys?</v>

973
01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:28.820
Just one guy.

974
01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:36.100
His name is Colonel Robert Sex bags compared to Robert Bag.

975
01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:40.850
Mostly units.
Well,
he's your most silver weight.

976
01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:45.670
300 pounds the most.
Knowing his wife,
his wife

977
01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:48.500
killed him.
The drive by shooting.

978
01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:54.890
The last time I asked the CIA,
you might even wonder if he ever existed.

979
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:59.220
Did you have your life to save the world?

980
01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:07.540
<v 6>What'd you,
you live to save the world and nobody knew you did it.</v>

981
01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:11.920
<v 8>No defend against all enemies.</v>

982
01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:17.470
I still love my country.

983
01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:21.340
I still love my family and I'm still it on again.

984
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:27.390
<v 6>He's out of his,
this a Louisiana hot sauce commercial.</v>

985
01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:34.600
I love my country.
It's crazy.
I can still shoot a bullet.
Okay.
Tasting for,

986
01:06:34.730 --> 01:06:39.020
for the absolute elite soldier that he is.
Yes.
He's a little heavy.

987
01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:43.310
A little heavy.
You think so?
You don't think that most of the uh,

988
01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:48.640
special forces guys are like three 2130 I've been,

989
01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:54.770
I've never seen a,
a special forces guy looked that Husky.
Yeah.
Yeah,

990
01:06:55.480 --> 01:07:00.250
but old.
Very old for a special forces elite.
Yeah.
I Dunno.

991
01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:04.100
Don't they force you to retire?
Uh,
no.
Seen a thing that too.

992
01:07:04.590 --> 01:07:08.000
I know how to fight.
I Dunno.
What the fuck.
He's so crazy.

993
01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:09.300
<v 8>Setting the record straight.</v>

994
01:07:18.450 --> 01:07:21.660
<v 6>More excited about his other one.
There's another is the other trailer in here,</v>

995
01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:27.090
these pieces of shit just get better and better men.
Oh my gosh.

996
01:07:27.091 --> 01:07:31.920
And he keeps cranking them out.
It's like woody Allen movies.
One a year.

997
01:07:32.010 --> 01:07:34.320
Steven Seagal.
The woody.
Oh,
more than one a year.

998
01:07:34.321 --> 01:07:38.040
That's the great thing about him.
Uh,
you know what we should do?

999
01:07:38.041 --> 01:07:41.880
I wish we could do this as rent out a movie theater and do like a rocky horror

1000
01:07:41.881 --> 01:07:46.740
picture show with Steven Seagal movies and have just mommy's and we all watch it

1001
01:07:46.741 --> 01:07:50.370
and make fun of it.
What we're going to do something like that on patriotic.

1002
01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:55.190
I'll first round.
We're going to do that,
like have a screening and we can uh,

1003
01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:56.850
babe,
have you not been here?
No,
no,
no,

1004
01:07:56.851 --> 01:08:00.200
but I'm saying it'd be funny to do it in a live theater.
Merrigan happen,

1005
01:08:00.201 --> 01:08:03.140
but I would want to,
we don't do that.
We can do that too.
Yeah.

1006
01:08:03.290 --> 01:08:05.550
And we can comments area and invite.
We can do that.

1007
01:08:06.050 --> 01:08:09.460
You know it's a pipe dream though,
Tom.
I Dunno.
Not America.

1008
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.560
Okay.
This one.

1009
01:08:13.770 --> 01:08:18.290
<v 8>Awesome.
When I raise your hand,
you go up.</v>

1010
01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:22.700
When I raised it down,
you go up.

1011
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:26.430
All of these things are things that manipulate.

1012
01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:32.520
Those are all the things that really make for the old command boy.
Yeah.

1013
01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:37.060
<v 6>Is eating a sandwich right now.</v>

1014
01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:41.550
<v 8>I need that can successfully take out the next outcome.
So</v>

1015
01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:46.380
<v 6>yeah,
they don't even sound,
they don't audio mix his trailers.</v>

1016
01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:50.940
We need some money and then they turn the music up.
So as he's talking,

1017
01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:56.720
this is a key point of this trailer and they audio makes it so poorly.

1018
01:08:57.150 --> 01:08:58.350
You don't even know what he says.

1019
01:09:00.230 --> 01:09:01.500
<v 8>Take out the next outcome.</v>

1020
01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:07.530
<v 6>Cut that trailer was like,
yeah,</v>

1021
01:09:07.531 --> 01:09:12.531
it's ready to go and you cannot heal and he needs the yellow sunglasses.

1022
01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:16.410
So you can't even see the expression in his eyes.

1023
01:09:16.411 --> 01:09:20.550
There's no emotion being conveyed and you know the next year,

1024
01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:26.880
<v 8>take out the next outcome.
Condo,</v>

1025
01:09:28.230 --> 01:09:29.410
vocal fry guy.

1026
01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:39.370
There was a woman,
if she was irrelevant,

1027
01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:42.500
you were ordered to eliminate everyone.

1028
01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:45.250
This is what I would call unexcusable

1029
01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:48.750
<v 6>inexcusable.
I believe that unexcusable no,</v>

1030
01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:52.750
this is missing those trailers missing everything.
I'm saying fuck a lot.

1031
01:09:52.810 --> 01:09:56.270
I liked those trailers when he's like,
it's just a fucking joke.
Yeah,

1032
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:59.490
the fucking kick all your fucking acids.
Well those trailers,

1033
01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:04.570
two minutes 36 that's already too long or too short.

1034
01:10:04.571 --> 01:10:06.040
If you're used to Seagal trailers.

1035
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:08.950
I like us to golf five or six minute trailer already,

1036
01:10:08.951 --> 01:10:11.320
50 seconds and we have no idea what this is about.

1037
01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:15.900
<v 8>Nice to buy something weak.
Something sentiment</v>

1038
01:10:19.050 --> 01:10:19.883
shit.

1039
01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:31.640
A perfect,
well I will.

1040
01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:39.260
<v 6>I think I understand the movie now.
What is it they kidnapped?</v>

1041
01:10:39.261 --> 01:10:40.980
They took that guy.
Okay.

1042
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:45.950
And they're going to make him into like a manufactured warrior.
Oh,
okay.

1043
01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:49.700
This like terminator.
I mean they could have gotten to that way sooner,

1044
01:10:49.730 --> 01:10:52.970
way sooner and they showed a lot of things that have nothing to do with that,

1045
01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:54.200
but I think that's what's going on.

1046
01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:58.540
<v 8>See now he's breaking out of the lab.</v>

1047
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:07.280
<v 6>I'm surprised that the signed up for a movie where he doesn't play the central</v>

1048
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:10.730
the weapon.
He's not the guy.
It's weird,
right?
Yeah.
What if they're like,

1049
01:11:10.731 --> 01:11:13.710
but there's no,
you know why a hundred pound weapon,
you know,

1050
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:17.550
it's because he needs to be the trainer,
the teacher to the weapon.

1051
01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:20.240
He wants to be the guys like I chore.
No,

1052
01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:24.490
he'll diff when the weapon gets too powerful,
he'll defeat the weapon.
Yeah.
Right.

1053
01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:29.480
<v 8>Yeah.
Cause that was coming and
questioning command.</v>

1054
01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:35.000
No one is safe.
How are we going to be safe

1055
01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:40.290
and is a target of time to making the ultimate killing machine

1056
01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:46.500
as nights off,
I'm exhausted.

1057
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:50.150
Aren't too many lives were lost.
You get this thing.

1058
01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:54.150
<v 6>Can you give us a stick to the script</v>

1059
01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:59.180
<v 8>says almost there.
Okay.</v>

1060
01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:06.440
<v 6>Do you notice that he pulled out very clearly?</v>

1061
01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:09.500
You know something else about that moment and all the other moments we've seen

1062
01:12:09.501 --> 01:12:13.270
so far in this.
He's been sitting in every scene.
Yeah.

1063
01:12:14.090 --> 01:12:17.120
And then he trains a guy,
he's like,
give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

1064
01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:20.580
And he did this.
You should go up.
This makes you go down.
You miss or

1065
01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:36.030
<v 8>oh yeah.
So he's fighting weapon guy.
Oh boy.</v>

1066
01:12:36.031 --> 01:12:36.864
Here we go.

1067
01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:46.870
Tell me what's the meaning of this truth to you?
The only thing I know how to do,

1068
01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:52.720
<v 6>the other bad thing about a great fight scene too,
that they,</v>

1069
01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:53.660
you can tell they don't even,

1070
01:12:53.661 --> 01:12:57.650
do you notice that Seagal doesn't take any hits on that?
No.

1071
01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:59.330
So there's no stakes to the fight.

1072
01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:03.530
Great fight scene has a back and forth and he won't allow that.

1073
01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:06.530
Has Ego would never,
I think it's not even the ego.
I think he's like,

1074
01:13:06.531 --> 01:13:11.120
I don't want to move,
fall down and stuff and get back up.
So my hip hurts.
Yeah,

1075
01:13:11.121 --> 01:13:15.230
it's definitely because you're right.
He never takes us single hit.
No,

1076
01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.300
no one kicks it.
Like if you watch his old stuff,

1077
01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:21.590
there was more like the original stuff out for justice.
It was a back and forth.

1078
01:13:21.591 --> 01:13:24.680
Right.
But yeah,
but you're right.
It's cause he's too lazy to eat.
Yeah.

1079
01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:29.960
So we'll have him kind of kick your ass for none.
None.
None.
None.
That just,
okay.

1080
01:13:29.961 --> 01:13:32.780
Cause this,
and it seems so unbelievable.
This is like the,
you're right,

1081
01:13:32.781 --> 01:13:36.950
it was like the fifth movie of 2016.
It's all,
it's only may.
Yeah.

1082
01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:40.130
He's gotten 10 movies out on bullying.
Unbelievable.

1083
01:13:41.530 --> 01:13:45.990
Jesus man.
Fuck.
And that is way that you're right.
Way Too long in between,

1084
01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:50.720
you know,
the entire film.
Horrible.
The entire film.
There's no,
no.

1085
01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:55.820
So he defeats the ultimate weapon.
That's it.
End of story.
Jesus,
man.

1086
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:59.990
Um,
he really should lose a few though.
I mean,
look,

1087
01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:04.370
what do you mean you're an action star?
Some lbs.

1088
01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:10.030
I'm a little confused.
Uh,
I'll play the fat and say,

1089
01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:12.970
I've been talking to you a lot about this,
which is like,
you know,

1090
01:14:12.971 --> 01:14:17.590
we think is one of those things where if,
uh,
if you talk about it a lot,

1091
01:14:17.710 --> 01:14:20.060
we should do something about it.
Yeah.
And so

1092
01:14:20.410 --> 01:14:21.243
<v 4>here's a little</v>

1093
01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:27.330
side show recently began producing its fifth year of content,

1094
01:14:27.331 --> 01:14:29.560
something that we are extremely proud of.

1095
01:14:29.630 --> 01:14:32.250
We're also proud of the community that's grown up around these videos.

1096
01:14:32.251 --> 01:14:35.740
We've covered a lot of topics,
both trivial and a profound,
and

1097
01:14:35.890 --> 01:14:38.530
<v 6>this is what sideshow,
is that what it's called?
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1098
01:14:38.970 --> 01:14:42.980
<v 4>Very hard to capture both our fascination and excitement as well as our</v>

1099
01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:47.940
chancellor.
I took a hosting class year.
You may have a chance to comment on.

1100
01:14:47.941 --> 01:14:52.710
We think every single side show video asking us one question.

1101
01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:56.730
We have ignored this question long enough.
It is time.
We took it on Lido.

1102
01:14:56.731 --> 01:15:01.650
Johnny wants to know why does he have hair around his anus?
Well,
Johnny,
the reef,

1103
01:15:01.770 --> 01:15:06.120
<v 6>well they go on to explore this and the truth is that they said they really</v>

1104
01:15:06.150 --> 01:15:08.220
don't know.
Right?
We don't,
we don't know.

1105
01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:12.260
There's different theories in this video,
right?
One is that,
you know,

1106
01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:14.910
we're not evolutionarily perfect,

1107
01:15:15.090 --> 01:15:18.380
so there's certain things on us that um,

1108
01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:21.900
we just remnants of monkeys base.
Yeah,
I guess.

1109
01:15:21.901 --> 01:15:25.710
And that they haven't evolved to the point because there's nothing keeping it

1110
01:15:25.711 --> 01:15:29.550
from available.
I told you why last week.
Uh,
what's that?

1111
01:15:29.610 --> 01:15:32.460
To prevent the snakes from crawling up there and laying eggs.

1112
01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:35.550
Everybody knows that.
Snakes.
What about spiders?

1113
01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:41.280
Because if you're a hunter and gather,
you're sitting on rocks,

1114
01:15:41.281 --> 01:15:45.930
you're squatting and riverbeds stuck can crawl up there and lay eggs in your

1115
01:15:45.931 --> 01:15:50.640
anus.
And that's why it's good for scent.
That's right.
Trapping,

1116
01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:55.680
trapping in there can also sharing the scent.
If I go,
oh,

1117
01:15:55.681 --> 01:15:58.590
we want to sell Mel and I smell like when you put your nose down there.

1118
01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:01.890
That's true.
Sharing the,
this,
I bet it's something sent.

1119
01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:05.520
That's one of the theories.
Yeah.
It's interesting.
Sent one.
Well,

1120
01:16:05.521 --> 01:16:09.600
people have been commenting back and forth to me about what I'm going to do

1121
01:16:09.601 --> 01:16:14.050
moving forward.
People were telling me to trim it.
Somebody shaved it and trim it.

1122
01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:15.420
So why not trim it?

1123
01:16:15.630 --> 01:16:19.500
Because if you trim it the now it's stubbly and short and it's going to itch and

1124
01:16:19.501 --> 01:16:23.520
agitate your asshole,
even that's shaving is definitely going to do that.
Yeah,

1125
01:16:23.521 --> 01:16:26.250
but trimming and he go straight to irritation at least with shaving.

1126
01:16:26.251 --> 01:16:29.990
You got a couple of days of nice and then it gets so waxing.

1127
01:16:29.991 --> 01:16:32.670
It's kind of where we're at right now.
But that's paint yet.

1128
01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:36.030
Try Wax by wax a few times,

1129
01:16:36.330 --> 01:16:38.250
see if that diminishes the amount of hair.

1130
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:40.830
And somebody told me it's going go really badly though.
Why?

1131
01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:45.240
Because you're going to chase you also gonna feel the sweat more because like

1132
01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:48.090
hair prevents you,
you know,
it wicks away,

1133
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:53.220
clicks away you and you're fighting,
playing live.
I don't know man.
It's a,

1134
01:16:53.221 --> 01:16:56.360
it's an interesting conundrum.

1135
01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:00.950
That's a big word we know.
Wax Blacks on.

1136
01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:07.090
All right.
Um,
what else do you got?
Anything?
Well,
we're going to do that.

1137
01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:10.790
You haven't pulled up or no,
you have one point.
I have one that I wrote,
uh,

1138
01:17:10.850 --> 01:17:15.200
pacifically for you.
Oh,
okay.
Well let me see what I got here for you,

1139
01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:20.390
dude.
You do boop,
boop,
boop,
boop.
You got to keep it official?

1140
01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:29.150
<v 12>No ma'am.
Yeah.
The top layer</v>

1141
01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:36.820
homeless men

1142
01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:48.540
have sex with your sister to face grandmother,

1143
01:17:48.690 --> 01:17:53.100
Washington on you masturbating.
Never have another orgasm.

1144
01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:56.980
Would you rather?

1145
01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:00.553
<v 17>MMM,</v>

1146
01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:04.110
<v 6>we haven't answered you is because you know,</v>

1147
01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:07.440
despite the fact that everyone gets their own personal pocket sized

1148
01:18:07.441 --> 01:18:11.270
supercomputer and then we can send robots to Mars and convert the entire face,

1149
01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:15.270
law it to human use.
We still,
man,
that was a lot.

1150
01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:18.210
I mean,
I appreciate the work that guy did,
but that was,

1151
01:18:18.270 --> 01:18:22.400
there was too much for me.
You know what I'm saying?
So you have a,

1152
01:18:22.410 --> 01:18:23.340
what'd you rather?

1153
01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:24.473
<v 17>MMM,</v>

1154
01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.030
<v 6>yeah,
I like to hear about it.
It's just tailored to you.</v>

1155
01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:30.100
So this is not a universal one.

1156
01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:34.240
I just thought it'd be fun to do something just for you.
Are you ready?

1157
01:18:34.241 --> 01:18:36.630
Are you listening?
Are you typing or are you ready?
Are you,
are you here?

1158
01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:39.730
Are you all done?
You're finished.
You're done.
I'm ready.
I'm pulling up.

1159
01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:41.950
I'm pulling up another one just so that it's a,

1160
01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:46.370
well then do that one first and then we'll do your personal one.
Uh,

1161
01:18:46.570 --> 01:18:49.450
would you rather let one man with a tiny,

1162
01:18:49.570 --> 01:18:54.040
tiny penis but sexy to completion or let 30 guys come on your face.

1163
01:18:54.041 --> 01:18:57.790
So from Thomas Cheeses.
Wow.
That is thought provoking.
I see.

1164
01:18:57.791 --> 01:19:01.690
I don't think that's that challenging.
It's not cause it's so tiny.
It's so tiny.

1165
01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:05.560
Just let it happen.
Just let out.
But then you have it already loads.

1166
01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:11.290
That's true.
One tiny painter and he Jesus in your butthole.
Yeah.

1167
01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:13.040
<v 17>Yeah.</v>

1168
01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:18.020
<v 6>You're right.
30 loads on your face.
It's horrendous.
Is Tiny.
Tiny,
tiny twice.</v>

1169
01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:21.740
It's like,
it's like a micro penis.
It's fine.
Yeah.
I mean that one is,

1170
01:19:21.741 --> 01:19:24.650
to me it's easy.
It's like it's a no brainer guy.
Just come on my butt.

1171
01:19:27.490 --> 01:19:31.570
Uh,
uh.

1172
01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:35.900
What'd you rather pick up baby James [inaudible] in a little plastic bag for the

1173
01:19:35.901 --> 01:19:36.800
rest of his life.

1174
01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:42.160
Save it forever or put bitsy and Pfo in diapers and change them all the time.

1175
01:19:44.210 --> 01:19:46.430
Uh,
I put busy and thief and diverse.

1176
01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:50.780
Then change a or then pick up a human shit off the ground with a plastic bag for

1177
01:19:50.781 --> 01:19:54.320
life and keep it from like he goes to college and were like,
here it is Ellis.

1178
01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:54.561
Yeah.

1179
01:19:54.561 --> 01:19:57.830
Here's the thing is you would learn to accept the fact that you're just putting

1180
01:19:57.831 --> 01:20:00.350
these diapers on these dogs all the time.
You just roll with it,
you know?

1181
01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:04.550
Plus it would actually save our carpets because Betsy has been paying on them

1182
01:20:04.551 --> 01:20:07.360
and now she would be able to,
shit,
I hate when somebody is,

1183
01:20:07.361 --> 01:20:09.570
would you rather it looks like this,
you open,

1184
01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:12.990
would you rather email and it's like,
dude,
what?

1185
01:20:14.190 --> 01:20:15.210
Get to that point

1186
01:20:17.710 --> 01:20:21.900
because they're having like the right 40 in there.
You know?

1187
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:25.300
Now you're making me figure out which year.
What'd you rather,

1188
01:20:25.301 --> 01:20:30.300
these are worth a shit.
God dammit.
Go ahead.
I want to hear yours,
ma'am.
Okay.

1189
01:20:30.301 --> 01:20:32.700
This is just for you.
Okay?

1190
01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:36.120
What'd you rather listen to your dad

1191
01:20:36.930 --> 01:20:39.420
<v 3>tell the same story over and over</v>

1192
01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:45.960
for a one month.
Here's your full time Gig.
It's eight hours a day.

1193
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:50.280
You had an hour lunch,
two breaks,
but it's throughout the day.

1194
01:20:50.281 --> 01:20:54.300
He's just telling the story over and over for eight hours.
I gotta Tell Ya,

1195
01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:58.500
I would tell you about the time they were telling about the Orlando airport and

1196
01:20:58.501 --> 01:21:00.960
I'm like,
yeah,
I in the airport.

1197
01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:04.760
<v 6>Uh,
no,
he's,
I went to foreign</v>

1198
01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:08.870
<v 3>do my pants.
So I go,
I take my trousers off</v>

1199
01:21:10.450 --> 01:21:13.910
and he tells you the exact same way,
exact same cadence,
exact same words,

1200
01:21:14.930 --> 01:21:16.880
and you've got it.
Listen,
but you got to listen.

1201
01:21:16.881 --> 01:21:19.640
You can't tune out the way you tuned me out.
You got to listen

1202
01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:22.340
<v 6>babe.
Okay.</v>

1203
01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:27.590
Or you have to let your beard grow for a year.

1204
01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:32.990
<v 3>No trims,
nothing.
Just let it grow.
Let it get bushier.</v>

1205
01:21:33.230 --> 01:21:35.260
Let those flavors sinking.

1206
01:21:35.690 --> 01:21:40.690
They get itchy or let that top hair grow right into your mouth like it almost is

1207
01:21:40.701 --> 01:21:41.534
right now.

1208
01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:46.560
<v 6>That's it.
That's it.
It's so easy.
What are the fucking</v>

1209
01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:51.030
<v 3>beard,
man?
No,
but you told me last night I would have personal hell.</v>

1210
01:21:51.031 --> 01:21:52.680
It is for you and your beard is too long.

1211
01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:55.890
It's every day to my father for one month.

1212
01:21:56.490 --> 01:22:00.570
Your full time job is for one month your dad a year of the beard.

1213
01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:06.660
<v 6>Not even,
not even okay.
Quite about your beard,</v>

1214
01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:07.650
but with

1215
01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:12.700
<v 3>peads is stank on it.
You just ate pizza and it smells like that cheese.</v>

1216
01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:14.270
<v 6>That's different.</v>

1217
01:22:15.150 --> 01:22:17.850
<v 3>That's what I'm saying.
You,
you told me I had to up the second one,</v>

1218
01:22:17.851 --> 01:22:22.590
so I'm upping the stakes.
It's smells.
Smells like pizza.

1219
01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:27.270
Yeah.
So let's,
yeah,
let's get it as far as for a year.

1220
01:22:27.570 --> 01:22:27.961
So let's,

1221
01:22:27.961 --> 01:22:30.720
let's up the ante because I obviously I didn't make it severe enough for,

1222
01:22:30.721 --> 01:22:35.580
you know,
washing the beard and no trimming the beard for one year.

1223
01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:37.710
Everything.
You eat the flavor stand there

1224
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:41.101
now think about it.

1225
01:22:41.101 --> 01:22:44.070
It's going to fuck up your relationship with me cause I'm not going to want to

1226
01:22:44.071 --> 01:22:46.800
kiss you.
It's going to fuck up your relationship with Ellis.

1227
01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:48.240
He's not going to want to kiss you.

1228
01:22:48.650 --> 01:22:49.483
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

1229
01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:55.520
<v 3>I listen to my dad then,
but that's gonna make me suicidal.</v>

1230
01:22:57.050 --> 01:23:01.730
If he tells me the same story three times in a week,
I go fucking crazy.
I know.

1231
01:23:01.731 --> 01:23:04.340
That's why I picked it.
I know.
It's good personal hell garden.

1232
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:06.340
I also hate when my beard smells like farts.

1233
01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:09.640
<v 6>I know.
That's why I chose it.
It's really,
it's interesting.</v>

1234
01:23:09.970 --> 01:23:14.530
I think that the smell is enough of a deterrent where I would take the

1235
01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:19.400
psychological trauma because I know it'll end in a god buddy.

1236
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:23.330
David.
Tell you the time at the Orlando Airport and see those,

1237
01:23:23.331 --> 01:23:26.870
or at least funny stories.
There's one thing that tells me,
I know,
it's like,

1238
01:23:26.871 --> 01:23:29.750
it's gotta be mundane one,
it's the same story.

1239
01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:33.220
And he tells it to you like it's the first time for him.
Yeah,
buddy.

1240
01:23:33.230 --> 01:23:36.290
I got to tell you a story.
I was golfing the other day.
Yeah.

1241
01:23:36.291 --> 01:23:40.010
It's gotta be something real fucking,
yeah.
Yeah.

1242
01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:44.690
I ever tell you about how they,
that's how it usually is.

1243
01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:50.160
Okay.
I went,
I know my friend George was a,
he said his,
uh,

1244
01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:55.940
is that he's at the restaurant and he asked for the ice tea and they brought

1245
01:23:56.451 --> 01:24:00.140
them all a water glaring is paying attention.

1246
01:24:00.770 --> 01:24:04.210
You have to pay attention though.
Fuck.
Are you telling me the story for it?

1247
01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:08.640
But you have to pay attention.
Yeah,
I know.
I'm trying to.
Um,
it's,
it's a good,

1248
01:24:08.641 --> 01:24:13.560
it's,
it's,
it is good.
Uh,
I,
I,
and when you eat cheese,
your beard smells horrible.

1249
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:17.340
Yeah.
Yeah.
It smells like shit.

1250
01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:23.760
Oh my God.
Can we look at this for a second way?
What are you picking?

1251
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.380
I'm going to take a,
I'm going to take his,

1252
01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:35.400
I'm going to take the farts.
The smell.
Yeah.
Cause I get,

1253
01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:38.850
I wouldn't be able to tolerate a month.
I think a day I might kill myself.

1254
01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:43.470
I wouldn't be able to do it,
but I won't kiss you for a year.
I'll be like,
Yo,

1255
01:24:43.471 --> 01:24:46.680
come to kiss me.
I'd be like,
yeah,
but you're,
what you're saying is like,

1256
01:24:47.070 --> 01:24:49.800
would you like some love and affection?
Yeah.
Or to be,

1257
01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:54.880
or to actually think about committing suicide and killing yourself.
I think,
uh,

1258
01:24:55.290 --> 01:24:58.980
uh,
I think I would do that.
I think I would take the lack of affection for,

1259
01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:05.250
for a minute.
You know,
we,

1260
01:25:05.251 --> 01:25:08.520
I cannot believe we haven't addressed this yet.
This is really,

1261
01:25:08.521 --> 01:25:13.430
really worth talking about.
What,
well,
let me pull this up.
Um,

1262
01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:17.940
sure.
Charlotte,
by the way,
I tweeted that I started,

1263
01:25:17.970 --> 01:25:20.400
but it was a false alarm.
I didn't really sharp.

1264
01:25:20.730 --> 01:25:25.000
You didn't really by far farted hard and I was alone.
I was like,
oh look,
I,

1265
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:27.270
I startled a little bit cause I'm like,

1266
01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:32.100
it was too brisk and it felt like there was a pub at the end of it and I just

1267
01:25:32.101 --> 01:25:36.430
pooped later.
But I did not sharp.
Thank you for your concern.
That's what,

1268
01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:37.530
what are you telling me this for?

1269
01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:40.500
I don't know cause I tweeted it and I just felt like it was relevant while

1270
01:25:40.501 --> 01:25:44.730
you're looking for some,
if you go on iTunes.
Yeah.
Jeff Tate,

1271
01:25:44.850 --> 01:25:47.280
friend of the show.
Yes.
Hot dogs and Gatorade.

1272
01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:52.580
He hasn't had a new album come out and I can't get a large image of it

1273
01:25:53.290 --> 01:25:54.123
<v 12>but</v>

1274
01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:58.640
<v 6>oh,
on his album cover command plus.</v>

1275
01:25:59.130 --> 01:25:59.963
<v 12>Okay.</v>

1276
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:04.370
<v 6>I don't know really how to make things bigger dude.</v>

1277
01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:05.660
And

1278
01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:13.030
he did it.
Hot dogs and gator aid.

1279
01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:17.270
It's called Jeff Tate again.
Just one of the best comedians working today.
Okay.

1280
01:26:17.271 --> 01:26:21.890
Jeff.
So funny.
Nominal comic.
And He's put out a number of albums.

1281
01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:27.120
His latest album is called again and it's him and it looks like he's at a

1282
01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:29.550
restaurant or a diner or something.
Right.
Is that where he's at?
It was,

1283
01:26:29.551 --> 01:26:32.690
it looked like to you.
He usually eats in the seven 11 parking lot,
but yeah.
Yeah.

1284
01:26:32.691 --> 01:26:36.320
But he's sitting at a table and he's got hotdogs and Gatorade.

1285
01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:40.490
I love it on the table.
I mean you,
you realize the implications of this.

1286
01:26:40.491 --> 01:26:45.491
This man could have put anything on his album cover and this is a direct tip of

1287
01:26:46.431 --> 01:26:50.750
the hat to your mom's house guys.
So honored.

1288
01:26:50.751 --> 01:26:52.340
Thank you Jeff tape.
Thank you Jeff.
Tape.

1289
01:26:52.341 --> 01:26:57.341
Please go on iTunes or Amazon and get the album is called again.

1290
01:26:59.410 --> 01:27:03.620
He will not disappoint you.
I promise.
He's one of the funniest dudes.

1291
01:27:03.621 --> 01:27:05.700
Great Storyteller.
Uh,

1292
01:27:05.850 --> 01:27:09.780
it's just a hard working awesome comic,
but he's got,

1293
01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:11.690
he's got it hot dogs and Gatorade.

1294
01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:13.190
<v 3>And for those of you don't know the story,</v>

1295
01:27:13.191 --> 01:27:16.980
Jeff Tate lived on our couch for like a week and change.
Yeah.

1296
01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:21.710
And I think he was going through a rough time and he was sleeping on our couch

1297
01:27:21.711 --> 01:27:26.450
and we live next door to a seven 11 and I would cook and offer him meals.

1298
01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:29.090
You know,
he want some dinner.
Nope.
I'm going to get my own thing.

1299
01:27:29.091 --> 01:27:33.350
And then he would come back with two hot dogs and a thing.

1300
01:27:33.351 --> 01:27:37.700
I like blue or red Gatorade and that's all he ate for the entire time he lived

1301
01:27:37.701 --> 01:27:38.534
on our couch.

1302
01:27:38.590 --> 01:27:43.540
<v 6>Yeah,
he was having a bad week.
He was having a bad week.
But that's all he ate.</v>

1303
01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:44.493
But then he is,

1304
01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:48.610
but then we got to tell everybody about how Jeff Tate lives on hot docs and data

1305
01:27:48.650 --> 01:27:52.930
and then he would have like a blue ring around his mouth cause that's,
oh,

1306
01:27:52.931 --> 01:27:57.130
and can you pull that up?
There's a handmade sign.

1307
01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:02.640
Somebody who made this for us one time.
This is for Jeff.
Yeah,

1308
01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:09.790
there it is.
Hotdogs and Gatorade.
So good.
So good.

1309
01:28:11.350 --> 01:28:16.210
I thought was a great ride.
Anyways,
he's so funny.

1310
01:28:16.211 --> 01:28:19.460
Amazing.
And He loves Tom.
Tom Petty,
right?
Isn't that,

1311
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:22.950
yeah.
Uh,

1312
01:28:22.990 --> 01:28:27.010
would you rather finally shit your pants in public once a year or subtly in

1313
01:28:27.011 --> 01:28:31.160
private daily.
Oh,
I mean I almost do every day since my,

1314
01:28:31.290 --> 01:28:35.860
I gave birth,
but come on,
I almost shit my pants constantly now.
Right.

1315
01:28:35.890 --> 01:28:37.540
But this is not about almost doing it.

1316
01:28:37.570 --> 01:28:41.560
This is about doing it privately every day.
Of course I'm here,

1317
01:28:41.561 --> 01:28:44.110
I'm hearing a lot over once a year in public,

1318
01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:46.990
you're talking about every single day you shit your pants.
And

1319
01:28:47.010 --> 01:28:50.270
<v 3>here's why this is psychological warfare.
No,
hear me.
See</v>

1320
01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:57.200
the problem with once a year is it every morning you're going to wake up and go

1321
01:28:57.260 --> 01:29:00.890
is today the day I have to shit my pants and public because of this.
Would you?

1322
01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:02.040
So you're

1323
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:06.240
<v 6>going to live in constant fear of shitting your pants in public and it could be</v>

1324
01:29:06.241 --> 01:29:09.300
an inopportune time.
You're on an airplane.
Yeah.
Think about that.
Yeah,

1325
01:29:09.390 --> 01:29:13.560
you've got four hours on that flight,
but it becomes who you are.
You know,

1326
01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:17.130
it's like the guy that wears a fucking a fedora everywhere.

1327
01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:20.070
That's part of the outfit.
You Shit.
And your once a year,

1328
01:29:20.071 --> 01:29:22.030
you know it's going to be a fucking party.
Okay.

1329
01:29:22.110 --> 01:29:24.150
You're going to have a great story.
Guess what happened today?

1330
01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:28.470
I went to except the congressional medal of honor and as the president and put

1331
01:29:28.471 --> 01:29:32.340
it around my neck.
I Shit my pants.
Yeah.
Why?
Cause I play.
Would you rather?
Yeah.

1332
01:29:32.430 --> 01:29:36.990
Cause I have two roles now.
The psychological torture of it.

1333
01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:40.610
Dude,
I'm taking once a year in public.
You would?
Okay.

1334
01:29:41.230 --> 01:29:42.860
<v 9>Uh,</v>

1335
