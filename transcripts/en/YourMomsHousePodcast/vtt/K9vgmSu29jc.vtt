There's a natural disaster.

<v 0>Anyways.
Um,

45
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:08.860
It's an exciting week for me.
Um,
natural disasters aside because,
uh,

46
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.630
I'm going this week to Montclair,
New Jersey.

47
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:15.580
The welmont both shows are sold out.

48
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.690
I'm doing four shows at the Miriam and Philadelphia.
Uh,

49
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.340
the only show with tickets left and it now it's even more limited is the late

50
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:27.520
show.
Friday,
November 16th,
that's exciting.

51
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:31.150
But also November 16th,
instant family,

52
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:35.620
that movie that I shot earlier this year,
I was gone for awhile.

53
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.530
Um,
it's really a great movie.
It's a family movie.

54
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:42.940
It's not in the theme of your mom's house.
It's not an r rated comedy,

55
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:46.690
but it is a great film.
Sean Andrews directed it.

56
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.240
Stars Mark Walberg and Rose Byrne and a,

57
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.000
yours truly has a fun Hartnett.
Uh,
I've seen it.
I'm going to go see it again.

58
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.910
Um,
even pay attention,
by the way to my Instagram,

59
00:03:57.911 --> 00:04:02.910
I might even do a screening at a theater sometime in the next few weeks.
And,
uh,

60
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.860
I will invite people,
so pay attention to that.

61
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.060
That'll be here in the Los Angeles area,
maybe out in the VI.
Yay.

62
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.820
Um,
but anyways,
I appreciate all your support.
Anybody that goes in seasons,

63
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:17.490
that family,
it,
uh,
it's,

64
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.070
it's very beneficial to me and to the people who made this great movie.

65
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.880
Um,
the tourist stuff,
Thomson [inaudible] dot com slash tour.

66
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.300
You guys know that a,

67
00:04:26.301 --> 00:04:31.180
that tour has been growing and growing and we just added a second show in

68
00:04:31.181 --> 00:04:33.580
Cincinnati hometown coming through for me.

69
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.410
We had this check at the second show at the Aronoff.
Uh,

70
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.290
I think it's center for the arts.
That's February 15th,
that week.

71
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:46.260
I'm also doing two in Pittsburgh too,
in Cleveland and two in d c uh,

72
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.980
you know where to go for those tickets.

73
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.080
square.com/tony or it's very exciting stuff.

74
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.190
<v 3>So the Trans Canada highway,
no,
that's uh,
that's the jest glass and guide.</v>

75
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.740
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
It kind of moves kind of most,
you know,

76
00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:10.000
we are going to have to tell them about the way you said free there.

77
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.160
I think we might have to start doing that all the time.
Was something,

78
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.840
did I do it?
You said is right.

79
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.140
<v 0>Free postage.
I've never heard that.</v>

80
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.750
I could see that being a national jingle

81
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.840
<v 3>boasted whoa.
No,
I'm feeling very well.</v>

82
00:05:24.841 --> 00:05:28.140
I'm feeling freer than feel an existential today.
Okay.

83
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.140
Who knows what's going to happen.
Our lives are not in our control.

84
00:05:31.141 --> 00:05:34.530
It's been a wild ride.
We'll talk.
Let's talk about it.

Let's open the show properly.

88
00:05:47.911 --> 00:05:50.410
but they know something's there.
I don't say that.

89
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.510
That's not my thing to say that one.

99
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.860
<v 0>Is that audio from our,</v>

100
00:06:47.861 --> 00:06:51.880
Anna's asking my way is all this chaos by the way,

101
00:06:51.881 --> 00:06:53.290
started on our anniversary.

102
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.840
And can I tell you we've had the worst anniversary luck.

103
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.590
So two anniversaries ago,
we woke up to find that Donald Trump was our leader.

104
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.980
That was to you two anniversaries.
You got it.
Yeah.
Now this one,

105
00:07:02.981 --> 00:07:07.780
we wake up to the world is on fire.
It was fucked up.
We had a very special,

106
00:07:07.781 --> 00:07:11.280
okay,
so I plan this,
uh,
it was like,
oh,
we're going to do some real switch.

107
00:07:11.281 --> 00:07:14.140
Our 10 year anniversary,
do something really special.

108
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:19.090
So I plan just one night because we have babies.
You know,
we have young,

109
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.960
young kid.
He can't be away for long.
No,
I played one night,

110
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.490
very special place.
I'm always going to be great evenings,
just you and I.

111
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.560
And we went up to napa to a wine country,
to nappy headed,

112
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.000
uh,
wine country.
And while we're up there,

113
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.990
it's like we check in.
I'm like,
what is that?
And they're like,
that's ash.

114
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.580
I'm like,
Ash.
You're like,
yeah,
there's a big fire up in Butte county.

115
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.090
Okay,
okay.
Bud County,
California.

116
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:54.610
So we had a,
okay.
We're like,
is that a threat here?

117
00:07:54.611 --> 00:07:57.910
Like not really.
It's 200 miles from here.
They tell you sooner,
miles.

118
00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.470
Then all of a sudden later,
they're like,
hey,

119
00:07:59.471 --> 00:08:03.880
that fire is spreading a 800 800 yards a minute.
It's growing.
I was like,

120
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:08.350
that's pretty fast.
800 yards a minute.
So anyway,

121
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:12.910
as that's happening,
we're up there.
We're still enjoying ourselves,
but they're,

122
00:08:12.911 --> 00:08:15.640
you know,
you can't really sit outside.

123
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:19.300
There's ash raining down and it was threatened.
I mean like it smelled.

124
00:08:19.301 --> 00:08:22.630
You could see that.
Um,
what would be a clear view is actually like this,

125
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.300
remember we were like,
why is it hazy?
Like,
oh that smoke from the fire.

126
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.340
So that shit's happening.
And then we go,

127
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:34.750
um,
we're hanging out and then we get word that,
oh,

128
00:08:34.751 --> 00:08:38.020
there's a fire in southern California.
Oh,
cool.
What's that?

129
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:40.300
A year ago there was the big,

130
00:08:40.301 --> 00:08:42.790
the Thomas Fire and a couple of those in the La area.

131
00:08:42.791 --> 00:08:47.170
Remember when like the near the Getty was on fire,
it was on fire.
Yeah.

132
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.490
So now me valley was on fire last year.
That's right.
And those were big fires.

133
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:56.180
Now this one is like unprecedented the way that it spread and

134
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.710
<v 3>the perfect conditions for fire,
you know,</v>

135
00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:03.510
because you have a like a,
what is it,
zero.
Yeah.
Zero humidity.

136
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:07.080
So Super Dry,
big Santa Ana winds,

137
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:12.360
gusts of up to 65 miles an hour sometimes.
And Yeah,

138
00:09:12.361 --> 00:09:15.920
just very dry conditions and a lot of brush.
Yeah,

139
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:21.060
just fire everywhere man.
And usually,

140
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:24.300
I mean those poor people that are in that,
in the Malibu area,

141
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:26.430
they always get it and it got it again.

142
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:31.760
But this time it started to spread further south and east,

143
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.030
which threatens where we live as well.

144
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:40.920
So I'm sure if you follow social media,
you saw rogue and got evacuated.

145
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:46.350
He lives,
uh,
west of us.
But,
um,
yeah,
so we,
we had to,

146
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.920
you know,
they're telling us we don't have like a,
we're not at the mandatory yet,

147
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:52.590
but we also,
you know,
we have kids,
we have,

148
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:56.610
we have dogs and you could see like the smoke has grown,

149
00:09:56.611 --> 00:10:00.870
you smell it outside now
the town

150
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.630
has been since last night,
so we're next on the call sheet.
Yeah.

151
00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:11.550
So it just makes sense.
I think it's the,
it's so smoky and I don't,

152
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.600
I just don't want to get that panic.
Like where they're like,
go,
go,
go,
go,
go.

153
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.530
That's apparently what's happening is by the time they're telling you to leave,

154
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:23.310
it's like,
yeah,
you don't have the time to collect your druthers.

155
00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:26.670
And I dunno,
I'd tell you it's a,

156
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.460
it's really cry again,

157
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.530
it's very emotional for me to see these fires cause I grew up here and I've seen

158
00:10:34.531 --> 00:10:38.580
Malibu burned down like how many times.
It's an unbelievable,

159
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.870
but to see the valley kind of get it where I just,
I can't,

160
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:45.960
it's so hard for me to even see it.
Yeah.
I hate it.

161
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:51.180
It's terrible and scary too because you know,
whatever,
it's scary.

162
00:10:51.181 --> 00:10:53.370
It's very scary.
I know you,
you start seeing,

163
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:58.170
I mean fire is always scary and you see these big fires and they're showing last

164
00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:02.850
night we're just seeing like all these homes just completely collapse and cars

165
00:11:02.851 --> 00:11:05.130
on fire and they're like,
oh these people died in their car.

166
00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:09.930
It's just horrible stuff.
I know.
And it makes you think like,
well,

167
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.740
you know,
it's,

168
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.570
it's obviously possible that it could come over to our area.

169
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:20.780
And so we,
uh,
we're close baby.
We're like,
it's,

170
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.210
it's like three streets down dude.

171
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.870
That's not three streets down three major streets.
Yeah.
Literally.
No,

172
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.710
literally and,
and that's another thing I,

173
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:32.040
cause because I grew up on these mean streets,
I'm like,
oh my God,

174
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.260
there's a fire there.
I know that neighborhood.

175
00:11:34.261 --> 00:11:38.490
That's where my best friend's family is.
And Yeah.
So anyway,

176
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:40.560
we're getting the fuck out of here.
But we thought,

177
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.530
well there's still time cause we don't know when we can come back to her house.

178
00:11:43.531 --> 00:11:48.210
Yeah.
Just to do this.
And I know in a horrible scenario,
I thought about it too.

179
00:11:48.211 --> 00:11:52.440
It's like this,
a studio could be gone.
Could,
yeah.

180
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.920
Could be highly possible.
And you know,

181
00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:02.440
we're packing the essentials.
We've got our lubricants,
we got Dildos,

182
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:07.300
dildos.
Uh,
we got the fisting thing of the cuffs.

183
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.570
Flashlights.
Yeah.
Toilet paper.

184
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.370
Like all the real family important stuff.
Well,

185
00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:18.460
I will tell you that when I saw Joe had evacuated,
I was like,
Oh shit.

186
00:12:18.461 --> 00:12:21.820
Like we were still in Napa Valley and he was with marshal at a studio.

187
00:12:21.821 --> 00:12:26.620
And I'm like,
Oh wow,
okay.
Cause he's our,
he's,
yeah.
Further west.

188
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:31.800
And I'm like,
that means that Jesus Christ that's coming our direction.
Um,

189
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.600
it's very scary.
And that,
and so by the time we landed,

190
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.880
we saw the fires from the airplane that we were in and it was just chaos.

191
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:40.661
It's chaos.

192
00:12:40.661 --> 00:12:43.840
And I think what scares me the most is that it's not contained at all.

193
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.760
It's a zero,
not like 10% containment.
And usually the fire department,

194
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.820
they draw a line and,
and the fire doesn't cross that line.

195
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.780
But because there's no line right now,
that's the part that I'm like,

196
00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.970
time to go.
The other thing and people no containment,
don't know about.
Um,

197
00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:05.200
so today,
like overnight Friday going into Saturday,

198
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.390
the winds died.
The winds are the worst thing for the fire.

199
00:13:08.391 --> 00:13:13.360
This is why it's a catastrophe and it starts a new,
so it died,

200
00:13:13.361 --> 00:13:17.470
the winds died and they got like some work done and put out some,
you know,

201
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:21.130
very little containment.
Then they're like,
oh,

202
00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.950
going into Sunday we're going to get Santa Ana's again,

203
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.020
going to pick up and who knows what'll happen.

204
00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:28.780
Well and the Santa Ana's are going to blow it directly towards us.

205
00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.610
That's the real kicker.

206
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.860
And what's really mortifying is that there's not enough help because of the

207
00:13:35.861 --> 00:13:40.630
northern California fires.
We don't have as many resources down here.

208
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.540
So that's what's happening too,
is like when we were flying in,
I'm like,

209
00:13:43.541 --> 00:13:46.120
where the fuck are the helicopters dumping water?

210
00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.840
Not to say that there aren't firefighters giving their lives to,
they are.

211
00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:53.890
They are.
But I'm saying that usually,
I mean,
when Bel Air was on fire,
you,

212
00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.580
you saw them just dumping,
dumping dumpy.
I'm like,
well where,

213
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:57.670
where are these people?

214
00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:01.480
And so they're bringing crews and from Arizona now to help us fight this fire

215
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:05.670
because it's 0% contained.
You know,
those guys are amazing.
The first response,

216
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:09.370
my God,
I mean,
look,
I'm not shitting on you guys.

217
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.410
Anybody that's helping us fight the fire.

218
00:14:11.411 --> 00:14:14.720
I'm just saying that it does seem like there's way less out there.
Well,

219
00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:18.640
I think it seems like less because of how enormous this House,
oh my God,

220
00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:23.590
I saw that thing today where they said there's 900 firefighters,

221
00:14:23.591 --> 00:14:25.660
which you know,
I don't know what that sounds like to you.

222
00:14:25.661 --> 00:14:30.130
That doesn't sound like,
yeah,
when you talk about the scope of this thing,

223
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.980
it's really big one in Pepperdine.

224
00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:37.980
All those students that are in there and the quote fireproofed who knows fire

225
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.870
right now is burned a 70,000 acres here.
It's not,

226
00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:45.900
this is going to be higher by the time it comes out.
It is nuts.

227
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.810
It is nuts.
I Dunno.
I,
you know,
again,

228
00:14:49.811 --> 00:14:52.550
I've seen a lot of shit go down in this part of La.

229
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:57.050
I saw the 1994 we had an earthquake that just took down the San Fernando valley,

230
00:14:57.051 --> 00:14:59.290
but I feel like this is on par.

231
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:03.330
This is another key major disaster upon us.
It's really scary.

232
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:08.210
We,
um,
anyways,
I was jerking off or

233
00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:15.500
beautiful there in the afternoon.
We did make marital love.

234
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.433
Does any APP,

235
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.240
that's me.
I recorded myself.

236
00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:30.620
Holy War on Ethan and Ilos podcast age three.

237
00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.760
And you made it sound like we hadn't done it in,
I was backed up though.

238
00:15:34.761 --> 00:15:36.080
It wasn't,
I backed up.
Yeah,

239
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:40.330
I remember you gave me a nut check before you were like,
you are backed up.
Well,

240
00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.480
a lot of people don't know that.
I,

241
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:46.130
I can tell exactly when was the last time you're not swear evacuated and they

242
00:15:46.131 --> 00:15:48.410
were evacuated big time on that trip.

243
00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:49.323
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

244
00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:54.870
<v 3>Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Everything came out.</v>

245
00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:59.400
I can touch them and just see that they're full or they're hard.

246
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.680
Why?
They're low and loose.
That's they're low.

247
00:16:04.681 --> 00:16:08.670
I know that they've been milked and they're kind of lower and softer.

248
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.360
Yeah,
they're relaxed.
That's empty.

249
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:18.200
And if they're a top higher and they're kind of full and heavy,
then odd.

250
00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:21.500
But that's funny that they're heavy in their higher,
I don't know why you're,

251
00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:25.500
that's what you're nuts.
Do you,
you're like kind of a nut expert.
I'm a Tom.

252
00:16:25.501 --> 00:16:30.270
None expert.
I W I wouldn't say I'm an all.
We say you're the ball queen.

253
00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:36.710
And what's her name?
The ball hot.
Uh,
Peyton Lafferty.
Lafferty.
Yeah,

254
00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:37.613
I think it was Peyton.

255
00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.163
<v 7>Hi</v>

256
00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.090
Peyton Lafferty.
Oh Huh.

257
00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:49.600
<v 3>Yeah,

Yup.</v>

258
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.180
<v 7>Paul Sullivan.
That calm.</v>

259
00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.390
<v 3>That didn't even make sense.</v>

260
00:16:57.391 --> 00:17:01.920
I know she said to rub your balls all over that come what she likes.

261
00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:06.870
That is not what she was saying.
She likes.
She likes it.

262
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:08.310
Nobody likes that.

263
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:09.730
<v 7>No.</v>

264
00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:17.280
<v 3>Yeah.
Rose well does balls all over those tits.
That's tats.</v>

265
00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:21.450
That's hot tap.
Everybody likes that.
T e t.
S

266
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:29.610
it's fucking hot.
It feels manufacturer.
It feels normal and sexy to me.

267
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:34.440
Very sexy.
Sexy.
How about this guy on the train though?

268
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.220
We watched him for a minute.
What cities is this?
Um,

269
00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:41.270
I'm saying I'm going with east coast.
Well,
diesels.

270
00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.373
<v 5>Good Shit.</v>

271
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:56.490
Blood on the Schrader

272
00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:01.720
for train the trains with me.

273
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.410
I'm selling blood,

274
00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:10.420
<v 3>he's fucked up,
but he's also,
he's,
this is smart advertising.</v>

275
00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:14.320
This is how somebody takes advantage of an opportunity.

276
00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:18.610
You have potential customers all around you.
You have a voice that works.

277
00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.530
Might as well announced that if you're looking for weed,

278
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.910
you get on the four train and all summer I'm going to be here selling it.

279
00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.000
It's word of mouth.
Yeah.
It's like,
well,

280
00:18:28.001 --> 00:18:30.940
I mean look weed's not that big of a deal anymore to most people,

281
00:18:30.941 --> 00:18:34.270
but you're still sometimes looking like where to get it and if I'm on this train

282
00:18:34.271 --> 00:18:36.850
I'm like,
oh,
I just hop on the four train.
This guy's going to be selling weed.

283
00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:37.150
Well,

284
00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:42.070
I'd say the benefit to his salesman ship is that you're on the train.

285
00:18:42.071 --> 00:18:45.250
Maybe it's a nice time saver to have a two for one.
Absolutely.

286
00:18:45.251 --> 00:18:49.270
Buy Our coffee and then I took the four train five days a week.

287
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.340
I'll just look for this guy.
Yeah.
Where is that?

288
00:18:51.341 --> 00:18:53.570
Where's the drunk guy in the jacket?
Right.

289
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:57.190
And the two or five jackets and he's wearing,
where's the drug?

290
00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:02.520
Five jacket guy with that loud ass fucking purple Derp will that he was

291
00:19:03.501 --> 00:19:07.450
uploading sour diesel he's wearing wait one,
two,
three,

292
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:12.430
four jackets like jacket,
check,
check,
check,
check.
Yeah,
it's good.

293
00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:16.180
It's a lot of jackets,
but it's probably to hide all that weed.
Yeah.

294
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.223
<v 5>Wow.</v>

295
00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.310
<v 3>What the wife died.
Her name was on the least,</v>

296
00:19:31.311 --> 00:19:34.220
not his and that's why I'm homeless.
Oh.
So he's really like,

297
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:38.030
he's basically saying I'm not.
I'm homeless by circumstance.

298
00:19:38.031 --> 00:19:43.010
It's kind of not really.
Look ladies,
I don't judge hard live with my mom.

299
00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:43.873
Yeah.

300
00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:49.330
I live here on the fourth time capable of monogamy kind of guy who was the

301
00:19:49.461 --> 00:19:52.250
marrying kind.
I also have five jackets.
If you're cold,

302
00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.330
you think he'd share his jacket with me?
Absolutely.

303
00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:02.330
<v 5>[inaudible] he's got to memorize.</v>

304
00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.120
<v 3>That's cool.
That's a lot of time on the train.
Yeah.</v>

305
00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:20.300
That is one thing I do miss living in Los Angeles.

306
00:20:20.301 --> 00:20:25.120
This is like public transit.
That's not the thing here.
It's not,

307
00:20:25.121 --> 00:20:28.270
but it should be because I feel like we have so many crazy people that could

308
00:20:28.271 --> 00:20:33.010
really shine.
People watching.
I know like every time I go to New York,

309
00:20:33.011 --> 00:20:36.130
I just love the subway situation.

310
00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:38.080
So experience that's part is a,

311
00:20:38.081 --> 00:20:42.250
nobody makes eye contact and people like we'll eat on the bus,
the subway,

312
00:20:42.251 --> 00:20:43.780
which is so disgusting to me.

313
00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.590
There's always a little threat of danger always.

314
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.480
That's what makes it more exciting.
Yeah.

315
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.240
Well there's always somebody fighting or starting a fight,

316
00:20:52.241 --> 00:20:53.320
but you're not allowed to look,

317
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.610
which is really annoying because if you look then you could get involved.

318
00:20:57.611 --> 00:20:59.980
You know,
you always have this thing where you get to,

319
00:20:59.981 --> 00:21:01.780
people watch and you can go.

320
00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:04.960
Sometimes people give you the signal like it's okay to watch me.

321
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:06.670
You know what I mean?
They'll,
they'll have a look to them,

322
00:21:06.671 --> 00:21:09.160
but like I know I'm fucking weird and then you could watch me.

323
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:12.280
They know they know what they're doing and they put it out there like I'm not a

324
00:21:12.281 --> 00:21:12.970
threat.

325
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:16.810
And then there's people who you think are no threat whatsoever and they fucking,

326
00:21:16.811 --> 00:21:19.480
we'll flex on you and you're like,
oh shit,
don't look at that guy.

327
00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:24.220
I had to go down to the La county clerk last week to pick up our child's birth

328
00:21:24.221 --> 00:21:27.250
certificate.
That kind of office is it's Yo,

329
00:21:27.251 --> 00:21:29.980
that's one where you look at a rar.
Subway,

330
00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:33.551
put it this way.

331
00:21:33.551 --> 00:21:38.200
I got a bag of Takis and a bottle of water before I wanted to stand in line

332
00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.330
cause I was like Oh shit it's going to be on.

333
00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:44.440
And Lo and behold it was on some shit cause you got people getting married.

334
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:48.850
You got people getting death certificates.
Birth certificates was baby daddies.

335
00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.280
You know what I'm saying?
I saw like,
you know,

336
00:21:51.281 --> 00:21:54.540
15 year old girls with babies getting the birth certificate.

337
00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.310
I saw some real rough look in people.
Yeah,

338
00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:00.330
there's a lot of scary mother goddesses.

339
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:05.160
Birth and death that United State money that is um,
like an even playing field.

340
00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:08.100
It brings in all kinds.

341
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:11.470
You know what I was thinking though is like what do super famous people do?

342
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:13.050
Like I thought that too.

343
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:17.700
Like you have to go to the DMV if you're a fucking Mariah Carey or whoever or

344
00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:22.640
cost.
Can you send someone?
Well like it's an official document.
I know.

345
00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:27.100
Let's say it goes down because it's in Oklahoma and it was probably like,

346
00:22:27.101 --> 00:22:29.160
he's probably like,
Hey,

347
00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:32.170
I'm g and everyone goes nuts and they probably come out and they're like,

348
00:22:32.171 --> 00:22:33.700
we realize this is an inconvenience for you,

349
00:22:33.701 --> 00:22:37.800
so we already prepped everything for you.
And he's like,
Oh shucks,
did you?
Yeah,

350
00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.450
I just like you.
And they're like,
I know you are.
Here's your thing,

351
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.020
just sign here.
I can't imagine.
Yeah,

352
00:22:44.021 --> 00:22:47.770
like famous people Hashtag thank y'all very much.

353
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:54.240
Like you have to get a death certificate of birds are getting [inaudible].

354
00:22:54.241 --> 00:22:57.880
I felt like this Brad Pitt just fucking show up places and he's like,
Hey,

355
00:22:57.881 --> 00:22:59.830
do I need to sign?
I'm in line.

356
00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:05.380
Brad Pitt has to do with the eye exam at the DMV or get his driver's license

357
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:09.250
renewals wouldn't.
How do you get around the eye exam?

358
00:23:09.251 --> 00:23:13.390
Love an answer on this.
I know.
So many levels to fame.

359
00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:18.640
Like I remember I did jury duty a few years ago and Adam McKay was behind me and

360
00:23:18.641 --> 00:23:23.410
I was like,
Oh shit.
But he's also like this very progressive,

361
00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:28.240
you know,
I could see him being like,
this is my,
my civic duty.
And he's also,

362
00:23:28.241 --> 00:23:28.901
he's famous,

363
00:23:28.901 --> 00:23:31.810
but he's not famous in the way that like people are going to swarm him.
Well,

364
00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:35.900
I don't know what he looks like.
I knew it was now,
but you know him.

365
00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:39.550
So he's the writer director.
He did everything from anchorman two.

366
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:43.350
He just did that new,
that new one that's going to come out,
uh,

367
00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:45.800
with about Vice President Cheney

368
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:51.380
<v 0>where I showed you the trailer where it's fucking Christian Bale.
God,</v>

369
00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:56.480
it looks amazing.
And he did that one about the,
you know,
the stock market,
the,

370
00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:00.350
what does it,
long story short,
was it called,
you know what I mean?
With uh,

371
00:24:00.351 --> 00:24:03.850
Steve Carrell also had Christian Bale.
It was about like,
uh,

372
00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:08.360
the collapse in Oh eight.
Anyways,
he's a great writer,
director,
but of course,

373
00:24:08.361 --> 00:24:12.470
like he's not somebody who everyone's going to recognize right away.
Um,
but yeah,

374
00:24:12.471 --> 00:24:17.270
I was thinking like,
would deniro be behind me like jury duty today?
I mean,

375
00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.780
technically he supposed to,
well,
right.
Yeah.

376
00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:24.430
Like everybody gets called in for that shit and being like,
just doing my duty.

377
00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.530
But it doesn't exclude you from being a civilian.
But then again,

378
00:24:27.531 --> 00:24:32.320
Taylor swift showed up to take,
that was on the news.
She went to swift.
Oh yeah.

379
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:35.450
She,
she went to the dorm all now,
from what I understand also like,
I mean,

380
00:24:35.451 --> 00:24:38.690
jury duty was fucking chaos when she was there,
you know?

381
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:43.420
<v 3>Oh,
hold on.
I just got sat an update from,
uh,</v>

382
00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:47.630
Kelly who's about five minutes from us.
There's an updated map,

383
00:24:47.631 --> 00:24:51.690
but disaster map and I don't know,
let's see.
Yeah,

384
00:24:51.691 --> 00:24:56.480
it looks like we're getting into Canoga Park.
Yeah.
Okay.
It is,

385
00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:01.430
yeah.
It's spreading to Canoga.
Yeah,
it's not good.
It's not good.

386
00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:06.380
Yeah.
There's an incident map.
Yeah.
Look,
it's coming towards us now.

387
00:25:06.381 --> 00:25:11.381
It's getting closer to Mulholland Ghibli.

388
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:17.770
So my friend who lives like five minutes west of us is kind of giving us

389
00:25:18.471 --> 00:25:22.700
updates.
She's closer to the fire than we are.
It's coming around the mountain,

390
00:25:22.701 --> 00:25:23.534
man.

391
00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:25.283
<v 8>Come on.</v>

394
00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:41.350
<v 3>it's just devastating.

It's so surreal.
I mean,</v>

395
00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:43.330
this is a disaster.

396
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:49.370
<v 0>It's pretty wild,

What are we talking about?
Oh,
famous people.
Uh,
yeah.</v>

397
00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:53.090
How the fuck,
okay.
If anybody has any insight on that,

398
00:25:53.091 --> 00:25:57.740
like how do the mega famous people of the world do average people things like

399
00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:01.250
how do they,
how do they get away with it if they're like,
I can't,

400
00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:05.150
like how do they get away with it?
Who Do they tell these two falls to go down?

401
00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:09.050
And especially like,
you know,
with jury duty,
if Taylor swift can go,

402
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:10.560
you're fucking,
that's right.
You know,

<v 3>that's right.
Okay.

414
00:26:56.951 --> 00:26:59.410
but that's still the same area.
That is still the same area.

415
00:26:59.411 --> 00:27:01.700
That's the same exit there.
Oh,
okay.
This is the same area.

416
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.030
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

417
00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:08.350
<v 3>Yeah.
Shit man.
Chatsworth is getting fucked too.</v>

418
00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:11.500
I felt Roscoe there.
Eva.

419
00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:14.190
No good dude's no goods.

420
00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:16.453
<v 9>Hmm.</v>

421
00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.530
<v 3>Yeah.
Here's the,
here's the thing.</v>

422
00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:22.740
It is just so sad.
I mean,
look,

423
00:27:22.741 --> 00:27:25.900
we're fortunate that we have a plan where,
note,

424
00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:27.930
we know where we're going to go here in a few hours,

425
00:27:27.931 --> 00:27:30.960
but there are some people that probably don't have,
you know,

426
00:27:30.961 --> 00:27:33.210
family or friends or somewhere to go and

427
00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.740
my heart just goes out to them.
So how it was so horrible.

428
00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:41.220
I just thought they can contain it.
It's just not happening though.

429
00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:45.480
I know the f and the winds are going to kick up tomorrow.
It's no good.

430
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:48.270
I wish this guy,
we're here to sell this weed right now.

431
00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:50.580
<v 9>Okay.</v>

432
00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:54.460
<v 3>It would be really helpful actually,
which we could get fucking ripped.</v>

433
00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:57.640
Let's go after this.
We're going to go and we're going to get ripped.

434
00:27:57.641 --> 00:28:00.370
We're going to settle in and get ripped.
That's what it's all about.

435
00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:04.750
Natural disaster situations,
you know.
Getting housed.

436
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:10.140
Actually,
there was this woman on the news last night.
Um,

437
00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:11.650
it's a very fucked up story.

438
00:28:11.651 --> 00:28:16.651
She and her husband were in Westlake village and they evacuated and they came

439
00:28:17.051 --> 00:28:20.350
back and their house was destroyed and he was like,
you know,

440
00:28:20.351 --> 00:28:23.830
I'm just thankful that we're,
uh,
everything we're okay.

441
00:28:23.831 --> 00:28:26.290
Everything with a heartbeat is okay right now.
And the wife,

442
00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:31.660
her lips were totally purple.
Her teeth were totally purple.
She's like,
yeah,

443
00:28:31.661 --> 00:28:36.550
I grew up in Poland and I flat a lot of stuff,
just that house.

444
00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:41.800
She's like,
it's okay.
I'm like,
you poor woman.
You know,

445
00:28:41.801 --> 00:28:45.550
she just started drinking.
The minute she felt safe.
I'm like,
girl,
I'm a dude.

446
00:28:45.551 --> 00:28:50.320
I shit tonight.
You're going to see my ass drunk tonight.
I'll be there too.

447
00:28:50.321 --> 00:28:54.490
I'll be,
oh my shit.
Can I have my coffee back?

448
00:28:54.491 --> 00:28:55.920
Please kind of stole that.

449
00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:03.850
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

450
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:12.090
<v 3>he's single.
Yeah.
How many thought he was gay?
He said he was,</v>

451
00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:15.040
nobody thought he was gay.
No,
I thought it was good.
He said he was married to a,

452
00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:18.390
was just making sure that his single announcement was received by the,

453
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.880
I don't know why he's so threatened by all these gay men.

454
00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:36.523
<v 9>Hmm.</v>

455
00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:38.340
<v 5>Like fish</v>

456
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.150
ass bitch

457
00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:48.680
<v 0>does she,
she's not amused right over here.
No,
she is a music.</v>

458
00:29:48.681 --> 00:29:52.650
She's a holding it.
So yeah,
she likes to Shit's funny as fuck.
I don't know.

459
00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:57.670
Get a dish do you think?
I don't think she's,
she's holding,
she's like,

460
00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:03.650
she's like damn.
She was like,
I prefer cleaner comedy.
Your dish.

461
00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:15.993
Oh man,

462
00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:20.180
<v 5>that shit is fucking good.</v>

463
00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:27.890
Pray
every Sunday night.

464
00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:30.630
<v 0>That true.
That's not true.
No,</v>

465
00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.480
it's not about that party is lying.

466
00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:35.610
The other stuff he might be telling the truth about,

467
00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.300
I think he's selling weed on the four train.
I think his wife died.

468
00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.100
Um,
I think he wants you to wash your ass.

469
00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:46.800
I don't think he wants you to have a sneaky box,

470
00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:51.810
but I don't think he has three sons every Saturday.
Run for president.

471
00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:57.060
Could be.
It's got a lot of good points.
He does have a lot of good point.

472
00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:05.803
<v 5>Ooh.</v>

473
00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:18.140
<v 0>Remember when you are a kid though and you see like a crazy drunk guy,</v>

474
00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:20.690
it really fucks with you.
If you see a guy like that.

475
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:27.190
I remember vividly we were visiting Chicago and we went to church because we

476
00:31:27.741 --> 00:31:32.420
always had to go to church and we're leaving church and this is like in the city

477
00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:37.450
and somewhere downtown Chicago we're leaving and there was a crazy lady on the

478
00:31:37.881 --> 00:31:41.390
corner and I'm a young,
I mean I'm nine or 10 and she goes,

479
00:31:41.391 --> 00:31:45.830
had Darya had dare you,
drank his fucking blood.

480
00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:50.360
And I was like,
whoa.
I was just like holding on to my dad and I was like,
Oh shit.

481
00:31:50.361 --> 00:31:55.361
Because I didn't have a concept of that's a mentally sick or highly inebriated.

482
00:31:56.421 --> 00:31:59.460
You don't know what that is.
You just know that that woman said some crazy.
Yeah.

483
00:31:59.461 --> 00:32:03.680
And I'm like,
why?
She's saying that?
And he was so calm.
He was like,
oh,

484
00:32:03.681 --> 00:32:07.920
she's a,
she's not,
she's not doing well.
It's not like,

485
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:10.970
I don't remember exactly.
I remember he put me at ease.

486
00:32:10.971 --> 00:32:12.980
I mean he didn't really explain it to me.

487
00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:17.700
Of course parents really like explain this to the mentally sick.

488
00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:21.140
He was just like,
don't listen to her.
She's a,
doesn't know what she's saying.

489
00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:24.200
It's that kind of thing.
Just dismissive of it.
And I was like,

490
00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:28.940
but why is she saying that?
Cause she was saying such crazy stuff,
you know,

491
00:32:28.941 --> 00:32:32.990
and she's yelling at people leaving the church.
And I was like yelling at us.

492
00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.650
I remember my mother and I,
when we lived in this horrible,

493
00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:39.990
it's like scary apartment complex.
I say scary because

494
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:43.910
<v 3>there was a drunk woman that lived drunk is scary to children.</v>

495
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:48.920
And One night it was our bedroom windows and there was like a little alley and

496
00:32:48.921 --> 00:32:50.570
then the other apartment complex.

497
00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:55.670
So this woman would get hammered and then drop shit into her toilet.

498
00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.340
And I remember,
she's like,
yeah,

499
00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:59.690
<v 2>ah,
eh.</v>

500
00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:02.070
<v 3>Just out of her mind.</v>

501
00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:06.090
And My mother in the middle of the night drags me with her to confront,

502
00:33:06.091 --> 00:33:10.550
this is so stupid drunk woman.
And she goes,
I dragged my,

503
00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:15.500
rang him up soil latch.
I can't get it out.

504
00:33:15.501 --> 00:33:16.770
Like she was so hammered.

505
00:33:16.771 --> 00:33:20.580
And I remember as a little girl being terrified that we'd confronted this crazy

506
00:33:20.581 --> 00:33:22.540
person.
What'd your mom say to her?
She's like,

507
00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.100
you should shut the fuck up because you,
you're scanning my daughter.

508
00:33:26.101 --> 00:33:28.200
You're scaring us.
Close your window.

509
00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.370
Because she left her window open and that's why it was summertime.

510
00:33:32.371 --> 00:33:36.150
So our window is up because my mother would never pay for air conditioning and

511
00:33:36.151 --> 00:33:39.780
her window was open and everybody could hear her.
She said she told her,

512
00:33:39.781 --> 00:33:40.840
shut up everyone.

513
00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:44.850
Fuck everyone who doesn't run a C and opens windows.

514
00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:46.770
That's money well spent dude.

515
00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:51.630
And it's dangerous to keep your window open at night in a big city in the

516
00:33:51.631 --> 00:33:55.380
summertime.
It's a stupid every fat guy listening,
nodding right now.

517
00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:59.310
Fuck them.
My parents were both super cheap,

518
00:33:59.311 --> 00:34:04.110
so no heat in the winter during our nighttime sleeping and then no cool.

519
00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:09.090
Remember to this irrational fixation with numbers.
Like we would run the AC,

520
00:34:09.091 --> 00:34:10.380
but I remember my dad would be like,

521
00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:16.380
put it to 73 and be like,
wait,
that's not cool enough.

522
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:20.460
It's feels good to me.
And he'd be like,
it's a good temperature.

523
00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:25.650
You know,
if you went below that,
he'd be like,
why are you adjusting it?

524
00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:28.890
It's fucking hot outside.
Let it be cool in here.
Such like,
uh,

525
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:32.040
what's gotta be that number?
No,
it's gotta be cool.
See,

526
00:34:32.041 --> 00:34:37.020
I disagree with your cooling theory and your cooling philosophy has garbage.

527
00:34:37.021 --> 00:34:40.650
Here's why.
What ends up happening is because people like you,

528
00:34:40.651 --> 00:34:44.680
it's the same people that overcompensate for the heater indoors in the winter

529
00:34:44.681 --> 00:34:48.270
time.
If you over cool the house in the summer,
then it's too cold.

530
00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.610
Now I have to go put on a sweater.
No such thing.

531
00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.560
It's like being wintertime and those such things.

532
00:34:52.561 --> 00:34:55.830
There's no such thing as too cool in the,
in the dead of summer.

533
00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.240
It makes me feel sick.

534
00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:01.860
I have to sleep under the down comforter when defends 105 outside.

535
00:35:01.861 --> 00:35:03.660
I want it to feel like a meat locker and said,

536
00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.960
I want my house to feel 74 all the time.

537
00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:11.550
I got to,
I got to meet somebody else.
I can't do this.

538
00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:17.850
That's the deal breaker.
It really,
it's up there.

539
00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:20.220
It's at the top of the list.

540
00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:25.800
I actually 75 feels perlick effect.
I'm going to start playing more vomit clip.

541
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:31.560
We'll stop,
stop saying nonsense.
Then even in the,
even in the dead of summer,

542
00:35:31.561 --> 00:35:34.080
I like it.
I don't like it so cold cause like then it's,

543
00:35:34.081 --> 00:35:36.930
then you're all fucked up.
It's all hot and then you come in and it's,

544
00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.310
it doesn't feel good.

545
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.280
<v 0>All right.
I can't stand you,
but listen,
it's like you're sick.
I can't stand you.</v>

546
00:35:41.281 --> 00:35:45.690
I'm just,
so when I was in,
uh,
Florida a few weeks ago,

547
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:47.310
sometimes it happens.

548
00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:52.311
That shows where you finish a show and as you're saying a thank you,

549
00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:55.260
good night to the audience,
someone in the front row,

550
00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:00.510
we'll try to hand you something.
Yeah.
You know,
so and you know,
usually are like,

551
00:36:00.511 --> 00:36:04.620
what is,
cause it's kind of a crazy rush of them happening.

552
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:06.090
Like you're saying goodbye.

553
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.880
People are applauding your walking offstage and was like,

554
00:36:08.881 --> 00:36:12.030
let me give this to you.
And a lot of times it'll be,
I dunno,

555
00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:15.000
sometimes it's something someone drew.
Uh,

556
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:17.700
sometimes it's like food or something.
You know,

557
00:36:17.701 --> 00:36:20.310
sometimes you look at somebody like,
I can't,
what am I supposed to do with this?

558
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:24.390
It's just shit that's,
you know,
it's hard to say whether it's something you want.

559
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:27.510
Right.
Um,
anyways,

560
00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:32.940
the other day that show ended and this guy has something and I'm like,
okay.

561
00:36:32.941 --> 00:36:33.780
And I reached forward.

562
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:39.500
This guy handed me a DVD copy of riding the bus with my sister.

563
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:44.220
Oh yeah.
That is that movie that he got so excited about.

564
00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:49.590
Um,
the one we are packing for our escape here.
Yeah.

565
00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.010
And you were like,
I have to take this and you brought the deer.

566
00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:56.280
Like you don't have to take that.
And I was like,
it's pretty important.
Um,

567
00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:01.490
it does feel if I'm being honest,
it does feel pretty,
pretty important.
Um,

568
00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:04.500
that's,
can we watch it?
We don't have a DVD player.
Dewey,

569
00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:09.830
I don't know the hotel might do that would make life so worth living as it not

570
00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:12.240
on iTunes.
This ridiculous.
Phil,
let's see.

571
00:37:12.241 --> 00:37:15.180
That's in the fourth seven one drops.

572
00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:20.970
I said not here.
I hear Rosie O'donnell playing a slow adult.

573
00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:25.980
Yeah.
What year is this?
Shit,
man.
I think this came in.

574
00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:31.170
Oh,
it was a while ago for sure.
And DVD.
Yeah,
it's 2005.

575
00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.180
Um,
anyway,
somebody,

576
00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:38.100
<v 10>Joe is beautiful and successful.
Lovely as a stall or river.</v>

577
00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:41.940
Excellent.
They have nothing in common.
Didn't know you had a sister.

578
00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:43.133
She's retarded.

579
00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:47.080
<v 0>That's so,
that's the movie.
Anyways.
You want to try to watch it over the weekend?</v>

580
00:37:47.081 --> 00:37:51.460
Of course.
It's all I've ever wanted.
I'm pretty excited about it.

581
00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:55.600
But then I got pointed to this other mug.
We were talking about this.

582
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:59.050
Everyone started sending me clips of this movie.
They're like,
have you seen it?

583
00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:03.170
<v 10>Miss
Carolyn Steven's life together?
It was perfect.</v>

584
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:09.860
I've got to get going right the second.
Hey Baby.
Hey,

585
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:16.990
there's one small problem.
Uh,
I'm wrong.
I'm his brother.

586
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.983
We're twins.

587
00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:22.830
<v 0>So this is Matthew mcconaughey and what's that actor's name there?</v>

588
00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:27.810
That was such a famous actor.
This was Gary Oldman.
Yeah,
Gary Oldman.

589
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:28.950
Are you kidding me?

590
00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:34.230
<v 10>And your parents?
It can tear them apart.</v>

591
00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:38.410
I think you've got to let me know that everyone in your pants is images,
images,

592
00:38:38.411 --> 00:38:41.240
Carolyn doors.
Bring them together.

593
00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:43.283
<v 0>Are you</v>

594
00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:48.230
<v 10>welcome?
I'm Steven.
There you are.</v>

595
00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:52.000
This is Steven's father Bruno and his mom Kathleen and over behind the bar

596
00:38:52.001 --> 00:38:56.690
students,
brother.
He could have prepared us for this study.
I think bass me,

597
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:58.270
I'll never speak to cancer.
Just get it together.

598
00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:04.640
<v 0>It doesn't,
it looks completely made up.
This looks like a parody.
Yeah,</v>

599
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:09.060
this is Gary Oldman.
Gary Oldman.
Matthew mcconaughey.
Kate was in that.

600
00:39:09.061 --> 00:39:13.120
Kate Beckinsale is this ridiculously a list?
Cats,
right?

601
00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:17.810
And then they're all Matthew mcconaughey.
When did this come out?

602
00:39:17.811 --> 00:39:18.770
And this is a joke.

603
00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:23.810
<v 10>When the going gets rough,
it's only the size of your heart.</v>

604
00:39:23.811 --> 00:39:28.560
That sounds his voiceover,
this great gal.

605
00:39:28.561 --> 00:39:30.750
And you didn't tell her that her baby's probably gonna be lit.

606
00:39:30.751 --> 00:39:35.520
I'm not like you will also cute and cuddly discriminate against us.

607
00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:40.250
<v 0>Guy From game of Thrones.
Dinklage yeah,</v>

608
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:43.930
<v 10>this thing looks insane.</v>

609
00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:03.310
<v 0>How did this get,
this is crazy.
Why can't I get more movies made?
This is,</v>

610
00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:06.250
I don't know.
But when did this come out man?

611
00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:08.260
I mean this is blowing my mind right now.

612
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:12.340
That came out in 2003 that's why it got buried.

613
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:16.300
But the thing is to get the,
okay,
so here's the trivia.

614
00:40:16.301 --> 00:40:20.920
Can't even direct your Matthew Bright was fired after he turned in this cut and

615
00:40:20.921 --> 00:40:22.510
the whole film was in re edited.

616
00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.570
Peter Dinklage has said the original director's cut,

617
00:40:25.571 --> 00:40:27.430
which screened in Austin was gorgeous.

618
00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:29.920
But the people who fired him ruin the movie.

619
00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:33.580
So who knows?
Um,

620
00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:38.620
it looks really nutso.
God,
I want to see it so,
so stupid.

621
00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.390
I know.
It's like this

622
00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:44.180
<v 10>just a walked down the aisle in this,</v>

623
00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:46.820
the craziest voice over and just helps me

624
00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.000
is just a beginning.

625
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:53.430
<v 0>Sounds like a student film voiceover.</v>

626
00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:58.140
The copy does it.
I'm still reeling from the need to show her,

627
00:40:58.141 --> 00:41:02.520
giving him a blow job.
Oh,
and the first perfect relationship.

628
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:07.410
And she's blowing him.
Yeah.
Like that's the,
okay.
He's like careful.

629
00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:10.320
I got magic come in there and then they cut to the next thing.

630
00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.230
Is that what I missed that?
Yeah.

631
00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:17.830
Oh fuck.
And they have a baby

632
00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:22.640
<v 10>and now to some Langley productions,
probably present command performances.</v>

633
00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:25.210
Kate Beckinsale,
Matthew mcconahey,

634
00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:31.080
Patricia Arquette achieve a lifetime gather all in my lifetime.

635
00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:33.010
That's one way of saying

636
00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:39.280
<v 0>tiptoes.
Joke.
Yeah.</v>

637
00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:40.580
It's really crazy.

638
00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:48.200
Yeah,
of course.
Now,
what would happen?
I mean,

639
00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:52.790
this movie would never come out.
It's really crazy,
man.

640
00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:00.090
But that voiceover guy,
you're not fixated on it.
I cannot get over that.
Horrible.

641
00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:04.430
It's horrible.
It's notably bad.
Yeah.
And it's like the copy all bed and his,

642
00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:08.450
they got like the cheap voiceover guy.
It's all bad.

643
00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:12.740
Why didn't you hire the real voiceover guy?
You know,
world.
Yeah.
I know.

644
00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:16.760
Tip toes tip toes in that role of a lifetime.

645
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:19.070
The role of a lifetime.

646
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:25.160
Gary Old Gary Old,
he said,
Matthew mcconahey,
he said it wrong.

647
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:30.170
I've never heard it said
that's what you want.
I met Matthew Mcconaughey,
right?

648
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:34.910
No,
I was at a party.
Yeah.
So I used to hang out with this,
do,

649
00:42:34.911 --> 00:42:39.911
I took an acting class like 2003 the one of the guys in my class was a tennis

650
00:42:40.521 --> 00:42:45.521
instructor to a very wealthy lady whose husband divorced her.

651
00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:47.970
No,
he,

652
00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:52.610
she lived across the street from Matthew Mcconaughey and directly next to her

653
00:42:52.611 --> 00:42:54.290
lived at an arms dealer,

654
00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:58.160
like a Saudi arms dealer who had bulletproof cars and shit.

655
00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:02.780
And One night I went over,
I was hanging out,
we go,
he's like,
oh,

656
00:43:02.781 --> 00:43:07.480
the neighbors having a party,
the Nate though the arms guys like I dunno,

657
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:12.050
close to 60.
And everyone at this parties in their twenties.
Right.

658
00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:16.670
And then I see someone on his basketball court,

659
00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:22.610
uh,
wearing swim trunks and nothing else.
I'm like,
who the fuck is that?

660
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:26.450
Matthew mcconaughey.
And then he comes over and like the girls are like,

661
00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:30.920
oh my God,
it's about the Bakala Ohio.
And the girl goes,
how do you spell that?

662
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:33.970
And he goes,
that's a good question.
Then then he spelled icon,
hey,

663
00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:37.880
and then she goes,
can you say it again?
And he was like,
yeah.

664
00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.510
And he spelled his last name again.
And then I realized,

665
00:43:41.511 --> 00:43:45.080
because he has this great lush hair,
he had goggles,

666
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:50.120
swim goggles on,
and then he put them on and then he was like,

667
00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:51.500
I already spelled it twice for you

668
00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:59.270
somehow.
And this is like early two thousands.
That was in the,

669
00:43:59.271 --> 00:44:03.800
uh,
you know,
like us weekly.
There was pictures of that party.

670
00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:06.680
The goggles?
No,
just him being at this party.

671
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:08.810
Why was he wearing goggles when he was playing?

672
00:44:08.811 --> 00:44:09.950
Because he was wearing swimming trunks,

673
00:44:09.951 --> 00:44:13.080
so he's probably swimming at his house and then he came over and he was losing

674
00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:15.590
his piece of flair.
Like,

675
00:44:15.591 --> 00:44:19.650
you know how mystery was flair mysteries to tell guys if they want to eat,

676
00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:23.870
you need to have like an odd item on you.
The girls will ask about.
Yeah,
yeah.

677
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:29.010
I thought maybe that's what that was.
Yeah.
Interesting.
It's very,

678
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:33.840
very odd.
Very odd experience.
I was like,
oh,

679
00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:37.290
that's Matthew mcconaughey.
He's just like us.
Just like us.

680
00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.090
Celebrities are just like,
yeah,
just like us.

681
00:44:39.091 --> 00:44:43.860
He's plays basketball and his shorts with swimming goggles on.
Just like us.

682
00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:48.960
Yup.
Oh,
fucking Miami tippy toes.
Tip Toes,

683
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:53.820
tip toes.
I have a midget baby.

684
00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:58.620
She gets knocked up and then that's terrible.
Yeah,
it doesn't,

685
00:44:58.621 --> 00:45:03.150
he doesn't tell her that he has that DNA.
Then you tip toes.

686
00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:12.330
I mean,
just give somebody a heads up so that they can decide.

687
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:17.460
You should probably let them know.
Just Carolyn doors.
That's a good point.
Hey,

688
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:19.260
but she was blowing him all the time.

689
00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:22.950
You think that she didn't get nuts busted in her?
That was the implication.

690
00:45:22.951 --> 00:45:26.390
And it's top of movie.
That's true.
She's sucking his wiener all day long.

691
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.490
That's really good point.
Really cool way of putting that.

692
00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:33.540
It's just like the gays.
Okay.
They do to,
you know,

693
00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:38.520
like get is um,
gene,
would you like to try a,
would you rather?

694
00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:42.690
Yeah,
I think this is a,
yeah,
this came in here from our listeners.
Hi,

695
00:45:42.691 --> 00:45:47.670
Mommy's love you both love the podcast after a major decadent dinner binge

696
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.880
followed by some dental care.
I thought of this.
Would you rather,

697
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:54.900
would you rather never be able to floss again?
Ooh,
no,

698
00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:58.050
but only half of the calories of every food you eat counted

699
00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:02.250
or floss with abandoned.

700
00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:05.190
Never have another dental update issue again.

701
00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:09.740
But all of the foods you eat count as one and a half times their co.
Fuck.

702
00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:15.090
Oh my God.
First one,
former fatty with great teeth.
Arianna first one.

703
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:17.700
I know,
right?
I would just be too fat.
That'd be such,

704
00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:21.750
I mean I feel like my body already processes calories as double what they're

705
00:46:21.751 --> 00:46:24.390
worth.
So you give me this thing,

706
00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:29.400
I'm fucking 400 pounds by the fall.
I mean by,
by the new year.
I know.

707
00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:33.660
So yeah,
I can't do it.
However,
when we were in Napa Valley,

708
00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:35.403
I,
we,

709
00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:40.110
I had eaten meat and then afterwards I was panicked because I didn't think there

710
00:46:40.111 --> 00:46:41.240
was dental floss.
Yeah.

711
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:44.580
So I was like pulling strings out of my shirt and flossing and shit.

712
00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:49.290
It was terrible.
I don't like that feeling of meat stuck in my team.

713
00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.240
I have so much,
I mean,

714
00:46:51.241 --> 00:46:53.730
it's always a struggle and I think it will always be a struggle.

715
00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:58.230
But if so much awareness about food and exercise now,

716
00:46:58.231 --> 00:46:59.880
especially in the last couple of years,

717
00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:04.890
and I realized how weak and vulnerable I can be to this,

718
00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:07.080
especially because we,
uh,

719
00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:12.350
we had a driver who picked us up who had a box of pastries.
He was like,
oh,

720
00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:13.680
I got these this morning.

721
00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:19.020
And he handed it to us when we were on our way and I opened that thing and I was

722
00:47:19.021 --> 00:47:22.920
like,
it was like fresh croissants and just pastries.

723
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.740
I started to devour these things.
Oh yeah.

724
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:30.940
It was just mid morning and we got to our hotel and I was like,

725
00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:34.390
I feel sick.
And you're like,
oh,
what's wrong?
I'm like,
I don't know.

726
00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:38.680
I think I just ate too many pastries right now cause I couldn't control myself.

727
00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:43.180
Yeah,
I really,
I was like,
yeah.
If somebody is just like,
Oh,

728
00:47:43.181 --> 00:47:45.850
do you want these delicious treats?
I'm like,
okay.

729
00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:50.950
I don't do the normal thing of like I'll have one or no,
I'm good.

730
00:47:50.951 --> 00:47:54.910
I already ate.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's true.
You do like sweets.

731
00:47:54.911 --> 00:47:59.720
That's your jam right there.
I like all food.
That's true.
People always like,

732
00:47:59.721 --> 00:48:02.530
do you like sweets?
I'm like,
not any more than I like other foods.
I like food.

733
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:07.390
I like to eat.
It's a such a struggle.
Um,

734
00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:10.660
what's this here?
Here's another one.
Hey,
John and Christine.

735
00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:14.470
She's just my boyfriend and I listened to your old.

736
00:48:14.471 --> 00:48:17.300
What'd you rather as we have a quick new one for the mommies.
Okay.

737
00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.090
Would you rather go pee?

738
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:23.890
Would you rather go pee pee in your pants every time you do a standup show?
Fuck.

739
00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:27.400
I pretty much do.
Or Shit,
your pants.
Every time you do a podcast,

740
00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:32.720
I must remain in the said soiled items of clothing for the duration of either

741
00:48:33.131 --> 00:48:35.800
the standup show or the podcast.
You've got to be out of your fucking mind.

742
00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:39.100
This is an easy one.
You can't make it this easy.
Of course,

743
00:48:39.101 --> 00:48:40.540
I'm going to stay in there and my piss.

744
00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:43.570
I'm not gonna sit here in my shit pants and do podcasts.

745
00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:48.160
I pretty much pee every time.
I laugh.
Every time I laugh and my Pants,

746
00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:51.390
I've got pee pants,
pee panties,
and I where you pee on?

747
00:48:51.391 --> 00:48:56.000
Like any exertion of saying something,
but I left my kid up.
I piss,

748
00:48:56.001 --> 00:48:59.920
I laugh,
I pass.
I'm really used to it by now.
Yeah.

749
00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:02.260
It's not that it's not that severe.

750
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:06.210
I mean it would suck to do every show.
You're like,
all right,

751
00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:08.650
I gotta do my show now.
And you pissed and you stay there.

752
00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:11.810
I do stand there and soaked pallets,
so,
but that's,

753
00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:16.020
there's pee in my panties.
That's what this is saying.
Like soaked,

754
00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:19.000
soaked.
Would you rather sit and soaked pants,

755
00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:21.610
standing soaked pants or sit and shit pants?

756
00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:25.660
No one wants to sit in shit pants and sit here for a whole podcast,

757
00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:30.670
choose PP people.
It was just so nasty,
so fucking nasty.

758
00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:36.070
Here's a cool guy.
If you don't know this guy,
um,

759
00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:41.540
there's this cool dad right here,
okay.

760
00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:47.110
Dressed up as a a Nazi and dressed his son up as Hitler.

761
00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:50.350
And he's like,
what does everyone,
uh,
I'm a history buff.

762
00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:54.880
Cause that's what you think of when you see people in here.
You're like,

763
00:49:54.881 --> 00:49:59.110
this guy fucking loves history.
You Watch that,
uh,

764
00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:02.380
you watching the history channel thing.
And he's like,
yeah,
how'd you know?

765
00:50:02.381 --> 00:50:06.640
I'm like,
well,
you're wearing that Nazi gear.
And he's like,
I just finished it,

766
00:50:06.641 --> 00:50:10.090
man.
It's a great series.
Yeah.
World War Two man.
Wild stuff.

767
00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:15.490
I'm trying to think of another costume that's inherently such a bad idea.

768
00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:20.520
Like is there another figure in our history that's equally as I charged?

769
00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:23.940
I mean,
I think it goes,
look,
I'm not a,

770
00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:28.070
I'm not a social justice warrior by any stretch,
but even I know

771
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:32.030
<v 3>that like,
that's just kind of a,
no,
no.
And I'm not,
I'm not pushing for that guys.</v>

772
00:50:32.031 --> 00:50:36.980
Right.
To do that.
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?
It's like you don't go,

773
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:41.210
you just don't.
You don't go a Stalin,
you don't go Hitler,

774
00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:46.600
<v 0>but what's even more amazing is how brash it is to get upset that people were</v>

775
00:50:48.501 --> 00:50:50.180
upset about it.
I mean,
this guy

776
00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:56.830
wore this to a Halloween event and he got upset with people who got upset with

777
00:50:58.011 --> 00:51:01.520
him.
He wore an s s outfit dress.

778
00:51:01.521 --> 00:51:05.570
His five year old son is Hitler,
put them in a fake mustache,
swats it.

779
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:11.690
Photo was taken.
He was at an Owensboro annual event,
which kids trick or treat?

780
00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:12.450
Oh my God.

781
00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:17.450
The costume understandably offended many people and afterwards he shared his

782
00:51:17.931 --> 00:51:20.460
indignation in a Facebook post.
Yeah.

783
00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:24.710
Anyone who knows us knows we love history and we often dress as historical

784
00:51:24.711 --> 00:51:28.610
figures.
Okay.
Tonight as we walked,
we saw people dressed as murderers,

785
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:34.010
devil's serial killers of blood and Gore.
Nobody batted an eye,
but me,
I mean,

786
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:35.083
my little guy,

787
00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:39.620
we dressed as these historical figures and all kinds of people were making snide

788
00:51:39.621 --> 00:51:43.820
remarks and approaching us and threatening my little five year old boy who was

789
00:51:43.821 --> 00:51:48.600
just dressed as Hitler.
I don't get it.
What's going on with people right now?

790
00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:53.160
<v 3>You're saying that I'm out of line.</v>

791
00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:59.640
Jeez,
guy had an accident.
Head blood falling out of his head.

792
00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:02.690
Nobody said anything.
I guess.
You know what would be the equivalent?

793
00:52:02.850 --> 00:52:03.740
You guys are crazy.

794
00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:08.180
You know it'd be the equivalent is somebody dressed as Osama bin Ladin maybe.

795
00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:12.750
Right?
Cause that's such another hated historical figure like you,

796
00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:16.370
you know what?
That person did dip shit.
Yeah.
It's not,

797
00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:20.210
it's just not very intelligent.
You think it's not intelligent?

798
00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:25.100
I don't know,
but I'm trying to,
I mean,
look,
I,

799
00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:29.390
I'm all for freedom of expression,
but you just know that's a stupid one.

800
00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:33.560
It seems.
It seems like a lot,
like what's the victory?
You know what I mean?

801
00:52:33.561 --> 00:52:37.490
Like you're fighting to do that.
All right.
Yeah.
I'm not,
I don't know this guy.

802
00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:42.200
That's your thing.
You have to dress like Hitler.
I'm different.

803
00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:47.090
I approved juice,
so I'm not like that guy.
You have to do that.

804
00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:49.700
I mean,
I like him.
I mean,
this is like a coincidence.

805
00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:54.710
I like history and then it so happened I was dressed as a history guy and then

806
00:52:54.711 --> 00:52:58.610
you guys get,
maybe you need to read more history.
That's,
that's kid's defense,

807
00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:03.230
I guess.
You don't like history at all.
It's so bizarre.
You know?
Ah,

808
00:53:03.231 --> 00:53:06.890
the world is upside down.
It's something,

809
00:53:06.891 --> 00:53:08.650
I think you've always been like this by the way.
One,

810
00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:11.240
I'm glad somebody sent this in that it's,

811
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:15.370
you get uncomfortable watching old people be flirty or sexy.
Yeah,

812
00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:17.390
it's disgusting.
And this guy,

813
00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:21.920
I think he's recording his dad flirting on the phone.
Oh No,
I love it.

814
00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:26.110
Love it.
That's the guy's dad.
Tell me fuck off.
And sometimes

815
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.360
<v 11>they give me a little warning</v>

816
00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:35.790
today I was going to take advantage of you.
Oh boy.

817
00:53:35.791 --> 00:53:38.770
Hey you go try and give me [inaudible].

818
00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:43.060
<v 0>That's like someone's dad talking in front of them too.
Right?
That's weird.</v>

819
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:44.230
So nasty.

820
00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:48.270
Legit talking in front of your kid like you got me all warmed up right now.
Yeah.

821
00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:52.300
Give me a feel and all kinds of ways of getting horny.
So nasty.
Huh?

822
00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:56.050
<v 11>Go tell him my damn mom on you.
Try to take advantage of me.</v>

823
00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:59.680
I get my drug.
Yeah,

824
00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:02.660
I'd be a damn shame when you were on it.

825
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:04.070
Where's you're going to make me feel good?

826
00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:07.090
<v 0>Uh Huh.</v>

827
00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:10.690
<v 11>Huh?
Oh,
okay.
God,</v>

828
00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:14.900
if you're trying to get Dan to calm down

829
00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:21.500
the street and at the end of condoms to kind of back.
Oh boy.

830
00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:28.400
<v 0>You know,
that's just a disgusting is hearing your parents tell you dirty jokes.</v>

831
00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:31.130
It's a lot.
Yeah.
That's a form of like child abuse.

832
00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:34.370
When you tell it like you,

833
00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:37.940
when you're sex overtly sexual in front of your children,
it's abuse.

834
00:54:37.941 --> 00:54:39.560
It's disgusting.
It's,
it's,
yeah.

835
00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:44.840
I had a friend whose mother would always tell dirty jokes to him like sexual

836
00:54:46.011 --> 00:54:49.340
jokes and it's totally messed him up.
I don't think it's good.

837
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:53.870
Could you imagine your mother being Luth Tomi Tomi photo makes me so

838
00:54:56.750 --> 00:55:01.570
your father has a huge cook.
Oh,
and he make me so horny.
Yeah.

839
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:05.570
Yeah.
I do have big balls,

840
00:55:05.571 --> 00:55:10.310
but he does.
I've seen them,
but he didn't show them to me.

841
00:55:10.311 --> 00:55:15.050
I just happened to see them.
What,
how slips around on the bed?
No,

842
00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.420
he was,
he was in his room.

843
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:21.350
I walked in unannounced and he had already showered and he was putting on

844
00:55:21.351 --> 00:55:23.790
underwear.
I saw him bend down.
Oh my God.

845
00:55:23.791 --> 00:55:27.290
And I saw these big pig nuts from behind.
He does have five PSI now.

846
00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:29.960
We've talked about this before.
I've seen his nuts.
They're not good.

847
00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:33.020
They're enormous.
But you're not.
You're going to be that big two that you think.

848
00:55:33.110 --> 00:55:37.040
Oh,
they're not already.
That's what I got to start making fetish videos.

849
00:55:37.041 --> 00:55:42.041
I think when your cash and the 70s and the way you like old hanky nuts,

850
00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:47.810
then I'll have like my special clips and big farts.

851
00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.200
I got nuts and,

852
00:55:50.201 --> 00:55:54.260
and it'll just be all have like 50 male fans all over the world.

853
00:55:54.261 --> 00:55:58.970
Who was like 50 far on your balls for us,
Tom.
I'll be like,
pay pal me

854
00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:03.610
20 bucks.
I'm not going to far for nothing.
All right.

855
00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:08.850
I make my special videos.
Yeah.
As hasn't come through yet.

856
00:56:08.851 --> 00:56:13.610
I'm not far until I get the money.
How much would you demand for stuff like that?

857
00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:16.220
Yeah,
I dunno.
I Dunno.
I got it.
I got to study the market,

858
00:56:16.221 --> 00:56:20.060
but I got to study the market per fart.
$50 a fart.

859
00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:24.220
Yeah,
but I want multiple people paying for them.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

860
00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:27.040
<v 3>That's pretty good money.
You got that hundred dollar farts,
man.</v>

861
00:56:27.110 --> 00:56:31.240
If people were sending you 100 bucks per farm,
multiple people.
I know.

862
00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:34.480
It's a good business model.
Yeah.
Retire from comedy years ago.

863
00:56:34.481 --> 00:56:38.940
I fart on my balls all the time.
They foreign on my balls.

864
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:40.541
That'd be my video.

865
00:56:40.541 --> 00:56:44.410
I tucked my balls between my legs right near my asshole and I know what,

866
00:56:44.411 --> 00:56:48.430
check this out.
I fart on my balls.
People are like,
oh my God,

867
00:56:48.431 --> 00:56:49.780
your videos get me so hot.

868
00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:56.950
Men are so nasty.
There me guys out there like this.

869
00:56:56.951 --> 00:57:01.220
The hardest fucking thing around.
So nasty.
Yeah.
Why are you so nasty?

870
00:57:01.221 --> 00:57:02.780
Ties are super nasty.

871
00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:08.030
<v 11>Oh,
I don't want to know all the way out.
Oh</v>

872
00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:13.740
boy.
You bake button.

873
00:57:13.741 --> 00:57:14.740
Damn toes curl.

874
00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:21.290
<v 3>My Dad was so inappropriate like he used to have,
um,</v>

875
00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:24.930
I tell you that he'd have a beer that you would scratch off and you can see

876
00:57:24.931 --> 00:57:28.670
ladies,
Ted's uh Huh.
So He'd be like,
go get him a beer.
I've quit.

877
00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:30.120
I was always getting my dad to beer.
Yeah.

878
00:57:30.210 --> 00:57:33.330
And then he would scratch scratchers and see the tits on how many times you get

879
00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:35.760
a beer you think?
Every night as my job really.

880
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:38.910
Of course you get him the reflux that was an alcoholic.

881
00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:42.600
That's all you do is you learn how to open beer when you're young and bring

882
00:57:42.601 --> 00:57:46.050
drinks when you're young.
That's what alcoholic children brush one all the time.

883
00:57:46.070 --> 00:57:49.660
Oh of course.
That's the only time he paid attention to me is when I was braking

884
00:57:51.930 --> 00:57:54.480
or we be watching the game together and I'd be like,

885
00:57:54.481 --> 00:57:55.860
can I have some of your beer?

886
00:57:55.890 --> 00:57:58.980
And that was like big deal and really pay attention to me then.

887
00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:00.360
And then he'd give me some,

888
00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:04.380
a little bit of beer in a and a cop and dilute it and let me drink some with him

889
00:58:04.381 --> 00:58:08.880
and I felt really special then.
That is kind of Nice.
How old were you?
Seven.

890
00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:12.690
Eight,
nine 10 sure,
sure.

891
00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:15.720
And then he had a Rubik's cube under uh,

892
00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:19.680
there was like a naked lady Rubik's cube.
It's like there,

893
00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:23.430
you know you do Rubik's has different naked ladies on every site.

894
00:58:23.431 --> 00:58:24.930
And that was just out in the house too.

895
00:58:24.931 --> 00:58:27.630
So that was kind of cool as a little girl to see that stuff growing up.

896
00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:29.200
What'd you think of it?
Like,
hmm.

897
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:36.060
<v 9>Right.
Really?
This is cool.
Well,</v>

898
00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:39.210
<v 3>the confusing part because you're stoked because it's a Rubik's cube and you're</v>

899
00:58:39.211 --> 00:58:43.320
a little kid and you're like,
oh sweet,
we've got one of these.
Wait a minute,

900
00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:47.400
there's tits on,
wait a minute.
This is something new.

901
00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:51.660
So that's kind of the thing.
You're one hand excited and then the other hand,

902
00:58:51.661 --> 00:58:53.610
like not,
it feels weird.

903
00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:56.700
There's those people that can do a Rubik's cube in like 30 seconds.
Yeah.

904
00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:58.210
What do you think,
what's going on there?

905
00:58:58.230 --> 00:59:01.350
Back in the 80s there a lot of people that could do that.
I mean,

906
00:59:01.351 --> 00:59:04.740
I'm talking about now,
do you see people in video?
They're like,
oh,
check this out.

907
00:59:04.741 --> 00:59:08.220
But I don't know.
That's such a gift.
Yeah.
How do you see that?
How do you do it?

908
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:11.790
Such a talent.
Something tells me they might not be the best that conversation,

909
00:59:11.791 --> 00:59:16.470
but it's probably mild Asperger's.
How'd he do it?
And they're like,
wow.

910
00:59:16.530 --> 00:59:20.820
Yeah,
you don't see it.
You're like,
oh,
that was great.

911
00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:24.440
Thanks.
This rock back and forth.

912
00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:28.840
Of course that's who can do that shit.
I wonder if this guy can do it.

913
00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:31.460
So I've been having,
I had this video for a while,
but I didn't know.

914
00:59:31.850 --> 00:59:34.780
I figured you would like this guy.
So I saved it for a minute.
Okay.
And then,

915
00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:35.350
I don't know.

916
00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:36.690
<v 11>Hello everyone.
Welcome back to another video.</v>

917
00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:41.560
Dimensionalist I'm a dimensionalist today I am going to recite the Lord's prayer

918
00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:45.310
and Aisha Air Mac and the best way I can.

919
00:59:46.830 --> 00:59:47.010
<v 9>Okay.</v>

920
00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:49.190
<v 11>I don't even know what happened there.
Oh,
I'm sorry,</v>

921
00:59:49.191 --> 00:59:53.880
I got to 100% but it's likes people pronounce an English word and you know that

922
00:59:53.881 --> 00:59:56.580
what they,
how they hear it and you know,
hey,
that's right.

923
00:59:56.890 --> 00:59:59.250
Or that's almost everybody.
You understand that as,
that's the word.

924
00:59:59.251 --> 01:00:02.660
But it Kinda got it all,
but it's,
it's right kind of

925
01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:08.440
<v 3>look like one of your friends a little bit.
He's like,
he reminds me,</v>

926
01:00:08.441 --> 01:00:09.880
one of your friends know.

927
01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:14.050
<v 11>So here it goes.
I don't like this at all.
Excuse me.</v>

928
01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:16.420
I really got ready for getting it ready for us.
Cause hard,

929
01:00:16.421 --> 01:00:19.560
very hard to pronounce.
And he's a syllabus is Aramaic words.
Okay.

930
01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:25.400
Um,
handlebars.
Shamar Knox College.

931
01:00:25.401 --> 01:00:28.690
Shamar Dae Dae Malta.

932
01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:33.960
<v 3>Is that for I need new teeth.
I don't know the whole thing.</v>

933
01:00:33.961 --> 01:00:37.290
It kind of makes me squirm.
What is it about flow?
Okay,

934
01:00:37.291 --> 01:00:39.890
I'll tell you what's it's on him.
It's too cold.

935
01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:44.420
It's good submission is what you're saying.
It is very close.
Uh,

936
01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:49.710
he is wearing a shirt,
which is a little depressing.
The framings wrong.

937
01:00:49.770 --> 01:00:50.760
I like the background.

938
01:00:50.761 --> 01:00:55.530
I'm seeing an old fridge and seeing a lot of plastic and miscellaneous drugs,

939
01:00:55.531 --> 01:00:58.950
but I end something.
Something's wrong,
you know,
so there's a balance there.

940
01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:04.020
Something's naturally wrong,
but it's not exacerbated by drugs.

941
01:01:04.021 --> 01:01:04.910
So that's a little bit of a,

942
01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:10.620
<v 9>okay.</v>

943
01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:15.240
<v 3>Uh,
the lighting's terrible.
The audio is good,
decent,
decent.</v>

944
01:01:15.241 --> 01:01:16.470
I'm upset about that.

945
01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:21.600
And there is some white noise in the ballet or something like that for his

946
01:01:21.601 --> 01:01:24.810
video.
This is a video he's hoping we'd be viewed,

947
01:01:24.811 --> 01:01:29.220
I'm sure by a lot of people who wanted to see him speak Aramaic.
Luckily for him,

948
01:01:29.221 --> 01:01:32.260
we got ahold of it and now people are seeing it.
Yeah.

949
01:01:35.310 --> 01:01:36.140
Um,

950
01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:41.140
I'm also really liking the camera angles on his skin condition and his teeth

951
01:01:42.061 --> 01:01:44.430
condition.
Like it's very good.
Well,

952
01:01:44.431 --> 01:01:48.660
it's neat to see it all very close because you don't want to be like,

953
01:01:48.661 --> 01:01:51.380
what's wrong with his teeth?
Oh,
I see what's wrong.
Oh,

954
01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:55.200
thank you for showing his skin.
This is what,
very close,

955
01:01:55.201 --> 01:01:57.330
almost microscopic view of what's wrong.

956
01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:59.970
This is what a dermatologist would be saying.
Sure.

957
01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:04.530
The thing is we all have flaws.
Yes.
But you don't want to close up.

958
01:02:05.010 --> 01:02:09.240
You want to hide them.
You want to conceal,
you want to trigger the light.
Yeah.

959
01:02:09.690 --> 01:02:11.970
Hold the camera on the other side of your face.

960
01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:16.030
<v 9>Okay.</v>

961
01:02:16.030 --> 01:02:18.730
<v 3>But you're right.
It does have all the makings.</v>

962
01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:25.260
It is a quality submission.
A lot of shit in the background,

963
01:02:25.261 --> 01:02:28.060
the poor lighting,
a lot of stuff.
Not,

964
01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:33.210
not lacking in stuff.
Yeah,
I dunno.
I love it.

965
01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.240
Ways Don Canam,

<v 3>your review of his Aramaic could because that,</v>

972
01:02:59.381 --> 01:03:04.381
especially that exchange sounded like I can make up anything and nobody will

973
01:03:04.811 --> 01:03:09.310
know that this is not Aramaic.
Well,
this is a phenomenon.
No,

974
01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:14.560
no way.
But when you're learning air magnet like
La,

Not Good.</v>

982
01:03:39.121 --> 01:03:43.050
Not Good Mecca.
Mecca.
Isn't this what hillbillies do when they speak in tongues?

983
01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:47.340
Different how Shababa hello,
hello.
[inaudible] is nonsense.

984
01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:49.440
So it really dumb people do.

985
01:03:50.610 --> 01:03:53.460
I try to tell you that they're really feeling it when that happens.
You know,

986
01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:57.150
JC is tapping.

Hey,
I got to tell you something.
Sure.
Yeah,

987
01:03:58.290 --> 01:04:02.040
but that's what this is,
right?
The speaking in tongues to me.
Sounds similar.

988
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:07.190
Sounds like some bullshit.
Hotshot.
Hot.
Hot,

989
01:04:07.191 --> 01:04:11.310

996
01:04:33.021 --> 01:04:37.840
Jeremy,
what's all that mountain of bullshit behind him now that I'm looking?

997
01:04:38.010 --> 01:04:42.770
Uh,
I think Dr drew would say,
well,
there's a little bit a hoarding.
Um,

998
01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:46.990
definitely isn't that what camped?
There might be some mental illness,

999
01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:52.560
drugs or mental illness.
Let's see.
What's your money on?
Uh,

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:55.420
Yeah.

I'm going to go mental illness on this one too.

1001
01:04:55.930 --> 01:05:00.930

1002
01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:04.870
Yeah,

1003
01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:10.610
<v 9>yeah.
Oh no man.</v>

1004
01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:16.250
<v 3>Grilled chicken coming.
Yeah.
I like chicken.
I know you like chicken.</v>

1005
01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.010
I want some chicken right now.
You

1006
01:05:18.030 --> 01:05:21.580
<v 0>are so nasty.
Can you are just the nastiest?</v>

1007
01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:27.110
Why don't I don't I have my chicken.
I get low wire.

1008
01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:32.050
Why fuck you both of you?
I missed her.
I know.

1009
01:05:32.051 --> 01:05:35.210
She's so great.
Both of you.
Yup.

1010
01:05:35.410 --> 01:05:38.880
I can't wait to become like her shit.

1011
01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:44.200
What does that menopause,
that's like 10 years for me.
It's going to be great.

1012
01:05:44.410 --> 01:05:47.500
Cut that hair short.
Really shut it down and I can't wait

1013
01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:53.890
it out.
Get that real short haircut,
right?

1014
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:56.770
Much more.
Yeah,
like mine.

1015
01:05:56.771 --> 01:06:01.480
Mine's a good look for a woman for sure.
That's what they do.
That's funny.

1016
01:06:01.481 --> 01:06:05.870
To have this haircut as a woman,
you either have to be gorgeous.
Yeah.

1017
01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:08.800
Or not give a fuck.
Right.
One of the two.

1018
01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:14.130
You either so beautiful that this haircut actually just people just see your

1019
01:06:14.561 --> 01:06:18.040
face and be like,
wow,
she can pull off anything.
Definitely.
Or you're like,

1020
01:06:18.290 --> 01:06:20.630
it's repellent.
You Go,
I did this to people.

1021
01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:22.390
<v 3>I mean,
either you're like a model.</v>

1022
01:06:22.391 --> 01:06:26.290
You're in your 20s you could just wear a burlap sack and shave your head and

1023
01:06:26.291 --> 01:06:27.124
you're beautiful.

1024
01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:31.120
<v 0>But no,
no dude.
Yeah.
Most of you.
Nah,
Nah.</v>

1025
01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:36.960
Shit.
Pieces of shit.

1026
01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:41.640
Both pieces of shit
like her style,

1027
01:06:41.641 --> 01:06:43.650
man.
You know what?

1028
01:06:43.651 --> 01:06:48.651
The thing that fucking sucks about an evacuation we're about to do is just the

1029
01:06:49.531 --> 01:06:52.080
logistics of it.
The packing up things.

1030
01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:56.790
That's the part that actually is the most annoying.
Right?
You're like,
fuck,

1031
01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:59.640
I got to get everything together.
That part sucks.

1032
01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:03.690
We've already done that part though.
I know,
I know,
but that's what I'm saying.

1033
01:07:03.691 --> 01:07:04.524
It's like it's the

1034
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:08.700
<v 3>transporting thing.
Look,
it's all,
it's all bad,
but here's the,</v>

1035
01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:10.290
I would rather,

1036
01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:15.090
<v 0>you know,
do it at a leisurely pace and do it at a panicked rate when it's,</v>

1037
01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:19.320
when we're going to have to that.
Yeah.
And you know that's imminent.

1038
01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:21.720
So let's just do it now.

1039
01:07:22.350 --> 01:07:27.350
Settle in so we're not panicked when the call come and then this,

1040
01:07:28.801 --> 01:07:33.450
I figured it would be a,
somebody sent this,
this would be of interest to you.

1041
01:07:33.451 --> 01:07:34.830
Hey Tad and Katrina,

1042
01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:40.770
I thought you guys would appreciate this nugget of space.

1043
01:07:40.771 --> 01:07:45.771
Brown knowledge I found had I guess in a museum of some kind in Columbus,

1044
01:07:46.621 --> 01:07:49.140
Ohio and joy.
I'm not too dumb to come.
Lindsay

1045
01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:55.890
does the crew p it says,
oh yeah,

1046
01:07:56.290 --> 01:08:01.000
<v 3>the space station bathroom has a long plastic tube for collecting urine and a</v>

1047
01:08:01.001 --> 01:08:03.040
water free toilet for bowel movements.

1048
01:08:03.290 --> 01:08:06.280
I vacuum pulls waste into a special compartment,

1049
01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:08.320
foot straps at the base of the toilet.

1050
01:08:08.321 --> 01:08:11.500
Help keep the crew members from floating away while they're using the bathroom.

1051
01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:12.910
Well,
now this makes sense.

1052
01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:16.130
<v 0>Yeah,
you finally got it.
Oh,
hey fucking</v>

1053
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:19.670
<v 3>Gosling.
Why couldn't this be in the movie?
Yeah.
Where's that scene?</v>

1054
01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:22.280
I notice though,
there's nothing.
Nothing

1055
01:08:22.330 --> 01:08:26.960
<v 0>here about coming.
Yeah,
that's a real disappointed they ejaculate.
Yeah.</v>

1056
01:08:27.130 --> 01:08:31.330
Where's that one?
I want to know what they do when they finish,
you know,

1057
01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:33.340
shooting their load.
Where does that go?

1058
01:08:33.530 --> 01:08:38.300
<v 1>You know?
Oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,</v>

1059
01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:40.570
<v 3>she's really into this club today.</v>

1060
01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:47.390
<v 0>That's how you orgasm.
You're really into that one.
[inaudible] Canada high.
Well,</v>

1061
01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:49.110
no,
that's a guy just finishing off.

1062
01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:54.270
He's jacking his dick in space and then right as he's about to the lotuses load,

1063
01:08:54.271 --> 01:08:55.104
he's like,

1064
01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:59.120
<v 1>whoa.
Oh,</v>

1065
01:09:00.210 --> 01:09:02.010
<v 0>it's fun.
It's fun.
Clip.</v>

1066
01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:08.150
All right,
so it's an unusual week for us.
Um,

1067
01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:12.260
we didn't actually know if we would be able to record anything,
uh,

1068
01:09:12.270 --> 01:09:16.850
after this thing started because again,
our studios in our house,
um,

1069
01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:20.670
we're going to be leaving.
I don't know if we're coming back Monday,
Tuesday,

1070
01:09:20.690 --> 01:09:23.820
late or I don't know what's happening.
I know.
It's,
I mean,

1071
01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:28.830
<v 3>who knows?
Dude,
it's
crazy day for us.</v>

1072
01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:30.170
Crazy.
So,
well,

1073
01:09:30.171 --> 01:09:34.620
I'm glad we got to take a little break and get into silliness before we go into

1074
01:09:34.621 --> 01:09:37.440
this nonsense we're about to embark upon right now.

1075
01:09:38.170 --> 01:09:43.080
<v 0>You very much,
uh,
I know we have a lot of fans and supporters and um,</v>

1076
01:09:43.150 --> 01:09:47.980
we appreciate all your guys nice messages of course.
Um,
if you are in,

1077
01:09:47.981 --> 01:09:51.040
um,
you know,
a position to help people out,

1078
01:09:51.550 --> 01:09:55.120
luckily we don't need your help,
but there's a lot of people out here that do,

1079
01:09:55.121 --> 01:09:58.150
so look for those.
Maybe we can post some,
uh,

1080
01:09:58.630 --> 01:10:02.000
places that are accepting donations for people in need.
Yeah.

1081
01:10:02.230 --> 01:10:05.460
Especially out here in like thousand oaks area.
They went through a lot.

1082
01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:09.460
They got fucked.
Um,
so I'll try to find that and post that,

1083
01:10:09.490 --> 01:10:14.260
look on our social media,
Twitter and Instagram.
And,

1084
01:10:14.261 --> 01:10:18.930
um,
that's that man.
We,
uh,
we'll,
uh,
oh,

1085
01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:21.610
I fuck,
it's weird to say,
but they posted it.
They put it up.

1086
01:10:21.611 --> 01:10:24.100
So I'll just tell you,
we have,
um,

1087
01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:28.870
our holiday stuff or holiday merge went out,
um,

1088
01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:33.910
or is coming out this coming week.
So it's a,
it's like there's a bunch of,

1089
01:10:33.911 --> 01:10:38.230
you know,
there's ornaments,
there's a stocking this year.
The,
uh,

1090
01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:41.060
the sweater last year was Santa wears jeans.
This is what you guys here.

1091
01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:45.370
It's a Jesus wore jeans and there's also a,
Jesus wore jeans t shirt.

1092
01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:46.270
Um,

1093
01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:50.770
last year we donated a portion of our proceeds to children's Hospital of Los

1094
01:10:50.770 --> 01:10:53.730
Angeles.
This year we're donating to,
uh,

1095
01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.110
the starlight foundation.

1096
01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:01.450
And that is an organization that tries to make hospital stays,

1097
01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:06.760
uh,
easier,
more comfortable for kids.
So kids that are in hospitals,

1098
01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:10.780
it's sucks enough.
They do things like they'll instead of like,
you know,

1099
01:11:10.781 --> 01:11:15.390
hospital gowns are all shitty and rough.
They'll do things like,
uh,

1100
01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:20.070
get hospital gowns that have like team logos or,
you know,
kids favorite,

1101
01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:22.560
um,
cartoon characters.

1102
01:11:22.561 --> 01:11:27.330
And the new thing they're going for now is a virtual reality.
Um,
uh,

1103
01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:31.160
for kids in hospitals.
So hopefully what we're gonna do is,
uh,

1104
01:11:31.290 --> 01:11:36.060
we'll take a portion of our proceeds from our holiday merge and I hope we're in

1105
01:11:36.061 --> 01:11:40.710
a position where we can buy a few virtual reality goggles.

1106
01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:43.200
So,
and I'll document that.
I documented a,

1107
01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:46.230
a shopping trip last year to toys r us,

1108
01:11:46.231 --> 01:11:50.400
which amazingly I think the next month toysrus went out of business.

1109
01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:53.430
Can you believe it doesn't exist?
I know it was crazy.
I was like,

1110
01:11:53.431 --> 01:11:58.431
I was just there and we bought like carts of toys when we dropped it off at the

1111
01:11:58.621 --> 01:12:00.820
donation site.
But um,

1112
01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:03.300
I'll do something like that this year where I'll document it.

1113
01:12:03.301 --> 01:12:05.280
I like documenting at showing you what we're doing.

1114
01:12:05.281 --> 01:12:09.060
So we'll do that again this year.
Uh,
again,

1115
01:12:09.061 --> 01:12:12.140
this is a weird week for us,
man.
But,
uh,

1116
01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:14.770
hopefully we'll be back,
um,

1117
01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:20.060
in another week and we'll have a something to talk about and we'll be in a much

1118
01:12:21.301 --> 01:12:25.380
lighter and fun,
more fun mood.
But until then,
um,

1119
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:29.310
we're going to leave you,
I don't even have,
where's my,
I got,

1120
01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:33.720
I kind of play a song.
I don't have my songs and I have a song.

1121
01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:39.310
Let's see what I got here.
Okay,
I got something.
All right.
Um,

1122
01:12:39.550 --> 01:12:43.360
love you guys and we'll see you soon.
Bye.
Bye.

1123
01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:58.260
