00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.130
Do I have the,
uh,
my,
why am h thing?

45
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.270
I don't even know where that is.
Oh my God.
Wait,
which episode was last week?

46
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.770
Why 70 is that?
We don't have the intro.
I don't even have my a show open.

47
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.390
Oh my God.
Where is that?

48
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.640
<v 3>Oh my gosh.
Oh my gosh.</v>

49
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.990
You think you're ready to go and then you realize how many elements though.

50
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.110
I know he mom realized that there's so many moving parts to a podcast.

51
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.690
We've got the visual,
the audio,
the drops,
so you have to prepare.

52
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.510
And then just getting to the intro,
soc can sometimes be annoying.
I do.

53
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.940
I mess up on that deep,
Bro.
Constantly.
Yeah.
Well the thing is to a new computer,

54
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.750
new pooter,
a new pooter.
All right.

55
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.100
That's a little story for our listeners who don't know,

56
00:04:01.101 --> 00:04:04.550
but Tom got me this computer for me.
Yeah,

57
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.990
just as it everyday mommy and it's so complicated.
I like,

58
00:04:08.991 --> 00:04:12.490
I had a fucking nuclear meltdown because it was the end of the day we,

59
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.760
I spent all day with my kid.

60
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.480
You know how it is actually had a faulty thing out of the box.
We'll get into it.

61
00:04:17.481 --> 00:04:18.590
Let's let,
let's open this show.

62
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.200
Let's start the show and we'll get to the point is I can't,

63
00:04:21.201 --> 00:04:23.750
it's too much computer for me.
Yeah,
because I'm a mom.

64
00:04:23.751 --> 00:04:27.050
All I do is like check emails and look at photos and my kid and now it's our

65
00:04:27.051 --> 00:04:29.370
production.
Right.
I have no use for it.
Yeah.

66
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.980
<v 5>Do you want to open the shutters for me please?
One to speak to you.</v>

67
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:39.280
Your money out.
Well,
if you close the shutters,

68
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.040
of course they're gonna try and take my fucking property.

69
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.890
We've got shot as Dan this.

70
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.840
You have someone who looks into your house and says he's going to fuck this
shit.

71
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.310
Oh Shit.
Oh your said,
what are you going to do

72
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.970
right now?
Straight away from what I've seen.
Fuck you.
One cousin.

73
00:04:58.971 --> 00:05:00.420
Then it will be the Winco.

74
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.560
<v 1>Don't bring anyone in loving to then</v>

75
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.490
go to your mom's house or his own surgical.

76
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:16.763
Christina,

77
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.650
that sounds good.
Yeah.

78
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.213
Oh Shit.

79
00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.640
<v 0>I'm up in it in,</v>

80
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.680
in the urban dictionary and what comes up dog in a bathtub and you and I were

81
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:06.890
just having,
well yeah,
like what was there.
It's under,

82
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:08.930
it's like different trending now words.

83
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.210
You and I were having this very important debate about what dog and a bathtub
is.

84
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.420
Now you say it's the twigs and berries and the beans inside a woman's mouth.

85
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.190
It would be the berries and the beans.
Oh,
I'm sorry.
The twig and the berries.

86
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.653
I'm adding it.

87
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.770
I'm assuming there's two or four gentlemen there.
So yeah,
the twigs and berries.

88
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.000
I'm saying it's the twig in the berries,
inside a girl's machine.

89
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.290
You're saying?
Okay,
so let's see.
Dog in a bath tub.

90
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:45.620
This is the proper name for when you attempt to insert your nuts into a girl's

91
00:06:45.621 --> 00:06:46.850
ass.
Oh,

92
00:06:46.851 --> 00:06:51.050
that is so named because it can be just are keeping a dog in the bathtub while

93
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:53.300
giving it a bath.
Right.
We all white.
We know why.

94
00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:57.800
Because you can't keep the berries in.
They pop out,
but they're saying it's anal.

95
00:06:57.801 --> 00:07:01.280
So both of us are wrong.
I have to,
I have to.

96
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.330
I have to disagree.
So Do I.
Yeah.
I,

97
00:07:07.331 --> 00:07:09.290
I'm not anal.
No,

98
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.280
because don't you feel like a dog in a bathtub is hard to achieve in both the

99
00:07:13.281 --> 00:07:18.080
mouse or the vagina?
It's almost impossible.
Yeah,
that's not,
that's not correct.

100
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.320
That's not correct.
No.
I wish we had an authority on,

101
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:25.610
on the sort of thing.
I feel like,
look,
can I see one thing here?

102
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.810
I want to see if the intro I have here sounds different.
Sure.

103
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:34.840
I could play the audio in it and then let's see.

104
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.100
Ready?
Cause I know it means,
isn't it?

105
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:42.130
But sometimes English people use in it and it doesn't make sense.

106
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:46.730
Like he's like fucking Lancos in it that you wouldn't say fucking wankers,

107
00:07:46.731 --> 00:07:49.830
isn't it?
You know what I'm saying?
Because

108
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.160
<v 1>short.
Oh,
that sounds so much better.</v>

109
00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:02.630
[inaudible] better sound

110
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.340
there.
You shifted last time when this happened.

111
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.470
<v 0>Okay,
well here we go.
Matt
says,</v>

112
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:36.410
Huh?
I say that in my act now.
Oh good,
good,

113
00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:39.390
good.
Well Wyffels mine even a thing you made up.
I know.

114
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.010
I remember because we used to do

115
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:49.000
accents and then the thing was that you could always do British better cause you

116
00:08:49.001 --> 00:08:51.850
live there and I would do that impression and you were like,

117
00:08:51.851 --> 00:08:54.940
that's no one talks like that.
Actually I get,

118
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.320
I get that all my accents are better than yours.
Oh,
that's a nonsense.

119
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:02.160
Everybody that knows me knows everything,
knows that.
Everyone knows that.

120
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.880
I don't think so.
I feel like my accents are much better.
This is a really funny,

121
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:08.250
by the way,
the clip now that your dog shit,

122
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.120
but the and that and that and that.
How to get rid of that one.

123
00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:15.400
That's such a bad fog as fuck it.
Wackos and Avnet.

124
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.000
So here's what's happening guys.

125
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:22.040
A shopkeeper and the tax man came to collect because he owe taxes and he locked

126
00:09:23.431 --> 00:09:27.990
him in his store.
Nice.
So that's what's going on at the beginning of it.
The guy.

127
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.680
Oh,
the guy's like,
yeah,

128
00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:35.550
<v 5>the situation threatening to turn.
Really ugly.
Help arrives just in time.</v>

129
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.020
Shit.
Yeah.
Hello?
Hello.
That's the tax guy.
Yeah,

130
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.190
I put that together and make sure,
please.
Yeah.
Yeah.

131
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:49.020
Colin folks went off the song before he spoke to shut us down inside.

132
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:49.854
He won't open them.

133
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.630
This guy is going through trying to get his money together.

134
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.710
Putting the shockers for me.
Please face,
want to speak to you.

135
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.580
<v 0>That's funny that they bleeped him there,
right?
Maybe it wasn't a curse.</v>

136
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.890
Maybe it was like a name or something.
Yeah.

137
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.560
<v 5>Well if you close the shop is of course they called the Toronto take my fucking</v>

138
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:11.810
property.
He's right.

139
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:18.430
If somebody says he's going to fuck this shit.
Oh Shit.

140
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:21.820
Oh fuck the fuck you

141
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:28.450
want to see right now.
Straight away from what I've see.
Fuck you.
One cousin you.

142
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.293
Oh,
you can

143
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.880
<v 0>fucking Wagner's Aetna.
But grammatically wouldn't make sense.</v>

144
00:10:34.881 --> 00:10:39.740
So I guess the tax guy can,
can seize the actual items.
Property.
Yeah.

145
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.950
That's crazy.
Yeah.
A store like that.
When I guess we do that.

146
00:10:42.951 --> 00:10:45.740
The IRS will come and take your and your property.
Yeah.

147
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.360
<v 5>Oh,
do you think you're talking to now?
Are you gonna Arrest me?
Huh?</v>

148
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.080
Are you going to arrest?
What do I have to do it right?

149
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.810
How are you going to arrest?
What's going to have to pay?

150
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:59.010
<v 0>Yeah.
In our country,
the police will be like,
sir,
get back,
sir.</v>

151
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:02.020
There wasn't a camera there.
They would crack it in the fucking job.
Yeah.

152
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.200
<v 5>If you get yourself a rest state,</v>

153
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.850
you're not in a position to pay this debt payments.

154
00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.670
All you have to take all your stock,
MPF parking park.

155
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.380
Yeah.
Yeah.

156
00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:19.370
<v 0>That's super.
That's Super British.
He makes 15 P it's nothing.</v>

157
00:11:19.371 --> 00:11:22.970
15 pence is 15 cents.
15 cents.

158
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.780
While he's saying that's his margin on that bag of Doritos,
different gender.

159
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.860
Different business.
Get it.
Yeah.
That's not the business for you.
Yeah.
Yeah.

160
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:34.460
They don't make any money.
Those people 15 p yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

161
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:40.990
yeah.
It's a bit of a waffle is a bit,
but we're fighting.
Uh Huh.

162
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:42.360
Yeah.

163
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.650
<v 5>If you get yourself progress to date position department,</v>

164
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.170
which means I'm gonna have to take all your stop.
Not Stop.

165
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.440
I made fucking 15 pf fucking pack.

166
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.550
<v 0>That's so British.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

167
00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.590
No but no,
but yes,
but no,
but

168
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:04.820
I'm trying to fucking pay them

169
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:11.740
something.
It's probably he said his name.

170
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.950
Did you know expensive ciggies are empty?
His,
his uh,
Hey,

171
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:21.970
I've got a neat question.
You know what they call cigarettes in England?
Hmm?

172
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.900
How do you think it's a bit of a riddle?
I think they call them.
Fuck boys.

173
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:31.110
Not Fuck Boys.
They're definitely calls far.

174
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:33.520
Nope,
they're calling bags.
Bags.

175
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:37.270
But do you think because of the PC thing that now you can't even call
cigarettes?

176
00:12:37.271 --> 00:12:41.530
Fags?
No,
of course not.
I'm a couple of fags cause that's come up.
I'm a fag.

177
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:45.940
But that's still like we're talking to different countries with different,

178
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:50.430
but I feel like don't they inherit our political correctness to that word?

179
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.740
They would be like,
why would we stop?
Cause the,
that doesn't mean the same thing.

180
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:57.540
So why would that affect them?
Because it's fast.
It's like it's bad.
Yeah.

181
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.790
But that doesn't mean what it means here.
Yeah,
I know.
I know.

182
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.120
So why would that affect us?
Like them calling us the n word,

183
00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:07.890
they'd have to stop saying,
could you,
how mad,
you know,
big word.
Oh,

184
00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:12.700
you know what I'm saying?
Pull him back on it now.
You've never pulled back.

185
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.420
He can't say,
can you lend?
And they get a pencil.

186
00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:21.040
Why can't you say that?
Can't say it.
Why?
Well,
look at,

187
00:13:21.041 --> 00:13:24.280
let's say they called these Niggas,
you can't be lot.
We'd like a Nigga.

188
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:29.260
Can't say it.
Wait what?
Say it.
Yeah,

189
00:13:29.261 --> 00:13:33.990
but they've fag is bad too.
Now Fag.
Fag is equal to the n one.

190
00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:37.480
My point is at fag was never bad there.
So why would they care?

191
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:39.640
Because they're cousins of ours.

192
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.690
So our political correctness trickles across the pond to them.

193
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:48.940
They don't say the n word.
I don't think so.
No,
I don't think so,

194
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.960
dude.
Bro,
I know there are way more politically correct in some ways than we are.

195
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.130
Mm hmm.
Hmm.
Well,

196
00:13:57.131 --> 00:14:01.270
right in if you're from England,
a lot of British,
I know if you're British,

197
00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:02.740
tell it to you.
Still call them facts.

198
00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:07.430
And is that considered a little bit sensitive to call them facts?
She,

199
00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.490
I don't think,
I don't think that applies for this.
I really don't.

200
00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.100
Well then you might be right,
but I don't think so.
God Damn it.

201
00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:14.920
You know and it's fun.

202
00:14:14.921 --> 00:14:19.490
Now is how angry you get when the myriad of technology fails.
When the,

203
00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.590
the monitors goes to sleep,
you fucking lose your mind.
We got an email.

204
00:14:23.591 --> 00:14:27.460
Your lose your mind.
If I sat down for a minute,

205
00:14:27.461 --> 00:14:28.610
you lose your marbles.

206
00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:34.240
Can we just make a montage of blue ban of Tom getting angry every time it goes

207
00:14:34.241 --> 00:14:35.380
bad.
It's true.

208
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.850
This is short fuse and you shouldn't have such a short piece because Karen

209
00:14:39.851 --> 00:14:44.380
milked you today.
Karen is a fucking slut.
Get the fuck out of here.

210
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.000
Well,
because we,

211
00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:53.000
Karen and Bobby made sweet love this morning and the 10 minutes we had before.

212
00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:56.990
Yeah,
Ellis went down and then the nanny shows up.
So we have nice,

213
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.940
sexy 10 minute window to get married.

214
00:14:58.941 --> 00:15:03.941
11 and it's glass glass all day and you finished.

215
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.320
And I was like,
Bobby,
I love you.
And you're like,
I love you too.
I'm like,

216
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:12.260
Bobby doesn't say that.
Say that.
It doesn't say that.
What is Bobby say?

217
00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:19.130
Go.
Oh No.
You said,
what are you doing tonight?
And then Bobby said,

218
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.230
right,
there's this girl.
I'm really into,
like Bobby says,

219
00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:29.000
hurtful things right to her face because I'd be like,
well no date.
You,

220
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.180
you know what was going to true Bobby fashion though.

221
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.180
You didn't brush your teeth for me this morning,
which was nice.

222
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.200
I felt like you were in character.
You know it took you to pound town too.

223
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.600
You really got it
like a pig.

224
00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.470
Unless she purples.
You know what I noticed about my purples?

225
00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.990
What they change color.
Like when I'm just like,

226
00:15:53.991 --> 00:15:55.430
I get undressed for a shower.

227
00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:00.800
Then there are the normal color and then I get in the shower and I get cold and

228
00:16:00.801 --> 00:16:05.380
then now they turn purple.
That makes sense.
It's so weird.
Right,
is affecting,

229
00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:10.750
you know,
capillaries,
blood vessels.
Yeah.
Yeah,
sure.

230
00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:15.860
Does that happen to you and your test to purple?
Purple,

231
00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.820
but there's some rebels.
See,
you see different cues sometimes.

232
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:26.060
I've seen purple balls before.
Yeah,
I mean then there's blood rushes obviously,

233
00:16:26.061 --> 00:16:30.610
so things can change color.
I have.
I've had boyfriends where it's,

234
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:36.110
it's all skin,
like a lot of skin and then the two beans,
like the two balls,

235
00:16:36.111 --> 00:16:39.800
but then like so much skin.
Why is that skin underneath?
Yeah,

236
00:16:39.801 --> 00:16:44.801
like I know the bag is enormous and then the two beans are just floating up.

237
00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:49.670
You've had big ball boyfriends and where you're talking about what you're saying

238
00:16:49.671 --> 00:16:53.760
that their bag just hangs low.
Yeah.

239
00:16:55.670 --> 00:17:00.670
I one boyfriend who's Peter was like real short and fat and then has nuts.

240
00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.430
We'll just hang super low.
Yeah,
that's pretty standard.

241
00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:09.590
You're not a lot of times hang lower.
Sure.
When you're relaxed and warm.
Yeah.

242
00:17:09.591 --> 00:17:13.930
I know that they just drew,
but you're saying,
but it was like abnormal.

243
00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.380
It was his name not telling you that.
Why?
Oh,

244
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:19.220
why am I going to embarrass somebody in real life?
No Way.

245
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:22.610
They're not going to find it.
I've got too much respect for the men in my life.

246
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.330
Really?
One like you.
I'm not indiscriminate about who I allow mash,

247
00:17:27.331 --> 00:17:32.120
genitals,
mashed.
How was he a lover?
Okay.

248
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:35.930
How were not great?
I mean not nothing to get married over.

249
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:41.110
Did he ever try to put the dog in the bathroom?
Oh,

250
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.950
nobody's tried that with me.
Did he do a face squat?

251
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:50.100
Remember when you used to joke about that more?
The pile driver used to pretend

252
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.210
<v 3>to give me a pile driver.
That was fun.
That was fun.
I remember.
Yeah,</v>

253
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.530
we do that a lot.
Like when you first started dating.
Yeah.
That's neat.

254
00:17:57.531 --> 00:18:01.140
Why did you drop that?
I'll,
I'll bring it back.
Bring it back tonight.

255
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.950
Do you think people really do that or that's just important?
Uh,

256
00:18:04.951 --> 00:18:08.490
I think people really do it,
but I think,
you know the pile driver.
Yeah.

257
00:18:08.491 --> 00:18:09.690
But I mean I don't,

258
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.450
I don't think it's part is like someone's lovemaking repertoire.

259
00:18:12.451 --> 00:18:17.310
I think it's something that,
you know,
it's like a special special or it's,

260
00:18:17.311 --> 00:18:20.970
you know,
people are on coke and they're like,
let's just do this.
Right.

261
00:18:20.971 --> 00:18:24.150
Cause I don't,
I feel like that's not a every day.
No,

262
00:18:24.151 --> 00:18:27.180
it's not like we're kind of just cooking up to this,
you know,

263
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:32.400
like when you have 10 minutes to do it before the nanny gets in.
You don't,

264
00:18:32.401 --> 00:18:37.260
hold on a second.
Okay.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hello?
Dad's getting mad.

265
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.100
Oh Man.
Red Ban me blue bag.
Cut this part together.

266
00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.020
Watch the rage build.
Hold on.
I'm just a

267
00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:49.950
<v 4>trying to see where the hell is this thing.
Here we go.
Okay.
We're back.</v>

268
00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:51.960
I'm going to do a police ride along.

269
00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:54.303
<v 6>Okay.</v>

270
00:18:59.050 --> 00:18:59.883
<v 7>Hello?</v>

271
00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:01.713
<v 6>Hello.</v>

272
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.240
<v 4>Oh,
that's great.</v>

273
00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:16.860
<v 6>Perfect.
Okay,</v>

274
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:17.783
that's perfect.

275

All right,

277
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.810

Anyways,

278
00:19:30.811 --> 00:19:34.500
I'm going to do a police ride along tonight.

279
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.890
So the phone call was,

280
00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:42.180
And I said No.
And they said can you come in a couple of hours?

281
00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:45.620
And I guess I guess so.
And now they just pushed it to later.
Good.

282
00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:50.310
So I'm doing it right along a writer that I've been working with for months now.

283
00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:55.760
We've been working on this police story for a,
uh,

284
00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.420

Yeah.
For the ride along.

290
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:23.570
Like you want to pick a side?
Yeah.
Especially on the fence.

291
00:20:23.571 --> 00:20:26.690
Was he a gang banger?
I was thinking just something loud.

292
00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.000
You attract attention.
Yeah.

293
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:33.940
We'll definitely get something gold in the line of fire is what I want for you.

294
00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:37.430
Like get out of the car a lot.
Yeah.
If you see guns getting pulled,

295
00:20:37.431 --> 00:20:41.180
stuff like that.
You know what?
I bet you're going to see a lot of homeless shit.

296
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.440
Like,
Hey,
there's a homeless dude face down on the floor.

297
00:20:45.441 --> 00:20:48.220
It's going to be a tongue.
It's going to be a homeless,
a lot of mentally ill.

298
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.480
<v 0>I've done two ride alongs before.</v>

299
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:54.160
I've done one in Tacoma to Catalonia and I've done one in Hickory,

300
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:58.780
North Carolina.
Yeah.
And mentally ill,
uh,
drugs.

301
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.680
A lot of vagrant.
And then when I did to come on,

302
00:21:02.681 --> 00:21:07.510
Ya'll come comedy club and I did the ride along there.
I wrote along for,

303
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:12.160
I dunno,
four or five hours.
He dropped me off.
And then when I,

304
00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:14.350
he texted me half hour later,

305
00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:18.850
the next call was a gun gun called guy pulled a gun on the street.

306
00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:24.430
That was the one I missed.
Well,
it's a Monday night,
so there's less drinking,

307
00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:28.800
partying.
It's a good quiet,
but it's the holidays and it's a holiday.

308
00:21:28.801 --> 00:21:32.230
That's when shit goes down.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Interesting.
Well,

309
00:21:32.231 --> 00:21:36.520
you'll have to give us a detailed report.
Yeah,
I'm going to guess homeless.

310
00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:41.010
Homeless.
Yeah.
Gangbangers.
Yeah.
And it,
it,
it and uh,

311
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.250
you guys some gunshots because remember when we lived in the rampart division,

312
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:49.050
don't really know what was that like?
There are gunshots nightly,

313
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:52.300
I would say like once the sun went down and the shit hit the fan,

314
00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:56.110
but helicopter to every night go at night for right along this will,

315
00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.630
this will be a boring right along the middle of the day on a Monday,

316
00:21:58.631 --> 00:22:01.570
three shit happening.
Shit.
Once the sun go down,

317
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:07.940
so I got to pull up at six.
Okay.
And how Hollyweird Hollywood.

318
00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.450
So you gotta leave early?
I'd meet the tree.

319
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:17.230
Yeah.
It's going to be going to be a thing to four oh five there's going to be

320
00:22:17.231 --> 00:22:20.390
traffic.
We're going to look like a couple of boners sitting in that car wide.

321
00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:24.340
I like,
oh no,
you're a boner.
I'm not we,
you mean,
oh,

322
00:22:24.341 --> 00:22:27.730
you and the writer and my writer buddy.
Yeah,
yeah.
Should be fine.

323
00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.820
They will be fun to take pictures.
Uh,
if they allow,
yeah.
Yeah.

324
00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:34.120
I think it might put you behind the Mesh.

325
00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:38.710
Hopefully I get to sit next to some perps.
What are you in for?
Yeah,
no way.

326
00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:44.250
Nah,
they'll
figure out some codes.
You know,
there's four.

327
00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.610
That means everything's good.

328
00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:50.500
I still remember it when I did the ride along 20 years ago in Carolina,

329
00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:55.540
that the guy's car number was one 27 and that his radio call was one 27

330
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.370
accounting.
So when he,
you know,
he picked it out,
he'd go up month 27 county.
Yeah.

331
00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:02.560
And that was the biggie.
Like I still,
it's still burned in my head.
I would like,

332
00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.550
if you wouldn't mind asking for a list of radio codes.
Yeah.

333
00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.010
Because there is an app you can download that's the police scanner app and I

334
00:23:09.011 --> 00:23:11.650
downloaded it when we lived in the Rampart division just to see what was

335
00:23:11.651 --> 00:23:16.190
happening around us and I can pick up on summit.
All right.
When 19 all that.
Yeah,

336
00:23:16.191 --> 00:23:17.590
like you know,

337
00:23:17.591 --> 00:23:21.610
a seven 2010 seven Henry ten seven is arrest.

338
00:23:21.611 --> 00:23:26.350
I know that I tend to is like all good.
I think a to 11 is a,

339
00:23:26.351 --> 00:23:30.760
is code for a robbery,
right?
I don't know.
Everyone knows one eight seven s f a.

340
00:23:30.761 --> 00:23:35.370
R.
T.
F.
A.
R.
T is like a,
I think it's a biohazard.
Yeah.

341
00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.900
Yeah.
A Art t

342
00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.820
faced with the prospect of having his stock taken.

343
00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:45.440
The shopkeepers starts to pull together the cash.

344
00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.170
<v 5>So you've given me,</v>

345
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:53.770
I ain't taking it in that game to try and slow money is money.

346
00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.700
<v 0>Okay.
Gave him,
he's like coins here you go by.</v>

347
00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:02.140
He gave him coins to pay his tax bill,
which in all fairness,

348
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:06.790
you know the English don't have dollars.
Single dollars.
They have pounds.
Yeah,

349
00:24:06.791 --> 00:24:10.510
of course.
Coins,
pound,
pound coins.
But they also have paper.
They do.

350
00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.650
They maybe get them to transfer it,

351
00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:15.430
but this motherfucker gets paid in pound coins is what I'm saying.
Yeah.

352
00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:17.040
For the Dorito someone gives him,

353
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:20.140
and he does have a point when he says money is money,

354
00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:22.600
but he's definitely being a dick.

355
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:25.510
He's making the job a little difficult for the tax man.

356
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:29.190
<v 5>Money is money,
blah blah,
blah,
blah.
Fine.</v>

357
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.930
Given me one English saying Bubba money is money.

358
00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:38.050
It's given me 1010 pounds of shit up to him and trying.

359
00:24:38.051 --> 00:24:42.290
You look so you can pull up 27 pounds,

360
00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:45.230
not painting all this fucking money.

361
00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:51.790
<v 0>So yeah,
you're getting yourself all upset.
Something else happening.</v>

362
00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:56.500
Yeah.
That guy's got it.
Yeah,
you can't.
Uh,
you can't do that.

363
00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:01.420
These are my old teeth.
Those are the Sears.
Um,
yeah.
Photos we took.

364
00:25:01.421 --> 00:25:04.600

But I brought it,

365
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:08.020
we got the new monitor.
I had it adjusted down.
It looks great.

366
00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.980
And then a blue van came here and we throw up the old picture.
Looks really good.

367
00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.980
I'm wearing denim.
I don't think you are,
but I have denim pants on.
Of course.

368
00:25:14.981 --> 00:25:19.030
I didn't want a jacket on.
Really Show my love for the show.
Yeah,

but where is it?
Oh No.

372
00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:36.850
I said car show in their head that they don't say in it in the right place

373
00:25:36.851 --> 00:25:41.110
though.
Yeah.
Um,
do you want to tell them how to say it right or no?
Yeah,

374
00:25:41.111 --> 00:25:44.680
I feel like in it,
like I've heard it just in weird places.

375
00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.900

377
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.720

Good job.

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:17.950

You don't want me.
That's fine.
Just leave it at that.

384
00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.850
Just the ground of how wide go would be good.

Somebody didn't me

I saw God,
I haven't been there in years.</v>

395
00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:06.983
Yeah.

396
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.500
Also used to eat there a lot when we lived in the rampart because it was right

397
00:27:10.501 --> 00:27:14.840
by our old apartment.
Remember you get off that,
that sweet one.
Oh,
one X.

398
00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:19.260
I ran it her and it was right there across from,
uh,
Tommy Burger.
Yeah.

399
00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:23.010
It's real cops hang out there at that Tommy worker,
by the way.

400
00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:28.070
That was a Cobb hangout.
That was,
yeah.
Yeah,
that's right.
That's like a,
it's a,

401
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:32.250
it's a real la institution that I place.
Um,
tell him,

402
00:27:32.251 --> 00:27:35.450
tell him where we used to live your cop and see if you guys can cruise.

403
00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.200
<v 4>He'll probably be like [inaudible] bro,
we can't go there.
I can't,</v>

404
00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.020
they're definitely going to be like,
we're not going there.
Yeah.

405
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:49.710
I told you one time I went to the bank that was just outside of the

406
00:27:50.231 --> 00:27:55.150
neighborhood.
Yeah,
it was down on Wilshire.
Yeah.
And I rode with a sergeant,
LAPD,

407
00:27:55.151 --> 00:27:58.480
sorry,
in the elevator.
So I was like,
I was trying to get an honest answer.

408
00:27:58.481 --> 00:28:00.400
I was like,
what do you think of like this neighborhood?
And he was like,

409
00:28:00.401 --> 00:28:03.790
right here.
Like what?
And then I named our neighborhood like the cross streets.

410
00:28:03.791 --> 00:28:08.110
He was like,
that's terrible.
It's a terrible place.
Really dangerous.
How bad?

411
00:28:08.111 --> 00:28:10.840
He goes,
oh no,
no,
no.
He's like,
I mean there's streets over there.

412
00:28:10.841 --> 00:28:13.210
We won't even drive down the street.
And I was like,
cool man.

413
00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:17.500
You're just screwed if you call nine one one,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was like,
okay,

414
00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:19.630
that's great man.
Um,

415
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:22.080
<v 9>right.</v>

416
00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.510
<v 4>What happened to the,
Hi Mommy.
Thanks jeans.</v>

417
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.890
Is it your mom or your mom's house?
Is this the one that guy,
the guy just did?

418
00:28:28.891 --> 00:28:33.510
Is that Josh almost?
Who just sent that one in?
I'm not sure.
Okay.
Um,

419
00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:37.860
I know it's online.
The cheat sheet there,
right under each other,
right?
Yeah.
Okay.

420
00:28:37.861 --> 00:28:42.300
That one went through
the Mcdonald's one.

421
00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:43.163
Where'd that go?

422
00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:48.550
<v 9>Should be on Chichi.
Yeah,
but it uh,
it's an empty,</v>

423
00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:50.440
it's an empty a thing.

424
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:53.870
<v 3>Ooh,
that's a blue band booboo.</v>

425
00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.870
BLOOB and empty file.

426
00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.090
Uh Oh.

427
00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:04.490
Someone's going to get and the trades taken out of his nest.
Yeah,

428
00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:06.850
<v 4>but this one.
Okay.
This has something in it.
Let's see.</v>

429
00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:12.350
<v 10>It's Mcdonald's.
Mommy,
can I get a cheeseburger?
Actually,
two cheeseburgers.</v>

430
00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:17.000
I make chicken with ranch.
No mail.
Good call.
Good call.

431
00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:20.240
And uh,
a small fry please.

432
00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:25.160
<v 11>And then what else did we take?
A small fry</v>

433
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:32.090
your code.
We're going to be
okay.
Thanks.

434
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.910
<v 4>So ridiculous.
Yeah,</v>

435
00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:37.240
<v 3>it's so funny.</v>

436
00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:41.110
Really warms my heart that people are doing this now across the country.
Yeah.

437
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.010
If we get,

438
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:46.260
<v 0>if we get some international,
uh,
Hi Mommy.
Thanks genes at the drive through.</v>

439
00:29:46.261 --> 00:29:50.770
That would be great.
I really,
really enjoy that.
I know that guy that does the,
uh,

440
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:55.870
the calls.
That's stupid
Molly.

441
00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.020
Thanks genes.
By the way,
Barry,

442
00:29:59.021 --> 00:30:01.510
who makes the barbecue is dropping off that barbecue.

443
00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:04.200
Maybe I could bring the police there.
It's a good idea.

444
00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:07.330
Should I go pick it up with the police because I think those guys would also

445
00:30:07.331 --> 00:30:11.260
want to refer to if you would share the queue permission to share my,

446
00:30:11.261 --> 00:30:13.600
share it with them.
If you,
by the way Barry,

447
00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:18.220
I asked you for that video and um,
you send a still image.

448
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.110
So he did this great call where he did customer service and he,
uh,

449
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.320
Barry did the guy who made that and he,
um,

450
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:29.770
he had the entire conversation with them saying,

451
00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:35.080
and I direct message him to,
uh,
to send it,

452
00:30:35.081 --> 00:30:39.970
but he sent a still image bearing.
Attach the video.
You touched a still image.

453
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:42.910
It was really funny.
So we'll play it,

454
00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:46.840
but you gotta you gotta get it right.

455
00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:50.060
Thanks jeans.
Um,

456
00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:53.500
nobody said anything and we've been doing this for a while.

457
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:56.890
No one's ever said a thing.
Yeah,
we've even done it.

458
00:30:56.891 --> 00:31:00.160
Two waitresses face to face.
Oh,

459
00:31:00.161 --> 00:31:03.760
you used to do it to the Sushi waitress and Redondo.

460
00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:08.940
You would go thanks jeans when she would take her and then you had flirt with

461
00:31:09.161 --> 00:31:11.280
her,
you'd be like,
you look beautiful today.
Thank you.

462
00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:15.550
My favorite thing was to do that cause you were there too.

463
00:31:15.551 --> 00:31:19.090
That's what made it fun because that horse sitting with my wife and I would just

464
00:31:19.091 --> 00:31:20.620
go,
uh,
thanks gorgeous.

465
00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:26.240
But some guys are really good at that though.
I she didn't speak good.

466
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:30.540
My Dad would do that.
Yeah.
My Dad does that shit.
I mean,

467
00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:33.990
I don't know if he does it in front of other kind of generational girlfriend.
No.

468
00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:37.690
Like don't do it with me.
What do you do when he was with your stepmom?
No,

469
00:31:37.691 --> 00:31:42.020
but he would eyeball waitresses.
Hard.
Hardcore,
hard.
Fucking core.
Yeah.

470
00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:46.140
But with me,
he would just flirt.
It was so gross.

471
00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.240
It's nothing's Grosser than watching your dad flirt.
Really?

472
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:54.300
Except maybe hearing your dad talk about his past girlfriends.

473
00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:58.930
Oh my God.
You knows the grossest when your dad was visiting and your mom,

474
00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:03.940
your mom was planning with Ellis and she was on her hands and knees and your dad

475
00:32:03.941 --> 00:32:07.390
turns me and goes and she hasn't been on her hands and knees in a while for

476
00:32:07.391 --> 00:32:10.810
fuck's sake.
And I go,
don't tell your son that you're going to hurt him.

477
00:32:10.811 --> 00:32:12.880
Three scarves.
I don't want to hear that.

478
00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:19.020
I seen her hands and knees and a while.
Really?

479
00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:26.140
He loves,
he loves those.
What it happened.
If I started flirting,

480
00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.700
I don't care.
They won't care.
Right.
They think that we're like swingers.

481
00:32:30.701 --> 00:32:34.150
It will if the woman and does that,
the guy was will think I'm a swinger.

482
00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.390
Most actually it's different the dynamics between men and women.

483
00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:40.400
If you flirt with a guy in front of a guy,

484
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.350
<v 4>yeah.
Most guys go,
I don't want any,
I don't have anything to do with this.</v>

485
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:46.400
Most guys,
yeah.
You know like some of them will flirt back,

486
00:32:46.401 --> 00:32:51.260
but a lot of guys are like w cause guys see that as is,
um,

487
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:54.650
is this woman trying to provoke this guy that she's with?
Oh right.

488
00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.080
They don't mind going to have to fight.
Yeah.
This can be a violent encounter.

489
00:32:57.081 --> 00:32:59.690
Sure.
That's how guys think,
you know,
smart.
Yeah.

490
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:04.130
But some women do roll with it on either side.

491
00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:08.810
Some women that are with a guy like their man flirting,
vice versa.
Yes.
I don't,

492
00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:13.730
I don't flirt.
Whatever,
whatever.
I certainly don't know.

493
00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:17.090
It's so gross and disrespectful.
Yes,
certainly.
I mean,

494
00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:20.630
I've never been on a date or out with someone and been like,
oh,

495
00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:24.440
a flirt with other girls.
You know?
It's so weird.
No,
Bobby Wood.
No.

496
00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:28.400
I remember one time though,
we were on an early date.
You owe me.
Yeah,

497
00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:31.900
and I forget where we were,
but I went to ask,

498
00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:36.410
I got up and asked the server or something and when I came back to you went,

499
00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:38.870
did you just touch her?
And I was like,
what?

500
00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:43.940
And you thought that I leaned down and touched her heart,
her box on her side.

501
00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:50.180
I was like,
oh.
And you're like,
Oh,
I thought you touched her.
I was like,
what?

502
00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:52.970
You probably did?
No,
I didn't.

503
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:55.880
<v 3>You're always,
you're always flirting with all the girls and stuff.</v>

504
00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:58.070
Like you're flirting with our,
our nanny and stuff.

505
00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:03.040
<v 4>Let's talk about that.
I know.
So we had to get her,
you know,
our nannies,</v>

506
00:34:03.041 --> 00:34:07.380
this really sweet lady,
Guatemalan Lady and we um,

507
00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.190
you know,
Christmas is coming.

508
00:34:09.191 --> 00:34:11.740
We've got to get her a gift and it's hard to talk to for,

509
00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:16.420
to shop for someone like that when you go well cause I thought because it gets

510
00:34:16.421 --> 00:34:20.980
cool around here at night you get her like a nice sweatshirt or something,

511
00:34:20.981 --> 00:34:22.750
but then you,
you brought a good point up,

512
00:34:22.751 --> 00:34:26.230
which is then do they feel the obligation?
Right.
Oh I have to wear it.

513
00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:30.400
<v 3>And if it's not her style at all,
then she feels obligated to wear it around us.</v>

514
00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:30.970
And that

515
00:34:30.970 --> 00:34:34.570
<v 4>we went to the department store yesterday and I got the idea,</v>

516
00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:39.630
what about we get her or I get her some panties and a bra,

517
00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:44.620
but like a crotch less one and holes with the nips are,
yeah,

518
00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:48.460
I give it to her and I go,
you let me know when you're wearing it.

519
00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:51.010
You know,
kind of

520
00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:55.370
<v 3>stand over here or I suggested I go make sure they're crotchless panties.
Right.</v>

521
00:34:55.371 --> 00:34:58.120
But I'm the one that suggested,
I would tell her like,
yeah,

522
00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.950
tell me when you're wearing these.
You give it to her.
Yeah.
And you go,

523
00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:02.930
can you tell me a second?
Tell me when you're wearing them.

524
00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:06.680
And then she'd be like,
[inaudible] Mr Town.

525
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.670
He tells me to wear the panties and I'd be like

526
00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:13.790
<v 4>to tell on me,
give me a signal.
And I know what she would do.</v>

527
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:16.580
She would look down and go,
I'm wearing them today.

528
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:24.460
I'd be like,
yeah,
yeah.

529
00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:29.740
<v 3>Could you imagine anything more soul crushing for her?
No.</v>

530
00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:31.690
To work in someone's home with their child and then

531
00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:35.240
<v 4>yeah,
it would be,
yeah,
I have to wear these pants.
It'd be awful.</v>

532
00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:41.180
Where are these panties?
Some people have done that,
I'm sure.
You know.
Yeah,
sure.

533
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:41.770
Yeah.

534
00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:42.161
<v 3>Oh yeah.</v>

535
00:35:42.161 --> 00:35:46.960
I've heard nightmare stories of nannies flirting with the dad and the family and

536
00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:48.950
the family.
Dad and

537
00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:52.720
<v 4>the guy,
I think in West Palm,
uh,</v>

538
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:55.920
who turned out to be like a pedophile,

539
00:35:55.950 --> 00:36:00.930
but he also had kind of a sex ring running through his home,
you know,

540
00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:05.970
bring in different girls and the staff would cry in the interviews.

541
00:36:06.201 --> 00:36:10.020
They're like,
the staff was mortified because he had a full,
you know,

542
00:36:10.021 --> 00:36:14.940
he's a billionaire cleaning stuff and there,
there'll be so sad to be like,

543
00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:17.940
the girl is here to see.
The thing about that is those people need those jobs,

544
00:36:17.941 --> 00:36:18.774
so they never,

545
00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:21.210
<v 3>she needs that.
They need the word,</v>

546
00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:25.380
which is why it's even more messed up if you gave it.
Of course.
So abusive.

547
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:31.480
Yeah.
We even saw,
I'm like,
I made the naughty list this year shirt.
Right.

548
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:35.700
Or just so there's that kind of subtly sexy.
So there's the crotchless panty,

549
00:36:35.701 --> 00:36:40.230
which is an overt,
or you do this subtly inappropriate gift,

550
00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:44.100
which is the t shirt that's like,
naughty,
not nice or whatever.

551
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.860
I'm on the naughty naughty list.
She's like,
man,

552
00:36:46.861 --> 00:36:50.180
maybe he did not understand the words.
You know,
like maybe she doesn't.

553
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:51.270
She's like,
oh,
okay.

554
00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:56.920
<v 4>No,
you know what kind of naughty I'm talking about.
Right.
And she's like,</v>

555
00:36:56.921 --> 00:36:59.730
so religious and sweet.
She would never,

556
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.590
speaking of sexy,
we saw the arrival last night,
that movie,

557
00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:12.280
and I don't want to be a spoiler,
but first of all,

558
00:37:12.281 --> 00:37:14.860
I had the wrong movie in mind.
I thought,

559
00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:19.300
I thought it was the,
um,
the Brad Pitt movie.

560
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:23.620
<v 3>That's not fair because you were like,
I was really excited.
I said was high.</v>

561
00:37:23.621 --> 00:37:27.040
You Go,
oh,
it's a new Brad Pitt movie.
It's,
he's in a war.

562
00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:31.190
I thought it was a thriller,
Love Story.
But anyways,
I'm excited for it.

563
00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:36.620
<v 4>Arrival.
Amy Adams.
So what happens,
by the way,</v>

564
00:37:36.621 --> 00:37:38.620
it's really cleverly written.
I will say,

565
00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:43.430
I don't want to give away the premise totally,
but we can set it up a little bit.

566
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:48.910
She is a linguistics professor and spaceships land on earth and they're trying

567
00:37:51.351 --> 00:37:52.184
to communicate.

568
00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:56.600
They get her to communicate with the aliens.

569
00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:01.510
And upon her first communication with the alien,

570
00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:07.160
they're like,
do you like big dicks?
That's what they say to her.
And she's like,

571
00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:11.750
um,
what?
And then they're like,
what's the biggest tip you've ever had?

572
00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:15.590
And she's like,
she like holds up her fingers.
She was like,
I guess like that.

573
00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.650
And they're like,
is that a boyfriend or a one night stand?

574
00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:23.570
And then she goes back and she tells a CIA and they go,

575
00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.320
what'd you tell him?
And she goes,
I don't know.
And they go,

576
00:38:26.321 --> 00:38:29.950
go back and tell him you like big dicks.
So she runs back and she's like,
I can,

577
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:33.650
I like big dicks and I don't want to give away at where it goes from there.

578
00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.980
But that's kind of the setup.
Don't want

579
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.360
<v 3>to spoiler alert.
We've already given away too much already.
Yeah.</v>

580
00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:44.060
Those aliens want.
Because at first they're like,
we like read Ed's.
Yeah,

581
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:48.250
send us the redhead.
Yeah.
She's like,
oh my gosh,
me.
I get to communicate.
Yeah,

582
00:38:48.251 --> 00:38:49.810
it's pretty neat.
It's pretty cool.

583
00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.300
And it was kind of neat to see how many dicks there were.

584
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:54.940
There was a lot how many she can handle and,

585
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:58.140
but it was neat that they address that early because that's when the problem is

586
00:38:58.141 --> 00:39:03.141
so many of these space movies is they don't address the sexual assertiveness of

587
00:39:03.301 --> 00:39:03.830
the

588
00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:08.090
<v 4>humans or the aliens at any point.
Like in the Martian.
Yeah.</v>

589
00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:10.130
I don't know why you're laughing.
It's true.

590
00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:14.410
<v 3>Right?
How does he masturbate?
Why hasn't he requested pornography?</v>

591
00:39:14.411 --> 00:39:18.100
Are you going to come again?
Yeah.
All those things.
Yeah.
Yes.
You figured out food.

592
00:39:18.101 --> 00:39:22.570
Yes.
You figured out water.
Air,
but what about masterminding?
Yeah.

593
00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:25.180
What about Dick touches and it's good that the aliens,

594
00:39:25.181 --> 00:39:29.590
that's her first order of business.
Yeah,
it's sexual pleasure.
Yeah,

595
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:34.900
but it's so funny because you'd said Brad Pitt was in it and so Amy Adams is it,

596
00:39:34.901 --> 00:39:35.350
and I was,

597
00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:38.540
I still hadn't figured out that this wasn't the movie that you set me up for.

598
00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:42.310
Sure.
And I was waiting for Brad Pitt.
How far into it?

599
00:39:42.311 --> 00:39:45.470
We waiting for him to show up 30 minutes.
It's still like,

600
00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.240
I wonder if the her partner,

601
00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:49.880
the other scientist is going to be Brad Pitt and I'm like,

602
00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.890
and then it's not him in,
Oh okay.
It's definitely not,
this is the wrong movie.

603
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:55.720
And then we both said something like,

604
00:39:55.750 --> 00:40:00.750
Oh this is definitely not as was like that slave movie I was watching 10 you're

605
00:40:00.791 --> 00:40:01.624
just like

606
00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:04.920
<v 4>yeah,
one of your on that one.</v>

607
00:40:04.921 --> 00:40:08.460
You're not forgiven for it because I remember the details so much.

608
00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.870
The is 12 years of slave.
We are,

609
00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:16.050
I got back from Hong Kong.
Right.
And on my way there,

610
00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:20.130
I think I watched this man on the flight.
Yeah.
So we're in Florida.

611
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:23.750
We're about to go on that family trip.
On the cruise.
Yeah.
I'm,

612
00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:26.100
I'm out of my mind cause I have jet lag.

613
00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:28.980
You start watching 12 years a slave.

614
00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:32.940
Either you ordered it or was on HBO or something.
It was on cable.
Yeah,

615
00:40:32.941 --> 00:40:33.720
I was just in bed.

616
00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:38.460
So I watch the first 1520 minutes to eat with you.

617
00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:43.110
And there's this scene and first of all,
the title is 12 years a slave.

618
00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:47.370
There's already,
you know,
you can put together the type of movie it is.

619
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:52.910
And the scene that I pass out on is the scene where in the very beginning though

620
00:40:53.191 --> 00:40:58.191
on a river boat and a slave tries to stop a white man from raping a girl and the

621
00:41:01.201 --> 00:41:02.430
slave stabs him,

622
00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:06.410
kills him and they throw his body off the back of the river boat,
right?

623
00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:10.260
I'm laying next to Christina and she goes,
oh my God.
And I go,

624
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:14.400
just give it a little,
give it a little,
it gets funnier,
right?

625
00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:19.850
Like I'm thinking that it's registering completely that that's not a true

626
00:41:21.331 --> 00:41:26.130
statement.
The next morning I get up and she goes,
that movie wasn't funny at all.

627
00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:28.050
And I was like,
yeah,
I know.
She goes,

628
00:41:28.051 --> 00:41:32.280
I was waiting the whole time for the comedy to start.
I'm like,
really?

629
00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:33.740
What of that

630
00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.950
<v 0>made you think that there would just,
there would be funny stuff.</v>

631
00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:41.530
Maybe that was just like the hard set up.
Like,
you know how um,

632
00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.180
like Quentin Tarantino movies,

633
00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:48.230
like Django and change is a really serious plot,

634
00:41:48.231 --> 00:41:51.950
but there's also comedic moments to break up the tension.

635
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:55.520
And it was right around the time that we were seeing Django.
And I thought,
oh,

636
00:41:55.521 --> 00:41:59.750
well,
maybe this is someone else's attempt at doing like the slave,
the story.

637
00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:00.590
Right.

638
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:04.580
Very few people can pull that off that I was thinking maybe there's a subversive

639
00:42:04.581 --> 00:42:09.100
element to the story and maybe this will get fined all tears.
Gosh,
I know.
I need,

640
00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:13.460
the wife dies.
Everybody dies and he's crying alone.
And I go,

641
00:42:13.461 --> 00:42:14.500
I got to stop watching it.

642
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.590
Maybe not as bad as you'll feel about the arrival.
God,
no,

643
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:24.770
no giveaway here.
But it's a white bummer for sure.
White bummer.

644
00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:28.890
Now white people love thing.
Upset.
No,

645
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:32.270
I was thinking about why it is that white people.
So let,

646
00:42:32.271 --> 00:42:36.200
let's do some other examples.
For instance,
the One were,
uh,

647
00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:39.320
Hilary swank as a fighter.
What's that movie called?

648
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:46.250
Cry.
Cry,
cry.
Babies.
Cry,

649
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:50.540
cry,
don't cry.
Don't cry.
Don't cry.
There's a million of,

650
00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.360
what about the butterfly and the whole thing.

651
00:42:53.361 --> 00:42:58.361
Remember that paralysis and there's always like these babysitting retards and

652
00:42:59.121 --> 00:42:59.841
like,
you know what I mean?

653
00:42:59.841 --> 00:43:04.750
All those things are white people like retarded people and death,
cancer,

654
00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:08.130
dying children.
Um,

655
00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:12.050
poverty and I don't like these fucking white bummer movies.

656
00:43:12.051 --> 00:43:14.550
I don't need to see this shit,
this and this happened.

657
00:43:14.551 --> 00:43:15.830
So then we committed suicide

658
00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:23.490
marking marks in it and the daughter gets captured by a pedophile and murdered.

659
00:43:23.751 --> 00:43:27.800
And then it's about her ghost from the other photos of Clint Eastwood one that

660
00:43:27.801 --> 00:43:32.330
was,
it was a good movie.
I'm thinking of the,

661
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:36.710
she did hers on a book,
the Mystic River.
That's for fuck sake.
Good movie.

662
00:43:36.711 --> 00:43:37.910
But it's still a white bummer.

663
00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:42.770
And I call it white bombers because the awards academy,

664
00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:44.900
they love throwing awards at these movies.

665
00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:52.070
They go and change the category two white bummer of the year.

666
00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:57.270
Like here's the movie that the most white people felt best about being bummed

667
00:43:57.741 --> 00:43:58.850
out about this.
Yes.

668
00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:04.120
And Amy as my cousin loves white bummers like whenever it's the trailer is she

669
00:44:05.511 --> 00:44:10.460
lost her legs and then she can see our daughter died.
He's like,

670
00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:15.350
you want to go see that?
And I'm like,
no,
not at all.
It looks horrible.

671
00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:20.120
And he,
he feels enriched by that.
More depressing the storyline,

672
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:21.620
the better he feels about it.

673
00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:25.140
You know who likes white bombers show business people.
Yeah.

674
00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:31.070
People who have never had real suffering or hardship in their lives.

675
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:33.750
Like let's go watch this so I can access feelings.

676
00:44:33.751 --> 00:44:38.400
I can't normally get enough bummers.
That's what I'm saying.
Life is hard enough.

677
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:40.680
I'm not going,
I don't want to fucking get bummed out at the movie.

678
00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:44.100
I was driving last week and I heard on the radio on the radio,

679
00:44:44.101 --> 00:44:46.440
so imagine I'm not seeing anything driving.

680
00:44:46.441 --> 00:44:50.550
I hear about this kid dying.
Oh my God,

681
00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:54.390
he's five years old and I started crying in the car.
Yeah,

682
00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:57.360
I have to change the station and I just sit there and cry for a while.

683
00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:00.750
But you liked it,
right?
Like that was the most part.
It was horrible.

684
00:45:00.751 --> 00:45:04.200
It fucked up my day.
He died and Santa Claus,
his arms.
Right.

685
00:45:04.201 --> 00:45:07.170
It was a sick kid who's up.
Make a make a wish thing.
No,

686
00:45:07.171 --> 00:45:10.470
that's what I'm saying though.
That 30 seconds of that

687
00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:14.390
bummed me out for the rest of the day.
Well,

688
00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.740
they're going to make a movie out of it.
I don't want to see that movie.

689
00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:20.970
I don't want to see that movie.
I couldn't handle a news blurb about it.
You know,

690
00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:25.200
Meryl Streep's going to play Santa Santa Claus is black,
first of all.

691
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:29.430
I've always believed that.
Of course.
Yeah.
Why?
But why do you think so?

692
00:45:29.431 --> 00:45:31.530
Why do you think he's black?
Um,

693
00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:34.740
just these kids in Florida convinced me when I was in high school.
Seriously?

694
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:39.510
<v 4>Yeah.
Why?
They're like,
of course he's like,
he,</v>

695
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:43.770
they were black and they just told me,
you know,
he,
um,
he,

696
00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:47.030
he's got a lot of swag and sure it takes care of shit.
True.

697
00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:50.340
And he knows how to move true.
He knows how to like,
you know,

698
00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:54.440
get down that chimney even in a difficult way.
I Dunno.
And then they,

699
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.830
they just told me and I just believed it.
Okay.
So I've never,
um,

700
00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:05.270
subscribed prescribed to the notion that Santa Claus isn't black.

701
00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:08.670
He could be.
I think it's gotta be weird.
You know,
when we were walking,

702
00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:10.140
I never thought about it until we had a kid.

703
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:14.010
We were at the mall picking up my Mac book,

704
00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:17.620
<v 0>the worst place on earth right now.
That was horrible.
The wrong mall too.</v>

705
00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:20.810
I forgot about that water.
I'm so hydrated.
Oh yeah.
Wow.

706
00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:24.020
<v 4>We were sitting there and I'm,</v>

707
00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:30.200
<v 0>I saw the Santa Claus Sandy Claus line.
Yeah.
And I saw all these,
uh,</v>

708
00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:35.090
non binaries.
White people.
Yeah.
That was like,
oh,
I wonder for them,

709
00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:38.330
with their children,
if it's weird to go sit in a white guy's lab.
Yeah.

710
00:46:38.331 --> 00:46:41.360
It's terrible.
I would think that if I were them,
I'd be like,
no,

711
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:45.020
let's go get a fucking Chinese Santa.
Right.
Why?
Why no Asian Santa?

712
00:46:45.021 --> 00:46:48.560
I want no black Santa.
Definitely Latino.
Especially in southern California.

713
00:46:48.561 --> 00:46:51.020
There should be a Latino Santa's.
I really do think that.

714
00:46:51.110 --> 00:46:55.730
Now here's my one reason.
Maybe Santa is white.
Yeah.
Hear me out.

715
00:46:55.850 --> 00:47:00.800
Okay.
Uh,
it comes from a European tradition.
Saint Nicholas.
Oh,

716
00:47:00.801 --> 00:47:05.720
okay.
Yeah.
So say Nicole Aneesa,
Hungary,
Saint Nicholas,
you know,

717
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:08.690
that's,
it's a German,
I believe it's a German stuff.

718
00:47:08.691 --> 00:47:12.890
That Nordic tradition is where Saint Nicholas comes from.
Who brings the gifts?

719
00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:17.780
I've got to say,
I would say sometimes you're good.
Now you're good.
Now there's a,

720
00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:22.070
an,
uh,
say a compass.
Yeah.
In Austria.

721
00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:25.340
Who that?
That's a black Santa.
There is a black Santa,

722
00:47:25.341 --> 00:47:30.010
I remember in Amsterdam today with no vert bought me.
It's the black,
yeah,
it's a

723
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.590
<v 3>chocolate and it came back and it was a black Santa.
That's the,</v>

724
00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.650
it's an evil guy who goes against the children.

725
00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:40.210
Memorize what am I my dad growing up?
Yeah.
So no,
the devil,
sorry.

726
00:47:40.211 --> 00:47:44.920
The debatable goes around the village and if you are bad you get whipped with

727
00:47:44.921 --> 00:47:49.540
branches and they do that in Germany and Austria too.
And he's a black guy.

728
00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:52.060
So that's ratios.
Racist as shit obviously.

729
00:47:52.061 --> 00:47:55.360
But well you've only drank once a day of

730
00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.170
<v 9>or she going to make a big deal out of it.</v>

731
00:47:58.070 --> 00:48:02.490
I've already cleared water champ champ for as long as I've known you.

732
00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.780
I mean I've never even seen anybody try to fuck with you or try to take that

733
00:48:05.781 --> 00:48:10.430
title.
I don't even talk about it.
And now just remember the first time I,

734
00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:13.010
you my God,
Phoenix who was on this,

735
00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:17.210
like the standup core and you came up to me,
I said,
sure,

736
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:21.170
I've never seen someone drink so much water during such a short set.

737
00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:25.970
And that was like,
wow,
I was,
I felt connected to you that you like,

738
00:48:25.971 --> 00:48:29.690
that's what you saw and what I recognize is unusual and I just kept drinking and

739
00:48:29.691 --> 00:48:33.530
no one said a word.
He was almost like if you drank one more bottled water,

740
00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:36.470
someone would have to say something.
Yeah,
you are.
You're pounding the water,

741
00:48:36.471 --> 00:48:39.440
but you got to the point where I don't want to show off.
Yeah,
the water down.

742
00:48:39.441 --> 00:48:42.730
But you let them know like you're not fucking around.
Yeah.
So that is,

743
00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:45.560
did you like set out to be the water channel up or is this something that just

744
00:48:45.561 --> 00:48:49.340
happened or you really need to have,
it's like a calling.
It's like,

745
00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:53.480
did you guys set out to be the fucking,
I dunno,
the Yoyo Champ,

746
00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:57.590
you know you don't that 6:00 AM flight.
I'll be walking through the airport like,

747
00:48:57.591 --> 00:49:00.260
dude,
just don't fucking drink for the next hour.

748
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:03.440
So you could sleep on the flight,
but you don't do it.
Usually I can't.
My just,

749
00:49:03.441 --> 00:49:05.790
my overwhelming Harry should consume more water.
Takes it.

750
00:49:05.791 --> 00:49:07.820
But it's a competitive thing too.
Right?
It's also,

751
00:49:07.821 --> 00:49:11.050
you're putting down numbers and you share these online with people.

752
00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:14.630
Sometimes people will ask like how many,
you know,
like what's your record?

753
00:49:14.631 --> 00:49:19.410
And I know for for these in a day,
somewhere in the 50s yeah,
yeah,
true.

754
00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:24.080
Yeah,
right.
It's true.
I can't believe you had Joe lie.

755
00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:27.370
I didn't have Joel.
He brought it up.
He did.
I know.
I didn't say anything to him.

756
00:49:27.371 --> 00:49:28.520
This is coercion.
No,

757
00:49:28.521 --> 00:49:30.980
it's not going to do some investigating and we'll see what happens.

758
00:49:30.981 --> 00:49:35.090
We'll see you and I know like gallon wise it's just over three.

759
00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:40.310
Yeah,
it's a lot of water.
But when someone's brings up,
you know dude,

760
00:49:40.311 --> 00:49:43.720
I know this guy drinks a lot of water.
I go shut the fuck up.
That's what I said.

761
00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:45.410
I go,
shut the fuck up.
I go.

762
00:49:45.411 --> 00:49:47.900
Just stop talking about your fucking shitty friend and a shitty water

763
00:49:47.901 --> 00:49:52.520
consumption.
Yeah,
I know the guy drinks.
Yeah.
My man,

764
00:49:52.521 --> 00:49:56.660
my phone,
he downs like fucking 15 year old bottles of water day,
Bro.

765
00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:00.110
Go call me Ted.
He makes,
he might drink a thousand and a day.

766
00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:04.830
Yeah,
it's true.
He just drinks water and peas.

767
00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:07.190
He drinks water and peace at the same time,
dude.

768
00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:10.130
Sometimes he's peeing while he's drinking.
You don't understand

769
00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.430
and I feel like I should get less cold water champions

770
00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:19.540
on that note,
let's go water champ.

771
00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:24.690
<v 3>Unbelievable.
You listen,
I don't know how you got Joe to participate in this.</v>

772
00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:27.770
He just did it and the machine,
he just did it.

773
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:32.330
<v 0>You must have a coerced him or or bribed him somehow.
Joe,</v>

774
00:50:32.331 --> 00:50:34.910
I forgive you.
I know that you don't know all the facts.

775
00:50:34.911 --> 00:50:36.590
You only know one side of the story.

776
00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:40.760
We're so I'm empty because I've already drank mine.

777
00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:44.960
Such bullshit.
Oh,
we'll give you this though.

778
00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:48.830
I have to be honest with you cause we steam that.
Is that what the champion.

779
00:50:48.831 --> 00:50:53.790
But Dominique is the poster champion.
Look at those shoulders.
Good job,
dummy.

780
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:59.660
She's right.
I have horrible posture.
I don't care.

781
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:05.090
I can't believe you talk Joe into lying like that.
I didn't.
Oh Man.

782
00:51:05.091 --> 00:51:07.040
I'm going to have to talk to him.
You ready for this?

783
00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:17.210
You know what that means,
right?
That's hard.
Knew it's time to do dates.

784
00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:26.240
<v 4>Thanks for drinking my water.
Fucking rude is shit.</v>

785
00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:31.530
You aren't going to drink it anyways.
Don't worry.
Um,
jeans,

786
00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:34.350
daytime dates.
Go ahead.
There's some big stuff I got to announce.

787
00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:35.820
Are you ready for it?
I'm ready.

788
00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:40.450
Of course everybody knows that I'll be in Orlando for the last week of the,

789
00:51:40.451 --> 00:51:45.450
of the month doing new year's at the Orlando Improv.
Um,

790
00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:49.260
then after that I go to Cannes ass shitty and um,

791
00:51:49.350 --> 00:51:50.610
that starts off the new year.

792
00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:55.160
But what I really wanted to tell you guys are the,
um,

793
00:51:56.370 --> 00:52:00.720
the places that are,
are,
you're in a,

794
00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:04.200
in what?
In difficult.
In danger.

795
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:07.260
That's the word I'm looking for in danger of not getting tickets anymore.

796
00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:11.550
Number one is Atlanta.
There's single digit tickets left there.

797
00:52:11.551 --> 00:52:15.810
Only singles meaning you can't buy two tickets together.
So that's done.

798
00:52:15.811 --> 00:52:19.830
And we're not adding a second show.
Atlanta,
I love you.
If you're coming,

799
00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:24.330
you got them.
You're in.
Otherwise you're probably going to miss out a,

800
00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:27.810
that is going to be January 21st,
just to let you know.

801
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:31.860
Mommy Apolis the third show,
it's filling up quick.

802
00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:33.930
Make sure you scoop those tickets.

803
00:52:34.350 --> 00:52:38.760
That is the 29th of January.

804
00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:42.150
Um,
let's see.
Chicago,

805
00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:46.350
the second show is over half sold.
Um,
DC.

806
00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:51.150
Saturday is sold out.
Friday late is almost sold out.
That is in March.

807
00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:53.490
But again,
if you don't get them now,

808
00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:58.410
I'm just letting you know you might totally miss out.
Boston.
Massive,
massive,

809
00:52:58.411 --> 00:53:03.240
huge tits.
That's good.
Uh,
we added a third show at the Wilbur.

810
00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:08.020
That'll be it.
We won't add more.
That's going to be it.
Um,

811
00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:12.180
those go on sale Friday.
If you're listening Friday,

812
00:53:12.181 --> 00:53:17.181
they're going on sale and van Cute cuter British Columbia.

813
00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:22.980
That is nearly sold out.
I don't know if we're adding there.

814
00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:26.280
So if you want to get your tickets,
make sure you

815
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:29.910
<v 0>do Portland,
Portland,
Oregon.</v>

816
00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:33.420
We sold out in April,
so we added a second show.

817
00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:36.810
Make sure you scoop them before they're gone.

818
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:39.900
We can only do two in Portland,
Oregon.

819
00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:44.460
So there will be no added third show there.
Um,

820
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:49.940
genes.
Go ahead and let them know February 12th.
Oh my God.

830
00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:27.910
So that's what's 2017 is doing it.

Yeah,

831
00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:36.190

I'm good.
But February 12th guys get your 12 your tickets now.

832
00:54:36.191 --> 00:54:39.140
A big one.
I love doing it.
Live.
Live.

833
00:54:39.141 --> 00:54:43.110
It is the like this mash up of the show.
Yeah,

834
00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:45.180
the audio and it's like we're,
you know,

835
00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:48.750
we're doing a weird version of standup because we're playing to a live crowd and

836
00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:52.940
you know,
you'd like to take a shit live you far,
you spread your butt cheeks.

837
00:54:54.970 --> 00:54:56.470
<v 9>Um,
so again,</v>

838
00:54:58.110 --> 00:55:03.110
if you want to see Christina go to thousand ranch dotcom and buy some ticket to

839
00:55:04.721 --> 00:55:07.110
see those big mushy purples,

840
00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:10.510
purples.

841
00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:15.280
That's the top dog blog and Nancy eights mushy purples.

842
00:55:16.450 --> 00:55:21.010
She's fun to have.
Tommy,
would you marry your dad,

843
00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:29.620
Tommy,
Tommy,
or did you marry your dad taught me.

844
00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:35.140
Would you marry your dad?
What'd you,

845
00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:38.740
I'm Chattel and Pauline and buy and you can call me.

846
00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:44.670
There you go.
Says what'd you marry?
Your Mom and your dad?
Uh,

847
00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.740
I think I would bury my dad much easier.

848
00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:52.630
It's really never burp.
I'm fucked at the same time.

849
00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:56.680
Could you even say that you live I,
oh no,

850
00:55:56.681 --> 00:55:58.690
you the double pipe classic.

851
00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:05.380
It was so funny.
She's sitting right where you are.

852
00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:07.990
My Dad during them in the middle of it,
it's like,

853
00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:10.630
I know he's not doing what we do,

854
00:56:10.631 --> 00:56:15.220
but clearly you'd realize we're recording audio.
Yeah.
He gets up,

855
00:56:15.221 --> 00:56:19.670
walks out,
opens the door,
gets other people bring like,
what are you doing?
Oh,

856
00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:23.950
I wanted to get them in here and I'm like,
don't you see that recording?
Yeah.

857
00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:27.910
<v 0>I'm like,
what?
Don't you think that'll screw up the audio of it?
Huh?</v>

858
00:56:29.110 --> 00:56:32.320
Nothing.
He was just excited because it's a showbiz thing.

859
00:56:32.321 --> 00:56:36.460
He likes to be in Showbiz.
Do you want to hear Charles?
All of them.

860
00:56:36.461 --> 00:56:40.480
We had a really good time.
That was a good trip.
It was never know with the folks,

861
00:56:40.481 --> 00:56:44.350
man.
I think everyone feels like that.
Right?
You're like Ah yes cause you,

862
00:56:44.351 --> 00:56:45.041
you don't know.

863
00:56:45.041 --> 00:56:49.570
I think it's easier if it's just the three of us without any sister interference

864
00:56:49.571 --> 00:56:53.110
honestly,
and we'll also,
there's a nice buffer with having a child.

865
00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:55.510
That's the best part.
When you have a kid it changes.

866
00:56:55.511 --> 00:56:59.380
The dynamic changes everything,
but it's no longer about the kids.

867
00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:03.700
The two dogs to distract.
Yeah,
it's perfect.
All right,
here's Charro.

868
00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:05.740
Let me see.
I should do it this way.

869
00:57:05.830 --> 00:57:07.570
<v 6>The original mommy,</v>

870
00:57:07.890 --> 00:57:12.570
Mommy's this is child and that just glazing.

871
00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:17.760
Glassing has cued me.
It wasn't glazing.
Can I see what I'm saying?

872
00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:22.910
<v 0>See the whole idea there is that I wrote line reads for them.</v>

873
00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:27.320
Yes,
but especially with her or you just want her to go ahead and read.
Yeah,
no.

874
00:57:27.350 --> 00:57:30.830
Hell,
what is this?
You know,
I don't want her to think too much,
right.

875
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:32.090
Just just glass.

876
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:36.420
<v 6>Just glass.
Can I start again?
Okay.
What's up?
Bleeding Mommy's.</v>

877
00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:40.620
This is chart and I'm just glazing glass instead.
Again,

878
00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:44.080
what sub?
Lethal Mommy's man,

879
00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:49.170
this is Chad and I'm just glassing is part one up and pass it around cause I

880
00:57:49.171 --> 00:57:53.850
want to kiss this guy.
I'm Cherile,

881
00:57:54.210 --> 00:57:57.100
I'm Poli and MB I you can call him neat.

882
00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:04.700
Oh that's okay.
We'll leave it Pauline.
Pauline Callie and by,

883
00:58:05.370 --> 00:58:07.890
okay.
So again,
I'm Pauline and B.

884
00:58:08.070 --> 00:58:11.520
I'm CIARA and Pauli and buy and you can call me

885
00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:15.320
<v 0>sir.
That's good for her.
Right.
So good.</v>

886
00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:21.580
<v 6>I don't have time for norm by Knowlura bullshit.</v>

887
00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:23.650
Nonbinary she was supposed to say

888
00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:27.440
you had a guy or again,

889
00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:31.810
I'm both or you can kiss my ass like I don't talk like that.

890
00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:38.860
I have to be honest with you.
Christina is the what?
The champion.

891
00:58:38.861 --> 00:58:42.730
But Tommy is the poster champion.
Look at those shoulders.

892
00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:45.990
Good job to it's hilarious poster.

893
00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:51.020
You have never unknown on come Tommy.

894
00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:56.230
If you have never burp or Fart at the same time,

895
00:58:56.950 --> 00:59:01.950
cause you even say that you have leave [inaudible] the doble pipe classic.

896
00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:09.790
Do.
Um,
can you even say that you don't gain,

897
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:12.010
she so disgusted with it.

898
00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:15.580
If you have never burp and Fart at the same time,

899
00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:19.580
you even say that you live I own,

900
00:59:19.581 --> 00:59:21.650
are you the double pipe classic?

901
00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:25.580
<v 0>I honor you.
I honor you.</v>

902
00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:30.350
The double punches go to Tom segura.com and click on the store.

903
00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:33.670
I get some of the new Shit Dj,

904
00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:36.440
that tongue mouth the water champ.

905
00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:41.060
Just glass in all the Chet is fire dog.

906
00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:46.800
I can't believe what I'm saying.
So she doesn't realize it til afterwards.

907
00:59:46.801 --> 00:59:50.290
So that's,
that's the key to it.
Just get her to [inaudible] she was like,
wait,

908
00:59:50.291 --> 00:59:54.410
what did I do?
That's the best part that she also doesn't know slang.

909
00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:55.730
She doesn't know.
Wait,

910
00:59:55.731 --> 01:00:00.731
remember when we went out to dinner the first night they were here and she

911
01:00:01.271 --> 01:00:06.080
worked track suit,
which I admire actually.
I really have.

912
01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:09.620
It's funny to see her in it though.
Cause people are like,
you're an athlete.

913
01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:14.990
But remember when we were at dinner and I was talking to your dad about his

914
01:00:14.991 --> 01:00:19.190
bands and she was getting so upset,
she doesn't like it.

915
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:20.810
And so disgusting.

916
01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:25.190
But you were saying the key is to add genuinely interested.

917
01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:28.990
The more that you're like,
oh that's neat.
She's like please,

918
01:00:28.991 --> 01:00:33.440
like she gets bothered by the fact that you're having a real conversation about

919
01:00:33.441 --> 01:00:37.820
it and that shit.
Cause if you're joking,
part of her is like,
well this is a joke.

920
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:42.320
If you're serious,
it bothers her more as,
what was I asking her dad?

921
01:00:42.321 --> 01:00:46.040
I forget how well how I got away with her because we did a long commerce,

922
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:50.060
I forget,
but you did it real sincere.
Right?

923
01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:53.610
I was top dog way.

924
01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:57.410
He would answer very sincerely and that bothers her more.
She's like,

925
01:00:57.411 --> 01:00:59.840
well you know,
thinking of them eat shit and it's there.

926
01:01:00.110 --> 01:01:04.770
You got to really well cause he goes to ne was a travel day,
messes it all up.

927
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:07.780
Messes gets up.
She's like,

928
01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:11.570
please remember when the waitress came to the table.

929
01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:14.450
Oh yeah.
He's like,
Oh I didn't tell you who died.

930
01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:18.830
And she started laughing so hard.
Waitress heard him.

931
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:21.740
I didn't think it had a personality because that's our second time having her

932
01:01:21.741 --> 01:01:24.740
ass.
And he goes,
I didn't tell you died.
That's what he said.

933
01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:27.140
I didn't tell you who died and she goes,

934
01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:32.960
because your dad loves talking about Shit and death was my cousin.

935
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:34.160
He said it with a smile.

936
01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:39.860
He was real happy about it.
Yeah,
pretty good.

937
01:01:43.550 --> 01:01:47.570
<v 6>I remember one time my friend say,
will you marry him your song?</v>

938
01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:51.330
And I said,
no,
because that's not my zone.

939
01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:03.200
I remember one time my friend said,
would you marry your son?
And I said,
no,

940
01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:05.620
because that's my son.
Oh,
okay.

941
01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:12.230
I remember one time my friend said,
would you marry your song?
And I said,

942
01:02:12.231 --> 01:02:14.000
no,
because that's my song.

943
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:18.920
<v 0>Because we were of course playing off of the,
I was like,</v>

944
01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:20.280
would you ever date your mom

945
01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:31.260
<v 6>Nafsa
God's face?
Is it still my man?</v>

946
01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:32.460
That's what's up.

947
01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.580
Don't forget to go to your mom's house,

948
01:02:38.581 --> 01:02:42.660
podcast.com and it's still work shop.

949
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:48.430
And then she had a stroke.
I don't know what was going on there without

950
01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:54.940
slurp
shop.

951
01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:57.213
He's

952
01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:05.700
leaving at Hilton.
Just walks out

953
01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:08.980
keeping needs to be bad.

954
01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:13.980
He probably needs to pee pads then because they,
what do I say?

955
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:15.480
Don't forget to go to your mom's house,

956
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:22.860
but it doesn't take glamazons through their second page.

957
01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:26.620

959
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:36.360
Why are they coming here?

960
01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:42.930
He was excited.
Oh,

Nothing.

961
01:03:42.931 --> 01:03:45.780
Nothing registered.
Hey,

963
01:03:54.810 --> 01:03:57.470
Don't forget to go to your mom's house,
but

964
01:03:59.650 --> 01:04:04.230
I ain't show up through the Amazon banner ad.
Every time you buy some shit,

965
01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:05.820

968
01:04:24.391 --> 01:04:28.920

969
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:34.760

01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:43.540

Whoa.

971
01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:57.140
Realize that everybody in the room knows you'd had that come and get tickets to

972
01:04:57.811 --> 01:05:01.110

Life may be after the show.

973
01:05:01.111 --> 01:05:04.810
You can click his bat whole click that.

974
01:05:04.811 --> 01:05:06.250
What is it?

975
01:05:08.130 --> 01:05:10.490
I have no one to say that.

976
01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:15.400
Oh well yeah,

977
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:20.380
go to the and branch.com and get tickets to see Christina perform live.

978
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:24.700
She bring balls of her tits.
It's pretty good.

979
01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:28.590
She thought by so now

980
01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:36.960
I can talk like this.
Why don't you put your fire to do this system?

981
01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.430
No,
I don't use that word know,
but it's great.

982
01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:46.750
[inaudible] hello?
Come on.
You have to say fuck boy.

983
01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.520
No fuck boys.
Hello.

984
01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:53.770
<v 9>Hey Kid.
Did you like youtube?</v>

985
01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:59.210
Hey Hitler do like loot.
I love stamps.
I got some promo stuff.

986
01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:00.073
There you go.

987
01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:02.930
<v 6>She's all,
what do you see?
So</v>

988
01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:12.450
Tommy,
would you marry your mom
told me,

989
01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:18.210
gave me a movement.
What?
Please tell me some sad stuff.

990
01:06:18.490 --> 01:06:22.890
My preferred pronoun is the regional mommy.
Oh,
there you go.

991
01:06:22.891 --> 01:06:24.610
She is the lesson.

992
01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:29.140
<v 9>Okay,
go ahead.
Say it in the mic.</v>

993
01:06:30.890 --> 01:06:33.760
What is glassing?
Glassing is like a,

994
01:06:33.850 --> 01:06:37.930
it's either looking through binoculars or just chilling,
like just hanging out.

995
01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:42.820
Can you also say that I don't use the airport please.
You want me to say that?

996
01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:47.380
Yeah.
Say that.
I don't use the airport as uncomfortable.
Okay.

997
01:06:49.650 --> 01:06:53.860
Shit.
I love you.
I love you too.
You did a great job.
Really a great job.

998
01:06:53.890 --> 01:06:57.370
You know what?
It really bummed me out.
Can I get paid for this?
Yeah.
Okay.

999
01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:02.030
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Dad Do some too.
Okay.

1000
01:07:03.610 --> 01:07:05.140
She,
uh,
I recorded her,

1001
01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:09.130
then I recorded him and a total fucking amateur move.

1002
01:07:10.330 --> 01:07:14.950
I turned,
I stopped recording,
started doing shit,
you know,
then they start talking

1003
01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:19.450
and I come in,
I come in a little late,

1004
01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:24.250
but he's telling her the Orlando Airport Story.
No,
no,
but I get part of it,

1005
01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:28.720
but then I stopped again and now I'm like,
okay,
we're done.

1006
01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:32.980
She's sitting on the cash behind you and she has a 22nd fart.

1007
01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:36.080
<v 6>No.
And you know what,
if we had the farm,
yeah,</v>

1008
01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:39.360
<v 9>Mike,
we would have heard it or justify the,
here's the lesson by the way,</v>

1009
01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:43.110
if you're ever it here.
Yeah.
And someone like that.

1010
01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:46.590
Somebody in the room just leave the mic so you just leave and recording the

1011
01:07:46.591 --> 01:07:50.780
entire time.
It was so I was so bummed out about it.
Um,

1012
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:56.130
cause top dog,
it just in a minute like I'm done,
I'm going to just trying to,

1013
01:07:56.850 --> 01:08:01.120
you know,
clean up these files or whatever and then I just turn up that night.

1014
01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:04.410
<v 8>I had to throw my underwear away because he got it.</v>

1015
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.860
He could wear it and some of them got into my trousers here again,

1016
01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:13.650
so I had to get on the plane and fly with a little,

1017
01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:19.640
oh my goal.
His pants.
Yeah.

1018
01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:24.470
So that was a funny story.
No,
nothing I could do that'll go home.

1019
01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:28.940
Can you have a car car?
But he had to sit on the plane with Gaga on the pants.

1020
01:08:28.941 --> 01:08:30.530
So I thought,
yeah,

1021
01:08:31.330 --> 01:08:33.530
this wasn't a big deal for the person that sat in there after me.

1022
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:36.880
Imagine you said after that you're sitting in his shit.
Oh,

1023
01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:43.190
uh,
okay.
Can you have some glass in your show?

1024
01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:44.413
There is class.

1025
01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:56.600
There's um,
there's a lot of songs about that.

1026
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:59.390
You know that a lot people make songs about it.

1027
01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:06.500
<v 9>Holy Shit.
That was on your show.
Uh,
oh.</v>

1028
01:09:07.210 --> 01:09:10.450
<v 0>So funny to hear her get mad.
It's my new favorite.
It is fun,
right?</v>

1029
01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:17.080
You guys are discussing,
she gets so mad at us talking about it.

1030
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:20.440
We talked about farting,
shinning peeing so much.

1031
01:09:20.441 --> 01:09:21.810
You know what your dad really liked,
right,

1032
01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:25.510
is when we talked about how we yellow on each other's yellow.
Yeah.
He goes,

1033
01:09:25.511 --> 01:09:29.070
I like to let my,
my piece sit there too.
And then my mosaic,

1034
01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:31.590
he'll pee like five times and not flushed and we brought,

1035
01:09:31.630 --> 01:09:33.780
we were real proud about that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1036
01:09:33.830 --> 01:09:37.250
I think Tom and I do want to hear his line reads.
Yeah,
I got him to do some too.

1037
01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:40.310
<v 9>These lines</v>

1038
01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:46.333
here.

1039
01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:48.550
<v 0>Your mom had a bout of diarrhea.
Is that,</v>

1040
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:52.760
maybe that may be why she had a 22nd part.
Yeah.
Shit.
Diarrhea.
That's true.

1041
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:55.970
It was such a big fart though.
Yeah.
So upset.

1042
01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:02.630
<v 9>Something funny.
Okay.
Top dog line reads.</v>

1043
01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:09.800
Read the title.
Yeah.
Total dad jokes.
Dad Boehner.
Yeah,

1044
01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:14.720
so the top of the page that I hand him,
it says top dog line reads.
Right.

1045
01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:23.420
Something funny.
Okay.
Top dog line reads.

1046
01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:29.280
I could not put dummy.
You know,
I love my cheese.

1047
01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:34.940
This is top dog and I just farted.
It smells bad,

1048
01:10:34.941 --> 01:10:36.350
but at least I know what's coming.

1049
01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:41.780
There's no feeling like killing the enemy.
Well,

1050
01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:47.000
there's keeping the lady life for a week in my basement barrier in a field,

1051
01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:51.140
but still the enemy is the enemy
is good.

1052
01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:55.820
I remember when I farted in Burp at the same time,
like remember my first kiss,

1053
01:10:56.510 --> 01:11:00.530
actually,
it all happened on the same day.
He's laughing through his lines.

1054
01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:04.070
That's why a lot of people burp and Fart or Fart,
then birth.

1055
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:07.010
But when you do them at the same time,

1056
01:11:07.190 --> 01:11:11.750
that's magic that it's a double pipe.
Classic.
Nice.

1057
01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:15.450
It's good.
Go to [inaudible] dot com and click on the store.

1058
01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:19.800
Buy stuff from my buddy Tommy.

1059
01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:24.930
Would you marry your dad?
I'm just glass.
Glass,
glass,

1060
01:11:24.931 --> 01:11:25.860
glass all day.

1061
01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:32.090
Go to a thousand ranch dotcom and buy some tickets to see those big mushy

1062
01:11:32.101 --> 01:11:37.020
purples.
I have a big announcement.
I'm Polly.

1063
01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.870
I'm bi.
I'm married a squirrel.

1064
01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:45.420
Would you like to come to the wedding coach of the Orlando Airport Terminal B

1065
01:11:45.450 --> 01:11:49.380
gate 55 men's through third install on the left.

1066
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:51.620
That's where I left my trousers.
Okay.

1067
01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:56.820
<v 0>See now the reason that charros laughing is she thinks that it's a a made up</v>

1068
01:11:58.210 --> 01:12:02.710
that right.
And that's why afterwards she goes,
I thought it was a funny story.

1069
01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:07.330
I didn't realize it's true.
Yeah.
So yeah,
that's why you're seeing the,
um,

1070
01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:10.030
the laughter is because,
oh,
this is made up.

1071
01:12:10.690 --> 01:12:14.890
But once she's horrified later or when I played earlier is because she realizes

1072
01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:15.733
it's true.

1073
01:12:16.630 --> 01:12:21.600
<v 9>Okay.
You got that.
I need you to do the Tommy,</v>

1074
01:12:21.601 --> 01:12:25.350
would you marry your dad line again and,
and that one you just did again.
Okay.

1075
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:28.680
Tommy,
would you marry your dad?

1076
01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:32.890
<v 0>He sounds so serious.
That's my favorite part.
Funny Tommy.</v>

1077
01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:38.020
Cause he's bad at acting,
which is where it's so funny.
Yeah.
But he's too eager.

1078
01:12:38.050 --> 01:12:42.790
Like your mom,
her reluctance is what makes her hilarious.

1079
01:12:42.791 --> 01:12:46.300
Your Dad wants to be in Showbiz.
Yeah.
And that's why it's,
it's like different,

1080
01:12:46.301 --> 01:12:49.390
it's different.
I wouldn't say it's,
it's just different.
No,
that's,

1081
01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:54.080
you nailed the analysis of why one works better.
Yeah.

1082
01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:58.690
Comedically.
Yes.
But his reads are so flat.
It's funny,

1083
01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:01.600
but that one actually,
that's the one,

1084
01:13:01.630 --> 01:13:04.660
the reason that's the funniest is because I think he delivers that line the
best.

1085
01:13:04.690 --> 01:13:08.920
Right.
Because to him,
he,
he,
he,
he actually married your dad.
He doesn't know why.

1086
01:13:08.921 --> 01:13:12.540
That's funny.
And that's why it's funny because he's reading it sincerely.
Right.

1087
01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:14.320
Or something.
What'd you marry your dad?

1088
01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:19.300
He's saying it like it's a real thing to ask me.
Yeah,
that's good.
They did great.

1089
01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:23.940
<v 9>Just do it again.
Okay.
Tommy,
would you marry your dad?</v>

1090
01:13:25.530 --> 01:13:30.030
Go to the lender and Bart and I repair for it.
Go to Lando,
Eric.
Okay.

1091
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:33.270
Go to the Orlando Airport.

1092
01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:37.140
Terminal B gate 55 men's room.

1093
01:13:37.650 --> 01:13:41.400
Third Stall on the left.
That's where I left my trousers.

1094
01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:47.700
I am the fart master.
I fart.
I shit.
And I teach.

1095
01:13:48.690 --> 01:13:53.350
I love stamps.
All this good buddy.
Okay,
good.

1096
01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:54.050
Yeah,

1097
01:13:54.050 --> 01:13:57.630
<v 0>he,
um,
he wants to be,
uh,</v>

1098
01:13:57.950 --> 01:14:01.160
an actor or yeah.
Yeah,
but I like it.
He,

1099
01:14:01.161 --> 01:14:05.870
he's the best when he's not trying hard,
which is the best one.
He sincere,

1100
01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:09.380
but that's so hard for him to do.
Right.
That's why the phone calls,

1101
01:14:09.650 --> 01:14:11.710
I used to call my dad and go,

1102
01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:16.150
I'm going to call you in 10 minutes for the shower for my show.
Right.

1103
01:14:16.151 --> 01:14:19.540
And if you listen to the old phone calls,
not early,
early,

1104
01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:22.710
but once he realized people were listening.
Yeah.
I told him like,
oh,

1105
01:14:22.711 --> 01:14:24.580
all these people are saying I liked to call with you.

1106
01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:27.550
Then there was a period where he was like,
oh,

1107
01:14:27.551 --> 01:14:32.110
and he would like be all prepped and that's when I started to call him from a

1108
01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:35.950
like a different line.
Yeah.
So that he would just answer.
I go,
Oh,
Hey dad.
He,
oh,

1109
01:14:35.951 --> 01:14:38.320
what's up buddy?
Yeah.
So when you hear him answer like that,

1110
01:14:38.770 --> 01:14:42.730
basically the last few years,
it's because he just thinks I'm calling to say hi.

1111
01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:46.810
Yeah.
It's definitely more natural.
Yeah.
You got to catch them off guard.

1112
01:14:47.410 --> 01:14:50.080
Got To catch them off guard.
Yes.
Chairs are so fucking uncomfortable.

1113
01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:55.190
I'm just trying to get comfortable.
I know,
man.
I know.
That's right.

1114
01:14:55.210 --> 01:14:57.010
He did a really good job.
They both did a really

1115
01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:57.953
<v 12>great job,</v>

1116
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.863
people,

1117
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:12.060
but you should have no fucking problem.

1118
01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:18.700
<v 0>Wow.
That's funny.
What does she want?
I don't know where she is.</v>

1119
01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:22.230
<v 12>Make it easy for you.
Fucking get on</v>

1120
01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:28.980
your menu up there,
then take it off the menu.

1121
01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.090
It's not available.

1122
01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:38.750
<v 0>Wow.
That's um hm.
I think we have to subway people.</v>

1123
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:43.580
Oh yeah.
Because let's see.
This one says,
sounds like Maria went to subway.

1124
01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:49.430
She's losing her shit and then I swear there's another one.

1125
01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:54.290
There's another one.
She's got hungry,
but she does,
that's all hungry.

1126
01:15:54.410 --> 01:15:58.820
Uh Wow.
There's a,
there's multiple.
Let me see if there's another subway.

1127
01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:04.280
I feel like there's another subway.
But you're freaking out at the subway.

1128
01:16:04.281 --> 01:16:08.770
Employees like,
dude,
you're not the four seasons relaxed.
I know,
right?
God,

1129
01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:11.180
people get so mad about that shit.

1130
01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:15.670
Poor person just is working at subway.
Yeah.

1131
01:16:15.930 --> 01:16:20.420
Just trying not to throw up every day,
smelling that shit.
No.
It also,

1132
01:16:20.421 --> 01:16:22.040
so I don't like subway anymore.

1133
01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:25.680
<v 13>I don't give a fuck about none of that.
I'm spending money.</v>

1134
01:16:25.681 --> 01:16:27.050
You going give me what I asked for.

1135
01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:32.590
That's why I'm special to you.
I'm special to you

1136
01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:34.223

1139
01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:47.360
We can get it cause I'm a real Nigga.

1140
01:16:47.690 --> 01:16:52.340
<v 0>Whoa.
Jeez.
You know when someone's voice trembles too.
It's so much rage.</v>

1141
01:16:52.341 --> 01:16:55.760
She's mad.
Oh yeah,

Gentleman.
Just something else is going on.
Okay.

1142
01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:58.360
<v 13>Hey this Nigga,

1143
01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:01.873
Come on.

1144
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:09.440
I'm like Yo Mama for having Yo ass.

Yes ma'am.

1147
01:17:20.121 --> 01:17:22.340
I wanted them all in the oven.
Hilarious

1148
01:17:23.170 --> 01:17:27.220
<v 0>man.
Is it subway like the nastiest now when you look at it,</v>

1149
01:17:27.221 --> 01:17:30.760
I used to eat that shit on the road and it's so fake.
Like the meat is totally,

1150
01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:35.710
it's not good.
I mean sucks.
Even the lettuce is frozen.

1151
01:17:36.010 --> 01:17:40.390
Sometimes they'll have like ice on it.
When you're doing fast food options,

1152
01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:45.640
what's the better?
We've all driven through nowhere and been like,
all right dude.

1153
01:17:45.641 --> 01:17:48.930
At least I can get spinach and avocado on some shit,
you know

1154
01:17:51.450 --> 01:17:54.390
<v 13>and all my other sandwiches because I was having for</v>

1155
01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:56.933
no,

1156
01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:02.800
just stop talking to me while I'm talking to her professional bitch ass Nigga

1157
01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:07.660
and I'm gonna show you that tomorrow.

1158
01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:09.510
<v 0>Okay.
Wow.</v>

1159
01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:14.360
<v 13>But when y'all clothes I said Yo punk ass when you get off o Si yo bitch ass</v>

1160
01:18:14.361 --> 01:18:19.350
when you get off,
I'm going to see the same attitude.
Is that a kid with her?
No.

1161
01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.193
You bring up.

1162
01:18:22.770 --> 01:18:25.980
Same thing you just put on everything else.
That's too much lettuce.

1163
01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:30.880
<v 0>She's able to go back and forth though.
That's kind of the impressive one.
Yeah,</v>

1164
01:18:31.810 --> 01:18:33.050
right.
She didn't lose her

1165
01:18:33.150 --> 01:18:36.870
<v 13>cool that much.
Nothing ass Nigga bitch</v>

1166
01:18:45.550 --> 01:18:47.890
call my mother fucker.
Why you talking?

1167
01:18:47.891 --> 01:18:52.630
Shit so he could come at you.
Right?

1168
01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:05.890
<v 0>It's so intense and then she's going to be like Mayo.</v>

1169
01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:15.040
<v 13>Take some of that later</v>

1170
01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:21.070
because I want to say all I asked you was all Italian.

1171
01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:25.270
I ain't say nothing else to make your job smoother.
I said all sandwiches was

1172
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:38.530
<v 0>not for that.
Well,
let's go back to Maria.</v>

1173
01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:44.880
Maria at subway is a little more default from Chanel with extra names like you

1174
01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:50.590
should have had it available then why is it unavailable?

1175
01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:55.360
I like white people.
Rage over silly things.
More over silly things.

1176
01:19:55.690 --> 01:19:59.740
Over black people rage.
Well,
yeah.
Why?
People getting mad about,

1177
01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:03.310
<v 13>why is it that there</v>

1178
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:09.040
<v 12>everyone looking at it?</v>

1179
01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:14.820
It's not available.

1180
01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:20.060
<v 0>You think she's asking Matt?
I don't know,
but why was the other lady yelling?</v>

1181
01:20:20.850 --> 01:20:23.120
I'm like,
I don't know what started that fight.

1182
01:20:23.121 --> 01:20:25.400
I don't know if she was mad at him at a menu.
That's what I'm saying.

1183
01:20:25.401 --> 01:20:30.401
Because somebody started after it started after the altercation began,

1184
01:20:30.710 --> 01:20:33.380
you know?
Yeah.
See,
I don't know what the other ladies,
man,

1185
01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:34.400
I know that this lady is

1186
01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:36.450
<v 12>mad at something stupid menu.</v>

1187
01:20:52.230 --> 01:20:53.570
<v 0>It is what she does have that</v>

1188
01:20:59.650 --> 01:21:04.650
of,
there's one of be on the menu is a total white chick thing.

1189
01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:09.840
Oh yeah.
This is the white people get mad about shit that does not matter.
Yeah,

1190
01:21:11.010 --> 01:21:12.580
<v 12>and titled to everything.</v>

1191
01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:26.860
<v 0>You know that,
but if you know that,
then don't expect it to be different.</v>

1192
01:21:26.861 --> 01:21:31.480
That's on you do.
One thing that I noticed in both,
uh,
subway scenarios.
Yeah.

1193
01:21:31.570 --> 01:21:35.650
Everybody minds their fucking business.
Yeah.
No one gets involved.
Well,

1194
01:21:35.651 --> 01:21:39.400
who's going to school this woman.
I know,
but it's just funny.
This guy is like,

1195
01:21:39.401 --> 01:21:42.640
I'm not even looking at this woman.
I'm tuning this out.

1196
01:21:43.770 --> 01:21:44.640
<v 12>Crazy person.</v>

1197
01:21:53.890 --> 01:21:55.960
<v 0>Okay,
and what's she,
what's really bothering her?</v>

1198
01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:58.150
It's not that there's something not on the subway menu.

1199
01:21:58.151 --> 01:22:02.590
You know her husband and her fought this morning or she didn't get what she

1200
01:22:02.591 --> 01:22:07.450
wanted somewhere else.
It ain't about the subway folks.
It never is.

1201
01:22:07.451 --> 01:22:08.800
It's never about the sandwich.

1202
01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:12.650
Never about whether they have parmesan cheese now.

1203
01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:14.600
<v 12>None of that shit bothers you.</v>

1204
01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:29.490
<v 0>Jesus.
The pork.</v>

1205
01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:36.053
<v 12>Yay.</v>

1206
01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:45.410
<v 0>Tell who the head office.
Oh,
tell your head office to make it.</v>

1207
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:47.510
I thought she was saying something really different.

1208
01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:51.650
I like this guy.
He's like,

1209
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.450
<v 7>she's losing her mind.
Fucking bullshit.</v>

1210
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:13.790
<v 9>God
over what?
Over.</v>

1211
01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:17.290
<v 0>There's,
there's no bread left for the sandwich.
You want go crazy.</v>

1212
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:21.580
Go to another subway.
We considered that she's lived upstairs for six years.

1213
01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:27.100
That's what she said.
Go.
Don't go to another one.
Call ahead.
Yeah,

1214
01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:31.180
don't eat at subway.
How about that.
Just eat somewhere else.

1215
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:33.790
This guy reminds me of you by the way here.
Okay.

1216
01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:40.600
<v 7>Yeah.
Oh Shit goes,
go,</v>

1217
01:23:40.690 --> 01:23:41.980
go in there and cover it up.

1218
01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:45.383
<v 9>Cat Litter.</v>

1219
01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:54.230
<v 7>He's dry.
He's not speaking.
He's driving.</v>

1220
01:23:54.710 --> 01:23:56.750
I don't want it.
You can't handle it.

1221
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:03.320
Why are you doing?
It's done.

1222
01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:08.630
<v 9>That guy's a Bert body too.
Did you see it
here?
That big old Burt body.</v>

1223
01:24:12.290 --> 01:24:13.160
Why are you upset?

1224
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:16.420
<v 0>Because you know I don't like the Barf in the dry heat.</v>

1225
01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:21.680
<v 9>Yeah,
it was,
um,</v>

1226
01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:23.420
he just couldn't have some people just can't handle it.

1227
01:24:23.450 --> 01:24:27.090
I felt like that during some diaper changes.
No,
for fat.

1228
01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:31.640
Good one.
Yeah.
Good job.
Kid is fat.
That's true.

1229
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:35.670
I'm going to see Bart one tomorrow.
Where at the show were,

1230
01:24:35.671 --> 01:24:36.920
we were both doing the laugh factory.

1231
01:24:36.990 --> 01:24:40.170
<v 0>He's going to be super bummed because you're so much skinnier than he is.
I know.</v>

1232
01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:45.550
<v 9>By the way,
we didn't hear back from Fred the glassine,</v>

1233
01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:49.800
but uh,
we got this video of him slapping a bear.
Cool.

1234
01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:54.180
That's going through a trashcan and he gets so excited and it's also toilets in

1235
01:24:54.181 --> 01:24:56.850
his yard.
You want to see?
It's really amazing.

1236
01:24:59.010 --> 01:25:03.660
What is wrong with humanity?
I don't know who's calling on a,

1237
01:25:04.050 --> 01:25:07.200
God damn it.
I love it.
This is a brand new pooter.

1238
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:12.170
<v 0>Oh my God.
There you are.
Errors on the dumpster.</v>

1239
01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:18.170
Let's try and sneak home.
So this is like his idea of a lot of fun.

1240
01:25:18.171 --> 01:25:22.780
Right?
I wouldn't fuck with a bear.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
Fred.

1241
01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:32.530
<v 2>That's Fred.
Those toilets.</v>

1242
01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:40.170
Oh with awesome.

1243
01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:44.720
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1244
01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:51.070
<v 0>It's crazy.
And there's toilets in his back yard.
Yeah.
And by the way,</v>

1245
01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:54.790
he's in Colorado.
That's where he's from and sure not originally.
Um,

1246
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:56.240
the toilets are

1247
01:25:56.390 --> 01:26:00.270
<v 2>okay.
Y'all come on.
Bear is a Colorado my backyard.
It's</v>

1248
01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:02.190
<v 9>two toilets in his backyard,
by the way,
is Fred?</v>

1249
01:26:02.191 --> 01:26:04.250
My Dad cause would be that excited about that.

1250
01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:08.790
<v 0>The high five really solidifies his position as a dad boner.
Yeah,</v>

1251
01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:10.710
high fiving is just the lamest.

1252
01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:13.250
<v 9>Yeah.
Yeah.
He really loves high fives to</v>

1253
01:26:13.450 --> 01:26:17.290
<v 0>court.
All Dad.
Boners that's what they do.
Real Dad.</v>

1254
01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:23.340
<v 5>Yeah.
It's a real dad noise.</v>

1255
01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:28.280
<v 9>Yeah,
it's pretty good.
Pretty good.</v>

1256
01:26:28.510 --> 01:26:32.320
<v 0>Real dads only.
Ah,
man.
Yeah.</v>

1257
01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:36.790
Real moms don't approve of bad behavior like that.
No real moms.

1258
01:26:36.791 --> 01:26:37.990
They shake their heads,
they go,

1259
01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:40.550
<v 9>by the way.
Um</v>

1260
01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:42.713
<v 14>Mm</v>

1261
01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:46.300
<v 9>Burton,
I Barton I we weigh in in two weeks.</v>

1262
01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:50.840
<v 0>Well,
you're already ahead of the curb.
I know you're so ahead of the curb.</v>

1263
01:26:51.710 --> 01:26:54.470
He's got no chance.
None.

1264
01:26:54.650 --> 01:26:55.670
<v 9>I got a text from this,</v>

1265
01:26:55.671 --> 01:27:00.410
a buddy of mine in Florida who was at the radio station that Burt did on

1266
01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:04.670
Thursday and he goes,
uh,
I think you're going to win.
And I go,
why?
He goes,

1267
01:27:05.150 --> 01:27:08.510
I just gave him,
I just watched him drink six,
um,

1268
01:27:08.570 --> 01:27:13.520
drinks this morning at radio.
He had three breakfast sandwiches and two,

1269
01:27:13.521 --> 01:27:16.160
uh,
two breeds.
No,
he's done.
Yeah.

1270
01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:20.903
<v 5>Hey Jean,
how,
until you do,</v>

1271
01:27:20.930 --> 01:27:25.930
can I get a grilled steak stuffed taco supreme stadio hold a stake case.

1272
01:27:27.271 --> 01:27:30.700
Surrito
and,
Hey,

1273
01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:34.500
what did you want to draw up?
Yeah,

1274
01:27:34.510 --> 01:27:39.310
can I get in for cheese?
Rollups
and that'll do it.

1275
01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:44.150
Yup.
All right.
Thanks Mommy.

1276
01:27:47.330 --> 01:27:51.020
<v 0>That's Dave.
That's really good.
I like the,
Hey Hitler.
He threw it on there.</v>

1277
01:27:51.150 --> 01:27:54.750
It was really unexpected.
Hey Hitler,
what?
What'd you want?
Good work.
Very,

1278
01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:59.190
very unexpected.
Thank you.
Hey Jean.
Still your money.
The money.
It's me.

1279
01:27:59.191 --> 01:28:03.210
Jeans.
Uh Hey James.
Hi Mommy.

1280
01:28:03.930 --> 01:28:08.460
It's your genes.
Hey Mommy.
It's your genes.
Yeah,
I know you're the water champ.

1281
01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:12.150
Thank you for the water for as long as I've known you.
Thank you.
Infuriating.

1282
01:28:12.151 --> 01:28:16.440
Yeah.
Actually you have to admit something though.
No,
this past week.
No,

1283
01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:21.810
dude,
you've seen me taking that big plastic one up.
What are you taught?

1284
01:28:21.811 --> 01:28:26.010
Workouts?
What are you talking about?
You're blatantly lying.
What plastic ones?

1285
01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:31.530
The big water tumbler.
I've been,
I've been drinking that.
Oh,
you know what?

1286
01:28:31.531 --> 01:28:34.500
I saw the water tumbler cause I saw that it was upstairs in the bedroom and it

1287
01:28:34.501 --> 01:28:39.360
was full.
And then I saw it fall and then I brought it down because it was full.

1288
01:28:39.390 --> 01:28:44.070
I probably had five gallons of water.
Oh my God.
You lie.
No,
I don't.

1289
01:28:44.071 --> 01:28:48.630
So my drinking,
I don't want to hear it.
I don't want water.
Oh my fucking God.

1290
01:28:48.631 --> 01:28:52.620
That's true.
I was actually stopped and I was like,
man,

1291
01:28:53.130 --> 01:28:55.500
I was just impressed with myself.
I had to stop and go like,

1292
01:28:55.501 --> 01:28:58.500
you're the fucking and enough,
I don't want to hear you.
That's true.

1293
01:28:58.501 --> 01:29:03.480
Your lies true.
Very.
I haven't really want Korean food.
I am dying.

1294
01:29:03.530 --> 01:29:07.350
Um,
well it's not going to happen.
So it's going to happen.
I'm going to go alone.

1295
01:29:07.610 --> 01:29:11.880
Yeah.
After patrion.
Yes.
Put that shit down.
Yes.

1296
01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:16.440
Patrion put it shut down after we're doing.
Um,
oh cool.

1297
01:29:16.650 --> 01:29:19.480
Somebody sent you a glass and glass.

1298
01:29:21.890 --> 01:29:23.790
Somebody said,
let's see.
Burdis fat.
Hey,

1299
01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:27.150
mommy's just wanting to submit some more proof of who the number one water

1300
01:29:27.151 --> 01:29:29.790
champion is as if we need more proof.

1301
01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.190
Tuesday showed the ice house was great.

1302
01:29:32.610 --> 01:29:36.990
Obviously a result of superior hydration.
Keep up the good work.

1303
01:29:37.230 --> 01:29:42.060
Thanks genes.
This email came in and look what they circled.

1304
01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:45.030
One photo shopped after the show.

1305
01:29:45.031 --> 01:29:49.230
Photo shopped somebody of the show.
It's daylight out.

1306
01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:54.280
How's that after?
Because they have lights on outside.
How's are really good?
Yeah.

1307
01:29:54.330 --> 01:29:57.800
That's not so anyways,
so first of all,
jobs all,

1308
01:29:58.950 --> 01:30:03.210
thank you for submitting your art.
Yeah.
Thank you very much.

1309
01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:07.840
Like how thin your beard was.
Did you have an email you wanted to read now?

1310
01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:12.660
A new fart.
Smell him.
Mommy's I moved in with my fiance over little year ago,

1311
01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:15.750
little over a year ago.
And now my farts and brown smell like his,

1312
01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:20.430
we are currently working opposite shifts and aren't even eating the same foods.

1313
01:30:20.430 --> 01:30:24.600
I'm very scared that I have lost my fart and Brown identity.
What do I do?

1314
01:30:24.601 --> 01:30:27.630
Lots of love,
Hannah.
I think you should take that one.
Jeans,

1315
01:30:28.890 --> 01:30:33.720
first of all.
Um,
really interesting problem.
Yeah,
real issue.

1316
01:30:33.721 --> 01:30:38.390
They're life changing issue.
I mean,
look,
on occasion I've,

1317
01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:40.950
my farts have smelled like toms,

1318
01:30:40.951 --> 01:30:43.830
but that's because we've eaten similarly.

1319
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:48.510
Now here's the real question.
Do Your Brown smell alike?

1320
01:30:48.990 --> 01:30:53.290
And I doubt that mountain men's Brown tends to smell more pungent than women's

1321
01:30:53.310 --> 01:30:58.050
Brown.
So I wouldn't stress too much about you so far.
And Brown and Brown.

1322
01:30:58.110 --> 01:31:00.840
Oh Wow.
And you're not eating the same thing.

1323
01:31:00.841 --> 01:31:04.440
I find that hard to believe you're sharing a home.
Uh,

1324
01:31:04.441 --> 01:31:08.140
it could be bacteria in the house that you guys are sharing.
Yeah,

1325
01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:12.330
it could be a beverage.
Are you guys sharing the same coffee?

1326
01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:14.130
Because coffee makes you brown and fired.

1327
01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:17.310
The main thing I would just emphasize is that this is a breaking point in the

1328
01:31:17.311 --> 01:31:22.290
relationship.
I mean,
you need to solve this problem.
Um,

1329
01:31:22.650 --> 01:31:23.940
maybe take a trip,

1330
01:31:24.450 --> 01:31:29.450
I would say into the wilderness together and pitch a tent face to face.

1331
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:34.030
Don't even bring fire with,
see if you can make it and,

1332
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:36.990
and see what happens to your browns when you're out there.

1333
01:31:37.530 --> 01:31:42.530
When you're away from your house is what you're saying is on the line to see how

1334
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:48.240
the stress is affecting my digestive system.
It's a really interesting point.

1335
01:31:48.690 --> 01:31:52.590
That's what I would do.
Okay.
Um Hm.

1336
01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:56.040
It is upsetting for her though.
It did not have your own brown identity.

1337
01:31:56.041 --> 01:31:59.200
I don't think that that's fair.
It's really interesting.
True water champ.

1338
01:31:59.201 --> 01:32:00.220
Mind Games,
someone

1339
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:01.053
<v 4>writes,</v>

1340
01:32:01.150 --> 01:32:04.300
they said I had a breakthrough on the identity of true water champion when I

1341
01:32:04.301 --> 01:32:07.090
started engaging my own water competition with my girlfriend.

1342
01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:12.460
My girlfriend was formerly very adverse to drinking water instead of nagging her

1343
01:32:12.461 --> 01:32:13.930
and trying to bull here into drinking it.

1344
01:32:14.230 --> 01:32:18.970
I drew inspiration from your mom's house and simply stated that I was the water

1345
01:32:18.971 --> 01:32:23.200
champion and I pointed to her full glass of water as evidence of this human

1346
01:32:23.201 --> 01:32:26.440
beings being prideful creatures.
She immediately disagreed,

1347
01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:29.980
pounded the water to her face and has since started drinking way more water to

1348
01:32:29.981 --> 01:32:32.650
prove that she is the real water champion.

1349
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:36.460
She doesn't realize this was my main plan all along and no matter how much water

1350
01:32:36.461 --> 01:32:40.690
she drinks,
I will always and forever be the water champ regionally of course,

1351
01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:45.070
because it was I who put us both back on the path to hydration health.

1352
01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:49.150
A Win for her is it went for me as long as she drinks or water.

1353
01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:50.980
If you listen in earlier episodes,
Mommy,

1354
01:32:50.981 --> 01:32:55.981
Tina actually pulled this exact maneuver on Tommy when she was worried about the

1355
01:32:56.081 --> 01:32:58.240
color of his urine.
So even though Tommy Buns,

1356
01:32:58.270 --> 01:33:01.960
giant bear that he is drinks more water by volume,
not true.

1357
01:33:02.010 --> 01:33:04.060
Now that the country has been true,

1358
01:33:04.420 --> 01:33:07.930
all of his water gains are points scored for Tina because she essentially

1359
01:33:07.931 --> 01:33:10.120
tricked him.
Yeah,
thank you.
Drinking more water.

1360
01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:14.110
If you think if you go back and listen to the origin or the water championship,

1361
01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:19.440
there really is no doubt that Mommy Tina is playing head games with Tommy.

1362
01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:22.480
Absolutely right.
Thank you for your observation.
Well,

1363
01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:27.930
I guess we picked up another retarded listener,
so there's all,

1364
01:33:28.150 --> 01:33:32.440
there's that stupid.
Um,
uh Oh this one says I'll keep it.

1365
01:33:33.010 --> 01:33:35.110
I'll keep it short because you've got to read the other emails,

1366
01:33:35.111 --> 01:33:39.910
but that hairstyle is called the skull.
It the one that I want Tina to have.

1367
01:33:41.050 --> 01:33:42.190
Yeah,
let's try,
let's see.

1368
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:47.340
<v 0>I don't like this hairstyle.
This,
this is what I do.
Why?</v>

1369
01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:52.070
This is what I want you to have though.
Why do you insist on this?
No,

1370
01:33:52.071 --> 01:33:53.510
I don't like that at all.

1371
01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:57.330
<v 4>That is it.
That's it.
She's right.
He's right.</v>

1372
01:33:57.870 --> 01:34:02.700
I would say this one is the best,
most like it.
So we just,

1373
01:34:03.150 --> 01:34:04.170
we cut the top off.

1374
01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:09.200
You tell me that you have a special coming out and the promo is you with no hair

1375
01:34:10.831 --> 01:34:15.570
on top but long hair on the sides and that that's not going to draw attention to

1376
01:34:15.571 --> 01:34:18.060
them listening.
You have to think in terms of,

1377
01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:22.260
I need to drive people's interest into clicking play.
Right.

1378
01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:26.040
So wouldn't that help do it?
Oh,
a woman with his haircut?

1379
01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:30.990
<v 0>Yes.
And can you click on the third from the right there?
Yeah,
I know this guy.</v>

1380
01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:34.230
Yeah,
he's fine.
Um,
yes.

1381
01:34:34.231 --> 01:34:38.190
But only when you start to make your retarded comedy albums.

1382
01:34:38.250 --> 01:34:40.410
Why are you making it?
We're talking about you.

1383
01:34:40.411 --> 01:34:43.700
You do the world's only retarded comedian and I,

1384
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:45.560
<v 4>I'll do the skull it.
Oh,</v>

1385
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:50.630
Phil Spector's gotta go one bell.
That was weird.
I mean,

1386
01:34:50.631 --> 01:34:55.040
that's a weird Gallagher Gallagher.
Yeah.

1387
01:34:56.210 --> 01:34:58.000
Hogan.
Hannah had that going

1388
01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:00.110
<v 9>for a while.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Anyways,</v>

1389
01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:04.370
I still think it's a really good idea that I had for you.
Thank you.
Here you go.

1390
01:35:04.730 --> 01:35:08.540
This is you right here.
He's got the blonde hair.

1391
01:35:09.730 --> 01:35:14.680
See,
it's not gonna.
It's not a successful look.
Well,

1392
01:35:15.870 --> 01:35:18.230
I have to respectfully disagree.

1393
01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:23.030
Let me see if there's any topics we're forgetting.
Okay.
I'm about to

1394
01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:26.000
play the closing song

1395
01:35:28.770 --> 01:35:32.600
and then we got it.
We got it.
We're going to get some food.

1396
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:34.360
We're going to go pantry on.

1397
01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:39.580
Put the picture on patrion.com/mom that's where we do the page on episode.

1398
01:35:39.710 --> 01:35:44.320
Yeah,
we got some packages to open,
blah,

1399
01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:49.850
blah,
blah,
blah.
You guys got to take it off.
If it,

1400
01:35:49.851 --> 01:35:51.950
I'll have it and it's on the,

1401
01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:55.780
you said take it out of the fucking menu is yet says you have it on the

1402
01:35:55.810 --> 01:35:56.643
<v 3>menu.</v>

1403
01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:01.870
You imagined that anytime a restaurant ran out of anything,
they go,

1404
01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:04.890
we have to remove it from the menu.
Now it's not.

1405
01:36:05.010 --> 01:36:09.880
And then we'll reprint these tomorrow.
She has is that it's a chain restaurant.

1406
01:36:09.881 --> 01:36:14.140
Yeah,
and it's a corporate thing.
Like if you're going to in regular restaurant,

1407
01:36:14.141 --> 01:36:18.150
they run out of something and in order enough,
whatever.
It's Saturday night.

1408
01:36:18.151 --> 01:36:19.390
But dude,
snow

1409

Bro.
