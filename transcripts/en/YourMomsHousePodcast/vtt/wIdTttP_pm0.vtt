1
00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.290
Well.
Well,

2
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.393

3
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.500
<v 0>first.
We're not
to finger spell it.</v>

4
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.000
Yay.
Aye.

5
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.933
Nay

6
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.993
Nay.

7
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.680
Jina nope.

8
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.183
Nope.

9
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.160
You're going to sign the to live long and prosper,
uh,

10
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.860
facing forward you a couple of times.
So again,

11
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.813
Ay

12
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.693
Ay

13
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.080
ay
Ay.

14
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.430
Okay.
That was Ramsey.
It's really good work.

15
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.540
Totally amaze.
Really special.
The tank,

16
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.800
t I n t

17
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.320
s t a.
And T.

18
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.190
I really like her.

19
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.350
<v 3>All right.
Um,
you ready to open the show?</v>

20
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.980
What the clip that you wanted or do you want a different one?
Um,

21
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.340
<v 0>you surprise me.
I don't know.</v>

22
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.780
<v 2>Okay,
here we go.
Let's open the show</v>

23
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.070
<v 3>with me.
Here is air for Fineman.</v>

24
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.820
Who is honestly the world's first student body president who identifies as

25
00:02:48.821 --> 00:02:50.290
gender non binary.

26
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.460
<v 1>Don't bring in one loving to this.</v>

27
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.360
Well go to your mom's house,

28
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.383
Christina.

29
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.850
<v 4>Uh,
yeah man.</v>

30
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.640
So this was on fusion fusion TV and um,

31
00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.380
this is fantastic.
Yeah.

32
00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.070
This a first student body president and it's non binary.

33
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.000
I was hoping the president would come out as nonbinary.

34
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.620
What one of my favorite parts about this nonbinary um,

35
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.070
you know,
yeah.

36
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.490
Is when you get to see people talk about it in interviews.
Yeah.

37
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.050
And really when you,
you can really start to appreciate the nonsense it is.
Um,

38
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.860
because this person essentially just as like,
oh,

39
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.160
it's just feelings that day.
Yeah.
I like to see what the argument is.

40
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.330
She looks like a her and I don't want to presume,
well,
you know what,

41
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.130
you should make presumptions,

42
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.280
<v 0>which is a mouthful.
And maybe some people don't know what that is exactly,</v>

43
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:41.980
but luckily we didn't have you to explain it.
So Erica,

44
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:44.770
tell me a little bit about yourself.
What does it mean to be gender nonbinary?

45
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.163
<v 4>MMM.</v>

46
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.110
<v 0>Means that I don't really identify as a man or a woman.</v>

47
00:04:49.111 --> 00:04:52.680
It's somewhere in the middle,
but where in the middle of the fence on the day.

48
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.750
<v 4>Yeah.
Wait a minute.
I understand.</v>

49
00:04:56.751 --> 00:05:00.770
Identifying somewhere in the middle.
Okay.
I've heard of people,

50
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.540
you know,
I go,
okay,
but then what?
How does it change?
Oh,
you're here.
Find out.

51
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.580
That's the part.
I don't get it.

52
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.060
<v 0>His eye,
you know,</v>

53
00:05:08.061 --> 00:05:11.210
err more towards a feminine side or I like to present more femininely,

54
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.180
but there are other days where I fall more in the middle and then a little more

55
00:05:14.181 --> 00:05:18.140
on the [inaudible] side.
Like for example,
today I have men's pants on,

56
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.250
but I also have my hair and makeup.

57
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.490
<v 4>You mean like everybody?
Everybody in the world that,</v>

58
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.830
what do you mean?
Everybody in the world?
People,

59
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.870
men and women err towards one side or or another from a data.
Oh,

60
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:34.630
I see what you're saying.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I mean,
yeah,

61
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:39.631
you might put more makeup on and address one day and you might feel especially

62
00:05:41.111 --> 00:05:45.490
feminine and the next day you might wear a tee shirt and jeans and then,

63
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.940
but does that mean that I'm identifying more mass male,

64
00:05:48.941 --> 00:05:51.880
masculine on a certain level you are or aren't?
I am.
Yeah.
That means,

65
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.220
wait a minute,
we've just discovered that I'm not,
oh my God,
I'm non binary.

66
00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.250
Binary.

67
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.730
<v 3>Oh my God.
This whole time I've been so confused.
I think,
by the way,</v>

68
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:04.100
I know there's some people listening that are shaking their head.

69
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.370
I think you deserve the full mockery of what you're going to get because this is

70
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.200
utter and complete nonsense.
Yeah.
I,
you know,

71
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.140
are not different.

72
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.640
Everybody from day to day can feel more feminine or mastering.

73
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.060
I agree.
If I feel as though throughout my day I switch and,

74
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.930
but then I don't demand that other people address me by my proper pronouns.

75
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.400
Not An asshole.
That's what,

76
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.780
that's the problem is that the demand that the external world match the internal

77
00:06:35.781 --> 00:06:39.920
world that you refer to me as my chosen pronouns.
Yeah.

78
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.310
Hold on.
I'm a zero now.
Yeah.

79
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.370
So does she go full heat?
Who it that they,

80
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.750
they,
I dunno.
Zim Will,
let's zero it up a second.

81
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.130
It's kind of finding a way to exist outside the binary and really have fun with

82
00:06:58.131 --> 00:07:02.330
the performative aspects of gender,
the word,
you know what all that is.

83
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.460
I learned that as an Undergrad in philosophy,

84
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:09.580
the performative aspects that these are all fancy words for like what it looks

85
00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:13.810
like is what she's saying.
Performative aspects of the

86
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.790
academic talk.
I'm going to start saying that in interviews.
Yes.

87
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:24.791
Whenever I say that I'm really into the perfect performative aspect of gender.

88
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.760
Oh,
gender expression.
You have to use that phrase

89
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.900
formative,
but the performative aspects of gender

90
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:42.590
that is 100% academic nonsense that nobody in the real world understands

91
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.840
performative aspects of gender.
Yep.
Right lady.

92
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:56.450
I remember in philosophy they would say like the discursive reasoning and you're

93
00:07:56.451 --> 00:07:58.520
like,
well,
there's no,
what does that mean?

94
00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:03.140
There's no track that gets more bullshit language and philosophy.

95
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:06.290
Well,
yeah,
we're pretty good at it.
Yeah,
I definitely,

96
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.350
I remember I read a book once on ocular centrism,

97
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.850
which meant that because we all see the world through our eyes,

98
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.260
that there's a bias towards the eye.
For instance,
you would say,
ah,

99
00:08:18.261 --> 00:08:21.350
I see what you're saying,
or do you see what I mean?

100
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.540
Ocular centrism and that's somehow a bias that we need to overcome.

101
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:31.640
Why do we need these less class that I tried to read your friend who was an

102
00:08:31.641 --> 00:08:36.020
author and a philosophy teacher,
like a page of his book,

103
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.390
but I realized that it's because I don't have the brain,
the capacity.

104
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.000
I did not know what the fuck he was talking about.

105
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.010
I don't think it's your brain that's deficient

106
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.330
in the bubble of academia long enough.
Yeah,
that's true.

107
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.330
They all speak the same bullshit language.
And that's what,

108
00:08:53.331 --> 00:08:57.600
this is an unfortunate,
uh,
product of the academic,

109
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:01.110
the ivory tower,
the system that tells you everything is validated,

110
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:04.320
everything is merited and warranted.
And I think this is dog.

111
00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:07.250
She was a bit of attention to,

112
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:12.260
this is how you're different.
They're like forced to version of the,

113
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.360
of you being different.
Can I tell people are like,
I'm from Taiwan.

114
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:19.140
That's interesting.
And then she walks in and goes,
I'm kinda nine binaries.
Yeah.

115
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:23.200
It's an identity.
What?
Well,
you're from Taiwan.
You thought that was cool,
right?

116
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:28.080
I'm nonbinary.
Or it's like,
Hey,
I'm,
I'm golf or I'm Greg.
Or it's like what?

117
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.320
What music used to be the,
can I tell you why?

118
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:33.630
I think it's kind of bullshit cause on that's deep bro.

119
00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:35.250
I put a put a very sincere,

120
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:40.050
sincere call out there asking for a nonbinary person to come forward and talk

121
00:09:40.051 --> 00:09:43.980
about it on that team.
I'm really curious,
like enlighten me if I'm wrong,

122
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:45.120
if we're off base here,

123
00:09:45.121 --> 00:09:49.230
if I'm behind history and not one person has written to me,

124
00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:52.470
has thousands of people and a lot of people listen to that show and every time I

125
00:09:52.471 --> 00:09:53.281
put a call out,
hey,

126
00:09:53.281 --> 00:09:57.300
do you live off the grid and I'll get like 10 off the gridders or is your,

127
00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.830
were you in a cult?
I got,
you know,
eight people who were in cults.

128
00:10:00.831 --> 00:10:05.820
So it's like this,
this thing is a little not true,
you know,

129
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.260
and it's not ringing true.

130
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.520
The way that you identify goes way beyond what you were taught to me a little

131
00:10:11.521 --> 00:10:16.110
bit about how you feel in your own skin.
I don't think she knows how she feels.

132
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.250
I'm sorry,
day.
Quite a bit of depression.

133
00:10:20.251 --> 00:10:22.080
When I was trying to figure out who I was.

134
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.430
That was something I was really hard to experience of gender dysphoria,

135
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:31.020
gender dysphoria,
such low self confidence.
Wait a minute.

136
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:34.260
Gender Dysphoria,
is that what I'm going through?

137
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.990
You might be going through it right now.
Oh No.

138
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.630
I am identifying as female,

139
00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:43.010
but I have a dysphoria about this.

140
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:47.250
W and I met people,
they,
them pronouns.
Something clicked and I was like wait,

141
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:53.680
really was so legitimizing and natal legitimizing legitimate.

142
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.880
That's another academic word.
Write that one down.
Legitimizing.

143
00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:00.540
They love to use that in academia is the thing that

144
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.120
I heard they them pronouns.

145
00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.900
I got to get on board.
That's what they said.

146
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.620
You and I met people who use they them pronouns.

147
00:11:13.621 --> 00:11:18.120
Something clicked and I was like,
wait,
but don't you think?

148
00:11:18.121 --> 00:11:22.540
And this is going to sound really stupid and I admit it's just cause I don't,

149
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.220
I'm ignorant.
Yes.
So save the angry emails but isn't,
it isn't.

150
00:11:27.221 --> 00:11:29.940
She's kind of confused about her sexuality.

151
00:11:29.941 --> 00:11:32.550
Even though sexuality and gender are two different things.
I understand.

152
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:34.680
Isn't she really just a lesbian?

153
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:39.390
The gender and sexuality are two different things.

154
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.250
Just the pants and then sometimes I'll tell you why.

155
00:11:47.251 --> 00:11:50.820
Cause most lesbians I knew in college kind of look like her,

156
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.880
you know what I'm saying is maybe,

157
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.650
maybe the marine be their real identity crisis is like,

158
00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:02.020
do I want to go between the,
between the,
yeah,
the vagina.

159
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:06.970
The butthole.
Cut It in half.
I mean it could be,
right.

160
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.750
Maybe she needs to lick a few Virgenes and then she'll figure out her agenda.

161
00:12:10.751 --> 00:12:15.310
I did.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I mean,
how are the two not,

162
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:16.960
I don't know.
There's to be a,

163
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:20.080
there should be a lot more snickering amongst her peers and they're all

164
00:12:20.081 --> 00:12:24.790
passively accepting what is fucking total horseshit and incense and staring

165
00:12:24.791 --> 00:12:29.260
down.
You could tell them to no,
this is great.
They're like,
I have to accept this.

166
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.050
That's because if you don't,
and the academic world,

167
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:36.580
you're considered a totally irrational.
I know you're a fucking neanderthal.
Yeah.

168
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:41.470
Dummy redneck.
I,
I tell you,
there's not been a lot of push back on us for,

169
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.110
well,
I'll tell you Jean,
I went to pro.

170
00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.230
No one's pushed back on me making fun of it.

171
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.990
<v 4>Oh,
it's so dumb.
I went to uh,
a Yukon,</v>

172
00:12:50.991 --> 00:12:52.100
so I was in academia.

173
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.681
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

174
00:12:52.681 --> 00:12:57.060
And did they ask you what your Pronoun was before you took the stage or asking?

175
00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:58.920
Very disappointed.
I had a great time there.

176
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.020
And you said so you were very pleased.

177
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:03.750
<v 4>I was.
See the thing is people don't realize they,</v>

178
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:09.280
when you do colleges and it's students only,
it is a bit of a,

179
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.130
you're stepping into the unknown.
Yeah.

180
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:14.800
Because academia is this like imagine doing stand up to that crowd I just showed

181
00:13:14.801 --> 00:13:19.210
you.
They're very repressed.
Yes.
And it's very oppressive.
Very offended.

182
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:23.350
Usually by a lot.
Yeah.
So and like I'm not,
yeah,
the Cray,

183
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:28.360
you know the most offensive dude.
But you know,
I'm a,
I'm a club comic.
Aye.

184
00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.060
Aye.
Aye.
Tour.
I performed for adults.

185
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:35.230
So you always have that moment right before you hit a college stage where you're

186
00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:37.330
like,
is this going to go downhill?

187
00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.910
<v 3>Well,
and,
and I've had situations where they told me beforehand,</v>

188
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:44.570
you can't talk about sex.
You can't talk about religion,
can't talk about drug.

189
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:48.830
You can't do alcohol and nothing.
So w what we talk about baking cookies,

190
00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:54.140
<v 4>recipes.
Yeah.
I know you.
And it can all be taken the wrong way.</v>

191
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:57.230
Everything can be anything.
Anything.

192
00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.740
You pick your poke fun at this and it could be like boo.
Yeah.

193
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.940
If you get that whole crowd that's super,
super nonbinary.
Yeah.

194
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:08.150
So anyways,
that was really,
really happy that it was.

195
00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:09.170
<v 3>It was,
did,
it was fun.</v>

196
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.870
And were you able to do your normal set or did you cater it?

197
00:14:11.871 --> 00:14:16.190
I did the set that I'm touring with right now and,
oh,
that's fantastic.
Yeah.

198
00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.100
Well that's very good news than you'll be had in college.
Even

199
00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.070
<v 4>for a second before college.
You go like,
oh,
that's an old,
uh,
you know,</v>

200
00:14:22.071 --> 00:14:23.540
you pull them in your brain and you go,

201
00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:28.160
I'll have that on deck if I need to do something to get out of this.
Yeah.

202
00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.040
I didn't have to do any of it.
That's a wonderful thing.
Yeah.

203
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.200
And I did Fsu the week before,
which was fun,

204
00:14:33.201 --> 00:14:36.260
but they did the most preferable way to do colleges,

205
00:14:36.261 --> 00:14:39.200
which is half students and then open to the public.

206
00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.540
So you have an ideal crowd.

207
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.330
You had this perfect kids and then adults and they can,

208
00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:48.160
they have permission to laugh when the adults laugh.
Exactly.
Inappropriate.
Yeah.

209
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:52.790
Quote inappropriate.
Exactly.
So that,
that was a,
that really fun.
Um,

210
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.120
do you know what happened?
And I didn't tell you this in art,

211
00:14:56.121 --> 00:15:00.590
maybe I did tell you this in Minneapolis and where mommy apple tits.
Yeah,

212
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.450
I'm in Minneapolis.
It's,

213
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.840
so I'm on the tour right now and there are regular seats and premium seats in

214
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.900
premium seats come with a meet and greet.
And for those wondering,

215
00:15:11.901 --> 00:15:15.290
why wouldn't you just meet everybody after the show?

216
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:19.220
It's really just because of how much time it would take.
So they,
you know,

217
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.390
do a select number of seats and they go,
these people can do a meet and greet.

218
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.770
So I've had that in every city.
Um,

219
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:31.130
almost nobody used their meet and greets in Minneapolis.
Yeah,

220
00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.930
I dunno.
I think from what I heard or from what I saw,
like people tweeting at me,

221
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.040
they didn't know that it wasn't that,

222
00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.370
that they just didn't know they were entitled to.

223
00:15:40.371 --> 00:15:42.380
We had a lot of laughs about it and then everyone was like,

224
00:15:42.381 --> 00:15:45.680
nobody wants to meet you.
Um,
so what happened was,

225
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:50.510
and also they accidentally oversold them.
So second show,

226
00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:55.130
Saturday they go,
you have 87 meet and greet.
So I was like,
whoa.

227
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.970
Because normally they try to keep it to 50.
I met six people after that shit.

228
00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:05.600
I go,
okay.
So Minneapolis,
it's just,
no,
uh,
I,

229
00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:06.800
I don't know what the,

230
00:16:06.801 --> 00:16:09.890
obviously with the confusion was there because in every other city it's been

231
00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.490
completely fine and normal and New Orleans,

232
00:16:13.491 --> 00:16:18.400
Atlanta or Clearwater Tampon,
Milwaukee Ma,

233
00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.640
it worked normal in every city except for Minneapolis.
That's weird.
Yeah.

234
00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:24.490
They weren't informed.
Yeah.

235
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:29.060
But the shows were really fun and the whole weekend was really fun.

236
00:16:29.061 --> 00:16:30.710
I had a lot of people asking me,

237
00:16:30.711 --> 00:16:35.711
Mike Cronin is bone snake three on Twitter and he killed it and the first

238
00:16:36.501 --> 00:16:39.560
weekend was Carlos Valencia and he fucking killed it.

239
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:44.060
So really good time.
Really enjoyed,
uh,

240
00:16:44.061 --> 00:16:48.460
those both legs of the tour and uh,
yeah,

241
00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:54.170
I know there's some,
and it's like a new city every day.
So crazy.
Yeah,

242
00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.480
it's very tiring.
It's exhausting.
Yeah.

243
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:03.440
What city did you,
what'd you like the best?
What did I like the best?

244
00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.740
I was too hard to say.
It's too hard to say.
I mean

245
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:12.560
all the shows have been fun really.
There,
there hasn't been like a bummer show.

246
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.940
Thank God I haven't been to the southwest yet.
Have you for the decor?

247
00:17:16.941 --> 00:17:18.940
I go but I haven't been for a show yet.
No.

248
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.700
What are you going to do when you have to go to southwest?
Will that,

249
00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.700
will that make you not like it?
I don't know.

250
00:17:25.701 --> 00:17:30.310
I'm thinking of getting a Bolo Tie and uh,
you know,
getting the,

251
00:17:30.311 --> 00:17:34.270
the denim buttoned down with a Bolo and that's not a bad,
the dentist,

252
00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.840
not the bad part horse.
Um,
I dunno.
Maybe I,

253
00:17:38.841 --> 00:17:43.490
should I rock that from my Albuquerque if I do Albuquerque?
Of course.
Yeah.
Yeah,

254
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.620
that'd be fun.
Yeah.
That's neat.

255
00:17:45.621 --> 00:17:50.280
Your dad called the other day and he was taking a shit as

256
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:53.280
<v 3>we were facetiming him.
Yeah.
He didn't hang up.</v>

257
00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:57.480
Did he know without shelter,
by the way?
Taking a public shit?

258
00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:01.320
Yeah.
That wasn't at home.
I didn't know that.
He was like,

259
00:18:01.321 --> 00:18:02.520
I think shifts here all the time.

260
00:18:02.521 --> 00:18:07.360
And he just kept talking and know and I'm like,
do you want to hit?

261
00:18:07.361 --> 00:18:11.220
And he was like,
oh,
check it out.
And he was like leaning and wiping.
Yeah.

262
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:14.220
Oh my God.
Yeah.
Cause we were,
we were on the way to the mall,

263
00:18:14.221 --> 00:18:16.680
which has become our favorite new thing to do.

264
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:22.250
And you were talking about how your dad is so good at being married that he's a

265
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.680
personality type,
that it's a really good fit for him.

266
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:28.730
<v 4>He loves marriage.</v>

267
00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:34.060
We were talking about like what would happen if one of my parents died first and

268
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:38.570
I think,
uh,
I think my dad might talk more of a game of like,

269
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:42.860
you know,
Oh I would meet people and date and stuff,
but no,

270
00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.270
also,
Yo,

271
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:48.320
we pointed out that much like you remind me there's no woman that could tolerate

272
00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.470
<v 3>no,
you're disgusting at this point.
Now Your Dad,</v>

273
00:18:50.471 --> 00:18:55.471
because your dad probably would date a few people just to break that in prose

274
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:58.990
post-marriage nut off,
you know?
Huh.

275
00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:01.450
It's been 40 years with the same woman or whatever.
Sure.

276
00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:05.620
So he'll probably do that.
But I just see him as a creature of habit.
Yeah.

277
00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:10.980
Like he wants to have the everyday comfort that marriages like a warm meal,

278
00:19:11.181 --> 00:19:12.130
a clean bed.

279
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:14.620
<v 4>It's so weird.
I can't,</v>

280
00:19:14.621 --> 00:19:17.440
it's funny when when you talk to people whose parents been together this long,

281
00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:20.560
you came and picture anything.
Like I would have tried to picture it.

282
00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:22.360
I can't even wrap my head around it.

283
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.250
<v 3>And being a dating or just being alone,
just</v>

284
00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:30.060
<v 4>no date.
Like how he would function with another person,
you know,
is also it.</v>

285
00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:35.130
You get to this these later ages in life,
you go,
uh,

286
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.510
just everyone's so particular and they have their,

287
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:41.120
<v 3>are there routines that I just,
I don't know how,
yeah,</v>

288
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:44.090
he might try to recreate what he had with your mom.

289
00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.710
I think that's what everybody would do.
Yeah.
You know,
and he'd be like,

290
00:19:46.711 --> 00:19:47.890
just make my coffee baby.

291
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:55.610
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cause they have their little rituals.
Routines that,
yeah.

292
00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.870
The other good night stuff.
I know.
Oh yeah.

293
00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.610
She rubs his back or something at night with the,

294
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:06.070
with the [inaudible] this is a thing.
Yeah.
And,

295
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:10.610
and that's what they do is like kits,
the lights at like nine.
And she was like,

296
00:20:10.611 --> 00:20:14.720
can I read my iPad?
And he's like,
ah,
I kind of bothering me from that too.

297
00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.750
She's like,
I have to sit in the dark.
Yeah.

298
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.150
That's why I love,
that's how you and I are though.
Cause I,

299
00:20:23.151 --> 00:20:27.710
it's lights out for me at nine 30 and then you're watching the movie full
volume.

300
00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:32.630
Oh my God.
You guys turn it down years.
You're like lab,

301
00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.510
you always have,
it goes down,
down,
down.

302
00:20:35.511 --> 00:20:38.720
I had it on volume the other night and you go cute tearing the analog.

303
00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.030
Well cause you're watching violent stuff.

304
00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:46.031
It's always explosions and guns and me please.

305
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.070
So we go to,

306
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.900
<v 4>uh,
we have our routine now.</v>

307
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:55.030
We've joined this new country club called the mall and we go all the time,

308
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.510
all the time.
Now before we had a kid,

309
00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:02.170
you and I would do the crate and barrel weekend trip and that was a big part of

310
00:21:02.171 --> 00:21:06.940
our day.
That was real exciting.
But it was always just like a window shopping.

311
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:10.360
And mostly I would be,
oh well yeah,
that,
oh,
that would be cool.

312
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:14.180
The strawberry Huller and aren't those glasses nice.
Yeah.

313
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.530
And we would just kind of dream about owning all of the stuff at Creighton and

314
00:21:17.531 --> 00:21:19.930
we still don't have it.
No.
And then,
uh,

315
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.820
we had a kid and now when you have a toddler,

316
00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:24.820
you got to take that kid out every day.
Yeah.
So it can't stay home.

317
00:21:24.821 --> 00:21:25.481
Those of you that don't know,

318
00:21:25.481 --> 00:21:28.530
it's been raining in Los Angeles for like six weeks.
Right.

319
00:21:28.531 --> 00:21:32.680
And also so we used to do,
I mean we still get to hear them all crying.

320
00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:35.590
Everybody's crying.
Who's covered in snow,
right?
No,

321
00:21:35.591 --> 00:21:40.591
but I mean it's not at all normal raining,

322
00:21:41.471 --> 00:21:45.520
raining,
raining nonstop.
It's like the northwest.
So,
you know,

323
00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:47.530
sometimes we go to the park,
but anyways,

324
00:21:47.531 --> 00:21:50.590
with this weather we started going to the mall.

325
00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:54.790
We do feel like we joined the mall going in the club.

326
00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:56.560
Well now cause we park,

327
00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.920
we used to park in front of Nordstrom and that was our jam.

328
00:21:59.921 --> 00:22:02.110
We have that entrance.
We know where to go.

329
00:22:02.111 --> 00:22:06.220
Midwest mom now is our jam.
You know,

330
00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:08.920
I really enjoy it.
It's my jam.

331
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:13.140
Even saying that to you lately that I became a Midwestern mom.
You're,

332
00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:18.070
you have like such a mom when
I'm way cool.

333
00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:23.350
I'm the coolest mom there is.
She's,
I'm a cool mom.
Well,
I noticed that.

334
00:22:23.351 --> 00:22:24.460
I've been saying,

335
00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:29.850
I say awesome and I give a thumbs up to staff religious thought by super lame

336
00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:34.120
from my God.
But if I say awesome sauce,
I know that's the death of me.

337
00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.760
You've said that's my jam.
A lot of that is my jam,

338
00:22:36.761 --> 00:22:40.830
but I've been saying that since the nineties I feel like that is my jam.
Okay.

339
00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:45.130
Anyways,
anyways,
here's the thing about having them all membership.

340
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.810
You do kind of feel like you joined a club because here's why would somebody,

341
00:22:49.811 --> 00:22:54.550
okay,
you join a club for a few reasons.

342
00:22:54.551 --> 00:22:57.960
If you were to join a country club,
right?
First you have somewhere to go right.

343
00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.720
Check that box every day.
It's nice.
In other words,
it's clean,

344
00:23:01.721 --> 00:23:06.460
it's clean and it's warm in there.
I used to look at,
yeah,
check that box.
Yeah,

345
00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:11.380
they have a food options.
She had a cheesecake factory.

346
00:23:11.381 --> 00:23:14.290
We started parking near the cheesecake factory.

347
00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:17.740
There's a place inside of Nordstrom that cafe.

348
00:23:17.741 --> 00:23:21.070
We like that you want to feel special,
indulgent something.

349
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:24.940
Check the inbox Mrs. Fields.
Absolutely.

350
00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:30.250
And so it becomes a routine and you go,
that's where I'm going today.

351
00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:34.960
Going to spend our hour thing is too little jeans.
He likes,

352
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.640
um,
continuous movement stroller.

353
00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:41.890
So that's the other thing is you have miles of,
of,
you know,

354
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:46.040
real estate to walk in indoor walking.
Especially when it's raining

355
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.280
<v 3>outside.
He likes that.
That'll chill him out.
Yeah,</v>

356
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:55.400
yeah,
yeah.
I mean you can't go to the park.
You got to do something with that kid.

357
00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:56.780
He can't stay indoors all day.

358
00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:00.650
Can I say in house rather than this other thing you've been doing a lot lately

359
00:24:00.651 --> 00:24:03.900
is really price checking and like,

360
00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.070
well because we've been hanging out at the mall at the time and now he started

361
00:24:07.071 --> 00:24:10.720
buying more things that you don't need.
There you go.
Well you don't need it.

362
00:24:10.721 --> 00:24:14.480
His mom,
she goes,
how much stuff do you need?
And I buy a pair of sunglasses,

363
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:18.350
<v 5>half a pair of sunglasses</v>

364
00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:22.190
<v 3>and not taught like that dog.
Like I want another pair.</v>

365
00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:28.360
Let me go.
I don't know,
$200

366
00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:30.483
<v 5>sunglasses.</v>

367
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:39.570
I went to writing and I got 12 pairs for 200

368
00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.710
you want me to show you?

369
00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:45.270
<v 3>No,
I just want to get these.</v>

370
00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:47.470
<v 5>You want to talk about it?</v>

371
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.780
He's not too much money.

372
00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.870
<v 3>Maybe that's a lot of money for sunglasses.
Are you crazy?
I'm like,</v>

373
00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.990
I sold out nine shows.
I want to get my sunglasses

374
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:03.470
<v 5>so much.</v>

375
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:10.510
<v 3>There it is.
Perfect impression of you.
It's not how I talk.</v>

376
00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:16.080
The other day you wanted to buy fancy glasses but LJ was having a meltdown and I

377
00:25:16.081 --> 00:25:20.940
said,
well we'll hold off.
Let's left.
Come back tomorrow.
That's all I'm saying.

378
00:25:20.941 --> 00:25:24.110
Yeah,
we're going to be there tomorrow.
You can pick out your shit later.
Yeah,

379
00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:34.800
it is expensive.
$200 for sunglasses.
It's ridiculous.

380
00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:39.240
Who does that?
Barely.
Barely,
barely.

381
00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:43.650
That's a lot for us.
For Plastic and that Luxotica we've seen the documentary.

382
00:25:43.651 --> 00:25:47.490
Tom,
you want to see what your code cost?
No,

383
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:48.870
no I don't.

384
00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:54.690
I know I got you a nice just because present.

385
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:58.170
I know,
but I,
what did I tell you?
Take it back.

386
00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:03.120
I get very guilty and I don't like it and I get really weird about it.
No,

387
00:26:03.121 --> 00:26:03.870
you shouldn't.

388
00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:08.730
He know that I don't accept gifts or love or kindness for easily my gut.

389
00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:13.230
That's why FIFA and I are buddies were both shelter dogs.
We're both,

390
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:17.250
we're both,
you know,
we always think that this is our last meal.

391
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.550
A Nice coat though.
Did that.
You did.
Thank you.
You love it.
I love it.

392
00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:25.440
It's beautiful.
It's a,
it's a life peace.
The life coat.
Yeah.

393
00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:29.580
Yeah.
Like I said,
he goes,
this is this,
this is one for your collection,

394
00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:34.320
this collection.
I go,
okay,
the rest is the gap.
This is my gap collection.

395
00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.320
You're funny because you definitely are like that though.
Since the,

396
00:26:37.321 --> 00:26:41.910
since we started dating,
you've been like,
uh,

397
00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:44.130
I got this TV 89,

398
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:48.330
<v 4>um,
then you should get a new one now.
It still works.</v>

399
00:26:48.331 --> 00:26:52.320
You just turn the knob and then she's got to move the ears and you can watch

400
00:26:52.321 --> 00:26:56.590
anything.
You know.
It is that communist upbringing though,
because we didn't,

401
00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:01.410
I didn't,
I wasn't raised that way.
The American way.
You just buy stuff like,
yeah,

402
00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:04.410
I just held on to shit my whole life.
No,
I know.
It's just upbringing.

403
00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.100
It's communists.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You get in the bread line.
Yeah.

404
00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.740
I hope it all works out.
Help me get a banana.
Yeah.
Maybe.

405
00:27:10.741 --> 00:27:15.060
Maybe one orange this month.
Yeah,
of course,
man.
But here's the thing.

406
00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:16.950
When when the nuclear holocaust comes,

407
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:20.160
guess he's going to fucking survive that shit because of,

408
00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:24.360
because of my communist upbringing.
I'm bread for tragedy.

409
00:27:24.361 --> 00:27:27.270
I'm bread for the emergency stuff.

410
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:31.170
I'm telling you all this top talks.
Got me too excited.
I got it.

411
00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:32.500
I got to dial it down something.

412
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:36.020
<v 6>Hello,
my name is Allen Gonzales and I'm the radiation specialists here,</v>

413
00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.850
Berkeley nucleonics.

414
00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.960
Today we're very excited to introduce one of our latest innovations here at

415
00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.970
Berkeley nucleonics or Sam Mobile,

416
00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:47.360
one 50 you're at Berkeley nucleonics.

417
00:27:47.361 --> 00:27:49.640
We offer a wide array of instruments,

418
00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:55.250
pagers to handheld survey meters,
Ah,
to portable ice tub identifiers.

419
00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:58.370
Now Banana find critical matter radiation system.

420
00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:02.030
The Sam will will one 50 comes standards,
a newborn baby.
They're large.

421
00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:06.110
So I picked that up yet the texture,
if you do require neutron,

422
00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:10.220
we offer two options.
Okay.
Healing and three and a solid state.

423
00:28:10.221 --> 00:28:14.930
And you're trying to to her in for that added sensitivity.
We all,
you can also

424
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:18.440
large volume,
I believe.
How boring

425
00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:22.650
<v 4>he's stammering.
So smart.
Yeah.
Isn't that crazy?</v>

426
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.070
Just to even consider how smart this guy is.
Oh my God.

427
00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:31.130
I mean this guy's capacity to process the information in about this product is

428
00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:40.620
so beyond,
this is really a,
a brain thing.
Like,
you know.
Yeah,

429
00:28:40.621 --> 00:28:44.350
no,
no.
This is an intelligence level cradle.
You Shit.
Yeah.

430
00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.920
I mean he's boring as a box of rocks,
but yeah.
But my God,
now,

431
00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:52.450
do you think if Anthony Hopkins got this dialogue,

432
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.100
you could make this exciting?
Yeah,
I think he could.

433
00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:59.640
I think anything I was going to make anything extra.
He really can.

434
00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:04.410
He was so great.
Heard of a fucking movie.
Yeah.
So social

435
00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:09.650
<v 6>solace,
solace,
I think it's called the Sam mobile one 15 utilizes our stairs.</v>

436
00:29:09.651 --> 00:29:13.580
VR APP peak with Picos new algorithm.

437
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:17.180
You can easily
identify it,

438
00:29:17.181 --> 00:29:22.020
determine whether it's special nuclear material,
industrial or even medical aid.

439
00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:25.640
How much money do you think he's going to move that?
Attach a photo,

440
00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:30.130
how much money and send it back to your reach back.
It's very strange.

441
00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:35.440
<v 4>Jack reacher around,
he saw the movie,
we saw that movie or reach or reach back.</v>

442
00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:38.980
We've seen nothing but turds either watching shit.

443
00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:44.080
Well the problem is we don't have much time.
We have to like choose quickly,

444
00:29:44.081 --> 00:29:48.900
but there's not a lot of good options on the movies,
flicks or iTunes.
I know,

445
00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:51.880
man.
Yeah,
we saw in Fart.
No.

446
00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:56.260
Which is the same guy that Did da Vinci Code.

447
00:29:56.261 --> 00:30:00.350
Dan Brown Vinci load with Da Vinci load is um,
you know,
as,

448
00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:04.990
as really popular book.
It sold,
I don't know,
hundred million copies.
You read it.

449
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.480
You liked that book.
I thought that that book is a fun read.

450
00:30:07.481 --> 00:30:12.280
And here's what it is.
It's,
it is like perfectly accessible,

451
00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:16.750
uh,
foofy mystery,
thriller type.

452
00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:20.950
And it has like enough interesting bits and he writes everything.
Cliffhanger.

453
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:22.630
You know,
it's,
it's,
it's a writing style,

454
00:30:22.631 --> 00:30:26.730
but the end of every chapter you would go,
I got to read the next year.
Yeah.

455
00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.290
So it's so good.
There was like,
there's just a style to that.
Right.

456
00:30:30.291 --> 00:30:35.230
And there's just the way that he writes and just a fun read.

457
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:39.490
Really captivating.
That movie was fucking dog shit.

458
00:30:39.491 --> 00:30:42.550
Eventually load or the load was dog shit.

459
00:30:42.551 --> 00:30:46.450
And they find the load at the end of the,
and the end of the,
the,
the movie,

460
00:30:46.451 --> 00:30:48.670
what it is is Da Vinci's great.
Great,
great,

461
00:30:48.671 --> 00:30:53.050
great grandson comes all over Tom Hanks face and he goes,
that's what my great,

462
00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:54.790
great,
great,
great granddad wanted to tell you.

463
00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:58.500
And that's the meaning of the Davinci load eventually load.
No.
Wow.

464
00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:03.730
That movie I cannot believe performed that well at the box office because it is

465
00:31:03.731 --> 00:31:06.580
a fucking pile of shit next to that book.

466
00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:09.130
Then they had uh,

467
00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:13.150
angels and come demons and then in Fart,
no.
Came out.

468
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:17.080
And did you see angels and calm?
I think I did.

469
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:21.130
I think I did no Audrey tattoo in it because she probably,

470
00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:27.160
I don't remember.
I don't think she was probably in a second.
But in Fart,

471
00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:31.660
no is like,
it's more of the same.
It's kind of casual,
like it's,

472
00:31:31.661 --> 00:31:34.990
it's something you can just kill time with.
Right.
Watching.

473
00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:37.600
But that's what we look for at the end of the day.

474
00:31:37.601 --> 00:31:40.120
We were hanging out with baby jeans all,
you know,
you're tired,

475
00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:41.380
you don't want to focus.

476
00:31:41.381 --> 00:31:44.010
So that's why we've been picking these kind of dopey movies.
Yeah.

477
00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:48.490
And someone fart now.
I fell asleep about 20 minutes into yeah.

478
00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:51.460
And it was no good.
And you're saying it's all right.
It's not that bad.

479
00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:56.470
I mean it's not,
it's big budget.
You know,
they have good actors.

480
00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:01.010
That goes a long way as we've noticed that
dog shit.

481
00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:06.880
It's um,
it's tough to sit through some of these folks.
We,
we,

482
00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:11.910
so we rented solace with Anthony Hopkins who is the god of acting.

483
00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:14.530
That's so good.
Yeah.

484
00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:19.300
But they cast the supporting actors that were just not great then that was the

485
00:32:19.301 --> 00:32:20.100
carry their weight.

486
00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:23.980
A big thing that stood out about jack reach around to reach all the way through

487
00:32:23.981 --> 00:32:28.630
all the way back is that the whole supporting cast were like terror turds,

488
00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:32.680
like fucking local one o one actors.

489
00:32:32.681 --> 00:32:36.010
They were just like not good.
And all these guys,

490
00:32:36.011 --> 00:32:39.920
the supporting actors in in solace were terrible.

491
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.430
<v 3>Terrible.
Plus the check that's supposed to be the cop.</v>

492
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:47.330
She was super blonde and hot and her clothes were too tight.

493
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.870
Like she wore like the,
the button down.
But it was so tie in,

494
00:32:50.871 --> 00:32:53.750
her pants are so tight.
I was like,
oh,
so distribute buddy in that movie.

495
00:32:53.751 --> 00:32:57.200
You had to think that this is going to be a big hit.
I think about that.

496
00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:01.360
Well it should have been,
the script was good for neutral thriller.
Yeah.

497
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:05.030
And the director though,
that's what ruined it.
I think he ruined the movie.

498
00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.430
I think so too.
I think he,
uh,

499
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:11.300
I think he put his calm and the shots,

500
00:33:11.301 --> 00:33:15.170
like I tried to do too much and you know what I really hate is the shaky cam

501
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:16.840
where they make it like,
ah,

502
00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:21.920
so actiony it's a floating camera and that it's like bouncing behind the couch,

503
00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:27.230
up and down.
So the couch comes into frame sometimes,

504
00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:33.010
but then he would cut to from that to another camera that's clearly on sticks.

505
00:33:33.351 --> 00:33:35.990
Just picking up the side of the profile.

506
00:33:35.991 --> 00:33:40.610
And you're like me being consistent about that point.
I remember watch,

507
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:44.990
there was one scene between Anthony Hopkins and the other guy,

508
00:33:44.991 --> 00:33:49.160
the supporting actor and half the fucking frame is the couch,

509
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:53.930
the cushion,
half the fucking shot.
You want to see a bad movie?
Dammit.

510
00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:58.650
Solis.
That's what it's called,
right?
Solace.
Solace,
yeah.

511
00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:02.970
Let's see.
Solace.
But I liked the idea of it.
I liked the,
you know,

512
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:04.790
the paranormal or the,

513
00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:09.050
I liked that he's an intuitive and he could solve crimes with using his psychic

514
00:34:09.051 --> 00:34:13.560
powers.
I liked that kind of stuff,
you know?
But yeah,
so fucking lame.

515
00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:17.370
That's not a good movie.
Jeffrey Dean Morgan,
he's the guy that,
uh,

516
00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:21.470
started Jeffrey Dean sausages.
He's the guy that plays the actor.

517
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:27.530
Jimmy Dean May.
Oh No.
Yeah,

518
00:34:27.531 --> 00:34:32.240
that's the whole foods plant.
Yeah,
that's Jeffrey Organic.
He,

519
00:34:32.241 --> 00:34:33.074
um,

520
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:38.230
he has all the sausages and he gives him away premise of it as a nonprofit

521
00:34:39.081 --> 00:34:43.220
sausage.
Yeah.
Organization.
And the chick is,
I mean,
she's lovely to look.

522
00:34:43.221 --> 00:34:47.250
She's very pretty,
but it was so like,
bitch,
you ain't no cop.
Not,

523
00:34:47.251 --> 00:34:50.480
not like the cops I've seen in La and he was two,

524
00:34:50.481 --> 00:34:54.380
he didn't look like a copy there.
That's weird.

525
00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:58.070
And I fell asleep through that one too.
Yeah.
This,

526
00:34:58.071 --> 00:35:01.040
this was a man and then we were looking at,

527
00:35:01.041 --> 00:35:06.041
we were so desperate that we even considered a vin diesel movie and it had a 13%

528
00:35:06.861 --> 00:35:11.840
rotten tomatoes,
one three 13% approval rating.

529
00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:16.370
So,
and I thought,
well,
this,
this has to be the dumbest thing too dumb.

530
00:35:16.371 --> 00:35:17.060
Here's a clip.

531
00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:21.020
<v 6>The same moment.
One 50 can adapt to a wide array of applications,</v>

532
00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:25.490
whether it be a sporting event or even a large radiation spill.

533
00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:28.700
Sam Mobile,
one 50 will fit in your vehicle.

534
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:33.050
And your boat or even in a helicopter,
a large surveying areas.

535
00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:35.670
<v 3>I don't understand why.
There you go.
That was super boring.</v>

536
00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:40.560
Thank you for sending that.
This,
the Super Boarding San Mobile,

537
00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:44.460
pretty easy to repurpose that poor guy that had to do this thing.

538
00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:47.610
I know you realize that that was,
that's the best,

539
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:52.070
most outgoing speaker in that department.
That guy extrovert.
Yeah.

540
00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:58.140
Um,
yeah,
that,
that remember how fucking witch hunter,

541
00:35:58.141 --> 00:36:02.340
is that what it was called?
Hunter.
That's the Vin diesel movie.
And I thought,

542
00:36:02.341 --> 00:36:05.850
you know,
I've never watched a vin diesel movie.
Amaze.
We'll give it a try.

543
00:36:05.851 --> 00:36:08.690
He can't be that bad.
He's,
you know,
he's in everything.
Oh yeah.

544
00:36:08.691 --> 00:36:10.170
It's called the last witch hunter.

545
00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:13.230
<v 0>It's exciting.</v>

546
00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:18.260
<v 3>That's not it.
I like is I,
I,
you know,</v>

547
00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:21.110
I can tolerate then diesel if it's a good enough movie.

548
00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:26.060
I liked that movie with the Rock.
The one or the big earthquake happens.

549
00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:30.350
Yeah,
I saw that in theater.
I laughed so hard.
It was really funny.

550
00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:35.360
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

551
00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.070
<v 3>Oh yeah.
Michael Caine's in this,</v>

552
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:43.000
<v 0>my fair share of it.
This thing is 10 million views.
Your story.</v>

553
00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:45.883
End

554
00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:53.970
of the accident.
Cross,

555
00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.990
<v 3>but see,
I'm into it so far.
Okay.</v>

556
00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:58.943
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

557
00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:08.060
Into next
for natural.
I like that.

558
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.630
<v 3>Hello?
Which hunter?</v>

559
00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:26.803
<v 0>What's your car?</v>

560
00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:32.860
<v 3>I see.
Yeah.
This is already lost to me
now.</v>

561
00:37:32.861 --> 00:37:37.000
I want to see it really well be hunted.
Get it.

562
00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:41.110
There's witches and then there's hunters and he's the witch hunter.
No,

563
00:37:41.111 --> 00:37:42.100
I understand that part.

564
00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:46.710
<v 0>This</v>

565
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:51.710
<v 3>is a shorter trailer then we saw the problem is they gave us too much movie and</v>

566
00:37:52.381 --> 00:37:56.520
your,
that's when you can see what a turn it is to trim down your shit trailer.

567
00:37:56.550 --> 00:38:00.230
It could be a decent trailer.
That's true.
True,
true.
Yeah.
Yeah.

568
00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:04.440
We saw a different one.
What else did we see?
We saw in Fart.
No,

569
00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:08.850
we saw solace.
We saw one more.

570
00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:14.130
One other Turd.
Yeah.
Then you write it down.
No,
I thought you wrote it down.

571
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:19.170
Let me see.
In no vin diesel songs.
There was one more that we saw.

572
00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:24.060
No,
no,
that's it buddy and fart now.
Sorry.
Fifth.

573
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:26.280
Yeah,
and foreign.
It was not that bad.
Honestly.

574
00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:30.150
Watch deck Chloe Kardashians show awhile back.
I honestly,

575
00:38:30.151 --> 00:38:32.180
that was better than everything.
We just talked about,

576
00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:37.150
I'm not a huge herd ashy and fan,
but that revenge body we watch was okay.

577
00:38:37.151 --> 00:38:40.300
It's like people getting into shape to get revenge on somebody,

578
00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:43.600
but ultimately they discover that they should just do it for themselves.

579
00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:48.100
That's a great concept.
Yeah.
We should get,
we don't have a series to get into.

580
00:38:48.101 --> 00:38:49.840
That's the problem.
I know.
And there's actually,
yeah.

581
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:52.180
<v 4>Too many out.
That's the other thing.
It's overwhelming.</v>

582
00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:57.720
I feel like every time I go on Netflix now I see 25 original series and I'm

583
00:38:58.691 --> 00:39:00.310
like,
what?
How do they,

584
00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:02.450
<v 3>I don't know how to get it cranking them out.
Right.</v>

585
00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:06.270
And the thing is that there's like super good quality shit on Netflix and then

586
00:39:06.271 --> 00:39:10.110
there's like totally Rancho de Movie,

587
00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:14.190
lifetime movie of the week stuff on there.
We were like,
wait,
what?
Whose quality?

588
00:39:14.191 --> 00:39:18.270
Controlling this shit.
I know.
It's there.
So weird stuff on there.

589
00:39:18.271 --> 00:39:19.680
And then there's like great stuff.

590
00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:24.600
<v 4>Speaking of ups that show the,
uh,</v>

591
00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.380
the one that Chloe did.
Okay.

592
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:29.040
<v 3>Um,
how does,</v>

593
00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:33.440
it kind of reminds me of the fab battle that I had with Bart and a,

594
00:39:33.441 --> 00:39:36.350
I've extended the fat shaming to our president.

595
00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.390
<v 4>So,
um,</v>

596
00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:43.770
just like so many of you fat shamed myself and burnt Chrysler.
Uh,

597
00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:49.120
yeah.
And it worked though because we,
we,
we both got motivated.
Yeah.
Um,

598
00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:54.130
I'm hoping to extend the same favor to our medically obese president of the

599
00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:59.330
United States,
but I'm doing something really nice.

600
00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:04.640
I am donating all of my profit on the Trump is fat shirts

601
00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:09.410
<v 3>to charity.
Very nice.
The starlight foundation,
so,
oh,
wonderful.
There it is.</v>

602
00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:14.390
Uh,
Trump is fat.
He is very fat and he has suits don't fit him well.

603
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:16.990
Yeah.
He,
well,
he's doing something.
It's a,
it's a fat guy

604
00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:21.450
<v 4>move.
I know all the fact that it moves.
Yeah.
Um,
you know,
dark suits,
big cut.</v>

605
00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:23.280
You tries to obscure.

606
00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:27.380
<v 3>Oh,
you're,
you're pear shaped,
but he needs all the tricks.</v>

607
00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:31.490
Taylor a little bit maybe.
Yeah.
And he can afford it.
He's just,
um,

608
00:40:31.491 --> 00:40:35.120
he's trying to,
he's trying to act like he's got his,
you know,

609
00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:39.260
his skinny jeans on.
Yeah.
But he really just needs to drop some weight.

610
00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:43.400
He is very fat and for the sake of the country,
he should be losing weight.

611
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:47.870
That's all I'm saying.
That's all I'm saying.
Big Old Fatty.

612
00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:53.150
<v 4>Um,
yeah.
So get one and uh,
you'll see they get one.</v>

613
00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:57.020
You just go to [inaudible] dot com.
Click on the store and you'll see the uh,

614
00:40:57.350 --> 00:40:59.510
I'll make a big thing when,
um,
you know,

615
00:40:59.511 --> 00:41:04.280
when we've sold the get done selling them,
we're going to donate the proceeds.

616
00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:07.520
Um,
exciting.
Yeah.
I'm doing this starlight foundation.

617
00:41:07.521 --> 00:41:12.100
It's a charity for a terminally ill children.
Oh Wow.

618
00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:14.390
That's pretty good.
This was surprising to me.

619
00:41:14.391 --> 00:41:16.720
I didn't expect the president to come out with this,
but he

620
00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:22.020
<v 7>good afternoon America.

635
00:42:22.581 --> 00:42:23.660

I'll tell you.
It's a little Trump.

638
00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.960
I don't think it's an apostrophe.

639
00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:40.390
S is it l I apostrophe ll for low level?

640

643
00:42:53.211 --> 00:42:56.960
If you want to support little Trump nineties,
he's on Instagram.

644
00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:01.160
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah,
that's it.
You got to know a,</v>

645
00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:06.750
you got a little too Maktoum low friends,
honey rush.

646
00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:11.630
These are watching him for monks.
The lushly jewel for snitches,

647
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:18.250
and I told my friends over there,
we got some shit.
We meet you in the flow.
Yes,

648
00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:22.910
thanks to my friend Tony Calling the people chattering.

649
00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:24.470
David once told me,

650
00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:29.240
don't get your hands too close to the top when you fee because they could take

651
00:43:29.241 --> 00:43:33.280
the skin.
Well after you failed in less than a couple of steps

652
00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:38.240
I made you look at this.

653
00:43:38.241 --> 00:43:40.540
Give me a tiny moon and ma'am,

654
00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:45.060
I need you to go look Trump names and give me some names.
Okay.

655
00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:49.110
I don't know what the name,
how.
Thinking back to smaller one in here.

656
00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:53.900
We've named him being Sochi,
but I don't know.

657
00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:57.500
It doesn't seem to be off on Nana could give us some names.

658
00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:02.330
We've already infiltrated little Trump nineties yeah.
Fat

659
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:07.520
Bird is fat Chrysler from Russia.
All right.

660
00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:13.570
<v 4>His wig is right on though.
His Wig.
His,
yeah,
his outfits just totally right.</v>

661
00:44:13.571 --> 00:44:16.990
You have to go to just so you can get,
if you have only this guy,

662
00:44:16.991 --> 00:44:21.070
you definitely have to get a loan with him.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The whole joke is the look.

663
00:44:21.071 --> 00:44:25.570
He looks fantastic.
What jokes,
right?
Oh,
sorry.
I'm sorry.
Ah,
little Trump nineties.

664
00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:28.900
Well,
Trump.
Yeah.
Well Trump,
he's doing his thing and stuff like that.

665
00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:36.180
Why the nineties?
I wonder.
I have no idea anything was happening with this man.

666
00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:39.540
We build a wall.
You're going to keep the motherfuckers out.

667
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:46.590
Uh,
I dunno the motherfuckers out.
Yeah.
Um,

668
00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:51.030
so this was submitted as a vocal fry clip.
You know,
we were always,

669
00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:55.100
you know,
participated in,
in um,

670
00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:59.520
highlighting a severe vocal fry.
Um,

671
00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:05.100
where's one of our great vocal fry guys is of course a,

672
00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.770
Oh my God.
Yeah.

673
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:13.580
Steven Segall and also the guy from the swinger show or whatever.

674
00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:18.930
That is so incredible.
That's a,
what does that show again?

675
00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:23.970
The poly by show.
That's a polyamory.
Yeah.
And he's like,

676
00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:27.930
ah,
two girls,

677
00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:31.080
uh,
back guys.
This is,

678
00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:35.940
this is the most vocal fry I've ever heard in a meeting or actually maybe in a

679
00:45:35.941 --> 00:45:38.520
human,
I don't think I've actually heard a woman this level.

680
00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:42.370
<v 8>Well,
Megan and I have been together for nearly three years.</v>

681
00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:44.980
She's a beautiful girl who I am very much in love with.

682
00:45:44.981 --> 00:45:48.400
And I have a lot in common with,
I can't wait to get home and jump in a pool.

683
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:51.660
<v 4>That guy,
by the way,</v>

684
00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:55.680
is basically a murderer without a weapon.

685
00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:59.690
He is a world class Muy Thai fighter.
Um,

686
00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:04.010
champion in,
I forget what category,
but that dude,

687
00:46:04.011 --> 00:46:05.760
that's the funny thing is you hear this voice and you're like,

688
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:09.960
fuck this dude and that dude would kill you.
Yeah.

689
00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:13.350
That's interesting.
Your hands is that he's not a sissy.

690
00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:18.630
This guy can be the opposite.
The opposite.
Let's go in the pool.

691
00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:23.130
Now.
How about this guy?
This guy has appeal voice to the pool.

692
00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:25.800
<v 8>Thoughts wanting to control them.</v>

693
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:32.210
I don't know how to put it.
Uh,
uh,

694
00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:35.480
assessed them permanently and that's why you kept them all right.

695
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.120
<v 4>Right,
right,
right.
Oh,
that's your favorite Jeffrey Dahmer?
Not my favorite.</v>

696
00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:42.640
Which one's your favorite?
I don't have a favorite.

697
00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:45.100
He's got those cool sunglasses.
I mean they cold glasses.

698
00:46:45.101 --> 00:46:49.230
You liked it ever really cool glass.
It's got cool hair.
Cool glasses.
Yeah.
Yeah.

699
00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:51.770
Really cool.
Jeffrey Dahmer?
Yeah.

700
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.050
I want to say I was living there when they got him and where?
Milwaukee,

701
00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:00.400
Milwaukee,
I think I lived there when they got them.
How's it [inaudible] 93.

702
00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:06.370
<v 8>And uh,
as my obsession grew,
uh,</v>

703
00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:11.400
go,
uh,
it was saving body parts such as skulls,

704
00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:13.920
skeletons.

705
00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:17.490
<v 4>Uh Oh,
he really fessed up to that.
Yeah.</v>

706
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:22.700
You seldom hear them really fess up to it.
So he must be proud of it.

707
00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:26.840
I don't know.
They don't really,
they don't ever admit sometimes.
I mean at least,

708
00:47:26.841 --> 00:47:29.080
and I was the shows you forced me to watch

709
00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:32.530
<v 3>the killers go.
Why didn't really do that?</v>

710
00:47:32.531 --> 00:47:36.550
Or they'll admit to like one or two things.
Yeah,
I killed my mom,

711
00:47:36.551 --> 00:47:38.810
but this was one statistic.
One of the,
yeah,

712
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:42.660
<v 8>no,
that's a process.
It doesn't happen overnight.
Uh,</v>

713
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:44.830
when you a nice hair,

714
00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:49.890
you personalize a another person and he was in as just an object and the object

715
00:47:51.551 --> 00:47:56.530
for pleasure instead of a living,
breathing human being,
uh,

716
00:47:57.330 --> 00:48:01.870
it,
it
seems to make it easier to

717
00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:05.680
do things you shouldn't do.

718
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:11.140
<v 3>What part of this was funny?
I was just pointing out the vocal fry.
Next clip.</v>

719
00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:15.090
Thanks a nice,

720
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:19.270
we've figured out Jeffrey Dahmer has vocal.
I'm so happy.

721
00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:24.730
Let's highlight this guy more.
Can we know he's a horrible person.
He's dead.

722
00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:28.270
How is he?
Yeah.
When did he die?
Oh,
a number of years ago.

723
00:48:28.271 --> 00:48:31.210
He was beat to death in prison.
Oh good.
Yeah.
No,
that's excellent.

724
00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:35.320
Beat him with a broomstick to death.
Good.
That's a vicious beating.
Sure.
As well.

725
00:48:35.321 --> 00:48:38.980
Some of the stuff he did was pretty vicious to right.
Uh,
yeah.
That's uh,

726
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.800
that's uh,
yeah,
it says here,
Jimmy Dean sausage,

727
00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:46.080
Jeffrey Dean Morgan sausages are a free team working.

728
00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:51.550
Um,
and then Morgan Stanley sausages to Morgan Stanley sauce.
Um,

729
00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:54.790
he was killed in [inaudible] 94 all it's been a long time ago.

730
00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:58.510
Are you sad that day when you found out?
Fuck no,
that guy was horrible,
man.

731
00:48:58.511 --> 00:49:01.780
Let's see.
Uh,
just cause I can remember it now.
He was arrested in [inaudible] 91.

732
00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:05.470
Okay.
Fif is sleeping in my arms.
Yeah.

733
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:11.080
But the trial maybe happen then later the sea trial began and [inaudible] 92

734
00:49:11.081 --> 00:49:12.010
January [inaudible] 92.

735
00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:13.950
<v 2>Okay.
Uh,</v>

736
00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:18.920
<v 3>was real to be sane,
not suffering from mental illness.</v>

737
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:20.060
I don't know if I'd agree with that.

738
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:24.440
I'd say he's suffering from mental illness now.
Fif is so cute.

739
00:49:24.441 --> 00:49:27.230
Look how he's sleeping on me right now.
That's a really hard time.

740
00:49:27.231 --> 00:49:30.980
I know he is the kiss easiest person in this house.
Yeah,

741
00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:36.380
I'm really cute.
I'd say actually Betsey's Kissy or than Fif.

742
00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:39.470
Like she demands the kisses in the morning.

743
00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:43.220
She rams her head and to me and she's like,
pet me,
pet me,
pet me,
pet me.

744
00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:46.310
Have you had any beef?
Does it too,
by the way?
No.
Just so I'm clear.

745
00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:49.940
I was there then that year.
Oh,
that's too bad.
You missed each other.

746
00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:55.160
I was a little young for him.
I think we moved there in seventh grade.
Wow.

747
00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:57.650
Yeah.
Well you guys could have been BFFs.

748
00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:00.710
Could of could have gone to the mall with him.
Yeah.

749
00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:03.763
<v 2>Huh?</v>

750
00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:08.670
<v 3>Do you think fif misses you?
He loves me.
He loves you.
He's Super Kissy.
You,</v>

751
00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:12.750
however,
not very kissy.
Why do you say that?
Well,

752
00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:16.770
I just said lately that I've been kissy or towards you,

753
00:50:16.771 --> 00:50:19.860
like I demand in the pets and the kids is like I'm sweeter to you and then

754
00:50:19.861 --> 00:50:23.070
you're just kinda like you kind of an alone dog.

755
00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:27.980
Like you kind of look out the window.
Like I would say if we're doing a

756
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:32.100
<v 4>rundown no of the house of who's the Cassius.
Yeah,</v>

757
00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:34.340
we include everybody.
Go ahead.
Okay,

758
00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:39.680
so we'll say most kissy at the top.
That'd be bitsy.
She's the CAHSEE yesterday.

759
00:50:39.681 --> 00:50:44.120
Yeah.
Second most would probably be FIFO.
Yeah.

760
00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:48.590
But he's a distant second in a way.
Cause she's well to her,

761
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:51.850
she's so affectionate.
She so sweet.
All this.

762
00:50:51.851 --> 00:50:55.730
He really does demand the pets and loves all she wants.
That's all she wants.
Yes.

763
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:59.010
Then no,

764
00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:02.990
then you're not kissy at all.
Your Anti Kissy,

765
00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:07.310
you're Jeffrey Dahmer.
Kissy Kissy Kissy.

766
00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:11.690
He's like fuck out of here.
Yeah,

Lj does not,

767
00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:13.660

768
00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:18.710
he comes up to you sometimes if he's tired he'll let you squeeze them,
kiss it.

769
00:51:18.711 --> 00:51:21.140
But most of the time he's like,
fuck out of here.
Okay.
I got to walk.

770
00:51:21.141 --> 00:51:22.620
I got some shit to do.
Okay.

771
00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:27.780
Is that normal that our son just like doesn't want the kisses?
Yeah.

772
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.760
He says that's his first word.
It's so weird as fuck you.

774
00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:40.650

I think it's normal.
Right?
What?
The toddlers that age,
they're just like,
Ma,

775
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:44.550
they don't know yet that he doesn't know what she sees her.
Awesome.
Yeah.
Yeah.

776
00:51:44.551 --> 00:51:48.900
But hearing not as a function as I am.

That is the dumbest conversation between two people.
I've taught me.

Would you marry your dad?
There you go.

<v 3>That's so perfect that he did that.</v>

831
00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:53.150
How do you know if you're in front of a Polish firing squad?

832
00:55:54.070 --> 00:55:59.020
<v 10>I think that's true.
Uh,
the guns are faced at the,</v>

833
00:55:59.050 --> 00:56:00.060
uh,
Guy,

834
00:56:00.370 --> 00:56:04.560
<v 3>Dad,
Dad,
dad.
Do you not understand how these work?</v>

835
00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:08.000
You're not supposed to actually try to answer them.

836
00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:12.500
He always does.
I know.
He tries to guess the answers.

837
00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:22.220
Oh my God.
When I spoke with him the other morning,
he goes,
Hey,

838
00:56:22.221 --> 00:56:26.260
Christina,
audio like it,
the country's being run by all white guys.

839
00:56:27.590 --> 00:56:31.600
Really?
Yeah.
He,
he was,
he knows I'm super,
you know,
lefty,
California.

840
00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:34.710
He thinks we're all crazy.
It's so funny.
He tells me all the time.

841
00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:39.450
<v 2>You didn't know it.
Now you know why I'm so crazy about,
yeah,</v>

842
00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:44.570
yeah,
yeah.
It was done.
I,
I,
yes,
I understand that.
I love you.
I know.

843
00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:46.400
I get it.
You get it out.

844
00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:51.360
<v 3>He said that to me.
Now you're ina 90 mls.</v>

845
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:55.020
Do you understand why I just love Tommy so much.
That's such a cute little shit.

846
00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:59.750
Dammit.
He used to say to me,
daddy car me Gargan me Daddy.

847
00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:05.050
<v 2>Just pick me up with Spanish.
I learned that.
Yes,
dad,</v>

848
00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:10.380
<v 3>it's amazing that he's been with a Spanish speaker for 40 years and he doesn't</v>

849
00:57:10.381 --> 00:57:12.600
really beautiful Spanish.
Yeah.

850
00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:17.340
This speaks absolutely the most elegant and gorgeous Spanish.
Hmm.

851
00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:18.670
It's really moving.
Is that what you

852
00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:21.993
<v 2>cause that's how I</v>

853
00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:27.520
<v 3>Garg may daddy card of my walk a block and you'd say Cargill May,</v>

854
00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:31.280
you know,
we have to do is have him speak Spanish for us next time.

855
00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:33.540
That would be really a fantastic,
yeah.

856
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:38.300
We should have him just read some common Spanish phrases.
He'll be like,
uh,

857
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:44.840
tango.
I'm bright.
He says how?
He says,
Eh,

858
00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:46.980
maybe the dangle I'll break.

859
00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:51.510
Your dad is so,
um,

860
00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:54.360
he just hates adapting to any other culture.

861
00:57:54.361 --> 00:57:59.361
It's so interesting that he married that and he just hates like the traveling

862
00:57:59.551 --> 00:58:02.210
thing.
Yeah.
You know,
like he doesn't know.

863
00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:04.920
He doesn't want to see any other country because like it's,
it's inconvenient.

864
00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:07.560
Right?
Is that,
is that what it is like,
yeah.

865
00:58:07.590 --> 00:58:11.640
He can't watch this convenient movies.
Does that expression a lot?
Yeah.

866
00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:15.720
I'm all about convenience.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
I get it.
But you know what?

867
00:58:15.721 --> 00:58:19.410
The older I get,
the more I'm like,
oh yeah.
Why leave?
Why leave the country?

868
00:58:19.411 --> 00:58:24.240
Forget it.
Yeah.
Why leave the fucking house?
Everything's here.
He,

869
00:58:24.241 --> 00:58:28.950
uh,
yeah.
I,
I've been like,
you know,
I don't really want to go to Ellie.
Pretty Sad.

870
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:31.110
Yeah.
Why don't you want to go to Italy?

871
00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:36.290
<v 2>Yeah.
You know,
you're walking in a museum.
See the painting.
All right,
Saad.</v>

872
00:58:38.110 --> 00:58:40.510
Wow.
It's

873
00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:44.830
<v 3>very inspiring and talk to you about this.
I mean,
yeah,
you see it all right.</v>

874
00:58:44.831 --> 00:58:47.470
I saw it.
That's what he said.

875
00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:50.050
I think my dad's the same way though.

876
00:58:50.051 --> 00:58:54.460
Like he only goes to certain kinds of countries like the Philippines or

877
00:58:54.461 --> 00:58:57.370
Thailand.
I mean for the culture.
But like,

878
00:58:57.371 --> 00:59:01.220
he wouldn't go to a Europe now for culture or the,

879
00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:04.620
either he's over it.
He's like,
ah,
fuck that shit.

880
00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:09.700
The only place he hasn't been,
that he wants to go.
Um,
and this is like a stretch,

881
00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:12.700
but I think he,
you know,
he's still considered going.

882
00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:16.300
Is England specifically your dad?
Yeah.
Oh my doubt.

883
00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:21.230
Never go London is there like us to speak English?
I'm like,
yeah.
Okay.
Yeah,

884
00:59:21.231 --> 00:59:22.250
he likes it because they speak

885
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:25.400
<v 4>English.
Everything's smaller though.
It's still Europe.</v>

886
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:27.110
I know he wouldn't like that,

887
00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:32.170
but my dad is also a history buff so he would love to go Churchill's bunker and

888
00:59:32.301 --> 00:59:36.440
shit like that.
I mean there's not a World War II show he has not indulged in,

889
00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:40.540
in the last 40 years.
So yeah,
I think he would enjoy it.
I you,

890
00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:45.770
he might actually enjoy going is Berlin cause it's Hitler Shit crowds.

891
00:59:47.631 --> 00:59:51.950
I don't know.
I mean I don't think maybe maybe Berlin Wall,

892
00:59:51.951 --> 00:59:56.220
you've got Hitler's bunker but it's uncomfortable to travel with him cause

893
00:59:56.270 --> 01:00:00.590
because you sense how unhappy he is and the food's weird.

894
01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:03.970
The catch that doesn't taste right.
Yeah.
And it's like he's the kind of person,

895
01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:08.000
like he doesn't sit still.
He kind of like,
yeah.
Moves back and forth,
you know,

896
01:00:08.830 --> 01:00:11.720
change.
It,
puts the left leg,
the crosses over the right,

897
01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:16.040
and then 30 seconds later he moves right to left and then left to right and then

898
01:00:16.041 --> 01:00:18.680
right to left.
And you go like,
you're right.
And he's like,
yeah,

899
01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:23.470
you've moved a lot in the last year.
And he's like,
yeah,
you can comfortable like,

900
01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:27.830
okay,
he,
and it's bad.
I mean,
that's a small example,
but it's,

901
01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:32.110
it's that in everything.
And it goes like this.
He goes,
yeah,

902
01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:37.160
he crossed his arms,
he crosses his arms,
moves the,
uh,

903
01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:41.720
the forks and the knives.
He lines up the forks and the knives,

904
01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:45.200
just them a bunch.
And then you just sense that he's,
um,

905
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:49.450
he's always kind of like a,
basically like you ready to go?
Yeah.

906
01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:51.020
It's always the next thing.

907
01:00:51.070 --> 01:00:54.470
Like he's always ready to go on and do the next thing.
Not to see.

908
01:00:54.471 --> 01:00:57.230
That's misleading because it makes us sound like he's more adventurous.

909
01:00:58.130 --> 01:01:00.680
The next thing is when are you ready to go back to the hotel?

910
01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:05.540
He wants to get back to home base,
which I understand it,
but he's a,

911
01:01:05.550 --> 01:01:08.990
he's an extreme version of it because,
you know,
I get that way too.

912
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:13.070
But he's,
he's basically like,
you leave the hotel and he's like,

913
01:01:13.071 --> 01:01:17.990
when do you want to come back?
So like travel with him is just,

914
01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:21.280
Oh my God.
Really?
A lot.
Yeah.

915
01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:25.030
What does he like to do in the hotel?
Um,

916
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:29.180
what are we missing
when he's gone?

917
01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:33.650
I think it's where he just feels at ease.
Yeah.
Say his,

918
01:01:33.651 --> 01:01:38.030
he lays down,
but he still wears his Khakis.
No,
expects them off in a hotel room.

919
01:01:38.031 --> 01:01:40.430
So his boxers,
Oh yeah,
I've seen that.

920
01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:45.820
Boxers and shirt socks and he's got Turner classic movies.

921
01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:50.630
Just go through the channels or some news or something to eat and you go get

922
01:01:50.631 --> 01:01:53.450
something to eat.
And then like,
as,

923
01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:58.040
as his last bite is in his mouth and as you might have a few more,

924
01:01:58.041 --> 01:02:01.920
he was ready to go and you're like,
I'm still eating though.
And you'll,

925
01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:04.760
and then he goes,
okay,
like my,
sorry,
I'm sorry about that.

926
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:08.630
And then you see him like just kind of looking around the room,

927
01:02:08.631 --> 01:02:11.440
like how many more minutes to meet?
You're like,

928
01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:15.740
can we like really dial it back here?
And we really just ease into this.

929
01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:20.010
He's got nothing to say.
You know?
It's not like he's boozing and

930
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:22.650
<v 3>having a good time.
He's,
yeah,
he's all business.
He's like,
well,</v>

931
01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:26.370
let's get in and get out,
man.
He's also just board.
Yeah,

932
01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:29.100
that's what he told me.
He's told me that before too.

933
01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.670
He doesn't like talking to people.
He's like,
you know Sheena,
I just,

934
01:02:32.671 --> 01:02:35.160
I don't like talking to me and people,
people bore me.
You know what I mean?

935
01:02:35.161 --> 01:02:37.900
They warned me like,
thank you for telling me that.
He's told me.
He's like,
yeah,

936
01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:41.210
<v 4>I go,
you know,
my friend was saying,
blah,
Blah Blah to you.
And he goes,</v>

937
01:02:41.211 --> 01:02:46.100
he's boring.
I go,
can you pretend

938
01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:52.930
just for like the sake of you no decency and to make somebody feel like they're

939
01:02:54.171 --> 01:02:56.810
not boring.
Yeah.
I like to do that.

940
01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.370
<v 3>He walks away mid conversation.
Oh yeah.
I've seen him do it at parties.</v>

941
01:03:01.790 --> 01:03:04.940
He did at one time.
It cousin,
cousin.
Jeanette's,
um,

942
01:03:05.030 --> 01:03:07.220
when we were on that boat where the sensory fort hat,

943
01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:09.980
it was right before this and sunny fort and we were talking,
he and I,

944
01:03:09.981 --> 01:03:12.460
and I saw him walk away from countless people.

945
01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:15.710
<v 4>I think he's in his own head when he does that,
it's just super in his head,</v>

946
01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:18.980
you know?
Oh,
I respect it by the way.
I respect that too,

947
01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:24.230
because what I do feel like I am a version of my yes.
So,
but the thing is,

948
01:03:24.231 --> 01:03:25.064
yes,

949
01:03:25.070 --> 01:03:29.840
usually with those things were all a toned down version of it.

950
01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:32.870
Like in other words,
he's a 10,
and I'm a five.

951
01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:37.670
And since I recognize it because it's in myself,
when I see it,
I,
it,

952
01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:42.290
it's more enraging to me,
you know what I mean?
Because I actually do it and I go,

953
01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:44.150
that's why it unnerves me,
you know?

954
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:46.030
<v 3>And you've had it done to you your whole life.</v>

955
01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:49.600
So when you do it to somebody else,
it's like,
oh,
I,
I fell into that trap.

956
01:03:49.601 --> 01:03:52.150
I fucking did that man.
Did that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

957
01:03:52.151 --> 01:03:56.160
My Dad's pretty callous with people too.
I remember,
um,

958
01:03:56.350 --> 01:04:00.010
when my dad and I were at my mother's apartment cleaning it out when she died

959
01:04:00.550 --> 01:04:04.720
and my mom got a phone or my mother's phone rang and it kept ringing.

960
01:04:04.721 --> 01:04:08.980
So he picked it up and it was one of her friends,
you know,

961
01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:13.360
and uh,
and my dad just goes,
ah,
he just dead.

962
01:04:13.890 --> 01:04:17.230
Okay.
Got To go,
bye bye.
And just hung up on this woman who was like,

963
01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:23.170
that is brutal man.
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh,
she's dead.

964
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:27.150
Oh,
how did he die?
I don't know.
I'll get by and just like hung up on this.

965
01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:32.290
You imagine being that person.
Wow.
I know.
And I know who it is and I like,

966
01:04:32.291 --> 01:04:35.410
I never called her back.
I should've just fucking called her back.

967
01:04:35.411 --> 01:04:39.480
I have a daughter after her father.
I,

968
01:04:39.550 --> 01:04:43.990
cause I have so many other things,
you know,
cleaning up the place and the well,

969
01:04:43.991 --> 01:04:48.010
and the thing and I that was like,
this is number millions,
unless their shit,

970
01:04:48.011 --> 01:04:48.940
when somebody dies,

971
01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:51.850
call that one person that called while we were cleaning out the apartment.

972
01:04:51.851 --> 01:04:55.330
That's an ice cold dads and a lot of ways,
you know,
uh,
both of us do.
Yeah,
that's,

973
01:04:55.331 --> 01:05:00.331
but that's why you and I are so kissy towards our son and why we're so kissy

974
01:05:00.641 --> 01:05:04.240
towards each other and our lives are different because we know how,

975
01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.920
what a bummer it is to be on the other end of that.
Yeah.

976
01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:08.860
The receiving end of that animal shit.

977
01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:12.370
<v 4>What's up everybody?
All right.
You good?
All right.</v>

978
01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:18.160
<v 3>At least your dad's like,
I'm entertaining and he can</v>

979
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.820
<v 4>kind of plug in.
My Dad's just like straighten narcissist,
you know,</v>

980
01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:26.520
just no one else's needs register ever.
No one else exists in Israel.

981
01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:31.030
Just my dad.
It's his world and if you're not catering to it,

982
01:05:31.031 --> 01:05:35.710
he's got no interest in you.
Just know Andrew,
even Ellis,
he's like,
I go,

983
01:05:35.711 --> 01:05:38.230
do you want to come over and see Ellis?
Ah,

984
01:05:38.650 --> 01:05:42.520
maybe in 40 years when he's doing something,
he's not going by though.

985
01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:47.200
Like five times.
He told me,
he goes,

986
01:05:47.201 --> 01:05:50.410
I can do more in a four or five years.
Right.
That's what I'm saying.

987
01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:54.340
He feels like he shouldn't even visit because the kid's not like entertaining.

988
01:05:55.570 --> 01:05:59.350
I'm using him
speaking of super healthy,

989
01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:04.540
but uh,
health.
Yeah.
I started doing pilots.
You did?

990
01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:08.230
Yeah.
You saw my trainer.
I did.
And what's the verdict?

991
01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:10.970
The verdict is that shit's hard,
man.
Hard as fuck,
Huh?
Yeah.

992
01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:14.880
Here's the thing I've done.
I've done cross farts.

993
01:06:15.730 --> 01:06:19.030
I've had personal trainers,
different ones.
Yeah.
Boxing class.

994
01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:24.850
I've done all those and a,
and I got the thing where I go,
I want to,
you know,

995
01:06:24.851 --> 01:06:26.440
I hear you talking about it and I go,
you know,

996
01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:31.441
I've always associated in heard of pilots [inaudible] as um,

997
01:06:31.870 --> 01:06:36.190
pilates.
Uh,
like a female check workout.

998
01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:39.630
Said you kept talking about I'm going to try it.
So I went over to your,

999
01:06:39.690 --> 01:06:44.690
your trainers place or studio and did a workout and fucking kicked.

1000
01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:47.520
All right.
Well cause uh,

1001
01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:50.560
cause I'd come home from my workouts with her and I'm like,
dude,

1002
01:06:50.561 --> 01:06:53.210
I did like fucking prison pushups today.
I'm like,

1003
01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:57.250
she'll have you do it on like the side of the bar.
Like just fucking present.

1004
01:06:57.251 --> 01:07:01.450
Do it.
And it's hard,
dude.
My,
my muscles collapse when I'm doing.

1005
01:07:01.690 --> 01:07:04.110
It's really a great workout.
Here's the thing is that my God,

1006
01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:07.000
right heart in a workout especially,
you know,

1007
01:07:07.001 --> 01:07:09.370
you get married to doing the same thing.

1008
01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.930
It's totally different and if you've never done it,
um,

1009
01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:17.190
the focus I could say like if your focus of trying to do it is that it focuses

1010
01:07:17.591 --> 01:07:18.640
on your core strength,

1011
01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:23.770
which is for me definitely my weakest,
most peoples.

1012
01:07:23.890 --> 01:07:28.270
So dog shit part,
it's,
it's a,
it's a good struggle.

1013
01:07:28.330 --> 01:07:32.710
It's really challenging.
But uh,
it's holy Shit Brown.

1014
01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:33.460
I know,

1015
01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:38.200
I bet bad sciatica since I had Ellis and that this has helped so much because

1016
01:07:38.201 --> 01:07:42.130
you strengthen all your core muscles and it helps every year aligned mailer.

1017
01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:44.500
Do you like I'll just walk up the stairs now.

1018
01:07:44.501 --> 01:07:47.680
Like holding Ellis and I used to do that like 10 times a day,

1019
01:07:47.681 --> 01:07:51.700
two in our old house and now I just shit like I could fly up there.
By the way,

1020
01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:53.080
it's all endurance stuff.

1021
01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:58.540
Fucking blows Donkey Dick's because you'll do a set of something and you know

1022
01:07:59.481 --> 01:08:03.970
you're having like the resistance of these bands and do 25 reps.

1023
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:08.560
So when you're,
when you hit 25 let's say you go like,
you know,
done,

1024
01:08:08.830 --> 01:08:10.690
done,
and then she'll be like,

1025
01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:14.500
now go into the not chill and then do that.

1026
01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:15.980
Do it immediately.
Yeah.

1027
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:21.140
<v 3>Like go back to your resistance,
do this next thing 25 times and you're like,</v>

1028
01:08:21.141 --> 01:08:25.040
Holy Shit.
And then,
then there's a third one after that.
So the whole,

1029
01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:29.920
it's just like you're continuously doing it.
Yeah,
it's a,
it's,
it's a tough word.

1030
01:08:30.290 --> 01:08:34.700
The thing is though with highlights is that you build your strength fairly

1031
01:08:34.701 --> 01:08:36.920
quickly.
Yeah.
Like when I first came to her,

1032
01:08:36.970 --> 01:08:41.490
I never planked in my life ever.
I don't fucking play.

1033
01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:45.440
Don't make me do [inaudible].
I hate it now I can do one minute,

1034
01:08:45.441 --> 01:08:48.200
like it's nothing.
I don't even feel one minute plank.

1035
01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:51.290
By the end of two minutes I'm like,
all right,
I'm uncomfortable now.

1036
01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:55.540
Like I don't like doing this anymore.
But I mean it happened pretty quickly too.

1037
01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:00.020
Like shit,
your strength gets really gets dark quick.
Yeah.
Oh,

1038
01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:03.770
that's my favorite.
I love on our dogs play.
Yeah.

1039
01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:08.120
It's busy attacking faith.
That's,
that's the plighting his face.

1040
01:09:08.121 --> 01:09:11.690
He's biting her ears,
tail biting.

1041
01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:16.520
Lots of,
cause she's the Kissy is,
yeah.
She's like,
fuck with me.

1042
01:09:16.521 --> 01:09:21.150
Part of me nestles demands.
Yeah.
Okay.

1043
01:09:22.090 --> 01:09:27.050
Um,
well this is nice here.
I thought you would enjoy,
boy,
uh,
this,

1044
01:09:27.051 --> 01:09:28.160
this is everything.
I think we could,

1045
01:09:28.190 --> 01:09:31.970
we could actually get into this the same way we both went to the pilots.

1046
01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:35.010
We can both get into this together.
Oh yeah.

1047
01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:39.600
<v 11>Everyone has sequence,
but some are more complex than others.</v>

1048
01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:43.470
It's kind of like an extension of another persona within me that most go out and

1049
01:09:43.471 --> 01:09:44.304
have fun.

1050
01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:49.090
<v 3>So can you describe what you're seeing and why don't you want to do it's</v>

1051
01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:52.930
ghoulish?
Yeah.
So these are the living dolls.
Oh boy.

1052
01:09:53.650 --> 01:09:58.300
And it appears to be men in full women costumes,

1053
01:09:58.301 --> 01:10:02.020
but with these,
uh,
expressionless doll face,

1054
01:10:02.021 --> 01:10:06.730
it masks on so that,
and there's makeup on them.
Yeah.
So it has that,

1055
01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:12.420
that something that maybe Dahmer would be into very alive.
Yeah.

1056
01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:16.810
Luck it.
It looks,
it looks terrifying.
Yeah.
It looks very ghoulish and terrifying.

1057
01:10:16.830 --> 01:10:17.230
Yeah.

1058
01:10:17.230 --> 01:10:22.230
I would say pup play is Lil Les Ghoulish and terrifying than this living doll.

1059
01:10:22.931 --> 01:10:26.170
Crap.
Without a doubt.
It is less terrifying.

1060
01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:29.000
This is a extremely,
I like others.

1061
01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:33.460
Just a gaggle of these horrifying men and these women costumes going out to a

1062
01:10:33.461 --> 01:10:38.370
bar.
Like anything normal.
Like it's remotely acceptable.
Yeah.
It's,

1063
01:10:38.530 --> 01:10:43.060
I mean,
God dammit.
Why do I have to see this shit?

1064
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:44.560
Yeah,
it's that.
Okay.

1065
01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:49.550
<v 11>Delve into the female Moscow.
Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

1066
01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:53.060
A lot of social pressure to conform.

1067
01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:56.610
<v 3>Oh,
my favorite is,</v>

1068
01:10:56.611 --> 01:11:00.420
did you see when he tried to force the straw in between his doll lips and he was

1069
01:11:00.421 --> 01:11:01.254
like,

1070
01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:06.240
also there is not just a face mask.
Oh boy.

1071
01:11:06.270 --> 01:11:09.030
But is this like a,
there's a bodysuit on us.

1072
01:11:09.031 --> 01:11:14.031
It's a latex body that he's wearing over his regular body and then a bikini on

1073
01:11:14.281 --> 01:11:18.090
top.
He's skinny.
This bit just skinny.
Skinny.
Yeah.

1074
01:11:19.090 --> 01:11:21.600
<v 11>Delve into the secret world of female Moscow.</v>

1075
01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:26.380
Oh boy is a lot of social pressure to conform.

1076
01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:29.870
<v 3>So what to what equate to being a person?</v>

1077
01:11:32.050 --> 01:11:35.610
<v 11>When I dress up and I put this mask on.
Oh my God,
Nice.</v>

1078
01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:37.380
It's like a beautiful woman walking down the street.

1079
01:11:43.670 --> 01:11:47.930
<v 3>Just scare the fuck out of everybody.
The birds are terrifying.</v>

1080
01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:51.500
If you are walking down the street and you,

1081
01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:57.530
you're just like casually walking down and you see,
let's see this fucking night,

1082
01:11:59.250 --> 01:12:00.400
you think a,

1083
01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:05.460
a robbery just took place or was about to take place or B,

1084
01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:11.530
you had stepped into your own nightmare because these are absolutely terrified.

1085
01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:17.450
But these are expressionless faces.
Yeah,
don't move that.

1086
01:12:17.451 --> 01:12:19.280
Have makeup on them.
Ah,

1087
01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:23.000
and basically you're seeing that this is a man's build.

1088
01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:27.020
That's a guy wearing a latex.
Here's the thing,

1089
01:12:27.021 --> 01:12:31.340
if you want to pass for a woman,
then just be a dude who wears makeup.

1090
01:12:31.341 --> 01:12:35.570
Like try to feminize like this is just creepy.
This isn't even fuck is going on.

1091
01:12:35.571 --> 01:12:38.150
You look like a,
a fake woman.
Like a

1092
01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:40.020
<v 11>put this mask on mannequin.
Oh look,</v>

1093
01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.420
it's like a beautiful woman walking down the street.

1094
01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:45.450
<v 3>Oh,
it ain't bro know what you see in the mirror.</v>

1095
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:47.460
I don't know what kind of women you've been looking at.

1096
01:12:47.490 --> 01:12:48.660
They don't look like this,

1097
01:12:51.630 --> 01:12:54.150
but he in his imagination.
Oh,
beautiful woman.

1098
01:12:58.610 --> 01:13:02.310
Yeah,
but their mounts aren't even open.
It's like,
oh,

1099
01:13:02.311 --> 01:13:05.430
I've heard of a woman walking down the three.

1100
01:13:06.170 --> 01:13:09.350
<v 11>A community of men that want to look like real life dolls.</v>

1101
01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:12.320
What do you see when you look in the mirror?
Are very excited.

1102
01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:16.430
I just want to believe that that's a 70 year old man in the mirror.

1103
01:13:18.210 --> 01:13:19.700
<v 3>I do.
Yeah.</v>

1104
01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:24.230
Have you ever not made a child cry?

1105
01:13:26.010 --> 01:13:30.750
Is that,
that's the first thing I think about now with a one year old yeah.

1106
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:35.520
Is that he would see this and bust out crying immediately.

1107
01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:40.130
Therapy probably inconsolably crying.
It's so confusing.
It's even,

1108
01:13:40.150 --> 01:13:42.800
it's confusing for adults to look at it.
Yeah,
I'm confused.

1109
01:13:42.801 --> 01:13:46.580
I'm not sure what the Laura is here.
It takes you a second.
Then you're like,
oh,

1110
01:13:46.581 --> 01:13:48.260
I see what you did.
That's fucked up.

1111
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:57.700
I mean,
I'd rather see him just like I said with a why the mask.
Just try to be,

1112
01:13:57.810 --> 01:14:02.120
wow.
It's so upsetting.
Yeah,
and everybody's so upsetting.

1113
01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:07.480
I'd rather you be nonbinary started to wear these outfits and masks.

1114
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:10.760
Yeah.
Just tell me that you're a fucking androgynous.
That's fine.

1115
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:13.090
Let's over your Pronoun.
Yeah.
They know that.

1116
01:14:13.091 --> 01:14:16.800
Doesn't this make you miss the non-binary opening cloud or percent?
Yeah,

1117
01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:18.960
it makes me want to crawl under a stall and watch a guy.
Shit.

1118
01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:22.900
<v 2>That's what it makes me want to do.
Yeah.</v>

1119
01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:28.060
<v 3>Baseline coming out of the whole house.
The secrets of the living dolls.</v>

1120
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:31.900
Monday at 10 there's a whole series on it.
The best as her,

1121
01:14:33.230 --> 01:14:34.240
wait,
wait,
let me do it.

1122
01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:35.943
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

1123
01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:40.730
<v 3>Yeah.
No,
it's not a good look.
Look for natural</v>

1124
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:45.710
dog.
What'd we go get a full woman right there.

1125
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:50.790
Ah,
ah,
AH,

1126
01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:53.080
and dog.
Oh,

1127
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:58.930
that's terrifying.
And we play this at this time we didn't.

1128
01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:02.090
<v 11>Hey,
would you believe my boy,
I'm taking this shit.</v>

1129
01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:08.530
I'm taking a shit dog with you.

1130
01:15:11.570 --> 01:15:12.460
<v 3>This dude.</v>

1131
01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:17.830
This kid crawls under a stall bathroom,

1132
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:23.070
but I'm thinking that that look in his eye is a revealing.

1133
01:15:23.741 --> 01:15:28.570
He's touched.
I think so.
Either he's touched or he's on drugs.
Like he's,

1134
01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.210
he's tweaking on something and he doesn't know what the fuck he's doing.

1135
01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:35.530
You'd never crawl under us all in the men's room.
No Man,
that's,

1136
01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:39.500
I mean,
looking at them.
Oh,
no sorrows.

1137
01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:43.590
I actually can't believe how much this kid kept it together and laugh.

1138
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:47.110
That's taken a shit.
I would,
I don't know if I'll be able to laugh with someone.

1139
01:15:47.111 --> 01:15:49.420
I'd be like,
dude,
I'm shitting.
I got to tell you,
Bro,
I'm shitting.

1140
01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:54.630
I think 98% of the population would not be able to view it this way.

1141
01:15:54.851 --> 01:15:57.880
I know I wouldn't.
I wouldn't either unless I knew this kid like,
well,

1142
01:15:57.881 --> 01:16:01.520
let's say that's the kid that's known for being a little special attached and

1143
01:16:01.521 --> 01:16:04.660
like here comes Ron.
Ron and visually recognizes them.
Nothing work.

1144
01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:05.890
They're not friends.
Right,

1145
01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:08.590
but he sees the kid in school because this is probably his school.
Right?
It's,

1146
01:16:08.591 --> 01:16:12.410
I'm assuming.
Yeah,
title one school.
But you do it.
Oh to,

1147
01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:16.870
I like how he says it.
Yeah.
I'm taking his shit,
homie.
Yeah.

1148
01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:19.860
<v 11>Hey,
what'd you believe your my boy,
I'm thinking this shit.</v>

1149
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:26.280
Boy.
I'm taking this shit dog with you.

1150
01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:29.110
<v 3>It's kind of scary because at the end,</v>

1151
01:16:29.890 --> 01:16:33.550
the guy that crawled under the stall is really close to the camera.
Yeah.

1152
01:16:33.670 --> 01:16:36.940
He didn't walk that way.
He didn't walk towards the door.

1153
01:16:36.941 --> 01:16:41.560
He walked towards the right shooting and then it abruptly stops.
So yeah,

1154
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:44.410
there's so much to the story.
We don't know so much.

1155
01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:48.400
If you could just write in and let us know if you're the guy taking a shit.
Well,

1156
01:16:48.401 --> 01:16:51.280
if we need to know what happens before and after the shit.
God.

1157
01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:56.440
I like how he laughed.
So homey.
Oh
Shit.

1158
01:16:56.980 --> 01:17:01.600
Yeah.
This second to shit.
Can you see the shit?
I never know.

1159
01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:05.480
<v 2>No.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.</v>

1160
01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:09.620
<v 3>See,
he looks either touched or high.
I think he's touched</v>

1161
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:14.300
<v 4>and then no one has ever taken a shit.</v>

1162
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:17.960
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
definitely.

1163
01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:22.100
I'm taking a shit.

1164
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:28.160
And you know what I like too is the phrase homeboy like,

1165
01:17:28.161 --> 01:17:32.630
that's such an old school.
Hey homeboy.
Yeah.
You know,
it's just funny.
Yeah.

1166
01:17:32.631 --> 01:17:36.810
That's a good choice of words.
That's great.
Hi homeboy.
Yeah.
What you doing?

1167
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:42.200
I'm taking a shit.
So,
right.
What are you doing?
Oh,

1168
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:46.070
wow.
What's happening in the world?
What would you do if someone did that?

1169
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:50.480
I'd be all,
I'd be so alarmed.
I would not be able to laugh.
I'd be like,
excuse me.

1170
01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:55.220
Um,
um,
I'm taking a shit.
Yeah.
Hello?
Like I would be frantic.

1171
01:17:55.221 --> 01:17:59.420
What don't you,
so I would be,
I think I'd be super,
like,
I'd be super aggressive.

1172
01:17:59.450 --> 01:18:04.320
Yeah.
Get the fuck out of here.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
The fuck hey man.

1173
01:18:04.321 --> 01:18:07.670
What the fuck are you doing?
Yeah,
I would too.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Yeah.
I'd be like,

1174
01:18:07.671 --> 01:18:11.840
Whoa,
Whoa,
dude.
Yeah.
Hey,
the fuck are you doing?
I'm taking a shit.
Yeah.

1175
01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:16.310
Fucking Weirdo.
And I'd probably pinch it off and pull up my pants.
Yeah.
Probably.

1176
01:18:16.311 --> 01:18:19.910
You just have that mushy shit that's made your budget.
I think I would too,
man.

1177
01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:24.830
Right?
Yeah.
Because you're so vulnerable.
So vulnerable.
You're taking,

1178
01:18:24.831 --> 01:18:28.220
you're relaxed.
Yeah.
You should be.
Anyways.
Shit coming out of you.

1179
01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:34.520
Somebody enters that space,
a stranger crawls under the stall.
It's terrifying.

1180
01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:38.720
It very boundary stepping.
Very upsetting.
Yeah.

1181
01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:42.500
I wouldn't like that at all.
No,
I don't like that.
Gosh.
That either.

1182
01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:48.050
Yeah.
We have retired around this and you know,
especially when you're in a stall,

1183
01:18:48.051 --> 01:18:51.110
you think you're safe.
That's why you lost,
you know,
of course.
Okay.

1184
01:18:51.130 --> 01:18:53.210
Here's Kissy number one.
Can I see genes,
right?

1185
01:18:53.211 --> 01:18:57.740
Their pencils like yes.
Dogs.
However,

1186
01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:03.610
um,
hi.
Schnitz I saw this.
Uh,

1187
01:19:03.650 --> 01:19:07.790
Play that taking a shit homie.
Cause they're going to shit a boy.

1188
01:19:07.950 --> 01:19:11.840
Well you get puppies.
Why did we have a song submitted?
I should,

1189
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:13.910
I feel like I should play it on the way out.
Oh,
cool.
Okay.

1190
01:19:14.690 --> 01:19:17.740
Young Patrion is called how eyeglass,

Nice.

1192
01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:25.430
I'm just glad.
Oh,
we should have done this right.
We didn't do this real quick.

1193
01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:27.910
What's up with this?
Well Saul,
blah,

1194
01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:34.790
I'm in Las Vegas this week.
How's the blues?

1195
01:19:35.450 --> 01:19:40.190
Thursday,
the 9th of February.
Uh,

1196
01:19:40.191 --> 01:19:44.570
the full charge is coming with me.
Haven't done Las Vegas in the long.

1197
01:19:48.210 --> 01:19:50.940
<v 12>Oh,
it sounds made the beat,
but I have the wrong song.
Oh,

sorry.</v>

1198
01:19:50.941 --> 01:19:55.640
That's a different thing.
This is a sounds.
Made the beat instrumental.
Anyways,

1199
01:19:56.230 --> 01:20:00.730

Genes.
Okay,

1202
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:15.470
I know details about shows that are 100% going to be gone.

1203
01:20:18.930 --> 01:20:20.790
Um,

Edmonton had 30 tickets left this morning.

1209
01:20:41.730 --> 01:20:46.170
Vancouver has some singles,
so those are essentially sold out.
Bethlehem,

1210
01:20:46.171 --> 01:20:49.620

1211
01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:51.393

There won't be an adequate,

1218
01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:23.370
Chicago,

Royal Oak first has gone second,

That's also in March.

1220
01:21:27.301 --> 01:21:31.650
I'm not going to add a fourth.
So if you want to go,

The seventh has about a hundred left to go.

1223
01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:43.990
I'm debating whether to add one to that split debating,
put them in,

1224
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:47.940
put it in there and Pittsburgh.

It's in April.
So I wanted to add,

1229
01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:10.860
but um,
the next day is Easter.

1230
01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:16.320
So I thought maybe I would come back in like a month and do an added shows end.

1231
01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:20.700
So that's what I'm thinking of doing.
Um,
Seattle,

1232
01:22:21.330 --> 01:22:23.280
you really should get a ticket if you want to go.

1233
01:22:23.281 --> 01:22:28.140
That one's going to be about a hundred tickets left and it's,
um,

1234
01:22:28.770 --> 01:22:32.940
and then of course we're doing the live podcasts this Sunday.
Very excited.

1235
01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:38.040
February 12th at the Irvine Improv,
the first show sold out.

1236
01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:41.730
So we added a second show at nine live podcasts.

1237
01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:47.250
We have Yoshi,
the great Yoshi Obayashi is joining us.
That is,
um,

1238
01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:48.900
it's going to be a totally different show.

1239
01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:52.760
So we're really excited about that one's close to being sold out to him.
Yeah.

1240
01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:57.860
How many tickets?
Uh,

Yeah.
So I mean again,

1241
01:22:57.900 --> 01:23:00.660
pieces of things all have limited tickets left to them and I just figured I

1242
01:23:00.661 --> 01:23:03.570

jeans,

1243
