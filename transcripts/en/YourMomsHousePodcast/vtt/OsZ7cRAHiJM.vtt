7
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.850
that same franchise soon as you know what I'm saying?

8
00:00:48.851 --> 00:00:50.940
Like it's a mirror of know what I'm saying?

9
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.453
You know what I'm saying?

10
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.313
<v 2>Please me.</v>

11
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.470

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.760

The ghost crew.
Oh yeah.
Ghost crew.</v>

18
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.330
Those guys were one of the original song makers.
Yeah,

19
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.980
one of the very few favorites.

20
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.560
I think that's my favorite song that they made for us.
That one.
Yeah.

21
00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:47.070
It goes crew has so many great jams.
Incredible.
That was your mind?
Yes.

22
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.900
Those are my jams.
I a Midwest mine.
Oh,
I was in my genes.

23
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.680
I have officially crossed over into Midwestern mom.

24
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.970
I wore my house slippers out twice this weekend with Lj.
Yeah.

25
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.680
I was alone with them so I don't sleep in,
you know,
our kid doesn't nap level.

26
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.870
Wow.
The hounds are really going chasing and I totally,
I had on my fanny pack,

27
00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:10.970
thankfully.
Yeah.
But

28
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.920
she knits all the tagging.
But I did not have,
I forgotten my house.

29
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.290
Smell what?
You're not smell like a different times of the day.

30
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.170
Making sure that thing is on.
Oh,
you gotta make sure you check to verify.
No,

31
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.480
bring,
bringing back.
That song really made me appreciate Dennis Rodman's.

32
00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:32.420
You know what I'm saying?
Oh yeah.
Wait,
Dennis.
Robin didn't,

33
00:02:32.421 --> 00:02:36.580
do you know what I'm saying?
No,
no.
He's on there.
He my while while Blah Blah,

34
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.900
but that's not,
you know what I'm saying?
This blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Right.

35
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.720
You can't call that it.
You know what I'm saying?
That's a Rodman.
Yeah.

36
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.180
It made me miss him and his insanity and I wish a lot losses.
Yeah.

37
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.220
What's up with him though?
You know what I'm saying?
Why,
why,
why,

38
00:02:54.221 --> 00:02:59.221
why is this that guy that was the best documentary when he went to Korea.

39
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.020
<v 4>Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?
No,
not,
you know what I'm saying?</v>

40
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.460
You know what I'm saying?

41
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.940
I would load it.
Yeah.
Uh,
and he,

42
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:17.020
he's meeting with the dignitaries or whatever heads of state in North Korea and

43
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:20.750
he's just ripped.
He's completely shit faced.
Yeah.

44
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.310
And he's singing grammar carry.
They're singing to him and he's laughing.

45
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:29.110
And that song also brings back the memory of a Orson Welles drunk.
Yeah.

46
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.970
<v 5>Champagne.</v>

47
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.010
<v 4>Excellent.
Oh,</v>

48
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.380
that's one of my favorite things ever discovered.
That's the,

49
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.430
the best thing that the Internet did was,

50
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.280
was bring things like that to people's attention.
Yes.

51
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.380
Because before the Internet,

52
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:55.381
that thing just lived on a VHS and like five sound guys knew about that.

53
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.980
Yeah.
With the Internet,

54
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.420
all of us get to find out that he was out of his mind fucked up doing

55
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:04.980
commercials for a wine,
a wine maker and Pramod

56
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.020
and at that,
at that place in your career where you're having to do wine ads,

57
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.680
yeah.
You should probably show up sober and respect.
So yeah,

58
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.910
he's gone and he's still like,
I'm Orson Welles.
Yeah.

59
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.660
Know he's still running on that credit.
Like when the,
I still remember that.

60
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:26.890
He goes,
I haven't seen that in the years.
And he goes,
yes,
they got like accident.

61
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:28.570
He's like,
he doesn't do anything.

62
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.350
And they're like,
cut.
Good.
He's like,
you're wasting booth.
He doesn't do anything.

63
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.490
This is waiting on the other guy doesn't have a line yet

64
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.920
because he's supposed to be going like,
ah,
the French champagne.

65
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.660
And on that same French excellence,
so shit faced

66
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.510
<v 5>man.
Ah,
the French champagne has always been celebrated.</v>

67
00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.570
Its excellence there.
Is it kind of fun?

68
00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:03.060
You're shampooing by far my song

69
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.680
inspired by that same French excellence is fermented in the bottle and life.

70
00:05:10.231 --> 00:05:12.480
The Best French champagne.
It's

71
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.630
<v 4>breath loop.
And he's so fat at this point.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's real out of breath.</v>

72
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.640
Yeah.
Yeah.
God dammit.

73
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.730
<v 5>Ah,
champagne.</v>

74
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.640
There's always been celebrated.
Trust excellence.
There is a California

75
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:32.970
<v 6>Ah,
yeah,</v>

76
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.350
<v 4>the,
the forest.
Ah,
yes.
Yup.</v>

77
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.000
They had to know,
oh yeah.
You know,
third tag.
They're like,

78
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.080
this is not going to happen,

79
00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:47.010
but I bet they knew the moment he stepped on set and they were like,
Shit.
Yeah.

80
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.550
But he's so legendary.
You,
I think part of you,
even if he shows up,
I get it.

81
00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:54.510
You're like,
this guy's,
oh,
he'll,
it isn't magic for a reason.
Yeah.

82
00:05:54.511 --> 00:05:56.850
He's going to turn it on.
Right.
Like when the camera's rolling.

83
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.070
And sometimes they don't.

84
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.730
<v 7>Sometimes they're like,
well,
uh,</v>

85
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.380
the have always been excellent.
He said all his,

86
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.200
his pitch just all over.
It's all over a man.
Yeah.

87
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.970
And that Rodman thing is incredible.
I miss him.
I,
you know what?

88
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:17.810
There should just be a 24,
seven documentary crew following that guy.

89
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.170
Cause I feel like he's,
he's always doing something ridiculous.

90
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.240
You should know about it.
I agree.

91
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.670
Want to do I want to do a proper show up and then the alien guy.
Yeah.
Yeah.

92
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.680
You're going to love this.
Yes.
It's so fucking amazing to me.

93
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.600
Why is my chair so low?
I don't know.
I laughed so hard at this.

94
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.550
Ah,

95
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.010
<v 8>oh,
I love it.
So there they certainly don't,</v>

96
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.800
but the point is that China is the one that can come.

97
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.430
The only one that can control Kim Jong,

98
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.050
this crazy fact kid that's running a North Korea

99
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.023
was Randy.

100
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.790
<v 0>Well,
go to your mom's house,</v>

101
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.853
Christina.

102
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.103
Okay.

103
00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.830
I have not laugh this

104
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:51.420
<v 7>hard in a long time.
I saw this on my flight to DC.
Oh Nice.</v>

105
00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:56.520
So I was,
I had,
you know,
Wifi and I'm just,
and I see this thing and I'm like,

106
00:07:56.521 --> 00:07:59.700
wait,
what?
And this is Senator John Mccain,

107
00:07:59.701 --> 00:08:02.910
former presidential candidate on,

108
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:07.590
I think it's Greta van Susteren.
And obviously,
you know,

109
00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:11.310
this topic comes up and he very matter of factly,

110
00:08:11.311 --> 00:08:16.311
it stands out so much because people in this position usually maintain a level

111
00:08:17.131 --> 00:08:19.440
of diplomacy no matter who they're talking about.

112
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:25.260
Our president's kind of a kick the door down on that.
Yeah,
I guess.
But it's also,

113
00:08:25.261 --> 00:08:26.940
I thought,
look,
I think that part of this,

114
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:31.030
my theory on this is when you're a pow yeah.
Um,

115
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:35.720
for a number of years,
you brutally beaten and tortured.
Yeah.
So you,

116
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.540
you have a kind of a matter of fact way of speaking some shit.

117
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:45.140
And um,
let's be honest,
he was,
he was,
uh,
uh,

118
00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.610
tortured by the Vietnamese.

119
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.640
So I think his whole outlook on the Asian world is skewed a little different

120
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.040
than most people.
Yeah.
So it's

121
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:01.040
<v 4>just to me to hear a guy just like lay right into,</v>

122
00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:06.000
I mean,
even though he's obviously is a,
he is a dictator as a maniac,

123
00:09:06.001 --> 00:09:10.170
but he's just like,
it's crazy to say this crazy fat kid running great Korea.

124
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.700
I was shaking on this plant.
I mean I was laughing so fucking hard.
Yeah.

125
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.140
With my headphones in and just like,
oh yeah.
And then the best part,

126
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:24.141
but we don't even have it here is that he continued after this and she continued

127
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:29.370
with no,
like there was no pause,
you know?
It was just like,

128
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:30.530
just like staying here.

129
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:35.040
You know what I really regret with Mccain is that when he was running for

130
00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:39.510
president,
yeah.
I thought he was the whack out the wacky candidate.

131
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.180
You know what I mean?
Like now I look at him and I'm like,
ah,
oh,
right.

132
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:45.240
It was president.
That guy's great.
I really like him more now.

133
00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:49.650
Maybe I was too young to appreciate him,
but now you're like,
that guy is Kinda,

134
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.170
he's got his head on,
right?
Yeah.
I like him.

135
00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:53.890
I like the shit that he's saying now for sure.
Well,

136
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:58.590
I like guys that weren't captured,
but anyways,
guys at weren't captured.
Yeah.

137
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:01.620
Right,
right.
That's right.

138
00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:04.490
I've heard that that's some kind of a failure on his part.
Right?
Yeah.

139
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.760
It shouldn't have been captured.
Right.
Eh,

140
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.960
<v 8>an air defense missile is there.
They certainly don't.</v>

141
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:14.210
But the point is that China is the one that can con the only one that can

142
00:10:14.211 --> 00:10:17.690
control Kim Jong.
There's crazy fact kid.

143
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.940
They're trialing a North Korea

144
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:22.510
<v 4>magic.
That's the most magical moment.</v>

145
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:25.410
That's how I'll remember him for the rest of my life.
Yeah.
Yeah.

146
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:30.650
He's writing because the thing is,
no second,
nobody is going to defend Kim Jong.

147
00:10:30.651 --> 00:10:32.360
Oh,
no one's going to know of course,
gives me,

148
00:10:32.361 --> 00:10:37.040
are you fat shaming the supreme leader?
But amongst like politicians,

149
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.930
there's usually like decorum.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And then they have this,
uh,
you know,

150
00:10:41.931 --> 00:10:45.180
they had this,
I forget what they call it with North Korea.
Uh,

151
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:49.370
patient diplomacy is the tactic,
but he's just like,

152
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:50.460
fuck that phrase,

153
00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:56.180
which sometimes you do have to be like,
fuck that crazy factor.
Yeah.
I mean,

154
00:10:56.181 --> 00:11:01.100
you know,
I mean,
he is a fucking worldclass asshole that guy.
So I I,
you know,

155
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.800
I mean it's not like you gotta be nice about them,
but no,

156
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.660
<v 8>there's crazy fat kid</v>

157
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.090
<v 4>11,
you're fat shaming.
Oh yeah.
You're a fat shame.</v>

158
00:11:10.091 --> 00:11:13.900
I'm sure there was some of that.
Well,
do you think anybody's defending?
Yeah,

159
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:18.760

What are you doing?
Oh gene,

160
00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:23.170
It's nice.
What are you doing?
You're ruining.
The dogs are going crazy.

161
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.160
Look fiefs on top of Schnitzel.
Yeah.

162
00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:30.820
Faith has given him the business of the business.
I messed up her pronoun.

163
00:11:30.821 --> 00:11:33.280
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
I'm so sorry Betsy.

164
00:11:33.281 --> 00:11:36.670

169
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:56.260
every time you say Pat House,

170
00:11:56.261 --> 00:11:59.900
I picture like a really obese person and I know he got wet.

171
00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:04.210
There's a guy named Pat House that I was on the biggest loser.
Oh.

172
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.670
Like I've really fat guy.
That's why I'm,

173
00:12:06.671 --> 00:12:10.090
maybe I've seen it as well because he talks about it on stage because of that.

174
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:14.260
I house hit up this Pat House.
Yeah,

Yeah.

175
00:12:14.261 --> 00:12:18.910
One time he was like,

176
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.320

Basically.
You're skinny.

177
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.860
Yeah.
Well I think he lost the,
this one,
the,
the biggest loser one.

178
00:12:26.861 --> 00:12:29.010
Lost a lot of weight he might've wanted or something.
Wow.

179
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:32.050
And then Pat House that I know,
you know,

180
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.870
just tells a story about meeting the guy.
Oh,
that's so random.

181
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.720
Or interacting with them.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.
But this pat,

182
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.270
Pat's like fucking 170 pounds.
Normal.
Weighted.
Totally normal.

183
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.410
Totally normal weight.
Um,
we went to the,
uh,

184
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.490
national portrait gallery.
Those are fun.
There's one in England I've been to.

185
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.710
Yeah,
it one's American.
It's fucking,

186
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.310
it's only English there and it's fucking better.
Who did you say Roy?
Stronger.

187
00:12:59.311 --> 00:13:02.920
They're stronger,
number one.
Do you know what was alarming?

188
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:07.660
So you,
you,
you know,
the,
the hit makers of us presidents,
they were like,
Oh,

189
00:13:07.661 --> 00:13:11.410
you know,
obviously true Roosevelt,
you start seeing,
you're like,
yeah,
yeah,

190
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.700
you get to this period.
Unless you were a real history buff.

191
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.010
He started walking by portraits where you're like,

192
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.910
never even heard of that guy's name before and it's a prep.

193
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:25.670
Let me pull this up for as a president.
Yes.
I know a lot of,

194
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.530
okay,
I've learned my histories.
I think you're going to be blown away by

195
00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.810
presidents of the United States today.

196
00:13:34.811 --> 00:13:39.380
Have portraits of real celebrities like king asked ripper.
Um,

197
00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:44.140
how about this one?
Okay,
first of all,
does not have one.

198
00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:48.720
Um,
I left a little note there.
I said,
what about the mommies?
Well,

199
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:53.590
I was going to say that,
that you and I are a list celebrities.

200
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:58.710
I mean our Internet radio show gets downloaded way more than a lot of TV shows

201
00:13:59.531 --> 00:14:03.310
get watched low to it's seems pretty obvious.

202
00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:08.700
I got startled while you still,
you're supposed to be from this side.

203
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:14.510
That was terrifying word.
Where are we?
Oh,

204
00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:18.970
so scary.
That's coach ice.
Yeah.
Oh,
that's actually not Cochise another coach,

205
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.990
but other screaming coaches do we have on,
there's a few.
There's a few.

206
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:26.680
This is a different coach all together right here.
That's a different coach.

207
00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:31.150
Who's that?
That is Horse Morris.
Horace.
More.
That's his name.

208
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:32.350
I remember her name.
Yeah.

209
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.600
I'm not showing you portrait.
I'm going to give you names.
Coolidge.
Okay,
go ahead.

210
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.860
So bunch of all stars begin heavy hitters.

211
00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:47.470
Heavy hitters start.
Oh No,
not a precedent.

212
00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:52.550
So you know,
so George obviously a big dub,

213
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:56.750
right?
John Adams.
Jefferson Madison.
You're like,
oh yeah,
yeah,

No.

214
00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:01.410
That number eight.
Martin van Buren.
Martin van Buren.
Never heard him.

215
00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:05.810
Family actually went to college with a descendant of the van Buren.

216
00:15:05.811 --> 00:15:10.550
Never heard of him.
Okay.
Uh,
after him knew that William Harrison,

217
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:15.290
no clue.
Never heard of any US president?
No.
Just for a second after him.

218
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:20.210
John Tyler.
Tyler,
he's in Duran Duran.
No.
You got that one.

219
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.840
Um,
yeah.
Poke after that.
How about this one?
After that?

220
00:15:23.841 --> 00:15:27.410
This was my most alarming one.

221
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:32.540
President Zachary Taylor and old.
Rough and ready.

222
00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:36.800
That was his nickname.
Never residents.
Zack,
wait,
how come?

223
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.820
Cause then we have to learn these in school.
Like you have to memorize them.

224
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.610
Never heard of this guide.
I don't remember Zachary.

225
00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.700
I mean he was obviously not there for long.
Okay.

226
00:15:46.701 --> 00:15:51.650
But still no one ever mentioned President Zach mentioned old rough and ready.
Oh,

227
00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:55.010
rough and ready?
Yeah.
Can I have your coffee?

228
00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:59.970
Drinking the cold one with the straw.
It doesn't up my whitening.
Okay.

229
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.600
This is fun.
Okay.
I thought I knew.
Right.
But that's what I'm saying.
Do you know,

230
00:16:05.601 --> 00:16:07.840
obviously,
I mean there's not that many.
So you,

231
00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.920
most of the names click something and you,

232
00:16:09.921 --> 00:16:12.700
even the ones that you weren't really studied up on.
Yeah,

233
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.790
but when we saw Zachary Taylor,
Rosa parks,
is she on there?
Yeah,

234
00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.870
she was 33rd president

235
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.180
history buff.
Oh,
I love it.
I love history.
I'm just,

236
00:16:25.181 --> 00:16:30.080
what about Franklin Pierce?
Yes.
You knew him.
Yeah,
I remember the name.

237
00:16:30.081 --> 00:16:33.120
I don't know.
I can't tell you what the guy did.
James Buchanan.
Yes.

238
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.500
I knew be Canon history.
11th grade.
Come on,

239
00:16:36.501 --> 00:16:41.300
Mister [inaudible] high school for that name.
They were him.
Lincoln.
No,
no,
no.

240
00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:46.130
Doesn't ring a bell.
Another guy,
Benjamin Franklin wasn't a precedent.

241
00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:50.000
You sure about that?
Yeah,
but then I did a lot of other stuff.
You sure?

242
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:54.470
Electricity,
poor James ALMANAC wasn't a president chain.

243
00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:00.800
Uh,
what else did he invent?
Let's see.
Pup play.

244
00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:04.130
That was also invented by Benjamin Franklin,
right?
Chester.
Arthur.
No,

245
00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:07.950
never heard of that guy.
Chester.
Yeah,
it's anybody named Chester anymore.

246
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.290
The fucking president.
His asshole.
I like that.
The gentleman boss.

247
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:16.070
Elegant Arthur gentlemen boss.
But I mean that's going to come back.

248
00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:18.440
That named Chester is going to be a hipster name.
Mark my words,

249
00:17:18.441 --> 00:17:20.540
he was a president,
you know,

250
00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:24.710
in the late 18 hundreds that's one that he should have known.
Yeah,

251
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:29.110
I was in middle school.
He was fucking was your family in this country?

252
00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:33.650
It was the presidential salary.
Then $50,000 a year.

253
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.250
That's fucking crazy.
Wait,
that can't be right.

254
00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:41.300
It doesn't seem like that's like $1 million a year.
That's not,

255
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.070
that's not accurate.
Because what do they make now?

256
00:17:43.071 --> 00:17:45.380
A hundred thousand a year and make 400 grand now.

257
00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:49.770
Ha being the president.

258
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.620
A lot of money,
Huh?
Fuck,

259
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.660
you got to be president to make money like that.

260
00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:04.890
Would you ever want to date your president?
I mean,
you know,

261
00:18:04.891 --> 00:18:06.320
once you get into a certain era,

262
00:18:06.321 --> 00:18:09.000
they all are familiar because they're more recent.
But go ahead.

263
00:18:09.001 --> 00:18:12.930
Let's do some more.
This is super fun.
I like to know how stupid I am.

264
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.810
It feels good,
right?
You said you didn't,

265
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:21.090
did you know Rutherford Hayes with for Hayes?
It's in a song.

266
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:26.310
It's a song or something.
Might suddenly reason I know it.
I know the words.

267
00:18:26.311 --> 00:18:29.970
I don't know what he did.
I don't know.
James Garfield.
Garfield.

268
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.970
Did I favorite cartoon character?
Yeah,
go ahead.
Okay.
Um,

269
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:38.310
Chester,
we went through that.
What about Benjamin Harrison?

270
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.903
<v 9>Dude,</v>

271
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:46.050
<v 4>no clue.
Benjamin Harrison Arms President Harrison,</v>

272
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:50.040
23rd president,
nickname,
kid gloves.
Harrison or little Ben.

273
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.980
What are the nicknames now for the president's,
what was Obama's,

274
00:18:52.981 --> 00:18:56.070
does it say Barry?
So Barry and Barry,

275
00:18:57.550 --> 00:18:58.890
uh,
um,

276
00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:03.930
that'd be hilarious if that was a wish someone could hack that site and put it

277
00:19:03.931 --> 00:19:06.580
there.
Bear.
Yeah.
Um,

278
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:11.220
I mean after that I think you've heard of everybody.
Are you sure?
I'm pretty bad.

279
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:16.050
It's all on you being honest about whether you wrote,
okay,

280
00:19:16.051 --> 00:19:18.990
so Benjamin Harrison,
you hadn't heard of it?
No clue.

281
00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:22.230
Grover Cleveland High School.
William Mckinley.

282
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.360
<v 9>No,
there you go</v>

283
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:30.470
<v 4>dude.
He's president now into the 19 hundreds.
The idol,</v>

284
00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:35.100
the idol of Oh,
Ohio,
Ohio.
How much did he get paid?

285
00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.313
50,000.

286
00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.620
The last jump was 200 grand.
I think

287
00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:48.410
it was 200 grand for a while.
He was in Methodist to Jane,
not America.

288
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:53.960
Okay.
I think I want a second.
I think you've heard of the rest,

289
00:19:53.961 --> 00:19:55.790
but let's double check Mckinley.

290
00:19:55.791 --> 00:19:59.300
You hadn't obviously Roosevelt and a,
yeah,

291
00:19:59.301 --> 00:20:02.590
because I know a couple of Mckinley high schools.
Gotcha.
Uh,

292
00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.980
Rosie cause he was a wheelchair.
Uh,

293
00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:12.020
polio as a child.
I believe.
William Taft.
There's Taft high school.
Yeah,
I know.

294
00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:17.330
A Woodrow Wilson.
Wilson high school.
Yes.

295
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:20.600
Yes.
I've heard.
How about this one?
Yeah,
go ahead.
Be Honest.

296
00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.460
Beyond saying Warren Harding.

297
00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.060
<v 9>No,
dude,
no,</v>

298
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.260
<v 4>we walked by,
we've walked by this portrait.
I was like,</v>

299
00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:32.130
who's this guy is just like an old senator or something?
Nope.
29th.

300
00:20:32.131 --> 00:20:35.100
President of United States doesn't ring a bell.
Get what's his middle name?

301
00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:39.540
Jameel.
Yeah.
William Jamal Harding name none listed.

302
00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:46.120
Right.
Morin.
Jamil Harding.
Look at this man in the 1920s.
Yeah,

303
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.090
the presence salar 75 grand a year.
Isn't that,

304
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.600
that's the bandannas because that's,
that is millions of dollars now.

305
00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:57.580
But look at his term.
1921 to 23.
Oh,
he died?
Yeah.

306
00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:01.570
Oh.
So that's why Calvin Coolidge became proud.
We know.
Cool.

307
00:21:01.571 --> 00:21:05.800
And I know Calvin Coolidge.
Yeah.
They used to call him old.
Cool cow.
Cool.

308
00:21:05.801 --> 00:21:08.770
Nutz yeah.
Yep.
Old Slick Dick.
Cool.

309
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.640
Calvin like to smell his own funds.

310
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.540
That's why they called him that silent cow.

311
00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:21.220
He called them because Bart stinkers,
that's his nickname.

312
00:21:21.221 --> 00:21:26.050
Silent cows.
He says,
yes.
That's such a liar.

313
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.540
Look what it says right here.
Let me see.

314
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:34.200
Silent cow farts were silent but deadly as far as the whole thing.

315
00:21:34.301 --> 00:21:36.850
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

316
00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:42.340
Silent but deadly cow.
Um,
corporate Hoover.
Yes,

317
00:21:42.341 --> 00:21:45.280
of course.
Hoover.
Yeah.
Do you know about,

318
00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:50.350
know about,
uh,
you know about,

319
00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:55.510
uh,
I remember.
So little of history.
Do you,

320
00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:59.890
can you remember anything you learned in high school?
No,
not a fucking thing.

321
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.500
Very little things.
If I retained,

322
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.430
you said very few things you said Theodore.

323
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:09.270
Theodore Roosevelt was in the chair,
wasn't it?

324
00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:14.080
Roosevelt was in a wheelchair,
but not Theodore,
not teddy.

325
00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:17.860
Teddy was about Franklin.
Delanor Roosevelt was in the wheelchair.

326
00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.270
Delano Delanore um,
you heard Truman?
I probably that guy.

327
00:22:22.271 --> 00:22:25.060
Truman compony writer for the rest of these.
Let's see.

328
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:30.020
Let's see what Barry's nickname was.
None.
No bullshit man.

329
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.930
The black guy doesn't get a nickname that shitty.

330
00:22:31.931 --> 00:22:34.810
Is that the injustice of it all?

331
00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:39.250
But some guys on the south side of Chicago could fill in that gap.
Come by.
Bear.

332
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:44.750
Gene's old mom jeans,
mom jeans.
That's the name.

333
00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.170
That's how that stuff came around.
I think because he was making,

334
00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.190
they're making fun of his light denim.
Yeah.

335
00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:55.640
So let's see this real quick.
I want to see when the,
it changed here.
Yeah.

336
00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.710
So 200 grand a year.
Was it?

337
00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:02.740
It was through,
um,

338
00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:07.930
Clinton and then jumped to 400 rounds with double Clinton was the last of the

339
00:23:07.931 --> 00:23:11.660
200 grand.
200 large.
Wow.

340
00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:16.420
That but 50 grand in what the turn of the century sounds like a fortune,

341
00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:20.650
but it has to be so much money.
That's not,

342
00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.890
that can't be accurate.
Maybe it was,
but it made the,

343
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:25.780
made you really rich at that point.

344
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:31.070
I don't want these guys now get a $50,000 expense account as well on top of

345
00:23:32.531 --> 00:23:36.610
their 400 grand.
Okay.
If you could time travel,
we have to go back in time.

346
00:23:36.611 --> 00:23:40.330
You can't go forward.
Where would you go?
What era of American?

347
00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.900
If I had to go anywhere in American history,
let's start there.

348
00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:45.950
That's a good question,
man.

349
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:48.410
<v 7>I mean,</v>

350
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:51.680
wouldn't you want to just kind of drop into every era for a moment to see what

351
00:23:51.681 --> 00:23:53.590
it's like?
It's hard to pick one.

352
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:57.810
<v 1>Uh,
no.
Fuck.
The caveman stuff.
Like I don't want to tell that about us.</v>

353
00:23:57.811 --> 00:24:02.250
Those dopes the last few hundred years.
Yeah,
I guess.
No.
Can I tell you what?

354
00:24:02.251 --> 00:24:05.760
I don't,
I'm not interested.
Right.
I hate cowboy.

355
00:24:05.761 --> 00:24:09.900
Anything like with all the dust and dirt and the gun stuff.
So you'd like to,

356
00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:14.330
I don't want to go to the wild west into 1960 is that you're telling me?
Oh,

357
00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:15.560
I would love the 60s.
Okay.
Yeah.

358
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:19.460
Put me in like London in the 60s when Beatlemania that's what you want.

359
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.380
That will be fun.
I like fun.
We find writing to be a mod

360
00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:26.580
<v 7>to be all cool.
I'd like to take my current,
um,</v>

361
00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:31.850
like physique to the 1930s NFL where I would be considered probably bigger and

362
00:24:33.511 --> 00:24:37.040
faster than at least 80,
90% of them.
God.
Yeah.

363
00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:40.140
Or even the NBA like before they let black guys play.
Yeah.

364
00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:42.380
Would just be like a fucking run this shit dude.
Yeah.

365
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:45.420
I've seen how they traveled back then I'd show up and they'd be like,

366
00:24:45.421 --> 00:24:49.140
what the fuck?
Yeah.
I,
yeah,
I'm way of playing.

367
00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:53.850
<v 1>You know,
I would do,
I would go to like 19.
Yeah.
59,</v>

368
00:24:53.851 --> 00:24:58.290
58 in America.
Yeah.
And be like,
I'm a female stand up comic.
Oh,
kind of like what?

369
00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:00.720
I'm all,
watch this bitch and then fucking blow minds.

370
00:25:00.721 --> 00:25:03.000
And get arrested and stuff like Lenny Bruce.
That'd be awesome.

371
00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.150
Both hats on their heads.
That's what's up.

372
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:09.660
You have fucking seen these mushy purple's no,
like Ah,
obscenity.
It'd be great.

373
00:25:09.661 --> 00:25:11.890
Be so fun.
Mostly perps mm.

374
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.260
<v 7>Uh,</v>

375
00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:17.260
the news being like Christina Mushy perps he today was arrested outside of the

376
00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.080
purple on.
Yeah.

377
00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.850
<v 1>What's wrong with saying mushy purples?</v>

378
00:25:20.851 --> 00:25:23.960
I could say what I want is just the costing and they would cut the ring.

379
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.900
Like it is horrifying.
Yeah.
Love it.
Her purpose.

380
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:31.730
<v 7>Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't really like to do that and then be fine.
Um,
yeah,</v>

381
00:25:31.731 --> 00:25:35.090
so I did that.
I went to and I learned about presence I didn't know we had,

382
00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.050
and then I also went to the nat Geo Museum.
And do you know what,

383
00:25:39.051 --> 00:25:41.960
they have their pictures of soggy tits.

384
00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:46.370
They actually had a lack of that.
That's really,
that's all that should be it.

385
00:25:46.371 --> 00:25:51.110
The National Geographic basically have two exhibits,
like the first part,

386
00:25:51.111 --> 00:25:55.260
second part kind of thing.
It's,
it's pretty small,
but yeah.
You know,
whatever,
uh,

387
00:25:55.790 --> 00:26:00.140
the first section,
so half of the nat Geo Museum is there.

388
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:04.820
Their Instagram account blown up.
Oh,
it's stupid.
So you walk in and you're like,

389
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:08.030
this is your Instagram account.
And they're like,
yeah,

390
00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:12.040
<v 1>could have seen that on my phone right now I have to fly to Washington and just,</v>

391
00:26:12.041 --> 00:26:16.240
uh,
is blown up here.
And they're like,
yeah,
exactly.
That's Super Gay.
You know,

392
00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:19.240
Washington DC,
we went to that stupid CIA museum.

393
00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:22.030
We were all excited about spies and stuff.

394
00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:25.770
<v 7>Spy Museum is for fucking fifth graders,
but they don't.
Yeah,</v>

395
00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:29.080
<v 1>well it was terrible and not where I like spicy stuff of course.</v>

396
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:31.360
But it's like for children,
this light,
this one is too,
by the way,

397
00:26:31.361 --> 00:26:36.220
this is not for adults because in Berlin and in Hungary you can see like,

398
00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:37.570
you want to see some shit.

399
00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:40.210
You want to see the KGB museum where they tortured people.

400
00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:44.540
They have that in Budapest.
Do legit like spooky.
You,

401
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:49.530
you'll cry Lee,
you'll leave crying.
It's so real.
I don't want to see you man.

402
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.450
We don't have that in America.
We have it.
This won't show it today.

403
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:58.620
We need more tragedy.
More time,
more time.
Um,
now what's really upsetting,

404
00:26:58.621 --> 00:27:02.670
you told me a story today about your experience in first class.

405
00:27:02.671 --> 00:27:06.810
Let's talk about that because I,
it really bothered me to hear this happened.

406
00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:11.230
<v 7>This is so annoying.
Um,
and so,</v>

407
00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:15.580
um,
probably upsetting for someone to hear me complain about,

408
00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.500
but it's still as irritating as shit.

409
00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.480
<v 1>It's not Tom,
it's not,
you've earned first class.</v>

410
00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:22.800
<v 7>Well,
here's what happened and this happens all the time.</v>

411
00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:25.950
You get on for any of these,
especially for me,

412
00:27:25.951 --> 00:27:29.040
breakfast is really all I cared about.
This happens in coach too,
by the way.

413
00:27:29.041 --> 00:27:32.250
This is not just a first class.
No,
you're right.
But in,
in,
in first class,

414
00:27:32.251 --> 00:27:36.960
what they do is when you're on a flight that's over three hours to serve a meal.

415
00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:40.920
Complimentary of course,
yes.
And,
uh,
you know,
you get your booze,
whatever.

416
00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:45.240
I don't drink really on flaps are not at five in the morning.
No.
I mean,

417
00:27:45.241 --> 00:27:48.390
I know some people that do,
but yeah,
I don't.

418
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:52.200
So anyways,
uh,

419
00:27:52.201 --> 00:27:56.940
I get on and they're like,
um,
the lady hands up menus,

420
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.970
you basically have two options,
but they,
they printed out.
Right,
right.

421
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:02.550
Give you your menu and it says,
uh,

422
00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:06.480
this omelet with a chicken sausage and blah,
blah,
blah.
Right.

423
00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:11.370
Or oatmeal and fruit.
So you know what I'm going to have,

424
00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:14.030
<v 1>right.
You're going to go for the Quito friendly option.
Yeah,</v>

425
00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:18.380
<v 7>we're going to have it every time.
So I'm sitting there,
I'm in the last row.</v>

426
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:23.510
I'm in the aisle and I watched her in the last row.
Yes,
go ahead.
Go ahead.

427
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:25.490
Fourth row aisle seat.
Oh Gee.

428
00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:30.520
Now I watch her go from left to right across row one left to right row to left

429
00:28:32.521 --> 00:28:36.110
to right.
Row Three.
When she comes to my row,
the fourth row,

430
00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:41.630
she looks at me and the guy sitting next to me and then across the aisle.

431
00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:45.710
So in other words,
the last two that she'll hit two women,

432
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:48.260
she looks at the four of us and goes,

433
00:28:48.261 --> 00:28:53.261
we have a omelet and we have a oatmeal.

434
00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:58.040
And then I go,
so I'm about to say Amen.
She goes,
ah,

435
00:28:58.041 --> 00:29:00.700
ladies first turns.
Hmm.

436
00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.790
Like skips the whole way she had been doing it.
The two ladies go,

437
00:29:04.791 --> 00:29:07.970
we'll have omelets.
And then she turns to me and she goes,

438
00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:13.160
I guess you guys are having oatmeal.
And I go,
no,
I'm not.
She goes,
no.
And I go,

439
00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:17.600
no,
I don't want oatmeal.
Hmm.
Well,
she's like,
oh,
I go,

440
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:22.460
so is there not another omelet?
No.
And I go,
okay,
then I'll just,

441
00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:25.100
I'm good.
No,
it didn't make like a big stink about it.
I go,

442
00:29:25.101 --> 00:29:29.030
I'm good then you don't want,
and I go,
no,
I don't want it.

443
00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:34.190
And she's like,
um,
I'll see if I can find another one.

444
00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.100
Which is a weird thing to say,
where are you going to find it?
Yeah.
Don't,

445
00:29:37.101 --> 00:29:41.090
you know,
that's like you saying that there's none left for a reason.
Um,

446
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.120
so I just go,

447
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:47.380
I kinda zonk out for a minute and when I wake up she goes,
oh,

448
00:29:47.381 --> 00:29:50.710
I found something.
Oh,
you did go.
Okay.

449
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.670
And she puts in front of me like some scrambled eggs,

450
00:29:55.540 --> 00:30:00.040
which is weird because from where?
From coach,

451
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:04.030
I don't know where the fuck coach option,
I was like,
no,
they don't serve that.

452
00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:08.350
They don't serve that.
They might of like a wrap with the egg.
And coach.

453
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.970
I Dunno.
Uh,
I just,
uh,
I looked at it and I was like,

454
00:30:12.971 --> 00:30:17.971
this doesn't seem like what is on this plane as an option just seemed bizarre to

455
00:30:18.671 --> 00:30:23.170
me.
But it is always super annoying when they have,

456
00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:27.730
we have five of these and four of these have more.
Yeah.
And then you go,

457
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:30.550
I don't want that thing on.
They're like,
well,
you got the wrong seat.

458
00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:35.440
And then sometimes these,
uh,
flight attendants will pick their own path.

459
00:30:35.441 --> 00:30:37.480
Like that lady,
it's arbitrary.
Go like,
yeah,

460
00:30:37.481 --> 00:30:39.470
we're gonna start in the back row today.
All right,

461
00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:42.670
we're going to start over here.
Since she did the,
you know,
ladies,

462
00:30:42.671 --> 00:30:47.380
first thing I seriously,
in my mind wanting to go like,
excuse me,

463
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:51.070
you went like this the whole time,
right?
There's a lady there.

464
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:55.120
You didn't jump over to her.
Right?
So fuck these ladies.
What's up?

465
00:30:55.121 --> 00:30:59.800
What the reverse sexism,
Huh?
I mean,
at what?
We're not talking about a,

466
00:30:59.801 --> 00:31:02.410
they get to,
uh,
you know,
putting their bag in the overhead,

467
00:31:02.411 --> 00:31:05.830
which I'd gladly do for them.
Right.
Were talking about,
well,
why do,

468
00:31:05.831 --> 00:31:07.600
why do I get leapfrogged for that?
No.

469
00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:11.930
<v 1>Well,
there's a lot of flaws.
Here's what happens now when I'm in first class.</v>

470
00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:16.430
Yeah.
I always try to pick a seat in the first two rows for this exact reason.

471
00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:21.420
I swear to God,
I am so afraid of being passed over on the food options.
Yeah.

472
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:25.780
Even when I sat in economy,
I would always try to get premium economy.
Yeah.

473
00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:30.410
So that I can get the snack box of my choice because many times I want the

474
00:31:30.411 --> 00:31:34.010
cheese box and then by the time they get to me and I'm in road 25 they're like,

475
00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:38.330
oh,
we're out of the cheese bar.
I'm like,
well,
why don't you get more?

476
00:31:38.331 --> 00:31:40.190
If you know it's a popular item,

477
00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:45.740
why wouldn't you have more?
Get more cheese boxes?
Yes.

478
00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:46.880
Get more meals.

479
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:51.800
Build bigger overhead compartments.
Yes.

480
00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:56.510
For our bags that every fucking flight I get on they go.

481
00:31:56.690 --> 00:32:00.950
There's limited space.
I mean,
you got to check your bag.
We'll build a bigger,

482
00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:05.120
it doesn't this happen every flight now.
Why can't you build more space?

483
00:32:05.121 --> 00:32:09.140
Who's the genius that design this?
I have fucking two feet above my head.
Right.

484
00:32:09.141 --> 00:32:13.730
Make that shit bigger man or don't allow any.
Then make everybody check them in.

485
00:32:13.731 --> 00:32:17.330
Then there's no fucking problem.
It's so irritating.

486
00:32:17.331 --> 00:32:20.750
And then you see people carrying their entire lives on the airplane and it's

487
00:32:20.751 --> 00:32:22.040
five different pieces he

488
00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.750
<v 7>read.
Yeah.
Is the fuck.
It's always a guy.
Some douche bag guy.</v>

489
00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:27.070
We'll board a flight,

490
00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:32.680
puts his bag and one of the front compartments and then walk to the,

491
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:36.490
they do that when you do that.
I've done it.
Oh Man,
I fucking,

492
00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:40.100
I could feel my blood rise.
I do it

493
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:40.880
<v 4>only if,</v>

494
00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:45.050
only if I know that they're loading back to front and I'm like screwed and I'm

495
00:32:45.051 --> 00:32:49.640
not in a good zone boarding zone cause I know I'm going to get fucked on it so I

496
00:32:49.641 --> 00:32:53.120
won't put it in first class cause I know that's disrespectful but I will on my

497
00:32:53.121 --> 00:32:57.050
way back Boob,
drop that up and rode 10 my ass is in road 20 whatever.

498
00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:02.360
I guess one of my bags up here and also when I'm on d planning than I just boop

499
00:33:02.361 --> 00:33:06.200
grab it and I'm out.
You know
that's not cool.

500
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:08.460
That's not fair.
And it's always win.

501
00:33:08.461 --> 00:33:13.010
Like of course when like a flight attendants not looking because you want to be

502
00:33:13.011 --> 00:33:16.820
like,
excuse me,
excuse me,
excuse me,

503
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:22.070
this loser.
No,
no,

504
00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.780
I can't tolerate it.
Do you tattle?
No,
cattle

505
00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:32.060
don't snitch.
That's the thing is you're like on the vert you're like,
no,

506
00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.070
you can't snitch and he can't snitch.

507
00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.710
But it's always like the time where you really actually want it to is when you

508
00:33:36.711 --> 00:33:41.520
see the person board first late and they're like,
um,

509
00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.970
there's no room.
Wouldn't be like,
well dickhead.
Yeah.

510
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:49.350
In a 34 c actually put his bag of shit.
Yeah.
Shit son.
Yeah.

511
00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:53.300
So there is room.
Yeah,
if you get his,
his fucking,

512
00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:57.160
but the food thing always bothered me because like,

513
00:33:57.170 --> 00:34:00.080
you know what the ticket items are that people enjoy the most.

514
00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:05.120
We don't have that,
but we've got salty ass Pringles left.
We've got this,

515
00:34:05.121 --> 00:34:09.770
a coos,
coos wrap with fed out.
Like no one wants that.
You have those left.

516
00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:14.720
They always seem completely blown away when you don't want their dog shits
snack.

517
00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:20.270
Yes.
Come by with a basket and they're like,
yeah,
chips,
chocolate.
And I'm like,

518
00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.710
I'm good.
Are you sure?
You know shitty.

519
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.250
It's free garbage.
You don't want it.
I'm like,
no,
I'm good.

520
00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.370
We've pulled this out of a dumpster.
You don't want this.

521
00:34:31.371 --> 00:34:33.530
You can have all the free garbage you want.
Well,

522
00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.730
cause the thing is those aren't high ticket items.

523
00:34:35.731 --> 00:34:40.250
Like you can buy your own bag of Fritos,
a luxury gimme the good stuff.

524
00:34:40.251 --> 00:34:44.330
Give me stuff that I can't get normally and then I'll be geeked about your

525
00:34:44.331 --> 00:34:47.270
fucking snack options.
Fucking fuck.

526
00:34:47.271 --> 00:34:50.390
Fuck or do something healthier.
Dick Breath.

527
00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:56.080
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

528
00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:03.200
<v 4>this is big time.
You don't know what's going on.</v>

529
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:05.390
I was in the middle of a great thought.

530
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:10.500
What do you mean you were in the middle of saying something good?
What did I,

531
00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:15.410
what did I do?
It's about the snacks and I've forgotten it.
Oh,

532
00:35:15.411 --> 00:35:19.160
you said you wanted the Primo snacks.
Yeah.
Gimme good snacks.
Yeah,
I agree.

533
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:23.210
I agree.
It's like,
can we Hamas with like crew to tay or whatever.

534
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:27.890
You know what I'm saying?
So I feel like a virgin.
Yeah.
Has Hummus,

535
00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:30.440
but it was like pretty strong.

536
00:35:30.441 --> 00:35:35.030
I remember being real 40 after that or what about like fresh items?

537
00:35:35.031 --> 00:35:37.920
Chips in real salsa,
not that shit in a jar.

538
00:35:37.921 --> 00:35:42.060
That'd be kind of exciting on a fucking plane or a snack.
Acadamia nuts.

539
00:35:42.061 --> 00:35:46.080
I like those disappointing thing is that you're on the major carriers and they

540
00:35:46.081 --> 00:35:50.520
have the most dog shit.
Yeah,
like Delta American food.
Really bad.

541
00:35:50.521 --> 00:35:53.810
Virgin's got the best food options.
You're right of all of them.
Yeah.

542
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:58.770
Now if you go international [inaudible] shit.
Another fucking story.
How come?

543
00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:02.790
See they can do it on the international flights were on our way to Africa.

544
00:36:02.791 --> 00:36:07.590
Take pride in that shit.
We had hot fudge Sundaes on our way to Africa.

545
00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:11.070
Why can't we have hot fudge Sundaes and away from DC to la?
Yeah.

546
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:16.140
We Wa wa Wa wa Wa wa Wa wa or why aren't,

547
00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:20.910
How about lay flats are are from La to New York,

548
00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:26.020
San Francisco to New York,
but la to Philly.
La to DC.
Right.

549
00:36:26.021 --> 00:36:30.870
Just as far as country.
Nope.
Why can't you get away from it?
I'm asleep.

550
00:36:30.871 --> 00:36:34.350
Yo.
Yeah.
I want to sit here.
Yeah.
Only on why do they do that,

551
00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:37.890
that that was so I used to get the lay downs from Atlanta to la.

552
00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:42.590
That was so that's on accident basically?
Yeah.
That's an international,
oh,
right.

553
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.660
They're using to get here before it goes overseas again.
Oh,

554
00:36:45.661 --> 00:36:47.910
those are great though.
Basically by by chance.

555
00:36:47.911 --> 00:36:49.410
And I would always sit with rappers.

556
00:36:49.411 --> 00:36:52.320
There would always be like some miscellaneous wrapper in the miscellaneous.

557
00:36:52.321 --> 00:36:55.890
What would,
I don't know who I like.
Timble easy is not miscellaneous.

Dan Umma,

609
00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:37.260
Stan Ama.
Let's see.
Oh this is from a,
I remember last week,

610
00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:41.700
um,
I don't know if you remember last week,
but uh,
the um,

611
00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:45.620
big star of our show was this,
this lady.

612
00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:48.630
<v 1>No,
I don't want to talk about her when she smells her finger.</v>

613
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:52.820
<v 7>Um,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

614
00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:57.230
<v 1>It's just Raunchy ass and shit.
Smell.
We're going back to her.</v>

615
00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.690
<v 7>No.
Well there was an email about it.</v>

616
00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:02.450
<v 1>Oh,
okay.
My ass films.
I remember.</v>

617
00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.060
<v 7>Okay.</v>

618
00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:08.060
So she made the point that she hadn't showered in days to be exact.

619
00:41:08.161 --> 00:41:13.161
So the email says the asshole lady is a liar.

620
00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:18.180
Hey Mommy's due to the nice lady and the opening clip.

621
00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.520
The how you say asshole lady.

622
00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:25.920
Don't believe a word she says when she tries to make light of her non shower

623
00:41:25.921 --> 00:41:26.670
situation.

624
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:31.670
I camp for a living in other words goes camping may to December.

625
00:41:32.821 --> 00:41:34.940
I'm camp,
I'm camping Monday through Friday,

626
00:41:34.941 --> 00:41:39.700
so I'm sure you can imagine that means no showers.
Oh Holy God.

627
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:44.330
Well she has a voluntarily stuffing that nasty pudgy finger into her be hole

628
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:46.820
after three days of non showers.

629
00:41:46.821 --> 00:41:51.050
You trust me around day two of my rig weekly ritual.

630
00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.130
It gets bad.

631
00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:56.660
Don't listen to the lady when she says she wants a dirty ass hole in her face,

632
00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:01.490
she better get her life because nothing about the must is a good thing.

633
00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:06.140
Uh,
about the uh,
maybe the Musk is a good thing as Tom said,

634
00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:07.610
she is gnarliest.
Fuck.

635
00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.370
Thank you guys for keeping my weeks in the woods high and tight.

636
00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:14.210
You guys rock Travis.
I mean,
Travis is making a good point,

637
00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:18.640
which is that he's saying there's probably some bullshit when it comes to this.

638
00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:22.400
<v 1>Wait a minute.
Now you guys are comparing Ana.
Yeah.</v>

639
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:26.090
When it comes to butthole smells.
Yeah.

640
00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:27.900
Comparing apples to oranges.

641
00:42:27.901 --> 00:42:32.901
Meaning the feminine Pastaria is different in consistency in activity level to

642
00:42:34.021 --> 00:42:38.790
the male pastaria my point Ben Travis could be running,

643
00:42:38.791 --> 00:42:41.820
jumping,
doing things,
real camp camp stuff.

644
00:42:41.821 --> 00:42:46.040
Whereas our girl is probably just sitting in a room taking dumps.
Taking Dom's.

645
00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:50.010
Yeah.
So you can't compare those two things.
Plus we've discussed hair.

646
00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:53.610
<v 7>Uh,
I hear what you're saying.</v>

647
00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:56.010
I do hear it.
I do.

648
00:42:56.730 --> 00:43:00.940
The court recognizes your point.
Yes.
Yana and it,

649
00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:06.000
she might not be on Travis level of Gnarly,

650
00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:10.680
but right.
This is three days of no shower.

651
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:12.230
It's not a good situation.
No,

652
00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:15.110
<v 1>it's not going to smell.
Okay.
Anyway,
I'll tell you what.</v>

653
00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:19.490
I went one day without showering cause our son has refused to Napa lately.

654
00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:25.100
I didn't shower on Sunday.
By Sunday night I was out of my mind.

655
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:28.730
I was exhausted but I had the shower cause I'm like,
you know what dude,

656
00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:32.720
this is disgusting.
Yeah.
I feel the same way.
I cannot go more than a day.

657
00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.770
Unacceptable.
The most I go is like unacceptable.
You wake up,

658
00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:42.230
if you're running late,
you go to where you go.
Yeah.
And you go to bed that night.

659
00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.380
The next morning you're like,
I didn't fucking get in the shower.
I mean,

660
00:43:45.381 --> 00:43:48.890
that's how I feel.
I Dunno what's,
I mean,
yeah.
A 24 hours,

661
00:43:48.891 --> 00:43:52.970
man hours is usually the Max for me.
Did a snarl aids.
It's this gross.

662
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.140
You want to be,
you know,
hygenic come on.
I do.
I like the way I shower.

663
00:43:57.141 --> 00:43:58.910
I don't like the funky dude.

664
00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:03.400
<v 7>We're different though in that you're more of a kick your day off.
No,
no.</v>

665
00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:06.490
You're like,
uh,
get the day started.
Shower.
Absolutely.

666
00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:10.050
I always shower a lot before bed,
so if I'm like ready to go right,

667
00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.380
<v 1>I'm like,
I gotta get a quick shower first.
You know why?</v>

668
00:44:12.381 --> 00:44:17.381
Because my mother taught me that showering at night is kind of bullshit because

669
00:44:17.421 --> 00:44:21.080
then you go in your bed and you're like sleeping and all your dead skin or

670
00:44:21.081 --> 00:44:24.440
you're still,
you're filthy overnight.
I'm a sweaty sleeper.
Yeah.
You know me,

671
00:44:24.441 --> 00:44:27.320
I like it nice and warm.
So I sweat at night.
Yeah.

672
00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:31.530
So in the morning I got to get all that funk off and I don't have a sams.
So

673
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:36.810
<v 4>when you're a bear,
yeah.
You hibernate.
I like showering before bed.
It feels,</v>

674
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.390
I feel ready for sleep.
I like to shower before bed.

675
00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:41.940
I like to shower in the morning to maybe I should start doing to shower.

676
00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:45.060
Oh sure you want to do that big spender.

677
00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:48.460
<v 1>Talking about big spender.</v>

678
00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:56.380
Oh,
a big spender.
You blew my mind.

679
00:44:56.381 --> 00:44:59.410
I've been meaning to bring this topic up for four weeks now.

680
00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:03.250
Cause because he blew my mind,
dude w you know,

681
00:45:03.251 --> 00:45:08.251
every morning I put on Pandora and we listen to nice music and that the baby

682
00:45:08.441 --> 00:45:09.820
jeans,
daddy genes,
Mama June's,

683
00:45:09.821 --> 00:45:13.870
we all have breakfast together and it's in the background and the ads come on

684
00:45:13.871 --> 00:45:17.410
with Pandora and I just,
whatever you ignore it.
I just pushed through them.
Yeah.

685
00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:21.120
<v 4>And the other day we used your phone,
right?
Plugs it in.</v>

686
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:25.950
Oh this lose my Pandora account.
And you're like,
I have no ads.
I go,

687
00:45:25.951 --> 00:45:30.700
wait a minute,
you have no ads on your Pandora.
You Go,
yeah,
I paid for it.
And

688
00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:35.990
<v 1>your brain exploded.
Oh
I</v>

689
00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:44.580
couldn't believe.
How does that hinder?

690
00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:48.840
Or You just suffer through the commercial.
Oh Man.
So much better.
Right.

691
00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:53.070
So here's the thing,
I started doing it.
Well first you were like,
Oh fuck,

692
00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:56.010
I even do something like I really,

693
00:45:56.011 --> 00:45:59.520
it was such a mindblower gene that you pay for Pandora.

694
00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:03.360
I guarantee people listening to this are like,
who pays for Pandora?

695
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:07.530
I think it's such a luxury,
like it's bananas.
How much is it?

696
00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:13.030
<v 4>I think it's either three 99 or four 99 a month.
That's a lot.
Yeah.</v>

697
00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:16.420
But man,
when you're enjoying something though,
like on that station,

698
00:46:16.421 --> 00:46:20.920
and then every few that gets a an ad,
it's terrible.

699
00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:24.700
And I listened to Brazilian music so they'll play like Spanish ads,

700
00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:28.750
which isn't Portuguese.
It's insulting.

701
00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:32.800
But uh,
yeah,
I couldn't believe it.
But now I'm on board.

702
00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:37.420
You've converted me to a paid Pandora listener.
It's worth it.
It kind of is.

703
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:39.610
I don't know though.
It's that whole four bucks.

704
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:46.250
<v 1>Oh
sure.</v>

705
00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:50.360
You want us to spend that as Christina for you.

706
00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.120
I seriously did have that like

707
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:58.120
Ford that can we afford

708
00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:05.320
<v 4>Joey?
Joey would not pay for it.</v>

709
00:47:05.321 --> 00:47:08.950
I wouldn't fuck with Lincoln den or Pandora.
Pride is even listening to Pandora.

710
00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:12.250
No,
not a chance.
There's a 0% chance

711
00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:15.890
anyways.

712
00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:20.890
Bow fucking blew my dog brain apart and you can handle

713
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:25.490
<v 1>whatever I'm using.
Power tools,
workshops,
I can't use the doorbell rings.</v>

714
00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:30.250
So I modified a wireless doorbell so that it turns on a,
instead of just playing

715
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:33.480
<v 4>a toe,
here's how to make one.
Oh No,
please don't know.</v>

716
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:36.970
Finding the wireless doorbell.
I don't need to know.

717
00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:43.200
This is boring circuit board immediately next to the AC DC to DC converter.

718
00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:47.910
How boring is this is two years.
There's a chart now.
Dot.

719
00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:53.000
Ac sign.
Signboard more serious.
A dcis is too complicated for me.
A capacitor.

720
00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:55.130
So the whole idea,
I don't even know the president.

721
00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:58.510
How can I figure this out for your brain's dead right now?

722
00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:03.500
We need to know circuit board.
I'm losing my mind.

723
00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:06.830
Easiest way to do this.
It's the chart.
We understand how this stuff works.
People,

724
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:08.620
people's brains are labeled with a negative.

725
00:48:08.621 --> 00:48:12.270
It's just so hard and negative line at the power supply on the other side of the

726
00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:15.700
positive.
By the way.
No,
the,
I just,
um,

727
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.740
I got here,
you know,

728
00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:22.960
I just got in from DC and I walk in the house and our nanny's here and she goes,

729
00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:28.000
you look tired.
And I go,
ah,
yeah,
I am.
She was Matty tired.
Yeah.

730
00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:33.340
And I go,
thank you.
Yeah.
She's like,
just nods.
Like,
yeah.
She tells,

731
00:48:33.341 --> 00:48:38.320
she told me,
I like,
sorry this morning.
Did you sleep last night?
And I'm like,

732
00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:42.940
no,
not really.
Yeah,
it's very old.

733
00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:45.220
The day.
Very sick

734
00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:52.600
to die.
Cancer,
AIDS problems.

735
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:59.860
Um,
no.
And I go,
uh,
I go,
hey,

736
00:48:59.861 --> 00:49:03.040
so don't forget this week is our getaway.
Tom and I,
and she goes,
oh,

737
00:49:03.041 --> 00:49:06.640
that is very good.
Very good.
You guys need to sleep.
I'm like,

738
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:13.030
I get it.
We look like shit.
I know.
Yeah.
I need that arrests.

739
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:17.980
Thank you.
Have you seen,
by the way of I played for you,
this guy,
uh,

740
00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:20.240
the dresses up like a hippo.
Have you seen that?

741
00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:25.630
You seen in the wild most the hippos.
I've seen a piece of it,

742
00:49:25.631 --> 00:49:28.750
yes.
This is amazing.
Yes,
I've seen it.
Yes.

743
00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.240
<v 11>I'm on the trail of a giant</v>

744
00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:38.260
when it comes to land mammals,
they're terrifying margins.
Oh yeah.

745
00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:41.380
Weighing up to 6,000 pounds.
Oh my life.

746
00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.060
That's two tons race adventure.
One time.

747
00:49:44.061 --> 00:49:48.340
My plan is to keep it within arm's reach of these formidable gladiators.

748
00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:52.540
You know,
there is crazy headphones are not happy

749
00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.400
<v 4>are the deadliest animals in Africa.
I believe it.</v>

750
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:59.270
I mean the dead list is in terms of the kill the most people every year.

751
00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:01.700
Really Hippos more than like than anything.

752
00:50:01.701 --> 00:50:05.000
Lions are shit really shit that can run fast.

753
00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:09.410
They can actually haul ass,
you know,
for,
not for as long,

754
00:50:09.411 --> 00:50:14.150
but these guys can chase a person down.
Just come at you in half,

755
00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:19.220
like split you in half.
Well,
and that's the misnomer.
I would have whatever,

756
00:50:19.221 --> 00:50:21.740
miss whatever.
What they do in children's books.

757
00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:25.520
You grew up thinking that hippos are like the friendliness,
coolest animals.

758
00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:29.520
They're not cool.
No.
Chuck e,
they used to have a singing hymns.
Yeah,

759
00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:30.950
they're fucking lethal.
Yeah.

760
00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:34.220
You shouldn't be teaching kids that they're friendly and wearing dresses and

761
00:50:34.221 --> 00:50:36.790
singers.
Motherfucker,
by the way,
is this guy,

762
00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:42.510
it sounds like,
sounds like bad bite it.
Let me see if this says it a little bit,

763
00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:47.270
but yeah,
it is good.
It is this guy.
Oh my God.
Wow.

764
00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:49.670
No Way.
You guys part two of the bad bike guy.

765
00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.990
<v 7>I got a bad bike guy.
Yeah.
Is it on extraction to,</v>

766
00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:58.500
to get hippo sweat.
That's what it,
no one's actually no sweat.
No one's actually,

767
00:50:58.501 --> 00:51:03.501
I think a con like captured hippo sweat from a hippo in that like in the moment.

768
00:51:05.581 --> 00:51:06.414
Where's sport?

769
00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:10.470
<v 4>Is there a reason for that?
Why do we need the sweat?
Maybe.</v>

770
00:51:10.471 --> 00:51:12.000
Maybe it's because nobody gives a shit.

771
00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:17.300
<v 7>It's it.
It's assumed that their sweat has antibacterial properties.</v>

772
00:51:17.310 --> 00:51:19.730
Scientist want to research.
Oh,
okay.
Uh,

773
00:51:19.731 --> 00:51:22.910
so he makes a fake hippo body.

774
00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:28.040
<v 4>That's bananas.
Yeah.
This guy's a total crazy and there was</v>

775
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:36.740
one of my favorite clips by,
yeah,
I love that.

776
00:51:36.741 --> 00:51:39.680
He just keeps saying it and he doesn't move over and over.
Yeah.
Good.

777
00:51:39.681 --> 00:51:42.190
A bad boy covered him back on all those ways.

778
00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:45.410
<v 11>If the secrets of hippo sweater unlocked,</v>

779
00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:49.580
some scientists believe it could result in powerful new antibiotic.

780
00:51:49.581 --> 00:51:51.440
How one block for humans,

781
00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:56.720
but no one's ever retrace went from alive and drug wild hippo.
Well,

782
00:51:56.721 --> 00:51:59.720
yeah,
I'm going to give it a trial.

783
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:02.640
<v 4>No,
you're not.
That is not cool.</v>

784
00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:07.350
<v 11>The one thing is clear.
I need an air hose.
Don't fuck around.</v>

785
00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:10.110
That's one thing that's clear.
The idea.

786
00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:15.390
A hippo hide out.
Are you serious?
Guy's out of his mind.
This guy,

787
00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:21.400
he's building a new suit to apprentice wild hippos so I can get near enough

788
00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:24.870
to capture the sweat,

789
00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:29.710
<v 4>sweat or skin fucking white people.
Man.
It's so fucking stupid.</v>

790
00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:34.610
So dumb.
This soda.
Um,
yeah.
This is such an old white guy thing to do.

791
00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:38.570
This is how fucking Steve ruined got killed doing stupid shit.

792
00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:41.300
How have we not learned the lesson?
Stop fucking with them.

793
00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:46.220
<v 11>Some funny posts.
Stake.
Yeah.
No,
it's ready for deployment.
Here's the thing.</v>

794
00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:49.110
This guy had a,
our strategy is to carry the hiphop

795
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:52.030
<v 4>had like a,
you know,
a real production team make this thing.</v>

796
00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:55.450
It looks like some shit you'd see at a kid's birthday party.
You know,
like shit.

797
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:57.900
To me,
if the kid was like,
I like hippos,

798
00:52:57.910 --> 00:53:00.390
you'd throw that in the pool and be like,
there's a hippo right there.
You know?

799
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:03.480
And then he's going to go out in the wild in Africa with this

800
00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:08.530
<v 11>so close to them.
I'll try hard and leave me alone inside.
Oh No.</v>

801
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:12.680
<v 4>Life is her entire live,
bro.
Fucking way.</v>

802
00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:16.370
How much do they have to pay you to do this?
Oh,
I would be so terrified.

803
00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:21.160
No untold millions.
Look if those fucking things.
No.

804
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:22.290
Did Brexit,

805
00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:27.230
<v 11>this guy.
This guy is insane.</v>

806
00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:30.530
What are you doing dude?
I mean,

807
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:33.470
what do you think it would take for that hippo to run through that thing?
A lot.

808
00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:36.150
A lot of effort.
There's a giant hipbone near shore.

809
00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:40.010
I just need to get close enough to open my,

810
00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:41.640
how are you going to extend the scraper?

811
00:53:43.090 --> 00:53:46.510
<v 4>This guy's out of his fucking mind.
Did you think a hippo can't smell that?</v>

812
00:53:46.511 --> 00:53:50.420
You're not a hippo and me?
It's funny you bring that up.
Oh,
because

813
00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:53.910
<v 11>you have a bad sense.
Typos can take a dip for relief.</v>

814
00:53:55.830 --> 00:54:00.150
I've got to tough it out on land and it was pretty nerve wracking.

815
00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:03.690
<v 4>You saw him,
he got up with it.
Yes.
That was terrible.</v>

816
00:54:04.330 --> 00:54:07.180
<v 11>Just sitting inside the second not knowing what's going to happen.</v>

817
00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:12.380
You really,
yeah.
I have to rely on my video monitor,

818
00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:17.170
even know what's going on outside.
It just scary.
It's just scary.

819
00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:19.780
<v 4>Yeah.
Here's what I meant though.
He didn't meet those.
What?</v>

820
00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:22.980
How much do you think he does get paid?
Like you can't make that much.
I know.

821
00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:27.040
This is not for the money and this is like definitely not 1500 a week.

822
00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:31.360
It's more than that.
But he's not making,
he's now president.
Let's just say that.

823
00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:32.213
Right,
right.

824
00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:36.750
<v 11>Is just overpowering
since I covered this one,</v>

825
00:54:36.751 --> 00:54:40.730
that burnt down so that it's baked in the sun and it just,

826
00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:45.460
so the hippos,
thank you sir.
It's overpowering.
It's high house.

827
00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:52.080
He doesn't do anything.
That's the way

828
00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:57.080
<v 4>so dramatic.</v>

829
00:54:57.140 --> 00:55:01.280
This guy goes overpowering because there's,

830
00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:04.340
there's a hippo shit all over this fucking fake thing.
Yeah.

831
00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:07.550
And it's just cooking.
So,
but that's,

832
00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:10.490
but that proves the Mortier point of,
uh,
you know,

833
00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:15.440
the hippos w would be able to smell him if not smell these humans.
Course.

834
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:16.303
Yeah.

835
00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:20.370
<v 11>Oh God.</v>

836
00:55:20.770 --> 00:55:24.550
I hope he gets attacked is definitely helped.

837
00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:29.990
The believability factor d coin.

838
00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:35.620
The first time I deployed with Madonna and Bailey and a come so close,

839
00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:40.420
my decoy definitely old promise as a stationary blind,

840
00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:45.190
my spirits had been raised.
Man,

841
00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:50.280
I wish this had footage of him scraping sweat and the Hippo Midas guy and Ila

842
00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:54.850
dance.
Ma'Am.
He didn't pay it off with a close and count.

843
00:55:56.110 --> 00:55:58.250
<v 4>Boy,
I'm really going to bad paid.</v>

844
00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:04.340
Did he get the sweater?
Yeah.

845
00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:09.620
That is the bad bike guy.
That's hilarious.
God I a dip.
She,

846
00:56:09.621 --> 00:56:10.454
yeah,

847
00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:12.650
<v 11>which just overbearing in here.</v>

848
00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:18.150
<v 4>That's why would you put yourself in harm's way?
I Dunno.</v>

849
00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:20.400
It is entertaining though.
I'm glad he's doing it.
Yeah.

850
00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:23.190
Thank you for entertaining us and putting your life on the line multiple times.

851
00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:25.780
And that Steve Irwin,
I loved him.
I mean,

852
00:56:25.781 --> 00:56:29.560
he was the original guy who's doing all this stuff,
right?
Yeah.

853
00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:33.440
He was so cool.
It's such a bummer.
He's gone.
Well,
yeah,

854
00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:38.860
it is actually right.
Yeah.
I miss that guy.
He was great.
Yeah,

855
00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:43.120
he really was.
He was,
he was so enthusiastic.
He,

856
00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:46.000
he had a real enthusiasm for all these animals.

857
00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:51.370
I remember he was such a Dork and he was always like,
ah,
it's beautiful.
Crikey.

858
00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:56.520
Yeah,
he was,
his kids are doing it now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ben Day and the,

859
00:56:56.540 --> 00:56:58.370
and the sun to band day.

860
00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:03.590
And I know that bendy and Mindy to children check us out.

861
00:57:04.091 --> 00:57:05.890
We have the female version of this now.

862
00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:10.870
<v 2>So when was the last time you got off?
Oh boy.
Four days ago.</v>

863
00:57:11.530 --> 00:57:16.180
A couple of days.
Wow.
See you probably have a nice big buildup in there.

864
00:57:16.181 --> 00:57:20.340
Don't shoot a lot of sticky.
Come in those balls.

865
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:22.503
<v 4>Amen.</v>

866
00:57:25.610 --> 00:57:29.150
Seems to be the question.
Nobody knows the answer to that.

867
00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:31.730
Anybody wants to know?

868
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:39.140
My detectives looking for the same APP.
Same thing.
Everyone's looking forward.

869
00:57:39.141 --> 00:57:40.190
I hope we find it.

870
00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:43.680
<v 2>Yeah.
The lot of sticky come in those bars.</v>

871
00:57:44.310 --> 00:57:47.900
<v 4>Where's the,
Jeez.
So everyone's,
you know,</v>

872
00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:52.860
it's like these people are like that guy in the hippo outfit tiding and

873
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:57.670
different things.
Trying to find this stuff.
Right?
People.
Scientists.
Wow.
Jeez.

874
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.730
I sure hope we get an answer so far.

875
00:58:00.731 --> 00:58:03.680
Everybody just asks where it is and they say it can't seem to find it.

876
00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:09.730
Maybe.
Maybe president Trump can put some money towards it.

877
00:58:09.731 --> 00:58:13.110
I know he's working on his uh,
financial planning fellow Americans.

878
00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:18.600
There's one mystery we have not yet solved in this country and that is where all

879
00:58:19.211 --> 00:58:23.530
the is.
If you have hot,
sticky,
common your balls,

880
00:58:23.531 --> 00:58:24.430
please step forward.

881
00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:30.790
You know how many people would come forward?
I'm sorry,

882
00:58:30.791 --> 00:58:33.460
how many dudes would Custer president,
Mr President.

883
00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:37.780
I definitely have a hot sticky coming my balls.

884
00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:45.340
Thank you.
Thank you for
serving your country.

885
00:58:46.330 --> 00:58:47.920
Proud American.
You know these guys,

886
00:58:47.921 --> 00:58:49.660
they could have kept all their come to themselves.

887
00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:52.690
They thought about the rest of us and they came forward.

888
00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:02.600
<v 12>Patriot that I'm going to demonstrate now is the hemiparetic gait shit.</v>

889
00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:05.000
This gate,
if we were to,

890
00:59:05.790 --> 00:59:08.420
you can demonstrate it a walk,

891
00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:12.920
the extension of the leg and internal rotation so the leg is too long.

892
00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:14.510
We get circumduction

893
00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:19.820
with the product side as well.

894
00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:21.890
Is it an epic show to me is very much involved

895
00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:25.850
<v 1>with the shoulder flection at the elbow.</v>

896
00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:30.920
Pronation of the wrist just tucked under in a cortical fist.

897
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:34.630
So this is,
it's a retard one bay by the heavy paretic.

898
00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:39.020
What we used to make fun of them go and you make fun of her like normal,

899
00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:42.590
retarded people.
Is this how you pretend?
Yeah,
it's called a retard walk.

900
00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:43.850
Could actually here.

901
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:48.760
Then you go as well as we have circumduction what?

902
00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:49.753
You're terrible.

903
00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:55.240
What we used to make fun of fraternity people and entry school extremity posture

904
00:59:55.441 --> 00:59:58.560
did,
did the,
did the Quarter Cup posture turn amity,

905
00:59:59.150 --> 01:00:02.120
is there a conducted?
This is hilarious.

906
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:04.960
I don't feel like I'm appreciating everything.

907
01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:08.840
<v 4>I know it's so wide as the video even exist.
Who is he?</v>

908
01:00:09.010 --> 01:00:12.330
He's the teaching you to walk like that is exactly it guys.

909
01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:14.010
We all want to make fun of talking to people,

910
01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:17.580
but here's the technical terms and ways to do that correctly.

911
01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:21.660
If you're going to mock somebody,
you gotta know what you're doing.
Now.

912
01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.940
Once you find the calm that we've all been looking for,

913
01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:28.780
I want you to pay attention and I'll show you how to walk like a tart.
Ready,

914
01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:36.750
right.
The hemi Hemi pledget gate,

915
01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:41.610
but hemiplegic gait,
hemiplegic gait.
That thing got a Hemi.
That's right.

916
01:00:41.790 --> 01:00:45.990
That must be what it's in reference to be it.
That's a really good or retarded.

917
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:51.240
There you go.
There you go.
And there you go.
Oh Man.

918
01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:55.300
Do you think they look,
kids make fun of retarded kids anymore?
No.
No.

919
01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:58.020
When you think of this shit we used to say to each other,

920
01:00:58.021 --> 01:01:01.380
we call each other faggot.
Retard.
I've noticed that.

921
01:01:01.830 --> 01:01:06.670
And the casual retarded on stage doesn't fly.
No,

922
01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:11.250
it,
it's not like you see you fee.
It's not like there's a huge backlash,

923
01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:16.050
but people don't like react to it like,
ah,
yeah.
Like it's not cool anymore.

924
01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:20.060
It's definitely not.
It's not.
It's on the no fly list and it's so fun.

925
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:24.780
It's so amazing how a lot of sticky,
calm in those box.
Yeah.

926
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:27.303
<v 13>Yeah.</v>

927
01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:31.580
<v 4>I almost wish we could make a tee shirt.
Where's the comm?
But Oh,
we could.</v>

928
01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:34.670
I feel like that won't be a big seller.
Hey,
why?

929
01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:40.550
Cause you expand on your,
I thought for a second.
I just felt like,
guys,

930
01:01:40.551 --> 01:01:44.660
why aren't you buying the,
where's the come shirt wearing it to church?

931
01:01:44.661 --> 01:01:48.460
Wearing it to your family functions school.
Yeah.
Duh.

932
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:53.600
We've invested in this really cool design.
It's a designer shirt.

933
01:01:53.601 --> 01:01:57.600
It's actually a James perse shirt.
What would it be?
Um,
would it be like a,
like a,

934
01:01:57.601 --> 01:02:00.820
a guy like,
you know what I mean?
Yeah.
Explorer.
Yes.

935
01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:04.820
Looking out maybe some Minox he's glassy forum.
Forum.
Yeah.

936
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:08.090
Where's the cup or be shrugging shrugging your shoulders.

937
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:12.920
Where's the fucking comment?
I can't find it anywhere.
It's such an important,

938
01:02:12.921 --> 01:02:16.880
thoughtful question.
No Man.
It's very true.

939
01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.500
We're having our mommy getaway tomorrow.
You excited?

940
01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:25.350
<v 7>What are you looking forward to doing?
Sleeping.
Me Too.
This is sleeping.
Yeah,</v>

941
01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:28.290
we do that.
We tried to just once a month where and um,
you know,

942
01:02:28.291 --> 01:02:33.150
we don't go far or recommend it to any young parents.
If you can,

943
01:02:33.151 --> 01:02:38.130
you have a,
your folks or your,
you know,
you trusted,
loved one,

944
01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:42.300
come over and watch your child for one evening and you go,

945
01:02:42.301 --> 01:02:45.360
even if it's down the street,
you have like a little getaway.
Yeah.

946
01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:47.250
It's a definite necessity,
man.

947
01:02:47.370 --> 01:02:51.270
We put our kid in a little crate and we put a bottle in there and when you put

948
01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:54.660
the,
the blotter thing,
he can let the water thing in there.

949
01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:58.850
You leave them some diapers,
you go.
Just change yourself when it happens.
Yeah.

950
01:02:59.510 --> 01:03:03.350
<v 1>Yeah.
I'm excited to sleep too.
I'm really excited to just to do nothing.
Oh yeah.</v>

951
01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:07.590
I like to just sit and stare as my favorite.
Yeah.

952
01:03:07.790 --> 01:03:08.990
Staring is a lot of fun.

953
01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:13.940
Or just TV watching's or I really want to drink during the day that that's like

954
01:03:13.941 --> 01:03:17.840
when you can't really do as a parent of a young child.
Yeah.
I mean you can,

955
01:03:17.841 --> 01:03:19.400
but you're not very good at parenting,
right?

956
01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:23.920
<v 7>You do.
Yeah.
You can have a sip of one.
Yeah.</v>

957
01:03:23.921 --> 01:03:26.320
But yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

958
01:03:26.830 --> 01:03:29.590
<v 1>It's not,
it's not fun when you're like,
I got to take care of another life.</v>

959
01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:32.950
I'm responsible for somebody.
It takes a while.
You got to do this,

960
01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:36.520
<v 7>man,
everyone's got to do this.
But I mean I think it's also,
by the way,</v>

961
01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:41.600
it's has nothing to do with parental status also,
whether if you're

962
01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:45.940
single or have no kids,
everyone.

963
01:03:45.941 --> 01:03:50.350
I'm a big advocate for a vacation at a time away.
You got to find the calm.

964
01:03:50.590 --> 01:03:54.340
You got to find that come.
Yeah.
You got to take a break and just look for it.

965
01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:59.080
<v 1>I agree.
Cause you don't,
no one's ever going to find it.
Well too.</v>

966
01:03:59.081 --> 01:04:00.670
Cause the thing is you,
uh,
you know,

967
01:04:00.671 --> 01:04:04.150
you realize how short life is and you're like,
dude,
what are we doing?

968
01:04:04.151 --> 01:04:08.710
Just grinding,
grinding,
like take a day man.
Absolutely.

969
01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:13.480
Madonna said it best just one day out of life.
It would be,
it will be so nice.

970
01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:17.090
Oh Wow.
Holiday.
She's right.
Bray.
Sorry.

971
01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:19.950
<v 7>Mean to my manager about that when you're,
I'm like,</v>

972
01:04:20.310 --> 01:04:22.950
where'd you go on vacation this year?
He's like,
oh,
I didn't go anywhere.
I know.

973
01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:25.530
No,
you got to take a vacation,
man.
You got to,

974
01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:30.450
you can't just do this shit every day of the week.
All the time.
Every week,

975
01:04:30.451 --> 01:04:32.910
every month.
No.
No matter what you do.
No.

976
01:04:32.911 --> 01:04:37.080
It makes life miserable if you're just working,
working,
working,
and actually,

977
01:04:37.081 --> 01:04:37.381
yeah.
You know,

978
01:04:37.381 --> 01:04:42.381
I realized that I get happy when I see photos of people on vacation.

979
01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:47.280
I forgot,
I see it and I'm like,
other people's vacation.
Yeah.
Like I go,
no,

980
01:04:47.281 --> 01:04:50.550
just cause I see them enjoying life.
Yeah.
You know,
like when I went there,

981
01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:50.961
I don't know,

982
01:04:50.961 --> 01:04:55.020
over there and the mountains are there in Hawaii or this and I'm just like,
ah,

983
01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:57.660
these,
these people,
like I,
I feel like all these people are doing right.

984
01:04:58.130 --> 01:05:02.840
<v 1>Yeah.
It's funny because I never,
I never think about life as something to enjoy.</v>

985
01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:05.480
Yeah.
That might just be like my eastern bloc upbringing.

986
01:05:05.481 --> 01:05:09.560
Like it's just not there.
So when we do these things,
that's a little weird.

987
01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:14.570
It forces me to like,
oh,
this is what it's for.

988
01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:18.250
You're supposed to laugh and like have fun and stuff.
Yeah.

989
01:05:18.490 --> 01:05:20.860
<v 4>Yeah.
I feel good.
And you know,
do fucking yoga.</v>

990
01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:25.343
<v 10>Okay,</v>

991
01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:39.420
<v 4>good.
I like her deck.
Yoga fart.
Have you farted during yoga?</v>

992
01:05:39.850 --> 01:05:44.790
Uh,
I've had to fart during one of the few yoga classes I took.
Yeah,

993
01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:49.890
I've had to fart during pilots too.
Oh
yeah.
But I didn't,

994
01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:54.030
I didn't fart.
I've held it like eyes bugging out,

995
01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:58.690
you know?
Yeah.
You know,
I've been singing at karate,
gets in some weird positions.

996
01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:04.450
So I went to see the chiropractor today and I had to Fart when he,

997
01:06:04.451 --> 01:06:07.860
he's like,
okay,
now we're going to,
you know,
when he starts to do the adjustments,

998
01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:11.380
I was like,
oh dude,
I got one in the chamber.
Like he could push down on you.

999
01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:16.280
[inaudible]

1000
01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:21.720
like that in front of him.
He'd be like,

1001
01:06:21.810 --> 01:06:25.880
where's the Fart?
Or He'd be like,
I found the farmer found them.
I don't know.

1002
01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:30.900
Do you really wish I went in front of him?
Speaking of farts,

1003
01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:35.530
we got an email,
a double pipe,
classic secret recipe.
Oh.

1004
01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:39.250
I drank a Kombucha to loosen up the pipes from Quito.

1005
01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:44.400
Baby browns then followed it up with my first ZVM ginger root beer.

1006
01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:46.230
About half an hour later,

1007
01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:51.620
the zebra gave me wicked burp and my third burp was matched by an accidental

1008
01:06:51.781 --> 01:06:56.640
fart that had some serious pressure behind it.
They were both so loud.

1009
01:06:57.090 --> 01:06:58.710
I didn't know which was which.

1010
01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:03.150
But all I know is that it was the second best moment in my life,

1011
01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:08.760
second only to the birth of my children.
Try it out.
Happy Double Piping Mario.

1012
01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:10.170
Wow.
Wow.

1013
01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:14.950
Mario with the formula there now I'm interested is are two very uh,

1014
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.730
gas heavy beverages.
Absolutely.
And Z via.

1015
01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:21.360
Absolutely.
You know,

1016
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:26.460
people have different ways of achieving their goals and um,
you know,
this is,

1017
01:07:26.461 --> 01:07:31.461
this guy's going heavy on the beverage and just seeing like maybe that makes

1018
01:07:32.101 --> 01:07:35.940
sense.
So cause all that gas has got to find a way out.
Maybe that is a secret.

1019
01:07:35.941 --> 01:07:37.190
You double up on them.
No,

1020
01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:42.380
it's really thought provoking about Mario's plan is that Kombucha is designed

1021
01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:44.670
for intestinal health.

1022
01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:49.780
That's the whole point is that it creates farts and theZ via,

1023
01:07:49.830 --> 01:07:51.850
as we know from this show creates burp.

1024
01:07:51.851 --> 01:07:56.040
So you're really looking at increasing your chances of a double pipe classic.

1025
01:07:56.041 --> 01:07:58.350
Now there's no such thing as a perfect recipe,

1026
01:07:59.810 --> 01:08:03.800
but you can definitely up the probability of having one with this formula.

1027
01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:08.190
I think this is genius.
I really,
really serious the whole,

1028
01:08:08.330 --> 01:08:09.560
I feel like here's what the,

1029
01:08:09.561 --> 01:08:12.660
there's like very few topics in life I can really get excited about.

1030
01:08:12.661 --> 01:08:16.310
Like philosophy.
Yeah.
Uh,
reality,

1031
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:20.360
<v 1>television,
burping and farting.
I could talk about those four topics,</v>

1032
01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:24.530
hours,
days,
whole show on him could and you are,

1033
01:08:24.970 --> 01:08:28.310
you have done.
I do.
Yeah.
You do all the time

1034
01:08:29.810 --> 01:08:33.920
in therapy.
I love talking about mental health.
I think it's fascinating.
Yeah,

1035
01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:36.000
right?
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1036
01:08:36.370 --> 01:08:40.380
<v 10>Yeah.
Oh yes.
Yes.</v>

1037
01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:48.740
Major,
Major.

1038
01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.950
I'm excited because I'm going to follow your lead.

1039
01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:56.200
You're going to do it well here,
here,
what it's like before you do

1040
01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:01.480
<v 1>so number one,</v>

1041
01:09:01.481 --> 01:09:06.481
I had my crown replaced now just like our refrigerators brought to you.

1042
01:09:08.610 --> 01:09:12.610
Um,
I had a crown that was bothering me for five years.

1043
01:09:12.611 --> 01:09:17.140
Every time I would eat food gets stuck around the gum under it and I'd have to

1044
01:09:17.141 --> 01:09:21.550
go to pains,
the floss,
and it was hurting every time.
Five years.

1045
01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:24.910
Much like the thing of like,

1046
01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:28.780
why don't we just buy more phone chargers instead of having one in the house

1047
01:09:28.781 --> 01:09:31.210
that you and I would take turns with?
I was like,
oh,

1048
01:09:31.211 --> 01:09:35.140
I should probably just get this change.
So I got that change and it's fantastic.

1049
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:38.980
I'm happy you're already,
I haven't had any problems.
It's just a surreal.

1050
01:09:39.610 --> 01:09:44.560
Now here's what I did.
I got my teeth professionally whitened at the dentist.

1051
01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:45.911
Here's the thing,

1052
01:09:45.911 --> 01:09:50.911
they don't tell you it's one hour and it's fucking excrutiatingly painful,

1053
01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:54.610
man.
That sucks.
It sucks so bad.

1054
01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:56.800
But one hour,

1055
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:58.410
<v 13>yeah.</v>

1056
01:09:58.410 --> 01:10:02.640
<v 1>Did you hear the Dang like it looks Rad.
Now here's,
here's what they do.</v>

1057
01:10:02.641 --> 01:10:04.890
Pull the plug at a certain,
here's what I did.
Yeah,
because well,

1058
01:10:04.891 --> 01:10:07.620
here's the fucking thing.
So I got two veneers on the front.

1059
01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:10.440
Those can't get darker or lighter because they're fake teeth.

1060
01:10:10.770 --> 01:10:15.330
So I have to bleach the rest of my teeth to match the two friends every couple

1061
01:10:15.330 --> 01:10:18.450
of years because your natural teeth dark and with normal stains.

1062
01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:23.550
So I tell the Ding Dong a whatever assistant there a couple of weeks ago,
hey,

1063
01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:26.310
these are veneers.
I'd like to Whiten the other teeth to match them.

1064
01:10:26.730 --> 01:10:29.700
So three quarters the way through the treatment,
by the way,

1065
01:10:29.701 --> 01:10:33.150
they put like hydrochloric acid on your teeth.
It's bleach,

1066
01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:36.030
it's fucking high powered stuff.
They,
you know,

1067
01:10:36.031 --> 01:10:39.750
they put the laser on it and then you sit there with that spreader in your mouth

1068
01:10:39.930 --> 01:10:43.720
for an hour while they apply it.
Four Times dog.
Yes.

1069
01:10:45.210 --> 01:10:47.220
And it doesn't feel good and it hurts.

1070
01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:51.840
And then what happens during that whole time breaks?
No,

1071
01:10:51.841 --> 01:10:54.480
it hurts the whole time because like when you do it at home,

1072
01:10:54.481 --> 01:10:59.250
that Gel you take home,
it's like 10% 15% what they use in the office.

1073
01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:00.750
Oh,
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1074
01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:09.423
<v 13>Wow.</v>

1075
01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:16.590
<v 1>It smells bad.
Tears come to my eyes.
That was,
it doesn't smell good.</v>

1076
01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:23.760
Sorry.
That was a perfect fart.
Thank you.
You really gotta be proud of yourself.

1077
01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:27.420
Yeah,
I'm pretty proud of that.
You caught that on,
on,
on shadow it.

1078
01:11:27.421 --> 01:11:29.280
And no disrespect to your,
so can you please go back?

1079
01:11:30.570 --> 01:11:34.050
I'm just amazed that you got the cigarettes on the pitch and then blue today.

1080
01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:38.480
It's always,
wow,
that's spectacular.
And in the professional mix.
Yeah,

1081
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:40.530
and it was right up to the area.

1082
01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:44.400
We've got to find in the time code and save it for Alice.
Yeah.
Okay.

1083
01:11:44.401 --> 01:11:46.170
Back to my story.
Yeah.
Here's the thing.

1084
01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:49.920
The Gel that you take home to do your shits and your trays,

1085
01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:54.480
it's like a fraction of the power at the dentist's office.

1086
01:11:54.481 --> 01:11:58.020
So what they're doing is they're using the highest amount of bleach.
Yeah.

1087
01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.790
They put some shit to protect your gums,

1088
01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:02.940
but that doesn't matter because it leaks out.
It'll get your gums,

1089
01:12:02.941 --> 01:12:04.950
it'll hit your tongue,
it'll hit your everything,

1090
01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:09.930
and it feels like hydrochloric acid burning it.
Fucking Hoyts.

1091
01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:14.010
Yeah.
So anyways,
I'm fucking there.
At 45 minutes,
I got a tap out.

1092
01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:17.340
It's hurting and I say to the lady,
the assistant,
I go,
hey,

1093
01:12:17.370 --> 01:12:20.700
how wide are we doing this?
Because my veneers can't lift,

1094
01:12:20.970 --> 01:12:25.110
so it's got to match.
And she goes,
oh,
you have bondings.

1095
01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:28.560
I was like,
motherfucker.
I told this is what is,

1096
01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:33.190
this was the conversation we already did.
You tell the doctor?
I go,
yeah.

1097
01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:35.800
So I go,
listen,
wipe this shit off.

1098
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:39.420
Let's see where we're at because if I get the rest,
Steve Harvey White.
Yeah.

1099
01:12:39.450 --> 01:12:43.200
And then the front two,
we've done this mistake.
I've done this mistake and know,

1100
01:12:43.930 --> 01:12:47.380
you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
So we wiped it off and I was like,
done.
I'm done.

1101
01:12:47.381 --> 01:12:51.390
Tab.
Oh,
you sure we have one?
I'm like,
no,
don't worry about it.
If I want a wider,

1102
01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:54.820
I'll come back and here's the thing.
It's pain and suffering,

1103
01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:56.740
but it's one hour of it and then you're done.

1104
01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:00.790
Versus ut Logan Mays versus taking that shit home,

1105
01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:03.700
doing it over weeks and weeks and weeks.
Burning the shit out of your gums.

1106
01:13:03.701 --> 01:13:08.350
Anyways.
He made a lot of the dentists do it.
Uh,
I mean,

1107
01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:12.720
are you trying to be perfect,
Michelle,
who's trying to win?

1108
01:13:12.721 --> 01:13:16.720
I'm not even drinking carbonated drink.
Isn't that something?

1109
01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:23.880
Yeah,
but you forget you have the perfect storm of travel day.
Oh,
I know.

1110
01:13:23.881 --> 01:13:27.960
I'm not saying it didn't happen.
I got bacteria in Washington DC.
Food.

1111
01:13:27.961 --> 01:13:30.540
You've got bacteria on plain food.
Yeah.
Bacteria and La food.

1112
01:13:30.570 --> 01:13:33.900
You've got three different cities in your guts right now flying over them.

1113
01:13:33.901 --> 01:13:37.380
And then,
yeah.
Anyway,
massive dental update.
Uh,

1114
01:13:37.381 --> 01:13:40.470
I'm glad to have this new crown.
I'm just a,
you know,

1115
01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:43.830
I'm thrilled and I can't believe I waited this long and you know what?

1116
01:13:44.190 --> 01:13:48.060
It's 1500 bucks,
but it's worth every penny.
Yeah.

1117
01:13:48.650 --> 01:13:52.730
I'm going to do it.
Not,
no,
not the whitening.
The whitening is not 1500.
The crown.

1118
01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:57.210
I know,
I know.
The whitening,
I,
you know,
yeah,
yeah.
But fucking do,

1119
01:13:57.211 --> 01:14:00.360
it's a professional does it really doing it every couple of years.
Right?

1120
01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:01.261
Of course.

1121
01:14:01.261 --> 01:14:05.400
You can only do it so long because it burns a shit out of your mouth and you're,

1122
01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:08.670
you're going to hurt.
Oh.
And then the,
the receptionist goes,

1123
01:14:08.671 --> 01:14:12.700
now you can't have red wine or anything that could stain a white t shirt because

1124
01:14:12.701 --> 01:14:14.140
your teeth are very porous.

1125
01:14:14.410 --> 01:14:17.230
Some people don't even want to do the treatment because they're like,

1126
01:14:17.231 --> 01:14:21.040
I gotta have my wine at night and want to,
well,
those people are alcoholics

1127
01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:26.020
or drink white wine that night.
You LG.

1128
01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:32.240
<v 7>Yeah,
they always do.
Fine.
Um,
this video is pretty funny.</v>

1129
01:14:32.241 --> 01:14:36.170
It's a,
a guy in Singapore.
Have you been flossing lately?

1130
01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:41.360
You said that was conviction.
So I trust you to do look good,
but dude,

1131
01:14:41.361 --> 01:14:42.450
you should profess white

1132
01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:47.990
now that I know you've done it this to Singapore thinks that a,

1133
01:14:48.170 --> 01:14:52.130
a foreigner is taking too long at the ATM.

1134
01:14:52.450 --> 01:14:57.410
So he starts to uh,
verbally barrier.
It's pretty intense actually.

1135
01:14:57.411 --> 01:14:58.430
Really?
Yeah.

1136
01:14:58.770 --> 01:15:03.770
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

1137
01:15:15.610 --> 01:15:19.210
<v 7>whoa.
Wow.
I don't know.
I think of Singapore like that.</v>

1138
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:23.440
This guy has some,
yeah,
some NYC flair to him.

1139
01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:27.190
I do like it because he's saying what I think and he's saying what the other

1140
01:15:27.191 --> 01:15:30.580
people wanting to sit.
Right.
They don't,
they're not going to say it.
No,
that's it.

1141
01:15:30.581 --> 01:15:33.490
That's a difference.
It's called social return.
And by the way,

1142
01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:36.700
you ever been stuck at an ATM behind someone that doesn't know what the fuck's

1143
01:15:36.701 --> 01:15:37.390
going on.

1144
01:15:37.390 --> 01:15:40.240
And I've been the person that doesn't know what the final while we all have.

1145
01:15:40.241 --> 01:15:44.890
But it can be,
it can be nerve wracking when you keep hearing,
but you're like,

1146
01:15:44.891 --> 01:15:48.730
hey,
you were either withdrawn or you're depositing like one of the two.
Right.

1147
01:15:48.910 --> 01:15:53.170
What are you doing right now?
You'd be BP,
BP,
BP,
and now pick a lane asshole.

1148
01:15:58.910 --> 01:16:01.510
<v 2>Oh Shit.
Oh,</v>

1149
01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:07.313
nice.

1150
01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:13.130
<v 1>Turn it up.
Damn Dude.
Well,
he's right in Singapore.</v>

1151
01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:14.840
They got stricter rules on stuff.

1152
01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:18.440
Can't you can't take your time at the ATM,

1153
01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:22.780
<v 7>right?
Isn't that true?
Yeah,</v>

1154
01:16:23.470 --> 01:16:24.303
<v 2>it's good.</v>

1155
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:29.600
You go home.

1156
01:16:38.190 --> 01:16:39.023
Oh

1157
01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:49.110
<v 7>Wow.
Wow.
Wow.</v>

1158
01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:51.220
The climax here.
Ready?
I'm ready.

1159
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:55.380
<v 2>I know.</v>

1160
01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:04.733
Yes.

1161
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:11.950
Oh,

Gets out.

1162
01:17:15.190 --> 01:17:17.850
Oh Man.
How long do you want me gay.

1163
01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:24.370
<v 7>Wow.
That's uncomfortable,
right?
Yeah.</v>

1164
01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:29.650
I mean that's excessive.
Yeah.
Do you want to slap?
Yeah,
it's not cool.

1165
01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:34.330
It's pretty funny though.
Yeah.
He's uh,
he's worked up.
Mr Singapore is,

1166
01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:39.160

Oh yeah.

01:17:41.230 --> 01:17:42.070

1173
01:17:55.010 --> 01:17:57.860
<v 1>I like that accent.
Yeah.
There's a guy on Instagram.

1174
01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:01.550
He's Carlo malty still changing.
He's always talks like that.

1175
01:18:01.551 --> 01:18:06.230
He is from Singapore to look gay.

1176
01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:09.350

Oh,

it's not a Maltese.

1177
01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:13.730
So something else.
That's cute as fuck though.
What's the name?

That's how like your,
your friend's dad would describe it.
I love it.

1183

Fad Kid running North Korea.

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:45.330
But that's how our senator describes him on the news.

There's justice masterful.
Hi Mommy.

That was during.

1188
01:18:55.290 --> 01:18:57.690
Yes.
I've been thinking about it and it was like a hit.

1189
01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:02.040
That guy went back and doubled down on it.
Yeah.

1190

<v 1>Could you improve on something you want us,

1191
01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:07.440
it's pretty impressive as I saw it.

1192
01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:10.860
It's like your genes are already as tight as they can be and then you tighten

1193
01:19:10.861 --> 01:19:15.090
them.
It's an,

it's got to plug it in a project.

01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:12.190
Plus he's got somebody filling it.

01:21:00.530 --> 01:21:03.710
I've got orders for a couple of different people,
but it's on one ticket.

1223
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:04.723
Is that okay?

1228
01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:22.890
<v 14>Uh,

Let the conversation begins.
I'm going to start with the,
uh,</v>

1229
01:21:23.010 --> 01:21:27.540
the buffalo chicken tenders or the spicy chicken tenders.
Now,

1230
01:21:27.541 --> 01:21:29.770
do you have to in you or do you have three in

1231

1236
01:21:51.890 --> 01:21:55.590
Uh,
you know I'm going to have to do thousand ranch with that.
Yes.
Okay.

1237
01:21:55.730 --> 01:22:00.390
So then I'm looking here on the crevice of the menu.

1238
01:22:00.810 --> 01:22:03.960
The store down in the hundreds block has chips in a bowl.
Do you guys have that?

1239
01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:08.150
Jesus,

1240
01:22:08.151 --> 01:22:12.130
Do we have one chips in a bowl?
You guys don't have that.
Okay.

1241
01:22:12.490 --> 01:22:15.430
Probably don't have hot dogs and Gatorade either.
That's fine.
You know what,

1242
01:22:15.431 --> 01:22:19.000

1244
01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:25.390
It's like the original butter burger with cheese.

1245
01:22:26.890 --> 01:22:30.550
<v 11>Yeah,
