46
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:35.050
but it is my duty and my obligation and duty,

47
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.230
duty and obligation to remind you that your boy t has a brand new Netflix

48
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:45.160
special.

50
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.400
January the 12th,

51
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.350
<v 1>and</v>

<v 6>have a worldwide.

53
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.590
<v 5>Don't forget,
I get</v>

54
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.940
<v 6>to check it out and tell your friends,</v>

55
00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:06.360
tell your family what can people expect from this?
What can people expect?

56
00:04:06.361 --> 00:04:10.860
One of my favorite interview questions about a comedy show it,

57
00:04:10.861 --> 00:04:13.170
you can expect that I go for it.

58
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.770
Politics are going to be talking a lot of issues.
It's so funny.

59
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.990
[inaudible] they go,
um,
I hope you don't fuck up and do a bunch of Trump jokes.

60
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.580
Oh,
okay.
Right.
Cause that's what the year of the political comic or even like,

61
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.940
like,
but who are you to decide?
Like what's,

62
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.650
what's fucking up and what's not?
I mean like,
you know what I mean?

63
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.210
Like do you mean personally for you?
It would upset you.
Okay.

64
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.990
I hope you don't say anything that I take offense tail.
Like,
no,

65
00:04:39.991 --> 00:04:43.620
that's not what I do.
But like he was my favorite.
I already don't like you.

66
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.410
Just so you know,
I have a son.
Yes.
Send me the criteria on hair.

67
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.760
Tell me the,
that your personal criteria for what the special,
exactly.

68
00:04:53.761 --> 00:04:57.360
All the turns it should take and the topics it should tackle.

69
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.870
And then if they're like,
you know,
I was up,
I was up to you.

70
00:05:00.871 --> 00:05:03.710
I was with you up until this point.
That's what they tell you.
Oh,
I've,

71
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.090
I've gotten those.
I had a guy who was,
so,

72
00:05:06.091 --> 00:05:10.500
he loved my special until I made fun of Dick Clark and for him,

73
00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:14.640
Dick Clark was the gold standard and he was very upset with me and well then he

74
00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:18.720
liked a lot of it because that was the closing.
He was on board and then I,
I,

75
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.130
I lost him there.
So I,
I saw a lot of backlash for Chapelle,
you know,

76
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.940
so I haven't seen that too.
Then they're like,
you,
you know this top of,

77
00:05:26.941 --> 00:05:30.570
then they also,
some people were like,
you shouldn't have done Trump jokes.

78
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.010
It's like,
why?
Why shouldn't he do it?
He wants.
Yeah.
It's like,

79
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.020
what are you talking about,
man?
Yeah.
He didn't like ask you,

80
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.070
what do you want to see?

81
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.350
And then when against your wishes he's doing his own show.
Yeah.
Yeah.

82
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.340
And also too,
you know,
with a,

83
00:05:44.341 --> 00:05:47.970
I've been reading about the offense people have been taking,
not people,

84
00:05:47.971 --> 00:05:50.650
I should say,
I should say the writers,
the,
uh,

85
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.210
the PC people they're going after Chapelle.
Yeah.
And,

86
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.010
and my favorite I read an article is like,
you know,
he's unsympathetic

87
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.750
<v 3>to trans people and he should be more sympathetic to trans people of color.</v>

88
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:03.560
Like,

89
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.850
as if to imply the Dave Chappelle is not only responsible for one type of trans,

90
00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:12.410
but he should be thinking of the spectrum of all types of people with all types

91
00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:15.140
of gender identity and,
and colors.
And like,

92
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:17.160
he can't be responsible for all of it guys.

93
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.120
Like he's just a man with his point of view,
trying to make some jokes,
jokes.

94
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.950
That's,
that's,
that's his job.
He's responsible.

95
00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:28.400
He's responsible for going for jokes.
Yeah.
If he was like,

96
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:31.340
I'm not doing joke tonight,
and then you'd be like,
he's a very irresponsible,

97
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.120
right.

98
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.540
And he should be taking into account every person of color with a race and the

99
00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:38.690
gender and the thing,
and it's like,
dude,
get give the guy find a break.

100
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.140
He's a funny guy.
He's a good entertainer.
Maybe it's not for you.

101
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:46.220
That's another option.
Yeah.
I always like to remind people.
Yeah,
that's true.

102
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.130
Maybe I'm not for you.
Maybe other people are not for you,

103
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.120
but there are a lot of options,
right?
Yeah.
How about that?

104
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.080
It's one of my favorite ones to say to people who write to me about Netflix when

105
00:06:57.081 --> 00:07:01.370
they're like,
I didn't like this part of your necklace thing.
I always write back.

106
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.620
I wish they had other shows you can watch.
Right.
The catalog.

107
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:11.300
Just thousands of them without a sea of them.
But no,
I'm,

108
00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:14.870
I'm actually,
I'm very much looking forward to it coming out.

109
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.380
I'm looking forward to everyone is a fun,
it was a fun tour.

110
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.340
This is a snapshot of like one of the best nights of the tour,

111
00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:24.290
so I think it's going to be a fun special.

112
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.250
It was super funny when you recorded it.
I was there for that.
You look great.

113
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.330
Sounded Great.
I think the material is outstanding.
I think people are,

114
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.100
your fans are going to be very happy with this one.
I hope so.
It's a big deal.

115
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.660
I'll get off social media that day now.
I don't even come on.

116
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:46.520
You know I've read about some big actors.
They go to other countries.

117
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.240
Aren't you telling me that?
No.
I would tell you that ugly guy from star wars,

118
00:07:50.241 --> 00:07:54.350
the one who plays?
Yeah,
he was on girls.

119
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.070
Oh,
that ugly guy.
Ugly.
By the way,

120
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.350
I don't know what it is about the star wars casting because we just saw the

121
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:07.390
latest installment and everybody's fucking dog city dog chow.

122
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.110
I don't know why.
Why they can't cast attractive actors to play.
Oh,

123
00:08:12.111 --> 00:08:16.590
I know the leads.
I mean everybody's a fucking Bowzer on.
It's a dog pound would,

124
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.900
oh,
it's a bunch of dogs on there.
And then this actually,

125
00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:24.950
that guy from girls,
Adam driver,
his name,
he is so ugly.

126
00:08:24.951 --> 00:08:29.180
I don't even know why this is a leading man now.
He looks good there.
There,

127
00:08:29.181 --> 00:08:33.860
that's a good photo.
But I mean,
look,
I'm not,
I personally,

128
00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:37.130
I don't find him sexually attracted.
Maybe some women do,

129
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.710
but I feel like he's not very traditionally at some what's,

130
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.470
let's say that we're traditionalist.

131
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.810
We want you to be handsome the way we want it to be.
Handsome.

132
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:49.100
He looks good there though.
That's upsetting.
That's like a good photo of him.

133
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:53.330
He looks like a young Keanu there.
I don't disagree.
No,

134
00:08:53.331 --> 00:08:55.980
but in the movie you're just like,
is there a way,
can you

135
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.210
<v 6>put your mask back on?</v>

136
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.490
That's what I want them to do because that guys like tag that re-discuss

137
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.790
ridiculous helmet.
I'm like,
have I put that shit back on?

138
00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:08.160
Paint more of those black scars on your face.
Like the stitching?
Yeah.

139
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.760
He looked cooler.
What the scars on his face.
I thought,
yeah,
I don't know.

140
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.630
I was like,
anyway.
Um,
and no spoiler,

141
00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:18.090
I'm not going to spoil or alert or any or whatever.

142
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:20.600
The word is you run the plot platform.
They,

143
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.030
Luke Skywalker does make an appearance.
Okay.
And we know that he was,

144
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:28.860
he goes to the island of the gurus or wherever he's from,
CIF for Far Island,

145
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:34.320
Ofac,
Rutgers,
uh,
now,
uh,
annoying to us as viewers.

146
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:38.190
They don't address the biggest issue,
which is how does he masturbate?

147
00:09:38.191 --> 00:09:42.580
Because there's no internet connection.
There's no masturbation.
And there's also,

148
00:09:42.581 --> 00:09:44.190
it's like there's all this high tech shit,

149
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.370
but he's not watching any porn or asking for porn.

150
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:51.150
Like even when he runs into another person,
he's like,
he's not like,

151
00:09:51.151 --> 00:09:54.130
did you bring any porn with you?
So stupid.
Well,

152
00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.980
and he's been there for so many years in there,
a long time.

153
00:09:56.981 --> 00:10:00.810
It doesn't try to fuck,
he's not like,
what's up with your tits?
Like,
well,

154
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.310
there's no other humans there.

155
00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:05.370
There's only reach runs into a human at some point and he's not like,

156
00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:09.060
here you down.
Right.
That's fine.
Weird.
It's weird.

157
00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:10.910
And he lives in like a brick hut.
So we,

158
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.220
we didn't get to see how he shits or where he shits switch.

159
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.580
I think that's the first question.
No bathroom breaks in any part of the movie.

160
00:10:17.581 --> 00:10:21.840
There's aliens and people coexisting.
No one's like,
I got to go to the bathroom.

161
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:27.150
No one says I'm horny.
I want to jerk off.
No one tries to fuck anybody.

162
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.760
I,
nobody eats ever in these films,
which makes me crazy.
Like,

163
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.200
which I guess is the explanation for why they're not going to the bathroom.

164
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.720
But yeah,
it's really stupid.

165
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:41.280
Like George Lucas has a real fucking hole in this thing.
Major,

166
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:42.990
major plot holes.

167
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:47.160
Maybe they eat like military Mras that block them up.
You know,

168
00:10:47.161 --> 00:10:50.810
like they're high calories.
That scene.
Where is this?
He,
yeah.

169
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.080
Where's that scene?
I mean,
they're the space ships and things.

170
00:10:55.081 --> 00:10:59.600
Not like you see a spaceship where there's like a wookie.
Um,

171
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.070
where does he shit?
A couple humans,

172
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:07.020
another alien and no one's like,
hey,
we're up in the space ship right now.

173
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:11.070
Do you guys want to have an orgy?
Or like,
does anyone got a shit?

174
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:12.721
Well,

175
00:11:12.721 --> 00:11:16.620
you'd think the wookie would take lucky size downstream would be horrendous.

176
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:18.900
And they'd be like,
get Outta here.
You know?

177
00:11:18.901 --> 00:11:22.260
And they forced him the shit out of the side of the spaceship.

178
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.260
What is Chewbacca eat like?
They don't,
doesn't show him eating.

179
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.720
It doesn't show him,
by the way,
trying to fuck any women.

180
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:31.890
Which a Wiki you would look at and be like,
that's going well.

181
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.800
And it's annoying because he and c three Po or no,

182
00:11:35.801 --> 00:11:39.480
R Two d two they both say the same phrases.
Oh Wow.

183
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.220
And then the other human understands it.
You're always,
oh,

184
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.080
you mean you want to go outside?
Chewy?
Yeah,

185
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.000
that sounded exactly the same as everything he's been saying for 20 years.

186
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.660
Maybe it's like Japanese,
you know,
they just granted a lot and you're like,

187
00:11:51.661 --> 00:11:56.660
well that's a totally different phrase.
Yeah.
Japanese.

188
00:11:56.661 --> 00:11:59.110
You're like,
that's the same thing.
You could just say sure.
Or Mandarin.

189
00:11:59.111 --> 00:12:03.370
They're like,
she's bright.
And you're like,
okay,
what does that mean?

190
00:12:03.371 --> 00:12:05.710
And they're like,
right,
that means we have lunch in 17 minutes.

191
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:10.060
And then you're like,
all right.
And then
you're like,
wait,
I know I heard you.

192
00:12:10.061 --> 00:12:13.870
It's like,
no,
now I just said that the,
the car downstairs,

193
00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:16.990
the tires are flat and you're like,
wait,
you just said 17 minutes ago.

194
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:21.940
So you're equating the wookie language with Mandarin or the R Two d two language

195
00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:26.410
with,
with uh,
one of the oldest languages on the planet know

196
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.930
there's a lot of switching.
Sure,
sure.
Interesting know.

197
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:39.510
Do you think George Lucas studied Japanese and then wrote the language?
Well,

198
00:12:39.511 --> 00:12:44.360
I was not doing Japanese,
Japanese one.
Oh,
I'm sorry.
I,
my ear is not as tuned.

199
00:12:44.361 --> 00:12:49.150
Does yours,
do you think there are people out there like,
you know,

200
00:12:49.151 --> 00:12:50.620
how people learn cling on?

201
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.630
Do you think there are people that learn to speak Chewbacca language like their

202
00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.770
schools?
Yeah,
yeah,
of course.
And,

203
00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.950
and the c three Po language or whatever.

204
00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:05.060
Rtr People so dedicated to virginity being nerds.

205
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:10.500
Yeah.
It's like,
yeah,
there's definitely that three Po.

206
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.680
I know.
It's one of the dumbest thing.
I think that happens,
you know,

207
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.640
but it's not,

208
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:23.040
I don't think it's fair to equate a Chinese or Japanese with the Wiki language,

209
00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:28.240
uh,
Marcy three.
But I think that's pretty tricky to keep mixing them up.

210
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:32.440
R Two d two is the tiny one.
C three Po is the the goal uptight.
Yeah.

211
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:37.030
The no fun broke robot.
Yeah.
He's the gay robot.
Yeah.
He's totally gay.
Right?

212
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:42.130
Oh,
monster.
Luke.
Yeah.
He's,
he's very much like,
he picks him always going like,

213
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:44.050
oh yeah,
he's Fay.
Yeah.

214
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.440
Do you think so you think George Lucas wrote him is like the gay,

215
00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.350
definitely a robot.
Speaking of accents and difficult to undo,

216
00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.070
<v 7>ladies and gentlemen,
Tom Segura,</v>

217
00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:02.940
master of,
so
let me tell you,

218
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.280
<v 6>title has slipped off so much in the last couple of years.</v>

219
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.740
What do you got to remind people?
First of all,

220
00:14:10.741 --> 00:14:12.630
the open and clip was that my Stepdad,

221
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.440
people thought it was your Stepdad and they wanted to know if that's what it

222
00:14:16.441 --> 00:14:19.320
sounded like when you were growing up.
Yes.
For people that don't know,

223
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.000
Christina grew up with an Indian stepdad.
That's not just an amazing reference.

224
00:14:23.001 --> 00:14:25.380
Yeah.
And three Indian step.
So true.

225
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:29.520
And we ate a lot of curry and he talked lie shit.
Yeah.

226
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.320
Is that what it sounded like?
Let's go back.
No,
he didn't have a thick accent.

227
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.020
That the folder,
it says Christina stuff that arguing Chella yeah.

228
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:40.260
<v 5>If you want those little go down.
Yeah,</v>

229
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.410
you're fucking not fucking,
you are fucking fucking fucking

230
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:48.683
bitch.

231
00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.060
<v 6>I Love,
love this style of arguing.
Yeah.</v>

232
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:57.870
Cause I think there's a chance that they both speak the same language and

233
00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:58.430
they're,

234
00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.970
they're refusing to get into choosing English yet and choosing the words.

235
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:06.470
The only words they know,
which is fucking fuck you bloody.

236
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:10.370
So we obviously live in the UK.
Yeah.
And uh,
look out in the,

237
00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.340
a real anger is kind of scary,
right.
To be angry.

238
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:17.300
My stepdad used to get into altercations with strangers like this too.

239
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.250
You didn't speak like this,
right?
Not this.
No.
No.
He spoke really good English.

240
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.960
He was from Bombay,
formerly Mumbai.
Could you hear the Indian accent?

241
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:28.700
Every now and then it would come out,

242
00:15:28.701 --> 00:15:32.660
but it was not thick cause he came to the u s when he was like 28 years old.

243
00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.250
It was pretty late.
I know,
but,

244
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.370
but you forget that they were taught English because you know the British took

245
00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:42.350
over India.
So I'm assuming he learned English early in life.
Oh,
okay.

246
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.640
But yeah,
sometimes it would come out.
Who fucking knew he did that?

247
00:15:46.641 --> 00:15:51.350
A lot of other fucker.
Ooh,
fuck dude.
Fucking guy.
Like that's how he's,

248
00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:54.240
Oh fucking killed a guy.
Like he,

249
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.670
he actually sounded more like Midwestern.
I wasn't sometimes it was weird.

250
00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:02.780
Your stories about him or absolutely terrifying.
I know he's dead now,
thankfully.

251
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.630
Yeah.
But he was a special,
yeah,
he was different.

252
00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:09.500
But I mean maybe it's Indian guys,
they get really upset.
I think it's,

253
00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:14.840
I do think it is cultural for Indians to become more animated and to use the

254
00:16:14.841 --> 00:16:19.220
hand.
He did a lot of the hand gesturing that you see in the movies,
you know,

255
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.150
and the head bottling stuff he did that.

256
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:27.590
He was more this a gesture or what appears to be happening is the argument is

257
00:16:27.591 --> 00:16:32.591
between the guy who's walking and the guy who was driving and the driver is the

258
00:16:33.021 --> 00:16:33.854
one with the camera.

259
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.450
He seems more agitated because see this guy is like trying to tell him something

260
00:16:38.451 --> 00:16:41.510
that Walker is.
Yeah.
And then the driver is like,

261
00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.870
<v 5>if you want to go,
then you'll go to Zillow.
Go down.
Yes.
He would just grab it.</v>

262
00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.960
<v 6>See,
that's the reason it are you crazy.
That's really a lot of people's,</v>

263
00:16:49.961 --> 00:16:53.800
a set off point.
If you,
if you ask a crazy person,
are you crazy?
Yeah.

264
00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:57.700
That's when they lose it.
Yeah.
You know,
you can't ask crazy.
Are you crazy?

265
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.050
Or you're telling him you're crazy.
Then they snap.
That's like the end of it,
man.

266
00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:03.723
Yeah.

267
00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:08.200
<v 5>I got no fucking,
you are fucking fucking</v>

268
00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.980
bitch.
Fuck you.
Fuck you fucking fuck you.

269
00:17:16.981 --> 00:17:21.450
Bloody fucking fuck you.
Fuck you.

270
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:27.190
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Fuck Bitch.
Fuck you.

271
00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.640
Bloody bastard.
Have a bent toward blarney backed up.

272
00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.450
Know Black Duck.

273
00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:39.000
You know about.
That's uh,
that's almost like he reverted back to his,

274
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.660
his actual native tongue.
I don't know.
It was like,
fuck you.
Fuck you bitch.

275

We used to,

285
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.000
I don't know if I told us one,
but we,
one time we stopped for p,

286
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.160
he used to love pistachio ice cream and we'd go get it Thrifty's which is the

287
00:18:33.161 --> 00:18:37.720

One time we were go,

288
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:41.110

We get in the car.
He goes,
hold on,
I got to do something.

289
00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.770
Gets out of the car,
stabs at guy's tire,
gets back into the car.

290
00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.670
We get pistachio ice cream and at the time I,

291
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:50.740
my mom was in the car and I was like,
did he just stabbed?
That guy is tired.

292
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:55.090
And My mother was just laughing and she was like,
well,

293
00:18:55.091 --> 00:18:58.660
That's all they had to show him this mother fucker.
I was like,
whoa.

294
00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:01.450
There's some guy that he had done business with that.

295
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:04.640
How old were you in our law and set on fire once?
Uh,

296
00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:08.290
he had his windshield shot out on the freeway by somebody.

297
00:19:08.291 --> 00:19:10.330
He had done business with.
God.

298
00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.750
It's different,
man.
Didn't pay taxes for like a decade.
That'll do it.
That's good.

299
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:24.130
<v 5>Wow.

303
00:19:34.381 --> 00:19:38.420
And like running like a lady in it because this guy's jogging I guess on the

304
00:19:38.421 --> 00:19:41.270
side of the road.
As she's telling him.
He's telling me I'm a woman.

305
00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:44.780
I love foreigners cussing people out.

315
00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:24.340
Because I even going through the [inaudible] due to other places we got of this

316
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.590

I don't know.
You have to like this.
I think you have to go,

317
00:20:27.591 --> 00:20:30.200
go into accident.
No,

Not me.

Good man.

318
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.690
<v 3>Salting at me.
Yeah.
Salt assaulting me.
Yeah.
Oh,</v>

319
00:20:33.691 --> 00:20:37.440

Yeah.
Yeah.

320
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.830
So great.
It's a great argument.
Yeah.

321
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.720
I think I like a foreign foreign arguments more than I like white trash

322
00:20:45.721 --> 00:20:47.960
arguments.
So we play.
Yeah.
You know,
like

323
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.220
<v 6>trashy white people.
I don't know.
This is more,
can be good.</v>

324
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.440
It's fun like this because it's,
you know what?

325
00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:56.890
There you can try to guess what they're trying to say and they're saying it kind

326
00:20:56.891 --> 00:21:00.610
of wrong.
Wow.
Fuck me.
I you,
why you fucked me.
I fuck you.

327
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:05.110
Yeah.
To see what he's really trying to say there is,

328
00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:10.330
why are you saying fuck you to me?
Yeah.
Fuck fuck you.
Yeah.
He said,

329
00:21:10.331 --> 00:21:13.090
why you fucked me?
I fucked.
Yes,
it's fantastic.
That's a great way.

330
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:15.110
Imagine how hard it is.
Fuck me.

331
00:21:15.111 --> 00:21:19.210
I've talked to Florida to get a good swear on in a,
in a second language.

332
00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:20.530
It's damn near impossible.

333
00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.920
But I did for you bloody.
Cause they also,

334
00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:30.520
you know the Brits lots of bloody bloody that.
Yeah.
Oh my God.

335
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:34.540
That's tough.
It's tough to get a perfect sweater.
You bloody bastard.

336
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:38.050
I've heard the joke before.
I don't know whose it is,
but like when you're scared,

337
00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.490
you always go to your native tongue.
Oh,
that's interesting.
No,

338
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.950
I forget who did it so I can't,
but I heard somebody say that and I was like,

339
00:21:44.951 --> 00:21:46.060
that is absolutely true.
Like

340
00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.270
<v 2>be,
uh,</v>

341
00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:53.330
speaking Spanish in Latin America and fully be rapping with people,

342
00:21:54.181 --> 00:21:56.240
but like if somebody pulls out a gun,
I'm gonna

343
00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:01.010
<v 6>oh shit.
You know,
you don't,
you don't stay in the second tongue.
Of course.</v>

344
00:22:01.011 --> 00:22:03.340
You always go to your native tongue when you're in fear.
Well,

345
00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:07.700
I wonder what my parents dreamed in what language.
I think eventually,

346
00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.240
eventually it changes to English.
Yeah.

347
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.480
Eventually it changes to the what you're immersed in.
That's interesting.

348
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:17.900
Like you could probably have like I remember when I studied abroad,

349
00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:22.340
I was dreaming English,
English,
but like three,
four months in it switched over.

350
00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:26.060
Yeah.
Because it was all day every day.
That's crazy.
No,

351
00:22:26.061 --> 00:22:29.030
nobody was speaking English so that's crazy.

352
00:22:29.031 --> 00:22:31.430
You're just speaking Mexican all day long.
All Day Mexican.
Yeah.

353
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:35.930
My favorite story is your Senora that you lived with

354
00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:40.640
and come down for breakfast.

355
00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.540
Tell your story now.
I would to,
I would go to a

356
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.640
<v 2>breakfast every day.
Uh,</v>

357
00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:52.410
I lived with an old lady I sent you are extending rights at us like you call

358
00:22:52.411 --> 00:22:55.020
your mom.
She was like late seventies early eighties,

359
00:22:56.310 --> 00:23:00.840
three American white boys and the other two had been there for a while before
me,

360
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.970
so they were doing two semesters.
I was only one.

361
00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:07.830
So they did a full semester already.
So I got there and like,

362
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:13.140
I dunno,
it's like over a month into me being there already and we have,

363
00:23:13.141 --> 00:23:16.890
we have breakfast and lunch together most days,
sometimes dinner.

364
00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:22.350
Um,
but breakfast every day.
So I come out and I was like,
oh,
I'm going to,

365
00:23:22.351 --> 00:23:22.980
uh,

366
00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:27.480
I forget what city I'm going to like the leather or Toledo.

367
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:32.400
Yeah.
Or like Galeazzi or something this weekend to visit a friend's family.

368
00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:36.240
And she's like,
oh,
that's nice.
And I go,
yeah.
She goes,

369
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.310
will you wear underwear to breakfast there too?

370
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:45.650
<v 6>Because every day I would do,
what I always do is like,</v>

371
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:48.620
I've just come out of my boxes,
which,
which is what you do at home,

372
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:52.010
right in front of the nanny had thought about it and she never said anything.

373
00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:56.900
Yeah.
But she said it then I go and I'd right away I go,
oh,
I'm sorry.
I go,

374
00:23:56.901 --> 00:23:57.734
I didn't know.

375
00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:02.670
So from then on I always put on like sweat pants or shorts over my boxes.
Yeah.

376
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:06.410
But that was her way of letting me know.
Instead of saying something,
she's like,

377
00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:08.450
well,
you wear your underwear to breakfast there too.

378
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.310
You rude American pig.
Yeah.
She was like,
Jesus,
man,

379
00:24:13.311 --> 00:24:16.130
you're nuts are out at breakfast.
One morning.
I was like,
still do that.

380
00:24:16.131 --> 00:24:19.100
It's like you're 80 you don't like it at all.
Of course.
You like it.

381
00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:23.580
You do feel more comfortable in your mind.
I want to live in my boxers.
Yeah.

382
00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:28.060
I love walking around in my boxers.
I bet.
Yeah,
I bet.
That's nice.

383
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:31.700
I don't feel like women should have boxers too.
Yeah.
Yeah.

384
00:24:31.701 --> 00:24:34.730
How come you guys get to have these like awesome shorts?

385
00:24:34.731 --> 00:24:38.450
Basically you were on new year's stuff and then we have to wear like tight stuff

386
00:24:38.451 --> 00:24:43.451
around our coaches and the truth is our genital suffer more by being seized up

387
00:24:44.511 --> 00:24:48.380
like that are sealed in.
You want them to be able to breathe?
Yeah,

388
00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.010
please.
You must.
It was my mother's big one.

389
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:55.370
You must let your vagina breathe at night.

390
00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:59.390
Don't wear underwear when you get home,

391
00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:03.050
you take off your underwear is sleep.

392
00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.380
She just pluralized things and critically all the time.
Mom,
this too.
Yeah.

393
00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.370
It's hard.
English is too complicated.
It's not an easy language.

394
00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:14.760
There's words like a comb.
Yeah.
Comb Houmas.

395
00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:19.700
CONB is bom B two mom and comb.

396
00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:24.410
Right,
right.
So it's not gone.
He's gone home.

397
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:28.340
Yeah.
Just say whatever.
After you hear it,
you're like,
yeah,

398
00:25:28.341 --> 00:25:31.460
that is kind of dumb that it sounds different.

399
00:25:31.461 --> 00:25:35.120
This spelled the basically the same.
Yeah.
There's a lot of exceptions to rules.

400
00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:39.760
It's really not an easy language to learn.
She still uses the wrong pronouns.
Yes.

401
00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:44.810
Yeah.
She speaks pretty great though.
Be great considering like she'll say like,

402
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:46.450
I mean she's not a nonbinary,

403
00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:51.320
but she'll refer it to like you as he and Mia.
She and I'm just like,

404
00:25:51.321 --> 00:25:54.470
whatever.
Yeah,
let it go,
but it doesn't bother me.
It doesn't bother me.

405
00:25:54.471 --> 00:25:59.390
I'm just like,
you still don't get it right.
Like 39 years.
40 some years in,

406
00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:04.100
I guess.
I imagine like,
I don't know.
I guess it's so hard.
It is hard.

407
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:07.590
It is hard.
Well,
here,
this is the master of accidents I was trying to get to.
Oh,

408
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.460
okay.
Maybe you can weigh in since you're such a bragger now

409
00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.410
<v 8>fraud and first fuck you.</v>

410
00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.980
Nice noise on a hot day.

411
00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:26.800
He's an alcoholic.
I think so.
Yeah.

412
00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:28.190
Fucking dog couch.

413
00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:35.560
<v 6>VB.
It's,
I bet he says it's a cheap beer.
Right?
I can see the label.</v>

414
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:40.450
The label starts with a v Victorian Beers.
Yeah.
So let's see what Sir

415
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:43.350
<v 8>fucking Doug Carter first fuck is</v>

416
00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:46.420
<v 3>for harder and thirst fuckers.</v>

417
00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.040
<v 2>It's either that he's either saying that name or saying it fuckers.</v>

418
00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:55.250
<v 3>Nah,
I can't really tell the hardened thirst fuckers.
Yeah,</v>

419
00:26:57.410 --> 00:27:01.710
dog.
Cause I like dog cons.
I've never heard dog content.
Never heard that before.

420
00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:06.290
Really good dog comes.
Yeah,
it's really good.
I mean I have that.

421
00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:09.240
Is that so intense fucking dog of,

422
00:27:09.241 --> 00:27:13.070
I mean we've heard comments like the British say Khan Khan,
kind of a dog.
Cons.

423
00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:17.720
Wow.
How does a good one,
I bet this guy is a real pig to women too.

424
00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:19.490
Yeah,
I mean God,

425
00:27:19.491 --> 00:27:22.850
can you imagine his me to list how long that shit is?

426
00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:27.950
Hashtag dog kind of Scott is a savage peg for sure.

427
00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:30.213
<v 8>Don't cut.</v>

428
00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:36.800
<v 3>Nice.
Nice.
I know.
Hot Dry on this bit there.
Oh,</v>

429
00:27:36.801 --> 00:27:38.170
Victoria bitter VB.

430
00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:42.600
<v 2>Oh,
that's what he says.
So that bitter taste nice on a hot day.</v>

431
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:45.570
It's probably a better,
so does he say,

432
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:51.620
<v 3>ah,
yeah.
Fuck her dog.
VB fucking dog.</v>

433
00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:54.190
But at the beginning here,
that's the only question it does he say

434
00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:59.300
<v 2>mother fucker or does he say,
uh,
betters this part here?</v>

435
00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.460
<v 8>I didn't fish.
Fuck you.</v>

436
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:07.280
<v 3>Fuck is.
Oh yeah,

Yeah.
Fuck is he Australian?
Yeah.</v>

437
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:11.620
Yeah.
For Hot and thirst.
Fuck you's.
Yeah.
Saying fuck you.
Okay.

438
00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:12.970
He's not saying it better.
I think.

439
00:28:12.971 --> 00:28:16.900
I bet you Victoria bitters is like a ghetto ass brand or something

440
00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.870
<v 8>first.
Fuck you.
Don't come</v>

441
00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:24.740
<v 2>Doug.
Correct
guys.
Terry,</v>

442
00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:29.520
I wish I would not be surprised if they're like,
hey,
guess what?

443
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:32.150
This turns out this guy has a dungeon and it's out.

444
00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:35.300
Of course he knows that there's been girls tied up there for years.
Yeah,
yeah.

445
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:38.100
He's,
yeah.
Yeah.
He's like,

446
00:28:38.101 --> 00:28:42.510
don't let any drip drop fall out of your mouth.
I'll cut your nipples off.

447
00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.740
He's also got,
yeah,

448
00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:47.310
<v 3>that hard booze bag.
Look where he's really pale,</v>

449
00:28:47.311 --> 00:28:49.020
but he turns red easily.

450
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:52.280
<v 2>This is decades consumption.
Decades.</v>

451
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:54.460
Lifetime of alcohol.

452
00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.600
<v 3>Is he here?
I mean,</v>

453
00:28:57.601 --> 00:29:01.950
you've pointed this out a lot and now I'm starting to notice how people age.

454
00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:03.810
Yeah.
Not so much that they age,

455
00:29:03.811 --> 00:29:07.230
but it's in the how and you can really see how people have been living it

456
00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:12.330
totally dependent upon like if do they look like this is their skin red
leathery?

457
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.090
Yeah.
They look like they've been drinking their whole lives.

458
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.520
Do they have the distended hard belly?

459
00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:19.730
<v 2>Oh,
this guy is on his lap.
I mean this guy is going to,</v>

460
00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:23.330
he's going to have a painful death,
you know?
Seriously.

461
00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:27.770
I mean his insides are just going to melt.
It's probably got,
yeah.
Uh,

462
00:29:27.771 --> 00:29:29.060
I give him about four years.

463
00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:34.710
<v 3>Yeah.
10,
10 bad years for good ones.
Six shitty ones on the way out.</v>

464
00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:39.240
That's fair.
You can also just see like who's avoid advice.
That's all it is,

465
00:29:39.241 --> 00:29:42.220
is like have you been moderate in your life or have you been,

466
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:46.030
<v 6>but then you have to go riding it hard.
Do you,
what?
What is joy?
Do you,</v>

467
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:50.030
what brings you joy is for me seriously just drinking wine ain't no,

468
00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:53.510
but I'm saying for some people that vice is life.
Right,
right,
right.

469
00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:58.660
Speaking of that,
you just came back on it.
Yeah.
That was with the vice champion.

470
00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:03.820
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

471
00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:08.080
<v 2>To uh,
Atlanta for the national championship game,
by the way,</v>

472
00:30:08.081 --> 00:30:12.520
for those who followed a,
our weight loss.
And I remember Ari,

473
00:30:12.521 --> 00:30:16.810
the Welcher for not paying his bet,
he more than made up for it.
He flew us out,

474
00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:22.090
he put us up and he got unbelievable 50 yard line tickets,

475
00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:26.350
like 20 rows up to the national championship game,
which if you did not see it,

476
00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.500
you may have heard about it.
If you don't follow football,

477
00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:33.880
it was hands down one of the best games ever.
One.

478
00:30:33.881 --> 00:30:37.330
And certainly one of the best national championship games ever.
I mean,

479
00:30:37.331 --> 00:30:39.970
we've had some good ones,
so we've had some great ones,

480
00:30:39.971 --> 00:30:42.790
but that is right up there.
It went into overtime.

481
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:47.200
There was a comeback when we just had a blast.
We had so much fun.

482
00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:51.250
I flew in on Saturday.
I went to dinner with the guys.

483
00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.870
Uh,
Sunday we went,
we played,
uh,
top golf,
which is like this,

484
00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:00.430
this thing has really exploded where you go and you get like a little bay and

485
00:31:00.431 --> 00:31:02.260
you can hit,
you play games,

486
00:31:02.261 --> 00:31:05.830
but you hit golf balls into an open driving range,

487
00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.880
but from little bays and you order food and drinks and,

488
00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.030
<v 6>Oh,
speaking of drinks.</v>

489
00:31:10.031 --> 00:31:15.031
So you got to watch Burt drank for two or three days prior day.

490
00:31:16.421 --> 00:31:19.120
So did you keep track?
So we started Saturday night,

491
00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.430
<v 2>we went out to dinner,</v>

492
00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:25.520
we all had a few drinks and then we went back to the,

493
00:31:25.651 --> 00:31:28.260
uh,
you got an airbnb and we chilled there.

494
00:31:28.261 --> 00:31:32.850
And then the next day we went to,
oh,
we went to brunch.

495
00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.150
They really wanted to do a,
like a southern brunch.
That's fun.

496
00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:39.620
So I started with Mimosas and um,
you know,
not,

497
00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:42.300
I'm Burt had like three or four and uh,

498
00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:46.320
I think Ari and I had one or two and then we go to top golf.

499
00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:51.330
And so we,
we go there and he's just like,
I told Tito's and Soda,
Oh,

500
00:31:51.331 --> 00:31:56.250
pretty pick up through mine and then starts just doing that.
I'm actually like,

501
00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.530
I had a few drinks last night.
I'm a lightweight,
I go,

502
00:31:58.531 --> 00:32:01.250
I just need to rehydrate it.
So I'm just drinking water,
water,
water,

503
00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:03.360
water wasn't the water God.
So okay.

504
00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:06.330
So I'm doing that Ariz having bloody Mary's,

505
00:32:06.331 --> 00:32:10.780
but he's having like one for every two doubles that has.

506
00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.520
And by the way,
Burt's killing it.
He has a great golf swing.

507
00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:19.330
So he's just like playing well so he has,
I dunno,

508
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:20.550
we estimate.
He was like,

509
00:32:20.551 --> 00:32:25.290
I think I look five where like I think you had like seven and we settled on six,

510
00:32:25.291 --> 00:32:29.400
which is being generous.
This is on Golf Day?
Yes.

511
00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:34.680
So we leave there and then we go home,
have a drink at the house.

512
00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:38.310
So He's another one there.
Then we go to a cigar lounge before dinner.

513
00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.100
He has more doubles at

514
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.070
<v 6>the Cigar Lounge.
Doubles Question Tom,</v>

515
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:46.550
you were saying that birds drinking six drinks but he's drinking doubles.

516
00:32:46.551 --> 00:32:51.200
Correct.
At each drink.
Right.
So it's actually 12 drinks when you're saying six.

517
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:55.880
Yeah.
So,
so have you have the,
let's say the Momos is,
let's not even count them.

518
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:58.870
What's this to say?
That just orange juice?
Yeah.

519
00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.700
So six levels at top golf.

520
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:06.070
We go over to the house.
He has another Craig there.

521
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:09.650
So that's seven k two more at the Cigar Lounge.

522
00:33:09.651 --> 00:33:13.940
That's nine one at dinner.
Okay.

523
00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:18.920
<v 2>Uh,
one after dinner with the staff.
Um,</v>

524
00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:24.210
he has a shot where the chaser and then one last one.
So that's cash.

525
00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:27.490
It's an additional one,
two,
three,
four.
So that's what,

526
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.530
<v 6>well,
let's add it up.
I'm not really good at math.</v>

527
00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.210
It's 13,
13 and six.
It's 19,

528
00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:40.370
<v 2>so,
but times two because those are doubles.
They're all doubles.</v>

529
00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:43.730
30?
Yeah.
Say like 38 drinks.

530
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.300
Wow.

531
00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.330
<v 6>Do you want know how to maniac here?
So it's a lot,
dude.</v>

532
00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:57.630
I made a dinner reservation.
I fucked up.
She's,
I thought it was for later.

533
00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:02.220
So when I,
when I screwed up,
we had to like figure out where to drink until,
well,

534
00:34:02.221 --> 00:34:04.680
no,
we're going to get dinner because it's Sunday night.
We're like shit.

535
00:34:04.681 --> 00:34:06.360
And every place I look up,
it's closed.

536
00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:10.380
So we finally find there's a Ruth's Chris aware,
Ruth's Chris,

537
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:13.590
Chris Ruth's Chrysalis.
Carl's Jr.

538
00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:14.463
<v 2>There's risk,
Chris.</v>

539
00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:20.300
We go there and he's,
when he,
uh,
he goes to the bathroom,

540
00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:23.710
when he comes back,
he's like,
I don't know,
he's a little,
I'm gonna try the bread,

541
00:34:23.711 --> 00:34:25.360
man,
it's hot.
He was like,
okay.

542
00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:29.980
And then the whole like five people from the staff come back and they're like,

543
00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:34.990
oh my God.
He got recognized and told them,
Hey,
wait like two minutes,

544
00:34:34.991 --> 00:34:39.730
then come back and recognize me in front of them.
So they're like,

545
00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.780
Bird,
oh my God,
we're such big fans.
Okay.

546
00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:45.040
But then they were like talking about your mom's house.

547
00:34:45.041 --> 00:34:46.370
They like odd personality jam.
What?

548
00:34:46.371 --> 00:34:49.660
Like they're all just fans of podcasts and standup.

549
00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:54.220
But he had them come back and like act like they were,
they recognized us.

550
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:57.810
It's so weird.
Holy Shit.
Um,
and then we hung out with like,

551
00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:01.780
he was like hanging out with the staff and I'm like,
what are you doing?

552
00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:06.250
And he's like,
this is this the best.
I was like,
if you do this after every show,

553
00:35:06.251 --> 00:35:10.150
he's like,
yeah,
just sits there and shuts it down.
Just keeps drinking and

554
00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:14.110
<v 6>well,
that's what it is.
Maybe it's the drinks that keep flowing past closing.</v>

555
00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.320
Yeah.
He just likes to keep the party going.
He's a lot of fun.

556
00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.940
When we went to the game,

557
00:35:18.941 --> 00:35:22.600
we got stuck in line outside and he turned that into like a party,

558
00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:26.650
just like yell and Shit to people.
One guy was yelling at him like,
fuck you man,

559
00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:30.820
because we skipped a bunch of people.
And uh,

560
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:35.400
because of your ticketing or you just were just,
no,
we were jerks.
I paid,
uh,

561
00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:38.010
I paid a guy a smart,
yeah,
but

562
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.150
<v 2>we couldn't get up that far,</v>

563
00:35:39.151 --> 00:35:44.100
but we did get to skip a bunch of people and this guy was really pissed.

564
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:46.950
Him and his dad,
he was probably,
I don't know,

565
00:35:46.951 --> 00:35:51.540
late twenties and his dad was late fifties and he's a little guy and he was
like,

566
00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:53.580
mother Fucker,
get the fucking line,

567
00:35:53.581 --> 00:35:58.350
like really get really aggressive and bursts like,
dude,
we're on television.

568
00:35:58.351 --> 00:35:59.490
We have to get in there to work.

569
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:04.530
And like making it seem like we're with the production crew.
And uh,

570
00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.590
when we didn't get any further,
the guy's like,
what happened?
Your television?

571
00:36:07.591 --> 00:36:12.060
And he's like,
dude,
Google me,
I'm on TV.
And the guy goes,

572
00:36:12.061 --> 00:36:16.560
what's your name?
And Burgos Thompson,
Hoorah jerk.
And the guy goes,

573
00:36:16.561 --> 00:36:20.160
your name is piece of shit.
Oh my gosh.
And he's like,
hey dude.
He goes,

574
00:36:20.161 --> 00:36:21.960
you're talking a lot for a little guy.
Like,

575
00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:26.130
and I could feel the tension and eventually died down.

576
00:36:26.131 --> 00:36:29.540
But it definitely was a,
uh,
a pretty heated moment.
Wow.

577
00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:35.950
<v 3>Um,
this reminds me,
by the way,
I saw the Tonya Harding movie yesterday.
I,
Tonya,</v>

578
00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:38.410
it's the fucking best movie on the planet.

579
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:42.300
And when I go back to the theater and see it with you,
I'd watch it again.
Really?

580
00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:45.280
Dude,
it is so God damn funny and good.

581
00:36:45.281 --> 00:36:48.100
And if you grew up with a fucked up family,
you're gonna love it.

582
00:36:48.101 --> 00:36:50.980
You're going to laugh your tits off anyways.
Tonya Harding,

583
00:36:50.981 --> 00:36:55.180
his mom is a real piece of shit.
Yeah.
And she would push her to be a winner.

584
00:36:55.450 --> 00:37:00.450
She used to pay people to heckle Tanya right before she would get up to skate,

585
00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:03.910
like literally tied to be walking to get on the ice.

586
00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.770
And the mother would pay a heckler.

587
00:37:05.771 --> 00:37:08.470
It'd be like you fucking white trash you piece of shit.

588
00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:12.700
Go back to the trailer because it would motivate her to,
to,

589
00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:17.530
to escape with more fire over.
Isn't that hilarious?
Yeah.
It's so funny.

590
00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:21.030
That story.
I remember how dominant that story was.
That was like the,
sorry.

591
00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:23.890
You gotta see this movie with me?
Let's [inaudible] at all or no,

592
00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:25.540
at the very end they show clips of her,

593
00:37:25.541 --> 00:37:30.490
but the movie's based on interviews done by the husband and her and the people

594
00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:34.210
in the controversy.
It's,
it's so fascinating as a person.

595
00:37:34.211 --> 00:37:38.260
She's got another like foreign,
by the way,
a foreign cursor.
Oh,
good guy.
Gambling.

596
00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:47.520
<v 7>Aw Jeez.</v>

597
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:55.050
Oh Fuck Jesus.
Fuck Maloney.
KIP does.

598
00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.820
Ah Jeez.
Oh

599
00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:01.860
God.
Jeez.

600
00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:06.250
<v 2>Is that good curses though?
Yeah.
I've never those I've never heard.
I've heard.</v>

601
00:38:06.251 --> 00:38:10.240
Fuck Jesus.
Maybe a fuck Christmas.
Fuck Christmas.

602
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:14.530
We learned two new ones.
Dot.
Ponton fuck Christmas today.
Oh Man.

603
00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:17.990
<v 7>Yeah.
Fuck off.
Hey Jeez.</v>

604
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.850
<v 2>I love this person.
Fearfully recording the guy cause you know,</v>

605
00:38:26.851 --> 00:38:30.780
he's like a little timid,
right?
This guy's about to blow a gasket.

606
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.530
<v 7>Oh fuck.
Oh fuck,
fuck.
Fuck.</v>

607
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.070
Next door.
Next door.
Next door.

608
00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:48.770
<v 6>That's kind of fantastic.
That is good.
These machines depressed me though.</v>

609
00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.060
I'm going to start going with that.
Where do you think he's from?
Luck.
GS.

610
00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:55.710
US Scott Ireland.
You think this guy's Irish?

611
00:38:55.740 --> 00:39:00.740
You think English is his native language or Italian?
Know what?

612
00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:04.700
Fuck Jesus.
Come on.
You gotta listen here.

613
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:07.790
But he's doing a lot of and maybe Italian.
No,
he's not Italian.

614
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:11.190
<v 7>Oh fuck.
Oh fuck.
Fuck off.
Fuck.</v>

615
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:16.760
It's Italian next to go next door.
Next door.

616
00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:23.150
<v 6>He's Malaysian.
No,
cause like I,
like I said,</v>

617
00:39:23.151 --> 00:39:27.650
just next door to Ireland.
It's the same thing.
It was nice.

618
00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:33.230
So those machines suppress you.
They're always in the most depressing place.

619
00:39:33.231 --> 00:39:34.490
Is the machine that he's playing,

620
00:39:34.491 --> 00:39:38.540
like the screen with the roulette on it or whatever like Oh,
it's really,

621
00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:40.640
it's really depressing.
Yeah.

622
00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:43.890
There was in bars or like bad bars or going to a bar where this,

623
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.320
the guys putting the dollar in the poker thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.

624
00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:51.090
You just know that like their life is horrible.
Horrible.

625
00:39:51.091 --> 00:39:55.670
And there's a walker or somewhere.
Yeah.
I don't like it says,
uh,
Hey Taylor,

626
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:56.691
this is for Tom.

627
00:39:56.691 --> 00:39:59.840
I was wondering if you've ever been a log or a log or is someone who takes a

628
00:39:59.841 --> 00:40:03.320
shit then stands up and tries to cut the Turd and half with your piece dream.

629
00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:08.000
It's fun and has tried to keep it high and tight.
Tim as well.
Tim,

630
00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:13.070
I got some news for you.
I am a blogger,
but no,
not that kind.

631
00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:16.040
I was a lead logger on reality shows,

632
00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:19.340
which means that you log the footage.
Right.

633
00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:22.760
That was one of my first production jobs here in Los Angeles.
Right.

634
00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:26.960
I've never stood up to cut my shit and half of the pieces cut.
I mean,

635
00:40:26.961 --> 00:40:31.430
your p stream would have to be so laser powerful.
It gets that way sometimes.
Oh,

636
00:40:31.431 --> 00:40:35.740
it does it.
Yeah.
If it's backed up,
if you're backed up,
oh,
I see you p hard.
Hard.

637
00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.670
Yeah.
It's exciting.
It's fun,

638
00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:41.630
but then your pool would have to be really soft that day,
right?
Not necessarily.

639
00:40:41.631 --> 00:40:44.090
You can be really hard sometimes,
Huh?
Yeah,

640
00:40:44.091 --> 00:40:47.290
but you have to hold your pee during your pool,
which is more of that,

641
00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:50.490
especially if you really have to be really awesome.
Yeah.

642
00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:52.550
Yeah.

643
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:55.760
Especially if you're like cause usually what will happen if you really have to

644
00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.780
pee,
pee and poop.
No,
stop it.

645
00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:03.470
You'll have to read favorite top or at least some p and then p again.

646
00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:08.120
That's always been my conundrum in life is how come I sit down and IP I've

647
00:41:08.121 --> 00:41:11.570
finished paying and then you poo but then you make more pediasure.
Boy.
Yeah.

648
00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:15.680
You didn't get it all out that's why.
No,
I think he was out but I think,

649
00:41:15.681 --> 00:41:19.760
I think I've made more pee during the pool.
It's possible but it's really like,

650
00:41:19.761 --> 00:41:22.990
I think that is the whole muscle is not telling him.
Yeah.

651
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:27.060
We got to ask the doctor drew.
Yeah,
we'll save it blue man.

652
00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:28.760
Are we going to see him to get out of it?

653
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:33.800
Possibly on Friday a blue band making note of that.
Questions for drew,

654
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:39.020
the Poo Pee Pee Poop pee question and I making more p or is it just that I

655
00:41:39.021 --> 00:41:42.070
didn't antsy my bladder the first time a mommy's.

656
00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.380
I was listening to a recent episode and heard the measure of nail clipping in

657
00:41:45.381 --> 00:41:48.260
public.
I immediately knew I had to email you.

658
00:41:48.261 --> 00:41:52.970
My friend recently decided she wanted to do something special for her mom's
60th.

659
00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:56.630
She spent way more than she should have to take her mom to a show on Broadway.

660
00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:01.510
They sat in the third row.
At one point,
her mom pulls out the clippers.
No,

661
00:42:01.511 --> 00:42:03.050
it's trimming her toenails.

662
00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:07.790
They read that correctly.
Well,
my friend shoots or the,

663
00:42:07.791 --> 00:42:12.020
what the fuck are you doing?
Look,
her mom tells her at full volume.

664
00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:17.270
It's dark.
No one can see me and this is boring.
Anyway.
Oh my God.

665
00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:18.111
Needless to say,

666
00:42:18.111 --> 00:42:22.790
she was absolutely mortified as her mother proceeded to clip all 10 nails

667
00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:27.260
through her open toed mom heels.
They haven't spoken since they got back home.

668
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:31.580
Michael.
That's horrifying.
It's depressing.
Yeah.
I mean,

669
00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:35.780
she's as Christ that mom,
I don't know.

670
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:40.810
You can't teach that.
You can't raise that.
No,

671
00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:41.660
it's not.
Okay.

672
00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:47.210
Why don't you be embarrassed to cut your toenails and public to period.
Yeah.

673
00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:51.170
In Brighton at a Broadway show.
I'm embarrassed to do it in front of you.

674
00:42:51.171 --> 00:42:54.950
I always closed the bathroom door and then I do it quietly.
I don't.

675
00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:56.990
That's really,
really fucked up.

676
00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:01.260
You don't seem to mind cutting your toenails in front of me or the,
I don't.

677
00:43:01.261 --> 00:43:04.190
I don't mind that I mind.
Why do you mind?

678
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:08.090
I don't like seeing you do it necessarily.
What does it make you feel?

679
00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.940
I'm afraid of it flying at me or just,
I don't like to see you doing it.

680
00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:17.300
One leg up on the saint kind of,
you know?
I never would do it in public.
Ever.

681
00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:20.900
Never occurred in the sky million years to do that in public.
That's disgusting.

682
00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:25.190
I don't mind doing it on the bed.
That's wrong.
That's not wrong.

683
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:27.890
That's wrong.
Why is that wrong?

684
00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:31.560
Why don't you do it where you sleep and then you're going to lay in the and the

685
00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:35.030
shavings or whatever or all you dogs won't get it.

686
00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:39.910
They don't chew that should I do.
It's just,
it was good.
Nice textured here.

687
00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:42.530
Fif hates the farts.

688
00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:46.120
I've asked you to trim mine for years and you've never done it.
Could.

689
00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:50.890
That'd be something we work on.
We work on that.
You think?
No.

690
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:53.263
Hey scrums,

691
00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:57.620
do blind people have standards since they can't glass would lose soup lady be

692
00:43:57.621 --> 00:44:01.730
gross to them.
Hmm.
Holiday talked about that.

693
00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:05.630
Blind people can touch your face and feel what you look like.

694
00:44:05.631 --> 00:44:09.090
So that's how they see your face.
So of course,
yeah,
of course.

695
00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:11.850
They definitely have standards.
They could touch your face.
Oh,

696
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:15.920
you're ugly as shit.
I bet.
Yeah.
Yeah,
for sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.

697
00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:17.500
She's uh,

698
00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:21.350
do identical twin sisters get their period for the first time at the same time?

699
00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:25.260
Tilden.
Wow.
That's I really good thought provoking.

700
00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:28.370
I don't know anything about like the intricacies of how that would work.

701
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:32.010
I know that like twin sisters,
no,

702
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.880
<v 3>I thought I had,
I'm sorry.
I think I'm co-joined twins.
I was thinking of that.
No,</v>

703
00:44:35.881 --> 00:44:38.850
no,
but I know,
isn't there a thing that like women who spend time together,
we'll,

704
00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:42.570
we'll,
absolutely.
Why is that happen?
Absolutely.
I mean,
I don't think,

705
00:44:42.571 --> 00:44:45.870
I don't know if,
I don't know if there's a medical,

706
00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.810
it's hormonal.
It's pheromonal.

707
00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:52.590
So like a home with three women in it will sync up and they'll all have it at

708
00:44:52.591 --> 00:44:54.000
the same time.
Yes.
Let it.
Okay,

709
00:44:54.001 --> 00:44:57.300
so one of whoever is the dominant female will lead the pack.

710
00:44:57.330 --> 00:45:00.630
Whoever's on with the birth control pill,
her cycles regulated,

711
00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:03.990
the other women will follow the one who is on the pill.
It's just,

712
00:45:03.991 --> 00:45:08.370
it's the hormones.
Pheromones.
You pick it up and it's absolutely true.

713
00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.800
I wonder what the utility in having it all at the same time,

714
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.290
I would imagine something nature to do,

715
00:45:13.291 --> 00:45:16.800
like being in a village and everybody being fertile,
the women at the same time.

716
00:45:16.801 --> 00:45:20.550
Maybe they could bring up children together at the same time or a no,

717
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:24.780
that's an all three.
Yeah,
it's the same week.
That's how you wouldn't say that,

718
00:45:24.781 --> 00:45:29.730
but yeah.
Scientifically they could all bust nuts.
Yeah.
Uh,
and all these checks.

719
00:45:29.731 --> 00:45:31.950
Yeah.
I think it would be like,
yeah.
I want to with Michael over there with you,

720
00:45:31.951 --> 00:45:34.410
I wonder am I get a little bag with you and you don't make it a little bit with

721
00:45:34.411 --> 00:45:39.240
you keep fucking all the different girls.
Yeah.
I imagine it's for that reason.

722
00:45:39.241 --> 00:45:39.870
Sure,

723
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:43.830
<v 2>sure.
Cool.
Cool.
Here's a,
let's see what this says.
One more email here.</v>

724
00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:46.470
Uh,
when you have a lot of gas,

725
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.840
your colon swells up and pushes against the bladder,

726
00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:51.480
which causes you to piss abnormally frequently.

727
00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:55.320
When I eat refried beans and drink ice tea,
my two favorites,

728
00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:59.110
I spent an entire day pissing farting like a motherfucker.
Those are your faves.

729
00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.050
Just helps James Hope this helps.

730
00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:06.130
<v 3>What?
That's the email.
This helps.
It says far.</v>

731
00:46:06.131 --> 00:46:09.380
It's pushed the piss out.
Oh Wow.
The West asked about that.

732
00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:12.900
You need a little more context here.
I don't know.
But listen,

733
00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.710
the ice tea or caffeinated to makes you pee more.

734
00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:20.160
<v 2>Yeah.
Hmm.
Um,
yeah.</v>

735
00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:23.760
Very interesting.
Alright.
Mispronouncing words.

736
00:46:23.761 --> 00:46:24.960
This is what I've been fascinated with.

737
00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:28.950
Mommy's on an episode of four 29 with Josh Wolfe.

738
00:46:28.951 --> 00:46:32.010
You're talking about having foreign parents who say wrong shit.
Sit wrong.

739
00:46:32.011 --> 00:46:35.070
My mom is Hispanic.
My Dad is Caucasian.

740
00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:39.300
Both say stuff horribly wrong.
Even though my dad only speak English,

741
00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:44.130
so that's my favorite kind.
He says pigs died.
Not Pig sty.

742
00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:48.480
When a room is a mess.
Yeah.
Write that one down for the act pigs dive pigs died.

743
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:52.510
Okay.
Is it like,
like fucking nonstop no matter how many times I correct them,

744
00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:53.970
still says it.

745
00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:59.210
I'm also 100% retarded because I thought that vapor rub was Bape or rub because

746
00:47:00.781 --> 00:47:02.430
that's how my mom has said in that accident

747
00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:07.220
<v 3>every fucking year they realize it's vapor rub.
Totally.
Anyways,</v>

748
00:47:07.221 --> 00:47:09.560
if you want to move in and you can move and you just got to fuck me,

749
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:14.480
right with Dr drew says far it's 100% push the sheds out.

750
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:19.480
Will that Bape or rub?
Yeah,
I could totally board rob.

751
00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:23.210
Of course vapor rub.
Yes,
of course.
Yeah.
Um,
I actually,

752
00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:24.680
we had this debate too.

753
00:47:24.681 --> 00:47:28.910
We were farting together and I had to shit after I had farted a lot.

754
00:47:28.911 --> 00:47:32.950
And you know,
I don't know if doctor trues entirely right.
We can challenge him.

755
00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:35.320
He's not like the official,
but wait a minute.

756
00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:40.270
Cause how can a fart signal that you have to shit then there has to be a causal

757
00:47:40.271 --> 00:47:43.110
relationship.
What he said was they can okay

758
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:47.690
<v 2>her together.
Right.
Was like that could absolutely happen at the same time,</v>

759
00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:51.380
but they are interdependent of one another.

760
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:55.210
<v 3>Right.
They,
they're not necessarily connected,
in other words,</v>

761
00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:57.970
the Lord and to shit.
They can have their own life.

762
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.770
But I feel like every time I fart a lot,
I have to shit that it,
it's,

763
00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:04.930
it's signaling that I need to go shit.
It's really interesting.

764
00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:09.100
An interesting thing to talk about,
um,

765
00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:12.890
<v 2>being taste tests was a jelly bean taste test.</v>

766
00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:21.610
<v 3>No,
I know where this is going on.
You haven't seen it.
I don't like it.</v>

767
00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:26.710
I don't like this already.

768
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:30.840
<v 9>Yeah,
I didn't know.</v>

769
00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:33.700
<v 3>Yeah,
that's bad.
I knew it.</v>

770
00:48:33.701 --> 00:48:38.120
I fucking knew it and I knew it would fucking leave there.
I didn't know.
No,

771
00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:41.890
I didn't.
I swear I didn't.
I didn't know.
It doesn't say that anywhere on here.

772
00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:45.550
It doesn't say it on here.
Very disappointing.

773
00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:49.530
I did not know that.
You know,
I have to talk about this,

774
00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:55.390
that this is a thing I didn't know it was on there.
I swear.

775
00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:59.350
Look,
I'm not looking,
I'm not putting my headphones on.

776
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:04.370
<v 2>Just opened this.
I didn't see that.
I swear to you.
I didn't see it.</v>

777
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:06.470
All right,
closed.

778
00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:14.920
<v 3>I'm going to take you in to my therapist.</v>

779
00:49:14.921 --> 00:49:18.960
So you can hear me talking about my problems with barfing.
Okay?
Okay.
All right.

780
00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:22.830
I'm not going to put this on because I don't trust you to come on.

781
00:49:22.831 --> 00:49:26.800
We've lost my train.
I just didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
That was not my idea.

782
00:49:26.801 --> 00:49:30.970
I swear to you.
I swear to you.
You're telling me you didn't do it,

783
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.480
but you're operating the soundboard.
You're the one choosing the clips.

784
00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:38.260
So how can you not know it was,
I didn't see the clip before.

785
00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:40.370
I swear I didn't.
I,

786
00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:44.790
all it says is Barf clip because it Barf,
clip

787
00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:49.010
<v 2>look,
Jelly bean taste test.
That's what it says.</v>

788
00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:54.320
All right.
I didn't know.
Didn't know it said that.
Um,

789
00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:58.070
this lady,
I actually saw a remix of this ladies.

790
00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.350
You saw it too because you're like,
what is wrong with you?

791
00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:03.260
I was watching the remix.
Your put your things on it.
Nope,

792
00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:08.370
<v 3>Babe,
I'm not playing that.
Don't trust you.
Lost Trust with you.
I promise.</v>

793
00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:11.570
I promise you.
Yes.

794
00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.990
<v 2>I swear on my phone dies.
I won't play that thing.</v>

795
00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:19.210
This lady was,
uh,
I remember.
Do you remember this?
Cause you're,

796
00:50:19.211 --> 00:50:22.520
you're not going to see this song version.
Just the Independent.

797
00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:25.290
<v 3>There is no god,
but God is real.</v>

798
00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:28.070
I come home drunk from school.

799
00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:32.550
<v 10>Lay level means I'll be a prostitute,</v>

800
00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:37.800
having oral sex with my mouth,
licking his ball.

801
00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:46.770
<v 6>The pastor just took the mic away.</v>

802
00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:50.850
You can't see like she's Kinda fucked up I think.
I think she's still drunk.

803
00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:55.100
She's still like in men's balls and then a

804
00:50:56.790 --> 00:51:00.470
Suede,
the remix.
God,
you know what I'm talking about?
No,

805
00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:05.750
of course you don't made because I'm 41 and I don't pay attention to the kid

806
00:51:06.211 --> 00:51:09.870
stuff anymore.
It is not a kid thing.

807
00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:13.950
Responsible Adult Babe dealt responsibilities.

808
00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:20.130
I reposted it because he took that video.
He's the same one that did the,
um,

809
00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:25.500
what's that?
That white girl who was on Dr Phil.
Remember how about that?

810
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:30.360
Yeah.
Yeah.
So stupid.
So stupid.

811
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:35.220
The the hose.
The hose outside.
What was that?

812
00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:39.930
I forget.
It's so stupid.
It is pretty stupid.
But anyways,

813
00:51:40.110 --> 00:51:45.110
he took that lady giving that testimony in church.

814
00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:50.790
<v 10>Hi,
my name is [inaudible] and I'm on back side or y'all pray for me.</v>

815
00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:53.400
I just come home drunk from school.

816
00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:24.193
Great.

817
00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:31.660
Okay.
Pray for me.
Pray for me.

818
00:52:36.070 --> 00:52:36.903
Right.
For me.

819
00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:47.120
<v 6>I can watch those all day.
I can't do it.
Never gets tiring.</v>

820
00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:51.720
This is why the Internet was created for this time that for their stupid remix

821
00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:54.270
remix is one of my absolute favorites.

822
00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:58.440
Two Thanksgiving's ago I got greens,
beans,
tomatoes,
potatoes.

823
00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:04.663
<v 9>I love it.</v>

824
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:15.090
<v 6>He is really good.
He's really good.
I don't even know the guy's name,</v>

825
00:53:15.091 --> 00:53:16.900
but I like it.
Yeah.
Um,

826
00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:22.530
speaking of there is a no,

827
00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:27.590
somebody made in that whatever vein,

828
00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:28.490
the,
that,

829
00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:33.310
that lane of taking a remix and then cutting video to the music,
you know,

830
00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:34.470
which is what that was.

831
00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:40.580
Somebody did that with machines within [inaudible] machines within the c

832
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:42.900
machines within,

833
00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:48.320
where's it say fall falling knives featuring DJ poly fluid bond mix

834
00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:57.390
in my head over the weekend.
A lot of people,

835
00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:01.770
a lot.
I feel like it's not that bad.

836
00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:15.160
<v 0>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

837
00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:27.633
oh wow.

838
00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:07.973
Pretty good man.

839
00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:44.190
Machines would,
that guy,
this guy,
that actual singer,

840
00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:48.450
<v 6>you know,
we send them a send them a check.
Yeah.
So he,</v>

841
00:55:48.451 --> 00:55:52.750
he got his check and bread for the shirts and then he was like,

842
00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:56.350
I get some shirts now we're setting up some shirts too talented.

843
00:55:56.950 --> 00:56:01.000
I wonder what is next song will be though.
It wouldn't be hard to find out.

844
00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:05.920
Let's see.
Working on,
well I dunno,
I'll make sure to to find out.
Oh,
speaking of,

845
00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:11.080
um,
so yeah,
thanks everybody that got machines within stuff and um,

846
00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:14.570
you know,
the Christmas stuff.
But then,

847
00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:16.780
so last year we did,

848
00:56:16.781 --> 00:56:20.620
during the wintertime we did our gene hoodie try out and a lot of people liked

849
00:56:20.621 --> 00:56:23.680
it.
It was,
it was a big hit.
But one of the things that people,
us,
they were like,

850
00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:24.070
oh,
I wish

851
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:26.710
<v 2>you had a zip up.
I wish you had a zip up.</v>

852
00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:32.350
It's the why IMH zip up Hoodie.
Oh,
it looks so it's very soft.

853
00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:36.640
Um,
Esop does the Gene Hoodie?
Yeah,
it is a soft,
is that,

854
00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:37.630
it's a zip up though.

855
00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:42.660
So tried to do it because many people asked for a,

856
00:56:42.871 --> 00:56:47.650
uh,
a zip up hoodie.
And then,
uh,
to go with the new special,
I have a,

857
00:56:47.651 --> 00:56:51.280
um,
a,
a a t shirt.
I'll just let you find it.

858
00:56:51.310 --> 00:56:54.970
It's up there and watched the special.
And then if you like it you can get that.

859
00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:56.110
And I have like,
awesome.

860
00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:00.610
I have a couple other shirts coming within the next couple of weeks and I also

861
00:57:00.611 --> 00:57:05.050
have,
um,
we're working on mugs,
so there's some,

862
00:57:05.070 --> 00:57:08.260
some mugs coming about just stuff in the store or go to a merchant

863
00:57:08.261 --> 00:57:13.261
method.com/tom Segura or just go to time square.com and go ahead and just hit

864
00:57:13.301 --> 00:57:17.380
store.
Um,
but just stuff there.
I also have a store on my website,

865
00:57:17.381 --> 00:57:21.280
Christine and p online,
uh,
shirts from my special as well.

866
00:57:21.281 --> 00:57:26.281
You may find them so you can find those there and you can um,

867
00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:31.350
put them,
you can put them in your,
but if you get the,
yeah,

868
00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:36.130
why would you say that?
I don't know.
Why not?
Um,

869
00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:39.720
<v 3>you know,
the zip ups totally different than just a pullover.</v>

870
00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:43.110
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Then the kangaroo pouch,
it's a gear.

871
00:57:43.111 --> 00:57:45.950
It's like two different vibes.
Totally.
It's totally different vibes.

872
00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:50.820
When I'm going just full travel dot B day,
I liked the kangaroo pouch gene,

873
00:57:50.970 --> 00:57:55.470
solid item.
Put your cell phone up front pocket.
And if I'm feeling a little,

874
00:57:55.471 --> 00:58:00.080
a little low,
want to jazz it up,
the zip up instead of a zipper and luck.

875
00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:01.163
It's a totally different look.

876
00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:03.860
<v 2>Apparently there's um,</v>

877
00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:08.690
something happening online where listeners are saying,
hey,

878
00:58:08.691 --> 00:58:13.610
blue bland.
We're,
we assume you're in charge of reading all our boat bullshit.
Um,

879
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:14.660
there's a,

880
00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:19.980
a debate as to the origins of blue band and some people have been commenting on

881
00:58:20.331 --> 00:58:24.590
the Facebook group and it says like,
Yahoo is blue band.
Has anyone ever seen him?

882
00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:28.400
Um,
someone who says he's sleep standing up in the mommy's bedroom closet.

883
00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:31.670
Others say he spends most of the time at a local bowling alley,

884
00:58:32.450 --> 00:58:35.510
deejaying a children's parties in exchange for room and board.

885
00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:38.700
No one knows about his background.
Uh,

886
00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:41.900
one frigid November evening when Tommy was out for a walk,

887
00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:46.010
he heard frantic splashing from a nearby reservoir and he went and he saw a

888
00:58:46.011 --> 00:58:49.010
commotion and there was a soaking wet blue van fighting for his life.

889
00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:53.090
And a t band snapped into action,
dove into the freezing water,

890
00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:57.230
grab blue band with one arm paddled to shore.
Since that fateful evening,

891
00:58:57.670 --> 00:59:01.010
blue band owed his life to Dj dad mouth and is therefore you're bound to serve

892
00:59:01.011 --> 00:59:05.810
the mommy's until his final breath.
Hmm.
Um,
he could,
let's see.

893
00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:09.440
Um,
blue band is doomed.
Isolate farts from youtube clips,

894
00:59:09.441 --> 00:59:11.240
sift through listener and submitted email.

895
00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:15.380
I heard he had a double pipe classic one time.
It's very rare.
I don't know.

896
00:59:15.381 --> 00:59:18.010
Do you want to comment on the origins of Blue Band?
Yeah,

897
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:22.150
<v 3>very elaborate story.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

898
00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:26.960
<v 6>but it's close.
It's close to the truth of it.
Yeah.
I mean,
he does live in a nest.</v>

899
00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:32.090
Yeah.
Uh,
but it's on a Saatva mattress.
The lumen leaf collection.
That's true.

900
00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:33.080
And it's in a tree.

901
00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:38.180
It's an entry is one of the few people that doesn't mind putting a mattress up

902
00:59:38.181 --> 00:59:41.270
in a tree.
Most people would be like,
isn't that gonna fall out of the tree?

903
00:59:41.271 --> 00:59:43.070
Not a few.
Set it up.
Right.
Yeah.

904
00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:47.630
You ever seen a fucking tree house before dummies?
Yeah.
So,
uh,

905
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:50.750
he does sleep in a tree.
He is,
he does have feathers.

906
00:59:52.690 --> 00:59:57.650
I don't know.
He's blue.
Yeah.
One more.
Do you need to know guys?
That's pretty,

907
00:59:57.710 --> 01:00:00.500
pretty much the whole story.
Yeah.
Secret identity.

908
01:00:01.050 --> 01:00:05.730
<v 3>Little secret.
You guys,
he was on a show.
He's been on.
He's been,
he's been,</v>

909
01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:10.570
he's been here,
but I don't think we've shown his face.
No,
it's for good reason.

910
01:00:10.571 --> 01:00:15.520
He has a severe scarring on his face.
He doesn't like to be seen in public.

911
01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:16.383
Yeah.
Yeah.

912
01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:20.420
<v 6>Um,
it says here that the hub could help a notice.</v>

913
01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:25.670
Christina has whiter teeth and yes,
you're right.
Keep it tucked,
Rick.

914
01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:27.650
Well,
I know you'd be happy to see that gene.

915
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:31.440
<v 3>Thank you.
I did make me happy and my teeth are whiter than yours,</v>

916
01:00:31.441 --> 01:00:35.040
but I do feel as though I work at it a little more than you.
Yeah.

917
01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:40.500
At oral hygiene.
Generally at oral hygiene.
Yeah.
You're pretty committed.

918
01:00:40.530 --> 01:00:42.810
You don't really brush.
I have watched you.

919
01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:46.880
You just do a very cursory sloppy,
like our toddler brushes.

920
01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:49.970
<v 6>No,
that's not true.
I have a timer on it.
Huh?</v>

921
01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:52.980
I have a timer so it goes right.
I think it was like,

922
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:57.970
have at times it.
I've watched you.
It's not good.
Yeah,
it is.

923
01:00:58.510 --> 01:01:02.540
He brush like a two year old.
No,
I don't.
Yeah,
no.
Hey,
I

924
01:01:02.790 --> 01:01:05.670
<v 3>an observation that's going to make you feel a lot better about yourself.</v>

925
01:01:05.671 --> 01:01:06.570
Are you ready?
Sure.

926
01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:11.550
I was sitting watching a documentary about some crazy person or something and

927
01:01:11.551 --> 01:01:16.551
then it occurred to me that I like mental illness too,

928
01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:20.880
as do you,
but you like murderers.
You like serial killers.

929
01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:23.820
I just don't like the killing stuff,

930
01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:28.470
but we both like people with fucked up psyches.
I mean,

931
01:01:28.471 --> 01:01:32.370
that's kind of the glue of this whole show is you and I both laugh at the

932
01:01:32.371 --> 01:01:35.550
mentally challenged Weirdos of the world.
Right?

933
01:01:36.010 --> 01:01:39.580
<v 6>I don't think that's true.
Oh,
fuck me.
I've talked to Florida,</v>

934
01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:44.610
<v 3>but what I'm saying is I think we,
uh,
you know,</v>

935
01:01:44.611 --> 01:01:48.270
potato Patato I think we'd been arguing two sides of the same coin here.
I,

936
01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:52.110
I've been judging you,
uh,
with your love of murder shows,

937
01:01:52.111 --> 01:01:55.480
but the truth is you like abnormal psychology and so do I.
But I,

938
01:01:57.510 --> 01:02:01.620
but I just don't like the violent,
I don't like the killing stuff.
True.

939
01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:04.240
But we both like psychos.
We weirdos.
It's

940
01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:08.180
<v 6>fucked up.
[inaudible] I'm a Martian.</v>

941
01:02:09.030 --> 01:02:13.220
Yeah.
Like I love fucked up psyches.
I think it's one of those fans too.
Thanks.

942
01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:16.560
[inaudible] is the glue that holds the show together,
right?
I mean,

943
01:02:16.561 --> 01:02:19.660
if you really didn't have any,
um,

944
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.320
<v 2>interest in that,
this podcast when you won't work</v>

945
01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:24.600
<v 3>well,
a marriage wouldn't work.
Uh,
I dunno.</v>

946
01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:26.230
You could probably still find a way to make the marriage work.

947
01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:30.860
You'd be so bored with me if I didn't laugh at the same stuff you did.
Real.

948
01:02:30.861 --> 01:02:34.640
It's true.
You laugh at everything up until violence,
right?
Yeah.
Because I'm a,

949
01:02:34.641 --> 01:02:38.990
I'm a mother.
I've given life and to me it's just,
I can't watch people dying.

950
01:02:38.991 --> 01:02:43.070
It's too hard.
Yeah.
Not like guys,
you guys kill each other.
Blow Shit Up.

951
01:02:43.071 --> 01:02:46.670
We make life.
Women are the opposite of that were destructive.
Yeah.

952
01:02:46.671 --> 01:02:49.400
It gets your fucking crazies.
Yeah,
we're too aggressive.

953
01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:52.680
Testosterone Cube.

954
01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:57.740
Bloody bloody fuck you bloody oh bloodied up blondie.
Yeah.
Bloody fucking bloody.

955
01:02:58.610 --> 01:03:02.260
Bloody [inaudible] has so great.

956
01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:07.760
And then the very casual.
What the fuck man?
What a vogue bad.
What the fuck man?

957
01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:11.150
My teeth are so much wider though.
You do have great teeth.
I know.

958
01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:14.150
Let me tell you though.
I worked for many years.

959
01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:19.370
I had really bad teeth growing up.
This is braces,
headgear,
retainers,

960
01:03:19.371 --> 01:03:23.480
veneers,
you name it.
White nurse.
God Damn,
you got really good stuff there too.

961
01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:25.100
It's like my best.

962
01:03:25.101 --> 01:03:28.250
I would say the good thing about your teeth is that once you get them all nice

963
01:03:28.251 --> 01:03:32.360
stuff like this,
you just got to maintain.
Yeah.
Yeah.
My parents,

964
01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:38.440
<v 2>I know,
right?
Yeah.
Oh,
today.
Yeah.
Dang.
They bought a new house,</v>

965
01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:40.510
like it's their final house.

966
01:03:41.410 --> 01:03:44.410
<v 3>Like we're never going to move again.
I was like,
why is that?
I was like,</v>

967
01:03:44.411 --> 01:03:49.240
oh cause you're going to die there.
Your Dad's pretty open.

968
01:03:49.241 --> 01:03:50.320
He's like,
yeah,
pretty much.

969
01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:56.000
Your dad is very accepting of his mortality.
I found they do this,
this

970
01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.000
<v 2>thing now this is just aging where they call and talk to me about like the most</v>

971
01:04:03.831 --> 01:04:05.790
boring thoughts and,

972
01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:10.220
and no just things are doing.
Like he calls me,
he's like,

973
01:04:10.221 --> 01:04:14.900
well we're a boxing up some stuff now for the move.

974
01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:20.160
And I'm like,
like I'm waiting for the important information.

975
01:04:20.161 --> 01:04:23.240
And I'm like,
yeah.
He's like,
and then uh,

976
01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:27.500
tomorrow movers will come.
Yeah.

977
01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:30.530
That's what happens at over to a new place.

978
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:34.910
I know that you're moving cause we've been talking about it.

979
01:04:35.090 --> 01:04:38.090
Is there a point to this call though?
He's like,
wow.

980
01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:43.940
Oh then nail a set us up and uh,

981
01:04:44.030 --> 01:04:47.300
then it's a new place after that I'm like right.

982
01:04:47.330 --> 01:04:51.830
The concept of moving is not above my capacity to understand things.
Yeah.

983
01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:56.670
Anything else?
He's like got the uh,
which the cable off.

984
01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:58.130
Got a new cable provider.

985
01:04:58.910 --> 01:05:03.910
We're going to go back to direct TV and a male and got new new address because

986
01:05:04.881 --> 01:05:09.800
we're moving now.
Mike,
no pool,
which is good.

987
01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:12.770
Never used the pool even though it's Florida.

988
01:05:12.771 --> 01:05:16.160
We just didn't use it like a,
all right.

989
01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:17.913
I think

990
01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:21.850
<v 3>we're good to go.
Yeah.
Fuck.
He just needs to like more people to talk to them.</v>

991
01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.073
Yeah.

992
01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:27.460
I think this is why I can't participate in 99% of the conversations that exist

993
01:05:27.461 --> 01:05:31.330
on earth.
Yeah.
I can't find,
I can't do it.
I can't hear people's,

994
01:05:31.331 --> 01:05:34.150
the banality of their daily existence now.

995
01:05:34.151 --> 01:05:36.940
What's the phrase he's been saying to you for last year though?

996
01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.220
Tally in mother and I.

997
01:05:39.350 --> 01:05:42.890
<v 2>Oh yeah.
It's been saying this every call.
I was like,</v>

998
01:05:42.891 --> 01:05:47.891
Tommy and I are getting ready for the next chapter,

999
01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:52.340
next phase of our lives with retirement.
He's retiring at the end of this year.

1000
01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:57.570
Wow.
Yeah.
So mother and I are thinking,
so he goes on these fans,

1001
01:05:57.590 --> 01:05:59.660
I guess everybody does well,
you know,
everybody goes like,

1002
01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.500
what are we going to do over the holidays or whatever,
like,

1003
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:06.500
and then you fantasize about your retirement,
you know,
like,
yeah.
He's like,
well,

1004
01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:11.550
I think we're going to do is I'll rent a car and we'll just drive because we

1005
01:06:12.741 --> 01:06:15.740
have nothing tying us down,
you know,
no job.

1006
01:06:15.741 --> 01:06:19.340
So we'll just be able to drive all these places.
Your mother's never been,

1007
01:06:20.090 --> 01:06:23.750
you know,
uh,
the Grand Canyon.
Okay.

1008
01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:27.860
Uh,
Vermont from Florida.
All right.

1009
01:06:28.070 --> 01:06:30.820
He's gonna drive from Florida was like,
we could just leave,
you know,
uh,

1010
01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:34.070
six weeks at a time.
[inaudible] so I go,
yeah.

1011
01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:39.250
And then he tells me this 500 times they come out for Christmas and I go,

1012
01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:44.480
mom,
are you excited about your road trips coming up?

1013
01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:49.670
She just closes her eyes as if to say,
I've heard this and I hate it.

1014
01:06:52.610 --> 01:06:56.330
And then,
uh,
I go,
so do you realize the kind of what he's talking about?

1015
01:06:56.331 --> 01:07:00.080
Like how long I go?
Because,
you know,
he can,
he does.

1016
01:07:00.110 --> 01:07:01.820
He won't do like 10 hours of driving.

1017
01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:05.540
So he's talking about driving like maybe like four hours one day,

1018
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:10.340
five hours from south Florida to the Grand Canyon.
I'm like,

1019
01:07:10.341 --> 01:07:13.910
so the first day,
the first night you spend the night in Florida,

1020
01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:18.830
the second night,
I dunno,
maybe you make it to Mississippi,

1021
01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:21.830
maybe you know the third.
So I'm like,

1022
01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:24.170
you're talking about at your pace,

1023
01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:29.510
eight days going out there and she's like,
what?
And he's like,
yeah.

1024
01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:32.480
And then I see her goal,
she goes,
I'll meet you there.

1025
01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:36.140
And then I just saw his fantasy that he talked about for a year.

1026
01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:39.410
Collapsed in one conversation,
but also I wanted to go.

1027
01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:42.620
Then you ever like think about talking to her about it?

1028
01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:47.630
Like I feel like you just had this fantasy that you never even pitched to her.

1029
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:49.530
It sounded like news to her.
She was like,

1030
01:07:49.830 --> 01:07:53.370
<v 3>Horace,
it's news to her because you've been telling me the fantasy for a year.</v>

1031
01:07:53.371 --> 01:07:54.770
And my first thought was always,

1032
01:07:55.620 --> 01:08:00.620
why would a 70 year old woman want to sit in a car for eight hours a day for

1033
01:08:01.471 --> 01:08:06.450
weeks?
It's just doesn't sound like fun for her.
He was like,
yeah,

1034
01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:11.550
no.
She's like,
no.
He's like,
oh,
like hey,
you need a whole new,

1035
01:08:11.551 --> 01:08:15.180
I think he just wanted to have,
you know what I needed.
He likes plans.
Yeah.

1036
01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:16.010
He likes knowing that what

1037
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:19.690
<v 6>the plan is and now it's like,
hey,
there's no plan again.
He's like,
fuck,
now what?</v>

1038
01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:23.720
Yeah.
Maybe if they got like a mobile home.
Absolutely.
Dot.

1039
01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:28.010
She won't do it 100% no,
that's it.
A little better.

1040
01:08:28.011 --> 01:08:32.850
At least she could lay down and play with the dog or whatever.
No happen.

1041
01:08:33.350 --> 01:08:35.780
It's like a,
that's a,
to me that's my nightmare.

1042
01:08:35.781 --> 01:08:37.430
Like that's like being a feature act again.

1043
01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:42.050
That's all I did was drive for weeks and months and it's terrible.

1044
01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:46.400
It's a nightmare.
I hate that and like staying in motels,

1045
01:08:46.401 --> 01:08:49.670
like they'd have to find shelter every night.

1046
01:08:49.730 --> 01:08:54.230
They get different city like crazy.
Really a bad idea for two old people,

1047
01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:59.630
let's say at the red roof.
Emily,
she's not going to want to do that.
I know.

1048
01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:04.570
Really crazy
boy.

1049
01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:08.210
What a nightmare.
Total nightmare.
It sounds horrible.

1050
01:09:08.250 --> 01:09:12.740
They just cruise drive across the country.
She's like,
what?

1051
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:15.950
I can't think of anything working.
You're going to train ride.

1052
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:20.360
And she's like totally excited about it and not neither.

1053
01:09:20.361 --> 01:09:25.160
I would not take a train ride to d c he's like,
yeah,
it's not,
it's not that nice.

1054
01:09:25.790 --> 01:09:30.170
Uh,
but it's fun and I see her going like,
it's not fun.
It's not,

1055
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:34.550
it's so boring.
Like I think,
cause I've traveled already,
I've driven,

1056
01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:37.400
I've driven through the entire us.
Like I got it,
I get it.

1057
01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:43.580
How long are you gonna spend in DC?
And he goes,
uh,
three nights I think.

1058
01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:47.570
And I go,
that's not in a lot of time to see all the things they have in DC.

1059
01:09:47.571 --> 01:09:50.380
Why don't you stay longer?
When I see my mom looking at me and she goes to a,

1060
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:53.300
went to paper and I go,
why don't you say like five minutes?

1061
01:09:53.301 --> 01:09:57.740
You can really see all the museums and then you took the train back.
He goes,
no,

1062
01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:02.090
he's,
I think we'll fly back.
You know,
it's expensive.
I go take the train back.

1063
01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:07.060
You already took it there and take it back.
Just to get up.

1064
01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:12.340
Take your time,
enjoy the terrain and take a detour.
Take the train.

1065
01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:17.060
See where else the train goes.
He goes,
other rooms,
other places.
That's horrible.

1066
01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:21.200
You know.
So funny.
So great.
And they should go to Europe.

1067
01:10:22.030 --> 01:10:25.490
You will see a dad boner.
Yeah.
See what's going on

1068
01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:27.640
<v 8>or case on right now.</v>

1069
01:10:27.970 --> 01:10:31.700
And there's literally a kangaroo getting ready to fucking jump buys.

1070
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:37.150
Yeah,
we're are the,
how would they see you?
Why are you talking about,

1071
01:10:37.151 --> 01:10:38.380
it's like American guys.

1072
01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:39.940
<v 6>No,
there can't be a king.</v>

1073
01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:41.223
<v 8>There is.</v>

1074
01:10:52.230 --> 01:10:56.610
<v 6>Oh no,
that's nutty.
It doesn't say where it is,
but that is a total,
let's see.</v>

1075
01:10:56.611 --> 01:11:01.380
That's a well earned reaction.
He's in the u s that's pretty naughty.
I think.

1076
01:11:01.381 --> 01:11:04.470
Almost anywhere you see a kangaroo we're running by.
You flip out pretty Rad.

1077
01:11:04.530 --> 01:11:09.480
That was pretty Rad.
What about a dad boner watching a cat?
No,
I saw this one.

1078
01:11:09.481 --> 01:11:13.110
This is dumb.
I don't like this one.
I like this one.
This isn't a dad,

1079
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:14.190
but this is a cat.

1080
01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:17.700
<v 10>Also.
Everyone who likes our Facebook page,</v>

1081
01:11:17.701 --> 01:11:21.150
we'll be invited to a special Lego town event that's not open

1082
01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:27.130
his mouth

1083
01:11:30.650 --> 01:11:31.483
throws the cat here.

1084
01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:44.580
<v 6>Yeah,
he's like me.
He's that guy reminds you of me or no?</v>

1085
01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:48.360
No.
Why?
He's way more sexual than you.

1086
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:54.210
Like the sexual energy is just oozing off of that guy.
You rude,
rude as hell.

1087
01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:57.090
Um,
all right,
well that's it.

1088
01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:00.650
<v 3>All right.
Okay.
Why does your dad,</v>

1089
01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:02.610
did we talk about this last time?

1090
01:12:03.150 --> 01:12:05.820
Why is your dad makes so much noise when he sits up?

1091
01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:07.980
Like I noticed that he would just be sitting,

1092
01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:11.860
he would be like kind of laying back on the couch and they are,

1093
01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:15.830
why the noises?
Like does it

1094
01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:20.470
<v 6>hurt?
There's a lot of things I want to ask him.
Why?
Why do you do that?</v>

1095
01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:25.450
Huh?
He's so hard.
He really is.

1096
01:12:25.810 --> 01:12:29.920
He's odd also so comfortable being himself.

1097
01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:30.711
<v 3>I know.
I love him.</v>

1098
01:12:30.711 --> 01:12:35.000
I think that's why he's so awesome and he really fits into our life.

1099
01:12:35.001 --> 01:12:38.360
Like you were gone and it was just the three of us.

1100
01:12:38.361 --> 01:12:41.000
Topdog LJ and I and l j went down for a nap.

1101
01:12:41.001 --> 01:12:44.600
I wanted to take a nap and he just chilled on our couch and watch like a warm,

1102
01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:49.130
yeah,
he's the best.
I came down and he's like,
Christina,

1103
01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:53.660
you know ls as jazz.
The acute has like he got into that whole thing.
Yeah.

1104
01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:57.380
He just,
all he wants is like a little bit of snacks.

1105
01:12:57.381 --> 01:12:59.940
Like you have to give them some treats every now and then.
His coax,

1106
01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:04.190
some TV and he's happy.
It's true.
He's so chill.

1107
01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:07.850
He's the best.
He's actually really cool to have around.

1108
01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:10.370
I kind of wish he would just live on our couch.
I don't mind at all.

1109
01:13:10.450 --> 01:13:13.810
<v 6>I know.
That'd be fun.
He's the sweetest.</v>

1110
01:13:13.930 --> 01:13:15.610
I think we'll continue to see them twice a year though.

1111
01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:18.080
That's just where it's going to go.
Yeah.
That's too bad.

1112
01:13:18.970 --> 01:13:21.940
Especially now that they're going to be gone all this time.
Chapter,

1113
01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:27.040
next chapter is going to be nice.
All these road trips.
I so too,

1114
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:29.750
I like have to stay,
stay out here for a little while.
You know,

1115
01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:34.000
they don't know what the whole time they were here over Christmas,

1116
01:13:34.001 --> 01:13:38.320
they just went to the mall every single day.
I know we're,
you know,

1117
01:13:38.321 --> 01:13:40.960
there's Malibu,
right?
Like there's the ocean.
It was,

1118
01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:44.530
the weather was beautiful and they were like,
we're going to the mall.
Okay.

1119
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:48.940
So we did Maui,
I guess were related.

1120
01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:54.520
Um,
thanks again for listening.
Please check out.
Like I said,

1121
01:13:54.521 --> 01:13:57.160

disgraceful.

1122
01:13:57.161 --> 01:14:01.480
Also mother inferior is on Netflix.

1123
01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:06.850
You can come see us live.

But thanks again.
Always as always for listening,

1127
01:14:20.441 --> 01:14:22.330
watching the show.
All right,
goodbye everybody.

1128
01:14:22.331 --> 01:14:27.331
This is a diseased Mommy's by Chris Spence and your ego.

1129
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:32.680
You need closeness of other humans to develop the mechanism for emotional

1130
01:14:32.681 --> 01:14:33.380
regulation.

1131
01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:34.280
<v 5>Cha Cha,
Cha Cha.</v>

1132
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:36.763
<v 2>Oh Hi.</v>

1133
01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:42.270
<v 5>But at the end of the day,
what is the race?
Any ways your family could lie?</v>

1134
01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:45.300
We are,
why are we all here on this one?
I was supposed to be equal.

1135
01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:50.130
It just made me pass.
People was messed up and stuff.
Oh,

1136
01:14:50.131 --> 01:14:54.630
hi John.
Down.
Calm down.
Calm down.
Oh,
honey.

1137
01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:03.280
Oh No.
Is that not pretty for your show?

1138
01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:08.170
<v 1>Uh,
for this show,
nuts,
nuts,
nuts,
nuts.</v>

1139
01:15:08.171 --> 01:15:11.370
I'm trying to get away,
but I was restrained out.

1140
01:15:12.130 --> 01:15:15.620
Help to be able to finally distinguishing between true mental illness and

1141
01:15:15.621 --> 01:15:19.130
ordinary misery dots,
dots,
dots,
trying to get away,

1142
01:15:19.610 --> 01:15:22.850
but I was restrained one more time.

1143
01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:28.550
So disease is a complex relationship between the substrate and the environment

1144
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:30.920
that results in an abnormal state of physiology,

1145
01:15:30.921 --> 01:15:33.650
reflected in signs and symptoms that follow a predictable pattern,

1146
01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:36.940
but call natural history,
but a predictable response to treatment.

1147
01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:44.013
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1148
01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:56.850
<v 1>Bunch of guys.
Yeah.
Enjoying each other's company.</v>

1149
01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:04.770
Making this happen to me.
Hello?

1150
01:16:15.450 --> 01:16:15.510
<v 9>Okay.</v>
