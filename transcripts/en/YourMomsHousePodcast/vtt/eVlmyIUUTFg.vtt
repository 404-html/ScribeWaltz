<v 1>Well,

3
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.440

Tommy,
Tommy,
Tommy.

6
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.070
Would you marry your dad?
Just like,
just like the gaze.

7
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.180
Just like,
just like the good ways.
Just like,

8
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.820
just like the gaze.
Just like,
just like the gays.

9
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.840
Would you murdered your store?
Yes,
of course.
My God.

10
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.400
I wish I could calm me.
Would you marry your dad?
Oh yeah.

11
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:53.890
Yeah,
of course.
I would do it.

12
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.480
Oh my God.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Do you want to marry your dad?
Yeah,

13
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.400
of course.
I live for this shit.
Just like,

14
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.360
just like the gaze.
Just like,
just like,

15
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.160
just like,
just like the gaze.
Just like,

16
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.020
just like the gate.
When you married your mom?
No,

17
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.220
I think I got married.
My Dad.
Yeah.

18
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.370
Would you marry your mom?
Hi.
No,
no.
Please.
No.

19
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.980
What'd you marry your dad?
Yeah,
for sure.
Yes.
Yeah,

20
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.300
like just like the gaze.
Just calm,

21
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.980
like the ways,
like just like the gays.
Awesome.

22
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.900
Just when do you marry your dad?
Oh my God.
That's a standing

23
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.340
<v 2>that is a gay questions by MC fluid bond fluid.
Bonder and</v>

24
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.780
<v 0>it says there.
Damn,
Tami,
Tami,
Tami,
Tami,</v>

25
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.260
Tami,
Tami,
Tami.
Yeah.

26
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.140
Yeah.
Tommy,
is this like gays?

27
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.040
Would you marry your dad?

28
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.570
<v 2>Hilarious.
Um,
that's really funny.
No,</v>

29
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.030
it really just got me to thinking now is who I would choose to marry my mom or

30
00:02:21.031 --> 00:02:24.840
my dad.
We did it.
We did this.
Who did I choose?
Well,
my mom's dead.

31
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.840
But let's say they were both alive.
Yeah.
To,
I didn't choose.

32
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.220
I thought you did choose Dana.
I thought so.
Who did I say?
I don't remember.

33
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.720
I thought this was part of,
um,
God,
they're both so fucked up.
Yeah.

34
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.610
Yeah.
Who would you marry?
My Dead Mom or my dad asked him,

35
00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:42.980
will you ever date your mom?

36
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.640
Little known fact is that people really liked that clip and we assume because we

37
00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:53.820
didn't get a lot of traffic on it through email or Twitter,
that they didn't.

38
00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:54.930
But yeah.
Uh,

39
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:59.860
one listener emailed and likened it to a Yelp review that sometimes you only see

40
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:03.950
a review when there's something negative to be said.
It's a good thing.
It's,
no,

41
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.640
I called me mom.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
And it actually,
it was a big,
yeah,

42
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.390
a lot of feedback after we put it out there that we didn't know.

43
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.770
We just didn't know if it was really hitting hard as other bits on the show.

44
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.180
Cause we were like,
we really would

45
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.030
share email as long as you're getting your emails during the show.

46
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.510
Always my emails come in,
we're solid.
And I was like,

47
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.640
would you ever date your mom?
Like you know a really well.

48
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.680
Do you think those are two of the dumbest people to live on earth?

49
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.060
On Earth ever?
Probably.
Yeah.

50
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.050
I mean it's so beyond anything.

51
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.080
Here's the thing too is that they're not dumb enough to know how to conduct an

52
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:52.040
interview.
You know like most people if they're into incest would be like Whoa,

53
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.390
kind.
It just,
you assume would just,
you know,
not,

54
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.670
not even sit down to talk about it.

55
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.280
There should be a level of trying to justify it.

56
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.390
You should have a level of shame where you're trying to conceal what you're

57
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:08.270
doing.
That's intelligence though.
That's on the market.
The market is shame,

58
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.680
but there are also have the intelligence to actually justify it with kind of

59
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.390
pretty decent logic because it's just like the gaze.

60
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.300
It's just like the case the case.
Yeah,
their own logic.
Yeah.

61
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.730
Boy,
I'll fucking turn that off now.
Not that I just,

62
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.310
there's emails coming in and if we just shut it down I did anyway.

63
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.180
Now I'll marry my mom.
This one has an emails on it to,

64
00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:38.170
hold on.
Let me give it that.
So stupid.
Yeah.

65
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.730
I just came back off the road last night.

66
00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:47.731
You've been touring constantly and you know this morning I think what's on both

67
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:52.490
of our minds is what happened to my morning dump you.

68
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.250
It's a great point.
Oh,
you had a really interesting story about it.

69
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.210
Well I did because we woke up together and we both have our coffees and then we

70
00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:06.211
both take turns dumping and I had my coffee but there was no dump and there were

71
00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:12.460
lots of farts.
Fart,
Fart,
no dump.
And I'm like,
what's going on here?

72
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.400
The thing that I like mentioned it a lot.

73
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.860
You've talked about it quite a bit since then.

74
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.600
So it is just exactly like the guys.

75
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.270
Do you have any theories?
Can you help me on this?
Yeah,
you're dumps,
not ready,

76
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:34.060
but I usually go every morning like clockwork,
no matter what.
Yeah.
I mean,
um,

77
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.540
you know,
I wish I could help,
but it's just not ready.

78
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.940
I have a theory if you're willing to hear it.
Um,

79
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.180
I'm willing to go wherever you're willing to take me right now,

80
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.400
the theory is this morning we have the Nespresso machine and we have different

81
00:05:48.401 --> 00:05:52.060
flavor pods and I normally go with intense.
So,

82
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.980
which is a very bold,
strong flavor of coffee.
It's very strong.

83
00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.470
And the numbers of the espresso.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then Nespresso.

84
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.000
But this morning I went with pumpkin spice,

85
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.060
which is a lighter coffee.

86
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.630
And I think because I chose a lighter coffee,

87
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.930
it didn't produce the bowel movement that I desired.
It's a,

88
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.630
it's a reasonable theory.
It's a reasonable theory.
Um,

89
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.660
you could be on to something and it's interesting too.

90
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:24.490
It's a very interesting theory.
Yeah.
Well what I'm hoping to do,
cause I,

91
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.460
I gave up my,

92
00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:30.461
I stubble Americano with a splash of half and half for the double tall soy

93
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:34.720
Latte,
which is old school for you old school.
This is the old school jam.
Yeah.

94
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.760
But I'm drinking with a straw to preserve the whiteness of my teeth.
Yup.
Um,

95
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.880
and we'll see if this produces a bowel movement,

96
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:45.500
we may have to pause a show so I can go shit in real time.
Also.
Very,

97
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:46.910
very interesting.
Well,

98
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:49.850
I feel like it's nice to involve the listeners and our bowel movement.

99
00:06:49.851 --> 00:06:54.350
They don't always get to be a part of it.
Yeah.
And now,
uh,
now they are.

100
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.620
So hopefully,
hopefully that dump comes real soon,
you know?

101
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:01.280
Okay.
Yeah.

102
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.230
I might have to say p o p o Bop.
Oh

103
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.300
no,
that's silly.
Or we haven't even officially opened our show.

104
00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:16.010
We probably should.
Gosh,
what are we doing?
Oh heavens.
Um,
let's get in there.

105
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.860
Let's do it.
Ready?
Ready?
Let's do a jeans

106
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.010
<v 3>and then mean you're going to make them be hand shape and it's going to rotate</v>

107
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.940
on your other hands.
Palm.
Then assign like Butthole,

108
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.820
you're going to make a relaxed fist with the pinky side out and then you're

109
00:07:30.821 --> 00:07:33.780
going to make an h handshake with the other hand and it's just going to mind

110
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:38.170
licking that bottle.
You're also gonna use some tongue action there,
so

111
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.330
<v 1>don't bring it in.
One month into this,</v>

112
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.033
Christina,

113
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.800
<v 2>welcome to a new addiction of yours and called your mom's house podcast and we</v>

114
00:08:40.201 --> 00:08:44.250
are practicing signing.
Uh,
I want to toss your salad.

115
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.790
What I like is her total seriousness to it either she's totally committed.

116
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:55.410
She said it's fantastic.
It's like,
it's kind of creepy when she licks her though.

117
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:56.244
She goes,
yeah,

118
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:58.423
<v 4>let me see that.</v>

119
00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.580
I love this girl.
She's really enthusiastic.
She's showing you dirty.

120
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.940
It's dirty sign language,
I think is so good thing.
That's great.
You know,

121
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.770
first we're going to finger spell it.
T.
A.
And.

122
00:09:18.771 --> 00:09:22.500
T.
It was great about this girl though.
This is very juvenile.

123
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:27.690
Like if you were 11 and someone was like,
did I spell tank course?
Yeah.

124
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.430
It's just like when you learn a foreign language,

125
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:31.380
the first thing you asked for is the dirty words.

126
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:36.890
I remember going to Peru as a kid and learning like I understood a lot of

127
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:40.980
Spanish,
but all of it was Spanish.
My mother spoke,
so I'd never,

128
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:46.830
none first thing was like,
how do you say fuck in salt?
And like,
yeah,
of course.

129
00:09:46.831 --> 00:09:50.730
And they tried to trick you were like all those cut my cousin's row row.
And,

130
00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.140
and they were like,
they,
they said we had lunch or something.
They said,
Oh,

131
00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:59.190
do you know how to say,
uh,
like how to ask for Ketchup?
And I was like,
no.

132
00:09:59.191 --> 00:10:03.630
And they were like,
you say like go [inaudible].
And I know Brandon,
I was like,

133
00:10:03.631 --> 00:10:08.480
I'm not that fucking dumb.
I know.
So they were like,
oh,
okay.

134
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.970
Well in their defense,
your cousins are sociopaths.

135
00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:14.343
They are,

136
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:20.650
one of them is definitely not your bullshit.
Oh yeah.

137
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.010
Well he's a sociopath.

138
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:29.920
Sociopath.
Jeanette's wedding.
She's got those eyes.
He does have crazy.
Yeah.

139
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.720
Either it's foreign cousin i's or associates.

140
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.590
I think they might be foreign cousin eyes.
He's focused too.

141
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:42.120
And he's intense laser.
That's it.
Yeah.
Intensity,
laser focus.

142
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:47.160
Uh,
he says really?
He's a high achiever,
which a lot of them are,

143
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:52.350
but he also has a very direct sense of humor.
Yeah.

144
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.020
It's funny.
He makes me laugh a lot.
I really enjoy him.
Actually.

145
00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:57.750
It looks through you though.
Ice Cold.
Tight.
Yeah.

146
00:10:57.751 --> 00:11:01.520
He's got real crazy club was a sweet and he's a sweetheart actually that his

147
00:11:01.521 --> 00:11:06.450
court.
Sure.
No,
I do.
I'm,
I'm saying he's one of those guys who puts off like,

148
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.900
oh shit.
Like real intense at his core.
He's a real sweetheart.

149
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:14.490
What was he like younger?
Did he strangle puppies?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

150
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.560
It was hurting animals.
No,
nothing like that.
No.
100%.
Yeah,

151
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:23.910
definitely not.
No shaving llamas.
No.
He was,
um,
you know,

152
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.930
he's kind of an Alpha male.
Yes.
And all that.
But since that,
not,

153
00:11:27.931 --> 00:11:31.560
not what not hurting animals.
They're brothers.

154
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:36.810
These two boys that you spent time with now,
is he the,
is he the eldest?

155
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.820
He has crazy eyes and so that's why.
So maybe that's why.
And the high achiever,

156
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.550
they all are.
They all are,
but they have totally different personalities.
100%,

157
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.630
very different San household.
Um,

158
00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.280
and then the youngest one is very much a young,

159
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.660
<v 2>you know what I mean?
The young,
the baby,
the baby of the group.
What was his name?</v>

160
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.250
The youngest is Diego.
Diego.
You've never met him

161
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.450
and once the sociopath.
Jorge.
Jorge.

162
00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.720
Yeah.
Who's the one that told me about the pink dolphins one ways.

163
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:18.460
I love one voice.
I think he's my favorite.
He's a sweetheart.
He's a sweet guy.

164
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:22.780
Yeah,
I was doing in years.
I miss those guys.
Let's go to Peru.

165
00:12:22.781 --> 00:12:26.350
So I told you it was kind of like one of the most exciting parts of that wedding

166
00:12:26.351 --> 00:12:29.320
was hanging out with those dudes because they were like my,
my homeys.

167
00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.680
Why don't you marry your mom and then you can go over there all the time.
Mary,

168
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:36.430
my mom,
but I couldn't,
you know,
I think we should plan.

169
00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:42.400
Maybe we should plan a trip to pay route or a vacation where we get to meet

170
00:12:42.401 --> 00:12:46.610
somewhere and see them.
That'd be fun.
I want them to go to Hawaii.

171
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.240
Hawaii is great.
You know why?
Why easier for us?
That's true.
That's awesome.

172
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.070
You always planning the trip.
That's easiest for us.
That's number one.

173
00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:59.230
Aren't you happy about it?
Yeah,
of course.
Yeah.
Anyway,
back to my favorite person.

174
00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.480
Yes.
Sweet girl.
This girl is awesome.
Yeah.

175
00:13:01.481 --> 00:13:05.100
Why shouldn't a deaf people know how to sign?
Everything's,

176
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.900
everyone else is saying,
oh,
of course they do.
Of course they have.

177
00:13:07.901 --> 00:13:09.220
That's how this is out there.
Yeah.

178
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:14.460
<v 3>And then we're going to explain what it is.
Okay,
so first for no sign vagina?</v>

179
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.900
Nope.
Not the vagina.
Asshole.
Nope,

180
00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.260
not the asshole.
The tween.

181
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:28.670
<v 2>Oh,
so you got a vagina?
No,
that was all.</v>

182
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:33.380
Yeah,
I like that.
I kind of don't know where.
No goddamn thing.

183
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:35.600
There's vagina.

184
00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:38.450
<v 3>Not the vagina.
No asshole.</v>

185
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.220
<v 2>Okay.
Asshole.
No,
you go no.</v>

186
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:43.740
And then you go between.

187
00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:45.460
<v 3>Nope.
Nope.</v>

188
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.400
<v 2>Between Atta girl,
Atta girl.</v>

189
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:55.530

190
00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.170
but on its side and when it's palm facing towards you and then you're going to

191
00:14:00.171 --> 00:14:01.850
chop that a couple of times.

192
00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.520
<v 2>I like that.
That's great.</v>

193
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:07.210
<v 3>So again,
t a,
I,
n.
T,</v>

194
00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:12.790
not the vagina.
The anus between.

195
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.610
Thanks for watching.
Yeah.

196
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.860
<v 2>Good girl.
She's fantastic.</v>

197
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:27.550
<v 3>I figured we do a really romantic phrase of will you toss my salad?</v>

198
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:33.010
<v 2>This is meant for you as a message.</v>

199
00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:38.050
Of course.
Are you saying that you want me to do it for Valentine's Day?

200
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:42.490
Why did you do to do it every day since I've met you,
it's never going to happen.

201
00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.990
Never.
No,
it's never going to happen.
No,
I mean it.

202
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:52.100
Your butthole is so daunting and Harry and Chocolaty.

203
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:56.840
<v 4>Even though we have the todos now the washlet three 50 [inaudible] I don't trust</v>

204
00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.250
the cleanliness.
Super Clean.
It's really,
really,
why don't you run?

205
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.440
Run your finger along your ass crack right now.

206
00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.080
Take a whiff cause I don't believe you

207
00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.460
were just dressed like pops.
It's not separate.

208
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.460
<v 5>Sure.
On your finger along the crack of your ass.</v>

209
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.290
You don't need to figure your whole,

210
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.060
you don't want to come back with shit on your finger.

211
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:20.270
<v 4>Thank you.
Yeah.
No,
I'm serious.
We do that from you right</v>

212
00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.530
<v 5>now.
Smell which are not smell like a different times of the day.</v>

213
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:28.300
<v 4>Would you run your finger in your butt hole right now and smell it and then tell</v>

214
00:15:28.301 --> 00:15:29.134
me

215
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:33.230
<v 5>what's your ass smells like?
What's your cock and balls smell like?</v>

216
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:38.060
<v 4>It's just some,
it's harmless pup play.
It's just all in eyes and suits.</v>

217
00:15:38.061 --> 00:15:41.630
Just friends hanging out.
It's like a cigar club.
It is.

218
00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.940
It's like golfing or any other phenomena.

219
00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:50.190
Cacophony.
All right,
we're back.
Um,

220
00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:55.430
so what happened was,
uh,
that's a tour shirts.
Hmm?

221
00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:00.760
What do they look like?
So people know what to buy when they see you.

222
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:06.340
So I'm bringing them with me everywhere.
Let's see,
I'll show you right now.
Oh,

223
00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:09.640
the tour shirt.
It's like for the door.

224
00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:12.490
Let me see.
Here it is.

225
00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:14.883
<v 6>Let's see if it</v>

226
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.750
<v 4>comes up.
It's the no teeth.
Oh,
very good.
I like that.</v>

227
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.180
It's on its own shirt.
That's awesome.

228
00:16:22.181 --> 00:16:26.380
And I like this guy that has no teeth and the five a day of Glock drew it.

229
00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.900
Very talented,
very talented guy.
So anyways,
that was a,

230
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.960
a messenger dropping the very cool.
So I'll have,
I have some with me every week.

231
00:16:34.961 --> 00:16:38.990
I can't like bring,
you know,
tons and tons,
but I bring it,

232
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:43.540
you physically have to pack them in a suitcase and then fly across the country

233
00:16:43.541 --> 00:16:47.500
and take them city to city.
It's a better thing.
Like some people ship them first.

234
00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.600
I should do that too.
That I don't know,
man.
You know what,
I've,

235
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:51.550
I've done that before.

236
00:16:51.551 --> 00:16:55.120
The reason I'm against it is because if you ship it to the venue,

237
00:16:55.121 --> 00:17:00.010
nine times out of 10,
whoever collects it doesn't know or it's outside.

238
00:17:00.011 --> 00:17:04.270
No one picks it up.
I don't,
I don't think it's says it's a pain in the red sox.

239
00:17:04.271 --> 00:17:08.050
You know what I'm saying?
Even traveling with them,
it's a pain in the ass.
Yeah,

240
00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:12.730
of course.
Because you have an extra bag.
Yeah.
Then like every city I get to,

241
00:17:12.731 --> 00:17:17.650
I have to coordinate first like,
hey man,
can I drop off this bag?
Right.

242
00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.320
Yeah.
And then it's,
well,
I don't know.
Or what time.

243
00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:24.820
And so there's that whole mess and then you're coordinating with a salesperson

244
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.130
to sell them and then you've got sizes.

245
00:17:27.131 --> 00:17:30.460
So now you've got to bring where you don't have the excel,
you don't have els.

246
00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:33.950
Then there's the settlement.
I then,
did I even tell you what happened then?

247
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:37.600
Oh Man,
I thought over the weekend,
the one of the cities,

248
00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:42.160
so they count your shirts when you give them to him and then they count how many

249
00:17:42.161 --> 00:17:42.994
you have at the end.

250
00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:47.380
And that's how many you have left is that tells you what your money is.

251
00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:51.240
So the guy did that and he like,
okay.

252
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.020
And then we counted the money and it was off and he's like,

253
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:59.430
he started doing like,
uh,
um,
uh,

254
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.870
see,
I see.
So is that right?
And we're like,
no,
that's wrong.

255
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.400
How much is it supposed to be?
We kept repeating the same.
No.

256
00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:11.220
So I thought what he was doing was,
um,
doing the,
where you down technique,

257
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:12.560
where you,

258
00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:17.420
you keep saying it and then what that person hopes for is that you go,

259
00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:21.510
right.
So I just went like,
well,
I guess,
you know,
just count it again.

260
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:26.750
And then he was,
uh,
yeah,
so,
and then he kept looking around like I go like,

261
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:31.230
do you think money's laying under shirts or something?
You know,

262
00:18:31.231 --> 00:18:34.800
it was just like this ongoing thing.
So I told the promoter,
I go,

263
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:39.960
I'm going to go here and talk to some friends.
You,
you handle it,
dude.

264
00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:44.790
20 minutes later I went back.
He had miscounted the,
uh,

265
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:48.960
the shirts at the end.
So he was the correct amount of money was there.
Right.

266
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:54.260
But at first I really thought he was just trying to be slick with it.

267
00:18:55.040 --> 00:19:00.040
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
Well that's the thing.
It's human error.
It's all small.
But you know,</v>

268
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.260
it's funny because in our business there's human error all the time.

269
00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.620
Course they give you the ticket things and at the numbers don't match.

270
00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:11.600
I would say most of the time I get paid inaccurately or something's inaccurate

271
00:19:11.601 --> 00:19:12.320
and yeah.

272
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.990
<v 4>Yeah.
That's another thing,
by the way,
for all businesses.
I mean,</v>

273
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.870
I had one a few,

274
00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:22.220
few months ago or I finished the show and you know,
every,

275
00:19:22.221 --> 00:19:24.260
for people that don't know how it works in comedy,

276
00:19:24.261 --> 00:19:27.910
I mean every Gig you do has its own,
its own contract.
Yeah.

277
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:33.610
And it was like a percentage and then you knew how many tickets are involved,

278
00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:39.230
right?
Like yeah,
you know exactly the price of the tickets.

279
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.520
So the math is really for somebody that's horrible at math it's very easy and

280
00:19:43.521 --> 00:19:46.700
laid out.
So the guy was like,
you sold out.
So I'm like,
great,

281
00:19:46.701 --> 00:19:50.240
that's that many tickets that's at that ticket price.
And that's the percentage.

282
00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:54.680
And he goes,
guess what you made?
And I go,
I don't have to guess.
And he's like,

283
00:19:54.681 --> 00:19:58.370
what do you mean Your Jab?
I go,
well there's no guessing because I know.

284
00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.030
And he goes,
well what do you think it is?
I know,
I don't think it's something,

285
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:07.040
I know what it is.
Right.
And then I told him and he's like,
ah,

286
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:10.650
that's not what I have.
And I go,
yeah,
there's not different versions of,

287
00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:11.630
of what it could be.

288
00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:17.080
It is this because the deal was x number of tickets at x dollars for the results

289
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:22.700
of this percentage.
And I explained that to him.
He was like,

290
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:25.220
oh no one is going on here.
Yeah,
they never,

291
00:20:25.221 --> 00:20:28.430
and they start like like calling other people and I was just sitting there,

292
00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.370
it's exhausting and the end he was like,
you know what?

293
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.000
You actually had the number right now.

294
00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.380
<v 2>I of course,
man.</v>

295
00:20:34.381 --> 00:20:38.930
Yeah cause it's in the contract that we both signed months and months like no,

296
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:43.940
my favorite is I did a club where the ticket count was one thing and then the

297
00:20:44.131 --> 00:20:48.190
dollar amount was another and I'm like this is so wrong.
Like it's wrong.

298
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.290
Well what happened was,

299
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.660
you know it was from the show before the numbers got mixed up and dead that it's

300
00:20:55.661 --> 00:20:55.930
like

301
00:20:55.930 --> 00:21:00.410
<v 4>what do you,
what is this?
What business are we speaking of?
Another business.</v>

302
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.180
How about the airline thing that happened to me this week.

303
00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.180
You bought a ticket for someone.

304
00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:10.740
I have the coordinating travel is a horrible,

305
00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.080
as most people know when you're coordinating it for a tour,

306
00:21:13.081 --> 00:21:15.960
like I'm doing where it's a different city every day.

307
00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:21.030
It's really stressful.
Yeah.
So,
um,

308
00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.950
and also I bring a,
an opening act and I take care of their travel.

309
00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:31.110
So I reached out to management company and they were like,
well yeah,

310
00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:36.440
what people do is they use a travel agent who specializes in Torin,

311
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.420
right?
So you go,
okay,
so I hire these people,

312
00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:43.050
it's really a actually really reasonable fee.

313
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:47.260
They just put a a fee on a ticket book,
right.
And they get discount.

314
00:21:47.261 --> 00:21:49.380
So you anyways,

315
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:53.310
I also get notifications on my phone when my card is used,

316
00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:57.770
the credit card pops up that,
uh,

317
00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:02.850
like $7,500 charge pops up on my phone.
And I was like,

318
00:22:02.851 --> 00:22:07.800
Whoa,
what is that?
So I called the credit card company and they go,

319
00:22:07.801 --> 00:22:11.100
Oh yeah,
it's a British Airways.
And I'm like,
well,

320
00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:13.200
as much as I'd love to go to the UK,

321
00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:18.630
I haven't bought anything on British Airways.
And they're like,
well,
you did now.

322
00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:22.860
So they're like,
is it fraud?
I'm like,
I guess so.
Cause I didn't buy it

323
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.480
<v 2>well.
And it's not uncommon to have fraud on our cards.</v>

324
00:22:25.481 --> 00:22:30.280
I think one time somebody in London went to like,
it's so weird,

325
00:22:30.281 --> 00:22:32.990
why wouldn't card thievery happens in the UK a lot.

326
00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:36.750
[inaudible] my favorite about that was that those men James

327
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:41.440
<v 4>called and they,
they just asked a very nonchalantly,
they go,
hey,</v>

328
00:22:41.441 --> 00:22:44.740
did you spend,
I'm sorry Mr Seeger.
We were,
you know,

329
00:22:44.741 --> 00:22:49.741
this is whatever credit card did you spend $25,000 at Christian Dior in London?

330
00:22:50.231 --> 00:22:54.700
And I go,
no,
I actually did not.
They're like,
oh,
okay.
Well somebody did.

331
00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:00.440
Thank you very much.
Yeah.
So anyways,
it turns out not only,
uh,

332
00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.000
there was no fraud.
The travel guy accidentally,

333
00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:09.090
he's explained that like on the profiles that if he does things too quickly that

334
00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:14.220
the profile doesn't like move on to the next refresh.
Yeah.

335
00:23:14.221 --> 00:23:16.330
And it may explain it it and I totally believe that,
but he was like,

336
00:23:16.331 --> 00:23:20.560
I had your profile up.
I then,
you know,

337
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:22.060
was done with what?
With you.

338
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:26.980
I pulled up the next person's and I had their thing ready to go and I just hit

339
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:32.080
purchase and it went,
it used your profile information for their ticket.

340
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:37.360
And then I not only was it that,
but that I bought it for a very special guy.

341
00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.380
You're going to tell him who it is.
I mean I think he,
I think I deserve a little,

342
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:45.590
yeah,
it's Robert Pattinson.

343
00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:47.660
<v 2>He's a band.
Yeah.</v>

344
00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:52.760
Maybe you just bought a vampire her plane ticket cause he's team a better team.

345
00:23:52.761 --> 00:23:53.870
Edward Edward.
Yeah.

346
00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:58.420
<v 4>All the last one I did when I found out it was for him.
Yeah.</v>

347
00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.650
I said let him keep it.

348
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:04.480
<v 2>So it's a joy to purchase.
Cause are you,</v>

349
00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:08.080
you're really a big fan of those twilight movies.
I know you love them.

350
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:12.910
<v 4>I go,
listen,
I've been looking at uh,
Robert for about seven,</v>

351
00:24:12.911 --> 00:24:16.540
eight years now.
Yeah.
Long enough to feel like I owe him a 70.

352
00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:20.150
<v 2>You really are team Edward Over Jacob though,
right?
Am I mean,</v>

353
00:24:20.151 --> 00:24:22.850
let's be serious here for a minute.
100%.
Yeah.

354
00:24:22.851 --> 00:24:25.580
What do you like more about Edward Versus Jacob?
I mean,

355
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.370
just a here's a better knows.
Yeah,

356
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:31.310
he does Taylor Lautner kind of hassling of a wonky

357
00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:36.310
<v 4>kind of a like a like a button,
like a square.
Almost like a baby knows.
Yeah.</v>

358
00:24:36.311 --> 00:24:41.020
It's weird,
but it's oddly big too.
Okay.
Yeah.
Go ahead.
What else?
Oh,

359
00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:44.200
was big British eyes like that jaw line,

360
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:49.610
<v 2>but he Jacob's or,
yeah,
but who'd be more fun to hang out with?</v>

361
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:55.530
That's a good,
that's a really good question.
Hey God dammit.

362
00:24:57.310 --> 00:25:01.010
It's a really good question because Edwards like this educated,
he's been,

363
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:05.180
he's been alive for hundreds of years.
Yeah,
but then Jacob,

364
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:09.260
they're kind of all about the party and the fun.
They're down to earth.

365
00:25:09.261 --> 00:25:13.040
They keeps it real,
so it's kind of,
hey,

366
00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.250
come here and I'm not saying that sounds good for our show.
Come here

367
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.690
<v 4>now.
Do you think it's good when you yell,
Hey,
come into the mic.
Come here buddy.</v>

368
00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:22.450
My heads away.
It's pretty loud.

369
00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:26.830
What'd you want her to keep barking or do you want it to stop?
Hey,

370
00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.570
do you want her to stop?
I want her to stop.

371
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:32.710
Then she stopped because I have her stay here.
Dummies?
Yeah.

372
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:37.770
<v 2>Oh,
I hope I can take a shit soon.
Well,
so who are you choosing?</v>

373
00:25:37.771 --> 00:25:40.860
Team Edward or team Jacob?
I am.
I switched depending on my mood,

374
00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:44.490
but Edward abandoned her.
Let's not forget.

375
00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:49.000
<v 4>I'm going to kill you.
I abandoned her.</v>

376
00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:53.620
And Robert and Taylor Loner.
Yeah.

377
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:59.510
<v 2>Not as characters.
Not as vampires.
No.
The reason I liked him,
Edward.</v>

378
00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.700
Yeah,
I like him more aesthetically.
Robert.

379
00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:06.310
You know why I don't really like muscular dudes.
It's not my thing.

380
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:10.610
Got It.
I don't like those big horse cocked.

381
00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:15.320
Muscular fit.
Athletic looking guys.
Oh,
can you?

382
00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:16.530
I'm going to rein these dogs in.

383
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:21.260
<v 4>Okay,
hold on.
Okay.
Why?
Why?
What?
What's the,
I'm putting,</v>

384
00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:25.880
you're the fucking throwing shit personality champion.
Oh

385
00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:26.600
<v 2>God.</v>

386
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.180
You're just grumpy because you're tired and you've been on the road for a long

387
00:26:29.181 --> 00:26:32.810
time and your rugby.
Yeah,
but also because you won't,
you know,

388
00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:36.890
but so to Davidson sign,
I'm going to say my salad.

389
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:39.770
You tossed salad mean like butthole.

390
00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:45.210
<v 4>Yeah.
That's my really like her.
She's fantastic.
She brightens my day.</v>

391
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.470
You should tell your couple of cues from her.

392
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:51.210
<v 3>So we're gonna start off with mine.
Just put your hand on your chest salad.</v>

393
00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:54.200
You're actually gonna online tossing a salad and you're going to puck your

394
00:26:54.201 --> 00:26:55.190
cheats out.
So,

395
00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:58.043
<v 1>okay.</v>

396
00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:01.790
<v 3>Um,
you,
you're going to point to the person to saying top salad.</v>

397
00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:05.240
I'm going to do the same as the sign for salad,
but slightly larger.

398
00:27:05.241 --> 00:27:08.510
And I'm going to mount the word toss while I'm signing it.
So

399
00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:12.093
<v 1>awesome.</v>

400
00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.700
<v 3>And then mean you're gonna make a v hand handshake and it's going to rotate on</v>

401
00:27:16.701 --> 00:27:19.490
your other hands.
Palm then decided like Butthole,

402
00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.340
you're gonna make a relaxed fit with the pinky side out,

403
00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.670
and then you're going to make an age handshake with the other hand and it's just

404
00:27:25.671 --> 00:27:27.920
going to apply the same staff though.

405
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:30.680
You're also going to use some tongue action there.
So

406
00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:34.653
<v 1>awesome.</v>

407
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.600
<v 3>So we're gonna put it all together and say my salad,</v>

408
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:42.890
you tossed salad mean.

409
00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:49.190
Yeah,
that's,
it's so hot.
All right.
Herei.
Thanks for watching.

410
00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:53.070
<v 4>It's hot.
I didn't know she was going down that road.
I didn't think so.
Either.</v>

411
00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.430
It's hot and know what she's into now.

412
00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.950
A little piglet.
Yeah.
She's,

413
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.130
she's an animal.
Not like you.

414
00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:08.430
Do you think she's into tossing someone salad or having hers toss a,

415
00:28:08.431 --> 00:28:11.460
I think she's into all of it.
She seems like the kind of person that would,
uh,

416
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:16.530
be done any of it.
She's really,
I mean,
look at her,
she's doing videos,

417
00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:19.620
look at her,
what she's doing videos about how to say,

418
00:28:19.621 --> 00:28:23.750
toss it and I want to toss salad.
And she's like,

419
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.420
that's so hot.
I mean,
she's into it.
She's a new it.
Yeah.

420
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.270
Are you in to her now because of that?
Of course.
That's so attractive.

421
00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.340
Remember there was a time where people wrote in and they were like,
I would,

422
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:39.090
I would eat Tom's asshole.
They were coming up to me at shows.

423
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:44.760
Sometimes you don't actually not sometimes I think 99% of the time it was as

424
00:28:44.761 --> 00:28:48.620
couples where like the guy,
I'd be like,
go for it.

425
00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:54.790
Um,
I,
uh,
I would lick your butthole.
Like she would say like,

426
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:59.340
he totally put it up her up to it or whatever I'm supposed to say.

427
00:28:59.341 --> 00:29:02.130
I would look your butthole and then I would look at the guy,
he'd be like,

428
00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.950
Oh,
okay,
thank you so much.
Special.

429
00:29:07.951 --> 00:29:11.040
It does feel like a really nice thing to say to somebody.
Did it,

430
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.920
did it make you feel nice?
And so I thought it was like,

431
00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.740
it was kind of like maybe,
I dunno.
I,

432
00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:22.350
I felt like kind of like I was in a wheelchair and uh,
somebody goes like,
oh,

433
00:29:22.351 --> 00:29:26.760
you know,
I would fuck you.
And you're like,
oh,
thanks.
Not that.

434
00:29:26.761 --> 00:29:28.770
Like if you're in a wheelchair,
no one says that.

435
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:30.940
But it felt kind of like they were putting their arm around me.

436
00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.580
Like I was the last kid picked on the team and they're like,

437
00:29:35.581 --> 00:29:40.530
you can play with us.
You know,
like that is the last butthole on earth.

438
00:29:40.531 --> 00:29:42.430
I would lick maybe the last

439
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:47.200
<v 2>one.
Let me think.
Hold on.
Such a jerk.
I would.
Well,</v>

440
00:29:47.201 --> 00:29:50.050
I don't know.
I just,
I just know you,
you haven't smelled your,

441
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.180
your butt hole by the way.
Oh yeah.

442
00:29:52.181 --> 00:29:56.020
I was supposed to run my finger along the crack.
You know,
it's clean right now.

443
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.850
Let's do it anyways.
Why?

444
00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:02.970
Cause I want to verify my belief that I think even if even if you do wash,

445
00:30:03.131 --> 00:30:07.150
I feel like an hour later it just gets gaming game here throughout the day.

446
00:30:07.151 --> 00:30:09.580
Of course.
But right now it's not.
That's sure.

447
00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:12.640
Go ahead and I would it be right now.
Listen,
if you have a minute,

448
00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:15.970
if you have a moment,
I'm busy.
I'm doing this show,
right?
Right.
Your Day.

449
00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:18.160
Just run your finger along your crack.

450
00:30:18.161 --> 00:30:20.230
There's no need to put your finger in your ass hole.

451
00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.640
You don't want to get shit on your finger.

452
00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:26.340
<v 4>It sounds like I don't have to press the button anymore.
That's true.</v>

453
00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:27.860
Um,

454
00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:31.730
<v 2>where are you going to do it or not?
No,
I'm not a fucking,</v>

455
00:30:31.731 --> 00:30:34.760
how are we going to move towards this goal if you don't reassure me that it

456
00:30:34.761 --> 00:30:35.720
doesn't smell bad.

457
00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:38.330
<v 4>It doesn't smell bad.
It doesn't,</v>

458
00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:42.350
but you're not reassuring me while you run your finger along my crack.
The,

459
00:30:42.351 --> 00:30:43.970
I don't want to smell it doesn't smell.

460
00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:48.200
I need you to verify that it smells to it doesn't smell.

461
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:52.130
Okay Babe.
I showered,
shower.

462
00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:57.080
Does it matter after the doe?
Does it matter?
Yeah,
it does matter.

463
00:30:57.081 --> 00:31:00.680
Of course it matters now because you're gross.
Everything's gross all the time.

464
00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:05.630
Oh my God.
So much going on politically.
Um,
and uh,

465
00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:10.970
what am I,
you know,
I love hearing the different perspectives on all the issues.

466
00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:14.930
Um,
this is one that I very much captivated by

467
00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.070
<v 7>building the wall.
Tell y'all the wall was coming.</v>

468
00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:22.990
We're going to keep them motherfuckers out.
We'd run the industry map,

469
00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:26.530
go and follow.
Look smart.
Steve Lobbied Bill

470
00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:32.750
as we build as well around the instrument.
Looks up,

471
00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:34.453
we hear baby.

472
00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:36.620
<v 4>Absolutely fantastic.
Uh,</v>

473
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
this is just a black guy in a blonde wig with a blue coat and a red tie and he's

474
00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.160
little Trump.
I Dunno.

475
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:47.970
<v 2>What's he selling?
What's does it look what's saying?
Oh No,
just followers.</v>

476
00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.860
That's why I think I don't understand is like what's the cell?
Yes.

477
00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:53.610
<v 4>Makes me so happy.</v>

478
00:31:53.611 --> 00:31:58.560
I saw it on the street watchers page on Instagram and uh,

479
00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:03.690
I don't know exactly what I love so much about how,
just how simple.

480
00:32:03.691 --> 00:32:08.310
First of all the outfit is,
you know,
that he was just like,
okay,
I'll be Trump.

481
00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:11.640
How so?
Well,
I'll put on a red tie and I'll put on a blonde wig.

482
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:12.960
We're going to talk about the wall.

483
00:32:12.961 --> 00:32:17.520
I'm just going to pick up two bricks and that he's essentially just saying,

484
00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:23.050
I'm Trump.
I'm little Trump because I got a wig basically right now.

485
00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:24.090
Horrible Blonde Wig.

486
00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:28.110
It's really fucking funny and it's also just go out to the front line and we'll

487
00:32:28.111 --> 00:32:32.490
just go on the front row.
We build a wall baby,
and they said we're going to keep,

488
00:32:32.491 --> 00:32:33.490
the month is out.

489
00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:39.590
<v 2>Absolutely love it.
I've watched it over 40 Oh,</v>

490
00:32:39.591 --> 00:32:41.870
I know when you've been repeating it over and over.

491
00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:46.860
<v 7>No told y'all the while was cut.
We don't keep the motherfuckers out.</v>

492
00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:48.770
We run the industry now.

493
00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:54.650
<v 2>I don't know.
That's why I don't understand any of that.
We've run in the end.</v>

494
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:56.263
We are baby

495
00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:03.560
<v 7>boom.
Follow the swamp.
Steve Wabi Bill.
Okay.</v>

496
00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:07.490
See the wealthy follow history be on this wall around the industry.

497
00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.820
<v 2>Around the anime industry.
Huh?
Okay.
Well that's what I'm saying.</v>

498
00:33:10.821 --> 00:33:15.290
Is this guy in it for the social media glory.
Well,
Dylan,

499
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.180
I mean the way he's talking,
it sounds like,

500
00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:21.410
you know the way like a rapper would talk.
We're,
we're taking over the industry.

501
00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.400
Sorry,
where's your water?
Where's your water?
It's over here.
It's under the table.

502
00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:26.150
Oh is it?

503
00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:30.410
Let's see that because I'm looking and I don't see you having any water.

504
00:33:30.411 --> 00:33:33.630
It's interesting cause I'm sipping on my scissors.

505
00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:39.160
Let me finish the trouble because there's also a refreshing of Trump at the

506
00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:40.843
White House having breakfast

507
00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:47.190
<v 7>only in a matching.
You get to eat like this little low huddle house.</v>

508
00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:50.640
You have to be invited to match a need like this.

509
00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:55.940
This is how we do it every day baby.
This is how we live.
Yeah.

510
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:58.050
And you mentioned baby in the medicine.

511
00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.680
<v 4>I Dunno why he maintains a mansion as opposed to the White House shore.</v>

512
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:05.880
The best part of this clip is that that is,
you know,

513
00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:09.580
presumably where it would end.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

514
00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:13.260
They just keep rolling right and cut and no one knows what to do.

515
00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:17.780
So the guy's just staring at the camera.
It's a nice house though.
Yes.
Great.

516
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:22.160
Nice breakfast for sure.
Sure.
It's got orange juice,
coffee,
milk,

517
00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:27.000
and orange slices too.
I liked that too.
The CEO Georgia mug.
Yeah.
Waffle.

518
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.110
I mean money from the food back to the guy.
Yeah.

519
00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:35.370
The guy still puts his fork and knife.
Make sense?
Yeah.

520
00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:41.060
<v 2>I don't know what that means is in a robe with his bond.</v>

521
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.570
<v 4>Well,
they've got the flag there.
That's good cop work.
Yeah.
All right.</v>

522
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:49.890
Just let them eat,
man.
Yeah,
that's good.
When it's like that going to,

523
00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:53.310
he's putting the yolk with the potatoes.
It really good.

524
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:57.740
<v 2>Well,
I don't find that one is hilarious as you do.
I like it,
but I'm not like,</v>

525
00:34:57.741 --> 00:35:01.520
lol.
Thanks so much.
And I think we agree to disagree on that one.
Okay,

526
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:02.570
well I'm just saying,

527
00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:07.520
all I'm saying is if you're looking for maybe a unique perspective on the

528
00:35:07.521 --> 00:35:11.470
political situation,
maybe little Trump is the way to go crossfire

529
00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:16.220
<v 4>next week.
Yeah.
Yes.
So that's,
that's just,
I don't know.
That's just my opinion.</v>

530
00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.160
Okay.
Um,

531
00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:23.380
now one thing that we haven't visited in a while is I'm coaching.

532
00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:28.720
I love coaches with a message and this is a little league coach,

533
00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.910
a little league baseball coach,

534
00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:37.540
and it's pretty intense how he talks to children playing

535
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:39.053
<v 2>baseball.</v>

536
00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:44.260
<v 7>I want to make it,
this is our last night,
Aiden.
Eyes on me.</v>

537
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:45.303
89 on me.

538
00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:49.110
<v 2>You'd have to say eyes on me.
You know,
near not interested.</v>

539
00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:51.240
Of course they're kids.
How old you think these kids are?

540
00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:56.280
<v 7>Make sure you guys remember what our goals are when we step on this field.</v>

541
00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:00.870
Jackson,
we're the next.
What's one of our goals when we stepped on the field

542
00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:06.180
to do your basket?
You're not even close.

543
00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:12.690
<v 2>Hey,
great.
Yeah.
Good coach.
Good to do your bestest.
Not even close.</v>

544
00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:16.470
Well,
that's not the super relative best and the way that they're,
that kid,

545
00:36:16.471 --> 00:36:20.190
his voice just sounded,
I'm guessing six or seven.
Is he eight?
Yeah.
Yeah.

546
00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:23.330
<v 7>Our goals are to hit dingers.</v>

547
00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:26.780
Everybody better have their eyes on me.
Eyes on me.

548
00:36:26.781 --> 00:36:30.650
Reiland hitting or disgrace.
The pictures.
Family,

549
00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:34.610
the other families,
other players cry like this.

550
00:36:34.611 --> 00:36:39.200
Dump their buds into the crowd.
Does everyone understand that?
Yes.

551
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:43.970
<v 2>I like this pretty great.
I would have Ellis play with this guy.
Yeah.</v>

552
00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.890
This is real life shit.
I like.
I agree.
You know,
because doing,

553
00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:52.160
you're just doing your best is really not good life advice.
Yeah,

554
00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:57.190
because it's not really the point.
The point is to win.
Yeah.
We're losing sucks.

555
00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.080
I know.
You should always teach your children that.

556
00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:02.830
I'll take him out of any participation award should get the fuck Outta here with

557
00:37:02.831 --> 00:37:06.700
that or merit awards.
I used to get a bunch of those too.
Yeah.

558
00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:11.230
<v 7>There are two types.
There's two types of people in this room.</v>

559
00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:14.560
There's winners and there's losers.

560
00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:19.300
Just so that we're clear.
Every time we step on this field,

561
00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:22.320
our goal is to be a winner.

562
00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:26.970
<v 2>Yup.
There you go.
How many teams?
How many parents got in infuriated by this?</v>

563
00:37:26.971 --> 00:37:31.530
I'm sure.
A lot speech.
Yeah.
Well they're losers,
so they would,
that's right.
Yeah.

564
00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:32.573
I like this guy

565
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.460
<v 7>and if your dad,
he said,
oh,</v>

566
00:37:35.461 --> 00:37:39.820
it doesn't matter whether you win or lose just as long as you have fun.
Yeah.

567
00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:42.120
Hate to say it.
Your Dad's a loser.

568
00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:49.030
<v 2>Yeah,
I agree with coach right about that.
I agree with that.</v>

569
00:37:49.031 --> 00:37:53.410
Especially at this age.
Yeah.
I mean you want to,
what is it,
the peewee league.

570
00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:57.250
Oh yeah.
This is fucking really early.
Be Dominate that shit.
Yeah.

571
00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:02.020
You got to teach them that losing sucks losing sat.
Okay.
Seriously?

572
00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:07.270
I believe.
Well,
I think this horse shit that you should just have fun.
Like no,

573
00:38:07.271 --> 00:38:10.840
actually when you're playing a competitive sport,
it's not about having fun.
No.

574
00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:13.600
If you wanted to just have fun,
you wouldn't play a game.
Right.

575
00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:16.150
You would go out and rally or what a volley or whatever.

576
00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:20.710
Like in tennis you don't play for for score.
Yeah.
But you're scoring.

577
00:38:20.711 --> 00:38:24.670
So yes,
you may as well fucking trying to win loser is to try to score more.

578
00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:27.890
That's real.
Yeah.
So then that's why there's a scoreboard.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

579
00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:32.560
Dip Shit.
You're fucking dumb.
Shit.
Dummy.
Dumb Dumb Shit,
motherfucker.

580
00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:37.890
Yeah,
no,
I agree.
This guy is spot on now.
If that was excellent.
Yeah,

581
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:42.610
that was great,
man.
I remember those coaches.
Men.
I do.
Yeah,
of course.

582
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:45.520
That's how we were raised.
That's,
you know,

583
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:50.200
gen Xers and gen wires.
That's how we were raised.
And then,
you know,

584
00:38:50.201 --> 00:38:53.200
now it's all fucking pussified.
Nobody talks to kids.

585
00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:58.060
Nobody tells kids a truth anymore about life.
Everything's sugarcoated.

586
00:38:58.061 --> 00:39:01.480
And these poor fools have no clue what's happening when they go out in the real

587
00:39:01.481 --> 00:39:04.420
world.
You know,
there's,
uh,
it's unfortunate for them.

588
00:39:04.421 --> 00:39:06.400
I'm not criticizing the kids.
It's not their fault.

589
00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.590
It's the adults who have failed them.

590
00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:13.300
There's a lot of leaks like that now where they go,

591
00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:18.160
everybody gets a trophy.
I mean,
that's a big serious,
absolutely.

592
00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:22.480
Everybody gets a trophy for just showing up.
Everybody gets a trophy leaks.
Yes.

593
00:39:22.481 --> 00:39:25.400
There are kids not on those,
you know that.
No,
of course not.

594
00:39:25.401 --> 00:39:27.490
And that's never going to happen in my world.
No.

595
00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:32.380
Why would you get a trophy just for doing it world.
The world doesn't reward you.

596
00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.070
They don't want anyone's feelings to get hurt.
Yeah,
that's true.

597
00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:40.260
God forbid a kid would,
you know,
I,
I can't even get into it.

598
00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.020
Hurt feelings are what motivate you to change and do better.

599
00:39:44.021 --> 00:39:45.520
Of course if you never get your feelings hurt,

600
00:39:45.521 --> 00:39:49.570
then you never realize what you're doing.
What makes you want to work harder?

601
00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:54.400
Of course.
Yeah.
And you learn to deal with loss as a child.
That's number one.

602
00:39:54.401 --> 00:39:57.160
Everybody else get the trophy.
I want the trophy.

603
00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:00.030
Then you work hard and then you figure it out.
Yeah.

604
00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:04.900
But to not even let the kid feel the feeling of failure.
I'm a good luck in life,

605
00:40:04.901 --> 00:40:08.470
asshole.
Cause it's all failure and then you win some,
right.

606
00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:13.250
Life is so much failure.
Yeah,
of course.
It's about,
it's about recovery.

607
00:40:13.251 --> 00:40:14.370
Resilience.
Yeah.

608
00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:17.830
And what a fucking dumb lesson we're teaching these kids to give everybody a

609
00:40:17.831 --> 00:40:22.150
trophy just for showing up.
Good luck.
That's fucking retarded.

610
00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:26.350
That makes me so mad.
Does he mad?
I think it's silly.

611
00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:31.510
Like a old lady.
Fuck that.
Good luck.
Okay.

612
00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:36.670
I'm turning into a,
you said yesterday I was turning into a Midwestern mom.

613
00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:40.140
You're such a Midwestern cause I think,
uh,

614
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:42.430
as long as I haven't said awesome sauce yet.

615
00:40:42.431 --> 00:40:46.330
And I feel like once I say that you were just like,
oh my God,
that's my jam.

616
00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:50.920
That's my jam and I'm like,
okay.
Oh my goodness.

617
00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:55.210
That's my jam.
That's my jam.
I don't know.

618
00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:57.910
It was something that maybe we're eating or ordering or something.
You're like,

619
00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:59.140
oh,
that's totally my jam.

620
00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:05.380
I ain't telling him I just have to start wearing cool.
Lot's pretty soon.

621
00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:09.730
You're such a mom.
I mean,
no,
it's all good.
It's fine though.
I like it.

622
00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:13.870
Your total dad,
this morning we were playing with Lj.

623
00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:15.910
You had on your boxer shorts.

624
00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:19.240
They were there now paper thin and you've been wearing them around our nanny,

625
00:41:19.241 --> 00:41:23.740
which is really neat.
Thanks for doing that.
The slippers even imply.

626
00:41:23.741 --> 00:41:27.790
That sounds like you're being sexual.
I don't mean sexual.

627
00:41:27.791 --> 00:41:31.390
That's what it sounds like that all around our nanny,
like I didn't hear that.

628
00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:34.700
You heard that.
People hear that.
Oh yeah,
no.

629
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:38.930
What I meant was no regard for her visual assault.

630
00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:41.300
The point is is that you're not putting on pants,

631
00:41:41.301 --> 00:41:45.230
not because you think it's sexy,
but it's just disrespect.

632
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.710
She doesn't want to see you're a dick and balls hanging out of your,

633
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:53.950
your shorts.
Yeah.
Okay.
What?
Nothing.
God,

634
00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:57.350
let me put this on.
Oh my God,
this show today.

635
00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.570
What fallen off the rails?

636
00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:03.950
How's it falling off the road ringing and the barking and the t shirt

637
00:42:03.951 --> 00:42:08.810
deliveries.
That's all right.
No problem with you as you're there.

638
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.110
The point is,
do you think,
I mean,
why don't you put on pants?

639
00:42:12.111 --> 00:42:14.300
It's weird that you just walk around in your underwear.
I Dunno.

640
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:16.760
I'm comfortable and I'm home.
I want to wear my boxers.

641
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:21.680
So do you think she,
she probably notices it,

642
00:42:21.681 --> 00:42:24.750
but she's too polite to say anything.
Of course you notice it?
Yeah,

643
00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:28.520
but she's probably also like,
ah,
I have three boys.
Three boys,
three boys.

644
00:42:28.521 --> 00:42:32.960
So she's seen all the cock and balls.
Now how are we going to find out or not?

645
00:42:32.961 --> 00:42:34.640
Yeah.
I want you to put your finger down there.

646
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:38.540
I want you to put your finger down there.
You're supposed to get a step closer.

647
00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:43.040
It's not me.
Yours smells though.
Yeah,
but I want you to leave.
It's not sexual.

648
00:42:43.041 --> 00:42:44.570
We're just doing pup play.

649
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:48.170
I just need you to put on a dog mask in a latex outfit.

650
00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:57.930
Okay.
You also burp and fart relentlessly around her?

651
00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:01.560
No,
I don't think Guatemalan nanny.
No,
she has to be a few rooms away,

652
00:43:01.561 --> 00:43:05.960
but for me to do it,
I'll do it.

653
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.120
The other day I was coming home with Ellis and she was already at our house.

654
00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:11.460
Yeah.
And I was,
uh,
I didn't,
you know,
she,

655
00:43:11.461 --> 00:43:14.010
I saw her in the kitchen as I was pulling in the driveway,

656
00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.320
and I go in and get Ellis and the car seat.

657
00:43:16.321 --> 00:43:19.650
I'm taking him out and I just rip a huge fart just,

658
00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:24.900
and she's right there to tell you,
hi,
Miss Christina.
Oh Shit.
She heard me Fart.

659
00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:29.760
You're fart.
But she farts to that,
which she doesn't Fart in front of us,

660
00:43:29.761 --> 00:43:33.990
but she farts.
She's a person I,
yeah.
Yeah.
And she's probably heard a lot of fire.

661
00:43:33.991 --> 00:43:38.420
It's just three boys too.
Oh yeah.
It's all farts in Cox involves paints.
Yeah,

662
00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:43.020
of course.
But no one farts like you,
so that's true.

663
00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:46.560
I'm sure she's not used to whatever you did for her.

664
00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:49.710
Remember last night when I farted and I forgot that I had farted and then I

665
00:43:49.711 --> 00:43:54.150
smelled it and I got startled and I was like,
fart it.
Yeah.
Oh,

666
00:43:54.151 --> 00:43:57.870
smells.
Yes.
Why do you keep saying it?
It's so gross.

667
00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:01.890
Why do you keep repeating it and keep telling these stories?
They're so terrible.

668
00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:04.803
Was terrible.

669
00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:09.390
The story and why no one wants to hear that about what about this far?
It's,

670
00:44:09.391 --> 00:44:11.520
and you're shitting in your farm.
Everybody wants to be,

671
00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:16.540
this whole show is about farting shit and calming and Ah,

672
00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:19.500
do you mean it's good?

673
00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.580
I wish you would anyway.

674
00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:27.750
I thought it was really neat the other week you and I discovered something that

675
00:44:27.751 --> 00:44:32.040
we both hate together and which is very rare because we've been for 12

676
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:36.810
<v 4>years.
Yeah.
And just when we thought we discovered everything we mutually hated.</v>

677
00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:41.570
Yeah.
We discovered one more thing,
which is Frank Sinatra.
Yeah.

678
00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:46.710
I'm not entertained.
I don't think it's great.
It's also not singing.

679
00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:49.470
Why do you say that?
He's singing,

680
00:44:49.471 --> 00:44:52.380
he's not singing [inaudible] sing like him.

681
00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:57.970
De de de,
De,
de la,
la La pop,
pop,
pop,
pop.

682
00:44:58.270 --> 00:45:02.120
Hey Ya da Da da da.
Hey.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

683
00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:03.870
But what about it

684
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.270
<v 8>Maslow?</v>

685
00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:11.380
<v 4>Yeah,
I guess he kind of things that one,
but most of it is like I'm walking in,</v>

686
00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:13.810
there's ladies at the bar,

687
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:18.070
but a prop man bring me a drink and la La la,
and you're like,

688
00:45:18.071 --> 00:45:20.920
that's not really singing,
man.
You're just kinda like,
uh,

689
00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:25.120
raising the pitch of your talking voice.
Yeah.
I,
yeah.
A lot of the songs are,

690
00:45:25.121 --> 00:45:27.970
I like that.
That's singing.
Yeah.
Celebrating.

691
00:45:27.971 --> 00:45:31.210
It's a bebop scared of the dark date.
Yeah.
Yeah.

692
00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:36.070
I think what bothers me about it is that it's such like it's such a chauvinist

693
00:45:36.071 --> 00:45:39.450
stick.
Well,
yeah,
it hearkens apart.
Right?
That's doesn't probably,

694
00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:40.450
you love the boots.
Yeah.

695
00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:44.080
It's such like a Douche be a Douchey chauvinistically thing.

696
00:45:44.081 --> 00:45:48.400
If you're the way have to weigh way into Sinatra,
it means that you have that.

697
00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:50.740
You love that way of like,
yeah.

698
00:45:50.741 --> 00:45:53.140
Back when the women did everything they should be doing,

699
00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:57.390
but I don't have a problem with that at all.
Right.
Hey,

700
00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:01.240
feel like it's good music.
Hey listen.
I was like,
I love listening to him.

701
00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:05.440
I'm like,
really man,
like that's your favorite music.
I think he,

702
00:46:05.441 --> 00:46:09.820
it just annoys me.
I don't like the,
I don't know.
I don't irritates me.

703
00:46:09.821 --> 00:46:12.190
It's always kind of irritated me.
But if I had to be honest,

704
00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:16.930
I'd rather hear Sinatra then Springsteen.
Wow.
Wow.

705
00:46:16.931 --> 00:46:19.600
Me Too.
I agree.
Springsteen annoys the shit.

706
00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:21.820
I do like the song born in the USA though

707
00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:26.470
because I think till like two,
like a Springsteen fanatic.

708
00:46:26.471 --> 00:46:29.560
That's like a laughable one.
Well,
oh,

709
00:46:29.570 --> 00:46:33.000
I mean like to them it's the flagship song yet.
Well,
I don't know many.

710
00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.800
All I know is that this is,

711
00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:39.790
<v 8>oh,
hometown.
Hometown.
So annoying.</v>

712
00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.820
Oh,
oh,
it's

713
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:45.920
<v 4>horrible.
It's the knowing part is how many people celebrate.</v>

714
00:46:45.921 --> 00:46:49.760
Like it's wonderful.
I don't understand.
That's,

715
00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:55.100
I was actually,
we had this conversation maybe on,
on this show,

716
00:46:55.101 --> 00:46:57.880
it was either on the show or it was off the shelf,

717
00:46:57.881 --> 00:47:02.210
but it was with Paulette Tompkins.
Yeah.
Where we talked about Springsteen.
Yeah,

718
00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:05.600
I remember that.
I can't remember.
We were recording or not and he said,

719
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:10.010
I think he put it perfectly.
He said that people,

720
00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:14.830
you see people having an experience yeah.
With,
with like,
uh,

721
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:16.850
music or something.
Right.
So in this case,

722
00:47:16.851 --> 00:47:21.560
let's say with his music and then you digest it and you go,

723
00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:26.750
yeah,
I'm not sharing that.
I don't get that experience that you're having.
Yeah.

724
00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:30.550
Yes.
And I think too with Spring magnitude of his,

725
00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:34.070
<v 2>yeah.
Following your like,
I think that's why I feel more lost by it,</v>

726
00:47:34.071 --> 00:47:37.120
cause I'm like,
I don't even understand why 10 people are into this.
Yeah.

727
00:47:37.121 --> 00:47:41.920
I think it's cultural.
As was Sinatra with Springsteen,
with Lady Gaga,

728
00:47:41.921 --> 00:47:44.590
with any music.
Mariah Carey,
we were watching a show about her.

729
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:47.290
If you identify with it on some level,

730
00:47:47.291 --> 00:47:51.370
it resonates with your experiences in life.
Then you're like,
I get it.

731
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:55.750
Fucking hoes job from Springsteen.
Is that he's the blue collar guy?
Well,

732
00:47:55.751 --> 00:47:58.870
not anyone.
Certainly he's a multimillionaire.
Yeah.
Yeah.

733
00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:03.970
Beyond the working class guys.
Yeah.
Yeah,
sure.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Not Anymore.

734
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:07.360
He hasn't been working class 1940 years.
Yeah.

735
00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:10.320
Yeah.
And he's singing about,
yeah.

736
00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:15.330
What about about trucks and wheat farms or whatever?

737
00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:25.610
Ooh.
Ooh.

738
00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:29.960
You know who else?
Yeah.

739
00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:35.560
Now you didn't shut eye.
You did it.
I don't hate him.
I don't hate,

740
00:48:35.561 --> 00:48:37.780
I don't hate,
I don't like Bob Dylan.

741
00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:41.890
You and I both don't like that switch I'm going to have is good.

742
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:46.720
We don't like that
horrendous.

743
00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:51.100
You won a Nobel prize this year.
Last year for the musics,

744
00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:55.630
he won literature,
Nobel prize for his songwriting.
Wow.

745
00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:57.440
She's had in the bag.

746
00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:05.320
Oh boy.
That's irritating.
Nobel prize.

747
00:49:05.321 --> 00:49:09.120
That's fucking horrible.
I don't like that.
I don't think,

748
00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:13.860
I don't like acoustic music in general.
That is my least favorite genre.
Uh,

749
00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:17.410
gimme a man or a woman in a guitar and I want to blow my brains out.

750
00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:20.770
I don't want to hear,
I don't want to hear nothing like that.

751
00:49:20.771 --> 00:49:24.010
I don't like that at all.
I mean,
maybe it was the age too.
It's two email for me.

752
00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:26.350
When Eric Clapton did that one album,

753
00:49:26.351 --> 00:49:31.240
he did I think an acoustic strangers in heaven.
Oh,
got it.
That album,

754
00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:34.600
that album,
and that song was great.
I liked it.
It makes me too sad.
Well,

755
00:49:34.601 --> 00:49:38.380
it's a superset,
so his son passed away.
Did that,
it bums me out too much.

756
00:49:38.381 --> 00:49:42.040
It's so much of a white bomber.
It's still a,
it's still a good song.

757
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:46.860
Oh Man.
Then the people,

758
00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:49.720
when I started announcing how much I hate Springsteen,

759
00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:52.570
I would get these messages and they're like,
have you tried this?

760
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:55.660
And they're just trying to like,
I don't want to.
So then I go,
you know what?

761
00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:59.930
I should try it,
dude.
I tried staying in it.
Still hate it.
Yeah.

762
00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:03.910
I feel that way about you too.
And I know I'm going to get a lot of heat on my,

763
00:50:03.911 --> 00:50:06.970
uh,
my trainer was like,
we're going to go,
we're driving a Vancouver wherever.

764
00:50:06.971 --> 00:50:09.610
We're going to Vancouver to see you too.
And I,
you know,

765
00:50:09.611 --> 00:50:13.270
she's really selling it to me,
like,
are such a great band.
And I was like,
yeah,

766
00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.670
yeah.
Like I didn't have the heart to tell her,
I just don't like them.

767
00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:18.770
And I was like,
you know,
objectively I get it again,

768
00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:23.290
it was all these objectively get it.
She's like,
well,

769
00:50:23.291 --> 00:50:26.500
maybe you should see them live.
And I was like,
I don't think so.

770
00:50:26.501 --> 00:50:28.940
I think I've said it's a prep prep day.
The more,

771
00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:32.390
I think actually a huge punishment for me.

772
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:36.080
Would it be to go see like the e street band live?
Oh,
is that the,
is that,

773
00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:40.910
is that the worst thing for me?
I'm saying for what I could be like,

774
00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:45.770
I,
I watched their entire hall of fame induction.
I was like,

775
00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:49.970
just,
I couldn't roll my eyes any harder.
Okay.
And,
uh,
I,
I watched,

776
00:50:49.971 --> 00:50:52.550
I watched all these concert footage people sent me.
I am,

777
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:57.710
I have zero the e street band or Bruce Willis is blues band.

778
00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:02.300
Well,
honestly,
I would Steven see gals,
blues band,

779
00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:07.100
I would probably go see so golf first just because I'm so amused by him.

780
00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:08.980
Okay,
well then let's change that.
Yeah.

781
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:13.730
Bruce Willis and his blues band or the East street band.

782
00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:16.850
And you got to say for the whole show,
you got to take your seat.

783
00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:21.590
You got to watch every song.
Well,
I already have disdain for the e street band.

784
00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:26.630
Okay.
So I would at least go into Willis has banned like,
well,

785
00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:31.410
you know,
maybe I'll,
maybe I'll be an entertainer.
Let's do Sinatra.
Yeah.

786
00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:36.500
Or e street band.
Go.
Mm.
I would see Sinatra.

787
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:40.060
Okay.
Wow.
Wow.
So,
okay.
Uh,

788
00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:44.030
east street band or are you too oh,
definitely.
Go see you said you like them?
No,

789
00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.490
I mean I like them enough that they don't have,

790
00:51:46.491 --> 00:51:51.491
I'm not like a fan where I have all their shit but like him enough and I bet

791
00:51:51.681 --> 00:51:54.110
it's a really good show.
I put the,
I mean like show wise.

792
00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:59.830
What about metal death metal or east street band e street band.

793
00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:07.580
I hate death metal.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's rough.
What do,
wait,
what would you choose?

794
00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:11.810
I mean I think eastern band just because a death metal show would give me so

795
00:52:11.811 --> 00:52:14.720
much it would shut me down.
What about personal death?

796
00:52:14.721 --> 00:52:17.750
Metal or youtube?

797
00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:23.480
Uh,
you too.
Cause that's the show like you said,
like at least it's a,

798
00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:24.710
they put on a grand.

799
00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:30.050
What about you two or you before you had to say to you 40.

800
00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:33.380
Yeah,
I know you hate it.
And they play red,
red wine,
right?

801
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:37.220
They open and close with and close with red,
red wine.
God dammit.

802
00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:41.810
Now that is a tough one.
Yeah.
I hate both of them a lot.

803
00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:47.540
How about I hate red,
red wine.
That's how much you hate that.
So.
Absolutely.

804
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:50.570
I love that song.
That's so funny to me.

805
00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:54.440
It doesn't seem like the kind of song where somebody could feel those emotions.

806
00:52:55.470 --> 00:52:59.470
You know,
it doesn't seem like it to me.
But you also have a colder personnel.

807
00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:04.280
It's true.
You know what I hate about red red wine?
I'll tell you why.

808
00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:09.140
The one part,
cause first of all,
it is a remake of a reggae song.
Yeah.

809
00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:14.210
And the fact that it's too fucking dorky white English guys doing it infuriates

810
00:53:14.211 --> 00:53:17.530
me,
number one.
And then there's the rap part of the song.
Yeah.

811
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:19.590
But

812
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:26.570
because I feel like it's a fake reggae breakdown.
It's not that.

813
00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:31.080
It's not like a teacher doing around.
Yeah.
You know,
geometry or something.

814
00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:35.620
Yeah.
It's a fake flavor.
It's art.

815
00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:37.760
It's triangle.
Oh fuck.

816
00:53:37.790 --> 00:53:41.550
But like when they do connect with the kids,

817
00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:45.140
write a rap about safety first guys.
Yeah.

818
00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:49.140
You got to look both ways before crossing the street.
Yes.
Super.

819
00:53:49.141 --> 00:53:53.220
Super lame,
Bro.
I don't like it.
Oh,
you know what else we both hate?

820
00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:58.650
Oh,
southwestern things.
Oh,
thematically,

821
00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:02.820
anything sounded like the aesthetic theme of like,
Oh,

822
00:54:02.821 --> 00:54:05.040
this is a southwest decor.
No,

823
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:08.400
it's interesting that we both really don't like that.

824
00:54:08.401 --> 00:54:13.110
That's one of the fusion Rez.
I'm not interested in at all.
Anything southwestern.

825
00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:16.530
I don't like southwestern tastes like,
like their food even.

826
00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:20.130
And I've had it a lot because I've been through those regions.

827
00:54:20.131 --> 00:54:23.460
I don't like their version of Mexican food.
It's too different for me.

828
00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:28.790
I don't like,
I like soap a PS.
I do like those.
I will say that.
Oh,

829
00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:33.510
I hate that shit.
This Palo fuck that pillow.

830
00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:38.220
Yeah.
What is it about fuck this shit.
Yeah.
Terrible.
I hate this room.

831
00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:41.580
I want to set it on fire.
I fuck.
I hate it.
Oh,

832
00:54:41.581 --> 00:54:46.581
look how ugly that is and know what fucking hate is called Navajo.

833
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:52.180
No,
but I mean like doing that like that as a,
making a pattern.
Like,

834
00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:56.100
isn't there like a theme dude?
I'm selling wilted.
Is that,
you know what I mean?

835
00:54:56.410 --> 00:55:00.570
It's like a,
yeah,
a tapestry tap.
Is that what that's called?
I Dunno.

836
00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:05.560
That's not southwest son thing.
You know what?

837
00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:10.440
I really hate our fucking dream.
Catchers like this is like,
oh no.

838
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:12.120
You know what I hate most horns,

839
00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:16.940
horns or lamps and like a dream catchers.
Imagine every home

840
00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:23.880
downtown Albuquerque.
I've been there.
I have,
I,
I found the show down there,

841
00:55:23.881 --> 00:55:27.510
that hitchhiker show.
I spent a while in Albuquerque.

842
00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:31.680
I think I actually want to go do a show in Albuquerque.
Yeah,
it's good.
It's good.

843
00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:36.930
Um,
but then just tell him how much I hate come.
That is garbage.

844
00:55:36.931 --> 00:55:37.860
Do that for 10 minutes.

845
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.070
I just want to tell you how much I hate the way things look here.

846
00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:47.690
I don't like turquoise either.
The stone,
I don't know.
I feel like southwest,
um,

847
00:55:48.330 --> 00:55:53.100
like style for Bolo tie string ties.
Hello.

848
00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:56.710
Think so.
I hate those fucking suck.
Yeah.

849
00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:01.890
Now the people are wonderful.
Yeah,
we're not,
I'm not putting down the,
you know,

850
00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:06.260
it's just this,
the style.
I'm not interested.
Yeah,
that is interested.

851
00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:09.370
That is a dog shit.
Look that tie.

852
00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:15.080
That is horrible.
Terrible.
Bolo.
Bolo tie this thing to this garbage.

853
00:56:15.081 --> 00:56:17.790
It has that bullshit design on the pendant.

854
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:22.320
It's all like Navajo stuff.
Fucking terrible.
I mean,

855
00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:24.250
oh God got

856
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:28.780
<v 4>really bad.
Oh,
you're right.
It is like Navajo.
It's Indian stuff.</v>

857
00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:32.890
I'm sorry.
Native American.
Sorry.
Native.
Well guess what?

858
00:56:32.891 --> 00:56:37.030
Natives native.
He's got full neck tats and the bullet.

859
00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:40.800
Well you see that's when you're a Badass.
He's a white boy.
Yup.
Actually no,

860
00:56:40.810 --> 00:56:42.400
this is a total hipster.
Yeah.

861
00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:46.600
Hipster that has adopted the Bolo Western style.

862
00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:51.070
Like he's rocking you pull it off.
Yeah.
It was quite doing it.
It's really ugly.

863
00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:55.690
Yeah.
I think,
um,
I think I would prefer that we had,
uh,

864
00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:59.050
not just massacred the people,

865
00:56:59.051 --> 00:57:01.650
but that style too because that's really bad.

866
00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:05.710
When we handed them the blankets full of the POCs,

867
00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:10.000
we should have also ripped their bolo ties off their fucking stupid fucking tie

868
00:57:10.001 --> 00:57:14.890
off.
Yeah.
Really.
I'll give me your fucking dream catchers too.
I don't like it.

869
00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:19.200
It's not cool.
It's neat though to find things you mutually hate apple.

870
00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:22.240
I don't know if we hate anything quite that much together.

871
00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:24.670
Southwestern's our big one.
I know we both hate,

872
00:57:24.850 --> 00:57:27.170
I mean we have different preferences in shows and we will,

873
00:57:27.171 --> 00:57:30.910
we'll find that's when it's exciting to watch a show together because separately

874
00:57:30.911 --> 00:57:35.650
we have watched last night at watch that kidnapping.
Did you learn anything?

875
00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:39.920
Yeah,
it was really fucking intense.
But how to kidnap or how to be a hustle.

876
00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:44.890
I watched the first episode of that,
uh,
hostage to show it on Netflix.

877
00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:46.250
It was about,
uh,

878
00:57:46.251 --> 00:57:51.251
the Lucasville prison riots and how the prisoner took over and held the guards

879
00:57:52.211 --> 00:57:56.140
captive and it was mainly,
that doesn't happen a lot.

880
00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:58.510
It's so terrifying what happened there.

881
00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:01.990
And they have so much footage and photos of it and the,

882
00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:05.770
and the testimony that um,
you can't help but be,

883
00:58:05.830 --> 00:58:10.830
you realize that has to be literally one of the worst imaginable things is what

884
00:58:11.831 --> 00:58:16.030
happened there,
which is super,
super violent guys.

885
00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:21.400
I'm like the worst of the worst guys take over a prison.

886
00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:27.080
They murdered a bunch of like,
like it was a bunch of retaliation that,
you know,

887
00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:31.960
like scores were settled amongst prisoners first,
then they,

888
00:58:32.170 --> 00:58:34.780
which is interesting that they prioritize that way.

889
00:58:34.930 --> 00:58:38.980
So you mean to tell me they kidnapped the guards?
Well,
at first they couples,

890
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:44.270
couple guards were like beaten down and then within moments one of the prisoners

891
00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:52.870
got to the control board,
opened all the,
the,
you know,

892
00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:58.420
whatever the cells,
and they started riding up in the midst of the riot.

893
00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:02.370
Prisoners were killing other prisoners.
Right?

894
00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:06.250
Like they're like that guy wanted to do something.

895
00:59:07.070 --> 00:59:11.200
Now you'd think that your priority is a prisoner when there's a moment is to

896
00:59:11.201 --> 00:59:15.370
escape that you would go,
look,
the buttons have been pushed.
We're at the control,

897
00:59:15.371 --> 00:59:20.200
but,
well,
yeah,
it's interesting.
I mean,
yeah,

898
00:59:20.201 --> 00:59:23.870
they,
they murdered nine other prisoners were murdered within this

899
00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:27.800
prison and then they kinda,

900
00:59:27.810 --> 00:59:32.810
they tied up the guards and then they had like a list of demands and the

901
00:59:33.861 --> 00:59:36.590
prisoner,
the prison was trying to negotiate with them.

902
00:59:36.830 --> 00:59:41.690
Here's one thing that was interesting.
There's a manual that the,

903
00:59:41.691 --> 00:59:42.170
uh,

904
00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:47.170
prison has about how to negotiate with prisoners if there's ever a situation

905
00:59:48.201 --> 00:59:50.060
like this and the prisoners found it.
Yeah.

906
00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:51.073
<v 9>Oh,</v>

907
00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:52.040
<v 4>you're kidding.</v>

908
00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:55.880
So they were the negotiator that the prisoner that the prison used,

909
00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:59.450
like the actual prisoner reading the manual.
Hilarious.

910
00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:02.660
And knew when they were doing tactics.
Hilarious.

911
01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:05.930
Um,
anyways,

912
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:10.990
so they're trying to stall because the whole idea of the negotiation tactic that

913
01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:14.750
the administration was using was to basically break them down.

914
01:00:14.751 --> 01:00:18.320
So they cut off electricity,
cut off the water,
and it was like,
wear them down.

915
01:00:18.321 --> 01:00:21.980
That's how you'll win this negotiation.
Hm.
The guy goes,
I know what you're doing.

916
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:25.880
They have all the wow 40 calls.
And he's like,

917
01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:30.380
I know what you're fucking doing.
Stolen and saying my name over and over.

918
01:00:30.381 --> 01:00:34.610
I know that shit it,
and then he said like,

919
01:00:34.611 --> 01:00:37.610
if you don't fucking like whatever,

920
01:00:37.611 --> 01:00:40.520
meet this demand in three and a half hours,
we're going to kill a guard.

921
01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:46.220
And Oh my God,
uh,
at the,
whatever the administration,

922
01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:49.580
the police didn't believe him and they were like,
we got to do it.

923
01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:51.930
So they killed a guard.
Whoa.

924
01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:55.710
And then they tossed his body out on the,
on the yard.

925
01:00:56.990 --> 01:01:00.200
Shit,
I just asked that.
But then you know,
these guys,

926
01:01:00.201 --> 01:01:02.660
the other guys that didn't get killed,
the guards,

927
01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:07.750
they were held captive there for nine days.
Imagine that.
Well,

928
01:01:07.751 --> 01:01:12.320
like hardcore pedophiles,
murderers,
rapists,
murderers,
rapists,
really,

929
01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:16.950
really savage dudes.
And he said like the mine stuff,
like the mind games,

930
01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:21.020
like one guy had an aluminum bat and he would just tap it on the ground.

931
01:01:21.021 --> 01:01:22.970
He was like,
we're going to split your head all over that.

932
01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:28.820
And he would tap it at different rates to kind of,
you know.
Yeah.

933
01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:33.010
There's not enough money in the world to get me to work in a prison.
Oh,
I know.

934
01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:37.510
I know.
I'd,
I'd rather collect,
I don't know,
dirty diapers.

935
01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:42.280
I'd rather smell your butt all day.
Yeah.
And that beam God,
this water so good.

936
01:01:42.281 --> 01:01:46.060
Where's your water?
I kind of feel like that.
Where's your water?

937
01:01:46.061 --> 01:01:51.061
Last few moments have been so entertaining that we need to find something

938
01:01:51.251 --> 01:01:53.920
boring.
Where's your water?
You know,
where's your water

939
01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:54.690
<v 9>language from?</v>

940
01:01:54.690 --> 01:01:58.900
An international continues to ship screen saver machines all around the world.

941
01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:05.090
We recently delivered a screen saver Max machine to one of our newest customers.

942
01:02:05.091 --> 01:02:08.090
True concrete solutions located in Michigan.

943
01:02:08.810 --> 01:02:12.770
What is unique about this delivery is that most of our customers take a somewhat

944
01:02:12.771 --> 01:02:17.080
more these boring videos with our new machine fighters.

945
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:22.170
Sean Richardson has extremely hard working crew of seven guys.

946
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:24.230
The voiceovers buying us.

947
01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:28.410
They decided that they would take the Lord in the screen saver Max machine in

948
01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:31.230
place.
1400 yards of concrete.
Oh my God.

949
01:02:31.231 --> 01:02:35.190
I'm going to kill my daughter feet the first day of machine delivery and an

950
01:02:35.191 --> 01:02:39.900
additional 30,000 square.
Okay,
we got it.
You got it?
I got it.
It's fucking boring.

951
01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:44.280
Well,
I'm not bored.
No.
Boom.
Operated high production screen saver.

952
01:02:44.281 --> 01:02:49.200
Max Machine approved.
Kriens same machine for this massive agricultural pit job.

953
01:02:50.110 --> 01:02:54.090
The 4,500 pounds Max arrived at the job site.

954
01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.040
Trailer competent,

955
01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:01.080
allowing the guy into the pit on a fan based ramp that would have been

956
01:03:01.081 --> 01:03:05.610
prohibitive to a machine delivered on a semi truck truck.
I can't combination.

957
01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:07.710
Thank you,
Tom.
We can shut it off now.
Okay,

958
01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:10.090
<v 4>well it's just,
you know,</v>

959
01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.790
sometimes you don't believe that something could be wrong.

960
01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:15.370
<v 9>Boring.
We'd like to dig it up.
Find it for you.</v>

961
01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:20.660
Look Kuboto 35 horsepower diesel engine combined with the considerable screen

962
01:03:20.690 --> 01:03:22.240
has done,
boom,

963
01:03:22.241 --> 01:03:26.940
operated machine resulted in handling slumps that ranged from three to six

964
01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:30.750
<v 4>something too.
We had the um,</v>

965
01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:35.670
the you that thing you emailed me.
I should bring that up.
Yes.
Oh my God.

966
01:03:35.671 --> 01:03:38.940
It's so great.
Well,
there's two things I emailed you that I want you to play.

967
01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:43.530
Yeah,
that's right.
The first one.
Oh yeah,
you got it.
Dad boner.
Yeah.

968
01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:48.480
So good.
So great.
It was sent in a few times.
So people really like this one.

969
01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:51.000
This is so good.
We've been,
you know,

970
01:03:51.001 --> 01:03:53.760
we've been doing dad Boehner clips for awhile.

971
01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:58.100
<v 9>Well,
glass and dads.</v>

972
01:03:59.590 --> 01:04:04.570
<v 4>Yeah,
glad it all started with glasses,
glass.
And um,
now we have,</v>

973
01:04:05.110 --> 01:04:08.440
uh,
a dad that is glassing

974
01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:12.180
<v 10>about the train,
about this specific train.</v>

975
01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:16.290
This is from really excited.
Yeah.
I mean listen to how excited.

976
01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:21.930
Ah,
I've been waiting for this moment for months and it's finally here

977
01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:24.091
<v 4>by the way.</v>

978
01:04:24.091 --> 01:04:27.790
It's just right now he's seeing a train about to leave a train station.
Yeah,

979
01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:30.540
yeah,
yeah.
And that's,
that is all he seen.

980
01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:34.110
So as the bell is ringing,
like it's about to take off.

981
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:36.120
<v 9>Ah,
AH,</v>

982
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:41.280
<v 10>probably going to get a heritage unit on camera.
Yeah.</v>

983
01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:46.640
Oh,
look at that.
1953 eight.

984
01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:52.980
Oh yeah.
Listen to that bell.
Yeah.
Alyssa,

985
01:04:52.981 --> 01:04:55.110
that bell.
Oh,
take a look at that.

986
01:04:56.730 --> 01:04:57.990
Oh my God.

987
01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.010
She's beautiful.

988
01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:09.283
All by

989
01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:17.880
all
the SNC 52.

990
01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:22.840
Oh my God.
Oh,
we're going to watch this.
Oh,

991
01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:26.500
this is Sabash all this a smash off.

992
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:31.690
Well,
it gives me the chills.
Not chills,

993
01:05:31.691 --> 01:05:36.691
have absolutely nothing to do with how cold it is here.

994
01:05:38.770 --> 01:05:43.600
But that doesn't stop a foamer.
Especially when it comes to heritage equipment.

995
01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:49.300
Ah,
this is fantastic.
This is so horrible.
Oh my goodness.

996
01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.790
I would rather that I would cry

997
01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:56.500
<v 4>to make you sleep with this guy.
Oh No.
Yeah.
I don't know.</v>

998
01:05:56.620 --> 01:06:01.330
I would love that to happen.
You know,
like,
just as punishment.
Oh,
fuck.

999
01:06:01.331 --> 01:06:03.520
Got Super Funny.
As really crazy.

1000
01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:07.240
It's good to have something to get the stoke about,
you know?
Yeah.
He's um,

1001
01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:09.670
he's really stoked.
Stoked.
Hmm.
Um,

1002
01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.370
I don't get that excited about anything in life.

1003
01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:16.420
I love on these dads get super pumped about dumb shit.
I know.

1004
01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:20.770
So we've had whale guy cut him loose and of course our hunter at first.

1005
01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:25.480
Um,
yeah,
the hunter guy.
Who was the other one?
I'm glassing.
No,
no.
The other one.

1006
01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:29.620
There's a new one.
Last week I had my brain has gone there.
You the whales,

1007
01:06:29.621 --> 01:06:32.930
the whales.
We talked the wells and that was,
it was after that.
Uh,

1008
01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:37.980
I don't remember now.
You don't remember?
I don't remember anymore.
Oh my bro.

1009
01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:41.380
I have mom brain,
I forget what I even solar eclipse that distillery.

1010
01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:42.800
That's what it was.

1011
01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:47.600
<v 1>Oh yeah,
no,
the diamond crowning.
Oh my God.</v>

1012
01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:55.920
Oh my God.
Little streamers look at the column to the prominence.
Prominences

1013
01:06:56.810 --> 01:07:01.450
<v 4>prominence is leading the Chroma.
The train guy.
Steamers seemed,</v>

1014
01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:02.650
uh,

1015
01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:07.300
I think to be even way more excited than any of these other dads.

1016
01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:09.940
Yeah.
He really lost his load,

1017
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:13.750
seeing those boring ass training and hearing the horn because here's the thing.

1018
01:07:13.751 --> 01:07:15.340
And then he tried to come up with like a,

1019
01:07:15.341 --> 01:07:18.010
a sports caster is called about it and he was like,
the chills.

1020
01:07:18.590 --> 01:07:22.240
I have nothing to do with the weather outside like that.
That's what,
you know,

1021
01:07:22.241 --> 01:07:25.540
like a broadcast extra dad flavor on it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think the,

1022
01:07:25.550 --> 01:07:27.190
and also for me personally,

1023
01:07:27.191 --> 01:07:32.191
I understand getting excited about an eclipse or the whales or catching a moose

1024
01:07:32.830 --> 01:07:36.370
hunting and moose.
But yeah,
the train was kind of like,
okay bro,

1025
01:07:36.371 --> 01:07:41.180
you ain't seen trains before?
Well he's obviously a train enthusiast.
Yes.

1026
01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:44.890
Yeah.
Really fucking likes trains.
It's ridiculous.

1027
01:07:45.930 --> 01:07:50.440
So great.
Um,
yeah,
there's,
I love these excited dads.
I know.

1028
01:07:50.450 --> 01:07:54.600
I like it too.
I like,
oh,
it's just glass and quick.

1029
01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:59.630
Just glass.
Glass,
glass caught a moose.

1030
01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:04.690
He please play.
Oh,
okay.
Twitter today.
Yeah.
I've been dying.

1031
01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:09.330
Listen to it again.
Yeah.
There's this guy.
Yeah.

1032
01:08:09.370 --> 01:08:11.260
I wanted to save the excitement about it,

1033
01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:16.920
so you guys know that the hey mommy and thanks genes obviously have been hugely

1034
01:08:17.781 --> 01:08:18.980
popular.
Uh,

1035
01:08:18.981 --> 01:08:23.580
we get literally fucking dozens every day.
It's a movement.

1036
01:08:24.030 --> 01:08:25.190
Yeah.
Um,

1037
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:30.550
but today a guy sent in one and a,

1038
01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:35.210
and I'm trying to pull this up.
Here it is here.

1039
01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:40.670
This guy is in a car,
his name is jet ski.

1040
01:08:40.671 --> 01:08:45.671
Jeff and he's in an Uber Uber and he decides to just use like show topics,

1041
01:08:50.271 --> 01:08:54.410
like little talking points in his conversation with the Uber driver.

1042
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:57.140
It's so ridiculous.

1043
01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:58.473
<v 11>And with volume</v>

1044
01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:06.670
there hindsight and uh,
we're just going to go,
uh,
we're going to go golf.

1045
01:09:06.671 --> 01:09:07.930
You know what I mean?
We're going to do them.
Hitler.

1046
01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:12.590
<v 4>We're going to do it for him.
We're going to do it for Hitler.</v>

1047
01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:18.530
So crazy.
If you're the driver to hear that there were going to do for Hitler.

1048
01:09:19.790 --> 01:09:21.730
<v 11>One time my mom asked me if she would,</v>

1049
01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:41.500
she told me she,

1050
01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:56.860
<v 4>it is what it is.
I guess this is so not true.</v>

1051
01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:00.460
My favorite part of that,

1052
01:10:00.461 --> 01:10:03.460
part of the thing is just that he's eating and he's just like having,

1053
01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:07.180
my mom was like,
Yo,
what'd you date me?
I was like,
oh,
maybe I would say my mom,

1054
01:10:07.230 --> 01:10:08.063
you know?

1055
01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:13.610
<v 11>No,
I was like,
maybe I would do</v>

1056
01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:27.240
it is what it is.

1057
01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:36.560
And she wanted somebody who was a little too hard,

1058
01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:42.630
<v 4>absolute nonsense.
Gibberish.
It's like,
what are you talking?</v>

1059
01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:55.580
<v 11>Oh,
okay.</v>

1060
01:10:58.330 --> 01:11:02.700
But one of the main things we love doing the Jersey is pup play.

1061
01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:13.000
It's not like a sexual thing,
but like people just like Joseph,
like dogs.

1062
01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:18.300
It's fun.
It's a lot.
She said it's one a day,
one a day.

1063
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:21.680
There's a lot of pup play going on.
I'm like,
no,

1064
01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.540
we're dressed up like dogs and we'll just see how it just have fun.

1065
01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:29.040
Sometimes you gone come runs.

1066
01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:35.160
It's a core part of the public.
It is what it is.
It is what it is.

1067
01:11:38.010 --> 01:11:40.520
You figure out who's,
who's the most line tight,

1068
01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:46.380
who's the most hydrated and it's
wow.

1069
01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:50.270
Yeah,
it's back here.
She's telling you this is what we use

1070
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:53.100
<v 2>story for sure.
Yeah.
It's just like what this guy was talking about.</v>

1071
01:11:53.101 --> 01:11:55.520
Camera says again,
date his mom

1072
01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:59.420
<v 11>do,
they're in Jersey.
Yeah.
Stay hydrated.</v>

1073
01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:07.490
That's what we do.
We're at top golf right now and uh,

1074
01:12:07.491 --> 01:12:10.160
we're just gonna,
we're gonna glass here.

1075
01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:15.060
<v 2>It's so ridiculous.
Really Great.
Jeff.
Good job.</v>

1076
01:12:15.061 --> 01:12:19.980
Jet Ski Jaffa had us laugh and that really made us laugh hard.
He's like,

1077
01:12:19.981 --> 01:12:24.900
you know,
one day my mom,
you know,
she,
I was like,
oh,
maybe I would,
you know,

1078
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:28.970
ask them,
will you ever date your mom?
Um,
wow.

1079
01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:32.850
This water is so fresh and clean.
Where's your water?
You keep asking.

1080
01:12:32.851 --> 01:12:36.530
Where's your water?
A bunch came in.
Oh,
hi mommy.
Thanks jeans.

1081
01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:39.000
You want to see something?
Yeah,
of course.
Okay.
Favorite segment.

1082
01:12:39.690 --> 01:12:42.990
<v 0>Good morning.
Welcome to Starbucks.
Can I get any recommend filling for you today?</v>

1083
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:45.380
<v 12>Hi Mommy.
I'm glass and God blesses him Nigga.</v>

1084
01:12:45.381 --> 01:12:49.850
You know what I'm doing what I'm saying.
Can I get,
um,
a succulent Chinese meal?

1222
01:22:20.441 --> 01:22:23.890
it seems like everybody who's on the other end of that goes like,

they understand that one there,

but it's really interesting.

1226
01:22:32.110 --> 01:22:34.960
But you would never think that you will have a shirt for that.

1227
01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:38.120
I don't think we're going to be selling that.
People have asked and I'm like,
