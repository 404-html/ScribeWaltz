101
00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:13.940
The NBA teams collectively spent 1.7 billion signing damn players.

102
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:18.620
1.7 bill.
Did the Lakers get good people?
No.

103
00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:23.550
It's Corinne playing cream creams back.

Oh Wow.

105
00:08:27.871 --> 00:08:31.860
Condrey guys you've never heard of.

108
00:08:39.261 --> 00:08:44.100

Um,

113
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:05.920
the girl who he,
he brought her back with the ring as well as the story.

114
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.630
Don't like her.
Really?
Yeah.
That's the story.

115
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.470
I wonder what his dad got really upset when he found out she was,

116
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.790
he was marrying a Hispanic girl.
Oh,

There are multicultural.
The Kobe's they,

118
00:09:21.631 --> 00:09:24.240
he was raised in Italy,
Italy.
I know that.

119
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.120
That's all I know about him is he was like this European,

120
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.920
a phenom.
Right.
They should be more open minded

121
00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:38.040
now.
I know.
Sure.
There's more to it than that.
Well,
that was,
that was,
you know,

122
00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.960
he had a really tumultuous relationship with his family the last Kobe.

123
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:48.000
Yeah.
Hmm.
Yeah.
They weren't close.
Interesting.
What did he say to you about it?

124
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.310
Well,
via text or over the phone,
cause it's different stuff.
I mean,

125
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.720
this is well known.
I'm not making this stuff up.
Oh,
I'm not,

126
00:09:54.721 --> 00:09:57.090
I don't think you are.
Yeah.
No,
it's well known stuff.
Okay.

127
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.373

Kobe,
I love that.
Oh,
I remember this.</v>

129
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.910
Sit here for you guys.
He was so broken up over this God pork.

130
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.300
I know.
A suffering man.

131
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.840
Furious at myself.
Yeah.
It's kind of a delay on the sound.
A little bit

132
00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:26.450
disgusted at myself.
He's so handsome.
Good looking guy.

133
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:32.070
He stuck it in some girl in Colorado.
Yeah.
And,
and so,
and then what happened?

134
00:10:32.071 --> 00:10:36.130
So the wife found out it was a big deal.
Well,
it wasn't just the way fat.
No,

135
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.860
I think the girl accused him of rape.
I remember now.

136
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:44.600
Sorry about that.
I forget the stories.
It was so long ago,
you know,

137
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.960
I think she gives him a rape because of how bad are the biggest most he was

138
00:10:49.971 --> 00:10:53.930
after that,
you know.
Uh Huh.
Could you a picture,
is that the technical,

139
00:10:53.931 --> 00:10:57.460
is that what the court said?
What kind of Dick this guy has got it.
Oh,
for sure.

140
00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.470
Kobe's carrion.
Oh my God.
Jesus Christ.

141
00:11:00.471 --> 00:11:05.110
The Salami on this guy talking about assault rifles.
Salami.
Yeah.

142
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:08.130
Look at the wife.
She's just like,
she looked at me,
mother fucker.

143
00:11:08.131 --> 00:11:10.370
I'm going to get a ring.
I'm going to get a fucking bracelet.

144
00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:15.590
You know Lamborghini.
Oh yeah,
we got her to fucking always person.

145
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.920
Personal counting right now.
Yeah.

146
00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:24.410
I'm so sorry.
Did they have kids together?
Yeah.
Oh Shit.

147
00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.130
I don't know if they had them at this point.
It's not listened to.
Poor Kobe.

148
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:32.580
I don't think he's up.
Do you think he was he proven to the no.
Yeah.

149
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:36.440
I don't think that guy seems sweet.
I think it

150
00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.820
<v 3>comes with the territory.
If you play in the NBA.
I think so.
Yeah.
They're like,</v>

151
00:11:40.821 --> 00:11:44.990
get your deck ready and get it out because this is going to do a lot of stuff.

152
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.160
Right.
Well you're not just training to play basketball here.

153
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:53.700
You're going to do a lot of fucking guys the most ball too.
But yeah.

154
00:11:53.701 --> 00:11:57.010
But I think more football or basketball basket.
Why do you think that is?

155
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.690
I think it's just like the short shorts,
you know?

156
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:05.740
First of all there's less.
You're not actually physically wrecked.

157
00:12:05.741 --> 00:12:09.600
Usually after a basketball game going can be tired,
but you're not like,

158
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:14.130
I think my shoulder broke and like,
you know,
so,
yeah.
Yeah.

159
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:17.860
And that's true,
that culture of like at a game,

160
00:12:17.861 --> 00:12:21.750
like the environment is a little more,
I dunno.
I think,
yeah,

161
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.920
it's like a social thing.
Nicholson comes to the games,

162
00:12:25.921 --> 00:12:28.150
celebrities sit on the whatever.

163
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:32.180
It's an exciting thing to go to the shooting hoops and he going to take a shower

164
00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:36.060
and going go,
fuck yeah.
What about tennis ball?
Your Lens?

165
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:40.270
I'm gonna have surgery right now and there there was a carried off on stretchers

166
00:12:40.271 --> 00:12:43.540
or where was that?
Tennis.
Those guys must throw it around the most.

167
00:12:43.541 --> 00:12:46.180
Then they probably thought it out and I feel like they're always tennis.

168
00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.190
Big tennis stars are usually in relationships.

169
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.440
I feel like basketball's away more.

170
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:54.520
You know the thing is basketball for a while that you could jump in the NBA from

171
00:12:54.521 --> 00:12:56.080
high school.
So guys were coming in,

172
00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:02.990
guys come in as teenagers and there's all this money and they're traveling every

173
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:07.120
night.
It's not like football.
There's 16 games,
basketball,
there's 82 is,

174
00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:09.220
I didn't know that.
Yeah.
So it's like,
you know,

175
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:14.620
it's a long season and it's a smaller group so they get usually tighter.

176
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:18.580
You know,
you have a smaller group of people who become friends and I think it's,

177
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:23.630
it's the environment is also more into like the nightclub and you know that

178
00:13:24.101 --> 00:13:28.600
going out like that,
that's bigger in the NBA.

179
00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:33.310
Gotcha,
Gotcha.
Interesting.
Yeah.
Interesting.
Just like Comedians,

180
00:13:33.311 --> 00:13:35.600
same thing.
Yeah,
totally.
Man.

181
00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:40.000
Comedian should be way more irresponsible than we are.

182
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.760
Like we kind of hold it together more than most people don't.

183
00:13:42.761 --> 00:13:46.720
We compared to the NBA.
What comedians are you talking first of all,

184
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.230
what's that football player?
You and Aja,

185
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.060
we're talking about that guy that has like 40 kids.

186
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:57.600
There's a fee one who's notoriously oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

187
00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.470
Antonio Cromartie yeah,
we've played them on the show.
Right.

188
00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:04.470
But I'm saying like Louis C K doesn't have 12 children.

189
00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:08.650
We don't have a lot of money.
Now I know what come on.
I mean,
no,

190
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.470
but it's not just football.
That's sport.
I mean basketball players.

191
00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:14.770
There's baseball guys too that have that a lot of basketball and football

192
00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:15.604
players.

193
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.490
The guy that like first brought that whole um,

194
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:25.690
you know,
phenom that that idea on into the,

195
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.570
into the culture was a basketball player.

196
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:33.690
Sports illustrated did a piece on a player named Shawn Kemp back in the early

197
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.660
nineties cause he had seven kids in like seven different cities.

198
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:42.100
Like it was all on his basketball schedule whenever teams

199
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.680
and everyone was like seven kids.
It's crazy once you know,

200
00:14:47.681 --> 00:14:51.980
it is pretty outrageous since then it's gone numbers for other people.

201
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.810
<v 5>I've gone way up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Isn't it?</v>

202
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:58.460
Isn't it interesting now that we have a child and don't you feel like the 19

203
00:14:58.461 --> 00:15:02.660
kids and counting woman is the most reckless or a piece of human shit?

204
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.520
The Duggar's,

205
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.790
the Duggar's think it's so irresponsible and it was even more reckless.

206
00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:12.290
So blame it on religion to be like,
well,

207
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.690
if old JC didn't want me to have one of these,
you know,

208
00:15:14.691 --> 00:15:17.960
he just stopped letting me have him.
God invented birth control too.
Right?

209
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:20.330
Well that's the,
that's that's considered sacrilege.

210
00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:24.230
That's so offensive to everybody to just say,

211
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.190
we're going to drain the system.
Like the bird

212
00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:33.430
<v 3>of each of these.
He lives on this world and the excuse is just like,</v>

213
00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:36.310
God wouldn't let me have these if I wasn't supposed to.

214
00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:39.540
<v 5>Those nut bags are part of a movement called quiver fall.</v>

215
00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:44.280
And really basically what they're doing is populating enough of themselves to

216
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.001
eventually,

217
00:15:45.001 --> 00:15:49.350
the goal is to get them into government positions and to be public leaders and

218
00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:54.210
to crave more nuts basically.
You know,
it's what the Catholics do to,

219
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:58.920
we create a lot of nuts.
A wage to Kimono.
No,
no,

220
00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:01.480
I like it.
It's very nice.
It's very nice.
The nighttime shows.

221
00:16:01.481 --> 00:16:04.920
So if I were a conservative leader,

222
00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:09.360
I would support that idea because that,
I feel like,
at least here,

223
00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:14.280
<v 3>that the conservatives are definitely behind politically.</v>

224
00:16:14.281 --> 00:16:17.850
They have less stars,
less big names.
Yeah.
You know,

225
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:23.190
<v 5>they are,
they are our nutbag.
So get proven well.
Some of them are not,
not bags.</v>

226
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.630
My thing is that I think

227
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:29.140
<v 3>there's a definite shift where you feel like more,</v>

228
00:16:29.141 --> 00:16:32.050
especially the youth is more progressive,
right?
More liberal.

229
00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.870
So if you're a conservative,
you go like,

230
00:16:34.871 --> 00:16:39.871
we have to find some way to combat this seemingly endless progression of

231
00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.720
progressives.
You know,
and one of the ways you could do is be like,
look,

232
00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:45.580
all you Super Christians,

233
00:16:45.581 --> 00:16:49.630
you got to start fucking lot more having a lot of kids so that at one point

234
00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:53.590
maybe there'll be more of us,
you know their whole thing.
Yeah,
I understand that.

235
00:16:53.591 --> 00:16:58.140
I'm saying it's crazy,
but I understand the thought behind it.
Yeah.

236
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.310
<v 5>Great.
So this video was actually sent by my friend Shawna,</v>

237
00:17:02.311 --> 00:17:05.600
who lives in a sentence.
Well she sent it to me,
I don't know,

238
00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:09.810
blue band also picked it up,
but Shawnee sent this apparently,
and she goes,

239
00:17:09.811 --> 00:17:11.670
look what's happening in my city right now.
Yeah.

240
00:17:11.671 --> 00:17:13.690
This is pretty neat guy taking them.

241
00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:19.190
He's taken shifts is putting it in bags and stuffing that bag into people

242
00:17:19.801 --> 00:17:24.080
shorts.
What does what have been,
especially in the summer.

243
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:28.980
That's gotta be a really special,
you don't get that everyday.
No,
he's not.

244
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:34.260
He doesn't hesitate running up behind an unsuspecting woman and shoving the

245
00:17:34.261 --> 00:17:39.240
waist down her shorts from another angle phone and never sees it coming.

246
00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:42.360
The man gets away.
How disgusting is that?

247
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.350
Yeah.
That's a bold move.
Yeah.
Take your shit.
It's Kinda neat though,
right?
Well,

248
00:17:49.351 --> 00:17:50.010
I wouldn't use

249
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.300
<v 3>my shit of what a fee.</v>

250
00:17:51.301 --> 00:17:54.870
They could do some test and figure out who you are you to go for it.
No,

251
00:17:54.871 --> 00:17:58.680
you want to do that.
I do someone else's shit or dog shit.

252
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.110
I mean your criminal mind is definitely working,

253
00:18:01.111 --> 00:18:05.310
but I feel like the exciting part is to be like you took my shit.
Yeah.

254
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:09.600
I can tell.
I totally get this by the way.
I totally get it.
What a thrill.

255
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:14.520
What assigning groups.
I know it's pretty funny.

256
00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:19.230
He was a prankster.
I think he's a severely mentally ill.

257
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.480
Drifter.
Probably has a couple of murders.
Unders.
No,
no,
no,
no.

258
00:18:24.481 --> 00:18:27.300
This is just college prank.
Eyebrow.

259
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:30.870
You on camera doing this where you took a shit and put it in a baked potato and

260
00:18:30.871 --> 00:18:34.740
put it under some guise pillow.
You did all that.
I didn't the Shanti.

261
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.980
I should in a,
you know what I did?
I shouldn't have Ziploc bag.

262
00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.160
I put it in a pillow.
What's the diff,
you said a baked potato?

263
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.450
Well that's called a shanty.

264
00:18:42.451 --> 00:18:46.530
You've put it in a baked potato and then he puts in foil on it and then you hide

265
00:18:46.531 --> 00:18:48.870
it and the guy's closet.
And then it stinks over time.

266
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.290
Now I learned this from a frat boy that I worked with at a company called world

267
00:18:52.291 --> 00:18:54.180
link.
Okay.
10 years ago,

268
00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:59.490
know what I did was I shit it was a hot,
like a hot five minutes.

269
00:18:59.491 --> 00:19:03.070
Talk about it.
It was a,

270
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:08.540
I think it was coming out of summer into fall was still real hot and I shit into

271
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:13.380
a Ziploc bag.
Now how did you do that?
Let's be,
how did you,

272
00:19:13.381 --> 00:19:16.080
it was one of those ziplocs that actually has the,

273
00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:19.110
it's in a gallon size cause I imagine at one,
yeah,
it was a big one.

274
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:23.460
And then the regular seal,
but the,
you know,
Zoopla?
No,
no,

275
00:19:23.461 --> 00:19:27.240
but the kind you can slide it over.
Yes.
So yeah,
I just,
I was like,

276
00:19:27.241 --> 00:19:28.740
I gotta do it over a toilet.

277
00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:34.360
I got a hot one in me and I stood a squad and I held it open and I was able to,

278
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.050
it was like a real mushy out one.

279
00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:43.030
It kind of plopped in there.
I sealed it up.
Um,

280
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:49.100
Bill Bailey and red shared that were were roommates freshman year of college and

281
00:19:49.201 --> 00:19:53.610
we used to play,
we played some games,
some card game kings,

282
00:19:53.611 --> 00:19:55.480
is that what it was called?
Um,

283
00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:59.190
every Thursday we would play that because that's also in south park would come

284
00:19:59.191 --> 00:20:03.900
on and we,
we uh,
you know,
bills in on it.
I go,

285
00:20:03.901 --> 00:20:07.730
I'll put it in reds pillow and then,
you know,
we'll,

286
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.510
we'll just watch him discover there's a bat shit is.
So anyways,

287
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:18.130
I put it in there and we find out that like reds out of town or red,

288
00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:21.750
red's not coming back.
So we off fuck,
they ain't got the luggage bag.
I know.

289
00:20:21.751 --> 00:20:24.540
So I'm like,
well I guess this,
this whole prank is over,

290
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.260
so I take this shit and I throw it out of the dorm,

291
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.240
like third floor or throw it right.

292
00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.170
And it just lands out in the field somewhere.

293
00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:36.930
And so that's Thursday.

294
00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.220
So Thursday,
Friday,
Saturday,
Sunday,
Monday,
Tuesday,
Wednesday,

295
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:45.840
it's out there.
I figure it's gone.
Red Is back in town.
We'll go,
let's just see.

296
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:50.740
It's there.
It's cooking in the sun.
Take it again.

297
00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:52.000
Put it back in his pillow.

298
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:58.090
Play cards of course were laughing so hard at stupid shit,

299
00:20:58.091 --> 00:21:03.091
but it looks like we're laughing at each other's jokes because somebody says

300
00:21:04.781 --> 00:21:08.560
something really mundane and everybody busted out laughing because we're just

301
00:21:08.561 --> 00:21:12.490
thinking about him.
The bag of shit.
Yeah.
You guys don't see dorm rooms or small.

302
00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:16.850
It is the sheer,
no,
we couldn't smell it from there.
So he,

303
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:21.040
but he gets up in the,
he's on the top bunk and then he's like,

304
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:23.740
I'm going to heat this Omaha.
We're like,
all right.

305
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:27.550
Then all of a sudden we're like,
we're counting like one,
two,
three,

306
00:21:27.551 --> 00:21:30.250
and like almost on cue.
Then five seconds he goes,

307
00:21:30.251 --> 00:21:32.810
I'll go change my fucking shoots.
So we're like,

308
00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:36.690
he's like,
oh,
it's drinks.

309
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:41.590
It's starts taking the sheets off and we're just bracing ourselves.
Um,

310
00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:44.950
he takes his pillowcase and he was like,
what the fuck?

311
00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.880
And dumps it over and a bag of shit falls out.

312
00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:55.840
Man.
He was so fucking heated.
He was so upset.
He,

313
00:21:56.050 --> 00:22:00.430
he picked it up and he threw.
And I remember I came right by my face.

314
00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:05.380
Did the ZIP lock bag open?
No,
but you know him and bill went to the Ziploc brand.

315
00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:07.990
It actually should be a Ziploc ad.
I know.

316
00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:11.260
And actually I was hoping that this way might reach some of their people.

317
00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:15.850
You don't know now might this episode of Your Mom's house is brought to you buy

318
00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:20.560
Ziploc shitting in a bag of shit and keep on shit.

319
00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:25.960
So when he threw it,
bill threw it back and it basically was,

320
00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.740
you know,
almost a brawl,
right?
Yes.

321
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:33.100
And somebody definitely ratted on me,
but I,

322
00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:37.570
I was able to deny the charges.

323
00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.970
Who ratted you out was the thing.
I don't know,
but I was like not fungus.

324
00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:45.280
Of course somebody did.
Somebody did.
And it's the only,

325
00:22:45.281 --> 00:22:46.300
they ratted me out probably.

326
00:22:46.301 --> 00:22:49.180
It wasn't probably the inner circle is one of those things where it got out like

327
00:22:49.181 --> 00:22:52.660
Tom Shit.
Guys bragged somebody I didn't get caught.

328
00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:57.970
That's how they always get card.
Denied it for six,
seven years.

329
00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:02.650
Wow.
His wedding.
I told them
what is special.

330
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.050
I told him,
did you whisper in his ear?
I toast.

331
00:23:05.051 --> 00:23:08.060
I gave him a toast and I told them I'm the one that shit in your pillow case.

332
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:13.120
It was like his glass.
What a special gift.
But I love him.

333
00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:14.763
I love him.

334
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:19.060
But say you're saying you understand the logic of the New York shitter and this

335
00:23:19.061 --> 00:23:23.410
is a good idea.
This is very dear to me.
And I read the poop Heil.

336
00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:27.580
Yes.
Do you want to explain to people?
I do.
I don't.

337
00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:29.680
I want youtube because I don't believe you.

338
00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.170
This is one of those stories that you've been trying to sell me on for like,

339
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:37.200
or that's bullshit.
You've been benign.
Yeah.

340
00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:41.620
So such a lie.
I told you that my junior year,

341
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:43.690
um,
CJ,

342
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:49.320
Jay Reed and got an apartment off campus freshman and sophomore year.

343
00:23:50.331 --> 00:23:53.150
We lived on campus junior year we had an apartment senior here.

344
00:23:53.151 --> 00:23:54.530
We moved to another one junior year.

345
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:59.780
It was this really like out in the woods kind of apartment complex,
about 10,

346
00:23:59.781 --> 00:24:01.370
15 minutes away from campus.

347
00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:05.480
And in the summer we live there.

348
00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.630
Justin didn't leave there,
but Casey and I did.

349
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:12.590
And we also had other roommates people,
I dunno,
whatever.

350
00:24:12.591 --> 00:24:13.670
It was a weird neighborhood,

351
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.990
but every other day we would go in the backyard and we built this,

352
00:24:17.991 --> 00:24:20.210
there was a a natural ladder,

353
00:24:20.211 --> 00:24:24.410
but we built like a seat off a ladder and we would take shit from there onto the

354
00:24:24.411 --> 00:24:29.411
ground and the whole idea was build a poop pile so everybody would,

355
00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.100
the neighborhood kids were like,
I want to take your shit there.

356
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:36.540
And we'd let them and then every

357
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:39.350
<v 5>buddy would just,
oh yeah,
I don't believe this.</v>

358
00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:43.610
I know you didn't try to sell me this story.
I think you're lying.
Number one.

359
00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.020
Why would you like this neighborhood kid thing?
Yeah.

360
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:48.830
You just added that fact to it by the way.
No I didn't.
Yeah,
you did.

361
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:52.100
People from all over the apartment complex would shit their,
yeah,
you did.

362
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:55.070
So now this is a new fact that you've been adding.
No,
I didn't.

363
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.150
I've heard the story like a million times something.

364
00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:00.530
I don't fucking listen to details now we will announce when we go.

365
00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.420
This is the London.
Everybody wouldn't mind to try to show.
This is the lie.

366
00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:07.070
That's not a lie.
Not First of all.

367
00:25:07.071 --> 00:25:11.870
People don't line up to take shit when you got it yet.
It's on your time.

368
00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.620
No,
you don't.
Everybody on his shit.
Everybody wanted to poop.

369
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:18.770
This is how I know it's a total life.
Okay,

370
00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.880
I'm going to make you do a polygraph on this series.
How would I make this a man?

371
00:25:22.881 --> 00:25:25.190
Can we look into getting a polygraph test?

372
00:25:25.191 --> 00:25:28.910
Because I've heard the fucking poo pile story now I'm not.

373
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:31.820
I'll since we first started dating,
you tried to convince me.

374
00:25:31.821 --> 00:25:35.100
Justin's tried to convince me.
He's not trying to convince you.

375
00:25:35.101 --> 00:25:38.180
It's telling you this is you guys are in on the stupid stupid line.

376
00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.920
I call them and see if I'm making it up.
Dude,

377
00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:43.100
we've done this before and then he knows the story and then he,

378
00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:47.480
he makes up some shit to the only reason we'd a polygraph.
That's the only way.

379
00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:49.430
By the end of that summer,

380
00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:52.940
<v 3>remember Jurassic Park when they find the dinosaur mountains,</v>

381
00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:58.940
the shit was like that.
It was like a thousand shits in one time.
That is

382
00:25:58.940 --> 00:25:59.151
<v 5>so,</v>

383
00:25:59.151 --> 00:26:04.130
and where was it in relation to your windows and your rooms and stuff is in the

384
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:06.060
backyard.
You guys had it.

385
00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:11.170
A pile of human feces in your backyard is what you're trying to sell me on a

386
00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:15.140
huge,
huge amount.
Nobody would let that.

387
00:26:15.141 --> 00:26:17.090
If you lived in an apartment complex that wouldn't,

388
00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:21.290
you've never lived in North Carolina.
That's where I lived.

389
00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.080
You're telling me that all the people that lived in the apartment complex,

390
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:28.430
we're like,
we like this poop pile.
Then it was,

391
00:26:28.431 --> 00:26:32.960
they're lining up to shit from a ladder until Billy ladder.

392
00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:37.810
They thought it was awesome.
This is total way to shit on it.

393
00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.720
We want the listeners don't know is that you have been trying to sell me this

394
00:26:41.721 --> 00:26:45.300
bullshit story for 11 years and you're the one that brings it up a functionally

395
00:26:45.301 --> 00:26:48.720
retarded in the night believe everything.
If I can say,
oh,
I don't,

396
00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.660
I know you're lying,
lying.

397
00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:55.770
I'm not sure why we should on that thing for a hundred days in a row and sort of

398
00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:00.660
everybody in that complex.
Okay.
There wasn't one person who was like,

399
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.540
I don't want to pile of everyone's shit in my backyard.

400
00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:07.580
There wasn't another woman that was like,
guys,
I'm not so sure.
No,

401
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.000
because smelled the summer and as soon as lies what you disliked it.

402
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:15.350
They didn't tell us so they liked it.
Their kids like shit.

403
00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:19.770
They're saying it as a lie.
No,
it's not.
It's been lying.
Nobody,

404
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.410
nobody ever said,
hey,
we got to stop this.

405
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:26.250
[inaudible] you just added that the whole neighborhood stood in line and the

406
00:27:26.251 --> 00:27:30.460
children were cheering.
When we weld plan,
I like that.

407
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:34.380
Everybody would line up for shit.
The children and they come.
Yes.
Okay.

408
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:35.940
I'm telling you,
it's such a line.

409
00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.130
Sometimes guys would come home from work and they take,

410
00:27:38.131 --> 00:27:41.370
your state would come right there and shit there.
I'm serious.

411
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.580
Polygraph blue man.

412
00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:47.610
Find out how much it'll cost and we're going to do it.

413
00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:52.200
I'm sick of hearing this story for years.
I've been hearing this nonsense.

414
00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:00.960
Anyways,
it's the 4th of July.
It's Americans Hall.

415
00:28:00.961 --> 00:28:04.920
It's my favorite.
I love drinking in public with people.

416
00:28:04.921 --> 00:28:09.921
I love going out with the general public and he's standing in parks and looked

417
00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:12.810
at fireworks.
You don't like 4th of July?
I like,

418
00:28:12.811 --> 00:28:15.180
I like America and I love our independence.

419
00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:19.410
I don't like to go anywhere where there's groups of people drinking,

420
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:23.480
staring at the sky and I've never really been all over me.
I never liked,

421
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:28.740
I never liked the,
uh,
the huge crowds,
but I don't like huge crowds on any day.

422
00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:33.510
Now what I dread is when Elis gets older and he's going to want to see stuff and

423
00:28:33.511 --> 00:28:35.580
then we're going to have to do shit like go see fireworks.

424
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:39.710
Today is also every year the big,
uh,

425
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.810
Nathan's hot dog eating.
Yes.
Most importantly,

426
00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:46.260
it used to be really into this more.
I feel like hot dog eating guns.
This was,

427
00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:49.740
I loved it.
I still do.
But then,
you know,
life took over.

428
00:28:49.741 --> 00:28:53.910
Responsibilities took over.
But I'm of your homeboy was a Kobayashi,
right?

429
00:28:53.911 --> 00:28:57.630
It wasn't your guy.
I love to Curio Kobayashi.
He was my favorite for many,

430
00:28:57.631 --> 00:28:59.640
many years.
He trained really hard.

431
00:28:59.641 --> 00:29:04.290
He's the kind of guy that he would eat cabbage for weeks ahead to expand his

432
00:29:04.291 --> 00:29:08.420
stomach.
He would do a lot of physical exercise to be fit outside,

433
00:29:08.421 --> 00:29:12.210
super foot black widow Sonia at Thomas,

434
00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:17.430
she weighed like 90 pounds.
Little Asian girl.
The Ifo.
See,
I'm a huge fan.

435
00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:23.150
She was good at winks.
She was the wing champion,
right?
I do,

436
00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:26.710
yeah.
I read a book about it.
I,
I'm fascinated.
It's,
it actually started as a,

437
00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:31.590
as a goof obviously.
And then these two guys started the IFO,
see and it became,

438
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:35.070
it became what it is famous.
They have other events,
by the way,

439
00:29:35.071 --> 00:29:38.790
not just hot dog eating.
It was the tip of our hat.
I mean,
it's already over.

440
00:29:38.791 --> 00:29:41.980
But uh,
just before the event,
we have a,

441
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.400
<v 3>this clip from one of the competitors,</v>

442
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.020
Richard Franco check this.
Right,
right.

443
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:52.330
<v 6>Go.
Not just a competitor,
but the favorite to win the hot dog eating contest.</v>

444
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:55.240
It's the most you can eat in five minutes.
So Richard,
I,

445
00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:59.620
how often do you practice for something like,
I know my,
you know,

446
00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.440
my parents might fool you.
I'm,
I'm on.
Been on a giant diet.

447
00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:07.710
<v 3>So,
um,
what's this,
what's that 4th of July?
He's a,</v>

448
00:30:07.711 --> 00:30:11.940
is he,
is he doing sign language?
Big Bird,
all dressed up in American gear?

449
00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:17.460
Horrible.
Richard's obviously,
you know,
he's saying that for the listeners a,

450
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:20.670
he's a big boy,
you know.
Um,
I don't know exactly the number,

451
00:30:20.671 --> 00:30:24.690
but I would say he's probably in the upper three hundreds.
Okay.

452
00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:27.960
Just for the competitive eater.
I don't,
I'm not familiar with his work,

453
00:30:27.961 --> 00:30:30.570
but I'm excited to look him up.
I like to know is Dietz,

454
00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:33.780
but I'm trying to make it clear and so people listening,
but when he says,

455
00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:36.630
you know,
I'm uh,
I might,
my appearance might not.

456
00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:38.720
It's because he's a real big guy.
Right.
Okay.

457
00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:44.180
<v 6>I know my,
you know,
my parents buy it for you.
I'm,
I'm on,</v>

458
00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:48.110
been on a giant diet and life changing stuff.
Um,

459
00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.240
I've dropped to about a hundred pounds in eight months.

460
00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:54.490
<v 3>Good man,
that's crazy.
Was even,
he was a hundred pounds heavier than this.</v>

461
00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:55.913
Good job,

462
00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:59.140
<v 6>Richard.
So we're going to consider this my cheat day for the here,</v>

463
00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:03.250
but you know,
prepping just gallons of water.
But you know,

464
00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:07.800
I have two giant inspirations.
First,
my wife,
second anniversary today.

465
00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:12.790
I want to say hi to her.
And,
um,
there's a comedian I love,
he's a big,

466
00:31:12.791 --> 00:31:16.160
giant fat guy,
just like me,
Bert Chrysler,
and uh,
you know,

467
00:31:16.161 --> 00:31:19.390
and if he can do what I can do it and he's still way bigger than I am.

468
00:31:19.391 --> 00:31:22.200
But you know what,
maybe I can inspire him.
There you go.

469
00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.053
<v 7>It's so good.</v>

470
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:35.710
<v 3>What a wonderful thing.
That was amazing.
What a treat that is.</v>

471
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:41.200
Fat.
Um,
that was so good.
That was so real to,
we didn't,

472
00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:45.370
we didn't ask them to do that or it's not Richard Franco.
Thank you Richard.

473
00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:49.900
I know that you didn't when Nathan's,
but you won our fucking hearts today.

474
00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:55.080
You're the kind of being that is amazing.
I got to tell you.
Um,

475
00:31:55.870 --> 00:32:00.700
you know,
I feel like the way jokes go on the show.
Yeah.

476
00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:03.220
Sometimes you were like,
what happened to this bit?
And it's like,
you know,

477
00:32:03.221 --> 00:32:06.910
it's just like naturally hanging out with your friends.
Things dip away.
Yes.

478
00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:12.240
Am I feeling was this bird thing is going to take the natural dip,

479
00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:16.210
right,
right,
right.
That was just like,
you know,
um,
what's his name,

480
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:21.400
the boxer crazy.
Lokes or right,
right.
Or,
um,
Shane Lee or any,

481
00:32:21.401 --> 00:32:24.190
you know,
or the,
uh,
Friday,
Thursday layers.

482
00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:29.410
Those are the things where like people come up.
Uh,
there's jokes about it.

483
00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:32.950
There's just a natural way that things come up and about.

484
00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:37.420
But I actually feel like as we're thinking this is going to dip down,

485
00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:42.260
I think it's actually going to rev up.
It's gained momentum.

486
00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:46.580
It's gaining momentum because Burt is also now more invested.

487
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:51.350
He was like playing the victim card for a while and now he's like,

488
00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.500
he sent out a tweet that said basically Tom,

489
00:32:54.501 --> 00:32:58.330
brace yourself for what I'm going to do to you.
And he said,

490
00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:02.540
reverse revenge is a best is it?
Is a dish best served cold?

491
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:05.960
And then everyone was like,
of course you're referencing food,
you fat shit.
But,

492
00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:09.620
um,
but I really feel like it's about to actually,

493
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:12.530
I think it's actually gotten bigger than we,

494
00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:17.990
it's because we don't even,
people sometimes will say to us,
Oh,
you know,

495
00:33:17.991 --> 00:33:20.120
you mentioned the Burt jokes again.
And I'm like,
yeah,
dude,

496
00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:24.380
you have no idea how little we're talking about this.
Yeah.
The momentum of it.

497
00:33:24.381 --> 00:33:27.410
It's become its own movement.
It's taken over Wikipedia.

498
00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.410
I think they changed birth.
They trade,
they changed to ride day,

499
00:33:30.411 --> 00:33:32.720
produce Wikipedia page,

500
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.480
Gerard dip our dues Wikipedia page,

501
00:33:35.481 --> 00:33:37.790
at least for a few days last week,

502
00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:42.400
said that he bears an uncanny resemblance to big fat Slob,
communion.

503
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:46.010
Burnt Chrysler,
that is an internationally acclaimed actor.

504
00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:52.680
Burt's Wikipedia page has been,
Jack Burns was completely hijacked.
Um,

505
00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:55.710
things like this.
Like Richard's amazing.

506
00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:00.390
Thank [inaudible] talking about a big fat guy named Bert.

507
00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.800
He has,
he's bigger than me,
is way bigger than me,

508
00:34:03.801 --> 00:34:08.430
but if I can inspire the way Richard does it,
it's perfect.

509
00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:12.000
It's perfect.
You really slid it in.
So naturally it's like my,

510
00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:16.670
my wife knows this guy and then he,
he does it and the,
Oh,
so like,
oh,

511
00:34:16.671 --> 00:34:20.660
okay.
Yeah.
Just masterfully.
He really mastered no prepping,

512
00:34:20.661 --> 00:34:25.130
just gallons of water.
I have two giant inspirations.
First,
my wife,

513
00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.550
it's our second anniversary today.
I want to say hi to her university.
And um,

514
00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:33.200
there's a comedian I love,
he's a big giant fat guy just like me,

515
00:34:33.201 --> 00:34:36.830
Burke Christ lake.
And uh,
you know,
you can do it.
I can do it.

516
00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.880
You still way bigger than I am,
but you know what?
Maybe I can inspire him.

517
00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:45.820
There you go.
He's so sincere,
which really good.

518
00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:46.250
Richard.

519
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:50.720
So earnest and they're having some pictures floating around on Twitter of Bert,

520
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:55.340
like on the travel channel show.
And he really is just enormous right now.

521
00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:59.360
Oh my God.
He really is.
He's actually,
it did,

522
00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:02.420
it was a joke.
And then the pictures,

523
00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:07.490
like somebody took a snapshot of him hosting the show and they,

524
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:10.760
and it was a radio host in Indianapolis and you won't get this,

525
00:35:10.761 --> 00:35:15.110
but sports fans will he go next to birth picture?
He put fat Andrew Luck,

526
00:35:15.111 --> 00:35:18.020
which is the quarterback for the colts.
Burton looks like him,

527
00:35:18.021 --> 00:35:20.720
but like a thousand power.
Yeah.

528
00:35:20.721 --> 00:35:24.170
So people are doing that and then they're doing still shots.
Right.

529
00:35:24.171 --> 00:35:27.890
The screen grabs of him like in that pool where he's like,

530
00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:32.180
he looks like he's 13 months pregnant or like a little kid is just looking

531
00:35:32.181 --> 00:35:35.960
straight at the stomach.
Yeah,

532
00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.100
so I'm also,
I'm actually

533
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:42.120
<v 5>also really,
I'm really interested at what he's got.</v>

534
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:45.670
He's got something planned.
He has done some planning.
Yeah.

535
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.210
I don't think it's as big as this is the biggest thing.

536
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.850
We got this victory with Richard here I think,

537
00:35:50.851 --> 00:35:52.770
and we didn't even plan on prompted.
Yeah.
Prompted.

538
00:35:52.771 --> 00:35:54.600
This is just this guy is brilliant work here.

539
00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:58.560
I feel like you can't really top that.
This dude.
I'm,

540
00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:03.010
I'm waiting and I already have a comeback.
You and I have been talking in,

541
00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:07.710
in private behind closed doors.
Possible retaliation.
I don't,

542
00:36:07.711 --> 00:36:10.530
we're not going to disclose,
disclose it,
but it would,

543
00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:15.600
it'd be mass seriously up the game a lot.
It would be insane.

544
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:19.530
I'm really hoping that we,
well,
let's see.
Let's see what Bert,

545
00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:23.200
he'll throw down the gauntlet and will retaliate if necessary.

546
00:36:23.201 --> 00:36:24.930
I mean I feel like it's an ambush.

547
00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:29.580
That's what I feel like that sweet suggests you're not going to be ready for it

548
00:36:29.581 --> 00:36:32.970
and that's when it's going to get you.
Okay.
Well,
let's see.
It's so funny.

549
00:36:32.971 --> 00:36:35.610
Even my cousin just randomly today was like,
Oh,

550
00:36:35.611 --> 00:36:39.540
I've been looking at Hashtag Burdis fat on Instagram.
Just seeing what there is,

551
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.560
there's tons of shit.
Does that Hashtag Burdis fat?
It's,

552
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:47.640
it's taken over and people have,
I always say it's great.

553
00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:50.790
Most people that listen to this show,
I'll give you credit

554
00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:54.870
or really,
really funny with it.
Oh yeah.

555
00:36:54.871 --> 00:36:59.250
Some people are mean and I feel like sometimes it's like,
it's too mean.
You know,

556
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.690
like I'll send,
I mean I get the tweets too and then I'm like,
Jesus,
like the,

557
00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.900
there'll be really mean.
But some of them are just super well,
like whatever.

558
00:37:06.901 --> 00:37:10.980
Like yeah,
this is really clever that it nailed it.
Really Great.

559
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:15.010
He's a giant fat guy like me.
Yeah,
that's what he said.
Giant.
Great,

560
00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:18.960
great big giant fat guy like me.
Yeah.

561
00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:23.970
Um,
so anyways,
that's,
that's amazing.
That was the best thing.

562
00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:29.190
So special.
Thank you.
What a,
what a treat.
What a neat,

563
00:37:29.191 --> 00:37:33.500
neat trade.
That was.
Incredible.
So anyway,
I want to see how Richard did.
I didn't,

564
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:36.650
I only saw the headline that Joey chestnut one.
I don't know.

565
00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:40.260
Was he at the Nathan's or was this a different one?
I don't,
I'm not sure.

566
00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:41.460
I don't know.
I have to look him up.

567
00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:47.450
There's an IOC website and you can see all the competitive eaters there and it

568
00:37:47.941 --> 00:37:51.750
gives their stats and like what they're good at and stuff.
Hmm.
Well we'll see.

569
00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:56.910
We'll see.
Uh,
Nathan's right.
Nathan's.
Yeah,

570
00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:01.440
I tell you anything.
We'll see if,
uh,
Jesus,
he,

571
00:38:01.441 --> 00:38:04.500
he regains a hot dog eating title and sets a record today.

572
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:11.130
And you already said that he,
he drinks gallons of water to expand the stomach.

573
00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:14.870
That's how they train.
You think they trained by eating?
It's not that it's,

574
00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:17.350
it's they train the stomach muscle because that's what it is.

575
00:38:17.351 --> 00:38:21.510
So they expanded La a few weeks before that.

576
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:26.190
Kobayashi was really good at it cause he was physically fit and he would train

577
00:38:26.191 --> 00:38:30.630
his stomach too.
He was,
he was really good at it.
So it looks like a,
yeah.

578
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:34.380
Um,
but then there was some weird thing with the,
the league in him.

579
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:38.350
Let's ashy man,
what are you looking at?

580
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:42.970
I was looking to see if there's like a list of the results might be too soon.

581
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:46.420
Yeah.
All right.
Anyways,

582
00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.570
yeah,
go ahead.
No,
I'm just,
uh,

583
00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:55.390
I just thought we'd bring up some topics of what happened in our lives this
week.

584
00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:58.930
We had to take Betsy to the Er.
Oh my God.
Finally

585
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:05.500
for her eating something toxic.
Uh,
after Saturday,
Saturday night,

586
00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:09.940
we fed her dinner and she was running around the backyard with a fief and she

587
00:39:09.941 --> 00:39:13.060
ran into a Rose Bush and just like kept on Roland.

588
00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.220
I was going out to dinner with a sickle cell.

589
00:39:15.221 --> 00:39:20.221
I was going to go to the comedy store to do my spot and Uber on the way it was

590
00:39:21.101 --> 00:39:25.720
actually out front.
By the time,
you know,
this happened and her little legs,

591
00:39:25.721 --> 00:39:27.790
her hind legs kind of collapsed on her,
her,

592
00:39:27.791 --> 00:39:32.770
and she was woozy and she wouldn't respond to us and she just looked like sec.

593
00:39:32.771 --> 00:39:36.460
Like this dog was no good.
So we throw in the car,

594
00:39:36.461 --> 00:39:41.320
we cancel our plans for the night,
we go to the Er,
the doggy Er of course.

595
00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:45.100
And what happens as we park,
what happens?

596
00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:52.900
Bounce right back.
Right back.
Bad.
Nothing.
Like nothing was wrong,

597
00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:55.360
nothing was wrong.
So she ate something Shitty I think.

598
00:39:55.361 --> 00:39:57.910
And then it just kind of flushed out of her system.
I don't know.

599
00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:00.700
She wasn't fine ever since,
but they got,

600
00:40:00.701 --> 00:40:04.780
that saved us about a thousand dollars and you know dog er,
you know,

601
00:40:04.781 --> 00:40:08.130
cause they pulled that bullshit on you like oh we should keep it here overnight

602
00:40:08.131 --> 00:40:12.340
and given an ivy and all this nonsense should continue the same behavior.

603
00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:17.290
You have to do it.
Yeah.
We literally halfway through drought I'm like,

604
00:40:17.291 --> 00:40:18.880
I think she's already a little better.
Yeah.

605
00:40:18.881 --> 00:40:22.660
Cause she was licking my hand and for a second it was really scary.

606
00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:27.430
She like was not responding and she was like,
I thought she had a concussion.

607
00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:31.470
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
So I run into a roadblock but have,

608
00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:34.480
then we got to the place and she was sniffing lick and stuff and she was like,

609
00:40:34.481 --> 00:40:39.190
is this a play place?
She came back to life.
Thank goodness.

610
00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:42.460
That was quite a scare.
It was very scary.
I hate,

611
00:40:42.461 --> 00:40:46.020
I hate that when that whole skiff safe,
man,
I don't want feed was sick though.

612
00:40:46.021 --> 00:40:49.030
When we first got him,
it was horrible and that was fucking worse.

613
00:40:49.031 --> 00:40:53.350
The other thing is that with a,
with fee,
if they were like,
it's $1,000 a day,

614
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.390
a day.
I remember the day,

615
00:40:55.480 --> 00:41:00.280
I know we did a fundraiser show and oh my God,
we saved his life is great.

616
00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:05.110
It's the best thing.
But tonight is his least favorite night of all,

617
00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:08.410
all year.
He hates tonight more than any.
Most doggies.

618
00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:12.410
This is scary night for animals.
Don't say a fucking thing.
Yeah,

619
00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:17.290
it's scary.
It's a fireworks.
They hate it.
Cats and dogs loose.

620
00:41:17.291 --> 00:41:20.800
I'm sure I'll animals.
I don't know what's happening is my dog and hope.

621
00:41:20.801 --> 00:41:22.120
Fuck the Shit Outta you.

622
00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:29.260
Don't pet my dog,
asshole,
asshole.

623
00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:33.500
Linkedin is helpful like Lincoln.

624
00:41:33.501 --> 00:41:36.870
Then I don't fucking like,
hey,

625
00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.720
so Lincoln,

626
00:41:38.721 --> 00:41:42.980
did I tell you that I became obsessed with Dan Pena this week?
Well,
yeah.
I mean,

627
00:41:42.981 --> 00:41:45.950
it was kind of a big hit on the show and a big hit in my heart.

628
00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.740
I knew you were going to love it.
I love it.
And I did an episode of,

629
00:41:48.741 --> 00:41:51.710
that's deep bro on him this week.
It's already dropped if you want to hear it.

630
00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:56.510
And I get really into him.
So I researched and I read his website.

631
00:41:56.511 --> 00:42:00.250
I read his Ebook,
I watched all the videos I could.

632
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:03.410
He's basically an old school.
He's my dad's age,

633
00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:08.000
so he's just old school military guy.
Um,

634
00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:11.960
not so much shish wads of eve though.
I'll tell you that.
Like he's,

635
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:15.760
he's got $50 billion,
but he doesn't have fun with it ever.
Like,

636
00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:20.780
because his whole thing is,
he goes,
I work seven days a week,
20 hours a day.

637
00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:25.550
I slept for four hours a night.
And you're like,
why?
Why,
why?

638
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:28.700
Why do you have 50 billion?
You're not even enjoying it.

639
00:42:28.701 --> 00:42:32.580
Your wife probably can't stand it.
It's,
um,

640
00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:35.090
it's a little,
it's a little much.
Well,

641
00:42:35.091 --> 00:42:37.710
what's the difference between 50 million and for hanging out with losers?

642
00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:41.470
Like wasting your time with people that meet,
correct.
Correct.

643
00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.700
Show me your friends and I'll show you the future.

644
00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:48.230
That's one of your top.
It is three pieces.

645
00:42:48.231 --> 00:42:50.600
Show me your friends and I show you your future.

646
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:52.230
You want to know why you're all fucked up.

647
00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:56.460
Just look at the fucking bomb to hang around with.
You know,

648
00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:58.330
he said that to his kids.
Fucking love it.

649
00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:03.770
Now my father literally said those words to me.
You a friend is a goddamn loser.

650
00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:08.750
This guy's a fucking losers.
Was real big on lose on a foreign lexicon.
Losers.

651
00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:12.920
Yeah.
My Dad told me my friends will lose a lot and he's right.
He was right,

652
00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:16.300
but he was fucking right that says,
why your fucking whore?

653
00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:22.780
Um,
so yeah,
you had him on mind.
I just,
I discussed it and uh,

654
00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:27.410
his dad was a policeman.
I think his dad was a hard knock sky on him.
Oh.

655
00:43:27.411 --> 00:43:30.050
And I had,
um,
pat McAfee on charge it to the game.

656
00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:35.160
A lot of people were recommending him before he does stand up and he's a punter

657
00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:37.220
in the NFL and it's all,
my God,

658
00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:42.500
it's really hilarious.
In the conversation we had.
So check it out,

659
00:43:42.501 --> 00:43:46.580
charge it to the game.
Pat McAfee,
the kickoff specialist,

660
00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:51.250
punter holder for the Indianapolis Colts.
Really funny.
Really funny.
Um,

661
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:55.490
so yeah,
so Dan Pena,
there you go.
He's my new hero.

662
00:43:56.530 --> 00:44:00.260
He's crazy.
It's great.
I just,
you know what it is.
I,
I do miss.

663
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:05.510
I miss these people.
I miss this time of our dads like guys that just say shit,

664
00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:10.760
they're gone.
Everybody's so afraid of hurting people's fucking feelings.

665
00:44:10.761 --> 00:44:14.420
And this is just an old school way of being.
And it's not entirely wrong.

666
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:18.480
The guys kind of right about a lot of stuff,
hanging out.
Losers.

667
00:44:18.481 --> 00:44:22.790
You're going to be a loser.
His whole thing too.
It's so funny.
On his website,

668
00:44:22.791 --> 00:44:26.180
he's like,
just fucking do it.
Stop being a fucking cunt.

669
00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.510
It just fucking do it.
And I think moving to the UK,

670
00:44:29.511 --> 00:44:32.010
really up to his usage of the word cunt.
He says it a

671
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:36.500
<v 3>lot.
Yeah.
That is a,
I know.
But when you hear an American say it like as he does,</v>

672
00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:40.200
heck yeah.
It sounds,
you're like she Christ.
Yeah.
He's like,
you fucking cunt.

673
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:43.710
You're a fucking cunt really tossing around.
It's great.
I love it.
I love it.

674
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:46.800
<v 5>I listened to him.
I know he has a podcast is not very good.</v>

675
00:44:46.801 --> 00:44:50.750
He's not a good pod caster.
Yeah,
but it's ask,
they ask him anything.

676
00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:54.580
He reads like a question and answered it in three seconds,

677
00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:57.240
then moves onto the next one.
He's like,
how do I get this time?

678
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:59.590
You fucking go do it.
And the next question is like,
yeah,

679
00:44:59.810 --> 00:45:02.250
that's how he does his find guys.
And he's like,
yeah,
Dan,

680
00:45:02.251 --> 00:45:04.100
how do I become successful?
Like okay,

681
00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:09.020
<v 7>that's all my fucking website.
It's all there.
It's all fucking free wipes.</v>

682
00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:13.530
That's every answer is go to my fucking website.
We're in fucking say,

683
00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:18.990
<v 5>it's so great.
And 11,
I don't know where he gets the $50 billion man from.</v>

684
00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.620
I don't know what happened.
Know what it is,
is that he was catchy.

685
00:45:21.621 --> 00:45:26.330
It's a good marketing,
but he was a CEO of some company and then he got fired,

686
00:45:26.331 --> 00:45:29.990
but he made the company a lot of money and then he became a coach immediately.

687
00:45:29.991 --> 00:45:31.760
Like he's like,
I got fired.

688
00:45:31.761 --> 00:45:36.470
And then the next day I started coaching people and then he started the Scotland

689
00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.090
Castle thing.

690
00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:43.130
But you know how he makes his money is he charges you $20,000 a pop to go to his

691
00:45:43.131 --> 00:45:46.970
seminar Scotland.
Right.
And he says to you,
focus on the few,

692
00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.280
not the many meaning like you,

693
00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:53.520
you get $20,000 from 10 people versus $1.
We are,

694
00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:57.180
you see the little room he's in,
it's probably 10,
15 people Max,
right?
Yeah.

695
00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:01.880
And suits.
They're all sitting there like it.
Of course.
I'm sure he's like,

696
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:05.840
don't dress like a fucking shithead in my class.
Yeah.
He works out twice a day.

697
00:46:05.841 --> 00:46:09.320
Dan Pena,
that's part of his 20 hour day and he's 70 years old.

698
00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:13.170
He sleeps four hours.
He is the wife who's also a high achiever.

699
00:46:13.171 --> 00:46:17.330
So she understands the signs to intense.
Yeah,

700
00:46:17.331 --> 00:46:21.220
he's super intense by the way.
Super Fun.
Somebody wrote in right

701
00:46:21.310 --> 00:46:23.120
<v 3>to us.
Um,</v>

702
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:27.950
on reddit there's a subreddit for the show.
So a lot of people,

703
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:32.600
I might not know that,
but a lot of activity and it's a,
it's a,
it's a good place.

704
00:46:32.601 --> 00:46:36.140
A lot of funny things are posted there.
Somebody on reddit asked,
hey,

705
00:46:36.141 --> 00:46:39.740
mommy's sorry for being dense and maybe this whole thing going is going right

706
00:46:39.741 --> 00:46:44.350
over my head,
but I can't figure out if the whole,
Ooh Baby Jesus,

707
00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:48.400
Ooh,
he's having a rough night.
Yeah.

708
00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.890
We had to reschedule our recording today,
but people don't know that.
Yeah,

709
00:46:51.891 --> 00:46:54.170
this is,
we usually record her in the day.
Yeah.

710
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:59.120
This is a night to been orange or sitter for the,
for when we do the show.

711
00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:04.670
Uh,
sick.
I want to stop.
Should we stop,
pause and see how he goes.
Hold on.

712
00:47:04.671 --> 00:47:09.550
Start this over again.
Okay.
We're back.
We're back.
Uh,
is he,
is he?
Yeah,
he's,

713
00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:14.040
I think he's okay.
You put your dad glasses on and tell your dad powers.

714
00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.400
Powers through the walls.
Um,

715
00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:20.160
so I should get back to this email please.
Yeah,

716
00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.750
so he says I can't figure it out.
The whole salad.

717
00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:25.470
My thing is real or real or a joke.
Totally real.
If so,

718
00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:28.610
or time on Christina [inaudible] or somebody playing a joke on them.
God.

719
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:32.080
It seems hard to believe and I feel like an idiot for not being able to tell

720
00:47:32.081 --> 00:47:37.060
what it is.
Thanks.
High and tight.
Dude.
I appreciate you posting this,
but this is,

721
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:41.320
here's what,
it's all real.
You joined the show later,
but here's what happened.

722
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:44.780
Christina got a new phone number,
months and months,
I don't know how long ago,

723
00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:45.733
a year ago now.

724
00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:50.950
And there was a series of text messages and phone calls from different for

725
00:47:50.951 --> 00:47:53.440
different people.
Yeah.
One was for a dude,
eight is who

726
00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:56.803
we should tell you what.

727
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.820
Shenaz is a nurse and she's allowed nursing opportunities.

728
00:47:59.821 --> 00:48:04.430
She's not hearing about Aiden gets calls every other week.
Hey,

729
00:48:04.431 --> 00:48:09.110
this has a serious substance abuse problems and a mental illness.
Yeah.

730
00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:11.330
And people are always trying to help them and be like,
are you okay?

731
00:48:11.331 --> 00:48:13.690
Are you got to Rehab?
And then like,
Hey,
I got pills,

732
00:48:13.691 --> 00:48:15.810
I got sticks on deck and all that.
Yes.

733
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.000
And then Salamay is Persian lady and has a friend who never sees her in real

734
00:48:22.481 --> 00:48:26.370
life but leaves her relentless voice mails.

735
00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:31.090
And it's definitely not,
I mean that would cause it to elaborate on the journey.

736
00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:35.890
<v 5>Even show you and I will just,
I've saved the voicemails.</v>

737
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:40.390
Hold on.
I saved the Persian lady.
These are,
this is my real phone.

738
00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:45.390
This is not a joke.
Um,
well why don't I,
here,
I'll show you

739
00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:49.410
<v 3>guys this.
This is not a joke.
Oh,
should I need that one?
Yeah,
you might want to,</v>

740
00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:55.820
uh,
here I keep them for the show blue band.
If you want to.

741
00:48:56.570 --> 00:48:59.900
This says Persian lady.
This is,
this is just hide the top number.

742
00:48:59.901 --> 00:49:02.900
That eight one eight number.
If you could discreetly kind of push it up.

743
00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:09.060
<v 5>Camera.
These I,
I've actually had to create an ad,</v>

744
00:49:09.061 --> 00:49:13.560
like a contact number for Persian lady because I get these calls so frequently.

745
00:49:13.561 --> 00:49:18.200
So we're also so that we never answer,
right.
Accident the accident.
Yeah.
So this,

746
00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:22.470
I guess this number like three people have had and they don't let other people

747
00:49:22.471 --> 00:49:25.020
know that they've changed number and then this is 100% real.

748
00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:29.020
<v 3>I mean you can tell by the translations that we get to that this is like,</v>

749
00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:32.320
this is an old lady calling another old lady about some nonsense,

750
00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:35.920
but she never stopped.
She never gets,

751
00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:38.460
I mean the weird thing is maybe she does see this lady regularly,

752
00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:42.070
never goes like,
hey,
did you get my phone?
I think so.
Or The lady goes,
yeah,

753
00:49:42.071 --> 00:49:45.640
I got your message and is just,
you know,
when old people just go like,

754
00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:50.290
like I told you,
I saw that guy at the place the week after I,
you know,

755
00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:54.880
I saw a guy had uh,
getting my haircut,
old guy and I go outside your last time.

756
00:49:54.881 --> 00:49:58.660
And he goes,
yeah,
we had a nice talk.
And I know we didn't.
Oh right.

757
00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:02.620
But he just said that and I didn't correct him.
Yeah.
Maybe it's that where she,

758
00:50:02.621 --> 00:50:04.890
you know,
oh,
it's this,
it's this.
That's fine.

759
00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:09.980
<v 5>I think what it is with Salamay is that she has this person's the,</v>

760
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:12.980
she has salamis old number,
which is my number one,
and maybe it's a long ways,

761
00:50:12.981 --> 00:50:15.440
new number.
So she,
I think she goes back and forth.

762
00:50:15.441 --> 00:50:19.550
You now I contact save and you don't necessarily see a number.
So I think she,

763
00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:21.880
she had sell them.
They are talking right.

764
00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:25.640
Obviously cause the update about the squirrel and the bags and the law firm and

765
00:50:25.641 --> 00:50:26.390
the thing.

766
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:30.320
But she's messages at the old number and she's not aware that she's doing that.

767
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:31.960
Yeah.
Cause I've done that.
Haven't,

768
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.570
you know like we were like your dad's old number and then you don't even look at

769
00:50:35.571 --> 00:50:39.530
it.
Yeah.
It's just the content.
Sometimes I have friends who

770
00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:45.300
<v 3>have changed number so many times and at 1.01 of my friends contacts and add</v>

771
00:50:45.641 --> 00:50:49.650
four numbers and I had to finally at like,
which of these should I delete?
Right,

772
00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:51.700
right.
I've had them for too,
too long.

773
00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:58.180
<v 8>Hello?
Hello mate.
Thanks a lot.
She goes [inaudible] time.</v>

774
00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:01.260
Would you find in the grocery man bought it immediately or not?
You know?

775
00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:04.790
Oh my God.
Oh mighty God.

776
00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:08.380
[inaudible] they're up there.

777
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:10.020
I hadn't dealt with.

778
00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:13.770
<v 5>It's just,
it's crazy man.
It's outrageous.

779
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:15.063

780
00:51:16.210 --> 00:51:17.043

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:30.190

00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:55.370
For one month.
I mean,

from Sherry.
Very up to now in the ball.

789
00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:58.210
[inaudible] mother,

790
00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:03.340
father [inaudible] she was,

791
00:52:03.341 --> 00:52:04.030
she was saying,
Huh?

792
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:07.390
<v 5>Somebody wrote in that this was,
it's super crass.</v>

793
00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:11.800
The way she's speaking in Farsi too.
Yeah.
Then she's saying like Condon a whore.

794
00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:17.640
She's an old lady.
You can tell.
Yeah.
All school lady.
Yeah.
Wow.
Mary,
you go.

795
00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:21.800
Solomon is a,
it's very real,
my man.
It's not,
it's not a prank.

796
00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:25.930
We want the calls to stop.
Seriously.
Just don't,

797
00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:31.570
it's a good,
I would say that everything on your mom's house is,

798
00:52:31.571 --> 00:52:35.980
our lives are,
we don't make up stuff on the show now.
We even,

799
00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:38.200
some of you share too much.
I'd made it.
Yeah.

800
00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:41.820
<v 3>A thing that,
um,</v>

801
00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:46.020
we don't want fake,
you know,
we always go like,
oh,
is it fake?

802
00:52:46.021 --> 00:52:48.480
And we get bumped up.
And you don't like the,
you know,

803
00:52:48.481 --> 00:52:51.800
we like to play jokes but we don't like to play like,

804
00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:54.580
<v 5>like fake video.
Yes.
Sometimes they're not real.</v>

805
00:52:54.581 --> 00:52:58.630
Like this guy's reacting to his sister.
Farty and it's not a real,

806
00:52:58.631 --> 00:53:03.310
we don't play it.
Sounds good.
Yeah,
it's definitely not as good.
Anyways.
Um,

807
00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:08.050
also update.
There is a cookie thief in the house.

808
00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:13.720
Do you know anything about this?
I don't.
You want to,

809
00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:17.080
it's so weird because I had burnt so fat.

810
00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:22.450
Yeah.
Well your,
your uncle Dave,

811
00:53:22.570 --> 00:53:27.540
we saw your family yesterday and he handed two special cookies that he brought

812
00:53:27.541 --> 00:53:31.490
from Ohio and they were wrapped special wedding cookies,
right?
Yeah.

813
00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:34.860
And I had them in my purse and I remember thinking,

814
00:53:34.861 --> 00:53:36.690
I can't wait to eat these cookies tomorrow.

815
00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:40.500
And then this morning I looked and there was a,

816
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:45.540
just a rapper with no cookie inside just sitting on the credenza and the living

817
00:53:45.541 --> 00:53:49.890
room.
Do you know what happened?

818
00:53:49.891 --> 00:53:54.420
And there's only one cookie left in my purse.
I might have done it.

819
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:59.730
You think he snuck in last night?
Also our,
you know,

820
00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:03.750
or babysitter or nanny help.
They have a key.
She has a key.

821
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:08.460
So you think the nanny snuck in last night around 9:00 PM ate that cookie and

822
00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:11.670
wrapper on the credential.
But anytime overnight.
Cause when we were,

823
00:54:11.671 --> 00:54:16.350
while we were,
should we add this?
You didn't show up today.
Right.

824
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:18.920
That sounds like a real guilty thing to do.

825
00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:24.050
I just can't believe that somebody had the audacity to rummage through my purse

826
00:54:24.751 --> 00:54:27.540
because we never,
I never discussed the cookies that anybody y'all go,

827
00:54:27.541 --> 00:54:32.040
Dave gave them to me and the audacity of somebody in this house to image through

828
00:54:32.041 --> 00:54:36.540
my belongings,
eat the cookie and then not even bother to hide the evidence.

829
00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:39.540
Wow.
And you fire her.
I'll support you.

830
00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:44.190
I'll stand there and I will definitely have your back
and be like,

831
00:54:44.191 --> 00:54:48.760
you're fucking fired.
I just,
I can't,
I saw,

832
00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:51.600
I'm sorry I can't get over the fact that somebody just left the rat.

833
00:54:51.601 --> 00:54:54.580
I'm disappointed too.
I'm really disappointed.
Yeah.
Yeah.

834
00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:59.350
Well I'm glad we got that out of the way and uh Huh.
Yeah,

835
00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:02.940
it's weird that she could be my mom.
Wait,
that's not it.

836
00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:06.060
It's weird that you would,
uh,
she would,
she would

837
00:55:07.590 --> 00:55:11.660
just leave the wrapper.
Oh,

838
00:55:12.350 --> 00:55:16.560
there's going to be a interesting frame jump.
We'll jump cut.

839
00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:17.590
Interesting.

840
00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:22.640
Blue Angels had a very groundbreaking,
why don't you,

841
00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:27.270
why don't you tell everybody we spoke over the phone a couple of days ago and

842
00:55:27.271 --> 00:55:30.870
while we were talking,
all of a sudden I just heard the touch tone sound.

843
00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:35.430
Thank you.
Smash the phone with your face that I have to say this.

844
00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:40.620
I don't fucking think so.
You're becoming top dog.

845
00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:44.490
I hate to tell you this,
but you are,

846
00:55:44.491 --> 00:55:47.730
and you becoming him so much that the other day you walked in the room and you

847
00:55:47.731 --> 00:55:51.920
didn't do this.
Like ironically you,
you meant that you were like,

848
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:55.030
you go,
I had a couple,

849
00:55:55.031 --> 00:55:59.340
a really good farts today and you did not do it as a joke.

850
00:55:59.650 --> 00:56:04.500
You were earnest.
No Bull Shit.
I had a couple of good farts today.

851
00:56:04.501 --> 00:56:08.220
I said that and then,
um,
yeah,
no,

852
00:56:08.221 --> 00:56:11.070
but the joke that I did to you earlier today,

853
00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:14.280
I said you want to hear a cool fart?

854
00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:20.700
That's such a good one.
Stick.
This soldier was.
Yes.

855
00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:23.620
People that like live

856
00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:26.350
<v 3>have fun and if you're a listener,</v>

857
00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:30.930
I think that'd be a really fun thing to try to incorporate into your life.

858
00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:34.150
Marriage and your marriage would also like to your parents,
to your friends,

859
00:56:34.151 --> 00:56:34.901
to your siblings.

860
00:56:34.901 --> 00:56:38.770
Say you want to hear a cool fart right before you have to want to hear a cool

861
00:56:38.771 --> 00:56:42.490
fart and then probably be like,
yeah,

862
00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:47.290
then you do it.
Nobody says yes,
but you didn't say yes,
of course not.

863
00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:50.020
Why don't you want to hear a cool fart?
I hear them all the time with you.

864
00:56:50.021 --> 00:56:52.470
I spent,
this one was really cool and I was holding it on to,

865
00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:55.420
you know what's so crazy?
If you guys are listening and you have a spouse,

866
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:58.960
have you ever had a fart that smells like your spouses?

867
00:56:59.270 --> 00:57:04.240
Like I farted in bed and it smelled like one of your farts.
Isn't that special?

868
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:06.820
That's pretty neat.
I didn't think that that was the case.

869
00:57:06.850 --> 00:57:09.520
I thought it smelled just like your stinky ass hole,
but

870
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:16.300
energy is now.
You call it synergy.
I should have.
Yeah,
that is synergy.

871
00:57:16.330 --> 00:57:21.330
But I tried to put a posted on monster Graham last week that I was at the

872
00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:27.600
butthole doctor checking fries.
People that listeners,
yeah,
update.

873
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:29.920
And so everybody was asking me like,
what happened?
What happened?

874
00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:32.430
What happened was nothing.
We just did a,

875
00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:37.720
it was just like a get to know your butthole.
He,
uh,
he just wants to run tests.

876
00:57:38.830 --> 00:57:40.740
Did he check your oil?
No,
but it's going to come up.

877
00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:44.410
He said he's going to check your oil now for a while though.
He's busy.

878
00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:45.670
Buy Holes are busy,

879
00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:50.860
but we're going to wait for you to suffer the way I have the last year and a

880
00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:55.120
half.
He now that,
you know,
narrow sense.
It's funny.
It's just how it always is.

881
00:57:55.121 --> 00:57:59.650
You know,
if you're,
will you fucking stop.
He's like,
you know,

882
00:57:59.651 --> 00:58:02.060
if you're like my shoulder hurts and then you go to the doctor,
you're shore.

883
00:58:02.070 --> 00:58:04.450
It doesn't hurt.
Ever since I've gone to him,

884
00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:07.470
I feel much healthier in the Gi track.
Yeah,

885
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:11.250
seriously.
You know what it may have been.
What?

886
00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:14.260
I've cut out those heavy breakfasts we were having,

887
00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:18.610
we've been having like smoothies.
I did.
I also called a food allergist,

888
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.250
so I'm finally going to get tested for food allergies.

889
00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:25.490
I bet there's some stuff going on.
Yeah,
I think there's some stuff closely.

890
00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:29.890
I'm not going to end up all Bert.
I'm going to check it out.
No.

891
00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:32.420
Oh Bert,
I like that.

892
00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:37.440
Also want to tell people that a new Patriot episode went up episode three on

893
00:58:38.141 --> 00:58:42.040
Patrion and there's all kinds of goodies in there.

894
00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:47.280
Somebody mentioned even in an email like what's up with FIFA Nader,

895
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:51.310
we haven't heard him speak in a while.

896
00:58:51.790 --> 00:58:55.390
The Fif is on the latest Oh,

897
00:58:55.391 --> 00:59:00.070
episode two has fif and he's going to be back on your mom's house.

898
00:59:00.071 --> 00:59:02.710
We talked to him.
He said he wants to come on and next week,

899
00:59:03.010 --> 00:59:07.710
so you can definitely get to know fif again next week because it has been

900
00:59:07.730 --> 00:59:12.100
awhile.
But he did make an appearance on,
on Patrion episode too.
So did Betsy.

901
00:59:12.790 --> 00:59:16.060
Betsy talked in episode two.
They'll both come on the show.
Don't worry.

902
00:59:16.061 --> 00:59:18.040
It's not that we're keeping them over there.

903
00:59:18.041 --> 00:59:21.620
They just happened to come on when we were doing the Patriot were also

904
00:59:21.621 --> 00:59:25.880
negotiating rates with fif on the double pipe.
Classic shirts.

905
00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:30.450
We're in negotiations with him now,
which is why he's not on today's episode.
And,

906
00:59:31.410 --> 00:59:35.420
and many thanks to everybody that ordered a double pipe classic.

907
00:59:35.421 --> 00:59:38.390
They're very rare.
Double Pipe classic shirts.

908
00:59:38.391 --> 00:59:42.560
We actually had to reorder because so many of you already.
Yeah,

909
00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:47.810
it's a good shirt.
It's really a nice shirt.
I wear mine in Pve,

910
00:59:47.811 --> 00:59:51.260
like water based ink,
I think they call it.
It's soft.

911
00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:54.950
It's a good looking shirt and a,
it's a good way to celebrate.
Um,

912
00:59:55.070 --> 00:59:59.510
having a double pipe or even yearning to have one.
People have told me,

913
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:03.770
can I wear one if I've,
I feel like a fraud.
And it's like,
well,
can you dream?

914
01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:07.220
Of course you can.

915
01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:11.700
That's the first time I've seen you drink water this week.
How Fun.

916
01:00:11.701 --> 01:00:15.050
I haven't been paying attention cause I probably had like 70 gallons this week.

917
01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:16.880
Oh,
please.
You know,

918
01:00:16.881 --> 01:00:19.550
I've been getting a lot of Twitter support from my end in this.

919
01:00:19.551 --> 01:00:23.900
People realizing you're showboating and you're bullshitting.

920
01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:26.930
And the truth is I hydrate constantly.

921
01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:29.660
You just hydrate for the cameras and people are catching on.

922
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:32.600
People are catching on

923
01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:42.740
amazed to flow and your age to know when I have an age to showboating because

924
01:00:42.741 --> 01:00:47.630
I'm the one who actually drink the coffee.
My Dad came over,
uh,
yesterday.

925
01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:51.980
Was that fun.
Yeah.
And brought a friend,

926
01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:58.430
Jeff,
all of them.
So some an interesting things.
Shared some knowledge.

927
01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:01.400
This time was neat.
We talked about talking about parenting.

928
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:05.330
He's very bothered by it.
He said it was,

929
01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:08.450
I think at the pool somewhere to pull in.
He goes,
uh,
you know,

930
01:01:08.451 --> 01:01:11.870
these kids were in the pool every two seconds.
People were like,
good job.

931
01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:16.280
Good job.
Yeah,
for the fucking swimming.
Good job.
You say it too much.

932
01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.790
You know,
they should wait til the end of the day and then one time you go,

933
01:01:19.791 --> 01:01:23.180
you did a good job today,
right?
I was like,
Dad,
so you don't,

934
01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:26.660
you don't want to build up a kid's confidence too much.
Right?
And he's like,
no,

935
01:01:26.661 --> 01:01:30.560
of course not.
How'd they got to know?
They do a good job.
I'm like,
that's good.

936
01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:35.030
Thank you.
Do you think we're overdoing it?
He thinks rob,
we're doing it.
Not Us.

937
01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:39.290
Just society.
Society with making kids feel good about themselves.

938
01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.080
He might have a point about how some,

939
01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:46.490
some occasions that can be overdone.
I think saying good job to a kid,

940
01:01:46.491 --> 01:01:49.610
learning how to swim.
I think that's okay.
I think you probably do that.

941
01:01:49.830 --> 01:01:53.510
You should.
Yeah.
Good job.
I agree.
Especially if they're really young.

942
01:01:55.150 --> 01:01:59.970
So that was nice.
Two,
three years old.
No,
just once.
Once a day to day.
Yeah.

943
01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:03.170
I don't think my dad really,
uh,
gave me a lot of praise.

944
01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:08.540
Clearly somebody pointed out.
Speaking of water,

945
01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:12.830
the,
I wrote an email to your water champ and other mommy.
Christina.
Okay.

946
01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.260
I think I figured out why Tina thinks she's the water champ.

947
01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:19.010
Really as you can here.
At what hour?
Eight minutes.

948
01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:22.290
10 seconds of episode three 42 we're in.

949
01:02:22.291 --> 01:02:25.140
Tina thinks Tom's dental story is her own.

950
01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:29.730
Obviously this means never.
Tom Takes a drink of hydrating and refreshing.

951
01:02:29.731 --> 01:02:33.690
Hto a Chabot.
Tina believes she took a drink of water as well.

952
01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:37.260
I think this is where the confusion comes from.
And I think you're correct,
sir.

953
01:02:37.261 --> 01:02:38.610
Thank you for writing into us.

954
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.210
Are you choosing the emails that are being read this week?
These are,
uh,

955
01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:45.870
on the cheese thing.
Yeah.
That's a good theory that came in.
Interesting.
Thanks.

956
01:02:45.871 --> 01:02:48.270
Blue Band.
Good job.
Got Someone got a raise.

957
01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:52.210
<v 9>Yup.
Interesting is correct.</v>

958
01:02:57.010 --> 01:02:59.770
That's interesting point.
Very,
very interesting.

959
01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:04.190
<v 3>I'm here,
I'm going to show you this.
Okay.
Uh,</v>

960
01:03:04.191 --> 01:03:08.690
this is Mr Hydrea put that down.
Sean Lynch.

961
01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:13.220
I've heard his name before.
You've talked about him.
Yes.
This is a great clip.

962
01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:18.800
Uh,
he's talking about,
you know,
playing foosball.
Do you call it?
Yeah.

963
01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:23.150
And I'll just let him be load.
Yeah,
that's his nickname.

964
01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:27.230
His bottom teeth.
A scissor weird.
What's going on there?
There's some gold.

965
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:29.690
I like baby teeth,
but then there's two naturals in the front.

966
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:31.460
Those are all right.

967
01:03:32.370 --> 01:03:34.530
<v 10>If you just run through somebody's face,</v>

968
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:39.250
a lot of people ain't gonna be able to take that over and over and over and over

969
01:03:39.251 --> 01:03:44.251
and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over

970
01:03:46.471 --> 01:03:48.210
and over and over again.

971
01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:52.820
They just knocked on mount that because the deeper metaphor there running

972
01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:54.030
through a motherfucker face.

973
01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:59.690
<v 3>Yeah.
Love it up.
I love it.
Yeah.
Over,
over,</v>

974
01:03:59.730 --> 01:04:03.660
over it.
He's right now shine or play around.
Oh,
I like it.

975
01:04:03.661 --> 01:04:07.620
What does he play again?
What team?
Well,
he just retired.
He played for Seattle.

976
01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:11.280
Nice.
I like him.
Yeah.
What,
how else,
what else do we know him?

977
01:04:11.281 --> 01:04:13.800
Why do I know his name?
Why do you know Marshawn lynch?

978
01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:18.000
What else did we played of his,
that he's,
is he funny?
Yeah,
I mean he's,
he's uh,

979
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:22.710
he's definitely one of the bigger personalities of the last decade in the NFL.

980
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:25.890
He did this thing for,
um,
he hated the media,

981
01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:29.370
basically hated being ordered to speak to them.
It's in your contract.

982
01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:30.283
I agree with him.

983
01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:35.850
He did this press conference where you have,
you're obligated to spend,

984
01:04:35.851 --> 01:04:37.650
let's say in the super bowl,

985
01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:42.480
the press conferences leading up to it 15 minutes so you can to the media.

986
01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:47.160
It's just a contractually,
right.
So whatever he was asked,
he would go,

987
01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:50.160
I'm here.
So they don't find me.
And then they really,

988
01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:54.540
what are you worried at all about what?
Denver.
My,
I'm here so they don't find me.

989
01:04:54.610 --> 01:04:57.890
That's what's up.
And then there's a good,
how are you feeling since getting here?

990
01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.270
He's like,
I'm here to stay.
They don't find me.
Yup.
And it's all he said.

991
01:05:00.271 --> 01:05:01.104
Good for him.
Yeah.

992
01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:05.040
I think it's horrible that they ask you how you feel after you've lost a game.

993
01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:07.770
Was this before the game or even before?
He doesn't want to talk to the media.

994
01:05:07.771 --> 01:05:10.510
He wants to get in his own head.
Get into zone.
Yeah,
I'll him,

995
01:05:10.570 --> 01:05:14.580
they find him for that.
I don't know if they find him for that Saturday,

996
01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:18.170
I think I remember doing,
I remember it well.
He did this thing during the,

997
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:22.990
before that where he was getting fined for.
Never speaking.
Like,

998
01:05:22.991 --> 01:05:25.840
at first it was like,
I'm not,
so they were just asking him,

999
01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:30.550
he wouldn't respond and then he came up with some,
some answer.

1000
01:05:30.551 --> 01:05:34.210
There was also like a really dismissive answer.
I like him all.

1001
01:05:34.211 --> 01:05:36.850
I forget what it was,
and then it became,
I'm here so they don't find me.

1002
01:05:36.851 --> 01:05:39.580
So it was like,
it was a progression to that.
Good for him.
Yeah.

1003
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:44.380
He's my new favorite hymn and Allen Iverson timeout practice over over again.

1004
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:45.820
They're just not all along with that.

1005
01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:51.430
I think there's a deeper metaphor there were onto a Ma Fucka face.
Yup.
Yeah.

1006
01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:55.720
Okay.
That's true.
I like him.
Yeah.
It's a,

1007
01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:59.940
it's a really good way of looking at things actually.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
you could,

1008
01:05:59.950 --> 01:06:04.390
I think Dan Pena would like that,
but you think I,
yeah,
of course.
Yeah,

1009
01:06:04.391 --> 01:06:06.580
of course.
Of course.
Then you would be like,

1010
01:06:06.581 --> 01:06:09.240
you should run through a motherfucker face.
Get that cotton.

1011
01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:13.560
Fucking fuck him in the face.
They can bugger off fucker.
Yeah.
Um,

1012
01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:15.590
<v 10>he swabbed his 60 minute break,</v>

1013
01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:20.640
one dinner right at Taco Bell.

1014
01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:23.310
And I couldn't even get no mother case.
A dealer

1015
01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:30.580
<v 3>case dealer.
Marshawn's got personality.
Yeah,
I liked that guy.
Yeah.</v>

1016
01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:34.190
<v 5>You know,
if he's not really feeling it,
he just can't do it.</v>

1017
01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:35.990
Why can't I walk with my phone?

1018
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:39.680
We had never done a walking shot like this before.
Um,
you know,

1019
01:06:39.681 --> 01:06:43.250
he agreed to do it,
but he was kind of on his phone.
I don't even think he was,

1020
01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:48.110
he was facetiming somebody.
I asked him,
can we just,
can we take that again?

1021
01:06:48.111 --> 01:06:52.300
But maybe you're not talking on the phone this time,
but he,
he,
he wasn't

1022
01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:54.930
<v 10>all know you as the worst.</v>

1023
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:57.910
The worst in my Damn Mama.

1024
01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:02.810
<v 5>Huh?</v>

1025
01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:07.210
<v 10>That's great.
I love,
love that guy.
Might see some needles on the ground term.</v>

1026
01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:09.680
I see some Thai rigs,
you know what I'm saying though?

1027
01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:14.450
The sharp had to stay on your toes.
How's that impact?
You've seen that as a kid?

1028
01:07:14.451 --> 01:07:17.660
I think it impact me to be prepared to deal with y'all.

1029
01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:22.040
If you come to me with something,
I'm probably going to see that a mile away.

1030
01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:25.200
<v 3>Love it.
My new favorite,
but see,</v>

1031
01:07:25.310 --> 01:07:30.030
it seems like you like what a lot of people like,
which is authentic people.
He's,

1032
01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:33.070
he keeps it 104,
like four.
I like it too.
All Shit.

1033
01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:38.040
That's why I was drawn to Dan Pena to
live your life that way.
Well,

1034
01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:40.840
I was just 20 years and years Miley.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
No,

1035
01:07:40.841 --> 01:07:44.650
I spent all week with Dan Pena when I've met people like that.
I'm the same way.

1036
01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:48.280
Yeah,
it's not,
I mean,
the cursing I do like,
I'd like people to love it,

1037
01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:50.400
but it's just,
it's the,
um,

1038
01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:55.420
it's people that aren't trying to make you,
trying to please you.

1039
01:07:55.421 --> 01:07:56.660
They genuinely being this.

1040
01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:59.710
That's why people tell you to be yourself when you really are these guys like

1041
01:07:59.711 --> 01:08:01.300
Marshawn and Pena.
Actually,

1042
01:08:01.301 --> 01:08:06.250
what they have in similarity with each other is that they are both authentic.

1043
01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:10.090
Zero fucks given oh zero fucks given,
but they're being true to themselves.

1044
01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.840
You know who's like that is top dog too.
I'm not exactly,
top dog doesn't get it.

1045
01:08:13.841 --> 01:08:18.200
Doesn't care.
No.
My favorite about top dog and so when a force today buddy,

1046
01:08:18.201 --> 01:08:21.590
that stuff,
but then it's like top dog.
Do you want to go to Italy?

1047
01:08:23.130 --> 01:08:26.810
Asked,
I've dog if he wants to go to France or Italy.
Yeah.

1048
01:08:28.310 --> 01:08:31.800
Why not top dog for what made you go,
wow,

1049
01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:36.440
I'm pretty amazing artifacts.
Museums there.
He's like,
yeah,

1050
01:08:36.450 --> 01:08:40.360
I think about a museum art museum.
You walk in,
you see it,
and then you saw it.

1051
01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:45.230
It was like,
I don't need to see it.
Thank you.
Saw It,
you know.

1052
01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:48.650
But that's why I love that same picture on online.
I can look it online.
Yeah.

1053
01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:52.490
And also what I love is that your dad has zero tolerance for small talk or

1054
01:08:52.491 --> 01:08:56.570
socializing too,
for maybe not even to a fault.
He talked to me,

1055
01:08:56.571 --> 01:08:59.810
he and I jam out.
Yeah.
Cause I'll talk about war with him all day.

1056
01:08:59.811 --> 01:09:04.010
I want to talk about Alan's people making conversation best a little much.

1057
01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:07.730
Yeah.
Walks away from people as they're talking to him.

1058
01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:10.970
I know happened at a wedding.
Somebody goes,

1059
01:09:10.971 --> 01:09:14.960
don't think you're old man like me that much.
And I go,
why is that?
And he goes,

1060
01:09:14.961 --> 01:09:18.260
well you know,
he said something and I asked,

1061
01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:23.140
then he asked me something and I was answering.
He walked away.
No.
Yeah.

1062
01:09:23.150 --> 01:09:25.610
It's just,
that's,
that's because that person was boring topic.

1063
01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:28.210
He was born and he talk about the stuff talking and telling me.

1064
01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:31.790
Well the thing is that you're boring.
You're fucking boring him.
Top Dog and I,

1065
01:09:31.791 --> 01:09:34.810
we took that cruise in Cincinnati on the river that day.
Yeah.

1066
01:09:34.850 --> 01:09:39.320
Your Dad and I sat on the top deck and we wrapped for like 30 kids.

1067
01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:43.400
30 minutes to do though.
I love your dad cause he didn't give a fuck.

1068
01:09:43.401 --> 01:09:46.850
I don't give a fuck and we don't give a fuck together.
Right.
And it's really fun.

1069
01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:48.710
Yeah.
Yeah.

1070
01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:52.280
I tried not giving a fuck with your family yesterday and I was penalized and

1071
01:09:52.281 --> 01:09:56.390
peer pressured.
Yeah.
And to going on a fucking walk that I didn't want to go on.

1072
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:58.910
It's so funny that you said so.
This is the best.

1073
01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:03.200
We're at my cousin units house and her parents are in town.

1074
01:10:03.201 --> 01:10:05.870
My uncle Dave and Blanca,
they've been,
they've been here before.

1075
01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:09.790
They've been on the show before.
Um,
I think it was actually a,
uh,

1076
01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:14.750
a phone call that they did on,
maybe it was on a,
on a bonus episode.

1077
01:10:14.751 --> 01:10:18.980
If you go back to like the,
um,
the,

1078
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:23.940
the,
what's it called?
Itunes bonus episodes.
So why don't you can buy on Amazon.

1079
01:10:23.941 --> 01:10:26.570
And once I called,
yeah,
all right.

1080
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:31.900
<v 8>Told me that last time.
And your mom and she said,
Oh,</v>

1081
01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:33.710
me,
she told me is making that up.

1082
01:10:34.150 --> 01:10:36.940
<v 3>I have,
I have a recording of her saying it</v>

1083
01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:41.880
<v 8>did.
You had a kid in no way told me,
I hate to tell you what's happening now.</v>

1084
01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:44.490
I ain't going to tell you the truth.

1085
01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:50.060
I don't even feel them when they coming out and they said she was just loud.

1086
01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:56.790
They said,
teach you just fun the ice if I might,
because I smelled it.

1087
01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:00.450
I don't know because I just don't,
they just escape.

1088
01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:05.590
<v 3>That's Blanca.
She's adorable.
She's really adorable.
Um,</v>

1089
01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:10.720
Bonnie,
tell exactly what causes that counterpart.
So we were at,
yeah,

1090
01:11:10.721 --> 01:11:15.480
Ned's house bribe rise there.
His wife and their daughter.

1091
01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:19.700
Yeah.
It's a lot of people.
It was probably,
what,
10,
12,
I don't know.
Anyways,

1092
01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:23.980
about our,
no,
10 minutes into it,
they go,
hey,

1093
01:11:23.981 --> 01:11:28.420
we're going to go on a walk in a little bit to this beautiful like a point on

1094
01:11:28.421 --> 01:11:32.260
the beach.
We were down in Orange County and we go,
okay,

1095
01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:37.090
um,
do you want to come?
And I go,
sure.
And I go big.
You want to,

1096
01:11:37.150 --> 01:11:40.960
you want to come and you go,
what?
You want to come on this walk?
Can,
you know,

1097
01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:44.110
I don't want to go on a walk at all.
And then it sounds horrible.

1098
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:46.810
Everybody else is like,
hey,
we're getting ready for this walk.

1099
01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:51.190
And then I heard one of them go,
Hey,
are you coming Christina?
And you go,
no.

1100
01:11:51.670 --> 01:11:55.450
And then they go,
are you okay?
And then you go,
yeah.

1101
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:59.170
And then I'm like,
but the thing is I couldn't tell either.
I go,

1102
01:11:59.171 --> 01:12:01.150
are you all right?
And you go,
why is there where it has to be filed?
Okay.

1103
01:12:01.570 --> 01:12:03.610
That was great.
I was having fun with the kid.

1104
01:12:03.611 --> 01:12:06.010
I was playing with Ellis on the floor.
I was like,
why do I want to pick?

1105
01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:07.390
This is the fucking walk.

1106
01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:11.110
We all leave the place.

1107
01:12:11.890 --> 01:12:15.280
And Christy,
I'm going,
so you're staying behind you.
Yeah.

1108
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:18.470
And then as we walked down the hill,
the first,
you know,

1109
01:12:18.490 --> 01:12:23.050
a hundred yards a,
I hear Janeka,
Oh hey wait,
wait,
wait.

1110
01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:27.040
Christina is coming.
And I go,
okay.
And then you go,

1111
01:12:27.070 --> 01:12:29.430
I didn't know I was going to be the only the one that stayed behind.

1112
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:31.380
So you're the only one that was saying,

1113
01:12:31.410 --> 01:12:34.710
well because your uncle Dave is antisocial like me too.

1114
01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:36.480
And I saw him sitting on the couch and I thought,

1115
01:12:36.481 --> 01:12:39.750
oh well he's going to stay behind and we can,
yeah.
Bullshit a little bit.

1116
01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:45.120
I didn't want to go on a walk because the problem is one man's idea of what a

1117
01:12:45.121 --> 01:12:47.970
wok is is wholly agree.
Totally agree.
Totally.

1118
01:12:47.971 --> 01:12:51.590
So how do I know what I'm getting into?
Yeah,
that was all comfortable.

1119
01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:52.980
I'm wearing,
you know,

1120
01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:58.040
not the right shoes and who goes on a fucking family walk fairly walks or what

1121
01:12:58.261 --> 01:13:01.530
Americans do.
What are you talking about?
A lot of Americans do that.

1122
01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:03.210
I'm an American.
I never walked.

1123
01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:06.230
There was never a walk in my life with the family.
Well,
you weren't raised in,

1124
01:13:06.231 --> 01:13:09.750
in American households,
but it is not that uncommon.
I was able to go on,

1125
01:13:09.751 --> 01:13:13.350
why do I have to go on a fucking Laura do it.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1126
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:17.220
He's not even fucking one of us know family walk.
Yeah.
Where would they walk?

1127
01:13:17.570 --> 01:13:21.200
Just to go around the block together?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let me grand.

1128
01:13:21.201 --> 01:13:24.280
We only kind of did it like after someone had surgery or something.

1129
01:13:24.970 --> 01:13:29.920
You should go walk.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I just thought like,

1130
01:13:29.921 --> 01:13:32.110
why do I have to do everything everyone else is doing?

1131
01:13:32.111 --> 01:13:35.650
And then I felt pressured because then your other cousin was like,
are you okay?

1132
01:13:35.651 --> 01:13:39.670
I'm like,
I'm fine.
I'm great.
And then you end up ruining my time right now.

1133
01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:44.080
More to your point,
there are parts of this walk that were like,

1134
01:13:44.290 --> 01:13:48.040
they were not appropriate for a stroller,
Hor horrible store.
I'm like,
dude,

1135
01:13:48.041 --> 01:13:50.740
why don't you just say that there's a stairs,

1136
01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:53.860
two flights of stairs with this fucking stroller?
And he was like,
oh,

1137
01:13:53.861 --> 01:13:57.070
I'll carry the front.
I'm like,
so yeah,
it does.

1138
01:13:57.340 --> 01:14:00.880
And then up hill and then at blazing in the,
in the sun.

1139
01:14:00.881 --> 01:14:04.870
And the beach and I got an a six month old baby was on the sunscreen on fuel and

1140
01:14:04.871 --> 01:14:09.580
you're like,
yeah it is.
But anyways,
it wasn't a stroller walk.

1141
01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:13.510
No.
I know the six month and he's getting burned and everything.
I'm like,
come on,

1142
01:14:13.511 --> 01:14:18.400
get your life.
So then I took the car ride back with your uncle Dave.

1143
01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:23.110
He wants the car.
I'm like me guy got in my car as fast as I could.
Yeah,
I know.

1144
01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:26.380
Go on a fucking walk.
Horrible.
I don't want to do anything.

1145
01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:31.360
I don't want to do anything.
Yeah,
that's the worst.
Check this out.

1146
01:14:31.361 --> 01:14:32.194
You'll like this.

1147
01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:39.220
<v 11>Oh Jesus.
That's a shit.
If that shit bro</v>

1148
01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:46.390
Tweak or to go back to my teen books,
believe what happened.

1149
01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:49.150
<v 3>So for our listeners,</v>

1150
01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:54.200
oh dude is inside his home on the second floor.

1151
01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:59.750
Boy was camera running and a guy on the outside just crawled up the side of the

1152
01:14:59.801 --> 01:15:03.910
wall and is latched onto the outside of the wall,

1153
01:15:04.150 --> 01:15:07.330
cigarette and valleys that you got that shit.
I need my three,
but I got my,

1154
01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:08.710
Oh shit.
I forgot my three bucks.

1155
01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:10.150
<v 11>Sheriff Rogers there.
This dude,</v>

1156
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:15.430
you'll never see chick and nurse pipe broken and we ran and then went to cvs.

1157
01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:19.180
There was security everywhere.
When I hit this guy and he hit me,
I hit him.

1158
01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:22.180
Then he called the cops and they came.
They let me go.
You got to ship.

1159
01:15:26.070 --> 01:15:30.650
Oh Wow.
Well there's certainly a purely dollars.
He's setting me up here.

1160
01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:34.320
Three hours.
It's wrong house,
Huh?

1161
01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:40.590
<v 3>Oh,
he's,
he's really fucked up looking.
Catch him last year he's got ketchup,</v>

1162
01:15:40.591 --> 01:15:43.940
mustard and he's got like 11 d teas,

1163
01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.650
but their space weird and weird colors.

1164
01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:49.353
<v 11>I know</v>

1165
01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:57.330
Jesus Christ as the crack here,
right?
Oh boy.
Oh no crack.
Oh fuck.

1166
01:15:57.331 --> 01:15:59.190
You guys don't have crack.
Oh fuck you guys.

1167
01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:06.070
Fuck you fucking why people have come back to track.

1168
01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:08.400
<v 3>Okay.
That's a good point.</v>

1169
01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:13.260
Next time it's always best to have cracked for people that want crack.

1170
01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:15.510
I didn't know you could score crack for three bucks.

1171
01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:19.410
I didn't know it was that cheap either.
I thought at least five per rock.
Jesus,

1172
01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:23.560
three bucks.
You got to move a lot of rocks to make some profit.
Money.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1173
01:16:23.561 --> 01:16:27.640
Be Good on that.
You've got those three bucks.
Yeah.
Jesus.

1174
01:16:27.810 --> 01:16:30.580
That's like that wonderful whites.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1175
01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:34.870
Like tells like going about these six,
going to sell for nine.
Look,
boot,

1176
01:16:34.871 --> 01:16:38.780
scoot and buggy.
Okay.
Okay.
Hi.
Moneybags.

1177
01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:40.770
Three bucks a pill.
Wow.

1178
01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:47.380
But I guess all things considered,
it's a pretty cheap habit to have crack.
Yeah.

1179
01:16:47.381 --> 01:16:50.450
Yeah.
That's why people would want,
yeah.
In score.
You know

1180
01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:57.650
how much is cook?
I've never bought.
No,
don't know.
I wonder,
do you know who is?

1181
01:16:57.651 --> 01:17:02.650
Definitely.
It's the,
you know,
it's a higher class.
Yeah.
Raga.

1182
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:07.300
Literally you don't score it for three bucks,
man.

1183
01:17:07.530 --> 01:17:09.150
How much coke can I get for three?

1184
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:14.240
They might take one little grain and go like,
there you go.
Yeah.

1185
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:17.660
If you can find that gap closes the smoking crack,

1186
01:17:17.790 --> 01:17:22.370
trying to smoke that shit stuff.
You ain't kidding.

1187
01:17:23.150 --> 01:17:25.460
How do you have out here smoking that crept into that?

1188
01:17:25.461 --> 01:17:27.050
Like you know that it's bad for you.

1189
01:17:27.051 --> 01:17:29.900
Everybody knows not to smoke crack at this point.
Right?
Yeah.

1190
01:17:29.901 --> 01:17:33.370
Starting it as a really bad thing.
That and heroin when you try heroin,

1191
01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:37.580
going to give it a shot.
I think everybody,

1192
01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:42.170
it's universally accepted that it's a bad idea.
Oh yeah.
It's real bad.

1193
01:17:44.710 --> 01:17:45.543
<v 2>Oh,</v>

1194
01:17:54.810 --> 01:17:58.640
bless
them.

1195
01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:02.860
Shits
them shits.

1196
01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:08.040
Did you brush today?
Yeah,

1197
01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:12.230
<v 3>your teeth are really dirty.
Thanks.
It looked like thieves teeth.
All right.</v>

1198
01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:15.960
I'm Brown and parts,
uh,

1199
01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:20.300
do your mommies cow.
That was really gross.
I have a couple of things to tell you.

1200
01:18:20.301 --> 01:18:23.480
I've been listening every week for just over a year now.
And because of you,

1201
01:18:23.481 --> 01:18:26.420
I went to the dentist for the first time in five years.

1202
01:18:26.421 --> 01:18:30.680
The reason I dropped my last dentist was a dick doing things like refusing to

1203
01:18:30.681 --> 01:18:34.610
use novacane.
Luckily it wasn't too bad.
Just two cavities.

1204
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:40.310
I feel now that I will be at dentist regular.
Well that's great.
Good for you.

1205
01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:44.800
But you don't know who that is.
Friday.
No,
sorry.
Um,

1206
01:18:45.610 --> 01:18:49.470
well this next one has the name in it,
but yeah.
Congratulations.
And um,

1207
01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:52.880
we definitely encourage you to,
to definitely go to the dentist as often.

1208
01:18:52.881 --> 01:18:55.430
I found a guy,
by the way,
when I was at the doctor,

1209
01:18:55.431 --> 01:18:59.840
he works in the dentist's office selling a whitening trays for discounts.

1210
01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:05.490
The A,
the Gel.
Yeah.
You found a guy?
Yeah.

1211
01:19:05.690 --> 01:19:10.400
What?
Here's what happened.
I'm waiting to get my butthole chat.
This is the truth.

1212
01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:13.550
Where do you get my butthole check?
The guy in scrubs walks in,

1213
01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:18.290
goes to the counter,
and he goes,
Hey,
I work at whatever doctor,

1214
01:19:18.710 --> 01:19:23.570
three doors down.
Okay.
Um,
the dentist that's for crack.
Go ahead.
And he goes,

1215
01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:27.440
we are moving to whatever,
a new office.

1216
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:31.730
But we wanted to tell people in the building that if you want to get your teeth

1217
01:19:31.731 --> 01:19:36.230
whitened,
we're giving it for free to other,
you got to go.
No,
no,
no.
He Goes,

1218
01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:42.920
God,
you're the worst God.
You have big teeth and might either.
Perfect.

1219
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:47.420
They're so good.
Then he goes,
I said,
hey,
what did you just say?

1220
01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:50.870
I called him out and he goes,
oh,
I'm just doing this.
He goes,
oh,

1221
01:19:50.871 --> 01:19:54.410
I liked that you asked.
Well,
we sell the Gel as well.
He goes,

1222
01:19:54.411 --> 01:19:57.080
do you have the molds?
I go,
I do.
I have the trades.
He goes,

1223
01:19:57.081 --> 01:20:00.410
if you go to this site,
and he gave me like a pass code.
He said,

1224
01:20:00.411 --> 01:20:02.510
you can order the gels.
Uh,
the,
the,

1225
01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:05.600
the refills stuff for just like wholesale cost.

1226
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:08.110
We have a whole kit,

1227
01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:12.930
<v 5>a fridge full of 90 million we don't take again,
it's on the bottom.</v>

1228
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:16.930
Goddammit.
It's,
I know,
I just fucking saw it yesterday.
You didn't,

1229
01:20:17.490 --> 01:20:21.020
I'm telling you it's on the bottom shelf behind the soy milk.

1230
01:20:21.021 --> 01:20:24.780
Show me in a fucking blog.
Do show me.
Cause by the way,

1231
01:20:25.490 --> 01:20:29.400
no good anymore.
Of course it's good.
No it's not.
We moved with it.

1232
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:32.910
It was out in the fucking,
the gels not going to go bad.

1233
01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:36.780
He told me it does go back to bull shit.
Okay,
well anyways,
go buy some more shit.

1234
01:20:36.781 --> 01:20:40.160
You're not going to use on your teeth
by the way.

1235
01:20:40.161 --> 01:20:42.830
I'm really terrified that I don't have a dentist up here yet.

1236
01:20:43.170 --> 01:20:48.020
Calling Gillies pop off.
I am fucked.
How long ago?
And I think about it every day.

1237
01:20:48.050 --> 01:20:50.600
Why can't you call and give them?
What do I do?
Do I call and go,
hey,

1238
01:20:50.601 --> 01:20:55.310
I'd like to become a patient.
You can I buy that I use for my teeth.
The Jelly,

1239
01:20:55.311 --> 01:20:57.980
the Gel already you bought the trays,
you bought the Gel.

1240
01:20:58.010 --> 01:21:01.610
You never bothered committing to whitening them.
Have white in them before.

1241
01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:05.150
You've done it like three times in the last two years.
Hey,

1242
01:21:05.151 --> 01:21:06.420
Mommy's waiting to listen to me ma'am.

1243
01:21:06.730 --> 01:21:09.750
<v 3>Nothing serious.
Central appointment and close to 20 years.</v>

1244
01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:14.460
I am 28 years old and I've been too nervous even looking to going for fear of

1245
01:21:14.461 --> 01:21:15.294
getting judged.

1246
01:21:15.630 --> 01:21:20.370
After listening to you talk about the importance of keeping TVs high and tight

1247
01:21:20.690 --> 01:21:22.560
like my jeans,
I bit the bullet.

1248
01:21:23.610 --> 01:21:27.000
I am happy to report that I came out of my appointment with only three minor

1249
01:21:27.001 --> 01:21:29.010
cavities.
I did find out,

1250
01:21:31.290 --> 01:21:34.410
I did find out that I'm going to need my wisdom teeth removed.

1251
01:21:34.450 --> 01:21:37.740
That's the worst because my bottom ones grew at a 90 degree angle.

1252
01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:42.340
Will cause future issues.
I brush my teeth at least once a day.
Should go for it.

1253
01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:46.260
Let's try for twice guys laws,
minimum,
barely regularly.
Every day.

1254
01:21:46.290 --> 01:21:48.090
Always use mouthwash.

1255
01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:51.480
Thank you for giving me the courage to go to the dentist and step up my teeth

1256
01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:55.830
game.
I do have one tough question though.
Wiseberg Chrysler.
So fat.

1257
01:21:57.990 --> 01:22:00.960
Excellent question.
We don't know.
Nobody knows.
Um,

1258
01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:05.970
but I'm very proud of you for going to the dentist and you should continue to go

1259
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:08.150
and try to up those.
Uh,

1260
01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:11.200
<v 5>can I finish asking my question?
What?
So what do I do?</v>

1261
01:22:11.201 --> 01:22:13.990
Do I call it some dentist and I go,
I'm a new patient.

1262
01:22:14.830 --> 01:22:18.570
I just want to enroll or something.
Here's what I would do.
Okay.
I would call her,

1263
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.900
I would call her old dentist again and I would say,
Hey,
I moved up here.
Yeah.

1264
01:22:23.050 --> 01:22:26.480
Do you recommend anybody in this?
He didn't know shit.
Okay.

1265
01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:30.910
<v 3>So that was the first one.
The second one would be call our physician.
Yeah.</v>

1266
01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:35.080
Works in that area and say we moved up here.
I used to have a guy down there.

1267
01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:39.040
We're up here now.
Can you recommend a dentist?
And he's gonna say yes,

1268
01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:40.210
Doctor Dick de dup.

1269
01:22:40.430 --> 01:22:45.230
<v 5>Cool.
But do I call the dentist before my veneers pop off accidentally?
Yes.</v>

1270
01:22:45.290 --> 01:22:47.600
Get,
get,
get a yes.

1271
01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:51.800
Like get a record already established her.
Do it tomorrow.
Do it.
Look,

1272
01:22:51.801 --> 01:22:53.270
I'm writing it on my fucking hand.

1273
01:22:57.070 --> 01:23:01.900
<v 3>Okay.
Ah,
Shit.
I gotta get going.
Oh,
you gotta go?</v>

1274
01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:06.100
I gotta go.
What do you got?
You got some shit to do.
Yes.
The way if somebody,

1275
01:23:06.101 --> 01:23:10.240
you know,
we played,
I think of soccer guy and I said something like,
Oh,

1276
01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:14.030

1277
01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:15.453

1278
01:23:16.470 --> 01:23:17.303
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1279
01:23:35.490 --> 01:23:39.330
<v 3>That was not as crazy as,
I'm sorry.
Not even close.</v>

1280

It's good for America.
Yes.

Yeah.
Yeah.
No,

1281
01:23:44.341 --> 01:23:47.460

I mean it was passionate,
but come on.

1282
01:23:48.230 --> 01:23:51.720
It's not like the soccer guys were football.

1283
01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:55.440
Um,

My pictures are small or you're touching just right though.

1309
01:25:52.590 --> 01:25:57.570
Like there's my picture
and we used to drink at lunch.

1310
01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:58.613
It was ragged.

1311
01:25:59.730 --> 01:26:04.050
Nobody in this fucking room or gone through any kind of pain like especially you

My daughter would say my dad,

he treats everybody the same.
Fixing my shit.
You're a con,
