00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.260
We have incredible clips.

66
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.760

Where is,

67
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.350
here we go.
Here's our first one.
Let's do it.
Are you ready gene,

68
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.710
where you get into this?
Let's start.

69
00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:51.040
Make sure that this is ready to go.
Here we go.

70
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.260

Both of you.</v>

71
00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.510
25,
25 residential.
Fuck you both.

72
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.000
<v 1>Oh was right.
I don't bring anyone loving to them.
Well,</v>

73
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.770
we'll go to your mom's house.

74
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.580
<v 0>Big Fan of this lady.
We're going to notice in a second before I forget.
Um,</v>

75
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.070
I went to,
uh,
just remind people that they'll see something unusual,

76
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.210
whether they're watching or listening.
This week we're going to tack on,

77
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.970
we had an opportunity to sit with Kate from below deck,

78
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.280
so I love her so much.
When the episode appears to be about to end,

79
00:05:35.281 --> 00:05:37.470
we're going to smack on a real talk segment.

80
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.180
Real talk for the new listeners is we used to really talk about a lot of reality

81
00:05:42.181 --> 00:05:43.660
shows a lot and uh,

82
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.570
it's one of our first segments and we had the great opportunity to have her here

83
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.190
in studio.
So we talked to her for quite awhile.
It's below deck on Bravo.

84
00:05:53.191 --> 00:05:55.320
We've talked about the show before.
We love it.
Yeah,

85
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.980
well you know we fell in love with Kate from the minute

86
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.010
<v 2>we saw her cause her whole thing is,
she's the chief stewardess.</v>

87
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.030
She was two and she has resting bitch face and she's fucking fantastic and

88
00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:07.670
you're going to love the interview.

89
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:11.150
We learned all about the yachting world and you'll never guess how much it cost

90
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:12.370
to charter a yacht for a week.

91
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.060
I think it's a really fascinating conversation with a really fun,
funny,

92
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:20.200
interesting lady.
She's great.
Um,
there's that.

93
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.350
So this lady not,
this is not Kate,
this is not,

94
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.730
I mean they look mad the same.
So this lady is,

95
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.110
I love this woman too though.
I love her spirit.
Identify with her actions.

96
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.470
So do I.
I mean,

97
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.330
it's really unnerving when you're on a nice walk with your dog or your child and

98
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:41.900
you see someone's speeding.
Damn a man.
She's a little heated,

99
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.270
but you know it happens.

100
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.770
<v 3>Fuck you.
25,</v>

101
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.290
25 residential.

102
00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.570
<v 2>I feel this way every time.
A motherfucker spots on our street,
don't you?</v>

103
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.780
Of course I hated,
I am inches away from being this woman right now.

104
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.120
I've talked to the police department about the speeding.
Yeah.
Good for you.
Yeah.

105
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:10.443
Good for you.

106
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.720
I also can't wait until I'm this age when like menopause is officially over and

107
00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:19.210
I'm no longer a woman and shut shut,

108
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.910
stopped wearing a bra put on just sweatpants all day,
every day.

109
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.170
Ratty ass sneakers,
the where's Waldo shirt and get that butch haircut.
Dude.

110
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:30.850
I'm all about it.
You're ready for it.

111
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.150
And a sporty watch to digital digital locks

112
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.670
there.
I got the sweatshirt on already.

113
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.470
We are only priority is giving your dog a high quality of life.
That's it.

114
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.873
Are you serious?

115
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.720
<v 3>I'm serious.
Goddamn residential neighborhood.</v>

116
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.300
25 up the hill.

117
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.780
25 don't you understand?

118
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.530
Chill out yourself,
asshole.

119
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.850
<v 2>I love her.
Can we hire her?</v>

120
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:09.740
Can we hire her to stand on our street and do that?
Wouldn't you love it?

121
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.700
I would love it.
That's such a good idea.
Give her a megaphone though.

122
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:18.290
So it projects 25 asshole.
Always.

123
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:22.610
They're like,
as people are driving,
you just,

124
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.950
you just hear things.
People are looking around,

125
00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.540
<v 3>hey,
fuck you.
Both of you.</v>

126
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:33.701
<v 2>It's pretty great.</v>

127
00:08:33.701 --> 00:08:38.701
You know there's something about women when you take out the instinct to attract

128
00:08:38.891 --> 00:08:42.190
a man,
when that instinct is either gone through nature,

129
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.070
stopping your mensies or by being a lesbian,

130
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:48.610
like those women are like super women.
I just love them so much.

131
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:53.320
When you don't give a shit,
if guys like your energy,
it changes.
It's so funny,

132
00:08:53.321 --> 00:08:56.040
Dude.
It's,
it's just the best.
My energy did it

133
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:03.060
by the way.
There's another,
uh,
when I stopped caring what you're saying.
Yeah.

134
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.870
No one I stopped caring about male,

135
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:12.630

136
00:09:12.631 --> 00:09:15.150

137
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.630

140
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.730
I didn't upload my workout from Yellowstone,

141
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.220
so have no fear guys.

142
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.500
I can't believe how many people thought it would let them down.

143
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.430
There were none of us are going to win because Joe's too far in the lead.

144
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.300
He's going to win,
but I promise you is that I won't come in last.

145
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.710
Well that's the shame spot.
That's the shame spot.
That's really the only thing.

146
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.830
This sober October,
that's the goal is to just not be last.

147
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:53.270
Can't be less because Joe is going to be number one.
Abi.
Yeah.

148
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:58.380
Bart's gonna on the at the 11th hour.
Like,
like,
yeah.
Joe Or Bert.
Yeah.
Bert.

149
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.310
He's going to be up at like midnight.
No latch.
You have a cutoff time.

150
00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:03.144
When's the cutoff?

151
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:08.310
The cutoff time is 7:00 PM Pacific 10 eastern on October 31st

152
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.440
wow.
Yup.
You think Bart's been sober this whole time?

153
00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.400
Um,
I do.
I do think he's been sober this whole time.

154
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.610
I really wish we could've had the bracelet.
I know I would have been so funny.

155
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.840
And surveys called scram or something

156
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:32.830
or we would get alerts if alcohol interdis system humiliating.

157
00:10:32.941 --> 00:10:35.190
I know.
It'd be so funny we put the word out now.

158
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.000
Maybe in one year's time somebody can donate that to the cause.

159
00:10:39.001 --> 00:10:43.380
Is there anybody listening that has a scram bracelet they could donate to sober

160
00:10:43.381 --> 00:10:45.360
October.
Androids of dot.
That's what I'm saying.

161
00:10:45.361 --> 00:10:47.250
That's why I'm putting a call out now.
We have one year.

162
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:52.140
Someone who's affiliated with it will show up.
All right.
Anyways,

163
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:53.123
here we go.

164
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.330
<v 3>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Figure it out.
Figure it out.</v>

165
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:03.330
I hope you get a Goddamn fucking citation for $1 million.

166
00:11:03.331 --> 00:11:04.320
You both pieces.

167
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:11.610
<v 2>Her dog is really chill for having such a fired up owner.
Well,</v>

168
00:11:11.611 --> 00:11:15.010
she's in control of him.
She's in control dude of life,

169
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:17.543
<v 3>Huh?</v>

170
00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:21.933
<v 4>Yes.</v>

171
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.333
<v 2>Dammit.</v>

172
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:32.453
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

173
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.010
<v 4>Okay.</v>

174
00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.370
<v 2>Yeah.
He had a speeding ticket.
Fuck head.</v>

175
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:44.320
My mom would do that all the time.
It made me laugh a lot.
She,

176
00:11:44.321 --> 00:11:47.830
one time she marked a woman who was fake,
her crying.
She was like,
well,

177
00:11:47.831 --> 00:11:51.070
they're finding a parking spot.
And she was like,
oh,
are you going to cry?

178
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:58.180
Was so crazy like this.
Oh my God,
this chick's way funnier.

179
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.730
But she's at fired up about other stuff though.
Well sure.
It's misdirected.
Ain't,

180
00:12:02.731 --> 00:12:07.030
yeah,
it's always like when you're this angry,
I mean God damn.
Yeah.

181
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:15.330
<v 3>Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.</v>

182
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:20.460
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

183
00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.530
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

184
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:26.700
<v 2>That's a little too far.
This is mental.
Yeah.</v>

185
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:32.100
This might be drunk on a segment.
She definitely needs a better haircut.

186
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:37.200
Needs a new haircut.
And then she went from a really funny,

187
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:41.760
too low.
Scary.
Let them go overboard.

188
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:46.310
It was hilarious.
And then there's bending and then there's breaking and yeah,

189
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:50.340
she's got that Lloyd Christmas haircut.
The short banks.

190
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:53.140
That should never looks good dude.
Like the short version probably will.

191
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:54.540
This never looks good.

192
00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:59.790
She probably watched people speed for like years and these are the first people

193
00:12:59.791 --> 00:13:01.440
that should realize that she can yell at like this.

194
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:03.803
<v 3>Okay,</v>

195
00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:10.990
I'm crossing a street by my God damn dog leashes.

196
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.870
I Shit,

197
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:21.060
<v 2>she's not wearing her bra.
She looks up.
No,
I just saw the her nips waves ones.</v>

198
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:25.620
Yeah,
like mine.
It hurts her hanging low.

199
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.720
She has a better bra.
I would like this.

200
00:13:28.721 --> 00:13:33.721
You don't know where else I would like her on the speaker at the grocery store.

201
00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:39.160
Yeah.
It's really back up.
You know when people start taking their time,

202
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.610
trader Joe's parking lot,

203
00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:46.240
when that motherfucker who's in the parking spot and they're not backing out

204
00:13:46.241 --> 00:13:51.130
immediately.
Yup.
Whoever's checking their email,
sitting in the parking spot,
go,

205
00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:53.170
dude,
I agree.
If two seconds go,

206
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.610
<v 3>fuck
yeah,</v>

207
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.920
<v 2>still talking.
They're driving away and she's still,</v>

208
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:07.030
that's when you know you're really fired up.
Yeah.
Can I ruined her whole day?

209
00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.280
That was really something that was really,

210
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.943
<v 3>Shit.</v>

211
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:20.420
<v 2>Life is so magical,
isn't it?
It is a really fascinating,</v>

212
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:25.040
I can see myself going down that path.
Like,
let's say I'm a widow,

213
00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:29.480
you die and I'm that age and I'm not getting with other dudes.

214
00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.960
Kids are grown.
It's just me and the five dogs,
five dogs,

215
00:14:32.961 --> 00:14:36.530
and maybe we're speeding.
Speeding.
And all I have is his house,

216
00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:41.280
fucking mother fuckers.
All I have is my property.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

217
00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:45.230
And then these disrespectful punks parked that they were probably speeding.

218
00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.450
They weren't.
They were.
They all do,
dude.

219
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:52.100
These kids in your Mustang.
I don't

220
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.940
<v 0>know what this is here it says the diarrhea challenge.
Oh,</v>

221
00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.530
my wife refuses to eat my ass because she thinks it's gross.
Yeah,
of course.

222
00:14:59.531 --> 00:14:59.721
However,

223
00:14:59.721 --> 00:15:04.070
she has agreed to what I'm calling the no diarrhea challenge or if I can go 90

224
00:15:04.071 --> 00:15:06.260
days without having diarrhea,

225
00:15:06.261 --> 00:15:10.010
she will try it out and eat my ass for a full two minutes.
Problem is,

226
00:15:10.011 --> 00:15:15.011
I can't go more than 72 hours without my be whole doing an impersonation of the

227
00:15:16.011 --> 00:15:20.390
chocolate fountain.
That was at my sister's wedding.
Any advice?
Yeah,
man.

228
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.450
I mean I really am pulling for you here,
but I think number one,

229
00:15:23.451 --> 00:15:26.870
it's pretty obvious.
You need to change your diet dramatically.
See a doctor,

230
00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.850
you go see a doctor,
but make,
make diet changes for it.

231
00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:32.810
You might be able to solve it on your own.
All rights.
Ibs,

232
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:38.090
because our dog was having bouts of diarrhea.
The first thing to check is,

233
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.570
is your diet.
Check that diet.
You might be all right.

234
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.920
He might be lactose intolerant.
Yeah.

235
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.710
Or he just might be having like high fat or high five.
You know,
you just got to,

236
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.630
you gotta figure out what you're eating and maybe changing it.
Well,

237
00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:53.990
like when I eliminated sugar,
my dumps changed dramatically.
Yeah,

238
00:15:53.991 --> 00:15:56.780
you're very sensitive to sugar and fried foods.

239
00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:00.400
Think if we have a role at Sushi and it's,
there's fried in it,

240
00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:05.770
you get diarrhea immediately and then you're like,
I'm not eating it tonight.
Um,

241
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.010
oh,
I never eat your,
but for this,
especially those nights for the record,

242
00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:14.870
for the record,
those nights you're like,
no,
not anymore.
Never did.
Not Anymore.

243
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.690
This is a,
Oh,
this was our,

244
00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:23.980
I know we had our discussion about the numbers of money and Cooper k person.

245
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.330
Yeah,
something like that.
Conrad Conrad.
The lesson to remind people,

246
00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:34.160
the discussion was about how they were going to about to go out one night and

247
00:16:34.161 --> 00:16:35.900
the guy reminded the girl,

248
00:16:35.901 --> 00:16:39.770
he who he had just started dating a few weeks ago that she still owed him 50

249
00:16:39.771 --> 00:16:43.640
bucks and it created this very uncomfortable argument.

250
00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.870
Eventually basically led to them falling apart.
Yeah,

251
00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:52.010
so here is a an email about that.
I was listening to your podcast this week.

252
00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.350
Enjoy your discussion about the age gap.

253
00:16:54.351 --> 00:16:58.370
Couple on below deck in a variable that stuck out to me was that the gift in

254
00:16:58.371 --> 00:17:00.020
question was a carton of cigarettes.

255
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:05.480
The guy might not support hand has habit of smoking and not want to enable to a

256
00:17:05.481 --> 00:17:09.210
certain extent.
For me,
I'd eat the 50 bucks if it was dinner clothes,

257
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:14.060
but not cancer sticks.
However,
I'm not as European as he's boat employees.

258
00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.970
I also have not seen this season,
so maybe they both smoke.

259
00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:20.390
I love to hear your thoughts,
grace.
Yeah,
they do.
Actually both too.

260
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.870
They both smoked,
but that was an interesting thought on her part.

261
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:27.920
Then maybe he was a kind of whenever.
Yeah,
no he wasn't.

262
00:17:27.921 --> 00:17:32.340
He wanted to see much back.
Yeah,
he went his 50 bucks.
Poor I should say.

263
00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:37.700
Um,
I mean,
I don't know the working guy and he's not poor,

264
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.970
but when you were 21 or 2150 bucks is like,

265
00:17:40.971 --> 00:17:45.971
but poor implies basically unemployed and get buy in a box.

266
00:17:46.371 --> 00:17:49.860
And was,
he was being cheap.
That's true.
Um,
look,

267
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:52.830
<v 2>it's a real exciting day.
Let's just celebrate it.</v>

268
00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.860
<v 5>Okay.
Maybe you know me.
History.
She didn't husband.</v>

269
00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.740
I'm saying today is the day summary.
It's the queen's birthday.

270
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.480
So I'm taking over all our socials,

271
00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:07.490
asking you to post Hashtag happy birthday Tricia.
Hey,

272
00:18:07.491 --> 00:18:11.480
there's some cakes,
cupcakes,
but your favorite meal.

273
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:16.430
All she knows you like.
Okay.
And she loves you.
I love you.
Thank you.

274
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.060
<v 2>Oh yeah.
He's probably like you.
Who the fuck lit though?
Right?</v>

275
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:25.080
<v 5>Okay.
Can't tell you how great.
A weekend that was started in Portland.</v>

276
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:28.460
They were to Dallas now home to Nashville for some sleep.

277
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:32.400
We had a wonderful time.
Love you guys.
Thank you for everything.
Everything.

278
00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.740
<v 2>Can we start with the first one?
Yeah,
sure.
No,
I,</v>

279
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.700
here's the thing to the casual observer and,

280
00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:43.390
and I've been reposting these on Instagram and I read the comments and some

281
00:18:43.391 --> 00:18:47.320
people are like,
what a psycho dead behind the eyes.
I hundred percent crazy.

282
00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:50.770
And then there's the odd ball who's like,
well,
what's wrong with Garth?

283
00:18:50.771 --> 00:18:54.370
He seemed super nice and you're like,
you're missing the point.
But that's,

284
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.940
you're missing it person though that likes cats.
Yeah.

285
00:18:58.030 --> 00:18:59.140
You can't explain someone like that.

286
00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:01.340
There's like people who get it and then don't.
Yeah,
no,
I,

287
00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:04.060
I know I posted his stuff.
Yeah.

288
00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.850
I mean it was 90% like what?

289
00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:12.030
Fucking bloodthirsty maniac and six people were like,

290
00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:17.140
how dare you?
He's a saint.
I didn't believe that.
You don't,

291
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:20.980
you know,
like he's the greatest.
Well,
there's no debate.
Listen,

292
00:19:20.981 --> 00:19:23.080
we're not debating.
This man is talented.

293
00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.440
He's so talented and he's so successful and,

294
00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:30.580
and he's beloved by many.
There's no question about that.
However,

295
00:19:30.581 --> 00:19:35.240
I feel like he's being disingenuous when he does the social media posts because

296
00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:39.450
why he's,
he's not being him.
And you can tell it reads so false.

297
00:19:39.451 --> 00:19:43.690
Know why he's not.
Because he's a demon on the and side.
It's right.

298
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:46.510
He has a demon on the insight and he also darknesses there.

299
00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.950
He's so removed from regular people.
Yes.

300
00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.930
And he's been so famous.
First of all.
Yes.
Yes.
I know you're famous,

301
00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:56.770
but so famous.
Yes.

302
00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:01.780
For so long did he has no idea.
No,

303
00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.300
no idea how to connect with like he,

304
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:10.270
he's imagining like the,
the guy at the gas station,
he was like,
hey Garth.

305
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:14.680
And he's like,
I got to talk to that guy.
And he's always right.

306
00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:19.330
Big smiles are waves.
And
I remember me,

307
00:20:19.331 --> 00:20:22.900
I'm big fan.
I liked that you guys are fans too.
I'm a fan of you

308
00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:25.830
and of you.

309
00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:30.550
Well he's faking sincerity and mostly he's faking being humble.

310
00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.630
And I think that's what reads to me.
Like come on now,

311
00:20:34.631 --> 00:20:39.250
like you're faking and also the shit about,
I'm Mr Yearwood here.

312
00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:44.140
I'll Mr Yearwood,
which is so fucking condescending to the wife.

313
00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.010
It's so fucking condensate,
like first of all,
your fame level

314
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.380
<v 7>is just stratosphere.</v>

315
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:53.300
Like you're the top of the top of the food chain of showbusiness.
Dude.

316
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:57.990
Nobody rivals scarf,
I think in terms of like,
like he's amazing.
Yeah.

317
00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:02.470
So for him to be like,
ah,
I'm just a humble pie,
Mr here,
I'm misery.

318
00:21:02.471 --> 00:21:03.430
It's bold.

319
00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:04.530
<v 0>Well,</v>

320
00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:08.930
he has a triple digit body count and we don't know how many people he's killed.

321
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:12.680
Oh.
And I,
I feel like,
yeah.
Game recognize game cigarettes.

322
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:15.890
You dig up plots of land on his ranch.
Yeah.

323
00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.810
It's just mass graves.

324
00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:21.360
<v 7>Yeah.
We're crazy.
Train.
Yeah,
for sure.
Maybe not that,</v>

325
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:26.460
but maybe he's really mean behind closed doors.
Oh,
I see it.
Remember what he did?

326
00:21:26.461 --> 00:21:30.790
His happy birthday to G.
Oh yeah.
What's this?
What the fuck is it?
He's like,
yeah,

327
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:36.180
yeah.
Uh,
yeah.
Yeah.
Somebody interrupted him and he about lost his marbles.

328
00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:40.730
Yeah.
But what I find really condescending.
Yeah.
It's like,
ha ha ha,
ha.

329
00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.530
Mystery Hashtag happy Hashtag Mr Yearwood every,

right?

333
00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:59.130
I got it.
Oh there he is.
There he is.

Look at that.
Is that supposed to happen?

337
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:14.700
Is that supposed to happen?

338
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.500

340
00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.660
Do you think he said that to him on his birthday?

341
00:22:31.661 --> 00:22:34.860
Does he go through it and he's like,
yeah,

<v 7>He makes his staff is do things.</v>

344
00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.550
He makes a staff stand and like clap for him and shit when he comes in.

345
00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:51.790
I bet you got it.
Don't look at me policy.
Don't look at me.

347
00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:58.800
So it's the queen's birthday.

348
00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:03.120
The Queen's birthday association asking you to post Hashtag happy birthday

349
00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:07.240
Tricia.
I mean that country music is so weird though.
Yeah,

350
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:12.080
that's fucking Weirdos,
man.
It is all that insincere bullshit.
Light will come on.

351
00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.880
Y'All can stay at our house.
If it let me know if you ever need anything,

352
00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:18.320
which is all bullshit.
Yeah.
That's the part of it that's just so hard to,

353
00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.610
to click with,
cause they're just none of that.

354
00:23:20.611 --> 00:23:25.360
I never bought into any of that when I lived in Florida,
Carolina,
all that like,

355
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:29.100
but we're just real neighborly.
No,
you're not.
You're not because I don't know.

356
00:23:29.101 --> 00:23:31.320
I can't speak from experience.
I know.
I feel like,

357
00:23:31.321 --> 00:23:34.440
I feel like a lot of people are nice,
a lot of people are friendly,

358
00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:38.140
but people overstate how,
uh,

359
00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:42.210
what they are actually willing to do and what they like,

360
00:23:42.211 --> 00:23:46.100
what level of a friendly they're trying to,
and there's a lot

361
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.770
<v 2>of masking,
a real race.
Sure.
An emotional,</v>

362
00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:55.070
you know what it is because it's unacceptable to be mean or angry in that

363
00:23:55.071 --> 00:23:59.180
culture.
So everything's kind of backhanded,
like the,

364
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:02.030
bless her heart when the women are like,
well bless her heart.

365
00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:06.920
That's code for fuck you bitch.
You know.
Oh Hey.
Well,
just bless her heart.

366
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:10.400
That's really passive aggressive to say on your birthday.

367
00:24:10.401 --> 00:24:15.401
I'm definitely going to have people send photos of digital cakes and their

368
00:24:16.251 --> 00:24:20.100
favorite meals.
This virtual shots and cakes,
cupcakes,

369
00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:24.390
favorite meal waiver.
She knows you love her.
Okay.

370
00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:30.230
She loves you.
I love you thing.
What the fuck was that?
Dang.
What the fuck?

371
00:24:30.231 --> 00:24:32.090
Turn your goddamn phone off when you're recording me.

372
00:24:32.091 --> 00:24:36.620
You piece of Shit and you will notice that Tricia gets larger every year.

373
00:24:36.621 --> 00:24:40.550
She's with Garth.
I know.
No,
it's not the fat thing.

374
00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:45.230
It's that she's clearly not dealing with some feelings and I think it's because

375
00:24:45.231 --> 00:24:48.920
of Garth.
Garth has to be unbearable.
Just unbearable.

376
00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:53.060
It's so condescending.
Like why can't it's anyway.

377
00:24:53.061 --> 00:24:57.530
It's hard to be Mr Yearwood.
Mr Yearwood.

378
00:24:57.850 --> 00:24:59.450
How fucking bullshit.

379
00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:03.550
Can I tell you to any self respecting male would,

380
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:06.930
would you ever be like,
he know how I'm just Mr Pudge,
if

381
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:12.530
I was to be to see,
she did a great job on her degenerates.

382
00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:18.560
Make sure she knows you love her.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah,
sure.

383
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:21.840
Tell.
Tell him what to thank Tom.
You got God.

384
00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:26.000
You know Ms. Mr p I think he's just,

385
00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:31.050
I also maybe part of it is his age and not coming up in the digital era.

386
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:35.930
I get that and like doesn't know how to make a video.
No,

387
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:41.270
partially that it's that he probably has like a fucking team come in just to

388
00:25:41.271 --> 00:25:43.770
make that kind of shit.
Oh yeah.
Cause he,

389
00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.730
he doesn't understand how this is done at all.

390
00:25:46.731 --> 00:25:50.150
They should have made him watch a few peoples casual videos and then like you

391
00:25:50.151 --> 00:25:51.350
just talk to people casually.

392
00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:54.620
You don't have to rehearse in your head what you're going to say.
It does.

393
00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:01.670
Hashtag happy Hashtag Hash tag tag you're it and you're like said,

395
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.560

That's not part of the culture at all.
You're it,

396
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:17.420
you're the tit tag.
You're it.
That's what he means.
Expert in this house.

397
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.980
Here's an a question.

398
00:26:18.981 --> 00:26:22.730
Do your is my best friend and I are the opposite ends of the tip vagina
spectrum.

399
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:26.990
Okay.
We need your advice on what society deems the most desirable private part.

400
00:26:26.991 --> 00:26:31.820
Disposition.
She's a double d s l u t with dark brown nips.
Well,

401
00:26:31.821 --> 00:26:36.821
my handfuls tail is a door with light pink pokers blessed in our fruit.

402
00:26:36.861 --> 00:26:39.740
However,
we argue about society's nipple hierarchy.

403
00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:44.160
What is better pink or Brown?
She also has commented on that my high

404
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:49.020
<v 0>and tight clamshell is more desirable than her triple layer puffy Taco home
here.</v>

405
00:26:49.021 --> 00:26:50.760
Now,
Marissa,
by the way,

406
00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:55.510
<v 7>you're now a woman's email.
Yes.
I love it.
I love it.
Well,
I'll tell you,</v>

407
00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:59.590
coming from somebody that's had both colors,
a brie children,
I had a bank.

408
00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:03.910
Now they're brown and purposely,
no.
Huh?
I mean I'm not a guy.

409
00:27:03.911 --> 00:27:07.930
So you tell me Tommy,
I honestly feel like I,
I kind of like,

410
00:27:07.931 --> 00:27:11.800
I'm darker now cause before they,
I'm very pale under here.

411
00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:16.190
Very Alabaster,
so to have like light pink ones.
It was like I had no nips.
Yeah.

412
00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:18.400
But now they're gigantic and they really are.

413
00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:21.430
They stand out because of the color difference.
And I don't,
I like it.

414
00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:23.110
I think to change anything

415
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:25.050
<v 0>buddy,
that really,
like if you're,</v>

416
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:29.220
if a guys are really serious about their opinion on this,

417
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:30.240
it's kind of,

418
00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:34.200
it's kind of bullshit because like as long as there's Teddy's that you could

419
00:27:34.201 --> 00:27:38.200
smack and squeeze and squishing it down and hit stable,

420
00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:42.720
you can slice and do whatever you want to write.
I don't care about colors.

421
00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:47.280
Same thing.
Like she seems to have a real nice poon on her,
right?

422
00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:48.900
She's got a nice high end tie.

423
00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:52.080
Clamshell and her friends got a triple layer puffy taco.

424
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.810
But my thing is I could slide into either one.
Yeah.
Right.
So,

425
00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:02.100
yeah,
I mean maybe hers looks more appealing.
Right.
At the end of the day,

426
00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.740
I'm going to wear both like a surgeon,
the Basque,

427
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:07.830
and I'm just going to finish what I finish,
you know?

428
00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:12.580
<v 7>Yeah.
And I kind of wish,
um,
I used to have a bit about this that I stopped doing,</v>

429
00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:17.410
but I kind of wish women would stop torturing themselves with weight,

430
00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.530
with looks and with things of this nature.

431
00:28:20.531 --> 00:28:24.160
Like my vagina's a little sloppier looking than I've learned to,

432
00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:28.540
to just tortured Trisha Yearwood on her weight though.
Yeah,
but that's different.

433
00:28:28.541 --> 00:28:32.170
That's because I think she's in an emotional crisis.
I think it's about,

434
00:28:32.171 --> 00:28:35.110
it's not about the wage.
Do you think because she's held hostage?
Yeah.

435
00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:39.580
I think she fucking hates his guts and she's eating her feelings.

436
00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:42.910
That's what I think is going on.
So that's unhealthy.

437
00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:44.440
But I'm talking about with the girls that are like,

438
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:49.090
guys only like it when we're skinny.
Guys only will like me if I'm this weight.

439
00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:51.700
Here's the truth that I've learned.
Yeah.

440
00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:55.480
There's a guy out there who's going to love whatever it is you're offering.

441
00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.620
The straight ones.
The real dudes.
Yeah.

442
00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:03.760
Don't give a fuck.
They don't care about color of nipples.
Don't care.
Don't care.

443
00:29:03.761 --> 00:29:06.190
Really about the appearance of your posts.
Don't care.

444
00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.170
They just want to know that you're letting them in there.
Right?

445
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.980
So it's don't even think about this nonsense.
Younger girls,

446
00:29:11.981 --> 00:29:15.700
because guys don't care.
It's very true.
They just want you to love them.

447
00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:17.920
And like,
there'll be holes,

448
00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.640
which I'm waiting on

449
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:25.660
waiting on every day.
Never.

450
00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:31.520
<v 0>You want to step in and see,
uh,
your lady here,
your friend,
your bestie.</v>

451
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.823
Yeah.

452
00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:36.960
<v 8>To my [inaudible] had been cheated on by their men.
Snatch your phone.</v>

453
00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:41.040
Stop making it your fault to my kings up there that had been cheated on by their

454
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:45.850
stop making it your fault.
Yes.
Women she to then use the other thing,

455
00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:49.510
sex is one of the strongest forces in the universe that we have to deal with.

456
00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.040
This is about self mastery.

457
00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:53.770
It's not even about what's going on in the relationship.

458
00:29:53.771 --> 00:29:56.800
This is about self mastery.
Okay.

459
00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:00.400
So if you think just because somebody says they love you or you think just

460
00:30:00.401 --> 00:30:02.020
because they want to be in a relationship with you,

461
00:30:02.021 --> 00:30:04.840
that that means that that's going to dissolve all their traumas that they come

462
00:30:04.841 --> 00:30:06.970
with.
You know what I'm saying?

463
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.740
And that they're going to know how to deal with their traumas.
Ah.

464
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:14.260
People gone mess up.
I really liked that.

465
00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:18.480
<v 0>She's so pretty.
She's very pretty.
Yes.</v>

466
00:30:18.481 --> 00:30:22.620
My kings and Queens.
So you've got to find someone who's worth it.

467
00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:26.090
Self masturbation.
Oh,
let me see as our guest here,

468
00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:31.080
she's talking about masturbating,
Tom.
Oh,
studio g's all over the place.

469
00:30:31.081 --> 00:30:32.880
We a day.
Okay.

470
00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:38.030
Let's take a quick break and we're back and we are here with our guest who is a

471
00:30:40.231 --> 00:30:42.620
comedienne.
Okay.
What is that?

472
00:30:42.621 --> 00:30:46.680
Is Star of some multiple television shows?
A writer,

473
00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.460
producer,
director,
I mean

474
00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:53.520
<v 9>rapper,
rapper,
choreographer,
she film star</v>

475
00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.860
<v 0>does it all.
It is Ms. Whitney Cummings,
what's your pronoun?</v>

476
00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:01.770
<v 9>Do we say comic or comedian?</v>

477
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.300
I would say I still always does that

478
00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:10.710
<v 0>comic,
but whenever there's a female I like to make a big</v>

479
00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:11.653
<v 9>point that,</v>

480
00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:17.160
and I would just say Comedienne lady come lady comic comedian.

481
00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:22.680
<v 0>Like what old school guys will say to make sure that</v>

482
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:27.190
<v 9>the disclosure,
there's two,
I'm not going to say who they ride with.</v>

483
00:31:27.191 --> 00:31:31.930
Carbon Rom.
Um,
guys an nd when you do their show,

484
00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:34.950
they're Lego lady comedian.

485
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:40.030
And it's so like when I first started standing up and probably still like up

486
00:31:40.031 --> 00:31:42.470
until a couple of years ago when someone would,
you know,

487
00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:45.520
the comedy store is just kind of like bring up other comics and then what is it

488
00:31:45.521 --> 00:31:47.090
my turn to go out of?
I'm sure there's avenues.

489
00:31:47.091 --> 00:31:51.790
Like are you guys ready for a lady?
What does that even mean?

490
00:31:51.791 --> 00:31:55.060
And then it just cues everyone to get up to go to the bathroom.
Oh God.

491
00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:59.900
<v 0>There's also that thing where you get brought up,
you know,</v>

492
00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:01.800
no one ever brings me up as lovely.

493
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:09.000
<v 9>It is gorgeous.
Lovely lady.</v>

494
00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:11.580
Lovely guy.
He's so handsome.

495
00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:16.650
There was one time Tommy and I did a gig together when we were like year seven

496
00:32:16.651 --> 00:32:18.750
and stand up and we showed up together.

497
00:32:18.751 --> 00:32:22.680
We were both performing that night and the booker goes to me,
you're a comedian.

498
00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:27.060
And Tom to his credit stands up for me.
And he goes,
Jesus man,
what is this?

499
00:32:27.061 --> 00:32:31.260
The 1950s and you busted his balls.
And I was like,
wow,
that was so,

500
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:35.440
it happens so much to me that was like,
I didn't,

501
00:32:35.441 --> 00:32:40.100
I was in Houston,
I guess this was like eight,
nine years ago.

502
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:43.400
It was Tom Arnold was doing standup I guess at the time.

503
00:32:43.401 --> 00:32:48.140
And he asked me and Dalea to go with them and we went and did like he hosted and

504
00:32:48.141 --> 00:32:52.790
we did stand up and the booker when I went on stage,
smack my ass like,

505
00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:55.880
like hurt.
Chris Thought Chris was there.

506
00:32:55.881 --> 00:32:58.840
He saw and I started laughing because I just was like,
hey,

507
00:32:58.841 --> 00:33:02.360
like I didn't even know what to do.
I like,
it was just like,

508
00:33:02.361 --> 00:33:06.410
I don't have time to even process how screwed up this is.
Like I just was like,

509
00:33:06.411 --> 00:33:08.030
Hey,
and like my butt,

510
00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:13.031
like horror and stung because I had like rug burn on my bud hall and I was like,

511
00:33:13.671 --> 00:33:16.610
this is insane.
And then I just remembered it like a year ago and I was like,

512
00:33:16.611 --> 00:33:20.660
that was fucked up.
I know.
You remember in hindsight,
do that too.

513
00:33:20.661 --> 00:33:25.420
You know,
male booker would smack your ass.
Um,

514
00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:29.870
we'd love Chris Taleah by the way.
I best he was here.
He's the great,

515
00:33:29.871 --> 00:33:32.370
you guys had your show together.
Yeah.
Wait.
Yeah,
we just shutting up there.
Yeah.

516
00:33:32.371 --> 00:33:37.040
Yeah.
I wrote it with him in mind.
This is before anything and I just was at like,

517
00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:38.310
um,
when,

518
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:43.280
when you rode with him in mind and when you tell NBC like are they like,

519
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:47.330
I was very manipulative about it because I was like,

520
00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:51.750
I'd never done anything before.
You know,
I was like a filthy like comic.

521
00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:53.900
Like I was going to be like,
these are my demands that,
you know,

522
00:33:53.901 --> 00:33:56.810
so I had to audition like 300 guys.

523
00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:01.310
None of them were taller than me.
I mean,
it's all right.
How tall are you?

524
00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:04.070
I'm five.
10.
I actually got shorter recently.

525
00:34:04.071 --> 00:34:06.650
I went to the doctor and they're like,
you're five,
eight.
And I was like,
no,

526
00:34:06.651 --> 00:34:11.330
I'm fine.
Like this business has just beat me.
I'm just losing like my,

527
00:34:11.331 --> 00:34:15.740
just my spine.
Wait until you have a baby.
Your field grow and you'll get shorter.

528
00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:16.973
How do we,

529
00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:20.090
we've talked about this before and we were talking to you about showbusiness

530
00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:24.470
before we ran the hit record here,
but we always felt like I'm serious.

531
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:29.710
Like Whitney Cummings really understands like how everything works.

532
00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.590
She should have a seminar on fucking show you up.

533
00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:38.300
Is it the ones getting millions of hits on your podcast and I'm writing scripts

534
00:34:38.301 --> 00:34:41.420
and are getting picked humble and I'm like,
Oh shit,

535
00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.480
we're talking about like early on it was,

536
00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:50.740
I remember you being on roasts and I felt like you going from rose to television

537
00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.880
I gave you,
I was like,
this is a calculated move on Whitney's part.

538
00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:59.480
She knows to move the chess piece here and there.
And I was like,

539
00:34:59.481 --> 00:35:03.110
I don't know how she knows she knows I the roasts.

540
00:35:03.111 --> 00:35:06.710
Actually I was a writer on the roasts from remember that,
you know?
And they said,

541
00:35:06.711 --> 00:35:09.260
no,
I tried to be a writer.
They were like,
no,
I just like sending them.

542
00:35:09.261 --> 00:35:12.860
I like made them hire me and then they booked me for one roast.

543
00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:16.820
It was Larry the cable guy and I was like so excited and then they said no.
Like,

544
00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:19.880
it's just when people say,
think that I have had a good career,

545
00:35:19.881 --> 00:35:23.810
like they just don't know about all the fat because for every one when you get

546
00:35:23.811 --> 00:35:27.890
50 failures,
but no one promotes it,
no one,
there's no like,
you know,

547
00:35:27.891 --> 00:35:32.820
news articles that are like,
so show not picked up.
Nobody can I tell you about.

548
00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:35.360
So like,
I don't know when we were,
I don't know.

549
00:35:35.361 --> 00:35:38.100
We're both kind of opened makers around same time.
I feel like

550
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.113
<v 7>we were,</v>

551
00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:43.440
I know we were just hitting every laundromat bowling.

552
00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:46.710
But here's the difference between Whitney Cummings and Christina P.

553
00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.540
I remember one night in silver lake,

554
00:35:48.541 --> 00:35:52.610
there was some dog shit dive bar and it was racist.

555
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:56.280
Maybe not,
not,
no,
no,
no.
It was,
I don't even know if the place exists anymore.

556
00:35:56.281 --> 00:35:59.820
And it was an open Mike,
Someone's house.
There's so much shit.
And uh,

557
00:35:59.821 --> 00:36:02.940
and it was raining.
And so all that showed up were comedians because in La,

558
00:36:02.941 --> 00:36:05.940
when it rains,
the audience doesn't come out right.
And I remember going up,

559
00:36:05.941 --> 00:36:10.140
no one's here later,
I'm going to go get drunk and fuck around.
And she goes,
no,

560
00:36:10.141 --> 00:36:13.590
Whitney coming.
She's,
you know,
we're all like fucking late twenties.
She goes,

561
00:36:13.591 --> 00:36:16.710
all right,
well let's workshop guys,
come on,
let's just work,
shop our jokes.

562
00:36:16.711 --> 00:36:21.360
And I was like,
God,
that's the difference between Whitney and me.
I'm like,

563
00:36:21.361 --> 00:36:24.230
I'm going to go get hammered inlaid with Tommy.

564
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.570
Yeah,
like that.
It's hammered them hammered and then does that get fucked up?

565
00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.160
I didn't get laid sober.
Don't worry.

566
00:36:32.161 --> 00:36:35.270
I don't even remember who they were or now I got to get ripped before I fucked

567
00:36:35.271 --> 00:36:37.400
this guy.
Um,
but that's a difference.

568
00:36:37.401 --> 00:36:41.630
And I think like that's what we all were like,
damn.
Like she knows the matrix,

569
00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:44.080
the matrix.
How did you know the Matrix already?

570
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:48.140
I went to flappers the other night cause that's where I go like try out new

571
00:36:48.141 --> 00:36:51.510
stuff.
It's nice in Burbank and nobody showed up.
It's my shit.

572
00:36:51.511 --> 00:36:53.810
And nobody showed up and were like four open microphone.
I was like,

573
00:36:53.811 --> 00:36:56.750
can I just run these premises while you guys all right.

574
00:36:57.230 --> 00:37:00.500
I think like I was just so afraid of being bad.

575
00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:04.670
I was just so afraid of not being good.
And I think when you come up as a female,

576
00:37:04.671 --> 00:37:05.780
you're already so hazed,

577
00:37:05.781 --> 00:37:09.050
or at least at the time I had a lot of girls and it was like you have to,

578
00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:11.880
I felt like you had to be twice as funny.
You know?

579
00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:15.620
I was also so nervous on stage when I started,

580
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:18.350
like I didn't have that natural charisma.
Like I just,

581
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:22.250
you know how sometimes like there's comics who can on paper do jokes that

582
00:37:22.251 --> 00:37:23.840
wouldn't necessarily make you laugh on paper,

583
00:37:23.841 --> 00:37:26.180
but with their charisma and with how good of a performer they are.

584
00:37:26.181 --> 00:37:27.860
Like I wasn't a good performer yet,

585
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:32.330
so I just felt like the jokes had to be so good that they had to,

586
00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:35.510
you know,
override the fact that you were a hard worker.

587
00:37:35.511 --> 00:37:38.450
But then also at Tommy saying like the business side of it,

588
00:37:38.451 --> 00:37:40.870
you seem to know like,
oh my God,
if I do this,

589
00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:45.880
I also thought because you had so much going on,
I was like,

590
00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:48.170
one of the things that a lot of people struggle with,

591
00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:53.200
and I think especially Comedians,
is having the audacity to say,
I want this,

592
00:37:53.201 --> 00:37:56.450
this and this.
And in my mind you were,
you knew.

593
00:37:56.750 --> 00:38:00.470
That's so interesting because I feel like I'm always like,
no,
you go,
you go,

594
00:38:00.471 --> 00:38:04.070
I'm good.
Like I feel you know,
really.
So I that was like,

595
00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:06.860
I mean when I was doing the roasts,
I mean,
you know,

596
00:38:06.861 --> 00:38:09.880
it's weird that the fact that someone gets successful off the roast because it

597
00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:12.790
works.
People,
they were,
especially back then in context,

598
00:38:12.791 --> 00:38:16.340
like that time that was like the biggest thing happening in comedy where the

599
00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.350
they like matter.
Yeah.
I mean even now,

600
00:38:18.351 --> 00:38:21.100
like they'll go like four years without one and then all of a sudden they get

601
00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:24.650
huge ratings because they can have it back.
The roasts work for comedy central,

602
00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:28.840
it was like the Superbowl was like the Oscars for the comedy world kind of,

603
00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:31.820
you know?
And which is tricky because it's hard.

604
00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:35.440
I think that part of the reason that's a new person does so well because no

605
00:38:35.441 --> 00:38:36.370
one's heard of him before,

606
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:36.670
<v 9>you know,</v>

607
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:39.430
and they just come out of nowhere and they can't really slam you on much because

608
00:38:39.431 --> 00:38:42.790
you don't have,
all the jokes are like,
who the fuck are,
you know?

609
00:38:42.791 --> 00:38:45.790
And then like sludge jokes,
which for women.
Yeah,
totally.

610
00:38:45.791 --> 00:38:49.030
You're putting your Lisa Lampanelli,
he's pussy,
right?
Well it was like her,

611
00:38:49.031 --> 00:38:53.270
that was a lot of Cox,
which by the way,
and then she's married to a white guy.

612
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.710
It's like you vote black guy.
She's like,
yeah,
you know,

613
00:38:56.711 --> 00:39:00.250
it's like you just grab whatever you can and uh,

614
00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:04.210
and then I did a special for them and I think that's the thing.

615
00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.450
And they did warn me to give me an hour and I was like fought to get an hour

616
00:39:07.451 --> 00:39:10.830
cause I didn't get this.
So that's what I'm talking about.

617
00:39:10.831 --> 00:39:15.220
This so inside baseball,
but three months prior I didn't get live at Gotham.
Wow.

618
00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:19.200
Which like,
it could be something like 150 comics.
Got It.
This is what I'm saying.

619
00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:23.230
Never Know Montreal.
I know I like,
I never got the things that everyone got.

620
00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:26.870
Like I just felt like I never could get in.
So I just,
the way the way,

621
00:39:26.871 --> 00:39:30.100
but then how did you know,
how did you have the sense of like,
yeah,

622
00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:33.500
I didn't get Gotham but I want an hour is when I'm asking.

623
00:39:33.501 --> 00:39:34.420
Cause I had like worked my,

624
00:39:34.421 --> 00:39:38.350
I had been getting nothing for so long that I had accumulated so much material.

625
00:39:38.351 --> 00:39:40.840
I hadn't burned out.
I hadn't burned any of it,
you know,

626
00:39:40.841 --> 00:39:44.440
like I had done the tonight show I think,
or something like when it was Leno,

627
00:39:44.441 --> 00:39:48.540
when he like Conan got it.
And that like,
but I wasn't getting for like,

628
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:52.690
I wasn't getting anything,
so I just had so many chunks of 15 minutes,
you know,

629
00:39:52.691 --> 00:39:53.530
and I was doing the road,

630
00:39:53.531 --> 00:39:57.910
I was opening for Steve Byrne and Bobby Lee and Craig Shoemaker.
Wow.
I know.

631
00:39:57.911 --> 00:40:00.220
So I just had a bunch of material,
but I just,

632
00:40:00.221 --> 00:40:02.380
so I felt like I'd been struggling tooth and nail.

633
00:40:02.381 --> 00:40:03.820
And by the time I did the NBC show,

634
00:40:03.821 --> 00:40:07.720
I had written two pilots that hadn't gotten picked up.
Um,

635
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:11.020
I had written specs for pilots that didn't even exist.

636
00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:13.720
Dane Cook had done a Spec or a,
I'm sorry,

637
00:40:13.721 --> 00:40:16.080
a pilot at UPN and network that doesn't even exist anymore.

638
00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:19.480
And I'd written a Spec like I was just always writing sort of pilots cause I was

639
00:40:19.481 --> 00:40:20.890
like,
I don't think anyone's going to give this to me.

640
00:40:20.891 --> 00:40:24.660
Like I just have to create my own opportunities and I was too weird to get cast

641
00:40:24.661 --> 00:40:25.121
in anything.

642
00:40:25.121 --> 00:40:29.360
I was always like too shrill or too tall or like I wasn't the like yeah

643
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.690
girlfriend.
Yeah.
Like I just was like,

644
00:40:31.691 --> 00:40:33.430
I would always get feedback that was just like you're,

645
00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:37.510
I remember an agent at ICM was like,
you're never going to be a leading lady.

646
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:40.780
Wow.
He was like,
well,
which is interesting cause he was like,

647
00:40:40.781 --> 00:40:44.160
you're going to be like at best like Elisa Cuadro and I was like,

648
00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:49.050
you mean the best accurate hero?
Like Ra are you trying to as part of,

649
00:40:49.051 --> 00:40:51.070
are you trying to hurt my,
yeah,
they should.
They were just like,

650
00:40:51.071 --> 00:40:53.860
you're too quirky.
Like you're too.
So I was just like,

651
00:40:53.861 --> 00:40:56.890
I think I have to do this on my own because no one is going to enter Jada.

652
00:40:56.891 --> 00:41:01.270
Pinkett like came out.
And you were like,
that's right.

653
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:05.670
I mean the Jadah I need that.
I need her I think is by the way,
it's so crazy.

654
00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:06.240
I remember

655
00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:11.110
<v 0>being,
I was in [inaudible],
I was in Melbourne,
Australia with,
um,
Hannibal.</v>

656
00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:14.890
Yeah.
And we were talking,
I was like,
yeah.
Oh yeah.
My,

657
00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:19.180
my half hour had come out,
like I always central half hour to come out,
uh,

658
00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:23.410
four or five months prior.
Yeah.
And we were talking and I was like,
yeah,

659
00:41:23.411 --> 00:41:27.420
so you're going to try to do the the half hour,
uh,
on this next round.

660
00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:31.310
He was like,
I think we're just going to go for the hour.
And I was like,
why?
Yeah.

661
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:34.010
So crazy,
right?
You mean?
He's like,

662
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:37.370
<v 9>yeah,
we're just going to go for the,
I'm like,
you can do that.
And he was like,</v>

663
00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:41.210
I mean,
I guess we're going to try.
I was like,
that's,
that to me,
blew my mind.

664
00:41:41.211 --> 00:41:43.380
I was like,
you're going to skip that part.
Yeah.

665
00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.660
Like you don't get to jump the line.

666
00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:48.320
It was just like the kind of thing where it's like they had fucking,

667
00:41:48.321 --> 00:41:52.190
three months later he shot it I way they had said no to me for so long.

668
00:41:52.191 --> 00:41:54.650
I didn't get premium blend.
I didn't get live at Gotham.

669
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:59.690
I didn't get out that shit.
I never,
never got it.
And I was driving out to Irvine,

670
00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:02.420
like,
you know,
putting in hair extensions in the car.

671
00:42:02.421 --> 00:42:04.730
I mean I was the hustling and like nothing.

672
00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:07.190
And I almost feel like at the time that was like my,

673
00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.420
like what you guys do when you're like,

674
00:42:08.421 --> 00:42:10.640
I'm just gonna take matters into my own hands and I'm just going to shoot

675
00:42:10.641 --> 00:42:13.670
podcast and I'm going to go directly to my people like that.
I was like,

676
00:42:13.671 --> 00:42:16.400
if you just give this to me,
I can find my people,
you know?

677
00:42:16.401 --> 00:42:17.780
And I had a little bit of leverage I guess,

678
00:42:17.781 --> 00:42:19.500
cause I had just done the roast and they wanted to kind of,
yeah,

679
00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.440
when you have the leverage,
you've got a book.

680
00:42:21.441 --> 00:42:23.120
Fucking really got to do it when you got you.

681
00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:27.620
I know you gotta you gotta be with someone and you gotta be willing to say no.

682
00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:30.380
Yeah.
Oh yeah,
you learn for me when we say no,

683
00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:34.460
that's what years so cause he was like,
oh I just,
anyone that talks to me,

684
00:42:34.461 --> 00:42:38.230
I just am like thank you.
Thank you that you know,
it was a big,
I don't know,

685
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:42.320
a reward for me to say no to is an audition that I'm like,

686
00:42:42.321 --> 00:42:45.890
I don't want to fucking go out in that.
And I'm like,
what?
I used to be like,

687
00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:49.040
I think I don't want to go out on it.
And they're like,
you should go.

688
00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:52.160
And I was like,
all right,
I'll,
I'll be there.
I'll be there.
And now I'm like,

689
00:42:52.161 --> 00:42:54.890
I don't want to read for this bullshit.
And they're like,
okay,

690
00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:58.250
you don't even want to go for the one day.
What if you get it?

691
00:42:58.251 --> 00:43:01.590
You have to spend eight years doing it.
No,
no.
You know what I mean?
Those at all.

692
00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:05.300
I didn't even want to go for 20 minutes.
You know what if I get this,

693
00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:07.930
what if I get,
this was all it was.
The thing is,
I,

694
00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:11.690
I'm always amazed by how many agents think the,

695
00:43:11.691 --> 00:43:15.470
what if I get it is like why are we having that conversation?
I'm like,

696
00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:18.320
that's the point of going no.
Then they go to me it will cause I'm like,

697
00:43:18.321 --> 00:43:21.050
we can always say no,
but that's three days.
Why would I do that?

698
00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:24.200
I have shit to do.
I always like,
where's this shoot?
And they're like,

699
00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:29.720
I could find out,
find out,
always find out because I want to know if I'm moving.

700
00:43:29.721 --> 00:43:32.410
And then they're like,
okay,
yeah,
yeah.
Does shooting from,

701
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:36.200
we don't think you're going to get it.
Cause like why,
why would I go,

702
00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.130
you're just doing this to seem like you're doing your job.
But you know,

703
00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.350
I don't even have,
I don't even go out on them ever.

704
00:43:42.351 --> 00:43:45.680
I don't even have an agent for theatrical smell so bad.

705
00:43:45.681 --> 00:43:49.250
Everything's sucks so bad.
It hurt your feelings every time.
They're like,
hey,

706
00:43:49.251 --> 00:43:51.230
the money for this,
you know,

707
00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:55.100
you get the script and it's like grandmother,

708
00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:59.870
Alcoholic Gray,
like you're just hurting my feelings.

709
00:43:59.871 --> 00:44:03.230
40 she's like fucking everyone at the funeral.
Like that's what I get.

710
00:44:03.231 --> 00:44:05.610
And they're like,
they love you for this.
And I'm like,
I don't even,

711
00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:08.600
I don't get is the right direction.
I want to write our own shit.

712
00:44:08.601 --> 00:44:11.980
That's why I went to cvs.
It's like I'd rather write the vehicle for us.

713
00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:16.340
I waited for that,
for,
for that.
Yes.
That's not to fucking,
they're not going to,

714
00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:20.660
I'm not the neighbor.
I'm not the fucking the fuck machine girl anyway.

715
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:24.290
I don't even try out what's the point?
And um,
you know,

716
00:44:24.291 --> 00:44:28.490
and it's also thinking about like,
who are the great comics?
They were like,

717
00:44:28.491 --> 00:44:29.660
oh yeah,
they got cast in that thing.

718
00:44:29.661 --> 00:44:32.970
Like this Gal Finacle like that's a great example.

719
00:44:32.971 --> 00:44:35.970
Like he was already doing standup,
but it was something that he made his own.

720
00:44:35.971 --> 00:44:38.700
Anyway,
Todd Phillips was like,
do your thing,
but it's very,

721
00:44:38.701 --> 00:44:42.420
you're not like Jerry Seinfeld got cast in that incredible show and then he did

722
00:44:42.421 --> 00:44:45.690
his own show.
Like that's never been anyone's trajectory.

723
00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:48.690
Like Mary Rice Gob did that.
She's amazing.

724
00:44:48.691 --> 00:44:53.610
Like she did that 24 show and was like,
great,
but made it her own special thing.

725
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:57.750
But I don't think anyone sort of popped off of doing someone else's thing.

726
00:44:57.751 --> 00:45:02.100
She was constantly marrying,
making it up instantly.
No,
you're right.

727
00:45:02.101 --> 00:45:04.110
You have to make it your own.
I think it's like,
dude,

728
00:45:04.111 --> 00:45:06.000
did you see their special is amazing.
Oh,

729
00:45:06.001 --> 00:45:10.200
and they're on that show sometimes Patton Oswald,

730
00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:12.750
he was like on other shows,
but no one's like,
yeah,
I love him on that show.

731
00:45:12.751 --> 00:45:14.100
You'll ease standups.
Amazing.

732
00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:20.350
I'm not too long ago where the description was very detailed for a nerdy

733
00:45:20.671 --> 00:45:25.040
computer guy.
I'm like,
God,
Amen.
Don't you think?
Let me,

734
00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:27.060
I realized acting is not playing yourself,

735
00:45:27.061 --> 00:45:30.810
but do you think they'll get like the nerdy computer looking guy?
Yeah,

736
00:45:30.811 --> 00:45:35.710
they'll call Kevin Christie.
Yeah,
you should just,
you should go in.

737
00:45:35.711 --> 00:45:39.410
And I was like,
no,
cause I,
I know they're going to,

738
00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:43.140
but a lot of it is like casting director,
like having been on both sides.

739
00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:45.660
A lot of his casting director is like fan.
They like you,

740
00:45:45.661 --> 00:45:48.180
they just want to see you like,
and then it's like,
well no,

741
00:45:48.181 --> 00:45:49.320
they'll cast you in something else.
It's like,

742
00:45:49.321 --> 00:45:53.100
I don't have time to go on weird dates.
I got a lot going on in Van Nuys.
Oh.

743
00:45:53.101 --> 00:45:57.160
And also if I see in the character description sexy,
I'm like,
like,

744
00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.570
have you seen anything?
Like,
I like,
like,

745
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:04.530
I like it when they try to make it so she's not pretty in the description.

746
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:08.730
It's like not a threat,
you know?
It's always something that's like,

747
00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:13.430
not going to steal your man,
but like,
yeah,

748
00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:19.380
I love that.
Also,
it's super insulting when it's like,
it's like,
you know,
Lindsay,

749
00:46:19.381 --> 00:46:24.240
25 smart.
It's like you think I assumed a woman wouldn't be smart,

750
00:46:24.241 --> 00:46:28.080
so you will have to qualify.
Yeah,
smart.
Down to Earth.
It's like,
you know,

751
00:46:28.081 --> 00:46:30.840
some women just are that.
Well,
that's the other thing too,

752
00:46:30.841 --> 00:46:33.930
is that they really don't.
Right.
Am I still,
they still write us very well,

753
00:46:33.931 --> 00:46:37.910
so I'm like,
I'd rather write my own thing and do that.
Then wait for it.

754
00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:45.290
Make sure you're with someone that is interested in mastering themselves and

755
00:46:46.231 --> 00:46:47.670
everything that they come with.

756
00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:51.720
And I know that there's a lot of pain that comes with infidelity,

757
00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:55.770
but relationships is a spiritual endeavor.

758
00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:58.010
Just make sure you with somebody who's worth,

759
00:46:58.710 --> 00:47:03.710
so we got engaged recently and that's why we wanted to bring Jada pink into the

760
00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:07.380
mix here.
Keith or can I just really quick,
sorry.

761
00:47:07.381 --> 00:47:09.330
I'm always to have the wrong takeaway.

762
00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:11.280
I'm always the one when you just show me a photo.
I'm like,

763
00:47:11.281 --> 00:47:12.360
what's that thing in the background?

764
00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:17.420
Like I watched two different earrings so she had so much money that she's just

765
00:47:17.551 --> 00:47:22.000
like,
I got to,
I know I can't decide which jewels to where is so pretty.

766
00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:25.840
Why does she look?
She's Benjamin Button and why does she look 20 now?

767
00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.710
It's like find someone that can,
like if I looked like you,

768
00:47:28.711 --> 00:47:33.711
I wouldn't have to take your money and you should see her mom gammy on red table

769
00:47:34.271 --> 00:47:37.870
talk.
Gammy looks better than I of us,
which has a six pack.

770
00:47:37.871 --> 00:47:41.790
Her mom has a six pack.
Do you do with skincare video?
I don't care.

771
00:47:41.791 --> 00:47:43.620
I don't need your relationship and flights

772
00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:49.930
she hates will bring up.
Yeah.
Why don't you bring up infidelity lot.
It felt like,

773
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:52.670
okay.
That just felt like a weird,
like no one was thinking about that.

774
00:47:52.671 --> 00:47:57.230
A lot of resentment I did.
What am I in for?
It's awesome.
Yeah,

775
00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:01.340
we've been married.
Our 10 year anniversary is coming up November and ears.

776
00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:05.710
That's crazy.
Together or like,
yeah,
like a bunch of years.
I feel like before,

777
00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:09.580
I remember seeing you guys at like Jerry's Deli in the valley,

778
00:48:09.581 --> 00:48:11.890
but remember there was that,
that comedy on a box.

779
00:48:11.891 --> 00:48:13.600
You did comedy on like a China mob,

780
00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:16.030
like you would look down at the people eating.

781
00:48:16.031 --> 00:48:18.730
They're like Salami or whatever and I remember you guys and I'm like,
oh,

782
00:48:18.731 --> 00:48:21.460
they're to get like comics dating.
I was like,
that's never going to work.

783
00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:26.830
Calmly stated comments.
Good luck with that and here you are.
You get,
wait,
sorry.

784
00:48:26.831 --> 00:48:29.630
Did you Mary,
are you marrying a comedian or a lay person?

785
00:48:29.631 --> 00:48:33.550
He's not a comic as a lay person.
He's a pedestrian.
I don't.

786
00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:36.430
I had no idea it was going to happen.
I was,

787
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:41.290
we had met on the Internet long distance.
We met on a dating app,

788
00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:45.180
totally
behind him.

789
00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:49.240
It's like you have to like get accepted.
It's like what?
It's all like Hollywood.

790
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:52.360
It's all like the dudes in Hollywood I've been trying to avoid for the past 15

791
00:48:52.361 --> 00:48:55.380
years.
It's like pivot and Matthew pair.
It's like,
Oh God,

792
00:48:55.381 --> 00:48:57.970
these are all the people I've been trying to avoid hearing Matthew Perry's name

793
00:48:57.971 --> 00:49:02.080
a lot on it.
What's it like?

794
00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:05.370
What is the guy who hits up Whitney Cummings now?

795
00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:10.440
You know what's funny is when I was on Tinder for a while to smash and I,

796
00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:13.630
and I,
uh,
because I was like,
what's the difference when meeting someone at a bar?

797
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:15.820
Like it's,
it might be safe or I can get to know them.

798
00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:20.200
And then one time I had this guy meet me at the comedy store and just to be
like,

799
00:49:20.201 --> 00:49:22.960
okay,
this could be dangerous to meet me in the comedy.
So like what could happen?

800
00:49:22.961 --> 00:49:24.430
And he was gonna come see a show or whatever.

801
00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:28.960
And then I saw him and we were texting for like three,
four weeks.

802
00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.960
He sees me and I'm like,
hey.
And he was like,

803
00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:36.670
I didn't think it was really going to be you.
And I was like,
what?

804
00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:40.270
Like first of all,
who,
if someone was going to impersonate someone that,

805
00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:43.570
why would they pick me?
Like I'm not as a standup comic,

806
00:49:43.571 --> 00:49:48.430
but also like was he like wanted to be catfished I think.

807
00:49:48.431 --> 00:49:51.400
I think it was like,
I was like,
no,
I'm like,

808
00:49:51.401 --> 00:49:54.250
so you prefer to have the person pretending?
Like he was just like,

809
00:49:54.251 --> 00:49:57.430
can I get a picture?
Like it was very weird.
And then he just like left.

810
00:49:57.431 --> 00:49:59.530
I thought we were like going on a date.
So I was like,

811
00:49:59.531 --> 00:50:03.700
I think this is probably sketchy.
So then I went on this other one,

812
00:50:03.701 --> 00:50:06.250
which is kind of people that are sort of in our field in some way.

813
00:50:06.251 --> 00:50:09.030
Like my guy works advice,
he's not in our business.
Um,

814
00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:13.330
but we started texting is not Shane Black?
No,
I would not be here.

815
00:50:13.331 --> 00:50:16.990
I would be in France on a boat somewhere.
Um,
but uh,

816
00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:20.770
he is super cool.
He like had sort of knew about me but wasn't,
he's like,

817
00:50:20.771 --> 00:50:22.180
I've seen you on talk shows.
He's like,

818
00:50:22.181 --> 00:50:24.440
I don't really know because when people say like,
I've never heard of you,

819
00:50:24.441 --> 00:50:27.410
and you're like,
I have to say like,

820
00:50:27.411 --> 00:50:30.380
go out of your way to be arrogant.
But it's just sort of like,

821
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:34.000
you definitely went to my Instagram from this.
Like,
you know what I do?

822
00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:39.200
Have you ever met a comedian who's like a big comedian?
And they're like,
oh,
hi.

823
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:44.270
Um,
uh,
what's up?
You Google me every day and you're like,
hey man,

824
00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:49.610
what are you,
uh,
are you a comic?
And you're like,
you come on.

825
00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:55.160
And then they're like,
uh,
are you,
uh,
opening for someone here?
And you're like,
no,

826
00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:59.360
I'm not.
And then you're like,
okay,
we're on the same poster.

827
00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:04.790
Like,
come on man.
I love that.

828
00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:08.570
I also love the backhanded compliments you get offstage.
Oh God.

829
00:51:08.571 --> 00:51:12.110
We talk about this with the lean maniac about this by the way.

830
00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:17.740
I get so fired up about,
about the,
uh,
the people that give the backhanded today.

831
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:19.340
That's my favorite shit.
Oh yeah.

832
00:51:19.341 --> 00:51:22.700
We've talked about it constantly is the craziest cause he's just,

833
00:51:22.701 --> 00:51:25.430
the building is shaped but it's like I'll get off stage and someone's like weird

834
00:51:25.431 --> 00:51:29.720
crowd and you're like,
what?
Like don't do it.
It's like such a subtle,

835
00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:33.080
yeah,
like you're too smart for them.

836
00:51:33.081 --> 00:51:38.081
They tried to give you a compliment as a way to insult you just went over their

837
00:51:38.181 --> 00:51:40.390
heads but I thought I did.
I just did great.

838
00:51:40.410 --> 00:51:43.460
Yeah I forgot about that one or that will,

839
00:51:43.461 --> 00:51:45.800
maybe it's this one when you come off stage and you kill and they're like great

840
00:51:45.801 --> 00:51:49.210
crowd and you're like,
no,
the crowd didn't do that work.
Right.

841
00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:55.130
Like that's not great crowd.
You know,
diminishing or,

842
00:51:55.131 --> 00:51:58.630
or when someone is not a comic,
that kind of Shit.
They were like,

843
00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:00.860
I remember one time someone came up to me after a show and they're like,

844
00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:03.440
I could never do that.
I'm like,
what?

845
00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:07.010
Like it's just like a weird little like it doesn't seem,
yeah,

846
00:52:07.011 --> 00:52:09.800
I know you're saying it doesn't seem 100% pod.
I don't know how you do it.

847
00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:14.450
It'd be like you wouldn't understand.

848
00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:19.130
You want to find my best friend likes you.
That's always weird.

849
00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:23.300
Have my friend likes you or not the girlfriend clearly doesn't guys want to do

850
00:52:23.301 --> 00:52:26.120
that?
Guys always want to come up to me and be like,
Hey,
I don't know who you are,

851
00:52:26.121 --> 00:52:29.210
but we just take a picture of me for my girlfriend.
I'm like,
all right.

852
00:52:29.211 --> 00:52:33.320
I get the opposite.
I get,
I get the guy.
My favorite is when the guy goes,
dude,

853
00:52:33.321 --> 00:52:38.270
picture and I'm like,
okay,
and then he's like,
babe and she's like,
I'm good.
All

854
00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:44.600
guys at the airport.
I'm like,
come on man.
That's so funny.

855
00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:47.540
I get a lot of you guys probably get this because you have a,
like,

856
00:52:47.541 --> 00:52:50.780
you're so known by your fans.
Like I get a lot of people who are like,
Hey,

857
00:52:50.781 --> 00:52:54.290
my phone's charging.
Could you just take a picture and email it to me?
Oh my God.

858
00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:58.460
I'm like,
what is the five I'm giving off?
And then they're like,
how's your knee?

859
00:52:58.461 --> 00:53:01.670
I'm like,
what?
How do you know?
Born in a podcast?

860
00:53:01.671 --> 00:53:04.880
People just think you're friends for sure.
Absolutely.

861
00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:08.300
I kind of enjoy that though because I feel like they know what they're getting

862
00:53:08.301 --> 00:53:09.860
when they come to a show.

863
00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:13.340
Then the whole thing of them being like,

864
00:53:13.341 --> 00:53:15.830
what a lady saying crazy shit like yes bro.

865
00:53:15.831 --> 00:53:20.390
Like you're on board told or that you like the real downside though,

866
00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:27.010
being engaged is it takes so many opportunities off the table seeing that a lot

867
00:53:27.811 --> 00:53:28.860
of women,

868
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:33.430
<v 10>can you making these videos of why they like the bad boys there?</v>

869
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:38.260
You just don't sell yourself short.
It's yourself a man.

870
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:43.840
So actually professor the bad boy that'll possibly just steal your heart

871
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:47.240
<v 9>toy with it.
Hey,
you're looking at the good time.</v>

872
00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:50.540
That's more just be goofy.

873
00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:51.503
<v 10>Whichever</v>

874
00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:58.090
<v 9>that's sconce is not my favorite.
Are you into like posters?</v>

875
00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:05.890
That's not what that is.
I the MAC is that a row?

876
00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:08.800
It's comfortable just being himself.
There you that's true.
It's not,

877
00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:13.870
it's wait,
you already say stop looking so hard.
Stop looking at what is that?

878
00:54:13.871 --> 00:54:15.560
Is that a famous person?
No,

879
00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.850
there's all these like Weirdos on Instagram that I feel like I've gotten famous

880
00:54:18.851 --> 00:54:22.710
and I'm never not working so hard or easy to find.
Ah,

881
00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:27.610
those sunglasses.
Farmer's Tan.
Yes.
He ever from goggles or something.
I mean,

882
00:54:27.611 --> 00:54:30.790
you're just going to leave that out there.
I don't know what to do.
See,

883
00:54:30.791 --> 00:54:33.070
this is why I want to get engaged again.
Yeah.

884
00:54:33.071 --> 00:54:35.870
Like I want to get married tomorrow.
Videos like that,

885
00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:40.690
bad boys out there that are so hard to resist.
Think my base if that,
or we do.

886
00:54:40.691 --> 00:54:43.900
We say that,
I don't even know.
People are starting to your base and your brand.

887
00:54:43.901 --> 00:54:44.980
I'm like,
I don't know what that means,

888
00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:48.880
but like I don't think that the guys that my success has been from guys that

889
00:54:48.881 --> 00:54:52.270
think I'm going to date them after.
I don't think,
no,

890
00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:55.490
I wouldn't say that's what you're putting out there.
Oh No.
Looks,
people are like,

891
00:54:55.491 --> 00:54:57.550
are you worried that now you're engaged,
you're going to lose fans?
I'm like,

892
00:54:57.551 --> 00:55:02.230
I don't like people were like tolerating my comedy because they thought at the

893
00:55:02.231 --> 00:55:06.520
end we were going to date.
Like that's the,
I get like girls.
Yeah,
that's what you,

894
00:55:06.521 --> 00:55:10.630
I think like a garage,
you guys that really have that,
um,
worry before.

895
00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:12.340
I've talked to guys who are like,
oh no,
I know.

896
00:55:12.341 --> 00:55:14.500
I know tons of comics who like are in relationships,

897
00:55:14.501 --> 00:55:19.240
but don't put it on their Instagram and stuff like that.
But I,
uh,
I,
I think guys,

898
00:55:19.241 --> 00:55:21.740
I'm like,
I still think it's weird.
It's like they're not the,

899
00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:25.510
are they really going to your shows cause you're available?
I don't think so.

900
00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:29.650
You know,
I think that,
I think that actually,
this is obviously why did it,

901
00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:32.670
but I think it helps because sometimes I do make fun of guys and girls.

902
00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:37.030
It's like I don't hate men.
I'm not a man hater.
I love men.
I'm marrying one.

903
00:55:37.031 --> 00:55:39.880
I'm going to share a toilet with Wa.
Like I love men.

904
00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:42.940
I Make Fun of the idiots like that fucking guy.
But I think it's,

905
00:55:42.941 --> 00:55:46.750
it's good to remind people like,
I'm not this bitter spinster who's like,
oh,

906
00:55:46.751 --> 00:55:50.200
of course man,
you really want to make you squirm.
So we brought out,

907
00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:54.370
I'm one of our,
yeah,
this,
get uncomfortable.
Get uncomfortable.
Imagine,

908
00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:56.740
imagine you're not engaged,
right?

909
00:55:56.741 --> 00:56:01.410
Let's go back maybe a couple of years.
I,
you're single.
He's like a month.

910
00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:03.220
Let me,
let's say you're single,
you're single,

911
00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:07.120
you're single and you're out and you have a night out and you know you're,

912
00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:09.670
you're approachable.
You're personable person.
Yeah.

913
00:56:09.671 --> 00:56:12.980
Somebody comes up to you and they're like,
oh hey crowd.
Yeah.

914
00:56:14.410 --> 00:56:16.330
I mean I would've laughed anyway.

915
00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:20.800
Then you have a little chat with them and you're like,
oh blah,
blah blah.

916
00:56:20.830 --> 00:56:23.950
And then for whatever reason,
maybe you a couple of drinks,

917
00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:27.470
<v 0>you exchange information but you don't think much of it.
Okay.</v>

918
00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:28.900
And the next morning,

919
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:34.510
the next morning you wake up to this.

920
00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:39.790
Good morning,
Julia,
just me Gel.
Just wanted to say hi.

921
00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:43.600
Wish you a great day.
Tell you that me and you.
Yes.

922
00:56:43.601 --> 00:56:48.160
Did I am getting a look at you was probably one of the greatest moments in my

923
00:56:48.161 --> 00:56:53.110
life.
Get out of here
you are to me.

924
00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:56.470
I mean just,
you're gorgeous.
You're that fan off.

925
00:56:57.170 --> 00:57:00.760
So sitting in my mind when you said to me,

926
00:57:00.761 --> 00:57:05.170
you want to go back with your ex boyfriend,
please erase them from your memory.

927
00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:08.680
Don't ever go back in the past.
I know because I've been there.

928
00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:12.730
Have you and I understand when you know you're trying to find somebody and go on

929
00:57:12.731 --> 00:57:17.200
dates and not the compares to your racks,

930
00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:18.490
but there is that.

931
00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:23.190
<v 9>How many fans do you have?
Got a lot of failures.
Really Complain Shoe.
It is me,</v>

932
00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:28.750
me and you.
We have great ventilation in here.
Oh yeah.
Oh,
he brags about it.

933
00:57:28.751 --> 00:57:32.580
He brags because he actually built this whole house every time.
All the gods.

934
00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:36.860
Your opener,
right?
Coming at you from the House I built.
That's why.
That's,

935
00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:41.170
that's where you start marketing
and then I'm in.

936
00:57:41.171 --> 00:57:43.000
I'm like this mother fucking build a house.
Yes.

937
00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:45.450
My ex is looking pretty wide right now.
Yeah,
right.

938
00:57:45.451 --> 00:57:50.210
That's lead with your strengths.
What is this facial?
Never been loved before.
Oh,

939
00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:51.640
did we?
Just me.

940
00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:55.670
<v 0>I'll make you feel like a woman.
It may feel like what?
What does that even mean?</v>

941
00:57:55.760 --> 00:58:00.020
After you experienced me?
You won't even know who your ex boyfriend is.
Wow.

942
00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:04.260
<v 9>So you're going to give me a lobotomy with your Dick.
I will.
I will.
Yeah.</v>

943
00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:09.300
Julia,
it's sad tense.
Let's go get to the whole other level here.

944
00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:11.970
Open up your heart to me in your arms.

945
00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:16.150
Let's go full throttle.
Gotcha.

946
00:58:16.970 --> 00:58:20.670
Is this about fucking her love?
He's just,

947
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.320
he's obsessive boundaries.
Just a random guy.

948
00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:30.760
<v 0>This has got to be to me.</v>

949
00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:34.990
I mean what I feel when I watch it,
I love ritual by the way.

950
00:58:34.991 --> 00:58:38.410
It's not going to get me in trouble.
No,
no,
no,
not at all.
There's,
there's the,

951
00:58:38.411 --> 00:58:41.650
the level of embarrassment I feel for him because everyone has,

952
00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:44.970
has done something to a degree.
Yeah,
of course.

953
00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.440
You know where you send a text,

954
00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:50.620
but the fact that he went full throttle,

955
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:52.760
<v 9>no,
it's full throttle.
Full travel.
But who,</v>

956
00:58:52.790 --> 00:58:57.430
who did he say he sent you said this to eight 19 year old freshman in college

957
00:58:57.490 --> 00:59:01.960
and he's obviously not.
And uh,
and she blasted it.

958
00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:05.320
She said it to her friends and then it grew from there.
Yeah.
Julia,

959
00:59:05.730 --> 00:59:09.470
let's go full throttle.
Yeah.
How have you met guys like that went anywhere?

960
00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:13.420
They know what they're obsessed had that no.
I look at the sky and I'm like,

961
00:59:13.421 --> 00:59:16.720
if I had that kind of confidence and I would have everything I want in life.

962
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:20.140
Do you do that?
You have that kind of confidence?

963
00:59:20.141 --> 00:59:22.990
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You go full throttle all the time.

964
00:59:24.290 --> 00:59:28.340
Go full throttle.
And then my next special,
if you're going to shoot one,
two,

965
00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:33.260
are you excited?
Yes,
a little bit.
I'm a little bit like even touring,
right?
Yeah.

966
00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:36.750
I've been touring like I've been doing clubs just to run it over and theaters

967
00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:38.690
you.
I feel like there's this thing with comics now.

968
00:59:38.691 --> 00:59:41.050
Like where if you're not doing theaters,
like people think you're,

969
00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:42.320
you can't do them and you're like,

970
00:59:42.321 --> 00:59:44.690
well I don't want to do clubs cause everyone's gonna think I can't do theater

971
00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:47.780
and to get the reps it's so,
yeah,

972
00:59:47.781 --> 00:59:50.300
it's just like with social media now it's like everyone's like,

973
00:59:50.301 --> 00:59:53.030
I find myself doing it like comparing and all this kind of stuff and I'm like,

974
00:59:53.031 --> 00:59:54.740
I'm just going to do my thing.
I'm going to do clubs.

975
00:59:54.741 --> 00:59:58.550
Cause that's the only way I know how to get ready for a special
cause you can do,

976
00:59:58.551 --> 01:00:00.790
I'm like,
I want to change this and I can do it in an hour.

977
01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:04.040
Where are you shooting?
DC?
Yeah.
OK.

978
01:00:04.041 --> 01:00:08.180
I was just so the other day checking out theaters and um,
I uh,
I'm doing it.

979
01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:08.630
I just,

980
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:11.930
there's a little bit in my head now and I think this is new for comics where

981
01:00:11.931 --> 01:00:12.171
it's like,

982
01:00:12.171 --> 01:00:16.160
am I going to get fucking shit that someone going to think that's racist?

983
01:00:16.161 --> 01:00:19.010
People are gonna think that's sexist.
And I find myself like totally over.

984
01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:24.080
I gotta get Outta there.
I know I'm scared.
I just did a half hour.

985
01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:25.150
The degenerates.
Yeah.
Yeah.

986
01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:28.310
Cause I want to add topical material and the me too thing and I didn't want to

987
01:00:28.311 --> 01:00:31.990
wait to put it on an hour and a year from now and I'm like,
God,

988
01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:36.230
thank God I'm kind of protected by the degenerates.
Yeah,
that's right.

989
01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:39.530
This is going to protect you just this much.
That's what it's called.

990
01:00:39.531 --> 01:00:42.800
Shit you're going to say.
I agree with where I say like,

991
01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:45.470
you're slutty Indian costume is kind of that.
I'm just like,

992
01:00:45.471 --> 01:00:50.300
do I have to say native Americans?
Oh my God,
do I have to change that?

993
01:00:50.301 --> 01:00:55.301
It's just we're in this fucking walking on eggshells and it's like comps shit

994
01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:01.790
that you don't respond at all.
Never engage.
See,
that's so smart.

995
01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:03.620
Because I was like,
I have such a hard time,

996
01:01:03.621 --> 01:01:07.130
not not getting the last word or just being standing up for yourself,
you know,

997
01:01:07.131 --> 01:01:07.964
when you're getting attack.

998
01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:10.250
But if you feel like something's really misrepresented,
yeah.

999
01:01:10.251 --> 01:01:13.190
You're just like disengage the most.
Well,
because comics,

1000
01:01:13.191 --> 01:01:16.340
I think that the thing that sort of our engine is like,

1001
01:01:16.341 --> 01:01:19.220
we want to get to the truth.
Like we're obsessed with justice,
right?

1002
01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:21.470
So it's like the idea of someone saying somebody that's not true.

1003
01:01:21.471 --> 01:01:23.010
It's like I have such a hard time not being,

1004
01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:27.500
but handle it the way you imagine a really,
really,

1005
01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:32.360
really famous person would handle it.
They would not entertain,
have their wife.

1006
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:37.010
Uh,
I'm gonna have Jadah hand.
No,
I'm not dealing with this.

1007
01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:40.760
But I just,
it's tricky cause comics,
like we thrive on feedback.

1008
01:01:40.761 --> 01:01:42.440
That's how we get better.

1009
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:45.290
But then it's like that feedback I just have to ignore and it's just like kind

1010
01:01:45.291 --> 01:01:48.230
of a mind fuck.
So,
um,
so yeah.
And I have some of the me too stuff too,

1011
01:01:48.231 --> 01:01:52.040
but I'm like,
Ugh,
this is going to be too late,
like in this kind of a hard,

1012
01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:55.970
well I wanted to make fun of the particular people at the,
at the moment.

1013
01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:00.770
Even now I look at those jokes,
I got a few Louie jokes and I was like,
oh fuck.

1014
01:02:00.771 --> 01:02:04.490
Like he had gone out into the clubs and I wish I had been able to write about

1015
01:02:04.491 --> 01:02:07.970
what he's recently from Bull Shit.
You know what I'm saying?

1016
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.510
That's what you get to do this do to your jokes on your podcast or like the

1017
01:02:11.511 --> 01:02:14.470
things your thoughts,
you know,
cause there's so much to chime in on.

1018
01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:17.780
You can just do it now.
I know.
It's frustrating.
I kinda,
yeah,
well anyway,
um,

1019
01:02:17.781 --> 01:02:19.220
so that's exciting.
So when do you shoot the,

1020
01:02:19.221 --> 01:02:22.320
so I'm shooting it in like three months.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Cause it's also,

1021
01:02:22.321 --> 01:02:26.970
it's like it's the last three specials I did were con hours used to be 45

1022
01:02:26.971 --> 01:02:30.490
minutes.
Yes.
With commercials.
Now there's 60 minutes,
you know,
so,

1023
01:02:30.890 --> 01:02:35.420
<v 0>but I do think that the,
the best formula for,</v>

1024
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:36.840
for doing them yeah.

1025
01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:41.840
Is as close to on the shorter side of 60.
Yup.
As,

1026
01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:44.480
as you can be good.
You really feel like good point.

1027
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:48.440
A lot of them have fucked up with being and I fucked up.
I mean,

1028
01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:51.110
because you get kind of like,
well I'll just leave it all in,
you know,

1029
01:02:51.111 --> 01:02:52.080
and it's like 72

1030
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:53.500
<v 9>yeah.
And you're like,
uh,
no.</v>

1031
01:02:53.501 --> 01:02:56.350
Just save it for the tour and they get to do it on the next one,

1032
01:02:56.380 --> 01:03:00.450
make it 58 for smart.
That's really smart.
I think those are the best ones.

1033
01:03:00.451 --> 01:03:03.290
And all of our attention spans now are just be weightless.
Your grammar.

1034
01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.290
It's like a minute.
Oh,

1035
01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:08.590
do the reason they're even our 30 and 15 minutes specials now.
Yeah.

1036
01:03:08.830 --> 01:03:13.350
Because the data shows them,
yeah.
The bed arts.
Yes.
So I mean that's,

1037
01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:16.470
that's a people or stuff that I love.
I'm probably watching someone's,

1038
01:03:16.471 --> 01:03:20.110
our are on Netflix and I just don't have the time cause I got a kid screaming or

1039
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:23.690
I'm like,
yeah,
fuck I want to whine.
I can't.
Yeah,
I'll get to it.
Yeah.

1040
01:03:23.770 --> 01:03:25.750
So it's like,
I'm just trying to figure out how to,

1041
01:03:25.751 --> 01:03:28.000
it's just like you guys keep saying like,
I know how to do business.

1042
01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:30.160
It's like this business keeps changing every minute.

1043
01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:33.520
Like my last special I did HBO,
I probably should have done that.
Blacks,
you know,

1044
01:03:33.521 --> 01:03:37.290
but it was like Hbo,
like that's your dream as a comment.

1045
01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:40.450
And then I'm like now to get on Hbo you have to put in nine passwords.

1046
01:03:40.451 --> 01:03:43.270
Like you have to like,
you know,
it's like hieroglyphics.

1047
01:03:43.271 --> 01:03:46.530
Like it's just like a whole thing.
Like no one can even find it,
you know?
Yeah.
Be,

1048
01:03:46.610 --> 01:03:48.980
it was the mountain top.
I mean,
when we were growing up.
Yeah.

1049
01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:52.690
So it was like my dream to always have an HBO special and then Netflix was just

1050
01:03:52.691 --> 01:03:55.960
happening and I was like,
oh,
Netflix,
what's that?
Like the streaming thing,

1051
01:03:55.961 --> 01:03:59.650
like that males,
you DVD.
I'm like,
you idiot.

1052
01:04:00.090 --> 01:04:03.210
Judged or not feel like I'm always like behind on that

1053
01:04:03.310 --> 01:04:05.680
<v 0>guy.
By the way,
the Good Morning Julia Guy,</v>

1054
01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:09.390
it was such a hit with our audience.

1055
01:04:09.391 --> 01:04:14.070
May think that they have been recording themselves to God.

1056
01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:18.170
This is my favorite part of our show.
You want to know who your ex boyfriend is?

1057
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:22.150
All right,
so here is some,
this is Andre who made his own.

1058
01:04:22.450 --> 01:04:25.860
Good Morning Julia.
Perfect frame.
It's me,
Joe Posters.

1059
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:29.270
<v 10>Just want to say hi.
Wish you a great day.</v>

1060
01:04:30.070 --> 01:04:34.080
I'll tell you that a mean you yesterday and getting a look at you [inaudible]

1061
01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:39.260
circle today.
Moments in my life.
You were so beautiful.

1062
01:04:40.490 --> 01:04:44.840
You don't know how beautiful you are to me.
I'm here to me.

1063
01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.350
Everyone else doesn't jus and uh,

1064
01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:52.160
it's been sitting in my mind when you said to me,

1065
01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:57.760
you want to go back with your ex boyfriend threes erase them from your memory.

1066
01:04:59.030 --> 01:05:00.380
You'll never go back in the past.

1067
01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:06.130
I know because I've been there just to get them saying you're trying to find

1068
01:05:06.231 --> 01:05:10.970
somebody.
Can you go on dates?
Nothing compares to your ex,

1069
01:05:12.110 --> 01:05:15.080
but there is a [inaudible] and Julia,

1070
01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:17.440
I promise you it is me.

1071
01:05:18.550 --> 01:05:23.340
<v 9>I will love you.
Oh my God.
His voice never been loved before.
I will chair a shoe.</v>

1072
01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.830
I'll make them feel like a woman.
A real woman.
Why is that?

1073
01:05:26.831 --> 01:05:30.520
So as you're reading from me,
maybe that's your experienced me.

1074
01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:33.850
You won't ever know who your ex boyfriend is.

1075
01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:39.160
Still open up your heart to me in your arm to me.
Let's go full throttle.

1076
01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:47.080
Full throttle.
What does that mean?
I'm,

1077
01:05:47.081 --> 01:05:51.220
if I'm trying to think.
If you were having sex.
Yeah.
And he said to you,
dead

1078
01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:55.420
<v 0>serious.
I want to,
uh,
does that make you feel like a woman?</v>

1079
01:05:56.110 --> 01:05:59.200
What would you do?
Well that's the thing.
It's just what does that,

1080
01:05:59.201 --> 01:06:03.730
even though it's an antiquated POV,
it's a guy who's going like,

1081
01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:08.260
uh,
you know,
uh,
I'll make a lady feel like a lady cause he's,
he's fucking,

1082
01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:13.160
<v 9>it's like a chivalry.
Oh.
Oh,
I'm going to hold it.</v>

1083
01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:18.360
I thought it was sexual.
Like you're going to know I'm going to hold the going,

1084
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:20.950
lay my coat down on a puddle of water.

1085
01:06:20.951 --> 01:06:25.360
So you don't come in to laid down my leather bomber jacket from the 80s I like

1086
01:06:25.361 --> 01:06:29.050
that though.
I like chivalry.
That's why that timing.
But I feel like a woman.

1087
01:06:29.051 --> 01:06:31.410
Is it like I feel like I have cramps.
I,

1088
01:06:31.411 --> 01:06:33.640
that's what I feel like a woman every day.

1089
01:06:33.641 --> 01:06:35.440
I don't want to feel anymore like a woman.

1090
01:06:35.490 --> 01:06:37.930
That quick sample of what Scott did here,

1091
01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:41.193
the baby teeth

1092
01:06:41.830 --> 01:06:46.750
<v 11>say getting to meet you and spend time with you yesterday was one of the best</v>

1093
01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:51.090
days of my life.
I could really see myself falling in love with you with the,

1094
01:06:51.110 --> 01:06:53.170
with those pretty eyes,
your gorgeous.

1095
01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:55.920
And I built everything here in this house myself,

1096
01:06:55.930 --> 01:07:00.930
the cabinets in the crown molding trim on the cabinets.

1097
01:07:01.391 --> 01:07:05.410
And I just want to say,
ah,
you know,
you're beautiful and you should,

1098
01:07:05.490 --> 01:07:07.620
you should never go back with that other baby.
And uh,

1099
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:11.680
I hope this video doesn't scare you.
So I love you baby doll.

1100
01:07:11.681 --> 01:07:13.160
What does that town no more?

1101
01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:18.790
<v 0>Oh my God.
What would you do?
Why wouldn't you just send a text saying like,
Hey,</v>

1102
01:07:18.791 --> 01:07:22.240
love to see you again.
Probably.
He probably left there.

1103
01:07:22.290 --> 01:07:26.320
I kind of identify to a degree where like I remember,

1104
01:07:26.321 --> 01:07:31.060
you know that dude probably hasn't at his age,

1105
01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:35.290
hasn't taught,
probably even spoken to a young,
a young girl.

1106
01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:39.820
She loves videos.
She's young and he,
he,
she probably gave him a tension,
you know,

1107
01:07:39.821 --> 01:07:42.400
like in that conversation he was like this is it.

1108
01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:47.410
This is the girl he went into like a fantasy land of this is how I'm gonna

1109
01:07:47.411 --> 01:07:51.760
marry.
You know,
this is my lady right here.
Did you do that with her?
Absolutely.

1110
01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:55.750
Now and then
and then he went into,

1111
01:07:56.110 --> 01:08:00.100
he went into,
he laid out,
he saw the like he,

1112
01:08:00.130 --> 01:08:01.480
I'm going to send her this video,

1113
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:04.780
she's going to respond and like it's going to go off.

1114
01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:09.040
Cause he probably remembered moments when they were having a drink or sharing an

1115
01:08:09.070 --> 01:08:13.090
Uber or whatever the fuck they were doing that he was like this is special.

1116
01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:15.910
He started to tell himself that it was more significant.
Right.

1117
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:18.020
That's what it wants to,
yeah,
you're right.

1118
01:08:18.270 --> 01:08:20.380
You're just waiting for teenage girls do teenagers.

1119
01:08:20.690 --> 01:08:22.670
He fills your old girls to be clear.

1120
01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:27.560
He feels this way for every girl that gives him attention.
That's the problem.

1121
01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:30.590
There's a meal on it in any way,
Julius.

1122
01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:35.780
I think the thing I did it because our friend of someone who wrote in to the

1123
01:08:35.781 --> 01:08:40.010
show knows the girl that he sent it to her to get her on.

1124
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.920
We got to get them on.

1125
01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:45.400
She was a university of fucking Iowa fresh,

1126
01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:49.860
you're going to say University of Phoenix.
Uh,
university of items,
real play.

1127
01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:53.510
And she,
um,
you know,
just probably was,

1128
01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:58.010
had a couple drinks and was just talking to a guy and he just took it to,

1129
01:08:58.190 --> 01:08:59.690
this is my soul mate,
you know?

1130
01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.590
<v 12>No,
it was heartbreaking.</v>

1131
01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:08.980
I woke up so excited.
Ah,
I don't know if you noticed about,

1132
01:09:08.981 --> 01:09:10.930
I changed the locks on your door.

1133
01:09:11.810 --> 01:09:15.700
Now I can come in and fix you up your water heater.

1134
01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:19.350
I can fix his septic.
I can wait.

1135
01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:22.330
I'll put him beautiful marble.

1136
01:09:25.450 --> 01:09:29.110
Love you like no one's shit,
man.
Me.

1137
01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:34.900
You know what I'm saying?
Let's go for travel fucking thing.
You May,

1138
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:38.060
cy made a curse,
but fuck,
I wanna fuck you.
Pretty bad.

1139
01:09:39.230 --> 01:09:41.830
<v 0>I had a guy,
when I first talked to Chris,</v>

1140
01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:47.550
this was an older guy who sat me down and pitched himself to me and he's like,

1141
01:09:49.241 --> 01:09:51.840
I can make pasta.
This is what I want to do.

1142
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:55.600
Like it was like giving me like his skills.
Like it was literally like,

1143
01:09:55.601 --> 01:09:57.330
I have a car,
I have my own house.
They know.

1144
01:09:57.331 --> 01:10:00.520
It was just sort of this thing of like I date like drug addict,

1145
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:03.220
homeless drug addict.
Like none of this is,
you know,

1146
01:10:03.221 --> 01:10:05.540
like it was the point in my life where I was dating monsters,
you know?
Yeah.

1147
01:10:05.541 --> 01:10:07.240
It was just sort of this like,
oh,

1148
01:10:07.241 --> 01:10:10.690
like I guess if you're a guy you just have to pitch your skill.

1149
01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:11.800
Well I think every,

1150
01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:17.240
I think every guy knows what's going on with that guy because you see,

1151
01:10:17.771 --> 01:10:22.771
you know the element of your brain that might lead you to do something like

1152
01:10:22.931 --> 01:10:27.570
that.
But 95% of us would raise,

1153
01:10:27.610 --> 01:10:31.350
like you might have a thought.
I met that girl.
I want to send her a bit like,

1154
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:35.980
and you're like,
what are you out of your fucking mind?
No.
So yeah.

1155
01:10:35.981 --> 01:10:39.040
Then you send a text or you know,
you play out.

1156
01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:42.970
What's the way to approach this?
That guy just doesn't have,

1157
01:10:42.971 --> 01:10:46.630
he doesn't have the ability to stop a bad,

1158
01:10:46.631 --> 01:10:51.040
I can't exactly an aspergers thing where they don't read the room and he's just

1159
01:10:51.041 --> 01:10:56.041
going to do what he wants to do and worked with a guy one time who he was really

1160
01:10:56.501 --> 01:10:59.980
nice and I could tell something was off like something was definitely off.

1161
01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:04.660
And he brought up Jessica Biel one time and he was like,
I love her.

1162
01:11:05.130 --> 01:11:09.490
Like I love her so much.
And I was like,
okay.
And he's like,
yeah,
I got like,

1163
01:11:10.090 --> 01:11:13.980
I got pictures over all over my room and I was,
why?
He's

1164
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:18.750
<v 9>like,
I'm going to be with her.
He was probably like late twenties.</v>

1165
01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:20.213
Um,

1166
01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:23.970
there was a moment where people were using the secret is a way to justify being

1167
01:11:23.971 --> 01:11:25.430
stockers.
Maybe you're right.

1168
01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:28.220
Like I have photos of this person ever because I'm trying to manifest them.

1169
01:11:28.230 --> 01:11:31.620
This guy was a real,
yeah,
this guy was a real gentle,

1170
01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:34.710
if she dies and you're going to jail,
he should find it.

1171
01:11:34.711 --> 01:11:37.680
Your Vision Board game and stocker board,

1172
01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:42.210
female celebrities on your wall,
late twenties guy.

1173
01:11:42.211 --> 01:11:44.730
And he was like,
you know,
he would go to the,
I remember he was like,

1174
01:11:44.731 --> 01:11:48.990
I go to the beach,
I serve and like I just think about Jessica Biel all day.

1175
01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:52.580
I was like,
no,
no go.
You really think you're going to end up with her.

1176
01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:53.610
He was like,
I really do.

1177
01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:57.570
And then I would obviously like ask about it all the time.
I was like,

1178
01:11:57.890 --> 01:12:00.850
how's Jessica?
He's like,
yeah,
you know I,

1179
01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:04.850
I put up some new pictures of her this weekend and I was like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1180
01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:07.040
Yeah.
He was really,
really obsessed with,

1181
01:12:07.041 --> 01:12:10.800
which is so funny cause these days you'd have to print them.
I mean it's like,

1182
01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:12.780
it's not that you don't even tear them out of magazines.

1183
01:12:12.850 --> 01:12:15.590
Like we could at least tear them out of until now.

1184
01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:19.920
You have to like print paramount.
Yeah,
it's super creepy really.

1185
01:12:20.010 --> 01:12:21.690
And here's the thing we were working in,

1186
01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:25.590
we were working as site reps for productions.

1187
01:12:25.890 --> 01:12:30.600
So we would go to a,
he's waiting to be on a movie with her probably.

1188
01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:32.790
I mean like we would have huge,
I mean I did,

1189
01:12:32.791 --> 01:12:36.720
I did one of the site reps jobs with Beyonce.
So I mean any,
you know,

1190
01:12:36.721 --> 01:12:40.150
she could have been at any of these things.
And yeah,
he was really,

1191
01:12:41.410 --> 01:12:46.350
you just really made me realize something in myself that I'm deeply ashamed of,

1192
01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:49.650
which is I think that like,
cause when you're these thoughts,

1193
01:12:49.651 --> 01:12:51.090
whatever you're about to say,
I love,

1194
01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:54.090
well I have the worst one at the proposal that I feel like all know you guys

1195
01:12:54.091 --> 01:12:56.000
aren't going to understand that.
I feel like I have to ask you about.

1196
01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:59.820
But like when I,
there is this part of your brain,
I think for me,

1197
01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:03.660
where I always think I'm in the running.
Like when I saw,

1198
01:13:03.690 --> 01:13:06.240
I don't know anything about the royal family,
I don't really follow that stuff.

1199
01:13:06.241 --> 01:13:09.180
But I saw that Meghan Markle wasn't,
I didn't really know who she,

1200
01:13:09.181 --> 01:13:12.300
I didn't really know who he like and I was like,
fucking bitch.

1201
01:13:13.210 --> 01:13:16.180
I thought in my head I was like,
she took and I'm like,

1202
01:13:16.210 --> 01:13:20.180
I wasn't in the running for that.
Oh
man,

1203
01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:23.540
there's this little thing in your head that's just the craziest shit waiting.

1204
01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:30.100
I'm all,
wait a minute.
Oh,
I've never done that.
I was on board and I was like,

1205
01:13:30.101 --> 01:13:32.830
yeah,
but it's like,
you know how you're just kinda like,

1206
01:13:32.831 --> 01:13:36.150
whenever a male celebrity gets married,
a little part of me is like that,

1207
01:13:36.151 --> 01:13:37.000
but that could have been me.

1208
01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:42.250
I wasn't in the running leg was Disney movies.

1209
01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:47.080
Like something got in my head that that was your man that made me like compete.

1210
01:13:47.081 --> 01:13:49.810
Who was your man?
Wait,
who did you,
who are you bummed out that got married?

1211
01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:54.640
Prince.
Prince.
Is it
the new one?

1212
01:13:54.641 --> 01:13:55.910
I ginger walk.

1213
01:13:55.940 --> 01:13:58.510
I saw all these photos of them when I first saw it and they were like,

1214
01:13:58.511 --> 01:14:00.820
they're engaged.
And I was like,
ah,
fuck it.
I know.

1215
01:14:00.821 --> 01:14:03.700
Like she took that horrible Gig to be,

1216
01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:07.230
I would never want to have right Johnny hose all day.

1217
01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:11.530
You're not allowed to wear eat Sushi chefs in nightmare you can't eat is that

1218
01:14:11.570 --> 01:14:13.300
you can't eat Sushi.
You can't have dark nail Polish,

1219
01:14:13.301 --> 01:14:16.810
which of course were wearing the exact,
I know like,
wait,
why can't you eat Sushi?

1220
01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:19.930
Because something about mercury or like point like fish poisoning because their

1221
01:14:20.170 --> 01:14:23.260
people are probably always trying to poison them or something.
I Dunno.
Interest.

1222
01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:26.530
I saw some article that was like,
what Meghan Markle can't do anymore.
Really?

1223
01:14:26.531 --> 01:14:30.970
What else?
Tell me the panty hose.
She's not allowed to wear dark nail Polish.

1224
01:14:30.971 --> 01:14:33.850
She's not allowed to eat fish or maybe it's just the queen doesn't like

1225
01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:37.630
something.
She's not let Deborah and cell phone.
She's not let him social media.

1226
01:14:37.631 --> 01:14:40.900
I was like,
I can never do this.
She can have her own phone.
I don't think so.

1227
01:14:40.930 --> 01:14:45.010
Well that's like a security I guess,
which that kind of makes sense.
They had to,

1228
01:14:45.970 --> 01:14:46.803
I don't understand it

1229
01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:51.070
because so many people came out of there.

1230
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:56.050
She was abroad somewhere in Asia and people just came out of their homes and

1231
01:14:56.051 --> 01:14:59.770
businesses and swarmed this area.
So they had to like what a nightmare.

1232
01:14:59.890 --> 01:15:03.100
That's a nightmare that happened at my dad's funeral.
I mean,
not like that.

1233
01:15:03.101 --> 01:15:03.880
I'm not,

1234
01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:06.490
I was at my dad's funeral and I guess some people had known my dad was going to

1235
01:15:06.491 --> 01:15:09.640
die,
like a couple people showed up to take pictures and I did it of course.

1236
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:12.040
But it was just,
I wasn't like,

1237
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:14.560
it was actually kind of Nice cause it was a little bit of a distraction.

1238
01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:18.780
That was like,
great,
let's like take off your dad's funeral national filter.
Um,

1239
01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:21.880
yeah.
Like it's just like,
it was like on Facebook or something and you're like,

1240
01:15:21.881 --> 01:15:25.420
people like,
what are you dangling?
So that's gross.
And it's like I'm not like a,

1241
01:15:25.421 --> 01:15:29.620
yeah,
like a year and a half ago.
But when,
oh,
but when he proposed,

1242
01:15:29.621 --> 01:15:33.460
what was your first thought?
Uh,
okay.
So he,
yeah,
he,
he goes,

1243
01:15:33.461 --> 01:15:36.220
come over here and I go,
I don't want to smell your fart.

1244
01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:39.900
That was my first thought because he always used to fart and then pull me into

1245
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:44.320
the park.
You still do.
So I thought you were tricking me.
Fart cloud.

1246
01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:47.540
I thought he was tricking me.
So when he first did it,

1247
01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:52.330
the way he was clear,
he tricked me.
No,
I like,
you know,

1248
01:15:52.331 --> 01:15:55.600
you go like,
oh my God,
are you serious?
Like do you mean it?
Like you're like,

1249
01:15:55.630 --> 01:15:56.920
oh wow,
that's great.
Wait,
wait.

1250
01:15:56.921 --> 01:16:00.690
But he just did it like where was it in our apartment and our apartment at a

1251
01:16:00.691 --> 01:16:04.570
just out of nowhere I,
but we're coming back from Irvine.
We had done a show.

1252
01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:09.420
And what made you choose?
So I bought like,

1253
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:12.390
I know he gets dragged through the ringer on this.

1254
01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:17.200
Oh that I'm all about the ring.
I was going to do it,
let's say in September.
Yeah,

1255
01:16:17.201 --> 01:16:19.780
I was gonna do it.
New Year's we're going to do with this vacation.
The keys.

1256
01:16:19.781 --> 01:16:23.230
I was like,
that's perfect.
I know it was burning a hole in my pocket.

1257
01:16:23.470 --> 01:16:27.310
I was thinking about it all the time.
So I,
my dude was like,

1258
01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:30.910
having getting proposing is actually cool because you feel like an action hero

1259
01:16:30.911 --> 01:16:33.300
all the time because you're always like trying to hide a diamond.

1260
01:16:33.301 --> 01:16:37.120
You're like a jewel.
That's funny.
He,
and when I asked him,
I was like,

1261
01:16:37.121 --> 01:16:40.370
well where did you have at the whole time it's like totally like ruin the
moment.

1262
01:16:40.371 --> 01:16:40.991
Cause he was like,
oh,

1263
01:16:40.991 --> 01:16:43.360
I just kept it in the washing machine because I knew you'd never look there.

1264
01:16:44.090 --> 01:16:45.810
It's like,
that's really fun.

1265
01:16:46.170 --> 01:16:50.630
So he just hit it like we're cleaning supplies are hilarious.
So you just,

1266
01:16:50.730 --> 01:16:52.520
you just had it on your person?
I would like,

1267
01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.270
I would look for it all the time and like

1268
01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:58.810
dress and I took it to like the show because I was like,

1269
01:16:58.811 --> 01:17:01.120
I didn't want to leave it and then you have just let it fly with it because

1270
01:17:01.121 --> 01:17:03.820
we've had to fly to the keys with it.
And I was always,
I was like,

1271
01:17:03.821 --> 01:17:07.770
there's no way I'll be able to hold on another six,

1272
01:17:07.810 --> 01:17:09.960
eight weeks to do this.
No.

1273
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:14.840
<v 0>Is it where I was like,
I just,
you know,
I'm going to do it right now.
I didn't,</v>

1274
01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:17.690
that wasn't a plan.
It was obviously like just,
you know,

1275
01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:21.320
I did pretty well tonight.
I feel like it was October 8th we got engaged.

1276
01:17:21.730 --> 01:17:26.690
It was November,
November 7th,
seventh we got married November.

1277
01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:31.100
Right.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Yeah,
it's been a,
wow,
look what he's got.

1278
01:17:31.130 --> 01:17:35.960
Wonderful,
beautiful,
radiant teeth.
Let's talk about that.
Hold on.

1279
01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:39.910
We always are fascinated by teeth and,

1280
01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:44.180
<v 9>oh my God,
I have big t perfect,
gorgeous.</v>

1281
01:17:44.230 --> 01:17:49.090
Let's about all kinds of braces and everything.
I had clear braces.

1282
01:17:49.091 --> 01:17:52.390
I begged my uncle or whoever was paying for my braces.

1283
01:17:52.570 --> 01:17:54.850
So ask me how my childhood and a whatever,

1284
01:17:54.851 --> 01:17:58.210
like stranger that was donating to the Kickstarter,

1285
01:17:58.211 --> 01:18:00.010
that was my teeth as a kid,

1286
01:18:00.011 --> 01:18:04.710
I want to clear braces because I did remember the clearer it must've been.
Wait,

1287
01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:07.390
no,
when we were kids it was way more expensive.

1288
01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:10.500
They were way more expensive and they didn't work.
Oh yeah.

1289
01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:13.210
They were way more intense and they're actually,
cause they,
they were,

1290
01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:15.640
you had to adjust them too much was I don't remember what it was,

1291
01:18:15.641 --> 01:18:18.220
but they were less,
oh they said you have to wear them twice as long.

1292
01:18:18.221 --> 01:18:20.210
And I was like,
fine.
You know,
I just like,

1293
01:18:20.211 --> 01:18:23.820
because my last name was Cummings and I already got bullied and I,
yeah,

1294
01:18:23.890 --> 01:18:28.330
I was just like,
I can't add any more jokes to my face.
So I was already cum,

1295
01:18:28.331 --> 01:18:31.240
shot and cum in your mouth.
I'm like at seven,
you know,

1296
01:18:31.241 --> 01:18:35.140
before I even knew what it was like.
And uh,
so I was like,
I need to clear races.

1297
01:18:35.170 --> 01:18:39.130
It takes twice as long and they turn whatever color food you're eating.

1298
01:18:39.131 --> 01:18:43.450
So there's no such thing as clear braces,
yell,
they're disgusting.

1299
01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:47.140
They just collect food from what I remember,
rose.
So they didn't really take,

1300
01:18:47.141 --> 01:18:50.860
and I pulled them off.
I remember one night cause I was like so embarrassed.

1301
01:18:51.070 --> 01:18:55.000
And then now I do the Invisalign thing.
Oh,
so you don't do it now I have it.
Yeah.

1302
01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:58.620
I'm not wearing it right now,
but I do it like a radically,
I always lose teeth.

1303
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:04.340
They're really sensitive teeth,
like zoom and stuff.

1304
01:19:05.050 --> 01:19:08.830
I do.
No,
I don't do the whitening,
but I can't drink cold water.

1305
01:19:08.831 --> 01:19:11.530
I can't have ice so I have to use like some special toothpaste.

1306
01:19:11.531 --> 01:19:15.490
It's really Sensodyne barrow to saying yes,
they're a sponsor.
Yes.

1307
01:19:16.090 --> 01:19:16.900
If not,

1308
01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:18.600
<v 0>do you do you wait a minute though.</v>

1309
01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:22.020
I bet you you do a lot of

1310
01:19:22.530 --> 01:19:27.330
<v 9>care though,
right?
You know what?
I try.
I try.</v>

1311
01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:32.400
You got to come across as having impeccable dental hygiene.
Yes,
we,

1312
01:19:32.530 --> 01:19:34.080
it's been legal.
It I'm slipping.

1313
01:19:34.710 --> 01:19:37.890
I started getting this because I used to take Lunesta and all that shit and now

1314
01:19:37.891 --> 01:19:40.770
I just do like the vape before I go to bed and I wake up like fully clothed and

1315
01:19:40.771 --> 01:19:41.604
I'm like,
God damn man.

1316
01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:44.400
So it's like all my night hygiene has been kind of slipping,

1317
01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:47.730
but I try to do the little flosser things.
Refresh it.

1318
01:19:47.731 --> 01:19:51.390
You do whitening strips like the crest ones or do you do with dental whitening

1319
01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:55.490
professional?
I haven't done whitening.
Your teeth are very right.

1320
01:19:56.430 --> 01:20:00.390
I do it.
I have white professional whitening.
I go every few years.

1321
01:20:00.391 --> 01:20:05.130
I have a freshman,
Freshman,
oh shit.
I know you done the granny yellow.

1322
01:20:05.131 --> 01:20:07.170
They're getting a little Janky.
Very lucky.
Thank you.
The,

1323
01:20:07.171 --> 01:20:09.630
and they do what they do is they,
uh,
when Invisalign,

1324
01:20:09.631 --> 01:20:12.300
they have to file them to get more space in between them.

1325
01:20:12.301 --> 01:20:14.850
So when you don't use Invisalign,
then you just have like weird holes.

1326
01:20:14.851 --> 01:20:18.090
So I'm just like,
I need to be better about the Invisalign.
I just lose it.

1327
01:20:18.091 --> 01:20:22.050
Like we travel so much.
I lose my tray.
Oh my God.
I know what I wanted to ask you.

1328
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:26.630
I follow you on Instagram and I've noticed that you're very,
uh,

1329
01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:29.340
into your skincare regimen regime.

1330
01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:34.100
Is that the word regimen or regime?
This regime regime is like you,

1331
01:20:34.410 --> 01:20:37.410
you're a leader for regime.

1332
01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:41.460
But I might have a skincare regime at some point if comedy doesn't work out.
No,

1333
01:20:41.461 --> 01:20:45.540
but you're very disciplined and you do what you're supposed to do.

1334
01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:49.500
Have you read my comments?
Now?
I'm in a constant state of fear of aging,

1335
01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:52.620
so I'm just constantly just putting shit.
Oh,
is that,
yeah.

1336
01:20:52.621 --> 01:20:55.800
I don't have television came in and really fucked things up.
I mean,

1337
01:20:55.801 --> 01:20:58.980
I'd have television picks up more than the human eye picks up.

1338
01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:02.900
I remember one time I was shooting a show,
we had an actress,
the most beautiful,

1339
01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:07.350
gorgeous,
stunning Irish,
um,
really pale skin.

1340
01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:09.870
Just stunning.
Gets in hair and makeup,
goes on camera.

1341
01:21:09.871 --> 01:21:14.060
All of a sudden her face is covered and freckles.
Oh,
the camera.
Yeah.

1342
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:17.970
It was just like the human eye can't pick it up and she just had little freckles

1343
01:21:17.971 --> 01:21:21.390
everywhere and it was,
you know,
and like,
I don't think she even knew it.

1344
01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:24.240
It's a magnifying glass.
So we had to fix it in post production,

1345
01:21:24.241 --> 01:21:28.980
so she never saw it.
She reminds me to,
uh,
she's like,
do you ever wash your face?

1346
01:21:29.010 --> 01:21:31.950
And I'm like,
oh,
she's never,
I have this whole thing with my guy right now.
We'll,

1347
01:21:31.951 --> 01:21:35.640
beards are a whole thing too.
Yes.
Smells that he got.
It's like they get the,

1348
01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:39.050
they to smell.
It's always like chowder.
It's so gross.
Yeah.

1349
01:21:39.210 --> 01:21:42.360
They get the follicles get all clogged and you have to get in there and wash

1350
01:21:42.361 --> 01:21:45.900
them.
But he got a little thing that like cleans it.
It's like a prescription.

1351
01:21:45.930 --> 01:21:46.530
Yeah.

1352
01:21:46.530 --> 01:21:49.890
But you got to wash your face and on the road is just like tricky cause you're

1353
01:21:49.891 --> 01:21:52.600
with all the shitty water in different cities.
So do you,

1354
01:21:52.630 --> 01:21:55.510
do you take your whole skin care thing?
Like on the,
cause I know you have a go,

1355
01:21:55.550 --> 01:21:59.870
you do the roller.
I just do it on Instagram.
I feel like when people,

1356
01:21:59.871 --> 01:22:02.030
when you do something on Instagram,
people will assume you do it constantly.

1357
01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:05.180
Like oh I thought you could pretty much only do it when I'm filming,
you know?

1358
01:22:05.190 --> 01:22:08.970
Okay.
Cause I'm like damn,
she's so disciplined.
Like no,
I don't do it every night.

1359
01:22:08.971 --> 01:22:10.890
But I tried to do that look cause I don't like look,

1360
01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.860
look at all the famous female comics,
have any,

1361
01:22:13.861 --> 01:22:18.270
not gotten crazy work and they kind of have to at some point I'm worried.

1362
01:22:18.271 --> 01:22:21.210
Even Richard,
Jenny was starting to do like I'm concerned about,

1363
01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:23.110
<v 0>what's his name?
Uh,
Yup.</v>

1364
01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:26.680
<v 9>I know who you're thinking.
I know we're talking about yes.
Has It 16 year old</v>

1365
01:22:26.710 --> 01:22:31.170
<v 0>girlfriend?
No,
no,
I was thinking of a Vegas.
No,</v>

1366
01:22:31.210 --> 01:22:34.900
I was thinking of actually who passed away.
Um,
oh,

1367
01:22:34.901 --> 01:22:37.690
you weren't even thinking of it.
And I was thinking of Guy,
uh,
Shandling.

1368
01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:41.320
<v 9>Yeah.
Ooh,
yeah.
So it's like what,
what did,
I don't know what that is.</v>

1369
01:22:41.321 --> 01:22:44.500
Maybe the same thing that makes us comics and want to go make strangers laugh is

1370
01:22:44.501 --> 01:22:46.410
the same thing that makes us dysmorphic or

1371
01:22:47.570 --> 01:22:49.880
<v 0>uh,
aging and,
and like people,
I could,</v>

1372
01:22:49.881 --> 01:22:52.690
people all the time hit me up in there like,

1373
01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:56.350
<v 9>but you can have a beard.
We can't,
but I get there like,</v>

1374
01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:58.390
<v 0>um,
you know,
you look,
you look</v>

1375
01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:01.720
<v 9>like someone's creepy uncle.
You Shave your head,
your,
you know,
your head,</v>

1376
01:23:01.730 --> 01:23:05.380
the ball.
I say something about that that's maybe helpful.
Not,

1377
01:23:05.381 --> 01:23:09.600
I think with comics people try to be funny and it's,
it's like,

1378
01:23:09.630 --> 01:23:11.950
it's not an insult.
They would say if you weren't a comic,

1379
01:23:11.951 --> 01:23:14.710
they're just kind of trying to like forge a bond with you.
Like I,

1380
01:23:14.730 --> 01:23:18.310
people come up to me in airports all the time and they say,
should,
that's so me.

1381
01:23:19.190 --> 01:23:20.920
And I think it's just like,
oh,
you were on the roast,

1382
01:23:20.930 --> 01:23:23.380
like Rosewood a clot in your lungs,
right?

1383
01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:29.710
People call you kind of more all the time,
all the time.

1384
01:23:29.711 --> 01:23:32.920
You know what I mean?
So I'm just like,
what is happening?
Um,
so yeah,

1385
01:23:32.921 --> 01:23:36.470
so I think it's just like,
I just want to get ahead of it.
Don't come.

1386
01:23:36.850 --> 01:23:40.890
I just want to get ahead of it cause I don't want to like go into that warm
hole.

1387
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:46.800
Unless you're 20 years old,
you're always going to look old.
It's like,
dude,

1388
01:23:46.801 --> 01:23:51.460
I'm not like,
I'm not trying to fool.
Nobody look great.
You look,

1389
01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:54.370
you guys took long enough for you to say you're like amazing.
Like amazing.

1390
01:23:54.371 --> 01:23:55.204
And you guys,

1391
01:23:56.390 --> 01:24:00.250
you guys look great and age appropriate.
It will be,

1392
01:24:01.450 --> 01:24:03.670
I don't want to look younger.
I just want to look the age I am.

1393
01:24:03.671 --> 01:24:08.080
But I think that what we do is so aging.
Like we're out to one in the morning.

1394
01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:11.650
We worked during the day also cause it's like comedy used to be you just to

1395
01:24:11.651 --> 01:24:13.480
stand up at night.
Now it's during the day,
you're doing a podcast,

1396
01:24:13.481 --> 01:24:14.314
you're writing stuff.

1397
01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:17.740
So we have full time jobs and then we go out til two in the morning and then

1398
01:24:17.741 --> 01:24:22.600
we're on flights.
I'm just,
I've been dehydrated since 2004 I am just like,

1399
01:24:22.930 --> 01:24:26.200
so I just think the stress of what we do is I just try to get ahead of it and

1400
01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:31.300
ours term shame,
a lot of inappropriate behavior in public love it.

1401
01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.193
I love that.

1402
01:24:33.190 --> 01:24:38.190
I can not believe came in though because people send us videos of people like

1403
01:24:39.311 --> 01:24:42.910
clipping their toenails on planes.
I've seen it at the gate.

1404
01:24:42.970 --> 01:24:46.090
I saw this motherfucker,
I've got on a plane recently.
You know,

1405
01:24:46.091 --> 01:24:48.640
it's like we've all worked really hard to be able to fly first class.

1406
01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:49.481
Like we worked.

1407
01:24:49.481 --> 01:24:52.740
I mean I remember days where I was doing 80 cities a year sitting in the back

1408
01:24:52.741 --> 01:24:57.340
row in the middle by the shitter.
Like we've done Sam flights.
So yes.

1409
01:24:57.341 --> 01:25:00.700
So yes.
So when I like to take a photo on Instagram,
so it's a go first class.

1410
01:25:00.701 --> 01:25:01.990
Like I'm just like,
fuck you dude.
First of all,

1411
01:25:01.991 --> 01:25:05.710
this is miles because we travel so much and like I've worked my ass and the

1412
01:25:05.711 --> 01:25:07.300
venue pays for like don't do this.

1413
01:25:08.050 --> 01:25:13.050
This fish gets on the plane with a bag of hard boiled eggs and I've seen that

1414
01:25:13.151 --> 01:25:17.650
before too.
I just went,
no,
it was like get to the back.
I full on,

1415
01:25:17.651 --> 01:25:19.750
had to have a conversation.
First Class.
Yes.

1416
01:25:19.751 --> 01:25:23.170
Sitting right next to me and I was going to Fort Lauderdale I think and I was

1417
01:25:23.171 --> 01:25:25.900
like,
I literally said,
I said to this woman,
yeah,

1418
01:25:25.901 --> 01:25:29.020
by poor palm beach bar or something and I was just like,
I've worked too hard.

1419
01:25:31.930 --> 01:25:34.840
I've worked too hard.
I've seen it.
I've seen somebody with a bag,

1420
01:25:34.841 --> 01:25:37.870
the Ziploc gallon bag and then crack pulling them.

1421
01:25:38.290 --> 01:25:43.270
Five of them smell.
No,
it's just,

1422
01:25:43.271 --> 01:25:46.960
it's so fucking rude.
This is going to blow your mind.

1423
01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:50.080
Julia.
Julia.

1424
01:25:57.190 --> 01:26:01.630
No,
no.
For our audiences listening,
know what?

1425
01:26:01.631 --> 01:26:04.040
No way to describe.
This is man who appears

1426
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:07.670
<v 0>to be in a grocery store.
I,
he is in a grocery store.</v>

1427
01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:12.880
He's at the hot food counter and he's using the ladle to serve soup.

1428
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:15.260
He is

1429
01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:16.460
<v 9>drinking from it?
No.</v>

1430
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:20.330
And he looks like he looks like a well put together guys.

1431
01:26:21.050 --> 01:26:24.790
That's he looks like.
So those are fancy shoes.
Yeah.

1432
01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:29.420
And he's got like a nice sweater bag of buns.
Bread.
What is that?

1433
01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:33.800
He's shopping.
It looks like Amy,
by the way,

1434
01:26:33.801 --> 01:26:35.950
if no one was in a grocery store,
would we all do that?

1435
01:26:36.110 --> 01:26:38.750
He's just doing what we all wish we could tell.
I mean,

1436
01:26:38.751 --> 01:26:42.790
I wish I could think in the grocery store straight up.
I agree.

1437
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:44.390
But you buy them,
right?

1438
01:26:44.391 --> 01:26:47.170
Like you put them in your separate container and eat them out of your bag.

1439
01:26:47.171 --> 01:26:50.150
You're right.
And then I,
yeah,
that's fine.
You're going to pay for those.
But this,

1440
01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:53.550
that's a public school.
That's insane.
That is bad.
Is it mental element.

1441
01:26:53.551 --> 01:26:54.430
And when I started doing,

1442
01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:58.190
when I got pregnant the second time I used to eat at Gelson's at the salad bar.

1443
01:26:58.190 --> 01:27:00.380
Yeah,
me too.
And then when I got Prager's I was like,
you know what?

1444
01:27:00.381 --> 01:27:03.980
This is a bacteria thing.
It is not safe.
Well,
did you see the um,
wild,

1445
01:27:03.981 --> 01:27:07.840
wild country?
That's how they poisoned everybody is they just put,
um,

1446
01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:12.440
a salmonella in the salad bars.
Yeah.
And He,
and I intuitively was like,

1447
01:27:12.441 --> 01:27:15.240
this will hurt my child.
So I stopped not safe.

1448
01:27:15.290 --> 01:27:18.650
And I love the guys [inaudible] cancer.
And when he was going through chemo,

1449
01:27:18.651 --> 01:27:22.160
they were like,
no salad bars.
Your immune system is not capable.
Wow.
Yeah.

1450
01:27:22.161 --> 01:27:23.210
And I love at the end of salad bars,

1451
01:27:23.211 --> 01:27:26.480
there's always like chocolate pudding or like,
I'll do it.
All right.

1452
01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:32.370
<v 0>We've been really obsessed with Garth Brooks and his um,
social media random.</v>

1453
01:27:32.371 --> 01:27:36.720
Is it great?
It's so amazing cause stuff,
slick stuff,

1454
01:27:36.721 --> 01:27:39.220
neat stuff.
That's him.
But uh,

1455
01:27:39.230 --> 01:27:42.300
I just came to our attention because we've been so obsessed with his videos that

1456
01:27:42.301 --> 01:27:47.301
another man who's looking to take the title of most Awkward Social Media Guy.

1457
01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:52.230
Yeah.
It is the founder and CEO of Facebook,
Mark Zuckerberg.

1458
01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:53.253
Really?

1459
01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:55.770
<v 13>Oh,
you guys are eating brisket and ribs tonight.</v>

1460
01:27:56.170 --> 01:28:00.620
Brisket and ribs.
They tastes doubly better when I'm,

1461
01:28:00.650 --> 01:28:02.820
when you hunted the animal yourself.
So what are your,

1462
01:28:02.821 --> 01:28:06.090
what are you guys making for dinner?
Brisket and ribs,
I hope.

1463
01:28:06.210 --> 01:28:10.950
Delicious brisket and ribs.
Ribs.
And the brisket need to be eaten.

1464
01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:15.350
I want to try your brisket.
I want to try my brisket.
It's a pretty tough cut.

1465
01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:18.300
Immediately.
The ribs and the brisket or you're excited to have a rib?
Oh,

1466
01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:22.110
well my baby back baby back ribs.
Yeah,
that's what I'm talking about.

1467
01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:26.690
<v 9>Okay.
There is the third richest guy in the world.
First of all,</v>

1468
01:28:26.691 --> 01:28:31.460
is that his house?
I don't know.
I hope that's his house.
Very expensive girl.

1469
01:28:31.461 --> 01:28:35.870
That egg grill.
Yeah,
those are good.
The uh,
the,

1470
01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:39.860
it's Mark Zuckerberg for those.
Again,
Mark Zuckerberg was worth like $30 billion.

1471
01:28:39.861 --> 01:28:42.920
Why are you even doing videos?
First of all?
Probably.

1472
01:28:43.210 --> 01:28:48.110
Why are you apologizing to us?
First of all,
I know,
I'm sure someone at Facebook,

1473
01:28:48.111 --> 01:28:51.470
it was like,
you should do this.
It'll make you look human.
Yeah,
that's right.

1474
01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:54.590
We've done is Ysu and making it not look like a diabolical while.

1475
01:28:54.591 --> 01:28:57.680
That's what they said to Garth Brooks.
They go,
you need to do social media.

1476
01:28:57.681 --> 01:29:00.830
And Garth was reluctant and then that's what happens when they don't want to do

1477
01:29:00.831 --> 01:29:02.940
it and they're automatons inside.

1478
01:29:02.941 --> 01:29:05.520
They're dead inside and they wanted to be relatable and they're not related to,

1479
01:29:05.521 --> 01:29:09.420
what did he say?
It tastes better when you kill it yourself.
Does he hunt?

1480
01:29:09.450 --> 01:29:10.440
Was that what he was doing?

1481
01:29:10.650 --> 01:29:15.480
He was trying to get Rogan's crowd trying to tap into somebody who wrote that to

1482
01:29:15.481 --> 01:29:18.150
him and he was like reading the comics.
Looks like he's reading comics.

1483
01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:23.100
Oh it's like an Instagram.
Pli.
I own this APP.
I should see how it works.

1484
01:29:23.101 --> 01:29:27.540
I love the idea that we can use him as a puppet and just comment on his lives

1485
01:29:27.541 --> 01:29:31.120
and he'll do whatever we say.
Really,
really funny.

1486
01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:35.130
Like someone went baby back ribs.
He was like,
check this shit out.

1487
01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:40.820
Which is that same Garth weird humor response where they're like,
they have like,

1488
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:45.490
like 60 year old dad humor.
You know somebody wrote here man.

1489
01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:50.280
Yeah,
that's what I'm talking about.

1490
01:29:51.690 --> 01:29:56.030
See that's how I am now.
I have to
get excited.

1491
01:29:56.070 --> 01:30:00.120
Instagram lives I now,
it's so exciting when you're first seeing it,
but to them,

1492
01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:03.570
I don't do a lot of Instagram lives for that reason cause I just,

1493
01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:07.740
I just repeat the comment terrible.
It's bound to it.

1494
01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:10.950
I don't really know how I'm supposed to do that.
That's it's endearing.

1495
01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:15.630
I haven't seen Garth Brooks this.
Have you seen James Brolin's?
He,

1496
01:30:15.690 --> 01:30:19.710
have you seen how he um,
he posted one of just his bare ass and cowboy boots.

1497
01:30:20.170 --> 01:30:23.920
Like good for him.
He goes for it and he looks at it and go for it.

1498
01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:25.860
He seems like he's,
he's living his best life.

1499
01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:30.890
I think a lot of people don't quite know that it,

1500
01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:34.860
that it goes to everybody.
You know what I mean?
I feel like a lot of people,

1501
01:30:34.861 --> 01:30:36.310
I used to think this,
let's go on to my friends.

1502
01:30:36.570 --> 01:30:39.420
You just think it's like a mass text to your friends and then you realize like,

1503
01:30:39.421 --> 01:30:43.830
no,
like news reporters following like journalists follow you,

1504
01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:46.710
you know?
Um,
yeah.
I was going to put,

1505
01:30:46.711 --> 01:30:50.100
I was going to do an Instagram live after that.
That's what's so messed up.

1506
01:30:50.130 --> 01:30:54.330
When my guy proposed,
I literally was like,
how are we gonna get a picture of it?

1507
01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:58.200
At first my first thought was like,
is there a picture?
How am I need a picture?

1508
01:30:58.230 --> 01:31:03.090
And my second thought was say no as a joke.
Oh No,

1509
01:31:04.030 --> 01:31:07.350
you're having this reaction.
Cause I was like,
oh my God,

1510
01:31:07.351 --> 01:31:09.600
the fact that another common cause I was like,
just say no.

1511
01:31:09.601 --> 01:31:14.160
It just go and then be like,
yes,
of course.
And then I was like,

1512
01:31:14.161 --> 01:31:15.600
don't do it,
don't do it,
don't do it.

1513
01:31:15.601 --> 01:31:19.920
And I like froze like you know how like computers like rebuffering stream.

1514
01:31:20.020 --> 01:31:24.200
I was like,
don't,
don't,
don't jog.
And then I was crying and I could end,

1515
01:31:24.410 --> 01:31:27.360
but it my brain,
I said,
you know,
I was like,
oh should I have done that?

1516
01:31:27.361 --> 01:31:29.250
And I asked him,
I was like,
would that have been funny?
And he was like,

1517
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:34.020
I would have doubted this forever.
Yeah,
I had done that.
You Monster,

1518
01:31:34.650 --> 01:31:37.590
you have to have a real moment.
I know it just has comedy programming.

1519
01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:39.630
I was just like,
oh I should like make a joke out of it.
And then I was like,

1520
01:31:39.631 --> 01:31:40.680
there's something wrong.

1521
01:31:40.681 --> 01:31:45.681
But like social media and all have like totally toxified my brain.

1522
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:49.830
You know,
it's interesting.
Tommy and I together we have our fun,

1523
01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:52.770
like I think behind closed doors we were pretty much the same people,

1524
01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:58.130
but we don't joke a lot.
Right.
Really boring usually,

1525
01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:00.100
but yeah,
we joke.

1526
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:04.210
<v 7>We do actually.
Yeah.
No,
we joke a good bit actually,
but I don't know.</v>

1527
01:32:04.270 --> 01:32:07.690
I wouldn't say it there.
Do you ever feel like,
do you ever like,

1528
01:32:08.250 --> 01:32:12.310
like I find this now with social media because there's just this like pressure

1529
01:32:12.311 --> 01:32:15.290
to constantly be posting and like con,
do you,
are you ever like,
oh,

1530
01:32:15.310 --> 01:32:19.600
we have to do a thing,
let's just film this.
No,
you never feel like an obligation.

1531
01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:23.560
I refrain a lot from social media when I,
when I ain't got shit to say.

1532
01:32:23.561 --> 01:32:26.440
I ain't going to say it.
Do you know what I'm saying?
Him?
Yeah.
I fucking care.

1533
01:32:26.441 --> 01:32:28.810
It's not interesting to me,
but I know when I,

1534
01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:32.310
because I'm obsessed with Instagram,
I actually really enjoy other people's,
yeah.

1535
01:32:32.311 --> 01:32:36.000
Yeah.
And you find that it's just the same shit over and over.
Like totally,

1536
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:39.820
here's the dog in me,
here's the sandwich.
Here's the thing.

1537
01:32:39.821 --> 01:32:43.480
I literally talking about my feed,
but it's everybody's feeling totally.
I'm like,

1538
01:32:43.510 --> 01:32:46.680
I'm just looking at the same shit every day,
but I still like it.

1539
01:32:46.681 --> 01:32:49.120
I don't want to just do another thing that other people have to stare at that

1540
01:32:49.121 --> 01:32:49.960
they've already seen,

1541
01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:52.930
which in turn should that should be the argument from me doing it more cause I'm

1542
01:32:52.931 --> 01:32:57.010
like,
oh,
that must be other people enjoy the now right of minutia there just,

1543
01:32:57.011 --> 01:33:01.180
we'll go an idiot idiot idiot and you're like,
dude,
I'm going to be another,

1544
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:03.100
I just,
it's like sort of this social media,

1545
01:33:03.101 --> 01:33:06.460
like this is the part of the business that I haven't wrapped my head around

1546
01:33:06.461 --> 01:33:10.330
because it's such a big tool and I'm so like,
no,
you're great at it.

1547
01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:14.140
I think you should give yourself credit because you're very vulnerable and I

1548
01:33:14.141 --> 01:33:19.141
would say that is so hard to do on Instagram and brave and great and it's,

1549
01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:22.570
it's worked for you.
I think you've,
you've done it.
That's really nice.

1550
01:33:22.571 --> 01:33:25.000
I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing.
It's like I feel,
I don't know.

1551
01:33:25.001 --> 01:33:28.960
It doesn't,
but there's some people that I feel like do it well.
You know,

1552
01:33:28.961 --> 01:33:31.990
and I'm just like,
I mean,
just the Garth Brooks talking into a thing.

1553
01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:33.730
It's just like,
what are your car with bro?
Like what?

1554
01:33:34.090 --> 01:33:37.090
Do they have to do it or do they want to do it?
That's always my question.

1555
01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:41.610
You should be doing,
you should be on social media.
I had to check off.

1556
01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:42.731
Yeah.

1557
01:33:42.731 --> 01:33:45.520
I had that conversation with Dmitri Martin the other day because he's just like,

1558
01:33:45.521 --> 01:33:47.050
I don't know how to do this,
and I'm like,
dude,

1559
01:33:47.051 --> 01:33:50.480
you're perfect for social media and these one liners,
just fill it.

1560
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:52.930
He was just like,
I don't want to be like,
hey guys.
I'm like,

1561
01:33:52.931 --> 01:33:54.550
you don't just do it your way.

1562
01:33:54.850 --> 01:33:59.440
Garth does let the conversation slicks that.
That's really weird.

1563
01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:04.450
Is he touring or it's just for him?
No,
he's torn arena tour.

1564
01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:07.050
He's stadium tours.
He's Garth Brooks.

1565
01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:10.420
He's crazy.

1566
01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.010
<v 14>A Little Dick faggot.</v>

1567
01:34:18.150 --> 01:34:22.120
You got a little fucking teeny Derek,
Huh?
Yeah,
but you do.

1568
01:34:25.970 --> 01:34:29.960
Yeah.
Your Dick a little,
no wonder you're fucking gay.

1569
01:34:30.150 --> 01:34:32.990
That's because you can't please a fucking woman.
Isn't that right?

1570
01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:36.610
Some women have a little,

1571
01:34:37.130 --> 01:34:41.660
you decided to be a fucking faggot because you can't please a woman.

1572
01:34:41.661 --> 01:34:45.590
And I'm sure you've heard,
oh,
is it in yet?

1573
01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:49.310
That was cause they can't fucking feel it.

1574
01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:53.120
They can't fool your dick cause you're such a fucking loser.

1575
01:34:53.630 --> 01:34:56.090
You're such a little fucking little Dick.

1576
01:34:56.410 --> 01:34:58.760
<v 9>You know what's crazy?
He got paid to do.</v>

1577
01:34:58.761 --> 01:35:01.880
There's one thing that's crazy about this.
Somebody paid him to do that.
Oh,

1578
01:35:03.410 --> 01:35:07.010
I bet they love this.
I bet their psych that this is their new ad.

1579
01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:11.310
This guy is,
it's fine to humiliate.
So you,

1580
01:35:11.311 --> 01:35:15.260
you hit him up on Skype and you have to pay him and he humiliates you.

1581
01:35:15.670 --> 01:35:18.610
Is it like a serve?
It's like a sexual,
like as a fetish shit.

1582
01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:22.240
I know I'm really into dominate.
Trick says like,

1583
01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:26.520
I could do it.
I feel like I could do for you.
You'd be great at it.

1584
01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:30.080
Now I'd be like,
I'm sorry.
No,
I'd be like,

1585
01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:34.690
this is a thing that's obviously a trauma happened to you.
All right.

1586
01:35:35.650 --> 01:35:39.900
Like this is a maladaptive response.
Here's what I would do.
Master

1587
01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:46.550
EA.
But there's something,
um,
I,
I,
I'd be like,
Hey,

1588
01:35:46.551 --> 01:35:50.500
can we work on the lightning?
Like I would just terror and horror,

1589
01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:54.560
which is why he's perfect for this.
How much money is it?
How much?
I don't know.

1590
01:35:54.561 --> 01:35:56.180
Everyone has their own rates and you know,

1591
01:35:56.181 --> 01:35:58.790
we don't want to get into their personal business,
but I'm not sure.

1592
01:35:58.791 --> 01:36:03.020
I'm not sure what he charges.
But I'd be interested.
Would you,
you could do this.

1593
01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:06.470
We do this.
Should I do,
if I weren't married with an a mom,

1594
01:36:06.650 --> 01:36:09.530
I would do fart videos.
Cause that's just easy money.
But it's just your,

1595
01:36:09.531 --> 01:36:14.450
but have you found the girl that sits on cakes?
Course.
I'll do that.

1596
01:36:14.990 --> 01:36:19.190
I can do that.
I could do fart and I could kick guys in the nuts.
No problem.

1597
01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:21.440
You could into.
No,
I would.

1598
01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:26.360
I would do it for how I've always had started under the answer.
36 years old.

1599
01:36:26.570 --> 01:36:28.880
How do you kick someone in the nuts but not the dick.

1600
01:36:30.110 --> 01:36:33.090
You have to hold this no practice.
No.

1601
01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:36.860
Those nuts will usually like the way that they hang.
If you kick,

1602
01:36:36.861 --> 01:36:38.580
you're going to kick the balls.
Dick,

1603
01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:43.880
when does your dick her when it gets kicked also,
it's just the nuts part.
Really.

1604
01:36:43.881 --> 01:36:47.510
Your Dick doesn't hurt if you get your kicked in the Dick.
It's very,

1605
01:36:47.511 --> 01:36:51.110
the way that they lay together.
Your balls are much more sensitive.
Sure.

1606
01:36:51.111 --> 01:36:54.570
If you get hit in the balls,
you feel it up inside of your,

1607
01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:59.180
your abdominal area and it fucking really hurt.

1608
01:36:59.210 --> 01:37:03.410
But your Dick only her like I feel like during sex,
if it jams,

1609
01:37:03.411 --> 01:37:05.820
that's the thing that hurts the deck.
Right.

1610
01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:11.110
Jams when he called Jama,
know the Dick like if you miss,
you know what I mean?

1611
01:37:11.111 --> 01:37:13.100
You can.
You can break it.
You can break a break.
A tech.

1612
01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:15.650
Tommy's head is dig broken.
Really?
Yeah.

1613
01:37:15.651 --> 01:37:18.980
He's talked about it on stronger like a million years ago.
That's a bummer.

1614
01:37:19.770 --> 01:37:24.030
Rodman talked about that.
Oh,
Rodman got his cartilage.
Cartilage.

1615
01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:29.510
There's blood vessels that can pop.
That's not great.
I don't think I could fart.

1616
01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:34.740
I don't think I could fart in front.
You're not foreign in front of your heart.

1617
01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:39.190
No.
Well,
you got to change that right quick.
Our lifetime of holding weird,

1618
01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:41.060
but what about when did you get,

1619
01:37:41.061 --> 01:37:43.940
when was the first time you got half artists stop at one month and do it?

1620
01:37:43.941 --> 01:37:46.770
He put my hand in his crotch and he farted on my head.

1621
01:37:49.610 --> 01:37:52.750
That's a month in Whitney.
This is disgust like our whole life is this guy.

1622
01:37:52.850 --> 01:37:56.010
I don't think farming's is.
I think it's funny.
I would love to do it with him.
We

1623
01:37:56.010 --> 01:38:00.070
just don't.
He's done and in front of me,
but I try to not do it.

1624
01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:05.460
Gotta do it.
You got to do it.
Otherwise it's a lifetime of holding.

1625
01:38:05.461 --> 01:38:07.710
I remember Howard was saying the key to his relationship,
his,

1626
01:38:07.711 --> 01:38:11.610
they have separate bathrooms.
I know he doesn't like it when Beth.
Oh yeah.

1627
01:38:11.611 --> 01:38:14.050
They've never talks about pooting.
No.
Well,

1628
01:38:14.051 --> 01:38:17.880
what about Angel Angel?

1629
01:38:18.150 --> 01:38:21.300
I follow her on Instagram.
We'll talk about yes,
off.
My thing is,

1630
01:38:21.301 --> 01:38:24.090
but what about when you have to Brown?
Do you announce it?

1631
01:38:24.330 --> 01:38:26.670
What do you do when you're hanging out and you got to go take a brand?

1632
01:38:26.671 --> 01:38:28.200
I just pretend I'm,
I'm just,

1633
01:38:28.201 --> 01:38:31.290
I pretend I'm doing something else and I spray perfume around the bathroom and I

1634
01:38:31.291 --> 01:38:35.550
turned the faucet on.
Yeah.
I just pretend to like,
in his mind,
I've never,
oh wait,

1635
01:38:35.551 --> 01:38:38.140
wait,
wait.
But what if it's a hot brown?
What if it's a sick brown?

1636
01:38:39.370 --> 01:38:43.620
You've got diarrhea.
I go future.
I tell them like,
oh,

1637
01:38:43.621 --> 01:38:46.600
I've got to go get a dry cleaning,
and I go do it at Starbucks.
Yeah.

1638
01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:50.250
I just go somewhere and do it somewhere else.
Go somewhere.
Or I'll just be like,

1639
01:38:50.251 --> 01:38:52.890
hey,
I have to make this call.
I'll just lie.
I mean,

1640
01:38:53.010 --> 01:38:56.490
I feel like a good relationship is built on just lies.
Right?
So that helps me.

1641
01:38:56.820 --> 01:38:58.470
Yeah.
I'm like,
I gotta go do this call real quick.

1642
01:38:58.471 --> 01:39:00.120
Are you going to be in here for a minute?
All right,
I'm going to go in here.

1643
01:39:00.210 --> 01:39:01.830
I'm gonna go take a bath.
That's a big one.

1644
01:39:01.831 --> 01:39:04.190
And I just turned on the bath water and just wet my,

1645
01:39:04.191 --> 01:39:08.870
I'm like this none in your business.
He doesn't know how to do this.

1646
01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:11.820
I'm like,
I have to do this.
I have to call her to talks podcast,

1647
01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:14.910
talked to the president of the comedy writing the presence,

1648
01:39:14.911 --> 01:39:17.700
show businesses calls.
So you must have,

1649
01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:20.070
you must have a few bathrooms in your house.

1650
01:39:20.071 --> 01:39:23.250
I'm hoping that like a safe haven I do.
My bathroom is like,

1651
01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:27.810
because it's also like I feel like I got this thing in my head a couple of years

1652
01:39:27.810 --> 01:39:29.550
ago where people used to say like,
oh yeah,

1653
01:39:29.551 --> 01:39:31.500
with the stuff you talk about in your special,

1654
01:39:31.530 --> 01:39:34.740
it's just like a deterrent to guys.
So in my head I was like okay,

1655
01:39:34.741 --> 01:39:39.720
in my personal life I have to like overcorrect and not do anything polarizing or

1656
01:39:39.721 --> 01:39:42.460
whatever.
Cause in my standup I'm like talking about squirting,
you know,

1657
01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:44.070
all that kind of stuff.
So it's like,
okay,

1658
01:39:44.071 --> 01:39:47.760
like in my personal life I should probably tone it down,
which might not be true,

1659
01:39:47.761 --> 01:39:50.000
but it's like a narrative I have in my head.
No,
it's so interesting.

1660
01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:53.700
I was just telling Tom about how liberating it must be when you no longer have

1661
01:39:53.701 --> 01:39:56.010
to be sexually viable to men.
Like,

1662
01:39:56.011 --> 01:40:00.090
imagine how much funnier you're going to be like both of us when we're like

1663
01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:04.680
totally barren,
post-menopausal,
just shoplifting.

1664
01:40:05.370 --> 01:40:08.760
Fucking what?
Every year.
I'll constantly,

1665
01:40:09.450 --> 01:40:12.410
I feel like the reason him and I,
the reason I wanted to be with it,

1666
01:40:12.411 --> 01:40:15.990
like I feel like I can just be garbage around him.
She's basically saying,

1667
01:40:15.991 --> 01:40:20.750
when you're this lady,
okay,
five residential,
hey,
fuck you.

1668
01:40:20.910 --> 01:40:25.110
Both of you,
25 25 residential.

1669
01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:30.960
What does that mean
to you?
Fuck you.

1670
01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:35.730
Fuck you.
Love her.
You love her.

1671
01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:38.590
That's why I might be four months away from that shit.

1672
01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:43.760
Love that lover or straight to a man.

1673
01:40:44.670 --> 01:40:47.490
That's 20 out of 25 is the speed limit.
Yeah.
I don't know.

1674
01:40:47.491 --> 01:40:51.540
It was just kind of her like when you're 25 years,
the lover of the fucking dog,

1675
01:40:51.541 --> 01:40:53.060
the whole deal that's going to be mean.
You know what's

1676
01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:59.520
<v 14>the fact that quite a lot of breaths on me abusing you.</v>

1677
01:41:00.690 --> 01:41:03.940
Oh,
the fact that you're a little fucking little faggot Dick.

1678
01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:08.110
I've seen bigger belly buttons.
Then your Dick,

1679
01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:15.650
<v 9>he didn't get the F gt then he doesn't write it out first.</v>

1680
01:41:15.651 --> 01:41:19.790
He's got to date and revising my job.
I'd write the insults out.

1681
01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:24.540
I think so like a pass.
I was like,

1682
01:41:25.890 --> 01:41:28.970
fuck you.
Like you said,
coming up with that,
like prepare for your job.

1683
01:41:29.410 --> 01:41:32.570
See how over prepare.
I love it when he's still working all at Gwinnett.

1684
01:41:32.571 --> 01:41:36.230
Come from there.
A perfectionist,
like even in the impromptu insults was like,

1685
01:41:36.231 --> 01:41:40.140
you don't want to have them in my pocket if someone punches up to business.

1686
01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:42.880
I love it.
I love it.
It's like,
let's make a business out of this.

1687
01:41:42.881 --> 01:41:44.760
Let's say this could be a thing.

1688
01:41:45.370 --> 01:41:49.370
<v 0>Um,
just so people can,
where are you?
Where are you going to be?</v>

1689
01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:54.180
<v 9>Oh Gosh.
Um,
I'm doing,
I'm going to Nashville.
I'm going to Salt Lake City.</v>

1690
01:41:54.190 --> 01:41:57.390
I'm going to Raleigh and doing the whole deal.
You do it.
Oh yeah,

1691
01:41:57.391 --> 01:42:01.140
I'm trying to go to non La,
New York.
I'm trying to go everywhere.

1692
01:42:01.170 --> 01:42:03.390
That's where you got intense comics.
It's like when you work in a special,

1693
01:42:03.391 --> 01:42:05.340
you can't just go to the,
you know,

1694
01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:10.050
places you said flappers I just did two Sunday nights and the you who room in a

1695
01:42:10.051 --> 01:42:14.700
row and yeah.
The reason being,
you've got mall people,
these are valley.

1696
01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:19.380
That's your normal fucking people.
People who like chain restaurants.
Yeah.

1697
01:42:19.390 --> 01:42:22.410
Jail.
If they laugh,
you know you got something.
People that are watching.

1698
01:42:22.411 --> 01:42:24.630
It's like you don't just want to be doing comedy for your friends.

1699
01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:26.760
I think a lot of times we get so myopic.

1700
01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:32.530
<v 0>Big Word.
These are all knit man.
She's working.

She's coming to your city.
Bakersfield.

1703
01:42:40.911 --> 01:42:43.060
Cleveland.
Oh,
sorry.
That's already part of that was already,

1704
01:42:43.110 --> 01:42:47.510
I'm so Sacramento was spoken.
Vegas,
La Jolla.
Salt Lake.

1705
01:42:47.650 --> 01:42:51.520
Nashville's Christ.
What a nightmare.
Budget cities stressful.
Um,

1706
01:42:51.620 --> 01:42:53.420
see her live by her books.

1707
01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:57.630
I don't think I've ever been to Salt Lake City for common.
Right?
Oh good.

1708
01:42:58.110 --> 01:42:59.120
Are you doing Sir Greg?

1709

Never met.
You're going to have fun.
I totally knew hour.</v>

1710

No politics.
Not One politic or you go zero hero.
It's like,

1711
01:43:08.341 --> 01:43:11.720
I feel like people are gonna know that.
You know what I mean?
Smart girl.
Yeah.

1712
01:43:11.770 --> 01:43:14.520
It's like,
Nah,
it's over right.
No one wants to hear him.

1713
01:43:14.521 --> 01:43:19.200
No one wants to go see comedy and like getting a fight.
I know their spouse.

1714
01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:22.980
Anything else,
Jean?
You know,
watch the degenerates.
I am,

1715
01:43:22.981 --> 01:43:25.890

1716
01:43:25.891 --> 01:43:30.240
the number of the beast to watch that,
the ride or die tour,

1717
01:43:30.570 --> 01:43:35.460
check out the 2019 dates on Christina p online.
Did the den degenerates.

1718
01:43:35.461 --> 01:43:38.860
Just dropped like yesterday the day.
Great.

1719
01:43:39.100 --> 01:43:42.640
<v 0>Um,
and as we mentioned earlier,
this is a rare occasion,</v>

1720
01:43:42.641 --> 01:43:47.641
but we're going to take you right now to our in depth conversation with Kate

1721
01:43:48.490 --> 01:43:49.323
from below

1722
01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:52.010
<v 9>who was in here.
And</v>

1723
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:55.370
<v 0>that will be that.
Thank you guys.
We'll see you next week.
Thank you Whitney.</v>

1724
01:43:55.371 --> 01:43:59.570
Very much.
It's fantastic.
Best.
Oh God.
You're amazing.

1725
01:44:00.290 --> 01:44:02.420
This is so exciting.

1726
01:44:02.710 --> 01:44:06.590
We've never been more excited to have a guest ever.

1727
01:44:06.710 --> 01:44:10.460
And we must do a proper introduction because whenever we discuss reality,

1728
01:44:10.461 --> 01:44:11.294
you know,
it's real.
Yeah.

1729
01:44:11.410 --> 01:44:14.640
<v 15>Hell yeah.
Hell yeah.</v>

1730
01:44:15.890 --> 01:44:18.890
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

1731
01:44:19.540 --> 01:44:22.210
<v 0>Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Do you want to go ahead and do an introduction?</v>

1732
01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:26.770
I am so excited right now.
I mean,
we've had many famous people in studio.

1733
01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:29.470
You are by far.
I'm just,
I'm so excited.

1734
01:44:29.471 --> 01:44:33.400
I'm so star struck right now to be sitting next to the one and only k Chast

1735
01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:37.930
Dayne from below deck.
Ooh.
Ooh.
We've watched you for years.

1736
01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:41.740
I feel like we've been watching you for decades and it's only been a few years

1737
01:44:41.770 --> 01:44:45.730
working on boats for decades.
But yeah,
it's been a five seasons now.
Five seasons.

1738
01:44:45.731 --> 01:44:47.710
For those that don't know,
that are listening,
watching,

1739
01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:52.010
we are hardcore fans of below deck.
Uh,

1740
01:44:52.011 --> 01:44:55.710
the Bravo TV show that takes you on mega yachts,

1741
01:44:55.711 --> 01:44:59.950
super yachts with a full crew of which,
uh,
uh,
Kate has,

1742
01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:04.310
is a chief's do,
uh,
that's in person.
No.
Yeah.
The person is,

1743
01:45:04.650 --> 01:45:07.510
you have to speak to the people that don't know the person in charge of the

1744
01:45:07.511 --> 01:45:11.140
interior.
This is service,
uh,
making sure that,
you know,

1745
01:45:11.141 --> 01:45:15.780
the rooms are clean and tidy,
make sure everything looks great.
Presentable.
Yeah.

1746
01:45:15.790 --> 01:45:18.490
It's like running a boutique hotel.
Exactly.
The ocean.

1747
01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:23.200
It's like you're at like a beautiful hotel and you want nothing but impeccable

1748
01:45:23.201 --> 01:45:25.210
service.
And what we've discovered first of all,

1749
01:45:25.211 --> 01:45:28.030
is that not only did we love impeccable service in real life,

1750
01:45:28.300 --> 01:45:32.980
we love watching people,
uh,
deliver impeccable service on reality TV.

1751
01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:36.280
And we love watching people who know great service,
uh,

1752
01:45:36.430 --> 01:45:39.400
yell at people who don't know how to provide impeccable service.

1753
01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:43.540
And you certainly would enjoy below deck.
It's so great.
We're so into it.

1754
01:45:44.050 --> 01:45:44.381
And you know,

1755
01:45:44.381 --> 01:45:48.550
what I love best about it is that it's kind of like Downton Abbey when you think

1756
01:45:48.580 --> 01:45:52.390
that some people have said,
yeah,
didn't it start at this around the same time?

1757
01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:56.620
I think that was the original pitch that Bravo had in mind where it's like

1758
01:45:56.770 --> 01:46:00.370
Downton Abbey on the ocean.
Yeah.
It makes total sense.
Yeah.
Upstairs,

1759
01:46:00.371 --> 01:46:04.390
downstairs world.
That's right.
Yeah,
that's right.
And you end up,
of course,

1760
01:46:04.391 --> 01:46:07.450
being much more fascinated by downstairs.
Oh,
that's the thing.

1761
01:46:07.451 --> 01:46:09.670
That's where all the good stuff,
that's where all the good stuff happens.

1762
01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:13.810
How did you,
okay,
so anybody can obviously check out the show.
You're,

1763
01:46:13.811 --> 01:46:16.300
you're going to be into it.
It's so great.
There's so many character.

1764
01:46:16.301 --> 01:46:20.080
But like before obviously the show,
you've been working on yachts,

1765
01:46:20.170 --> 01:46:22.150
how did it even come about?
How did it start?

1766
01:46:22.270 --> 01:46:25.090
My cousin had done it in the 90s which I really respect because there was no

1767
01:46:25.091 --> 01:46:26.980
internet.
So once you set out on that boat,

1768
01:46:26.981 --> 01:46:28.780
you were like cut off from civilization.

1769
01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:32.200
So she would send us postcards every now and then from every different country.

1770
01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:35.140
And I was like,
oh,
that sounds cool.
And then after college graduation I was like,

1771
01:46:35.590 --> 01:46:38.560
I don't want to get a real job yet.
Yeah.
So I was like,
oh,

1772
01:46:38.561 --> 01:46:42.250
I'll just do yachting for one year and then I'll make money and then I'll come

1773
01:46:42.251 --> 01:46:45.320
back and you know,
figure it out.
You'll meet your billionaire boyfriend.
Yeah.

1774
01:46:45.330 --> 01:46:48.640
Really my plan,
you know?
So I was like,
oh well just,
you know,

1775
01:46:49.050 --> 01:46:50.160
float off into the sunset

1776
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:52.320
<v 7>with a billionaire.
That didn't exactly happen.</v>

1777
01:46:52.321 --> 01:46:56.160
But I did end up doing it for like seven years because once you start working on

1778
01:46:56.161 --> 01:46:58.860
yachts,
you feel like you've won the lottery.
You have,

1779
01:46:58.890 --> 01:47:03.430
it feels like exotic summer camp for adults that are cool,
bunk bed,

1780
01:47:03.431 --> 01:47:06.660
shared meal times.
You put a five star chef cooking your food,

1781
01:47:06.661 --> 01:47:09.840
you've got no bill of it.
You're all living on this yacht.
Uh,

1782
01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:13.050
possession is 90% of ownership.
If the,
if the owners aren't there,

1783
01:47:13.051 --> 01:47:13.890
it's your yacht.

1784
01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:17.430
You're using their tender to go wakeboarding everyday after work.

1785
01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:21.240
It's just feels amazing and then that wears off.

1786
01:47:22.410 --> 01:47:25.350
But you feel like you're always chasing that first year dragon.
Well,

1787
01:47:25.351 --> 01:47:28.920
here's the thing,
because Tom and I,
every season without fail,

1788
01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:32.850
we marvel at how hard you guys work.

1789
01:47:32.851 --> 01:47:35.880
And we sit there and we're like,
how do these people do this?

1790
01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:37.840
Like you're not sleeping.
Um,

1791
01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:42.000
and the exterior has it rough because of the heat and the salt.

1792
01:47:42.001 --> 01:47:44.910
And then you guys have it rough because of the drunk people.

1793
01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:47.830
He pull your deal also do it.

1794
01:47:48.230 --> 01:47:51.540
When you see on a reality show to those cameras are always rolling.

1795
01:47:51.541 --> 01:47:56.541
It's like one in the morning doing dishes hates up three in the morning.

1796
01:47:56.551 --> 01:47:59.360
It's a lot of work,
but you're stuck on the boat.

1797
01:47:59.361 --> 01:48:03.180
So there's not much more to do and you're making such good money that it's kind

1798
01:48:03.181 --> 01:48:05.670
of worth it.
Uh,
it taught me a lot about cleaning.

1799
01:48:05.671 --> 01:48:08.610
It taught me a lot about laundry and a lot,

1800
01:48:08.611 --> 01:48:10.300
I didn't know any of that before I started in boy.

1801
01:48:10.301 --> 01:48:13.740
And now my favorite thing to do is iron sheets.
Yeah,
it's so relaxed.

1802
01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:16.950
So can you tell it like people,
what kind of money?

1803
01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:22.890
So like a first year,
Stuart asked,
I think I started out,
I own 189 foot yacht,

1804
01:48:22.891 --> 01:48:25.560
which is pretty big.
So a third to of that size vessel.

1805
01:48:25.561 --> 01:48:28.890
But I was making like 2,500 bucks a month.
And that's,
that's not bad.

1806
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:31.740
Learn for young,
but,
but you,
that's all disposable income.

1807
01:48:32.190 --> 01:48:35.580
And so then if you're not paying rent,
nothing,

1808
01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:40.770
no expenses.
And a lot of times we're in an international waters and they're like

1809
01:48:40.890 --> 01:48:45.300
international a bosses.
So then if you're on a charter boat,

1810
01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:49.140
on top of that,
you get tips.
So let's say I was on a,
uh,

1811
01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:53.100
one 60 foot boat.
I was second stu,
I was making four grand a month.

1812
01:48:53.101 --> 01:48:56.160
And then we had a busy charter December where we did like four charters.

1813
01:48:56.370 --> 01:48:59.520
So I made about 16,000 and tips.

1814
01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:03.420
So in December of 2013 I made 20 grand.
Just all

1815
01:49:07.010 --> 01:49:09.870
work doesn't seem as much when you compare it to

1816
01:49:12.410 --> 01:49:17.010
let's do dishes,
man.
Yeah.
And you're with a crew that's international,

1817
01:49:17.011 --> 01:49:21.750
young,
well traveled.
It's fun when everybody knows how to do their job.

1818
01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:23.040
Yachting is actually fun.

1819
01:49:23.070 --> 01:49:26.010
It's when you've got the inexperienced people that it becomes less.

1820
01:49:26.300 --> 01:49:30.690
How much that a reality of what's happening to you not being,

1821
01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:34.860
not filmed.
Like you're out there,
you're working.
How often are you dealing with,

1822
01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:37.110
you know,
undertrained pretty often.
No,
I mean,

1823
01:49:37.111 --> 01:49:40.080
I think green people start on private boats.
Charter boats are a little bit more,

1824
01:49:40.130 --> 01:49:44.520
um,
intense schedule,
a little more demanding.
So usually to get on a charter boat,

1825
01:49:44.521 --> 01:49:48.820
you'd have at least a year.
You know what you're doing slightly,
you get it.

1826
01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:52.000
What's the difference between a private and a charter?
A private yacht is,
well,

1827
01:49:52.001 --> 01:49:56.660
all yachts are owned by somebody so rich that we don't even know who they are.

1828
01:49:56.760 --> 01:50:01.210
Like a rush they paid where you can't Google them.

1829
01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:02.170
Like Ah,

1830
01:50:02.170 --> 01:50:06.400
there's one Russian arms dealer that has a yacht that just goes around the South

1831
01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:07.270
Pacific and they,

1832
01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:10.480
he never visits and I'm pretty sure he's just got something on that boat that

1833
01:50:10.481 --> 01:50:14.170
he's keeping moving.
Yeah.
So my friends on the made on that belt,

1834
01:50:14.171 --> 01:50:15.710
he's got a great life.
Um,

1835
01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:21.190
and so a lot of time to offset the cost of these yachts because just to keep it

1836
01:50:21.191 --> 01:50:25.450
running a year is about $4 million budget with staff and with cleaning supplies.

1837
01:50:26.530 --> 01:50:31.030
So to offset that cost,
they'll charter,
they'll rent it out for weeks at a time.

1838
01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:35.590
Cause that's what we noticed.
It seems like constant cleaning.

1839
01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:40.620
The exterior crew is wiping that boat down 24 seven that's job security for sure

1840
01:50:41.500 --> 01:50:43.240
for us.
But it is such an expensive vessel.

1841
01:50:43.241 --> 01:50:46.240
And I would always feel guilty when the owners weren't,
well not that guilty,

1842
01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:48.880
but if the owners weren't visiting,
I'm like,
Gosh,

1843
01:50:48.881 --> 01:50:50.350
there's paying me like hanging on their boat.

1844
01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:53.710
But I've worked on boats that tried to cut corners and didn't have a full time

1845
01:50:53.711 --> 01:50:57.010
crew and with something that expensive as an investment,

1846
01:50:57.130 --> 01:51:00.100
well not really an investment,
but if you spend that much money on a boat,

1847
01:51:00.101 --> 01:51:02.500
you want it to stay in good condition.

1848
01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:07.390
Now I was just up last night reading my favorite book.

1849
01:51:07.570 --> 01:51:11.260
Oh low Kate chestain lucky,
charming.

1850
01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:15.460
And what struck me about you a or a fantastic writer,
you're very funny.

1851
01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:17.350
It was just this the first of all,
that's why we love you.

1852
01:51:17.380 --> 01:51:21.640
Your commentary is so funny on this show and what I've always admired about you

1853
01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:26.110
is that you're never afraid to be who you are.
And I think especially as women,

1854
01:51:26.111 --> 01:51:30.430
society has us being polite all the time and smiling and you know,
get it,
get it.

1855
01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:32.470
And you were so refreshing because,

1856
01:51:33.030 --> 01:51:36.760
and I hate using the word the resting bitch.
Right?
Then you're not a bitch.

1857
01:51:36.761 --> 01:51:40.920
You're just a fucking person doing your job.
You're busy.
Yeah,

1858
01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:45.400
that's a little busy over here and their whole resting bitch face thing.

1859
01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:46.990
I had never really thought I had it before.

1860
01:51:46.991 --> 01:51:50.110
I was using that as a defense for the rocket ship.
Lincoln.
I made it.

1861
01:51:50.111 --> 01:51:53.320
I was like a moment of panic because I thought like diversion,
you know,

1862
01:51:53.321 --> 01:51:56.920
just say something and uh,
it,
it's turned out.
It's kind of true though.

1863
01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.030
And I have a resting bitch face.

1864
01:51:58.180 --> 01:52:01.600
Well I just think you're a person who likes what they do.

1865
01:52:01.630 --> 01:52:03.730
You're very professional.
Um,

1866
01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:07.450
but what struck me as interesting is that you come from kind of a fancy pants

1867
01:52:07.451 --> 01:52:10.460
background,
right?
Not really.
I mean,
I went to private school,

1868
01:52:10.461 --> 01:52:14.890
but it's not that fancy.
Um,
but I,
I do enjoy high end service.

1869
01:52:14.891 --> 01:52:18.670
Like I really do love it.
I love being dressed up.

1870
01:52:18.671 --> 01:52:22.420
I love jazz lounges.
I like the finer things in life.

1871
01:52:22.421 --> 01:52:25.270
So my dad offered to get me a new car when I was in college.

1872
01:52:25.271 --> 01:52:28.810
If I majored in nursing because he wanted to make sure I would have a good job,

1873
01:52:29.110 --> 01:52:31.000
but I can't do it.
I can't even watch Grey's anatomy.

1874
01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:35.710
So I want a job that's going to have some element of fun to it.

1875
01:52:35.711 --> 01:52:38.890
Like being in our,
she probably never like this was a fun day,

1876
01:52:39.370 --> 01:52:43.510
but like in high end service there's like people celebrating and having a great

1877
01:52:43.511 --> 01:52:46.400
time and that's why I've always kind of loved that area.
Okay.

1878
01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:48.350
Cause I was thinking like,
oh is she came,

1879
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:51.530
I was just trying to think of how shocking it must have been free of the first

1880
01:52:51.531 --> 01:52:54.920
time you worked on a yacht and you're like,
oh my God,
like I'm really working.

1881
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:56.270
This is really hard.
Yeah.

1882
01:52:56.271 --> 01:52:59.240
That was a big shock because when I went to go work on my first shot,

1883
01:52:59.241 --> 01:53:00.740
I packed my suitcase and I was like,

1884
01:53:00.930 --> 01:53:03.440
I don't know where aviator sunglasses and a scarf around my neck.

1885
01:53:03.740 --> 01:53:05.570
And my friend was like,
yeah,
if they let you,

1886
01:53:05.571 --> 01:53:08.090
I didn't realize how much of the help I would be.
Yeah.

1887
01:53:08.210 --> 01:53:11.990
But we had an engineer on board and he brought his dog on board while we're at

1888
01:53:11.991 --> 01:53:16.190
the dog.
And one day I was cleaning up after the engineer's dog.
That was my job.

1889
01:53:16.191 --> 01:53:20.000
I was below a dog in the hierarchy.
So that was a real wake up call.

1890
01:53:20.001 --> 01:53:24.080
It was a tough adjustment.
How big of an adjustment was that?
Fuge well,

1891
01:53:24.081 --> 01:53:24.771
it wasn't easy,

1892
01:53:24.771 --> 01:53:28.760
but the good thing about the Yod is once I got the job on the boat,

1893
01:53:28.761 --> 01:53:29.720
that taught me everything.

1894
01:53:29.810 --> 01:53:32.150
We're in the middle of the ocean so I couldn't really escape if I wanted to.

1895
01:53:32.151 --> 01:53:36.500
I was kind of forced to evolve,
but I'm thankful for it.
Yeah.
So

1896
01:53:36.850 --> 01:53:40.690
<v 0>it's,
um,
yeah,
it's uh,
I'm,
I'm so fascinated by the wheel.</v>

1897
01:53:40.691 --> 01:53:44.770
I'm also somebody that I feel like I really appreciate,

1898
01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:47.500
appreciate great service and it,

1899
01:53:47.710 --> 01:53:52.180
it kind of like really gets under my skin when I'm somewhere and not getting,

1900
01:53:52.210 --> 01:53:55.120
especially if you're somewhere where it should happen,
you know,

1901
01:53:55.121 --> 01:53:57.070
like you go to a nice hotel and you're like,

1902
01:53:57.100 --> 01:54:00.790
the fuck is going on here with the front desk and no one's answering the phone

1903
01:54:00.791 --> 01:54:02.320
when you call and you're like,
hey,

1904
01:54:02.321 --> 01:54:05.800
I can fortunately that you're hiring a bunt and like,
it's not that I'm a,

1905
01:54:05.801 --> 01:54:10.390
I feel like I'm super demanding,
but I also feel like,
you know,

1906
01:54:10.930 --> 01:54:13.330
I would be,
if I was the person working,

1907
01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:17.260
I would be trying to give great service to the guest.

1908
01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:19.360
It bothers me cause it would,
I wouldn't do it.

1909
01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:22.120
<v 7>I'm not high maintenance,
but I do like things that are fair.
Yeah.</v>

1910
01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:23.610
I were entering this contract that we're,

1911
01:54:23.611 --> 01:54:26.940
I'm going to pay top dollar for a fine experience that I expect them to deliver

1912
01:54:26.941 --> 01:54:27.150
that.

1913
01:54:27.150 --> 01:54:30.130
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
And I also like,
it's also why like if somebody,</v>

1914
01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:34.160
I don't know even talks to you shitty,
you're like,
Yo,
I,

1915
01:54:34.450 --> 01:54:35.890
I treat everyone with respect.

1916
01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:40.100
So the moment I feel like I'm not being treated with respect.
Yeah.

1917
01:54:40.150 --> 01:54:42.010
It just makes my blood boil.
You know,

1918
01:54:42.250 --> 01:54:46.480
<v 7>now at a restaurant,
will you complain or will you know what I do?
I feel bad.</v>

1919
01:54:46.481 --> 01:54:48.400
I don't complain to the restaurant.
I don't complain to the server.

1920
01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:51.040
I put whoever I'm dining with.
I feel so bad because I'll be like,

1921
01:54:51.160 --> 01:54:54.160
thank you so much.
And then they'll walk away.
I'd be like,
God,
this is horrible.

1922
01:54:55.530 --> 01:54:59.050
I'm like,
I don't punish the people.
I don't punish the server.

1923
01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:02.890
I'll comment about it like after they leave and I won't be happy,

1924
01:55:02.891 --> 01:55:05.800
but I am not where there's people that sends things back or anything.

1925
01:55:06.450 --> 01:55:08.490
One time I just some things back because if it,

1926
01:55:08.491 --> 01:55:11.470
if it's inedible and that's on the shadow when you have to be like,
dude,

1927
01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:12.640
I had to,
sorry,

1928
01:55:13.330 --> 01:55:15.510
<v 0>one time I was actually in Florida,</v>

1929
01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:18.600
like a nice steak house and I asked her something medium rare and it was like

1930
01:55:18.601 --> 01:55:21.810
clearly well done and like,
Hey,
oh I sent it back and you know what?

1931
01:55:21.811 --> 01:55:26.160
They brought out a fully like raw piece of meat and I was like,

1932
01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:31.350
okay,
yeah.
I was like,
but I wasn't a dick about it.
I was just like,
Hey,

1933
01:55:31.351 --> 01:55:33.990
this is definitely not medium rare.
And then they were like,

1934
01:55:34.020 --> 01:55:35.880
here's a raw piece of beef.
And I was like,
okay.

1935
01:55:36.330 --> 01:55:38.310
And I didn't make it a thing again.
I was like,

1936
01:55:38.311 --> 01:55:40.650
I took a couple bites and I was like,
oh,
I'm full.
Thank you very much.

1937
01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:44.010
So I don't know,
one time I did do something out of emotion

1938
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:47.460
<v 2>where I got like kind of disrespected by a restaurant.</v>

1939
01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:52.760
So I put up a post on my Instagram and told them to leave negative Yelp reviews

1940
01:55:53.010 --> 01:55:57.080
and they did a thousand a thousand.
I love this kind of stuff.

1941
01:55:57.380 --> 01:56:02.090
I like a creative payback,
you know,

1942
01:56:02.140 --> 01:56:06.570
to just random people.
But if you like slight me,
I love a creative.

1943
01:56:06.630 --> 01:56:10.920
Oh it was great because I think people destroyed their Yelp and then the

1944
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:15.300
restaurant figured it out called the comedy club that I had been working at that

1945
01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:17.760
week and they're like,
we want to talk to him.
And they were like,

1946
01:56:17.761 --> 01:56:18.900
he doesn't work here.

1947
01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:22.380
He's a comedian that passed through and so they couldn't figure it out.

1948
01:56:22.530 --> 01:56:27.450
Eventually though Yelp figures out if something is like spammed,
they fix it.

1949
01:56:27.580 --> 01:56:32.380
But yeah.
But it was very satisfying.
Review Yourself.
No,

1950
01:56:33.870 --> 01:56:36.480
I don't have a profile.
I don't even know.
I don't even have the APP.

1951
01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:38.340
I've tried to even like look at a restaurant I like looking at.

1952
01:56:38.620 --> 01:56:42.360
The only time I did is when I got an infection from a pedicure salon and I was

1953
01:56:42.361 --> 01:56:45.720
like kind of a health thing.
You got to be protected.
The other people,

1954
01:56:45.730 --> 01:56:49.470
that doesn't happen.
That's really the only time I will or a positive.

1955
01:56:49.471 --> 01:56:53.370
Super Positive.
Oh,
the people,
you know,

1956
01:56:54.570 --> 01:56:55.400
there's a couple of things get,

1957
01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:57.900
there's so much stuff that we were like obsessed with on the show.

1958
01:56:58.140 --> 01:57:00.780
One thing that,
so many questions on,
I think you touched on it,

1959
01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:05.990
we don't even went back.
We started watching season two because it was,

1960
01:57:06.750 --> 01:57:10.650
it looks like a documentary compared to like what does like so much raw,

1961
01:57:10.710 --> 01:57:11.610
more raw and rough,

1962
01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:14.700
but I love it because we didn't know what we were doing with the show.

1963
01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:18.840
Like I had no idea.
I was just there to be [inaudible] before.
No,
no,
no.

1964
01:57:19.110 --> 01:57:21.720
Because he has that great line when he goes,
shit,
he goes,

1965
01:57:21.721 --> 01:57:26.280
a k looks like she should be chartering the Ui.
That was really,
really nice.
Well,

1966
01:57:26.281 --> 01:57:27.930
that's another thing that happens when you work on yachts.

1967
01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:31.830
This is why I don't have as much money saved from all those great charter tips

1968
01:57:31.831 --> 01:57:35.190
as I should because you're around the most wealthy people on the planet and you

1969
01:57:35.191 --> 01:57:39.900
start seeing what,
how they live and your tastes kind of automatically.

1970
01:57:39.901 --> 01:57:43.080
You want to live like they do.
So when you have time off,
you're like,
well,

1971
01:57:43.081 --> 01:57:46.230
I made all this money but I work hard.
I deserve to live like them.

1972
01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:51.200
So it's like traps you.
She says Birkin bag.
That's what,

1973
01:57:52.420 --> 01:57:53.940
no,
I would never do that.

1974
01:57:54.020 --> 01:57:58.710
Know that's took the month of December,
2014 all of it.
Yep.

1975
01:57:59.010 --> 01:58:02.190
No,
I would never,
I mean I would,
I'd forgotten she tells,
but Perkins are crazy.

1976
01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:04.570
Yeah.
That's crazy.
How much are they?
I don't even know.
Hey,

1977
01:58:04.620 --> 01:58:09.570
that started like a car.
Okay.
Yeah.
No,
I like Chanel.
That's good enough,

1978
01:58:09.571 --> 01:58:13.890
right?
Yeah.
Coco,
no.
Come on.
You mentioned this.

1979
01:58:13.891 --> 01:58:17.580
How often does it happen?
You mentioned,
I think it's on the recent season,

1980
01:58:17.910 --> 01:58:22.620
the fear of the verbal,
the verbal tip that happens in service as well.

1981
01:58:22.621 --> 01:58:26.640
When someone's like,
you did such a good job.
It's like,
no,
no.

1982
01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:30.000
Oh No.
Cause they're like,
I want you to know.
I appreciate too,

1983
01:58:30.001 --> 01:58:33.540
because I also know that I'm not going to tip you because I'm cheap.

1984
01:58:35.670 --> 01:58:39.090
Does that feel good?
Yeah.
It's an overcompensation for what?

1985
01:58:39.091 --> 01:58:42.130
They're not going to do almost fuckers insult

1986
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:45.270
<v 7>to injury.
It's like,
now I can't even be mean to you,</v>

1987
01:58:45.510 --> 01:58:50.470
like hate you because you're so nice
and I've paid enough.
So anyway.

1988
01:58:50.650 --> 01:58:54.970
Yeah.
So if like,
here's what I'm curious about.
So on the show,
you know,

1989
01:58:54.971 --> 01:58:57.940
people are obviously chartering for a couple days,

1990
01:58:57.941 --> 01:59:02.680
but typically somebody goes on a charter,
a yacht,
a,
it's for a week,

1991
01:59:02.681 --> 01:59:04.450
I think is the standard time,
right?
Let's look at,
yeah.

1992
01:59:04.930 --> 01:59:09.730
So what is the standard for like,
I've looked up and I've seen,
you know,

1993
01:59:09.731 --> 01:59:14.260
that you can charter these yachts,
these super yachts,
mega yachts for hundred,

1994
01:59:14.261 --> 01:59:16.750
200,
300,000.
It's crazy money.

1995
01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:20.830
What is the industry standard for tipping?
Is it a percentage of that?

1996
01:59:20.831 --> 01:59:23.830
It's 20% it's 20% fuck in a

1997
01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:30.790
day's work.
So that's how I made all the money in December 13th.

1998
01:59:30.791 --> 01:59:34.240
So let's say the boat,
uh,
it was $150,000 for the week,

1999
01:59:34.241 --> 01:59:35.920
and that doesn't include fuel food.

2000
01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:41.440
They're going to spend $200,000 minimum for their seven day vacation.

2001
01:59:41.470 --> 01:59:44.620
But also they give something called an Apa and advanced provision allowance

2002
01:59:44.860 --> 01:59:49.780
where they send us thousands of thousands of dollars to shop for other champagne

2003
01:59:49.781 --> 01:59:51.880
and lobster and oysters and all their food.

2004
01:59:52.210 --> 01:59:55.120
And a lot of times we don't use all of that money.

2005
01:59:55.240 --> 01:59:58.330
So what they'll do is they'll Tibet's 20% on $150,000,

2006
01:59:58.450 --> 02:00:01.160
which is $30,000 divided by 10 crew.

2007
02:00:01.161 --> 02:00:02.740
So you've got three grand there and then they'll say,

2008
02:00:02.741 --> 02:00:05.470
and you can have the rest of the APA,
so you'll make,
yeah.

2009
02:00:05.471 --> 02:00:09.100
So we'll just figure it out.
They're like,
well,
yeah.
So,
uh,
because,

2010
02:00:09.130 --> 02:00:12.510
because after seven days of the best service on the planet,

2011
02:00:12.540 --> 02:00:16.420
they are just so blissed out of their mind.
They're like,
take it all.
We don't.

2012
02:00:16.421 --> 02:00:17.140
We thank you.
Oh,

2013
02:00:17.140 --> 02:00:20.770
because seven days is a long time to be on a boat with these charter guests.

2014
02:00:21.130 --> 02:00:25.180
And by the end of it,
your friends is seven days.
The typical length,

2015
02:00:25.181 --> 02:00:29.140
seven days is the minimum.
Um,
I've had charters that stayed on board for a month.

2016
02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:34.150
No.
Yeah,
I didn't say God damn fortune.
Yes,
there they were rushing this group.

2017
02:00:34.151 --> 02:00:38.050
But,
um,
a lot of the Russians,
how have the big yeah and the middle end.

2018
02:00:38.051 --> 02:00:42.520
Any Middle Eastern I there are but they have the biggest,
biggest,
biggest boats.

2019
02:00:42.521 --> 02:00:44.560
Like they almost like compete with each other.

2020
02:00:44.561 --> 02:00:46.720
There are these two sheikhs who were like competing.

2021
02:00:46.721 --> 02:00:49.660
They don't tell a how big their building their yacht cause they don't want them

2022
02:00:49.661 --> 02:00:50.590
to like outdo them.

2023
02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:53.590
And then there was one sheikh who like had finally built the biggest yacht.

2024
02:00:53.591 --> 02:00:56.980
He stepped foot on it for the first time and he's like I feel too far away from

2025
02:00:56.981 --> 02:00:57.850
the ocean,
sell it.

2026
02:00:58.060 --> 02:01:02.230
Like they just have stupid money but that size boat I don't like working on,

2027
02:01:02.231 --> 02:01:05.980
I don't like working on anything over than 200 feet cause then we're getting

2028
02:01:05.981 --> 02:01:10.720
into like small cruise ship and it's just,
it's just nuts.
The ideal.

2029
02:01:10.721 --> 02:01:11.680
What's the best size?

2030
02:01:11.740 --> 02:01:16.630
I love a 180 which is 60 meters and that is usually around 14 crew.

2031
02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:20.380
It's big enough where you don't get sick of your crew members.

2032
02:01:20.381 --> 02:01:22.390
There's enough people personalities to bounce off of,

2033
02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:26.650
but it's not so many that you feel like you're just a cog in a wheel.

2034
02:01:26.651 --> 02:01:27.011
It feels like.

2035
02:01:27.011 --> 02:01:31.930
So like a family and it's big enough to for the guests to feel like there's

2036
02:01:32.170 --> 02:01:36.370
plenty of rooms to go to and it's just you're going to get hired tip money cause

2037
02:01:36.371 --> 02:01:38.110
it's going to cost more.
The bigger the boat.

2038
02:01:38.111 --> 02:01:41.330
So one eighties the real sweet spot and that's what happens to be the size of

2039
02:01:41.331 --> 02:01:45.050
the boat that we used on this season of below deck and Tahiti and cry or she

2040
02:01:45.060 --> 02:01:47.630
isn't even using like one fifties which is also a great size,

2041
02:01:47.810 --> 02:01:50.750
but then you go to 60 meters and that's kind of like perfect.

2042
02:01:50.780 --> 02:01:54.170
Which brings me to the next question perfectly.
A lot of the previous seasons,

2043
02:01:54.171 --> 02:01:56.210
and I think most of the time like I'm from Florida,

2044
02:01:56.211 --> 02:01:58.550
so you're just exposed to the Caribbean.

2045
02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:02.630
Huge difference between working in the Caribbean and Tahiti.

2046
02:02:02.780 --> 02:02:06.170
Honestly not so much on the boat,
especially for me.
Like,
oh look,

2047
02:02:06.171 --> 02:02:08.090
another palm tree out the porthole.
Yeah.
You know,

2048
02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:12.650
but the only difference really is the language barrier because I don't speak

2049
02:02:12.651 --> 02:02:15.890
French,
Polynesian or French at all.
I would like to,
but um,

2050
02:02:16.010 --> 02:02:19.220
it was a lovely change cause I've done the Caribbean so many times that this was

2051
02:02:19.221 --> 02:02:22.100
at least new,
a new location and made it exciting for me.

2052
02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:25.790
But at the end of the day,
if you're not getting off the boat,

2053
02:02:25.791 --> 02:02:29.540
you're not truly experiencing the places that you're going as much.

2054
02:02:29.541 --> 02:02:32.240
Like a lot of Yachty's worked for bragging rights,
but that's all bs.

2055
02:02:32.241 --> 02:02:35.150
Like they're like sending photos home to mom and their friends on Facebook.

2056
02:02:35.150 --> 02:02:38.840
I look,
oh just in Cannes and Capri and yeah,

2057
02:02:38.930 --> 02:02:43.610
when really it should be like day 47 everyday.
A truck struggle,
like,

2058
02:02:43.611 --> 02:02:46.370
you know,
so let me ask you one,

2059
02:02:46.430 --> 02:02:48.680
I love the preference sheet meeting.

2060
02:02:48.710 --> 02:02:53.260
So captain Lee's sits down with Kate and who else?
The boson and the chef.
Yes.

2061
02:02:53.630 --> 02:02:57.890
And comes the preference sheet,
which is a photograph of the,
the primary,

2062
02:02:57.980 --> 02:03:02.810
which is like the lead guest.
It's his,
her hair party.

2063
02:03:03.270 --> 02:03:06.710
Crazy friends to bring.
Yeah.
Are they paid the most?

2064
02:03:06.711 --> 02:03:11.090
They get the biggest room that,
oh,
is that right?
Okay.
I have no idea.

2065
02:03:11.091 --> 02:03:14.420
It was this banana.
So,
and then there's a list of like things they like,

2066
02:03:14.421 --> 02:03:15.840
things they don't like.
Um,

2067
02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:18.290
and there've been guests who were southern and we're like,

2068
02:03:18.291 --> 02:03:22.880
we don't lack vegetables or fruits.
And Chef Ben was like,
are you being serious?

2069
02:03:22.881 --> 02:03:27.570
Like horrified.
Right.

2070
02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:29.473
Chicken fingers.

2071
02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:34.580
It's just such a funny contrast to have that chef cause he's so posh.

2072
02:03:34.581 --> 02:03:39.410
You know that guests like we miss chef man is hilarious.

2073
02:03:39.590 --> 02:03:41.840
He's,
he's a genius.
His Dad actually wrote that book,

2074
02:03:42.140 --> 02:03:46.610
Lone survivor that was made into a movie.
So what fun fact.
Yeah.

2075
02:03:46.611 --> 02:03:50.270
He's his dad's in New York Times bestseller with a lot of military books.

2076
02:03:51.700 --> 02:03:56.150
Yeah.
Um,
so Ben Ha grew up a very posh and,

2077
02:03:56.210 --> 02:04:00.180
but he is a genius and he's self made after he left home.
I'm like,
he's so,

2078
02:04:00.590 --> 02:04:01.730
such a good chef.

2079
02:04:04.110 --> 02:04:07.790
We basically watched the show.
It's entertaining,
it's traumatic.

2080
02:04:07.850 --> 02:04:11.330
And then what it is is you,
you go into fantasy land of like,

2081
02:04:11.331 --> 02:04:16.250
here's what I would do.
And then we plan out.

2082
02:04:17.410 --> 02:04:22.340
Then like we're always like,
oh yeah,
whatever you want,
fucking blow our minds.

2083
02:04:22.341 --> 02:04:24.230
Let's have four.
Cause we like restaurants.

2084
02:04:26.620 --> 02:04:29.760
You got fries.
And he was like,
I can make some fries.

2085
02:04:30.140 --> 02:04:33.660
Can I get some grilled cheeses,
cheeses.
And I kind of get it cause I do love it.

2086
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:36.820
But you never think of it.
Both one orders,

2087
02:04:36.830 --> 02:04:37.980
grilled cheese and then he's kind to make

2088
02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.220
<v 2>10 marks.
That's a good idea.
And that's when it really starts sending them off.</v>

2089
02:04:41.940 --> 02:04:44.590
I mean I get just a grilled cheese after you've been drinking too.

2090
02:04:44.591 --> 02:04:49.540
It's like that's the thing
now.
But uh,
okay.
So here's Tom,

2091
02:04:49.590 --> 02:04:53.760
here's what we're going to do on our charter.
Let's make it happen.
Oh my God,

2092
02:04:53.761 --> 02:04:54.600
we've already come on,

2093
02:04:58.470 --> 02:05:02.700
here's what worked.
Here's what we're not going to do any kind of themed night,

2094
02:05:02.760 --> 02:05:05.250
no parties.
You know what?
I respect that and that.

2095
02:05:05.310 --> 02:05:07.110
Not that you guys are elegant because it's like,

2096
02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:12.120
here's an idea for a theme party.
A yacht vacation is not good enough.

2097
02:05:12.630 --> 02:05:16.800
It makes me well bonkers because he don't do that shit for people that don't

2098
02:05:16.801 --> 02:05:21.000
know what happens is a lot of times people come on and then they'll give their

2099
02:05:21.001 --> 02:05:24.810
food preferences and we want to have a beach picnic.
And by the way,

2100
02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:29.790
we'd love for one night to be,
uh,
to be like a frat party night.

2101
02:05:29.800 --> 02:05:34.800
One toe goes,
oh,
okay.
And then it will be like,
you know,

2102
02:05:34.801 --> 02:05:39.240
we have a,
it's an all white party.
So random.

2103
02:05:39.260 --> 02:05:40.430
I think sometimes it's like,
well,

2104
02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:44.880
on a blue and white party with a fiesta sub theme.
I'm like,
what is this?

2105
02:05:44.970 --> 02:05:48.870
What is this?
I think on regular charters were there for seven days.

2106
02:05:49.050 --> 02:05:52.080
The guests can get a little bit bored.
So towards the end of it you'll be like,

2107
02:05:52.470 --> 02:05:53.890
okay,
it's casino night,

2108
02:05:54.050 --> 02:05:58.050
Gary Monaco like pirate night because you're on the ocean.

2109
02:05:58.380 --> 02:06:02.910
But other than that,
the theme parties or like Gilding the lily.

2110
02:06:03.530 --> 02:06:04.363
Sure.

2111
02:06:05.820 --> 02:06:08.190
Almost holding you back from having the best experience because now we've got to

2112
02:06:08.191 --> 02:06:12.000
serve your tacos because you wanted a fiesta.
I totally agree.
I liked.
I mean,

2113
02:06:12.001 --> 02:06:16.350
I want it to be,
I want to chill hard,
great food all the time.

2114
02:06:17.120 --> 02:06:21.090
Maybe do massage,
you know,

2115
02:06:21.390 --> 02:06:24.990
I could see like,
oh,
I've been laying around.
If there's a gym on board,

2116
02:06:24.991 --> 02:06:29.640
I'll do a little workout read.
Yeah,
watch a movie.

2117
02:06:29.641 --> 02:06:32.840
I don't know,
just,
I like to relax.
You sound like the ideal charter I guess.

2118
02:06:32.850 --> 02:06:34.410
And that's,
you've got great taste.

2119
02:06:34.411 --> 02:06:38.010
Now I do want to know what you want to do a beach party cause I don't really

2120
02:06:38.011 --> 02:06:39.290
understand why not.

2121
02:06:39.330 --> 02:06:44.140
I do hate doing them because it's so much training for iron man,

2122
02:06:44.250 --> 02:06:48.900
like dragging these heavy to tell people what that means.
So what happens is the,

2123
02:06:48.901 --> 02:06:53.070
the yacht is anchored.
You can't pull a huge yacht up to the shore.

2124
02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:54.750
So what happens is the guest goes,

2125
02:06:54.751 --> 02:06:57.960
we want to go over to that beach that we see over there and eat lunch on that

2126
02:06:57.961 --> 02:07:00.780
beach.
You have to prepare everything.

2127
02:07:00.781 --> 02:07:05.370
Two hours to transport on tenders.
The food that the tent,
the tables,

2128
02:07:05.371 --> 02:07:09.960
the chairs,
salt and pepper butters,
bug spray,
toilet paper,
forks and Napkins,

2129
02:07:10.070 --> 02:07:14.160
condom mitts.
Uh,
ice that melts in the Orient.
We usually in a very hot location,

2130
02:07:14.161 --> 02:07:17.940
I've got bring bags.
It's just such a thing.
It never looks cool.

2131
02:07:18.060 --> 02:07:21.040
I don't even like outdoor eating me either.
Uh,
every,
every restaurant that go.

2132
02:07:21.041 --> 02:07:22.230
Do you like indirect indoors?

2133
02:07:22.710 --> 02:07:25.380
You have a luxury yacht but you want to go eat in Sanoe.

2134
02:07:25.500 --> 02:07:28.050
Why do you want like I could see saying,
hey,

2135
02:07:28.051 --> 02:07:30.540
can we take the tender over to the beach and hang out?

2136
02:07:30.630 --> 02:07:33.090
Then we'll come back for lunch.
Eat on board.
See,

2137
02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:36.060
I just don't understand why they didn't want to the beach picnic.
Uh,

2138
02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:38.880
I would like to keep the sand away from my food.
Absolutely.
Yeah.

2139
02:07:38.890 --> 02:07:41.600
I think it's gross and I don't like,
I mean,
I don't know.

2140
02:07:41.720 --> 02:07:46.690
I just picture it just flies and it's hard.
People are sweating.
It's just weird.

2141
02:07:46.691 --> 02:07:47.820
I don't like it at all.
You know?

2142
02:07:47.950 --> 02:07:52.950
Is it true that whenever you anchor and you know it's like it's day three,

2143
02:07:53.350 --> 02:07:58.300
should the deck crew have all the toys out immediately?
Yes.

2144
02:07:58.450 --> 02:08:02.590
Really?
Yes.
Actually I
feel like we have to keep informing people.

2145
02:08:02.920 --> 02:08:06.010
So tell what that means.
I've got an interior crew.

2146
02:08:06.020 --> 02:08:08.730
The tech crew handles like all the Washington,

2147
02:08:08.740 --> 02:08:10.750
the boat and the toys for the charter gas,

2148
02:08:10.751 --> 02:08:15.370
which will usually be about two jet skis and a trampoline that floats.

2149
02:08:17.320 --> 02:08:21.800
They've got so many random,
he just fell off as all tries to close.
Okay.

2150
02:08:22.810 --> 02:08:27.240
I talked to him.
You talked to him.
He's like,
okay,
I'm okay.

2151
02:08:27.860 --> 02:08:32.740
He's fine.
He doesn't have a bump raining.
Um,
no.
He's talking about toys.

2152
02:08:34.450 --> 02:08:37.860
The toys icicle yet we don't,

2153
02:08:39.700 --> 02:08:41.860
I mean the toys look fun,
but it's also,

2154
02:08:41.861 --> 02:08:43.720
here's the bummer since again for you guys,

2155
02:08:43.721 --> 02:08:47.140
but I guess it's part of the price is a lot of times I imagine this set

2156
02:08:47.141 --> 02:08:50.290
everything up and people are like,
I just feel like laying down,
right?

2157
02:08:50.290 --> 02:08:53.680
Like I don't really want to use it.
They are paying so much money.

2158
02:08:54.460 --> 02:08:57.320
If everything is in the garage,
they're never going to use that.

2159
02:08:57.350 --> 02:09:01.240
We shouldn't make the guests feel like we're their birding us and everything

2160
02:09:01.241 --> 02:09:02.140
should look effortless.

2161
02:09:02.141 --> 02:09:05.050
Like the jet skis are there if you want them or if you don't,

2162
02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:09.270
it shouldn't be like them asking,
do you think you don't mind?
You know,

2163
02:09:09.430 --> 02:09:11.350
getting the jet skis out.
That's right.

2164
02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:16.140
That's why every time we dropped the anchor,
put it all out and make money.
Yeah.

2165
02:09:16.900 --> 02:09:19.990
I don't know if I do the toys.
We were just talking when you're in there.

2166
02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:24.920
I don't want a beach picnic.
No Way.
Never.
Why?
Yeah.

2167
02:09:25.630 --> 02:09:28.770
I'm a goddamn boat bathing suit.

2168
02:09:28.780 --> 02:09:33.510
Sunbae drink champagne to even discuss this stuff.
That's the fun thing.
I know.

2169
02:09:33.511 --> 02:09:36.970
I love it.
It's wild.
Here's what,
here's what I wouldn't do either.

2170
02:09:37.060 --> 02:09:40.600
I'm not dressing up fancy dress.
You guys are so cute.

2171
02:09:40.601 --> 02:09:44.260
You have the same preferences.
Uh,
yeah.
Yeah.
It's my yacht.

2172
02:09:44.290 --> 02:09:47.170
I'm going to come up in my pajamas and you guys are going to make me an amazing

2173
02:09:47.171 --> 02:09:51.080
meal and I'm going to go lay down again.
Please.

2174
02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:56.770
No,
we need a little more scratch.
God dammit.
No.
Maybe.

2175
02:09:56.771 --> 02:09:58.750
How old are we?
Maybe in 10 years,

2176
02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:03.760
maybe in 10 years we'll do it and not send,
what's his name?

2177
02:10:03.761 --> 02:10:06.180
The college doesn't need to go to school.
Right.
So,

2178
02:10:06.181 --> 02:10:09.880
so what Yachty weirdest thing you've seen on a preference sheet.

2179
02:10:10.290 --> 02:10:13.550
That was some bitch that I think on below Deck Med ed white gumballs.

2180
02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:17.740
And that was ridiculous.
I'm embarrassed for you lady.
Yeah.

2181
02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:20.710
Yeah.
I mean,
how do you have friends?

2182
02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:24.460
If you met somebody in real life that like white gumballs,
you'd be like,
oh look,

2183
02:10:24.461 --> 02:10:28.480
here comes some crazy white gumball girl.
Did anybody ask why white

2184
02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:34.010
five?
Like you shouldn't be eating that shit.
What was it?
Was

2185
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:38.360
<v 7>it this season two was so gross?
Cucumber,
ovaries.
What?</v>

2186
02:10:38.740 --> 02:10:41.370
The Timothy Sykes Penny stock trader gun.
Yeah,

2187
02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:44.960
that one had like molecular just verification,
which I get is cool.

2188
02:10:44.961 --> 02:10:49.430
Like it's Mary Thomas Keller.
Um,
a little difficult on a yacht,
but okay.

2189
02:10:49.940 --> 02:10:52.850
Uh,
you want a cucumber over?
He said,
I've never heard of that and I can't.
Yeah,

2190
02:10:52.980 --> 02:10:57.170
that doesn't sound like you'd be a good texture.
No cucumber over

2191
02:10:58.790 --> 02:11:02.700
there was the guy who had that little dime piece with him.

2192
02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:06.350
Blondie,
could you go ahead?

2193
02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:10.280
And she was like super rude and snappy.
Do remember he's an older guy,

2194
02:11:10.350 --> 02:11:12.560
was this last season and she was like,
Hey,
f a f.

2195
02:11:16.050 --> 02:11:17.450
I mean,
and then also it's like,

2196
02:11:17.451 --> 02:11:22.010
it's always great when a man has to tell his lady of any age.

2197
02:11:22.030 --> 02:11:26.570
He'd dial it back down,
calm down.
What are you talk?
Is this your daughter?

2198
02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:30.050
I'm not sure you guys are going to last the long haul.
You know?
Know

2199
02:11:31.670 --> 02:11:33.350
how unattractive she becomes.

2200
02:11:33.351 --> 02:11:35.590
Like she's this beautiful girl started out right away.

2201
02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:41.270
When she left she was like negative 10 that's so sad.

2202
02:11:41.271 --> 02:11:45.380
It makes people so ugly.
It was the hottest.
People are gross.
I don't like,

2203
02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:49.270
she was rude to,
I don't care if it's the parking attendant,

2204
02:11:50.090 --> 02:11:53.000
fucking captain,
whoever it is like,
dude,
don't be like that.

2205
02:11:53.001 --> 02:11:56.660
Don't be shitty to people.
So,
okay,
so cucumber,
ovaries,
and then what?

2206
02:11:56.690 --> 02:12:01.100
I know I don't like the foam party guy.
That's disgusting.
Yeah.

2207
02:12:01.101 --> 02:12:05.890
He had so many requests and he invited us all out to his mansion in Acapulco and

2208
02:12:06.470 --> 02:12:08.540
I wouldn't mind going to a mansion in Acapulco.

2209
02:12:08.770 --> 02:12:11.000
Then I went to air force like $1,000 and I was like,

2210
02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:15.950
I'm not paying $1,000 to go goes.
Yeah.

2211
02:12:16.340 --> 02:12:18.080
And what is the deal with the film party?

2212
02:12:19.490 --> 02:12:23.030
He just hammered all day,
all day.

2213
02:12:23.060 --> 02:12:27.140
So hammered and hammered he dumb fucking jacket and hat,

2214
02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:32.200
like trying to be like,
I'm that guy,
look at me.
Okay Steve at,

2215
02:12:32.201 --> 02:12:35.990
Gosh,
it was just so exhausting and I'm surprised he likes him.

2216
02:12:36.140 --> 02:12:37.640
Lee likes going to acapulco

2217
02:12:40.530 --> 02:12:44.300
and Captain Leah has gone out there with them a few times and apparently he's

2218
02:12:44.301 --> 02:12:47.080
not at all like that when he's in his own home.
You know,

2219
02:12:47.180 --> 02:12:50.210
I think he's just trying to make the most of is two days,
three days on the boat.

2220
02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:54.320
Um,
but I blame captain leaf for him coming back this season and being like

2221
02:12:54.321 --> 02:12:57.740
emboldened because now he was like,
I'm friends with Lee.

2222
02:12:57.741 --> 02:12:59.150
I can act however I want,

2223
02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:01.400
but at least up in the wheelhouse and I had to deal with,
I'm like,

2224
02:13:01.401 --> 02:13:03.770
I didn't go to Acapulco.
You can handle your friend.

2225
02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:07.190
He's such an archetype.

2226
02:13:07.191 --> 02:13:11.300
Stereotypical what a boat captains should be.
What's his,
what's his history?

2227
02:13:12.110 --> 02:13:16.970
How do you become a big,
he actually got into it late in the game I think.
Yeah,

2228
02:13:16.971 --> 02:13:21.370
he's kind of a real colorful past like he was working in the steel field mines

2229
02:13:21.380 --> 02:13:23.260
or something really north and then see that.

2230
02:13:23.420 --> 02:13:25.850
Then like him and his wife were like,
you know,
let's go out of the rat race.

2231
02:13:25.851 --> 02:13:30.851
And they went to run a restaurant and like the virgin islands like just picked

2232
02:13:31.531 --> 02:13:33.540
up everything went down there,
let's hope it works out.

2233
02:13:33.750 --> 02:13:35.100
Didn't really work out that well.

2234
02:13:35.101 --> 02:13:37.620
So he started just working on boats because they were in the Caribbean and then

2235
02:13:37.621 --> 02:13:38.490
one thing led to another.

2236
02:13:38.491 --> 02:13:42.930
He realized there was good money but you didn't start till was like 35 employee.

2237
02:13:43.830 --> 02:13:45.870
Absolutely trust that guy.
Like I would,

2238
02:13:45.900 --> 02:13:49.530
I feel comfortable and Captain Sandy I like,

2239
02:13:49.620 --> 02:13:52.470
I like me some Campton San I take her to,
she's very nice.

2240
02:13:52.471 --> 02:13:54.990
She's very nice and I love her.
No,

2241
02:13:54.991 --> 02:13:58.400
but she stopped by my hometown and I took her out to dinner and I just say meet

2242
02:13:58.410 --> 02:14:01.200
and compare notes and she was lovely.

2243
02:14:01.201 --> 02:14:05.880
I just love also how opposite Captain Sandy and Katherine Leon for below Deck

2244
02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:09.030
Mad.
It would have been difficult for any male captain to come in and even,

2245
02:14:09.330 --> 02:14:10.163
you know,

2246
02:14:10.980 --> 02:14:14.430
compare to captain late cause he studied the seas gold jewelry.

2247
02:14:14.431 --> 02:14:19.230
He looks like the training from the jewelry.
I know,
I love it.

2248
02:14:19.231 --> 02:14:23.640
So much.
Jeans Bracelet.
I mean it's so much gold.

2249
02:14:24.340 --> 02:14:29.040
So real Florida,
Florida man.
That's what I'm saying.

2250
02:14:29.041 --> 02:14:31.620
He's such as archetypes.
Show me,

2251
02:14:32.270 --> 02:14:35.280
show me a picture of him with that on.
I'd be like immediate.

2252
02:14:35.281 --> 02:14:37.590
That'd be like the keys like that guy lives in Kuwait.
Yeah,

2253
02:14:38.060 --> 02:14:40.410
that's definitely south Florida.
There is an aesthetic.

2254
02:14:40.411 --> 02:14:43.950
The Floridians definitely know.
You know what I like about captain lead to his,

2255
02:14:43.951 --> 02:14:48.780
his dread of dining with the guests that always,
I'm like I totally get it.

2256
02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:50.073
Fuck,

2257
02:14:51.140 --> 02:14:55.710
but they pay so much and I secretly enjoy it because the bulk of the time he

2258
02:14:55.711 --> 02:14:58.230
gets to hide up in the wheelhouse while I'm stuck with all these Yahoos.

2259
02:14:58.650 --> 02:15:01.860
So I'm like here you go captain late like loving it.

2260
02:15:02.130 --> 02:15:05.520
I got another specific question cause we went back to season two because we were

2261
02:15:05.521 --> 02:15:09.420
so excited about this was it was Andrew,
that was his name.

2262
02:15:09.421 --> 02:15:14.070
I think Sandra God,
was he putting us on like was he's just trying to get on TV?

2263
02:15:14.610 --> 02:15:19.260
I mean,
yes,
I think so.
But also I don't think he's the brightest.
Oh really?

2264
02:15:19.710 --> 02:15:22.190
Okay.
In case you didn't notice.
I mean a lot,

2265
02:15:22.380 --> 02:15:25.290
that's what's difficult about the job.
A lot of people want to be on TV,

2266
02:15:25.291 --> 02:15:26.940
but this is a safety thing.

2267
02:15:27.060 --> 02:15:31.950
We need trained Yachty's because he seemed like he was like,
I'm smiling a lot.

2268
02:15:31.951 --> 02:15:35.100
That's cool.
Right?
I'm like,
what are you,
what are you doing?
He thought,

2269
02:15:35.101 --> 02:15:37.680
I think he thought he could get away with it.
But if you don't know,

2270
02:15:37.681 --> 02:15:39.450
if they've never worked on a yacht,
you're like,
how hard can it be?

2271
02:15:39.451 --> 02:15:43.490
Like I was on my first shot,
but I wouldn't want to try that on TV.
You know,
new.

2272
02:15:43.980 --> 02:15:45.630
That's going to be embarrassing.
It's probably not gonna end well.

2273
02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:48.350
Ask all the green people throughout the seasons.
You know,

2274
02:15:49.230 --> 02:15:50.670
I almost feel like when we went back to it,

2275
02:15:50.671 --> 02:15:53.640
cause I actually at first I started watching,
I was like man,

2276
02:15:53.641 --> 02:15:57.900
cause you know it's been a few years and I was like,
oh wait,
I saw this season,

2277
02:15:57.901 --> 02:16:01.290
I thought I'd forgotten so much.
But then when I saw the,
the rocket ship,

2278
02:16:01.890 --> 02:16:06.750
that's the best episode of the first big moment of the show.
You guys,

2279
02:16:06.751 --> 02:16:07.230
I don't know,

2280
02:16:07.230 --> 02:16:10.500
it was like I don't put it in planet because he really didn't play this at all.

2281
02:16:10.501 --> 02:16:13.470
I've never done anything like that in my life.
I've never made a rocket ship.

2282
02:16:14.430 --> 02:16:17.220
And I always tell people though listening,
what happens.
Okay.

2283
02:16:17.230 --> 02:16:21.030
So it's like there's a guest on board and there's only like our second charter

2284
02:16:21.031 --> 02:16:22.710
or something.
So it's only been a week on this boat.

2285
02:16:22.711 --> 02:16:24.390
I don't really know people that don't know me that well,

2286
02:16:24.391 --> 02:16:27.990
like my crew and I'm just doing as good a job as I can.

2287
02:16:27.991 --> 02:16:29.810
I'm concentrating and this yes,

2288
02:16:29.830 --> 02:16:33.760
as I look bitchy and that they would like me to make some drinks and to be told,

2289
02:16:33.910 --> 02:16:38.110
you look bitchy and then to make drinks.
And then forced to smile is just,

2290
02:16:38.770 --> 02:16:40.510
it was shocking.
And,
uh,

2291
02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:44.210
I only cry when I'm frustrated and I was so frustrated because as we can

2292
02:16:44.211 --> 02:16:48.940
humiliated and then told to work,
so I was like,
I'm on TV,
I'm not going to cry.

2293
02:16:48.941 --> 02:16:51.460
I'm going to get through this.
So I make the shots,
I bring them out.

2294
02:16:51.670 --> 02:16:53.680
I may get there a whole dinner service that night.

2295
02:16:53.800 --> 02:16:56.320
I go to bed that night thinking,
good job Kate,

2296
02:16:56.321 --> 02:16:58.090
you didn't let the man get you down.

2297
02:16:59.050 --> 02:17:03.280
Then the next morning I go to check the turndowns and I just plan on making an

2298
02:17:03.281 --> 02:17:06.880
anchor like I usually do so that people know what what you're saying though,

2299
02:17:06.900 --> 02:17:09.400
it's that there's guests,
they're out of the room.

2300
02:17:09.700 --> 02:17:13.090
So now they're having breakfast and you do things with the towels,

2301
02:17:14.830 --> 02:17:15.670
finishing touches.

2302
02:17:15.970 --> 02:17:19.690
So I usually make an anchor out of the throw blanket on the bed and while I'm in

2303
02:17:19.691 --> 02:17:20.530
there,
you know,

2304
02:17:20.620 --> 02:17:25.540
I like a creative payback and the rage was still inside me and hadn't been

2305
02:17:25.541 --> 02:17:26.374
addressed.

2306
02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:30.940
So I was like creative outlet and I thought a middle finger was my first idea.

2307
02:17:30.970 --> 02:17:33.100
But I,
that sounds complicated.
I don't know how to do that.

2308
02:17:33.101 --> 02:17:36.460
I don't know how to translate.
Well,
I have a towel.

2309
02:17:37.590 --> 02:17:41.470
It's not the right medium.
So in fun fact,
a rocket ship,

2310
02:17:41.620 --> 02:17:43.930
a Phallic rocket ship,
it's not that far off from an anchor.

2311
02:17:44.230 --> 02:17:47.350
You just put the top together and went to fluff up the bottom.

2312
02:17:47.680 --> 02:17:51.670
And so I made it and,
but he was,
there is no cameras,
no nothing.

2313
02:17:51.940 --> 02:17:53.800
And I was just playing around.
I wasn't really planning on keeping it,

2314
02:17:53.801 --> 02:17:58.180
but when I saw it I was like,
oh that's really good.
I just like,
well he was rude.

2315
02:17:58.181 --> 02:18:02.080
So I left and then people saw it and freaked out.
I thought they would laugh.

2316
02:18:02.170 --> 02:18:06.160
They were not laughing.
That guests really was not laughing.
No one was laughing.

2317
02:18:06.190 --> 02:18:09.510
What did we,
the deck,
the,
my crew thought that we weren't going,

2318
02:18:09.511 --> 02:18:12.990
it tipped cause it was pretty disrespectful I guess.
But uh,
no.

2319
02:18:14.430 --> 02:18:18.970
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
It looks like a big penis.
Has he had acted like a dick to me.

2320
02:18:19.820 --> 02:18:23.650
He's gay.
That's what I'm just going to say.
He is a gay man.
So

2321
02:18:25.180 --> 02:18:28.390
you're providing service things,
more things.

2322
02:18:28.391 --> 02:18:32.730
Do you like reference sheets?
Does a theme party and so like,

2323
02:18:36.820 --> 02:18:38.110
oh,
of course.
Fabulous.
Yeah.

2324
02:18:38.590 --> 02:18:42.850
So they wanted to fire me like really did until now it's week one.
I'm like,

2325
02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:47.200
oh my God,
what have I done?
I have just made a huge dick on a bed on national TV.

2326
02:18:47.201 --> 02:18:51.680
My mother,
my the way for the first time working with Lee.
Yeah.

2327
02:18:52.150 --> 02:18:56.680
So he's like,
yeah,
I thought they would like it cause you know,

2328
02:18:56.681 --> 02:18:59.770
for ratings,
whatever,
they did not like it.
Everyone didn't like it.
No,

2329
02:18:59.980 --> 02:19:03.410
no one likes.
It didn't as I remember,
cause we didn't get the,
uh,

2330
02:19:03.580 --> 02:19:06.820
through the whole thing on season two is,
but in my memory,

2331
02:19:06.821 --> 02:19:10.090
didn't he eventually go like he loved and then he came back,

2332
02:19:10.091 --> 02:19:13.510
he came back around and now I visited him in Scottsdale.
Yeah,
we're fine.

2333
02:19:13.570 --> 02:19:15.600
He finally got it.
But uh,
it,

2334
02:19:15.670 --> 02:19:18.790
it was a real scary couple of hours in a day.

2335
02:19:20.490 --> 02:19:23.290
I thought I had just ended my career on national television.

2336
02:19:23.291 --> 02:19:28.280
Embarrassed my family be a plane ticket.
I did.
Yeah.
But,

2337
02:19:28.290 --> 02:19:31.730
uh,
it turns out not so much.
Oh,
may I ask you and I,

2338
02:19:31.890 --> 02:19:36.770
it's like a production question to the the plane ticket and the envelope.

2339
02:19:36.980 --> 02:19:40.430
Real stuff or production stuff.
Yeah.
Well I don't think,

2340
02:19:40.610 --> 02:19:43.190
I don't think they actually get the printout boarding pass.
Oh No,
no,

2341
02:19:43.191 --> 02:19:47.930
but is that a practice?
I'm saying no,
I've never gotten one.
Um,
from captain lead,

2342
02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:52.370
like I don't know what's actually in that envelope but being fired.
Yeah.

2343
02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:56.600
I've been fired a few times on yachts and she discusses it in her book.
Lucky.

2344
02:19:56.601 --> 02:20:00.860
Charming.
Yes.
Okay.
Chestain available according to my resume.
Thank you.

2345
02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:03.800
According to my resume,
I don't put that I was fired.

2346
02:20:03.801 --> 02:20:06.800
I just say that boat was sold because if they sell a boat,

2347
02:20:06.830 --> 02:20:09.800
the crew has gets a payout and you go to find another boat.

2348
02:20:10.340 --> 02:20:13.760
So I've haven't been fired,
but I have been on about three boats that sold.

2349
02:20:15.380 --> 02:20:17.310
What was your,
um,
you know,

2350
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:20.780
what was the reason that they were asking you to leave on a yacht?

2351
02:20:20.781 --> 02:20:23.770
You can fire people for any reason,
even if they just don't like you because,

2352
02:20:24.200 --> 02:20:27.230
oh yeah.
It's like showbiz captain.
Oh yeah.
Make your shot.

2353
02:20:27.231 --> 02:20:30.140
Didn't like me and I don't really blame them because I wasn't used to working

2354
02:20:30.141 --> 02:20:32.930
hard.
Like I'd be down the line drawing,
painting my fingernails,

2355
02:20:32.931 --> 02:20:35.450
like I just did not get it.
And um,

2356
02:20:36.110 --> 02:20:38.300
when you have such tight living quarters,

2357
02:20:38.360 --> 02:20:41.840
like one person that doesn't get it can throw it all off and they're just like,

2358
02:20:41.900 --> 02:20:45.320
you go figure it out and when they fire you,
it's aggressive.

2359
02:20:45.321 --> 02:20:47.000
Cause usually when you get fired from a real job,
you're not,

2360
02:20:47.001 --> 02:20:50.310
you're unemployed but you're not also homeless,
so,
right.

2361
02:20:50.700 --> 02:20:51.830
You get fired from a yacht.

2362
02:20:52.130 --> 02:20:54.830
You could be in a foreign country and now you're unemployed and you're like,

2363
02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:58.060
now what?
Yeah,

2364
02:20:58.070 --> 02:21:00.320
that's what she writes about in his book is that they didn't,

2365
02:21:00.321 --> 02:21:03.290
they dock you somewhere horrendous.
Freeport Bahamas,

2366
02:21:03.291 --> 02:21:04.850
which just looks like Satan ship yard.

2367
02:21:05.060 --> 02:21:08.250
I'm pretty sure you shouldn't get off the boat without a tetanus shot.
Um,

2368
02:21:08.450 --> 02:21:11.840
and that's where the hard hat,
and I'm like,
finally,
after a month of work,

2369
02:21:11.841 --> 02:21:15.020
I'm like,
Ooh,
a day off in Bahamas.
And they're like,
ah,
you're fired.

2370
02:21:15.021 --> 02:21:19.520
You have one hour to pack in the capital been here.
And it's just like,
Holy Shit.

2371
02:21:19.860 --> 02:21:23.660
Yeah.
I had a question from all of these,
uh,
charges you've been on.

2372
02:21:24.050 --> 02:21:25.880
Has it chef ever been sick?

2373
02:21:27.740 --> 02:21:31.920
I've had chefs not be sick but lose their mind because all chefs are insane.

2374
02:21:31.921 --> 02:21:33.890
Yeah.
And they are,
they just are.

2375
02:21:34.460 --> 02:21:39.020
It's like to work in that heated environment and creative and they have to like

2376
02:21:39.021 --> 02:21:40.100
that rush.
You have to be little nuts.

2377
02:21:40.310 --> 02:21:44.080
So I did have a chef that were anchored off Saint Barts with owners on board and

2378
02:21:44.090 --> 02:21:45.800
he went to get provisions,

2379
02:21:46.070 --> 02:21:49.370
but he told the grocer to keep a bottle of vodka in the freezer.

2380
02:21:49.371 --> 02:21:54.320
So it's like 10:00 AM he's slamming alcohol.
He comes back to the yacht hammered.

2381
02:21:54.440 --> 02:21:56.780
He's throwing chicken breasts against the gallery wall laughing.

2382
02:21:57.050 --> 02:22:01.130
And we had to keep the guests on the Sundeck and fire and tender them off.

2383
02:22:01.970 --> 02:22:05.060
Yeah.
And then how hard is it to replace someone like that quickly?

2384
02:22:05.061 --> 02:22:08.240
It's got to be,
when you're in a yachting hub,

2385
02:22:08.300 --> 02:22:11.240
there's usually one on shore that you can bring on real quick.
Right.

2386
02:22:11.241 --> 02:22:13.670
So when you dock,
they're all,
and everyone drinks a bunch.

2387
02:22:13.671 --> 02:22:17.840
You're writing about that drinking culture to work hard,
play hard.

2388
02:22:17.870 --> 02:22:20.570
I mean it's an industry of people that worked hard.

2389
02:22:20.571 --> 02:22:24.320
They want to blow off steam and they got money to spend and yeah.
You know,
Oh,

2390
02:22:24.321 --> 02:22:26.730
I wanted to ask you about this.
Um,

2391
02:22:26.910 --> 02:22:30.330
you mentioned that you try not to cry on charter,

2392
02:22:30.331 --> 02:22:32.700
especially in front of cameras.
Um,

2393
02:22:32.730 --> 02:22:37.730
there seems to me to be a theme on the show of fucking cry babies who for

2394
02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:42.240
whatever reason breakdown and call their fucking mommy's all the time and cry

2395
02:22:42.241 --> 02:22:45.000
about like rocky was a notorious,

2396
02:22:45.060 --> 02:22:48.810
we cry baby mommy call her right to keep Rocky's mother's phone number,

2397
02:22:49.010 --> 02:22:52.500
the dry erase board because that's how many breakdown she had.

2398
02:22:52.501 --> 02:22:55.710
Like it was like speed dial at Rocky's mom,
here's her number,

2399
02:22:55.711 --> 02:23:00.530
where I need that tomorrow again.
Yeah.
Um,
I just don't get it.
Uh,

2400
02:23:00.531 --> 02:23:05.100
this,
I don't get the confusion like you signed up and if they say they haven't

2401
02:23:05.101 --> 02:23:06.690
watched the show,
they're lying or they're stupid.

2402
02:23:06.800 --> 02:23:11.220
Like there's no excuse for you to come in at this point and not know what to

2403
02:23:11.221 --> 02:23:16.170
expect.
And also you're getting a lot of money,
a lot of tip money.

2404
02:23:16.410 --> 02:23:19.170
Is it too much for me to ask that you,
you know,
do the job as well?

2405
02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:22.140
Well they don't seem to understand that there's work involved.

2406
02:23:22.141 --> 02:23:26.130
And then what does it matter what the chiefs do is doing?

2407
02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:28.770
Like what does it matter if what your doing has nothing to do?

2408
02:23:28.771 --> 02:23:31.320
Like you give them the order.
And it always bothers me when they're like,

2409
02:23:31.470 --> 02:23:35.110
well what is Kate doing?
It's like,
bitch,
it's not of your fucking,
yeah,

2410
02:23:36.670 --> 02:23:40.290
she's your boss.
Your boss is like,
go do this.
Like what are you doing boss?

2411
02:23:40.440 --> 02:23:41.670
You would never do that in real life.

2412
02:23:41.700 --> 02:23:43.350
But I think it's because you live with them.

2413
02:23:43.351 --> 02:23:48.270
You must feel like we're more roommates than coworkers or subordinates.

2414
02:23:48.271 --> 02:23:51.180
You know,
it blurs the line for people who don't haven't done it a lot.

2415
02:23:51.540 --> 02:23:54.990
And I'll admit when I was a second stu,
I thought the chief,
so I was like,
oh,

2416
02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.450
don't be such a such a good chief.
Do,
how hard can it be?

2417
02:23:57.630 --> 02:24:01.380
And then I got my first chief Stu job and I wrote an email to my cheese to that.

2418
02:24:01.381 --> 02:24:04.770
I've been real sassy too.
I was like,
Mia Culpa.
I am so sorry.
This is way harder.

2419
02:24:04.771 --> 02:24:07.410
I didn't realize there's a lot of stuff that you know.

2420
02:24:07.680 --> 02:24:10.680
I think that's with any work,
you don't know what the boss above you is doing.

2421
02:24:10.980 --> 02:24:12.840
I think it's a good thing though because I've seen this,

2422
02:24:12.841 --> 02:24:17.841
I mean most on your show and like other work environments where somebody goes

2423
02:24:18.631 --> 02:24:21.810
like,
there won't be really a hierarchy here and that's a problem.

2424
02:24:21.811 --> 02:24:26.730
You should set up the hierarchy.
Yeah,
yeah,
of course.

2425
02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:28.140
It's not because I want to boss you around.

2426
02:24:28.141 --> 02:24:29.730
It's because we need structure to get things done.

2427
02:24:29.731 --> 02:24:31.530
Otherwise it's going to be a free for all.

2428
02:24:31.800 --> 02:24:35.460
Here's the reality show experience that we have.
Just so you know.

2429
02:24:38.970 --> 02:24:41.960
Oh yeah.
Oh,
thanks.

2430
02:24:43.140 --> 02:24:44.280
<v 2>The hair,
man.</v>

2431
02:24:44.750 --> 02:24:49.110
That was the late nineties there's Chadwick who still keep in touch.

2432
02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:56.520
Oh my God.
This is why I may have false.
This is the first mission.

2433
02:24:56.521 --> 02:24:59.880
Look how skinny I was.
You have a permit frog tattoo.
Oh

2434
02:25:02.500 --> 02:25:06.310
<v 7>stamp before they were called tramp stamps.
I got it in Australia on the show.</v>

2435
02:25:07.220 --> 02:25:08.053
I'm embarrassed,

2436
02:25:12.770 --> 02:25:17.080
<v 2>right?
Yes.</v>

2437
02:25:17.170 --> 02:25:21.430
<v 7>Oh yes.
I worked on this.
I mean when I say worked on,</v>

2438
02:25:21.431 --> 02:25:23.960
I was in post on the episode,
it says,

2439
02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:27.880
<v 4>put your hands down.
He says Shimmy.
She might go in here and</v>

2440
02:25:29.930 --> 02:25:34.370
he or she goes,
do you have your assignments?
Slept.

2441
02:25:34.420 --> 02:25:39.300
It went very viral and that was,
she really

2442
02:25:41.860 --> 02:25:45.890
did.
She asked if she believed that God.
Oh,
she comes to staff.

2443
02:25:47.690 --> 02:25:52.550
It could be a Jew and believing
that and stop.

2444
02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:55.080
Yeah.
See

2445
02:25:57.150 --> 02:26:01.290
the entire house is dark side.
It's Dork.

2446
02:26:02.490 --> 02:26:05.320
She is dark Saturday.
Oh my gosh.

2447
02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:07.680
<v 7>Do you ever have one of those on your charter?</v>

2448
02:26:09.180 --> 02:26:13.230
<v 4>I mean rocky was close to that.
Yeah,
a little no money.
A little less.</v>

2449
02:26:13.820 --> 02:26:17.380
Oh my God,
this is tainted.

2450
02:26:18.550 --> 02:26:23.220
It's a check.
What are on the show?
Oh she's mad at production right now.

2451
02:26:23.370 --> 02:26:25.380
<v 0>She's mad at the whole thing cause they,</v>

2452
02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:29.190
they traded families and she went to see Goosey,

2453
02:26:29.460 --> 02:26:33.240
like everything's cool house.
And that lady was in her house.
So she's like,

2454
02:26:33.480 --> 02:26:36.780
you know,
she,
she was a Christian.
She was in our house and she hated the whole,

2455
02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:39.080
it was all evil.
Everything was the devil.
And she's like,
I'm a god

2456
02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:40.033
<v 4>warrior.</v>

2457
02:26:46.700 --> 02:26:51.140
Yes.
Where is she now?

2458
02:26:51.390 --> 02:26:55.730
<v 0>Love to know.
Just be surprised if she were alive.
But yeah,
she um,</v>

2459
02:26:55.890 --> 02:26:59.550
I remember when those tapes came in cause I was working as opposed coordinator

2460
02:26:59.551 --> 02:27:01.170
on this episode and you know,

2461
02:27:01.171 --> 02:27:06.090
that's when we would send out a pa just to fly to the location,

2462
02:27:06.330 --> 02:27:09.600
pick up the physical tapes because now things are probably digitized.

2463
02:27:09.601 --> 02:27:12.870
And so back then you had a flight pick up the tape and that person would

2464
02:27:12.871 --> 02:27:16.950
literally board a plane just with tapes and these tapes came in and I was

2465
02:27:16.951 --> 02:27:19.710
working the late shift and one of the editors was like,

2466
02:27:19.711 --> 02:27:23.040
you guys got to fucking see this.
Yeah,
we,
we all go in there and we're like,

2467
02:27:23.130 --> 02:27:24.870
oh shit.
And everyone knew immediately.

2468
02:27:24.871 --> 02:27:29.871
Like this is going to be huge because it's basically what you want somebody

2469
02:27:29.881 --> 02:27:33.840
losing their mind.
Yeah.
It's the best reality on network TV.

2470
02:27:34.500 --> 02:27:35.100
Sun Rolls

2471
02:27:35.100 --> 02:27:39.540
<v 7>back in the day,
we weren't,
they weren't casting nuts yet.</v>

2472
02:27:39.770 --> 02:27:42.240
Like we weren't genuine.
They're cast.
Here's what happened.

2473
02:27:42.241 --> 02:27:45.450
Mary Alice [inaudible] of Buna Marie,
she came from a soap opera background.

2474
02:27:45.630 --> 02:27:49.380
So her casting decisions were based on finding interesting people,

2475
02:27:49.620 --> 02:27:52.010
not crazy people.
I like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2476
02:27:52.110 --> 02:27:54.300
And I think that's why below deck is so successful.

2477
02:27:54.301 --> 02:27:56.880
You've got a good mix of both.
Well,
especially this season.

2478
02:27:56.881 --> 02:27:59.310
We've got a great mix of intense personalities,

2479
02:27:59.311 --> 02:28:04.260
but none of them are like off crazy.
It's like fun.
Crazy.
Yeah.
Um,

2480
02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:04.800
yeah.

2481
02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:09.330
I guess road rose is kind of similar to below deck and then close spaces.

2482
02:28:09.331 --> 02:28:12.880
How did,
yeah,
she's,
you love it.
I liked it a lot and they had origins.

2483
02:28:12.890 --> 02:28:17.700
We all the time and now my nerd it,
I liked it cause yeah.
You traveled.

2484
02:28:17.840 --> 02:28:21.980
How did you broke or so back in the day,
they filmed for full months,

2485
02:28:22.250 --> 02:28:25.190
so now in the real world used to film for like five months,

2486
02:28:25.191 --> 02:28:26.950
but now they've got that little shows cancel.

2487
02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:29.870
But they got the show down to like a month maybe.
Yeah.

2488
02:28:30.440 --> 02:28:33.380
But we didn't always sleep.
Stay in the Winnebago.
That was a production thing.

2489
02:28:33.410 --> 02:28:36.080
They just made it look like we did.
We stayed in youth hostels a lot,

2490
02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:39.590
but we're all in the same room like walking together.
It was super cute.

2491
02:28:39.800 --> 02:28:42.920
What a good life.
It was great man.
Nobody,
we didn't,

2492
02:28:42.921 --> 02:28:45.920
we fought but nobody hooked up.
Of course it was innocent.

2493
02:28:45.980 --> 02:28:47.270
And you were in Australia.
Yeah.

2494
02:28:47.650 --> 02:28:52.100
And you did a tour around Australia for two months.
Yeah,
it was great.
I was what,

2495
02:28:52.101 --> 02:28:55.390
21 years old and I got to see another country and you know,

2496
02:28:55.450 --> 02:28:59.260
be on MTV and it was like I want to share.
Sure.
Right.

2497
02:29:00.140 --> 02:29:01.250
And then you did the challenge.

2498
02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:04.550
I did one challenge in Jamaica and I was miserable.

2499
02:29:04.551 --> 02:29:08.210
I had a nervous breakdown by day two.
I was like I can these people.

2500
02:29:08.211 --> 02:29:11.500
Cause by then it was the nut bags.
They had cast tense.
Yeah.

2501
02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:12.740
I don't like that shit.
Also,

2502
02:29:12.741 --> 02:29:16.010
I don't think I would ever like to be on a reality show.
What's a competition?
Uh,

2503
02:29:16.220 --> 02:29:19.460
top chef or like a project underway or terrible drag race.

2504
02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:21.230
The competition of it all.

2505
02:29:21.231 --> 02:29:25.160
I don't like it stress me out so much that I will maybe eliminate it on national

2506
02:29:25.161 --> 02:29:26.570
television like that.

2507
02:29:26.571 --> 02:29:29.780
You're setting yourself up for humiliation unless you are that one person that

2508
02:29:29.781 --> 02:29:32.930
wins and that would not bring out the best.
Now I'd be like,
well on,

2509
02:29:32.931 --> 02:29:37.220
especially because I was 26 years old by the time I'd done a the challenge and

2510
02:29:37.221 --> 02:29:40.970
they were like sit on a block of ice and a bikini for two hours for a free bike.

2511
02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:45.380
And I was like,
listen motherfuckers,
I got $100 I can go buy a bike.
Yeah,

2512
02:29:45.440 --> 02:29:49.400
I'm too old for this.
When you're 21 they take your pills and they're like,

2513
02:29:49.401 --> 02:29:52.760
jump off a cliff to earn $100.
Like okay,
I can,
I got to eat today.

2514
02:29:52.761 --> 02:29:54.170
It's a different,
yeah.
Well a

2515
02:29:54.210 --> 02:29:58.500
<v 0>change to where the formula became let's get people crazy people and,</v>

2516
02:29:58.720 --> 02:30:03.050
and hammered.
Yeah.
So it just became about,
cause I went was I went with you,

2517
02:30:03.051 --> 02:30:06.010
they asked you to go to some while I was friends with Chris of breakout was

2518
02:30:06.020 --> 02:30:09.380
telling me like a dinner or something.
Yeah.
And I saw these,
the,

2519
02:30:09.420 --> 02:30:14.000
the cameras and I was like,
I started,
I mean I got like real anxiety.
I was like,

2520
02:30:14.001 --> 02:30:17.450
I don't want to be a part of this at all.
And then I noticed that I was like,

2521
02:30:17.460 --> 02:30:21.050
I'm just going to literally stand in the background,
not be a part of this that,

2522
02:30:21.290 --> 02:30:21.471
you know,

2523
02:30:21.471 --> 02:30:25.100
they were giving everyone drinks and then somebody would have a few drinks come

2524
02:30:25.101 --> 02:30:30.050
over and be like,
Hey,
what is your fucking problem?
Exactly.
Like out of nowhere.

2525
02:30:30.200 --> 02:30:33.980
And that was the fuel for the conversation in the show.
And I was like,

2526
02:30:33.981 --> 02:30:38.680
this is contrived and fueled by alcohol.
It's like,
I don't like it.
I like,

2527
02:30:38.750 --> 02:30:42.240
if you're clever enough,
you don't need to rely on this,
you know,

2528
02:30:42.350 --> 02:30:45.260
to make entertainment that's so base level.
Like,
yeah,

2529
02:30:45.320 --> 02:30:49.700
I prefer if I'm going to be on TV,
let's make it entertaining and not just gross.

2530
02:30:49.730 --> 02:30:52.180
Sure.
Yeah.
Look at these,
look at this thing.
Debt.
That's right.

2531
02:30:52.220 --> 02:30:56.150
They were smaller back then.
They were maybe c pluses.

2532
02:30:56.760 --> 02:31:01.730
I'm 21 and I was so skinny and I had those huge knockers.
Yeah,
meet.

2533
02:31:02.150 --> 02:31:06.020
We met doing standup out here in la like a million years ago.
Years ago.

2534
02:31:06.070 --> 02:31:09.680
We've been together for like 14 years.
Oh my gosh.
Look at that other dog.
Damn,

2535
02:31:09.681 --> 02:31:12.650
that was a far jump there.
That was 50 feet.
No,

2536
02:31:12.651 --> 02:31:15.860
25 feet and then 50 it was really scary actually.

2537
02:31:15.890 --> 02:31:19.710
They don't let you do this anymore at Wyoming for sure.
Oh yeah.
Was the night

2538
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:23.400
<v 7>and we used to sign release forms before every mission before we knew what they</v>

2539
02:31:23.401 --> 02:31:26.790
were and it was to release the company from any liability.

2540
02:31:26.791 --> 02:31:28.470
And I was wrestling crocodiles,

2541
02:31:28.471 --> 02:31:32.800
jumping off a cliff and back then they didn't give a good dude,
whatever you,

2542
02:31:33.030 --> 02:31:35.370
are you really that brave or was it because you were on TV and you were like,

2543
02:31:35.371 --> 02:31:38.100
well I can't give up.
No,
I didn't want him to be on road rules.

2544
02:31:38.101 --> 02:31:41.250
I asked to be on the real world.
I was like,
put me in a house for five months.

2545
02:31:41.251 --> 02:31:44.520
I want to smoke some cigarettes.
I want to eat.
I want to like talk to people.

2546
02:31:45.060 --> 02:31:47.130
I don't want to do anything.
And that's why they're like,

2547
02:31:47.160 --> 02:31:51.120
you're going to go on road rules.
And I was like,
is it free travel?
Okay.

2548
02:31:51.121 --> 02:31:55.410
I was living in a closet in San Francisco because rent was so expensive in the

2549
02:31:55.410 --> 02:31:56.340
90s,
and I just wanted out.

2550
02:31:56.940 --> 02:32:01.940
So what's the most ridiculous request you've had from a charter guest?

2551
02:32:02.630 --> 02:32:03.463
Yeah,

2552
02:32:03.570 --> 02:32:07.380
I can ask this question all the time and as I should have a good solid answer,

2553
02:32:07.620 --> 02:32:11.430
but it turns out nothing's that ridiculous to me because it's all so ridiculous.

2554
02:32:11.840 --> 02:32:14.880
But I'll give some examples like I'm just to sensitize.
Uh,

2555
02:32:14.910 --> 02:32:19.120
I had a two week charter on,
they were Russians again and uh,

2556
02:32:19.260 --> 02:32:23.220
I know they have a lot of long island,
right?
Yeah.

2557
02:32:23.221 --> 02:32:26.670
And also duck cock Molotov cocktails.

2558
02:32:26.890 --> 02:32:28.920
And so they brought on their fi,

2559
02:32:28.980 --> 02:32:31.650
their wives and their children for the first week and we get to know them and

2560
02:32:31.651 --> 02:32:34.140
where I making for the babies.
Okay.

2561
02:32:34.141 --> 02:32:38.280
By now the wives and children are leaving and we're in Saint Martin and

2562
02:32:38.281 --> 02:32:42.210
literally I see the private chat with the mothers and the children flying over

2563
02:32:42.211 --> 02:32:46.680
us.
Well,
s gaggle of hookers or walking on board.

2564
02:32:48.220 --> 02:32:53.100
Hi.
And it's hard for us because we just got to know your children and your wives

2565
02:32:53.101 --> 02:32:54.240
and now we have to be like,

2566
02:32:55.950 --> 02:33:00.540
and so they were up in the Jacuzzi having a good time and I asked my stewardess

2567
02:33:00.541 --> 02:33:03.600
came down,
she's like,
I'm not going up there anymore.
And I was like,
why should,

2568
02:33:03.601 --> 02:33:05.520
well they offer something in their hand or mouth anyway,

2569
02:33:05.521 --> 02:33:09.630
so there's not like there's anything I could give them.
I know.

2570
02:33:10.080 --> 02:33:14.490
That's awesome.
Yeah,
it was funny.
That's brutal though,
man.

2571
02:33:15.080 --> 02:33:19.880
Fish.
Do you guys,
when,

2572
02:33:19.900 --> 02:33:22.380
when,
when you have clients like that or,
or maybe just in general,

2573
02:33:22.381 --> 02:33:25.920
is there a bunch of nondisclosures that these people make you sign it?
I mean,

2574
02:33:25.921 --> 02:33:26.940
you would think so.

2575
02:33:26.970 --> 02:33:30.480
I don't think they expected that their stewardess was going to go on a reality

2576
02:33:30.481 --> 02:33:35.190
show.
It's Phil other secrets podcast when the celebs come on.
Um,
yeah,

2577
02:33:35.820 --> 02:33:38.880
there's huge nondisclosures for like Jay Z and Beyonce.

2578
02:33:38.881 --> 02:33:43.020
They always rent a yacht in the wintertime and their crew is like sworn to

2579
02:33:43.021 --> 02:33:46.900
secrecy.
I worked on one yacht,
I had to sign an NDA.
Was this she?

2580
02:33:47.010 --> 02:33:51.210
She's a music producer.
Um,
and she has a lot of celebrities come on.

2581
02:33:51.211 --> 02:33:54.840
Like Kim and Kanye came on start.
Jones came on.
Well that's not really the same,

2582
02:33:55.290 --> 02:33:59.750
but she only brings on famous people.
Yeah,

2583
02:33:59.760 --> 02:34:03.600
we had to sign to sign your contract.
You have to say,
I won't say anything.

2584
02:34:03.750 --> 02:34:07.380
And on the show,
by the way,
when it's tip time,
the tips are always cash.

2585
02:34:09.390 --> 02:34:12.770
Sometimes you'll get a wire.
But yeah,
somebody asked me like,
do they travel?

2586
02:34:12.780 --> 02:34:16.380
How much cash?
And I'm like,
I guess they do.
That's wild.
That's wild.

2587
02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:19.230
All 50 grand I just brought with me.

2588
02:34:19.540 --> 02:34:22.510
But they're going on a private jet so that doesn't really matter.

2589
02:34:22.650 --> 02:34:26.800
I guess you're not going to the ATM.
Sure.
And the bug.
We'll get some tip money.

2590
02:34:26.810 --> 02:34:30.050
Philly has a limit.
We've got to do it four more times.
Yeah.

2591
02:34:30.440 --> 02:34:33.040
Well what if this guy were like a charter guest?
Would you,

2592
02:34:33.041 --> 02:34:33.970
what would you do for him?

2593
02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:39.000
You know what God's love to fuck and fuck gook that's draw hot black guy.

2594
02:34:39.761 --> 02:34:44.320
And you want to fuck me at 2195 if you want to move in,
you can move up.

2595
02:34:44.321 --> 02:34:49.030
But you got to fuck the how many I need to be fucked a lot,
man.
Ever free food,

2596
02:34:49.031 --> 02:34:52.780
free rent and everything else,
man.
He has a deal man.
Well I first of all,

2597
02:34:52.781 --> 02:34:57.780
I like to know that I can cuss on here cause I did and now I'm up
first.

2598
02:34:57.830 --> 02:34:59.380
I obviously make him a dick blanket

2599
02:35:01.310 --> 02:35:06.040
every day and then I would make sure we went somewhere that had what he was

2600
02:35:06.041 --> 02:35:06.874
looking for.

2601
02:35:07.720 --> 02:35:11.560
It sounds to me like I wouldn't be having to serve him too much if I found,

2602
02:35:11.640 --> 02:35:16.000
you know?
Yeah,
you keep busy.
Yeah.
So Baby Caribbean,

2603
02:35:16.001 --> 02:35:20.650
you would stay there for sure.
100% yeah.
Hey,
what do you think?
Cause I'm so,

2604
02:35:20.940 --> 02:35:24.040
I,
I dunno,
I can't imagine doing your job.

2605
02:35:24.041 --> 02:35:28.280
I can't imagine being nice to shit bird people.
Like how,

2606
02:35:28.540 --> 02:35:30.970
what kind of personality type is drawn to this work?

2607
02:35:30.971 --> 02:35:35.940
You think honestly on real yachts and aren't being filmed on TV that guests

2608
02:35:35.950 --> 02:35:39.430
don't really want to talk to you that much.
There's there to chill out,
relax,

2609
02:35:39.431 --> 02:35:44.430
take a nap.
And the Russians definitely don't want you to talk to them like no,

2610
02:35:44.510 --> 02:35:48.700
no,
no.
They want to keep it separate.
So do they speak English?

2611
02:35:48.701 --> 02:35:51.280
Most of the ones that come here,
they do and they're nice enough,

2612
02:35:51.281 --> 02:35:53.860
but they're not there to talk to us.
They're like,

2613
02:35:53.861 --> 02:35:57.130
I would want my coffee and they won't even say thank you half the time,

2614
02:35:57.310 --> 02:36:01.090
which is fine cause you just drop it off,
go back to the crew mess and whatever.

2615
02:36:01.270 --> 02:36:04.870
It's the guests that want to talk.
It's almost,
that's more work.
It's like,

2616
02:36:04.900 --> 02:36:05.860
yeah hmm.

2617
02:36:05.861 --> 02:36:08.890
We could have this fake conversation but also I've got a bunch of shit to do for

2618
02:36:08.891 --> 02:36:13.140
you.
So it's like,
I don't love chatting with the guests that are nice.
I,

2619
02:36:13.540 --> 02:36:17.980
I like Russian asshole.
You know.

2620
02:36:18.510 --> 02:36:21.520
I know what you're getting.
That guy.
Yeah,
that guy.
That way.

2621
02:36:21.521 --> 02:36:24.940
Cause you know what you're getting though to the Russian guys direct.

2622
02:36:24.940 --> 02:36:29.020
There's no like,
yeah,
here's what I want and I don't want any bullshit.

2623
02:36:29.070 --> 02:36:32.440
I mean I've worked for lovely American people and that's great too.
Um,

2624
02:36:32.770 --> 02:36:36.760
I guess the worst ones are the ones that want to party,
party,
party.

2625
02:36:36.880 --> 02:36:39.550
And usually it's people who have inherited their money that are the worst

2626
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:44.980
because most 99% of yacht owners are self made.
And so they're busy,

2627
02:36:44.981 --> 02:36:47.590
they're still working and they're like,
you know,
they're chilling out,

2628
02:36:47.591 --> 02:36:50.470
their families relaxing.
But the businessman,
the money maker he used,

2629
02:36:50.650 --> 02:36:53.110
he's still working,
but it's the ones that inherit their money.

2630
02:36:53.260 --> 02:36:56.470
They don't appreciate anything.
It's just,
that's a nightmare.

2631
02:36:56.680 --> 02:37:00.070
So what happens like the morning after the hookers,

2632
02:37:00.071 --> 02:37:02.980
you guys got to put on a nice face.
Good morning.
Uh,
yeah.

2633
02:37:02.981 --> 02:37:06.430
And that's real difficult when you go into to make their bed and it looks like a

2634
02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:10.540
murder snuff film because like there's like hand prints and sheets are off the

2635
02:37:10.541 --> 02:37:13.750
bed and what I hope is lotion on the glass door,
but I don't know.

2636
02:37:14.050 --> 02:37:16.220
And you're just like on your walkie talkie,

2637
02:37:16.221 --> 02:37:21.140
we're gonna need a stick at least six foot long and a lot of gloves.
Oh yeah,

2638
02:37:21.141 --> 02:37:25.190
it gets gross.
Yeah.
Cause I've heard the story of the toilets are gnarly too,

2639
02:37:25.191 --> 02:37:27.860
right?
You,
I'm sure you've seen,
well you can't really put much down at,

2640
02:37:27.861 --> 02:37:30.260
but then when they get drunk,
they forget that.

2641
02:37:30.261 --> 02:37:34.400
So that's not a good day for the engineers.
But um,
yeah.

2642
02:37:34.401 --> 02:37:37.790
And also they drink so much and I think when you're on a yacht in international

2643
02:37:37.791 --> 02:37:41.930
waters,
you're like,
there are no laws here.
Let's get crazy.

2644
02:37:41.960 --> 02:37:44.870
Nobody could see me.
We're in the middle of the ocean.
So they just,

2645
02:37:44.871 --> 02:37:49.070
it's the worst behavior.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I got to get this.
Oh yeah,

2646
02:37:49.071 --> 02:37:53.990
we got to do this,
man.
Yeah,
come on.
So we 200 grand for a week.
No,
no,
no.

2647
02:37:54.020 --> 02:37:56.690
That's the minimum.
That's the minimum.
We haven't paid for our food,

2648
02:37:57.720 --> 02:38:02.390
our tip fuel.
None of it yet.
So as captain leave,
if we can work something out.

2649
02:38:02.410 --> 02:38:05.920
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Oh my gosh.
Yeah.

2650
02:38:05.930 --> 02:38:10.890
Just ask him for like an 80% break on it.
I'll see what I can do.
Okay.
Thank you.

2651
02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:15.020
Thank you.
It's a banana.
So what are you doing now?
So you got Bravo.
Yeah,

2652
02:38:15.050 --> 02:38:17.000
you got your book out.
Where can people get your book?

2653
02:38:17.300 --> 02:38:22.040
It's on Amazon and it's called lucky.
Charming and I recorded the audio book,

2654
02:38:22.190 --> 02:38:24.050
which quite frankly I love an audio book.

2655
02:38:24.051 --> 02:38:27.590
You can like listen to it while you're cleaning and drinking wine.
Yeah.

2656
02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:29.720
Drinking wine and then not so much cleaning.

2657
02:38:29.780 --> 02:38:32.600
And where do people get that one that's going to be available on Amazon as well?

2658
02:38:32.601 --> 02:38:36.170
I've recorded it and I just haven't published it yet.
Very.
Yeah,

2659
02:38:36.171 --> 02:38:39.440
but the show's so good this season.
It's my favorite season of below deck.

2660
02:38:39.441 --> 02:38:42.590
It's the biggest boat,
the best location,
the best crew.

2661
02:38:42.710 --> 02:38:47.030
They're crazy and experience.
And it's Tuesdays at nine on Bravo guys.

2662
02:38:47.031 --> 02:38:50.190
Get on at Dewa.
We do.
I mean you can,
you can obviously go Tuesdays.

2663
02:38:50.191 --> 02:38:52.550
Isn't that Bravo?
We just buy the season pass.

2664
02:38:52.730 --> 02:38:56.000
We buy the show so that we don't have to watch commercials.
That is commitment.

2665
02:38:56.030 --> 02:39:00.400
I appreciate it.
Yeah,
we buy the season pass immediately.
Um,
or yeah,

2666
02:39:00.420 --> 02:39:04.190
or you can go on the Bravo App.
I'm sure you can stream it there too.

2667
02:39:04.580 --> 02:39:08.510
But this has been an absolute thrill for us.
Me Too.
Thank you so much.

2668
02:39:08.560 --> 02:39:11.930
Oh so excited.
Can't wait to watch more below deck.

2669
02:39:11.960 --> 02:39:15.950
I hope you guys keep making 15 more seasons of it,
and,
um,
thank you.

2670
02:39:15.980 --> 02:39:17.930
Thank you again for coming.
Thank you for having me.

2671
02:39:23.770 --> 02:39:24.603
<v 17>Wow.</v>

2672
02:39:28.200 --> 02:39:29.033
Oh,

2673
02:39:36.250 --> 02:39:40.250
sure.
Okay.

2674
02:40:02.160 --> 02:40:02.993
Yeah,

2675
02:40:10.440 --> 02:40:11.273
yeah.

2676
02:40:35.690 --> 02:40:36.523
Wow.

2677
02:40:53.400 --> 02:40:53.800
Harris.
