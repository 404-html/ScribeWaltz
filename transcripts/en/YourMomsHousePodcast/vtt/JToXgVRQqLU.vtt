1
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.290
Well.
Well,
well go to your mom's house,

2
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.413
Christina.

3
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.320
<v 2>Oh,</v>

4
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.110
<v 0>song was everywhere in the 90s yeah,
everywhere.
Every mall.</v>

5
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.080
It was always on.
The video was always on MTV.
It was such a uh,

6
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.770
such an orgy song and Nigga that is,
that's the name of the band.
Yeah.

7
00:00:48.771 --> 00:00:52.580
If you were a swinger,
you participated in orgies.
I bet they played that song.

8
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.460
All it's,
every French person alive has come to that.

9
00:00:55.461 --> 00:01:00.290
So the whole country orgasms at once and play it at your eighth grade
graduation.

10
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.280
Oh Wow.
You are an adult now.
Come with us like at your Bar Mitzvah.

11
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.923
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

12
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.250
<v 0>and it's one of the few songs to make it to make,
to get,</v>

13
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.230
I can't talk to make it mainstream.
That incorporated like a pan flute.

14
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.000
Is that what that was?

15
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.990
But also it is without a doubt.

16
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.300
Ultra sexual.
Yeah.
And then if they don't have to,

17
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.120
not in the lyrics,
like he just listens to it.
Yeah.

18
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.150
Because the ladies coming as she's like heavy breathing and I know it sounds

19
00:01:41.441 --> 00:01:46.090
like she's like,
give me two more threats.
That's what she's saying in French.

20
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.530
All right.
It's really,
really put a tail on me.
What are you checking there?

21
00:01:50.531 --> 00:01:54.430
What's going on?
A drug,
Lord.
El Chapo has been extra day.
United States.

22
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.590
Oh,
snaps.
Ooh.

23
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.660
Did President Obama or elect Trump just text you that?

24
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.660
Dani t just texted me while he's pretty active on,
they said he uh,

25
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.620
he gives out his direct cell phone number to people.
I bet he does all the uh,

26
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.350
national security people are like,
you can't do yeah.

27
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.310
Like you can't have a president now phone.
It was set up by himself.

28
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.460
I think he became president just for the Twitter followers.

29
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.460
I think he does love Twitter.
I mean,
yeah,
a little too much.

30
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.730
Do you think he'll dial it back?
Maladies.
Surprise Pres.

31
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.650
That's really interesting.
Pardon me?
Really hopes he doesn't,

32
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.800
even though it's easy to critique him for it,
it's kind of fun.
Yeah.

33
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.370
That the president is like watching SNL and being like,

34
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.000
that's an else sucks cause they make fun of them.
Well,
I don't know.

35
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.610
It makes me laugh.
I think what's absurd though is that he constantly lies.

36
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.050
You remember the ticket thing you were telling me about this morning?

37
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.740
Like 30 people didn't want to go 30 Democrats.
Uh,
so I'm going to take it,

38
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.220
but it's not going to tell you God's.
Yeah.
Well that's part of why,

39
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.400
that's how he's a salesman in a showman.

40
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.200
And what he did was he built the Trump brand off of,
you know,

41
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.370
basically off of personality.
He's a reality star and he's really good at that.

42
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.870
Like that's really good.
A good lane.

43
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.560
So what he's doing is that's an extension of it.
So like all these,
uh,

44
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.040
I think it's something like 50 house.
Damn.
And that's not a good choice.

45
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.390
The choice you made was better.
50.
How's dams are not attending the inauguration.

46
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:22.840
Right.
So they ask him about it.
He goes,
I hope we get their tickets.

47
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.010
So many people want tickets.
So many people will tickets.
Yeah.
I would just,

48
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.490
I hope we get the tickets.
Yeah.
So it's just the positive spin thing on a bad,

49
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.710
which is actually a pretty decent approach to be taking.

50
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.420
I think that approach in life.
Yeah.
Is a good one.
It's a Barnum.
And Bailey,

51
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.000
it's PT Barnum.
Sorry.
No,
PT Barnum had the same thing.

52
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:46.470
He would create a spectacle to get people to pay attention 100% him.

53
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.020
It's a thing.
Look,
I hope it,
I hope it goes well.
I'm not kidding.

54
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.180
So do I do hope that these,
these next four years are good and uh,
yeah.

55
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.210
You know,
the,
I dunno,
there's not much more to say than that,
but um,
yeah.

56
00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.630
Well what,
it is funny when he's like,
Aye,
everybody just wants to tickets.
Oh,

57
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.570
crazy.
Yeah.
Okay Buddy.
He's always saying he's doing better than he is.

58
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:11.230
Like approval ratings are bullshit everybody.
And you're like,
hmm.
Yeah,
yeah.

59
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.010
Who knows?
Who knows what's in store for more important things to talk about.

60
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.520
If you don't
look at this list today,

61
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.810
I know of notes that I have for today's show.
There's a lot to go over.

62
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.170
You ready to get this started?

It's going to be on tour with me.</v>

77
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.290
Um,
limited amounts obviously,

78
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.900
but it is online on our store.

79
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.800
If you go to Thomson [inaudible] Dot Com and you click on the store,

80
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:18.080
it takes you to our,
our merchandise page.
We have a bunch of stuff there.
Uh,

81
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:21.680
this one was designed by a really,
really great artists.
Dave Glock,

82
00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:23.990
if you ever did meltdown every week,

83
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.690
a unique poster was created for the meltdown show.
Um,

84
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.690
like specific for that week.

85
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.640
It's a lot of work and Dave Glock designed each and every one of them.
Uh,

86
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.630
and he did the shirt.
He did the no teeth,
no entry tour shirt.
Like I said,

87
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:40.460
I'll have a,
I'll have a limited amount with me,

88
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:44.390
but they will also be for sale on the store.
That being that,

89
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.550
um,
really talk about that.
Uh,
sure.

90
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.220
I mean we'll,
we'll,
whatever.
Sure.
Well,

91
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:54.830
I'm just thought we should announce at the top of the show why not.

92
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:59.330
On the 12th of February we have a nine o'clock show added to your mom's house,

93
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:03.720
live in Irvine and having special guests,
Yoshi.
Oh,
by Shea,

94
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.330
the 7:00 PM is sold out.

95
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.810
We added the nine and we invited Yoshi to join us on that.
Uh,

96
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.150
if you want to do both shows,

97
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:14.650
we're doing two different shows and then when people are gonna want to know

98
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.560
super,
Super Mommy dy dynamics.
Um,

99
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.410
what did I want to tell you?
Uh,

100
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.720
I'm still recovering from 24 hours with burnt special fat loss trip together.

101
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.440
We did Joe Rogan a offered and uh,
came through with,
um,

102
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.460
you know,
I saw an opportunity,
I was looking for something fun to do.

103
00:07:37.461 --> 00:07:41.420
And you know,
too often I think you go well,
just something in like nine months.

104
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.800
Wow.
And,
um,
that really,
really,
definitely pop someone's ears out,

105
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:51.710
just so you know.
Um,
I think,
yeah,
I think,
um,

106
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.560
you know,
I tried to look for something that was coming up quick anyways.

107
00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:56.930
I see cavs are playing the warriors.

108
00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.870
It's a rematch of the NBA finals last year.

109
00:07:59.871 --> 00:08:03.980
So definitely the two biggest,
you know,
flagship names,

110
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:08.950
all teams in history,
basketball and then wait a minute,

111
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.490
it has throw stones easily.
Three of the best players in the game,

112
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:18.210
if not three of the best players in the last,
you know,
the history of it in the,

113
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.840
in the conversation,
James on the team,

114
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:24.800
he's on the calves that I must be unconsciously,
his name is sort of in the,
uh,

115
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.420
you know,
pop culture right now.

116
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.420
You come in tomorrow,
I got to tell him no,
he's going to be real.
So,
um,

117
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:37.460
but anyways,
he's on there.
Kyrie Irving's a cav big deal.
Steph curry,

118
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.930
Kevin Durant's,
she's on the team.
She's on the team.
Uh,
beautiful,

119
00:08:41.931 --> 00:08:46.550
beautiful girl.
Difficult.
Yeah.
Clay Thompson,

120
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.900
Draymond green.
Anyways,
a bunch of stars,
great atmosphere.
And like I said,

121
00:08:50.901 --> 00:08:54.920
a rematch of a game of the NBA finals last year.

122
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.610
So we go up there.

123
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:02.480
Well first we should start that burnt came over here and his drive or hit our

124
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:07.650
fence.
Um,
so I was like,
wait,
who's drinking?
Then uh,

125
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.850
bird comes into the house with like a 38 ounce Styrofoam Cup.

126
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.840
And I'm like,
oh,
I thought he had coffee in it.
Well let's,

127
00:09:15.841 --> 00:09:20.100
let's see what time it was.
It was around 8:00 AM eight 40,
actually.

128
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.920
Yeah.
So the normal assumption is that it's coffee.
Yeah.

129
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:29.130
But then he walked by me and I caught a whiff and it was vodka.

130
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.460
Yeah.
And you're like eight o'clock in the morning,
he's going to go over morning.

131
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:37.940
It really hard to do every flight and then ready to which he went to the trouble

132
00:09:40.001 --> 00:09:43.810
with me.
So then I got a peek inside.
Keep in mind,
let's hear about,

133
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.730
we all do lots and lots of flowing.
We all have our own rituals.

134
00:09:47.731 --> 00:09:48.990
We all have our own way of doing it.

135
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:54.020
So I'm getting a peek inside how the party machine flies weekly cause this every

136
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.120
single week,
twice way their way back

137
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:05.670
in the house he's drinking,
right?
We,
uh,
first of all,

138
00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:07.860
can we just talk about morning drinking?
Oh,

139
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:13.810
I don't think there's anything more disgusting and anything I could do less than

140
00:10:14.251 --> 00:10:15.750
drink alcohol at eight in the morning.

141
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.360
I just physically couldn't do it appalling.

142
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:23.361
And I see it all the time cause I fly all the time and I'm always blown away by

143
00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:26.010
it.
Um,
yeah.
Anyways,
we get to the airport.

144
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.240
He has special status on American Airlines.

145
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.970
Special special from what I was saying,

146
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:37.830
he use a concierge concierge key.
It's invitation only.

147
00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:39.120
Concierge key.

148
00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.840
They don't hit the level they invite you.

149
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:48.120
So he has so many miles from like probably doing the travel channel show to 100%

150
00:10:48.121 --> 00:10:51.990
from being a travel guy and stand up at the same time.
So cheese,

151
00:10:51.991 --> 00:10:56.700
especially that show because on the show he would do things like,
hey,

152
00:10:56.701 --> 00:11:01.050
this week you're flying to Rome a come back next week Fiji.

153
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.920
Oh my God.
Because it was a television deal.
It was always first.

154
00:11:04.921 --> 00:11:07.440
So you're spending so much money on that.

155
00:11:07.441 --> 00:11:10.560
So just racked up the diamond diamond medallion.
Well,

156
00:11:10.561 --> 00:11:14.010
they just saw like so much money being spent on your account though at this guys

157
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.580
for sure.
He has his own entrance.
Wait,

158
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.720
explain to me how at LAX,
so yeah,
you miss it.
Here's,

159
00:11:21.721 --> 00:11:26.490
here's what you pull up.
The terminal four you'll see American at the end.

160
00:11:26.491 --> 00:11:31.250
You see American priority,
which is like supposed to be priority.
I got,
yeah,

161
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.530
so it is for the elite flyers.

162
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.420
Just past that.

163
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:40.980
There's red carpet and somebody outside and a gray jacket.
Shut your mouth.

164
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.720
Gloves,
shut your mouth and that's where he pulls up.
Does every airline do this?

165
00:11:45.721 --> 00:11:50.250
No,
I looked into it.
I figured you were American.
Has It?

166
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:55.210
United has United global services,
which is invitation only.
Delta right now has,

167
00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.690
[inaudible] has obviously their diamond status.
They also have delta one,

168
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.720
which is if you're flying lax to JFK or lax to London direct or maybe one other

169
00:12:06.701 --> 00:12:10.930
place that has its own entrance,
which is its own thing.
So it has its own land.

170
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.230
<v 0>I feel like this is the special restaurant at Disneyland that you can drink</v>

171
00:12:15.231 --> 00:12:19.060
alcohol.
I only like five people in that fucking love this shit.

172
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:24.020
You're very elitist.
Yeah,
I would love.
And you love everything.
Elitist.

173
00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:29.000
Everything that separates you from the masses,
the scum of the earth.

174
00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.360
Oh my God.
You love it.
You do love feeling special at see,

175
00:12:32.361 --> 00:12:35.030
look at the smile on your face right now.
Yeah.

176
00:12:35.031 --> 00:12:37.100
Well I was just think about my personality.
Okay,

177
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.670
well the personality champ wouldn't see themselves as better than everyone else

178
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.710
and be fine.
I don't know.

179
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:48.160
You just got that whole on hoist up my slots.
So I do it.
But I,

180
00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.810
<v 5>I think part of like as far as air travel,</v>

181
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.090
I talked about this with Bernd is that,

182
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:58.900
is that part of it is that we fly so much that anything that makes you feel

183
00:12:58.971 --> 00:13:03.970
special and cuts down on the shitty part of travel is it's not so much that
like,

184
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.420
oh,
get out of my face

185
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:10.790
<v 0>joke when I say that you enjoy elitism because</v>

186
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.440
half,
yeah,
you like,
you like nice things,

187
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:20.100
but it does take the sting and this nice thing like I,

188
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.860
I like,
I like the one they happen,
but only because you make them happen.

189
00:13:23.861 --> 00:13:27.880
And then I flog myself with eastern bloc guilt that like,

190
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:32.800
should I enjoy this?
Do I deserve this?
Like I can't just enjoy.
Nice.

191
00:13:32.801 --> 00:13:34.120
Thanks.
So [inaudible]

192
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:38.890
<v 5>um,
you go there,
there's a guy in the glove.
It's very,</v>

193
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:42.070
he holds your hand first.
You walk in.
Um,
so there's,
uh,

194
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:46.330
there's a counter there and they just check you in.
Right.
You know,
they,

195
00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:48.550
even though you can be,
we were pre checked in,

196
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.240
they check you in and print out a ticket,
give you the ID,

197
00:13:52.241 --> 00:13:56.920
but they give it to the guy and then the guy,
the gray coat guy,
you're Copemon,

198
00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.020
he takes us in an elevator.

199
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:03.240
I see grain elevator or the commoners elevator elevator shut up.

200
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:08.110
There's a secret elevator at LAX.
Well,
it's just that,

201
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:11.980
no,
it's from that,
that specific terminal to wait.

202
00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:16.810
Here's the west part to the security level walks you in front of everybody.

203
00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.260
It's the best.
They,
they sign off on it.

204
00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:24.910
Then he walks you to the security counter and he puts your bags on,

205
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.760
God dammit.
And he offers to walk you to the gate.

206
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.580
Doesn't this blow your mind that that exists?

207
00:14:30.581 --> 00:14:34.420
I didn't know it existed and that this,
they invited burnt.
Oh,

208
00:14:34.421 --> 00:14:38.020
here's the other part about it.
So dammit.
So of course we go,

209
00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:43.420
first thing we do is we go to the American club room,
right?
The,
uh,
you know,

210
00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.650
like the diner's Club or those get allowance,

211
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.050
we walk in as we enter the bar area,

212
00:14:50.051 --> 00:14:52.610
they go bird like cheers.

213
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.540
They know the bartender's like bird Tito's vodka.

214
00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:02.470
So driven by the way,
what's the drink count?

215
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.890
Whatever you had before,
which I would say is to before he got,

216
00:15:06.891 --> 00:15:11.330
because that thing isn't it?
Yeah.
Uh,
then he has to at that bar,

217
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.780
Oh,
so it sounds that were flying for San Francisco.

218
00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:18.710
We're flying out of the remote terminal.
You have to get on the shuttle.

219
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:24.240
And that's for commoners.
So the shuttle,
right.
So Bartells the,
uh,

220
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.080
the lady was like,
Oh God.

221
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:31.760
And they're like,
okay.

222
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.540
And The lady comes over when we're at the bar and she's like,
I'm sorry,
this,

223
00:15:35.541 --> 00:15:38.390
this and that,
but we,
you know,
I'm sorry.
And he goes,
no problem.

224
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:42.050
But as we're leaving,
another lady goes,
Mister crusher,

225
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:47.450
we were able to accommodate.
So and so's waiting.
So as we're leaving the lounge,

226
00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.230
another lady goes,
uh Oh,
um,
you're,

227
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.140
you know Mr Chrysler can I,
he followed me.

228
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:59.470
Then she opens the door and we walked down the tarmac and we go into a Cadillac

229
00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:04.130
and they drive.
Yeah,
they drive us to the remote terminal.

230
00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.800
Then we,
oh wait another couple of drinks at that bar.

231
00:16:09.801 --> 00:16:13.580
He was a separate bar there at the terminal at by the plane?
No,

232
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.010
it's a separate terminal.

233
00:16:16.011 --> 00:16:19.040
So like we were at terminal four both flying out of terminal six.

234
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:21.643
Yeah.

235
00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:26.120
And there's more drinks and more drinks there for you versus Burke.

236
00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.190
Well I've had one at the first lounge,

237
00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.880
but it's nine o'clock in the morning or something.
So you have [inaudible].

238
00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.120
How did that,
did it feel really know?
The first one is like,
it's like,

239
00:16:35.121 --> 00:16:39.710
it just feels like this isn't good,
but you know,
I was also,

240
00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.930
I also approached it with like,
today's a fun day.

241
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:45.050
I'm going to do whatever I'm with Bert,
I'm just going to do whatever.

242
00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.580
So he's like,
are you filming nursing?
Nothing.
Like he's like a college kid,
right?

243
00:16:49.581 --> 00:16:54.230
Yeah.
So as we're leaving that I tipped the guy,

244
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:58.700
I the guy and uh,
I think most people don't tip or something.
He was like,

245
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.430
thanks man.
He goes,
Hey,
do you want a couple to go?

246
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:05.510
As I'm saying like I'm good birds like dope.
He fucking great.

247
00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.080
So the guy makes us to to go on a coffee cup,

248
00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:14.810
hands it to us and virtually fucking perfect.
Yeah.

249
00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:19.520
We bored with our coffee cups with vodka sodas.
We Aye.

250
00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:23.150
Aye.
I fucking nurse that.
When I think for the whole flight he finishes,

251
00:17:23.151 --> 00:17:27.610
it has a couple more.
So now he's up to like six or something.
Anyways,

252
00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:33.800
I would go to the hospital if I drink.
So we land,
we go to the hotel,

253
00:17:33.801 --> 00:17:38.480
we have lunch,
vodka,
sodas for line with food obviously this time.

254
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:40.070
And then I go like,
wait,
I need it.

255
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.360
Like let's just take a chill pill till it's time to leave for the game.

256
00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.180
We do that,
we go to the game.

257
00:17:47.181 --> 00:17:51.390
The game ends up being a complete fucking blowout.
Like what does that mean?

258
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:52.860
Uh,
like I was,

259
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:56.390
I wanted to see a really competitive game because the two great teams,
right?

260
00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:58.440
But w golden state,

261
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.100
Oakland basically destroyed Cleveland.

262
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:06.720
I saw this on social media.
Oh my God.
It was a total blur,

263
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:08.700
but it was still really fun.

264
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:13.620
We had amazing seats that Rogan hooked up.
So nice fourth row.

265
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.450
I'm just absolutely,
you know,

266
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.420
we got to see like these legendary players in PR,

267
00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:22.920
like fucking right there playing.
Uh,
we had a lot of fun,

268
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.860
had a lot of laughs.
And then from there we went,
oh,

269
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:30.110
we go back to the hotel as we're getting back in the car.
He goes,
which is what?

270
00:18:30.111 --> 00:18:33.900
My second wind and I go,
my wind is dead.
I need to lay down.

271
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.620
Because even at the game I didn't drink anything at the game.

272
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.710
He didn't neither did he actually,
no,
we smoked a little before Wednesday then.

273
00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:46.170
But I thought for a minute you guys were sober for now.
No,
nothing.
But he's like,

274
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.380
I just hit my second one.
I don't even know how that's possible.
But,

275
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:54.480
so he goes to the bar and I go to the room and I lay in the room with the lights

276
00:18:54.481 --> 00:18:58.230
off for like an hour,
maybe an hour and a half.
I go down,

277
00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:03.780
then we go to dinner.
We go to the house of prime rib is a friend of his,

278
00:19:03.781 --> 00:19:07.890
set it up,
a chef,
a legendary,
legendary spot.
Yeah.
It's really fun.

279
00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:13.350
They're really fun.
Um,
we have this great meal.
We eat,
we go off the rails,

280
00:19:13.351 --> 00:19:16.080
you know,
we're off the diets and everything and I honestly,

281
00:19:16.081 --> 00:19:19.260
it didn't feel as good as I thought it was going to feel to go off the Diet

282
00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.350
because it was too much food.
Yeah.

283
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:26.450
Like it was just enormous portions.
Yeah.
Uh,
I mean,
it should taste good,

284
00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.190
don't get me wrong.
But afterwards you're like,
oh my God.
Yeah.

285
00:19:29.191 --> 00:19:30.550
Because when you're used to feeling,

286
00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:35.490
getting to the point of being disgustingly full anymore and now it's
destructive.

287
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:40.800
Hmm.
Don't get me wrong.
It was a familiar feeling.
I've done it many times,

288
00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:46.620
but we were just completely stuffed.
Yeah.
Then we go back.

289
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.990
He rates his mini bar.
Um,
we smoked cigars,
Ellen the balcony,

290
00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.840
and then this is the best part.

291
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.920
So the next morning we get,
uh,

292
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.890
they get picked up and go to the airport.

293
00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:07.590
Immediately we go to the lounge and he's like a vodka soda to the guy.

294
00:20:10.501 --> 00:20:15.270
He's like,
Tom,
I go,
I'm having coffee.
Because like,
I'm already like,
I need,

295
00:20:15.271 --> 00:20:20.271
I can tell I need a full day to get over his craziness and like his normal way

296
00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:24.960
of traveling.
Yeah.
Dude,
it's right back.
He's not,

297
00:20:24.961 --> 00:20:27.960
he's right back into partying is what you're saying.
Yeah.
Not even partying,

298
00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.740
just like,
let's get on a plane.
So,
so resilient.
Yeah.

299
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:36.270
By the time we land in La,
right before noon,

300
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.310
he's eight deep wow.
And totally normal.
We'll see.

301
00:20:41.311 --> 00:20:46.311
That's the interesting part about barked Chrysler is that drinking doesn't him?

302
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.610
<v 0>No.
It's so weird.
Cracking jokes.
He's the best.</v>

303
00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.870
He's just like having fun.
That's the part of this whole thing that you're like,

304
00:20:55.871 --> 00:20:59.440
well,
is it so bad?
Two hours later,
I still don't feel good.

305
00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.510
Well now you're sick.
Now you're coming down with a cold.
But,
uh,
it doesn't,

306
00:21:04.511 --> 00:21:07.780
it just makes him,
he's already an awesome dude.

307
00:21:07.781 --> 00:21:10.030
Like he's so sweet and fun and lovable,

308
00:21:10.031 --> 00:21:13.900
and then he drinks and he gets more sweet and fun and lovable.
Becomes more fun.

309
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:17.800
Never Morose.
Never solen never angry.
No,

310
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:22.480
he's just like party Rad.
It's really,
really so weird.

311
00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:27.250
Um,
I don't want it.
He plays up.
He always plays a,

312
00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:32.230
what's it called?
He bought,
he always plays music in his videos that he posts.

313
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:36.310
So I can't really,
but like just this is us.
Go look at different,

314
00:21:36.311 --> 00:21:39.730
he looks with no beard.
I know.
It looked like he looks like a younger man.

315
00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:44.530
Actually.
That's us.
Yeah.
We're just,
Oh,
there is.
Okay.
Um,

316
00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.850
so yeah,
this is Tommy.
You look great.
This is what's going down so crazy.

317
00:21:48.851 --> 00:21:52.030
Look how good you look.
Jeans.
Oh good.
Look how skinny your face.

318
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.420
You look fantastic.
You look,

319
00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.880
it's definitely better than a three months ago

320
00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:06.820
of Avaya Soda.
Is that the girl you guys bang.
We'd doubled team.

321
00:22:06.821 --> 00:22:10.510
That girl on the tarmac.
You guys put her in the Hammock.

322
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:14.980
We put her in the,
in the fucking the best.

323
00:22:14.981 --> 00:22:19.330
Is that you and I went to the dentist and we did it the day you landed.

324
00:22:19.331 --> 00:22:23.350
And what a Burt say to you about going to the dentist?
He,
Oh,
I go,
oh my God,

325
00:22:23.351 --> 00:22:27.150
this is the best.
So we're in,
we're in,
uh,

326
00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:30.850
in the morning on the way back.
I go,
I've got to go to the dentist today.

327
00:22:30.851 --> 00:22:34.960
Who are you serious?
Oh my gosh,
look how many people are there.

328
00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:39.490
I know it's crazy.
And I go,
yeah,

329
00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:44.970
sometimes I think I know you.
And I go,

330
00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:48.030
what are you talking about?
Cause you take care of your teeth.

331
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:52.930
Don't cause I'm going to a dog.
And I go,
okay,
why?
And he goes,
look,

332
00:22:52.931 --> 00:22:56.320
a bird.
I took a picture of him.
Stones.
I took a

333
00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:02.590
couple of skinny bears.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Holy hands.

334
00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:04.640
She's those belong to,
uh,

335
00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:08.260
I'll ask if you guys are going to share a room and then share a bed.
And he said,

336
00:23:08.261 --> 00:23:11.910
you're going to do the s where one guy stays on top of the sheet,
stays on.

337
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:16.720
That was pretty funny.
So he goes,
I don't even know you.
And I go,

338
00:23:16.721 --> 00:23:20.300
what are you talking happening here babe?
That's Bert I get is junk.

339
00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:23.980
I know by the way.
Like no,
he took the pictures himself.

340
00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.010
How he put it on the self timer thing.
I got to learn.

341
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:33.330
That's really funny.
So I know everybody does believe me.

342
00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:36.270
Wow.
It's quite a weekend.
Quite a night guys.

343
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:40.960
So I go,
why do you not know me?
He's like,
when he's traveling,

344
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:44.620
I would never go to the,
I would never do anything like that.

345
00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:46.100
It would never go to a doctor.

346
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.750
<v 5>If I travel,
I don't do anything.
And then like 30 seconds later he's like,</v>

347
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:53.390
well go to Bhutan,
Papa's podcast today.
Right.

348
00:23:53.391 --> 00:23:55.960
And then later on these other guys are come over to podcast.
We'll go,

349
00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:00.050
so you are doing things today?
Yeah,
but not a doctor's appointment.
And you go,

350
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:04.320
okay.
So then I was,
he goes,
when's the last time you went to the dentist?
You Go,

351
00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:08.480
it's actually pretty bad.
It's probably like,
it's over a year for sure.

352
00:24:08.481 --> 00:24:13.080
And he's like,
Oh,
you want to know?
Last time I went to done it like,

353
00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:16.700
oh one,
I don't know,
three years.
At least 10 years.

354
00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:20.830
<v 0>Oh my God.
Really?
And he listens to the show.
I know.</v>

355
00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.520
She should know better,
man.
We got to get on Leanne.

356
00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:29.340
<v 5>Yeah.
Uh,
do we have the dental update theme song anymore?</v>

357
00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.730
Of course.
But you just,
you just screwed up.
You know why?

358
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:37.080
Because you brought it up without letting me fucking prep that song.
You know,

359
00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:40.020
you get,
you do it all the time,
you know.

360
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:43.000
<v 0>Sorry.
How do not know?
I told you,</v>

361
00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:46.450
I told you I had a topic rundown and I told you we were going to do dental

362
00:24:46.451 --> 00:24:47.190
updates.
Yeah.

363
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:48.023
<v 5>You don't care.</v>

364
00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.170
<v 0>You're so grouchy today.
It's because you're not feeling well.
I know,</v>

365
00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.770
I know genes,
but you just,
we got to get through it.

366
00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.410
<v 5>You'll be okay.
I know,
I know.
I'm sending this right now.</v>

367
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.110
<v 0>Is it because Jack reacher was such a good movie last night?</v>

368
00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:07.340
<v 5>I'm honestly blown away at what happened.</v>

369
00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:08.340
<v 0>Okay.</v>

370
00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:13.020
We have to discuss the Jack reacher sequel after we do our dental updates.

371
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:17.830
<v 5>Uh,
cause I tabbed out about 30 minutes in.
It's,</v>

372
00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:19.460
it was really special.

373
00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.380
It is on fucking believe what happened.

374
00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.850
<v 0>Can I actually read an email while you're looking for the,</v>

375
00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:32.950
<v 5>um,
dental update music?
No.
Oh,
how long is it going to take you?</v>

376
00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:38.130
Oh Gosh.
Sorry if you're crouched tonight.
So fuck fucking

377
00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:41.373
God.

378
00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.090
<v 6>That's it.
Okay,
good.
I'm so excited.</v>

379
00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:58.500
So
that's all right.
Our

380
00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.830
<v 0>dental updates and he's like,
you know,</v>

381
00:25:59.831 --> 00:26:03.580
we haven't had a dental update in a long time.
Well,

382
00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:08.500
we correctly flog ourselves because we kept reading them and we've been talking

383
00:26:08.501 --> 00:26:12.310
about a lot how we haven't been in awhile.
We really haven't over a long time.

384
00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:16.030
Well,
it's,
yeah,
you're,
yes.
A year for me.
Almost.
Yeah.

385
00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.790
I think a little more for a little over a year.
Anyways,

386
00:26:18.791 --> 00:26:22.690
we went again and we took her,
we went back to back.
Well,

387
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:25.930
we got a recommendation for a new dentist.
Yeah.
Because we moved,

388
00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:29.170
you guys have to go and I gotta tell you I'm jumping ahead,

389
00:26:29.171 --> 00:26:32.840
but there's nothing like that post cleaning.
It's so clean now still.
Yeah.

390
00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:36.970
And you have to spend money on the preventative end so that you don't end up

391
00:26:36.971 --> 00:26:39.700
spending $10,000 when it's right.
You know,

392
00:26:39.701 --> 00:26:44.550
gum grafts and whatever the canals and crap.
Don't do that.

393
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:45.990
No dental insurance.
Yeah we have.

394
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:50.790
We pay out of pocket was $200 for both of us to get her or proofs or foods

395
00:26:50.791 --> 00:26:55.650
cleaned.
You got to do it.
I mean dude my so go ahead.
Go ahead.

396
00:26:55.651 --> 00:26:59.380
You went first to go ahead.
Well I went first because we went back to bag.
Yeah.

397
00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:04.830
And he tells me,
cause this is the first time we'd been to the dentist,

398
00:27:04.831 --> 00:27:06.150
so they do a full exam,

399
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.270
they check your gums for it and they check your mouth for mouth cancer.

400
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:13.080
They check your,
your gums for bleeding,
this health,

401
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:14.610
the health fullness of your gums.

402
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:19.350
And so the assistant takes down numbers and he says anything one,

403
00:27:19.351 --> 00:27:24.351
two or three is considered normal and they go through every single gum area.

404
00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:29.910
And all I heard,
all I heard was one,
one,
one,

405
00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:34.650
one,
one,
two,
two,
two,
one,
one,
one,
one maybe like two,

406
00:27:34.651 --> 00:27:37.260
three is around my crowns.
That's not my fault.

407
00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:42.000
And he did the cleaning.
It was so quick for me,
you know,

408
00:27:42.001 --> 00:27:46.050
I just laid down.
It was done.
And then I,
I asked him,

409
00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:49.830
I asked him,
would you marry your mom and I,
and he and I will know.

410
00:27:49.831 --> 00:27:53.430
And I asked him,
I go,
in all seriousness,
if you had to grade my teeth,

411
00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:57.030
the condition of my mouth today,
what would you give me as a letter grade?

412
00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:02.370
And he kind of chuckled and he said a,
did he really?
He did.

413
00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.850
He gave me an a,
now I lied to you.
And I said a plus.
I was joking,

414
00:28:05.851 --> 00:28:09.780
but he did give me an a and he goes,
you'd very little plaque.
He goes,

415
00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.550
you've no stains.

416
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.990
And My stoma teeth look like they're in great condition.
I said,
thank you.

417
00:28:15.991 --> 00:28:19.540
You know why?
Because I floss every day.
And he said,
I can tell.
He said that.

418
00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:22.350
He said,
I can tell now,
here's the one thing that sucks.

419
00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.110
I'm going to have to Redo one of the crowns that I have.

420
00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:27.780
That doesn't sound like a no,
it's not my fault.

421
00:28:27.781 --> 00:28:30.000
It's because the dentist that did it the first time,

422
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:35.340
he didn't line it up properly on the gum line and I'm having food caught in it

423
00:28:35.341 --> 00:28:38.490
and that can be infected.
Even though that's been root canal,

424
00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:43.510
I have to replace the crown so that it's flush with the uh,
other teeth.
Okay.

425
00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:46.140
Not My fault.
Sounds like a made up story.

426
00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:50.100
It's a story it sounds made.
I think people listening are like,

427
00:28:50.101 --> 00:28:53.100
well that sounds like a made up story.
Why would I make that up?

428
00:28:53.101 --> 00:28:57.300
Hey you have an a also,
you need a lot of work done and it's a lot.
I said,

429
00:28:57.301 --> 00:29:01.600
one crown replaced that's through no fault of my own faulty,
faulty crown.

430
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.620
How would you grade this house?
And they go,

431
00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.920
I would say it's an a now we're going to need a tear down that foundation.

432
00:29:07.921 --> 00:29:11.130
You want to call a doctor right now and ask him what my letter grade was?

433
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.390
Let's call him right now.
He said a yeah.

434
00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.460
And then you got in the chair and I said,

435
00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:22.110
I'm going to apologize for my husband and advanced cause he's got filthy dog

436
00:29:22.111 --> 00:29:25.200
teeth that need cleaning.
But it doesn't seem like a cool thing.

437
00:29:25.201 --> 00:29:29.820
So what was your experience like in the chair,
Tom?
Going right away.
First of all,

438
00:29:29.821 --> 00:29:32.640
I liked that they got down to business right away.
There was very little waiting.

439
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:37.650
Sometimes it's like doesn't lag.
Oh,
he's just with someone.
I hate that.
Hate that.

440
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.900
He got right on it.
He got too,

441
00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:46.650
I forgot like first he does the drill where they just clean in between.

442
00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.880
And then the second part is the hello.
I got a totally different treatment.

443
00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:55.420
My teeth weren't covered in plaque.
Yeah,
well anyways,

444
00:29:55.421 --> 00:30:00.250
my teeth were like a little sensitive and I was like,
Ooh,
that's felt.
And uh,

445
00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:04.060
afterwards I got home,
I put my teeth were more sensitive.
He goes,

446
00:30:04.061 --> 00:30:08.320
I really cranked it up for you.
And I go,
okay.
And I said,

447
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:13.400
yeah,
if you had to marry your mom,
no.
I said,
what?

448
00:30:13.401 --> 00:30:18.200
What would,
uh,
what would you grade mine?
No,
you did not ask it.
Yeah.

449
00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:22.380
He goes easily a plus,
Blah.
He goes,
hey,

450
00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:25.810
said in a generation of noticing better teeth.
That's what he said.

451
00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:29.320
I don't think he did because I was there.

452
00:30:29.321 --> 00:30:32.020
And I could overhear what you guys were saying and I didn't hear that.
Yeah,

453
00:30:32.021 --> 00:30:36.490
he did.
He said that.
No he didn't.
He said in all my time,

454
00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:38.320
I've never seen a better set of teeth.

455
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:42.670
How much did your gums bleed during your cleaning done?
Are you sure?

456
00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:46.830
I'm positive.
They do look so much wider right now.

457
00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:48.203
Like mile.

458
00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:56.470
Yeah,
they're really nice.

459
00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:00.370
Can I tell you something stupid that I've been doing that you and I have been

460
00:31:00.371 --> 00:31:04.930
doing together that I just,
it just occurred to me how dumb.
So every,

461
00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:09.220
every day you and I have this routine where we go to bar stocks in the afternoon

462
00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:14.200
and I get an iced Tall Americano with a splash of half and half.

463
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:15.063
Yeah.

464
00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:19.690
Well I do it because I figure it's a cold drink and I can drink through a straw

465
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:23.620
and the straw will protect my veneers from getting stained with coffee.

466
00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:26.560
I think like Rachel's,
Oh,
does that or something.

467
00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:30.760
But what I didn't really put together for the last two months,

468
00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:34.330
every time I drink that drink,
it hurts my stomach so bad.

469
00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:39.800
Like it hurts and it's too strong a copy and it makes me angry and anxious and I

470
00:31:41.471 --> 00:31:45.280
get like really,
really fucking crazy on it.

471
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:50.310
This reminds me of not having an outlet for the plugin to blood.

472
00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:55.540
Yeah,
exactly.
Exactly.
It's like I,
I keep drinking it.

473
00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:57.380
I know it hurts cause they've been amazing.

474
00:31:57.381 --> 00:32:01.150
And then why don't I just order something else?
I would do that for years too.

475
00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:05.770
For years.
What is that?
But why?
Why do we do this to ourselves?

476
00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:10.930
It's just shows you how our brains work.
It's like
this is my drink,

477
00:32:10.931 --> 00:32:12.000
this is what I order,

478
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:19.250
keeps hurting.
And then I keep doing it because it's,

479
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:22.870
the thing is when I order a hot drink,
it doesn't hurt my stomach.
Yeah.

480
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:24.580
It doesn't give me that.

481
00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:28.210
So what I should be doing is ordering a hot drink and just drinking with a
straw.

482
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:29.063
Yeah.
Hello?

483
00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.640
Yeah.
If it's,

484
00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:41.000
especially if it's affecting your stomach hurts so much and I always just like

485
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.270
chalk it up to light.
Well that's coffee.
That's coffee for you.

486
00:32:44.271 --> 00:32:47.440
I guess it just hurts.
Your stomach will love it.

487
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:56.400
What have you done that with,
besides the outlets?
Those totes.
Oh,

488
00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:57.500
I got a little bar.

489
00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:02.780
Remember for the longest time we only had like one iPhone charger in the house.

490
00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:05.000
Yeah.
We're like,
wait,
we can buy to

491
00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:11.360
my back.
Why wouldn't it?
You just have them around the house all the time.

492
00:33:11.361 --> 00:33:15.700
Right there,
right.
Yeah,
of course.
Cause you just lose them by a few.

493
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:18.200
<v 5>Um,
yeah,
I've done that with a lot of things.</v>

494
00:33:18.201 --> 00:33:22.160
Like I don't like the way that tastes good.
Again,
we don't one time.

495
00:33:22.161 --> 00:33:24.260
The worst one I ever did was,
I don't think you remember this.

496
00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:29.240
We went to a family dinner in Florida.
We were visiting,

497
00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:32.450
we went to some Italian place,
which wasn't the norm for,
Oh yeah,

498
00:33:32.451 --> 00:33:35.540
your dad hates Italian food.
I know.
Well I ordered a soup,

499
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:39.200
which I don't normally do.
Yeah.
And I took a bite and I'm not,

500
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:43.700
I'm not exaggerating when I say this.
It tasted like vomit.

501
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:48.410
It tasted like when you remember this restaurant,
I remember her.

502
00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.980
I remember smelling it and it's like,
yeah.

503
00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:56.340
And it's like when you taste vomit on the way up,
and you know what I did,

504
00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:59.150
I had a second.
But yeah,

505
00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:04.690
it's like I didn't trust my own reaction to it.

506
00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:09.830
Right,
right.
And then as I was about to take a third bite doing,

507
00:34:09.890 --> 00:34:14.660
I go,
I see what is this?
I don't know.
That's the blah blah blah suit.
And I go,

508
00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:19.190
this is horrible.
Horrible me.
Like I was like,

509
00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:22.310
I don't think you understand what type of horror I'm talking.

510
00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:24.150
I really thought somebody vomited

511
00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:28.510
<v 0>and I remembered the suit because you had me smell it and you know my</v>

512
00:34:28.511 --> 00:34:31.840
sensitivity.
I go,
that's terrible.

513
00:34:31.841 --> 00:34:34.480
That is the bomb vomit in a bowl and smelled like,

514
00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:40.300
and it was served to us in a restaurant,
but I'm talking about like longterm,

515
00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:44.110
like right now the toothpaste,
the aqua fresh that I ordered on Amazon,

516
00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:49.340
it's not the right one,
but because I ordered like six tubes I keep,

517
00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:52.420
I just insist on using it.
That fucking whatever you got.

518
00:34:52.421 --> 00:34:57.040
And I hate the taste too.
And I keep using,
I'll just power through it.

519
00:34:57.041 --> 00:35:00.760
Like I should just throw it away.
It's $10 where the toothpaste,
it's unreal.

520
00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.550
The immigrant in me doesn't want to like

521
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:08.810
<v 5>given,
you know,
of course,
and maybe it's the immigrant thing.
Oh God.</v>

522
00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:13.070
God,
nothing.
I'll never forget that fucking thing.

523
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:18.500
The vomit soup I remember and I remember that night.
Yeah.
Pretty bad.

524
00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:22.450
<v 0>Bye.
Wait,
you did not get an a on your teeth and I know you got a d minus.</v>

525
00:35:22.451 --> 00:35:25.830
Thank you.
Asked them,
will you ever date your mom?

526
00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:30.610
You know what's funny about that clip?
The audience doesn't think it's funny.

527
00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:35.440
I don't think that's true.
We never got much feedback on ass.
When you're married,

528
00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:38.320
<v 5>you think it just bothersome?
Yeah.</v>

529
00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:42.980
<v 0>My feeling is because the feedback is pretty strong on all our bits.
Yeah.</v>

530
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:46.610
Like zero feedback on this one,
but it's just like the gays.

531
00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:51.080
But I do get that written in a lot of things I post.
Yeah.
Can I hear her again?

532
00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:56.060
Uh,
I asked him,
asked him,
will you ever date your mom so weird.

533
00:35:56.570 --> 00:36:01.120
Once in a while he calls me mom.
You know what I mean?
Yeah,
yeah.
I know.

534
00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:06.220
Jimmying those rule kills.
Yeah.
Those are really,
he loves his company.

535
00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:07.423
Somebody else?

536
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:10.870
<v 5>No,
it wasn't the same gloves will let me get to this mommy lady today.</v>

537
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:12.570
You want to see this?
Yeah.

538
00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:17.110
So apparently what's happening here is that the lady recording isn't it parking

539
00:36:17.111 --> 00:36:21.400
lot?
Um,
and she,
she is,

540
00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:23.050
has a child in the back.

541
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:29.110
I guess the other lady who you see who you heard in the opening?

542
00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:32.830
Yeah.
Calls her up and is like,
you know,

543
00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:37.860
calling her attention and then accuses her of abusing the kid cause she's

544
00:36:38.231 --> 00:36:40.790
tweezing her eyebrows while driving.
But I right,

545
00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:45.460
I mean everything leads you to believe that the lady tweezing her eyebrows is

546
00:36:45.461 --> 00:36:48.650
not doing anything wrong day.
Your mom,

547
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:51.910
this lady is just out of her fucking Milan probably.
Yeah.

548
00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:57.040
It's usually how it goes on the show.
Oh,
hold on.

549
00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:01.730
<v 4>At my son's soccer games to cute dog and this crazy stuff.</v>

550
00:37:01.731 --> 00:37:06.530
So I was sitting here
at my son's soccer games.

551
00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:12.650
Lady is yelling at me because I was walking.
My eyebrow mean,

552
00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:14.880
do we know,
scream at me mommy

553
00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:22.540
children plucking my eyebrows to scream at me,

554
00:37:23.181 --> 00:37:27.810
mommy,
me,
mommy.
What?
Abuse Schema.

555
00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:34.340
<v 5>Yeah.
It's like she's just pulls it out of nowhere.
Yeah.</v>

556
00:37:34.341 --> 00:37:37.270
Stay out of her fucking mind.
I always think about when I see something like,

557
00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.310
like for instance,
this club that that lady can drive.
Yeah.

558
00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:43.370
And she has a cute dog.
Yeah.
But the driving part.
Yeah.

559
00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:45.780
<v 0>Well,
what about endangering your dog?
You dumb bitch.</v>

560
00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:47.970
I never drive with my dogs on my lap.

561
00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:51.170
<v 4>Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?</v>

562
00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.380
I am fucking

563
00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:58.860
child to the advocacy.
Correct.

564
00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:02.770
<v 5>That's very made up.
Right.</v>

565
00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:06.560
<v 4>And what's your deal with me?
Do not abuse you off too,</v>

566
00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:08.980
because I sat here waiting on my son's soccer game,

567
00:38:08.981 --> 00:38:11.620
plucking my eyebrows because you hit him.

568
00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:16.320
I hit my son and him and you hit and you screamed.

569
00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:21.750
Really?
I hit my kids,
Jordan,
do I hate you?
Oh,
did I sit here and hate,

570
00:38:21.751 --> 00:38:25.180
you know,
I was plucking my eyebrows lady

571
00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:29.600
<v 0>and she's like,
oh my God.</v>

572
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:34.020
<v 5>Geez.
So she's like totally gaslighting or too,
you know?
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

573
00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.160
That's crazy that somebody would say that about

574
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:40.810
<v 0>you realize that anybody says that to everybody else starts off believing them.</v>

575
00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:44.710
Well,
it's a pretty serious accusation.
That's what I'm saying.
Jesus.
It's like a,

576
00:38:44.711 --> 00:38:47.560
if you make a rape accusation,
people don't,
you know,

577
00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:51.490
the immediate thought is like,
oh,
that person's a rapist.
You know,

578
00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.860
not like really I the even,
yeah,
you're right.

579
00:38:53.861 --> 00:38:57.640
Just the stink of the accusations can take you down.
So this lady's like,

580
00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:00.520
you beat your children.
I mean,
if people hear that and they go,
Hey,

581
00:39:00.521 --> 00:39:02.840
are you hitting your kid?
That's crazy.
That's cool.

582
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:06.390
<v 4>Crazy.
I don't care what y'all seconds.
Tom says,</v>

583
00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.950
I was born.
How?

584
00:39:08.951 --> 00:39:13.951
Yo Baby Daddy knew why to town my babies hit the children.

585
00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:20.040
<v 0>I mean,
it's really a totally Luna Tech Person.
Yeah.</v>

586
00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:23.660
Pass them.
Will you ever date your mom?
My May.

587
00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:24.943
<v 4>No,</v>

588
00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:33.160
she looks,
I hit my kid
eyebrows.

589
00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:36.780
Chill.
Drink

590
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:45.110
<v 0>so fucking,
so it's like,
uh,
someone who's delusional.</v>

591
00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:49.520
Just could be a,
she could be drunk.
Oh,
right,
I see.
I don't know.

592
00:39:49.521 --> 00:39:53.540
Mental illness.
Yeah.
It could be a many things going on,
but I liked it.

593
00:39:53.541 --> 00:39:54.920
She calls her mummy.
I liked it.

594
00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:59.420
So maybe she saw her plucking and eyebrow like shifting a children navy.

595
00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:02.440
Maybe she had a few.
Yeah.
And she sees what she wants to hear.

596
00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:04.160
It sounds like there could be some booze in that role.

597
00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:05.510
Usually it's a little slurry.
Yeah.

598
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:15.460
<v 4>Yo Yo chill</v>

599
00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.750
shit to say.

600
00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.930
<v 0>You know what,
this reminds me of.
Whoa.</v>

601
00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:29.180
I beginning to doubt your commitment to sparkle motion type,

602
00:40:29.641 --> 00:40:33.540
right?
Yeah.
And Donnie Darko.
Yes.
She's the,
you know,

603
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:37.860
the big child advocate,
the absolute dance mom.
Oh my God.

604
00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:41.640
Now that was an English accent and I wanted to,
um,

605
00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:46.370
last week we did the roadman accent.
Yes.
And we,

606
00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:49.730
I asked what is,
oh,
I see the little road.

607
00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:53.640
Muna asked them,
will you ever date your mom?
Yeah.

608
00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:58.970
So Rodman is the UK equivalent of homies from the hood in the u s the reason

609
00:40:59.251 --> 00:41:04.251
they call them roadman is because in London slang to be in the area slash hoods

610
00:41:04.601 --> 00:41:08.010
slash on the street,
they say,
are you on road?

611
00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.700
It has only recently become a popular term in the last few years because of UK

612
00:41:11.701 --> 00:41:13.680
hip hop and grime music.

613
00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:17.970
Cockney has almost but disappeared from London and has been replaced by roadman

614
00:41:17.971 --> 00:41:20.910
dialect.
Very interesting.
Very interesting.

615
00:41:20.911 --> 00:41:23.100
Another person explains Ben from England,

616
00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:26.520
predominantly London phrase to describe usually a young male who dresses in

617
00:41:26.521 --> 00:41:28.260
track suits and trainers.

618
00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:32.190
Never high and tight jeans usually found patrolling as local neighborhood.

619
00:41:32.191 --> 00:41:34.040
Being involved in illegal activity,

620
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:38.450
<v 5>usually connected to drug dealing closely related to London.
Wrap grime culture.</v>

621
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:43.160
Keep Glassy Ben Glass.
Yeah,
I like that.
It's money.
Well,

622
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:46.700
there you go.
There you go.
Um,

623
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:50.220
so much more here.
Uh,

624
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:54.170
you recall a few weeks ago we had,

625
00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:59.150
remember the,
the guy who taught you how to do a threesome.

626
00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:05.150
The Charlatan,
that fucking guy fucking thumb rings and the Pony Tail,

627
00:42:05.151 --> 00:42:10.040
you know,
has it shit.
Twin goddesses.
How to hug clips.
I'm blind.

628
00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:11.840
He put out how to hug.
First of all,

629
00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.000
you know that you didn't see those two girls last time.

630
00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.330
They're laying on their backs of,
there are a couple of dogs.
Probably.

631
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:20.420
They're way more attractive than I didn't think they were dogs.

632
00:42:20.421 --> 00:42:23.000
I thought they were cute.
Really?
How could you tell?
Well,

633
00:42:23.001 --> 00:42:24.350
I could just see he's couldn't see.

634
00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:29.210
You couldn't see their face when God is activation.
No,
no faces.

635
00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.120
I guess you were really paying attention.

636
00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:35.670
<v 7>You're awake,
cuter.
He can see her test,
test,
test,
test.</v>

637
00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:44.570
<v 5>This thing drives me nuts.
What?</v>

638
00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:49.730
When the fuck did this heart with your hand thing start and it's so fucking lame

639
00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:54.180
and it makes me cringe whenever I see some dumb dumb do it.

640
00:42:54.181 --> 00:42:55.800
Who is stupid commercial?
I hate it.

641
00:42:56.350 --> 00:43:00.210
They make shitty jewelry and they go like one side open.

642
00:43:00.211 --> 00:43:04.590
So that your heart then?
Yeah,
it's like a heart design irritates me.

643
00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:06.990
Every kiss begins with Kay.

644
00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:12.510
Is that the one where the celebrity designs the heart jewelry?
She's like

645
00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:18.190
not k's but the yeah,
the open one side.
Yes.

646
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:23.310
11 to your heart.
But the heart with the hand thing.
I'm so over it.

647
00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:27.180
But these girls are pretty,
no,
no,
no.
Hold on.
The one on the left is,

648
00:43:27.181 --> 00:43:31.160
and you can see her nips.
Nips or tips or fake huge Baker.
Yeah,

649
00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:35.880
but I mean she's pretty,
but the one on the right,
do you think she's pretty

650
00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:42.130
much prettier now?
The one in the middle.
He is such a fucking douchebag.

651
00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:45.620
Fucking roof.
Fuck.
Is he wearing,
he's such a Douche.

652
00:43:45.621 --> 00:43:48.630
She's got all these bracelets.
Any more sheer clothing.

653
00:43:48.631 --> 00:43:52.630
And any more gold jewelry on,
it's the bangles on a man.
Oh,

654
00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:56.580
bangle bracelets really make me want to vomit.
I mean,

655
00:43:56.610 --> 00:43:59.390
I hope that there's a lot of drugs involved in all their choices.

656
00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:15.350
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

657
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.920
such

658
00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:29.860
<v 5>fucking throat.
Yeah.
And first of all,</v>

659
00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:32.070
anybody approaches you and hugs you like that.
I mean,

660
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.070
<v 0>they're hands on your hips.
Are you Outta your mind?
It's the Trump hug.</v>

661
00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:36.270
That's how he hugs his girl.

662
00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:40.420
<v 7>Daughter of serious.
He Hugs Ivanka.</v>

663
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:44.140
So they're waiting to do a third I kiss,

664
00:44:44.141 --> 00:44:46.580
which is please don't

665
00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:51.730
do this at least three times a minute.

666
00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:56.580
<v 0>Taking deep breaths together with them and they say,
this is how you should,
uh,</v>

667
00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:01.370
uh,
an intimate lover.
Not just this isn't for your lover.
I Dunno.
Oh,

668
00:45:01.371 --> 00:45:03.560
I think you got a hug.
Yeah.
Feed those.
Teddy's,

669
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:08.720
by the way,
somebody just emailed us asking,

670
00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:13.840
what do you call small sloppers cause they say that they enjoy our big slopper

671
00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:17.390
terms.
So what would you call a tee?
A pair of high and tights like this.
Oh,

672
00:45:17.391 --> 00:45:19.610
those are hungry.
Hungry test.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

673
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:21.110
They're hungry because they need to be fed.

674
00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:25.700
You gotta keep giving spoonfuls to those days.
Keep gaining some weight.
Yeah.

675
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:32.390
Can I tell you something?
If you were this,
uh,
passionate with me,

676
00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:36.080
we went last of course.
Like it's so uncomfortable.
Well,

677
00:45:36.081 --> 00:45:38.960
so the thing about this level of passion doesn't last with anyone.

678
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:41.690
It's all about that NRA new relationship.
Yeah.

679
00:45:41.691 --> 00:45:45.200
You can't stay like this with someone for years.
It's absurd.

680
00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:50.390
And I feel like maybe you could manufacture it like they do on that show.

681
00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:52.760
Yeah.
The polyamorous.
Yeah.
Bad.

682
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:56.030
Because what he's actually excited about is that he ends up fucking somebody

683
00:45:56.031 --> 00:46:00.590
else.
Course.
It was awesome.
It was like,
yeah,
fuck somebody else.
Oh yeah.

684
00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:04.860
<v 7>Yeah.
This is
why you should,</v>

685
00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:07.290
this is how they would say hello.

686
00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:11.163
Hello.

687
00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:16.550
<v 0>Got It.
This sounds a little annoying,
but do you see,
um,
how they're saying hello?</v>

688
00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:21.680
It's not like I can't just get a stranger like that.
God,

689
00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:24.890
I can't take,
just want to see how much more inappropriate it gets.

690
00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:27.400
That's the only thing I want to see because this is not us.

691
00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:29.900
<v 7>Hi Sharon.</v>

692
00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.730
So then the next call.

693
00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:42.280
<v 0>Oh,
so that was just,
that was the pre,
how's the prep buildup?</v>

694
00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:43.450
Hands on the hips.

695
00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:47.830
<v 8>Uh,</v>

696
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:49.260
<v 0>I love you.
I'm grateful for you.</v>

697
00:46:49.810 --> 00:46:54.090
<v 7>Oh,
you to hold each other at a deep connected depot.
Coded</v>

698
00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:59.750
the other person writing the Phoenix rates here at

699
00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:05.020
ease into that hub.
We're going to hold here.

700
00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:09.180
So what's wrong with these people?
I remember

701
00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:12.030
<v 0>in high school that one kid,
I won't say his name,
every,</v>

702
00:47:12.031 --> 00:47:14.990
every high school had that kid that hug girls too long.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

703
00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:17.860
And it's the guy who's job it is to be the hugger.
Like the,

704
00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:22.230
was yours named John too?
Yeah,
it was like this kid who was always,

705
00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:25.290
he would always see him like that dude's always hugging a chick.

706
00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:30.250
He was always giving shoulder rubs.
He's a guy that likes to cuddle.
I know.

707
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.610
Giving those shows.
No,
just cuddle.
Come.
Let's just cuddle.
Come over and of,

708
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:38.150
what do you think's going on with these types in life?
Yeah.
What,

709
00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:39.910
but what is the deal with people,

710
00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:44.690
this time of personality that has to do everything meaningfully that like is

711
00:47:44.730 --> 00:47:47.290
that healthy or are they healthier than us is what I'm trying to say?

712
00:47:47.291 --> 00:47:49.120
Because I'm uncomfortable with that intimacy.

713
00:47:49.121 --> 00:47:52.180
I don't like that from a dude's perspective of a dude.

714
00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:55.660
I think it's always a guy just trying to get laid.
I think for,

715
00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:59.530
for a girl sometimes people are always looking for an identity.

716
00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:05.530
You can be the identity of the meaningful spiritual.
I got a lot of love to give.

717
00:48:05.531 --> 00:48:09.430
I have a lot of love to receive,
you know,
it becomes a lane I personality lane,

718
00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:11.470
like that's who I am and that's my thing.

719
00:48:11.471 --> 00:48:14.680
And then sometimes you see that person and maybe it does kind of affect your
day,

720
00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:15.880
you know?
It's like it can be pot.

721
00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:18.900
I think from a woman it can be positive like I've met.

722
00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:22.060
It's very healing for a woman to be like,
yeah,
women like that,
guys like that.

723
00:48:22.061 --> 00:48:26.020
I'm like,
all right,
well Sean bag.
Yeah.
See I go to,

724
00:48:26.021 --> 00:48:31.021
I see this massage therapist lady who's really talented and really good at what

725
00:48:31.871 --> 00:48:32.704
she does,

726
00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:37.300
but sometimes her sincerity makes me really uncomfortable.
Sure.

727
00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:41.710
And that level of like a part of it's because you're an elitist and what happens

728
00:48:41.711 --> 00:48:46.590
is what happens.
What happens is you're,

729
00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:51.080
you're actually in a,
an NRA.
No,
you're in a relationship.
Um,

730
00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:55.510
a particular relationship that you,
it's unspoken,

731
00:48:55.511 --> 00:48:58.540
but it's understood when you go there.
See,

732
00:48:58.541 --> 00:49:02.700
and what happens is when someone gets real sincere,
they're kind of a massage.

733
00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:03.873
Well,
you know,

734
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000
they're kind of breaking the protocol of that dynamic right there to be

735
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:13.750
basically taken care of.
And there's an exchange,
you know,
there's an agreement.

736
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:15.880
You,
you're paying for services.

737
00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:21.000
The person's supposed to not be like your technically your friend Sharman there.

738
00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:24.400
They're taking care of you.
So they become really sincere.

739
00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:29.470
It starts to break down the wall of,
oh,

740
00:49:29.471 --> 00:49:33.920
are you the person taking care of,
I pay you money,
give me a nice background.

741
00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:38.910
And they say things like,
oh,
you're having a wonderful day as well,

742
00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:41.300
cause she,
I don't like it.
Like,
you know,

743
00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:45.220
I'm going to touch your heart Chakra and you don't like that.
No.
Really?

744
00:49:45.221 --> 00:49:50.140
I thought you would like that.
It makes me crazy.
Uncomparable shockers.

745
00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:54.700
I like psychic things.
I like when she's like,
I like when she's like,

746
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.400
so I don't know if this means anything to you,

747
00:49:57.401 --> 00:50:02.230
but I had this energy of Wilma Flinstone.
I swear to God.

748
00:50:02.231 --> 00:50:03.460
She said that to me last time.

749
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:08.140
I don't know why does Wilma Flintstone mean anything to you?
And I go,
no.

750
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:11.470
Like I like that stuff,
but I don't like Shakara touches.

751
00:50:11.471 --> 00:50:16.400
I don't like healing touches.
I just makes me like,
ah hmm.

752
00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:21.130
But you've had that person before,
right?
Who gives the long meaningful hug?

753
00:50:21.131 --> 00:50:25.690
The sole hug.
Oh yeah.
It's so uncomfortable.
Yeah,
it is.
It is.

754
00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:29.600
I'm not into it.
I didn't know it either.
I do like a hug.
Yeah.
I like hugs.

755
00:50:29.601 --> 00:50:31.940
I like greeting people and saying buy likes.

756
00:50:31.941 --> 00:50:36.810
I just don't like the super intimate hug like a hippie.
Huck heavies.
Do I hate?

757
00:50:36.811 --> 00:50:40.400
It's too much.
Too much.
Not Comfortable.
You can greet me with a hug though.

758
00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:43.910
I like,
no,
I do too.
I'm a Hugger,
but I'm not like a soul hugger.

759
00:50:43.911 --> 00:50:47.360
Like these people are like,
this is absurd.
Meaningful hugs.
Yeah.

760
00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:50.540
100%.

761
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:54.530
This dude is not how I get it from the heart.

762
00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.800
He's talking from his hips right now.
Yeah.

763
00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:58.253
<v 7>Bono.</v>

764
00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:09.710
<v 0>This is just fucking stay.
Now I realize too,</v>

765
00:51:09.711 --> 00:51:13.120
this is more about even money because that's another workshop I teach.
You know?

766
00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:19.890
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

767
00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:34.070
<v 0>I'm leaking a little bit.
And then,
uh,
what about you</v>

768
00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:41.530
and a big tit hug like that from her and you're not noticing those big tits.

769
00:51:41.531 --> 00:51:44.920
I mentioned her mushy purples up against,
here's my favorite move from my gut.

770
00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:47.510
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Swinging his hair

771
00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:53.090
when he does this.
Oh,
that fake like,
yes,
yes.

772
00:51:53.091 --> 00:51:55.250
I'm so earnest and sincere.
Yes.

773
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:06.480
Yeah.
The women are sincere.

774
00:52:06.481 --> 00:52:09.740
The guy is just getting laid and the w as the Keller Oh,

775
00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:13.780
special type of guy who's always looking for an opening and a girl.

776
00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:17.070
Like for the girls that are like that,
like he's like,
I'm totally in the hugs.

777
00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:21.750
Super vulnerable into,
yeah,
I'm like the sole.
And then that girl was like,

778
00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:23.760
Oh really?
That's awesome.
You should come.

779
00:52:23.761 --> 00:52:26.640
And do this and then he's making next week some finger in these two girls

780
00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:30.810
and workshops.
That's a load of horse shit to

781
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:34.530
get high on your natural supply.

782
00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:39.030
Come pay $600 to sit through my fucking workshop.
That's a big racket.

783
00:52:39.031 --> 00:52:42.590
That workshops,
absolute fucking nonsense.
That's what that is.

784
00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.510
Just go see a shrink.
Go pay a shrink,

785
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:49.770
a lot more effective.
Go straight to the source.

786
00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:53.850
A vocal fry clip came.
Oh,
I love those.
Um,
let's see.

787
00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:58.350
I haven't actually seen this one.
Let's see.
Let me see here.

788
00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:08.220
<v 9>Terrified.
I'm going down.
I'm not going to</v>

789
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:14.690
<v 0>as you.
That is not my voice.
My voice.</v>

790
00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:16.020
What do you mean this not your voice?

791
00:53:16.021 --> 00:53:19.570
Because I know my own voice from when I was 20 this was submitted.
They said,

792
00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:24.140
oh that's an over voiceover.
It's not.
This is no good,

793
00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:26.070
<v 9>good stop.
Look like</v>

794
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:30.810
<v 0>that's me.
I was sick that day by the way.
I'm just terrified.
I'm going down,</v>

795
00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:36.080
but I'm not going to fall down and die.
That is not okay.

796
00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:40.280
So what happened there?
And the dogs
quiet.
Hey,

797
00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:46.670
okay.
If that is me,
it's cause I was sick with a fever when I was doing that.

798
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:52.950
That's not my voice though.
Cool.
It

799
00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:59.350
is not me.
You're the worst.
You're the worst.

800
00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:04.370
That's not me.
That's not my voice.
Sounds like you

801
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:08.210
recognize my own voice.
Okay.

802
00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:10.440
<v 9>When I was terrified,
I'm going down.</v>

803
00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:18.260
<v 0>That girl has like an English.
I'm terrified.
Yes.
That's not me.</v>

804
00:54:18.261 --> 00:54:21.830
I can't be me.
I'm terrified.

805
00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:23.570
Why do I sound English?

806
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:30.680
<v 9>Just terrified.
I'm going down opening,
but I'm not going to fall down and die.</v>

807
00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:35.410
<v 0>It's not me.
Fine.
Fine.
I don't think it is.</v>

808
00:54:35.411 --> 00:54:38.440
You're not convinced it.
It's not even,
I don't remember.
It's 20 years ago now,

809
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:42.360
but it doesn't sound like Jean.
You know.

810
00:54:42.370 --> 00:54:45.540
Everyone else keeps remembering to call me that and I love it.
Gee,

811
00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:50.320
all the tabs are like changing need to do.
I forgot that guy called me that.

812
00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:55.470
So funny last night we're in bed and we just want to like chill out,

813
00:54:56.890 --> 00:55:00.870
watch something,
you know.
Kind of easy.

814
00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:05.440
Not too involved.
Yeah.
Cause we were,
we got into dark mirror,
black mirror,

815
00:55:05.830 --> 00:55:09.170
but then then you're fucking bummed out when you go to sleep.
It's negative.

816
00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:13.720
I don't like that.
I got to tell you something.

817
00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:18.010
He's really turned a corner with,

818
00:55:18.130 --> 00:55:23.130
with the level of movie with this much Jack Jack reacher bruise is in Jack

819
00:55:23.261 --> 00:55:27.970
reacher to,
and we saw Jack reacher one I think in theaters and it's your,

820
00:55:28.090 --> 00:55:31.870
it's your like no,
not at all.
It's a good,
you know,

821
00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:37.080
semi big budget we'll say because the budget's gets so crazy now but you know,

822
00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:42.360
full budget production of a action movie and it has decent storyline,

823
00:55:42.491 --> 00:55:46.660
good actors,
good action.
Like well done film where you're like,
you know,

824
00:55:46.661 --> 00:55:51.370
that was a nice time at the movie and it's kind of neat that they named it Jack

825
00:55:51.371 --> 00:55:55.420
reacher so that everybody can call it jack reach around.
Jack reach around,

826
00:55:55.421 --> 00:55:58.810
which this one I should point out is called Jack.

827
00:55:58.811 --> 00:56:01.720
Reach around to I'm,
I'm reaching back.

828
00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:04.870
So in this one,
seeing the first one,

829
00:56:04.871 --> 00:56:09.871
he gave front reach rounds and in this and read Jack reacher til he reaches back

830
00:56:10.031 --> 00:56:13.390
and he,
he jacks off guys behind them,
which is like the big turn.

831
00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:17.440
I got to tell you,
this movie is such a piece of shit.

832
00:56:18.070 --> 00:56:21.040
I mean it's so bad on so many levels.

833
00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:26.440
I know story is tear horrendous.
There's terrible writing,

834
00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:30.550
terrible directing the actors.
You know what it was,
it seemed like,

835
00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:31.870
cause it's a ton of production.

836
00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:36.680
<v 5>I know he had something a few years ago where,
uh,
you know,</v>

837
00:56:36.681 --> 00:56:37.610
him and seven,

838
00:56:37.611 --> 00:56:41.930
the red stone and paramount got in this whole thing and he got this whole,

839
00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:46.700
you know,
there's this whole,
uh,
you know,

840
00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:50.360
back and forth of we're not going to produce Tom cruise movies anymore.

841
00:56:50.361 --> 00:56:54.050
It was like all into Scientology.
Crazy.
Anyways,

842
00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:59.530
so what you see during the opening clips that,
um,
that it's,
it says,
you know,
uh,

843
00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:03.020
Tom Cruise production and when you're watching this movie,

844
00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:07.580
you can't help but notice like are the,
it's almost like they said,
hey,

845
00:57:07.581 --> 00:57:09.830
if we want to get these,
uh,
this list of actors,

846
00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:14.180
it's going to add $1 million to the bottom line.
And then Tom cruise was like,

847
00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:17.000
hey,
what if we,
um,
spent $30,000?

848
00:57:18.130 --> 00:57:20.600
<v 0>It's like so many bad actors movie.</v>

849
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:25.710
That's what I noticed the first five minutes I turned you and I go there acting

850
00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:29.020
like you can tell.
Yeah,
there's so much acting going on,

851
00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:33.670
big acting faces and like,
yeah,
it was like,
what,
what did you say?

852
00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:36.340
It's hard to put a finger on it,
but you know,
if you watch,

853
00:57:36.341 --> 00:57:37.930
let's say one of those Seagal movies,

854
00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:42.250
one of the gall like recent ones where it's a clearly a low budget,

855
00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:46.000
low budget actors.
Yeah.

856
00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:49.870
This movie is full of those like bad actors,

857
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:54.650
<v 5>the writing,
there's like,
there's,
there's no,</v>

858
00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:57.890
nothing is plausible.
Nothing's believable.
No,

859
00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:03.040
nothing makes sense when he confronts the guy no for like,

860
00:58:03.290 --> 00:58:04.880
um,
oh sorry,
spoiler alert,

861
00:58:04.881 --> 00:58:08.480
we're going to ruin the fucking piece of shit movie for you.
But for instance,

862
00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:13.070
you know,
he confronts the,
his friends attorney that's been hired and he's like,

863
00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:18.440
you know,
do you even give a shit,
whatever,
uh,
meet me there tomorrow.

864
00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:22.730
And then they don't give you,
like the Guy Sees Tom Cruise is like,

865
00:58:22.731 --> 00:58:25.400
why are you telling me this?
But then follows through with his orders.

866
00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:30.130
<v 0>It's not even in a four hour.
Right?
Like there's no like,
or what,
right.</v>

867
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:33.870
There's no rapport.
There's no,
there's no black male.
There's not,

868
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:37.000
there's no stakes favorite.
The,
the,

869
00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:41.270
the girl doesn't question really who he is and what he's doing.

870
00:58:41.330 --> 00:58:43.700
An hour into this,
I'm just like,
wait,
who are you?

871
00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:46.850
And she's been traveling with him.
All right.
None of it makes sense.

872
00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:49.440
My favorite is he breaks into,
um,

873
00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:52.730
military police prison.
No,

874
00:58:52.731 --> 00:58:55.190
he gets arrested as a resident and then it breaks out of it.

875
00:58:56.540 --> 00:59:00.510
And also there was one part that I,
this is where I tapped out is when,
um,

876
00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:03.290
he goes,
you can't arrest me.
I'm a civilian now.
I'm not.

877
00:59:03.291 --> 00:59:06.740
I used to be a major and he says about 500 times in the first 50 minutes.

878
00:59:06.741 --> 00:59:10.010
I used to be a major in that.
And they go really well.

879
00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:14.300
Did you read code 10.5 t of the seven h Henry?
And you're like,

880
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:18.260
that's it.
That's why you got him,
you got me a code.

881
00:59:18.590 --> 00:59:22.580
And that's compelling for the audience.
Like what?
There's this one part where he,

882
00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.670
so one of the captains let's say is bad,

883
00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:31.700
they go to his house and they're like,
give us,
give us that file.

884
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:34.280
And the guy has it in his trashcan on his laptop.

885
00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:39.620
So Tom Cruise puts him in a like an a grip and he's like,

886
00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:42.650
give us the code.
And the guy's like,
ah,

887
00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:46.820
ten seven two and then they type in 10,
seven two and it's correct.

888
00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:49.760
And they're like,
thanks.
Leave.
Like there's no,

889
00:59:50.090 --> 00:59:54.020
those scenes are supposed to be like,
you know,
a dramatic buildup.

890
00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:57.950
And then guys supposed to resist and that's how you build the tension of like,

891
00:59:57.980 --> 00:59:59.360
oh,
what's going to happen here?
Well,

892
00:59:59.361 --> 01:00:03.800
and I think the biggest thing that they didn't address in this film is when does

893
01:00:03.801 --> 01:00:06.200
he masturbate?
They don't talk about masturbating.

894
01:00:06.201 --> 01:00:10.160
Another thing I should tell you one hour into the film where you're like,

895
01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:14.120
I'm going to fucking blow my brains out at how bad this is.
Seriously.

896
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:16.720
An hour into the film.
This is such a bad,

897
01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:18.770
and they haven't even shown him taking a ship.
No,

898
01:00:18.771 --> 01:00:23.090
but I just that I hit the pause button to see how much time is left.

899
01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:26.750
One hour.
It's a two hour piece of shit.

900
01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:31.790
Like most action movies that suck,
90 minutes tops,

901
01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:33.920
you know,
usually a little under that because they're like,

902
01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.570
we're just giving you fluffier.

903
01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:40.580
They make a two hour Turd Jack reacher reaching for turn because it's such a

904
01:00:41.601 --> 01:00:42.860
shit fucking,
I mean,

905
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:47.480
I want to see if this trailer is as bad as the movie trailers can be.

906
01:00:47.481 --> 01:00:51.200
Very misleading.
Yeah,
that's their job.
Yeah.
Well actually,
and he might,

907
01:00:51.201 --> 01:00:54.180
but we should say marry your mom.
Oh,
John Wick two.
I can't wait to see that.

908
01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:58.970
That's going to be trainspotting two's coming out.
I'm super excited.
To be fair.

909
01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:01.820
He might drop off in the second hour of the movie.
Oh,

910
01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.150
I'm saying I don't know what happened though yet.
Okay.

911
01:01:05.330 --> 01:01:08.120
I have to break up how bad it is in the tea party.
Well,
we,

912
01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:09.790
we own it because we bought it on.

913
01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:14.120
So maybe tonight we can do part two.

914
01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:17.150
You're going to have to kick catch me up to speed because I tapped out.

915
01:01:17.151 --> 01:01:18.890
I don't think I should do that.
I think you should watch it.

916
01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:23.270
I think you should see his,
the goons at the hired.
They're wearing sunglasses.

917
01:01:23.271 --> 01:01:27.270
Yeah.
The bad guys with a really bad,

918
01:01:27.271 --> 01:01:31.760
and I see
this is the best of the best.
I love this

919
01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:36.740
<v 10>one guy.
Took them all down with his bare hands
still in there,</v>

920
01:01:40.650 --> 01:01:41.483
<v 6>Mr.</v>

921
01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.680
<v 0>Well,
she has slowly</v>

922
01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:50.000
<v 10>aggravated assault.</v>

923
01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:54.730
Is it felony in this state and Mr Mirror system and get him to Cairo.

924
01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:56.433
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

925
01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:01.810
<v 10>Two things are gonna happen in the next 90 seconds.
Use me.
Excuse me.</v>

926
01:02:02.050 --> 01:02:03.820
First that phone over there.
It's gonna ring

927
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:06.223
<v 6>second.</v>

928
01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:10.980
<v 10>You're going to be wearing these cuffs on your waist prison,
mommy?
No,</v>

929
01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:14.590
that is one magnificent prophecy,
Mr. Reach here.

930
01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:21.050
<v 0>Whoa.
See,
it's not a bad trail.</v>

931
01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:24.210
<v 11>Yeah,
keep on mind.
Good so far.
You're like,
all right.</v>

932
01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:28.440
The acting's acting thanks for tubing is on,
not Tom Cruise.
Tom Cruise,

933
01:02:28.441 --> 01:02:30.540
one guy coming to DC.
I move around a lot

934
01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:33.950
<v 5>by the way.
So that exchange right there was thanked for tipping us off.</v>

935
01:02:33.951 --> 01:02:35.000
When he come into DC,

936
01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:40.190
it's like that's their first time speaking right?
And she's,
and you're like,

937
01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:44.390
okay.
He tipped off well,
but he's not in the army.
He just,

938
01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:46.790
he knew about a crooked.

939
01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:50.110
<v 0>Well and why can't they just go to the sheriff's Office and arrest him?</v>

940
01:02:50.111 --> 01:02:53.550
Why did they have to set up that whole cafeteria?
I don't know.
It was so weird.

941
01:02:53.551 --> 01:02:53.650
Yeah,

942
01:02:53.650 --> 01:02:57.730
<v 5>they set that up.
Thanks for coming to DC.
Um,</v>

943
01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:02.470
48 hours later,
he's like,
there,
she's been arrested and he's like,

944
01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:04.050
I gotta get her out.
He's never even

945
01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:07.890
<v 0>never met her before.
I know now I will say Tom Cruise,</v>

946
01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:11.460
who has looked Amaz for the last 50 years,

947
01:03:11.461 --> 01:03:15.380
I think his face is finally sliding off.
Turning a corner.
Yeah.
Yeah.

948
01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:19.110
And I thought he got braces and he embraces yeah.
A while ago.
Yeah.

949
01:03:19.111 --> 01:03:23.970
But they look crooked again.
They do.
I look and he's in incredible shape.

950
01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:28.610
I think the guy looks like a,
what is it,
brick shithouse.
Oh,

951
01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:32.220
right.
We're describing,
but yeah,
no,
he's in amazing shape.
Yeah.

952
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:35.730
But the face is starting to slide down.
Yeah.
It's riding off.

953
01:03:35.731 --> 01:03:40.350
He's gotta be 50 something.
He's,
there's a scene is too old to be an action guy.

954
01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:43.200
You know what I mean?
He refuses to accept that.
I know.

955
01:03:43.201 --> 01:03:45.330
He's too old for this shit.
Let me tell you.

956
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:49.890
Does he doesn't do mission impossible anymore?
Does he do those movie?
No.
Yeah,

957
01:03:49.891 --> 01:03:53.520
they just did one in the wild with him.
Yeah.
He's old as fuck now.

958
01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:58.710
I don't know that he's old as fuck.
He looks like he's 54.
Um,
in the film,

959
01:03:58.711 --> 01:04:03.540
there's one scene where they're fugitives and the guy's like male,
Caucasian,

960
01:04:03.541 --> 01:04:08.130
male,
forties sucker.
That's definitely,

961
01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:11.460
and he's like,
just put that in the,
okay.
It could be,
or television.

962
01:04:11.461 --> 01:04:14.940
Cause we have a high def TV and I do notice you look away.

963
01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:19.920
Worser on that high def boy.
Yeah.
Very unforgiving.
High definition television.

964
01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:24.450
Uh,
oil boy.
I watched that new Bridget Jones's baby.

965
01:04:24.451 --> 01:04:28.170
She looked fucking rough too.
Yeah,
yeah.
At the really,

966
01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:30.300
she had like a lot of work done that right.
She did.

967
01:04:30.301 --> 01:04:33.450
And then she denied it I think.
And that that's,
you know,

968
01:04:33.451 --> 01:04:36.780
I don't know why people deny.
So check this out in the work.
Just say you did it.

969
01:04:36.781 --> 01:04:41.280
Who Cares?
Mission impossible was 96 [inaudible] gray movie.
Excellent.

970
01:04:41.281 --> 01:04:45.990
Love those movies came out in 2003 came out.
No,
six.

971
01:04:46.210 --> 01:04:48.570
Wow.
Four came out in 2011.

972
01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:53.790
Five came out in 2015 and six is coming out in 2018.

973
01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:56.640
I love those movies.
I'll watch them.
There are a lot of fun,

974
01:04:56.820 --> 01:05:00.070
but this pile of dog shit,
let's get back to it.
And he made it.

975
01:05:01.310 --> 01:05:06.110
<v 11>Folks wonder why you left Purple Heart,
Silver Star purple in the dusk.</v>

976
01:05:06.111 --> 01:05:07.780
People say you made it with someone's past.

977
01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:13.250
Jack reacher for major Turner.
Major Turner has been arrested on what?
Charge?

978
01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:15.260
Espionage.
He's been set up.

979
01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:18.800
How much does it reach or no,

980
01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:20.270
<v 0>as it goes</v>

981
01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:25.260
<v 11>bad guys,
the bad glasses on Pete follows.
You think you're invulnerable.</v>

982
01:05:25.261 --> 01:05:26.094
That's right.

983
01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:29.580
<v 0>So far though,
the is way better than the film.</v>

984
01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:33.060
And I remember we watched this trailer and we were debating on which dumb thing

985
01:05:33.061 --> 01:05:35.910
to watch it or night and you go,
oh well that's definitely dumb.

986
01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:39.930
So let's put that on the back burner for later.
Like this isn't a great trailer.

987
01:05:40.330 --> 01:05:45.150
The trailer is good.
Here's the other thing,
the pacing.
Action needs pacing.
Yeah.

988
01:05:45.570 --> 01:05:48.530
The scenes have no pacing time.

989
01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:52.680
Maybe Steven Seagal ghostwrote maybe edited the film.

990
01:05:52.770 --> 01:05:54.150
Directed and edited this film.

991
01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:56.620
<v 11>Rip your arm off,
beat you to death with it.</v>

992
01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:07.610
He's here to kill you
by men were shot.

993
01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:12.740
It's bigger than I imagined ever.
Lose anyone on your watch.

994
01:06:12.741 --> 01:06:17.741
Richard [inaudible].

995
01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:27.140
<v 0>I'm waiting for those rear race around scenes.</v>

996
01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:31.880
This movie he reaches between his legs.
You know,

997
01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:40.220
<v 11>I'm going to kill you off.
I'm done.</v>

998
01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:45.890
<v 0>It's a tap down or I am bored.
Well,
we get to watch part two tonight,</v>

999
01:06:46.330 --> 01:06:49.260
but that John Wick Two's going to be a good one.
Yeah,
that'll be good.
All right.

1000
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:53.870
I can't.
First one was really good.
Oh yeah.
I love,
you know I love Keanu.

1001
01:06:53.871 --> 01:06:56.950
I can watch him do anything.
I can do anything.
Um,

1002
01:06:57.730 --> 01:07:01.220
what did you marry your mom?
Well,
Marian mom,
can I,

1003
01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:05.390
oh,
somebody else submitted that.

1004
01:07:05.391 --> 01:07:09.940
They got a voicemails like their own silo may calls.
Yeah.

1005
01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:12.740
They said they'd be getting voicemails at work

1006
01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:17.180
and there we go.

1007
01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:22.030
<v 12>Yeah.
Now</v>

1008
01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.160
I want your ass home.

1009
01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:37.700
I want your ass now you got me now I'm going to raise some kind of hell.

1010
01:07:39.181 --> 01:07:42.310
You never seen you.
You

1011
01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:47.040
fucking ass right now

1012
01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:51.180
around you.
Don't get on that phone.
Call me back.

1013
01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:53.840
And we'd go on to have a hay day down here.

1014
01:07:55.890 --> 01:07:57.840
I'll show you how that shit goes

1015
01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:02.250
up on me after dinner and thank God I don't know.

1016
01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:06.000
Skip that and gone and that land is gone and all this bullshit.

1017
01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:10.300
You're fucking her right here in the building.
I think he's after weapon.

1018
01:08:10.590 --> 01:08:14.130
You get your fucking ass now.
God Damn little mother fucker

1019
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:17.203
cleaner.

1020
01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:22.280
<v 5>Yeah.
The best part of this is much like Salamay.
Hmm.
Um,</v>

1021
01:08:22.690 --> 01:08:26.860
this lady is convinced that she left a certain person this voicemail.
Yeah.

1022
01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:29.830
So when she sees him,
she's like,
what's up?

1023
01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:35.500
You got to talking to what are you talking about?
You got,
you heard that message.

1024
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:38.590
Don't think he didn't fucking hear that message.
And he's like,

1025
01:08:38.591 --> 01:08:42.490
I didn't hear any message.
I Avaya Toyota Vega tell you that cleaner.

1026
01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:48.180
<v 12>Yeah.
And no
teaching your cleaner</v>

1027
01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:53.890
<v 0>psyche deed cleaners.
Yeah.
Well that accent,
no more solid may calls it right.</v>

1028
01:08:54.310 --> 01:08:59.260
No,
but I've got a neat update.
Um,
I've been getting texts about idas.
Yeah.

1029
01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:03.820
[inaudible] ice apparently on Facebook activated his phone number and now I'm

1030
01:09:03.821 --> 01:09:06.970
getting text updates whenever I just gets a Facebook update.

1031
01:09:07.270 --> 01:09:11.290
So like Molly posted a picture of the people that had your number.
Yeah.

1032
01:09:11.410 --> 01:09:16.410
Is and then Salami and then woman to the nurse,

1033
01:09:16.681 --> 01:09:19.420
the nurse.
And she's been getting a lot of offers out of Boca Raton,

1034
01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:23.350
but she's not getting them.
No.
I need to update their information now.

1035
01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:26.680
So fucking annoying.
Usually her cause it's for a job.
Yeah.

1036
01:09:26.681 --> 01:09:28.300
You'd think shanaze would be on top,
but

1037
01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:33.030
<v 5>so as far as um,
you know,
we were looking for boring things,
boring clips.</v>

1038
01:09:33.450 --> 01:09:35.310
Uh,
we find out that the uh,

1039
01:09:35.311 --> 01:09:39.270
those engineer clips or fake that they were like an inside joke of mine

1040
01:09:39.290 --> 01:09:43.830
engineers.
But here's an actual and was kind enough to send us a truly boring,

1041
01:09:43.850 --> 01:09:46.230
but that's not a joke.
Oh,
thank you.
Yeah.

1042
01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:51.170
<v 11>Okay.
The next section we'll be going to his section five.
That's the air brakes.</v>

1043
01:09:53.130 --> 01:09:58.130
This guy looks boring following along term to your section five page five days

1044
01:09:59.011 --> 01:10:02.820
one and this section covers air brake system parts,

1045
01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:04.770
dual airbrake systems,

1046
01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:09.830
inspecting air brakes and using airbrush travel sometime called the uh,

1047
01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:16.160
foot valve or travel valve is what activates your brakes on the,

1048
01:10:16.890 --> 01:10:19.200
on your tractor and trailer.
And the harder you push on it,

1049
01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:22.170
the more pressure it will be a post on the brakes,
right?
Yeah.

1050
01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:27.870
The foundation brakes,
the beach axle right on your tractor and trailer.

1051
01:10:28.230 --> 01:10:31.870
Let's walk over and take a look at it yet.
Mock up.
I've had a foundation.

1052
01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:36.240
The airline will come into your air chamber.
This unit at this point,

1053
01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:39.670
when you press on the brake chamber,
right,

1054
01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:43.290
which pushes this push to boards or your board and

1055
01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:49.510
you may have an application pressure gauge.
Oh my God.

1056
01:10:50.010 --> 01:10:53.110
If you do,
that's a gauge that tells you how much pressure you're putting on.

1057
01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:58.220
You know,
this guy is so boring.
Check your brake system.
Uh,

1058
01:10:58.230 --> 01:10:59.610
you should,
uh,
do it.

1059
01:10:59.611 --> 01:11:04.080
Just like you were doing your pre trip and a [inaudible] apartment.

1060
01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:08.310
<v 0>Please,
please.
That was really good.
I was bad.
Terrible.</v>

1061
01:11:08.610 --> 01:11:13.110
Can I read an email update I got on eating Brown?
Of course.

1062
01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:17.430
You know,
we brought up the hammock clip,
which was a,
what's that guy's name?

1063
01:11:17.431 --> 01:11:21.530
Mcafee.
The famous guy that invented antivirus,
whatever.

1064
01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:23.520
Fuck he has women in Guatemala.

1065
01:11:23.521 --> 01:11:28.110
Is it or believes it was in the least believes in hammocks with holes cut out

1066
01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:33.030
the bottom and they should into his mouth to which I responded with,

1067
01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.580
well,
doesn't that make him sick to eat brown?

1068
01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:38.490
And so we got a couple of emails from some health professionals.

1069
01:11:38.491 --> 01:11:42.450
I thought you'd want to hear.
Ready?
Hey jeans.

1070
01:11:42.451 --> 01:11:45.810
After hearing a few of your podcasts about these disturbing behaviors.

1071
01:11:45.811 --> 01:11:49.680
I had to look it up.
I've actually seen people exhibit these behaviors,

1072
01:11:49.681 --> 01:11:53.760
but that's because I'm a nurse and a prison for Max security,

1073
01:11:53.761 --> 01:11:55.770
psych inmates,
inmates.

1074
01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:00.060
The truly funniest thing I've seen with fecal matter was an inmate who made

1075
01:12:00.061 --> 01:12:03.600
sculptures out of his shit as well as poo crayons.

1076
01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:09.200
He then wrote messages on the wall with said crayons at least once a month.

1077
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:15.200
An inmate is eating their own shit pool to answer whether you'd get physically

1078
01:12:15.691 --> 01:12:18.510
ill.
I have never seen any of them get sick from it.

1079
01:12:19.050 --> 01:12:23.250
The pool pool you go and hold on.

1080
01:12:23.251 --> 01:12:25.080
We got another one.
Tom.
Christina.

1081
01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:30.320
I'm a support worker and one of my clients eats his own brown and his medically

1082
01:12:30.391 --> 01:12:33.600
well.
He eats it every day.
Once a support worker,
what does that mean?

1083
01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:37.800
I don't support worker.
I don't know.
Support.
Maybe that's from another country.

1084
01:12:38.230 --> 01:12:41.670
Maybe.
Why don't I just Google it?
Okay.
I'll support worker.

1085
01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:45.020
It might be a social worker and one of my clients eats his poop every day.

1086
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:47.970
Every day.
Oh God.

1087
01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:51.600
Support workers can work in a residential care home,

1088
01:12:51.601 --> 01:12:55.380
don't domiciliary care or out in the community.

1089
01:12:55.410 --> 01:12:59.130
Their work is defined by a care plan,
which is often develop our social worker.

1090
01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:02.790
Okay.
God,
I was turning into the fucking eating my guy there for a minute,

1091
01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:05.170
reading and shit.
Oh God dammit.

1092
01:13:07.810 --> 01:13:08.730
Let us cleanse our Palette.

1093
01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:16.650
<v 6>You
Buddy.
What you doing?</v>

1094
01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:23.300
Yeah.
Yes,

1095
01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:27.860
<v 0>Dan.
Nice.
Getting the next generation and on it,
you know,
in that glass.

Thank you.
Her name is Talon,
I think are Taylan forgive me.

1140
01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:40.120
Talent in addition to my husband peeing on me in the shower,

1141
01:16:40.150 --> 01:16:45.150
hot boxing me at every opportunity and nicknaming my slightly soft stomach,

1142
01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:50.080
Chubby Tbi.
He has all,
he also thinks it's funny to try putting his toe in my,

1143
01:16:50.081 --> 01:16:51.850
but he does this one.

1144
01:16:51.851 --> 01:16:56.170
I am fresh out of the shower and standing on one leg trying to put my other foot

1145
01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:57.340
in my underwear.

1146
01:16:57.730 --> 01:17:02.050
His favorite times are when he can knock me off balance long enough to then

1147
01:17:02.051 --> 01:17:05.530
shove said toe in my face and ask me if it's clean.

1148
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:10.730
I feel your pain mommy.
Okay.
Just keep glassing guy's a legend.
Uh,

1149
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:13.250
okay.
That guy's awesome.
Yeah.
My deaf.

1150
01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:15.680
My husband definitely treats me like a 10 year old boy.

1151
01:17:15.681 --> 01:17:19.790
And all I can say is men like these only make our personality standout strong

1152
01:17:19.791 --> 01:17:23.390
because they exchange.
Very true.
Very true.
Uh,

1153
01:17:23.391 --> 01:17:28.070
email says Tommy is mommy.
Tina kidding?
Did she hit her head?

1154
01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:30.350
I have a Bulgarian daughter in law.

1155
01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:33.080
Not sure what they do to those poor eastern bloc kids.

1156
01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:36.230
She is sweet but best personality.

1157
01:17:37.670 --> 01:17:41.390
You can include best personality champ to water and weight loss champ.

1158
01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:45.980
Thanks jeans.
I you seriously,
uh,
and then nerf dude wrote,

1159
01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:49.850
making a list of your husband's verbal trespasses is not the action of a

1160
01:17:49.851 --> 01:17:53.630
personality clean.
Interesting.
Interesting.

1161
01:17:53.631 --> 01:17:55.640
How you're only reading those in favor of you.

1162
01:17:55.641 --> 01:17:59.300
That's finally reading what's in front of me.
It's on the sheet.
Uh,

1163
01:17:59.390 --> 01:18:03.710
serious FARC question.
Have you ever farted on a scale and lost weight?

1164
01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:08.030
I have not wondered if it's possible.
Um,
I have not.

1165
01:18:08.031 --> 01:18:12.210
I wonder if it's possible.
I had my first double pike classic on Xmas Eve.
What?

1166
01:18:12.230 --> 01:18:15.680
Congratulations.
So excited.
I couldn't find words.

1167
01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:20.240
Thanks for all the important discussions.
Let's go water champ.
James.

1168
01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:25.720
I'm angry with me because an email I wrote in asking if you sneeze and Burp at

1169
01:18:25.851 --> 01:18:29.870
the same time.
Is that considered [inaudible] cars?
No,
sneezing.
A burp.

1170
01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:33.110
Was this this email?
Oh,
if I used to sneeze in Fart.
No,

1171
01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:35.900
but a lot of people have asked that too.
Is that something special?

1172
01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:40.870
It's such nonsense that they want to be rewarded or credited for something that,

1173
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:45.980
I mean a sneeze,
you know,
it's a natural occurrence happens quite often.

1174
01:18:45.981 --> 01:18:49.610
And the fact that you know,
pressure is being pushed out,

1175
01:18:50.110 --> 01:18:55.110
it's quite common that you would sneeze and Fart at the same time.

1176
01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:58.510
The fact that we're going to act like that's something to be celebrated.
It's,

1177
01:18:58.511 --> 01:18:59.810
it's,
it's absurd.
It's like,

1178
01:18:59.811 --> 01:19:03.800
so what differentiates that from the double pipe class?
It's so rare.

1179
01:19:03.801 --> 01:19:08.480
It's like it's,
it doesn't make sense.
Usually that air chooses one canal,

1180
01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:13.070
it splits in two.
I mean,
that really is a magical,
it's like a triple rainbow.

1181
01:19:13.071 --> 01:19:17.180
It's like seeing orcas come up and feed at the sunset.
It's,
it's,
uh,

1182
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:22.310
it's one of like nature's,
you know,
it's like a Mousse going down.
Exactly.

1183
01:19:22.311 --> 01:19:26.600
You know,
and,
and people go their entire lives without them.
That's true.

1184
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:30.770
Sneezing and farting.
I mean,
several times a week you probably do that.

1185
01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:35.000
I feel like that is a rare occurrence to,
I don't sneeze a whole lot,

1186
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:37.310
but I don't have that here.
Oh,
can I?

1187
01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:41.840
May I make a case for sneezing and farting place because when you sneeze,

1188
01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:45.800
you clench your sphincter.
Okay.
Yeah.
You're clenching.

1189
01:19:45.810 --> 01:19:49.820
So for a Fart to come out and make sound at the same time as this needs,

1190
01:19:49.821 --> 01:19:54.470
maybe that is a harder feet because the clenching naturally wants to happen and

1191
01:19:54.490 --> 01:19:55.980
it's not that special.
It's not this special.

1192
01:19:56.060 --> 01:20:00.380
I've never heard you fart and sneeze.
Oh,
I've done it dozens and dozens of times.

1193
01:20:00.410 --> 01:20:05.230
Yeah,
it's not special.
Um,
okay.
Uh,

1194
01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:10.530
so bro,
I know you are a big football fan.
We got some Eli Manning,

1195
01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:13.830
Peyton manning and I,
many Peyton manning post game interview right here.

1196
01:20:14.430 --> 01:20:15.300
<v 14>These guys actually,</v>

1197
01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:18.240
how long does this missed opportunities go through your mind?

1198
01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:22.080
You just think about the cop.
Well,
oh,
we'll see.
Obviously there's still,

1199
01:20:22.081 --> 01:20:25.440
if they're still right there,
this would hurts.
Um,
you know,
just when you,

1200
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:30.060
when you look back and you,
and,
uh,
you know,
you'd see that we,
you know,
had some,

1201
01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:34.940
had some,
uh,
some chances and we had a good plan and you know,
uh,

1202
01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:36.900
had good place called at the,

1203
01:20:36.901 --> 01:20:41.220
at the right time to take advantage of what they were doing and,
and,
um,
you know,

1204
01:20:41.221 --> 01:20:44.900
just couldn't,
couldn't a lot of emails through the block,

1205
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:46.890
righteous close.

1206
01:20:46.891 --> 01:20:51.030
What's the offense to really having to type out that it was capable of cabins

1207
01:20:51.031 --> 01:20:55.350
here?
I thought,
you know,
I thought,
uh,
yeah.
You know,
guy,
I thought we were close.

1208
01:20:55.630 --> 01:20:58.340
Thought teams were giving us a whole lot.
Uh,

1209
01:20:58.710 --> 01:21:02.700
I used to get the ball down the field and find yourself on an Adl scale.

1210
01:21:03.790 --> 01:21:07.390
Uh,
it was tough.
It was tough one,
you know,

1211
01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:14.260
you know,
help you,
you know what?

1212
01:21:16.190 --> 01:21:18.890
<v 0>Yeah,
it's good.
Yeah,
it's good.
But you know,</v>

1213
01:21:18.891 --> 01:21:22.100
you've always made that distinction,
that a,
you know,

1214
01:21:22.101 --> 01:21:22.761
and you know what I'm saying?

1215
01:21:22.761 --> 01:21:26.930
It's not the same that that I'm a stickler the way you are about a sneezing and

1216
01:21:26.931 --> 01:21:28.240
farting.
It's not special.

1217
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:31.460
<v 15>Two one I've talked about how you sitting there in the first words out of your</v>

1218
01:21:31.461 --> 01:21:35.120
mouth is,
you know what I'm saying?
No,
I mean,
no to hell we don't use it.

1219
01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:39.490
<v 0>I don't know what you're saying and I don't know what you mean.
Yeah,
yeah.</v>

1220
01:21:39.970 --> 01:21:43.090
Well you know as an a different category than,
you know what I'm saying?

1221
01:21:43.390 --> 01:21:45.970
You're talking about feel me.
It's different.
It's all different.
Yeah.

1222
01:21:46.810 --> 01:21:51.670
I totally get you.
Um,
are you ready for a oh,

1223
01:21:51.671 --> 01:21:52.504
This came in,

1224
01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:57.370
this kid records himself talking to his dad about eating ass and his dad is so

1225
01:21:57.371 --> 01:22:00.560
not on board course.
That is like,
that's a part of society.

1226
01:22:02.230 --> 01:22:06.410
<v 15>Got The shitty mark.
No fuck on you.
And you followed any damn love.

1229
01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:19.460
So do you know any girlfriend about Oh,

It's just,
you guys are so absurd.

1318
01:28:24.910 --> 01:28:27.280
It's so smart and funny.

Question for you.

1325
01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:51.040
Do you guys have the same menu as like down in Hollywood,

1326
01:28:51.041 --> 01:28:52.210
downtown La in that area

1327
01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:56.940
are probably are some differences they have you looking at,

1328
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:59.950
they had a couple different breakfast.
One called the Brown town.

1329
01:29:01.710 --> 01:29:04.770
Yeah.
No.
If it's like if you have a recipe for it,

1330
01:29:04.771 --> 01:29:08.190
we might be able to make it big mushy purple either.

1331
01:29:08.191 --> 01:29:11.580
I don't see no,
probably.

1332
01:29:11.670 --> 01:29:13.230
It's probably different.

1333
01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:16.920
They have like some health food stuff down there to keep you regular and all

1334
01:29:16.921 --> 01:29:20.470
that for the old folks.
You know what I'm saying?
For real snow.

1413
01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:54.440

but it's got sweetener in it so it takes away,
no,

1414
01:34:54.441 --> 01:34:56.930
it doesn't have to suite near water and tea and it contains,

1415
01:34:57.350 --> 01:35:01.910
so it's negative water.
It contains caffeine,
so it's negative three.
