it's one of the most amazing,

25
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.120
I'm still in awe of the fact that,
uh,

26
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.880
he was able to

27
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.730
piece together conversation and make it rhyme.

116
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.690
Oh,

I think it's from the French Alps.

117
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:33.170

Hold on.

121
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.190
I liked his little voice in a big part.
He's like the white guy version of that.

122
00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:53.760
This guy,
Carl's Womack says he's not going anywhere.

123
00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:58.910
<v 1>Just trying to help
college kids cause they ain't got no money.</v>

124
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:04.550

Sickness.
Voices.
Absurd.

126
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.230
He jumped off the blue cove a few times and hit his nuts on the rocks.

127
00:10:10.231 --> 00:10:13.890
It happened exactly one year and 10 days from the one year on Sunday.

128
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.260
Womack says he's not changing any of those roles here despite the two tragic

129
00:10:19.261 --> 00:10:20.094
deaths

130
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.940

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.880

133
00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:35.920
<v 3>what was going on here.</v>

134
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:41.210
That's got be one of the worst ways is to have to live with,
I came with,

135
00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.870
I can't mimic it.
That's too high.
Pitched

136
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.440
very masculine.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.920
Your Voice is very deep and sexual.

138
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:58.350
Especially lately you've really been embracing kind of a sexy dad persona.

What do you think?
Sure.

144
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:26.640
Don't feel like he finds me sexy at all.
Really.
It's an upgrade.

145
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.240
It's definitely,

You look like you just,

146
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.350
you can open books,
not just close them like Ellis does that.

147
00:11:34.351 --> 00:11:39.270
He'll just close the cover
takes after his dad.
Is that sexy?

148
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:44.700
You've also been taking up a cigar smoking and drinking.

149
00:11:44.701 --> 00:11:48.450
Like what is it?
Scotch.
That's like dad's stuff too.

150
00:11:48.451 --> 00:11:52.140
You've really been embracing this,
that identity had one on one?
Yeah.

151
00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.070
Only had a couple cigars

152
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.780
<v 0>actually.
No,
I didn't do it now because you've no,
no.</v>

153
00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:59.520
I bought a bunch and thinking that at the,

154
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.160
when we had that reception here that I could hand those out to people and be

155
00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:06.850
like,
you wanna smoke a cigar and nobody was interested in,
I forgot to offer.

156
00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.940
So now I have like a box I said goes.
But um,
uh,

157
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.600
the Scots thing,
you know,
it is something that I always wanted to,

158
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:21.850
cause you hear about people having these,
I don't know,
a drink with,
they're like,

159
00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.200
oh my God,
that's amazing.

160
00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:26.560
That quality and at bars that I've gone to or just growing up,

161
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.880
I never went for the high quality stuff.
You always just drank to get,
you know,

162
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.700
rent to get ripped.
Yeah.
So pooling your poop pile later.

163
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.880
So it's just been fun to explore it a little bit.
I just did a little research.

164
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:41.260
I bought a bottle and um,
it was actually delicious.
Everybody at that,

165
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.650
at that part.
It was,
I can try that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

166
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:48.010
So does this affect your Dj Dad Map Persona?

167
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.760
It does feel like a,
a very,
you know,

168
00:12:51.761 --> 00:12:53.200
a great departure from it.

169
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:56.980
But I feel like dad mouth is who I am at my core.

170
00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:02.040
That's how it's different than sexy dad.
Like I feel like,
yeah,
not really.

171
00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:07.090
This is an alter ego.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They don't,
they don't hang out.

172
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:12.160
They don't hand them all like Dj Dad and it's like a cool dad and then,
well,

173
00:13:12.161 --> 00:13:12.701
I mean,

174
00:13:12.701 --> 00:13:17.410
Dj dad mouth doesn't even fully accept that he is a dad,

175
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:19.420
you know?
That's why he's a DJ.

176
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.590
Like he knows he probably has kids,

177
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.200
but it's not like,
yeah,

178
00:13:26.201 --> 00:13:28.930
I don't think dad mother's going home for their birthdays and stuff.

179
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.320
Definitely would sexy.

180
00:13:32.321 --> 00:13:37.321
Dad would probably buy a sexy present to give to his child on a sexy birthday.

181
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:42.760
You know?
Oh,
the baby's sexy birthday.
Yeah.
Like the sexy dad would be like,

182
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:46.720
when does that start?
Sexy baby birthday?
Well,

183
00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.060
I think sexy that does it from first birthday.

184
00:13:49.061 --> 00:13:52.200
He just buys like maybe a mesh top for child.

185
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.070
Can we play that Instagram video?

186
00:13:54.071 --> 00:13:57.500
That guy dancing just as you're talking your dad on please.

187
00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:59.260
He sent this to me yesterday.

188
00:13:59.261 --> 00:14:03.130
I know he posted on Instagram and my fucking brain almost exploded because it

189
00:14:03.131 --> 00:14:06.490
looks,
I got a lot of texts about that.
People were loving that.
Oh my God,

190
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.740
it's so my dad,
first of all,
you nailed it.

191
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.410
Like he's probably doing this right now as we're,
as we're talking of,

192
00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:15.490
see this guy's holy shit for our listeners.

193
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.280
I Dunno how to discipline,
but talk over it.

194
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.680
Just have it playing in the background cause it's so rad.
Let me see here.

195
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.360
Let's continue the sexy dad discussion.
I don't want to lose it.
No,
of course.

196
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:29.730
Of course.
Oh my fuck theory is,
did he so rad?
Yeah,

197
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.590
I mean how would you describe this man?
Everything.
It's,
it's the guy who's,

198
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.900
you know,
the most interesting man in the world and to be your guy,

199
00:14:37.901 --> 00:14:40.180
it's him and he's got a dark,

200
00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.630
leathery Tan and he's got a gold chain.
That's got,

201
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:48.660
got like dog tags on it and then he's wearing a wrist wrap thing and gold and an

202
00:14:49.721 --> 00:14:53.870
ankle one too.
And this,
this is like a skirt.
He's got like a man skirt on it.

203
00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:54.980
I think it's a Speedo,

204
00:14:54.981 --> 00:14:58.670
but then he put like a loin cloth over it and he's got glasses.

205
00:14:58.671 --> 00:15:02.090
And if he's having like a dance off super lean,

206
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:06.580
he's got the v like the cock.
Yeah.
He looks like a piece of Turkey jerky.
Oh yeah.

207
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:10.370
And they're doing this like Greece dance.
Like you're the one that I want.

208
00:15:10.371 --> 00:15:13.580
And like they taunt,
they go back and forth,
not class.
He liked that.

209
00:15:13.581 --> 00:15:15.080
It's super as like Ibiza.

210
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:19.200
Tana European moves fucking brought over here.
Yeah.
He's so,

211
00:15:19.201 --> 00:15:22.040
you're of hand and that's why I love it.
Look at it.
Oh,

212
00:15:22.041 --> 00:15:26.090
in any person's pretends to puncher.
Yeah.
It's so fucking rad dude.

213
00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:29.630
Ah,
why?
Why?
She was like,
oh,
and the clapping.

214
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:34.260
My Dad claps a lot when he dances to European stuff is just,

215
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.100
it's just a sunbathing.
Yeah.
My Dad's my dad's life.
It's,

216
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:42.680
it'd be that all the time.
Huh?
This is totally my dad.
It's this,

217
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.820
I feel like this is ed though.
This may,

218
00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:49.490
and I don't even know if this guy has money a thing or he's the kind of guy that

219
00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:53.510
people with money just keep around like a party guy them around.
Yeah,

220
00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:57.380
because he's got the best cocaine.
Sure.
Oh.
And then he dares her to a dance off.

221
00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:01.340
It's just it,
his hair is white though,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

222
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.200
The moves are so European too,
so bad.

223
00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.640
And they're at a multimillion dollar place.
You can tell them.
Yeah.
You know,

224
00:16:10.641 --> 00:16:14.630
like infinity pool and all wipe stuff.
If you're,
if you're not on youtube,

225
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:18.920
at least look at Tom's Instagram and my Instagram feed.
Yeah,
you're going to die.

226
00:16:18.921 --> 00:16:22.880
It's the vast,
that's pretty good.
Everything.
Okay.
So Jesus,

227
00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:27.730
let us talk about your sexy dad.
Now.
Uh,

228
00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.800
that is not a sexy dad.
I know,
Barb.
Yeah.

229
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.960
I shadow dance with my hands.

230
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:40.730
My finger and my ass
is fat.

231
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.360
You love that song.
I listened to it on a loop.
So what?
I mean,
you know,

232
00:16:44.361 --> 00:16:46.400
we watch that video and then I listened to that.

233
00:16:46.401 --> 00:16:48.050
So I have a make sound machine in front of me

234
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:55.680
and magical sandbox or is it due to the eye shadow dodge with my hands.

235
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.770
My finger in my ass.

236
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:06.670
Was that song that the Bertus fat or is it it's friends as are,

237
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:12.170
yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
Here we go.
[inaudible]
is it,

238
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:19.090
I thought this is it.
Yeah,
this is it.
This is it.
This is it.
Let it go.
Know,

239
00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.580
<v 7>do
fluffy.</v>

240
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:56.280
It
is fine.

241
00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.320
<v 0>I bet.
Sexy vacations ad.</v>

242
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:53.200
What's your Pronoun Man?
Last week's episode.

243
00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:56.170
I got into it with my parents about pronouns,

244
00:18:56.410 --> 00:19:00.880
so fun just to hear them be like,
so are you eat?

245
00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.810
My Dad was like,
I just like to get to know people's name.

246
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.790
I think the whole concept just blew his mind.
He was like,
yeah,

247
00:19:09.791 --> 00:19:14.770
I just rather you should ask her name,
name.
I go,

248
00:19:14.771 --> 00:19:18.380
you know,
you say like Zim over there and he's like,
ah.
It's called Bob.

249
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:24.030
Okay,
what's your phone now?
Yeah,

250
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:27.780
ask.
Someone's come.
Yeah.

251
00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:33.020
That's really rude because I like a obviously a boy.
Gertler.

252
00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:34.040
We've got sun,

253
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:38.560
it's got stone and then your sister was on last week's episode and I'm,

254
00:19:38.561 --> 00:19:42.550
holy moly.
Yeah,
the evolution of Maria's concerns.

255
00:19:42.551 --> 00:19:45.640
I mean it used to be Starbucks and then she had a kid,

256
00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:49.210
two kids and then now it's all about discharge.

257
00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:54.240
Her biggest problem is vaginal discharge and semen leaking out of her and like,

258
00:19:56.450 --> 00:20:00.130
yeah,
mostly and fat people fuck up.

259
00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:05.320
Disgusting.
Real low thing for fat people.
We gotta so disgusting.

260
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:09.960
People are still discussing that discussing.
Um,

261
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.790
I know we have blah blah blah.
We use this APP by the way,

262
00:20:15.791 --> 00:20:20.590
door dash a lot to get through to us.
We finally,

263
00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:22.031
yesterday,

264
00:20:22.031 --> 00:20:27.031
I think for the first time ever we're defeated by Sushi and we didn't realize

265
00:20:28.091 --> 00:20:30.880
what happened was we placed an order.

266
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:34.000
We actually ordered too much Sushi is what you're saying.

267
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.530
What I'm saying is it for the first we were given too much Sushi.

268
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:41.350
I don't think we were ordered too much Sushi.
Yeah,

269
00:20:41.351 --> 00:20:45.310
because remember the whole order complication.
Yeah,
it didn't make sense.

270
00:20:45.311 --> 00:20:48.040
So we ordered at like five and it tells

271
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.800
<v 4>you,
it tracks your order.
You can see the restaurant.
Has your honor,</v>

272
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.300
the restaurants making your food,
a driver picked up your order,

273
00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.780
a drivers bringing your order,
and then it says delivered.

274
00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:04.320
So it says like the restaurants making your food and then it says the drivers

275
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:08.950
waiting and then it's,
you know,
it's five o'clock ordered at six o'clock.

276
00:21:08.951 --> 00:21:13.180
It says the drivers waiting six 15 so now you're like,
all right,

277
00:21:13.181 --> 00:21:16.180
it's been an hour,
six 30 and so you're like,
hey man,
what's going on?

278
00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:20.130
And the guys like the orders so big,
uh,

279
00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:25.150
that I got to wait like we've heard that tall tale before.
Yeah.
And you're like,

280
00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:29.080
Oh man,
yeah,
the Sushi orders.
You're like,
dude,
what are you talking about?

281
00:21:29.081 --> 00:21:32.920
Orders are always to bank,
but they're not that big.
You know,

282
00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:37.810
they always cry about how big it is.
They do.
And they cry.
10 sets of Sushi.

283
00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:40.650
Is this for your party you're throwing tonight?
Yeah.

284
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:45.460
So they gave us all the chopsticks and,
but usually it's just that we get,

285
00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:46.380
you know,
I dunno,

286
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:51.390
let's say we order eight or nine Sushi orders,

287
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:56.230
a couple roles and sometimes there's something else,
you know,

288
00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:59.610
seaweed salad or something like that.
So it's always like,
I dunno,

289
00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.470
it feels very manageable.
But anyways,
this guy was like,
well,
you know,

290
00:22:02.471 --> 00:22:05.290
the order is so big.
And I'm like,
what are you talking about man?

291
00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:10.030
Then I started doing the,
you can DM their customer service.

292
00:22:10.031 --> 00:22:11.100
It has nothing to do with the driver,

293
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:13.780
the drivers just there to pick up your food.
So it's never really,

294
00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:18.570
this issue is not the driver issue time.
Sometimes it is,
sometimes it isn't.

295
00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.400
The driver punked out and just decided not to show up.

296
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:25.240
And then another driver came.
We've had lots of dealings with this APP.
I know,

297
00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:29.620
I know.
And a fan some days.
Well I'm really not a fan of their customer service.

298
00:22:29.621 --> 00:22:34.621
And what I mean is that I think it's so annoying when you can read the training

299
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.860
and the customer service person.
You could sometimes you get it on the phone.
Yep.

300
00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.830
And you just go like I know you're just mimicking your training.

301
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:43.800
They tried to empathize with you.

302
00:22:43.801 --> 00:22:46.870
So they use the emotional empathy so that they don't actually have to do

303
00:22:46.871 --> 00:22:50.260
anything.
Exactly.
So the fuck if you care about my feelings,

304
00:22:50.261 --> 00:22:53.530
I'm sitting there like damning this guy and I go,
look man,

305
00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:57.190
it's been this long and I'm not getting an update like what's going on?

306
00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.550
And the first thing he writes is like,
I understand how frustrating that can be.

307
00:23:00.551 --> 00:23:04.960
And I'm like,
Oh God,
okay.
Yeah.
And he goes,

308
00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:09.700
let me see what's going on.
And I go,
it's been this long.

309
00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:14.880
And he then he writes me and drivers getting the food right now.
Right.

310
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:19.330
It was exactly driver's drivers in the food right now.
I'm like,
okay.
And he goes,

311
00:23:19.331 --> 00:23:24.280
how about I a refund like this or that?
And I go,
what does that amount to?

312
00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:28.090
And he goes $10.
And I'm like,
okay.

313
00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.930
And then I go,
you know that's weird cause the guy who I actually talked,

314
00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:36.100
I talked to the driver and I go,
it's weird that it's ready now.

315
00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:41.040
Cause he was saying a moment ago that he has to wait.
So I called the,

316
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:43.480
which keep in mind we've already been,
it's an hour,
right?

317
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:46.330
We've waited and usually the foods at your house at an hour.
Right.

318
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.040
So it's already been an hour has passed since we placed this order.

319
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:53.750
I call the driver and I go,
hey man,
do you have the food now?
And he goes,
no.

320
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:57.170
Like I said,
I have to wait cause it's so big.
And I go,

321
00:23:57.171 --> 00:24:00.780
so how long are you going to wait?
He's like,
it's going to be a while.
So then I,

322
00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:02.450
I messaged the guy,
go,
hey man,

323
00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:07.480
you just told me that the drivers getting the food right now and he's not like

324
00:24:07.581 --> 00:24:10.310
you just said that to kind of dismiss me.

325
00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:16.130
I called him out,
I go and that's not,
it's not cool to do that.
And he just,

326
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:20.720
he went silent and I checked the emblem of movie and you can see when like when

327
00:24:20.721 --> 00:24:24.770
they're writing,
it's just like an iPhone conversation and he just went,

328
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:25.663
he went dark.

329
00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:31.110
So I go at that point I was much more irritated by him bullshitting me.
Yeah.

330
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:35.630
Then yeah,
he lied.
This is with my phone by the way.
It is,

331
00:24:35.631 --> 00:24:36.464
it's all Christina.

332
00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:41.530
So then I started a new chat with a new person and this guy,

333
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:47.850
very nice guy.
I have to,
but I have to refer,
I have to inform him of a,

334
00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.300
of everything that happened cause I can go look at that chat.

335
00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.240
He looks at it and I'm telling him,

336
00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:56.600
the dude just told me that they picked up the food but he didn't.
I go,

337
00:24:56.601 --> 00:25:00.350
it's a lie.
It's a blatant lie and it's irritating.
And he goes,

338
00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:05.330
I understand how he retained that must feel.
And I'm like,
yeah man,

339
00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:09.240
it sucks.
Um,
and I go,
so what are you going to,
what?

340
00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:12.900
I go your $10 credit therapist where they pair it back to what you just said.

341
00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:15.890
Your $10 credit is not sufficient.
I don't want your $10 credit.

342
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.860
I go look at the amount of times I order.
Look at the amount of,

343
00:25:18.861 --> 00:25:21.260
I suppose it's not cool.
He live on door dash.

344
00:25:21.261 --> 00:25:25.580
Sometimes I go make it right and he goes seeing what I can do.
And then he goes,

345
00:25:25.581 --> 00:25:29.490
what if I could wave,
um,

346
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:34.880
five delivery fees and then a service fee?
And I go,

347
00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:39.350
nope.
And I know that they,
they're big.
You can tell,

348
00:25:39.351 --> 00:25:44.000
you can read into the training as you read conversations that their main thing

349
00:25:44.001 --> 00:25:48.980
is like,
don't give people refunds.
Don't give out money.
So the guy's like,

350
00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:54.020
oh yeah.
And he keeps avoiding answering my questions about refund.

351
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:59.120
Like I go,
um,
you know,
hey,
so what's up with this refund?

352
00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:02.270
And he goes,
I just spoke to the driver.

353
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:05.330
If your food's going to be ready and you were like three exclamation points,

354
00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.040
like,
isn't that exciting?
And I go,

355
00:26:07.041 --> 00:26:10.670
you're not answering me with the question I just asked you because he's keeps,

356
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:15.050
I'm working on this for you.
And then he asked me something else and I go again,

357
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:19.030
can we do the refund?
And it just was over it over and over.
And then he,

358
00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.710
then you could tell,
he goes,
I can offer a 50% refund.

359
00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:25.600
I was so exhausted at that point that I go fine.
Like just take it,
take it again.

360
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:29.480
That's why I gave the phone to you.
It was like an hour.

361
00:26:29.481 --> 00:26:31.300
It was through so much work.

362
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:36.350
I was willing to just take the extra hour way and be like,
whatever dude,

363
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:40.960
just fucking get in the end.
What hungry I didn't realize was the do.

364
00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.130
You did somehow ordered a party's work

365
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:50.930
<v 3>so much and thank God they gave us that credit because it's been a fortunate</v>

366
00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.540
what happened there?
I,

367
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.700
here's what I think it was when I opened and I was like what the I know cause I

368
00:26:56.701 --> 00:26:58.190
showed you the order in the car.
I remember it.

369
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.840
So here's what I was driving and I was a baby gene.
So we're,

370
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:04.770
we're in the car baby Jesus having a meltdown.
Yeah,
I'm starving.

371
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:08.520
We're about to get on the freeway and I'm thinking I'm going to order this

372
00:27:08.521 --> 00:27:12.840
dinner.
I'm going to be a fucking smart mom and an hour from now as we get home,

373
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.210
our dinner will be there.
I'll be,
everything will be great.

374
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.250
So I'm the kid kids crying.
I'm there.

375
00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:21.120
And I'm just like ordering Shit and I hand it to you look at this over does this

376
00:27:21.121 --> 00:27:23.430
look okay?
Yeah,
you're at a stop light.
We don't look it over.

377
00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:27.030
And I think what happened is they have this feature where you can look at the

378
00:27:27.031 --> 00:27:30.960
last order that you put and you can copy and paste it.

379
00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:33.270
And I think I looked at our previous order,

380
00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:35.790
I didn't think that I had submitted it again,

381
00:27:35.791 --> 00:27:40.791
but maybe I'd submitted the previous order and on top of that and a new order of

382
00:27:41.221 --> 00:27:44.910
a massive amount of food for people that don't order Sushi.
Massive.

383
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:48.720
It was mass me tell.
So people that don't know when you order Sushi,

384
00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:51.540
there's a god.
So say it wrong.

385
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:55.260
Negretti right Nigga you and is Uri.
You say it.

386
00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:57.420
I think the g is hard.
Okay.

387
00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:02.640
And I g g two GS.
Two GS.

388
00:28:02.641 --> 00:28:06.060
You fucking racist.
Yes.
No,
I just want you to pronounce it that way.

389
00:28:06.061 --> 00:28:10.710
It's phonetic.
I'm spelling it out.
Big words.
Hi the Gary.

390
00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:14.630
That's what it is,
Nigga.
Sorry.
Oh No,
no,
don't please say it.

391
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:18.160
The way I say it isn't a Gary,

392
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:22.200
this is Shimi and there's a Shimmy and there's roles,
right?
Yeah.

393
00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:27.180
<v 4>So,
but like you know,
if you really enjoy the fish portion of the things,</v>

394
00:28:27.181 --> 00:28:31.050
you're getting Sashimi,
which is just fish,
no rice or new Gary,

395
00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:36.090
which is a slice of fish on a piece of like a ball of rice basically.

396
00:28:36.091 --> 00:28:40.890
Right?
So when you order McGarry,
which is the fish and the rice and you say,

397
00:28:40.891 --> 00:28:43.290
I want one order,
that's two pieces,
right?

398
00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:47.160
So generally let's say it's a couple people you maybe you get two orders of a

399
00:28:47.161 --> 00:28:51.780
fish you really like.
So that's four pieces,
right?
It's always times two.

400
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:55.980
But like if you just go,
Oh let's try this,
you order one,
you each get a piece.

401
00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.840
I OVN they bring in like they give us like eight styrofoam

402
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.640
<v 3>pockets.
So vast.
I opened chopsticks and</v>

403
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:09.490
<v 4>I see 12 pieces of salmon,
just salmon.</v>

404
00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:10.780
And I'm like,
um,

405
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:14.980
which means that's six orders of Salmon.

406
00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:17.770
Niggery Sushi open the next box.

407
00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:22.980
Same thing with yellow tail tuna.
I'm like,
what did you do so much?

408
00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:26.920
And at first,
you know,
cause we've been waiting long were emotional.

409
00:29:26.921 --> 00:29:31.750
I'm like we're going to tear this shit up.
Go through a few.
Ah Ha.

410
00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:35.320
You know a few bites of this people answer that was totally defeated by this

411
00:29:35.321 --> 00:29:39.160
order.
I mean it's down.
It took us down.
Not just took us down.

412
00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:42.340
I refrigerated you fucking a hundred

413
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:46.720
<v 0>pieces of Sushi and then uh,
today lunch,
um,</v>

414
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:50.800
before you got here,
I open the fridge.
I see six boxes of,

415
00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:54.840
of Styrofoam.
I aid,
I don't know as much as I could again.

416
00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.990
And I still didn't get it cause I was hoping you'd go back for your second

417
00:29:58.991 --> 00:30:03.910
dinner.
Dinner is Sushi is like air.

418
00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:06.790
Yeah.
It goes like you didn't go back for a second.
You're tired man.

419
00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:12.070
Do you want us to do yesterday?
That was fucking horrible.
So much food.
Too much.

420
00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:17.110
But I still think the guys are Shit Dick for lying about that.
That is not cool.

421
00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.650
Especially from,
uh,

422
00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:22.240
because you know you're going to get angry or actually if I didn't know,

423
00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:26.200
I'd be even angrier that I,
that he had been like,
oh your food's coming.

424
00:30:26.201 --> 00:30:27.220
And I was like,
oh,
okay.

425
00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:30.670
And then you just sit there and then an hour later I would have been like,
hey,

426
00:30:30.671 --> 00:30:31.960
where are you?
He's like,
I'm waiting on their food.

427
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.540
I've seen that guy's an asshole.
I think you're right.

428
00:30:34.541 --> 00:30:37.960
I think he's an asshole too.
I want to find out where he lives.
Yeah.

429
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:43.480
Well thank God we got $400 off or serious.
That was a lot,

430
00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:48.220
I guess.
Holy Molly.
Yeah.
I had an addendum to that.

431
00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:53.020
Oh no I did not.
I didn't.
You didn't even,
uh,
you've been watching homeland.

432
00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:57.760
Oh my God.
Finally into it.
I got to say a couple of things.
First of all,
I'm,

433
00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:02.850
I actually really am a fan of getting into shows a few seasons after that,

434
00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:07.510
it's really much more fun,
dies down,
and then he could just like enjoy it.

435
00:31:07.511 --> 00:31:11.350
You can watch seasons,
not just like,
we did that with the Americans,

436
00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:14.890
which was so great and you could just go one season,
two season.

437
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:18.910
I'm in there now with homeland.
I'm losing my mind.
I'm uh,

438
00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:24.330
I'm almost done with season two and did the JV season's even and I think he

439
00:31:25.811 --> 00:31:30.200
disagrees.
Remember lots of bird one and two are the best seasons outlets.

440
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:34.510
That's what birds always say.
He watched it on his,
in his nest.
Yeah,

441
00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.270
I don't think so.
I I like the later ones personally theories,

442
00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:43.090
but like I don't want to ruin anything to know.
But Tom is up now.

443
00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:46.370
You know,
we have to wake up early with this baby jeans.
I like,
I,

444
00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.690
I've have like seven in the morning.
I usually get up at eight and you're,

445
00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:54.670
you've been up fighting the terrorists until one 30 in the morning.
I'll be,

446
00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:56.080
I'll get up to pee and I'm like,

447
00:31:56.110 --> 00:32:01.040
you're still watching homeland like you've blown well I know because seasons and

448
00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:05.680
they fuck you because they're starts.
I go with the editors with every episode,

449
00:32:05.681 --> 00:32:06.840
Angela like Ah,
Shit.

450
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:11.500
Like if it was a normal time of watching it as an air and I'd be like,

451
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:12.580
oh great,
next time.

452
00:32:12.581 --> 00:32:16.810
But I have the whole fucking library and I just get to the library.

453
00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.890
I get to just press the next one on.

454
00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:22.210
And then what I've been doing is just cutting myself off.

455
00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:27.240
Like last night I could have gone to bed so early I was so tired and had 1130

456
00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:29.610
who's in the middle of an episode.
I go,

457
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:33.410
I just got to have to pull the plug to it free.
I force myself to turn it.

458
00:32:33.411 --> 00:32:37.240
It's a long day.
We had a long week.
Wow.
Okay.

459
00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:40.070
Well I'm glad that you had the self discipline and know

460
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:43.880
<v 3>to pull the plug on the episodes.
I had to do that too.
It's such a,</v>

461
00:32:43.881 --> 00:32:48.350
the way that they,
they close out one episode.
It just,
they're so good.

462
00:32:48.351 --> 00:32:51.170
The writing on it,
right.
Such a cliffhanger.
You're like,
oh,

463
00:32:51.171 --> 00:32:54.140
I got to know what I wasn't going to have an to carry.
Now,

464
00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:56.110
<v 4>by the way,
um,</v>

465
00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:02.990
the Ebeneezer storylines routing sarge browser,
so crit,

466
00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:04.350
I don't wanna give away.
I'm,

467
00:33:04.351 --> 00:33:09.351
I'm just recommending to listeners who maybe have not explored the show to give

468
00:33:10.261 --> 00:33:14.730
it a shot.
It's really well done.
I'm kicking Bitsy,
right?
Oh God.
Oh yeah.

469
00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:18.280
<v 3>Rubbing her belly was my friend.
She didn't even care.
This is the most easy.</v>

470
00:33:18.281 --> 00:33:22.480
She ended up actually for bitsy update.
You know,
we've got our,
uh,

471
00:33:22.481 --> 00:33:26.980
about a year and change ago and she was a horrible dog for about a year and now

472
00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:32.050
it's annoying,
annoying way she'd shoot.
I mean she still choose a lot of shit,

473
00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:37.180
but just high energy would never chill.
Now she's pretty good.

474
00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:38.740
She ended up to being a great dog.

475
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:42.760
She's under my feet right now and I'm just rubbing her and she doesn't fucking

476
00:33:42.761 --> 00:33:46.060
care.
She loves it.
She loves it.
She's so easy going.

477
00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.860
The is good girl.
She's a sweet girl.

478
00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:54.310
She still eats everything like a dummy.
They just got diarrhea.
I like rocks.

479
00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.540
They both had diarrhea.
These dogs.

480
00:33:58.700 --> 00:33:59.930
<v 4>Really cool.
By the way,</v>

481
00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:05.210
Blue Band pointed out to me that when we played beardo from a mom,

482
00:34:05.211 --> 00:34:09.670
Australia teaching a Latin class on how to say bird is fat.
Uh,

483
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:10.611
we missed,

484
00:34:10.611 --> 00:34:15.320
we were laughing so hard that we missed a little exchange of it.

485
00:34:15.321 --> 00:34:19.700
I'll play the whole thing for you right now.
That's so fucking funny.

486
00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.750
<v 7>So let's say we are describing people in Latin.
We're using adjectives,</v>

487
00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.090
let's say the adjective or basis.

488
00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:33.830
Let's try this and that.
The sentence,
so I'll put this on the blog.

489
00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:38.840
Let's say Bob's Chrysler or basis.

490
00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.020
Can everyone say that together?

491
00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:51.940
Very good.
Just some cute factor.

492
00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:58.030
<v 3>So last week,</v>

493
00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:03.060
<v 4>well,
we played that.
We laughed so hard at the kids or the class saying it.</v>

494
00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:06.600
We missed that.
Whose bar?
Just some huge fat guy.

495
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:07.543
<v 7>All right,</v>

496
00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:15.100
very good.
Just some cute factor.

497
00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.870
<v 3>I just started to bark a moment ago.</v>

498
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:24.290
<v 4>He was saying that,
uh,</v>

499
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:28.400
when he was in Montreal for the festival awhile back.

500
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:32.730
<v 3>I bet.
I'm sure he did.
I'm</v>

501
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:36.690
<v 4>sure he did.
But he goes to everywhere I walked.
If somebody,</v>

502
00:35:36.691 --> 00:35:38.010
if I seen someone in a while,
they'd be

503
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:42.000
<v 0>like,
hey man,
Tom is fucking fat.
But that's how they greet him.</v>

504
00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.700
They're like,
he's way fucking fire that you do it.

505
00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:50.010
That was the greeting he got from people he hadn't seen in a year.

506
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:54.970
That your way fatter than him.
Patently false.
But I mean,
I know,

507
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:56.730
but they're,
you know,
they're face to face with them.

508
00:35:56.731 --> 00:35:59.970
Can you imagine how much fatter you got in Montreal?

509
00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:03.540
When we went last year,
I was pregnant.
Five months pregnant.
Yeah.

510
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:07.670
And every 10 steps,
there's a preteen,
there's everything and your booze and you,

511
00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:11.790
if you're not pregnant,
you just booze it up all week.
Yeah.
Like every night.

512
00:36:11.791 --> 00:36:13.440
What you do is you do your shows and you guys,

513
00:36:13.441 --> 00:36:17.070
you want to get fucking hammered and everyone just drinks and then you eat on

514
00:36:17.071 --> 00:36:17.491
top of that.

515
00:36:17.491 --> 00:36:20.820
And then you go to bed till late night eating the eating before the drinking.

516
00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:25.500
I remember every two steps,
there's a waffle place.
Yes.
And I would just,
you know,

517
00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.780
he's so much fatter this week after her.

518
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:31.780
<v 4>Oh yeah.
Yeah,
I bet.
Yeah.
You've gotta be,</v>

519
00:36:31.781 --> 00:36:35.000
it's one of the first guys ever won the fast guys.
And the business is what the,

520
00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:38.260
is what they say.
That's what's on his bio now.
Um,

521
00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:42.330
and did you see this by the way?
Um,

522
00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:47.770
let me pull this over here.
You're going to shit your pants.

523
00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:51.520
This is fucking real.
And No,

524
00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:56.580
I did not do this,
but it is,
uh,

525
00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:02.770
let me see.
I Babette is fired up about about bots is fat.
But the bad,

526
00:37:02.771 --> 00:37:07.420
the bad.
But a man,
sorry,
it's fine listening.
I know,

527
00:37:07.421 --> 00:37:09.620
but I'm trying to do something just to be a pound.

528
00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:12.490
This is a website.

529
00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:25.270
It's a,
it's burned chrysler.com B,
u r n t

530
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:29.260
<v 0>pfizer.com and by the way,</v>

531
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.930
yes you see that as our bird is fat shirt is here.

532
00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:36.620
<v 4>I didn't set this up.
What's crazy?</v>

533
00:37:36.621 --> 00:37:40.310
So I think someone else made a website to what really?

534
00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.080
Is this from the cheat sheet or is this a different one?
No,
no.
Oh No.
I just,

535
00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:44.550
somebody messaged me this,
this is

536
00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:48.310
<v 0>GG because someone made one that looks different than this.
Oh my God,</v>

537
00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:52.080
there's two websites now and this end like they are linking it.
Yeah,

538
00:37:52.081 --> 00:37:56.550
they link it to my page but I didn't,
my God,
I didn't do this man.
Dude,

539
00:37:56.551 --> 00:38:00.960
this has taken on a life of its own and it has an about me section on it.

540
00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.180
Oh my.
And then I saw in the end here goes,

541
00:38:03.181 --> 00:38:05.570
he is widely recognized as the fattest comedian

542
00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:11.530
in comparison to the current water champion.
And physically fit comedy.
Um,

543
00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:15.960
cigarettes and then it's every Hashtag bird is fat tweet.
Oh,

544
00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:22.020
why gun?
I mean,
it's a well made website.

545
00:38:22.021 --> 00:38:25.760
It's really well made.
It must be Squarespace.
I was going to say,
Oh man,

546
00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.780
that looks like so there's another one.

547
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:32.390
<v 4>Really?
Oh my God.
It was insane.</v>

548
00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:36.130
<v 0>Look at the quote here,
Tom Segura in better shape</v>

549
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:39.610
<v 3>and a better athlete.
He's a beast.
Stuart Scott dead.</v>

550
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:48.320
<v 4>Yeah.
Did they have like,
this is like on a loop.
This video of his,</v>

551
00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:53.100
what happens with hit Burdis fatter.
I Dunno.
Oh,
it just goes,
okay.

552
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:57.470
Why Burns fat or that is unreal,
man.

553
00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:01.490
Unreal.
That's like when I tell him I go,
dude,

554
00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:05.990
you know it's not,
this isn't like,
sorry guys,
I got a high grade.
You know,

555
00:39:05.991 --> 00:39:09.020
this isn't like,
this is way bigger than,
than me being like,
Hey,

556
00:39:09.021 --> 00:39:12.620
you should do this.
I'm a fan man.
Oh,

557
00:39:12.621 --> 00:39:16.260
this is drinking water right now.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
This is the other website.

558
00:39:16.261 --> 00:39:19.680
And then you said a fan almost done with that one.
The other one's gone.

559
00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:25.910
This is ridiculous.
The first website that,
that he made.
Oh my God.

560
00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:27.800
I literally took a website making to make.

561
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.930
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
What is that picture?
Oh,</v>

562
00:39:29.931 --> 00:39:34.250
that's me and Kyrgyzstan of all things next to water.
Oh,
that's hilarious.

563
00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:37.440
How did that picture on that website?
Oh,

564
00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:40.250
Christina didn't even know this exists.

565
00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:43.520
Christina has claimed to be the water champion yet research hardly shows are

566
00:39:43.521 --> 00:39:47.270
concerned for coffee.
Yes.
Beer.
Oh yeah.
Some bounce up.

567
00:39:47.271 --> 00:39:52.100
It looks like Maltipoo and a cup,
unfortunately.
Um,
wow.

568
00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:55.820
This is really interesting.
How do people find?
They have little details.
Yeah.

569
00:39:55.880 --> 00:40:00.260
And it's called water champion.
mommy.com.
So funny.
Oh wait,

570
00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:03.230
there's water champion.
Oh,
how funny.
And then here's my water.

571
00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:08.680
Tarrant water champion.
Our main,
yeah.
Bullshit.

572
00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:12.020
Yeah.
Look at that big fucking Mug of water right there,
please.

573
00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:16.730
Tommy remains Armani water chain.
Tommy's trophy in trouble.
Oh,
I like that.

574
00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:18.020
Let's look at that argument.

575
00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:23.040
<v 4>Oh man,
this is really,
really sad.
It's sad.</v>

576
00:40:23.041 --> 00:40:26.800
I was after I had Ellis embarrass him every day.
Uh,

577
00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:30.660
I want it links it to Tom.
Is Fat burners or how's that prior to the store?

578
00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.980
Thomas fat here.
We see.
Don't be fooled.

579
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:36.660
The jacket adds 40 pounds and it's hilarious.

580
00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.510
There's very little evidence that Tom is in fact fat

581
00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:46.100
<v 3>Tom Barely taking up a third of the frame.</v>

582
00:40:46.101 --> 00:40:51.101
He is so smelled wearing the short sleeves so we can see as massive pythons

583
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:55.800
letting the world know not to mess with this.
Mommy goes,
this is hilarious.

584
00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:59.630
And look at the water background.
Burt car company that went bankrupt.

585
00:40:59.631 --> 00:41:02.450
It's just downright fat.
Holy Shit.
Wow.

586
00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:08.690
We have the best fans.
Look at this.
Look at this.
Oh,
we can not fit another photo.

587
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:14.160
That's better as he is too fat and we do not have room on the right.

588
00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:19.040
You guys are hilarious.
We have the best fans.
Our show has the best fans ever.

589
00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:23.480
I think I was looking at are the emails that people made artwork for the

590
00:41:23.481 --> 00:41:26.080
Cincinnati far they made that um,

591
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:31.070
Instagram meme I put up about you when you nut and she keeps sucking and yeah,

592
00:41:31.071 --> 00:41:34.250
they crazy.
You make that me?
No,
no,
no.
It was sent in through Melissa.
I think

593
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.160
<v 0>the,
uh,
Shane.
Shane McCleary.
I think managed funds.
So funny.
Yeah.</v>

594
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:43.040
<v 4>By the way,
a listener email,
he'll hear it.
Mommy's,</v>

595
00:41:43.041 --> 00:41:47.240
I recently saw a rebroadcast of burnt Chrysler's periscope in the video called

596
00:41:47.241 --> 00:41:51.050
working out five minutes in burnt is wearing some kind of weather balloon suit

597
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:54.830
while claiming to be the real water champ and claiming that little baby jeans

598
00:41:54.831 --> 00:41:57.680
Ellis is fake shocked and in disbelief.

599
00:41:57.681 --> 00:41:59.810
I almost spit my water out and loosened my jeans.

600
00:41:59.811 --> 00:42:03.440
He was taking a lot of brown talking.
A lot of Brown said Ellis was just a bit.

601
00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:07.460
Wow.
Please confirm.
This is Ellis real love you Ollie.

602
00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:12.470
[inaudible] oh yeah.
Hey Ali.
First of all,
you're such a talented musician.

603
00:42:12.471 --> 00:42:15.710
Thank you very much for all your submissions.
We love you.
Um,

604
00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:20.180
I think if you listen to last week's episode where we brought baby jeans in the

605
00:42:20.181 --> 00:42:22.940
office,
he,
he barely made a peep,
but you can tell there's a little baby.

606
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:27.310
<v 0>He's sitting on my lap.
He just woke up from his nap and he just,
you know,</v>

607
00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:29.260
hold on.
I'm like just,
I don't know.

608
00:42:29.261 --> 00:42:32.800
We've always felt like it's weird to post pictures of your children.

609
00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.280
I feel like we're in show business and,
and not our son,

610
00:42:36.281 --> 00:42:38.830
like if he wants to be when he's older.
Great.
But I don't,

611
00:42:38.831 --> 00:42:42.820
I don't think it's fair to him to like water champions also yogurt champion

612
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:47.350
Shit.
Your mom who brought that up?
Blue van.

613
00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:51.850
Who brought that up earlier?
Oh,
fucking blue band.

614
00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:56.800
Who brought that here?
Just tell the truth.
No one's asking you to lie.
Chris.

615
00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:01.950
Thank you Hank.
You,
you're such a,

616
00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:06.480
you lie to them.
You lie.
Tastes like Juju has.

617
00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:10.420
It's so yummy.
It's so stupid.

618
00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:15.700
Once your colonoscopy it's on the 16th.
Nice.
I can't wait.

619
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:20.710
Yeah,
popup bad is back up above about,
but thank you Ali.
Um,
yes,

620
00:43:20.711 --> 00:43:25.450
we have a real son.
His name is Ellis and um,
he's just eight months old.

621
00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:29.200
He just eight months this week.
Yup.
Duties.
He's Rad.
He's,

622
00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:33.670
he's the best thing we ever did.
Yeah,
I mean I did it.
He didn't really do much.

623
00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:37.360
I Dunno.
My specialist,
I'm really proud of.
Sorry.

624
00:43:37.361 --> 00:43:40.690
So what does that have to do with our son?
He said the best thing I ever did,

625
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:44.880
I was thinking your career stuff.
You think that the next time

626
00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:52.180
it is healthy,
right?
Yeah.
Can we talk about,

627
00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:56.380
are we talking about what we're doing now?

628
00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:59.730
I want to tell the story about,
we're looking at houses.
Yeah.

629
00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:05.080
So we've decided to look to buy a home,
right?
Cause we rent a house and renting.

630
00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:08.350
It sucks.
I don't want to have a fucking landlord anymore.
It's terrible.

631
00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:12.620
I remember we saw that house that was such a fucking dog shit.
Yes.

632
00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:16.100
And like which one?
I know you hate that.

633
00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:19.870
That's what you're talking about with the way is like,
let's go

634
00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:24.580
the lady we walk in the house.
First of all you were behind,

635
00:44:24.581 --> 00:44:28.630
but I walked in with our,
with the showing agent,

636
00:44:28.631 --> 00:44:31.500
the showing agent show opened the door and

637
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.340
<v 4>the lady was down there and bullied or looked back.
She was like,
oh.</v>

638
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.420
And showing she goes,
oh,

639
00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:43.350
she sounded what?
What race does she sound?
Oh

640
00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:49.310
no,
because she was Asian and the,

641
00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:52.050
and um,

642
00:44:58.620 --> 00:44:59.453
<v 0>he just did it.</v>

643
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:04.740
<v 4>No,
she goes,
oh mom.
The lady goes,
I didn't know you were a home.</v>

644
00:45:04.741 --> 00:45:07.500
You're never home at this hour.
And she goes,
oh,
I'll go upstairs.

645
00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:12.920
So we start walking around and you know,

646
00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:16.710
we walked through the living room and the dining room and then we get to the

647
00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:19.840
section,
you're depressing houses.
Yeah.

648
00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:23.730
And furniture and depressing.
Depressing,
you know,

649
00:45:23.731 --> 00:45:28.380
design and it's just,
yeah,
it's a true life.
Don't take some pride in your home.

650
00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:32.070
So we sit in the kitchen and then as we're walking through to the stairs,

651
00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:34.501
and I'm glad you did it,

652
00:45:34.501 --> 00:45:37.140
cause I was just going to do the thing where I can go and I'm working and I'm

653
00:45:37.141 --> 00:45:41.700
carrying our son.
You Go,
uh,
we can just go.
And she goes,

654
00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:45.880
she goes,
all right.
And she goes,
uh,
thank you.
Uh,

655
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:49.260
and the lady goes,
oh,
okay.

656
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:54.610
<v 0>She was acknowledging,
Oh,
you're saying that downstairs sucks so bad.</v>

657
00:45:55.390 --> 00:46:00.350
You don't even want to come upstairs.
Oh,
okay.
And those other ones that we,

658
00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.020
toward the bathroom,

659
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.130
remember we went upstairs where the guy has shirtless pictures of himself with

660
00:46:06.131 --> 00:46:10.150
the children
sitting on the couch,
not like on a beach,

661
00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:12.920
sitting on his couch,
shirtless with his kids.
I'm like,

662
00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:16.750
my dad and I did a Christmas card when I'm seven years old.

663
00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:21.190
He's shirtless in it and we're sending in front of the fireplace.
He's shirtless.

664
00:46:21.191 --> 00:46:25.240
I'm standing in front of him at Dick Level and I'm holding my cabbage patch
doll.

665
00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:28.660
And he sent that to are like everybody weird.
I got to find it,

666
00:46:28.661 --> 00:46:31.150
I'm going to find it and I'll,
I'll show you the picture.
It's horrible.

667
00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:35.570
<v 4>The,
um,
maybe they're a European,
you know,
but that one,</v>

668
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:39.570
we just checked out the master and I was like,
they had like

669
00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:44.470
<v 0>dark purple walls.
It's just weird.
There's ledges that don't,</v>

670
00:46:44.471 --> 00:46:46.720
you're like,
what goes up there?
They're like,
it's just a design

671
00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:50.740
<v 4>idea when you think it looks terrible.
And we just walk,</v>

672
00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:54.230
we go start walking down the stairs.
You Go,
thank you.
And that's,
that's,

673
00:46:54.730 --> 00:46:58.060
that means like,
I don't like it,
but done.
So like a polite way.

674
00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:01.030
And that real estate person was also like,
oh,

675
00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:04.060
well thank you.

676
00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:09.100
And then there's so defeated when you,
when your enthusiasm dies,
you know?

677
00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:13.190
<v 0>Well,
I don't like to waste my time.
It was 110 degree.
Right?
We had the baby,</v>

678
00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:16.460
you know,
you and I were taking turns carrying baby genes through these homes.

679
00:47:16.461 --> 00:47:19.790
And it's not like you can take a stroller if you looking at two story homes or

680
00:47:19.791 --> 00:47:23.690
stairs.
So we had to,
like,
I had to wear the hippy Moby wrap,

681
00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:27.050
put him in and I was,
my back was hurting,
so I was like,
all right,

682
00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:31.420
let's fucking wrap this up.
I ain't fucking for a home.
We,
you know,

683
00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:35.200
a lot of people buy homes in certain parts of the country,

684
00:47:35.201 --> 00:47:39.010
like in their twenties.
Oh my gosh.
Yeah.
We're,
you know,

685
00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:41.680
I'm approaching,
I'm seven years younger than you,

686
00:47:41.681 --> 00:47:46.270
but you fucking lie so much on the show.
But I,
uh,

687
00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:48.620
we've never bought a house when we still haven't been the first time.

688
00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:52.610
This would be,
it's a daunting undertaking to buy a house.
You know,

689
00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:56.770
one house we saw,
you know how it looks great on the inner webs and you're like,

690
00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:00.400
this is going to be awesome.
And you show up and you're like,
my fuck.
They got me.

691
00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:04.510
Yeah,
they tricked me.
And then you go in and one of them smelled like dog piss.

692
00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:08.470
Remember like somebody just let their dogs pass all over their house for like 15

693
00:48:08.471 --> 00:48:11.530
years.
What are you doing?
How do you let that happen?

694
00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:16.540
It's just unsanitary stuff like dude or like my favorite is on these sites like

695
00:48:16.541 --> 00:48:20.380
Zillow within the on there constantly where um,

696
00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.500
they don't hire a professional to take the photo.

697
00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:27.490
Like I'm just going to take fucking iPhone pictures.
Like what are you doing?

698
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.570
Fucking punished.
Yes.
Top,

699
00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:35.830
like the right thing to do is either just hire someone to do,

700
00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:39.520
use a nice camera,
aims are really nice camera and put up a nice photos.

701
00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:42.370
People will walk up to their lamp,

702
00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:47.160
snap a photo of it with their iPhone or fucking chair.
What are you doing?

703
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:49.570
Just the bed.
You're like,
are you selling the bed too?

704
00:48:49.571 --> 00:48:54.160
And then part of the home and they'll have the drapes closed,
lights off.

705
00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:58.690
It was barely light in the room and they upload that photo and you're like,
what?

706
00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:03.390
And then you see like 2.9 million.
Okay asshole.

707
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:07.780
I now like no one knows your house.
So delusional.

708
00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.270
You can always tell the house as a turn.
I've learned on these,

709
00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:11.830
on these real estate websites,

710
00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:17.220
if they do external shot of the house at nighttime with the lights on inside.

711
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.510
Yeah,
it's a Turd.
If they lead with the backyard picture,
it's a Turd.

712
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:26.980
Sure.
That's nine times out of 10.
That's what I've learned
now.

713
00:49:26.981 --> 00:49:29.720
That was an interesting one.
It doesn't sound like the others,

714
00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:38.870
like a person was coming out of his stomach like a soul escapes though.

715
00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:42.820
Let's talk about the lead photos.
That is a good thing.

716
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.000
If your lead profile photo on real estate is a night shot up,

717
00:49:48.211 --> 00:49:48.950
that's what it was.
I know.

718
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:53.320
A nice shot up the pool shot or um,

719
00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:58.560
or no,
or if the,
if your lead shot is indoors.
Yeah.
That's all.

720
00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:02.100
So that means this place.
Yeah.
Yeah.

721
00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:06.390
Here's a indicator that's good.
It's outdoors.
It's the,

722
00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:10.720
it's the picture of the home.
The House Day time lit,
daytime,

723
00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:14.230
noon.
It's fucking high noon.
See what this house looks like.

724
00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:17.860
Exactly.
They're trying to trick you.

725
00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.350
Sometimes there is like a tree in a corner of the house be like,

726
00:50:20.351 --> 00:50:23.230
what's the fuck are you avoiding?
Right.
Yeah.
You'd think you slick.

727
00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:25.070
You got the full,
yeah.

728
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:32.150
Does he know I play a black woman on 10 Parnelli video game 2004 it was my first

729
00:50:32.151 --> 00:50:32.871
voiceover gig.

730
00:50:32.871 --> 00:50:36.950
Did you know that sound like you're a marking marking people right there.

731
00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:38.673
<v 8>I wasn't at</v>

732
00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.870
<v 0>it sounded like that was,
that was a joke.
I was being jokey.
Okay.</v>

733
00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:48.240
That's not my authentic black woman's voice.
I have a different authentic,

734
00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:52.930
you sounded like you like it was,
I was offended.
Oh,
you're offended.
Yes.

735
00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:55.950
Interesting.
Speaking of being offended,
my documentary,

736
00:50:55.951 --> 00:50:59.730
can we take a joke came out this week and Tom and I went to the premiere.

737
00:50:59.731 --> 00:51:02.650
Really great jeans.
I'm so fried.
Oh,
I think it's,
well,

738
00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:08.110
you narrated the film in your narrow ray rated and you're not black voice in

739
00:51:08.341 --> 00:51:12.930
your white alive woman voice my lane voice.
Yeah,

740
00:51:12.931 --> 00:51:16.830
and it was,
you did such a good job.
Oh,
thank you.
The film was really,

741
00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:21.090
really great,
especially for comedy fans and you can start,

745
00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:36.640

Can we take a joke,
Ted Balak or directed it and your jeans.

746
00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:41.770
Jim Norton's in at Lisa Lampanelli.
I'm trying to remember.

747
00:51:41.830 --> 00:51:44.430
Gilbert cops who steals the show.

748
00:51:44.431 --> 00:51:47.970
I think he did such a great job and it's about the first amendment stuff.

749
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.630
It is a speaking a lot of Lenny Bruce stuff in there.
It's really great.

750
00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:53.760
Please support this film.

751
00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:57.180
I think it's one of my favorite things I've ever worked on besides your mom's

752
00:51:57.181 --> 00:52:00.810
house.
Obviously you are so cute at the premiere.

753
00:52:00.811 --> 00:52:04.290
You wear your sexy dad glasses and we took pictures.

754
00:52:04.291 --> 00:52:07.380
You can see them on my Instagram of sexy dad.

755
00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:10.260
What's your dad doing this sexy thing?
Yeah,
like a little date night.

756
00:52:10.261 --> 00:52:14.200
It was nice to go out with you and you do the Q and a afterwards murder that

757
00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:16.680
you're sweet.
You did great.
It was mortifying.

758
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:19.110
I don't want to the only comic on stage because people were like,

759
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:23.120
that was a good point.
And then you were making a funny thank you.
I love you.

760
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:26.550
I'd like to say Mary t for another week or so.

761
00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:31.760
Well would you like to stay married to me longer if I were a bad boy?

762
00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:37.660
<v 8>Are a lot of things smart,
funny,
reliable,
even charming,</v>

763
00:52:37.690 --> 00:52:41.390
but a bad boy.
You are not and neither am I a bad boys.

764
00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:46.240
The guy that all the ladies love and all the dudes like you and me,
we hate.

765
00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:47.950
Look that screams,

766
00:52:47.951 --> 00:52:52.000
I'm going to break your heart and women are powerless against this bad boy

767
00:52:52.001 --> 00:52:53.620
bravado.
But Gentlemen,

768
00:52:53.621 --> 00:52:58.120
I'm here to tell you by creatively utilizing the right accessory,

769
00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:02.770
we can trick the shit out of some people.
I love this guy.
Remember that guy?

770
00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:03.790
No,
I'm serious.

771
00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:08.380
<v 0>Cause there was that TV show mystery.
Yes.
Because here's why.</v>

772
00:53:08.381 --> 00:53:11.260
He's right.
Women are very superficial.
No,
hear me out.

773
00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:16.480
Women are very superficial and a lot of good guys get overlooked because they

774
00:53:16.481 --> 00:53:20.920
don't meet the quote.
Look that a lot of dumb slots like thank you,
the end,

775
00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:25.620
you should be encouraging everybody you know to not listen.
This guy,

776
00:53:25.621 --> 00:53:28.230
this is the biggest douche bag of all time it wrong with you.

777
00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:32.910
He's teaching you how to look like a Douche bag to attract women and you think

778
00:53:32.911 --> 00:53:36.000
that's good advice.
I think in some cases that yeah,

779
00:53:36.001 --> 00:53:41.001
initially some guys need to a doll up their appearance to attract a woman.

780
00:53:42.070 --> 00:53:42.903
Yet

781
00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:48.170
those would be bad boys and get accessories to do it.
What is wrong with you?

782
00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:52.050
Dress like a Douche bag and then you can attract the girls to get laid.

783
00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:56.760
And again,
this is like you're signing off on that mystery.
Remember that TV show?

784
00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:59.030
Yes,
of course.
The same thing.
I remember he said,

785
00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:03.440
<v 8>flowers,
I've already covered how to develop that signature bad boy.</v>

786
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:06.590
Lucky you've got your bad boys signature style.
Great,

787
00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:11.390
but accessorization putting the icing on the bad boy style.

788
00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:18.360
<v 0>Accessorization you're not cringing at this guy really now because I think he</v>

789
00:54:19.871 --> 00:54:23.790
has a point and I think he's absolutely right.
I think I need to meet,

790
00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:26.770
what are you talking about?
Jealous.
Can I point something out?

791
00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:31.150
I think you're just jealous because you're a sexy dad and you've learned how to

792
00:54:31.151 --> 00:54:35.470
sexify or data PR in.
This guys figured it out for the single guy.

793
00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:39.820
Oh my God,
he's right.
Some boys need help.
They don't need this help.

794
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:42.550
How do you not,
how can you not tie that together?

795
00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:47.060
This isn't the help the blue band could use like a cold or cough.
No,

796
00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:49.563
I got,

797
00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:53.600
<v 8>yeah,
right.
So first let's go over some bad boy accessory don'ts.</v>

798
00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:57.540
Bad Boys don't wear tow rings.
If you're currently wearing a toe ring,

799
00:54:57.570 --> 00:55:01.080
turn the video off and go change your dress because bad boys,

800
00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:04.650
they don't wear to tow rings and they most certainly don't wear ankle bracelets.

801
00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:06.210
<v 0>True.
Yup.
That's great.</v>

802
00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:10.780
Are you sad boy Tom Trento rings on right now

803
00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:16.240
<v 8>as a general bad boy accessory rule of thumb.</v>

804
00:55:16.241 --> 00:55:19.930
I would say avoid accessorizing anything below the waist.

805
00:55:19.931 --> 00:55:22.090
The exception would be if you have your junk pierce,

806
00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:26.980
and I'm assuming also that if you're man enough to pierce big Allen,
the twins,

807
00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:29.800
you're probably not watching my videos.
You,

808
00:55:29.801 --> 00:55:31.750
my friend are a bad boy through and through.

809
00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:35.320
You're the guy parents are worried about,
congratulations

810
00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:39.430
<v 0>God.
So worse on a fucking vomit in my mouth.</v>

811
00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:41.710
I think I also just think it's cute.
I'm into it.

812
00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:46.360
Never been so turned off by you and my entire life,

813
00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:52.490
the way he even says bad boy,
you're a bad boy.
I feel like,

814
00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:56.800
I feel like he just wants to stick his dick in some dude's mouth right now.

815
00:55:57.050 --> 00:56:01.300
He's like,
no,
I'm a bad boy.
I am a bad boy.
Yeah.
Okay.

816
00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:04.960
You don't sense that here?
No,
I don't get that.

817
00:56:04.961 --> 00:56:07.300
But if that's what you see in the collage,

818
00:56:07.301 --> 00:56:10.720
and I'll let you see that we project what we want to see.

819
00:56:11.170 --> 00:56:15.640
You don't think you want to like,
uh,
get over here to suck this Dick,
right?

820
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:19.090
I mean,
that's what you want to hear from fine.
That's what he wants.

821
00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:26.680
Maybe you want to,
it's like,
oh,
I

822
00:56:29.410 --> 00:56:33.970
can't believe you're into this fucking Douche bag.
So what is he advocating?

823
00:56:33.971 --> 00:56:38.380
He's saying that he's trying to be a bad boy and if you want to be a bad boy,

824
00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:42.280
get some fucking risks.
Fuck,
are you kidding me right now?

825
00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:48.670
You care.
Rage.
He's a douchebag and bad boys are Douche bags.

826
00:56:48.671 --> 00:56:51.900
But he's saying if you want to get laid,
you kind of have to bad boy.
Oh No,

827
00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:55.480
there's you.
You totally don't get it.
There's two.
There's all,

828
00:56:55.540 --> 00:57:00.460
there's genuine dudes who are douche bags.
Some are Douche bags,

829
00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:00.911
some,

830
00:57:00.911 --> 00:57:05.890
there are also like just actual Badass dudes out there where it's not a play.

831
00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:09.520
Like it's really who they are.
Right.
You can't mimic that.

832
00:57:09.810 --> 00:57:13.490
You can't teach that when you copy that you're a Douche bag.

833
00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:16.300
Like when you're trying to copy the guy who's genuinely like that,

834
00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:21.100
like you know like rock stars are like fucking,
they're real deal.

835
00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:23.060
But there are real deal rockstars.
Yeah,
exactly.

836
00:57:23.061 --> 00:57:28.061
Even Tyler and then like when you try to mimic a rock stars persona,

837
00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:30.070
you look like an asshole.

838
00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:35.020
Of course you don't have that swag inside of you that makes you that cool.

839
00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:38.950
All right,
so this guy is basically being like,
you should do that.

840
00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:42.430
You should try to imitate actual really cool,

841
00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:44.080
naturally cool people,

842
00:57:44.081 --> 00:57:48.250
which is like the grossest thing you could do and you're going to make people

843
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.140
even douchey or than they are the ones that sign up to do something like that.

844
00:57:53.141 --> 00:57:58.141
You know the tribe to try to imitate that girls dig bad boys and he's going to

845
00:57:59.351 --> 00:58:02.620
show it.
They'll going to go for the real bad boy.
They're going to go for,

846
00:58:02.621 --> 00:58:04.660
here's the thing though,
just hear me out.
Hear me out.

847
00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:10.470
What if there's a guy who's a sweet guy but as gears all whack,

848
00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:15.970
but he doesn't he this,
this is bad advice.
A little piece of flair,

849
00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:19.960
like not a leather cuff,

850
00:58:20.410 --> 00:58:24.200
but just like put some deer hair nicer.
But that's a different video.

851
00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:27.140
It's not this video.
It's not the bad boy video.
No,

852
00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:32.290
I don't want to see like just help these nerds,
you know?
Yeah.

853
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:35.860
This nerd.
That's the video I wanted.
So that's a totally different video though.

854
00:58:36.070 --> 00:58:37.570
That's the tallies up.
It is

855
00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:43.730
<v 8>pierced ears.
Another sorta on the fence.
Bad boy accessory.</v>

856
00:58:43.731 --> 00:58:47.060
I know some guys with the small gauges look super tough,

857
00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:50.570
but I am not a fan of stretching your ear lobes because eventually if you

858
00:58:50.571 --> 00:58:53.810
stretch them too much and you decide that you're not mad at your mom anymore,

859
00:58:53.811 --> 00:58:57.320
you're sharing lobes are going to look like stretched out buttholes and require

860
00:58:57.321 --> 00:58:58.154
surgery.

861
00:58:59.550 --> 00:59:00.383
<v 0>Not Bad.</v>

862
00:59:02.130 --> 00:59:03.220
<v 8>Says bad boy,</v>

863
00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:07.450
like a super cool ring brings are not only a great accessory there a great

864
00:59:07.451 --> 00:59:08.800
conversation starter.

865
00:59:09.350 --> 00:59:14.210
<v 0>Oh my God,
just for the record,
I hate bad boy.</v>

866
00:59:14.211 --> 00:59:18.450
You know that I've never dated a guy that wore a ring with an m.

867
00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:26.020
Yeah,
I don't see that at all and his energy,
but you keep playing what you want,

868
00:59:26.290 --> 00:59:30.850
<v 8>but my personal opinion,
there was no better way to say,
Yo,
I'm a bad boy.</v>

869
00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:34.030
Then wearing called bracelets.

870
00:59:34.090 --> 00:59:37.870
Bracelets are a great way to accessorize in a super cool way.

871
00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:41.500
He's right in casual clothes,
but you can also do it in dress clothes.

872
00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:46.270
It sends the message,
Yo,
I'm a bad boy.
Looks what's up.
I got bracelets on.

873
00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:49.900
Don't be afraid to wear multiple bracelets on the same wrist and mix your

874
00:59:49.901 --> 00:59:51.520
materials.
Right.
He got leather.

875
00:59:51.521 --> 00:59:55.090
This is just the scissor leather cord that I wrapped the few times around my

876
00:59:55.091 --> 00:59:55.630
wrist.

877
00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:59.350
I've got some cool beaded bracelets and these are super easy to make yourself.

878
00:59:59.530 --> 01:00:02.980
I actually did a video where I show you and teach you how to make these beads

879
01:00:03.130 --> 01:00:03.963
bracelets.

880
01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:08.790
There's a link county combined those bracelets with the super cool line and you

881
01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.260
are bad boy.
Perfection

882
01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:12.260
<v 0>Gun.
I only,
oh,</v>

883
01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:15.910
I can only hope that he just has a bracelet company and that's what this whole

884
01:00:15.911 --> 01:00:19.500
home,
so it basically is how to be a douchebag.
He's,

885
01:00:19.501 --> 01:00:22.490
he's telling you how to look at the leader of all the Douche bag.

886
01:00:23.050 --> 01:00:28.050
Nothing says it like it be ed boy because fucking horrific in northeastern North

887
01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:35.140
Atlantic accent like bad boy,
bad boy bracelets,

888
01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:38.950
Bray cds led their things here.
I just put them on myself.

889
01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.630
How can I make it really easy to make?

890
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:45.710
<v 10>My name is Joel Kramer and I'm a massage instructor with south anal massage.</v>

891
01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:49.860
You can reclaim an important part of yourself.

892
01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:53.620
<v 0>Oh yeah.
We haven't played this video in so long,</v>

893
01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:57.370
but it came to our attention.
We never did it with the video.
We couldn't see it.

894
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:59.010
Oh,
right now he can see this guy.

895
01:00:59.490 --> 01:01:02.490
<v 10>No little babies in choice.
They're assholes.</v>

896
01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:06.330
When you were very young,
who had no shame,

897
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:09.900
you certainly didn't carry tension in your sphincter muscles.

898
01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:14.540
We were taught that there are places on our body that we should avoid through

899
01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:17.280
the asshole is at the top of the list.

900
01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:19.720
<v 0>Good reasons.
I mean,
yeah,</v>

901
01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:22.970
but I do wish you would explore where this stuff comes out of there and really

902
01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:23.804
wish you would.

903
01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:31.900
You know why?
Because you're a bad boy.

904
01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:36.250
That's where bad boys like fingers to go
dirty places

905
01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:40.880
<v 10>till I was 30 years old,
I hated my asshole.</v>

906
01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:45.890
Hated it nonstop and flamed him.
Rides not fun.

907
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:46.820
Well that's why you hated it.

908
01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:52.260
Drew on my asshole bleeding demonstrated in this video I have to relax.

909
01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:01.280
<v 0>Stop saying Asshole Weirdo and his mustache doesn't help.</v>

910
01:02:01.281 --> 01:02:04.510
Matters is talking and like clinical terms and I

911
01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:11.470
need to say massage my amen.

912
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:12.720
Certainly.
I don't know.

913
01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:20.390
<v 10>I recommend clenching your ass hole in rhythm with your like to show you four,</v>

914
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:24.600
right?
I don't know.

915
01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.590
<v 0>It was edited out of order.
Right.</v>

916
01:02:27.591 --> 01:02:32.591
But I'm saying is the joke here is the thing how this video got like he was

917
01:02:32.691 --> 01:02:36.950
saying anus and they,
they made it sound like an asshole.
That's a good question.

918
01:02:36.951 --> 01:02:39.650
But it was just a castle from a different part.
Right,
right.

919
01:02:39.651 --> 01:02:44.340
And then just drop it in it cause it's really
that.

920
01:02:44.570 --> 01:02:49.210
He's like,
I never had any experiences with my ass hauled off.

921
01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:54.370
<v 10>The first is just a sigh.
Deep breath</v>

922
01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:02.900
on the inhale,
clench and on the exhale,
relax.
No.

923
01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:05.340
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

924
01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:06.840
<v 10>Ah,</v>

925
01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:10.290
<v 0>I would love to see you make love to this man.</v>

926
01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:17.340
Now I can't take it.
What did you take him or the bad boy?
Bad boy.

927
01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:22.620
I can't do this.
This is just experienced so much more pleasure with her city.

928
01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:26.220
He would totally get you your asshole tingling and you'd take his ass.

929
01:03:26.290 --> 01:03:27.900
You don't need my ass.
Hold a tingle.

930
01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:31.750
<v 10>The next breath is Clyde and clench faster.</v>

931
01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.490
All the efforts on the inhale.

932
01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:39.790
<v 0>Do it Tom,
to practice before your colonoscopy.</v>

933
01:03:40.810 --> 01:03:43.840
How does it feel?
I feel far.
Calvin.
Do I do it?

934
01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:45.013
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

935
01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:54.240
<v 10>The third breath breath.
I'm in.
Hell the double step.
So it's like this.</v>

936
01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:55.273
<v 6>Cool.</v>

937
01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:01.250
<v 10>It's really,
and you have two steps in your client.
These people.</v>

938
01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:04.100
Can I tell you some,
a lot of time,
right?
The fuck.

939
01:04:04.101 --> 01:04:06.750
Do you have time to worry about your hands?
Completely relaxed.

940
01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:09.270
I don't have time in my day to worry about and we can.

941
01:04:09.290 --> 01:04:13.080
How I've ignored my swa souls when we think we're relaxed,

942
01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:17.210
has too much time on his hands.
He ain't got no wife,
no kids.

943
01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:20.390
The last job,
water of very fast breath.

944
01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:25.400
Do about 15 with please.
This makes anal breasts.

945
01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:29.150
You will start to let go of anal tension,

946
01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:32.570
but if you're interested in high levels of wellbeing,

947
01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:37.930
I recommend 500 to 1,500 to a thousand

948
01:04:39.970 --> 01:04:43.630
<v 0>Maintel breath.
That's a lot of just time spent with your asshole.</v>

949
01:04:43.870 --> 01:04:46.990
Can I tell you the how the bad boy video angered you?

950
01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:49.500
This angers me and I hear

951
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:54.110
<v 10>more.
Oh,
thank you sir.
From this guy.
The other guy,</v>

952
01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:58.540
I don't recommend doing all thousand without a break.
This angers.

953
01:04:58.670 --> 01:05:02.030
You don't dress like a weight lifting at law,

954
01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:04.790
the mustache,

955
01:05:05.410 --> 01:05:08.310
<v 0>the mustache,
anal,
Brit</v>

956
01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:13.600
<v 10>massage.
Oh yeah.</v>

957
01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:18.100
When the sphincter muscles have been stretched and relaxed.
There's total

958
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:23.000
<v 0>satisfaction.
Nice,
nice totals.
That is bad.</v>

959
01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:26.260
Do you miss your four skin?
Do I miss it?

960
01:05:26.350 --> 01:05:28.540
Do you miss it like you know how there are men that like,

961
01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:33.070
I need your feet clean like for skin and then the force can move and then they

962
01:05:33.071 --> 01:05:34.900
pull it using pins and stuff.

963
01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:40.540
That's what I feel like this is like there's protesters now to circumcision.

964
01:05:40.541 --> 01:05:43.420
Yeah.
I know there's a whole movement and not a certain,
there's nice,

965
01:05:43.421 --> 01:05:45.040
I wish I had had a choice.

966
01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:53.350
No one gave me a choice.
It's true.
Top brutalized me at birth.

967
01:05:53.351 --> 01:05:55.000
Just like your gender assignment.

968
01:05:55.350 --> 01:05:58.300
Someone called you a boy and now you're stuck with that and someone gives you a

969
01:05:58.301 --> 01:06:01.930
circumcision duck with it.
I stuck with that.

970
01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:07.870
How dare they wish you guys hadn't done that to me.
Do you miss it though?

971
01:06:07.871 --> 01:06:11.790
Do you really?
Is that a thing for you?
Never think about it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

972
01:06:11.890 --> 01:06:15.850
Sometimes I pull on what's left of my botched circumcision.
It's not bosh fame.

973
01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:19.060
It looks great.
I'll put a picture online and you can tell me what you think,

974
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:22.330
but he's like reclaiming his asshole.

975
01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:27.780
He's saying that he was asked that he was robbed of his asshole pleasure and

976
01:06:29.231 --> 01:06:31.930
he's reclaiming that like it's important to him.

977
01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:36.580
[inaudible] see that angers me because I feel like his priorities are way out of

978
01:06:36.581 --> 01:06:37.990
whack.
Like you don't,

979
01:06:37.991 --> 01:06:42.991
you don't have a family to focus on or friends or dog to walk something in your

980
01:06:44.351 --> 01:06:48.910
life besides reclaiming your anal pleasure.
That makes me mad.

981
01:06:48.911 --> 01:06:52.060
When people are like this much of a loser,
like come on Bro.

982
01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:55.990
He really knows how to mix.
Focus on some shit that matters.
Okay.

983
01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:00.960
He really knows how to,
yeah.
Yeah.
Enjoy his asshole.

984
01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:06.210
People can't have access to fresh drinking water and there's starving children.

985
01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:08.800
That doesn't mean you should ignore your animals being abused.

986
01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:10.220
There's an ignore your ass,

987
01:07:10.221 --> 01:07:14.570
although million other causes so you could take out bro.
She goes,
Christ,

988
01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:18.160
by the way,
this is a real commercial commercial meeting.

989
01:07:18.161 --> 01:07:21.640
They filmed it and put it up a car company

990
01:07:24.110 --> 01:07:25.990
then not only hear it on TV but they,

991
01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.960
they put the phone number and everything and I think it's in Kansas City.

992
01:07:37.810 --> 01:07:38.643
<v 11>Right.</v>

993
01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.350
You fix it.
The bumper is hanging off of it

994
01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:50.973
don't matter.

995
01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:55.290
Just make sure you bring somebody down here,

996
01:07:55.310 --> 01:07:59.320
which you cause we all sell their shit as he is now.
We're driving,

997
01:07:59.650 --> 01:08:04.370
we test drive change all we do what we can make this shit happen.
Right.

998
01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:07.520
But three months down the line,
I don't want to hear about no alternators.

999
01:08:07.521 --> 01:08:10.820
You got a flat tire breaks.
Don't work.
Look fuck that.

1000
01:08:10.821 --> 01:08:12.600
We sell for transmission art.

1001
01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:15.810
As long as that moraine blowing up that transmission,

1002
01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:19.680
I don't bring that shit back.
Tripping.
All right.
Yup.

1003
01:08:19.790 --> 01:08:22.970
When you Baghdadi's bringing your grandpa and your grandma's bring any mother

1004
01:08:22.971 --> 01:08:23.431
fucker,

1005
01:08:23.431 --> 01:08:26.600
you want to bring the check these motherfuckers out cause we don't want to bring

1006
01:08:26.601 --> 01:08:28.290
this shit back and claim it down.
Nothing.

1007
01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:33.740
Gas Cards to send those same customers.
Okay.

1008
01:08:34.570 --> 01:08:38.730
<v 0>Um,
that's how door dash should be.
That's how I wished they were.</v>

1009
01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:43.640
We might get to shit on time.
We might not.
Yeah.
It's your problem.
Not My problem.

1010
01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:48.520
You get your food
now.
My job.
What does Kansas City here,

1011
01:08:48.521 --> 01:08:53.190

Not My job.
I really,
I really do appreciate that.

1012
01:08:53.191 --> 01:08:57.990
Directness id to always have.
Yeah.
It's a,
it's an honest car salesman.
There are.

1013
01:08:57.991 --> 01:09:01.740
There are none except for him here.
Fucking bullshit.

1014
01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:06.780
I don't want to hear that shit.
Don't come crying.
Imagine alternator.
Wait,

1015
01:09:06.781 --> 01:09:09.240
what was that again?
Don't come crying about your alternator.

1016
01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:13.860
It sounds like you're mocking somebody.
Not Mocking anybody.

1017
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:17.880
I was just doing a silly voice.
Tom.
I'm a voiceover artist.

1018
01:09:17.881 --> 01:09:22.530
I do several silly voices.
Would like to hear I do many voices.
Yes.

1019
01:09:22.531 --> 01:09:25.650
I would like to hear wait a little bit,
but there you go.
Wow.

1020
01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:28.230
Professional cartoon.
Voiceover artists.
Can you,

1021
01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:34.200

Wow.
That was really good.

1022
01:09:34.201 --> 01:09:38.790
Thank you.
Yours?
Wow.

1023
01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:43.770
Wow.
Really impressive.
Thank you.
Yeah.

1024
01:09:44.190 --> 01:09:45.023
Ready?
Yeah.

1025
01:09:49.610 --> 01:09:52.710
Are these all sound effects from the first song that you made?
No,

1026
01:09:52.711 --> 01:09:56.970
that was just from the apple computer,
but I can do them as well.
Nerd.

1027
01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:58.760
Yeah.
I'm not doing that one.

1028
01:09:58.770 --> 01:10:01.230
That's an actual character that I do in my repertoire.
So,

1029
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:06.390
so I'm not good with Stewart do it.
Oh,
why I'm doing the real voices.

1030
01:10:06.391 --> 01:10:09.190
No,
come on.
No,
no.

1031
01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:15.390
I have to pee.
Can I pee pee right now?
Be in your seat.
Okay,
go ahead.

1032
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:19.740
Uh,
How was your pee?
It was good.

1033
01:10:19.741 --> 01:10:23.060
And you know what I was thinking is that you might be the master of accents.

1034
01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:26.480
I'm the master of animals.
Yeah.
You,
yeah.

1035
01:10:26.481 --> 01:10:29.700
You send in the animal you want me to do and I'll do it.
Ah,

1036
01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:34.710
what a call Tom saying,
whoa.
You want to hear a zero work on it?

1037
01:10:34.711 --> 01:10:35.210
You know,

1038
01:10:35.210 --> 01:10:40.210
just what you through your apps really fucking intimidating coyotes.

1039
01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:45.360
Hedgehogs.
I'll work on it.
Oh,
by the way,
somebody said,
um,

1040
01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:50.100
my name is Jim.
In regards to a few weeks ago in the podcast,
a man claim,

1041
01:10:50.101 --> 01:10:54.480
there are no people in Benning billings,
Montana,
as fat as Tom Hubbard.

1042
01:10:54.510 --> 01:10:59.400
I have lived in billings my entire life and I promise there are people here even

1043
01:10:59.550 --> 01:11:03.840
fatter than fell Warburg.
Although with Bert it is clothes.
However,

1044
01:11:03.930 --> 01:11:07.500
there are no comedians here as fat as Barbie cause he's a fat fucking community.

1045
01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:12.150
Jesus.
Oh my God,
good luck guys.
James,
James,

1046
01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:14.010
Watergate theory.
Hey

1047
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:17.850
<v 4>Shit.
Schindler's,
um,
uh,</v>

1048
01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:20.310
after hours upon hours of research and film study.

1049
01:11:20.311 --> 01:11:25.170
The recent controversy of who the real h two o champ has come under question.

1050
01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:28.620
I myself am an equal opportunity mommy lover.

1051
01:11:28.890 --> 01:11:31.320
But it seems that the polls lately may have been skewed.

1052
01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:36.240
Buns declared himself water champ and I call bullshit Tom.

1053
01:11:36.990 --> 01:11:41.990
I was recently watching episode three 46 on youtube before any of the waters

1054
01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:42.590
can,

1055
01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:47.370
was brought to light and it's clear as day Tom sat through a whole episode

1056
01:11:47.371 --> 01:11:52.200
without so much as a sip of h two o none insight as a matter of fact,

1057
01:11:52.201 --> 01:11:57.060
well Mommy's see had a glass of brown interesting and a glass of water.
Okay.

1058
01:11:57.090 --> 01:11:59.670
Even though she was taking your keys.
Not Cool.

1059
01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:02.430
I know this isn't a significant piece of evidence,

1060
01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:06.240
but I thought I should bring it to the table.
See something.
Say something.

1061
01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:09.670
Yours truly Derek.
Thanks.

1062
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:13.280
<v 3>Thank you Derek.
I'm glad that finally,
you know,</v>

1063
01:12:13.281 --> 01:12:15.920
what's going to happen is that the truth will come out.
Eventually.

1064
01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:18.800
You're propaganda.
Uh,
you,
you know,

1065
01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:23.660
one time it had blue band bring you a gallon of water before the show and you

1066
01:12:23.661 --> 01:12:27.830
know this showboating nonsense.
Yes.
The truth is this is a marathon.

1067
01:12:28.190 --> 01:12:32.240
The water drinking champion and I will prevail.
You think so?
I am prevailing.

1068
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:36.710
I drink more water than you.
Okay.
Constantly.
I hydrate constantly.

1069
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:43.070
I feel like it's not even close,
but okay.
Time will tell.

1070
01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:48.440
Thank you for writing that in Derrick.
Thank you,
Derrick.
I shadowed,

1071
01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:51.030
<v 4>I sat her dance.</v>

1072
01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:54.193
<v 3>Here we go.</v>

1073
01:13:13.670 --> 01:13:17.600
<v 0>Floss them.
Shits,
settle,
updates.
Everybody.</v>

1074
01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:20.950
We got a few.
Oh good.
It's been a while.

1075
01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:25.850
People have been writing in about the dental updates.
Hi,
Mommy's three weeks ago,

1076
01:13:25.851 --> 01:13:27.020
Christina mentioned the crown.

1077
01:13:27.021 --> 01:13:30.380
It seemed a little bit wobbly and was concerned about popping it off.
Lawson,

1078
01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:35.510
I recently had a crown installed and this is what my dentist told me.

1079
01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:39.070
You can still floss,
but after you pushed him to dad,

1080
01:13:39.071 --> 01:13:41.060
he doesn't know that we've already covered this over this.

1081
01:13:41.410 --> 01:13:46.160
Remember I said I read this email?
Yeah.
And Oh,
it was on Patrion.
Okay.
Nevermind.

1082
01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:49.220
I read this email and I continue.
I'm sorry,

1083
01:13:49.221 --> 01:13:52.220
I didn't realize we didn't do it on a regular show.
Okay.
Uh,

1084
01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:54.890
you can do it in between.
You're still moving around.
Don't pull it.
All right.

1085
01:13:54.910 --> 01:13:56.210
That's great.
Back through.
All right,

1086
01:13:56.211 --> 01:13:59.270
so what he's saying is when you floss around a wobbly crown,

1087
01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:03.350
you just put the floss down on that,
run it through,
like you pull it out,

1088
01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:06.680
you don't pop it back up.
So I've been doing that.
It's really helped.
Thank you.

1089
01:14:06.710 --> 01:14:09.560
Okay,
well that we started doing that on this person's advice.

1090
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:12.120
Donika Donika Donika hop.

1091
01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:16.480
<v 4>By the way,
the Patriots show.
Ah,
the newest one is fucking fire.</v>

1092
01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:20.050

1098
01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:44.790
20 $20 people this month get a commemorative poster before August 1st then you

1099
01:14:47.561 --> 01:14:50.890
get that Cincinnati Farc poster.
Yeah.
Which isn't,
we have it online yet.

1100
01:14:50.891 --> 01:14:54.230
I don't think we have it.
Should we show it right now?
Sure.

1101
01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:56.690
I have it up on my Twitter account here.

1102
01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:01.210
I shadow jots.
Can you

1103
01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:07.210
look at that?
Look at that fucking thing.
More chairs made this rob.

1104
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:10.240
It's great.
Unbelievable man.
Yeah,
I love it.

1105
01:15:10.241 --> 01:15:14.590
It's like a Greasy mad magazine style.
I'll just,
I love this.
So much.

1106
01:15:14.591 --> 01:15:18.790
So cool.
Um,
all right.
More dental updates.
So I've done a lovely,

1107
01:15:18.791 --> 01:15:22.720
I haven't been to the dentist in two years because I don't like the dentist.

1108
01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:25.720
I love keeping my choppers clean,
but because I left college,

1109
01:15:26.170 --> 01:15:28.960
move cities looking for a job,
dental insurance to go with it.

1110
01:15:28.961 --> 01:15:31.240
Well now my new brand of dental insurance,

1111
01:15:31.630 --> 01:15:33.910
I found a dude dentist for a checkup and a cleaning.

1112
01:15:33.911 --> 01:15:37.060
I was already a little wary of a new place,
uh,

1113
01:15:37.090 --> 01:15:39.910
trying to pull one over on me and as I was filling out my paperwork,

1114
01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:43.210
a woman came in to complain about billing on her way out,

1115
01:15:43.211 --> 01:15:45.740
looked at me and whispered,
be careful.
Ah,

1116
01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:49.420
I had a good sign after doing x rays and a quick exam.

1117
01:15:49.450 --> 01:15:52.450
The dentist started telling me I had periodontitis.

1118
01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:56.650
That's gum disease is a,
how you say it,
period.
Done.

1119
01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:01.960
I think Santa's sounds like a dinosaur even though my teeth were work well

1120
01:16:02.651 --> 01:16:04.620
within the healthy depth measurements for gum.

1121
01:16:04.650 --> 01:16:08.770
She also told me that because the plaque build up on my teeth required the use

1122
01:16:08.771 --> 01:16:12.190
of dental tools,
it would constitute a deep cleaning.
Oh,
bullshit.

1123
01:16:12.250 --> 01:16:16.450
Which would cost me three 60 the deep cleaning dental tools is extra.

1124
01:16:16.451 --> 01:16:21.370
I got out of my chair and screamed,
do your job,
sweetie.
That's your job.

1125
01:16:22.570 --> 01:16:25.990
That's your job,
sweetie.
Sweetie.

1126
01:16:26.650 --> 01:16:30.250
She could tell you to tell me I had three cavities fixed immediately,

1127
01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.170
an extra hundred $80 each.

1128
01:16:32.171 --> 01:16:33.880
When I told her I wanted to go home and think about it,

1129
01:16:33.881 --> 01:16:37.660
they tried to pressure me into doing it right there.
Get your life even offering,

1130
01:16:37.661 --> 01:16:41.460
I could do a cleaning for half today.
That's a racket.

1131
01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:44.470
I'm not going to walk around with half of my face looking nasty like that.

1132
01:16:44.471 --> 01:16:48.280
You know what I'm saying?
Having listened to many a dental updates segment,

1133
01:16:48.281 --> 01:16:51.700
I knew this was a scam dentist.
Needless to say,
I got the hell out of there.

1134
01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:53.650
I'm looking for a second opinion.

1135
01:16:53.651 --> 01:16:57.780
I'm going to take Tina Jean's advice and look for an Eastern Block or dentist.

1136
01:16:57.781 --> 01:17:01.390
That's the real deal.
Not going to screw me over.
Keeping them high end tight,

1137
01:17:01.391 --> 01:17:04.150
Tori,
way to go,
Tori.
Um,

1138
01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:06.950
don't let those fuckers have the,

1139
01:17:06.970 --> 01:17:10.400
they'll drill into your head to make a few hundred bucks.

1140
01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.390
<v 0>Terrible.
We won't even need it.</v>

1141
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:14.840
And the fact that he said it's only been two years since his last visit,

1142
01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:17.300
you don't have periodontal disease,

1143
01:17:17.301 --> 01:17:21.350
I don't think in just two years of not seeing a dentist.
There's this thing too,

1144
01:17:21.710 --> 01:17:26.710
when you get dental insurance and you get an,
you know,
oh I see.
Yeah,

1145
01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:31.410
they rack it up.
They will wrap that shit up.
And Yeah,
if,

1146
01:17:31.470 --> 01:17:33.890
if you,
if you know,
if you had take care of your,

1147
01:17:34.190 --> 01:17:38.650
your dental hygiene pretty well,
like you're somebody who kind of,
you know,

1148
01:17:38.730 --> 01:17:43.670
flosses regularly brush your teeth and you go in and there's just this,

1149
01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:47.150
all these things they want to do.
I would always check it out somewhere else.

1150
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:51.890
Bullshit.
They tell you you got multiple cavities.

1151
01:17:51.891 --> 01:17:54.590
I would take it somewhere else too.
Absolutely.
Rays somewhere else.

1152
01:17:54.591 --> 01:17:56.750
Asked to have the x rays and take you check out.

1153
01:17:56.751 --> 01:18:00.470
This one I wanted to share my dental have today with you.
Um,

1154
01:18:00.530 --> 01:18:01.820
since you're a dental update.

1155
01:18:01.821 --> 01:18:06.350
Seg was inspired me to go to the dentist recently after over 15 buttery yellow

1156
01:18:06.351 --> 01:18:10.690
years of avoiding it,
15 years.
That's when you get the periodontal.

1157
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:16.110
While I brush my teeth every day and use mouthwash I have never ever philosophy

1158
01:18:16.131 --> 01:18:20.720
shits says by wisdom,
teeth are growing and I spent years in pain.

1159
01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:26.680
With each passing year my teeth hurt more and more I became convinced that they

1160
01:18:26.841 --> 01:18:29.630
were rotting and riddled with cavities.
Finally,
the pain was so intense,

1161
01:18:29.631 --> 01:18:31.490
I cracked,
went to the dentist.

1162
01:18:31.530 --> 01:18:34.850
Turns out I definitely need my wisdom teeth out.

1163
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:37.910
All four have grown in their crowded,

1164
01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:42.940
but what is amaze is they took a panoramic x rays and I have zero cavities.

1165
01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:44.720
Wow.
Dennis said,

1166
01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:48.920
I have perfect teeth sanctuary after you work up the courage to face my dental

1167
01:18:48.921 --> 01:18:53.900
fears.
Next step.
Whitening swiping pearly whites like my main money Tina.

1168
01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:59.450
And that's from Johnny.
Tom.
Thanks Jenny.
Good for you.
You know,

1169
01:18:59.930 --> 01:19:04.160
15 years.
There's nothing to be afraid of guys.
Yeah.
You know they numb you.

1170
01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:07.940
What's your afraid of is a shot maybe that that parts of the lung comfortable

1171
01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:11.420
and your wisdom teeth coming out.
That sucks.
I'm not gonna Lie Jenny,

1172
01:19:11.421 --> 01:19:15.770
but you get painkillers and it'll be right as rain and a couple of weeks she'll

1173
01:19:15.771 --> 01:19:18.020
be fine and then you can get back to your workouts.

1174
01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:21.330
<v 7>Keep moving and we're going to lunch to the side for one</v>

1175
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:26.990
one.
Squeeze your abs

1176
01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:43.840
<v 0>there.
We played as a baby.</v>

1177
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:47.650
It reminded me of how hard I laughed when that guy got hit by that car in the

1178
01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:51.550
garage.
Do you remember that?
I found that really troubling.

1179
01:19:54.370 --> 01:19:57.220
That wasn't so fun.
And look at you reliving it now

1180
01:20:11.230 --> 01:20:16.170
the mile and it's,
oh man.

1181
01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:20.220
I'm surprised that you shared that good time in your head just now.
He's lately.

1182
01:20:20.221 --> 01:20:23.700
You've been having fun thoughts and then you don't share them with me and you'll

1183
01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:27.990
like last night we were getting ready for bed and you were having so much fun

1184
01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:31.380
and you're having good fun thought at times and you were like laughing to

1185
01:20:31.381 --> 01:20:34.620
yourself and I was like,
well,
what?
What's the joke,
Tom?
Tell me.
Tell him.

1186
01:20:34.621 --> 01:20:38.540
Just tell me.
You're like,
no,
no,
I don't want to share with you.

1187
01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:42.930
And then you pull it off me and pushed.
Then don't make such a fun time about it.

1188
01:20:42.930 --> 01:20:43.980
Then keep it to yourself.

1189
01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:47.910
He can't just sit there laughing and smiling and then not share the joke.

1190
01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:54.090
Why can't I do that?
Because it's fucking rude.
We're comedians is rude.

1191
01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:59.010
You have to let me know what you're laughing at.
It's a professional courtesy,

1192
01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:03.930
man.
It wasn't even a good one.
All right.

1193
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:07.740
You made me tell you when I told you and it wasn't even good.
I liked it.

1194
01:21:07.741 --> 01:21:11.190
I liked the two shared.
You're like,
tell me,
tell me,

1195
01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:14.640
tell me what you're thinking right now.
What do you know?
No.
I said,

1196
01:21:14.641 --> 01:21:17.310
tell me what your,
what are you getting joy from right now?

1197
01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:21.660
Because I hate when you have joy and you don't share the joy.
It's not fair.

1198
01:21:22.290 --> 01:21:24.210
And I needed some joy.
I was tired.

1199
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:28.560
<v 14>Yeah.
Found that.
This is so funny.</v>

1200
01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:33.980
This is somewhere I don't think it's that.

1201
01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:41.220
I don't know.
Where is that
not American,

1202
01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:42.300
right?

1203
01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:47.300
So the car is rolling into this garage kind of slowly making its way in.

1204
01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:54.600
You can tell there's like a little bit of a speed bump or something and then

1205
01:21:54.601 --> 01:21:58.830
it's like going on to the,
uh,
the guys back there on his clipboard.

1206
01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:00.990
It's like backing up and could tell the guys,

1207
01:22:09.810 --> 01:22:12.060
see blue band doesn't think that's fucked up,
man.

1208
01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:23.500
<v 2>Sorry,
I'm missing the funny.</v>

1209
01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:27.210
This man just finally got his legs broken.

1210
01:22:34.930 --> 01:22:39.040
<v 14>He's in pain,
Babe.
It's not funny.
His legs are broken.</v>

1211
01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:42.540
You can't stand.
He's collapsing because his legs are broken.

1212
01:22:44.690 --> 01:22:47.250
<v 2>Oh,
this is the most,</v>

1213
01:22:56.550 --> 01:23:00.100
<v 14>what's up?
Like he's a screaming.</v>

1214
01:23:00.101 --> 01:23:04.720
You can't see his concern at his concern now.
It's terrible.

1215
01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:07.630
You dropped some back there.
They just walks away.

1216
01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:12.340
A shitty friend.
Ooh,
wow.

1217
01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:15.670
He's still on the floor and he's writhing in pain.

1218
01:23:18.510 --> 01:23:23.260
He
looks like he dropped like a,

1219
01:23:23.290 --> 01:23:26.710
like a,
like a business card or over here he'd say for,
where did I put

1220
01:23:29.610 --> 01:23:32.650
like I can't get up baby.
He's all right.
He's not all right.

1221
01:23:32.651 --> 01:23:35.470
He's not popped up yet.
He comes up Bert later.

1222
01:23:35.530 --> 01:23:38.590
He's not look at the title of the thing.
It's not even funny.

1223
01:23:38.591 --> 01:23:43.150
It doesn't say funny anywhere.
I don't know why you're laughing,
man.

1224
01:23:43.151 --> 01:23:45.640
Gets crushed by car.
Can't get up.

1225
01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:50.200
<v 0>That was paralyzed from the waist down and you're dying of laughter.
Oh Man.</v>

1226
01:23:51.070 --> 01:23:52.960
This is why I do think you're a serial killer.

1227
01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:56.150
It's moments like this around the news reported the guy's fine.

1228
01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:59.830
It's what it says here.
It does.
You're gonna murder me in my sleep.

1229
01:24:03.530 --> 01:24:06.960
<v 1>Blue bands not laughing.
He's laughing.
He's laughing at you.
Right?</v>

1230
01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:11.820
How you're laughing so hard at this cruise.
Why?
Because it's not normal.

1231
01:24:12.170 --> 01:24:14.760
It's not funny.
No,
not at all.
No.
Is it?

1232
01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:19.410
It's a guy getting run over by a car and you find it the whole area.

1233
01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:25.720
<v 0>Well it's,
he goes,
AH,
right.</v>

1234
01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:27.250
Cause he's in pain and he's a foreigner.

1235
01:24:27.251 --> 01:24:32.230
He does it make the same sounds in American would.
And again,
okay,
this,

1236
01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:36.040
oh my God,
you're such a psycho.
You need to tell your therapist about this.

1237
01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:39.940
Will you please,
please bring this up in therapy.
He goes,

1238
01:24:39.941 --> 01:24:44.080
I lost it at the part where he backs up and the dude falls on the floor.
Lol.

1239
01:24:44.170 --> 01:24:49.050
That's a comment underneath here.
Um,
it's a,
you know,

1240
01:24:49.051 --> 01:24:53.520
it's a bad liar.
People were at,
wow,
man,
I hope the car isn't hurting.

1241
01:24:55.370 --> 01:24:56.203
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1242
01:24:56.430 --> 01:24:59.910
<v 0>Now don't,
don't try to look for evidence to support your mental illness.</v>

1243
01:24:59.911 --> 01:25:02.880
You have problems or why do I have a problem?
Because it's not,

1244
01:25:02.881 --> 01:25:04.860
it's not supposed to be funny.
I don't think.

1245
01:25:04.861 --> 01:25:08.640
It's funny that a guy got hit by a car,
but I think his reaction was funny.

1246
01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:13.250
Kilos two are kind of inseparable.
Like it's big.

1247
01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:15.780
He's reacting because he's in pain.

1248
01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:20.780
<v 1>Ah.
Ah,
okay.</v>

1249
01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:24.950
<v 0>Okay.
You're laughing like an 80 year old reactions.</v>

1250
01:25:25.010 --> 01:25:27.020
Reactions are funny in those situations.

1251
01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:31.580
Like when the guy kills that hooker in that a heading out and go,
I can't,

1252
01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:32.960
are we done here?
Is this done?

1253
01:25:33.050 --> 01:25:36.290
<v 1>No.
What's your problem?</v>

1254
01:25:37.850 --> 01:25:38.750
What is your problem?

1255
01:25:39.850 --> 01:25:43.660
<v 0>That was funny.
I haven't laughed that hard since the first time I saw a video.</v>

1256
01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:48.160
Ah,
hi.

1257
01:25:48.530 --> 01:25:49.363
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1258
01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:53.680
<v 0>Ooh.
I feel like getting some fucking leather bracelets today.
I feel so.</v>

1259
01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:55.030
Oh my God.
You shove your bed,

1260
01:25:55.190 --> 01:25:56.023
<v 1>boy.</v>

1261
01:25:57.250 --> 01:25:58.550
<v 0>What is this?
I don't know what this is.
Even,</v>

1262
01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:04.280
um,
the water champion

1263
01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:08.900
<v 3>has showed Bruce that.
Excellent.
How should I wait?
Who made that?</v>

1264
01:26:09.130 --> 01:26:13.640
Did you make that blue band?
I did not make that.
I think Patty,
you see me okay.

1265
01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:18.860
That she made me part of a AH,
wow.
Yeah.
Part of a movement.

1266
01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:22.490
And you think are the water champion and this is for

1267
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:28.370
<v 13>okay.
Packet.</v>

1268
01:26:36.110 --> 01:26:36.943
Not good

1269
01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:49.330
raised.
I love it.

1270
01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:52.533
Great.

1271
01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:00.190
<v 3>Great.
That's great.
That is great.</v>

1272
01:27:00.191 --> 01:27:05.191
It was that the streets by Brandy Roz Ryan and Jennifer Lewis.

1273
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:09.970
Really?
Brandy,
brandy,
brandy.
Yeah,

1274
01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:16.590
that's fine.
It sure is.
Look at that face.
It's brandy.
Oh my God.

1275
01:27:16.591 --> 01:27:20.420
That is not brandy.
Brandy.
No one's branding though.

1276
01:27:20.421 --> 01:27:24.750
It's not if you've never seen Andy is mass.

1277
01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:31.950
No.
Johar Nair,
Nair.

1278
01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:38.960
No.
What's that?
Oh my God.
Anything else?
Jeans?
No,
no,

1279
01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:44.420
you have nothing else people wrote in and let,
and let me know that.

1280
01:27:44.421 --> 01:27:47.750
You know how a while back I was talking about Gardetto's and how they should

1281
01:27:47.751 --> 01:27:52.460
only have the tasty chips.
The Rye chips in there.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1282
01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:55.880
There is a product that you can just buy the good pieces.
Oh Wow.

1283
01:27:55.940 --> 01:28:00.320
Thanks for letting me know.
That's a huge update.
People can get just the chips.

1284
01:28:00.321 --> 01:28:05.120
They like it.
That's what I'm talking about.
It's important to me guys.
Okay,

1285
01:28:06.710 --> 01:28:11.210
good to know that.
Uh,
anything else here?
Let's see.

1286
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:15.260
I do think this was so great.
We should play this again.

1287
01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:21.180
The same fat Harbert Cordova Love Sugar,

1288
01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:25.220
but Christ crusher,
you are a fat can't,

1289
01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:26.950
you're a fat.
That constant.

1290
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.620
Thomson [inaudible] 11 international international ones.

1291
01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:37.080
Really good.
Good job on that stuff.
Oh,
I was going to mention the other day,

1292
01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:39.500
you and I were play hitting each other.
Yeah.

1293
01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:44.200
And you do this thing where like if I punch you or hit you,
yeah.

1294
01:28:44.250 --> 01:28:46.680
Then you get me back twice.
That makes you feel good.

1295
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.070
You get me back double for the pantry.
The hit.
Yeah.

1296
01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:53.640
But you did this thing the other day where you pinched me,

1297
01:28:53.641 --> 01:28:56.760
you hit my arm and then you're like,
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

1298
01:28:56.761 --> 01:29:00.510
And then you went to rub it,
but then the rubbing made it hurt more.

1299
01:29:00.570 --> 01:29:02.220
Well that's what you said,
but that doesn't

1300
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:06.870
<v 0>make sense.
So what happened was I pinched you to get you back and you're like,</v>

1301
01:29:06.930 --> 01:29:09.180
oh,
that really hurt.
And then I went to rub it.

1302
01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:12.900
And you're like to have rubbing hurts,
hurt more.

1303
01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:16.250
Go Away.
No rubbing.
It felt better.

1304
01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:22.860
Rubbing always makes the the ouch part.
The alley place hurt more.
No,

1305
01:29:22.890 --> 01:29:26.640
everyone knows that.
No one knows that rubbing makes it feel better.
No,

1306
01:29:26.730 --> 01:29:30.600
that hurts me.
Rub It for no dumb,
dumb kissing.
It makes it better rubbing.

1307
01:29:30.601 --> 01:29:32.190
It hurts more.
No,

1308
01:29:33.550 --> 01:29:37.890
you're very malicious with the play fighting.
If I pinch you,

1309
01:29:37.891 --> 01:29:41.670
then you get me back sometimes two or three times while to get you back with the

1310
01:29:41.671 --> 01:29:44.910
pinches and stuff.
I like to mention twist too.

1311
01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:50.280
Like I'll grab real soft parts mean and I squeeze it as hard as I can.

1312
01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:54.690
But you do it double or triple the amount that I gave you and that's not fair.

1313
01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:57.330
Well that's how to make sure you get somebody back.

1314
01:29:57.331 --> 01:29:58.640
I mean that's the whole thing is I'm trying.

1315
01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:00.370
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1316
01:30:00.370 --> 01:30:03.980
<v 0>Um,
is this Kevin Gates thing set up or is it just the youtube link</v>

1317
01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:10.870
<v 1>that's red.
It was just planet.
Don't play it.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.</v>

1318
01:30:11.310 --> 01:30:11.530
Okay.

1319
01:30:11.530 --> 01:30:14.670
<v 0>Um,
[inaudible] nobody wants to hear.</v>

1320
01:30:15.150 --> 01:30:17.470
Oh God.

1321
01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:21.490
You want to hear a song gene

1322

This looks ridiculous.
It was good.
Yeah,

1324
01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:32.210
Probably.
Okay.

1325
01:30:37.010 --> 01:30:37.843

1329
01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:05.180
They'll make our navy shun the greatest.
It's been

1330
01:31:08.770 --> 01:31:12.560
great.
I really feel like we've seen this acid tremor.

1331
01:31:12.561 --> 01:31:17.470

01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:36.913
