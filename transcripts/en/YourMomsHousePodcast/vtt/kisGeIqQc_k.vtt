00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.550

<v 0>three</v>

5
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.080
<v 1>or you're probably turned down.
Did you do that on purpose?</v>

6
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.710
A purpose.

7
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.530
<v 0>So it's very exciting.
Uh,
if you don't know what we're doing,</v>

8
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.550
what do you mean?
You're pointing at me like I would do it.

9
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.620
That's your fault.
Just turn your headphones up now they are up.
Okay,
there,

10
00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:59.590
there,
there,
there.

11
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.010
We're doing the podcast live brass balls,
beach,

12
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:07.740
Florida at the West Palm Improv

13
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.570
August 23rd.
It's going to be awesome.
It is getting full.
Just so people know.

14
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.030
We will be meeting everyone after the show.
People have asked us that.

15
00:01:20.031 --> 00:01:23.400
He didn't say anything about that.
Well,
I will be personality champ.

16
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:24.870
Actually say probably shit.
No Way.

17
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:27.960
You can really make a determination for yourself.
If you're at that show

18
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.100
personality champ.
Um,
make sure you,
uh,
you get your tickets.

19
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.260
Also the Irvine Improv.

20
00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:40.950
We're doing your mom's house live October 8th.

21
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.120
It's going to go down.
Don't sweat it.
This is the one we rescheduled.

22
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.930
If you did have tickets to the last one,
they did not transfer.

23
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.250
That's something we just found out.
Um,

24
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.080
and the reason that they didn't transfer is because they're dumb,

25
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.190
but wow,
why wouldn't you do that?

26
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.080
So it's pretty sensible and refunded people.

27
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.180
You just have to rebate and that's what they're doing.
So,
October 8th,

28
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.690
Irvine Improv your mom's house live.
Um,

29
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.530
I am shooting a special September 16th in Denver.
Uh,

30
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.770
the first show is sold out.
The second show has about 150 tickets left.

31
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.940
So if you want to go,
this is probably the last week there'll be available,

32
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.600
a couple of shows that have been added.
Just so you know,

33
00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:31.950
I'm doing the Brayer Improv for one night,
September 13th.

34
00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:34.560
So that's two nights or three nights before I shoot this special.

35
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.020
I'm doing the Fox theater in Oakland,
uh,
two nights before the special.
And,
uh,

36
00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:44.220
the week before I'm in Nebraska,
Midwest city and Springfield,

37
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.410
Missouri,
all leading up to the special.
After that,

38
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.790
the,
uh,
my tour continues.
If you go to Tom [inaudible] dot com slash tour,

39
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.500
you can see all the dates there.
Toronto,
Anarbor,
Indianapolis.

40
00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:00.040
It just goes on and on.
Of course,

41
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.840
<v 2>New York City is now on sale,
g Dork titties.
Um,</v>

42
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.120
I always feel it necessary to explain to the Toronto people that because of the

43
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:11.380
way that the,
uh,
festival set up the links,

44
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.040
when you go to my page,
if you go to violet,

45
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.640
Toronto tickets and you hit like fine tickets,
it,

46
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.390
it finds you a festival pass,

47
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.770
<v 3>you actually have to scroll down and go headliner ticket and that's the</v>

48
00:03:22.771 --> 00:03:26.370
individual tickets to my show.
It's just really annoying.
So,
uh,

49
00:03:26.371 --> 00:03:30.720
I've had to explain people on Instagram and on Twitter,
you know,

50
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.670
<v 2>a hundred times how to do that.
It's just a,</v>

51
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.680
something they didn't really think through.
Uh,
this song,
by the way,

52
00:03:37.681 --> 00:03:42.681
is easy produced by Chris Rhythm about that prism for them.

53
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.910
Yeah.
You said Nebraska unthinking nerd Brasco yeah.

54
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.000
Yeah.
I don't know.
There's a better one out there,

55
00:03:51.001 --> 00:03:54.510
but nerd breasts and their breasts.

56
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.430
Dude,
that was horrible.
You have no idea what you just did to people.

57
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.190
That was horrible.
Why would you do that into them?

58
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.980
That was horrible because I've never done it before.

59
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.910
Almost wanting to try it completely.
Blew it out,
Sam.

60
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.820
Sorry God,
I just wanted to see what that felt like.
Alright.

61
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.480
I've never off.

62
00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.180
Why

63
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.250
did you do that to me?
I've never sneezed on this show.

64
00:04:26.251 --> 00:04:29.780
1 million people.
Just ask that question.

94
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.920
It's very easy to do.
All you do is go to your mom's house,

95
00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:37.970
podcast.com and you do the shopping you would normally do on Amazon.

96
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.480
After you click our banner,
it gives a little kickback to the show.

97
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.750
We also have a UK version and we have a Canadian version and Canadia and

Canadia.

You can shop through our amazon.ca banner and it supports the show.

100
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:58.330
Canada's not la,

103

Proud winds are native and I was wearing a Canadian Tuxedo on that show.

104
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.460
That was really fun.
That was a lot of fun.
It's always fun to do.
Canadia.

105
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.280
I actually am most looking forward if I could be honest.

106
00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:19.550
I'm really looking forward to shooting this special and you just spilled on your

107
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:23.030
big tits and I'm looking forward to shooting this special obviously in Denver,

108
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.590
but for the rest of the year,

109
00:07:24.591 --> 00:07:29.330
I think I'm most looking forward to my Toronto date.
Yeah.
t.is an amazing city.

110
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.970
I really called it that.
I coined that phrase data and now they call it,

111
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.500
it's embarrassing.
All right,
here we go.
Let's start the show.

112
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.330
All the places on your calendars are places you want to go to.

113
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.190
I liked doing my tour.
I'm saying a most,
I love the city of Toronto.

114
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.570
It's going to be exciting for me and my cousin Bree,
Bree might come.

115
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.010
Oh you're kidding.
Yeah.
Is,

116
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.240
is there food in Toronto?
Oh my God.
He's going to ask me so many things.

117
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.980
Are you,
do you know what time you're checking in and then do you know,

118
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:08.150
um,
what,
uh,
are you going to go downstairs now?

119
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.980
What time is it?
Should I go with,
is there,

120
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.030
can I stand back and get out of his seat?
Can I,

121
00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.660
can I also do it and then after,
do you want me to be there?

122
00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:19.460
And then how are you getting to the airport,

123
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.330
which was gate where you think you're going to get something to drink before
you,

124
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:28.040
do you think the foods too spicy in Toronto or will they have items on the menu

125
00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:28.910
that don't have spice?

126
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:32.180
I have to wash your hands after cause I don't want to get spice in my cat's eyes

127
00:08:32.181 --> 00:08:36.350
when I pet my can I have the enzymes to break down all that spice.
That's true.

128
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.550
You know my parents were the opposite of your parents.

129
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.730
Like where's your parents explain things to you and they were like,

130
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:48.310
they take the time and my family there was a do not ask questions.
Policy.
Yeah.

131
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.240
It was always like don't ask,
just don't ask.

132
00:08:50.241 --> 00:08:54.710
So I learned to be very self reliant that way.
I don't ask questions anymore.

133
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.190
All right.
Here we go.

134
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.370
<v 4>Dig a big stinky shit after I go.</v>

135
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:07.340
I don't use Twitter for I flushed the toilet.
I did my hand as getting here.
Yeah.

136
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:12.450
Three,
three roughly.
And then flush again.
We'll dip.
One,
two,
three,
four,
five.

137
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.260
<v 1>Don't
bring it</v>

138
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.580
to your mom's house.
Shoot.

139
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.790
Christina pushes.
It seems

140
00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:35.643
so rude,

141
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.110
dude.
A white guy.

142
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.483
We were.

143
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:13.170
<v 0>Thanks Trevor.
When they came out a ball Sacramento this weekend,</v>

144
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.740
the full charge was with me.
Oh always.
Fantastic.
Always fantastic.

145
00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:21.690
We were hanging out and randomly we heard two guns and roses songs just like in

146
00:10:21.691 --> 00:10:23.760
restaurants and stuff.
And we were talking about like,

147
00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:28.761
can you imagine what it was like in their heyday to be slash on stage during one

148
00:10:30.811 --> 00:10:35.811
of those solos and your face is melting off from the drugs you did backstage and

149
00:10:35.821 --> 00:10:36.654
you're just like,

150
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.930
you don't even have to think to play your solo and it's a stadium.

151
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.200
It's like 80,000 people she was going like,

152
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.220
and you're so fucking high,
you know,

153
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.470
and the energy and like it's so crazy they probably to tell you when,

154
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.400
when the show is over there like,
hey man,
it's over now.
He's like,
what?

155
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:58.690
He was saying,
uh,
uh,
full charge said he read slashes book.
Yeah.

156
00:10:58.770 --> 00:10:59.910
And that,
you know,

157
00:10:59.911 --> 00:11:04.160
they used to get so fucked up just drinking the handles of Jack and doing heroin

158
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:05.460
and I'm laying on that.

159
00:11:05.461 --> 00:11:10.200
He a one time he called somebody in a hotel and he was like,
where are we?

160
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:15.630
And they go,
where are we?
We're in Tokyo.
He goes,
shut the fuck up.

161
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:19.470
And they go look out the window.
He looked out the window,
he was like,

162
00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:22.020
Oh shit it is Tokyo.
He had no idea where he was.

163
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:26.210
O m g O M G for real plan.
Those hot licks?
Yeah.

164
00:11:26.211 --> 00:11:30.520
Not on the road.
Is that what they call those hot licks or they get to ours.

165
00:11:30.521 --> 00:11:31.690
The hot legs

166
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.540
think such a dad where I know,

167
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:41.640
could you imagine also the rate at which those guys were probably getting laid

168
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:46.410
to?
No know their outcome.
There's no car,
there's no way.
There's no kind of way.

169
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.110
And even that guy slash I wasn't a huge,

170
00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.120
I was just not a huge fan of those dudes.

171
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.260
I was listening to bow house and you know,
whatever.
But yeah,

172
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.720
his face was totally covered with hair right here on the,

173
00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:02.260
I like on the bridge of your nose and the hair cover,

174
00:12:02.261 --> 00:12:05.710
the face and the cigarette.
It was just hanging out of his mouth.

175
00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:09.550
I mean he just looked fucked up constantly.
I don't know if he was,

176
00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:14.110
but he definitely looked that way,
but he could shred right talent.

177
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:17.290
I just remember I was telling him,
I remember that,

178
00:12:17.291 --> 00:12:21.610
you know people would always talk about guitar players and I'm not a guitar

179
00:12:21.611 --> 00:12:22.270
player,

180
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:26.890
but I would always hear the conversations about the greatest and it would always

181
00:12:26.891 --> 00:12:30.910
be people would talk about BB king,
Eric Clapton,
always people and Hendrix.

182
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:35.530
But I remember when when at least when I was listening to those songs at first I

183
00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:38.010
would be like,
is this not a bad motherfucker?

184
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:42.040
Because it sure sounds like it to me the way that those solos and spellings

185
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:46.040
outlets were shred apart man.
I mean he really did.

186
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:51.010
He destroyed on this amazing look.
Nobody,

187
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:55.930
very few people didn't like that bat.
I was gone.
I was like hardcore God than,

188
00:12:55.990 --> 00:13:00.310
and I knew all their songs because they had played them in grocery stories and

189
00:13:00.311 --> 00:13:02.730
shit and they definitely still hold up for sure.

190
00:13:02.731 --> 00:13:06.520
Shoe songs are like you could put it on,
it's,
it's,
it's a solid,

191
00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:12.310
did you have a GNR shirt?
No,
I wasn't.
I wasn't a GNR shirt guy,

192
00:13:12.311 --> 00:13:13.210
but I definitely had those.

193
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.600
I had the tape cause that's still like one of the best.

194
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.120
I remember for a football it was,

195
00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.560
it was one of the pregame tapes.
They play on the overhead system.

196
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:27.520
Welcome to the jungle and and and also in the weight room.

197
00:13:27.521 --> 00:13:30.850
So like whenever we had,
I mean that came on.
It still comes on and you're like,

198
00:13:30.851 --> 00:13:34.720
fuck it.
Let's do this.
Crack some fucking skulls.

199
00:13:34.721 --> 00:13:36.640
When you hear that music definitely welcome

200
00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.420
<v 5>jungle.
Yeah.</v>

201
00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.270
Wow.
I don't

202
00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:47.930
<v 0>think I've ever heard you do that voice and I never want to hear it again.</v>

203
00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:52.180
Was it as good as my sneeze earlier or worse?
Like what was more,

204
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.570
the snooze was terrible.
His nuts.
Another person.
Axl Rose's voices also.

205
00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:01.660
So crazy.
Crazy maze.
I do think he still can sing like that.
He's old.
No,

206
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.560
I don't think he could sing just like that,

207
00:14:03.561 --> 00:14:06.110
but I think it's probably pretty good because that there is,

208
00:14:06.111 --> 00:14:09.350
there is such thing as after a certain point.

209
00:14:09.351 --> 00:14:14.250
There's certain voices that just you can't carry,
can't hit the notes she used,

210
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.833
Whitney couldn't,

211
00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:19.520
I don't think Aretha Franklin can hit the notes she hit in the seventies like

212
00:14:19.521 --> 00:14:22.700
it's just like
you age.

213
00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.270
I liked Perry for ELLs voice a lot from James and he's got a great voice.

214
00:14:26.271 --> 00:14:30.890
He's another one that I don't think it sounds like anybody else.
It's amazing.

215
00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:33.530
It's super unique.
It's true.
Yeah.
It's a weird one.

216
00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.120
But axles was like so famous and nobody,
if somebody else,

217
00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:42.100
there's songs where another singer can sing the song.
You're like yeah that's,

218
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:45.950
that's that song.
But if someone else sings guns [inaudible] roses songs,

219
00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.730
it doesn't sound like no that,
that's a special unique thing.

220
00:14:49.731 --> 00:14:52.040
A group of people in the space and,
and place and

221
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.050
<v 2>everything can't replicate now car cause I grew up even when I was,</v>

222
00:14:55.051 --> 00:14:58.130
I grew up in La and I remember when that ban hit GNR cause they were like a

223
00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:02.060
sunset strip bad.
It was fucking pandemonium.
Dude's like,

224
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:06.110
cause I used to go to the Roxy.
My stepmom liked of all things hash and music,

225
00:15:06.111 --> 00:15:09.380
like heavy metal,
heavy metal is huge.
When those guys came out.

226
00:15:09.381 --> 00:15:13.310
So we would go down to the Roxy and see bands play and that they were just the

227
00:15:13.311 --> 00:15:15.920
biggest thing,
man.
Those guys,
you couldn't escape them.

228
00:15:15.921 --> 00:15:19.100
Did you see them play in a small venue?
I don't think so.
No.
No,

229
00:15:19.101 --> 00:15:23.390
but I remember pirate radio was this thing in La was like Hessian radio station

230
00:15:23.391 --> 00:15:25.880
and they played them and it was a big scene here.

231
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.850
It must have been so crazy to be like,
oh yeah,
I saw guns and roses.

232
00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:35.540
It fucking,
yeah,
on sunset.
And then the next year,
where do you see them?
Oh,

233
00:15:35.541 --> 00:15:38.360
there are dodger stadium right now.
Yeah,
my,
well,

234
00:15:38.361 --> 00:15:41.210
our friend Alan who does our hair,
he's like,
yeah,
so if we can,

235
00:15:41.211 --> 00:15:44.180
Jane's addiction on sunset.
And I saw clicking GNR he saw,

236
00:15:44.181 --> 00:15:48.830
he's a little bit older than us,
so he saw that stuff
all for sure.

237
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:54.230
He's all fucking saw the pixies like in 1986 he looks good for his age,

238
00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:57.080
doesn't he?
I start to pay attention to that so much more now.

239
00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:02.530
I saw something like some guy died and it was on his bio in the said 53 I'm

240
00:16:02.601 --> 00:16:06.030
like,
it's good.
It does do,
it looks 80 yeah.
There's people who just,
you know,

241
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.640
look,
you're lucky because your pops.
He looks great.
He looks fantastic.

242
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.600
71 looks great.

243
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.880
My mother actually aged very well til we'll see what happens here.

244
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:21.650
But none of that shit.
They both looked okay.
You're set up for success.

245
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.210
Now this actually means it's all on you

246
00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:29.120
stay off the heroin.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now you see it all the time.

247
00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:34.121
I mean I'm talking to people and then a Rogan just turned 50 I think he looks

248
00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:37.850
amazing.
Looks Great.
Really takes care of himself though.
Right?

249
00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:42.851
So that is the key is an age where you can look 40 or you can look 90 50 is like

250
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.530
a really,
you follow one side or the other?
Oh yeah.

251
00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.020
Well 40 is when you hit a wall.
That's,

252
00:16:51.021 --> 00:16:54.470
that's when you either you go hard on maintenance.
No,

253
00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:57.770
I'm in my thirties I'm like thinking about what it would be like,
shut up.

254
00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.450
I just don't know.
Hate you so much.

255
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:02.930
How much more until your forties I don't know.
I can't add that high.

256
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:08.270
It's still a while though.
What's going to happen?
What's it like up there?

257
00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:12.740
Actually I was already thinking that how next year I still won't turn 40 what

258
00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:14.030
would that be like?
I don't know.

259
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.470
I like bringing my four I like 41 it's awesome.

260
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.440
It's fucking great because you don't give a fuck.

261
00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.710
I didn't give a fuck in my thirties now I give even less fucks in my forties

262
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:28.640
fucking don't care.
I do like that process of of living and aging.

263
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:32.810
People don't realize it really happens where as the years go by,

264
00:17:32.811 --> 00:17:35.930
you really are like,
I don't give a fuck.
Every year it's a little more,

265
00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.090
you don't care about something.
It's not that you don't care about everything,

266
00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:43.180
that you care about certain things and then the rest just disappeared.

267
00:17:43.181 --> 00:17:48.140
Realize how insignificant and not important things are.
Yeah,
exactly.

268
00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:50.040
It's just like we know when you're in middle school you

269
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.920
<v 0>care so much about,
oh my God,
where did that person think?</v>

270
00:17:52.921 --> 00:17:56.670
If I wear these brown shoes and you think it's so important and you,

271
00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.120
you make sure that like you,

272
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.440
you don't have those shoes on you like you think that that's someone else's

273
00:18:01.441 --> 00:18:04.850
focus.
You know,
and then,
I don't know,
2030 years later you're like,
I can go,

274
00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:10.040
you know of shit into like something to be carrying.

275
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:14.610
What I wore and not to be a shameless plug or right now,
but on that steep bro.

276
00:18:14.611 --> 00:18:19.140
That is a lot of what I talk about on that show about life and the nature of it

277
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:22.110
and get and part of getting your life too is like you,

278
00:18:22.111 --> 00:18:25.120
you learn to focus your fox.
Really.
It's like that book man.

279
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:30.000
Subtle art of not giving a fuck.
It was funny cause I,

280
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:31.290
I bought this book,

281
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:35.790
I've been reading it and then I go you're going to love this and then you're

282
00:18:35.791 --> 00:18:38.730
like,
oh my God,
oh blah blah blah blah.

283
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:44.880
I'll talk about all the time.
I love your voice.
I love the,

284
00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:49.500
you're a girl talk voice.
Cause I hear you speak on how I talk.

285
00:18:49.501 --> 00:18:52.900
That's how your sisters taught.
No it's no,
that's exactly why you talk

286
00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:59.070
about your boyfriend here.
Take a big stinky shit.

287
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:02.820
Flush the toilet.

288
00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.990
<v 4>Let's get in here.
Yeah.</v>

289
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:19.340
<v 0>Do you want to describe his,
uh,
his gear is attire.</v>

290
00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.920
Uh,
let's say he's on the non binary spectrum.
Yeah.

291
00:19:23.921 --> 00:19:28.921
I mean the shirt is torn open so that half of his chest is written as a torn

292
00:19:29.801 --> 00:19:30.520
shirt.

293
00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:34.970
And it says sexy Vegan and then Vegan on the arm.

294
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:40.270
He's vegans either tattooed or it's written in humongous permanent marker.

295
00:19:40.271 --> 00:19:42.280
And then it's over the eye.
Oh,

296
00:19:42.281 --> 00:19:46.090
and the other four on his eyebrow and he's got like those,

297
00:19:46.091 --> 00:19:50.890
what are those gauges or something and his ears and um,
yeah,

298
00:19:50.891 --> 00:19:54.520
it looks Bluetooth or it looks lean.

299
00:19:55.480 --> 00:20:00.280
He's definitely definitely eats right now we know so he doesn't use paper,

300
00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:02.500
but I thought this was interesting.
Listening to hiss.

301
00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:04.580
<v 4>I flush,</v>

302
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:15.690
flush
tip,

303
00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:20.290
get this six times and then sometimes do more around here.

304
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.060
<v 0>First of all,
I want to point out that you know,</v>

305
00:20:24.061 --> 00:20:26.160
he's big on obviously not using the paper.

306
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:29.790
He's already flushed three or four times.
So He's wasting water.

307
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.780
So he's trading paper waste for waterway.
Yeah,

308
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.633
I mean,

309
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.360
<v 4>yeah,
we'll see.
That's gross.</v>

310
00:20:37.361 --> 00:20:42.310
But the fact remains set for library science and smells.

311
00:20:42.311 --> 00:20:43.950
There's no one putting smell and everyone else's,

312
00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:48.030
but you could smell from like at least a foot away.
You go like or

313
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.400
<v 2>honor and then you could smell a mining camp.
My smells delicious.
Wait a minute,</v>

314
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:53.500
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

315
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.510
Did you just see what I saw and eyebrows what?
There are no eyebrows.

316
00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.570
They're shaved and pencil.
Their PR,

317
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:04.000
their it in like that crazy guy that used to live in the rampart division at the

318
00:21:04.001 --> 00:21:07.330
bus stop.
Are you suggesting that this guy's not mentally fit?

319
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:14.340
What's going on with these Vegan do fee convit shine.

320
00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.230
So they love to identify vegans can't shut the fuck up about it.

321
00:21:18.231 --> 00:21:19.940
That's the anomaly.
That's one lane of it.

322
00:21:19.941 --> 00:21:24.500
But this is also like a little crazy and it's become an identity.

323
00:21:24.501 --> 00:21:28.970
Like when the Diet becomes an identity and the look,
I get it.
It's a candid,

324
00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:33.470
I'm licking your balls are your penis or anus or something?
Go ahead.

325
00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.360
Go ahead.

326
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.360
You can pretend you can pretend that permission Telford fucking hate that guy.

327
00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:41.750
No,
I don't hate,
I don't want to put out there that I,
I,
I do not hate vegans.

328
00:21:41.751 --> 00:21:42.230
I don't,

329
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:46.190
I just think when you identify with any diet so much you have to advertise it.

330
00:21:46.191 --> 00:21:48.800
It's a little weird.
Steve's really into it.

331
00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:53.510
He goes deep and it's caught hold with his bare hand.
Hold on,
jumped over that.

332
00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:57.280
We got our weddings ass with his bare hands and the toilet water and then it

333
00:21:57.281 --> 00:21:59.330
goes deep and his asshole.
Well,
let me,

334
00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.160
let me tell you why I'm not so opposed to it because the tushy yeah,

335
00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:07.910
and the bid day use the toilet water that's in the tank,

336
00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:11.320
which is using his hand though gene.
Right.
But it's all,
it's all tight.

337
00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:15.200
I'm not on the same.
Okay.
You know.
Well,
yeah,
but you use,
okay,

338
00:22:15.201 --> 00:22:20.120
let's you use your hand to wash your ass hole in the shower.
Okay,
bear.

339
00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:25.010
You don't use a washcloth and shit when I do it.
It's not a shitty ass hole.

340
00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:29.480
It's already very clean butthole.
I know.

341
00:22:29.481 --> 00:22:31.370
I'm just trying to give him the benefit of the doubt.

342
00:22:31.371 --> 00:22:34.820
That's all I used to use to entire rolls of toilet paper.

343
00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:40.950
I have to go on it just gets it.
Wait cleaner.
No toilet.

344
00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.640
Paper's not on the house or no self.
You don't want it.
Don't want it.

345
00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:49.620
Don't hit you on.
Oh no soap too.
Right now.
Wait a minute.

346
00:22:49.621 --> 00:22:53.940
That's just not sanitary for China because he's going to get the poopy on his

347
00:22:53.941 --> 00:22:58.330
hands and his mouth.
Oh,
you need soap buddy.
No,
he's not into it.
Then the ball.

348
00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.370
Why not the soap?
It's Vegan.
There's Vegan soap.

349
00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:06.660
There's gotta be Vegan stuff like Dr Bronner's or whatever that hippie soap at

350
00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.750
wholefoods.
Oh no,
man,
there's gotta be Vegan soap.

351
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:14.970
Know those guys.
He's really,
he's big on pushing his,
uh,

352
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.410
he goes,
you don't like it.
There's no toilet paper.
There's no soap.

353
00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.620
Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
Ah,

354
00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.170
I have problems with that in the past.
No,
I,

355
00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:29.190
I actually think there's a lack of people visiting his home is my guess.

356
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:34.170
I don't think that there's a lot of visitors at all.
No.
No.
I think when they go,

357
00:23:34.171 --> 00:23:37.020
Hey,
did you shave your eyebrows and write vegan on your forehead?

358
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:40.500
And then they go,
maybe I won't come over.
Actually,
I think that happened,

359
00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.530
but the thing is,
is that he's a fairly attractive human.

360
00:23:43.531 --> 00:23:46.100
He's not like the other animal and got to clean ass hole.

361
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.860
<v 3>He said it doesn't even smell.
He doesn't use soap on it.</v>

362
00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:51.830
So how clean candidate he said,
and it doesn't smell.
I trust him.

363
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:56.390
I don't trust him.
Okay.
I don't trust you need soap.
Hey,

364
00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.370
do you want to hear some good news and to septic?

365
00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.510
So much horrible news these days.
Oh my gosh.
Some good news.

366
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:06.620
The chubby chaser took our advice.
Remember that girl?
Yeah,
she wrote in.
Yeah.

367
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:08.810
How do I go?
She writes Hello Jean.

368
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:12.320
I wrote to you about a month ago asking advice on how to approach a Chubby guy I

369
00:24:12.321 --> 00:24:14.910
was interested in and just wanted to give you a followup.

370
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.090
I took your advice and happy to say it worked out.

371
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:21.320
I made the first move like you suggested,
and we went out last weekend.

372
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:26.830
All your suggestions about reassert reassert reassurance and physicality were

373
00:24:27.441 --> 00:24:31.190
spot on as he seemed to loosen up as the night went on.

374
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:34.530
I also went out of my way to make sure that night would be my cheat day.

375
00:24:34.531 --> 00:24:37.390
So I didn't come up with a stuck up bitch.
Food's not good.

376
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.560
We have plans this weekend again,

377
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:44.090
and I can't wait to get to know him better.
Uh,

378
00:24:44.091 --> 00:24:47.240
would he ever date his mom?
Does he like Moose Soup?

379
00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:51.800
Maybe he loves watching studio g clips.
Guests.
We'll find out.

380
00:24:51.801 --> 00:24:56.720
Thanks again.
Hitler.
Your adoring fart mistress Brittany.

381
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:59.110
How about that's fantastic.
Yeah,

382
00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:04.220
<v 2>you guys are doing good.
Glad to hear it.
It's so excite.</v>

383
00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:08.640
Good for you.
I hope you guys get along.
I hope it's a longterm mommy.
Yeah.

384
00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:12.110
You find your genes.
I hope you do.
It's really great.
Really Great.

385
00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:16.790
Everybody finds their jeans.
You know,
it's interesting.
Last night,
uh,

386
00:25:16.791 --> 00:25:20.460
we were watching billions.
We were in bed.
So obsessed with that show.

387
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:24.170
<v 3>It's good entertainment.
That's what it is.</v>

388
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.750
I was thinking about everything is over analyze these days,
you know,
meaning is,

389
00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:32.480
I feel the same way about stand up.
What's the message?
Where's he trying to say?

390
00:25:32.481 --> 00:25:35.750
And then you're like,
it's just funny.
I like this show is just entertaining.

391
00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:37.430
It's just good entertainment.

392
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:40.560
<v 2>It is good.
Yeah.
The guy's got the weird mouth,
the lead character,</v>

393
00:25:40.561 --> 00:25:44.940
but I like him despite that.
Yeah.
And the white voters in it,
the comedian,

394
00:25:44.941 --> 00:25:48.180
comedian,
he's great.
I love the therapist character.

395
00:25:48.181 --> 00:25:52.470
I love his wife character.
She's,
she's a real fucking old school neighborhood.

396
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.990
Crazy.
I like that.
Um,
and so this episode we watched last night,

397
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.120
season two,
they introduced a nonbinary character.

398
00:26:00.121 --> 00:26:03.330
Did nonbinary to other people who have been like,
yeah,

399
00:26:03.331 --> 00:26:05.330
we were watching the show for months.
I know,
but we started,

400
00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:09.900
we always when we might start on walking dead soon.
Yeah.
Maybe game of Thrones,

401
00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:12.830
maybe soprano's we'll get into that wire.
I heard it's good.

402
00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:17.400
We're going to try that soon.
Yup.
Good stuff.
But um,
it was,

403
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:20.890
it's a good day.
You look,
I like this act act was shut down.

404
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.770
I don't even know what to say.
I can't recall them.
An actor or is it actress?

405
00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:28.800
No.
Actor.
Okay.
I like them.

406
00:26:28.801 --> 00:26:33.000
I've seen them because they are really non-binary.
They really are.

407
00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:37.260
And I've seen them on orange is the new black,
it's your pronoun.

408
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:40.380
They,
they are fantastic in that.

409
00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:44.160
<v 3>But uh,
it was cool.
It was interesting</v>

410
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.240
<v 2>to see how they,
they don't really address it.
Dan soders character is like,</v>

411
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:52.920
oh I ordered you lunch.
I assumed you were Vegan and is really funny scene.
Yeah.

412
00:26:52.921 --> 00:26:56.710
And then they go like,
well eventually yes they are making,

413
00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:01.100
which is funny of course.
I mean,
yeah.
And they do do a good job with uh,

414
00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:05.670
somebody else's like,
well she knew what she was talking about.
He's like,
they,
oh,

415
00:27:05.671 --> 00:27:09.380
I didn't see that one.
Oh you bet you must have fallen asleep because they,

416
00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:13.090
and then the person who's got like,
all right,
whatever.

417
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.480
Sure.
But before that,

418
00:27:18.481 --> 00:27:23.180
so we were snuggling in bed with the dogs and everything and I wore a nice night

419
00:27:23.181 --> 00:27:27.530
gown.
I thought it'd be kind of special.
It was nice.
So,
you know,

420
00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:31.020
anyways,
we're snuggling and then you farted

421
00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:38.510
and I let that one go.
I let slide.
I was like,
well,
you know,
fool me once.

422
00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:41.330
And then the second fart rolled around

423
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:46.510
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

424
00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:51.050
<v 2>why do you have to make eye contact with me when you play that drop?</v>

425
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.240
It was kind of playing the sounds like when we read our book or Kid,

426
00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:59.450
those sound books,
you're reading the text and I'm pushing the button

427
00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:05.690
and then I,
I got up and I left because it was offensive.

428
00:28:05.691 --> 00:28:09.650
The second one was so stinky.
And you really pushed,
it wasn't like an oopsie.

429
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:13.390
It was deliberate and I felt like you wanted me to smell it and get them
started.

430
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:19.850
But it occurred to me that because I've been smelling your farts for 12 years

431
00:28:19.851 --> 00:28:24.630
now,
that I could probably guess
guests,

432
00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:27.160
your farts in a lineup.
Like if there were,

433
00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:29.870
I don't know if you really want to get that experiment going and going though.

434
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:33.650
I don't know if you want to ask like,
hey,
how about you guys,

435
00:28:33.651 --> 00:28:36.070
you five guys fart here and uh,

436
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:40.580
I'll stand behind this door and then here's what we can do now.

437
00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.750
I did these experiments in college where I had a roommate that would fart into

438
00:28:44.751 --> 00:28:49.040
film containers and seal the container and then send the far across the country.

439
00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:52.800
Somebody would open it.
You could smell the FARC.
I mean,
did you guys do that too?

440
00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:57.110
My old roommate Kevin and he would mail fart to like his friends back home in

441
00:28:57.111 --> 00:29:00.110
Seattle too.
They would smell it and it works.

442
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:04.730
They mailed me a fart once when I was studying in England and I got a Fart mail

443
00:29:04.731 --> 00:29:09.620
to me.
And it does work.
They mailed me a from the states,
Shawna and Kevin.

444
00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.790
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.
That's neat.

445
00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.050
I mean I'm just saying that's one way we can do the experiment is that it just

446
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:20.750
be cool the mail someone a fart like that and have them open it and then they

447
00:29:20.751 --> 00:29:25.670
just vomit because it smells.
If it catches you off guard,
it's really weird.
Yeah.

448
00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.220
I mean I knew what it was cause we,
we'd done it as roommates.

449
00:29:28.221 --> 00:29:31.040
Like it was a joke in the house.
They really does stay in there.
It does.

450
00:29:31.041 --> 00:29:35.300
And and overseas,
I mean not traveled from the u s t two a England.

451
00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:39.800
Unbelievable.
Really very impressive.

452
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:42.280
Now the key did today would be defined

453
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.770
<v 0>the film container,
cause I don't even know if they,
so by them.
Yeah,
of course.</v>

454
00:29:45.771 --> 00:29:48.310
Like got Amazon.
We can get a bunch of film.
You go to the photo,

455
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:52.350
the photo lab that I went to,
they have to,
it has to be airtight.

456
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:54.340
You could ask them,
you know,
you could do go in there.

457
00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.370
Do you guys have any discarded film canisters?

458
00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.940
Good for like ceiling farts and see if they're like,
ah,
yeah,

459
00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:03.210
you want to nail somebody apart.
Yeah.

460
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:06.970
That's what we sell these over here for a meal and farts to people.
Sure.

461
00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.850
No problem.
I mean,

462
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:13.750
you have to admit that it's a pretty amazing discovery.
Like my old roommate,

463
00:30:13.751 --> 00:30:15.640
Kevin,
discovered it randomly.
Yeah.

464
00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:19.090
And it is pretty revolutionary if you think about it.

465
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:23.080
How else would you mail a fart?
No,
it's incredible.
It's incredible.

466
00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.640
How else could you send the smell?

467
00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:29.200
You could put it in one of those mason jars with like the real,
oh,

468
00:30:29.201 --> 00:30:31.580
that's actually what the seal,
you know that kind.

469
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:36.280
We're used to pull the lever to seal it.
I know you're talking about decorative.

470
00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:41.260
Yeah,
no.
Are Those air tight?
Yeah.
Now here's my thinking.

471
00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.540
Uh,
scientists listening can verify or not.

472
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:48.640
The reason the film canister works so well is because you have less volume in

473
00:30:48.641 --> 00:30:53.350
there.
Yeah.
There's less air.
So really preserves the essence of the fart.

474
00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:54.670
Now my thinking is a mason jar.

475
00:30:54.671 --> 00:30:57.850
It can be very large and maybe you're going to dilute the smell.
Mm.

476
00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:01.780
With all the air molecules.
I have to point this out.
It just,
I just remember,

477
00:31:01.781 --> 00:31:04.990
I don't want to forget.
Okay.
Paternal twins means identical twins.

478
00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:07.950
See now I'm the last week when we were talking about it.
Yes,

479
00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:08.890
we got some messages.

480
00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:13.880
I looked it up and it's not commonly referred to as paternal.
No,

481
00:31:13.881 --> 00:31:16.530
I know her fraternal or identical,
but there.

482
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:21.560
But technically paternal is identical dental meaning the egg splits into two.

483
00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.210
Right,
right.
The same egg.
Right.

484
00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:29.020
So making that point that when we were trying to figure out what that meant,

485
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:31.360
it's been clarified.
Okay.
Well yeah,

486
00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:34.780
somebody wrote identical dicks are important.

487
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:40.840
Hey Hitler,
mommies.
I just wanted to share a story about twin penises with you.

488
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.500
I just had a Hawaiian family move in across the street from me.

489
00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:47.650
The father invited me over to have a few beers with him.

490
00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:51.070
He has twin sons and in the middle of our conversation he said,

491
00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:55.270
I hope they have the same size dick or else one is going to steal the other

492
00:31:55.271 --> 00:31:57.640
one's girlfriend due to having a larger penis.

493
00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.520
My jaw dropped earlier that day.

494
00:32:00.521 --> 00:32:04.630
You guys were having the very important question about twin dicks.

495
00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.060
Sorry,
this doesn't answer the question,

496
00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:10.360
but it's important we find out the answer.

497
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.030
Love always your Bali,

498
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:17.050
you're poly by flipper guy.
Wow.

499
00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:34.000
Well,
this is one of those mysteries that we're going to continue exploring.

500
00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:37.720
Never stop.
Never stop searching nine until justice is served.

501
00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.310
You see that Dick Detectives,
uh,
graphics

502
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:45.200
<v 3>in one lane.
You didn't see this.
Oh my God,
it's so fucking phenomenal.</v>

503
00:32:45.201 --> 00:32:48.590
I'm going to send it,
send the smell,
send this smell.

504
00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:49.973
<v 7>MMM.</v>

505
00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:54.950
<v 2>Here.
I'll pull it up on the screen.
So just give me a second.
In the meantime,
uh,</v>

506
00:32:54.951 --> 00:32:59.290
Tom,
we've been getting a little pushback on a topic very popular and dear to our

507
00:32:59.291 --> 00:33:03.980
hearts.
You know,
Danielle does zoely we know that Dasa.

508
00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:08.150
She changed it to as a ds on Twitter.
Okay.
Danielle?
Yeah,

509
00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:10.450
she writes a,
Hey,
Christina p Tom Sigora.

510
00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:14.740
I know this is an inflammatory statement,
but I've been thinking about it.

511
00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.570
Farts do push the shit out.
Oh,
we're going there again,
Huh?

512
00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:24.820
I mean,
it's thought provoking and,
uh,
let's reopen the topic.

513
00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:27.670
What's the explanation?
I mean we had a great explanation for the other,

514
00:33:27.671 --> 00:33:29.900
for that Shit's push the FARCs out.
Right.

515
00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:33.600
So why is she saying that the opposite though?
She just feels that way.
Oh,

516
00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:37.000
case failing argument.

517
00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:41.290
I mean the other person really laid out that we had it wrong this whole time.

518
00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:43.810
And you're saying that someone said no,
it's the other way,

519
00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.940
but there's no argument.
She said that she's been thinking about,

520
00:33:45.941 --> 00:33:50.260
I guess what she's saying is intuitively it feels as though farts push the shit

521
00:33:50.261 --> 00:33:53.470
as opposed to shits pushing the pharmacy counter intuitive that it sheds.

522
00:33:53.471 --> 00:33:57.610
Put the push the far out.
It's counterintuitive.
It's not logical.
No,

523
00:33:57.611 --> 00:34:01.450
it is logical,
but I feel it's far.
It's do push to shed.
So yeah,

524
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:05.990
but then how do you shit,
okay,
think about it.
Here's the thing.
Here's my case,

525
00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:09.460
Yada is that,
how do I know I have to shit in the morning.

526
00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.010
The forests are coming cause the shits are pushing the farts out.

527
00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:16.600
But the farmers are also simultaneously bushing this shit out.

528
00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:21.190
Oh No.
But then I can't fart without the sh.

529
00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:23.860
I can't shit without the farts.
Okay.

530
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:28.940
<v 3>Okay.
Well,
I think we'll have to a table this have to agree to disagree.
Yeah.</v>

531
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:33.030
We'll wait a little bit longer on this.
Um,
uh,
Bob Brown.
Uh,

532
00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.820
but thank you for supporting the store.
There's all these,
uh,

533
00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:39.870
we have the DJ dad mouth,
that black shirt people asked for that shirt and black,

534
00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:44.940
the rub rub shirt.
Obviously he likes that.
Goes Up.
Cane has a new shirt.
Um,

535
00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:48.120
big daddy Kane and I did together.
Um,

536
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:53.070
uh,
anyways,
and there's moose suit.
There's a two moose soup shirts.

537
00:34:53.071 --> 00:34:55.420
So thanks for everyone.
I always want to say thank you for,

538
00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.900
for getting them and uh,
hope you like to see,

539
00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.740
<v 2>hold on,
I have to Fart.
Like,</v>

540
00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:04.960
you know what maybe should to push the farts out because I can fart without

541
00:35:04.961 --> 00:35:05.794
having,
yeah,

542
00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:07.800
<v 3>I think,
I think we're all good now.</v>

543
00:35:07.801 --> 00:35:11.030
I think we've covered all your thoughts and opinions on this and

544
00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:14.970
<v 2>no,
but think about it.
If I can fart without having to shit.
Yeah.</v>

545
00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:18.440
Then it truly is that shit's pushed the farts out.
Yeah.

546
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:22.580
That's far as don't have to push the shit out.
This is what I wanted to show you.

547
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:24.343
<v 7>Look,</v>

548
00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:29.060
<v 2>it's the state,
the Dick Detectives,
fat head comics.
Oh Wow.</v>

549
00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:32.850
Isn't that fantastic?
Amazing.
Like get her.

550
00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:35.150
But this outline of the deck

551
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:41.310
that's so good deck here in the Dick Detectives.
Great.
It's really fun.

552
00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:45.210
That's really fucking,
that had comics on Instagram and Twitter.

553
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:49.370
Thank you very much for the Dick Detectives.
Graphics don't,
don't,
yeah,

554
00:35:49.371 --> 00:35:52.870
it's really great man.
I'm really impressed.
Do you want to hear some,
uh,

555
00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.800
emails about deaf people?
Yeah.
Okay.

556
00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:01.200
So last time you know,
the problem with this fucking Otterbox,

557
00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:05.490
we asked to how blind people,
uh,
no.

558
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:09.010
Is it deaf people or blind people?
How they wake up?
Definitely.
Yeah.
Clock.
Yeah.

559
00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:12.420
Uh,
this person writes in Bridget,

560
00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:16.140
my college roommate was not deaf,
but would sleep through any alarm.

561
00:36:16.141 --> 00:36:18.240
She bought an alarm made for deaf people.

562
00:36:18.241 --> 00:36:22.840
It was a mat that slid under her mattress and would shake her whole bed at say,

563
00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:23.693
at the set time.

564
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:26.720
<v 3>I've always wondered about,
that's really interesting.</v>

565
00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:31.100
There are people out there that cannot wake up.
Isn't that amazing?

566
00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:36.250
I know.
Um,
I remember my buddy Steve and high school,
we,
you know,

567
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:41.390
we would crash at each other's places all the time and the alarm could be next

568
00:36:41.751 --> 00:36:45.700
to his head.
Oh,
full blast.
And I would be like,

569
00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:49.610
I just look at this dude like,
and you can just go and start shaking him.

570
00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:53.600
Sleeps right through it.
I don't understand that he's touched right.
I know.

571
00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:57.260
I don't think so.
He's slow now.
He's just got a big head.

572
00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:02.260
<v 2>Yeah.
Um,
I know people like that.
I hate people like that.
I know.
And like Bernard</v>

573
00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:07.110
<v 3>pick them up like a Saturday morning,
we'd have a,
you know,
they'd have the Ma,</v>

574
00:37:07.111 --> 00:37:10.740
you got to practice sometimes on Saturday.
So I drive over to his place.

575
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:15.710
I'm pounding on the door that's next to his bedroom,
pound,
pound,
pound.

576
00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:19.980
And I could hear the alarm through the door.
So annoying Jane,

577
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.440
by the way,
my younger sister,

578
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:26.970
if she falls asleep on the couch at midnight and you're like,
oh,

579
00:37:26.971 --> 00:37:30.150
go to bed,
you can,
you can take her.

580
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:34.830
You could drag her off the couch,
leave her head,
hang on the couch.

581
00:37:34.831 --> 00:37:37.110
Her legs are on the couch,
still would wake up,

582
00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:40.560
you can push or you can smack her in the face.

583
00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:44.370
Nothing so crazy.
I don't understand how you could sleep that deeply.

584
00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:47.120
<v 2>I guess their neurological maybe there they shut down.</v>

585
00:37:47.121 --> 00:37:51.290
So completely more so than you know other people.
I don't know.
Yeah.

586
00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.570
But I heard about us once we started asking,

587
00:37:53.571 --> 00:37:57.290
people have come up to me at even at those shows and they said about,
uh,
uh,

588
00:37:57.291 --> 00:38:01.210
shaking bed.
Okay,
well,
here's another one.
Uh,
we asked

589
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:04.560
<v 3>Oh.
Dot.
[inaudible] hold on.</v>

590
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:10.660
<v 2>Another thing is people,
deaf people use flashing lights.</v>

591
00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:15.400
A doorbell ring would be a quick Ding Dong or an on off succession of flashing

592
00:38:15.401 --> 00:38:19.300
lights at a baby.
Crying will be rapidly blinking.
Lights indicate wow.
Wow.
Wow.

593
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:22.930
So like how do they get around the house and do more bells and stuff like that

594
00:38:22.931 --> 00:38:27.550
they use.
Yeah.
But I guess you have to have those lights in the room,
obviously,

595
00:38:27.551 --> 00:38:32.500
that you're in,
right?
Yeah.
Yes,
yes,
of course.
Yeah.
So do you put them everywhere?

596
00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:36.980
I guess so.
I guess so.
Are the whole must blank?
I don't know.
Yeah.

597
00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:38.680
Beats the shit out of me.
Anyway.

598
00:38:38.681 --> 00:38:42.490
Here's another very thought provoking question about blind people that came in.

599
00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:46.030
Corey from Judy,
Dork titties writes in,
Hey Hitler's,

600
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.860
how do blind people find the Braille signage in public places?

601
00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:56.230
No Shit.
Right?
How the fuck did they find it?
That's interesting.

602
00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:57.093
Yeah.

603
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:58.740
<v 3>Yeah.
Dammit.</v>

604
00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:03.800
I mean there's sometimes it makes obvious sense like ATM because you're,

605
00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:08.160
you're finding out where's the ATM and you know,
you,

606
00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:11.970
you're directed towards it by somebody and then once you get there,

607
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
you can read the Braille.
But

608
00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.650
I dunno,
I mean that's,
that's interesting,
right?

609
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:22.920
<v 2>Yeah.
I guess your guide and then maybe have a guide and the guide is,</v>

610
00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:27.060
<v 3>I told you,
this is why he goes about the a,
the time I was in,</v>

611
00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.920
it was in New York and uh,

612
00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:34.290
in Ju Dork titties and there was a blind guy across the street going like this,

613
00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:38.790
waving his hand over his head.

614
00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:44.590
And he started to do it more and more aggressively.
And I guess what it was,

615
00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:49.610
what he was doing was he was signaling that he needed somebody to walk him

616
00:39:49.831 --> 00:39:54.090
across the street,
but he wasn't,
he wasn't nice about it at all.

617
00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:58.980
So when I went up to him,
he goes,
God dammit doing it for 10 fucking minutes.

618
00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:03.960
And then like I walked across the street with him,
you know,
he's like,
God.

619
00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:07.620
And then like when we got to the other side,
he didn't say like thanks.

620
00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:09.270
He was just like mother fucker.

621
00:40:09.271 --> 00:40:13.230
And then he just kept walking because I think that light didn't have the uh,

622
00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:17.640
yeah.
So he just stood there and I was like,
I mean,

623
00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.790
I was hesitant to a pro.
I was,
I don't know what this fucking gun,

624
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:25.770
crazy person waiting,
waiting,
waiting for someone to help him.

625
00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.740
Did she give him a rub?
Rub,
rub to thanks.

626
00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:32.190
So do you want me to kiss you on the penis or anything like that?

627
00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:34.680
And he was like,
yeah.
He's like,
that's why I've been waiting for,

628
00:40:34.681 --> 00:40:38.010
for 10 minutes to sharpen the knife.
You have to,
yeah.

629
00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:41.190
So you have to do sometimes,

630
00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:42.780
<v 2>how's it the comedy store?</v>

631
00:40:42.781 --> 00:40:47.781
This weekend and I took pictures of people and I was talking to fans in the

632
00:40:49.531 --> 00:40:53.420
hallway and people will listen to the show and everybody was like,

633
00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:57.150
[inaudible] you are the personality champ because where's Tom Right now?

634
00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.280
He's not even at the comedy store.
Taking pictures.

635
00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:05.420
<v 3>Absolutely sealed your fate because hundreds of people and punchline Sacramento</v>

636
00:41:07.621 --> 00:41:10.020
where like,
I'll tell you one thing,
Christina didn't meet us

637
00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:12.460
<v 2>after this show and you want to know something?</v>

638
00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:16.070
I'll be a hundred percent honest here.
Yeah.
The reason I did not,
yeah.

639
00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.780
They have metal detectors for people going in.
So I was like,

640
00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:24.790
I'm kinda scared honestly.
And I don't think that our fans are,
uh,
you know,

641
00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.310
gun wielding lunatics.
But I was like,

642
00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:31.450
if they're fucking making these people go through metal detectors,
I mean,

643
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:35.810
you know,
it just spooked me a,
I don't know,
but I still,
I was spooked.

644
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.490
You were spook,
you know,
bed really.
I swear sac down,
Huh?
I swear

645
00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:45.670
<v 3>I had a guy walk by me and he had that mid day drunk swag,</v>

646
00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:50.350
you know,
he was like,
I could see him walking up and he was like,

647
00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.450
I could see he was like talking shit to nobody,

648
00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.710
but you know how alcohol will give you a little more.
And he was like shit.

649
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:58.810
And then as he walked by me,
he was like,

650
00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:03.220
I was born in this city and I'll put my foot up your mother fucking ass.

651
00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:07.750
And I was like,
okay.
And then as he walked by me,
he turned around,
he goes,

652
00:42:07.751 --> 00:42:11.530
come and do it.
The other new you.
I was like this dude,

653
00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:13.990
that means that's some serious shit.

654
00:42:13.991 --> 00:42:16.030
That's like an old school thing to say to you know,

655
00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:20.680
come in as a 20 year old reference in a way that by the club.

656
00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:25.360
No,
this was downtown.
The mattress store and up buy the mattress store.

657
00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:26.460
That location is weird.

658
00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:27.521
<v 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

659
00:42:27.521 --> 00:42:31.170
And that's another reason I'm kind of like scared to meet people.
Yeah.

660
00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:35.290
Because I don't like to locate the mattress stores.
Weird.
Also,

661
00:42:35.291 --> 00:42:37.660
I had a lot of weird experiences and the hotel,

662
00:42:37.661 --> 00:42:41.500
like I feel like there was a lot of just zombies weirdos around.
I was like,

663
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:44.130
I don't know.
It's a weird area,
but at the show you should feel right.

664
00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.970
Like I said,
I trust her mom's house fans,

665
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.900
but there were other people at the shows,
not just mommy's,
you know,

666
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:52.470
like you're one of those Weirdos motherfuckers go stab me or something.

667
00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:55.990
I didn't know that you,
I mean it's different being a woman I guess.
Hell yeah.

668
00:42:56.090 --> 00:43:00.510
<v 3>It was also a different,
having any super sour personality.
Do you know?</v>

669
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:02.550
So maybe that was it.

670
00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:08.210
<v 2>I don't have a sour personality.
That's terrible.
Yeah,</v>

671
00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:12.670
you do.
Look who's fun.
First of all,
I'm fully hydrated.
I have to Fiji water.
Okay.

672
00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:16.550
Super Fun APP is fun.
Guatemala Mug that our nanny got us.
I mean,

673
00:43:16.551 --> 00:43:18.830
got me because I'm fun.
I like to have fun.

674
00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.560
Where's your fun Guatemalan Mug?

675
00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:25.250
She didn't get you one because she knows that your personality doesn't

676
00:43:25.251 --> 00:43:29.660
appreciate fun.
Silly.
Oh my God.
I have an update on bitsy.

677
00:43:29.661 --> 00:43:32.840
So she's been dragging her ass,
scooting,
scooting,
scooting,

678
00:43:32.841 --> 00:43:35.990
and we took her and they checked her anal glands.

679
00:43:35.991 --> 00:43:40.220
She's been on the antibiotics and everything and turns out today she's got our

680
00:43:40.221 --> 00:43:43.520
little rashy on her vulva,
them on her vulva.

681
00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:47.390
So now we have to put cream on our dogs,

682
00:43:47.391 --> 00:43:52.391
vulva three times a day and she's wearing a cone so she can't lick it poor

683
00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:53.550
little.

684
00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:56.930
She's taking three different antibiotics just to make sure we kill whatever it

685
00:43:56.931 --> 00:43:58.100
is that's bothering her badge.

686
00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:01.920
We have to put the cream on our dogs badge three times a day

687
00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:08.120
and now she keeps trying to lick on it and she can't cause the cones on

688
00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:15.660
<v 8>a lot of Gypsies gotten mad that Tom Segura said the word Gypsy on television.</v>

689
00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:21.530
I didn't know Gypsy's had time to watch TV between pick pocketing and scamming

690
00:44:22.561 --> 00:44:23.550
society.

691
00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:24.913
<v 2>All right.</v>

692
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:31.420
<v 3>That is true.
It is true.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I said Gypsy on Conan,
you'll will,</v>

693
00:44:31.421 --> 00:44:35.010
you said say Gyn.
I said,
see again,
but then I translated,
you know,
I said,

694
00:44:35.011 --> 00:44:38.310
I've been teaching my son what my wife teaches me.
You can again,

695
00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:41.640
them don't know had to go in and I said,
you know,
yes,

696
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:44.730
no rotten gypsy and uh,
whatever.

697
00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:48.690
It was just like a throwaway to to set up the song.
The Hungarian song.
Yeah.

698
00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.240
First of all,
Hungarians,
you were right.
You're like,

699
00:44:51.241 --> 00:44:53.790
you're going to have him Gary,
that's come out now.
Yeah.
They love it.
Comes up.

700
00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:57.600
And he's like,
I enjoyed your show.
I understand what you said.
I go,

701
00:44:57.601 --> 00:45:01.530
you understand what I said?
Gone.
Then all your Hungarian,

702
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:05.840
I think it was a meeting us.
He goes,
oh,
and I got good vice than Bozeman.

703
00:45:05.841 --> 00:45:09.450
And he goes,
aw.
And then his friends are like,
what?
He's saying?
What he's saying?

704
00:45:09.451 --> 00:45:10.710
He goes,
he's not nice

705
00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.510
<v 2>on the corner.
He did it go,
you did a really good accent.</v>

706
00:45:14.511 --> 00:45:17.430
And he did it well I should say not good.
He looked like a rock biter too.

707
00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:20.890
Hardcore.
Hardcore guys.
It's funny.
Hungarians are very,

708
00:45:20.891 --> 00:45:24.940
very stoked to be Hungarian.
Yeah.
Cause there's like five of us on the planet.

709
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:28.800
Yeah.
So we're very proud of it.
Yeah,
I understand.
Is nobody who's on gear.

710
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:34.030
<v 3>Well also it's about if we are Hungarian or from that part of the world and</v>

711
00:45:35.931 --> 00:45:39.260
you're here.
Right.
Cause obviously it's crazy.
This is,

712
00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:43.790
this is a long way from home.
So I would,
I mean it makes sense if you're like,

713
00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:47.210
oh are you Bulgarian?
Me Too.
Like that's something to get excited about.
You know,

714
00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:51.050
Lithuanian,
Romanian,
those are all things that

715
00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:55.600
<v 2>Transylvania and there's a very small community.
You don't see it that much.</v>

716
00:45:55.601 --> 00:45:59.710
Just see,
no,
I'm 100% uh,
genetically Hungarian,
like all the way.

717
00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:03.340
They know it's free.
We did that.
Whatever genetic testing and yeah,

718
00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:07.380
like I go back to the whatever Paleo from the,

719
00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:12.580
the big tip patrol.
You definitely,
my tits are big all the way back generations,

720
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:16.390
generations of test.
There was,
it was the whole,
the whole,
the map of the world.

721
00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:20.260
All the region was one.
Yeah.
Are All on my ancestry.
It's pretty nuts.

722
00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:23.680
I'm more diverse.
You are diverse,
but it's crazy.

723
00:46:23.681 --> 00:46:27.940
And now I'm responsible for bringing my lineage to this part of the world.

724
00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:31.870
Or my parents were Rad.
That's true.
That's true.
No,
I am.
Cause I had the sun.

725
00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:36.610
We got it.
We have a little half hung go.
Boy He is totally half hung.
Go tough.

726
00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:41.410
Yeah.
Yes he was.
I don't like naps.
I like work.

727
00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:46.870
Wow.
Cause your first words,
I'd say guide.

728
00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:49.850
<v 3>Speaking of that part of the world,
do you want to hear an accent?</v>

729
00:46:49.851 --> 00:46:53.600
It's pretty interesting to see if you can decipher what's being said.
Oh boy,

730
00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.060
<v 9>how you doing?
Hey you got a someday</v>

731
00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:00.850
we'll back at pier nine.

732
00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:12.710
<v 2>Well it's not really fair because I do think there's a little bit of
drunkenness.</v>

733
00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:17.390
Wait with WHO and mental element with this guy.
Well it was submitted.

734
00:47:17.391 --> 00:47:21.330
They said,
ah,
you guys know accents so well.
Again,
it's,

735
00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.940
it's also nonsensical because he's drug and probably schizophrenia.

736
00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:29.380
<v 3>I don't know about your diagnosis.
I don't support it.
Um,</v>

737
00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:34.650
I'm saying if he may have had a drink yet today or maybe the day before he had a

738
00:47:35.481 --> 00:47:39.160
drink and he's just about to enjoy his cigarette.
It's possible.

739
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:40.120
But I don't think that,

740
00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:44.950
let's just go back to what he's saying and not focus on your root diagnosis.

741
00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:50.140
So let's see here.
Okay.
Clearly the first man says,
Hey,
Dan,

742
00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:54.160
how you doing?
Yeah,
I got that part.
You got that part down a Silva.

743
00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:58.810
He said [inaudible]
good for nothing.

744
00:47:58.811 --> 00:47:59.930
For nothing.
Got Done.
Yeah.

745
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:01.543
<v 9>Huh?</v>

746
00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:08.620
<v 3>No.
Wooly mcateer is Kwan.
Oh,
wine mammoth.
Really?</v>

747
00:48:08.621 --> 00:48:10.770
Mcafee racketeering.
Kwon.

748
00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:14.840
<v 9>That's it.
The goddamn room.</v>

749
00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:19.220
<v 3>Yeah.
Beirut Goddamn roosters.
And then,</v>

750
00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:22.520
<v 9>uh,
say that Sunday.
So Leslie Day.</v>

751
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:26.160
<v 3>Okay.
Lovely Day.
Excuse me,</v>

752
00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:32.730
the old one.
Yeah.
Crap,
crap,

753
00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:36.630
blah,
blah.

754
00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:41.660
He sounded like Cosby a little loud and reminded me of that amazing song.

755
00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:47.290
Um,
do you remember where is it?
Uh,

756
00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:51.600
when we did the,
what was it,
the Irvine show?
Yes.

757
00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:57.060
One of the songs is the vocal fry champ,
but they use,

758
00:48:57.210 --> 00:49:02.040
they use the,
um,
they use the,
the drunk guy,

759
00:49:02.041 --> 00:49:03.600
I think he's also Irish.
She's like,

760
00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:10.140
yeah.
That was like,
yeah,

761
00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:14.693
this guy.

762
00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:18.373
<v 10>Ah,</v>

763
00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:46.500
it's

764
00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:47.930
<v 3>amazing.
Um,</v>

765
00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:53.730
that's a gaping dad at the vocal fry song.
I have to say.
We got,
you know,

766
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:57.960
every once in a while you get so much.
Um,

767
00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:00.120
so many replies,

768
00:50:00.121 --> 00:50:05.121
responses and excitement about songs that Matt Mercer Song from last week.

769
00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:12.000
People flipped out.
Yeah,
it was good.
Really good.
I realized too,
I was like,

770
00:50:12.001 --> 00:50:16.530
man,
I know he's made other songs for us.
And uh,
he made,

771
00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:21.420
let me see.
What is it?
Vocal fry he made.

772
00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:26.040
Uh,
what is it?
It's the river song.
Yeah.
Look at the river.
Remember that one?

773
00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:29.990
You spit when you heard the song the first time he made this song.

774
00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:33.370
<v 10>Ooh.
Ooh.</v>

775
00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:36.140
Alright,
here we go.

776
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:40.610
I'm going over the new bridge.

777
00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:01.430
<v 1>Here we go.</v>

778
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:24.570
<v 3>Does Matt Mercer also?
That's amazing.
It was so funny.
Yeah.</v>

779
00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:29.620
God I doubt is ridiculous.
Yeah.
Hey,
wait a minute.
Stop the presses.
Oh,
what,

780
00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:34.090
what do you have a dental update?
Oh my God.
I have the biggest dental update,
but,

781
00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:36.790
but before I even get into the dental update,

782
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:42.160
let me remind people,
now that we're pulling out those songs,

783
00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:44.920
every time I log in to Facebook,

784
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:50.200
I'll see Facebook,
Facebook,
cause I see hundreds,

785
00:51:50.290 --> 00:51:55.030
I'm not exaggerating,
hundreds of unread messages.

786
00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:59.650
We don't do it.
We don't,
we'll send emails and they go check out.

787
00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:04.690
We only access things for the show from our g mail account.
Yeah.

788
00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:09.220
So if you have a song,
if you have a clip,
if you have a story,

789
00:52:09.221 --> 00:52:12.190
if you have a message for Fargo,
you'd want to send them the canister,

790
00:52:12.310 --> 00:52:13.143
all of that.

791
00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:18.070
It's your mom's podcast@gmail.com that is,

792
00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:19.990
there's no house in the email address.

793
00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:24.910
Your Mom's podcast@gmail.com.

794
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.540
I just want it to make it clear.
If you've been sending stuff on Facebook.

795
00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:31.860
We don't,
we don't check it out.
Social media.
All right.

796
00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:35.710
Hi.
It's so big.
I can't believe we forgot it.
I know.

797
00:52:57.990 --> 00:53:02.840
<v 5>So it's been a,
I</v>

798
00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:04.190
<v 3>will say I've been pretty good.</v>

799
00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:08.870
I've been pretty good lately with dental care.
Uh,

800
00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:12.810
this is the,
I went seven months,
you know,
he's supposed to do every six.
Yeah.

801
00:53:12.811 --> 00:53:16.190
So seven months ago I had my teeth cleaned.

802
00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:18.500
I went back for a cleaning,

803
00:53:18.501 --> 00:53:23.450
but I also scheduled a in house whitening treatment.

804
00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:25.980
Hold on.
Before we get there,
how

805
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:29.970
<v 0>was your report card?
What was your gum score?
Oh,
I was,
I was,
uh,</v>

806
00:53:29.971 --> 00:53:34.600
just as solid as last time.
Yeah,
no,
what's that?
Okay.

807
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:37.230
And he was just hitting your numbers.
Let's hear them.
Or I forget,

808
00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:41.080
I forget which number is cause I always hear at one to two,

809
00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:44.360
two like I'm always really good.
Yeah,
that's what he says.

810
00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:46.680
You're probably like eight and actually you want to know the truth.

811
00:53:46.681 --> 00:53:47.880
You can call him and ask him this.

812
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:50.770
You said it best set of teeth I've seen in a year.
Peeling.
Yeah,

813
00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:55.500
that's an inaccurate because he said that about my teeth and I was there less

814
00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:59.330
than a year ago.
Thank you very much.
So I'm the teeth champion.
He,

815
00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:02.280
there's so much better than yours.
If we,
if we did teeth champ,

816
00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:06.840
I'm definitely the teeth.
Lilo's disagree.
Disagree.
He's like,

817
00:54:06.841 --> 00:54:09.870
you have dog teeth.
No,
my God,
my teeth are so much better than yours.

818
00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:12.000
Always have those canine problems.

819
00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:16.360
What canine tooth file down all the time.
Your teeth are sharp and,

820
00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:20.550
and Jag like Jag had tic tacs.
Look how white they are anyways.

821
00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:25.300
Barely can see them though because of your big lips and facial hair.

822
00:54:25.301 --> 00:54:30.030
Are you done?
Go ahead.
So I went there.
The cleaning was,

823
00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:34.710
was fun and fine and it wasn't fun,
but painless.

824
00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:39.180
The cleaning was okay.
No problem.
Yeah,
nope.
No blood,
no good.
It was,

825
00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:40.053
I was all good

826
00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:42.650
<v 3>when they're done.
I was like,
oh,
that was actually pretty quick.</v>

827
00:54:42.651 --> 00:54:45.770
Then they go and now we're going to do the whitening and man,

828
00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:51.800
so first they put this thing to give like so you can give blowjobs like it opens

829
00:54:51.801 --> 00:54:54.070
your mouth up really big.
And uh,

830
00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:58.000
I posted that picture on Instagram who's did real well?
People really like it.
Um,

831
00:54:58.210 --> 00:55:00.620
and then they put,
they did not want to get,
we'll give you braces.

832
00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:05.310
They tried to embarrass,
separate your,
your lips from touching.
Yeah.

833
00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:06.440
Where your teeth are going to be.

834
00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:10.980
Then they put a protective gel on your gum line.
Hmm.

835
00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:13.280
Um,
and then after that,

836
00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:18.310
then they put this fucking hydrochloric acid on your teeth to start bleeding and

837
00:55:18.591 --> 00:55:21.410
then they do multiple rounds for an hour.

838
00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:24.680
So the first round went by and I'm like,
oh,
la.
I had my,

839
00:55:24.681 --> 00:55:28.650
thank God I had the headphones,
I was listening to a podcast.
Um,

840
00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:33.380
then I go mother Fucker,
second round I started,
oh,

841
00:55:33.381 --> 00:55:37.780
I go like this,
um,
to wipe something on my lip and my,

842
00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:41.690
my finger touches it and did.
She goes,
you're gonna burn your hand.
And I'm like,

843
00:55:41.691 --> 00:55:45.020
okay.
So she wiped my hand.
We'll a little bit,
got on my lip,

844
00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:49.010
started burning my lip.
So I had to write on my phone,
my lip is burning,

845
00:55:49.070 --> 00:55:54.070
and then she took a cloth and she wiped my lip by the third round.

846
00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:55.573
Um,

847
00:55:56.030 --> 00:56:00.380
I was definitely feeling burning in my gums and a a little bit on my tongue.

848
00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:02.250
Oh God.
That's the worst.

849
00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:07.010
He did a thing where she sprayed into the gum line and then sucked it out right

850
00:56:07.011 --> 00:56:10.610
away.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That helps.
But after that final round,
I was like,

851
00:56:10.930 --> 00:56:13.020
this is burning pretty bad.
You know,
man,

852
00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:17.780
that night I had a like shooting pains in my teeth.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Well,

853
00:56:17.781 --> 00:56:22.100
you're burning enamel,
the layers of enamel off your teeth,
but it is worth it.

854
00:56:22.210 --> 00:56:24.070
It's worth it.
I mean,
your

855
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:28.810
<v 0>teeth look so much better now.
I'm so happy for you.
They're not buttery yellow.</v>

856
00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:29.711
Again.

857
00:56:29.711 --> 00:56:33.010
People don't really see your teeth a lot because you don't smile much cause

858
00:56:33.011 --> 00:56:36.840
you're not a good personality.
You don't have a good personality.
Yeah.
Um,

859
00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:39.400
so I don't know if it's totally lost money,
you know what I mean?

860
00:56:39.850 --> 00:56:44.290
But it's good that it's there.
The teeth are white.
Appreciate you.
Appreciate you,

861
00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:48.660
appreciate your thoughts.
It's been nicer looking at you.
Tell you that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

862
00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:52.720
I bet it is.
Yeah.
Um,
you're so mean to your parents.

863
00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:56.650
You're always like,
can I pay for you guys to do it?
Please?

864
00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:04.240
It's true.
I wanted to,
do you think your dad would do it?
Your Dad needs it.

865
00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:08.550
Can they treat dad now?
Like if you were to go,

866
00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:14.970
I don't know if they would actually treat him because I remember when she said,

867
00:57:15.791 --> 00:57:17.740
we're going to your tie your teeth whitening.
I go,
yeah,
she goes,

868
00:57:17.741 --> 00:57:21.940
show me your teeth.
And she held up like this,

869
00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:26.710
all these little teeth on a,
on a,
uh,
I guess on a,
what's it called?

870
00:57:27.130 --> 00:57:30.250
On a thing.
Uh,
like a stick like yeah.

871
00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:34.390
To see all the different shades that your teeth aren't going to be as.
She goes,

872
00:57:34.391 --> 00:57:39.330
okay,
you're in this shade.
And she goes,
you're lucky it's um,

873
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:43.660
yellow and not gray.
She goes,
if it's gray,
this won't work.

874
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:47.890
She goes with yellow on it.
Like a yellow hue means we can,

875
00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:51.220
you can lift the color.
She goes grey.
We can't do it.
Interesting.

876
00:57:51.790 --> 00:57:56.020
So you're saying that your dad's gray,
I think a lot of old people are gray.
Yeah.

877
00:57:56.021 --> 00:57:57.990
Right.
Yeah.
That's rotten.
Yeah.
And that,

878
00:57:58.020 --> 00:58:02.230
that's probably what it adds to the dad mouth is the grayness of the teeth.

879
00:58:02.231 --> 00:58:04.630
It's probably the bacteria,
the dying,

880
00:58:04.631 --> 00:58:08.580
decaying teeth in your head or making your mouth stink bad.
Yeah.

881
00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:13.240
So lots of his and your gums are probably old and stinky too.

882
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.920
It's just probably the age of your mouth that makes you dads get dad mail and

883
00:58:17.921 --> 00:58:19.960
just what kind of maintenance are you doing?
Like anything else.

884
00:58:19.961 --> 00:58:22.930
So you taking care of it,
got to maintain,
you got to maintain.
Yeah.

885
00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:28.060
I don't think your dad flosses would you say that he flosses no,
no,

886
00:58:29.350 --> 00:58:32.950
no.
And probably reluctantly goes,
you know,

887
00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:36.960
to get things done like,
yeah,
teeth and gum care.
I'm sure.

888
00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:42.280
Oh God.
Got to go there again.
Like I went last year.
I know you didn't,
well,

889
00:58:42.281 --> 00:58:46.240
I went two years ago like that.
Does your mom floss?

890
00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:51.160
[inaudible] I'm sure she doesn't.
Yeah,
that's my guess.
I Dunno.

891
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.380
Maybe like she's the kindness,
like,
oh,
this is annoying.
I just had,

892
00:58:56.381 --> 00:59:00.940
corn is bothering me.
Let's get it out.
Most people,
I like that.

893
00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:04.410
I say that's when most people floss.
That's,
but that's the only time I,

894
00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:06.970
I haven't seen her.
We were like,
oh,
I got floss.
I'm going to bed.

895
00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:12.430
My sisters are actually really good at dental care.
Both Jane's got great teeth.

896
00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:16.510
I remail always remember Maria like flossing all the time.

897
00:59:16.511 --> 00:59:19.990
It's got great teeth too.
Yup.
Very High Joes who are good at it,

898
00:59:19.991 --> 00:59:22.430
but the folks not

899
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:23.263
<v 2>so much.</v>

900
00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:28.410
<v 11>My name is Daniel Pauly,
Etsy,
and I'm a cat consulting advice.</v>

901
00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:32.130
500 individual clients and their cats.

902
00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:36.630
<v 2>So this asshole,
wait,
it gets better.</v>

903
00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:39.530
<v 11>Today we visited bill.
Bill has three cats.</v>

904
00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:42.410
One is urinating on bill while he was sleeping.

905
00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:47.810
Actually surrendered to my advice and ask a cat permission for what he wants.

906
00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:54.390
<v 2>That's the kind of advice that's going to get if your cat is fucking pissing on</v>

907
00:59:54.391 --> 00:59:55.470
you or your dog,

908
00:59:56.130 --> 01:00:01.130
I'd say that's a sign of severe behavioral problems of the cat and the cat does

909
01:00:01.171 --> 01:00:04.860
not respect you.
This guide,
as I see it this way,
he thinks,

910
01:00:05.070 --> 01:00:06.750
wait till you hear the language he uses.

911
01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:11.940
<v 11>I teach clients
love.</v>

912
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:13.490
These cats are trying to tell

913
01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:22.080
<v 2>I am the voice.
Is this the fundamental difference?
The divide,
if you will,</v>

914
01:00:22.081 --> 01:00:26.280
between cat and dog people.
Is that the cat people?
Armando,

915
01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:29.310
you were talking about how we're on the brink of civil war in this country,

916
01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:33.840
but what were you saying?
No,
no,
no.
The very important stuff going on.

917
01:00:33.841 --> 01:00:35.930
We don't talk about that.
Uh,

918
01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:39.450
the very important divide between cat and dog people is that people who,

919
01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:43.140
who love cats really love being treated poorly and they,

920
01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:48.240
they see themselves as submissive to the cats dog people,
aren't we?

921
01:00:48.241 --> 01:00:52.920
I don't think.
Where is that?
That way?
No,
you have to be dominant.

922
01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:56.790
That's what he said.
He wants him to his human clients to be better,

923
01:00:57.450 --> 01:01:01.260
uh,
to be better slaves and cat.

924
01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:04.620
But I'm saying my best friend's a cat person and she's always talking about,

925
01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.890
you know,
the cat's being a jerk and that,

926
01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:11.220
but they are submissive to the cats needs.
It's different in the dog world,

927
01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:15.630
you have to ignore door,
the dominant dominant.
You have to otherwise the dog,

928
01:01:16.170 --> 01:01:18.960
they have free reign and it's not healthy for them.
I don't like it.

929
01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:22.260
I'm just saying it's two different worlds.
I'm not judging it.
Troll,

930
01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:25.230
they need rules and boundaries and guidelines.

931
01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:29.370
Cats set the tone of the house and then you and they're free roam.
Yeah.

932
01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:33.600
I think it's harder to discipline a cat.
How do you even,

933
01:01:34.110 --> 01:01:36.990
I've had cats growing up.
You don't,
you just don't.
Right.

934
01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:39.810
You just do what they do and you adapt.
Yeah,
exactly.

935
01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.370
They fuck up your house and Piss on you while you sleep,

936
01:01:42.371 --> 01:01:46.390
piss on your face and you're just like,
well that's what my kitty does.

937
01:01:47.410 --> 01:01:51.930
He finally asked for permission to,
yeah.
Walk me through this.

938
01:01:51.931 --> 01:01:54.210
Is there more?
Oh,
there's more.
I love it.

939
01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:58.420
<v 11>My concentration is finding out what's going on with the cap to not only</v>

940
01:01:58.421 --> 01:02:00.750
understand the body language,
but the emotions.
Oh,

941
01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:02.710
there's your favorite favorite staying right there.

942
01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:06.830
<v 2>Oh,
that's some good stuff right there.
He's monitor.
See,
my favorite would be,</v>

943
01:02:06.831 --> 01:02:08.570
he goes right.
See He's,
um,

944
01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.680
he's upset about when you leave without telling him.

945
01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:18.170
And I go,
um,
I think he's happy right here.

946
01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:20.040
And then he goes,

947
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.070
<v 0>no,
he's not.
How do you know that?
Right.</v>

948
01:02:23.071 --> 01:02:26.640
How do you not know that what you're interpreting as his actual

949
01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:29.950
<v 3>thing out or anxiety is in his joy?
Did,</v>

950
01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:34.510
<v 0>is there anything as Diet?
Did you read his diary when he went to bed last night?</v>

951
01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:39.070
He has tattoos of cats on his body.
He wears cat apparel.

952
01:02:39.071 --> 01:02:41.440
The guy is an expert.
Okay,
sure.

953
01:02:41.810 --> 01:02:46.780
<v 11>My experience comes from working in the animal shelter system.
It's hard work.</v>

954
01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:51.200
My last job,
because I love the people and I love cats.

955
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:54.090
<v 0>I wonder if he knows our friend that also works in the animal.</v>

956
01:02:54.091 --> 01:02:56.670
Should probably should ask her.
Yeah.
Was like,
Hey,

957
01:02:56.671 --> 01:02:59.590
do you know this clown that does a cat consulting?
Well,

958
01:02:59.591 --> 01:03:01.980
my friend also loves cats too.
She might,

959
01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:04.380
they might be a match made in heaven actually might be perfect for you.

960
01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:09.390
<v 11>Um,
you can learn a lot.
It's kind of vocal fry cats.
They live in Wilmington.</v>

961
01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:13.440
<v 0>Here we go.
I'd say all dog owners,
they're stupid.</v>

962
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:18.020
<v 3>Here's their emotions.
I'm happy to see you.
I'm getting upset.</v>

963
01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:20.000
Let's be best friends.
I'm interested.

964
01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:25.490
I'm crazy about you feeling loving.
I'm worried,

965
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:26.250
Huh?

966
01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:28.260
<v 11>Oh,
cats.
Cats.</v>

967
01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:33.890
Sure lands to and I think that's what a lot of people don't necessarily do.

968
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:36.510
Cats live in the meow.

969
01:03:37.090 --> 01:03:41.990
<v 0>Oh,
that's cute.
Cats live in them.
Yeah.
I love that.
Of course you do.</v>

970
01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:46.660
They live in them.
Yeah.
Right?
Yeah.
Right?
Yeah.

971
01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:51.520
Press pause.
Hey,
do you think we're going to get a cat soon?
That'd be fun.
No,

972
01:03:51.790 --> 01:03:55.780
come on.
You can't let it be an outdoor cat.
I'm not against it as a species,

973
01:03:55.781 --> 01:04:00.550
but I'm allergic to them and we suck.
Yeah.
I like having cat around cancer fund.

974
01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:03.040
What does this person was saying?
Catch everything.

975
01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:05.410
I know too much about my dad preferences

976
01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:10.900
with all the talk of Tom and not wanting to know what gets Topdog hard.

977
01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:15.250
I can top that.
God.
After my dad's second marriage ended,

978
01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:17.500
we live together just the two of us.

979
01:04:17.530 --> 01:04:21.130
Eventually we got fairly comfortable with each other and he started dating
again.

980
01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:25.210
One night he came home from a date.
I asked him the usual,
so how'd it go?

981
01:04:25.690 --> 01:04:29.650
He smiled and then proceeded to shove two of his fingers.

982
01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:33.490
He just used a stir.
His dates paint up to my nose.

983
01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:37.210
Oh whoa.
Now she's my stepmom.

984
01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:40.810
Uh,
keep it high and tight.

985
01:04:40.811 --> 01:04:43.600
Storm and Nasty as oh fuck

986
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:48.050
<v 3>storm.
That could be a guy or a girl.</v>

987
01:04:49.570 --> 01:04:53.020
<v 0>Perfect show for this.
Yeah.
That's really,</v>

988
01:04:53.110 --> 01:04:56.910
I don't know why parents don't understand that even though they're adult,

989
01:04:57.070 --> 01:04:59.740
everybody's an adult.
The child being an adult as well.
Yeah.

990
01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:03.070
We don't want to know things about your life.

991
01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:07.870
I have a friend named who is living with his dad and his dad fucks.

992
01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:12.310
Yeah,
the door open.
Yes.
Yes.
He told me about that.
And then he was like,
Dad,

993
01:05:12.550 --> 01:05:15.430
please can you shut the door when you fuck your girlfriend?

994
01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:19.750
And he was like your dogs in.
And he said,

995
01:05:19.751 --> 01:05:23.830
the dog gets nervous if I shut the door.
She was like,
I don't care man.

996
01:05:23.831 --> 01:05:27.340
I don't want to hear you.
Fuck.
Don't you love his dad was just like,

997
01:05:27.341 --> 01:05:28.930
what is your deal?
It's your problem.

998
01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:33.190
The dads are narcissists who don't even think about the children's feelings or

999
01:05:33.191 --> 01:05:35.600
anything,
right?
Why?
Why should your friend,
uh,

1000
01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:39.760
have a right to say anything but don't you love when people have lame excuses

1001
01:05:39.761 --> 01:05:42.080
for stuff like that?
Like,
well,
the dog,
the dog,

1002
01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:46.720
I have to traumatize my son by fucking,
uh,
in front of him,

1003
01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:51.700
which I could close the door.
The dog,
the dog,
you asshole.

1004
01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:54.790
You're just an asshole.
He's a dog.
He's a p one fucking

1005
01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:01.420
stupidest reason.
Another email came in.

1006
01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:06.190
Do Blind people dream?
Listen,
if so,

1007
01:06:06.191 --> 01:06:09.730
do they dream in pictures,
smells or touches?
Gosh,
let's see.

1008
01:06:09.731 --> 01:06:11.630
That's a good question too.
Well,
I dunno.

1009
01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:13.840
I feel like it's obvious that they dream,
they dream,

1010
01:06:13.841 --> 01:06:17.710
but do they dream the same way that sighted people do because we see things?

1011
01:06:17.950 --> 01:06:21.460
How did they seen her mind's eye?
Well,
they have a vivid imagination,

1012
01:06:21.461 --> 01:06:26.270
I'm assuming,
right?
I don't know if you're blind.
Can you tell?
I mean,

1013
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:31.240
but here's the thing,
what you describe would it be,
you know what I mean?

1014
01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:34.840
How do they know that they're seeing things differently than we do in our mind's

1015
01:06:34.841 --> 01:06:38.890
eye?
They don't know.
Unless you've been had your sight and then lost the right.

1016
01:06:39.090 --> 01:06:42.270
If you were born blind,
how do they know?
How do we,

1017
01:06:42.310 --> 01:06:47.310
how do we now trucks all day when your dreams are like fucking psychedelic?

1018
01:06:48.350 --> 01:06:51.470
Showdowns I love it.
No,
I don't.
I don't want to know what,

1019
01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:55.360
how you would describe what you see in your dreams.
Oh,

1020
01:06:55.361 --> 01:06:59.710
here's an email that came in about,
uh,
playing against disabled kids.

1021
01:06:59.950 --> 01:07:04.120
Last week I talked about a,
in football,
when we beat the deaf school,
it said,

1022
01:07:04.121 --> 01:07:07.460
hearing you talk about playing the deaf because of football sparked when you,

1023
01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:09.940
my classic memories from Childhood,
I am from Indiana.

1024
01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:14.110
We're basketball is life and in grade school I was playing against a team that

1025
01:07:14.111 --> 01:07:16.390
had a kid with a nub for a left arm.

1026
01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:21.370
I had to apprehensively guard him and immediately wanted to jump off a building.

1027
01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:25.990
When my super intense competitive dad yells from the stance,

1028
01:07:26.350 --> 01:07:30.370
make them go left with a whole gym to hear classic.

1029
01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:34.420
Just thought I would share.
Thanks for the most entertaining podcasts out there.

1030
01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:38.920
You make my 10 hour work day.
Go quickly keeping it high and tight bow.

1031
01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:42.960
Thanks Bo.
Yeah,
I remember playing in those little league games,
uh,

1032
01:07:42.970 --> 01:07:47.860
against a few nubs too.
Yeah,
there was always a,
in the little rec league teams,

1033
01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:51.190
they always had like a kid,
you know,
missing a hand or something.

1034
01:07:51.191 --> 01:07:56.020
Like in basketball there was some drug in the fifties I think that mothers were

1035
01:07:56.021 --> 01:07:56.854
taking,
I had,

1036
01:07:56.860 --> 01:08:00.520
I had a teacher in college who had the baby arm thing too and it was from some

1037
01:08:00.521 --> 01:08:04.000
drug.
They gave her money in football.
By the way,
I saw,
I've seen it on the news.

1038
01:08:04.001 --> 01:08:07.590
I'm sure people have seen this on the news.
There's this clip or you know,
with,

1039
01:08:07.591 --> 01:08:08.411
with social media,

1040
01:08:08.411 --> 01:08:13.411
it's made its rounds these days of this guy who played in high school game with

1041
01:08:13.601 --> 01:08:16.490
no legs flow.
He's just like,

1042
01:08:16.491 --> 01:08:21.491
he has little nub legs and he would waddle out there and actually play football.

1043
01:08:22.190 --> 01:08:26.630
How did he,
did he have like a machine,
like a wheelchair apparatus?
No,
seriously.

1044
01:08:26.631 --> 01:08:30.320
He would just on whatever legs did happen,
I think he had like,
uh,

1045
01:08:31.150 --> 01:08:33.830
like half arms full arms either.

1046
01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:39.040
And so he would play on the line and they would,
you know,
would just go out.
Uh,

1047
01:08:39.090 --> 01:08:40.010
it was,
I mean,

1048
01:08:40.011 --> 01:08:44.930
that was amazing to see that this kid wanted to do that that badly.
Yeah,

1049
01:08:44.931 --> 01:08:46.970
Dude.
Well,
if there's a will,
there's a way.
Yeah.

1050
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:49.430
And I guess now to a technology they can,
you know,

1051
01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:51.830
maybe you can build things to help some.
Yeah.
Well,

1052
01:08:51.831 --> 01:08:54.890
I don't think he could do that in this particular case,

1053
01:08:54.891 --> 01:08:59.870
but I'm saying like other stuff.
Yeah.
That's cool.
That's pretty nice.
Nice.

1054
01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:04.280
Um,
what's it called when you want to burp vomit.
Oh,
please.

1055
01:09:04.281 --> 01:09:06.500
I don't want to hear this topic.
My girlfriend's,

1056
01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:10.790
Suzanne and I were intrigued by new vocabulary when you try to shit,

1057
01:09:10.791 --> 01:09:15.530
but only a fart.
My favorite is impostor,
which is a good one.
And then booster.

1058
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:19.400
Yes,
I like that one a lot,
but while we were hugging ourselves the orgasm,

1059
01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:23.810
we were wondering why there's no word for when you try to Burp,

1060
01:09:23.811 --> 01:09:27.800
but you accidentally bump.
There is a word we propose the word Europe.

1061
01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:32.540
No verb.
No.
Also what if you cough and then vomit.
That's called the comments.

1062
01:09:32.541 --> 01:09:36.560
Stop it.
I know that mommy,
Tina loves her vomit,
so this will be helpful.

1063
01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:41.600
Love John and Suzanne.
Now being the,
the metaphor they,
I am.

1064
01:09:41.601 --> 01:09:46.010
Stop it.
I know the word.
It is called a birth ball.

1065
01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:48.650
A birth when you go to Burp,
but you vomit.

1066
01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:51.680
It is a birth and I haven't had a birth and several years,

1067
01:09:51.681 --> 01:09:53.870
but as a child had several bursts.
I Dunno.

1068
01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:56.240
For some reason childhood there is always,

1069
01:09:56.660 --> 01:10:00.750
you're always pushing out burps and so you'd birth,
yeah,
that happens,
right?
Yeah.

1070
01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:03.980
Yeah.
I hated barfing.

1071
01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:07.470
That was the worst because I need to remember,

1072
01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:10.370
need to have to take a sip of like cactus cooler or Dr Pepper.

1073
01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:17.280
Yeah.
Yeah.

1074
01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:21.980
Took me out.
I know I'm really on top of it.
I had to get those fingers ready.

1075
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:24.590
Yeah.
Okay.
We're back.

1076
01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:27.800
No we're not and I don't trust you and why don't you trust me the minute I put

1077
01:10:27.801 --> 01:10:30.640
these headphones on,
you're going to play another barf clip.
I know you.

1078
01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:32.420
I won't quote.

1079
01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:37.490
You look so much like Robin Williams when you smile,

1080
01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:41.300
you always say that more like patch Adams though.

1081
01:10:41.301 --> 01:10:45.950
I don't know why I don't look like patch Adams.
Oh well I do know I knew it.

1082
01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:47.630
I can fucking hear it.
Oh yeah.

1083
01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:50.023
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1084
01:10:52.770 --> 01:10:56.850
<v 0>You're the worst.
Yeah,
I'm not going to stop it.</v>

1085
01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.770
I can hear it in the headphones stall.
Okay.

1086
01:10:59.370 --> 01:11:02.670
Did I tell you the email that this girl wrote in on wild back?
No.

1087
01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:05.370
I'm not going to put these on.
If you play barf clips,

1088
01:11:07.890 --> 01:11:12.480
your trigger finger is hot.
Let me see your hands.
Put your hands up.

1089
01:11:12.570 --> 01:11:14.280
Okay.
Anyways,

1090
01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:18.330
there is a girl who wrote in cause she knows I'm in a metaphor.

1091
01:11:18.430 --> 01:11:23.430
Yeah and does that what is called a metaphor he met to phobia to EMS is to throw

1092
01:11:24.481 --> 01:11:25.680
up e m e t.

1093
01:11:25.730 --> 01:11:30.730
O that I meant to phobia and she said there's a pill you can take that will

1094
01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:35.610
paralyze your stomach so that you don't vomit.
Have you taken it now?

1095
01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.760
Did you get it?
Yeah,
you do have it.

1096
01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:40.710
Well cause I read about it and like let's say you had the stomach flu or

1097
01:11:40.711 --> 01:11:43.560
something.
It's just spasms of the stomach muscle.

1098
01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:45.720
It's not necessary to vomit.

1099
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:49.230
I know what you're doing and I find some sneaky,

1100
01:11:51.810 --> 01:11:53.450
sneaky.
There's something sneaky happened.

1101
01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:58.170
You think I'm fucking Nudie to you dude,
dude,
I know your farts in a lineup.

1102
01:11:58.171 --> 01:12:00.960
I know what you're doing.
You know it's not,
there's nothing over here like that.

1103
01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:04.950
There isn't.
There's nothing on this like that.
I promise.
I promise.

1104
01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:11.810
I swear this one doesn't have it.
This one doesn't have it.

1105
01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:15.560
This one has
that

1106
01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:20.850
better watch out.
I'm just saying this one doesn't have that.

1107
01:12:20.851 --> 01:12:24.540
Do you want me to touch your penis then?
Don't play anymore.
Pew Clips.

1108
01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:28.470
Come on.
Don't ruin the fun for everybody.
Fun.

1109
01:12:28.830 --> 01:12:30.770
Do you know how much the audience likes when you've made my,

1110
01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:36.190
they messaged me about the topic and they like it.
That's terrible.

1111
01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:40.290
They like my suffering.
Yeah,
they like it.
They react.
It's a genuine reaction.

1112
01:12:40.291 --> 01:12:43.110
That's why they like it.
They want to see genuine stuff.
You know,

1113
01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:53.070
here the worst.
Okay.

1114
01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:58.200
I'm shutting it down and I'm sure they lost all my trust.
Babe.

1115
01:12:58.590 --> 01:13:02.250
That one was an accident.
I didn't mean to do that.
I didn't mean to.

1116
01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:08.580
I'm sorry about that.
So,
but it's over now.
No,
it's not.

1117
01:13:08.581 --> 01:13:12.250
You're lying.
No,
it's over.
It is over.
It is over.
Um,

1118
01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:16.740
you want to see this woman get really excited about eating an ice cream Sundae?

1119
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:21.150
I guess a new Sunday came out.
She got Barf it up.
No,
she doesn't Barf it up,

1120
01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:25.110
but she gets really excited and she's alone and she's just like,
God damn,

1121
01:13:25.111 --> 01:13:29.400
this fucking tastes good.
It's like,
here,
look

1122
01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:34.820
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

1123
01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:51.880
<v 0>it's,
it's a bacon Sundae.</v>

1124
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.010
I like how she matched her shirt to the decor of that restaurant is pretty cool.

1125
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:59.300
You're full on purple.
There's a lot of things going on with her.

1126
01:13:59.450 --> 01:14:04.450
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

1127
01:14:14.610 --> 01:14:17.660
what is happening if we can be honest,

1128
01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:23.520
<v 2>she shouldn't be eating that.
She should not be having the Sunday.</v>

1129
01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:24.450
The Bacon Sundae.

1130
01:14:30.170 --> 01:14:32.250
<v 5>She's retarded.
You don't share dairy?</v>

1131
01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:43.823
<v 2>Wow.</v>

1132
01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:05.670
I mean that's my new favorite.

1133
01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:10.270
I feel like I'm going to appreciate that clip a lot the next time I see it like

1134
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:14.310
I felt like I like it a lot already.
I felt that way before.

1135
01:15:14.370 --> 01:15:17.610
Like you know when you've been alone and you felt that way when you're eating,

1136
01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:21.390
especially with food.
Who was one of those things where sometimes you go like,

1137
01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:24.090
especially if you're alone and just don't want to be like you got to try it,

1138
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:29.110
buy it and I have been several times I've wanted to do the exact same thing.

1139
01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:31.173
You ever want to do this?

1140
01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:32.670
<v 5>If there's buyers,</v>

1141
01:15:41.010 --> 01:15:42.090
this is so cool.

1142
01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:46.740
<v 2>It's La.
That's La for you.</v>

1143
01:15:47.670 --> 01:15:49.490
Thinking about moving to La Jesus.

1144
01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:52.500
That's one of the things you can run into here and in Los Angeles,

1145
01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:17.150
things aren't well for her.
She kind of reminds me a little bit of it.

1146
01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:19.793
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1147
01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:20.933
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1148
01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:22.643
<v 5>Female.</v>

1149
01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:40.290
<v 2>That's so weird.
That was the girl.
Fuck me in my ass,
man.</v>

1150
01:16:40.410 --> 01:16:41.243
<v 5>I love that.</v>

1151
01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:49.410
Which is howling smashing the car.

1152
01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:09.010
<v 2>Can we hear the homeless guy?</v>

1153
01:17:11.490 --> 01:17:12.570
<v 0>That's a good one.
Yeah.</v>

1154
01:17:27.490 --> 01:17:32.490
<v 5>Oh Man.</v>

1155
01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:41.210
Shit,
shit,
Shit.
Shit

1156
01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:43.893
man.

1157
01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:48.490
<v 0>Okay.
I really does it.
And what is the homeless homeless,</v>

1158
01:17:50.150 --> 01:17:53.240
homeless guy gets raped by gay goes.
Yes.
They know.

1159
01:17:53.290 --> 01:17:54.860
They gotta take it down from a lot of places,

1160
01:17:55.730 --> 01:18:00.680
I think both for its title and content.
Yeah.

1161
01:18:00.681 --> 01:18:03.690
Is it because the title was homeless man raped by a gay guy,

1162
01:18:04.210 --> 01:18:09.170
which is a really clever why?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1163
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:11.870
It does a lot of places.
She just so you know,

1164
01:18:11.871 --> 01:18:15.260
the lady we just played is laying on the hood of a car.

1165
01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:17.680
Just ain't fuck you Jesus.
Fuck me.
Jesus.
Yeah.

1166
01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:21.490
And pretending to be fucked and humping the car.
Giving a blow job.

1167
01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:23.990
Yeah.
It's a lot.

1168
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:32.840
Yeah.
It's a lot.
We're just mocking people that need help right now.

1169
01:18:35.070 --> 01:18:40.040
Fuck me.
Yeah,
no,
it's interesting.
Pretty good.

1170
01:18:42.530 --> 01:18:45.050
Um,
is there anything else you need,
Jane?
Anything else?

1171
01:18:45.650 --> 01:18:49.460
I think I got it all and this episode.

That's a big show.

1183
01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.760
You guys should get your tickets.
I Dunno if it's sold out.

1184
01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:36.560
It's sold out in like three minutes.
That's crazy.

1185
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:39.380
But the podcast will be fun to look podcast.
