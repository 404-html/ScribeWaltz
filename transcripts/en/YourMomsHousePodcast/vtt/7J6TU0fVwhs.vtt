<v 3>man.</v>

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.370
Milk is milk is milk is milk is

Acrobatic farts.

8
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.500
Acrobatic farts.
How's that?

9
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.820
Acrobatic farts.
Acrobatic farts.
Acrobatic farts.

10
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.740
Acrobatic farms.
Acrobatic farts.

11
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.850
Acrobatic acrobatics.

12
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.103
<v 4>Oh,</v>

13
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.440
<v 0>I guess it's Vegan then.
Yeah,
I guess you said so.
Yeah.</v>

14
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.460
<v 5>Acrobatic farts.</v>

15
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.050
<v 0>Let's see who,
uh,
who did that?</v>

16
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.700
It's by Chris Spence is called acrobatic farts by Chris Spence.
Oh,

17
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.740
thank you Chris.
Thanks.
Good job jeans.
Good job.
Great jeans.

18
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.023
Um,

19
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.350
<v 5>I didn't tell you this yet,
but I,</v>

20
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.640
I'm editing my special and I went into the office today to do it.
Yeah.

21
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.250
And there's this really cute like 20 something year old girl who works the

22
00:02:03.251 --> 00:02:07.650
reception desk and tits situation.
Like,
oh,
I didn't,
I didn't look at them then.

23
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.960
I don't wanna hear the rest of the story.
She's really sweet.

24
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.750
And every time I come in there,
you know,
she's got like cool pink hair.

25
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.260
Like she's a cool younger girl.
She's not like a dip shit basically.
Right.

26
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.330
And she's not overly enthusiastic or like she's,
she's smart.

27
00:02:22.331 --> 00:02:25.630
You can tell.
Yeah.
So she always takes my id and checks me in.

28
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.070
And as I was checking in today,
um,

29
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.180
like a dad came in and he was signing in and then another dad came in behind her

30
00:02:33.401 --> 00:02:36.790
and was like,
hey bro,
don't let him in.
I don't know.
I don't know who this guy is.

31
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.510
April,
don't let them in.
Don't let him in April,
April,
don't let,

32
00:02:40.511 --> 00:02:42.830
and he kept repeating it and she kept ignoring him.
Yeah.

33
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.000
As did the guy who was signing in because we were like,

34
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.800
we get the joke dad and I,
I felt so bad for her cause I could see it.

35
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.230
She's just like this asshole.
Yeah.
We'll love it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

36
00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.770
It's a good joke.
Yeah.

37
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.360
<v 6>And you know,
she hears it like,
Oh
yeah.</v>

38
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.700
I mean,
poor April's probably heard that

39
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.570
<v 7>thousand 11 men,
I don't know.
This is,
yeah.
Hey,
do you see this guy?</v>

40
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.500
You check them out.
Right.
All right.
And she,
she didn't

41
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.653
<v 6>best part about her.</v>

42
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.000
I love blonde jokes.

43
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.260
<v 7>The best part is that she didn't even feign that.
It was funny.
Oh,</v>

44
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.040
she's so broken by it that she was like,
yeah,
I get it.
Mark.
Or whenever it was,

45
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.950
it was like,
okay,

46
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.440
this is the a 300th day that you've done this.

47
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.480
But that is the plight of being an attractive young female is that Dad boners

48
00:03:42.481 --> 00:03:46.350
are always cracking jokes and trying to get your attention and get you to laugh

49
00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:48.570
at them because their wives hate their guts.

50
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.360
Probably like their children are over them.
So they,

51
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.390
that's why they always like to flirt with waitresses and young.

52
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.260
You know what it is.
I think it is.
I think it is.
It's not about,

53
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.390
it's about a tension.
Yeah.

54
00:04:00.391 --> 00:04:05.220
It's about attention because their wives are like shutting it down.
Yep.
Derives,

55
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.910
you're in menopause.
So anyone's eyes who light up at anything.
Yeah.

56
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.600
Sounds exciting to them.
Cause the no law,
no eyes light up at home.

57
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.850
Nobody finds him funny at home.

58
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.930
Their kids are old enough to know that their sense of humor is one person in the

59
00:04:18.931 --> 00:04:22.140
officer's like,
oh,
like mark,
you know,
like that's funny that he's like,

60
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.240
this is great.
It's a good feeling is great for mark.

61
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.100
No attention,
like nobody cares about him anymore.
It's funny because we've been,

62
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.890
uh,
we spent the weekend together the week together.
You've been home,

63
00:04:34.891 --> 00:04:38.790
it's been great.
And we went on an overnight trip where I would say where we say,

64
00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:43.791
but we want an overnight and we got to see like dad's swimming and mom's walking

65
00:04:43.891 --> 00:04:48.891
around and we noticed there we were in the lobby and there was this poor son of

66
00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:53.550
a bitch wearing a really baggy suit.

67
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.920
And then in white,
new balance.
Right.
And the pants,

68
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.890
first of all,
it was a,
it wasn't a suit,
it was,
it was just trousers and ah,

69
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.200
and a sports coat that,
but they didn't go together.
Oh,
okay.
Match.
Okay.

70
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.470
You know,
helping each other.
They didn't,
sure.
There was no,
you know,
unison.

71
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.670
The colors didn't go together and they were too short.
He had high waters on,

72
00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:21.510
so they were high up
and we,

73
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.830
we were walking towards this guy,
what did I say?
You go,

74
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.570
nobody loves him.
Yeah.
He has no love.
It's going to nobody,
nobody loves him.

75
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.950
I even asked him,
Amanda,
my,
I didn't let him hear it,
but I go to,

76
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.350
does nobody love you because no one,

77
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.620
if somebody loved him they'd be like,
we were at,

78
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.210
we're going to change all of this.
Right.
Well that's the wife's job.

79
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.170
You got to check your spouse.
Even it's the husband's job to check the what lady?

80
00:05:46.171 --> 00:05:49.360
Yeah.
So that you don't go out into the world looking like a dip shit.

81
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.240
He looked like a real dummy.
Yeah.
It wasn't just,
you know,

82
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.650
this isn't just fashion commentary.
He looked broken.
Yeah.

83
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.060
Well just dorky.
Like I'm not saying that I'm a Fashionista by any stretch,

84
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.760
but there are certain rules to the game.

85
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.590
Like you know the white dads sneakers and high waters is definitely not a good

86
00:06:09.591 --> 00:06:10.820
look.
Not a good look.

87
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.040
And we were driving in the car and we saw a lady who totally shut it down

88
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:20.840
crossing the street and she was wearing what looks like those Tiva kind of

89
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:23.810
Birkenstock sandals with no socks.
You know,

90
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:25.640
we're talking about like their real utility Sandal,

91
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:30.020
the Denver Sandal and then a pair of cargo shorts.

92
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.070
And then like really functional looking tank top as well,

93
00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:37.750
like all beige and short,
short hair.
It does,

94
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.500
you know there's a thing you always say is but,

95
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.720
and I think people will probably be like,
oh my God,

96
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.160
are you guys serious about this?

97
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.780
But I think it's true that you don't see as much of that in Europe.

98
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:50.450
I feel like,
oh absolutely not.
Uh,

99
00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:54.650
growing up my mother and my stepmother kept their shit on fleek.
Yeah.
Like,

100
00:06:54.651 --> 00:06:56.390
so what if he had the baby yesterday?

101
00:06:56.391 --> 00:07:00.050
Like your acid going to have your manicure done,
your makeup's going to be on,

102
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.510
you're going to be wearing a nice dress and you're going to be back down to a

103
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:05.510
size six bitch.
Like in Europe.
It is.
I mean,

104
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.530
I think it is unheard of.

105
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.020
We were at the beach today with Lj and I see two little boys playing and the

106
00:07:12.021 --> 00:07:14.960
mother and father,
I just hanging back,
there's no coolers,

107
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:19.130
there's no overwhelming toys.
Umbrellas,
the mother looks skinny,

108
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:24.260
good shape.
And I,
what I say to you,
you said,
well,

109
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.320
I remember when we saw some animal and you said,
I promise I'll never,

110
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.160
I'll never look like that animal for you.
But I,
I said,
those aren't Americans.

111
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.480
I go,
this is definitely not Americans anyway,
way,

112
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.150
there wasn't really a giveaway to that being true.

113
00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:40.700
But then you talk to them and you were right.
Yeah.
The lady I talked to,

114
00:07:40.701 --> 00:07:44.240
they're from Ukraine.
I knew it.
I knew it because you look great.

115
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.470
You're not all panicked that your kids are jumping off the rocks.
You know?
Uh,

116
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.080
there,
there weren't a million toys.
And you know,

117
00:07:51.081 --> 00:07:53.840
Americans love to bring the whole fucking barbecue grill,
uh,

118
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.550
to the beach and the fucking tent and Mexican Americans.
You're saying,
I mean,

119
00:07:58.551 --> 00:08:00.950
like,
I don't know.
I'm not,
I'm not specify,

120
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:06.760
but I do know that growing up my mother kept her shit tight.

121
00:08:06.761 --> 00:08:09.560
Like she still looked good and she dressed like a woman.

122
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.370
And same with my stepmother.
Dress like a woman dressed like a woman,

123
00:08:13.371 --> 00:08:14.900
not like a zero.

124
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:21.080
And I do feel like that is an American woman thing that for some reason

125
00:08:21.081 --> 00:08:25.430
menopause shut up.
Shut it the fuck down.
The hormones shift.

126
00:08:25.431 --> 00:08:28.970
I get it.
I totally get the,
it's hard,
especially when you have a baby,

127
00:08:28.971 --> 00:08:33.290
you don't feel pretty anymore.
I will say to further that point,

128
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.180
I think the men in the,

129
00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:40.181
in those cultures also keep it more together because you see less dad who's just

130
00:08:41.091 --> 00:08:45.890
like completely let it go now that it doesn't exist obviously in those cultures,

131
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:47.980
but you see less of it,
you see less,

132
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.700
you see more effort put into self maintenance,
even basic fashions.

133
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.130
Um,
you know,
I remember in my

134
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.640
<v 0>semester abroad when I lived with this old lady in an all in Madrid,</v>

135
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.750
her son was 20 years older than me would come visit.

136
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:11.550
They do to always looked,
you know,
presentable.
He always looks sharp and he goes,

137
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:15.480
uh,
he told me,
he goes,
you didn't know how we know when an American,

138
00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.060
he's walking down the street,

139
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.680
go know how he goes cause you did this like shit.

140
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.940
<v 7>That's right.
And I was going to be,
right now I'm wearing pajamas.</v>

141
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:31.160
<v 0>Yeah,
he's like d shirts with a big stupid things on them.</v>

142
00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.350
Jordan's.
Sorry.
Yeah,
I was like,
oh yeah.
He's like,

143
00:09:36.351 --> 00:09:39.790
that's how we know they'd say American because he looked like shit.
Yeah,

144
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.720
let me go.
Okay,
thanks man.

145
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.500
<v 7>Now the flip side is that we've earned the right to look like shit cause we're</v>

146
00:09:45.501 --> 00:09:50.390
number one.
You know what I'm saying?
That is though like a result of that.

147
00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.600
It is.
It's like,
you know what?
On the other hand,
that's our culture.

148
00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.210
We don't give a fuck.
Fuck you.
This is my house.

149
00:09:56.211 --> 00:09:59.300
This is what I do is is my Barca lounger.
Fuck you.
And I respect that too.

150
00:09:59.301 --> 00:10:01.430
So I'm on both sides of the fence here.

151
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:05.030
<v 0>I think it's,
I think it's a fair thing to feel both ways actually.</v>

152
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.550
Because there's just times where you feel like,
Hey,

153
00:10:07.551 --> 00:10:11.120
can we just fucking keep it together a little more and then there's times where

154
00:10:11.121 --> 00:10:11.954
you go fuck it.

155
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.940
<v 7>Yeah.
I'm just,
I'm just going to target.
I'm looking like shit today.
You know,</v>

156
00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:20.410
I want my house slippers out a few times in the first year of the FLS is life.

157
00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.450
I think it's all going to do,

158
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:22.760
<v 0>it's kind of a boss move.</v>

159
00:10:22.761 --> 00:10:27.761
I mean you see it a lot in la where the somebody pulls up in $100,000 car but

160
00:10:30.081 --> 00:10:33.140
they were wearing t shirts and shorts and slippers.

161
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.640
That is like a very,
I dunno,
I,
I see that as an American thing,
right?

162
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:43.520
This is a really explicit,
like I'm not going to go out of my way to match that.

163
00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.490
Definitely.
And uh,
specifically west coast thing.

164
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:51.470
You have west coast millionaires that look like Hobos.
Um,
a lot,

165
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:56.120
a lot.
I mean,
yes,
some of the most,
especially in show business,

166
00:10:56.121 --> 00:10:59.160
like they look like fucking Douche bags and they're milling restaurants.

167
00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.650
He runs fucking that studio and you're like,
that guy looks like shit.

168
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.420
It looks like he's falling apart,
man.

169
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.580
<v 7>But I,
I think just generally,
I think,
uh,
I don't know why,
but like,</v>

170
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.430
especially mothers in America,
I think there's this thing of like,
you,

171
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.320
you have children and now you're totally desexualized.

172
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:20.730
Like you're just an asexual.
You got to shut it down.
And it's,

173
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.320
it's sad.
It is sad just because I feel like European women,

174
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.300
there's still a sexuality thereafter.

175
00:11:26.301 --> 00:11:30.950
You have children and shouldn't stop you from fucking like,
it's silly.

176
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:35.620
I'm glad that this is one of your things,
one of your hangups,
right?

177
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:38.980
You're always focused on like,
yeah,
stay fucking well,

178
00:11:38.981 --> 00:11:42.020
you thinking that you're a woman because you're still a person after you have

179
00:11:42.021 --> 00:11:45.420
children.
I don't know why having children makes you or the,

180
00:11:45.421 --> 00:11:49.070
the culture allows you to just like,
well I'll have a kid now.

181
00:11:49.071 --> 00:11:51.570
I got to shut everything down and so Zahra,

182
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.160
still a sexual

183
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.390
<v 0>being.
You still person cause you have a kid.
Yeah.
You're just raising a child.</v>

184
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.580
That's the thing.
It's a myth.
It's a mental shift there.
They're saying,

185
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:01.990
I have a kid,

186
00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:06.940
therefore I have to give fully to this kid and all those other aspects of who I

187
00:12:06.941 --> 00:12:10.540
was or I am.
I have to close up.
But you don't,
you don't have to.

188
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.370
No one doesn't exclude the other.
Right.
You can have a,

189
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:17.470
we can have many identities.
Yeah.
Mommy is just I,
but I think too,

190
00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:20.050
that's the big mommy obsession in this country.
To that.

191
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:24.600
Moms have to be perfect and yeah,
be totally devoted 100% all the time.
Yeah,

192
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.740
it's a lot of pressure.
And if you don't then you're bad.
You're bad.

193
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:33.820
You're a bad mom.
Just cause you licked dad's balls.
I Dunno about that part.

194
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.710
I don't know about that.
Where was it?
Oh I can,

195
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.550
we haven't done a proper show open,
but I want you to talk about my future.

196
00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:44.140
What really got it.
All right.
Let's get this show started.
Officially official,

197
00:12:44.141 --> 00:12:45.880
official [inaudible] we go.
Okay.

198
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.600
<v 8>What I want to get the message out there,</v>

199
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.940
it's okay for them in the park is I'm fighting for a woman's right.

200
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.580
It's don't like a lot of women feel embarrassed.

201
00:12:51.581 --> 00:12:56.440
They don't want a one bed and a guy like Tom,
the type of guy,
you know,

202
00:12:56.441 --> 00:12:57.950
I don't mind like I'm into that stuff.

203
00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:01.750
So I'm trying to get guys like me that the join this booklet because I think we

204
00:13:01.751 --> 00:13:04.210
could really change the world.
Realize that the women,

205
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:05.510
there's water in their basement.

206
00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.870
<v 1>Oh is Randy.
Don't bring anyone loving to live.</v>

207
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:17.350
Well,
welcome to your mom's house with

208
00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:21.493
Christina.

209
00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:05.350
<v 0>I don't know.
Fucking lunatic is,
I didn't know there was a problem with women.</v>

210
00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:09.530
Bob Smith sits around Union Square in New York City filming from the cure.
Oh,

211
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.790
okay.
So he knows Bob is the one that's filming the people,

212
00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:16.840
so he has millions of these.
This duty films in the video is named Roman.

213
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.920
He smells women's parts to fight for women's rights.
By the way,

214
00:14:20.921 --> 00:14:25.180
I think the tie in there that I was thinking was that part of shutting it down

215
00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:29.620
is,
is a result of the of feminism.
In other words,

216
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.160
I think for probably many years it was so unacceptable to shut it down.

217
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:40.590
That part of like backlash backlash was,
I'm going to shut it down.

218
00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.240
I'm not doing that for you.
True.
You know it's true.

219
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:45.380
I do think that there's it and the people,
thank God people like,

220
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.440
like Roman are keeping women's rights,
you know,

221
00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.820
on the table how selfless of him to sniff women's asses in public so that they

222
00:14:52.821 --> 00:14:56.390
feel like they can love.
Favorite thing is when a dude who's just,

223
00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.830
who's just trying to get a nut.
Yeah.
Changes the narrative to that.

224
00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:02.330
It's a bigger thing.
Of course,

225
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:07.630
one of my favorite moves of dudes and only men are capable of spinning that type

226
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:12.140
of nonsense.
Yeah,
like dude,
you just like farts.
Yeah.

227
00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.210
Cause it makes your Dick hard.
You don't feel like,

228
00:15:14.211 --> 00:15:18.350
I don't want to change the world and write the best is a guru.

229
00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:22.860
The guy who like the twin goddess activation.
Oh yeah.
Horse Shit Man guy.

230
00:15:22.861 --> 00:15:25.950
He's just a fucking Douche bags and the Rob Rob Guy,

231
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.020
I mean he's just a guy that likes to jerk his cock and [inaudible]

232
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.440
<v 8>all day.
They play an asshole</v>

233
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.460
and this is better.
I take my time and all Spicer,
I get the snake.

234
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:43.950
The girl gives a sign in his hand.
He just says Fart smeller

235
00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:47.760
<v 0>that he's holding in Union Square,
which is a dad job to where they go.</v>

236
00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:50.880
He's a real fart.
Smeller I mean smart feller here though.
No,

237
00:15:50.881 --> 00:15:52.590
I haven't heard that one.
But that's good.
Yeah.

238
00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:55.360
<v 8>Or they're not actually fighting though.
They're just putting their button,</v>

239
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.200
your face.
They don't have gas.

240
00:15:57.201 --> 00:16:01.680
I could just read them like the established by telling me how far is too far.

241
00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.450
A lot of them aren't really far.

242
00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:10.040
<v 0>A lot of them are really farting.
Cool man.
Yeah,
he's just a perv.</v>

243
00:16:10.041 --> 00:16:14.640
It likes to sniff girl's bed.
Don't let him.
But I mean that's it

244
00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:18.120
<v 8>know you want to be like message out there for a woman's,</v>

245
00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:22.450
they don't what a crusader,

246
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.330
but we should find that song.

247
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.330
So I'm trying to get guys like me that the join this booklet.

248
00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:33.990
I know why he says that the reason that Florida,
their face,

249
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:38.820
<v 0>the reason that he says that is because it's led to it happening so many times.</v>

250
00:16:38.821 --> 00:16:40.500
In other words,
he's,

251
00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:44.340
he's asked women kind of where you farmed my face and a lot of,
you know,

252
00:16:44.341 --> 00:16:45.840
sometimes it's happened,
sometimes it's not.

253
00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:49.110
But when he changes the narrative to empowerment,
I'm in PA,

254
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:50.430
I believe in women's rights.

255
00:16:50.431 --> 00:16:54.870
I think it's ridiculous that then every once in a while somebody is like,
okay,

256
00:16:54.871 --> 00:16:58.290
like he hoses them into that.
So now it's automated in his head.

257
00:16:58.291 --> 00:16:59.560
Like that's what I got to say,
right.

258
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.580
It's positive spin on a very negative weird thing,

259
00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.890
which I mean I congratulate him for finding that,

260
00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.950
but it is nonsense that it's women's rights really.

261
00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.350
<v 8>Women's rights thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's probably</v>

262
00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:18.160
make us more like my hands and was like get rid of civilization a civilization

263
00:17:18.161 --> 00:17:20.740
and capitalism is a problem.
Like if we are parties,

264
00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:24.810
other spaces and we get rid of the stock market back into animals.

265
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:28.120
Well wait a guy to worry about all this crap.
It's called.
We share everything.

266
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.140
We in college,
so this was like,

267
00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:35.080
<v 0>yeah,
antique.
Now it's anticapitalist.
So as he's really going out there,</v>

268
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.220
it's got a bigger scope.
Tom Making a change.

269
00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.280
Why don't you give him some credit for having that's very close minded of me to

270
00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:46.160
see it that way.
Do you think he has a girlfriend?
Like what's the life like?

271
00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.990
What's his personal life?

272
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:52.020
What I am so curious about these lunatics like what do you think is happening?

273
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:55.650
He's got it probably could have a much more fulfilling life if he wasn't so hung

274
00:17:55.651 --> 00:17:58.980
up on those farts all the time.
I think it's probably,

275
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:01.770
I think it's a big distraction for him.
It's probably

276
00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:06.210
a lot of his thoughts and planning and days are just in,

277
00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:09.150
you know when his parents are like,
what'd you do this weekend?

278
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.450
He has to come up with a whole other story cause he's like,

279
00:18:12.451 --> 00:18:16.170
I spent Friday planning this thing and then Saturday I,

280
00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:20.490
I got to the park at at 8:00 AM and I redid my sign.

281
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:25.350
It wasn't right and then,
and then I spent about six hours.

282
00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.630
So you're saying that it's kind of an obsessive thing with him?
I think so.

283
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.900
Taking over his life at this point.
I think you're right.

284
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:36.350
I think this guy should just hire someone to,
I think it's so,

285
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.780
he probably gets so much more done if he would just like find a woman.

286
00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.080
If it's not a woman that he could date,
then just be like,
Hey,

287
00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:47.340
do you think you could spend like a few hours just farting in?
Like I'll pay you.

288
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.530
You know what I mean?
Then he doesn't have money.
That's the problem.

289
00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.890
Doesn't have money.
He doesn't have a job.
He's got another job.

290
00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:55.530
Tell the fart smelling thing,
which a lot,

291
00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.600
it's a movement and he's creating a movement baby.

292
00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:02.010
But I think if he would get a job and it just hire his fart lady,

293
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.910
see that would be better.
You just get more done in life,

294
00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.570
you know it is more productive.
Got To get some things done dude.

295
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:13.220
There's a lot of lady that likes like,
they like to Fart late.

296
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.730
We found their videos ranked well actually in this day and age maybe cause it

297
00:19:17.731 --> 00:19:21.330
looked old kind of whoa.
It looks kind of old.

298
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.830
I would think that with the right amount of ads,
which is computer,

299
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:30.720
you know,
website ad going on,
meet people that he could,

300
00:19:30.721 --> 00:19:34.620
especially like some fetish connect thing.
He could probably find someone.

301
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:38.520
I mean do you like the farm?
I like to smell him.
Sure.

302
00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.150
He seemed Nice enough that I'm sure somebody would like him.

303
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.880
You know he's somebody,
he's tight.
You could have,

304
00:19:44.881 --> 00:19:47.850
you could have dinner with that guy.
He's,
he,
he was a social,

305
00:19:47.851 --> 00:19:49.560
now I'm not saying you,

306
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:53.420
I'm saying that like he's not so weird that you go,
look,

307
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:57.390
that guy's just fucking straight up.
Psycho is obsession now.
He,
he,

308
00:19:57.391 --> 00:20:01.530
he's placing all of his eggs in this fart basket emotionally.
You know,

309
00:20:01.531 --> 00:20:03.180
speaking of that,
you know,
it hasn't happened in a while.

310
00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:05.440
We haven't gotten the main farther on the shot.

311
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:08.370
Let's give top dog recall.

312
00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:14.290
<v 9>Top Dog Kate,
buddy.
Stop.
Talk,</v>

313
00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.990
take buddy.
It was top dog.

314
00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:23.300
You need to wipe down.
She stopped talking.

315
00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:27.430
<v 0>Yeah.
So let's see here.
Um,
yeah.</v>

316
00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:31.060
So on our trip,
on her overnight mommy trip,
we just took,

317
00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:35.170
we heard a brand new dad joke from radio that I did radio.

318
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.370
It was like on,

319
00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:41.520
I called in to like choppy chopper and the road dog love,

320
00:20:42.101 --> 00:20:44.140
by the way,
that when I called it the radio,

321
00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.660
they'll sometimes right before they'll tell you is in the room.

322
00:20:46.661 --> 00:20:50.470
So there'll be hey,
um,
it's a,
it's a man and Mike,
just so you know,

323
00:20:50.471 --> 00:20:53.470
you're on the phone with and you're like,
oh,
okay.
And this time they were like,

324
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:57.310
hey,
it's a,
it's a gym,
the ranger and Laura like,

325
00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.690
sure.
Like it's a carrot.
I don't know who these people are,

326
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.380
but I mean also just to that you're going to be like,
can I talk to the ranger?

327
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.740
Right,
right,
right.
Like,
you know what I mean,

328
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.300
you're going to talk to the dog and the blood.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And you're like,

329
00:21:10.301 --> 00:21:13.390
I'm not going to ask for Hound dog.
I'm not doing that.
And Yeah.
So anyways,

330
00:21:13.391 --> 00:21:16.060
we were talking about you.
Yeah.
And it got like,

331
00:21:16.061 --> 00:21:20.020
I realize it's just had a serious tone.
I was like,
you know,

332
00:21:20.021 --> 00:21:23.710
we've been together and Blah,
blah blah.
And then I can tell that there's just,

333
00:21:23.711 --> 00:21:27.070
they're just kind of waiting like,
what was this serious?
And then I go,

334
00:21:27.071 --> 00:21:30.540
but she's got a couple of,
you know,
big old hangars owner and that's grand.

335
00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:33.430
They're like,
oh,
that's awesome man.
All right.
Yeah.
Should I go?

336
00:21:33.431 --> 00:21:36.970
She's got two big sloppers on her and he's like,
I love this guy.

337
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.770
And it was Laura here.
She's got a couple of state troopers on it.
Correct.

338
00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:46.040
<v 7>Which I actually think is very funny about those funny two troopers.</v>

339
00:21:46.041 --> 00:21:48.290
I've never heard that before.
I was pretty great.

340
00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:52.100
That is such a great new dad joke.
I think that's really funny.

341
00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.750
We have to run by top down.
Of course we had to get his stamp of approval on it.

342
00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:00.660
Let's see,
a couple of state troopers.
Let's do,

343
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:03.770
how should we tell it?
You tell them that somebody said it or yeah,

344
00:22:03.771 --> 00:22:05.800
he calls his wife's Ted State.
Drippers yeah.

345
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:10.870
<v 10>Couple of Slope Dad.
Hey Buddy.
How you doing?
Good.
It's been awhile.</v>

346
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:15.930
Good.
Yeah.
How are you man?
I'm doing good.
You know,

347
00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:20.780
working half days.
It's nice.
That's nice.
Yeah.
Yeah,
it is.

348
00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.830
<v 0>You know,
one of my buddies has a funny reference,</v>

349
00:22:23.831 --> 00:22:28.670
I don't know if you've heard this before,
but he calls his wife's boobs,
uh,

350
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:30.100
state droppers.

351
00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:33.050
<v 10>Call her what</v>

352
00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:36.600
<v 0>he calls her boobs state droppers.</v>

353
00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.750
<v 10>Oh my God.
I can't believe.
Oh,</v>

354
00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:46.200
it's not what I call a loving comment.
Yeah,

355
00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.980
it's pretty funny.
Yeah.
Super Women.
You know,

356
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:56.300
they got to where they don't make bulletproof.

357
00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.330
And what books do they not know?

358
00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:03.000
What did I do?
I mean,
all right.

359
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:07.830
Are you well versed in the bulletproof vest market?
I asked one of them,

360
00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.550
I asked one of my a and R my secretary.
You Sir?

361
00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:17.480
Awesome.
To Cop.
Yeah.
Okay.
Can I address it?

362
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:22.000
They have a special model for women and she says,
I don't think so.
Oh,

363
00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:27.330
all right.
Very well written.
Oh,
by the way,
an accurate,
yeah.

364
00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.830
<v 0>Uh,
so there's been a lot of excitement,</v>

365
00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:35.760
anticipation about what's going to happen with fart mistress.com the website

366
00:23:36.821 --> 00:23:39.880
that I bought and yeah.
And uh,

367
00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:44.710
and whether or not mom is going to fart on it.
And you know,

368
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:48.920
at first I was going to try to raise money,

369
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:54.620
but now I think what I'm going to do is just pay her myself.

370
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:58.130
But she was saying that she felt like a prostitute,
but I mean,

371
00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:01.160
she don't have to get naked or anything.
You just fart.
What's the big deal?

372
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:05.900
<v 10>You know,
I really don't understand.
I,
I mean,
uh,</v>

373
00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:09.970
the other day I,
I did I that tell you about that.
That shit I did the other day.

374
00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:14.330
Oh God,
no,
no.
Oh,
it happened.
So,
I'm not a row,

375
00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.690
I'm on a road trip up there.
See?
And Jane,

376
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:22.300
and what always happens when you go on a road trip is to get up in the morning.

377
00:24:22.301 --> 00:24:26.650
You hit the road and I'm on the highway.
Yeah.
And if I do that,

378
00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:32.230
you know,
my eight 15 bombs away time is,
doesn't happen.

379
00:24:32.231 --> 00:24:34.410
So I went a whole day without a single shit.

380
00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.830
<v 0>Oh No.
Yeah,
that's really bad.</v>

381
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:40.720
<v 10>Well,
I knew what was going to happen the next day.</v>

382
00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:45.070
I know it was going to be ugly.
So woke up,
you know,

383
00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:50.970
I'm home back to my normal routine county did a kind of a kind of a smaller one

384
00:24:52.241 --> 00:24:55.600
probably because I don't know what that big,

385
00:24:55.601 --> 00:24:59.120
and then driving to the gate of the,
uh,

386
00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:03.880
where we live and all of a sudden I feel it coming and I know that feeling.

387
00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:05.880
And I said,
Oh my God,
am I gonna make it?

388
00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.890
<v 0>So you were on your way in or out?</v>

389
00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.110
<v 10>I don't know.
He entered the subdivision.
Okay.
Yeah.
So,
yeah,</v>

390
00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:16.830
headed down there and then you know,
you know that feeling when you have to go,

391
00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.310
you have to kind of squeeze your cheeks together.

392
00:25:20.311 --> 00:25:21.750
You have to stretch your legs out.

393
00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.650
<v 0>Yeah.
How far are you from the house as you're feeling this?</v>

394
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:30.880
<v 10>Oh,
I'm,
I'm,
you know,
quarter mile.</v>

395
00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:35.410
Okay.
So I'll make a lefthand turn down our street,
pull in the driveway,

396
00:25:35.411 --> 00:25:38.010
but then I got to get out of the car,
you know,
the,
the,

397
00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.550
I got to keep my teeth together.
Yes.

398
00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.750
I'm getting out of the car and the whole idea is,
you know,

399
00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:46.540
to try to run in there

400
00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:52.090
and make that right turn.
And when I made that right turn,

401
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:57.190
uh,
you know,
some of it just slipped out what

402
00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:03.100
some of the shed came,
came out and I didn't want to got down the toilet.

403
00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:06.160
Oh yeah.
You know,
it was really messy.
You know,

404
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:12.640
I had some,
in fact it was so messy that I had to wipe,

405
00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:17.560
I know normally do this,
but I had some on my left cheek.
I had to,
you know,
white,

406
00:26:17.561 --> 00:26:20.370
my left cheek with my left hand.
I mean,
you know.

407
00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:25.560
<v 0>Wow,
that's an
unorthodox.
It feels different,
right?</v>

408
00:26:25.561 --> 00:26:26.394
To use your,

409
00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.340
<v 10>well it does.
It's very unorthodox.
And then,</v>

410
00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:33.390
then I looked down to my underwear and I can see some shit to basically,

411
00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:37.350
I had a few,
you know,
niblets in my underwear.

412
00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:42.810
Then I looked inside my trousers and some of it fell into inside my,

413
00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.810
<v 0>so do you throw that stuff away?
What do you do with that?</v>

414
00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.840
<v 10>Oh,
oh no,
no,
I just</v>

415
00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:51.620
rent it off in the,
uh,

416
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:56.140
in the Andrea when you just rent it often and you know,

417
00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.553
why would you,

418
00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:59.540
<v 0>why wouldn't you just throw the underwear out?</v>

419
00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:04.340
<v 10>Well,
why should we,
it's perfectly good.
Unaware.
Not Anymore.
It's not,</v>

420
00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:08.650
it's covered in shit.
Listen,
listen,
I,
I,

421
00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.270
I know a lot about,
you know,

422
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:15.980
sunset and your pants kind of stuff and thanks a lot more of that too.

423
00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:17.540
We on a good pair of underwear.

424
00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.690
<v 0>What does it mean?
What would it take to ruin a good pair of underwear?</v>

425
00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.320
<v 10>Mostly one of the elastic gets worn out.</v>

426
00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:30.580
<v 0>I mean,
so if you had like a full,
if you've got a full shit in your pants,</v>

427
00:27:30.581 --> 00:27:31.480
you'd still keep them.

428
00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:32.860
<v 4>Okay.</v>

429
00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:33.651
<v 10>Yeah.
I mean I,</v>

430
00:27:33.651 --> 00:27:38.651
I what I do is take a shit and put it in the toilet and rents the rest of it and

431
00:27:38.921 --> 00:27:43.330
they handle all
this and that be,

432
00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.480
and then you know,
you're just recycle.
So listen,

433
00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:50.470
good underwear away.

434
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:53.920
<v 0>That's not good anymore.
That's the whole point.</v>

435
00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:58.490
<v 10>Well it is good once you want you to put it in washing machine and hot water and</v>

436
00:27:58.491 --> 00:28:02.580
soap and it comes out nice and white or blue,
whatever color.
Yeah.

437
00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.353
<v 0>Right.</v>

438
00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:05.420
<v 10>Another episode.</v>

439
00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.460
<v 0>No,
you should just try to tell you</v>

440
00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:12.790
<v 10>the,
the,
the,
the,
the issue here really for me was I have to,</v>

441
00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:14.320
when I,
when I really got to go,

442
00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:18.910
I got to work on making those turns into the bathroom or you got to work on
that.

443
00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:20.140
Yeah.

444
00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:24.970
Cause I made that turn and of course means you put your legs and when you make

445
00:28:24.971 --> 00:28:29.680
that turn,
that's when my
turn,
are you talking about though?

446
00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:35.460
Going from in the house to the bathroom.
So through the laundry room.
Yeah,

447
00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:38.770
there was a laundry.
I'm going,
I gotta turn rights.
Closest bathroom,
you know,

448
00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:43.840
is a guest bathroom shower after that?
Oh yeah,

449
00:28:43.841 --> 00:28:48.340
of course.
Yeah.
After.
Yeah.
After.
Yeah,
it was,
I had to,
it was such a mess.

450
00:28:48.341 --> 00:28:50.130
I had jumped in the shower.
And

451
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:54.900
<v 0>what's up with the,
uh,</v>

452
00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:58.140
I'm just changing the topic because I'm about to puke in my mouth,

453
00:28:58.141 --> 00:29:02.530
but what do you,
are you into those new Bra,
new bras mom?
Got,

454
00:29:02.531 --> 00:29:05.760
or are you still digging those?
Are you not mean you're not liking those anymore?

455
00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:07.470
<v 4>Okay.</v>

456
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:10.840
<v 10>Well,
I'm a lace ma'am.
Okay.
Yeah,</v>

457
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.690
I always like to see through,
you know,
give a little little

458
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:19.470
see through there and see that Nepal's and other things.

459
00:29:19.471 --> 00:29:21.760
I'm always been a lace guy and you know,

460
00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:26.220
these functional lift bras with,
if there had been my,

461
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.150
my favorites,
but you know,
I'm not going to tell her that.

462
00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.170
<v 0>Is she wearing,
what is she wearing now?
The functional ones.</v>

463
00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:34.650
<v 10>Oh yeah,
she,
she's all functional night.</v>

464
00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:38.250
<v 0>Yeah.
But why don't you just get her some lace ones?
Yeah.
Just she'll wear,
but</v>

465
00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:42.850
<v 10>she doesn't want,
she did,
but she likes to functional.
Um,
yeah,</v>

466
00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:44.383
know.
So

467
00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.730
<v 0>I was telling,
uh,</v>

468
00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:51.250
I was telling Christina about this girl I went out with in college once,

469
00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:52.400
who,

470
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:57.400
she had such a full Bush that it looked like she had a pair of balls when she,

471
00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:01.910
when she had her panties on,
it was like too much.

472
00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:06.610
<v 10>Well,
you know,
my generation,
it was all about the bush.
Oh,</v>

473
00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:10.840
my generation.
The girl never shaved.

474
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:17.870
And you would classify women by nationality,
whether they had big Bush,

475
00:30:17.871 --> 00:30:21.400
a little Bush.
Oh really?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

476
00:30:21.401 --> 00:30:25.810
So basically you're Italian,
you're Greek.
You know,

477
00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:30.460
Julie at black,
black bushes,

478
00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.230
Scandinavians,
you're,
you know,

479
00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:40.450
uh,
the head,
you know,
grade level and what and,
and,

480
00:30:40.451 --> 00:30:42.490
and the Irish to death,
the English,

481
00:30:42.491 --> 00:30:44.590
you never knew what you were going to get with that.
I mean,

482
00:30:44.591 --> 00:30:49.240
it was all over the map,
but the big ones right there,

483
00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:52.450
the big,
the big black bushes where there,
you know,

484
00:30:52.451 --> 00:30:55.900
that kind of lower European Mediterranean.

485
00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.410
<v 0>Well,
that's what this girl was.
She was a Portuguese.</v>

486
00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.240
<v 10>Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
I can,
I can imagine.
Yeah.</v>

487
00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:07.230
<v 0>I mean,
I saw those panties and I go,
I'm about to hook up with a guy right now.</v>

488
00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:10.910
<v 10>Well,
I'll tell you,
some of those girls in those days,</v>

489
00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:14.560
they did partial shaves because,
you know,
they,
they would,

490
00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:19.930
it would almost be like he a,
uh,
like a reverse triangle,
you know,

491
00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.700
would kind of,
the hair would kind of go up towards,
enables the girls would,

492
00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:24.500
would shave themselves.
Parsons.

493
00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:28.780
<v 0>Oh,
like from below the navel because it would grow and we grow up so high.</v>

494
00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:31.320
<v 10>Oh yeah.
You couldn't wear a bikini otherwise.</v>

495
00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:32.660
<v 0>Oh,
I see.
Yeah.</v>

496
00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.750
<v 10>Yeah.
That's very common in our generation.</v>

497
00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:40.980
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
This girl had a lot of hair,
a small penis,
but a lot of hair.</v>

498
00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.660
<v 10>She had a small penis,
but a lot of hair.</v>

499
00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:54.400
I'm so thrilled.
Yeah.

500
00:31:56.250 --> 00:32:00.650
Yeah.
But I haven't had an accident like that time in a long time.

501
00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.630
<v 0>Uh,
uh,
I feel like,</v>

502
00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:07.500
I feel like it's happened a few times in the last year though.

503
00:32:07.501 --> 00:32:08.770
I feel like it's not that.
Yeah,

504
00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:13.330
<v 10>it's all,
do you know the,
it's all due to when I travel on the car,</v>

505
00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:16.790
what happens is,
you know,
when you get up,
you're,
you're,

506
00:32:16.791 --> 00:32:20.960
you're not in your routine.
You eat differently in the morning coffee,

507
00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:22.150
you know,

508
00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:27.150
you're on the road and then for some reason it just stays there in your rectum.

509
00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:32.590
<v 0>I know I have a lot of travel day problems,
you know,</v>

510
00:32:32.591 --> 00:32:33.600
travel day affects,

511
00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.290
<v 10>I don't know how you'd do it,
quite frankly.
I mean,
you know,
I don't know.</v>

512
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.513
I'm getting,

513
00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:39.980
<v 0>I'm getting teeth whitened,</v>

514
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.390
<v 7>uh,
the week after next.
Um,
you want me to set you guys up?</v>

515
00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:45.363
<v 10>You're out here.</v>

516
00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:51.250
Your mother would want me to get my teeth whitened.
Yeah.
Are you opposed to that?

517
00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:56.770
No,
I'm not.
I just don't want it to be so white,
but it makes me look like,

518
00:32:57.190 --> 00:33:01.090
you know,
I'm kind of Christmas decoration.
Oh,
I hope it does.

519
00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:02.493
I'm going to take,

520
00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:07.270
that's going to be my gift to you if you come out in the next few months.
Yeah.

521
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:10.870
We're,
we're working on that Thanksgiving thing.
Okay.
So,
okay.
All right.

522
00:33:10.871 --> 00:33:14.620
That'd be great.
All right.
Look,
I gotta run.
I love you.
Let me talk to you later.

523
00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.120
Okay,
bye bye.

524
00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:20.540
<v 11>And that was pretty much amazing.</v>

525
00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:26.170
<v 7>I didn't know about the lacy Bra that he likes to see that sample and we would</v>

526
00:33:27.081 --> 00:33:30.260
classify him.
Still crushes.
Okay.

527
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:32.240
That is so gross.

528
00:33:32.241 --> 00:33:35.480
How does it feel to know your dad's sexuality and his sexual preference?

529
00:33:35.481 --> 00:33:38.270
And more than I need.
It's more than 98.

530
00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:42.510
Do you feel like you want to marry your dad?
No.

531
00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:46.340
So Gross,
right?
Yeah.
How come?

532
00:33:46.341 --> 00:33:50.000
It's never okay to know your parents sexual stuff even when you're like a 40

533
00:33:50.001 --> 00:33:53.450
year old grown ass man.
I Dunno.
Never want to know.
Want to hear about it.

534
00:33:53.451 --> 00:33:55.200
What gives your dad a heart on?
No,

535
00:33:56.210 --> 00:34:00.980
he gets more comfortable with it with age cause we'll be hanging out like a bad

536
00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:05.470
Shayne's gun.
She didn't take care of you.
All right.
And the SAC.

537
00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:08.930
Okay.
Her over there?
Uh,
yeah,

538
00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:13.840
that she would capitalist state troopers.
Okay.
Okay.

539
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:14.980
All right.

540
00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:17.480
Well you have to remind him about that when he's out here so that he starts

541
00:34:17.481 --> 00:34:20.270
saying it more.
I feel like he could really adapt that.

542
00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:23.450
He would love to introduce that to his friends.
That's what I'm saying.

543
00:34:23.451 --> 00:34:27.050
You just need some reminders.
We need to drill him on it and then hell yeah,

544
00:34:27.051 --> 00:34:29.090
he'll take it back to Florida.
You know,

545
00:34:29.091 --> 00:34:33.290
we made love recently and it was great,

546
00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.780
but I was thinking there's always room to improve,

547
00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:41.650
<v 11>so we're going to talk about one of the scariest parts of that initial dating</v>

548
00:34:41.841 --> 00:34:44.840
experience and that's the first kiss.

549
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:47.720
We're going to talk a little bit about the first guest and then we're going to

550
00:34:47.721 --> 00:34:49.750
talk a little bit about some of the advanced kissing.

551
00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:52.240
<v 7>Is this real?
This is real.</v>

552
00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.770
<v 11>This is really one of the things that's really cool about kissing.</v>

553
00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:00.780
We always have learned to kiss when we're both giving and receiving at the same

554
00:35:00.781 --> 00:35:01.614
time,

555
00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:07.360
but actually an amazing way to kiss is just to give or just to receipt.

556
00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.753
No,
boy,

557
00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.380
<v 7>that's true.
What do you think?</v>

558
00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:16.050
<v 11>That's Joanna
and she's just going to receive my kiss.</v>

559
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.023
Just start there.

560
00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:25.110
I hate watching people kiss.
She's not kissing back.
Yes.
So,

561
00:35:25.111 --> 00:35:30.111
and she's feeling all of my energy that we talked about in the touch exercise

562
00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:34.000
and the sensation of the sophos.
My Lips against her.
How was

563
00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:36.683
great.

564
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.830
<v 7>He looks like such a fucking dad.
Total boner.</v>

565
00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.310
But this is not what's called being a bad kisser.

566
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:47.850
When you're just limp and you don't respond well,
they're advanced.

567
00:35:47.851 --> 00:35:52.500
So maybe not their intimacy experts and feel like she's making out with her a

568
00:35:52.501 --> 00:35:55.260
golf coach or something.
He's super lame.
Did

569
00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:00.870
well he can't,
he's not cool at net.
Neither a she,
but like,

570
00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:05.550
he's super boners like he's not even,
he's not even trying.
I can gave up.

571
00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:07.943
<v 0>Huh?</v>

572
00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:13.320
<v 7>I Dunno.
He just seems like such a fucking manager of the,
of the,</v>

573
00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:18.380
you know the Gla sunglasses shot.
Yeah.
Such a four corners team,
but

574
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:21.570
<v 11>all right,
so there's a lot of things you can do.</v>

575
00:36:21.571 --> 00:36:23.320
You have a whole playground around lips.

576
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:27.480
You have the outer part of the limps you have in it.
This is real.

577
00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:32.400
You have upper lip,
lower lip,
which feel entirely different.
Yeah,
absolutely.

578
00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:35.460
<v 7>How you know that you fucking nerd.
Yeah.
You dorks,</v>

579
00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:40.330
<v 11>you can use your lips to kiss.
You can use the one throw up.
Sure.</v>

580
00:36:40.331 --> 00:36:41.210
Tony to kissing.

581
00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:45.390
You can do all this just on the outer lips before we even go inside.

582
00:36:45.391 --> 00:36:49.590
She can just slick your banner on.
There you go.

583
00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.190
I got to say,
I got a ponytail guy right here.

584
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:59.550
<v 0>How was that?
That was good.</v>

585
00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:04.380
I got uncomfortable watching that scene in billions when they,

586
00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:07.170
when uh,
when they show

587
00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:12.660
<v 7>perceived real fucking show or movie time loves to do that.
By the way,
Jesus,</v>

588
00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:16.810
showtime will always open on an uncomfortable sexing.
Yeah,
but that guy,

589
00:37:16.811 --> 00:37:20.170
the star of billions has a weird mouth.
He does.
He was a,

590
00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:23.440
he played agent Brody,
Brody Stevens,
Steven,
Bertie,
Siemens,

591
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:28.360
even Brody Stevens from homeland.
He played the red haired guy that Claire Danes,

592
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:29.730
you know,
subway,
whatever.

593
00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:34.160
But his mouth is just so hard there a name for that to get over.

594
00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:35.650
I called Bert mouth or something

595
00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:41.170
<v 0>where they have like the shape of the teeth is weird.
Burt mouth.
Yeah.
You know,</v>

596
00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:46.050
who else has a mouth like that?
Um,
Bill Walton,
you know that it is.

597
00:37:46.051 --> 00:37:47.720
And of course you don't look at this.

598
00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:52.550
<v 7>You have so much disdain for my lack of sports knowledge.
No.
Yeah.</v>

599
00:37:52.551 --> 00:37:56.480
But I don't care about sports.
Why would I know this guy is such a door,

600
00:37:56.481 --> 00:38:00.620
he doesn't get laid at all.
Who's doing the intimacy expert?

601
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:06.050
Let's see here.
Why would you pay money for these two doors to do it?
Whoa.

602
00:38:06.051 --> 00:38:10.490
Look at those teeth,
but see how the chompers or unusually large,

603
00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:14.930
the shape,
the shape is kind of similar.
Yeah.
Not Good.

604
00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:18.650
Oh my God.
Yeah,
but I'm saying his lips,

605
00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:24.140
Adrian Brody Stevens lips is weird.
Oh God.
The teeth are all wrong.

606
00:38:24.141 --> 00:38:26.470
And there were all fake.
So he should have had them done smaller.

607
00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:31.090
<v 0>Yeah,
but he's always had that.
I mean,
that's the shape of his mouth.
You know,</v>

608
00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:34.240
he has that,
what's that guy's name?

609
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:39.700
<v 7>They have the same mouth.
No.
Yeah,
it's similar,</v>

610
00:38:39.701 --> 00:38:41.350
but his lips are not

611
00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:47.110
where the teeth start to go back is sooner.
So in other words,

612
00:38:47.111 --> 00:38:50.560
the mouth goes is more in the teeth are more narrow than wide.
Okay.

613
00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:54.330
Look up per agent.
Brody.
Ancient.
Okay.
Look at billions.
Yeah.

614
00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:57.700
Just Google billions to star and so people know what we're talking about.

615
00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:02.290
But his lips are weird.
I'm just saying the shape of his without his mouth open.

616
00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:07.180
Even I,
the lips really put me off.
Yeah.
Plus he's a,
he's a red hair guy.

617
00:39:07.181 --> 00:39:09.610
It's not my,
it's not my lane.
Damian Lewis,

618
00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:16.030
he's a great actor.
He's,
I think New Zealand or Kiwi or bread or whatever.

619
00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.970
Does he not know or Australian or mom's Chilean.

620
00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.640
He does the American accent flawlessly as English.

621
00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:27.300
He can't even tell the guys English.
Yeah.
Yup.
Yeah.
Cause she,

622
00:39:27.301 --> 00:39:30.250
he and the wife were fucking in their pool,
which by the way,

623
00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:34.240
I don't know who has sex in a pool because all the water goes up your vision and

624
00:39:34.241 --> 00:39:38.710
it's so uncomfortable.
It's bullshit.
Yeah.
His mouth looks super weird,

625
00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:43.210
but it looks weird or when it's closed as lip,
sir.
Yeah.
See,
see the shape of it.

626
00:39:43.211 --> 00:39:48.211
It's like he's such a great actor and his mouth always bothered me in homeland.

627
00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.860
It's probably bothered him a lot too.
Yeah.
But he's like,
he's gotten,

628
00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:58.240
I mean for having a weird mouth.
Yeah.
He's a really confident,
weird mouth guy.

629
00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:01.940
See how he was talking about they go back.
Yup.

630
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:06.760
As opposed to wide,
right?
Yeah.
So the,
and that's what Bill Walton has.

631
00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.980
So you're saying they got it.
It's like a,

632
00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:13.840
it's like a smiley shape or something on teeth.
Yeah.
So Weird,
Huh?

633
00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:19.110
Yeah.
It's like it's,
that's what's what it is.
No,
I know those are,

634
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:22.300
but the teeth,
they also went way too big on those veneers,
man.

635
00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:26.320
You gotta be careful with those veneers.
Those are huge.
There's donkey.
Yeah.

636
00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.580
By the way,
what if we get my dad to get really,
really,

637
00:40:30.581 --> 00:40:35.581
really white tea and veneers to like super white donkey when you're so fucking

638
00:40:36.581 --> 00:40:37.490
hard.
Yeah.

639
00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:46.570
Well I'm just thinking when's the last time your dad went to the dentist all oh

640
00:40:46.571 --> 00:40:49.480
yeah,
I know.
We will.
We could ask that.
And it's been a while.

641
00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:53.560
It has been awhile cause your sisters are always so mean to him about his
breath.

642
00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:57.400
I was like,
God,
your breath.
And they shove like gum in his mouth all the time.

643
00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:04.060
Oh yeah,
your Dad's got the worst dad mouth.
Total dad mouth.

644
00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:07.780
Yeah,
he's got total total fucking dad mouth.

645
00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:12.550
Is it that the dads just don't brush their teeth at all?
Is that what happens?

646
00:41:12.551 --> 00:41:13.540
Or just being old.

647
00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.190
<v 11>Alright,
so there's a lot,
a lot of things you can do.</v>

648
00:41:16.191 --> 00:41:20.600
You have a whole playground around.
You have outer part of the lips,

649
00:41:20.601 --> 00:41:24.020
you have inner part of the lips,
upper lip and the women,

650
00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.270
which feel entirely different apps.

651
00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:30.050
I'm gonna throw up that these tools are fucks to kiss.

652
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:34.580
You can use one that we're doing is we're kissing with their eyes open,

653
00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:40.090
that maintain energy and there's a connection of our hearts.

654
00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.910
There's the connection of our lips,
there's the connection of our eye.
Here's why.

655
00:41:43.911 --> 00:41:45.920
That's his bullshit.
We just dance.

656
00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:50.740
<v 7>Your eyes open is also how someone who has never kissed before cause then</v>

657
00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.770
they're trying to say this is an advanced.
If you,

658
00:41:53.771 --> 00:41:55.840
if you have two eighth graders make out,

659
00:41:55.841 --> 00:42:00.160
they're going to go like [inaudible] and one of them is going to be like close

660
00:42:00.161 --> 00:42:01.660
your fucking eyes.
Weird.

661
00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:08.290
Basically what they're giving you is like rookie kissy moves and they're saying

662
00:42:08.291 --> 00:42:12.160
that it's advanced.
It's not advanced,
not advanced.
This is fucking,
you're right.

663
00:42:12.161 --> 00:42:12.994
It's like,
yeah,

664
00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:18.070
<v 11>new and you're kissing and using your breath.
Knowing that can happen.</v>

665
00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:20.280
We can actually even knew about it.

666
00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:25.080
It is weird to watch people do

667
00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:31.600
<v 7>got it.
If someone did that to me,
I would vomit if someone,</v>

668
00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:35.170
and that's the thing is that I would laugh.
Yeah,
it's intentionally trying.

669
00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:39.880
It's trying hard to be sexy.
Like I was watching the show Gypsy on Netflix,

670
00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.270
two guns say guides again.
Donald's a mirror.

671
00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:45.670
It's not about them though.

672
00:42:45.671 --> 00:42:49.900
Just see now and Naomi Watts is making out with this girl,

673
00:42:49.901 --> 00:42:54.190
this younger girl,
and she goes,
I want you to dance for me.

674
00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:58.780
And the girl does it and it's so corny.
And we were just,

675
00:42:58.781 --> 00:43:01.840
we're making fun of it last night.
And I was like,
Tom,
I want you to dance for me.

676
00:43:01.841 --> 00:43:05.620
Like who does that?
Like who can do it with a serious face?

677
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:06.940
People that aren't assholes.

678
00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:12.580
That's the thing is we're too jaded to do.
Is that right?
Yes,
of course.

679
00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:16.890
But I feel like that will be taking myself way too seriously by the way.

680
00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:20.720
Told you about the tongue lead kisser.
Yeah.
I'm like,

681
00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:22.850
they're telling you to do that.
These dorks.

682
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:26.580
<v 0>It was terrible.
I thought that was some juvenile shit.
This is like a,</v>

683
00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:32.020
a woman I went out with a few times and every time like even if you were like,

684
00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:36.050
uh,
okay,
so I'll see you later.
And you gave a kiss.

685
00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.600
She would put her tongue in your mouth.
Yeah,

686
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:41.010
<v 7>we,
no,
you mean she would leave with her tongue?
Right.</v>

687
00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:44.280
So she's sticking her tenant like what they're telling you to do?
Like you,

688
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:49.310
<v 0>well just,
I mean it's,
it's for us like what you would expect to be just a,</v>

689
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:54.050
not a make out kiss,
just a peck goodbye.
Goodbye or good.

690
00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:58.460
I picked you up like good to see you.
You'd feel the tongue come into your mouth.

691
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:03.530
And I was like,
I don't know.
I can't get over this.
Who does she,

692
00:44:03.531 --> 00:44:05.450
I remember telling people I worked with,
I was like,

693
00:44:05.451 --> 00:44:08.480
I don't think I can get over this cause I don't know how to bring it up.

694
00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:12.330
<v 7>Yeah.
How do you bring that up to send?
It wasn't a one time.
This was,
oh,</v>

695
00:44:12.331 --> 00:44:13.320
so it was like an accident.

696
00:44:13.321 --> 00:44:17.850
Like I know we went out probably four or five times and every time she gave you

697
00:44:17.851 --> 00:44:22.800
a hello and goodbye kiss,
it was tone.
Every single kiss had tongue.

698
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:25.770
Every single one.
Yeah.
Do you think that she just had it out there,

699
00:44:25.771 --> 00:44:28.960
let you know how parakeets,
like they always have their tongue kind of,

700
00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:33.060
it was just always out.
I,
I think that she,

701
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:37.140
my interpretation was she thought this is super sexy.
Uh,

702
00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:41.820
she's training me and an expert intimacy person,
not a novice like us.

703
00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:45.660
And I was more like,
you don't,
I mean,
you can pull you in,

704
00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:47.130
pull that in sometimes.

705
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:55.080
Yeah.
I mean,
imagine,
imagine if every kiss a tongue was going into,

706
00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:01.580
I don't like too much.
It's too much time.
I don't like math.

707
00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:05.460
I ended up having anxiety about her kisses.
Oh,
of course.
Yeah,
of course.

708
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:10.480
I don't even like mouth kissing.
Um,
friends.
Goodbye.
Yeah.

709
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:14.760
Uh,
or Myra has a,
my son,
I think it's more with women.

710
00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:19.620
I have had women friends where there's definitely,

711
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:24.120
there was nothing there sexually.
They're married or they're,

712
00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:28.500
they're in relationships and they're happy and they greet with mouth kisses.

713
00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:33.330
That's what I'm saying.
And how you,
uh,
now with women,
but with men,

714
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:35.010
male friends and I'm like,

715
00:45:35.011 --> 00:45:38.070
I went and I kind of have to term like I go for the change.
So guys,

716
00:45:38.071 --> 00:45:42.390
we'll lead with it.
Yeah.
See I've never,
I've never obviously never done it to me.

717
00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:46.740
I didn't know that men would lead with it.
Yeah.
It's like a,
it's an la thing.

718
00:45:46.741 --> 00:45:50.720
It's like a,
a hipster,
it's like a cool la person thing.
Really.

719
00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:54.450
If you're cool,
you do a mouth case,
which I don't do,

720
00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:57.370
I don't kiss because now it's like a,

721
00:45:57.371 --> 00:46:02.371
it's like a cool person that I see you [inaudible] yeah.

722
00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:03.180
Yeah.

723
00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:08.070
I mean the last time it felt to me like it was kind of a cool but high society

724
00:46:08.071 --> 00:46:12.150
thing was it was elite people that I,

725
00:46:12.151 --> 00:46:14.130
that I encountered doing that or,

726
00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:18.990
and it always was so jarring to be like,
Whoa,

727
00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:21.510
what'd you just do?
I like that.
I told you I,

728
00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:26.220
I had friends in high school who the whole family kissed on the mouth.

729
00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:29.700
The Sun would kiss the dad's mouth.
The mother would kiss the son's mouth,

730
00:46:29.701 --> 00:46:33.660
the little girl,
the sister would kiss the brother's mouth,
the dad and the,

731
00:46:33.661 --> 00:46:38.460
and the sign would kiss on the mouth.
Like what?
And he was like 17 years old.

732
00:46:38.461 --> 00:46:41.970
A bike at night,
goodbye guys.
Everybody's mouth kissing in the whole family.

733
00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.850
There's a lot.
Super Weird.
I tell you the one time,

734
00:46:44.851 --> 00:46:47.790
and I brought this up on the show like many years ago.

735
00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:53.060
One time I was kissing my stepdad goodbye any turned his head just as I was

736
00:46:53.251 --> 00:46:57.110
going for his cheek and we and I kissed like the corner of his mouth.

737
00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.820
Like I've been thinking about it for 20 years.

738
00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:03.090
That's how long ago that he got to say something then or no,
no.
It was just like,

739
00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.730
ugh.
But you think about it like,
Ugh,

740
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:09.810
that one time I corner mouth kiss my stepdad gross.
That's gross.

741
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:15.480
That would make me uncomfortable.
Mouth Kiss your mom.
Your ever cause your mom,

742
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:21.810
Huh?
It's just like the gaze is just like the gate.
No,

743
00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:26.900
no growth.
No,
I don't want mouth kisses.

744
00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:31.630
Not from your family or strangers.
I even our son,
I feel weird.

745
00:47:31.631 --> 00:47:35.520
I feel like that's not okay.
Mouth Kissing a boy,

746
00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:40.180
kiss their children.
And I know a lot of people do it to small kids.

747
00:47:40.181 --> 00:47:41.740
I think that it's not too crazy.

748
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:45.490
But what happen when the boys like 12 or you still mouth kissing your son?

749
00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:50.590
Probably.
I'm not sure.
That's okay.
You want to give mommy kiss on the mouth.

750
00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:56.150
What else did they have?
The intimacy experts.
These two are the other.

751
00:47:58.480 --> 00:47:59.313
<v 11>That's how it's done.</v>

752
00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:05.270
We saw how we kind of move back and forth and I would pause and then Joanna

753
00:48:05.271 --> 00:48:06.620
would pause.
I would pause.

754
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:09.950
And when you feel the other person pause and you know that's your cue to take

755
00:48:09.951 --> 00:48:14.390
lead and you need the kids for a while,
dance with it.

756
00:48:14.391 --> 00:48:17.150
And he can play inside,
outside,

757
00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:22.040
slowly moving your tongue or you didn't see your teeth just in a gentle way,

758
00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:26.030
but you can do so much and you can feel the energy

759
00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:34.760
<v 7>to be at this.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Okay.
Would you rather,</v>

760
00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:39.740
would you rather
come on?
You don't even listen.
Okay.

761
00:48:39.741 --> 00:48:40.640
Would you rather,

762
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:47.000
would you rather a burning man?

763
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:52.390
We go to burning man for two weeks and you're two weeks.

764
00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:55.580
You're not showering.
You've got the Playa dust,

765
00:48:56.630 --> 00:49:00.530
you've got playa dust in your asshole and your eyes and your beard.
Uh,

766
00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:04.730
you're taking shits and Porta potties.
It's a 120 degrees during the day.

767
00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:09.230
You know me?
Well,
uh,
there's,
there's vagina eating contests.

768
00:49:09.231 --> 00:49:11.030
There's just dirty hippies everywhere.

769
00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.990
Or it's two weeks of the intimacy class

770
00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:19.910
I can't do at burning man for two weeks,

771
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.890
two weeks a one if it's one week each.
What if I shorten the time?

772
00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:29.000
Um,
everything about burning man is what I hate.

773
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:34.100
Or Coachella.
This doesn't start Coachella or to at least entertain me.

774
00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:37.790
I'd be more entertained by intimacy class.
This will be,
but the,

775
00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:41.750
it's the intimacy that makes me uncomfortable because then there'll be like Tom

776
00:49:41.751 --> 00:49:45.810
and Christina,
you guys try it in front of everybody and then I'd be like,
oh,

777
00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.340
I know,
but I would be laughing and I'd like that.

778
00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:51.200
There's air conditioning and there's a bathroom.

779
00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:54.650
All that really bothers me about those festivals.

780
00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:58.010
Burning man in particular because it's playa dust.

781
00:49:58.011 --> 00:50:01.410
You're out on a Applia,
whatever.
And they all had some,

782
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:06.250
some fucking idiot that listens to our show.
Messaged me about.
He's like,

783
00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:08.460
when did you become like,

784
00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:12.370
like such a bitch about crowds?
Oh,

785
00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:14.840
always like we talking about.
Yeah.
And also,

786
00:50:14.841 --> 00:50:19.841
I never understand when somebody like upset about you not liking something that

787
00:50:19.941 --> 00:50:20.940
they like.
Yes.

788
00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:25.520
Like why the fuck do you think that that's a logical point to bring up?

789
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:28.130
Hey Man,
I festivals.

790
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:32.920
<v 0>How can you not like fast?
Well,
I'm not you.
You dumb.
Fuck.
Yeah,
I know.
He uh,</v>

791
00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:35.600
he has to have everybody agree with him.
Why would it in the world?

792
00:50:35.601 --> 00:50:39.440
We all have to like the same things,
but they're obviously,

793
00:50:39.441 --> 00:50:42.530
there are scores of people who love burning man,

794
00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:46.390
love Coachella and many more who don't.
It's just not for us.
Yeah,
of course.

795
00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:52.190
Not My scene,
man.
I'm a fucking adult.
I can't do that crap.

796
00:50:52.191 --> 00:50:56.690
Somebody,
I'm an adult message this,
this was pretty grown ass woman.

797
00:50:56.691 --> 00:51:01.360
I don't sit in my own filth for a week like an Asshole,
you know?

798
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:05.390
Here we go.
Look at this.
Hold on.
Email.
Hey mommies.

799
00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:08.240
I was talking to my wife about our weight loss.

800
00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:12.350
I for completely forgot what inspired me to change my life.

801
00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:17.840
In the summer of 2014 I weighed just over 500 pounds.
Wow.

802
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:21.770
I was always the big funny guy.
I love comedy.
One night after work,

803
00:51:21.771 --> 00:51:25.400
my wife and I decided to watch Tom's special.
Well,
as you know,

804
00:51:25.401 --> 00:51:29.180
you have a bit about how you shouldn't have diarrhea every day and Mommy,

805
00:51:29.181 --> 00:51:32.570
Tina offers a ride to the hospital.
This is 100% true.
By the way.

806
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:35.720
That bit is based on reality.
You came out,

807
00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:37.610
we were in silver lake and you came out and I go,

808
00:51:37.611 --> 00:51:40.220
do you need to go to the hospital and that line is in the vet.

809
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:43.790
I mean that's the real line.
That shit was the funniest thing I've ever heard.

810
00:51:43.791 --> 00:51:48.710
I remember thinking,
Haha,
only.
Oh my God,
that's totally true.
That's me.

811
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:50.840
Oh my God.
That is me.

812
00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:54.440
It was the only statement that actually broke through my fat head.

813
00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:58.090
And now I'm down 225 pounds.
Wow.

814
00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:02.990
My wife joined me soon after she's lost 125 pounds together.

815
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:07.760
We've lost half a burnt Chrysler.
Wow.
I made this true.
So thank you.

816
00:52:07.761 --> 00:52:09.530
You're coming to does a lot more than make people laugh.

817
00:52:09.531 --> 00:52:13.850
I haven't gotten updated before and after and over a year.
But here's some proof.

818
00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:17.600
Next time you're in Columbus,
come over for some Mousse to

819
00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:22.550
look this guy.

You don't need to see her.

861
00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:21.140
I mean she looks like how you imagine.
Let's just put it that way.

862
00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:22.730
Like she looks like that person.

863
00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:28.340
<v 4>They don't know</v>

864

quite a voice.
Yeah.

865
00:55:39.850 --> 00:55:41.740
Jackson Jackson.

866
00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:48.960
<v 0>This is actually somebody who I'm better suited to impersonate than you are and</v>

867
00:55:49.061 --> 00:55:49.894
it's a woman,

868
00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:54.140
<v 4>but my natural,

Jackson.

872
00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:12.010
<v 0>Okay.
How do you get that voice?
It starts to,</v>

873
00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:14.950
cause here's the thing.
I have a pretty deep lady voice.

874
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:20.170
Do you think in 20 years I could get moose soup,
lady voice.
Um,
I dunno,

875
00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:22.180
but I'd have to start smoking again.

876
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:28.060
I Dunno if this is a sure.
I,
no,
it's somebody else's.

877
00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:32.860
Um,
yeah,
there's a lot of smoking involved,
but I have to start smoking again.

878
00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:36.250
Yeah.
Here she is a,
this is my,
another good one.

879
00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:40.250
Just and it's on like a blue Jay.

880
00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:42.630
Can you add on the water?

881
00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:48.000
<v 13>Small boats.
I mean there's barn</v>

882
00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:51.323
too loud.

883
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.530
<v 0>Two lines.
Two at a horrible,
yeah,
the,
the,
yeah,</v>

884
00:56:57.010 --> 00:57:01.420
it's too,
that doesn't work,
but you get the idea.
It's those types of,

885
00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:04.700
<v 5>it's really her.
It's all her.
It's all real.</v>

886
00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:08.930
<v 0>Yeah.
It moves soup.
She sells Musu.
It's on,</v>

887
00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:10.850
she has a garage sale right now.

888
00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:14.900
She just knows about a garage sale and she's like,
I have moved to bread.

889
00:57:14.901 --> 00:57:18.320
Dinner Rolls.
I Dunno.
She posted the phone number.

890
00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:22.710
<v 5>That's crazy.
Guys do not,
if you find her,
please leave her alone.
Don't,
yeah.</v>

891
00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:27.030
Don't we don't want to interrupt this.
She's a normal person living a life flake.

892
00:57:27.031 --> 00:57:27.740
Let's not

893
00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:31.980
<v 0>mass with says Musu,
but she's just,
she's a bad ass dude.
She's,
Oh,
she,</v>

894
00:57:32.010 --> 00:57:36.960
it says that she's a,
a professional cook.
Oh,
wow.

895
00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:41.590
Yeah.
So maybe she does make amazing new soup,
you know?
That's cool.
Well,

896
00:57:41.591 --> 00:57:46.110
next time we're in Alaska,
we should look her up.
She's single,
not too,

897
00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:50.190
there you go.
Yeah.
What'd you date?
The Musubi Lady?
No,

898
00:57:50.250 --> 00:57:54.900
I think at this time in my life it's not appropriate.
Why?
I'm younger.

899
00:57:56.760 --> 00:58:00.200
Maybe wait a little while.
How long is this your,
is this your wife?

900
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:02.880
<v 5>[inaudible] I don't think,
what does my wife after me like again?</v>

901
00:58:03.330 --> 00:58:06.630
So we had this discussion.
Who,

you're probably gonna.

903
00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:13.440

I think,
I think you should point out that at first I suggested,
I was like,</v>

904
00:58:13.650 --> 00:58:16.680
oh,
I could see it being like a Latin guy.
And you're like,
yeah.
And I go,

905
00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:20.130
you're like a Brazilian or something?
And you're like,
oh,
I could see that.

906
00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:22.320
So it was like,
that's what I set up to you.
I was like,

907
00:58:22.770 --> 00:58:27.260
I could see that being your next go.
Brazilian.
I Love Portuguese.
Yeah.

908
00:58:27.261 --> 00:58:30.900
And that's how the hearing you were like,
Oh that is neat.
And then you go,
I go,

909
00:58:30.901 --> 00:58:33.860
what about me?
And you said,
and I go,
I see you with some

910

00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:38.760
I'm going to fucking piss on your balls.

912
00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:42.780
And then when I put a baseball bat in my ass,
like stuff like that.

913
00:58:42.781 --> 00:58:43.730
That's what I see you with.

914
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:47.900
<v 0>Okay,

919
00:59:01.911 --> 00:59:06.680
You might get so famous that reality gets distorted like it does with a lot of

920
00:59:06.681 --> 00:59:09.620
really famous guys.
You can be that guy,

921
00:59:09.621 --> 00:59:13.120
pushing your dick through a wire fence to get it sucked.
And then I,

923
00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:15.013
<v 0>That's not weird.</v>

924
00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:21.280

927
00:59:24.411 --> 00:59:25.880
Why did she piss on my balls?

928
00:59:25.881 --> 00:59:30.740
So you like it is because you've been repressing your savage desire?
Yes,

929

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:21.820
Ryan sperm in California.
But that,

959
01:01:21.850 --> 01:01:24.460
I think the last time I did a show at your place,

960
01:01:24.461 --> 01:01:28.220
it's been a couple of years when you were in the old students.

961
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:33.100
Like our old place.
Yeah.
By the beach area.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Long time ago.

962
01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:37.030
We've had two studios since,
right,
Tom?
Yeah.
Yeah.
One,
two.

963
01:01:37.031 --> 01:01:39.370
And this is the third one.
So we just,
yeah.

964
01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:42.850
And actually if you want to add up all the different rooms we've done it in.

965
01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:46.990
There's that,
there's the first room and silver lake.
Yeah.
Oh that's right.
Yeah.

966
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.970
Oh Gee.
Smile.
That's the,
but then the beach.
Yup.

967
01:01:52.030 --> 01:01:56.680
Room.
Then the beach office I went to.
Yeah,
he did that one too.

968
01:01:56.770 --> 01:01:59.860
Then the rental house.
Yeah.

969
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:05.030
And then here,
so there's five total rooms.
I know.
Let's help.

970
01:02:05.031 --> 01:02:08.210
This one stays for awhile.
Oh my God.
Like a sports franchise finding.

971
01:02:08.211 --> 01:02:11.030
You guys got a real,
I mean,
real really fancy.
Yeah.
Yeah.

972
01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:15.590
This is a real place to do it in men.
So it's,
um,
it's always good to see you,
man.

973
01:02:15.591 --> 01:02:19.220
It's good.
I'm glad you could come here.
Alright.
Okay.
So

974
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:22.230
<v 14>you would have to be here.</v>

975
01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:28.360
<v 0>I know you've been,
you've been doing a lot of things,
man.
You were,</v>

976
01:02:28.361 --> 01:02:32.500
were you in Europe you said?
Right?
And recently,
yeah.
But before your fans are so,

977
01:02:33.310 --> 01:02:37.150
I mean,
there's just so cool.
Love you.
You're,
you're,
you're a home run with it.

978
01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:38.680
When it comes to our fans in this show,

979
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:40.560
<v 15>they're very,
very kind.
And He,
Dave,</v>

980
01:02:40.561 --> 01:02:45.470
we'll even show up in some shady dive bars.
I couldn't believe it.
Really?
Yeah,

981
01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.690
they're always coupling and no matter how,

982
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:51.710
how much of a horrible thing I see in stage,
they're,
they're just so,

983
01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.650
<v 0>and you're good at that.
You say some horrible,
horrible thing.</v>

984
01:02:54.890 --> 01:02:58.380
<v 14>Yes.
I'm going to do the last show.</v>

985
01:02:58.430 --> 01:03:02.690
<v 15>This lady,
I think the tail end of the show your fans over there.</v>

986
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:05.490
[inaudible] she said,
I laugh at every joke you,

987
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:09.630
I even left at Joe 15 joke.
But when you make jokes by age,

988
01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:12.770
my brother died 25 years ago and she was very upset with me.

989
01:03:13.330 --> 01:03:17.990
When people are upset,
I let them say whatever they paid.
So,
and um,

990
01:03:18.030 --> 01:03:22.110
<v 0>how does it affect you when they,
when they're,
when they are upset and does it,</v>

991
01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.060
does it affect you in some way though?
Cause it,

992
01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:27.330
<v 15>I mean I'm at,
believe it or not,
I do have feelings,
but I like the,</v>

993
01:03:27.331 --> 01:03:29.490
I don't want to get into the detail,
but there's not,

994
01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:32.870
not once have ounce of malice net joke.
It was trying to make it

995
01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:36.450
<v 0>totally believe you.
I,
I'm trying to make people be sympathetic way.</v>

996
01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:37.440
How do you handle her?

997
01:03:37.441 --> 01:03:41.220
Like when she says I'm a very upset and she's done saying it.

998
01:03:41.221 --> 01:03:42.690
Do you say something in response?

999
01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:45.570
<v 15>Like I let her,
I don't interrupt.</v>

1000
01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:50.150
I let her say it because this is not,
she was trying to get attention.

1001
01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:53.720
She was genuine in her and she was hearing me say horrible stuff.

1002
01:03:53.721 --> 01:03:56.870
She was a all the way with me for the tail end of it.

1003
01:03:57.290 --> 01:04:00.500
I let her speak on away and she got her staff,

1004
01:04:00.501 --> 01:04:03.430
she got out and she said that she closed the door.
And I said,

1005
01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:08.150
but I have 20 more h jokes for you.
And if people laugh,
but um,

1006
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:13.520
situation like that,
you,
you should let them say whatever.
I'm okay with that.
Um,

1007
01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:18.200
and I think this is something that I face a lot in Sweden.
You know,

1008
01:04:18.201 --> 01:04:22.070
I remember saying something about women,
they literally,
they take jokes,

1009
01:04:22.071 --> 01:04:25.430
literally dig it upset without not knowing the intention.

1010
01:04:25.431 --> 01:04:29.120
Would that make sense to you?
But what I also tell them,
like,

1011
01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:33.380
I don't have a problem when you speak in during the show.
Uh,
and uh,

1012
01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:35.660
that's okay with me.
But when you do that,

1013
01:04:35.661 --> 01:04:39.320
you're basically saying everyone in the room have no rights to hear what I have

1014
01:04:39.321 --> 01:04:42.920
to say because people jumped to conclusion about right.
So,
but I tell you,

1015
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:45.650
I don't think this is just me and there's a lot of comedians are facing this

1016
01:04:45.651 --> 01:04:50.580
like a couple of weeks ago when bill mark,
I'm in trouble for that joke.
Uh,

1017
01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:55.280
he's been very supportive minorities,
you know,
um,
I listened to that joke.

1018
01:04:55.281 --> 01:04:56.120
He used an anywhere.

1019
01:04:56.180 --> 01:05:00.020
I don't think it was malicious at all and people are just overreacting.

1020
01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:03.970
<v 0>Well,
it was a pretty big reaction.
I think,
you know,
people,
he,
um,</v>

1021
01:05:04.930 --> 01:05:07.980
<v 15>he got bigger issues,
a institutionalized,</v>

1022
01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:11.580
I can't even say that racism and young black kids getting shot and those are the

1023
01:05:11.581 --> 01:05:12.414
bigger issues.

1024
01:05:12.550 --> 01:05:14.860
<v 0>I got a joke.
Not a joke.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think,</v>

1025
01:05:14.861 --> 01:05:19.861
I think he did do that thing where it's like him saying that joke.

1026
01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:25.180
If he were like hanging out with like in a room,
yeah.
Would be,

1027
01:05:25.210 --> 01:05:28.180
people would laugh and have no like with him if he was with comics for sure.

1028
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:31.570
Right.
Um,
but doing it on TV,
it's like,

1029
01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:36.040
it's one of those things where I think people interpret it as,

1030
01:05:36.090 --> 01:05:39.130
it's not so much the joke.
Yeah.
But they're going youth,

1031
01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:41.740
you think you have a pass.
Right.

1032
01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:46.030
Why do you think that's what a lot of people were taking it,
right?
Yeah.

1033
01:05:46.031 --> 01:05:48.580
Like why do you get to say that?
You know?

1034
01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:51.980
<v 15>And also people who are,
who are not a fan of his,
and I don't want you to comedy.</v>

1035
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.180
Yeah.
When they see a small clip on youtube,

1036
01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:57.140
they just make all this assumption now knowing,
believe me,

1037
01:05:57.141 --> 01:05:58.760
he has done a lot of good things out there.

1038
01:05:58.761 --> 01:06:01.640
I'm a fan and especially where the drug policies,
you know,
he's,

1039
01:06:01.641 --> 01:06:06.170
he's so spend finding the joy for it.
Yeah.
So,
but we live in the PE.

1040
01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:07.670
People are gonna attack you no matter what.

1041
01:06:07.890 --> 01:06:10.200
<v 5>Absolutely.
Well,
and I think people have always,</v>

1042
01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:12.330
there's always been these assholes,
assholes,

1043
01:06:12.331 --> 01:06:14.520
people who are offended at everything.

1044
01:06:14.521 --> 01:06:18.210
And it used to be that you had to call the television station and now you can

1045
01:06:18.211 --> 01:06:21.330
just immediately get outraged on Twitter.
You can reach,

1046
01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:25.080
but you can tweak Bill Maher himself right now.
He knows who's mad at him.

1047
01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:29.310
It's the immediacy of communication too,
I think.
I don't know.
Yeah.
So anyway,

1048
01:06:29.311 --> 01:06:34.110
you know,
she mentioned that you're doing some medical testing lately,
right?

1049
01:06:34.111 --> 01:06:36.060
Are you doing,
did you just say that you were finishing something?

1050
01:06:36.270 --> 01:06:39.700
<v 15>I finished one and three months ago and probably going to do another one.
Um,</v>

1051
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:44.360
late next month it's going to be 36 days.
I haven't qualified 36 day.
Yeah,

1052
01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.760
this one's on a minute.
What are you doing?
I don't know.
The drug spend,

1053
01:06:47.761 --> 01:06:51.370
like I always say,
I only have ancient Monday pay,
so they just like,

1054
01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:56.250
is it paying a fortune 12,
almost 13 granite?
Think that's pretty good.
Oh,

1055
01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:59.850
I think the saying is how long is the stay?
How much is the pay?

1056
01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:04.230
<v 0>What are you,
do you know what they're going to be testing?</v>

1057
01:07:04.310 --> 01:07:07.340
<v 15>No,
but,
uh,
I,
I,
I don't really care per se.</v>

1058
01:07:07.341 --> 01:07:11.090
Most of them only do they care about is if it's anything to do with deep brain

1059
01:07:11.091 --> 01:07:15.560
related,
like if you have a bipolar or any of those kind of mental medications,

1060
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:20.300
I will not touch those.
But cancer,
uh,
I dunno.
Um,

1061
01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.070
Alzheimer's.
You've gone for all of it?
Yeah,
I've done it.

1062
01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:26.460
<v 5>Yeah.
Send a problem.
What will they do to you in 36?</v>

1063
01:07:27.550 --> 01:07:29.670
What will they do to you in 36 days?

1064
01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:32.000
<v 15>This is what typically usually happened.
Um,</v>

1065
01:07:32.030 --> 01:07:35.180
I'm not even considering my taking the medication,
so it's,
I'm always like,

1066
01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:37.880
everyone is starving because they cut down on your calorie.

1067
01:07:38.270 --> 01:07:43.270
Like I got as low as one 16 last studies I brought back again,

1068
01:07:43.971 --> 01:07:47.240
like 17 pounds by already know.
Once I going for 36 days,

1069
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:51.470
I'm going to drop at least 20 to 25 pounds.
So it's like a diet for you too.

1070
01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:54.600
That's the biggest reason I'd rather lose weight.
Yeah.

1071
01:07:55.790 --> 01:07:59.180
That's my number where I need to lose weight,
that I'm too lazy to lose.

1072
01:07:59.181 --> 01:08:02.620
When I mean you did an amazing job.
I mean look,
I lost some weight.
Yeah,

1073
01:08:02.621 --> 01:08:03.630
I lost you look great.

1074
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:08.510
<v 0>Thanks buddy.
I mean I lost 50 pounds
and I've kept it off.</v>

1075
01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.750
I actually lost a couple more pounds since the a way in.

1076
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:15.500
<v 15>Yeah.
Yeah.
It's good cause you know,
I mean you have a wine,</v>

1077
01:08:15.501 --> 01:08:20.120
but most importantly you have a child,
you know,
and some of my are,

1078
01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:22.910
I don't want to mention names,
but some of the comedian's friend of mine,

1079
01:08:23.270 --> 01:08:27.900
they're overwhelmed.
I'm just worried about their kids more now.
Russell.
Yeah.
Hi.

1080
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:33.150
Oh sorry.
By the way,
when I saw Peter say he'll,

1081
01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:38.160
he'll want to do podcasts that love to have him Europe.

1082
01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:41.990
So I was there.
You don't know.
You don't know what you're,
sorry.

1083
01:08:41.991 --> 01:08:44.660
You don't know what you're getting into for this next.
No.

1084
01:08:44.661 --> 01:08:48.050
Can you find out what the drug is and can you pull the plug on it?

1085
01:08:48.051 --> 01:08:51.070
Like if they show up and you show up and it's something you don't want to do,

1086
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:55.460
can you say no and leave or,
sure.
So basically when you have a,

1087
01:08:56.290 --> 01:08:58.670
like I got,
I just emailed him like I'm running out of money.

1088
01:08:58.670 --> 01:09:02.570
So that's when I usually email them and then they'll still me.

1089
01:09:02.571 --> 01:09:04.130
These are the following studies.
So we have,

1090
01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:08.940
and then above that that I just love the,
the system for you.

1091
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:12.680
Like I'm running out of money.
What,
what medical tests do you have going on?

1092
01:09:12.830 --> 01:09:15.620
There's like four or five different facilities in southern California.

1093
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:16.460
And this one,

1094
01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:21.320
this guy always email me back right away because they're always afraid.

1095
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:26.400
Even if they pass the screening,
they go in after five 60 they can't do anymore.

1096
01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:30.710
They just lose their mind.
Cause you,
you can leave,
you know,
and you're hungry.

1097
01:09:30.711 --> 01:09:33.530
You're hands are shaking because no coffee and caffeine,

1098
01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:38.680
all the tests dictate low calorie intake.
Like no matter what you're going,

1099
01:09:38.750 --> 01:09:42.170
no.
So Ds,
Ds business.
Okay.

1100
01:09:42.171 --> 01:09:45.970
So every pharmaceutical companies make drugs to me trying to make profit.

1101
01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:50.780
Billions of dollars in profit,
right?
Yeah.
But it's hit and miss.
Um,

1102
01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:54.440
but they don't have a drug to be tested every day.
So they have another,

1103
01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:58.310
another business called Cro,
clinical research organization.

1104
01:09:58.550 --> 01:10:02.330
All they do is they get contacted by a pharmaceutical company and say,
Hey,

1105
01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:04.210
we have x medication.

1106
01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:09.110
We'd like to test it on people and we need 40 people between this age at this

1107
01:10:09.111 --> 01:10:11.690
body mass index.
And they kind of be a smoker.

1108
01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:16.370
So they have all kinds of different criteria for each medication based on each

1109
01:10:16.371 --> 01:10:19.400
pharmaceutical company.
So since there's some studies,
we could drink coffee.

1110
01:10:19.401 --> 01:10:21.740
Great.
There's other studies where you could do,

1111
01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:26.210
you could do almost anything now there's other studies,
so strict,

1112
01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:31.340
you know,
no sugar,
low calorie and yeah,

1113
01:10:31.341 --> 01:10:34.880
so those are the ones like,
so you want to get forced to die.
It actually,

1114
01:10:34.881 --> 01:10:37.850
you want,
you want to,
that's,
that's one of the major benefits.

1115
01:10:37.851 --> 01:10:41.630
So when people say like it's dangerous,
but like,
man,
I feel,

1116
01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:45.660
I feel so much better when you lose weight and be skinny.
It feels better.
Yeah.

1117
01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:50.840
So now,
I mean,
here's a question because you've done so many different teams.

1118
01:10:50.841 --> 01:10:53.000
You've had all these chemicals in you.

1119
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:58.160
I mean at some point don't you think that the body is tampered with?

1120
01:10:58.161 --> 01:11:02.750
Like do you mean like he's not pure specimen anymore for us to test a Tabula

1121
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:03.583
Rasa so to speak,
you're,

1122
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:08.540
you're kind of tainted goods by only feel like that feel like,
you know,

1123
01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:12.980
I had this conversation two years ago in Vegas and this,

1124
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:17.550
I don't remember his name at the Party and he was telling me,
Oh my God,

1125
01:11:17.551 --> 01:11:20.040
I wouldn't live with that.
That's your stupid to do that.
That's too dangerous.

1126
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:25.350
And he was telling me while he was ready to snort coke so everyone have a

1127
01:11:25.351 --> 01:11:29.610
different idea of what's dangerous.
So you're right,
I mean I,

1128
01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:34.620
I can't tell you if I would have never gone to this business versus now that I'm

1129
01:11:35.011 --> 01:11:38.870
taking a two version of Yoshi is,
which one would have been the health.

1130
01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:41.840
<v 5>Oh No,
I'm not saying that.
I'm just saying that.
I wonder if your body,</v>

1131
01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:46.070
is it good to be the Guinea pig today?
Yeah.
Like it,

1132
01:11:46.071 --> 01:11:47.810
because you've done so many of these,

1133
01:11:47.811 --> 01:11:51.170
like at what point can you not do them anymore?
Because you've ingested.

1134
01:11:51.171 --> 01:11:52.520
So I see that

1135
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:53.670
<v 15>age,</v>

1136
01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:57.560
you age restriction or I know just chemical restriction like because you like

1137
01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:02.650
they go,
thanks guys,
this guy has been tested on a hundred medications,

1138
01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:07.780
therefore you know,
that's like you can't do it.
And thing is like too many miles.

1139
01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:10.660
I'm not saying that I did it so then to it.
Yeah.

1140
01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:15.420
But many of these organizations don't talk to each other so they don't know what

1141
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:20.050
he did.
I'll know.
So what happened is general rule is day way on Theo,

1142
01:12:20.051 --> 01:12:24.400
30 days before they contact you because it takes about two to three weeks for

1143
01:12:24.401 --> 01:12:26.740
their whole medication to get out of your system.

1144
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:32.200
So to be safe on one month,
but there's times if you're broke,

1145
01:12:32.230 --> 01:12:36.340
you finished one study,
you drive across the town.
I'm not saying I did it.
Uh,

1146
01:12:36.341 --> 01:12:39.760
you could drive from one study to another study and you barely make it there and

1147
01:12:39.761 --> 01:12:44.170
do another screening.
I hop onto another studies,
but there's these group of guys,

1148
01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:47.830
uh,
I only do in Solo Caleb.
There's a group of guys,
it's like fight club.

1149
01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:52.270
They go literally city to city,
state to stay,
you know,

1150
01:12:53.050 --> 01:12:55.720
do studies all over the place.
I,
I'll see a guy's like,
oh,

1151
01:12:55.721 --> 01:12:58.210
I remember you at the 2014 liver cancer study,
what's up?

1152
01:12:58.211 --> 01:13:01.300
And then they'd call me why all for Yoshi Obayashi I don't remember the guy's

1153
01:13:01.301 --> 01:13:05.230
name,
km or whatever.
So that would be an issue for each other.
But um,

1154
01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:08.950
so there's a circuit and you know all the players and a lot of them.
Yeah.

1155
01:13:08.951 --> 01:13:13.170
I mean it's almost like when will you go in if you go in for this one,
the,

1156
01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:15.650
I think they're going to call me within the next,
uh,

1157
01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:19.270
seven to 10 days for screening.
Then after they do the testing,

1158
01:13:19.450 --> 01:13:23.680
well first they make you read the
document,
legal documents.

1159
01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:28.060
Tell him you just page through that,
right?
Yeah,
I have to re well,
yes.

1160
01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:31.810
Only there's only one facility that test you because if they,

1161
01:13:31.811 --> 01:13:32.860
if you filled out tests,

1162
01:13:32.890 --> 01:13:36.490
they know that you didn't read it and then they'll disqualify for other places.

1163
01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:38.770
Other places,
they don't give a shit.
There's one particular,

1164
01:13:38.771 --> 01:13:39.880
is that there so shady.

1165
01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:44.350
Even if you get caught doing something wrong like get out of the room,

1166
01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:47.770
talked to another person,
Redo the interview second time around to pass it.

1167
01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:48.880
They will do stuff like that.

1168
01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:52.630
I'm not going to tell you which one cause I need now when you were,

1169
01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:55.700
you were just doing a European tour with Jim Norton?
Yeah,

1170
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:58.170
I just happened to be there for um,

1171
01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:03.880
Oslo Freedom Forum for like a okay men,
right stuff.
Do you happen to be there?

1172
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:04.750
I'll having to be there.

1173
01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:08.110
Then his manager who we're not going to talk about it but contact you as well.

1174
01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:12.730
He asked me could you help Jim seal tickets or you know where it's a good place

1175
01:14:12.731 --> 01:14:15.340
to visit.
I just happened to be in the same week when he was performing,

1176
01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:19.810
so by default ended up open for him and it wasn't.
It was great.

1177
01:14:19.811 --> 01:14:23.710
I'm glad because there's a lot of comedians that you guys are such an open

1178
01:14:23.711 --> 01:14:26.710
minded people.
I know you don't have a fear of going overseas and doing comedy,

1179
01:14:26.711 --> 01:14:29.500
but there's a lot of funny people in the,
in America during standup.

1180
01:14:29.650 --> 01:14:34.650
I'm one reason that they don't like going overseas so they have this irrational

1181
01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.250
fear but I dunno,

1182
01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:39.910
they just don't go for some reason he donated by it or something.
Yeah.

1183
01:14:40.150 --> 01:14:43.090
And I'm glammed Jim Derek cause shame did extremely well.
And uh,

1184
01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:48.280
Bahrain who is our tour manager,
he was in charge of Public Francisco,

1185
01:14:48.370 --> 01:14:52.040
fluffy and Belbor and he told us basically Jim Soda,

1186
01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:54.610
same amount of tickets belbor first year he went to Europe.

1187
01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:58.120
It was very successful and Jim,

1188
01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:02.530
it was good exposure to see a side of this country is such a good comic though.

1189
01:15:03.150 --> 01:15:05.420
And surprise me on top of it.

1190
01:15:05.730 --> 01:15:09.270
Now at the g there's at any ladies of the night when you were touring,

1191
01:15:09.370 --> 01:15:13.210
you are so perceptive.
When we,
when we were in what I guess

1192
01:15:14.770 --> 01:15:19.300
when we went to Antwerp to do a show afterwards,

1193
01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:21.430
Jim want to go and check it out.
Uh,

1194
01:15:21.490 --> 01:15:24.790
Jim has never been to those places and he wouldn't do it because it's too low

1195
01:15:24.791 --> 01:15:29.100
class cause he get,
he get the high end first class,
you know,

1196
01:15:29.101 --> 01:15:33.890
I'm the southwest of Hooker,
you know,
pick up outweighs.

1197
01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:38.420
He is like,
you know,
first class,
Lufthansa,
whatever.
But um,

1198
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:43.440
so we went to the one in Antwerp and a,
it's a midsize level one and um,

1199
01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:47.800
it was really good.
And what kind of prostitutes there?
Where are they from?

1200
01:15:48.130 --> 01:15:50.250
Mostly Eastern Europe,
but uh,

1201
01:15:51.190 --> 01:15:56.190
but I do notice last couple of years because European economic crisis you do

1202
01:15:56.770 --> 01:16:01.030
every once we'll see like,
wow,
you're German or your Dutch and Greek and Spanish,

1203
01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:05.080
Spanish,
Spanish people and Brexit.
That's probably doesn't help.
I mean there's,

1204
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:10.450
there's,
there's fear in Europe about all the changes,
not just terrorism,
but,

1205
01:16:10.451 --> 01:16:14.530
um,
job wise,
you know,
and um,

1206
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:16.930
I don't think Jim got a girl,

1207
01:16:16.931 --> 01:16:21.931
but what I was surprised that every window with transsexual lady,

1208
01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:26.320
I mean,
they look so good.
Like I can't even tell I have relived men.

1209
01:16:26.321 --> 01:16:30.280
Jim was hundred percent knew right away.
Like,
I dunno how he does it.
I mean,

1210
01:16:30.281 --> 01:16:35.040
I'm putting,
knew that that was a shemale that Shimo mushy meals.

1211
01:16:35.050 --> 01:16:39.250
I forget.
There's no,
no one,
I can't afford it.
But now that's not,

1212
01:16:39.251 --> 01:16:43.800
never been in mind.
Is that a premium they cost more?
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.

1213
01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:48.340
Why?
Why?
Why wouldn't you think that?
Cause I just don't know why.

1214
01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:53.020
Um,
I don't know what they cost more and I guess considered more exotic.
So it's,

1215
01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:56.170
I think so.
Wow.
And well,
I mean it,

1216
01:16:56.171 --> 01:16:59.710
it seems like their prices are a lot higher than other ones,
you know?
Wow.

1217
01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:03.280
Not The black ones though.
Those cheaper.

1218
01:17:04.810 --> 01:17:08.110
They are the best of both worlds.
The transsexual,
I imagine.
Sure.

1219
01:17:08.130 --> 01:17:10.040
That's why it's like a bonus features.
And when did

1220
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:13.850
<v 6>you do that interview with,
with London Real Linden Real TV?
That was,</v>

1221
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:17.560
was that on this trip?
Wait a minute.
I don't remember this one.

1222
01:17:17.650 --> 01:17:20.020

So they had to skin.

1225
01:17:28.090 --> 01:17:31.680

Well,

1262
01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:09.960
sharpening the knife.
He calls it.
Oh.

1263
01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:12.990
And it's like master control of your orgasms,

1264
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:16.720
are just so many pressure.

1265
01:20:18.170 --> 01:20:21.880
Like I said,
I don't have to be here.
Exercise.

1266
01:20:22.570 --> 01:20:27.390
I say Simon and fall.
People have prospect land stolen or problem.

1267
01:20:27.630 --> 01:20:31.880
This one who solved the problem and now you're doing until you feel,
okay,

1268
01:20:31.881 --> 01:20:36.570
so this is it here.
Oh yeah.
Cause where you can't grow without ejaculation,

1269
01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:41.100

Yeah.
So you feel,
so you see when you do,
when,

1270
01:20:41.490 --> 01:20:44.180
when you get it,
it's very quick to two times.
You can

1271
01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:50.500
just all guests,
I'm coming up.

1272
01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:59.190
This is a different variation of Tai Chi touch me.

1273
01:20:59.370 --> 01:21:03.360
So yeah,
you could do the 50 50 50 rubs.

1274
01:21:03.570 --> 01:21:05.430
No Way.
No Way.
Right?

1275
01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:10.460
5,350 is what do you edit up 350 strokes every day so you can control it.

1276
01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:14.980
I mean Rocco can do that.
The rest of us can't.

1277
01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:20.890
Freddy's the king hard to Rocco lately.
Do you know him personally?
No.

1278
01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:22.020
Last time I heard it from him,

1279
01:21:22.021 --> 01:21:26.460
it's when Joyce Rivera called me in Boston when I was doing shows there and he

1280
01:21:26.461 --> 01:21:28.630
wasn't going with Bronco and say Runco Save.

1281
01:21:28.631 --> 01:21:32.190
I'm sad to hear that you don't work at evil angel and I hope you're doing well.

1282
01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:36.750
So they're,
they're nice people and,
um,
he's such an animal.

1283
01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:38.753
I kid,

1284
01:21:38.970 --> 01:21:43.650
I laughed thinking about like I imagine over the years in my mind,

1285
01:21:43.651 --> 01:21:46.440
conversations he has with his wife who's like,
she's like,

1286
01:21:46.441 --> 01:21:50.040
when is enough of this potent,
I do it for the fans.

1287
01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:55.890
We pay the bills.
How am I going to make any money?
Hey,
you know,

1288
01:21:55.891 --> 01:21:56.724
it's not even for me.

1289
01:21:58.190 --> 01:22:01.920
It was kind of enraptured by your dreams.

1290
01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:07.710
I do it for them.
I know.
You know what's interesting,

1291
01:22:07.770 --> 01:22:10.020
he released a documentary.

1292
01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:14.730
We didn't launch a year or two about his sex addiction problems when we played

1293
01:22:14.731 --> 01:22:18.980
the,
uh,
the trailer love to,
and we watched that.

1294
01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:20.450
I Dunno,
I dunno.

1295
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:25.470
I'm fascinated by him actually at a Russell Peters taping a few years back.

1296
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:27.800
I had a Rocco came to that stage,
cons,

1297
01:22:27.850 --> 01:22:32.850
I backstage conversation with Rocco and I don't remember this.

1298
01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:37.400
So you met at the Wiltern now?
I think Tom was anyways.
Um,

1299
01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:40.740
and I met him and we had a really good personal conversation.

1300
01:22:40.741 --> 01:22:42.560
He told me about it.
Some childhood stuff.
No,

1301
01:22:42.561 --> 01:22:45.870
I swear to God he's super cold cause he knows I was Hungarian and his wife was

1302
01:22:45.871 --> 01:22:49.860
Hungarian.
He loves all Garren girls.
Yeah.
Oh Wow.
Anyways,

1303
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:52.840
I really like him as a human,
but you know what

1304
01:22:58.590 --> 01:22:59.550
and he's such a funny guy.

1305
01:22:59.570 --> 01:23:03.870
Did I tell you that one time he was so disappointed that he was telling me that

1306
01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:07.300
I don't know these kids,
he was talking about his like uh,
nephews and stuff.

1307
01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:09.340
Like I don't know what's going,
what the fuck's wrong with his kids?

1308
01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:13.300
None of them went into get into porn of and all they ever talk about video
games.

1309
01:23:13.301 --> 01:23:16.840
He was complaining about video games,
social media and uh,

1310
01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:22.080
you told me that sometimes that that passes through my head as such a hilarious

1311
01:23:22.721 --> 01:23:26.270
dialogue that somebody like sign

1312
01:23:27.850 --> 01:23:31.840
16 now it's your turn to make a partner in.
The kid's like,

1313
01:23:32.570 --> 01:23:37.150
I want to play grand theft auto.
And he's like,
no,
but 16 is pardon the time.

1314
01:23:37.630 --> 01:23:41.770
And the kid is like,
but I just want to play video games dad.
And he's like,

1315
01:23:41.771 --> 01:23:46.600
what is wrong with these boys?
I think sets that,
I think I didn't,

1316
01:23:46.630 --> 01:23:47.830
I haven't seen the documentary,

1317
01:23:47.831 --> 01:23:51.150
but if you've ever been completely like being real about it.
Yeah.

1318
01:23:51.370 --> 01:23:52.700
When you're in that business,

1319
01:23:52.701 --> 01:23:55.990
so you have a drug addiction and whatever the addiction is because you have a

1320
01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:59.230
something missing,
you don't life intimacy,
right.
Because yes,

1321
01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:02.500
it's interesting with porn you're doing most intimate thing,

1322
01:24:02.501 --> 01:24:06.310
but it has so little intimacy in it,
you know.
And uh,

1323
01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:10.630
it's for people who are consuming it with PR personnel issues,
a lot of them,

1324
01:24:10.631 --> 01:24:13.420
you know,
and like if you're one of those people to watch every once in a while,

1325
01:24:13.690 --> 01:24:16.270
fine.
But if you always need it,

1326
01:24:16.330 --> 01:24:20.560
it's because there's something wrong with you.

1327
01:24:22.330 --> 01:24:23.470
I'm not attacking the business.

1328
01:24:24.630 --> 01:24:27.580
What do you think what you're saying is intuitive?
It's like you're,
you're,

1329
01:24:27.581 --> 01:24:32.581
you're spot on drug addiction or alcohol or porn or that the interview is about

1330
01:24:34.811 --> 01:24:36.420
the documentary,
cause I remember that we,

1331
01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:41.480
we read it on the show that he had retired from performing and then he was,

1332
01:24:42.611 --> 01:24:47.370
you know,
but that he was still going to hookers three times a day.
That's a,

1333
01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:50.650
and that his wife at some point I was like,
just go back to shooting again.

1334
01:24:50.651 --> 01:24:55.190
This is crazy.
It's not unlike a orgasm.
There's some,
some,

1335
01:24:55.510 --> 01:25:00.070
I'm sure there's some kind of trauma that you learn to sex or drugs or whatever

1336
01:25:00.071 --> 01:25:04.660
to give you a comfort,
you know?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
The traumas for sure.

1337
01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:08.470
Yeah.
That's why I think,
um,
one of the director Johnny Darko,

1338
01:25:08.471 --> 01:25:12.010
he's always like shocked.
Like,
I know you guys,
he's such a big fan.
Look,

1339
01:25:12.670 --> 01:25:13.810
I think you'll get it.
Okay.

1340
01:25:14.570 --> 01:25:16.670
<v 3>Oh,
this is going to be in Italian with French</v>

1341
01:25:18.510 --> 01:25:21.510
called Rocco.
And I kept bugging out.

1342
01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:28.330
Okay.
1500,

1343
01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:35.930
500,000.
The

1344
01:25:37.670 --> 01:25:41.480
appropriate
security,

1345
01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:43.083
they

1346
01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:50.570
go to work for me.
Now what they say

1347
01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:58.030
<v 6>and why you can
start</v>

1348
01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:04.100
right away.
But there were,
there was a funny

1349
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:06.740
<v 15>scene where one of the girls that my dad is a big fan of yours,</v>

1350
01:26:06.741 --> 01:26:09.980
really think he's started fucking her and like,
okay,

1351
01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:11.570
and he's fucking a dog is down now.

1352
01:26:11.571 --> 01:26:14.480
Look at the camera and say hi to your daddy and Nike's fucking her and like
that.

1353
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:16.420
So he,
he,
um,

1354
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:26.150
did you see any hookers and Antwerp?
You're saying I find a new place.

1355
01:26:26.210 --> 01:26:30.260
I was really shocked.
Oh,
so please do tell.
Okay.

1356
01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:32.000
Does it does even shocking to me.

1357
01:26:32.150 --> 01:26:36.350
So I finished the show working with June.
Fantastic.

1358
01:26:36.351 --> 01:26:40.880
He was great at the audience of wonderful and talk about your fans.

1359
01:26:41.570 --> 01:26:42.440
You got your fence,

1360
01:26:42.441 --> 01:26:46.310
listen to this show because there's so much intimacy and make people really

1361
01:26:46.311 --> 01:26:49.340
happy.
I'm like I was saying Johnny Darko,
one of the director,

1362
01:26:49.341 --> 01:26:52.670
he's a big fan of yours and like he was really happy to him on the shoulder
time.

1363
01:26:52.670 --> 01:26:56.330
So anyway,
great job for the,
um,
after the,

1364
01:26:56.331 --> 01:26:59.570
after that comedy tour I flew into Athens,

1365
01:26:59.571 --> 01:27:02.630
Greece because one of my friend was working at the refugee camp.

1366
01:27:02.631 --> 01:27:07.460
So they live these people just fuck a refugee.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,

1367
01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:11.480
no.
But it's funny you say that because I do have some,
um,

1368
01:27:11.570 --> 01:27:13.580
so there's a place go city plaza hotel.

1369
01:27:13.610 --> 01:27:17.600
It was abandoned and a pro refugee group took it over.

1370
01:27:18.110 --> 01:27:21.260
I don't know how many,
maybe 500,
800 refugee people living there.

1371
01:27:21.261 --> 01:27:25.700
And my friend was working there as a volunteer and,
um,
when I showed up,
uh,

1372
01:27:25.770 --> 01:27:28.910
he was known he timing was bad so he couldn't be there.

1373
01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:34.730
So I just kind of walked around,
check it out.
And um,
rob,
rob,
rob,

1374
01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:38.930
I guess.
Yeah,
to city,
the city of Athens,

1375
01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:41.210
they don't want to deal with the refugee problem.

1376
01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:46.160
So they have a lot of refugees already.
Yeah.
Albanians are there.
And Syrians,

1377
01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:48.410
again,
fucking Gypsies.

1378
01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:54.160
Oh you sound like a northern Europe dinner and they treat them real bad so they

1379
01:27:56.781 --> 01:27:57.800
don't want to acknowledge it.

1380
01:27:58.130 --> 01:28:01.880
And the people who run it don't want to bother the city either because they're

1381
01:28:01.881 --> 01:28:03.770
so,
they're pretending it's not happening.
So anyway,

1382
01:28:03.771 --> 01:28:06.020
I kind of went there even though my friend wasn't there,

1383
01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:09.020
check it out and they're doing good job,

1384
01:28:09.290 --> 01:28:11.960
but it just shows like even if I have a good intention,

1385
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:13.610
my mind go to the dark places.
Right.

1386
01:28:13.611 --> 01:28:17.840
Cause I saw really good looking Syrian girls walking and then what pops in my

1387
01:28:17.841 --> 01:28:21.060
head was I wanted to show,
give me a blowjob for hot dog.
Right.

1388
01:28:21.061 --> 01:28:25.050
Then the hot dog thing because there were,
I didn't do anything Tom,
but,

1389
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:29.740
but those thoughts,
sue entered my mind.
I do not blame you for those thoughts.

1390
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:32.810
I think those are normal thoughts.
I don't,
you just don't do it.
Don't do it.
Yeah,

1391
01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:37.550
you just don't do it.
Or you think she blamed me for a hot dog.
I think that on a,

1392
01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:41.330
on a regular basis,
like at the grocery store,
I'll be like,

1393
01:28:41.331 --> 01:28:42.320
I wonder if I got her groceries.

1394
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:45.230
She gave me a blowjob in the parking lot or something like that.
Anyways.

1395
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:49.730
But you didn't see any actual prostitutes paid for?
No,
but in Athens,

1396
01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:54.080
I didn't know that prostitution is legal.
So,

1397
01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:56.690
um,
I was there for three days.

1398
01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:01.650
So by lay first night I was bored because it's hot.

1399
01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:06.550
And then I just said,
did an internet search,
did not find out that

1400
01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:12.420
instead of red light district,
it's called why light district white light.

1401
01:29:12.450 --> 01:29:17.130
So it's called wildlife district.
So prostitution legal,
but you can't have a,

1402
01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:19.350
um,
pimp representing you,

1403
01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:24.500
but it's legal and unemployment for young people between 18 through 30 is

1404
01:29:25.891 --> 01:29:27.270
hovering almost 50%.

1405
01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:32.550
<v 6>Jesus.
That's terrible.
But it's great for prostitution.
Yes.</v>

1406
01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:34.860
So we should go there.

1407
01:29:35.550 --> 01:29:40.550
So I get someone to piss on my balls and put a baseball bat and her ass for you

1408
01:29:42.001 --> 01:29:45.510
like you like wow.
That sounds like Bella Donna.
Um,
it is like Bella.
Donna.

1409
01:29:45.511 --> 01:29:48.870
That's exactly what I was thinking of.
I like her.
She's great.

1410
01:29:48.871 --> 01:29:52.050
I've met her before.
This is the most pro porn podcast.

1411
01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:55.280
Christina's version of who?
My second wife.

1412
01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:58.680
She thinks that that I'll be over the family thing and I'd be like,

1413
01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:02.240
I just want some chick to piss on my balls.
Yeah.
Wait,
wait.

1414
01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:06.110
Is that something you're really into?
No,
no.
No.
Okay.
She thinks it's a rip,

1415
01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:10.110
like it's more of a metaphor for like letting out.

1416
01:30:10.111 --> 01:30:12.570
Whatever's repressed because I'm a family guy now.

1417
01:30:13.410 --> 01:30:15.720
I just feel like you're going to get also the fame.

1418
01:30:15.721 --> 01:30:20.220
We'll get to you and the banality of your everyday existence will weigh on you

1419
01:30:20.250 --> 01:30:23.010
and see where it,
and then you'll,
you'll be like,

1420
01:30:23.011 --> 01:30:24.420
I just want someone to pee on my balls,

1421
01:30:24.421 --> 01:30:28.890
but I can't ask my wife because I'm cheating.
Of course.
Wait,
what?

1422
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.520
Peter's balls is cheating.
Why?
Why?

1423
01:30:32.521 --> 01:30:36.540
If you see someone's coach and somebody says it's a girl,

1424
01:30:39.230 --> 01:30:42.780
she mails.
Would they be upset?
That will be even more upsetting.

1425
01:30:42.781 --> 01:30:47.430
I think really well cause it's both.
Both a sexist cheating.

1426
01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:50.790
It's like a superhuman pee on my ball.

1427
01:30:50.810 --> 01:30:54.720
No Babe,
can I have someone pee on my vagina?

1428
01:30:55.530 --> 01:30:59.550
Yeah.
No,
it's fun.
Ips On my tank.

1429
01:31:00.010 --> 01:31:05.000
If that's what you like,
go for it.
I figured like if that,

1430
01:31:05.001 --> 01:31:09.620
if that's all they need to do,
then you're probably in your happy.
I'd be like,

1431
01:31:09.650 --> 01:31:13.290
good,
go get that piece.
Go get that p you want on your taste so bad.

1432
01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:18.740
You know in Athens I was there 10 15 years ago now and the dudes were holding

1433
01:31:18.741 --> 01:31:22.400
hands.
They still do that.
I didn't see that.

1434
01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:25.730
That's a Middle Eastern Muslim.
That's where maybe that was it.
Yeah.

1435
01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:29.620
Maybe I saw those dudes and they carry their beads around and the handholding.

1436
01:31:30.490 --> 01:31:35.300
<v 15>Yeah,
they did.
They have a very weird notion of personal space,
but it,</v>

1437
01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:40.180
but with men.
With men,
but they don't like when a women with a man,

1438
01:31:40.210 --> 01:31:41.530
unless you're married or something.

1439
01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:45.160
<v 6>Yeah.
It's very good.
The Muslim world.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

1440
01:31:45.190 --> 01:31:47.710
but no hookers and Antwerp,
you're saying?

1441
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:50.810
<v 15>Oh No,
I got to,
yeah.
Well let's talk about those.
No,</v>

1442
01:31:50.811 --> 01:31:54.270
but the aunt Athens is amazing because while I districts,

1443
01:31:54.271 --> 01:31:57.840
so basically you go into this certain streets that they tow it there illegal,

1444
01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:01.600
you walk down the street,
even during the daytime they had this really tiny,

1445
01:32:01.601 --> 01:32:02.740
bright white light.

1446
01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:07.380
That means there's a prostitute there and the doors are wrapped with this,
uh,
um,

1447
01:32:07.410 --> 01:32:12.100
um,
cloth.
So when,
when you close the door doesn't slam the door.
So you go in,

1448
01:32:12.150 --> 01:32:15.730
it's all,
you go in,
it looks like a disco room.

1449
01:32:15.731 --> 01:32:18.880
What this shiny things are going in a circle.
Like,
wow,
this is weird.

1450
01:32:19.090 --> 01:32:22.980
You sit down and usually there's another guy said into,

1451
01:32:22.981 --> 01:32:26.010
so you're standing there and waiting for a long time.
And that cousin in Athens,

1452
01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:29.680
Athens,
so like,
but like what,
what does it happen?
What happened?
And this is so,

1453
01:32:29.681 --> 01:32:32.310
it's such a strange then,
then,
then Dave literally,

1454
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:36.040
literally cold their Mama Zone.
So she'll,
they're all women while in okay.

1455
01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:40.240
And she'll speak.
If she see a foreigner,
then she'll speak in Greek and English.

1456
01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:45.280
She said normal sex only.
I don't know what that means.

1457
01:32:46.030 --> 01:32:50.290
Normal sex.
10 year olds.
Like what the fuck?
What?

1458
01:32:50.410 --> 01:32:54.880
10 Euros.
If you don't know the cheese at 10 year olds?
No,
no,
no.
10 year old.

1459
01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:59.140
<v 6>Yeah.
No,
no,
no.
It's what,</v>

1460
01:32:59.490 --> 01:33:03.650
how much is it now?
$11 10 50 $10 and 50 cents.

1461
01:33:03.870 --> 01:33:05.520
That's how bad the euro is.
I didn't,

1462
01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:09.290
<v 15>so wait a minute.
How did you close it back up?
How'd you end up at this place?</v>

1463
01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:12.400
Like how do,
how does,
how do you end up there?
They said that,

1464
01:33:13.100 --> 01:33:16.270
I don't remember the name of that Shit.
They said like this,

1465
01:33:16.290 --> 01:33:19.340
these are the couple of streets are there.
They're legal to go.
Oh,
okay.

1466
01:33:19.370 --> 01:33:22.220
So I walked down the street,
but there's no science in hookers.
Right.
Right.

1467
01:33:22.221 --> 01:33:25.610
Even if even if it did,
then it's in Greek so I can read that.
Yeah.

1468
01:33:25.670 --> 01:33:27.110
So as I started walking,

1469
01:33:27.111 --> 01:33:30.210
like after awhile you start seeing only guys in the neighborhood.
Yeah.

1470
01:33:30.230 --> 01:33:32.960
I think going back and forth to these rooms,
like,
oh,
um,

1471
01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:37.610
so I noticed a pattern like white lights,
middle doors with the cloth.

1472
01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:40.280
So when he slammed me,
it doesn't make a lot of towns.
So I opened the door,

1473
01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:44.000
I go in and it's like a disco.
Right,
right.
So when the,

1474
01:33:44.001 --> 01:33:48.290
then she said when after she said 10 euros,
normal sex,
then what?

1475
01:33:48.530 --> 01:33:53.210
Then a girl walks in across the room from one door to another and you see them

1476
01:33:53.211 --> 01:33:57.140
for a second.
Oh,
so you get to it like I have all the goods.
Yeah.

1477
01:33:57.170 --> 01:34:01.130
And um,
the first one that I went there,

1478
01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:05.660
I mean she must've been 60 years old and old.
Like,
what the fuck?

1479
01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:08.660
I'm not doing this.
So like as I'm leaving,

1480
01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:12.760
she was assistant to gimme a kiss,
like being friendly.
Like I don't mean,

1481
01:34:12.770 --> 01:34:16.820
I don't want to be rude,
but she was so friendly,
but like,
you know,
she,

1482
01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:19.760
I was just making funny faces.
She came and just kissing me in the lip.
Like,

1483
01:34:19.790 --> 01:34:20.623
oh my God,

1484
01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:24.720
<v 6>just talking about that.
When strangers wanting to kiss you on the mouth,</v>

1485
01:34:24.721 --> 01:34:26.580
like they time you want to,
I'm not even

1486
01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:30.400
<v 15>j a romantic thing and some people do,
but she wasn't being nasty.</v>

1487
01:34:30.401 --> 01:34:34.220
But she was [inaudible] I don't want to hurt her feelings because she's
probably,

1488
01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:37.890
it doesn't make unless you're into like older,
overweight.
Wait,

1489
01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:42.430
was that your only option?
No,
no,
no,
no.
So I left there,
but I was like,
Oh man,

1490
01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:44.020
this is,
I don't know if I want to do this,

1491
01:34:44.021 --> 01:34:47.610
but there's so many rooms and so many buildings,
so I just walk everyone.

1492
01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:51.890
And then eventually I went to,
I went to one door and um,
she was pretty,

1493
01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:56.920
so like I still that it's a scam because,
okay,
10 year olds,

1494
01:34:57.260 --> 01:35:00.350
but once you go in,
she going to say,
okay,
if you want this now the five,

1495
01:35:00.351 --> 01:35:04.070
if you want,
that's another 20.
That's what I thought.
And then,
um,

1496
01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:08.090
so if the guy doesn't like the girl,
they leave and they go to another building.

1497
01:35:08.090 --> 01:35:12.050
So like,
okay,
I like that one.
So like I'll pay for this one.

1498
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:14.930
And um,
I get,
uh,

1499
01:35:15.110 --> 01:35:18.560
give the old lady 10 year olds and then,
um,
she grabbed me,

1500
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:23.590
took me to this room and it's like a room with very basic furniture's with bed.

1501
01:35:24.050 --> 01:35:28.910
So you're just setting and every once in a while you hear high heel walking by.

1502
01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:33.320
So she's going back and forth and I guess every building with one door,

1503
01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:37.550
one girl only.
So he's just way on channel term.
Oh Man.

1504
01:35:37.570 --> 01:35:40.910
So you just wait and I think I weighed like half an hour for this one and she

1505
01:35:40.911 --> 01:35:45.020
came in and um,
we'll describe her.
She is

1506
01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:50.630
eastern European but I think she was a little darker,

1507
01:35:50.631 --> 01:35:54.680
so I think she's probably like Bulgarian or something.

1508
01:35:54.681 --> 01:35:57.530
One of those or Macedonia or something like that.
And um,

1509
01:35:57.590 --> 01:36:01.250
she didn't speak a whole lot of English,
but she,
she,
she relatively like,

1510
01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:04.300
I dunno,
late twenties are there,

1511
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:07.040
who needs this make a lot of English when you're just making sweet love though,

1512
01:36:07.041 --> 01:36:11.180
right.
That's free lap.
She'd say 10 minutes,
normal sex and like,
oh,
they didn't,

1513
01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:14.660
you know,
like taking like you have to finish with everything by 10 minutes,

1514
01:36:14.661 --> 01:36:17.720
you know.
But if she says that like that's what she leads with.
Yeah.

1515
01:36:17.721 --> 01:36:21.800
Because if it's crazy,
I'm sure she learns to speak to them in Greek or whatever.

1516
01:36:21.801 --> 01:36:24.080
But um,
yeah,
it,
it,
I was shocked.

1517
01:36:24.110 --> 01:36:27.500
It's only 10 euro fall that I could not believe.

1518
01:36:27.890 --> 01:36:32.240
And if you look you could find gem and um,
there's other ones.

1519
01:36:32.241 --> 01:36:36.050
Then after a while you see a really pretty ones,
but they all have rules.
Like,
no,

1520
01:36:36.051 --> 01:36:40.580
let gain though this and that ate the ass and pussy all the time.
I got nothing.

1521
01:36:40.610 --> 01:36:44.270
So did you get to do that though or no?
Um,
some of the gross won't let you do it.

1522
01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:48.500
Really?
Yeah.
But happy to compliant 10 euros though.
Yeah,
true.

1523
01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:53.830
I mean 10 years you get maybe a couple of dances that you are actually having a

1524
01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:58.370
blow job and then a couple of possession,
10 minutes.
Good for you.

1525
01:36:58.371 --> 01:37:00.940
As I was enough.
I mean it's,
if tenure,
you can't complain,

1526
01:37:00.941 --> 01:37:04.620
so you just got to finish it as you know.
I know.
I just like doing it.

1527
01:37:04.621 --> 01:37:07.470
They just like,
just like doing stand up,
you know,

1528
01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:09.860
you know when the red lights you have two minutes ago,

1529
01:37:10.770 --> 01:37:14.900
if he paid her 20 zero cause you double your time or is that not even an option?

1530
01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:20.710
You could pay somebody for like 64 whole hour if you want it to.

1531
01:37:22.230 --> 01:37:25.750
But there's,
but there's other streets,
it's like gross a 20 year olds.

1532
01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:30.230
There's others,
the studio and like fucking for 10 times.

1533
01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:34.940
And then did you have to wear a condom?
Was that Oh yeah.
God,
I hope so.

1534
01:37:35.690 --> 01:37:40.190
I mean,
here's the thing.
Anything is negotiable.

1535
01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:43.770
If you say you want to pay them 104 no condoms,
I mean the,

1536
01:37:44.010 --> 01:37:48.860
you will find a girl who will do it.
That is a crazy gamble or,
or,
or,
or,

1537
01:37:49.010 --> 01:37:52.940
um,
but it's $100.
They ain't know what I mean.
Or,
um,

1538
01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:57.990
no condom.
Blowjobs or,
you know.
Yeah.
I mean depends,

1539
01:37:57.991 --> 01:38:01.230
but everything's negotiable,
you know,
and,
and,

1540
01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:04.380
but a lot of the girls are telling me there's guys that don't want to have sex

1541
01:38:04.381 --> 01:38:05.900
and just want to spend with a time with a group.

1542
01:38:06.450 --> 01:38:09.220
<v 5>Those are the guys I would take if I were a prostitute.
I mean,</v>

1543
01:38:09.221 --> 01:38:12.130
just give me your lonely.
Yeah.
Or snuggling

1544
01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:16.260
<v 15>or some other girls in like,
oh,
she had to do is watch him eat for like an hour</v>

1545
01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:18.880
<v 5>eating.
Yeah.
What about farting?</v>

1546
01:38:18.881 --> 01:38:23.030
Have you encountered anybody that just wants a girl to Fart or,
yeah,

1547
01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:26.750
<v 0>let's talk about it.
Where did,
where did you encounter that?</v>

1548
01:38:26.910 --> 01:38:28.800
<v 15>I mean,
I talked to,
I mean,</v>

1549
01:38:28.801 --> 01:38:33.600
when I get to know that some of the girls still tell me weird stuff or date.
The,

1550
01:38:33.730 --> 01:38:37.530
another big thing is like,
they like gross sitting on cake and shit like that.

1551
01:38:37.531 --> 01:38:37.740
Okay.

1552
01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:40.260
<v 5>Farts.
Okay.
Or just sitting.
Just sitting on food.
Yeah.</v>

1553
01:38:40.270 --> 01:38:45.140
Tom and I have started a website called fart mistress where we would lose Breo.

1554
01:38:45.610 --> 01:38:49.930
Yes.
Israel.
Uh,
we're not sure how we're going to get

1555
01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:52.360
this to happen,

1556
01:38:52.390 --> 01:38:56.140
but we've come across the spark videos where it's just girls farting and there's

1557
01:38:56.141 --> 01:39:00.430
nothing sexual happening.
Like,
do you know girls that do fart videos?

1558
01:39:00.580 --> 01:39:02.890
Like they just fart for like $100 or,

1559
01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:05.490
<v 15>I mean if you paid them deal with do with any,
right,
but just,</v>

1560
01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:07.420
I don't know any like you,

1561
01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:11.290
if you're asking me like certain girls have for prolapse and certain girls are

1562
01:39:11.291 --> 01:39:15.270
doing for a strip strap attack,
um,

1563
01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:19.030
sharp on attack.
I mean there's some girls a name attached to certain fetish,

1564
01:39:19.330 --> 01:39:21.810
but I don't know any famous girl interrupted

1565
01:39:22.010 --> 01:39:22.591
<v 9>how is in the,</v>

1566
01:39:22.591 --> 01:39:27.591
everything just dying was dropped and masturbating when his penis has dropped

1567
01:39:28.081 --> 01:39:31.470
and he slaps it on his belly.
They call that masturbation for stallions.

1568
01:39:32.250 --> 01:39:36.570
And so I just,
I,
one thing led to another and I couldn't resist,

1569
01:39:36.571 --> 01:39:39.210
so I bet down and started sucking on him.

1570
01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:40.740
<v 0>That's right.
Horse.</v>

1571
01:39:43.930 --> 01:39:46.860
<v 9>Hey,
this documentary.
Then he tried climbing on top of me.</v>

1572
01:39:46.861 --> 01:39:49.890
So the next thing I know my pants are down and I'm bending over for him and I'm

1573
01:39:49.891 --> 01:39:51.480
like,
excuse me,
I can't resist.

1574
01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:57.130
<v 0>Hmm.
Uh,</v>

1575
01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:02.000
a guy who was the guy that worked for Boeing got killed in his day.
That's right.

1576
01:40:02.010 --> 01:40:03.830
That was that documentary was about that.

1577
01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:05.820
<v 9>Yeah.
Good.
Excuse me.
I can't resist.</v>

1578
01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:12.660
<v 0>Yeah,
you shouldn't fuck with animals.
They'd write and can't give consent.</v>

1579
01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:15.960
I don't think that's fair.
Yeah.
They can't say anything.

1580
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:19.500
We haven't discussed this yet.
Are Kelly posted?
You know,
he's in some shit now.

1581
01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:22.710
Well,
he's always in shit.
Yeah.
He,
this,
you know,

1582
01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:28.180
he's somebody who has really been able to navigate the horrible press.

1583
01:40:28.501 --> 01:40:31.650
Probably better than most.
I mean,

1584
01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:36.600
I remember the either the Chicago Tribune or the Sun Times did this expo is a,

1585
01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:38.620
a while ago.
Yeah.

1586
01:40:38.670 --> 01:40:43.560
Really laying out all the complaints that were in a Chicago courthouse.

1587
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:47.430
Basically every filing that's ever been made as a complaint on him.

1588
01:40:47.431 --> 01:40:48.930
And it was like,
they were like,
look,

1589
01:40:48.931 --> 01:40:53.800
this is the record setting number that then that,
that didn't get any attention.

1590
01:40:53.950 --> 01:40:54.280
Everybody

1591
01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:57.580
<v 6>always knew about that video with the pissing and,</v>

1592
01:40:57.860 --> 01:41:01.960
well don't you think it has a lot to also to do with the victims.

1593
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:06.280
They are victims but there are black women,
black women who are usually,

1594
01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:10.660
and they're young teens are not like talking about if,
if the narrative was,

1595
01:41:10.661 --> 01:41:13.720
if it was a young white girl,
I think,
I think reaction,

1596
01:41:13.721 --> 01:41:17.500
we've quite different at any ski.

1597
01:41:17.501 --> 01:41:20.650
Never pretend like it was a wholesome family guy either.
No.

1598
01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:23.980
Well here this is not,
hey it's fucking talented.
I don't like like he does.

1599
01:41:24.610 --> 01:41:26.770
He is unbelievable.
Those,
those lyrics.

1600
01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:31.610
Now they're saying that he's got women hold up in different houses and that's

1601
01:41:31.611 --> 01:41:32.190
bizarre.

1602
01:41:32.190 --> 01:41:37.190
Takes away their phones and just basically keeps them and tells them when to eat

1603
01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:41.940
window babe when you know it's like it's,
it's pretty nuts.
This is the,

1604
01:41:41.941 --> 01:41:44.980
the latest accusation.
This is separate from that.
But this is,

1605
01:41:45.450 --> 01:41:50.090
<v 16>and I would drink from her lipstick car because,</v>

1606
01:41:50.810 --> 01:41:52.970
and a son my,
the way I had a serious,

1607
01:41:52.971 --> 01:41:57.050
serious crush on my mom because she could sing her butt off.
Okay.

1608
01:41:57.051 --> 01:42:00.740
So you had a crush and I just looked up and down to her.
I looked around,

1609
01:42:00.741 --> 01:42:05.670
I looked everything about my mother,
you know,
I loved,

1610
01:42:05.671 --> 01:42:10.560
um hmm.
And I even asked her to marry me one day.
I was like,
Nah.

1611
01:42:10.590 --> 01:42:14.710
She said no,
but you know what?
I understood it.
I understood,

1612
01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:18.340
<v 6>but don't you think he's being very honest about it?</v>

1613
01:42:18.370 --> 01:42:22.290
I think it is just like the gays.
Um,

1614
01:42:23.410 --> 01:42:27.370
cause remember I think last time I told you at the live show asked him,

1615
01:42:27.371 --> 01:42:31.830
will you ever date your mom?
Yeah,
yeah.

1616
01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:37.550
That when I did your live show,
um,
you know,

1617
01:42:37.570 --> 01:42:40.180
porn have incredible ability to predict what's gonna be next president.

1618
01:42:40.181 --> 01:42:44.420
But Trump,
I think I kind of admire him being so honest about,

1619
01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:45.440
you know,
the,

1620
01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:49.850
the new trend is taboo relations or incest porn or those sorts of really popular

1621
01:42:49.851 --> 01:42:54.260
right now.
And you're saying,
I think that,
I mean the way he was talking about,
oh,

1622
01:42:54.261 --> 01:42:57.590
his daughter.
Yeah.
Like if she,
if she wasn't my daughter over day her,
you know,

1623
01:42:57.620 --> 01:42:58.453
but uh,
yeah.

1624
01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:00.600
<v 16>And I even asked her to marry me,</v>

1625
01:43:01.390 --> 01:43:05.140
<v 6>asked him,
were you ever date your mom?
The incest,
anyone this show.</v>

1626
01:43:05.210 --> 01:43:08.800
It's really another level.
But he really was,

1627
01:43:08.801 --> 01:43:12.460
I mean I understand what you're saying is kind of creepy the way that Trump

1628
01:43:12.461 --> 01:43:13.720
talks about it,
but it is I guess,

1629
01:43:13.721 --> 01:43:18.721
honest to kits on both sexist go through that in the Freud even talked about

1630
01:43:19.391 --> 01:43:23.680
that,
right.
Oedipus complex but also girls for their father.
You just,

1631
01:43:23.681 --> 01:43:25.780
when you reach a certain age you just outgrow that.

1632
01:43:25.781 --> 01:43:30.330
But some people obviously don't,
you know,
I think Levi Strauss,

1633
01:43:30.331 --> 01:43:32.170
the philosopher or entrepreneur,

1634
01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:37.500
that whole notion of taboo started with the whole idea of taboo and not have sex

1635
01:43:37.721 --> 01:43:40.370
with family related.
You know,
cause um,

1636
01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:43.030
because before then it wasn't I guess a big deal.

1637
01:43:43.090 --> 01:43:46.490
I mean people married cousins all the time,
like royal family.
It's,

1638
01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:50.580
some cultures still really marry their cousins.
Yeah.

1639
01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:53.540
<v 15>FDR,
you know,
I mean there are four to five,</v>

1640
01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:59.050
remove your something,
but they're nevertheless family.
And uh,

1641
01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:04.310
I remember reading this article one time in England when I was visiting.
Um,

1642
01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:06.650
there was a nuclear plant or something.

1643
01:44:06.651 --> 01:44:10.460
You're one of the cities in England and they were having all kinds of,
uh,

1644
01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:14.360
medical and biological problem with like,
um,
data.

1645
01:44:14.361 --> 01:44:16.400
It was some kind of radiation leak or something,

1646
01:44:16.401 --> 01:44:20.960
but when they did a little bit memory research,
they find out it was like incest,

1647
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:25.400
um,
you know,
just family members having sex with each other.

1648
01:44:25.401 --> 01:44:29.180
It wasn't a nuclear plant.
So it happened more often than you think it does.

1649
01:44:29.181 --> 01:44:31.700
And in look at Utah,
there is a renegade Mormons,

1650
01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:34.100
the Mormon Church Jetson not condone it,

1651
01:44:34.101 --> 01:44:37.490
but there are people still multiple wives and you know,

1652
01:44:37.491 --> 01:44:39.080
there's all these weird things that happened.

1653
01:44:39.810 --> 01:44:42.620
<v 6>I don't get it.
I mean like as,
as a parent now,</v>

1654
01:44:42.710 --> 01:44:46.520
like that's the fucking last thing I could even fathom is like,

1655
01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:48.110
it's just not on the table.

1656
01:44:48.230 --> 01:44:52.400
It's looking for a lot of health problems with that health problems,
with the,

1657
01:44:52.401 --> 01:44:56.900
with the genetic problem,
you know,
with,
with,
actually I heard the,

1658
01:44:56.901 --> 01:45:00.800
I heard cousins are okay,
I did professor in college.
I did,
I did.

1659
01:45:00.801 --> 01:45:04.960
I had a professor in college say that cousin fucking is not,
uh,

1660
01:45:05.150 --> 01:45:07.460
it's not the genetic mutations.
It's,

1661
01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:09.940
it's immediate like when you're going farther

1662
01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:13.440
<v 0>or jotters genetic problems with cousin's cousin.
Fucking definitely.</v>

1663
01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:17.000
Well definitely we'll have to see you look,
look at the studies.

1664
01:45:17.001 --> 01:45:22.001
There's loose studies out there about the cultures that have the most cousin

1665
01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:28.810
marriages and reproduction and is just ramp and health problems and,

1666
01:45:28.830 --> 01:45:30.230
and just like dogs,

1667
01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:35.460
<v 6>same thing and just cross breeding,
breeding and inbreeding and yeah,
and I think,</v>

1668
01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:40.160
<v 15>was it Germany?
There was a case where these fraternity brothers,</v>

1669
01:45:40.161 --> 01:45:40.941
sisters separated.

1670
01:45:40.941 --> 01:45:45.650
They didn't even know other existed and some at some really weird coincidence

1671
01:45:45.651 --> 01:45:46.550
against their met,

1672
01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:51.320
never knew they were related and they start having a relationship and you know,

1673
01:45:51.630 --> 01:45:56.050
uh,
yeah.
What are you doing that situation?
I mean it's a sexy story,
but yeah,

1674
01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:59.630
<v 6>still
it's a very sexy story.</v>

1675
01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:02.070
I go retarded retarded at that point.

1676
01:46:02.210 --> 01:46:05.130
I'd rather be retarded then have sex with my brother.

1677
01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:07.440
[inaudible] would you rather,
how about

1678
01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:12.300
<v 0>this though?
Sorry,
this is regards to the last podcast,
this email.
Hey Hitler.</v>

1679
01:46:12.330 --> 01:46:14.460
During the opening episode of four Oh five,

1680
01:46:14.850 --> 01:46:18.300
you guys discussed the pleasure of orgasmic birth as a man.

1681
01:46:18.301 --> 01:46:20.680
I have no idea what childbirth feels like,
Bro.

1682
01:46:20.730 --> 01:46:24.630
I'm willing to take these women's word for how great childbirth feels.

1683
01:46:25.130 --> 01:46:27.360
Christina has tried to shoot down the idea,

1684
01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:30.740
but I feel like it's more likely that it's something is wrong with her.
Okay.

1685
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:34.740
And these ladies are all lying.
Maybe horrible personality.

1686
01:46:35.110 --> 01:46:40.110
Is it a hindrance to the pleasure or possibly was her lack of hydration that led

1687
01:46:40.411 --> 01:46:45.210
to the painful experience?
Love the palm cash.
Okay.
Burnt his fat.
Nate.

1688
01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:49.980
Thanks Nate.
So well,
why don't you squeeze a out of your Dick Hall

1689
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:54.690
<v 6>and we'll talk about it.
Yeah,
I mean it was pure pain,
right?
Yeah.
Dude,</v>

1690
01:46:54.691 --> 01:46:55.860
there's no,
listen,

1691
01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:59.160
these fucking dirty hippies are trying to say that a woman can have an orgasm

1692
01:46:59.161 --> 01:47:01.260
during childbirth.
Uh,
you know,

1693
01:47:01.261 --> 01:47:03.960
I have yet to meet a woman that that's really happened too.

1694
01:47:03.961 --> 01:47:07.620
I guess in theory it's possible,
but it ain't fucking probable.
I mean,

1695
01:47:07.621 --> 01:47:10.950
it is excrutiatingly painful and I had a fucking epidural and they could still

1696
01:47:10.951 --> 01:47:14.100
feel it.
So no,
nothing sexy.
Yeah.

1697
01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:16.270
<v 0>[inaudible] um,</v>

1698
01:47:16.570 --> 01:47:19.900
somebody email about male to female pilots.

1699
01:47:21.130 --> 01:47:25.450
Hey Champs.
I heard you guys speculating on the female pilot situation.

1700
01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:28.580
Could we talked about uh,
uh,

1701
01:47:28.630 --> 01:47:33.160
flight I was on female was the yes.
And they said my spouse,

1702
01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:36.550
please use pronouns.
Pay Turd.

1703
01:47:36.551 --> 01:47:41.551
Tim and I was informed Taytay sees at least a couple applications each week for

1704
01:47:43.781 --> 01:47:47.740
a new pilots license due to a gender change.
Oh Shit.

1705
01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:52.060
And considering Tay is one of four people that handle these,

1706
01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:56.200
there has to be a pretty substantial amount of pilots that have changed their

1707
01:47:56.201 --> 01:48:00.370
gender.
Oh Wow.
Just thought you might like some verification on that point.

1708
01:48:00.470 --> 01:48:03.750
That's great week mommy,
your newest,
coolest fan.
Levi.
Okay.

1709
01:48:03.820 --> 01:48:08.320
<v 6>Wait.
You know,
right away when you said it first,
a male to female po whatever.</v>

1710
01:48:08.620 --> 01:48:11.970
I thought there was some kind of new sexual position so I was confused for

1711
01:48:14.420 --> 01:48:14.700
okay.

1712
01:48:14.700 --> 01:48:17.520
<v 0>Yeah,
I know.
Female.
Um,</v>

1713
01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:22.530
well I knows this says that Garth fucked up Ireland.

1714
01:48:22.890 --> 01:48:26.550
Oh yeah,
yeah.
Um,
this person wrote,
hey jeans.

1715
01:48:26.551 --> 01:48:31.440
I love the Wheeler Walker Jr podcasts,
the live songs with great idea.
Uh,

1716
01:48:31.470 --> 01:48:33.780
your conversation about Garth being a moron.

1717
01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:38.010
I wanted to draw attention what happened a while back when g tried to play

1718
01:48:38.011 --> 01:48:42.700
Ireland's largest sports stadium Croke Park Wa I want to let you know that

1719
01:48:42.930 --> 01:48:45.960
Brooks is huge and in Ireland,

1720
01:48:45.961 --> 01:48:50.450
especially with mums and rural fork,
rural folk,
excuse me.
Uh,

1721
01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:55.500
the announcement of the gigs was a big deal.
Kid not played her 17 years.
Wow.

1722
01:48:56.190 --> 01:48:56.641
Personally,

1723
01:48:56.641 --> 01:48:59.940
I think his music is uttered cripe and maybe slightly good if you're really

1724
01:48:59.941 --> 01:49:03.030
hammered at a wedding,
the promoters and Garth teen book,

1725
01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:05.460
five consecutive nights in the stadium,

1726
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:07.650
something which has never happened before.

1727
01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:11.050
Tickets for a release and sold out immediately.
Wow.

1728
01:49:11.070 --> 01:49:14.610
All 400,000 of them.
Oh my God.

1729
01:49:14.820 --> 01:49:19.650
The stadium is in a densely populated residential area and concerts often cause

1730
01:49:19.651 --> 01:49:23.190
of major disruption.
For this reason,
there is a rule,

1731
01:49:23.370 --> 01:49:27.000
no more than three concerts can happen in a row and one week within the stadium

1732
01:49:27.210 --> 01:49:29.040
when this was announced by the council and government,

1733
01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:33.750
Garth responded by pulling all the show what Santa does,

1734
01:49:33.810 --> 01:49:35.430
saying it's all or none.

1735
01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:40.410
It basically caused a national emergency shit.

1736
01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:42.040
The Irish prime minister,

1737
01:49:42.060 --> 01:49:45.900
tee shot ended up having to make a statement in parliament about the whole

1738
01:49:45.901 --> 01:49:50.800
fiasco.
It was all anyone talked about.
He acted like a total total spoiled Brat.

1739
01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:52.540
Everyone here was appalled by him.

1740
01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:55.780
I live in Belfast and knew about 10 people who were devastated.

1741
01:49:56.030 --> 01:50:00.520
Here is a BBC news article about the whole thing.
Love all the way from Belfast,

1742
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:01.730
Ireland.

1743
01:50:01.730 --> 01:50:05.530
<v 6>Wow.
Kiva O'CONNELL.
Wait,
so sorry.
Yeah,</v>

1744
01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:10.400
fucking a man.
So they did cancel.
He did counsel.
It sounds like he did.

1745
01:50:10.530 --> 01:50:13.760
I mean cancel because he said it's all the shows are none and I guess that is a

1746
01:50:13.761 --> 01:50:18.230
good position to have as a portfolio if you're,
if you're traveling abroad,

1747
01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:20.600
I think it's,
and for the sake of the fans,
you can't,

1748
01:50:20.601 --> 01:50:23.120
who are you going to decide who gets to see the show?

1749
01:50:23.150 --> 01:50:26.570
How are you going to decide,
you know which night and which,

1750
01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:28.880
which nights are people going to get screwed on?
That's not cool.

1751
01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:31.820
How would he do that?
I guess,
right?
And like how would he choose?

1752
01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:35.630
That's what I'm saying.
So he's probably,
it's actually a smart,
but that's crazy.

1753
01:50:35.631 --> 01:50:40.220
They wouldn't let him.
Cool stuff.
Slick stuff.
Neat stuff.

1754
01:50:40.610 --> 01:50:42.590
Garth Brooks,
are you,
did you,
did you,

1755
01:50:42.620 --> 01:50:46.250
did you know that the country music was so big and in Northern Ireland?

1756
01:50:46.251 --> 01:50:48.980
I would never have guessed.
I never would have guessed honestly.

1757
01:50:48.981 --> 01:50:50.590
This is how detached I,
I would've never,

1758
01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:55.490
<v 0>I guessed that he is of this level of popular everywhere.</v>

1759
01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:59.480
No,
I mean I knew he was a star.
I didn't have any doubt about that.

1760
01:50:59.870 --> 01:51:03.590
But like when I was in
Edmonton,

1761
01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:08.780
I was in Edmonton earlier this year and he was there.
He did nine arena shows,

1762
01:51:08.810 --> 01:51:12.560
bananas.
They like in her though in a row where the Oilers play,

1763
01:51:12.710 --> 01:51:17.710
they put a banner like where they put championship banners of Garth up there at

1764
01:51:18.351 --> 01:51:19.790
the end of the ninth show and they're like,

1765
01:51:19.791 --> 01:51:24.620
this is what an impact you just had here.
I mean,
you know,
we're talking,

1766
01:51:24.830 --> 01:51:29.360
he goes somewhere and does hundreds of thousands.
Sure.
Bigots.

1767
01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:34.580
I had no idea he was that big of a star.
You know?
I just knew he was a,
you know,

1768
01:51:35.530 --> 01:51:40.280
a big deal,
but not like that.
I mean,
I always say white people have feelings too.

1769
01:51:40.610 --> 01:51:41.510
And when people do

1770
01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:42.393
<v 6>where people do,</v>

1771
01:51:42.790 --> 01:51:46.930
and one thing we learned from Trump winning that there's been a group of people

1772
01:51:47.710 --> 01:51:50.980
that have been neglected and maybe,
I dunno,

1773
01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:54.910
I dunno his music by maybe he sings songs about people in a desperate situation

1774
01:51:54.911 --> 01:51:58.440
that excel can you give them comfort and he really connects with that.
Yeah,

1775
01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:01.150
I don't attack.
Hey Papa Concha.
I just,
I don't know music,
you know,

1776
01:52:01.151 --> 01:52:06.151
but if he is doing that and obviously he is good for him and um,

1777
01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:11.620
but that's just,
well,
Canada is not that surprising.
It is still North America,

1778
01:52:11.621 --> 01:52:12.454
you know,
but,

1779
01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:17.480
<v 0>but all the,
this holy shit that he's sold out that stadium,</v>

1780
01:52:17.970 --> 01:52:21.470
they couldn't keep the tickets.
That's crazy,
man.

1781
01:52:22.060 --> 01:52:26.120
<v 6>I mean,
he's a very principled person because 400 how many,
how much is I?
Oh,</v>

1782
01:52:26.150 --> 01:52:27.930
I'll be a whore.
Yeah,
yeah,

1783
01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:35.380
yeah.
It's a lot.
I didn't hit him.
He doesn't need the money,

1784
01:52:36.430 --> 01:52:40.120
but he's going to take that money course.
Yeah,
he's got a feed.
Trish.

1785
01:52:40.910 --> 01:52:45.840
I'm just getting bigger every year.
Oh Man.
I think I'm you guy.
But

1786
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:50.810
<v 7>I love it.
I say it to to get your eyes to go wide.
Uh,
now that you guys are,
are,</v>

1787
01:52:51.060 --> 01:52:55.190
are talking about blind people.
I got a short and simple question.
Yeah.

1788
01:52:55.490 --> 01:52:59.870
Do twin brothers have the same dick size?
I'm sure they know,

1789
01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:03.920
but I don't this,
I don't have a twin brother Frank.
Frank asked life mysteries.

1790
01:53:03.980 --> 01:53:07.570
Yoshi,
we,
that's a great question.
A great,
quite open.

1791
01:53:15.090 --> 01:53:15.923
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

1792
01:53:20.430 --> 01:53:24.930
<v 7>We should call it urologist.
How could validate or just a twin.
A twin.
Okay.</v>

1793
01:53:24.931 --> 01:53:27.260
We need,
we need someone that's an exact twin when call called,

1794
01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:28.740
he didn't say that.
Dead.
All right.

1795
01:53:28.741 --> 01:53:32.340
Well I'm assuming not fraternal twins are identical.
Yeah.
He said no,

1796
01:53:32.341 --> 01:53:35.970
I'm saying he didn't specify whether it was identical or fraternal in cause

1797
01:53:35.971 --> 01:53:37.500
there's,
there's obviously you can be,

1798
01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:42.640
<v 15>I have no reason to say this,
but I would imagine if you identical,</v>

1799
01:53:42.641 --> 01:53:44.080
you're identical with everything.
You,

1800
01:53:44.460 --> 01:53:47.760
<v 7>I think so,
but a mirror.
I think that's what he's,
he's at.</v>

1801
01:53:47.761 --> 01:53:51.970
But I'm assuming that the deck is the same size,
I'm assuming.
Do,

1802
01:53:52.090 --> 01:53:53.940
who can we call that the toy?
You have to find,

1803
01:53:53.941 --> 01:53:57.750
we know people that are twins isn't Ryan?
Ryan's a secular?
Yeah,
he's a twin.

1804
01:53:57.780 --> 01:54:00.640
Is He an identical or fraternal journal and then Nike.
Yeah,

1805
01:54:00.970 --> 01:54:04.410
but then maybe the question,
let me just see if I can,

1806
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:08.810
<v 15>it's interesting.
I'm a true thing to say about that one.
Um,</v>

1807
01:54:09.650 --> 01:54:14.390
I don't know what study it was,
but each succeeding son,

1808
01:54:14.391 --> 01:54:19.190
you have the percentage of that kid being gay,
gay,
higher.
Really?

1809
01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:20.351
Yeah.
And then,

1810
01:54:20.351 --> 01:54:24.710
and another one was my friend Ogi Ogas who wrote a book called Billy and wicked

1811
01:54:24.711 --> 01:54:27.590
thought he's a professor at Harvard.
He said that,
um,

1812
01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:32.920
gay men in general have a bigger penis than heterosexual men by saying quarter

1813
01:54:33.110 --> 01:54:35.540
to a half inches.
I don't know where that's three company.
He's a scientist.

1814
01:54:35.541 --> 01:54:39.080
But yeah.
Is there a reason for it?
Do we know why?
Or a theory

1815
01:54:40.850 --> 01:54:45.840
maybe be,
well,
I mean,
most heterosexual people meant the one that matter,

1816
01:54:45.841 --> 01:54:48.520
but gay men are more sexually aggressive.

1817
01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:52.110
<v 7>Oh yeah.
They fuck a lot more probably than straight guys.</v>

1818
01:54:52.140 --> 01:54:53.730
That's why when they think they're sissy and stuff,

1819
01:54:53.731 --> 01:54:58.731
which is weird because their appetites way stronger than they fuck like crazy

1820
01:54:59.190 --> 01:55:03.470
and it's so readily now we also had debates about blind people.
Uh,

1821
01:55:03.510 --> 01:55:05.850
how do blind people know when they're done wiping?

1822
01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:09.870
<v 15>Oh,
take a shit.
And there was a blind person know when they're done.</v>

1823
01:55:11.670 --> 01:55:15.670
Especially black blind person because the,
the,
the,
the well,

1824
01:55:15.710 --> 01:55:18.900
how would you know when,
when,
when does it begin and end?

1825
01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:22.500
I mean he's already to blinds.
I was already blind so yeah,

1826
01:55:22.950 --> 01:55:25.000
but they have a partner,
right?

1827
01:55:25.620 --> 01:55:27.990
That just because they are blind doesn't mean they're going to have a blind

1828
01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:29.153
partner either,
right?

1829
01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:32.500
<v 7>No,
not so your,
your theory is that they caught me,
I don't know.</v>

1830
01:55:32.501 --> 01:55:35.110
I mean the call the partner in and go,
hey,
tell me,

1831
01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:38.230
tell me when this paper is white again.
Is that what you think?

1832
01:55:38.590 --> 01:55:38.891
<v 15>Yeah.</v>

1833
01:55:38.891 --> 01:55:43.510
Or how does a very successful rich and powerful blind people know we've data and

1834
01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:44.220
go looking people

1835
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:46.950
<v 6>because they must have assist in like it should go.
Like how would you know?</v>

1836
01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:48.990
You can feel,
they can feel your face.

1837
01:55:48.991 --> 01:55:51.540
They touch your face and your features and see if they're symmetrical,

1838
01:55:51.610 --> 01:55:53.160
but if you never seen their face before,

1839
01:55:53.161 --> 01:55:57.540
how do you know what's a good looking good?
I cemetery,
I'm guessing.

1840
01:55:58.830 --> 01:55:59.760
Okay.
Dad.

1841
01:55:59.761 --> 01:56:04.410
I'm guessing you can tell by features of the nose is like a cute button nose or

1842
01:56:04.411 --> 01:56:07.350
is it,
you know,
wonky or whatever.
I don't know.

1843
01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:09.780
This isn't going to Christina arena,

1844
01:56:09.781 --> 01:56:13.770
but you know that thing in Plato's republic that all the real objective standing

1845
01:56:13.771 --> 01:56:17.860
and there's a fire,
so that's three of the cave.
You she,

1846
01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:23.310
so they're seeing a shadow of something that has no real,
but to them it's real,

1847
01:56:23.311 --> 01:56:25.470
right?
Correct.
Until they go to the light of day.

1848
01:56:25.590 --> 01:56:29.910
Do you think the blind people they have in their head what's pretty phase,

1849
01:56:30.030 --> 01:56:33.760
even though they've never seen a pretty face ever before?
Yes.
You do.
Okay.

1850
01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:37.920
They have an ideal that's different than maybe yours or mine maybe.
I don't know.

1851
01:56:38.430 --> 01:56:39.300
They have,
they have different,

1852
01:56:39.301 --> 01:56:43.380
I'm having somebody that's never seen a face as an ideal of a pretty face.
Yes.

1853
01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:46.040
Yeah,
I think so too,
because there are other senses are heightened.

1854
01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:49.800
We've had blind people write in and it wouldn't match.
It wouldn't,

1855
01:56:49.801 --> 01:56:52.950
it wouldn't be maybe the same ideal as societal ideal,

1856
01:56:52.951 --> 01:56:54.850
but it would be an ideal in their mind.
Sure.

1857
01:56:55.380 --> 01:56:58.680
So we've had blind people write in and they say that the people know how to

1858
01:56:58.681 --> 01:57:00.840
finish wiping based on touch.
Okay.

1859
01:57:01.050 --> 01:57:06.050
This year your sensitivity to touch is heightened and you can feel the resist or

1860
01:57:06.260 --> 01:57:10.190
Helen killers.
Fuck.
Because she has no senses at all.
She was fucked.
She,

1861
01:57:10.250 --> 01:57:13.890
they taught her a good baseline of stuff though.
I don't know.
I think of that.

1862
01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:18.540
One of the things you would probably do if you were blind,
you would say,

1863
01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:22.440
you would ask,
Hey,
who's,
uh,
who's objective,
who's considered very beautiful?

1864
01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:26.220
Then you'd,
you'd learn with that.
There you go.
Then you'd be like,

1865
01:57:26.221 --> 01:57:29.610
this is beautiful.
This is beautiful.
Okay,
so because that would,

1866
01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:34.410
your sense of touch would be heightened and you'd have a memory of that.

1867
01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:38.520
You know,
that this is what,
it's a verb victims,
ugly.
Cause when you touch them,

1868
01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:43.400
they have a beef jerky face.
Right?
So beef jerky pace,

1869
01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:49.050
right.
Everybody's idea of what's beautiful is different.

1870
01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:51.900
I Dunno.
Sickler man,
he never responds.
He isn't.

1871
01:57:52.050 --> 01:57:54.960
He supposed to come on here and talk about the Hillary Clinton thing that he

1872
01:57:54.961 --> 01:57:59.160
didn't tell anybody about and then he uh,

1873
01:57:59.190 --> 01:58:01.710
he partied with her once I started to drop another book,

1874
01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:04.710
but there was a book called survival of beauty.

1875
01:58:04.740 --> 01:58:07.830
Beautiful professor named Nancy Act off wrote a book.

1876
01:58:08.100 --> 01:58:13.100
But she said there is definitely certain mathematical ratio of somebody being

1877
01:58:13.980 --> 01:58:16.590
absolute have full clarity propulsion.

1878
01:58:16.830 --> 01:58:19.380
And I know sometimes people say you shouldn't judge people by the book or

1879
01:58:19.381 --> 01:58:21.750
whatever,
but if you're living in third world countries,

1880
01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:24.570
it's important that you judge people by their face because you don't know if

1881
01:58:24.571 --> 01:58:28.610
they have leprosy.
You know,
these are the collect practical things.
Um,

1882
01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:34.570
it's just men.
We always do this.
We've judged women by the visual cues.
Yes.

1883
01:58:34.710 --> 01:58:39.330
Women more psychological cues.
Absolutely.
You know,
I'm looking for red flags.

1884
01:58:39.810 --> 01:58:42.340
You said that you had red immediately when we were dating

1885
01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:46.480
<v 7>immediately.
This is a joke series.
I want to hear this.
I want to know.</v>

1886
01:58:46.481 --> 01:58:50.710
I'm going to know what was the problem.
Tom's red flags.
Okay.
Number one.

1887
01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:54.160
I'm very antisocial.
I invited him to a party.

1888
01:58:54.430 --> 01:58:57.220
This is like right when we were kind of starting to date.
I go,

1889
01:58:57.221 --> 01:58:59.710
come to this party,
what's on our friends are going to be there.

1890
01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:02.710
He doesn't show up.
And then I see him around,
I'm like,
hey,

1891
01:59:02.711 --> 01:59:05.620
why don't you go to that party?
He goes,
oh,
I fell asleep.

1892
01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:07.660
So that was kind of weird that like

1893
01:59:07.710 --> 01:59:10.050
<v 15>he shot goes.
Tom Always seem very social to me.</v>

1894
01:59:10.270 --> 01:59:11.103
<v 6>Really?</v>

1895
01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:16.660
<v 7>I don't think so.
And then when we started dating we were um,
you know,</v>

1896
01:59:16.870 --> 01:59:20.500
it was a kissy face time and we're so in love and he was like,

1897
01:59:20.501 --> 01:59:24.100
I like you so much,
I just want to stab your eyes until they bleed.

1898
01:59:24.101 --> 01:59:26.860
I want to punch you.
I want to,
I want to just kill you.

1899
01:59:26.890 --> 01:59:28.960
Like he kept talking about wanting to murder me and stuff.

1900
01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:32.330
I would say things like,
I want to put your head through that dresser.
Right?
Yeah.

1901
01:59:32.650 --> 01:59:37.600
But I mean it was,
I said it like in a jokey.
Yeah.
Yeah,
it stole flag.
Yeah.

1902
01:59:37.780 --> 01:59:38.920
I just,
I turned it into it.

1903
01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:41.540
I turned to red flag into a pink flag cause I was like,
wow.

1904
01:59:41.541 --> 01:59:43.870
It could be a sense of humor thing.
Yeah.
We,
we're both comics.

1905
01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:47.210
So it was this past summer thing.
Yeah.
But there's,

1906
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:50.660
there's still some shit under it and then you shouldn't have examined.

1907
01:59:50.661 --> 01:59:51.494
What changed though?

1908
01:59:51.500 --> 01:59:54.940
Obviously if everything worked out well it's 12 years later and towards more

1909
01:59:54.950 --> 01:59:59.690
normal and you know,
but um,
what changed?
I just got to know him better,
I guess.

1910
01:59:59.740 --> 02:00:03.680
Yeah.
Any other,
there's some other flags made me to this day.
Like what?

1911
02:00:03.770 --> 02:00:06.860
I'm talking to yourself a lot.
Like I love the,

1912
02:00:07.010 --> 02:00:10.520
this is two days ago I look over and he's literally going

1913
02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:17.140
<v 6>like my,
like freaking out to himself and I'm like,
are you talking to?
He's like,</v>

1914
02:00:17.890 --> 02:00:20.770
oh,
so and so I'm having a thing.
I do that a lot.
I do that a lot,

1915
02:00:20.771 --> 02:00:23.620
but I don't think that's that big of a red flag.
No,
I don't.
I don't,

1916
02:00:23.621 --> 02:00:25.250
my dad does it too.
So I,
I,

1917
02:00:25.251 --> 02:00:29.710
I've seen him do it so many times and it does make me either amuses me or I'm

1918
02:00:29.711 --> 02:00:32.080
like,
the fuck is wrong with you,
so I can only imagine.

1919
02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:35.570
<v 15>So because,
gosh,
we don't care if you have a career or good credit,</v>

1920
02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:40.250
we just look at your face,
uh,
the proportion of your body,
your breasts as,

1921
02:00:40.670 --> 02:00:44.900
but there's a genetic reason for that.
But women look at guys and say,

1922
02:00:44.930 --> 02:00:48.890
is he strong enough to protect my offspring?
As you have a social status?

1923
02:00:48.891 --> 02:00:53.120
Is he kind,
you know,
did you know these,
these things that really matters?

1924
02:00:53.121 --> 02:00:57.460
So guys just need a nice pair of tits and that's it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It,

1925
02:00:57.550 --> 02:00:58.580
it is true,

1926
02:00:58.581 --> 02:01:03.050
but there's a reason that the fats are unimpressed and as is what necessary to

1927
02:01:03.051 --> 02:01:04.400
keep a baby very healthy.

1928
02:01:05.530 --> 02:01:08.130
<v 7>And luckily for me,
she's got a couple of state troopers on it.</v>

1929
02:01:10.740 --> 02:01:15.130
They're so big and droopy now.
They're not.
Oh my God,
they're destroyed.

1930
02:01:15.150 --> 02:01:16.360
Please destroyed.

1931
02:01:17.570 --> 02:01:21.220
<v 6>All right.
Um,
what else?
Is there anything,
what do you got coming up,</v>

1932
02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:23.400
which you got?
Um,

1933
02:01:24.690 --> 02:01:29.310
<v 15>well,
I also went in Canada,
by the way.
I was banned for 12 years and 12 years,</v>

1934
02:01:30.250 --> 02:01:34.350
the bandage usually seven or 10 years,
10 years.
But I was still afraid to go,

1935
02:01:34.351 --> 02:01:38.010
but I went up there for,
um,
um,
how the,

1936
02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:40.010
they take care of addicts in Vancouver.

1937
02:01:40.011 --> 02:01:43.940
So I had to go after working with the Russell Peters in Portland,
so went up.

1938
02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:46.910
It was so embarrassing because when you go up in the buzz,

1939
02:01:48.470 --> 02:01:51.180
they can't continue to travel to travel to Vancouver.

1940
02:01:51.181 --> 02:01:53.710
And unless everybody get on or that you have to tell them,

1941
02:01:53.711 --> 02:01:56.330
this person gonna get back on and go to Canada.

1942
02:01:56.510 --> 02:01:59.300
So I was the last one to get in and I had to talk to three officers,
you know,

1943
02:01:59.301 --> 02:02:02.810
I have to explain the whole fiasco.
I happened,
but I went up there.

1944
02:02:02.930 --> 02:02:05.840
What was the initial band for like a fight or alcohol?

1945
02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:09.950
I was opening for Russell Peters,
but I had a bag of porn,
which is fine.

1946
02:02:09.980 --> 02:02:14.450
That's legal will come into bravo was run.
Does that time.

1947
02:02:14.451 --> 02:02:17.720
Michael Jackson got in trouble for second accusation molestation.

1948
02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:22.100
So in my notebook I wrote Michael Jackson's favorite child porn titles.

1949
02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:25.040
And so they find a bag of porn,
which,
how porn?
Titus data,

1950
02:02:25.041 --> 02:02:29.380
which is called top or no grapher shit,
you know,
kindergarten cock,
spongebob,

1951
02:02:29.390 --> 02:02:33.630
no pans,
hairless.
And Seattle,
Connie,
I fucked the kids where they are.

1952
02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:38.420
These are,
these are great comedians.
How did that turn into a band?

1953
02:02:39.170 --> 02:02:40.003
Well,

1954
02:02:40.220 --> 02:02:44.420
they took me to this room and when every one of those db and DVDs and I had to

1955
02:02:44.421 --> 02:02:48.080
stand in there for three hours watching porn with these three Canadian officers

1956
02:02:48.590 --> 02:02:52.340
because they were making sure there's no kid in there then,

1957
02:02:53.090 --> 02:02:57.290
but they have to get me for something.
And you know,
even if somebody here,

1958
02:02:57.291 --> 02:03:01.270
I was falsely accused of child porn,
my life is over.
Yeah.
So there's a,

1959
02:03:02.270 --> 02:03:06.740
I'm glad you think that's funny.
So is so over.
So

1960
02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:10.500
I don't know why that's so funny.
It wasn't funny at all.
Yeah.

1961
02:03:10.610 --> 02:03:12.410
It wasn't funny when that happened,
but um,

1962
02:03:12.650 --> 02:03:15.800
or you could just admit you're working for this guy,
would a work visa.

1963
02:03:15.801 --> 02:03:17.210
I said that I agree with that.

1964
02:03:17.211 --> 02:03:19.970
I don't care about now going to Canada for 10 years.
I'd rather take that.

1965
02:03:20.150 --> 02:03:24.880
But what was so funny,
not funny at the time,
but as he's typing my problems,

1966
02:03:24.881 --> 02:03:26.220
cause he said if you go to,

1967
02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:29.510
we could make it see a judge about your child porn even though there's no cad.

1968
02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:33.660
Yeah,
there's a job for,
and then Russell,
Peter called me have to,
hey,

1969
02:03:33.661 --> 02:03:36.170
it's in the shore.
It's a star now or where are you?

1970
02:03:36.171 --> 02:03:37.790
And I told him the situation and he goes,

1971
02:03:38.030 --> 02:03:40.890
well you deal with do with motherfuckers,
go fuck them Joe blow.

1972
02:03:41.060 --> 02:03:46.060
The guy heard him say that and I saw him like he paused and like delete whatever

1973
02:03:46.641 --> 02:03:50.780
he's typing and then retype something over nest.
So Russell think is funny,

1974
02:03:50.781 --> 02:03:53.330
but it wasn't fun.
I'm a was just terrifying,
you know,

1975
02:03:53.331 --> 02:03:56.480
and they're just going after peep and then they sent you back.

1976
02:03:57.020 --> 02:04:00.380
They let me do the show because there's no fly back that night.
So,

1977
02:04:00.381 --> 02:04:04.310
but they say first day in the morning you have to leave.
So I did a show,
um,

1978
02:04:04.311 --> 02:04:06.440
I did one show in them in turn and then I have to fly back.

1979
02:04:06.620 --> 02:04:11.460
So I went up there for,
um,
um,
um,
Canadian centering,

1980
02:04:11.500 --> 02:04:14.930
amazing job in Vancouver saving people because they have the only one on the

1981
02:04:14.931 --> 02:04:17.830
plays in Vancouver,
east hasting Vanda,
uh,

1982
02:04:17.870 --> 02:04:22.280
Vancouver Network of drug users or union or something.
Uh,

1983
02:04:22.330 --> 02:04:25.150
they were kind enough to invite me up there and,
uh,

1984
02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:26.990
I still about 80 people inject heroin,

1985
02:04:27.740 --> 02:04:30.710
but they're saving people's lives because they're no overdosing.

1986
02:04:30.740 --> 02:04:35.330
They have a community to,
to,
uh,
help people with a spirit of STD and a number of,

1987
02:04:35.331 --> 02:04:39.270
um,
overdose dropped crime drop and it's working.

1988
02:04:39.271 --> 02:04:42.060
And then we were trying to pass a similar measure in Seattle by didn't pass.

1989
02:04:42.061 --> 02:04:44.130
And uh,
um,

1990
02:04:45.570 --> 02:04:49.290
we lost a bunch of dear friends and acquaintance and comedy because of the

1991
02:04:49.410 --> 02:04:52.900
<v 6>diction overdose and the policies that we have is,
it's terrible.
Yeah.</v>

1992
02:04:53.570 --> 02:04:55.760
So are you going to,
you have any upcoming shows you,
oh,
yeah.

1993
02:04:56.330 --> 02:05:00.710
<v 15>August 10th,
uh,
laughs on,
limited in Sacramento APM.
If it's the first,
um,</v>

1994
02:05:01.190 --> 02:05:04.320
illegal comedy show,
illegal comedy.com.
And,
uh,

1995
02:05:04.330 --> 02:05:06.870
I'm sailing magazines after the show.

1996
02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:10.390
<v 6>This is magazine.
You guys,
he gave us some August 10th.
Yeah.
Okay.</v>

1997
02:05:10.810 --> 02:05:13.610
<v 15>Um,
it's,
it's a great weekend because August 11 to 12,</v>

1998
02:05:13.850 --> 02:05:17.420
you are doing show in Sacramento.
Punchlines,
right?
It's got to be a fun weekend.

1999
02:05:17.421 --> 02:05:18.630
So,
uh,

2000
02:05:18.640 --> 02:05:21.890
we were going to show video from the magazine until I knew exactly what I'm

2001
02:05:21.891 --> 02:05:22.724
doing.

2002
02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:27.170
I need to sell tickets because I'm already minus 600 is literally blood money

2003
02:05:27.171 --> 02:05:28.610
I'm paying.
So if no one shows up,

2004
02:05:28.730 --> 02:05:31.570
<v 6>I'm fine.
Where's the,
where's it at?
Where's the laughs on limited.
Oh,
add.</v>

2005
02:05:31.571 --> 02:05:32.404
Last Limited.
Okay.

2006
02:05:32.410 --> 02:05:36.910
<v 15>Apm.
August 10th.
And um,
nobody where 11th in Phoenix or Glendale,</v>

2007
02:05:36.911 --> 02:05:41.570
Arizona at the club.
Off the cuff,
we're doing another illegal comedy.

2008
02:05:41.571 --> 02:05:46.530
So I'm basically just break even to people that we want to help people to Adeq

2009
02:05:47.170 --> 02:05:49.840
drug problems.
And I'm great man.

2010
02:05:49.841 --> 02:05:52.540
I'm trying to go and dig up Canada to do a big show.
Hopefully,

2011
02:05:52.541 --> 02:05:55.660
maybe even have a Russell Peters hosting it.
But,
uh,
um,

2012
02:05:56.170 --> 02:05:58.100
we lost 67,

2013
02:05:58.210 --> 02:06:02.230
almost 70,000 Americans last year and the year before that 35,000.

2014
02:06:02.231 --> 02:06:06.550
So that is a massive,
dramatic,
sad.
We're losing.

2015
02:06:06.580 --> 02:06:10.220
These are the bad people.
I just want people don't the dcis or your brother,

2016
02:06:10.221 --> 02:06:15.070
sister,
uncle,
and even grandparents and our policies are hurting people.

2017
02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:18.970
It's misguided.
So,
um,
I want to hopefully save people's lives.

2018
02:06:19.470 --> 02:06:21.510
<v 6>That's a very powerful message,
man.</v>

2019
02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:23.940
I'm glad you're doing that and your fans are wonderful.
