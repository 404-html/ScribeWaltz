25
00:01:58.331 --> 00:02:00.130

43
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:04.900

49
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:31.360
house live in sperm via we have it to make a correction.
Sorry,

50
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.650
that wasn't your fault.

51
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.150
You made it logical assumption which was that if you had tickets to the July

52
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:40.630
Irvine Improv podcasts that they transferred.
They did.

53
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:42.370
Not Everyone was refunded.

54
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.860
So if you want to go to the October 8th Irvine,
your mom's house live,

55
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.270
you got to get tickets.
They are at the bottom of my tour page.

56
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:56.020
If you go to [inaudible] dot com slash tour scroll all the way to the bottom,

57
00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.120
it says live podcasts.
You can get tickets to either west palm or Irvine there.

58
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.613
That's right.

59
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.160
Oh and tickets for my shows are on thousand ranch.com or you can go to
Christina.

61
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.160
Doing a little image overhaul before my special comes out.

62
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.570
Making the change to going to be,
it's going to be safe.
I can't announce it yet.

63
00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:22.990
It's so annoying.
Hopefully soon we can make a formal announcement,

64
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:26.950
but it's coming.
Good,
Mike.

Very exciting.

we went on a little three day vacation with the little jeans,</v>

76
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.330
just a local here and we couldn't get her out of our hearts.

77
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.620
The most soup lady came with us and we had to play her and rob,
we had,

78
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.340
we listened to our own show just to hear the drop.
Oh yeah,

79
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.730
<v 0>Yeah.
We were like finding this stuff from,</v>

80
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.240
from the,
that like scrolling through it,
trying to find out,
you know,
like what,

81
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:45.100
what was said and hearing,
hearing it again just in real time.
Yeah.

82
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.920
<v 2>Part is that because you,</v>

84
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:55.610

It's even,
it's even more trashy.

85
00:06:55.611 --> 00:06:56.444
It's even better.

86
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.680
<v 0>Yeah.
Amazing.
Amazing.
Um,
we even,
by the way,</v>

87
00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:05.630
this is not something we normally do.
Let me see if I can,
uh,
pull this up.

88
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.270
So we had,
we've had like all these great designs come in.
Uh,

89
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.400
and this one was also sent in the moose soup men's black tee shirt.

90
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.470
So somebody may call it dark one with a soup can on it,

91
00:07:21.471 --> 00:07:24.920
but it's a brilliant design and it says the mill,
the moose soup lady.

92
00:07:24.921 --> 00:07:29.450
So that's also in our store.
Thank you.

101
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.880
No,

Yeah,

102
00:08:05.881 --> 00:08:10.230
We have two shirts dedicated to her.
It's good.
Too good.
But she's too good.

103
00:08:10.231 --> 00:08:14.600
And the designs are too good to not do them.
So thank you guys for,
um,

104
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.070
for supporting the store silliness.
Ridiculous.

105
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.660
I think we lose money on these shirts.
Just make them,
yeah.

106
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.960
Yeah.
Uh,

107
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.890
somebody said that there's nothing quite as PTSD and do things as the rub rub

108
00:08:28.891 --> 00:08:29.350
guy.

109
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:30.520
<v 2>I have to agree.</v>

110
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.600
There's nothing like that guys who I don't like him.

111
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.760
I don't like him as much as I liked the moose suit lady.

112
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:41.530
<v 0>Well,
no,
she's great.
You guys are doing good.
Uh,
all right,</v>

113
00:08:41.531 --> 00:08:45.550
let's do it.
Official Open,
right?
Yeah,
let's do it all ready.
And I first read,

114
00:08:45.551 --> 00:08:48.460
I suspect in 2014 when I was having sex with my girlfriend,

115
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.700
I noticed that she had this really strong smell of os and I really liked it.

116
00:08:53.711 --> 00:08:55.740
I found it really enjoyable and arousing.

117
00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:01.430
<v 2>It kind of smelled like this rich odor of body sweats combined with the smell of</v>

118
00:09:02.761 --> 00:09:03.690
shit.
Basically.

119
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.220
<v 4>How old is Randy?</v>

120
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.080
<v 2>Don't bring anyone loving to them.</v>

121
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:16.580
<v 1>Well,
welcome to your mom's house with Tom.</v>

122
00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.253
Christina.

123
00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:47.793
Okay.

124
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.760
<v 2>Yeah,
yeah.</v>

125
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.450
No one you now,
Huh?
You know,

126
00:10:06.451 --> 00:10:08.820
you put a tree in your mouth and then halfway through it you're like,

127
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.780
I don't want to commit to this.
Yeah,
I know exactly what you're talking about.

128
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.270
I just did that.
Now I don't think I want it,
but I'm going to do it.

129
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:16.680
Ever since I lost some weight.

130
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.370
I always think about whether I like what I'm eating or whether I'm just eating

131
00:10:20.371 --> 00:10:24.390
to eat right.
Is it worth the calorie?
I just also,
I'm like,
I used to be like,

132
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.280
this isn't that good,
but I'll eat the whole thing.

133
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:30.090
Like that's how I used to just walk through everything.
Yeah.
Like a dog.
Like,

134
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.500
it's all right.
I'll finish it.
No,
this is okay.
But I'm still gonna go through it.

135
00:10:34.501 --> 00:10:38.580
Yes.
Yeah.
And it'd be,
you know,
really calorically and sugar rich and I'd be like,

136
00:10:38.581 --> 00:10:42.510
yeah,
man,
just eat it.
It's like a dog.
Like they can't refuse a tree,
right?
Yeah,

137
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.710
yeah.
I just,
I should have just put that out,
but I don't have anywhere to put it.

138
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.230
I could've put it in my hand on my part and then put it in my pocket in your

139
00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:50.700
pocket.
Next.
Done that before.
Oh,

140
00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:53.610
you're fucking with the other friends of your pocket friends.

141
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.990
So this kid,
um,
he's a blogger and I have to say,
you know,

142
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:05.220
I commend him for his honesty.
Uh,
my,
I think the,
the general,
you know,

143
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:10.140
the,
the inclination of people when they hear that right away,
it'd be like,
Oh,

144
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.930
you nasty as hell.
Course some y'all was just nasty.

145
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:17.030
And he talks about being attracted to the ass bump,

146
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.290
but I think it's a pretty common one actually.
Well,

147
00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:22.950
it must be on a evolutionary biological level,

148
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.400
and there's a reason our bodies produce pheromones and different smells.

149
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.190
And to some people of y'all is nasty.
He's healed.
Yeah.

150
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.280
So he's found his ideal mate perhaps.
Yeah.

151
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.120
Who makes that smell and they're going to reproduce and make other children who

152
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.090
stick,
make nasty smells nasty babies.
But I've met,

153
00:11:39.091 --> 00:11:42.660
I've talked to dude's before who are into like funky smells,
you know?
Sure.

154
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.960
Well guys are disgusting too.
That was going to say,
but I wonder,

155
00:11:45.961 --> 00:11:50.240
I mean there's got to be some women that are into the funky smell,
right?
No,
none.

156
00:11:50.241 --> 00:11:53.740
I mean,
I've never had a friend that admitted to it.

157
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:57.160
I'm sure there are guys would admit to it more.
Yeah.
Yeah,
there's gotta be,

158
00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.880
but the women are just less nasty.
I know.
You are less nasty.

159
00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:03.700
There's definitely way more dudes that are like,
I like a funky ass hole.

160
00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.910
It's not on the menu for most of us ladies.
Yeah.
Well I mean I,

161
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.150
okay,
let's put the call out.

162
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.570
Are there any ladies out there who love the smell of a ripe guy ass

163
00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.650
or any ladies that are lesbians?
Maybe you like about smells

164
00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.990
<v 5>but smells.
Maybe that's thinky but smells disgusting.</v>

165
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.670
But it smells really nice to me.
I really liked the smell.
Is that weird?

166
00:12:29.671 --> 00:12:33.510
We start normal because the smell of shits shouldn't be nice.

167
00:12:33.511 --> 00:12:34.770
It shouldn't be pleasant.

168
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:38.790
They shit disgusting and repulse people because Shit isn't nice.

169
00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:40.740
It's disgusting and foot of bacteria.

170
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.050
You don't want to get anywhere near that stuff.
Well,

171
00:12:43.051 --> 00:12:46.440
I think there's an important distinction to be made here is that I don't think

172
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:51.950
he is necessarily aroused by shit curves aroused by the mix of this Musk of

173
00:12:53.281 --> 00:12:55.950
sweat.
Right.
And there's,
there's some but

174
00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.220
<v 2>in there.
Right.
And that's what's turning him on.
Right.</v>

175
00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.510
It's not just a dump sitting in the toilet.

176
00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:06.620
Well that's a really important distinction really is though.
It's like we,

177
00:13:06.621 --> 00:13:08.960
it's like our revelation of shits.

178
00:13:08.961 --> 00:13:12.700
Push the farts out not far to push the shit out.

179
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.980
Mistakenly we're saying for years,
years.
Well,

180
00:13:15.981 --> 00:13:19.540
my mother gave me that wisdom and flats,
Bush the shutout,

181
00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.120
and that's all I heard going up.

182
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.560
It's almost like your mother was a flat earthers and then somebody just kind of

183
00:13:24.561 --> 00:13:28.310
explained it to you.
Like it doesn't work that way.
It's not that far.

184
00:13:28.311 --> 00:13:29.144
It's push the shit up.

185
00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:34.410
One of our listeners actually opened our eyes and our buttholes too real.

186
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.550
And that's another one that you and I have been talking about this last week

187
00:13:37.551 --> 00:13:40.370
together is that it's the shit that pushes the farts out.

188
00:13:40.371 --> 00:13:44.330
And I just kind of blew my mind til kind of blew it.
Well there are,

189
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.500
you know what,
uh,
I guess it's people's body smells you,

190
00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:52.460
you like,
it's that person's pheromones mixed in with whatever.

191
00:13:52.461 --> 00:13:57.170
He must really be into this girl.
But it could be,
I mean,
yes,

192
00:13:57.171 --> 00:14:01.790
but also like you can have that,
that attraction to someone you don't know.
Right.

193
00:14:01.791 --> 00:14:06.240
He could just be like,
oh,
I like,
I guess this person smells.
Yeah.

194
00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.340
I've also been repulsed by the way,
stranger,

195
00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:15.020
just like their body smells,
you know,
repulsion.

196
00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.760
I've had manufactured smell repulsion from perfumes,

197
00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.420
colognes,
fucking Pachulia oil,
petroleum oil.

198
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.750
That's my least favorite man.
If you were one of those chicks,

199
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.400
it be no boners in this house.
Well cause perpetually growing up,

200
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:36.310
growing up when I went to San Francisco for college,
if that girl wore.

201
00:14:36.311 --> 00:14:39.010
But truly it meant that she didn't wash her beaver very often.

202
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:42.240
Like those were always the dirtiest of the girls that had Pachulia,

203
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:46.660
Eh hmm.
Interesting.

204
00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.840
<v 5>It was really no spill.
Every time we had sex,
doggy style,</v>

205
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.770
and every time I thrusted forwards,

206
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:55.720
the smell would waft upwards into my nostrils.
And it was Rudy arousing.

207
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.080
I really enjoyed the smell.

208
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:01.880
I don't know why she had such a strong smell of ass because you should ego a

209
00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:02.733
stone house,

210
00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:06.380
strong smell because they wash properly down there after they've taken a shit.

211
00:15:06.381 --> 00:15:09.860
So true.
I'm not sure if she wasn't washing properly after she took a shit,

212
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:14.440
but I wasn't complaining because I said,
yeah,
I really enjoy life now.

213
00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:18.260
So good for you man.
I can see that relationship.

214
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:21.290
I always check to see if the girl has this same smell.

215
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:25.880
But none of them do because they usually wash,
wash that area.
Yep.

216
00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.440
<v 2>So that was like his special mistress.</v>

217
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:31.760
That was a snowflake and he let it get away.
He left that stinky bottle.

218
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.780
Don't let that Brown dirty girl to get away wasn't necessarily washing.

219
00:15:36.781 --> 00:15:39.720
Well that's true.
No,
she didn't.
She wasn't.
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.

220
00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.500
So she was just not white or she has leaky,

221
00:15:43.501 --> 00:15:47.130
but leaky boat was just something that I talk about a lot on this show and the

222
00:15:47.131 --> 00:15:49.980
importance of shit to shower or getting a bad day of some sort.

223
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:54.360
She could be shitting and then not cleaning up properly and,
and having leaky,

224
00:15:54.361 --> 00:15:57.810
but,
and then if you're having sex and then it Kinda all mixes in down there.

225
00:15:57.811 --> 00:16:02.150
Yeah,
I like that.

226
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.270
You just be swamp ass.
Maybe these are never smelled my,
my bud.
Never.

227
00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:10.800
You don't want to no,
no,
no.
Never.
No.

228
00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:14.760
No.
Do you smell your own bottle lot?
No.
No.
No,

229
00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:18.090
but I'm sure it's not nice.
It's disgusting.
I mean,

230
00:16:18.091 --> 00:16:19.590
you can give it a shot if you want it.
Nope.

231
00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:25.600
<v 5>Until there's no smell left,
which I find to be really disappointing.</v>

232
00:16:25.601 --> 00:16:28.080
It's really boring when the goal smells like nothing.
Yeah.

233
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:32.950
Smell is a big part of sex for me.
And if the goal smells like nothing,

234
00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:35.200
she has no body odor.
It was kind of boring.

235
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:39.770
<v 2>I agree with him.
I agree with him.
Yeah.
I don't want,
I mean,
out of the shower.</v>

236
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:43.030
Yuck.
Give me,
let me know that you're,
uh,

237
00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:46.700
you're doing some work and building your mosque.
Yeah.
Build that Musk.

238
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:51.440
There was a real Musk builder at that gym.
I used to go,
woof,

239
00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:52.580
I remember it.

240
00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:57.260
I do with fal and it was like a message to the rest of the gym to the bears.

241
00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:00.380
Yeah,
I'm here.
Smell my funk.
He was nasty.

242
00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:03.260
But there's probably dudes walking around that Jim like,
ah,
fuck.

243
00:17:03.261 --> 00:17:05.590
That dude stinks.
So good.
Anyway,

244
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:10.080
as I came in thinking about this is what I can see our son doing this blog,
this,

245
00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:14.100
Oh god,
I hope not.
He will to this kind of thing.
Well,

246
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.090
he's got two parents and I know that's true.

247
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.810
<v 5>I don't like having sex with girls after they've had a shower because they've</v>

248
00:17:20.811 --> 00:17:24.290
washed away all that delicious odor and smell pretty shallow sex.

249
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.620
It's just so much better than just shower sec.

250
00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.250
<v 2>I just said it totally right.
100%.</v>

251
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:32.210
<v 5>And do you remember that Iranian girl that I met last year and yeah.
Yeah,</v>

252
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.540
the one that I asked if she wanted to have sex with me and she said No.
Well,

253
00:17:35.541 --> 00:17:38.420
one of the main reasons why I felt so attracted to her,

254
00:17:38.421 --> 00:17:40.820
it wasn't because I thought she was pretty or cute.

255
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.910
It was because she had this amazing smell of armpits.

256
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.680
Every time she sat next to me and my room,
I could smell this strong,
rich,

257
00:17:48.681 --> 00:17:52.070
bitter smell of armpit,
and it was really a rousing here.

258
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:55.320
So he likes more than just certain.
He likes a lot of stinky stuff.

259
00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.950
They should have just asked if I could smell her armpit instead of asking for

260
00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.440
sex.
But then if I smelled her armpit,

261
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.590
I would have been even more aroused and turned on and it would have wanted to

262
00:18:04.591 --> 00:18:09.240
have sex even more.
This channel was getting kind of weird,

263
00:18:09.241 --> 00:18:10.074
isn't it?

264
00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:15.970
<v 0>I celebrate you,
sir.
You always tell me,
you're like,
I've never smelled.</v>

265
00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:20.590
You never smell.
You never smell.
Yeah,
it's true.
I'm serious.

266
00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.730
In how long?
38 years we've been together.

267
00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.360
I've never gotten a whiff of bio from you.
What about Trish?

268
00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:33.640
Trish is a little stinky.
She's got that wine mouth.
Yeah.

269
00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.910
Yeah.
Karen too.
The both of them cigarettes.

270
00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:41.290
Barflies Marlboro reds.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Moose soup.

271
00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:46.360
Oh yeah.
Both kind of moose soup type of chicks for sure.

272
00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:51.760
Yeah,
that's definitely,
definitely your speed.

273
00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:57.500
Dirty pic.
So stupid.
So stupid.
Um,

274
00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.960
so I did a what?
Yeah,

275
00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:02.680
what are you talking about your appearance last night?

276
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:07.120
That's what I was bringing.
Okay.
Okay.
Um,
I did um,
Conan.

277
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.200
Is that how you say it?
That's funny that that's his name.
Yeah.
Yeah.

278
00:19:11.201 --> 00:19:13.860
Meet many Conan's I have a,

279
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:19.420
I had a really fun time doing the show and I got to,

280
00:19:19.421 --> 00:19:20.380
I won't play the whole thing,

281
00:19:20.381 --> 00:19:24.850
but I did get to sneak this in to the top of the show or the top of the

282
00:19:24.851 --> 00:19:25.990
interview and he's like,
Oh,

283
00:19:25.991 --> 00:19:29.490
you look great and I'll let you hear the beginning of it.
It's pretty good.

284
00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.050
You did great by the way.
The whole thing is on.

285
00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:35.900
<v 5>Thank you very much,
man.
Thanks.
I lost 50 pounds,
50 pounds.</v>

286
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:42.440
Everyone wants to know how one does that because everyone's obsessed.

287
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:44.180
What was your trick?
Everybody's been there.

288
00:19:44.181 --> 00:19:48.950
I was in a weight loss contest with this super fat comic named Bernd Chrysler
and

289
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:57.490
<v 0>very crazy.
Got a burnt in there.
Yeah,
I did.</v>

290
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.880
Does he know yet?
Uh,
I don't know if he knows.
He's gonna know.

291
00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:05.530
Conan definitely knew what I was doing.

292
00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:09.700
He did because it's like there's a pre interview and I told the producer,

293
00:20:09.701 --> 00:20:12.130
I was like,
imma call him burnt.
I go,
you know,

294
00:20:12.131 --> 00:20:16.840
if you want to tell Conan to correct me and be like,
oh is that bird or you know,

295
00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.030
I go,
that's,
that's fine.
Or whatever.
I mean,
you know,

296
00:20:19.031 --> 00:20:22.030
obviously you can do whatever he wants and so,
but he,

297
00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:25.760
he definitely went like shook his head like,
yeah,
I know.

298
00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:31.120
What we did was we did a couple of people I think knew what was up.

299
00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:31.721
I think you're right.

300
00:20:31.721 --> 00:20:34.960
I think some mommies were in the audience because they laughed at top dog stuff

301
00:20:34.961 --> 00:20:39.370
too.
Yes,
yes.
So anyways,
you can go to team Coco.

302
00:20:39.371 --> 00:20:44.350
I don't play a clip after clip of that,
but team Coco,
um,

303
00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:48.040
dot com or the youtube team coco page

304
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:52.070
<v 2>and you can see it if you want.
You talk about top dog,</v>

305
00:20:52.071 --> 00:20:55.420
talk about a little jeans and uh,

306
00:20:55.510 --> 00:21:00.260
weight loss and we'd talk about,
we'd talk about Ya.
Um,

307
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:05.040
uh,
our little gene learning different languages and top dog.
Yeah,

308
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.410
it's a very good appearance.
I thought you said really well thanks.

309
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.110
And I also liked your outfit.
You look very fresh,
fresh and clean.

310
00:21:12.111 --> 00:21:16.060
I had a fresh haircut,
which is important for television.
He looked great.
Yeah,

311
00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:20.440
Conan and,
and how funny is Andy Tell I love him.
He's great.
He's fantastic.

312
00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:22.630
He's really,
really great.
Uh,

313
00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.770
somebody sent speaking a top dog this talking Dildo,

314
00:21:26.771 --> 00:21:31.310
embarrassed that they said sounds just like top dog.
You want to see it?
Yeah.

315
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.910
So does this sound like top dog to you?

316
00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:59.150
God.
Did Your Dad do this?
Does that sound like him to do a blue band was like,

317
00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:02.330
dude,
this thing sounds like to me,
I think it's a little different.

318
00:22:02.331 --> 00:22:07.000
Like my ear is so tuned to voice.
It's pretty similar.

319
00:22:07.001 --> 00:22:09.530
I think so.
Yeah.
I could pass for him.

320
00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:18.960
<v 4>Very nice</v>

321
00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:27.060
to hear.

322
00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:33.650
<v 2>This is what you owe and the voice is an older gentleman.</v>

323
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:39.730
He sounds like 50 press or 60 press and if you're using one of those,

324
00:22:39.731 --> 00:22:44.680
you're probably not 60 or 50 press woman.
What do you want to hear though?

325
00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:45.701
I don't know.

326
00:22:45.701 --> 00:22:48.760
I don't want to hear anything that you're doing that you don't want to hear a

327
00:22:48.761 --> 00:22:51.640
man?
No,
I don't need to.
I don't want to hear anything.

328
00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:55.350
But if you were to hear a man,
would you want them to be like,
I don't.

329
00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:00.260
I don't know.
I Dunno.
Why did you shave so much pool?

330
00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:03.740
<v 4>I'm going to follow up</v>

331
00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:13.190
<v 2>weird toy.
I don't know why it needs the voice.
It's a little bit,</v>

332
00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.070
I mean I'm sure somebody out there.
I was like,
that's perfect for me.

333
00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.270
It's always like that.
Just like that's sticky buttholes for somebody.
Yeah.

334
00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:26.200
<v 4>Gotcha.
You</v>

335
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:30.100
<v 2>picture my dad when you hear that I kind of kit,</v>

336
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:34.900
especially since last time we learned that he likes Lacy Bras,

337
00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:38.840
which is disgusting.
I told that on Conan.
Yeah.

338
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:42.970
Let me see through the nipple and throw up

339
00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:50.900
and other stuff.
I nasty.

340
00:23:50.901 --> 00:23:54.890
So nasty.
I ain't know it gives your dad a boner.
I know.

341
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.560
Gross.
So weird to hear his boner stories.
No,

342
00:23:59.561 --> 00:24:02.870
I don't think I'd want my vibrator to talk about anything.

343
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:05.630
Why does it have to have any kind of conversation with you?
I don't know.

344
00:24:05.631 --> 00:24:09.620
I mean I definitely,
I don't think it does it for me to have.

345
00:24:09.621 --> 00:24:13.310
If it was a toy that was like,
oh baby,
you're so hard.

346
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:18.110
I wouldn't be like,
yeah,
this is great.
It's kind of like real fake,
you know?

347
00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:21.160
I would,
I would think it would take me out of it more.
Yeah,
me too.

348
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:23.930
It'd be really distracting.
Like,
why is this guy telling me this stuff?

349
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.990
Like you don't say that in real life to somebody like,
oh,

350
00:24:26.991 --> 00:24:30.530
your breasts are so full and wow,

351
00:24:30.531 --> 00:24:33.650
your touches so soft.
Like,
I don't know.
I don't really,

352
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:36.530
I never had a guy said to me in real life,
I'd be like,
what?

353
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:40.760
Why are you talking about my dad very ready to explode.

354
00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:45.200
And it's like an old guy boys too.
It's not even shit ain't right.

355
00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:50.610
Nasty.
Assuming it was two men.
Super Nasty.
Anyway,

356
00:24:50.611 --> 00:24:53.930
so we went away on our,
our little mini vacay with our little jeans,

357
00:24:53.931 --> 00:24:58.080
just the three of us.
And I noticed a phenomenon,
um,

358
00:24:58.081 --> 00:24:59.180
amongst the couples,

359
00:24:59.181 --> 00:25:03.410
which we've been talking about this a lot on the show is the shut it down look

360
00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:08.540
and well for dads the shut it down is generally,
I mean,
what would you say?

361
00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.440
Shut it down.
Dad is the white new balance sneakers.

362
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:20.450
I'm talking Khakis or maybe some light colored denim with some brown braided

363
00:25:20.451 --> 00:25:25.410
belt.
It's buttoned down.
Over,
it's over.

364
00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:29.840
It's one testosterone just leaves the body.
And then for the women,

365
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:33.440
I think motherhood can shut us down and that's when the ladies cut their hair

366
00:25:33.441 --> 00:25:34.940
off or let it go gray.

367
00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:39.620
And then there's like a cool lots and it's important to note that neither has to

368
00:25:39.621 --> 00:25:43.640
happen though to either.
That's the whole point is the struggle is real though.

369
00:25:43.641 --> 00:25:48.641
You really do have to fight to maintain your sexuality and your sex appeal to

370
00:25:49.131 --> 00:25:51.080
your spouse.
Especially as you get older.

371
00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:58.790
You see people shut it down in their thirties forties 50s and stuff for sure.

372
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.790
But you can see the shutdown.
Yeah,
I saw it man.

373
00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:04.820
You're like 30 years old

374
00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:16.730
and there was like this Nick Attractive Late Thirties gentlemen and he was

375
00:26:16.731 --> 00:26:19.820
dressed like cool.
Like he still had like shorts on.
He was,

376
00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.150
he had his beard trend line.

377
00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:25.220
Like he would look to youthful and the wife had totally shut it down.

378
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.050
Like she had short hair like you,

379
00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:31.330
I was all gray and that gray grayed out and then like,

380
00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:33.020
like kind of dress like you right now,

381
00:26:33.021 --> 00:26:38.021
like a polo shirt and then like khaki shorts and then the Jesus animals.

382
00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:42.740
Oh Man.
And you could just see the sadness in his eyes.
Like he,
you know,

383
00:26:42.741 --> 00:26:44.040
he was looking at it like other women

384
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.410
<v 0>walked by.
I like,
oh,
that's what a woman I remember.</v>

385
00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.540
I remember that when I met you.
I liked you like that,

386
00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:54.150
but now you're not into a boners anymore.
It's so sad.

387
00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.170
But what,

388
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:58.980
but here's what the thing is that like there's the shut it down phenomenon.

389
00:26:58.981 --> 00:27:02.850
We're only one person shuts it down.
And then the other person,

390
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.240
like it's really well maintained.
So like what's going on there?

391
00:27:06.241 --> 00:27:10.370
When one person that's called the path to divorce the windows,

392
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:15.420
sometimes I think it's actually fetishized.
Interesting.
Smeller kid there.

393
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:18.840
Interesting.
Cause I know,
I don't know about it the other way as much,

394
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.840
but I know some dudes that really like,
you know,

395
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:26.430
I mean at least really big women.
Yeah.
So that could be perceived as like,
oh,

396
00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:29.520
does that person not care?
But actually they're turned on by it.

397
00:27:29.521 --> 00:27:31.520
They're really into heavy set.
Yeah.

398
00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:35.880
That's totally big old flappy sloppy roles.
You know what I mean?
That's a,

399
00:27:35.881 --> 00:27:37.200
that's a turn on for some people.

400
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:41.940
Well one time you and I were in The Bahamas somewhere and we saw this couple and

401
00:27:41.941 --> 00:27:46.710
then the dude was like ripped.
He was like 150 pounds.

402
00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:50.900
Just,
just,
there's wasn't an ounce of anything extra really.
Well,

403
00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:56.100
totally ripped.
I had the six pack abs.
Yeah.
Looking good.
She was for bills.

404
00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:01.680
Really?
No,
she was very large.
Yeah.
And she was like,
oh man.

405
00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:07.020
Oh Man.
She uh,
she needed,
she called him over to pick her up from the,

406
00:28:07.021 --> 00:28:10.740
she had like sat in the,
where the waves break never forget,

407
00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:12.150
I will never forget

408
00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:20.500
is I got to get up and he had to pick her and he had to like use all of his body

409
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:21.960
weight strength to get her up.

410
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:26.040
I'll never forget it because she was sitting like in the shallows of the ocean

411
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:30.870
and the waves kept pushing her inland and she was kind of riding those waves

412
00:28:30.871 --> 00:28:34.090
cause she couldn't stand up.
It was like too hard for her.
Yeah,
she was huge man.

413
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:39.300
I'll never forget the image of him pulling,
like pulling her up and I thought,

414
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:43.350
wow,
what's happening?
Like what do you think this was a slow progression.

415
00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:44.693
And he was like,

416
00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.720
on this particular couple while it could be that like,

417
00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:55.170
oh he loves her or he's doing,
he's seemed broken.
I remember that guy.

418
00:28:55.830 --> 00:29:00.470
He didn't,
there was,
there was no joy in his face.
You know,

419
00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:05.360
everything about the way he carried himself like a sad man.
Beaten dog.
Yeah.
Yeah.

420
00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:09.200
It wasn't,
it wasn't Michael Hart.
I don't think maybe my,

421
00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:13.030
I won't know unless I talk to him and reach down his pants.
But,
uh,

422
00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.680
I felt like he was not the time that was like,
this is what we're really into.

423
00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:19.870
This,
it seemed like,
it's interesting.
She was a,
uh,

424
00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:22.590
I almost picked up that she was abusive.

425
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:26.430
That was my version of her fatness was a form of abuse to him.

426
00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:30.600
That's what it seemed like to me.
Yeah.
Yeah,
definitely.
Oh yeah.

427
00:29:30.601 --> 00:29:34.370
How did we not think about this when we,
uh,
we're playing this smell,

428
00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:42.450
smell luck.
And there's again guys,
no women in there.
There's no,

429
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.570
no,
there's no women in it.

430
00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:48.210
<v 6>Run your finger along the crack of your ass.
You don't need to finger your whole,</v>

431
00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:49.950
you don't want to come back with shit on your finger.

432
00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:55.400
<v 0>No.
Shit.
Dummy.
That's a very interesting advice.
Stupid.</v>

433
00:29:55.850 --> 00:30:00.620
Who says that?
That guy,
that dog trainer,
that pup play master.

434
00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.170
I want to fucking asshole.
I love that.
In that thing,
he's like,

435
00:30:04.171 --> 00:30:05.630
I'm just trying to train these dogs,

436
00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:09.980
but he's like really doing a service to people.
Uh,
just so you know,

437
00:30:09.981 --> 00:30:11.570
coming up in a little bit here,

438
00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:16.220
we will have the great miss pat joining us.

439
00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:20.690
She has a new book coming out

440
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:27.020
and it's a called rabbit.
We both got copies of it.

441
00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:31.700
We'll be talking to her very shortly.
Um,
it's excite.
Uh,

442
00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:36.590
she's got quite a life story.
Crazy story.
Great comic.
Uh,
very,
very funny.

443
00:30:36.591 --> 00:30:40.850
If you ever have a chance to see miss pat,
I would definitely go get it.

444
00:30:40.851 --> 00:30:44.940
She is fucking hilarious.
Yeah.
She's really easily to la.
Yeah.
Where's she?

445
00:30:44.941 --> 00:30:48.500
She's in India.
I think she's an Indiana,
not India.
Yeah,
but yeah.

446
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:53.390
So she's what you saw that you said India Indi.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

447
00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:56.240
She doesn't live in India.
You think I've met,
that's what I thought I was saying.

448
00:30:56.260 --> 00:31:00.260
Bombay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No,
no,
no.
She was like a Punjabi.
No.

449
00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:03.680
Can I read you an email?
Yeah,
please.
So yeah,

450
00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:05.930
<v 2>I thought this was very thought provoking and I,</v>

451
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:10.850
I always want to bring these emails to your attention and to the collective

452
00:31:10.851 --> 00:31:13.280
consciousness.
Okay.
What's up jeans?

453
00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:18.310
My wife and I were laying in bed when all of a sudden I farted and it sounded

454
00:31:18.561 --> 00:31:22.700
like a Queef.
This raised the question,
why is it called a Queef?

455
00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.080
Queef doesn't really fit.

456
00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:28.250
My wife's suggestion was a fussy affording pussy,

457
00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:32.990
but I think it should be called blower cause it just sounds like air.

458
00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:37.370
We all enjoy.
Oh,
we will enjoy our moose soup while waiting for the answer.

459
00:31:37.371 --> 00:31:41.870
Keep it high and tight.
Hitler's Eric,
I'm a little confused.
Fart.
Yeah,

460
00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:45.810
he farted and it sounded like a Queef.
Oh.

461
00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:50.210
Which led them to the thinking of why is it called a Queef?

462
00:31:50.211 --> 00:31:54.620
Queef doesn't really fit.
Yeah.
Wait a minute though.
But he just farted.

463
00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:59.990
But FARC can sound like a queef.
Right.
But I mean if,
if he farted,

464
00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:03.020
right,
it's still just a fart.
I mean fart sound different all the time.

465
00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:05.510
It's still,
it is called a fart.
Yes.

466
00:32:05.511 --> 00:32:09.200
But then it got them to thinking because it sounded like a queef not a fart.

467
00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.480
<v 0>I understand that.
Oh,</v>

468
00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:15.390
what I'm saying is anytime anybody farts and you fart out of your buffalo,

469
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.910
I say it's just a fart.
I mean this doesn't matter if it,

470
00:32:17.911 --> 00:32:20.260
it can sound like any number of things.
Right.

471
00:32:20.261 --> 00:32:21.760
Why would you give it a different label though?

472
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:25.070
<v 2>Cause it sounds different.
No,
no,
no.
So he,
that's not the question.</v>

473
00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:29.840
The question is why is a queef called a queef not what is a fart?

474
00:32:29.841 --> 00:32:32.270
That sounds like a cliche if we've called a queef correct.

475
00:32:32.271 --> 00:32:37.271
Like it doesn't seem to match a pussy fart is what a Queef so he's saying it

476
00:32:37.761 --> 00:32:41.630
should be called a fussy.
Oh,
okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Right.
Like why is it called that?

477
00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:45.050
And I mean I have a theory,
I was thinking about this to hear it.

478
00:32:45.051 --> 00:32:45.884
I'm real excited.

479
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:51.310
The British word for Virgin Fanny Quim Right.

480
00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:57.560
Or a fanny.
Fanny Fart.
But Quim right.
So maybe it's something to do with that.

481
00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:01.730
Hmm.
Quim origins.
Queef yeah,

482
00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:05.210
that's where I really don't know.
But there needs to be a name for it,

483
00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:09.290
which I think,
I thought Queef was widely accepted.
It is why they said it,

484
00:33:09.291 --> 00:33:10.124
but it doesn't,

485
00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:15.680
I think he's right in that it's not a logical deduction.

486
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:20.090
It doesn't make sense.
Why the Queef?
It should be called a p a puff.

487
00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:24.620
A part.
Like when we were trying to come up with a fump.
Correct?

488
00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:29.120
Correct.
Now you see it.
Oh poof.
Well,

489
00:33:29.121 --> 00:33:30.860
let's look up where queef comes from.

490
00:33:30.861 --> 00:33:34.280
Maybe wonder work queef comes from

491
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.930
<v 0>Charles.
Given you the plug there.</v>

492
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:43.800
<v 2>It's a really
big debts.</v>

493
00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:48.810
Go See Christina do doing stand up.
Now we're talking standup

494
00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:55.240
standups.
It might be hard for me to find the etymology.
Okay,

495
00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:57.720
let me try it here at him.

496
00:33:57.721 --> 00:34:00.730
Origin Queef

497
00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:06.860
let's see what it says.
Yeah.
God.
Save the Queen.
Okay.

498
00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:09.430
<v 0>Uh,</v>

499
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:10.930
<v 2>no Spanish word for Queef.</v>

500
00:34:10.931 --> 00:34:13.330
Equip the sound of air escaping from the vagina during,

501
00:34:13.331 --> 00:34:18.070
after intercourse is slang for vaginal flash and that we know that,

502
00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:19.390
but we don't know.

503
00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:21.283
<v 0>MMM.</v>

504
00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.590
<v 2>Interestingly,
in 1686,
although less frequently than previous definition,</v>

505
00:34:26.591 --> 00:34:31.591
quipping meant sexual intercourse especially had with or by a prostitute.

506
00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:36.440
Okay.
Let me,
a Queef has changed and if I'm going hit shine from an,

507
00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:40.390
an a queef relatively derogatory towards women.
Okay.
I don't fucking know

508
00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:45.200
<v 0>any,
any,
no,
nothing,
nothing,
nothing.
Nothing.</v>

509
00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.760
<v 2>I mean,
it doesn't give us the etymology.
I,
I'd have to read it closely.</v>

510
00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:57.650
It sounds like it's been around for quite some time.

511
00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:00.890
It's one of those words that you will fight,
like for instance,
scumbag.

512
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:04.630
Did you know that it's because the con condoms were called Gumbo.

513
00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:06.020
You fill it with Scott

514
00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:11.270
and then come just comes from scum.
Yeah,

515
00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:16.490
we dropped the scumbag right.
And come back.
So it was probably just one of those,

516
00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:19.580
you know,
16 hundreds.
It was like a funny fart.

517
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:24.640
<v 7>Yeah.
Quigley.</v>

518
00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:25.870
I thought she was going to Queef

519
00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:38.140
<v 2>that much.
Wow.
Really Nice.
Yeah.
Okay.</v>

520
00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:41.070
Anything else?
Yes.
So uh,

521
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:46.430
we were talking a lot about twin dicks twins that are identical.

522
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:48.593
Okay.

523
00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:53.943
<v 4>Did</v>

524
00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:01.140
you find out some interesting sing

525
00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:05.840
<v 2>Dick News?
I did.
This comes from g James.
He writes,</v>

526
00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:11.860
hi.
Hey Hitler's.
I work with a set of paternal twins.

527
00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:15.950
What are paternal twins?
Is that correct?
Or fraternal?
Yeah,

528
00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:19.450
paternal.
Paternal twin.
Maybe that is a word.
I don't know.

529
00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:23.440
The other day we were discussing podcasts and I brought up you're very

530
00:36:23.441 --> 00:36:27.820
scientific question.
Do twins have identical penis?
Well,

531
00:36:27.821 --> 00:36:32.710
it turns out in my cohort out in my coworkers have conducted an in depth

532
00:36:32.711 --> 00:36:34.870
comparison.
In their case,

533
00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:38.160
they do in fact have identical penises.
Oh,

534
00:36:38.161 --> 00:36:41.170
it must be a fraternal was it's like an auto,
correct.
Probably.

535
00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:45.410
I'm assuming they have identical fraternal dicks.
Yeah.
Wow.

536
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:50.050
Same size,
same shape,
same everything.
Right down to the curvature.

537
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:54.070
So even though they're not identical,
their penises are,
so yes,

538
00:36:54.071 --> 00:36:55.210
this is fraternal twins.

539
00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:58.270
I thought you would like to know this piece of information in your quest for

540
00:36:58.271 --> 00:37:02.170
truth.
Keep it high and tight,
James.
Oh my God,
you guys are so disgusting.
Well,

541
00:37:02.171 --> 00:37:06.760
it's funny because I'm Ryan sickle cell.
Sickler is a fraternal twin.

542
00:37:06.761 --> 00:37:08.580
I and I mentioned this before,
he said they,

543
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:12.410
they've done comparisons and they have different dogs.
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

544
00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:15.430
Well the mysteries of life,
everything,

545
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:18.580
the mysteries continue and mysteries continue.

546
00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:22.600
And moving on to our blind series of questions.

547
00:37:22.601 --> 00:37:26.050
We've been asking a lot of questions about the blind.
Can they wipe,

548
00:37:26.051 --> 00:37:30.460
how do they know when they're done wiping a,
and this is an interesting one too.

549
00:37:30.461 --> 00:37:35.440
Hey Mom,
I know this could seem like an obvious question,

550
00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:39.250
but after hearing the superpowers of blind people knowing when they are done

551
00:37:39.251 --> 00:37:40.900
wiping just by their senses,

552
00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:45.400
I thought this could actually be the same way.
My question is,

553
00:37:45.401 --> 00:37:49.480
Do Blind Men always pee sitting down?
To me,

554
00:37:49.481 --> 00:37:53.570
this seems like an obvious yes because they can toilet odd.

555
00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:58.270
I never thought of such a provocative question and we'll never know if they have

556
00:37:58.271 --> 00:37:59.780
any extra spray to clean up,

557
00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:02.830
but maybe their super powers are strong enough to handle this.
Again,

558
00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:06.250
thanks for everything.
I would absolutely love glass in the podcast every week.

559
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:09.610
Well,
here's what I would say to that.
I mean at first you go,
of course,

560
00:38:09.611 --> 00:38:14.320
what a brilliant thought.
But if you were blind and you know your space,

561
00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:17.800
right,
you know your toilet,
you could still just be like,
oh,
here's the toilet.

562
00:38:17.801 --> 00:38:19.810
And then you would know where it is.

563
00:38:19.811 --> 00:38:23.620
You know how to aim and you also can hear your p hitting the water.
Well,

564
00:38:23.621 --> 00:38:27.010
interesting.
I mean,
have you ever,
uh,
in the middle of the night,
gone to Pan,

565
00:38:27.011 --> 00:38:30.260
you stand?
Oh,
of course.
Every single time.
Well then there you go.

566
00:38:30.261 --> 00:38:34.960
When it's dark in there.
Yeah.
But I've,
I've done it in pitch black and I'm,

567
00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.370
it's the little like in hotels,

568
00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.710
<v 0>you know,
and you're like,
oh fuck.
And then,
but you do,</v>

569
00:38:38.711 --> 00:38:41.110
you generally do it by like,
here it is.

570
00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:44.710
Like you kind of get like a sense of the,

571
00:38:44.711 --> 00:38:47.660
it's right here and then you go by the sound because the,

572
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:51.600
your p stream hits the water in the toilet and then all sudden you hear like
the,

573
00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:54.310
the,
uh,
the porcelain,
you're like,
oh,
I'm off to the,

574
00:38:54.311 --> 00:38:57.410
and you kind of go back down to the water,
you know?
Fascinating.

575
00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:01.030
I never knew this.
I never knew all this.
Do a urinal.
I mean,

576
00:39:01.031 --> 00:39:05.020
I would assume that if the,
you know,
you know where it is,
you could aim for that.

577
00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.690
I mean,
but it's an interesting question.
I think it's interesting.

578
00:39:07.691 --> 00:39:11.320
We have a deaf question too.
Um,
here it is.

579
00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:16.460
Uh,
how do deaf people wake up?
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

580
00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:18.220
How can we never have asked this before?

581
00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:21.050
Thank you for answering life's important questions.
Like,

582
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:23.120
how do blind people and know when to stop wiping?

583
00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:26.150
And two identical twins have the same size penis.

584
00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:29.660
I have one that's been bothering me for some time out.
How'd you,

585
00:39:29.661 --> 00:39:31.250
what deaf people wake up in the morning?

586
00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:36.320
I'm talking about sound sleeping deaf people can't wake up to some weak flashing

587
00:39:36.321 --> 00:39:39.710
light alarm or a tiny vibrating alarm.
You keeping your bed,

588
00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:45.110
keep it high and tight.
Jason.
I go retarded.

589
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:47.240
I don't know.
That's a great question.

590
00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:52.600
I assume that for the deaf they must sell a really strong,

591
00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:57.800
really strong version of a flashing light and a vibration.

592
00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:03.290
I know a lot of vibration vibration goes a long way with deaf people.
Yeah.

593
00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:07.210
I'm going to go with smell a smell cal.

594
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:11.570
But how are you gonna have a smell alarm?
Um,
well we have those,

595
00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:15.650
those MREs in our room.
Oh.
So like one of those goes off it smell machines.

596
00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.110
You put something in there.
I mean,

597
00:40:18.111 --> 00:40:20.930
you know how you wake up to somebody cooking breakfast downstairs?

598
00:40:20.931 --> 00:40:24.010
I don't know why they can't make an alarm clock.
No,
you're right.
Smell.
I mean,

599
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:27.170
I remember in an,
uh,
in high school,

600
00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:31.460
we played a deaf school once for a,
not for a regular season game,

601
00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:33.740
but for a,
like a spring game.

602
00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:38.160
And they had somebody hitting a drum on the sideline for the snap count.
Oh Wow.

603
00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:40.490
Boom.
And then they knew like,

604
00:40:40.491 --> 00:40:45.491
go on to go on three going on should they felt the vibrations vibrations.

605
00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:50.690
We're sitting there like,
just,
you're so used to somebody going like blue 32.

606
00:40:50.691 --> 00:40:55.520
Ha Ha.
Like nothing.
You just don't,
yeah,
we fucked them up.

607
00:40:55.521 --> 00:40:59.900
We fucked those deaf kids up.
Yeah,
totally.

608
00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:05.240
Yeah.
No,
but I mean,
I thought it was interesting.
You know,

609
00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:08.330
it is interesting.
And what'd you like think about?
You're like,
oh,

610
00:41:08.331 --> 00:41:13.010
that makes sense.
Yeah.
They can't,
no one can do a snap count.
Regular one.
Mommy's,

611
00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:18.060
since we use Mr to talk about males and miss and Mrs is talk about females.

612
00:41:18.171 --> 00:41:22.790
What word do we use to refer to Zimmers?
Like ourselves?
Zach.

613
00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:27.400
Huh?
Oh,
they are Zim.
So this is,
and this is,

614
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.460
oh,
is that,
how would,
if they are [inaudible] that's their pronouns then.
Right.

615
00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:37.560
So here is the uh oh right are fun.

616
00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.040
Right?
Cause you go like,
here's Mrs p,
right?
Fuck,

617
00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:42.940
<v 2>well this is crazy because does it,</v>

618
00:41:42.941 --> 00:41:47.080
does the non binary community completely as shoe the mister or missus

619
00:41:47.081 --> 00:41:50.420
distinction because they're non binary,
right?
I'm nonconforming

620
00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:52.860
<v 0>gender.
You cool.
Right.</v>

621
00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:57.540
I would prefer that used my,

622
00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.633
um,

623
00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:03.210
<v 2>okay,
what's your pronoun?
But I guess they're trying to say is like,</v>

624
00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:08.330
are you trying to to denote whether this person's a married Zamzar you know what

625
00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.790
I'm saying?
Yeah.
So then that's the question.
Okay,
here's the question.

626
00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:15.810
It's a good question.
So then how do you like,
here's Mr. So and so he's like,

627
00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:17.650
let's say you're presenting someone right

628
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:21.390
<v 0>who's none gender fuck conforming.</v>

629
00:42:21.391 --> 00:42:26.340
Would you say here is this is,
did you see that?

630
00:42:26.341 --> 00:42:31.110
I'm like,
dammit,
that person said that,
uh,

631
00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:36.650
that that old SNL sketch pat was anti-trans propaganda.

632
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:39.400
But you think,

633
00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.240
<v 2>oh,
that's fucking stupid.
Yeah.</v>

634
00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:45.680
I think it's silly to presume that 20 years in the past people had the

635
00:42:45.681 --> 00:42:50.030
forethought of being transphobic.
Like it,
it just was like back then guys.

636
00:42:50.031 --> 00:42:52.730
That's just how people were.
And it was a funny fucking sketch.

637
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.710
Everybody loved that character,
pat.
I don't,

638
00:42:56.711 --> 00:43:00.190
I don't think anybody had any intention other than making people laugh back
then.

639
00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:03.640
<v 0>This is the person who,
uh,
who said it.</v>

640
00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:07.680
Jill Solloway is an American comedian,
playwright,

641
00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:13.350
writer,
director Salaway identifies as nonbinary prefers a singular,

642
00:43:13.351 --> 00:43:17.400
they pronoun won best director for Afternoon Delight,

643
00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:19.081
also known.

644
00:43:19.081 --> 00:43:23.580
They are also known for their work on six feet under and for writing.
Oh,

645
00:43:23.581 --> 00:43:28.440
so this is,
they are the creator writer,
director of transparent.

646
00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:33.650
<v 2>Wait a minute though,
they were married to Bruce Gilbert and then separated.</v>

647
00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:37.090
Now how we,
I wish we could ask Joe what,
how she would prefer to be.

648
00:43:37.091 --> 00:43:40.490
It's not she shit.
They,
how they would prefer.

649
00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:45.560
Now here's a problem with a Va.
However,
as a pronoun is that it denotes a plural,

650
00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:49.970
right?
It's not a singular person.
They are.
Yeah.
It's,
it's problematic.

651
00:43:49.971 --> 00:43:52.850
I'm not sure that they is still the best pronoun for for this.

652
00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:53.900
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

653
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:57.890
I'd stone in the English language and I'm not sure.

654
00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:01.750
<v 0>Oh man,
that's,
um,
but I thought that that the,</v>

655
00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:05.840
the story was absolutely absurd that,

656
00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:09.740
that pat was not propaganda.
I don't think so.

657
00:44:09.741 --> 00:44:14.090
That was a funny sketch and that sketch in my memory,
I mean,
yes,

658
00:44:14.091 --> 00:44:19.091
it was a while ago was like universally celebrated as just a really funny,

659
00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:23.870
like the concept of Pat,
if you never saw it,
was that you didn't know.

660
00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.740
And so people were always like,
oh,

661
00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:29.460
<v 2>right.
They were actually,
everybody was trying to be respectful.</v>

662
00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:32.620
They weren't pronouns,
they don't want to Pat's feelings.

663
00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:35.540
And so the whole thing was how they were tap dancing or,
and,

664
00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:40.260
and kind of arousal to gender.
What gender are you?
And this is funny.

665
00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:44.440
Then they would try to solve it and they'd think they got close.
Yeah.

666
00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.250
And then they throw another curve ball.
You're like,
fuck.
Yeah.

667
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:50.160
And it was always really,
I thought was very cleverly written,
you know,

668
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:52.740
at the time.
Yeah.
I don't remember the exact details,

669
00:44:52.741 --> 00:44:56.790
but I thought people loved pat and I thought of it as hateful or anything.

670
00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:00.000
I don't,
I don't,
I don't know.
What's Your Pronoun?
And I think,
I think,

671
00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:03.360
I think they need to go to therapy and work out whatever.

672
00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:07.560
I mean like if you're offended by something 20 years ago that SNL did,
like,

673
00:45:07.561 --> 00:45:12.060
I think you got bigger emotional fucking issues.
I think they do have those.
Yeah.

674
00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:17.070
You know what I was watching on Netflix?

675
00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:21.690
A fucking police academy,
man.
Oh yeah.
Some people today,

676
00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:23.490
you know what?
And I would think that too,

677
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:28.320
but it turns out all the underdogs of society or actually the heroes in that

678
00:45:28.321 --> 00:45:30.890
movie.
If you think about it,
it's high tower.
Yeah.

679
00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:33.350
It's officer Jones with attainment that avoids,
yeah.

680
00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:35.530
That they always get the punch lines.
Yup.

681
00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:38.370
And they're always goofing on the white commandant and the,

682
00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:43.410
the white male characters punching up.
Yeah.
When you watch it again,
you go,

683
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.470
oh,
this isn't really that offensive.
Like I'm in.

684
00:45:46.471 --> 00:45:49.470
There was one thing where Steve Gutenberg tells the spy,

685
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:53.100
the spy for the common dot.
He goes,
where are you guys partying this weekend?

686
00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:58.100
He goes,
oh yeah,
come to the blue oyster bar for that.
And it's like the gay dude.

687
00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:02.250
But even so what happens is they end up dancing with the gay dudes in there and

688
00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:07.100
it's cool.
Like it wasn't,
that was back then,
there were a lot of gay punch lines.

689
00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:11.370
Yeah,
they'd be that.
I missed that.
Yeah,
that'd be like the big thing.

690
00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:14.670
The big joke that somebody was gay.
Yeah.
Yeah.

691
00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:18.750
So what should we go back and protest all those things?
Well,
I'm upset.

692
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.870
Propaganda.
Well,
and also look,

693
00:46:21.871 --> 00:46:24.660
him control was in it and it was very sexist.

694
00:46:24.661 --> 00:46:28.290
There are also parts where he's like,
what are your thighs like?
And she was like,

695
00:46:28.291 --> 00:46:31.710
they're creamy.
And like,
what?
You know,
I'm deeply offended.
Of course.

696
00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:35.250
How dare you,
how and feminist.
But it's just like the gays.
Yeah.
I'm,

697
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:37.710
I'm very offended by Steve Gutenberg.
What he did,
you know,

698
00:46:37.711 --> 00:46:41.820
30 years ago in a police academy movie.
I can't fuck with,
I can't,

699
00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:45.240
I can't deal.
Well,
you know what the problem is?

700
00:46:45.241 --> 00:46:46.830
It's not that people are offended.

701
00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:51.270
It's that we're rewarding people for being offended over a horse.
Shit like this.

702
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:54.560
The fact that the media,
anyone's applauding this,
this book,

703
00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:58.470
publishing that article,
it's crazy.
Right.
What are you planning?

704
00:46:58.471 --> 00:47:00.330
What are you talking about?
This is rubbish.

705
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:05.280
That's not a story and I mean propaganda probably that would,
that would,

706
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:11.150
that would mean that that sketch was developed has a deeper meaning than just

707
00:47:12.091 --> 00:47:14.410
the silliness of it.
It was,

708
00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:18.680
it was meant to have the social ripples come on,
man of the non binary stuff

709
00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:23.180
<v 8>trying to bite my tongue.
Relax.
Right now we have 28 pounds and $900 a week.</v>

710
00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:28.390
Smith
can meet Joe.

711
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:30.583
Was He gone?

712
00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:39.520
<v 2>Foreign Dad's talk like that.
I feel more.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.</v>

713
00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:41.480
They curse a lot more on their way harsher.

714
00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.750
<v 8>I'm telling you I'll fucking push you out</v>

715
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:59.530
<v 2>guys related to me.</v>

716
00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:02.350
<v 8>It's good
to</v>

717
00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:18.390
fucking push you out.
I'm telling you you do it again.

718
00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:23.400
Really upset
or something.

719
00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:27.390
I drive all the wide would be fucking shit to listen to.

720
00:48:27.391 --> 00:48:29.270
Your fucking Smelly Fox.

721
00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:32.520
Fucking freezing cold in here.

722
00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:39.940
<v 2>What'd your dad get this crazy?
No,
no,
no,
no.
He's not bothered.</v>

723
00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:46.420
Who used to get like funny,
funny,
upset.
It was my uncle Dave.
He'd go,

724
00:48:46.421 --> 00:48:50.380
when did you cut a fart?
When you cut a fart shit.

725
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:55.030
Oh Shit.
Oh,
he's like,
Jesus Christ,

726
00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:57.700
you stink.
And he would be like,

727
00:48:57.790 --> 00:49:02.230
but we would laugh and laugh and laugh and he would be like fake up but like

728
00:49:02.231 --> 00:49:03.940
kind of genuine upset.
It was funny.

729
00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:06.360
It's always fun when someone gets upset from afar.

730
00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:10.090
That's one life is worth living.
He would be upset.
My Dad really would be like,

731
00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:15.730
he'll go,
whoa,
God stinks.
Wow.

732
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:21.550
Cause bad one.
That's the big reaction.
What did he roll down the windows?

733
00:49:21.551 --> 00:49:25.540
At least you fart.
Whew.
Shit.

734
00:49:25.541 --> 00:49:30.190
Yet like that.
Your Dad doesn't even get mad.
He's so sweet.

735
00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:34.950
He's very low key.
My Dad was funny when I would fire it,
he'd be like,
fool.
Oh,

736
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:39.280
I started the way she's done it for am Buddha.
Buddha word buys Mac.

737
00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:42.420
I think you are so stinky are so fucking gross.
Really?

738
00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:47.320
And they roll down the windows just came in.
A buzz just came in.
Oh,

739
00:49:47.321 --> 00:49:51.640
I didn't hear it.
Why don't we hear anything?

740
00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:55.990
You don't hear it?
Nope.
Oh,
it must be your,
uh,
your line.
Am I lying?
Huh?

741
00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:59.420
Your ear buds.
I Dunno when I cut that,
uh,

742
00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:04.770
that channel to kind of,
how do I press pause and figure it out?
All right.

743
00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:10.300
All right.
I better,
yeah,
I know.

744
00:50:10.301 --> 00:50:14.650
I wanted to bring something up before he,
I wrote it down.
Yeah.
I had,

745
00:50:14.651 --> 00:50:19.651
I took a fish oil pill like a week ago for our cholesterol and then I burped and

746
00:50:21.701 --> 00:50:25.240
then an hour later and it smelled like salmon in my mouth.
Yeah,
it's gross.

747
00:50:25.241 --> 00:50:27.530
That was terrible.
Yeah.
Really bad.

748
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:32.990
<v 0>I a nasty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm muted.
Does that go away?</v>

749
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:37.330
Yeah.
You know,
I did.
I accidentally hit the PFL far,

750
00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:40.860
but we're good.
Okay.

751
00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:44.590
I've had those fish oil pills and it's like you,

752
00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:49.520
it's like you just ate a fucking,
like a salmon buffet or something.

753
00:50:49.521 --> 00:50:54.000
You can keep burping it up all day.
Nasties House.
Super Nasty as hell.
Yeah.
Mm.

754
00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:55.220
Yeah.
So gross.

755
00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:03.770
<v 8>Get Out of your fucking big vigil.
That's enough.
Get Out.
I'm fucking</v>

756
00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:06.473
fucking pulling.

757
00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:15.320
Oh,
it's got bad fucking bat ball game.

758
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:17.500
<v 0>Oh,
happy Mitchell.</v>

759
00:51:17.501 --> 00:51:21.190
And was nothing better than making your parents that happy or something stinky.

760
00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:23.880
Of course Charlotte would get upset.
So upset.

761
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.800
She had very dramatic casting.
Ah,
ah.
She would and she would be like,

762
00:51:29.801 --> 00:51:32.590
you're sick.
Like if she would do that whole thing,
you are

763
00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:38.360
<v 8>one fucking pulled over and you can run those juicy.
Good.</v>

764
00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:42.740
How are you?
Fuck and revolting.

765
00:51:42.741 --> 00:51:47.480
Seriously five and you're fucking fun shit.
And he fights.

766
00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:50.510
Oh my God.
Fuck.

767
00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:54.510
Revamping or you fucking joke.

768
00:51:56.750 --> 00:52:00.240
Oh,
what do you buy your baby?
Your daddy fuck off.

769
00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:04.040
Oh my God.
That's called a protein bar.

770
00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:10.270
<v 0>I'm protein.
It's really funny.</v>

771
00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:11.920
<v 8>That's called a protein bar.</v>

772
00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:17.940
<v 0>Your mum stallion.
Yeah,
they are broke.
D Bar Code.
A protein.</v>

773
00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:19.240
Okay.

774
00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:20.730
<v 8>That's called a protein bar.</v>

775
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:26.400
<v 0>That's fantastic.
Yeah.
Queens.
Lynn,</v>

776
00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:30.630
do you want to see a super excited guy?

777
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:35.370
I'm a guy who was super excited by these course.
He's really good.

778
00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:40.420
<v 9>Got It.
Bees and insects are capable of emotions that,
what would that imply?</v>

779
00:52:40.421 --> 00:52:41.880
I mean,
can you give us an idea?

780
00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:46.320
I don't see your plans choose actually be absolutely on you.

781
00:52:46.350 --> 00:52:50.730
These critters are amazing.
They get sad,

782
00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:55.740
they get sad,
pessimistic at times.
These are not all seekers,

783
00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:58.560
just like people know or not know,

784
00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:03.950
and they can count at least to four or they can be trained to arrive at three,

785
00:53:04.861 --> 00:53:09.390
four and five different times in a 24 hour cycle.

786
00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:12.930
They vote these insects.

787
00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:18.110
These little beings are extraordinary and there's central to our very existence

788
00:53:20.941 --> 00:53:21.980
on planet earth.
Mm.

789
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:26.080
<v 0>I have a pet peeve with people that are</v>

790
00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:31.080
<v 9>animal experts sharing what animals feel and think as if they know,</v>

791
00:53:32.681 --> 00:53:37.510
because some reachers research was done when he goes there.
Pessimistic.

792
00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:40.720
Some are thrill seekers.
Did you talk to them about it?

793
00:53:41.410 --> 00:53:43.360
Did they tell you how they felt that day?

794
00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:48.140
How do you know that what you are interpreting is sad is sad.
It's an,

795
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:52.170
it's a B.
What's the what?
What?

796
00:53:52.171 --> 00:53:54.750
What is the behavior that you're like,
oh,
he's fucking sad.
Right,

797
00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:58.210
and no way of knowing this guy.
She's always an adrenaline junkie.

798
00:53:58.211 --> 00:54:01.960
This be over here.
Yeah,
I don't.
It's ridiculous.

799
00:54:02.110 --> 00:54:07.000
They can't count to four either count a four at least.
There's no way.

800
00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:10.300
Well,
other than produce.
Look at this crazy guy.

801
00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:15.490
Crazy welfare bees.
How did these lower this a little bit,

802
00:54:15.491 --> 00:54:16.324
this Kyra,

803
00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:23.850
$577 billion for instance,

804
00:54:23.891 --> 00:54:28.630
each year,
75% out of his fucking mind.
Super annoying.

805
00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:32.650
At least 2.2 billion pounds of honey.

806
00:54:32.651 --> 00:54:37.380
44 millions.
He holds a BS in La.
Yeah,

807
00:54:37.381 --> 00:54:38.214
of course.

808
00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:46.480
It's crazy pain and cancer.

809
00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:53.540
Their medicines has warned that the disappearance of bees and

810
00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:02.680
she looks like an MTV VJ rattling the cages as the glasses don't seem like

811
00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:08.300
<v 0>glasses.
No,
this guy's fucking,
this guy's it.
He's so crazy.</v>

812
00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:10.130
I bet you he knows how to eat a box though.

813
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.890
Do you think he has like super Coalinga skills?

814
00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:16.900
<v 9>God,
some nasty deadly poisons.</v>

815
00:55:16.901 --> 00:55:21.520
Neo Nica to noise poisons that at about a dozen.

816
00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:22.653
Pardon?

817
00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:27.310
<v 0>Like,
uh,
those masturbation seminars.
Yeah.</v>

818
00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:30.390
[inaudible] in the circle and he's like,

819
00:55:30.391 --> 00:55:32.580
you can stroke from the top and then you can,

820
00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:35.400
one of the things I like to do is I switch hands.

821
00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:38.790
So you go back and forth and you build up,

822
00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:43.950
it'll build up that stamina and you just keep going and then you don't release.

823
00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:46.590
Like he,
he's,
he's done truck guy.
This guy.
Yeah.

824
00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:48.560
<v 9>AndW as I said earlier,</v>

825
00:55:48.561 --> 00:55:53.561
it was 7.5 billion procreating humans without the bees.

826
00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:58.810
We,
he's out of his mind.
I can't even watch it.

827
00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:03.610
I know he's too much.
He's actually too much.
It's crazy.
It's crazy.

828
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:05.290
Rob.
Rob,
rob,

829
00:56:07.550 --> 00:56:10.800
<v 0>do you think miss pat will like that guy?
Oh my God.
Which guy?
The Big Guy?
No,</v>

830
00:56:10.801 --> 00:56:14.080
the rub rub guy.
We should show her.
We should show her.
Rob.
Rob.
Yeah.

831
00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:18.440
I'm going to make a note of it.
We should show her the eye.
The Dad Bonar have a,

832
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:20.510
we can show her the bee guy and we could shore that.

833
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:24.250
The Canadian Trans Canada highway.
Yeah,
Dad.
He's great.

834
00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:26.200
I'm just curious to see her thoughts.

835
00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:29.530
What do you think she thinks we could ask her about the smell of ass kid?

836
00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:32.650
Something's wrong with him.
Sure.
I bet she'll think something's wrong with him.

837
00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:36.610
Yeah.
Yeah,
definitely.
Yeah.
Okay.

838
00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:38.680
I just burped and I burped up Broccoli.

839
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:43.120
I Made Broccoli for both of us today and you gave me a stellar review of my

840
00:56:43.121 --> 00:56:46.450
cooking.
What did I tell you?
Well then tastes like shit.

841
00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:50.470
That's what you said to me.
I said that the cause usually steamed broccoli.

842
00:56:50.471 --> 00:56:55.180
It smells like farts and it tastes like shit and it's not,
but yours tasted good.

843
00:56:55.450 --> 00:56:57.310
I don't know how you prepare it.
You didn't?
No.

844
00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:00.970
You didn't say good at the time you go.
No,
it doesn't taste like shit.

845
00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:04.810
And I was like,
wow,
what a stellar review.
I could have worded it differently,

846
00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:08.470
but it doesn't taste like shit.
No,
I meant that.
It tastes good.

847
00:57:08.471 --> 00:57:13.471
It doesn't taste like shit and then this is as bad as it used to.

848
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:19.090
All right,
let's take a quick break when you won't know.
We took a break.

849
00:57:19.091 --> 00:57:23.590
We'll be back in mere milliseconds with the great miss pat joining us.

850
00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:27.100
She's beautiful.
This is your

851
00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:32.680
first door.
Alright,
we're rolling right now.
Just so you know.

852
00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:33.613
<v 10>Oh,</v>

853
00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:40.703
well

854
00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.500
that's interesting because we were talking about

855
00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:58.460
you got to give her some more volume.
I actually,

856
00:57:58.461 --> 00:58:01.490
I think she's not even plugged up.
That'll help.
Oh yeah,
it will help.

857
00:58:02.850 --> 00:58:07.150
Definitely give her some I hear now.

858
00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:12.903
Did you hear that?

859
00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:20.700
[inaudible] I promise you,

860
00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:33.650
you're the,
you're the only person to lose that game.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

861
00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:38.750
She came in,
she was within one of wanting the whole thing.

862
00:58:45.010 --> 00:58:49.940
Juicy,
juicy,

863
00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:57.060
juicy.
How did you come up with that?

864
00:58:57.340 --> 00:59:00.740
Call me juicy all the fucking time.

865
00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:02.760
<v 0>Speaking of nicknames,</v>

866
00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:09.090
the new book comes out later this month is called rabbit and I was curious about

867
00:59:10.081 --> 00:59:11.810
that.
And then I'm reading the book.
Uh,

868
00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:15.780
it's your autobiography and you mentioned that you got the nickname rabbit

869
00:59:15.781 --> 00:59:17.460
because I think it was,
it was your grandfather.

870
00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:19.750
<v 10>No,
my stepfather stepfather's</v>

871
00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:21.980
<v 0>Curtis.
Came home one day.
Saw you like no</v>

872
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:24.620
<v 11>one on a,
on a carrot.
And he was like,
you eat a lot of those.</v>

873
00:59:24.621 --> 00:59:27.430
Your eyes going to be pretty.
That's the biggest fucking liar.

874
00:59:29.610 --> 00:59:33.800
Who am I eat my eyes blue and we eat my eyes blue because I want it when I was a

875
00:59:33.801 --> 00:59:37.170
key for some reason,
you know Jerry before Jerry curls.
Yeah.

876
00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:40.700
So I really wanted to be white cause if you're in the book,
you really want,

877
00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:42.440
you know,
you leave it to beaver.
Right?

878
00:59:42.441 --> 00:59:45.100
So I wanted my hair because my mom wouldn't come my fucking hair and I figured

879
00:59:45.101 --> 00:59:47.520
if I had that kind of hair,
this is before we'd,
yeah,

880
00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:50.720
I could straighten it out and we would get a Jerry curl once a year and once Yo

881
00:59:50.721 --> 00:59:54.830
get Jared Carol 30 90 days old,
that's it.
You fucking got an African Afro.

882
00:59:55.410 --> 00:59:59.510
So,
uh,
so I wanted to,
I wanted to straighten my hair and I could,

883
00:59:59.590 --> 01:00:01.130
I forgot to fuck what I was about to say.

884
01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:06.250
Oh by having blue eyes and blue eyes and I want it to be white and you know,

885
01:00:06.261 --> 01:00:08.870
cause leave it to beaver.
Had a perfect family,
eat them,

886
01:00:08.871 --> 01:00:13.250
cares and your eyes be pretty.
Hey somebody who fucking cares.
My tick,
my,
my,

887
01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:18.280
my nose got strong from biting into them with my eyes and turn blue and my head

888
01:00:18.651 --> 01:00:21.620
and straight.
Now it's like a,
it's an amazing,

889
01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:24.990
amazing job that you did with the book.
Thank you.

890
01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:29.090
It is like a roller coaster of there's parts that are just like heartbreaking

891
01:00:29.091 --> 01:00:32.870
and like,
I mean you're like,
you know,
the struggle that you went through in your,

892
01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:36.820
in your youth.
It is heartbreaking.
I mean,
you know that like reading it,

893
01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:40.070
I mean there's,
there's parts that like you're kind of know you're,

894
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:42.770
you're happy for that.

895
01:00:42.771 --> 01:00:47.771
You find your way through it and there's these moments of joy and things that

896
01:00:47.851 --> 01:00:51.800
you could,
but like,
it's,
it's heartbreaking to read about,
you know,

897
01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:55.310
the struggle you went through.
Do you know what's good about it?

898
01:00:55.311 --> 01:00:58.840
I think it's a balance.
You know,
one minute you crying the next me like this,

899
01:00:58.850 --> 01:01:00.380
this is crazy.
Then you laugh.

900
01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:03.950
I don't want to like give away too much.

901
01:01:03.951 --> 01:01:08.870
But you know that your grandfather's story,
I don't know.

902
01:01:08.871 --> 01:01:13.820
Do you want to talk at all about them?
I mean it's just
bad ass.

903
01:01:15.350 --> 01:01:17.110
I saw him on a regular every weekend,

904
01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.090
choke the shit out of people and throw them out the door.

905
01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.530
This isn't given up too much because this,
I mean,
so your,

906
01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:29.210
your grandfather basically ran a bootleg house,
a bootleg house,

907
01:01:29.211 --> 01:01:32.870
which was like,
you know,
if you want to place that doesn't shut down,

908
01:01:32.871 --> 01:01:33.860
that serves drinks,

909
01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:38.180
you can go to this house and your dad and your granddad has moonshine.
And like,

910
01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:40.580
people could just kind of wild out and have a good night.
Right.

911
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:45.190
And then in Friday and Saturday was a club.
There's a club back then.

912
01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:48.530
Everybody did the album.
So everything,
the music helped my,
you know,

913
01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:52.070
my mom was a Dj to keys,
get in the flow and dance.

914
01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:54.890
I fucking hated it because you were literally,

915
01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:58.560
he would never put you out unless you act like a fool and he don't look Jay.

916
01:01:58.890 --> 01:02:01.490
Other than that,
you could get drunk.
You didn't,
you didn't have to dry.

917
01:02:01.491 --> 01:02:04.000
Just sleepover.
You wake up,
you next it.

918
01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:07.720
Who the fuck are you pourable the work,
you know,
there's,

919
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:11.660
there's different things that you read that make you feel and think of different

920
01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:11.901
ways.

921
01:02:11.901 --> 01:02:16.420
But one of the things was the idea of being a kid and having strangers asleep in

922
01:02:16.421 --> 01:02:20.850
the house that seemed like that would suck.
Right?
Like today it was suck,

923
01:02:20.851 --> 01:02:23.340
but you know,
that was my environment.
You know,

924
01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:26.460
I would never have it happen to me.
But when that's your environment,
that's all,

925
01:02:26.461 --> 01:02:28.650
you know,
like going some way.
He's like,

926
01:02:28.651 --> 01:02:31.230
what the fuck them people ain't got no shoes when they don't know shit about

927
01:02:31.231 --> 01:02:34.560
shoes.
So you wake up next to some drunk mother fucker where he,

928
01:02:34.690 --> 01:02:38.430
you won't wake up and you roll over it.
Oh,
I'm sorry.

929
01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:46.920
Yeah,
it was,
it was the norm,
the norm until I got out of that environment.

930
01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:50.160
So it wasn't scary because nine times out of 10 you knew the drunks.

931
01:02:50.161 --> 01:02:54.050
They came every week.
You know,
it's the truth.
What you're saying.
Sorry,
I don't,

932
01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:57.720
I mean,
yeah,
when you grow up in something that's so bananas,

933
01:02:57.721 --> 01:03:00.720
which are Your Life Story is so bananas,
you don't know at the time,

934
01:03:00.721 --> 01:03:03.960
then it's nutty until you grow up and you start raising your own children,

935
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:07.650
I'm assuming.
And I'm like,
what the fuck was that about?
You know,

936
01:03:07.651 --> 01:03:12.640
the biggest shock to me when I,
uh,
and I'm moving past it,
a little bootleg house,

937
01:03:12.641 --> 01:03:17.340
we could come back.
But when we grew up,
we were so poor and we ate chicken back.

938
01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:21.210
You know,
off the back is the little ass.
They're like a chicken nugget.

939
01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:25.920
So we ate that shit every week,
the chicken.
So when I grew up in,
I was like,

940
01:03:25.921 --> 01:03:30.921
y'all don't eat chicken and nobody ate chicken and that was Paul people,

941
01:03:30.991 --> 01:03:33.530
chicken nuggets.
That was a shocker to me.
Right,

942
01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:37.500
because chicken nas was good until you realize it was a search thing is chicken

943
01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:42.240
and I threatened my keys,
I'll tell is like Ashley Fry up you a batch of chicken.

944
01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:45.960
There's,
there's a sale chicken as an Atlanta by the pound.
Really?

945
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:49.480
So that was a shocker to me that the crap we ate and that was a treat

946
01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:55.050
that was bought at a chicken.
You were supposed to eat it.

947
01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:58.980
My mom used to fry up cow brains all the time and give it to me.

948
01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.920
That's a Hungarian thing.
And I was like,
what the fuck is this?
And she told me,

949
01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:05.820
I was like,
never again.
But that was,
that was cheap I guess.
Cal Brands.
Yeah,

950
01:04:05.821 --> 01:04:08.520
I mean,
and then they make it taste so good.
Like chitlins I won't eat,

951
01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:11.790
I won't eat nothing that remind me of being poor.

952
01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:15.870
I worked too hard to get away from that crowd.
Yeah.

953
01:04:15.871 --> 01:04:20.040
I can't eat no spam and I can't eat no cheese,
no cheap brand.
My husband's like,

954
01:04:20.041 --> 01:04:23.820
you are the most bougie person I know.
I go to Mcdonald's,
say make my food hot.

955
01:04:23.821 --> 01:04:26.400
He's like,
Pat,
this is Mcdonald's.
I don't care.

956
01:04:27.450 --> 01:04:30.360
But I mean I worked too hard.
I cannot eat.

957
01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:34.530
I go down the aisle and I see a certain type of food.
It makes me angry.

958
01:04:34.531 --> 01:04:36.870
Spans make me angry.
Nasty though.

959
01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.240
Well not back in the day cause we didn't have bacon.

960
01:04:39.241 --> 01:04:42.930
So you fry that up with some grits.
Awesome.
Fat Back.
That was a good meal.

961
01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:46.900
But ketchup sandwiches.
The ketchup sandwiches.
Yeah.

962
01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:51.540
And it was never named brand kitchen was watery stuff and went and soggy the

963
01:04:51.541 --> 01:04:55.980
bread or sugar sandwich.
Manet Sandwich.
Yeah.

964
01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:58.700
My kids don't know anything about that.
Do you actually

965
01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:06.960
eat chick filet?
All of life.
There's so many good things in the book,

966
01:05:06.961 --> 01:05:11.960
but I love the honesty with which you talk about everyone in the family.

967
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:17.440
A lot of people wouldn't be honest about it,
Tom.

968
01:05:17.441 --> 01:05:20.780
It was hard because when you be in a,
you know,
it wasn't a t.

969
01:05:20.781 --> 01:05:23.800
I became an adult that I realized it's stuff that I really went through,

970
01:05:23.801 --> 01:05:25.090
the abuse that I went through.

971
01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:28.770
And one thing I learned from this book when you been on a lot of people being

972
01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:33.520
abused,
want to protect their abuser and that was the in the right ahead.

973
01:05:33.521 --> 01:05:37.480
And tell me your p two people out.
Celt protect.
It was her father,

974
01:05:37.481 --> 01:05:40.310
my first kid's father and I protected my mom and it's like,

975
01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:44.740
don't write them like that.
He was,
and she was like,
pat is to truth.
I said,

976
01:05:44.830 --> 01:05:46.660
but I don't want people to think of my mom and like,
oh,

977
01:05:46.661 --> 01:05:47.381
I don't want them to think,

978
01:05:47.381 --> 01:05:51.040
because she was saying he's a pedophile and I was like,
he's not a pedophile.

979
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:53.170
He was my boyfriend.
She was like,
oh,
excuse me,

980
01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:57.030
you was 12 and he was 21 or you was your,

981
01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:00.760
you gave birth at 14 and I think he was 22 or something like that.

982
01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:04.690
It was an eight year difference.
He,
I know.
All I know is I was 14 she was like,

983
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:08.350
that's a pedophile.
So Ah,
that was my baby daddy.
She was like,
no pet,

984
01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:09.340
they didn't protect you.

985
01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:14.260
So that was really hard for me to [inaudible] to,

986
01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:18.100
cause I kept putting up walls.
I mean obviously it made it in,

987
01:06:18.101 --> 01:06:20.440
but like so was it her that convinced you?
Yes,

988
01:06:20.441 --> 01:06:23.980
she had to sit me down and made me realize that these people did not protect me.

989
01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:29.050
We cry so much with this book.
Really.
We cried.
That was time.

990
01:06:29.051 --> 01:06:32.600
I would tell her stuff and I could just hear break up in a voice,
you know,

991
01:06:32.650 --> 01:06:35.950
I gotta call you back.
And then she was like,
you know,
cause I'm full,

992
01:06:35.951 --> 01:06:40.900
I'm 15 with two babies by a married man.
And she was like,
what the hell?

993
01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:45.790
The sea.
And you know what's crazy?
He signed the birth certificates and no,

994
01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:48.670
do you need no damn id to sign the birth certificate?

995
01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:52.990
Even in 1986 in 1987 you need a birth certificate.

996
01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:55.780
And I mean,
I'm not a burst.
If you needed an ID,

997
01:06:55.930 --> 01:07:00.930
he walked in as a grown man and sign a kid who just had a kid birth certificate

998
01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:02.950
and nobody questioned it.

999
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:05.980
So when she started bringing all this stuff to my attention,
because I lived it,

1000
01:07:05.981 --> 01:07:10.650
I really never paid it.
It made me so angry.
I was like,
this shit.

1001
01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:13.030
They just,
they didn't give a crap about me.

1002
01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:18.330
They literally did not give a crap about me and that stuff kind of,

1003
01:07:18.521 --> 01:07:20.850
it really,
it really,
Emma,

1004
01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:23.920
it really bothered me because I never thought about it because when I had her,

1005
01:07:24.070 --> 01:07:27.190
I'm 14 years old,
driving out in the eighth grade.

1006
01:07:27.250 --> 01:07:28.780
I don't want it to do with survive.

1007
01:07:28.810 --> 01:07:32.050
All I wanted to do was keep us from being molested,
keep her from dropping,

1008
01:07:32.051 --> 01:07:34.450
not survive.
So I went to selling dope.
I mean,

1009
01:07:34.451 --> 01:07:38.680
I can admit with $40 but I had to steal it because when I tried to get a job and

1010
01:07:38.681 --> 01:07:42.820
I was 15 nobody would give me a job and I would literally tucked him on an

1011
01:07:42.821 --> 01:07:45.610
interview one day and say,
this is my job.
This is my work permit.

1012
01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:48.510
Ashland Nikea meet them.
But then it was like,
y'all ass idea,

1013
01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:52.360
you supposed to be in school,
but you know that that was the hard part for me.

1014
01:07:52.361 --> 01:07:56.800
It was just all about surviving was making the transition into selling dope.

1015
01:07:57.970 --> 01:08:02.410
Was it difficult at all or no,
they did it.
They daddy was selling drugs first.

1016
01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:05.590
So you know,
he got a divorce because I had the second baby.

1017
01:08:05.590 --> 01:08:07.840
So he went on to the next girl,
like he always did.

1018
01:08:08.110 --> 01:08:12.120
And so he started selling drugs,
but he was still paying my rent and you know,

1019
01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:15.890
I was so young and dumb as long as I was number one.

1020
01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.380
The rest of the holes didn't matter what,

1021
01:08:18.381 --> 01:08:20.450
he never lived with me and they live with somebody else,

1022
01:08:20.451 --> 01:08:24.140
but I always told me I was number one.
So he started selling drugs.

1023
01:08:24.150 --> 01:08:27.740
He was paying my bills.
So I kinda agreed to the range me,
okay,

1024
01:08:27.741 --> 01:08:32.480
you know what you needed to,
I sort of keep your baby alive and or feed them.
So,

1025
01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:34.070
and I mean,
I'm too young to get a job,

1026
01:08:34.071 --> 01:08:38.300
but he got locked up and that's when I was like,
I really had to survive.

1027
01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:42.200
And at that time I was only 16 when he went to jail for selling drugs.

1028
01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.930
At first I went to the projects because that's why all the jokes were so far

1029
01:08:47.931 --> 01:08:51.230
from where you were though.
No,
I wasn't that far.
My girlfriend had a friend.

1030
01:08:51.290 --> 01:08:56.290
My girlfriend had a boyfriend who was a drug dealer and we went over there and I

1031
01:08:56.331 --> 01:08:59.060
will try to sell.
It was just too many people.
There's too much competition,

1032
01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:02.610
so I ended up back in my own neighborhood,
which was up on a corner.

1033
01:09:03.350 --> 01:09:04.760
I posted up at a friend house.

1034
01:09:04.790 --> 01:09:08.420
I went over to some old friend's house that I grew up and got the whole family

1035
01:09:08.421 --> 01:09:09.254
to sell drills.

1036
01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:15.700
<v 10>Even their Christian Mama,
I'll never forget the day she got burned.</v>

1037
01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:19.920
He got busted by the police.
They took a fake leg off and found out a dope.

1038
01:09:22.710 --> 01:09:26.800
The police put handcuffs on her ass home.

1039
01:09:27.690 --> 01:09:32.070
<v 11>I love 'em.
I love you know the stories about you guys,</v>

1040
01:09:32.130 --> 01:09:37.080
your mom discovering the church too.
Oh yeah.
I tell you,

1041
01:09:37.081 --> 01:09:38.010
I was so naive.

1042
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:43.070
I had no idea that she was only supposed to be baptized once until no lie.

1043
01:09:44.041 --> 01:09:45.180
About five years ago,

1044
01:09:45.181 --> 01:09:48.700
I was on the phone with my friend and we was talking about baptism and um,

1045
01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:51.840
I was like,
she said,
I said,
yeah,
well we got baptized.

1046
01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:54.570
I got baptized like 20 sometimes I think it's 25

1047
01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:57.170
<v 10>she said,
wait a minute.
I was like,
well,
she's like,</v>

1048
01:09:57.410 --> 01:10:01.310
who the Hell Baptize you 25 times?
How many times you've been baptized?

1049
01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:05.580
She was like,
once I said,
who the hell I baptize you was going to hae?

1050
01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:11.780
So she said what?
What happened?
And then I remember I was like,

1051
01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:12.751
oh my gosh,

1052
01:10:12.751 --> 01:10:17.090
she was running a scheme because we would just show up at different churches and

1053
01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:20.210
you like,
keep your fuck,
keep your fucking mouth shut.
Don't ask no questions,

1054
01:10:20.211 --> 01:10:24.280
just get in this water.
I get this check and we get the fuck up Outta here,
man.

1055
01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:28.370
She went to literally open the phone book and hit different churches,

1056
01:10:28.371 --> 01:10:31.430
give them that Sas.
But that's back when churches cared about you too.

1057
01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:35.680
And when she discovered the White Churches,
oh,
she lost her damn mind.

1058
01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:37.851
Yeah.
You know,

1059
01:10:37.851 --> 01:10:41.930
back in the 80s you guilty white people want to make sure that day that they get

1060
01:10:41.931 --> 01:10:43.950
into heaven.
Let me help this poll.
Black family,

1061
01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:51.480
you know,
you go to a black child,
a like one item at the Pantry,
Mitch,
one item.

1062
01:10:53.170 --> 01:10:55.340
Oh the whole patches get what you want.
God.

1063
01:10:56.170 --> 01:11:00.040
So he called my Mama with three checks and I bet her wallet already.

1064
01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:03.470
God is good all the time.
They shut the fuck up dude.
Throwing shit now.

1065
01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:07.340
We were sure.
Where does she,
I hated it.
I'm like,
Mama,

1066
01:11:07.341 --> 01:11:09.640
how long we got to do must've

1067
01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:13.920
<v 11>been like salvation though.
It was,
he helped her with the rent.
It helped with me.</v>

1068
01:11:13.921 --> 01:11:17.430
No,
it's a fool's game.
Yes.
I mean we hit those different churches.

1069
01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:21.990
That's how we ate.
Yeah.
That's how we ate.
And we would drive,
you know,
out,

1070
01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:25.050
cause you know,
you had to join a church back then to,
you know,

1071
01:11:25.051 --> 01:11:29.340
to get baptized and get help.
So I,
we had a lot of members,
Sheila pay no time

1072
01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:31.970
<v 0>is there was like,
one of the things too is like,
you know,</v>

1073
01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:36.050
writing is good writing and good storytelling when you go,

1074
01:11:36.051 --> 01:11:38.630
I don't know the experience,

1075
01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:41.600
but you still feel it when you talk about how,

1076
01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:47.020
you know when you were a kid and you're watching commercials for food and like

1077
01:11:47.421 --> 01:11:49.760
you could only dream about it,
you know,

1078
01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:54.530
I didn't have that experience but I could like step into what you were feeling.

1079
01:11:55.090 --> 01:11:57.140
Yeah.
I can step into your world and be like,
oh,
he's like,

1080
01:11:57.141 --> 01:12:01.730
you're so poor that you don't have access to even go to Mcdowell.

1081
01:12:01.731 --> 01:12:03.520
Your mom's like,
black people don't eat McDonald's.
No,

1082
01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:05.680
she's a Niggas don't leave me.
I said it there.

1083
01:12:07.970 --> 01:12:08.803
<v 10>They</v>

1084
01:12:10.710 --> 01:12:15.060
tech is a MAG Nigga.

1085
01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:21.170
Nigga down a dash 10 when I eat a burger and they never ate a burger.

1086
01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:23.510
You're so right.
It was his dad dance as well.

1087
01:12:23.511 --> 01:12:28.190
I really thought black people didn't eat McDonald's whenever she didn't want to

1088
01:12:28.191 --> 01:12:32.870
buy shit.
A Nigga don't do that.
Don't do that.
Don't do to help you like pink too.

1089
01:12:32.871 --> 01:12:35.000
Like,
okay,
we don't do that.
That's a crazy

1090
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:38.780
<v 11>Cigna grow up with,
which is just like culturally we don't do that.</v>

1091
01:12:38.781 --> 01:12:41.660
So where there are lots of things that by the time you became an adult that you

1092
01:12:41.661 --> 01:12:42.950
kinda had to unlearn all that,
right?

1093
01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:47.810
<v 10>Yeah.
When I became a drug dealer,
I went straight to Mcdonald's.
First</v>

1094
01:12:52.810 --> 01:12:57.630
Burger King
was,
he never said she couldn't afford it.

1095
01:12:57.631 --> 01:12:59.280
She just said,
we didn't do it.
We didn't do it,

1096
01:12:59.310 --> 01:13:01.440
which is different things then I can't afford it.

1097
01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:04.840
<v 0>You hear that as a kid and like your parents telling you,
you're like,
oh,
okay.</v>

1098
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:07.720
That's the way reality is.
Yeah.
That you said,
yeah,
that's like,
oh,

1099
01:13:07.721 --> 01:13:09.290
I didn't know that.
Okay.
That's what we're supposed to know.

1100
01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:11.260
What I think is really wonderful about your book,

1101
01:13:11.261 --> 01:13:13.480
and I think why people are going to be drawn to it.

1102
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:15.490
It's because the white people,

1103
01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:20.400
<v 10>why people buy,
why people are like,
why people are going to enjoy people blaring.</v>

1104
01:13:21.150 --> 01:13:25.250
<v 11>Um,
is that you always liked to read other people's fucked up shit first of all</v>

1105
01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.890
because then you can go,
oh my God,
at least my shit wasn't that fucked up.

1106
01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:31.570
But also to go,
hey other people,
shit is fucked up.
Yes.

1107
01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:36.230
And the fact of it is more people have fucked up lives then have good lives.

1108
01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:39.000
Yes.
Uh,
cause I do another podcast called that's deep bro,

1109
01:13:39.001 --> 01:13:42.280
where I talk about my life and,
and people writing in or like,
oh Mike,

1110
01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:44.750
I didn't know anyone else had the same shit that you had growing up.

1111
01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:48.050
And that's why the stuff like this is so valuable.
Not only is it funny,

1112
01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:50.300
but they get to know somebody.

1113
01:13:50.301 --> 01:13:53.600
You who has transcended this past and look at you now.

1114
01:13:53.601 --> 01:13:56.840
Like you have a great family,
you're successful,
you're a great comedian.

1115
01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:00.470
Like to see you on the other side of it I think is really cool too.
Yes.

1116
01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.750
And that's all I wanted people to realize.
No matter what isn't,

1117
01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:06.890
it's not about how you start,
it's about how you finish.
Yup.
Mean,
you know,

1118
01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:09.470
I don't think all white people had an easy life.

1119
01:14:09.471 --> 01:14:13.150
Just like all black people in all Chinese an ever.
There's,
there's,
there's,

1120
01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:18.220
I think there's a struggle in every,
in every nationality.
That's what I learned.

1121
01:14:18.221 --> 01:14:21.760
Like I thought only black teenagers got pregnant cause that's all I saw.

1122
01:14:21.970 --> 01:14:23.950
I didn't see why people use the case worker,
the fucking,

1123
01:14:24.190 --> 01:14:27.550
the police officer who dropped off food buy a house because he knew my mom was

1124
01:14:27.551 --> 01:14:30.070
an alcoholic.
That's the only white people I saw.

1125
01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:34.870
So I thought when I got pregnant in hood,
only black kids get pregnant.

1126
01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:39.340
That makes sense.
Then when I started doing comedy,
because you know,

1127
01:14:39.341 --> 01:14:41.770
I changed when I changed my life,
I share all of this shit off.

1128
01:14:41.770 --> 01:14:43.710
I don't know shit about to get on.
I don't know how,
I don't know.

1129
01:14:43.711 --> 01:14:47.870
No new dance and new music and nothing,
nothing.
That's what she remembered.

1130
01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:53.590
The dances,
what?
I cut it all off and when I,
when I started doing comedy,

1131
01:14:53.591 --> 01:14:57.070
people from all walks of life would come up to me.
It was like,
oh Ms Pat,

1132
01:14:57.850 --> 01:14:59.350
I went through the same thing I never get,

1133
01:14:59.351 --> 01:15:02.940
I saw this white lady and her husband had on an ascot.
He anytime y'all ass guy,

1134
01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:05.300
he's supposed to have money and just assume that person.

1135
01:15:06.130 --> 01:15:08.440
And she whispered in my ear and she said,

1136
01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:13.660
I had my baby at 15 and the bitch had on a ring beginning of my fucking eyeball.

1137
01:15:14.170 --> 01:15:16.780
And I was like,
are you for real?
She's like,
yes,

1138
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:20.440
I had my baby at 15 thank you for telling your story.

1139
01:15:20.650 --> 01:15:24.610
And that made me realize we all go through the same shit.
It's,

1140
01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:27.390
some people are just scared.
I was in Atlanta,

1141
01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:31.120
New Year's and this black girl said I had my baby at 15 to,
she said,

1142
01:15:31.121 --> 01:15:34.630
but I'm a shame.
How can you talk about it?
I said,
cause bitch,
I don't care.

1143
01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:38.560
I don't care what nobody think of me.
She was like,
you brain cause I could never,

1144
01:15:38.561 --> 01:15:41.050
she said,
I don't even tell my child my age.

1145
01:15:41.051 --> 01:15:43.810
That's how I don't give a fuck with my kids.
Think about me.
They don't feed me.

1146
01:15:43.811 --> 01:15:46.860
They grown.
Fuck them.
I can't five Texas for my kids.

1147
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:50.390
I don't give a fuck about me.
I mean,

1148
01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:54.140
I kept him from getting pregnant.
Yeah.
I was like,
Wah,
Wah,

1149
01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:59.170
Wah pregnant,
getting pregnant.
I think I beat her gay.

1150
01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:08.680
I was like,
stay away from this.
Stay away from debt.
I was like,
God damn.

1151
01:16:08.681 --> 01:16:10.170
That's what I'm saying.
Get a little bit of deep,

1152
01:16:13.410 --> 01:16:17.140
you know.
Uh,
she say she was [inaudible] she was gay about fourth grade.
Right?

1153
01:16:17.141 --> 01:16:21.430
Ashley?
She say fourth grade,
but she saw a lot too.

1154
01:16:21.431 --> 01:16:25.090
So I don't know if it was a bad relationship between me and her daddy when she

1155
01:16:25.091 --> 01:16:27.250
saw a man just constantly beating on a woman

1156
01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:36.190
actually goes,
no.
I'm like,
yeah,
I'm gay.

1157
01:16:36.191 --> 01:16:38.860
Actually sitting behind us on the couch for those of us who are watching on

1158
01:16:38.861 --> 01:16:39.850
youtube.
Yeah.

1159
01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:44.290
So you know what the strange thing when she came I gay,
you know,

1160
01:16:44.291 --> 01:16:48.300
I had already been to jail,
did time and I really didn't like gay women.

1161
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:51.640
Gay Men's is okay.
But I did not like get nobody raped me or anything.

1162
01:16:51.641 --> 01:16:55.360
I just didn't like gay women.
And so I say what you don't like,

1163
01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:58.860
God put it in your life.
And when she came she ran off and you know,

1164
01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:02.020
quit school and we,
we,
we didn't have a relationship.

1165
01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:06.000
And then one day I finally found after two or three years not talking to her,

1166
01:17:06.001 --> 01:17:10.130
I was like,
what's your problem?
Are you gay?
And she said,
well come on home bit

1167
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:11.660
<v 10>you,
it's a lot of pussy here in Atlanta.</v>

1168
01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:15.160
We've been friends ever since.

1169
01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:19.810
And then she tried to help me help all get home.

1170
01:17:23.770 --> 01:17:27.650
No,
I'm not hooking it up.
Okay.
I'm not looking at it though.

1171
01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:32.020
That's strictly on her.
When I was you get to eat,
there's old work

1172
01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:36.870
<v 12>we've been talking about.
We wanted to show you,
first of all,</v>

1173
01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:42.950
this is a which one first you want to do the,
yeah.

1174
01:17:43.150 --> 01:17:44.940
So it's fine.
Your opinion on something.

1175
01:17:45.150 --> 01:17:50.150
This man is teaching guys who,

1176
01:17:50.371 --> 01:17:51.204
uh,

1177
01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:56.160
who want more control over their orgasms,

1178
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:59.370
how to sharpen their knife.
They penises.

1179
01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:04.820
So the women practice on the egg.
What did the men do?
Okay,
the man,

1180
01:18:04.821 --> 01:18:07.100
the first thing,
oh,
hail housing.

1181
01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:10.860
They would call sharpening their nice,

1182
01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:15.600
and this is what he says you have to do.
So the whole case,
you'd get an oil,

1183
01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:20.720
we caught the baby oil oil and you put it in and now you put the peanuts to warm

1184
01:18:22.691 --> 01:18:25.080
up in the cold winter.
You warm them up,

1185
01:18:25.290 --> 01:18:30.290
you get a hot power and you'll make it a one and you put here,

1186
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:34.810
make sure all the blood flow.
Now you get the penis out,

1187
01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:38.870
you pull the skin.
A lot of people,
they never succumb fences.

1188
01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:40.080
So they had the skin.

1189
01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:43.960
So you pull the skin and you get up and he'll run like this.

1190
01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:46.590
The rap rap,
rap,
rap,

1191
01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:50.780
especially on the Klan Penis rubbed them the gland.

1192
01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:56.490
Okay.
You met them strong and not sensitive.

1193
01:18:56.670 --> 01:19:01.110
Now he's saying that he wants like an order to build up that control.

1194
01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:06.470
You need to Rub your Dick 350 times 50

1195
01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:11.900
<v 10>he got me when he's,
they pulled the skin bag.
Who pulled us came back.</v>

1196
01:19:12.130 --> 01:19:13.330
That's your grandpa penis?

1197
01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:23.790
Yeah.

1198
01:19:25.330 --> 01:19:28.970
<v 12>Right side.
Left side.
Front foot.</v>

1199
01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:34.880
With the time,
Dow.
Okay.
How often am I doing this?

1200
01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:38.980
Do you have to do every day until you can control every day.

1201
01:19:39.670 --> 01:19:42.730
So this guy's obviously shitting his pants.
He's telling him,

1202
01:19:42.731 --> 01:19:46.900
this guy is saying that he jerks off basically 350 strokes a day every day.

1203
01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:51.810
<v 10>Well,
he,
the control is keep yourself from nothing.
Yeah,
I'm sorry.</v>

1204
01:19:51.811 --> 01:19:54.630
I'm going to use the wrong word.
Calming.
Yeah.

1205
01:19:56.130 --> 01:19:59.550
After a week of doing that shit,
you shouldn't be able to call him.
You should be.

1206
01:19:59.551 --> 01:20:04.260
So you put,
you're rubbing it to the right,
rubbing it to the level upstairs.

1207
01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:12.600
Johnny's
got an invisible penis,

1208
01:20:12.601 --> 01:20:16.360
Neda rubbing away.
It's a lot of rubbish.
I've got a set of balls,
that's all.

1209
01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:21.390
Maybe that's why he can rub,
rub so much.
He's so smart.

1210
01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:25.750
<v 12>Putting the knife.
Okay.
All right.
Have you done traveling the night?</v>

1211
01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:28.150
There's the number one.
Number two,

1212
01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:33.720
you have to learn how to contracting the prostate gland because this guy is also

1213
01:20:35.391 --> 01:20:38.270
saying that when you have as a man,

1214
01:20:38.330 --> 01:20:43.280
when you feel the orgasm coming,
stop and feel it internally,

1215
01:20:43.281 --> 01:20:47.990
but don't release it.
It's a lot to ask.
I don't know nothing about that.
Yeah,

1216
01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:52.220
I have a penis.
So is that like stopping a piece in Mc ash?
It kind of thing.

1217
01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:55.700
So people cannot separate and they,
they don't know at the squeeze on Anna's,

1218
01:20:55.730 --> 01:20:58.930
that's it don't work.
So when we can track the faucet,

1219
01:20:59.070 --> 01:21:03.200
because male g spot is in process,

1220
01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:08.610
right?
So when you contract the prostate gland in the front and you feel energy

1221
01:21:08.670 --> 01:21:12.090
activate here,
so as you contract and you feel here accurate,

1222
01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:17.070
not when many circulation,
the pressure of the declaration.

1223
01:21:17.130 --> 01:21:21.900
If I'm the prospect and contracting,
okay,
so I'm exercising,
I see assignment.

1224
01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:26.010
Okay.
And Far people have project land stolen or problem.

1225
01:21:26.250 --> 01:21:28.200
This one who solved their problem.
Okay.

1226
01:21:28.230 --> 01:21:33.230
Just that contraction 300 times you need to do 300 that old Chinese man problem

1227
01:21:34.891 --> 01:21:38.160
is right.
He don't eat too much of that fucking fake rice.
And John,

1228
01:21:39.330 --> 01:21:42.690
he's crazy.
He's nuts.
He's crazy.
I just think he's a pervert.

1229
01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:46.890
And who likes to Jack His dick a lot.
And then he's like,
here's my method.
Yeah,

1230
01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:49.470
he's tried to make you more money,
but he's just like a dude.

1231
01:21:49.471 --> 01:21:52.320
It likes to jerk off a lot and now he's turning it into like a thing.

1232
01:21:52.321 --> 01:21:56.190
When I'm a guru,
until you feel and hit listen to this area,

1233
01:21:56.380 --> 01:22:01.050
I'm going to throw it out.
The guy,
some without ejaculation.
What?
Watch.

1234
01:22:01.051 --> 01:22:05.010
So you feel so you see when you do,
when?
When you get it,

1235
01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:09.330
it's very quick to two times can.
No

1236
01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:11.690
<v 10>piece of the cheeks.
He pees in the cheek.</v>

1237
01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:16.410
He is paying in vagina.
They need to rest is says,
isn't this?

1238
01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:19.490
He thinks he's super miss parent.
I hate him.
I hate him.

1239
01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:23.420
What would you make love to him?
No Chinese.

1240
01:22:23.421 --> 01:22:27.230
First of all I did.
I'm assigned my race,
but I don't go all the way over there.

1241
01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:30.530
What's your race spectrum?

1242
01:22:31.410 --> 01:22:36.270
<v 12>Does black just black so far?
You would never go.
Wait.
Oh</v>

1243
01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.950
<v 10>I don't.
Yeah,
I guess what</v>

1244
01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:43.900
White Mans are not into Dick.
Black.
Blue.
They don't even like fat.

1245
01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:49.180
That's not true.
There's black guys.
The black guys love,
I'm sorry.
White,
white,

1246
01:22:49.210 --> 01:22:50.560
white men is they,
they,
they,

1247
01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:54.160
that's why you usually see fact girls were white meat.
So,
I mean,

1248
01:22:54.161 --> 01:22:55.480
I've never had a white man.

1249
01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:58.600
<v 12>Did he throw me really ever.
Right.
That's hard to believe.</v>

1250
01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:04.230
<v 10>Do since these pocket,
they think I'm cute.
I want to fuck me.</v>

1251
01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:06.160
You know,
back in the day,

1252
01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:09.280
<v 11>no.
Oh,
not about.
Okay.
But the Rab Rab Guy,</v>

1253
01:23:09.281 --> 01:23:13.210
what if I were to offer you $100,000 cash to do what?

1254
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:14.650
To have sex with him to what?

1255
01:23:14.651 --> 01:23:16.990
You sleep with the rope rope Gafa a hundred thousand dollars.

1256
01:23:20.730 --> 01:23:24.390
No,
I don't.
It will be easy because he really got no peanuts.

1257
01:23:24.391 --> 01:23:28.630
I don't be sticking right in my navel cause he's kind of deep and would think he

1258
01:23:28.631 --> 01:23:32.750
getting it.
So I take your hundred thousand dollars upon.
Yeah.

1259
01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:38.730
So can I fix her mic?
It's killing me.
Yeah.
What's really quick?

1260
01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:42.790
Just a v the visual part on Oh yeah.
Yeah.
You want to see her?
Beautiful.
Okay.

1261
01:23:42.791 --> 01:23:47.740
That was a quick grab.
So you would never date a Chinese guy.
Huh?

1262
01:23:47.830 --> 01:23:52.630
That's not going to happen.
There's very small.

1263
01:23:52.631 --> 01:23:55.180
So what I'm gonna do with them using for a Tampon?

1264
01:23:58.210 --> 01:24:02.500
No,
I don't think so.
I mean,
I don't think the old beyond his own.

1265
01:24:02.770 --> 01:24:07.340
I probably could do a white man first,
but I've never seen a Chinese guy that,

1266
01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:09.400
you know,
I thought was a track that I'm quite sure they,

1267
01:24:09.410 --> 01:24:12.190
I don't think I'm attractive either.
No,
that's honest.

1268
01:24:12.250 --> 01:24:16.180
Let me think about days we always in and out.
They're still buying hair in one.

1269
01:24:16.181 --> 01:24:20.530
Never hit on me.
We always in a shit,
I'm black hair.

1270
01:24:20.531 --> 01:24:22.120
Prato cause I've never seen one.

1271
01:24:22.230 --> 01:24:25.360
<v 0>Was it like that?
Was it a Asian owned?
Uh,
in Atlanta?</v>

1272
01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:27.260
<v 11>Everywhere.
Everywhere.
It's always,</v>

1273
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:30.400
they don't tell you what to get there hugging hair from.
They would not tell you.

1274
01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:34.260
Oh my God,
really?
They will not sell out if you're not Asian,
you can't buy hair.

1275
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:38.900
<v 0>I was fascinated by that.
Uh,
Chris Rock documentary.
Yeah.
Good hair.</v>

1276
01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:42.620
That was really,
really insightful.
I had no idea.

1277
01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:45.810
<v 11>Black woman,
we spend a lot of money on their hair.
It was crazy.</v>

1278
01:24:45.811 --> 01:24:50.790
I got about 500 on this file.
Yeah.
Cause the front is on lace.
Oh,

1279
01:24:50.791 --> 01:24:53.690
what does it call Ashley Lace?
Frontal.

1280
01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:57.390
So it cost like one 51 75 something like that.

1281
01:24:57.391 --> 01:25:02.240
And it thins out quick.
So about three hairdos you need another one in the back.

1282
01:25:02.290 --> 01:25:07.250
Um,
it was Bondo,
so spent about 400,
three,
400 barrier.

1283
01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:09.050
It's just thousands and thousands of dollars.

1284
01:25:09.051 --> 01:25:11.700
It could be you get the good hair that last you a whole year,

1285
01:25:11.790 --> 01:25:13.400
so all you got to do is replace the front.

1286
01:25:13.401 --> 01:25:18.210
But if I'm doing TV as on my whole novels,
five,
$600.
Yeah.
But it hurts.
Yeah.

1287
01:25:18.211 --> 01:25:21.800
And to have the,
cause you have to braid the hair under,
correct.
Yeah.

1288
01:25:21.870 --> 01:25:25.650
That's under,
that does not hurt or you get used to the pain.
Well,
um,
I'm very,

1289
01:25:25.651 --> 01:25:26.870
I used to be very telling the heated,

1290
01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:30.580
but I've done it so much that it doesn't hurt as much anymore.
Yeah.

1291
01:25:30.690 --> 01:25:34.230
And is it keeps the damage off your real,
how to,
you know,
like we can't,

1292
01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:37.410
we can't straighten out hair like that every day.
Yeah.
We can't curl our hair.

1293
01:25:37.411 --> 01:25:39.570
Like the sheet I do today is,
hey,
you can't do it.

1294
01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:40.600
<v 0>That's so funny.
That word.</v>

1295
01:25:40.601 --> 01:25:44.410
A tender headed because I feel like I would be like that.
You know,

1296
01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:46.330
like I have sensitive scalp.
Okay.

1297
01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:50.340
<v 11>You know what I have?
They have a lace front of me is now you seen that?</v>

1298
01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:52.330
Are you saying that you get it?
I should try it.
No.

1299
01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:56.390
Have you seen it as we showed him the picture is fucking wow for dudes.

1300
01:25:56.540 --> 01:26:01.280
Why m black means it is the most craziest shit you could be having sex in your

1301
01:26:01.281 --> 01:26:05.300
hands slip off and your man Hell slip too.
But it looks so real now.

1302
01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:07.730
I'm telling you the barbers are doing it.

1303
01:26:07.731 --> 01:26:12.350
You got men's doing me and lay fries should do at Tom.
At least look into it.

1304
01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:14.270
Yeah,
I'll look.
I Nate and once they put it on you,

1305
01:26:14.271 --> 01:26:18.500
they give you a haircut with it.
So everybody's faking Atlanta.
Yeah.

1306
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:22.190
You can't even fucking tell who got the fake hair to man or the woman.
Wow.

1307
01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:26.690
You're talking about speaking of Atlanta?
Uh,
Tyler Perry.
Yeah.
Gay or straight.

1308
01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:32.240
Oh No,
stop it.
He got a baby.
Stop it.
No,

1309
01:26:33.170 --> 01:26:36.230
he do have a baby.
Are you doing at the Tyler?
Why are you going to do that?

1310
01:26:36.231 --> 01:26:39.680
Because I feel like it's a big,
it's like a secret,
not secret.

1311
01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:43.250
Monique just came out with audit and miss.
Somebody was gay.
I don't know.

1312
01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:46.500
Monique did you to see out a big thing.
You don't own the Internet shit.

1313
01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:51.260
Here is Tom.
They're putting a weave on him.
Oh my God.

1314
01:26:51.261 --> 01:26:55.910
Holy Shit is deep.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
This guy looks really good.

1315
01:26:55.970 --> 01:26:59.390
Oh Wow.
That looks,
Huh?
But it's also like in the,

1316
01:26:59.750 --> 01:27:03.080
you know how when videos are shot,
you're like,
oh,
this looks good on the video.

1317
01:27:03.230 --> 01:27:07.600
I don't know.
No,
I've seen men's with it.
Really?
Yeah,
it is the bomb.
All right.
Oh,

1318
01:27:07.601 --> 01:27:10.810
there you go.
You don't get long hair like that guy.
I'm going to come.
No,
no,

1319
01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:13.700
he's going to cut it.
They're going to cut it into a haircut.
Oh,
okay.
Oh,

1320
01:27:13.701 --> 01:27:15.680
so they put it in and then now they'll do it.
Okay.

1321
01:27:16.190 --> 01:27:18.170
And how long would it stay like his hair like this?

1322
01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:19.720
<v 13>You got to keep getting it redone</v>

1323
01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:26.540
<v 11>once a week.
Once a week.
Oh,
it's glued down.
Yeah,
it's a lot of upkeep.</v>

1324
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:29.210
It's a lot of,
I could see like meeting someone,

1325
01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:31.760
you start dating and then you're like,

1326
01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:35.940
just keep your secret and then all of a sudden it's like year and a half later

1327
01:27:35.941 --> 01:27:38.480
and y'all go swimming and you're fucking happy.
Fall off.

1328
01:27:39.530 --> 01:27:41.180
Um,

1329
01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:46.630
I haven't been going to AA meetings every Wednesday getting my hair.
Well,

1330
01:27:46.631 --> 01:27:50.240
what about somebody would have fake ass.
So you know,
she got a compressor.
Yeah,

1331
01:27:50.241 --> 01:27:54.110
that's true.
Yeah.
You did it.
And he was white.
He was white.

1332
01:27:56.830 --> 01:28:00.680
He man,
we kicked him out.
Yeah,
he was.
He's cute.
I'm telling you.

1333
01:28:00.681 --> 01:28:03.320
That's the new shit.
Now when you sat down Ms Bower,

1334
01:28:03.330 --> 01:28:04.970
I think we're just right before we started rolling.

1335
01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:09.920
You said that I was regular white and,
and let's start.
Let's talk about that.

1336
01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:13.580
What are the levels of what?
Yeah,
tell us about why people is,
is like,

1337
01:28:13.581 --> 01:28:17.630
you guys are regular white.
Okay.
I don't think other race of people scare you.

1338
01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:22.820
Right.
Then you got that off,
then you got that uh,
uh,
unconnected white.

1339
01:28:22.850 --> 01:28:26.270
Just only see white people.
Right?
Right.
Yeah.
So when they see other people,

1340
01:28:26.271 --> 01:28:27.470
they start sweating and shit.

1341
01:28:27.650 --> 01:28:30.850
I start thinking about everything they see on the TV band and a movie thinking

1342
01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:34.190
is motherfuckers act a who home run up on him and do the shit they scene in the

1343
01:28:34.191 --> 01:28:37.880
movie.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Then you got to white.
That's the rear rear rich people.

1344
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:41.540
One of the execs I said,
hey,
your son has a cute will you get them from,

1345
01:28:41.690 --> 01:28:42.800
she's asking you a link.

1346
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:46.080
So I learned is don't ask race people where the fuck they get the shits though.

1347
01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:51.530
$650.
That's more than two of my car note was put together.

1348
01:28:51.531 --> 01:28:55.450
That's a bit tired at the wall.
I was insulted.
I was like

1349
01:28:57.210 --> 01:29:01.410
a pole personal link for some sound does dumb shit was automatically became ugly

1350
01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:05.100
as fuck to me if she,
um,
I think we're in that,
in that situation,

1351
01:29:05.101 --> 01:29:06.000
if somebody goes like,

1352
01:29:06.090 --> 01:29:09.000
that's just nice that you got and you know how much it costs,
you should be like,

1353
01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:13.770
yeah,
I forget where I got like in hood,
but they don't want you to go get it.

1354
01:29:13.790 --> 01:29:17.070
Right.
Right,
right.
You know,
they want to be the shot of him.
I'll fucking hood.

1355
01:29:17.090 --> 01:29:21.750
That's right.
If you know,
he's like,
oh,
it was about 600 and you turned me out.
Oh,

1356
01:29:21.751 --> 01:29:24.930
okay.
What did they good for?
You don't see me know Lincoln,
you know,

1357
01:29:24.931 --> 01:29:26.130
you got to open up a link.

1358
01:29:26.131 --> 01:29:31.131
Can you talk about what you're doing as far as I thought I put pilot.

1359
01:29:31.921 --> 01:29:35.040
Well I was on a podcast,
Allah,

1360
01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:39.630
you guys together and uh,
a guy from imagine heard me,

1361
01:29:40.170 --> 01:29:42.960
he heard me out for where the book came from,
all of you guys.

1362
01:29:42.961 --> 01:29:47.200
And he heard me on a mark Marin and some other ones.
He hurt.
And um,

1363
01:29:47.670 --> 01:29:51.990
he took me over to where I hooked up with Lee Daniels because Lee has a deal

1364
01:29:51.991 --> 01:29:56.650
with Fox with 20th
or for those who don't.

1365
01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:59.850
So Empire,
uh,
the Butler and pressures.

1366
01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:04.800
And so we took it lead Daniel Imagine in Maine in 20th,

1367
01:30:04.801 --> 01:30:08.190
took it to Fox and they bought a put pilot saying that they would shoot the

1368
01:30:08.191 --> 01:30:10.980
pilot and if they like it,
they'll pick it up from series.

1369
01:30:11.310 --> 01:30:14.490
And it is the hardest shit I have ever done in my life.

1370
01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:16.560
What do you mean when you say hardest?
What is it?

1371
01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:20.490
What do you mean by a lot of back and forth?
That I'm not used to,

1372
01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:23.010
you know what I'm saying?
Start over,
start over.
I'm like,

1373
01:30:23.011 --> 01:30:27.270
what the fuck is wrong with you people?
Yeah,
that's it.
That's the thing.

1374
01:30:27.310 --> 01:30:29.880
It's just,
you know,
I don't like this.
Why you don't like this?

1375
01:30:29.881 --> 01:30:32.730
Then you got to explain stuff and they still don't get it.
And then,
you know,

1376
01:30:32.731 --> 01:30:34.300
I don't,
I'm not a TV exec.

1377
01:30:34.350 --> 01:30:37.010
I just know you say you want to do a show about me is pat.

1378
01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:39.690
All I know is Miss Pat.
I don't know this other shit.

1379
01:30:39.691 --> 01:30:44.010
You talking about the show then followed?
Like is it you right now?
Is it me now?

1380
01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:48.690
I mean moving into a,
uh,
uh,
me leaving Atlanta,
moving into,

1381
01:30:48.691 --> 01:30:51.550
I'm a all white conservative neighborhood.
Gotcha.
You know,

1382
01:30:51.670 --> 01:30:55.910
opinionated and you know,
do what I do in my real life.
Kids grow up my,

1383
01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:59.740
if you do that,
that show will be shot out here,
I assume,
right?
Yeah.

1384
01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:04.530
It'd be shot here.
And Are you guys about to start shooting?
Are we well,

1385
01:31:04.531 --> 01:31:07.860
I had a writer,
it didn't work out,
so we just got the writer who did everybody.

1386
01:31:07.861 --> 01:31:11.310
Hey Chris.
So we have a meeting tomorrow.
Hopefully they'd tell us,

1387
01:31:11.311 --> 01:31:14.090
go write the pilot stage.
We've been trying to get back to.

1388
01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:17.310
So once we do that hopefully was shooting out out.

1389
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:21.480
It's exciting work to me.
You know what?
I come from a world,

1390
01:31:21.481 --> 01:31:23.970
well this is how I taught myself.

1391
01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:28.980
Don't believe half the shit you hear half the shit you see and none of this shit

1392
01:31:28.981 --> 01:31:32.790
you here,
right?
Yeah.
So it ain't real to me until I put it in my hand.

1393
01:31:33.090 --> 01:31:37.440
This book ain't real.
It's real now.
But people that all you got a book,
Bitch,

1394
01:31:37.470 --> 01:31:40.110
I don't know.
They could tell them.
The first time I wrote,
we wrote the book,

1395
01:31:40.111 --> 01:31:43.170
they say put it in the trashcan and started all that shit blew my mind.

1396
01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:46.640
I was like,
bitch,
I need that money.
I started a layaway.
Uhh,

1397
01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:50.190
I've already spent the money,
but I can't get the money.

1398
01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:53.300
So that shocked the hell out of me.
You know,
wait,

1399
01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:56.800
you wrote it once and they said throw it away.
I started out,
I was like,

1400
01:31:56.910 --> 01:31:58.230
it was a great decision,

1401
01:31:58.231 --> 01:32:01.930
but at the time I couldn't understand because I got so mad.
Oh my God,

1402
01:32:01.931 --> 01:32:04.480
I got so mad.
I was like,
I wasted a year of my life.

1403
01:32:04.481 --> 01:32:08.530
And you're gonna tell me to start over.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
I Wa I was ready.

1404
01:32:08.531 --> 01:32:11.520
I was fired.
Or they had to calm me down.
Really?
Yeah.

1405
01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:12.720
Cause I'm running well from you.

1406
01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:16.090
Like the publisher that says that it was the editor.
They go,

1407
01:32:16.150 --> 01:32:18.970
this is just not working.
Well,
she says,
not working.
It's too dark.

1408
01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.820
We had to take out some things where you're writing some things,
but I tell you,

1409
01:32:21.821 --> 01:32:25.840
once I calmed down and we finished this book,
that was the best fucking ideal.

1410
01:32:26.130 --> 01:32:28.720
Really.
At the time you added concede,
you know,

1411
01:32:28.721 --> 01:32:31.660
I couldn't see what she was talking about,
but now it made the book,

1412
01:32:32.050 --> 01:32:36.490
her idea really made the book better.
The further the pages just turn on it now.

1413
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:40.560
It just,
yeah,
it was too dark.
It was a little too dark.
Yeah.

1414
01:32:41.050 --> 01:32:43.530
We didn't want the audience to put the book down and go fill.

1415
01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:46.090
Sorry for this little black girl standing together.

1416
01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:49.600
I want you to take these horrible stories and laugh at him the way we wrote
them.

1417
01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:53.440
Yeah.
I want you to say,
okay.
All right.
All right,
Ms. Pay you fucking up again.

1418
01:32:53.490 --> 01:32:55.900
Yeah,
I'm cheering for,
you know,
you laugh and then you cry.

1419
01:32:55.940 --> 01:32:59.090
I want all type of emotions and that's what this book got now.
Yeah.

1420
01:32:59.110 --> 01:33:02.650
At first you probably would have got through the first 30 pages and been crying

1421
01:33:02.651 --> 01:33:04.750
like I'm over Gil.
Oh,
you're white guilt.

1422
01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:08.230
I'm so over it.

1423
01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:12.280
So we wrote out all the white guilt and that's a great,

1424
01:33:14.250 --> 01:33:18.940
yeah,
I sure hope so.
God Dang.
So,
you know,
it made it a better book.

1425
01:33:18.941 --> 01:33:22.900
But you know,
the whole TV thing is,
is is,
is the hardest thing I ever done.

1426
01:33:22.930 --> 01:33:25.370
It really is.
Yes.
Because I mean,
I,

1427
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:29.680
I pretty much raised myself so I don't take no for an ounce of it.
Right.

1428
01:33:29.681 --> 01:33:32.290
Because I knew how to get out there and hustle and do what I need to do.

1429
01:33:32.530 --> 01:33:35.380
But then you got these other people who's calling shots in your life.

1430
01:33:35.650 --> 01:33:39.790
Desta Desta thing for me,
that's the thing I don't like.

1431
01:33:39.791 --> 01:33:44.140
I don't like you telling me what to do.
Sure.
Eh,
you know,
it's their money.

1432
01:33:44.141 --> 01:33:47.320
They're going to tell you what to do,
that you're going to stay at the hotel.

1433
01:33:47.321 --> 01:33:49.750
They say you're going to do this,
you're going to do that.
And then it,

1434
01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:53.200
they're wonderful me.
They treat me,
they treat me really fucking good.

1435
01:33:53.201 --> 01:33:56.080
I feel guilty cause we ain't got to show and I feel like I'm taking their money.

1436
01:33:56.110 --> 01:33:57.790
Right,
right,
right.
But you know,

1437
01:33:57.820 --> 01:34:01.570
the whole thing is that right now I can't call the shots.

1438
01:34:02.110 --> 01:34:04.360
You know that they listen to my opinion.
Yeah.

1439
01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:08.380
But ultimately their decision make a decision.
They make making this show.

1440
01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:11.920
So that's the thing that really gets me.
I understand that.
Yeah.

1441
01:34:12.140 --> 01:34:16.870
But it sounds like a whole like corporate culture to that.
As a comic,
especially,

1442
01:34:17.230 --> 01:34:17.561
you know,

1443
01:34:17.561 --> 01:34:21.610
we bypass a lot of that corporate bullshit because we perform live for a living

1444
01:34:21.611 --> 01:34:24.340
and you don't have to deal with it.
So when you have to deal with it creatively,

1445
01:34:24.341 --> 01:34:28.950
it's so fucking frustrating.
All the,
you know,
circle back,
put a pin in it.
Yeah.

1446
01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:29.993
Uh,
you know,

1447
01:34:30.510 --> 01:34:34.120
<v 5>and I first read it spicing twins 14 when I was having sex with my girlfriend</v>

1448
01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:35.130
and her sister,

1449
01:34:35.130 --> 01:34:40.130
she had this really strong smell of Os out pretty enjoyable and arousing.

1450
01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:47.220
It kind of smelled like this rich odor of body sweats combined with the smell of

1451
01:34:48.551 --> 01:34:52.460
shit basically.
What are you thinking of?
I would

1452
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:56.580
<v 11>tell you did,
it was,
we had a,
my granddad had a customer,
he,</v>

1453
01:34:56.581 --> 01:35:00.080
he's a childhood friend of my Mama.
He grew up,
he grew up,

1454
01:35:00.081 --> 01:35:02.900
his name was Tom Aaliyah.
Never forget it.
You know,

1455
01:35:02.901 --> 01:35:05.760
down south we got them thick acids.
Yeah.
So he would cook,

1456
01:35:05.930 --> 01:35:08.950
he'd be like back back here or big jaws.
I they called my granddad

1457
01:35:09.130 --> 01:35:13.890
<v 10>give me a cup of ice.
Said you woke up.
Okay.</v>

1458
01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:17.170
No,
they will pick out him so bad cause he couldn't say eyes.
Right.

1459
01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:22.280
You always ask for a couple of days.
Yeah.

1460
01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:26.460
<v 11>This conversation about,
you know,
dudes are obviously bigger pigs,
you know,</v>

1461
01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:29.250
like men in general.
Are you know,
animals.

1462
01:35:29.490 --> 01:35:33.210
So this guy is talking about how he gets aroused by smells like funky smells on

1463
01:35:33.211 --> 01:35:36.960
women.
You think women ever have that same thing?
Christina Says No.

1464
01:35:37.050 --> 01:35:39.660
I mean it'd be a,
you have to be a real fucking savage woman.

1465
01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:42.870
The average woman's like not wired this way,
I would say.

1466
01:35:42.900 --> 01:35:44.010
What do you think Ashley?

1467
01:35:45.450 --> 01:35:46.190
<v 14>Yeah,</v>

1468
01:35:46.190 --> 01:35:49.140
<v 11>Lasker.
Oh,
you aroused by funky smell vaginas?</v>

1469
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:50.263
<v 14>No.</v>

1470
01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:55.790
<v 11>What about,
what about a real stinky ass?
Yeah.</v>

1471
01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:56.633
See,

1472
01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:58.890
<v 10>look like you like sticky as ash.</v>

1473
01:35:59.210 --> 01:36:00.920
<v 11>Well,
that's what this guy just said.
Just so you know.</v>

1474
01:36:00.921 --> 01:36:05.240
We're not just throwing that at you.
This guy said that he likes a stinky ass.

1475
01:36:05.241 --> 01:36:05.540
You know?

1476
01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:09.230
<v 5>I know it sounds disgusting,
but it smelled really nice to me.</v>

1477
01:36:09.260 --> 01:36:13.020
I really liked the smell.
Is that weird?
We stopped because the scheme,

1478
01:36:13.110 --> 01:36:14.640
<v 10>they just mail me on the wrong day.</v>

1479
01:36:19.930 --> 01:36:24.750
Yes.
Yeah.
That stuff,

1480
01:36:24.810 --> 01:36:27.590
right?
Oh yeah.
He just hates me right now.

1481
01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:31.800
He's smelling that on that all high school.
Vagina.
Yeah.
He's male.
A vagina.

1482
01:36:31.801 --> 01:36:32.920
And I had a couple of baby down.

1483
01:36:32.921 --> 01:36:36.440
She didn't only seven peed on the pen and locker.
I guarantee changing

1484
01:36:38.090 --> 01:36:40.660
<v 5>even gets aroused by other like this.
Check out this smell.</v>

1485
01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:43.180
Remember that Uranian Gold I met last year in Japan,

1486
01:36:43.450 --> 01:36:46.690
the one I asked if she wanted to have sex with me and she said No.
Well,

1487
01:36:46.691 --> 01:36:49.550
one of the main reasons why I felt so attracted to her,

1488
01:36:49.551 --> 01:36:52.000
it wasn't because I thought she was pretty or cute.

1489
01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:55.060
It was because she had this amazing smell of armpits.

1490
01:36:55.270 --> 01:36:59.800
Every time she sat next to me and my room,
I could smell this strong,
rich,

1491
01:36:59.830 --> 01:37:02.950
bitter smell of arm pit.
And it was really arousing.

1492
01:37:04.330 --> 01:37:05.280
He like [inaudible].

1493
01:37:05.670 --> 01:37:10.000
<v 11>Yeah.
And Stinky ass holes.
He likes our faith and assholes.</v>

1494
01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:14.830
It's,
yeah.
He was in Japan and the,
I guess an Iranian girl was there.
Oh Wow.

1495
01:37:14.831 --> 01:37:19.480
He need to go get a couple of them.
All was people named has ramped up.
Oh yeah.

1496
01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:22.540
Well,
uh,
you know,
Middle Eastern.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1497
01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:25.390
I wonder what he'd like it out the day.
Yeah.
He may be carrying a trip.

1498
01:37:25.930 --> 01:37:28.630
Maybe should go to Saudi Arabia.
They were black too.

1499
01:37:28.631 --> 01:37:31.600
A lot of them in the middle of summer.
So she's,
they're assholes.

1500
01:37:31.610 --> 01:37:35.770
Have to be very smelly,
sweaty,

1501
01:37:35.771 --> 01:37:38.920
stinky ass hole.
I want to do the women have on close up on it here.

1502
01:37:38.980 --> 01:37:41.200
They do so cause I yes they do.

1503
01:37:41.230 --> 01:37:45.850
And a lot of them are wearing like Chanel and Dior and they're very wealthy.

1504
01:37:45.851 --> 01:37:49.720
Like some of these uh,
Saudi ladies.
But then they have to cover it out in public,

1505
01:37:49.721 --> 01:37:53.710
but then they know amongst themselves the whole culture of like what you got on

1506
01:37:53.711 --> 01:37:56.130
under there,
bitch.
And then they,
yeah,
now

1507
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:58.800
<v 0>I got to shop.
I love the shop to play for you.</v>

1508
01:37:59.190 --> 01:38:04.140
Do you think this is a white woman or a black woman?
Okay.
Oh,

1509
01:38:04.150 --> 01:38:07.500
this one's good.
Yeah.
Why didn't you please hear Charlie honey?

1510
01:38:14.010 --> 01:38:14.843
<v 15>Yeah.</v>

1511
01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:19.260
<v 10>Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Get your passenger</v>

1512
01:38:23.090 --> 01:38:26.950
gets you past that was a fucking white woman.
Fucking hillbilly.

1513
01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:32.860
Oh,
well first of all,
I know she,
she's white.
Yeah,
you were no black person.

1514
01:38:32.861 --> 01:38:36.870
They'll say get to pass.
And they be like,
Yo,
that Nigga,
you know.

1515
01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:42.540
<v 2>Right.
We'll be all up in their head.
That was black bird.</v>

1516
01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:46.210
That was a fucking passenger.
You know,
we should ask Ms Pat.

1517
01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:50.290
Remember that girl we had last week who was dropping n bombs left and right.

1518
01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:55.040
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
We had this debate.
Do we,
do we have her on?
Yes.

1519
01:38:55.210 --> 01:38:59.620
Yes.
Watch this video and I dunno,
let's start there.

1520
01:38:59.621 --> 01:39:04.480
Is there ever a time when it's okay for a white person to drop the n bomb?

1521
01:39:04.481 --> 01:39:07.320
Like if let's say they hang out with this person,

1522
01:39:07.410 --> 01:39:10.890
<v 0>get real comfortable,
like real comfortable.</v>

1523
01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:14.010
You just hear you watch,
oh,

1524
01:39:16.170 --> 01:39:19.360
<v 10>stop.
She looked,
she looked though has shown a phone.
She started recording,</v>

1525
01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:20.780
you said,
right?

1526
01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:25.320
<v 0>Yeah.
But have you seen this already?
Yeah,
she was dating a black guy,
so yeah.</v>

1527
01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:26.590
That's why she feels she's right.

1528
01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:29.840
<v 2>That's the whole thing.
So I actually said,
if you can hear her,</v>

1529
01:39:29.841 --> 01:39:31.220
that she's dating a black guy.

1530
01:39:31.221 --> 01:39:33.950
This is the white lady we played last week who's driving in bumps and Ashley

1531
01:39:33.951 --> 01:39:37.050
says she's dating a black guy.
So she feels like she can write,
right?
Yeah.

1532
01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:39.520
Play it.
I haven't seen it.
Oh right.

1533
01:39:39.710 --> 01:39:43.820
<v 16>Hmm.
That's the bat.
Malia come in and my little pause for my Nigga.</v>

1534
01:39:44.530 --> 01:39:48.890
Guess what?
Boom.
At the end of the day,
I'm still going to go home to my Nigga,

1535
01:39:49.340 --> 01:39:53.110
fuck him and get my pussy ate while you hose.
Just saying,

1536
01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.903
<v 0>okay.</v>

1537
01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:00.860
<v 10>Oh,
I ain't gonna beat the Shit.
I didn't.
How was she getting it down?</v>

1538
01:40:05.370 --> 01:40:08.400
<v 0>This is by the way,
at the beginning of it dropped like a hundred</v>

1539
01:40:09.450 --> 01:40:12.210
<v 16>Oh,
you and your dog was sad as fuck bitch.</v>

1540
01:40:12.510 --> 01:40:16.560
Why would you wish that's what somebody,
you don't know.
There's this real sad,

1541
01:40:19.090 --> 01:40:22.920
maybe it's in my head.
Go down.
Might be a little fit.

1542
01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:24.660
Never claimed to be steady.

1543
01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:29.090
<v 10>Oh,
she real black.
She's,
she blacker than me.</v>

1544
01:40:29.650 --> 01:40:33.780
She tapped the MIPS in.
This bitch is black.
I mean you,
what?

1545
01:40:33.781 --> 01:40:38.070
Can you say what a white girl got?
She got this bitch.
How clone some nickel.
Yeah,

1546
01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:41.020
she's on cloud as lady.
She played,

1547
01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:45.460
I mean she got the neck twist and look at a lymph node we were talking about.

1548
01:40:45.490 --> 01:40:49.560
That's just how familiar and like how she,
yeah,

1549
01:40:50.050 --> 01:40:52.600
she more than Black Dick.
Yeah,
right.

1550
01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:57.050
<v 16>I see it on Steve.
Sanjay and I don't see nasty bitch ass.</v>

1551
01:40:57.740 --> 01:41:00.890
What the other one that I forgot.
I forgot her name.
You ever live in any way?

1552
01:41:00.891 --> 01:41:04.820
But I see.
Okay,
fine too.
I don't care what race you are,
Babe.
I'm not racist.

1553
01:41:05.090 --> 01:41:06.860
Them bitches just got me fucked up.

1554
01:41:07.130 --> 01:41:09.080
But it's just the black bitches that's talking.

1555
01:41:09.230 --> 01:41:11.450
So that's why I said black bitches.

1556
01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:15.960
<v 11>Do you think she's ever,</v>

1557
01:41:16.290 --> 01:41:19.600
that's probably why she's talking shit like this because she's never had a
fight.

1558
01:41:19.630 --> 01:41:22.120
Like she's never had her ass.
What she gonna know?
She gonna get her ass beat.

1559
01:41:22.330 --> 01:41:25.750
She don't get her now she will.
He probably going to beat her ass.
Well,

1560
01:41:25.751 --> 01:41:30.070
it just amaze me because I'm looking at a white girl,
but I'm hearing a system.

1561
01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:34.260
Right?
I mean she got the demeanor all down so she,

1562
01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:36.850
she could really play that.
That game.
I play with you

1563
01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:43.740
when you cheated on me,
but I mean she would really fool people,
right?
Yeah,

1564
01:41:43.741 --> 01:41:46.120
she will.
She got it down.
But

1565
01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:55.930
<v 16>bitches in this group.
No.</v>

1566
01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:02.430
<v 11>Hmm.
Wait.
So,
okay,
so this is the debate is like,</v>

1567
01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:06.930
she culturally,
that's like a Rachel Dole is all,
yeah,

1568
01:42:06.940 --> 01:42:10.810
that whole bag of worms.
Okay.
Culturally,
she identifies this way,

1569
01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:14.470
but is it ever okay?
No,
it's never.
Okay.

1570
01:42:14.830 --> 01:42:17.980
Because if she was standing in a group and don't care how much you my friend,

1571
01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:23.260
you cannot,
you can't say that.
You think she would?
Uh,
no,
no,
no.

1572
01:42:23.261 --> 01:42:25.870
Let me tell you something about when the white people say nigger.

1573
01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:31.690
Honestly we feel it.
I mean it's like no.
Listen,
we feel it.

1574
01:42:31.691 --> 01:42:32.230
Like if you,

1575
01:42:32.230 --> 01:42:36.070
if you stuck your hand on a hot stove for some reason when it comes out of a

1576
01:42:36.071 --> 01:42:39.460
concave,
Caucasian mouth,
anybody other than black,

1577
01:42:39.670 --> 01:42:41.140
like we do it just a throwaway.

1578
01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:45.940
But when you say he hurt it fucking hurts.
I totally believe you.

1579
01:42:46.030 --> 01:42:48.550
I totally believe now she's all black.
I don't feel it.

1580
01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:57.330
No.
But you think,
would you say that hurt the hurt thing?

1581
01:42:57.740 --> 01:43:02.140
Like I totally believe that.
Do you feel like it's different when somebody,

1582
01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:04.450
does it hurt when somebody is trying to,

1583
01:43:04.451 --> 01:43:08.410
trying to appropriate and like drop it casually like,
Oh,

1584
01:43:08.411 --> 01:43:10.600
you know what I'm saying?
Like when when someone drops it like that,

1585
01:43:10.930 --> 01:43:14.950
you still feel,
you still feel like pain,
her contact she,
that would be that.

1586
01:43:14.951 --> 01:43:17.470
What you're saying.
Yeah.
You will see that will upset and be like,

1587
01:43:17.471 --> 01:43:20.220
what are you doing that,
yeah.
Yeah.
It was like,
it will be,
we will,

1588
01:43:20.290 --> 01:43:24.220
it will feel like race racism.
Yes.
We will feel it casually.

1589
01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:27.790
I mean if you're doing it me,
no matter what we feel it.
Yeah.

1590
01:43:28.670 --> 01:43:30.250
And it's crazy.
It is crazy.

1591
01:43:30.340 --> 01:43:33.100
And I think he's just passed down through our ancestral,
through slave.

1592
01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:37.690
We feel that pain from that word and you know,
we have,

1593
01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:40.120
I have shit to do with slavery,
but it's just,

1594
01:43:40.121 --> 01:43:43.480
it's automatically hate when it comes out of somebody else's mouth.

1595
01:43:44.050 --> 01:43:47.470
And I think the reason why we say it so much because it was sad,

1596
01:43:47.471 --> 01:43:50.020
tall ancestor so much and it was saying to,
you know,

1597
01:43:50.021 --> 01:43:54.590
in the 60s and stuff to hurt her so much.
Now we finally got control of the word.

1598
01:43:54.591 --> 01:43:58.040
Sure.
Yeah.
And now you saying nobody ever told white people they can't say it.

1599
01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:00.080
It's not just the law to say it.

1600
01:44:00.650 --> 01:44:03.600
I guess after enough margin and ass kicking wipe you,

1601
01:44:03.601 --> 01:44:06.190
she doesn't realize well we don't go and let y'all had it were,

1602
01:44:06.710 --> 01:44:08.950
well some of them,
some of them,
some of them.

1603
01:44:09.250 --> 01:44:12.770
The way we go in now with our administration is free to do whatever the hell you

1604
01:44:12.771 --> 01:44:14.350
want to do even.
Oh God.

1605
01:44:18.290 --> 01:44:21.130
<v 10>That's what I just thought.
But I based the low,
lower my mom and Laura.</v>

1606
01:44:21.730 --> 01:44:26.260
What's her accent?
Where is she from?
What part?

1607
01:44:26.261 --> 01:44:27.240
Like not Atlanta

1608
01:44:27.630 --> 01:44:32.280
<v 11>tend to see Alabama.
Alabama.</v>

1609
01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:37.060
I heard Atlanta,
but yeah,
she could be Georgia too.
She's a diva.
She Dee Dee.

1610
01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:40.800
What I was telling her was that I thought if she lived in Georgia,

1611
01:44:41.010 --> 01:44:45.000
she lived like 40 miles outside of Atlanta.
You know like she lived.
No,

1612
01:44:45.001 --> 01:44:47.010
she could be right down in the west end where I grew up at.

1613
01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:50.830
I mean she got the demeanor,
the nic road,
that's how they talk nail.

1614
01:44:50.831 --> 01:44:54.720
So South Fast Lik you know,

1647
01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:59.180

1648
01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:05.070
Yeah,

We became barbecue once.
She,

1649
01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:06.750
but it'd be decorated.
It'd be,

1650
01:47:06.751 --> 01:47:09.590
I went to a white barbecue and that she was laying,
I said,

1651
01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:11.340
would he move and white photo on there?

1652
01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:14.820
So what the fuck y'all cook meat with?
No.

1653
01:47:14.821 --> 01:47:19.300
Fucking see is how are we doing wrong?
And used to be,
oh my God,

1654
01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:22.500

Don't now.
So now when I go to white barbecue,

1655
01:47:22.650 --> 01:47:25.380
I just bring my own seat and on my phone when I ain't,
don't Cook my shit,

1656
01:47:25.410 --> 01:47:27.060
I'm going to season it up and throw it on the grill.

1657
01:47:27.450 --> 01:47:30.060
Ain't nobody got time for that.
Yeah,

1658
01:47:31.530 --> 01:47:33.930
Can I ask you a question about present real quick?
Yeah.

1659
01:47:34.350 --> 01:47:36.720
Was it at all like orange is the new black

1661
01:47:44.010 --> 01:47:47.730

I tell you,
when I was in jail it was this a Moffa die.

1662
01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:52.420
And so you gotta remember I was like 1819 and Notifica Moffa dyke was what was a

1663
01:47:52.421 --> 01:47:55.470

1664
01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:56.950

1665
01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:02.450
I'm fucking up to her because I was fucking words.
So she,

1666
01:48:02.850 --> 01:48:06.240
I walked in the room one day and she would eat and digging her down with a

1667
01:48:06.241 --> 01:48:07.230
little dick and I said,

1668
01:48:09.190 --> 01:48:12.570
they ate so much pussy in jail.
Oh my God.

1669
01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:14.940
If you one gay day was going to turn you gay,

1670
01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:17.970
they didn't fuck with me because I fought all the time.
I fought.

1671
01:48:18.030 --> 01:48:22.320
All the guards were calling eating each other out.
No,

1672
01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:27.060
they ate.
It was so much pussy eating and now I'm telling you you can't.

1673
01:48:27.210 --> 01:48:31.850
It will.
It blew me away.
I didn't even know really know what gay women did on TV.

1674
01:48:31.851 --> 01:48:35.190
I got to prison.
Really?
You walk in a room with one,

1675
01:48:35.191 --> 01:48:39.300
got another one in the both for teenagers in each somebody else's mouth.

1676
01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:44.640
Y'All just cool with this.
This is a good way to kill time.
I,
I couldn't get on.

1677
01:48:44.790 --> 01:48:45.181
They put,

1678
01:48:45.181 --> 01:48:48.120
they give you that Koolaid shit and they put this shit to keep your vagina from

1679
01:48:48.121 --> 01:48:52.770
jumping around.
But that shit didn't have,
you know they give you that drink.

1680
01:48:52.771 --> 01:48:56.040
They keep you from getting horny wage came out.
Yeah.
They give you,

1681
01:48:56.041 --> 01:48:58.860
they put something in your drink because why does it keep you from getting in

1682
01:48:58.861 --> 01:49:03.500
women's prisons?
Yeah.
Women and men.
That's shit he need.
You ever heard of?
Yeah.

1683
01:49:03.770 --> 01:49:06.330
It must not have been drinking enough of that shit man.

1684
01:49:06.330 --> 01:49:07.710
They will eat and each other to death.

1685
01:49:07.900 --> 01:49:10.710
That's the thing that bothered me more because it was nothing to you.

1686
01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:13.470
You will have somebody watch out and they will go at it.

1687
01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:16.860
They had origins and everything I was in,
I was in,

1688
01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:19.620
my roommate was a crackhead that I used to,
she was in jail.

1689
01:49:19.890 --> 01:49:24.630
She kept going to Jeff,
a prostituted in drugs so she could sing her ass off.

1690
01:49:24.631 --> 01:49:28.230
But the WHO and that bitch got clean.
She's the same Meta sleep every night.

1691
01:49:28.231 --> 01:49:31.080
Whitney,
Mary j Blige.
That bitch could say,

1692
01:49:31.210 --> 01:49:35.670
I got to tell you this story is kind of gross.
So we love growth.
Look.

1693
01:49:35.671 --> 01:49:40.350
So I had never used a tampon in my life.
Right.
So in jail they give you tampons,

1694
01:49:40.860 --> 01:49:43.830
more tampons and pads.
So I was like,
I don't know how to use the templates.

1695
01:49:43.860 --> 01:49:45.030
So you share your room with your woman?

1696
01:49:45.180 --> 01:49:48.590
I don't stop the court ball and their family and I'm walking off.

1697
01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:50.800
Oh my hurts so bad that my roommate was like,

1698
01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:54.130
I was wondering when you going to take the core board I cause that's,

1699
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:58.240
she said I saw you when you put it in there,
but I didn't want to tell you what

1700
01:50:01.380 --> 01:50:04.710
now
I was,
oh my,

1701
01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:08.280
my thing was beat up like I had been at my thing on my back,

1702
01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:10.000
like plies.

1703
01:50:10.001 --> 01:50:15.001
We seasoned salt plus plus and my policy was beat up.

1704
01:50:15.970 --> 01:50:18.100
Now how about the shower situation?

1705
01:50:18.101 --> 01:50:20.420
I'm not talking about getting raped and share.
I'm talking about like there,

1706
01:50:20.430 --> 01:50:24.160
there's no doors on the stalls and that show and it seems like you had to go

1707
01:50:24.161 --> 01:50:26.740
shower at like five in the morning so that people will fuck with you.

1708
01:50:26.741 --> 01:50:30.770
Was it like that,
you know,
they wouldn't ripen them or nothing like that.
You,

1709
01:50:30.771 --> 01:50:34.310
you saw,
you saw girls taking showers together,
but it wasn't nothing.
He,
they,

1710
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:39.030
they'll,
what they did,
but they left you alone.
Were you locked up a year?
I,
uh,

1711
01:50:39.031 --> 01:50:43.780
I will go in that bitch with my uniform on my dirty uniform and washed up on

1712
01:50:43.781 --> 01:50:47.910
here and my vagina and then go to my room.
Put on my dress shit.
Oh really?

1713
01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:51.760
I was just not comfortable because they used to have this thing where when you,

1714
01:50:51.761 --> 01:50:55.150
when you a newt,
when you come in to jail,
he'd be like,
trucks up,
trucks up.

1715
01:50:55.180 --> 01:50:57.280
That mean you look good and somebody was going to eat yo.

1716
01:50:57.610 --> 01:51:00.190
So every time a new load of cheese come up,

1717
01:51:00.191 --> 01:51:03.850
trucks up and they'd be upstairs picking them up down that one,
that one,

1718
01:51:03.851 --> 01:51:08.851
that slang to start using works up trucks up pretty ladies walked by trucks.

1719
01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:13.900
Yeah,
they would,
they would yell at trucks up.

1720
01:51:14.630 --> 01:51:18.300
So how did you avoid getting wifed up?
Like it's not,
it's not,

1721
01:51:18.550 --> 01:51:20.980
that's what it seems like it happens in women.
I wasn't gay.

1722
01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:23.760
I wasn't getting you was not sucking on my hands.
And you know,

1723
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:28.300
I had a real ghetto baby daddy day.
We'll make you call on Jesus.

1724
01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:32.410
He couldn't read,
but he can fuck.
I ain't gone lie.
He couldn't read a leak.

1725
01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:33.850
Y'All were getting lost.
Got One.

1726
01:51:33.851 --> 01:51:37.510
No gps begging them days and he couldn't read the street signs,
but he could,

1727
01:51:37.570 --> 01:51:41.620
he could.
He could make love.
There you go.
Yeah,
he sucked his thumb too,
but

1728
01:51:50.430 --> 01:51:52.480
it was like a,
I don't know,

1729
01:51:52.481 --> 01:51:56.870
he's still sucking to Nep rollerskating.
He'd be rolling scale.

1730
01:51:57.240 --> 01:51:58.600
He's a fucking gay.

1731
01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:08.200
Your Daddy?
Yeah,
he's so gay.

1732
01:52:08.230 --> 01:52:10.330
He said pump arms on his roller skates.

1733
01:52:11.450 --> 01:52:16.330
Pompom with the little bell
ringing bell.

1734
01:52:16.510 --> 01:52:20.410
They get more young girls.
Well he loved this guy.
He suck his thumb.
Oh my God,

1735
01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:22.540
it was dom is a boxer rock.

1736
01:52:22.570 --> 01:52:27.100
I remember when we got locked up one time when shooting craps and I jumped the

1737
01:52:27.101 --> 01:52:29.790
fence and he jumped the physical,
he could run his ass.

1738
01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:33.190
He could've been a track star and I got stuck on the fence and I couldn't get

1739
01:52:33.191 --> 01:52:36.250
over.
So he came to pull me down and we all got arrested.

1740
01:52:36.490 --> 01:52:39.670
And so we go to court one day after,
after I clean up my life,

1741
01:52:39.671 --> 01:52:41.230
the case came back and we had to go to court.

1742
01:52:41.470 --> 01:52:44.230
So he called me all these fat bitches and shit.
So I,
you know,

1743
01:52:44.231 --> 01:52:47.690
I wasn't even at me.
Oh,
you're fat bitch.
You showing that.
Why the judge?

1744
01:52:47.691 --> 01:52:50.150
They didn't know.
So I said,
I'm going to get this dumb motherfucker.

1745
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:52.890
I waited till it.
The lady come in,
she said,

1746
01:52:52.940 --> 01:52:53.780
Y'All going to get probation

1747
01:52:54.040 --> 01:52:57.980

1748
01:52:59.530 --> 01:53:00.363

1749
01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:05.900
<v 11>Court rule fell out laughing.
I said,

1750
01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:11.000
grabbed my keys and walked up out of there.
Nice.
He's,
you know what's crazy?

1751
01:53:11.210 --> 01:53:14.780
He is still mad.
He,
I talked to him a couple of weeks ago.
He's like,

1752
01:53:14.930 --> 01:53:17.300
I don't have no relationship with my son because of,

1753
01:53:17.390 --> 01:53:21.650
because you ran off and left me and I said,
dude,
you beat me.

1754
01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:25.010
You shot me pieces.
She gave me gonna ruin craps and fleas.

1755
01:53:25.250 --> 01:53:28.090
I supposed to keep sticking around air fryer to get punched in and left.

1756
01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:29.990
I got to grow up one day.

1757
01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:33.080
I didn't know until I don't have a relationship with my son and he won't even

1758
01:53:33.081 --> 01:53:35.480
call me.
I said,
well he going to call you.
I said,

1759
01:53:35.481 --> 01:53:39.260
but you ride the bus and every time he tried to talk to you a background is too

1760
01:53:39.261 --> 01:53:43.760
loud so you should wait till you get a call.
It's when your background is,

1761
01:53:43.820 --> 01:53:47.240
you know,
a lot more quieter so he can understand what the fuck you saying.

1762
01:53:48.050 --> 01:53:51.090
You don't want your son around a guy that's abuse of anyways.
Alright,

1763
01:53:51.140 --> 01:53:53.650
well my son not knowing,
my husband raised him and he said,

1764
01:53:53.651 --> 01:53:55.940
I try but I don't have nothing to talk to him about.

1765
01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:58.820
All my son is remember as a pair of shoes he never bought.

1766
01:53:58.970 --> 01:54:00.830
I don't even remember these shoes.
He said,

1767
01:54:00.831 --> 01:54:04.430
Dude told me going to buy me a pair of a pair of cleats for football and he

1768
01:54:04.431 --> 01:54:06.050
never bought him so,

1769
01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:09.830
but he always said I took his keys away and she lived in Atlanta.
I'm like,

1770
01:54:09.831 --> 01:54:13.190
call her,
don't worry about it.
He's just guilty.
That's what,

1771
01:54:13.191 --> 01:54:14.870
that's what crappy people do.

1772
01:54:14.970 --> 01:54:17.600
They make you feel like shit for stuff that you shouldn't feel like shit for.

1773
01:54:17.630 --> 01:54:18.160
You know what I mean?

1774
01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:21.230
Did he know somehow I'm going to sue you when his book came out,
I said,
dude,

1775
01:54:21.231 --> 01:54:25.830
you can't read.
First of all,
I'm not really much for me.
And I said,
if you do,

1776
01:54:25.850 --> 01:54:26.391
you're behind.

1777
01:54:26.391 --> 01:54:29.120
You're been on behind on your child support since I know so there you go.

1778
01:54:29.130 --> 01:54:31.700
You're going to sue me.
They're going to cut me a check right back,

1779
01:54:31.790 --> 01:54:35.420
so please sue me.
Yeah,
yeah,
no,
he's like a door and he's ain't doing,

1780
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:36.790
I'm not worried about that claim.

1781
01:54:37.420 --> 01:54:41.000
All want to pay to send you to a seminar.

1782
01:54:41.390 --> 01:54:45.160
Would you consider going to this if we,
you know we have,

1783
01:54:45.170 --> 01:54:47.840
we set up the whole thing.
Are you serious?

1784
01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:57.940
<v 3>I was just wanting to share.
There are many ways to orgasm.
What the fuck?</v>

1785
01:55:01.890 --> 01:55:03.020

1788
01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:21.580
we'll send a camera crew and you try to full weekend.

1789
01:55:24.510 --> 01:55:26.970
You learn how to come hug though.
You don't want to learn.

1790
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:33.500
<v 10>Come home.
Wait.</v>

1791
01:55:33.501 --> 01:55:36.290
Now what caliber of white people are these days?

1792
01:55:38.250 --> 01:55:42.520
Take another stupid ass white people.
Money.
Absolutely.
Black pastors

1793
01:55:44.930 --> 01:55:48.720
wants to give them money to send you to the coast.
I don't know yet,

1794
01:55:48.721 --> 01:55:51.840
but I'm willing to pay whatever it is.
You want to go to the comma.

1795
01:55:56.740 --> 01:56:01.030
When you hug people near you.
Calm.
She got a new girlfriend.
I call a big foot.

1796
01:56:01.830 --> 01:56:05.130
Big Foot.
Well you and big foot go.

1797
01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:09.150
She got a big old beast.
She begging out Brian,

1798
01:56:22.380 --> 01:56:27.030

Oh,

1799
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:33.290

We're not in a relationship.
I'm like,

1800
01:56:33.291 --> 01:56:37.490

Once you get the vagina,

1801
01:56:37.491 --> 01:56:38.360
from what I understand,

1802
01:56:38.361 --> 01:56:42.980
it moves pretty quickly to have a new one every thanksgiving.

1803
01:56:43.220 --> 01:56:45.080
And I tried to tell the new one this time.
I said,

1804
01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:48.320
if you don't make it at three Thanksgiving and you don't count,

1805
01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:51.340
we don't even lock their phones,
you know,
till they make it.
It three things get.

1806
01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:54.710
And I literally have no lesbians numbers locked in my phone.

1807
01:56:55.210 --> 01:56:59.630
She get rid of all of them.
Wow.

She's still,
you know,
figuring it out.

1809
01:57:06.140 --> 01:57:09.710
I said,
you're such a slut who is just like your real daddy.

1810
01:57:09.930 --> 01:57:11.590
You just got so many holes

1811
01:57:14.780 --> 01:57:19.490

I would like for her to use off of John and the right way.

1812
01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:22.430
You know this is part of life,

Beautiful.

1813
01:57:22.431 --> 01:57:23.510
She's doing her thing right now.

1814
01:57:25.220 --> 01:57:28.940
She needed to get married and that's why everybody's 31

1815
01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:35.480
oh happy birthday.

1817
01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:40.010
I mean it was like black people not vote.

1818
01:57:40.011 --> 01:57:42.080

1819
01:57:42.290 --> 01:57:45.680
That man did all of that shit.
That's true.

1820
01:57:45.970 --> 01:57:49.640

1821
01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:53.313

What's wrong with foot?

1827
01:58:18.050 --> 01:58:21.410
What if they were big foot?
Would that be okay?
I don't care who it is.

1828
01:58:24.270 --> 01:58:26.500

1837
01:59:06.460 --> 01:59:10.840

1838
01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:12.490

You line will show you this and then now these aren't what?

1840
01:59:17.230 --> 01:59:21.130
I'm your mom and you're my son and I followed him.

1841
01:59:22.270 --> 01:59:24.640
Are you really?
I said,
yes,
I am.
He's thinking,
you know what,

1842
01:59:25.420 --> 01:59:28.660
I was scared to let you know too.
I am too,
both consenting adults.

1843
01:59:28.690 --> 01:59:33.640
If it comes down to it,
you know,
it's just like the gate there,
you know,

1844
01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:37.130
as long as they're over 18 or what is their race?

1845
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:42.540

Not why,
but they,
they could me,
you know what I mean?

1847
01:59:45.790 --> 01:59:47.440
And their actions kind of stupid.

1848
01:59:48.430 --> 01:59:53.080
Latinas are great for making babies but not with your Mama.
And I was not good.

1849
01:59:53.900 --> 01:59:57.440
And they let,

They got arrested,

1850
01:59:58.130 --> 02:00:00.380
they went to get married.
I went to jail or they went to jail.

1851
02:00:00.590 --> 02:00:03.560
They should have went to jail.
She should've been,
should've been timeless.

1852
02:00:03.950 --> 02:00:06.980
Absolutely crazy.
That's crazy.
Deep people cry.

1853

You know the funniest thing I love telling this.

1875
02:01:38.290 --> 02:01:42.410
