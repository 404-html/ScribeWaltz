I'm so excited for today.
Um,
there's a couple of things happening.</v>

75
00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:12.310
First of all,
we have,
um,
we,

76
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.460
so we did a segment last week,
um,

77
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.640
that we that with Kyle Kinane yeah.

78
00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:22.510
So you'll see that things might look a little different cause the set changed.

79
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.240
If you're a viewer,
if you're a viewer,
you'll see changes.

80
00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:31.400
If you just listen,
you won't really obviously notice much.
Um,

81
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.460
but Kyle was fantastic.
I can't believe it had been forever since we eat.

82
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.640
<v 2>I definitely know it's so funny is that I haven't seen Kyle and the light of day</v>

83
00:05:40.641 --> 00:05:43.250
in about 15 years.
Yeah.
I've only ever seen him at night.

84
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.200
So it was when he walked in,
I didn't even recognize.

85
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.380
<v 0>Yeah.
So you'll hear stuff that we talk about with him.
Um,
that was,</v>

86
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.950
it's Kinda connected more with the Danny Brown episode,
which I don't know,

87
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.760
Gosh,
if you don't know,
if you've never,

88
00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.980
if you're kind of just watching the show and you're getting into it now,

89
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:02.900
or you're listening for the first time and you're like,

90
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.350
what episode should I point people towards to,
you know,

91
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.270
get an idea of what the show is like.
Dude,
give them the Danny Brown episodes.

92
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.130
So great.
He's the best guest I think we've ever had.

93
00:06:14.131 --> 00:06:18.950
Hands down that's almost 500 episodes with nothing but mostly comedians.

94
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.250
And he basically shits on,
I mean,
he,
that's how good he is.

95
00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.710
<v 2>He's so engaging.
And He,
and Annie's a mommy.</v>

96
00:06:25.711 --> 00:06:29.100
So they came in here and just excited.
Yeah.
So that was,
oh,

97
00:06:29.101 --> 00:06:33.090
and I have not had been and I'm ready to try a prison burrito.
Yeah.

98
00:06:33.091 --> 00:06:36.810
We got to do a prison brews.

I keep thinking about,

99
00:06:36.811 --> 00:06:40.890
write it down.

Oh,

107
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.850
you don't want to ramble way to write it down and the,

108
00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:19.080
so this Friday mine will come.
That's right.
Oh I did one with him.

109
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.320

111
00:07:25.291 --> 00:07:27.570

112
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.120

So any tried is to get under the hood with Comedians.
Yes.

117
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:44.680
Which is,

118
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.680
I think the most fascinating thing is that he sits down with all of us maniacs

119
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.840
and figures out why we're so fucked up.
Yeah,

Loving to this.

141
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.530
Go to your mom's house,

142
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:24.613
Christina.

143
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:37.403
Yeah,

144
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.400
I'm a cougar.
Wow.
Wow.

145
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:09.090
<v 2>Um,
I love you.
I miss you.
Haven't seen you all fucking week.</v>

146
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.050
Oh,
you're fucking done.
And she sounds just like my mom.

147
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:17.410
She does kind of racks and memories.
You rest in peace.
I don't know.

148
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.410
I don't know.
So angry in life.
Didn't really fucking guns.

149
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.040
This fucking bitch can't fucking fuck you.
You're a mother fucker.

150
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.800
Day One that I met with and that was how you met my mom.
You're like,

151
00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:31.190
my mom's kind of crazy.
Okay.

152
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:39.550
<v 3>She's like,
Oh,
this fucking count in Bloomingdale's.
Say this shit to him.</v>

153
00:10:39.551 --> 00:10:41.970
I said,
fuck you.
You fucking bitch.
Yeah.

154
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:47.170
<v 2>Whoa.
Yeah.
It was so crazy.
My mom,
Hey,
it was always confrontational with people.</v>

155
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.780
She was deeply racist.
Almost as racist,
as Burp,

156
00:10:49.781 --> 00:10:51.820
but that's not even really possible.
That's true.

157
00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.870
Now I should always pick fights with people.
Yeah.
In the parking lot,

158
00:10:55.871 --> 00:10:59.350
she would do something like that to this juice is not Sweden off your fucking

159
00:10:59.351 --> 00:11:02.920
pants.
Yeah.
What is that?
It's called borderline personality disorder.

160
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.490
Mitch was crazy.

161
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.900
Bitch was cray cray and it's fucked up because you know back in the 70s and

162
00:11:10.901 --> 00:11:13.780
eighties we didn't diagnose that kind of thing.
Yeah.

163
00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.680
So my whole life I was like psalms wrong with Pico and people were like,
dude,

164
00:11:17.681 --> 00:11:21.010
she's charming.
Yeah.
And then people would be like,
well,
that's just your mom.

165
00:11:21.011 --> 00:11:25.540
You know?
You know Edith just rascal pants.
Sita.
She's just an immigrant.

166
00:11:25.541 --> 00:11:26.820
You're like,
Nah,
there's some d deeper

167
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.880
<v 3>cup people say like,
Oh,
you know there's real,</v>

168
00:11:30.881 --> 00:11:33.970
a spicy spirited.
Yeah.
That's another word for crazy.

169
00:11:33.971 --> 00:11:36.910
When someone tells you your spirit is very animated personality.

170
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:43.690
Yeah.
Like bitches out of her fucking mind.
This lady that was in that clip,
man.

171
00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.630
Yeah.
The setup here is that she is,

172
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:51.370
this lady is in a convenience store.
She bought apple juice like from the,

173
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.040
you know,
from the freezer,
right?
Like from the,
from

174
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.060
<v 2>the free French.
And she's trying to,
Canada should sweet as fuck too.
She's like,</v>

175
00:11:58.061 --> 00:12:02.890
it's not sweet enough.
Super sweets.
All sugar.
She says it's expired and then,

176
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.890
well,
I'll let it unfold.
You know,
let them look at those tits.

177
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.133
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

178
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:17.960
Fires March 20th,
2014

179
00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.130
I'm sorry we can't help you.
There's no refunds.

180
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:27.250
[inaudible] call the company and complained to them,

181
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.920
but we're not replacing [inaudible]

182
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:55.260
<v 2>company.
Company,

183
00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:06.843
<v 4>Call the cops.</v>

184
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.080
<v 2>She's doing her now.
She's doing her foreigners.</v>

185
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.250
Swear this bitch just complaining about the carpet.

186
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.990
Oh,
she's not speaking to her language like curse at them and Armenian?

187
00:13:24.991 --> 00:13:27.120
I don't think so.
I think she was saying the juice is bad.

188
00:13:27.121 --> 00:13:28.110
You have no carpet here.

189
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.410
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

190
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:41.660
<v 2>I hate fat.
Fat.
So fat.</v>

191
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:44.870
She's such a fatty and she's not wearing a supportive bra,

192
00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:49.180
which is rule number one.
And when you got big sloppers,
you gotta buy the Bra,

193
00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.560
hoist them titties up.
Hey,
I know.
Yeah.

194
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.630
<v 4>Didn't you have to be cute?</v>

195
00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:06.820
<v 2>She says she hates that pigment.
And Mexicans just dropping it on,</v>

196
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.310
trusting all the real emotions come out.
One time I went,

197
00:14:11.311 --> 00:14:14.970
I went to an all,
they have Mexican,
let's try,
this is my mother.

198
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.170
I went to an all girls Catholic school.
I was in the 90s.

199
00:14:19.171 --> 00:14:23.400
I used to wear a Bandana on my hair.
I remember when my mother got,

200
00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:28.260
it was not as kind of lesbian.
I,
I want to see that look.
Really.

201
00:14:28.261 --> 00:14:30.760
I'll do it for your home Bandana.
Look.
Yeah.

202
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.310
So I,
I,

203
00:14:34.311 --> 00:14:38.640
the nun called my left a note with my parents cause I was being hitchhiker.

204
00:14:38.641 --> 00:14:41.490
You know,
you're like,
I don't like a lot lizard.
Yeah.

205
00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:44.343
Um,

206
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.690
my mom got called into school cause I was talking a lot during class and being

207
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.390
saucy and my mom sees wearing this head scarf.
She's walking down the hallway,

208
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:56.690
by the way,
it's in the classrooms full of nuns,
nuns.

209
00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:01.250
My mother walks in and she goes,
[inaudible] this fucking shit on your head.

210
00:15:01.251 --> 00:15:05.840
You look like a fucking dyke.
And I was like,
um,
yeah.

211
00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:08.930
And she ripped it off my head and the nuns were like,
oh,
okay,

212
00:15:08.931 --> 00:15:12.080
this makes sense now.
Like no one,
Christine,
as a problem child,

213
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.190
they knew they did.
Everybody know they're like,
the mom is,

214
00:15:16.191 --> 00:15:19.310
don't even call her in again.
And like after that,
I never got a no,

215
00:15:19.311 --> 00:15:23.600
like sending home to your mom.
They're like,
we get it.
You're a good kid.
She said,

216
00:15:23.601 --> 00:15:27.470
you look like a fucking dyke with this dykey thing.
And she hated lesbians.

217
00:15:27.471 --> 00:15:30.200
She was very,
she hated.
She was like,

218
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:32.570
I don't know about lesbian doing to each other.

219
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.880
Maybe they licking each other's to death.

220
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:39.610
I don't know what the women do to other woman,
very race.

221
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.470
The homophobic is that homophobia wins against one.

222
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:47.120
She stayed licking each other's to death.
She had pluralize it wrong.

223
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:51.200
She was very spirited,
spirited lady.

224
00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:53.690
You know your mom very spirited.

225
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.440
So speaking of Cray Cray,

226
00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:01.730
<v 0>yeah.
Can we talk about what we both been obsessed with?</v>

227
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:05.330
Oh yeah,
yeah.
Do you want to get into it or no?

228
00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:11.240
One socio
dirty Tom.

229
00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.720
Well let's,
let's set this up correctly.

230
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:19.910
So this is in a way a big deal.
Okay.

231
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.040
<v 2>This
exclusive.</v>

232
00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:31.890
<v 0>Well,
here's why.
Um,
as the audience knows for quite some time,</v>

233
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:36.980
you have been accusing me of being a disturbed psychotic man who,

234
00:16:40.021 --> 00:16:42.970
um,
loves blood and,
and,

235
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.790
and crime and criminals and all the crime shows are made for me,

236
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:53.360
my sick mind and a while ago I read this La Times piece,

237
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:58.590
you know about dirty John was a,

238
00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:03.090
it was like a six or seven part profile that red like a,

239
00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:07.890
like a thriller.
Like uh,
you know,
a book that you just can't put down,
right?

240
00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.970
Like a crime story basically.
I'm sorry,
I'm drinking water right now.
So,

241
00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.960
so,
uh,
I read it and it was just fascinating.

242
00:17:15.961 --> 00:17:18.450
It was so like a while ago.

243
00:17:18.451 --> 00:17:22.260
It was well researched and so well written.

244
00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:24.840
Then that guy who wrote that,

245
00:17:24.841 --> 00:17:29.300
who I wish I had his name right now started a podcast.
Yeah.
Dirt,

246
00:17:29.301 --> 00:17:33.660
the dirty John podcast.
And listening to it,
um,
about the,
you know,

247
00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:38.690
what he wrote and then they went even further and they,

248
00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:44.670
they did the,
um,
this bravo mini series.

249
00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:49.830
Um,
and this thing is exceptionally well done.

250
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:55.080
<v 3>It stars a Eric Bana and what's her name?
Uh,
Britain.</v>

251
00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:00.180
No.
Katie.
Stan,
no smaller.

252
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.980
She's Great Britain,
Britain.
And so anyways,

253
00:18:04.981 --> 00:18:06.180
to problem mini series.

254
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:10.200
So well done about the real story.

255
00:18:10.201 --> 00:18:15.201
This is a real psychopath and guests who absolutely is obsessed with it.

256
00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:22.650
Well,
if it isn't old psycho pants herself,
Christina,

257
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:26.400
I am.
I listen,
I,
you know me,

258
00:18:26.401 --> 00:18:31.050
I've been resisting the urge to jump into your shows for about 14 years forever.

259
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:34.800
I never do it.
And for some reason,
what's the appeal here?

260
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:39.500
Dirty John got me hooked.
I am.
I am deep into the darkness with you.
Yeah,

261
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:43.440
fine.
We're,
we're finally sharing the shows.
Greg,
what?
What's his last name?

262
00:18:43.441 --> 00:18:47.430
Do you know?
Oh,
oh,
sorry.
I thought you were telling me the name of the guy.

263
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.870
Anyway,
dirty John,
you got to see the show on Bravo.

264
00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:53.370
Here's why I'm riveted.
Hey,

265
00:18:53.371 --> 00:18:57.600
the guy's a total psychopath and he cons women,

266
00:18:57.601 --> 00:19:00.750
but he's not just a con artist.
He's,
he's more than that.
Right.

267
00:19:00.751 --> 00:19:04.230
When she say he's a master manipulator,
that's is a,

268
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.200
that's the name of the guy.
But if you look up,

269
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:10.300
like if you click on maybe like John Wick your pants,
isn't it?
Yeah,

270
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:11.490
that's who John Is.

271
00:19:11.491 --> 00:19:16.470
But the guy that actually wrote the article and um,

272
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:19.830
you know,
did the podcasts like Craig something?
I,
yeah,

273
00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:23.800
I know there's a podcast to where they go in depth on it.

274
00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.770
Say who that guy is.

275
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:32.430
You can't read it Christopher.
No,
I can't.
Can you make it bigger buddy?
Oh,

276
00:19:32.431 --> 00:19:36.570
Christopher.
Christopher mom.
Yes.
That's who it is offered.
Offered.
Yes.

277
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.630
That's who wrote the La Times article.
That's who started the,

278
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:41.870
the hood of this whole phenomenon.
And it is a phenomenal,

279
00:19:41.871 --> 00:19:43.020
here's what I love about it.

280
00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:47.910
So my mother remarried to a psychopath as well,
but he was,

281
00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:52.040
he was a high,
he was nicer.
Uh,
he was just a criminal.
And,
uh,

282
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.900
this guy reminds me a little bit of my Stepdad the,

283
00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:59.190
so that's the actual debate as the hook in the mouth because he reminds me a

284
00:19:59.191 --> 00:20:02.940
little bit of watching that dynamic unfold between my mother and my Stepdad.

285
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:07.620
But I'm more obsessed with Deb,
the,

286
00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.680
the woman's carrying raging to what said,

287
00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.580
I fucking hate her so much.
So fucking much.

288
00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:17.640
And I think what bothers me even more because she falls into the sheet.

289
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:19.410
So listen,
here's the story.
He gets,

290
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:24.470
he cons her or they get married within what five weeks story is that this guy is

291
00:20:24.631 --> 00:20:29.160
a,
he's a lifelong pariah.
Okay.
Targets people,

292
00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:34.230
sucks money,
life,
joy,
everything out of them.
And he does it in real life.

293
00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:35.250
And in this story,

294
00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:40.520
he does it to a a four times divorced but successful interior design.

295
00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.880
This is what really happened.
He targets her,
she's pretty,
she's smart,

296
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:45.920
she's got her shit,
her shit,

297
00:20:45.921 --> 00:20:50.740
their targets gets her hooks or Mary's or within eight weeks,

298
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.150
her adult children are like,
something's up with this fucking guy.

299
00:20:55.260 --> 00:21:00.040
Cause he wears scrubs bay.
He's not really an anesthesiologist.
They find out.

300
00:21:00.041 --> 00:21:04.030
They just kind of figure out that like this guy's full of lies and everybody

301
00:21:04.031 --> 00:21:08.100
sees it.
But mom,
so that's what I,
that's what makes it,

302
00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.640
because we can all relate to that.
Like how do you not see the,

303
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:13.120
because everyone is also had a friend who you're like,

304
00:21:13.121 --> 00:21:16.810
you're dating this fucking piece of shit.
Yeah.
And they're like,
what?

305
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.900
And you know,
cause people will see what they want to see.
Totally.

306
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.960
And this guy is just such a piece of shit and it really wraps you in though.

307
00:21:25.841 --> 00:21:29.320
And the story,
I don't want to give it away,
obviously.

308
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:34.270
I encourage you to read it.
I encourage you to listen to the podcasts.

309
00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:38.980
And like I said,
that Bravo show,
if you're just like a good show,
man,
that is,
uh,

310
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.520
that show,
we'll get you.
That's really what it is.
Now,

311
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:44.540
here's my problem with Deb and here's why I'm hooked such an ass.

312
00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:48.220
I'll tell you why.
So Deb is the woman that he gets,
right?
And by the way,

313
00:21:48.221 --> 00:21:49.500
she plays her.
Really,

314
00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:54.240
<v 2>here's why Deb infuriates me is that yeah,</v>

315
00:21:54.241 --> 00:21:59.130
she's one of these people who sew and a sense just a deer in headlights,

316
00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:03.240
big fucking doe-eyed led blind,
you know that the gentle,

317
00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:04.820
so he's got the knife man,

318
00:22:04.821 --> 00:22:09.821
he cure and she just talks that what the world is it bad place and I'm so

319
00:22:10.471 --> 00:22:13.830
fucking envious of that being that naive.
Yes.

320
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:18.640
What a really boiled for me.
It's my rage that I will,

321
00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.700
I've never had that privilege of being able to just be a dumb fuck in the world

322
00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:27.240
and be that naive and innocent.
Like everything's great.

323
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.110
And the people around Deb protector and like,
you know what I'm saying?

324
00:22:31.111 --> 00:22:33.450
Like where you just get to be a child your whole life.

325
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:38.520
And what kind of infuriates me about this too is the still whole through line.

326
00:22:38.521 --> 00:22:41.130
They're like,
you're a victim.
Dab.
You're just a victim.
No,

327
00:22:41.131 --> 00:22:42.810
you didn't do anything wrong.
You're a victim.
And it's like,

328
00:22:42.811 --> 00:22:46.800
well there are so many flags with him.
And yes.
Okay.
The first time around.

329
00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:50.400
Remember she,
she does leave him at one point when she finds everything out,

330
00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:55.410
but then she goes back and then go,
bitch,
you're not a victim.

331
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.340
Like are you still,

332
00:22:56.341 --> 00:23:00.300
do we still get to consider you a fucking victim if you know everything before

333
00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:01.410
you keep going back

334
00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:02.080
<v 3>is like,</v>

335
00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:06.070
there's one thing where you're so naive that you're oblivious and unaware,

336
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:11.310
but when they start telling her and she understands that this guy is really good

337
00:23:11.551 --> 00:23:15.490
that's laid out.
Yeah.
She's like,
yeah,
I know I'm dumb.

338
00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:20.800
Oh,
it's,
yeah,
it's,
it's infuriating.
And she puts her children in danger.

339
00:23:20.801 --> 00:23:25.100
That's also infuriating.
That may stop putting your fan and danger.
Yeah.

340
00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:30.570
And I mean these lot lizards that I give them all the wrong information.

341
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:36.520
We talk about lot lizards.
I've been fascinated with this idea like,

342
00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:40.270
so tell me about their life.
Like what,
so because I'm on a,

343
00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:45.780
I'm the tour bus champ.
I take my bus across the country.
Um,

344
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:50.390
<v 0>yeah,
I think the bang bus across the country.
Um,
and,
uh,</v>

345
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.950
I've worked with a couple of drivers and they're really nice guys and,

346
00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.410
but they have this life where,
you know,
they literally,

347
00:23:57.411 --> 00:24:02.270
these do drive like a trucker would across the nation and he kind of,

348
00:24:02.271 --> 00:24:06.980
you know,
it's a very specific type of living where they just get,
you know,

349
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:09.960
they get used to weird hours and weird living.
You don't,

350
00:24:09.961 --> 00:24:12.690
you're not driving truck drivers.
Yeah.
Do they,

351
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:18.050
I mean the tour bus drivers have a little bit different than the truck drivers

352
00:24:18.051 --> 00:24:21.790
will have.
A lot of times a cabin they can sleep in there,
in,

353
00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:24.200
in the bus driving world and tour buses.

354
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:27.740
Some drivers will sleep in the bunks,
you know,

355
00:24:27.741 --> 00:24:31.370
if it's like an arrangement in the master suite and he's not sleeping in the

356
00:24:31.371 --> 00:24:35.330
bunk.
No,
no,
I get them hotel rooms.
Oh,
but I mean,
when you're not in the bus,

357
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:40.250
he sleeps in your bed.
You of course,
of course get grossed out by that.
And then,

358
00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:45.950
no,
we don't.
No one shits on the,
on the bus.
He didn't keep brown bags.
It maybe,

359
00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.270
but bags.
Is that what we,
basically,
we just,
you know,

360
00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:53.390
we piss in each other's mouths and then we put it in the toilet.
No,
but so,

361
00:24:53.391 --> 00:24:53.951
you know,
the,

362
00:24:53.951 --> 00:24:58.700
this like really like kind of a traveler's life for real,

363
00:24:58.730 --> 00:24:59.180
you know,

364
00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:03.440
so you start asking him questions about sleep and cause I'm fascinated by that.

365
00:25:03.441 --> 00:25:07.040
I'm like,
so when do you sleep?
Cause he'll drive us through the night,
you know?

366
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:09.470
And then we arrived somewhere and I'll get up,
I'm like,
Ooh,

367
00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:12.230
I'm going to go get coffee.
He's like,
he's like,
Yep.
I'm like,
wait,

368
00:25:12.231 --> 00:25:16.670
when do you sleep?
He's like,
I'll sleep this afternoon,
you know,
this afternoon.

369
00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:19.640
I wish I was one of those people too.
I don't need to sleep.
Yeah.

370
00:25:19.641 --> 00:25:23.300
And he'll sleep six,
seven,
eight hours,
but it'll be,
you know,

371
00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:27.410
it'll be arriving to a,
it'll arrive,

372
00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:32.270
we'll arrive somewhere and he'll sleep until like the show is over,

373
00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:37.280
you know.
Okay.
So that's when he'd be I,
yeah,
but anyways,
we ask them about,
oh,

374
00:25:37.281 --> 00:25:38.810
he told us.
So he told us who,
um,

375
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:44.150
so one day we got to the Pittsburgh venue and the Pittsburgh venue,
um,

376
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:48.740
Carnegie Music Hall in Pittsburgh,
Super Old,
beautiful venue.

377
00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:50.660
So old.

378
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:54.530
It's one of the only theaters that I've been to that doesn't have showers.

379
00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:58.490
So I was like,
ah,
fuck,
because it's nice to get there.

380
00:25:58.491 --> 00:26:01.100
You take your shower before the show.
So I was like,

381
00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:04.520
I guess I'm have to use the bus showers.
Well,
the,
uh,

382
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:07.280
the bus shower,
the water,

383
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:12.310
because we're in the northeast was just so cold that it took like an hour to eat

384
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:18.290
and I was like,
it took too long.
So basically it's the first show in,

385
00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:22.230
I don't know how long,
15 years that I haven't taken a shower before the show.

386
00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:25.610
How stinky when you're nuts.
Pretty Stinky,
I guess my showered later,

387
00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:32.060
of course all gaming,
but yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

388
00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:35.540
But anyways,
then we start asking what we're,
um,
so he told us,
he goes,

389
00:26:35.541 --> 00:26:38.780
you know where the best showers are?
And then I was like,
where he goes,

390
00:26:38.781 --> 00:26:42.410
truck stops.
And I was like,
what else?
He goes,
you have no idea.

391
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.490
They're like super

392
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:46.080
<v 3>high,
like high pressure.</v>

393
00:26:46.081 --> 00:26:50.400
He's like nicer showers and you find him like five star hotel and I was like,

394
00:26:50.401 --> 00:26:53.580
you gotta be shitting me.
He's like,
yeah.
And I go,
how much are they?
10 Bucks.

395
00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:58.830
And I was like,
I want to take a truck stop shower too,
you know I want to get it.

396
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:02.820
Or you run the risk of getting stabbed.
You get,

397
00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:07.470
you also wrote rafters and you also could like meet a cool guy.
Cool.
A lot less.

398
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:08.363
Yeah.

399
00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:13.410
Well then the truck stop shower conversation led to what else happens at truck

400
00:27:13.411 --> 00:27:16.630
stops.
I was like,
Hey,
do you,

401
00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:19.930
are there really that he's like lot lizards.
And I go,

402
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:26.370
I like the phrase lot Liz lot lizard.
He was like,
Oh yeah,
they're there.
I go,

403
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:29.430
what happened to,
cause they knock on your door,
they knock on your door.

404
00:27:29.431 --> 00:27:31.200
They'll just come up,
sneak through the,

405
00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.920
and then you know they ask you if you want some.
And I go,
are they everywhere?

406
00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:42.850
He goes,
not everywhere.
He's like California.
Sure has a few nice weather.

407
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.490
Sometimes it's a different arrangement.
Sometimes he said like,

408
00:27:47.491 --> 00:27:49.080
you'll go like the driver.

409
00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:53.070
Well like obviously like knows someone in the area.

410
00:27:53.071 --> 00:27:57.750
You'll see like cars pulling in that they're clearly,
it's been a range,

411
00:27:57.751 --> 00:28:02.730
like maybe beforehand.
Yeah.
Like the guy knows that this girl works in this area,

412
00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:07.450
so lizard will show up and then uh,
have,
I was like,
oh,
what's that?
Like?

413
00:28:07.451 --> 00:28:12.270
He's like,
I don't know about,
he doesn't know.
I'm like,

414
00:28:12.271 --> 00:28:16.050
you
know about these lot lizards.

415
00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:21.490
So innocent and you a dummy.
Yeah.
I wouldn't be in a lot lizard.

416
00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:26.730
What I would like,
I mean,
I think a fun fantasy would be like a stranded girl,

417
00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:31.220
you know?
It was like,
no,
I don't have any way to get,

418
00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:39.480
get
dirty Dallas.
I'm stuck here.
I'm like,

419
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:43.980
Oh,
I'm going to Dallas.
Yeah,
come on over.

420
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:47.400
And then she gets on the bus.
I'm like,
no,
you got to pay the toll.
You know?

421
00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:51.670
And then like what you do is he's really encouraging.

422
00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:57.360
You're just wear out and you know,
what do you mean bang?

423
00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:00.060
You know,
and the bang bus.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

424
00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.720
Well you told me you guys take your turns on the,
that's what I'm saying.
Well,

425
00:29:03.721 --> 00:29:08.440
I'm saying with this stranded girl is like,
she gets the business from me.

426
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.470
I give it to me,
I gave it to the opening act.
He runs through her.

427
00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:18.150
Then the driver takes his turn and then we drop her off.
Nowhere close to that.

428
00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:25.400
Wow.
I'm like Montana.
Good luck.
Yeah,

429
00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:29.430
you shouldn't hitchhike.
You stupid bitch.
There wasn't going to go that far.

430
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:31.770
Well it's a lesson to learn.
That was a good lesson.

431
00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:35.560
But you guys didn't tell me about a thing called hot bagging.
Yeah.

432
00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:41.940
Well you can't make chocolate on the bus because can I guess on like

433
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.170
<v 0>the really state of the art?
Um,
you're,</v>

434
00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:50.340
you're telling me like Brian Regan's bus.
Yeah,
you can shit on his shit.

435
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:54.260
On his boat.
He had a custom designed and right.
And then,

436
00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:59.660
so his bus has like the special grinder and there's like coffee beans.

437
00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:01.690
I swear.
He told me,
he goes,

438
00:30:01.691 --> 00:30:03.860
what's the point of buying your own bus if you can't shit on it?

439
00:30:03.861 --> 00:30:07.540
And he's kind of really good point.
I was like,
yeah,
of course.
But most of them,

440
00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:11.860
most of them.
Here's the thing,
you can shit,
obviously it's a toilet can you can,

441
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.650
and in the end,
you know,
they'll tell you and you know,
if it's an emergency,

442
00:30:14.651 --> 00:30:18.130
obviously don't think twice,
but some of them they're like,
you know,

443
00:30:18.131 --> 00:30:19.660
there's just the ventilation of it.

444
00:30:19.661 --> 00:30:24.430
All the shit is sitting on the bus with you and they're like,
it'll,
you know,

445
00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:28.390
I haven't done it.
But they'll say,
they say it'll find its way into the events,

446
00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:33.040
you know,
until they clean it out.
So yeah,
the hot bag,
you just,
you know,

447
00:30:33.041 --> 00:30:36.580
you grab a bag from target or something and you just put that in there and then

448
00:30:36.581 --> 00:30:37.960
you just get into that,

449
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.720
tie it up and then you can just leave it on the front seat.
You know,

450
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:45.790
a lot lizard,
a lot lizard is your payment.
Yeah.

451
00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:52.660
Right.
Yeah.
Um,
I should into a wag bag.

452
00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:57.040
I'm in Afghanistan.
Yeah.
That's how they do when you throw it into the fire

453
00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.760
hot bag.
I had a member in Afghanistan,

454
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:05.980
a lot of people have been reaching out to us online and,
and elsewhere about,

455
00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:09.160
you know,
the big news about Morton's.
Oh,
I don't,

456
00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:13.540
pulling out getting their money back and like,
you know,

457
00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:18.730
what are our steak house options essentially.
So,
uh,

458
00:31:18.731 --> 00:31:22.360
we got a number of messages about it.
Um,
I can read you a few.

459
00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:25.690
I'd like to hear it.
Go ahead.
Okay.
It says hello mothers.

460
00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:29.020
I am the future CEO of outback steakhouse.

461
00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:33.190
How do you know that there's this real,

462
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.370
and while I've never set foot in an outback steakhouse,

463
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:42.250
I plan on taking the business into my hands.
I have applied online to be the CEO.

464
00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:46.030
God Damn,
I don't think he says he has no experience,

465
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.780
but he's confident in the next few weeks he'll get the call and as soon as he

466
00:31:49.781 --> 00:31:53.860
gets the call he assigned,
he's prepared to give us $1 million check.

467
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:54.730
And on top of that,

468
00:31:55.150 --> 00:32:00.150
all out backhoe locations will indeed give you 5% off your entire appetizer.

469
00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:04.450
Even the Bloomin' onion.
Yes.
Ciao Kai.
Thanks Kai.

470
00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:08.370
I really hope they hire USC CEO without any experience.

471
00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:11.650
Well that one is obviously a joke,
honestly,
if this gets any better.

472
00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:15.490
Um,
my name is nick.

473
00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:20.230
I work for the marketing division of Texas roadhouse.
Hey,
that sounds good.

474
00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:24.250
I was forwarded your email.
Uh,
we are a fine dining establishment,

475
00:32:24.251 --> 00:32:27.220
are very active in our increasing brand awareness.

476
00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:28.960
We were informed that your podcast,

477
00:32:28.961 --> 00:32:31.420
which is a very select and unique market and to be honest,

478
00:32:31.421 --> 00:32:35.200
that's exactly what we're looking for.
That's promising.
Great.
We need partners,

479
00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.800
partners that know how to reach the people we don't always connect with,

480
00:32:38.801 --> 00:32:39.080
you know,

481
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.350
the sort of people that aren't exactly watching CNN every day and reading the

482
00:32:42.351 --> 00:32:43.480
morning newspaper.
Okay.

483
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:48.560
Below is a very specific description of our ideal target customer that we hope

484
00:32:48.561 --> 00:32:52.490
to reach through new sponsorships.
A likes fine food,

485
00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:57.050
including wet and dry age steak.
That's perfect.
Check.

486
00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:01.220
Enjoys a good time with friends and a relaxing environment.
Check.
Okay.

487
00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:06.110
Farts belches in public with no remorse.
Okay.
This doesn't seem real anymore.

488
00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:11.180
Possible suspect in active murder investigations.
Okay,
cool.

489
00:33:11.181 --> 00:33:15.740
Guy Likes big sloppy knockers.
Yeah.

490
00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:17.450
Not Bert.
Not.

491
00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:21.620
If you think this sounds like any level of your loyal listeners and we encourage

492
00:33:21.621 --> 00:33:25.910
you to reach out.
Uh,
we look forward to having you far in any of our restaurant.

493
00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:30.800
Oh,
wait a minute.
And this is sign big Dick.
Nick.
Jeez.
All right.

494
00:33:30.801 --> 00:33:35.510
So,
so far we have zero legitimate inquiries.
Um,

495
00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:39.380
okay.
This one says a steakhouse in Korea town.

496
00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:42.800
I love Korea town.
They have great meat there.
They own,

497
00:33:42.801 --> 00:33:45.710
I own and run a beautiful steak house in Korea town.
Uh,

498
00:33:45.711 --> 00:33:47.450
I would love to sponsor your podcasts.

499
00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.030
All that we ask is you changed the name of the podcast,

500
00:33:50.031 --> 00:33:52.040
the purpose of the show and everyone,
it appears in it.

501
00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:56.480
If you're willing to try it out,
we'll donate $100 for every million viewers

502
00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:03.050
through the goggles for gangsters foundation.
I mean,
this is just,

503
00:34:03.051 --> 00:34:07.160
this is pathetic.
Such a bummer.
And the last one,
hey,

504
00:34:07.161 --> 00:34:11.180
I worked at a steakhouse called cons.
I like the for three years Chinese.

505
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:14.180
So no problems with content,
but they are cheap as fuck.

506
00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:18.110
Hit me back with some figures who I can take this further to try it out.

507
00:34:18.111 --> 00:34:20.620
We've got Sushi and Hibachi.
Thanks.

508
00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:24.500
Eli doesn't look like we have any sponsors.
Nope,
that's it.

509
00:34:24.501 --> 00:34:28.040
I guess we're steakhouse sponsor free right now and we,
we're still free agents.

510
00:34:28.041 --> 00:34:29.090
So if you know anybody,

511
00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:34.710
your mom's podcast@gmail.com and make sure you throw the steak house in the

512
00:34:35.571 --> 00:34:40.280
subject line.
And I do love your burbs.
Thank you.
They make me laugh every time.

513
00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.580
Yeah.
Or you've been following,
by the way,
this a Jessie Smollett

514
00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:48.800
<v 2>sorry.
Have,
I mean I've heard about it.
I saw first I saw on it,
you know,</v>

515
00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:52.770
I do love the gram.
I saw the outpouring of I,

516
00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:56.170
my favorite thing in the world is when people hop on board,

517
00:34:56.171 --> 00:35:00.200
any of the social justice things like very quickly there's a shooting there,

518
00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:03.340
the first person to supply and with all of you

519
00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:09.640
fucking idiots.
Yeah.
Who gives a shit about your fucking die.

520
00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:12.210
Put up a photo of a ribbon when that happens.

521
00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:19.110
Thank you.
Fucking,
who cares?
Why are you doing that or no?

522
00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:22.330
It helps him.
Nobody's ones,
right.
Those are my favorite.

523
00:35:22.331 --> 00:35:25.690
And they do a picture of their,
like,
this is my partner.

524
00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:30.790
I love her so much.
Do you love your partner?

525
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:34.300
I know cause I'm Tom his arm and I don't,

526
00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:36.940
and we don't do that because like I just,

527
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:41.100
it's so fucking cheesy to be like the light of my life.

528
00:35:41.101 --> 00:35:45.960
This is the one and only you're the inspiration and it's so sincere and earnest

529
00:35:45.961 --> 00:35:49.990
like us.
I'm just embarrassed by it.
You're fucking queer,
you know?

530
00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:56.100
It's just,
it's embarrassing.
I don't,
I don't like it.

531
00:35:56.101 --> 00:35:58.350
It's more embarrassing when it's like a known person.

532
00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:02.280
I know you're a regular person who's like,
here's the love of my life,
whatever.

533
00:36:02.281 --> 00:36:05.490
It's different.
But like when the person with like celebrities do it,

534
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:10.530
followers is like,
yeah,
here's my lover.
Yeah.
Do Love them.
Look,

535
00:36:10.531 --> 00:36:14.220
there's a picture showing how much I love them.
I think that's what I'm saying.

536
00:36:14.221 --> 00:36:16.920
I don't think regular,
like everyday people,
that's normal.

537
00:36:16.921 --> 00:36:20.400
But when you're a celebrity and you're like,
look at my spouse,

538
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:23.880
look how wonderful my life is.
Like bitch,
we get at your life and a,

539
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:26.820
I met Bastille Day.

540
00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.450
Like I don't think he ever forgot that you out of raspberries.

541
00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:35.580
Hate it.
Yeah.
Cause you and I obviously love each other,

542
00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.950
but just like the gays,

543
00:36:37.951 --> 00:36:41.970
the public display of it would make me vomit all over myself.
Weird.
Yeah.

544
00:36:41.971 --> 00:36:45.000
So any who I was on the gram and I saw the outpouring.

545
00:36:45.001 --> 00:36:48.480
That's how I know anything happens in the world as people on Instagram reporting

546
00:36:48.481 --> 00:36:52.100
it.
Yeah.
And so Jesse smaller,
that's how you say he's an

547
00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:57.420
<v 0>or,
I mean this story is now enormous,
but so what happened was a few weeks ago,</v>

548
00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:02.250
he's an actor on empire,
right.
And uh,
he show's been on for a minute.
Yeah.
Yeah.

549
00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:05.230
It's a wildly successful show.
He,

550
00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:10.240
he's on the show news story came out that this dude was attacked at like two in

551
00:37:12.901 --> 00:37:16.530
the morning,
allegedly,
allegedly attacked at like two in the morning.

552
00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:20.910
Somebody put a noose around his neck,
beat them,
poured bleach on,

553
00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:26.660
said racial homophobic slurs and then was like this Maggie country bitch.

554
00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.380
Like,
so like an intense,
yeah,
the hate crime.
Right.
So everybody was like,

555
00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:35.850
what the fuck?
But then like as the story developed,

556
00:37:35.851 --> 00:37:40.260
it started to have peculiar details.
You know,

557
00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:44.970
the whole thing is yeah,
it's just,
it's really disturbing and sad.

558
00:37:44.971 --> 00:37:48.470
But so ends up with what we're at right now at least as the,

559
00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.570
at the moment of recording this because this story will probably develop more

560
00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:55.830
between now and when people even see or hear this,
you know,

561
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:57.480
but as of right now,

562
00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:02.600
well we know for sure is that um,
like a,

563
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.860
a month or a few months ago,
he did receive a letter,

564
00:38:07.861 --> 00:38:12.861
a threatening letter at the production offices and that he was resentful that

565
00:38:14.311 --> 00:38:19.290
the letter and the threat didn't receive more attention.
Right.

566
00:38:19.291 --> 00:38:24.291
It was like a homophobic racial letter cause he is openly gay and I guess it

567
00:38:24.811 --> 00:38:25.860
probably is one of those things.

568
00:38:25.861 --> 00:38:30.630
It was like a blurb maybe and then people didn't really talk about it much.

569
00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:32.190
Well that upset him.
Hmm.

570
00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:37.490
So what's allegedly happening right now is that when that,

571
00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:40.810
when the attack happened,
you know,

572
00:38:40.811 --> 00:38:42.730
obviously people are like we need to find the suspects.

573
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:48.750
They researched and all the cameras in the area and they did find two guys

574
00:38:49.151 --> 00:38:52.030
walking around at that time.
So like these are the people of interest.

575
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:55.480
So then they eventually,
uh,

576
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:58.330
apprehended and arrested the people of interest.

577
00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:03.710
It turns out there to Nigerian American brothers who go work out at the same gym

578
00:39:05.591 --> 00:39:10.360
as him.
One of them has even appeared on an episode of empire extra number one.

579
00:39:10.361 --> 00:39:13.090
Yeah.
And you know,
when the police were like,

580
00:39:13.091 --> 00:39:15.820
we want to see your phone records because apparently he was on the phone with

581
00:39:15.821 --> 00:39:18.070
his manager at the time of the attack.

582
00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:23.140
He gave them a redacted version of his phone records word.
Um,

583
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:27.460
so things that started to kind of,
you know,
not really add up.
And then when they,

584
00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:30.310
they spoke to those brothers,
uh,

585
00:39:30.311 --> 00:39:35.311
they released them without charges and the investigation has shifted into

586
00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:38.110
allegedly he,

587
00:39:38.111 --> 00:39:43.111
Jesse perhaps having set up this attack as a ploy for the attention.

588
00:39:44.921 --> 00:39:46.390
He felt like he deserved from the letter.

589
00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:50.150
<v 3>Interesting.
Which is highly disturbing,
highly disturbing.
And,
and,</v>

590
00:39:50.151 --> 00:39:52.720
and he did interviews.
Oh my God.

591
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.860
And he's like crying talking about what was said to him.
Like,
yeah.
Yeah.

592
00:39:58.861 --> 00:40:01.980
Really.
He's an actor though.
He's an excellent,
it makes sense.
He was,

593
00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:06.090
he was really a mother fucker ass crazy dude.
Well.
Okay,

594
00:40:06.091 --> 00:40:10.410
mistake number one obviously is don't hire people.
You know,

595
00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:14.520
like the guy at the gym,
you got to put an ad out,
you got to say,
piss on me,

596
00:40:14.521 --> 00:40:18.600
beat me,
or you dude at the whole thing is a bad idea.

597
00:40:18.601 --> 00:40:20.270
It's going to blow up in the terrible,

598
00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:21.101
<v 0>bad idea.</v>

599
00:40:21.101 --> 00:40:26.101
I mean also that you should see that these dudes that he hired to attack him.

600
00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:31.690
Yeah.
I mean if these guys are allegedly attire,
if they actually attacked him,

601
00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.060
he would fucking still be an ICU.

602
00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:38.540
<v 3>Oh really?
It's our Jack.
Really.
He must have been like,
look man,</v>

603
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:43.480
I mean easy take it easy.
Like these guys are,
well,

604
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:45.740
you think even from a casting perspective,

605
00:40:45.741 --> 00:40:50.741
you may want to cast like white big guys to do the hate crime as well.

606
00:40:51.801 --> 00:40:54.850
Do it right.
You got two black eyes,
black you black motherfucker.
We're like,

607
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:59.120
wait a minute.
Yeah,
it didn't make sense.
Uh,

608
00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:01.010
I heard a rumor that he was,
they,

609
00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:05.240
he was getting fired from empire and he was doing this as a way to get
attention.

610
00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:08.630
That,
I don't know.
I don't know.
It could be true,
but who knows?

611
00:41:08.631 --> 00:41:12.950
Who knows what's at the root of this?
But that's crazy.
I mean,
it's also like,

612
00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:18.050
it really is sad.
It's sad to,
somebody would orchestrate a fake thing like this.

613
00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:18.561
Well,

614
00:41:18.561 --> 00:41:23.561
and especially like actually get hurt in illicit sympathy from people that do

615
00:41:28.101 --> 00:41:32.180
that to people dirty John Ash,
right.
Then like you go obviously like he's,

616
00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.340
you know,
he is,

617
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:38.510
<v 0>let's say a anti,
uh,
Trump,
right,
right.</v>

618
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:42.700
But this actually makes you look worse because then you're,

619
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.540
you're creating this fake narrative of something like a,
of somebody who like a,

620
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:50.180
a Trump guy doing that to you,
but they didn't do that.

621
00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:53.380
<v 2>He's making it political.
Yeah.
But you know,
by the way,</v>

622
00:41:53.381 --> 00:41:54.820
if you do make it political,

623
00:41:54.821 --> 00:41:57.880
you make it about anti Trump that you've rallied now the support of the

624
00:41:57.881 --> 00:42:01.360
entertainment industry because everybody fucking hates Trump.
And

625
00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:06.460
<v 0>well,
what ends up happening is that now,
since he made that shit up,</v>

626
00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:09.520
then like a Trump supporter gets to go like,
oh,

627
00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:13.180
this look what they're trying to paint me.
Sure.
Right.
This,
it's like it,

628
00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:15.850
the whole thing backfires on him.
It's a,
it's a really,

629
00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:18.970
obviously it's a super calculated,

630
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:22.930
poorly executed idea.
And if he wanted to do something like that,

631
00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:24.430
should have talked to me first.
Man,

632
00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:30.910
what would you have done differently?
I Dunno.
Um,

633
00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:35.920
I probably wouldn't have done this.
Yeah.
Uh,
you mean like,
hey man,

634
00:42:35.921 --> 00:42:39.670
we're going to have work out this fake hate crime.
Like,
so bizarre.

635
00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:43.420
Now Bert would be a good guy to talk to.
He knows all about hate crimes.

636
00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:46.150
I think we'll have him in soon and maybe we can run it by him.

637
00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:50.970
I bet you he'll be like,
oh,
here's how you do this.
Oh,
good.
Good drunk.

638
00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:52.780
First of all,
you got to get alcohol.

639
00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:55.230
You don't feel so bad where you say all those words.

640
00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:01.360
<v 2>Speaking of a retarded,
I'm sorry.</v>

641
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:06.420
I said I'm sorry.
Oh God.
What's going to happen?

642
00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:16.130
Uh,

643
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:20.640
I apologize for any mentally challenge listeners that are funded by that.

644
00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:25.710
Um,
did you hear that Karl Lagerfeld died?
Yeah.
The head.
Yeah.

645
00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:30.180
Yup.
I sure did.
So I,
he was the head of Chanel White House of Chanel.

646
00:43:30.181 --> 00:43:33.420
I don't know why he was.
Yeah.
So you know he's a designer,
he's very,

647
00:43:33.421 --> 00:43:35.280
very famous fashion guy.

648
00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:40.580
But what I love about him is I love anybody that has the audacity to have such a

649
00:43:41.881 --> 00:43:44.710
stylized look.
Cause if you look at those teeth,

650
00:43:44.711 --> 00:43:48.600
he is though that dude look like a bond villain for 50 years.
I know.

651
00:43:48.601 --> 00:43:53.190
And all the every day to buy them all every day because all the obituaries when

652
00:43:53.191 --> 00:43:54.120
I re read them,

653
00:43:54.121 --> 00:43:58.320
they all say he is known for his ponytail and black sunglasses.

654
00:43:58.321 --> 00:44:01.620
Like that is such a bold choice.
That collar though.
I remember that.

655
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:05.280
And fingerless gloves,

656
00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:10.550
like who just walks around life wearing shades and fingerless leather gloves and

657
00:44:11.071 --> 00:44:14.850
a ponytail and also it's not a timeless look.

658
00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:21.690
Let's do wore this everyday for decades.
Right.
And it's not a timeless look.
No,

659
00:44:21.691 --> 00:44:25.100
it's extremely eighties when he say,
I would also say it looks

660
00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.440
<v 0>like,
you know,
you see Accenture,
especially in New York,</v>

661
00:44:27.441 --> 00:44:32.190
you'll see [inaudible] eccentric,
older people walking around if this asshole.

662
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:34.560
<v 3>Yeah.
Who's basically they're wearing,
yeah,</v>

663
00:44:34.561 --> 00:44:38.370
they're hot gear from the eighties or seventies and you're like,
yeah,

664
00:44:38.371 --> 00:44:42.120
you got an update.
That shit man.
It's been four years.
You can't do that.
Wait,

665
00:44:42.121 --> 00:44:45.790
did you see as Trumpers?
Yeah.
By the way,
can go back to his tea fees.

666
00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:50.400
I mean he had enough money to take care of me.
I spelled correctly.
No,
it's wrong.

667
00:44:50.401 --> 00:44:53.730
It's Lagerfeld.
It's Lagerfeld.
Yeah.
I Dunno.
Maybe.

668
00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:57.030
Maybe it was longer and Feld getting l a.

669
00:44:57.031 --> 00:45:01.770
G.
E.
R.
F.
E.
L.
D I thought.
Oh Age.
Oh yeah.

670
00:45:01.771 --> 00:45:05.340
There's way more Lagerfeld look at that shit.

671
00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:11.070
Look at that fucking guy to be that confident and self.

672
00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:14.780
I don't know.
Is he though?
That's really an identity.
Dollar.

673
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:15.930
Here's the thing though.

674
00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:20.130
I mean you're talking about like cut your like you couldn't wear that fucking

675
00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:23.220
anywhere man.
People be like,
there's a crazy guy.
Yeah.
Yeah.

676
00:45:23.221 --> 00:45:26.520
I mean like he gets away with it cause he's the designer.
Yeah.

677
00:45:26.521 --> 00:45:30.000
You expect the designer to be.
But like,
I don't know.

678
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:32.520
And do you think at some point if I walked around I was like,
hey,

679
00:45:32.521 --> 00:45:36.630
check out my tux.
Do you like it?
It'd be like,
you look like an asshole man.

680
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:41.070
I mean,
he's so fucking old toddler look at the collar.
But Tommy,

681
00:45:41.071 --> 00:45:43.080
do you think the pony tail was real hair?

682
00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:47.230
Cause he's old as she is 85 when he died,
probably was for a for a minute and no.

683
00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:51.800
Yeah,
like a hair extension.
Oh Man.
Yeah.
Well he died.
What did he die of?
Just,

684
00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.010
I don't know.
He said that collar finally choking out.

685
00:45:56.730 --> 00:46:00.960
It's so ridiculous.
Ridiculous.
Well,
there's all these highly stylized people.

686
00:46:00.961 --> 00:46:04.380
There's like Anna Wintour.
Like she's another one.
She's known for her,
Bob.

687
00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:06.480
And then there's a Irish,

688

What are you saying?
Yeah,</v>

690
00:46:13.681 --> 00:46:15.960
there's Anna Wintour.
She's known for this Bob Wright,

691
00:46:15.961 --> 00:46:20.640
the bangs and the shit glasses.
But at least I feel like Anna Wintour could,

692
00:46:20.641 --> 00:46:24.150
um,
you know,
somebody could dress like that.
Yeah.

693
00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:27.900
I mean it's high fashion,
but you'd be like,
Oh yeah,
it's a fashionable late.

694
00:46:27.901 --> 00:46:31.470
That guy,
no one could get away.
Nobody but him,
you know,
let me look.

695
00:46:31.471 --> 00:46:35.400
She just looks like she's great.
She's like,
she's wealthy and knows fashion,

696
00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:40.470
but type in Iris App app full I r.
I.
S.
A.
P.
F.
E.
L.

697
00:46:40.471 --> 00:46:44.310
You ever seen this Old Lady?
She's super famous,

698
00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:48.990
like her wacky old lady.
Yeah,
she's cute.
She's adorable girl thing.

699
00:46:48.991 --> 00:46:53.870
Like she's wearing like chunky jewelry and the crazy glasses like I'm working,

700
00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.100
but that's what I'm talking about.
Identity in New York.

701
00:46:56.101 --> 00:46:58.110
You would see this lady walking around and you'd be like,

702
00:46:58.111 --> 00:47:02.970
I saw that this craziest,
most eccentric old lady today.
You know,

703
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.720
she's,
she's been rocking that shit for decades for sure.
I don't know.

704
00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:10.260
With her it looks appealing.
Yeah.
It suits them.

705
00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:14.280
But that's the thing is that Lagerfeld looks like,
he's like,
I've got to come.

706
00:47:14.281 --> 00:47:18.030
Dungeon is how I do think he's letting you know he's got to come down.
Yeah.

707
00:47:18.031 --> 00:47:19.140
It looks like it.
Yeah.

708
00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:22.170
But how come some people can do this and some people can't.

709
00:47:22.171 --> 00:47:24.570
Like if I put all this shit on me and have people laugh,

710
00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:27.030
it's like you're at the stimulus in your essence.
Yeah.

711
00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:29.980
Like you know that it looks appropriate on her.
When you look

712
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.380
<v 0>at her,
you're like,
oh,
she,
she carries it like it,</v>

713
00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:37.780
it fits her.
Yeah.
It's because it's because she's not

714
00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:42.870
<v 2>trying to look like that.
Just is that even Lagerfeld that's like,</v>

715
00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:47.450
that's that guy.
So gay,
like he's so powerfully gay.
Yeah.

716
00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:52.940
Gayness comes out and like fingerless leather gloves and the ponytail and the

717
00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:56.320
Glacken.
What's that?
Oh,

718
00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:58.790
that's not him.
No.

719
00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:03.360
You missing look alike.
Who the fuck is that?

720
00:48:03.361 --> 00:48:04.194
Looks so good.

721
00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:05.940
<v 0>Imitator.
You know,</v>

722
00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:10.030
<v 2>it looks like a,
the guy that invented star wars,
what's his name?
George Lucas.</v>

723
00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:15.680
It's just like the gays.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
yeah.
I mean,

724
00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:20.090
I dunno those chompers.
Yeah,
Bro.
You got to fix those.

725
00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:22.880
I wonder if he was still smashing.
Of course.

726
00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:27.810
Young of core hot model guys.
Oh,
of course.

727
00:48:27.811 --> 00:48:31.610
Like last week.
Yes.
He's three,
like 19 year old guys were like,

728
00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:36.440
you said you wanted to take pictures.
It's like,

729
00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:41.360
I go,
but photos naked.
That's his game.

730
00:48:41.361 --> 00:48:43.800
He's like,
would you like to take big picture?

731
00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:50.120
Big Picture?
Cool.
Here I have a hot bag for you.

732
00:48:50.121 --> 00:48:53.730
And they're like,
Mr Lagerfeld,
please.

733
00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.020
His jam thought he's into all of that.

734
00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:57.963
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

735
00:48:58.990 --> 00:49:01.020
<v 2>Yeah,
sure.</v>

736
00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:07.060
<v 0>Uh,

737
00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:11.550
fucking core hard fucking core for sure.
Yeah.
Oh,

738
00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:14.980
I can't bring up the next hard fucking core guy.
Yeah,

739
00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:17.950
we got some hardcore guys coming.
Yeah,

740
00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:22.690
we got Kyle Kinane.
We got Greg Fitzsimmons.

741
00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:27.700
It's going to be a good time.
I was a very good job.

742
00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:31.040
Thanks.
Let's just read an email before we take our break here,
you know.
Sure.

743
00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:35.710
I thought maybe you would want to check this out.
Uh,
here's an email.

744
00:49:35.711 --> 00:49:40.270
It says my husband had the same problem for a month when we started dating.

745
00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:45.220
He never had an orgasm during sex.
Oh,
Josh Potter,
Josh potters problem.

746
00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:50.500
He would always have to jack off at the end of sex and at first I thought it was

747
00:49:50.501 --> 00:49:54.940
something I was doing that was wrong.
Then I realize that when he was single,

748
00:49:54.941 --> 00:49:58.420
he got comfortable jacking off a lot.
So I say to Josh,

749
00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:02.500
when you get into relationship,
lay off the jacking off,

750
00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:04.750
get it out of your comfort zone.

751
00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:09.310
My husband can orgasm during sex now and anonymous mommy.

752
00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:11.630
<v 2>Wow,
that's cool.</v>

753
00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:16.840
<v 0>I think maybe a,
it's pretty good advice.
What is a Josh?
Think of that</v>

754
00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:20.720
<v 2>maintain Josh pattern.
You got to lay off the Gerkin Bro.</v>

755
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:24.360
Stop being alone and having,
you know,
hardcore,
fun,

756
00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.220
hardcore,
fun with yourself.
Uh,

757
00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.960
<v 5>I will say that I,
uh,</v>

758
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:35.180
I have gone periods of time without jacking off like extended periods of time.

759
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:40.010
And do you think it had any relationship with the actual sex then?
No.
None.
No,

760
00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:43.570
it doesn't do it.
It doesn't work because the cons of kind of seems,

761
00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:47.270
it's sort of what they mean.
They're like,
oh don't jerk off,
don't look at porn,

762
00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:51.590
makes more sensitivity and then you just faster or whatever.
But it doesn't,

763
00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.980
you don't think so.
It hasn't helped.
I mean,
how long do I got to go years.

764
00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:59.540
I don't know.
The concept of not pleasuring yourself,

765
00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:02.810
it's never gone on it.
Well it seems like it's elementary,

766
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:07.990
you know [inaudible] one gene,

767
00:51:09.801 --> 00:51:13.050
you nailed it.
Got me.
Probably set him up for that.

768
00:51:13.051 --> 00:51:17.320
And when you've tried this in relationships,
because I've helped guy,

769
00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:20.990
I'm dating someone,
I'm going to go for a couple of weeks without couple weeks.

770
00:51:21.570 --> 00:51:25.230
Cause that not enough.
So you have,

771
00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:28.020
you had a big buildup in there.
Like it's all backed up the pipe.

772
00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:32.720
If I'm having regular sexual intercourse then you know,

773
00:51:32.721 --> 00:51:34.610
I won't jerk off for,
you know,
cause I'll be like,

774
00:51:34.611 --> 00:51:37.880
I'm going to have my dick inside something here in a couple of hours,

775
00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:44.090
a vagina or a mouth,
you know.
Nice.
You guys.

776
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:50.090
Yeah.
Be whole and then it's still,
you still can't,
Huh?
Yeah.

777
00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.710
We got to find you.
So you've been,

778
00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:55.530
have any ladies reached out yet to help Josh View?

779
00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:57.290
We'll have to see.
I mean,

780
00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:00.830
through my travels I'll have to see if they're serious or not and their

781
00:52:00.831 --> 00:52:04.570
endeavors.
Any local women on city of Los Angeles was,

782
00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:07.610
if you'd like to make Josh pyre comes.
Yeah.
While I'm here,
you know,

783
00:52:07.611 --> 00:52:11.810
since I do reside in La.
If you do also then sure,
yeah.

784
00:52:11.811 --> 00:52:14.960
Reach out to me.
Other than that,
you know,
oh my God,
we,

785
00:52:14.961 --> 00:52:18.800
we got like a few people messaged me and they were like,

786
00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:23.600
I'm down to make Josh come.
And I was like,
are they in La County?
We need someone,

787
00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:28.370
La,
look,
there was a,
I definitely,
oh,
there was somebody last week.

788
00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:32.660
She was cute.
She was like,
uh,
I bet I could make Josh come.

789
00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:36.650
You saw that one?
Yeah,
no,
I'm,
I'm compiling where you are in the,

790
00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:41.000
in the country ladies and I am going to create a tour based off of where you

791
00:52:41.001 --> 00:52:44.120
live and you absolutely,
yeah.

792
00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:48.380
Have a make Josh calm tour and then you know,
the city that makes me come,

793
00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:50.390
maybe I'll throw him a special.
So

794
00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:56.510
I think it just goes without saying.
I mean this is,

795
00:52:56.511 --> 00:52:59.630
this is the grossest idea we've ever had.
This is pretty gross.

796
00:52:59.631 --> 00:53:04.580
You said greatest strong.
There was also,
um,

797
00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:07.880
yeah,
there was that,
there was an adult industry person who said that.

798
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:11.270
Did you not see that one?
Didn't you get that one?
Oh yes,
yes,
yes.
Uh,

799
00:53:11.271 --> 00:53:15.980
you know that one is,
uh,
in another state as well,
but you know,

800
00:53:15.981 --> 00:53:20.810
it could be coming up here on the make Josh come tour,
dude.
That's definitely,

801
00:53:20.811 --> 00:53:25.350
that's definitely an asterix.
Like you to follow up on that you were not friends.

802
00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:29.340
Oh,
am I going to not follow up on it?
I mean,
do you know me at all?

803
00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:33.690
Because she was like,
this message was like,
I work in the,
in the adult business.

804
00:53:33.691 --> 00:53:38.490
And like,
I bet Josh could come inside of me.
I was like,
wow,
respond.
Yeah.
Yeah.

805
00:53:38.491 --> 00:53:41.370
Hello.

I really appreciate that.
Um,</v>

834
00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:29.850
that message from a listener.
I think that's very thoughtful.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Yeah.

835
00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:35.400
Um,
oh my God,
this is,
you want to read this one?
Yeah.

836
00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:36.353
Here you go.

837
00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:41.310
<v 2>Long Ass fucking glasses.
I always forget my goddamn.
Yeah.
Oh,</v>

838
00:55:41.311 --> 00:55:46.230
Christ helps mom with conquering is the subject.
Hey gene.

839
00:55:46.231 --> 00:55:48.870
So I was listening to an older podcast where mommy,

840
00:55:48.871 --> 00:55:51.840
Tina was talking about eating her mom's edible underwear.
Yeah.

841
00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:54.900
And it made me think of my own gross asked right with them just to see,

842
00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:58.860
just to let you know,
I didn't eat the entire pair of underwear.
Uh,
my mother is,

843
00:55:58.861 --> 00:56:00.810
we discussed was mentally ill.
Yeah.

844
00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:06.440
She would show me about sex and she had a sex drawer that she would show me all

845
00:56:07.441 --> 00:56:08.610
this stuff in and she'd be like,

846
00:56:08.611 --> 00:56:13.110
this is edible and [inaudible] it tastes like Pena Colada.
And I was so young,

847
00:56:13.111 --> 00:56:15.390
I was like,
what's Pina Colada like?
I didn't,
I,

848
00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:19.330
I learned what a peanut Gelada was and what edible underwear it was all in one.

849
00:56:19.331 --> 00:56:23.320
So it was disgusting.
So I tasted it.
I didn't eat the whole thing.
Anyway,

850
00:56:23.321 --> 00:56:25.660
she says,
made me think of my own growth story with my mom.

851
00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:31.050
When I was 18 I worked in a sex shop in Culver city and my mom was very much

852
00:56:31.871 --> 00:56:35.320
privy to that information.
So one day while I was at work,

853
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:39.610
I seen my mother and my aunt at my store picking out items for their men.

854
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:45.520
My mom notices me and quickly tries to hide behind a small display table that

855
00:56:45.521 --> 00:56:47.410
had our newest collection of vibrators.

856
00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:51.310
As I clearly spot her and say,
hi mom.

857
00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:56.200
My manager quickly turns and busts out laughing saying how cool it was that my

858
00:56:56.201 --> 00:56:59.560
mom was a customer.
We worked on commission at my store,

859
00:56:59.561 --> 00:57:04.120
so my coworker who was assisting my mom at the time allows me to ring her and my

860
00:57:04.121 --> 00:57:05.560
aunt up gross,

861
00:57:05.561 --> 00:57:09.640
which is something I did not want to do in cabs but couldn't say no.

862
00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:12.850
So I helped my mom purchased a vibrating cock ring,

863
00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:18.180
five samples of Lube and over the counter hormone pills for her and her BF.

864
00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:20.291
Mind you,

865
00:57:20.291 --> 00:57:24.520
I had barely graduated high school and was mortified to know what my mom was

866
00:57:24.521 --> 00:57:25.450
doing in the bedroom.

867
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:30.130
This is just one thing I knew too much about in comparison to all the other

868
00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:33.880
nasty ass thing she had asked me in regards to her sex life.

869
00:57:33.881 --> 00:57:37.900
Keep it high and tight y'all and no,
I wouldn't marry my mom from Danny.

870
00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:41.720
That's intense
enough lube.

871
00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:45.300
You know how I fuck.
That's how my mom was though.

872
00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:49.180
And My mother would show me her douche bag,
like the old school Douche,

873
00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:53.860
like the bulb and the black thing and the orange box.
And she always tell me,

874
00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:58.240
men,
Bill,
not like woman,
this thing keep,
that's true.

875
00:57:58.390 --> 00:58:03.220
You'll have to vie showed a vagina and you cannot wear underwear to bed.

876
00:58:03.221 --> 00:58:06.760
You have to let your vagina breathe.
Your mom nailed some things.

877
00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:09.850
She does know that men don't like women was the pussies,

878
00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:15.370
but who likes anybody with stinky pussies?
It's not.
There's a few out there.

879
00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:20.220
It's true.
Maybe Jewish potter deal likes to keep pussies.

880
00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:24.660
Nah,
I'm one of those.
Uh,
those Weirdo is clean.

881
00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:31.240
I'm in to having a clean one too.

882
00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:35.710
That was pretty wild.
Here's a,

883
00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:40.690
I don't want to know anything about how much my parents though course.

884
00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:43.530
How much do you think your parents thought?
I've gotten a few over the years.

885
00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:47.290
Almost 40 of my dad.
You know,
we've had him on the show where he's like,

886
00:58:47.410 --> 00:58:52.360
I like a full Bush.
I like big tits to even that,

887
00:58:52.361 --> 00:58:54.730
I'm like,
it still feels like a,
it doesn't feel real.

888
00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:56.500
It feels like it's a character saying it and you know,

889
00:58:56.770 --> 00:59:00.390
but like to think about it,
we'll send me so nasty.

890
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.470
Well it's inappropriate your children,

891
00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:05.430
but can I tell you what I always think about Tommy when I'm,

892
00:59:05.730 --> 00:59:09.160
I thought about it even last night as I was walking around in our bedroom,

893
00:59:09.161 --> 00:59:10.840
I wasn't wearing a bra under my shirt.

894
00:59:11.290 --> 00:59:14.770
And I thought about how when your mom came to visit us about two years ago,

895
00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:19.170
remember I took her Bra shopping to get her the right size for her.
That does.

896
00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:21.470
Because they're low hanging fruit,
right?
Yeah.

897
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:26.950
And your father was very upset with me that I actually wanted them.

898
00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:29.180
Supportive Bra.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And,

899
00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:33.350
and I gave your mom to like a house Brah cause I wear like around the house

900
00:59:33.351 --> 00:59:35.930
without an underwire,
kind of a loose,
just something to hold them.

901
00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:39.830
And he said that he doesn't like her wearing that.
Even the,

902
00:59:39.831 --> 00:59:42.380
he likes it low and loose and jiggly right

903
00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:45.400
<v 0>around the house.
It's so disturbing.</v>

904
00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:51.520
I don't want to think about it.
I know.
Stop talking.
It's so gross.
Okay.

905
00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:56.380
What do you prefer though?
Would you want mine to be hangers low or too,

906
00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:57.400
I like you.
I mean,

907
00:59:57.790 --> 01:00:02.790
I like just you to be comfortable and however your breast hangs works for me.

908
01:00:03.070 --> 01:00:07.060
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
You don't have to not be like,
Ahh,

909
01:00:07.061 --> 01:00:10.610
I would love to wear a bra.
My husband's Dick gets,

910
01:00:10.611 --> 01:00:15.240
my husband gets real upset if I yeah.
He runs and makes your dad's Dong hard.

911
01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:18.520
Alright,
so we've got this other email.
It says,
Hey,
alert.

912
01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:23.580
Am I the only one that's going to point out how the hardrock nick looks like

913
01:00:23.891 --> 01:00:28.480
Tom,
who took a left turn earlier in life.
Carson.
Um,
okay.

914
01:00:28.481 --> 01:00:29.314
First of all,

915
01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:32.670
<v 2>first of all,
let me address that too,
cause that's some more retarded shit.</v>

916
01:00:32.671 --> 01:00:33.504
I'm going to get

917
01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:37.280
<v 0>so profiled hard rock nick,
last week.</v>

918
01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:42.530
It was pretty much,
it was,
it blew up in a,
in a lot of ways.
Um,
sky's got real,

919
01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:46.850
ended up opening the comments on his,
uh,
Instagram.

920
01:00:46.851 --> 01:00:47.900
They were closed before.

921
01:00:51.550 --> 01:00:55.310
That's brilliant.
Whoever did that.
That's Kyle Johnson.

922
01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:59.660
Oh my goodness.
But look,
if you go to his Instagram,
he had to close comments.

923
01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:06.440
Now they're open.
Yeah.
Just like Mcdonald's.
Uh,
Garth.

924
01:01:06.441 --> 01:01:09.920
They went crazy on it.
Um,
so here's what I want to tell you though.

925
01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:13.910
We didn't know a lot about and we just saw a cool guy and uh,
we,

926
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.200
we profiled them,
you know,
we just like played clips and,
and uh,

927
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:23.350
anyways,
we when it,
it got a huge reaction Pete.

928
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:25.070
Like they bombarded at his comments,

929
01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:28.870
he ended up deleting and blocking a lot of them to our listeners.

930
01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:32.980
You know who did that too?
Like,
um,
like we didn't even help with it,

931
01:01:32.981 --> 01:01:37.250
but Morton's did that.
But anyway,

932
01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:41.780
I didn't know anything about the guy.
Mommy army.
Let me just say this,

933
01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:44.810
I didn't know anything about the guy.
And then like we were sent,

934
01:01:44.811 --> 01:01:47.570
a lot of people sent us to this Twitter handle.

935
01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:48.800
I'm not going to read this whole thing,

936
01:01:48.801 --> 01:01:52.580
but you can read it yourself at B as in boy,

937
01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:57.740
d as in dog,
n as in Nancy,
deep B d n deep.

938
01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:03.020
That dude has a thread on him that is disturb.

939
01:02:03.030 --> 01:02:06.590
I mean,
you know,
it's just the guys.
Three Jon's style is dirty.
John's style.

940
01:02:06.591 --> 01:02:11.591
There's another guy who I guess used to be friends with him on on Instagram.

941
01:02:12.081 --> 01:02:16.160
That also has a thing going on.
But anyways,
that Twitter thread is pretty,

942
01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:20.310
can I see the picture of Tom Again as this guy?
It's my

943
01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:24.470
<v 3>favorite.
The picture of him holding the mic from him.
Which,
which score is that?</v>

944
01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:29.220
What?
What's special is that Tom?
That's from disgraceful.
Yeah,
I still fuck a lot.

945
01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:36.320
<v 6>Sorry to yell at,
you know,
and I kept thinking about this way.</v>

946
01:02:36.330 --> 01:02:37.310
Retarded man.

947
01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.930
I kept thinking about how he used to go.

948
01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:44.870
He used to have two Amazon packages a week and now it's down there.

949
01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:48.620
It's a crazy line.
Wait,
how do you even conceive?

950
01:02:48.621 --> 01:02:50.020
Like how do you want to think is a migraine?

951
01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:53.000
<v 3>No,
I dunno.
And it,</v>

952
01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:55.820
how was that a bragging thing that you went from two down to one?

953
01:02:55.821 --> 01:02:59.680
Like shouldn't you be upping your Amazon prime deliveries if you're a baller,

954
01:02:59.690 --> 01:03:00.770
you're trying to figure this out.

955
01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:07.010
I am trying,
I'm trying.
I know that makes no sense.

956
01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:09.800
Enigma and a new guys,
just so you know.
Yeah.

957
01:03:09.801 --> 01:03:14.030
You'll hear when we have Kyle and it's a a separate time.
So it's like,

958
01:03:14.031 --> 01:03:18.050
it's still kind of fresh to us.
Right.
So we're excited.
Yeah.

959
01:03:18.110 --> 01:03:22.580
But now it's like what's going on?
Yeah,
that's crazy.
Hold on.
Anyways,

960
01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:26.680
we uh,
we should be back momentarily with Fitzsimmons.
Great.

961
01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:34.440
<v 7>We'll be back to getting physical after this quick break.</v>

962
01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:41.670
<v 3>And we are back with one of my absolute favorite comedians in the world.</v>

963
01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:44.470
Absolutely hilarious.

964
01:03:44.830 --> 01:03:48.370
Podcaster and comedian and writer Greg Fitzsimmons.

965
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:53.310
<v 6>Oh,
I'll come back.
Boy do I like that intro.
That means nice to hear.
It's so true.</v>

966
01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:55.020
You're one of the best comedians in the world.

967
01:03:55.021 --> 01:03:56.640
One of my absolute favorites to watch.

968
01:03:56.910 --> 01:04:00.780
Thankfully you're here without that dumb broad you were going to bring,
um,

969
01:04:00.810 --> 01:04:04.960
with the dumb,
what broad doesn't even know that kind of talk.

970
01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:09.840
And that's how sweet Greg is.
Nice guy.
No,
I was like,
well,
we know you are.

971
01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:13.770
You have a isn't a new podcast with her.
Yeah,
we've done about a dozen episodes.

972
01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:18.230
Childish,
Alison Rosen.
She would've been here.
But as we all know,

973
01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:22.470
lot of women out there fully fucking full of shit and there's stupid.
Right.
So,

974
01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:26.340
well that's why you can't hire them because they're going to go get fucking

975
01:04:26.341 --> 01:04:27.174
knocked up.
Yes.

976
01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:31.890
Works and like this would've been a cool place to show the dynamic.
That's right.

977
01:04:31.891 --> 01:04:36.360
Two of you.
But now you know I'll have it with you.
I'll pretend that you're hurt.

978
01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:40.020
Okay,
I'll do that.
Here is a big news about her as you know,

979
01:04:40.021 --> 01:04:43.360
she's going to have the baby literally by the time his hair is,

980
01:04:43.361 --> 01:04:47.280
she may have had it.
Yup.
Yup.
And she's been constipated.

981
01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:52.500
Really bad.
Real where she's like using her finger to work it out.

982
01:04:52.501 --> 01:04:55.740
Wow.
Very hard.
Does that.
Yeah.

983
01:04:55.890 --> 01:04:59.410
And so yesterday she took ready for this?
Yeah.

984
01:04:59.490 --> 01:05:03.210
A nine pound shit.
Cause you know they,

985
01:05:03.211 --> 01:05:07.980
they way you constantly and she lost nine pounds.
Wow.

986
01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:12.090
She took a laxative and finally let it out.
It left like a week.

987
01:05:12.210 --> 01:05:14.700
Wow.
I wish we could've seen those logs.

988
01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:17.950
I mean that's going to be bigger than the baby.
How much is the baby?
Is the baby

989
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:22.780
<v 3>that is the baby baby weight.
She talked about,
what,</v>

990
01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:27.370
did she say,
what she saw in the bowl or no,
no,
she didn't get into the details.

991
01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:32.980
She's told me recently it's been all pebbles.
It happens,
you know,

992
01:05:32.981 --> 01:05:36.730
the,
the hormonal shifts plus your intestines are all scrambled.

993
01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:40.330
So yeah,
you have to be very vigilant about browning.

994
01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:44.050
And I was very vigilant with my browns every day.
A lot of fiber.

995
01:05:44.090 --> 01:05:47.660
You had to get it in there.
Right.
You know,
if she was that cost,

996
01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.040
but it may be dehydrated too.

997
01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:55.350
I think the baby can draw the liquid steel that liquid from you,
the executive,

998
01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:58.870
everything.
They're inside your body taking your shit.
Yeah,
no,

999
01:05:58.871 --> 01:06:03.540
I know fucking babies.
Um,
before we begin though,
I have a,

1000
01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:08.410
why am I,
where are we told about this or not?
I is a surprise.
To me.

1001
01:06:08.411 --> 01:06:12.000
It's get the exclusive out of the way now and for you,

1002
01:06:12.250 --> 01:06:14.960
while we're waiting for Greg to arrive,
I saw you need this.

1003
01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:16.660
I need some fucking music is a big deal.

1004
01:06:24.430 --> 01:06:29.170
I saw Josh Potter.
Yeah.
Eat something.
Whoa.

1005
01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:32.810
Josh is a comedian who also works with us.
He's just him.

1006
01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:37.240
He's hilarious comic.
He is a human cockroach.
He,

1007
01:06:37.690 --> 01:06:41.230
he's like 40 degrees is hot.
I don't eat,

1008
01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:43.690
I sleep from 3:00 PM to eight.

1009
01:06:43.691 --> 01:06:47.230
I can't come with a woman like all can't come with a woman.

1010
01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:52.570
He can only come if he takes over and strokes it himself,

1011
01:06:52.571 --> 01:06:55.420
but he can't actually finish.
So you can just,

1012
01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:59.080
he can just bang for hours and just be like,
sorry.
Oh.

1013
01:06:59.081 --> 01:07:01.520
So he can make love to a woman.
He just can't come play.

1014
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:06.670
Have you ever faked it because you were too drunk to pop a that's a good

1015
01:07:06.881 --> 01:07:09.220
question.
I did once.
You did.
Yeah.

1016
01:07:09.221 --> 01:07:12.370
And I took the condom off real quick and threw it out before she could see was

1017
01:07:12.371 --> 01:07:17.320
empty.
Yeah.
Wow.
What a life you've had faked an orgasm.

1018
01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:20.890
I was a man now see,
but we can feel,
but if you're both drunk,

1019
01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:25.150
she probably couldn't follow the condom on.
Now before we move on,

1020
01:07:25.151 --> 01:07:27.150
Josh ate a twinkie twinkie,

1021
01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:31.710
so we still still a cockroach is going to live long full of nasty shit.

1022
01:07:31.711 --> 01:07:35.890
And so I feel like I faked a,
coming with an ugly girl was like,

1023
01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:39.460
I just was like,
oh I want this to be over.
So I was like,

1024
01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:44.190
oh you do.
Cause I know about the trolls that you've parked.

1025
01:07:44.191 --> 01:07:47.710
You've told me
to all the trolls

1026
01:07:50.590 --> 01:07:54.030
when I fucked my friend's and yeah,

1027
01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:56.830
that was bad day.
Whoa.

1028
01:07:56.890 --> 01:08:01.440
I was 21 she was in her 40 or so,
like now that's crazy.

1029
01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:05.680
20 some year age gap.
And I was hammered,

1030
01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:10.810
I mean really hammered.
All I remember was that,
you know,

1031
01:08:10.930 --> 01:08:13.430
I definitely didn't finish.
I don't think I pretended I was just,

1032
01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:15.980
I just remember

1033
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:20.980
<v 0>dude waking up right and waking up and I'm looking out a window because I'm in</v>

1034
01:08:21.891 --> 01:08:25.700
bed and I'm looking out this window like where am I?
You know,

1035
01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:29.840
like totally coming to this is the next morning.
Yeah,
where the fuck am I?

1036
01:08:29.841 --> 01:08:32.450
It's like nine o'clock in the morning.
I was like,

1037
01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:37.100
oh so hung over and then I just feel an arm around me.

1038
01:08:37.101 --> 01:08:40.670
It's like a movie.
And I'm like,
what?
And she's like,
hey baby,

1039
01:08:40.671 --> 01:08:45.671
cause in the morning and I turn and it looked like bill Belicheck in a wig.

1040
01:08:47.810 --> 01:08:52.550
I was like,
oh,
and then she was like,

1041
01:08:52.551 --> 01:08:56.000
I'm going to take a shower.
I'll see,
and I was like,
oh,

1042
01:08:56.001 --> 01:09:00.320
I'm going to sprint out of here.
Yeah,
my clothes is all over the house.

1043
01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:03.280
I get dressed and I was like about to walk out the front door.

1044
01:09:03.310 --> 01:09:06.650
I realized not only did I not drive here,
I don't know where I am,

1045
01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:11.160
so I just had to wait downstairs,
like kind of pacing nervous.

1046
01:09:11.161 --> 01:09:15.720
This is before Uber.
Oh yeah,
it's,
I mean it was 20 so it'd be for me too.
Yeah,

1047
01:09:16.310 --> 01:09:19.790
yeah.
Then I see on the frigerator the report cards,

1048
01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:22.003
<v 6>seventh grade</v>

1049
01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:26.850
<v 0>and then you,
the best part is that when I finally,</v>

1050
01:09:26.851 --> 01:09:31.380
she drops me off and I was like,
oh my God,
my friend calls me.
He's like,

1051
01:09:31.410 --> 01:09:34.610
did you fuck my aunt?
I was like,
I think so.

1052
01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.940
He's like,
oh no man.

1053
01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:44.990
That's some real logos and your past real gnarly bitches in your past.

1054
01:09:45.090 --> 01:09:47.550
Now if I was here on a regular with with her on a regular basis,

1055
01:09:47.551 --> 01:09:50.310
I'd be like Josh,
I couldn't come either.
I would just be like,

1056
01:09:50.311 --> 01:09:54.030
I don't know what it is but I can't finish.
I had this SAP dammit.

1057
01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:58.460
<v 6>I had this woman one time and he was a Gig,
you know,</v>

1058
01:09:58.490 --> 01:10:01.100
I was a Boston comic and we would go out and you know,

1059
01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:04.910
me and Rogan and burr and all the Dane Cook we were doing,

1060
01:10:04.911 --> 01:10:09.860
why writers all over New England,
you know,
like seven nights a week.

1061
01:10:09.861 --> 01:10:11.990
Comedy was so we got so fucking lucky.

1062
01:10:11.991 --> 01:10:16.991
We were born into a time where there was just gigs everywhere in.

1063
01:10:17.661 --> 01:10:20.420
So like in the first year that we were doing stand up comedy,

1064
01:10:20.610 --> 01:10:25.190
we were on the road seven nights a week,
make you know,
making 25 bucks a pop,

1065
01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:28.160
maybe 50 on a good night.
But you were in your glory probably,
right?

1066
01:10:28.161 --> 01:10:30.440
You guys were making a living.
It's a shitty living,

1067
01:10:30.441 --> 01:10:34.310
but we were just smoking pot during the day.
Let's see,
in movies,

1068
01:10:34.311 --> 01:10:38.660
fucking around right material and then go on off to you drive.
We drive.

1069
01:10:38.690 --> 01:10:43.490
There was a Gig and it was in Maine and you didn't get a hotel.
It was,
you know,

1070
01:10:43.491 --> 01:10:46.820
two and a half hours away.
There was no hotel.
And yeah,
again,

1071
01:10:46.821 --> 01:10:47.900
make them like 50 bucks.

1072
01:10:47.901 --> 01:10:51.140
You spent half of it on gas and I drive up there with uh,

1073
01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:54.050
with another comic and we get there,

1074
01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:57.680
we do the show and it's a road house and it's a hell Gig.
And uh,

1075
01:10:57.681 --> 01:11:02.681
and I remember bombing so bad that I was on stage and I was doing jokes and they

1076
01:11:04.701 --> 01:11:09.230
were,
they were nice.
They weren't heckling,
but they're also not laughing.

1077
01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:12.590
And I did a joke and I overheard an older couple in the front row.

1078
01:11:12.591 --> 01:11:17.030
The woman said to the man,
the poor bastard,
oh.

1079
01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:20.460
Which was worse than being heckled.
And it was pity.

1080
01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:24.690
And so there was a couple of waitresses there and me and the other comic hooked

1081
01:11:24.691 --> 01:11:28.080
up with the two waitresses and he went to her place.

1082
01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:30.660
She drives me to her place.

1083
01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:35.900
She's in a trailer and she's got a three year old asleep.

1084
01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:38.670
Her mom is there and just says hi to me.

1085
01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:42.960
Like I was the boyfriend coming home from college and then takes off.

1086
01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:46.920
I go in there and she's a skank and so I don't know.
I don't know.

1087
01:11:46.921 --> 01:11:48.030
I'm sure I'm drunk,

1088
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:52.350
but I started sobering up and as we're fooling around I've just realized she's

1089
01:11:52.351 --> 01:11:55.440
just too good at this and I don't want to be,

1090
01:11:55.441 --> 01:11:59.250
I don't want to be with John Mcenroe of one night stands and man.

1091
01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:04.350
And so really you actually have that?
Uh,
like in youth to go like,
um,
I don't,

1092
01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:07.350
I'd rather not be that then have sex tonight.

1093
01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:09.480
I don't want to be a number of times.
Wow.

1094
01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:12.700
But this is also like 25 years ago we're talking to yeah.

1095
01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:14.820
You still have that mentality.
Yeah.
Wow.

1096
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:20.270
And so we get naked and I remember her chasing me around the bed trying to put

1097
01:12:22.891 --> 01:12:23.491
it in her,

1098
01:12:23.491 --> 01:12:28.491
she was grabbing it and trying to pull it into her and me pulling away.

1099
01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:32.910
It was like a wrestling match and it ended with,
it ended with oral.

1100
01:12:32.911 --> 01:12:36.650
There was a concession of oral,
you're like even today,

1101
01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:40.230
then woke up in the morning in her bed and again,

1102
01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:44.420
no fucking idea where I am.
I'm in Maine is no Uber,
that's the worst mom.

1103
01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:48.480
And so her three year old gets up and comes in and the three year old doesn't

1104
01:12:48.481 --> 01:12:51.990
even act shocked.
This is all normal.
And so I,

1105
01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:56.220
so I go back to Boston and about about three weeks later I ran into a buddy of

1106
01:12:56.221 --> 01:12:57.990
mine and I'm going to tell you off the air who it is,

1107
01:12:58.130 --> 01:13:00.630
maybe another Boston comedian.
Yeah.
And I see him in,

1108
01:13:00.631 --> 01:13:02.870
this guy was a horn dog and I see him when he goes,

1109
01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:06.660
<v 8>dude,
I just did main last night.</v>

1110
01:13:06.930 --> 01:13:10.980
Fuck this girl in her trailer.
I go three year old.
He's like,

1111
01:13:10.981 --> 01:13:13.020
yeah.
Ah.

1112
01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:17.110
<v 6>So we call the agent and we go,
we want to do the gig together.</v>

1113
01:13:17.230 --> 01:13:22.230
So like three months later we walk into the roadhouse shoulder to shoulder and

1114
01:13:22.811 --> 01:13:26.230
we see her,
she's got a tray of drinks,
practically drops the trade drank,

1115
01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:32.060
got to after the shell in my buddy's car double team and our what?

1116
01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:38.530
Oh,
I forgot to mention a detail.
She's pregnant.
Oh
yeah.

1117
01:13:38.590 --> 01:13:40.660
How so?
Much better than my story.

1118
01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:45.400
Like pregnant five months while we were there for three months before you do the

1119
01:13:45.401 --> 01:13:48.430
math.
Oh,
right.
Who knows?
He didn't know.

1120
01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:51.580
He never found out and he never found out.

1121
01:13:51.581 --> 01:13:56.290
He never got the call all of these years.
Oh,
cause you gave her mouth babies.

1122
01:13:56.291 --> 01:13:58.300
You didn't do.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.

1123
01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:03.190
Do you think she did she seem pretty good at that,
like she was,

1124
01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:08.170
it was like if,
is there an Olympics for oral sex?
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
Gold medalist.

1125
01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:11.770
Wow.
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
That's a good thing about skanks.
You know,

1126
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:14.620
they provide a lot lizards.

1127
01:14:14.621 --> 01:14:18.040
Have you ever seen or hadn't experienced in a lot lizard?
God?
No,

1128
01:14:18.490 --> 01:14:22.660
but it sounds like she was kind of close.
Like she's a comedy lizard.

1129
01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:27.360
Yeah.
What do you call common glazers chocolate fuckers.
Yeah.
Yeah,

1130
01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:32.380
yeah.
Well known ones out there.
Like throat Zillows of comedy.
Yeah,
there's a,

1131
01:14:32.830 --> 01:14:34.540
yeah,
there's one,
there's one.

1132
01:14:34.541 --> 01:14:38.500
I don't want to say anything in specific while we're recording.
Sure.
There's a a,

1133
01:14:38.501 --> 01:14:43.501
there's a city that I know of that like a lot of comics have had the experience

1134
01:14:44.861 --> 01:14:48.970
with one person.
That's how you,
I'll say you [inaudible] know in Connecticut.

1135
01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:55.260
No thought.
No,
but I'll,
I'll tell you,
I'll tell you when we're not recording.
Oh,

1136
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:59.850
okay.
Yeah.
I got to ask.
Yeah,
that's pretty,
uh,
that's wild dude.
Yeah.

1137
01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:04.020
Double teaming her team and her a little bump triple team.

1138
01:15:04.021 --> 01:15:05.460
And Are you still in that?
There's another year.

1139
01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:09.880
<v 9>Ah.</v>

1140
01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:15.060
<v 6>Does your wife know what a slut you were?
You know,
we never got anywhere.
Oh,</v>

1141
01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:20.630
she hears rumblings,
but she's not interested because we met at 30,
you know,

1142
01:15:20.631 --> 01:15:24.800
and you both,
you both have just,
you've been around,
you've both been around.

1143
01:15:24.801 --> 01:15:27.890
Like I remember trying to come up,
I used to have a bit about this,

1144
01:15:27.891 --> 01:15:30.870
like we are trying to come up with pet names for each other that we hadn't

1145
01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:34.130
already used on somebody else.
Oh,
right.
By the end of the week,

1146
01:15:34.131 --> 01:15:38.990
I'm Norman and she's dude.
All right.

1147
01:15:38.991 --> 01:15:41.930
Cause it's gotta be original to be a new one you haven't used before.

1148
01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:46.880
Connie's gone.
Babes gone.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
That's why we call it other jeans.
Yeah,

1149
01:15:46.890 --> 01:15:50.480
that's true.
You call each other genes.
Genes.
That's our nickname for each other.

1150
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:53.870
Sweet.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's pretty,
pretty cool.
But Tom was,

1151
01:15:53.871 --> 01:15:56.760
we hooked up when Tom was like 25 yeah.

1152
01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:59.660
And you still managed to be a real slut.
No,
I wasn't though.

1153
01:15:59.661 --> 01:16:03.430
That's the thing is the,
the,
they stand out more to her.
These,
the,

1154
01:16:03.431 --> 01:16:07.460
the stories because they weren't my girlfriends.
Yeah.

1155
01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:12.350
My number's low.
It's not very high.
Right.
So how's your numbers?
Hello?

1156
01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:15.170
I'm not billing.
She was all monogamous.
Like a fucking nerd.

1157
01:16:15.650 --> 01:16:19.910
I'm more of relationship lady and AIDS came out when I was in college.

1158
01:16:19.930 --> 01:16:22.950
Like then come out with the hysteria.
You have to wear a cotton.
I mean,

1159
01:16:22.951 --> 01:16:25.970
I had eight,
so I was in college at the height of like,

1160
01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:28.150
you're going to get aids and die,
you know?
Right.

1161
01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:32.810
So that was a huge deterrent for me was disease.
Hmm.
Yeah.

1162
01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:37.160
Well not like ethical or moral.
Yeah.
I kind of wish I could go back now.

1163
01:16:37.161 --> 01:16:41.100
And of course you can imagine if you put your mentality now,
oh my God.

1164
01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:44.630
Brain into like 20 year old you.
Yes.
So great.
I know.

1165
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:49.040
What would you do differently?
Just smashed it.
I smashed everything.

1166
01:16:49.041 --> 01:16:51.740
I mean that girl was a rare exception.
Really?
Yeah.

1167
01:16:51.741 --> 01:16:53.630
I put up big numbers really well.

1168
01:16:53.631 --> 01:16:57.320
I was at Boston University and it was just a 30,000 kids.

1169
01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:00.380
So like you could have a one night stand.
I never see that person again.

1170
01:17:00.410 --> 01:17:02.780
And you're cool with them.
That's crazy.

1171
01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:07.460
I just got an email at my website from a woman who said,
uh,

1172
01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:12.110
you don't remember me telling me in your ass.
She said she,
she goes,
I remember.

1173
01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:14.660
She goes,
you're coming to Boston.
I might come out and see you.

1174
01:17:15.190 --> 01:17:18.680
You won't remember me because we hooked up in college and I saw you a week later

1175
01:17:18.681 --> 01:17:23.650
and he didn't remember me.
I felt so bad.
Wow.
Yeah.

1176
01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:29.630
So,
but you are real slot back then.
Was it booze fueled or was it,

1177
01:17:29.631 --> 01:17:33.770
that was a lot of booze.
Oh.
So I think I was just very,
I was highly motivated.

1178
01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:38.630
Some people I think are just built to to fight.
I just liked on a night,

1179
01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:41.660
what's more fun on a night to start with your buddies,

1180
01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:45.260
get a good base of alcohol and the apartment.
Go hit a bar,

1181
01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:47.450
go in pursuit

1182
01:17:49.210 --> 01:17:50.050
<v 0>close</v>

1183
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:55.380
<v 6>and go walk home.
Whether it's the next,
next morning,
walking home at 6:00 AM</v>

1184
01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:58.820
<v 0>your bill,
you have to be built for it though.
I really believe that because I,</v>

1185
01:17:58.821 --> 01:18:01.130
here's the thing,
all my sex,

1186
01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:05.770
almost all of it almost came to me.
I was never like,

1187
01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:09.450
like I would be hanging out with friends who were that guy and then she said no

1188
01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:12.440
and she said no and she said,
and I would just be like,
you know,
oh,

1189
01:18:12.441 --> 01:18:15.620
someone just came up,
started talking to me.
Yeah.
If this goes somewhere cool.

1190
01:18:15.730 --> 01:18:18.680
Right.
That's why I think my numbers were never crazy.

1191
01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:22.720
<v 6>You it's done is a lazy hunter.
I was patty Stacy,</v>

1192
01:18:22.770 --> 01:18:26.510
hunter matchmaker.
It would be like you're a lazy,
Lazy.

1193
01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:29.760
<v 0>It's totally true because I,
the big thing for me was like,</v>

1194
01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:32.600
I'm not going to put in a lot of effort to this shit.
Yeah.
You know,

1195
01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:35.020
plus it comes to me.
Well it wasn't even like that.

1196
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:38.490
It wasn't like from like I'm too good for it.
It was literally being lazy.

1197
01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:43.380
<v 6>What are you good looking in college?
Was He,
he's handsome.
I you're,</v>

1198
01:18:43.381 --> 01:18:47.010
you're handsome now.
But I didn't know if you were like,
well here's the thing,

1199
01:18:47.530 --> 01:18:50.560
big difference between freshman year and senior year.
Yeah.

1200
01:18:50.830 --> 01:18:55.180
About a 70 pounds when I graduated.
Did you play sports?

1201
01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:58.060
<v 0>No.
Yeah.
So,
but I got,
I got to college,</v>

1202
01:18:58.061 --> 01:19:03.061
I was fat and by the time I graduated I was in pretty good shape.

1203
01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:08.050
So I sit of what most kids do.
I was the opposite.
Yeah.
I lost a bunch of weight.

1204
01:19:08.530 --> 01:19:13.530
But the motivation was probably to lose the weight was probably to get more sex.

1205
01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:17.280
Yeah,
I think so.
Yeah.
Cause you're like,
you're,

1206
01:19:17.290 --> 01:19:21.160
you're in this environment and then you're like,
oh,
you know,

1207
01:19:21.190 --> 01:19:26.020
I want to participate more.
So I just lost weight.
Worked out more.
Yeah.

1208
01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.450
And plus he's just so,
it's just knocking

1209
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:37.270
<v 6>so many mouths.
Yeah.
My God.
Yeah.
So nasty.</v>

1210
01:19:37.271 --> 01:19:40.710
So true.
Anyways,
so you have a 15 year old daughter now.

1211
01:19:40.770 --> 01:19:44.410
And how old is your other booboo?
My son is a senior.

1212
01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:49.210
Oh one no one's looking at colleges now.
Crazy.
Crazy.

1213
01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:52.240
We're at the opposite ends of the spectrum right now.
I know.
I'm,

1214
01:19:52.241 --> 01:19:57.020
we're like in today,
he pulled his leg up to his mouth.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1215
01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:00.460
It's,
it is such a different,
you know,
the crazy thing is,

1216
01:20:00.461 --> 01:20:02.620
is you don't spend less mental energy.

1217
01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:05.560
Like you guys are putting in the physical and mental energy,

1218
01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:10.110
but they get to be teenagers.
It's still just like,
you're constantly,

1219
01:20:10.111 --> 01:20:11.130
there's just meetings.

1220
01:20:11.131 --> 01:20:15.690
There's strategy meetings every day because you really feel like,

1221
01:20:15.691 --> 01:20:17.190
and you know,
most of the,

1222
01:20:17.370 --> 01:20:22.370
most of the reading I've done on parenting at this stage is there is not just

1223
01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:27.000
control the border because their kid,
their peers are,

1224
01:20:27.001 --> 01:20:30.130
have way more of an influence on them right now than you do as a parent.
You,

1225
01:20:30.210 --> 01:20:30.991
you guys would,

1226
01:20:30.991 --> 01:20:35.991
you are doing now in the first six to eight years is everything in terms of

1227
01:20:37.171 --> 01:20:41.820
their morals,
their choices,
um,
you know,
how they pushed themselves,
how they,

1228
01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:44.760
how they self,
all those things.

1229
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.420
They're learning now because once they're teenagers,
they're just,

1230
01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:52.440
they're liars.
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.

1231
01:20:52.441 --> 01:20:56.230
Teenagers just lie and you take it personally.
When it first happens,
like,

1232
01:20:56.370 --> 01:20:59.850
like we went out one night and we're like,
we're going to a fucking movie,

1233
01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:02.730
hour and a half.
And we come back and like,

1234
01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:06.390
we can smell liquor and there's a guy running out the back door when we get

1235
01:21:06.391 --> 01:21:11.300
there.
And I just remember I go,
oh yeah,
that's exactly what I did.
Sure.
Yeah.

1236
01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:14.100
And then they lie right in your face.
Who is the king runners?

1237
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:17.280
No kid ran out of the back.
Well,
what's the smell of booze?
Sandy rock.

1238
01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:20.730
I don't know.
Booze.
I'm just lying constantly.
Yeah.

1239
01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:23.730
And so you just got to kind of go like,
all right,

1240
01:21:23.970 --> 01:21:28.290
keep them from driving drunk and keep them from getting pregnant,

1241
01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:33.090
you know,
to you,
um,
when you,
do you go,
like,

1242
01:21:33.091 --> 01:21:37.890
I know that that's alcohol.
Like do you,
do you address the fact that you know,

1243
01:21:37.891 --> 01:21:40.950
you're being lied to or do you go like,
I'll just accept that.
I know that,

1244
01:21:40.951 --> 01:21:42.600
I know it's a lie.
Well,
the,

1245
01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:46.350
the dynamic that we're shooting for is to,

1246
01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:48.630
and it's worked with my son.
My son has,

1247
01:21:48.810 --> 01:21:53.070
is a different personality than my daughter.
My daughter is very like rebellious,

1248
01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:57.690
pushing the limits.
She,
she gets excited by being on the edge.
I like,

1249
01:21:57.691 --> 01:22:02.691
I remember when she was maybe six and she's in the living room and she puts her

1250
01:22:03.601 --> 01:22:06.630
arms out and she starts spinning really fast for a long time.

1251
01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:09.540
Then she falls on her back and while she's laying there,
she goes,

1252
01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:13.530
this feels so good.
I was like,

1253
01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:20.730
uh,
and so,

1254
01:22:20.910 --> 01:22:25.910
so I just try to not create this kind of adversarial environment where she's

1255
01:22:28.441 --> 01:22:30.540
going to want to rebel against us and hate us.

1256
01:22:30.541 --> 01:22:32.700
And they do the opposite of what we say and we,

1257
01:22:32.701 --> 01:22:36.090
and that we've been lucky with that.
We've,
when something happens,

1258
01:22:36.091 --> 01:22:39.660
we talked through it,
we try to understand why it's happening.

1259
01:22:39.661 --> 01:22:43.620
We try to let her understand where we're coming from.
And so we,

1260
01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:46.140
she's very honest when things go wrong and she gets in trouble,

1261
01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:51.090
we problem solve it as a team.
That's,
that's very unique.

1262
01:22:51.091 --> 01:22:53.260
It's the opposite of the way I was raised,
of course,

1263
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.180
which I think is a lot of what our parenting comes from is like,
all right,

1264
01:22:57.181 --> 01:23:00.090
what did my parents do wrong?
I'm going to overcompensate for that.

1265
01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:05.040
All all things,
but also,
do you think it's,

1266
01:23:05.050 --> 01:23:08.380
I mean from what I have learned in years of therapy,

1267
01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:12.670
the toddler years come around again in the teen years in a sense,
right?

1268
01:23:12.671 --> 01:23:15.610
So how they were as toddlers theoretically is what they're going to be like as

1269
01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:18.700
teenagers and also for the,

1270
01:23:18.701 --> 01:23:23.260
for them to be rebelling and to be pushing back on you is totally good and

1271
01:23:23.261 --> 01:23:26.740
healthy and normal.
And if they weren't,
then I'd be worried.
Right.

1272
01:23:26.770 --> 01:23:28.030
The ones that are like [inaudible],
man,

1273
01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:30.530
I'm just Christian and we're just going to Bible study.
Like right.

1274
01:23:30.610 --> 01:23:34.240
You're going to explode at some point.
Yeah,
and I think the shadow parenting,

1275
01:23:34.241 --> 01:23:36.580
it's very hard because as your kids get older,

1276
01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:39.610
like you have to shadow parent when your kids are little and they're learning

1277
01:23:39.611 --> 01:23:40.330
how to walk,

1278
01:23:40.330 --> 01:23:43.660
you have to be a foot away making sure that they don't fall down the stairs.

1279
01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:48.370
And then you have to like make this transition every year.
They get older,

1280
01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:53.700
you have to take a step back and redefine your relationship with them and give

1281
01:23:53.831 --> 01:23:58.060
them more freedom and let them feel autonomous and let them start to,

1282
01:23:58.330 --> 01:24:00.730
you know,
uh,
Kay,
like even homework,
they say,

1283
01:24:00.731 --> 01:24:04.990
don't ever ask your kid did you do your homework?
See how their grades are.

1284
01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:07.900
And if the grades are bad,
then there's repercussions.

1285
01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:12.640
Let them figure out and strategize,
get support them,
you know,

1286
01:24:12.641 --> 01:24:15.400
read their essays that they write.
Say if you want to show them to me,

1287
01:24:15.401 --> 01:24:19.480
I'll give you some feedback.
And asked them if they need support,

1288
01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:23.830
but don't hound them every night about,
did you do this?
Did you do that?
You know,

1289
01:24:23.831 --> 01:24:26.980
because then it's all external and you're never gonna learn how to do it

1290
01:24:26.981 --> 01:24:29.670
themselves and discipline.
Right?
So,

1291
01:24:29.671 --> 01:24:33.250
so you have to make this transition from shadow parenting to letting them,

1292
01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:37.420
you know,
make their own mistakes and have their own repercussions,

1293
01:24:37.421 --> 01:24:39.550
whether it's from friends or from teachers.
And,

1294
01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:43.360
and then you just sort of like support,
support,
support.
Yeah.

1295
01:24:43.361 --> 01:24:46.030
It's brutal isn't it?
It's really hard.
And then it's true,

1296
01:24:46.031 --> 01:24:50.410
their personalities reemerge.
Like my,
my son,

1297
01:24:51.010 --> 01:24:54.220
like he's very,
he's very much like,
um,

1298
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.670
he doesn't want us to tell him how to do things.

1299
01:24:58.810 --> 01:25:01.840
And he was about four and we were at the airport,

1300
01:25:01.841 --> 01:25:04.930
we're flying to New York and it was one of these like 6:00 AM flights where you

1301
01:25:04.931 --> 01:25:08.590
wake up at three 30 to get to the airport,
haven't had breakfast,

1302
01:25:08.591 --> 01:25:10.690
and we've got like an hour before the plane leaves.

1303
01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:15.310
So I go to Starbucks to get some breakfast and I come back and I bought him a

1304
01:25:15.311 --> 01:25:18.760
blueberry muffin and then I go to give it to him.
And Aaron goes,
no,

1305
01:25:18.761 --> 01:25:22.840
that's a chocolate chip muffin.
If he eats chocolate before the flight,

1306
01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:25.900
he's going to be bouncing off the walls.
Yeah.
And so I say,

1307
01:25:25.901 --> 01:25:27.730
and he's already got it in his hand and I say,
Oh,

1308
01:25:27.731 --> 01:25:31.300
and here you can have the muffin top,
but you can't have the whole muffin.

1309
01:25:31.870 --> 01:25:36.300
And his face turns red steams kind steam comes out of his ears to how old is he?

1310
01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:38.620
He's about four.
And he screams,

1311
01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:40.093
<v 10>yeah.</v>

1312
01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:49.990
<v 6>And everybody in earshot doubles over laughing this kid.</v>

1313
01:25:50.151 --> 01:25:54.020
And so,
uh,
and so he's like that as a teenager too.
He,
yeah.

1314
01:25:54.050 --> 01:25:57.650
The only time he gets mad is when we try to micromanage.

1315
01:25:58.130 --> 01:26:02.900
You know how he should live,
right.
The muffin.
He's a captain of two soccer teams.

1316
01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:06.230
Crazy straight A's,
you know,
girlfriend,

1317
01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:11.190
nicest politest kid.
Great.
Why fuck with that?
Yeah,

1318
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:15.920
no,
you've done it.
It sounds great.
Yeah.
Awesome.
Home run,
man.

1319
01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:19.160
Put all our work on the daughter now.
So fit.
But 15 is a rough age.

1320
01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:23.870
What were you like at 15 running the streets?
Really nightmare.

1321
01:26:23.871 --> 01:26:27.350
I had already done LSD at Lollapalooza.
Wow.

1322
01:26:27.710 --> 01:26:31.280
Smoking cigarettes into a golf clubs.

1323
01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:33.610
Golf clubs on school nights and shit.

1324
01:26:33.611 --> 01:26:36.740
Like running circles around my parents who weren't paying attention.

1325
01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:39.380
That's the thing is that my parents weren't great and they were not paying

1326
01:26:39.381 --> 01:26:42.050
attention.
If your folks pay attention,
she can't get it.

1327
01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:45.470
How much chicken she get into.
Did you have older siblings?
No,

1328
01:26:45.471 --> 01:26:48.080
I was an only child but then I had three stepsisters,

1329
01:26:48.110 --> 01:26:52.850
so the middle one and I got into trouble together.
But 15 is rough.

1330
01:26:52.851 --> 01:26:57.320
Especially now with social media,
we,
I didn't have that pressure of like,

1331
01:26:57.350 --> 01:27:01.190
I hear that teenage girls especially suffer because they're on Instagram.

1332
01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:04.850
And then if he didn't get invited to the party,
you get to see,

1333
01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:06.350
I didn't get all my daughter,

1334
01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:09.440
my daughter was in a funk for three days last week because she didn't get

1335
01:27:09.441 --> 01:27:12.710
invited to a party.
Let's Tara and I do.
And you just look at them and you go,

1336
01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:15.710
I wish there was something I could do or say.

1337
01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:19.880
And you just realize now they just have to suffer.
And it's,
it's so much.

1338
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:20.690
You're right,

1339
01:27:20.690 --> 01:27:24.190
it's more frequent now and it's deeper now because not only did you not get

1340
01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:29.110
invite,
you can see who did get it right and everybody's looks better than you.

1341
01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:32.450
Yeah.
The best pictures.

1342
01:27:33.370 --> 01:27:36.890
And you could see who's skinnier and hotter and who's got the cute her
boyfriend.

1343
01:27:36.891 --> 01:27:40.520
It's like,
it's way more pressure now back at least in the 90s,

1344
01:27:40.521 --> 01:27:44.360
we had these anti heroes as girls.
Like you had,
um,
you know,

1345
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:47.220
Janeane Garofalo you had,
um,

1346
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:50.930
the grunge look or whatever you had like Kathleen Hanna and Bikini kill.

1347
01:27:50.931 --> 01:27:55.890
Like you actually had anti girls.
They were Rad.
Yeah.
That thought,

1348
01:27:55.930 --> 01:27:56.661
that kind of stuff.

1349
01:27:56.661 --> 01:28:00.680
I grew up onto the eightball comics and now I don't know what the anti girl

1350
01:28:00.681 --> 01:28:03.170
culture is cause it's all Maine.
It's all Ariana Grande.

1351
01:28:03.171 --> 01:28:05.420
I like girls who look perfect and are a perfect,

1352
01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:07.580
I don't know what girls are looking through.

1353
01:28:07.581 --> 01:28:11.150
You don't see the the goth girls anymore.

1354
01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:15.590
There's no sub culture and there's no anti girly culture right now that I know

1355
01:28:15.591 --> 01:28:20.030
of that a young woman can be like,
yeah,
I might,
I'm not perfect.
I'm not a Barbie.

1356
01:28:20.031 --> 01:28:23.720
I'd rather be a little stinky,
a little weird,
a little punk,

1357
01:28:23.721 --> 01:28:28.640
a little whatever you have the Kardashians needed like a fat younger days.

1358
01:28:28.850 --> 01:28:33.090
They did and then they gave her plastic surgery and they stopped all our fat out

1359
01:28:33.091 --> 01:28:35.540
and now she's hot.
Yeah.
Which one was that?
He used to be,

1360
01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:40.600
wasn't Chloe the chunky and Kylie was normal of profile the dude as much and

1361
01:28:43.551 --> 01:28:46.420
then they did and he was fat or it was like you're fat and gross.

1362
01:28:46.421 --> 01:28:49.460
So they ain't tried to lose some weight.
And the WHO is the dude's brother?

1363
01:28:49.850 --> 01:28:52.830
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
So he got like,
you know,

1364
01:28:52.970 --> 01:28:55.100
he got a lot of attention because he's part of the group,

1365
01:28:55.550 --> 01:29:00.170
but they still would manage to shame him,
make him be like that.

1366
01:29:00.171 --> 01:29:02.370
Doesn't it suck that hot,
your family here,

1367
01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:07.560
but could you imagine it now like social media as a teenager has got to be

1368
01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:08.660
horrendous?
No,

1369
01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:09.950
<v 3>that would,
I think I would,</v>

1370
01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:14.120
I think I struggled a lot with teen.

1371
01:29:14.330 --> 01:29:18.620
Just the pressures of fitting into groups.
I was always switching schools.

1372
01:29:18.621 --> 01:29:19.430
I think.

1373
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:23.210
I think the reality of that without social media was a lot for me to handle.

1374
01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:27.050
I think that would be much worse with it.
I think it'd be much harder.

1375
01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:30.830
<v 6>There's a lot of stuff that our kids are going to go through that we did and I</v>

1376
01:29:30.831 --> 01:29:33.250
mean,
first of all,
school shootings.
Oh my God.
You know,

1377
01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:36.500
that's something that hangs over.
I mean,
they see it in the news all the time.

1378
01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:38.450
Regularly.
They,
uh,
my,
my daughter,

1379
01:29:38.451 --> 01:29:41.810
when she was in second grade,

1380
01:29:42.170 --> 01:29:45.440
there's a park across the street from her school and they were at this park.

1381
01:29:45.441 --> 01:29:49.160
It was like,
you know,
spring sucking,
you know,

1382
01:29:49.370 --> 01:29:51.950
play day where they have little contests and races and,

1383
01:29:52.490 --> 01:29:56.670
and there was a shooter who drove past and shots were fired over the park.
Oh.

1384
01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:59.860
Can they all had to dive on each other.
My daughter dove on a,

1385
01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:04.880
on a little preschooler and laid on top of her and then they had to go into this

1386
01:30:05.001 --> 01:30:05.940
like,
um,

1387
01:30:06.230 --> 01:30:09.200
rec area and stay in the basement for like three hours because the guy was on

1388
01:30:09.201 --> 01:30:12.320
the loose for like an hour.
He killed like four people.

1389
01:30:12.321 --> 01:30:16.220
Remember what Santa Monica killed like four people and then they killed him at

1390
01:30:16.221 --> 01:30:17.750
Santa Monica College.
Oh good.

1391
01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:20.630
So she experienced the school shooting in second grade.

1392
01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:23.360
We didn't have to deal with that.

1393
01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:26.250
<v 3>No,
no,
no.</v>

1394
01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:30.980
<v 6>That's crazy.
And,
and I think they are picking up on,
you know,</v>

1395
01:30:30.981 --> 01:30:34.580
your kids will hopefully,
hopefully the world will change,

1396
01:30:34.581 --> 01:30:39.320
but politically I just know,
you know,
they're,
they're looking at a world with,

1397
01:30:39.650 --> 01:30:39.950
you know,

1398
01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:44.950
politics that's so divisive and so toxic and they're looking at,

1399
01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:47.750
they know that the,
the does global warming.

1400
01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:50.930
They understand that,
you know,

1401
01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:53.000
they're looking at these dates to come out in the news.

1402
01:30:53.001 --> 01:30:57.250
I can 2030 if we don't turn things around,
it's too late and the,
and they're,

1403
01:30:57.251 --> 01:31:00.890
they're,
look,
they're going to be old during that time.
I'm,
I'm sorta like,

1404
01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:03.920
fuck it.
I'll be dead.
Yeah.
But they're going to be dealing with that.
Well,

1405
01:31:03.921 --> 01:31:06.770
I will say to the millennials credit and to this,
I don't know what's,

1406
01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:10.280
what's the generation after millennials,
I don't know.
Gen Y,
Gen y,
whatever,

1407
01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:14.510
is that they do have more of a consciousness about this stuff and the global

1408
01:31:14.511 --> 01:31:16.380
consciousness that we just don't have.
Right.

1409
01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:20.960
Because of the Internet and they create businesses that help the world and shit

1410
01:31:20.961 --> 01:31:22.940
like that.
So I don't know.
I think they're good.

1411
01:31:22.941 --> 01:31:25.250
I think they're going to create stuff that's going to help.
Yeah,

1412
01:31:25.610 --> 01:31:27.770
they have totally different consciousness.
I know they are.

1413
01:31:27.771 --> 01:31:30.630
They're good people and they are.
Yeah,
they don't,
they,
they like,

1414
01:31:30.631 --> 01:31:34.570
they have incorporated capitalism with like causes and shit.
Yeah.

1415
01:31:34.670 --> 01:31:38.570
Whereas our generation was like,
fuck capitalism man.
Reagan's,
you know.
Yeah.

1416
01:31:39.410 --> 01:31:41.640
Anti materialistic.
Right,
right.

1417
01:31:42.050 --> 01:31:44.900
They better be at 10 materialistic and not making any fucking money.

1418
01:31:45.230 --> 01:31:46.250
They're all going to be broke.

1419
01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:50.280
Everything's going to be automated by the time they get out of college.
Yeah,

1420
01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:54.710
that's true.
Did anyways,
here's a Fart Mike,

1421
01:31:54.711 --> 01:31:59.050
in case you have any,
I forgot to tell you earlier,
what's the Fart?

1422
01:31:59.710 --> 01:32:03.570
It's just if you have to Fart,
we prefer the really,
all right.

1423
01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:07.450
Mine are a little corny today.
Really dry driving up here.

1424
01:32:07.451 --> 01:32:11.680
I had an essence of ethanol to it.
Yeah.
What do you think that's from?

1425
01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:16.000
Um,
well last night our refrigerator died.

1426
01:32:16.001 --> 01:32:18.820
So last night we just ate everything that was in the freezer,

1427
01:32:18.821 --> 01:32:23.820
like frozen pizzas role and of course the fridge,
you know it,

1428
01:32:24.090 --> 01:32:27.040
the guy came today,
it needs like some kind of,

1429
01:32:27.070 --> 01:32:29.650
there's a starter in a refrigerator that died,

1430
01:32:30.030 --> 01:32:32.910
so we just killed it.

1431
01:32:32.930 --> 01:32:36.100
We just threw everything in the microwave and just sat in front of the TV.

1432
01:32:36.101 --> 01:32:40.130
You Watch Sopranos and fucking ate shitty.
That's awesome.

1433
01:32:40.330 --> 01:32:43.590
Now you must have some crazy for it.
Yeah.
The farts are in tents.

1434
01:32:43.970 --> 01:32:48.880
That's a great day to be here.
I just hope I can,
you know,
show up.
Well,

1435
01:32:48.881 --> 01:32:52.200
let me know when it's ready.
Okay.
I'll turn it on.
All right,
good.

1436
01:32:52.210 --> 01:32:54.240
So we got to get it out from under a no,

1437
01:32:54.250 --> 01:32:56.770
this is dangerous right now and the way it's rigged.
Yeah.

1438
01:32:58.150 --> 01:33:02.050
Little dangerous to be watched the show dirty John.
No.
Okay.

1439
01:33:02.051 --> 01:33:06.110
You gotta get into it.
What is it?
Netflix.
A con man show.
No,
no,

1440
01:33:06.130 --> 01:33:08.950
it's on Bravo TV and he seduces women.

1441
01:33:08.951 --> 01:33:12.400
Then he steals half their money and shit and he's real psycho.
Nice.
Yeah.

1442
01:33:12.401 --> 01:33:12.881
That's cool.

1443
01:33:12.881 --> 01:33:15.810
Get your daughter into watch it so she can be aware that their psychosis.

1444
01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:20.020
She dating,
she dating,
not dating.
Okay,
good.
She's a,

1445
01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:22.720
she's a surfer.
She spends a lot of times,
so no,
she goes,

1446
01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:25.050
you should go before school.
You should,

1447
01:33:25.190 --> 01:33:30.070
you should pull it to the left under here.
Like that.
Sorry guys.

1448
01:33:30.071 --> 01:33:35.071
We're having difficulties like ready to go for ethanol farts a couple of days a

1449
01:33:36.881 --> 01:33:41.830
week.
She gets up before school and goes and surfs in February in what?

1450
01:33:41.890 --> 01:33:46.000
In the Pacific Ocean,
which is really good kid.
Yeah,
she's intense

1451
01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:52.570
man.
Wow.
Yeah.
That sounds wild though.
Yeah.
And then,
uh,
they,

1452
01:33:52.810 --> 01:33:56.130
and then she's,
she serves for her high school team.
Yeah,
that's her,

1453
01:33:56.170 --> 01:33:59.530
that's her gym class.
It counts as a gym press.
I wish I could have done that.

1454
01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:02.200
Maybe these competitions all up and down the coast.

1455
01:34:02.201 --> 01:34:06.760
These surf against kids from San Francisco and San Diego and realize like when

1456
01:34:06.761 --> 01:34:11.761
she goes to college or even for the rest of her life and tells that to 99.9%

1457
01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:17.350
you're making that up.
Right,
right,
right.
You surfed for school.

1458
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:22.510
I doesn't sound real.
I want to join her shit now.
Yeah,
it's a she.

1459
01:34:22.511 --> 01:34:25.510
She's got a good,
and then skate.
There's a skateboard park in Venice beach.

1460
01:34:25.511 --> 01:34:28.510
You ever been to that?
I've seen it.
It's really intense.

1461
01:34:28.511 --> 01:34:31.390
They spent some money and they,
but it's like,
uh,
all the,

1462
01:34:31.391 --> 01:34:35.680
all the kind of tough punk skater kids hang out there and that's where she

1463
01:34:35.681 --> 01:34:39.670
spends a lot of her time.
Yeah.
Okay.
That's good though.
I'll tell you why.

1464
01:34:39.850 --> 01:34:42.530
She's going to be a badass bitch.
She will be a bad ass shit.

1465
01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:43.570
I ain't take shit from nobody.

1466
01:34:43.571 --> 01:34:47.200
She's already talking about the tattoos and you know,
we're not a teen.

1467
01:34:47.201 --> 01:34:49.900
I don't need your permission,
but if you give me your permission now,

1468
01:34:49.901 --> 01:34:54.470
I'll help you pick the one that,
yeah,
no,
I don't fall for that.
Yeah,

1469
01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:59.060
you guys have tattoos?
I have one tramp stamp I got in the 90s yeah.
What is it?

1470
01:34:59.090 --> 01:35:03.680
It's a dragon.
It's the lamest.
I hate it and I want it.
I want it removed.

1471
01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:06.260
You hit that Shit Tom,
all the time.

1472
01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:10.310
I got the word poison under my waistband with an Arrow pointing to my dick

1473
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:17.180
chicks.
Dig that.
A lot of college girls were into this,
stop

1474
01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:23.000
Craig's,
you happen.
He really likes that.

1475
01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:25.390
He really took hold the Greg fancy without,

1476
01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:29.330
I think the is all going to get Irish harps wants the kids are old enough.

1477
01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:30.710
Really?
That's cool.
Yeah.

1478
01:35:30.711 --> 01:35:34.490
Cause you know that was a symbol of the rebellion against the British when they

1479
01:35:34.491 --> 01:35:35.840
occupied us as they,

1480
01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:40.880
they tried to kill our culture by not allowing us to speak to speak Gaelic or

1481
01:35:41.541 --> 01:35:42.374
play the harp.

1482
01:35:43.290 --> 01:35:47.720
And so they would hide harps in the basements of farms in the country and then

1483
01:35:47.721 --> 01:35:51.060
they would sneak out there and they would,
uh,
they would have sessions,

1484
01:35:51.110 --> 01:35:54.740
music sessions,
and they play the harp
harp.

1485
01:35:54.741 --> 01:35:59.360
So you play the harp now almost constantly.
If you have you done shows?

1486
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:05.390
No,
dude,
I'm looking to,
yeah,
bring me with you,
man.
I'll go with Ya.

1487
01:36:05.450 --> 01:36:09.290
What'd you really fuck?
Yeah,
I'll go,
go.
I'll go for no money.
Just bring me,

1488
01:36:09.410 --> 01:36:13.310
oh my goodness.
Because my family wants to go too.
And I think we're,

1489
01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:15.140
I think we're planning a trip,
not this summer,

1490
01:36:15.141 --> 01:36:19.280
but the following summer with my mom and sister and everything.
So,
um,

1491
01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:22.490
yeah,
I mean it shows her apparently amazing.
I heard,

1492
01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:27.030
I think I would feel kind of dumb though.
They're just so,
they're,

1493
01:36:27.031 --> 01:36:31.040
their language is so much broader than ours and so much more colorful.

1494
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Do you know that I did a show once abroad where I was given credit for a concept

1495
01:36:39.621 --> 01:36:44.500
in the joke that I wasn't doing,
like in the writer,
like a,

1496
01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:45.171
they were like,

1497
01:36:45.171 --> 01:36:49.430
and then I read the explanation of how smart it was and I was like,

1498
01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:53.510
that's not what I was doing.
And you're like,
that was a Fart joke.
No,

1499
01:36:53.511 --> 01:36:55.660
I was just like,
I was,
they were like,

1500
01:36:55.790 --> 01:37:00.650
and then he doubled back on it showing us how his critique of like he was

1501
01:37:00.651 --> 01:37:02.990
playing the part of a dumb person as he said,

1502
01:37:05.630 --> 01:37:10.630
I was just speaking how I speak his persona and his sad tire we're dead on.

1503
01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:15.800
Nope.
That was just being me.

1504
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:20.670
Yeah,
you're right.
They are.
Yeah,
definitely.
Yeah.
There's,

1505
01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:23.420
there's like just a richer vocabulary.
Yeah.

1506
01:37:23.690 --> 01:37:26.420
They are way smarter than us and Europeans.

1507
01:37:26.421 --> 01:37:30.050
I'd say in general they say their high school education as equals like our

1508
01:37:30.051 --> 01:37:32.090
college education.
Absolutely.

1509
01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:35.600
I studied one year abroad in England and for college that,

1510
01:37:35.630 --> 01:37:40.310
that one year I learned more than my entire education in the u s were you

1511
01:37:40.311 --> 01:37:45.110
struggling where you like behind the other students?
Um,
I don't know.

1512
01:37:45.290 --> 01:37:47.420
It's different system there.
It's the tutorial system,

1513
01:37:47.421 --> 01:37:51.770
so I don't know the other kids,
it's like a one on one shit,
so.
Right.
You didn't,

1514
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:55.320
I don't know what other people got,
you know,
they're all smart.
Yeah.
Think so.

1515
01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:55.980
I remember my

1516
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:57.210
<v 0>classes,
what I did,</v>

1517
01:37:57.220 --> 01:38:02.220
I did a semester in Madrid and all those classes at University of Madrid were

1518
01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:08.010
way more intense than the ones back home.
Yeah,
for sure.
For sure.
Yeah.

1519
01:38:08.011 --> 01:38:10.710
He's fluent in Spanish.
I mean,
I pretty good.

1520
01:38:10.770 --> 01:38:15.770
I was completely rocking and rolling in that era because back then too,

1521
01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:17.150
not really.

1522
01:38:18.170 --> 01:38:23.150
<v 6>I actually didn't get Spanish.
I didn't,
I'd love to hear how loud was right.</v>

1523
01:38:23.210 --> 01:38:24.000
Damn.

1524
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.530
<v 0>And now I know.
I really didn't,
but,
but man,
the class,</v>

1525
01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:30.400
I mean you were those,

1526
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:34.650
they didn't set us up like Americans for classes in Spain.

1527
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:38.600
They just registered us for classes at the university.
Right.

1528
01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:43.320
So you're with this general pop.
Oh yeah.
So it wasn't English speaking classes.

1529
01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:48.580
Oh Wow.
We're doing term papers and everything in Spanish,
you know,
with,

1530
01:38:48.910 --> 01:38:52.340
with Spanish students.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That was intense.

1531
01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:56.590
<v 6>Yeah.
My kids both,
uh,
they go to a Spanish immersion program.</v>

1532
01:38:56.790 --> 01:39:01.060
So he started in kindergarten and hat and they spoke two thirds of their classes

1533
01:39:01.061 --> 01:39:05.980
for the first three years were only in Spanish and half the kids are spent from

1534
01:39:05.981 --> 01:39:09.610
Spanish speaking homes.
So they homes and so they,

1535
01:39:09.611 --> 01:39:12.310
so they like have no,
they're,
they're fluid.

1536
01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:16.230
They still take three classes a day in Spanish,
in high school.
And like,

1537
01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:19.750
we went to Spain and they're like,
oh yeah,
they don't have an American accent.

1538
01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:24.160
They have like a Central American accent because all their teachers are native

1539
01:39:24.161 --> 01:39:26.590
speakers.
So that's just how they learned it.

1540
01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:29.830
Do you speak anything else besides English?
French real?

1541
01:39:30.670 --> 01:39:35.080
Say something fancy.
A lick.
My scrum.

1542
01:39:35.550 --> 01:39:40.540
Uh,
like my be home,
you know,
you can just say something else.
Huma,
Paul,

1543
01:39:40.570 --> 01:39:44.110
I'll say,
you know what,

1544
01:39:44.111 --> 01:39:48.940
I speak it well in Montreal,
way better than in France.
Montreal.
They are like,

1545
01:39:49.150 --> 01:39:52.240
Hey,
this'll be fun.
Let's talk friends together.
You know,

1546
01:39:52.241 --> 01:39:54.190
he talked to the cab driver,
they're totally into it.

1547
01:39:54.370 --> 01:39:58.270
You go to France and you speak in French and they answer you in English.

1548
01:39:58.490 --> 01:39:59.820
They know

1549
01:40:00.990 --> 01:40:04.250
<v 0>Tommy here with Spanish where,
um,</v>

1550
01:40:04.370 --> 01:40:08.870
I used to do a bit about it that,
that when I would speak Spanish to,
uh,

1551
01:40:09.050 --> 01:40:10.880
a guy who clearly speaks Spanish,

1552
01:40:10.881 --> 01:40:15.170
like as in my mind as a way to just ease up,
you know,
make,

1553
01:40:15.171 --> 01:40:17.960
make it easier.
Yeah.
Like I know you speak Spanish,
I speak Spanish.

1554
01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:21.230
I'll just speak Spanish to you.
They would answer me in English.
Yeah.

1555
01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:25.220
And it was like,
they didn't like my assumption that I needed to speak Spanish.

1556
01:40:25.450 --> 01:40:28.460
Right,
right.
They would always ask me back in English and I'm like,

1557
01:40:29.150 --> 01:40:32.570
why are you doing my Spanish was better than your,
like why were just like,
well,

1558
01:40:32.630 --> 01:40:33.710
my English was good enough.

1559
01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:38.390
<v 6>Well,
a lot of times for first generation,
um,
Spanish speakers in this country,</v>

1560
01:40:38.990 --> 01:40:39.823
they,

1561
01:40:40.130 --> 01:40:45.050
they don't want to be associated with recent immigrants and so they won't speak

1562
01:40:45.051 --> 01:40:49.020
it.
And that's part of the proud,
this Spanish immersion program in Santa Monica.

1563
01:40:49.021 --> 01:40:50.570
It's called Edison Language Academy.

1564
01:40:50.810 --> 01:40:54.070
It's a public school and they can't get Spanish

1565
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:55.840
<v 3>speakers because the,</v>

1566
01:40:56.230 --> 01:41:01.230
they don't realize that their kids have an asset to be bilingual in this world,

1567
01:41:03.010 --> 01:41:06.760
but they are like,
no,
I don't want my kids speak in Spanish.
And it's like,
Nah,

1568
01:41:06.761 --> 01:41:10.190
it's like an insecurity that's keeping them from gap.
Right.
Um,

1569
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:15.040
are you familiar with Dad boners now?
So there's a certain type of guy.

1570
01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:16.990
It's usually guys,
honestly,

1571
01:41:16.991 --> 01:41:21.991
they're usually white guys and they get a level of excitement that is off the

1572
01:41:23.321 --> 01:41:23.711
charts.

1573
01:41:23.711 --> 01:41:27.940
Like the type of excitement you should reserve for like winning the lottery or

1574
01:41:27.941 --> 01:41:28.690
something,

1575
01:41:28.690 --> 01:41:33.580
but they get it for just goofy Shit Shit that you shouldn't get excited for it

1576
01:41:33.581 --> 01:41:38.110
all.
And we'd love featuring them and showing them.
So there's a new one,

1577
01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:42.130
but to get to the new one,
we want to show you like the exemplary dad boner.
Okay.

1578
01:41:42.270 --> 01:41:47.270
So this guy made a video of him coming to a part in the Trans Canada highway

1579
01:41:50.110 --> 01:41:51.660
where like it,
where,

1580
01:41:51.661 --> 01:41:55.180
where was it connected at some point and look at it,

1581
01:41:55.181 --> 01:41:58.420
how thrilled he is at a fucking highway.
Okay.

1582
01:41:58.630 --> 01:42:02.080
This is just to give you an idea.
So here's where it was paved.

1583
01:42:02.081 --> 01:42:05.170
I finally found this section where it was paved.

1584
01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:05.551
<v 5>All right.</v>

1585
01:42:05.551 --> 01:42:10.551
[inaudible] is the Trans Canada highway baby [inaudible] a bird.

1586
01:42:26.781 --> 01:42:27.740
It's Columbia.

1587
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:34.750
The kilometer marker 7128th.

1588
01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:41.300
And this is where I believe with a 90%,

1589
01:42:41.610 --> 01:42:42.740
uh,
no mix,

1590
01:42:42.741 --> 01:42:47.741
that 95% chance that this is in fact the very place where the Trans Canada

1591
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:56.080
paved.
It's last.

1592
01:43:11.090 --> 01:43:12.350
<v 3>Let's go for a run on her.</v>

1593
01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:18.360
<v 5>How's on asphalt belt and there says debacle.</v>

1594
01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:23.520
Woo.
I want to see if I can,
I gotta be careful here,

1595
01:43:25.780 --> 01:43:29.310
but
I don't want

1596
01:43:32.260 --> 01:43:33.093
slide.

1597
01:43:36.190 --> 01:43:39.190
<v 3>Okay.
It's a real person.</v>

1598
01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:41.950
I'm so jealous that he could summon that excitement.

1599
01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:43.033
<v 5>Right?</v>

1600
01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:45.580
<v 3>I mean,
here's the thing.
And then he joyful.</v>

1601
01:43:45.581 --> 01:43:50.581
Sometimes we've been sent clips of like a guy with a similar reaction to let's

1602
01:43:50.621 --> 01:43:53.960
say,
um,
well,
uh,
train.

1603
01:43:53.961 --> 01:43:55.820
We'll see what that would be appropriate.

1604
01:43:55.821 --> 01:43:59.390
I'm saying the ones that don't fit would be somebody seeing something in nature

1605
01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:02.300
like whale watching and they'll react.
I'm like,
yeah,
but that's,

1606
01:44:02.330 --> 01:44:06.890
that merits a huge reaction seeing something amazing.
Seeing a fucking highway.

1607
01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:11.810
It's like,
dude,
get your shit together.
Inanimate object and what's going on?

1608
01:44:11.811 --> 01:44:14.540
Their train thing of course was nuts.
So here's a new one.
Are you ready?

1609
01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:19.160
You haven't seen
God.
I love these.

1610
01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:25.380
<v 11>We're here for you.
Look over there.</v>

1611
01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:28.200
It's a vintage old Otis elevator.

1612
01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:33.060
Elevators and Florida in elevators.
Both film these before.
Oh,

1613
01:44:33.061 --> 01:44:36.570
look at the sign and leveled,
right?
Oh,
let's wait for it to close.

1614
01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:44.620
Nice elevator.
Okay,
awesome.

1615
01:44:44.621 --> 01:44:48.400
I love the smell of eight.
Are these your fixtures?

1616
01:44:48.610 --> 01:44:53.230
Otis with black buttons like the one at the Houston club building.

1617
01:44:53.530 --> 01:44:57.280
But unfortunately it got demolished.
You start jacking off in the motor.

1618
01:44:57.281 --> 01:45:01.540
Here we go.
Hit a number on the back of his hand.

1619
01:45:03.250 --> 01:45:05.800
It's a holocaust survivor hydro.

1620
01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:15.080
Ah,
it's an elevator down.

1621
01:45:15.410 --> 01:45:19.190
<v 3>Anything worse than getting in a shitty elevator.
Like when you get into like,</v>

1622
01:45:21.010 --> 01:45:25.310
and you can hear the oh well,

1623
01:45:25.311 --> 01:45:28.640
and apparently he hasn't lived in a shitty apartment complex.

1624
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:33.110
That's pretty exciting.
Yeah,
man.
If I know,
if you go to a fountain and vine,

1625
01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:37.040
there's a couple of ones might be thrilled.
Some Otis ones in Hollywood.

1626
01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:41.330
Jack Your Dick in any of the places we used to live in.
What's the,

1627
01:45:41.370 --> 01:45:45.980
what's the last thing you kind of got that excited about?

1628
01:45:46.490 --> 01:45:47.330
Oh God.

1629
01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:50.113
<v 6>Lexapro.</v>

1630
01:45:54.530 --> 01:45:58.490
<v 3>I'm trying to think.
You saw,
you'd make fun of,
you said,
I get excited about,</v>

1631
01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:03.080
I dunno.
Crime shows.
Getting seen.
Serial killers,

1632
01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:07.280
Ted Bundy,
new get new movies,
Hitler docs,
stuff like that.

1633
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:11.000
Not to get that level of excited like that.
How about you?
Oh,
I know

1634
01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:14.360
<v 6>my,
uh,
my friend and bought a,</v>

1635
01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:17.510
an old five 60 sl,

1636
01:46:17.511 --> 01:46:21.120
those Mercedes like the convertibles.
That's cool.
And she,

1637
01:46:21.121 --> 01:46:23.240
she fully restored it and I just,
I don't know.

1638
01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:28.190
I used to be a parking attendant for years.
Yeah.
And I,
and that car,

1639
01:46:28.191 --> 01:46:30.470
this Guy Ron Machete who was a,

1640
01:46:30.620 --> 01:46:35.620
he was the lawyer for the Gambino crime family and he used to pull up in that

1641
01:46:35.661 --> 01:46:40.310
car and I used to fucking joy if you're listening,
Ron,
for Shetty.
Thank you.

1642
01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:44.620
And uh,
sorry about the gas and I used,
I would,
you're right,
it,

1643
01:46:44.630 --> 01:46:48.410
we say it was fucking,
the thing was a tank and wait like 3000 pounds,

1644
01:46:48.590 --> 01:46:53.400
but it was a v eight and that thing flew,
but it just had the smoothest ride.

1645
01:46:53.730 --> 01:46:56.040
And so when she pulled up in that I had to,

1646
01:46:56.100 --> 01:47:00.150
I had to drive and she let me drive it and it's got the giant steering wheel.

1647
01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:02.880
I know you're talking about with the power steering.

1648
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:07.250
<v 0>So you got parents excited about that.
Yeah,
I get excited.
Happy.</v>

1649
01:47:07.290 --> 01:47:10.830
I really like cars.
Yeah.
So that,
but I mean I don't even,
yeah,

1650
01:47:10.831 --> 01:47:14.070
I probably would on,
on,
on a certain day if you show me a certain car,

1651
01:47:14.071 --> 01:47:18.220
I might geek out.
Yeah.
But what cars?
Muscle cars.
No,

1652
01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:21.140
I mean I like,
I dunno,
I,

1653
01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:24.830
I geeked out as a kid over a lot of exotics.
You know,

1654
01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:27.630
and then that's just like sports.
I didn't really,

1655
01:47:27.631 --> 01:47:30.900
I wasn't really in the land bows,
but like I like sports cars in general,

1656
01:47:30.901 --> 01:47:35.280
so like Porsche's,
um,
be certain BMWs.

1657
01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:40.110
I even like Mercedes,
like AMG gts I think are awesome.

1658
01:47:40.410 --> 01:47:42.750
But yeah,
I mean I've seen Ferrari's,

1659
01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:46.080
certain ones in person where I've definitely been like,
Holy Shit,

1660
01:47:46.081 --> 01:47:49.020
look at this thing.
Yeah.
Cause it looks like a,
like a painting.

1661
01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:50.050
It was like a piece of artwork.

1662
01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:53.520
<v 6>It is.
And it's,
and it's great because you can drive it.
Yeah.</v>

1663
01:47:53.540 --> 01:47:57.630
It's like a piece of art that you can actually take out an experience again and

1664
01:47:57.631 --> 01:48:01.260
again.
And you know,
they say money can't buy happiness,
but some true,

1665
01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:05.910
if you have a car that brings you joy every time you get in it,

1666
01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:08.220
that that improves your life.

1667
01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:09.430
<v 0>That does.
Yeah.
It does.</v>

1668
01:48:09.431 --> 01:48:13.570
If you get in a car where when you start the engine you're like,
ah,
that's,

1669
01:48:13.571 --> 01:48:15.610
that's happening to you every day.
Yeah.
No,

1670
01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.450
<v 6>I always liked old,
a old mustangs.
And that,</v>

1671
01:48:18.630 --> 01:48:22.550
that rumble when you'd sit down and you just felt it underneath here.
Part of

1672
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:27.350
<v 0>it.
Yeah.
And the noise of it and yeah.
Yeah.
I think those 66 Mustang.
Yeah,</v>

1673
01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:31.250
those are,
those are pretty choice,
man.
What's the fastest car you've ever owned?

1674
01:48:31.610 --> 01:48:35.570
The fastest car I've ever owned.
Um,
nothing crazy now.
No,

1675
01:48:35.571 --> 01:48:40.220
I've never had like a lightening fast car.
I mean everybody now too,

1676
01:48:40.221 --> 01:48:42.910
like even Rogan was saying,
you know,
that his uh,

1677
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:47.900
he got that a Tesla and that it's way faster than is a gt three Rs.

1678
01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:51.290
No Shit.
Yeah.
He's like,
this thing is insane.
Wow.

1679
01:48:51.291 --> 01:48:56.270
And they're releasing a new one test is going to release a roadster that goes

1680
01:48:56.271 --> 01:49:00.320
zero to 60 in 1.9 seconds.
She was like,
yeah,

1681
01:49:00.321 --> 01:49:02.760
that's out of this world.
I mean,
there's nothing like that.

1682
01:49:02.761 --> 01:49:07.370
That's like a second faster than a Ferrari.
I mean,

1683
01:49:07.371 --> 01:49:10.580
one to 60 miles an hour.
I mean,
come on,

1684
01:49:12.250 --> 01:49:16.810
let's do doing a quarter mile in like eight seconds.
Damn,

1685
01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:21.620
that's,
that's a really real question is how fast can it stop?
I know who he is.

1686
01:49:21.621 --> 01:49:24.820
Important.
Very important.
Yeah.
And they're doing it.
By the way,
that roads,

1687
01:49:24.821 --> 01:49:27.500
there will be $200,000,
which is a lot of money,

1688
01:49:27.650 --> 01:49:31.790
but it's a fraction of the cost of the cars that are performing at that speed.

1689
01:49:31.820 --> 01:49:32.541
Yeah.
So you know,

1690
01:49:32.541 --> 01:49:36.970
you're talking about La Ferrari or a McLaren.

1691
01:49:37.060 --> 01:49:40.520
Um,
see,
I know,
or the six,
seven,
whatever it is,
six 70 LP,

1692
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:44.390
those cars that are in that two and a half to three second rate,

1693
01:49:44.391 --> 01:49:48.010
third hundreds of thousands more.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Some of them were

1694
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:51.550
<v 3>over a million dollars.
Right.
And then test is like 200 grand.</v>

1695
01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:56.200
Go 1.9 seconds.
Tesla needs something right to come back.

1696
01:49:56.230 --> 01:50:00.310
Aren't they in trouble financially?
They've been in financial kind of trouble,

1697
01:50:00.311 --> 01:50:03.070
but I dunno,
I mean if this a model three really works out,

1698
01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:06.370
that's where that's the chief saved,
right?
Yeah.
That's,
that could be the savior.

1699
01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:10.060
How much is that going to cost?
It's supposed to be 35 grand.
Take one.
Oh,
that's,

1700
01:50:10.430 --> 01:50:14.870
<v 6>I have a,
I have a Prius right now and uh,
I'm kinda done.</v>

1701
01:50:15.230 --> 01:50:16.970
I'm kind of done your day.
What's going on?

1702
01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:21.740
I've had it for eight years and I just never felt,
I just,

1703
01:50:22.110 --> 01:50:23.240
I feel a little in it.

1704
01:50:24.150 --> 01:50:27.760
And I think maybe because I'm a small person that's like a complex for me sure.

1705
01:50:27.860 --> 01:50:31.220
Is when like,
uh,
like this guy in a pickup truck just pulled up next week,

1706
01:50:31.370 --> 01:50:33.410
I cut him off apparently I didn't mean to,

1707
01:50:33.411 --> 01:50:37.790
but it was a merging situation and he wasn't giving me room and I,
I took it,

1708
01:50:39.050 --> 01:50:44.050
he followed me home and I was taking extra turns to see if he was following me.

1709
01:50:44.210 --> 01:50:48.650
And he was in one of those big,
like,
you know,
Ford F two fifties,

1710
01:50:48.830 --> 01:50:52.990
which is so fun and cool cleaning equipment in the back or something.
Yeah.

1711
01:50:53.010 --> 01:50:57.020
You're a Douche if you live in a city and you drive a pickup just to drive a

1712
01:50:57.021 --> 01:50:58.600
pickup.
Yeah.
You're a,
yeah.

1713
01:50:59.710 --> 01:51:04.220
And so he follows me to my house and I stopped like a block short and he pulls

1714
01:51:04.221 --> 01:51:08.510
up next to me and he goes,
hey,
you cut me off when you're faggoty car.

1715
01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:12.110
And I just started laughing.
I was like,
Ooh.
Faggoty

1716
01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:18.560
that's really made me led.
So,
and it totally disarmed him.

1717
01:51:18.561 --> 01:51:22.990
He didn't know how to handle it.
Yeah.
Cause he wanted me to push back.
Sure.

1718
01:51:23.210 --> 01:51:26.960
And I saw him pick something up as he pulled up next to me.
Fuck.

1719
01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:29.600
So I was scared.

1720
01:51:29.601 --> 01:51:33.260
But then the laughter just diffuse the whole situation and then I let them
curse.

1721
01:51:33.610 --> 01:51:38.510
He did an ice chest full of curses for me and then he pulled off and that was

1722
01:51:38.511 --> 01:51:40.250
it.
Wow.
You imagine.
I mean

1723
01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:45.920
<v 3>crazy.
That's so crazy.
Yeah.
I mean I've gotten mad like anybody else,</v>

1724
01:51:45.921 --> 01:51:50.000
but I'm not follow you.
Yeah.
I had one time a guy accidentally,

1725
01:51:50.001 --> 01:51:55.001
I cut off the freeway traffic and he started to swerve his car to pretend he was

1726
01:51:56.331 --> 01:51:58.730
going to try to threaten to hit my car.
You know what I'm saying?

1727
01:51:58.731 --> 01:52:02.420
Like he was like,
man,
like that's a psychomotor.
And I was like,
Whoa Bro.

1728
01:52:02.421 --> 01:52:06.830
I was maybe 26 years old.
I was like in a Chevy Nova.
Like when are you doing bro?

1729
01:52:06.890 --> 01:52:10.820
Like I was with you one time where you scared the shit out of me when you were

1730
01:52:10.821 --> 01:52:12.460
at the wheel.
We were at,

1731
01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:17.560
we were the second car to stop sign going to turn on to a busier street and the

1732
01:52:17.931 --> 01:52:21.440
car in front of us like just didn't go right away.

1733
01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:26.780
She's like,
ha ha ha.
I was like,
oh boy.

1734
01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:29.260
And then when we finally turn it was a car,

1735
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:34.270
three guys and they just start to chill back to see like what's up with Rondi

1736
01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:37.053
Hawkins?
And I'm like,
yeah,

1737
01:52:38.030 --> 01:52:41.390
I'm sure the only reason I bad bad go with us more as the assault of the other

1738
01:52:41.391 --> 01:52:45.830
guys in the car.
Yeah.
But then I was like,
you are,
I never,
this side,

1739
01:52:45.930 --> 01:52:50.260
I must have been a weird day for me jeans.
I was like,

1740
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:53.470
do you always drive like this?
Like come on,
go.
No.

1741
01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:57.230
I must've been going through something that really want to be seen with you that

1742
01:52:57.360 --> 01:53:00.980
recently,
Evan,
I'd scare the shit out of me.
Like,
is this what you always do?

1743
01:53:01.150 --> 01:53:05.240
I said before therapy maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe it was a while ago.
Yeah.

1744
01:53:05.241 --> 01:53:08.450
It sounds like it's scarred you.
I'm sorry.
Yeah,
no,
I think about it all the time.

1745
01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:14.250
I was like,
Shit,
because it puts you totally campaign.

1746
01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:16.320
They're not going to hit her.
They're going to hit,
you know,

1747
01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:19.700
and then also I'm like,
great,
I got to get ready to fight right now.
Yeah,

1748
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:24.140
you couldn't wait two seconds at the stop sign.
That's the plan man.

1749
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:28.710
Just try and get you to fucking fight you guy or what?
Yeah,

1750
01:53:29.390 --> 01:53:30.250
<v 6>because been a purse.</v>

1751
01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:35.020
I had this guy one time and I was driving my son to preschool and so he's like,

1752
01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:37.330
what is that for preschool?

1753
01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:42.220
So he's sitting in the back and I get to a four way stop and this guy runs his

1754
01:53:42.221 --> 01:53:45.460
stop sign and goes wide in front of my car.

1755
01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:49.870
And so I honk at him and then he gives me the finger but he can't get past me

1756
01:53:49.871 --> 01:53:51.130
cause he went so wide.

1757
01:53:51.250 --> 01:53:56.250
So I got out of my car and I went up and I punched his window as hard as I could

1758
01:53:57.010 --> 01:54:00.130
and then he pulled away and I stood in the middle of the road,

1759
01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:04.990
waving them back and I look over and I see my son just staring at him and like

1760
01:54:05.230 --> 01:54:06.100
good modeling.

1761
01:54:06.910 --> 01:54:11.910
And so the guy kept going and then cut to like two weeks later I'm at a kid's

1762
01:54:12.341 --> 01:54:15.970
party and there's a little bouncy house and I'm watching my kid and this guy,

1763
01:54:15.971 --> 01:54:18.790
Jeff is standing next to me and he's watching his kid,

1764
01:54:19.030 --> 01:54:23.560
we're drinking fucking juice boxes and hate in life.
And he goes,
uh,
he goes,

1765
01:54:23.561 --> 01:54:26.830
that was me.
Oh,
I go,
what are you talking about?
He goes,

1766
01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:30.580
you punched my window a couple of weeks ago.
That was you.

1767
01:54:31.180 --> 01:54:35.950
And he was a guy who,
uh,
he,
he created lost.
He,
he,

1768
01:54:36.010 --> 01:54:40.090
oh,
he,
he was the,
he wrote the pilot with Jj Abrams.

1769
01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:42.730
Oh my God.

1770
01:54:42.870 --> 01:54:46.510
So he had a good take me back to what led to that though?

1771
01:54:46.630 --> 01:54:51.630
He went wide on the turn so wide that I had to slam on my brakes and then I

1772
01:54:53.741 --> 01:54:57.670
jumped out of the car because,
so he was stopped though once you once that?
Yeah.

1773
01:54:58.390 --> 01:55:01.790
And then you get out of your car.
I get out of my car,
punch the passenger window.

1774
01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:04.840
Were you afraid you break the glass though?
What did you punch a window?

1775
01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:06.880
I have rage problems.
Oh,
right,
right.

1776
01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:10.480
I've been arrested three times for fighting seriously is why I quit drinking.

1777
01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:15.340
Yeah.
That's,
I would never,
and I know I'm a very different person,

1778
01:55:15.370 --> 01:55:19.990
so docile and sweet.
Yep.
A lot of therapy.
Lot of therapy.

1779
01:55:20.110 --> 01:55:22.090
And I quit drinking.
Yeah.
That's probably huge.

1780
01:55:22.091 --> 01:55:25.440
She always have almost always had when I was drinking and uh,

1781
01:55:25.450 --> 01:55:29.290
the lights just go and I just,
I just snap.
But at that time you were

1782
01:55:31.180 --> 01:55:35.530
sober.
Yeah.
And so when you,
when he tells you that was me,

1783
01:55:36.460 --> 01:55:37.270
we laughed.

1784
01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:42.270
But it wasn't a good enough of a laugh to release all the awkwardness.

1785
01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:47.760
Yeah.
Right.
You know,
because I think we both have rage problems.

1786
01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:51.390
Him also.
Yeah.
Did He,
uh,
that's nice then.

1787
01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:56.610
Do you think that that he knew,
he knew?

1788
01:55:56.611 --> 01:56:00.060
Like when,
when he saw he was like,
that's Greg when you did it or no?
Yeah.
Oh,

1789
01:56:00.061 --> 01:56:03.750
you do.
And I think he knew that I was in a white rage and didn't even take in.

1790
01:56:04.170 --> 01:56:07.410
Maybe.
Maybe the light was hitting the glass.
I couldn't seem as well or whatever,

1791
01:56:07.411 --> 01:56:10.830
but I didn't recognize him.
Did you you,
so you knew him though at the time?

1792
01:56:10.850 --> 01:56:11.670
Oh yeah.
I knew him,

1793
01:56:11.670 --> 01:56:15.810
but you just didn't realize that we didn't realize it was him.
Fuck yeah,
yeah,

1794
01:56:16.230 --> 01:56:18.610
yeah.
You could have gone right through that window.
I now,

1795
01:56:20.370 --> 01:56:24.540
but I really think my kids,
if my kids have seen me get angry a number of times,

1796
01:56:24.570 --> 01:56:28.650
I try to control it.
But you know,
my father had it.
My father used to fucking,

1797
01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:33.000
I remember one time he,
uh,
he grabbed,
we were in a bar and he,

1798
01:56:33.001 --> 01:56:36.430
I saw him grab a guy and throw him against the wall and he used to come home

1799
01:56:36.431 --> 01:56:41.180
with,
he came home with a black eye one time and uh,
yeah,
he was,
he was a real,

1800
01:56:41.190 --> 01:56:45.360
he was six foot two from the Bronx.
So I got it from him,
I think.
Uh,

1801
01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:46.500
most definitely.
Yeah.

1802
01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:51.450
Plus that's a generation that they didn't have therapy or talking.

1803
01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:51.750
Yeah.

1804
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:55.080
You're considered a massive pussy if you share your feelings and that stuff.

1805
01:56:55.110 --> 01:56:59.370
Right.
So,
yeah,
I think it's in New York thing also for sure.

1806
01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:03.720
Cultural.
It's,
it's Irish.
It's very Irish.

1807
01:57:03.721 --> 01:57:07.950
I wrote a book called Dear Mrs Fitzsimmons and it was a collection of letters

1808
01:57:08.250 --> 01:57:11.490
that were sent to my mother throughout my life from from school,

1809
01:57:11.491 --> 01:57:12.870
like bad report cards,

1810
01:57:12.871 --> 01:57:16.320
let us was principal and then she would clip out when I would get arrested for

1811
01:57:16.321 --> 01:57:20.550
like vandalism as a teenager.
She would cut it out of the paper and she had,

1812
01:57:20.551 --> 01:57:24.390
I found a shoe box and the in the Bronx and the basement and it was a,

1813
01:57:24.391 --> 01:57:27.800
it was like a fucking trophy case of everything I'd ever done wrong in I life.

1814
01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:32.530
Now that's an odd choice that a parent would keep those things.

1815
01:57:32.710 --> 01:57:36.670
I wouldn't personally,
that's not something I would keep children's.
Right.

1816
01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:40.020
You know,
they would laugh,
they would read it.
Oh they would.

1817
01:57:40.490 --> 01:57:43.800
There was one time where I was at a,
I was supposed to be at school,

1818
01:57:43.801 --> 01:57:48.210
but there was a golf tournament and we went to a Westchester country club and we

1819
01:57:48.211 --> 01:57:52.200
drank all day was my,
me and my friend Nick Zappia,
he had a motorcycle.

1820
01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:55.860
This is when he would drink and drive a motorcycle and we went to the golf

1821
01:57:55.861 --> 01:57:59.340
tournament.
We drank all day and there's a,
and there's a,
um,

1822
01:57:59.460 --> 01:58:04.460
so I go home and the next day we're at dinner and my father goes,

1823
01:58:04.471 --> 01:58:08.400
so I was cool yesterday.
I got a fucking sunburn.
I'm like,
it was good.

1824
01:58:08.430 --> 01:58:10.170
It was good.
What'd you learn?
I go,
you know,

1825
01:58:10.171 --> 01:58:14.010
the usual math and reading catcher in the Rye,
you know,
everything's fun.

1826
01:58:14.370 --> 01:58:15.780
And he goes,
oh,
that's interesting.

1827
01:58:16.050 --> 01:58:19.830
And he pulls out the New York Times and the front page of the Sports Section is

1828
01:58:19.831 --> 01:58:22.980
Gary Hall Burger hitting a wood out of the woods.

1829
01:58:23.130 --> 01:58:25.200
And me standing behind him,

1830
01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:30.300
watching him hit the shot and he showed it to me and then they fucking laugh

1831
01:58:30.301 --> 01:58:34.170
their asses off.
They did.
They laughed every time they thought it was,

1832
01:58:34.350 --> 01:58:38.290
cause it's Irish,
it's like an Irish thing of like being rebellious.

1833
01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:42.720
This is great.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's kind of fucking awesome.
Yeah.

1834
01:58:43.030 --> 01:58:46.420
I mean it's not in like a parenting handbook where it's pretty awesome.

1835
01:58:47.180 --> 01:58:51.430
It's pretty great.
I secretly,
when my son is a little rebellious,
I like it.

1836
01:58:51.850 --> 01:58:56.710
I am like,
yeah,
you put a brick in it bro.
Like I'd rather him be like that.

1837
01:58:57.010 --> 01:59:01.780
Then compliant and docile.
I'd rather him be a little like,

1838
01:59:01.870 --> 01:59:03.490
this is what I'm going to fuck you.
You,

1839
01:59:04.830 --> 01:59:08.860
you know he's three.
He'll go,
I'd like to play alone.
Please.

1840
01:59:12.420 --> 01:59:15.130
I see myself in that sort of like,
once you just get away from me.

1841
01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:18.700
He's always saying,
especially when I'm like,
hey buddy,

1842
01:59:18.701 --> 01:59:23.470
I give him like a kiss I love.
He's like,
please let me play alone.
All right,

1843
01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:26.750
awesome.
I have to go like the other side of the room.

1844
01:59:28.260 --> 01:59:33.130
Give me a little fucking space.
It's great.
I love it.
I love it.

1845
01:59:33.190 --> 01:59:37.750
I liked it.
It communicates that way.
Really healthy.
Thank God.
Before we forget,

1846
01:59:37.751 --> 01:59:41.260
I don't even know if we addressed it.
Where can people see you coming up?

1847
01:59:41.261 --> 01:59:44.470
We were told Jesus for new podcasts,
it's Alison Rosen.

1848
01:59:44.530 --> 01:59:46.300

Dr grinned at the Bob Wright and then I'll be at the sycamore tavern.

1861
02:00:37.630 --> 02:00:42.630
March 12th Springfield Mass March 15 through six 14 through 16 and then,

1862
02:00:45.570 --> 02:00:50.110
uh,
March 17th at the Hollywood improv.
I do my big Saint Patrick's day shell.

1863
02:00:50.170 --> 02:00:53.160
Oh God.
You guys are around.
I'd love to have you.
Uh,
on it.

1864
02:00:53.420 --> 02:00:57.940
We have our baptism.
We marched on Saint Patrick's Day.

1865
02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:02.410
We did intentionally.
No,
you're right.

1866
02:01:02.930 --> 02:01:07.600
He did bro.
So we don't have to take another class.
It falls in like,

1867
02:01:07.601 --> 02:01:10.240
there's like a schedule.
When took the class here,

1868
02:01:10.241 --> 02:01:15.241
our first kid baptized and then we have to schedule obviously the second son and

1869
02:01:16.210 --> 02:01:18.490
they're like,
if you do it in this window,
you don't have to take class.

1870
02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:20.410
Oh no shit.
We're like,
we'll see you march.

1871
02:01:21.310 --> 02:01:24.610
Cause if we waited a month or something we'd have to do the whole thing again.

1872
02:01:24.611 --> 02:01:29.070
So how Catholic are you guys?
Not Very.
Just as a family thing.
It's called doing.

1873
02:01:29.810 --> 02:01:32.540
We're literally doing,
cause my parents are alive,
right?
Yeah.

1874
02:01:32.890 --> 02:01:34.120
We didn't do it in a,

1875
02:01:34.121 --> 02:01:37.960
I'm convinced my mother did it behind our backs because unit with Catholics,

1876
02:01:38.140 --> 02:01:42.590
it doesn't have to be a priest.
Anybody who's a Catholic who is in good standing,

1877
02:01:42.591 --> 02:01:46.930
who's done their confession and taking their communion recently can um,

1878
02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:50.260
can grab a kid and uh,
do a few prayers through,

1879
02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:54.320
took those fucking classes for right.
Well not only that,

1880
02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:56.540
we were going to get married on a beach.

1881
02:01:57.110 --> 02:02:00.950
<v 0>My Dad was like,
buddy,
you will break everybody's heart if you do that.</v>

1882
02:02:00.990 --> 02:02:05.330
And I was like,
what?
Yeah,
you got to do it in the church.
And then when I first,

1883
02:02:05.590 --> 02:02:09.110
when we were talking about the are older kid getting baptized,
I was like,
yeah,

1884
02:02:09.111 --> 02:02:13.400
I don't care what my parents were like,
what?
I was like,
alright,
sure.

1885
02:02:13.730 --> 02:02:17.390
Fine.
Yeah.
That's what I feel about almost all of it.
Like,
yeah.
All right.

1886
02:02:17.670 --> 02:02:19.830
<v 6>We'll give them the option if he wants to be Catholic.</v>

1887
02:02:19.831 --> 02:02:22.740
He's already in the system.
Yeah.
Big Deal.

1888
02:02:23.790 --> 02:02:26.300
<v 0>Grown further apart from it.
Oh,
like,
no.</v>

1889
02:02:26.460 --> 02:02:31.200
Like I was raised like pretty Catholic and I'm like,
I don't care.

1890
02:02:32.130 --> 02:02:35.430
<v 6>Yeah.
I was raised in CCD class on Wednesday,</v>

1891
02:02:35.730 --> 02:02:39.690
mass on Sunday and the,
all the,
all the,
uh,
all the sacraments.

1892
02:02:40.110 --> 02:02:43.560
I loved it.
I don't think good.
And then I had a very,

1893
02:02:43.860 --> 02:02:48.590
I was very upset when I realized that a lot of it was a made up.
Yeah.

1894
02:02:48.930 --> 02:02:53.280
I love,
they violated by that.
I loved it as a,
as a small kid.
I loved it.

1895
02:02:53.281 --> 02:02:56.460
Even like eight,
nine,
10 years old,
I was like,
oh,
this is great.

1896
02:02:56.790 --> 02:03:00.270
I had a whole thing I talked to,
I talked to God,
you know,
I,

1897
02:03:00.290 --> 02:03:03.000
in my head I talked to him.
It wasn't like the usual,

1898
02:03:03.001 --> 02:03:06.900
like begging for shit when you need it from God.
It was just more like,
I really,

1899
02:03:06.901 --> 02:03:08.940
they,
you know,
I grew up in a great church.

1900
02:03:08.941 --> 02:03:12.750
It was very like a progressive and I liked the priests and you know,

1901
02:03:12.990 --> 02:03:14.940
CCD classes were very enlightening,

1902
02:03:14.941 --> 02:03:17.940
great parents were teaching and I just felt really comfortable with it.

1903
02:03:17.940 --> 02:03:21.960
I didn't have,
there's a lot of shame.
Yeah I think.

1904
02:03:21.961 --> 02:03:23.220
But you know,

1905
02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:28.230
I think a lot of the new testament stuff really I connected with but it's all

1906
02:03:28.231 --> 02:03:29.030
gone now.

1907
02:03:29.030 --> 02:03:33.330
Your kids are they my daughter I think because she grew up with so many Latina

1908
02:03:33.331 --> 02:03:36.540
kids with the crosses and the first communions and all that.

1909
02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:40.650
And then my mother is Super Catholic so she takes them a church all the time.

1910
02:03:40.860 --> 02:03:44.370
My daughter loves it and she does.
She wants to know every,

1911
02:03:44.371 --> 02:03:46.680
she's a very deep thinker.

1912
02:03:46.681 --> 02:03:50.610
My daughter can sit and stare into space for a half an hour straight.

1913
02:03:50.611 --> 02:03:51.870
She was always like that.

1914
02:03:52.260 --> 02:03:56.460
And so she was captivated by the mythology of the church and like,
you know,

1915
02:03:56.461 --> 02:04:00.510
we'll go to church and she want me to explain like the transfiguration and the

1916
02:04:00.511 --> 02:04:02.100
ascension and all the,

1917
02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:07.110
all the heavy stuff and,
and it makes her,
like,
she,

1918
02:04:07.140 --> 02:04:10.470
we went into a church one day and she lit a candle and was sitting there

1919
02:04:10.471 --> 02:04:13.800
kneeling.
She was seven years old.
I was like,
what are you doing?
And she goes,

1920
02:04:13.950 --> 02:04:14.910
I'm praying for your father.

1921
02:04:15.690 --> 02:04:20.340
<v 0>Never met my dad.
I was like,
wow,
hmm,
whoa.</v>

1922
02:04:20.660 --> 02:04:25.080
And your is your son into it?
No,
no,

1923
02:04:25.740 --> 02:04:26.573
no.

1924
02:04:27.100 --> 02:04:29.290
<v 6>He's a into dianetics right now.</v>

1925
02:04:30.270 --> 02:04:32.560
He thinks he thinks it will help his acting career.

1926
02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:37.510
Now he's right at well fucking soap.

1927
02:04:39.210 --> 02:04:41.010
<v 11>So gullible till I was like,
oh no,</v>

1928
02:04:41.940 --> 02:04:44.200
I didn't want to say anything negative when he was looking straight A's.

1929
02:04:44.370 --> 02:04:46.230
It's like the boy scouts,
but it's dianetics

1930
02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:52.880
<v 0>dude.
And you are the best.
Uh,
absolutely.
When I say this,
I've,
I've not,</v>

1931
02:04:52.920 --> 02:04:54.480
I don't say this about most people.

1932
02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:59.250
One of the best comedians I've ever seen really is every time,
anywhere.

1933
02:04:59.251 --> 02:05:02.440
And you're onstage.
I make it a point.
Yes.
Yes.
Stay in the room.

1934
02:05:02.441 --> 02:05:06.900
And that's really nice.
Thank you so much Amy.
You are one of the best.

1935
02:05:06.930 --> 02:05:09.540
Go see him live a download,

1936
02:05:09.541 --> 02:05:14.541
subscribe rate and review the childish podcasts that he's down doing with uh,

1937
02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:19.580
Alison Rosen who,
uh,
got bless hope everything's well.
Yeah.

1938
02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:23.250
In the hospital.
And um,
that's that.

1939
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:26.480
<v 11>That's it.
Thank you for coming to me on.
Great saying.
Yeah,</v>

1940
02:05:30.430 --> 02:05:35.400
we'll be back to loving each other,
all of us after this quick break.

1941
02:05:36.910 --> 02:05:41.440
<v 0>And finally,
I mean finally people are like,</v>

1942
02:05:41.441 --> 02:05:44.320
what's the beef?
Do you guys have beef?
It's like,
yeah man,

1943
02:05:44.321 --> 02:05:45.790
we've been butting heads for years,

1944
02:05:46.120 --> 02:05:50.020
but we were able to squash that beef just for the podcast in the world.
Sure.

1945
02:05:50.620 --> 02:05:53.800
Good friend,
hilarious comedian Kyle Kinane.

1946
02:05:54.700 --> 02:05:58.210
Oh No,
no.
It's weird.
People say Shit like that and they'll be like,

1947
02:05:58.750 --> 02:06:00.840
absolutely no.

1948
02:06:00.880 --> 02:06:04.750
Just like when you have like obviously we've been friends with Kyle for over a

1949
02:06:04.750 --> 02:06:06.730
decade and then it just occurs to you,
you're like,
oh yeah,

1950
02:06:06.731 --> 02:06:09.550
we've never podcasted but I've never,
I never,
I don't know.

1951
02:06:09.580 --> 02:06:12.460
I've never given thought to something like that.
Like you just go like,

1952
02:06:12.910 --> 02:06:14.080
I dunno what that hurts.

1953
02:06:14.220 --> 02:06:16.500
<v 11>Well,
I'm sorry,
but I mean,</v>

1954
02:06:16.501 --> 02:06:20.250
have we been friends this whole time that I thought so.
I mean,
I just don't,

1955
02:06:20.251 --> 02:06:21.530
I don't know.
I sometimes

1956
02:06:22.020 --> 02:06:24.600
<v 0>you look at the a list of names that you realize you're like,
oh,</v>

1957
02:06:24.601 --> 02:06:28.950
I've never podcasted with this person.
But it's only for just absent minded.

1958
02:06:29.180 --> 02:06:33.770
<v 11>Yeah.
What about the forgettable Kyle Kinane we can have,
no,</v>

1959
02:06:33.771 --> 02:06:38.000
you're not forgetting how we got beef,
Bro.
No,
you're amazing.
You're amazing.

1960
02:06:38.001 --> 02:06:42.040
And you came here to start beef.
I love it.
I fucking,
I dunno.

1961
02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:46.370
I think you're very funny.
Why didn't you have Kyle on before?
Oh,

1962
02:06:46.371 --> 02:06:50.090
he's very busy.
He's always on the road.
He's always doing stuff.

1963
02:06:50.420 --> 02:06:51.980
I've been around for like six weeks right now guys.

1964
02:06:52.460 --> 02:06:56.120
And he's a chapstick enthusiast?
Yeah.
Oh God.
I'm into that lip balm.

1965
02:06:56.180 --> 02:06:58.370
What kind of you?
God,
let's talk about it.
You know what?

1966
02:06:58.371 --> 02:07:02.090
This is a random one at home at my house that didn't have a label on it.
So,
oh,

1967
02:07:02.091 --> 02:07:05.210
let me look at it.
Open it up.
I'll tell you what though.
Gee,
it looks,

1968
02:07:05.211 --> 02:07:08.210
Oh gee medicated.
Yeah,
right when it go original,

1969
02:07:08.500 --> 02:07:12.800
does it smell like an original chapstick?
Is it kind of Medicaid?
Yeah.

1970
02:07:12.820 --> 02:07:16.700
Mediciny I think it's just,
Oh gee,
hmm.
Ooh,

1971
02:07:17.150 --> 02:07:21.230
oh by the way,
Kyle,
we have a fart mind here.
I don't know what you had for lunch,

1972
02:07:21.260 --> 02:07:22.280
but if you feel like farting,

1973
02:07:22.281 --> 02:07:25.010
there's a microphone here and just let me know and we'll turn it on and you can

1974
02:07:25.011 --> 02:07:25.844
fire it into it.

1975
02:07:26.040 --> 02:07:30.840
<v 0>Oh,
it's her idea who's taking,
who's taking you up on that?</v>

1976
02:07:31.350 --> 02:07:32.540
Oh,
let her answer that.

1977
02:07:32.730 --> 02:07:35.890
<v 11>I mean I have have has a guest farted yet.</v>

1978
02:07:36.370 --> 02:07:40.690
<v 13>Nope.
What's the,
what's the maintenance of that microphone between</v>

1979
02:07:42.950 --> 02:07:45.790
usually goes from,
Christine has asked to the desk.

1980
02:07:48.300 --> 02:07:51.640
She didn't,
she didn't want us to,
when we met,

1981
02:07:51.641 --> 02:07:55.570
we were having this studio set up and I was like,
so we'll shoot next week.

1982
02:07:55.571 --> 02:07:57.970
And she was like,
is the Fart Mike Ready?
I was like,

1983
02:07:58.290 --> 02:07:59.920
I'm not really worried about that.
And she was like,

1984
02:08:00.070 --> 02:08:01.690
why are we even moving to that studio?

1985
02:08:03.670 --> 02:08:07.630
Which 12 year old version of what he was like one day.

1986
02:08:09.370 --> 02:08:11.050
Cause I had mixed.
I'd mix tapes.

1987
02:08:11.051 --> 02:08:15.580
I've just farting at a boombox fact that you have the actual,

1988
02:08:15.581 --> 02:08:20.410
what does that sm 58 I'm sure the Shure sm 58 sorry,

1989
02:08:20.411 --> 02:08:25.411
this is the 48 did you go into guitar center with like the specifics of like,

1990
02:08:26.770 --> 02:08:31.030
I need a microphone for a very,
very special specialized.

1991
02:08:31.090 --> 02:08:34.240
There's a specific mission where I'm like,
is it unidirectional?
Oh yeah,

1992
02:08:35.020 --> 02:08:37.150
it's coming down from,
it's a one way.

1993
02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:42.700
What did you say you fired out of a boom.

1994
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:47.790
Box it into a boombox back when you could just record that it has the built in

1995
02:08:48.491 --> 02:08:49.120
microphone.

1996
02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:54.010
That was the funniest thing I could've ever heard as a child was to fart and

1997
02:08:54.011 --> 02:08:57.200
then play it back.
Yeah,

1998
02:08:57.680 --> 02:09:02.530
just blasted into the Magnavox.
Yeah.
How old were you think that's smart.

1999
02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:07.450
I think I said too.
I think I'd be single digits.
Oh yeah.

2000
02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:10.600
I think I was even younger than that.
Back when the double deck,

2001
02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:11.750
the double deckers Dina,

2002
02:09:11.770 --> 02:09:16.220
you hear that single digits maybe eight or nine years old.
He was that.
He was,

2003
02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:19.390
he invented fart and here's a fart Mike.
Right now for us.

2004
02:09:20.260 --> 02:09:24.700
I'll see what I can do here.
You're more than welcome to it,
you know,

2005
02:09:25.060 --> 02:09:27.840
just give us a signal if you don't mind.
I haven't had my mom's like,

2006
02:09:27.850 --> 02:09:32.560
she was sad with what I've done.
Let's see.
We can get that ticker count.

2007
02:09:35.010 --> 02:09:37.780
Are you on a Vegan Diet?
Vegetarian,

2008
02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:45.760
which means I made some Mac and cheese and I made a can of Amy's Chili and I

2009
02:09:45.761 --> 02:09:49.600
just mixed them together today.
Me being a chef

2010
02:09:54.990 --> 02:09:59.410
coffee,
I might just shit right into the thing.
Oh yeah.

2011
02:10:00.550 --> 02:10:04.430
Dude.
Can you imagine how fucking epic that would be for a podcast clip?

2012
02:10:05.290 --> 02:10:07.240
Kyle grabbed the fart Mike and they shit all over

2013
02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:14.950
in the podcasting world.
He left Hollywood.

2014
02:10:16.540 --> 02:10:18.460
A lot of people do stuff that's career ending.

2015
02:10:18.461 --> 02:10:22.240
He truly executed his own career.
Man.

2016
02:10:22.750 --> 02:10:25.240
I wish that would happen right when shit on the FARC.
Mike,

2017
02:10:25.260 --> 02:10:28.030
this guy doesn't know how to do anything.
Half assed speed.

2018
02:10:30.180 --> 02:10:33.890
I'm going to be a go get her in this town,
man.
That's for sure.

2019
02:10:34.250 --> 02:10:36.130
<v 0>I've met Kyle,
uh,</v>

2020
02:10:36.170 --> 02:10:40.280
32 years ago when we started stand up and went back one.
Yeah,

2021
02:10:40.610 --> 02:10:45.140
we did our,
uh,
comedy central half hours.
That's right.
Same night.

2022
02:10:45.290 --> 02:10:48.900
Oh man,
that you put that picture up a few weeks ago.
Yup.

2023
02:10:49.070 --> 02:10:50.360
That was the same night.

2024
02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:53.500
I look at all the half hours now and people like the audience was great,

2025
02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:56.330
everything was great.
I'm like,
I hated it.
Yeah.
It was miserable.

2026
02:10:56.331 --> 02:11:00.980
I remember how nerve racking it was like the going into it,
you know,

2027
02:11:00.981 --> 02:11:05.150
like there was like this stepping stone,
uh,
kind of thing.

2028
02:11:05.151 --> 02:11:07.520
You would try to figure out like,
oh,
people get hours,

2029
02:11:07.521 --> 02:11:11.810
but before that you get half an hour and I don't know about you,
but I was,

2030
02:11:11.990 --> 02:11:14.460
I was having my managers submit.
Yeah.

2031
02:11:14.461 --> 02:11:18.320
And so it was like the first year they said,
well,
no,

2032
02:11:18.740 --> 02:11:23.730
but you're on the radar.
And then I was like,
oh,
okay.
And then the second year,

2033
02:11:23.731 --> 02:11:24.080
right.

2034
02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:27.780
<v 13>Good manager thing to say that nobody gives a fuck about you.
Yeah.</v>

2035
02:11:27.820 --> 02:11:29.290
You're on the radar and the radar

2036
02:11:33.100 --> 02:11:37.870
that's casting every,
every casting session they really loved.
The next year

2037
02:11:37.900 --> 02:11:42.850
<v 0>it was,
um,
they are the hero.
No,</v>

2038
02:11:42.851 --> 02:11:46.780
but you're going to get one.
I was like,
ah,
I don't,

2039
02:11:47.250 --> 02:11:49.870
I don't even remember the process leading up to it.
No,

2040
02:11:49.900 --> 02:11:54.160
I think I was in a high time of like,

2041
02:11:55.600 --> 02:11:58.420
I'm just going to do whatever.
I was like starting to tour and do my own,

2042
02:11:58.421 --> 02:12:02.320
like DIY shit,
and then if stuff came around I was like,
oh,
that's cool.
All right,

2043
02:12:02.321 --> 02:12:06.000
I'll do the half hour.
And then I was kind of a,

2044
02:12:06.070 --> 02:12:10.830
not unappreciative,
but I may like nobody.
Did it change anything for you?

2045
02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:13.750
Watched him now?
I don't know.

2046
02:12:13.751 --> 02:12:17.290
Because then you look at the collection of your career,
like where you were then,

2047
02:12:17.291 --> 02:12:18.540
where you are now.
So who knows?
He knows

2048
02:12:18.540 --> 02:12:21.210
<v 13>which one of those things.
That's true.
Led to the next thing.</v>

2049
02:12:21.810 --> 02:12:25.890
I'm glad I got to do it,
but nobody saw those.
You like it.

2050
02:12:25.891 --> 02:12:29.910
You said it was miserable.
Well,
no,
it wasn't.
No,
that wasn't miserable.

2051
02:12:29.911 --> 02:12:34.680
It was just you got one taping.
Oh my God,
we didn't get to tapings.

2052
02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:39.030
And then when it's your first big TV thing,
like now I know that,
oh,

2053
02:12:39.031 --> 02:12:42.420
I screwed that up.
I'll do it again.
And I just tape it again.

2054
02:12:42.630 --> 02:12:45.240
And I tell the audience like,
just don't worry,
I got this.

2055
02:12:45.270 --> 02:12:48.210
You'll laugh again cause I screwed up the words and it's fun.

2056
02:12:48.211 --> 02:12:51.030
And this was the first thing we,
everything's gotta be perfect.

2057
02:12:51.180 --> 02:12:54.810
But then you didn't know how to settle in to the crowd because they're taping.

2058
02:12:54.811 --> 02:12:58.590
It has to be,
everything has to be perfect and it just,
it's fucking nerve,
right?

2059
02:12:58.620 --> 02:13:00.720
Yeah.
It was more not knowing how to deal with it.
I,

2060
02:13:00.730 --> 02:13:04.670
that's why I thought we did it with full Ciaran.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2061
02:13:04.710 --> 02:13:08.670
Full Toronto is putting it in the booth and full Toronto was putting his own

2062
02:13:08.671 --> 02:13:11.970
commercial breaks into a special and it was one of the funniest things I've ever

2063
02:13:11.971 --> 02:13:14.720
seen because I'm there with the people that are in them,

2064
02:13:14.730 --> 02:13:17.910
like looking at the monitors,
everything.
And he would just finish a joke and go,

2065
02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.430
we'll be right back.
And they're sitting there going,

2066
02:13:20.431 --> 02:13:22.510
how does he know where we're going to

2067
02:13:24.710 --> 02:13:28.460
pause it goes and we're back anyway.
His diet,

2068
02:13:29.340 --> 02:13:32.220
he can't,
he doesn't know what we're going to put the had full

2069
02:13:32.230 --> 02:13:36.570
<v 14>charges.
That's still one of the funniest that tickles me the most.</v>

2070
02:13:37.140 --> 02:13:40.620
That will cause,
oh here's this,
here's a fart story in a comedy story.

2071
02:13:40.730 --> 02:13:45.660
So you're about,
um,
did you ever do the laugh riots contest?

2072
02:13:45.661 --> 02:13:50.130
You remember that early?
I didn't do them but I have variety.
It was,

2073
02:13:50.160 --> 02:13:54.230
it was like a regional standup competition that comedy central heads.

2074
02:13:54.231 --> 02:13:57.120
So like the Midwest would have one and then you'd submit and they'd get 10

2075
02:13:57.121 --> 02:14:00.660
people to do that.
Like the Chicago's agonies and the winner from that.

2076
02:14:00.661 --> 02:14:04.620
And then the winner from the Texas one,
they'd have 10 of them in the 10 winners.

2077
02:14:04.650 --> 02:14:07.830
The finalists would come to la for to do a show.

2078
02:14:08.100 --> 02:14:10.920
And I wanted in Chicago and I was already planning on moving to La.

2079
02:14:10.921 --> 02:14:13.680
But then when I went that regional thing,
I'm like well here I come show Biz.

2080
02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:17.320
You don't even buy me a plane ticket cause I'm moving there.
And I did.

2081
02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:22.440
And cause that you could get on premium blend.
That was,
that was the first step.

2082
02:14:22.441 --> 02:14:25.680
Remember before half hours for sure it was premium blends.

2083
02:14:25.980 --> 02:14:28.440
And they were saying the top three people,

2084
02:14:28.441 --> 02:14:32.880
top three winners of the laugh riots would get a premium blend spot.

2085
02:14:33.330 --> 02:14:36.600
Well,
I did so bad on that show.

2086
02:14:36.601 --> 02:14:40.830
I know I came in dead last because not only do the top three winners,

2087
02:14:41.010 --> 02:14:45.070
nine people got on.
Yeah,
unblend from that show except for me.

2088
02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:47.770
And I bombed so bad.
And then I got,

2089
02:14:47.771 --> 02:14:52.210
I just drank all the free drinks I could backstage until the venue closed down

2090
02:14:52.630 --> 02:14:56.380
and I had just moved to la like a week before and I didn't,
I was like,

2091
02:14:56.410 --> 02:15:00.600
my friends were at some bar and I was just alone at the key club on sunset strip

2092
02:15:00.890 --> 02:15:03.880
at some stage hands,
a lady stage hand.

2093
02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:08.050
But like overall it's like a real tough gal.
She's like,
I'll give you a ride.

2094
02:15:08.380 --> 02:15:13.120
And she had gotten around to civic and she stopped at a norms to buy coke first.

2095
02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:18.230
So,
so we're in [inaudible] we're always open norms.
Yes.
We never close.

2096
02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:23.320
We never close norms when Denny's is a little too fancy for Denny's but with

2097
02:15:23.651 --> 02:15:25.420
open to a lot of open toed sandals.

2098
02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:30.880
So we stopped with the norms parking lot to,
to buy coke and she like,

2099
02:15:31.020 --> 02:15:35.650
she was a bigger girl so she had to hoist herself up out of her civic to go to

2100
02:15:35.651 --> 02:15:40.300
the other car to buy drugs and she just beefed like just like demo rock for just

2101
02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:45.220
brown.
And I was,
I was already drunk and she just goes,
whoops.

2102
02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:49.780
Like no shame.
Just whoops.
And then shut the door.
Just hot.

2103
02:15:52.210 --> 02:15:57.210
The drunk failure like another end up sitting there just like in her stink.

2104
02:15:57.790 --> 02:16:02.380
Oh,
I've failure.
She got back in the car and gave me like a,
a seal,

2105
02:16:02.381 --> 02:16:06.130
like a folded up magazine pages.
I hear,
let's Party and I open it up.

2106
02:16:06.131 --> 02:16:08.560
It was still like a bunch of like big,
it wasn't cracked,

2107
02:16:08.561 --> 02:16:12.670
but it was like big rocks.
And I'm like,
shouldn't we chop this up?
She's like,

2108
02:16:12.671 --> 02:16:13.720
yeah,
if you're a pussy.

2109
02:16:13.721 --> 02:16:18.280
And so I just tried to snort these big chunks of coke and they just went up my

2110
02:16:18.281 --> 02:16:21.820
nose.
It fell out on my shirt and I was like,

2111
02:16:21.940 --> 02:16:25.010
I left my family and friends,
I left,

2112
02:16:25.830 --> 02:16:30.070
I left my loved ones to pursue this dream.
And it was like a week of being here.

2113
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:34.300
<v 11>I was like,
you're not gonna make it.
You're not cut out for this.</v>

2114
02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:37.330
And she dropped me off at the bar and my friends were at the front.
They're like,

2115
02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:38.890
Kyle,
I'm like not now.

2116
02:16:38.891 --> 02:16:43.120
And I ran in the bathroom cause then she came in looking for me like fuck,

2117
02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:46.830
<v 14>like the,
like the,
the,
what was the,</v>

2118
02:16:46.831 --> 02:16:49.980
was that the big foot that was putting like I'm going to put your little ears

2119
02:16:51.700 --> 02:16:53.400
<v 11>came stopping and looking for me.</v>

2120
02:16:54.350 --> 02:16:56.330
<v 14>When you bombed that w did you know,</v>

2121
02:16:56.370 --> 02:17:00.110
was it like out of the gate bomb where he like opened and you're like,
ah shit.

2122
02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:04.020
Yeah cause it was,
it was like,
it,

2123
02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:08.210
like Jamie Kennedy hosted it and he was drunk before the show even started.

2124
02:17:08.211 --> 02:17:13.211
So he was like screwing up people's names and then like the p like you could

2125
02:17:13.461 --> 02:17:17.600
tell who the favorite,
like the intown favorite was.
And again,

2126
02:17:17.601 --> 02:17:21.290
I get in my head before I ever do a set and you could tell the crowd was kind of

2127
02:17:21.830 --> 02:17:25.250
checking out already,
like talking to each other and I'm like,
here's my pro.

2128
02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:27.170
I didn't know how to hang out.
I was just like,

2129
02:17:27.171 --> 02:17:30.610
here's the bits that got me here and I'm going to say them how old they're

2130
02:17:30.630 --> 02:17:35.120
supposed to be said with no finesse or like relaxing into it and it was just

2131
02:17:35.121 --> 02:17:38.760
like,
I'm there and I'm done.
Okay,
well yeah.

2132
02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:42.620
<v 11>Yeah.
Painful.
At least you got a premium blend I think.
No,
I never got,</v>

2133
02:17:42.870 --> 02:17:46.680
I didn't get it.
Sorry.
Yeah,
I got the laugh riots part.

2134
02:17:46.681 --> 02:17:49.170
That's what I got filmed.
Less horrible.

2135
02:17:49.530 --> 02:17:52.260
I'm just realizing Kyle is that I have known you for a million years,

2136
02:17:52.261 --> 02:17:55.380
but I've never seen you in daylight.
Like you're one of these people.

2137
02:17:55.381 --> 02:17:56.850
I've only ever seen

2138
02:18:05.150 --> 02:18:07.710
the light of day,

2139
02:18:14.380 --> 02:18:15.450
afternoon nap.

2140
02:18:18.900 --> 02:18:21.870
Voice doesn't make me sound like I'm living.
Well,

2141
02:18:25.210 --> 02:18:28.100
<v 14>all messages sent to me where they're like,</v>

2142
02:18:28.700 --> 02:18:30.950
it's so weird to get like on Twitter or there'll be like,

2143
02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:35.150
do you look like you should have Kyle kinane is voice not your shitty voice?

2144
02:18:35.630 --> 02:18:37.760
Cool.
Thanks man,
isn't it?
Isn't it

2145
02:18:37.900 --> 02:18:41.520
<v 11>so fun?
We'll be like,
your voice sucks.
You should have is his voice.</v>

2146
02:18:41.620 --> 02:18:41.801
<v 14>Well,</v>

2147
02:18:41.801 --> 02:18:46.300
I don't know how like I'm not built for it like you guys and all the fat jokes

2148
02:18:46.301 --> 02:18:49.570
and I've just opened the world of inside jokes up to everyone.

2149
02:18:50.110 --> 02:18:54.040
I don't like any of that stuff.
When somebody like,
I'll shave my beard,

2150
02:18:54.041 --> 02:18:55.780
like this is pretty short,
but I'll shave it off.

2151
02:18:56.230 --> 02:18:58.780
And so many people just strangers or like,
hey,

2152
02:18:58.781 --> 02:19:00.470
you know how you normally have a beard?
Yeah,

2153
02:19:00.500 --> 02:19:04.900
you should grow that back right away.
I'm like,
just tell me my face is ugly.

2154
02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:08.880
That's what you're saying.
I sent you a picture of my face.
Exactly.
Yeah.

2155
02:19:09.130 --> 02:19:12.970
And I know what it looks like.
Yeah.
But the fact that people just like,
Hey,

2156
02:19:12.971 --> 02:19:16.500
your face,
it's bad.
So now I feel bad for him.
You should cover.

2157
02:19:16.501 --> 02:19:19.750
He's just trying to have fun though,
you know.
But you're a friend.
Okay.

2158
02:19:19.780 --> 02:19:23.740
This is just,
I'm saying strangers show the other night and somebody just,

2159
02:19:23.741 --> 02:19:28.010
cause I had worked with Burt before,
like minute bursts,
fat.
My man,
I'm

2160
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:29.450
<v 11>not part of that shit.
I Dunno.</v>

2161
02:19:32.110 --> 02:19:36.640
<v 13>I'm not part,
we're all fat now.
He is,
but he's the best.</v>

2162
02:19:36.641 --> 02:19:39.960
He's the most racist,
racist.
Oh phew.

2163
02:19:39.980 --> 02:19:44.680
And believe it's a fun Bert.
Fun.
Burt dropping f bombs.
Fun Bird of the claim.

2164
02:19:45.730 --> 02:19:50.310
Or you get a sound bite?
I do.
I have it somewhere.
Oh yeah,

2165
02:19:50.500 --> 02:19:53.620
Bert dropping stuff.
Oh yeah.
Oh my gosh.

2166
02:19:53.621 --> 02:19:57.160
I didn't realize we had footage from his latest special you to record before

2167
02:19:57.161 --> 02:20:00.250
this starts going.
No,
no,
no,
no.
Got All this black male shit on me.

2168
02:20:00.251 --> 02:20:01.400
I said before we start,

2169
02:20:01.660 --> 02:20:03.250
<v 11>that would have been,
by the way,</v>

2170
02:20:10.970 --> 02:20:15.840
<v 13>Kyle,
can you know the r word,
the n word,
the c word.
Well,</v>

2171
02:20:15.841 --> 02:20:20.030
I can't find it right
in front of it.
I'll say it.

2172
02:20:20.730 --> 02:20:24.750
I wonder if it's on the master list.
Is the bird thing on there?

2173
02:20:25.470 --> 02:20:30.390
Do you know if that's on there?
Uh,
he says he doesn't think so.
Oh,
of course not.

2174
02:20:31.140 --> 02:20:36.000
Let's see.
Let's see that.
No,
I don't have it.
Okay,

2175
02:20:36.100 --> 02:20:40.500
<v 11>well,
well,
what were you gonna say?
Third is the most racist track comedian.</v>

2176
02:20:40.890 --> 02:20:45.750
<v 13>Oh,
there he is right there.
Just admitting to it.
Yeah.</v>

2177
02:20:46.030 --> 02:20:48.690
Yeah,
I have him saying something super racist,

2178
02:20:49.410 --> 02:20:53.420
but he was on our show like knowingly saying it,
remember?
Oh really?

2179
02:20:53.930 --> 02:20:57.510
Yeah.
Well there was that time he would,
he set that Asian family on fire,

2180
02:20:57.511 --> 02:20:59.310
but there was a time that he,
uh,

2181
02:21:00.660 --> 02:21:05.280
I forget anyways.
Um,
I'll find it,
I'll find it at some point.

2182
02:21:06.110 --> 02:21:08.190
But anyway,
yeah,
it was never part of that whole see,

2183
02:21:08.191 --> 02:21:11.070
but people just tell me like,
you're a comedian,
Burt's fat.
I'm like,

2184
02:21:11.071 --> 02:21:13.530
all right man.
Yeah,
I guess,

2185
02:21:14.050 --> 02:21:18.900
but if you had it going with you and like one of your close friends and you guys

2186
02:21:18.901 --> 02:21:20.970
were endorsing it,
you know,
then people

2187
02:21:23.810 --> 02:21:27.160
<v 11>shaved my face and my friend's like,
man,
your face is fucking terrible.
I'm like,</v>

2188
02:21:27.161 --> 02:21:30.200
hi,
you're my friend.
But like a strangers like your face is ugly.
No,

2189
02:21:30.390 --> 02:21:31.690
it's drop dead.

2190
02:21:33.640 --> 02:21:35.550
Bury yourself and take your mother with

2191
02:21:40.710 --> 02:21:42.090
those east coast radio guys.

2192
02:21:47.940 --> 02:21:50.230
Guys came up as well.
Some other comics

2193
02:21:52.870 --> 02:21:55.930
glasses guy with glasses.
What are you the guys with glasses crew?

2194
02:21:56.950 --> 02:21:58.960
You must be a New York comic

2195
02:22:03.040 --> 02:22:07.050
mango.
These guys can't get enough of that kind of insight.

2196
02:22:08.160 --> 02:22:09.940
That makes me so nervous.

2197
02:22:10.480 --> 02:22:13.570
I get very uncomfortable listening to those kinds of shows.

2198
02:22:15.550 --> 02:22:19.720
For me,
I don't listen to any podcasts about comedy.

2199
02:22:20.860 --> 02:22:24.760
<v 13>Oh wait,
I don't want to lie.
I don't let it come into,</v>

2200
02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:29.310
<v 14>I want to keep myself pier and watch any comedy.</v>

2201
02:22:29.311 --> 02:22:34.260
I'm amazed when someone was like watching comedies drop in on like like new

2202
02:22:34.261 --> 02:22:36.510
special,
but then I'm watching it just to hate it and I'm like,

2203
02:22:36.511 --> 02:22:39.940
that's not the way to go about it is how it is.
Right?
Yeah.
I watch sky.

2204
02:22:40.070 --> 02:22:44.390
I been watching the Americans.
I don't watch it.
That right.
That's my point.

2205
02:22:44.400 --> 02:22:45.480
Funny at all.
No,

2206
02:22:45.481 --> 02:22:48.060
but when you're a comic though and you're around this all day and you're writing

2207
02:22:48.061 --> 02:22:51.220
and you're performing,
you're seeing it.
You want to be entertained.

2208
02:22:51.530 --> 02:22:53.160
I knew the other side.
Yeah.

2209
02:22:53.290 --> 02:22:56.340
The same reason people are at comedy shows because their lives are boring or

2210
02:22:56.341 --> 02:23:00.030
traumatic all the time,
but you need to laugh.
Right.
I'm like,
I've left plenty.

2211
02:23:00.110 --> 02:23:03.090
Yeah.
I need some real dry meetings.
I need something to make me cringe.

2212
02:23:03.570 --> 02:23:07.080
<v 2>Same way I need to drop into somebody's real life that has like connected</v>

2213
02:23:07.081 --> 02:23:08.340
relationships,
sir.

2214
02:23:10.090 --> 02:23:13.150
<v 13>You just come home at 5:00 PM and have a meal.</v>

2215
02:23:14.440 --> 02:23:18.010
You don't try and squelch the boredom with drugs or alcohol.

2216
02:23:19.390 --> 02:23:21.820
See a therapist twice a week.
I do have,

2217
02:23:22.220 --> 02:23:25.500
<v 14>my friends are,
I'm Mike.
So you just go to bed at 10 yeah.
Bed.</v>

2218
02:23:26.210 --> 02:23:29.480
You wake up and do shit in the morning time.
Yeah.
Even Rachel,

2219
02:23:29.550 --> 02:23:31.340
my girlfriend's like up.
I'm like,
wow.
All right,

2220
02:23:31.400 --> 02:23:34.820
well good luck with this part of the day.
Yeah,
well you at noon.

2221
02:23:34.890 --> 02:23:38.280
<v 2>We used to sleep in until noon and then we had children and now like I'm up at</v>

2222
02:23:38.281 --> 02:23:40.320
6:00 AM every day.
It's brutal.

2223
02:23:40.321 --> 02:23:44.160
Like it took three years for me to get used to that schedule because my normal

2224
02:23:44.161 --> 02:23:48.000
is nocturnal.
He and I used to be up till two three in the morning and then,
yeah.

2225
02:23:48.190 --> 02:23:51.210
<v 14>But I don't want to,
every fucking shit's over.</v>

2226
02:23:51.211 --> 02:23:54.780
You ever live your lives now and knowing that your kids could go through the

2227
02:23:54.781 --> 02:23:57.660
archives?
It's not an,
it's not a good thing to think about.

2228
02:24:00.500 --> 02:24:03.540
And it's definitely got a library.

2229
02:24:04.370 --> 02:24:08.340
Like I really wonder if like kids that can be like,
and not to pile on the Louis,

2230
02:24:08.400 --> 02:24:11.430
they budget budgeted.
Look,
my kids are assholes and like you laugh at it.

2231
02:24:11.431 --> 02:24:16.200
But then eventually those kids would be like,
he call us assholes to strangers.

2232
02:24:16.860 --> 02:24:19.320
I,
I do,
I do jokes about my folks.
I don't think their main,

2233
02:24:19.321 --> 02:24:22.170
but even after the show I have to ask my parents like,
it wasn't mean was it?

2234
02:24:22.460 --> 02:24:26.460
Yeah.
Oh,
I'm doing,
I'm,
I'm at this point now where I'm like,
Hey,
mom,

2235
02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:31.530
uh,
is really mean.
Well really?
Yeah.
And I'm like,

2236
02:24:31.531 --> 02:24:35.280
it's really mean,
but like,
it's helping your son,
you know,
and,

2237
02:24:35.290 --> 02:24:38.750
and provide for his family.
And she's like,
do you,

2238
02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:42.690
do you do that from the Bluetooth in your Blue Porsche?

2239
02:24:45.690 --> 02:24:50.520
<v 13>Put food on the table.
Hold on.
I got down shift.
That's going be noisy.</v>

2240
02:24:52.440 --> 02:24:57.300
Open it up in this car.
Pool Lane.
Accurate.

2241
02:24:58.030 --> 02:24:59.640
I can't to,
I won't tell my Bob

2242
02:24:59.700 --> 02:25:03.060
<v 14>like how much I make or anything,
but she,
she's always asking me like,
how,</v>

2243
02:25:03.110 --> 02:25:06.300
but how was,
how are your bills?
I'm like,
I'm fine.

2244
02:25:06.330 --> 02:25:11.310
I know it doesn't make sense that I tell jokes and I'm fine,
but you know,

2245
02:25:11.650 --> 02:25:15.130
but the mean stuff,
I'm like,
look at how much everybody else left.

2246
02:25:16.330 --> 02:25:16.840
My family

2247
02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:20.440
<v 2>is so dysfunctional that I actually do have family members that won't speak to</v>

2248
02:25:20.441 --> 02:25:24.220
me because of stuff that I've set on this show or am I act oh

2249
02:25:24.220 --> 02:25:28.090
<v 13>yeah.
And it's kind of a favor.
It's a blessing in disguise.</v>

2250
02:25:29.490 --> 02:25:32.260
Face time with my mom and show her cash.

2251
02:25:34.150 --> 02:25:37.870
You're like a rapper.
Yeah.
Yes.
And then she would hold it on your muscles.

2252
02:25:38.550 --> 02:25:41.340
It's not how you hold money.
Like I got another phone call,
hold on.

2253
02:25:43.580 --> 02:25:47.570
And then I'll send her a gift and she'll be like,
Ooh,
like what is this?

2254
02:25:47.810 --> 02:25:52.460
And it will be a mug with her face asleep in a picture on the mug.
She looks,

2255
02:25:52.461 --> 02:25:55.190
she looks dead.
We just made those.

2256
02:25:56.160 --> 02:26:00.870
She appreciate those gifts.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I always cry.

2257
02:26:01.270 --> 02:26:05.960
Oh,
I don't want to make my mom cry.
Do you like your mom?
Yeah,

2258
02:26:05.961 --> 02:26:07.910
I mean I've argued with him,
but I like my parents.

2259
02:26:08.270 --> 02:26:11.120
My thing every year is every mother's Day I sent her flowers,

2260
02:26:11.121 --> 02:26:15.740
but the message only because I know the florist has to handwrite the message.

2261
02:26:16.280 --> 02:26:18.530
Like sometimes I do like hostage notes.

2262
02:26:19.570 --> 02:26:23.450
I've done like threats that's threatened her through it.

2263
02:26:24.440 --> 02:26:28.040
I'd be like,
me meet me with the money at the docks,
like to call it shit.

2264
02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:32.210
Just cause I know a stranger has to write that up in Dallas and she loves it.

2265
02:26:32.211 --> 02:26:33.050
Every year.
She's like,

2266
02:26:33.051 --> 02:26:35.930
I'm looking forward to mother's Day and I'm running out of ideas.

2267
02:26:35.931 --> 02:26:38.900
I'll just do a pick a language to put it in there.
That's really funny.

2268
02:26:39.020 --> 02:26:44.020
What about Valentine's Day?
Did you send her?
Does your mommy,
your valentines?

2269
02:26:45.230 --> 02:26:49.310
I talked to her today.
She said she,
she does send me Valentine's if I would live,

2270
02:26:49.370 --> 02:26:52.910
if I was in Chicago still I would still have to look for Easter basket.

2271
02:26:53.420 --> 02:26:57.590
She loves the holidays.
That's sweet.
She's a big fan.
She's a fun lady.
No,

2272
02:26:57.591 --> 02:27:01.250
that's nice.
I mean,
my mom's,
my mom was pretty nice,
but we always,

2273
02:27:01.700 --> 02:27:06.590
we've fucked with each other our whole life.
So I'm used to,
my mom was a bitch,

2274
02:27:06.591 --> 02:27:11.020
but she's dead.
Oh yeah.
Well that's,
well,
two out of three,
right guys?

2275
02:27:12.230 --> 02:27:15.840
Two out of three a.
We love our moms.
You know,

2276
02:27:16.510 --> 02:27:21.290
Christina's is a,
she was bad and she's done,
so.
Okay.
All right.
Hey,
okay,
cool.

2277
02:27:22.300 --> 02:27:25.220
6% motherly love comic guys.

2278
02:27:28.450 --> 02:27:33.130
Where's that come from?
That was
wow.

2279
02:27:35.110 --> 02:27:36.240
Dot.
Come back.

2280
02:27:40.490 --> 02:27:42.480
How's everybody else's career ruined?

2281
02:27:42.481 --> 02:27:44.850
And you have a studio for a podcast that would,

2282
02:27:44.851 --> 02:27:49.851
that kind of bullshit my shots world toward it's on sale now.

2283
02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:55.710
Go see Burton checkout.
Are you guys there?
He got a bookcase.

2284
02:27:56.390 --> 02:28:01.340
Kinda Shanana.
It's a really crazy actually.
Um,

2285
02:28:01.810 --> 02:28:05.060
ah,
what did I have for you?
Oh,
you know what I found?
I couldn't find a course.

2286
02:28:05.061 --> 02:28:09.770
I can never find anything.
But I found,
remember we had big daddy Kane on.

2287
02:28:09.910 --> 02:28:13.640
Yeah.
And I was trying to tell him what is it?
Is it,
um,

2288
02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:15.440
in my asshole smells.

2289
02:28:15.890 --> 02:28:20.360
Have Jesus Christ pages to your girlfriend?
Yes.

2290
02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:23.750
Hold Mail.
How serious right now are you dating?

2291
02:28:24.190 --> 02:28:28.340
You were in a serious relationship committed.
She,
she's not a comedian.
No.

2292
02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:34.700
So she's a adjacent to the world.
Do you demand that she eats your scrum,

2293
02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:39.530
licks,
your scrum,
scrum or later,
have you ever asked for that?

2294
02:28:39.530 --> 02:28:42.620
Which parts of the scrum?
It's basically,
you're like you're raising cake,

2295
02:28:42.621 --> 02:28:45.720
you know,
look,
we're the,
we're the Duke he comes out of,

2296
02:28:46.370 --> 02:28:49.610
that's the reason cake I think so.
Sacred your balls.

2297
02:28:49.611 --> 02:28:52.650
We'll be raising kick cause they look raise in and they're like a little loaf.

2298
02:28:52.850 --> 02:28:56.340
I mean,
I'm up for the argument.
I think that's it.

2299
02:28:56.341 --> 02:29:01.280
And I thought I've stated you stated yours.
I mean,
no,
I don't need it.

2300
02:29:01.460 --> 02:29:04.960
Yeah,
I'll,
I'll,
I'll dish it out,
but I don't need it.
I don't know.

2301
02:29:05.410 --> 02:29:09.890
I never want like she'll send me,

2302
02:29:10.220 --> 02:29:13.360
you seem like a guy that would demand it but keep going.
No.

2303
02:29:13.670 --> 02:29:14.451
Well that's the thing.

2304
02:29:14.451 --> 02:29:18.590
Like she'll send me Dick pics in there of my deck while I'm asleep and I never

2305
02:29:18.591 --> 02:29:23.360
wanted to see my body from that angle.
I've never wanted to see my,

2306
02:29:23.860 --> 02:29:28.140
my Dick and balls from the feet up.
Yeah.

2307
02:29:28.430 --> 02:29:31.850
That was like,
not only is it,
why not find it attractive?
What,
how,

2308
02:29:31.851 --> 02:29:34.460
what's wrong with you?
I'm glad,

2309
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:39.790
but the fact that I would even have to know what my butthole would be like.

2310
02:29:41.410 --> 02:29:45.620
Ah,
right.
And plus your browns are messy or vegetarian?

2311
02:29:46.130 --> 02:29:48.260
No,
I'm pretty,
I'm pretty decent about that.

2312
02:29:49.100 --> 02:29:54.040
Sometimes comes out real clean after no squatty potty.
Squatty potty.

2313
02:29:54.050 --> 02:29:56.270
Just opening it up.
Your system pretty.
Are you pretty regular?

2314
02:29:57.130 --> 02:30:00.440
I Dunno what's regular,
you know what I mean?
Like once a day are you like,

2315
02:30:00.740 --> 02:30:04.970
what is it like twice a day?
Why is it the same time every morning kind of thing?

2316
02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:09.360
If I throw some coffee in there?
Yeah,
coffee I do.

2317
02:30:09.790 --> 02:30:13.640
I scare my girlfriend first because I would do this thing called like a Tongan

2318
02:30:13.640 --> 02:30:16.430
Death March when I'm just kind of slapping my stomach,
which is like,

2319
02:30:16.431 --> 02:30:17.270
what's going on?
I'm like,

2320
02:30:17.271 --> 02:30:22.271
I'm drumming up business and like truly thought that I was like getting it all

2321
02:30:23.551 --> 02:30:28.551
to fucking burger king down or been burger time down into the right position.

2322
02:30:29.510 --> 02:30:34.250
Oh,
yeah.
Yeah,
I'll do that.
I go camping a lot of like shitting outside you guys.

2323
02:30:34.251 --> 02:30:36.670
Yeah.
You guys talk about shit all the time.
Ever.
Shit outside.

2324
02:30:37.380 --> 02:30:40.290
You have a house with a yard now.
You can just do that.
I pee in the backyard.

2325
02:30:40.310 --> 02:30:44.060
Sometimes the people in the yard I peed in the back yard a few times.

2326
02:30:44.230 --> 02:30:49.230
I believe it or it did do it too because of a reason or just because we were

2327
02:30:50.181 --> 02:30:53.000
drinking in the back yard.
Well then yeah.
Yeah,

2328
02:30:54.020 --> 02:30:57.230
but I mean I'll do like dig a hole and will you do that in your own yard though?

2329
02:30:57.350 --> 02:30:59.720
I don't have a yard.
I live in an apartment,
but I mean if you had a yard,

2330
02:31:00.110 --> 02:31:04.250
go to the park.
The park or to the dog park.
Yeah,

2331
02:31:04.600 --> 02:31:06.290
that was my camping or something.
I'll go,

2332
02:31:06.760 --> 02:31:10.880
I'll do lab like mountain biking up in the woods and there.
All right,

2333
02:31:10.910 --> 02:31:12.320
we've got to do this here.
Yeah,

2334
02:31:12.440 --> 02:31:16.370
we've got to handle this business and you dig a hole and you and you squat in

2335
02:31:16.371 --> 02:31:20.010
the proper way that you should be.
That's the way,
the way you're supposed to do

2336
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:23.880
<v 2>it.
It feels like Turkish toilets or whatever,
like,
oh,
how could you do that?</v>

2337
02:31:23.881 --> 02:31:27.510
But that's the best way.
That's how I,
yeah,
that's a way it opens it up.
Yeah,

2338
02:31:27.511 --> 02:31:31.320
I know.
So can you,
so she's,
but can you be yourself with our,
I guess,

2339
02:31:31.321 --> 02:31:34.270
I guess I don't understand how people,
like if you're not married,
a comedian,

2340
02:31:34.271 --> 02:31:37.350
like I just say what I want to him and were horrible to each other.

2341
02:31:37.820 --> 02:31:42.280
<v 0>Yeah.
But I also don't get to censor yourself sometime.
No,</v>

2342
02:31:42.290 --> 02:31:45.630
because that's not something I would talk about,
like my scrum.
That wouldn't,
it.

2343
02:31:45.940 --> 02:31:48.650
<v 2>You're not,
you're not into that kind of dialogue with her.</v>

2344
02:31:48.740 --> 02:31:52.640
You said that was so much to stand.
It's disgusting.
Right.
Kind of blessing.
He,

2345
02:31:52.700 --> 02:31:56.090
that's what he says to me all the time.
Built an empire on this.

2346
02:31:57.070 --> 02:32:01.190
But I'm mystified by that.
Yeah.
I mean,

2347
02:32:08.790 --> 02:32:11.690
<v 12>yes,
laugh at it.
It's fucking ridiculous.</v>

2348
02:32:12.110 --> 02:32:16.580
This is the studio that part's made.
You got to see this other car,

2349
02:32:18.340 --> 02:32:21.510
but,
but here,
let me just ask you this,
does this or something

2350
02:32:21.620 --> 02:32:26.240
<v 2>you would do to your lady last night?
Tom Goes,
he like,
he,</v>

2351
02:32:26.241 --> 02:32:28.490
he'll go make a brown,
he'll come back and he'll be like,

2352
02:32:28.491 --> 02:32:30.630
I have a great story for you.
I'd be like,
what?
He's like,
yeah,

2353
02:32:30.700 --> 02:32:35.090
he sat down and then I made a brown and then I flushed and I'm like,

2354
02:32:35.091 --> 02:32:38.570
that's not even a real story.
But he's,
he's always telling me nasty shit.

2355
02:32:38.600 --> 02:32:40.130
Are you nasty like that with your lady?

2356
02:32:40.240 --> 02:32:44.290
<v 0>No.
Yeah.
I want to preserve.
Right.
So</v>

2357
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:47.580
<v 2>you see her as a woman still?
Yeah.</v>

2358
02:32:47.890 --> 02:32:52.010
Somebody sexually viable.
Yeah.
Yes.
She's a whole lady to me.

2359
02:32:52.690 --> 02:32:56.500
Yeah.
I'm not trying to cause a rift come here to start me.

2360
02:32:56.540 --> 02:33:00.200
It's been like this for 14 years.
So.
Well,
and what are you getting upset?

2361
02:33:00.530 --> 02:33:03.830
<v 12>There you go.
Oh,
I did by the way.</v>

2362
02:33:04.570 --> 02:33:08.860
<v 2>14 years and now you're bringing it up,
bringing it up for the whole time.</v>

2363
02:33:09.520 --> 02:33:09.940
Yesterday

2364
02:33:09.940 --> 02:33:11.110
<v 0>I told her pretty cool story.</v>

2365
02:33:11.111 --> 02:33:14.980
She made it sound like it was like really juvenile and they'd run it by me.

2366
02:33:15.050 --> 02:33:19.480
So I was in Reno and I was uh,
I was supposed to a good start.
Yeah.

2367
02:33:19.510 --> 02:33:24.510
I was supposed to take a ride back on the bus after the show Saturday night and

2368
02:33:25.960 --> 02:33:27.760
there was snow storms like you're flying out.

2369
02:33:27.761 --> 02:33:32.680
So I spend the night and I'm like kind of bummed about that bus tour bus.

2370
02:33:32.860 --> 02:33:36.230
So it had,
I had a tour bus take me.
Oh,
it was great.
I was like,
hell,

2371
02:33:36.690 --> 02:33:39.550
I thought you're doing well in my head.
I'm like,
Oh hey greyhound,

2372
02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:43.780
I still take that sounds so excited because the idea of the whole plan was

2373
02:33:43.840 --> 02:33:48.520
finished the show Saturday night and immediately get on a bus,
go to bed,

2374
02:33:48.820 --> 02:33:52.630
wake up at home.
I was like,
that's kind of the train.
Yeah.
So anyways,

2375
02:33:52.631 --> 02:33:54.700
they let me know like,
ah,
we can't do it anymore.

2376
02:33:54.850 --> 02:33:57.280
So you've got to fly out of Reno in the morning.
So I spend the night,

2377
02:33:57.281 --> 02:34:01.510
they're not happy about it.
Get up early,
get to the airport.

2378
02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:05.710
And I,
I was with,
uh,
Josh Potter.
I go,
Hey,

2379
02:34:05.740 --> 02:34:10.200
hold my bags and I,
you know,
which is the,
I was one of the best by the way.

2380
02:34:10.270 --> 02:34:13.290
Advantages of traveling with friends.
Yeah.
Was like you have to bring your bags.

2381
02:34:13.720 --> 02:34:16.420
That must be leaving the bags with somebody,
you know,

2382
02:34:16.850 --> 02:34:18.880
bowels free and clear

2383
02:34:19.130 --> 02:34:22.720
<v 11>bathroom that you're caring about.
Decorating your closet.</v>

2384
02:34:23.830 --> 02:34:25.150
I fucking hate that part.

2385
02:34:25.630 --> 02:34:28.480
And then I don't want to put stuff on the ground because you see peas.
I'm like,

2386
02:34:28.980 --> 02:34:33.310
I'm watching the coat hook bend with the weight of my and men's rooms.

2387
02:34:33.800 --> 02:34:38.230
Rosis there.
Of course.
I mean there's so filthy,
so I just go in

2388
02:34:38.340 --> 02:34:41.940
<v 0>there and I got,
my handle is anyways,</v>

2389
02:34:42.060 --> 02:34:45.900
I just let out a couple of crazy far,
nothing else comes out.

2390
02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:50.670
I get home,
right?
I fly,
I get home,
they,
the story gets more,

2391
02:34:50.890 --> 02:34:55.890
it gets better and then I go home and I am ready for now.

2392
02:34:56.101 --> 02:35:00.660
It's been a couple of hours.
I get home,
I sit down,
a couple other huge farts.

2393
02:35:01.300 --> 02:35:04.500
Then I fart in the kitchen and you're like,
hey,
take it easy.

2394
02:35:04.680 --> 02:35:08.910
There's people walking around.
We had a nanny helping us out and then,

2395
02:35:09.870 --> 02:35:13.530
and then,
uh,
and then I shit later.
And then that's the whole story.

2396
02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:17.020
<v 11>Do you talk like this Tier Laney?
I don't think she'd be interested.</v>

2397
02:35:17.200 --> 02:35:20.740
I wasn't either.
I think it's a pretty good story.

2398
02:35:21.190 --> 02:35:26.190
I think anybody that does not match the Reno start made itself in Reno.

2399
02:35:27.610 --> 02:35:31.680
Yeah.
Well maybe you guys aren't up on a storytelling,
but anyways,
um,
there's a

2400
02:35:33.160 --> 02:35:37.630
<v 0>couple emails,
um,
people wrote in,
let's see here.</v>

2401
02:35:38.140 --> 02:35:39.460
Oh,
this was like,
um,

2402
02:35:39.700 --> 02:35:44.700
I guess we discussed this on the last thing about our pronouns that um,

2403
02:35:45.930 --> 02:35:50.610
<v 11>yeah,
Starbucks has a pronoun pins for the employees to wear him.</v>

2404
02:35:50.611 --> 02:35:52.890
Hers,
them,
they,
you know,

2405
02:35:52.910 --> 02:35:57.120
you're up on your end of the day because that's plural.
Well,

2406
02:35:57.850 --> 02:36:01.440
[inaudible] got introduced as day and I'm like,
ah,

2407
02:36:01.610 --> 02:36:06.000
<v 0>like a dual act and an interesting one po,
it was more of a grammar thing.</v>

2408
02:36:06.001 --> 02:36:10.740
I have a kid now.
Did the person make the distinction to be introduced as day?
Oh,

2409
02:36:10.741 --> 02:36:15.210
it was.
Okay.
So they said like bringing,
yeah.
All right,

2410
02:36:15.480 --> 02:36:20.310
well I'm wondering if maybe I'm poly and by pins aren't far behind.

2411
02:36:20.311 --> 02:36:24.220
And then this person wrote,
burp,
Burp,
shy.
Zur is fat.
Okay.

2412
02:36:25.140 --> 02:36:28.020
Wow.
All right.
That's it.
That just keeps,

2413
02:36:29.160 --> 02:36:31.980
<v 11>you wouldn't believe how much people love that shaming Bert.</v>

2414
02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:35.610
It's really taken us shame if it doesn't care.

2415
02:36:36.270 --> 02:36:40.090
So good point.
That's a good point.
Who's that?

2416
02:36:40.290 --> 02:36:44.160
And he kind of enjoys the attention a little.
Yeah.
That it's not,
it's just fat.

2417
02:36:44.240 --> 02:36:47.900
A recognition.
That's true fat.
Yes.

2418
02:36:48.610 --> 02:36:52.380
No shame there.
I like this angle.
Thank you.
What's Your Pronoun?

2419
02:36:53.790 --> 02:36:57.610
What's Your Pronoun?
What are you going by these days,
Kyle?
Oh yeah.

2420

You're him.
Yeah,</v>

2421
02:37:02.650 --> 02:37:07.150

oh,
it must be interesting to hear at Kyle's take on this because this is in

2422
02:37:07.151 --> 02:37:10.840
response to an earlier episode of Said,
Hey,
what's good?
So this bitch,
I work,

2423
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:20.300
<v 13>that's another fun thing on our show.
So this bitch</v>

2424
02:37:20.690 --> 02:37:25.330
<v 0>with poorly whistles old macdonald,
every single mother fucking day.</v>

2425
02:37:26.060 --> 02:37:30.890
I had a vision punching her as hard as I can in the chest.
She also does,

2426
02:37:31.310 --> 02:37:36.070
she also does,
it says absurd shit.
You know how people said,
yeah,
uh,

2427
02:37:36.170 --> 02:37:38.810
say Shit.
If they make a mistake or something of that nature,

2428
02:37:38.990 --> 02:37:43.990
she will say cats are junkies to top it off and have boy to top it off,

2429
02:37:45.980 --> 02:37:48.950
she looks like an identical to Dwight Schrute from the office.

2430
02:37:48.980 --> 02:37:51.530
And that is from Nathan.
We were just talking about,
you know,

2431
02:37:51.560 --> 02:37:55.850
I think it's this kind of power,
power trip,
passive aggressive thing when you're,

2432
02:37:56.210 --> 02:37:56.450
you know,

2433
02:37:56.450 --> 02:38:00.250
maybe waiting in line at a coffee shop or somewhere and then there's some guy,

2434
02:38:00.870 --> 02:38:01.450
huh?

2435
02:38:01.450 --> 02:38:05.020
<v 13>No public whistler Whistler's the word and it's the only thing that the better</v>

2436
02:38:05.021 --> 02:38:08.920
you are at it,
the more obnoxious it is.
You want somebody to be like,

2437
02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:12.190
look how good I can whistle I hood rat.

2438
02:38:12.490 --> 02:38:17.320
I W I think now that the retaliation has to just shittily whistle something else

2439
02:38:17.321 --> 02:38:21.430
with that person and shit like chime in or just if somebody is whistling good

2440
02:38:21.431 --> 02:38:25.990
and you're like,
yeah,
I got you man.
You Buddy.

2441
02:38:26.140 --> 02:38:30.040
Yeah.
Pick a key.
All right.
Yeah,
no,

2442
02:38:30.041 --> 02:38:33.520
I agree that a public whistling a should be forbidden.

2443
02:38:33.630 --> 02:38:35.420
<v 0>Yeah.
It was in the,
or even like,
you know,
it was,</v>

2444
02:38:35.680 --> 02:38:38.880
it was in a gym locker room and it's like you're just,

2445
02:38:38.970 --> 02:38:41.550
obviously you're winding down,
you're going to get cleaned up.

2446
02:38:41.551 --> 02:38:45.530
And then there's a guy,
you know,
there's only like two or three of us in the,

2447
02:38:45.531 --> 02:38:49.890
in the locker room and he's just like a whistling the whole way through,

2448
02:38:50.010 --> 02:38:53.520
whistling to the shower,
whistling on the way back.
It's like,
all right man.

2449
02:38:53.580 --> 02:38:57.390
I think we all get it.
I try to be pretty tolerant of a lot of things will pug,

2450
02:38:57.420 --> 02:38:59.950
but that one's a tro,
shy won't.
Yeah,

2451
02:39:00.430 --> 02:39:04.900
<v 13>it does.
I mean,
I don't know if this guy should a punch her in the chest,</v>

2452
02:39:04.901 --> 02:39:08.700
but that's probably,
you know,
I see.
I understand is rich.
Yeah.

2453
02:39:09.490 --> 02:39:13.310
I want you also seems like he's got some other issues.
Wow.
That's

2454
02:39:14.170 --> 02:39:17.320
<v 2>uh,
I think it was gene Pompa,
was it?
Or taught now?
Sorry.</v>

2455
02:39:17.321 --> 02:39:22.321
Tom Papa on his Instagram the other day had a video of a guy,

2456
02:39:22.571 --> 02:39:26.920
a full grown man playing a video game at full volume on an airplane.

2457
02:39:27.460 --> 02:39:31.510
Like just how the iPad out at full volume.
Boop,
boop,
beep,
boop up like,

2458
02:39:31.540 --> 02:39:35.000
oh my fucking God,
what?
Yeah,

2459
02:39:35.520 --> 02:39:38.640
<v 13>that's horrible.
I need ear about what to do.
Say stuff.
Yeah.</v>

2460
02:39:38.700 --> 02:39:40.790
I'd say something at that point like,
Brooke,
can you,

2461
02:39:40.890 --> 02:39:43.100
my thing is the women are smoking.

2462
02:39:44.490 --> 02:39:46.260
It's that classic New York comedy.

2463
02:39:48.660 --> 02:39:53.610
Stupid fucking dumb bitch.
What'd you learn?

2464
02:39:53.611 --> 02:39:55.690
How to whisper the helicopter.
Go ahead.

2465
02:39:59.010 --> 02:40:01.380
But like at what point do you step it?

2466
02:40:01.381 --> 02:40:06.230
Like when the TV screens on the headrest.
Fuck your mom.

2467
02:40:06.231 --> 02:40:09.990
I know I'm going at it and that's where I like I'll give,
I'll give a look first.

2468
02:40:10.020 --> 02:40:13.920
Yeah.
Like a turn around.
Like,
you know my head's right,
the side of this

2469
02:40:14.750 --> 02:40:18.710
<v 11>and then I'm just like,
hey man,
it's a touch screen,
right?
Yeah.
You just,</v>

2470
02:40:19.020 --> 02:40:23.790
you just have to,
it's by the heat of your finger,
not the pressure.
Right,

2471
02:40:23.820 --> 02:40:27.270
right.
Hello?
Oh yeah.

2472
02:40:27.700 --> 02:40:31.150
<v 2>I've had a bitch back in the day.
Boom,
boom,
boom.
And I've turned around,
but like,</v>

2473
02:40:31.151 --> 02:40:33.790
could you,
could you please?
And she was like,
fuck you.
You Bitch.

2474
02:40:33.791 --> 02:40:37.390
Like she got mad at me.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
She's like,
fuck you.

2475
02:40:37.391 --> 02:40:40.040
I'll do what I want.
And I was like,
okay,
yeah,

2476
02:40:40.090 --> 02:40:43.690
I had to call over the flight attendants is years ago.
She was like hammering,

2477
02:40:43.691 --> 02:40:46.010
it was probably on your mom's house.
I brought it out and you turn it and you,

2478
02:40:46.011 --> 02:40:49.750
and I was like,
excuse me.
You know,
every time you do that I feel it.
Do you mind?

2479
02:40:50.140 --> 02:40:52.180
And she was like,
I'll do whatever I want.

2480
02:40:52.540 --> 02:40:55.930
Like she was sassing back to me and then I had to call a flight attendant.

2481
02:40:55.931 --> 02:40:57.160
I was like,
she's kind of crazy.

2482
02:40:57.310 --> 02:41:00.420
<v 11>Have you retaliatory farden like give you yes,</v>

2483
02:41:00.430 --> 02:41:03.790
I have like just fart interface.
Uh,
none of that time.

2484
02:41:03.791 --> 02:41:07.370
But I have farted when people next to me,
we're being very annoying.
Yeah.

2485
02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:10.280
And then I fart.
You do that too.
I'm like a skunk.

2486
02:41:11.100 --> 02:41:13.630
I'm getting defensive.
She also did it.

2487
02:41:13.990 --> 02:41:17.140
She also did it to somebody who didn't do anything wrong.

2488
02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:21.370
And then the lady was like,
smells like a dirty diaper in here.
Like,

2489
02:41:21.510 --> 02:41:26.050
because Christina was kind of lady was not smart.
I'm going to go.

2490
02:41:26.051 --> 02:41:30.970
That was it.
An accent from a country Wa was bad.

2491
02:41:30.980 --> 02:41:35.490
Here
you don't learn that accent.

2492
02:41:36.230 --> 02:41:39.190
He retarded.
That's not a regional,

2493
02:41:40.630 --> 02:41:41.980
it's because of this.

2494
02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:45.490
A lot of women out there fully fucking full of shit and it's stupid.

2495
02:41:47.740 --> 02:41:52.090
What do you think?
How would you say 90 or lady?
No,
no,
no.

2496
02:41:52.400 --> 02:41:55.930
I would definitely take like this.
Let me tell you,
Kelly,

2497
02:41:55.990 --> 02:41:59.020
I live with a small amount of fear every day and I like,
really,

2498
02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:01.920
I'm happy for that.
From,
from your lady?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Really well,

2499
02:42:01.930 --> 02:42:05.340
it's talking about it.
What are you afraid of?
Like what,
how does she remember me?

2500
02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:09.330
And you know,
no,
no,
I get a bad way.
But like,
pounce,
keep you in check.

2501
02:42:09.340 --> 02:42:14.140
Like flinch me.
Make me Flinch.
Huh?
Yeah.
It's a lot.
There's a lot of that.
Really.

2502
02:42:14.230 --> 02:42:18.700
Yeah.
I love it.
It's very attractive.
Yeah.
You apologize a lot for no reason.
Well,

2503
02:42:18.790 --> 02:42:23.380
no sir.
I was,
I was screwing around.
I love it.
Yeah,

2504
02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:27.880
you would like my toes.
I think he would like,
um,
hard rock nick.
Oh,

2505
02:42:27.881 --> 02:42:32.050
for God's sake.
It was hard rock,
man.
This dude's dues.
Bad Ass.

2506
02:42:32.080 --> 02:42:37.030
So that's sounds like it.
Yeah.
Like,
do you ever wear pink?

2507
02:42:37.060 --> 02:42:40.300
Big Fan of him embroidered satin jackets?
Uh,

2508
02:42:40.330 --> 02:42:44.180
you were everywhere pink or you like somebody comfortable with that?
Yeah.
You do,

2509
02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:47.600
man.
I don't have a lot.
I don't have,
I have a couple shirts.
Well,
all right,

2510
02:42:47.650 --> 02:42:51.940
well there's a couple of guys that were like,
like,
oh,
was that a real guy?

2511
02:42:52.570 --> 02:42:53.403
Yeah.

2512
02:42:56.710 --> 02:43:01.660
<v 15>Yeah.
What's up this question a lot.
That's not a real guy.</v>

2513
02:43:01.720 --> 02:43:04.840
Why do I wear pink so much?

2514
02:43:05.090 --> 02:43:09.460
I wear pink because I like pink pussies.
You know,

2515
02:43:09.461 --> 02:43:10.690
like inside.

2516
02:43:11.170 --> 02:43:16.170
I like to actually spread the pussy lips all been while I'm packing missionary.

2517
02:43:16.720 --> 02:43:17.553
That shit's hot.

2518
02:43:18.040 --> 02:43:23.040
And the other reason I like pink or wear pink is because if you look at all the

2519
02:43:23.171 --> 02:43:26.740
richest men in the world,
which I'm one of,
I have 20 million in the bank.

2520
02:43:26.741 --> 02:43:30.100
No bullshit.
Google it suck on my fucking testes.

2521
02:43:30.340 --> 02:43:35.340
Google all the richest men in the world where Pant 50 sat wears pink Tom Cruise.

2522
02:43:39.130 --> 02:43:43.840
Whereas paint Simon Rex fucking wears pink condoms.

2523
02:43:44.490 --> 02:43:48.820
So that's what it is.
20 million in the bank and fucking growing.

2524
02:43:50.170 --> 02:43:52.030
You don't need heroin.
You're this good looking baby

2525
02:43:53.400 --> 02:43:56.790
<v 11>real.
I refuse to believe that.</v>

2526
02:43:57.050 --> 02:44:00.710
Like now that had been kind of like that's a character I think is right.

2527
02:44:01.350 --> 02:44:03.900
Here's the thing,
if it was just this video,
I'd be like,

2528
02:44:03.930 --> 02:44:06.220
this dude's fucking savage.

2529
02:44:07.590 --> 02:44:11.790
But like committing that fucking etch a sketch,
goatee and shit.
Yeah,

2530
02:44:11.791 --> 02:44:15.470
there's more.
That's like the,
yeah,
that's like the Mr Fuzzy math.

2531
02:44:16.550 --> 02:44:19.020
But I just don't you think you're just kind of hating on him cause he's so

2532
02:44:19.021 --> 02:44:22.370
successful and he's got pink shirts.

2533
02:44:25.660 --> 02:44:29.360
I mean I appreciate his humility.
This is him.

2534
02:44:29.440 --> 02:44:33.730
How many people we got in here?
Not even 400 man.
The artwork,

2535
02:44:34.750 --> 02:44:38.590
there wasn't $30 but thank you.
This is one piece of artwork.

2536
02:44:38.710 --> 02:44:42.850
I mean y'all don't want to comment on the fact that I'm sitting in $1,000 custom

2537
02:44:42.851 --> 02:44:46.960
movie theater chair and I have five of them.
I mean retarded man.

2538
02:44:49.030 --> 02:44:52.440
This,
all these people under good,
you know,
movie theater seats are all five.

2539
02:44:52.441 --> 02:44:57.040
That's a dollar.
That's my movie.
Tickets are so much I got to pay for it

2540
02:44:58.570 --> 02:45:02.410
all is people under 35 what's wrong with you guys?

2541
02:45:02.411 --> 02:45:06.640
Why are you so angry?
Bitter?
Was it nine 11 natal vitamins?

2542
02:45:08.060 --> 02:45:11.740
Then you guys felt robbed of your youth.
Was it Columbine?

2543
02:45:11.741 --> 02:45:16.000
Was it all these mass shootings that you guys got terror struck in you from your

2544
02:45:16.001 --> 02:45:19.000
media and mom and dad?
I'm like,
what the fuck?

2545
02:45:19.420 --> 02:45:22.150
I was happy when people got rich.

2546
02:45:22.750 --> 02:45:27.520
I'm still happy when people get rich on a game show or from winning the lottery

2547
02:45:27.521 --> 02:45:32.140
or from winning American idol or from success or a comeback like,

2548
02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:33.310
oh my God,

2549
02:45:34.720 --> 02:45:38.680
this is just the retardation of your generation.

2550
02:45:40.150 --> 02:45:44.770
Awesome.
He used to Amazon deliveries a week.
Now it's one.
Go ahead.
No,

2551
02:45:44.771 --> 02:45:48.180
the other way.
Oh,
you're right.
You're right.
It used to be to what is hardcore.

2552
02:45:48.190 --> 02:45:51.490
Nick's a backstory.
Excuse me.
It's hard rock nick.
Well,
it's funny.

2553
02:45:51.520 --> 02:45:53.500
You know what you could do or do you pull up his bio,

2554
02:45:53.710 --> 02:45:58.650
his bio that had a little info on the bio really lays it out and it's,

2555
02:45:58.651 --> 02:46:02.920
um,
what it's going to make you do is probably rewrite your own bio if you don't

2556
02:46:02.921 --> 02:46:05.200
mind.
Need to.
Anyway,
so that's what I'm saying.

2557
02:46:05.510 --> 02:46:09.860
So could you read his bio out loud?
It's right there.
That's his bio.

2558
02:46:09.890 --> 02:46:11.420
He looks like a rape genie.

2559
02:46:15.930 --> 02:46:20.720
Will you let it?
You let it rip.
You don't get no witches,

2560
02:46:20.721 --> 02:46:21.770
but I'm out now.

2561
02:46:24.710 --> 02:46:26.000
I'll give you something to wish

2562
02:46:28.410 --> 02:46:33.290
<v 13>so it's,
it's in a caption.
All right,
so he posted that picture.
Go ahead.</v>

2563
02:46:33.660 --> 02:46:36.460
On my 12th Mercedes Benz like,

2564
02:46:36.670 --> 02:46:39.100
like as a hot dog eating contest.
Yeah.

2565
02:46:40.280 --> 02:46:42.920
I'm on my 12th one that keep fucking these things up.

2566
02:46:44.810 --> 02:46:47.000
Born in Las Vegas.
You could stop there.

2567
02:46:49.750 --> 02:46:51.950
That's got a lot of houses.
Where does you usually shop?

2568
02:46:51.951 --> 02:46:56.840
Doe over $30,000 a tattoos on my body.
Easily shops at Bristol farms.

2569
02:46:59.530 --> 02:47:02.930
Oh,
okay.
Average one Amazon.

2570
02:47:03.650 --> 02:47:06.620
What does that have to do this?
He shows you he's always shopping bro.

2571
02:47:07.340 --> 02:47:09.270
How many packages a week you get bitch.
Yeah.

2572
02:47:09.271 --> 02:47:12.170
How many but I going to say what cow but without seeing what he gets

2573
02:47:14.510 --> 02:47:18.540
10 pack toothbrushes from Amazon.
That's my pack.

2574
02:47:18.541 --> 02:47:23.410
Just week worth of good,
good.
Three 50 350 million.

2575
02:47:23.411 --> 02:47:28.310
That kind of house I live in prefer eating pussy from the bath.

2576
02:47:29.870 --> 02:47:34.610
Okay.
Love.
And I mean love getting mud deck so it feels good.

2577
02:47:35.270 --> 02:47:39.890
Almost 300 pounds.
But carry it like I'm 210 pounds.
What is specific?

2578
02:47:41.050 --> 02:47:44.630
No,
I didn't want to go 200 cause that's like,

2579
02:47:44.631 --> 02:47:48.520
that's too obvious to 10 that's true.
I'm thinking about Alexa,

2580
02:47:48.800 --> 02:47:52.790
the shit out of my house.
Yeah.
He's got a lot of Alexis.

2581
02:47:55.550 --> 02:47:57.890
He's got a lot of,
you know what I mean?
That's some,

2582
02:47:58.040 --> 02:48:01.100
that's when you want to stunt on your guests.
Be like,
check out all these Alexis.

2583
02:48:01.101 --> 02:48:02.840
I got,
Hey Alexa,
and then you just,

2584
02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:06.140
<v 11>but Alexa doesn't understand half the shit you say to her.
Anyway.
Alexa,</v>

2585
02:48:06.141 --> 02:48:10.580
keep Alexa company.
All right.
This is,

2586
02:48:10.910 --> 02:48:14.990
this is where the AI meltdown starts as this guy's house.
If it's true.

2587
02:48:15.110 --> 02:48:19.580
That's how the robots learn to communicate with one another to defeat the
humans.

2588
02:48:19.700 --> 02:48:22.280
That's where I go with it.
Like this guy is going to be the cause of it.

2589
02:48:22.550 --> 02:48:27.020
Look at his eyelashes.
What he cares.
Firms

2590
02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:31.670
<v 13>care for himself.
Why you hate him.
I just said he cares for him,
so okay.
Okay.</v>

2591
02:48:31.671 --> 02:48:33.970
I just wanted to make sure there was no misunderstanding.

2592
02:48:35.690 --> 02:48:37.820
<v 11>He looks like those look like fake lashes.</v>

2593
02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:41.450
I think this guy does throw a little bit on the makeup and everything.

2594
02:48:42.100 --> 02:48:44.720
I think he's got it.
He's like rich and crazy,

2595
02:48:44.721 --> 02:48:48.640
but then messes around with some may really think he's rich.

2596
02:48:48.700 --> 02:48:52.160
That's our mother fucking hate.

2597
02:48:53.960 --> 02:48:57.870
<v 13>Oh,
that's him.
And he finance for white girls.</v>

2598
02:48:58.150 --> 02:49:02.620
<v 11>Well that's another thing.
He's also racist.
He didn't love him.</v>

2599
02:49:02.621 --> 02:49:06.430
Now if he didn't love him before,
I mean now you're really going to,

2600
02:49:06.460 --> 02:49:08.310
can you read this loud?
Uh,
Kyle,

2601
02:49:08.600 --> 02:49:11.560
<v 13>right?
Okay ladies.
Yeah.</v>

2602
02:49:11.810 --> 02:49:16.250
If you have an ass like this and our pure white American born female,

2603
02:49:16.550 --> 02:49:19.520
not mixed with Mexican or Israeli and Shit,

2604
02:49:21.910 --> 02:49:26.330
have light eyes and a career and we'll let me put my face in it.

2605
02:49:26.331 --> 02:49:28.700
Every time you bend over the sink to do your makeup,

2606
02:49:28.790 --> 02:49:29.623
<v 11>get at me.</v>

2607
02:49:31.540 --> 02:49:33.980
I wish you would read all this guy.

2608
02:49:33.981 --> 02:49:37.970
Looks like he's whatever ethnicity genies are from and he's going to say no

2609
02:49:37.971 --> 02:49:42.970
Mexican or Israeli.
Every Jeannie is Mexicans railing.
Yeah,

2610
02:49:42.980 --> 02:49:45.350
I think you're right.
It's always like a Mexican Israeli flag.

2611
02:49:45.351 --> 02:49:48.430
This is like a self hate.
Always Mexican Israeli,
you know,

2612
02:49:48.480 --> 02:49:52.070
you know that's how they work.
That's how,
how about this,
Oh boy,

2613
02:49:52.250 --> 02:49:55.670
the 10 turn offs and a woman in order of level of turn off

2614
02:49:56.840 --> 02:50:00.600
<v 13>number one non Caucasian,
right?</v>

2615
02:50:01.310 --> 02:50:03.800
I mean you gotta know what you want in this world.

2616
02:50:03.801 --> 02:50:07.380
What do you like smoke or have any kind of vegetarian wears too much makeup,

2617
02:50:07.400 --> 02:50:11.330
wears perfume from Walmart or Tj Maxx,
et cetera.

2618
02:50:13.010 --> 02:50:15.090
Never says thank you.
Oh see look,
he likes it.

2619
02:50:15.170 --> 02:50:20.170
Pilliga prudish sexually as visible facial hair.

2620
02:50:20.391 --> 02:50:25.130
Even Peach Fuzz as a child from a previous man.
Won't shop.

2621
02:50:25.160 --> 02:50:27.980
Eat,
do yoga anywhere unless she has a coupon.

2622
02:50:27.981 --> 02:50:31.540
Groupon magazine clipping.
There you go.
All right.

2623
02:50:31.550 --> 02:50:33.650
Now this is from 2012

2624
02:50:33.810 --> 02:50:37.350
<v 11>he may have a ball.
Have we checked up on Nicholas' rack?</v>

2625
02:50:37.351 --> 02:50:41.150
Johanson Shroud?
I don't know.
No,
I don't know.

2626
02:50:41.160 --> 02:50:45.520
We haven't seen those photos in the livestream.

2627
02:50:45.670 --> 02:50:46.780
All recent current.

2628
02:50:47.230 --> 02:50:50.700
But this is a very specific list cause he contacted you guys.

2629
02:50:50.701 --> 02:50:55.320
Is he come around the beach?
No,

2630
02:50:55.390 --> 02:50:58.590
no.
Really.
You don't want to hard rock nick around here.

2631
02:51:01.450 --> 02:51:02.360
<v 13>I mean you're both white.</v>

2632
02:51:03.850 --> 02:51:07.030
<v 11>Well it'd be cool with it.
You know what I realized is that,</v>

2633
02:51:08.230 --> 02:51:11.390
well blue band is,

2634
02:51:11.440 --> 02:51:13.790

2635
02:51:14.110 --> 02:51:17.550
Just qualified from the running for it.
Yeah.

2636
02:51:17.750 --> 02:51:21.570
I got some Jewish Israeli blooded take a hike.
Yup.

2637
02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.240
Fuzz
face.

2638
02:51:27.270 --> 02:51:31.190
Do you like being eaten out from the back will come at you?

2639
02:51:31.191 --> 02:51:32.950
Human Centipede Style

2640
02:51:37.970 --> 02:51:42.440
and I'm also not American born and I'm old as fuck for him to blow your side.

2641
02:51:42.441 --> 02:51:46.300
Definitely not
for me.
I'm just going to look at,

2642
02:51:46.310 --> 02:51:47.990
cause I know we're going to be bros immediately.

2643
02:51:48.300 --> 02:51:52.160
Like he'll see me and be like similar.
Look,
you seem to get your eyebrows dark

2644
02:51:56.080 --> 02:51:59.930
beard.
Beard.
We're sculpting.

2645
02:52:00.780 --> 02:52:02.630
Get like a detailer.

2646
02:52:05.280 --> 02:52:06.010
A hard

2647
02:52:06.010 --> 02:52:10.480
<v 13>rock.
Nick's beard.
Oh Man.
I would love for you to do then you Halloween people,</v>

2648
02:52:10.560 --> 02:52:13.590
right?
I Dunno,

2649
02:52:13.630 --> 02:52:16.060
but man if it was September right now,

2650
02:52:18.640 --> 02:52:21.280
pretty bad ass.
I'd be like,
I'm hard rock.

2651
02:52:23.320 --> 02:52:26.710
People just think you're making a,
making fun of any Armenian.

2652
02:52:28.090 --> 02:52:30.230
And you said Armenian Armenian

2653
02:52:32.360 --> 02:52:37.000
or Armenian?
Nicholas Rock.
Johansen bullshit.

2654
02:52:37.090 --> 02:52:39.870
That is a matter of
middle names.

2655
02:52:39.880 --> 02:52:43.770
Rock Nicholas.
No,
no.

2656
02:52:43.940 --> 02:52:45.550
This guy's either Persian.
Armenian.

2657
02:52:48.360 --> 02:52:53.320
Yeah.
They're proud of their wealth.
Look at the bright side.

2658
02:52:53.321 --> 02:52:57.570
$350 million.
Didn't say how he made it,
right?
No.
Well I mean,
you know,

2659
02:52:58.170 --> 02:53:00.970
obviously entrepreneur online poker,

2660
02:53:02.770 --> 02:53:06.220
poker would definitely fit.
He's got online poker vibe for sure.

2661
02:53:06.221 --> 02:53:07.340
Regular Poker vibe.

2662
02:53:09.120 --> 02:53:14.120
I was always fascinated with the confident nerds of poker championship,

2663
02:53:16.190 --> 02:53:18.760
of just the swagger of a,

2664
02:53:18.850 --> 02:53:23.850
of a pope and classes also like all the looks that are like you turds,

2665
02:53:26.320 --> 02:53:29.200
can you,
are you in?
Are you,
do you like poker?
No,

2666
02:53:30.280 --> 02:53:34.270
I've never been into it and what really blew my mind was when it became

2667
02:53:35.040 --> 02:53:38.200
televise.
I'm like motherfuckers on his watching this bullshit.

2668
02:53:38.230 --> 02:53:40.810
That was well that's what would drive me nuts.
It's like,

2669
02:53:40.840 --> 02:53:44.170
you know Matt Brown and I used to do closed captioning for living.

2670
02:53:44.171 --> 02:53:49.171
Dan was what we do for t for our day jobs and we'd have to close caption all

2671
02:53:49.430 --> 02:53:52.360
those poker tournaments.
It's the most infuriating,

2672
02:53:52.361 --> 02:53:55.120
like just listening to your playing cards.

2673
02:53:55.150 --> 02:53:57.310
I wouldn't want to stand around watching you play cards,

2674
02:53:57.720 --> 02:54:02.500
let alone have to type out all the words they're saying it's a three nuts on the

2675
02:54:02.501 --> 02:54:06.990
flop and the river.
I'm like,
this is
terrible.

2676
02:54:07.140 --> 02:54:10.240
And everybody's got their own interests.
But I go to Vegas and I play the war.

2677
02:54:10.270 --> 02:54:12.040
I'll play like roulette,
which is the worst odds,

2678
02:54:12.041 --> 02:54:15.910
but I can't fuck him anything other than playing it.
Yeah.
Poker,
blackjack.

2679
02:54:15.911 --> 02:54:19.010
I could screw something up and then I lost because I was done.

2680
02:54:19.020 --> 02:54:23.980
But the thing about blackjack too,
fun spinning,
Spinning wheels,
fun blackjack.

2681
02:54:24.130 --> 02:54:28.390
You can fuck it up for other people.
Well that's fun.
Yeah.
Well it's also,

2682
02:54:28.391 --> 02:54:31.660
but it's also the thing I've seen people be like,
are you fucking serious?

2683
02:54:31.661 --> 02:54:32.494
We're going to hit on,
you know,

2684
02:54:33.950 --> 02:54:36.770
like people get really fired up on those uh,

2685
02:54:36.900 --> 02:54:41.290
blackjack and I don't understand at all.
I don't think anybody does.

2686
02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:45.610
I think that's how craps exists is nobody knows what they're doing.

2687
02:54:46.080 --> 02:54:49.630
And also throw down a 20 on the high hand.
Let me get a low hook on the Yoyo.

2688
02:54:51.320 --> 02:54:54.580
I was in Reno where I had done a show and didn't do great and then I was kind of

2689
02:54:54.581 --> 02:54:59.190
shuffled around the casino and these kind of grizzled mountain full or there and

2690
02:54:59.200 --> 02:55:02.360
they're like,
you a real funny man.
Play craps with us.
It was like,
all right,

2691
02:55:02.361 --> 02:55:05.480
and I like,
I lost 10 bucks and I'm like,
I don't have any more money.
It's like,

2692
02:55:05.600 --> 02:55:08.800
don't worry,
man.
Gave me 100 bucks.
I was like,
wow.
I'm like,
hey man,

2693
02:55:08.801 --> 02:55:11.630
I want to take your money.
He's like,
don't worry about it,
man.
We grilled.

2694
02:55:12.390 --> 02:55:15.590
He just kept and he kept touching the table and the lady would have to step and

2695
02:55:15.591 --> 02:55:18.380
be like,
don't touch the table as well.
We'll,
sorry ma'am.

2696
02:55:19.700 --> 02:55:23.360
These old pot farmers throwing all their money on just grabbing shit off the

2697
02:55:23.361 --> 02:55:25.940
table,
get yelled at.
It was a good time.
That's fun though.

2698
02:55:26.030 --> 02:55:27.920
Nobody knew what they were doing,
but it would be fun.

2699
02:55:27.950 --> 02:55:32.950
I've played craps twice with seasoned the players an hour with each of them.

2700
02:55:32.961 --> 02:55:35.720
I was like,
I have no idea who the fuck's going on.
It's still luck.
Yeah,

2701
02:55:35.880 --> 02:55:38.260
it's luck.
It's all last time I played craps,
I was at,

2702
02:55:38.261 --> 02:55:42.840
I was in Vegas and I went to go see rock of ages by myself because I,
you know,

2703
02:55:42.850 --> 02:55:46.520
oh,
hang out.
I don't care.
Rock of ages,
the musical about the sunset strip,

2704
02:55:46.521 --> 02:55:48.140
eighties rock music.
And that was that.

2705
02:55:48.170 --> 02:55:53.170
I was one of maybe 40 people in the entire amphitheater and I was singing along

2706
02:55:54.051 --> 02:55:56.410
and clapping and crying at the sentimental part.
Yeah.

2707
02:55:56.810 --> 02:56:00.310
And then the woman next to me who kept kind of spilling my beer,
uh,

2708
02:56:00.510 --> 02:56:02.930
she give me 20 bucks as we walked out cause she,

2709
02:56:02.931 --> 02:56:06.020
I guess I look like my wife just left me or something cause I was getting way

2710
02:56:06.021 --> 02:56:10.070
too.
I was getting way too in a rock of ages by myself and she's like,

2711
02:56:10.100 --> 02:56:13.220
I'm sorry for dinner.
Here you go honey.
I'm like,
I'm actually have a great time.

2712
02:56:13.220 --> 02:56:16.640
You don't have to do this.
She's like,
no,
no,
no.
You take this 20 bucks.

2713
02:56:16.910 --> 02:56:19.330
And I blew it on the craps table.
Sweet though.

2714
02:56:20.270 --> 02:56:22.870
I guess I looked pretty bad shape.
Yeah,

2715
02:56:23.120 --> 02:56:27.170
I guess I look like a real sad dude having fun.
No.
Have you had that,

2716
02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:28.820
cause I know you're real,

2717
02:56:28.880 --> 02:56:33.880

2760
03:00:01.280 --> 03:00:04.350
Fatso company.
That's my favorite one.

2761
03:00:04.910 --> 03:00:07.320
It's a company that somebody like production card.

2762
03:00:07.410 --> 03:00:10.170
Could you imagine this person raising you?
This is actually my mom.

2763
03:00:10.370 --> 03:00:14.380
This is literally,
it's a lot.
It is a lot of she main lady.

2764
03:00:14.450 --> 03:00:15.283
She was crazy though.

2765
03:00:15.810 --> 03:00:19.850
But those are the kind of shit you would do to like fucking bitch and then she

2766
03:00:19.851 --> 03:00:23.760
would get mad at people for seeding her too close to the toilet at restaurants.

2767
03:00:24.300 --> 03:00:26.350
She get real racist too,
like these fucking,

2768
03:00:28.330 --> 03:00:30.750
Oh God,

2769
03:00:33.030 --> 03:00:36.090
Vietnamese restaurant.
We went to Sushi.
It was a Japanese

2770
03:00:38.930 --> 03:00:42.150
in the ballpark but then to the ladies just like,

2771
03:00:42.151 --> 03:00:43.860

He's like,
you know what you did,

2772
03:00:43.861 --> 03:00:48.090
you're fucking crazy
angry.

2773
03:00:48.740 --> 03:00:51.540
I saw my mom freak out once but it was only on my behalf.

2774
03:00:51.780 --> 03:00:54.000
Then it like wasn't racist or anything like I bought the wrong,

2775
03:00:54.420 --> 03:00:57.030
I was like a little kid at Bros by and I thought I was buying like a model

2776
03:00:57.660 --> 03:01:00.040
garage for model cars,
but it turned out to be like the little

2777
03:01:00.040 --> 03:01:03.610
<v 13>figures and I couldn't even see the counter that says no returns on it at the</v>

2778
03:01:03.611 --> 03:01:06.910
hobby shop and saw my mom like the guy wouldn't give me my money back.

2779
03:01:06.911 --> 03:01:10.510
It's my mom went there.
It was like my son can't even see your no return sign.

2780
03:01:10.511 --> 03:01:11.950
He thought it was nothing's broken.

2781
03:01:11.951 --> 03:01:13.750
He just took the plastic off and the guy wouldn't do it.

2782
03:01:13.751 --> 03:01:17.390
So my mom just sat there and anybody walk in,
don't touch anything.
This guy,

2783
03:01:17.391 --> 03:01:18.460
I won't give you refunds.

2784
03:01:18.760 --> 03:01:23.760
And then had to call mall security and now my mom's about to get arrested flow,

2785
03:01:24.040 --> 03:01:26.980
but she's standing up.
She's like,
I'm doing this for you.
I'm like,
please stop.

2786
03:01:27.310 --> 03:01:28.143
Please stop it.

2787
03:01:28.210 --> 03:01:32.740
Classmates are here and they see you now being talked to by mall security

2788
03:01:32.860 --> 03:01:37.690
because you're harassing all customers in Italy.
Shutdowns,
toys and hobbies.

2789
03:01:38.530 --> 03:01:41.980
But she was like,
she's a righteous lady.
She is a righteous lamps.
They,

2790
03:01:41.981 --> 03:01:46.480
it wasn't talked to her today.
Yeah,
I got one sister older or younger?

2791
03:01:46.600 --> 03:01:49.870
Younger.
She lives here.
She moved down here a little while.
How long ago?

2792
03:01:50.780 --> 03:01:52.000
A year and a half ago.

2793
03:01:52.040 --> 03:01:54.880
You get to see each other a lot and we hang out and we're good.
That's cool.

2794
03:01:54.940 --> 03:01:58.600
Family Salad,
you know?
Yeah.
What's,
yeah,
like I got nothing.

2795
03:01:58.780 --> 03:02:00.460
You know what my mom used to do?
That was really funny.

2796
03:02:00.510 --> 03:02:01.760
When we would go to the mall

2797
03:02:02.010 --> 03:02:05.580
<v 0>department store and I used a company.
Your mom so you know,</v>

2798
03:02:05.850 --> 03:02:10.850
she has like olive skin and she has this heavy accent and everybody would always

2799
03:02:11.071 --> 03:02:14.010
be like,
where are you from?
And so she would always say,

2800
03:02:14.011 --> 03:02:16.860
guess and then so they would be a,
you know,

2801
03:02:16.920 --> 03:02:19.980
a lot of times with Russian and not,

2802
03:02:20.910 --> 03:02:24.780
not once or twice a number of times when I was with her they would go,

2803
03:02:24.930 --> 03:02:29.370
they would go,
they would like talk because she would say a,
you know,

2804
03:02:29.371 --> 03:02:32.020
I went to buy the blah blah blah.
And they would be like,
do you speak to,

2805
03:02:32.070 --> 03:02:36.810
are you Chinese?
And my mom would go yes.

2806
03:02:37.510 --> 03:02:41.850
And then,
and they would go say something in Chinese,
like just,

2807
03:02:41.851 --> 03:02:45.840
just like a lady will work in the makeup counter and my mom would go,

2808
03:02:46.110 --> 03:02:50.180
<v 13>she was my time and then they would go like,
whoa.</v>

2809
03:02:51.920 --> 03:02:55.850
And then she would just look at me and say she was off out and I'd be like,

2810
03:02:55.851 --> 03:02:57.590
she's looking for makeup remover.

2811
03:03:02.830 --> 03:03:06.500
And they were like,
that's so cool that your mom speaks Chinese.
And I'm like,

2812
03:03:07.420 --> 03:03:09.570
you know it dip shit.
Yeah,

2813
03:03:10.780 --> 03:03:14.150
that bagger grocery bagger.

2814
03:03:20.140 --> 03:03:24.170
Go ahead.
No,
you tell you tell him.
I did.

2815
03:03:24.390 --> 03:03:26.020
I look at you too,
sweetheart.

2816
03:03:27.460 --> 03:03:29.740
I used to do this all the time where like

2817
03:03:30.370 --> 03:03:34.930
<v 0>I did two things like bread,
a stoplight and uh,</v>

2818
03:03:35.180 --> 03:03:40.180
somebody crossing the street who had clearly is a disabled,

2819
03:03:42.350 --> 03:03:46.790
like walking with it.
Sure.
I would go,
uh,
just to my mom,

2820
03:03:46.850 --> 03:03:49.790
cause I knew I would get her.
I'd be like,
okay,
this guy,

2821
03:03:49.791 --> 03:03:54.210
I'll drunk 10 o'clock in the morning and she would be like,

2822
03:03:55.350 --> 03:03:58.070
what?
She's like,
he a problem.

2823
03:03:59.240 --> 03:04:02.390
<v 3>I was like,
yeah,
he's a drunk and I just drive off.</v>

2824
03:04:03.440 --> 03:04:07.850
And then at the grocery store they have a grocery store near them that we'll

2825
03:04:07.851 --> 03:04:10.370
hire like a special needs people.

2826
03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:15.700
So just to mess with her,
I would,
um,
like they

2827
03:04:16.180 --> 03:04:20.150
<v 11>bag and
bag it up</v>

2828
03:04:20.900 --> 03:04:22.070
<v 3>and then take it to the car.</v>

2829
03:04:22.520 --> 03:04:27.050
And then like a guy would put it in the car and that's what that was the job.

2830
03:04:27.310 --> 03:04:30.860
And then as he walked away,
I would just look at her real seriously.
An ideal.

2831
03:04:31.480 --> 03:04:32.660
I think something's wrong with that guy.

2832
03:04:33.810 --> 03:04:36.100
<v 11>She,
she didn't know what</v>

2833
03:04:40.250 --> 03:04:44.050
is wrong with that,
but she was like,
yes,
no,

2834
03:04:47.160 --> 03:04:51.660
no,
you're good.

2835
03:04:54.890 --> 03:04:55.723
Cool.

2836
03:04:57.340 --> 03:05:01.980
<v 3>No,
it's fun to have a foreign parent toy with.</v>

2837
03:05:01.990 --> 03:05:05.820
But she also doesn't know like that.

2838
03:05:05.920 --> 03:05:10.090
Even now the r word is not desirable to say.

2839
03:05:10.600 --> 03:05:11.710
And um,

2840
03:05:11.770 --> 03:05:16.510
and I've heard her say it in front of people like in a casual setting and I'm

2841
03:05:16.511 --> 03:05:17.344
like,
yeah,

2842
03:05:17.830 --> 03:05:20.180
<v 2>you could see people's face be like,
Whoa,</v>

2843
03:05:20.450 --> 03:05:25.070
this is a 70 year old lady and really throwing that cause it's like it's a,

2844
03:05:25.220 --> 03:05:28.580
you know,
it's still like foreign language to her.
You know,

2845
03:05:29.460 --> 03:05:32.360
people have like me and I understand we're not supposed to say all that stuff,

2846
03:05:32.361 --> 03:05:36.830
but the over sensitivity to it,
like older people who are immigrant and foreign,

2847
03:05:36.831 --> 03:05:38.700
like English isn't their first language.

2848
03:05:38.701 --> 03:05:42.370
Like they don't have the same sensitivity.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2849
03:05:42.670 --> 03:05:46.180
<v 14>I heard that defensive like,
like somebody in Europe using the n word,</v>

2850
03:05:46.181 --> 03:05:47.890
like they're not using it racist.
They're using it.

2851
03:05:47.891 --> 03:05:52.120
Cause I grew up listening to hip hop and that was like a punctuated throughout

2852
03:05:52.121 --> 03:05:55.360
that.
So they don't have like the historical context that you have here in this

2853
03:05:55.361 --> 03:05:58.120
country that just say it because they pop bars,
it doesn't make it right,

2854
03:05:58.121 --> 03:06:02.230
but the awareness is there.
I would feel I would agree with that.

2855
03:06:02.380 --> 03:06:03.790
I feel like that generated like people,

2856
03:06:03.791 --> 03:06:06.640
like we grew up saying words that I'm like,

2857
03:06:06.641 --> 03:06:10.140
I can't believe like how often you would just say faggot or something as a plan

2858
03:06:10.150 --> 03:06:11.980
now it's like,
yeah,
I would not do that.

2859
03:06:12.010 --> 03:06:16.210
I know now and it's not like PC culture says no,
I know that word.

2860
03:06:16.300 --> 03:06:18.000
It's Shitty.
That was it.

2861
03:06:18.010 --> 03:06:21.430
And I think like my parents and our parents' generation was that,

2862
03:06:21.431 --> 03:06:24.730
that with some other words and then when they learn that you can't say that

2863
03:06:24.731 --> 03:06:28.780
anymore.
It became this like kind of forbidden thing.
It totally

2864
03:06:30.300 --> 03:06:32.680
like if Brazil nuts showed up in my house,

2865
03:06:33.310 --> 03:06:36.970
they showed up because somebody needed a fix.
So

2866
03:06:38.910 --> 03:06:41.080
you know,
we used to call these,
I'm like,
yes.
Yes,

2867
03:06:41.081 --> 03:06:44.200
you'd say it every time Brazil nuts are in the house.
Yeah,

2868
03:06:45.340 --> 03:06:49.060
<v 2>that one I never got by it away.
Well my mom would say it with shame.</v>

2869
03:06:49.390 --> 03:06:51.290
<v 14>Can you not going to believe what we used to call these?
I'm like,</v>

2870
03:06:51.291 --> 03:06:54.450
I will believe it.
Because you say that every time you see a Brazil nut.
Yeah.

2871
03:06:54.470 --> 03:06:59.250
Like you're scratching an itch right now.
Not because I think it'll,

2872
03:06:59.251 --> 03:07:04.080
well it's just the physical composing of making the word that you can't anymore.

2873
03:07:04.110 --> 03:07:09.050
Yeah,
because,
because the taboo,
it feels like a day or two.
You know,
like the,

2874
03:07:09.390 --> 03:07:11.520
the further case for the,
like the,

2875
03:07:11.760 --> 03:07:15.930
the English as a second language person is that some of those words just don't

2876
03:07:15.931 --> 03:07:19.080
have that same impact in their minds.
You know,

2877
03:07:19.081 --> 03:07:22.110
that it has on ours tax was never there,
never there.

2878
03:07:22.111 --> 03:07:25.110
And it sounds like if I told you,
you know,
whatever you do,

2879
03:07:25.111 --> 03:07:29.390
don't say Bozeman when you're around these people,
you're going to be like,
okay,

2880
03:07:29.430 --> 03:07:31.860
like you know it,
but you're like,
it doesn't hurt.
And when I say it,

2881
03:07:31.890 --> 03:07:36.510
but also like don't say it,
you're like,
hmm.
Yeah,
like my cousin about elephants,

2882
03:07:36.810 --> 03:07:41.160
Shit.
My cousins used to come over and drop everything.
Like everything was like,

2883
03:07:41.161 --> 03:07:45.760
don't ever say these six words.
They'd be,
like I say,
it's right now.
And like,

2884
03:07:45.810 --> 03:07:50.280
they'll say it,
it's like,
uh,
the fag thing,
which was so like,
you know,

2885
03:07:50.281 --> 03:07:53.130
throwing that around in middle school and a lot,
dude,

2886
03:07:53.150 --> 03:07:56.490
they came for Thanksgiving and I meet them at a,

2887
03:07:56.520 --> 03:08:00.040
I haven't seen some of them in 10 years and as I walk into a restaurant,

2888
03:08:00.041 --> 03:08:05.010
but these are 35,
36 year old man.
They go,
fuck God that was there.
Hello.

2889
03:08:09.130 --> 03:08:13.860
<v 13>There's no,
no,
don't do it.
Like where are they from?
Peru.
Peru.
Okay.
Yeah,</v>

2890
03:08:14.470 --> 03:08:17.680
I mean they have like a heavy act,
like their English isn't,
we're just like,

2891
03:08:17.681 --> 03:08:19.450
I remembered the words were not supposed to say,

2892
03:08:23.630 --> 03:08:26.830
but I think also like the generation,
I don't think it's just foreign parents.

2893
03:08:26.831 --> 03:08:27.160
Like

2894
03:08:27.160 --> 03:08:31.310
<v 14>what you can do with humor.
It's like my mom,
like,
like when your kid,</v>

2895
03:08:31.380 --> 03:08:33.970
when you find out your kids are actually funny on their own,
right.

2896
03:08:34.450 --> 03:08:37.030
Like I think my mom would encourage a little bit like me and my sister,

2897
03:08:37.150 --> 03:08:41.770
the student driver cars would come by our house and so we would always crash our

2898
03:08:41.771 --> 03:08:46.270
bikes right behind like Duke,
some solid over the bars,
Prat.

2899
03:08:46.420 --> 03:08:48.910
So they were just like a student driver would see in the rear view mirror,

2900
03:08:49.310 --> 03:08:52.520
<v 13>bike fly up and then a kid just laying there and I'm like,</v>

2901
03:08:52.521 --> 03:08:53.750
I'd run up to my sister like,

2902
03:08:53.910 --> 03:08:58.610
are you okay if my mom would be in the house laughing her ass off and she'd be

2903
03:08:58.611 --> 03:09:01.490
like,
you guys shouldn't do that.
It's real funny.

2904
03:09:02.420 --> 03:09:05.360
Would reprimand us but not hard enough to be like,
if it comes round again,

2905
03:09:05.390 --> 03:09:07.710
I got to get your dad to watch too.
It was pretty funny.

2906
03:09:08.620 --> 03:09:10.300
Well that's a struggle we have with,
uh,

2907
03:09:10.370 --> 03:09:14.870
with our three year old is that now he's starting to say shit like he's learning

2908
03:09:14.871 --> 03:09:16.460
to burp and fart and that's like

2909
03:09:17.700 --> 03:09:21.260
<v 14>that.
And we also tell them nobody discourage any burp.</v>

2910
03:09:21.261 --> 03:09:25.170
It's one thumbs up if it's foreign,
it's two thumbs up.
And then we're like,
ah,

2911
03:09:25.910 --> 03:09:28.520
<v 13>raise just cave piece savages like this,</v>

2912
03:09:28.521 --> 03:09:31.550
this you've years of documentation then that's what,

2913
03:09:31.551 --> 03:09:34.760
I can't imagine it like trying to raise a kid and they're going to have a sample

2914
03:09:34.761 --> 03:09:37.400
board like that of everything you've said.
Like,
Oh really?

2915
03:09:37.510 --> 03:09:42.260
Were you guys farted in the microphones?
I can't do what?
Well,

2916
03:09:42.261 --> 03:09:45.290
it says differently.
He also got no cards anymore.

2917
03:09:46.280 --> 03:09:49.010
He learns that if the doorbell rings,
that means off.
Fuck

2918
03:09:52.960 --> 03:09:53.793
true.

2919
03:09:54.000 --> 03:09:58.080
<v 11>It's got a world of hurt
because I,</v>

2920
03:09:58.120 --> 03:10:02.500
that was my natural to the doorbell ringing just cause like I was comfortable.

2921
03:10:02.740 --> 03:10:06.880
So you heard and I was like,
oh fuck.
As soon as I did it he was like fuck.

2922
03:10:07.330 --> 03:10:11.920
Like just looked right at me.
Here we go.
Shit,
somebody got a new favorite word.

2923
03:10:11.921 --> 03:10:12.890
I don't discourage

2924
03:10:13.280 --> 03:10:16.260
<v 0>picking either.
I can't,
I mean I still</v>

2925
03:10:18.120 --> 03:10:23.120
do you feel like it's Elementary Watch for picking the yeah,

2926
03:10:26.070 --> 03:10:27.570
we'll get in there.
Yeah,

2927
03:10:29.430 --> 03:10:31.080
that was a bad thing when my girlfriend,

2928
03:10:31.090 --> 03:10:33.960
when we live separately and I'd be at her house and then she was like moving

2929
03:10:33.961 --> 03:10:35.740
stuff around and she's like a Frederick booger grave.

2930
03:10:37.790 --> 03:10:38.623
<v 16>Ah,</v>

2931
03:10:38.940 --> 03:10:41.510
<v 11>you don't know how many of you are putting down there until one day somebody</v>

2932
03:10:41.511 --> 03:10:42.344
moves the bed,

2933
03:10:43.790 --> 03:10:48.790
<v 0>pick my nose and wipe him on the back of a couch when I was like in high school</v>

2934
03:10:50.210 --> 03:10:51.430
and one time they,

2935
03:10:51.500 --> 03:10:53.900
there was some repair and that needed to be done on that couch.

2936
03:10:53.930 --> 03:10:56.570
I never thought of that.
The guy comes to service,

2937
03:10:56.571 --> 03:10:59.210
it moves the couch and there's just dried.

2938
03:10:59.350 --> 03:11:00.183
<v 16>Okay.</v>

2939
03:11:02.110 --> 03:11:05.730
<v 11>That's how I watch my one friend freaking another for like first friend who like</v>

2940
03:11:05.731 --> 03:11:08.100
at his own place,
like at a townhouse were over there.

2941
03:11:08.280 --> 03:11:11.490
My Buddy Bob's just going at it and finally my friend Jessie ended off,

2942
03:11:11.491 --> 03:11:14.700
he's like,
stop picking your fucking nose music.
What are you curious?

2943
03:11:14.900 --> 03:11:16.050
Cause you don't just pick your nose,

2944
03:11:16.051 --> 03:11:18.630
you pick your nose and then you wipe that shit on my stuff.

2945
03:11:18.690 --> 03:11:20.190
You put net booger on my couch.

2946
03:11:20.270 --> 03:11:23.950
I'm sick of finding your boogers on my fucking couch and we're all so high like

2947
03:11:23.960 --> 03:11:27.420
get over itself man.
It was the funniest thing to see it.

2948
03:11:27.460 --> 03:11:30.810
Like we're on the level,
we're just fucking party dudes.

2949
03:11:30.811 --> 03:11:33.840
And somebody finally freaked out about having a buggery couch like,
well great,

2950
03:11:33.910 --> 03:11:35.560
well look who's grown up.

2951
03:11:36.080 --> 03:11:39.620
I don't want his friends bloggers all over stuff

2952
03:11:41.550 --> 03:11:44.600
in your fridge and close the door real quick.
Hope,
hope your food tastes like,

2953
03:11:45.900 --> 03:11:49.470
well I think it's gross to have the designated area.

2954
03:11:51.170 --> 03:11:52.003
He

2955
03:11:53.890 --> 03:11:56.980
knows and then he'll roll and just throw them on.
The floor

2956
03:12:00.700 --> 03:12:01.533
subconscious

2957
03:12:02.100 --> 03:12:04.280
<v 0>like on an airplane,
just go and,</v>

2958
03:12:04.400 --> 03:12:08.040
<v 11>and then you don't,
you don't realize like,
Oh shit,</v>

2959
03:12:09.030 --> 03:12:09.870
<v 0>the deepest,</v>

2960
03:12:09.970 --> 03:12:14.130
I just absolute most impressive deep dig I've ever seen in public.

2961
03:12:14.340 --> 03:12:17.190
Was Christopher Lloyd on a plane?
Yeah.

2962
03:12:17.191 --> 03:12:21.000
I sat next to me and he did a full cleaning each sailor,

2963
03:12:21.180 --> 03:12:23.500
each nostril and the second knuckle.
Oh yeah.

2964
03:12:23.501 --> 03:12:27.660
And I did a full swirl and I was like,
he didn't give a fuck.
It was like,

2965
03:12:27.661 --> 03:12:31.140
it was partially like,
I wanted to think,
he was like,

2966
03:12:31.141 --> 03:12:34.560
do you know what the fuck I am?
Like,
I wish it was that.
And it was partially,

2967
03:12:34.561 --> 03:12:37.410
I think age too.
He's like,
I'm not getting up to bathroom cleaner

2968
03:12:37.440 --> 03:12:40.130
<v 11>towards the defense mechanism.
Like,
Hey,
are you critical blood?</v>

2969
03:12:41.160 --> 03:12:42.580
My leave him alone.
I live with

2970
03:12:44.980 --> 03:12:49.740
<v 0>defense mechanism.
He,
uh,
he definitely,
he went in there.
Gene.
Yeah.</v>

2971
03:12:49.800 --> 03:12:52.040
Good for him.
Yeah.
But we can't tell

2972
03:12:52.040 --> 03:12:56.980
<v 11>our kid not to or kids.
Oh,
I think I should some minor.</v>

2973
03:12:56.981 --> 03:13:01.370
That liquids rewarding feeling from it though.
It's so gratifying.

2974
03:13:01.620 --> 03:13:05.040
Scratch your ears with the car keys.
No,
almost.

2975
03:13:05.380 --> 03:13:07.850
If I had to pick between that and Orgasms,
I would probably,

2976
03:13:07.990 --> 03:13:10.100
I would probably go the key.

2977
03:13:10.220 --> 03:13:13.250
You're not afraid of bacteria being introduced into the ear canal.

2978
03:13:15.080 --> 03:13:17.200
Look where we're putting our fingers in her mouth.
Yeah.

2979
03:13:17.510 --> 03:13:22.220
Every established already in the show.
Yeah.
Have you ever,
Paul's,

2980
03:13:22.221 --> 03:13:23.300
are you free to getting back to,

2981
03:13:26.900 --> 03:13:30.740
have you ever called a long hair out of your butt hole along here?

2982
03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:36.730
Have you ever?
Never.
No,
of course.
Yeah,

2983
03:13:36.740 --> 03:13:40.190
of course.
It's so special.
That one's very special way it happens.

2984
03:13:40.191 --> 03:13:44.780
Rarely was in body and I don't know how either you pull it out or it gets,

2985
03:13:44.890 --> 03:13:45.970
then you must be in your pool.

2986
03:13:46.610 --> 03:13:51.610
What is this here that falls and every once in a while it's like in your

2987
03:13:51.681 --> 03:13:53.140
underwear.
You see,
cause you're,

2988
03:13:54.110 --> 03:13:59.110
somebody just made a joke about having a long hair that they're pulling out of

2989
03:13:59.461 --> 03:14:01.370
it.
I remember wiping my ass and time and be like,

2990
03:14:01.640 --> 03:14:04.100
how did this fucking three foot hair and up in here?

2991
03:14:04.280 --> 03:14:08.530
It's definitely from just hair collecting coming around.

2992
03:14:08.760 --> 03:14:13.420
Yeah,
yeah,
definitely.
It's like now it's like in the Zeitgeists or just

2993
03:14:18.500 --> 03:14:22.300
before it starts.
Yeah.
See where this is going.

2994
03:14:38.550 --> 03:14:42.170
So awesome.
That was the best thing I've ever seen.
Say that again.

2995
03:14:45.980 --> 03:14:46.930
I mean for the listeners,

2996
03:14:52.570 --> 03:14:57.570
it's somebody had just the chocolate fountain idea first,

2997
03:14:59.480 --> 03:15:00.313
right?

2998
03:15:01.010 --> 03:15:05.750
We're not going to put a doll to show the repercussions.

2999
03:15:07.850 --> 03:15:11.930
At least three people put this idea together.
For the listeners who don't have,

3000
03:15:12.500 --> 03:15:15.800
who are in their shame pain in the background.
This is a party,
man.

3001
03:15:16.880 --> 03:15:21.020
I didn't realize that there's people watching.
This is like a New Year's Eve.

3002
03:15:21.050 --> 03:15:23.180
Look at the people over there.
There's people there.

3003
03:15:23.540 --> 03:15:27.320
I did not see where is this a child's party?
Is there like games on the,
Oh yeah.

3004
03:15:27.321 --> 03:15:29.440
This could be a birthday party.
I didn't even realize that.

3005
03:15:36.140 --> 03:15:40.690
Whoa,
whoa.

3006
03:15:41.110 --> 03:15:43.810
Is it only slow motion?
It could

3007
03:15:46.510 --> 03:15:51.110
be made into a Gif.
Please have this try.

3008
03:15:51.120 --> 03:15:51.953
This is great

3009
03:15:57.510 --> 03:15:58.500
for people listening.

3010
03:15:58.830 --> 03:16:02.970
There's a guy farting into a chocolate fountain and the chocolate is sprayed

3011
03:16:02.971 --> 03:16:04.800
over a baby doll space.
Good.

3012
03:16:04.801 --> 03:16:08.540
Ask One last time is done with the chocolate fountain.
All right,

3013
03:16:08.800 --> 03:16:10.230
we're going to be doing a thing,

3014
03:16:10.620 --> 03:16:12.120
but you're not going to want to use the chocolate.

3015
03:16:13.320 --> 03:16:17.650
Has everybody gotten their fill
out?

3016
03:16:24.640 --> 03:16:29.300
One more time.
One more time.
One more time.
Blue Dan,

3017
03:16:29.310 --> 03:16:30.900
please.
All right.
Here we go,

3018
03:16:34.560 --> 03:16:39.290
man.
That's a monster fart.
Yeah.

3019
03:16:39.300 --> 03:16:41.400
That was really,
it was a real farm.

3020
03:16:41.420 --> 03:16:43.860
And now you understand why we make the big bucks right

3021
03:16:46.850 --> 03:16:49.490
now.
You understand you own a home,

3022
03:16:52.110 --> 03:16:53.430
you own property,

3023
03:16:55.320 --> 03:16:58.200
but you wouldn't believe we've been fired from to corporate sponsors.

3024
03:16:58.210 --> 03:17:02.940
Make Morton's steakhouse.

3025
03:17:04.200 --> 03:17:09.120
Morton's gave you the boot Martins game.
Mcdonald's took away a lot of money.

3026
03:17:09.390 --> 03:17:13.340
Something like that.
Then you legit was,
those were real spots.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

3027
03:17:13.380 --> 03:17:14.640
Well,
you know what happened with Mcdonald's,

3028
03:17:14.641 --> 03:17:18.390
I don't know if you can get Terry Mcdonald's is somebody at first make it

3029
03:17:18.410 --> 03:17:22.680
Mcdonald's.
Like we should sponsor this without ever watching a single.
Yeah.

3030
03:17:22.770 --> 03:17:27.730
But what happened was the first episode that they sponsored had a um,

3031
03:17:28.590 --> 03:17:32.300
basically kind of a groundbreaking,
um,

3032
03:17:32.700 --> 03:17:35.850
like an immediately immediate classic clip we thought.

3033
03:17:36.270 --> 03:17:40.800
And that was the clip that they were like,
we are not into your show.

3034
03:17:42.060 --> 03:17:42.421
And you know,

3035
03:17:42.421 --> 03:17:46.150
the person that got the sponsorship got fired too from the air force.

3036
03:17:46.770 --> 03:17:51.120
You want to get to the kids.
It's like you get to the kids.
This was the clip.

3037
03:17:51.180 --> 03:17:52.980
Okay,
well let's see.

3038
03:17:53.910 --> 03:17:57.520
<v 17>Hi there guys.
It's Pete again and I'm here to do a little video.</v>

3039
03:17:57.610 --> 03:18:01.870
I wanted to use this but by greeny toy that I bought this new one and I thought

3040
03:18:01.871 --> 03:18:02.704
I'd try that again.

3041
03:18:02.740 --> 03:18:07.030
And then I also wanted to try this step one did fuck sleep that has these like

3042
03:18:07.210 --> 03:18:10.000
massive bullets in him.
I haven't used it of course.

3043
03:18:10.001 --> 03:18:13.300
And then I went to look and they didn't send any better.

3044
03:18:13.301 --> 03:18:18.190
He so bad that I'm not going to be able to use the vibrating park cause he does

3045
03:18:18.191 --> 03:18:22.630
work in it right now.
I'm sure that's going to get me off.

3046
03:18:22.750 --> 03:18:27.310
He's a loose cannon
Cochran,

3047
03:18:27.440 --> 03:18:28.273
two bikes,

3048
03:18:29.370 --> 03:18:32.550
<v 11>doors,
man.
He lives with somebody.
Oh that's possible.
Yeah.</v>

3049
03:18:33.830 --> 03:18:38.540
<v 17>A friend of mine had one boyfriend,
double ended dude.</v>

3050
03:18:39.080 --> 03:18:42.810
So I really want to try this because I like fucking stuff.
Yeah.

3051
03:18:42.811 --> 03:18:46.700
At first I'm going to try and get this in my butt and then turn it out and it's

3052
03:18:46.701 --> 03:18:49.610
even this cool little cool.

3053
03:18:51.390 --> 03:18:52.240
That's cool.

3054
03:18:52.330 --> 03:18:57.330
It's got a nice texture to it and it's also cools your indigenous art in the

3055
03:18:57.371 --> 03:19:02.290
background.
Shame are you bring those right here.

3056
03:19:02.560 --> 03:19:03.310
So

3057
03:19:03.310 --> 03:19:07.420
<v 11>Mcdonald's side is this
they,</v>

3058
03:19:07.640 --> 03:19:09.410
they were citing his hand movement,
which I was like,

3059
03:19:09.411 --> 03:19:11.960
I think he's his leg itches and they were like,
no,
it doesn't.

3060
03:19:12.310 --> 03:19:16.300
If he's like Mcdonald's went through this framework,
well they call it,

3061
03:19:16.480 --> 03:19:20.150
it's this moment that God,
I swear the s and p g with,
they were like,

3062
03:19:20.270 --> 03:19:21.770
what the hell?
First off,

3063
03:19:22.010 --> 03:19:25.790
he swears a couple times also he's jamming things in his asshole.

3064
03:19:28.630 --> 03:19:30.310
Is it off brand?
It's a little off.

3065
03:19:34.130 --> 03:19:34.963
<v 17>Go ahead.</v>

3066
03:19:40.520 --> 03:19:44.990
<v 11>Real Chicago.
Johnny Milwaukee here.
Try not butt plugs.</v>

3067
03:19:45.350 --> 03:19:48.650
It's got an ace cackling wraps around and goes up your ass.
Feels pretty good.

3068
03:19:49.950 --> 03:19:54.600
You Julian made in the USA so that's got that going forward to be proud of.

3069
03:19:58.390 --> 03:20:02.480
<v 17>Yeah.
Oh,
the eye contact.</v>

3070
03:20:04.330 --> 03:20:08.130
He's like looking off
but toy Bendigo

3071
03:20:15.800 --> 03:20:17.770
before we play

3072
03:20:19.580 --> 03:20:24.530
the slow driver.
Shit
go too fast.

3073
03:20:24.590 --> 03:20:28.640
Don't go too fast and a little hurt to try it again.
And Trust me,

3074
03:20:31.100 --> 03:20:35.900
once you get used to it
and relax yourself,

3075
03:20:36.760 --> 03:20:41.580
but play can be a lot of fun to get the car for now.

3076
03:20:44.760 --> 03:20:48.480
It feels pretty comfortable in there.
It,
it

3077
03:20:50.620 --> 03:20:52.400
is a tan line.
Yeah.

3078
03:20:57.380 --> 03:21:01.230
This is what killed us in the end.
And you're turning down,

3079
03:21:04.730 --> 03:21:09.730
turning down,
and it just cycles through the steps,
so,
oh,

3080
03:21:12.040 --> 03:21:15.160
that's just a constant.
Yeah.

3081
03:21:16.720 --> 03:21:21.560
Well that's even higher.
Yeah.
That's like a throbbing.

3082
03:21:25.520 --> 03:21:30.080
<v 11>Yeah.
Uh,
but then are go ahead and jump to the,</v>

3083
03:21:30.081 --> 03:21:31.570
I got it.
I got it.
Thanks.

3084
03:21:32.640 --> 03:21:37.260
<v 17>Opening.
This is what ended it here.
Alright.
Wow.</v>

3085
03:21:37.860 --> 03:21:40.420
Well that's pretty tight.
I wasn't expecting that.

3086
03:21:48.500 --> 03:21:52.810
<v 12>Oh,
fuck it.
Oh fuck,
fuck,
fuck,
fuck.
Ah,</v>

3087
03:21:54.020 --> 03:21:57.970
AH,
dammit.
Ooh,

3088
03:21:57.971 --> 03:21:59.240
look at his age.

3089
03:22:04.980 --> 03:22:05.813
Dammit.

3090
03:22:06.000 --> 03:22:07.830
<v 11>There you go.
And then Mcdonald's was like,
no.</v>

3091
03:22:11.140 --> 03:22:13.160
Yeah,
that's a chimp two point $3 million.

3092
03:22:16.230 --> 03:22:20.170
Was that,
was that real?
That does two points.
Two point $3 million.

3093
03:22:20.171 --> 03:22:24.640
We lost because of that.
Well,
yeah.
Oh,
I'm fixing it.
I'm you and you don't worry.

3094
03:22:24.641 --> 03:22:29.290
Okay.
All right.
Was it worth it?
Uh,
no,
no,

3095
03:22:31.610 --> 03:22:34.750
no.
But you know what?
The show has integrity and

3096
03:22:36.430 --> 03:22:40.690
we keep it real on this show.
We honor the listeners.

3097
03:22:41.500 --> 03:22:44.420
2.3 2.3 hours for that.

3098
03:22:44.440 --> 03:22:47.130
But this guy's gonna cram a thing up his ass.

3099
03:22:48.840 --> 03:22:49.900
You fucking idiot.

3100
03:22:52.630 --> 03:22:55.420
Now what do you think that broke and Morton Straw.

3101
03:22:55.480 --> 03:22:58.690
What was the play that clip enough?
No.
Yeah,

3102
03:23:00.250 --> 03:23:02.650
Morton's was just like a,
you know,
they,

3103
03:23:02.651 --> 03:23:07.400
they gave us some money and then they,
they $2,000.
No,

3104
03:23:07.401 --> 03:23:09.460
all those are the more,
but that was for the paint job,

3105
03:23:09.461 --> 03:23:12.730
but then they were doing a little other stuff and then they just said,

3106
03:23:12.731 --> 03:23:15.400
we're not fitting the brand objective.
How did,

3107
03:23:15.960 --> 03:23:19.240
how do they get past the first step?
I don't know.

3108
03:23:19.300 --> 03:23:23.740
It's just complete ignorance.
Yeah,
I think so.
Yeah.
I think so.

3109
03:23:24.420 --> 03:23:28.990
I'd love some of that ignorance to throw some money my way.
Yeah.

3110
03:23:30.930 --> 03:23:34.240
Did you get any of the Mcdonald's money or was it all well,
no,

3111
03:23:34.241 --> 03:23:37.720
we had to give it back.
I know.

3112
03:23:37.721 --> 03:23:42.050
And Tom had purchased it or did you get,
did you get well,

3113
03:23:42.051 --> 03:23:43.210
I ordered a Lamborghini.

3114
03:23:48.060 --> 03:23:52.120
It's touted stupid.
So dumb.

3115
03:23:52.420 --> 03:23:54.540
You ordered a Lamborghini?
Yeah,

3116
03:23:54.590 --> 03:23:57.340
but I had to cancel the order with Mcdonald's money.

3117
03:23:58.180 --> 03:24:01.030
But you lost it because of the clip of the guys.

3118
03:24:01.690 --> 03:24:06.550
Fuck sock hurting him.
Yeah.
It wasn't even,
he came too fast.
It wasn't,

3119
03:24:06.780 --> 03:24:10.450
was that what it was?
I thought he was getting hurt.
You know,
he came,
came,

3120
03:24:10.600 --> 03:24:14.590
oh I thought it was hurting his dick.
No,
no.
He had an orgasm and he's like,

3121
03:24:14.620 --> 03:24:18.760
oh fuck.
And then he,
yeah.
Oh I thought he was clearly being electrocuted.
Mild.

3122
03:24:19.330 --> 03:24:22.930
No,
that would have been different if you a wish.

3123
03:24:23.380 --> 03:24:26.660
I hate if you wanted to hear it in slow motion here.
No.

3124
03:24:39.840 --> 03:24:41.260
Is any of this real,

3125
03:24:44.130 --> 03:24:47.520
<v 13>why is your life,
what are your lives now?
There's,</v>

3126
03:24:50.740 --> 03:24:51.573
yeah.

3127
03:24:51.960 --> 03:24:56.960
Did you tell them at the Lamborghini dealership why you had to cancel the order?

3128
03:24:58.320 --> 03:25:01.330
Um,
uh,
I didn't get into the actual details.

3129
03:25:01.350 --> 03:25:03.660
I feel if there's ever a time to get into the details

3130
03:25:05.960 --> 03:25:07.470
cause I was like,
I told her,
I was like,

3131
03:25:07.471 --> 03:25:12.460
I should get like some crazy exotic car just for fun.
And then no,

3132
03:25:12.480 --> 03:25:16.890
for practical reasons.
And,
uh,
this was before the Mcdonald's.
She was like,

3133
03:25:16.891 --> 03:25:20.550
that's stupid.
And then when the Mcdonald's money came through,

3134
03:25:20.551 --> 03:25:24.370
it just felt like it was gravy.
So then I was like,
no,
it's fine.
Right?

3135
03:25:24.490 --> 03:25:29.490
Cause like I guess so then I ordered it but now I'm going to get some jewelry.

3136
03:25:29.491 --> 03:25:31.540
Right.
We're going to do that.
I don't know Tom.

3137
03:25:31.541 --> 03:25:36.000
I think we should press pause on edge.
The jewelry.
He wants to get chains,

3138
03:25:36.270 --> 03:25:38.160
gold chains for his 40th birthday.

3139
03:25:40.910 --> 03:25:45.540
I know Kyle will support this idea.
Both asshole.

3140
03:25:48.180 --> 03:25:49.320
But you're doing it right.

3141
03:25:53.010 --> 03:25:56.780
God change.
I'm sure your heart's broken,

3142
03:25:58.980 --> 03:26:01.320
but that guy fuck away your Lamborghini money.

3143
03:26:07.160 --> 03:26:11.820
Let's say my name with disdain.
What do you like?
What,
what is,

3144
03:26:12.200 --> 03:26:16.350
what would be the soldier?
I don't even,
I,

3145
03:26:16.370 --> 03:26:18.690
I got seven remote control cars.

3146
03:26:20.640 --> 03:26:24.220
That's what I do for fun.
But I mean like,

3147
03:26:25.200 --> 03:26:29.610
like right now Mcdonald's calls you up and they go,
hey,
we heard you on.

3148
03:26:29.880 --> 03:26:32.730
Thanks for speaking some sensors,
3 million,
whatever you do.

3149
03:26:33.640 --> 03:26:38.640
Like keep stuff out of the buttons for two point $3 million.

3150
03:26:39.500 --> 03:26:42.000
Well we didn't even get that warning.
Yeah.

3151
03:26:42.270 --> 03:26:46.350
They told us a gym maybe infer that McDonald's wouldn't go for

3152
03:26:48.150 --> 03:26:48.730
a they,

3153
03:26:48.730 --> 03:26:53.730
they're like Mcdonald and what their offer was before 2.3 250,000.

3154
03:26:58.100 --> 03:27:02.890
Ha.
I Dunno.
That's how stupid.
This is crazy.
I was like,
no,

3155
03:27:03.760 --> 03:27:07.300
I don't want to do it.
I won't have Mcdonald's need more.
All right here,

3156
03:27:07.330 --> 03:27:12.020
watch this.
Wait for like a month.
Well,

3157
03:27:12.670 --> 03:27:16.750
if Mcdonald's is listening now,
just like if you got any of that 2.3 million,

3158
03:27:17.700 --> 03:27:22.110
I'll take like,
oh I don't,
I don't have,
I don't know what I'd want to do.

3159
03:27:23.190 --> 03:27:28.150
I don't know.
I think I,
but I don't,
I can't even think of it.
Like,

3160
03:27:28.151 --> 03:27:33.110
are you at that point that either of you grow up with money?
No.
Yeah,

3161
03:27:33.960 --> 03:27:38.770
a little bit.
A little bit.
But to think like,
oh,
just,

3162
03:27:40.060 --> 03:27:42.550
I can't even put myself in headspace.
Like I'm fine now,

3163
03:27:42.580 --> 03:27:44.140
but it just sitting in the bank cause I'm like,

3164
03:27:44.920 --> 03:27:49.330
this isn't a real thing what I do.
So the money doesn't feel,

3165
03:27:49.660 --> 03:27:52.870
it feels like,
it's like,
like a mob thing.
Like you robbed a bank,

3166
03:27:52.871 --> 03:27:57.700
like don't spend it.
People know.
Yeah.
But you don't enjoy it,

3167
03:27:58.350 --> 03:28:02.080
you know?
I know.
I'm not trying to be humble.
It's like there's nothing.

3168
03:28:02.420 --> 03:28:03.340
I know I feel the same.

3169
03:28:03.460 --> 03:28:07.060
There's nothing I have like given this stuff I do have that's like I suck at

3170
03:28:07.061 --> 03:28:07.894
guitar,
but I,

3171
03:28:07.960 --> 03:28:11.080
I bought some guitars that are nice and I like looking at it as fun.

3172
03:28:11.170 --> 03:28:12.003
Then that's it.
Like,

3173
03:28:12.070 --> 03:28:14.980
Oh this is a cool guitar and then I play it and like put it down.
You're not,

3174
03:28:15.010 --> 03:28:15.940
don't embarrass yourself.

3175
03:28:17.160 --> 03:28:22.160
I got some good mountain bikes that I got a big jeep with monster truck tires.

3176
03:28:23.580 --> 03:28:25.270
That's a dumb thing.
But I do this shit with it.

3177
03:28:25.271 --> 03:28:28.420
I go bang it up in a desert and everything.
That's cool.
So yeah,
just go.

3178
03:28:28.990 --> 03:28:30.610
I was wanting to know when you get something like that,

3179
03:28:30.611 --> 03:28:34.780
like how do you know where to go?
There's like there's a OHV spots like off road,

3180
03:28:34.840 --> 03:28:35.710
off highway vehicles,

3181
03:28:35.711 --> 03:28:40.390
spots out in like Gorman's one but I'll go to Anza Borrego down south.

3182
03:28:40.391 --> 03:28:43.630
I've been to Utah with,
it had been a Denver with it.
Let's put some miles on it.

3183
03:28:43.631 --> 03:28:45.880
Just just being out out in the world,

3184
03:28:46.180 --> 03:28:49.720
sitting out in a camping and shitting and shitting in the ground,

3185
03:28:50.570 --> 03:28:54.520
that chiefs like good shit in the ground without any legal ramifications.

3186
03:28:54.580 --> 03:28:57.280
That is good.
But like I don't like,
I don't,
but I didn't buy a house or anything.

3187
03:28:57.370 --> 03:28:59.560
Like I could buy a house,
but I'm like,
pardon me?

3188
03:28:59.890 --> 03:29:03.490
Likes that I could do comedy without knowing there's nothing they can take away

3189
03:29:03.491 --> 03:29:07.200
from me if I stopped doing comedy,
like I don't know the bank,
anything.

3190
03:29:07.210 --> 03:29:10.010
I know I owe no money,
so if I'm like,
you know what I want,

3191
03:29:10.070 --> 03:29:13.930
I don't want to do anything for a year,
I can do that without worrying about,

3192
03:29:14.770 --> 03:29:19.670
so maybe that's what I bought his freedom.
Yeah,
that's huge.
But doing anything,

3193
03:29:20.110 --> 03:29:23.980
I'm going to take a year off.
I sit on the couch,
watch binge watch the Americans.

3194
03:29:23.981 --> 03:29:26.650
That's all I'm doing.
I'm not doing it.
That's good though because when you're,

3195
03:29:26.651 --> 03:29:30.430
I mean that's,
what have you taken?
Did you take this past year off those fine?
No,

3196
03:29:30.431 --> 03:29:32.380
I didn't.
I left.
I'll take like a month off here and there.

3197
03:29:32.410 --> 03:29:34.360
That's going to go drive around and fuck off.

3198
03:29:34.600 --> 03:29:37.390
That's dependent on the ladies work schedule.
All December.

3199
03:29:37.391 --> 03:29:41.820
We were traveling and everything.
You wouldn't have be,

3200
03:29:42.820 --> 03:29:46.720
well,
that was a couple.
That was two years ago.
I was doing my show.

3201
03:29:46.721 --> 03:29:50.740
And then you announced,
you're shown the guide book and my show.
He's like,
well,

3202
03:29:52.960 --> 03:29:55.270
don't worry about it.
That Tom show is going to be real good too,

3203
03:29:55.271 --> 03:29:58.740
but we'll get a couple people.
We'll get a couple of people please,

3204
03:30:00.020 --> 03:30:05.010
please.
Okay.
I want to go back to the Lamborghini.
Yeah.

3205
03:30:06.110 --> 03:30:10.570
Orange.
It's embarrassing.
What is your car?

3206
03:30:11.020 --> 03:30:15.600
I don't give a fuck about cars.
No.
What is your car right now?
Okay.
Yeah.

3207
03:30:16.270 --> 03:30:19.780
Jeep jeep.
Like wrangler.
You have a jeep grand Cherokee.

3208
03:30:21.190 --> 03:30:25.130
The Porsche,
yeah.
Yeah,
but do you have another car too?

3209
03:30:25.900 --> 03:30:30.480
What's the other car?
It's a beamer.
Yeah.
And I got another card here.

3210
03:30:31.810 --> 03:30:34.030
What's the other car?
It's for the family.

3211
03:30:37.070 --> 03:30:40.670
What's the for the ambulance.

You got four?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well I got five.
Yeah.

3213
03:30:49.340 --> 03:30:53.670
I don't feel bad about this Lamborghini thing fallen through.
Yeah.

3214
03:30:53.990 --> 03:30:56.180
I hope you have no money for your children's.

3215
03:31:00.170 --> 03:31:04.480
<v 11>Can you make her worry?
No,</v>

3216
03:31:04.660 --> 03:31:08.470
we're going to get that new steakhouse sponsor anymore.
Nice.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Hey,

3217
03:31:08.471 --> 03:31:12.400
by the way,
I put 20 bucks in the kids' college fund life lesson.

3218
03:31:12.490 --> 03:31:16.210
We got norms coming through a free meals for us and the kids whenever we need

3219
03:31:16.211 --> 03:31:19.120
them.
That's the sponsorship we got.
And I will say Morton's,

3220
03:31:19.390 --> 03:31:22.930
we didn't get free food.
Mcdonald's gave us free.
Yeah.
Morton's,

3221
03:31:22.931 --> 03:31:25.090
they only gave us employee discount.

3222
03:31:25.900 --> 03:31:30.100
So that was the drink three drinks.
You Bury barium anyway.
Yeah.

3223
03:31:30.250 --> 03:31:35.020
<v 13>Yeah.
So yeah,
I still eat there.</v>

3224
03:31:35.400 --> 03:31:36.280
Pay Full price.

3225
03:31:37.270 --> 03:31:40.980
What do you think I should ask for money wise from the next sponsor?
My head.

3226
03:31:40.990 --> 03:31:45.290
Don't talk to me about this shit.
I just want to get your yeah,

3227
03:31:45.291 --> 03:31:48.550
well show them that clip first

3228
03:31:50.350 --> 03:31:53.380
and then work on a realistic amount.

3229
03:31:54.040 --> 03:31:56.740
Like you realize your money's going to be behind this.
Right?

3230
03:31:57.040 --> 03:31:59.650
And that way they're not pulling it out for Monday.
Yeah.

3233
03:32:08.020 --> 03:32:12.370

03:32:45.910 --> 03:32:49.000
<v 13>Boogie Monster.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it's you and Dave guys.</v>

3244
03:32:49.001 --> 03:32:50.650
If you think this podcast is stupid,

3245
03:32:50.651 --> 03:32:54.310
you should check out the boogie monster with cow Canadian and Dave Stone.

3246
03:32:54.490 --> 03:32:58.470
There you go.
You guys are doing it a while.
Yeah,
a couple of years.
It's just,

3247
03:32:58.480 --> 03:33:01.750
it's just us goofing off as a way to like plug babes and everything.
Yeah,

3248
03:33:01.780 --> 03:33:06.030
it's perfect.
Yeah.
We screw off.
I don't have the multimedia functions.
Yeah.

3249
03:33:06.130 --> 03:33:09.550
So we can,
we can react to watching shit videos on our phones,

3250
03:33:09.580 --> 03:33:13.120
but then nobody else knows what's going on.
Right.
Which isn't for good listening,

3251
03:33:13.150 --> 03:33:16.620
but like think about how great that Chocolate Fountain Fart was.
You know,
smell.

3252
03:33:16.630 --> 03:33:20.630
I'm seeing like the appeal of a multimedia.
Yeah.
Yeah.

3253
03:33:22.570 --> 03:33:26.410
<v 11>That was the best moment of my life.
Yeah.
Hot for fun.
That was really hard.
Yeah.</v>

3254
03:33:26.460 --> 03:33:29.630
<v 13>Car Fine.
Yeah,
it was.
It was great.
It was great.</v>

3255
03:33:29.880 --> 03:33:32.910
She wasn't even open yet.
No,
I know.

3256
03:33:33.120 --> 03:33:34.930
I mean if there was a reason to celebrate

3257
03:33:35.420 --> 03:33:38.280
<v 11>how disgusting is a chocolate?
I,</v>

3258
03:33:38.300 --> 03:33:40.740
let's think about it from a hygienic perspective.

3259
03:33:40.950 --> 03:33:44.670
Like you're dipping in your food and then your fingers are in it and then the

3260
03:33:44.671 --> 03:33:47.250
chocolate just gets recycled.
Right.
Like a fountain.

3261
03:33:47.251 --> 03:33:50.970
It's nasty already a chocolate fan.
It's nasty.
Yeah.

3262
03:33:51.200 --> 03:33:54.600
That's what the guy with his assets was.
This thing's nasty already.

3263
03:33:59.160 --> 03:34:03.330
Why on the child's face y'all eat none of this gross

3264
03:34:06.350 --> 03:34:09.610
man.
That is awesome.
We got to do that for our kids birthday.

3265
03:34:11.430 --> 03:34:12.780
Can I hire this guy for

3266
03:34:15.710 --> 03:34:19.510
a kid at the party?
Let me see your

3267
03:34:21.990 --> 03:34:22.823
why

3268
03:34:28.570 --> 03:34:29.580
you're already sticky.

3269
03:34:32.160 --> 03:34:35.190
If you look at the baby's expression now too.
It kind of really

3270
03:34:39.150 --> 03:34:42.330
Chicago accent.
What am I saying?
Let's say you could try me.

3271
03:34:42.430 --> 03:34:46.750
Fatso you could try me.
Fatso yeah,

3272
03:34:47.390 --> 03:34:48.970
for the board.

3273
03:34:52.660 --> 03:34:57.660
It's Casino Casino will be here tomorrow was like,

3274
03:35:00.211 --> 03:35:04.630
you fucking try me.
Fatso and then he pulls his pants up.
Where's that as I want.

3275
03:35:04.631 --> 03:35:09.060
He's like beaten up don Rickles.
No,
it's a,
it's when he goes over to Sam's house.

3276
03:35:09.490 --> 03:35:14.160
Deniro.
Oh,
that's right.
That's right.
He's like,
I'm going to come there tomorrow.

3277
03:35:14.340 --> 03:35:17.730
I'm going to get my fucking money.
You can't talk to me like that.
It's like,

3278
03:35:17.731 --> 03:35:22.030
nevermind Sam.
We'll come back.

3279
03:35:22.031 --> 03:35:26.680
Can I go to jail?
Cause I'm stupid.
Yeah.
So fun.

3280
03:35:27.420 --> 03:35:31.770
She up to,

He's in that movie.
He's in that new movie.

3281
03:35:31.771 --> 03:35:33.370
They're doing Scorsese.

3282
03:35:33.400 --> 03:35:37.510
He's doing another movie about Jimmy Hoffa and he's got a part in.
Oh Shit.
Yeah,

3283
03:35:37.710 --> 03:35:42.660
of course.
Mr Canadian.
It was so fun having you.

3284
03:35:42.661 --> 03:35:44.390
Will you tell me where can people see?

3285
03:35:44.400 --> 03:35:47.970
Do you have any dates lined up or anything coming up?
Royal Oak,

3286
03:35:47.971 --> 03:35:49.560
Michigan at the end of the month.

3287
03:35:49.561 --> 03:35:54.050
I think I'm not good with the website.

3288
03:35:54.540 --> 03:35:58.580
It's my name.
Kyle.
That's a good one,
right?
Yeah.

3289
03:35:59.270 --> 03:36:02.310
I got all the dates up there.
Okay.
I do podcast stuff.

3290
03:36:02.550 --> 03:36:07.100
K.

A.
N.
E.
Sure.
Yeah.
Put it in the graphic guys.
Do Graphics.
You,

3291
03:36:07.130 --> 03:36:09.360
do you do the Twitter up their twitters

3292
03:36:11.700 --> 03:36:14.940
or am I just doing this?
Yeah,
there's a good graphic.
Throw his phone number up.

3293
03:36:14.970 --> 03:36:18.600
I'll give it to you.
Social Security.

3294
03:36:20.820 --> 03:36:23.670
No,
thanks for coming,
man.
I'm glad we finally get this fun.
Yeah,

3295
03:36:23.671 --> 03:36:26.310
it was a lot of fun.
Can we play out with the chocolate part one more time?

3296
03:36:26.540 --> 03:36:29.190
Can I didn't know where to look the first time I would look at the fountain or

3297
03:36:29.191 --> 03:36:31.770
the,
but I want to look at the baby this time.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
go ahead.

3298
03:36:39.100 --> 03:36:42.370
That is stupid.
That was a mistake to look at.
The baby's face.

3299
03:36:44.260 --> 03:36:49.210
That dead.
I'd stare of a child's toy being desecrated.
Powerful.

3300
03:36:49.211 --> 03:36:53.380
That far it is.
If that bottom layer of the fountain has still has a hole in it,

3301
03:36:53.410 --> 03:36:54.130
look at that.

3302
03:36:54.130 --> 03:36:58.540
Look at the power of this park that's two layers of a chocolate fountain.
He no,

3303
03:36:58.541 --> 03:37:01.900
you're right.
That's not your habits as far as like he was one,

3304
03:37:01.910 --> 03:37:05.620
never seen something like it's a good for the obsec the exception of the baby

3305
03:37:05.621 --> 03:37:09.760
powder thing with the farts.
Right.
Never seen how far would impact.
Yeah.

3306
03:37:10.510 --> 03:37:12.520
So this is my first reference for something.
I mean,

3307
03:37:12.521 --> 03:37:16.000
look at how good he's doing right now.
I mean that's good work.

3308
03:37:16.090 --> 03:37:20.640
That's a multilayer fart top and bottom there.
I liked seeing the,
uh,

3309
03:37:20.830 --> 03:37:23.300
the heat sensor farts when someone's parts and on for red.

3310
03:37:23.730 --> 03:37:28.730
I would love to see like what that like I would do that and for myself,

3311
03:37:29.320 --> 03:37:32.790
I would want to know.
Yeah.
I fired up the car so bad they were today.

3312
03:37:32.830 --> 03:37:34.090
I thought I hit something.

3313
03:37:36.740 --> 03:37:40.330
It smelled like I ran over a possum or something.
It was bad.

3314
03:37:40.870 --> 03:37:42.190
It just stayed in the car.

3315
03:37:42.330 --> 03:37:45.220
Like I rolled down my own windows and how that show got worse.

3316
03:37:45.250 --> 03:37:48.730
Like I wasn't getting worse.
I feel like my farts are lingering more these days.

3317
03:37:48.930 --> 03:37:52.510
The older you get,
you're growing into being a dad.
Yeah.

3318
03:37:52.570 --> 03:37:56.260
In your farts are worse and your body's breaking down your poison.

3319
03:37:56.261 --> 03:38:00.730
You're turning down Melad death.
Death.
It is,
dude.

3320
03:38:00.731 --> 03:38:01.960
Check out this Ferrari.
I got in the back.

3321
03:38:03.020 --> 03:38:07.120
It's right back here when I burp the other day.
And you were like,

3322
03:38:07.810 --> 03:38:11.590
it was Korean food.
Oh,
that was the most disgusting thing ever.

3323
03:38:12.160 --> 03:38:15.820
We had a Korean,
you know ribs and Kelby.
Oh,
barbecue.

3324
03:38:15.940 --> 03:38:19.540
It's my fo and then she was like herb and burped and then she was like,

3325
03:38:19.541 --> 03:38:22.270
so am I going to,
I was like,
Holy Shit.

3326
03:38:22.750 --> 03:38:25.360
It actually smelled like she farted out of her mouth.

3327
03:38:25.361 --> 03:38:28.600
It didn't smell like a bird.
If I,
if I a barbecue and I burp and it's like,

3328
03:38:28.601 --> 03:38:33.160
this is just dead.
It's dead things.
Yeah.
It was like this smells like a cemetery.

3329
03:38:33.550 --> 03:38:37.690
Terrible.
And the garlic and they can't,
garlic is what set it over the top.

3330
03:38:38.070 --> 03:38:40.840
Yeah.
All right.
Check out my McLaren.
We're going to roll that out.

3331
03:38:42.310 --> 03:38:44.170
Thank you very much,
