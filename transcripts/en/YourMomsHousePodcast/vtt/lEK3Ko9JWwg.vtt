00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.550
That's my not my dad.

77
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.230
<v 2>There is all this gossip going on about me and Selena Gomez and I have been</v>

78
00:05:25.021 --> 00:05:27.480
laughing the whole time.

79
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.760
<v 3>Don't bring anyone loving</v>

80
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.023
Christina.

81
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.200
<v 4>We want to get drunk.</v>

82
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.903
That was a little loud.

83
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.830
<v 1>Wait Til I get my drum set.
Oh my God.
What a great idea.
Yeah.</v>

84
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.840
Where are you going to play him?
I Dunno.

85
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.740
I'll put them next to my turntables and just kind of go back and forth.

86
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.130
How about in the baby's room?
You know,
you always joke like that,

87
00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:42.200
that everything we get has to be in the baby's room.

88
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:46.400
Why can't I set him up somewhere else where I'm in that sitting room downstairs?

89
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.270
Yeah.
That sounds like fun.

90
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.810
<v 4>You know?
What do you think?</v>

91
00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.173
Yeah.

92
00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.570
<v 1>I don't want a dream crusher so far.
Everything that I say,
I want to do it.</v>

93
00:07:01.571 --> 00:07:06.480
You go like,
Oh God,
yeah,
you got it.

94
00:07:06.481 --> 00:07:09.730
I'm just that dream crusher wife.
Yeah.
I never say no to you.

95
00:07:09.731 --> 00:07:13.440
So that's my turntables.
Oh,
that's different.
Why is that different?

96
00:07:13.441 --> 00:07:17.640
Here is the only reason I discourage Dj,
uh,
Dad Mouth,

97
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.870
Dj poly by dad mouth is because you've already got a successful career in

98
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:26.630
Stanhope and now you're going to embark on a second career.
Yeah.
Yeah.

99
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.560
Hey Hitler.
Okay.
Yeah.

100
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.240
Are you saying why does it have to be a career and not like something I just

101
00:07:33.241 --> 00:07:38.190
enjoy doing?
I again,
yeah,
go ahead.
You're always like,
you already have a career,

102
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.230
right,
so why can't I do it for not a career for you can do,

103
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.710
do whatever the fuck you want and no one cares and you're looking in the baby.

104
00:07:43.711 --> 00:07:47.140
You're going to leave.
We're going to go down and see what,
why.

105
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.990
Nobody wants to hear you DJ in the House and just if I want to do,

106
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.090
nobody wants it,

107
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:55.440
but I want Dj was just headphones on quietly and another house.

108
00:07:55.441 --> 00:07:58.680
That would be fine.
We don't have to go to another house.
I want to hear if,
again,

109
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.740
I'm not going to put it on a huge speakers.
Why?
Yeah,

110
00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:07.070
why can't listen with my headphones on.
Okay.
Yeah.
God,
you're stuck.

111
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.820
You are such a dream crusher.
What?
Dream crushed city right here.

112
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.823
<v 4>Okay.</v>

113
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:17.910
<v 1>Seriously.
It's really,
really bad.
No,
I'm going to get a drum set.
Okay.</v>

114
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.240
Where do you want me to put it?
In your bedroom?
Yeah,
sure.
Hey,

115
00:08:21.241 --> 00:08:25.650
what's up with this guy?
Oh,
I got it.
Wait,
that's wrong.

116
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:32.490
My headphones fell off.
Do you want to have to shit right now?

117
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.220
Do you have?
What?
Can we do this show or do you need to take your shirt?

118
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:40.270
<v 2>There's all this gossip going on about me and Selena Gomez and I have been</v>

119
00:08:40.841 --> 00:08:43.270
laughing the whole time.

120
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.790
<v 1>That's awesome.
Yeah,
that's neat.
That's really great.
What is that?</v>

121
00:08:51.791 --> 00:08:56.280
Why is that happening to me?
I didn't even know what is,
what's that?
What happens?

122
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.270
Well,
you know should happen sometimes.
Speaking of Shit,

123
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:04.650
do you have to shit now or can we do our show?
I know you shit 20 times a day.

124
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:07.530
I don't know if this,
this show impedes on your shitting schedule.

125
00:09:07.531 --> 00:09:11.160
What do you think of your dad and Selena Gomez?
Not My dad.

126
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.360
<v 5>I mean it's harmless.</v>

127
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.960
I keep telling Selena not to worry about it.

128
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:21.423
I mean,
yeah.

129
00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.460
<v 1>How creepy is this guy though?
I don't like him as,</v>

130
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.930
isn't she like a teenager or early twenties or something where she's not

131
00:09:28.931 --> 00:09:30.370
interested in that guy?
You don't think so?

132
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:35.530
The way that he holds his microphone and he makes us like,
it's annoying to me.

133
00:09:35.531 --> 00:09:38.650
I think he's in,
I think he's annoying.
It's one of those things like,

134
00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.080
I will not let you blow me.

135
00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:44.140
Like he's just making attention.

136
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.150
<v 5>I want to talk about you.
Good or bad.</v>

137
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:52.200
If a person gets mad,
they get teased more.
I mean,

138
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.880
me and Selena are famous so I don't talk anyway.

139
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.430
Then my 14 year old son Jacob Harris gets jealous and mad,

140
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.770
so I have to settle him down.

141
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.770
<v 1>One of the things I think would be really funny though is to make a video like</v>

142
00:10:10.771 --> 00:10:12.930
this.
If your kid is being an asshole.
Yeah,

143
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:17.450
because imagine how upset his son if his son is a dick and he goes,
all right,

144
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:21.930
I'm just sick of you being like this,
and he starts posting videos like this.

145
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.680
Imagine what a 14 year old boy would do.
Terrible.

146
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.620
Do you remember poltergeist and that guy that God is at hand?
Oh,

147
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.360
that old man.
That's him.
I liked his guys laugh though.

148
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.420
<v 5>That's still him down.</v>

149
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:42.770
<v 6>Okay.</v>

150
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:47.770
<v 1>I could see you with a guy like that.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I do.</v>

151
00:10:47.771 --> 00:10:50.870
I sometimes I,
do you ever do that where you see people and you go,
oh,

152
00:10:50.871 --> 00:10:54.860
I could see my spouse with them.
I see.
I see that sometimes.
No,

153
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.820
actually I don't.
I just sickens me.

154
00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:02.360
If he were to be with another woman,
I would fucking kill both of you.
Well,

155
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:07.160
I see a guy like this and I go,
I see Christina and him living together.

156
00:11:07.161 --> 00:11:10.070
I see you guys making out like mouth smells so bad.

157
00:11:10.071 --> 00:11:13.310
He has a lot of plaque on his teeth.

158
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:18.140
He doesn't do even by yearly cleanings.
Yeah.
His mouth is,

159
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:22.310
it's accessible.
Yeah.
It's all yellow and it's all dad.

160
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.540
I bet his penis is not the same color as the rest of his skin.

161
00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:31.340
What?
I mean,
yeah.
What color do you think it is?

162
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:35.870
I think it's more yellow than his actual skin.
I think it's purple.
Oh really?

163
00:11:35.871 --> 00:11:38.180
Yeah.
Cause if you look at the rest of him,

164
00:11:38.181 --> 00:11:42.650
he's got a purpley tones to his disgusting gums and now it's usually the same

165
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:43.970
color as your penis.

166
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:49.240
I think he has a liver deficiency and that his penis and his testicles are

167
00:11:49.581 --> 00:11:50.414
yellow.

168
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:55.470
Now I go highlighter Yellow Hughes detectives.

169
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.700
I wish we could find out the answer to this mystery.

170
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:03.130
That's the thing we really need.
Never know.
Well,

171
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:06.370
so you say my friend.
So you say,

172
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.190
I think it's possible that we could find out,

173
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.710
but you gotta be up for the challenge.

174
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.400
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

175
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.160
<v 1>Yeah.
Don't burn broom broom.</v>

176
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.130
Can I tell you?

177
00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:35.180
I'm probably one of my nightmares is you getting guitar and then like Bam,

178
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.380
Bam.
I wrote this tune for Ya.
Listen,
listen.

179
00:12:38.381 --> 00:12:42.110
And then you make me listen to you play the guitar and saying kill me.

180
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:47.300
I'm real real Beverly hills surgeons.
Yeah.

181
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.191
Oh.

182
00:12:48.191 --> 00:12:53.191
And they had an outdoor thing and god is nothing worse than watching someone

183
00:12:53.771 --> 00:12:58.330
play the Acoustic Guitar and sing at you.
It makes me so uncomfortable.
God,

184
00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.410
God dammit.
And you have to act like that was really good.
Thank you.

185
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:07.480
I wrote this song,
they always tell you the rhyme and you know the history.

186
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:11.920
Um,
yeah.
One time a buddy of mine,

187
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.170
we went out to eat and uh,

188
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.540
we couldn't find what we wanted,
so I wrote the song.

189
00:13:19.541 --> 00:13:22.870
It's about sometimes you don't find what you want in life that you end up being

190
00:13:22.871 --> 00:13:27.340
happy with what you got.
Here we go.
It's kind of the rolling stones.
Um,

191
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.000
celebrity.
Nothing is worse than people.
Yeah.

192
00:13:31.001 --> 00:13:34.750
Who is a vocation is guitar singing and writing songs.

193
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.091
I had to buy it.

194
00:13:36.091 --> 00:13:39.160
I had a neighbor that lives underneath me when I was in my twenties that would

195
00:13:39.161 --> 00:13:43.000
sing and all night long and he would sing one song.

196
00:13:43.001 --> 00:13:44.630
So all you hear over and over,
it's okay.

197
00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:53.010
Like the same shit over there was no one wants to hear you practice your fucking

198
00:13:53.081 --> 00:13:56.700
music.
I think I found this moment still make me so excited.

199
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.353
Here we go.

200
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:07.630
<v 7>Pretend like you're jamming.
Like,
yeah,
I like</v>

201
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:11.540
<v 1>this song.
But I like the dad.
Dedication,</v>

202
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.690
dedication.
When it goes like,

203
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.860
this guy's my own.
Look how crazy.

204
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:30.640
When did he tell them what the songs are bark.
He comes home for a day or two.

205
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.820
It goes to for cell.
So this is a celebrity plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills.

206
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:38.620
The personal problem she,
she's going through,
which by the way,
oh,
here is one.

207
00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:42.790
They could have thought of a more imaginative name for the show instead of the

208
00:14:42.791 --> 00:14:44.950
celebrity plastic surgeons in Beverly Hills.

209
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.250
So they're all plastic surgeons by day and there were supposedly friends here.

210
00:14:48.251 --> 00:14:52.760
Right.
They have a practice together,
right?
They have a big practice.

211
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:57.080
Yeah.
Yeah.
Part of a group.
They're part of like a a surgeon's group.
Yeah.

212
00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:01.940
That's him.
So dad is a plastic surgeon my day and then,

213
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.253
yeah.

214
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:09.700
<v 9>But as a performer to like to make you feel good and to bring an energy and joy</v>

215
00:15:09.701 --> 00:15:12.320
to people.
That's why you're not really a performer.
I really want to know.

216
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.760
Real performer.
No.
Haley's mind off of,
oh boy.

217
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.510
The personal problem she's going through and escape.
Escape to the music.

218
00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.610
<v 1>What's so different about comedians and musicians?</v>

219
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:28.650
Because musicians can be really sincere about a song,
but like usually,

220
00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.620
but comedians don't go,
you know,
I really just,

221
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.270
my job is really to make it really well.
Some do,

222
00:15:36.271 --> 00:15:38.180
but not the good ones.
Yeah.
None of the good ones.
Yes.

223
00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.950
If your aim is to make other people happy as a comic,

224
00:15:40.951 --> 00:15:42.810
you're the shittiest comic dog shit.
Yeah.

225
00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.310
<v 9>Did your dog diarrhea</v>

226
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.990
the blondes?
What's wrong?

227
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:57.610
No rhythm the other day.
This is so painful.

228
00:15:57.611 --> 00:15:58.370
It's so hard.

229
00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.450
You have to stand there and get hammered and listen to your dumb friends plays

230
00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.230
hold all the good things.
And I remember he had a dedication.
And

231
00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:11.950
where is it?
Right?
Robert announces that he's leaving for Brazil?

232
00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.390
I don't think so.
Oh my God.
You know,

233
00:16:16.391 --> 00:16:20.440
and he's following his dreams and we definitely get to vent.

234
00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:24.730
Happiest are usually not so much shit.
Oh isn't this Scott?

235
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.110
How I know you guys are just here.
It's here.

236
00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:29.140
It's here and it's like a tearful moment,
you know?

237
00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:33.460
Do you want to move in with us?
You Love Daddy?
I don't have a daughter.
Yeah,

238
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.640
her life was here in Beverly Hills.
You know what?
Honestly,

239
00:16:36.641 --> 00:16:39.740
at the end of the day we are always here to like,
we love you.
Oh sure.

240
00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.270
At least when the cameras are rolling.
Yep.

241
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.710
Everybody's super skinny.
Come on Dad.
Tell us.

242
00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:52.600
We tell us how you came up with this number,
dude.
Maybe we,
no,
no,
I know.

243
00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:57.550
Just look,
it's going to talk their look
their way earlier.
All right.
Right,

244
00:16:57.551 --> 00:17:01.120
right.
I am all right.

245
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:06.100
The other side of me is like,
okay,
you're right.
You're right.
Sorry.
Sorry.

246
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:09.060
The search.
Um,
and the,
and the settings just beautiful.
It's on,

247
00:17:09.061 --> 00:17:12.110
it's on mountain top with,
with this reservoir.

248
00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:16.920
But low was the whole city and the Osha scarf distance and I'm looking forward

249
00:17:16.921 --> 00:17:20.440
to,
to being tortured all my friends to shitty music,

250
00:17:20.441 --> 00:17:22.910
which these mountains with them torturing your friends.

251
00:17:22.911 --> 00:17:26.990
It was just such a nice evening and this beautiful house.
It was incredible.
Well,

252
00:17:26.991 --> 00:17:31.550
with the view.
Very special.
Ah,
there we go.
Finally.
Okay.

253
00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.890
Anyway,
I want to thank you all for coming tonight.

254
00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:37.710
It's very special night for myself.
We're gonna play some songs that I wrote.

255
00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:38.940
Isn't the

256
00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.820
<v 1>fucking Hollywood bowl.
It's everybody for coming out tonight,
right?</v>

257
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.460
Could you imagine a comedians did this guys,

258
00:17:44.461 --> 00:17:48.960
this next bit I wrote about taking a shit,
uh,
while I was,
believe it or not,

259
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:53.010
an actual shit of you enjoy it.
I wrote it to make you happy.

260
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.640
I read this guy does everything.
I can't wait.
Does it know,

261
00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.560
<v 9>wow,</v>

262
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.990
<v 1>what sucks about rich people?
Also,
by the way,</v>

263
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.510
this is why when it comes down to it,

264
00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.930
hanging out with rich people can really suck.
Yeah.
You know,

265
00:18:09.931 --> 00:18:14.850
they have a to manufactured fun.
Yeah.
It's cause you don't want to like,

266
00:18:14.851 --> 00:18:15.300
don't you,

267
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:19.190
there's tag along owners who they just want to be there for the free food.
Sure.

268
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.860
Hang out and they're never going to tell you,
hey bro,
your shit sucks.
Yeah.

269
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:27.510
But this jam out in a,
in a fucking trailer park,
it was way more on,

270
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:31.260
you know what I mean?
Like this,
this,
the equal party in,
you know,

271
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:35.690
in a person's $30,000 parking lot is,
is it's,

272
00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.270
it's way better than the band who has to go up,
um,
you know,

273
00:18:39.271 --> 00:18:43.260
and a pay or play situation or just like the band that struggles and does shit

274
00:18:43.261 --> 00:18:47.370
holes.
It gets real reactions from audiences.
I respect that.
I have no hobbies.

275
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:50.540
I mean,
I just work,
I do it that way.

276
00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:57.350
<v 9>Hi.
No,
no,</v>

277
00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:03.170
no.
Anyway,

278
00:19:03.171 --> 00:19:07.840
I'm going to want to start with one of my,
uh,
it's about,
um,

279
00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.990
you get a little serious here for a second.
We'll sentimental.
You know,

280
00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:14.570
I wouldn't what I do,
especially I spend a lot of my time as the document.

281
00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:15.404
I'll walk in the room.

282
00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:18.500
You don't know what to do unless you have something that's wrong

283
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.900
and you know,
but I think a lot of it is we get on in life.
We,
we,

284
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.220
we are that way in our days.
You know,

285
00:19:25.221 --> 00:19:28.710
we spent so much time finding what's wrong about things in life in this,

286
00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:32.740
<v 1>this is a back yard shot of jam though.
God,
that's my whole thing is like,</v>

287
00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:36.340
don't you tell somebody that if they went to see,

288
00:19:36.341 --> 00:19:40.810
like he's just playing in the backyard,
he's a Coachella in his mind,

289
00:19:40.811 --> 00:19:44.110
he's headlining Coachella.
Um,
you know what?

290
00:19:44.111 --> 00:19:46.240
I do think he thinks it's going to happen though.
He's like,

291
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.680
if I just put my music out there,

292
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.920
somebody's watching this and I'm going to get a record.

293
00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.090
Somebody is watching this,

294
00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:58.330
we're here to crush every musician's dreams,
et cetera.
But seriously,

295
00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:03.340
like Nick Hock and this guy,
similar things.
Like if I put it way better,

296
00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:07.210
way better was the worst.
I'd rather go to this concert than the Nic Hahn.

297
00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.070
I would ask for an explanation of every song.

298
00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:14.020
If I went to see this guy overseeing one Nicole.
Yeah,
me too.
Absolutely.

299
00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:19.210
Yeah.
Our full fucking two hours at over one nick hawks.
Of course.
Yeah.

300
00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:20.613
This is pain

301
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:24.400
<v 9>is actually called what's wrong?
Exclamation point.</v>

302
00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:26.260
It's really bad appreciation.

303
00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:31.470
<v 1>Supposedly.
Exclamation mark.
Are you supposed to explain that much?</v>

304
00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:37.080
What the song is about?
No,
come on man.
Nobody wants to take care of this guy.

305
00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:39.060
<v 5>Look,</v>

306
00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:43.560
you know he's young women like me and I liked them can,

307
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:48.910
it has always been that way.
Not to throw up.
I don't to see that my agent,

308
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:53.360
I end.
I rarely know how to please a woman.
Right.

309
00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:57.380
<v 1>Throw up.
I knew it was going here.
I got grossed out before it went there.</v>

310
00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:01.500
I knew this guy's an asshole.
I don't like him.
What'd you go with him?
No.

311
00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:02.383
What would it take?

312
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.950
<v 0>What?
What do you mean by hookup?
Let's talk about at all.</v>

313
00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:11.600
What about if you had to,
would it be him

314
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:16.880
or the mail?
Man,
you've already began a little something with,

315
00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.180
with the sexy legs.
That's a sexy legs post,
man.
Yeah.

316
00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:25.530
<v 1>Well,
sex.
He likes post man.
He's like 10 years younger than this guy.</v>

317
00:21:25.531 --> 00:21:30.310
I know he's not there.
I'll Bob.
Bob is not 10 years younger.

318
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.880
Bob's way more normal than this.
Dude.
I'm not arguing that.

319
00:21:33.881 --> 00:21:34.960
I'm just saying he's not a tenured yet.

320
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:37.600
Bob's way more attractive than this fucking dirt pig.

321
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:42.790
Look how dry and smelly his mouth and that's all you get because I can see how

322
00:21:42.791 --> 00:21:44.320
it smells.
Look how it smells.

323
00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:50.380
<v 0>You don't know it is of course.
What do you think it smells like?</v>

324
00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:54.550
Dab Mouth or old rotten dad.
Man,
here's a,

325
00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:57.340
let's see what else he says he's gross.
I don't like this guy won.

326
00:21:57.341 --> 00:22:00.130
But why do you not like about him?
Cause he's a creep salad,
but you,

327
00:22:00.131 --> 00:22:04.950
he makes you quiver like that.
He knows all this special tricks throw out.

328
00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:10.660
<v 5>Now,
honestly,</v>

329
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:16.320
I don't care what people say or think we know that Selena thinks about it is

330
00:22:16.901 --> 00:22:18.010
another matter.

331
00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:24.060
Why was too short to take seriously all the time now about Selena,

332
00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:27.510
my health has been bad for sometime now.
I know.

333
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.640
And the only person I hear from on a daily basis besides Jacob and Celina shy

334
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.890
the size to use your radio interviews.

335
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:42.000
<v 0>Do you think I can't take this guy?
He scares me.
What?</v>

336
00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:45.450
It freak you out if he be pleased you in a way you've never been pleased.
Stop.

337
00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:51.480
Stop it.
What?
It's so gross.
Um,

338
00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:53.820
he's so gross.
Yeah.

339
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:56.630
<v 1>I would rather be with a vegan vagina guy than this guy.</v>

340
00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:00.440
<v 5>Whoa.
Holy.
That is a good caring woman.</v>

341
00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:07.450
<v 1>Next subject.
Hey,
I don't like this guy.
All right.
All right.
All right.</v>

342
00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:11.080
So I'm just going to close them out.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Well there you go.

343
00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:15.930
The genes power back to back.
Um,
can we talk about some important issues?

344
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.980
Sure.
Yeah.
Number one,

345
00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:23.490
we finally watched the season finale of Downton Abbey.

346
00:23:23.711 --> 00:23:26.660
And can I tell you something?
Yeah,
I judge people.
Yeah.

347
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:30.640
If they call it downtown Abby.
Oh my God,
we're not friends.
Yeah,

348
00:23:30.641 --> 00:23:33.220
I know downtown Abbey.
Really?
You've seen it,
right?

349
00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:36.280
Everyone's seen it written down.
And I know it's very clear what it is.

350
00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:39.880
I hate downtown.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's,
um,

351
00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:41.613
it's beautiful.

352
00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:47.930
You're so good of I love this is when the golden retriever,

353
00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:52.790
they go to in retrievers.
Has He shown me this thing?

354
00:23:52.791 --> 00:23:56.120
No,
I miss it already.

355
00:23:56.121 --> 00:23:58.550
I'm so upset that it's over now.

356
00:23:58.551 --> 00:24:03.050
We're late on this cause we didn't have television for the last three weeks here

357
00:24:03.051 --> 00:24:04.850
and moved and everything.
Yeah.

358
00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:09.880
I Miss Downton guys.
Tell you what I'm really upset about.

359
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:13.970
Let's go through the stories.
Let's go through it again.
What's the button?

360
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.110
The Guy,
uh,
but I don't like,
what's his name?
Branson.
No,

361
00:24:18.111 --> 00:24:21.740
I like Branson.
Branson got chunkier.

362
00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:26.780
Mr. Fuck in the gay dude.
Thomas Barrow.

363
00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.890
Barrow's first of all,
I was upset that he didn't go through at the suicide.

364
00:24:30.891 --> 00:24:33.810
I really want to Mr Barrows to die.
That's so horrible.
What,

365
00:24:33.811 --> 00:24:37.280
what is up with you on that?
He was just such as shit.
It's like,

366
00:24:37.281 --> 00:24:38.450
what does short memory be wowed?

367
00:24:38.451 --> 00:24:42.320
They don't remember that Mr Barrow has tried to sabotage everything downtown.

368
00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.970
Um,
and uh,
you know,
I'm glad you had a change of heart,
but I

369
00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:48.590
<v 10>not really like him.</v>

370
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:52.430
I thought it was kind of cool that he came back and the way they tied it

371
00:24:52.431 --> 00:24:54.230
together,
I liked it.
I actually liked it.

372
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.260
<v 1>I like how everybody got a nice ending.</v>

373
00:24:56.290 --> 00:25:01.240
I love that Edith triumphed over Mary Anne.
In terms of status,

374
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:05.230
she ended up with a better love match marriage or just better marriage and

375
00:25:05.231 --> 00:25:06.064
status.

376
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:11.690
<v 10>Cool.
Um,
yeah.
And she actually overcame her continuous.
Yeah.</v>

377
00:25:11.691 --> 00:25:15.700
That was basically the theme of most of that episode was there like you're a con

378
00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:21.090
and then they had Edith call her a cunt and then she saw her cantinas and then

379
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.390
was like,
you're right.

380
00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:24.030
<v 1>I really,
I agree with you.</v>

381
00:25:24.031 --> 00:25:28.010
I didn't know it was really nice and I love that final orgy scene at the end of

382
00:25:28.011 --> 00:25:28.320
the

383
00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:32.040
<v 10>episodes.
So it's actually trying to pull it up.</v>

384
00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.600
Yeah.

385
00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:39.360
<v 1>Where Carson finally brought out his huge hog and Lord Grantham finally dropped</v>

386
00:25:41.981 --> 00:25:46.660
to his knees like he's wanted to for years.
It's great.
And Blue Carson.

387
00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:48.373
<v 10>Yeah.</v>

388
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:52.940
Because the thing is that there's that scene where

389
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:56.420
it turns out,
I'll just tell you,

390
00:25:56.421 --> 00:26:01.130
Carson has a bit of an ailment and there are all these kind of keeping it

391
00:26:01.131 --> 00:26:05.300
hidden.
And then Mrs. Hughes says you have to tell everyone.

392
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.810
So Carson in like one of the final scenes,

393
00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:14.530
he drops his pants and he has a fully erect penis and he goes,

394
00:26:15.111 --> 00:26:17.350
this is what I've been hiding.
And then he,

395
00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:22.310
he walks over to the all the girls and he puts it in each of their mouths for a

396
00:26:22.311 --> 00:26:26.280
moment.
What's really special is the UK edition.
That's right.
Right.
You know,

397
00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.850
not a lot of Americans got to see this one.
We paid extra,

398
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.100
but you get to see Carson,

399
00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:35.670
he fucks Korah he fucks lady Mary flux eat it other.

400
00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.720
<v 1>Yeah.
And what I loved in the UK edition anyways,</v>

401
00:26:40.721 --> 00:26:44.310
I don't know if Americans saw they uh,

402
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:49.140
they gave cousin violet a pushup Bra.
Yes.
Finally.
Yes.

403
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:53.270
They got to see her tits hoist it up a little higher than goes on,

404
00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:57.570
usually hung so low.
I like rose goes,

405
00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.470
I came back from a maverick

406
00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:05.760
pushup Brock cousin.
Right.
Cause at Hogwarts it's okay if for Ted to that way,

407
00:27:05.761 --> 00:27:10.580
right?
Yeah,
she just teaching.
Right.
But a Downton unacceptable.
Unacceptable.
Yeah.

408
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:15.670
Yeah.
Rose came back that little slut.
Yup.
She's got a baby now.
Yeah.

409
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.760
And uh,
her husband's not attractive.

410
00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:22.140
I will say the roses way cuter than her husband.
I agree.

411
00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.200
Do you think,
how's that going over there?

412
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:31.080
So we've found this in our home.
Next door to our child's room.
Yeah.

413
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:35.890
And our new nanny.
Yeah.
It was watching her child while I do this.
Yep.

414
00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:41.160
I was trying to find that scene.
Cora.
Cora,

415
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:45.240
fish face always with the fish.
That's her face in every scene.

416
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:49.350
Every scene insurance goes,
I'm afraid not or I'm afraid.

417
00:27:49.351 --> 00:27:52.860
So they're always eat.
It is everybody's afraid of feelings.
Yeah.

418
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:57.660
Though the reason there's never an emotional stake.
No feelings.

419
00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:03.070
Is there any common those bowls
and then,
right.

420
00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.060
You guys always go,
I should like that very much.

421
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.000
I'm afraid they're going to come out of your balls and he goes,

422
00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:13.530
I should like that.
Indeed.
Yeah.
I should.
I should like that very much.

423
00:28:13.531 --> 00:28:17.310
Carson I should like of that's interesting that they did resolve the,

424
00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:21.300
the unanswered question of is there any come in Carson's balls when we found out

425
00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:25.830
there is,
there's a lot of carbon.
Carson small.
There's a lot.
Yeah,
there's a lot.

426
00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.260
Anna had her baby,
which was exciting.
They had,
yeah.

427
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.133
<v 7>Boy</v>

428
00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.580
Is that Carson ejaculate in an area.

429
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:41.360
That's right.
I remember

430
00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:52.010
right.
I almost forgot.

431
00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.400
<v 9>This is when the servants finally come upstairs.
This is a lady,
Mary's.</v>

432
00:28:58.401 --> 00:29:02.180
We're like,
we've been holding onto this for years.
Your lordship

433
00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.633
ladies shift.

434
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:16.170
<v 1>Everybody's happy.
It was a happy ending and down.
Really cool the way it is.</v>

435
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:17.890
The Christmas episode.
Yeah.
Yeah,

436
00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:21.030
and there are the you'll after you log Carson comes on.

437
00:29:21.031 --> 00:29:23.770
Everybody that pays the black.
It's really sweet ending.

438
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:29.370
Someone brought the mistletoe and this is what happened.
You go chip.
Yes.
Costume

439
00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.480
<v 9>pretty good.
No,
I am upset.</v>

440
00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:46.560
<v 7>I hear that there's a high here and Mrs. Hughes.</v>

441
00:29:46.561 --> 00:29:49.660
This is happy and Cora just came.
Yeah,

442
00:29:49.661 --> 00:29:54.200
we agree that it's a really beautiful show.
Mr Barrels is either getting it on.

443
00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.353
Yes.

444
00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:59.890
<v 1>Seriousness.
One was Lord Grantham,
his happy ending.</v>

445
00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.200
<v 10>He got to see his daughter Edith,</v>

446
00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:06.430
who's just his whole adult life has just been bad luck.
Yeah.

447
00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:11.070
Be Happy.
Um,
and then he saw Mary be happy as well.

448
00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:14.970
And Carson came on her and that's why he saw Carson jazz all over his daughters

449
00:30:14.971 --> 00:30:19.110
and then,
yeah.
Um,
yeah.
And then he,
you know,
it was interesting.

450
00:30:19.111 --> 00:30:24.111
He was one of the people he accepted the way that life was changing more so than

451
00:30:27.721 --> 00:30:32.721
Carson because those are really the representatives of each of each I have

452
00:30:32.971 --> 00:30:34.670
upstairs and downstairs.
Right,
right.

453
00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.380
Carson actually wanted to hold onto it more so than his

454
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:41.030
<v 1>Lord shifted.
Interesting.
I'm really had some really good observation.
Yeah.
Tom.</v>

455
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.970
I mean,
no,

456
00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:45.720
what I want to know is where do they shit and they didn't really address that.

457
00:30:45.721 --> 00:30:50.460
He never gave us a shitting scene in all,
what is it,
six seasons?

458
00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:50.851
I mean,

459
00:30:50.851 --> 00:30:54.300
does someone have to wipe his lordship and his lady ship her ladyship they

460
00:30:54.301 --> 00:30:59.160
probably used cloth for a while.
Right.
And then I wash,
wash his lordship's dirty.

461
00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.610
I'm done.
That's an in Washington.

462
00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.220
They ring the bell and the Carson asked,
where do they go?

463
00:31:05.221 --> 00:31:08.640
Because they didn't have toilets.
They did a 10,
1850.
They did.

464
00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:12.480
They must've had indoor plumbing.
That nice house.

465
00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:18.270
None.
Didn't have outhouses.
Yeah,
they had,
they must've had some kind of indoor,

466
00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:21.260
well that's our really,
Julian Fellowes knows the answer that okay.

467
00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:26.190
<v 10>Julian does know the answer to that.
Um,
by the way,</v>

468
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:31.310
<v 1>they would not sit with our backs to the chairs at Towlerton Edwardian Times.</v>

469
00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.950
Your Lordship,
you have no more common your balls.
May I leave now?

470
00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:40.643
<v 11>Okay.</v>

471
00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.770
Yeah,
maybe.
Sounds to me.
Okay.
So this is pat more than Mac.

472
00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:49.960
We have something right quick.

473
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:54.220
<v 12>I was telling you to sandwich.
Does he,
is that good?
That's good.</v>

474
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:58.240
Always wants to eat.

475
00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:00.843
<v 11>Yes.</v>

476
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:08.050
<v 12>Oh,
whip up my basket.
Ah.
Oh.</v>

477
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:10.550
Wayne's feeling his lordship wedding card.

478
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:16.880
<v 11>It's true.
It does.
You're going to wear those tails.
Okay.</v>

479
00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.890
<v 1>I love them.
My favorite thing ever,
and Downton is the time,</v>

480
00:32:19.891 --> 00:32:24.440
when was it Tom came back and he didn't have his dinner.
Tuxedo.
Yeah.

481
00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:28.350
And they were appalled that he just wore his regular suit.
Well at dinner.

482
00:32:28.351 --> 00:32:31.380
It's like what type of man that's,
that's really where it goes.
They're like,
yeah,

483
00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:34.260
what type of fucking man,
what are you,

484
00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:38.580
it doesn't travel with his,
you know.
Right.

485
00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:40.490
His Tuxedo.
Yeah.

486
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.300
Could you imagine getting verse the Con and we found out it down.

487
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:48.350
It's all in Carson's balls series finale.

488
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:52.540
I loved it.
I just loved that.
Where's the cow?
Where's the con?
Yup.

489
00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:57.080
I want to know is who,
anyway,

490
00:32:57.081 --> 00:33:01.130
I'm glad we got that.
Now we are.
Our next order of business is house of farts.

491
00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:03.230
Cause we haven't even touched that

492
00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.230
<v 10>because of the move.
Move.
Fucked this all up.
And by the way,</v>

493
00:33:06.231 --> 00:33:11.231
this is something I learned through this is that our wifi signal was not um,

494
00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:16.820
strong enough basically in our living room.

495
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:20.340
So for those of you that don't know that we were retarded like me,
uh,

496
00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:23.840
you can get a little thing called a Wifi extender and you plug it right into

497
00:33:23.841 --> 00:33:27.120
your wall and it boosts your signal game changers.
So cool.
What a,

498
00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:29.250
<v 1>and it goes like a little gadget.
That's all we needed,</v>

499
00:33:29.251 --> 00:33:33.450
which we bought on Amazon through our banner.
Your Mom's house?
I did.
I did have

500
00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:35.670
<v 10>really fun time discovering it.</v>

501
00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:40.500
I called Time Warner who we have our Internet service from because they're the

502
00:33:40.501 --> 00:33:43.710
only provider here,
which really is cool.
How they

503
00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:46.070
<v 1>monopolize and it's a monopoly.</v>

504
00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:53.900
Sorry,
professional Tom.
It's your daddy.
You don't want to answer it.

505
00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:57.580
<v 10>He knows my dad cause I saw it.
Oh,
where did it come up there</v>

506
00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:04.430
like Carson came.
So my,

507
00:34:04.431 --> 00:34:07.190
um,
I called them and I said,
you know,
I'm having trouble with the Internet.

508
00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:10.940
And they go,
okay,
well we'll send somebody out.
So the guy comes out,

509
00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:16.010
he comes into this room,
which is our studio office,
and he goes,

510
00:34:16.011 --> 00:34:19.070
uh,
so what's the problem?
I go,
well,
you know,
it's working great here,

511
00:34:19.071 --> 00:34:22.280
but in the living room it isn't great.
And he goes,
okay.

512
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:23.870
So it doesn't really say anything.

513
00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.850
A few minutes later I see him in the living room.

514
00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:30.120
He's got the router in his hand and I go,
so what are you gonna do?
He goes,

515
00:34:30.121 --> 00:34:34.280
we'll plug it in here.
That way it'll be strong in here.
And I go,

516
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:37.460
but we'll only be a week in the office then.
And he goes,
probably

517
00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:41.080
<v 1>cool.
Problem solved.
I don't know what the problem this time I'm going to go,</v>

518
00:34:41.081 --> 00:34:41.950
what are you complaining about?

519
00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:42.990
<v 10>So what should I do?</v>

520
00:34:42.991 --> 00:34:47.210
I mean it shouldn't I do like should I get a second router or should I get that

521
00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:51.610
Wifi senator?
He goes,
oh,
those extenders work.
Great.
She got one of those.
Hmm.

522
00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:56.280
And I go,
okay.
He goes,
I'm going to go put it back in the office.
Then I go,
okay,

523
00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:59.670
thanks for coming.
So he put it,
plugged it back in where it was and then he left.

524
00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:04.110
<v 1>Cool.
Thanks for coming.
Time Warner.
Yeah.
Excellent.
Excellent company by far.</v>

525
00:35:04.111 --> 00:35:07.530
My least favorite,
uh,
Internet and cable provider.

526
00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.260
We're not getting their cable service by the way.

527
00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:11.670
<v 10>Uh,
uh,</v>

528
00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:16.840
<v 1>fuse that I've had time Warner cable.
It is garbage dog shit.
Yeah,</v>

529
00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:20.400
we're just doing apple TV right now.
Cut The cord man.

530
00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:24.040
<v 10>Cut the corner.
And we had time Warner and I thought we'd never have to dog shit,</v>

531
00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:27.900
but when we moved we had to fucking horrible time Warner's dog shit.

532
00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:30.690
They always have the worst.
So disappointing.

533
00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:33.030
It's just the worst customer service.
Oh yeah.

534
00:35:33.031 --> 00:35:35.490
They don't just don't take care of you.
Um,

535
00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:40.380
speaking of bad ass fuckers and shit like that,
stuff like that.
Oh,

536
00:35:40.381 --> 00:35:45.360
these are crazy legs.
Um,
our good friend,
crazy lokes uh,

537
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:50.010
who I think is open to working out with me if I go to San Jose,

538
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:55.380
he has a freestyle rap here in Spanish.
Is that correct?
It's in Spanish.

539
00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:57.690
So that's kind of my forte.

540
00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:00.360
That's going to see what it sounds I haven't heard of yet.

541
00:36:00.361 --> 00:36:01.050
Do you want to hear it?

542
00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:03.870
<v 1>Uh,
do I have a choice in the matter?</v>

543
00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:10.730
<v 13>All signed quite low.
Small speed.
Well not time,
but the</v>

544
00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:16.820
mommy's
mommy's way towards them.

545
00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:22.570
That would be so
nice

546
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:28.350
towards nominees way me sake.

547
00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:33.410
It is all this cis class near this.

548
00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.000
He thought your map,

549
00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:39.850
<v 10>somebody speaking in tongues before,</v>

550
00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:44.110
like in a church when they heal them and they're like [inaudible].

551
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.000
That's basically what

552
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:46.840
<v 1>he's like.
Momma,</v>

553
00:36:46.841 --> 00:36:51.730
same Momma Sam a Macusa is basically that jibberish raise jibberish with,

554
00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:56.980
with like a word in Spanish in every sentence.
And mostly because I'm not,

555
00:36:56.981 --> 00:36:59.170
I don't speak Spanish like you do fluently.
I don't,

556
00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:02.560
but I know enough like la Spanish to get,

557
00:37:02.561 --> 00:37:04.220
and I don't understand what the fuck this guy's talking.

558
00:37:04.221 --> 00:37:06.800
He's Filipino so he knows how to pronounce the words

559
00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:13.210
he and their Spanish words in his
language.

560
00:37:13.211 --> 00:37:16.330
But that's the package.
It's a FedEx package is here.

561
00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:20.620
Does anybody says this dog is the worst duck.
We want a dog.

562
00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:25.670
It's a Brussels Griffon.
Beautiful little girl.
Really sweet animal.

563
00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:29.480
<v 10>You'll see her in a pillow case floating down the La River at about,</v>

564
00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:31.443
um,

565
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.940
<v 1>go ahead and pick that up.
It's your dog or with your dog.</v>

566
00:37:34.941 --> 00:37:39.160
She might be on the four oh five freeway.
Yeah,
at the Santa Monica exit.
Yeah,

567
00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.900
just waiting,
just kinda hanging out.
God,

568
00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:47.690
can I tell you what this dog,
if anybody out there,
if you're a real dog trainer,

569
00:37:47.691 --> 00:37:51.020
and don't fucking email me if you're not legit.
Our doggies,

570
00:37:51.021 --> 00:37:54.740
everything in the backyard.
And I mean,
everything,
rocks,

571
00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.190
glass pieces.
She's indiscriminate.
I'm mean it,

572
00:37:58.191 --> 00:38:01.100
and we're lucky she still alive frankly.
Uh,

573
00:38:01.101 --> 00:38:04.130
but now whatever the fuck she's eating in our backyard has given her diarrhea

574
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:06.880
and she's had diarrhea twice in the last two weeks,
and he goes,

575
00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:07.910
we don't know what to do.

576
00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:10.610
Either we muzzle her when we learned about or what area.
Yeah,

577
00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.850
but I don't know how to keep her from eating.
Whatever the fuck it is.

578
00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:17.210
And it's everything.
Everything and anything.
Yeah.
I don't know what to do.

579
00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.800
I'm at a loss.
Yeah.

580
00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:25.640
She's worse of a fireplace so we can put her in there.
Here's your new Craig.

581
00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:29.170
Get in the grade.
Gonna be,
Hey,
we're going to turn it on.

582
00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.110
She would just go,
no,
she wouldn't eat the fire.

583
00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:36.100
She went

584
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:40.630
<v 0>up and we turn on the fireplace.
She went right up to it and was like,
yeah,</v>

585
00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:45.610
she almost did start looking.
The Flyer,
she's so inbred and stupid.
Gorgeous dog,

586
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:49.870
designer,
dog.
Dumbest dog.
We ever had.
Fee from Downey,
from the streets.

587
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:52.360
Smartest,
never runs away.

588
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:54.840
Wouldn't dream of running away because he knows how hard it is.

589
00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:55.883
<v 11>No.</v>

590
00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:58.080
<v 7>Anyway,
I</v>

591
00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:03.800
Culito's are delicious.
Taco Bell,

592
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:11.340
<v 0>his crew there is enjoying him.
Right.
And I laughing.
They're laughing at him.</v>

593
00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:18.880
<v 7>What's some of the hair there?
It's called the kiss.</v>

594
00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:36.910
<v 0>It's a lot.
It's hard.
It's hard.
It's hard to,</v>

595
00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:41.600
there's a lot of shitty music on this show today.
Yeah,
yeah,

596
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:45.880
yeah.
It's been awhile.
We have to keep it short though.

597
00:39:45.881 --> 00:39:50.010
We don't want to enrage the lessons up.
Greg,
from that for a second.

598
00:39:50.011 --> 00:39:53.870
This I discovered was sent,
um,

599
00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:58.960
yesterday as I was kind of going through these clips with blue man and,
um,

600
00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:04.110
just check this out.
This lady,
she's pretty great men.
Uh,

601
00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:05.880
lifting weights at a weightlifting meet.

602
00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:07.310
<v 11>Okay.</v>

603
00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:12.310
[inaudible]

604
00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:30.910
<v 0>that she's awesome.
That was Grad.</v>

605
00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:35.510
That's not a normal scream for weightlifting.
And I like it though.

606
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:39.290
She is hilarious.
She lifts a second time and you wouldn't believe it.

607
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:41.060
She's back to screaming.

608
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:46.200
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

609
00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:59.970
<v 0>only other time I've heard a woman scream like that is when you make number two.</v>

610
00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:05.610
I can hear you throughout the house,
the house.
And I grabbed the ball.
I got it.

611
00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:11.620
I've heard it a few times.
When we had Korean BBQ,

612
00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:14.710
we ordered Thai.
I hear you in there

613
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:21.400
when I was in labor and I cursed a lot.
Yeah.

614
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:25.140
<v 11>[inaudible] this</v>

615
00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:29.250
<v 0>lady cause all the Nice nurses were like,
hmm.
I was dropping f bombs,</v>

616
00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:34.390
dropping racial slurs.
Uh,

617
00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:36.600
<v 1>by the way,
that reminds me,
uh,</v>

618
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:41.120
my cousin Julie chimed in on the nick hoc tattoo thing.

619
00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:44.540
Oh yeah.
Let me read you what she,
she has a lot of tattoos.

620
00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:49.040
<v 0>He knows a lot about
the world attachment.</v>

621
00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:52.330
Hold on,
let me find what she has to say.

622
00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:57.580
What was the reason we're doing that from a lacroix?

623
00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:03.210
Yeah,
it's Lacroix.
Laquan.
It's not like why it's,

624
00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:07.450
look,
I took French,
I took French.

625
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:11.590
It's liquid.
It's French.
I spent time in valley.

626
00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:16.350
I have a lot of Canadian friends.
Is the national language.
It's Lacrosse.

627
00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:19.180
Like Woah.
No,

Oh,

628
00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:24.480
It's not like quiet,
not quiet.
You're retarded.
Delicious.

629
00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:29.250
It's not only quiets lacroix.
See

630
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.850
now this is lacroix.
Sarah,

631
00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:39.110
<v 1>Eh,
Spec tech</v>

632
00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:43.330

Eh.
All right,</v>

633
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:47.760
look what it's Lacroix Lacroix.
Quiet.
Not Quiet.

634
00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:48.923
Okay,

635
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:53.330
<v 1>here it is.
[inaudible] here it goes.
She writes my cousin Juliet.</v>

636
00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:58.130
I was always confused about what the Hell Nick Hawks Tattoo on his shoulder was.

637
00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:01.670
It's where we should,
oh yeah,
let's bring it up,

638
00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:08.240
ladies and gentlemen.
Comedies.

639
00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:09.803
<v 0>Ooh,</v>

640
00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:17.190
<v 1>yeah.
I say,
Oh,
this is a good</v>

641
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:22.050
<v 0>image I think to use for what we're discussing.
Let's see.
Eh,</v>

642
00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:23.190
Eh,

643
00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:33.410
there is,
how do you say,
how do you say,

644
00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:35.900
look at this mother fucker.

645
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:42.430
<v 1>What are you doing dude?
What is that?
So that's what I asked her about because,</v>

646
00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:45.830
so you should set some context.
You'd,

647
00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:50.850
your cousin has a lot of texting and her husband Justin,

648
00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:54.560
they are like,
I would consider them tattoo aficionados.
Sure.

649
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:57.990
They both have a lot.
Julie has a lie,
tattoos and she,
you know,

650
00:43:57.991 --> 00:44:01.500
she hangs out in that community.
She knows the folks.
You're talking to yourself.

651
00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:07.600
She knows a Turd when she sees she knows turtle.
Yeah.
Totes.
And so,
um,

652
00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:10.620
I thought it was a bad cover up on his shoulder as well.
I was like,
oh,

653
00:44:10.621 --> 00:44:12.150
is he covering up something shitty?

654
00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:16.110
And she thought it was a poorly executed cover up.
The closer she says,

655
00:44:16.111 --> 00:44:16.944
I look at it,

656
00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:21.690
the more I think that it's a poorly executed venom transformation tattoo from

657
00:44:21.691 --> 00:44:23.880
the Spiderman comics.
If I'm cracked,

658
00:44:23.881 --> 00:44:27.630
it's supposed to be the black goo that encapsulates someone and turns them into

659
00:44:27.631 --> 00:44:30.960
the venom character.
If you look closely at his elbow in certain,

660
00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:36.280
you can clearly see the sharp pointy teeth that venom has c.

661
00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:40.590
Right.
So,
um,
it's like when that character,
that venom character,

662
00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:48.040
it's like it grows on you and takes over you.
That's the thing.
Yeah,

663
00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:51.900
it looks really cool.
It doesn't look Douchey at all.
And I liked it.
It's,

664
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:55.080
there's more here.
It's down the hip.
It's horrible.

665
00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:59.080
And I'm not a tattoo aficionado whatsoever,

666
00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:04.350
but they're also dumb.
Oh my good night,
Irene.

667
00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.550
Really?
Oh,
that guy's got better tat

668
00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:14.560
there we are.
I mean,
look,
I just,
I feel like they're super lame thing.

669
00:45:14.561 --> 00:45:17.690
Think about him and he's just a guy that takes himself too seriously.
That's why.

670
00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:21.980
Yeah.
That's kind of sucks.
And he's got the venom stuff growing over his,

671
00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:25.650
his cock and balls,
missy.
That's what she's talking about.
You know,

672
00:45:25.651 --> 00:45:30.300
and then it takes over you.
I mean,
that's too seriously.

673
00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:32.850
That's why it's lame.
Yeah.
Way Too seriously.

674
00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:39.110
Please let us know.
How do you click out of this?
God Damn it.

675
00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:44.340
Yeah,
it's a,
it's a lot.
It's just not,
they're not cool to.

676
00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:48.680
And as far as I know in the tattooing world or he had shoes coolants,

677
00:45:48.681 --> 00:45:51.970
like that guy has got like tough one's kind of cool.
You know,

678
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:54.180
there should be some skulls,
right?

679
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:58.140
There should be some bloody hearts or something.

680
00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:00.261
Like my cousin,

681
00:46:00.261 --> 00:46:05.261
she's got like some fucking dope ass chess piece with like a heart and you know,

682
00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:10.190
cool,
cool stuff.
Spider webs on elbows.
That stuff's cool.

683
00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:11.690
Then knock all tats.

684
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:15.830
I'm a huge fan of knuckle Tad's well this is like whack.

685
00:46:15.831 --> 00:46:19.040
I feel like his study girl get your life.

686
00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:25.240
Oh boy.
Oh boy.
Everything about him is,
oh boy.
Yeah,

687
00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:29.510
I'm working on my raps.
Poor guy.

688
00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:33.710
You know my kid and there's a lot he's suffering inside.

689
00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:39.500
All right.
Um,
Lino and there you have it.
That's so thank you cousin.

690
00:46:39.501 --> 00:46:44.480
Julie.
Can I,
um,
try something real quick?
Yeah.
Well since we're talking about,

691
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:49.430
um,
Lacroix,
hey,

692
00:46:49.431 --> 00:46:53.870
rob Ford died.
I know we liked him.
We like making fun of him on their Shell,

693
00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.360
Babe.
No,
we did.
We talked about it on I,

694
00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.040
she played him a lot because he was hilarious.
Yeah.

695
00:46:58.770 --> 00:46:59.603
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

696
00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:05.040
<v 1>he was,
um,
it was sad though.
I was convinced as soon as I heard that he died,</v>

697
00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:10.260
that he,
uh,
that he died from an overdose or a heart attack.

698
00:47:10.261 --> 00:47:12.780
I didn't know he was fighting cancer.
I didn't know that either.
Yeah.

699
00:47:12.781 --> 00:47:16.200
I would think it would be drugs or something.
Yeah.
It's really sad.

700
00:47:16.201 --> 00:47:20.220
He did lean that direction and we lost Gary Shandling too.
That's really sad,
man.

701
00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:24.270
I love the Garry Shandling show was a kid.
Oh my God.
And the Larry Sanders show.

702
00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:27.000
That was amazing.
That is comedy gold.

703
00:47:27.001 --> 00:47:30.010
If you guys want to really dive into a

704
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:33.640
<v 0>show and you haven't seen the Larry Sanders show,
it's fucking incredible.</v>

705
00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:37.960
Now it's real.

711
00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:57.680
The answering,
how are you calling?

712
00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:00.380
<v 14>Begin speaking after the tone.</v>

713
00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:04.550
Then hang up when you were finished or press any key for further options.

714
00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:08.380
<v 0>Who is this?
Right?
I was calling the quiet,
it's,</v>

715
00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:12.640
lacroix has called them to talk to them about it.

716
00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:17.740
It's like dammit.
It's like,
why are they on France time?

717
00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:22.270
Yeah.
Because they are in L'aquila wait,
isn't this like Canadian though?

718
00:48:22.271 --> 00:48:26.920
Like French Canadian?
I don't know where they make product of USA.
Wait a minute.

719
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:29.050
Yeah.
It doesn't seem right.

720
00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:34.630
Uh hmm.
So do you really making me Burp a lot?

721
00:48:34.631 --> 00:48:37.750
I don't know if I should be drinking these as often during the show.

722
00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:39.230
This is the most I burped.
I feel like,

723
00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:46.600
I don't think it's good
potato.
Patato Tom.
Uh,

724
00:48:46.601 --> 00:48:50.590
so that's what your mom's house is based on.
Burps and farts.
Burps and farts.

725
00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:51.520
That's what we're about.

726
00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:56.320
I should tell you this then in sort of,
you know,

727
00:48:56.770 --> 00:48:58.840
we didn't mean for it to coincide like this,

728
00:48:58.841 --> 00:49:03.841
but I shot a show,

729
00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:08.410
a presentation a year,
more than a year ago.
Um,

730
00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:12.160
where the focus,
like the,
the inspiration of,

731
00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:17.620
of this show idea was,
um,
rob forward in a way.

732
00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:18.454
It was alright.

733
00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:23.640
It was a show called the people's mayor and we shot it and we kind of,

734
00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:26.193
you know,

735
00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:27.250
<v 15>yeah.</v>

736
00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:27.730
<v 0>I tried to,</v>

737
00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:32.730
to shop it around and they finally allowed us to put it on Youtube.

738
00:49:34.241 --> 00:49:37.900
I just put it up,
um,
three hours ago.

739
00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.000
It's called the people's mayor.

740
00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:44.050
It was written by Tom [inaudible] who wrote for the Letterman for 15 years.

741
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:46.960
So he's so fucking funny.

742
00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:49.930
This was a really good pilot and I really loved you in it.

743
00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:52.900
I thought it was a great character for you.
I'm sad that it didn't get picked up.

744
00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:55.950
Yeah,
this is a great show.
It was,

745
00:49:57.490 --> 00:49:59.510
oh yeah.
Had Lung Cancer.
This is a,

746
00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:03.580
gave her that same prognosis was 14 years ago.

747
00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:07.510
It was that high remain cancer free.
Oh,
she died 13 and a half years ago.
Why,

748
00:50:07.511 --> 00:50:08.344
why are you telling me this?

749
00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:13.150
Cause it was like six months to the day when these doctors,
they all their shit,

750
00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:18.220
it's great meeting a stand.
So it's uh,
it's on my youtube channel.

751
00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:22.930
So if you go to youtube and just look for Tom Segura,

752
00:50:23.290 --> 00:50:26.080
it's up there.
It's nine and a half minutes.
It's really well written,

753
00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.200
really well made,
and there's great

754
00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:32.790
<v 1>actors in it.
Uh,

they are on Australia's at sunrise show for us.

835
00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:40.010
We've had separate boyfriends in the past and it hasn't work but now it's much

836
00:55:40.011 --> 00:55:44.420
easier and yeah,
it's great.
[inaudible] we're with each other 24 seven.

837
00:55:44.421 --> 00:55:45.171
Me and my sister,

838
00:55:45.171 --> 00:55:49.550
it's just must asiatica shared boyfriend cause we're always together according

839
00:55:49.551 --> 00:55:52.240
to Australian reports.
And if they're asked you in Darden,

840
00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:57.190
<v 0>what's with the eyebrows?
What's with everything with the lifts,</v>

841
00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:01.900
the eyebrows,
the wipes on your standard issue with I can't focus with the lips.

842
00:56:02.050 --> 00:56:04.990
I can't focus because the eyebrows.
Yeah,
the lips are distracting to me.

843
00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:08.040
I'm looking at them like I fucking don't know what's going on at the time.

844
00:56:08.041 --> 00:56:08.500
But she just,

845
00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:13.500
they just took sharpies and like the Chola brow cause they're trying to fit that

846
00:56:13.871 --> 00:56:15.250
ideal.
They're there,
they're there,

847
00:56:15.251 --> 00:56:19.710
they see the car dash and things and so damaged [inaudible] please.

848
00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:23.690
So damaged.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No,
I'd be Bobby.
Yeah.

849
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:28.300
<v 16>Seeing their future.
If one gets pregnant and the other will follow suit.</v>

850
00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:31.000
So their bodies stay exactly the same.

851
00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:36.370
<v 10>Yeah.
So they're both dating the same guy,</v>

852
00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:40.150
so he's dumping clips left and right on both of them.

853
00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:41.680
I guess that's the only plus,

854
00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:45.440
but isn't that the big fantasy for a guide to be bagging twins?
Yeah,

855
00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:48.160
but this is the rare occasion where the trends are really want to do that.

856
00:56:48.161 --> 00:56:52.480
Most twins go,
yeah,
they go groves and I want to have my own,

857
00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:54.970
you know,
boyfriends elsewhere.
Yeah.
Yeah.

858
00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.880
I like one person's come and meet like my own.

859
00:56:58.320 --> 00:56:59.970
<v 1>Yeah.
You don't really want to share it.</v>

860
00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:04.260
It like it's really private and these two are real.
I mean,
they must,
yeah.

861
00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:06.210
They might even do that whole other,

862
00:57:06.211 --> 00:57:09.270
like maybe they're like incestuous and they're just,
they might be,

863
00:57:09.271 --> 00:57:12.030
I don't know why these girls just don't make the leap into porn.

864
00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:15.900
I kind of feel like that's on the table that's coming up.
Yeah.

865
00:57:15.930 --> 00:57:17.970
They're only there one phone call away from it.

866
00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:22.210
<v 10>Yeah.
Do you think they might be one phone call away from the,</v>

867
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:26.770
the greatest porn leap of all time?
That no one's ever gotten anyone to do,

868
00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:31.480
and that is to get them to be with each other.
No one's ever gotten that.
No.

869
00:57:31.481 --> 00:57:34.780
I think with the thing is they've had twins do porn,
but twins,
you know,

870
00:57:34.781 --> 00:57:37.900
siblings typically won't touch each other.
Oh,

871
00:57:37.901 --> 00:57:41.900
you've thoroughly researched this genre,
like you've done the research.
Yeah.

872
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:46.000
And I think these two would actually go.
Yeah,
no problem.
Yeah.

873
00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:51.020
I'll eat out my identical twin sister.
Yeah,
there's some of that going.
Yeah.
Yeah.

874
00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:51.680
It's weird.

875
00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:54.370
They're definitely a weird look how long I've gone without burping right now.

876
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:56.860
Can we just acknowledge that,
for instance,
shitting for that matter.

877
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:58.420
I haven't shit since before the show.

878
00:57:59.170 --> 00:58:02.890
I know it's been a whole hour and a half since your last,
it's a big deal.

879
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:04.830
It's amazing.
Can we

880
00:58:05.050 --> 00:58:08.260
<v 1>RFCs want the twins explained?
They're not ready just yet.</v>

881
00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:11.920
We're on whether they're trying for identical babies as well.

882
00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:14.340
Just imagine as I pulled up just as far as rent.

883
00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:16.460
This is like the dumb girl dance till,

884
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:19.510
cause it's so funny how it changes every decade.
Like this is,

885
00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:22.780
this is the dumb girl prototype.
Yeah.
And they're like,
you've got it.

886
00:58:22.810 --> 00:58:27.250
You've got to check off the list,
right?
Yeah.
Dumb girl.
Hair check,
lips check,

887
00:58:27.251 --> 00:58:31.370
eyebrows check.
Uh,
dress check,
check.
Yep.
Uh,

888
00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:34.990
and the dumb girl move the party girl dance.
It's,

889
00:58:35.010 --> 00:58:38.050
is there a manual that all of these people consult or,
yeah.

890
00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:40.870
It seems like it in there.
They're getting loaded in the room.

891
00:58:40.871 --> 00:58:45.610
Let's go shop fucked drop in our robot by way.
All stars.

892
00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:53.420
<v 16>[inaudible] dot com I'm the saddest shot</v>

893
00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:58.580
<v 10>dancing in our hotel room that says dance.</v>

894
00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:03.260
Um,
well while that,
oh,
by the way,

895
00:59:03.530 --> 00:59:08.480
last time we had a succulent Chinese meal.
Yeah.
A remix and we thought,

896
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:12.320
you know,
it was pretty good.
It was,
it's actually really good.
You know,
it had,

897
00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:16.400
it had all the um,
like it's like,
uh,
I dunno.

898
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:20.990
Modern kind of dance vibe right to it.
Is it actually,
is it in the three,

899
00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:22.093
six one?

900
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:24.800
<v 0>I still have that up.
I don't know if it's in there.
If it isn't there,</v>

901
00:59:24.801 --> 00:59:26.820
I can play it.
Um,

902
00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:33.620
it looks like I'm finally kicking in.
I feel like so inferior.

903
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:38.240
Inadequate.
Why do you feel that you've had all the verbs?

904
00:59:39.370 --> 00:59:44.330
Jet Jaw hods off blog post.
Here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna get my Ted Stein.

905
00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:48.470
I have to get my eyebrows.
Yeah.
Plastered in.

906
00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:50.930
I got to get my lips injected.
Dao.

907
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:57.410
God thought loads.
Fuck it's not there.
Anyways,

908
00:59:57.650 --> 01:00:02.480
we got a new one.
This is a totally different style.

909
01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:06.410
Get your hands off my penis song.
This one's really good and really different.

910
01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.200
Do you care to hear?
I'd love to.
I love this guy.

911
01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:14.720
Good your hands off my opinion.
US.
There we go.

912
01:01:08.850 --> 01:01:09.683
<v 9>Aw</v>

913
01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:14.550
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

914
01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:15.780
<v 7>Got It.</v>

915
01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:58.410
<v 0>I give the all day.
It's really good.
Yeah.
That's impressive.
Yeah.</v>

916
01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:03.440
I'm really impressed with him.
Good job.
Good job.
Good job.
Blue Band.

917
01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:08.040
Good job.
Great jeans,
jeans,
jeans,

918
01:02:08.041 --> 01:02:09.300
jeans are so tight on that.

919
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:13.200
Also want to point out how long it's been since I've burbs.
How long has it been?

920
01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:16.710
It feels like it's been a long time.
I have a gene dilemma.

921
01:02:16.711 --> 01:02:20.240
Maybe you can help me with.
Oh,
sure.
I'm,
I have a gene problem.

922
01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:24.330
<v 1>Okay.
Um,
no.
My post birth body,</v>

923
01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.110
I'm a little fatter than I've been in the past and I,
I've,

924
01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:31.680
I buy regular people jeans but I'm kind of like in this gene dilemma or

925
01:02:33.530 --> 01:02:37.980
like the ones I bought her two big but then when I go a size down it's too
tight.

926
01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:41.960
So what do I do?
I've been there a lot.
I've been there for years.

927
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.560
Like I'm in between sizes.

928
01:02:43.561 --> 01:02:47.100
So what pair of jeans do I wear it in the meantime always there.

929
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:52.190
I know exactly what you're talking about cause one pair it's too high and tight.

930
01:02:52.711 --> 01:02:57.470
If I were the lower size and then there are low and loose,
if I were the,

931
01:02:57.590 --> 01:02:58.710
the the size of mine

932
01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.160
<v 10>can't do the low end loose,
I would tell them a little snug.</v>

933
01:03:02.161 --> 01:03:06.630
What I try to do is then you get something a little tight to little higher than

934
01:03:06.631 --> 01:03:08.370
you normally wear it.
They don't tighter

935
01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:14.100
<v 1>and you just suffer through some tight hours and then it kind of loosens later</v>

936
01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:19.390
in the day.
But if it just loosens ever so slightly,

937
01:03:19.391 --> 01:03:21.160
it feels like it's almost made for you at that point.

938
01:03:21.850 --> 01:03:25.270
Then you wear it for a few days and it'll fit perfectly day after day.

939
01:03:25.271 --> 01:03:27.910
You have to power through those really high and tight.

940
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:31.090
Oh there it will not share that with everybody.

941
01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:35.830
<v 10>But I started to feel bad for them.
But the thing is,</v>

942
01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:39.970
yeah,
you gotta be ready for some uncomfortable times,

943
01:03:40.570 --> 01:03:45.520
but what happens is eventually it'll be perfect

944
01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:47.710
<v 1>cause now eventually if you keep wearing them,</v>

945
01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:51.190
they'll eventually get loose and sagging and I have to go another size down.

946
01:03:51.610 --> 01:03:55.780
The thing is is that you just can't sit down and you're high and tight jeans and

947
01:03:55.781 --> 01:03:59.790
you can't eat.
As long as I don't sit or eat those jeans feel it.

948
01:03:59.791 --> 01:04:01.360
The kind of feel nice one,
they're high and tight.

949
01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:04.060
When we were talking about this like Sundays,

950
01:04:04.061 --> 01:04:06.700
you like your jeans extra high and tight and Sundays I don't.

951
01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:11.940
<v 10>Yeah,
I mean pretty much I liked him high and tight.
You know</v>

952
01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:12.970
<v 1>all the time.</v>

953
01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:17.110
Nobody knows all the time but can have their jeans high and tight all the time.

954
01:04:17.590 --> 01:04:22.590
<v 10>It's pretty.
It's pretty much a lot though.
It's a lot.
Uh,</v>

955
01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:27.040
would you like to care to read some emails?
Yeah.
Hey Mommy.
Tom and mommy.
Tina,

956
01:04:27.041 --> 01:04:29.170
a longtime listener.
Lifelong Dany Yak here.

957
01:04:29.530 --> 01:04:31.780
I've got my denim and a bit of a twist.

958
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:36.580
My partner recently farted during intercourse.
What else?

959
01:04:36.581 --> 01:04:39.070
Know how to feel about it?
Let me be clear.

960
01:04:39.071 --> 01:04:42.130
This fart came from Brown town and it smelled like chicken cream,

961
01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:47.470
mid flow into relations.
Just want to get you a,

962
01:04:47.471 --> 01:04:52.360
your guts opinion on the matter and if coital farts are acceptable.

963
01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:57.490
Fyi,
I have also asked Hiller about this,
but he has a reply to any of my emails.

964
01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:00.940
Many thanks Mr. Reckless eyeballing them.

965
01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:05.140
<v 1>Well,
here's the thing.
Hitler doesn't answer your emails.
He only answers vlogs.</v>

966
01:05:05.170 --> 01:05:08.990
Yeah,
that's true.
Yeah,
that's true.
That's kind of some,

967
01:05:09.350 --> 01:05:12.830
some JV shit too.
First of all,
uh,

968
01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:17.370
farts happen in relationship.
I think we hold them in during lovemaking.
Yeah.

969
01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.100
I mean,

970
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.290
<v 0>first of all,
I want to,
I just want to clarify.</v>

971
01:05:20.291 --> 01:05:24.520
I'm pretty sure you're talking about,
um,

972
01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:27.880
somebody who accidentally farted.
I mean,

973
01:05:27.881 --> 01:05:31.840
that's a big thing where we're talking about an accidental 40 and disgusting.

974
01:05:31.930 --> 01:05:36.930
But the thing I want to also make clear is there's an accidental fart less.

975
01:05:40.391 --> 01:05:41.860
You're a real piece of shit.

976
01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:47.140
You forgive and accidental farm to the accident.
Now is it acceptable?

977
01:05:47.141 --> 01:05:50.440
Well,
it's acceptable that it happened accidentally.
You know,

978
01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:54.570
if it's a repeat or a deliberate thing,
that's a different thing,
you know?
Yeah.

979
01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:58.320
We should make every effort to hold in your pharmacy to try to hold him for it.

980
01:05:58.340 --> 01:05:59.650
I mean,
look how long I've been with you.

981
01:05:59.830 --> 01:06:02.860
I've held in all those parts and I've had to Fart a lot.

982
01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:06.420
There have been times where it's come close.
Yeah,
for sure.
Yeah.

983
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.210
Down to the fire wire.
Yeah.
You still hold it in.

984
01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:16.450
You still hold it.
Hold on his best.
Of course you do.
Fuck my stoma.

985
01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:18.520
But do you,

986
01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:28.810
you still,
um,
do you,
do you then go to the bathroom and then

987
01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.600
only,
or I hold it until we're done.

988
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:41.590
Let's say that I have it.
Yeah.
I mean I've had them where I go right to the end,

989
01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:44.750
live over and then you know,

990
01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:51.250
I know you and I have been making sweet merit alive and then you immediately

991
01:06:51.521 --> 01:06:56.521
fart after [inaudible]

992
01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:02.950
and then you go,
ah,
we just made love and I go,

993
01:07:02.951 --> 01:07:06.040
I know we're done.
That's how you know are done.

994
01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:11.800
Parts were done.
It's true.
It means we're totally done.

995
01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:16.450
You're totally wait until our son cause you've been burping in front of him.

996
01:07:17.050 --> 01:07:20.530
He's too young to really know what's happening but when he figures it out it's

997
01:07:20.531 --> 01:07:25.180
going to be fucking mayhem in this house.
Yeah.

998
01:07:25.181 --> 01:07:29.240
I ripped him big burbs in front of them.
Big farts to first.

999
01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:33.140
Only Cuban knows where they come from.
Purpose.
He looks at me and I go,
ah.

1000
01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:37.750
He's like
the little jeans is going to pick up.

1001
01:07:37.751 --> 01:07:40.900
Some bad habits would change between mom and dad were going to get a lot of

1002
01:07:40.901 --> 01:07:41.890
phone calls from school,

1003
01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:46.870
your son and he farted and then he said,

1004
01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:51.430
dammit,
I wish I had burped at the same time and we'll be like,
well yeah,

1005
01:07:51.431 --> 01:07:52.630
it's pretty big deal when you do that.

1006
01:07:54.490 --> 01:07:59.170
Your son has been farting on girls' hands and then we have to pretend like,

1007
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:02.070
oh yeah,
that is build really well.
He probably likes her,
you know,

1008
01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:05.470
he's tried to show her,
Hey Hitler,
mommies.

1009
01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:07.540
I was listening to a boring news story in NPR,

1010
01:08:07.541 --> 01:08:10.750
just a few hours go to immediately thought of you guys just as it was ending.

1011
01:08:11.110 --> 01:08:15.890
The story was about the current over abundance of cotton in China

1012
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:18.200
<v 10>and how it may affect the global economy.</v>

1013
01:08:18.650 --> 01:08:21.940
After some talking about the price supply,
demand import exports to statistics,

1014
01:08:21.941 --> 01:08:26.390
some statistics are how to read two sticks of cotton who went on.

1015
01:08:26.391 --> 01:08:31.391
The hint that we as American consumers can expect to see a price drop for

1016
01:08:31.881 --> 01:08:36.380
clothing,
specifically genes sometime in the near future.

1017
01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:40.670
Since everybody knows that Tom and Christina are the utmost authority when it

1018
01:08:40.671 --> 01:08:44.510
comes to jeans and anything else den unrelated,
I felt as a,

1019
01:08:44.511 --> 01:08:49.100
why am h listener of two years to keep you abreast with this new information?

1020
01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:52.700
I know I could really do with some denim,
more denim in my life personally,

1021
01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:56.990
so it'd be great to see the price go down for a new pair of those precious ball

1022
01:08:56.991 --> 01:09:00.820
crushing jeans.
Shout out to FIFA Betsy,
and little choppy though.

1023
01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:05.000
Keep in mind tight later.
Mommy's Michael from New York.
Thanks Michael.

1024
01:09:05.130 --> 01:09:07.020
<v 1>Oh,
if I could put a call out there.
Guys,</v>

1025
01:09:07.021 --> 01:09:11.160
any ladies out there know of any really good genes for when you're kind of still

1026
01:09:11.161 --> 01:09:12.800
fat postpartum?
Me Some.

1027
01:09:12.810 --> 01:09:15.810
What are some good genes to make a lady look a little skinnier and who has a

1028
01:09:15.811 --> 01:09:18.960
belly right now?
I go to the gap,
but I feel like there's,

1029
01:09:18.961 --> 01:09:21.360
there was a brand of there.
I'm not aware of that I should be checking out.

1030
01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:23.870
They're going to respond.
Let me know.
Girls,

1031
01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:26.550
if you've had a baby and I don't want to wear maternity jeans anymore,

1032
01:09:26.551 --> 01:09:30.360
it's too depressing.
The Alibaba total region.
Any normal people,
genes.

1033
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:31.770
Just like fat people.
James,

1034
01:09:32.310 --> 01:09:35.580
<v 10>dear mommy,
Mommy's just want to let you know I no longer listen to the podcast.</v>

1035
01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:40.490
Nope.
I am now a proud of viewer of your youtube podcasts.
Yes.
Scared.

1036
01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:43.730
I now get the pleasure of seeing my mommy's wearing it high and tight.

1037
01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:46.880
No longer do I wonder is chem and hot as far as the,

1038
01:09:46.881 --> 01:09:51.881
how does they say what the fuck's a sky punch or I bet they break it down during

1039
01:09:52.101 --> 01:09:54.440
that sweet intro,
which you do.
Thank you.

1040
01:09:54.441 --> 01:09:58.820
Mommy's for not giving me the option of sitting at home and doing a bowl with my

1041
01:09:58.821 --> 01:10:03.110
two main mommy's keeping them high and tight.
Jeff.
Good.
Good Jab.

1042
01:10:03.111 --> 01:10:05.000
Hi Jeff.
I'm glad you're watching us.

1043
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:09.100
This is definitely for you and it made me really laugh.
Hey hillers,

1044
01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:12.410
I listen to your podcasts.
Found something interesting about Tina's dad.

1045
01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:14.570
Mostly about her dad's drinking.

1046
01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:19.960
My Dad is also from the old country and would drink a 30 pack a day starting as

1047
01:10:21.201 --> 01:10:22.910
soon as he woke up.
Yeah.

1048
01:10:22.970 --> 01:10:26.390
I grew up thinking all dads did this too and never figured out that he was an

1049
01:10:26.391 --> 01:10:29.720
alcoholic until I was old enough to drink for myself.

1050
01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:35.080
He would also send me to fuck off until I was old enough to drink with him and

1051
01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:40.520
cool enough to hang.
I've never seen her drunk or pissy or a,
yeah,

1052
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:42.290
no matter what he drank.

1053
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:47.030
It seems to be a strange parallel between our high functioning alcoholic,

1054
01:10:47.031 --> 01:10:50.780
Hungarian father's love the show,
keep it high and tight.

1055
01:10:50.781 --> 01:10:52.950
Tanner Tanner,

1056
01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:55.950
<v 1>first of all,
that's a very odd Hungarian name they gave you,
but yeah,</v>

1057
01:10:56.710 --> 01:10:58.020
you're absolutely correct.
Yeah.

1058
01:10:58.021 --> 01:11:02.460
It's normal to grow up with the dads I guess is considered quote alcoholism,

1059
01:11:02.490 --> 01:11:05.730
but if her dad's from the old country,
Huh?
Yeah,
it's just,

1060
01:11:05.731 --> 01:11:08.130
it's just how they roll.
That's why seriously,

1061
01:11:08.131 --> 01:11:12.090
like I remember in high school confronting my dad,
I'd be like,
Dad,

1062
01:11:12.091 --> 01:11:13.940
I think I think might be an alcoholic,

1063
01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:17.570
and him and my step mother looked at me like I was an idiot.
Retarded.

1064
01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:21.780
Like what are you talking about?
You know,
alcoholics are falling down,

1065
01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:26.120
falling down and pat and kind.
I kind of agree.
You know what I mean?
If you,

1066
01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:29.220
my dad got his ass up for work every morning at the crack of dawn,

1067
01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:30.420
fixing forklifts,

1068
01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.390
made a great living and had a great life and he never changed his mood.
Was He?

1069
01:11:34.530 --> 01:11:38.100
In fact,
I would even argue my dad doesn't drink now.

1070
01:11:38.170 --> 01:11:42.000
I would even argue he was more fun when he did drink and I kind of liked his

1071
01:11:42.001 --> 01:11:44.970
personality even more when he was a drinker.
You use it like,
Dad,

1072
01:11:44.971 --> 01:11:46.560
I want to talk to you about something.
When I was a teenager,

1073
01:11:46.561 --> 01:11:49.770
I had the audacity to try and uh,
you know,

1074
01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:53.310
straightened them out about alcoholism because I learned that Horse Shit at

1075
01:11:53.311 --> 01:11:55.920
school,
you know?
Yeah.
And they just laughed at me.

1076
01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:59.640
I was laughed at completely like,
what are you talking about?

1077
01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.250
There's not a fucking alcoholic.
Come on.
This will stupid alcohol.

1078
01:12:03.251 --> 01:12:06.210
Luke's who had passed out all day long.
Even I have an,

1079
01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:09.840
I have a relative that has passed out drunk,
alcoholic and even they were like,

1080
01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:13.130
she's not an alcoholic if you're just close to doing it.
I'm like,
okay,
okay.

1081
01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:18.030
Because all countries,
I know though that that's not correct.
Right.
You know,

1082
01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:20.670
the older I get,
especially in the business where out,

1083
01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:24.460
there's a lot of people that use substances and can function high functioning

1084
01:12:24.461 --> 01:12:27.640
yet.
And if you can function but doesn't mean you're not a problem.
Yeah.

1085
01:12:27.641 --> 01:12:31.290
You're addicted to something your,
if you're functional.
Yeah.
You know,

1086
01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:34.320
fucking Mazal Tov.
Good for you.
All right.
In Charlotte.

1087
01:12:34.530 --> 01:12:39.120
But in Sharla and Mazal Tov together,
all those things together.
Uh,
God bless.

1088
01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:43.650
God bless.
God bless.
God bless.
Yeah.
That's so funny Tanner.

1089
01:12:43.930 --> 01:12:48.300
Um,
speaking of Hungarian,
uh,
the,
I think there's some Hungarian in this,

1090
01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:52.230
there's a wonderful site called he fucked that has over the years provided us,

1091
01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:53.420
oh,
I know what this is.

1092
01:12:53.421 --> 01:12:57.170
This is like one of those online community college college thing.

1093
01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:59.880
So they do a lot of great work.
Um,
so this,

1094
01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:03.300
<v 17>oh,
there's no visual format.
Well,
there's a visual,</v>

1095
01:13:03.301 --> 01:13:06.750
I still think it would really fly.
Oh,
I need tubes.
Well,
yeah,

1096
01:13:07.170 --> 01:13:09.580
it gets a little fucking crazy.

1097
01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:14.270
<v 1>So they,
the guy,
the guy who really has editing chops,
he makes,</v>

1098
01:13:15.410 --> 01:13:18.180
he makes,
he blends of horrific things with.

1099
01:13:19.190 --> 01:13:20.670
<v 11>Okay.
But I'm pretty sure it's</v>

1100
01:13:29.610 --> 01:13:30.443
<v 18>PAC</v>

1101
01:13:34.730 --> 01:13:37.010
spanking around her,
but that was his.

1102
01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:43.480
<v 17>Okay.
Right now</v>

1103
01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:48.640
<v 1>he has her,
he's,
he has her arms tied behind her back.</v>

1104
01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.710
I guess he's reading a new pair of sound.

1105
01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:55.530
He's reading a newspaper and she's eating his ass.
Okay.
Shawna,

1106
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:57.490
text me.
Maybe I can answer this.

1107
01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:02.980
Can you use this one so that we get,
I can show you something on this.
Okay.
So,

1108
01:14:03.010 --> 01:14:03.990
okay.
He's a,

1109

<v 7>word.</v>

1111

Okay.

Hold on.</v>

1112
01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:20.403

1113
01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:26.963
<v 6>no.</v>

01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:33.670
<v 1>Too much.
I want to say on a,</v>

1115
01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:36.650

1117
01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:46.670
It's okay.

1118
01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:54.940
<v 7>No,
I think it might
top</v>

1119
01:14:59.830 --> 01:15:04.750
not a lot of talking to you.
I'd like to help you on this translation.
Right?

1120
01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:10.440
<v 18>Hello?
Hey.

1121
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:15.930
Sue can meld.
That's French,
right?

1122
01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:18.750
I think it's right.

1123
01:15:19.650 --> 01:15:23.330
<v 1>But Goodbye Cordova is a whore.
Yes.
That is,
that is hungry.
But she thrived.</v>

1124
01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:27.610
I think she's Hungarian.
Ah,
words again.
Okay,

1125
01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:30.450
so he's saying whore and that's Russia and I think,

1126
01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:34.050
or check or his mother.
It's definitely not,

1127
01:15:34.051 --> 01:15:37.710
he's not the core devise a Garren word.
Okay.
But the rest is not.
I don't,

1128
01:15:37.711 --> 01:15:39.000
unless I don't know these words.

1129
01:15:39.090 --> 01:15:42.300
<v 18>It's what did you bitch?
Huh?</v>

1130
01:15:43.230 --> 01:15:47.610
She's just Q bud girl.

1131
01:15:47.970 --> 01:15:48.803
You'll not too.

1132
01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:52.800
<v 1>If speaking to he's doing,</v>

1133
01:15:52.801 --> 01:15:54.750
he was such a bad accent that I can understand what you're saying.

1134
01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:57.310
Really fucking brutal.
Yeah.
Oh,
what's today?

1135
01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:00.690
It's really too bad we can't watch it.
It's really a lot to watch,
right?

1136
01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:04.780
It sounds like a lot.
It looks like blue bands not interested in

1137
01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:10.070
<v 3>I told to be interchanged.
Yeah.
He was solid for a minute.</v>

1138
01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:15.770
He's never saw him like that.
Why do people do that in the world?

1139
01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:18.313
I agree.

1140
01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:21.340
<v 1>Um,
this is another reason why it makes you,</v>

1141
01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:27.400
<v 3>I think the real can we discuss the real thing</v>

1142
01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:30.340
<v 1>is that two people in the normal people in the room are like,</v>

1143
01:16:31.090 --> 01:16:34.810
and you think it's hilarious?
No,
I thought it was bad.
Yeah.
I thought it was fun.

1144
01:16:34.811 --> 01:16:37.990
It's why you're choking and laughing as of his reaction.
Yeah.

1145
01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:43.700
Two of these kids are having healthy reactions.
One of them isn't

1146
01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:49.080
what parts of funniest to you where she's choking or being called a whore and

1147
01:16:49.170 --> 01:16:52.690
Cordoba.
Yeah.
Good.
Was horror.
Yeah.

1148
01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:59.020
<v 12>What's going on?
Hey,

Whoa.</v>

1149
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.040
Oh my God.
Oh My god,

1150
01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:10.280

1152
01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:16.873
Uh,

1153
01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:21.950
Sweden sour sauce.

1154
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:27.650
<v 10>Maria,

1157
01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:42.850
<v 1>I just,
I don't need it in my life.
I don't know why you're bringing it in.</v>

1158
01:17:42.851 --> 01:17:46.250
In my world,
there's so much shit I don't need to know.

1159
01:17:47.010 --> 01:17:50.630
Like I have such a finite amount of space in my brain and this is not

1160
01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:51.493
necessarily,

1161
01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:54.710
<v 10>there's a really funny part.
So</v>

1162
01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:01.770
Tyson age,
younger Asian person,

1163
01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:06.240
the Asian transsexual is doing the work.

Has the penis in the Bot hall.

1165
01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:12.850
The other person is,

1166
01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:14.850
is making okay.

1167
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Kind of racial remarks as she's getting plowed by an Asian transsexual.

1168
01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:26.220
Does that make sense now?
No,
I mean again,

Fuck me so far.

<v 4>Okay.</v>

1191
01:19:45.951 --> 01:19:50.120
Diggy diggy charm to change a change a chain.
Tiggy tiggy how's it?
Good Song.

1192
01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:54.440
You like kid rock?
I never knew you were that tight.
Now I just,

1193
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:55.303
I just remember that.
Yeah.

1194
01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:59.560
<v 10>Oh,
I've got to do a filler up sealer shot cocktail.
Oh Shit.</v>

1195
01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:04.120
We hired you Jane Chicken Cheeky.
Okay.
The fill her up.

1196
01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:08.310
Seal her shut.
So harsh.
So we need

1197
01:20:08.490 --> 01:20:13.080
<v 0>new song.
It's not copywritten by Mexican Mariachi band.
Yeah.</v>

1198
01:20:13.170 --> 01:20:17.820
Here we go.
So mission number one from Ethan.
What do you think?

1199
01:20:17.970 --> 01:20:22.500
Fill her up and seal her shot.
Here we go.

1200
01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:43.690
<v 6>It's good.</v>

1201
01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:48.830
<v 0>It's um,
it's,
it's good.
It's like a version of a popular song though,
right?</v>

1202
01:20:48.831 --> 01:20:50.750
It's like just just right.

1203
01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:53.900
It's like a tweaked or no death cab for cutie tight and then his,

1204
01:20:53.930 --> 01:20:57.850
his audio didn't seem clear to me.
Yeah.
It's a little hard to hear.

1205
01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:01.230
If that was fixed,
we need to get it fixed.
If we picked that song.

1206
01:21:01.650 --> 01:21:05.890
It's just a clear [inaudible] on that sing song.
All right,
well I still like it.

1207
01:21:06.410 --> 01:21:09.740
I like that a lot.

You know,
it's good,</v>

1211
01:21:30.051 --> 01:21:33.110
simple and we don't have anything with a country Western vibe,

1212
01:21:33.111 --> 01:21:36.980
so it really differentiates itself from the other themes we have.
Yup.

1213
01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:40.820
I do like that.
I do like that.

She'll her side.

1221
01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:32.100
<v 0>It's kind of like a crossover kind of new wave sort of feelings.</v>

1222
01:22:33.070 --> 01:22:33.903
