Dylan as well,
which I know you garbage garbage means.

83
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:29.890

84
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.800
who liked them and they've told me before and they're like,

he's the best and you're a garbage person.

86
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.540

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.950
And he just sings about his hometown and stuff.

92
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.860
<v 5>with a big smile on my face,
I would tell you Springsteen's shit,</v>

93
00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.690
Dylan's garbage and,
uh,
what's his last one?
Billy Joel can go fuck his mother.

94
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.640
Sure.
Um,
so yeah,
if you're,
if you're watching right now,

95
00:07:08.641 --> 00:07:13.540
you're like,
what happened to the set?
Well,
you know,
we were riding high a week.

96
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.500
It wasn't just how life goes.
Okay.
We,
we were pretty excited.

97
00:07:16.501 --> 00:07:17.334
I'm not going to lie.

98
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.540
I mean here we have one of the biggest corporations in the world gives us is

99
00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:22.470
huge check.

100
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.850
All we have to do is paint the set their colors right.

101
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.750
And um,
well that's what they said.
That's what they said.
And I do,

102
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.710
I want to be clear about something where was a lot of conversations ahead of

103
00:07:34.711 --> 00:07:38.820
time before we were working with Mcdonald's about our content and they were
like,

104
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:43.620
yeah,
like let,
let it,
let it go wherever you want to go.
And then,
uh,

105
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:48.720
I called and I said,
too,
there are age.
And I said,
well,
you know,

106
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:50.063
have they,

107
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.550
<v 4>here's what we do.
Or we asked them like,
did they do their due diligence?</v>

108
00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:57.570
What I go through our social media,
did they go,
this is what I was told.

109
00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.860
I was like,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And then later on I,

110
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:03.610
<v 5>I feel like,
well,
what was,
they're like,
oh,
they're familiar with you guys.</v>

111
00:08:03.611 --> 00:08:06.310
Stand up.
And I'm like,
okay.
And they'll look at your stand up.

112
00:08:06.311 --> 00:08:10.390
They have no problem with,
I'm like,
yeah,
but you know that this isn't stand up,

113
00:08:10.391 --> 00:08:15.160
right.
Yeah.
We're doing a different type of show and he goes,

114
00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:18.040
uh,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
no,
it's fine.
And they,
they,
they clear.

115
00:08:18.041 --> 00:08:23.041
Basically they didn't want the agents didn't want to press and find a reason to

116
00:08:23.801 --> 00:08:28.270
upset them.
So here's a,
here's the deal man.

117
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:32.050
Uh,
he's a deal guy.
It's such a bummer.
We got,
uh,

118
00:08:32.051 --> 00:08:37.051
we got fired from Mcdonald's over last week's episode in a phone call,

119
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:42.760
like almost like within hours of the show coming out.

120
00:08:42.761 --> 00:08:47.761
So that came out on video on Wednesday and it was like Wednesday afternoon and

121
00:08:47.771 --> 00:08:48.880
they were like,
oh,
you're done.

122
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:52.620
<v 4>And then it was a whole shit show.
I mean,
it was so fast.
It's like the,</v>

123
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.770
I got a voicemail happened,
so I know,

124
00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:59.140
but can I just process with you a little bit?
I mean,
today is Monday.

125
00:08:59.220 --> 00:08:59.641
What it does,

126
00:08:59.641 --> 00:09:03.630
it Mondays we're recording and a man just fucking ruined my whole weekend

127
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:08.700
getting this.
Well,
you have to imagine,
I mean,
they gave us two point $3 million.

128
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.210
And for people who are like,
Oh,
you just get the pocket that will know the,

129
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:17.190
it was going to basically finance the studio probably for a few years.

130
00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:23.130
Sets.
Yeah.
Employees,
insurance,
utilities.
Yeah.

131
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.630
Like everyone's salaries.
All the equipment.
It was like set up to do all of that.

132
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.750
Plus we got already,
you know,
picked up some fun items too.
Yeah.

133
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:37.500
Yeah.
I want a new car.
Yeah.
I thought we were going to get a Lamborghini finally.

134
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:42.270
I know
blue man was looking at a house.
Yeah.

135
00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:46.320
He was like,
oh,
like a member right before the episode last week.
He goes,

136
00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:49.980
uh hey man,
this is really cool.
I'll probably have my own house.
Yeah.

137
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.520
And like maybe I could settle down.
And I was like,
oh,
that's great.
Yeah.

138
00:09:53.521 --> 00:09:56.850
I'm thinking like,
well yeah,
I mean Mcdonald's is going to pay for it,
you know?

139
00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.910
Yeah.
It's always hard getting fired.

140
00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:03.330
I'm not even sure I can hear this voice mail again.
I'm,
you know,
it's still,

141
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.290
it hurts,
but here it is for everybody to know this is what happened.
This is,

142
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:10.950
this is what I get Wednesday afternoon.
Okay.

143
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:16.180
<v 8>Tom,
this is Darren gearing Wisco second in command entertainment division at the</v>

144
00:10:16.181 --> 00:10:17.350
Mcdonald's corporation.

145
00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:21.970
I'm calling to inform you that Mcdonald's is canceling our sponsorship of your

146
00:10:21.971 --> 00:10:24.760
show,
your mom's house podcast.
We are,

147
00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:29.710
we were dismayed to say the least that you were so called entertainment content

148
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.740
when we said that you could do whatever you wanted.

149
00:10:32.741 --> 00:10:37.741
We didn't imagine in our wildest dreams that you would include a man reviewing

150
00:10:37.781 --> 00:10:42.781
of butt plug and having a cool ruined orgasm is you laugh like a lunatic.

151
00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:48.310
And the other guys that you see truth,
the cool guys,
they're not cool.

152
00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.800
They're very not cool.

153
00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:56.380
We're demanding the return of the two point $3 million we gave you and we

154
00:10:56.381 --> 00:11:00.910
request that you change the colors of the set come legal action may be taken if

155
00:11:00.911 --> 00:11:03.130
you refuse additional lien.

156
00:11:03.131 --> 00:11:06.460
Neither you nor Christina are welcoming to any southern California Mcdonald's

157
00:11:06.461 --> 00:11:09.610
location.
Good Day sir.

158
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.990
<v 4>That's it.
Mary goes,
fire you like that and a voicemail.</v>

159
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.930
And then I called,
I tried to call him back,

160
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.110
you know I had to call it through the agents and they were just like,
it's over,

161
00:11:21.111 --> 00:11:24.580
it's over.
So why are training,
I mean,

162
00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:28.580
I kind of do remember how Terry broke me.

163
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.530
Like Terry's a straw.
That video was a straw that broke your mom's house.

164
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:38.240
Here's the great irony that mother fucker's carry.
The great irony of it.
Okay.

165
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:44.050
In this is our 483rd episode of your mom's house in the previous 482 maybe four

166
00:11:48.471 --> 00:11:53.471
times I've done this where I so enjoyed moment on the podcast that I actually

167
00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:01.890
went back and had to watch or listen to again and again because I was laughing.

168
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.500
I was at joying.
It's,
it sounds gross,

169
00:12:05.501 --> 00:12:09.610
but I was enjoying so much what I went through that I wanted to see myself go

170
00:12:09.611 --> 00:12:13.360
through it again.
You mean my suffering?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And,

171
00:12:13.361 --> 00:12:17.320
and also like uncle Terry just doing this.
So

172
00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:22.810
I was so uncomfortable with that video and I can see why Mcdonald's was

173
00:12:22.811 --> 00:12:26.740
uncomfortable the way,
just so people know,
if you haven't seen it,

174
00:12:26.741 --> 00:12:30.540
if you want to see what I'm talking about,
why we got fired from Mcdonald's.

175
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:34.450
Well go to episode 42 it's the previous episode.

176
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:39.640
And if you go on Youtube,
go to the 49 minute mark.
Okay.

177
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:43.630
Go to the 49 minute mark and just watch for a few minutes.

178
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:48.690
And that is essentially a two point $3 million bit of laughing.

179
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:52.600
Yeah,
that's right.
That's $2 million.
Laughter.

180
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:57.490
$2 million to play that stupid stay.
That dumb fucking video.

181
00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:02.260
I hated.
I Hate Terry and I hate it.
Really hate them.
No,

182
00:13:02.261 --> 00:13:04.360
I know.
But yeah,

183
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:08.410
it was a depressing and I can't even step foot in a Mcdonald's anymore that were

184
00:13:08.411 --> 00:13:11.260
done as part.
I mean,
I didn't even know.
He's like,
you're not welcome.

185
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.560
Is he going to have our pictures up there?
And I don't know how that works.

186
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.470
Can we not in California has got to have a thousand of them.

187
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.050
You know what about the drive through?
Yeah,
they can't,

188
00:13:20.051 --> 00:13:24.760
they can't kick us out of a tribe.
No.
Oh,
it's so depressing.

189
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:29.880
Things.
I was going to buy fucking Terry man.
Fucking Terry.
Uh,

190
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:34.110
well I'll also,
before we further examine this,
um,

191
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:39.430
we have now created our own,
uh,
separate,
uh,
highlight channel.

192
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.340
It's clips of your mom's house.
So there's a,

193
00:13:42.341 --> 00:13:45.010
if you'd just like to watch the highlights or you want to send them around to

194
00:13:45.011 --> 00:13:47.740
friends or just see like the big moments.

195
00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:51.520
It's youtube.com/what your mom's house clips,

196
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.390
youtube.com/your mom's house clips and you can subscribe to that please.

197
00:13:55.391 --> 00:14:00.280
If you want to get those separate highlights from the episodes.

198
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:05.080
So we've had to change the set per the request of corporate and people are like,

199
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:06.730
oh,
it kind of looks like a steak house now.
Yeah.

200
00:14:06.731 --> 00:14:11.300
But that's because I had to go with my head down in the Mortons uh,

201
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:16.120
the one in the area.
And I said like,
you know,
is there anything you can do?

202
00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:18.820
If they gave us a couple of grand,
which is night and Morton's is great,

203
00:14:18.821 --> 00:14:21.180
I don't want to act like I'm not a fan.
Love Martin's.
I loved,

204
00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.220
they basically paid to paint it.
They paid.

205
00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.830
So Morton Sankey Morton steakhouse like you Morton steakhouse for sponsoring

206
00:14:26.831 --> 00:14:31.720
your mom's house.
Yeah,
they have a great iceberg wedge salad.

207
00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:36.370
I enjoy there.
And they have,
you know,
a Usda,
a wet and dry age beef.

208
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:40.480
It's good stuff.
It is.
It's good.
It's good.

209
00:14:40.481 --> 00:14:43.690
I don't want to act like I'm not appreciative of Morton.

210
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.930
And then painting the set and stuff.
What you said

211
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.970
is true.
What is the difference between a wet and a

212
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:56.090
<v 0>well,
I mean most people,
you know,
they'll go for the dry age.</v>

213
00:14:56.091 --> 00:15:00.230
The secret is that the wet is really better.
Yeah.
Why is that?
Well,

214
00:15:00.231 --> 00:15:01.390
I don't want to get into it.
Right.
Okay.

215
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.550
I'll have one of the Morton's reps kind of stop by.
Hey,

216
00:15:04.551 --> 00:15:07.810
that's the thing they can do next week.
Yeah,
sure.
Yeah.
Well,

217
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:11.210
like here's 100 bucks.
Is that what Mcdonald's gave you?
No,
it's not.
Sorry.

218
00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:15.920
I don't want to act like a dick.
But anyways,
um,
uh,
yeah.

219
00:15:15.921 --> 00:15:20.550
So Terry,
let's talk about it.
Oh,
what the carry the joy.
Yeah,

220
00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:24.020
the hardest I've ever laughed in a clip.
And at the same time,

221
00:15:24.021 --> 00:15:28.490
the most costly clip.
It is really nice.
But we have gone back and watched it.
No,

222
00:15:28.491 --> 00:15:31.340
I haven't gone back and watched it.
You've been watching it,

223
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:34.220
but the way he upsets you is what makes me,
here's what I cause.

224
00:15:34.221 --> 00:15:38.740
I thought about it and I was like,
why does Terry upset me like no other.
Yeah,

225
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:43.160
and I think what bothers me about him is his lack of shame.

226
00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.070
[inaudible] I mean no shame.

227
00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:50.000
This motherfucker is talking about putting stuff in his but talking about it,

228
00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.720
doing it,
doing it like he's Bobby flay,

229
00:15:53.721 --> 00:15:55.940
like doing like a chicken cutlet recipe,

230
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.920
<v 9>so we're going to do is going to take a a boneless skinless chicken breasts.</v>

231
00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:02.110
We're going to pound it out.

232
00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:07.890
I wanted to use this by greening super casual and try that.

233
00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:12.910
Try this.
Step one did fell asleep.
I don't want to make them do with it.

234
00:16:12.911 --> 00:16:15.690
I don't want it to be like a chicken pie it or like a chicken fried steak.

235
00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.070
I want it to have some explaining what I'm doing.

236
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.590
Maybe about going through what I'm going to do half an inch.

237
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.830
I'm not going to be able to use the vibrating park but that,
but Tony vibrating,

238
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.930
I mean casual Friday or whatever.
Now,

239
00:16:28.931 --> 00:16:31.260
what do you want to do is when you're making sugar apartment,
John,

240
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.340
do you want to set up sort of a station for yourself?

241
00:16:33.341 --> 00:16:35.590
It's almost like an assembly line.
Yeah.
What are you wanting to start with?

242
00:16:35.591 --> 00:16:39.490
Some much.
Wow.
What about you Terry?
The first,
I'm going to try and

243
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:46.570
turn it on and it's even got this cool little,
oh,
alright,

244
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.350
so you can take a little bit oil.
Just like he's dead.
Chicken Parmesan.

245
00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.090
You go to the Lord.
Very casual.
We're trying to accomplish here.

246
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.500
We just want to get the,
the,

247
00:16:53.501 --> 00:16:57.180
the chicken and the break rooms and be sort of Nice and Golden Brown,
so

248
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:04.050
to go slow.
Don't try and rush it.

249
00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:10.480
We want to cook the chicken too fast.
Try it again.
Yeah.
You take a peek.

250
00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.560
Take a peek.
Take a look.
Take your time as I love chicken recipe yet the Brown,

251
00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:18.970

Is it?
Give it a flip.
Let's see.
Take it out here.
I see the route.

252
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.180
Throw up.
Oh,

253
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:28.870

Case to some guy.
Just the other side.

254
00:17:28.871 --> 00:17:30.500
Just till the bread crumbs cook a little bit.
Yeah.

255
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.950
We're going to assemble the chicken Parmesan and finish it in the oven.
Perfect.

256
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.620
No,
no,

I don't want to call it.
Oh,

257
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.290

258
00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.020
oh,

259
00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.290
<v 4>That's enough.
Thank you.
By the way,
if you want to see what was,</v>

260
00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:56.070
if you could pull up the first Terry clip and this batch,

261
00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:01.410

um,

Yeah.

262
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.400
So if you see,
um,

263
00:18:05.401 --> 00:18:10.260
can you scroll to like go a little further there?
Okay.

264
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.390
See it sees,
Hey,

265
00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:17.370
That left hand move and he's got mcdonalds,

266
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:22.000
Oh,

They're like that.
They're like,
what the hell is that?
And I got,

267
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.230
I think he's got,
I told him I go,
I think he's got an itch and a,
that guy,

268
00:18:25.231 --> 00:18:28.210
Darren was like,
he's not fucking,
it doesn't have an itch.
He's holding a big Mac.

269
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:33.000
Yeah,
because he kept doing that.
They were like,

270
00:18:33.001 --> 00:18:35.530
that was like the straw they're

271
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:41.630
making himself.
I was like,
look,
right now I got an itchy legs.

272
00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:44.410
I'm just scratching my leg.
And then they got rid of,

273
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:48.930
I can understand why Mcdonald's is mad.
I want to eat.

274
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:51.720
I want doctor Giudice this just because you and I,

275
00:18:51.721 --> 00:18:56.721
it's sparked a debate is this extreme confidence and comfortable with one

276
00:18:57.721 --> 00:19:01.770
section,
which is my,
my vote.
I don't think so.
I think a lack of awareness,

277
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.340
as mad as I am at Terry boundaries for ruining our business.

278
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:10.380
You think lack of awareness,
lack of boundaries,
shameless shamelessness and I,

279
00:19:10.381 --> 00:19:10.771
and I,

280
00:19:10.771 --> 00:19:15.771
and I do get that in today's social media culture that there's less shame when

281
00:19:16.171 --> 00:19:19.830
it comes to reporting your personal life.
I feel differently.
I feel

282
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:25.530
liberated that the fact that he has no shame is something that should be

283
00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.070
celebrated and encouraged.
And not only that,

284
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:31.840
I find him to be the chairman of the Cool Guy Club.

285
00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.870
That's a cool guy,
is a cool guy.

286
00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:42.690
I like his electric guitar.
That's what cool guys kill the guys do,

287
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:47.550
do.
Um,
why do I feel Yucky watching Terry?
If it's a cool guy,

288
00:19:47.551 --> 00:19:52.530
he makes me feel yucky inside.
No,
I mean,
I feel pretty cool right now.

289
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:55.830
Feel cool.
I feel like we're,
when's Terrie gonna do another video?

290
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.650
That's the best part.
Like,
hey guys,
what's up?
It's scary.

291
00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:04.660
I'm just here to review the Qar reviewer who's like the brand new BMW Tom on

292
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:08.940
boxing this dildo.
It's so,
it's too casual.

293
00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:12.060
That's what goes talking about the Toyota supra.
I went today's competition.
Yeah,

294
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.490
I know.
He's a,
he's very comfortable.
I don't,

295
00:20:14.491 --> 00:20:17.900
I would actually like to hear what Dr drew says.
I think it's,

296
00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:21.090
I think he needs to have,
I think a little bit of shame is healthy.

297
00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.640
A little awareness and Blake,
what's proper to put on the,

298
00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:28.820
you just shouldn't put yourself on the Internet doing that.
I know.

299
00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:33.860
By the way,
if you are feeling generous,
maybe it's a good week to get some merge.

300
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:38.520
Um,
we kind of lost a lot of money,
so

301
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:45.180
we restocked some of the hot sellers and
yeah,
there's mugs,

302
00:20:45.181 --> 00:20:49.670
socks,
shirts,
hats,
everything.
There's some new stuff
coming to brown talk,

303
00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.110
you know what I mean?
Obviously I don't want to,
yeah,

304
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.990
whatever you can tell I want to push.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's just what,

305
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.640
just what happens when your show feature.

306
00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.073
<v 0>Cool guy.</v>

307
00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:02.870
So we have been going in the cool guy way.

308
00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:07.370
It's this show is a celebration of the coolest guys.
If you're thinking alarming.

309
00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:09.390
Yeah.
I don't like them at all.

310
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.600
But we talked about Terri as we went away on our,

311
00:21:12.601 --> 00:21:16.820
we redid our 10 year anniversary night.
Yes.
And we went,

312
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:18.240
we stayed somewhere lovely.

313
00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:23.690
And we had a marital loves [inaudible] and then we took a shower together.

314
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:29.220
Yeah.
Yeah it was nice.
This place we stayed at,
they had his and her showers,

315
00:21:29.221 --> 00:21:32.280
which was really,
it was,
it was cool.
We've never done that before.
Yeah.

316
00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:36.410
And Justice,
I'm pouring this lovely lavender shampoo and in my hands

317
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.030
that was the one we made that up.

318
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:43.500
But that's the originator of the cool guys were making love,
you know.

319
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:48.560
Oh I feel like this guy started the goal guy club.
Oh he's bit,
yeah,

320
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.490
try it out guy.
One of the,
no I think this guy is a pretty,

321
00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:57.630
he's also the founder rob.
That guy started.
Cool guy cause he's pretty cool.

322
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.930
He's the Oji right?
Yeah.

323
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.330
But then we did take it a little shyness is saying as I,

324
00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.240
I poured out some lavender shampoo to put on my hair.

325
00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.750
I was smelling the shampoo and I thought this is funny.

326
00:22:12.751 --> 00:22:15.990
This lavender doesn't smell good.
It smells off.
Yeah.

327
00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:21.180
And I looked at you and I go,
did you fart?
Yup.
Yes.

328
00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:26.160
I know you farted so badly in the shower.
And it was so sad cause I was like,

329
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:29.640
oh babe,
we should get one of these with our Mcdonald's money.
We should put this,

330
00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:32.100
this kind of shower in our house.
It's so romantic.

331
00:22:32.101 --> 00:22:34.830
We can talk about the show together and shower.
Yeah.

332
00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:39.300
<v 4>Bad.
Yeah.
That's a r.
T you farted so bad.</v>

333
00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:41.730
So bad.
It was so bad.

334
00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.390
It was much worse than I had anticipated,
but can't,

335
00:22:45.391 --> 00:22:48.360
couldn't you tell it was going to be stinky before I came out?
I didn't.
I didn't.

336
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:53.010
I didn't sense that was come.
If I knew what came out was in the chamber,

337
00:22:53.011 --> 00:22:57.480
I wouldn't have done it.
It was so horrific.
I Dunno.
I Dunno what it was.

338
00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.360
What that was the,
was that the morning one or the evening one?
No,

339
00:23:00.361 --> 00:23:04.190
it was a morning.
I thought.
No,
no shit.
That was evenings.
No,

340
00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:09.030
no morning cause I was washing my hair.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Uh,

341
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:13.830
bad fish the night before.
Filet a fish maybe.
No.

342
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:20.260
<v 0>Yeah,
that was cool.
And then,
um,
it was a bad,
bad.
It was a bad fart.
So thanks.</v>

343
00:23:20.261 --> 00:23:21.850
And then,
uh,

344
00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.200
we haven't been close to each other shitting in a long time since I was

345
00:23:26.201 --> 00:23:27.660
Silverlake days.
Yeah.

346
00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:32.740
And it was really neat because right next to the bedroom there was a toilet and

347
00:23:32.741 --> 00:23:37.360
you wa made Brown.
And I thought to myself,
Gosh,
I can hear everything.

348
00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:39.700
That was bad.
Why isn't he closing the door?
I didn't

349
00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.000
<v 4>realize this was such a nice,</v>

350
00:23:41.001 --> 00:23:44.260
so what happened was we went to this hotel and in the hotel

351
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.950
there was,
they gave us an upgrade.
So you know,

352
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.420
I paid for a room and we got there and I think because we were,

353
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.910
were doing like this makeup date,
right,

354
00:23:55.911 --> 00:24:00.911
of like our celebration in a nursery that the people who arranged it knew that.

355
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:02.270
And they,
when we got there,

356
00:24:02.271 --> 00:24:06.230
they were like basically a room is available that no one is buying that day.

357
00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:09.740
So they go,
we're going to upgrade you and there's a much better route.
Sure.

358
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:15.050
And it had um,
you know,
from the bedroom to the shower,

359
00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:16.281
like in the,

360
00:24:16.281 --> 00:24:20.240
in order to the bathroom in the bathroom you could shut a door in the bathroom,

361
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:24.980
but there was also doors that separate the bathroom itself from the bedroom.

362
00:24:24.981 --> 00:24:26.180
I didn't shut that door.

363
00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:31.080
<v 0>Right.
And it was,
it was cool because I got to hear like,
you know when you,
um,</v>

364
00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.750
you know someone's on the toilet,

365
00:24:32.751 --> 00:24:36.730
like the toilet farts then like a regular farm cause it's this,

366
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:41.060
the acoustics are different and it comes out fast.
No,
yours are like

367
00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:44.920
pretty like sputtering,
like you know,

368
00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:49.990
soft serve ice cream when it runs out at the end,
pop,

369
00:24:49.991 --> 00:24:54.750
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
like um,
like a carburetor trying to turn over.
Yeah,

370
00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.313
yeah,
yeah.

371
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:57.703
<v 10>I</v>

372
00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:04.940
<v 0>yeah.
And I was like close the door and I yelled at to you,
close the door.</v>

373
00:25:04.941 --> 00:25:09.350
I want to hear you,
but I forgot how sick your,
your doot doot sound.

374
00:25:09.351 --> 00:25:12.200
They don't sound healthy at all.
It was fine.
Everything was,

375
00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:14.120
that's normal early fine.
Yeah.

376
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:18.620
Well you went to the doctor and you had your prostate exam.

377
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:23.550
<v 4>Um,
I did.
Um,
uh,
I will,
uh,
tell you all about it here.</v>

378
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.500
Okay.
Oh Man,
I don't know if you know this or not,

379
00:25:28.501 --> 00:25:33.380
but um,
but we have new bills to pay and each will be right back.

380
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:37.640
Yeah.
So I went back to the business.

381
00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.740
I went to get a physical first time in a year and a half,

382
00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:45.840
cause I want a little longer than I should have.
And [inaudible] first of all,

383
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:47.063
I,
uh,

384
00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:52.020
I'm not going to give you the number is I'm a very ashamed of my body,

385
00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:53.000
but,
um,

386
00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:58.310
I only weigh five pounds more than I did when I first saw my doctor,

387
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:05.100
uh,
12 years ago.
Are you kidding me?
Yeah.
Congratulations.
Sorry to go.

388
00:26:05.101 --> 00:26:08.160
We went through the weights and he was like,
oh my God,
cause it's great.

389
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:12.150
It was like,
let's see,
2008 UAA.
Then 2009 2010 to the end.
He started for,

390
00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:16.510
and he was like 2014 he was like,
oh my God.
Wow.
That was,

391
00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.800
that was a tough year.
Way Up there.
Then I did,

392
00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:23.880
I didn't even see him the next year.
Yeah,
the baby at 2015 no,

393
00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:26.400
because I was so out of shape was,

394
00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.090
I remember they call it and like you wanna do a physical.
I was like,
ah,

395
00:26:29.091 --> 00:26:32.730
I'm on the road and then I,
I wouldn't go see him.
I didn't want to,

396
00:26:32.731 --> 00:26:36.660
I knew that if I went to see him,
he'd be like,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Well,

397
00:26:36.661 --> 00:26:38.880
we gained a lot of weight with my first pregnancy.

398
00:26:38.881 --> 00:26:42.450
You and I would go eat breakfast and then get dessert with breakfast every time.

399
00:26:42.451 --> 00:26:47.310
Every time.
Every day.
Yeah.
It's crazy.
It was fun.
I really liked being really fat.

400
00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.710
I am still fat,

401
00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:53.220
but I like the just throwing it all away,

402
00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:58.360
being really fat when you just go like,
fuck it,
we're going to go full truck.

403
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:02.160
I'm not a model.
That's the best part about being a comedian.

404
00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.810
And then everyone,
everyone's such a piece of shit that they're like,

405
00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:08.370
I love when you're fat.

406
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:13.860
They still tell me now I liked you more fat.
And I'm like,
God damn.

407
00:27:13.861 --> 00:27:18.861
What a cool thing to say to somebody for you to be no terrible cause you stay

408
00:27:19.681 --> 00:27:23.790
fat so that we find you funny.
So they took all this blood,

409
00:27:23.791 --> 00:27:27.120
of course p texted to check all your berm.
Yeah,

410
00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:30.610
they ran an EKG and then he's like,
all right,
it's time to do the uh,

411
00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:32.880
old a prostate exam,

412
00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:36.880
check your oil because finger all the way into mine.

413
00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:42.840
And Man,
this was different.
It's my second time.

414
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:47.610
The first time he did it,
he did what I actually ended up staying in my special,

415
00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:52.320
which is,
he was like,
no,
this is my cock.
I mean my finger.

416
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:57.690
But it was like,
honestly kind of gentle and it really wasn't,

417
00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:02.190
I mean it was quick and uncover,
you know,
this time he's like,
I'm getting lube.

418
00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.050
And I was like,
okay.
And I'm facing the wall.

419
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.620
And then he went immediately all the weight without a warning.

420
00:28:07.621 --> 00:28:12.530
Just all the way in and dug around and I was like,
ah.
And he,

421
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:16.170
he can't,
I go,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
And he's like,
come on Doug.

422
00:28:16.171 --> 00:28:20.590
It around like really fingered me really hard.
Then he scooped it out.
Yeah,

423
00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.330
he goes,
me,
see if there's any blood in your shit.
And I was like,
okay.

424
00:28:24.331 --> 00:28:26.940
And I'm sitting there looking at the wall like,
what the fuck just happened?

425
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:30.870
And I'm like,
dude,
you're really not chill with fingering.

426
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:34.440
Like if you finger girls the way you figured my ass.
And he's like,

427
00:28:34.441 --> 00:28:38.550
that's not how I finger girls.
And then he just,
he just goes,

428
00:28:38.551 --> 00:28:42.420
there's tissues next to you,
clean your ass.
And he walked out.
Yeah.

429
00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:46.220
Fuck our tissues.
And then did you wipe brand?
I had to wipe.
Yeah.
And there was,

430
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:50.430
there was jelly and Brown all over.
Horrible,
horrible.

431
00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:54.900
And I felt like really sore.
Yeah,
of course.
And I just kept thinking about Terry.

432
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.870
I kept thinking about Terry talking about,

433
00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:02.760
you know how that toy had a big head on it.
Yeah.
That was also like,
man,

434
00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:04.330
how do people put Dixon their butts?

435
00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:09.450
It kind of gives me joy that you suffered in a doctor.
Thank you so much.

436
00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:13.500
You know not to,
but we do that shit every year.

437
00:29:13.501 --> 00:29:16.530
You get a fucking finger in your butt,
you get stuff up your cooch.

438
00:29:16.531 --> 00:29:20.610
I've had two babies and you,
all you do is stand there and watch.
It's true.

439
00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.970
And I've had my stuff.
Yeah,
it wasn't,

440
00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:27.980
it's just nice to know that you're finally getting your button.
Yeah,
yeah.
Thanks.

441
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:31.710
No,
it was very uncomfortable.
And then he called me today.
He was like,

442
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:35.520
oh guess what?
Um,
everything came back great.
And uh,

443
00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:37.780
I've never been on cholesterol medication guys.

444
00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:40.980
Like your cholesterol is down just from the lifestyle.
So that's great.

445
00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:43.590
Just eating all the Mcdonald's for that week.
He's like,

446
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.890
I have to eat at Mcdonald's.
And I was like,
no,
not anymore.
So yeah,

447
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.510
that was great.
Cool.
So,
uh,
well good.
So you're healthy,

448
00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:55.650
I mean healthy somewhat.
Sure.
Yeah.

449
00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:59.650
I mean I'm healthy enough to probably get through the year.
She is tight.

450
00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:04.990
I don't know.
We got two kids,
man.
I know.
I'm going to try to live two kids,

451
00:30:04.991 --> 00:30:07.780
two dogs,
big life.
Speaking of dogs,

452
00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.710
we're having a cocktail,
you sugar,
the physical.

453
00:30:11.711 --> 00:30:14.920
We were having this conversation because we,
um,
you know,

454
00:30:14.921 --> 00:30:18.220
we've had these dogs now for years and,
and we love our dogs,

455
00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:19.210
but there's this thing

456
00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:24.490
because I post pictures of them on the gram and people are like,

457
00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:26.590
they mistaken bitsy for Fifo.

458
00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:30.820
Pretty stupid that this guy's the array.

459
00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:35.390
You're wearing an Oji FIFO shirt,
Theo,

460
00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:36.580
it was his original name.

461
00:30:36.581 --> 00:30:41.581
And then 20 folks is the best guess on the aim black.

462
00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.520
Yeah.
Well,
Betsy is,
uh,

463
00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:49.620
is the pure breed pure bred dog and a fief is the rescue from the hood.

464
00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:54.670
And anyway,
there's this thing that happens when people start telling you this,

465
00:30:54.671 --> 00:30:57.040
when you're about to have a kid,
if you have a dog,
they're like,
oh,

466
00:30:57.041 --> 00:30:59.610
that poor dog you,
you know,

467
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.410
he doesn't know that he's about to get a lot less attention.
And you're like,

468
00:31:02.411 --> 00:31:05.890
that's inconceivable because the dog is your world.
If you're like,

469
00:31:05.891 --> 00:31:09.100
if you're a couple and that's your dog,
you know,
and man,

470
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:14.700
they're right.
They're totally right.
Like he was,
art happens,

471
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:18.940
he was 24 seven because what happens is you have all that love and attention.

472
00:31:18.941 --> 00:31:23.470
You're putting it on this,
this animal that you legitimately adore.

473
00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.040
But when you have children,
it's not that you go like fuck this dog,

474
00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:29.830
it's that you then not only do you want to,

475
00:31:29.831 --> 00:31:34.831
but you have to put so much energy into the human baby that you just have.

476
00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:38.080
You start to have a little less time.
Right?

477
00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.600
Can't like manage every moment.

478
00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:44.470
I'm poor fif like I try to make time for faith and bits throughout the day.

479
00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.980
They sleep with us at night and we give them nighttime as that's what it looks

480
00:31:48.981 --> 00:31:52.150
like the end of the day they come onto the bed,
we watch our shows,

481
00:31:52.151 --> 00:31:55.780
they lay on us,
but it does feel like less.

482
00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:59.890
And I feel guilty and Fefe has also now,
you know with dogs he's,

483
00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.320
he's now like kind of an older guy,
right?

484
00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:04.900
He's a little bit of an old meds and stuff.

485
00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:10.050
And one of the great thrills of that dog is seen like when you open the backyard

486
00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:13.960
door to let him out and he sees a squirrel,

487
00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:19.600
a bunny now,
or sometimes a mouse or something or rat,
right?

488
00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:23.650
Like you'll see and the dogs are writers,
they're bred to,

489
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:26.240
they were bred to be wrapped from Belgium and they're meant to,

490
00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:29.710
to find rats inside of barns.
You see the DNA,

491
00:32:29.711 --> 00:32:33.400
you see the instincts take over and so cool his eyes,
she'll kill,

492
00:32:33.401 --> 00:32:35.770
kill bug out and hair stands up.
And he's like,
oh.

493
00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.680
And then he's just charged up for a while.
He's like walking around like,

494
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:43.490
you know,
you just fired up.
He's an older guy now.

495
00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:49.230
<v 5>Of course,
he's never actually gotten any of those animals.
Right.
But it's just,</v>

496
00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:53.460
there's a thrill thing.
So we were thinking that it'd be pretty cool.

497
00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:58.020
Um,
just to get like,
just to get them a win.
You know,
sometimes you're like,

498
00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:02.940
this guy needs a win that we would go and get,

499
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.650
uh,
a rabbit,
maybe from a,
a breeder or like,

500
00:33:07.651 --> 00:33:11.190
I don't know if they do rescue rabbits or something.
And,
uh,

501
00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:14.970
basically make it slow,

502
00:33:14.971 --> 00:33:17.880
like break one of his shakes and then

503
00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.800
<v 4>let fif catch him,
you know,</v>

504
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:25.960
so I can get the thing for exactly.
So,
you know,
you go and you're like,

505
00:33:25.961 --> 00:33:30.520
I want to rescue a button.
And they're like,
ah,
I'm great.
Yeah,

506
00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:34.780
we go to a rescue.
And they're like,
oh,
you guys are such good people.

507
00:33:34.781 --> 00:33:38.880
You're rescuing this rabbit.
Nobody wants him and be like,

508
00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:43.270
just so you know,
for its diet.
And we're like,
yeah,
no,
I got it.
And they're like,

509
00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:47.590
well,
it's pretty specific,
like,
man,
did you?
Yeah.
And then like in the car,

510
00:33:47.591 --> 00:33:51.260
we take it out to the car and I take a hammer and I break both of his legs.

511
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:57.700
We go to the backyard and we just put it in the backyard and it's like,

512
00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:01.030
I dunno what it,
and they're like,
go.
And then he was like,

513
00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:05.340
I got this mother fucker.
And he just,
I don't know,
strangles it or something.

514
00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.450
A rag doll.
He just,
yeah,
I could kill it like shark week did.
Yeah,

515
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:10.930
you take a bunny,
you know,
you throw it against the wall.

516
00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.630
Kind of just shock it and then that feeds go.

517
00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:17.920
But my favorite part is when the person at the shelter is like,

518
00:34:17.921 --> 00:34:22.140
you guys are the best people.
Nobody wants these rabbits on.
Yeah,
I know.

519
00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:25.780
And then they do the followup visits.
Like they were like,
oh,

520
00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:30.940
see how nibbles is doing?
And we're like,
well we had a problem.
What'd you do?

521
00:34:30.941 --> 00:34:34.900
What happened?
I accidentally stomped on both of his legs,

522
00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:39.610
but you wouldn't have to do that to their rescue bunny because in my mind,

523
00:34:39.611 --> 00:34:41.410
these are two different scenarios.

524
00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:44.230
The rescue rabbit's probably going to be fucked up already.

525
00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:48.970
Is it like it might be like bread or bread or bread,
you know what I mean?

526
00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.780
It might have,
it might be like a rescue from like the cosmetics industry.

527
00:34:52.781 --> 00:34:56.980
So it's eyes are blind.
We should rescue behind one of line.

528
00:34:56.981 --> 00:34:58.780
Rabbit doesn't know what the hell is going on.

529
00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:03.720
What we need is we need a rabbit in a confined space.
Yeah.

530
00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:06.180
It's a thing there so fast.
I watched them chase there

531
00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:09.580
<v 5>fucking fast,
but we need a,
we need to capture a rabbit.</v>

532
00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:13.260
Put in more like a little room and then put fifa.

533
00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:18.710
<v 4>How do we slow the squirrel down?</v>

534
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:23.360
We could shoot a squirrel with a BB gun so that it's just slow down.

535
00:35:23.361 --> 00:35:27.590
Slow down.
That's a really good idea.
Are you a good shot?

536
00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:29.790
<v 5>I'm decent.
Yeah.</v>

537
00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:32.480
<v 4>Maybe that's what we do is just shoot score.
I want to make it make it</v>

538
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.080
<v 5>clear.</v>

539
00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:37.800
I am not in favor of hurting any animals unless it leads to my dog getting,

540
00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:43.710
<v 4>okay,
don't send me this shit about don't hurt animals.
I know that.
I love my,</v>

541
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:45.720
but it's for our dog is entertainment.

542
00:35:45.721 --> 00:35:48.480
We love our dog and it's a give him a boost.
He's a Co,
you know what it is.

543
00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:52.770
It's like an old guy getting some Viagra.
You don't.
When the old guy pops,

544
00:35:52.771 --> 00:35:56.400
have I ever,
he's like,
this thing gets hard again and he's got a little swag.

545
00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:59.850
That's all I want for my dog.
It's like when I'm old,

546
00:35:59.851 --> 00:36:04.520
George Bush was like grabbing asses.
He was in the wheelchair and kind of old and

547
00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:11.970
that was his joke.
A bad joke was a,
you know,
my favorite magician is,

548
00:36:11.971 --> 00:36:16.650
and they're like,
no,
what?
Who?
He was like David Copperfield.
Yeah,

549
00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:19.990
I believe you.
This is 100% true.
Oh,

550
00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:24.340
I like that photo op.
It was during photo ops and he'd be like,
he was like,

551
00:36:24.341 --> 00:36:26.100
come lean down.

552
00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:31.080
And then they would me know and then I'd be like,

553
00:36:31.081 --> 00:36:34.870
here's a cute lady in a dress.
And he's like,
DM low.

554
00:36:34.871 --> 00:36:36.110
My favorite

555
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:42.650
David Copperfield.
Whoa.
Yeah,
I like that.
You know,
I,

556
00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:43.710
we talked about it like I got,

557
00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:48.540
I thought it was such bullshit that the people would be like,

558
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:52.270
I was so hurt and affect me.
Yeah.

559
00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:57.840
He's old as shit.
A 90 year old guy grabs your ass and you're like,
Nah,

560
00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:02.410
I didn't know.
He's fucking old.
Didn't even know what's going on.

561
00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:06.560
What's going on it four teeth left in his mouth.
He just,

562
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.470
just fucking,

563
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:09.660
I don't know what you just put your titties in his face for a second.

564
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.540
I don't know if I do all that,
but it's like an old ass guy,

565
00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.870
like the tip of his Dick.
Just squeeze the tip.

566
00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:19.860
You squeeze his tip.
I'm going to come in my hand.
Oh Babe.

567
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:22.570
I'm just like fucking base that comes out of it.

568
00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:26.610
Have you ever worked in an old folks home?
Oh yeah.
I like six,
seven years.

569
00:37:26.611 --> 00:37:28.880
I worked in her office.
No,
of course not.
Well,

570
00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:32.870
in high school I had to do Christian service hours and we had to deal with old

571
00:37:32.871 --> 00:37:33.240
people.

572
00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:38.160
Let me tell you if they've got the energy and the Moxie to do what you just
said,

573
00:37:38.161 --> 00:37:42.570
that whole set up punch thing,
Amy and a magician and I'd be like,
dude,

574
00:37:42.571 --> 00:37:43.171
good for you.

575
00:37:43.171 --> 00:37:47.370
Like at least you have the energy and the will to live enough to do that.

576
00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:50.610
I'd give it to them.
We let them have,

577
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:53.100
because most of them are just laying in their own pissed at that stage.

578
00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:58.080
They're not an old trail.
They fuck a lot when they,
when they can get around.

579
00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:03.110
That's what I hear that the male old folks homes have a lot of STDs said.

580
00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:08.280
I like your dad.
No folks homes,

581
00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:12.000
we have a lot of sexually transmitted diseases.

582
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:16.560
What's the word?
I can't say the r word anymore.

583
00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:21.060
The mentally challenged people,
what do they call?
Can't say that.

584
00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:25.110
I can't say the r word.
A fucking column now.
Blue.
Bam.

585
00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:29.810
You're a millennial.
Mentally challenged.
Mentally challenged.

586
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:35.560
They get around to sure.
I've heard they like to fuck.
Okay,

587
00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:40.540
that's true.
Do you know speaking of that word we have?
Um,
no,

588
00:38:40.541 --> 00:38:44.150
don't,
don't dismiss it as a true,
they're very random.
I know,
but we have built,

589
00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:47.530
this is pretty amazing.
We have somebody,
I think she's a,

590
00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:51.810
she's teaching English as a second language.
Yeah.
Yeah.

591
00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:56.120
I don't think you've seen this.
This lady is teaching this and theirs is,

592
00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:01.360
is it on Youtube?
Like she puts this up out.
How does that work?
Yeah,

593
00:39:01.361 --> 00:39:05.020
this is a popular youtube channel that's trying to teach English as a second

594
00:39:05.021 --> 00:39:09.670
language.
Okay.
And uh,
just a heads up all the comments on this or like,

595
00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:14.470
oh,
they're not really great at English.
Like,
oh,
their workings of the language.

596
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.440
That's pretty funny.
Yeah.
So,
and this is one of the main,

597
00:39:17.441 --> 00:39:19.780
I guess teachers have it here.
This lady,
I think she's one of them.

598
00:39:19.781 --> 00:39:22.360
She's one of them.
Yeah.
Let's,
let's see what she says about English.

599
00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:23.973
It's pretty good.

600
00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:29.440
<v 11>Have you spoken to someone over the phone?
Oh my God,</v>

601
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:33.960
this person is so unprofessional or so uninter rested to,

602
00:39:33.961 --> 00:39:38.170
I'm going to help you with a couple of ways that would help you to talk right

603
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:39.100
over the phone.

604
00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:44.280
So the first drink that I have for you is mentioned your name when you answer

605
00:39:44.281 --> 00:39:47.450
the call and also make sure you have a nice happy,

606
00:39:47.451 --> 00:39:49.880
friendly tone when you answer the call.

607
00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:52.970
<v 4>Okay.
That's pretty good.
So far,
so good</v>

608
00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:56.110
<v 11>trick that I have for you is speak clearly.</v>

609
00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:00.700
God is important for you to pronounce your words well.
Yeah,
of course.

610
00:40:00.701 --> 00:40:05.701
Please do a wide mumbling or talking too fast or gushing.

611
00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:09.760
This would not help the color to understand what you was saying.

612
00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:14.060
<v 4>Yeah,
but that's doesn't mean gushing,
gushing like,
oh no.
Yeah,</v>

613
00:40:14.061 --> 00:40:16.460
you can see that minister using,
oh,
okay.

614
00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:20.480
She is when you're like overly complimentary.
Right.
But I mean,
you know,

615
00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:22.760
she's saying she's still on point with what you heard.

616
00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:27.380
<v 11>So first one that I have for you is use your words,
right?</v>

617
00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:32.660
It doesn't make sense if you are talking to your boss or if you were talking to

618
00:40:32.661 --> 00:40:37.661
your grandmother and you use the team language or you use slangs like you would

619
00:40:37.971 --> 00:40:42.260
go,
Hey,
what's up?
So are you having fun?
Are Hardcore Fun.

620
00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:46.430
Your boss or your grand mom would think you are completely retarded.

621
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:51.500
So use your words right.
That fits the listener.
Tom

622
00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:53.210
<v 4>is crazy.</v>

623
00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:54.443
<v 0>Are you?</v>

624
00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:02.890
So are you having hardcore fun,
hardcore,
fun,
hardcore?

625
00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:06.660
I cannot believe she said that.
She said the ROR she did.

626
00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:09.900
That's terrible.
That's not hardcore fund at all.
You know,

627
00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:12.180
supposed to do are completely retarded.

628
00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:15.210
Oh my God.

629
00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:20.990
<v 4>Yeah,
that is not okay.
That is not okay.</v>

630
00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:26.090
That is not okay.
Um,
offended.
Are you upset?
I'm very upset.

631
00:41:26.091 --> 00:41:30.590
You can't tell that I'm upset right now.
I'm very,
very,
I'm very upset.
Right?

632
00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:32.520
<v 11>Do you are completely retarded.</v>

633
00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:34.000
<v 0>We're retarded.</v>

634
00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:39.320
Are you having fun that somebody produces?

635
00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:43.950
<v 4>I learn language,
video and like put that out there.</v>

636
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:49.080
Is that old or is it like recent?
Uh,
that I'm not sure.

637
00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:50.653
You don't know?

638
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.130
<v 0>I'm more concerned about how</v>

639
00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:59.880
you're going to have hardcore fun.
Like that's a phrase,
at least the r word,

640
00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:04.530
but hardcore funds,
not even a,
Hey,
what's up?
Are you having hardcore fun

641
00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:09.420
<v 12>fuck her in the head one day down here beside the garage.
The door.</v>

642
00:42:09.421 --> 00:42:10.750
She called me out or retarded.

643
00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.630
How's going knock her in the head with a Claw Hammer?

644
00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:16.070
<v 0>It will knock on to here with a Claw Hammer.
Yeah,
that's,
that's pretty intense.</v>

645
00:42:16.071 --> 00:42:19.420
A heated debate in that your mom's house history is,

646
00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:23.450
is it are worded or just our word and I want to say the word.

647
00:42:23.451 --> 00:42:27.320
I'll get in trouble.
You should never say it.
You can say our word.

648
00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:30.920
You can't say the real word right?
You can't,
you can't say it.

649
00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:40.110
<v 4>Uh,
man.
Um,
all right.
Let's,
um,

Right.</v>

650
00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.600
Let's get,
or we can do that.
We can do it between them,
right.

651
00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:46.410
We're going to do him between the dark web site.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

652
00:42:46.411 --> 00:42:50.330
We'll do them between,
okay.
Okay.
Unless you want to do it now.
I know.

653
00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:53.190
What do you think we can,
we can choose.
We can pick and choose

654
00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:57.550
<v 0>sub she gene,

Once you get in there.
Okay,</v>

655
00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:02.850

Yeah.
Are you?
Hello?
How are you?

656
00:43:02.851 --> 00:43:07.020
Are you having a hardcore fun?
I'm having hardcore,

657
00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:11.270
<v 4>core hard fucking court by let's do it near.</v>

658
00:43:11.271 --> 00:43:16.000
Is Josh Potter coming in?
All right.
It is that time again.

659
00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:20.600
One of our dear friends,
great comedian,
uh,

660
00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:25.650
excellent producer is joining us for another segment of his jock hotter every

661
00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:28.300
year.

662
00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:32.510
<v 0>Alright.
Josh spotters here.
See I did that right then.</v>

663
00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:36.210
<v 4>Just bulled.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
It doesn't play.
Nah,
just happens.</v>

664
00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:43.020
<v 0>Close to play.
I know.
I'm coming</v>

665
00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:50.230
<v 4>dude.
Um,
outside of COBB's in San Francisco,
when we were there,</v>

666
00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:52.030
there was a woman crying like that.

667
00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:54.130
Very sounded just like that just from seeing you.

668
00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:56.680
I guess she was outside the show after my set.

669
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:58.240
You were on stage and she was just like,

670
00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.710
and I was like going to approach her to see what was going on,

671
00:44:02.711 --> 00:44:06.330
but then some other dip shit came up and was like,
we've got a goal.
And like,

672
00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:10.030
and they were in the show you think?
Yeah,
they were wasted.
Uh,
she got kicked out.

673
00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:12.260
I think that's what happened.
That's probably best.
Yeah.

674
00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:15.880
I love when a drunk person gets kicked out so well deserved.

675
00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:19.560
And then they write to you and they're like,
I'm sorry,
go,
go,
go.

676
00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:24.070
Can I get tickets to the next day?
Come back and do that again.

677
00:44:24.071 --> 00:44:27.370
So great.
Um,
I'll mention it again,
but before I forget,

678
00:44:27.371 --> 00:44:32.371
I'm very excited to announce a lot of people listen to this show the show love

679
00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:37.470
<v 5>you Josh Potter and you are going to be doing a show,</v>

680
00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.700
I believe that's Friday.
Friday,
is that correct?
Assert Friday,

681
00:44:41.701 --> 00:44:45.510
March 22nd at the Improv lab.

682
00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:50.310
I'll tickets are on sale now.
We will post that link everywhere.

683
00:44:50.311 --> 00:44:53.850
You'll post it on your Twitter.
I'll post it on mine.
You posted on yours.

684
00:44:53.851 --> 00:44:58.290
But listen to me.
There's a reason I brought this guy all over the country,

685
00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:03.150
so he's hilarious.
Go to the show.
If you're la based,
it's a Friday night.

686
00:45:03.151 --> 00:45:05.400
It'd be a fun time.
You're going to do a long set.

687
00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:10.350
<v 13>Yeah,
I'm pumped for it,
dude.
I'm excited to come.
I'll get faded with some hard.</v>

688
00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:14.970
You always have good stuff for us.
Josh,
what's your,
what's your,

689
00:45:14.971 --> 00:45:19.560
what are you going to show us today?
Well,
uh,
we all know scumbags in comedy.

690
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:21.690
Yes.
We've brought them up plenty of times.
Yeah.

691
00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:27.120
I spent my early life living in the lowest rung of show business,

692
00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:31.590
which is broadcast radio,
which is unnecessarily comedy.

693
00:45:31.591 --> 00:45:35.250
Can look down on radio.
Yeah,
exactly.
Only legs,

694
00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:38.830
like segment of entertainment that we can be like,
oh,
fucking radio guys.
Yeah.

695
00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:43.240
And here in Hollywood we know of scumbags in every realm of entertainment.
Yes.

696
00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:47.910
But I don't think enough people realize the scumbag baggery that occurs in

697
00:45:47.911 --> 00:45:50.700
broadcast ratings.
Do you think that is Josh?

698
00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:54.200
Because it's the lowest rung of show business.
It takes an animal to,

699
00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:57.660
to thrive in that environment and animal to thrive.
Meaning,

700
00:45:57.661 --> 00:46:01.800
like what the moving around the,
Oh,
the,
the uh,
you know,

701
00:46:01.801 --> 00:46:05.480
not knowing your future,
moving around,
uh,

702
00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:09.840
just the nature of doing a morning zoo show.
Yeah.

703
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:12.720
It's gotta be tough.
Ultimate scum baggery occurs there.

704
00:46:12.721 --> 00:46:16.290
Now I want to preface this by saying the guys I work with primarily in my
career.

705
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.750
Super Cool.
Super Nice,
right?

706
00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.440
Everybody was talented and they evolved with time.

707
00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:24.390
Not like so many others.

708
00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:30.060
<v 5>No.
Before you get into this,
how,
just how experienced you are and radio.
Oh yeah.</v>

709
00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:32.580
And you,
you worked in radio for a dozen years.

710
00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:37.590
<v 13>Since I was 16.
Until now or until last year,
basically till I was 30.</v>

711
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:41.460
And I work primarily with and Reagan and buffalo who are getting super great.

712
00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:44.790
But there was a moment where I thought I was going to elevate my career and I

713
00:46:44.791 --> 00:46:47.810
moved to Cleveland and uh hmm.

714
00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:52.530
I worked on a morning show there with some psychopaths.
In fact,

715
00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:56.830
the first gentleman that I bring up in my scumbags radio,
uh,

716
00:46:56.910 --> 00:47:00.060
is actually the guy that I chose to replace me.

717
00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:04.020
And this is his mug shot up on the screen.
If it's going to take a look.

718
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:06.020
He chose to replace you?
Yes.

719
00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:10.090
I resigned from my position because I couldn't work with these psychopaths and

720
00:47:10.091 --> 00:47:13.290
uh,
went back to buffalo and they were like,
who do you think should replace you?

721
00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.470
And I was like,
this guy looks good.
And uh,
oh,

722
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.760
this his name is Jay Spooner.
Wait,
why is he shirtless and his mugshot?

723
00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:24.700
Is that a,
well,
there's a few theories on that.
Uh,

724
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:28.170
there's some people that speculate that he was just arrested that way.

725
00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:30.370
That's a pretty good speculation.
Yeah,
I would say so.

726
00:47:30.371 --> 00:47:32.510
But others have then noted that,
uh,

727
00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:37.090
the municipality in which he was apprehended requires you to take your shirt off

728
00:47:37.091 --> 00:47:39.530
for the mugshot.
I don't know why they would do that.
Maybe again,

729
00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.430
it humiliation to get a peek at that sweet superman tech.

730
00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:46.660
Pretty Tattoos.
Yeah,
right.
Maybe.
Yeah.
Yeah.

731
00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:48.490
Just to judge your slobby shouldn't body,

732
00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:53.530
it could be added humiliation to the way that that a sheriff,
a Rainbow Guy,

733
00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:58.000
how you used to put people in pink chips.
I think they're like,

734
00:47:58.001 --> 00:48:00.250
you gotta take your shirt off.
It's required by law.

735
00:48:00.251 --> 00:48:02.500
And then they make you make you look like an idiot like this,

736
00:48:02.501 --> 00:48:04.820
but this scumbag Burt would do real well.
Okay.

737
00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:07.270
Well he wouldn't have even had a should go.
He goes,

738
00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:13.690
you request to take your shirt off at a mugshot.
But what this gentleman did?

739
00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:17.100
Yeah,
he used his profile on the radio,
uh,

740
00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:22.130
to help a friend from elementary school who has cystic fibrosis raise money for

741
00:48:22.681 --> 00:48:26.730
a go fund me.
He thought,
you know what?
I'm going to bring attention to this.

742
00:48:26.731 --> 00:48:28.710
Go Fund me page.
We'll raise a bunch of money.

743
00:48:28.711 --> 00:48:33.060
They did and then he funneled it all into his bank account.
Oh my God.

744
00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.670
Yeah.
Wow.
Real special move.
Yeah.

745
00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:37.800
How do you figure you're going to get away with that?
And you said what?

746
00:48:37.801 --> 00:48:41.560
That the school,
was it a what?
What type of school?
You said it starts with an e.

747
00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:47.010
I.
L.
A.
O.
And.
L.
He knew her since elementary school.
Oh,

748
00:48:47.011 --> 00:48:49.480
lemon LMO.
Yes.
Okay.
So is that,

749
00:48:49.481 --> 00:48:52.170
am I saying it differently than you guys know that?
That sounds right.

750
00:48:52.171 --> 00:48:56.060
Say it again.
How do you sell them in?
Hmm.
No,

751
00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.810
that's a different way of saying yes,
sure.

752
00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:03.090
You vote the played that the buffalo way of saying I don't believe so.

753
00:49:03.091 --> 00:49:06.000
I think that that's the queries,
the queen's English ELA men.

754
00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:12.220
Nobody says elementary or literally the first guy.
I never heard of that one.

755
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:18.430
That was able to complete sentences and pay for things that says I love men.

756
00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:24.930
Terry,
you hear it that way?
Who said that?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I never knew.

757
00:49:24.931 --> 00:49:29.700
I said it weird until just now.
And your parents aren't foreigners?

758
00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:32.580
Yeah,
they are.
My Dad is a complete for,
oh,
that's a foreign,

759
00:49:32.581 --> 00:49:36.060
it's elementary and elementary.
Elementary.
Yeah.
Joe.
Yeah.
Element.

760
00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:45.420
So,
well this is a real special dude.
Yeah.
So I mean,

761
00:49:45.421 --> 00:49:46.530
and then there's actual,
yeah,

762
00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:49.290
well you can go on youtube and find videos of him lying to people.

763
00:49:49.291 --> 00:49:53.140
Like he also scammed the guy who made his website for this charity.
Uh,

764
00:49:53.141 --> 00:49:56.040
he scammed some people out of a,

765
00:49:56.041 --> 00:50:01.041
he posted on craigslist a rental home that he did not own Wa and then accepted

766
00:50:01.081 --> 00:50:05.560
payments for it up to $8,000.
Wow.
What's Mild Shadow?
What he,

767
00:50:05.561 --> 00:50:07.800
is he in jail right now?
Uh,
he is,
as a matter of fact,

768
00:50:07.801 --> 00:50:12.801
she was sentenced to 30 months in jail because he also during the investigations

769
00:50:12.961 --> 00:50:15.630
for the first couple of scams,
yeah,
he uh,

770
00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:19.980
obviously got fired from the radio station and then a family friend brought him

771
00:50:19.981 --> 00:50:20.701
in and said,
you know what,

772
00:50:20.701 --> 00:50:23.310
work at my bar while you're trying to get back on your feet.

773
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:28.340
And while he was there he stole blank checks and then wrote out checks for

774
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:30.030
$6,000.
Yeah.

775
00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:35.390
I mean you gotta think in this day and age again hot like this stuff is so

776
00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:36.950
traceable and trackable.

777
00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:40.460
But it is like this fascinating thing you were saying though about the radio

778
00:50:40.461 --> 00:50:44.690
business.
Cause you do get to go like I am officially in show business,

779
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:49.100
you know what I mean?
Like you're,
you,
you stepped into and you have,

780
00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:53.270
you can work in pretty low radio and still like you run into,

781
00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:56.150
you mean celebrities come into your studio course,
right?
So it's like this,

782
00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:59.060
but you make no money.
That's crazy to me.

783
00:50:59.061 --> 00:51:02.420
No matter what you make pot poverty level of money.
So I can like,

784
00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:05.030
I can understand maybe this guy,
he had a kid,
you know,

785
00:51:05.031 --> 00:51:07.070
maybe he was just a really up against it.

786
00:51:07.071 --> 00:51:09.920
But also these radio folks have a lot of demons.

787
00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:12.140
A lot of them have gambling issues.

788
00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:16.610
A lot of them have a drinking and drug issues.
So,
uh,
he,

789
00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:20.090
I didn't know anything about those types of things with him when I met him.

790
00:51:20.091 --> 00:51:25.030
Right.
You get everything but the money in most,
oh my God,
you get access.
Yeah.

791
00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:26.980
Arable.
Yeah,
tons of access.

792
00:51:26.981 --> 00:51:30.740
You get backstage at the fucking Beyonce concert and you're just meeting,

793
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:31.500
you know,
you're

794
00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:35.030
<v 0>celebrity without money is the fucking,
it's still work.</v>

795
00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:39.840
Somebody who was on a reality show on the 90s it's the worst thing ever because

796
00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:43.050
people will yell at you on the streets and stuff like,
Hey Christina,

797
00:51:43.051 --> 00:51:44.660
are we stupid bitch road rules?

798
00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:47.700
And then you have no way to insulate yourself from p right.
No Way.

799
00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:49.230
And it's all sources

800
00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:54.540
<v 13>post to like glad hanged clients and people who are like advertisers and you</v>

801
00:51:55.421 --> 00:51:59.470
can't even compete with them in terms of social interaction because you have no

802
00:51:59.471 --> 00:52:03.100
money to like turn on terrain.
Told me of a radio guy.

803
00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:06.910
I don't think he's one of the people featured here who was like,
uh,
he had,

804
00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:10.750
he was in,
let's say he had played sports and he was like,

805
00:52:10.751 --> 00:52:13.750
I'm not paying for anything at this.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
Our end.
Like,

806
00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:16.600
like it was just that thing.
He was like,
I'm not like,
they,

807
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:18.430
they should just comp it.
Yeah.
And then they did.

808
00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:19.990
And a lot of people operate on that level,

809
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:23.980
especially former athletes in the broadcast around because they're so used to

810
00:52:23.981 --> 00:52:28.210
being,
uh,
you know,
taking care of all the way along.

811
00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:32.590
And then they start working in radio and people kind of slight them a little bit

812
00:52:32.591 --> 00:52:36.380
cause down there and radio.
Right.
But then they're like,
I'm still a shit.
Yeah.

813
00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:41.830
And they get their way a lot of times.
And a lot of times,
not just athletes,

814
00:52:41.831 --> 00:52:42.850
but radio guys.

815
00:52:43.330 --> 00:52:48.310
I remember talking to a few that all drove free vehicles because they spot an

816
00:52:48.311 --> 00:52:49.270
endorsement.
You got you,

817
00:52:49.271 --> 00:52:53.740
you try to supplement your income with endorsements and appearances and things

818
00:52:53.741 --> 00:52:57.550
like that.
Kinda think it's so unnatural to set your alarm to wake up.

819
00:52:57.551 --> 00:53:02.170
At what time did you wake up?
Three 30 in the morning or five in Cleveland.

820
00:53:02.171 --> 00:53:03.620
I woke up at three.
That's what I'm,

821
00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:05.100
<v 0>and so it's three in the morning.</v>

822
00:53:05.101 --> 00:53:10.040
Everybody is still dark and then you're expected to be like,
hey everybody
normal.

823
00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:10.490
<v 13>No,</v>

824
00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:14.740
the whole thing is so unnatural and like some of those does morning shows to oh

825
00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:18.150
my fuck no.
All right.
You can deal with it.
I don't.
Uh,
I,

826
00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:21.080
I worked for a very good one,
so I understand.

827
00:53:21.081 --> 00:53:23.870
I've seen the others and then you understand the laziness.

828
00:53:23.871 --> 00:53:27.180
I understand as a comic not going in there and not being excited about it.

829
00:53:27.181 --> 00:53:29.880
That's for sure.
You know,
the other thing that,
that,
that change w with like,

830
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:32.130
even though the truth is there's,

831
00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:35.340
there's a narrative among some podcasts is that they're like,

832
00:53:35.341 --> 00:53:37.170
radio is dead and podcasting is that,

833
00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:39.510
and it's cool that podcasting has grown so much.

834
00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:44.800
Radio is still definitely something that more Americans listened to without a

835
00:53:45.301 --> 00:53:48.720
doubt.
I've seen the statistics on it,
but there was no money being,

836
00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:50.370
there's no content.

837
00:53:50.490 --> 00:53:55.490
And the truth is in some markets it is a total waste of time to do as promotion

838
00:53:56.311 --> 00:53:59.640
for your show.
But like the club will have a history with them,

839
00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:00.151
you know what I mean?

840
00:54:00.151 --> 00:54:05.151
So that we like come do this show and you can go on the show for two fucking

841
00:54:05.731 --> 00:54:09.090
hours and kill and you're like,
so what happened to the phone lines?

842
00:54:09.091 --> 00:54:13.950
Are they blow up?
Like,
did I sell a bunch of tickets?
No,
nothing happened.
Why?

843
00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:17.380
Well,
no,
because no one listens to that fucking show here.
I literally,

844
00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:20.910
I have wanted to go on those radio shows where no one's listening and be like,

845
00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:24.450
ah,
if anybody shows up to my show tonight at this club,
I will personally,

846
00:54:24.451 --> 00:54:28.230
I'll give you a blow job if you tell me you heard me on this shot.
Wow.
Yeah.

847
00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:33.200
It's never happened now.
Yeah,
man,
the Fargo North Dakota has missing out.
Yeah,

848
00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:35.940
I have this next gentleman.
Okay.

849
00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:39.360
Maybe he did his show down back in the day.
Although,
I mean,

850
00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:43.190
<v 7>I just really like to suck.
Cock actually big black coffee.</v>

851
00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:47.640
<v 13>Hmm.
Okay.
Well it kind of transitions well into this next gentleman.</v>

852
00:54:47.641 --> 00:54:50.930
The grease man.
This guy was in where he was in Washington DC.

853
00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:55.380
That's where he was most notable.
Stern.
You still read really back in the day.

854
00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:59.690
He's still works.
Believe it or not.
We'll get into that in a little bit,
but,
um,

855
00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:03.990
I'm gonna let first,
I want you to hear what this type of show this guy does.

856
00:55:03.991 --> 00:55:07.980
Let's listen to some of his humor.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.
Check it out.
Let's,

857
00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:12.630
let's try this out.
Try it out.
Mr Grease,
man,

858
00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:17.150
<v 7>you said you,
you're listening to the grease man on DC one on one.</v>

859
00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:22.390
<v 14>Oh,
you know what I'm getting here?
No,
no,
we're getting complaints.
I'm sorry.</v>

860
00:55:22.391 --> 00:55:24.790
I'm going to stop talking about it anytime now,
but I can't have it.

861
00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:27.520
I got there.

862
00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:31.533
I mean,

863
00:55:39.730 --> 00:55:42.470
I like makes me more raw.

864
00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:47.010
<v 13>Yeah,
no,
I got it.
This is like the guy that's like,</v>

865
00:55:47.011 --> 00:55:50.290
I want a woman drag me to the pain clinic.
Yeah.
It's similar,
right?

866
00:55:50.370 --> 00:55:51.810
It's very similar.
He's making,

867
00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:55.680
he's making a pleat all the ugly women in his listening audience that he is a

868
00:55:55.681 --> 00:55:58.200
dumpster diver and he is ready to just get down with it.

869
00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:04.380
That's the type of humor you get with it,
man.
Yeah.
Yeah.

870
00:56:04.381 --> 00:56:06.840
And he had that.
He did make a lot of weird noises and he'd be like,

871
00:56:06.841 --> 00:56:10.410
new grease man.
Why don't doodle and they make things like that.
Uh,

872
00:56:10.411 --> 00:56:15.010
but let's listen to some of his,
uh,
humor that he got in trouble for.
Oh,
okay.

873
00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:19.440
<v 7>A talk show host Joe Madison and his listeners spent the evening talking about</v>

874
00:56:19.441 --> 00:56:23.470
the grease man and the comment the country is now talking about Wednesday after

875
00:56:23.471 --> 00:56:27.250
playing a song by Grammy Award winner Lauryn Hill,
the grease man said,

876
00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:29.560
no wonder people,
drag them behind trucks.

877
00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:32.680
Reference to the killing of a black man in Jasper,
Texas,

878
00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:36.880
the grease man for years and equal opportunity offender later offered this

879
00:56:36.881 --> 00:56:37.714
apology.

880
00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:41.100
<v 15>I'm truly sorry for the pain and hurt I've caused with land feeling comment.</v>

881
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:45.330
I could take it back.
I would.
This is from mark was a grave error in my judgment.

882
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:47.520
<v 13>It sounded genuine.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

883
00:56:47.521 --> 00:56:52.521
He's doing his lackey voice as lawyer while due to Lama.

884
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:54.840
I'm sorry for saying racist Shit.

885
00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:00.150
Now you might think,
you know,

886
00:57:00.151 --> 00:57:04.350
maybe he slipped up once you know your dancing that line for four hours a day.

887
00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:06.720
You know you might make a mistake here and there.

888
00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:10.260
It's not the first time the grease man got in trouble.
Really?
No,

889
00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:14.420
<v 7>it wasn't the first time the grease man made a racially offensive remark.</v>

890
00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:18.440
Back in 1986 the grease man was talking about the Martin Luther King holiday and

891
00:57:18.441 --> 00:57:18.950
said,

892
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:23.600
kill for more and we can take a whole week off cause old station WWDC was

893
00:57:23.601 --> 00:57:26.190
picketed and the grease man defended his comments.

894
00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:29.410
<v 15>Anybody that listens to my show regularly and knows me personally,</v>

895
00:57:29.411 --> 00:57:32.800
he knows that I'm not a bigot.
I despise racism.

896
00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:37.650
<v 13>Hi.
She said I despise.
I don't think it's a good time by the way,</v>

897
00:57:37.651 --> 00:57:39.890
to wish everyone a happy Martin Luther King.
That's right.

898
00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:43.440
Today as we record the show and yes,
that's true.
Yes.

899
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:47.610
But we can celebrate the whole week as the grease man says.
Uh,
but yeah,

900
00:57:47.611 --> 00:57:51.000
he didn't get fired for that first comment.
We stayed on the air.

901
00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:54.710
There was outrage.
There was outrage for him in 86 yeah,

902
00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:59.110
that's how racist this shit was.
Yeah.
20 1986 they were like,

903
00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:01.760
you really shouldn't be talking again.

904
00:58:01.770 --> 00:58:06.770
In the second instance where he actually got fired was 99 so even Jesus,

905
00:58:06.901 --> 00:58:11.180
even then you could be a completed really push it.
But wow.

906
00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:16.200
Like every cockroach in this business.
He resurface in Jacksonville,

907
00:58:16.201 --> 00:58:17.034
Florida,

908
00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:22.710
and he stayed on the air there until 2010 and then they just,

909
00:58:22.711 --> 00:58:24.120
the station went in a different direction.

910
00:58:24.121 --> 00:58:27.360
He didn't even unceremoniously get fired from that job.
Believe it or not,

911
00:58:27.361 --> 00:58:30.330
he just,
and now he does an Internet radio show.

912
00:58:30.331 --> 00:58:32.280
So you can check the grease man out.
God,

913
00:58:32.281 --> 00:58:35.440
see if he's still slips up now he can say whatever the fuck he wants.
Sure.

914
00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:38.940
So everybody's saying the grease ball.
Um,

915
00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:42.180
w what kind of money you think he was making at the end there?
Oh,
at the end?

916
00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:46.640
Yeah.
Jacksonville.
Jacksonville stuff.
Yeah,
probably not much.
I'm going to say,

917
00:58:46.641 --> 00:58:51.540
I'm going to say like,
I'm going to say generously.
60 grand.
Really?
Yeah.

918
00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:55.590
Really.
It had to have been low.
I mean he was on the morning show.

919
00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:59.250
He was doing afternoon drive.
Okay.
So it's like the second,

920
00:58:59.251 --> 00:59:02.890
that's the second tier.
Yeah,
second best.
So that's first is morning.
Morning.
Yeah.

921
00:59:03.350 --> 00:59:05.190
The pride of the top.
That's the top pane.

922
00:59:05.191 --> 00:59:09.510
Then thrive time is the then afternoon drive.
Then maybe mid days and nights.

923
00:59:09.810 --> 00:59:14.700
Wow.
Yeah.
Or you can be like me and get a million jobs and do mornings,
nights,

924
00:59:15.150 --> 00:59:19.880
all of them and just get paid the same.
That's true.
That is cool.
Yeah.

925
00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:23.510
The grease man,
like it's not even really an attempt at humor.
That's a thing.

926
00:59:23.511 --> 00:59:27.980
It's just blatant.
Like shittery I think he would disagree.
Yeah.

927
00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:32.960
Wild would be funny is not,
not even to talk to him,

928
00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:38.810
to find the person who goes,
you know,
who really makes me laugh.

929
00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:42.680
The grease man.
That's who I would talk.
So it was like,
what?

930
00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:44.360
What's your favorite part?
You know,
he's like,

931
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:48.950
what's not fucking holding somebody does think he's,
that's what I'm saying.

932
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:54.040
He had a whole audience for all along ass
ugly,

933
01:00:00.570 --> 01:00:05.510
just to keep people's attention.
Hey guys,
gals,
like you got some great pipes.

934
01:00:06.930 --> 01:00:08.960
Is this last band and Rolf piece of garbage.

935
01:00:08.961 --> 01:00:13.280
This last man is actually my spirit animal.
He's,
he's my favorite.

936
01:00:13.281 --> 01:00:17.160
He's like a scumbag that I revere and he's like a special sort.

937
01:00:17.161 --> 01:00:20.510
So here's what it looks like.
It looks really well.
Real.
Uh,
yeah.

938
01:00:20.511 --> 01:00:25.170
He's a straight laced newsman actually from buffalo in Buffalo.
Yeah,

939
01:00:25.171 --> 01:00:27.860
he was totally straight lace.
We can listen to a little bit of him.

940
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:31.560
He didn't have the voice or anything.
He was totally buttoned up.
Uh,

941
01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:35.030
if you want to bring that clip up.
But yeah,
he worked in news radio,
Wgu,

942
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:38.170
<v 16>well 72 was the high where it's 66 degrees now.</v>

943
01:00:38.171 --> 01:00:40.840
The weather brought to you by settlers on the Bible,
a nine and a half.

944
01:00:40.841 --> 01:00:45.310
The GRF 55 surprise.
I want to try for somebody right now,

945
01:00:45.311 --> 01:00:47.820
see if I can get ahold of a contestant.
Yeah.

946
01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:51.210
<v 13>Yeah.
So yeah.
Basically he's a straight up news dude.
What's his name?</v>

947
01:00:51.330 --> 01:00:55.860
His name is Frank Benny.
And he was on in the sixties,
seventies,
eighties.

948
01:00:55.861 --> 01:00:58.620
He went all the way through the decades,
but uh,

949
01:00:58.621 --> 01:01:03.540
he had demons like so many do.
He had a big drinking problem.

950
01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:07.980
He also was a bit of a Gambler,
spent a lot of money on gambling.

951
01:01:08.550 --> 01:01:12.260
And what he did was one day in the 70s,
uh,

952
01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:16.590
he finished his broadcast at 10:00 AM,
left the studio,

953
01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:21.150
went back to a suburb of Buffalo Snyder and robbed a bank.

954
01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:26.130
Why?
Yeah.
Right after he got off the air.
Yup.
In the 70s.

955
01:01:26.131 --> 01:01:29.700
So you could still kind of get away with it back then?
Well,
he did not,
uh,

956
01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:31.940
moments later after the robbery,
he went in with a,

957
01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:35.400
a stocking over his face and a toy gun.
By the way.

958
01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:38.970
It was later found out it was to be a toy gun,
but after the robbery,
he,

959
01:01:38.971 --> 01:01:43.971
he left with about a $503 and went home to his home and Williamsville and was

960
01:01:45.661 --> 01:01:50.661
greeted by Amhurst police with guns drawn in his driveway and then had to do a

961
01:01:51.810 --> 01:01:53.940
real prison sentence.
No,

962
01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:58.650
he pled temporary insanity.
Wow.

963
01:01:58.710 --> 01:02:03.690
And got away with it and the judge sentenced him to two months in the hospital.

964
01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:08.490
Ah.
So he,
he went to the hospital for two months.

965
01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:12.450
Within six months of the robbery,
he was back on the air at Wgu.

966
01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:15.550
Yes.
Because he,
uh,

967
01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:18.960
was found guilty through temporary insanity there.

968
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:24.150
Public outcry and public sympathy and management recognized that and said,

969
01:02:24.151 --> 01:02:28.540
due to public sympathy,
we are going to give him his job.
Oh my God.

970
01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:33.480
Shit.
So he was fired.
He was fired.
Yeah,
of course.
And then they were like,
ah,

971
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:38.000
get the bank robber back in here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But this was the seventies you know,

972
01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:42.240
people were way less thrilled.
Would it be to rob a bank?

973
01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:46.650
You think so?
Think about it all.
Oh my God,
that's your crime.

974
01:02:46.651 --> 01:02:47.820
Like if you could do,
besides murder,

975
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:51.180
we know that's your number one favorite crime that you could do.
I mean,

976
01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.710
I think robbing a bank,

977
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:57.150
I can only imagine what the adrenaline rush is it the terror and people's eyes

978
01:02:57.151 --> 01:02:59.820
that you know,
it's,
that part would be fun.
I'll come.

979
01:02:59.821 --> 01:03:01.350
I mean that's fun to see up stuff.

980
01:03:01.351 --> 01:03:04.740
Course people crying and wondering if they're gonna make it right.
And women,

981
01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:08.570
I think,
you know,
the planning would you,
you would get like this dude,

982
01:03:08.571 --> 01:03:12.510
you'd have moments where you're like calm and then you know,
you do your,

983
01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:15.480
your casing,
the joint,
right?
Like your drive.
How's your,

984
01:03:15.481 --> 01:03:17.700
how are you going to drive out of here?
What's the response time?

985
01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:21.960
All your planning.
But like the day you're like,
I'm going to do it.
I mean,

986
01:03:21.961 --> 01:03:26.580
your heart rate must just be through the roof.
And when you walk in to do it,

987
01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:29.370
you've got to go disguise.
Right.
The mass things too crazy.

988
01:03:29.371 --> 01:03:32.430
You got to do something kind of cool to like a cool mask,
you know,

989
01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:37.000
do like a purge mask or I would like to do that dog mass.
But you got back there,

990
01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:41.540
the dog man.
What if they put out like an APB for the dog,
you know?
Yeah.

991
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:45.690
You hear them.
That'd be cool.
Then you get a cool name.
Yeah,
like an outlaw name.

992
01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:49.990
Yeah.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
The bark robber.
Yeah.

993
01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.990
I thought about this a lot.
When you're in a bank,

994
01:03:51.991 --> 01:03:56.070
do you ever think about a robber coming in and if you take action?
No,

995
01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:59.220
I was satisfied that this is the time.
I always say like,
what if it's right?

996
01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:02.890
Am I going to take action for a fucking bank robber?
No.
Well,

997
01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:06.560
here's where I would,
I would,
uh,
take action if the bank teller was a babe.

998
01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:10.110
Oh yeah.
And that's the only circumstance dude.
And that guy,

999
01:04:10.111 --> 01:04:12.520
the bank robber just takes the butt of a shotgun,

1000
01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:15.640
<v 17>smack your
everything,
your face.</v>

1001
01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:19.550
Oh my orbitals busted wide open.

1002
01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:23.200
Then you hear that babe telling the cops just like this fucking idiot friends.

1003
01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:30.730
You're like,
I was trying to help me.
I will fucking idiot.
Pretty Lady.

1004
01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:35.220
I want

1005
01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:39.280
<v 13>to do as a,
I'd want to steal a car.
I feel like that will be,
yeah,</v>

1006
01:04:39.290 --> 01:04:42.360
that'd be ultimate old route and that seems attainable as a goal.

1007
01:04:42.570 --> 01:04:45.570
I feel like I could learn how to do that now.
Do you want to know why?

1008
01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:48.000
I think frank Benny is a genius by the way.
Why?

1009
01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:52.950
Because it was a win win situation for him.
He thought he,

1010
01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:57.810
by the way,
he was on a crazy gambler.
He was in debt to the Mafia.
Oh,

1011
01:04:57.811 --> 01:05:00.570
that's why he robbed banks.
So he robbed the bank.
Oh.

1012
01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:03.990
If he got away with it and got money,
he could then pay the people back.

1013
01:05:04.410 --> 01:05:05.670
If he didn't get away with it.

1014
01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:10.020
It was high profile enough where the mafia couldn't fuck with them.
Right.
Oh,

1015
01:05:10.021 --> 01:05:11.100
that is so there are,

1016
01:05:11.101 --> 01:05:15.480
there are theories that that say that he was thinking that going in then he is a

1017
01:05:15.481 --> 01:05:19.180
fucking real genius.
Yeah.
Dude.
Who borrows money from the mob.

1018
01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:22.720
Like you really got to be in your addiction gambling in the 70s.

1019
01:05:22.721 --> 01:05:25.000
There was probably a common thing when you have a book,

1020
01:05:25.001 --> 01:05:28.270
you write so fucking crazy and uh,
yeah.

1021
01:05:28.271 --> 01:05:30.220
And they're the guys that I used to work for,

1022
01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:34.630
they have tapes of him cassette tapes from when they were working on the same

1023
01:05:34.631 --> 01:05:39.580
station late in this man's career where he is just blasted on the air.
I love it.

1024
01:05:39.610 --> 01:05:41.910
It's so fucking hilarious.
Who,
this guy.
Yes.

1025
01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:44.950
Cause he would drink on the air after months after a while,
you know,

1026
01:05:44.951 --> 01:05:49.840
and he'd just be on there like,
Oh yeah,
75 degrees and shit.
You know,

1027
01:05:49.841 --> 01:05:54.000
like he shit his pants.
Um,
don't forget the,
uh,
we use my up.

1028
01:05:54.070 --> 01:05:55.870
So when we watched it the other day,
we took our,

1029
01:05:55.871 --> 01:05:59.260
our like kind of Redo of our anniversary.
Yeah.
We uh,

1030
01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:04.110
we watched one of the rocks movies with scrape called sky,
sky,

1031
01:06:04.111 --> 01:06:06.990
sky scraper.
He has one leg,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1032
01:06:06.991 --> 01:06:10.690
And the leg and which has nothing to do with the story though,
right?

1033
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:12.900
It doesn't really matter that he has.
Right.

1034
01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:17.560
It's one of the dumbest fucking things I've ever seen in my life.
Um,

1035
01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:18.830
and you can tell that like it's got,

1036
01:06:18.831 --> 01:06:23.590
it has to have a hundred plus million dollar budget and it's one of those
movies.

1037
01:06:23.591 --> 01:06:26.320
You can start it up and go to the bathroom and I'll get up and go to the

1038
01:06:26.321 --> 01:06:28.270
bathroom.
And Tom's like,
do you want me to pause?
And I'm like,
no,

1039
01:06:28.271 --> 01:06:31.150
I can figure it out.
I have a feeling I know what's going to come back.

1040
01:06:31.151 --> 01:06:34.570
And you're like,
oh,
there's more screaming and blowing it up.
And yeah,
I got it.

1041
01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:38.020
It's so dumb.
But it's entertaining.
It was like,
it's like a,

1042
01:06:38.030 --> 01:06:42.400
it's a good one to waste time to popcorn flicks.
Yeah.

1043
01:06:42.401 --> 01:06:45.520
It's a real waste time.
But then we got to talking about it.
Right.

1044
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:47.590
What did we get to talking about?
Well,

1045
01:06:47.591 --> 01:06:51.340
we were looking at him and he's so big and he's so handsome and thinking,

1046
01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:55.660
we were thinking like,
how big is the rocks Dick?
Yeah.
Hmm.

1047
01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:57.873
<v 10>Right.</v>

1048
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:10.220
<v 13>What is the thing?
Well,
here's the deal,
man,</v>

1049
01:07:10.310 --> 01:07:14.150
is that we've been talking about the detectives for years and we've always,

1050
01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:18.380
what we've learned is that penis size is not proportionate necessarily to one

1051
01:07:18.381 --> 01:07:23.060
statutes.
It's true.
This is true.
So it could be deceiving.
He's a big guy,

1052
01:07:23.061 --> 01:07:25.130
but he could have a tiny Peter could it can.

1053
01:07:25.131 --> 01:07:29.000
You have no evidence to support or nothing.
It's just all,
it's all theory.

1054
01:07:29.001 --> 01:07:30.140
Speculation.
See,

1055
01:07:30.141 --> 01:07:35.141
I think the man works so hard and he is constantly overcompensating.

1056
01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:40.300
It's either for that small dick or it's because he can't shake his first failure

1057
01:07:42.951 --> 01:07:46.170
as a,
as a wrestler back in the day he was a failure as arrest.

1058
01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:50.120
There was a moment where he,
when he debuted as rocky my via,

1059
01:07:50.450 --> 01:07:54.610
he came out to silence.
Not Booze because booze and wrestling is like you,

1060
01:07:54.611 --> 01:07:57.680
you win.
It's the extremes.
The cheers and the booze.

1061
01:07:57.930 --> 01:08:00.780
She came out to just lukewarm reception.
This is,
wait,

1062
01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:03.820
this is a debut on the big stage?
Yes.
Oh,
okay.

1063
01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:06.260
He's like debut is like the blue chipper.

1064
01:08:06.261 --> 01:08:09.620
Rocky my via and he came out and no one gave a shit.
Well,

1065
01:08:09.621 --> 01:08:12.680
I will say that I enjoy watching him,
how I,

1066
01:08:12.681 --> 01:08:16.310
I've watched a few of his dumb movies.
There is another like hurricane.

1067
01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:21.200
<v 4>They're always like one third tornado waterfall.
Thank he.</v>

1068
01:08:21.201 --> 01:08:23.660
Overcompensates for a small Dick or I don't think so.

1069
01:08:23.661 --> 01:08:28.310
I find him to be deeply confident.
Actually I think he's grounded.

1070
01:08:28.410 --> 01:08:32.360
I think he's got a healthy hoggle I think donkey dick where the people are like,

1071
01:08:32.361 --> 01:08:33.500
get out of here with that thing.

1072
01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:38.390
But I think it's kind of appropriate for being six,

1073
01:08:38.391 --> 01:08:42.080
five and two 50 or whatever he is.
Like I think it,

1074
01:08:42.150 --> 01:08:46.470
it probably looks like it fits,
I think,

1075
01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:49.190
I mean probably has a decent piece.
Yeah.

1076
01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:54.180
But on the rock you're expecting this fucking right baby.

1077
01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:58.370
If you see the tracks and the,
and the shoulders,
you're just like,
well,

1078
01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:00.290
and I don't think it lives up to that.

1079
01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:04.460
So the Mediocre Dick on such a frame is disappointing.

1080
01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:09.260
But here's the thing,
even a regular size penis,
exact such a frame.

1081
01:09:09.290 --> 01:09:13.880
I mean it's going to look really small.
Oh,
definitely.
100%

1082
01:09:15.690 --> 01:09:18.470
if it's like,
like if it,
if he had like six and a half,

1083
01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:20.420
let's say seven and a half inches,

1084
01:09:20.421 --> 01:09:24.380
which is above the average size by a bit on him,
you'd be like,

1085
01:09:24.381 --> 01:09:28.640
what's that little fucking like night switch you got free because he's

1086
01:09:28.641 --> 01:09:30.980
essentially built like the incredible hall Kodaly.

1087
01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:33.470
So how old would you want it to be you,

1088
01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:38.030
you're to line up with what your expectations.
It should be 12 inches long,

1089
01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:39.950
nine inches in circumference.

1090
01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.670
It should have the same veins that pop out of his neck and his arms.

1091
01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.100
And you'd be like,
yeah,
that,

1092
01:09:45.101 --> 01:09:47.780
that'll kill some rocks because he's such a specimen.

1093
01:09:47.781 --> 01:09:50.130
You expect his dick can also be

1094
01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:56.150
a problem is that our expectations are so high for his daughter looked at me.

1095
01:09:56.170 --> 01:09:59.330
Yeah.
Low expectations.
Low expectations.
I'm going to blow you out of the water.

1096
01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:02.240
Oh yeah.
If you're just four and a half and it,
you know,

1097
01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:06.110
I don't know if it still works.
You put the rock stick on me.
Yes.

1098
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:09.170
How can I track my big thing about you that I didn't realize?

1099
01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:12.950
I thought when you were talking about your delayed ejaculation.
Yeah.

1100
01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:15.710
And how it's,
you can't come with women.

1101
01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:20.150
I thought you meant like every once in a while that's what happens.

1102
01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:23.030
Like in other words,
in verse of that,
actually I didn't understand.

1103
01:10:23.031 --> 01:10:27.530
I thought you meant like,
oh,
I can't come all the time with women,

1104
01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:29.780
but Tom all the time,

1105
01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:35.150
even when you're alone,
you know I can do it alone when I'm with,

1106
01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:40.250
when another person is aiding me in that task,
I can't,
it's like,

1107
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:42.380
it feels like stage fright when you're at a urinal.

1108
01:10:44.210 --> 01:10:46.670
So it's like eventually I have to like take over and be like,

1109
01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:50.470
I'll take care of your dogs.
Never.
Like,
I'm like,
I'm ready.
Let's get it out.
Like,

1110
01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:55.610
I mean it is and it isn't.
I mean it is and it can't do it.
It just,
it's like,

1111
01:10:55.670 --> 01:10:57.230
it stays hard.
It's there.

1112
01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:01.820
It's acting appropriately except for the fact that it just has no punctuation

1113
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:06.680
moment.
But when you're alone,
everything's,
yeah,
I make myself rock out.
Yeah.

1114
01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:08.660
Easy.
So do most of your,

1115
01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:12.740
your sexual endeavors and with like,
you know,

1116
01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:17.070
nothing happens with the girl.
And then when she leaves you're like,
okay,

1117
01:11:17.071 --> 01:11:20.340
now finish myself.
I usually finish while she's there.
Oh really?
Yeah.

1118
01:11:20.341 --> 01:11:23.100
I can do it myself.
Oh,
you're like,
I'll take care of it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1119
01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:26.670
And she parties like she watched it depends how involved she wants to get some

1120
01:11:26.671 --> 01:11:31.530
of them just kind of like [inaudible] of her.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing.
I mean,
not,

1121
01:11:31.531 --> 01:11:35.100
not nothing.
I know,
but I mean,
you don't finish,
right.
God.

1122
01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.700
And what did doctor jury say to you about that?
He went,

1123
01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:40.430
he was in the same mom basically said,
you're just disagree.
He's like,

1124
01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:43.540
you got to find a way to have her get involved with you.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1125
01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:47.340
I got to basically get myself to that point and then like hope and then back,

1126
01:11:47.341 --> 01:11:50.770
she hade finish it off on your mouth and your eyes.
That's not gonna.
Yeah.

1127
01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:55.010
Or have her take over.
That's,
no,
no,
no.
You finish it.
But she's involved.

1128
01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:59.260
I don't know.
I don't know.
Crazy.
Yeah,
it is.
Why wild that you don't,
you can't.

1129
01:11:59.261 --> 01:11:59.390
Yeah,

1130
01:11:59.390 --> 01:12:03.930
<v 17>you don't even,

uh,</v>

1131
01:12:04.510 --> 01:12:09.100

that I'm getting
weird sometimes how it ends.
Like,

1132
01:12:11.490 --> 01:12:15.960
<v 4>Oh,
I've got to imagine that women feel very insecure when this happens.</v>

1133
01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:18.870
I would probably,
I've got to admit,
I would probably be like,
why?

1134
01:12:18.871 --> 01:12:22.950
Why can't I do this?
And we're fucked up relationships.
Oh,

Oh yeah.
Oh,

1135
01:12:22.951 --> 01:12:25.830
I bet.
And if you're like,
you're just not hot.
That's,

1136
01:12:27.330 --> 01:12:31.930
we got to get the rock to comment on a are you think you'll was for us?

This is long overdue and we finally got him here.

1148
01:13:20.871 --> 01:13:24.050
He is a comedian,
a director,

1149
01:13:24.410 --> 01:13:29.410
and one of the highest ranking white people on the black culture world.

1150
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:36.590
I'm a like,
I'm a lieutenant.
You're like a lieutenant amongst black culture.

1151
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:41.210
It is Neal Brennan.
Yes.
Well,
yes.
No,

1152
01:13:41.211 --> 01:13:45.110
I want to explain why I want to be here,
which is I don't listen to the podcast,

1153
01:13:45.111 --> 01:13:48.120
but I watched the fuck out of the clips.
Right.
You know,

1154
01:13:48.121 --> 01:13:51.230
I watch the fuck out of here.
Out of a,
of an Instagram,
right?
Yeah.

1155
01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:56.800
I want to know anytime I've posted anything related to you,

1156
01:13:58.010 --> 01:14:01.820
my comments will be flooded with language.

1157
01:14:01.821 --> 01:14:06.590
That's like fucking ORC language.
It's like trying like mom jeans,
the jeans.
Yeah,

1158
01:14:06.690 --> 01:14:08.870
gene.
So I just,
okay,

1159
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:11.710
so what can we go through?

1160
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:17.100
Just a glossary for the uninitiated.
Sure.
What's with the jeans?

1161
01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:18.680
Yeah.
Yes,
yes.

1162
01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:23.500
So you probably explained it before that it makes sense.
We get asked a lot,

1163
01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:28.180
especially people who go like,
Hey,
I just got into the podcast two weeks ago.

1164
01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:33.340
What the fuck is going on?
And there's a lot to cover a lot.
There's a lot though,

1165
01:14:33.341 --> 01:14:36.010
but to be so we should start with the basics.
Janes is probably a base.

1166
01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:40.870
What the show is based on jeans is like the premise of star wars.
It's the force.

1167
01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:45.810
It's what we're inside.
It doesn't mean anything.

1168
01:14:46.350 --> 01:14:46.630
Okay.

1169
01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:51.630
It comes from the whole thing is based on lingo that the genes things is based

1170
01:14:51.761 --> 01:14:53.200
on lingo from our relationship.

1171
01:14:53.201 --> 01:14:58.201
Meaning it was like we started to call each other as a joke when we're living in

1172
01:14:59.201 --> 01:15:02.440
an apartment.
It's like you're leaving for the day.
I'd be like,
I'm leaving,

1173
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:04.270
I'll be back later.
Mommy.
Right.
Like,

1174
01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:10.500
and then that evolved into mommy jeans and then that evolved into dropping mommy

1175
01:15:12.131 --> 01:15:15.340
and just saying genes and then you know what I mean?
It's just like

1176
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:18.390
it started to you,

1177
01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:23.320
do you know how you see somebody who wears like jeans that are too high and too

1178
01:15:23.321 --> 01:15:24.580
tight and you'll get the fuck is it?

1179
01:15:24.850 --> 01:15:29.720
So we started to say basically that that person's got it going on like that.

1180
01:15:29.790 --> 01:15:32.250
That guy is living life the right way.
Like,

1181
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:36.730
where am high and tight and that when you fuck up when you do something stupid

1182
01:15:36.731 --> 01:15:40.810
or embarrassing is cause your genes are low and loose.
Oh.
So it was,

1183
01:15:40.811 --> 01:15:44.170
we flipped that on its head.
So like if we do something and people were like,

1184
01:15:44.171 --> 01:15:48.010
that wasn't cool.
Somebody things are a little Wikipedia page with all this.

1185
01:15:48.011 --> 01:15:52.870
And that's probably a good idea for real.
Cause it's,
there's,
it's,
it's,
it's lore.

1186
01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:57.900
Somebody created a page of the sound drops and like over a thousand sound drops

1187
01:15:58.691 --> 01:16:03.130
are on it.
Wow.
Like they,
they put,
is there stuff that you guys go,

1188
01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:06.670
like,
let's not do this on the sheet.
This is just for us still.

1189
01:16:07.450 --> 01:16:10.090
This is just for the house.
I don't know.
That's not really,

1190
01:16:11.230 --> 01:16:14.200
why would you throw it away like that and throw it away on your relationship?

1191
01:16:14.230 --> 01:16:17.950
Yeah.
There's stuff that's just a Kansan translate to this show right now.

1192
01:16:17.951 --> 01:16:21.370
Tom and I are hooked on this Martin Lawrence joke from like a decade ago.

1193
01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.233
And we just like,

1194
01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:26.080
we do it to each other and then like sometimes we'll play the clip,
but it's uh,

1195
01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:30.630
it's when he was talking about that dance,
the Cha Cha slide and just,

1196
01:16:30.810 --> 01:16:33.530
we just get hooked on a phrase.
Yeah,
of course.

1197
01:16:33.570 --> 01:16:37.480
So he was making fun of dances and like,
he's like,
that shit,

1198
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:43.210
I can't even say it.
He's like,
no,
he's like,
dances used to be like real.

1199
01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:43.751
And he's like,

1200
01:16:43.751 --> 01:16:48.640
now it's like do move your hips like this one time now keep moving your hip like

1201
01:16:48.641 --> 01:16:49.900
days.
And that's it.

1202
01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:54.330
And he's like e z and like we just keep fucking saying,

1203
01:16:55.930 --> 01:17:00.880
stop thinking about it.
You put,
that's what I,
I'm always impressed in your rack,

1204
01:17:00.910 --> 01:17:04.990
how many other peoples are just,
you do,

1205
01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:09.550
you've made a,
you'll take other people's phrases.
Yeah.

1206
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:14.300
And make,
you'll build a fucking castle around them.

1207
01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:16.010
And it's like,

1208
01:17:16.011 --> 01:17:21.011
bikes is like the best example where I have a million of those and I would never

1209
01:17:23.691 --> 01:17:27.500
think to explain in your yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1210
01:17:27.530 --> 01:17:29.510
But I've been fucking million of those.

1211
01:17:29.511 --> 01:17:33.800
Like just dumb things like downbeat in your head.
That's exactly what it is.

1212
01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:38.130
Just this show is dumb hooks in your head.
Yeah.
And sharing them.
Yes.
Yeah.

1213
01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:41.390
And then it,
and then it naturally evolves into your standup,
right?
Like,

1214
01:17:41.391 --> 01:17:45.770
so the bikes thing was like the bikes came,
came from the podcast.

1215
01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:47.660
It was not stand up.
It was,

1216
01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:52.340
we were playing a scared straight 99 right.
Which is the one off.

1217
01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:55.430
So it wasn't a show was a special one time special.
It was MTV,

1218
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:58.830
it was MTV and the air uncensored,
which was banana.

1219
01:17:59.330 --> 01:18:01.910
And that guy was just,

1220
01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:07.040
I mean he stole the show and he was fucking verbally abusive to these kids,

1221
01:18:07.041 --> 01:18:11.660
but in a really it was,
he reminded me of like Robin Harris.
Yeah.
And he was,

1222
01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:15.950
he was like,
you big slat fat,
sloppy motherfucker.
Like saying shit like that.

1223
01:18:15.951 --> 01:18:17.720
And I was like,
oh,
just wait.

1224
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:20.480
Is this line right there is an original one from like the eight there's one

1225
01:18:20.481 --> 01:18:25.010
before that.
Way crazier.
It was,
it was,
well it was tea that those guys,

1226
01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:29.450
it was the 70s there was the 70s people were different.
People were different.

1227
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:34.700
So this ones were different.
And they didn't,
they didn't have books.

1228
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:39.230
They didn't have a this guy slit,
right?
No,
you're right.
Yeah.
This guy,

1229
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:43.520
he doesn't think that's hilarious.
As you watched that thing man,

1230
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:46.190
one of the kids doesn't want to do and you know that,

1231
01:18:46.191 --> 01:18:48.830
you know that the kids ultimately are not going to get hurt.

1232
01:18:48.831 --> 01:18:52.790
But these guys really tow the line and he,

1233
01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:55.100
that guy who screams bikes is telling this kid does.

1234
01:18:55.101 --> 01:18:59.750
He's like a pot of jam and as he's saying apologized,
he gets this far.

1235
01:18:59.810 --> 01:19:04.400
I mean he gets this far and as he's saying it spit is fine off of his lip and

1236
01:19:04.401 --> 01:19:07.610
he's like I know you don't like no one motherfucker spitting in your face and he

1237
01:19:07.611 --> 01:19:11.450
likes it is flying in his face and they called him a faggot and they're just

1238
01:19:11.451 --> 01:19:13.970
saying really crazy shit.

1239
01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:17.930
But you know because you're like on the show you're like it's not going to like

1240
01:19:17.931 --> 01:19:19.280
he's not going to hit him.
Yeah.

1241
01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:21.940
Cause he's also going to get another 10 years if he hits them.

1242
01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:25.790
Absolutely starts saying all this shit.
And he is saying shit like,
oh,

1243
01:19:25.850 --> 01:19:28.640
like the things I said in my act about it,
like how he's like,

1244
01:19:28.641 --> 01:19:30.830
I'm gonna make you suck my dick every day.
And he,

1245
01:19:30.910 --> 01:19:34.130
he says that shit to him and it's also heightened.
Like he,

1246
01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:38.960
the whole time he screams and yells the entire time says motherfucker like a

1247
01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:42.470
thousand times.
And then if you look up,
they didn't air it on that,

1248
01:19:42.471 --> 01:19:46.940
but if you look up like the followup piece,
MTV did,
they cut to that prisoner,

1249
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.590
this guy right here.
And they're like,
uh,
like tell us about the experience.

1250
01:19:51.591 --> 01:19:53.510
And he's like,
well,
you know,
it's great to be able to help these kids

1251
01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:59.600
completely flipped.
So like he's like,
you know,
we,
we do that so that they learn,

1252
01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:02.360
they'll come back and you're like,
dude,

1253
01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:06.920
like nothing about your message was ever like seen control.

1254
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:12.930
I wonder if that ever works.
What they can't prove know they can't prove like,

1255
01:20:12.931 --> 01:20:16.830
well I was going to do crime.
And you know that they got one of the guys on that.

1256
01:20:17.130 --> 01:20:17.911
I mean,
first of all,

1257
01:20:17.911 --> 01:20:21.510
multiple people who have been part of the scared straight stuff have violated.

1258
01:20:21.511 --> 01:20:22.950
Again,
the bikes kid,

1259
01:20:22.951 --> 01:20:27.570
the kid that got yelled at it was going back to jail when I was doing,

1260
01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:28.920
like after I did the special,

1261
01:20:29.370 --> 01:20:32.970
I met somebody who was in class with him in the middle of school and they're

1262
01:20:32.971 --> 01:20:34.530
like,
he's going back to jail.
And they're like,

1263
01:20:34.531 --> 01:20:36.270
he caught hell for that when it aired.

1264
01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:40.260
But there's a guy who's on the scared straight special where they do the

1265
01:20:40.450 --> 01:20:45.000
followup on MTV and they're like,
how did it help you know you?
And he's like,

1266
01:20:45.001 --> 01:20:47.940
I totally straighten my life away.
Or you can look this up.

1267
01:20:48.150 --> 01:20:52.580
He was found later guilty of murder and burying a body.

1268
01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:53.733
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1269
01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:58.020
He's on the special and he's one of the kids who you think is kind of like,

1270
01:20:58.021 --> 01:21:02.460
has it together.
Like wow,
he murdered somebody later.
Yeah,
yeah,

1271
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:06.420
yeah.
And he was like,
he's like,
I have kids now and I,
I live my life this way.

1272
01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:11.910
Total psycho murder someone.
Hmm.
Um,
okay.
Bikes.
Uh,

1273
01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:16.290
all right.
So,
let,
let's just go with the,
who's Randy,

1274
01:21:16.530 --> 01:21:21.270
who was Randy that is really,
really deep in the vault.

1275
01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:25.370
<v 18>It's the order in the,
in the bumping it goes like,</v>

1276
01:21:25.371 --> 01:21:26.910
don't even put it in a loving and

1277
01:21:30.210 --> 01:21:33.370
<v 4>Mr t don't break anyone's mom into dad.</v>

1278
01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:38.790
When we were building the show into the universe,
it was,

1279
01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:42.900
it was exactly what you said where it was like head hooks like just drops in

1280
01:21:42.901 --> 01:21:43.850
your head earliest.

1281
01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:48.120
And it was also like mom themed cause your mom's house was supposed to be

1282
01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:51.450
something silly to say to someone like listen to you.
You know,

1283
01:21:51.810 --> 01:21:52.860
like when you say it,
people are like,

1284
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:55.450
we need your mom's like they get kind of like black.

1285
01:21:56.270 --> 01:21:58.680
Cause we literally sat down at our dinner table and we were like,

1286
01:21:58.681 --> 01:22:01.920
what's the dumbest thing you could name a podcast stupid as saying your mom's

1287
01:22:01.921 --> 01:22:05.880
house.
Yeah.
So all right.
So it goes,
this shit is big time,
right?

1288
01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:10.080
That's what the first,
who was that?
That's a coach.
Uh,
ice.

1289
01:22:10.081 --> 01:22:11.070
Tim Ice Harris.

1290
01:22:11.170 --> 01:22:16.170
<v 18>[inaudible] so funny because it's like meeting my heroes like,</v>

1291
01:22:20.850 --> 01:22:23.530
oh Mike,
have you never seen year the bowl?

1292
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:27.990
<v 4>No.
Okay.
So one of the first things that we profile,
I don't know who's Julie,</v>

1293
01:22:28.050 --> 01:22:28.883
we'll get to,
yeah.

1294
01:22:30.230 --> 01:22:34.710
So the first thing that we did is we,
we,

1295
01:22:34.711 --> 01:22:38.700
one of the first things we profiled,
the documentary Stevie,
Stevie,
right,

1296
01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:44.690
is real fun hoop dreams made Steve.
Yes,
exactly right.
Okay.

1297
01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:49.320
So we played that and we dissected it for,
I dunno,
you know,

1298
01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:53.400
I'm Dad I've ever known and like all this fun drops.

1299
01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:55.890
And then the next was a documentary called year of the bolt,

1300
01:22:55.891 --> 01:23:00.891
which features the Miami Northwestern Bulls in Liberty City,

1301
01:23:01.201 --> 01:23:04.620
Miami,
which has produced at the time of the documentary,

1302
01:23:04.621 --> 01:23:05.980
which is more than 10 years

1303
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:09.520
<v 5>old.
It had already produced 19 NFL players.</v>

1304
01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:13.130
So a bonkers program.
And uh,

1305
01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:16.990
there's just like some crazy just phrases and things screamed in there.

1306
01:23:17.230 --> 01:23:18.190
So it was like,

1307
01:23:18.191 --> 01:23:22.150
it was a perfect way to open the show is like the guy saying this shit is big

1308
01:23:22.151 --> 01:23:25.620
time.
The show is starting this shit big time.
Um,

1309
01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:27.640
then your mom's house don't bring anyone's mother and to this,

1310
01:23:27.641 --> 01:23:29.090
which is Mr t two t

1311
01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:32.800
<v 18>and Psa from the 80s about kids insulting each other.</v>

1312
01:23:32.801 --> 01:23:35.700
And bullying each other and they were doing your mama jokes or whatever.

1313
01:23:35.701 --> 01:23:38.290
And it's like,
don't bring in one's mother and this,
and he likes,

1314
01:23:38.291 --> 01:23:39.550
separates the kids.

1315
01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:44.630
So that's Mr t and then mom was a fucking fucking stance.
That's,

1316
01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:49.340
wait,
that's coaching for that.
Who is Randy now?
That's a,
that is a random one.

1317
01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:52.530
Really,
really dark.
All right,

1318
01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:56.480
so real sports on HBO.
So,
okay.

1319
01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:58.710
So there's one,
they've done a number,

1320
01:23:58.730 --> 01:24:03.190
almost did a sketch on Chappelle's show based around a hook from real sports.

1321
01:24:03.191 --> 01:24:05.650
Really.
Vj Singh,

1322
01:24:06.130 --> 01:24:11.130
the Golfer who's like Indonesian had beef with his caddy and this was the pitch

1323
01:24:14.381 --> 01:24:19.270
or this is reality.
What had beef with his caddy.

1324
01:24:19.271 --> 01:24:22.240
The caddy said he was an asshole.
And a,

1325
01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:26.140
and Vj Singh said like talking about the caddies,
it's like,

1326
01:24:26.141 --> 01:24:28.330
well there's his name,
the cat,
his name was Dave.
And he's goes,

1327
01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:32.870
there's things you don't know about Dave.
Um,
uh,

1328
01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:35.710
he drinks and then he goes,

1329
01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:39.460
he comes to work smelling of drink.

1330
01:24:40.610 --> 01:24:44.170
So I mean,
just go,
we'll just say smelling of drinks.
Hans drink,

1331
01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:49.050
drink hardcore fine.
Yeah,
yeah.
Smelling of Drake.

1332
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:54.240
Smelling of drink.
Yeah.
So should we just,
this is a sidetrack,
but like did,
um,

1333
01:24:54.850 --> 01:24:55.180
did

1334
01:24:55.180 --> 01:25:00.100
<v 5>you know you,
for people who don't know you cocreated wrote and directed,
um,</v>

1335
01:25:01.150 --> 01:25:05.770
Chappelle show and obviously one of the most famous celebrate a successful

1336
01:25:05.771 --> 01:25:07.660
sketch shows of all time.
Did you,

1337
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:12.060
did you guys like riff to come up with sketches,
isn't it?
Yeah,

1338
01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:16.330
<v 18>that most of the part of that was,
uh,
we would,</v>

1339
01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:21.490
it was more like,
like the real world.
I'm trying to think of like specific,

1340
01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:23.410
the blind white supremacists thing.

1341
01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:28.330
Chappelle's grandfather was blind and super light skin.

1342
01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:31.990
So the day Martin Luther King got shot,

1343
01:25:31.991 --> 01:25:36.991
he was on a bus and he heard these black dudes like,

1344
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:42.280
like menacing a white dude,
like,
and then he realized that it was him,
like,

1345
01:25:42.281 --> 01:25:44.680
what the fuck are you doing on this bus?
Cracking did it.
And he was like,
oh,

1346
01:25:44.681 --> 01:25:46.690
this dude's and draw.
And he's like,
oh,
it's me.
Oh,

1347
01:25:46.691 --> 01:25:50.440
they're yelling at me yelling at him because he was light skinned and he thought

1348
01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:54.850
so they thought he was white.
Uh,
so that was based,
that was the basis of that.

1349
01:25:54.851 --> 01:25:59.170
And then we just built out from there has to be one of the,
in my opinion,

1350
01:25:59.171 --> 01:26:04.070
best comedy sketches of all times.
Yeah,
it's fucking awesome.
Gets a great sketch.

1351
01:26:04.071 --> 01:26:07.930
Like there's just a bunch of really good jokes in it.
And,
and you know,
you see,

1352
01:26:07.931 --> 01:26:11.270
by the way,
it was one of my,
I obviously didn't know you.
Yeah,

1353
01:26:11.271 --> 01:26:14.870
you were like an Easter egg in so many sketches now.
And thinking back,

1354
01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:18.130
I haven't seen those.
My head exploded.
My father,

1355
01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:23.010
one of my favorites was um,
black Gallagher.
Yeah,
we're mandating that,

1356
01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:27.740
but the volume is down and you go pee on me.
You black son of a bitch.

1357
01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:33.040
He on me and I said,
smash some fruit.
You're black.

1358
01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:39.080
I think it was [inaudible] pills at pee on me.
You black son of a bitch.

1359
01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:42.350
I laughed so hard at the,

1360
01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:44.930
I remember I was watching that with sickler cause that was,

1361
01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:48.510
that was back when it was,
something's going to air and you've got to watch that.

1362
01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:51.650
And we would,
we would like go back and like,
I feel like he caught that.

1363
01:26:51.651 --> 01:26:55.070
He's like,
did you hear what this guy said?
And we would like Tivo over rewind.

1364
01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:58.520
Yeah.
You had to work for it.
Yeah,
that was great.
Yeah,

1365
01:26:58.521 --> 01:27:00.860
that was like under like it was like mixed it low.

1366
01:27:01.150 --> 01:27:04.010
I've mixed a nice and well that was good.
Um,
yeah,

1367
01:27:04.011 --> 01:27:08.490
like a real world was a thing like kind of,

1368
01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:13.160
it was greed that we'd Chappelle's friend had been on the second season.

1369
01:27:13.550 --> 01:27:15.340
Dave Edwards,
he was a comic.
He was the one who went,

1370
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:19.280
pulled the blanket and then got in trouble and like Chapelle was on the phone

1371
01:27:19.281 --> 01:27:20.810
with him when it happened.

1372
01:27:20.811 --> 01:27:23.960
So like we'd always sort of thought about the real world.

1373
01:27:23.961 --> 01:27:26.900
It's like they just make black dudes look bad.
And then we figured like,

1374
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:30.350
so did you the first draft most of this stuff like would you like here like

1375
01:27:30.351 --> 01:27:33.080
here's a version and then you guys,
ah,
we would know.

1376
01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:36.300
We would like literally sit in a room together and type it up.
Yeah.

1377
01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:40.790
Like type type,
type,
type,
type,
type,
type,
type type.
You go like,

1378
01:27:40.791 --> 01:27:42.090
it wasn't like a,

1379
01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:47.530
I think people see it as like either Dave's the genius and I'm his typist or I'm

1380
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:55.520
the like,
all right.
I'm like tell Dave what to do when it's like,
oh,

1381
01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:58.910
or were both funny.
Yeah.
I don't know if that'd be possible.

1382
01:27:58.911 --> 01:28:02.840
No possible one of you has.
Okay.
Um,
how did you get,

1383
01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:07.370
and at that point are you guys like you guys were friends and Zach?
I work,

1384
01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:11.240
I work,
I met him when I worked at the door of the comedy club in New York,

1385
01:28:11.241 --> 01:28:12.061
the Boston Comedy Club.

1386
01:28:12.061 --> 01:28:15.530
Like in the early nineties I was going to school and then,
uh,

1387
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:19.100
and then I,
my brother's comics,
so I was working,

1388
01:28:19.130 --> 01:28:21.950
I like got a job working in the door.
He showed you the ropes,
your brother,

1389
01:28:21.951 --> 01:28:26.300
like how he basically like he would bring me around.
But like in the 80s,

1390
01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:29.270
the late eighties,
like,
so the cool thing was like,

1391
01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:34.760
I knew what tell when he was an open mic or I knew crazy.
I mean,
how old are you?

1392
01:28:34.761 --> 01:28:39.290
65 get basically,
no,
I was 16 when I was like,
that's crazy.
When I was,

1393
01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:43.010
I was in high school and like knew a tail and Romano and all these guys that

1394
01:28:43.011 --> 01:28:47.330
like,
we're barely,
if making a living,
barely making a living.
Like really,

1395
01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:52.390
I remember Romano got fired from a news radio.

1396
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:58.230
Joe replaced him,
remodel,
got fired and I remembered thinking,
well,

1397
01:28:58.250 --> 01:29:01.950
all of us were like,
how was Ray gonna make a living?
Right?

1398
01:29:01.951 --> 01:29:05.400
Like he's got kids like,
and then,
but we were all like,

1399
01:29:05.401 --> 01:29:09.990
he's really fucking funny.
So he will hold it together.
He figured it out.
Yeah.

1400
01:29:10.350 --> 01:29:11.760
Um,
but,
uh,

1401
01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:15.990
but so I knew like me and trouble with the only young guys and Jay Mohr,
um,

1402
01:29:16.090 --> 01:29:18.820
and like these guys read Johnny,
the Round Guy,
they were like,

1403
01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:23.550
they were a comedy team.
John Dimaggio does a,
he's the voice of,
uh,

1404
01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:26.510
like a bunch of cartoons.
Like he doesn't like,
he does like,
uh,

1405
01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:30.070
he was on a future Futurama.
He's like the robot I think.
Yeah.
Um,

1406
01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:34.330
so we were the only like young dudes and like me and Dave got along really well.

1407
01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:40.350
And then I moved out here to write for like singled out on MTV and all that on

1408
01:29:41.171 --> 01:29:45.070
Nickelodeon.
And then me and Chappelle where it's still always friends.

1409
01:29:45.071 --> 01:29:47.730
We wrote half baked,
uh,

1410
01:29:47.740 --> 01:29:51.550
and then we sort of like drifted at for a second and then,

1411
01:29:51.551 --> 01:29:54.380
cause that epic was sort of a tank.
And then so what was that a tank?

1412
01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:57.660
Cause isn't it funny to be a part of something that I know that now like,
yeah.

1413
01:29:57.730 --> 01:30:01.360
And it was like,
oh no,
that fuck my career up.
Yeah.
It's so weird.
Right?

1414
01:30:01.370 --> 01:30:05.420
I love that you guys all think it's this fucking via the other one.
That's,

1415
01:30:05.450 --> 01:30:07.100
I mean like he's super successful,

1416
01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:12.160
but like box office didn't do well was a idiocracy that Mike paid shit.

1417
01:30:14.151 --> 01:30:18.560
But like you talk to people that accuracy accuracy is my favorite movie.

1418
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:23.000
Like stop finding funding the movie.
Like he was fucked up.

1419
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:26.360
Like he wasn't going well.
Like that was a disaster for him.

1420
01:30:26.361 --> 01:30:31.220
So now people love it.
Yeah.
They love it.
Yeah.
But,
uh,
but yeah,

1421
01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:36.260
like they're horrible box office,
horrible opened against titanic.
Oh Shit.

1422
01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:40.790
Uh,
golden eye,
goodwill hunting.
Oh my God,
man.

1423
01:30:40.791 --> 01:30:43.250
Something and maybe big Lebowski.

1424
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:48.350
I think what I love about the movie business too is like people are really,

1425
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:50.780
you know,

1426
01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:55.280
hopeful for box office and talk to you a certain way and like if your movie

1427
01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:57.920
doesn't do well,
they were like,
you're a piece of shit.

1428
01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:02.270
They literally look at you like your,

1429
01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:07.670
your garbage.
I SPUs cause I remember I went to the,
again,

1430
01:31:07.671 --> 01:31:10.910
I'm s I'm going to tell stories that make me sound like I'm a million years old.

1431
01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:14.780
I went to the bowfinger premiere.
Yeah.
And uh,

1432
01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:18.200
and it was a universal movie.
It was later.
It was like the same year as happy.

1433
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:20.270
And the head of universal looked at me like,

1434
01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:24.500
you're a fucking retarded piece of garbage.
And I was like,

1435
01:31:24.670 --> 01:31:27.150
I literally was like,
all right,
I'm never going on premiere again.

1436
01:31:27.151 --> 01:31:31.930
I really haven't gone since.
And uh,
and it's just,
they,
it's this,

1437
01:31:32.170 --> 01:31:36.710
they act like they didn't have anything to do with it.
They act like they,

1438
01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:40.090
it's,
I would say it's like mission impossible,
where like if this fails,

1439
01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:41.640
there's no record.
They,

1440
01:31:41.650 --> 01:31:45.970
they act like they had their just divorced themselves completely.
And uh,

1441
01:31:46.030 --> 01:31:47.560
and they,
and then the thing of like,

1442
01:31:47.570 --> 01:31:50.360
have you guys ever had the thing where people act like they haven't met you?

1443
01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:54.880
Yeah.
And then you're like,
I met,
I'm a fucking,

1444
01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:58.000
all human beings are good at is remembering faces,

1445
01:31:58.001 --> 01:32:02.980
like the fact that you're acting like,
did we meet,
shut it.

1446
01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:07.030
Um,
and I always like if someone,

1447
01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:10.720
I feel like they're going to act like we didn't meet,
we'll be like,
hey man,

1448
01:32:10.721 --> 01:32:14.290
we met.
It's like,

1449
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:18.400
have you ever had now like somebody,
you're like,
oh,
I'm doing a whatever Gig in,

1450
01:32:18.401 --> 01:32:20.450
uh,
San Diego.
And they're like,
Oh,
who you,

1451
01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:23.590
who are you working with who opened before?
And you're like,
really?
Yeah,
no,

1452
01:32:23.591 --> 01:32:27.130
I'm not open for of it.
Yeah.
Um,
some,
uh,
yeah,
so,
uh,

1453
01:32:28.270 --> 01:32:32.860
the,
um,
yeah,
so that's how I knew Dave.
So he was,

1454
01:32:32.890 --> 01:32:36.640
his career was fucked up after half baked,
I felt bad.
Uh,

1455
01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:41.060
like they literally sit on CNN.
His career was over from that movie.

1456
01:32:41.650 --> 01:32:45.100
The review said his career's over and like his mom saw it,
but I don't,

1457
01:32:45.130 --> 01:32:49.460
I fucking don't bring anyone small
details of it.

1458
01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:52.120
I feel like I saw some doc or something that said,

1459
01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:57.430
I think before your guys' show that he'd had like nine pilots.
Oh yeah.

1460
01:32:57.431 --> 01:33:01.420
He'd done like,
well that was like,
he kept doing like these fucking sitcoms.

1461
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:03.620
That was his production company at the time,

1462
01:33:04.170 --> 01:33:05.920
but it was called that from the beginning,

1463
01:33:05.921 --> 01:33:09.550
which I think he knew I'm going to be doing a lot of these fucking pilots.

1464
01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:13.270
He did pilots again.
How old I am.

1465
01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:15.000
He was doing a pot.

1466
01:33:15.001 --> 01:33:20.001
I remember him doing a pilot and me talking and during the La riots.

1467
01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:25.180
Really?
Yes.
I almost got run over by a car during the La riots.

1468
01:33:25.181 --> 01:33:28.990
I was in New York when he was here.
He did a pilot 25 years ago.
Yeah,

1469
01:33:28.991 --> 01:33:33.070
he did a pilot in 1992 or three.
1992 how old is Chappelle?

1470
01:33:33.130 --> 01:33:37.150
45 Oh my God.
But he started when he was 14 was like,

1471
01:33:37.151 --> 01:33:39.910
I was in high school during the riots.
I was like 10th grade or something.
Yeah,

1472
01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:44.290
he was,
we were ninth,
18th.
She's is crushable hold on.

1473
01:33:44.291 --> 01:33:46.310
Just that.

1474
01:33:46.330 --> 01:33:51.330
But also I just want to say that one of the most amazing,

1475
01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:57.970
you know,
I really don't get that.
I'm wowed by it.

1476
01:33:57.971 --> 01:34:00.910
Like celebrity stories or someone's,
someone's met.
I'm like,
that's cool.

1477
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:04.180
Oh really?
You know,
it's like,
I'm trying to think like,

1478
01:34:04.450 --> 01:34:07.960
but you've hung out with Eddie Murphy.
Yeah.
And I think that's,

1479
01:34:08.290 --> 01:34:10.870
that's pretty much the cool,
it really is.

1480
01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:13.690
Like when I met Obama,

1481
01:34:14.110 --> 01:34:18.570
I wasn't nervous because I'd met Eddie Murphy.
Do you know what I mean?
Like,
oh,

1482
01:34:19.170 --> 01:34:22.540
[inaudible] we're at Eddie's house like three years ago or something and a

1483
01:34:22.570 --> 01:34:25.260
shitty house.
Oh,
piece of shit.
Well,
the,

1484
01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:29.620
the first one went to his house was like 12 years ago.
And,
uh,

1485
01:34:29.730 --> 01:34:33.880
well we went to the,
we went to Bible Hill,
went to the Jersey one.
Uh,
I mean,

1486
01:34:33.881 --> 01:34:36.820
I literally,
I could just spend 20 minutes just talking about it.

1487
01:34:36.970 --> 01:34:38.020
Sometimes me and rock.

1488
01:34:38.021 --> 01:34:41.080
We'll just talk about how famous and Great Eddie Murphy was.

1489
01:34:41.230 --> 01:34:42.850
Dude for like chunks,

1490
01:34:42.851 --> 01:34:47.240
like where we'll just stop and be like anybody in our age range.
He is like,

1491
01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:51.970
like can't you?
So we were at Eddie Eddie's house and Eddie,

1492
01:34:52.570 --> 01:34:57.290
he's just smokes weed all the time.
Eddie does.
Yeah.
You,

1493
01:34:57.291 --> 01:34:59.240
I mean what do you,
he's got so much money.

1494
01:34:59.350 --> 01:35:04.350
He's so rich and he's so fucking funny and successful and he's also one of the,

1495
01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:11.930
it's very hard to legit pull off.
Very funny and cool.

1496
01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:17.050
Like mystique.
It doesn't,
but he does actually want to fuck them.

1497
01:35:17.051 --> 01:35:20.320
Right?
Cause maybe he's fun.
It's not even funny.

1498
01:35:20.321 --> 01:35:22.400
It's because I want to fuck is his essence.

1499
01:35:22.401 --> 01:35:25.540
I don't even care if he makes a joke when I started early too,
right.

1500
01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:29.590
He was like 1615 or something like he's a bit of a natural,

1501
01:35:30.110 --> 01:35:32.090
this is how much of a natural he is.
Charlie.

1502
01:35:32.230 --> 01:35:37.230
Only one time when they were like five they were watching TV and Eddie said I'm

1503
01:35:39.971 --> 01:35:43.750
going to be famous.
And Charlie said,
what's famous?

1504
01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:47.180
That's how fucking like,
yeah,
Destin.

1505
01:35:47.181 --> 01:35:52.181
It was another other greatest destiny is Murphy story is so a psychic,

1506
01:35:55.170 --> 01:36:00.070
uh,
one of the Murphy family went to a psychic,
oh,
sorry,

1507
01:36:00.071 --> 01:36:04.650
sorry,
sorry,
that was the mistake.
One of the,
um,
do you,
do I need to wait?
No,
no,

1508
01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:06.410
no,
no,
no,
no.
I was just one of the,
uh,

1509
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:11.470
one of the Murphy family in like the 60s went to a psychic and the psychic said

1510
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:16.520
someone in your bloodline is going to be world famous.

1511
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:22.030
So that generation of Murphy's all started taking tap dancing lessons,

1512
01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:27.210
singing lessons and like,
like acting class and all this shit.

1513
01:36:27.570 --> 01:36:31.660
And then one of their kids was at,
wow.
Yeah.
Like,

1514
01:36:31.730 --> 01:36:34.320
and then he was like,
and then it was like,
oh,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Like,

1515
01:36:34.530 --> 01:36:39.060
so he came out like,
like,
right.
Like he'd said,

1516
01:36:39.061 --> 01:36:41.720
watching TV.
He's like,
I'm going to be on there.
I'm going to be famous.
Does he,

1517
01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:45.560
does he still,
does he want to do movies still?
I don't feel like he did a,
he did.

1518
01:36:45.561 --> 01:36:48.800
Dolomite that's coming out.
That's coming in.
He's going to do,

1519
01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:53.870
coming to America too.
That's definitely a perfect comedy film.

1520
01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:57.080
Every time
I have to watch it,

1521
01:36:58.090 --> 01:36:59.600
just dumped it in 21 days.

1522
01:37:02.580 --> 01:37:07.540
So well written and so funny.
Every he's a setup or a punch,
you know.
Oh,

1523
01:37:07.710 --> 01:37:10.520
he,
the thing about Eddie is like,
he,

1524
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:14.030
the story that's the story goes like he may have written,

1525
01:37:14.031 --> 01:37:16.250
I'm going to get you sucker and was like,
I don't want to do it.

1526
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:19.880
They'll throw it away.
And Keenan was like,
oh,
I'll do this shit like that.

1527
01:37:19.881 --> 01:37:22.720
I don't know if that's true or not,
but um,
so the story I was going to tell,

1528
01:37:22.730 --> 01:37:26.780
but it was,
we're at Eddie's house and uh,
by the way,

1529
01:37:26.781 --> 01:37:30.680
he's such a Germaphobe,
everyone gets their own joint.
Oh.

1530
01:37:30.681 --> 01:37:32.960
So I don't smoke weed,
but like David is on joint.

1531
01:37:33.070 --> 01:37:37.430
Like you just get your own joint.
Um,
and uh,
and he was like,
yeah,
man.

1532
01:37:37.431 --> 01:37:39.920
Obama was real cool to me.
And uh,

1533
01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:43.670
and there's a picture of Obama meeting Eddie and Obama is like

1534
01:37:47.110 --> 01:37:51.110
his age.
Oh,
like Eddie Murphy,

1535
01:37:51.170 --> 01:37:54.590
Eddie Murphy.
You can't,
you can't,

1536
01:37:55.950 --> 01:38:00.810
how big and important he was.
Yeah.
You just can't,
like he's a,
he's a,

1537
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:05.850
he's a,
he's a titan.
Like a two and he was so relaxed.

1538
01:38:05.851 --> 01:38:07.670
What I loved about Eddie's,
so yes,

1539
01:38:08.050 --> 01:38:13.050
so comfortable at 20 years old or whenever he did the delirious had crazy trend

1540
01:38:15.810 --> 01:38:17.550
up that long.
Oh my God,

1541
01:38:17.670 --> 01:38:21.840
he's so relaxed and he's so calm and centered and he's having fun all the time.

1542
01:38:21.870 --> 01:38:23.300
Like he's in the old world.

1543
01:38:25.870 --> 01:38:30.300
You know when you're really in your groove in stand up,
you like you own it.

1544
01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:33.690
If you're on stage and you're like,
oh man,
like this set is tight.

1545
01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:36.140
Like people realize like you know this stuff and you're,

1546
01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:40.140
and to even think that somebody that could do it at 21 at that level,

1547
01:38:40.770 --> 01:38:43.620
why was the night at his house?
We were like,

1548
01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:47.940
me and Dave were just like fucking bug.
We were literally bugging him like,

1549
01:38:47.941 --> 01:38:51.240
come on Eddie,
do stand up.
It was literally like,
might as well again,
I'm like,

1550
01:38:51.241 --> 01:38:55.530
come on Mr. Come on Tuesday and a,
and I was asking him questions.
He's like,

1551
01:38:55.730 --> 01:38:58.550
you know how long you've known stand up.
And I was like,
ah,
like this.
Just like,

1552
01:38:59.130 --> 01:39:01.620
I guess four years ago,
I was like,
yeah,
it's seven years.
And it goes,
oh,

1553
01:39:01.621 --> 01:39:04.560
that's why you asked me all these fucking questions.
And he's like,

1554
01:39:04.561 --> 01:39:08.280
seven years I had done a delirious and I was like,
yeah,
but that's come on man.

1555
01:39:08.530 --> 01:39:12.090
Like that's not even,
that's not even seven years.

1556
01:39:12.650 --> 01:39:15.960
Not even a real can't judge.
No.

1557
01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:19.230
He might've done raw by at seven.
I don't even know.

1558
01:39:19.590 --> 01:39:23.550
Cause he was young.
I think he did.
Robin.
He's like 24 and 25.

1559
01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:26.580
So that would be set schools.
That's cool.
That'd be seven years.

1560
01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:31.000
It's one of those prodigies.
Yeah.
And he also,
here's the thing,

1561
01:39:31.290 --> 01:39:32.780
he's so affected.

1562
01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:37.200
Other standups that you can see somebody,

1563
01:39:38.130 --> 01:39:41.190
you could see Eddie now and be like,
oh,

1564
01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:44.730
I feel like I've seen a bunch of these jokes.
Yeah.
You saw hundreds of people.

1565
01:39:44.731 --> 01:39:49.620
All their version of all the offspring and bats bull and also prior.

1566
01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:53.880
I mean he's doing prior,
uh,

1567
01:39:53.881 --> 01:39:56.310
the Eddie Eddie's,

1568
01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:01.450

when a Cosby got sentenced,
um,

1569

Yeah.
Like,

1571
01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:16.530

Do you know what I mean?
Like,

1572
01:40:17.010 --> 01:40:20.220
And a rock to see a hero.
I,

1573
01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:22.410
I met bill Cosby again,

1574
01:40:22.411 --> 01:40:26.650

1577
01:40:37.470 --> 01:40:41.130
Everybody has ass fucking ass.
I never knew this shit.

1578
01:40:41.131 --> 01:40:44.610
Nobody fucking told me I knew it.
He literally was like,
and then the white man,

1579
01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:48.060

1583

And you're in there.

Dave's doing it.
Eddie did it.

1595

Keenan,

1597
01:42:04.131 --> 01:42:07.840
Caused me impression.

And then I was like,
and also,
uh,
nobody thought there was any pussy in it.

1599

Boy,
were we wrong?

1600
01:42:17.650 --> 01:42:22.310
How dare you?

first of all,
I knew blog that I'm writing.
I know.
Yay.
Yeah,

1601
01:42:22.730 --> 01:42:24.850
I saw you.
And that's how can we,

1602
01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:28.540
you know what I'm starting to realize like people can't take the way comedians

1603
01:42:28.541 --> 01:42:29.374
talk.

1604
01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:34.440
They literally can not like we make that joke and then it's a dummy goes,

1605
01:42:34.541 --> 01:42:38.980
are you advocating that bill cod?
There was no,

1606
01:42:38.990 --> 01:42:43.990
you fucking dumb ass meeting surgeons talk fucking medical the whole time.

1607
01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:47.530
Do you think they go like throw me the fucking ma,
whatever they call hearts,

1608
01:42:47.531 --> 01:42:51.220
whatever.
Yeah.
Yeah,
of course.
No,
he,
here's the thing too is like comics,

1609
01:42:51.221 --> 01:42:55.210
first of all,
people don't realize that if you're hanging out with comics,

1610
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:56.470
we try to push it.

1611
01:42:57.020 --> 01:43:02.020
So like we're trying to make another comic laugh and he would be upset like a

1612
01:43:02.621 --> 01:43:05.560
woman about a misogynistic joke if she's a comic,

1613
01:43:05.561 --> 01:43:06.760
should be like Miss Pretty funny joke.

1614
01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:10.950
We're still fuck the thing I said I'm Charlemagne show last week was like,

1615
01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:13.960
cause I'm a lieutenant of black culture.
You are

1616
01:43:16.170 --> 01:43:20.870
and see the got Lennart Lennart uh,
Charlotte Mckay.

1617
01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:25.750
There was a new one.
There's another new one.
Um,
but uh,
but yeah,

1618
01:43:25.751 --> 01:43:29.440
like people think that the thing I was saying,
tell me if you agree with this.

1619
01:43:29.860 --> 01:43:30.693
Your,

1620
01:43:30.990 --> 01:43:35.990
we're a yama comic before I'm a man or white man of course.

1621
01:43:37.060 --> 01:43:41.630
And that's,
yeah,
like I'm like you're a comic before you're a woman or as a calm.

1622
01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:46.450
The comic brain is above society norms.
It's above gender.
It's above race.

1623
01:43:46.451 --> 01:43:49.740
It's a bundle.
Yes.
Cause it hovers up here to unite all that.

1624
01:43:49.900 --> 01:43:51.350
And that's the thing that people don't understand.
It's like,

1625
01:43:51.351 --> 01:43:54.920
so if Louie says the n word,
he doesn't,

1626
01:43:55.010 --> 01:43:56.750
it's not even fucking,

1627
01:43:56.890 --> 01:43:59.860
<v 5>I liked the death thing about Louise saying that in that HBO thing,</v>

1628
01:44:00.130 --> 01:44:02.110
people were like,
uh,
this thing,
uh,

1629
01:44:02.410 --> 01:44:07.000
was unsurfaced like what are you on Hbo and Hbo?

1630
01:44:07.001 --> 01:44:10.900
And it was on youtube for a decade.
But that's regular people,

1631
01:44:11.150 --> 01:44:15.520
<v 18>man.
That's the thing.
They don't understand.
It's like,
like they,
it's not even,</v>

1632
01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:19.470
and it's just a thing like w like Chris is a black,
I don't know,

1633
01:44:20.530 --> 01:44:24.390
Chris and Dave aren't fucking,
I don't go hello black.
I go like,
oh,

1634
01:44:24.430 --> 01:44:28.630
it's a comedian calling me.
It's not a fucking black man put up meal,

1635
01:44:28.650 --> 01:44:33.340
putting her black man happy,
like it's just a fucking funny motherfucker.

1636
01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:35.220
<v 5>Um,
my,
uh,</v>

1637
01:44:35.340 --> 01:44:39.870
my first or one of the first times I heard somebody talk about Cosby being an

1638
01:44:39.910 --> 01:44:42.450
Asshole,
uh,
was a driver,

1639
01:44:42.570 --> 01:44:45.420
a cab or the car driver,
whatever,

1640
01:44:45.421 --> 01:44:49.470
this car service guide Indi years ago,
my first time doing crackers,

1641
01:44:50.010 --> 01:44:53.250
there's a driver picking an older black guy.
He's like,
it turns out he's like,

1642
01:44:53.251 --> 01:44:56.820
what's up man?
I was like,
hey.
And then we're driving.
And he's like,
well,

1643
01:44:56.830 --> 01:45:00.660
so what are you doing here?
And I go,
I'm,
I'm doing,
uh,
doing stand up.
He goes,

1644
01:45:00.661 --> 01:45:05.480
stand up.
I go,
yeah.
And he goes,
uh,
cause my fuck Steven.

1645
01:45:05.980 --> 01:45:10.980
I go off the top right off the top.
And he's like,
man,
he's an asshole.
He goes,

1646
01:45:11.050 --> 01:45:14.520
the fuck bill Cosby too.
And I go,
really?
He goes,
he's a piece of shit.

1647
01:45:14.521 --> 01:45:18.660
He was a fucking asshole when I,
he went on this whole story and I'm like,
oof.

1648
01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:23.400
And I go,
wow,
all right,
well,
uh,
hey man,
what's,
uh,
what's indie like?
And he goes,

1649
01:45:23.401 --> 01:45:25.860
ah,
you know,
murder.
He had murdered there and I was like,

1650
01:45:25.861 --> 01:45:29.970
that's your summary of this city.
And that was like,
that was all he gave me.

1651
01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:34.310
<v 18>The black guys talking hooks.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
The average black.</v>

1652
01:45:34.311 --> 01:45:37.460
Did you hear snoop announcing that?
The hockey?
No,

1653
01:45:37.490 --> 01:45:42.490
but announced a hockey game for 30 seconds last week and there's four hooks in

1654
01:45:43.911 --> 01:45:46.100
it.
Really?
It's fucking amazing.

1655
01:45:46.130 --> 01:45:49.970
Like I've said this on that the average black dude on the street is funnier than

1656
01:45:49.971 --> 01:45:54.080
me.
Average,
white middle.
Uh,
yeah.
Pretty true.

1657
01:45:54.650 --> 01:45:59.270
I put black ladies your head too.
Yes.
But uh,

1658
01:45:59.330 --> 01:46:03.830
but yeah,
like,
yeah,
so the guys still,
I've had cab drivers say shit.
Oh yeah.

1659
01:46:04.190 --> 01:46:07.370
Like I have kept her black cab driver in New York one time trying to say that

1660
01:46:07.371 --> 01:46:11.900
someone passed out and he goes and they get in the back.
They lock up.

1661
01:46:14.410 --> 01:46:17.220
And the funny God,
I think I know what he's saying.
I think too,

1662
01:46:17.221 --> 01:46:18.100
I wrote this thing statement

1663
01:46:18.190 --> 01:46:22.310
<v 5>time about how,
who,
if you,
if you had to hear a summary of what just happened,</v>

1664
01:46:22.490 --> 01:46:26.540
something notable happened and you missed it,
who would you rather hear?

1665
01:46:26.541 --> 01:46:30.700
If you have a choice or like an older white guy,
older,
uh,
or a,

1666
01:46:30.710 --> 01:46:34.640
an older black lady or a black guy or something like,
you know,
like 100% of the,

1667
01:46:34.750 --> 01:46:38.900
<v 18>there should be a news channel with
correspondence.</v>

1668
01:46:39.540 --> 01:46:43.150
That'd be such man,
Shit Open.

1669
01:46:43.151 --> 01:46:47.770
Every man had came in.
Yeah,
I want to hear that.
All right.
So,
um,

1670
01:46:48.010 --> 01:46:52.810
how much time we got?
Yeah.
All right.
Let me see if I can get this in.
Exactly.
Uh,

1671
01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:57.030
yeah.
So,
uh,
so,
so Eddie fucking is,

1672
01:46:57.070 --> 01:46:59.550
it's like an amazing dude and,
and uh,

1673
01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:04.700
it's crazy that you've hung out with like hug him the first time.

1674
01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:08.670
The second.
All right,
so the first time I went to his house,

1675
01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:13.800
I think the first time we showed him,
maybe we showed him Rick James.

1676
01:47:14.610 --> 01:47:19.170
I think that that would be true only because I feel like I've heard a story.

1677
01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:23.490
Dave talked about showing it,
showing them,
and I know,

1678
01:47:23.491 --> 01:47:27.630
but I don't know if that was the first thing,
but whatever.
So,
um,
we the second,

1679
01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:32.280
then,
then we went again,
like during a snow storm and me,

1680
01:47:32.281 --> 01:47:37.281
Dave and Charlie went and Dave went to smoke outside.

1681
01:47:37.770 --> 01:47:39.540
I think Charlie went to use the bathroom.

1682
01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:44.870
So I'm just in Eddie's kitchen in Jersey by myself eating soup like the k the

1683
01:47:48.210 --> 01:47:52.190
chef had left some soup,
you know,
rich people are.
Yeah.
And um,

1684
01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:56.580
and uh,
I'm eating soup and Eddie like comes in,

1685
01:47:56.610 --> 01:47:57.900
you know when you like enter room,

1686
01:47:57.901 --> 01:47:59.550
like you don't think anyone's going to be in there and like,
yeah,

1687
01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:04.290
like it's so he comes like kind of does one of those things like wearing a robe

1688
01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:08.430
and his wife Nicole at the time is with them and uh,
and I'm in,

1689
01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:12.090
I'm just eating soup and he's like,
Hey,
what's up?
He goes,
Hey Nicole,

1690
01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:15.150
did you meet Neil?
And I was just like,
how the fuck do you know mine?

1691
01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:19.050
Like it's fucking mind blowing that he even knows.

1692
01:48:19.110 --> 01:48:23.580
And now he'll like make a point of like,
oh Neil,
like it's crazy.

1693
01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:28.530
Even a here,
Pisa,
you say my name in Eddie Murphy.
Yeah,
of course is insane.

1694
01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:31.560
Just said he gets it right that he's not like,
yeah,
it'll fill up.
Yeah.
Like,

1695
01:48:31.561 --> 01:48:36.150
you know what I mean?
Brenner,
he knows who I am and like he knows,
uh,

1696
01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:37.680
I must,
I introduced,

1697
01:48:37.681 --> 01:48:42.150
did Tom tell you where I introduced him to Chris Rock all at the store,
right?

1698
01:48:42.151 --> 01:48:45.840
Yeah,
that was,
that was big deal for me,
honestly.
I'm sure.
And I've had like,

1699
01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:49.440
you know,
I would say like 99% of comics,
I'd be like,
what's up man?

1700
01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:53.130
I'm not a dick.
I'm just saying like,
yeah,
it would be fine.

1701
01:48:53.670 --> 01:48:57.150
But I definitely was thrown by that.
Yeah.
And I was like,
man,

1702
01:48:57.151 --> 01:49:02.080
this is Tom and Chris.
He was very nice,
but I still to me,
cause that,
you know,

1703
01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:05.580
your age has a lot to do with like who has an impact on you,

1704
01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:08.760
how old you were when they were,
yeah.
Yeah.
So like for me,

1705
01:49:09.190 --> 01:49:13.320
I'm a junior in high school and bring the pain comes out.

1706
01:49:14.070 --> 01:49:16.560
So you know,
it's before it's before Sam,
but it's also in the,

1707
01:49:16.570 --> 01:49:20.690
that 17 or something.
It kind of sets you up for,

1708
01:49:21.170 --> 01:49:25.420
for life.
You know,
like one of those big impact you can't get out.

1709
01:49:26.370 --> 01:49:29.430
He will never break that a hold over.
You never ever like,

1710
01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:34.050
you just can't not consent and say anything intelligent or funny to him.

1711
01:49:34.051 --> 01:49:38.950
I was like,
you do good stuff.
But it was like he'd seen your spa.

1712
01:49:38.970 --> 01:49:40.200
I mean that's the thing that was crazy.

1713
01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:43.570
I didn't even know he'd walk cause like he's like you got to cause a shift.

1714
01:49:43.590 --> 01:49:48.190
You've got a couple of,
I was like,
yeah I got a few.
Yeah.

1715
01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:54.650
Yeah.
I was like good.
You have,
you have a new one.
Yeah,
you're funny too.

1716
01:49:54.930 --> 01:49:55.631
And then Tom,

1717
01:49:55.631 --> 01:49:59.310
you know the like the cliff on the back of the car ran up the clinic.

1718
01:50:00.670 --> 01:50:02.890
He was so fucking jacked out.
Crazy though.

1719
01:50:02.891 --> 01:50:07.810
That those people influenced how you do and stand up and how you think comedy is

1720
01:50:08.230 --> 01:50:12.730
the fucking funny.
She's a child watching Eddie Murphy as a child.
I had one,

1721
01:50:12.731 --> 01:50:16.210
I did video of me,
I got to fucking put it up.

1722
01:50:16.780 --> 01:50:19.540
I got to find it.
But I've seen it semi recently,

1723
01:50:19.541 --> 01:50:24.541
so I know I have it of me doing standup in at the Improv in oh four oh five I

1724
01:50:27.041 --> 01:50:30.160
weigh like 60 pounds less than I weigh now.

1725
01:50:30.410 --> 01:50:34.750
So I looked like a skinny guy and I'm literally on stage and I'm going like this

1726
01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:38.560
and I'm like gesturing and and pacing and you're just like,
oh,

1727
01:50:38.561 --> 01:50:41.470
this is like a bad Chris rock impression.
You should put that up.

1728
01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:45.610
It's so fucking it.
Did you ever see Sebastian's first bought at the store?

1729
01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:49.570
It's on one of his DVDs.
It is,
yeah.

1730
01:50:49.870 --> 01:50:54.040
I don't know if it's on a,
I don't know if he put it on Youtube,

1731
01:50:54.310 --> 01:50:56.680
but the funny thing is not that different.

1732
01:50:57.300 --> 01:51:02.300
Like now it's kind of the same dude ideas of like what's been bothering.

1733
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:06.460
Yeah.
With roof,
car roof.
Why don't even know what the bits were about,

1734
01:51:06.461 --> 01:51:09.170
but like it's not even hidden.
Like,
yeah,

1735
01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:14.050
I remember people came up to me like I remember a woman came up to me after a

1736
01:51:14.051 --> 01:51:18.400
show and was like,
I didn't know you were so urban.
I was like,
what?
She's like,

1737
01:51:18.401 --> 01:51:22.270
Yup.
They're like,
ah,
like doing a Chris rock impression.
Yeah.

1738
01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:25.690
You know it's hard.
That's hard.
That's hard not to do.

1739
01:51:26.230 --> 01:51:29.440
Who are your people that,
yes.

1740
01:51:29.470 --> 01:51:33.040
I mean the thing is once you that'll,
that'll never leave your head.

1741
01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:34.510
Once you tell me that,

1742
01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:39.840
of course we're all doing kind of doing it because you're drawn to a lane,

1743
01:51:40.181 --> 01:51:44.890
right?
I forget who to talk to me.
You're drawn to somebody,
right?

1744
01:51:44.891 --> 01:51:46.570
It's that unconscious thing.

1745
01:51:47.110 --> 01:51:51.760
That's the archetype and I get what they're saying.
I see how they think.

1746
01:51:52.090 --> 01:51:56.470
Yeah.
I love Roseanne.
I loved Eddie Murphy.
I loved Richard Pryor.
Yeah.
Bill Hicks,

1747
01:51:56.830 --> 01:51:57.670
Hicks.
I can't,

1748
01:51:57.730 --> 01:52:02.730
I literally can't even watch him because I will just do him like I can't.

1749
01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:08.700
I can't watch it because I will start because once you see it,

1750
01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:13.390
then you can imagine them what it was like from their point of view.

1751
01:52:14.050 --> 01:52:17.110
And then you,
when you're on stage and then you have that point of view,

1752
01:52:17.710 --> 01:52:19.780
then you start thinking like them and it's like,

1753
01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:24.840
I think it's good that I never moved to New York because I 100% would have dove

1754
01:52:25.211 --> 01:52:28.780
even deeper than I did into doing a tell for example.
Everyone,

1755
01:52:29.050 --> 01:52:33.700
I mean everyone did it.
I just,
but I mean I have photos from like,

1756
01:52:34.210 --> 01:52:38.950
oh six oh seven or I'm wearing a black jacket and a black hat with my beard and

1757
01:52:38.951 --> 01:52:41.230
I'm smoking and I'm like,
what are you talking about?

1758
01:52:41.470 --> 01:52:44.980
Like it's fucking crazy thing is I was this,

1759
01:52:45.170 --> 01:52:48.860
I've known a tail since puberty.

1760
01:52:49.220 --> 01:52:54.160
My voice was changing and I modeled it after my brother and Intel.

1761
01:52:54.410 --> 01:52:58.600
Yeah.
Like my like kind of like,
well let's you know how when you're like,
Huh,

1762
01:52:58.601 --> 01:53:00.810
and you're kind of like,
you can kind of adjust it a little bit.

1763
01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:05.540
I model it after telling my brother like that's how fucking deep his,

1764
01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:09.230
his claws are.
Like I just did it before.

1765
01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:14.200
He still so he's fucking so goddamn bumping.
Mike's.
Yeah.

1766
01:53:14.310 --> 01:53:18.740
It's so ridiculous how hard it is to watch standup or it's your job.

1767
01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:22.820
Oh Man.
He turns me into a silly person.

1768
01:53:23.410 --> 01:53:25.610
He turns me into that person that just discovered,

1769
01:53:25.611 --> 01:53:30.020
discovered standup and loves it.
Like when I watched it,
I love this guy.

1770
01:53:30.050 --> 01:53:32.630
I made my girlfriend watch it when we were in Hong Kong.
I made them,

1771
01:53:32.810 --> 01:53:35.410
I made her watch this.
Have you met a girl there and made it an actual friend?

1772
01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:38.750
Girlfriends.
If you're going to make,
if we're going to make it in America,

1773
01:53:38.751 --> 01:53:42.520
you got to know what I'm about.
I know she came with,

1774
01:53:42.530 --> 01:53:45.960
but I made her watch a tells special from Oh,

1775
01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:48.800
the half hour from like 99 or whatever.

1776
01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:54.670
It's got the fucking 60 fucking great jokes in the row for the memories.

1777
01:53:55.070 --> 01:53:58.370
Yes.
It's the audio.
That's the audio.
Ah,

1778
01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:03.560
yeah.
And I think like people don't even realize like how,

1779
01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:09.020
how influential he was like f you can't,
it's crazy.

1780
01:54:09.290 --> 01:54:12.200
Puppies.
Puppies.
He,
you appease.

1781
01:54:16.900 --> 01:54:21.420
You're not going to like it.
Oh,
of come on my phone.

1782
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:23.720
I hate traveling.
Maybe it's,
cause when I was a kid,

1783
01:54:23.721 --> 01:54:27.880
my father used to be me with the globe.
I mean,
fucking perfect joke.
Yeah.

1784
01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:31.310
Yeah.
You mentioned this girlfriend.
Let's talk about it.

1785
01:54:31.970 --> 01:54:35.900
What's up with that tit situation?
She's a,

1786
01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:40.640
she's a Russian Gal.
She's in the fashion industry actually.
What she does,

1787
01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:45.700
she's models and uh,
by the way,
I have a,

1788
01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:49.430
a fart joke.
Text me those Becks.
I don't,

1789
01:54:50.420 --> 01:54:55.010
I don't like fart jokes,
but I feel like I want to write it down.

1790
01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:59.840
Hand it to you.
You,
I saw a clip of you farting on the air.

1791
01:54:59.900 --> 01:55:04.420
Yeah,
I regret it.
No,
no,
no supremacist.

1792
01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:08.120
I was just saying
it was such a,
it was fine.

1793
01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:10.910
It was like a good intro for it.
It was just like,
yeah,
if you're going to,

1794
01:55:10.911 --> 01:55:14.360
but I want to it,
I would have loved to Christen it with like a major fart.

1795
01:55:14.390 --> 01:55:18.440
Like you know Jordan Ruben?
Yeah.
He used it.
I don't know if he still does it.

1796
01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:21.860
He used to record all of his farts,
all of them,

1797
01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:27.040
and he would name them before he would m and send them to you.

1798
01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:32.360
So it'd be like hush puppies and then,

1799
01:55:32.361 --> 01:55:34.640
and they would have nothing to do with the fart.

1800
01:55:35.060 --> 01:55:37.100
Sometimes it'd be like loosely tangentially,

1801
01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:41.180
but he made a great observation about farts.
It's the ultimate Improv.

1802
01:55:42.410 --> 01:55:45.000
That's true.
You don't know what's going to come out.

1803
01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:48.600
You know something's coming out.
He's a funny guy and really funny.
Yeah,

1804
01:55:48.690 --> 01:55:52.920
see writing.
He's like dirt.
I don't know.
He's doing kind of weird horror movies.

1805
01:55:52.921 --> 01:55:54.780
I think we got off track with this girlfriend.

1806
01:55:55.170 --> 01:55:58.820
She like a 90 day fiance situation.
No,
she lives in.

1807
01:55:58.830 --> 01:56:00.720
She's looking at me like you love

1808
01:56:02.660 --> 01:56:07.390
pleadings spittle.
She learned how to speak English,
watching South Park.
Oh,

1809
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:09.331
Schumer was like,
oh.

1810
01:56:09.331 --> 01:56:14.331
So she was made in the lab to please you model like cool,

1811
01:56:14.850 --> 01:56:19.500
interesting,
funny,
better read than me.
How long you guys been together?

1812
01:56:19.650 --> 01:56:22.430
Like four months.
See,
that's the thing with you,
Neil,

1813
01:56:22.431 --> 01:56:25.260
is that you're very interesting.
You're highly intelligent.

1814
01:56:25.620 --> 01:56:30.050
I imagine that it's got to be hard for you to find a woman more because

1815
01:56:31.590 --> 01:56:32.730
women are fucking stupid.

1816
01:56:34.050 --> 01:56:38.570
It's more that it's not,
it's more my gut.

1817
01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:41.880
They have to keep up with my guy friends.
Do you know what I mean?

1818
01:56:41.881 --> 01:56:46.760
Like they have to keep up with
my girl.

1819
01:56:47.270 --> 01:56:51.480
My,
all of my friends are fucking hilarious and interesting.
Smart guys.

1820
01:56:51.481 --> 01:56:55.690
Funny guys.
Yeah,
they're all,
and the women are all swimming.
I was stoking.
Yeah.

1821
01:56:56.070 --> 01:56:57.540
Yeah.
And then like,
you know,

1822
01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:01.350
and then the women that I'm friends with are like Whitney Schumer,

1823
01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:05.700
Michelle Wolf be like fucking Ellen.

1824
01:57:06.030 --> 01:57:09.330
Like fucking funny mother.
Funny,
interesting.

1825
01:57:09.331 --> 01:57:11.940
I'm not like friend friends with Ellen,
but like,
yeah,
like,

1826
01:57:11.990 --> 01:57:14.010
like people that I talked to pretty,

1827
01:57:14.300 --> 01:57:19.170
so that's the bigger issue was like I'm a,
and now I'm,

1828
01:57:19.230 --> 01:57:22.080
um,
I just,
I was,

1829
01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:25.920
I was compromising a lot and now I'm like,
I,

1830
01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:31.080
if you want to come into my life,
here's what it is.
It's great,

1831
01:57:32.010 --> 01:57:35.640
it's successful.
I,
I like what I like,

1832
01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:38.940
I know why I don't like,
the things I don't like is great.

1833
01:57:38.941 --> 01:57:40.950
So if you want in,

1834
01:57:41.250 --> 01:57:45.150
here's how it's going to be and if you are not,

1835
01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:49.560
then I have,
I'm not compromising cause I'd rather be alone.

1836
01:57:49.950 --> 01:57:54.610
The rewards of a partner are not worth the cost a lot of the time.
That's,

1837
01:57:54.760 --> 01:57:59.220
that's very insightful.
I think that only comes for most people with time,

1838
01:57:59.221 --> 01:58:00.054
with age,

1839
01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:04.110
like sometimes you meet that rare person who has that perspective young and

1840
01:58:04.111 --> 01:58:07.050
you're like,
what the f how does it,
how the fuck did you do it like this.

1841
01:58:07.290 --> 01:58:09.840
But the truth is that you know,

1842
01:58:09.870 --> 01:58:14.610
if you are in your late thirties early forties you really become,

1843
01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:19.340
you know who you are.
Yeah.
I feel like a lot of life is like this.
Yeah.

1844
01:58:19.630 --> 01:58:22.890
That and then finally just like this,
I'm this and then here's the thing,

1845
01:58:22.891 --> 01:58:27.060
you are being honest about it,
which is the best thing.
And I don't know,

1846
01:58:27.510 --> 01:58:30.630
I'm not a piece of shit.
Like I'm not,
I just don't like,

1847
01:58:30.660 --> 01:58:33.750
and I say to my girlfriend,
I'm like,
so you're not mad at me.
And she's like,
no,

1848
01:58:33.751 --> 01:58:36.780
why would I be mad at you?
And I'm like every girlfriend I've ever had,

1849
01:58:36.781 --> 01:58:40.890
it's just mad at me all the time.
She's Russian,
so cold.
So she goes from,

1850
01:58:41.500 --> 01:58:46.210
Oh Jesus Christ.
Imagine the animals that like that as like,
are you mad at me?

1851
01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:48.180
No,
I cheese.

1852
01:58:48.190 --> 01:58:52.680
Like I've never had a boyfriend even asked me if I feel anything.

1853
01:58:52.700 --> 01:58:57.700
She did one thing that was like a fucked up and I was like,

1854
01:58:58.170 --> 01:59:01.450
all right,
well we're going to break up.
And she just started crying and was like,

1855
01:59:01.451 --> 01:59:04.580
I'm sorry.
I will never do that again.
Yeah.
Playing.
It wasn't like even that far.

1856
01:59:04.581 --> 01:59:09.220
It was just like she made a scene about some dumb shit and then was like,

1857
01:59:09.250 --> 01:59:13.090
oh I need,
she had told me she had like really bad.
You know why she did that?

1858
01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:15.430
I'll tell you what's up on my Instagram.
They heads,

1859
01:59:15.431 --> 01:59:18.830
I'm on a roll today because women are fucking stupid.
You Go,

1860
01:59:19.060 --> 01:59:20.680
I like the idea of that at two lengths.

1861
01:59:23.540 --> 01:59:28.000
<v 0>That's right.
Cause that's my tribe.
So I'm Hungarian.</v>

1862
01:59:28.001 --> 01:59:29.680
But then we're a Russian adjacent.

1863
01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:34.180
It's a very harsh culture and we don't do well with vulnerability.
Uh,

1864
01:59:34.210 --> 01:59:38.110
my parents used to resent it when waiters would call them folks like,
hey faults,

1865
01:59:38.111 --> 01:59:43.111
I bought these folks and they see kindness as weakness or Zelaya that smiling.

1866
01:59:44.350 --> 01:59:48.100
They think Americans are donkeys cause we're constantly like,
hi,
how are you?

1867
01:59:48.101 --> 01:59:52.990
Like they really hate it.
Yeah.
But you like this,
uh,
she,
she liked that with you.

1868
01:59:52.991 --> 01:59:56.960
I'm saying no,
she's not marring sweet.
She's silly and sweet.

1869
01:59:56.970 --> 02:00:01.740
And now were you,
you were on Paul Gilmartin's mental illness.
Yeah.

1870
02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:04.540
I know I listened to your episode.
This is a while ago,
so I'm trying to,

1871
02:00:04.990 --> 02:00:07.500
you came from a family of like 20 children.
Okay.
And

1872
02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:11.400
<v 18>children.
Yeah.
That's really crazy.
It's really crazy.
Yeah.
No,
we're number 10.</v>

1873
02:00:11.550 --> 02:00:15.960
Yeah.
God Damn.
It's crazy.
Uh,
and uh,
yeah,

1874
02:00:15.961 --> 02:00:18.000
10 kids.
It's like growing up in a,

1875
02:00:18.780 --> 02:00:22.500
in a fucking like orphanage,

1876
02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:25.410
you have to get lost in the house of 10 kits.
Yeah.

1877
02:00:25.411 --> 02:00:28.650
I was lucky because as the youngest you get like extra,

1878
02:00:28.710 --> 02:00:33.540
like everyone's number six.
No,
I mean five.
Yeah.

1879
02:00:33.541 --> 02:00:38.310
They're like,
yeah,
it's,
it's like,
it's a mixed bag in terms of like who,

1880
02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:42.780
who,
uh,
who succeeded.
But like,
who was,

1881
02:00:43.380 --> 02:00:48.210
it's more generational.
Like I'm from a generation of like,
I went to therapy,

1882
02:00:48.211 --> 02:00:50.340
I take medication.
I'm like,
right.

1883
02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:53.340
I think mental level is like an actual thing.

1884
02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:58.580
Whereas the older family is like,
no,
you don't.
We don't do them.
Right.

1885
02:00:58.620 --> 02:01:03.570
Like we're from like,
you got it out.
Fucking should suffer.

1886
02:01:03.650 --> 02:01:07.500
Yeah.
Always suffering.
And that's what light.
That's a,

1887
02:01:07.501 --> 02:01:12.300
that's Catholicism and B,
that's like life at large.

1888
02:01:12.330 --> 02:01:15.690
That's what,
that's what it is.
Like what are you doing?
Like what are you,

1889
02:01:16.110 --> 02:01:18.090
what are you a fag?
Like that's the thing of like,

1890
02:01:18.091 --> 02:01:21.150
what are you fucking taking kit?
Like what do you like my,

1891
02:01:21.330 --> 02:01:25.830
I've been on Zoloft or something for like 20 years and I have a brother that's

1892
02:01:25.831 --> 02:01:30.000
constantly like,
so are you going to keep taking it?
That thing that's working,

1893
02:01:30.001 --> 02:01:34.800
that's the thing that's working for you,
that like your life's half over.
Like,

1894
02:01:34.801 --> 02:01:38.670
yeah,
I'm going to keep Tate like,
but they still see it as like,

1895
02:01:39.500 --> 02:01:43.250
I don't know if the word sin is the right word,
but it's like in there,

1896
02:01:43.630 --> 02:01:48.410
in that kind of tinkering with God's plan for you.
Wonderful.

1897
02:01:48.411 --> 02:01:52.880
Syring plan wanted you to be anxious.
Yeah.
Right.
Yes.
Anxiety,

1898
02:01:52.881 --> 02:01:57.730
depression,
panic attacks.
But why don't you let God do his thing,
Bro.
Yeah.

1899
02:01:57.810 --> 02:01:59.270
That's interesting because I think like you said,

1900
02:01:59.271 --> 02:02:03.290
a lot of people kind of live with a low grade suffering and that's like a low

1901
02:02:03.291 --> 02:02:06.050
grade depression.
And if they're older they think like

1902
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:10.400
I love your new joke about your mom,

1903
02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:14.000
like your dry cause I never cause it's a,

1904
02:02:14.001 --> 02:02:17.780
it's not really like the rest of your jokes I've seen.
And B,

1905
02:02:17.810 --> 02:02:21.830
I love when people are like,
these people are fucking maniacs.

1906
02:02:22.760 --> 02:02:27.200
Parents are fucking,
these parents are maniacs.
A lot of the time it's true.

1907
02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:30.200
It's true.
You just realize it.
I mean I,
it's,
it's not,

1908
02:02:30.410 --> 02:02:33.440
and when you have an adult relationship with them,
right,
they hate it.

1909
02:02:33.441 --> 02:02:36.120
And when you,
when you'd be having an adult relationship,
you realize to you,

1910
02:02:36.130 --> 02:02:38.390
you start to,
you get that clear.
Especially when you have kids,
you're like,

1911
02:02:38.750 --> 02:02:42.920
oh two people,
just two random people just fucking made me.
Yeah.

1912
02:02:44.030 --> 02:02:47.000
Yeah.
They're not anointed.
Yeah.
It's just like you see it,
you know,

1913
02:02:47.001 --> 02:02:48.560
you saw someone will walk by earlier,

1914
02:02:48.980 --> 02:02:51.780
like that person could have been the person.
Yeah.
Like,

1915
02:02:52.150 --> 02:02:54.710
and when you have that realization,
you're like,
this is pretty wild.

1916
02:02:54.860 --> 02:02:59.120
Like it's just a random lady,
you know?
I mean like,
like I don't,

1917
02:02:59.150 --> 02:03:02.330
I mean I'm cool with my mom,
but there's still no,
but it's still,

1918
02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:06.890
you have tension.
Yeah.
That's legitimate on both of your parts.

1919
02:03:06.891 --> 02:03:11.160
Circumstances are fucking wild.
Like,
my mom,
you know,

1920
02:03:11.380 --> 02:03:14.090
immigrated to this country at like 31.
I mean,

1921
02:03:14.300 --> 02:03:18.290
she's like never in a million years thought that she was going to live here

1922
02:03:19.130 --> 02:03:23.870
ever.
Like my mom is my mom's,
my dad's one of 13.

1923
02:03:23.930 --> 02:03:28.370
Oh my fire.
His parents were Irish immigrants.
Like his,

1924
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:33.560
his dad was like,
uh,
like elevator,
like I don't fucking,

1925
02:03:33.561 --> 02:03:38.390
just some blue collar.
My Dad was born in 1930.
He like seeing the,

1926
02:03:38.391 --> 02:03:42.950
like the height of the regimen and it support like your dad still around.
No,
no.

1927
02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:46.480
Um,
and uh,
so like,
yeah,
they,

1928
02:03:46.770 --> 02:03:50.820
there were like living in outer space from,
from what their life is like.

1929
02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:55.070
And so even so,
my mom actually kind of said like,

1930
02:03:55.340 --> 02:03:58.880
you got to give it a rest with this accountability shit.

1931
02:03:59.180 --> 02:04:01.910
She didn't say that exactly,
but it was sort of like,

1932
02:04:02.810 --> 02:04:07.340
I was kind of taking her to task for Shit and she was Kinda like,
look dude,

1933
02:04:07.370 --> 02:04:09.000
I'm fucking 84.

1934
02:04:11.940 --> 02:04:16.730
You got to like,
you just got to like,
are you going to do this?
Right,

1935
02:04:16.731 --> 02:04:19.460
right,
right.
You're going to stay on this just to like die.

1936
02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:21.680
Like what is that your plan like you have to,

1937
02:04:21.681 --> 02:04:26.330
which is coming up by that I mean by the way,
like trust me,
uh,
she,

1938
02:04:26.331 --> 02:04:29.600
I have a bunch of fucking jokes and she came to my show and it was like,

1939
02:04:29.630 --> 02:04:33.300
I'm literally fuck the stool and I'm just like my mom,
I don't know what to,

1940
02:04:33.610 --> 02:04:38.280
Oh my God,
I can't leave him plugged it.
So Neil is,
uh,
that's a new

1941
02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:42.510
<v 4>one on Netflix,
comedians of the world,
which came out January 1st,</v>

1942
02:04:42.511 --> 02:04:47.280
I believe it was.
And the American comics featured on it are uh,

1943
02:04:47.410 --> 02:04:51.000
for me the way it was Swartz Swartz in Nicole Byer so,

1944
02:04:51.001 --> 02:04:52.940
and then there's couch from other countries but we don't really sell it.

1945
02:04:53.610 --> 02:04:54.650
But the Americans,

1946
02:04:57.630 --> 02:05:02.000
I mean I,
I I to me it's,
you know,
when you have like a good batch yeah.

1947
02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:05.640
To I think it's a good batch and it was still in Montreal.
Yes.
Montreal,

1948
02:05:05.641 --> 02:05:10.170
thanks for spelling it specials.
You have your three Mikes,

1949
02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:14.660
which was a big hit.
Yes.
A lot of people really,
really like,
oh yeah.
That was,

1950
02:05:15.260 --> 02:05:16.110
that was there was like,

1951
02:05:16.540 --> 02:05:18.870
<v 18>that was when I stopped being Dave's buddy.
Right.</v>

1952
02:05:19.740 --> 02:05:22.160
This the first time people are like,
oh good,
you do your own thing.

1953
02:05:22.770 --> 02:05:25.820
But you had another one before that I had one for calming central called Women

1954
02:05:25.821 --> 02:05:28.970
in black suits,
women in black dudes.
Um,
which uh,

1955
02:05:29.180 --> 02:05:31.760
made it sound like some weird white supremacy thing.
It was just,

1956
02:05:31.970 --> 02:05:33.260
that's what the jokes were about.

1957
02:05:33.410 --> 02:05:37.070
I remember it's like being in high school and seeing like,
um,

1958
02:05:37.190 --> 02:05:41.240
like watching drama or something from upperclassmen.
You announced,

1959
02:05:41.450 --> 02:05:42.620
I think on social media,

1960
02:05:43.050 --> 02:05:44.960
your specials coming out is called women and black dudes.

1961
02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:49.130
And the Chris Rock rock is like,
I thought you had a chance,

1962
02:05:49.930 --> 02:05:54.020
but that's a disease,
like don't title it.
And I was like,
look man,

1963
02:05:54.050 --> 02:05:57.410
I called it that.
But for some reason I feel like I'm reading a text.
I was like,

1964
02:05:57.450 --> 02:06:01.630
oh,
he,
oh,
he's the funniest motherfucker.

1965
02:06:01.910 --> 02:06:05.570
Like yeah,
he said the meanest thing anyone's ever said and it's so fucking,

1966
02:06:05.630 --> 02:06:08.750
again,
this is like,
you couldn't be a part of it.

1967
02:06:08.780 --> 02:06:11.660
This would hurt your feelings too much.
Normal person.
Right.

1968
02:06:11.661 --> 02:06:14.930
So at the three mikes premiere,
whatever,

1969
02:06:14.931 --> 02:06:19.790
like the Broadway theater opening thing or off Broadway,
um,

1970
02:06:19.880 --> 02:06:23.320
Eh,
Eh,
uh,
um,

1971
02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:25.970
Chapelle in the audience,

1972
02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:30.320
it was a John Legend and Chrissy Tiegen.

1973
02:06:30.321 --> 02:06:33.380
John was the producer.
They,
I,
they're just my friends.
I love the grace

1974
02:06:34.090 --> 02:06:34.923
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

1975
02:06:35.620 --> 02:06:40.500
<v 18>uh,
Seth Myers,
Trevor Noah,
and you're like,
all right,
I'm getting a little tight.</v>

1976
02:06:41.130 --> 02:06:45.720
Chris Rock,
Dave Chappelle.
Oh my God.
So like Queen Chrissy posted that.

1977
02:06:45.990 --> 02:06:47.910
She watched my special the other day.
Oh,
did she,

1978
02:06:49.390 --> 02:06:52.350
did she say anything that she said?
Oh,
she was laughing a lot.

1979
02:06:52.520 --> 02:06:55.530
Are we going to talk about the Brad Pitt thing?
The Brad Pitt thing?

1980
02:06:56.820 --> 02:06:59.760
Do you know about the Brad Pitt thing?
No.
Yeah,
you do.
I heard

1981
02:07:00.150 --> 02:07:04.350
<v 4>Adam told you,
told you.
Oh,
how do you know that?
Because I,</v>

1982
02:07:04.351 --> 02:07:08.670
it wasn't just you dick face,
it was me.
I'm just,
I don't know.
I'm asking.

1983
02:07:08.671 --> 02:07:13.320
I don't know.
I don't know the story.
How did you hear
his story?
I don't.

1984
02:07:13.380 --> 02:07:14.790
All I know is what you know.

1985
02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:19.900
Brad Pitt said that his favorite comics right now are me,
Tom.
Oh,
hey.

1986
02:07:20.010 --> 02:07:22.890
Jim Jefferies and helper don't see.
That's the thing.

1987
02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:24.150
So when you say the Brad Pitt thing,

1988
02:07:24.151 --> 02:07:27.900
I'm like Brad Pitt thing and then he didn't tell me anybody else.
Oh yeah.

1989
02:07:27.901 --> 02:07:29.480
He just goes,
Brad Pitt's setting.

1990
02:07:29.550 --> 02:07:33.360
Do you feel like less important now because you're one of four?
Well,

1991
02:07:33.540 --> 02:07:35.680
here's the thing.
You want to know who the are

1992
02:07:36.190 --> 02:07:39.000
<v 18>and they buy all those photos for.
I'm like,
that's good.
That's good.</v>

1993
02:07:39.690 --> 02:07:42.550
It's got good.
If he had,
if he had said a few other names that might be like,

1994
02:07:42.551 --> 02:07:45.070
well,
fuck yeah,
no,
trust me that have people go,

1995
02:07:45.071 --> 02:07:49.610
I love Chappelle show and battlebots.
Alright man,

1996
02:07:49.970 --> 02:07:52.900
that's a good list.
So at the premiere,

1997
02:07:53.610 --> 02:07:54.600
<v 5>uh,</v>

1998
02:07:54.980 --> 02:07:58.940
<v 18>me and Dave and Chris get our picture taken in front of the stepper.
Pete,</v>

1999
02:08:00.270 --> 02:08:03.330
<v 5>we walk away and the publicity goes,
Neil,</v>

2000
02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:07.890
the photographers want a picture of you by yourself and rock looks at me and
goes

2001
02:08:08.040 --> 02:08:12.930
<v 18>for the first time in your life.
Oh Wow.
And you're like,
ah.
It's like,</v>

2002
02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:17.430
you're so mean.
But also,
yeah.
Yeah.
That's funny.
It's funny.

2003
02:08:17.431 --> 02:08:20.780
It's funny.
And it's also funny considering the company,
right?
I mean it's,
yeah,

2004
02:08:20.790 --> 02:08:24.520
it's great.
It's all works,
but it's very like you,
you that would make a,

2005
02:08:24.630 --> 02:08:29.490
that could make you cry.
Yeah.
The wrong hands.
Yeah,
of course.
Yeah.
No,

2006
02:08:29.491 --> 02:08:34.020
I like my sister's
like,
yeah,
that wouldn't,

2007
02:08:34.021 --> 02:08:38.040
they wouldn't enjoy that.
Especially someone you respect.
Um,

2008
02:08:38.100 --> 02:08:40.200
so I didn't even tell you that.

2009
02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:43.060
<v 5>We obviously did not go through all of this correctly,</v>

2010
02:08:43.061 --> 02:08:48.060
but just for you asked me about who is Randy and I just realized that that's

2011
02:08:50.050 --> 02:08:51.660
who is Randy.
Um,

2012
02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:56.830
real sports has done a lot of features on CTE and the uh,
um,

2013
02:08:56.980 --> 02:08:59.860
how football really does serious brain damage.

2014
02:09:00.310 --> 02:09:02.020
One of the early times they profiled it,

2015
02:09:02.230 --> 02:09:05.080
they got a group of guys together who are all suffering from it with their

2016
02:09:05.081 --> 02:09:10.081
spouses and the interviewer talk to John Mackey Hall of fame tied in for the

2017
02:09:12.251 --> 02:09:16.930
Baltimore Colts and his wife and at the time a Mackie,

2018
02:09:16.990 --> 02:09:21.990
he's got on his cowboy hat sunglasses and he is pretty like pretty far along and

2019
02:09:22.811 --> 02:09:24.780
he,
you know,
he can't be alone and stuff and,

2020
02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:28.120
and she's talking to the interviewer like I am to you.

2021
02:09:28.150 --> 02:09:31.570
He's sitting right next to where it just kind of like looking around like not

2022
02:09:31.571 --> 02:09:36.190
really keyed into the conversation.
So he's like,
what's Day?
Like she's like,
well,

2023
02:09:36.910 --> 02:09:40.190
he's always like,
when are we going to go?
Like we're about to go somewhere.
Yeah,

2024
02:09:40.450 --> 02:09:44.800
she goes,
I've had to make up things to placate him.

2025
02:09:44.890 --> 02:09:47.500
So I just tell him that the,
uh,

2026
02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:51.270
like when he says that I just go all the cars in the shop right now and I tell

2027
02:09:51.271 --> 02:09:53.470
him that there's a,
a mechanic,

2028
02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:58.830
a made up mechanic named Randy who is working on it and then it just kind of

2029
02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:03.760
satisfies him for a while and then the interviewer tries to get in on it and

2030
02:10:03.761 --> 02:10:07.770
he's like,
ah,
John.
Um,
is is your,

2031
02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:11.550
is Randy working on your car right now?
Is that what he's doing?
And,

2032
02:10:11.630 --> 02:10:16.060
and John Mackey goes,
who was Randy.
That's it.
Yeah.
Great.

2033
02:10:16.660 --> 02:10:20.010
Totally worth it.
Because what happened was,
again,
uh,

2034
02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:24.190
with that one sickler and I used to just like talk to each other on the phone

2035
02:10:24.191 --> 02:10:28.670
and be like,
who is handy and just say it back and forth through it in there.
Yup.

2036
02:10:29.050 --> 02:10:33.800
Um,
the real sports,
one of the greatest shows ever.
Yeah.

2037
02:10:34.380 --> 02:10:37.500
<v 4>I don't like the handicap stories.</v>

2038
02:10:38.030 --> 02:10:42.410
<v 18>I don't like,
I don't like,
I gotta be honest.
I like,
I love the,</v>

2039
02:10:42.500 --> 02:10:45.300
I love the,
the,
the investigative stuff.
I love,

2040
02:10:45.530 --> 02:10:50.360
I love CTE cause it's investigative.
I don't like candles or gay.
Those are great.

2041
02:10:50.361 --> 02:10:51.630
FIFA drug tests.

2042
02:10:51.690 --> 02:10:55.940
All he do like they do iron mate.

2043
02:10:55.941 --> 02:11:00.800
He carries him during the iron man.
I'm like,
I can't.
I like,

2044
02:11:00.830 --> 02:11:04.700
I'm sorry.
ESPN light.
Yeah,
he's six.
He gives a shit.

2045
02:11:05.180 --> 02:11:09.950
We call that white bummers white people bombers being bombed out,

2046
02:11:09.951 --> 02:11:14.951
which is why they like really serious movies and they answer movies or damn or

2047
02:11:15.150 --> 02:11:19.760
shit like,
yeah.
Why do white people love bummer Stilwell?
You know?

2048
02:11:19.761 --> 02:11:24.761
Because there's novelty to it because we have such nice lives.

2049
02:11:26.180 --> 02:11:31.130
It's the same reason we like,
we like a peeking into a shitty resume.

2050
02:11:32.850 --> 02:11:36.860
It's tourism so it's like the same reason they like hip hop.
It's like wait,

2051
02:11:36.890 --> 02:11:40.610
what he did now what the fellas said,
what

2052
02:11:42.460 --> 02:11:45.890
can make the pussy trip?
He focus oil boy,

2053
02:11:46.850 --> 02:11:51.830
same reason we do extreme sports like Parco I've been doing a drug of a park

2054
02:11:51.850 --> 02:11:55.790
core.
Why couldn't you just try to walk hotel?

2055
02:11:55.950 --> 02:11:58.000
You're right from place to place.

2056
02:11:58.430 --> 02:12:03.410
White kids are doing flips off bill that like white guys can't run up walls and

2057
02:12:03.411 --> 02:12:06.320
the cops be like fantastic.
Ooh,

2058
02:12:06.990 --> 02:12:11.180
good one off of his parking garage.
That's great.
Fantastic.

2059
02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:15.290
<v 4>Been in hotels like in the morning when you're going to check out in like 20</v>

2060
02:12:15.291 --> 02:12:20.291
minutes and just put on like turn on the TV land on ESPN and there'll be like,

2061
02:12:23.090 --> 02:12:27.500
he just wanted to meet Jj Watt.
Oh,

2062
02:12:27.770 --> 02:12:32.770
And like five minute piece on a kid that wants to meet his hero and I'll fucking

2063
02:12:34.460 --> 02:12:37.310
ball on the edge of the bed and then I'll be like,

2064
02:12:37.370 --> 02:12:40.240
I gotta get the Fuck Outta here man.
Like I gotta get out of this one,

2065
02:12:40.580 --> 02:12:45.290
but I can't watch that shit.
Yeah,
it's just too much.

2066
02:12:45.380 --> 02:12:49.670
It's also,
there's something,
well,
we need to stop that one,
my man.

2067
02:12:50.030 --> 02:12:52.820
What's going on?
Is it that complicated

2068
02:12:54.230 --> 02:12:58.810
<v 18>there bitch?
God Damn.
Okay fucking hate myself.</v>

2069
02:13:00.130 --> 02:13:04.960
You know what you're doing to the quote JC,
you,
you made it a hot line.

2070
02:13:05.170 --> 02:13:08.980
You pick a hotline,
you making a hot song.
There you go,
man.
You know what I mean?

2071
02:13:08.981 --> 02:13:12.720
If they,
if people come at you say,
you know you made it a hotline,

2072
02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:14.710
I made it a hot song.
There you go.
Yeah,
yeah.

2073
02:13:15.330 --> 02:13:17.640
You know what I'm going to do about a man?
What's the fuck you even talk,

2074
02:13:17.690 --> 02:13:22.570
what are we even talking to?
You know,
Jay Z,
I work with them last year on a,

2075
02:13:22.571 --> 02:13:26.230
uh,
uh,
for his wreck for his album,

2076
02:13:27.130 --> 02:13:29.890
the four for four album with the Oj song and all that stuff I wore,

2077
02:13:29.891 --> 02:13:34.710
I made like a documentary about kind of just black dudes.
Yeah.

2078
02:13:35.220 --> 02:13:39.750
And Neil's the guy.
Yeah.
I don't,
they wanted,
I was low on the list,

2079
02:13:39.751 --> 02:13:42.060
but like,
yeah,
I'm on the list.
So,
uh,

2080
02:13:42.450 --> 02:13:47.450
so he played me the album in his studio and I don't know if you've ever been to

2081
02:13:47.701 --> 02:13:52.650
Jay Jay's studio or any hip hop studio?
Uh,
no,
I don't think,
no.

2082
02:13:52.651 --> 02:13:54.690
He's um,
he,

2083
02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:59.720
any hip hop studio eat is so fucking loud that it's like,

2084
02:14:00.390 --> 02:14:04.500
guys,
do you kind of want to go guys,
you can't get problems guys.

2085
02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:08.700
Like I'm not,
come on.
That's how loud they play it.
They play.
Yes.

2086
02:14:08.730 --> 02:14:12.350
And I've been in,
I've been in ones where I had to leave,
like,

2087
02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:15.510
where I'm just like,
oh,
I'm not going to do this.
I've covered my,
like,

2088
02:14:15.511 --> 02:14:19.920
I'll just do whatever.
And,
uh,
and I made him turn it down.
You did?
Yeah.

2089
02:14:20.130 --> 02:14:23.080
You're cute.
Turn that down a little bit.
Yeah.
Wow.
It's just too loud on the,

2090
02:14:23.081 --> 02:14:27.720
were you in bed?
Were you afraid?
No,
cause it's just like cracker ass.
He is like,

2091
02:14:27.721 --> 02:14:30.240
I couldn't the Dutchman,

2092
02:14:30.300 --> 02:14:34.080
the Dutchman and came and

2093
02:14:35.750 --> 02:14:39.630
um,
and uh,
played the record and then I like,
uh,

2094
02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:43.410
and then so he plays it for you and laid me the record.
And then Chi,

2095
02:14:43.500 --> 02:14:44.850
it was always very vague.

2096
02:14:44.851 --> 02:14:48.930
And then basically I ended up like interviewing a bunch of,

2097
02:14:49.500 --> 02:14:52.440
uh,
black boots about the themes of the record.

2098
02:14:52.950 --> 02:14:57.200
But it was like I interviewed this about maturing and charity and like,
and,

2099
02:14:57.201 --> 02:14:58.680
and cheating and knowledge.

2100
02:14:58.681 --> 02:15:03.681
It's so interview Jay Interviewed Will Smith interviewed rock interviewed,

2101
02:15:03.780 --> 02:15:07.030
uh,
my Herschel Holly,

2102
02:15:07.550 --> 02:15:12.150
I would call that top notch blacks.
Yes.
Then the tops the top blacks.

2103
02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:16.540
Uh,
and uh,
it was,
it was great like,

2104
02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:19.860
but it's only on title,
so I think there's like a shitty version on youtube.

2105
02:15:19.861 --> 02:15:23.490
Did you even consider for a second doing a joke where like the album ends and

2106
02:15:23.491 --> 02:15:25.290
you're like,
how do you [inaudible] this is some bullshit.

2107
02:15:26.070 --> 02:15:29.670
I'm just fucking around.
That's great.
Um,
uh,
he did,

2108
02:15:29.671 --> 02:15:32.070
he played me the Oj song and I was like,

2109
02:15:32.071 --> 02:15:34.770
I can't wait to see you do that on Carpool Karaoke.

2110
02:15:35.270 --> 02:15:39.510
It's probably cause it just says the and went over number.
Um,
but uh,
but yeah,

2111
02:15:39.511 --> 02:15:43.590
so I know him a little bit,
but like it was,
that was like a professional thing.

2112
02:15:43.591 --> 02:15:46.500
Like personally,
it's super famous,

2113
02:15:46.501 --> 02:15:50.820
talented black superstar like type person who you haven't met.

2114
02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:54.630
That's really the game.
I feel like,
you know,
I'm all,
or Kelly,

2115
02:15:54.631 --> 02:15:58.140
did you meet her Kelly?
No,
but I,
I,

2116
02:15:58.141 --> 02:16:03.141
you know what's funny about that r Kelly documentary is that most of us thanks,

2117
02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:07.890
um,
is,
uh,
ever even the women that he like abuse,

2118
02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:10.500
like he locked her in a safe

2119
02:16:12.150 --> 02:16:15.930
for four days.
They all say he sang like an angel.

2120
02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:20.660
Every single one o said they sang every single one of them.

2121
02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:21.870
Everyone said the same thing.

2122
02:16:22.230 --> 02:16:27.230
Sang like an angel one couldn't read well crazy,

2123
02:16:27.690 --> 02:16:30.280
every single part II.
The that didn't need to set up,

2124
02:16:30.300 --> 02:16:33.220
couldn't read well they would keep it at the dock or not.
I haven't watched it.

2125
02:16:33.230 --> 02:16:35.630
We have it by watched it.
Um,

2126
02:16:36.070 --> 02:16:39.580
but I remember reading the Chicago Sun Times peas,
like the big writer,

2127
02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:43.660
then the expo's a few years ago and it always stuck with me and they said that

2128
02:16:43.661 --> 02:16:46.300
he was known to be,

2129
02:16:46.660 --> 02:16:51.660
to go long periods of time unpaid camped and he would show up with like stained,

2130
02:16:53.260 --> 02:16:57.910
you know,
sweat pants and like just mad hair and stunk and like,

2131
02:16:57.911 --> 02:17:00.640
that's how he would go out like that all the time.

2132
02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:06.150
That's almost like a handicap in yourself.
Like you just get someone right.

2133
02:17:06.250 --> 02:17:09.980
You're so attracted to women that you're like,
you know what?
Let me see.

2134
02:17:10.010 --> 02:17:14.440
I'm not to wipe my ass.
Let's see what happens.
I still was still good.

2135
02:17:14.441 --> 02:17:15.770
I'll get four numbers.
Yeah.

2136
02:17:17.170 --> 02:17:20.110
I thought of something watching the r Kelly documentary,

2137
02:17:20.140 --> 02:17:25.140
which is so he's illiterate and he's the victim of sexual molestation at a young

2138
02:17:28.961 --> 02:17:32.680
age.
There you go.
So in essence,
he is precious.

2139
02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:36.130
He's,
yeah.

2140
02:17:37.460 --> 02:17:42.110
Am I running the booth?
Liked it.
He's precious.

2141
02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:47.210
I couldn't do that on the breakfast club.
No,
no,
no.
He's,

2142
02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:53.080
he's a person who just had a talent that crazy to other people like he,

2143
02:17:55.060 --> 02:17:57.240
but he is make no mistake.
And that's what Eric about,

2144
02:17:57.250 --> 02:18:01.120
dude got in trouble for sinks for.
She has empathy for him and bill Cosby.

2145
02:18:01.121 --> 02:18:05.020
It's like she's right.
You should have empathy for this person,

2146
02:18:05.050 --> 02:18:06.770
not for the actual fucking monster.

2147
02:18:07.220 --> 02:18:11.860
And he's a sociopath and he heard hundreds of people but he,

2148
02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:16.090
no one invented someone at some point invented mold molesting kids.
Yeah.

2149
02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:20.510
But every since then for the most part had it done to them and then they did it.

2150
02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:24.790
And it's like,
it's fucking sad and sick,

2151
02:18:24.791 --> 02:18:28.630
but like you feel bad.
I feel bad for the person.

2152
02:18:29.170 --> 02:18:31.930
I mean not like I actually feel bad for our Kelly,
but no,

2153
02:18:31.931 --> 02:18:36.120
and it's interesting what is precious to me because now it's now that it's

2154
02:18:36.121 --> 02:18:40.600
social media exists and we're discovering the truth about celebrities lives,

2155
02:18:40.601 --> 02:18:45.601
but there's a lot of pieces of shit that had been that really talented people.

2156
02:18:45.730 --> 02:18:49.560
I'm not going to say it's almost all right.
What?

2157
02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:51.370
It's fucking pretty close.

2158
02:18:51.580 --> 02:18:54.610
There's a Michael Jackson documentary coming out that's of like,

2159
02:18:54.611 --> 02:18:58.180
that's got to hurt him.
Like that's going to be it's sound machine.
It,
no,

2160
02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:01.280
but it's going to be at Sundance and it's going to be like,
it'll be,

2161
02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:04.480
isn't that one lambing wine and uh,

2162
02:19:04.540 --> 02:19:09.410
like it'll probably be tantamount to our Kelly's.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
How are we not,

2163
02:19:09.420 --> 02:19:13.630
what people are still on the fence about Mj?
Like,
no,
they weren't.
And then,

2164
02:19:13.660 --> 02:19:16.630
but time passed and there were no new allegations.

2165
02:19:16.660 --> 02:19:20.580
And what you hear if the Adam May have defenses,

2166
02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:25.360
voices taking moral inventory or listen to fucking thriller,

2167
02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:26.410
right.

2168
02:19:26.410 --> 02:19:30.840
I'm going to listen to thriller every time off the wall too.

2169
02:19:32.250 --> 02:19:36.680
Maybe more.
Cause yeah,
cause I,
you know,
I love disco.
Uh,

2170
02:19:36.710 --> 02:19:41.180
but like yet,
so time passes and people go,
that's what you remember.

2171
02:19:41.181 --> 02:19:45.560
You remember the fucking Showbiz is full of fucking monster bags.

2172
02:19:45.700 --> 02:19:48.880
Like there aren't very many in comedy anymore.

2173
02:19:49.300 --> 02:19:54.300
Like people that we all know is like a real fucking piece of garbage.

2174
02:19:54.441 --> 02:19:58.760
That's like the top people are not first not garbage,
Dave.
Chris,

2175
02:19:58.761 --> 02:20:02.690
like these guys are not garbage like Jim Jefferies,
Tom sicker and Neal Brennan.

2176
02:20:05.720 --> 02:20:10.580
I mean,
according to Brad Pitt,
um,
we're doing Brad's list only.
Oh,

2177
02:20:10.581 --> 02:20:15.500
we looked in the list.
Oh Sweetie.
Oh,
please.

2178
02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:20.560
Here.
Which should have like a,
we should have a party of Brad part us.
Um,

2179
02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:25.760
so rude.
So Jim and who?
Bill Burr.
Oh,
great list.

2180
02:20:26.700 --> 02:20:30.860
Great List.
Um,
so,
uh,
yeah,
but Michelle Biz is like,

2181
02:20:31.400 --> 02:20:35.950
I mean,
littered with fucking Presley.
Elvis Presley.

2182
02:20:37.130 --> 02:20:40.760
Jerry Lee Lewis fucks his cousin who's Polanski.

2183
02:20:41.720 --> 02:20:45.720
Polanski.
Well,
that's the thing where people are like,
are you worried about the,

2184
02:20:45.760 --> 02:20:47.210
where do you feel about,
about the Eric Kelly thing?

2185
02:20:47.211 --> 02:20:50.420
It's like Rick James was a convicted sex offender.

2186
02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:55.790
So I like,
I don't know what to tell you.
He had been locked up for,

2187
02:20:56.830 --> 02:21:01.760
uh,
uh,
holding a woman captive and burning her with a crack pipe.
Cheeses.

2188
02:21:02.660 --> 02:21:05.020
It's atrocious.
Yeah.

2189
02:21:05.420 --> 02:21:08.090
But that sketch is fucking hilarious.
It's like,

2190
02:21:08.091 --> 02:21:12.390
have you seen the sketch is a hilarious doubt,

2191
02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:14.930
a monster.
And we say at the end,
Rick,

2192
02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:19.850
you are forgiven for all of your crimes.
Um,
so,

2193
02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:24.860
uh,
yeah,
Showbiz moms,
but I think it's less and less,
I think.

2194
02:21:24.861 --> 02:21:29.720
I think it's less,
I think it's less like,
like it used like Jesus,

2195
02:21:29.721 --> 02:21:33.200
like that type of shit like drugging bill Cosby,

2196
02:21:33.470 --> 02:21:38.420
drugged crazy 60 women that aren't,

2197
02:21:38.421 --> 02:21:42.500
that came forward.
60 sets.
Insane man.

2198
02:21:43.190 --> 02:21:46.310
But those women all got together and conspire.
Yeah.
And they're all,

2199
02:21:46.390 --> 02:21:48.690
they're laughing the way all the way to the back.
They're making millions.

2200
02:21:48.691 --> 02:21:50.010
They're victimizing their way all the way.
The bank,

2201
02:21:50.990 --> 02:21:55.900
they've opened like tons of businesses and like,
like fucking a long plan.
Yeah,

2202
02:21:55.920 --> 02:21:59.470
like houses.
It's actually a really great entrepreneurial project.

2203
02:22:01.190 --> 02:22:04.340
I told the story in Rogan,
but I had a,
this was,

2204
02:22:04.430 --> 02:22:08.200
I dated a girl in Oh four,

2205
02:22:08.210 --> 02:22:12.470
five six who like beautiful mixed girl.

2206
02:22:13.070 --> 02:22:17.570
And uh,
and she,
I mentioned bill Cosby at one point.
She was like,
Oh,
Mr Cosby,

2207
02:22:18.140 --> 02:22:20.390
what a good guy.
And I was like,
you know,

2208
02:22:20.391 --> 02:22:22.340
when a girl says something where you know,
she fucked him,

2209
02:22:22.341 --> 02:22:27.210
he like one set up and uh,
and I was like,
what?
And she's like,
Oh yeah,
no,
I know,

2210
02:22:27.270 --> 02:22:30.630
I know Mr me.
And I was like,
what are you,
what are you talking about?
She's like,

2211
02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:31.591
oh,

2212
02:22:31.591 --> 02:22:36.591
like one day I was on the street crying and he came up next to me and he likes,

2213
02:22:38.250 --> 02:22:43.170
said what's the matter?
And he befriended me and he took me to a,

2214
02:22:43.171 --> 02:22:48.150
we went to a play one time and um,
and then,

2215
02:22:48.210 --> 02:22:51.840
and I'm like,
you know,
I'm just trying to fuck you and this is in like,

2216
02:22:51.860 --> 02:22:55.260
oh four or five.
And she's like,
no,
please,
like,

2217
02:22:55.680 --> 02:22:56.900
and then one time he,

2218
02:22:56.940 --> 02:23:01.110
I was supposed to come to Philadelphia and I got sick,

2219
02:23:01.600 --> 02:23:04.710
but we're thing he did tell me how to like style my hair,

2220
02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:09.190
hair and what dress to wear.
I was like,
he was trying to fuck.

2221
02:23:09.191 --> 02:23:12.610
And she was like,
nope.
And then all this shit comes out and I texted,
I go,

2222
02:23:12.611 --> 02:23:16.680
what do you think your boy?
And she's like,
I think he,

2223
02:23:17.030 --> 02:23:19.660
his wife was in on it and just all this shit buy in on it.

2224
02:23:19.710 --> 02:23:22.160
Then it was like all this shit of like,
oh,

2225
02:23:22.190 --> 02:23:24.980
so all it took was it bit of like,

2226
02:23:26.330 --> 02:23:29.870
I don't even like she snapped her up and was like,
oh yeah,
he was.
Yeah.

2227
02:23:29.871 --> 02:23:34.550
Why would any guy guys are not nice to women for no reason.
Absolutely.

2228
02:23:34.551 --> 02:23:39.410
Here's the deal.
The under any circumstance,
a lot of women don't,
myself included.

2229
02:23:39.440 --> 02:23:42.590
You don't learn that until you're older.
Like you genuinely think,

2230
02:23:42.591 --> 02:23:43.790
here's why and here's why.

2231
02:23:43.791 --> 02:23:48.791
I had the audacity to think I was a human and that you're not and you're right

2232
02:23:49.280 --> 02:23:50.950
and that man you are not right.

2233
02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:54.380
But that's the thing is I go into the world assuming that I have the same rights

2234
02:23:54.381 --> 02:23:56.890
and privileges as a human fucking being.
Yup.

2235
02:23:56.960 --> 02:24:00.530
And then you just don't think you're like,
oh that guy just wants to fight what?

2236
02:24:00.531 --> 02:24:03.080
I'm just a piece of meat.
I'm an object.
And then you learn,

2237
02:24:03.081 --> 02:24:07.710
you're just an object layer to certain people.
Not all men.
Yeah.
But yeah,
you,

2238
02:24:07.711 --> 02:24:11.870
you think you were once like the cool fucking once you'd like to fuck.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2239
02:24:11.871 --> 02:24:13.600
That's what I'm told is you get down as much.

2240
02:24:13.630 --> 02:24:17.150
That fucking sucks cause then you grow up and then you learn that about dudes

2241
02:24:17.151 --> 02:24:19.610
and now you have to be like,
oh,
I tell you get married.

2242
02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:24.530
And that's the cool part is that it's becomes a like a Burka essentially.

2243
02:24:24.770 --> 02:24:27.260
And now I become a person again.
Once you're married,

2244
02:24:27.261 --> 02:24:31.280
especially to another comic and like a guy that can kill another man.
Right.

2245
02:24:31.310 --> 02:24:34.340
The other dudes know it and now I get to see who's cool and new,

2246
02:24:34.341 --> 02:24:38.060
but I feel like you'd be cool if I fucked your wife right now we're into that.

2247
02:24:38.450 --> 02:24:42.770
Yes,
that's right.
You're on the plane was Eddie Murphy.

2248
02:24:42.890 --> 02:24:47.240
You know what I mean?
It's true.
That is,
but yeah,
that's,
yeah,

2249
02:24:47.450 --> 02:24:49.960
it's a fucking Chappelle used to do a joke.
It's,

2250
02:24:50.230 --> 02:24:53.760
he did this when he was like 22 or something.
Yeah.

2251
02:24:54.360 --> 02:24:59.360
Maybe women can't sense danger until they're like 30 that's pretty for like,

2252
02:24:59.641 --> 02:25:01.670
maybe I shouldn't get into the van with all of it.
All of them.

2253
02:25:03.130 --> 02:25:07.970
He's just a fucking crazy good at observation ended up.
But uh,
but yeah,

2254
02:25:07.971 --> 02:25:08.980
like the,
the,

2255
02:25:09.140 --> 02:25:13.900
this thing of like guys are not nice for no guys are just not like that.
Yeah.

2256
02:25:13.970 --> 02:25:18.560
Like there's,
if a guy is being nice to you,
he wants to have sex with you.

2257
02:25:18.740 --> 02:25:19.790
I know.
That's true.

2258
02:25:19.970 --> 02:25:23.560
And actually the funny thing is the flip side is [inaudible] Wong always says

2259
02:25:23.561 --> 02:25:27.240
like,
Neil,
you have like all these like antique views of women.
Like,

2260
02:25:27.580 --> 02:25:30.430
like I'm like men and women kind of aren't friends and she's like,

2261
02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:35.020
I'm friends with so many guys.
I'm like,
I don't know Allie.
Like I'm sure she is,

2262
02:25:35.021 --> 02:25:38.350
but I don't think I'm uh,

2263
02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:42.910
I have like antiquarian views.
Well,
I think you're,
I think you're mostly right.

2264
02:25:42.940 --> 02:25:44.740
What happens though as a guy is like,

2265
02:25:44.741 --> 02:25:49.570
once you yourself get married and have children,
then you're just like,

2266
02:25:49.780 --> 02:25:51.040
oh,
women are people too.

2267
02:25:51.300 --> 02:25:56.300
And I think that 50 is the age where I'll actually handles and now you become a

2268
02:25:58.781 --> 02:26:01.690
person.
No,
it started to go down and then,
yeah.

2269
02:26:01.700 --> 02:26:06.210
Then your testosterone gets to like manageable levels.
You're still monster,

2270
02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:10.990
still a monster,
but it's like,
oh yeah,
I'm a monster sometimes.

2271
02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:15.190
Do you think it's testosterone that makes you monsters?
It's,

2272
02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:17.870
you know that women have children.
They are,

2273
02:26:17.871 --> 02:26:19.510
their testosterone goes down when they're just,

2274
02:26:19.590 --> 02:26:23.080
when they spend time around children because the body is like,
hey,

2275
02:26:23.081 --> 02:26:26.500
you're going to do something crazy.
Yeah.
Around these you can feel it,

2276
02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:30.380
you could feel it and you become genuinely friendly to women.

2277
02:26:31.990 --> 02:26:36.520
You become a woman.
I'm more like a woman than a woman becomes like a man.
Yes.

2278
02:26:37.090 --> 02:26:41.530
And then what happens to us is we wise up to the system and the matrix and we're

2279
02:26:41.531 --> 02:26:42.370
like,
wait a minute.

2280
02:26:42.371 --> 02:26:46.600
And then we want me to wear spanx and we get like if we're just around those

2281
02:26:46.601 --> 02:26:50.440
kids,
we stay that way.
But if we get away from the kids and then we're like,

2282
02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:53.350
what am I becoming?
And then you see a girl walking down the street,

2283
02:26:53.351 --> 02:26:56.560
you put on your car,
you can shut the fuck up.
You just do something.

2284
02:26:56.880 --> 02:27:01.520
We'll call you,
like to stay.
You like to remain sexy in case she came,

2285
02:27:01.521 --> 02:27:04.480
it dies.
Right?
Absolutely.
We talk about this constantly.

2286
02:27:04.481 --> 02:27:08.350
Got to keep it out a little bit.
I just had a physical,
um,

2287
02:27:08.460 --> 02:27:12.070
I'm scoring numbers,
man.
He's like putting up numbers.
Like you're looking great.

2288
02:27:12.071 --> 02:27:15.980
You're doing great.
Drop 63 on this amount of pounds.
Dropping bombs on spools.

2289
02:27:16.030 --> 02:27:20.100
We talk about what the second wife will be like,
the Dalmatian one,

2290
02:27:21.870 --> 02:27:26.830
she's 23 tops.
It's funny,
I don't want to bother you.

2291
02:27:26.910 --> 02:27:29.890
And Korea doesn't ask too many questions.

2292
02:27:29.970 --> 02:27:34.520
It doesn't want to see bank accounts by the way.
Gives me my blowing.
Yeah,

2293
02:27:34.720 --> 02:27:39.010
that's the dream wife.
Yeah.
I mean honestly like,
uh,

2294
02:27:39.070 --> 02:27:42.400
when women are,
I don't
know,

2295
02:27:42.500 --> 02:27:46.930
it's pretty like why when people go,
don't you want someone who challenges,

2296
02:27:46.931 --> 02:27:48.370
you know,

2297
02:27:48.790 --> 02:27:53.080
don't you want to go on the treadmill at fucking eight uphill?

2298
02:27:53.890 --> 02:27:56.890
Why the fuck would I want that in my life?
No,
it's true.

2299
02:27:56.891 --> 02:28:00.070
On a fucking rubber stamp that you said it,

2300
02:28:00.071 --> 02:28:02.020
Mr. The narrative of like,

2301
02:28:02.050 --> 02:28:06.190
I want to be challenged and it's good you say it because it's your reality.

2302
02:28:06.520 --> 02:28:09.570
So like I say like,
Oh,

2303
02:28:10.390 --> 02:28:14.830
like articulate women because I have one.
Exactly.

2304
02:28:14.831 --> 02:28:18.040
I can't be like,
it's fucking sucks.
I love jail.

2305
02:28:19.320 --> 02:28:21.440
This shit then.
Oh yeah.

2306
02:28:21.441 --> 02:28:23.930
And especially now because you have to give me half your stuff.

2307
02:28:24.650 --> 02:28:29.330
If we split now what?
You didn't hear what you didn't here with the prenup.

2308
02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:33.780
Oh,
you didn't hear about that?
You didn't hear about that
last night.

2309
02:28:34.550 --> 02:28:37.370
What about your ration?
Is she a Dalmatian?
You got some money too.

2310
02:28:37.371 --> 02:28:39.870
You're doing all right.
Yeah.
It's tough to talk about it or you.

2311
02:28:39.890 --> 02:28:43.550
So as you're rushing a Dalmatian,
no,
he said she seemed very appropriate.
Yeah,

2312
02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:46.430
she's age appropriate yet.
Cause I'm wow.

2313
02:28:46.431 --> 02:28:50.710
Before that it was like not age appropriate.
Yeah,
but a nice,

2314
02:28:51.170 --> 02:28:56.090
that one.
I gotta think so.
I have to play defense against her desires.

2315
02:28:56.120 --> 02:29:01.010
Like,
no,
this is battling now.
I'm not a cop.
Not a fucking,
I'm not,
uh,
I'm not,

2316
02:29:01.011 --> 02:29:05.390
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
career like I'm not,
if a girl likes me,
I'm not going to be like,

2317
02:29:05.860 --> 02:29:09.940
<v 19>no,
you shouldn't see you guys talk the big talk.
But at the end of the day,</v>

2318
02:29:10.450 --> 02:29:13.600
you like having your belly scratched and having love.

2319
02:29:13.690 --> 02:29:15.800
You have a 21 year olds can do that.
They can,

2320
02:29:15.850 --> 02:29:20.380
but you could not tolerate a millennial girl.
Oh my gosh.

2321
02:29:20.710 --> 02:29:24.240
I can't tell her to tolerate that personality.
No.
Uh,

2322
02:29:25.220 --> 02:29:28.800
there's this,
uh,
that uh,

2323
02:29:28.860 --> 02:29:30.400
oh I was at Bloomingdale's.

2324
02:29:30.840 --> 02:29:34.150
<v 18>Like I'd be like,
all right.
Yeah,
that's true.
I would be fucking annoyed.</v>

2325
02:29:34.210 --> 02:29:38.410
Well that's the thing that like when I was single,
like I couldn't even,

2326
02:29:39.160 --> 02:29:41.230
I be like,
oh I can't talk.

2327
02:29:41.290 --> 02:29:45.850
I would facetime women if I'd met him on an APP.
I would literally,

2328
02:29:46.140 --> 02:29:49.840
where we met or date,
like one on a date,
I'm like,
I'm gonna face them,

2329
02:29:49.841 --> 02:29:53.320
this person.
Cause you can't,
it's not the same as being in person,

2330
02:29:53.321 --> 02:29:56.620
but like it's close.
Yeah.
And you can get a sense of like,

2331
02:29:56.650 --> 02:29:59.950
oh I don't want to spend another s fucking second.
Yeah.

2332
02:30:00.040 --> 02:30:02.860
Smart having to listen to you.
I remember that taken out.

2333
02:30:02.890 --> 02:30:06.520
I took out of the fund box,
a heroin time where it was like,

2334
02:30:06.730 --> 02:30:08.860
is that the most offensive thing you could call her?

2335
02:30:09.440 --> 02:30:11.860
I could probably like box the hairs up there.
It's up there.

2336
02:30:11.950 --> 02:30:14.800
I mean there's nothing that's offensive.
Box of hair is,

2337
02:30:14.801 --> 02:30:18.790
so first of all it's nonsense.
Yeah.
That's part,

2338
02:30:18.791 --> 02:30:23.140
that's why I was in there.
Right there.
Yeah,
but box,
I mean it's just,

2339
02:30:23.680 --> 02:30:26.890
it's so disrespectful.
Wonderful.
Yeah.

2340
02:30:27.610 --> 02:30:31.540
I mean she was like,
there was the kind of person,
she was really pretty and I go,

2341
02:30:31.541 --> 02:30:35.230
I'm like,
what do you want to do now?
You know,
we're like,

2342
02:30:35.231 --> 02:30:38.050
what do you want to eat or something?
And she was like,
yeah,

2343
02:30:38.900 --> 02:30:42.580
what do you want to eat?
I was like,
okay,
let's eat this.
And then it was like,

2344
02:30:43.230 --> 02:30:46.150
and like,
so where,
you know like during like the general conversations I like,

2345
02:30:46.450 --> 02:30:51.250
do you like music to gas?
I was like,
yeah.

2346
02:30:51.280 --> 02:30:55.000
And working like they act,
they feel like they're being like,
it's like a fucking

2347
02:30:55.420 --> 02:30:59.890
<v 19>first 48 asking you if you like music.
He fucking box.</v>

2348
02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:04.900
No box.
I hair,
no opinions.
You dumb fucking,

2349
02:31:05.290 --> 02:31:08.040
she must have been hot cause that's all you guys care about.

2350
02:31:08.050 --> 02:31:12.940
That's why I asked her
about getting her phone number.
You got a phone number,

2351
02:31:13.090 --> 02:31:17.080
you're like,
it's always based on the floor model.
All right.
I want the number,

2352
02:31:17.930 --> 02:31:20.340
you call the number and set it up and you're like,
all right.

2353
02:31:20.730 --> 02:31:24.800
<v 18>And then the exchange is like,
oh yeah,
like I there,</v>

2354
02:31:24.810 --> 02:31:27.900
no sex is worth this.
Oh yeah.

2355
02:31:27.930 --> 02:31:31.560
Like it's not worth like you can't,
after a certain age you're like,

2356
02:31:31.770 --> 02:31:36.480
I can't the rest of your body,
the parts of your body that's not dick.
Or like,

2357
02:31:36.481 --> 02:31:39.420
we're not putting up with this.
Well this is how bad this was.

2358
02:31:40.110 --> 02:31:42.240
I was all dick when this happened and this is like,

2359
02:31:42.241 --> 02:31:46.590
I'm like 22 and I still was like,
no,
no way.

2360
02:31:46.620 --> 02:31:47.980
It's too much work.
Yeah.

2361
02:31:48.360 --> 02:31:53.360
I saw a lot of one too lazy hunter though I am 26 I had to kind of initiate our

2362
02:31:56.461 --> 02:32:00.650
court ship a little bit.
Yeah,
it wasn't,
I was never like,
I just,
you know,

2363
02:32:00.710 --> 02:32:03.900
I had my,
my one of my roommates was one of those like,
you know,

2364
02:32:03.901 --> 02:32:07.860
all systems go guys who's just like,
we should hang out.
We should did man.

2365
02:32:08.220 --> 02:32:11.430
And like we would be at a bar and he was next to him.
He was like,

2366
02:32:11.730 --> 02:32:13.950
how are you doing the night?
You're beautiful.
I'm feeling,

2367
02:32:14.430 --> 02:32:19.320
I feel happy now that I'm just talking to him like and like depth went away.

2368
02:32:19.620 --> 02:32:21.450
He would look across the room,
boom.

2369
02:32:21.660 --> 02:32:24.150
And then you'd see him with a different girl and then we'd leave the club,

2370
02:32:24.450 --> 02:32:27.970
he'd be with another and he was just going to take what else?
Anything.
Yeah,

2371
02:32:28.060 --> 02:32:30.120
cause he had to,
Yup.
I was like,
look,

2372
02:32:30.121 --> 02:32:34.590
if if it's not like in my eye line and kind of generates itself,

2373
02:32:34.860 --> 02:32:38.760
I'm out.
But I mean now you haven't been single in the age of May to now.

2374
02:32:39.060 --> 02:32:42.960
Like I'm literally sitting women like Ari,

2375
02:32:43.090 --> 02:32:46.070
do you want to fuck me?
Oh right.

2376
02:32:46.080 --> 02:32:49.860
Not playing this like mystery game.

2377
02:32:50.440 --> 02:32:53.880
Like you put it out there that clearly pretty,
I won't say,

2378
02:32:53.881 --> 02:32:57.450
I don't think I say fuck,
but like I'm like,
you know,

2379
02:32:57.600 --> 02:33:02.430
lay my sheets naked probably.
Now is this on an APP?
You do app dating,

2380
02:33:02.431 --> 02:33:03.510
but I'm this,
but that was back then.

2381
02:33:04.440 --> 02:33:08.740
Did you do like the celebrity of the Riaa and I did the uh,

2382
02:33:08.770 --> 02:33:12.960
the Tinder,
but the big one,

2383
02:33:12.961 --> 02:33:14.970
I mean I would get a lot of income.
I mostly,

2384
02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:18.930
I don't do any outcome but a lot of incoming on Instagram.
Interesting.

2385
02:33:19.280 --> 02:33:22.730
You get hit up a lot.
Yeah.
Really?
Wow.
What kind of girl?
You know,

2386
02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:27.120
it's funny when I do the breakfast club,
uh,
40 black women in my,

2387
02:33:27.270 --> 02:33:28.570
it might be Ms. Yeah.

2388
02:33:29.100 --> 02:33:33.680
Every time you're like a white guy flavor.
Tell me about,

2389
02:33:33.800 --> 02:33:38.010
you're doing this.
They're black.
Bummer.
Yes.
The autism

2390
02:33:39.540 --> 02:33:44.490
black bummers.
Um,
yes.
So,

2391
02:33:44.520 --> 02:33:48.270
so yeah,
would just girls like straight up hitting him,
which is great.

2392
02:33:48.320 --> 02:33:51.090
Good for you.
Well I'm sure you do too,
but you just ignore it.

2393
02:33:51.091 --> 02:33:54.870
It doesn't tell me he pretends like he doesn't,
I really listen,

2394
02:33:55.050 --> 02:34:00.050
I've told you I do get hit on like once every few years,

2395
02:34:00.811 --> 02:34:05.550
but by somebody that's respectable and then Oh,
the rest of it's like,

2396
02:34:05.580 --> 02:34:08.580
Oh I a lot of them on slack and I get some boxing

2397
02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:12.660
girls with the rub,
rub,
rub shirts.
I get,

2398
02:34:12.661 --> 02:34:17.650
I get some animals and then I definitely get a lot of compliments.

2399
02:34:17.651 --> 02:34:18.070
I wouldn't say

2400
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:21.510
<v 4>like asking me compliments from gay dudes.
Yes,
that's it.</v>

2401
02:34:21.820 --> 02:34:25.060
I get very little gay foot traffic on.
I get,

2402
02:34:25.090 --> 02:34:29.170
I get something and it's always a misdirect.
It'll be like,
saw your special man.

2403
02:34:29.171 --> 02:34:33.830
I laughed my ass off.
Doesn't hurt that you're easy on the eyes.
What?
So you know,

2404
02:34:33.880 --> 02:34:37.610
stuff like that.
Yeah.
That's a funny and you're cute.
Yeah.

2405
02:34:37.810 --> 02:34:42.490
That's how girls will just burst joke about like having me a hit on him.

2406
02:34:43.030 --> 02:34:44.030
Remember that trick?
It's not huh?

2407
02:34:44.290 --> 02:34:49.290
He did a joke about like Nia was making fun of a guy having no game and burrow

2408
02:34:49.931 --> 02:34:54.130
was like,
all right,
hit on me.
No,
go fucking a hit on me.
And she went like,

2409
02:34:54.910 --> 02:34:59.650
hi.
And he's like,
is that your fucking,
it's fucking hilarious.
But,

2410
02:34:59.770 --> 02:35:03.460
but yeah,
girls are bad at it on it's there,
but someone will just be like,

2411
02:35:03.461 --> 02:35:06.140
you're really super fun and I want to pass.

2412
02:35:06.170 --> 02:35:08.590
I'll get a lunatic is what I'm saying.
Cause most of the,

2413
02:35:08.591 --> 02:35:10.630
if they're a fan of mine or something,
they'll know my situation.

2414
02:35:10.660 --> 02:35:13.090
You just don't do it.
Yeah,

2415
02:35:13.630 --> 02:35:16.150
Just lunatic who's like,

2419
02:35:30.821 --> 02:35:34.560
Don't get it.
We love,
these are good girls,
girls.

2420
02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:36.110
They're good girls.

2421
02:35:38.830 --> 02:35:41.920
Why don't you DM him or once in a while.
Keep it fucking interesting.
Yeah.

2422
02:35:42.790 --> 02:35:47.650
Why don't you slide up
near the DM.
Stop texting me.

2423
02:35:47.680 --> 02:35:51.010
Stop.
[inaudible] get off this APP.
Get on another APP.

2424
02:35:52.850 --> 02:35:55.830
We got to tell her.
We got to actually,
we've got to have a break with,

2425
02:35:55.831 --> 02:36:00.130
but real quick,
this is going to be you here.
Oh,
it's right.
Mommy knew Brandon.

2426
02:36:00.131 --> 02:36:03.610
Do you have any dates coming up?
Anything,
any shows you want to know?

2427
02:36:03.611 --> 02:36:07.260
I really don't like,
I don't want that thing.
And then,

2428
02:36:07.380 --> 02:36:12.380
and then now I'm just at the store and the west side and he has a special,

2429
02:36:13.181 --> 02:36:16.990
another special I should say out on Netflix.
Now.
It's Comedians of the world.

2430
02:36:17.200 --> 02:36:21.880
You can also watch three mikes on Netflix.
Um,

2431
02:36:22.540 --> 02:36:25.060
of course,
if you've never seen Chappelle show,

2432
02:36:25.630 --> 02:36:30.630
get all those DVDs or just rip still available guys,
he still has a piece.

2433
02:36:30.630 --> 02:36:35.310
They'll get a little taste,
a little little fun little web.

2434
02:36:35.311 --> 02:36:39.790
My big little bit still there.
It's gotta be good.

2435
02:36:40.750 --> 02:36:44.890
You guys are doing,
you are too blessed to be stressed.
Excellent.

2436
02:36:45.790 --> 02:36:46.061
Look,

2437
02:36:46.061 --> 02:36:50.890
we have to break but I feel like we could podcast with you for hours and hours

2438
02:36:50.890 --> 02:36:53.860
and hours.
Can we do another one when you come back and we can like break down.

2439
02:36:53.870 --> 02:36:57.790
Are we done?
Yeah.
Yeah,
we're pretty much done.
Yeah.
Um,
but it's,

2440
02:36:57.880 --> 02:37:01.390
it's really fun to talk to you man.
It's fun.

2441
02:37:01.391 --> 02:37:03.310
I love hanging out with other guys in the pit.
Click.

2442
02:37:03.311 --> 02:37:05.330
I call it the Brad Pitt Click.

2443
02:37:05.331 --> 02:37:09.920
It's Brad Pitt Line said finds funny.
I was on Brad Pitt.

2444
02:37:11.280 --> 02:37:16.120
George Takei.
There you go.
That's pretty good.
Alright,
thanks.

2445
02:37:16.130 --> 02:37:18.860
<v 19>You're a good girl.
Thanks Neal Brennan.
Oh yeah,</v>

2446
02:37:20.500 --> 02:37:25.500
we'll be back to talking about after this quick break and we are back and guess

2447
02:37:28.461 --> 02:37:30.800
what Justin?
Couple days ago,

2448
02:37:30.980 --> 02:37:35.210
season three graduate,
gone smashing

2449
02:37:37.390 --> 02:37:42.390
premiered on Archie bit oh Latino and and it will keep airing Sundays at 10:00

2450
02:37:44.930 --> 02:37:49.400
PM even though the star of the show has seasoned to his information on their

2451
02:37:49.401 --> 02:37:53.560
Twitter page.
There is something I've verified.

2452
02:37:53.561 --> 02:37:58.310
All the info is correct.
It is.
Graphic is still season two.
Oh,
the graphic.

2453
02:37:58.311 --> 02:38:00.590
You're always just talking shit.
I resent.

2454
02:38:00.620 --> 02:38:03.650
There's no way to say this because it will not send graphics anymore.

2455
02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:05.770
I think it's supposed to be my pub.

2456
02:38:06.950 --> 02:38:11.330
Here's how you can sound like a jerk right away.
My says,
then you're done.

2457
02:38:11.331 --> 02:38:14.240
You're done.
You're done.
All of my friends are going,

2458
02:38:14.300 --> 02:38:17.960
he's changed and they never thought that until I started saying things like,

2459
02:38:18.500 --> 02:38:21.860
like having a publicist.
No,
no.
I hate all of it.

2460
02:38:22.190 --> 02:38:25.690
Don't you fucked it all up.
What?

2461
02:38:25.700 --> 02:38:29.810
We're standing up something so pure and I'm not shitting on them specifically.

2462
02:38:29.811 --> 02:38:32.180
I'm just saying the system.
It's Rick.

2463
02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:36.920
I'm a big believer in just like I love my manager and if he was here I would say

2464
02:38:36.921 --> 02:38:40.910
this.
It's sort of an outdated thing.
We all know each other.

2465
02:38:40.911 --> 02:38:42.420
Who booked me on this show.
Right?

2466
02:38:43.550 --> 02:38:47.330
I emailed the Dov actually texted you and you get me no Dobson.

2467
02:38:47.900 --> 02:38:50.930
And I'm not saying it's just like it's,
it's not because I'm special.

2468
02:38:51.080 --> 02:38:55.400
We're in a different world.
Right.
Can Twitter DM Pete,
was that a sound effect?

2469
02:38:55.401 --> 02:38:58.340
That was not a sound effect.
That was a real fart.

2470
02:38:59.210 --> 02:39:02.500
That was not a real Forcina.
Just fart it into the Fart Mike.

2471
02:39:03.700 --> 02:39:06.210
That's the fart.
Oh my God.

2472
02:39:06.211 --> 02:39:11.080
And you were saying something meaningful and of substance and shad is,

2473
02:39:11.710 --> 02:39:14.370
it's sandwiched camera.
Do I cresinsky too.

2474
02:39:17.860 --> 02:39:21.680
I'd like to thank everybody.
Here's on Hilarious,

2475
02:39:21.950 --> 02:39:23.690
but that is how I feel about all of it

2476
02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:28.430
for providing the guests for that far.
It was pretty loud.

2477
02:39:29.690 --> 02:39:33.460
I can tell you're jealous and you're upset.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2478
02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:39.090
My Mom's
my mom.
Very liberal fighter.

2479
02:39:40.430 --> 02:39:41.750
Oh yeah.
And Your Dad.

2480
02:39:42.280 --> 02:39:46.490
I could pick out one of my dad's farts in a lineup really by Salvador smell in

2481
02:39:46.491 --> 02:39:49.550
the dark.
Really?
Like there's an acidity,
there's a salt and vinegar.

2482
02:39:52.810 --> 02:39:56.780
Every 15th part that I fart will be one of my dad's.
And I'm like,

2483
02:39:58.690 --> 02:40:01.220
that's kind of special though,
right?
Especially,
I guess,

2484
02:40:01.221 --> 02:40:03.510
but you don't want to become your Purdue,
you know,

2485
02:40:03.550 --> 02:40:06.380
one of your efforts to remind you of the trap,

2486
02:40:06.410 --> 02:40:09.320
the meat puppet that you inherited from those two lunatics.

2487
02:40:11.480 --> 02:40:15.630
That's my dad is my dad.
It's your dad.
It's really my dad.

2488
02:40:15.870 --> 02:40:19.890
Oh my God.
Yeah.
That is amazing.
Where are you from?
Canada.

2489
02:40:19.950 --> 02:40:21.900
He's from Massachusetts,
Massachusetts.

2490
02:40:21.901 --> 02:40:26.850
Can you at least have morning radio etiquette and throw up my Wikipedia page?

2491
02:40:27.950 --> 02:40:31.500
I then asked me what do you want us to ask you?
What do you want us to ask you?

2492
02:40:31.970 --> 02:40:34.440
What do you want to talk about it?
What you want us to ask you?
Yeah.
What are you,

2493
02:40:34.441 --> 02:40:37.020
what are your leading?
I actually,

2494
02:40:37.021 --> 02:40:39.750
have you ever done a radio interview and you know what's coming next?

2495
02:40:39.751 --> 02:40:41.760
Because they're going in the order.
Oh yeah.
Again,

2496
02:40:41.761 --> 02:40:43.980
these are fancy people problems I suppose,
but I'm like,

2497
02:40:44.040 --> 02:40:47.970
you're going to ask you about like my,
my Wikipedia page has a Batman.

2498
02:40:47.971 --> 02:40:49.920
I did the Batman videos.
I don't know if you know that.

2499
02:40:49.921 --> 02:40:51.030
You don't know where the fuck I'm from,

2500
02:40:51.031 --> 02:40:55.350
so I'm guessing you did your Wikipedia page listening to you or the e trade baby

2501
02:40:55.380 --> 02:40:59.580
and then it says that nobody knows that.
So that's when it gives away.

2502
02:40:59.581 --> 02:41:03.220
If they go Batman e trade baby,
I'm like,
you're reading off,
which is fine.

2503
02:41:03.230 --> 02:41:07.560
It's just fine.
It's what I do when I have shows that they did the minimum.

2504
02:41:07.590 --> 02:41:09.960
That's what I mean and it's actually I take it back.

2505
02:41:09.961 --> 02:41:10.920
It doesn't mean you don't care.

2506
02:41:10.921 --> 02:41:13.860
It just means like sometimes it's fun to just talk to somebody without knowing

2507
02:41:15.910 --> 02:41:19.630
from Boston.
I look Canadian,
very friendly.

2508
02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:25.890
I'm from Canada.
I'm a proud Windsor native,
as Tom Likes to call it

2509
02:41:28.290 --> 02:41:31.380
now.
It's very different.
I thought you were trying to exclude me and go,

2510
02:41:31.381 --> 02:41:34.460
what do you Canada but going,
are you us?

2511
02:41:37.290 --> 02:41:41.840
Well,
yeah,
right Fart.
Like you
know,

2512
02:41:43.890 --> 02:41:46.560
oh my God,
what do I do?
When I went to college,
somebody was like,

2513
02:41:46.561 --> 02:41:48.450
I know some older guy.
He was like,

2514
02:41:48.451 --> 02:41:51.450
you kids are out in your dorm lighting farts on fire

2515
02:41:53.310 --> 02:41:54.600
and we didn't know.
Like,

2516
02:41:54.780 --> 02:41:57.480
I don't know if you remember the feeling of being a freshman in college and I

2517
02:41:57.481 --> 02:41:59.850
want to do a weird Christian college that we weren't like drinking or anything.

2518
02:41:59.851 --> 02:42:02.910
Yeah,
I know it's weird,
but we didn't know what we were supposed to be doing,

2519
02:42:02.911 --> 02:42:06.930
so we took some offhanded comment that some guy like a fucking Dunkin donuts

2520
02:42:06.931 --> 02:42:10.800
said.
I guess that's what we do.
We live for,
it's on fire for the whole year

2521
02:42:13.230 --> 02:42:16.410
and there's like a campfire marshmallow.
He kind of,
there's like a,

2522
02:42:16.411 --> 02:42:18.780
it doesn't smell terrible.
It's,
what am I,
you know,
want to know something.

2523
02:42:19.140 --> 02:42:20.990
I've never done it.

2524
02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:27.150
I felt like I was a little intimidated by it and one of my good buddies in

2525
02:42:27.151 --> 02:42:29.610
college would do it and so I would just watch him and be like,
yeah,

2526
02:42:29.611 --> 02:42:33.000
that's well and the watch.
It's a little bit more of a threat

2527
02:42:34.910 --> 02:42:37.890
and it's very tricky because if you do it in denim,

2528
02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:42.060
you run the risk of kind of lighting your pants on fire.
Definitely.

2529
02:42:42.061 --> 02:42:45.120
We definitely let our pants on fire.
I would see it,
you know,

2530
02:42:45.690 --> 02:42:48.570
it would raise up towards the balls.
Yeah,

2531
02:42:48.600 --> 02:42:53.370
it glistens the ball kisses him.
But uh,

2532
02:42:53.371 --> 02:42:56.520
the real risk you run is shitting cause you get everybody around and you're
like,

2533
02:42:56.521 --> 02:43:00.050
Oh God,
I got a great one,
I got to get spread eagle.
Maybe your light.

2534
02:43:00.220 --> 02:43:04.630
It's very homoerotic.
Everyone's like,
yeah,
let your butthole light.

2535
02:43:05.100 --> 02:43:07.400
Because I would do a Christian school.
Everything we did that was rough.

2536
02:43:07.401 --> 02:43:10.860
Housing was very homoerotic and heartbreakingly a lot of those kids probably

2537
02:43:10.861 --> 02:43:13.720
we're a gay and that was like how they got it.
It's just like the gays.

2538
02:43:13.890 --> 02:43:15.450
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2539
02:43:15.590 --> 02:43:18.670
<v 19>Twitter girls at your school or was a singer word but you couldn't go to their</v>

2540
02:43:18.671 --> 02:43:21.220
side of the what?
Yeah,
I except for uh,

2541
02:43:21.340 --> 02:43:25.540
I think it was a three hour window most nights from like six to nine to six.

2542
02:43:25.541 --> 02:43:29.680
So you had a went,
you are on the same floor,
but there were,
what school was this?

2543
02:43:29.681 --> 02:43:32.050
Did you haven't heard of it?
It's called Gordon College,

2544
02:43:32.051 --> 02:43:35.230
which sounds like my parents hired a,
it sounds like you've made a wise,

2545
02:43:35.231 --> 02:43:38.920
old man Gordon to teach me what you end up at,
Gordon.

2546
02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:42.670
I was just scared.
It was like a play of being scared.
It was a church kid.

2547
02:43:42.910 --> 02:43:46.270
And then I was like,
uh,
really almost to this day,

2548
02:43:46.271 --> 02:43:50.200
still frightened of large universities like guys playing Okie cookie and

2549
02:43:50.201 --> 02:43:53.980
lacrosse sticks like blacked out drunk.
That's what I think schools are.

2550
02:43:53.981 --> 02:43:56.710
They're not so,
but like in high school you're like,
I you already know,

2551
02:43:56.711 --> 02:43:58.150
like I don't want to be near that.

2552
02:43:58.180 --> 02:44:01.750
It was either don't go to college and just like go right into like youth

2553
02:44:01.751 --> 02:44:05.860
ministry or go to a college where you could,
my mom actually was like,

2554
02:44:05.861 --> 02:44:10.060
you're gonna miss out on like a social thing more than the academics.

2555
02:44:10.061 --> 02:44:13.600
You're going to enjoy it.
And I did.
And that's where I like discovered,
uh,

2556
02:44:13.660 --> 02:44:17.950
with more depth that I wanted to do comedy and stuff cause it was so safe.
Yeah.

2557
02:44:17.980 --> 02:44:20.650
Nobody was allowed to make fun of you.
Oh,
right.
You know what I mean?

2558
02:44:20.651 --> 02:44:23.050
That was the right environment.
It was wonderful.

2559
02:44:23.051 --> 02:44:26.560
It wasn't just a big fish in a small pond.
It was like all nice fish,

2560
02:44:26.590 --> 02:44:29.710
you know what I mean?
To you fucking kind of,
I mean,
I was sincerely mean this.

2561
02:44:29.711 --> 02:44:30.370
Do you,
are you,

2562
02:44:30.370 --> 02:44:34.080
I know he's through the fuck in there for no new fracking when you're picking up

2563
02:44:34.090 --> 02:44:37.960
on my boss to Heidi.
Really.
Do you ever stop and go,
Holy Shit,

2564
02:44:38.020 --> 02:44:41.710
I have an HBO show.
Isn't that amazing?
It is amazing.

2565
02:44:41.770 --> 02:44:44.830
Sometimes when I smoked pot it helps me get into that place really.

2566
02:44:44.890 --> 02:44:48.520
Cause unfortunately it's not fortunate or unfortunate.
It just is what it is.

2567
02:44:48.820 --> 02:44:51.380
Sometimes you're just so busy in the thing.
Yeah.

2568
02:44:51.450 --> 02:44:54.650
But it's hard to get that outside of yourself perspective.
Yeah,

2569
02:44:54.651 --> 02:44:56.260
and I think that's one of the gifts.

2570
02:44:56.500 --> 02:44:59.290
One of our greatest plant allies can give us.

2571
02:44:59.470 --> 02:45:03.100
You smoke it and you don't feel like Pete anymore.
It takes it off the shelf.

2572
02:45:03.160 --> 02:45:05.930
Exactly.
Yeah.
Or it puts it on the shelf.
Right?

2573
02:45:06.070 --> 02:45:10.150
You take all of yourself and you go like,
oh fuck.
And you get in touch.

2574
02:45:10.640 --> 02:45:13.870
You know some people practice gratitude practice is very healthy for you.

2575
02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:17.420
I like to talk to like 10 year old me and tell him like,
yeah,

2576
02:45:17.980 --> 02:45:21.440
we became like forget the show.
You can just be like,
we're comedians.
Yeah.

2577
02:45:21.510 --> 02:45:24.490
We did it like we can go to the comedy store tonight and they'll be like,

2578
02:45:24.491 --> 02:45:26.810
do you want to go on?
Like that's a big deal.
It's true.

2579
02:45:26.860 --> 02:45:31.860
And then the show obviously has a lot of like a warmth and love for stand up

2580
02:45:31.940 --> 02:45:33.970
and,
and that.
That is also part of my dream as well.

2581
02:45:34.150 --> 02:45:35.440
But it's hard to get in touch with it then.

2582
02:45:35.470 --> 02:45:39.160
Then you smoke a little weed or something and it kind of puts you,
it's funny.

2583
02:45:39.250 --> 02:45:43.270
Does it always funny?
Is it like I'm never like,
oh dude it right.

2584
02:45:44.520 --> 02:45:47.920
But it's like talking to people in high school they called you the f word or

2585
02:45:47.921 --> 02:45:50.950
whatever you just said.
It's more like hilarious.
Right?

2586
02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:54.460
You realize these things happen.
They have to happen to people.

2587
02:45:54.461 --> 02:45:58.440
They're people like everybody that these things happen to our some guy.
Right.

2588
02:45:58.441 --> 02:46:01.210
That's your like you keep waiting for someone to realize you're just some guy.

2589
02:46:01.300 --> 02:46:03.430
We're all just some guy or some girls.
Yeah.
What do you mean?

2590
02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:05.190
How do you have this wisdom about you?

2591
02:46:06.790 --> 02:46:08.580
<v 0>I wish you wouldn't assume my pronouns.</v>

2592
02:46:10.300 --> 02:46:15.230
<v 19>I wish you would have spoken to a younger version of me.
I know.</v>

2593
02:46:15.260 --> 02:46:18.600
I wish I had known.
It's always been like this though.
Smart.
Yeah.
He has

2594
02:46:20.770 --> 02:46:22.880
the fucking guy,
Pete.

2595
02:46:23.180 --> 02:46:27.910
He's got this wisdom beyond his years.
That's very sweet.
How are you,

2596
02:46:27.911 --> 02:46:31.490
so you're so you're,
you're married,
you have a kid,
you have a grounded life.

2597
02:46:31.630 --> 02:46:32.350
I love it.

2598
02:46:32.350 --> 02:46:36.200
Did you have a struggle when you had the baby to care about anything baby

2599
02:46:39.470 --> 02:46:43.670
to care.
I want to get the
baby.

2600
02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:46.520
It's very like,
you know,

2601
02:46:46.521 --> 02:46:50.810
first of all I realize that nobody gives a fuck about your baby or rob Riggle.

2602
02:46:50.811 --> 02:46:54.020
When I had my baby,
maybe it was youtube pulled me aside and it was just like,

2603
02:46:54.021 --> 02:46:58.640
just so you know,
no one gives a fuck about your baby so you can keep this brief.

2604
02:46:58.730 --> 02:47:02.180
Especially in La.
This the town was special babies,

2605
02:47:03.330 --> 02:47:08.060
babies driving our fucking testlet corvette convertible going,
I'm the king,

2606
02:47:08.061 --> 02:47:09.970
I'm the king.
I'm like,
do you ever go to the funding?

2607
02:47:10.010 --> 02:47:11.600
Like a Golden Globe party or something?

2608
02:47:11.720 --> 02:47:14.000
We weren't nominated but I went to the HBO go and go party.

2609
02:47:14.240 --> 02:47:18.290
It's just a room full of special people wondering if we're all special,

2610
02:47:18.291 --> 02:47:22.580
who will look at us and make us feel special.
It's like a nightmare.
That is a,

2611
02:47:22.700 --> 02:47:26.620
that's for me the probably the most anxiety filled.
It's the dia.

2612
02:47:26.630 --> 02:47:27.700
You can describe what's

2613
02:47:29.260 --> 02:47:34.260
going to like a Showbiz showbiz hardy party and feeling complete like I would,

2614
02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:38.490
I already know how I feel even going into like an agency.
Me,

2615
02:47:39.810 --> 02:47:44.090
it's not good for me.
It's not good for anybody.
It doesn't matter who you are.

2616
02:47:44.091 --> 02:47:46.610
I'm sure Jon Hamm comes home from that party and I was like,

2617
02:47:46.630 --> 02:47:50.600
well why am I depressed?
I know why ham.
I know why.

2618
02:47:51.240 --> 02:47:54.470
Because like it's a room full of look at me is I think there's look amazing.

2619
02:47:54.500 --> 02:47:58.430
There's ICU.
My wife Valerie is now,
I see you as a very powerful position.

2620
02:47:58.431 --> 02:47:59.720
It doesn't just mean you're the audience.

2621
02:47:59.721 --> 02:48:03.530
It means you have the quality of empathy that you can understand and appreciate.

2622
02:48:03.531 --> 02:48:06.200
Someone else really the look at me as their,
the lunatics,

2623
02:48:06.560 --> 02:48:08.160
but that's a room below look at me is,

2624
02:48:08.180 --> 02:48:10.240
and you go home with that sort of weird hollow feeling.

2625
02:48:11.620 --> 02:48:16.310
So then it got worse when I had the baby or better if it's a good thing,

2626
02:48:16.311 --> 02:48:21.240
it got better and you start going like,
I don't,
I don't really,
wow.

2627
02:48:21.241 --> 02:48:24.290
You can remain grateful that you're even kind of in this,

2628
02:48:24.350 --> 02:48:28.100
this industry and it is very fun.
You look at your baby and you're just like,

2629
02:48:28.101 --> 02:48:31.460
what?
She's there.
She's rocking.

2630
02:48:31.730 --> 02:48:34.850
She doesn't know who she is.
She doesn't have any goals.

2631
02:48:34.910 --> 02:48:37.940
She's just like a lump of beingness having,

2632
02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.900
and she's blissing out and you just want to hang out with her.
That's right.

2633
02:48:40.910 --> 02:48:44.030
That's right.
So what are you doing?
Like why am I like,
I got to go to this party?

2634
02:48:44.240 --> 02:48:45.260
Maybe,

2635
02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:50.440
maybe a fucking Joey Tata who played nap at nine oh two one hour will be there

2636
02:48:52.510 --> 02:48:55.400
and he'll come.
Joey will come.
Not Joey.
Joey.

2637
02:48:55.940 --> 02:48:59.330
Joey will come up to me like I just did Alan the other day.

2638
02:48:59.480 --> 02:49:03.010
I went in to Samuel L.
Jackson,
his dressing room.
Why?
Because not because,

2639
02:49:03.050 --> 02:49:06.350
because I'm thinking he might go,
hey man,
I love your show.

2640
02:49:07.050 --> 02:49:08.370
That's what you're doing.
Right.

2641
02:49:08.610 --> 02:49:11.830
I also wanted just to say he's a legend and he's the greatest,
but like it's,

2642
02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:15.750
it's,
it's a bit of a,
I would try to meet Sam l Jackson.
He was right there.

2643
02:49:15.780 --> 02:49:18.030
Did you meet him?
I didn't go out of my way.
Yeah,
I went in there.

2644
02:49:18.070 --> 02:49:22.200
How would he know what he did?
He was very sweet.
It was him and two other people.

2645
02:49:22.201 --> 02:49:27.040
It probably a stylist and,
and maybe a publicist.
Ooh,
you've changed Sammy.

2646
02:49:27.660 --> 02:49:32.520
Uh,
so I went in and my wife was there and my makeup person wanted to meet him as

2647
02:49:32.521 --> 02:49:35.370
well.
So we're all in there and I just go,
uh,
I'm so sorry to bother you.

2648
02:49:35.371 --> 02:49:36.990
Just want to say I'm a huge fan.
You're a legend.

2649
02:49:37.320 --> 02:49:40.550
Would you mind doing a photo with us?
And he was like,
sure.
Do you state,

2650
02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:44.760
do you still have to point out that you're also on the show or no,
I didn't.

2651
02:49:44.790 --> 02:49:48.980
I don't fuck with Samuel L.
Well,
I would say like what I do is I hae a,

2652
02:49:48.990 --> 02:49:52.230
you're a hue ledges and everything.
Just,
you know,
I'm also on this show.

2653
02:49:52.260 --> 02:49:55.000
I have a funny story about that too.
I know what I,

2654
02:49:55.020 --> 02:49:57.340
what you do is you ask the producer,
does he want,

2655
02:49:57.360 --> 02:50:01.680
does he mind if I come by and today say one of the other guests in Michelle

2656
02:50:01.681 --> 02:50:05.730
wants to say hello typic Oh,
I get hope.
You hope they do.
He doesn't care.

2657
02:50:05.820 --> 02:50:08.760
You know what I mean?
It's like my baby in La,
he doesn't care.

2658
02:50:08.940 --> 02:50:11.460
He just wants to get it done.
Although he didn't have that feeling,

2659
02:50:11.610 --> 02:50:12.570
but then I made the mistake.

2660
02:50:12.571 --> 02:50:16.500
I took my phone out and I handed it Sorta presumptuously too.

2661
02:50:16.501 --> 02:50:19.740
I think his stylist and she looked at me like I was coming back to one.

2662
02:50:20.700 --> 02:50:22.050
She was not the one,

2663
02:50:22.440 --> 02:50:27.440
she was not the one that site that's a looked at this era only knows like if you

2664
02:50:28.231 --> 02:50:30.830
were alive in these 10 years.
That's right.
That's right.

2665
02:50:30.990 --> 02:50:34.290
Don't give me that fucking song.
I had it open.

2666
02:50:34.291 --> 02:50:37.410
It was ready to go in the time it took her to go,

2667
02:50:38.370 --> 02:50:42.330
she could have done it and Jay was like a,
she looked like doctor Ruth.

2668
02:50:42.331 --> 02:50:44.020
It was like an old white woman that was just like,

2669
02:50:47.110 --> 02:50:50.690
like the temperature,
like in the sixth sense when you feel the ghosts,

2670
02:50:51.270 --> 02:50:54.030
I put my hand into cold air and was just like,
Ugh,

2671
02:50:54.040 --> 02:50:57.000
not for you and gave it to somebody else.
But the other,

2672
02:50:57.001 --> 02:51:01.230
the story I had about being on the same show was the first late night I did was

2673
02:51:01.231 --> 02:51:05.700
Jimmy Fallon a way back before he had the tonight try like the first one he did,

2674
02:51:06.030 --> 02:51:09.300
which I remember my manager being like,
you do it when it's a new show.

2675
02:51:09.450 --> 02:51:11.550
They'll remember you when they're a big show now.

2676
02:51:11.551 --> 02:51:16.380
They fucking wild you crazy.
That's how it works.

2677
02:51:16.400 --> 02:51:19.890
Right?
Pete Holmes on me on the show,
check the archives to be,

2678
02:51:19.891 --> 02:51:22.560
help us know who cares.
I'm not saying he should care,

2679
02:51:22.561 --> 02:51:24.780
I'm saying that's a bad posture is logic of course.

2680
02:51:24.810 --> 02:51:27.870
So I did it and I was so thrilled.
My first late night and green day,

2681
02:51:28.080 --> 02:51:30.390
which was one of my favorite,
still is one of my favorite bands.

2682
02:51:30.391 --> 02:51:32.790
But definitely back then it was one of my favorite bands was the,

2683
02:51:32.850 --> 02:51:36.630
was the group and I,
I did my standup and then they played and I was like,

2684
02:51:36.631 --> 02:51:40.670
I wonder,
I wonder if green day,
like I want it to Sam Jackson them.
Right.

2685
02:51:41.610 --> 02:51:44.160
If I were to say anything about my standup,

2686
02:51:44.400 --> 02:51:46.950
and I also just wanted to say it was a fan.
That's true.
But in that order,

2687
02:51:47.250 --> 02:51:52.250
and I went back and I talked to Billy Joe and I just too fucking sentences talk

2688
02:51:53.141 --> 02:51:56.100
to the bass player.
And then I'm like,
I guess they didn't see it.

2689
02:51:56.790 --> 02:52:00.570
Trey called the drummer comes out and he's the only one that like said anything.

2690
02:52:00.571 --> 02:52:02.820
And he goes,
hey,
stick with it.

2691
02:52:06.940 --> 02:52:11.740
I'd rather you upset Nazi.
We were just on the same show.
Stick with it.

2692
02:52:11.741 --> 02:52:13.900
It's like,
keep at it,
keep at it.

2693
02:52:13.901 --> 02:52:17.920
But a fucking girl bears heartbreaker music guy,

2694
02:52:18.580 --> 02:52:22.990
John,
what's his name?
Stamos now his band leader,

2695
02:52:23.110 --> 02:52:27.610
uh,
cold band leader told me small piano this year.
No,

2696
02:52:27.611 --> 02:52:31.910
last year.
He's like,
hey man,
keep doing it.
I was like,
oh my life.
It's like,

2697
02:52:31.930 --> 02:52:36.600
of course guys like,
don't,
yeah,
don't stop man.
You got,

2698
02:52:36.610 --> 02:52:40.330
so I was like,
that's like when Brian Regan would,
he sort of famously,

2699
02:52:40.331 --> 02:52:42.970
occasionally we all bomb a corporate show from time to time.

2700
02:52:43.300 --> 02:52:46.660
It's just what you do,
but you've got a corporate offer and you're just like,

2701
02:52:46.840 --> 02:52:51.340
am I willing to feel like Jon Hamm at the end of the Golden Globe Party for this

2702
02:52:51.341 --> 02:52:52.960
much wedding?
Yeah.
And then you're like,
okay,

2703
02:52:54.180 --> 02:52:56.950
I actually started going to stop saying,
Hey,
I'm,
I'm having a flare up.
Hey,
I'm,

2704
02:52:56.951 --> 02:53:00.280
you're the king handyman hamster man.
I love him.
Anyway.
Uh,

2705
02:53:00.281 --> 02:53:03.340
Brian Regan did a shitty sat at a corporate show cause it was just terrible.

2706
02:53:03.341 --> 02:53:06.610
And somebody afterwards came up and was like,
so what do you do for a living?

2707
02:53:07.240 --> 02:53:11.770
They asked him what he does in that moment.

2708
02:53:11.950 --> 02:53:16.840
If you're Brian Regan,
I bet you're making at least $250,000.

2709
02:53:17.110 --> 02:53:21.160
You want to be like,
I just made 250 k it'd be a,

2710
02:53:21.400 --> 02:53:26.230
if somebody's thinking that would never do,
but I,

2711
02:53:26.260 --> 02:53:30.490
it'd be amazing is if that person asks him that and right then he pulled out the

2712
02:53:30.491 --> 02:53:32.430
check for that Gig.
It was like,
that's what,

2713
02:53:32.860 --> 02:53:36.970
if there's ever a moment that's appropriate because we know,

2714
02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:40.630
Oh God,
Jesus Zang,
Ku chicken

2715
02:53:44.390 --> 02:53:47.800
farting.
That bothers me is that we're doing bits.
We're telling stories.

2716
02:53:47.980 --> 02:53:52.980
The only time I hear Nadave fucking laugh is when you rip one and this is the

2717
02:53:54.731 --> 02:53:59.320
world we live in.
You'll June just so blind siding.
It's hilarious.

2718
02:54:01.390 --> 02:54:05.480
Hilarious.
Just farts.
Are you going to sell that microphone on Ebay?

2719
02:54:05.481 --> 02:54:08.830
You can eventually,
but it's going to be a six figure starting bid for sure.

2720
02:54:08.890 --> 02:54:12.130
In Japan you'd be able to buy a fart and microphone in a vending machine.

2721
02:54:12.410 --> 02:54:14.480
Your ramen use parents

2722
02:54:17.860 --> 02:54:22.360
who farted in the WHO farted.
So wait,
you were saying before though,

2723
02:54:22.390 --> 02:54:27.370
you said that you would almost tell your manager now like it,
dude.

2724
02:54:28.720 --> 02:54:31.870
Oh yeah.
Before the first farm.
For the first part it was interesting to me.

2725
02:54:33.640 --> 02:54:34.840
You're blaming me is the,

2726
02:54:34.890 --> 02:54:39.390
I have any control over when the farmer insisted on the farm.
I did,

2727
02:54:39.430 --> 02:54:44.250
but for good reason.
People enjoy.
Dov loves it.

2728
02:54:44.350 --> 02:54:47.800
The Dov clearly loves it.
I'm sorry Pete.
I can't control when the

2729
02:54:49.610 --> 02:54:52.120
interview and I seem to recall no farts.

2730
02:54:52.330 --> 02:54:55.480
He would have been able to tell you what's wrong with you.
It's true.

2731
02:54:57.100 --> 02:55:01.840
We had hummus and for lunch,
so gross.
So gross.

2732
02:55:01.900 --> 02:55:05.930
I'm not a like no judgment,
but like no judgment.

2733
02:55:08.920 --> 02:55:12.860
No judgment.
It's heavy.
Yeah.
It's like no offense,

2734
02:55:13.980 --> 02:55:15.770
judgment coming.
Can I be honest with you?

2735
02:55:15.771 --> 02:55:20.440
I'm not the type of person who usually says this far in front of your spouse.

2736
02:55:21.110 --> 02:55:23.930
In fact,
no,
of course they do.
What are you crazy

2737
02:55:30.290 --> 02:55:31.123
green and

2738
02:55:34.630 --> 02:55:35.910
he's dragging your shoulder.

2739
02:55:37.190 --> 02:55:41.800
You can't have comedians on that audience for clown,

2740
02:55:41.870 --> 02:55:45.890
for a street performer.
Clown from Montreal in the booth

2741
02:55:49.670 --> 02:55:53.570
we meet someone with better humor,
sense of humor.

2742
02:55:54.830 --> 02:55:57.830
Then blue band get something good,
knows what's good.

2743
02:56:00.380 --> 02:56:02.870
I don't remember what I was saying about managers and you just said though,

2744
02:56:02.871 --> 02:56:05.060
I was saying at this point it feels antiquated.

2745
02:56:06.350 --> 02:56:09.950
Idea of meeting a guy who can plug you into things.
It's a bee.

2746
02:56:09.951 --> 02:56:11.180
It's actually a beautiful thing.

2747
02:56:11.181 --> 02:56:13.850
We can frame it negatively and say managers are irrelevant.

2748
02:56:13.851 --> 02:56:16.670
I actually really love my manager.
I like working with my manager a long time.

2749
02:56:16.670 --> 02:56:18.560
You've been together?
Yeah,
over a decade.
So I want to,

2750
02:56:18.561 --> 02:56:21.890
I'm going to say it with my manager.
I really love my manager.
That being said,

2751
02:56:21.891 --> 02:56:26.720
so taking my manager out of it,
it's not,
you can,
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

2752
02:56:26.750 --> 02:56:30.770
You can chance the rapper this shit.
Like you're at the store,

2753
02:56:30.771 --> 02:56:33.050
you're at the store.
Dalea is that the story?
You know what I mean?

2754
02:56:33.230 --> 02:56:37.250
If you're getting even those early guys that get like the open spots,

2755
02:56:37.251 --> 02:56:41.210
like so newer guys still have access to the same people.
That's true.
Be Funny.

2756
02:56:41.420 --> 02:56:42.410
Don't be a dick.

2757
02:56:42.530 --> 02:56:46.400
Talk to people that you could get on some shows without someone being like,
look,

2758
02:56:46.430 --> 02:56:50.930
I know like who the fuck?
Who Cares?
That's sure.
Different world.
Yeah.

2759
02:56:50.931 --> 02:56:53.780
And then what happens is that's what they sell,
right?
They sell the access.

2760
02:56:53.810 --> 02:56:54.800
I mean essentially.

2761
02:56:55.160 --> 02:57:00.160
And then the access sort of comes in like connected to being really funny,

2762
02:57:00.740 --> 02:57:01.573
right?
Why?

2763
02:57:01.580 --> 02:57:06.290
Ray Romano rather is intro to a book that I love the Intro,

2764
02:57:06.320 --> 02:57:09.350
the book was called how to be a working comic.
Did you guys read that?
No,

2765
02:57:10.580 --> 02:57:15.470
he wrote a book called how to be a world known intro.
Old Gas.
He was listening

2766
02:57:19.090 --> 02:57:23.000
anyway.
I'm actually going to be all right.

2767
02:57:23.120 --> 02:57:25.850
Jesus saying so wait,
so what was it?
What you saying that the cough,

2768
02:57:25.851 --> 02:57:30.260
my toddler age.
Oh my God.

2769
02:57:30.620 --> 02:57:33.500
He said,
uh,
it's the best anti intro.

2770
02:57:33.501 --> 02:57:36.200
It's like in the intro that negates the need to read the book.

2771
02:57:36.470 --> 02:57:41.090
He's basically saying in code like don't read this book.
Just be funny.
Right?

2772
02:57:41.300 --> 02:57:45.110
And like what bird told me when I was starting out,
which was really helpful.

2773
02:57:45.111 --> 02:57:48.770
It was like don't be a Dick and be funny.
Those two things together,

2774
02:57:49.190 --> 02:57:53.630
really great combo.
Really,
really great combo.
If you want to like,
you know,

2775
02:57:54.080 --> 02:57:55.670
what do you need?
What do you need to do these days?

2776
02:57:55.800 --> 02:57:59.420
I've got a couple of people to like you and then they help you.
If I,

2777
02:57:59.421 --> 02:58:02.130
if I had a new comic that I loved,
you'd be like,
Tom,

2778
02:58:02.131 --> 02:58:04.470
check this guy out whether you did or not,
but you do it five times.

2779
02:58:04.470 --> 02:58:06.540
One of them in my work.
That's true.
And that's one of the things,

2780
02:58:06.541 --> 02:58:08.100
I'm not just saying this to promote the show,

2781
02:58:08.340 --> 02:58:11.550
it's one of the things crashing is about we smashing on showtime,

2782
02:58:11.560 --> 02:58:13.620
smashing on showtime.
Then we get a Lotta,

2783
02:58:13.650 --> 02:58:16.500
sometimes they get shit where people are like do comics help each other?

2784
02:58:16.501 --> 02:58:19.470
Like they call bullshit on the idea that comics help each other.

2785
02:58:19.770 --> 02:58:24.120
And I'm like if you're a comic and the people around you aren't helpful or at

2786
02:58:24.121 --> 02:58:27.670
least open,
people just hit,
you're hanging out with the wrong ones.
Very good.

2787
02:58:27.810 --> 02:58:30.780
You know what I mean?
I understand that that might be your reality.

2788
02:58:30.960 --> 02:58:34.960
They all want to fucking see me fail one guy,
like not again,

2789
02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.110
my premise is one guy had called me,

2790
02:58:37.111 --> 02:58:40.390
he was pretending he was drunk and the audience,
I was like bad group.
Yeah,

2791
02:58:40.680 --> 02:58:43.740
you gotta fucking the people around you.
That's your,

2792
02:58:43.860 --> 02:58:47.070
so there's your class that's like the,
the group that you started with.

2793
02:58:47.190 --> 02:58:50.190
But then there's these microclimates inside.
I'm mixing metaphors,

2794
02:58:50.191 --> 02:58:52.980
but you know what I mean?
And with me it was a bunch of Sweetie putties.

2795
02:58:52.981 --> 02:58:57.300
It was me and Kumail and Malaney.
We were supportive and good people.

2796
02:58:57.380 --> 02:58:58.171
But not only that,

2797
02:58:58.171 --> 02:59:03.171
when the premise of the show of crashing is based on a real time in your life

2798
02:59:03.480 --> 02:59:07.890
and weren't some comics obviously really good to you.
Yes.
To inspire that.
Like,

2799
02:59:07.920 --> 02:59:09.990
I mean the people that were ahead of you,
you know what I mean?

2800
02:59:10.170 --> 02:59:14.400
They absolutely and,
and you know,
that's that that spirit continues.

2801
02:59:14.401 --> 02:59:16.590
I still see that when my wife in real life.

2802
02:59:16.591 --> 02:59:19.980
So Christian college going to be a youth pastor ended up getting married when I

2803
02:59:19.981 --> 02:59:24.270
was 22 my wife leaves me when I was 28 when people call me a cock online.

2804
02:59:24.300 --> 02:59:27.900
I'm like literally true.
I am a cuckold.

2805
02:59:28.220 --> 02:59:30.990
Like if my wife left me,
I'm a cock.
Really?

2806
02:59:31.020 --> 02:59:34.290
That's what a caucus that's like literally that's what it got cold is.
Yeah.

2807
02:59:34.291 --> 02:59:36.420
Back in the old days,
you'd write a big wheel bicycle.

2808
02:59:37.050 --> 02:59:41.390
You'd have a very light styrofoam,
had golf.
She leave your hand,
Mike.

2809
02:59:41.400 --> 02:59:44.700
He's a cuckold leaves you at now?
It's like a,
you know,

2810
02:59:44.701 --> 02:59:48.810
I mean you're 28 at the time I was 28 and she's the only person I had ever had

2811
02:59:48.811 --> 02:59:49.071
texts.

2812
02:59:49.071 --> 02:59:53.250
The only person I had ever dated and I married her very standard cause I wasn't

2813
02:59:53.251 --> 02:59:55.080
going to have sex with somebody and not married though.

2814
02:59:55.410 --> 02:59:57.930
We did have sex before marriage,
but then we stopped.

2815
02:59:57.990 --> 02:59:59.460
That's the most Christian thing.
I can't tell you

2816
03:00:01.290 --> 03:00:02.730
until you got married and then we were like,

2817
03:00:02.731 --> 03:00:05.450
let's pick it up again when we get to that feel okay to you.

2818
03:00:05.460 --> 03:00:08.220
Does that feel right?
You know,
you still feel guilty though.

2819
03:00:08.460 --> 03:00:09.770
I didn't feel that bad about it.
I,

2820
03:00:09.771 --> 03:00:11.790
I felt like that was kind of the best of both worlds.

2821
03:00:11.820 --> 03:00:14.970
There were a lot of people that were like dry humping is huge in the Christian

2822
03:00:14.971 --> 03:00:19.890
community when tears moist sound thing,
that's where you dry hump naked.

2823
03:00:19.891 --> 03:00:23.750
As long as the way you try naked,
it's moist.

2824
03:00:24.970 --> 03:00:29.760
Anything in any long as the hot dog doesn't get enveloped by the button
entirely,

2825
03:00:29.761 --> 03:00:32.310
you're still a virgin.
And then there were the Christians,
they would have,

2826
03:00:32.311 --> 03:00:36.090
what do you call them?
Sex,
moist hump,
I call it that.

2827
03:00:36.120 --> 03:00:39.960
I don't know anybody rubbed the outside of it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow.

2828
03:00:39.990 --> 03:00:41.340
We were all still slipping in.

2829
03:00:41.370 --> 03:00:43.440
There's never been a group Hornier than Christians,

2830
03:00:43.441 --> 03:00:47.730
and I would argue that Christians have some of the best sex of any group is

2831
03:00:47.731 --> 03:00:50.370
because we think we're going to help for it.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

2832
03:00:50.371 --> 03:00:54.030
It's romantic.
It's like a romance novel where it's like,
all right,

2833
03:00:54.031 --> 03:00:56.630
we'll risk the flames for this.

2834
03:00:58.820 --> 03:01:01.680
Oh my God.
What do you feel like it's over and you got away with it.
Yeah.

2835
03:01:01.690 --> 03:01:03.340
Rush the adrenaline.
No,
I would.

2836
03:01:03.400 --> 03:01:05.680
I would wager that we're having some pretty good sense,

2837
03:01:05.700 --> 03:01:10.660
especially with that early guilties.
Oh my God.

2838
03:01:11.590 --> 03:01:16.420
So then I married her and then she left me and then that's where crashing sort

2839
03:01:16.421 --> 03:01:18.470
of picks up is that like I,

2840
03:01:18.870 --> 03:01:22.390
I really did kind of fall into stand up.
I was doing stand up.

2841
03:01:22.510 --> 03:01:24.340
This isn't real life because you can stand up,

2842
03:01:24.520 --> 03:01:28.870
but you got way more serious about it.
After I needed the community,

2843
03:01:28.871 --> 03:01:33.400
I needed the friends and Malaney and croll.
Uh,
we're like really sweet,

2844
03:01:33.401 --> 03:01:37.600
dear people to meet Tj.
Really cool male and you're,
but you're like new.

2845
03:01:37.601 --> 03:01:38.770
Then when this is happening,

2846
03:01:38.920 --> 03:01:41.830
we exaggerated how new I am for crashing to make it better.

2847
03:01:42.190 --> 03:01:44.680
I was a little bit more established but at the time she had left me,

2848
03:01:44.681 --> 03:01:47.290
I had been on TV and stuff,
but that's not like a great,

2849
03:01:47.730 --> 03:01:50.740
what what did happen was I wasn't really making a ton of money and then she and

2850
03:01:50.741 --> 03:01:55.240
I split,
right.
Cause we didn't Acca did you guys do Naca now?
But I remember,

2851
03:01:55.740 --> 03:01:59.110
I remember,
you know I was submitting to,

2852
03:01:59.111 --> 03:02:02.080
I used to submit and I get in and all that stuff.
People like to talk about it.

2853
03:02:02.081 --> 03:02:05.110
Like if you go your whole life,
it's crazy.

2854
03:02:05.111 --> 03:02:08.080
Isn't it funny how in Showbiz sometimes you look back on things that would have

2855
03:02:08.081 --> 03:02:11.680
been the biggest break of your life and you're like,
that sounds like torture.

2856
03:02:12.130 --> 03:02:12.963
Horrible.
They're like,

2857
03:02:13.150 --> 03:02:18.150
you can do 28 schools in Iowa tomorrow and we'll string them together.

2858
03:02:19.121 --> 03:02:24.121
So you're on the road for six months and you'll come back with 5,800 pounds

2859
03:02:26.380 --> 03:02:29.260
and you're just like,
now I would be like,
that's,
that's a death sentence.

2860
03:02:29.261 --> 03:02:31.540
I can't live in a holiday inn.
Express

2861
03:02:33.930 --> 03:02:37.240
relevant shit.
What's that?
Do any of your material that you normally do?

2862
03:02:37.241 --> 03:02:39.880
Like you can't be dirty.
That's right.
You can't do anything.

2863
03:02:39.910 --> 03:02:43.810
Luckily I didn't have anything dirty,
political or sexual,

2864
03:02:43.811 --> 03:02:46.480
so I was perfect.
I was,
what's your household?

2865
03:02:46.481 --> 03:02:49.120
Super Christian then it was like growing up.
I took it.

2866
03:02:49.121 --> 03:02:52.300
I took it harder than my parents.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's unique.

2867
03:02:52.330 --> 03:02:55.390
My father to this day,
ends phone calls with me by saying,

2868
03:02:55.391 --> 03:02:58.750
keep in touch with yourself and don't let your meat loaf.

2869
03:02:58.810 --> 03:03:02.730
He loves saying those two phrases,
which are both like jerk off.
Be Sure,

2870
03:03:03.280 --> 03:03:05.120
make sure you're having lots of sex.

2871
03:03:06.030 --> 03:03:08.590
And it always asks me if I had sunk the Bismarck yet,

2872
03:03:08.680 --> 03:03:11.620
which is a submarine in World War Two,
which means have sex.

2873
03:03:11.770 --> 03:03:15.760
So they were surprisingly normal.
So when I went to church,

2874
03:03:15.761 --> 03:03:20.761
like grownups in Khakis with keys and wallets told me that you'd go to hell.

2875
03:03:20.981 --> 03:03:24.310
And I was like,
guys,
you got to shut the fuck up and listen to Dan over here.

2876
03:03:24.310 --> 03:03:27.190
Like I just believed growing up.
So I was like,
Hey,

2877
03:03:27.191 --> 03:03:30.010
he just said he knows the secrets of the universe.
Why would he lie?

2878
03:03:30.250 --> 03:03:34.060
And your parents were like,
no,
it's not that serious.
Well,
I was,

2879
03:03:34.360 --> 03:03:37.960
I got more of that at church.
You know what I mean?
You didn't talk about it.

2880
03:03:38.530 --> 03:03:42.550
And they went,
you know what I mean?
It's like we all went,
but I listened.
Yeah.

2881
03:03:42.551 --> 03:03:46.110
But that's interesting.
The grownups know how to go to church and be like,
yeah,

2882
03:03:46.111 --> 03:03:48.790
you're say that when you're there.
But kids are like,

2883
03:03:49.150 --> 03:03:53.290
now these grownups and the nice sweet grownups,
you know,

2884
03:03:53.910 --> 03:03:57.320
household was pretty tumultuous,
not like horrible,
but your shit is your shit.

2885
03:03:57.470 --> 03:03:58.130
My parents didn't

2886
03:03:58.130 --> 03:03:59.900
<v 20>like each other and they're fighting a lot and stuff.</v>

2887
03:03:59.930 --> 03:04:03.530
So then you go to church and like the nicest grownups,
you know,
like these new,

2888
03:04:03.531 --> 03:04:07.970
like father figures of other figures are like wearing nice suits and giving you

2889
03:04:07.971 --> 03:04:10.720
cookies and lunch.
They're just like,
hey,
you know,
uh,

2890
03:04:10.820 --> 03:04:14.390
don't you want to go to happen?
And you're like,
yeah,
so like I the,
you know,

2891
03:04:14.420 --> 03:04:16.760
if it's a hook,
the hook was put in me way deeper.

2892
03:04:16.910 --> 03:04:19.230
My brother was older so he was just like,

2893
03:04:19.240 --> 03:04:23.030
he was already having sex and doing drugs and seven he was just this fucking
sex.

2894
03:04:23.150 --> 03:04:26.070
So like it just like took to me was he like Pete,

2895
03:04:26.071 --> 03:04:27.080
what the fuck is wrong with you?

2896
03:04:27.170 --> 03:04:30.530
I W he kind of regrets that actually cause I'm crashing.

2897
03:04:30.560 --> 03:04:34.130
Like my character talks about real things like worrying that Jesus,

2898
03:04:34.131 --> 03:04:37.130
we're going to come back because you know a Christian belief is that Jesus is

2899
03:04:37.131 --> 03:04:39.140
coming back at some point,
the second coming.

2900
03:04:39.440 --> 03:04:43.160
And I used to worry that Jesus would return while I was masturbating,

2901
03:04:43.310 --> 03:04:47.060
which obviously is funny,
but it's not really funny if you think about it,

2902
03:04:47.061 --> 03:04:48.200
it's not really funny.

2903
03:04:48.500 --> 03:04:52.700
Like you're masturbating so you have this like irrepressible urge and it's

2904
03:04:52.701 --> 03:04:56.090
totally normal.
Yeah.
Not only are you kind of like guilty about it,

2905
03:04:56.091 --> 03:04:59.930
but you're also worried that Jesus might come out on a golden cheap,

2906
03:04:59.931 --> 03:05:03.080
like the car,
just like I'm here to take you home.

2907
03:05:03.110 --> 03:05:06.560
What are you doing?
You know,
like,
and you go to hell.

2908
03:05:07.160 --> 03:05:10.190
So I think that's really funny because I made my peace with that,

2909
03:05:10.370 --> 03:05:13.310
but my brother will watch crashing and he'll call me and he'll be like,

2910
03:05:13.340 --> 03:05:17.780
I'm so sorry.
I feel badly.
He feels like I was abused and he was just like,

2911
03:05:17.781 --> 03:05:21.320
I didn't know my little brother was in the bedroom next door,

2912
03:05:21.321 --> 03:05:26.060
like thinking he was [inaudible] to hell.
But I actually,
I,

2913
03:05:27.030 --> 03:05:31.300
yeah,
sorry.
I actually think it's really funny man.

2914
03:05:31.400 --> 03:05:33.230
I've had enough distance to be like,

2915
03:05:33.231 --> 03:05:37.370
to be masturbating and looking at the clouds.
So like just give me five minutes.

2916
03:05:37.790 --> 03:05:42.380
Yeah,
he always did Jesus a lot,
you know?

2917
03:05:42.420 --> 03:05:43.800
Well it's a scary idea,
you know,

2918
03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:47.660
it depends on how he's one second one sex and just doesn't go well with it.

2919
03:05:47.750 --> 03:05:50.120
Like a,
you know,
pretty Christian upbringing.

2920
03:05:50.150 --> 03:05:53.630
Like I had pretty Catholic parents and yeah.
You know,

2921
03:05:53.660 --> 03:05:58.550
you start to definitely feel like this is a bad thing.
Sexual thoughts,

2922
03:05:58.551 --> 03:05:59.930
sexual feeling.
My father,

2923
03:05:59.931 --> 03:06:03.950
which we'll ask mom and my dad were Catholic and they gave me a little bit of

2924
03:06:03.951 --> 03:06:08.510
that Catholic guilt.
I think that's why,
I'm not to say I'm grateful for it,

2925
03:06:08.511 --> 03:06:10.970
but like it almost makes us funnier.

2926
03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:15.110
That's one of the things that we deal with on crashing as well as like already

2927
03:06:15.111 --> 03:06:20.050
obviously already as like he's got a lot of demons and he's so funny.

2928
03:06:20.120 --> 03:06:23.420
Yeah.
I Sofa and like we had a line,
we ended up cutting it,
but he was like,

2929
03:06:23.660 --> 03:06:26.960
he was like,
now you're,
my wife left me funny.
You know what I mean?

2930
03:06:27.230 --> 03:06:28.610
Richard Pryor was,

2931
03:06:28.611 --> 03:06:33.611
I was raised in a brothel in Peoria and it's not to say that we crave or ask for

2932
03:06:35.211 --> 03:06:35.990
suffering,

2933
03:06:35.990 --> 03:06:40.640
but it is interesting that stand up is one of the fortunate professions.

2934
03:06:40.700 --> 03:06:43.760
Going back to that gratitude that you can alchemize it a little bit.

2935
03:06:44.060 --> 03:06:45.440
We take that weird thing,
I'm,

2936
03:06:45.800 --> 03:06:48.440
I'm jerking off and I'm worried that you'd like to the point of tears,

2937
03:06:48.441 --> 03:06:52.040
like I'm worried that Jesus is going to catch me during up and then you use it

2938
03:06:52.041 --> 03:06:55.670
to make an HBO show that's Fucking,
he's pretty awesome.
That's redemption.

2939
03:06:55.960 --> 03:07:00.960
So redeeming moments also like the highest form of that suffering.

2940
03:07:01.020 --> 03:07:04.110
Turn,
turning it into a piece of,
that's exactly right.
He says,

2941
03:07:04.170 --> 03:07:06.540
you sub domain all the suffering into you.

2942
03:07:06.541 --> 03:07:10.140
We can be doing drugs or gambling or prostituting,

2943
03:07:10.141 --> 03:07:12.820
but instead we tell fart jokes or farm into a microphone.
Right.

2944
03:07:12.830 --> 03:07:14.790
And make millions of people happy.
You could.

2945
03:07:14.910 --> 03:07:18.960
You could and a lot of us do in my heartbreaks is you can fold into yourself.

2946
03:07:19.380 --> 03:07:21.840
We're all in this together and that's one of the reasons the show is called

2947
03:07:21.841 --> 03:07:24.330
crashing.
Not to make this to afterschool especially,

2948
03:07:24.331 --> 03:07:27.810
I'm just saying the idea of crashing is if you're trying to be a comedian or

2949
03:07:27.811 --> 03:07:30.450
doing anything that's different or interesting,

2950
03:07:30.451 --> 03:07:33.990
where in your heart to do it's a dream.
If it sucks,

2951
03:07:34.050 --> 03:07:36.690
Marina Franklin says this and my character in the first season,
she goes,

2952
03:07:36.920 --> 03:07:39.090
if it sucks,
that's how you know you're doing it.
Right.

2953
03:07:39.270 --> 03:07:42.030
That's why we tell the story about Naca trying to book colleges.

2954
03:07:42.031 --> 03:07:45.300
That's why he's telling a story about [inaudible] offering warm up or a barking,

2955
03:07:45.301 --> 03:07:48.870
handing out flyers because I want every comedian out there to watch it and go,

2956
03:07:49.050 --> 03:07:50.160
oh good.

2957
03:07:50.190 --> 03:07:53.850
Because when I met like I would be barking and fucking Demitri Martin would come

2958
03:07:53.851 --> 03:07:56.850
by and be like,
I barked for the Boston too and you're just like,

2959
03:07:56.880 --> 03:08:01.170
it might as well have been cocaine.
He might as well have given me cocaine.

2960
03:08:01.200 --> 03:08:02.490
That's what it is.
I was just like,

2961
03:08:02.491 --> 03:08:04.920
my feet weren't touching the ground for the rest of the day.

2962
03:08:05.010 --> 03:08:08.490
When Jim Gaffigan told me I started the Boston and is that place still a shit

2963
03:08:08.491 --> 03:08:11.370
hole?
And you're like,
yeah.
He's like,
yeah,
it's kind of good.

2964
03:08:11.371 --> 03:08:14.220
You want to start where no one's going to see you anyway and you're just like,

2965
03:08:14.460 --> 03:08:16.590
oh fuck.
Yeah,
you just that little moment,

2966
03:08:16.740 --> 03:08:20.430
just a little moment of of grants and that and that sort of stuff would happen

2967
03:08:20.431 --> 03:08:22.530
all the time.
And that's kind of one of the things.

2968
03:08:22.560 --> 03:08:25.080
Obviously we want the shed to be super funny and interesting,

2969
03:08:25.200 --> 03:08:27.770
but there is something in there that's hopeful that you,

2970
03:08:27.840 --> 03:08:29.220
and it doesn't have to be a comedian.

2971
03:08:29.700 --> 03:08:34.700
I think comedian is a great catchall for like a dream because it just means you

2972
03:08:35.341 --> 03:08:37.520
want who you are to be accepted.
Yeah.

2973
03:08:37.710 --> 03:08:41.430
Architects also want their thoughts to be accepted,

2974
03:08:41.580 --> 03:08:44.280
but we have the added benefit that we can be really funny.
That's true.

2975
03:08:44.310 --> 03:08:44.761
By the way.

2976
03:08:44.761 --> 03:08:49.761
Speaking of the show and then poor already always thinking about them and

2977
03:08:50.131 --> 03:08:53.160
wondering is do you know anything about him?
Is He,
oh,
I don't know.

2978
03:08:53.161 --> 03:08:56.730
I mean I saw the photos of a,
of his nose and I would say this if he was here,

2979
03:08:56.760 --> 03:08:59.640
you know,
we're obviously,
we're show brothers and I love the guy,

2980
03:09:00.150 --> 03:09:02.160
but I was watching it last night and I was like,
man,

2981
03:09:02.161 --> 03:09:05.070
we thought his nose was bad on the,
on the show.

2982
03:09:05.310 --> 03:09:09.360
And then unfortunately it got worse.
But is he in Rehab right now?
We're in jail.

2983
03:09:09.361 --> 03:09:14.010
I think he got out of Rehab and he apparently he's not.
He's not on heroin.

2984
03:09:14.011 --> 03:09:17.800
That's,
that's what that's good is that I think he's passing his pee pee test.

2985
03:09:17.940 --> 03:09:21.350
I'm not really the authority.
No,
no,
no.
I just had a quick thought.
Oh,

2986
03:09:21.570 --> 03:09:24.420
I don't mind talking about it.
I just want to be clear.
Anyone listening,

2987
03:09:24.421 --> 03:09:27.840
this is not like from the source,
right,
right,
right.
We don't,

2988
03:09:27.841 --> 03:09:32.220
when I do talk to rd,
we don't talk.
It's very hard to talk about that stuff.
We,

2989
03:09:32.221 --> 03:09:34.740
you can you talk about it without talking about,
and you're like already,
please,

2990
03:09:34.970 --> 03:09:38.630
uh,
we love you.
Please take care of yourself and you still love to,

2991
03:09:38.640 --> 03:09:43.110
he's so beloved by,
it's crazy.
I had fans,
I can't,

2992
03:09:43.140 --> 03:09:45.680
whenever we tweet a preview or something,
uh,

2993
03:09:45.681 --> 03:09:48.540
of crashing like a 15 second thing and he's in it,

2994
03:09:48.900 --> 03:09:50.730
he's in the 15 second preview.

2995
03:09:51.120 --> 03:09:54.790
All my Twitter's just clogged with these loyal fans that he's like,
where's Adi?

2996
03:09:54.940 --> 03:09:59.010
Morati.
Yeah.
More fucking rd.
Yeah.
This show sucks.
Except for I

2997
03:10:00.710 --> 03:10:04.810
love,
I love him.
And,
and,
and it's hard not to love him,

2998
03:10:04.811 --> 03:10:09.520
but he's so,
so,
so funny.
He rifts so many of the great things he said.

2999
03:10:09.670 --> 03:10:13.000
I think one of the reasons the show got picked up was because already rift this

3000
03:10:13.001 --> 03:10:16.840
whole monologue in the scene where he's just talking about struggling with

3001
03:10:16.841 --> 03:10:19.000
addiction and kind of like what we were talking about,

3002
03:10:19.001 --> 03:10:20.950
like mad TV and getting there,

3003
03:10:20.951 --> 03:10:25.951
but feeling empty and all that sort of golden globe feeling and going to drugs

3004
03:10:25.991 --> 03:10:30.220
and really struggling.
I mean it's,
it's,
so when I had,
I had doctor drew,

3005
03:10:30.250 --> 03:10:34.090
you guys had doctor drew on a couple of times.
I told him,

3006
03:10:34.570 --> 03:10:39.490
I've never been more sure in my life than addiction.
That addiction is a disease.

3007
03:10:39.820 --> 03:10:42.700
You know what I mean?
It's,
it's not,
I know,
I know you know that,

3008
03:10:42.701 --> 03:10:46.570
but then you're like,
oh,
nobody wants to stop more than rd.
Yeah,
he's got it.
Yeah.

3009
03:10:46.571 --> 03:10:49.770
He wants it,
but it's not a here.
Right.
Something going on

3010
03:10:49.830 --> 03:10:54.300
<v 5>going on inside of them.
How well versed,
because you,
you,
you know,</v>

3011
03:10:54.301 --> 03:10:57.780
you took,
took to the Christian upbringing and then you,

3012
03:10:57.870 --> 03:11:02.710
you went to a Christian college.
How were well versed,
are you in,
you know,

3013
03:11:02.730 --> 03:11:05.010
the Bible and Christianity and,
Oh,
are you,

3014
03:11:05.510 --> 03:11:10.210
<v 20>I,
I,
you know,
that's interesting.
Compared to some,
not,
not great compared to most.</v>

3015
03:11:10.600 --> 03:11:14.960
Pretty Great.
Pretty Great.
So I wanted to get your take on these um,

3016
03:11:15.400 --> 03:11:19.400
Christian jokes.
You know,
it just tell me heart,
this is breaking away.

3017
03:11:19.980 --> 03:11:24.050
I just want to know.
I W I will to Senate,
you know,

3018
03:11:24.780 --> 03:11:26.770
these references like weather,

3019
03:11:27.100 --> 03:11:30.670
would this be funny to college peak and help out it.

3020
03:11:30.671 --> 03:11:34.960
Season three of crashing is about my character joining the Christian comedy
tour,

3021
03:11:35.170 --> 03:11:39.750
which is something that I've done comedy show and yeah,
it's an interesting mark.

3022
03:11:39.760 --> 03:11:41.860
I one time got in trouble for saying sob,

3023
03:11:42.580 --> 03:11:45.450
which isn't this where it's an acronym representing swear

3024
03:11:46.180 --> 03:11:50.590
<v 5>presented a represented,
I got reprimanded for saying penis.
Yeah.</v>

3025
03:11:50.890 --> 03:11:53.740
And I wasn't saying like suck it.

3026
03:11:53.800 --> 03:11:58.030
I was just just like saying that you know someone's penis.

3027
03:11:58.420 --> 03:12:02.290
And then I got off stage,
this was at a juniors in Erie,

3028
03:12:02.291 --> 03:12:05.410
Pennsylvania and the woman who had bought the club was like,

3029
03:12:05.430 --> 03:12:07.540
I only like clean comedy.
So when you get booked they're like,

3030
03:12:07.541 --> 03:12:10.450
can you do a clean set?
And I looked at it like,
hey,

3031
03:12:10.451 --> 03:12:12.850
I need the work and kind of a challenge.

3032
03:12:12.851 --> 03:12:17.830
So I just literally made the 45 to 60 minutes work like that.

3033
03:12:17.860 --> 03:12:19.660
Yeah,
and she was like,
you said,
penis up there.
I was like,

3034
03:12:19.661 --> 03:12:21.790
are you seriously busting my chops?

3035
03:12:22.320 --> 03:12:24.810
<v 20>Even before I watched this?
It,
it just sort of,</v>

3036
03:12:25.480 --> 03:12:29.310
it just sort of breaks my heart that there is Christian music,

3037
03:12:29.311 --> 03:12:33.330
that there is Christian comedy that we that because as somebody that used to be

3038
03:12:33.331 --> 03:12:37.350
in that world,
it just hurts me that we're like,
we're not in it.

3039
03:12:37.410 --> 03:12:41.190
Like we're not feeling what you guys are feeling.
You know what I mean?

3040
03:12:41.480 --> 03:12:46.020
Like segregate
this guy.

3041
03:12:46.021 --> 03:12:48.840
I don't know this guy,
he has the same complex emotions.

3042
03:12:49.410 --> 03:12:52.700
Like there's a burden to my people.
I still consider them might people.

3043
03:12:52.701 --> 03:12:55.520
It's like you're not allowed to express your doubt.

3044
03:12:55.550 --> 03:12:57.380
You're not allowed to express your anger.

3045
03:12:57.830 --> 03:13:01.250
You're not allowed to express your child ugliness.
You know what I'm saying?

3046
03:13:01.251 --> 03:13:04.070
You got to always put on that face.
Jealousy.
That's what I mean.

3047
03:13:04.071 --> 03:13:06.820
And that is not as,
as I interpreted it,

3048
03:13:07.130 --> 03:13:09.320
and I don't think that's really much up for debate.

3049
03:13:09.470 --> 03:13:10.880
That's not the message of Christ,

3050
03:13:10.881 --> 03:13:15.881
that authenticity and realness and truth and the light is like the fucking

3051
03:13:16.491 --> 03:13:20.970
point.
So when I see us going like,
well a lot of times Christian,

3052
03:13:21.140 --> 03:13:23.120
this is maybe is better before I do this.

3053
03:13:23.390 --> 03:13:28.010
We're trying to represent holiness.
Like I think if you are holy,

3054
03:13:28.070 --> 03:13:32.900
like if you connect into the infinite consciousness that erupted into the big

3055
03:13:32.901 --> 03:13:36.110
bang and made everything,
if you can get into that feeling of oneness,

3056
03:13:36.260 --> 03:13:41.030
chances are you probably are pretty economists,
gentle,
nice patient,

3057
03:13:41.120 --> 03:13:42.740
not very horny.
You know,

3058
03:13:42.741 --> 03:13:46.640
prison not having 12 Michelob ultras Kinda guy.

3059
03:13:47.180 --> 03:13:49.540
You know what I'm saying?
Like we're not watching it hardcore.

3060
03:13:49.550 --> 03:13:51.020
We're not reading barely legal,

3061
03:13:51.940 --> 03:13:56.240
but that that comes a crafter.
The inner transformation show.

3062
03:13:56.390 --> 03:13:59.690
My people and I used to do this,
go,
oh,

3063
03:13:59.691 --> 03:14:02.120
I see the fruit of the inner transformation.

3064
03:14:02.270 --> 03:14:05.570
So I'll pretend that I have it.
That trust,

3065
03:14:05.630 --> 03:14:09.020
because that's all that matters is I just want to be in the group so I don't

3066
03:14:09.021 --> 03:14:13.620
swear.
Bump up again.
You bump up against what you,

3067
03:14:13.680 --> 03:14:15.920
when you're not in that group and you meet that person,

3068
03:14:16.220 --> 03:14:20.750
you bump up against what you perceive as this,
the phoniness.

3069
03:14:20.770 --> 03:14:21.490
That's what you,

3070
03:14:21.490 --> 03:14:25.310
you go like you're putting on something here and I want to be in that you don't

3071
03:14:25.311 --> 03:14:29.120
express any doubt and that you have all the answers and it feels like it's it's

3072
03:14:29.121 --> 03:14:32.240
cart before the horse and I sympathize.

3073
03:14:32.241 --> 03:14:35.510
I'm not saying are a bunch of holy,
a phony holy people.

3074
03:14:35.750 --> 03:14:38.240
I'm saying when I was in that church,

3075
03:14:38.570 --> 03:14:43.570
I felt it and saw the need to do it because there wasn't land,

3076
03:14:44.390 --> 03:14:47.750
there wasn't freedom,
there wasn't room for your doubt.

3077
03:14:47.751 --> 03:14:51.000
They might say like your doubts are welcome now they're fucking not.

3078
03:14:51.001 --> 03:14:56.001
They're not and neither is like my alcoholism or my drug addiction or my porn

3079
03:14:56.031 --> 03:14:58.010
addiction.
It's not.
We all like,

3080
03:14:58.040 --> 03:15:01.250
you know when youth pastors would take back in the day before the Internet would

3081
03:15:01.251 --> 03:15:04.910
go for a conference that take over a whole like a holiday inn.

3082
03:15:05.120 --> 03:15:08.540
The porn like ordering went back when he had to order porn,

3083
03:15:08.750 --> 03:15:11.600
but like times 10 of course,

3084
03:15:11.750 --> 03:15:14.960
because they're like this very,
I think,
juicy,

3085
03:15:14.961 --> 03:15:19.340
exciting electric alive idea that Jesus was representing,

3086
03:15:19.610 --> 03:15:23.990
got turned into.
Don't jerk off and you know what happens when you do that?

3087
03:15:24.200 --> 03:15:27.710
Porn rates go through the roof when you finally have a weekend away from Helen,

3088
03:15:27.860 --> 03:15:29.870
you're rigid wife.
You know what I'm saying?

3089
03:15:29.960 --> 03:15:33.110
It's sucks that we've lost the narrative.
I didn't come here to preach,

3090
03:15:33.111 --> 03:15:36.440
but anyway,
when we say there's Christian comedy,

3091
03:15:36.441 --> 03:15:41.360
it breaks my heart because I think bill burr is doing comedy.

3092
03:15:41.361 --> 03:15:46.060
That is true and is therefore Christ ish.
You know what I'm saying?

3093
03:15:46.061 --> 03:15:50.040
You're saying it's,
it's,
it's on the side of this is what it's

3094
03:15:50.040 --> 03:15:54.330
<v 19>fucking like to be a human.
It heals us.
It gives us solidarity.</v>

3095
03:15:54.331 --> 03:15:58.470
It makes us feel less alone.
That's so much better than going up and being like,

3096
03:15:58.740 --> 03:16:00.870
you know,
Bathsheba was on the roof.

3097
03:16:01.370 --> 03:16:06.090
I know David Tuck a little peekaboo.
Like who are you helping?
Okay,

3098
03:16:06.110 --> 03:16:09.090
you just did the first pages.
Yeah,
sure I did.
I don't know.
Actually,

3099
03:16:09.400 --> 03:16:12.600
I could tell you some help me.
Let's see what the are.
And by the way,

3100
03:16:12.601 --> 03:16:14.730
my heart is open to this man.
Okay.

3101
03:16:15.710 --> 03:16:17.870
<v 21>What's up strong church,
Chris here.
You know,</v>

3102
03:16:17.871 --> 03:16:20.090
they always say that preacher jokes are the worst.

3103
03:16:20.120 --> 03:16:23.990
So we thought what you put that to the test.
This is the preacher joke challenge.

3104
03:16:24.730 --> 03:16:27.410
<v 19>How do we know that cars are in the New Testament?</v>

3105
03:16:28.700 --> 03:16:33.180
Because Jesus was a car painter.
Carpet.
Can you pause it please?
Yeah,

3106
03:16:33.380 --> 03:16:36.380
yeah.
That's one of the worst jokes I've ever heard.

3107
03:16:37.550 --> 03:16:40.370
That was why.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's,

3108
03:16:41.540 --> 03:16:45.110
it's like forcing,
it's terrible.
Yeah.

3109
03:16:45.111 --> 03:16:47.480
When I went to Disney land and they were,

3110
03:16:47.490 --> 03:16:49.580
when you were waiting in line for like the monsters inc ride,

3111
03:16:49.581 --> 03:16:53.750
they were like write a joke and they'll put it up on the screen.
And I was like,

3112
03:16:53.751 --> 03:16:56.030
uh,
the joke that I wanted to be on the screen and I'm like,

3113
03:16:56.031 --> 03:16:57.350
I'm a professional comedian.
I can do that.
Yeah.

3114
03:16:57.530 --> 03:17:01.430
The joke that I wrote was what do,
uh,
what is Mickey Mouse?

3115
03:17:01.880 --> 03:17:06.680
What happens when Mickey Mouse cries?
Or what does Mickey Mouse cry?

3116
03:17:07.790 --> 03:17:12.710
Mouseketeers that's good.
It's not good.
And I appreciate that.
I also liked it,

3117
03:17:12.980 --> 03:17:16.890
but it's like you're just trying this is that is 10 times better than this shit?

3118
03:17:16.910 --> 03:17:19.780
Yeah.
This is word.
Quite a painter.
A carpenter.

3119
03:17:20.300 --> 03:17:23.600
It's like there was that did somebody did it and I liked the way you said that.

3120
03:17:23.750 --> 03:17:27.770
We just,
just so and like you said it like you were literally upset.

3121
03:17:27.800 --> 03:17:30.200
There was a nickel back parody songs.

3122
03:17:30.201 --> 03:17:33.520
Somebody tried to go weird owl on look at this photograph and they went,

3123
03:17:33.540 --> 03:17:37.560
look at this Frodo graph.
It doesn't sound like photograph.

3124
03:17:37.650 --> 03:17:42.620
I'm out and car painter is not what we say.
No,
fucking get out of here.

3125
03:17:42.740 --> 03:17:45.830
Get out of here.
Let's go to the next.
Appreciate your rage at this now.

3126
03:17:46.630 --> 03:17:49.640
Why didn't know what I have to punish and discipline the chickens on the Ark.

3127
03:17:49.790 --> 03:17:54.290
Hold it.
Hold it.
Hold it by that.
Why did,
no,
I have to punish and discipline.

3128
03:17:55.430 --> 03:17:56.750
Discipline as a clue.
All right.

3129
03:17:57.050 --> 03:18:00.560
The chickens on the Ark because they were clicking around.

3130
03:18:01.760 --> 03:18:06.750
I think you can do that.
That sounds like no,
you're right.
You might be that

3131
03:18:08.250 --> 03:18:11.560
the chickens,
I mean it's going to be the chicken playing about,
yeah,

3132
03:18:12.510 --> 03:18:17.390
it's a bunch of heads.
A badge,
a something with eggs.
Right.

3133
03:18:17.391 --> 03:18:20.780
They were to get to the other side.
No discipline.
They were,

3134
03:18:21.210 --> 03:18:25.790
they were too excited to be on eggs cause they were using foul.

3135
03:18:26.810 --> 03:18:29.900
<v 22>Ah,
I</v>

3136
03:18:29.940 --> 03:18:32.310
<v 19>gotta get him laughing.
Here's the best part.
Yeah.</v>

3137
03:18:32.350 --> 03:18:36.820
This nerd is like foul language.
It's not terrible.

3138
03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:41.500
That one's at least not terrible.
But that last right here is so big,
but I do.

3139
03:18:41.530 --> 03:18:42.890
Yes.
That's big.

3140
03:18:43.000 --> 03:18:47.730
Laugh was too big and the guy's delivery was not very good.
It's deadpan.

3141
03:18:48.110 --> 03:18:49.480
<v 20>This,
what's going on here?</v>

3142
03:18:49.481 --> 03:18:53.650
Just one more little dip into the Pete preaching pool is,
is like,

3143
03:18:54.130 --> 03:18:59.130
what are we saying about a faith for grown intellectual interesting people when

3144
03:18:59.231 --> 03:19:03.070
the jokes that we can appreciate our baby jokes.
Right.
You know what I mean?

3145
03:19:03.310 --> 03:19:05.320
Like we don't understand.
Have you read the Bible?

3146
03:19:05.321 --> 03:19:09.850
If you read the book of job and sit in the complexity and the sex and the

3147
03:19:09.851 --> 03:19:14.590
violence and the doubt and the shame and the fear in that book and that people

3148
03:19:14.591 --> 03:19:17.530
are actually drawn to Jesus.
Do you know Jesus drew a crowd?

3149
03:19:17.680 --> 03:19:20.560
It's like fucking hanging out with Jim Carrey.
Like if you went,

3150
03:19:20.680 --> 03:19:24.150
people came and listened to them.
It's not because he was staying there.

3151
03:19:24.270 --> 03:19:26.970
<v 19>Bow fucking language.
You understand?</v>

3152
03:19:27.120 --> 03:19:32.120
You think you can draw an impromptu crowd back in the day when like 15 feet over

3153
03:19:32.401 --> 03:19:34.760
someone's like just killing a goat for fun.
Like,

3154
03:19:34.800 --> 03:19:38.340
like I had to code like you had medieval shit to get me with.

3155
03:19:38.370 --> 03:19:43.370
People wanted to listen to Jesus and it's become like how many lollipops to goes

3156
03:19:45.100 --> 03:19:50.030
to
like how the fuck did,
wait,

3157
03:19:51.790 --> 03:19:54.430
wait.
Do you guys even a better joke than the car?

3158
03:19:55.190 --> 03:19:57.500
Everything is a better Joe carpet.

3159
03:19:58.170 --> 03:20:02.030
Do you want to guess the joke answer to the,

3160
03:20:02.031 --> 03:20:04.740
how do you make holy water?
How do you make holy water?
First of all,

3161
03:20:04.741 --> 03:20:07.800
let's look at how distant with the hole punch with a way with a hole,

3162
03:20:07.801 --> 03:20:10.950
punch a hole,
punch.
Something about the punch.
Oh,
right.

3163
03:20:11.010 --> 03:20:14.670
But look how disinterested the kid is listening on the left there.

3164
03:20:14.671 --> 03:20:17.580
That's fantastic.
And I was so bored just like,

3165
03:20:17.581 --> 03:20:20.640
God damn this right before you left the church.
They make holy water.

3166
03:20:20.700 --> 03:20:25.300
How do you make wonderful,
oh,

3167
03:20:26.260 --> 03:20:28.380
he's milking it.
Get rid of the water.

3168
03:20:31.080 --> 03:20:35.760
That is not a joke.
Get regular honor and boiled to death.

3169
03:20:35.960 --> 03:20:40.670
Oh,
oh,
oh,
oh

3170
03:20:42.450 --> 03:20:47.340
no.
It's a guy who's excited about a highway.
Wow.
Wow.

3171
03:20:48.040 --> 03:20:52.770
Seriously.
There's wow.
Dilate Trans Canada highway.
I just did a show.

3172
03:20:53.100 --> 03:20:56.100
<v 20>Martha has the show was scientist where he was like,
uh,</v>

3173
03:20:56.580 --> 03:20:59.430
when you hear a real orgasm or a real laugh,

3174
03:20:59.700 --> 03:21:02.580
when you speed them up or slow them down,
they sound like animals.

3175
03:21:02.610 --> 03:21:06.900
Like if you take,
yeah,
that sounds like animals and fake laughs and fake orgasms.

3176
03:21:07.080 --> 03:21:09.750
When you slow them down,
sound fake.
They still sound fake.

3177
03:21:09.920 --> 03:21:14.390
So your brain is actually doing a similar type of analysis.

3178
03:21:16.470 --> 03:21:18.360
It's like usually to slow.
Actually,

3179
03:21:18.361 --> 03:21:21.300
one of the things we learned is if you're going to fake a laugh,
speed it up.

3180
03:21:22.230 --> 03:21:24.450
It makes him seem more animal way.

3181
03:21:24.540 --> 03:21:27.330
It's what if you take a real laugh and slow down or speed it up.

3182
03:21:27.331 --> 03:21:31.130
It sounds like a chimpanzee,
but a a fake laugh.
Slowed down sounds like.
Yeah.

3183
03:21:31.360 --> 03:21:32.193
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

3184
03:21:33.540 --> 03:21:36.110
<v 19>Right.
We're slowed down a real lapse.
I was like,
Ooh.</v>

3185
03:21:37.800 --> 03:21:38.633
<v 3>Right.</v>

3186
03:21:39.290 --> 03:21:41.730
<v 20>Same thing with an orgasm.
Isn't that crazy?
Yeah.</v>

3187
03:21:41.760 --> 03:21:46.070
So that's why your brain can tell it.
It has a in thing

3188
03:21:46.250 --> 03:21:49.310
<v 19>that obviously whether or not you can trust somebody and whether or not they're</v>

3189
03:21:49.311 --> 03:21:52.700
being forthcoming with you is important.
Yes.
Survival of our species.

3190
03:21:52.820 --> 03:21:57.620
So reading laughs and reading orgasms is actually like something you can do.

3191
03:21:57.900 --> 03:22:01.190
Interesting.
And it's probably,
it's not just a gap.
We have an innate ability.

3192
03:22:01.191 --> 03:22:05.180
Do you know conscious?
That's what you mean.
It's unconscious.

3193
03:22:06.020 --> 03:22:08.260
Subconscious.
Subconscious,
yes.
Sorry.

3194
03:22:09.530 --> 03:22:11.420
I would say your subconscious is unconscious.

3195
03:22:17.700 --> 03:22:22.700
You are so funny man of these kids are,

3196
03:22:22.731 --> 03:22:26.660
this is so funny.
Like why do the thing if you're not remotely interested,

3197
03:22:26.870 --> 03:22:29.060
well I do know what you're sweating.

3198
03:22:29.840 --> 03:22:33.230
You realize how fucking lame this joke is.
Break it down.

3199
03:22:33.231 --> 03:22:37.880
So the joke is how do you make holy water get regular water and boil and Devin

3200
03:22:38.630 --> 03:22:42.800
like using basically that's like an old lady who was like,

3201
03:22:42.801 --> 03:22:46.190
well you just got to bolt to Dale up.
Devil advocate.
Exactly.

3202
03:22:46.630 --> 03:22:49.950
It was a mistake that someone goes,
wait,
that's a drug.
Did this,

3203
03:22:49.951 --> 03:22:53.480
this boil the devil is kid.
Cause I didn't,
what did he laugh?

3204
03:22:53.660 --> 03:22:56.000
Did the kid on the left laugh or was he like,
well let's see it again.

3205
03:22:56.001 --> 03:22:59.620
Can we see the reaction of the,
that's what I wanted to see.

3206
03:22:59.630 --> 03:23:03.180
If he has enough wherewithal to be January board,
get rid of the water.

3207
03:23:05.570 --> 03:23:10.380
He
was like,
go fuck yourself with that Joe.
He's also,
he's,
he's Jay Leno.

3208
03:23:10.430 --> 03:23:14.570
He's Jay Leno winning him.
He's,
he's only thinking about say his.
That's right.

3209
03:23:14.630 --> 03:23:19.630
He's not listen [inaudible] Jay Leno coming up here.

3210
03:23:20.241 --> 03:23:25.180
Yeah,
he's,
he's thinking about his thing.
Um,
God,

3211
03:23:25.190 --> 03:23:29.970
this is the most rewarding job ever.
Let's go then.
What do you call Jackie?

3212
03:23:31.520 --> 03:23:33.410
What do you call Dracula with Hay Fever?

3213
03:23:34.610 --> 03:23:39.460
This is definitely going to be a bad pile.
Oh,
right.
Yeah,

3214
03:23:39.530 --> 03:23:42.230
yeah.
Let's go to bed

3215
03:23:44.420 --> 03:23:47.250
Paul.
And bad

3216
03:23:49.280 --> 03:23:53.920
computer from the 1980 [inaudible]

3217
03:23:56.930 --> 03:23:57.763
nightmare.

3218
03:23:59.390 --> 03:24:03.950
What do you call Dracula with Hay Fever?
The pollen count.
Get it.

3219
03:24:04.170 --> 03:24:07.950
I just want to kill my speed.
That's what I'm saying.
It's like I think this,

3220
03:24:08.150 --> 03:24:11.750
this I think do it.
Oh man,
here we go.

3221
03:24:12.470 --> 03:24:13.303
<v 6>Oh,</v>

3222
03:24:15.900 --> 03:24:18.930
<v 19>he loves it.
He loves it.
That's what I think about that Joe,</v>

3223
03:24:18.931 --> 03:24:19.960
and he's actually good double.

3224
03:24:20.190 --> 03:24:24.390
I get registered in the Jews whose book is 70% these people's book,

3225
03:24:24.720 --> 03:24:26.970
like these People's book is 70% Jewish book.

3226
03:24:27.540 --> 03:24:31.590
How can the Jews to be so funny and these fucking,
as Kurt Metzger said,

3227
03:24:31.591 --> 03:24:36.540
these boiled hams so white.
They look like that's a Kurt Metzger joke.
Yeah.

3228
03:24:36.550 --> 03:24:41.010
Now he's fucking boy white bread.
Wonder bread in a snow storm.

3229
03:24:41.160 --> 03:24:43.840
We are a culture humor.

3230
03:24:43.841 --> 03:24:47.490
Let's crew by Maggie said it's cause they boil all the fun out of you because

3231
03:24:47.500 --> 03:24:52.200
you can't have any sort of diverse ideas or or Ryan you got,

3232
03:24:52.201 --> 03:24:55.730
you got to keep it within the narrow confines.
I hear you.
Right.
Behavior.

3233
03:24:55.740 --> 03:24:58.950
That's true.
You're trying,
you're playing a very limited game.
There's a lot of,

3234
03:24:59.300 --> 03:25:02.820
it's like operation.
You've got to get him.
Yes,
yes.
But the truth is,

3235
03:25:02.821 --> 03:25:07.460
is these girls or the guys slots or slots,
everybody in these videos is a slat.

3236
03:25:07.470 --> 03:25:11.050
No,
I'm saying they have their real selves.
You know,

3237
03:25:11.650 --> 03:25:16.380
they have sleepovers and they tell a joke about a tampon looking like a stick of

3238
03:25:16.381 --> 03:25:18.220
dynamite or whatever it is.
Right.

3239
03:25:18.320 --> 03:25:22.050
And they actually have an authentic experience.

3240
03:25:22.051 --> 03:25:26.010
And the fact that that authentic experience is separate from their time in

3241
03:25:26.011 --> 03:25:27.810
church is again,
but do you think,

3242
03:25:28.210 --> 03:25:32.860
<v 5>tell cause have you ever met or hung out with somebody who genuinely is like,</v>

3243
03:25:34.270 --> 03:25:38.230
they're so sheltered that they have this like innocence way.
Are you like,

3244
03:25:38.231 --> 03:25:42.040
are you fucking serious where they,
they laugh at shit like that.

3245
03:25:42.041 --> 03:25:44.890
Like they have such that,
you know what I mean though?
I know people like that.

3246
03:25:44.920 --> 03:25:49.630
I have an aunt who's like 75 and still like that.
We're like,
she reads,

3247
03:25:49.720 --> 03:25:52.830
um,
reader's digest,
right books.
Uh,

3248
03:25:53.140 --> 03:25:56.440
they have a joke section as jokes like this and she'll sometimes laughed till

3249
03:25:56.441 --> 03:25:57.130
tears.
Yeah.

3250
03:25:57.130 --> 03:25:59.380
<v 19>And the enjoyment is,
is,
is two fold.</v>

3251
03:25:59.381 --> 03:26:03.910
It's like the joke itself and also the relief that you weren't offended.
Yeah.

3252
03:26:03.911 --> 03:26:04.660
You know what I mean?

3253
03:26:04.660 --> 03:26:07.800
You're sort of laughing and delight that you finally found her a joke for you.

3254
03:26:08.020 --> 03:26:11.500
She's reaching for it,
making sure this is off.
Oh,
thank [inaudible].
What's up?

3255
03:26:11.501 --> 03:26:16.390
It's off,
right?
How many fucking farts up is off?
Up is on.
I understand that.

3256
03:26:16.460 --> 03:26:20.530
Amazon,
I think downs probably off writing down is off.
Oh,

3257
03:26:20.531 --> 03:26:22.270
it's one of those weird Meitra down is off.

3258
03:26:24.900 --> 03:26:27.480
I just want to make sure it's not picking it.
I do want to say it's not,

3259
03:26:27.500 --> 03:26:28.540
it couldn't really be,

3260
03:26:28.541 --> 03:26:31.810
you can't really have a church where people are telling Tampon drugs.

3261
03:26:31.811 --> 03:26:34.000
I understand.
You know what I mean?
I'm not immediate,

3262
03:26:34.120 --> 03:26:38.320
but even the sheltered person that's also going like we'll create the appearance

3263
03:26:38.321 --> 03:26:43.030
of holiness bike with holding them from everything when really the way the way

3264
03:26:43.031 --> 03:26:46.210
out is through.
You know what I mean?
True,
true.
Holiness.

3265
03:26:46.211 --> 03:26:49.160
I think it comes from going through all of that experience.

3266
03:26:50.140 --> 03:26:51.010
This is very Buddhist,

3267
03:26:51.011 --> 03:26:55.120
but having compassion and love for all of humanity and all of that experience.

3268
03:26:55.210 --> 03:26:55.901
Instead of just going,

3269
03:26:55.901 --> 03:26:59.440
I'm going to sequester myself as a very 20th century Christianity,

3270
03:26:59.460 --> 03:27:01.580
or it's like we're just gonna.
We got no TV.

3271
03:27:01.581 --> 03:27:03.520
You got know that and I understand limiting that stuff,

3272
03:27:03.521 --> 03:27:06.430
but it's like fully isolate themselves.

3273
03:27:06.431 --> 03:27:09.480
It's now look how hard this nerd laughed at that fucking,
yeah,

3274
03:27:10.150 --> 03:27:13.500
she hasn't heard much.
She reminds

3275
03:27:14.720 --> 03:27:18.870
<v 5>why is she laughing that hard?
No,
no,
no.
If you needed help building an Ark,</v>

3276
03:27:18.930 --> 03:27:23.380
I know a guy that's not a selling building and I know a guy.
Oh,

3277
03:27:23.381 --> 03:27:26.480
we missed it was set up on that.
There is no set up.
No,
that's the,

3278
03:27:26.580 --> 03:27:31.560
if you need help building an Ark.
I know a guy.
He did it right.
I know a guy.

3279
03:27:31.830 --> 03:27:36.270
I know,
but I'm saying like as far as the video goes,
that's the beginning of it,

3280
03:27:36.300 --> 03:27:41.260
right?
That's the whole thing.
Yeah.
It's also,
this is a print joke.
Yeah.
There

3281
03:27:42.190 --> 03:27:44.620
<v 19>you don't know that.
That doesn't work.
Read Aloud.</v>

3282
03:27:45.140 --> 03:27:47.740
I'm going to send this at the pulpit.
Fucking idiot.

3283
03:27:48.460 --> 03:27:50.770
You're here to tell me the mysteries of the United States.

3284
03:27:51.230 --> 03:27:54.480
This joke isn't going to work by far.
It is your London living.

3285
03:27:55.120 --> 03:27:57.940
One time I was in a hotel and I was flipping by a,

3286
03:27:57.941 --> 03:28:00.060
it was in the Midwest or something and there were televangelists.

3287
03:28:00.070 --> 03:28:03.340
There was a televangelist and he had a fucking hairpiece.
It was like,

3288
03:28:03.370 --> 03:28:08.290
if you can't be honest about that,
you're up there talking about truth.

3289
03:28:09.380 --> 03:28:10.213
You got fucking,

3290
03:28:11.350 --> 03:28:16.330
it's sliding down and Jesus tells him to be honest with our neighbors,

3291
03:28:16.810 --> 03:28:20.060
fucking idiot.
What's angering me is this guy sunglasses.

3292
03:28:27.370 --> 03:28:30.400
Everyone's doing that.
By the way,
go to the airport.

3293
03:28:30.520 --> 03:28:34.720
You look away these hairy face to people facing you.
So weird.

3294
03:28:34.900 --> 03:28:37.330
This kid knows how to get to the mall.
This kid,

3295
03:28:37.450 --> 03:28:40.860
this kid and old borders at cheese cake factory without opening the mail

3296
03:28:43.750 --> 03:28:44.970
and I'm going to preorder.

3297
03:28:50.700 --> 03:28:51.533
You.
Want us to

3298
03:28:55.420 --> 03:28:56.253
Devin,

3299
03:28:58.100 --> 03:29:00.720
Devin free tee shirt,

3300
03:29:09.560 --> 03:29:13.230
Bible character had no,
or you could probably get this Adam and eve.

3301
03:29:14.020 --> 03:29:16.660
Well Jesus had Mary,
but no doubt.

3302
03:29:18.400 --> 03:29:23.260
Looking at it like a jeopardy question.
This is just going to be just let it go.

3303
03:29:31.170 --> 03:29:32.550
She really thought that was funny.

3304
03:29:39.730 --> 03:29:40.563
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

3305
03:29:42.290 --> 03:29:45.880
<v 19>funny.
I went to Catholic school and I went to Christian school.</v>

3306
03:29:47.760 --> 03:29:51.010
I've never heard of that.
No.
That's another thing that's missing.

3307
03:29:51.550 --> 03:29:54.700
We'll this joke play when spoken aloud.
No consideration.

3308
03:29:55.090 --> 03:29:58.350
Is this a known biblical reference?
What I said Bab,

3309
03:29:58.351 --> 03:30:01.370
she but these are you talking

3310
03:30:03.730 --> 03:30:05.910
donkey,
but in the old testament they call them asses,

3311
03:30:05.920 --> 03:30:08.080
so God spoke to bail him through his ass.

3312
03:30:10.180 --> 03:30:14.860
There's also my favorite is Hosea three eight which is go show love to your wife

3313
03:30:15.100 --> 03:30:18.790
just as the Lord your God shows love to the Israelites though they turn their

3314
03:30:18.791 --> 03:30:22.600
back on him and love the sacred raisin cakes.
Right.

3315
03:30:22.720 --> 03:30:25.090
We thought that was so funny because what the fuck is a segregation case?

3316
03:30:25.280 --> 03:30:28.600
Do you know what it is?
It's a euphemism for anal sex

3317
03:30:30.630 --> 03:30:33.820
that you're raising cane.
That's your sacred rays and Gig from the Bible.

3318
03:30:33.821 --> 03:30:36.190
It says Hosea three eight I believe

3319
03:30:38.350 --> 03:30:39.440
that's in your part.

3320
03:30:40.830 --> 03:30:45.140
You don't fucking Jew motherfucker you it sounds like hardcore fun.

3321
03:30:45.170 --> 03:30:49.190
That sounds like hardcore Israel lights love the sacred raisin.

3322
03:30:50.150 --> 03:30:53.780
I did not know that.
No.
I don't know if they did,
but I mean raising cake.

3323
03:30:53.810 --> 03:30:58.430
Hosea is PR painting with a pretty broad brush.
Even if a third of the,
of love,

3324
03:30:58.431 --> 03:31:00.600
the sacred raisin cakes and everybody was just,

3325
03:31:00.601 --> 03:31:02.660
so that was something that people would be like,
you know what amazing cake is,

3326
03:31:02.661 --> 03:31:03.770
right?
Like they would whisper it to,

3327
03:31:06.850 --> 03:31:08.710
even in the Bible,
we can't put,

3328
03:31:09.170 --> 03:31:14.170
I'm writing the Bible say they love eating mass and what are they doing?

3329
03:31:14.331 --> 03:31:17.550
They're raising cake given a little perimeter tickle.
Yeah,
exactly.
Getting all,

3330
03:31:17.580 --> 03:31:19.420
are they moving in with luggage all the way?

3331
03:31:21.270 --> 03:31:24.910
Your big anal guy never done it.
No.
No,

3332
03:31:26.690 --> 03:31:29.620
I don't.
I,
it's not because I think it's gross or weird or anything.

3333
03:31:33.410 --> 03:31:37.590
What's different for you?
Because you'd be receiving,
unless you,
yeah,

3334
03:31:37.591 --> 03:31:41.570
I guess you could strap strap on.
You certainly can.
Oh,

3335
03:31:44.850 --> 03:31:45.683
oh,

3336
03:31:46.000 --> 03:31:50.030
am I remember somebody at the Green Room of the comedy store.

3337
03:31:50.630 --> 03:31:54.860
It was Harlem when I was there with a bow and he was like,
you gotta try it.

3338
03:31:54.861 --> 03:31:59.780
It's fantastic.
He's so funny.
I'll tell you two quick Harland Williams.

3339
03:31:59.870 --> 03:32:02.060
Uh,
uh,
he's so great.
Can I say this?

3340
03:32:02.061 --> 03:32:04.970
I just thought of the joke answer is like I already have a hard enough time

3341
03:32:04.971 --> 03:32:06.890
believing that she likes vaginal sex.

3342
03:32:08.160 --> 03:32:12.410
That just like a joke obviously,
but like I need to know they like it.

3343
03:32:12.820 --> 03:32:17.310
I'm a performer,
so if there's something in there that I'm like,
no,
no,
no,

3344
03:32:18.020 --> 03:32:20.090
no,
no,
no,
no.
My wife is,
it's just a joke.

3345
03:32:20.510 --> 03:32:24.650
But I'm just saying like anything that kind of hinges on the idea that it's
like,

3346
03:32:24.860 --> 03:32:29.070
can you believe she's letting me do it in blog?
That doesn't get me off.

3347
03:32:29.190 --> 03:32:33.020
Now I'm there for her and I'm not saying this to be captain,
good guy.

3348
03:32:33.200 --> 03:32:35.660
I'm a standup.
It's a disfunction.
I want them to please it.

3349
03:32:35.661 --> 03:32:39.680
So if it's like I watch did it and then she was like slower and slower.

3350
03:32:39.681 --> 03:32:44.210
I'm not like,
if anybody was like,
hold on.
I'm like,
ah,
I'm not only is this over,

3351
03:32:44.211 --> 03:32:46.580
I've lost my erection and I want to read a book right now.

3352
03:32:48.290 --> 03:32:50.700
That's what I'm saying.
There's a lot of sense.

3353
03:32:51.410 --> 03:32:54.740
Anything that's like degree.
I've had girlfriends,

3354
03:32:55.100 --> 03:32:58.130
I had a girlfriend that was like a,
we went and bought a leash.

3355
03:32:58.580 --> 03:33:03.170
Neither of US had a dog.
Oh,
we went and got a leash and she,
it was her idea.

3356
03:33:03.560 --> 03:33:08.030
Do I have to look at my fucking,
whew,
I was city face.

3357
03:33:08.300 --> 03:33:11.930
I do not want to go with my girlfriend with a leash.

3358
03:33:12.120 --> 03:33:16.100
And she got this real thin one that like hurt and I hit her with it once and

3359
03:33:16.101 --> 03:33:20.120
like it left a red mark and I was like,
you're like,
I'm fucking no way.
Yes,

3360
03:33:20.150 --> 03:33:24.230
exactly.
Some people are like,
yeah,
and I'm not judging those people.

3361
03:33:24.231 --> 03:33:25.940
I'm just like,
that is not me.

3362
03:33:26.780 --> 03:33:30.860
He takes all of my effort to have good old fashioned meat and potatoes in the

3363
03:33:30.861 --> 03:33:34.070
vag.
See,
I like,
I like head in the toilet.

3364
03:33:34.100 --> 03:33:37.980
I like all that stat is hilarious.
Not with me,

3365
03:33:37.981 --> 03:33:41.670
but no one else has that day.
Um,
head in a toilet.

3366
03:33:42.090 --> 03:33:46.380
I remember one time I was sleeping with a girl and we know I'm married to you.

3367
03:33:46.381 --> 03:33:50.700
Remember that a long time ago.
So we'd get,
we'd gone out a few times.
And this is,

3368
03:33:50.730 --> 03:33:52.640
I thought that like,
cause I actually,
yeah,

3369
03:33:52.670 --> 03:33:57.370
<v 5>I really am Lovie dovie and you know,
like relationships.
And I'd now with your,</v>

3370
03:33:57.440 --> 03:34:00.600
I assume because I'm sleeping with her that we're,
we're,

3371
03:34:00.610 --> 03:34:04.160
we're kind of going towards a relationship,
you know,
in my mind.

3372
03:34:04.190 --> 03:34:08.680
I understand cause I'm 23 or something.
So we,
uh,

3373
03:34:08.681 --> 03:34:09.940
I've been married for a year,
right.

3374
03:34:11.890 --> 03:34:13.690
<v 19>So we go out a few times crazy.</v>

3375
03:34:13.930 --> 03:34:18.040
<v 5>And then she's at my place and I think we,</v>

3376
03:34:18.280 --> 03:34:23.030
I forget if we had,
maybe we had just,
we just had had sex,
we were about to,

3377
03:34:23.031 --> 03:34:27.910
and she was like,
you know,
um,
this other guy that I'm having sex with.

3378
03:34:27.940 --> 03:34:32.260
And I was like,
yeah.
And she's like,
like he really,
you know,

3379
03:34:32.880 --> 03:34:35.560
he bosses me around and like,
you know,

3380
03:34:35.561 --> 03:34:40.390
like puts toys in me and like really like as much more aggressive.
I like it.

3381
03:34:41.920 --> 03:34:42.753
I was like,
oh,

3382
03:34:43.500 --> 03:34:48.300
<v 19>oh,
okay.
See what I can tell.</v>

3383
03:34:48.770 --> 03:34:53.370
Because you're marriage material.
Yes.
Seen,
oh my God,
great title alert.

3384
03:34:53.930 --> 03:34:57.480
Damn.
Cigarette marriage materials material.
But I tell you what,

3385
03:34:57.481 --> 03:34:59.940
I got her that day.
Oh wait,
it's doubled.
Doubled.

3386
03:35:00.300 --> 03:35:04.730
I dumped at the entire strategy from the kitchen,
like with bananas and,

3387
03:35:05.750 --> 03:35:06.960
and like old food

3388
03:35:09.500 --> 03:35:13.500
water over her face.
You did made her eat the scrum from Wa.
Yeah.
Yeah.

3389
03:35:13.620 --> 03:35:15.900
And I was like,
is that what you want?
Like that.
But then I cried.

3390
03:35:19.220 --> 03:35:24.020
Then I cried.
So you're still a sensitive guy.
A good guy.
He didn't like it.

3391
03:35:24.021 --> 03:35:26.150
I don't,
what can I do?
I have a good guy.
He didn't like that.

3392
03:35:26.550 --> 03:35:29.970
I couldn't do that Shit,
man.
I couldn't do it.
I really couldn't do it.

3393
03:35:30.000 --> 03:35:33.840
I don't know.
I never could either.
Again,
I know it's very,

3394
03:35:33.841 --> 03:35:36.660
it's popular to be sweetened now,
which I'm,
which I'm all about.
Yeah.

3395
03:35:36.720 --> 03:35:41.430
But it's like any time,
even with just regular sex of somebody who was like,
wait,

3396
03:35:41.580 --> 03:35:44.860
I just be like,
this is over dude for me.
Here's the thing.
Here's the one that,

3397
03:35:44.890 --> 03:35:49.290
that was over for me.
Normal though.
I had this guy,
I had zero

3398
03:35:49.410 --> 03:35:51.690
<v 5>of the um,
oh,
you call it.</v>

3399
03:35:52.020 --> 03:35:56.190
But the part where when she's not interested,
where you go,

3400
03:35:56.191 --> 03:35:57.450
like I'll just keep trying.

3401
03:35:58.110 --> 03:35:59.550
<v 19>Zero.
That's tacky.</v>

3402
03:35:59.551 --> 03:36:04.030
So I always meaning like I only Puerto Rican guys do that.

3403
03:36:04.070 --> 03:36:08.000
I only had sex with,
I don't endorse that comment.

3404
03:36:09.180 --> 03:36:10.013
She bought the thing.

3405
03:36:10.080 --> 03:36:13.080
You can say that she said cause she slept with a number of them.

3406
03:36:13.230 --> 03:36:16.050
So they all pulled out man,
the Puerto Rican guy.

3407
03:36:16.051 --> 03:36:19.200
What is the move that you're just telling me to that?
Let's just put the tip.

3408
03:36:19.201 --> 03:36:21.720
Just let me just let me in.
Then you're like,
oh I don't know.

3409
03:36:21.721 --> 03:36:25.140
I don't know if I should.
And then they wear you down and then,

3410
03:36:25.370 --> 03:36:28.990
and then you just kind of do it right?
Yeah.
You know when you're part of it,

3411
03:36:29.000 --> 03:36:33.900
can you just Puerto Rican,
here's the thing.
Um
Wow.

3412
03:36:33.930 --> 03:36:37.690
Here's the,
if I was in Midwest right now,
I would be like,
man,

3413
03:36:37.691 --> 03:36:42.580
I'm a long way from la but I'm in La.
You guys are making,

3414
03:36:42.581 --> 03:36:44.080
what I was trying to say was this.

3415
03:36:44.150 --> 03:36:44.331
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

3416
03:36:44.331 --> 03:36:49.331
To me any amount of like hesitation or like not wanting to do something to me

3417
03:36:52.341 --> 03:36:56.780
would always completely turned me off from any sexual,

3418
03:36:57.150 --> 03:36:59.700
<v 19>like if someone's like weirder with,
oh no,
I'd be like,</v>

3419
03:37:00.210 --> 03:37:03.390
we did a sketch called Batman can stop thinking about sex.

3420
03:37:03.510 --> 03:37:06.990
And there was a line that Batman says,
which is so from my psyche,

3421
03:37:06.991 --> 03:37:10.620
obviously we're riffing a lot.
And he goes,
sometimes the sexiest they go,

3422
03:37:10.621 --> 03:37:12.740
well we could do is forgive.

3423
03:37:15.430 --> 03:37:19.950
I really find it in the dob,
fine by me audio.

3424
03:37:20.280 --> 03:37:23.930
It's towards the end.
But that to me this is real vulnerability.

3425
03:37:23.970 --> 03:37:27.680
Like there's emotional,
uh,
people everywhere.

3426
03:37:27.990 --> 03:37:30.330
People are going to call me a cock,
but I am,
what's up?

3427
03:37:30.331 --> 03:37:34.320
You fucking cock what's up cock?
Yeah,
I'm a fucking cock.
Yeah.
Hey Cox.

3428
03:37:34.350 --> 03:37:38.580
So suddenly or Mark Walberg,
Oh,
hey,
you're fucking cock.
I saw you over there.

3429
03:37:38.850 --> 03:37:42.420
You got no abs.
You're fucking cocky.
Fucking cock.
So anyway,
no apps.

3430
03:37:42.430 --> 03:37:47.010
You got no extra.
When do you cap?
I never sleep.
So anyway,
I,

3431
03:37:47.011 --> 03:37:51.540
uh,
I,
this is par for the course that we're be going like I don't,

3432
03:37:51.541 --> 03:37:54.480
I don't know if I can,
and then the woman being like,
it's fine.

3433
03:37:54.750 --> 03:37:56.190
And then me being like,
now I can,

3434
03:37:56.830 --> 03:38:01.350
my Grad is such a turn on for me because vulnerability and like emotional safe

3435
03:38:01.520 --> 03:38:06.510
is important.
It goes both ways.
Like a safe environment where it's like,

3436
03:38:06.780 --> 03:38:10.410
hey,
I don't care.
I got like,
everybody loves this feeling.
I got nowhere to be.

3437
03:38:10.590 --> 03:38:13.890
Yeah.
Like I'm,
I'm just happy to be with you that you don't have to be,

3438
03:38:13.920 --> 03:38:18.300
I feel like traditionally ladies is like that Lady Shit.
Fuck you.
No.
Yeah,

3439
03:38:18.510 --> 03:38:23.210
I got balls.
Yeah,
I got no,
but maybe I've,
I'm a Puerto Rican decide.

3440
03:38:23.370 --> 03:38:27.210
I have been with sweet men who look,
just wanted consensual,

3441
03:38:27.240 --> 03:38:29.610
nice experiences and those are always better.

3442
03:38:30.470 --> 03:38:34.290
Clearly argued deal.
Oh,
as long as you say,

3443
03:38:34.350 --> 03:38:38.840
as long as it's baked in the Puerto Rican,
Puerto Rican,
there's no

3444
03:38:41.110 --> 03:38:45.840
<v 17>Tim galactic.
Hello.
I'm available.
That's Christina.</v>

3445
03:38:46.150 --> 03:38:50.470
<v 19>I love the Puerto Rican.
I love Puerto Rican men.
Never ending.</v>

3446
03:38:50.500 --> 03:38:54.610
What's wrong with Dory at our house?
Like every weekend time.
Good Bulls on TV.

3447
03:38:54.611 --> 03:38:55.444
She's like,
Ooh,

3448
03:38:58.460 --> 03:39:00.530
I love them.
You got to be,

3449
03:39:00.540 --> 03:39:05.410
I'm just [inaudible] you forgive because I look at this green and the dad is

3450
03:39:05.411 --> 03:39:10.250
definitely not looking for it.
We don't have internet,

3451
03:39:10.251 --> 03:39:11.180
we don't have internet.

3452
03:39:12.010 --> 03:39:17.010
You want to walk in full Lizzy dimensional movies and how crazy that sounds.

3453
03:39:17.231 --> 03:39:17.760
Well

3454
03:39:17.760 --> 03:39:22.760
<v 5>the first thing we did when we got this space now four months ago was sign up</v>

3455
03:39:24.361 --> 03:39:27.970
for Internet and paid for it every month.
Uh,

3456
03:39:28.350 --> 03:39:32.640
a sizeable fee because it's a business book.
Like office park.
Yeah.

3457
03:39:33.110 --> 03:39:34.070
And in

3458
03:39:34.070 --> 03:39:38.660
<v 4>four months they haven't been able to give us Internet yet.
Four months.</v>

3459
03:39:39.590 --> 03:39:43.690
Meanwhile we've soundproof to room.
We built two sets.
Is it soundproof?

3460
03:39:43.730 --> 03:39:46.210
I feel like if I get too loud,
it's kind of echoey.

3461
03:39:46.250 --> 03:39:48.710
Well they're not done well done.
I don't know if you heard,

3462
03:39:48.711 --> 03:39:53.240
but we had a sponsor who McDonald's and we don't anymore.

3463
03:39:53.241 --> 03:39:56.870
So they left.
They fired us after last week's show.
Sorry,

3464
03:39:56.871 --> 03:40:00.290
but you were talking Mcdonald's.

3465
03:40:01.760 --> 03:40:06.060
They gave us over.
Tell me too much.
Over $2 million.
They did not.
They did.

3466
03:40:06.230 --> 03:40:09.080
And all we had to do is paint the set and make it look like an old McDonald's.

3467
03:40:09.690 --> 03:40:12.650
We painted it back after they fired us.
Hold up

3468
03:40:15.980 --> 03:40:19.670
last week.
It was yellow and red.
If you want to look at the Internet,

3469
03:40:19.850 --> 03:40:24.390
you was it based on a bit?
No.
Were you like I just love old Mcdonald's.

3470
03:40:24.500 --> 03:40:27.350
Here's that.
When we were moving to this space,
we started talking about it.

3471
03:40:27.440 --> 03:40:31.610
Podcasts had some traction.
Our agents were like trying to make something happen,

3472
03:40:31.730 --> 03:40:35.210
like make some money off of the fact that we were upgrading the studio.

3473
03:40:35.630 --> 03:40:39.620
She's got some corporate
yeah,

3474
03:40:39.710 --> 03:40:41.300
I couldn't be more interested.

3475
03:40:44.430 --> 03:40:49.220
Um,
so I got,
I'm so interested,

3476
03:40:49.580 --> 03:40:52.430
I turned down lower offers cause I thought it was just ridiculous.

3477
03:40:52.760 --> 03:40:57.760
And somehow they came up to two point $3 million that we could basically spend

3478
03:40:58.341 --> 03:41:00.710
to run this operation for a few years.

3479
03:41:01.100 --> 03:41:04.640
And then last week we're doing the show.

3480
03:41:04.790 --> 03:41:08.750
That just makes me think you're overhead is way too high.
Then the dog.

3481
03:41:10.450 --> 03:41:12.440
Well,
show him Terry.
So here's what happened.

3482
03:41:12.920 --> 03:41:17.690
This show last week we put um,
uncle Terry on basically,

3483
03:41:17.750 --> 03:41:22.750
and we do a segment with this guy and Mcdonald's full lips out that we basically

3484
03:41:24.980 --> 03:41:27.770
did this.
So I'll share it.
Weight,

3485
03:41:28.610 --> 03:41:31.280
anything that you have on the hard disk we can watch.

3486
03:41:33.090 --> 03:41:36.250
It has to be on the heart.
Yeah.
Yeah.

3487
03:41:36.470 --> 03:41:40.820
Go ahead and do a spotlight search for it.
Search again,

3488
03:41:40.821 --> 03:41:44.970
like for this guy.
But this is what God,
this is what a lot of lost our money.

3489
03:41:45.070 --> 03:41:46.730
If you think this guy's a Christian

3490
03:41:47.510 --> 03:41:51.390
<v 9>and there guys,
it's Pete again and I'm here to do less PTO.</v>

3491
03:41:55.180 --> 03:41:57.700
I thought I'd try that again.
And then I also wanted to try this.

3492
03:41:57.701 --> 03:42:02.110
Step one did fuck sleep that has these like massive bullets in him.

3493
03:42:02.500 --> 03:42:03.730
I haven't used it of chorus.

3494
03:42:03.731 --> 03:42:07.990
And then I went to look and they didn't send any better.
He so bad,

3495
03:42:12.750 --> 03:42:17.600
but I vibrates.
So I'm sure that's going to get me off and it's going to,

3496
03:42:17.720 --> 03:42:22.410
it's got this cool,
cool man.

3497
03:42:22.420 --> 03:42:23.440
I got this cool.

3498
03:42:23.910 --> 03:42:28.100
A friend of mine had one candy fucks up with his boyfriend and it's a double end

3499
03:42:28.101 --> 03:42:32.220
of dude.
So I really want to try this because I like fucking stuff

3500
03:42:32.990 --> 03:42:34.150
<v 19>first.
I'm going to try and get this in</v>

3501
03:42:35.090 --> 03:42:37.310
<v 9>and then turn it out and teeth and gums</v>

3502
03:42:39.770 --> 03:42:40.620
coming back.
Why

3503
03:42:43.320 --> 03:42:48.110
<v 19>this guy doesn't worry about Jesus.
There's at all to me that like it's sort of,</v>

3504
03:42:48.170 --> 03:42:51.190
I admire his freedom.
Right?
That's what I was saying.
I didn't,

3505
03:42:51.210 --> 03:42:54.010
I did not save with Nikki Glaser and they gave us like a,

3506
03:42:54.170 --> 03:42:56.840
like a flashlight and I was like,
I'm going to try this.

3507
03:42:56.841 --> 03:43:01.190
And as soon as I came inside of it I was like,
okay this,

3508
03:43:01.260 --> 03:43:06.020
I'm going to bury this.
Like I had like a dog in a great though.
I've never,

3509
03:43:06.380 --> 03:43:08.490
is it great?
He was,
but it wasn't worth the,

3510
03:43:08.540 --> 03:43:12.660
the emotional cause I eat like that was the only way I could get there.

3511
03:43:14.270 --> 03:43:19.070
It was a gift.
I have to use the gift and then you're just in your bedroom alone.

3512
03:43:19.100 --> 03:43:22.970
God,
this guy is like,
yeah,
like fucking stuff.

3513
03:43:24.830 --> 03:43:26.210
Be on the American flag

3514
03:43:30.300 --> 03:43:31.580
on a cooking show.

3515
03:43:33.930 --> 03:43:37.220
Jeff only going to get me off.
This vibrates big.
No,

3516
03:43:37.221 --> 03:43:40.670
no to you or an error to Microsoft.

3517
03:43:40.671 --> 03:43:44.480
If I was looking at porn and this guy makes a video going,
blue battery,

3518
03:43:44.481 --> 03:43:47.630
I got to put this in my ass and he's kind of judgment free.
He's like,

3519
03:43:47.631 --> 03:43:48.260
I have a friend.

3520
03:43:48.260 --> 03:43:53.060
He fucks it with this kind of beautiful like strangely good shape,

3521
03:43:57.610 --> 03:44:01.650
<v 9>texture to it.
Okay.
It'll be easy to go in.</v>

3522
03:44:03.820 --> 03:44:06.790
He sits on a porn site or uh,
or uh,

3523
03:44:07.240 --> 03:44:11.790
or not NBC News on Youtube or is unimportant.

3524
03:44:27.950 --> 03:44:31.750
This isn't just a blog.

3525
03:44:32.230 --> 03:44:33.750
He's a porn guy.
He's making

3526
03:44:34.670 --> 03:44:37.940
<v 19>no like you cropped it.
Well,
I didn't drop it,
but yeah.</v>

3527
03:44:38.530 --> 03:44:43.530
Lovely crop like this is so you can watch it and masturbate thing.

3528
03:44:44.861 --> 03:44:46.960
It's not just instructional.
I mean,
look at that.

3529
03:44:46.990 --> 03:44:49.330
Look at those dead eyes right there.
Those are really,

3530
03:44:49.560 --> 03:44:53.620
it looks like he's reading a,
a pastor joke.
I know a guy,

3531
03:44:54.900 --> 03:44:56.470
that car painter,

3532
03:45:00.460 --> 03:45:04.390
a car painter.
He's having more fun.
Those kids.
Oh my God.

3533
03:45:07.030 --> 03:45:07.660
<v 9>Right.</v>

3534
03:45:07.660 --> 03:45:10.350
<v 19>Wait,
right here.
We find out Mcdonald's was super pissed off.</v>

3535
03:45:11.040 --> 03:45:12.900
Like they were not into this at this point.

3536
03:45:14.970 --> 03:45:17.480
Was it worth the two point?

3537
03:45:17.490 --> 03:45:21.890
Was it 3.2 0.3 2.3 I think it might've been worth.

3538
03:45:22.340 --> 03:45:23.490
We'll let you decide.
The clips

3539
03:45:25.860 --> 03:45:27.840
<v 9>go slow.
Don't try and rush it.</v>

3540
03:45:28.900 --> 03:45:32.020
Try and go too fast instead of a little hurt.

3541
03:45:32.420 --> 03:45:37.220
Try to dick the tip of the day
so he's rock hard.

3542
03:45:37.240 --> 03:45:41.860
Did you get used to it?
You learn how to breathe and relax yourself.

3543
03:45:42.710 --> 03:45:47.450
Blood plate can be alive.
He's actually,
it's kind of compassionate man.

3544
03:45:47.550 --> 03:45:52.140
<v 19>He is.
Yes.
He's doing it for help.
He's like,
look,
I get it.
Yeah.
Maybe you're new.</v>

3545
03:45:52.141 --> 03:45:54.990
I know.
I should just be laughing,
but I'm like,
it's got a lovely,

3546
03:45:56.460 --> 03:45:59.200
I disagree wholeheartedly.
I'm with you though.
Yeah,

3547
03:45:59.340 --> 03:46:03.800
I'm with you and that I feel like this guy is,
he is shame-free.

3548
03:46:04.870 --> 03:46:09.250
Nope.
I like it'd be celebrated because as he shaved for you once to help others.

3549
03:46:09.270 --> 03:46:10.670
No,
no,
you guys are wrong.

3550
03:46:10.770 --> 03:46:15.210
This guy is a total fucking weird beard and he needs to learn shame and

3551
03:46:15.211 --> 03:46:19.530
boundaries.
There's no,
he needs to have some shame.

3552
03:46:19.970 --> 03:46:23.380
<v 9>Shame is a good thing and small those in their</v>

3553
03:46:26.270 --> 03:46:29.960
mind.
I thought he was wearing underwear.

3554
03:46:31.100 --> 03:46:33.530
It's nice.
It's got a nice feel to it.

3555
03:46:34.910 --> 03:46:38.930
So let me try and turn it on.
The remote doesn't seem to work,

3556
03:46:38.931 --> 03:46:41.710
at least when I first tried it with turning on and just,

3557
03:46:42.140 --> 03:46:43.520
it cycles through the steps.

3558
03:46:47.930 --> 03:46:48.920
That's just a constant.

3559
03:46:52.580 --> 03:46:55.100
I hate his face.
I hate his face.

3560
03:46:56.350 --> 03:46:58.050
It's like it's evolving space.

3561
03:47:02.510 --> 03:47:04.210
<v 19>I hate this guy's fucking fall</v>

3562
03:47:05.850 --> 03:47:10.850
is how much of the video is left and it makes me feel so don't you feel gross

3563
03:47:11.961 --> 03:47:16.940
inside?
He loves his,
this is his favorite.

3564
03:47:17.720 --> 03:47:20.660
I hate this video
where it

3565
03:47:22.520 --> 03:47:27.110
took you.
Yeah,
your happiest place.
See how sick he is?
He has no compassion.

3566
03:47:27.350 --> 03:47:32.260
I love,
no,
my husband's got mental problems.
Why?
This is I like,
cool guys.

3567
03:47:32.270 --> 03:47:36.590
This guy's not like
I like,

3568
03:47:36.720 --> 03:47:41.670
<v 9>cool.
I'm going to try out the sleep now.
My God.
And like I said,</v>

3569
03:47:41.671 --> 03:47:44.130
I'm really kind of disappointed that this won't be vibrating too.

3570
03:47:44.131 --> 03:47:45.300
But I think probably speed.

3571
03:47:47.750 --> 03:47:51.210
I didn't think it really has some really weird

3572
03:47:52.670 --> 03:47:56.620
<v 19>because he was like ass not to assume that all gay men do ass play,</v>

3573
03:47:56.621 --> 03:48:00.020
but he seemed like a straight guy being like,
look,
it's not that weird.
Oh,
right,

3574
03:48:00.021 --> 03:48:02.330
right.
Do you want to play with your body?
That's why I kinda thought it was.

3575
03:48:03.080 --> 03:48:06.980
But he's got the gay pride necklace and the fuck's leave that he likes to use of

3576
03:48:06.981 --> 03:48:09.350
this friend.
It's kind of neat.
So did he say that?

3577
03:48:09.440 --> 03:48:11.120
I thought he said I have a friend that uses,

3578
03:48:11.130 --> 03:48:15.380
I think he shares it with his friend.
Well no I think he,
I think he's right.

3579
03:48:15.381 --> 03:48:18.290
But there's also another part in this we definitely talks about.

3580
03:48:18.470 --> 03:48:21.110
It'd be cool to fuck this with somebody else.
It'd be cool.
Yeah.

3581
03:48:23.990 --> 03:48:28.010
I mean yeah,
it's kind of like when you see somebody at this guy,

3582
03:48:28.310 --> 03:48:30.010
this guy actually has a lot in common with what John,

3583
03:48:30.020 --> 03:48:32.660
here's what I have to kill the person that Mcdonald's is like I want to number

3584
03:48:32.661 --> 03:48:36.110
one and number two and number five this guy is,

3585
03:48:36.650 --> 03:48:41.300
that's why Mcdonald's was like we can't be,
this is a conflict of interest.

3586
03:48:41.301 --> 03:48:42.920
You can either promote this guy or us.

3587
03:48:42.950 --> 03:48:47.930
That's true cause the culinary version of this guy shamelessness it's the irony

3588
03:48:47.931 --> 03:48:48.411
is that I had,

3589
03:48:48.411 --> 03:48:53.090
when I have to deal with is that this is now by far the hardest I've ever

3590
03:48:53.091 --> 03:48:57.950
laughed from a video and he's responsible for us to losing $2 million in

3591
03:48:57.951 --> 03:49:02.030
sponsorship.
Also.
I still,
the story would be,

3592
03:49:02.060 --> 03:49:06.470
sorry the story,
it'd be way more if we were at your house.

3593
03:49:07.130 --> 03:49:11.630
Yeah,
I was almost going to say like a normal fuck.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

3594
03:49:11.690 --> 03:49:16.040
But the fact that you say we could have run this operation for a couple of
years,

3595
03:49:17.190 --> 03:49:20.420
takes all of the pathos and relate-ability out of that story.

3596
03:49:21.020 --> 03:49:23.740
No one cares.
But you lost two boys.

3597
03:49:24.080 --> 03:49:29.080
I know because you were wasting it on rent in this overhead from these

3598
03:49:29.721 --> 03:49:33.740
employees.
I mean that you need them,
but you don't need them in this space.

3599
03:49:33.741 --> 03:49:37.670
We don't need easy parking.
And if you were like,

3600
03:49:37.671 --> 03:49:42.530
and we could be sending our kids to send the story,

3601
03:49:42.531 --> 03:49:47.390
we care again,
who told you to do this

3602
03:49:48.950 --> 03:49:53.820
because it wasn't your idea to do what?
I mean,
it looks great.

3603
03:49:56.100 --> 03:49:59.660
I really want to take a new sponsor.
Morton's is doing it now

3604
03:50:01.390 --> 03:50:05.780
for this now.
They paid,
they paid to paint off of Mcdonald's stuff.
Okay,

3605
03:50:05.781 --> 03:50:08.300
so you saw,
I didn't even know this was an option.
Yeah.

3606
03:50:08.600 --> 03:50:11.730
We'll make our studio look like a Morton's.
Yeah,

3607
03:50:12.260 --> 03:50:14.900
and then you'll give us money.
Yeah.
I mean they have,

3608
03:50:15.100 --> 03:50:20.100
they have Brussels sprouts with Bacon and then they have asparagus with uh,

3609
03:50:20.750 --> 03:50:25.750
and they don't care that this guy is the lead in to Utah meat heavy menu.

3610
03:50:26.520 --> 03:50:29.720
They give us way less money.
The lump crab cake.

3611
03:50:30.800 --> 03:50:33.010
Lump crab cake there.
Scallops.

3612
03:50:36.380 --> 03:50:39.800
But whose idea was that?
I know Jen.
No judge.
Really?

3613
03:50:40.680 --> 03:50:44.810
I'm curious.
You guys were like,
I want to do it like Rogan.

3614
03:50:45.290 --> 03:50:48.100
Just an office man.
We wanted to move.
He didn't want to do it.

3615
03:50:49.730 --> 03:50:54.730
That's the origin of this period is get out of the house when you want to get

3616
03:50:56.331 --> 03:50:59.530
out of the house.
What am I your business manager?
Yes.

3617
03:50:59.720 --> 03:51:02.750
I'm just saying there are other options other than having your own,

3618
03:51:02.970 --> 03:51:06.920
are you going to have other podcasts that use this space?
Give you a kick?

3619
03:51:07.310 --> 03:51:10.790
There's going to be other podcasts done over there and that are under your

3620
03:51:10.791 --> 03:51:14.540
umbrella basically.
Yeah.
They give you a kick.
There's a little taste.

3621
03:51:14.690 --> 03:51:18.590
There's a tape.
There's like one of those.
I mean they get the majority of it.

3622
03:51:19.160 --> 03:51:21.740
I mean you should get some of it because you're letting them record,

3623
03:51:21.741 --> 03:51:26.160
but that's the whole,
that's the whole swap of it.
You know,
like you get,

3624
03:51:26.340 --> 03:51:30.990
you know you have a,
you have a production team.
Yeah.
You,
yeah,
you could wow.

3625
03:51:31.140 --> 03:51:33.350
Well,
but I don't want to do and out of my house or like do it.

3626
03:51:33.360 --> 03:51:36.060
You could have rented a space like an already existing space.

3627
03:51:36.100 --> 03:51:40.260
Somebody else's podcast.
A time in a,
in a podcast based.
Yeah,
but those are gross.

3628
03:51:40.380 --> 03:51:43.530
Or just rented office.
This is an office.
This is,

3629
03:51:43.590 --> 03:51:48.570
this is somewhere you could park an airplane.
Like if I,

3630
03:51:48.571 --> 03:51:52.380
if I was looking for a place to park 12 cards.
Yeah.
I would call you guys.

3631
03:51:52.381 --> 03:51:53.610
There's three cars in the back of this thing.

3632
03:51:53.640 --> 03:51:56.580
That's what I'm saying is there's so much room,

3633
03:51:57.750 --> 03:52:02.640
but I kiss for another funny of how I think I'm thinking about renting the place

3634
03:52:02.641 --> 03:52:06.480
next door to tell me everything because I find this interesting.

3635
03:52:06.630 --> 03:52:11.400
You seem like,
and I mean this with love,
peace,
sinless,
like a Schlubby guy.
Yeah.

3636
03:52:11.490 --> 03:52:15.480
You know what I mean?
When you say Tom Segura Schlubby Guy,
look at this.

3637
03:52:15.481 --> 03:52:17.970
I got fucking baby puke on this.
Somebody told me,
I looked like I be,

3638
03:52:17.990 --> 03:52:22.410
I run a bowling alley.
You look like you run a bowling alley.
Meanwhile,

3639
03:52:22.890 --> 03:52:25.620
you have a podcast and you were like,

3640
03:52:25.920 --> 03:52:29.940
we need a studio and a Lamborghini.

3641
03:52:30.470 --> 03:52:33.720
You want to,
you know,
he put the down payment on the Lamborghini.

3642
03:52:34.890 --> 03:52:35.820
Let me tell you something.

3643
03:52:36.570 --> 03:52:41.100
Not only do not does no one care about you losing 2.3 now we're a little bit

3644
03:52:41.101 --> 03:52:43.890
glad I get to tell everybody about the Lamborghini

3645
03:52:45.960 --> 03:52:50.760
now because the money's gone.
We're not going to get it.
Yeah.
What do you mean?

3646
03:52:50.790 --> 03:52:51.960
I just try to secure one.

3647
03:52:51.961 --> 03:52:56.670
I was just trying to secure one so you could drive a Lamborghini.

3648
03:52:56.730 --> 03:52:59.280
Oh,
he loves that.
He rented one just for fun.

3649
03:52:59.850 --> 03:53:02.960
You drove around is being like,
yeah.
Yes.

3650
03:53:02.970 --> 03:53:07.380
That guy who looks like a meatball sub got struck by lightning and became a

3651
03:53:07.381 --> 03:53:11.250
comedian.
Yes.
And you were like,
I'm going to drive Bruce Wayne's car.

3652
03:53:11.550 --> 03:53:15.330
I really like,
that's why you love this guy.

3653
03:53:15.770 --> 03:53:19.650
Ignore this guy going and getting the Lambo.
Shut the thing up your ass.

3654
03:53:19.651 --> 03:53:24.600
Eat a whopper.
You don't give a fuck.
This is your spirit animal,
the here.

3655
03:53:24.620 --> 03:53:28.050
Right.
I think you got it.
And I,
by the way,

3656
03:53:28.170 --> 03:53:33.010
oh God.
It's just so interesting that a guy that you look like you'd go Sandler.

3657
03:53:33.011 --> 03:53:36.110
You know what I mean?
I just want to wear sweat pants and if I do,

3658
03:53:36.490 --> 03:53:37.001
here's the thing.

3659
03:53:37.001 --> 03:53:42.001
The most fun thing is to wear sweat pants and a shirt with a stain on it and get

3660
03:53:42.101 --> 03:53:45.340
it aligned.
Again,
the Lambo or something.
I couldn't get an a lamp.
First of all,

3661
03:53:45.341 --> 03:53:49.590
I'm six foot six but you are not that tall.
That's one of the big lies out there.

3662
03:53:49.600 --> 03:53:52.830
So funny.
It's one of the big wow.
That is,

3663
03:53:53.110 --> 03:53:57.610
I'll tell people are right now page
five,
10 and a half.

3664
03:53:57.850 --> 03:54:01.870
That is just for the record.
So one of the big lines,

3665
03:54:02.710 --> 03:54:07.030
that is the key to all a hard,
I'll be honest about,
I'll be honest,

3666
03:54:07.031 --> 03:54:10.510
but I hate Lamborghinis.
What do you mean?
I'm really not a fan.

3667
03:54:11.020 --> 03:54:13.480
I don't understand that they have the best.
No,
I just,

3668
03:54:13.510 --> 03:54:16.930
I feel like it's a clown car.
I could never,
no clowns could fit.

3669
03:54:17.320 --> 03:54:20.050
I just don't like them.
I think as,
I think it's a clownish thing to drive.

3670
03:54:20.320 --> 03:54:21.910
So what I do like try to buy one,

3671
03:54:22.010 --> 03:54:25.860
I just thought it'd be funny to how much is a Lamborghini you can get.
I mean,

3672
03:54:25.861 --> 03:54:30.040
you can get in one for probably like two and a quarter,
like s,
you know,
but,

3673
03:54:31.210 --> 03:54:35.260
but like,
you know,
if you want to get like a,
a nicer Molly,
you spending like 400

3674
03:54:36.880 --> 03:54:40.510
hundred I would spend that on a Ferrari though.
Tom,

3675
03:54:40.840 --> 03:54:45.370
I'm so happy to learn this about you.
I just didn't know.
What was your dad like?

3676
03:54:45.490 --> 03:54:49.450
He's got like six hours.
That's it.
No,
just kidding.
I was gay.
He loves cars,

3677
03:54:49.451 --> 03:54:53.530
but he never got anything crazy.
I wonder where you got it.
You know what he mean?

3678
03:54:53.531 --> 03:54:57.280
Like I got my money back.
What do you mean?

3679
03:54:57.520 --> 03:55:01.660
I threw them a hundred grand to hold this one car and then they give it back to

3680
03:55:01.661 --> 03:55:05.020
me cause I was like,
I'm not going to get it.
So Hey,

3681
03:55:05.230 --> 03:55:07.360
if there's one thing I know about the Lamborghini people,

3682
03:55:07.361 --> 03:55:08.950
they're decent salt of the earth.

3683
03:55:09.760 --> 03:55:13.670
If you give them a hundred gs just to hold the car.
Yeah,
yeah,

3684
03:55:13.690 --> 03:55:18.340
they'll give it back.
You know,
lend you some tools.
We'll give you some milk.
Wait,

3685
03:55:18.341 --> 03:55:21.190
what do you think about cars though?
You don't like cars?
I don't care about that.

3686
03:55:21.320 --> 03:55:26.080
Really wish I had that travel.
Like I,
and I don't mean traveling.

3687
03:55:26.110 --> 03:55:29.890
In fact,
I hate when people are like,
if I didn't have to work,
I'd travel.

3688
03:55:29.891 --> 03:55:34.840
It's like some more thinking,
Julie,
you are a bore because women are done.

3689
03:55:37.620 --> 03:55:37.860
<v 17>I</v>

3690
03:55:37.860 --> 03:55:41.810
<v 19>still got it,
gave it color to make it a person and I see all equals always.</v>

3691
03:55:41.811 --> 03:55:45.180
He's to Julie.
I know,
but I hate when people are like,
I try.
I don't mean that.

3692
03:55:45.181 --> 03:55:48.350
I mean I'm six foot six so if I go to a gig now you fly first class.

3693
03:55:48.410 --> 03:55:51.260
That's a lot of money.
Yeah,
but not you guys.
I mean,

3694
03:55:51.261 --> 03:55:56.010
you were given a hundred grand to hold a car.
Yeah,
that's true.
It's easy money.

3695
03:55:56.040 --> 03:55:59.730
But you guys like spending money,
that's fun.
No,
we really don't spend any money.

3696
03:56:00.200 --> 03:56:03.680
I don't spend that day.
I don't spend crazy money.
I really don't know.

3697
03:56:04.140 --> 03:56:07.440
Have you not bought anything that you're like,
wow,
that's,
I bought,

3698
03:56:07.890 --> 03:56:12.450
I have a sauna,
but that was $300 or something.
You can buy a soda.

3699
03:56:12.480 --> 03:56:16.590
People can save up a biased by any jewelry or anything.
Jewelry.
I mean,

3700
03:56:16.591 --> 03:56:21.540
I bought this,
I got this Cuban linked diamond studded your chain.

3701
03:56:21.690 --> 03:56:25.680
So it was 35 grand and I've worn it once and I got it two years ago.

3702
03:56:25.860 --> 03:56:30.600
I got to say,
man,
for somebody who looks like he cooks grilled cheeses,

3703
03:56:31.390 --> 03:56:35.070
I'm part of the engine of the Winnebago.
He's driving across country.

3704
03:56:35.820 --> 03:56:37.710
I can't believe you're,
I think that,
first of all,

3705
03:56:37.711 --> 03:56:39.990
I only are doing hip hop my whole life.

3706
03:56:39.991 --> 03:56:44.880
You're doing it and you're talking about it.
Yeah.
I kind of love it.
Thank you.

3707
03:56:44.910 --> 03:56:49.860
35 if I spent $35,000 on a piece of jewelry,

3708
03:56:50.040 --> 03:56:53.750
jewelry,
just a made up thing.
Yeah,
go list.

3709
03:56:57.600 --> 03:57:00.330
Have you were like,
Ooh.
Yeah.

3710
03:57:01.980 --> 03:57:06.300
Anyone,
not just your listeners.
35 grand would change their life and you're like,

3711
03:57:06.480 --> 03:57:10.800
I keep it in the drawer.
Sneakers.
10 grand on sneakers.
Easy peasy.

3712
03:57:11.840 --> 03:57:15.300
Mcdonald's.
You got to give it all back.
Yeah,
I did.

3713
03:57:15.301 --> 03:57:17.910
I mean we had to give all the Mcdonald's money back.
That's serious money,
man.

3714
03:57:18.030 --> 03:57:20.480
Yeah,
but then you went to Morton's.
Yeah.
Morton's morning.

3715
03:57:20.481 --> 03:57:24.150
He's got the big potato every week.
Pills at night.

3716
03:57:26.220 --> 03:57:31.220
They give you a big boy knife and the porterhouse porterhouse yoke.

3717
03:57:32.181 --> 03:57:36.100
You can share for $105 for two people.
You know,

3718
03:57:36.350 --> 03:57:38.600
I just,
I like their French onion soup.

3719
03:57:38.620 --> 03:57:42.390
I'm worried that you're a behind the music in the making.
Oh,
don't say that.

3720
03:57:43.420 --> 03:57:47.030
Damn it.
You're gonna scare my wife.
I'm worried.

3721
03:57:47.031 --> 03:57:48.340
I don't think it's going to happen.
Hey,

3722
03:57:48.380 --> 03:57:49.820
will you please show him the rest of Pete?

3723
03:57:49.821 --> 03:57:53.680
We didn't even get to see the rest of it.
No,
no.
Thank you uncle Terry.

3724
03:57:54.300 --> 03:57:59.150
Gimme a sec.
I'll load it up.
Give him 25 minutes to find it on the hard drive.

3725
03:57:59.960 --> 03:58:03.560
Sorry.
New System.
And by the way,
we don't want Internet case.
You're wondering.

3726
03:58:03.620 --> 03:58:07.460
I like that.
Choose to do the show this way.
Now let me ask you this.

3727
03:58:07.790 --> 03:58:11.150
How many things does Terry have going at once here?

3728
03:58:11.630 --> 03:58:14.960
There's the vibrating,
but plug.
I thought his name was Pete.

3729
03:58:15.910 --> 03:58:17.850
We nicknamed him Terry.
He just looks like a Terry.

3730
03:58:18.350 --> 03:58:23.000
There's something else in his hand right now.
When there's a blip,
the sleeve,

3731
03:58:23.150 --> 03:58:24.020
my name's blip.

3732
03:58:24.770 --> 03:58:27.860
<v 9>I'm going to try to sleep and like I said,</v>

3733
03:58:27.861 --> 03:58:30.320
I'm really kind of disappointed that this won't be vibrating too,

3734
03:58:30.321 --> 03:58:35.220
but I think that this thing going off in my foot,
it's going to be okay.

3735
03:58:36.190 --> 03:58:40.990
And this has some really weird knobbies coming inside there.
Oops.

3736
03:58:43.340 --> 03:58:47.040
What are you doing?
Opening one ED.
Dripping Lube.

3737
03:58:48.110 --> 03:58:48.943
Wow.

3738
03:58:56.600 --> 03:59:01.580
Wow,
that's tight.
Fuck,

3739
03:59:01.840 --> 03:59:02.673
fuck,
fuck,
fuck.

3740
03:59:17.930 --> 03:59:22.610
I think that's what you call it ruined orgasm because I didn't want to come,

3741
03:59:24.640 --> 03:59:26.260
just wasn't expecting it.

3742
03:59:30.810 --> 03:59:34.200
<v 19>He came too quickly for the toy on his review thing.
Yeah.</v>

3743
03:59:34.210 --> 03:59:38.090
And his toy in the toy is like,
it happens to a lot of my bad.

3744
03:59:38.700 --> 03:59:43.020
That was supposed to be louder.
Um,
look,
he loves biking.

3745
03:59:43.320 --> 03:59:47.100
He's got printer paper,
he's got a cat and he's an outdoorsman for sure.

3746
03:59:47.610 --> 03:59:51.810
I mean it's got the body.
I'm kind of feel like I feel like piece,

3747
03:59:51.811 --> 03:59:55.500
the first guy that made me feel this ridiculous about what I mean about

3748
03:59:55.501 --> 03:59:58.840
everything.
What do you know what I mean?
Are you talking about like,

3749
03:59:59.020 --> 04:00:03.490
like just like what the fuck is up with this space?
Jewelry.

3750
04:00:04.350 --> 04:00:07.690
Cars.
Who are you?
And I'm like,
wait,
what's going on?
Well,
the,
I,

3751
04:00:07.691 --> 04:00:10.020
I guess I'd never thought of myself as a cheap person,

3752
04:00:10.021 --> 04:00:14.210
but there isn't a part of you that's like,
I hope this is interesting.
It is.

3753
04:00:14.550 --> 04:00:19.020
You have a very popular podcast.
Why not?
Why not?

3754
04:00:20.460 --> 04:00:24.300
When I keep something like that,
right.
Joe,

3755
04:00:24.400 --> 04:00:28.980
you realize we're playing pro ball.
Yeah.
Like our careers are in,

3756
04:00:29.040 --> 04:00:31.920
our salaries are inflated.
Mike Birbiglia told me that he was like,

3757
04:00:31.921 --> 04:00:34.460
don't forget you started making a TV show.
He started doing this.

3758
04:00:34.480 --> 04:00:35.880
This is whatever.
Don't forget,

3759
04:00:35.881 --> 04:00:40.650
your salary is inflated because your career as a as a time limit on it.
Right.

3760
04:00:40.680 --> 04:00:43.470
You know what I'm saying?
So obviously you could do this for 10 years.

3761
04:00:43.471 --> 04:00:45.240
Radio is a little bit different from other things,

3762
04:00:45.540 --> 04:00:47.370
but I just have this thing where I'm like,
yeah,

3763
04:00:47.371 --> 04:00:50.250
we're in the magical fruity kingdom and that's,
and that's wonderful.

3764
04:00:50.251 --> 04:00:54.570
Have some fruity pebbles,
eat some grapes off the tree.
It's great.
But I'm like,

3765
04:00:54.630 --> 04:00:57.690
yeah,
at a certain point people are going to be like,

3766
04:00:58.230 --> 04:01:01.680
maybe we'll have moved on and then we'll be glad that we didn't.

3767
04:01:02.580 --> 04:01:05.040
What does this h and r block?
I don't know what's going on here,

3768
04:01:05.220 --> 04:01:07.620
but you don't have that.
You're like,
there's no tomorrow.

3769
04:01:07.830 --> 04:01:10.740
You're Krusty the clown lighting a cigar with the action comics.

3770
04:01:10.741 --> 04:01:13.200
I don't want him though.
That's the thing.
I don't think I am.

3771
04:01:13.560 --> 04:01:16.870
I mean with what the,
with regard to what,
what is the rent of this place?

3772
04:01:17.160 --> 04:01:21.780
Not a lot.
That's not a lot.
I'm not telling you.

3773
04:01:23.070 --> 04:01:27.120
I don't know what you think is a lot.
It's a relative word.
It's more than five.

3774
04:01:27.300 --> 04:01:32.040
No,
it's less than five.
Way less.
Okay.
That's good.
Yeah.
It's a really nice space.

3775
04:01:32.130 --> 04:01:35.610
Yeah,
it's way less now.
I don't feel bad about you at all.
Yeah.
I actually,

3776
04:01:35.611 --> 04:01:36.960
when I saw this space,
I was like,

3777
04:01:36.990 --> 04:01:41.400
this is like you're looking at thousands and thousands.
Oh No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

3778
04:01:41.401 --> 04:01:45.110
Dov is not cheap for that kind of service.
Yeah,

3779
04:01:46.050 --> 04:01:49.650
I sure hope I didn't make you feel ridiculous.
Oh,
totally.
But she does too.

3780
04:01:50.180 --> 04:01:53.100
You just basically voiced her looks,
you know what I mean?

3781
04:01:53.730 --> 04:01:57.510
Like you just voicing up on that.
How are we going like this too?

3782
04:01:57.930 --> 04:02:00.960
But the jewelry,
which you can't really resell.
Yeah.

3783
04:02:01.050 --> 04:02:04.080
Are you going to buy more jewelry?
I just ordered a custom piece.

3784
04:02:04.890 --> 04:02:05.760
What's going on here?

3785
04:02:07.560 --> 04:02:10.750
I think that what happened is dob have a cousin or smile.

3786
04:02:13.280 --> 04:02:17.210
Let me get it.
He knows a diamond guy.
He really does.
I bet he does.

3787
04:02:17.211 --> 04:02:19.290
He want to know what's something crazy.
Should we say it or no?

3788
04:02:19.291 --> 04:02:23.140
We shouldn't say it.
I love whenever you wonder if you just say it.
No,

3789
04:02:23.150 --> 04:02:27.990
probably say it.
The,
the,
the diamond thing.
No.
Okay.

3790
04:02:29.160 --> 04:02:31.830
Yeah,
he put me in touch with someone.
Hilarious.

3791
04:02:33.240 --> 04:02:36.570
Now we're all just like,
who is another,
what is,
so I got this thing,

3792
04:02:36.571 --> 04:02:38.280
I'll just tell you.
So I got this thing.

3793
04:02:40.500 --> 04:02:45.080
So my children have college funds set up.

3794
04:02:45.870 --> 04:02:49.000
Yeah,
because once a kid,
once they're out of card,

3795
04:02:49.020 --> 04:02:51.060
how fucking conservative argue with money.

3796
04:02:52.300 --> 04:02:55.620
That's just not my trip.
That's not like,
what's not your trip?

3797
04:02:55.650 --> 04:02:59.760
Like just like having cash thrown down.
What do you do?
You don't spend anything?

3798
04:03:00.660 --> 04:03:04.860
I got a house that's a fucking big purchase on his pay off the house.

3799
04:03:04.920 --> 04:03:09.160
Have the house.
I bought my wife a car for Christmas.
That was pretty big.
Hey.

3800
04:03:09.161 --> 04:03:13.990
Okay.
Yeah.
How much was it?
She needed a car.
How much was it?
Uh,
it was,
you know,

3801
04:03:15.510 --> 04:03:19.870
it was HBO.
How dare you,
it was,
it was it over 50?

3802
04:03:20.200 --> 04:03:23.470
It was around that.
All right.
That's a nice car.
A nice car.
Way Nicer than mine.

3803
04:03:23.471 --> 04:03:28.100
Mine 30.
Oh got my wife,
nicer car.
That's nice.
That mine.

3804
04:03:28.190 --> 04:03:31.990
I know he doesn't.
And I parked it at Moshe Cassius place.

3805
04:03:32.290 --> 04:03:37.290
Kept it their secret Christmas and then I felt very Christmasy and then I knew I

3806
04:03:38.141 --> 04:03:41.020
had to get up in the middle of the night to park in the driveway,

3807
04:03:41.440 --> 04:03:45.190
put the bow on it like a nineties Lexus commercial.
All those are awesome.
Sweet.

3808
04:03:45.270 --> 04:03:49.630
So what I did was,
this is some real genius shit.
Yeah,
I couldn't set an alarm.

3809
04:03:49.631 --> 04:03:54.490
It would wake her up too.
So he just drank a fuck ton of water.
Really?

3810
04:03:54.870 --> 04:03:57.850
That was really smart of you.
I got up to,

3811
04:03:58.960 --> 04:04:02.620
I've never felt more Christmassy in my life.
And you weren't tired at all?

3812
04:04:02.950 --> 04:04:04.710
I wasn't tired of why so excited.

3813
04:04:05.350 --> 04:04:09.520
Our kid is too young to do this sort of Christmas and stuff and she also,

3814
04:04:09.550 --> 04:04:11.980
I kept telling her that I was,
she knew what car she wanted,

3815
04:04:12.670 --> 04:04:16.730
so I'm not something like Weirdo that's like all order for the lady like car.

3816
04:04:16.930 --> 04:04:19.360
So she knew what it was,
but I kept telling her I couldn't get it.

3817
04:04:19.570 --> 04:04:22.570
So at 3:00 AM got an Uber to motions house.

3818
04:04:23.230 --> 04:04:24.580
It was the best tube where I was like,

3819
04:04:24.581 --> 04:04:27.130
you're helping me be Santa Claus right now.

3820
04:04:27.160 --> 04:04:30.550
It was like I was like his third fair ever got the car drove there.

3821
04:04:30.580 --> 04:04:34.670
It was one of the best things ever.
That good money spending.

3822
04:04:35.350 --> 04:04:37.950
I know not to say yours is bad.
It did.

3823
04:04:37.990 --> 04:04:40.530
These things give you joy and they make you feel happy.
Yeah.

3824
04:04:41.050 --> 04:04:43.230
I don't think I'm like doing anything really outright.

3825
04:04:43.240 --> 04:04:44.950
I mean the jewelry is kind of crazy.

3826
04:04:44.951 --> 04:04:48.830
I admit that especially I don't really buy into jewelry.
Yeah,

3827
04:04:48.940 --> 04:04:53.250
you don't think it's just like stupid.
It's fantasy stuff though.
Who knows?

3828
04:04:53.251 --> 04:04:56.980
It's fantasy.
It's my fantasy because I grew up so,

3829
04:04:57.010 --> 04:05:02.010
so immersed and consumed by hip hop culture and music that I really wanted to be

3830
04:05:02.531 --> 04:05:07.150
one of those guys and so when I finally made enough money to buy something,

3831
04:05:07.480 --> 04:05:10.630
I just bought the stuff that I saw them where I know it's ridiculous.
You know?

3832
04:05:10.990 --> 04:05:14.500
I don't,
I,
I don't even think it's ridiculous that,
that,
that's what I'm using.

3833
04:05:14.501 --> 04:05:17.720
We're trip.
I'm like,
that's your trip.
That's all.
It's kind of ridiculous,

3834
04:05:17.721 --> 04:05:19.030
like I want to do that.
I don't think it is.

3835
04:05:19.060 --> 04:05:21.670
I mean it's a chain with my name on it and it's in diamonds.

3836
04:05:21.671 --> 04:05:24.820
Three different colors and it's got to think of my beard around it.

3837
04:05:24.910 --> 04:05:26.590
All diamonds and what do you wear it?

3838
04:05:26.620 --> 04:05:29.560
That's the thing that's up what I'm struggling with because I bought the drive

3839
04:05:29.561 --> 04:05:32.710
jacket too.
You know what I mean?
Like we're all like,
I'll get it.

3840
04:05:32.820 --> 04:05:35.940
Then you got the black one.
I've never been to war it.
Yeah,

3841
04:05:35.980 --> 04:05:39.100
the way it's an a goodwill.
So really of course thing,
right?

3842
04:05:39.500 --> 04:05:41.800
How much stuff do you need?
How much?
What else?

3843
04:05:41.940 --> 04:05:45.100
I mean what the Alberta it goes up.
I'm not that crazy.
Right?
I mean,

3844
04:05:45.101 --> 04:05:46.420
am I really that crazy with stuff?

3845
04:05:46.960 --> 04:05:50.350
I just jewelry specifically where they're just like,

3846
04:05:50.351 --> 04:05:54.010
we're going to call these metals more big mistake

3847
04:05:55.510 --> 04:05:59.440
when it starts to get fun,
and this is just a psychological thing.

3848
04:05:59.620 --> 04:06:03.190
When you look in the closet and you realize you're buying the same stuff over

3849
04:06:03.191 --> 04:06:06.640
and over and you're not enjoying,
but here's what you got.

3850
04:06:07.160 --> 04:06:09.060
That's the stuff that you kind of get like,
yeah,

3851
04:06:09.070 --> 04:06:12.910
but I'm saying that's not problematic,
right?
Like it's not like if you're like,

3852
04:06:13.240 --> 04:06:16.280
man,
you keep buying the sweatshirt,
the psychology

3853
04:06:16.280 --> 04:06:20.720
<v 20>of it,
of what are you and already enjoying the hedonic treadmill.
There you go.</v>

3854
04:06:21.050 --> 04:06:22.100
You know what hedonism is,

3855
04:06:22.101 --> 04:06:26.420
obviously it's enjoying the centers and the hedonic treadmill is the idea that

3856
04:06:26.660 --> 04:06:29.620
you'll just want the next thing and the next thing and the next thing and the

3857
04:06:29.630 --> 04:06:32.570
next thing.
And it's not to say that you can't enjoy it,

3858
04:06:32.571 --> 04:06:37.070
but there is an addictive quality to any sort of,
I mean in a certain sense,

3859
04:06:37.071 --> 04:06:40.930
this guy is chasing the next amazing orgasms he has.

3860
04:06:40.940 --> 04:06:42.440
In the same way I want them to get it,

3861
04:06:42.441 --> 04:06:46.370
that we're sort of chasing that feeling that you get sometimes.

3862
04:06:46.550 --> 04:06:49.010
You know what it is.
It's,
it's similar to drugs.
Like for me,

3863
04:06:49.011 --> 04:06:52.580
I don't smoke a lot of pot,
barely ever,
but every time I do I'm like,

3864
04:06:52.640 --> 04:06:54.800
this isn't it.
And I recently stopped drinking for a recent,

3865
04:06:54.920 --> 04:06:58.040
for similar reasons was you were always looking for that one.

3866
04:06:58.850 --> 04:07:03.850
You are chasing that one time that you were in fucking Montreal and you didn't

3867
04:07:04.221 --> 04:07:04.731
plan it,

3868
04:07:04.731 --> 04:07:08.820
but it started to rain and you and your friend duct in some cafe and you realize

3869
04:07:08.821 --> 04:07:12.860
you didn't have anything to do all day until like noon the next day.

3870
04:07:13.040 --> 04:07:15.620
So you're like,
fuck it,
let's get Martinis and and,

3871
04:07:15.650 --> 04:07:20.600
and the feeling of novelty and spontaneity gets blended and the feeling of

3872
04:07:20.601 --> 04:07:24.530
travel gets mixed in to the Martinis.
You know what I'm saying?

3873
04:07:24.920 --> 04:07:28.850
But our stupid AYP brains go martinis mean that feeling,

3874
04:07:29.030 --> 04:07:32.210
but the next time you have them you realize that it was a cacophony.

3875
04:07:32.211 --> 04:07:36.260
It was a mosaic of feelings that we're chasing.
And that's how I feel about weed.

3876
04:07:36.261 --> 04:07:38.740
I smoked weed and I'm like,
it makes me happy.
It makes me say like,

3877
04:07:38.900 --> 04:07:41.720
or even coffee makes my,
my mood elevate.

3878
04:07:41.870 --> 04:07:45.800
Does it or was your mood just there and you were too tired to even notice and

3879
04:07:45.801 --> 04:07:48.930
that kind of woke you up a little bit?
Like nothing is bad.

3880
04:07:49.900 --> 04:07:54.140
It gets what I'm doing right now.
What?
I'm canceling the order on that.

3881
04:07:54.141 --> 04:07:55.550
A piece of jewelry right now

3882
04:07:57.450 --> 04:08:00.570
I feel like it's just silly that my kid can go to private school and Maury here

3883
04:08:00.720 --> 04:08:04.370
what?
What's,
what's more interesting is what actually does give fulfillment.

3884
04:08:04.400 --> 04:08:07.910
Anybody can come and say we're addicted to our phones or we're on that Donek

3885
04:08:07.911 --> 04:08:12.340
treadmill or we're all chasing the next high.
But unfortunately like it's,

3886
04:08:12.440 --> 04:08:14.410
it's sometimes harder to get a handle on what,

3887
04:08:14.510 --> 04:08:16.640
I'm sure your family makes you really happy.

3888
04:08:17.690 --> 04:08:22.690
My family of origin but my children clearly same hashtag same talking with

3889
04:08:22.881 --> 04:08:26.360
people like I,
I'm very happy right now cause I'm seeing you guys,

3890
04:08:26.361 --> 04:08:27.410
I'm talking with you guys.

3891
04:08:27.770 --> 04:08:30.530
That's what I think is really interesting about podcasting is that like we've

3892
04:08:30.531 --> 04:08:35.030
gone so far into the future that we've just circled back where like what did

3893
04:08:35.031 --> 04:08:40.031
people like the fucking 1,602 they just sat around and talking shit natural.

3894
04:08:40.130 --> 04:08:40.880
We're doing,

3895
04:08:40.880 --> 04:08:43.700
we record it and I understand people share it and they're listening and they're

3896
04:08:43.701 --> 04:08:46.700
a part of it in their way.
But like we're doing the same thing.

3897
04:08:46.701 --> 04:08:50.150
Our ancestors and the same things,
the same basic things make us happy.

3898
04:08:50.151 --> 04:08:52.550
It's like being with other people.
It was a big one.

3899
04:08:52.610 --> 04:08:55.940
I'm getting this from the movie.
Happy by the way.
Yeah,
it's a great documentary.

3900
04:08:56.150 --> 04:08:58.970
Being with other people is a huge one.
Communal things.

3901
04:08:59.000 --> 04:09:01.670
Eating with other people is hugely important.

3902
04:09:02.120 --> 04:09:05.300
I can make fun of Mcdonald's but actually that is one of the services they
offer.

3903
04:09:05.301 --> 04:09:07.040
Especially lower income people.

3904
04:09:07.070 --> 04:09:10.670
Mcdonald's gives people sometimes a place to like gather.

3905
04:09:10.700 --> 04:09:13.380
She sacrificed then it just could have been so great.
Keep going.

3906
04:09:13.560 --> 04:09:16.860
Morton's Morton's is also a place you can get.
There you go.

3907
04:09:16.980 --> 04:09:19.920
But also fuck Mcdonald's because they're poisoning those people.
Thank you.

3908
04:09:19.930 --> 04:09:21.810
An addicting them to those foods with chemicals.

3909
04:09:21.970 --> 04:09:25.350
But you're still welcome back if we can figure it out.

3910
04:09:29.220 --> 04:09:31.590
The other thing,
and I think you guys are both gonna like this,

3911
04:09:31.860 --> 04:09:36.320
that's key to happiness is flow is something that takes you outside of time.
Yes,

3912
04:09:36.330 --> 04:09:40.020
so they actually interviewed people that are like fry cooks on the line and a

3913
04:09:40.021 --> 04:09:44.000
busy Manhattan restaurant.
Very happy people because they'd have like five,

3914
04:09:44.040 --> 04:09:46.440
not all of them obviously,
but they'd have like four hours,

3915
04:09:46.530 --> 04:09:50.160
three hours of a rush at during the day where they're getting outside of our

3916
04:09:50.161 --> 04:09:51.540
minds.
You talked to standup,

3917
04:09:51.570 --> 04:09:55.080
so one of the first things we say we like about standup is the time disappears

3918
04:09:55.710 --> 04:09:57.930
and you disappear,
you disappear in,

3919
04:09:57.931 --> 04:10:01.770
the audience disappears and it becomes a show.
This is timeless space,

3920
04:10:01.890 --> 04:10:03.870
so you're kind of getting the best of both worlds.

3921
04:10:04.080 --> 04:10:08.550
It's not as shallow as being like they heard me and they left,
and don king big,

3922
04:10:08.840 --> 04:10:10.920
which is reduce it to that,

3923
04:10:10.921 --> 04:10:14.610
and documentaries of comedians agree or chasing the high of a laugh.

3924
04:10:14.610 --> 04:10:18.030
It's like it's a little bit more complicated.
Absolutely.
Some of them are,

3925
04:10:18.031 --> 04:10:21.900
and you can tell me who those people are and then there are others that are
like,

3926
04:10:21.901 --> 04:10:24.860
wow,
I was really just locked in a moment and part of something.

3927
04:10:24.870 --> 04:10:28.050
You feel like you're connected more.
Absolutely.
And you do feel like,

3928
04:10:28.860 --> 04:10:31.290
I don't know,
I think like after a great show especially,
you're like,

3929
04:10:31.291 --> 04:10:34.140
that was it for you.
You're like,
that was an experience.
That's right.
Yeah.

3930
04:10:34.560 --> 04:10:38.880
And a timeless one.
Yeah.
And then it's weird because it is so ego driven,

3931
04:10:39.120 --> 04:10:41.220
but you sort of lose the sense of Pete,

3932
04:10:41.221 --> 04:10:44.820
it becomes like we are here doing the same thing together.

3933
04:10:45.000 --> 04:10:48.750
So one of the reasons why it's not as effective on TV,
right?
It's really,

3934
04:10:48.920 --> 04:10:51.720
it's about the live show.
It's like Avatar,
remember Avatar,

3935
04:10:51.721 --> 04:10:55.320
where they're holding hands on the tree.
We crave that sort of stuff.
It's fine.

3936
04:10:55.350 --> 04:10:57.990
We can either resist that or just be like,
look,

3937
04:10:57.991 --> 04:11:01.200
we're stuck in these embarrassing meat puppets and there are certain things that

3938
04:11:01.201 --> 04:11:02.034
make us feel good.

3939
04:11:02.250 --> 04:11:05.190
The thing that I'm talking about with jewelry and stuff is like when,

3940
04:11:05.191 --> 04:11:07.040
when our behavior is being uh,

3941
04:11:07.260 --> 04:11:11.940
given to us by someone else's story of success,
you know what I'm saying?

3942
04:11:12.480 --> 04:11:14.250
I narrative was sold to us.

3943
04:11:14.251 --> 04:11:17.100
Whether it is alcohol or food or jewelry or a new car.

3944
04:11:17.101 --> 04:11:20.730
I know I just bought a new car and there is some joy to be found in those
things.

3945
04:11:21.030 --> 04:11:25.590
But like we need to be sharing,
making sure that we're,
we're writing our story,

3946
04:11:25.620 --> 04:11:28.830
you know what I mean?
Not just going like,
well,
this is what they told us it was,

3947
04:11:28.831 --> 04:11:32.470
because guess what,
as someone who's had all my dreams come true,
I'll tell you,

3948
04:11:32.471 --> 04:11:35.520
you get there and you're still fucking there.
Yeah.
And you've got to find that.

3949
04:11:35.521 --> 04:11:37.730
You've got to find it with your friends.
You got to find it with your family.

3950
04:11:37.740 --> 04:11:40.860
What do you do to make yourself,
you know,
find it more.

3951
04:11:41.520 --> 04:11:43.020
It's what we're talking about just by,

3952
04:11:43.050 --> 04:11:46.560
just by deeply connecting with other people in a sincere way.

3953
04:11:46.890 --> 04:11:49.410
And that's why we were joking about publicists and stuff.

3954
04:11:49.710 --> 04:11:53.970
It does kind of bother me to think that you're paying somebody to love you.

3955
04:11:54.240 --> 04:11:57.210
This is,
this is,
this is a,
um,
who wrote,
um,

3956
04:11:57.300 --> 04:12:01.710
fucking blanking on his name and the name of the book who wrote Infinite Jest.

3957
04:12:04.350 --> 04:12:07.530
Somebody listening is going nuts right now.
Anyway,
it'll come to me.

3958
04:12:08.400 --> 04:12:12.220
He was talking about once we get to the place where we can have three

3959
04:12:12.221 --> 04:12:16.960
dimensional internet,
virtual reality pornography,
it'll basically be Wally.

3960
04:12:17.080 --> 04:12:21.720
Remember Wally,
I didn't see that movie.
We're just going to be blobs.
Ah,
screens.

3961
04:12:21.850 --> 04:12:26.170
Getting all of your senses,
Matt,
every,
every you have will be scratched.

3962
04:12:26.350 --> 04:12:30.310
So you want to fuck Tyra banks.
You can do it.
We have the equipment now.

3963
04:12:30.490 --> 04:12:34.190
You'll do it.
It'll,
it'll fool basically there.
Right?
We're pretty much there.

3964
04:12:34.191 --> 04:12:37.270
Yeah.
But here's the rub.
It's the same with Mcdonald's.

3965
04:12:37.271 --> 04:12:38.440
It's the same with pornography.

3966
04:12:38.441 --> 04:12:40.090
And it's the same with the jewelry that you bought.

3967
04:12:40.330 --> 04:12:43.790
You're having these things met by people who don't love you.
That's,

3968
04:12:43.830 --> 04:12:45.240
that's what's fucked up,
right?

3969
04:12:45.280 --> 04:12:48.490
So we're paying for something that not only should be free,

3970
04:12:48.730 --> 04:12:52.060
but only actually occurs when it's free.
You know what I'm saying?

3971
04:12:52.061 --> 04:12:54.940
If your wife makes you a sandwich or you make a kid a sandwich,

3972
04:12:55.120 --> 04:12:56.800
there really is something going on there.

3973
04:12:56.801 --> 04:13:00.100
There's intention and there's a drive behind it that's pure.

3974
04:13:00.310 --> 04:13:04.900
And what we're losing touch with as human beings is,
yeah,
I can have,

3975
04:13:04.960 --> 04:13:06.310
I'm wealthy enough.

3976
04:13:06.520 --> 04:13:10.480
I'm very fortunate to have grub hub bring me every fucking meal.

3977
04:13:10.840 --> 04:13:14.440
I want Thai for lunch,
and I want back in Morton's for dinner.

3978
04:13:14.800 --> 04:13:18.190
I'll have him bring it to me and I can do this infinitely,
you know?

3979
04:13:18.220 --> 04:13:21.400
Or I could make some boring ass pasta dish.

3980
04:13:21.401 --> 04:13:22.930
I don't know how to cook a lot of things,

3981
04:13:23.140 --> 04:13:26.980
which is what I made my wife last night.
That is the better choice.
Yeah,

3982
04:13:26.981 --> 04:13:30.390
I'm doing it.
You know this,
we know this,
right?
It's a,

3983
04:13:30.420 --> 04:13:33.880
it's the same part of you that's like you're feeling depressed.
Go for a hike,

3984
04:13:33.910 --> 04:13:36.280
go for a walk.
Even if I know you don't want to,

3985
04:13:36.520 --> 04:13:41.110
you need to realize that you're negotiating with an ape and you have to rise

3986
04:13:41.111 --> 04:13:41.910
above it

3987
04:13:41.910 --> 04:13:46.830
<v 0>and also too in this,
I mean the hedonic thing,
you're also chasing the next high,</v>

3988
04:13:46.831 --> 04:13:47.101
right?

3989
04:13:47.101 --> 04:13:52.080
It's also the fear of the space in between of feeling like my,

3990
04:13:52.100 --> 04:13:55.860
have you read the subtle art of not giving a fuck?
Yeah.
He talks about that like,

3991
04:13:55.861 --> 04:13:59.910
hey,
life is kind of suffering some.
You know what I mean?

3992
04:13:59.911 --> 04:14:04.770
It is kind of going through this stuff and we're so afraid of that quiet moment

3993
04:14:04.771 --> 04:14:08.160
in between the next fun thing.
What am I going to eat?
What am I going to do?

3994
04:14:08.190 --> 04:14:11.790
Like we're constantly looking for that next fix.
Well,
obviously exhausting.

3995
04:14:11.820 --> 04:14:15.200
That book is a little bit about Buddhism.
It's basically,
it is,
yeah.
This

3996
04:14:15.200 --> 04:14:19.880
<v 20>book and for me,
enlightenment.
Uh,
if you want to talk about that,</v>

3997
04:14:19.910 --> 04:14:23.060
this on your mom's house,
we could,
you might have a fart that I can bring in.

3998
04:14:23.061 --> 04:14:25.130
We can get it enlightened that baby.

3999
04:14:25.630 --> 04:14:27.800
But this is actually is not too philosophical.

4000
04:14:27.801 --> 04:14:29.780
Not too heady and certainly not really.
No,
it's great.

4001
04:14:29.800 --> 04:14:31.640
There's something that I practice,

4002
04:14:31.641 --> 04:14:34.520
which is you're trying to be enlightenment to me means happy for no reason.

4003
04:14:35.000 --> 04:14:37.640
And there in my experience,
you can,

4004
04:14:38.090 --> 04:14:40.880
every story is a guy sitting on a box.

4005
04:14:40.910 --> 04:14:44.150
Every spiritual story is the guy sitting on a box and he's begging for change.

4006
04:14:44.390 --> 04:14:47.360
And finally one guy goes,
hey,
what's,
what's in the box?
He goes,
you know,

4007
04:14:47.361 --> 04:14:49.070
I never looked in the box.
He's like,
you should look in the box.

4008
04:14:49.290 --> 04:14:51.890
Kind of walks away.
Beggar looks in the box is filled with gold,
right?

4009
04:14:52.070 --> 04:14:55.130
That's every story.
You go on a journey looking for a diamond,

4010
04:14:55.250 --> 04:14:57.980
only to realize it was sewn into the lining of your jacket the whole time.

4011
04:14:57.981 --> 04:15:02.510
This is every movie,
right?
The human story.
So why do we,

4012
04:15:02.511 --> 04:15:05.900
why do we love that story and why does that story keeping told?
It's because,

4013
04:15:05.901 --> 04:15:08.270
and I'm starting,
I'm 39 years old and finally starting,

4014
04:15:08.271 --> 04:15:09.560
it's finally starting sink in.

4015
04:15:09.860 --> 04:15:12.950
But there is something to enjoy just in the moment,

4016
04:15:12.951 --> 04:15:17.150
just in the phenomenon of being conscious and you can call that conscious a

4017
04:15:17.151 --> 04:15:18.530
piece of God or whatever you want to say.

4018
04:15:18.531 --> 04:15:22.220
It doesn't matter what symbol system you use,
but when you go,

4019
04:15:22.550 --> 04:15:27.550
just this just right now is a fucking trip and even the suffering is fucking why

4020
04:15:29.550 --> 04:15:33.230
you should even be here.
But,
and there's a way to intellectualize that.

4021
04:15:33.231 --> 04:15:37.670
That's exhausting where I go like,
wow,
coffee's a fucking miracle.

4022
04:15:37.850 --> 04:15:39.650
That's exhausting.
That's head stuff.

4023
04:15:39.860 --> 04:15:43.190
It's about being in a heart place where you're just not thinking where you're

4024
04:15:43.191 --> 04:15:45.890
letting it shut off and you're just going like,
like I was in the shower.

4025
04:15:45.891 --> 04:15:47.810
Here's a simple one.
It's in the shower this morning and go,

4026
04:15:47.900 --> 04:15:51.470
this could be your last shower.
We don't know.
I could fucking die.

4027
04:15:51.860 --> 04:15:54.440
And that sounds more of it,
but there's something when you go,

4028
04:15:54.560 --> 04:15:55.970
this could be my last shower.

4029
04:15:56.120 --> 04:16:00.950
You feel the water on your skin and you smell the soap and there's something and

4030
04:16:00.951 --> 04:16:05.090
you see the sun coming through the window and the speck of dust that's caught in

4031
04:16:05.091 --> 04:16:06.950
it and how it looks like our universe,

4032
04:16:07.220 --> 04:16:11.090
and that's not thinking that looks like our universe.
That's feeling it.

4033
04:16:11.390 --> 04:16:15.200
That's true happiness.
It's not to say better or worse,

4034
04:16:15.201 --> 04:16:17.720
it's just to me happy for no reason.

4035
04:16:17.721 --> 04:16:21.480
Is there a better way to vibrating but plugin,
that's a,

4036
04:16:22.770 --> 04:16:25.430
yeah,
I had one and we can laugh.

4037
04:16:26.280 --> 04:16:28.940
We can also laugh at that because it's fucking crazy.

4038
04:16:28.941 --> 04:16:31.060
Let's not deny what we're also doing here.
Also,

4039
04:16:31.640 --> 04:16:35.310
I'm horny and I'm watching fucking weird MILF born and yeah,

4040
04:16:35.311 --> 04:16:37.160
it just like everybody,
we're all in the slog,

4041
04:16:37.490 --> 04:16:41.060
but what the subtle art of not giving a fuck is kind of talking about is the

4042
04:16:41.061 --> 04:16:45.710
idea of non attachment.
Even write this fucking conundrum.

4043
04:16:46.310 --> 04:16:48.890
You know,
you think you have free will skip breakfast,

4044
04:16:48.891 --> 04:16:51.200
lunch and dinner for two days and then have a lot of coffee.

4045
04:16:51.290 --> 04:16:53.660
You know what I mean?
Like it's embarrassing that we're stuck in these,

4046
04:16:53.661 --> 04:16:56.690
but we can have compassion and this is really this idea for yourself.

4047
04:16:56.750 --> 04:17:01.130
You can have compassion for the part of you that even recognizes the part of you

4048
04:17:01.190 --> 04:17:03.580
that wants to buy jewelry.
It's okay.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

4049
04:17:03.620 --> 04:17:06.020
But there's also a lightness that we can go about these things

4050
04:17:06.140 --> 04:17:09.680
<v 5>you go,
it's,
it's also like,
it's,
it's,
it's when you go,</v>

4051
04:17:09.710 --> 04:17:11.900
I really truly are,

4052
04:17:12.410 --> 04:17:15.380
you accept that there's versions of yourself.
Yeah.

4053
04:17:15.410 --> 04:17:18.470
Aren't like a perfect and a one.

4054
04:17:18.471 --> 04:17:22.070
And then when you accept it is when you actually feel cool and enlightened and

4055
04:17:22.071 --> 04:17:25.610
that's right and happy about it.
I had this thing like a week or two ago,

4056
04:17:25.940 --> 04:17:29.270
just felt [inaudible] I think it's kind of like the moment you're describing

4057
04:17:29.271 --> 04:17:33.980
where I just felt extreme gratitude for my life,
just like my whole life.

4058
04:17:34.000 --> 04:17:37.700
I remember this day and I'm waiting for this moment.
You know it,

4059
04:17:38.170 --> 04:17:40.880
I think I it,
no,
I just thought,
you know,

4060
04:17:40.881 --> 04:17:45.500
I just feel like I just felt extremely like thankful for my life,

4061
04:17:45.501 --> 04:17:49.310
for my wife,
for my children,
for just the life that I get to live,

4062
04:17:49.311 --> 04:17:52.970
that I get to do this for a living like Jesus piece.
Yeah.
My Jesus piece,

4063
04:17:53.000 --> 04:17:57.220
all of it.
And I just was overwhelmed honestly,
by thinking of the,

4064
04:17:57.260 --> 04:17:59.450
like feeling the gratitude and just thinking of it.

4065
04:17:59.690 --> 04:18:03.860
All it did was tell my spouse about it.
I felt extremely like,
just happy,

4066
04:18:03.861 --> 04:18:07.280
just so overjoyed.
Yeah.
Rest of my gratitude.

4067
04:18:08.510 --> 04:18:09.570
<v 20>A lot of like times it's,</v>

4068
04:18:09.580 --> 04:18:13.050
it's are alcoholics and drug addicts that know the benefit of a gratitude list.

4069
04:18:13.080 --> 04:18:17.580
Yeah.
But that is absolutely one of the keys to happiness,
physical activity,

4070
04:18:17.581 --> 04:18:21.570
human contact flow in gratitude.
And it does.
And you know what?

4071
04:18:21.571 --> 04:18:25.590
It doesn't even have to be fancy stuff.
Yeah.
I go on a hike.
There's three,

4072
04:18:25.650 --> 04:18:28.680
there's three phases of the hike.
One is a gratitude list.

4073
04:18:28.681 --> 04:18:31.950
So let's say it's a 15 minute walk.
The first five minutes.

4074
04:18:31.951 --> 04:18:35.160
You just think about what you're grateful for and and you basically,

4075
04:18:35.161 --> 04:18:38.550
it doesn't have to be fancy.
You can be like,
I'm grateful for my hands.
Yes,

4076
04:18:38.670 --> 04:18:42.930
it can be some bullshit.
I'm grateful for having a car that Mary has a car.

4077
04:18:43.230 --> 04:18:45.570
I'm grateful that I have a place to sleep.
I'm grateful for food.

4078
04:18:45.840 --> 04:18:48.600
Then if you run out of stuff,
think about the people that you're grateful for.

4079
04:18:48.600 --> 04:18:51.930
Believe me,
this is way more than five minutes.
Where the second five,

4080
04:18:51.931 --> 04:18:52.531
I'm trying to think.

4081
04:18:52.531 --> 04:18:55.650
It's been a while since I did this because honestly it's the first one that

4082
04:18:55.720 --> 04:19:00.120
matters.
The first is next five is you think about how you want your day to go.

4083
04:19:00.680 --> 04:19:03.480
Usually do this in the morning and it makes a huge difference.
I can't.

4084
04:19:04.110 --> 04:19:08.280
I believe that all the first five is affirmations.
If you let the mind take you,

4085
04:19:08.281 --> 04:19:11.460
your whole day is fucked up.
That's what I'm saying.
Take your mind.

4086
04:19:11.580 --> 04:19:14.610
That's what I'm saying,
but that is real happiness.
What you're saying,

4087
04:19:14.640 --> 04:19:16.950
and this is a,
this isn't mystical idea,

4088
04:19:17.220 --> 04:19:21.620
is the idea of not identifying with the mind.
That is the motherfucker.

4089
04:19:21.660 --> 04:19:25.530
If you wanted to boil down all of spirituality into something that's actually

4090
04:19:25.531 --> 04:19:29.100
practical,
that doesn't require you to believe anything.
I don't give a fuck.

4091
04:19:29.101 --> 04:19:31.680
If you believe in God,
who gives a fuck?
What are we talking about?

4092
04:19:31.681 --> 04:19:34.080
You're wasting my time.
Let's talk about something real.

4093
04:19:34.380 --> 04:19:36.030
It's not identifying with your brain,

4094
04:19:36.031 --> 04:19:38.280
it's identifying what the part of you that's listening to your brain.

4095
04:19:38.490 --> 04:19:39.840
My last special dirty,
clean,

4096
04:19:39.841 --> 04:19:43.020
I did a bit about this where I had people sing a song in their head and I'm
like,

4097
04:19:43.021 --> 04:19:45.870
who's hearing that?
That's kind of a nudge towards,

4098
04:19:46.110 --> 04:19:49.050
you could call it soul consciousness or just basic awareness.

4099
04:19:49.350 --> 04:19:53.070
Just the idea that who you are is really the thing that's hearing the thoughts

4100
04:19:53.310 --> 04:19:56.130
and the more I used to like as a Christian,

4101
04:19:56.131 --> 04:19:58.770
I would want peace to exist in my mind.

4102
04:19:58.830 --> 04:20:02.210
I want it to exist in my ego and then I realized through meditation and all

4103
04:20:02.220 --> 04:20:07.100
these different practices you want to identify with the part that's impartial on

4104
04:20:07.101 --> 04:20:11.790
born and just watching that sort of stuff.
That's where peace was hiding.

4105
04:20:11.940 --> 04:20:14.700
It wasn't hiding in thoughts like,
please give me,
please,

4106
04:20:14.730 --> 04:20:16.270
please help me calm down.
It was,

4107
04:20:16.290 --> 04:20:19.710
it was witnessing who's noticing the lack of peace.

4108
04:20:20.190 --> 04:20:24.420
It's fucking based when you got into it.
That's it.
And anyone can get there.

4109
04:20:24.421 --> 04:20:25.590
You don't have to meditate.

4110
04:20:25.800 --> 04:20:28.380
You can slip into that space at any moment that you want.

4111
04:20:28.620 --> 04:20:31.200
When you're having too many thoughts,
you go,
who's noticing the thoughts?

4112
04:20:31.480 --> 04:20:36.480
That's that's the summation of thousands of years as weird mystical writings

4113
04:20:37.321 --> 04:20:42.300
that Gandalf controller over you are so insightful and I'm serious,
bright,

4114
04:20:42.301 --> 04:20:47.010
articulate.
I mean this guy,
he's really surprising.
I didn't think I know.

4115
04:20:47.011 --> 04:20:51.210
Second Grade.
Are you wrapping up?
We are.
We are.

4116
04:20:51.960 --> 04:20:56.910
Um,
we've uh,
we've spent a lot of time.
I'm so,
can I say this on here?

4117
04:20:56.940 --> 04:21:00.900
Yeah.
I had crashed and coming out and my special come out.
Really?

4118
04:21:00.901 --> 04:21:02.180
We're here to promote crashing.
Yeah.

4119
04:21:02.610 --> 04:21:05.980
That is something I am grateful for that I could reach out.
You have

4120
04:21:05.980 --> 04:21:08.740
<v 19>this wonderful popular show.
I know I gave you a hard time for renting a space.</v>

4121
04:21:08.760 --> 04:21:11.590
No,
it's all good of this.
Love the show.
Love that you have,

4122
04:21:11.770 --> 04:21:13.240
that this is working for you guys.

4123
04:21:13.510 --> 04:21:16.510
And the fact that they in the Dov and everybody bent over to make this happen,

4124
04:21:16.540 --> 04:21:19.150
that's means a lot.
And that's what crashing is about.

4125
04:21:19.450 --> 04:21:21.490
But when we have that in our community,

4126
04:21:21.670 --> 04:21:24.440
then we're hanging out with the right people.
That's right.
You know what I mean?

4127
04:21:24.441 --> 04:21:28.600
Now it's not the other people that go,
he fucking stole my essence.
Yeah.
Yeah.

4128
04:21:31.330 --> 04:21:35.770
Agreed.
Agreed.
Sorry.
This hate Sundays on Hbo,

4129
04:21:35.771 --> 04:21:40.240
10:00 PM to don't look at the graphic on Pete's Twitter page.

4130
04:21:40.360 --> 04:21:44.550
It is Sunday 10 publicist to update that.
Oh,
I'm glad.

4131
04:21:45.610 --> 04:21:49.630
I'm thankful.
I want to give so gratitude for all of you to everybody,

4132
04:21:49.631 --> 04:21:53.470
but Mcdonald's.
Ah.
Um,
dude,

4133
04:21:54.620 --> 04:21:59.170
Try Ndz might be wearing little king hats next week.
Yeah,
but king hats,

4134
04:21:59.260 --> 04:22:02.910
crowns,
Paula Thomas Joe it,
that's his joke.
Oh yeah.

4135
04:22:02.920 --> 04:22:06.140
Then he worked in a hat store.
Paul,
I have Tompkin said he worked in a hat store,

4136
04:22:06.150 --> 04:22:08.650
so it was like,
let me get the,
let me get that king hat.
And he's like,

4137
04:22:08.651 --> 04:22:11.870
you know what?
It's called
the crown.
It's ground

4138
04:22:14.190 --> 04:22:18.740
had royale.
I heard it though.
I had gotten as a king yet.
Um,

4139
04:22:18.840 --> 04:22:19.331
the king,

4140
04:22:19.331 --> 04:22:24.331
it's the king and this is a home here now by grass king's homes.

4141
04:22:25.090 --> 04:22:27.580
And I'm again,
thank you very much.

4142
04:22:30.240 --> 04:22:33.310
I really don't know what that is,
but,
um,
it was a lot of fun,
man.

4143
04:22:33.311 --> 04:22:35.530
Thank you for coming.
[inaudible] means a lot.

4144
04:23:06.790 --> 04:23:07.623
<v 8>Gotcha.</v>

4145
04:23:08.990 --> 04:23:12.710
John Black Guy at 2195.

4146
04:23:21.120 --> 04:23:22.460
