<v 0>barely holding shit together,

12
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.300

We got a new life coming pretty soon.
It is true.

Here we go.

57
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.810
<v 5>So this would probably be my most popular service out of all the services I do.</v>

58
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.950
Am I most erotic service?

61
00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.430
<v 0>Happy Birthday.
Big Boy.
Who's on your shirt today?
Yeah.</v>

62
00:04:16.431 --> 00:04:20.150
Rest in peace.
Be Aig.
Be 46 today.
I ain't crazy.
Wow.

63
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.330
Think about how much that guy did and how much he ate.

64
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.600
Terrible.
He's here.
He's really fat.
He was,
he was amazing.
Amazing lyricist.
Ah,

65
00:04:29.601 --> 00:04:34.570
the Great Sam triple snaps.
46 big.
Can you imagine that?

66
00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.750
Can't believe that.
I mean,

67
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.700
he was so good and all that was put out by like 23 yeah,

68
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.960
because I feel like he died in 96 I want to say.
Yeah,
it was like early,

69
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.270
so he was fucking 24 25

70
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.360
it's crazy.
I wouldn't even understand that power.

71
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.850
I would flame throat everything.

72
00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.240
I would only be able to play Reno because I burned every bridge and like socks.

73
00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:06.290
Man.
That was stupid.
I know,
but that's a stupid,

74
00:05:06.291 --> 00:05:11.291
you're a whole new appreciation for fame and success at a really early on.

75
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.300
Like when I see,
I couldn't understand it to 1819 year olds.

76
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.190
Everybody be pregnant.
You're like,
oh my God.
No.

77
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.560
But that would have run through all the money.
All of it.
All of it.

78
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.300
All of it.
At 23 you've earned $30 billion.
I'd be like,
after that 45 yeah,

79
00:05:29.301 --> 00:05:33.260
I'd be red.
Foxing it at like 24 IRS becoming in,

80
00:05:33.261 --> 00:05:37.910
grabbing white tigers out of my house.
Yeah.
Did he,
did he spend like that?
Oh,

81
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.910
oh yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know if he got tigers,
but just buying crazy shit.

82
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.700
He,
oh that's so good.
Boy.
He got his success later in life.

83
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:51.200
I have a theory that black comedians go nuts.
Okay,
let's save this data later on.

84
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.850
Later on.
Okay,
cool.
Here's yet another example.

85
00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:01.430
I go down rabbit holiday for later.
Yeah.
Yeah.

86
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.920
Black can meet.
Sorry,
what was it?
Black comedians go crazy.
Go croquet.
Okay.

87
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.530
This is yet another example of guys acting like they're running a legit

88
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:16.220
business.
Sexual going,
nothing sexual.
Totally.

89
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:18.620
To get your dick hard.
Yeah.
Oh,
so this is a,

90
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.810
it's all about jizzing on some naked barber

91
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.850
<v 6>hitting in the running service cause he used the same</v>

92
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:35.060
<v 0>clippers on both parts like her head.
And your asshole.
I sure hope so.</v>

93
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.320
I'd be like,
Hey,

94
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.220
can you use whatever you use to to shave that guy's balls on my face right now

95
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:41.054
for my beard?
Yeah.

96
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.290
<v 6>Did you want my naked for this?</v>

97
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:45.190
Obviously I'm the naked and he's just walking around with those.

98
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.400
He's always ready to go get a lot of guys that

99
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.150
not that well hung.
They don't want to feel intimidated.

100
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.780
What I would call an average flight.
You get your ass home

101
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.350
<v 0>bleach if you have nipple rings.
Am I right?
Oh,
for sure.
Oh wait,</v>

102
00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:06.920
I missed what he said.
Did he say that he considers himself average?

103
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.220
Is that what he said is like in great shape,
but what?
What does he say?

104
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.170
<v 6>How long?
They don't want to feel intimidated being in what I would call it.</v>

105
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.730
Average flow is probably a lot better than if I was some funky model.

106
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.580
Oh yeah.
Steroids,
body and big Dick.

107
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.280
<v 0>So,
oh,
he's saying that he's average,
which is,
you know,</v>

108
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.860
like makes people feel at ease

109
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.690
<v 6>when you're doing ass in general.
To waxing,</v>

110
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.410
you have to add a beautician or anything.

111
00:07:35.411 --> 00:07:38.740
You have to get in these different areas.
Look at this shit.

112
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:44.250
This is not what women do that I've always imagined what you girls do.

113
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.880
I just got waxed and I go,
how do you do the ball hole?
Shit.
There's this,

114
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.130
they put you in a swing and then just get in there.
Yeah.
Here's

115
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.700
<v 0>the thing.
Heterosexual women who have the exact service done,</v>

116
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:59.890
they don't put you in a fuck swing and a leather daddy with a hat and a harness.

117
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.780
Does it do wearing a jockstrap?

118
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.580
I'm just always amazed how the gay guys look so alike.

119
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:11.800
It's like you're just going fuck by yourself.
Right?
It's so weird.
Yeah.

120
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.750
They look alike and they are.

121
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.470
The truth is this dude called himself in average shape.
He's an average shape,
uh,

122
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:24.250
for,
for his world.
For a gay guy.
Yeah.
He's sloppy,
right?

123
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.750
Yeah.
For us,
it's like fucking workout.
Tom Wright always coming up.

124
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.530
This would be like a shredded body.
I'd be like,
Hey,

125
00:08:32.531 --> 00:08:34.440
$1 million to have this too.

126
00:08:34.441 --> 00:08:37.340
He'd be one of those dudes just always hanging out with his shirt off and you're

127
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.950
like fuck and a yeah,

128
00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:41.860
and you can ask it something and it actually makes me feel like shit that he

129
00:08:41.861 --> 00:08:45.920
called himself average Logan.
I mean God,
my gay friend,
uh,

130
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.550
and Portland we,
he talks about all the time,
he's like,

131
00:08:48.551 --> 00:08:52.870
you have such low standards.
Women,
straight women for heterosexual man.
He's like,

132
00:08:52.871 --> 00:08:56.040
it would never fly in our community when you guys is acceptable

133
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.160
<v 7>and they're children of the corn dude.
Once you like age out,</v>

134
00:08:59.161 --> 00:09:02.230
you're like abandoned.
No,
not anymore.

135
00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:06.930
It's different up there cause he's,
he's aging and now there's a whole,

136
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.620
there's a community for that for like something old,
overweight,

137
00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:13.550
what would beard it.
But if you showed up for everybody,

138
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.390
show up in your 20s or 30s and you're like,
dude,

139
00:09:17.391 --> 00:09:20.010
you're not working out.
They're going to get,

140
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:25.250
you're going to get crumbs if that's what you meant.
I wish you two are gay guys.

141
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.890
So yeah,
no.
Well,

142
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:32.040
I just got a tattoo on my leg of my area code where I'm at because I'm Mexican

143
00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:36.060
trash dude.
Right.
That's what Latinos do.
They love that.
Put their area code.

144
00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:36.960
So I put it on,

145
00:09:36.961 --> 00:09:41.961
which is six oh seven and of course red band comes up who like is the mayor of

146
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:44.670
like four Chan and reddit.

147
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.350
And he informed me that six oh seven basically means it's a gay term to shoot.

148
00:09:49.351 --> 00:09:50.490
Come in your asshole.

149
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.310
But I'm cool with that too.
You know,

150
00:09:56.311 --> 00:09:59.520
it's like it's my hometown or you like to get weird.
Either way I'm in,

151
00:09:59.521 --> 00:10:00.780
you know really what that means.

152
00:10:00.781 --> 00:10:04.580
That's what he said to me and somebody sent it to me.
I bet red bands,
right?

153
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:07.830
Look it up on like a,
I like urban dictionary.
It's like,

154
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.890
it's like fist pumping cheers or something like that.

155
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.730
Does know all these things though.
But he's,
when he's drunk,

156
00:10:14.731 --> 00:10:19.200
he comes with that devil smirk and you just know he's about to talk some mad

157
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:22.830
shit.
Yeah,
of course.
Um,

158
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.790
so funny.
That's so hilarious.
Yeah.
Again,
this is not sexual.

159
00:10:26.791 --> 00:10:27.750
These are just a bunch of guys.

160
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.760
Just who need a shave on their scrotum and there just happens to be a fuck swing

161
00:10:32.761 --> 00:10:34.830
and guys in harnesses,
and this is a very innocent,

162
00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:39.831
I find that the female equivalent of this is Instagram models who do like humble

163
00:10:40.171 --> 00:10:45.120
brags.
Like they tried to do funny pictures with their bolt holes flapping.

164
00:10:45.121 --> 00:10:48.330
They're like,
oh,
just chilling like a villain and you're like,

165
00:10:48.331 --> 00:10:52.050
you could see into their soul through their asshole and it's just such a weird

166
00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:57.030
humblebrag Instagram girl who shows her tears her ass.
And then she's like,

167
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:01.700
and when people comment and like Nice tits rash,
she's like,
stop objectifying me.

168
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.680
I'm just trying to take a nice picture for me though.

169
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.340
When they call their fans their fam,
it's like,
oh by the way,

170
00:11:08.341 --> 00:11:13.200
your fam is beating off to you just to let you know Uncle Sam's going knuckles

171
00:11:13.201 --> 00:11:17.590
up on it.
Right.
This is saying that it also needs to give a blowjob,

172
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.940
like would you want to suck?
So seven after school.
It's so weird,
right?

173
00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:23.270
It's just my home town.

174
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:28.830
I have to change it to 1607 lifeguard code for a Turd in the pool.

175
00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:34.500
It's magical.
All round,
written upside down.
It spells log.
So,

176
00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:38.163
uh,

177
00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:44.140
<v 8>at this very moment,
Richard is shaving my balls at the end of my Gig,</v>

178
00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:47.230
it's going to make my dick look a bit bigger,
which is always a nice thing.

179
00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:50.420
It's an amazing feeling.
It's just like,
dude,

180
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.380
it's not something that I wouldn't normally,
let's do

181
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.120
<v 7>it.
Smell experience.</v>

182
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.140
And he's quite arousing.

183
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:03.550
<v 0>Yeah,
of course.
It's a little bit arousing.
Here's,
I mean,
hold on,
hold on.</v>

184
00:12:03.551 --> 00:12:05.640
This is that what's coming up here?

185
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:10.060
<v 6>Oh,
I see.
Like a lot of guys shaved their own bowls.
I don't get the shape right.</v>

186
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:12.450
They usually go to high,
stuff like that.

187
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:17.290
Like most things I always fun sloughing off stuff.
Someone else do it for you.

188
00:12:17.291 --> 00:12:21.780
That kind of his dick is like,
it's touching.
Tapping your ass on that.

189
00:12:21.781 --> 00:12:22.614
He's shaving

190
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:25.770
<v 7>like you really don't need to be naked doing this service,</v>

191
00:12:25.771 --> 00:12:27.930
but you've just decided to jump

192
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.480
<v 0>barriers 100% no reason to do this.</v>

193
00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.210
But for the Guy Shaving horse,

194
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.440
<v 6>slept staff saying,
I'll stuff for you.
Then the duty.</v>

195
00:12:35.441 --> 00:12:39.260
So a lot of women go in and get weekly blow drives.

196
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:42.190
I get a few clients that come in for a weekly sprout and shape.
Okay.

197
00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:48.470
<v 0>Here's the part that we knew was coming up because this is always in everything</v>

198
00:12:48.471 --> 00:12:49.304
like this.

199
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.370
<v 7>Usually you find enough straight guys.
I've shaved straight guys balls before.</v>

200
00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.110
Sure,
sure,
sure,
sure,
sure,
sure.

201
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.520
Find that strike guys up that are really comfortable.
They know who that

202
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.220
man.
Everybody's got a work uniform.
Yeah.

203
00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.540
<v 0>Do you think the stripe guys know that they're secretly gay guys?
Yeah.</v>

204
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.900
Because here's,
here's a,
I'll tell you a little secret.

205
00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.920
Those weren't straight guys.
No.
Okay.
There's no such thing as this.

206
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.900
<v 7>I think the kids growing up right now are all going to be bisexual.</v>

207
00:13:16.901 --> 00:13:18.620
They watch so much porn.
Yeah.

208
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.340
The amount of Dick save seen compared to their grandpa.

209
00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:25.130
Like a couple in the army and the fucking showers.
Yeah.
Dick's for debt,

210
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:28.510
like mountains of Dick's.
These get,
these young kids have seen it.

211
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.190
<v 0>They're definitely totally comfortable with it probably.
Yeah,
and it's like,</v>

212
00:13:31.191 --> 00:13:35.430
fuck it.
Hey holes.
Be Weird.
Get a six or seven.
Yay.
Yay.

213
00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
Hey,
what?
Speaking of hair cuts,
um,

214
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:42.680
why don't you tell them about your haircut experience and how I helped you,

215
00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.670
mother,
let's talk about almost divorced to me last week.

216
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:50.520
So,
uh,
oh yeah.
By the way,
so a straight guys,
if you

217
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.950
want to go see the naked Barbara,
I don't know if it's info on where he is,

218
00:13:54.951 --> 00:13:58.280
but um,
either New Zealand it sounds like.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

219
00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:02.660
You should sponsor the podcast.
You know the Nike Baba,

220
00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:08.180
his name is Dick Savvy.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Given name.
Oh,
says Christian is,
he enjoys,

221
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.600
<v 6>I enjoy watching other guys get off on it.</v>

222
00:14:10.601 --> 00:14:15.100
That's where I know I've got a good business.
But as far as the pain,
my fetish,

223
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:20.270
no,
you won't want to pay certain luffing off on shaving aleks and yeah.

224
00:14:20.271 --> 00:14:23.740
Cause you thinking he's getting off just as much as I'm getting off.

225
00:14:23.741 --> 00:14:24.790
Why am I paying for this?

226
00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.830
<v 7>Yeah,
it's,
they're not like where does he live?</v>

227
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:31.800
Is there enough business to keep them open?
Like is like,

228
00:14:31.801 --> 00:14:34.530
is he living with his mom and he's like,
this is my art.

229
00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:37.830
Like I mean in Hollywood there's so many gates.
It's like the,

230
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:42.950
it's the business of gay.
This is Mecca for Bud fucking SCO.

231
00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:47.470
But Sandy Yarrow isn't even close to this.
How are you?

232
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:52.190
<v 0>That's me.
Can I see the back?
Is it still wracked?
No,
it's fixed.</v>

233
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:57.080
<v 4>So I shaved my own head.
And by the way,
a bunch of people were like,</v>

234
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.260
I didn't think you were cheap.
Why are you,
I was like,
I didn't do it to be,

235
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.460
it's not to save money.
It was to save time.
Yeah.
Yeah.

236
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.610
I was always going to go to the gay barber,

237
00:15:06.611 --> 00:15:08.420
but that was always going to get this easy.

238
00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:12.350
You want to fly to New Zealand haircut.
So,
you know,

239
00:15:12.351 --> 00:15:16.130
I used to get it like a little more shaped,
but as I lost hair in the front,

240
00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:19.580
I'm like,
I'll just throw clippers on and have this be done.
You know?

241
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:24.410
So when I was shooting that,
that movie,
the,
uh,
the hair guy,

242
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.440
I told him,
I was like,
I really want to do this.
I have some clippers.

243
00:15:27.441 --> 00:15:30.890
What clippers should I get?
He,
he's like,
these are the best lippers order these.

244
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:33.350
And then he goes,
do you know you'll learn how to do it?

245
00:15:33.351 --> 00:15:37.460
You kind of feel your head and,
and so I ordered them,
I start,

246
00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:41.780
I get the,
the guards and I,
I do my first path,
right?

247
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:45.830
So I do it and then I go into the,
see Christina in the bedroom when I go,

248
00:15:45.831 --> 00:15:49.550
how did I do in the back?
And she's like,
Oh,
you missed like a strip up here.

249
00:15:49.551 --> 00:15:52.220
And I reached and I'm like,
Oh yeah,
I did.
First of all,
you go back in there,

250
00:15:52.221 --> 00:15:55.430
hold on.
Okay,
go back in there,
clean that up,

251
00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:01.220
try to then do my neck and then go back in.
And I'm like,

252
00:16:01.221 --> 00:16:05.180
how's it look if she's like,
looks great.
Then this,

253
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.450
the day that I do that,
I go do two shows at the comedy store.

254
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.030
I go out to dinner the next night.

255
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:16.600
Then the following day I walk into the gym and as I put my stuff in,

256
00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:20.900
like this cubby that my trainers standing,
I hear him go,

257
00:16:20.901 --> 00:16:24.920
what your trainer?
Yeah.
Yeah.
He goes,
the fuck happened to your head,

258
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:26.300
<v 0>Huh?</v>

259
00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.630
<v 4>And I go,
what?
And he goes,
dude.
And he takes a pill.
He takes this picture.</v>

260
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:34.370
He's like,
your neck is jacked,
bro.
And then I sent her this picture.
Go,

261
00:16:34.371 --> 00:16:39.250
what the fuck you told me it looked good.
I liked it.

262
00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.930
<v 0>Thank you.
Unfuckable that's what she doesn't want anybody to look at that.</v>

263
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.800
Beanna may I present my side of the case please?
First of all,

264
00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:51.160
you came into the room.
I was laying on the bed.
It was nighttime.
The,

265
00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:55.270
the room was dimly lit.
And you pointed,
you go,
how does my head look?

266
00:16:55.271 --> 00:16:58.510
And you point at the top of your head.
I never shaved my head.

267
00:16:58.511 --> 00:17:01.480
I don't know that neck lines or I don't fucking know.
I mean,

268
00:17:01.481 --> 00:17:04.360
how about the next few days after this?
I ain't even looking at that stuff.

269
00:17:04.361 --> 00:17:07.660
So I look,
I saw you've got a spot here.
You didn't say,
Hey,
is it,

270
00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.830
you look at the Bot.
I don't know.
I'm,
I don't cut men's hair.
I don't shave guys.

271
00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:13.240
Scrotums how do you fucking know?

272
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:18.300
It looks like a u s jobs chart where it's like up and down,
up,
down,
up,

273
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.700
down.
It's like rock bottom.
Everybody's unemployed.
Yeah,

274
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:21.950
<v 4>you're,</v>

275
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:25.850
the worst part was about this day was that when he's the guy took the picture

276
00:17:25.851 --> 00:17:30.851
when I got to the gym to work out and at the beginning and then the whole time,

277
00:17:31.221 --> 00:17:34.160
you know when someone tells you something like that,
you're like I can't,

278
00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.520
I can't focus on this right now.
Yeah.
He,
he knows.
She's like,

279
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.770
you want to go fix your neck right and you're not in the zone.
You have to go.

280
00:17:39.771 --> 00:17:43.400
You're not in the zone dog.
Not In the zone dog.
And I go,
I know I just fucking,

281
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:45.920
I go,
I can't stop thinking about it.
He was like,
go get your clippers.

282
00:17:45.921 --> 00:17:49.980
I'll fix it for you.
Oh so he's a trainer slash.
Hairstylist as well.

283
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.550
<v 7>Cause he bleach her asshole too.
He bleaches,
he shaves,</v>

284
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.860
he does account and gay Baba.
He does it all

285
00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:00.880
<v 0>you it.
But then I fixed it for you to be fair,</v>

286
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:03.420
you came home and you were so mad at me and I,
I,

287
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:05.510
I didn't know what I'd done wrong.
And,

288
00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:07.900
and that my neck line is a midway through the

289
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.190
<v 7>top of the back of my head.
Let's see it.
Oh yeah,</v>

290
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:15.890
I like that a lot.
It's fine.

291
00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.800
Person the bottom,
we'll meet the top and they'll just be like,

292
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:22.210
I was cursing her name,
weird air horns.

293
00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:25.160
<v 0>He was so mad at me.
But I'm never,
I'm never done that.</v>

294
00:18:25.161 --> 00:18:28.320
So all I'm saying is I can't see Megan Markle doing that to Prince Harry.

295
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.010
Let's talk about it.
How many times have you guys watched the royal wedding?

296
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:37.890
Where did you set your alarm?
You did 4:00 AM I just,

297
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:42.940
you know that I wrote that,
I tweeted that.
Yes.
And since I hashtagged it,
like,

298
00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:45.600
you know,
and,
and that was a popular search term.

299
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:51.180
I mean hundreds of people were like,
me too.
It's so beautiful.
And I was looking,

300
00:18:51.181 --> 00:18:54.210
it was all British people and the women love this shit.
I loved it.

301
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.820
I watched it and not the whole four hours I watched the highlights.

302
00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:01.860
But what I love best about Meghan Markle is that her family's trash.
Like mine.

303
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.850
Yeah.
Like her dad sold photos to the Paparazzi and then was uninvited,

304
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.050
uninvited.

305
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:10.410
And then she's got like this derelict nephew who grows weed for a living who

306
00:19:10.411 --> 00:19:13.890
named a strand of weed after her.
She's like,
thanks asshole.

307
00:19:13.891 --> 00:19:16.770
Like I love that she's in the royal family and she's just,

308
00:19:16.771 --> 00:19:17.790
she's got these horrible

309
00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:22.740
<v 7>glass holes in it.
In her.
I had a family member who is probably one of the top,</v>

310
00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:27.450
uh,
upstate New York meth cookers.
He's doing four to five right now.

311
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.440
The father,
oh no,
four to five.
But he was known as the camera.
So I mean,

312
00:19:31.441 --> 00:19:35.270
we all have weirdness in our family.
This is a close relative.
Oh yeah.

313
00:19:35.271 --> 00:19:38.610
He like tried to rob.
He was my cousin's husband.

314
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:42.930
He tried to rob a Walmart for sudafed.
Oh yeah.
That's where you get it.

315
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.200
That's what you do when you're a chemist.
I get that.
That sheet rock and yeah,

316
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:50.610
I was in upstate New York.
It is shady as shit.
It's not,
you know,

317
00:19:50.611 --> 00:19:53.970
everybody's like,
I'm from the hood.
I'm like,
I'm from upstate New York,
dude.

318
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.480
It is ghetto country,
dude.
It is shady shit.

319
00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.360
That's where the sex Cole is from the big sec sculpted.

320
00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:04.920
They're busing everybody right now.
Albany,
New York rate where I'm from upstate,

321
00:20:04.921 --> 00:20:07.050
anywhere like few hundred miles

322
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.510
<v 0>from the main city always has the sketchiest shit.</v>

323
00:20:09.511 --> 00:20:12.000
Think about what's a couple of hundred miles north of La.

324
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:16.210
That's some sketch boss Chris Field is.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

325
00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:19.350
<v 7>Math is math is time travel.</v>

326
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.270
Like you're in the middle of nowhere and you're like,

327
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.900
I don't want to deal for the next week math and now it's fucking a week's gone

328
00:20:24.901 --> 00:20:25.734
by and it just,

329
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.640
and then you drive the Vegas and there's just this weird out of nowhere.

330
00:20:29.641 --> 00:20:34.290
There's like a,
a trailer in the middle of fucking nowhere and you're like,

331
00:20:34.291 --> 00:20:36.180
you are on the run from some state.

332
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:40.170
There's no reason to be in the middle of the desert right there.
Oh,
by the way,

333
00:20:40.171 --> 00:20:43.290
for stroke gang.
Talk to me.
What is this?

334
00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:47.920
The kids are talking about it.
Yes.
Me pull it up for you.

335
00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.290
Um,
I want to get this right.
I said the best.

336
00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:56.590
<v 4>So
you're going to love this dude.
Um,</v>

337
00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:00.330
let me get this ready for you.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Okay.
Is this the guy?

338
00:21:00.331 --> 00:21:01.230
I think this is the guy.

339
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:07.030
<v 9>If you pet any kind of her tile,
it's order product vomited.
Three,</v>

340
00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.820
forget that bag or forget about Sally's.

341
00:21:09.821 --> 00:21:12.370
Forget about Dick and plants and all that stuff.

342
00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.550
So I don't know if you believe me or not.
Oh God,

343
00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.170
you smoked meth with a small limp Dick at Dan.

344
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:23.410
Get hardly any other way and watch it get harder and harder.
Norris smoke harder.

345
00:21:23.411 --> 00:21:25.770
My Dick get to sound believable.
Yeah.

346
00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.070
<v 7>Yeah.
So this guy,
have you heard of that before Sammy?</v>

347
00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.180
He's a time traveler smoking that.
It's trying to waste a week.
Yeah.

348
00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:35.150
Have you ever smoked meth and a major penis as hard as this guys?

349
00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.730
Once in a while,
like back when you do coke,

350
00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:40.850
there's someone will give you some coke and you're like,
ah,
this isn't coke,

351
00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:45.500
this is math and boom,
we coast by you.
So it's like it does happen.

352
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.950
But Dad doing the mill knowers probably got nothing fucking going on.

353
00:21:48.951 --> 00:21:53.810
And the boy is that the s four stroking?
Well,
well here.
Okay.
No.
So origins.
Yeah.

354
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:58.630
Let me get you the four stroke.
Okay.
It's amazing.
People put this on film.
Yeah.

355
00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.180
It's so amazing.
Like this might come back and fast.
Fuck it.

356
00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:08.070
He's high.
Well,
something actually happened with him.
Uh,

357
00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:13.010
and the fact that he put it on film because he put it on a film and then we put

358
00:22:13.011 --> 00:22:17.210
it on film and then he was like up.
He took it off.
Oh,
did he hit you back on?

359
00:22:17.211 --> 00:22:20.410
Hey Dude,
no,
no.
He just took,
he removed his own.

360
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:23.240
The Mommy's kind of found him and had their way with him.

361
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:24.560
We had that file ripped.

362
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.950
<v 9>You won't believe how good it feels.
Good.
If you're straight,</v>

363
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:33.210
he won't believe how good it bills you're declared become so sensitive that you

364
00:22:33.211 --> 00:22:34.850
don't need lube.
You don't need spirit.

365
00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.570
You're just decay so much going on here and do this.

366
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:44.910
And he would shoot an enormous amount of very thick,
thick,

367
00:22:44.911 --> 00:22:46.340
high white come.

368
00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:51.630
<v 7>Ah,
got it on the brain.
Right.
That's all they think of.</v>

369
00:22:51.631 --> 00:22:55.170
All they care about is coming.
Yeah.
It's just the testosterone,
you guys,

370
00:22:55.171 --> 00:22:57.150
it's all we care about choosing all day.

371
00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.580
<v 4>Pretty nuts.
I mean it is like,</v>

372
00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.400
I think it's different for some people and I think if,

373
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:07.080
I mean it is like a constant thing,
but if you are somebody who,

374
00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:12.360
uh,
also has like,
uh,
you know,
what's it called?

375
00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:15.530
Uh,
um,
drug problems or something and then yeah,

376
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.860
<v 7>it's exacerbated.
Oh yeah.</v>

377
00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:21.540
Did really drug and sex addiction or like tag team champions did.
Yeah,

378
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.400
for sure.
They like to get weird.

379
00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.540
How's your show taking a hit since they took down like the,

380
00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:32.810
the casual encounters on craigslist now you can't go get all those sweet looking

381
00:23:33.631 --> 00:23:37.460
for weirdness.
Oh no worry.
We get the video sent to.
Oh,
good,
good,
good.

382
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:41.690
Well there's plenty of that stuff.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah.
Uh,

383
00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:45.980
so the forest stroke gang is an homage to this clip of this saying that when he

384
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.600
<v 0>smoked mad that he can come and four strokes,
God and also dusting,
right?
I mean,</v>

385
00:23:50.601 --> 00:23:52.340
would you wear or it's a super power.

386
00:23:52.341 --> 00:23:54.560
It could be one of the other could go either way,
but Sammy,

387
00:23:54.561 --> 00:23:57.110
would you wear a shirt?
It's not just him though,

388
00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.570
that that came in forced drugs.

389
00:23:59.571 --> 00:24:02.870
He also introduced this product too.

390
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:08.540
God Damn it.
Why the fuck is this happening to me,
dude?

391
00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:11.850
Your production value is amazing.
If that's the worst thing that happens.

392
00:24:11.851 --> 00:24:12.684
So it's pretty,

393
00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:16.830
<v 9>and believe me,
when he smoked with me,
put it this take,</v>

394
00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.560
I can't believe how big his dick was.

395
00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.470
He checked off and throw out the most common,

396
00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:27.110
every shot is like he's only 49.
And he's fine.
He has no problems.

397
00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:32.240
It gets even harder,
thicker,
and even more coming believes mail

398
00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:36.340
<v 0>that's math just gives you the fuck.
It's right.
You're like,
oh,
you're my brother.</v>

399
00:24:36.341 --> 00:24:37.980
You're gonna stroke it.
Pocket.

400
00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:42.370
Have you ever does your job with your brother and no math?
No.

401
00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:47.410
So the forced drug gang,
Christ from this and then we grow.

402
00:24:47.411 --> 00:24:50.410
We did do the,
um,
the four stroke gang shirt,

403
00:24:50.411 --> 00:24:53.710
which Christina thought we would sell five of.
She's like,

404
00:24:53.711 --> 00:24:56.560
nobody wants a woman's going to wear for stroke gang.

405
00:24:56.561 --> 00:24:59.440
You've already exed out half the audience.
It's sold out.

406
00:24:59.441 --> 00:25:03.550
I had to reorder it immediately.
You are,
you two are the best at t shirt.

407
00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:07.950
I don't unders.
Wow.
You're amazing.
Here's the thing.
Here's another thing.
I don't,

408
00:25:07.951 --> 00:25:12.700
no.
So one of the things that happened is we did a golf inspired for stroke.
Sure.

409
00:25:12.701 --> 00:25:15.770
Cause you stroke cause you don't want to put like Jackie your divine right.

410
00:25:15.771 --> 00:25:20.350
Right,
right.
What about a calm beer rob?
Rob,
does that make sense?

411
00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:24.080
So we put that out there.
You put the golf one out there.
Um,

412
00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:28.000
it went really well but a lot of people were like this should have been an

413
00:25:28.001 --> 00:25:30.850
engine.
Four stroke engines,
motorcycles for stroke.

414
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
So I got went ahead and re ordered also a four stroke engine.

415
00:25:36.491 --> 00:25:39.790
Sure.
For the all the uh,

416
00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:43.570
motorheads there is a four stroke engine on top of that.

417
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.650
I also have a four stroke hat coming.
Oh um,
yeah.

418
00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:50.140
So it's all about getting high and jacking in your car.

419
00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.840
And that's what we're all about.
That,
that's the best part.

420
00:25:52.841 --> 00:25:54.570
You go to grandma's house for Thanksgiving,

421
00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:58.210
you got a four stroke because I've been like,
I'm upstate New York,

422
00:25:58.211 --> 00:25:59.830
we'll go to weddings and Jean shorts.

423
00:25:59.831 --> 00:26:04.360
So I'll wear a four stroke at a fucking holy ceremony.
I'll do it.
I love it.
So,

424
00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:05.830
let's see,
how many girls by,

425
00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:08.960
do you think they go knuckles up when they forced drug?
Yeah,

426
00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.530
that's a little crazy.
I have a joke about that.
Like,
okay,
sorry about that.

427
00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:16.710
Those topics.
Okay.
Put that on there.
Yeah.
Oh,

428
00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:18.430
when we read back the minutes later.

429
00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:26.120
Oh we should corporate.
We should get to this cause is here.
Yes.
Um,

430
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:31.500

432
00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:38.200

And not only that,

433
00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:43.210

434
00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:47.190
Oh,

Yeah.
Or whole man out.
Yeah.

435
00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:50.550
Very similar to this.
What do you hear?

436
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:58.130
A lot of people were debating,
some people still said,
well,

It's a,

437
00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:02.880
it's a whole man out.
You know,
I'm home.
I'm home here now.

438
00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:06.690

439
00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.460

445
00:27:29.281 --> 00:27:34.281
but he's so worked up on home here now cause he gave out his address before and

446
00:27:34.651 --> 00:27:39.130
he's like,
Oh yeah,

Yes.

447
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:43.440

517
00:32:25.801 --> 00:32:29.880
They went a little deeper than just a craigslist creepy fuck.
They go,

518
00:32:29.881 --> 00:32:32.340
what is this person's back story?

519
00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:35.340
What was high school like for this person?

520
00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:37.620
What was their relationship to their father?

521

Did the family like the fucking fuck now thug hard come over and fuck hard.

You know?

523
00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:47.120
I mean it was a different interpretation yet it worked because the energy,

524
00:32:47.121 --> 00:32:51.320
the frenetic energy and the anxiety was there.
I felt it.
I felt it.

525
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:54.380
Couple more females.

528
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:04.850
You might actually send her out first.
Let's get the show stuff.

529
00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:07.453
Go out there.

She took her shirt off.

534
00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:36.260

Everything else,

And here's the deal,

535
00:33:36.261 --> 00:33:40.890
man in jail,
homeless,
want to come move in.

536
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:45.320
Moving to men.
This is really good.
This is Kelsey.

537
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.690
She also committed,
she did a,

538
00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:51.490
I feel like a commitment to a different drug than the words.

539
00:33:51.491 --> 00:33:56.060
It feels more sedated.
Okay.
Eva,
but maybe sativa,

540
00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.530
maybe like a real,
I don't know,
more excessive,
more powerful downer,

541
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:05.680
but the eyes black tar.
Yeah.
I'm like more of a black tar feel.

542
00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:10.100
Yeah.
I feel like the eyes are really selling it for me.

543
00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:12.380
I love your mustache.

544
00:34:12.381 --> 00:34:17.320
Obviously her pacing is very slow shirt off detail also.
Yeah.

545
00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:21.440
You know when you do these auditions and you submit these things,

546
00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:25.510
it's all about details because God's in the details and if you're a black guy

547
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:29.480
likes to fuck and like fuck hard,
you know,
I've got to feel that in your video.

548
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:32.650
Yeah,
that's true.
That's true.
I got to feel it.
I got to feel it.

549
00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:33.880
It's also a brave choice.

550
00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:42.460
What the fuck black guys who lopped off fucking unbelievable.

551
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:48.290
And you want to fuck
and the bow.

552
00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:57.140
You know what I feel like this is like backstage a Larry the cable guy concert.

553
00:34:57.141 --> 00:35:01.460
We're like,
we're like backstage.
He's just a dude.
And then yeah,
the Larry,

554
00:35:01.461 --> 00:35:04.970
the cable guy,
eyes come in and now he's the character.
Well that's what I felt.

555
00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.580
She did something amazing.
She started,

556
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000
she started her clip by saying she's Peyton Lafferty who is another go to from

557
00:35:13.761 --> 00:35:16.790
the show.
Oh sorry.

558
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:22.280
So she did that.
Oh Shit.

559
00:35:22.281 --> 00:35:26.620
And then she went into the time that she actually switched person.
She went,

560
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:30.530
she went from like hi and then she's doing this really well.

561
00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:35.420
I think she's active and,
and you know what I like,
her posture is exactly his,

562
00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:38.500
she even got the bow,
the attention to detail.
Yeah.

563
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.700
I wonder how much she paid for like a lighting crew.
The light,

564
00:35:41.701 --> 00:35:45.480
the scene for her and,
and the lighting went from like well lit to like Kramer.

565
00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:50.460
Yeah.
Very Good Edward.
It's competitive.
Competitive.
It is.

566
00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:53.380
And if you don't put the time and effort in,
you're not going to make the shift.

567
00:35:53.381 --> 00:35:58.150
This is Chris,
this chick's great.
Jail,
homeless,
great.

568
00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:03.150
She's obviously Armenian.
She's a woman with a mustache,
so those are my people.

569
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:07.770
That's my mom's mom.
She's,
she's,
she's very good at mimicking,
I think.

570
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:13.280
Very close.
Very good.
Moving Franco.
Moving to man.

571
00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:18.350
She's got the accent.
Yeah,
piss on me.
Beat me.
Oh Man.

572
00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:23.930
Oh Man.
Out.
Try it out,
man.
Your dawn and try it out.

573
00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:25.050
You want to fucking piss on me.

574
00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:29.990
You've literally gone through more or less female listeners and all my podcasts.

575
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:36.000
Now here's the thing.
As with the Yani,
Laurel,
I'm now,
I'm hearing home man.

576
00:36:36.001 --> 00:36:39.120
Now of course it's like it goes back and forth.
Your brain is primed to,

577
00:36:39.121 --> 00:36:43.170
that's why we just live in a simulation,
man.
Yup.

578
00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:46.110
Black guys who love to fuck and fuck good.

579
00:36:46.111 --> 00:36:49.740
If you're hot black guy and you want to fuck the at two,
three,
nine,
five,

580
00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:54.490
if you want to move,
you've got to fuck me.
I fucked a lot.

581
00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:59.970
He's like the Guy Ritchie version of it,
you know?
Can I tell you something?

582
00:36:59.971 --> 00:37:04.830
All I keep thinking about it is like this video getting out there on its own

583
00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:07.950
with obviously near context and guys watching this being like,

584
00:37:07.951 --> 00:37:10.620
we have got to find this thick,
this Lauren,

585
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:15.270
because this is exactly the video I've wanted to see my whole life.

586
00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:17.880
Like a woman who's like,
guys who want to fuck,

587
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:20.550
I'm down if you want to piss on me.
Oh yeah.

588
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:25.020
And Are you one more magical than British black guys?

589
00:37:25.021 --> 00:37:27.750
Like Guy Ritchie films.
They have all the answers.

590
00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:32.430
Whatever you don't know about life,
they fill it in.
It's so much better.

591
00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:37.410
Me have been a Pelletreau doing a British accent.
Like she's got that refinement.

592
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:40.910
Very clean and crisp.
It's a Shakespeare in love version.

593
00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:45.140
What better way to honor the royal wedding then to push them to get their on by

594
00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:49.620
black guys.
Men from jail,
jail,
jail.

595
00:37:49.621 --> 00:37:51.270
Sounds like a wonderful place where she's from.

596
00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:55.280
Your friend can move into free rent.
You get at least in a cage.

597
00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:58.440
She goes like casual,
piss on me,
beat me.

598
00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:01.590
Have you guys ever been peed on?

599
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:06.850
How would you say great.
Have you gotten,
by the way?
We're talking about,

600
00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:11.670
have you gone to adult con before?
I've gone every time.
Please.

601
00:38:11.671 --> 00:38:16.530
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
I got peed on by Miley Cyrus,
his stunt double.

602
00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:20.590
Of course she did,
but so,
so,
uh,

603
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:25.620
do you remember the British,
the uh,
the uh,
American music awards?

604
00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:30.650
It was many moons ago and Miley Cyrus is dancing on stage and then she runs down

605
00:38:31.081 --> 00:38:36.010
the aisle and then the camera turns and Miley is sitting there in her seat.
Well,

606
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.950
<v 7>that girl who runs down the thing peed on me one time.</v>

607
00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:43.370
We were at the comedy store and seeing you at the store.
Well,
she tried,

608
00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:46.630
it got like this weird like deer hunting fucking thing went on.

609
00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.540
What was she hammered?
She wasn't,
she just somebody,

610
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:52.480
she somehow brought up peeing and she's like,
I'll pee on you.

611
00:38:52.481 --> 00:38:55.270
And then it got really weird and everybody's laying money down.

612
00:38:55.271 --> 00:38:58.060
So then we're all in the back and nothing happened.

613
00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.280
Where were you when you got peed on?

614
00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:03.820
I was in the shower of the green room of the main room.
Okay.

615
00:39:03.821 --> 00:39:07.780
And did you strip down or I just took my shirt off.
And she peed on your chest?

616
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:11.230
No,
she couldn't.
So then she's like,
Oh,
I really want pee on you.
I'm like,

617
00:39:11.231 --> 00:39:13.480
well let's go back to my place.
He could pee on me.

618
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:17.440
So we go back to my place and I,
I,
you know,
I'd take the shop.
She peed on me.

619
00:39:17.441 --> 00:39:18.430
It's wonderful.

620
00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.340
And then I get up and she starts putting on her clothes and I'm like,

621
00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:23.480
what are you doing dude?
Like are you putting it,

622
00:39:23.481 --> 00:39:25.300
why are you putting in your life?
She's like,
we're going to have sex.
I'm like,

623
00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:28.570
I'm not a Porta potty.
You know what I'm saying?
Like I like,
yeah.

624
00:39:28.571 --> 00:39:32.080
So I actually do enjoy it.
Oh,
so and then you,
you told her?
Yes.

625
00:39:32.081 --> 00:39:35.620
And then she's like,
oh,
okay.
I will have sex with you.
And then smooth.
Right.

626
00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.030
Like what did her piece smell?
A lot of showered after.
I'm not a scumbag,

627
00:39:40.031 --> 00:39:43.240
but I did.
I'm not against it.
They,
after she peed on you,

628
00:39:43.241 --> 00:39:48.100
you showered and then you had sex?
No.
Take me,
I'm sorry to ask a lot of details,

629
00:39:48.101 --> 00:39:50.550
but can you take me through,
let's talk about where did you lay that?

630
00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:54.880
Where you lay in your bathtub?
Yes.
Okay.
And then does she squat over you?

631
00:39:55.450 --> 00:40:00.370
Ah,
yes.
Um,
and like facing new,
no.
Sh Ah,
no,

632
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.950
he was an asshole towards my face and like very close or like,

633
00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:10.150
you know,
far up.
I didn't know.
She wasn't like right here.

634
00:40:10.151 --> 00:40:14.080
She's like here like,
you know,
I was in the tub,
there's a tub she's on,

635
00:40:14.081 --> 00:40:17.800
had foot on both sides holding boom.
And then yeah,

636
00:40:17.801 --> 00:40:20.220
Pete and some of that Bennett is she like,
um,

637
00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:23.710
I like it that she laughing door during it and he's just like,
you know,

638
00:40:23.711 --> 00:40:26.470
she's happy.
She,
she achieved something.

639
00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:30.460
Get in the tub naked in the tub.
I W I had my,

640
00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:34.420
I think I was naked actually because I was in the tub.

641
00:40:34.421 --> 00:40:35.720
It was going to get all over the place.

642
00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:38.380
What I thought so did it get in your mouth?

643
00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:41.200
Nose more of my chest,

644
00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:46.510
but I wouldn't be against that cause it didn't smell strong.
No,

645
00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:51.340
no,
it was excellent.
He is.
Yeah.
I mean like peeing on people.

646
00:40:51.341 --> 00:40:55.600
It was like not drinking more.
Who was,
who was like a shower?

647
00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:59.710
Golden.
Yeah.
He's like,
yeah,
dude.

648
00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:03.700
I guess I'm just a Weirdo.
I can see how it's pleasurable.

649
00:41:03.701 --> 00:41:08.110
What about eating poop though?
I don't eat poop.
I don't,
but I love eating,
but,

650
00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:11.020
but I don't like poop.
No.

651
00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:15.150
You made sure the booties clean.
Yeah.
You got to do a quick look.

652
00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:19.730
Just get in there like a champion,
Ui it out for it and then I finger blasts,

653
00:41:19.731 --> 00:41:21.300
which is,
I call it the Avatar.

654
00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:25.570
Remember when they sync up with the a flying animal and the other soul mates.

655
00:41:25.571 --> 00:41:30.150
That's why back in the day,
this is young Tripoli.
Now I just want to sleep.
Yeah.

656
00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:33.920
Have you ever had anyone take a shit on?
You know,
that will never happen.

657
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:38.300
That's just not my thing.
It's to McAfee.
Is that his name?
Yeah.
John McAfee.

658
00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:43.450
Mcafee.
Oh,
he's into that?
Yeah,
it is.
Oh really?
Oh,

659
00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:47.540
it's just not my thing too.
I can't even entertain it.

660
00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:52.640
It's a lot.
Yeah.
Hooping in the mouth.
I don't know how you keep from vomiting.

661
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:57.430
Really.
Oh,
do the smell of like fresh cumin shit.
Oh,
just throw hook.

662
00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:00.380
Get me Outta here.
I was watching,
uh,

663
00:42:00.381 --> 00:42:04.390
I laugh by the way we were talking about women's bathrooms versus meds and she

664
00:42:04.391 --> 00:42:07.010
was saying how like women,
you know,

665
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:10.400
we'll like squeeze their butts on the dumper.

666
00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:15.640
And I was in lax yesterday and I walked in,
it was like,
oh gosh,

667
00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:22.850
and need get almost embarrassed.
Like,
oh so well you're like,
ah,
sorry.
You know,

668
00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.280
it's like a symphony out your asshole.
It really is.

669
00:42:25.281 --> 00:42:29.540
And like those bathrooms are wrecked,
man.
Lax.

670
00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:32.840
I just feel like the women's poop doesn't smell as bad as guys.
That's right.

671
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:37.160
It's a completely,
completely wrong.
It's smells horrendous.
It's the same thing.

672
00:42:37.161 --> 00:42:41.150
It's shit.
Shit is shit.
We eat the same things.
Right.
What do you spray after?

673
00:42:41.151 --> 00:42:43.250
Cause back in the day when I worked at the store,

674
00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:48.400
the best place to meet chicks were sitting next to the women's bathroom and it

675
00:42:49.191 --> 00:42:51.420
came out.
It was never like I was ever like,

676
00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:55.550
it's not that this shit doesn't stick.
We don't Shit at the comedy store.

677
00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.790
Women are more weary of shitting in public is what I'm saying,

678
00:42:58.791 --> 00:43:02.690
that it's the fear of embarrassment and of the smell.
So we'll shit here at home,

679
00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:06.530

I'm definitely less strokes than I used to be.

684
00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:26.360
I just feel like sex is like to stroke.
People talk a big game.

685
00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:30.080
They talk like I'm going to do this,
I'm gonna do this.

686
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:32.960
And then just at the end it's like bump,

Yes,

she really did her own thing.

717
00:45:22.261 --> 00:45:24.420
I always tell people that when it comes to the industry,

718
00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:25.800
they don't know what they want.

719
00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:31.230
These people let you know what they want and therefore you know where you want

720
00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:33.750
to,
what they want.
As as the director,

721
00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:37.440
I would right now be talking to my producers like I really liked what Loren did.

730
00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:12.420
They spend their money,

731

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:40.510
This awesome.
It looks like somewhat of a hostage situation as well.

749
00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:45.460
You know what I could see like Fiona apple doing torture,

750
00:47:45.461 --> 00:47:49.470

You,

751
00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:53.790
bells inside.

752
00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:57.820
What was that band from like the early two thousands they were big and then they

753
00:47:57.821 --> 00:48:01.690
just went away like dido or like this is one of those,

754
00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:03.880
I'm totally break up songs.

755
00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:06.200
<v 4>Um,

She paid attention to the lighting,
the details.</v>

758
00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.020
Imagine if they try it out guy,

759
00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:22.260
how can you get these to him and let him know like he's inspired so much hard.

760
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:26.360
Oh my God,

It's a c that's it.

761
00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:29.940

No,

Oh,

762
00:48:29.941 --> 00:48:34.260
Just took off and then like 20 years later he's just like,
everybody walks him,

Sharmy goes,

766
00:48:43.561 --> 00:48:47.340
I don't give a fuck what you do with the Sharman.
Okay.
You think I give a fuck?

767
00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:51.640
And I'm like,

The time you,

768
00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:54.900

I no longer enjoy any type of self pleasure.

773
00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:12.090
Now that vision of Mr Math and his voice haunts my spank bank.

774
00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:16.050
Never again will I be alone with my thoughts.

814
00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:46.940
we're going to do stand up.
Okay.
And then we're going to do a Q and a at the,
oh,

815
00:51:46.941 --> 00:51:50.250
that's so you're getting double trouble.
Yeah.
You know what?

816
00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:55.250
There's one thing that's so great about when you do a one show night somewhere

817
00:51:55.460 --> 00:52:00.410
where it just breathe easy and people know that like we're going to settle in to

818
00:52:00.411 --> 00:52:03.740
like,
it's just for us,
the one show nights,

819
00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:07.880
the show's been tinfoil hats been killing it lately,
man.
It's been a lot of fun.

820
00:52:07.881 --> 00:52:11.170
I've learned a lot about the world and it's,
I just enjoy it.

821
00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:14.810
<v 2>Good man for you to perfect for it.
Sam Aaa.</v>

822
00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:17.390
Such a fantastic standup comic if you want to see him.

823
00:52:17.391 --> 00:52:20.630
He's also on my show May 31st at the comedy store in the belly room,

824
00:52:20.631 --> 00:52:24.770
the eight o'clock show.
So excited.
I just small show.
I'm running my Netflix set,

825
00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:26.810
uh,
for the Vegas shooting June 4th.

826
00:52:26.811 --> 00:52:29.780
And you're going to get to see Sam Tripoli as well.
So try it out.

827
00:52:29.830 --> 00:52:32.510
And then you did my Dojo room is so much fun.

828
00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:36.950
You gotta do what you do at a few nights a week.
He runs every night,

829
00:52:37.310 --> 00:52:41.000
every night in Los Angeles.
At the Sycamore Tavern in Hollywood.

830
00:52:41.001 --> 00:52:43.230
It's a fantastic comedy show.
Uh,

831
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:47.130
drinks right free parking.
Parking's x,

832
00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:50.420
<v 7>gives work it out.
That's really what I created the room for us.</v>

833
00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:54.930
Just somewhere like you don't have to fall like monsters and you can just try to

834
00:52:54.931 --> 00:52:58.280
work something now.
It's a great room.
And Sam,

835
00:52:58.390 --> 00:53:01.890
he shot his new special yup.
Viper Room.
Editing it right now.

836
00:53:01.891 --> 00:53:03.150
Super excited about it.

837
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:07.320
I'm going to edit it as one piece and then also break it into two pieces.

838
00:53:07.321 --> 00:53:09.330
Like two 40 fives.
Wow.

839
00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:12.660
Look at you with some bonus jokes at the end that I forgot to do that.

840
00:53:12.661 --> 00:53:15.810
I just want to add your shopping at home for it right now a while.

841
00:53:15.811 --> 00:53:17.280
Once it's edited,
all things.

842
00:53:17.281 --> 00:53:19.800
Comedy wants to bring it up so I'm cool wherever it goes.

843
00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:22.260
If it goes somewhere cool or put out myself,

844
00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:25.560
I'm just kind of why I just want to start creating shit.
Throw it out.

845
00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:26.850
You don't care.
That's the way to do it.

846
00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:30.480
People are going to love it when they see I'm a crazy person.
I like just,

847
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:32.160
I like to just do my own thing.
You know,

848
00:53:32.161 --> 00:53:36.220
what I like about Sam is that you really don't give a fuck.

849
00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:37.320
And I feel like,

850
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:41.910
especially in this era of people being censored and afraid to say things,

851
00:53:41.911 --> 00:53:46.170
it's so important to have comedians like you out there.
Uh,
really try.

852
00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:46.771
You know what I'm saying?

853
00:53:46.771 --> 00:53:50.280
Like really keeping it real and being an hardcore guys who want to fucking fuck.

854
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:53.260
Yeah,
I want to fuck,
I want to fuck good,
I want to fuck now.

855
00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:57.220
And I just feel that it's just like,
you know,
my career is what it is.

856
00:53:57.221 --> 00:53:59.770
I don't really care to do the Hollywood thing anymore.
Don't get me wrong.

857
00:53:59.771 --> 00:54:01.050
If they offered it,
I'd probably do it.

858
00:54:01.051 --> 00:54:05.680
But I just feel like we have so many comedians selling each other out and just

859
00:54:05.681 --> 00:54:07.780
let it,
like just joining this mob.

860
00:54:08.050 --> 00:54:13.050
And I just feel like comedians have to be able to fail and say provocative shit

861
00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:19.260
and just go for it and not be like blackball I just don't get this world of like

862
00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:22.960
black balling comics because you didn't like a joke.

863
00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:26.260
And I think we let the meek pick the rules.

864
00:54:26.290 --> 00:54:28.660
I feel like political correctness is like letting the,

865
00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:31.770
the fat kid who gets picked last and kickball,
uh,

866
00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:34.490
make the rules of the playground.
It makes no sense to me.
Yeah.

867
00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:39.130
I feel like the joke,
wait,
leave,
do whatever you want.
But she like,
Dude,

868
00:54:39.131 --> 00:54:43.000
stop telling people what they can.
And especially comics who are like,
oh,

869
00:54:43.001 --> 00:54:47.080
do Dutch is,
you shouldn't say that.
Why would you ever want to limit yourself?

870
00:54:47.590 --> 00:54:50.540
Why?
I don't get it.
No,
it's ridiculous.
No,
I know.
And it's,

871
00:54:50.590 --> 00:54:55.060
it is heartbreaking when it's comedians that are policing.
What are you do?

872
00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:59.560
Is these Beta cook,
these Beta Cox to the Beta male,

873
00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:00.670
the Beta Cox,

874
00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:05.140
what they're trying to do is outrage themselves through their dreams.

875
00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:06.550
That's really what they're trying to do.

876
00:55:06.730 --> 00:55:10.030
They're trying to get rid of everybody that they're threatened by so they can

877
00:55:10.031 --> 00:55:13.420
just walk right into their dreams.
Don't realize that everybody's got dreams.

878
00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:14.860
Yeah.
And you won't make your dreams.

879
00:55:14.861 --> 00:55:16.570
You've got to take someone else's dreams and like,

880
00:55:16.571 --> 00:55:20.350
it's not going to be easy like that.
Those are some wise words from Sam Aaa.

881
00:55:20.351 --> 00:55:24.760
Right.
Very true.
A lot of people are,
um,
they rail against people.

882
00:55:24.761 --> 00:55:28.630
They feel threatened by it.
Absolutely.
This business for sure,
the powerful,

883
00:55:28.631 --> 00:55:30.670
the winners and they want to drag down.

884
00:55:30.850 --> 00:55:34.300
My French is getting in trouble for this fucking tweet and it's just like the,

885
00:55:34.450 --> 00:55:37.270
it's like you said that I could sing a white males are the new n word.

886
00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:41.470
It's a bad joke.
It's a,
it's not a good joke,
but he's like,

887
00:55:41.530 --> 00:55:44.410
he's got black balled from this club and guess who's yelling at him?

888
00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:46.900
White Beta Cox.
That's his genre.

889
00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:51.040
It's not black guys or black women going crazy.
Beta Cox.

890
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:55.120
That's the next shirt.
Tom Beta Cox.
I love Beta cock.
That's great.

891
00:55:55.150 --> 00:55:58.840
That's gotta be your next shirt.
Sam.
You should,
I'm going to go,
I mean,
just go,

892
00:55:58.841 --> 00:56:02.590
oh,
I'm so tired of it.
Of these meat.
And then you got,
you know,

893
00:56:02.591 --> 00:56:06.820
all these male feminists who in Hollywood we find out are all the ones doing all

894
00:56:06.821 --> 00:56:10.950
the raping.
Yeah.
Right?
Yes.
Yes.
It's not the knuckle draggers.
Yeah.
No,

895
00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:15.350
not the saddle ranch bartenders.
They're doing all this shit.
That's right.
Yeah.

896
00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:18.730
The ones with the big mouth piece that they're so fucking look at Cosby telling

897
00:56:18.731 --> 00:56:20.860
everybody how to live.
What a scummy dad.

898
00:56:20.861 --> 00:56:23.160
He's the most evil of the fucking all of them.
Yeah.

899
00:56:23.161 --> 00:56:26.530
I know Matt Lauer that fucking Homo too.
I mean come on,

900
00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:29.920
but he's hit like Matt Lauer is looking to make a comeback.

901
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:31.570
Comeback from a fucking,

902
00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:36.780
basically a rape button like hit a rape button in is nobody wants a now back

903
00:56:37.361 --> 00:56:39.950
from any of those.
No.
Nobody gives a,

904
00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:43.660
I don't want to and see Chris to that fucking ass kisser.
Well,
he didn't get,

905
00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:46.390
he didn't get checked at all.
No,
none.
You know why?

906
00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:50.230
Because the me too movement ended up taking out their own people.

907
00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:51.183
Do you know what I'm saying?

908
00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:55.300
They thought it was going to lead to like taking out all these politicians and

909
00:56:55.301 --> 00:56:59.020
it just ended up taking out everybody at the Golden Globes.
Yeah.
They're like,

910
00:56:59.021 --> 00:57:03.290
whoa.
Then it just started ruining brands,
so they're like,
okay,
we got it.
Jay,

911
00:57:03.310 --> 00:57:06.140
just stop.
Nobody's getting harassed anymore.
No,
no.

912
00:57:06.570 --> 00:57:10.470
<v 4>By the way.
I think that that tweet though that,
that Josh then,
yeah,</v>

913
00:57:10.471 --> 00:57:12.570
it was really just,
it was just,
um,

914
00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:17.040
I think he was trying to make a point that he didn't word correctly at all.

915
00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:20.920
Right.
And that,
that's really,
I mean,
that's just why people flip.

916
00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:24.880
<v 7>Well,
we got to be able to,
you know,
you gotta be able to fail and,</v>

917
00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:29.600
and you don't want to just like this notion that he's like trying to bring back

918
00:57:29.601 --> 00:57:34.601
like Alabama and the 1950s it's just ridiculous and it's just white people going

919
00:57:36.381 --> 00:57:38.390
crazy on other white people.

920
00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:42.590
Remember that woman that sent a tweet as she was flying to Africa,
she was like,

921
00:57:42.591 --> 00:57:47.080
fine,
Africa,
hope I don't get aids.
Lol.
And by the time she had landed,
yeah,

922
00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:51.230
she had been fired from her job,
Twitter blown her up and she like,

923
00:57:51.231 --> 00:57:55.550
her life was ruined in a matter of hours from like a dumb joke that she kind of

924
00:57:55.551 --> 00:57:59.180
thought like,
hey,
it's off color.
It's not great.
It's just a thought.

925
00:57:59.181 --> 00:58:03.170
Twitter supposed to be like math throw away.
Yeah.
And her life is ruined.

926
00:58:03.330 --> 00:58:07.280
It doesn't work like that anymore.
No,
it's amazing cement.
He moved.
Yeah.

927
00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:09.960
Thank you.
Um,
you know,

928
00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:14.270
that's the other thing about things written that stay there cause you can read

929
00:58:14.271 --> 00:58:18.530
it over and you oh yeah,
they fall tweets from him from 2008.
Yeah.

930
00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:23.660
From fruit for Josh Denny.
They went back to 2008.
Here's the thing,
man.

931
00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:28.700
Entertainers,
they're crazy people.
Yeah.
And they like crazy weird shit.

932
00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:32.210
And if you,
if you make it so we can't be crazy weird,

933
00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:34.580
you're just going to get liars.
Yeah.

934
00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:36.770
And that's the whole point of comedy is like,

935
00:58:36.771 --> 00:58:39.380
to be as honest as you can on stage,

936
00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:42.320
but when you pull up old tweets from any comic,

937
00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:46.910
you're going to find a wasteland because that's how jokes are written.

938
00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:50.630
You write the thing normally it's not publicly.
And then if,
you know,

939
00:58:50.631 --> 00:58:53.760
if you go through it,
most comedians joke books,
you'd be like,
oh my God.
Yeah.

940
00:58:53.810 --> 00:58:56.420
Yeah.
Because it takes time to work out swings and you're like,

941
00:58:56.421 --> 00:58:57.710
I missed the mark on this.

942
00:58:58.070 --> 00:59:01.670
This is horribly offensive because really like great jokes are,
are

943
00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:06.370
<v 4>usually like on the line.
It's like you find the line and you dance on the line.</v>

944
00:59:06.730 --> 00:59:11.530
If you don't get to do that,
you,
you know,
then you just,
you just never,

945
00:59:11.531 --> 00:59:15.220
right.
What ends up happening is you go over the line a lot when you're trying to

946
00:59:15.221 --> 00:59:18.580
figure something out,
right.
And then you go,
that's too much.

947
00:59:18.850 --> 00:59:21.040
So people don't laugh and you have to pull,

948
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:26.180
<v 7>but you have to be able to try to figure out the line to be able to fail.</v>

949
00:59:26.181 --> 00:59:26.780
And you're like,

950
00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:31.780
you can't tell me to celebrate our diversity and then tell me I can't comment on

951
00:59:32.661 --> 00:59:33.950
it.
You know what I'm saying?

952
00:59:33.951 --> 00:59:38.090
It's like Dave Chappelle is one of the funniest dudes ever.
The first 30 minutes.

953
00:59:38.091 --> 00:59:42.200
I like the first 50 minutes of one this special on Netflix.
All rape jokes.
Yeah,

954
00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:44.900
but where's the outrage on that?
And I love Dave Chappelle.

955
00:59:44.970 --> 00:59:46.440
I don't know why you got it.
Yeah,

956
00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:50.720
but it wasn't like the fucking murder you've seen people go after and then their

957
00:59:50.721 --> 00:59:54.710
whole thing with the Donald Glover video where he's like shooting people and

958
00:59:54.711 --> 00:59:58.190
like white people were loved telling everybody what that video was about.

959
00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:02.150
But two weeks later that Jay feely takes a picture of his daughter going to the

960
01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:06.800
prom with a gun and everybody loses their skull.
And it's just like,

961
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:08.570
what are you doing man?

962
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:13.690
You make it really hard for when real shit hits the fan to anybody.

963
01:00:13.761 --> 01:00:14.594
Give a shit.

964
01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:15.453
<v 4>Well,
the,
the,
the,</v>

965
01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:19.780
what part of what's going on is that everybody has a voice now.

966
01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:23.500
That's what social media has allowed.
It's given everybody a platform.

967
01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:27.280
So it makes people feel powerful.

968
01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:32.290
They get to express that rage and when a lot of them get together,
you know,

969
01:00:32.350 --> 01:00:33.880
it seems like a movement.
Yeah,

970
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:34.760
<v 2>totally.</v>

971
01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:38.240
But it only matters if they can affect the money behind whatever's happened.

972
01:00:38.241 --> 01:00:41.570
That's true.
So if they can rally your employer,
the General Electric,

973
01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:44.630
whatever is sponsoring this thing or that,
then it matters.

974
01:00:44.631 --> 01:00:48.050
It doesn't fucking matter unless it's going to affect the revenue stream tied to

975
01:00:48.051 --> 01:00:52.580
it.
It's always money.
Yeah.
I don't like,
I don't like when anybody from it,

976
01:00:52.581 --> 01:00:53.870
I'm saying any,

977
01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:59.060
<v 4>um,
side of the aisle,
any ideology,
uh,</v>

978
01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.820
gets their,
um,

979
01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:05.880
ability to work destroyed from their jokes or,

980
01:01:06.341 --> 01:01:07.141
you know what I mean?
Like when,

981
01:01:07.141 --> 01:01:11.860
when when somebody makes a a joke and then people are like start attacking.

982
01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:15.610
<v 7>Yeah,
their ability to make a loop.
It's like what is the point of that?
Yeah,</v>

983
01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:16.130
I think that's right.

984
01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:20.280
I think that's a very place to anger and it's just like what you're trying to do

985
01:01:20.281 --> 01:01:25.110
is make the Batman go away and that's not life.
That's just not life.

986
01:01:25.830 --> 01:01:26.510
Now

987
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:29.990
<v 2>argue that that's a problem with the me too movement is that the bad men just</v>

988
01:01:29.991 --> 01:01:32.150
don't go away.
Sweeties it doesn't just go away.

989
01:01:32.151 --> 01:01:34.820
So we need to have a discussion about the gray areas,

990
01:01:34.821 --> 01:01:37.700
not just the black and the why.
You can't just Shawn,
right?

991
01:01:37.701 --> 01:01:41.420
We window throw him in a fire pit and blow up all the rapists and the
pedophiles.

992
01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.910
They're still gonna fucking exist.
So what do we do now?

993
01:01:44.610 --> 01:01:45.510
<v 7>There is a,</v>

994
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:50.620
there is something about Hollywood as no different than Washington DC and,

995
01:01:50.650 --> 01:01:54.180
and Wall Street.
And you know,
if you're lucky to make it through a medium,

996
01:01:54.181 --> 01:01:58.950
like you guys were able to create this amazing medium of this podcast which took

997
01:01:58.951 --> 01:02:03.420
you to the certain levels that you didn't necessarily have to go through that,

998
01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:06.300
you know,
auditioning all the shit to get through.

999
01:02:06.301 --> 01:02:11.280
That almost takes a psychopath level of dedication.
There's craziness.

1000
01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:14.170
Yeah.
So when you get there,
you are a cycle path.

1001
01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:18.870
It is no different than Woelfel Wall Street shit.
True.
Like the,

1002
01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:20.010
you meet the high thigh

1003
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:24.690
<v 0>bay,
they just,
they're just crazy piece sheer force of will.
I mean you,
yeah,</v>

1004
01:02:24.691 --> 01:02:25.320
of course.

1005
01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:28.530
So then they get there in a course they're going to want to scorch the earth.

1006
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:31.740
Right.
And a lot of these guys like couldn't get any,

1007
01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:34.980
couldn't get laid in high school.
So everything I learned about women,

1008
01:02:34.981 --> 01:02:38.040
they learned by watching Japanese anime porn.
Right?

1009
01:02:38.041 --> 01:02:42.420
So they think girls like octopus tentacles all in fucking places and it's just

1010
01:02:42.421 --> 01:02:46.920
like no wonder they're psychopaths.
Yeah.
All right,

1011
01:02:46.921 --> 01:02:50.970
let's go to the next time.
Sammy.
Here's what we're going to now.

1012
01:02:50.971 --> 01:02:54.870
There's no audio cause this is from a security camera.
That's where this lady is,

1013
01:02:54.871 --> 01:02:58.970
that I'm a crazy person.
You're the best guest ever.
Look,

1014
01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:04.500
this woman is really animated yelling at the employees in Canada,

1015
01:03:04.501 --> 01:03:07.380
right?
Yeah.
At Tim Horton's.
That's like their Dunkin donuts.
Right?

1016
01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:12.000
And she's yelling at him,
yelling,
yelling,
yelling.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1017
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:17.310
Don't do it.
Don't do it.
Don't do it.
Don't do it.
Oh my God,
wait,
wait,

1018
01:03:17.311 --> 01:03:21.150
wait this way of what you're seeing.
So,
so yeah,
we,
for people listening,

1019
01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:24.360
this lady was extremely,
extremely animated,

1020
01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:29.520
clearly yelling at the man behind the counter at this Tim Horton's.
Okay.

1021
01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:33.690
She,
um,
she then runs over,
or excuse me,

1022
01:03:33.691 --> 01:03:38.670
walks over to the Napkin dispenser,
Grabs Napkins,
keeps yelling at him.

1023
01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:43.050
You can basically put together that he is,
he's very calmly and politely saying,

1024
01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:47.490
he's Canadian.
Yes.
He's very Canadian.
Like saying you have to leave.

1025
01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:49.200
She keeps yelling.

1026
01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:54.030
Takes the a sweater that is wrapped around her waist,
off,

1027
01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:55.800
drops her pants,

1028
01:03:55.950 --> 01:04:00.820
leans against the wall and takes a big shit like,
uh,

1029
01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:05.170
my dad type shit.
Like,
and by the way,
Christina,
you're totally right.

1030
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:09.690
Women dropped the hot deuce too.
I mean,
it's like,

1031
01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:12.300
it's hail just came out of her that,
you know,

1032
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:16.620
how you get sometimes juiced up and the adrenaline rush and then like you have

1033
01:04:16.621 --> 01:04:21.360
to irritate,
like post dump comedy chats.
Oh yeah.
Was comedy dumps this thing?

1034
01:04:21.361 --> 01:04:22.410
She had one on deck.

1035
01:04:22.411 --> 01:04:25.650
We have to surmise that what's happening is that she probably asked to use the

1036
01:04:25.651 --> 01:04:28.890
restroom,
right as they say as they say,

1037
01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:33.930
washroom to wash clothes and uh,
in,
in Canada,
uh,
customers only probably,

1038
01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:37.590
I assume when I saw it the first time.
Uh,
but then again,

1039
01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.290
the fact that it's Canada makes me think differently.
I don't know.

1040
01:04:40.291 --> 01:04:43.200
I just felt like,
well,
it depends on where you are.

1041
01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:45.480
The big problem in Hollywood is that nobody,

1042
01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:48.810
they really don't like using public bathrooms because people go in there and do

1043
01:04:48.811 --> 01:04:51.870
drugs and then they don't open the door for fucking ever.
Yeah.

1044
01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:55.980
So that's why they like Starbucks forever.
I remember being,
by the way,

1045
01:04:56.420 --> 01:05:01.410
a new comic,
uh,
Sam triple,
he got me into it and uh,
you know,
trying to,

1046
01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:05.490
trying to work out bits and one of my like old school bits,
they never went.

1047
01:05:05.491 --> 01:05:05.701
You know,

1048
01:05:05.701 --> 01:05:09.750
one of those you kind of throw out there was about trying to use a public

1049
01:05:09.751 --> 01:05:13.980
restroom in Hollywood.
It's so hard and also it feels inhumane,
right?

1050
01:05:13.981 --> 01:05:15.810
That you can go like,
Hey,
I need to,

1051
01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:19.420
I'm a human being and I need to pee right now.
And they're like,

1052
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:22.030
you can go somewhere else.
You can't go here.

1053
01:05:22.070 --> 01:05:26.360
<v 7>Not here.
Nope.
Nope,
no public bathrooms.
Uh,
your,
your place of cells,
uh,</v>

1054
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:27.700
liquor,
like,
ah,

1055
01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:30.740
<v 0>Glick our coffee.
This is,
wait,</v>

1056
01:05:30.741 --> 01:05:35.660
this is United States of America and I,
I can't go pee right now.
Drop a deuce.

1057
01:05:35.661 --> 01:05:39.740
Yeah,
I have to go.
And they're like,
well,
it's not for you.
It's,
yeah,

1058
01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:43.250
it's really crazy that you built a narrative like that.

1059
01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:46.550
I just thought she was fired up about something else.
She's a crazy person.

1060
01:05:46.551 --> 01:05:47.300
You might be right.

1061
01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:51.920
You might hear this was a math training and this was her way of retaliating.

1062
01:05:51.921 --> 01:05:56.120
And being like,
fuck you dude.
I want Sammy to take a call from here,

1063
01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:59.960
so I'm going to start playing clip number two of this,
which picks up right here.

1064
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:02.930
You go ahead and describe what you see.
Okay,
here we go.

1065
01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:09.560
<v 7>So,
so then she,
oh my God,
she,
she zoom monkeys it,</v>

1066
01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:14.240
she grabbed up.
By the way,
the whole poop poop is gone.

1067
01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:17.090
I just realized that there's no poop left on that floor.

1068
01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:21.340
She literally cleaned it up for him.
She grabbed it and that poop state heart,

1069
01:06:21.730 --> 01:06:24.410
which made it hard and quick,
which makes me think hi.

1070
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:26.210
It's some oexman shit going on.

1071
01:06:26.211 --> 01:06:31.211
Like her super powers that she drops deuces and places and she uses as a weapon.

1072
01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:33.710
She dropped it.
There's no poop on the floor.

1073
01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:37.520
Which this guy who's drinking his coffee,
he's like,
thank God,
right?
Yeah,

1074
01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:39.800
he sits there and wouldn't you get up?

1075
01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.690
I don't think he knows what's going on because of that wall.

1076
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:45.110
He knows there's some action going on.
But Sandy,

1077
01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:48.080
she picked up her shit and it's gone.

1078
01:06:48.350 --> 01:06:51.770
She threw it at the guy like a boomerang style.

1079
01:06:51.830 --> 01:06:56.720
Then she wiped her ass and through that paper at the guy too.
Man,

1080
01:06:56.750 --> 01:07:01.640
she just really hates this coffee.
That's what this got to be.

1081
01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:04.370
She wants Starbucks is the only got Tim Horton's.

1082
01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:09.310
<v 0>There was audio.
If anybody has the audio file,
please send it in.</v>

1083
01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:11.840
<v 7>I would just love to hear that poop hit again.</v>

1084
01:07:13.790 --> 01:07:17.030
She got some solid lows.
I've dude,
I was blown away.

1085
01:07:17.090 --> 01:07:20.930
That whole poop state together.
It dead.
It wasn't like a five perfect five.

1086
01:07:21.050 --> 01:07:23.330
Does that mean she's healthy if your pool,

1087
01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:26.210
so this is obviously not drug addict.

1088
01:07:26.450 --> 01:07:31.280
This might be like a crossfit lady who just wanted to drop a deuce and they're

1089
01:07:31.281 --> 01:07:35.300
like,
oh sorry.
It's for customers only.
She's like,
Oh really?
Boom,

1090
01:07:35.330 --> 01:07:39.830
eat my fucking whey protein.
Check this out.
I just pulled this up.

1091
01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:40.590
Oh,

1092
01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:43.830
<v 0>audio.
No.
What she has on,</v>

1093
01:07:43.831 --> 01:07:46.950
first of all she had was on athletic pants like PyLadies pants and then the

1094
01:07:46.951 --> 01:07:47.260
thing,

1095
01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:50.730
I think she's like a mom who came from [inaudible] telling me what it says.

1096
01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:51.361
Angry.
It says,

1097
01:07:51.361 --> 01:07:55.650
we finally know why the angry Tim Horton's Pooper pooped for the love of God.

1098
01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:57.630
Just let people use your bathroom.

1099
01:07:59.970 --> 01:08:03.870
In recent days.
This has become the deep in the bowels of a mystery.

1100
01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:06.780
Why does the woman take of Dublin and British Columbia?
Tim Horton's,

1101
01:08:06.781 --> 01:08:08.070
if you haven't heard about this,

1102
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:14.560
<v 7>uh,
this is my only question.
Is,
is how,
how soon too.
She's headlining Improv.</v>

1103
01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:20.600
<v 4>Um,
she then grab Napkins.
Yes.
Picked up her log.
Here's,
we have the answer.</v>

1104
01:08:20.601 --> 01:08:24.380
It turns out the Timmies employees wouldn't let her use the bathroom and she

1105
01:08:24.381 --> 01:08:24.711
really,

1106
01:08:24.711 --> 01:08:28.400
really had to go fucking it mean to Morton's restroom policy is that anyone can

1107
01:08:28.401 --> 01:08:29.840
use it.
You don't have to be a customer,

1108
01:08:30.170 --> 01:08:33.830
but that in some franchises employees have to give you a keys or buzz you into

1109
01:08:33.831 --> 01:08:36.410
the bathroom at their discretion.
On Thursday,

1110
01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:39.200
Tim Horton's responded to the video.
The statement,

1111
01:08:39.201 --> 01:08:40.760
the fast food chain said they didn't let it use me.

1112
01:08:40.761 --> 01:08:44.690
Use the bathroom because of past behavior and past behavior,

1113
01:08:45.230 --> 01:08:47.540
out of concern for the immediate say to team members and guests in the

1114
01:08:47.541 --> 01:08:51.740
restaurant.
We are deeply concerned by this video,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1115
01:08:51.741 --> 01:08:55.280
And in limited cases we restrict a bathroom policies.

1116
01:08:55.850 --> 01:08:59.210
So she had gone in there and made a fool of herself.
Excuse me before.

1117
01:08:59.211 --> 01:09:02.600
Is that what I mean?
That's what that implies.
A police picked her up.

1118
01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:04.790
She was eventually released.
She's coming to,

1119
01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:09.590
she's going to make a court appearance coming up and she'll be headlining.
Yuck.

1120
01:09:09.591 --> 01:09:10.270
Yuck.

1121
01:09:10.270 --> 01:09:14.410
<v 0>In Calgary.
She was that,
what was the other public defecation.
Wait a minute.</v>

1122
01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:19.030
This is,
or this is a open defecation open up.
It is open application.
Absolutely.

1123
01:09:19.031 --> 01:09:23.080
Yeah.
What was the name of that?
Um,
there's Yaki ox and there's house of comedy.

1124
01:09:23.081 --> 01:09:24.760
Yeah,
she,
right,
right.
No,
there's a

1125
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:29.310
<v 4>comedy.
What is the one in Edmonton?
Fuck,</v>

1126
01:09:29.311 --> 01:09:31.910
I can't believe I can't remember the name.
I love the club dude.
I do.

1127
01:09:31.911 --> 01:09:35.810
I shot a special there.
Um,
I don't know.

1128
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:40.430
<v 0>Comedy fucking comedy,
comedy,
comedy committee.
Gambit.
I was told the guy,
oh,</v>

1129
01:09:40.431 --> 01:09:43.460
runs Yuk.
Yuks hates female comics.
That's why I never played there.

1130
01:09:43.850 --> 01:09:48.580
Blows my mind that people do this.
I was told that like a decade ago.
Like,
no,

1131
01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:51.170
he just hates females and like believable.
Yes.

1132
01:09:51.171 --> 01:09:55.970
I won't be doing Canada for so many funny females out there and now it's

1133
01:09:55.971 --> 01:10:00.480
pathetic.
Anyway,
it really is a lot.
Um,
dental update,
man.
Oh,
you're totally right.

1134
01:10:00.481 --> 01:10:02.720
But see these teeth,
let's see,
let's see.

1135
01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:15.070
<v 4>Here is my dental update.
Sammi I'm a big snorer.
Um,</v>

1136
01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:18.070
when I started dating Christina,

1137
01:10:18.071 --> 01:10:21.610
I wasn't snoring and then I got real fat and I started snoring a lot.

1138
01:10:21.611 --> 01:10:26.560
That's men do that.
And one day she played me a recording of my snoring.

1139
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:30.760
Oh really?
This is when we were engaged and I swear to you,

1140
01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:32.200
it was like somebody,

1141
01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:37.150
it was like somebody playing a video of you drunk and they're going,

1142
01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:39.400
this is what you're like when you're drinking.
You're like,
oh my God,

1143
01:10:39.401 --> 01:10:40.450
I have to quit drinking today.

1144
01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:45.550
It was like that where I was so ashamed that I ordered a,

1145
01:10:45.551 --> 01:10:49.720
uh,
a snore guard,
like an online one that night.

1146
01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:55.360
Then I went to the dentist a few months later and I had like a,
a real deal one,

1147
01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:57.610
well,
they're made a plastic,

1148
01:10:57.611 --> 01:11:02.530
obviously their mouth guards over time they start to change color and it starts

1149
01:11:02.531 --> 01:11:03.520
to look like you.

1150
01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:07.870
Keep your snore guard in a trash bag and then you pull it out when you want to

1151
01:11:07.871 --> 01:11:08.704
sleep.

1152
01:11:08.770 --> 01:11:12.850
So mine got to the point where it's pretty discolored now and it looks gross two

1153
01:11:12.851 --> 01:11:15.840
years though.
Yeah,
it's a few years old and I asked that that he was like,

1154
01:11:16.530 --> 01:11:18.690
he said,
it's totally normal.
He goes,
you know,
they look,

1155
01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.670
retainers get scummy too after awhile.

1156
01:11:21.090 --> 01:11:25.650
So I just have my new one delivered yesterday.
How was I last night?
Not a peep.

1157
01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:26.820
Okay.
Yeah.

1158
01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:30.600
I called d four station where it sounds like you're just cutting trees down.

1159
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:34.790
That's me,
my girlfriend.
Go back and forth.
Do you wear a guard?
Nothing,
dude.

1160
01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:38.310
You know,
here's,
here's the thing.
You think when you get it,

1161
01:11:38.311 --> 01:11:41.780
like when I first ordered the one over the,
yeah,

1162
01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:45.780
over the internet or whatever online,
you're like,

1163
01:11:45.781 --> 01:11:50.781
I'm just doing this to save her the burden of having to let her sleep once in a

1164
01:11:51.881 --> 01:11:56.430
while.
That's the only reason I would do.
And it's saying for love,

1165
01:11:56.431 --> 01:11:59.700
what happens is you don't realize that snoring,

1166
01:12:00.090 --> 01:12:04.560
when you snore horrifically,
you're having a lower quality sleep.

1167
01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:09.270
So when you wear this thing,
not only is it quieter for you,

1168
01:12:09.570 --> 01:12:13.980
your getting better sleep,
you start to feel more refreshed.
Yeah,

1169
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:17.380
you should really get one.
I'm not against it.
I mean it's,
you know,

1170
01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:22.080
you know what the principal is of a,
so if you lay on your back right now,

1171
01:12:22.970 --> 01:12:26.970
I pretend you're asleep.
That's exactly right.
See how your lower jaw dropped?

1172
01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:30.720
Yeah.
That's what causes a lot of people snoring.
The jaw drops,

1173
01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:31.980
your tongue sits back,

1174
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:36.300
your throat meat starts to go in on your air valve.

1175
01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:40.230
These guards just keep your lower jaw up.

1176
01:12:41.010 --> 01:12:45.870
So when you're totally passed out like this,
your jaw stays up.
Wow.

1177
01:12:45.930 --> 01:12:47.250
Air Passage stays open.

1178
01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:51.600
Did you sleep so much better just to keep that quality sleep?
Yeah.

1179
01:12:51.710 --> 01:12:56.610
Will you try it?
I will.
I think you'll be much happier.
Where do I get it?
Well,

1180
01:12:56.670 --> 01:13:00.720
I mean,
I went,
I did mine by just going to the dentist and just telling them,
hey,

1181
01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:05.750
I want this done and they take a mold of your top and bottom teeth and then I'm

1182
01:13:06.051 --> 01:13:08.760
going to go get a physical done and I'll get that done.
Dude.

1183
01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:12.420
Tell me how much better you're sleeping.
I will.
I will report back.

1184
01:13:12.450 --> 01:13:15.150
You'll feel like I'm going to try it and you'll get my girlfriend wind throw one

1185
01:13:15.151 --> 01:13:18.990
in her mouth.
Yeah.
Throwing my dog.
My dog snores.
What kind of dog is it?

1186
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:23.280
It's a Mutt.
It's a mix.
It's a flat face.
Like these guys.
No,
no,
no.

1187
01:13:23.281 --> 01:13:27.390
She's a half percent.
She's half percent g half Thai ridgeback.

1188
01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:31.550
The girl here,
Betsy,
she snores like a 300 pound men.
Yeah.

1189
01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:34.140
She's just like cranking it out.
Oh yeah.

1190
01:13:35.610 --> 01:13:38.730
And then it sounds like chains house,
right?
Yeah.
Cause it'll be like,

1191
01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:42.630
and then she like catch herself and I'm like fuck,

1192
01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:47.820
I want to throw her in another room.
She sleep on your beds.

1193
01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:52.530
They've slept on our beds for years during the pregnancy.

1194
01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:56.970
She's much more sensitive to,
you know,
everything.

1195
01:13:57.570 --> 01:14:01.380
So we have crates in the room and we were putting them in the crates.

1196
01:14:01.381 --> 01:14:06.090
My dog sleeps on our bed and she sleeps perpendicular and we work around her.

1197
01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:10.560
Oh yeah.
I'd pay for fucking everything and I've got to work around this dog.

1198
01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:12.340
Oh yeah,
no,
no.
These,
I mean sometimes

1199
01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:14.110
<v 7>when they sleep on the bed,
you know,</v>

1200
01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:17.350
they'll take turns going between like lane between her legs and then come over,

1201
01:14:17.351 --> 01:14:20.800
lay between my legs,
lay next to me.
And you're always like,
yeah,

1202
01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:25.450
there's such adorable,
there's just snoring right over here.
I love dogs.
Yeah,

1203
01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:29.460
the best man.
I'm a big dog person.
Um,

1204
01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:35.020
so tell me how,
tell me the tin foil hat show,

1205
01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:36.280
how long have you been going down on it?

1206
01:14:36.281 --> 01:14:40.180
Cause I'm a little over a year and it's going strong student.
Great man.
You know,

1207
01:14:40.181 --> 01:14:43.930
it's getting hitting marks,
it's growing every day and it's just fun.

1208
01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:48.850
I'm not just like,
and it lets you be crazy.
I just enjoy hearing it all.

1209
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:53.590
And you're kind of like learning how to interview people because conspiracy

1210
01:14:53.591 --> 01:14:55.060
theorists or like street dogs,

1211
01:14:55.061 --> 01:14:57.850
they'd been beaten down a lot that they're very sensitive.

1212
01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.490
So I kind of just have this thing where it's like,

1213
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:04.270
I'm assuming everything you are saying you believe in,

1214
01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:05.590
I just want to hear what you believe.

1215
01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:09.230
So I kind of go with instead of just like checking everybody all the time.

1216
01:15:09.250 --> 01:15:12.130
I mean if it's a really crazy thing I'll go,
okay,

1217
01:15:12.131 --> 01:15:14.740
I don't necessarily believe you checked.
What have you checked that you're like,

1218
01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.650
ah,
come on.
Well you know it's like I had this guy come on,

1219
01:15:17.651 --> 01:15:21.460
there's this thing within the conspiracy community called Q anonymous.

1220
01:15:21.610 --> 01:15:25.880
He's been dropping breadcrumbs about all the shit going on with Trump and the

1221
01:15:25.890 --> 01:15:30.040
CIA and all.
It's like so excited.
Like if you get into conspiracies,

1222
01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:33.700
this is the golden era of conspiracy.
I'm sure.

1223
01:15:33.701 --> 01:15:37.930
I'm sure it is the best.
And then gotten into the Annunaki.

1224
01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:42.100
So you,
but you do question this dude when someone says something like this.
Yeah,

1225
01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:45.850
well it's like this 85 year old man comes on start and he's like,

1226
01:15:46.090 --> 01:15:48.610
tell me all about the Annunaki and all this stuff.
So it's like,

1227
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.350
I just like to hear it okay to,
I've heard crazy stories from you lizard people.

1228
01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:55.300
I'm into that of your family.

1229
01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:58.150
So I was going to ask you is like you're telling me like stories about,

1230
01:15:58.450 --> 01:16:00.390
yeah POVs whatever brother.

1231
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:03.790
What do they think of your,

1232
01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:07.570
are they conspiracy types or are they like I just did an episode with my dad and

1233
01:16:07.571 --> 01:16:12.060
which we talked about conspiracies and he's totally into it.
He is,
he's all dude.

1234
01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:15.760
He told me very young,
don't believe anything you see and half full.

1235
01:16:15.850 --> 01:16:18.190
Don't believe anything you hear and half of what you see.

1236
01:16:18.670 --> 01:16:22.360
So it's always kind of been like my whole thing.
Is he into some big ones?

1237
01:16:22.570 --> 01:16:24.820
Oh yeah dude,
like JFK and all that stuff.

1238
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:28.240
You know for me the first conspiracy I knew someone was up was when the iron

1239
01:16:28.241 --> 01:16:32.050
sheik got busted with a hacksaw.
Jim Dugan in a car and I'm like,

1240
01:16:32.051 --> 01:16:33.550
you guys are supposed to hate each other.

1241
01:16:33.730 --> 01:16:37.060
And even though I knew wrestling's fake,
I was like,
okay,
that's craziness.

1242
01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:40.330
And then over time there's all this crazy stuff.
What's his,

1243
01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:44.400
does he have a JFK lane?
Cause I know there's multiple lanes for the,
you know,

1244
01:16:44.410 --> 01:16:47.020
he knew something was up that that's where,

1245
01:16:47.050 --> 01:16:50.740
that's where the term conspiracy theory comes from is to,

1246
01:16:50.890 --> 01:16:55.890
is to CIA creating the term or basically promoting the term to kind of demonize

1247
01:16:57.521 --> 01:17:01.480
anybody who questioned the shooting.
Ah.
And then it's from there.

1248
01:17:01.481 --> 01:17:05.140
It's just crazy shit.
I had 11.
You have a uh,

1249
01:17:05.170 --> 01:17:07.840
JFK theory just because I feel like that's the most famous,

1250
01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:10.490
I think he was killed by the Federal Reserve,

1251
01:17:10.491 --> 01:17:14.240
the mob and other CIA altogether.
They all were,

1252
01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:19.130
it was a big event actually.
People flew in for it and you know,

1253
01:17:19.131 --> 01:17:22.700
then you go to nine 11 and there's all that crazy shit that went on with that.

1254
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:27.320
And then there's just so much.
I just love it,
dude.
I love studying at all.

1255
01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:29.480
People love it.
It's fun.
Yeah.
I might get,

1256
01:17:29.481 --> 01:17:33.190
some people don't want to hear it and I think some people are kind of afraid,
uh,

1257
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:37.220
what's going on and where the world is.
And that's fine too.
I get it.
You know,

1258
01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:39.380
some people like to watch the news,
I like to go and read it.

1259
01:17:39.381 --> 01:17:42.920
And just go deep and sure.
Then you see all this crazy shit going on.

1260
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:45.620
I just love it dude.
I just like to hear about it.

1261
01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:47.970
We have footage of um,

1262
01:17:48.170 --> 01:17:52.160
one of the Sam Tripoli's ex girlfriends was in the news,

1263
01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:54.920
so I don't know if you want to comment on her at all.

1264
01:17:57.650 --> 01:18:01.650
Oh yeah.
You saw her?
Yeah,
the 65,000.
Yeah.
Texts.

1265
01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:04.720
<v 15>I felt like I met my soul mate and everything was just the way it was and I</v>

1266
01:18:04.721 --> 01:18:07.180
thought we would just do what everybody else did and we were just like,

1267
01:18:07.181 --> 01:18:09.400
get married and everything would be fine.
But that's not what happened.

1268
01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:10.241
<v 16>Right now,</v>

1269
01:18:10.241 --> 01:18:14.800
the valley woman accused of stalking a wealthy businessman is sharing her side

1270
01:18:14.801 --> 01:18:16.630
of the story from behind bars.

1271
01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:20.740
Police say that she texted the victims tens of thousands of times.
Guys,

1272
01:18:20.741 --> 01:18:23.230
this woman says she came from Florida to find love.

1273
01:18:23.470 --> 01:18:27.760
Now she claims a man she's accused of stalking is her soulmate because of her

1274
01:18:27.761 --> 01:18:31.390
superstitious beliefs and a particular number.

1275
01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:33.230
<v 15>It's following the number 33.</v>

1276
01:18:33.231 --> 01:18:37.190
I used to wake up every day and every night at three 33 33

1277
01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:41.880
<v 16>Jacqueline clear adis telling the 12 news about her beliefs tied to the number</v>

1278
01:18:41.881 --> 01:18:42.930
33 hmm.

1279
01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:47.310
<v 7>And that's kind of what happens is like the crazy people getting the news and</v>

1280
01:18:47.311 --> 01:18:51.960
all the shit.
There's a lot of numerology,
stuff like that.
It's all there,
dude.

1281
01:18:51.961 --> 01:18:55.230
If you sit down,
you listen to these people,
it's like crazy shit.
Let's see,

1282
01:18:55.231 --> 01:18:56.190
let's see.
I'll click crazy shit.

1283
01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:58.210
<v 16>Got It.
So I kept following the number and he said,
well,</v>

1284
01:18:58.211 --> 01:19:02.860
she claims that what led her to a Paradise Valley businessman she met on the

1285
01:19:02.861 --> 01:19:04.120
dating app.
Look,
see?

1286
01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:08.580
<v 15>Then I find out he does stuff with the Dead Sea.
The Dead Sea has 33% salt in it.</v>

1287
01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:11.370
<v 16>The common ground between the two,
the same birthday,</v>

1288
01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:16.640
convincing her even more that he's her match between the two,

1289
01:19:16.830 --> 01:19:20.760
the same birthday,
convincing her that he's her match.

1290
01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:24.210
Our brothers are both named Jacob and David,
both vegetarians,

1291
01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:27.480
but police say the multimillionaire didn't feel the same way.

1292
01:19:27.630 --> 01:19:30.150
He called the authorities on her numerous times,

1293
01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:34.470
including last month when cops found adis trespassing inside his house,

1294
01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:36.780
taking a bath.
And I don't want to talk about that.

1295
01:19:37.290 --> 01:19:41.760
<v 7>That's really wild.
And you're shrinking it.
Someone's home and just take a bath.</v>

1296
01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:46.050
Yeah.
Like they,
um,
you know that serial killer,
the one that killed that Versace?

1297
01:19:46.230 --> 01:19:49.380
Yeah,
he would,
um,
he killed like five guys,
right?
Yeah.

1298
01:19:49.710 --> 01:19:52.680
And one of the things he would do and a lot of the homes just like make

1299
01:19:52.681 --> 01:19:54.960
sandwiches.
Really,
that was his thing.
Well,

1300
01:19:54.961 --> 01:19:57.210
he would just go in there and like chill out,

1301
01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:01.410
see what food they had for he killed them or before.
Um,

1302
01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:05.550
well see both,
because sometimes he would arrive and no one,
like,

1303
01:20:05.551 --> 01:20:08.460
he was kind of waiting for to get home,
so he would just eat.

1304
01:20:08.850 --> 01:20:12.420
I remember when they contacted as a dad,
they're like,
Yah,

1305
01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:17.310
any truth to your son is the,
uh,
gay serial killer.
He's like,
he's not gay.

1306
01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:21.960
He didn't,
there was a serial killer.
That's great.

1307
01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:25.080
That's great.
You know,
here's the thing.
I,
I lived in Vegas for awhile.

1308
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:28.670
Crazy shit comes in good looking packages.
Yeah.

1309
01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:32.970
Like with men for the most part when a man's crazy eight effects.

1310
01:20:33.210 --> 01:20:34.320
But for some reason,

1311
01:20:35.190 --> 01:20:40.190
great reason women could hide like batshit crazy comes in very fuckable package

1312
01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:44.670
<v 0>just but,
and usually the hotter they are,
I can look at those office though.</v>

1313
01:20:44.671 --> 01:20:47.490
Right?
Like you see those eyes and the eyebrows.

1314
01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:51.090
It's always in the Brower Brower too.
But,
but you know,

1315
01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:56.070
I would know 100% immediately looking at this woman that is dangerous.

1316
01:20:56.130 --> 01:20:59.940
<v 7>So all right,
so this girl is probably like 30 right?
Probably.
Right.</v>

1317
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.900
And the guy she's probably hitting on is like 55 and like when you get into the

1318
01:21:03.901 --> 01:21:06.960
fifties girls in their twenties and thirties can do no wrong.

1319
01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:10.770
You always see these older comics taking these super young female comics on the

1320
01:21:10.771 --> 01:21:12.180
road.
She's really funny.

1321
01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:16.910
<v 0>Is She?
Yeah,
she really funny.
We don't have to give examples.
No,</v>

1322
01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:17.730
no we won't.

1323
01:21:17.730 --> 01:21:22.200
One thing I always think about when somebody breaks into someone's house and

1324
01:21:22.201 --> 01:21:26.490
goes and makes food from their fridge,
like would you trust a stranger's fridge?

1325
01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:29.700
Just cause so much shit.
And ours is old and outdated.
Like,

1326
01:21:29.701 --> 01:21:31.410
how do you know what you can and can't eat?

1327
01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:33.520
<v 7>Sure.
Killer at that point,</v>

1328
01:21:33.521 --> 01:21:36.600
I don't know really worried about like fucking calorie intake

1329
01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:39.700
<v 0>at that point.
I'm worried about getting food poisoning or something.
Yeah,</v>

1330
01:21:39.701 --> 01:21:41.380
but that's your obsession.
You're like,
oh fuck.

1331
01:21:41.381 --> 01:21:44.260
How am I going to get away with murder if I get food poisoning?

1332
01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:48.790
Christina would do.
She would break into someone's home and then kill them over.

1333
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:50.330
They're outdated food.
Yeah.

1334
01:21:50.350 --> 01:21:54.070
I'd be so mad just shoving bad hot dogs up there and milk's expired.

1335
01:21:54.071 --> 01:21:56.530
Get the fuck Outta here please.
Documents reveal.

1336
01:21:56.531 --> 01:21:59.440
She texted him 65,000 times.

1337
01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:05.050
She to do hard time for this.
Many of those messages.
Did you hear her?

1338
01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:09.840
She goes,
I thousand times.
That's it.
Let me see.

1339
01:22:09.841 --> 01:22:14.841
Like more many of those messages show disturbing delusions of murder and hey,

1340
01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:19.600
I want to talk about that,
but she admits he blocked her number.

1341
01:22:19.690 --> 01:22:23.590
I told him if he ever blocked me on what's APP that I would kind of move here.

1342
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:27.430
Oh,
do blocked me.
Oh Man.
Yeah.
I mean,

1343
01:22:27.431 --> 01:22:31.420
you think he waited for 65,000 messages before he blocked her,

1344
01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.230
but she's clearly mentally ill.
Yeah.

1345
01:22:33.231 --> 01:22:37.360
I would've blocked her at like 2030 I'm like,
oh,
this chick's crazy.

1346
01:22:37.390 --> 01:22:38.940
I could see her killing somebody and yeah,

1347
01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:43.010
<v 7>I'm really good at talking people off the ledge.
Or You,</v>

1348
01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:46.020
I know when people are crazy,
you kind of talk them off.
How do you tell?

1349
01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:47.480
How do you do it?
Just you.
You know?

1350
01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:52.430
You just can't find if there's a soul in that dead wood,
right?
Yeah.

1351
01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.470
And you just gotta try it.

1352
01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:57.500
I think people at the end of the day just want to be treated like a human being

1353
01:22:57.501 --> 01:23:01.550
and you just kind of slowly got to take them.
You know?

1354
01:23:01.670 --> 01:23:05.530
She's probably hooked on his Dick Smack to you think so.
You ever meet like,

1355
01:23:05.730 --> 01:23:09.940
like this sex call,
like these dudes get these girls,
the brand themselves.

1356
01:23:09.941 --> 01:23:10.810
I can't even get chicks.

1357
01:23:10.811 --> 01:23:14.680
Give me hand jobs and this guy's getting a fucking gardening Keith.

1358
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:19.300
He runs a fucking cult named Keith.
Yeah.
Branding.

1359
01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:24.140
Getting random chicks are branding themselves.
Jesus Christ investigator.

1360
01:23:24.141 --> 01:23:27.850
See Jacqueline showed up last crazy eyes that says I love anal.

1361
01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:29.380
Those high stripe as white.

1362
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:32.050
She says she got a text message through a fake number.

1363
01:23:32.290 --> 01:23:35.410
A number she thought was from her dream,
man.
I was like,

1364
01:23:35.411 --> 01:23:40.411
please don't tell me that this is you sending me fake text messages because you

1365
01:23:40.721 --> 01:23:43.000
want me to come over and say you're calling the police on me again.

1366
01:23:43.570 --> 01:23:45.150
<v 3>She may be afraid of,
you know,</v>

1367
01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:50.060
ever warn you that he was going to call the police.
He didn't stop texting.
No.

1368
01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:51.990
<v 7>Now in court documents,</v>

1369
01:23:51.991 --> 01:23:56.991
there is a box that's checked indicating that she's mentally disturbed and bars

1370
01:23:57.330 --> 01:24:01.710
with no bond.
Girls going heavy on the makeup haunts like the Rodeo clown makeup.

1371
01:24:01.711 --> 01:24:05.430
She's rocking right there.
Why are they treating this like a normal story?

1372
01:24:05.431 --> 01:24:07.380
Like I know her.
She's mentally so clear.

1373
01:24:07.381 --> 01:24:10.110
That's kind of her fault that's bothering me.
That they're like,

1374
01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:14.970
she's just a lady that over did it.
She's not.
She's clearly offer Rockerman.

1375
01:24:15.010 --> 01:24:19.950
Yeah,
stop treating it like it's a normal no.
Oh my God.
No,
I love him so much.

1376
01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:23.070
Yeah,
she's got like,
see,
that's the problem with this country is like,

1377
01:24:23.071 --> 01:24:26.670
he doesn't like it.
Then I'll go home and I love my explanations.

1378
01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.290
What am I supposed to do?

1379
01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:32.280
And she's great point of love is to keep giving it best fit math equation.

1380
01:24:32.281 --> 01:24:36.540
It's love equals 3.3,
which is infinity.
Yeah.
I mean,

1381
01:24:36.541 --> 01:24:38.970
it's clear she's got mental problems.

1382
01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:42.390
She can't think clearly and great guests on the podcast.
I would love that.

1383
01:24:42.450 --> 01:24:46.230
We'll break it down.
I just wanna know like these girls would go on these,

1384
01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:51.060
these millionaire websites.
It's just like you're asking for trouble.

1385
01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:52.770
No.
Right.

1386
01:24:52.890 --> 01:24:56.340
I mean like you're looking for something that doesn't necessarily,

1387
01:24:56.850 --> 01:25:01.380
not that I'm saying bang broke Dick's by any,
I mean,
I would totally not,

1388
01:25:01.381 --> 01:25:05.280
but it's just like you're looking for a certain type of person right there.

1389
01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:08.610
I just think it leads to trouble.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's fine.

1390
01:25:08.611 --> 01:25:09.780
It's not like they're real love.

1391
01:25:09.810 --> 01:25:14.340
It's not a good idea to be on either side of the millionaire site,
millionaire,

1392
01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:17.640
a sugar baby thing.
So weird.

1393
01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:22.340
<v 4>Um,
real quick,
uh,
someone says,
I just want to throw out a thank you.</v>

1394
01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:23.810
You might not think of your podcast.

1395
01:25:23.811 --> 01:25:26.030
It's something that can help people in their everyday lives.

1396
01:25:26.570 --> 01:25:28.160
I'm a 40 year old white,

1397
01:25:28.161 --> 01:25:32.960
cisgender male kind of detective for police department.
What we receive,

1398
01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:36.740
little to no training about the LGTBQ plus community.

1399
01:25:37.250 --> 01:25:39.920
Just recently I was assigned to investigate a robbery assault case.

1400
01:25:39.921 --> 01:25:42.980
I met with the victim multiple face piercings,
cuts on the arms,

1401
01:25:42.981 --> 01:25:44.030
should let me know right away.

1402
01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:47.400
She in parentheses and quotation marks was non-binary.

1403
01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:50.990
If it wasn't for the podcast,
I would have been like,
what the fuck is that?

1404
01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:53.810
Then I thought about your podcast and wanted to laugh.

1405
01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:56.960
Then the scene from lethal weapon popped in my head with Murdoch saying,

1406
01:25:57.110 --> 01:26:00.020
I'm too old for this shit,
but I'm a professional.
I quickly replied,

1407
01:26:00.021 --> 01:26:02.030
what's Your Pronoun?
Oh Wow.

1408
01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:06.800
This person had a look on their face and said that she is fine.
Oh,

1409
01:26:06.801 --> 01:26:10.910
so she's not buying it,
but that that she referred to herself as she.

1410
01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:14.160
She tried to tell me what happened,
but would lose track and go off something.

1411
01:26:14.161 --> 01:26:15.830
Mel,
she showed me all the text messages,

1412
01:26:16.190 --> 01:26:18.110
Facebook posts between her and the suspects.

1413
01:26:18.111 --> 01:26:20.840
I had to decipher who did what to who.

1414
01:26:20.841 --> 01:26:24.530
Since everyone was describing her as a he and the multiple suspects with

1415
01:26:24.531 --> 01:26:28.180
different pronouns that were involved.
I ended up giving her my card,

1416
01:26:28.190 --> 01:26:31.070
asked her that.
She emailed me with a detailed statement.

1417
01:26:31.290 --> 01:26:33.290
Just wanted you guys know.

1418
01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:37.990
<v 0>Wait a minute.
Hold on my Pronoun High and tight,
Kevin.
Well,
how about that?</v>

1419
01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:41.380
Thanks Kev.
N N?
No,
I call him.

1420
01:26:41.381 --> 01:26:44.830
Kevin doesn't want to be called that as his son.
His keeping the streets safe.

1421
01:26:44.850 --> 01:26:47.290
They didn't give their pronouns.
No,
but that's,
how about that?

1422
01:26:47.291 --> 01:26:50.700
This podcast helped to detective in the Trans Community.
See,

1423
01:26:50.710 --> 01:26:54.460
he really would it well,
as soon as that person,
I'm sorry,
the not trans.

1424
01:26:54.461 --> 01:26:59.460
It's a bite nine binary.
It's different.
Am I a gender identity?
I try to be sent,

1425
01:26:59.461 --> 01:27:02.710
so I'm just saying my syllables.
Sammy of mount up.
Where'd you get that hat?

1426
01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:08.260
Which,
oh,
it's a are most man.
I have a buddy of mine.
Oh really?
Armenians dude.

1427
01:27:08.261 --> 01:27:12.280
Yeah,
this rack thing.
Boom.
Oh,
that's cool.
Makes us some really great shirts.

1428
01:27:12.281 --> 01:27:16.360
And I wears hats whenever I can.
This is my buddy's podcasts.
Uh,

1429
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:20.290
he's kind of the top dog in the conspiracy world podcast,

1430
01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:23.420
higher side chats.
He goes deep.
Um,

1431
01:27:24.210 --> 01:27:27.160
one of the things we do on this show,
we want to have you on the podcast.

1432
01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:27.880
We'll do it.

1433
01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:30.610
I like to have you both and we won't go into the weird shit that will make you

1434
01:27:30.611 --> 01:27:33.940
uncomfortable.
I'm not uncomfortable.
I just don't know anything.

1435
01:27:34.090 --> 01:27:36.360
Well that's what's kind of fun to bring you on and talk about it.

1436
01:27:36.370 --> 01:27:40.270
Dope when it hears.
The,
another thing we do is we always come up with,
um,

1437
01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:43.740
alternative names for cities when we do our dates.
Yeah.

1438
01:27:43.810 --> 01:27:47.650
And we always try to make them juvenile and silly.
So for instance,
Jacksonville,

1439
01:27:47.890 --> 01:27:52.360
when I plug it,
I'll say Jack me off hill.
Yeah.
Orlando's horror.
Lando,

1440
01:27:52.630 --> 01:27:54.720
Pittsburgh,
Pittsburgh and so on.
Yeah.

1441
01:27:55.420 --> 01:27:58.020
We were that we realized we didn't have one for Los Angeles.
Yeah.

1442
01:27:58.150 --> 01:28:02.040
So people devastated.

It's phenomenal.
Phenomenal.

1453
01:28:42.641 --> 01:28:47.470
Tampa is to tap on Tampon is for sure.

They're number two on my super freak big board.
Who's number one?

1457
01:29:00.690 --> 01:29:02.220
Mexicans.
Yeah,

1458
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:03.410
<v 7>all there.
The Er,</v>

1459
01:29:03.450 --> 01:29:07.950
they can just walk that fine line between being able to meet your mom and angel

1460
01:29:07.951 --> 01:29:11.010
on the first day.
You know what I'm saying?
Like it's fun.
Oh,
Mexican girls,

1461
01:29:11.370 --> 01:29:15.030
Mexican girls.
Oh yeah.
Before it gets too late here,

1462
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:19.110
we encouraging um,
our listeners to hit up Cardi B,

1463
01:29:21.290 --> 01:29:24.810
Christina and Cardi B are doing the same day.
Oh,
that makes,

1464
01:29:24.811 --> 01:29:29.670
so we're just trying to get people into that.
That'd be great.
Um,
so they're,

1465
01:29:29.671 --> 01:29:33.390
they're sending these tweets out to Cardi B I saw,
you know,

1466
01:29:33.391 --> 01:29:35.250
a hundred last words of them.

1467
01:29:35.340 --> 01:29:38.250
They're saying Cardi B are having babies at the same time and they keep tagging

1468
01:29:38.251 --> 01:29:42.210
her.
She is,
I am Cardi B,
we just went Cardi B to see it and say something.

1469
01:29:42.211 --> 01:29:45.750
So I think she should,
you're bullied very famous mothers,

1470
01:29:45.751 --> 01:29:48.930
you know that you're due to have your baby while the famous Christina P is

1471
01:29:48.931 --> 01:29:52.710
having hers.
Is this a publicity stunt?
What if she knew that?

1472
01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:56.760
I just want acknowledgement from her because it's like you knew I was getting

1473
01:29:56.761 --> 01:30:00.630
pregnant in October.
You planned it to,
and you know what I mean.
Yeah.

1474
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:05.550
We're friends.
We're bros.
It's kind of like a,
you know,
uh,

1475
01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:08.100
Avengers,
infinity wars.

1476
01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:11.100
And then they had like the legion,

1477
01:30:11.610 --> 01:30:15.750
the Legion of superheroes to DC version,
which was a very bad version.

1478
01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:19.440
So you have yours,
which is the affinity of wars and she's having hers,

1479
01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:24.330
which is the all hall of justice or the Legion of Justice Batman.

1480
01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:28.920
It was just not good.
It was just not good.
She combined forces work together.

not comedy,
a tinfoil hat with Sam Tripoli.

1484
01:30:43.321 --> 01:30:45.870
And then punch drunk.
What?
Ours feared Jason Tebow.

1485
01:30:46.290 --> 01:30:48.850
And you can see him live doing the show in both sides.

1488
01:30:57.331 --> 01:30:58.470

1489
01:30:58.710 --> 01:31:02.790
and then we're June 1st at cops and June 2nd at Sacramento.
Punchline.
