You'd have a super moves.

11
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.110
[inaudible] what's your name about that boy?

12
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.010
The head.
I'm a self trained punch.
Honestly with my dad.
Some smell of his peers.

13
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.290
A sentiments as a few loads of come cause you know that I'm bad.

14
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.450
I ain't got no tail.
Put that bug in my ass.
It just like the gays.

15
00:01:28.451 --> 00:01:33.140
What do you remember your dad?
You got to be coming as the symbol pub.

16
00:01:33.141 --> 00:01:38.141
Does a good mom to Thomas in the crevice of you per se.

17
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.490
But again,
budget.
Do you know how much money my smile is?
I've got a really bad,

18
00:01:43.491 --> 00:01:45.970
bad,
got a really bad light.
Calming does take.

19
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.570
Just slip it alone.
This

20
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.570
big huge mass glass and now here Eric de

21
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.840
[inaudible]
ride on his ass and beat.

22
00:02:02.841 --> 00:02:04.630
You heard this is how I you did.

23
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.360
Can you just to the tune,

24
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.430
I'm going to drink
this please shower.

25
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.240
Get away from DPH.
You Shit.

26
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.890
That's glass,
glass,

27
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.730
glass,
glass,
glass,
glass.
Slash the most.

28
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.833
<v 0>There you go.</v>

29
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.010
That is of all the songs we played on this show,

30
00:02:46.011 --> 00:02:50.450
I would say that is one of the most beloved people have just been tweeting and

31
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.510
emailing about it.
I absolutely loved the closing song,
young past episode.

32
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.380
How eyeglass produced by chef.
Um,
that was uh,
yeah,

33
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:04.210
I mean I got so many messages,
particularly get them,
uh,
you know,
a lot of songs,

34
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:07.240
but my goodness,
that closed out in the last episode,

35
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:12.160
I think three 82 and uh,
I keep getting messages about it.
Yeah.
It's really,

36
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:16.480
and that's,
that's rare.
Just like a double pipe classic.
Yeah.
Way to go young.

37
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:17.290
Patriotic.

38
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.050
<v 4>Thank you for doing so.
That's glass.
Let's glass tilted</v>

39
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.800
to camera.
Yeah,
it looks tilted.
It's tilted right?

40
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.990
It looks a little.
Yeah.
Let me see.
Hold on.
That's weird.

41
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.060
But the framing looks

42
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.530
<v 5>it's not leaning.</v>

43
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.140
Alright.
Right.
Like when you look down at it,

44
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.700
<v 0>I guess I can't really tell.
It's tilted down.
Okay.
All right.</v>

45
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.400
Now and I tilted down.
Alright.
Um,

46
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.910
quick listen to this for all my audio files here.

47
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.493
Um,

48
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.770
so you remember like a month ago when the computer took a shit man and it turns

49
00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:12.030
out like I,
it showed no output.
There was um,
that's all good to apple.

50
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.370
I had to replace a logic board.
Yeah.

51
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.940
I just went to a sec cause I worked with two computers now.
Same thing.

52
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.080
No output again.
So weird.
Yeah.

53
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.530
And I had it plugged in and it was just doing like some crazy noise like no.

54
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.700
Yeah.
Oh boy.
So I think the logic board is shot again,

55
00:04:26.701 --> 00:04:29.520
but I don't understand how that's happening.
I don't know.

56
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:31.980
You have bad luck with technology.
Yeah.

57
00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:36.150
But I mean all I did was just plug into it.
So yeah.
I don't know dude.

58
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.730
<v 4>You know what?
My speaker on my,
my phone is acting up.
I can't hear as well.</v>

59
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.270
That'd be getting older.
I like it really loud.
My phone.
You're like,
I,

60
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.240
I don't even know what,
what you're saying right now.
Tell you I am getting older.

61
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.280
I feel as though there's like,

62
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.690
by the end of the day I can't compute what you're saying to me.
Like yesterday.

63
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.640
You are trying to explain to me about keys and the door and which keys go in

64
00:05:01.641 --> 00:05:04.340
there.
And I was like,
Babe,
Babe,
save it for tomorrow.
Yeah.

65
00:05:04.341 --> 00:05:05.570
You give up at a certain point.

66
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.940
I think by eight 40 I'm in.
I'm in my jammer.
No,

67
00:05:10.941 --> 00:05:14.960
by eight o'clock I'm in my pajamas.
Yeah.
Hey,
excuse me.

68
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.330
And then nine o'clock it's lights out.
You schnitzel.
Excuse me.

69
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.380
By the way,
Schnitzel weighs about 10 pounds more than she did,

70
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.450
but before we moved here.
Enormous.
Why she's so big.
It's like,

71
00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:33.130
it's that is the heat on in here?
No,
it's not right.
No.
Okay,

72
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.460
good.
It feels warm.
Well,
I know today it's hot out.
Yeah,
I'm in a while.
Yeah.

73
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.820
Hashtag Betsey's fat Hashtag [inaudible] what are they seeing?
They're,

74
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.530
they're freaking out.
Who knows?
Jesus,
nothing as usual.
They're reflections.

75
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.990
Hold on one second.
What you doing?

76
00:05:50.991 --> 00:05:55.970
She Nitze come here.
Fatty.
Come here.
Let's see how fat you are.
Come here,

77
00:05:55.971 --> 00:05:59.450
baby.
Fitzy come here.
Come here.

78
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.280
Look fucking fat.
She is,
she's huge.
She's,
we're not,

79
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:07.310
we're not assholes.
Just kind of look your Straw for sure.
Uh,

80
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.610
it's that it's the cause of the baby.
It's because of maybe some of,

81
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:14.660
we were looking through pictures this morning and back in October,

82
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.500
bitsy was like in the background of one of the pictures with Lj and she was

83
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.030
significantly thinner.

84
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.010
And what's happening is she's eating all of ljs food.

85
00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:28.160
When he drops or whatever,
he,

86
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.600
they checked for the tropics builds over.

87
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.050
She is the vacuum cleaner.
We've got to keep her out of the kitchen.
I don't know.

88
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:36.381
But see,

89
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:40.010
here's the problem is that I'm lazy and I like that we don't have to clean up

90
00:06:40.011 --> 00:06:43.740
the floor.
Naw,
Babe.
Why natures?

91
00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.290
They're nature's cleaners.
That's why you get dog,

92
00:06:46.291 --> 00:06:49.920
so you don't have to clean the floor out of your toddler's she's wound.

93
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.140
He was like a little bird dog.
She should bird on four legs.

94
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.890
It's just like stilts.
Well,
cause usually you're like,

95
00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:00.200
we're the only people that have a 30 pound Brussels.
She's too big.

96
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.120
We got how much should she way Max?
50 dozen.
What third?
No,

97
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.870
what do you think?
She actually weighs probably like 18 or something.

98
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.430
She's alone and she's a sturdy dog.
Like they're not,

99
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:18.450
they're not weak little dogs,
Brussels.
But she's definitely,
we got to curb it.

100
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.020
She's struggling to jump on the couch.

101
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.670
She does.
She does.

102
00:07:25.671 --> 00:07:29.810
Like it looks like she has an OCB cause she takes like five shots at it before

103
00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:34.010
she does it right now.
T three can't get up.
No,
I try.

104
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:35.863
I can't.

105
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.020
Well here's what I'm going to do because I'm not going to stop her eating the

106
00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:40.150
table scraps cause I,

107
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.340
where are we going to lock them out of the kitchen then they're going to go shit

108
00:07:43.341 --> 00:07:44.720
all over the house.
You know how they are.

109
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.430
So I think what I'm going to have to do is like half her dry food.
Yeah.

110
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:54.140
Just half that so that she can just eat the scraps.
You know,

111
00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:58.400
what are we going to do?
And I don't want to clean the floors.
Do you know?

112
00:07:58.401 --> 00:08:01.850
Of course.
So this is the obvious solution.
Cut back the kibble.

113
00:08:01.851 --> 00:08:06.230
Let her eat people's food.
It's not a bad,
it's not a bad solution.

114
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.250
Um,
how has fif not fatter though?

115
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.850
Because he eats the same shit.
It's usually quick on the draw.

116
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:19.010
He goes,
but I think she's beating him all the time.
I think she's,

117
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.640
because she's a little more savvy about food consumption.

118
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:26.240
She sits right under his high chair,
like right there.

119
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.030
And then FIFA is kind of off to the side a little.
He chills.
Yeah.

120
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.360
They're always looking like right now they're looking for crumbs.

121
00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:36.980
I don't know what's going on.
Should we do a proper show open?

122
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.640
Oh Shit.
Yeah,
I forgot it.
Let's do it.
Here we go.
Just like the gays

123
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:46.730
ladies.
I want to do a video about this fucking lady

124
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.610
gars our water.

125
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:04.943
<v 1>Christina,</v>

126
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:37.760
I don't know.
Don't ask me.

127
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.120
I just looked really annoying.

128
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:48.920
<v 0>The uh,
that this one just stop or is when all the audio is like,</v>

129
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:53.930
this is the,
the treasure chest of audience.
This is all the original,

130
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.890
everything.
Right.

131
00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.400
And I just had the logic board replace before that issue and now it's fucked

132
00:09:58.401 --> 00:09:59.990
again.
It's so weird.
Yeah.

133
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:01.301
<v 4>Do you think it is,</v>

134
00:10:01.301 --> 00:10:04.930
and this is so stupid and this is such like a person who doesn't know about

135
00:10:04.931 --> 00:10:08.260
technology and saying something,
so don't get mad at me.
I'm not mad at you.

136
00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:12.280
Do you think it's plugging in and plugging out a lot?

137
00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.000
Like the sound Kiki's we've,
we're always plugging and unplugging.

138
00:10:16.001 --> 00:10:18.130
Like do you think be the constant polling of,

139
00:10:18.131 --> 00:10:21.670
of a thing in and out of the port hole or whatever it is.
It,

140
00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.890
I don't think that should cause a problem,
but yes,

141
00:10:23.891 --> 00:10:26.850
I think that's part of where is something down.
Maybe over time.
I know.

142
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:31.400
<v 0>I Dunno.
I Dunno.
But here cute though.
I love you.
Thank you.
I love you too.</v>

143
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:36.140
Very handsome man.
Uh,
thank you.
Thank you.
It's Valentine's Day.
It is.

144
00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:40.550
As we record this,
talked to my dad today.
He goes,
buddy,

145
00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:46.100
that's your mom cars in a flower.
Well yeah.

146
00:10:46.101 --> 00:10:47.630
He goes,
yeah,
she tells me not to,

147
00:10:47.631 --> 00:10:52.490
but it's like you something [inaudible] and Lan ladies say,

148
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:57.680
don't worry,
I'll get me anything.
They don't mean it.
They don't,

149
00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.010
they generally don't.
It's absolute truth but eyes.

150
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.550
But he's also been saying that to me for like 30 years.

151
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:08.060
But your mom is the type that she actually secretly wants stuff.

152
00:11:08.061 --> 00:11:11.180
Of course she won't ever be like,
don't get me anything this year.

153
00:11:11.181 --> 00:11:15.250
I'm telling you,
I got nothing.
I got nothing to so you can be upset with me.

154
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:20.360
I'm not upset.
I have,
I've done nothing for you.
Absolutely.
I listen.

155
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:25.150
I got you.
I got you a baby.
I got you baby.
That's the present.

156
00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:26.373
That's it.

157
00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.760
<v 4>No,
I don't believe I,
you know,</v>

158
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:32.430
I think you and I celebrate Valentine's Day all year long quite.

159
00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:33.950
And I mean that quite honestly,

160
00:11:33.951 --> 00:11:37.060
that I feel as though you and I have a good thing going.

161
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:42.070
Three 65 so it's one day that I just don't like being told what to do.

162
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.740
I don't like being told that we have to look

163
00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.470
<v 0>nothing.
Yeah.</v>

164
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:52.500
I ate the pussy and always wanting us to love their calm,

165
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.350
to just love

166
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.590
licking it and how she bodies and swallowing it.

167
00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:02.870
Who put guys are you dating?
So we're that.
She makes these videos,
guys,

168
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.670
card partner about their time.

169
00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:10.730
She got it sounds like a muppet or something like sesame street now.

170
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.230
And here's the thing,
I other,

171
00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:16.950
there's Beethoven and Mozart over Costco over her shoulders.
She's super culture,

172
00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:21.750
urban culture versus talking about their car.
And so anyway,

173
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.000
she's got great teeth.
But the thing is,

174
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.050
and all the men that I've been with and had spent a lot,

175
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.510
so many Cox,
I don't know of any guys that have been like,

176
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:38.250
I want you to really enjoy my cup.
I need you to swallow it.
Love it.

177
00:12:38.251 --> 00:12:41.930
Lap it up.
Let me put it like I dunno,
I dunno who this bitch is dating.

178
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:46.710
She's dating some real fucking animals.
Clear.
Yeah.

179
00:12:46.711 --> 00:12:51.090
Like what kind of guy are you dating?
Only like what does it,
Tinder hookups.

180
00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.290
She fucks a lot.
Somebody,
what did we find out the story with her?

181
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.190
Remember cause she got to her video,

182
00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.840
we played her another clip she did where she was looking at I'm and

183
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:02.520
uh,

184
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:07.520
I think she was married and then got divorced and then went on a com CommScope

185
00:13:09.131 --> 00:13:13.170
paid.
So now she's on like one of these apps probably just banging out.

186
00:13:13.171 --> 00:13:16.050
Randos she's really jumping on those days,
man.

187
00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:20.300
<v 6>That same guy will never even touch his own commerce,
taste his own car.</v>

188
00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:24.060
<v 0>Why would he seen this happen so many times?
It's so important.
Yeah,</v>

189
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.160
it's a really important,
so board and the guys,
the guys are of waiting.

190
00:13:29.161 --> 00:13:34.110
They're calm then that bothers you?
Or
do you avoid yours?

191
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.360
I mean,
I guess to a certain degree.
I don't know.
I don't avoid it.
No.

192
00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:43.770
I mean I'm not repulsed by it,
but you know you want to clean it up,
right?

193
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.980
Yeah.
I'm not repulsed by it either.
It's not.

194
00:13:46.981 --> 00:13:51.930
It's a non issue really going to taste it like she just like,

195
00:13:51.931 --> 00:13:56.280
that's a problem for her.
I think guys are like,
oh no,
I don't want to taste it.

196
00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.180
Yeah.
Well I guess her point is,
you know,
you want me to taste it?

197
00:14:00.181 --> 00:14:02.670
That's a big deal.
Why don't you taste your com?

198
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:06.600
But not all guys want her to taste it.
She's just say she's in a different,

199
00:14:06.601 --> 00:14:08.220
like a very specific wheelhouse right now.

200
00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.190
She's meeting some guy just want to get it out of them and they don't care if it

201
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.180
tastes like,
just get it out.
I don't care if you taste it,

202
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.250
you know.
I mean,
why do you have,
you don't have to taste it.
I mean,

203
00:14:20.251 --> 00:14:22.770
I know that some people,
that's their,
you know,

204
00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:26.850
some guys who like to taste their own sure that too.

205
00:14:26.851 --> 00:14:31.280
But I'm saying that would it where it would be an issue like this.
Yeah.
She,

206
00:14:31.281 --> 00:14:32.114
she's making it big.

207
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:36.770
<v 6>I'm rubbing it in and I swallow or add to all the stuff with it.
Same Guy.</v>

208
00:14:36.771 --> 00:14:41.300
If his head accidentally brushes against the kiss,
come on,
my body's like,
oh,

209
00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.200
what's that?

210
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:46.000
<v 0>Oh well then he's an asshole.
Like it was fucking really young guys.</v>

211
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:48.610
That's good for you.

212
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:53.600
But I think he's fucking really young teenagers that are like,
yeah.
I'm like,

213
00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:57.020
cause she's saying that that's kind of like a guy being like,
oh my comes gay.

214
00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:58.530
Like touching your own count as gay.

215
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.780
Kind of sounds like it sounds very juvenile.
Does Donald,

216
00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:07.070
she's fucking college guys.
So again,
salute.
But uh,
you know,

217
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:11.570
I don't think most like 40 year old guys are going to dump on her and be like,

218
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.350
Ooh,
I want to touch it at me.
I'm scared of it now.

219
00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:20.120
I swallows come in and kiss him.
He's like,
no,
no,
she's fucking young guys.

220
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:23.360
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Does that,

221
00:15:23.361 --> 00:15:27.080
does that the thing you don't think you care,
you don't care about anything,

222
00:15:27.081 --> 00:15:29.690
nothing phases.
You had all your,

223
00:15:29.691 --> 00:15:34.190
probably the least phaseable of all the dudes I've ever been,

224
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:38.900
which is probably why we're married because nothing phases you like I could

225
00:15:38.901 --> 00:15:43.340
probably just take a shit on and around in and around your mouth.

226
00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:48.710
Like Danny,
Danny,
and you'd be like,
Yep.
You just roll with it.
Yeah,
definitely.

227
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:53.090
I'm ready to go.
Ready to go?
Yeah.
Ready to go.
Karen fresh.

228
00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:56.060
It's Trish now.
We haven't,
we haven't mentioned that on,

229
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:59.330
we mentioned that on the live show,
but not,
I guess we should park for a second.

230
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:04.700
Tell everybody holy shit.
Thank you for coming to the live show.
Oh my God.
Uh,

231
00:16:04.701 --> 00:16:08.870
to,
to,
to back to back podcasts in Irvine.
So fun.

232
00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.530
Sold out A's in crowds.
Uh,
second one had Yoshi,

233
00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:16.100
one of our all time hall of fame gusts,

234
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:21.260
Yoshi Obayashi and I'm not,
she'll got wild by the way.
That was such,

235
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:22.910
that might be our were filthy.

236
00:16:22.911 --> 00:16:27.230
That might be our filthiest show ever between the content,
like the drops,

237
00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:32.270
Yoshi,
having a microphone,
audience members,
wink,
wink.

238
00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:37.040
It was a fucking disgust fest,
but it was really fun and it's Super Fun.

239
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.070
But I feel like they want it to go on that journey.
Of course it was like,

240
00:16:40.071 --> 00:16:43.900
it was a mutual thing.
Whose House is it right to my mom's house.
Like,
yeah man,

241
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:48.470
do what we want.
It's fun.
It was really fun.
And just so that everybody knows,

242
00:16:48.471 --> 00:16:53.180
people have asked both shows will be available for download.

243
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.320
Um,

244
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.970
I think the first we're going to do the early show you in a week or two and then

245
00:16:58.971 --> 00:17:01.350
the late show will come out all week or two later and they won't,

246
00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:06.010
they won't be in place of regular episodes.
They will be in addition to,
so yeah,

247
00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:09.280
it's like a bonus.
So like your bonus,
it won't replace the regular no,
no,

248
00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:12.110
no programming.
Um,
right.

249
00:17:12.111 --> 00:17:17.111
So one of the revelations we had a at the live show is that Bobby and Karen is

250
00:17:18.231 --> 00:17:20.000
now Jay.
It's different.
Yeah.

251
00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:24.290
Bobby and Karen were our,
um,

252
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.810
our,
what's it called?

253
00:17:26.811 --> 00:17:31.811
Roleplay names when we make love and I pick you up at a bar and like you act

254
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:39.080
like you smoke.
So at the bar and I'm like,
uh,
I play Bobby,

255
00:17:39.081 --> 00:17:43.850
you play Karen and we do it.
I throw you out.
And Bobby's kind of a rebel,

256
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:49.170
you know,
he drives a fucking GTO and he's just like,
you don't give a fuck.

257
00:17:49.171 --> 00:17:50.130
You know,
he's probably

258
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.960
<v 4>got a few families in different cities mean I wouldn't call them families.</v>

259
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:58.410
He's got kids in different cities and states,
but that's who I am.

260
00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:00.960
I'm Bobby,
your Bobby and you're never,

261
00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:04.620
I can't ever expect you to be monogamous or faithful are called call me

262
00:18:04.621 --> 00:18:08.460
regularly or even text back.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
That's Karen.
By the way.

263
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.230
Karen and Karen always wants to change Bobby.
Well,

264
00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:17.130
I was sort of carrying more like a dump truck.
Like she was just like us.

265
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:21.420
So happy to have even a moment of attention.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then,

266
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:25.710
and she was willing to take the abuse,
didn't have any idea that,

267
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.120
I feel like Trish is a little higher up on that.
Like,

268
00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:31.890
yeah.
Interesting.

269
00:18:31.891 --> 00:18:36.891
So maybe she can get Bobby to be an upstanding,

270
00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:42.030
well,
what why we started with Karen is that I was drinking wine and you're like,

271
00:18:42.031 --> 00:18:45.600
oh,
I liked that wine breath.
Like that's a real trashy girl.

272
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:49.250
That's a Karen breath.
And that's how that started.
And then I was right,

273
00:18:49.251 --> 00:18:53.610
it was wine breath,
it was wine breath and it's like,
Barbara smells really nice.

274
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:58.080
And then I left a note on your car because we were,

275
00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:01.050
we were leaving in place and we were parked in the same parking lot.

276
00:19:01.051 --> 00:19:04.490
And I saw your car and I thought it'd be funny to put a note on there.
Yeah.

277
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.000
Well I don't even remember what I was like,
Hey,
you want a date?
Yeah,
Trish,

278
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.970
call me Trish.
Change it on the spot,
on the spot.
Just the name change,

279
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.720
change my game and it,
but it changed mine too because yeah,

280
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:18.300
Trish is a little more confident,
you know what I'm saying?

281
00:19:18.301 --> 00:19:20.700
Like Trish goes after the guy she wants,

282
00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:25.080
she wants Bobby and should I go get him shingle and land them?

283
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:29.280
But Bobby might text her every now and they'd be,
he'll be like,
I'm up.

284
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:32.970
You are down to fuck.
Right.
But Karen doesn't even get that.

285
00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:38.040
Karen's got to go find him in the bar and then he would never pursue Karen.
Yeah,

286
00:19:38.041 --> 00:19:40.950
he's just like to go to sleep and Karen Lawson and he's like,
all right,

287
00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.910
Trish is like the her games elevated.

288
00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:48.210
I think you have a little more respect for Trish a little bit,

289
00:19:48.211 --> 00:19:51.170
but I mean I have more respect for everybody.
Then Karen,

290
00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:55.590
Karen's a dump truck and he said,
fucking mop just to come up.

291
00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:00.690
What do you say to Karen when we're done?
Get Out.

292
00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.650
Shut up and get out.
Now you say that to trash,

293
00:20:04.651 --> 00:20:08.880
but Trisha push back on you just,
well you thought get out,
you fucking get out.

294
00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:14.100
And he's like,
ah.
They laugh and they,
they're kind of e Karen,
Karen.

295
00:20:14.101 --> 00:20:19.020
I mean Karen Goes,
oh,
okay.
And Karen leaves.
Karen is her.

296
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.320
That's,
yeah,
you're right.
That's Karen's is Karen

297
00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:29.460
and I'm like,
get the fuck adding.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This girl is a total Karen.

298
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.240
She has no self respect.
She's making her videos and I'll shit my pants.

299
00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:36.990
So here's the thing,

300
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.870
I think we should go on strike against calm when a neat movement,

301
00:20:42.871 --> 00:20:46.440
the fuck.
Oh,
I'm so proud of you.
What a neat idea lady comes.

302
00:20:46.441 --> 00:20:50.320
She's so of herself for coming up with that.
So here's the thing,

303
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.910
I think we should go on strike against,
uh,
come strike.

304
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.530
And we as in what all women,

305
00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:01.010
she's talking out on behalf of all the women.
Am I right ladies?

306
00:21:01.011 --> 00:21:02.140
So really she's rallying,

307
00:21:02.141 --> 00:21:06.310
this applies the only people that are going to stand with her or like high

308
00:21:06.311 --> 00:21:11.170
school,
college girls,
you know,
because this is not an issue for grown for women.

309
00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:11.460
This is,

310
00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:15.010
this is like the age where he's still read Cosmopolitan magazine and you're

311
00:21:15.011 --> 00:21:17.490
talking about doing the camaraderie and stuff like that.
Yeah.

312
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:22.180
When you're a grown ass woman,
you know,
care about shower.
Yay.
Yay Fam.
Blood.

313
00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:24.430
I from now on,

314
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:29.380
I'm only going and she's 12 calm of a man or put on my body to come have a man

315
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:33.760
who's willing to touch it or kiss me afterward.
No,
she do shit dummy.

316
00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.340
By the way.

317
00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.490
He needs to raise her fucking standard to make it clear for people not sitting

318
00:21:38.491 --> 00:21:43.300
in this,
she's not,
you know,
a teen or 20 that this lady was like,
what do you,

319
00:21:43.301 --> 00:21:47.970
what would you guess?
Mid Forties at best at best you.
She's right.

320
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:51.670
She's newly divorced and she's like discovering the world of young

321
00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:58.210
guys.
It comes through to touch this com.

322
00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:03.350
I won't either.
I'm so proud of wow.
Brave stance.
Yeah.

323
00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:08.740
Martin Luther King of our era.
Right.
The Rosa parks.
The coming world.

324
00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:13.380
Okay.
That men hate their calm.
It's ridiculous.
Oh.

325
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:18.040
And um,
they got to just love their calm before I'm going to like it.

326
00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.660
Oh Wow.
Wow.

327
00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:23.710
This is like all those Instagram things where it's like,
man,

328
00:22:23.711 --> 00:22:28.380
you got to love yourself first.
It's a lot of those sophisticated,
this lady.

329
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:32.920
I mean,
look at the artwork here.
I said she plays obviously,

330
00:22:32.921 --> 00:22:36.790
I mean there's Bach,
Beethoven,
another,
yeah.
The bike.

331
00:22:36.791 --> 00:22:41.130
She probably is active and just sophisticated lady.
And she said,

332
00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:49.060
you dummy.
Don't know.
It's a stupid cause there's,

333
00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.640
there's other things happening in the world in case you hadn't noticed.

334
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:55.690
I know she's worried about her fucking come strike right now.
I'm strike,

335
00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:03.130
don't take ice.
Said,
well then don't date those guys.
I know.

336
00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:07.690
It's so weird.
Date.
Someone else,
Karen,
she's,

337
00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:13.030
she's,
she's dating bodies and she's upset about it then don't they?

338
00:23:13.031 --> 00:23:14.470
Bobbies don't they Bobby?

339
00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.660
There's all kinds of other shit you can do besides Bobby.

340
00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:19.660
Grow up a little bit.

341
00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:25.200
Speaking of come the 50 shades of gray movie.

342
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:30.580
We were scrolling through the films,
the Itunes,
movies,
God,
and we were like,

343
00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:33.010
cause we were,
I'm going to watch it eventually.

344
00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.230
We should make a point about this for his first,
you know,

345
00:23:35.231 --> 00:23:39.700
obviously that book first came out and it was a worldwide phenomenon,
right?

346
00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:43.060
Every woman bought this book in the world.
It felt like,

347
00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:47.490
and then there was such anticipation about the casting of the original,
right?

348
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.030
Saying,
right,
right.
The buildup and then,
Oh my God,
the movie is coming out.

349
00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:56.060
People thought this is going to be on par with the dramatic following and the,

350
00:23:58.171 --> 00:24:01.400
you know,
the excitement around that book and that movie I saw,
I was like,

351
00:24:01.401 --> 00:24:03.020
you know what?
This book is such a hit.

352
00:24:03.021 --> 00:24:07.460
I didn't read the book but I'll see this movie.
Of course it was a pile of shit.

353
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:10.850
Terrible,
terrible mood.
Well I'll tell you a little secret cause I read the book.

354
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:15.530
To me the book is a pile of shit to really,
yeah.
It was like,

355
00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:20.870
you know s and m light.
I did an episode about,
about the whole thing on that.

356
00:24:20.871 --> 00:24:23.900
See Pro the first movie in the book.
Okay.
So if you want to,
let's do it.

357
00:24:23.901 --> 00:24:27.950
It's in the back catalog somewhere.
But I,
it's not even s and m.

358
00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:31.250
It's like it's an,
it's childish like their sexuality,

359
00:24:31.251 --> 00:24:35.330
the girls a virgin in the book and that's her first and then the movie too and

360
00:24:35.331 --> 00:24:38.840
it's her first time having sex with him and she has like five orgasms.

361
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.450
I'm like shit like that.
We are like,
okay.

362
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.850
The first time you had sex she had five orgasms here.
Right.
And like it's naive.

363
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:48.680
I don't know.
Apparently it just seems it's very childish.

364
00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:53.300
The whole fantasy of being rescued by this guy.
My cousin loves it,

365
00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:57.370
loves it.
Some women.
This is really,
this is in their wheelhouse.

366
00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:00.980
It's the strong man who does everything for you.
It takes care of you.

367
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.430
Maybe that's,
that's part of it.
I don't know.
Who knows man.
I Dunno.

368
00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.250
I just remember that the,
here's my criticism of that movie.

369
00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:12.170
It was just so boring and the story was so lame.
I mean,
nothing happened.
Yeah,

370
00:25:12.171 --> 00:25:16.130
there was the,
the stakes weren't there and just you could see that like,
yeah,

371
00:25:16.131 --> 00:25:21.131
this young impressionable girl and the successful good looking guy and you're

372
00:25:22.581 --> 00:25:27.560
like,
okay.
And then when he would kind of play with her,
it wasn't,

373
00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:32.450
you didn't go like,
Oh shit.
Like,
oh,
that's crazy.
She's getting whipped again.

374
00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.340
And then,
um,
the whole thing was like,

375
00:25:34.341 --> 00:25:37.310
will she or won't she sign his s and m contract?

376
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:42.190
And then she does the end.
He was like,
wow.
Fucking deal.

377
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.820
Second part.
And just the trailer.
No sense.

378
00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:50.870
It makes no sense.
It looks like they cut together some of their favorite shots.

379
00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:54.230
She's beautiful.
That girls really particularly good looking people,

380
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:59.150
but it's the same song.
They just redid a gammy leg is so crazy right now.

381
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:04.280
And then it makes no sense.
And then the rating for rotten tomatoes,

382
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:09.310
it got a nine a 9% which is fucking,

383
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.640
it's bad.
Your vin diesel movie,
Vin Diesel,

384
00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:18.080
I think scored a 7% right.
Not a lot of single digit.
Not a lot.
I mean,

385
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:21.920
you see them,
you know,
teens means your garbage.
And again,

386
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:26.660
you can disagree with obviously a bunch of critics,
but when that many say it's,

387
00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:30.980
it's,
it's a Turd.
Yeah.
It's pretty bad.
Well,
a single digit single digit,

388
00:26:30.981 --> 00:26:35.000
really 90% people that saw that movie and we reviewed it,
we were like,

389
00:26:35.001 --> 00:26:36.080
this sucks.
Yeah.

390
00:26:36.081 --> 00:26:40.880
It's too bad because it was hugely successful franchise.
Yeah.
Well,

391
00:26:40.881 --> 00:26:44.070
the book,
you know,
I was one of the books,
I'm just funny.
I said I couldn't do

392
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:48.090
<v 0>it.
Yeah.
I don't know man.
It's definitely a card one.
The book,</v>

393
00:26:48.091 --> 00:26:50.720
it's really just sex scene,
sex scene,
sexy.

394
00:26:50.721 --> 00:26:55.530
And he's chasing after her sex xx,
you know,
but like s and m like,
oh,

395
00:26:55.531 --> 00:27:00.180
but it's not even SNM.
No.
From what I understand about that community,
uh,

396
00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.690
that,
that is like s and m light.
Oh my,
it's like housewife.

397
00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.350
Snm Blindfolding yes.
Super lame.

398
00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:09.820
Oh yeah.

399
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:14.750
It was like when you watch those lame ass Skinemax movies,

400
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:19.830
totally.
100%.
And they're humping like super fast and they're like,

401
00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:23.870
oh,
they're like porno girls doing softcore.

402
00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:28.860
So they're terrible actors.
Yeah.
And then that's,
it's,
it's terrible.

403
00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:33.480
He's terrible.
There's all good one though.
Yeah.
We saw a nocturnal animals.

404
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:36.690
Nocturnally missions.
Yeah.
Internal emissions.
How's great.

405
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:40.060
Tom Ford directed the designer.
The,

406
00:27:40.061 --> 00:27:44.040
the famous designer who knew I had no idea that guy was making movies.
Well,

407
00:27:44.041 --> 00:27:47.120
he did a single man,
which was a really good mood,
I think.

408
00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.480
So it's really good movie.
You ever saw a single man?
I don't remember.

409
00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:55.650
I think you did Julianne Moore and remember,
I like her.
Yeah,

410
00:27:55.710 --> 00:28:00.000
it's really good.
Okay.
This was a man.
I was more impressed that he wrote this.

411
00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.110
That's astounding.

412
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:06.110
It was such a great script and stories and Jake Jolen Cox in it who's just a

413
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:11.870
horribly unattractive and uh,
Amy Amy Adams apples and I like her.

414
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:16.950
She's really good.
Yeah,
that's a really good high recommendation on that one.

415
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:21.660
I mean,
it's entertaining.
You know,
it's a suspenseful.
I liked it.

416
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:25.350
I liked it.
And the account and we launched that last week.

417
00:28:25.351 --> 00:28:29.640
We forgot to mention that one.
Yeah.
That was good to the accountant.
Yeah.

418
00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:33.930
That was pretty interesting.
Guy was like Asperger.
Yeah,
yeah.
He had Asperger's.

419
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.610
Autism.
Yeah.
Um,

420
00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:41.560
yeah.
Well,
Asperger is a form of autism.
Yeah.

421
00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:47.910
Like a more mild,
you know,
on the scale.
Yeah.
Right.

422
00:28:47.911 --> 00:28:52.650
Like they're,
they're so socially somewhat functional.
Right?
Yeah.

423
00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:55.920
Yeah.
Just like not there.
They're not as good Asperger's,

424
00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:00.030
not as good as picking up on social cues.
If somebody,
let's say not on the,
uh,

425
00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:05.580
you know,
the spectrum,
but um,
compared to somebody with like,

426
00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.730
yeah,
strong.
I think there's a few comics,

427
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.300
Asperger's that we've known over the years hold for sure.
Yeah,
for sure.

428
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:17.940
Absolutely.
Well,
yeah.
Um,
would you ever date your mom?
I would date.

429
00:29:17.941 --> 00:29:20.670
My mom is so horrible that I don't get to,
uh,

430
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.370
enjoy all these.

431
00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:27.110
I don't get to play my drops today because of that fucking technique.
Oh,

432
00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:30.540
that's fine.
I play that said,
we don't have any drops today.
We do have some,

433
00:29:30.541 --> 00:29:35.250
but I don't have that one.
I mean Sirius Xm.
God,

434
00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.140
we live inside studio G.

435
00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:41.980
We're waiting for Facebook now to catch up the studio to dude,
can I tell you

436
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.520
<v 4>saying,
speaking of Asperger's,
yeah.</v>

437
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:48.280
I would not be surprised if Garth is on the spectrum.
Yes.
Why?

438
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:52.600
This is why.
This is what I haven't been able to put my finger on.
That's wrong.

439
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:57.430
That's off about him.
If you watch how he talks and how he is,

440
00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.930
he is not emotionally connected to anything he says it's,

441
00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:04.570
it's all an effect.
I'm telling you.
Yeah.
I remember when he was,

442
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:06.130
we watched a video of him with the birthday cake.

443
00:30:06.131 --> 00:30:09.030
I don't know if we're going to be seeing that.
Right.
Well,

444
00:30:09.031 --> 00:30:10.180
we'll watch it just watches.

445
00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:13.480
There's not a genuine emotional connectedness to him.

446
00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:16.990
Even when he was being interviewed by was a Barbara Walters and he was like,

447
00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.330
it's just like snacks.
It was very,

448
00:30:19.331 --> 00:30:21.910
it seemed rehearsed like this is what people say.

449
00:30:21.911 --> 00:30:25.420
This is a shocking thing that people say,
oh,
I wouldn't be surprised,

450
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:28.840
but he seems real phony Bologna.
He has.

451
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:32.290
There's a room here that they've called inside studio g.

452
00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:38.020
He's such a Dad Boehner.
He's like the most famous dad boner for sure.

453
00:30:38.021 --> 00:30:38.854
That there is,

454
00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:43.380
he's like the chairman Jesse and empires.

455
00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:48.170
And then over here cog love one another.
Oh boy.

456
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:52.870
Boy who is a big phony.
See what I'm saying?
No,

457
00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.560
it's like he checks off all the boxes of what it is to be a successful country

458
00:30:56.561 --> 00:30:59.290
star.
Love it.
I love everybody.
I love my fans.

459
00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:03.830
Thank you for joining me is bullshit.
Yeah.

460
00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:04.960
That's kind of bullshit.

461
00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:10.300
Welcomed inside studio g first here and a,
I like it that way.

462
00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:15.010
Really cool.
Yeah,
but that's why we think he's funny.

463
00:31:15.011 --> 00:31:18.400
I think he's kind of autistic and I wouldn't be surprised when we think he's

464
00:31:18.401 --> 00:31:21.250
funny because he's autistic because there's something not connecting.

465
00:31:21.251 --> 00:31:25.600
I'm saying he's weird.
That's well,
yeah,
let's leave it up on some things.

466
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:29.800
Definitely weird.
Yeah,
but he's not autistic.
I think something's doing.

467
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:31.950
Something's weird about them for sure.
Uh,

468
00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:37.140
like a little uncomfortable as it was almost like this is a bad idea or poorly

469
00:31:39.101 --> 00:31:43.360
executed.
Maybe it is.
All his social media stuff is poorly executed.

470
00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.990
It's just like if you told your dad social media,

471
00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:51.820
that's why it's funny because he doesn't,
he's uncomfortable almost doing it.

472
00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:55.780
Well,
it's too contrived for social media.
You've gotta be way looser,
Bro.

473
00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:59.230
Like he doesn't need to be a studio g.
Even this room,

474
00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:03.700
it doesn't feel like a studio because there's just three things hang in and a

475
00:32:03.701 --> 00:32:08.530
desk.
But like in a small child's dust that he's sitting on with nothing on it.

476
00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.620
So it feels like they just put stuff in a room and they were like this studio g

477
00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:16.480
it is.
I got,
he's annoyed.

478
00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:22.550
Is that supposed to supposed to [inaudible] birthday.

479
00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:32.740
So that's his lady.
She comes in with a birthday cake.
She's looking fat.

480
00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:38.040
His,
his woman.
Yes,
she was.
That's his woman.
Yeah.
Dude,

481
00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:40.790
she's gained some weight.
Yeah,
no.
Well,

482
00:32:40.791 --> 00:32:45.290
you know Bert loss and stuff and someone else got to put it on inside out
happen.

483
00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:49.910
So weight loss go.
Yeah,
Dude.
She doesn't look capitated right there.
Yeah.

484
00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:53.470
What staring up like,
yeah.
When the knock happen,
he was like,
Oh,

485
00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:58.190
is that supposed to happen?
He didn't like,
is that supposed to happen?

486
00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:03.080
Ah,
Ooh.
That's,
see that's the real guy.
Yeah.
That,
that's the guy.

487
00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:05.660
Yeah.
He doesn't want his fans to say yep.

488
00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:11.060
That's the guy who if you're waiting on him,
yeah.
And you bring the wrong yeah.

489
00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:15.020
Dish.
That's the real guy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's Garth.

490
00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:19.100
He being the wrong thing at the table is full beards.
It doesn't work on it.

491
00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:22.880
It looks great.
Actually.
I like,
I mean,
I liked beards.
I like you.
So,
yeah,

492
00:33:22.881 --> 00:33:27.110
that's true.
She does.
Our corn is a fantastic
man.

493
00:33:27.111 --> 00:33:30.430
When you're married to the bomb,
this is what she like.
Get on your year of birth.

494
00:33:30.431 --> 00:33:35.030
New in your marriage.
Gorgeous cake.
Fat Check we talking about.

Is that her?
Is that her name?
Trish.
Trish,
yeah.
Trish was so cute.
Trish.

496
00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:43.040
Trish got Husky?
No,

she definitely got bigger.
Yeah.

497
00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:47.550
That's a good life man.
You know,

Shit.

Awesome job.
Okay.

499
00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:57.290
Uh,
inside studio g,
is that supposed to happen?

500
00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:02.090
Oh,
Hey,

You have a mentor that would ask Garth sweetness.

501
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:03.703

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:09.810
so he calls them an ask Garth and then he doesn't know sweetness to dad move.

You have a mentor that would ask Garth sweetness.
Okay.

505
00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:24.370
Yeah.
He does not want to be doing this.
No.

508
00:34:33.581 --> 00:34:34.414
right time.

509
00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:36.413
<v 8>Watch this.</v>

510
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:40.490
<v 7>Just the instant cuts,
right?</v>

511
00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.120
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

512
00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:45.270
<v 7>He's the guy that brings them to their feet.
There it is.</v>

513
00:34:45.271 --> 00:34:48.240
See what happens when he does that.
He's great at it.

514
00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:51.580
<v 4>Yeah.
Okay,</v>

515
00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:55.480
<v 9>cool.
Jesse says,
cool.
Gee,</v>

516
00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:58.400
we just won't be sponsoring more that we won't be talking about one of the

517
00:34:58.401 --> 00:35:01.880
positions.
Jesse says,
well,
what is behind the scenes stuff?

518
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.460
It's pretty cool.
Yeah,
it is cool.
What's that?
We're going to have any insight.

519
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:08.660
Studio g we just won't be sponsoring more of that.

520
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:11.490
We won't be talking about one of the positions says,
well,

521
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:14.870
love all of this behind the scenes stuff.
Thank you.
It's pretty cool,

522
00:35:14.871 --> 00:35:17.750
man and [inaudible] and what I,
what I find out,
so let's see.

523
00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:22.250
It's cool to start texting me or telling me stories about how during the show

524
00:35:22.251 --> 00:35:23.570
they'll start to watch the crew,

525
00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:27.930
which is cool too because the crew is as much part of our show as again as a

526
00:35:27.931 --> 00:35:29.960
drummer.
The guitar player.
Yeah,
it was Garth Brooks.

527
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:33.880
<v 4>Nice.
I'm Northbrook says I'm not special.
I love this phony.</v>

528
00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.550
The third person is the ultimate places.
Yeah,

529
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:39.660
it's the crew is just as important as the drummer,
the guitar player,

530
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:43.850
even as Garth Brooks is.
So everyone's important.
That guy,

531
00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:44.791
what I find out,

532
00:35:44.791 --> 00:35:49.140
so as people start texting me or telling me stories about how during the show

533
00:35:49.141 --> 00:35:50.430
they'll start to watch the crew,

534
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:54.840
which is cool because the crew is as much part of our show as again as the

535
00:35:54.841 --> 00:35:59.430
drummer,
the guitar player,
this Garth Brooks is this crew,
Garth Brooks as gee.

536
00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:00.780
Wow.

537
00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:05.160
As important as GE is such another country music thing of like I have,

538
00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:09.870
everybody's just equal.
I'm just as important as the grips.
Like some,

539
00:36:09.871 --> 00:36:14.010
some of them are,
not that they're not important,
but one of you guys,

540
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:17.460
if one of you doesn't show up for the night,
kind of ruins the whole thing.

541
00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:21.810
You know what?
I'm happy birthday.
So we missed that.

542
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:23.400
That's what he said to Jake.

543
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:28.670
He says he's doing himself happy birthday to g baby birthday.

544
00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:35.850
So cool buddy.
Sweetness,
sweetness,

545
00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:42.020
sweetness.
Such an old dad.
It's pretty cool man.
And then it's,

546
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:42.863
it's neat.

547
00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:50.420
Such dad boner.
He's,
he,
he is the greatest.
He's an exemplary dad.
Boner now.

548
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:54.610
And you know,
he's probably a pretty good dad.
You know,
he's faking that too.

549
00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:59.900
I feel like you have contempt for him that I had just,

550
00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:04.320
there's something about this guy that doesn't,
it doesn't rub me the right way.

551
00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:07.950
I just think that we're going to find out in a few years some dark shit.
Oh,

552
00:37:07.951 --> 00:37:12.560
it's definitely some dark shit.
He's a little too Cosby,
you know,
like,
you know,

553
00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:16.050
orchestrated and clean and everything's like,
isn't this neat?
Great.

554
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.060
That's what I'm talking about.
I know.

555
00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:23.010
Especially like a famous guy who's got access to tons of puss and whatever he

556
00:37:23.011 --> 00:37:25.890
wants.
Yeah.
Gimme a fucking break,
you know,

557
00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:30.060
and I know he's got demons,
Howard guy.
Yeah,
he's a weird dude.

558
00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:34.800
We're going to know about that stuff later.
Um,
do you see the spider in the sink?

559
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.760
You saw that this,

560
00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:43.060
this is a couple that they're on vacation I think during mom's Trillia.
Yup.

561
00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:46.410
And uh,
they find a big,
so there's some big ass spiders there.

562
00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.140
Lots of critters and mom's Australia and the,
uh,

563
00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:56.393
recording

564
00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.930
so big.
It's huge.

565
00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:12.090
So she's,
she's really scared.
The recording keeps pretty,

566
00:38:12.091 --> 00:38:16.230
you know,
scared too.
But so he's got the,
uh,
they're getting a spray out,
you know,

567
00:38:16.231 --> 00:38:19.080
they're going to try to just dose it.
Dowsett

568
00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:26.640
I love the subtitle.

569
00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:36.100
The subtitle is a genius.
I said,
Vicky,
maybe they there,
but she's

570
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.430
<v 0>obviously,
she's not Australia.
She's,
you know,
well,
she has a,</v>

571
00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:42.000
she has an Australian accent,
which is so fascinating.
Right,
right.

572
00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:44.440
So she's learned English.
She learned English in Australia.
Right.

573
00:38:44.441 --> 00:38:49.390
But she's not a native Australian.
Right.
Was there.

574
00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:53.080
Um,
so then she gears up and they line them up here.

575
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:56.980
It's funny to hear someone with that accent.
There she goes.

576
00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:04.970
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

577
00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:13.570
<v 0>now she kind of dropped a big word there.
She sure did.
Never heard.</v>

578
00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:16.870
I've never heard a Chinese Australian dropped that on a spider.

579
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.750
<v 4>That's what I'm saying that,
well that's why were at your mom's House special.</v>

580
00:39:19.751 --> 00:39:20.300
Special.

581
00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:21.133
<v 10>Yeah.</v>

582
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:29.570
<v 4>I've done the,
the lead up to something like that where you just scream</v>

583
00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:34.100
for any of that.
You dropped the and Bama.
I didn't drop it in bond on it,

584
00:39:34.101 --> 00:39:35.440
but I dropped a,
you know,
a lot of

585
00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.870
<v 8>[inaudible].</v>

586
00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:43.130
<v 0>That's kind of like running into battle.
That's moderate,
you know.
Right.</v>

587
00:39:43.131 --> 00:39:46.280
The spider that's domestic.
It's domestic battle.
Right.

588
00:39:46.281 --> 00:39:49.650
That's a brain farm moment.
Right,
right.
Yeah,
totally.
It was like,
oh my God.

589
00:39:49.651 --> 00:39:54.560
Like you just go for it.
Yeah.
She was terrified.
I was scared.

590
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:56.223
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

591
00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:59.190
<v 4>Dad,
do you have the biggest bugs,
man?</v>

592
00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:04.640
I remember back during road rules.
Oh my God.
So do I,
sorry,
sorry.

593
00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:06.970
So we used to stay in youth hostels.
That's a secret.

594
00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:10.270
You never really slept in the Winnebago.
We would check into youth hostels.

595
00:40:10.271 --> 00:40:13.720
Everybody's just drill on each other and those houses,
no,
no,
actually no,

596
00:40:13.721 --> 00:40:17.140
we didn't.
Nobody slept each other on my cast.
So wow.
The Lights,

597
00:40:17.141 --> 00:40:20.500
the crew lights would be on in our bedroom.
We'd all sleep in the same room.

598
00:40:20.501 --> 00:40:23.920
In bunk beds.
Yeah.
And the lights will be on,

599
00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:26.560
so all the bugs would be attracted to the lights.

600
00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:30.190
So when the crew would leave at night and they turn lights out,

601
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.010
there would be a layer of bugs on the ceiling,

602
00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:37.340
like a layer of huge moths and I would always get the top,
the top bunk,

603
00:40:37.341 --> 00:40:42.070
because I like top bunk and the bugs would just fall on me all night and I would

604
00:40:42.071 --> 00:40:46.600
put the sheet over my head and just look.
I'd feel them falling on me.

605
00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:49.330
It was so gnarly.
Australia is just so gnarly.

606
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.180
<v 10>Okay.</v>

607
00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:55.180
<v 4>That's your bugs are a keychain.
Nothing to kill him.</v>

608
00:40:55.181 --> 00:41:00.010
Why did they just had to fall on me and go away?
It was horrible.
I don't like,

609
00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:03.790
I really don't like that.
I really know.
That's not cool or neat.
No.

610
00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:08.500
<v 0>One time I was in Lima and a fucking sewer rat.</v>

611
00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:09.713
The house.

612
00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.000
<v 10>Ooh.</v>

613
00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:13.800
<v 0>And they had a body guard,
like security guy that worked there.</v>

614
00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:17.080
He beat it with a stick and killed it.
Damn.

615
00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:22.290
This big are fine with a stick.
Yeah.
He got like a mop or something,

616
00:41:22.291 --> 00:41:26.040
just like club the shit out of it.
How big are they?
It was massive.

617
00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:29.910
It was a massive thing.
As big as Betsy.
It looked like,
I mean,
no,

618
00:41:29.911 --> 00:41:33.980
not quite that big,
but it was pretty big.
Yeah.
Dude and Cuba when

619
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:38.420
<v 4>I did,
um,
that naval show [inaudible] they have those,
uh,
what are those called?</v>

620
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:43.250
And Rats.
Oh yeah,
they look like,
yeah,
like that.
Those are nasty.

621
00:41:43.251 --> 00:41:47.300
I remember you came back with all those videos of them.
Ah,
yeah.

622
00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:49.450
And they were just everywhere.
Yeah.

623
00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:53.030
They tried to kill them all the time cause they overpopulate so much.

624
00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:56.750
Oh there's a guy on base who drives around with a 22 and he's just supposed to

625
00:41:56.751 --> 00:42:00.470
shoot everyone and that doesn't even put a dent in the problem.

626
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:05.120
Like he'll kill 20,
30,
40 at a time,
you know,
and they're like,

627
00:42:05.121 --> 00:42:08.570
it doesn't even put a dent in our problem with kind of a fun job though,

628
00:42:08.571 --> 00:42:11.960
when you think about that was a blast.
Yeah.
If you have a no ambition,

629
00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:16.880
what a great job.
I mean,
if you're stuck on an island and working on base,

630
00:42:16.881 --> 00:42:20.930
that's kind of the the truck and drive around and shoot these things like

631
00:42:20.931 --> 00:42:21.980
fucking awesome.

632
00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:25.790
Did you and your bro just shooting these disgusting creatures that are

633
00:42:25.791 --> 00:42:30.170
overpopulated?
That probably makes it easier because they don't know.
Not Cute.

634
00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:35.660
Yeah,
I do.
Yeah.
Ah,
I got to be so nasty.
Cuba.

635
00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.480
There is some island.

636
00:42:38.481 --> 00:42:42.860
I did a Gig on some military base here in California and they,

637
00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:47.840
they were overcome with a,
was it raccoons?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Raccoons just,

638
00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:52.800
Oh,
so many dude.
And you see these so many.
These are,

639
00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:55.610
we could feed them.
They come right up to you.
They didn't give a fuck.

640
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:59.330
You see these fuckers?
They're big man.

641
00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:04.250
Oh Damn Dude.
That is as big as our dogs all over the island,
man.
All over.

642
00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.910
Look at this motherfucker drinking,
drinking those guys.
Bottle dude.
Yeah,

643
00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:11.390
so I guess,
you know,
maybe it's just a fear because they're new.

644
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:14.170
Maybe they're sweeter.
I know that they eat,
they're not like 'em

645
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:19.400
<v 0>are sewer rats,
they just chew on but eat vegetation there.
Oh,
okay.
You know,</v>

646
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.280
but fuck man,
when you saw the first time I saw one,

647
00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:25.040
I think I've told this story before,
uh,

648
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:29.870
we pulled up to our first show and the lights from the van,

649
00:43:29.871 --> 00:43:32.180
we're highlighting them and they weren't,
you know,
skittish.

650
00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:35.510
They're just over there eating,
but they're pretty close.
So the guy was like,

651
00:43:35.511 --> 00:43:37.010
you can go take a,
you know,
you can look at them.

652
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:42.370
So we all get out of the van and we start to walk over slowly and literally as

653
00:43:43.401 --> 00:43:45.800
we get,
uh,
I don't know,

654
00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:50.420
maybe five feet,
um,
from it,
you know,

655
00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:53.150
you kind of squat a little more cause you're really taking in that you're seeing

656
00:43:53.151 --> 00:43:55.790
it in person.
And as I do that,

657
00:43:55.791 --> 00:43:58.370
as I leaned forward to get like a kind of good glimpse of it,

658
00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:03.820
one of the other guys on the show ran his two fingers up my back.

659
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.770
<v 4>Ah,
and I let,</v>

660
00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:07.433
<v 8>yes,</v>

661
00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:15.450
<v 0>I lit up like a high pitched scream that they asked me if I was joking.</v>

662
00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:19.510
You know,
they're like,
where are you doing a bit?
But that's how

663
00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:23.550
<v 4>gross.
All right,
cause I had that that moment.
Yeah,
I know.</v>

664
00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:27.620
Like the spider and they spook you.
It spooked,
man.
Let the record show.

665
00:44:27.621 --> 00:44:30.530
By the way,
I have one,
two,
three containers of water.

666
00:44:30.531 --> 00:44:32.010
How many do everyone's over this

667
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.680
<v 0>right now?
How many do you have over it?
How many do you have?
Curious.</v>

668
00:44:35.681 --> 00:44:39.820
You have a disgusting soda and coffee.
Only dehydrating elements.

669
00:44:39.821 --> 00:44:44.440
No hydration,
no dehydration.
Because this is water.
No sugar,

670
00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:48.430
no artificial sweetener,
no caffeine.
Okay,
but it's like sugar water.

671
00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:52.990
It's not sugar.
Fake sugar water.
It's Z via whatever we're switching.

672
00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:56.080
The House has switched over from liquid to Zv.
Yeah.

673
00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:59.560
I hate this because I don't like Zevia.
I don't like it.

674
00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:03.540
It doesn't taste good.
I liked the clock right now I hire,

675
00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:08.080
we also had a revelation about liquid.
What it makes our stomachs hurt,

676
00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:12.300
couple of them,
and we keep drinking them and I keep drinking it them.

677
00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:15.700
You're done.
Totally.
I'm not into them.
You're fully CVO.
Now,

678
00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:18.840
here's the fun thing about Cvi.
If you,
if you'll allow me.
Okay.
Here's what I,

679
00:45:18.841 --> 00:45:21.400
here's why I'm in is eve.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I've gone pretty,

680
00:45:21.401 --> 00:45:24.370
you'd admit pretty hardcore with my no sugar into,
yeah.
Yeah.

681
00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:28.360
I don't fuck with sugar at all.
Right.
Yeah.
You know,
an exception here or there,

682
00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:31.210
but my day to day is no sugar.

683
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:36.400
Zevia is like Keto friendly sweetener.
Right?
Yeah.
Other words,

684
00:45:36.401 --> 00:45:41.050
there's some sweeteners are like fake sweeteners that have the same effect on

685
00:45:41.051 --> 00:45:44.650
your body that sugar does.
Right,
right.
This does not,
so it's a,

686
00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:47.290
it's kind of an indulgence.
It makes you feel like,

687
00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:52.090
like I'm a drink drinking us doing a bad girl treat and that therefore it's more

688
00:45:52.091 --> 00:45:55.840
enjoyable to me.
I understand.
I understand the logic.
Yeah.
However,

689
00:45:55.841 --> 00:45:59.440
it tastes like shit.
It tastes like just like a soda to me.

690
00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:00.340
It's just like the gays,

691
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:05.170
but to me it makes me thirsty year and it makes my stomach feel weird.

692
00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:08.950
Both the Quad Moz via too.
Why don't you marry your mound and then see you?

693
00:46:08.951 --> 00:46:13.290
Why don't you,
why don't you,
oh,
awesome.
Awesome.
Awesome.

694
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:18.550
Awesome.
Um,
go ahead.
See if this is here.
I'm trying to see if this is,
uh,

695
00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:21.340
I wanna I wanna find something.
Oh man,

696
00:46:21.341 --> 00:46:25.210
that's what sucks about having that computer fucked is that there's been any the

697
00:46:25.211 --> 00:46:29.860
f word.
I know.
Let me see if this is,
yeah,

698
00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:33.190
this song.
We would have so many killer songs lately.
Yeah.

699
00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:38.220
But you know how sometimes from moment to moment you get one stuck in your head?

700
00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:41.830
Yeah.
The one that's been in my head,

701
00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:46.810
like I'm hearing it as I'm falling asleep is just like the gays by DJ boy
butter.

702
00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:49.940
That's what I played on the in bed last night.
It's just like,

703
00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:52.100
it's just like good.
Just like the gay

704
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:57.270
<v 11>here.
My son.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
I'm your mom.
You're my son.</v>

705
00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:03.540
I'm your mom.
Ask when you
get your mom.

706
00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:11.250
Yes.
I would hear my son.
I'm your mom.

707
00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:16.320
You could like the gate,
like the gate.

708
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:19.350
I looked at her and she looked at me

709
00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:27.860
cause like the gauge
once the,
he calls me mom.

710
00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:31.480
What I mean?
Hold consenting.
Adults

711
00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:36.060
ask and when you ask them,

712
00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:41.080
when I looked at her and she looked at me and you're my son,

713
00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:44.350
I'm your mom.
Just like the gate,

714
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:49.960
the gate.
I cannot get enough.
It's amazing.

715
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:57.240
You just like the gays.
Amazing.

716
00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:00.370
<v 4>I think you,
you would like goth music,</v>

717
00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:06.830
whatever music.
It sounds like goth music.
Well you know,
I liked that.

718
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:10.540
Trancey kind of Susie and the banshees.
You liked the kaleidoscope album.
You,

719
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:14.710
you've listened to that one.
Good tones on tail fan.
You love tones on tail.
Yeah.

720
00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:16.420
Bauhaus.
Um,

721
00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:20.920
I've been thinking of eye shadow dolls with my hands.

722
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.410
My ass.
I think that's Ali,
right?
Yeah.

723
00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:28.510
Ali's DMZs or that guy's been cranking out the heads on this show.

724
00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:32.950
Which one is that?
And then,
then he'd do the tape song as well.
Was that him?

725
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:34.270
He's on a bunch of the fart.

726
00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:37.720
<v 12>Hey.
Hi.
How are you?
What's your name?
What's Your Pronoun?</v>

727
00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:43.030
<v 4>We can't play that one.
Yeah,
for illegal.</v>

728
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:49.790
<v 12>Just the one.
Yeah.
This is it.
I love it.
Oh yeah,</v>

729
00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:50.633
this is really great.

730
00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:57.450
Do blippy plastic.

731
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:09.520
I shot.
This is sounds like

732
00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:12.333
that I like,

733
00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:32.873
<v 5>Alrighty.</v>

734
00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:37.840
<v 12>I shadow dom</v>

735
00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:10.713
genius

736
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:18.650
coming out of your mom's house.
We

737
00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:23.650
<v 4>had a crazy playlist playing when people were filing in for the shows.</v>

738
00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:28.060
Enough People um,
push before

739
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:28.800
<v 0>it where</v>

740
00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:33.120
<v 4>I am going to put together a playlist.
Right.
So we're doing it finally.
Yeah.</v>

741
00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:35.880
Sorry.
Um,
about,
yes,
I will get on that.

742
00:50:35.881 --> 00:50:39.240
I promise you give me just like a week or so to figure it out.

743
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:43.890
Can you play the beat box?
Dad Glass.
Holy Shit.
That one was amazed.

744
00:50:43.891 --> 00:50:47.340
We did this at the live show and I just can't stop thinking about how much I

745
00:50:47.341 --> 00:50:49.950
like it.
I wanted to hear it again.
Yeah,
that was amazing.

746
00:50:49.951 --> 00:50:52.450
What happened was a guy took the

747
00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:57.380
<v 0>um,
the,
the super,
the Super Hunter Dad,
you know this guy,</v>

748
00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:01.910
this glass and guy were glass and just glass
glass and Dad.

749
00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:06.140
And when that guy first killed that Moose,
he made that

750
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:10.160
<v 4>crazy noise,
right?
Yeah.</v>

751
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:14.360
Like I like using studios,
studio g sound.

752
00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:17.390
That's what they say to play when they open up studio g

753
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:20.730
dad sound studio g.

754
00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:25.360
<v 0>So that guy,
the class</v>

755
00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:30.280
a guy made a song,

756
00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:34.630
a beat box song off of his,

757
00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:37.390
um,
off of those noises.

758
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:38.830
<v 4>No,
the room.
Oh my God.
I love it.</v>

759
00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:45.720
<v 0>Where is it?
Where is it?
Uh,
I shattered</v>

760
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:52.100
my hands finger in my ass.
I can't,

761
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:55.070
you can't find a gene.
I just had it and I don't know where it is.

762
00:51:55.071 --> 00:51:59.810
I just put it somewhere.
Um,
is in the early show on late show or is it

763
00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:02.390
song?
Song.

764
00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.930
<v 4>I'll talk while you're doing this.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

765
00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:08.900
I think I just wanted to mention the live show stuff.
Oh,
you know,

766
00:52:08.901 --> 00:52:13.850
in the past we were able to stay afterward and take pictures of people and meet

767
00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:18.460
all the mommies.
But I just want you guys to know like we're not fucking dicks.

768
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:20.150
That's why we're not able to do it.

769
00:52:20.151 --> 00:52:24.450
It's because the way that the shows were stacked,
the seven and the nine gray,

770
00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:27.490
it was seven to nine,
nine 30.

771
00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:30.170
There was no time if we will out there and do all that,

772
00:52:30.171 --> 00:52:33.860
like we have to reset immediately and then by the time the nine o'clock show let

773
00:52:33.861 --> 00:52:34.041
out,

774
00:52:34.041 --> 00:52:36.980
it was already super late and we had to get back to baby jeans and Armani and

775
00:52:36.981 --> 00:52:37.221
stuff.

776
00:52:37.221 --> 00:52:42.221
So just so you guys know or not douchebags we just couldn't do it for time.

777
00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.780
<v 0>There was just no way,
you know,
it's too much.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

778
00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:50.590
I have a search going for it right now,
but I don't know where it is.
Right.

779
00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:54.590
But we'll find it.
We'll find it.
If not today,
then next week.

780
00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:59.570
Um,
here's what I wanted to play for you.
Uh Oh,

well,

781
00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:01.970
I'll close with that.
We have another shit the thing to do then,

782
00:53:01.971 --> 00:53:06.350
but right now is a good time.
Oh,

um,

783
00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.210
<v 13>I'm so excite.</v>

784
00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:17.170
So finally that's deep brow has an official at seat row by cash shirt.

785
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:22.340

It's black because that helps.
Yeah,

Check it out.
Thank you.
That's Ebro podcast.com.

794
00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:57.900
I got some big announcements for my um,
tour that I've been on.

795
00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:02.580
One is that we added another show in DC at the Improv.

796
00:54:02.581 --> 00:54:06.480
We added a late show Sunday,
so that'll be um,

797
00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:11.460
that's available now.
We added a show in Burlington,
Vermont at higher ground.

798
00:54:11.461 --> 00:54:16.380
We added a 7:00 PM show originally.
We had a later show,
um,

799
00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:22.200
Seattle.
We added a show at the Moore theater that's on sale now.
So Seattle,

800
00:54:22.201 --> 00:54:25.590
me rattle.
If you haven't gotten your tickets yet,

801
00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:29.620
you have a chance now for the late show,
uh,

802
00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:34.500
at the Moore theater at all.
That is,
um,
April 14th is that show.
So get on it.

803
00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:39.180
Portland sold out really far in advance and um,

804
00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:44.240
I couldn't add a show the original weekend because the next day is Easter,

805
00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:47.550
so it kind of screwed with that.

806
00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:52.470
So instead I'm coming back to Portland one month later.
Same venue,

807
00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:56.910
Revolution Hall.
And the added show is May 13th,

808
00:54:56.911 --> 00:54:59.310
so don't sleep on those.

809
00:54:59.311 --> 00:55:04.170
If you haven't purchased your Portland tickets,
there's now an opportunity to go,

810
00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:09.660
uh,
May 13th that is also on sale right now.

811
00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:14.190
Um,
so make sure you scoop those up.
I will be,

812
00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:19.290
this weekend is all sold out.
I'm looking forward to it.
Um,
Long Island,

813
00:55:19.291 --> 00:55:23.370
Montclair and Atlantic city next weekend and Canada.

814
00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:28.080
It's all sold out.
And then the weeks after that,
I dunno.

815
00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.750
Look them up.
Thompson [inaudible] dot com slash tour.

816
00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:33.660

I know.

839
00:56:56.940 --> 00:57:01.270
<v 14>Grew along Ross sky,
you don't need to figure your home.
You don't want to,</v>

840
00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:02.500
I got it on your finger.

841
00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:07.860
<v 4>Yeah,
I got it.
I'm fucking ready.
I've been waiting to try these on.
Let's try it.</v>

842
00:57:08.250 --> 00:57:11.130
Which one do you want?
Oh,
take my o g one.

843
00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:15.570
So we had these at the live show.
Yeah.

844
00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:20.370
So we were sitting around at Korean barbecue last week planning the show and we

845
00:57:20.371 --> 00:57:24.840
thought,
wouldn't it be fun to get some pup play masks?
Uh,

846
00:57:24.930 --> 00:57:28.920
how's the audio?
Hold on,
let me help you.

847
00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:33.350
<v 15>I'm boring my fetish,
man.</v>

848
00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:38.380
I'm wearing mine now too.
Yours is a little different,

849
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:43.210
but the same idea.
You know the same idea.

850
00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:47.680
<v 14>What do you think of a burn?
What's your ass smells like?
What'd you call them?</v>

851
00:57:47.681 --> 00:57:48.514
Balls smell like?

852
00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:51.860
<v 4>Well,
what do you think?
Do you like the experience?</v>

853
00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:56.300
<v 15>I understand.
I understand the thrill of the tight laid techs</v>

854
00:57:57.030 --> 00:58:00.000
<v 14>smell what your nose smell like at different times of the day.</v>

855
00:58:00.110 --> 00:58:04.820
<v 4>Good.
What about the smell?
It smells really powerful in the,</v>

856
00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:08.090
that effort,
but I'm working on getting a more keen sense of smell.

857
00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:12.200
<v 14>Nice to different parts of your underwear.</v>

858
00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.850
<v 15>Uh,
feels right.
I think I should take it off.</v>

859
00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:19.460
<v 4>It's horrifying.
Wait,
it's horrible.
Yeah,
no,</v>

860
00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:22.660
it's triers on.
Yeah,
try that.
That's terrible.

861
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:26.950
So Tom's got the original fetish mass for those of you just listening.

862
00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:30.790
These are,
so this is the original black terrifying one.

863
00:58:30.850 --> 00:58:35.380
And then I got another one that's a German shepard with crazy mouth open and

864
00:58:35.381 --> 00:58:39.190
crazy eyes.
And it is terrifying as well.
Yeah,
it's pretty,
it's pretty crazy.

865
00:58:39.191 --> 00:58:41.950
If you saw somebody walk up and this you don't think friendly,

866
00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:45.790
you don't think like,
oh that's pretty,
that's a friendly guy.
This is terrible.

867
00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:47.170
This smells so bad.

868
00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:50.020
<v 15>Yeah.
Oh No.</v>

869
00:58:50.730 --> 00:58:54.440
<v 4>Horrible.
So we had the thing going about,
which was more terrifying and oh yeah.</v>

870
00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:59.460
People I'd be,
we'll go black one because it's the fetish mask right away.

871
00:58:59.461 --> 00:59:04.461
But I still could feel like there's something creepier about the non fetish

872
00:59:05.521 --> 00:59:09.370
mask.
I do.
I don't think so.
About the,
the,
the googly eyes.

873
00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:13.780
Cause you are realize or in that this has fake eyes in it.
That's what,

874
00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:17.900
that's what it is.
The dead eyes.
It's dead.
Fake eyes.
Yeah.

875
00:59:18.490 --> 00:59:21.350
How many walks up in this [inaudible] you don't know what's happening.
Yeah.

876
00:59:21.351 --> 00:59:25.910
But blue band made a good point about the original fetish mask is that there's

877
00:59:25.911 --> 00:59:30.280
no expression.
Oh,
that's
terrible.
Right?

878
00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:35.600
I know,
I got it all.
You're right.
That's way worser.
C.
Yeah.
Wait,

879
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:39.350
try this again.
Do it again again.
Well,
let me see.
I want to see the contrast.

880
00:59:39.590 --> 00:59:44.300
So this is the original fetish pup play.
Oh,
that is just terrifying.

881
00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:48.830
See that's like a rapist or a serial killer.
Like it's,
it's traditionally scary,

882
00:59:48.831 --> 00:59:53.240
but it's like it's telling you it's scary,
right?
That one is misleading.

883
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:57.860
Try that one again please.
Fucking prop show today.

884
00:59:58.030 --> 01:00:02.240
I want to see.
Yeah,
that one could be,

885
01:00:02.241 --> 01:00:05.030
I'm robbing a bank or I'm raping you.
Oh my God.

886
01:00:05.031 --> 01:00:07.500
Your beard is sticking through the mouth holes.
Others,

887
01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:11.120
peers sticking in his mouth.

888
01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:14.160
<v 0>Definitely.
We were terrible.
Do you feel sexy though?</v>

889
01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:18.810
I mean I get that people like some people just like wearing latex,
right?

890
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:22.800
It doesn't personally arouse me,
but I understand why it's a thrill for someone.

891
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:25.070
I do.
I get it.
It's a tactile thing.

892
01:00:25.530 --> 01:00:28.860
But wouldn't it ripped super tight on you if you were to zip it up?

893
01:00:28.861 --> 01:00:32.030
Cause we couldn't zip it over your head.
Yeah.
Cause it would trap your hair.

894
01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:36.630
Doesn't get caught.
Tear.
Your hair gets caught and then you have 10 Vaseline up,

895
01:00:36.631 --> 01:00:39.690
I think.
Yeah,
that would be,
that would not be good,
dude.

896
01:00:39.691 --> 01:00:43.570
I don't like those at all.
I don't enjoy wearing that shit at all.

897
01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:49.470
No,
I'm not.
It's so scary,
right?
No,
it's just not,
it's not my world.

898
01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:55.020
We got,
speaking of Garth,
we got another,
uh,
Dad Boehner here.
Oh,

899
01:00:55.021 --> 01:00:56.220
sweet dad Boehner video.

900
01:00:56.580 --> 01:01:00.660
Cool of a dad who was driving and he saw a funny sign.

901
01:01:01.650 --> 01:01:02.280
<v 7>All right.</v>

902
01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:07.280
So I'm driving home and I'm heading down near the auto mall and I pass this

903
01:01:09.721 --> 01:01:14.250
strip club.
I glanced up at it at the,

904
01:01:14.790 --> 01:01:19.440
I just glanced at it like I'm driving by and something that I saw come across

905
01:01:19.450 --> 01:01:24.450
the school made me stop and want to film this and I was fucking crying.

906
01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:29.110
<v 0>Let's see what it is.
It's so,
so funny.</v>

907
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:33.590
<v 4>Yeah.
And it should be coming up soon.
Oh,
right here.
Okay,</v>

908
01:01:50.410 --> 01:01:51.243
<v 17>man,</v>

909
01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:53.590
<v 0>he quit being a dad.
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

910
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:55.950
That was so funny to him that he wanted to quit battery.

911
01:01:56.050 --> 01:01:58.830
You realize that that's what's out there,
but that's,
yeah.
When you're like,

912
01:01:58.831 --> 01:02:02.870
I wonder if this jokes good enough.
Yeah.
Right,
right.
Okay.
That guy,

913
01:02:02.871 --> 01:02:05.490
I thought gluten free lap dances was the funniest thing he'd ever heard.

914
01:02:05.491 --> 01:02:06.810
Did you hear that?
Yeah.

915
01:02:07.530 --> 01:02:11.370
So the sign is a scroll and it says gluten free lap dances.
Yeah.

916
01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.300
And he hasn't looked over.
I,
I,
I salute you for having a sense of humor.
Yeah.

917
01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:20.130
About it.
It's funny.
Good.
Yeah.
Would you laugh?
No,
but that's

918
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:22.000
<v 4>the thing with Dads,
is it?
Yeah.</v>

919
01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:25.770
They really get tickled by stuff most of us don't.
Like.

920
01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:30.120
I think what it is is like your life gets so mundane as we've discovered being

921
01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:33.780
parents that you just get excited about little stuff because you don't

922
01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:36.840
experience,
the world is mine.
At least I don't like Shit,
man.

923
01:02:36.841 --> 01:02:38.440
I watch a Ryan Gosling movie,
you know,

924
01:02:40.070 --> 01:02:42.370
and I think it's like the best thing I've ever seen.
Right.

925
01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:46.210
I watched fucking no strings attached with Ash Ashton Kutcher and Allie

926
01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:50.550
[inaudible].
This is a funny movie.
Yeah,
I was,
yeah,
I really thought it was good.

927
01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:55.170
So your,
your standards change when you're locked in the house.
Well,
yeah,

928
01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:57.960
when you're dealing with kids from,
you know,
you're,
you're so innocent,

929
01:02:57.961 --> 01:03:00.430
your existence gets way more innocent.
Interesting.

930
01:03:00.431 --> 01:03:02.590
I've never actually thought of it like that.
No,
I'm smarter.

931
01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:06.250
<v 16>Come on man.</v>

932
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:12.103
<v 4>Glue.</v>

933
01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:28.070
I like that a lot.
Let me see if this came in while we were doing this.

934
01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:33.290
Free Lab.
Dad says the funniest things ever seen.
So stupid.
You're my son.

935
01:03:34.490 --> 01:03:37.460
I'm your mom.
Um,

936
01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:42.530
cause I wanted to set this up.
I uh,
I spoke to my dad.

937
01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:46.480
Oh,
thank God.
It's that what our guy,
where the,

938
01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.940
Oh wait,
the best part about our masks by the way.
Yeah.

939
01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:57.010
Our pup masks is that you were out of town when they arrived there and I took

940
01:03:58.311 --> 01:04:01.220
him out of like Amazon boxes because I bought them on Amazon by the way,

941
01:04:01.221 --> 01:04:05.870
using our banner.
You can find anything on Amazon.
Yeah.
I fucking fetish masks.

942
01:04:05.871 --> 01:04:10.370
You name it.
So I had them out in our bedroom just like,

943
01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:15.970
Hey dad,
I'm sorry.
Throw him on our couch.
They're like our goal seat.
Yeah.
And,
um,

944
01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:17.301
our,
uh,

945
01:04:17.301 --> 01:04:22.160
our nanny sometimes makes up our room and I came back and she had neatly folded

946
01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:26.570
both like fetish masks.
Yeah.
And I'll,
I,
I was like,
Oh shit.

947
01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:29.020
You think she had any idea what's going on?
No.
Kind of like,

948
01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:33.370
remember the time in the house keeper put your cock rings and plastic bags.
Yeah.

949
01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:38.900
So she had to have noun.
Yeah.

950
01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:43.760
That was something hygienically not a favorite part about buying those cock

951
01:04:43.761 --> 01:04:44.390
rings by the way.

952
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:47.600
Well not maybe not those with the first one I bought cock rings was that I

953
01:04:47.601 --> 01:04:51.950
bought large thinking in my mind,
large adult.
Right.

954
01:04:52.310 --> 01:04:57.110
Not Enormous.
Deg Large.
Yeah.
I saw Lars and I was like,
oh,
like,

955
01:04:57.260 --> 01:05:00.920
like a large t shirt,
like the gays adult.
Right.
So I bought a shirt,

956
01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:05.100
a cock ring for like a giant cock.
Yeah.

957
01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:09.590
I could fold that cock ring and to and still stick my fingers to the sides of
it.

958
01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:14.700
Cause it,
how'd they get a housekeeper?
Must've been really impressed.
No,

959
01:05:14.701 --> 01:05:15.830
that's what I'm saying.
That was like,

960
01:05:15.831 --> 01:05:18.160
I'm s I'm talking about the first I ever bought.
Oh

961
01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:21.730
<v 0>does she put was just a normal one.
Yeah,
but I think she probably thought,</v>

962
01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:23.200
I don't think she knows what that is.

963
01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.800
I think she does because she put it in a Ziploc bag and put it in,

964
01:05:27.801 --> 01:05:28.920
kept it by bed.

965
01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:33.340
Go clean the bay in the bag as if to say,

966
01:05:33.370 --> 01:05:35.440
this is disgusting that you just left it out.

967
01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:40.780
There needs to be in a plastic container.
Dummy.
What if she was on a com strike?

968
01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:43.680
She probably is after that was on one.
He's like,

969
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:46.840
I'm not doing no come [inaudible] man,

970
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:51.110

Yeah.

971
01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:54.040
She doesn't realize she's doing it though.
She knows she wears plastic gloves.

972
01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:57.950
That's true.
She knows.
She knows you're an animal that Lou,
she doesn't,
you know,

973
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.710
make it a thing of it.
She doesn't make a thing of,

974
01:06:01.711 --> 01:06:06.280
you know.
Right.

975
01:06:06.281 --> 01:06:10.390

You wanted them to speak Spanish and try some Spanish.

976
01:06:11.350 --> 01:06:14.290
Now the sound is kind of shitty because he's on,

977
01:06:14.410 --> 01:06:17.650
he's driving and he's on his Bluetooth,
but you know you can still hear him.

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.370
<v 0>What about the museums and the artwork?</v>

1084
01:13:09.690 --> 01:13:12.720
<v 18>You know,
I've been to all those museums after a while they all look like,</v>

1085
01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:16.380
you know,
I mean,
I did that when I went to Spain,

1086
01:13:16.381 --> 01:13:19.930
which you know the grid really well.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why are you,

1087
01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:24.840
Maria and I were going through all these museums and it's basically some picture

1088
01:13:24.841 --> 01:13:25.674
of some,

1089
01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:30.860
some guy being tortured by the Spanish or one of a thousand pictures of,

1090
01:13:31.681 --> 01:13:35.460
you know,
Christ in different,
you know,
religious pictures.

1091
01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:36.930
But after a while,

1092
01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:44.700
<v 0>Oh
God,
of course.</v>

1093
01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:49.800
<v 18>You know,
the traditional paintings all look the same.
You get the,</v>

1094
01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:53.660
I make the Salvador Dali museum in and spanked.

1095
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:54.261
<v 0>By the way,</v>

1096
01:13:54.261 --> 01:13:58.490
I'm super impressed that he even pulled that up and the fact that it goes,

1097
01:13:58.491 --> 01:14:02.710
doesn't he have a museum in Spain that he remembers that I took him to one,

1098
01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:05.560
but I'm so impressed that he,
yeah.
Yeah,

1099
01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:12.340
he might,
there's a brainer.
Sophia has,
um,
I think modern artwork,

1100
01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:14.420
<v 18>you,
you know,</v>

1101
01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:18.170
some of that stuff is interesting to look at because you don't see my job,

1102
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:23.810
you know,
after a while

1103
01:14:25.690 --> 01:14:30.650
bored pretty quickly.
Why I tell you the museums,
I don't get bored.
I like the,

1104
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:34.460
all the museums or Washington DC,
the American district museum,

1105
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:41.090
Natural History Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago,

1106
01:14:42.930 --> 01:14:46.530
you know,
so I like,
you know,
American history.

1107
01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:51.530
I,
you know,
and I've seen a copy museum,

1108
01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:55.980
I mean the gold museum and after a while it's all gold.
Okay.

1109
01:14:56.530 --> 01:15:00.090
<v 4>Yeah.
Although they do have that nice torture museum there.</v>

1110
01:15:01.410 --> 01:15:03.780
<v 18>Yeah.
I went to see that.
What headquarters is Spanish.</v>

1111
01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:07.010
His Spanish are really good at that.
You know,
they,

1112
01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:11.770
they had this rule that you're not supposed to draw blood when you charge you

1113
01:15:11.771 --> 01:15:15.410
some money.
Yeah.

1114
01:15:15.411 --> 01:15:19.150
I was part of the magic and you know,
when,
this is where the religious things,

1115
01:15:20.730 --> 01:15:25.730
but they were really good at like Callie limbs out doing thing is that,

1116
01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:30.260
you know,
once you,
once you call somebody,
you know,
use the rack.

1117
01:15:30.261 --> 01:15:34.910
I'm somebody that is beyond repair hills people.
Yeah.
Basically.

1118
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:39.490
And they don't,
they cannot be thinking at that point.
Right.
That's nice.

1119
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:41.703
They're basically,

1120
01:15:42.890 --> 01:15:46.370
since I've been watching what I eat and I'm at a more disciplined,
I am now,

1121
01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:52.500
it's been,
I haven't had any,
you know,

1122
01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:55.960
I stay with,
I guess the best way to say it.

1123
01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:01.130
I stay in the really the,
the four to five range all the time now.

1124
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:02.220
It's kind of Nice.

1125
01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:03.350
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

1126
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:07.550
<v 18>it is.
But you know,
I haven't had a water too.
You have a long time.</v>

1127
01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:12.470
That must mean you're hydrating too.
Oh yeah.
Yeah,
it is.
And I haven't had,

1128
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.880
you know,
I did have a,
uh,
seven recently,
you know,

1129
01:16:17.890 --> 01:16:22.390
I'll get like some kind of bucking place,
but that came and went and,
Yep.

1130
01:16:22.890 --> 01:16:26.890
<v 4>So,
uh,
she,
he really keeps you up to date on all these.
Yeah.</v>

1131
01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:30.300
Just kind of goes into it too,
if you notice that.
Oh yeah,
no,
I'm prompted.
Yeah.

1132
01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:35.180
And a seven for a reminder for our listeners has,
is all liquid loose.
Yeah.
No.

1133
01:16:35.181 --> 01:16:38.400
What I love about the art art in the museum,
she's like,
you seen it already?

1134
01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:41.220
Just see it gold.
All right.
I'd seen it.
Yeah,
I know.
After a while.

1135
01:16:41.221 --> 01:16:42.330
Is that you just a lot of gold.

1136
01:16:43.670 --> 01:16:44.170
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1137
01:16:44.170 --> 01:16:48.050
<v 18>Yeah.
I heard that all that smelled really bad.
You said,</v>

1138
01:16:48.710 --> 01:16:51.620
Oh,
you have no idea.

1139
01:16:51.621 --> 01:16:54.040
I don't know what happened in my gut,

1140
01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:59.550
even by my standards of being growth,
which are extremely high.
Okay.
Yeah.

1141
01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:05.100
Yeah.
It's really,
really smell.
Yeah.
That's nice.
Oh,

1142
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:08.590
I made it there yet.
You don't have somebody at a meter.

1143
01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:12.050
You're like a breathalyzer or burst smell,
you know?

1144
01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:16.620
<v 19>Yeah.
This,
it had been four times the limit.
Okay.</v>

1145
01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.740
That's a pretty vivid picture.
I thank you for that.

1146
01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:24.560
<v 18>Yeah.
I always like to put things in.
You know,</v>

1147
01:17:24.561 --> 01:17:29.000
when I try to do is put things and you know,
so people can identify with me.

1148
01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:29.850
Okay.

1149
01:17:29.850 --> 01:17:31.110
<v 0>No,
I know.
That makes sense.</v>

1150
01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:35.130
So do you realize what's been sitting under our noses this entire time?

1151
01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:40.350
Did you pick up on it?
Right.
We have been speaking to a,
you know,

1152
01:17:40.351 --> 01:17:41.184
super champion.

1153
01:17:41.230 --> 01:17:42.600
<v 19>Oh my God,
you're ready.</v>

1154
01:17:42.930 --> 01:17:47.610
<v 0>He drops,
you know,
every five seconds and,
okay,</v>

1155
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.990
yeah.
Okay.
For sure.
But you know,
it was what Mike,
we are,

1156
01:17:51.991 --> 01:17:53.970
you know what I'm saying?
You know,
I'm feeling,
you know,
talking about,

1157
01:17:53.971 --> 01:17:58.260
and you know,
this huge and blue band picked up on it.

1158
01:17:58.350 --> 01:18:02.700
I made a top dog,
you know,
super.
Oh my God.
Amazing.
Amazing.

1159
01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:07.900
<v 19>No,
you know,
well,
you know,
you know,
you know,
you know,
you know,</v>

1160
01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:13.170
you know,
you know,
you know there's,
you know,
you know it's right.
You know,

1161
01:18:13.171 --> 01:18:14.190
I was like,
you know,
you know,

1162
01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:19.880
<v 0>oh wow.
Amazing.
He said,
you know,
and the funny thing is,
you know,</v>

1163
01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:24.870
blue band,
I had recorded this call and then I was playing it back,
you know,

1164
01:18:24.871 --> 01:18:28.710
it was running it through the system here,
you know,
and I know I said it too,

1165
01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:31.680
but during that playback,

1166
01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:36.600
I heard him say it 40 times,
right.
And I made note of it just like,
wow,

1167
01:18:36.601 --> 01:18:40.650
he really says it a lot.
Half an hour later,
blue band emails.

1168
01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:45.720
He says,
this whole time we've been sitting on a,
you know,

1169
01:18:45.721 --> 01:18:49.800
Gold Mine Gold Mine.
It's your dad.
Wow.
And you found this,
but it's,
you know,

1170
01:18:49.810 --> 01:18:53.220
super got together.
I also,
my mind is blown.
I ran over,

1171
01:18:53.221 --> 01:18:54.270
I grabbed that flash drive.

1172
01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:58.770
I found I was able to transfer over that just glass and Oh,
cool.

1173
01:18:59.220 --> 01:18:59.641
Oh Great.

1174
01:18:59.641 --> 01:19:04.641
This is the guy that made the beat box out of the judge glass in the hunting.

1175
01:19:05.131 --> 01:19:06.320
Now sort of sound

1176
01:19:10.570 --> 01:19:12.100
<v 20>go down right there.</v>

1177
01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:28.500
<v 19>Mm mm mm mm mm.</v>

1178
01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:23.660
<v 0>Isn't that amazing?
That is,
that is fucking who is this whole,</v>

1179
01:20:24.230 --> 01:20:29.100
damn,
that was so good.
Who Know,
how do people even hear a song and you know,

1180
01:20:29.610 --> 01:20:31.770
just glass and beat box by Dj Dad,

1181
01:20:31.771 --> 01:20:35.820
Moose and ambling and unbelievable.
It's so good.

1182
01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:40.260
There's definitely no other podcasts that has discovered this level of musical

1183
01:20:40.261 --> 01:20:42.810
talent out there.
I'm serious.
Well,
and it's interesting too,

1184
01:20:42.811 --> 01:20:46.680
because this with the,
hey mommy,
thanks genes phenomenon.
It's like,

1185
01:20:46.681 --> 01:20:49.000
you think it can't get any better.
Yeah.

1186
01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:52.350
And then some other mommy comes and escalates that game.
Right.

1187
01:20:52.351 --> 01:20:55.400
Like we thought we'd exhausted the Jess glass and guy.
Yeah.

1188
01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:00.030
And then this shows up.
It's just,
it's so fascinating.
It's so good.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1189
01:21:00.250 --> 01:21:05.120
It's really crazy,
man.
Pepperoni proceeded.
Which one has,

1190
01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:11.950
should I,
uh,
drag over a file here?
Oh,
right.
Yeah.
Just classes.

1191
01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:14.860
Just glass,
glass and glass.
A file.

1192
01:21:15.410 --> 01:21:20.410
There's a gender non Binary Pronoun here.

1193
01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:25.690
I got to,
maybe you can,

God dammit.
I it,

1194
01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:29.870
the week before was three 81 last time we did it.
Yeah.
Wait,
here we go.

1195
01:21:30.230 --> 01:21:32.990
Here's some that I don't think we have played.
And you see,

1196
01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:35.960
oh hey mommy,
I think so.

1197
01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:37.500
<v 21>Angle,
just gloss for minute</v>

1198
01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:43.880
or on that glass in your lost for a minute.
And these do they call me?

1199
01:21:44.450 --> 01:21:48.570
Hey talking chicken.
Yeah.
Chicken.
Yes.
Honest,

1200
01:21:48.610 --> 01:21:51.130
the arcane weekday paces of five,
nine,

1201
01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:55.640
21 in like the family bucket.
This stuff.

1202
01:21:55.641 --> 01:21:59.030
We have the Manga and then the mega pocket,

1203
01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:04.370
<v 22>uh,
did jeans.
Could I get a number one?
Uh,</v>

1204
01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:05.650
with no onion.

1205
01:22:06.970 --> 01:22:11.520
And then another dealt with my plastic gene as well.
Okay.

1206
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:16.440
One more time.
Uh,

Okay.

1207
01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:21.400
Uh,

1208
01:22:22.330 --> 01:22:23.260
Keeping myself hydrated.

1209
01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:31.350
A sprite to keep myself hydrated.
Okay.
Yeah,
that's fine.

1210
01:22:32.630 --> 01:22:36.260
Okay.
A non Muray mommy.

1211
01:22:38.770 --> 01:22:41.740
I said.
All right man.

1212
01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:50.120
Awesome.
Awesome.

1213
01:22:50.690 --> 01:22:54.360
Perfect.
Cool.
Thank you Molly.

1214
01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:00.900
<v 0>I liked it.
He's broke everyone.
No one breaks.
Know he broke.</v>

1215
01:23:00.901 --> 01:23:05.820
Doesn't Brendan high pay shorter.
When you're ready.
Hi.
Mommy can describe a,

1216

Take your time.

1269
01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:43.590
<v 0>You realize too that the funny thing about that expression,
yeah.</v>

1270
01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:48.490
Is that one really nobody needs explanation.
Yeah.
It kind of is intuitive.

1271
01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:51.710
It's intuitive.
Yeah.
You're like just glass and,
Oh,
you're,
you're looking.
Yeah.

1272
01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:53.350
And then,
and I feel like,

1273
01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:57.220
I feel like we helped introduce us the word into the lexicon.
We did we,
yeah,

1274
01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:00.340
we did.
Yeah.
It's amazing.
It existed but existed.

1275
01:27:00.341 --> 01:27:03.790
But I feel like we've given it a push.
Yeah,
yeah.

1276
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.940
<v 7>Yeah.
A White Mocha 20 outs.
They're like that hotter.
Cool.</v>

1277
01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:13.950
Um,
let's do it ice and also let me get a bottled water.

1278
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:15.910
I got to stay hydrated.
Okay.

1279
01:27:15.930 --> 01:27:20.130
And would you like the head table with that with wet please?

1280
01:27:21.090 --> 01:27:24.780
Would you like BD water or regular three or five regular water's fine.

1281
01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:29.300
Is that all for you?
Yep,
that'll be all high pull around.

1282
01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:31.260
[inaudible] Alrighty.
Thanks jeans.

1283
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:36.290
<v 0>That's fantastic.
That's Louie.
I liked it.
The Guy Laugh.
Yeah,
of course.</v>

1284
01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:37.190
Because it's so,

1285
01:27:37.190 --> 01:27:40.950
it's such nonsense that someone tells you I got to stay hydrated to,
yeah.

1286
01:27:41.810 --> 01:27:45.020
I imagine on if you're on the other and the receiving end of that ordering

1287
01:27:45.050 --> 01:27:48.580
though.
Yeah.
That you probably can't hear a lot of what people say.
Oh,
right.

1288
01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:53.720
Part of what people.
Okay.
Yeah.
Now,
if you want to up your,
hey mommy,

1289
01:27:53.721 --> 01:27:58.070
thanks genes game.
Yeah.
If you do it face to face with a waitress,

1290
01:27:58.071 --> 01:27:59.870
which you do.
Yeah,

1291
01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:03.370
that's I'd say a hundred bonus points face to face.
Yeah.

1292
01:28:03.410 --> 01:28:07.760
But the caveat being you can't do it to a native English speaker.
Yeah.

1293
01:28:07.761 --> 01:28:11.300
You've got to do it to somebody who English is a second language and not a very

1294
01:28:11.301 --> 01:28:13.230
good one at the point.
Well you can't at the moment.

1295
01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:14.660
You can do things when they're like,
hey,

1296
01:28:14.661 --> 01:28:17.380
we just got a table right here for you guys.
You Go,
thanks James.
Thanks James.

1297
01:28:17.381 --> 01:28:19.040
Yeah.
And then they're like,
hey,
I enjoy your meal.

1298
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:20.450
Like they don't pick up on it there.

1299
01:28:20.570 --> 01:28:22.910
If you're looking straight at him and be like,
hey mommy.
I mean,

1300
01:28:22.911 --> 01:28:26.120
that might be different,
but you've done it to our Asian waitresses.

1301
01:28:26.150 --> 01:28:28.700
I think you did it last night.
And we were eating Sushi,
you said,

1302
01:28:28.701 --> 01:28:31.670
thanks genes alive.
Yeah.
And then my favorite is when you're always like,

1303
01:28:31.671 --> 01:28:35.940
thanks gorgeous.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Beautiful.
Yeah.
So how can you bring me that?

1304
01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:39.950
The Chub,

Beautiful that they're like,
okay,

1305
01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:43.970
we did some shitty white guy.

1306
01:28:43.980 --> 01:28:48.980
I know I got a not another Ali's ease or songs and love it.

1307
01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:53.450
So,
um,
it's just like the gaze.
It's just like the case.

1308
01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:57.890
Thank you guys for listening.
Hopefully I'll get this fucking computer fixed.

1309
01:28:58.570 --> 01:29:02.480
Weird.

1310

Money to fix it better.</v>
