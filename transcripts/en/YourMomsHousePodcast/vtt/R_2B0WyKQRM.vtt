Welcome to stripper reviews because here I am all alone with my hand Jang off

13
00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:06.360

It's so dynamic that he really is.

It's always the cool guys.
The hot guys,

19
00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:36.060
the guys worthy of strippers that love reviewing women was there.

20
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.220
What is making demands,
you know,
I don't even know.

21
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.330
<v 2>Oh,
we're going to talk about strippers.
K One time,</v>

22
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.970
salt up a Swedish Filipina named Brittany.
And uh,
it was pretty fun.

23
00:01:46.971 --> 00:01:48.040
She was pretty game.

24
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.540
You touch her ass and her titties as much as she went on during the dance and

25
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.070
she didn't let me go downtown.
That was a,
I don't care.
Ass and titties.

26
00:01:57.071 --> 00:01:59.200
I mean for $20 a dance at the time.

27
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.060
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
That is their job,
isn't it?</v>

28
00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:04.890
To let you touch them in some places I guess.

29
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.970
I mean in acts one $8 to,

30
00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:10.480
it's like 40 easy way,

31
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.860
<v 2>which was what it was.
It's not anymore.</v>

32
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.850
33rd Taiwan,

33
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.800
they 40 with top law used to be $20 from top off.
Oh Gee.

34
00:02:20.801 --> 00:02:21.281
Wow.

35
00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:26.281
How'd it made her action with an Ethiopian stripper name of Alisay

36
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.760
dry sex is fun.
Contacts

37
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.390
<v 0>wrong with this person.
Hold on.
All right.
Sorry.</v>

38
00:02:46.391 --> 00:02:51.391
I just wanted to make sure that we were recording the correct Chicco watts.

39
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.880
Well,
you want to hear everything that this guy has to say.
I mean,

40
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.390
I just got the Alice a review.
Let's see what else he's got.

41
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.080
<v 2>No,
she dropped down to her</v>

42
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.320
<v 0>knees,
you times and play with my dick through my shorts.</v>

43
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.950
You're wearing shorts to the Strip club and I'm wearing basketball shorts to the

44
00:03:09.951 --> 00:03:13.080
strip club.
It was fine.
You know,
I think she likes my deck.
You,

45
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.140
I had a decent job on it wasn't,
you know,

46
00:03:15.141 --> 00:03:19.460
the best I've ever had and I'm pretty proud of the width of my penis when it's

47
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.220
fully gorge.
First of all,

48
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.250
can we just celebrate happening memory and his ability to recollect every detail

49
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.610
of the girls.
Look her name,
what she remembers when we back when it was $20.

50
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.990
Now it's $40.
Yeah.
He knows what Al is a was her ethnic background.

51
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.720
That's fantastic.
It is.
I think it's a mark of youth.

52
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.470
They say you remember lots of details when you're young and then by our age it's

53
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.710
just gone.
Right.
A game board partner if you were playing,
you know,

54
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.210
board games.
True.
Yeah.
Um,
a really good thing is,
uh,

55
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.670
well we've got all the marks of a great home video number one,
the background,

56
00:03:59.671 --> 00:04:02.910
he's in the bathroom,
so there was a shower curtain audio.

57
00:04:02.911 --> 00:04:05.490
There's a weird humming sound in the background.
It's hard to,

58
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.100
it's got an impressive shower.
If we're going to be honest,

59
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.870
it's not flattering.
This is like,
you know,
it's,

60
00:04:12.871 --> 00:04:16.800
it's a in your twenties it's just what it is.
Yeah.

61
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.210
I think isn't a 20 it looks,
it doesn't look so young,
but he's youthful.

62
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.280
But he's one of those guys that went bald at 18 you know those unfortunate
souls.

63
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.650
I feel so bad for them.
You should do what I'm doing.

64
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.790
I can't believe he's not going all the way.
Same length.
Sure.

65
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.610
He's actually letting the horse shoe kind of grow out and in your twenties that

66
00:04:35.611 --> 00:04:40.420
is n sanity to look at it.
I hate when it happens for guys that early.

67
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.250
It's so sad.
It's not fair.
Life is cruel.
It's got a bad beard,

68
00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:48.420
mustache game to talk shit cause it's trimming the mustache down or it's not

69
00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:53.040
growing in very beard.
Painful or somewhat full.
Yeah.

70
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.820
I don't.
So can I ask you as a guy,
$1 million makeover.
Yeah.

71
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.460
We what,
what compels a young man to make reviews like this.

72
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.710
Like he probably knows on some level it's not a good idea.
Right.
You know,

73
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.620
he's probably,
he knows it's mean spirited.
The way we're critiquing his looks.

74
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.190
Yeah.
I don't think he thinks it's mean spirited.
It's,
it's,

75
00:05:14.191 --> 00:05:18.540
you're so oversexed and you so want sex,
but you figured talking about sex,

76
00:05:18.541 --> 00:05:22.200
some part of your mind goes,
if you put it out there,
it might lead to,

77
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.160
that's really what your brain's doing.
It's the secret.
It's like if I build it,

78
00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:27.220
they will.
He just wants,

79
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.090
he wants sex and this is just the best they can do right now.
Yeah,

80
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.630
yeah,
yeah.

81
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.700
Until he finds his own pair of jeans and then you can fart 33,600 times.

82
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.790
That's exactly what I've done.
And 14 I had some far too yesterday.
Yeah.

83
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.970
Well you did the night before.
Yeah.
Well here's what your Apricot,
oh my God,

84
00:05:50.971 --> 00:05:55.290
I'm so stupid because I was constipated and I got these hemorrhoids leftover

85
00:05:55.291 --> 00:05:59.750
from pregnancy and I started eating dried apricots cause that usually does the

86
00:05:59.751 --> 00:06:04.250
job right quick.
Yeah.
And I ate a bunch of them and it was rancid.

87
00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:07.430
It smells like sulfur cause there's so much bad in the apricot's.
Right?
Yeah.

88
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.310
Holy Cow.
Well,
what caused your farts?
I don't understand.

89
00:06:10.311 --> 00:06:12.530
We all want the same thing that was on the rip tickle.

90
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.400
You ripped it care for that.
That cardio,
yeah.
Gets your,

91
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.550
your system going.
And the thing is,
I had some sneaky like,
Eh,

92
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.710
kind of park and I was like,
yeah,
this sucks.
You know?

93
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.410
And then as I was going,
going,

94
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.260
I had like a big burst to come out.
Uh,

95
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.220
it was nearly sexual in nature.
Feels good,
Huh?
It didn't smell good,

96
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.061
but it felt good.

97
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:41.330
Can I tell you the dumbest thing I did though is that I ate those apricots and

98
00:06:41.331 --> 00:06:45.800
then went to get a massage and I mean,
how stupid can you be?
Pretty stupid.

99
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.400
I was like,
what am I thinking?
And I had the whole,
I really,

100
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.120
I fell asleep on the table and then I had to like wake up quickly and really

101
00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:57.020
clench my butt cheeks together because one was about to like really escaped.

102
00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.890
Yeah.
Yeah.
So no,
it,
it's not good.

103
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.290
Was here and talking about his dick more.
Okay.

104
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.700
<v 2>It's halfhearted.
It's halfhearted.
A pretty good shot.</v>

105
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.280
I don't know how to like serious chubs this year.
I'm looking out on my deck,

106
00:07:13.281 --> 00:07:16.420
like that's a monster.
I got it.
I'm good.
And all I am

107
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.030
saying this on camera at all.
I asked,
he was master.

108
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.790
<v 0>Yeah.
See he goes,
I'm saying this on camera.</v>

109
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.380
He knows it's his mind telling them like,
why are you doing it?

110
00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:29.920
Like I'll put this out there.
Yeah,

111
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.460
he knows you're still overwhelmed with horniness.
Yeah,

112
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.370
he knows he nasty.
It's,
it's um,

113
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.400
it's inhibiting his ability to actually restrain poor judgment.

114
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:46.570
That's how overwhelming that testosterone be.
The buildup of,

115
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.960
of all that pent up stuff.
And then he's like,

116
00:07:49.961 --> 00:07:52.980
I'm just going to talk about coming and since I'm not telling you there's a,

117
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.770
there's a window in,
in men's life that it's just overwhelming.

118
00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:01.240
What is that age like?
It starts,
it starts,
if it really,

119
00:08:01.241 --> 00:08:06.241
I think you really peak out between 17 and 22.

120
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:12.250
Those are,
that's the window of like,
Oh
yeah.

121
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.950
That's where it's the most intense and that's,
yeah.

122
00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.070
And that's when you can get into the most trouble with and that's what usually

123
00:08:18.071 --> 00:08:21.460
happens.
And that's your life guys.
Act The most recklessly and yeah.

124
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.080
Impulse control.
Oh my goodness.
Yes.
So I guess,
okay.
Yeah,

125
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:30.220
we should probably pass,
pause,
pause.
We'll keep this going here.
Okay.

126
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.130
All right.
We're back.
Yeah.

127
00:08:32.131 --> 00:08:36.840
We had to do a quick pause because our esteemed guest has a role and we're

128
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.990
excited.
So you guys were on already ready.

Very good.

138
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:20.770
Because you're married to a Canadian.
That's right.
That's right.

139
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:25.760
Nobody else would know that auto was the capital.
Yeah.
No,

140
00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:31.420
I know that I is,
is really nice.
Like I hear it's the,

141
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.830
it's the Beverly Hills of Canada,
right?
Yeah.
Uh,
it's,

142
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:40.530
it's more like the,
uh,
the Laughlin,
Nevada of Canada.

143
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.640
It's very fitting for me.
It's,
it's kind of like a casino town.
Sure.

144
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.450
<v 4>I will have three real estate.
Yeah.
I have two.
I have two.
Uh,</v>

145
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.750
I can,
I cannot tell a lie though.
I've never been to Windsor.

146
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.480
<v 3>Okay.
I hear what I heard.
That's where people go to drink from Detroit.</v>

147
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.670
<v 5>Is there a surprise city in,
in let's say,</v>

148
00:10:02.671 --> 00:10:07.650
in terms of if you're traveling,
doing stand up that I'm like,
everybody knows,

149
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.540
you know,
we all hit Toronto,
Vancouver,
Montreal.
As you guys say,

150
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.810
Calgary,
Winnipeg,
Toronto.
What's the city that you're like,
you know what,
this is,

151
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.900
wouldn't normally be on your list,
but you should hit it.

152
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:23.250
<v 4>Ottawa.
Really?
I'd say so.
Yeah.
Okay.
Cause it's the capital.</v>

153
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.450
So there's lots of,
you know,
nice architecture,

154
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:32.550
lots of museums,
lots of,
it's a,
it's a million people.

155
00:10:32.551 --> 00:10:36.780
So it's a
big,
small city.
Yeah.

156
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.010
That's more than,
you know,
it's,
it's not,
uh,
not like big,

157
00:10:41.011 --> 00:10:44.620
like Toronto or Montreal or Vancouver,
but,
uh,
yeah,
it's,
it's a,
it's,

158
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.520
it's because it's the capital.
It's interesting.
Very beautiful city.

159
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:51.980
Go in the summer,
don't go in the winter.
Very cold.
Very cold city.
Yeah.
Yeah.

160
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:56.790
Um,
you know,
but,
uh,
you know,
other cities,
uh,
now,
I mean,

161
00:10:56.791 --> 00:11:01.020
you pretty much named them all,
you know,
Calgary,
Edmonton,
Edmonton,
Edmonton.
Yeah.

162
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.320
I'll probably,
you know,
at another city I've not been to in Canada,

163
00:11:04.321 --> 00:11:09.321
which I am sort of wish I have had been there as Saint John's Newfoundland.

164
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.840
I have to stick.
That would be a very unique,
see,
that's what I'm looking for.

165
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.200
Yeah.
You get out there.
You're so almost like going to Ireland.
Okay.

166
00:11:16.201 --> 00:11:19.440
I haven't been there,
but uh,
Prince Edward Island,
Charlotte town,

167
00:11:19.441 --> 00:11:22.110
Prince Edward Island's kind of like that.
Okay.
The maritimes,

168
00:11:22.111 --> 00:11:23.820
the East Coast Halifax.

169
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.840
<v 5>Yeah.
Yeah.
Very.
You know what,
that,
um,</v>

170
00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.950
that summer winter thing reminds me of is when I first started touring and

171
00:11:29.951 --> 00:11:33.310
working,
I started to go to Canada twice a year,
some in some places,

172
00:11:33.311 --> 00:11:37.180
but I went every year to like those five,
six places.
And you know,

173
00:11:37.181 --> 00:11:38.890
that second time you come through,

174
00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:43.390
I guess you go in like February and you're like,
Hey,
fuck you,
my bad full house.

175
00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:47.410
They're like,
yeah,
it's fucking 30 below out coming June.
Yeah.
Like you'll still,

176
00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.130
you'll sell eight tickets.
And I'd be like,
Oh yeah,

177
00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:53.970
they just the opposite of la because it drizzles everybody stays in

178
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.380
<v 0>doors.
Yeah.
No,
but it's the example climates,</v>

179
00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:58.330
they all come out cause there and it's crazy.

180
00:11:58.331 --> 00:12:00.670
Literally they have like six sold out shows and you're like,
wow,

181
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.820
like is everyone here to see me?
And they're like,
no,
no,

182
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.770
they're all sold out all winter.
They just want to be inside.

183
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:11.560
They're looking for something to do.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well it's,
uh,
it's,

184
00:12:11.561 --> 00:12:12.221
it's,
it's,

185
00:12:12.221 --> 00:12:16.570
it's kind of a bit of a catch 22 because it sucks being there in the winter

186
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.960
socks.
Yeah.
We're done.
That,
you know,

187
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.820
it's almost like more fun to go up and sell six tickets and be warm.
I know,

188
00:12:24.821 --> 00:12:28.750
right.
It's so brutally cold for me.
Yeah.
You know,

189
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.880
it's funny to get in the argument like what's the coldest,

190
00:12:30.881 --> 00:12:34.840
but I think the coldest week that I experienced on the road was in Winnipeg.

191
00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:40.090
Yeah.
It was like January or something like that.

192
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:45.430
Was Un fucking believable.
It's so crazy.

193
00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:49.310
I'll do Canadians.
I mean this is a question that I get asked,
but uh,

194
00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.750
I'm curious to know from your American perspective.
Yeah.

195
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.480
Do Canadians laugh differently?

196
00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:00.490
Is it a different reaction to the comedy?
I don't think so.
No.
No.

197
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:05.080
Is it tempered slightly?
When we did that,
it was bonkers.

198
00:13:05.081 --> 00:13:07.690
I feel like they're more down to have fun.

199
00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:13.580
I used to always say this thing that I feel like is I still think holds true and

200
00:13:13.601 --> 00:13:17.610
that is that I think smarter crowds in,

201
00:13:17.611 --> 00:13:20.560
in smarter demographics get sarcasm.

202
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:26.070
And I find that for the most part that always translated in Canada,

203
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:30.150
which is that like you have your hard jokes and then you know like I would,

204
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:35.170
I do like tags that are,
that can be a throwaway line.

205
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:40.090
Sometimes those throwaway lines in certain places get like a 30% of the audience

206
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.730
and there's a lot of times that I would go to Canada.

207
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:47.250
I'm like 100% of the audience was with me on every throwaway line.

208
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:52.040
It's more like a Seattle type crowd.
Yeah.
Then a uh,

209
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:56.860
you know,
Huntsville,
Alabama toe
a little bit closer to scout.

210
00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.780
I think so.
I mean I had great,

211
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:03.820
I did have one time now I remember the time that I did Calgary and it was like

212
00:14:03.821 --> 00:14:08.821
15 minutes in and I was telling stories as you know,

213
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:14.120
the bit was like that that telling the story of what happened is the routine,

214
00:14:15.491 --> 00:14:15.761
right?

215
00:14:15.761 --> 00:14:19.600
Like I was on the flight and the Guy Duh Duh Duh Duh and like 10 minutes in this

216
00:14:19.601 --> 00:14:24.280
guy goes,
are you going to tell a joke?
And I go,
these are jokes.
Like,

217
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:27.910
this is a story with jokes in it.
It was like,
man,

218
00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.730
I'm about to see Henny Youngman.
Yeah,
yeah.
And I was like,
all right.

219
00:14:30.731 --> 00:14:34.030
I remember specifically that that was a Calgary that's,
that's a,

220
00:14:34.031 --> 00:14:38.380
that was probably just a,
that's just a weird rogue.
Yeah.
Occurrence I think.

221
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.540
I think so.
But I know I've had amazing,

222
00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:45.130
the place I used to go twice a year for a while was the comedy mix in Vancouver.

223
00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:49.850
Okay.
I grew up in there.
Really?
No,
it's a,
okay.

224
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.040
Well I think this was the old,
yes.
Okay.

225
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.150
<v 3>And it's on Bernard Street at the Century Plaza Hotel downstairs.</v>

226
00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.470
Fucking tremendous.
Yeah.
I think that is the old Yuk calcs.
Giulia.

227
00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.950
So it's really good.
But I know that Yucky Alex has that.
Uh,

228
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.380
they had that thing in Canada where they're like,

229
00:15:06.381 --> 00:15:10.340
you play us and you don't fucking play anywhere else if you're starting out

230
00:15:10.341 --> 00:15:15.020
there.
Yeah.
They really get upset.
Right.
I,
I,
uh,
I started doing standup,

231
00:15:15.021 --> 00:15:18.710
but y'all kicks when I was a teenager.
I read this about you,
that you started,

232
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:24.280
because
I remember them saying on Tom Green,
start doing standup.

233
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.390
I saw at the ice house and I was like,
that can't be right.

234
00:15:26.391 --> 00:15:30.970
This guy has been funny for a million years.
And you started at 15,
it says,
yeah.

235
00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:35.620
<v 4>And at the same,
the same club,
the clubs move,
but it's the same owner.
Um,</v>

236
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.650
uh,
Howard Wagman he's been there,
been there since we're over 30 years,
you know,

237
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:45.910
and a great guy.
And uh,
yeah,
but I mean,
I wasn't touring,
you know,
I didn't tour.

238
00:15:45.911 --> 00:15:48.220
I was,
I was,
I started doing amateur night.

239
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:53.020
I'd go down when I was a kid because I wanted to see Harland Williams.

240
00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.570
<v 3>I love Harland,
Norm Macdonald.</v>

241
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.500
I wanted to see those are like your heroes,
Jeremy Hotz.
They were,

242
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.450
<v 4>I'll uh,
Canadians and they're all,</v>

243
00:16:02.451 --> 00:16:04.610
they were the headliners in Canada at the time.

244
00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:09.820
<v 3>Don't know how hot of a hand Jeremy Hotz has had in,
in standup,</v>

245
00:16:09.821 --> 00:16:10.660
especially in Canada.

246
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.800
<v 4>I mean these,
these,
these,
these guys were,</v>

247
00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.350
they were all in their twenties though then.

248
00:16:14.351 --> 00:16:17.510
And they hadn't even moved to the states yet.
Harland and Norma had,

249
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.700
norm wasn't an on Saturday night live yet.

250
00:16:19.701 --> 00:16:21.440
I remember when they all moved down here.

251
00:16:21.441 --> 00:16:25.040
It was kind of like very inspiring because,
you know,

252
00:16:25.041 --> 00:16:26.690
I was sort of a kid and I thought,
oh,

253
00:16:26.691 --> 00:16:31.250
these guys were like 10 years older than me,
so I was sort of the,
the dream was,

254
00:16:31.251 --> 00:16:35.300
wow,
they're going off to Edmonton tomorrow to do more standup.
Yeah.

255
00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.580
Well I'm just stuck here in Ottawa.

256
00:16:37.581 --> 00:16:39.860
There are going to the Yuk Yuks and the Edmonton tomorrow.

257
00:16:39.861 --> 00:16:44.570
So it was amazing to think that you could just travel around doing standup,

258
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.540
you know?
Um,
but,
uh,
but,
uh,
I,
uh,

259
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.830
I did it until I did it probably till I was about 20 and then I stopped and uh,

260
00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.760
started,
uh,
I went back to school,

261
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.970
took a broadcasting and so eight started my show.

262
00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:03.410
What is the time off between 20 and when you start it again?
How long?

263
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:07.700
Probably about 35.
I'm 59 years away.
Yeah.
I mean,

264
00:17:07.701 --> 00:17:11.240
I don't think I ever really,
you know,
was,

265
00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:16.640
yeah.
Basically for 15 years,
I was,
um,
I was,

266
00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:20.510
I was doing a college radio show and then I started the Tom Green show and I

267
00:17:20.511 --> 00:17:25.230
just did that all day,
every day.
You know,
that's all I did for 15 years was,

268
00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:29.770
was basically worried about,
uh,
you know,
making weird videos and stuff.
Yeah.

269
00:17:29.771 --> 00:17:34.490
Well I kinda like,
I kinda just,
uh,
I,
I definitely regret in some way,
not regret,

270
00:17:34.491 --> 00:17:36.620
but sometimes I think in hindsight,
like,
man,

271
00:17:36.621 --> 00:17:39.540
if I would have been nice to have been doing standup when my show was on him

272
00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.660
<v 3>TV,
that would have a good time to be there on the road.</v>

273
00:17:43.661 --> 00:17:47.090
But I told you this at the comedy store the other night.
I,

274
00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.950
cause it's Kinda like we talked about that.
Yeah,
he did it because I,

275
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
<v 5>it's,
it's kind of funny sometimes when you do this and you know,</v>

276
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:58.230
you're working as a comic and then you see people in the green room where you're

277
00:17:58.231 --> 00:18:02.550
like,
Holy Shit.
And it is Kinda funny man to me that,
you know,

278
00:18:02.551 --> 00:18:06.540
your show.
I,
I think a lot of people may be experienced that a lot of people,

279
00:18:06.541 --> 00:18:09.060
but some people experience having a show or you know,

280
00:18:09.061 --> 00:18:11.100
working on a show and you're like,
I was on TV,

281
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:15.750
but your show was the first of its kind.
It was,

282
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:18.470
it's been,
you see a lot of bad imitation,

283
00:18:18.471 --> 00:18:23.130
some goat imitations of you and what you did.
Like you're a true original.

284
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:28.080
And that was a must see television for us.
I don't know.

285
00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.940
I mean I'm sure you read,
you realize it,
but like for me,
I mean what I was,

286
00:18:32.941 --> 00:18:36.960
I think we figured out that I was probably 18 or 19.

287
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:38.663
Oh yeah.

288
00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.990
<v 4>Yeah.
Blew our fucking mind.
You our minds,
man.
Oh,
it was,
it was,</v>

289
00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:45.560
it was,

290
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.590
<v 5>what was it at the peak of that being on MTV,</v>

291
00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.480
what was that experience like for you?

292
00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:55.570
<v 4>I mean,
it was a,
it was a sort of a surreal,
you know,
uh,</v>

293
00:18:55.571 --> 00:19:00.460
very surreal few years when just readjusting to that cause to that level of
fame.

294
00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:04.360
Yeah.
Well,
cause you know,
I did the show,
like I said,
I was doing Yaki ox.

295
00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.380
I say,
I don't even say I was doing stand up,
I was doing Yuk Yuks when I was 15.

296
00:19:08.381 --> 00:19:11.580
You know,
I was doing,
I wasn't doing that as a kid.
And then I,

297
00:19:11.581 --> 00:19:13.210
I what actually happened,

298
00:19:13.211 --> 00:19:18.211
I got this record deal in Canada for a rap group that I was in when I was 19.

299
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:23.440
And that's kind of why I stopped doing the standup cause we went and we started

300
00:19:23.441 --> 00:19:27.040
this rap,
well,
I'd been doing it,
we go with your group calls,

301
00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:31.630
we're called Oregonized rhyme and we got nominated for a Juno award in Canada,

302
00:19:31.631 --> 00:19:34.730
which is like a Canadian grammy.
And we had,

303
00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:38.320
we had a hit record but you know,
hit record in Canada.
Like,
you know,

304
00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.750
we didn't make any money or anything like that.
It was just kind of like,

305
00:19:40.751 --> 00:19:45.480
it was number one on the top 10 at 10 on the radio.
But you know,

306
00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:50.080
we weren't selling records or anything like that.
And um,
and then,

307
00:19:50.081 --> 00:19:53.410
um,
you know,
that kind of fizzled out.

308
00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:56.470
I went back to school and uh,

309
00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:00.130
and started the show with my friends from college,

310
00:20:00.131 --> 00:20:03.850
from broadcasting school and did the show for about five years.

311
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.570
And you're just doing this for funnel and terribly volunteered a public access

312
00:20:07.571 --> 00:20:12.380
station,
making videos,
making videos and it's hard.
It's all,
by the way,

313
00:20:12.381 --> 00:20:16.360
this is like editing on avid machine.
They didn't have,
no,
not even that.

314
00:20:16.361 --> 00:20:18.280
It was actually tape.
So you were,

315
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:23.750
it was tape to tape Beta cam or three quarter inch tape or high eight tape.

316
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:25.630
So you'd have two machines.

317
00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:29.980
I edited everything myself so that's why I went to broadcasting school cause I

318
00:20:29.981 --> 00:20:32.350
figured no one was ever going to make my show

319
00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.640
<v 5>no expectations while you're doing this like that it would</v>

320
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:37.220
<v 4>ah no,
I was,</v>

321
00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:42.200
I was kind of a very motivated and driven kid so I was actually,

322
00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:46.810
I did have expectations.
I was trying to sell the show from the day.
Uh,

323
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:51.040
but you know like where you getting feedback?
Like were people coming up to you?

324
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:56.110
I was like,
uh,
like a total nerd,
like video geek.

325
00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:57.340
And I mean,

326
00:20:57.341 --> 00:21:01.090
the way I got the record deal was because I started buying a lot of like,

327
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:05.500
like I work a summer job and buy a drum machine and then I'd make this rap demo.

328
00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:08.170
Uh Huh.
And then I would go to like,

329
00:21:08.171 --> 00:21:10.450
when a local Canadian rap group was performing,

330
00:21:10.451 --> 00:21:14.650
I'd show up with my demo tape and like,
like hand it to the,
the,
the manager,

331
00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.490
you know?
Yeah.
And it's not so,
so I sort of like kind of hustled a little bit,

332
00:21:18.491 --> 00:21:22.870
you know,
cause I was scared shitless that I was going to have to like,
you know,

333
00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:25.940
keep working at dairy queen or whatever else.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

334
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:30.940
So I was just terrified of having a,
here's a great motivator.
Marketing jobs.

335
00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.540
I was working as a mover,
I was working as a landscaper,

336
00:21:34.541 --> 00:21:39.190
I was doing tons of stuff like that,
so I was terrified.
So,
so,
uh,

337
00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.053
you know,

338
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:45.400
but basically when the show got picked up by MTV,

339
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.100
it was kind of like,
you know,

340
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.950
10 years of like hustling around trying to make something happen and then all of

341
00:21:50.951 --> 00:21:54.940
a sudden,
you know,
it,
it sort of exploded overnight on MTV,

342
00:21:54.941 --> 00:21:59.200
which was shocking because,
you know,
we didn't,

343
00:21:59.201 --> 00:22:03.940
we didn't have MTV in Canada,
so we had much music.
Yeah.

344
00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:07.510
I sorta sorta the same thing,
but are you living still in k?

345
00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.980
Like do you fly over to make it or so,
so I was living,
uh,

346
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.370
in Canada and uh,
and I sent,

347
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:18.500
I mean,
there's the,

348
00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:23.710
the long short story is I went and did this talk show in Canada called the Mike

349
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:26.320
Bullard show.
It was the David Letterman of Canada.

350
00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:31.450
And I would do these ridiculous stunts on the show by things that I'm not even

351
00:22:31.451 --> 00:22:35.750
sure I want to repeat.
Like I showed up with a suitcase and a,
as I repeat,

352
00:22:35.751 --> 00:22:39.190
it showed up with a suitcase handcuffed to me.

353
00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.700
And then in the middle of interview I opened it and there was a dead raccoon in

354
00:22:42.701 --> 00:22:44.750
it,
and it's rotting.
Oh.

355
00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:49.970
And I started shaving it and then they have to stop tape and the host goes and

356
00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.710
is sick,
you know,
and uh,
it's like,

357
00:22:53.711 --> 00:22:57.670
makes like news and stuff in Canada.
It was a,

358
00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:02.170
I should not be repeating this should,
uh,
I should not be turned on.
It's on,

359
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.760
it's on youtube.
But uh,
anyways,
so at that,

360
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:10.580
at one of those tapings,
uh,
I met,
um,

361
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.790
my future manager,

362
00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:17.791
who's now my friend Howard Lapidus and he managed Dr drew and Adam Carolla.

363
00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.020
Yeah.

364
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:24.250
And they were doing love line on MTV and he saw my crazy talk show appearance

365
00:23:24.251 --> 00:23:27.340
and I give him some tapes and he took him to MTV and that's how I got an SUV.

366
00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.970
<v 0>Isn't that crazy?
Wow.</v>

367
00:23:28.971 --> 00:23:33.680
So we know what I love about your story is that you did that self hustle and an

368
00:23:33.681 --> 00:23:37.850
era where it kind of wasn't as easy as it is now.

369
00:23:37.851 --> 00:23:41.690
Like you hear kids complaining like,
how do,
why it's like,
Bro,
you've got this,

370
00:23:41.691 --> 00:23:44.930
this is all you fucking need now.
You can make a TV show on this.

371
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:46.070
There's no excuse to

372
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.990
<v 4>not do it now,
but to do it,</v>

373
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:52.910
how to punk rock is it that you did it in a time where it was fucking so hard to

374
00:23:52.911 --> 00:23:57.200
do and no money and no brain was sort of like saw,
like the,

375
00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:01.310
you couldn't go buy a video camera because a video camera was $2,000.

376
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.130
And then if once you had a video camera,
what are you gonna do with that?

377
00:24:04.131 --> 00:24:05.300
You can't edit the video.

378
00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:09.260
How thought about where I went to college so I could get my hands on a video

379
00:24:09.261 --> 00:24:12.650
camera.
He's how plant,
how planned out were bits.

380
00:24:12.651 --> 00:24:14.090
Were these like just off the top of your head,

381
00:24:14.091 --> 00:24:18.670
let's just do this sort of a mixture like,
uh,
so like,
uh,

382
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:23.420
we would spend a lot of our time writing,
you know,
we'd sit down,

383
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:26.840
me and my buddies and we think of what's the most ridiculous thing we can think

384
00:24:26.841 --> 00:24:31.610
of to do and we'd,
you know,
plan things out.

385
00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:37.150
And then we would also do a lot of just sort of wandering around the city with a

386
00:24:38.031 --> 00:24:41.360
video camera,
talking to people.
Um,

387
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:45.290
so there's a mixture of things like the prank.
So my parents were planned out,

388
00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.110
you know,
um,
but,
uh,
you know,

389
00:24:48.111 --> 00:24:52.070
and there was lots of sort of performance already kind of stunts and things like

390
00:24:52.071 --> 00:24:52.550
that.

391
00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.490
But then sometimes stuff would just happen where like a guy would start yelling

392
00:24:55.491 --> 00:24:58.650
at me on the street and that was like funnier than anything.
So,
you know,

393
00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.680
so great parents.
I mean,

394
00:25:00.681 --> 00:25:05.210
you were doing clubs at 15 and they seemed very unfazed by

395
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:07.700
your shell.

396
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:12.100
What was the attitude and in real life about all this stuff about you?
Uh,

397
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:17.060
well they were always very supportive.
I'm very supportive of everything,

398
00:25:17.061 --> 00:25:20.630
but then the show got a little,
you know,
in their face,
you know,

399
00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:24.680
and they were conflicted because,
uh,
you know,
the,

400
00:25:24.681 --> 00:25:27.110
I was in college studying this stuff,

401
00:25:27.111 --> 00:25:32.111
so he sort of saw that I was applying myself to my college by,

402
00:25:32.211 --> 00:25:35.420
you know,
making videos.
But,
but,
uh,
we would,
we would go,

403
00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:37.190
we would get them a lot in the middle of the night.

404
00:25:37.191 --> 00:25:41.330
So they were less supportive cause it was three o'clock in the morning when we

405
00:25:41.331 --> 00:25:46.190
were barging into their room or whatever.
But,
um,
yeah,
you know,
uh,

406
00:25:46.191 --> 00:25:49.840
they,
they were,
they were supportive when I was a kid,
when I was,
uh,
you know,

407
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:53.780
when I was 16 years old,
we are 17 years old.

408
00:25:53.781 --> 00:25:57.170
We had this opportunity to go record music in New York and they like paid for

409
00:25:57.171 --> 00:25:59.150
are,
you know,
uh,
you know,

410
00:25:59.151 --> 00:26:02.330
our trip down there and me and my buddy from my rap group and we went down to

411
00:26:02.331 --> 00:26:05.330
New York,
Richard Music for the summer and you know,

412
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:10.450
I snuck into NBC and snuck into the Letterman studio and all sorts of stuff,

413
00:26:10.611 --> 00:26:13.250
like really got kicked out.
But yeah.
What was,
um,

414
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:17.270
what did they think of like the explosion of the show?

415
00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:19.460
You know,
I,
uh,

416
00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:23.300
like they were like really happy when the show got picked up because they

417
00:26:23.301 --> 00:26:27.440
figured that I was like gone,
you know,
and I looked cause MPV,
basically,

418
00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:31.640
to answer your question,
familiar,
MTV basically saw the tapes.

419
00:26:31.641 --> 00:26:36.560
So we sent them the tapes and,
uh,
they said,
do you have any more of these tapes?

420
00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.310
You know,
I sent like my five favorite clips.
Right?
Yeah.

421
00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.780
So do you have any more of these videos?
I said,
ah,
yeah,

422
00:26:41.781 --> 00:26:45.590
I have about 1000 of these videos actually all on bay,
you know,

423
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.860
mastered on Beta Cam,
you know,
real professional at that time,

424
00:26:49.861 --> 00:26:54.840
professional level,
you know.
And uh,
they said,
okay,

425
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.550
we want you to come pitch the show.
And they flew me down to La,

426
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:05.340
put me up in the Chateau Marmont.
Uh,
no,
the,
the,
the,
the Mondrian Hotel,

427
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:07.860
the Mondrian.
And then,
uh,

428
00:27:07.861 --> 00:27:12.861
I had to go over and pitch the show to the MTV executives at the House of Blues

429
00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:16.990
and on this big pitch session.
And,
uh,

430
00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:21.060
then they picked it up and moved me.
And did the pitch go well?
It went,

431
00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:25.870
it went pretty well.
I kinda was like,
um,
you know,

432
00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.060
I was very naive,

433
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:31.770
a person I think to show business and,

434
00:27:31.771 --> 00:27:35.440
uh,
you know,
I,
uh,

435
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.570
was very,
very confident,
I think,

436
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:43.470
much more confident than,
than I am now actually,
you know,
to be honest with you,

437
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:47.280
because I was naive to the fact that I probably should not be confident,

438
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.920
you know?
Right.
But,
uh,
at that time I did not know that.

439
00:27:49.921 --> 00:27:52.620
Nobody had told me that yet.
So,
you know,
I went a funny,

440
00:27:52.621 --> 00:27:57.060
they'll have that probably had to.
Yeah.
I mean,
and they're like this guy.
Yeah.

441
00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:00.900
Saying I showed up with,
uh,
the,
the,

442
00:28:00.901 --> 00:28:04.650
the executive at MTV would kind of like,
uh,

443
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:08.450
sort of shepherded me in there,
uh,

444
00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:10.800
into this pitch meeting had told me,
okay,

445
00:28:10.801 --> 00:28:14.880
I want you to bring these four clips,
uh,

446
00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.060
painting your parents' House,

447
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.070
plaid painting the car,
you know,

448
00:28:23.071 --> 00:28:27.000
the slut mobile,
right.
Uh,
uh,

449
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:30.380
falling down on crutches on the street.
Uh,

450
00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:34.200
I think go out of the one was when I went into a pharmacy to buy condoms and I

451
00:28:34.201 --> 00:28:34.450
said,
oh,

452
00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:38.370
I also want to play this one where I'm sucking milk out of cows that are dressed

453
00:28:38.371 --> 00:28:42.180
as captain Kirk as amazing.
Yeah.
And they said no.
He said,
no,
don't,

454
00:28:42.181 --> 00:28:43.220
don't play that one.
You,

455
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.170
you can't play that one sucking milk out of cows that are dressed as captain

456
00:28:46.171 --> 00:28:50.910
Kirk.
Oh really?
No,
no,
don't play down.
So literally it's like,

457
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:52.560
you know,
this was pre digital,

458
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:57.030
so he tells me to make a VHS tape and there's gonna be a VHS machine and a walk

459
00:28:57.031 --> 00:28:59.910
in the room,
pitch the show,
but the VHS and play them one at a time.

460
00:28:59.911 --> 00:29:01.230
So I show up with a VHS tape.

461
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:05.400
I of course put the sucking milk cows that are dressed as captain Kirk is the

462
00:29:05.401 --> 00:29:06.234
last video.

463
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:12.710
And so I also brought a suitcase again and Adidas bag actually.

464
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:13.561
And in it,

465
00:29:13.561 --> 00:29:18.561
I had two bottles of shaving cream and a and a towel and basically went in,

466
00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:24.100
pitched the show in front of all these executives,
talked about,
you know,
I,

467
00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:26.760
I did have a serious pitch.
I,
I remember,

468
00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:31.820
I remember it was quite serious about like my understanding of what I was doing.

469
00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:34.800
I mean I,
I did sort of explain to them,
you know,

470
00:29:34.801 --> 00:29:37.650
we're shooting this in a home video camera,
you know,

471
00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:41.740
people don't air stuff shot with a home video camera on television.

472
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.880
It's going to make it more relatable to kids who watch skateboard videos and

473
00:29:45.881 --> 00:29:49.510
stuff.
And I explained,
you know,
sort of my theory behind it.

474
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:54.970
So they saw that I was somewhat rational person,
played all the videos,

475
00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.800
big laughs,
big laughs in the room.

476
00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:01.890
Then I played the last one told them that the executive told me not to play it,

477
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:09.870
played it covering his head.
It got a huge laugh.
People can like,
cause you know,

478
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:14.560
this was like,
this was before,
you know,
uh,
that gross out TV thing is going on.

479
00:30:14.561 --> 00:30:17.590
You know,
it was before like,
you know,
Jack Ass and stuff like that obviously.

480
00:30:17.591 --> 00:30:20.950
But there was some stuff like that.
I mean,
you know,

481
00:30:20.951 --> 00:30:22.510
I mean there was like something about Mary,

482
00:30:22.511 --> 00:30:25.240
I remember when I saw the movie something about Mary,
you know,
with uh,
you know,

483
00:30:25.241 --> 00:30:29.240
the Kinda,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Um,

484
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:32.230
I was kinda like thinking,
wow,
that's pretty shocking,
you know,

485
00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:36.220
so there was still some gross out stuff out there that was before the was on
MTV.

486
00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:39.270
But uh,
but anyway,
so I had the,

487
00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:41.710
the pitch and did and then I,

488
00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:45.010
I for whatever reason thought this would be a good idea.

489
00:30:45.011 --> 00:30:47.530
I went and I laid down on the board room table,

490
00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:51.190
why I'm in front of all of the top executives at MTV,

491
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:55.450
pulled out these two cans of shaving cream and it's covered myself with shaving

492
00:30:55.451 --> 00:30:59.440
cream completely my face and started thrashing around.

493
00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:03.190
Like I used to like to thrash around a lot,
like very violently.

494
00:31:03.191 --> 00:31:05.170
And after a pitch went well after the controlling,

495
00:31:05.171 --> 00:31:09.190
well rushing round I streaming,
I want to be on MTV,

496
00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:10.750
I want to be on MTV.

497
00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:15.780
And then I got up and I some shaving cream off my face and I put a dollop of it

498
00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.770
on the forehead of just the guy who looked like he was in charge.

499
00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:26.260
I just,
the whole room was like,
I mean I was sensing the energy,

500
00:31:26.261 --> 00:31:28.960
like I was getting laughs,
you know,
like everyone was dying,

501
00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:31.210
they couldn't believe this was happening.
And I,
and,

502
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:35.170
and I did that lightly and it was Brian Graydon who was the head of the network

503
00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:39.730
and then I left and got in the elevator and everybody was clapping and laughing

504
00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:42.550
and they called me the next day and said,
yeah,
we're picking up 10 episodes.

505
00:31:42.551 --> 00:31:46.930
You're moving to New York City.
We got you an apartment.
Uh,
you know,

506
00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:50.020
your friends can come with you.
They've,

507
00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:52.190
they brought two of my friends down who were,
you know,

508
00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:56.290
working on the show with me.
She's got them apartments,
apartments,
nice employee,

509
00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:00.640
very nice.
Midtown Manhattan,
right by MTV,

510
00:32:00.641 --> 00:32:02.440
right around the corner.
It was pretty,
it was pretty crazy.

511
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:06.400
There's an excitement to getting an order,
obviously.
Yeah.

512
00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:08.470
But like the way that it hit,

513
00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:12.840
I don't think people now if they miss that that time.
Yeah,

514
00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:18.190
that was definitely,
that kind of feels like that was pre Chappelle show.

515
00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:23.050
It was pre internet.
Really?
Yeah.
That's what it is.
I mean there was,

516
00:32:23.051 --> 00:32:27.850
there was internet,
but there was no video on the Internet.
Right.
So,
you know,

517
00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:31.420
the new thing was people were now downloading music off Napster.

518
00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:35.380
That was the only real access to content on the Internet.
Yeah.
You know,
like,

519
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.050
like audio or video content,
audio content.

520
00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.990
But so the only place you could watch her music videos on much music,

521
00:32:41.991 --> 00:32:45.550
the only place you could watch or I MTV much,

522
00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.970
the only place you could watch.
So everybody watched MTV.
So it was,

523
00:32:49.971 --> 00:32:52.320
it was while I remember it was like,
uh,

524
00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:59.020
like the show basically had been on the air for a week and I don't know if you

525
00:32:59.061 --> 00:33:01.920
remember like MTV,
the play like shows and blocks.

526
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.850
So I didn't know this was going to happen.
They had like five shows on the air.

527
00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:10.100
He was like celebrity deathmatch Daria road rules.

528
00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:16.040
You were on road rules.
Oh yeah,
I forgot.
I forgot.
I,
uh,

529
00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:19.280
as I just
did some research.

530
00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:25.520
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's cool.
Um,
I think you were a little more famous than me.

531
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:29.910
That's cool.
What's been interesting being on,
on road rules,
but,
Jeez.
But,
uh,

532
00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:30.410
so there was,

533
00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:35.410
there was not many shows and then they would run like my show like five times in

534
00:33:36.051 --> 00:33:40.880
a row blocks.
So the show was on like 25 times a week,
30 times a week.

535
00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:45.640
It was the impractical jokers of that time.
Yeah,
it was just all day,
all day.

536
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.860
I never really understood that or was expecting that kind of thing.

537
00:33:48.861 --> 00:33:53.090
But all I know is the thing that was basically the thing that really freaked me

538
00:33:53.091 --> 00:33:55.720
out was about,
I don't know,

539
00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.240
two weeks after the show was on the air,
uh,

540
00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:03.370
got call from Letterman wanted me as to be a guest on the show.
And uh,

541
00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:07.730
then that fell through and I didn't get to go on the show as a guest,

542
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.100
but then I went on like a month later.

543
00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:14.090
So it was like literally like six weeks into the,
into the,
to being,

544
00:34:14.091 --> 00:34:17.840
living in our New York.
I was on who I idolized,
I guys,
Letterman.

545
00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.100
I mean that was my whole,

546
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.830
my whole life was basically revolved around idolizing Letterman,
you know,

547
00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.090
amazing to this of course was so

548
00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:32.720
you can play videos here,
immobile.
So it's,

549
00:34:32.721 --> 00:34:36.180
it's like there's,
there's slept mobile,
so I'm right.

550
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:40.400
So people can see this right now.
Yeah.
Obviously that would be,

551
00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.760
but obviously if you're listening you can't see it.
That's true.
Yeah.

552
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:45.770
But this is on youtube so they can see it on youtube.

553
00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:50.120
So this is like my parents' place when my house I grew up in,

554
00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:54.410
uh,
I lived there,
uh,
at the time I was living there,

555
00:34:54.411 --> 00:34:58.580
I'd move back into their house after college because I didn't have a job for

556
00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:00.380
dads,
just editing videos all day.

557
00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:05.180
Here's my dad going to work and this is work clothes and his trench coat,

558
00:35:05.181 --> 00:35:08.720
he looks like inspector gadget or this briefcase.

559
00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:13.700
And my dad was a military guy,
so he was pretty Canadian military.
You know,

560
00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:17.660
we've got an army and he just starts walking down the street.
Yeah.
But you see,

561
00:35:17.661 --> 00:35:20.300
you start to start to crack up here,
see,

562
00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:24.380
see right around his this moment,
watch his face.
You'll see.

563
00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:29.300
You sort of kind of realizes what are you going,

564
00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:34.530
some effort had been put them right right here.
I think you'll see

565
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:38.040
to there there's,

566
00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:40.950
<v 6>yeah,
it's just,
it's a present.
He just doesn't,
it</v>

567
00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.360
<v 4>quite nice believe</v>

568
00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:48.350
kind of brought it cost me $400 to get it done.

569
00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:54.010
Cost $400.
So it was the most expensive.
We,

570
00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.830
the amount of a bit we'd ever done cause we had to do it.
We bought,

571
00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:02.950
the way we did it was we bought a 1992 Honda accord hood and we,

572
00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:04.383
we painted

573
00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:09.030
head in the middle of the night.

574
00:36:09.031 --> 00:36:13.870
So it's 250 bucks for the hood and like a 150 bucks for the paint jewelry club

575
00:36:13.871 --> 00:36:14.930
or something like that of that.

576
00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:16.740
And then the middle of the night we just swapped it out,

577
00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:21.600
filmed until they got really angry.
And then,
uh,
and then,
uh,
everything was fine.

578
00:36:21.601 --> 00:36:25.320
We swapped it back and I still have the hood now to the status on my wall in my

579
00:36:25.321 --> 00:36:27.810
garage.
Yeah.
Okay.
That's fantastic.

580
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:33.790
The whole way that Tom Green,
not Tom cigarette.
Yeah,
yeah.
No,
no,

581
00:36:33.791 --> 00:36:37.340
not your personality is different.
He's like,
well anyway,

582
00:36:37.341 --> 00:36:40.560
the point is you're so God damn likable,
Tom Green,

583
00:36:40.561 --> 00:36:42.940
when you're doing horrible shit to people,

584
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:48.390
you have this gift of being somehow sweet and charming at the same time and

585
00:36:48.391 --> 00:36:51.150
really rascally Oh,
I was just so fun to watch.

586
00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.940
I feel like that's kind of like part of the,

587
00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:57.450
like when I watch a lot of youtube pranks these days,

588
00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:59.910
some of them go to the place where it's very mean.

589
00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:04.710
And I feel like that's kind of were,
people don't quite understand.

590
00:37:04.711 --> 00:37:06.720
Like that's where you lose the funding,
you know,
it's gotta be,

591
00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.200
it's gotta be unjustified outrage.
Like when people get mad at you,

592
00:37:10.201 --> 00:37:13.710
it's gotta be somewhat unjustified.
In this case,
it's justified,

593
00:37:13.711 --> 00:37:17.040
but because they're my parents different,
it's different.

594
00:37:17.041 --> 00:37:20.400
But if I did that to somebody else who weren't my parents and I didn't have that

595
00:37:20.401 --> 00:37:21.480
relationship,
it would have been,

596
00:37:21.481 --> 00:37:25.380
I would have been being mean by painting their car because they're my parents

597
00:37:25.381 --> 00:37:29.070
and there's,
so there's sort of a,
a sort of a subtle line,

598
00:37:29.071 --> 00:37:30.000
you kind of walk with it.

599
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:34.600
But my favorite part of this bid is like is like the next moment actually if you

600
00:37:34.601 --> 00:37:39.000
play online,
because I did not,
this was not planned,
you know,

601
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:42.520
I figured he was going to get mad and we would,
that would be it.
But then he

602
00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:44.120
<v 6>right at this moment,</v>

603
00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.260
right at this moment,

604
00:37:48.261 --> 00:37:51.530
I realize all my dad's waiting at the bus stop now with all the neighbors.

605
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:53.990
So then I follow.
Right.
And so that ended,

606
00:37:53.991 --> 00:37:56.240
this ends up being kind of like the funniest part of the bit.

607
00:37:56.241 --> 00:37:57.640
Really just let me end,

608
00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:02.650
let's talk to me to work so hard to make everybody get in that box all night

609
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:08.510
long.
My mom has no intention of talking to me.
It's pretty graphic too.

610
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.250
It's like there's not a lot left to the imagination

611
00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.300
and it was,
let's look further ahead.
But anyway,
we'd go to the bus,
stop dropping

612
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:20.010
<v 7>to our car,</v>

613
00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.820
Moody's video effects to

614
00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:30.980
check where mom

615
00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:36.220
is making me sick and I

616
00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:39.580
<v 4>gene,
it's love</v>

617
00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:43.390
<v 6>those women on Love Dad,
Oh dad can take the bus to work.</v>

618
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:44.990
I'm going to take the slut Moby over the

619
00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.500
looking at all my neighbors.

620
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:57.440
It's
just

621
00:38:59.110 --> 00:38:59.943
their faces,

622
00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.200
first of all,

623
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:12.633
lesbians,

624
00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:19.170
Lesbians and slots.
That's what I thought.
It would be a nice

625
00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:27.160
whether or not it was funny or not.
I thought you liked that kind of thing.

626
00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:32.920
What does that even mean?
That aside.
Now I know you don't like lesbians

627
00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:36.240
don't want them on my car.

628
00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.410
So it's not that you have a problem with lesbian stuff?

629
00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:50.430
<v 4>No,
no.
I have a younger brother yet.
And what,
what was he,
what's he like?
Uh,</v>

630
00:39:50.431 --> 00:39:51.780
he's uh,
he,
he's,

631
00:39:51.781 --> 00:39:56.000
he's little bit more calm and reserved.

632
00:39:56.190 --> 00:40:01.140
Was the aftermath of like camera's off the next time you see them after the

633
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:06.360
automobile.
So,
well,
the aftermath and were those the answering machine messages?

634
00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:07.830
Those were coming in?

635
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:13.400
So basically what happened was we left the car park there and we didn't do

636
00:40:14.341 --> 00:40:16.000
anything for awhile,
but I didn't,

637
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:19.680
we didn't reveal to them right away that we had the hood that we could switch.

638
00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:22.530
You say a while a week?
No,
like,
like,
like

639
00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:28.530
eight hours.
Okay.
And My mother was leaving these answering machine messages.

640
00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:32.530
You remember this,
this is also,
we didn't have cell phones then either.
Right?

641
00:40:32.531 --> 00:40:37.050
Right,
right.
This is like literally primitive days.
So,

642
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:42.200
but she would call my landline that I had my own personal landline and leave a

643
00:40:42.571 --> 00:40:44.160
voice message and I would listen to it.

644
00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:48.270
I remember how the world worked then like you would kind of,

645
00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:54.060
I mean memorize phone numbers.
That was how you stayed in touch with people.

646
00:40:54.061 --> 00:40:58.740
Like if I left,
I knew my mother wanted to talk to me.
I didn't have a cell phone.

647
00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:01.560
So I would go to a payphone,
put a quarter in it,

648
00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:06.750
call my voicemail and check if my mother had called and left an angry message.

649
00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:09.930
Sure enough she had and then a call 10 minutes later and she'd left another one

650
00:41:09.931 --> 00:41:12.220
and another one.
And so as the day went on,
she left five and,

651
00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:13.560
and I was sitting there,
you know,

652
00:41:13.561 --> 00:41:17.910
with my friends who were sort of wrote the show together and we're thinking,

653
00:41:17.911 --> 00:41:21.840
well we can't,
we can't go tell her that the hoods,
you know,

654
00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:25.610
and then we can fix it right away until she stops leaving these awesome
messages.

655
00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:27.030
Yeah.
Not too good.
Yeah.

656
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:30.120
So we just kind of waited and she was really mad because her,

657
00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:34.550
her mother and her sister coming to visit that day.

658
00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:39.320
So she was terrified that they were going to see this on the slap mobile,

659
00:41:39.321 --> 00:41:42.950
you know,
so,
so,
uh,
yeah.

660
00:41:42.951 --> 00:41:46.880
Then sort of put her out of her misery at the end of the day and just went and

661
00:41:46.881 --> 00:41:49.020
took the car up to the shop and swept the hood out and

662
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:56.930
eight hours making people freak.
I'd given within 20 minutes.
I'm just kidding.

663
00:41:56.931 --> 00:42:00.950
I'm kidding.
Yeah,
it was,
it was kind of a,

664
00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:03.550
yeah,
it was,
it was,
it was,

665
00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:09.200
I kind of have this relationship with my parents were joking like that.

666
00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:14.990
Like it was kind of a kind of acceptable,
I mean,
like they,

667
00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.440
I could tell they thought it was,
they would watch the show every week,

668
00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:21.980
so it would,
so the show aired live,

669
00:42:21.981 --> 00:42:26.981
it was live on Thursday night on his public access station called Rogers Cable

670
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.880
and in Ottawa.

671
00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:33.940
So every Thursday night I would run around all week and film these clips and

672
00:42:34.161 --> 00:42:39.161
Thursday night I'd go sit in a studio and we go live and we sprayed the clips

673
00:42:39.351 --> 00:42:43.130
back and I'd have it local guests on and things like that.
But,
um,

674
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:44.450
they would watch,
you know,
so,

675
00:42:44.451 --> 00:42:48.470
and they would always kind of laugh at themselves afterwards,

676
00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.090
but it was just sort of in the,

677
00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:52.670
so we had to kind of up the ante a little bit every time.

678
00:42:52.671 --> 00:42:57.620
Did your dad laugh eventually about that incident?
Oh yeah,
sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.

679
00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:02.630
I mean they,
they,
they did.
And uh,
I mean it kind of,
it kind of,
uh,

680
00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:06.230
so the,
the,
the,

681
00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:11.260
we went to New York and they thought the pranks were done and that we had this

682
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:14.150
prop budget now from MTV.

683
00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:18.110
And I flew back to Canada without telling them that I was coming back.

684
00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:24.200
We had the MTV
prop department come with us,

685
00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:25.101
prop designers,

686
00:43:25.101 --> 00:43:28.040
we look food back to Ottawa with like a crew of like 12 people or something like

687
00:43:28.041 --> 00:43:29.990
that without telling my parents I was back in town,

688
00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.800
we were there for a few days without my parents even knowing was there,

689
00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:38.420
built these uh,
statues of my parents having sex

690
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:44.840
out of like,
you know,
plaster and stuff like that were really,

691
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:49.760
I think they cost like $5,000 to me or something like that.
Got MTV money,

692
00:43:49.761 --> 00:43:54.120
you know,
and put them on the front lawn of their house and you know,

693
00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:58.820
there was like a hose running up my dad's leg and water squirting out to where

694
00:43:58.821 --> 00:44:02.630
it's supposed to and you know,
all over.
And um,

695
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:07.220
they were furious about that one.
So that was the line that across into

696
00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:12.740
a lawsuit type of,
we talked about lawsuit,

697
00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:17.330
like that was the first time it got to that place where we got back to New York.

698
00:44:17.331 --> 00:44:20.270
They called it left a message on the answering machine answering machine.

699
00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:23.500
They had an answering machine at MTV,
they left a message saying,
you know,
if,

700
00:44:23.501 --> 00:44:27.080
if you,
if you,
my dad said a,
what was it?
He said,

701
00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:31.980
if you ere that clip,
we're to sue you.

702
00:44:31.981 --> 00:44:36.981
MTV bastards for $1 million was this will allow and um,

703
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:40.500
and uh,
was this threat.
And uh,

704
00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:44.430
so MTV said I couldn't air the clip.
This was all like the first,

705
00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:45.880
<v 8>okay.</v>

706
00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:49.000
<v 4>Couple of months of doing the show.
And uh,</v>

707
00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:53.980
I wasn't allowed to air that clip of the sec statues and MTV wasn't gonna let me

708
00:44:53.981 --> 00:44:56.530
hear it unless my parents signed a release form.
My parents were like,

709
00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:00.130
literally my mother was not talking to me.
And like right when that happened,

710
00:45:00.131 --> 00:45:04.960
I told them,
I told the story a few times,
but not,
not too many times,
but like,

711
00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:10.450
so I don't know if I've ever told you the story about the right before.
Um,

712
00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:16.540
uh,
you know,
my mother was not talking to me and they were literally,

713
00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:20.290
I actually think they were considering some sort of legal thing cause my,

714
00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:24.550
I didn't realize like my mother is kind of conservative.
Like,

715
00:45:24.551 --> 00:45:28.740
I didn't realize that.
And so,
no,

716
00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:31.140
I had been doing these pranks for a few years now,

717
00:45:31.141 --> 00:45:36.141
but it was this sort of the sexual undertone or overt sexual nature of the bit

718
00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:41.190
that really,
really embarrassed her,
you know?
And she was really,
really,

719
00:45:41.191 --> 00:45:45.210
really mad and upset.
Um,
and I felt bad.

720
00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:49.650
Uh,
but it was hilarious.
The bit was hilarious.
I mean,
it really was hilarious.

721
00:45:49.651 --> 00:45:53.030
So I did want to air it and I kind of felt like my mother was overreacting

722
00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:56.560
because like,
you know,
it's just,
it's just a statue.
You know what I mean?

723
00:45:56.570 --> 00:46:00.270
It's not,
it's fine.
But,
um,
so,
uh,

724
00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:05.430
if things are getting really bad and then it was the weirdest timing,
but,

725
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:08.940
and this is how we're,
the show was sort of,
to talk about how weird it was.

726
00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:14.010
Oprah calls the show and wants to book my parents and I on her mother's Day

727
00:46:14.011 --> 00:46:17.610
special,
I,
so I called my mother,

728
00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:21.810
been living in New York for maybe two months.
She's not talking to me,

729
00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:26.250
my dad,
I say,
God put mom on the phone.
Let me let her listen.
I say,

730
00:46:26.251 --> 00:46:29.330
Oprah wants us to go on a mother's Day special,
you know,

731
00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.630
did she wants to play the slot immobile,
she wants to play painting the house,

732
00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:35.700
you know,
and,
uh,

733
00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:39.480
and she's got this whole plan to apologize to you guys on my behalf.

734
00:46:39.481 --> 00:46:43.950
And so although she,
she of course was very impressed,
you know,

735
00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:48.270
everybody's mom loves Oprah,
right?
Yeah.
So we flew to Chicago,
did the show.

736
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:53.390
Oprah then surprises me and them and gives them a all expenses paid two week

737
00:46:56.130 --> 00:47:00.960
cruise to Tahiti.
Okay.
The whole audience,
you know,
cheers.
Like,

738
00:47:00.961 --> 00:47:05.490
you know,
once she gives away stuff and then,
uh,
and then,
um,
that's cool.

739
00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.380
And then that night at dinner,
uh,
you know,

740
00:47:07.381 --> 00:47:12.300
I pulled the release form out of my back pocket.
They signed and,
uh,

741
00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:16.830
the Sec statue bet aired on MTV.
That's all.

742
00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:21.660
It's a thank you Oprah.
Thank you very much.
Yeah.
Oh,
bro.
Yeah.
But,

743
00:47:21.661 --> 00:47:26.550
um,
yeah.
So,
yeah,
those were crazy times,
but,
you know,
I guess it was,

744
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:29.040
you know,
look,
I mean,
I mean,
it was a,

745
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:33.790
it was a very strange time because,
you know,

746
00:47:33.791 --> 00:47:36.960
uh,
you know,
I,

747
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:41.890
I sometimes admit like,
you know,
I try,
I'm trying to find an ex,

748
00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:42.910
well,
Mr. Holmes,

749
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:47.440
I'm trying to find a way to like talk about my feelings about that period

750
00:47:47.441 --> 00:47:49.030
because,
you know,
you know,
I don't know if,

751
00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:53.230
I don't know if you have regrets in life,
you know,
you know,
I mean,
I,
I've,
I've,

752
00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:57.490
I've started like hearing people talk about like,
Oh,
you know,
uh,

753
00:47:57.550 --> 00:48:02.380
don't have regrets because every failure is actually something that you learn

754
00:48:02.381 --> 00:48:07.240
from and then you learn from that and that makes you who you are and all that.

755
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:11.980
So start trying to like,
tell myself that and like,
you know,
but,
um,
but you know,

756
00:48:11.981 --> 00:48:14.710
like it is kind of a mind fuck,
you know,
like,

757
00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:18.640
like going through that because sure.
All of a sudden you're thinking,
okay,
shit,

758
00:48:18.641 --> 00:48:20.650
like,
you know,

759
00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:25.090
I'm going to Oprah and Letterman and uh,
you know,

760
00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:28.960
they asked me to host Saturday night live,
right.
I'm,
I was directing my movie.

761
00:48:28.961 --> 00:48:33.640
Freddy got fingered.
Yeah.
And,
uh,
that I wrote,
I'd never written a movie,
you know,

762
00:48:33.641 --> 00:48:36.520
I don't know,
read a movie,
but for some reason,
like I thought,
oh,

763
00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:42.300
I'm going to write a movie as opposed to go do a perfectly good movie than other

764
00:48:42.491 --> 00:48:47.491
people who are professional movie writers make that are asking me to do.

765
00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:48.461
And I'm like,

766
00:48:48.461 --> 00:48:52.690
so like naive and like overconfident that I'm actually going to myself,

767
00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:57.940
oh no,
no,
no,
I don't want to do your movie that's like professional and like,

768
00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:00.760
you know,
made and like really,

769
00:49:00.761 --> 00:49:05.180
really good because that's not my kind of comedy.
You know,
I,

770
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:08.800
I doing something different here and then me and my friends sit down in a room

771
00:49:08.801 --> 00:49:11.950
with absolutely no knowledge of how to write a movie,
right.
And Go,

772
00:49:11.951 --> 00:49:14.470
we're going to make the craziest fucking movie ever made.
Right.

773
00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:18.310
And so we go to this movie and you sort of,
you know,

774
00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:23.820
are running on this sort of like adrenaline excitement and a,

775
00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:28.060
and a bit of like kind of fear cause you're kind of go like shit.

776
00:49:28.061 --> 00:49:32.350
Like I hope nobody like figures out that I actually don't know how to make a

777
00:49:32.351 --> 00:49:35.080
movie.
Of course they did.
There were making it in,

778
00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:39.230
are you saying that that's your regret then?
No,
I think,
I think I like,

779
00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:41.650
so I think to myself sometimes I think like,
okay,

780
00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:47.370
if I had been less naive maybe I would have done things differently and who

781
00:49:48.761 --> 00:49:53.200
knows what would have,
would have been different,
you know,
like,
you know,
but uh,

782
00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:56.170
but uh,
you know,
I think,
I think I would've,

783
00:49:56.290 --> 00:50:00.360
I wish I could have just sort of gone with the flow a little bit more at some

784
00:50:00.361 --> 00:50:04.270
times.
Like when I hosted Saturday night live,
you know,

785
00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:08.170
there was a bit of like,
I don't know if you'd call it controversy,

786
00:50:08.171 --> 00:50:11.920
but there's some people were kind of like,
you know,
kind of,
I dunno,

787
00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:16.670
little pissed at me over there I think.
And because of your status.
Well,

788
00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:21.730
no,
what happened was I went to Saturday night live and I thought,
okay,
well I,

789
00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:26.760
my friend Derrick and my friend Shawn friends from high school and their writers

790
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:31.970
on the show,
you know,
we're all friends,
we're not really writers.
You know,

791
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.950
we're calling ourselves writers now,
but you know,

792
00:50:33.951 --> 00:50:36.590
we're not really writers at the time now.
Now they are writers.
Actually,

793
00:50:36.591 --> 00:50:41.060
they could go,
both got big careers as writers in television up in Canada.
And,

794
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:43.700
but at the time we weren't really writers,

795
00:50:43.701 --> 00:50:47.390
we were just friends and we started the show and everything was going great.

796
00:50:47.391 --> 00:50:49.820
And Saturday night live asked me to come host it.

797
00:50:49.821 --> 00:50:53.930
And I'm like completely like flabbergasted that I'm getting to host Saturday

798
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:58.220
night live and nervous as shit about it,
you know.
And then I say,
uh,

799
00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:01.370
I say to,
you know,
Saturday night live,
I say,

800
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:03.350
is it all right if my friends come

801
00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:04.720
<v 9>okay?</v>

802
00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:09.220
<v 4>And helped me write some clips,
some bits for the show saw?
They're like,
yeah,</v>

803
00:51:09.221 --> 00:51:14.220
sure.
So the open up a little office and uh,

804
00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:16.900
for my two friends and I,
and we go down,

805
00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:20.060
this is not what you're supposed to do though when you host Saturday night live,

806
00:51:20.061 --> 00:51:25.061
if you're supposed to go down and be friends with everybody and go meet with all

807
00:51:25.901 --> 00:51:29.680
the writers and,
and,
and do the bets.
But I had decided in my head like,
oh no,

808
00:51:29.681 --> 00:51:32.920
we're gonna make it a crazy episode of Saturday night live,
you know?
Right.

809
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:36.580
And so I thought everybody would think that that was really cool.

810
00:51:36.581 --> 00:51:38.690
But I guess some people thought like that.
I was like,

811
00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:41.740
like kind of being disrespectful or something like that.
Yeah.

812
00:51:41.741 --> 00:51:44.440
But as I want it to make this show like really,
really crazy,
you know?

813
00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:47.500
That's who you are though.
Yeah.
You do.
I think to myself,
oh,

814
00:51:47.501 --> 00:51:50.650
maybe it would have been better if I just went in and did the sketches that they

815
00:51:50.651 --> 00:51:53.120
wrote and,
and sat and had fun.
You do none of the sketches.

816
00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:57.910
I did quite a few of them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I did also,
like,

817
00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:01.840
we also wrote a bunch of sketches that they let go on the air and they were like

818
00:52:01.841 --> 00:52:03.970
really fucking weird sketches,
you know what I mean?
Like,

819
00:52:03.971 --> 00:52:05.770
I don't even know if they were actually considered,

820
00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:09.150
could be considered sketches to be honest with you.
Like it was like,
you know,

821
00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:13.450
you know,
one was a mean will Farrell dressed up as eagles.

822
00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:18.300
And,
uh,
we're in front of a green screen and there's like a,

823
00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:23.320
an eagle's nest behind us and we're in these elaborate eagle costumes and,

824
00:52:24.551 --> 00:52:27.470
uh,
Jimmy Fallon has at on the stage,
you know,

825
00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:30.970
with another green screen and he's looking through binoculars at the eagles and

826
00:52:30.971 --> 00:52:34.420
then it cuts to us as the eagles.
And then we basically,
you know,

827
00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:40.300
like fly up into the audience and we'd go up into the audience and then we like

828
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:43.750
chew up carrots and like split them into each other's mouths or something like

829
00:52:43.751 --> 00:52:48.160
that,
you know?
Yeah.
But I mean,
a lot of that I'm on board.
Let's do it.
Yeah.
So,

830
00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:50.950
you know,
it was weird shit like that.
And,
uh,

831
00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:54.040
so then another thing that happened was,
okay,
so

832
00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:55.720
<v 9>yeah,</v>

833
00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:59.320
<v 4>you do a rehearsal show and um,
and uh,</v>

834
00:52:59.950 --> 00:53:03.400
they do a bunch of sketches that don't end up on the actual show.

835
00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:05.480
<v 9>Okay.</v>

836
00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:05.830
<v 4>Uh,</v>

837
00:53:05.830 --> 00:53:10.570
cause you know you do more sketches and so I'm one of the sketches in the

838
00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:15.490
rehearsal show was um,
oh shit,
I just forgot what I was going to say.
There's,

839
00:53:15.491 --> 00:53:19.570
there's,
there's a,
there was some sketch we did in the,

840
00:53:19.571 --> 00:53:21.460
in the rehearsal show that was just really,

841
00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:23.440
<v 9>yeah</v>

842
00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:28.320
<v 4>it got cut.
There's this,
there's a lot of stories about the shoulder.</v>

843
00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:32.690
I had a major mental block there.
Right?
There come,
it'll come.
Yeah.

844
00:53:33.550 --> 00:53:34.650
No I hear you.

845
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:39.660
But I think part of your success and the fact that you're a pioneer doing this

846
00:53:39.661 --> 00:53:40.040
stuff,

847
00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:45.040
it is your ability to be so tunnel vision and to really see and know what you

848
00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:46.140
were great at.

849
00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:49.530
I think my mental block just now was I started feeling weird talking about

850
00:53:49.531 --> 00:53:53.950
myself.
Oh.
Oh well we're loving way.
Love it.
That's the point of this

851
00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:59.970
podcast.
I'm here to talk about myself dying to hear this.

852
00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:04.650
They love,
I get self conscious sometimes cause you know,
it's like,
you know,

853
00:54:04.651 --> 00:54:06.580
fuck off buddy.
No

854
00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:13.840
talking about himself.
But like,
you know,
it was um,
yeah,
it was a

855
00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.800
one sketch.
Let me,
let me,
let me tell you a couple of schedule themselves.

856
00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:21.860
One sketch was I want to see this SNL episode.

857
00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:27.250
There was one sketch where I get in a bathtub with Lorne Michaels and they had

858
00:54:28.281 --> 00:54:29.114
like,

859
00:54:29.810 --> 00:54:30.643
<v 9>uh,</v>

860
00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:33.260
<v 4>a sketch written for us.
This was pre-taped sketch.</v>

861
00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:35.310
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

862
00:54:35.310 --> 00:54:40.020
<v 4>And uh,
so we did the sketch and then when the sketch was done,</v>

863
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:44.970
I said to Lorne Michaels,
uh,
Lauren,
can I try improvising something?

864
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:47.580
This is a pre tape,
right.
And saw everyone's all nervous on the set too.

865
00:54:47.581 --> 00:54:51.120
It's all quiet and sort of,
everyone's was pretty tense on the set over there.

866
00:54:51.121 --> 00:54:55.830
For some reason I'm very serious.
And uh,
he was like,
oh,
okay,

867
00:54:55.831 --> 00:54:59.300
sure Tom.
So I look,
do this.
I just basically start thrashing around.

868
00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:02.750
There was no sketch.
I just start thrashing or there was a rubber ducky,
ducky,

869
00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:06.780
ducky,
ducky,
ducky,
ducky,
ducky,
Ducky,
ducky,
splashing,
water splashing.

870
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:10.300
And I go on and on and on and on.
And then I just stopped.
And then Lauren goes,

871
00:55:10.650 --> 00:55:13.410
Lauren had some line that he threw out there and was killed.

872
00:55:13.411 --> 00:55:16.020
He had a funny line of sort of making fun of me for being an idiot.

873
00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:18.510
And then that that ended up running,
you know?

874
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:23.870
So then I guess some of the writers who wrote the sketch that didn't like end up

875
00:55:24.661 --> 00:55:27.540
actually running because of this thing that I improvised.

876
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:30.420
I just think people started getting like kind of like bummed that I was like

877
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:34.380
running around trying to do and all this.
Yeah.
Improvising and shit.
You know,

878
00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:38.040
people get precious about it.
Yeah.
I mean that's all I remember the,

879
00:55:38.041 --> 00:55:42.060
I remember the story that I'm a,
I hear this story I was going to tell when,
um,

880
00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:47.070
when I got self conscious about talking about myself too much and forgot what

881
00:55:47.071 --> 00:55:50.250
the story was.
So there's a,
in the rehearsal show,

882
00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:53.293
<v 9>uh,</v>

883
00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:57.160
<v 4>this show,
the sketch actually ended up bearing and the rehearsal show,</v>

884
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:59.320
there was a sketch where I play a wizard.

885
00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:04.240
This was one of the ones that they wrote.
It was will Ferrell,
Molly,

886
00:56:04.241 --> 00:56:06.850
Shannon and myself and I'm a wizard,

887
00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:08.980
I think we're all wizards or something like that.

888
00:56:10.030 --> 00:56:13.630
And for whatever reason they have me holding a potbelly pig,
live potbelly pig.

889
00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:15.183
And um,

890
00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:16.550
<v 9>okay</v>

891
00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:18.260
<v 4>I have like one line in the sketch.</v>

892
00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:19.700
<v 9>Okay.</v>

893
00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:24.670
<v 4>A couple of lines and then welfare,
let's rub a monologue for will.
And um,</v>

894
00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:30.090
I noticed in that rehearsal show that like if you hold the pig and your finger

895
00:56:30.191 --> 00:56:34.360
to sort of lightly grazes at stomach,
it starts squealing like a,

896
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:37.950
like a maniac.
Like it's the craziest and the,

897
00:56:37.951 --> 00:56:41.560
and the trainer comes up and says,
oh don't,
don't touch it.
Stomach it.

898
00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:45.460
They go crazy when they do that.
And I mean it's like literally sounds like,

899
00:56:45.461 --> 00:56:46.450
you know,
you know,

900
00:56:46.451 --> 00:56:50.320
it sounds like it's not doing well but it doesn't hurt it or anything like that.

901
00:56:50.321 --> 00:56:51.154
But it's like,

902
00:56:58.030 --> 00:57:02.440
like really crazy and really loud here.
So I go like note to self,

903
00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:07.990
don't do that in the rehearsal show.
Save it for the,
yeah.
Cause I'm like,

904
00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:11.680
I like when things go wrong on television.
Sure.
And you know,

905
00:57:11.681 --> 00:57:13.330
I don't think they liked that at Saturday night.

906
00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:16.600
I like it when things get a little like fucked up.
Right.
Yeah.

907
00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:20.770
Cause to me that's when like you sort of see like,
you know,
you know,
some,

908
00:57:20.771 --> 00:57:22.090
some confusion and stuff.

909
00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:26.610
So then there's the live show happens when we go on and,
and you know,

910
00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:30.280
of course the sketch starts and I immediately began to sort of lightly caressing

911
00:57:30.281 --> 00:57:32.360
her stomach and the thing just screams through the,

912
00:57:32.361 --> 00:57:34.540
and we're alive and things screamed through the whole,

913
00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:38.400
the whole a sketch and um,
you know,

914
00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:41.710
I mean I thought it was pretty funny,
but,
uh,
I don't know if they,

915
00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:45.760
I don't know if they liked that too much.
Um,
I don't know if,

916
00:57:45.790 --> 00:57:47.260
I don't know if they liked that too much.

917
00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:49.330
And so like I kind of like when I say like,
Oh,

918
00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:54.040
I have some regrets and because I was naive,
right?
Yeah.
So now,
you know,

919
00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:57.730
20 years later or whatever,
18 years later,
whatever it is,
you know,

920
00:57:58.150 --> 00:58:00.070
I look back and go like,
oh,
you know,

921
00:58:00.071 --> 00:58:03.340
maybe I shouldn't have been a shit disturber there in that moment because like

922
00:58:03.341 --> 00:58:06.730
maybe you know,
like,
you know,
people like,
you know,

923
00:58:06.731 --> 00:58:10.620
think I'm an asshole or something like that.
Cause I made the pig squeal when,

924
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:14.320
you know,
uh,
so,
you know,
it's like,
you know,
you know,
things like that.

925
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:15.680
But I also feel like

926
00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:16.970
<v 0>that's,
I mean,</v>

927
00:58:17.090 --> 00:58:22.040
what you're talking about too is just like comes with age and maturing and you,

928
00:58:22.070 --> 00:58:25.400
you know,
you having the perspective you have now.
Yeah.
It just,

929
00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:29.030
it doesn't make sense then.
No,
I say fuck him.
Tom Green.
Yeah.

930
00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:32.180
You did the right thing.
You know why that was your brand.

931
00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:34.640
That's who they fucking hired.
That's the,

932
00:58:34.641 --> 00:58:38.390
that was your thing when you went in being you to 100%.

933
00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:41.230
You know what I mean?
I think he knew what they were.
Yeah.

934
00:58:41.290 --> 00:58:43.990
<v 4>Getting you mentioned in your email when you invited me that you thought it was</v>

935
00:58:43.991 --> 00:58:47.290
a nice person.
Nice.
So,
you know,
I appreciate that.

936
00:58:47.291 --> 00:58:52.291
But I think part of the reason why I'm a nice person is because maybe I feel

937
00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:56.950
like I have to compensate for maybe haven't been an asshole at some point.

938
00:58:56.951 --> 00:58:59.470
You know,
like when I was younger,
like maybe,
you know,

939
00:58:59.471 --> 00:59:02.800
maybe when I made that pig squeal and fucked up that sketch,

940
00:59:02.801 --> 00:59:06.340
like maybe I shouldn't have done that.
Maybe I'd better be nice to people.

941
00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:08.030
And I learned from that.

942
00:59:08.330 --> 00:59:10.850
<v 0>Do you think that people have that?
Um,
you know,</v>

943
00:59:10.851 --> 00:59:15.410
from watching the sketches and knowing your persona that there's a little,

944
00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:18.560
they have a little bit of apprehension or fear like,

945
00:59:18.561 --> 00:59:21.590
is this guy going to be a dick?
[inaudible] fuck with me.
They do.
Right.

946
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:22.160
I think so.

947
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:25.100
<v 4>Yeah.
Yeah.
It took me while to figure that out.</v>

948
00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:29.600
Cause sometimes I thought sometimes I perceive it as like people might not like

949
00:59:29.601 --> 00:59:30.530
me or something,
but then,

950
00:59:30.531 --> 00:59:33.140
then I think maybe they're just worried that I'm going to pull a dead raccoon

951
00:59:33.141 --> 00:59:37.180
out of my pants and throw it on him or something like that.
So,
yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

952
00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:40.790
I mean,
I get very nervous around,
you know,

953
00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:44.900
people that I,
you know,
I get nervous when I meet you guys,
you know,

954
00:59:44.901 --> 00:59:48.070
for the first time I'm looking at what I'm said,
what am I going to say?
You know?

955
00:59:48.110 --> 00:59:51.610
Yeah.
And I get nervous when I go to the comedy store and,
and you know,

956
00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:56.150
you're backstage and there's,
oh,
David spades going on,
you know,
and I'm like,

957
00:59:56.151 --> 00:59:59.000
oh my God.
Like there's David spade right there.
You know,
I'm kind of nervous,

958
00:59:59.001 --> 01:00:02.990
you know?
Sure.
You know,
so,
and that doesn't really go away.
I did this,
you know,

959
01:00:02.991 --> 01:00:05.870
Internet show,
you know,
like this,
uh,

960
01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:10.960
for years in my living room a few years ago and interviewed tons of people.

961
01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:14.270
And I honestly think I kind of stopped doing it because it was,

962
01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:17.720
I had too much anxiety about having to meet the people that were coming up.

963
01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:21.500
I'd be like,
Oh shit,
we invited val Kilmer and he's coming,

964
01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:25.650
I'm going to have to sit with val Kilmer for now.
Oh my God,
I don't,

965
01:00:25.651 --> 01:00:27.020
what the fuck am I going to do?
You know?

966
01:00:27.021 --> 01:00:30.270
And then I'd let it up having anxiety about it all week.
Yeah.
You know,

967
01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:34.070
so I just kind of like,
now I just,
my podcast,
I just walk around,
you know,

968
01:00:34.071 --> 01:00:36.690
just talking to a microphone by myself.
Yeah.

969
01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:40.820
I don't know.
I'm just throwing it out there.

970
01:00:40.821 --> 01:00:45.660
Do you think that that's why maybe you would soda,
you know,
attack,

971
01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:50.960
not attack people,
but you're the one that kind of threw out that to prevent?

972
01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:55.750
I think I had,
I think I definitely have sort of a,
you know,
when,

973
01:00:55.810 --> 01:00:59.990
when you,
when I was a kid I was like super skinny kid,
you know,
we were,

974
01:00:59.991 --> 01:01:04.040
I was an army brat,
so we moved every year.
I was always very insecure about,

975
01:01:04.041 --> 01:01:05.060
you know,
myself.

976
01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:08.270
And I think that was sort of my self defense mechanism was like trying to be

977
01:01:08.271 --> 01:01:11.690
like outrageous and,
and you know like,
Oh,
you know,

978
01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:16.070
you can't make fun of me in the hallway because I just crashed into a garbage

979
01:01:16.071 --> 01:01:19.710
can and like,
you know,
you know,
fell into a bookshelf,
you know,

980
01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:22.100
and obviously I did it on purpose.

981
01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:25.860
So now you can't make fun of kind of make fun of me hitting me an idiot because

982
01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:30.550
clearly I'm trying to be an idiot.
Yeah.
So I mean,

983
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:32.940
moving does that,
I remember I moved a lot as a kid too.

984
01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:37.970
Especially like when you start to come into,
you know,

985
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:43.430
that like 12,
13,
14 year old age,
why did you move so much?
Born in Cincinnati,

986
01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:45.920
we moved a lot when you were in Florida,

987
01:01:45.921 --> 01:01:50.921
you were in Minneapolis and blocky and different schools sometimes within those

988
01:01:51.081 --> 01:01:52.670
cities.
You know,
why didn't you move so much though?

989
01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:57.640
My Dad was just getting a promoted within the company he was working in.
Okay.

990
01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:02.480
And so they would just,
you know,
he would just,
we would just move.
But Yeah,
God,

991
01:02:02.481 --> 01:02:07.130
those,
those,
I like those feelings resonate with me about being,

992
01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.520
moving around and,
and the older I got,
I feel like the harder those moves where,

993
01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:16.610
you know,
we moved middle of my freshman year of high school.
See,
we stopped,

994
01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:20.010
I stopped moving when I was seven,
so,
oh yeah,
we moved to Ottawa when

995
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:22.110
<v 5>I was seven and then I stayed there.
So yeah.</v>

996
01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:26.520
So I just moved every year before that,
before that first grade,
second grade.

997
01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:30.150
Oh my God.
How do you feel then we got,
we almost tabbed on this earlier,

998
01:02:30.151 --> 01:02:31.090
but how do you feel about it?

999
01:02:31.091 --> 01:02:36.091
Cause I do feel like you really laid the groundwork for us certain style of

1000
01:02:38.341 --> 01:02:42.600
comedy that I feel like is very much yours,
you know?
Um,
when you,

1001
01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:47.190
do you feel like sometimes you're like,
oh,
this person's doing kind of my thing.

1002
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:48.833
Like,

1003
01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:49.830
<v 9>okay.</v>

1004
01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:52.050
<v 4>Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
I,
I mean I,</v>

1005
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:55.710
I honestly like does it feel cool?
They're like,
you're getting,

1006
01:02:56.550 --> 01:03:01.170
it's a tough one to answer because like,
I know everybody.
Yeah.
And you know,

1007
01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:05.070
everybody that does it blatantly,
you know,

1008
01:03:05.071 --> 01:03:09.960
has expressed to me that they're fans of mine and I'm fans of theirs too.

1009
01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:14.190
Yeah.
And we're friends.
Um,
and I get asked about this,
you know,

1010
01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:16.410
when I do press,
when I'm on the road,

1011
01:03:16.411 --> 01:03:19.500
are people asking you about all the shows and

1012
01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:21.953
you know,

1013
01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:23.773
<v 9>okay,</v>

1014
01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:27.340
<v 4>I have a problem with it.
When they do the exact bit,</v>

1015
01:03:27.550 --> 01:03:32.530
the I doing the same bid and there's a lot of people that have done every one of

1016
01:03:32.531 --> 01:03:36.820
my bits.
There's a few,
there's a couple of shows,
big shows everyone knows,

1017
01:03:36.821 --> 01:03:40.270
probably won't talking about.
They've done every single one of my bits,

1018
01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:43.380
like the exact bid,
like painted the parent's house,
you know,

1019
01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:46.030
put the animals in the house,
you know,
you know,

1020
01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:48.290
went out and pretend to they were,
you know,
so.

1021
01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:53.470
So when I see them doing the exact bit for me it's,
it's a little hard to,

1022
01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:57.130
that's not paying on mine because it's like I go like,

1023
01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:58.890
I remember when we came up with that,

1024
01:03:58.910 --> 01:04:02.920
my friends and I came up with painting my parents' house and thinking herself,

1025
01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:06.990
Okay Shit.
Like no one's ever fucking done that before.
Yeah.

1026
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.660
Painted their parents house and filmed it and got their reactions.

1027
01:04:09.690 --> 01:04:11.130
Like no one's ever done that before.
Like,

1028
01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:16.090
so we were always trying to come up with things that nobody had ever done
before.

1029
01:04:16.091 --> 01:04:19.100
That was literally the mantra.
Like,
we're looking,
you know,
look for,
you know,

1030
01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:21.970
like sucking milk out of a cow's udder for instance.

1031
01:04:21.971 --> 01:04:26.800
Not something like that is probably one of my cleverest bits,
but,
you know,

1032
01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:32.080
no,
I saw somebody big show last week on Instagram doing that and I'm like,

1033
01:04:32.110 --> 01:04:33.700
exactly.
You know,
I'm like,
oh,
okay,

1034
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:37.180
lets you know if you want to do that exact bit,
that's fine.

1035
01:04:37.181 --> 01:04:41.890
But I feel it's a little bit,
uh,
a little bit weird.

1036
01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:46.510
Yeah.
That's a little odd.
It's like everybody gets really,

1037
01:04:46.511 --> 01:04:51.340
really uptight in stand up when somebody's like,
you know,
oh,

1038
01:04:51.341 --> 01:04:54.670
they both did a bit about like landlines.
You know what I mean?

1039
01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.450
You know that Guy Tom totally stole that bit where it's like,
well,

1040
01:04:58.451 --> 01:04:58.900
you know what I mean?

1041
01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:02.140
That's sort of like this about three member then Moran Mess.
Yeah.

1042
01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:07.400
But when it's like shot for shot,
you know,
the same thing.
Totally different.
And,

1043
01:05:07.401 --> 01:05:10.120
and,
and when there's,
when there's,
you know,

1044
01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:15.550
not dozens but like literally like,
you know,
almost,
you know,

1045
01:05:15.551 --> 01:05:18.940
there's a hundred bits.
Sure.
Exactly.
Same.
You start to go on.
It's kind of unfair,

1046
01:05:18.941 --> 01:05:23.420
you know?
But,
um,
then at the same time,
you know,
I've,

1047
01:05:23.421 --> 01:05:26.380
I've gone through phases of how I deal with this emotionally.

1048
01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:30.180
Initially I was angry about it when I first started seeing that,

1049
01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:33.880
and then I got tired of being angry about it.

1050
01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:38.590
So I started being more kind of like,
oh yeah,
we're all,
you know,

1051
01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.540
doing the,
we all inspired by things.

1052
01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:43.150
And then lately I'm kind of a little bit more like,
no,

1053
01:05:43.151 --> 01:05:46.840
I'm just going to talk about it.
You know,
I'm just gonna talk about it,
you know,

1054
01:05:46.841 --> 01:05:51.640
cause I,
I look,
I,
I,
you know,
my line for a few years when asked about this was,

1055
01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:56.860
you know,
um,
you know,
I was inspired by Letterman,
right.

1056
01:05:57.010 --> 01:06:00.370
Letter would yell out of his office with a megaphone.
Yeah.

1057
01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.560
So then I want it to go out in the street with a megaphone.
Right.

1058
01:06:02.561 --> 01:06:05.110
So that's kind of a broad thing,

1059
01:06:05.111 --> 01:06:09.300
but it's a little different when it's like mid forbid a planned out thing is

1060
01:06:09.330 --> 01:06:13.850
different.
Even Straight Jack Dude,
like,
yeah,
but it's true,

1061
01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:18.340
but it's like,
you know,
I don't,
I don't like to,
uh,
uh,
appear

1062
01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:22.240
<v 5>bitter about it.
I got you.
I'll tell you one thing that I just realized like,</v>

1063
01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:24.250
and he's sitting here talking to you about that.

1064
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:29.670
That I feel like the feeling that I'm most excited me that I still,

1065
01:06:29.891 --> 01:06:33.790
I think probably is what clicks with people too about that time about fucking

1066
01:06:33.791 --> 01:06:38.791
with your parents is how much joy so many of us get from fucking with our own

1067
01:06:38.951 --> 01:06:39.784
parents.
Yeah.

1068
01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:44.190
And that's really like seeing your dad's face when he saw the slut tmobile.
What,

1069
01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:48.760
what happens to me is that I feel like I'm looking at kind of a representation

1070
01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:52.420
of all of our parents,
that guy,
kind of a conservative guy,

1071
01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:55.440
probably a good person does the right thing and they're,

1072
01:06:55.450 --> 01:06:58.450
they're good examples to us.
Like my parents,
they're good people,

1073
01:06:58.870 --> 01:07:03.760
but I know they're good people and I know what their sensibility is and I know

1074
01:07:03.761 --> 01:07:08.761
where their lines are and I think everybody kind of gets a thrill out of poking

1075
01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:14.290
your parents.
Like I still love upsetting my parents to a degree.

1076
01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:16.390
Yeah.
I love getting that reaction.

1077
01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:21.400
I love calling my mom and just burping on the phone and have her be like,
ah,

1078
01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:23.800
you're so disgusting.
And he's hearing,

1079
01:07:23.890 --> 01:07:28.890
hearing her disappointment in me being gross is a thrill still to this day,

1080
01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:29.711
you know?

1081
01:07:29.711 --> 01:07:34.420
And I feel like what you did like that kind of represented that to all of us

1082
01:07:34.421 --> 01:07:38.140
watching it like oh yeah,
like it's ups like something to upset your parents

1083
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:41.490
<v 4>and you know how you can push them and you know where you can push them exactly.</v>

1084
01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:45.920
That ultimately,
even if you push them a little bit too far,
you know

1085
01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:50.100
<v 5>it's okay.
They're not going to call the cops probably.
Yeah.</v>

1086
01:07:50.250 --> 01:07:53.220
I sent my mother,
um,
she was like,

1087
01:07:53.250 --> 01:07:57.000
I sent her a picture of our baby and she wrote bag.
It's so beautiful.

1088
01:07:57.030 --> 01:07:59.930
And then I sent her a picture of um,

1089
01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:04.020
an elephant reaching into or as a gift,
you know,

1090
01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:08.370
reaching into another elephant's ass,
pulling out a piece of shit and eating it.

1091
01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:11.040
That happens.
That I guess that have happened.

1092
01:08:11.041 --> 01:08:13.230
That's something that happens because there's a little,
there's a Gif of it.
Yeah.

1093
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:14.930
<v 4>Well fenced aren't as smart as harassment</v>

1094
01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:19.010
<v 3>and she got sick.
She was like,
you know,
she's like,</v>

1095
01:08:19.011 --> 01:08:20.990
this is a new low even for you.

1096
01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:24.260
And like it was like a little bit of a rant and it made me laugh so hard.

1097
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:29.210
So then I just looked up more animal shit things and just send stuff like that

1098
01:08:29.211 --> 01:08:31.520
to your mother.
It's funny because she's,

1099
01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:36.320
she's offended on multiple levels.
One level she's offended by what you sent,

1100
01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:40.460
but then she's also offended that you would send that to your mother.
Yeah.

1101
01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:45.590
And then she's offended that she didn't do her job as a mother to have somebody

1102
01:08:46.041 --> 01:08:47.330
that would do this to their mother.

1103
01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:51.140
Feels like Ellis.

1104
01:08:51.141 --> 01:08:56.080
We have a two and a half year old Kiddo and he loves to go into my purse and get

1105
01:08:56.750 --> 01:09:01.340
the brightest red lipstick and paint the walls and we've caught them doing it

1106
01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:05.210
and he knows to get my attention it's got to do is go to the Paris,

1107
01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:09.110
look at me like I'm going to fucking do this.

1108
01:09:09.111 --> 01:09:12.440
And then I yell at him and he runs away with the person.
It's a fun game.

1109
01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:18.950
Look at me,
mommy,
I might be naughty painting your house.

1110
01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:23.120
He's already a prankster on your hands.
This guy,

1111
01:09:23.121 --> 01:09:24.710
you think this is a Tom Green fan here?

1112
01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:29.590
<v 11>Hi Yah.
Yah,
Yah.
No,

My mother fucking name.</v>

1113
01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:34.270
First Day out.
Let's get it.
First Day out,
I ain't playing no motherfucking game.

1114
01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:37.960
I'm back on our block.
Slipped in and in that mother fucking coke cane.

1115
01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:39.070
I'm Bryce silver.

1116
01:09:39.190 --> 01:09:42.790
I got these gold chains around my neck and these diamonds in my ears.

1117
01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:46.030
You can have full full lace should I essential shots and make your fucking

1118
01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:46.893
disappear.

1119
01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:52.210
<v 3>Wow.
That's Brian's silver.
Oh yeah.</v>

1120
01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:56.700
He's got a big Instagram following
online.

1121
01:09:56.770 --> 01:09:59.120
He talks a lot of shit as you can see.
Absolutely.

1122
01:09:59.190 --> 01:10:02.620
And apparently he got locked up for something.
No.
Yeah,
yeah.
This,

1123
01:10:02.670 --> 01:10:05.860
this is his literal first day out.
So he's one,

1124
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:11.390
he's one of your regular callers or we've featured him before.

1125
01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:16.600
He's a star of your mom's house.
Is he like interact with the,
with the show here?

1126
01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:19.750
No,
he's not one who interacts well.
Yeah.

1127
01:10:19.751 --> 01:10:23.470
This is the best thing is that this was his first day out.

1128
01:10:23.471 --> 01:10:27.310
And on his first day out video,
he announced that he's selling cocaine.

1129
01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:33.930
<v 11>Oh,
my trademarks and motherfucking child to take my shit.
Guess what bitch,</v>

1130
01:10:33.931 --> 01:10:35.770
you ain't nothing but a motherfucking trick.

1131
01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:39.300
Lick his shit off my motherfucking feet.
I'll bet.
Exactly.

1132
01:10:39.450 --> 01:10:41.770
Y'All go ahead and tell them mother fucking friend

1133
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:45.970
<v 3>Juno award nominee here.
No,
I'm back.
Yeah,
exactly.
I mean,</v>

1134
01:10:46.190 --> 01:10:51.090
would he have made it in the group?
Yeah,
he would've.
He would've.
Yeah.

1135
01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:55.960
<v 11>Oh,
glad.
I feel like I'm looking at mine 40 in an AK 47 I'd make your head don't</v>

1136
01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:57.260
motherfucking back lit.

1137
01:10:57.830 --> 01:11:02.330
<v 3>Yeah.
She rapped about,
you know,
uh,
Kinda,</v>

1138
01:11:02.450 --> 01:11:06.590
I mean,
are we were pretty nerdy.
I mean,
we were much nerdier than this guy.

1139
01:11:06.591 --> 01:11:11.180
This guy's now got the tax,
the gold,
the cocaine,
you know,
we didn't,

1140
01:11:11.210 --> 01:11:14.220
we didn't have the cocaine.
People might call him a culture vulture,
you know,

1141
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:18.060
<v 4>so
we were like appropriating,</v>

1142
01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:21.660
we were more trying to be like Beastie boys.
Right.
But,
uh,

1143
01:11:21.690 --> 01:11:24.820
but we were kind of staying in your lane,
varying your white layer.

1144
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:28.460
Very Canadian Canada.
We weren't even from Toronto.
That's how,
you know.
Right,

1145
01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:31.380
right.
I was like the least hardcore place to be from,

1146
01:11:31.381 --> 01:11:35.760
but you guys were celebrated.
Uh,
you know,
we had,
uh,
we had,
uh,
we had,

1147
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:38.700
you know,
again,
like

1148
01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:44.820
we were kind of Nerdy,
you know,
um,
and,
uh,
you know,
I,

1149
01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:47.120
I made all these songs and we,

1150
01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:51.680
I managed to convince a and m records Canada to give us this record deal.

1151
01:11:51.710 --> 01:11:55.850
Unbelievable.
When the record came out,
we're in Toronto,
we went,

1152
01:11:55.851 --> 01:11:57.560
did a show in Toronto and you know,

1153
01:11:57.561 --> 01:12:02.420
the hardcore Toronto urban hip hop community,

1154
01:12:02.421 --> 01:12:06.650
which exists in,
is real and was,
was,
was not happy that,

1155
01:12:06.651 --> 01:12:09.360
that this sort of,
uh,
you know,
uh,

1156
01:12:09.410 --> 01:12:13.330
nerdy white group from Ottawa got a record deal,
you know,
when,
you know,

1157
01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:14.480
where did we come from,
kind of thing.

1158
01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.970
And we did the show once in Toronto and you know,

1159
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.840
we had a song that was called check Theo or was the numerous on check the,

1160
01:12:20.841 --> 01:12:24.830
your trek,
the Organized Ryan was,
aren't being met.
And it was like the song was,

1161
01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:29.840
the course was check the,
or you like it so far,
right.
Nerdy,
right?
And,

1162
01:12:29.841 --> 01:12:30.830
uh,
so then,
you know,

1163
01:12:30.831 --> 01:12:33.860
we went and performed at the show and this other rap group went on before us and

1164
01:12:33.861 --> 01:12:38.810
they were like,
they had guns.
Okay.
And they were,
they the,
the revealed the guns.

1165
01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:41.450
Like we saw the guns and this is Canada.

1166
01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:44.780
Like nobody's got guns in Canada.
Right?

1167
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:48.400
But these guys had guns and they were there,
their rap was fuck the,
Oh,

1168
01:12:48.401 --> 01:12:50.510
are we hate it so far.
Rightly did before us.
Right?

1169
01:12:50.511 --> 01:12:53.140
And then there's like total beef thing and then we would,

1170
01:12:53.150 --> 01:12:55.370
then we went on stage and perform in front of this,
you know,

1171
01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.110
all hip hop crowd and um,
how'd you do?

1172
01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:03.890
We were basically the only white people that are basically,
which is fine,

1173
01:13:03.891 --> 01:13:07.370
but it was like,
you know,
and half the audience did not like,

1174
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:08.940
I have so much anxiety right now.

1175
01:13:08.970 --> 01:13:12.590
Half the audience liked us because they were sort of down with our crew because

1176
01:13:12.591 --> 01:13:16.250
we got signed with this band called the dream warriors,
which were,
you know,

1177
01:13:16.251 --> 01:13:19.910
a real band and Toronto that were popular.
Uh,

1178
01:13:19.911 --> 01:13:24.590
but then the other half that goes sort of like rival gangs and stuff,
you know,

1179
01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:28.670
we have that in Canada.
A guy was pointing a gun at me while I was on stage.

1180
01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:30.430
Oh my God.
I was trying to be like,
and it had,

1181
01:13:30.530 --> 01:13:34.640
I remember I had it had tape on it because he'd publicly used it so much that it

1182
01:13:34.641 --> 01:13:39.100
broke.
Yeah.
And,
uh,
and uh,
and uh,
and then,
uh,

1183
01:13:39.130 --> 01:13:39.963
then they were,

1184
01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:43.910
people were grabbing me while I was on stage and pulling me to the crowd and

1185
01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:47.360
punching me in the head basically.
And we kept rapping.
We did this whole thing.

1186
01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:49.910
It was,
it was,
it was at this,
it was called the barbecue.

1187
01:13:49.970 --> 01:13:54.050
It was what it was called.
And it was,
uh,
basically this underground like hip hop,

1188
01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:57.120
uh,
you know,
venue.
And,
uh,

1189
01:13:57.170 --> 01:13:59.750
then we had to get like sort of like rushed through the crowd after everyone's

1190
01:13:59.751 --> 01:14:01.940
taking punches at us and stuff.
It was Bruce pretty cool.

1191
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:05.240
It actually felt very exciting at the time.
But,
uh,

1192
01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:07.490
I have a feeling like if I looked like that guy,

1193
01:14:07.491 --> 01:14:10.770
they might've been more acceptive maybes that hey fucking that guys a little

1194
01:14:10.771 --> 01:14:12.050
more.
I'm

1195
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:16.090
<v 11>back.
Oh,
I said once,
I ain't going to say in a motherfucking game.</v>

1196
01:14:16.330 --> 01:14:20.540
I got these motherfucking Fufu ass motherfuckers ignore me on my motherfucking

1197
01:14:20.650 --> 01:14:24.310

1198
01:14:24.311 --> 01:14:27.340

Man.

1199
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:29.200
I was in motherfucking prison Nigga.

1200
01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:34.080
<v 3>Yeah,
there you go.
Yeah.
It's a big word there,
a big word,</v>

1201
01:14:34.081 --> 01:14:38.900
but that his art has evolved.
I remember the first time we met Brian,
so he was,

1202
01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:41.000
yeah,
he was shirtless.

1203
01:14:42.610 --> 01:14:44.060
<v 1>So I have a funny question.</v>

1204
01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:51.700
<v 3>We are good at a party like time we discovered these weed.
We did a,</v>

1205
01:14:51.770 --> 01:14:56.360
a weird porn segment last.
Oh,
okay.
And that was uh,
uh,

1206
01:14:56.361 --> 01:14:59.730
that's race porn,
race play point.
You heard of this?
No,
no.

1207
01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:04.630
This way were they have a play form.
This is what,
Oh,
okay.

1208
01:15:04.631 --> 01:15:05.180
How you play.

1209
01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:09.170
<v 1>Well,
cool.
So I have a funny question to ask you guys.</v>

1210
01:15:10.730 --> 01:15:14.870
As Nicole by I say the n word,
it turns me on

1211
01:15:16.670 --> 01:15:18.280
this idea of word.
I'm Yo Nigga

1212
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:21.960
Love Dick.

1213
01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:26.100
<v 3>Yeah.
It's pretty intense.
It's 20 questions.
Yeah,
that's right.
Well,
yeah,</v>

1214
01:15:26.190 --> 01:15:30.750
it's very habit.
It's funny that it starts with,
I have a funny question.

1215
01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:32.380
It's funny question.

1216
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:37.980
It's interesting that we're living in a world now where like you can sort of

1217
01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:43.040
instantly access a soundbite of virtually any combination of words no matter how

1218
01:15:44.671 --> 01:15:49.630
unlikely.
Yeah.
And it's all immediately at your fingertips.
There was also,
um,

1219
01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:53.680
there was,
uh,
a nine 11.
Wow.

1220
01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:57.520
US military forces are wow.

1221
01:15:59.710 --> 01:16:03.130
Nine,
11 porn.
Yup.
Yup.
Then there's Osama,

1222
01:16:03.131 --> 01:16:06.130
and I don't want to see how this ends.
Thank you.

1223
01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:13.020
I'll be looking it up later.
But,
um,
uh,
there was a disabled porn,

1224
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:17.180
uh,
which is apparently a huge genre.
Yeah.
With,
I mean,

1225
01:16:17.181 --> 01:16:20.540
there's everything from stumps and,
um,
you know,

1226
01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:25.550
canes completely.
People who have zero ability to move.

1227
01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:29.750
Yeah.
And somebody doesn't sound right.
Does it?
Uh,
servicing them?
Yeah.

1228
01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:33.110
And then,
and then there's like,
I gotta go pee pee in my died.

1229
01:16:33.670 --> 01:16:37.130
He's literally go there on the show,
right.
Like,

1230
01:16:38.810 --> 01:16:40.310
I'm sorta ramped up to this.

1231
01:16:40.311 --> 01:16:44.990
So you didn't come out of the gate with the diaper porn,
but,
uh,

1232
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:50.290
we're sort of
loosened up a little bit now.
I can.
Yeah.
I mean,

1233
01:16:50.291 --> 01:16:54.440
you've been here for now hyper porn.
No,
that's cool.
Yeah,

1234
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:57.530
I mean it's definitely like a,
you know,

1235
01:16:57.531 --> 01:17:00.650
I'm in a position here of a half to really kind of figure like,

1236
01:17:00.651 --> 01:17:03.950
how am I supposed to react?
You know,
cause like,
you know,
but it look us cause uh,

1237
01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:08.840
yeah,
it is kind of awesome.
Lee,

1238
01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:13.700
the world we're living in now,
it's pretty crazy.
Yeah.
And uh,
I don't think like,

1239
01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:17.660
you know,
I mean I talk about this too much about,
you know,

1240
01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:21.160
I'm 47 so,
you know,

1241
01:17:21.170 --> 01:17:26.170
I clearly have a very clear and real memory of no Internet.

1242
01:17:27.530 --> 01:17:31.220
You know,
I'm not no internet but no video on the Internet.
Sure.
So,
you know,

1243
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:32.360
and I'll,

1244
01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:36.560
I was always very fascinated by crazy videos because there was very few of them,

1245
01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:37.670
of course.
So,
you know,

1246
01:17:37.671 --> 01:17:41.780
when I was in high school or even elementary spaces as a dad,
right.

1247
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:46.460
Faces of death.
Right.
So that was the only thing that was like weird like that,

1248
01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:50.450
you know.
Oh,
are those,
um,
and they also had like weird spaces at death,

1249
01:17:50.451 --> 01:17:52.960
which was like kind of [inaudible] was another one.
Yeah,

1250
01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:55.930
<v 0>I remember.
Um,
basically,</v>

1251
01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:59.260
but there was mixed tapes of outrageous shit.

1252
01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.010
I love like James Brown interview,
right?
Yeah.

1253
01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:07.300
CNN where he's coked out and he's like,
Shit like that.
And would cut together.

1254
01:18:07.370 --> 01:18:10.570
Would pass around VHS.
Yeah.
It wasn't one that,

1255
01:18:10.571 --> 01:18:15.310
who was pissing on some girl.
Now your breath smells like piss.
Oh,
wow.
The Guy,

1256
01:18:15.311 --> 01:18:19.220
he uh,
he's like,
I kiss you but your breath smells like piss.
Yeah.
Huge.

1257
01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:24.050
In my high school hearted farted in that girl face.
Yes.
Blowing him.

1258
01:18:24.051 --> 01:18:28.180
And he was like,
Oh,
did I far?
And she's like,
yeah.
He's like,
yeah,

1259
01:18:28.181 --> 01:18:31.690
that happens sometimes.
It's the,

1260
01:18:32.730 --> 01:18:35.320
what's the Grand Guitar Rock?

1261
01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:39.970
Barry Barry Barry is chuck Barry Barry was,

1262
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:44.990
should I get mixed up with Chuck Barris sex tapes that they would be confiscated

1263
01:18:45.101 --> 01:18:49.150
during a raid?
It was a drug raid that the DEA did.

1264
01:18:49.210 --> 01:18:51.390
It was like a nonsense,
I think raid.
Yeah.

1265
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:55.870
They've found that the VHS tapes were confiscated during the raid and then they

1266
01:18:55.871 --> 01:19:00.430
got leaked and he liked,
he was like,
he pissed on this girl.

1267
01:19:00.431 --> 01:19:03.700
He's like,
he pisses on her in the table and he's like,
damn,

1268
01:19:03.701 --> 01:19:08.230
you smell like piss now.
Like,
yeah,
you just missed the heat on a downy.
He's like,

1269
01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:12.990
uh,
it was,
it was,
no,
he says,
I kiss you but your breath smells like piss.
Yeah.

1270
01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.863
And I was like,
yeah,

1271
01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:17.290
<v 3>no.
What is that on the Internet?
Yeah.
That's on the other yet.</v>

1272
01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:21.190
That is now on the Internet.
Oh yeah.
You want to see it?
Uh,

1273
01:19:22.050 --> 01:19:26.670
yeah.
Okay.
I mean,
I dunno,
like maybe,
maybe,
maybe not.

1274
01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:30.070
Okay.
Okay.
Maybe I want to see it.
Okay.
But uh,
you want to,
I'll,

1275
01:19:30.071 --> 01:19:32.670
I'll do describe it.
Well,
no,
no,
I just,
I was going to say,

1276
01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:35.310
why don't I just email you later.
Sends me later.
Okay.
Yeah.
I don't want to,

1277
01:19:35.311 --> 01:19:39.510
I don't want to appear as if I want to see it.
I got you.
Yeah.

1278
01:19:39.570 --> 01:19:42.270
Even though I do want maybe want to see it later.
Yeah.
Allie method.

1279
01:19:42.271 --> 01:19:45.080
I don't want to be seen wanting to see it.
You know,

1280
01:19:45.081 --> 01:19:46.770
we were discussing right before you came,

1281
01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:51.720
this guy who's clearly a kind of young guy is making a video,

1282
01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:56.580
uh,
where he's reviewing strippers at detail.
I hate this stripper experiences.
No,

1283
01:19:56.581 --> 01:19:58.770
but she's like,
one of the things she says is like,

1284
01:19:58.771 --> 01:20:02.710
what compels someone to do this?
And I go,
well,
you know what,

1285
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:07.790
there's an age range and I think it's about 17 to 22 where testosterone

1286
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:11.400
<v 5>is raging so intensely through us as men.</v>

1287
01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:15.780
That in his mind it's like just talk about sex.

1288
01:20:16.230 --> 01:20:20.190
Even though I know it's not good to do it in this video,

1289
01:20:20.490 --> 01:20:24.960
but because I'm so oversexed talking about it in some way is going to help me.

1290
01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:27.900
Maybe it'll lead to sex.
You know,
it's like he's just

1291
01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:33.400
<v 2>had an interaction with an Ethiopian stripper name of Alisay.</v>

1292
01:20:33.890 --> 01:20:38.890
She was,
you know,
we really danced.
We really grind.
I like girls,

1293
01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:44.540
I like to dry sex is fun.
It's fine.

1294
01:20:44.541 --> 01:20:46.310
I don't get,
I'm not,
but you know,

1295
01:20:46.670 --> 01:20:51.670
just some contacts with [inaudible] dropped down to her knees a few times and

1296
01:20:51.831 --> 01:20:53.780
play with my dick through my shorts.

1297
01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:58.220
Basketball weren't basketball strip club.

1298
01:20:58.850 --> 01:21:02.080
I'm wearing basketball shorts to the strip club.
It was fine.
You know,

1299
01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:03.380
I think she likes my deck.

1300
01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:10.170
<v 3>Yes.
Well it's a thing like,
you know,</v>

1301
01:21:10.171 --> 01:21:13.520
guys,
probably,
what is he in his twenties or something and he looks,

1302
01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:17.040
he looks not as good because he,

1303
01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:21.600
he should definitely not rock the horse shoe at his age.
He should just,
you know,

1304
01:21:21.601 --> 01:21:24.150
buzz it down,
but he's going to like it.

1305
01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:27.290
He's going to be 40 someday.
Yeah.

1306
01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:30.490
This video's going to be out there on the Internet probably,
right?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1307
01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:34.850
Or is,
is he able to delete this?
No,
no,
no.
We're not helping.
Oh,
right,
right.
Yeah.

1308
01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:36.320
It's permanently on your,
yeah.

1309
01:21:37.230 --> 01:21:41.880
So he might not have been thinking of that,
that he was going to go viral.

1310
01:21:42.450 --> 01:21:44.340
Um,
and uh,

1311
01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:48.510
there's gonna be a lot of people with a lot of regret.

1312
01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:52.930
I think the world in about 20 years from now,
it used to just be people in

1313
01:21:53.010 --> 01:21:56.550
<v 5>porn will be like,
oh,
I have a video that I hope no one sees.</v>

1314
01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.110
And now here's the thing though,

1315
01:21:58.410 --> 01:22:03.360
is the fact that there's so many people with so many videos that they're going

1316
01:22:03.361 --> 01:22:06.090
to regret just going to kind of lesson.

1317
01:22:06.230 --> 01:22:11.200
<v 3>Yeah.
Our access to shame.
Yeah,
exactly.</v>

1318
01:22:11.210 --> 01:22:13.310
There's no shame in the culture anymore.

1319
01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:15.620
Everybody's oversharing all the fucking time.

1320
01:22:15.970 --> 01:22:19.730
Which is interesting what you were saying in the 90s I mean before the Internet.

1321
01:22:20.090 --> 01:22:20.241
Yeah,

1322
01:22:20.241 --> 01:22:24.050
there was just like a handful of these Weirdos and you cherish this weird crap

1323
01:22:24.290 --> 01:22:26.870
and now you're like,
is everybody mentally ill?

1324
01:22:26.930 --> 01:22:30.970
Like are most people just fucking nutty?
And we didn't know it.
Well,

1325
01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:32.430
even like that look

1326
01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:34.560
<v 5>like a decorum,</v>

1327
01:22:34.710 --> 01:22:39.510
the way that even like the president talks and you know,

1328
01:22:39.511 --> 01:22:43.590
handles himself and does press.
It's a total shift.

1329
01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:44.700
And it's also,

1330
01:22:44.850 --> 01:22:48.090
maybe it's shifted things permanently because everything used to be very,

1331
01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:51.150
I mean even in honestly until a couple of years ago,

1332
01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:56.130
the president would say things very structured.
It would feel like a rehearsed.

1333
01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:57.860
Yeah.
Almost always positioned.

1334
01:22:57.861 --> 01:23:02.700
It was as if he knew what he was talking about or something.
Right.

1335
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.830
And now it's just,
he's,
you know,
he's just like,
I don't give a fuck.

1336
01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:11.770
<v 4>It's like the idiocrasy,
it's sort of like,
uh,
you know,</v>

1337
01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:15.160
the only way to break through,
I guess the,

1338
01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:20.030
the din of all of this information now is to say something wrong,
you know,

1339
01:23:20.050 --> 01:23:24.220
just to sort of essentially do something shocking.
Um,

1340
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:28.600
but like I,
I kinda like,
I,
I agree.
Like it's kind of like,

1341
01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:33.490
it's so,
there's so much of it now.
Yeah.
In a way,

1342
01:23:33.491 --> 01:23:36.940
it's kind of why I sort of stop doing videos.

1343
01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:41.490
Like even though I made,
may do another,
this is empty now,
but I don't know,

1344
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:46.290
I may do another version of a,
my show,
by the way,
I'm really not,

1345
01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:49.390
I'm not actually able to announce it officially yet,

1346
01:23:49.391 --> 01:23:54.370
but I am talking to fun little television channel about bringing back the Tom

1347
01:23:54.370 --> 01:23:56.860
Green show in some capacity through that would be so often going to be

1348
01:23:56.861 --> 01:24:00.280
interesting because it is a different,
you know,
the different world now.
You know,

1349
01:24:00.281 --> 01:24:03.760
like,
you know,
it's like you said,
like,
you know,
we welcome watch,
you know,

1350
01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:06.790
you know,
all of this crazy stuff now.

1351
01:24:06.791 --> 01:24:11.140
So I think that's kind of big was a big motivator for me to actually start doing

1352
01:24:11.141 --> 01:24:12.340
standup again.
You know,
cause I,

1353
01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:16.660
I realized like that's something that you can't just sort of,
you know,

1354
01:24:16.930 --> 01:24:21.250
people can't just copy that.
Yeah.
You know,
it's,
it's,

1355
01:24:21.251 --> 01:24:25.060
it's a,
you know,
you have to get up on stage and you have to be able to do it.

1356
01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:26.890
Yeah.
So,
um,

1357
01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:31.540
that's why I think I've actually been really kind of,
you know,

1358
01:24:31.541 --> 01:24:33.690
really focusing and enjoying doing standup.

1359
01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:37.570
Like that's pretty much all I do now is I just travel,
do standup.

1360
01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:42.430
I next week I'm in New Jersey,
the stress factory.
I'm a stressed factory.

1361
01:24:42.431 --> 01:24:44.710
I'm in Providence,
Rhode Island for one night or,

1362
01:24:44.711 --> 01:24:48.220
and they have stress factory than I'm at governor's for one night or a nice long

1363
01:24:48.221 --> 01:24:51.190
island,
Boston and Laugh Boston coming up.

1364
01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:53.980
And I wouldn't tell you this if I just wouldn't bring this up.

1365
01:24:54.010 --> 01:24:59.010
You're probably the only guy that took a break from standup that I hear people

1366
01:25:00.010 --> 01:25:04.720
comics compliment all the time.
Oh,
well yes.
Well that's nice to hear.

1367
01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.450
Thank you for telling me that.
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1368
01:25:06.490 --> 01:25:11.490
And I remember when you started like really doing spots probably a few years

1369
01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:14.680
ago,
right?
Like when you,
you know,
you've,
you've been added again for awhile now,

1370
01:25:14.681 --> 01:25:16.820
but when you really,
seven or eight years.
Yeah,
yeah.

1371
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:21.400
I would say maybe like four years ago.
Yeah.
Um,
I,
you know,

1372
01:25:21.401 --> 01:25:23.860
you hearing in green rooms,
people like,
you know,

1373
01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:26.680
Tom Green started doing standup again and you're like,
yeah,
how has it,

1374
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:31.730
everybody was like,
compliment.
Oh,
that's really good to hear.
Cause I,

1375
01:25:31.810 --> 01:25:36.460
I,
I,
you know,
you know,
you don't know what people say,
but of course it's like,

1376
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:39.910
it's,
uh,
you know,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,

1377
01:25:40.150 --> 01:25:44.080
I feel fortunate that,
you know,
MTV pump my show out all over the world.

1378
01:25:44.081 --> 01:25:47.350
So that's given me a lot of opportunity to perform,
you know.
Sure.
So like,

1379
01:25:47.351 --> 01:25:51.680
I get to go,
you know,
I've done like Australia and I've just did,
you know,

1380
01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:53.560
England and stuff last year.

1381
01:25:53.561 --> 01:25:57.150
And I'm sort of always going and it's great because I'm kind of,
uh,
you know,

1382
01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:01.990
I don't have,
I don't have kids.
Uh,
uh,
you know,

1383
01:26:02.170 --> 01:26:04.160
not nuts.
I May,
I may

1384
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:07.430
<v 3>want to have kids someday.
I'm getting pretty old now,
but,
uh,
you know,
I,</v>

1385
01:26:07.431 --> 01:26:08.780
I have a lot of free time,
you know,

1386
01:26:08.781 --> 01:26:12.790
so I'm able to just kind of keep going and uh,
it's been,
it's been amazing.

1387
01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:15.290
You're a great comic,
but I will not,
I will not tell you.

1388
01:26:15.291 --> 01:26:17.330
You're not the king of Improv.
I'll tell you who that is.

1389
01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:19.440
<v 12>I am the king of Improv.</v>

1390
01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:24.540
<v 3>Do you know who that is?
Do you know who the self proclaimed King of Improv is?</v>

1391
01:26:25.010 --> 01:26:27.120
Do you want to hear it again?
Sounded like Trump,
but can you play it again?

1392
01:26:27.250 --> 01:26:29.880
<v 12>Mean I am the king of in province for,
for you.</v>

1393
01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:33.210
<v 3>Oh,
I get to play that one more time.</v>

1394
01:26:33.630 --> 01:26:35.720
<v 12>When I am the king of in province</v>

1395
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:41.330
<v 3>Charlie Sheen or no,
here's another,
here's another hint</v>

1396
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:47.880
and it's like,
ah,
ah,

1397
01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:50.460
is that Drake?
No,
I dunno know.
Here's who it is.

1398
01:26:50.461 --> 01:26:54.590
It's the absolute king of self proclaimed King of Improv right here.
Oh,

1399
01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:55.433
Steven Seagal.

1400
01:26:55.490 --> 01:26:57.480
<v 13>Oh really?</v>

1401
01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:03.180
Have the highest hopes that I can be of some use to kind of try to get people to

1402
01:27:03.181 --> 01:27:07.190
have meaningful conversations and uh,

1403
01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:08.910
meaningful meetings with

1404
01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:12.650
<v 3>now do you want to see him be super improvising here?
Yeah.</v>

1405
01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:16.890
That was wearing the Kung Fu ogee.
Yeah.
Russia for interviews.

1406
01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:21.180
He does and he's wearing his villain glasses and just painted his hair and

1407
01:27:21.181 --> 01:27:26.120
goatee.
Dark black with a sharpie.
Nice and easy.
Nice and easy.

1408
01:27:26.121 --> 01:27:28.500
You do it in the bathroom and how black dye in his hair,

1409
01:27:28.501 --> 01:27:32.490
which looks perfect on a 60 something year old man.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1410
01:27:32.491 --> 01:27:36.840
It doesn't look suspect at all.
Well,
let's watch him improvise.

1411
01:27:37.090 --> 01:27:40.110
<v 14>We obviously spend a lot of time in Russia.
You spend a lot of time in America,</v>

1412
01:27:40.111 --> 01:27:44.070
you're making films and so forth.
And in terms of your life in America,

1413
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:48.660
you've been very much caught up in all the allegations of sexual harassment.

1414
01:27:48.670 --> 01:27:51.030
You had a rape allegation against you and I want to know,

1415
01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:56.080
<v 3>hey,
look at that.
I didn't know where the checks,
you just improvise.</v>

1416
01:27:56.620 --> 01:28:00.710
Take the microphone off.
You
go there.
And of course though,

1417
01:28:00.711 --> 01:28:04.410
we didn't respond there.
He has said previously he denies any allegations.
Yeah.

1418
01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:08.120
But that Improv was just like boom.
Yeah.
It was pretty cool.

1419
01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:12.340
You had that planned out I think.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was kind of neat.
I didn't know,
uh,

1420
01:28:12.530 --> 01:28:15.380
where I kind of vaguely heard rumblings about the rape stuff.

1421
01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:20.060
I think I'd seen that,
uh,
that clip.
Oh really?
Recently?
Yeah.
It was the,
you know,

1422
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:25.460
Steven Seagal man.
I mean,
I used to actually really like his movies under siege.

1423
01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:28.460
Sure.
Yeah.
I think that was the biggest box office hit,

1424
01:28:28.710 --> 01:28:32.690
but it started with like out for justice.
Hard to kill.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1425
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:34.730
I used to watch those as a kid.
I loved the,

1426
01:28:34.731 --> 01:28:38.850
my Stepdad from India used to love Steven Seagal.
That was his favorite.
Yeah.

1427
01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:41.360
Yeah.
Who was telling us what a piece of shit he is the other day,

1428
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:45.830
somebody about the biggest difference between directing him.

1429
01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:47.810
Like somebody directed him in that first one,

1430
01:28:47.811 --> 01:28:50.540
like hard to kill or out for justice can.
They were like,

1431
01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:55.010
this guy is just somebody,
like,
he was like,
uh,
a studio guys,

1432
01:28:55.170 --> 01:28:58.190
a workout trainer.
Like it was,
that's how it started.

1433
01:28:58.670 --> 01:29:01.980
Like somebody at paramount was like,
I need a workout.
And he

1434
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:05.490
<v 4>trained them and then they ended up making a movie with him and he was like the</v>

1435
01:29:05.491 --> 01:29:07.440
nicest fucking guy.
And he goes,

1436
01:29:07.441 --> 01:29:10.770
and then like he did three other movies and then I directed him and something

1437
01:29:10.771 --> 01:29:15.720
else.
And they're like,
biggest piece of garbage,
like ever was to golf.

1438
01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:18.690
He just lost it.
Stunt guy lost his mind.

1439
01:29:18.691 --> 01:29:22.500
I talked to a couple of stunt guys shooting something and they were like,
man,

1440
01:29:22.530 --> 01:29:23.400
hands down.

1441
01:29:23.401 --> 01:29:27.990
The worst person I've ever worked with got was known for a purposely hitting

1442
01:29:27.991 --> 01:29:29.220
guys.
You know what?

1443
01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:33.300
I think breaking guys lose their mind a little bit when they get famous,

1444
01:29:33.301 --> 01:29:37.740
you know,
and then they like,
uh,
you know,
feel like maybe,

1445
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:40.710
maybe,
I don't know if it's social anxiety,

1446
01:29:40.711 --> 01:29:43.680
they don't know how to deal with all the people talking to them or maybe they're

1447
01:29:43.681 --> 01:29:48.540
just assholes to begin with.
I think it's a little bit of that.

1448
01:29:48.630 --> 01:29:53.430
And,
uh,
you know,
cause it seems to happen a fair amount.
Not,
not,
not,

1449
01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:57.890
no,
I wouldn't say all the time,
but like maybe half the time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you.

1450
01:29:57.891 --> 01:30:01.370
And whoever you are before fame just gets amplified.
Yeah.

1451
01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:05.700
I mean thankfully comics are kind of low key cause we get humbled constantly.

1452
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:11.880
There's fewer asshole standup comics actors.
It seems to be.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1453
01:30:11.881 --> 01:30:14.040
Everyone seems pretty.
That's what,
that's what I,

1454
01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:17.550
I've been loving about doing sets around town and in Ela here it's like,

1455
01:30:17.551 --> 01:30:22.320
you know,
you get to interact with a lot of your,
uh,
your heroes,
you know?

1456
01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:25.950
Yeah.
Pretty cool.
It is pretty cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's,
it's a,
it's pretty well,

1457
01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:30.870
you know.
That's cool.
So,
um,
amazing.
So like what's this,

1458
01:30:31.980 --> 01:30:36.000
that it's a good question.
Oh,
I know.
I know why that's built like that.

1459
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.140
What is this?
Okay.
I know why this is felt like this.

1460
01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:42.600
So this right here used to be in that room and it was the guys production desk.

1461
01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:46.650
Oh,
okay.
I had all the different,
you know,
uh,
racks and everything in it.

1462
01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:50.800
Cause this is an actual recording studio.
It was an actual recording studio.

1463
01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:54.870
Amazing Room.
I this was going to have monitors on it at one point.

1464
01:30:54.890 --> 01:30:58.890
So the guy converted and stuff like drilled the hole.
Okay.
Yup.
Yeah.
He was like,

1465
01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:03.330
oh,
I'll make it turn so you can turn monitor.
Ah,
Nice.
I got to go one of these.

1466
01:31:03.390 --> 01:31:07.410
I have a little recording studio at home.
I'm making hip hop beats.

1467
01:31:08.250 --> 01:31:09.020
Getting back into,

1468
01:31:09.020 --> 01:31:12.480
you want me to put you in touch with Brian's Silva so that you can have a,

1469
01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:15.570
you can make the beats then he can get right.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1470
01:31:15.570 --> 01:31:19.050
I want to get him on a track for sure.
Yeah.
I mean be the next little pump.

1471
01:31:19.470 --> 01:31:23.250
That's right.
Calm little something for sure.
Yeah,
it'd be great.
You know,

1472
01:31:23.710 --> 01:31:28.650
but you guys are moving to a new studio though.
We are,
yeah.
Are you,

1473
01:31:28.651 --> 01:31:31.050
are you going to keep the studio here also?

1474
01:31:31.150 --> 01:31:35.870
So I'm sure not being here or in the other school,
this idea,
she likes to say,

1475
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:39.800
but you were talking about converting this studio into a movie theater that

1476
01:31:39.970 --> 01:31:42.930
would be more fun.
And we may be still,

1477
01:31:42.931 --> 01:31:45.840
like what you could do is make it a movie theater room,

1478
01:31:45.841 --> 01:31:49.290
but just keep the mics out so you could sit around on the couches and do it here

1479
01:31:49.291 --> 01:31:50.940
without all the table and stuff.

1480
01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:55.180
So then if you ever don't feel like going in to the studio,
because I'll,

1481
01:31:55.181 --> 01:31:58.530
I'll tell you,
I look,
I,
I had a studio in my house.
Okay.

1482
01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:02.110
For both five years.
I call it web.
Oh,
vision.
You know,

1483
01:32:02.111 --> 01:32:06.970
we did the camera switcher,
everything.
And uh,

1484
01:32:06.971 --> 01:32:10.340
you know,
val Kilmer came up with the,
you know,
people come up to the house and,

1485
01:32:10.690 --> 01:32:15.670
and uh,
you know,
I,
I loved it.
And then at a certain point I was kind of like,
oh,

1486
01:32:15.671 --> 01:32:18.930
I,
I don't want to do it in the house.
Right.
So then I'm,

1487
01:32:18.931 --> 01:32:21.580
I moved the studio somewhere else and then,
um,

1488
01:32:22.570 --> 01:32:24.130
then I kind of like realized,

1489
01:32:24.131 --> 01:32:26.800
well I don't always want to have to go there either,
you know,

1490
01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:30.370
because then you got to drive all the way over there and you know,

1491
01:32:30.430 --> 01:32:34.090
it's like here it's like,
you know,
you guys wake up,

1492
01:32:34.570 --> 01:32:38.740
guest shows up,
do the thing and then I leave and you're still at home,
you know,

1493
01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:40.570
so like this but uh,

1494
01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:43.760
<v 0>Gotcha.
Gotcha.
Was there talking to you?
You're now right?
Yeah.</v>

1495
01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:47.700
That's like your kids are sick or something.
I don't want to go drive.
I know.

1496
01:32:47.701 --> 01:32:48.600
Can't we just keep it up?

1497
01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:52.890
<v 4>Tom Am I,
am I a I don't mean to,</v>

1498
01:32:53.150 --> 01:32:58.100
<v 0>oh,
so grossest person.</v>

1499
01:32:58.101 --> 01:32:59.030
Somebody who has,

1500
01:33:00.610 --> 01:33:03.710
we got an email asking manscaping advice.

1501
01:33:03.711 --> 01:33:07.820
Maybe Tom can weigh in a says I got a question about cleaning up your
downstairs.

1502
01:33:08.300 --> 01:33:11.960
Tom Seems like the kind of person who has hair on most of his body and I happen

1503
01:33:11.961 --> 01:33:15.500
to suffer from the same affliction my lady friend doesn't like when it's super

1504
01:33:15.501 --> 01:33:18.640
bushy while she does mouth work.
So I try to keep it clean.
Yeah.

1505
01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:20.120
Here's where the problem lies.

1506
01:33:20.450 --> 01:33:24.350
I've shaved and just trim my fun hair numerous times.
Each time.

1507
01:33:24.351 --> 01:33:27.140
It doesn't match up with the remaining here on my stomach and legs.

1508
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:29.870
I look neat and tidy until you glance up or down,

1509
01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:32.840
just right back to a gangly mess.
More than anything.

1510
01:33:32.841 --> 01:33:35.540
I just find it looks unsightly and frankly unpleasant.

1511
01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:40.340
So Todd is what they're calling me.
How do you deforest you're Peruvian jungle.

1512
01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:44.480
Best wishes.
Um,
Christine,
you were very funny.

1513
01:33:44.481 --> 01:33:48.770
I have you thought about giving standup comedy ago?
Go try it out regards Harry.

1514
01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:51.470
So Harry,
um,
I dunno,

1515
01:33:51.471 --> 01:33:55.490
like I do this thing where I'll use experiments to clarify.

1516
01:33:55.670 --> 01:34:00.110
He's saying it looks short on around your g twigs and berries and then it's so

1517
01:34:00.111 --> 01:34:04.370
long everywhere else that it's a disparity in the,
the length of the hair.

1518
01:34:04.371 --> 01:34:06.560
I mean it's,
I don't know,
man.
Are you shooting videos?

1519
01:34:06.561 --> 01:34:08.780
Who cares what it looks like?
Just trim it down.

1520
01:34:09.050 --> 01:34:13.790
And then I do find that like taking the razor till your junk.
Uh,

1521
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:18.350
sometimes it's weird where it doesn't actually trim as much.

1522
01:34:18.351 --> 01:34:23.351
Like I see some hairs in the same spot and I go back with the razor and the

1523
01:34:23.481 --> 01:34:27.570
razor won't do it.
I have to like get clippers and razor to make it present.

1524
01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:28.960
<v 4>I haven't really talked about,</v>

1525
01:34:30.150 --> 01:34:33.170
but I've been doing something kind of weird lately.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1526
01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:36.690
Like I've been growing at real long and then braiding it.
That's cool.

1527
01:34:36.810 --> 01:34:38.340
I've got a little braids with little beads in it.
Yeah.

1528
01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:40.660
<v 0>That's awesome.
Yeah.
It's just kind of something for you.</v>

1529
01:34:40.690 --> 01:34:44.700
Braid from the top so that like the braids hanging over your junk.
Yeah,

1530
01:34:44.701 --> 01:34:48.310
there's like a multicolored and then do people part the brain does that.

1531
01:34:48.530 --> 01:34:52.960
I mean it's just,
it's just for myself.
It's not really for,
for anybody else.

1532
01:34:52.961 --> 01:34:57.380
Anyone else.
And do you braid the,
the sac and the taint hair as well?

1533
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:00.020
<v 3>It's all braids.
Different guides and things.</v>

1534
01:35:00.021 --> 01:35:03.520
And I'm amazed at the length of some of my taint hair.
Yeah.

1535
01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:08.640
Like it's more like grout and he always wants me to look at scrum and talking

1536
01:35:08.931 --> 01:35:13.220
about that.
And the thing is,
it's such a request that Tom,

1537
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:16.580
oh stop.
Don't ask him that.
His sweet girls here.

1538
01:35:16.581 --> 01:35:18.790
She doesn't want you asking him this.

1539
01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:24.790
<v 4>She might want to know.
I don't know.
No.
Uh,
no.</v>

1540
01:35:25.870 --> 01:35:30.480
You may have just opened up a Pandora's box.
There you go.
You know,
does she have,

1541
01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:35.540
<v 3>do you ever ask that somebody or lady play with your self or no,</v>

1542
01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:39.940
<v 4>I have not.
Uh,
requested that.
Okay.
No.</v>

1543
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.970
How have you guys been dating?

1544
01:35:42.430 --> 01:35:43.263
<v 9>Uh,</v>

1545
01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:47.100
<v 3>a few months.
Okay.
Oh,
it's coming up.
Okay.
I got you.</v>

1546
01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:51.300
I got from my vapes or new love.
They don't do this nasty shit.

1547
01:35:51.330 --> 01:35:55.260
That's when that nasty shit happens.
Yeah.
But Times like Tom Cruise,
a nice man.

1548
01:35:55.261 --> 01:35:59.040
He doesn't Fart in front of women.
I'm guessing you're not gross like that.

1549
01:35:59.350 --> 01:36:01.620
<v 4>Uh,
I don't make like I try,</v>

1550
01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:05.950
I do try to not fart in front of people.
It's very nice.

1551
01:36:08.010 --> 01:36:12.130
But um,
yeah,
that's,
that's something I try to avoid doing.

1552
01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:13.650
<v 3>Well,
my husband's the opposite,</v>

1553
01:36:13.730 --> 01:36:18.240
but we were like a month into dating and he was sitting in his boxer shorts and

1554
01:36:18.241 --> 01:36:22.110
he put my hand in his crotch and farted on my hand.
It's a one month,

1555
01:36:22.111 --> 01:36:24.660
then that's 14 years.
Might have been a couple months in.
Yeah.

1556
01:36:24.661 --> 01:36:27.870
Well maybe is that when you knew this was Jesus Christ?

1557
01:36:27.871 --> 01:36:32.871
I know now at the moment you do that might say more about you then it says

1558
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:36.930
low self esteem.

1559
01:36:36.931 --> 01:36:39.840
I advocate for you could have made the choice to just leave immediately.

1560
01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:45.060
Did Not do that to me around there are so many red flags that I ignored about

1561
01:36:45.061 --> 01:36:48.440
you.
He loves murder shows.
Do you watch murder shows?

1562
01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:53.360
<v 4>Uh,
like you know,
like the,
where they're solving the,
the,
the on the,
yeah.</v>

1563
01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:56.600
Yeah.
I watch those sometimes.
Yeah.
What's your favorite thing to watch?

1564
01:36:58.370 --> 01:36:59.203
<v 9>Uh,</v>

1565
01:37:01.140 --> 01:37:04.170
<v 4>my favorite thing to watch.
Well,
let's see.
Um,</v>

1566
01:37:05.780 --> 01:37:06.613
<v 9>yeah,</v>

1567
01:37:06.730 --> 01:37:09.130
<v 4>I watch Netflix.
I was watching like,
you know,
look,</v>

1568
01:37:09.131 --> 01:37:11.160
the shot the show the last few years,
I know,

1569
01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:13.090
looks probably shows people watched already,

1570
01:37:13.091 --> 01:37:16.630
like house of cards or like house of cards.
I guess you can't like that in horse.

1571
01:37:16.810 --> 01:37:20.950
Uh,
and breaking bad.
I,
I binge watched that.
Do you like better call Saul?

1572
01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:25.000
Yeah,
but I haven't seen that all yet cause so good.
Yeah.
I,
but I do,

1573
01:37:25.001 --> 01:37:28.600
I do a do like that,
a lot of what I want that's,
I've been meaning to watch that.

1574
01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:34.020
I honestly have not really been watching much television.

1575
01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:36.700
Uh,
lately I kind of watched,
see,

1576
01:37:36.710 --> 01:37:41.710
I was watching CNN basically unloop for about the last seven years and then this

1577
01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:47.050
year I kind of stopped watching it.
Like it's good to take a break from that,

1578
01:37:47.051 --> 01:37:52.030
cancelled my cable after the election.
Yeah.
Because I was just sort of,

1579
01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:56.880
uh,
over it and um,
and uh,

1580
01:37:58.140 --> 01:37:59.970
you know,
I kind of sort of felt like

1581
01:38:01.650 --> 01:38:04.350
I felt a little angry at CNN actually,

1582
01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:09.380
to be honest with you because I felt like the way they reported on,

1583
01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:11.700
you know,
not to get too political or anything,

1584
01:38:11.701 --> 01:38:15.120
but the way they reported on the election.
Yeah.
I believe,

1585
01:38:15.121 --> 01:38:19.080
like kind of influenced the outcome,
not just,
not just them,
but the entire media,

1586
01:38:19.081 --> 01:38:22.050
you know?
And it's sort of like angered me a little bit because you know,

1587
01:38:22.051 --> 01:38:25.230
when you're like,
when you work in television or you know,

1588
01:38:25.231 --> 01:38:26.610
when you've done a TV show,

1589
01:38:26.611 --> 01:38:30.210
which involves doing something shocking and then getting to people talk to talk

1590
01:38:30.211 --> 01:38:34.830
about it,
right.
You know,
you realize,
oh,
that's,
that's like a very real technique,

1591
01:38:34.831 --> 01:38:37.950
you know?
So that's what Trump was doing and that's what people are doing now.

1592
01:38:37.951 --> 01:38:41.040
It's like say something shocking and then the media,
which you,

1593
01:38:41.140 --> 01:38:45.570
you think would be like kind of aware of what was going on,

1594
01:38:45.870 --> 01:38:50.500
would maybe like report on things a little more.
Uh,
you know,
uh,

1595
01:38:50.970 --> 01:38:54.900
I don't,
I just feel like the way they,
they,
they took advantage of that,

1596
01:38:55.470 --> 01:38:58.410
not for the sake of journalism,
but for the sake of ratings,
you know?

1597
01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:01.980
And that's just sort of really bothered me because I used to,
I actually,

1598
01:39:02.010 --> 01:39:06.870
I actually used to think that CNN was like really reporting the news,

1599
01:39:06.871 --> 01:39:11.730
you know?
And now I sort of,
I definitely like have kind of,
I took me a while to,

1600
01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:14.300
to come to that conclusion that the Nomo it's,
they're just,

1601
01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:17.090
they're just in the ratings game thing.
I should have figured that out.

1602
01:39:17.250 --> 01:39:19.200
Jay sensationalizing things.

1603
01:39:19.201 --> 01:39:23.160
I don't think I quite wanted to believe that for most of my,

1604
01:39:23.670 --> 01:39:25.350
most of my life.
You know,
I thought,
oh no,

1605
01:39:25.351 --> 01:39:28.080
they're reporting the news and this is important that we know all this stuff.

1606
01:39:28.081 --> 01:39:32.320
And I think,
I think after nine 11 something happened in me where I,

1607
01:39:32.330 --> 01:39:34.130
because I'm a paranoid person.
Yeah.

1608
01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:40.100
I became extremely afraid that there was going to be some piece of news that I

1609
01:39:40.741 --> 01:39:44.940
didn't get quickly enough so that I would be like,
you know,
like,

1610
01:39:45.590 --> 01:39:48.600
you know,
oh,
I don't have any water in the house,
you know,

1611
01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:51.950
so I'm not like a conspiracy I,
or like a,
you know,

1612
01:39:51.951 --> 01:39:56.160
a hoarder or like a doomsday prepper or anything like that.
But like,

1613
01:39:56.161 --> 01:39:59.490
I just kinda like felt like I needed to know immediately.
So I've,

1614
01:39:59.491 --> 01:40:04.110
I've had CNN literally unloop for like 10 years after nine 11 saying like sort

1615
01:40:04.150 --> 01:40:06.390
of.
I assume you'd want to miss like,
eh.
Yeah,

1616
01:40:06.391 --> 01:40:09.420
I just wanted to know first I like to stop watching television.
Really?

1617
01:40:11.610 --> 01:40:13.620
I watch a lot of,
oh,
here we go.

1618
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:17.960
I like how open Laden's looking in the camera to look right in the camera.

1619
01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:21.420
See what I'm doing.
I stopped watching.
I'm a big news junkie.

1620
01:40:21.610 --> 01:40:26.060
I've dialed it down way a lot in the last few years.
It's a pill,

1621
01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:29.010
it's shy,
it's fake manufactured.
It shines.

1622
01:40:29.011 --> 01:40:34.011
Like everything is like Tmz to cancel my cable.

1623
01:40:34.410 --> 01:40:39.210
And uh,
I enjoyed,
I enjoyed that.
Um,
but uh,

1624
01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:40.910
I watch a lot of,
uh,
a lot.

1625
01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:45.330
I watched a lot of rap videos on youtube if you'd like to see like the current

1626
01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:46.360
state of wraps.

1627
01:40:46.361 --> 01:40:51.361
So I like little pump and just wild out there and I like a juice swirled juice

1628
01:40:52.471 --> 01:40:54.040
world is hilarious.
I never

1629
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:55.510
<v 3>would have pegged you as a rap guy.</v>

1630
01:40:55.540 --> 01:40:58.420
I like to stay on top of what's happening with the rap world.

1631
01:40:59.050 --> 01:41:02.030
A lot of beefs out there,
man.
Yeah,
Drake and Pusha T.
Yeah.

1632
01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:04.930
What'd you think of that beef?
That was pretty,
you know,
it was some interesting,

1633
01:41:04.931 --> 01:41:09.020
interesting.
Did you see Drake on the Bron?
Yeah,
that was interesting.

1634
01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:12.730
Talk to me about about the,
uh,
the level,

1635
01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:14.800
like the degree to which,
you know,

1636
01:41:14.830 --> 01:41:19.830
Kanye went to them to Wyoming be friended him and worked on the song together,

1637
01:41:20.350 --> 01:41:23.430
got all this information and then turn it,
you know,

1638
01:41:23.450 --> 01:41:27.580
Jujitsu that right against him.
That was really fucked up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Not Nice.

1639
01:41:27.581 --> 01:41:32.320
Not Nice to our Canadian.
Uh,
that was a really fucked up man.
But you know,

1640
01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:37.630
looks like a,
he's a bit of a fucked up guy.

1641
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:41.620
I think so.
Yeah.
I don't want to forget this because we've got a,
we have to uh,

1642
01:41:41.650 --> 01:41:45.130
wrap pretty stuff,
right?
I've got to go pick up that a older kid kid to pick up.

1643
01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:49.630
But look,

There we go.
Yeah.
Look at that.
I'm so happy.

1644
01:41:49.631 --> 01:41:53.470
By the way,
the idea of a Tom Green show coming back.

1645
01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:55.600
I really think that happened.
I'm trying to make it,

1646
01:41:55.601 --> 01:42:00.010
I'm trying to make it happen so you can see him at the comedy connection.

1658
01:42:39.670 --> 01:42:42.220
I've been going through and I've been re editing them,

1659

not just taking clips but I've been reedited them into like condensed one minute

1664
01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:21.980
I said these two on the PA Nancy,
some crazy.
Got Damn asking him to leave.

1665
01:43:22.570 --> 01:43:26.170
This is 1995 looked almost exactly like me doing it.

1666
01:43:26.171 --> 01:43:29.080
Actually it all he did was he picked this thing up.

1667
01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:35.330
I am allowed to leave cause I'm an a Donald cause you weren't invited.

1668
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:37.710
We used to run,
the first place they get on a PA system was,

1669
01:43:37.711 --> 01:43:40.870
I personally invited it in the store.
First of all the supplies.
Okay,

1670
01:43:40.871 --> 01:43:44.190
well I'm going to leave him.
No,
I can charge you with trespassing.
Well No,

1671
01:43:44.250 --> 01:43:46.040

No,

1672
01:43:46.210 --> 01:43:48.880

Wow.

1677
01:44:09.140 --> 01:44:11.060
I hope I didn't talk too much about myself.

1678
01:44:11.090 --> 01:44:16.070
No Man wants to hear you talking about yourself.
We'll leave you with this.

1679
01:44:16.071 --> 01:44:20.090
It's a come back again.

1681
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:26.100
<v 8>Oh,
is that all scoring?</v>

1682
01:44:31.890 --> 01:44:32.960
Showing him?

1683
01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:40.620
I don't like taking pills,
but I have found something that works.

1684
01:44:42.410 --> 01:44:43.490
Australian dream,

1685
01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:51.513
breezy,

1686
01:44:59.910 --> 01:45:02.230
breezy,
plain.
I don't like

1687
01:45:08.450 --> 01:45:12.730
spreading
the word.

1688
01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:29.370
I don't like taking pills,
but I have found something that works.

1689
01:45:29.570 --> 01:45:32.230
What is it?
Australian dream.
