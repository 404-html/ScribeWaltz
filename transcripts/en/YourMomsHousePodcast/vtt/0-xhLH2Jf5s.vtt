62
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.733
Okay.

63
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.730
<v 0>Can I be sincere for a moment?</v>

64
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.300
So these past three weeks of shows have just been outrageously fun for me.

65
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.630
Great.
I mean,

66
00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:13.650
I just want to say thanks to the people have come out Charlotte fans,

67
00:05:13.651 --> 00:05:17.580
you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Charlotte man,
friend,
disco and Jude or Teddy's.

68
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.230
Yeah,
Keller.
Then just killer fund for me,
man,
really fast.

69
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.580
We have the best fans that run that.
I just did have one nighters.
Yeah,

70
00:05:25.581 --> 00:05:30.000
it was like bananas fun.
Everybody I met after the shows was a huge,

71
00:05:30.001 --> 00:05:31.710
your mom's house.
You're right about that.

72
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.800
And not only are we just saying that you don't understand how often,

73
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.870
like on these all the time,

74
00:05:36.871 --> 00:05:41.280
but even these last three weeks where that shows have been packed and that the

75
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.240
staff and management goes,
you bring out the best that they say that to me too.

76
00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:49.050
Yeah.
Your fans are the best test.
They're like,
they know they're polite.

77
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.690
They're intelligent.
Yeah.
They're ranking,

78
00:05:51.691 --> 00:05:55.530
their tipping people are civilized people.
They just can't believe it.

79
00:05:55.531 --> 00:06:00.440
So I just want to say,
because,
um,
it is really fun to be able to go out,

80
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.220
do your shows that you know,
that you,
that you do,

81
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.910
but have just great crowds supporting you.
So yeah.
Thanks everybody.

82
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.080
<v 2>Some updates on indie and sensee,
but I,
after we get into this first all,</v>

83
00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:15.880
we can do this for a,
we'll get into this then a little bit.
Okay.
Um,

84
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.910
do you know what I love?
Is it fif just had a kissy attack?
Yeah.

85
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.330
Like sometimes he just goes,
okay.
Me.
Yeah.

86
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.440
And then he demands and I pick him up and now he's resting his,

87
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.410
his chin on my arm.
He's such a sweet boy.
I want to clone him too.

88
00:06:28.411 --> 00:06:32.380
Before I know you guys right now,
25 grand,

89
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.350
is that all to clone your favorite dog?
Kind of worth it when you think about it,

90
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.260
I think when you,
but the thing is their personality won't be the same.

91
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.540
Are you sure that's what they said?
Well,
I mean how could it be if it's a clown?

92
00:06:44.541 --> 00:06:46.920
Because he doesn't have the same experiences though it doesn't have the same

93
00:06:46.921 --> 00:06:48.730
trauma.
Right?
It's like people.

94
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.810
<v 0>So what we could do is get the clone.
Yeah.</v>

95
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.150
And then just send them like give them to a real bad family for it.

96
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.920
<v 2>Send him to a kill shot.
We'll pay them more to,
he'll be like,</v>

97
00:06:58.921 --> 00:07:02.160
we'll give you another 25 grand you,

98
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.880
she'd be shitty for a few years and then we'll get him.

99
00:07:05.881 --> 00:07:10.560
So then will be 50,000 in and then like we'll get him like all skid it back.

100
00:07:10.561 --> 00:07:13.090
Right guys,
they'll beef experience again if the fever,

101
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:17.520
the total fee of experience and he has to get sick with like for viruses.

102
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.700
The minute we get at,
I don't even remind,

103
00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.980
remember how they lied to us that the kill shelter and they go,

104
00:07:22.981 --> 00:07:26.640
he just has the Doggie hooping cough,
wherever the fuck that's called.

105
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.730
And we took him home and he had about four viruses.
It was terrible,

106
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.910
terrible,
terrible dog on what?
We took the dog to the pet hospital and they,

107
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.950
they had a sign a do not resuscitate,
Redo it.
No,
but listen to it.
But the bright,

108
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.330
the bride,
you know,

109
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.690
thing at the end of the tunnel is that he's the best dog and he's happy and

110
00:07:45.691 --> 00:07:50.691
healthy and none of that mattered because he's the best now to Nieto.

111
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.290
No,
no,
no,
no.
You don't want to go there and not yet.
Not yet.
Okay.

112
00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:00.000
<v 0>Past weekend judo titties,
I was with full charge,
love,
full charge.</v>

113
00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:02.890
Uh,
so Thursday we do our third.

114
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.920
<v 2>Is He still doing his podcast?
The full charge power hour as far.
Well,
you know,</v>

115
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.510
it's funny you ask because he is on the

116
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:13.400
<v 0>road right now I'm doing a bunch of road gigs,</v>

117
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.000
so you should check them out online,
follow them on Twitter or whatever.

118
00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:19.460
If you haven't,
I know he's got a bunch of gigs coming up.

119
00:08:19.461 --> 00:08:24.230
Like what you're doing Raleigh together this week and you call it Raleigh crawl

120
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.150
on me.
Yeah.
So,

121
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:31.180
but we did our Thursday show and afterwards we had dinner with Eric Schaefer.

122
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:39.660
Um,
that was airy areas.
Great.
How's his butt hole?

123
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:44.080
I think it's fine.
He's shooting a special and a couple of weeks again.
Geez,

124
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.540
I'm really ambitious idea to what's the idea?

125
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.350
It's a like a almost like a half and half.

126
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:56.380
Like he was like 40 minutes on one subject and he drops a sheet or something,

127
00:08:56.911 --> 00:09:00.460
changes shirts and was 40 minutes on another subject.
Cool.
Yeah,

128
00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:03.230
that'll be interesting.
That's what I'm saying.
It's an ambitious idea.

129
00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.260
Where is it going to go?
Do we know?
I Dunno.
I think it's going to comedy central.

130
00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.630
I mean he's part of the network,
you know,

131
00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:14.130
cause he has this thing there so it's always going to be there I think.

132
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.400
But yeah,
I'm really happy for,
he's going to be in Austin.

133
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.330
I don't know if there's still tickets available,
but if you,
if you can get them,

134
00:09:21.331 --> 00:09:25.530
he'll be at cap city doing the special.
Um,
so I did a podcast with him too,

135
00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:29.190
but on Thursday we just,
we did Matt and I did the show.

136
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:33.090
We go meet airy Schaefer for dinner.
We have dinner,

137
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:38.700
then he's got,
uh,
a spot at the cellar.
So Matt and I were like,
well,

138
00:09:38.701 --> 00:09:42.210
go ahead.
You know,
we're,
we're just,
we're having new whatever,

139
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:46.440
post dinner drink or something,
you know.
So,
and he texts me,
he goes,

140
00:09:46.441 --> 00:09:49.710
come over [inaudible] we're,
we're,
you're not far from us,
so just walk over.

141
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.320
It's a nice walk.
So we're like,
all right,
we'll walk over.

142
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.100
So we're walking down bleaker street,
heading towards,
uh,

143
00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.430
the seller and the most amazing,

144
00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:04.431
wonderful thing happens that door to a bar opens and a fight.

145
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.170
Two guys spill out on the street.
Something so exciting about fights,

146
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:14.940
you know,
and you know,
I don't like,
I don't want to see brutal violence.
Like,

147
00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:19.530
I don't want to see someone's head kicked open and see them have a seizure.

148
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:24.620
But just a fight.
A battle,
like a bar drunk fight.
Yeah.
We're like,
you know,

149
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.830
a good shot,
a good punch.
I,
you know,
like I said,
I don't want to see devastation,

150
00:10:28.831 --> 00:10:33.540
but a fight is exciting because it's something primal about special.

151
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:37.680
Yeah.
And it makes you feel alive.
It does.

152
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:43.020
You get a little adrenaline rush fighting myself.
Right.

153
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:47.520
But I like other people.
Well it's like,
you know,
uh,
any fight,
like,
you know,

154
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:50.130
if you,
if you drive by and there's a fight,
you,
you stop.

155
00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:55.140
If there's a fight somewhere like down the street in Beverly Hills and there was

156
00:10:55.441 --> 00:10:59.730
us right in the middle,
the middle of the rough day or something,
they're like,

157
00:10:59.731 --> 00:11:00.630
wait,
who's fighting?

158
00:11:00.631 --> 00:11:05.631
I met a member as we crossed the light lights behind us were like,

159
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:07.020
they don't do that.

160
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:11.220
Most neighborhoods where like there was a fight for 30 seconds and then police

161
00:11:11.221 --> 00:11:14.220
were there in Beverly Hills.
It's kind of like that,
you know,

162
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.040
whole con thing that people talk about.
Well,
you know,

163
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.980
how about why don't you respond like this in bad neighborhoods?
And it's like,

164
00:11:19.981 --> 00:11:24.120
well in Rampart we also heard a lot of fighting and never showed up.

165
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:28.040
I was fine.
They can have,
they shown their helicopter lights in her own right,

166
00:11:28.041 --> 00:11:31.790
but not,
yeah,
he never actually showed up physically.
Anyways,

167
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.120
these two guys are fighting and you know,
it's,
it's sloppy fighting.

168
00:11:36.121 --> 00:11:39.400
It's sloppy
guys.

169
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.350
You got to do the demographics.
Yeah,
I mean I think uh,

170
00:11:43.351 --> 00:11:48.030
I would say one guy was like 25 thin,
um,

171
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.510
you know,
clean cut,
real,
real slender build.

172
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:55.060
The other guy was huskier bigger,

173
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.760
stronger build and it seemed like the Husky,

174
00:11:57.761 --> 00:12:02.761
your guy was really actually composed and clearly the other guy was drunk and it

175
00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:05.770
seemed to be the type of thing.

176
00:12:05.771 --> 00:12:09.340
Have you gotta get Outta here for whatever you just did in there?

177
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.700
The skinny guy did something.
Yeah,
the skinny guy did something bad.

178
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.200
Cause usually guys,

179
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.710
you guys are very primal and we put together that the skinny guy name was Ivan,

180
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.870
but men are very primal.

181
00:12:19.871 --> 00:12:24.130
Like you've told me that you'll walk into a room and even unconsciously size up

182
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:27.460
guys.
Guys do it all the time.
But women don't,

183
00:12:27.461 --> 00:12:31.030
we don't walk into a room and we do it on beauty in social settings.
Yes.

184
00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:31.900
And social settings.

185
00:12:31.901 --> 00:12:36.340
Women figure out where they are and the beauty scale and men figure out where

186
00:12:36.341 --> 00:12:40.080
they are on the physical strength is the strongest in here.

187
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:45.280
Even without going into it like,
hey,
it's unconscious.
You just gauge it.
Yeah.

188
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:50.260
So it seemed like Ivan was being like,

189
00:12:50.261 --> 00:12:50.651
dude,

190
00:12:50.651 --> 00:12:55.390
and he was being really hard re restrained and he was fighting back really hard,

191
00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.600
not like really throwing punches,
but it was a lot of shoving.

192
00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:02.540
He tore part of the other guy's shirt and it was,
it was very aggressive.

193
00:13:02.541 --> 00:13:06.280
It's fun.
So as that happened,
three or four other guys come out.

194
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:10.840
One is an old guy who's probably,
I would say when I say old,

195
00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:14.590
I mean well over 60.
Okay.
A white hair and you know,

196
00:13:14.591 --> 00:13:19.420
he's formally dressed.
Um,
and then two other guys,

197
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:24.230
including the one black guy.
And as we're walking,
I,

198
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:29.600
I think I'm on the phone with you,
right?
Yeah,
I heard it from here.
Yeah.

199
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:33.880
Uh,
so,
or are,
or you called as was half forget.
So yeah,

200
00:13:33.881 --> 00:13:37.860
you do call it a moment after.
I just want to say hi.

201
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.980
So you hadn't talked,
you hadn't called just yet.
So as we're walking though,

202
00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.900
um,
Matt goes,
Hey,
do you know who that black eyes?

203
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.190
And I go,

204
00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:52.780
who keep in mind we're 20 to 35 feet away.

205
00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.030
I go,
he goes,
Oh hey,
that's this Cuba Gooding Jr.
And I go,
yeah,
like I,

206
00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:03.400
I giggle like I heard you say that and then I too went,
okay.
Right.
Anyway,

207
00:14:03.401 --> 00:14:05.450
so what else did you guys do tonight?
Yeah,
yeah,

208
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.170
but I'm saying you heard it after.
This is not at the time.

209
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:12.820
So at the time you have,
I haven't,
I'm not talking to you yet.
So I go,
yeah.

210
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.420
And I thought he was just making like,
you know,

211
00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.070
like if there's an Asian guy and you go,
hey,
that's Mister Miyagi.
Okay.

212
00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.950
Like I thought you just making like a bad racial joke,
like just a throwaway.

213
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.780
And then he turns around and it's Cuba Gooding jr and I was like,
Holy Shit.

214
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.430
And he is really in the mix of this thing,
splitting this up.

215
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:38.710
Dude.
Ivan went in and out multiple times.

216
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:40.990
They finally dragged him halfway down the street.

217
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.730
I see the old guy as he's trying to restrain him,
hit the pavement,

218
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:50.380
which is terrible.
Nothing like seeing an old person fall.
It's just terrible.

219
00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:51.950
And then I see Cuba

220
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:56.570
<v 2>Cuba's,
yeah,
it's such a weird name.
Cuba.
Cuba comes back and he goes,</v>

221
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:01.220
I'll tell you,
he's not a boxer.
He goes,
can't keep that Chin down man.

222
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.810
And then he goes back inside,
comes out like three times.

223
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:10.190
Then you call like as the second time he's walked out and I go,

224
00:15:10.191 --> 00:15:13.820
we just saw Cuba Gooding jr break up a fight.
And we're like,
okay.

225
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:17.660
The same way I did.
And then I had to give the phone to Matt,
so I was like,

226
00:15:17.661 --> 00:15:21.440
I'm serious.
And then you talked to Matt and he was like,
no,
it's really true.

227
00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:25.460
Can we go to junior's breaking up fights on the streets of the Lower East

228
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.220
village here?
Crazy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's really,

229
00:15:28.221 --> 00:15:31.190
really weird because so New York that,
you know what I mean,

230
00:15:31.191 --> 00:15:35.150
that you like walking down the street actually more la like to have a huge

231
00:15:35.151 --> 00:15:38.450
celebrity be in a weird place like that.
I Dunno.

232
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.220
I feel like that's a very New York thing too.

233
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.280
The fighting is definitely New York cause I heard it in the background but

234
00:15:43.281 --> 00:15:46.500
celebrities are all over in New York.
They just walk around over there too.

235
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.230
I had my first Paparazzi experience.

236
00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.940
You did take a picture of your no,

237
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.700
the video guys like the TMZ.
Yeah.
But it happened.

238
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:59.630
It happened in the best possible way.
It happened without a doubt.

239
00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:03.500
Well with them not wanting to get me,

240
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:08.310
what happened was this,
I get out of a car,
like a car service car and as I'm,

241
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:11.270
the driver gives me my bags,
I'm walking to my hotel,

242
00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:15.860
a guy in a car opens the door like a parked car and he goes,

243
00:16:15.861 --> 00:16:20.090
Tom Secura and I go,
what's up man?
He goes,
dude,
I love your stuff.
And I go,

244
00:16:20.091 --> 00:16:22.550
thanks man.
And then the pop rock to pop rocks.

245
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:25.790
You guys looked at each other and I go,
what's up man?
You guys are here for me.

246
00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:28.710
Right?
And they're like,
yeah.
And I go,
nobody more famous.
It's coming up.

247
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.350
That was it.
[inaudible] interview with TMZ.
I mean I just walked into the hotel.

248
00:16:33.351 --> 00:16:35.940
It wasn't going to stay there and talk to guys that I knew are not there to,

249
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.910
to video,
but they were waiting.

250
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.120
There were some musician or something at the hotel.
Wow.

251
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:44.330
I think it was like a pop star.
So they,
they were all camped out.

252
00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:49.340
Oh Wow.
Well it sounds like you had a star studded east coast adventure.

253
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:54.350
I know I saw a celebrity to in Indianapolis in Indianapolis,
Indiana.

254
00:16:54.351 --> 00:16:59.030
Apple tits where,
who?
Famous to our show a little Yoshi.

255
00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.770
Oh,
he is very famous.

256
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:06.490
Yoshi Obayashi is very famous and your mom's house circles and he was in

257
00:17:06.501 --> 00:17:11.501
Indianapolis of all weird things and he did a guest set on my show jerking off

258
00:17:12.351 --> 00:17:15.950
while licking my,
having a girl,
like my boss from my angle,

259
00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:19.490
while she's licking my balls,
I'm punching her fucking stupid face.
Yeah,

260
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:20.540
that's Yoshi.

261
00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:25.540
And we went for lunch after the next day with like two normal friends of his,

262
00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:29.240
like a married couple.
Weird.
Right.

263
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:34.070
It's super weird and I just think the Jews are great.
Right.

264
00:17:34.071 --> 00:17:34.550
And um,

265
00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:39.550
it was just weird to see Yoshi having functionally like good relationships with

266
00:17:39.621 --> 00:17:44.360
these people and they were the nicest and we had a lovely meal and he's doing

267
00:17:44.361 --> 00:17:49.100
stand up and just traveling around a lot.
And he says that,
uh,

268
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:54.330
your mom's house fans give him the most love of all the podcasts that he's done

269
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:57.900
when he,
when he,
when,
when he came up on my show bananas,

270
00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.560
they went bananas for his Legendary Status Ledge if he did it.

271
00:18:01.561 --> 00:18:04.600
Now when we move and we are equipped for guests.
Really?
Yeah.

272
00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.400
We got to have him on again.
Yeah,

273
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:10.460
I told him we would once the studio is a new one,
so this is too small in Africa.

274
00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.920
Sucks.
Um,
but yeah,

275
00:18:13.921 --> 00:18:17.190
so he's doing great and it was such a trip to see him.

276
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:22.050
And I went back to Cincinnati and I tried building another fart.

277
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:26.730
I went to skyline Chili,
I aid at Applebee's.

278
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.660
But I don't think anything can compare to that fateful day.

279
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:36.660
Once in a lifetime recreate now it's like a double pipe.
Yeah.
Yeah.

280
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.460
Interesting.
So you know,
we both had celebrity sightings.

281
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:46.010
Both are famous Quba big deal.
Okay.
Yeah.

282
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:51.440
Original name.
So Cuba,
how old is Cuba now?
I Dunno,

he's got,

283
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:55.610
he's all 50 now.
Late forties.

284
00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:01.560
He's a old,
what am I going to say?
Head?
I in trouble every time.

285
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:06.450
You know what I'm going to say?
No,
I don't know.
There's an old joke.

286
00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.620
Oh,
it's an old joke.
Um,
all right.

287
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.000
So how can we get on to plant?
Um,
first of all,

288
00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:19.300
may I preface this by saying that you've done many things in Showbiz.

289
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:23.350
You've done a late night spots.
You've done Conan.
Yeah.

290
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.780
What else would be done in late,
late,
late night genre,
the late,
late,
late,

291
00:19:27.781 --> 00:19:32.130
late show with currency.
Um,
you've actually,

292
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.830
you've done counting as a standup and then you came back and you sat on the

293
00:19:34.831 --> 00:19:35.664
couch,

294
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:40.860
you did panel and both times or how many times you've done this stuff,

295
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.340
you've just been like,
oh yeah,
I'm doing Conan tonight.
No biggie.

296
00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:50.190
When I announced you that I was pregnant,
you were like,
that's neat.
No,
no biggie.

297
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:55.680
Um,
you going on this show,
you were ear to ear.
Look,
look at you now.

298
00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:59.020
This is,
this is like you watching Henry Portrait of a serial killer happened.

299
00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:04.770
You were so stoked to go on this show and you were so thrilled the day of and so

300
00:20:04.771 --> 00:20:08.320
thrilled days after.
I've never seen you this happy.
You don't.

301
00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:12.320
The only bummer is I tell you this now,
they cut out so much stuff.
Um,

302
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:14.870
he told me,
he's like,
oh,

303
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.560
there's no rules to whatever they are in the cuts that I've seen.

304
00:20:19.561 --> 00:20:22.560
I've got bleeped and they cut out like half.

305
00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.720
I know bad words more than anything.

306
00:20:24.721 --> 00:20:28.620
Like most people who learn a second language and so it was cursing a lot in

307
00:20:28.621 --> 00:20:30.710
Spanish.
Do they just straight up cutouts?

308
00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:34.050
Maybe they didn't think you were as much of a dirt bag as you are.

309
00:20:34.051 --> 00:20:38.280
I think that's the thing.
He's like normal people have no boundaries.
Yeah.

310
00:20:38.281 --> 00:20:41.970
Like he was saying things like,
it's like they go,
how were you at sports?

311
00:20:41.971 --> 00:20:44.810
And he goes,
oh I had like two left feet,
you know.
And they laughed.

312
00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:48.340
And then I was like I said in Spanish,
I said fuck,

313
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:52.790
<v 0>I was the fucking best.
And then cut out the weeds.
Yeah.</v>

314
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:56.830
They go beep and then they cut the rest of it.
Yeah.
Um,

315
00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.460
we were afraid of our Guatemalan nanny's mom saying,
yeah,

316
00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:05.650
I know cause she loves planting Ito and we were worried that she's going to
quit.

317
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.080
You do English and Spanish by the way,
on the show.

318
00:21:08.081 --> 00:21:11.050
What happens is normally if you're like me,

319
00:21:11.051 --> 00:21:16.000
they want you to speak English the whole time because the game kind of for them

320
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:19.350
is that there's an English speaker on and then kind of make fun of you and
stuff.

321
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.470
Well they,
they,

322
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:24.850
people wear ear pieces and they translate and it makes it like a clash of

323
00:21:24.851 --> 00:21:29.320
cultures.
Right.
So I do speak English and spent,
but I'll,
you'll see

324
00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.760
he's a Spanish actor from Mexico.

325
00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:34.973
<v 4>Oh,
okay.</v>

326
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:39.190
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

327
00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:44.810
<v 0>beeps already right out of the gate.
I said,
no ma'am,
it's way,</v>

328
00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:49.370
which is like,
you gotta be like,
like don't fuck with me.
Like say it again.

329
00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:53.420
You gotta be kidding me.
No Mommy,
no mommy.
And then I said,
well Diane,

330
00:21:53.421 --> 00:21:55.920
say Linda and they excellent.

331
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:58.770
So they blink my mess and then they bleed.

332
00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:03.930
But why put the excellent and it does like Buddha is like a,

333
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:07.610
they say it.
Yeah,
it's horror.
But in,

334
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.680
in Peru it's said as a word of like emphasis,
like kind of old glory.

335
00:22:12.681 --> 00:22:17.390
But it's like if he's like you said,
how good were you at sports in high school?

336
00:22:17.391 --> 00:22:20.930
And I went,
Fuck.
Awesome.
Okay.
It was like that.
So I'm saying like,

337
00:22:20.931 --> 00:22:24.790
fuck excellent.
So great that I cleaned it.

338
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.360
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

339
00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:33.070
<v 0>he's like looking over at his producer,
like,
look at this guy.</v>

340
00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:36.860
This guy's the best.
Yeah,
this guy is ear to ear smiles the whole time.

341
00:22:36.861 --> 00:22:40.320
He's all energy cause that's Latin,
uh,

342
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:45.330
show pop up.
Big expression.
Sabido he got,

343
00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:50.050
there's a picture on my Instagram of when I'm on this and they're there,

344
00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:52.610
I'll show you what they're doing.
But him in the background,

345
00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.590
it's somebody wrote like,

346
00:22:54.591 --> 00:22:58.870
I've never been that happy as that guy is this guy because he gets,
yeah,

347
00:22:58.871 --> 00:23:03.110
he's just a very big,
big show emotion.

348
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.020
How much do you love your mother if you eat something of hers?

349
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:14.480
And she goes,
how is it?
And you go,
it's good.
It's good.
It's good.

350
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.470
Yeah,
you don't love it.
I go,
yeah,
no,
I love it.
But do you love it?
Love it.

351
00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:23.600
She gets mad at me cause I don't know.
He wants to know if your Lord,
I love you.

352
00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:25.640
I love you.
Love you.
Here's the next club.
Okay.

353
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.860
<v 3>Okay.
When I was at,
when I was a kid,
I'll tell you this part,
in English,</v>

354
00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:29.973
when I was a kid,

355
00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:32.400
<v 4>I would go spend my summers in Lima,
right?</v>

356
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:37.550
So I would go to class and the teacher would see me without papers,

357
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:42.780
without books,
without pen,
because I was just visiting.
So one day in class,

358
00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:47.120
he goes a know,
like really mad,
right?
Whoa.

359
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:50.480
Why don't you have your books?
Oh,
he brings me to the front of the class.

360
00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:53.720
He makes me face the class and he tells them,

361
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.530
ask this kid why he doesn't have his books.

362
00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:01.850
So I say it's because I'm from getting gold land.
Yeah.
And I don't have my book.

363
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:05.780
And he said,
now you can ask him whatever you want.

364
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:10.310
So this kid goes to make fun of me to bully me.
He goes,
uh,

365
00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:14.350
[inaudible] basis.
How many times did I do man?

366
00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.920
I said the penis.
He [inaudible]

367
00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:22.240
<v 1>right.</v>

368
00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:26.140
<v 0>You're madre.
Cause I gotta say so basically the kid,
this is a true story.</v>

369
00:24:26.141 --> 00:24:29.950
They put me in front of the class.
It was like really shocking.
You know,

370
00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:32.860
I never heard this story.
Yeah.
So it was like the one of the,

371
00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:36.040
my first summer going to class and I would basically,

372
00:24:36.041 --> 00:24:39.100
I was in an all boys Catholic school.
You wore,
I wore the uniform and everything,

373
00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:40.203
but I didn't,

374
00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.900
I was a visitor and they just stuck me in classes and they're just like,

375
00:24:43.901 --> 00:24:48.100
just sit in the back.
Right.
So I didn't have papers and stuff on my desk.

376
00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.620
And most of the time nobody noticed.

377
00:24:50.621 --> 00:24:54.670
But one time a teacher looked at my desk and was like,
what are you doing?

378
00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:58.300
Like you don't have like who are you?
But at the end like,
you know,

379
00:24:58.301 --> 00:25:02.380
they address you like that it's more old school,
you know?
And

380
00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.880
<v 2>you mean they don't worry about your pronouns or if you're on a Vegan gluten
die,</v>

381
00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.840
microaggressions,
they go for extra aggression over aggression.
Yeah,

382
00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:15.810
<v 0>front of the class.
Imagine that and being a foreigner,
oh,
it's terrifying.</v>

383
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:17.250
Like heart racing.

384
00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.850
And then I started to tell him that someone jumped in and they're like,
he's,

385
00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:25.290
he's American student.
He's not even enrolled here.
And there.
He was like,
oh.

386
00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:29.730
And he's like,
well,
ask away,
kids,
ask,
ask him whatever you want.

387
00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:33.000
And the first kid goes,
how many times did they do you masturbate?

388
00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:36.210
And then teacher didn't correct nothing.
I think he was a,

389
00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:40.500
Pete wanted to see like what you're made of good.
I love,
but I answered the kid,

390
00:25:40.501 --> 00:25:43.350
I said,
it depends if I think of your mother like six or seven times.

391
00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.980
And then I said,
uh,
me,
Mason,
Mondo [inaudible],
which means,
uh,
they,

392
00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:52.430
they call me a dead hand cause I'm a jerk off so much.
Got It.
Yeah.

393
00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:54.300
And uh,
anyways,

394
00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:57.690
it killed in the class and then there was a little bit of fucking around and

395
00:25:57.691 --> 00:25:58.620
then went back to my seat.

396
00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:02.400
<v 2>See.
But I do like that old school academia stuff,</v>

397
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:06.060
like they're not respecting your pronouns are not worried at all.
No.
No.
Shame.

398
00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:08.550
Shame is a wonderful,
powerful tool.

399
00:26:08.551 --> 00:26:11.370
And it kind of didn't it make you a tougher,

400
00:26:11.371 --> 00:26:15.750
more resilient human of course honed your comedy skills.

401
00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:20.550
Need fear,
fear,
shame.
Yeah.
All wonderful motivator.
Anxiety.

402
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:24.300
Yeah,
but it all motivate me.
They cut out the thing,
you know,
they cut out.

403
00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:27.510
Well I'll beep now,
but they don't send tile.

404
00:26:27.511 --> 00:26:32.180
It's not like Pooka con nothing.
That'd be great if they still wrote it out.

405
00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.510
I know,
I know.

406
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:37.183
<v 1>I love the,</v>

407
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:41.680
<v 4>every week
he goes,</v>

408
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.970
I'll leave on us as he can with

409
00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.480
<v 5>[inaudible].</v>

410
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.980
<v 0>So here's the game.
They bring out this chick,</v>

411
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:52.700
she has objects inside her tight gold.

412
00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:00.850
So in this tight gold zip up suit,

413
00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:04.390
like just things like a coffee mug on a phone.

414
00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:08.890
And the whole idea is you're supposed to touch her right with your,
a blindfold.

415
00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.330
And also,
um,

416
00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.930
they have headphones and music playing on you and secret touching games.

417
00:27:12.931 --> 00:27:15.280
You could touch and games and you touch her and then you go.

418
00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.440
But it's supposed to be enticing because you're touching a right,

419
00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:22.000
a beautiful girl,
but is,
you're just,
you know what I love about Latin TV?

420
00:27:22.001 --> 00:27:25.420
It's so pervy.
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh,
I don't understand what's going on,

421
00:27:25.421 --> 00:27:29.530
but sometimes I just watch the Latin channel.
Yeah.
And it's all lecherous.

422
00:27:29.531 --> 00:27:33.760
It's like Benny Benny Hill show.
The best part too is that for the setup,

423
00:27:33.761 --> 00:27:37.690
but you don't see here,
they bring us out and they're like,
they're like,
hey,

424
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:42.890
like when you see her,
go ahead and react.
So that's your big reaction there.
Yeah.

425
00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:47.590
This is Tom's big reaction
and at,

426
00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:51.460
yeah.
Wow.
No,
but I did it.

427
00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:54.610
I did it Super Latin where I walked over and I went like,
whoa.

428
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.020
Like I like a big gesture and I was like,
oh,
la.

429
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.620
And I'm supposed to,
you're supposed to like just really Ogle or you know,

430
00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:05.110
so they're like,
all right fellas.
And then they tell us like,

431
00:28:05.111 --> 00:28:07.000
you're going to get to touch her everywhere.
Yeah.

432
00:28:07.001 --> 00:28:11.410
It's super pervy this is sexual harassment.
I totally,
um,

433
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.860
this is very,
uh,
UN-PC.
Yeah.
Yeah.

434
00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.380
So here's the

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:21.550
<v 5>he
eagles.
I live on us.</v>

436
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:27.030

437
00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:33.890
that you'll get through it.

438
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:39.060
<v 3>They bring out,

439
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:50.150

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:55.013
<v 3>Yes.</v>

453
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:11.320
<v 0>Okay.
Can you tell something about my board that looks different?
Zero.
No,</v>

454
00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:15.870
he's holding the board and the guy next to me,
oh,
what's all bleeped out?

455
00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:20.280
They blurt out my answers too because that's how vulgar I was.
Hilarious.

456
00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.030
One of them,
they blurt out a word,
one of them,

457
00:30:24.031 --> 00:30:28.620
they blurt out completely my answer.
Look,
what did you say?
Dildos?

458
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:33.750
No,
I said okay.
So the first one was um,
because I knew it was a dude.

459
00:30:33.751 --> 00:30:36.780
Okay.
So I go,
I was touching and I go,

460
00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:41.130
ah glassworks they linty which is like a great ass.

461
00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:44.460
And he said like in the room like,
cause you don't,
you wear headphones.

462
00:30:44.461 --> 00:30:47.160
He was like,
dude,
that killed.

463
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.510
But oh cause you can't even hear yourself talking to hear anything.

464
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:53.670
Then how do you know when he's like,
what do you feel?

465
00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:57.200
Cause they just tell you to keep guessing.
So before you go,
yeah,

466
00:30:57.201 --> 00:31:01.290
you're just like,
ah,
yeah.
So I was like [inaudible] and then I wait.

467
00:31:01.291 --> 00:31:06.060
Or You could hear laugh,
like kind of through the,
over the music you move on.

468
00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:09.920
So they believed that at or,
or they they,
they didn't even put it on answers.

469
00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:14.460
Well she told you to go for it and then TV.

470
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:19.550
Go for it maybe.
I guess so.
I guess I was way too vulgar.
Why Volcker?

471
00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.340
And then they,
they blurt out at test too.
He can

472
00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:28.710
like titties.
I said he's got small titties this fine.
You can tell.

473
00:31:28.711 --> 00:31:31.920
I tell him it was a dude anyways.
Right.
If they didn't hit you to it,

474
00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:35.070
the joke beforehand kind of thing.
You could tell it's a brow.

475
00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:50.800
<v 3>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

476
00:31:57.890 --> 00:31:58.723
<v 0>Oh fuck.</v>

477
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:15.070
I should have grabbed that coffee mug.
Have been like a huge cock.
You know,

478
00:32:15.071 --> 00:32:18.110
like in his pants they blurt out your answers.

479
00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:26.560
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

480
00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.550
<v 0>I will say planting Nieto has got a good look for a clown.</v>

481
00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:35.990
He's been doing it 40 years.
It looks really cool.
Actually.
My kids,

482
00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:38.480
the coloring he chooses,
I like the purple.

483
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:40.040
<v 3>I liked</v>

484
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.150
<v 0>the glitter guide.
Stock your game.</v>

485
00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:45.170
[inaudible] I [inaudible]

486
00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:50.890
I don't understand this.
I don't think people,
okay,

487
00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:53.440
so what they do is we're sitting at a table,

488
00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:57.970
three of us Lolo the actor,
the host splint that Nieto in me,

489
00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:03.250
and there's a Domino's on the table.
Huge ones,
uh,

490
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.810
with the,
the digits,

491
00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:10.050
the numbers face down and they spin the table around and then you turn over,

492
00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:13.450
you randomly pick and you flip it over at all at the same time.

493
00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:18.070
So loaded Lolo has the highest then and in me I have the lowest.

494
00:33:18.071 --> 00:33:20.470
That means I lose.
Okay,
so this is,
yeah.
Okay.

495
00:33:20.471 --> 00:33:22.630
It's just a silly like go fish and the loser.

496
00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:25.390
They pour a mug of beer down your pants.
Fun.

497
00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.730
So right now I just found out that I lost,

498
00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:36.470
<v 3>not a clown is going to put it down.

<v 2>This is like you peed your pants there.
Yeah.

502
00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:09.400

Is it?

503
00:34:09.401 --> 00:34:11.080
Do you get brain freeze on your Dick and balls?

504
00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:17.320

I dunno.
I mean we're talking about freezing cold,
everything.</v>

505
00:34:17.321 --> 00:34:20.890
Just kind of,
you know,
with that,
everything just shrinks more.
It really does.

506
00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:24.080
You just,

Just glass and glass and all of a sudden literally,

I'm like,

00:37:22.691 --> 00:37:27.070
That's how had super excited you were.
I was really excited.
Nothing excited.

549
00:37:27.071 --> 00:37:28.780
Do you like being?
And I,
and I mean that,

550
00:37:28.781 --> 00:37:31.000
I'm not just saying that for a jokey joke.
Yeah.

551
00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:34.310
You've done a lot of really cool things in your career.
I would,

552
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:38.530
you have never been excited.
Like you,
you just,
you're not at an excitement dude.

553
00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:42.010
But that show you are like,
what am I going to wear?
And you don't care.

554
00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.190
You've done specials.
We were like,
I don't know.
We're just,
I don't care.

555
00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:49.570
You've done late night.
We've done stuff.
Don't care.
And you were like,

556
00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.920
I have to look good.
I have to,
you know,
prepare.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's cute.

557
00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:57.850
Why do you think Quentin Ito held a special place in your heart?
Um,

558
00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:02.910
honestly I think it was because I've always wanted to do something Spanish,

559
00:38:05.591 --> 00:38:10.480
Latin based.
It's your,
it's your roots,
its roots and you know,

560
00:38:10.481 --> 00:38:15.000
I wanted like,
I want to be on Narcos,
I want to,
oh,
that'd be cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.

561
00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:19.300
So the idea of being even in that kind of world a little bit,
I don't know,

562
00:38:19.301 --> 00:38:23.740
it just,
it felt like your heritage.
Yeah.
I felt like it was like,
um,
uh,
maybe,

563
00:38:23.741 --> 00:38:26.520
I don't know.
It was like hanging out with cousins or something.
Right.

564
00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:31.100
I am the exact opposite.
I want nothing to do with the eastern bloc.

565
00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:37.120
I want nothing to do with,
yeah,
I stuck it with a much,
they believe me.

566
00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:41.170
Yeah.
Especially cause they gave me the green light.
They're like,
go for it.

567
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:45.390
They even said curse as much as you want.
That's odd then.
That's odd.
The,
yeah.

568
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:47.890
Well maybe they didn't think you'd go for it that hard.
Well,

569
00:38:47.891 --> 00:38:50.200
they told me to curse in English correctly.
Like say whatever you want.
They go,

570
00:38:50.201 --> 00:38:55.150
there's no rules here.
Oh,
I guess there were this guy's rad though.

571
00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:58.240
He's so please thank.
He doesn't,
he doesn't have sex though,
right?

572
00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:03.160
<v 7>We got out here.
This is why.</v>

573
00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:07.060
This is why.
What came up?
We've been slipping along.

574
00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:10.600
Does it pick your battle buddies long,
tall meadow.

575
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:15.870
We've been slipping along and just glass and just all of a sudden,

576
00:39:16.421 --> 00:39:19.450
literally,
I hadn't even helped me put my head on.
I'm like,
oh,

577
00:39:19.451 --> 00:39:21.040
we're just glassing.
He pick huge bedrooms.

578
00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:26.010
<v 2>Love it.
What's glasses?
No fucking clothes.
Not Canadian,
by the way.</v>

579
00:39:26.011 --> 00:39:29.820
Of course he is.
No,
he's not master of accents.
I think you're wrong.
Uh,

580
00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.160
that's definitely Canadian listeners.

581
00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:36.240
Canadian listeners verify that man is Canadian.
Absolutely.

582
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:40.440
Whole stalk the glass and along he's talks like a total Canuck

583
00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:45.880
<v 0>gloss little moles Gleason.
Who's,
Huh?
Okay.
Um,</v>

584
00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:48.080
let's see.
It says there's a bunch of stuff here.

585
00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:53.830
Glassing techniques plus a lock for spotting dear 10 top 10 glassing tips.

586
00:39:57.650 --> 00:40:01.850
Okay.
I guess it's a stalking thing by the best binoculars you can afford.

587
00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:04.820
The depth of field and clarity will be a huge difference.

588
00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:09.360
July and August are the best times to glass as the deer start each glassing

589
00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:13.850
session.
Cleaning your glass.
I guess it has to do with you.
Yeah.
Looking

590
00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:17.350
<v 2>glassing me meaning looking through the binoculars.
Yeah.</v>

591
00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:21.730
Glassing is looking at them now you realize how stoked this guy is off of

592
00:40:21.731 --> 00:40:22.600
killing deer.

593
00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:28.510
That's what he's stoked about is murdering a moose.
Moose.
Yeah.

594
00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:32.300
Mostly.
That's what this guy is so fired up about killings.
Just like you,

595
00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:35.920
you share something special with him.
Your love of killing.

596
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:39.390
I'm surprised you don't like to kill animals.
Why don't you go it?

597
00:40:39.391 --> 00:40:42.460
Will Joe Rogan ever invite you?
He's asked me.
He's invited me.

598
00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:47.260
I feel like you might find your true calling as a hunter and your thirst for

599
00:40:47.261 --> 00:40:52.030
blood needs to develop a little,
oh,
maybe I think you'll get that violence.

600
00:40:52.031 --> 00:40:55.960
Audi is the,
the anger and the rage.
That's secretly,
I don't want to listen to it.

601
00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:59.350
People have sent in the clip of Bill Burr and uh,

602
00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:03.970
Bert Kreischer calling you a psycho.
Yeah.
On Burke cast.
Yeah.
Bill burr was like,

603
00:41:03.971 --> 00:41:08.440
Tom's a big cycle here.
I think bill's the biggest psycho.
No,
I think he's right.

604
00:41:08.441 --> 00:41:12.700
I think you are bullshit.
New York.
Clearly a more than bill.

605
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:17.120
Bill's got a psycho pills.
Such a psycho
fill.

606
00:41:17.121 --> 00:41:21.220
Such a sales,
a little cautious,
cautious about things.

607
00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:25.720
But you're,
you're definitely more of a blood lust sort of guy.
I disagree.

608
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:30.040
Respectfully disagree.
I respectfully,
I'm not into hunting at all.

609
00:41:30.041 --> 00:41:32.530
Why would you suggest that?
Because I think that,

610
00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:36.620
and I'm not saying you can't believe you would put me ahead of him on the cycle.

611
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:41.650
I think you need to explore hunting to tap into the side of you that likes to

612
00:41:41.841 --> 00:41:42.740
kill this thirst.

613
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:46.820
That side of me that likes to kill laughs at Henry Portrait of a serial killer.

614
00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:50.720
The rageful beast that lurks inside needs the release.
Get outta here.

615
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:53.180
I don't like to kill animals yet.

616
00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.120
Maybe you can get a one sided about it.

617
00:41:56.150 --> 00:42:00.350
Is this guy is maybe if I were to eat them like Joe does,

618
00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:04.370
he puts it to use.
If you could hunt for your family.
Oh Man,
I dunno.

619
00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:07.910
I really don't.
Under the idea it does not.
It does not entice me at all.

620
00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:11.120
Not the blood or the stabbing.
Maybe going back to,

621
00:42:11.121 --> 00:42:13.940
I can't believe you're putting me ahead of billing on the cycle.
This,

622
00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:16.430
he's so clearly a psycho.

623
00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:20.450
Why is paranoid site psycho you thinking of the paranoia makes him more.

624
00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:25.460
I just have a conversation.
He's so much more fired up.
He's like a,
an angry rant,

625
00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:30.460
but I don't think he laughs at um,
murder.
You don't laugh.
Yeah.

626
00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:32.780
Yeah.
Okay.
If you don't laugh at other people,

627
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:36.530
other people's harm or killing.
I like show.

628
00:42:36.531 --> 00:42:39.740
If we showed bill that's that clip of Henry Portrait of a serial killer with a

629
00:42:39.741 --> 00:42:44.240
hooker gets her neck twisted and broken.
And if he doesn't laugh the way you did,

630
00:42:44.241 --> 00:42:47.000
I'd say that your,
your alarm isn't laugh at him killing her.

631
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:49.340
I laugh at the guy's reaction to Henry.

632
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:54.230
And what about the video of the guy's legs getting smushed by the car?

633
00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:57.830
I laughed at his reaction to getting smashed by a car.

634
00:42:58.130 --> 00:42:59.990
The cries of pain.
Yes,

635
00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:04.370
because they were comical and a lot of people agree that it was a funny
reaction.

636
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:05.263
Okay,

637
00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:08.920
but you're trying to paint me as a more of a cycle then that red headed freak

638
00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.550
getting me.
Yes.

639
00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:16.250
The best answer for glassing.
Looking at it through magnification,

640
00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.530
either vernaculars rifle scope.

641
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:23.530
Usually when the term has said it means look looking through binoculars.
Um,

642
00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:28.550
I'm not a bigger cycle.
I'm so offended by that.
Fucking ridiculous.

643
00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:30.110
You're ridiculous person.

644
00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:35.480
<v 7>Please just keep going.
Let's glass.
Let's glass glass,
glass.
And I'm like,</v>

645
00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:39.610
holy smokes,
I got to move.
So Canadians.
And I'm like,
oh man.

646
00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:43.550
I'm like,
no,
it's a cow.
The cow right there.

647
00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:48.390
<v 2>I've never had anybody that
so</v>

648
00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.820
hunting moose conversation,

649
00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:55.980
he's got such Garth like blood and him.
Yeah,

650
00:43:57.290 --> 00:44:01.150
dad or blood.
That's cool stuff.
Slick stuff.
Neat stuff.

651
00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.210
Here's the a,
the super cut.
Oh,
I love it.

652
00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:07.540
I have dad boner that Boehner the hunter.

653
00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:12.820
<v 7>We'd been slipping along here.
Just glassing.
Just glass,
glass,
glass,</v>

654
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:16.360
glass,
glass,
glass,
glass and I'm like

655
00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:26.310
just glassing.
We're just glassing.
It looks glass.

656
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.570
Let's glass glass on glass.
And I'm like

657
00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:36.030
<v 2>came in his pants.
Remember that Dad Boehner we saw today before we had lunch,</v>

658
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:41.190
dude,
we saw a guy walking down the street wearing light denim,

659
00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:45.690
like light,
light,
light,
light,
blue denim,
practically white denim,

660
00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:48.660
tight as fuck.
High up,
Brown,

661
00:44:48.661 --> 00:44:53.340
braided belt and then sandals with socks,
right?
Jeans.
Yeah.

662
00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:56.550
Yeah.
That's like the WAC is Dab.
Look ever.

663
00:44:56.790 --> 00:45:00.930
It is super whacked dude.
It is.
You want to be that like I'm really good.

664
00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:07.700
That's,
that's the noise that guy made.
I think when he,

665
00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:11.780
when he found out that this is question either that he spotted a mousse or that

666
00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:12.920
glass went down.

667
00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:22.520
Such a great,
yeah.

668
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:26.360
I liked the guy and the guy that got bitten by the snake and the cave a few

669
00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:30.470
weeks back.
I remember.
Yeah,
it was a good,
a big bite.
I'll go to bed.

670
00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:32.900
Bye Bye.
Bye Bye.

671
00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:37.730
<v 0>I've got a bad,
bad,
bad,
bad bite.
I got a bad,
bad by bad by bad bite.</v>

672
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:44.410
<v 2>I got a boob bite.
Who's just glass glasses,</v>

673
00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:48.200
<v 0>glass and keeping it glass e glass in a lot.</v>

674
00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:52.250
Um,
I don't know where that is.
I remember that guy was,

675
00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:56.000
<v 2>I go to bed bite.
That guy.
He has a bad bike.
I,</v>

676
00:45:56.150 --> 00:46:01.150
I don't remember all the Guano Guano blood everywhere.

677
00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:06.300
I'm cool.
No,
I'm knee deep in Guano and back one.
Oh,

678
00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:13.900
these hunting guys,
these outdoorsy types on a nightmare.

679
00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:17.170
Oh,
neat.
Even back one.
Okay.
What happens to,

680
00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.110
to men when they turn in the boners,

681
00:46:20.111 --> 00:46:23.740
like do you think he's always been a boner and then becoming a dad just makes

682
00:46:23.741 --> 00:46:25.860
you lamer or is it,

683
00:46:25.861 --> 00:46:28.870
is it becoming a dad that just makes you a lay person?

684
00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:31.820
Maybe it's just when you stop chasing pus,
I think so

685
00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:36.240
<v 0>your energy needs to go somewhere else.
Yeah.
And some dudes like,
you know,</v>

686
00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:40.350
like maybe it coincides with testosterone dropping.

687
00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:44.610
So it's like that's what it is.
Should be like,
what am I going to put my,

688
00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:46.740
my dream,
you know,
my tribe

689
00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:48.020
<v 2>being a boner at a time.</v>

690
00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:54.140
<v 0>See that goes away.
Right.
And then you go,
I need something else to do.</v>

691
00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:55.570
Right.
You know

692
00:46:56.460 --> 00:47:01.460
<v 2>it's glass and you get all stoked about stuff like that.
Stan Umma building.</v>

693
00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:06.250
I'll do other things.
It's like how women shut it down after they have kids too.

694
00:47:06.251 --> 00:47:09.960
They,
they stopped being a lady and the um,

695
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:14.980
get their hair cut real bad.
Yup.
And they shut down the vagina to shut it down,

696
00:47:14.981 --> 00:47:17.710
man.
You got to shut it down because you stopped.
You stopped being sexual.

697
00:47:17.711 --> 00:47:20.830
It's the same thing with women.
Yeah.
You gotta fight.

698
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:25.660
You gotta fight the fight man to stay as sexual being after you have kids.

699
00:47:25.661 --> 00:47:30.460
Where is,
what was that what,
what episode was when?
I don't remember.

700
00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:35.020
<v 0>I don't remember because that was excellent,
man.
That was so good.</v>

701
00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:37.600
Is it in here?
Um,

702
00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:42.160
maybe it's so funny man.
Uh,
here's,

703
00:47:42.161 --> 00:47:47.080
I'm a bike.
I remember that.
I'm a bike or that lady.
No,
you don't remember that.

704
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:52.600
She sat on the front of a bus,
a city us and she goes,

705
00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:56.990
I'm a bike.
Yeah.
And she made them try to get them to take her because I,

706
00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.510
this is for bikes and she goes,
I am a bike,
um,

707
00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:05.680
yelling at the thing.
I don't know where it is.
It's okay.

708
00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:10.600
It's not okay.
We can move on.
I don't want to.
Okay.
You rather have dead air.

709
00:48:10.770 --> 00:48:13.880
It's not better.
They're not dead air.
Okay,

710
00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:17.840
<v 2>well I'll fill the air while you look for something.
I,
um,</v>

711
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:23.600
I was very upset on this tour that I went on the main mother goddess tour

712
00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:26.240
because all the toilets that I took shits in.

713
00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:31.260
We're regular toilets and I felt what it was like to have life before the total

714
00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:38.090
washlet.
Yeah.
And we've had the washlet in our lives since March,

715
00:48:38.091 --> 00:48:39.590
since we moved into this rental home.

716
00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:44.510
And it really has changed me into a civilized human being.

717
00:48:44.511 --> 00:48:49.410
I no longer shit to shower because I no longer have to with a toto washlet.
Uh,

718
00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:53.720
but I found myself going back to my old ways on the road.
Tom.

719
00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:55.730
How so?
Well,

720
00:48:55.731 --> 00:48:59.900
I would take a dump in the hotel and I would wipe and wipe and wipe and the

721
00:48:59.901 --> 00:49:01.310
wives just kept on coming.

722
00:49:01.311 --> 00:49:05.530
So I had to go straight to shower and now,
now,

723
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:09.110
well now I'm back home.
But it was really gross.
It just felt gross,

724
00:49:09.111 --> 00:49:12.980
like mashing all that shit into my butthole all the time.

725
00:49:12.981 --> 00:49:17.240
That's what normal people do that don't have wash let's,
yeah.
So disgusting.

726
00:49:17.241 --> 00:49:20.360
And with you and your hair,
that must be even gross or when you're on the road.

727
00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:22.850
<v 0>I have a,
I got it.</v>

728
00:49:22.851 --> 00:49:27.851
As soon as I got to New York this week I had a big old nasty travel day dump and

729
00:49:29.631 --> 00:49:33.530
it was nice because the hotel bathroom was so tight to the sink.

730
00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:37.490
So at least you could go,
I'm sorry to the sink.
Yeah.

731
00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:42.140
So like you sat next to a sink,
you could soak toilet paper,

732
00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:43.650
you know what I mean?

733
00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:46.760
<v 2>Hmm.
That's even Nastier to me.
I'd rather just get in the shower.</v>

734
00:49:46.761 --> 00:49:49.820
How has that now grosser than just getting up and going to shower.

735
00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:56.570
So you'd wet you'd whether toilet paper and then smush it and smush it and Smush

736
00:49:56.571 --> 00:49:57.404
it that way.

737
00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:01.960
<v 0>Yeah.
How many times did you have to do that?
Mm,</v>

738
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:06.130
I dunno.
I remember probably five or six.

739
00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:11.260
<v 2>See to me that's more work.
Like maybe just go and take a shower,
you know?
Yeah.</v>

740
00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:16.090
I'm on this new diet.
Um,
cause I'm,
I started seeing a fitness trainer.
Yeah.

741
00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:21.210
And I'm on what's called a primal diet and I eat a lot of oils and fats,

742
00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:25.660
good fats.
And the thing is in the morning,

743
00:50:25.661 --> 00:50:30.020
I'm sure I drink coffee with coconut oil and organic butter in it.

744
00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:35.070
It's like a shake and it's supposed to keep you full longer and it does,

745
00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:39.800
but it also makes you have to shit shit bad dude.
Oh my God.

746
00:50:39.801 --> 00:50:42.290
I drank my coffee this morning.
I was getting Ellis up,

747
00:50:42.291 --> 00:50:47.240
changing him and as I was changing his diaper,
I had the need to fill mine.

748
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:50.420
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
I did like fucking run downstairs.

749
00:50:50.421 --> 00:50:51.950
I threw him in there like just play their hand.

750
00:50:51.951 --> 00:50:53.990
Just took a really fear shit today.

751
00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:56.570
<v 0>Okay.</v>

752
00:50:56.570 --> 00:50:58.820
<v 2>How bad was it?
It was intense.</v>

753
00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:03.420
It was like so much to like so much poop comes out of you and you,

754
00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:06.610
you realize how much there is inside of you.
That's,

755
00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:11.210
I live for those shifts where you're just surprised.
I know.
Me Too.

756
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:13.430
[inaudible] when you amaze yourself,

757
00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:18.590
that's when I feel like those types of shifts are the ones that,
that um,

758
00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:23.490
that make you go,
I'm never going to not try to shut this big,
you know?

759
00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:28.580
Right.
They inspire you to do bigger,
better dumps.
Yeah,
exactly.

760
00:51:28.581 --> 00:51:29.414
Did you find the clip?

761
00:51:30.350 --> 00:51:34.600
<v 3>He sees good in me.
Then I got a bad bite.
I got a bad bite.
I got a bad,</v>

762
00:51:34.601 --> 00:51:38.580
but I got a bad back.
I got a bad bite,
man.
I've got a bad bite to the leg.

763
00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:42.850
I've got a bad bite and I got really bad body stuff.
I've got a really bad bite,

764
00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:45.950
man.
My legs are killing me.
I've got a really good,
I gotta get home.

765
00:51:45.951 --> 00:51:48.500
I got a really bad by,
oh,
I got a bad bite.

766
00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:51.780
<v 2>I love how much you,</v>

767
00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:52.710
<v 1>that's about it.</v>

768
00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:58.770
<v 2>When you got bad.
Yeah.
He doesn't do anything.
He just talks about it.
It's bad.</v>

769
00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:03.530
<v 1>Waist,
deep bat Guano kept saying it.</v>

770
00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:09.460
Got a big open wound and all this.
All this last one.
Oh,
oh,
oh,

771
00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:11.073
I'm dying.

772
00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:14.690
<v 3>There's the tail is planning something.
Yes.
Something's going on like that.</v>

773
00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:16.920
He's planning something and squeezing you very tightly.

774
00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:18.800
<v 2>It's terrifying.
It's terrifying.</v>

775
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:23.630
Dude.
Leave.

776
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:28.430
<v 0>Damn.
That was terrible.
Yeah.
All right.
I couldn't leave it alone.</v>

777
00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:33.800
Sorry.
Hmm.
Maybe happy.
I'm a psycho member.
Yeah.

778
00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:38.480
Can't believe you that you say that so offensive to me.

779
00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:42.200
Seriously.
How could you think that?

780
00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:45.913
How can you think of that?

781
00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:49.330
<v 2>Cause I live with you.
I know you.
I've known you for years.
So full of Shit.</v>

782
00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:51.580
I've known you for years.
What does that mean?

783
00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:54.250
I think bill's point was that it's secretly lurking.

784
00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:58.990
Like one thing could set you off.
I see that happening like over the years.

785
00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:03.130
Um,
maybe like the thing will set you off and then who knows?

786
00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:05.320
That's why I think hunting might be good for you.

787
00:53:05.321 --> 00:53:10.060
It's like a release valve for all that rage,
secret rage inside of you.

788
00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:12.870
They would rather,
you know,
heard a person than an animal though.

789
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:14.620
That's what I'm saying Mary Go.

790
00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:18.370
But maybe we can channel that person hating into the animals.

791
00:53:18.371 --> 00:53:22.360
You know when they make it like a healthier aggression thing.

792
00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:28.500
I really liked that you,
you did speak in a dad.
Boners and Garth.
We uh,

793
00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:31.640
we have an older,
I would have,
FIFA is tweaked

794
00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:39.210
twitched
older.
Garth interview.
Oh,
I love Garth.

795
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:41.130
Like the origins of Dad boner.
Okay.

796
00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:44.470
<v 8>If me,
I got to pull every trick.</v>

797
00:53:44.471 --> 00:53:49.270
I know a lot of the hat because I want these people to crawl out of this place.

798
00:53:49.271 --> 00:53:52.870
I want her to be exhausted and I want them to feel what I'm feeling.

799
00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:56.860
I haven't found a better word for it,

800
00:53:56.861 --> 00:53:59.840
so please excuse me for what I'm about to say.
Sex

801
00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:04.060
<v 2>now you go,
okay.
Listen to how he describes it.</v>

802
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:10.530
<v 8>He's a real,
so is just a thousand miles an hour.</v>

803
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:15.630
It's the wildest thing.
And then in the flip of a heart,

804
00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:21.590
it goes to this nice Tinder soft thing and he find everybody leaning in and all

805
00:54:23.521 --> 00:54:24.354
of a sudden it's just

806
00:54:26.770 --> 00:54:31.720
<v 2>Garth sex for you,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Just like he knows how to put out though,</v>

807
00:54:31.721 --> 00:54:35.230
right?
I don't know.
I Dunno.
I think Garth really,

808
00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:39.660
really consumes you and you're his sexual partner.
He's annoying.
Yeah,

809
00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:45.040
he's,
he's the guy that's going to light the hundred candles and the bath.

810
00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:49.950
He's going to make intense eye contact.
Lots of,
lots of eye contact.

811
00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:52.940
Shows you the tone a lot before.

812
00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:57.160
I do like that throw up.

813
00:54:57.750 --> 00:55:01.590
<v 8>I wish there was some way,
some way you could step inside.
Nothing.</v>

814
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:05.130
See what it is.
You see.
Oh my God.

815
00:55:05.131 --> 00:55:09.930
There are times actually when I swear to God to you that you could just fly.

816
00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:10.921
It's so cool.

817
00:55:10.921 --> 00:55:15.750
It's all the things that you've always wanted to cut loose and let loose and

818
00:55:15.751 --> 00:55:19.510
just fly that you never thought you could do,
but it actually happens.

819
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:24.140
<v 2>Oh Man.
So He's been this boner for a long time.
This is a old interview.</v>

820
00:55:24.590 --> 00:55:28.730
This has gotta be 20 years old.
He really believes his own bullshit.

821
00:55:29.810 --> 00:55:32.830
He drinks his own Koolaid.
Oh yeah.
It's like,
it's like fine.

822
00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:37.560
Can I tell you I don't buy it.
I don't buy it.
I just think that he's,
I think,

823
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:41.040
I think he's a little contrived and uh,
I,

824
00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:44.870
I feel like he's a bit of a sociopath.
I don't buy it.

825
00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:50.180
It's so cool.
So cool.
I don't buy it.

826
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:54.500
He's a weird something.
Something's going on there.
I do.

827
00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:57.350
I think something's dealing.
I mean,
look,
the guy's talented.

828
00:55:57.650 --> 00:56:02.450
I'm not saying that he's not a talented person,
but I don't believe this nonsense

829
00:56:03.350 --> 00:56:06.100
<v 8>sex.
It's a elder.</v>

830
00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:11.470
<v 2>Yeah,
it's pretty cool.</v>

831
00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:13.970
<v 8>I can see why you,
I can just say</v>

832
00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:19.010
it is wonderful.
It's very addictive too.

833
00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:21.010
<v 2>Okay.
Would you rather,</v>

834
00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:27.240
would you have sex with Garth Brooks or the Vegan Vagina guy?

835
00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:34.760
Oh,
100% Garth Brooks.
I am close.
Why?

836
00:56:34.761 --> 00:56:38.540
Dude is bearable.
[inaudible] Vagina Guy.
Oh my.

837
00:56:38.541 --> 00:56:43.210
And he's disgusting.
Disgusting.
John Suck.

838
00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:47.990
Or this guy's full of himself.
He's a megalomaniac superstar.
Yeah.

839
00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.700
But that dude is gross.

840
00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:54.870
He's gross and full of himself,
you know,

841
00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:57.040
and he's missing teeth.
Oh,

842
00:56:57.260 --> 00:57:01.820
Garth has at least you're going to have a nice situation to do it in a nice

843
00:57:01.821 --> 00:57:06.320
situation.
Yeah.
He has a nice house and know we forgot what our perfect smiles.

844
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:10.190
I know they're in the next room.
You vamped for a minute.
I'll go grab them.

845
00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:14.810
While we wore those perfect smiles on Instagram and people really enjoyed them.

846
00:57:15.050 --> 00:57:18.490
Yeah.
Um,
yeah.
Bad,
right?

847
00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:22.960
<v 0>I Dunno.
I have no idea where they are.
I have no idea.</v>

848
00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:27.730
None where the perfect smiles are.
Please don't ask me.

849
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:32.500
But um,
you know,
that's an unpaid sponsorship.

850
00:57:32.830 --> 00:57:36.460
Nobody asked us to promote the perfect smile.

851
00:57:36.550 --> 00:57:40.180
Nobody paid us to promote the perfect smile.

852
00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:45.450
We just got perfect smiles on our own and we wore them and we showed them to

853
00:57:45.731 --> 00:57:50.290
everybody on Instagram and I don't think it could be any better,
man.

854
00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:51.940
I felt so much more confident.

855
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:56.440
I feel like I'm going to get that date.
I'm going to go,

856
00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:58.600
I'm going to go get that interview.

857
00:57:58.601 --> 00:58:01.630
I'm going to get that job now that my teeth are perfect.

858
00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:06.180
So we have perfect smiles now.

859
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:16.650
<v 2>Oh,
nice.
Dead Air.
You only thing about dead air.
That's the ultimate death move.</v>

860
00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:20.760
What you put these in and just look at the camera just for you to know.
I know,

861
00:58:20.761 --> 00:58:25.240
but I'm saying we're both to talk.
That was point.
I told you the damn.
All right.

862
00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:26.160
I did talk.

863
00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:31.240
I'm talking about are you gave me the perfect smile and I'll put it in and I

864
00:58:31.590 --> 00:58:35.010
just told them how much more confident I felt she was getting it.
Total smile.

865
00:58:35.011 --> 00:58:38.160
Confidence.
These are the worst things.

866
00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.620
I've seen better teeth at the Halloween store.

867
00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:44.430
They kind of looked like Halloween teeth.
They look white,
worser than him.

868
00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:47.310
Then I kind of showed you how to,
how to put them in for pictures,

869
00:58:47.311 --> 00:58:50.390
so the problem is is I was actually trying to put them in like they were of

870
00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:53.910
veneers,
but you put them in your lips and then they'll actually,

871
00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:55.860
you actually look like you have old,

872
00:58:56.790 --> 00:59:00.300
old eastern bloc teeth when you wear them like that.
Yeah.

873
00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:03.300
Right now they just look like,
oh wow.
She had her,

874
00:59:03.330 --> 00:59:07.380
she had her teeth fixed and the early seventies in the Ukraine or something.

875
00:59:07.381 --> 00:59:11.930
Right.
That's what it looks like in Hungary.
Mine look like dog teeth.
I'm clear.

876
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:15.150
It sounds it.
Smile and venture commercials.

877
00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:22.590
The perfect map.
Now here's crazy part with the perfect

878
00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:29.320
and you is that these are shaped almost exactly like your real teeth.

879
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:32.540
The gums are too bloody and red,

880
00:59:32.541 --> 00:59:35.930
but the shape of them is identical to what you got

881
00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:40.610
<v 0>date with somebody though.
And they had these in be able to tell.
You'd be like,</v>

882
00:59:40.611 --> 00:59:44.960
what is up with her teeth?
Her no horse right away.

883
00:59:46.890 --> 00:59:47.723
<v 9>Okay.</v>

884
00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:50.250
<v 0>Cause they wouldn't be in their lips.
They would be in their mouth.</v>

885
00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:52.073
You know what I mean?

886
01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:02.680
People wear them.
Who have,
um,

887
01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:06.790
the problem with this also is it sits on your other teeth.
So somebody who has,

888
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:10.570
let's say two bad teeth here,
right?
You put this in,

889
01:00:10.571 --> 01:00:12.130
it's still sitting over your other,

890
01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:16.750
<v 2>yeah,
it's too chunky.
Yeah.
The,
the design flaw.
There's a few design flaws.</v>

891
01:00:16.751 --> 01:00:18.730
Number one,
these are for women.

892
01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:22.120
So men and women have different shapes.

893
01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:27.190
Teeth and these are too small for most men.
And the gums were bloody.

894
01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:31.720
And that's too thick and chunky.
Yeah.
If you were to melt,
first of all,

895
01:00:31.721 --> 01:00:35.390
I would not trust this shit.
Sticking it to your teeth.
Oh fuck.

896
01:00:35.391 --> 01:00:38.140
Now to melt this plastic and they don't melt it to you.

897
01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:42.850
You're supposed to put it in hot water and it loosens the glue and then you pop

898
01:00:42.851 --> 01:00:45.510
on and then they adhere to your real team,

899
01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:48.780
which helps even more confident now.
It should.

900
01:00:48.790 --> 01:00:52.330
Perfect smile cabinet todo smell.

901
01:00:52.331 --> 01:00:54.630
Confidence tonal.
Ma'Am.

902
01:00:57.370 --> 01:01:02.110
<v 0>Um,
you know that this Guy John wrote to us?
Yes.</v>

903
01:01:02.111 --> 01:01:05.380
I met him.
Reviewed his denim.
Oh,
you did?
I did.
I met him in person.

904
01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:11.520
Came to one of the shows in a Texas,
I believe.
Hmm.
Um,
did,

905
01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:15.520
did his denim come up there?
Yeah,
he goes,
I'm the one that sent you the picture.

906
01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:18.490
We've had multiple pictures sent in though though.

907
01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:22.740
There's this guy in particular.
Yeah.
And then he,
uh,
he got 'em.

908
01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:27.130
He got 'em my tailor better.
Yeah,
much better.
That's all we're talking about.

909
01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:32.080
Good job.
Much better.
Yeah.
It just looks better.
It looks so much better.
Good job.

910
01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:35.950
You know how to wear your jeans now.
Total gene confidence.
Yeah.

911
01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:41.260
Total genes.
Confidence.
A Nice job,
sir.
John,

912
01:01:41.350 --> 01:01:46.150
is it good job.
We allow you to wear your genius for you.

913
01:01:46.151 --> 01:01:48.310
Good for you.
Hey,

914
01:01:48.370 --> 01:01:53.370
did you wonder about making dog food since you ate some a while ago?

915
01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:58.550
<v 10>I'm Lisa had to see,
I'm the founder of your pet shop and he may,</v>

916
01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:01.850
looks like ally's dog food and treats here in Chicago.

917
01:02:03.850 --> 01:02:07.070
We use all human grade ingredients.
Oh,

918
01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:12.140
that we puree up into bars.
This looks really cool.
Cards.

919
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:15.550
<v 0>Yeah,
into burrs.
You read that</v>

920
01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:20.010
<v 10>whole foods or a more natural diet.
Wild Diet.</v>

921
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:24.980
It really helps them have a longer,
better quality of life.
Wow.
Y'All,

922
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:29.310
before dogs were domesticated,
they ate what they killed and they ate withdraw.

923
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.710
So we prepared food raw.
We do like baking or freeze dried.

924
01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:38.070
So we really take a lot of those history lessons and include them.

925
01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:41.390
<v 2>I kind of want to get some of her dog treats.
Hi.
Yeah.</v>

926
01:02:41.391 --> 01:02:45.230
I kinda feel like there's something I need to ask for so that I can eat these

927
01:02:45.231 --> 01:02:47.940
treats.
You know what I mean?
I wasn't thinking like that.
Like we should buy them.

928
01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:48.591
No,

929
01:02:48.591 --> 01:02:53.591
I'm thinking that I've been eyeballing this necklace that I wanted to get and I

930
01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:58.310
to eat some of these traits.
If you'd buy me that necklace,
by the way,

931
01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:02.570
when I was on the road,
you want this food.
When I of course when I was in a,

932
01:03:02.571 --> 01:03:05.300
I think it was Cincy this girl goes,
hey,

933
01:03:05.301 --> 01:03:08.890
is that the ring you got for eating dog food?
And I go,
yeah,
actually

934
01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:13.190
she noticed from the stage the stage.

935
01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:17.330
So there's a necklace I want that matches this ring.

936
01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:21.830
I would totally eat this dog food if you'd get me the necklace.

937
01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:24.500
But it seems like you really are enjoying dog food.

938
01:03:25.850 --> 01:03:28.170
Bring that up as well.

939
01:03:28.210 --> 01:03:31.670
I don't then it doesn't have to be dog food is or something else you want me to

940
01:03:31.671 --> 01:03:32.370
do.

941
01:03:32.370 --> 01:03:34.450
<v 10>Uh,
Louis loosely,
godless treats for breathing.</v>

942
01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:39.730
I just kept feeding her and feeding her.
So we put her on the Lucy Diet.
She got,

943
01:03:39.731 --> 01:03:41.200
you know,
a little more Pumpkin,

944
01:03:41.201 --> 01:03:43.720
a little more green means a little more whole foods.

945
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:48.670
And she was able to lose 22 pounds,
six months.

946
01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:52.030
And that was a pivotal point for me in creating your pet shop.

947
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:56.660
<v 2>Aw,
I looks delicious.
Sounds pretty cool.
No maggots though.</v>

948
01:03:56.661 --> 01:03:59.900
I'd like my maggots.
How about this?
This came up.

949
01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:05.160
<v 11>So they have this menu for my dog,
right?
Chip,
lefties,
food.
Can you imagine</v>

950
01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:08.760
<v 2>Serina Williams,
the greatest female tennis player of all time?</v>

951
01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:12.090
<v 11>Yeah,
chip is three years old and he's been traveling for three years.</v>

952
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:15.510
The little guy leaves his food at home.
He doesn't pack food.

953
01:04:16.050 --> 01:04:18.300
So this hotel in the Dusky menu

954
01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:23.370
<v 2>chips not supposed to pack his own food.
You are.
That's very true.</v>

955
01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:27.510
But look at that menu.
That's a doggy man.
Yeah,
I've seen that before.

956
01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:33.190
<v 11>Third and yeah,
certain hotels.
I was like,
that looks so good.</v>

957
01:04:33.191 --> 01:04:34.600
It was like fresh,

958
01:04:34.601 --> 01:04:38.650
like Greens and boil chicken and beef.

959
01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:39.670
And it was seared.

960
01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:44.620
It was seared like tenderly and it was just perfection.
And I was like,

961
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:49.300
fat looks like the best food looks better than my food.
Right?

962
01:04:50.310 --> 01:04:53.120
So
I might want to taste it.
Suits.

963
01:04:53.121 --> 01:04:57.040
So I ordered him the salmon and rice because I thought I ate salmon.

964
01:04:58.030 --> 01:05:03.000
So I ordered a seven rice before you judge me and look at it.
Look,

965
01:05:03.010 --> 01:05:07.000
that's the Santa and right,
let's kind of all mixed together,
right?
Yeah.

966
01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:10.810
I'm like,
what the heck?
I'm going to try a piece.
It looks good.

967
01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:15.430
So I eat a spoonful.
Don't judge me.
I ate a spoonful.

968
01:05:15.550 --> 01:05:19.450
Don't judge me.
Let's fast forward to two hours.

969
01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.700
I just went into the toilet like,

970
01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:27.130
like I thought I was gonna pass out.
Really?
I mean it,
it did taste weird.

971
01:05:27.131 --> 01:05:29.980
Like I've forced,
I forced swallowed it like

972
01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:34.450
<v 2>whoa.
That was like,
well you did.
Yeah,
but I,</v>

973
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:37.310
I don't know if this sounds like it affected her dumps.
I did.

974
01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:39.940
You didn't say it smelled like dog food.
Remember?

975
01:05:39.941 --> 01:05:43.360
It didn't smell like dog should,
I mean,
yeah.
That's interesting.
So,

976
01:05:43.450 --> 01:05:47.020
but we learned about the w the reason why it's their anal glands that make the

977
01:05:47.021 --> 01:05:51.690
dog smell like dogs.
She would have been like,
Yo,
it didn't smell like dog stuff.

978
01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:52.563
Like my shot,

979
01:05:53.710 --> 01:05:56.750
<v 11>like it tastes a little bit like a house cleaner kind of thing.</v>

980
01:05:56.751 --> 01:06:01.310
I don't know what his name is,
dog food.
But chip liked it.
And it looked good,

981
01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:04.550
but I don't think it's consumable.

982
01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:08.320
Consumable for you minutes.

983
01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:11.180
Um,
they should have

984
01:06:12.250 --> 01:06:14.590
<v 2>the only thing that would have this better would it be at the end of,</v>

985
01:06:14.591 --> 01:06:17.020
she was like,
Thompson,
girl,
you gotta buy me some jewelry.

986
01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:21.980
I bought this ring.
I ate that.

987
01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:28.120
<v 11>Then today I paid 15 year olds for that stuff that's making me go to the</v>

988
01:06:28.121 --> 01:06:32.710
bathroom.
I mean,
doing number two is I need a life.
She was right.

989
01:06:33.550 --> 01:06:35.060
You need to get you,
I really do need to get

990
01:06:35.290 --> 01:06:40.000
<v 2>life.
Oh my God.
She is listening to our show.</v>

991
01:06:40.690 --> 01:06:45.480
You know the dog food,
they get y'all out.
I didn't get sick when I ate,
um,

992
01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:50.550
fiefs food.
Uh,
but they must have given them,

993
01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:52.920
I mean,
dog stomachs are way stronger than ours.

994
01:06:53.790 --> 01:06:55.500
She said it tasted like cleaning agent.

995
01:06:55.501 --> 01:06:58.680
Maybe it was like just like out of the dumpster,
you know,

996
01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:02.070
and she had one bite and it made her shit.
Like that's crazy.
Then again,

997
01:07:02.071 --> 01:07:07.071
her system might be so strictly queen because she's a pro athlete that just like

998
01:07:08.251 --> 01:07:10.590
me,
Bam.
Just like me.
You like any,

999
01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:14.970
any little variation maybe makes Brown happen,

1000
01:07:17.070 --> 01:07:19.570
I guess.
Yeah,
that's really weird though.
That's a,

1001
01:07:19.571 --> 01:07:23.340
that's a lot of fancy shift for dogs to Nice,
nice joint.

1002
01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:27.750
Do or she staying?
Well you mean those are the prices for dogs.

1003
01:07:27.751 --> 01:07:32.340
I can imagine what the people as well for a plate of shitty dog,

1004
01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:36.450
it's like close to 30 bucks.
That's glory.
It almost two to one.

1005
01:07:36.451 --> 01:07:40.980
What is the euro dollar?
Like a dollar and a half.
It was last time we went there,

1006
01:07:40.981 --> 01:07:43.740
but I'm sure it's worse.
Way Worse for now.

1007
01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:49.820
Breck
it's closer now to what?

1008
01:07:49.890 --> 01:07:54.420
One to one.
So 15 bucks is $16 oh wow.

1009
01:07:54.421 --> 01:07:57.050
Much closer.
So weaker euro.
Debbie,

1010
01:07:57.051 --> 01:08:02.051
since Brexit,

1011
01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:08.200
Ace Brits.
If you're not from hair,
get out.

1012
01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:17.090
Africans do a job's and the polar works.

1013
01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:19.610
There's so many.
Polacks last time we went,

1014
01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:25.120
the whole labor force was Polish people and when I lived there in the late

1015
01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:29.550
nineties it wasn't like that for sure.
It looks like 2014

1016
01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:35.430
<v 0>mid 2014 was the height of the value really?
What was it?</v>

1017
01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:37.740
Uh,
it just shows it's just a chart.

1018
01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:42.600
It was up to 1.4 times.
What are you eating?
Stupid.

1019
01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:47.700
Just over 1.4,
okay.
Almost one and a half times.

1020
01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:53.090
And then 2015 saw the biggest dip to almost equal or which is basically where

1021
01:08:55.711 --> 01:09:00.270
it's at now.
It's almost equal.
It's time to go to England,
man.
Yeah.
Well,

1022
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.580
well no,
because they're out of the euro market now.

1023
01:09:02.670 --> 01:09:07.000
<v 2>Uh,
the outro,
let's see,
let's see what dollar depends on</v>

1024
01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:12.650
dude,
dude,
dude,
British pound.
Oh,

1025
01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:15.340
the pound is weaker than the dollar.
You're right.
So

1026
01:09:17.670 --> 01:09:21.270
the British pay on it.
When we went,
it was definitely stronger.

1027
01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:22.410
It was kicking our ass.

1028
01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:25.230
And when I was there in the nineties it was kicking our ass too.

1029
01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:29.580
<v 0>Yeah.
Hmm.
Nope.
Brexit is doing thanks.</v>

1030
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.200
Wow.
Interesting.
Oof.

1031
01:09:36.610 --> 01:09:39.000
That's rough.
Rough seas over there right now.
No.
Yeah,

1032
01:09:39.001 --> 01:09:41.260
it is a good time for a trip there.
I know

1033
01:09:41.730 --> 01:09:46.600
<v 2>my,
we have this kid leave them or just fly for like 10 hours.</v>

1034
01:09:46.930 --> 01:09:51.120
Kids love being on planes.
Small babies.
They love it.
Yeah.

1035
01:09:51.350 --> 01:09:55.300
So horrible.
We could do that.
You want to take him?

1036
01:09:55.330 --> 01:09:59.050
I would do it and then fuck up his sleeve schedule.
Oh my God.
Could you imagine?

1037
01:09:59.190 --> 01:10:03.990
<v 0>I would do it.
Um,
next summer,
like he's old.
He's older.
Yeah.</v>

1038
01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.540
I think year and a half you could still get him to sit in your lap.

1039
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:11.460
<v 2>I think he needs his own.
Even at this stage,
his own dude,</v>

1040
01:10:11.461 --> 01:10:14.490
he's all over the place.
I took him to the eye doctor today.

1041
01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:18.390
Like he'll sit on your lap for like 10 minutes and then he's like,
well,

1042
01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:21.270
he just wants to crawl around and investigate.
Yeah.

1043
01:10:21.330 --> 01:10:23.730
He doesn't want any kind of lab business for that long.

1044
01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:28.530
No lap business too adventurous dude.
Yeah.
No,
he ain't doing it.

1045
01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:30.750
Yeah.
But at this age it would suck to travel with them.

1046
01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:32.310
Even though I met that guy who's like,
oh yeah,

1047
01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:36.130
we went to Paris with our five month old.
I was like,
what?
Yeah.

1048
01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.640
You went to Paris with him.
You know,

1049
01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:42.350
I guess those people have a much stronger constitution than you and I,
because I,

1050
01:10:42.351 --> 01:10:45.780
yeah.
The,
the thought of it is a,
it sounds like a nightmare to me.

1051
01:10:46.230 --> 01:10:49.140
I think those people just were not built for that.
We're not,
we're not.

1052
01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:50.910
I think you can just be like,
yeah,

1053
01:10:50.911 --> 01:10:52.560
it's going to suck and I'm going to do it anyway.

1054
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.770
<v 0>People that need like a perfect smile,
but not to be like,</v>

1055
01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:01.010
you know,
stressed out on a plane.

1056
01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:08.730
<v 2>You cannot eat with that on your date.
There's no way you can,
I didn't eat,</v>

1057
01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:11.010
I went on a date with this by the way.
The date went great.

1058
01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:15.150
I think she really liked me and I just didn't eat,
you know,
and she was like,

1059
01:11:15.151 --> 01:11:18.080
aren't you going to order something?
And I was like,
all right.

1060
01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:23.100
I had a late lunch.
I had a light lunch.
Phil,
I've,

1061
01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.200
I don't have much of an appetite.

1062
01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:29.190
I got the job with my perfect smile and she goes,
what about she goes,

1063
01:11:29.191 --> 01:11:30.540
can I get a kiss goodnight and go,

1064
01:11:31.050 --> 01:11:36.050
I'm not wanting to rush to do that for a movie on a second date and I'll take it

1065
01:11:37.291 --> 01:11:41.930
out.
I carried her casket night.
I got the job with my perfect.
You got to,

1066
01:11:42.010 --> 01:11:45.830
you got the job.
How was the interview
please?

1067
01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:50.760
That's good.
Not that aware of the rubric.
Yeah,

1068
01:11:54.570 --> 01:11:58.020
you look like somebody I would hire.
As soon as I saw that,
I was like,
Scott,

1069
01:11:58.070 --> 01:12:02.310
a nice smile I think are going to hire for this.
Perfect.

1070
01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:06.180
Perfect.
That girl's got a perfect smile.

1071
01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:10.740
Who Do you want it to work?
Who Do you want representing your company?
This guy,

1072
01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:14.233
wait,

1073
01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:23.630
is that the whites of your eyes match the whiteness of those teeth,

1074
01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:26.750
but it makes you look dead.
Kind of like the dentist.

1075
01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:30.980
What's his name that runs the the the bunny ranch.
Dennis Hoff.

1076
01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:33.830
That's what happens when your teeth are like fake,
fake,

1077
01:12:33.831 --> 01:12:36.530
fake looking white and then they match the whites of your eyes.

1078
01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:40.720
It makes you look like the crypt keeper.
You look dead.
He looks,

1079
01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:43.960
he looks terrible.
And then you posted,

1080
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:47.650
did you post a picture of the that team owner that you liked with the haircut

1081
01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:49.293
look like that

1082
01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:56.460
areas that dirty pants.
It's such a scum.
Fuck.

1083
01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:00.300
Those teeth are too white now and it looks terrible.

1084
01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:04.380
He looks dead till.
Yeah.
Yeah man.

1085
01:13:05.950 --> 01:13:10.770
I'm like good old ass pimp.
Yeah,
he's a gross.
So gross.

1086
01:13:10.771 --> 01:13:14.880
Look how he's holding that chick's snack.
Yeah.
It's weird.
Creeper.

1087
01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:18.080
He was creepy on that show and he was,
yeah,

1088
01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:24.780
I got my perfect smile.
We were so excited when this showed up.
The perfect smile.

1089
01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:29.840
It's the only 1599 and then 1599 for shipping and handling such scumbags.

1090
01:13:30.270 --> 01:13:32.910
Yeah.
Cause if you're broken enough that you need the perfect smile,

1091
01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:37.240
you can't afford $15 in shipping.
I think this is back when he had his teeth.

1092
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:40.680
See if it looks better.
It's so much better.
So much better.

1093
01:13:40.681 --> 01:13:44.840
Cause then that matches the oldness of state.
Yeah,

1094
01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:48.830
I'll look jaggedy it's fine.
Yeah.
Oh,

1095
01:13:48.831 --> 01:13:52.910
you're talking about Davis.
Mark Davis.
Yeah.
That guy looks good too.

1096
01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:56.120
Let's see if he's smiling.
Oof.

1097
01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:05.310
So crazy.
Yeah.
Oh well.

1098
01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:07.970
Oh here he is.
Kind of,
but like I said,

1099
01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:14.730
remember how it said he drives 500 miles to get this haircut.
Yeah,
it does.

1100
01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:17.350
Yeah.
Those teeth aren't good.
Yeah.

1101
01:14:17.410 --> 01:14:21.010
Those are weird teeth and he's now a lot of money.
He should afford better tea.

1102
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:22.930
Oh my God.
500 million.

1103
01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:26.230
He's got $500 million.

1104
01:14:26.231 --> 01:14:30.560
Just spend a few of those dollars on teeth,
bro.
And a haircut.
Cool hair,

1105
01:14:30.561 --> 01:14:31.560
Yannick cool haircut.

1106
01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:34.220
<v 0>Somebody said,
I think I said it back then,
that if,
uh,</v>

1107
01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:37.880
he's the Kinda guy that if people stop talking about his haircut,

1108
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:38.743
he would change it.

1109
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:42.070
<v 2>Oh right.
People are like,
that guys cut your hair.
He's like,

Well,

1112
01:14:47.681 --> 01:14:50.560
that didn't think you're maybe hurting yourself on that one though.
Yeah.

1113
01:14:51.010 --> 01:14:54.130
That and it makes you more interesting.
That's your,
your hook.

1114
01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:56.650
It's like the guy that has the exotic pet.

1115
01:14:56.770 --> 01:14:58.960
Who's that guy looks like he's retarded because of the haircut.

1116
01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:02.950
He's an interesting guy.
His name is mark.
Right.
We'll talk to them.
Right.

1117
01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:06.820
It's like the guy that walks down Venice beach with a snake around his nae.
Yeah.

1118
01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:10.300
Any,
any does it cause people go pair it?
Yeah.

1119
01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:14.560
Well it's just my thing.
I got a lizard on a,
yeah,
I keep it around my neck.

1120
01:15:14.770 --> 01:15:17.960
You can pet it.
It's cool.
Yeah.
I'm gonna feed them fucking rats everyday.
Yeah.

1121
01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:21.760
South beach too.
There's a lot of that.
I got an Iguana,

1122
01:15:21.790 --> 01:15:26.530
petty Guana around my neck.
Seems unusual.
Whoa.
I'm kind of an unusual guy.

1123
01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:31.240
I'm kind of weird like that.
Okay.
Just a little misdirected energy.
Little bit,

1124
01:15:31.330 --> 01:15:32.163
a little,

1125
01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:36.150
<v 0>little bit.
Um,
let's see somebody,</v>

1126
01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:39.180
there's some emails here,
which,

1127
01:15:39.181 --> 01:15:43.110
why am h song should these mommy's train their kid to someone said,

1128
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:45.750
I'm about to become a mommy myself.

1129
01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:51.200
Our Carl's Jr is due March 2nd that's not right around the corner.

1130
01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:53.003
Um,

1131
01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:59.060
my friend recently recommended to me to begin a song to sing a song every day to

1132
01:16:00.611 --> 01:16:04.460
baby jeans and then when baby jeans is born it will recognize the song,

1133
01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:07.920
go to sleep.
She said it worked for her.
So why not give it a try?

1134
01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:11.580
My husband and I have been trying to figure out which your mom's house song

1135
01:16:11.581 --> 01:16:13.050
would best suit this instance.

1136
01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:15.540
We were hoping to have some insight from the main mommies.

1137
01:16:16.050 --> 01:16:17.940
Husband is leaning towards red,
red wine.

1138
01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:21.750
<v 2>I tend to lean towards Miami fart machine to worry.</v>

1139
01:16:21.751 --> 01:16:26.400
It might be too energetic for Carl's junior.
Go to sleep to thoughts,

1140
01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:31.200
suggestions.
Thank you Katie and Ryan.
Like a lullaby.
Yeah.

1141
01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:34.980
Well something that,
you know,

1142
01:16:35.670 --> 01:16:39.600
I mean Conga,

Congo,
but she's right.
That's pretty high energy.

1143
01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:42.750
You're going to sleep.
Come on.
I agree.

1144
01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:46.860
I liked Theo's jam.

1145
01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:52.220

1146
01:16:53.730 --> 01:16:57.690
That's a good one.
Or um,

my fucking cat.
My cat.

1147
01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:01.610
My cat might be a lot for a little.
You don't think it's a lot for a child?

1148
01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:04.253
No.

1149
01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:08.870
<v 0>Seems really aggressive for a,

1150
01:17:09.170 --> 01:17:10.100
I think.
Yeah.

um,
whatever.
I can't think of the name of this.

1164
01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:12.370
I know what I'm talking about it or no,
I do,

1165
01:18:12.371 --> 01:18:16.600
but I don't know the titles to any Marvin Gaye Song.

I think my clients a really,

Great.

1168
01:18:24.851 --> 01:18:28.900
Cause it's a positive message for a child to establish healthy boundaries.

1169
01:18:29.410 --> 01:18:31.990
When I get the right one.
Yeah.
Oh that's right.
It's a,

it's a good song to teach somebody boundaries.
Hell No.

1192
01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:39.860
I don't know if it's a bit much for going to sleep.

1193
01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:47.290
A little subdued.

01:24:40.750 --> 01:24:42.110
Take his pussy.

1229
01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:49.600
Also make some art.

1230
01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:53.170
I can say whatever I fucking want.

1231
01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:08.020
It's gross.
I don't want to wear diapers.
My Brown say hello.

1232
01:25:08.490 --> 01:25:09.100
I'm Sam.

1233
01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:14.100
My fucking head control of my own garage and a woman's arm refer to me as

1234
01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:18.970
Excentra.
Man.
What a Dick.

1235
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:23.140
What the fuck is the matter with you,
dude?
Like I give a fucking shit.

1236
01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:28.270
I love being a racist redneck.
Intellectuals.
Get the fuck Outta here.

1237
01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:31.740
I don't really care what your opinion as Christina said.

1238
01:25:32.730 --> 01:25:37.570
Brilliant stuff,
man.
What the fuck?

1239
01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:41.580
Jesus Christ.
Sorry.
Okay.

1240
01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:49.200
Smoking crack
and

1241
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:57.590
<v 2>so good.
It's so good.
You think I give a fucking shit.</v>

1242
01:25:57.730 --> 01:26:01.690
That's Peter Stain.
That will be one man.

1243
01:26:02.190 --> 01:26:06.680
He made that one the game.
Yeah,
the cannoli did,

1244
01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:10.640
did great.
And these songs,
man,
there's so good.
Yeah.

1245
01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:14.880
Really talented people
were bored.

1246
01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:20.860
My Endo airport in the Orlando Airport near Orlando Airport.

1247
01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:26.750
Now the best,
uh,
top dog ones is the trance,
I think.
I think.

1248
01:26:28.670 --> 01:26:31.260
Yes.
Matthew Miller.
Yeah.

1249
01:26:31.850 --> 01:26:32.683
<v 9>Amazing.</v>

1250
01:26:40.610 --> 01:26:41.443
Yeah,
he's

1251
01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:47.990
out of money.
Okay.

1252
01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:57.383
Okay,

1253
01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:02.150
good.

1254
01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:05.830
<v 2>Absolutely know.
It's incredible.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

1255
01:27:06.050 --> 01:27:08.870
these dogs got to eat their dinner.
I know.
It's a little standing there.

1256
01:27:08.871 --> 01:27:13.070
Like how learn,
I'm going to let them out real quick or you are okay.
Go ahead.

1257
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:17.090
Let them out that time out.

1258
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:22.743
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1259
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:27.990
<v 0>Do,
do Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.
Let's see.
Hi,</v>

1260
01:27:28.050 --> 01:27:29.010
Mommy's.

1261
01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:30.710
<v 1>Yup.
Yup,
Yup.</v>

1262
01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:36.500
<v 0>What?
All right.
Do you like how she just,
Oh,</v>

1263
01:27:36.501 --> 01:27:41.450
by the way,
you know what I'm an Irish lady said to me,

1264
01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:42.950
<v 1>MMM</v>

1265
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:47.460
<v 0>Irish lady.
He said to me after a short one of the shows in New York,
what's that?</v>

1266
01:27:47.670 --> 01:27:49.770
She goes,
I don't mean to be two ends of a cunt,

1267
01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:51.540
but do you mind if I take a picture?

1268
01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:56.230
<v 2>Oh,
that's good.
Two ends of a,
I've never heard that.
And Pena would love that.</v>

1269
01:27:56.260 --> 01:28:01.030
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a special one.
Two ends of a cut.

1270
01:28:01.570 --> 01:28:04.090
That's funny.
Couldn't believe it.
Um,

1271
01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.750
much mummies.

1272
01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:10.590
<v 0>Whoa.
Ah,
a la</v>

1273
01:28:10.990 --> 01:28:14.130
<v 2>Sun's going down.
That means the trick or treaters are going to start coming.</v>

1274
01:28:14.131 --> 01:28:18.960
So Shit.
Yeah,
we gotta get our candies.
Readies we're um,
yeah,

1275
01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:21.960
I got good candy by the way.
I didn't get fucking bullshit.

1276
01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:24.660
I got Reesy cups and snickers.

1277
01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:29.370
Those are too high value treats.
That's true.
That's true.

1278
01:28:32.170 --> 01:28:33.910
Nothing worse than Shitty Candy.
Right?

1279
01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:39.540
<v 3>Did she,</v>

1280
01:28:45.930 --> 01:28:48.640
the urine homeless men

1281
01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:54.610
have sex with your sister.
They give a face.

1282
01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:00.790
Grandmother walks in on you masturbating.
Never have another

1283
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:06.320
trying to play this time of day.
Would you rather happen

1284
01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:11.591
<v 2>jeans?</v>

1285
01:29:11.591 --> 01:29:15.790
Would you rather lose your voice and only be able to speak through soundboard

1286
01:29:15.791 --> 01:29:17.930
drops from the podcast for a month?
Yup.

1287
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:23.010
Or have to talk like top dog for a year.
Uh,
what's wrong?

1288
01:29:23.011 --> 01:29:25.600
What's hotdogs talking?
What's the dilemma?

1289
01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:28.710
I guess if you want to have kind of like top dog for a year buddy.
Right.

1290
01:29:28.711 --> 01:29:31.810
Just sound rops but that's for a month.

1291
01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:36.280
Every communicate everything with us now it's like,
oh my fucking cat.

1292
01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:38.260
Oof.
Um,

1293
01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:42.460
I guess I do top dog just cause you can still talk like a person.

1294
01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:47.710
I mean people would be like,
why are you talking like a older white guy?
But yeah,

1295
01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:51.940
I'm almost there so I feel like it's real easy for me to really close.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1296
01:29:51.941 --> 01:29:53.890
At the top dog people keep telling me too,
they're like,
oh,

1297
01:29:53.891 --> 01:29:57.270
you sound a lot like your dad.
Yeah.
Shutting more like,
um,
so yeah,

1298
01:29:57.610 --> 01:30:00.880
becoming a dad makes you your dad.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know.

1299
01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:03.190
It's kind of depressing though,
right?
A little bit.
Yeah.

1300
01:30:03.490 --> 01:30:06.940
Once you start to process it,
you're like,
oh shit dude.
Totally.

1301
01:30:06.970 --> 01:30:10.870
You're your zoning like him a little bit to check,
check out.

1302
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:16.600
What's that?
What's that buddy?
Yeah.
Oh,
I,
yeah.
I wasn't nothing.
Yeah.
Yeah,
totally.

1303
01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:20.230
Yeah.
That one's an easy one.
Yeah.
What are you pick?
No,

1304
01:30:20.231 --> 01:30:22.720
definitely just talk like we're already like for a year,

1305
01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:27.070
a month of fucking answering questions from a sound like you imagine trying to

1306
01:30:27.071 --> 01:30:28.990
express yourself all day.

1307
01:30:28.991 --> 01:30:33.991
Like that horrible man search for the dry eye level while at there,

1308
01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:39.190
you know?
Right.
That's right.
You're just talking like that.

1309
01:30:41.770 --> 01:30:44.110
<v 15>Oh my God.</v>

1310
01:30:44.890 --> 01:30:48.430
<v 2>That's hard to talk like that
today.</v>

1311
01:30:49.210 --> 01:30:53.830
Big words.
That's a lot.
It's hard,
man.
How do you communicate?

1312
01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:58.900
You couldn't ask for anything.
No.
You'd have to build words.

1313
01:30:58.930 --> 01:31:01.420
You'd have to build new sentences with the words that you had.

1314
01:31:01.450 --> 01:31:02.290
It would take forever.

1315
01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:07.780
Would you rather have to start every conversation talking retarded or start

1316
01:31:08.171 --> 01:31:12.400
every conversation talking in a baby talk.
Ah,
that's tough.
Where you're like,

1317
01:31:12.401 --> 01:31:15.670
yeah,
get book.
Like he would talk to Betsy or Fifo

1318
01:31:17.590 --> 01:31:20.510
or talking retarded.
I don't know what that means.

1319
01:31:20.511 --> 01:31:25.330
Does that mean the toggling retired like Stevie's girlfriend?
Well,
the thing is,

1320
01:31:25.331 --> 01:31:30.280
I think people would really look at you so much crazier if you just started

1321
01:31:30.281 --> 01:31:34.380
talking retarded as opposed to baby,
they'd be like,
this is eccentric.

1322
01:31:34.570 --> 01:31:39.060
You talk retarded.
If you were like,
oh,
we want to write that,

1323
01:31:39.070 --> 01:31:43.880
people would be like,
Whoa,
whoa dude.
People just walk away from you and well,

1324
01:31:43.881 --> 01:31:46.450
what I would do is that they think you're mocking that more marketing.
Yeah.

1325
01:31:46.451 --> 01:31:49.570
I would carry a dog with me at all times.
Yeah.
You have to.

1326
01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:53.380
You could have one of them.
One free 10.
Yeah,
and then I could just be like,
hey,

1327
01:31:53.381 --> 01:31:56.920
got blue again.
I don't think I'm just talking to the dog.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1328
01:31:57.490 --> 01:32:01.480
Cause talking retarded.
That's a hard segue.
Yeah,
it is.
Sure is.

1329
01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:04.510
I mean you slept and incorporated that into your act,

1330
01:32:04.511 --> 01:32:07.420
which I feel like would increase the value retarded.

1331
01:32:07.421 --> 01:32:11.830
The biggest retarded give you want to move tickets.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Talk to your agent.

1332
01:32:12.010 --> 01:32:15.030
Just see what he thinks.
Let's see what Andrew thinks about this idea.

1333
01:32:15.031 --> 01:32:19.940
I like the idea,
Andrew thinking about doing a whole retarded act.
The,

1334
01:32:19.950 --> 01:32:23.530
see,
I can't see him not thinking it would go well.
It was,

1335
01:32:23.531 --> 01:32:26.290
I would take the baby talk by the way.
Hey Buddy.

1336
01:32:28.350 --> 01:32:32.770
Oh,
hi babies.
Hi Schnitzel.

1337
01:32:34.150 --> 01:32:38.580
I pencils.
So it's hard walking.
Hi everybody.
Hi.

1338
01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:41.820
So they would just think,
oh,
he's just like a sweet,
like a nice,

1339
01:32:42.330 --> 01:32:46.930
dopey give you go hi am when Bonnie,
how?
That's kind of fun here.
See,

1340
01:32:46.931 --> 01:32:49.740
I feel like I,
I liked it.
It was funnier when you did it.

1341
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:52.840
It was hard to look at you.
Like,
why are you doing that?
You know,

1342
01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:59.940
it says start every conversation.
It's a very specific,
would you rather wait?

1343
01:32:59.950 --> 01:33:04.540
Which is good.
It's good to be specific.
We have for dinner and then they go,
um,

1344
01:33:04.541 --> 01:33:08.530
I'll have chicken and then you go chicken too.
Wait,
what was that?
See,

1345
01:33:08.531 --> 01:33:11.500
I think from a comedic perspective,
I would choose retarded,

1346
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:14.200
but from a life perspective,
the baby talk.

1347
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:21.340
Okay.
Um,
what'd you,
Ooh,
it's already starts off.
It starts off cut.

1348
01:33:21.370 --> 01:33:24.940
Would you rather have to wear a wet socks all day?
I hate it.

1349
01:33:25.330 --> 01:33:27.980
But you can't take off for bedtime.
God dammit.

1350
01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:33.060
Who've had his terrible or would you rather have all your meals by chewed be

1351
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:40.030
chewed by each other and fed like a baby bird for a week or wet socks or you're

1352
01:33:40.211 --> 01:33:45.160
fed food?
Like I chew it.
I got it.
I understand what baby birding is.

1353
01:33:45.161 --> 01:33:47.830
Do you know that?
Um,
something like that would chew it up,

1354
01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:51.340
threw it up and then I would chew it up and then I would,

1355
01:33:51.370 --> 01:33:55.240
then I would chew it up and then I would put it in your mouth,
chewing it up.

1356
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:57.850
The girl that did Clarissa explains it,
all of that show.

1357
01:33:57.851 --> 01:34:00.310
I think she was pre chewing.
No,
no,

1358
01:34:00.670 --> 01:34:04.300
it was the hot girl from the 90s in that Arrow Smith,

1359
01:34:05.110 --> 01:34:09.310
the clueless girl Alicia Silverstone show or something.
She was baby birding,

1360
01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:11.430
her child,
uh,

1361
01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:16.180
pre mastication where she would chew the food and then put it in our kid's mouth

1362
01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:20.590
and she was an advocate of that.
This gusting,

1363
01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:22.690
I think it's so gross though,

1364
01:34:23.230 --> 01:34:28.000

I would vomit.

1365
01:34:28.001 --> 01:34:32.500

the wet socks is horrible,

1367
01:34:35.170 --> 01:34:38.800

1370
01:34:42.970 --> 01:34:45.380
that you,
your body would just shut down.
He used to it.

1371
01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:50.000
Worst put on fresh ones leave and you step up.
