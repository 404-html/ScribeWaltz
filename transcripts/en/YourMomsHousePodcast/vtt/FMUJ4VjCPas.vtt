removal.

4
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.263
<v 1>Wow.</v>

5
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.433
Christina.

6
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.920
<v 0>All right.
Gina?
Nomadic gene SARS.</v>

7
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.183
Gotcha.

8
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.980
<v 2>Really?
I do it when I'm tired.
My vision gets worse.
Worse or why worser?</v>

9
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.870
Yeah.
No.
I noticed you said you had some farks building.
Why is that?

10
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.220
Because you gave me a really heavy Veggie Omelet.
Scrambled,
I should say.

11
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.210
It's the pregnancy scramble.
It's going to make both of us dub.
Yeah.

12
00:00:55.211 --> 00:00:59.060
You said you'd been struggling more since.
It's hard.
There's a,

13
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.840
there's a time when your intestines just get pushed all the way up.

14
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.101
You know what?

15
00:01:03.101 --> 00:01:06.550
I tried though the squatty potty today and that actually really helped.

16
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.250
What about anal?
What do you think that'll help?
I know.

17
00:01:09.251 --> 00:01:10.720
I kind of want to stick my hand.

18
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.110
If you ever have the impulse to put your finger in your butt hole to pull out

19
00:01:14.111 --> 00:01:19.030
the Ph.
The Turd.
No,
I do.
I just,
his imagination.
I want,

20
00:01:19.031 --> 00:01:23.620
you want me to put a little toy in there for you?
I mean,
that could help.
Why not?

21
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.210
Oh,
I'm so against that.
Try it out.
Try it out.
I was so afraid of that.

22
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.530
Would you let me do that to you?
Yeah.
Try it out and let you try it out.
Sure.

23
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.000
Beads.
Sure.
Why not?
Oh,
you were told lie.
I'm serious.

24
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.880
High Line in these people.
I would let you do it.

25
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:42.783
No you wouldn't.

26
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.970
<v 0>Should we do it for your birthday tomorrow?
That is my birthday.
You're right.</v>

27
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.220
Happy born day.
Tom.
I'm going to be 49 um,
yeah,
I think so.

28
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.110
How do you feel about your smurf day?
Um,
I feel pretty great about it.

29
00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.503
I'm excited.

30
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.540
<v 2>39 I know.
Can I even 40 yet?
I know,
I know.
Gross.</v>

31
00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:06.640
You're not even a person.
You don't think I'm a person yet.

32
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.600
Now 40 40 is when I think you really change.
At least for me.

33
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.540
That's when I was like,
oh,
I'm going to die soon.
Yeah.
Thank you.

34
00:02:13.541 --> 00:02:16.510
Really start to feel your mortality and things.

35
00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:18.280
Do you have a sense of urgency to them?

36
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.670
<v 0>Yeah,
I'm on the cusp of that.
I mean,
I remember,</v>

37
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.500
I remember the 29 I remember getting a,
I dunno,

38
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.300
I remember feeling like,
wow,
this actually is Hoppen Lang that's happening.

39
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.330
But I then remember that when I officially hit 30 like when it was 30th birthday

40
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:40.680
day,
I was like,
this feels different.
They usually don't feel different.

41
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.390
You go through 24 25 26 years.
I know.
Same thing these last few years,

42
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.290
35 36 37 I'm like nothing.
But I do expect that.

43
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:53.340
I don't think I'll be affected much by turning 39 no,

44
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.820
but I think that when I had the big four,
I'll be like,
whoa.

45
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.610
<v 2>It is half the point.
It's kind of,
you really are at the halfway mark.</v>

46
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.350
Theoretically.
I mean,
if you're lucky,
if you're lucky.
So scary.

47
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.830
I do think about it.
Don't want to live super old.
No,

48
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.720
no.
What?
How old do you watch it and say that it's not about the number.

49
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.670
I don't want to live for a long time in poor health.
That's how I feel.

50
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.100
See a lot of old,
like older people that,
oh my God,

51
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.520
fuck Eh.

52
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.640
And you can't not have my faculties and you know what I mean?
Yeah.

53
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.780
It was a good thing is though,
standup comedians,

54
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:35.560
because we tend to use our minds,
they we can work for,

55
00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:37.870
I mean look at Milton Berle.
How old is he?

56
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.080
We always hold either we die really young or very old.

57
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.170
Phyllis Diller like 96 and she was still performing at like 94 or something and

58
00:03:46.171 --> 00:03:50.200
hopefully all of you that,
that our fans now will be fans when you're old.

59
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.150
So he'll come see us and we'll be like,
I really did shit my pants today.

60
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:58.030
And everyone be like,
that's funny

61
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.760
James.
Yeah,
Carlin stayed fresh.

62
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.790
He was 80 something 70 he died at 70 well he did a lot of throw gas that looked

63
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:12.790
older.
He looked much older,
but he did a lot of blow.

64
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.880
I think what we've been talking about is that you can't,

65
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.200
you can't party at 50 like you did in your twenties because I think that

66
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:24.860
accelerates the aging process pretty much.
The partying,
partying,

67
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.750
I'll do it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Fuck

68
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.540
her old comedians and we fuck fucking Rickles.
He lived at night.

69
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.680
He was working and he was doing shows,
shows dude.

70
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.480
Even to Jerry Lewis.
Right.
Is he still alive?
No,
he's good.

71
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.270
He was,
you know,
talking shit all too.
He was old as fuck.
Yeah.

72
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.600
He's always for burns,
Bob red buttons,
all those guys.

73
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.100
It's your favorite.
You love those guys were all old as shit man.
Yeah,

74
00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.490
so there you go.
No,
I know.
Maybe the maybe doing comedy,

75
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:04.600
like actually being around laughing and stuff helps too and just keeping your

76
00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:09.601
mind sharp and performing and got to keep your sword sharp to 50 50 50 50 that's

77
00:05:11.581 --> 00:05:14.560
a Jerry Lewis lived so long is that it's sharpening a sword over day.

78
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.940
That'd be great.
If he turned that awful interview into a conversation,

79
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.480
the best conversation,
then I'd start to really like him.
Yeah.
He was like,

80
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.130
you know,
I can control my Oregon.

81
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.010
Nobody I know now that's an interview.
Yeah.

82
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.970
God Damn Dude.
I know.
I think about that because my parents are on that.
I mean,

83
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.250
you know your dad too,
they're in that window right before it all falls apart.

84
00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:43.720
It's falling.
Or in the last chapters.
So like I,
you get to enjoy them.

85
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.310
You know,
I do
for this last,

86
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.020
this last run.
Yeah.
This is your last hurrah.
However,

87
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.770
I feel like your mother will outlive us.
I feel like she's,

88
00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.410
she's of those going to sneak under the radar.
Yeah.
She'll be here for me.

89
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.870
Like I diet.
I hope they stick around.

90
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.030
I love your folks.
Yeah,
I do too.
I do too.
They're fun.

91
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.830
I feel like I need to try to see them more,
you know?
Hey,
I know,
you know.
Well,

92
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.690
they're coming out.
They're coming up for the birth of the kid and July.
Yup.

93
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.670
For a Carl's Jr.
Somebody said it to me the other day,

94
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.010
they're like,
what are you gonna name your son Carl's junior?
And I was like,

95
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.840
hey listen,
we're show.
Yeah.
Carl's Jr is great.
I think Domino's for this one,

96
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.000
the Carl's junior was supposed to be Ellis' name.
Yeah.
Domino's.
Oh,

97
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.670
I'm craving dominoes 24 seven with this one.
I just don't do it.

98
00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:37.190
I don't eat it all the time.
What have you named him seriously?

99
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.060
First name dominoes with the apostrophe and middle name belonging to dominate

100
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.490
the middle name.
Thin crust.
Right.
It'd be kind of cool.

101
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.690
That's what we order extra cheese.
Extra pep,

102
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.240
canny Peb when you're preggers you're stopping preggers guy.
Oh No.
Oh yeah.

103
00:06:56.241 --> 00:06:57.200
We got to get into this food.

104
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.940
Then we were going to talk about why don't we open the show in a fine show?
Shit.

105
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.790
Shit longer.
Chip Blanca.
There's a lot I want to get into.
All right.

106
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.000
Here we go.
Here we go.

107
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.680

108
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.033
All right.

109
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.760
<v 3>Hi.
Oh my God.
I'm looking for a white lady.</v>

110
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:20.890
Oh,

111
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.900
Two and dominant and be willing to put me in a dress and beat the shit out of

112
00:07:26.151 --> 00:07:30.290

Okay.

115

<v 2>In keeping with the theme that we've observed is also a shirtless guy is also.</v>

116
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.740
Sure.
Yeah.
See,

Right?
I don't even know what I was observing.

118
00:07:56.061 --> 00:08:00.230
I don't know what I was feeling.
I don't know of Fremont Street.

119
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:07.190
Are you being serious?
That's what he said.
Fremont isn't San Francisco.
I mean,

120
00:08:07.191 --> 00:08:10.950
I can only assume,
but I'm not,
I don't know.
Can I please see that again?
Oh,
sure.

121
00:08:10.951 --> 00:08:12.440
I'm so confused right now.

122
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:19.150
<v 3>Oh my God.
Looking for a white lady,</v>

<v 2>There you go.
Yeah,

126
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.920
He's got a lot going on so much.
It's like,

127
00:08:36.921 --> 00:08:41.120
where do you begin with a click list on the doctor drew a check.
That's right.

128
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:46.850
I'm gonna call this one the city of Fremont Street.
Accurate name for the file.

129
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:51.480
So see a Fremont,

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:13.390
Here's what I find interesting about again,
everything.

135
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:17.320
Almost like a bag.
Yeah.
Submissively I'm looking for this and,

136
00:09:17.321 --> 00:09:19.720
but then he switches it and gets agro.
I agree.

137
00:09:19.721 --> 00:09:21.610
I'm not sure what the tactic is here.

138
00:09:21.611 --> 00:09:25.000
Is it to shame her or to woo her in with his submission?

139
00:09:25.001 --> 00:09:30.001
I don't know because it kind of seems like to me that maybe the tactic is by

140
00:09:30.251 --> 00:09:35.110
insulting the potential dominant person.
Oh,
we're aggressive.

141
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:39.220
He's going to antagonize her and then she's going to come with a fury and a

142
00:09:39.221 --> 00:09:43.420
really tight dress.
Yeah.
You better wear this dress.
You fucking sissy.
Yeah.

143
00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:47.050
Really beat the shit out of him.
I'm like,
yeah,
because usually you don't see,

144
00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.680
I want to be submissive,
beat the shit out of me and then you bitch,

145
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:51.670
you stupid because they don't,

146
00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:55.720
I didn't know that they could insult the dom that was protocol.

147
00:09:55.750 --> 00:10:00.220
Maybe he just really wants his ass kicked.
I'm more intrigued with his hair.

148
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:01.303
Yes.

149
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.990
And that's why we're married.
Yeah.
I,
I,
I'm more intrigued.

150
00:10:07.991 --> 00:10:09.760
All the things going on visually,

151
00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:15.240
I'm more intrigued with the selection of which teeth he chose to keep.

152
00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:17.230
You know what I mean?

153
00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:22.410
I also like the framing that he [inaudible] six feet above the head so you can

154
00:10:22.451 --> 00:10:26.800
see the ceiling really clearly.
Now the sound was good.
Yeah.

155
00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.660
He's got a newer phone.
Who's got an yeah.
Um,

156
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.670
but I'm just saying why keep the entire bottom row of teeth and then none of the

157
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.320
top
and the bottom is really gray and yellow

158
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.680
like you.
Interesting.
Yeah.
Like why keen to jump.

159
00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.710
One to jump.
One to jump.

160
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.030
<v 5>Yup.
Yup.</v>

161
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.570
<v 2>But why preserve just those like you,</v>

162
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.050
you can clearly you're capable of keeping some of them.

163
00:10:57.051 --> 00:11:00.590
Why not try to keep all of them.
Yeah.
That's a really good question.

164
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:05.210
So really good.
How much for you to fulfill this man's desires,
Tom?

165
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:09.800
Oh my God.
Let's talk a dollar amount.
I mean mouth mouthwash.

166
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.110
Who's loud mouth.
Are you more into his?

167
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.380
I'll tell you.
I'll the other guys.
Yeah.

168
00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:27.680
Only because this guy's mouth smells of booze too.
This one here soaked in booze.

169
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:32.150
It smells like a,
like a warm beer.
Yeah.
You don't think the other guy drinks?

170
00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.570
Not like this guy.
This guy's been drinking all day.

171
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:36.903
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

172
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.070
<v 2>That's pretty bad.
Now,
what do you think?
They're both pretty disgusted.</v>

173
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:42.960
Pretty Ratchet,
but see,

174
00:11:42.961 --> 00:11:45.960
I think the other guys are more disgusting human being overall.

175
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.650
Why do you say that now?
That's an interesting,
he's a grocer dude.
Yeah,

176
00:11:49.651 --> 00:11:50.610
because this guy is clean,

177
00:11:50.611 --> 00:11:55.090
like he's got a clean pair of jeans so you just didn't have any regard for his

178
00:11:55.091 --> 00:11:59.560
teeth.
But I mean the other one is sunscreen.
No,
yeah,
no,

179
00:11:59.561 --> 00:12:03.790
he's been outdoors for awhile about doors for 50,
60 years.
But he's,

180
00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:08.740
the other guy is,
I mean,
I wouldn't be surprised if the other guy keeps,

181
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:13.620
you know,
toenail clippings and like she was on the floor and then walks on.

182
00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.593
He's just,

183
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.510
he's really bright house.
He's a specialty.
Disgusting.

184
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.780
He's got more mental problems.
This guy is just a fun drunk.
Yeah.

185
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:35.350
This guy's parlor trick
highs,

186
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.410
Madison and salts ditch.

187
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:46.210
He hates himself and then he hates the person that he's asking.
The favor.

188
00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.630
Just hates himself.
Yeah.
It's all projection.

189
00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:52.600
That's hilarious.

190
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:57.610
A lot of people are probably going to see

191
00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:04.590
the parallels between him asking for that favor.

192
00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:11.010
And then,
uh,
the piss on me beat me guy.
You know,

193
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:14.680
there are many.
Yeah.
We've uncovered,
by the way,

194
00:13:14.681 --> 00:13:19.450
this isn't your mom's house exclusive.
Yeah.
We introduced the bill,

195
00:13:19.451 --> 00:13:21.910
the truck out and we're fucking pissed.
Let me try it out and see.

196
00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.570
Shares applied only as fuck man.
I'm looking at the heart.

197
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.510
See The differences that this guy is definitely amped up on some

198
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.260
10 once the girl should.
Yeah.

199
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.650
But the other guy I feel like is maybe not into drugs,
you know,
we don't know.

200
00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:39.900
He doesn't look good.

201
00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:45.070
Nothing looks good for sure on any of the people that we are.

202
00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:47.880
Show policy is.
If it looks good,
don't play it.

203
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.790
But yeah,
I mean this guy,

204
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:56.350
this guy is in overdrive asking for his favor.

205
00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:01.840
The other guy is actually pretty chill about it.
While I was going to say,

206
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:06.850
here's a really creepy child.
Your mom's house has broken so many videos,
genres,

207
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:12.220
the boring video and really born so many stars.
The FARC videos,

208
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.130
the dad Boehner videos,

209
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.930
and now we're breaking the overly excitable sexual request videos.

210
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:24.280
It's just exciting when we come up with a new genre,
we break barriers.

211
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:28.600
Glass ceilings shatter on this show.
Yeah.
This guys hopped up on drugs.

212
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:32.500
The other guy,
you could see him,
the lighting was better.

213
00:14:32.501 --> 00:14:34.870
The sound was again shirtless.

214
00:14:34.871 --> 00:14:38.800
So he does meet the criteria is huge here.

215
00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:40.060
It's really something.

216
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.900
And you have to have a shitty apartment background that you got to see.

217
00:14:43.901 --> 00:14:48.670
Like a ceiling track.
Yes.
Like a cottage cheese ceiling.

218
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:52.010
I was surprised how a doctor drew

219
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.630
<v 6>led with that on every analysis.
He's like,</v>

220
00:14:53.631 --> 00:14:56.940
let's see what's going on in this apartment.
I had never really been,

221
00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:01.250
I would always be focused on what the day looks like or what he said.
But no,

222
00:15:01.251 --> 00:15:04.580
Andrew look around.
It was like,
hmm.
Yeah.

223
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.480
Really the best Dick Whore.
Well,

224
00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:12.510
with the guy with the breathing and the Cop d,
is that the word?
Um,

225
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.470
his closet was behind him and you could see how disheveled his,
oh,

226
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:20.510
that guy's really,
really crazy and really high.
Yeah.
Yeah.

227
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.040
He's really disorganized.

228
00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.393
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

229
00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.570
<v 6>Yeah.
And mentally too.
Now who do you think's the most fucked up?</v>

230
00:15:32.571 --> 00:15:35.720
So the Cop d guy,
the piss on me,
beat me.

231
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:40.220
Now we've got Julian Fellowes teeth.
Uh,
here's the thing about piss on me.

232
00:15:40.221 --> 00:15:45.221
Beat me guy is that he might just be super fucked up in the sense that he is

233
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.670
chemically fucked up with everything with drugs.
Oh,

234
00:15:52.671 --> 00:15:57.020
it's drawing might be able to behave normally not high when he's sober.
Right?

235
00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.150
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a totally,

236
00:15:59.151 --> 00:16:02.480
I mean it's like anybody could fall into that trap in the way.
In other words,

237
00:16:02.481 --> 00:16:06.230
if you put me on drugs and alcohol and make a video,

238
00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:08.210
it's not going to be sign,
be a good video,

239
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:13.810
but I might be able to keep it together sober.
You know,
you really think no,

240
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:16.090
I would just,
let me just hear what you,
let me get hit when we need you here for,

241
00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:17.270
you're hearing your argument correctly.

242
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:22.540
You're saying that the piss on me beat me gay when sober is somehow sane.

243
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:26.420
Like he,
he could be like you or me.
Maybe not.
No,

244
00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:30.590
not like you or me because he's not normal.
Right.
Okay.

245
00:16:30.591 --> 00:16:34.610
And he's not in the circle of normal.
Oh,
what I'm saying,

246
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.120
we're seeing him only amped up on dust and so this is a real heightened version

247
00:16:42.561 --> 00:16:47.330
of who he is.
Yeah,
yeah.
It's a good word for it.
He is.
I am that,
you know,

248
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:52.250
uh,
also CLPD d guy,
he's also is fucking all his videos,

249
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:57.970
but I think his eyes are more clearly mentally ill and so like you would

250
00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:03.800
register more like a,
a shooter,
like a fucking,
you know.
Well yeah cause he's,

251
00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:08.540
I think the CLPD guy also has delusions.
Yeah.
No,
he's really sick.
He's really,

252
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.870
yeah,
but pace on the beat me

253
00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.920
<v 7>Guy Piss</v>

254
00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.720
<v 6>on me,
beat me guy.
I feel like probably has a job cause some,
yeah.</v>

255
00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.530
And he's gainfully employed.

256
00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:23.550
He's got keys to can tell him like I need you to get this done.
And he'd be like,

257
00:17:23.551 --> 00:17:26.280
all right,
drop it off over here.
Yeah.
He would do it,

258
00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:31.020
but fucking CLPD guys held and capable.
He'd be like,

259
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:34.380
well I was walking out,
I see what you're trying to do to me.

260
00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:39.150
And he's super paranoid.
He's like,
I fucking set that shit all fire ass hole.

261
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:43.170
Right.
Okay.
Hyper paranoid now.
What about the right now?
Right now,
right now.

262
00:17:43.171 --> 00:17:47.850
Right now.
Super Paranoid.
Fucked up guy.
I think he might be bipolar.
Yeah.

263
00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.010
I'm gonna to go with or manic

264
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.430
<v 2>depression,
the mood swing.
I think there might,</v>

265
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.190
there might be an element of mania to that right now.
Right now.

266
00:17:56.191 --> 00:18:01.010
Right now that none may not just be drugs because that feels like mental
illness.

267
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.620
Yeah,
that's mania.
Let sounds like me.
You know what?

268
00:18:04.621 --> 00:18:07.780
All good questions for doctor drew.
Next time he gets in here,
he can,
um,

269
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:12.750
tell us the,
it's Matt Manic here.

270
00:18:12.751 --> 00:18:16.950
How manic that is.
Now this guy,

271
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:18.151
which,
okay,

272
00:18:18.151 --> 00:18:22.170
so now that we've gone through all of our Sickos Julian Fellowes teeth here,

273
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:27.090
I feel as though he might just genuinely be an old school,

274
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.060
hundred percent homegrown SF pervert.

275
00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:35.500
Just a hardcore guy who just leads with his Dick and he's putting himself out

276
00:18:36.061 --> 00:18:39.690
there.
Like he might be the most normal he might be.

277
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:44.370
Yeah.
Cause he seemed sober.
I would say that he's sober in that video.

278
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.770
He's keys kinky.
He's weird.

279
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:51.260
He's the guy who when he's waiting to pick up his coffee goes,
um,

280
00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:55.950
put a little extra cream in that when everybody goes like,
come on man.

281
00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:00.480
And then Lyle gets a little kick out of it.
And you're like,
he comes in here,

282
00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.770
he says stuff like that,
you know,
like,
but he's not really,
he's,

283
00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:07.140
he's a creeper.
He'll come in,

284
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:11.040
he'll get off of his bicycle and he'll be wearing like the tight bicycle shorts

285
00:19:11.041 --> 00:19:13.650
and like the clicky clicky shoes or something.

286
00:19:13.651 --> 00:19:17.650
And he'll come in and he'll be annoying and he'll be gross like you said.
Yeah.

287
00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.090
Yeah.
But he's not mentally,
I don't think he's mentally ill.

288
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.020
I think he's just got a kink.
Yeah.
Well we'll see.
You know,
then again,

289
00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:27.630
I feel that way about a lot of these guys.
Excuse me.

290
00:19:27.631 --> 00:19:31.350
And then two or three videos deep and you're like,
oh,
there's a lot more.

291
00:19:31.351 --> 00:19:33.690
Show you having a lot more shit happening.
Well,

292
00:19:33.691 --> 00:19:36.600
I hope he finds his padded white slut

293
00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:42.540
pretty soon.
Hope she beats the shit out of him.
He's so,

294
00:19:42.541 --> 00:19:45.120
and another thing too is that he's got an extra chin,

295
00:19:45.121 --> 00:19:49.200
like a lot of Chin meat and you think that you'd record from the top,

296
00:19:49.201 --> 00:19:51.800
but he does it from the bottom.
Not flattering or

297
00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.060
not flattering.
That's true.
No,
it's not very good.
Um,

298
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:05.100
yeah.
See it's not a good angle.
You're not,
you're not doing yourself any favors.

299
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:12.360
He's just a perv that is a,
yeah,

300
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:17.100
it's very hanky.
That second chin.
Um,
yeah,

301
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:20.550
it just reminds me of what,
um,
we're watched Turkey.

302
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:26.070
Andre the giant document.
Oh yeah.
And there's a,
the interview.

303
00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.650
I've interviewed a bunch of people.
It's,
it's really good.
Yeah.

304
00:20:28.651 --> 00:20:32.730
Really good documentary.
Always loved Andre the giant,
but knew nothing about him.

305
00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:37.920
Um,
and uh,
Bill Simmons Company did this.

306
00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:42.420
It's a really cool documentary.
It shows all of,
uh,

307
00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:47.400
like his whole story where he started in,
uh,

308
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:48.430
France,
France,

309
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:52.030
<v 6>and,
and they,
they have this where the naked ladies dance,</v>

310
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:57.540
like really in depth look at his upbringing and how this,

311
00:20:57.641 --> 00:21:01.630
you know,
he was like a normal size kid,
which is,
you know,

312
00:21:01.631 --> 00:21:04.690
you just don't picture him like that.
And then he had this,

313
00:21:04.691 --> 00:21:08.920
a pituitary just kicked in around 15,

314
00:21:08.921 --> 00:21:11.340
which sounds about right,
right?
Like adolescence.

315
00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:18.330
You really turned into an actual verifiable giant.
And he has,

316
00:21:18.331 --> 00:21:21.300
Oregon's kept growing because he refused medical treatment.

317
00:21:21.301 --> 00:21:24.030
And what happens is everything gets bigger,
but your heart doesn't.

318
00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.330
Oregon's are squishing.
And,

319
00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.570
and the thing is they offered him a surgery after he was already enormous,

320
00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.210
so it would have been fine because he was worried about,

321
00:21:33.211 --> 00:21:38.000
oh well my whole career go away.
Yeah,
you're not going to shrink.
And,
uh,

322
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.320
so he just kept growing and it's sad.
It's very sad.
But,
um,

323
00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:43.490
but to your point,

324
00:21:43.491 --> 00:21:47.930
I believe you wanted to bring up his friend friend trying to find this.
Uh,

325
00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:52.880
let me see this.
I had,
I had this photo,
um,
at your insistence,

326
00:21:52.881 --> 00:21:56.030
actually you,
uh,
this man appeared on screen.
You Go,

327
00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:01.010
we have to look at this guy to study him.
Yeah.
Well,

328
00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.890
you know,
here's the thing.
I am,
I am by no means a supermodel.

329
00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.630
I don't think Tom claims to be a model.

330
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:09.600
We were not in show business for our looks.
Uh,

331
00:22:09.601 --> 00:22:13.920
but I do know that when a camera is on me,
I try,
I try to look good.

332
00:22:13.921 --> 00:22:16.560
Like even today,
I have makeup.
It's Sunday.
I'm pregnant.

333
00:22:16.561 --> 00:22:19.530
I don't want to put on makeup.
I do because I know the Internet is watching.

334
00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:24.420
And when you're on camera you should just try to clean up a little bit of what's

335
00:22:24.421 --> 00:22:27.450
there.
That's all I'm trying to say.
Oh,

336
00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:32.460
work with what God gave you a hygiene,
you know,
grooming,

337
00:22:32.461 --> 00:22:36.480
basic grooming stuff.
That's all right.
Yeah.
A model.

338
00:22:36.481 --> 00:22:39.670
And this is a bad look dude.
This here.

339
00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:45.600
Yeah,
it's a lot of red is drinking,
right?

340
00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:51.150
Yeah.
But it's just interesting.
Facial hair.
It's more let's start from,
yeah.
Okay.

341
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.580
Look,

342
00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:55.850
I don't understand what's going on because it's what connects is down here air.

343
00:22:56.510 --> 00:23:01.100
Then he shaves off the whole Chin but leaves a chin strap.

344
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:03.170
Just a little chin strap at the bottom.

345
00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:08.920
Nothing underneath that they send out thins out the part between the top of the

346
00:23:09.861 --> 00:23:13.570
mustache in the nose.
That's like pencil thin Pierre.
Yeah,

347
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:17.750
it is very odd.
It's a very,
uh,

348
00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:22.310
cause I'll tell you as a guy with a beard and who observes beers with this guy

349
00:23:22.311 --> 00:23:27.140
needs is first of all,
why don't dip it low here.

350
00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:32.060
Okay.
See how he dips it low?
Yes.
Exposes more of this cheek fat here.

351
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:37.510
You want to cover that and then you see this here definitely cover because this

352
00:23:37.941 --> 00:23:41.780
just looks like you're in a period piece.
There's no reason for this at all.

353
00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:46.220
Exposed.
And then I would let this grow.
You want to just cover

354
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.330
<v 2>some of this loose meat right here cause it's,
he's got to go at that neat cause.</v>

355
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:52.370
Here's my highlighting the gullet.

356
00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:56.960
The beard is meant to kind of conceal your imperfections,
which I'm all for.

357
00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:57.741
I get it.

358
00:23:57.741 --> 00:24:02.741
Now what his mistake was is that he tried to contour his face with the beard.

359
00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:06.980
Sometimes guys with really huge faces too who have no,
no sense.

360
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:11.360
No Sim was at all of of a jaw line.
We'll make a fake job.

361
00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:15.570
So they go like this where the job would be.
Then there's just a,

362
00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.760
it's like somebody drew,

363
00:24:16.761 --> 00:24:20.140
it's like a surgeon's about to perform and they draw like here's where I'm going

364
00:24:20.141 --> 00:24:21.140
to make my incisions.

365
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:25.450
That's what they draw and they think that that's giving the illusion that you're

366
00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:26.300
seeing a jaw line,

367
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:31.040
but it actually makes the face look thinner and weirder because all you're doing

368
00:24:31.041 --> 00:24:35.060
is looking at the line.
Looks Fair.
Noticing that all of this,
you're,
you actually,

369
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:39.410
it looks worse.
It looks worse.
This is just,

370
00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.150
this is just bad,

371
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:47.320
bad work on bad concept and bad execution as a beer kind of shore yourself.

372
00:24:48.011 --> 00:24:51.800
What do you,
so what are you suggesting he should do?
Well,
he should,
first of all,

373
00:24:51.801 --> 00:24:56.600
he should just um,
saying,
fill this out.
Don't tip this down.
No,

374
00:24:56.601 --> 00:24:58.950
keep it.
What's the line that he should keep?

375
00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:04.040
He should go like he should go from here.
Yeah.
Across here.

376
00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:07.370
Fill this in.
Fill this in completely.

377
00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:11.720
[inaudible] for those of you who are listening is this guys,
first of all,

378
00:25:11.721 --> 00:25:14.630
he's got a very,
he's a white guy with a very red,
red,

379
00:25:14.631 --> 00:25:19.380
red face and then he's got like a white beard like that.
Kenny Rogers White,

380
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:23.330
but it's a super short shortly crowd and beard.
This is,

381
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:24.800
and it's on since.

382
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:28.880
And He's got his entire chin cut out of the beer except for little chin strap

383
00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:33.760
buckle like you're buckling and helmet on.
He left a little bit underneath it.

384
00:25:33.761 --> 00:25:36.430
One of the more bizarre beards I've ever seen me til.

385
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.880
It's just doesn't make sense.
And he's American.
He's not like,
yeah,
no,

386
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:43.790
he's not choice.
Speaking of nationalities by the way,

387
00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:48.830
but know all respect to to uh,
Andre and his friend here.

388
00:25:48.831 --> 00:25:50.390
But you do need beard help.
Okay.

389
00:25:50.391 --> 00:25:54.230
I was just trying to help and choices.

390
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:58.850
What do you think of my fashion's today?
Oh,
I,
I think you're,

391
00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:00.850
you're out of your fucking mind here.

392
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:06.140
I think that you've officially gone over to my team of euro trash.
Yeah.

393
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:10.200
I don't know how it happened.
You and I kind of switched places here.
Uh,

394
00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.530
I think if you were to land in Budapest today,

395
00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:16.140
people would start speaking Hungarian deal.
Really?
Oh my God.

396
00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:20.210
You could be related to me right now.
Like you can be legit,
one of my cousins,

397
00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:25.160
but the only thing you need is some white jeans.
Yeah.
Cause that's,

398
00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.080
you know,
you're still looking to American here,

399
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:29.510
but that is a wild jacket for those of you listening.

400
00:26:29.511 --> 00:26:34.511
He's wearing a tie dye powder blue Adidas old school,

401
00:26:34.821 --> 00:26:39.420
three stripe,
like zip up.
Right.
Which are my favorite,
but like my frames,

402
00:26:39.421 --> 00:26:43.860
crazy blue patterns on it.
Crazy psychedelic.
Yeah.
It's,
it's

403
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.390
<v 6>really out of your wheelhouse.</v>

404
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.850
I don't know what possessed you to wear this,
like feeling inside?

405
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:56.210
I just feel like it was my birthday and um,

406
00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:01.210
I'm Stella.
I'm getting my groove back.
Yeah,
sounds like that.
Oh,

407
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:03.420
it looks good on you.
I will say I'm very jealous.

408
00:27:03.421 --> 00:27:04.860
I kind of wish I had one like that.

409
00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:08.550
This is something that's totally in your wheelhouse with regard to Andre is that

410
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:14.100
he was purported to be an amazing farter.
I know.

411
00:27:14.101 --> 00:27:17.670
I love this part about the documentary covered in the dock for people that,

412
00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:22.210
that's so funny.
Oh,
Vince Mcmahon talking.
Yeah.

413
00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:24.880
Well he would be talking if I gave him the volume.

414
00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:27.810
All right,
go

415
00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:33.070
<v 1>Andre.
So enjoyed flatulence when he pascal said it was,</v>

416
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:37.360
it was an event,
my kind of guy,
flatulence,

417
00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:42.720
that was his trademark and he had a real knack for lifting his left leg.

418
00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:47.110
I would seem go into the launch position and I'd say,
Oh my God,

419
00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:51.280
Harry clubs,
you've never heard anything like it.

420
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:55.360
It sounded like,
you know,
like a deep roar kind of like thing.
It would rumble

421
00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:04.910
the sound of,
of Andrea taken a fart.
Taking off.
Take it off.

422
00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:09.180
They were loud.
Big Man.
Big Farm.
Yeah.
Yeah.

423
00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:13.160
Get you in an elevator and couple of those long,
42nd forts.

424
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:15.370
The song like skim was slapping me go.

425
00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:21.490
I remember every once in a while the charter plane,
but to see the pilots,

426
00:28:21.491 --> 00:28:23.710
you know,
almost like somebody get smoke in their eyes.

427
00:28:23.711 --> 00:28:26.740
I'm a direct the plane on reed.
You can't form like that.

428
00:28:26.741 --> 00:28:31.400
And your pants were pilots will be
f.
Dot.
God never again.

429
00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:32.680
Never on this plan again.

430
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:35.190
<v 6>That's pretty cool.
Huh?
Big Man.
Big Fart.</v>

431
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:39.020
That's what they should have called this documentary.
Yeah,
I know.
That's it.
No,

432
00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:43.140
this was the tombstone.
Big Man.
Big Man.

433
00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:47.640
Big floods.
Even bigger.
Yeah.
That would be a contest.

434
00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.970
Yeah.
Andre versus a king ass rapper.
Well,

435
00:28:50.971 --> 00:28:55.170
I think it's funny that what everybody remembers of a man's life.

436
00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.710
His farts.
That's pretty impressive.
They're just saying,
you know,

437
00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.470
it's one of the things they talked about his drinking too.
Remember that?
Yeah.

438
00:29:01.471 --> 00:29:03.720
He's a real boozer said,
you know,
it got,

439
00:29:03.721 --> 00:29:06.900
it got to a point of mythology about his drinking,
but the,

440
00:29:06.901 --> 00:29:09.540
but a couple people were like,
well,
you know,
his standard,

441
00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.900
like his evening out began with 24 beers,

442
00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:17.550
24 and then like three bottles of wine and you would drink those.
Uh,
they,
uh,

443
00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.860
Rob Reiner said,
you know,
I'm princess bride.
He's like,

444
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.010
what'd you drink is like God,
like four bottles of wine,
three bottles of Cognac.

445
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.820
And they're like,
are you,
are you drunk?
And he was like,
ready to go look,

446
00:29:26.821 --> 00:29:29.520
what do you want to do?
And he would start in the morning of shooting,

447
00:29:29.521 --> 00:29:31.710
which is pretty funny.
But to him,
you know,

448
00:29:31.711 --> 00:29:35.070
a bottle of wine is like a glass of wine.
Oh,
I know is because he's a giant.

449
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.630
He's like enormous.
Yeah.

450
00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:40.410
Hey know he must've showed up holding a beer and it looked like a look like one

451
00:29:40.411 --> 00:29:42.040
of those mini,
oh my God.

452
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.970
<v 2>Yeah.
His paws were just tremendous.</v>

453
00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:48.370
They showed a here like it's size 22 ring,
which I don't,
I don't,

454
00:29:48.371 --> 00:29:51.770
I'm sure that's not even something that they had,
you know,

455
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:53.900
everything is custom made for him and uh,

456
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:58.660
like a regular guy put three fingers in,
they tend to ring and it makes me think,

457
00:29:58.661 --> 00:30:01.150
what do you think the,
uh,
speaking of three fingers,

458
00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.740
but do you think downstairs was like,
well,

459
00:30:02.741 --> 00:30:06.910
I mean his finger itself had to be like a normal dog sausage.
Yeah,

460
00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.970
he's crying.
He's just like tap,
tap,
tap in away in there.

461
00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.250
What they said that he was really big with the ladies.

462
00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:16.390
Everybody was curious about what kind of horse cock this guy had on him.
Well,

463
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:20.920
kind of makes me think though that if it's anything proportionate to him,

464
00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:25.360
they would just damage most women.
It's more of a novelty thing.

465
00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.690
I don't think you'd want that on a regular,
I mean at least personally,

466
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:32.620
it's kind of like giving birth to a kid all the time.
It was up to a seven,
four,

467
00:30:32.621 --> 00:30:36.670
500 and everything on him was just so big.

468
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.530
How big was nuts?
That's more,
I think that's even funnier.

469
00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:44.170
Like carry around those big ass giant balls.
What about that thrust power though?

470
00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:47.980
No,
I don't think he could cause at towards the end.
Like his back was.

471
00:30:47.981 --> 00:30:52.390
So what about in his prime?
You don't think you want that guy on top of you?

472
00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.230
I'd be scared.
I think most people would be like,
you lay on your back,

473
00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:01.490
you know it was cow girl the way have you had like just wait,

474
00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:06.370
just waves of load that it would just take 25 seconds.

475
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:12.280
And he ah,
I'm curious about,
you know,

476
00:31:12.281 --> 00:31:15.850
and this is one thing that the documentary did an address and I think we're all

477
00:31:15.851 --> 00:31:19.200
upset about what,
where his dumps,
like we know about the hearts.

478
00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:22.030
What about the dump though?
It had to be really insane.

479
00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.090
Shit's must've been bananas.
Of course.

480
00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:29.320
I can't believe that guy could shit on a normal toilet.
I'm imagining,

481
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:33.040
and that was the saddest part actually about this documentary is that he spent

482
00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:36.720
most of his life on the road and it's years ago.

483
00:31:36.721 --> 00:31:40.780
It was before like modern day accommodation.
I mean,

484
00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:45.160
I had a lot of empathy as I know you did for his travel burdens,
travel,
Burns,

485
00:31:45.161 --> 00:31:45.994
and then um,

486
00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:50.920
getting on airplanes and having to take up too regular economy seats and then

487
00:31:50.921 --> 00:31:52.360
not being able to urinate.

488
00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:57.280
Like he'd go to Japan from the states can fit in the laboratory and he couldn't

489
00:31:57.281 --> 00:32:00.880
be swayed to like pee in a bucket and then put the bucket in the toilet and they

490
00:32:00.881 --> 00:32:03.520
would just pull the curtain piss in a bucket.

491
00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:07.720
So sad and dumped a bucket and then beds and cars and just must've been

492
00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:13.510
horrible.
Yeah.
Well anyway,
fascinating documentary.

493
00:32:13.511 --> 00:32:17.350
Very well done.
Really,
really good.
I really enjoyed that.
Um,

494
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:19.030
and I do this real quick.

495
00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:23.050
I want to give this shout out because nothing is more exciting than free stuff.

496
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:28.240
And I came home from this last week in Atlanta too.

497
00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:32.260
So much free stuff.
It's always just,
I mean,
I feel very lucky to get it,

498
00:32:32.261 --> 00:32:36.910
but I just wanted to,
I got tons of stuff from roots of fight,
all those t shirts,

499
00:32:36.911 --> 00:32:40.650
sweatshirts,
all that fight stuff.
Yes.
Yes.
That was awesome.
Oh,

500
00:32:40.651 --> 00:32:42.950
I remember I had to model it for me.
It was great.

501
00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:48.070
<v 0>Uh,
the undefeated sent me shoes and hats.
Thank you for that.</v>

502
00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:51.580
Um,
I forget the guy's name.
Is it Jesse?
I don't know his name,
but um,

503
00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.710
the team and undefeated if you know anyone there.

504
00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.240
Thank you guys for sending that.

505
00:32:55.690 --> 00:33:00.250
I got coffee from smoking aces in Lexington and somebody who was at my show,

506
00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:03.310
I spoke to him for a minute during the show,
sent me coffee.

507
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.590
We've got a big day from biobee day,
which is getting installed Monday.

508
00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:11.770
I am so excited for this big day.
Yeah.

509
00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.250
So I don't have a review yet because we haven't used it,
but it's,

510
00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:18.210
it's getting installed.
And then I also wanted to shout out to,
um,

511
00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:20.860
cause I remember if I,
you know,
with,
with this schedule,
with the movie,

512
00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:24.370
it really fucked up when I remember if I said something and everything's like

513
00:33:24.371 --> 00:33:26.020
out of order.
Um,

514
00:33:26.021 --> 00:33:29.200
but I did rogue and the other day if you want to see that I was on a Joe's

515
00:33:29.201 --> 00:33:31.960
podcast.
I did cold bear a few weeks ago.

516
00:33:31.961 --> 00:33:34.420
If I don't know if I mentioned it on this,
on this show or not.

517
00:33:34.421 --> 00:33:38.830
Did I tell the Jared subway story?
So it's a,

518
00:33:38.831 --> 00:33:40.660
it's funny if you want to check it out loud,
people ask me,

519
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:43.720
do you guys talk about politics because I don't want to watch it.
And I'm like,

520
00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:48.240
no.
So there's no politics.
Um,
you can just watch it if you want.
And I did.

521
00:33:48.241 --> 00:33:52.300
Jesus and Miro,
um,
the viceland show,
if you want to watch that,

522
00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:53.590
I'm on an episode of that too.

523
00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:57.090
So I'm just plugging those things because they were all fun to do a lot of

524
00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.980
publicity for your special,
a lot of publicity for the special.
Yeah.

525
00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.480
<v 2>It's wonderful.
Yeah.
Most importantly,</v>

526
00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:04.850
and I don't know if you're ready to bring it up,
but I'm so excited.

527
00:34:04.851 --> 00:34:09.680
I'm so chomping at the bit
to start talking about this cause we,

528
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:12.050
we sat around yesterday.
Yeah.

529
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:17.210
And I've been thinking about it ever since.
Okay.
I mean,
are you ready?
Okay.

530
00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:21.350
Well we were talking about,
we,
we had some friends come over and we thought,

531
00:34:21.351 --> 00:34:24.410
why don't we get like some donuts for them?
Yeah,
that's right.

532
00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:26.780
And the friend goes,
you know what,

533
00:34:26.781 --> 00:34:29.390
actually we're not going to eat them or pretty health conscious.
And we're like,

534
00:34:29.391 --> 00:34:31.460
yeah,
we are too.
We just thought it would be funny.

535
00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:35.570
We haven't had donuts in forever.
Yeah.
And then we got to thinking like,

536
00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.270
what's your favorite doughnuts?
What's your favorites?

537
00:34:38.490 --> 00:34:41.360
If you're going to do a doughnut run,
what would you get?
Personally,

538
00:34:41.361 --> 00:34:44.090
I'm a cake all the way.
Yeah.
I hate 'em.

539
00:34:44.091 --> 00:34:46.580
I don't know what the other one is called.
The batter or something.

540
00:34:46.581 --> 00:34:49.760
I don't like that squishy.
I don't like shit with Jelly.
Very light.

541
00:34:49.910 --> 00:34:54.140
It's a lighter cake is heavier,
like heavy.
And I like some chocolate frosting.

542
00:34:54.141 --> 00:34:57.230
I like my sprinkles on there.
Yeah.
But,
um,

543
00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:01.610
fuck anything with like a jelly filling.
I fucking hate that.
Like,
uh,

544
00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:06.380
I don't like those.
Um,
what else do we hate?
What else do you hate?

545
00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:10.280
A,
yeah,
I'm not into the jellies and jams and it's gross.

546
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.960
I bear claws.

547
00:35:11.961 --> 00:35:16.780
I can tolerate for like two bites and then I'm really old branch coolers.
Oh,

548
00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:21.290
is that,
oh,
the chocolate topping whiskeys circled one.
Yeah.
I like those.

549
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:25.250
<v 0>Those are good.
Um,
uh,
I mean a regular old fashioned glaze</v>

550
00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:29.490
<v 2>I love and all cash and glaze can do that.
I like those.
I used to say,</v>

551
00:35:29.491 --> 00:35:33.720
let me get a dozen classics.
Classics.
Yeah.
Um,
I do however,

552
00:35:33.721 --> 00:35:38.220
enjoy a Krispy Kreme in.
I know that's not a cake doughnut.
If it's fresh and hot.

553
00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:42.420
<v 6>Oh my God.
Yeah,
I do like the donut holes.
Here's what happened.</v>

554
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:45.150
And when I like it,
everything donut with all the disgusting crumbs.

555
00:35:45.151 --> 00:35:48.360
The ones that you get at.
Um,
I know I'm not a Dunkin donuts person,

556
00:35:48.361 --> 00:35:53.170
but I do like that they're everything.
Donate
the crumbs.

557
00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:57.000
Having the,
what's your favorite one would if you're making it.
Yes.

558
00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.870
And then from there it went to how many of those things you could eat?

559
00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:05.480
In other words,
if,
if you go like a crispy creme,
fresh hot one.
Yeah.

560
00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:06.900
How many could you handle?
Both.

561
00:36:06.901 --> 00:36:10.390
And then we talked about how many you could eat before you felt sick,
you know.

562
00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:14.370
Well,
the Krispy Kreme,
I think before you feel sick is one,
let's be honest.

563
00:36:14.371 --> 00:36:17.970
Like you eat it,
it tastes good.
And then I'm already like such a sugar rush.

564
00:36:17.971 --> 00:36:21.900
It's so much.
It's overwhelming and it's good.
But Krispy Kreme,

565
00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:27.180
realistically,
I could eat maybe three before I want it.
Before I vomited.

566
00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:30.750
You think so?
I think you would vomit after three any more than three.

567
00:36:30.751 --> 00:36:35.700
And I would,
I would feel so sick.
I definitely can't do it pregnant.
Um,

568
00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:40.320
but
how about you?
I don't know.
I mean,
I definitely,

569
00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:45.410
I've never done more than one or two of those hot Krispy Kreme ones.

570
00:36:46.351 --> 00:36:50.010
You know,
you never don't more.
Number two,
I've never bought them.
In other words,

571
00:36:50.011 --> 00:36:53.100
I've only had them when I am in an office.
I've never,

572
00:36:53.101 --> 00:36:57.780
I've never actually stopped in and purchase.
Oh yeah,
I know,
right?
Never.

573
00:36:57.781 --> 00:37:01.890
I've had doughnut holes.
Those are not from there.

574
00:37:01.891 --> 00:37:04.830
From like a Dunkin donuts or something.
Again,
I liked the cake version.

575
00:37:04.831 --> 00:37:09.150
I don't hate the mushy,
whatever the fuck that is.
So I wonder,

576
00:37:09.151 --> 00:37:13.470
but how many could I max out on
the donut holes?

577
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:16.990
I'm wondering that one right now.
So here's,
here's,
here's,
here's,
wait.
Yeah,

578
00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:20.100
I think the chocolate doughnut holes are usually,

579
00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:24.370
I feel like those are cake like we're talking about.
And then that the,

580
00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.170
that the glazed ones might be no,

581
00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:32.020
it's how old fashion it could be either.
Or you can get them old fashioned homes.

582
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:36.150
Okay.
So anyway,
what's your favorite let,
let's start there.
Like what is,

583
00:37:36.151 --> 00:37:39.240
what's the donut that you can eat the most of?

584
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:43.770
It might be just chocolate,
like chocolate,
chocolate.
In other words,

585
00:37:43.771 --> 00:37:46.830
the chocolate cake style was,
yeah,

586
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.350
you could do more than a few of those.

587
00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:53.220
Like that's what you want to eat multiples up.
So what I'm saying?
I think so.

588
00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:57.150
I mean,
uh,
you know,
with that stuff,

589
00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:59.580
I don't want something crazy.
I just want,
you know,

590
00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:04.520
I like powdered donut to like an old pattern.
The Gel,

591
00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:08.910
the gel or no,
no jelly.
No,
no,
no.
Wait,
I hate those.
And they're all squishy.

592
00:38:08.911 --> 00:38:12.240
And then the powder,
it gets all over your face and your mouth and your beard.

593
00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:16.200
Yeah,
those,
so which one?
Okay.
So here's the thing.

594
00:38:16.201 --> 00:38:19.170
Now if you're going to do a challenge,
which I think,

595
00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:21.510
I feel like I should challenge,
this is where it's happening.

596
00:38:21.511 --> 00:38:24.930
Someone to do it though,
right?
I don't know.
Sitting alone and doing it,

597
00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:28.110
they think it's better to have competition.
Well who are you thinking?

598
00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:31.500
I mean obviously we know a really fat guys.

599
00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.980
Are you serious?
Well,
I mean he's fat and

600
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.910
<v 2>I'm sure there's a challenge.
Should we try to call him?
Let me see if</v>

601
00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:45.160
there's no way he wouldn't do this.
But wait,
before you call him,

602
00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:48.930
we need to determine what type of donut this will be cause.

603
00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:51.370
Cause here's our thinking.
Okay.
We were talking about this yesterday.

604
00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:53.130
There's the regular cake donut,

605
00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:57.400
let's say chocolate with chocolate frosting versus the donut hole.

606
00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.890
Now a lot of people will be like,

607
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:04.480
oh clearly it's harder to eat the whole doughnut with the frosting.
I could eat,

608
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:07.600
you know,
more of the whole,
I saw many more holes.

609
00:39:07.601 --> 00:39:11.010
The hole is the way to go because it's more fun.
You know,
you,

610
00:39:11.011 --> 00:39:15.500
you get a bunch you can look down and I I on,

611
00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:17.440
I don't think you can eat as many as you think.

612
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:22.210
Well that's a good part about it too.
Especially Mr. Exactly.
Yes.

613
00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:22.900
So let's see.

614
00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:26.710
I think you're going to get really sick quickly on those whole cause the sugar

615
00:39:26.711 --> 00:39:31.210
on those.
Ah,
Shit.
He's not answering his fucking full.
What?

616
00:39:31.211 --> 00:39:32.044
We'll set it up.

617
00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:37.150
I think the sugar content on a on a whole is it's a lot,

618
00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.510
cause I can only eat like two or three of those before I start to feel kind of

619
00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:45.250
time.
I think it's deceptive and I think,

620
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.240
I mean he's flying because it goes straight to my son though.

621
00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:52.580
<v 6>He's fine.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Shit.
Yeah.</v>

622
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.120
<v 2>Okay.
So,
so let's,</v>

623
00:39:54.121 --> 00:39:57.930
let's talk about your number then versus what you think he's going to say.

624
00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:01.290
I think so.
We're trying to Max out here.
Right?

625
00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:04.230
And you're trying to map in a timeframe to,
it's got to be within a time.

626
00:40:04.231 --> 00:40:06.840
Can you tell me what are you comfortable with?
Here's a,
here's the deal.

627
00:40:06.841 --> 00:40:10.110
We're going to set up the parameters with Bert.
Yeah.
So that we,

628
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:13.080
we set up the game.
How many,
I think,

629
00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:17.310
I'm trying to think like eating cat because I also don't want to do like a in a

630
00:40:17.311 --> 00:40:20.820
minute or something,
you know?
Oh,
that sucks.
Here's the thing.
I don't want to see,

631
00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:25.710
I don't want the hot dog eating the Nathan's thing where you're cramming and

632
00:40:25.711 --> 00:40:28.980
it's a quick,
you know what I'm saying?
It doesn't have to be that.

633
00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:33.330
It can be like in a leisurely enough of a pace.
I'm talking,
I want to see volume.

634
00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.120
I want to see,
I want to see quantity.

635
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.480
<v 6>How about,
um,
12 minutes.</v>

636
00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:45.580
<v 2>12 sounds good.
Uh,
down at,
uh,
yeah,
two three.
There you go.</v>

637
00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:48.220
That's funny.
Yeah.
12 minutes.

638
00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:54.240
<v 6>12 minutes.
Okay.
How many a minute?
Let's see.
Casually.
Um,</v>

639
00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.610
he's not going to be casual.
No,
he's not.
He's going to go up.

640
00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:00.910
But that's the thing.
It's almost like which strategy do you want to use,
right?

641
00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:06.280
I mean,
do you think we could do 40 in 12 minutes?
Oh my God.

642
00:41:06.281 --> 00:41:10.840
That's so many of you think sec,
dude.
I think past 10,

643
00:41:10.841 --> 00:41:14.860
you're gonna of Barf.
Oh 10 is nothing.
Come on.
Here's the thing.

644
00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.860
I think after two dozen I would feel pretty sick.

645
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:22.270
And then it's how much further can you push it?
Past sickness.
Yeah.

646
00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:27.490
So I mean after 24 be like,
oof,
that's a lot.
Feel pretty gross.

647
00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:34.610
It's a lot of sugar.
It's like cake.
Yeah.
And then like so much.

648
00:41:34.611 --> 00:41:38.480
And your stomach.
Yeah.
And I'm going to vomit.
Yeah,
you're going to be sick.

649
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:43.460
You're going to want to anyways.
Yeah.
You can't digest all that Shit,
right?

650
00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:47.480
[inaudible] what's your dump going to be like after all that?
Sugar.

651
00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:50.300
That's just a crazy sugar.
Sugar Binge.

652
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:57.050
Should I go for 40 that's so crazy,
Tommy.
No 20 no,

653
00:41:57.051 --> 00:42:00.620
that's so easy.
That's not even a challenge.
20 of those is disgusting,

654
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:03.110
but it's not a challenge though.
I'm saying I could just fly through.

655
00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:07.460
I know I could.
Are you going to train for this?
No.
No.
Just show up.

656
00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:11.270
Let's say for,
I'll say 40 okay.

657
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:14.450
And then what do you think he's going to say?

658
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:19.640
Definitely if I say 40 he's going to go.
Yeah.
But I think,

659
00:42:19.641 --> 00:42:22.880
well let's let him say his number first or,
well,
we already said it,

660
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.050
so he's like this tall people are going to tag them on it for sure.

661
00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.460
I think if I think I would challenge him,
I would be like,

662
00:42:31.461 --> 00:42:32.790
do you think you can do 80 I'll,

663
00:42:32.791 --> 00:42:37.791
I'll just start with that just to see if he's like course metallurgy it easy.

664
00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:41.210
We'll do a hundred now.

665
00:42:41.211 --> 00:42:44.930
He does have a high tolerance for sugar because of his alcoholism.

666
00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:49.340
He also has a high tolerance for indulgence.
Yeah.
Like,
you know what I mean?

667
00:42:49.341 --> 00:42:54.260
Just for like taking it in.
So yeah,
he does.
He he gorgeous a lot.

668
00:42:54.261 --> 00:42:58.640
Yeah.
Yeah.
But that's the thing is even the 40 thing,

669
00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.970
that's not really that crazy of a number.
It's almost like I'm,

670
00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:06.470
I'm predicting it based on how sick I want it feel,
because in truth I could,

671
00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:09.830
I could,
I could eat more,
but I already,

672
00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:14.540
I'm already picturing how sick I'm going to feel doing this and I really just

673
00:43:14.541 --> 00:43:17.930
want him to see him even more.
Like that's,
that's the goal.

674
00:43:17.931 --> 00:43:20.810
So maybe we just make your number lowers that.

675
00:43:20.811 --> 00:43:25.250
He no higher.
He's going to,

676
00:43:25.251 --> 00:43:29.180
he's going to try it out to you.
Yeah.
Now here's the other question.

677
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:34.210
Do we go store bought Entenmann's Ah,
no,

678
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:39.210
we go a fresh donut.
How's does,
do we go gas station?
No,

679
00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:42.680
those packs with like the chocolate,
the sediment.

680
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:46.220
The fake ass powders are not cool.
No.

681
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:50.840
So where do we get the donuts?
It's got to be a little bit of a shock.
Donut shop.

682
00:43:50.841 --> 00:43:52.430
Yeah.
We'll talk to them.
We'll set up like,

683
00:43:52.431 --> 00:43:55.880
we're going to buy this many no fucking way.

684
00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:00.500
My Mommy's to get those shitty ass Entenmann's uh,
the,

685
00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:04.100
the powder ones with the red jelly in the middle or the hostess.

686
00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:07.710
She was so fucking nasty dude.
It's,
by the way,
somebody,

687
00:44:07.711 --> 00:44:12.711
I'm noticed they were watching it back episodes and when our son was baptized,

688
00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:20.720
it's episode three 53 mom's house.
Um,

689
00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:24.920
you're talking about how your dad couldn't make it.
Yes.

690
00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:28.040
And he went overseas.
Where'd he go?
Do you remember?

691
00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:33.930
She was at Vietnam.
Yes.
And made a prediction and they pulled it.
Stop it.

692
00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:37.630
Yeah.
So you know,
we had,
we had a great time.
Yeah,
it was great.
It was going to,

693
00:44:37.631 --> 00:44:40.950
our son's going to heaven now and hopefully we'll have a cool pictures from

694
00:44:40.951 --> 00:44:45.810
Vietnam too.
Maybe I'll have a new mom.
I don't know.

695
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:47.320
I forgot to check this.
Just

696
00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:53.670
did your new mom.
Wow.

697
00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:57.790
<v 2>My Vietnam.
If you,
wow.
Isn't that interesting?</v>

698
00:44:57.791 --> 00:45:01.000
I knew back then.
Yeah.
What a neat story.

699
00:45:01.001 --> 00:45:05.440
Maybe this is when the love connection began.
Who Knew?

700
00:45:05.441 --> 00:45:10.030
I mean it was an interesting choice that my father chose to go to Vietnam over

701
00:45:10.031 --> 00:45:12.670
attending his only grandchild's baptism.

702
00:45:12.671 --> 00:45:14.500
That in and of itself was a fun thing to do.

703
00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:17.940
<v 6>Deal with blank.
He's amazed.
Yeah,</v>

704
00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:21.293
there you go.

705
00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:25.790
<v 2>Well,
I wonder how many have,
yeah,
that was amazed.</v>

706
00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:29.390
How many half Vietnamese brothers and sisters I have.

707
00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:33.670
What do you thought Alastair found it?
Thank you Alistair.
How many?
Oh,

708
00:45:33.671 --> 00:45:38.671
how many siblings do you think I have worldwide is the real question.

709
00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:42.640
There's no way it's done.
There's no way.
It's none.
I know.

710
00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:48.040
I mean he's been straight bang in since 1980 I would say like hardcore dropping

711
00:45:50.001 --> 00:45:54.650
seeds in bitches internationally and like your dad,

712
00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:59.390
he is not of the generation that's like responsible for,
you know what I mean?

713
00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:03.470
<v 6>No,
I talk about it on stage,
how
I didn't,</v>

714
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:06.440
I mean my dad told me that he didn't,

715
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:09.960
he's never ever pull it out.
It's crazy.

716
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:15.270
Like jump and clips and people always just did it and he was like,
yeah.
I'm like,

717
00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:20.520
how did you know that you wouldn't get pregnant?
He was like,
oh look.

718
00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:23.580
They would say we don't care.
I'm like,
yeah,

719
00:46:23.581 --> 00:46:26.370
but in your dad's doing it around the world

720
00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:31.430
<v 2>international clip dumps for a long,
since 1980 dude,</v>

721
00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:35.390
most of his adult life has been spent just Pam,
Pam,

722
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:38.840
<v 6>third world countries or I'll be your mouth open your mouth.</v>

723
00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:45.310
<v 2>There is no way.
I bet you man.
I'll bet she when he kicks it,</v>

724
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:49.030
I'm going to have people coming out of the woodwork like I'm your half brother.

725
00:46:49.031 --> 00:46:53.740
I'll be like,
you fucking do look like me.
Like a half Vietnamese brothers sister.

726
00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:58.030
That'd be crazy.
Well be nice to have siblings.
I mean,

727
00:46:58.031 --> 00:47:01.570
I am an only child.
I welcome,
I welcome you,

728
00:47:01.571 --> 00:47:06.250
my international sibling's wherever you guys are.
Thailand also,
he visits

729
00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:09.820
the Philippines,
places like that.

730
00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:15.710
<v 6>Can I have siblings?
They're all kinds of stuff happened in there.
Um,</v>

731
00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:19.120
it's so crazy.
I can't believe it that we predicted.

732
00:47:19.121 --> 00:47:23.560
I predicted this Vn your mommy's little question that's been bugging me for a

733
00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:26.350
few days.
I thought the two of you were the only ones who could help.

734
00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:30.010
If your arm was caught off at the shoulder,
would you still need to wear

735
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.980
<v 0>deodorant?
Furthermore,
would you for appearances sake,</v>

736
00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:38.410
shaved the lack of armpit hair or just rock the hairy shoulder mount?

737
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:43.500
Thanks,
Jeanne.
Brett p s piss on me.
Beat me.
Yup.
Yup,
Yup.

738
00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:48.970
Hmm.
Well,
I think if you are cut off at the shoulder,

739
00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:52.810
you don't have to wear deodorant because there's no pitch.
No pit.
Yeah.
Yeah.

740
00:47:52.811 --> 00:47:56.860
There's no nothing covered.
Like there's,
yeah,
there's no sweat.
Yeah.

741
00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:59.750
It's just open air.
It's like putting deodorant on

742
00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:04.660
<v 2>back or something.
You know,
I was watching Britain's,
it was,</v>

743
00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:07.840
what's it called?
Shut-Ins bread.
Britain's fattest people.
Yeah.

744
00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:13.170
And it's only where the folds of fat are that these people would kind of take a

745
00:48:13.631 --> 00:48:17.980
wet rag and wash between the places you want to deodorize the places that are

746
00:48:17.981 --> 00:48:22.960
mashed together.
Sure.
So yes,
I think they are pretty big,
right?
Yeah.

747
00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:26.560
Trauma.
I mean that's all in stones.
You lay 28 stone.
I'm like,

748
00:48:26.561 --> 00:48:28.360
I don't know what that shit is.
I had to look it up,

749
00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:32.010
but I'm a pretty massive people that that's a good one.
Britain's Britain's um,

750
00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:35.410
vast,
yeah.
Written off people.
Yeah.
Yeah.

751
00:48:35.411 --> 00:48:40.270
It's not a cold burns fat as people.
It's called like shut-ins.
Right?

752
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:42.520
Uh,
Britain's,
yeah.
Fantast

753
00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:45.580
<v 0>here's another email at mommy's and writing this while the scene in episode four</v>

754
00:48:45.581 --> 00:48:49.330
42,
you're debating the cleanliness of the soap bar in the ass.
Sure.

755
00:48:49.450 --> 00:48:51.730
You are assuming that nothing can live on the soap bar,

756
00:48:51.731 --> 00:48:53.680
but I have a grade eight science fair,

757
00:48:53.681 --> 00:48:57.070
a gold medal that says otherwise owe her my experiment.

758
00:48:57.071 --> 00:48:59.740
I had subjects place their hands on petri dishes,

759
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:02.320
then wash their hands with a used bar of soap,

760
00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:06.190
then place their hands on another petri dish after incubating the dishes.

761
00:49:06.191 --> 00:49:07.240
At my dad's lab,

762
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:12.630
it was shown that the post wash dishes contained more bacteria then the prewash

763
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:17.800
dishes,
thus demonstrating that bacteria thrives on soap bars.
Shit,

764
00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:21.870
you're running the bar across your ass.
There's shit bacteria on that bar.
Hold.

765
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.860
Hope that helps.
I got to run.

766
00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:28.750
I had a homeless black thug coming over to fuck me in the ass regards.
Chris.

767
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:32.840
<v 2>This helps.
I love that.
That's a helpful email.
Thank you,
Chris.</v>

768
00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:36.390
<v 0>Really helpful.
Thank you very much for that.
Um,</v>

769
00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:41.280
so yeah,
that is a,
here is,
where is it?
Nope,
I don't have it here.

770
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:44.990
Fuck.
Oh,
here it is.
Um,

771
00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:49.330
<v 2>not going to stop me.
My,
I read a tweet that I had come in.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

772
00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:51.680
I was just going to say that with regard to that message.

773
00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:54.380
I definitely won't stop doing that.
No,
neither will lie.

774
00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:59.330
And I believe it builds a resilience,
a tolerance to these types of bacteria.

775
00:49:59.331 --> 00:50:02.600
It's fine.
You and I have not gotten sick so far.
Uh,

776
00:50:02.601 --> 00:50:04.790
you gotta you gotta live your life.
I can't,

777
00:50:04.791 --> 00:50:07.830
I can't be worrying about every fucking germ.
True.
What I mean true.

778
00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:11.730
Now Tom,
and this one's for you.

779
00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:15.480
You're not going to like this.
But,
um,

780
00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:19.580
in light of our open defecation conversation a while back,

781
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:23.660
the tweets have been pouring in.
The emails have been pouring.

782
00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.350
<v 0>I know him.
I know what you're about to say.</v>

783
00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:27.120
<v 2>Well,
let me read a tweet.
Okay,</v>

784
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:31.130
let me quote the listeners on this one are very fired up at you.

785
00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:35.990
This one comes in from CJ foster.
He says,
Whoa,
hold on.

786
00:50:35.991 --> 00:50:40.420
Christina P and Thompson.
Sigora Tom said he never opened desiccated.

787
00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:44.700
What about the poo pile and his friends that he,

788
00:50:44.701 --> 00:50:49.240
him and his friends had hashtag serious news.
Uh,
yeah,
CJ,

789
00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:53.960
thank you.
And the many others,
the tweets,
the port and the emails.
Tom,

790
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:57.920
I'm going to ask you on behalf of all the mommies watching and listening,

791
00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:00.290
what about the poo pile?

792
00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:04.980
<v 0>Yeah,
it's a great question,
but it's um,
it's very easy.
The case,
um,</v>

793
00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:08.670
I saw it said open defecation.

794
00:51:08.671 --> 00:51:13.220
Open defecation is a song called open defecation.
I didn't realize that.

795
00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:17.710
Open defecation,
open defecation my ladies dissertation was on.
Yeah,

796
00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:18.580
that's cool.
Yeah.

797
00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:19.413
<v 7>And in fact,</v>

798
00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:24.160
many households in rural India don't prioritize having a latrine.

799
00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.910
So that's conveyor India to some other countries in the world.

800
00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:32.360
On the vertical axis,
at this graph we have the rate of open deprecation.

801
00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:37.470
<v 2>So I have a deaf,
a CACHACA.
Yeah.</v>

802
00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:38.660
<v 0>I'm curious about the song.</v>

803
00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:42.770
So here's the answer to people questioning open defecation versus the poop pile.

804
00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:46.790
Okay.
Uh,
the poop pile is a backyard.

805
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:51.200
And while that's outside,
no,
I just didn't consider open defecation.

806
00:51:51.201 --> 00:51:54.140
What she's talking about is people,
the way I interpreted it,

807
00:51:54.141 --> 00:51:57.590
it's like walking down the street,
finding just a,

808
00:51:57.650 --> 00:52:01.520
a place that is not designated for it and doing it.

809
00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:06.200
We had x marks,
the spot,
a ladder,
a group,

810
00:52:06.201 --> 00:52:09.740
people watching,
everybody's doing it.
So it wasn't like,

811
00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:15.290
it wasn't the same as saying like,
Oh yeah,
I just,
I had to go and I was a,

812
00:52:15.291 --> 00:52:18.200
I was in front of a business.
I just dropped trout and I took it.
That's why.

813
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.951
<v 2>So you're,</v>

814
00:52:18.951 --> 00:52:21.950
you're saying your interpretation was that as long as there is a designated

815
00:52:21.951 --> 00:52:25.400
location for somewhere to Poop,
it's,
it's,

816
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:27.020
it's not considered open.

817
00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:33.380
<v 0>I mean it was a dead,
first of all,
it's an enclosed backyard with a fence.
Trees.</v>

818
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:38.360
Um,
you know,
I just didn't think of that as as open defecation.
Yeah.

819
00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:42.790
<v 2>Right.
An NC NCI interpreted as many of our listeners did.
Um,</v>

820
00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:43.970
open and outside.

821
00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:49.160
Outside will our rather in an place other than a toilet.
Yeah.

822
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:52.340
No.
And I can see place designated for pooing.

823
00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:55.430
I can see how there's not many places you should pool.

824
00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:57.290
The toilet is the only place

825
00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:01.480
<v 0>Lester is a poo pile mark for you to pour it.
And that's exactly what we did.</v>

826
00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:02.730
And I'm going to see

827
00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:05.610
<v 2>my to poop pile comrades this weekend.</v>

828
00:53:05.611 --> 00:53:08.160
Actually I would like some kind of a testimony.

829
00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:12.030
Maybe a lie detectors situation.
Yeah,
I'm serious.

830
00:53:12.031 --> 00:53:15.150
I'm so sick of not knowing the truth behind this.
Ruth is here.

831
00:53:15.151 --> 00:53:16.440
I'm telling you the truth.
No,

832
00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:20.190
I want a lie detector test about this fucking poop pile and I think the

833
00:53:20.191 --> 00:53:24.090
listeners deserve it.
We can do it.
Great donut challenge.

834
00:53:24.091 --> 00:53:28.500
And then after that lie detector test.
Okay.
Might Affect your test.

835
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:33.520
Why not?
Is anyone out there a lie detector person?
We'll find somebody.

836
00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:38.250
Oh,
look how nervous you look already.
I see the fear in your eyes.

837
00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:39.420
Fear in my eyes.

838
00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:43.840
I was one of the founders of the poop pile when the,

839
00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:45.720
probably the best pool or in the whole group.

840
00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:49.800
Yet when the subjective pooping outside came up,

841
00:53:49.801 --> 00:53:53.910
it didn't even trigger a memory inside of you because it was designated as the

842
00:53:53.911 --> 00:53:58.170
place to go,
but an outdoor place to go.
Theoretically,

843
00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:01.110
it's an outdoor place to go,
but it's not.
I mean,

844
00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:03.960
I'm talking about people shitting on the side of the road,

845
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:06.690
shooting into the ponds,
shitting,
you know,

846
00:54:06.691 --> 00:54:09.900
like go into the lake at the park and taking a shit there.

847
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:13.890
That's what I interpret.
This was like,
Hey,
let's all do this together.

848
00:54:13.891 --> 00:54:16.380
Let's bond as friends.
It's friends and family.

849
00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:21.390
Walk me through this again at the poop pile that there is a ladder and then you

850
00:54:21.391 --> 00:54:25.710
mean to tell me that you hang your,
your ass off the top of the ladder.

851
00:54:25.711 --> 00:54:29.880
You're sitting down on top of a ladder.
It's like a makeshift ladder on a tree.

852
00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:32.920
Okay.
Again,
this makes this,

853
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.480
I don't know if this is the same story Lesnar's you guys are the experts.

854
00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:41.500
I'd go ahead and compare stories or past shifts like hoards nailed into a tree

855
00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:46.170
so that you can clients,
you know what I mean?
Like,
okay,
I'm listening.

856
00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:50.280
He dried diagram.
I mean I can't,
I could draw,
you can go ahead.

857
00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:55.110
There's a let's,
let's try to make this lie happen.
Go ahead.

858
00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:57.930
Sure.
Yana Brown lock here.

859
00:54:57.931 --> 00:55:00.870
And in fact that's how I spent two weeks of law school and go ahead.

860
00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:06.370
So
I'm trying to,

861
00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:08.640
it makes no sense to me.

862
00:55:08.641 --> 00:55:12.870
Makes a ton of sense that a group of guys at first of all the stench must have

863
00:55:12.871 --> 00:55:17.080
been overwhelming.
There's no way you want to shit on top of your friends shit.

864
00:55:17.081 --> 00:55:21.270
And this is so stupid and silly and so disgusting.

865
00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:26.760
Okay.
All right.
Let's see.
Let's see the physics of this.

866
00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:31.650
All right.
I'm trying to do,
what time of year did the poop pile take place?

867
00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:36.240
That would be a late spring,
early summer.
Oh,
so it's nice and hot.

868
00:55:36.241 --> 00:55:38.550
And this is in the south North Carolina.
Yeah.

869
00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:44.050
So you mean to tell me and the humid a southern boy,
a ball.

870
00:55:44.050 --> 00:55:46.500
Me Summer night.
Summer Day.

871
00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:49.290
You guys were taking turns shitting on a pile of pill.

872
00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:54.030
That's what you're trying to tell me this in proximity to your living space

873
00:55:54.210 --> 00:55:55.380
right there.
Right there.

874
00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:59.850
So you guys probably had windows open to for summer breezes and such,

875
00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:04.740
and you didn't mind the stench of a poop pile coming into your room.

876
00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:09.780
You didn't bother you guys to be next to a sewage dump.
Uh,
Tom,

877
00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:11.460
is that what you're telling me?

878
00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:15.820
And you had girls coming over and looking at your pile of shit.
Oh,
bullshit.
Yeah.

879
00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:19.170
I like to talk to one of those girls.
If you could produce said girl,

880
00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:23.740
if there's a woman out there that saw the poop pile,
let me know.
Okay.
All right,

881
00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:27.120
well that's something else.
Here is what would happen.
Yeah.

882
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:28.750
Here's like a big tree.
Okay.

883
00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:34.170
And then nailed into the tree are pieces of wood that would act as a ladder in

884
00:56:34.901 --> 00:56:36.400
other words.
Sure,
sure.
You know what I mean?

885
00:56:36.401 --> 00:56:39.390
You could call it like a child would use for a tree house.
Yeah.
Okay,

886
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:43.000
so you climb up this tree and then on this huge branch here,

887
00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:45.660
and then we had like a toilet seat out here.
Oh,

888
00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:51.070
that's a new addition to your story.
Well,
you know,
it's like it's,

889
00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:55.260
it's a makeshift,
totally annuity and then you hold onto this so you don't fall.

890
00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:58.570
What's that?
What is this that you're talking about?
What are you holding onto?

891
00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:03.300
It's like a metal bar that we nailed into the treaty.
Nail the Ma.
I didn't do it.

892
00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:07.440
It must be Casey.
Okay.
And then,
and then you just pooped,

893
00:57:07.441 --> 00:57:11.320
threw it into the poop pile there,
right?
This is the thing.
I was born yesterday.

894
00:57:11.350 --> 00:57:15.240
No,
I'm serious.
This is,
this is Loney.
No,
it's not blown.

895
00:57:15.241 --> 00:57:17.110
It really isn't Poo Baloney.

896
00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:21.210
We did this for a while and a lot of people pooped off of,
this is so dumb.

897
00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:23.830
You don't understand the Carolinas.
No,
I understand.

898
00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:28.480
A bunch of 20 year old guys and their primary motivation is to get laid not to

899
00:57:28.481 --> 00:57:30.210
shit on top of each other.
Shit.
Hmm.

900
00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:33.850
You really think this was going to help you get laid in college.

901
00:57:33.851 --> 00:57:34.780
You weren't thinking like that.

902
00:57:34.810 --> 00:57:38.590
We're thinking more like bonding with our neighborhood,
the group experience.

903
00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:43.450
And your neighbors didn't mind the smell of human who wafting,
right.

904
00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:46.330
Summer nights primitive.
We were,
we were all into it.

905
00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:49.570
Yana you're the main thing is that when you would call out that you're going to

906
00:57:49.571 --> 00:57:53.110
do it.
So many people that run who,
who would run towards this neighborhood,

907
00:57:53.111 --> 00:57:57.350
kids and other adults or the lion.
No,

908
00:57:57.351 --> 00:58:00.790
I'm serious.
The lie is that,
let's see what this song is.

909
00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:02.160
I don't remember this one.
Okay.

910
00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:03.493
<v 8>That's the case.</v>

911
00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:17.203
That's the case.

912
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:26.103
Okay.

913
00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:32.570
It's like equine diarrhea.

914
00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:39.260
Diarrhea is quite diarrhea,

915
00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:45.950
diarrhea decline.
I've seen the guy shouldn't Nally sorry guys.
Shit.

916
00:58:45.970 --> 00:58:49.520
Downtown.
Anytime you have the urge to shit,
you would just drop trout

917
00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:55.350
<v 2>as DJ show reference with the variation.
Really good.
But yeah,
no,</v>

918
00:58:55.590 --> 00:58:58.440
the poop pile is definitely real.
And um,

919
00:58:59.130 --> 00:59:02.640
I understand why people were questioning.
And the more you tell the story,

920
00:59:02.641 --> 00:59:06.840
the more senseless it becomes and the less sense it makes.

921
00:59:06.841 --> 00:59:11.520
And the more detail that you,
the more webs of lies they go into the poop pile.

922
00:59:11.521 --> 00:59:14.470
It's,
it's utter nonsense.
This is nonsense.
I Dunno.

923
00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:18.430
Anything you're talking about right now,
but it's complete lies.
Okay.

924
00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:22.430
You're out of your fucking mind with this stuff.
I'm not,
I'm not,
I'm really not.

925
00:59:24.070 --> 00:59:28.370
I'm trying to help you.
I'm really trying to help you.
Okay.
Um,

926
00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:34.010
what do I want to scanning?
Oh,
speaking a scatting.
Yeah.
Everyone was really,

927
00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:38.510
really into scatting and it's,
it's so cool.
And

928
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:46.960
we look at the people go crazy for them doing this too.

929
00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:53.510
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

930
01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:10.250
no doubt.
No

931
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:13.363
doubt.

932
01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:23.333
Ooh,

933
01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:27.580
<v 2>my favorite now these are two very talented individual Ella Fitzgerald for me.</v>

934
01:00:27.581 --> 01:00:30.510
Yeah.
She really is super talented people and there,

935
01:00:30.511 --> 01:00:33.450
this is annoying the shit out of me.
Terrible.
Terrible.
Yeah.

936
01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.240
I could listen to Ella Fitzgerald singing all day,
but yeah,

937
01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:37.680
this is fucking nonsense

938
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:46.783
<v 9>hoodie.</v>

939
01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.000
<v 2>I like.
Yeah,</v>

940
01:00:49.001 --> 01:00:51.760
but like the people sitting next to that because like your cousin Brian in the

941
01:00:51.761 --> 01:00:55.030
front,
your cousin Brian would love something like this is my face right here.

942
01:00:55.170 --> 01:00:59.200
Yes.
Fuck.
Are they doing,
do you know what I'm saying?

943
01:00:59.201 --> 01:01:02.770
This is the same audience member who thinks that like,
um,

944
01:01:02.830 --> 01:01:06.820
remember that movie that came out a while ago that was silent?
Yeah.
Years ago.

945
01:01:06.850 --> 01:01:10.150
They made a silent movie and this is the person on the academy that votes for

946
01:01:10.151 --> 01:01:15.100
things like that.
Like,
oh,
what a treasure,
what an artistic treasure.

947
01:01:15.101 --> 01:01:15.934
This crap.

948
01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:17.873
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

949
01:01:18.850 --> 01:01:22.480
<v 2>Tom,
let's do our duet like they're doing where he answers and ready.
Yeah.</v>

955
01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:49.080

That was great.
We should be hosting whenever a piece of shit.</v>

956
01:01:49.081 --> 01:01:51.930
That thing was,
well,
maybe we could get better at it.

957
01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:57.050
I'm not sure if we can loud from singer sacred and today's video is for all of

958
01:01:57.521 --> 01:02:01.760
my jazz singers out there.
Oh Shit.
I'm just be looking at sketching.

959
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:05.930
Even if you don't sing jazz and you've never scouted before,

960
01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:09.830
you will still get a lot out of this video.
Okay.
Pause.
In order to stack,

961
01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:14.860
you actually have to have a few Ninja music things going on in order to get it

962
01:02:15.111 --> 01:02:19.070
going.
We still did that benefit your entire thinking vibe.
Anyway,

963
01:02:19.650 --> 01:02:23.070
so what is Scott?
Well,

964
01:02:23.071 --> 01:02:27.480
if you've never heard of scat before,
it sounds like a base.
Oh No,
don't do it.

965
01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:30.000
Please.
[inaudible]

966
01:02:31.590 --> 01:02:36.590
that kind of using nonsense syllables to basically turn your voice into an

967
01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:41.160
instrument because there's no instruments around or you don't have the ability

968
01:02:41.161 --> 01:02:43.280
to play them.
Yeah,
yeah.
It's tremendous.

969
01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:48.090
Very similar to the way that a whole one would be up on stage sort of saxophone

970
01:02:48.091 --> 01:02:52.830
or a trumpet.
It's not.
No,
of course not.
It doesn't sound,

971
01:02:52.831 --> 01:02:56.820
it just sounds like it.
Like you said,
a two year old playing pretend.
Yeah,

972
01:02:57.090 --> 01:02:59.330
it's annoying.
We should nominate our son for a grantee

973
01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.353
<v 9>pop.</v>

974
01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:09.990
<v 2>This is what infants do on their crib at night before they fall asleep.</v>

975
01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:12.330
When they wake up,
they kind of babbled to themselves.

976
01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:17.010
It's the same shit is so fucking retarded.
I mean,
this is,

977
01:03:17.011 --> 01:03:19.140
uh,
another,
check this out.

978
01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:24.270
Each contestant will have to Scott for as long as possible without taking a

979
01:03:24.271 --> 01:03:28.390
breath.
Oh No.
I have scattered professionally.
Um,

980
01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:32.450
and I'm pretty well known for my scap style boots.

981
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:37.320
Ski in the Midwest and welcome to the big leagues sweetheart.
Sick Dude,

982
01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:38.940
dude,
dude,
dude.

983
01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:43.190
She's off to a very controlled the notes that you need a commentator,

984
01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:49.560
<v 7>he showed you millions of die.
Scott fans back in the Midwest.
Roofing.</v>

985
01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:51.020
Sonia on right about now.

986
01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:54.330
<v 2>Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee,
and she's not disappointing.</v>

987
01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:59.020
Dave Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee,

988
01:03:59.910 --> 01:04:02.040
outstanding Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.

989
01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:13.080
<v 7>Bring it home.
Girlfriends,
girlfriends out thought.
Ah,</v>

990
01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:16.650
and there you have it.
Where districts checkers.
Yeah,

991
01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:19.090
Sonia seems quite disappointed.

992
01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:21.160
<v 2>I would have a little distracted by the band.</v>

993
01:04:21.161 --> 01:04:24.430
I really wanted to grow with them and then before I know it ahead,

994
01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:28.060
I had to hold my guys staring at you.
Jump Out,

995
01:04:29.050 --> 01:04:31.000
jump out the hole with the scad,
but it was cool.

996
01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:35.260
Next up is Terry who needs to be 36 seconds for the title.

997
01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:39.390
<v 7>Oh that,</v>

998
01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:44.390
that that though I'm not quite sure exactly what style terrorist going with the

999
01:04:45.050 --> 01:04:49.410
style and everyone really even qualify as a star on the toe,

1000
01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:55.220
but you definitely can't question that young man's heart and back and back and

1001
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:59.600
back.
He's hot.

1002
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:03.520
<v 2>It was this like this is a gag video actually.
Oh right.
Cause must be,</v>

1003
01:05:04.070 --> 01:05:07.900
well I thought the lady before him actually,
she seemed sincere really was like,

1004
01:05:07.930 --> 01:05:10.600
yeah,
doing it at this.
This is clearly over the

1005
01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:15.860
[inaudible] pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,

1006
01:05:16.550 --> 01:05:20.130
pop nonsense.
It's the worst.
Um,

1007
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:24.400
we'll be working on a scat album for those of you guys that are interested in a

1008
01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:26.710
quick how many,
we're just going to do scat from now on.
Yeah.

1009
01:05:26.770 --> 01:05:27.670
There's such a demand.

1010
01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:31.430
<v 6>Yeah.
Um,
Jeez.</v>

1011
01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:32.613
<v 2>Let's see what this,</v>

1012
01:05:32.830 --> 01:05:36.110
I want it to read another email that came in our tweet rather.
Yeah.

1013
01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:41.130
<v 6>Yeah.
Last time we were asking how is it</v>

1014
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:45.510
<v 2>that tattoo artists learn how to Tattoo?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That was cool.</v>

1015
01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:50.730
This came in from lefthanded Morty on Twitter and he writes,
Hey,

1016
01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:55.770
tattoo artist's practice on pig skin before they ever tattoo a person.

1017
01:05:56.050 --> 01:06:00.720
Pig Skin is very similar to human skin and if you wrap it around a mannequin

1018
01:06:00.721 --> 01:06:05.400
body part,
it is a great training tool for aspiring tattoo artists.

1019
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:09.330
Um,
that,
so that makes a lot of sense.
Now that makes sense,
doesn't it?

1020
01:06:09.331 --> 01:06:10.950
That's pretty cool.
Very interesting.

1021
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:17.100
Speaking of a Schema do bat.
Oh,
cool.
Things a little quick.

1022
01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:22.020
Quick Stop off in studio g here.
Oh,
shut up real quick one.
You're kidding.

1023
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:24.360
Wait a minute.
Have I not been up on him?

1024
01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:26.950
<v 7>You're listen.
Oh Fudge.</v>

1025
01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:30.660
The dream still lives and my dream is for us to love one another.

1026
01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:32.400
All of us.

1027
01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:37.150
<v 2>Oh,
that's right.
Sorry.
I did see this is so ridiculous,
right.</v>

1028
01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:43.680
<v 6>It's really reminiscent of,
I like that.
Yeah,
I really liked that.</v>

1029
01:06:43.890 --> 01:06:45.230
Yeah.
Yeah.

1030
01:06:45.350 --> 01:06:48.980
<v 2>He's so,
he's so phony.
It's just reads so false.
It doesn't,
it</v>

1031
01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:54.140
<v 6>uh,
his beard needs well,
yes.
I was going to say that.
Yeah.
Let's see it.</v>

1032
01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:57.250
<v 7>Do you love one another?
All of us.</v>

1033
01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:58.970
<v 6>Oh my gosh.</v>

1034
01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:03.270
I bet he's just insufferable.
Yeah.

1035
01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:05.940
<v 2>I remember when,
um,
he was like,</v>

1036
01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:09.690
he was interrupted doing studio g for his birthday and he was like,

1037
01:07:09.691 --> 01:07:12.940
is this supposed to happen?
It's going on here.
Yeah.
He,
he wasn't that night.

1038
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:14.420
Was that?
Yeah.

1039
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:15.543
<v 7>All of us.</v>

1040
01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:19.500
<v 6>Ah,
he's creepy.
Super Creep.</v>

1041
01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:22.400
He needs beard help.
Definitely.

1042
01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:25.300
He needs to grow it out a lot more than the other guys should get together.

1043
01:07:25.350 --> 01:07:27.370
Go over their beards.
Definitely.
Yeah.

1044
01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:29.253
<v 2>That's good.</v>

1045
01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:37.620
<v 6>What is this right here?
This old lady polluting her street by parking.</v>

1046
01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:41.880
Oh,
this is like an old lady losing her shit.
You want to see it?
Yup.
Okay.

1047
01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:46.093
What

1048
01:07:46.890 --> 01:07:51.390
<v 2>Shit are you literally uh,
it's none of your business.
God Damn phone.</v>

1049
01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:56.010
No Man.
Get off your goddamn phone.
Are you my mom?

1050
01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:01.710
Mommy,
Mommy.
Jesus.
Jesus Christ.

1051
01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:05.680
Where's you'll back to Africa?
We have wrong.
Oh Wow.

1052
01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:10.130
Wow.
She's got a croquet.

1053
01:08:11.930 --> 01:08:15.250
She's real crazy.
Yeah.
She got a buzz cut.
You see that?
She does that.

1054
01:08:15.251 --> 01:08:15.980
We're really clear

1055
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:20.600
<v 6>cut.
Yeah.
She,
she's only missing that guy's beard cause she has his haircut.</v>

1056
01:08:20.810 --> 01:08:24.160
The,
yeah,

1057
01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:28.640
that's a lead with that.
She just was like,
God,
here go to Africa.

1058
01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:34.960
<v 11>Doesn't matter.
This is public.</v>

1059
01:08:34.961 --> 01:08:38.830
This is public property.
This belongs to this.
See,
this is what Hans did.
A city.

1060
01:08:40.110 --> 01:08:44.410
You'll get the fuck outta here.
Get outta here.
Go back into your house.

1061
01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:49.770
<v 6>I like him.
I also liked to get the shit out of here is not an expression.</v>

1062
01:08:50.190 --> 01:08:53.250
It's fuck.
And he corrected her was like,
get the fuck Outta here.

1063
01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:57.370
<v 11>Well,
Becky through a house check your goddamn house.
No,</v>

1064
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:04.580
no.
I like,
I like fucking this specific spot.
Me Too.

1065
01:09:08.830 --> 01:09:09.700
<v 6>He is right though.</v>

1066
01:09:09.701 --> 01:09:12.910
And I hate when people think that the front of their house belong to them.

1067
01:09:12.911 --> 01:09:16.210
It doesn't belong to the city.
If you're on the street,
you're on the street.
Yeah,

1068
01:09:16.211 --> 01:09:18.130
Dude.
I know one likes for the record.

1069
01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:21.730
No one likes cars parked in front of their house.
Same Way.

1070
01:09:21.731 --> 01:09:25.360
But you're allowed to of course it's public property.
Yeah.
Stupid.

1071
01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:27.070
I almost liked it.
Um,

1072
01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:31.510
it seems like her level of anger doesn't match her face entirely.
Oh.

1073
01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:35.800
Like she was kind of flat.
Like the expression is kind of strange.
She was like,

1074
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:39.610
get Outta here now,
but she's not.
You know what I mean?

1075
01:09:39.611 --> 01:09:42.830
Like it's just like start reading in her eyes.
It's interesting.
Shit.

1076
01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:44.950
Too much botox.
What did I do to you?

1077
01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:50.020
<v 11>Shut up.
Shut up.
Nobody's threatening you.</v>

1078
01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:53.980
I'm polluting your sweet.
You should just go back into your house,

1079
01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:57.710
polluting your street.
Since when did the street belonged to you?
Yeah.

1080
01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:01.570
She's a real quick get the hell Nah.

1081
01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:06.710
<v 6>If I were this guy,
I might come back and park here every day for this show.</v>

1082
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:09.290
God Damn,
she's real fired up.

1083
01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:16.220
I'll go,
fuck.
I don't give a fuck.

1084
01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:20.203
You done.

1085
01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:28.400
You think she's just old and crazy?
Yeah,
she's angry.
She's just full of rage.

1086
01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:30.560
She flipped out actually at first,

1087
01:10:30.561 --> 01:10:33.670
just the anger started with who was parked in front of my house.
Yeah.

1088
01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:37.380
And then she had to take it up a notch.
Cut.

1089
01:10:38.190 --> 01:10:41.180
She's really angry though.
Hell,
you think she is

1090
01:10:43.210 --> 01:10:44.960
80 something?

1091
01:10:45.310 --> 01:10:48.710
I was going to think like 47 48 now she's way up.

1102
01:11:45.630 --> 01:11:48.750
I don't know.

He just,

1103
01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:56.900
So the cars,
the people listening,

1104
01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:00.290
there's a car on a tow truck like on the upward,

1105
01:12:00.291 --> 01:12:05.200
like a double decker and it starts to roll off and the guy jumps together.

1106
01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:09.700
<v 9>He just jumps one that's not that fun.</v>

1107

but something happens.

1121
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:43.070
Why are you laughing?
I don't know why you're laughing.

1122
01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:47.000
That's like my worst nightmare.

1123
01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:54.783
<v 7>Oh God.</v>

1124
01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:01.730
Okay.

1125

<v 2>Yeah.
And then when he cries,
does that make you laugh?</v>

1127
01:14:22.330 --> 01:14:24.180
What grown poor man in the military.

<v 2>I can't believe you don't find those so mentally disturbed.</v>

1130
01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:35.670
You got to bring this to your therapist.

1171
01:17:45.251 --> 01:17:48.520
Sir David the bark.
I try to be cutting edge information.

1172
01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:54.120
I have found a new scientific way to enjoy,

1173
01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:57.670
um,
our sex organs now.
Now sit down.

01:17:57.671 --> 01:17:59.830
Don't anybody stand up in here?

1175
01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:03.430

No Pun intended.
Huh?</v>

1178
01:18:14.110 --> 01:18:17.470
I wish I'd known about this when I was at Byu.

1179
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:22.870
I just knew I was going into outer darkness because I would masturbate and I

1180
01:18:22.871 --> 01:18:25.540
thought,
oh my God,
you know,
when we die,

1181
01:18:25.541 --> 01:18:29.920
everything we've ever did according to the Mormons are going to be on videotape

1182
01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:33.350

Geez,

1183
01:18:33.351 --> 01:18:35.500

I'm just the like,
okay,
I'm just the reporter.</v>

1186
01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:49.550
Don't kill the Messenger.
Okay.
This is called Dick.

1187
01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:53.480
D.

1188

Soak in the Mormon faith.

1193
01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:13.470
Couples who wish to engage in premarital activities,

1194
01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:18.540
but you do not want to dishonor their faith.
Use the Dick soak method.

1195
01:19:20.670 --> 01:19:25.470
The [inaudible] method occurs when the males erect a member,
uh,

1196
01:19:25.471 --> 01:19:29.730
is placed inside the female vagina and lay still.

1199
01:19:40.771 --> 01:19:43.800
battle and lay down in hi.
Hi.
Oh No.

1200
01:19:43.801 --> 01:19:46.440
I don't know too many little generals that are going to agree to this.

1201
01:19:47.010 --> 01:19:50.600
<v 6>That was Kinda top dog,
right?
That was very tough.
Dot.
He likes a little general.</v>

1202
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.310

The open defecation song.
That's the song.

1208
01:20:14.971 --> 01:20:17.790
So I guess you get to hear it in its entirety now.
That's why it was here.

1209
01:20:18.330 --> 01:20:21.420
All right.
